- I grew up hearing stories from the pages of the Bible, but did they really happen? This question led me to the ancient lands of the Middle East searching for patterns of evidence that matched the Biblical events. I wasn't prepared for what would be revealed. I had been interviewing people all over the world for years. Now, it was time to tell my story. As a filmmaker, investigating the Exodus and the writings of Moses, I was confronted by a new controversy. Most scholars don't think Moses could have written the early books of the Bible; but that is exactly what the Bible is claiming. These scholars think that Hebrew, the language of the Bible, wasn't even in existence at the time of Moses. This is the Moses controversy. But that is not where my journey began. I started this investigation back in 2002 searching for the path that Moses and the Israelites would have taken in their Exodus out of Egypt. Either he was something like that. - Do what? What interested me in the beginning was that I had heard of Exodus explorers claiming to have found remarkable evidence of a miraculous sea crossing where the Bible says God split the waters to allow the Israelites to pass. But brought the water back down on the Egyptians, destroying their chariots and army. These explorers claim to have found the remains of coral-encrusted chariot wheels on the bottom of the Red Sea. There were other Exodus explorers claiming to have found the real location of Mount Sinai with the remains of altars from the time when the Israelites met with God, and where Moses began to write the first books of the Bible. Could it be that after thousands of years, the real Exodus story was finally being discovered; one of the greatest stories of the Bible. - I think the Exodus story is fundamental because when you to understand the Bible, it's the history of Israel. Israel has no history apart from the Exodus. The Exodus defines the Jewish people. It's their self-identity. The whole understanding of the Passover, which throughout the Old Testament, you see that the Exodus is repeated over and over again. - Who would combine Passover offering matza. It's the God who brought you out of Egypt. Remember, go back to, these events happened. But I also interviewed scholars who dismissed the books of Moses as fanciful tales about the origins of the Israelites not written until long after the events. This caused me to put my investigation of the sea crossing and the journey to Mount Sinai on hold. I knew I could not investigate these events until I first determined whether Moses even had the ability to write down the details of the Exodus journey. This investigation would reveal one of the most profound discoveries I have ever encountered. - Another one going along in this direction. I traveled to some of today's leading universities to understand why mainstream scholars don't consider these early events of the Bible to be historical. Professor William Dever is one of America's premier archeologists who specializes in the history of Israel during Biblical times. Early in his 50 year career, he witnessed and actually participated in a revolutionary change of attitudes towards the Bible in the field of archeology. - I made my early reputation warring against traditional Biblical archeology. People say Dever's the man who killed Biblical archeology. No, I only observed its passing and wrote its obituary. The fact is that sort of archeology, tryin God to prove the Bible, wasn't working. I rebelled against my teachers when I was young because I thought there was much more to learn with different approaches to archeology. Today no one does that kind of prove the Bible archeology. Remember the Biblical writers exaggerate. Solomon was not quite that great and David didn't do all those things. I don't see Moses as the founder of Israelite religion and most scholars don't today. Professor Donald Redford has long been one of the world's most respected Egyptologists. He was given the award for Best Scholarly Book in archeology for his work Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times. He too is very critical of the early Bible stories, including the Exodus. - I would subject the Biblical one to 15 of Exodus to the same kind of historical probing that any historian will do. Who wrote this stuff? For whom did he write it? When did he write it? Very important, what did he know of the topic he was writing about? Boy in my research, Exodus one to 15 comes off very negatively. - What does negatively mean? - It does not reflect almost anything to do with the original incident. Retired university professor Doug Knight taught at Vanderbilt's Divinity School. He co-wrote The Meaning of the Bible, which is used in numerous colleges and seminaries. - Did Moses write the Torah? Frankly I don't think so. I think it was a product of a lot of other people much later than his time. - Interestingly, these three leading voices in the world of archeology, Egyptology, and Biblical studies have something in common: All were raised on conservative Bible-believing homes just as I was. Over time, these scholars became agnostic; at least in part because of the challenges they saw against the Bible, such as the lack of supporting evidence. Was that sort of the beginning of going from maybe a fundamentalist believer to an agnostic? - Yes, very much so. This is very personal that something had been put over on me and there was fraudulence involved. I still feel that way. - By exploring this topic, would I follow their same path? Or would I find answers to my questions and keep my faith? My parents met at a Bible college in Minneapolis. My mother got her degree in music and my father, a decorated Korean war vet, was studying to be a pastor. They married and I was their first child. On weekends we would travel to a country church in Wisconsin to help with services. My father, with his military background, ended up becoming a police officer. My family grew to include two sisters and a brother. Every week we attended Sunday School at church and would hear a different story from the Bible. That would have been the first time I learned about Moses and the Exodus. I would come to believe that these stories were true. As I grew older, I was taught that Moses was the author of the first books of the Bible, also known as the Torah or the Pentateuch. That is why what Professor Doug Knight said about the Bible not being written by Moses, but by multiple authors hundreds of years later was troubling to me. I asked Professor Dever about this. Let's talk about how common the view is that Moses wrote the Torah among scholars today. - I don't think any scholars would hold that view today. Even evangelical scholars make use of the documentary hypothesis for instance. Laypeople of course will believe that and orthodox Jews will believe that, orthodox rabbis. But I don't think any mainstream scholars would any longer hold that view. - Did the skepticism of Dever and the others come from a previous generation's paradigm? Because there are scholars with a different view. I traveled to Louisville, Kentucky. I wanted to ask some of the top evangelical scholars whether they have abandoned the thinking that Moses wrote the Torah. The question about Moses' authorship is a question that I've been investigating. Do you think Moses authored the first five books? - I think it comes from Moses himself. - And it comes from the time period he would have lived? That's right. - Professor Peter Gentry is a leading expert in the ancient Near East, working in a dozen ancient languages while specializing in Greek and the Semitic family. He spent 17 years at the University of Toronto in the same department where Donald Redford taught. - Many scholars today are just unaware of the latest advances in research on archeology, history, how the Hebrews did their writing, how Hebrew literature works. All of these things uphold the claims in the text and show that the criteria used to establish the documentary hypothesis is completely false. - Why haven't people acknowledged that? - I think if you're going to be a real scholar, if you're going to open yourself to the truth, we can't just copy what we're taught by our professors. We have to investigate the evidence. - Could there be evidence that the majority of scholars are missing? The more I thought about it, the more I realized that the attack on the credibility of the Bible starts here with the questions of who wrote the Bible and when was it written? The Exodus includes a series of fantastic miracles. It's an account that tells of God leading the Israelites out of Egypt across a vast wilderness. Pharaoh's army of chariots pursues them, trapping them at the sea. Then the sea parted, allowing the Israelites to pass through but destroying the Egyptians. The Israelites then went on to Mount Sinai to meet with God and receive the 10 Commandments. All this was said to be recorded by Moses as an eyewitness account that had details of the route out of Egypt, including camp sites. To investigate this route, I would need to look at the geographical descriptions and identifications given in the text for the journey because some of these sites might still be locatable. But if Moses didn't record this and it was just a later invention, then what would be the point of searching for evidence of the route taken by the Israelites? Since the rest of the Bible is based on the writings of Moses, the credibility of the Exodus and the entire Bible is directly connected to the question of Moses' authorship. Can any of it be trusted? So it's clear that the big question in this investigation needs to be this: Did Moses have the ability to write the book of Exodus as an eyewitness account? If Moses began writing the first five books of the Bible during the Exodus, when did that occur? That's a dating question that brings us back to Egypt because it supplies all the archeological dates for that region of the world. In a previous film called Patterns of - The Exodus, I created a wall of time to help visualize the different time periods I was investigating. The wall of time allowed me to simply compare the events of Egypt's history on the first level with events recorded in the Bible on the second level. At the bottom was a timeline of absolute dates and a movable base to gauge the events of history, with great pylons marking every thousand years. Over the last century, the dominant view among scholars has been the assumption that if the six steps of the Exodus happened, it must have been during Egypt's new kingdom at the time of its most famous Pharaoh, Ramesses II around 1250 B.C. This is known as the Ramesses Exodus Theory. However, my previous investigation highlighted clear Biblical evidence pointing to an earlier Exodus state closer to 1450 B.C., rather than 1250 B.C. The kind of writing system Moses used must have been in place by 1450 B.C. Throughout history, all known Torah scrolls were written in Hebrew, the language of the Israelites. One reason mainstream scholars doubt that Moses could write the Torah is that they say there was no form of writing like Hebrew in existence at the time of the Exodus. So to establish the possibility that Moses could have written the first books of the Bible, I would have to identify a writing system that Moses could've used that had these components. It would need to exist by the time of the Exodus because that's when the Bible says Moses was living and writing the early books. It would have to be available in the region of Egypt because that is where the Bible places Moses and the Israelites in the centuries before the Exodus. It would need to be a form of writing like Hebrew that Moses could have used to write the Torah because that was the language of the early Israelites. Patterns are powerful tools because they demonstrate a sequence of information. A sequence is much stronger than one random piece of data. I have learned that to find a pattern in history, you would need all the pieces to fit together. One reason there is a debate over whether Moses could have written the Torah is because the original documents have not survived the many centuries down to today. So what are the oldest copies we have and how close are they to the time of Moses? I traveled to the Dead Sea in Israel, where in the 1940s and 50s, the oldest known copies of books from the Bible were discovered. They were called the Dead Sea Scrolls and they were written in Hebrew, the language of the early Israelites. Dr. Randall Price was the director of excavations at Qumran for 10 years. In January of 2017, he was a part of the discovery of a new cave at Qumran; the first new cave in over 60 years. - Here we also found part of a top of a juglet and of a cooking pot, indication this cave was used. They found the remains of jars, placed in niches, but the scrolls had been taken. They hoped to find more caves with new evidence in the years ahead. I asked him about the significance of the Dead Sea Scrolls. - Now with the Dead Sea Scrolls, not only do we have this history brought to life with all these various documents, but we have every copy, every book of the Old Testament except for Esther. But Esther is mentioned in some of the texts, so we know they must've had it represented. We have the oldest copies of the Bible that we know. The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls puts the date at around 200 B.C. for the oldest copies of books from the Bible that have been found. If the story of the Exodus originated earlier than this, the question is how much earlier? If mainstream scholars don't think Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible, when do they think they were written? - My thinking is it was written during the Persian period, which would put it probably at the fifth to fourth centuries B.C. So not back as an eyewitness account. I don't think so; there's no evidence for that. - If the early books of the Bible weren't written until this time, then that's a big problem for the validity of the Bible's claims. A colleague of Professor Peter Gentry is Professor Duane Garrett. He is the distinguished John R. Sampey Professor of Old Testament at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Professor Garrett authored Rethinking Genesis and has written commentaries in other books on the development of the Bible. Do you think that Moses wrote the Torah? - Moses did write it. There are things in the Pentateuch such as the death of Moses. The Pentateuch doesn't claim that Moses wrote his own death. I don't think that's a problem. But if you look at the fact that the laws are crucial and are central to the Pentateuch and that those come from Moses, then certainly it is fair to say that Moses is the author or the source of the Pentateuch. - When I was filming William Dever, he was very adamant that really no one believes that Moses wrote the first books of the Bible. What would you say to that? - When you speak of mainstream scholarship, it depends upon how you define the term. If you define it by a fairly exclusive club of university scholars, basically they're right. But of course, there are plenty of evangelicals who have looked into the issue and continue to hold to Mosaic origin for the Pentateuch. It just depends on how you define the term. In 1979, southwest of the old city of Jerusalem, an archeological team headed by Gabriel Barkay uncovered two tiny scrolls made of silver. They fit into an ancient amulet that was hung around the neck. When the scrolls were carefully unrolled, they revealed Hebrew writing, including a passage from the Book of Numbers. It was the famous blessing Moses gave to the priest. The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you. The Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. The wording exactly matched what is found in modern Bibles. After testing, it was found to be the oldest surviving text of a Biblical passage and it was dated to 600 B.B., which is 400 years earlier than the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran and more than 200 years earlier than when Professor Knight thinks the first Torah was written. So I asked him why he thought Moses couldn't have written the Torah back at the time of the Exodus. - Even though writing was possible, most people were illiterate. Who would have written it and for whom? There is no reading public that's out there waiting for the next installment. It was clear that this issue of when widespread literacy was possible is important. - The context in which this literature first came into existence was in oral traditions that were being passed on from one generation to the next. Stories that you would tell your children. They would then tell their children. These stories are not unchanging as they pass on in time. You embellish, you enhance, you connect. Pretty soon you might end up with a larger saga of materials. These oral traditions really are the seed bed for later on what became written text. - The thinking is that if Moses didn't write at the time of the Exodus, then this part of the Bible and its account of god-given revelation to mankind was an oral tradition and more vulnerable to changes and exaggerations with each telling of the story. If that happened, it would no longer be a trustworthy account. But surely widespread literacy wasn't required for Moses to write the Pentateuch, since scribes in Egypt and ancient Mesopotamia wrote all the time without a large-reading audience. However, as I read the book of Deuteronomy, I saw that a wider literacy was essential for the Israelites to understand and preserve the revelation given to them in the books of Moses. It recorded that Moses told the heads of Israelite households to write the words of the law on the doorposts of their homes and on their gates, so they could teach them to their children. What I know so far is that the Bible is claiming that Moses wrote and that there was literacy among the Israelites. We may never know how widespread it was. But because of the perishable nature of the writing material, it's not surprising that we haven't found much evidence of writing, including books of the Bible from the early part of Israel's history. If Moses wrote the Torah, was there a suitable writing system as early as 1450 BC? I went to Egypt to meet Egyptologist David Rohl. Myth or History, in which he lays out evidence for the Sojourn, Exodus and Conquest at the earlier date. I asked David to help me understand how writing developed in the ancient world. Wow, look at these. These reliefs are absolutely perfect. They're gorgeous, aren't they? Yeah, is it a tomb or a temple writing? - This is actually a chapel above a tomb. The tomb is actually below us down here. But what we're standing in is the chapel above the tomb and it's covered in hieroglyphs. This is the cartouche of the God's Wife, Amenirdis, A-men-irdis. You always read hieroglyphs looking into the animals. You face towards the animal like the snake here and the vulture here so you're reading from left to right in this case and then from top to bottom. - Is this a story, a narrative or what does all this mean? - No, they're spells, incantations and things like that. They mention the person and what she must do to enter the underworld, to pass into that other life. David went onto explain to me that writing actually existed long before the Exodus in forms such as hieroglyphics in Egypt and cuneiform in ancient Mesopotamia, which was in the area of modern day Iraq. But were hieroglyphics or cuneiform a suitable writing system, that Moses could've used to write the Torah? As I thought about it, the writing system also had to be simple enough for the Israelites to read what was written as Moses commanded. Unlike the alphabet, cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphics had nearly 1,000 signs. They were so complicated to learn that only the scribes, priests and kings could use them. In contrast, our alphabet today has 26 letters. Imagine how much harder it would be to have to learn four of our alphabets rather than one. But to learn hieroglyphics, one would have to learn the equivalent of 40 alphabets. That's one thing that made the alphabet so revolutionary. With a simple-to-learn yet powerful alphabet, it would've been possible to teach large numbers of Israelites to read and write. With a non-alphabetic system, this would've been impossible. - In Egyptian scrolls, they had a list of names on a and that sort of thing that went on forever; hundreds and hundreds of things that the kid would have to memorize. But not with an alphabet, you can simply use the 26 signs and that's it. But it was worse than that. Hieroglyphics had symbols for whole words, parts of words and determinatives that were not pronounced but were visual cues for the reader. I could see how these symbols would be hard to learn and hard to use. In contrast, the alphabet was based entirely on the sounds that each letter stood for. Suddenly writing became simple enough for common people to learn and this is how we continue to teach reading and writing today. Cat. - For the writer and the reader, it simplified things greatly. These were entirely phonetic and he could actually take and make his own words. The ornate artwork of hieroglyphs were specially designed to be used on grandiose monuments, not on scrolls. This is another advantage for using an alphabet. - In fact if you're writing something like the book of Exodus or the book of Genesis, it takes less room to write it. If it was tried to be written down with something like hieroglyphics, it would've taken miles of Papyrus to write that particular book. The complex pictograms of hieroglyphs were replaced by the simplified strokes of letters. The genius of the alphabet would revolutionize history. With only a handful of letters, the alphabet was powerful enough to express an infinite number of words; words for every idea on every page of every book found in libraries around the western world from children's books to scientific journals to Bibles. When I examined the relationship between the Bible and the alphabet through history, I saw that no other book in the world was translated into more languages than the books of the Bible. I went to see Hebrew scholar, Brian Rickett. He showed me amazingly complex structures and nuances in the Torah text that would require the power and flexibility of the alphabet. This is an extremely well-written, complex document. It reflects mastery of the language, linguistic mastery. A remarkable uniformity from beginning to end. It reflects sophistication, elegance, artistry. All the kinds of things you might look for in a piece of world-class literature. The Torah itself has it. - Every Torah scroll that has been found was written in a Hebrew alphabet. It was clear that this would require another step to look for in my investigation. If Moses wrote the Torah and just as importantly the Israelites were able to read it, they would've needed the power of an alphabet. The question is was there an alphabet available at the time of the Exodus? I went to George Washington University to see a professor of northwest Semitic languages. I wanted to know more about why mainstream scholars doubt that Moses could've written the early books of the Bible. Professor Christopher Rollston is an expert in the ancient Semitic family of languages; one of which is Hebrew. Do you think that the Hebrews were in Egypt, that there was really the story, the narrative of the Bible that places them there? - I believe that there was an Exodus, but I think the narratives grew through time to become stories almost if from Homeric proportions. - Homeric meaning Homer? - Yes, indeed. - Okay, alright. A meaning that there was some exaggeration? - That's a term we could use. I'm a practical person and ultimately, I know just as you do that stories are told and retold and told again. Sometimes the stories grow and the details change through the telling in different times in different places. The narratives in the Bible I find to be beautiful, the narratives about the Exodus. But the details, I think, are not always so precise. But if it's not accurate, can I really trust it? Is there a god who saves the oppressed or is this more or less a fairytale? Some say more and some say less. When does an evidence for the earliest keeper alphabet or script first appear? - We know the Hebrew scripture very well begins about 900 BCE and it's very distinctive; it's different from Venetian, it developed from Venetian. The Hebrew script is a distinctive script and we know it well from hundreds and hundreds of inscriptions. - If the Hebrew script wasn't available until 900 BC, some see this as a big problem for Moses writing the first books of the Bible at the time of the Exodus. This is the first step of the pattern that I'm looking for. What could be the answer to this problem? Do you think that it was an earlier form of it? A Hebrew form that Moses could have used that evolved over time? - The problem... The script certainly evolved during the course of time, but its evolution begins around 900 BCE. - We don't know what he wrote and he would have written in Egyptian probably if he had written, not Hebrew. - The logic makes sense. In the standard view, there's no Hebrew alphabet available at the time of the Exodus. So Moses couldn't write the early books of the Bible. If that's the case, can the Bible's accounts, God acting in history, really be trusted? For example, when the Book of Exodus says that the sea miraculously parted and the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. Was that something Moses actually saw with his own eyes? Or was it just the invention of somebody writing centuries later? These thoughts were troubling to me. The reason I cared so much goes back to how I was raised. My parents' marriage broke up when I was really young. It was extremely painful. Being the eldest of four siblings, I had the responsibility to watch my brother and sisters 'cause my mom couldn't be there all the time. So when we went to the park or we went sliding, I was on duty. That's what happens when your folks break up. You end up becoming, if you're the eldest, sort of responsible. I became the man of the house. My mother, as a single parent, would read Bible stories to us every night before we went to bed. She put a lot of faith into the idea that they were true. She believed that if God helped people in the past, he could help her make it as a single parent with four kids. It was very important to her. The Bible gave her hope. She wanted it to be important to her family as well. Growing up hearing these stories from the Bible, I'd always assumed they really happened. They really intrigued me. But the question is did I believe this just because it was the way I was raised? If I'd been raised in another part of the world, wouldn't I have believed something altogether different? Did I believe the Bible because it was true or because it's just what we believed? While visiting Brian Rickett, I asked him how emphatic the Bible's claims are for Moses writing its first books around the time of the Exodus. - Exodus 17:14. It says the Lord said to Moses, "Write in a book. "Write this in a book," then it goes on. When Moses produces the tablets, God tells him to do that too. We have references in the Torah and all throughout the Bible that describe Mosaic authorship to the texts and it claims for itself that it is the product of Moses' writing as a result of what God told him to do. - I remembered that almost all of the books of the Bible reference back to the writings of Moses. Jesus talks about Moses and references Moses. If Moses didn't exist, then what does that do to really the credibility of Jesus? - Yes, John 5 provides five witnesses to Jesus' divinity. He concludes his argument by saying this in John 5. "If you believed Moses, you would believe me; "for he wrote of me. "But if you do not believe his writings, "how will you believe my words?" So there it looks like you have a definitive statement from Jesus that Moses produced the Torah and he's staking an awful lot on that reality. - What Moses himself says that these things were given to him by God. God told me. God spoke to me. God commanded this. - He clearly says that what he is writing is what God revealed. On the other hand, we see that he undoubtedly had sources. Moses didn't live in a vacuum. The traditions and things, whether passed on orally or in writing, were given to him probably by the Israelites in Egypt; part of the history he was given. This formed part of the basis on which he wrote. The rest revealed by God. - If the Bible's claims are true, then Moses must have been at least the primary person responsible for writing major parts of the Torah, which is the common assumption of early Judaism and of Jesus and his followers in the New Testament. Once again, Moses would have needed a form of writing like Hebrew by 1450 BC. Yet this is exactly what most scholars say doesn't exist. I was raised in a home that took the Bible literally, and you probably-- - I was too. - Yeah, so the question is is the Bible a literal story of God acting in history? - It purports to be. But whether it is or not is a question of belief. That's not something that can be proven. Proven is a hard task; but I'm just asking if there's good reasons to believe it. The text is claiming not only that Moses wrote these things, but that God inspired the very words that were written. But if as some scholars are suggesting, there are parts in the Bible that are true and others that are not, how could you ever know which parts to trust? Believing in the God of the Bible, has been the foundation for my own family for generations. But what does that faith mean if it's based on a mixture of real history along with legends and fairytales? That thought left me very unsettled. I knew that if I was going to deal with this skepticism concerning the Bible's integrity and not live in a conflicted way, I would need answers. I couldn't give up. I would have to continue with the original question: Is there any evidence outside the Bible demonstrating that Moses could have written the Torah? According to the Torah, this is an eye witness account of Moses bringing the Israelites out of Egypt to Mount Sinai to meet with God. - It's an amazing experience that we can't even imagine. But look at what happens. God comes down to Mount Sinai. The people are expecting this. They were told before they left Egypt, Come, God is waiting for us at Mount Sinai. He's got something to tell us. On the morning of the third day, there was thunder and lightening, a thick cloud on the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. So that all the people in the camp trembled. Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the Lord had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of and the whole mountain trembled greatly. As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him in thunder. - If you think of it, Sinai is truly awesome. Os Guinness is an author and social critic. I met him at his office surrounded by the signed photos of some of his writing heroes. He had researched a number of significant features having to do with the events at Mount Sinai. - At the heart of Sinai, not just the Great Constitution, the Covenant. Not just the great liberation coming out of Egypt, but the heart of them all is the Great Revelation, whether it's the Lord revealing himself to Moses alone at the burning bush or the Lord revealing himself to the entire nation in chapter 19. Many people don't realize how extraordinary that is. You take atheism. It's humans figuring it all out. You take Buddhism. It's humans figuring it all out. The great difference in the scriptures, it's not the ascent of humans through their thinking to God, if there is a God; it's the descent, the Revelation, the disclosure of God to us. That's what's unique about Sinai and the Jewish and Christian scriptures. - Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord and all the laws. All the people answered with one voice and said all the words that the Lord has spoken we will do. Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord. - After 3300 years, an important discovery shed light on Moses's ability to write the Torah. In 1905, the great pioneer of archeology, Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, and his wife, Hilda, went to the Sinai Peninsula searching for evidence of ancient Egyptian activity. Petrie had already found the famous Merneptah Stele, near Thebes. At the time, it contained the oldest known reference to the people of Israel. It boasted that they had been subdued by the Pharaohs. Just 50 miles north west of the traditional Mount Sinai, ancient Egypt worked major copper and turquoise mines. One of these sites is known today as Serabit El-Khadim. The Petries began to discover many hieroglyphic inscriptions; then on the walls of one of the mines, they saw writing that appeared different from the rest. To learn more about Petrie and his discovery, I went to the Petrie museum at University College, London. Egyptologist Chris Naunton is the former director of the Egypt Exploration Society and the current president of the International Association of Egyptologists. What was unique about Flanders? - Petrie has a far more rigorous scientific approach to the material that he was excavating really than anyone had before. Previously, archeologists had been drawn to, treasure is probably as good a word, objects which were very beautiful. Museum quality was a phrase that was often used. Those things were prioritized. More or less, everything else, the non beautiful, non inscribed, disregarded. Petrie is the first person really to realize that there was a huge amount to be learned from those things. He is the man to invent techniques for gathering that material, documenting it, and interpreting it. Let's just talk about inscriptions that he found in Sinai. - Petrie's work in the Sinai is incredibly important. He uncovered a group of inscribed objects inscribed with a script which was unknown elsewhere in Egypt. This is the Proto-Sinaitic script. Of course, textural material which Petrie and others were uncovering in Egypt was abundant, but written in scripts which we're very familiar with. This was something very different. - Wasn't Egyptian. - Not Egyptian. This was a new script, a new language. Something that would have very much sat outside what was well established as something Egyptologists knew about in that valley. - In 1999, more inscriptions were found by Egyptologists John and Deborah Darnell. This time in Egypt, northwest of the ancient city of Thebes at a place called Wadi El-Hol. They were in the same style as those found in the Sinai. What date were the inscriptions at the Sinai mines and how do we know? - Both the inscriptions from Serabit El-Khadim and those from Wadi El-Hol are in essence argued to be Middle Kingdom. One of the reasons we do that is because, for example, at Wadi El-Hol, the inscriptions that are closest are actually Middle Kingdom texts and the same is true for the Serabit inscriptions. - In the search for a pattern of evidence, what I know so far is that the Petries and others discovered a new type of script. It developed during the Middle Kingdom, so it would have existed by the time of the Exodus and should have been available to Moses. This script was found in the region of Egypt. It was not Egyptian hieroglyphs; it was something very different. These finds match the first two criteria of the investigation. But what about the last two? Could this new writing be a type of alphabet and like Hebrew? The Sinai mining district where the Petries had discovered this unusual script was off limits to filming due to ISIS activity in the area. I recreated the setting and asked Egyptologist David Rohl to join me and explain the significance of the inscriptions that the Petries had found. - They couldn't read it 'cause it looks like Egyptian hieroglyphs; but when you read it, it doesn't actually become Egyptian. It's something quite different. So they brought an expert along later on to read it and it turned out to be what we call Northwest Semitic. - How do you read something like this? - This inscription here you see coming down, vertical column. Then the other one going along in this direction. So it's like a letter L. But it's two separate inscriptions. The first one is really important. The second one is the message to say please read the first one. To learn more about these inscriptions, I traveled to Oxford, England, home to the oldest university in the English-speaking world. The Griffith Institute holds the handwritten archives of the man responsible for identifying the source of these inscriptions. His name was Sir Alan Gardiner and he was one of the world's pre-eminent experts in ancient languages. He determined that not only was this script made by Semitic people; it was made up of individual letters that formed the world's oldest known alphabet. The case for the alphabetic character of the unknown script is overwhelming. The meanings of these names, translated as Semitic words, are plain or plausible in 17 cases. - There are several languages in the Northwest Semitic family; one of which is the Hebrew spoken by the Israelites. All of them are very similar. Since they are all so similar, some scholars have suggested that Moses didn't actually need a Hebrew alphabet. He could have used one of the other Semitic scripts to write the Torah. The writing could later have transitioned to Hebrew around 900 BC when the Hebrew script developed. This early alphabetic script has been given several names by scholars. One is Proto-Sinaitic. Proto meaning first and Sinaitic meaning from the Sinai. Another is Proto-Canaanite because it later shows up in the land of Canaan. Did those inscriptions give you an idea of the types of people that were scratching on these walls? - They were definitely Semites. We know that because of the words that they wrote. Many of them can be deciphered and have been deciphered. Those are Semitic words. - It seemed this was just what I was looking for. But one challenge against Moses writing the Torah is the common view that the Phoenicians, who lived next to the land of Israel, invented the alphabet around 1100 BC, long after the time of Moses and the Exodus. If this were true, it would mean that there was no alphabet for Moses to use. The Petries' discovery of this early Semitic alphabet, now dated by scholars to the era of the Middle Kingdom, clearly challenges that claim. For many years, the popular claim in school textbooks has been that the Phoenicians basically invented the alphabet. What's your thoughts? - In essence, I think what we can say based on the evidence that we have is the Phoenicians didn't invent the alphabet. We certainly know that's the case. The Phoenicians didn't invent the alphabet. The Phoenicians did though standardize the early alphabetic writing system; but the alphabet itself was an innovation and it was definitely Semites who invented it. This would mean that the world's oldest alphabet is not Phoenician, but is actually the Proto-Sinaitic script found by the Petries. - What the evidence suggests is that we have wonderful Northwest Semitic inscriptions., evidence for the Semites inventing the alphabet. Evidence for the first alphabet, a grand of technology that will from that point on transform so many things. - Transforms the world. - We use it today. - I am asking the questions from my own faith. I wanna know if Moses wrote. - It's not just a matter of historical curiosity. Well Moses wrote these books and not some anonymous figure. It is that Moses is the chosen man of God. He is the man who spoke God as a man speaks to his friend. Moses has great authority. That is why I think Jesus and the apostles when they spoke of the books of Moses, they refer to him by name because he was Moses. He was this chosen man of God. - In my search for a pattern of evidence showing that Moses could have written the first books of the Bible, the inscriptions found by the Petries and others confirm that the Proto-Sinaitic script is the earliest known alphabet and it appeared centuries earlier than even Phoenician. An alphabet would make learning to read and write easy, allowing the Israelites to teach their children the words of God as Moses instructed. This alphabet was Semitic, which means that it was in the same family as Hebrew. Therefore, it was a form of writing like Hebrew. This writing existing by the time of the Exodus and in the region of Egypt could have provided the tool needed for Moses to express the nuance and detail found in the early books of the Bible. I was excited to actually find evidence matching all four steps of the criteria. But this brings up a new question about the fourth step of the pattern; an even bigger and more profound question that goes beyond whether it was like Hebrew. What if these inscriptions weren't just like Hebrew? What if they actually were Hebrew? If that were true, it would be a slam dunk for Moses' ability to write the Torah in Hebrew, the language of all known Torah scrolls. Not only that, if it was Hebrew, it would show that the source of the script was the Israelites. I couldn't get this idea out of my head. Was this script actually the earliest written Hebrew? As I set off to investigate, little did I realize how controversial that question would be. Could this script actually be the earliest form of written Hebrew? This might seems like a logical question, but I was very puzzled to find just how controversial this idea is in the world of academia today. I went to Israel to meet with the chair of Egyptology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Professor Orly Goldwasser is one of Israel's leading experts on the formation of the early alphabet. There are some people suggesting that this Proto-Sinaitic script was early form of Hebrew. Have you ever heard that before? - Yeah, yeah, this is sad. - Sad? This is sad? - It's not science. This is, excuse me for using the very blunt words here. This is disseminating fake knowledge and fake science to people. It's not their field. You can tell me for example, any stories in biology, mathematics and I will believe because I don't know. Really if my great teacher Joseph Naveh would be alive, I think he would die again if he moved here. - You could hear that? - He invented this theory. It has nothing to do. Hebrew is a kind of dialect that developed Canaanite dialect. It developed much later. To call this old Canaanite dialect which cannot be identified, maybe because the inscriptions are too short. Hebrew, it's opportunism. Professor Gentry experienced something different with his professors. - Frequently when we're taught things, there's a consensus among scholars that this is the way things are. But when you get out the microscope and examine the evidence, sometimes it doesn't add up so it's important to check things out. - Yeah 'cause I know a lot of people can say my professor told me. - Yeah, that's right. - Then his professor told him, correct? - That's right. - Then there's the real question of is it correct? - That's right. - What would be one example of a problem you had that through diligence and investigation, you were able to solve for yourself? - I think the documentary hypothesis is one. I went to a school where they taught it every day for 17 years. I read a book by an Italian Jew called Umberto Cassuto. He wrote a very good book criticizing the documentary hypothesis. One day I was at the University of Toronto and my professor was teaching the documentary hypothesis. All I did was very politely say, "Have you ever looked at the book by Umberto Cassuto?" The answer I was given was, "We don't read books like that around here." That was when I clued in and realized for them it's a faith stance. It's not as if this is perfect science. - In other words, there was a sense that they didn't wanna hear other information. - That's right. For me, they were the fundamentalists because their minds were closed and they were not interested in evidence that would call their consensus into question. - The issue of this script being Hebrew directly connects to whether Moses could've used it to write the Torah. If one believes that Moses didn't write the Torah, then where does that thinking naturally lead? We both grew up in families that both believed the Bible was a historical document. - My father was a minister, very conservative, southern, small-town churches. - Tell me about that. You were raised in a conservative home. - We read the Bible literally and thought that was adequate. Then I went to a Bible college and nothing changed there. Then I went to a liberal/protestant theological seminary and that was quite a shock I remember. Then I went onto Harvard and by that time, I was moving away from theology and into history, thus into archeology. - You were actually a minister. - I was a clergyman for 13 years, United Church of Christ. - I'm gonna ask you a theological question 'cause you have had quite an arc of a life. - I've had an adventuresome life. - You have, you have. I'm gonna ask you the most obvious question, is there a god? - I am not an atheist. I think that's an arrogant position. I'm an agnostic, which means I do not know and I think that's the only honest position I can take. I'm not going to say there is or there is not, that's a theological issue. I'm not a theologian. - In these interviews it was clear to me that the more these scholars doubted that Moses wrote the Torah, the less sure they were of even the existence of God. I remember going to church on Sunday mornings and hearing the Bible called the Word of God. I was taught that Moses and other Biblical writers were divinely inspired. They were chosen people who wrote what they saw and heard from God, so others in the future could read it. Was there a connection between the Bible and the world's first alphabet? Early in his career, David Rohl had uncovered problems with the dates given to the reigns of Egyptian Pharaohs. He concluded that Egypt's dating had been over-exaggerated and needed to be revised. When this was done, he began to see evidence for the Biblical Exodus emerging in an entirely new period. While most scholars put the six steps of the Exodus in Egypt's New Kingdom, this evidence was in the earlier middle kingdom at a time where most weren't looking. The unexpected result of David's revision of Egyptian history was that the early evidence shifted forward aligning with the Biblical dates. To further explore his theories, he traveled into the Sinai area were the Petries made their discoveries. He had quickly come to realize that placing the early Israelites in the Middle Kingdom could connect them and their Hebrew language with the Proto-Sinaitic script, which was invented in the same time period and in the same area. But the idea of Moses writing the Torah and a Biblical Exodus is inconceivable to most scholars. Yet I had been faced with this challenge before and the solution was found in a pattern. In the search for whether the Sinai inscriptions were actually written in an early form of Hebrew, I would need to answer the following three questions. Do the letters of the Proto-Sinaitic script match the look of Hebrew? Is there a connection and are the inscriptions readable as Hebrew, do they make sense? Does the history of the early alphabet match the history of the Israelites? Because if it does, it would indicate they were the ones responsible for it. The first question of the Hebrew pattern is do the letters of the Proto-Sinaitic script match the look of Hebrew? Dr. Douglas Petrovich has long studied inscriptions and their meanings. He is yet another scholar I met who believes Moses wrote the Torah. It appears that Professor Dever's claim that scholars no longer hold this view was overstated. Just like David Rohl, Dr. Petrovich proposes that the early Sinaitic script is actually the earliest form of written Hebrew developed by the Israelites. However unlike Rohl, Petrovich doesn't see a problem with Egypt's dating system, so he uses the standard dates. Petrovich recently outlined his case in his book, The World's Oldest Alphabet. He thinks a key link between the Sinai inscriptions and the early Israelites is the fact that whoever invented the alphabet borrowed symbols from Egyptian hieroglyphs to make the letters. Here's the Egyptian gallery and we have an artifact here. Tell me about this. - That's right, this is from ancient Egypt. It's from the Old Kingdom, maybe about 400 years before Abraham lived. - It's very old then. - It's very old. - What is the connection with Egyptian hieroglyphs and the oldest alphabet? - This is the very writing script that's the basis of the world's oldest alphabet. They were formed from 22 of these hieroglyphic signs. - Are there any of those examples here on this? - Yes, in fact here is a wave of water. When you convert this into a proto-continental alphabetical letter in Hebrew, this becomes the M because for Hebrews, water is mayim. They see the wave of water, they're thinking mayim and they pronounce muh. - This is were the alphabet came from, but how did it develop over time? When you look at the family tree for the beginning of the alphabet, it starts with the Proto-Sinaitic script which when found in Canaan is called Proto-Canaanite. Then in the standard view, the alphabet is believed to have developed into Phoenician hundreds of years later. In this view, Phoenician branches into other scripts such as Old Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek continuing on to numerous alphabets over the centuries. But was the first alphabet related to Hebrew? Professor Petrovich has argued that the Proto-Siniatic inscriptions were actually an early form of Hebrew and the world's first alphabet. What are your thoughts? - I wish that it were true. I wish that were correct. It would be absolutely fascinating. The difficulty with that is first and foremost the script of the Proto-Canaanite inscriptions or the early alphabetic inscriptions; the script is definitely not the Hebrew script, so that's a problem. - I could see why it's difficult to link Old Hebrew with the world's oldest alphabet, the Proto-Sinaitic script. Old Hebrew or Paleo Hebrew, as it's sometimes called, is thought to have emerged 1,000 years later and to have developed from Phoenician. The consensus of scholars holds that the very first Hebrew text starts with Old Hebrew by definition. - We know the Hebrew inscriptions well. We know the Hebrew script well beginning around 900 BCE. The script of those inscriptions is dramatically different from the Hebrew script, dramatically different. However, scripts can look dramatically different and still be a part of the same family. One example can be seen by looking at the first verse in the book of Genesis as seen in the Wycliffe Bible. It was written in the English of 1385 from about 600 years ago. Here is the same verse today. I was surprised how much English has changed. Furthermore, even Professor Rollston acknowledged that the Hebrew script changed over time in a later period. But if Old Hebrew evolved over time, why couldn't it have evolved earlier from the script that is known today as Proto-Sinaitic. I needed to go back to Israel and to the important Biblical city of Gezer, 20 miles northwest of Jerusalem. It was here that Irish archeologist Stuart McAllister discovered what many considered to be one of the earliest Old Hebrew inscriptions found to date. It was a calendar inscribed on a limestone tablet that included monthly information about crops. I looked at the Gezer calendar to compare it to the inscriptions the Petries discovered in the Sinai mines which are from centuries earlier. For many of the letters, you can see a clear resemblance. Some of the letters of the two scripts are also different. But according to Doug Petrovich, they aren't as different as Professor Rollston claims. He showed me how each letter changed over time starting with the fifth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, the letter. - It starts out as a full man here, here and here. Usually he has both arms up with right angles at his elbows in a pose that we who live in the United States would call the Touchdown Pose. This is the touchdown letter. This letter makes the H sound in Hebrew like huh and it comes from the Hebrew world halal. That's the word that's connected to the pictograph. Halal means praise. - Or hallelujah? - The word hallelujah is based on this very word. It's the arms raised in praise toward God. The head is insignificant, the legs are insignificant. Oddly enough, what happens over time as the letter evolves? Here's one leg missing. Here's a head that's been reduced greatly. Reduced greatly, reduced greatly. No legs at all here on Sinai 374, why? Because all you need is the hands raised. Eventually they realized we don't really need the head and we don't really need the legs, so that morphs into what looks like an E. If you were to take this from the Sartah Ostracon and turn it 90 degrees to the left, it would be the neck of a person, the left arm of a person and the right arm of a person all pointing up. - While the Proto-Sinaitic letter of a man praising may look quite different than the corresponding Hebrew letter, once you understand how it developed, you can see how they relate. David Rohl also showed me how this development happened with our modern letter A. - I'll give you a good example. The bull's head, Aleph. It starts life as an ordinary drawing of a bull with two horns. As it comes through Proto-Canaanite into Phoenician, it turns to that shape at right angles from the original bull and it's now become lines rather than a very careful drawing, it's very angularized. Then it comes into Greek and to our English language like this. It's rotating and it's changing its shape, but you can still see the original bull's head, in the letter A but it's now upside down. But can these two related scripts be considered different versions of Hebrew? It appears that Phoenician is the one thing standing in the way of making that link. How dramatic are the differences between Old Hebrew and Phoenician? When compared to Phoenician, the character of the letters looks very similar to the Old Hebrew found by Stuart McAllister to the point where most of the letters are basically identical. It could almost boil down to individual styles of handwriting. Israel's preeminent authority on ancient inscriptions was the late Joseph Naveh. Dr. Goldwasser was one of Naveh's students. - He was the great expert of the script. - 'Cause I wanna find out what the truth is 'cause I've interviewed some people who are saying they think there's a link. I know that Joseph Naveh, he said something. He wrote, "In inscriptions of the 10th century." - 10th century, remember the 10th. In inscriptions of the 10th century, Phoenician, Hebrew and Aramaic scripts are indistinguishable. - If Old Hebrew, Aramaic and Phoenician were indistinguishable in the 10th century, is it really proper to call the script Phoenician at that time? According to Naveh, it's only later that this script branches into the more distinct versions. In that case, the actual model for the early alphabet would look more like this with this mystery script being the predecessor of the other three. Today, some call this mystery script early Phoenician. Others call it a late form of Proto-Canaanite, but could it actually be an early form of Hebrew? To be clear, Joseph Naveh held to the same standard view as professors Rollston and Goldwasser, that we can't call the early phase of this script Hebrew because Old Hebrew did not become a distinct script until after the 10th century BC. - This is worse for your theory because Naveh believes the Hebrew was born even later. - Okay, what is called Old Hebrew came later. But the question remains, what really was this mystery script? Professor Naveh did an extensive study of six letters from this script as it evolved into Phoenician, Old Hebrew and Aramaic. Surprisingly he said that over time, "The Hebrew script preserved the basic forms of the letters "to a greater extent than the other two." Now that is curious. Why would Old Hebrew be the one to maintain the characteristics of the mystery script better than the others? Naveh believed it was because the Israelites were isolated in a mountainous land steeped in tradition, so they didn't change things. But if Old Hebrew is the most similar to the mystery script, maybe it's because both were forms of Hebrew. Based on the thinking of scholars like Petrovich and Rohl, this opens up the possibility that Proto-Sinaitic was merely Hebrew 1.0 as the earliest form of written Hebrew that later developed into Hebrew 2.0, the mystery script. It was then picked up by Israel's neighbors, the Phoenicians, before spreading throughout the region. It would later develop into Old Hebrew or Hebrew 3.0. Interesting though, the idea that some form of Hebrew writing came first is supported by one of the earliest Jewish historians. Eupolemus around 150 BC wrote in his book titled On the Kings of Judea. Moses was the first wise man and the first that imparted grammar to the Jews. The Phoenicians received it from the Jews and the Greeks from the Phoenicians. - For Rohl and Petrovich, Moses was the wise man who had the ability to write the book of Exodus as an eyewitness account. When investigating the first step, does Proto-Sinaitic match the look of Hebrew? I discovered that there are many letters in Proto-Sinaitic that closely resemble those of the mystery script in Old Hebrew. The development of those letters that aren't different can be traced in a logical way showing that these scripts are related. Over time as the script transition to the distinct Phoenician, Aramaic and Old Hebrew styles, it was the Old Hebrew that maintained the style of the mystery script better than the others. This supports the idea that the original Proto-Sinaitic was Hebrew 1.0, which then evolved into Hebrew 2.0 and 3.0. I can now move on to the second step of the pattern investigating whether the inscriptions are readable as Hebrew, an idea that is extremely controversial. Rollston says that the words found in the inscriptions are not specific to Hebrew, but are common to all Semitic languages. - In other words, it's not evidence for those texts being Hebrew. It's evidence for those texts being Semitic and that's all that we can say. - But if all the Semitic languages are so similar, then doesn't that also mean that we can't really say that it isn't Hebrew? Obviously, some Semitic group invented the first alphabet and why not the Israelites? For more than 100 years, other scholars have suspected the Hebrew connection, but their ideas never took hold. - In the wall. - David Rohl has worked with the Sinai inscriptions and disagrees with Rollston's position. He believes they can be read as uniquely Hebrew. Rohl used recognized letter identifications made by previous scholars for the signs. He then sent those letter interpretations to Rabbi Michael Shelomo Bar-Ron in Jerusalem to see if the inscriptions could be read as Biblical Hebrew. - One day David Rohl just sends me an email with a string of letter names. I scratch out this string of letters in the modern human characters that we make use of. I look at it for a minute and I clearly make out what the word roots are; I'm blown away. I can read it. In other words this is not the northwest Semitic that you're talking about, this is the Hebrew of our ancestors. This etching, this inscription somewhere in the Sinai Desert is actual plain Biblical Hebrew. - What were some of the things that were written there? - There are things like instructions, how to use mana. In the Bible there's a big thing about you mustn't store it. You have to eat it when it's given to you. This thing says pay attention to the way you use mana. Follow the Father and his instructions. Dr. Petrovich also agrees that these inscriptions are an early form of Hebrew. However, he has arrived at different interpretations than David Rohl. Petrovich identifies words and names he believes are uniquely Hebrew, as well as Biblical characters. One such character had a son who participated in the building of the tabernacle at Mount Sinai. In another inscription from the minds of Serabit el-Khadim he even reads the name Moses. What makes interpreting these inscriptions so difficult is that there are only consonants, no vowels. Many of them have no spaces between words. They can be written either left to right or right to left. The true identification of several of the letters are disputed and many are damaged, making them hard to read. That is why many scholars state, "We can't read these inscriptions as Hebrew." - Someone's attempt to state that they can not only read these inscriptions, but read names that we know from the Bible or positive that we have people present in these inscriptions from the Bible. It's a difficult thing indeed. You have to have evidence for these proposals and it's just not there. - Some of my critics such as Christopher Rollston are saying that this could be any Semitic language. There's no way of identifying as clearly being Hebrew. There are several distinctively Hebrew words that are not found in any other Semitic language that are contained in the 15 Hebrew inscriptions I've translated. The key to Petrovich's approach was to test different letter identifications for those Proto-Sinaitic letters that are disputed. - I was able to try the different options of what all the scholars have been proposing for 100 years or so. Through that process, I was able to answer which were correct. Because in certain contexts, if you took it one way, it wouldn't work. If you took it another way, it definitely worked. In fact, it always worked. - When Rohl and Petrovich assigned equivalent Hebrew letters to these inscriptions, they claim they make sense when read as Hebrew. They state they are finding uniquely-Hebrew words. They also claim that some of the inscriptions reference Biblical characters and events. What complicates this issue is that there are different approaches in reading the letters produce different interpretations. But the end of the day, it's encouraging that there are at least two possibilities that result in meaningful phrases for these inscriptions when Hebrew letters are applied. What these inscriptions might say is something I will continue to investigate in future films. People such as Professor Rollston say that it can't be Hebrew because the Hebrew writing didn't exist until much later in time. - That's true. He calls this language northwest Semitic. These scriptures are northwest Semitic. But I say it's a matter of history, not so much of language. You could interpret them as Hebrew only if you have the history to back it up. - Because we have a script that looks similar to Hebrew, yet has some uncertainties with the interpretations, the final step becomes the key to determining which Semitic group invented it. Does the history of the early alphabet match the history of the Israelites? The hieroglyphic roots of the first alphabet along with the locations of the inscriptions point to Egypt being the source. Most scholars believe that this first alphabet developed outta the elite class of scribes who would've been familiar with using Egyptian hieroglyphs. But Professor Goldwasser has a different idea. Your theory is that common people invented the alphabet. - Yeah, my theory is that I take this great invention that change history from the intelligence of the old world to the so-called simple people and say my inventor or inventors were just people that were illiterate in any script. This gave them the freedom to invent, you see, because their mind was free. Nothing was told them you should do this with this picture and that with the other pic; they could prepare a new theory. People hate it. The scholars today even hate it. - They hate it? - Yeah. - How dare they. - They still write against me. It's impossible that simple people invented this very complex, phonetical. It's common sense. It's fantastic common sense. - Everyone agrees that whether they were elite or from the common class, whoever invented this Semitic alphabet had to have been a genius. But who would've had the motive to write their Semitic language in this unique script? - The book of Genesis tells us that the first descendant of Abraham to arrive in Egypt was his great-grandson Joseph, the son of Jacob. Joseph's brothers had sold him as a slave to a caravan of traders, who brought him down to Egypt. With God's help, Joseph was able to save Egypt by warning of a coming calamity. Seven years of plenty would be followed by seven years of terrible famine. Pharaoh was so impressed that he puts Joseph in charge of preparing for the famine and makes him second in command over the entire country. "Since God has shown you all this, "there is none so discerning and wise as you are." - Joseph was an administrator over all of Egypt, a position that would have required him to read and write hieroglyphics. Could your distant relatives, the Israelites or let's say Joseph, could they have been involved with any of this writing? - I can write another story about somebody called-- - Benny. - Benny, who was also in Egypt and he was also very clever. He sold the hieroglyphs. He might have invented the alphabet. This is endless, you see. First of all, it's a little too late already. Then how come the inscriptions in earlier? It's not your time of Joseph or Benny or whoever it could be. - Whoever, yeah. Professor Goldwasser is assuming that these inscriptions are earlier than the time of Joseph because she holds to the standard view of the Ramesses Exodus. However, my previous investigation had uncovered impressive archeological finds matching Joseph and his family in the Middle Kingdom. These all came from a location called Avaris, the city beneath Ramesses, where the Bible places the early Israelites. It was David Rohl who had first come up with these connections. Joseph saved the country from a terrible famine, enables his father Jacob and his entire family to settle in the best part of the land, a place called Goshen. - Is there any indication of famines in Egypt? - Of course there is, in many different periods. But there's one key period when we get this massive famine which lasts about seven to 10 years. It's the time of the end of the 12th dynasty in the reign of Amenemhat III; he's the Pharaoh of this big famine. The reign of Amenemhat III exactly matches the time of Joseph in the early pattern. It was amazing to see how specific the connection was between Amenemhat, Joseph and the dates of the two oldest alphabetic inscriptions in Sinai. - This is the image of the oldest fully Hebrew inscription. There are the letters, here they are drawn in. Here's another image showing you Sinai 377 here in the form of a stellaform. It's like a tombstone; it's rounded at the top and goes down straight on either side. It's intricately connected to another inscription. This is Sinai 46 to its left. - Are these both? In other words, this is one inscription and this is a second one on the same rock face? - On the same rock face. We have Sinai 377 and Sinai 46. Sinai 377 being in Hebrew very short, very trite inscription. Sinai 46, middle Egyptian inscription with the year date at the top. Then it reads right to left in these two rows, then in all of these columns goin' down. The date on here is year 20 of Amenemhat III. 840 BC, 12th dynasty. That connects these two inscriptions in time. - To the time of Joseph and his family. - Yes, the time of Joseph. What this indicates is that the five oldest alphabetic inscriptions that can be dated all emerge in the Middle Kingdom during the reign of Amenemhat III in a narrow 11 year window exactly where the pattern that David Rohl identified places Joseph and his family. Who do you think actually was the inspiration for this alphabet? - I think it has to be Joseph. That would be my guess because of what he was. He was the of Egypt. He was the most important man in Egypt after the Pharaoh. He was educated, he worked in the palace. He was running the country virtually, so what better person to invent the Hebrew alphabet than the person who was familiar with the hieroglyphs, who knew the Semite people, who was administering the land? He's the the guy who's most likely to be able to come up with this idea. - So who invented the first alphabet? His scholars suggest it may have been an elite scribe or a common miner like Benny. But whoever it was, they would've needed to be a Semite familiar with hieroglyphics, motivated to create a new script while living in Egypt at the same time as Pharaoh, Amenemhat III and Joseph. - If Joseph for instance was the person who invented this method of writing the Semitic language as a script, Moses would've learnt not very easily and that would've been the form of writing he would use to write the narrative of the Exodus oourney. - With Moses' background as both Prince of Egypt and an Israelite, he would've most likely known about the Proto-Sinaitic script that the Petries later discovered. But there's another piece of information that both Rohl and Petrovich see connecting the history of the Proto-Sinaitic script and the history of the Israelites. They note that these types of inscriptions end in Egypt around the time of the Exodus and are never seen there again. However, inscriptions in the Proto-Sinaitic style do show up afterwards in Canaan; that is why one of the names of the script is Proto-Canaanite. This just happens to match the Bible's account of the Israelites who grew into a nation in Egypt and later moved to Canaan, conquering the Promised Land. - Supporting the idea that the mystery script is actually Hebrew and not Phoenician is the fact that when the inscriptions first show up in the area of Canaan, they are actually found in Israel for several hundred years before showing up in Phoenicia. The Bible records that the greatest interaction between Israel and Phoenicia, which is the area of Lebanon, was during the rain of King Solomon in the 10th century BC. Solomon was given the responsibility of building Israel's first temple in Jerusalem. To help with this task, Solomon wrote to King Hiram obtaining cedar trees of Lebanon and craftsmen. Intriguingly the oldest known alphabetic inscription from the land of Phoenicia is found on the lid of a sarcophagus named Ahiram. Many date this artifact to the 10th century BC. I took note that the Bible's King Hiram at the time of Solomon is virtually the same name as Ahiram on the sarcophagus. Could it be that the writing system of the Israelites was shared with Phoenicians at this very time when the scripts were indistinguishable and we find the first inscriptions in Phoenician. Just as Eupolemus has stated that "Moses imparted grammar to the Jews" and that "the Phoenicians received it from the Jews." When looking at the final step for whether these inscriptions could be Hebrew, the history of this script does match the history of the Israelites, but only if you use the earlier Exodus date. The inventor of the script was a Semitic genius who was familiar with Egyptian hieroglyphs matching the Bible's account of Joseph's rise to power in Egypt. This script first shows up in a very narrow window of time during the reign of Amenemhat III, exactly where the early pattern puts Joseph and his family. The script migrates to Canaan, matching the Israelites' journey to the promised land. The first inscriptions are found in Ancient Israel, not Phoenicia and curiously, the first inscriptions to show up in Phoenicia are found on the sarcophagus of the king called Ahiram at the time of Solomon. If one considers that the Bible might actually be giving a true account, can there be any better candidates for the ones responsible for this script than the early Israelites? They would have had the motive and ability to develop it in time to write the first books of the Bible. So when people see a connection between the Proto-Sinaitic or the Proto-Canaanite scripts and Hebrew, what do you say? - I say that what I call science and what my teacher taught me-- - Professor Naveh? - Naveh would say that it's a very bad misleading mistake and that the person that writes it has of course an agenda. - On the surface, mainstream scholars use linguistic arguments to dismiss this idea. But there may be a deeper reason involved. What time do you think that the Exodus would have happened? - Most people put the Exodus in the 13th Century BCE from my perspective based on the data at hand. This continues to be the most convincing proposal. - If you want to believe in historical Moses, he would have to have lived in the 13th Century. Whatever it was that happened in the Exodus period, it happened in the 13th Century, not the 15th. - Something that strikes me as ironic is that many mainstream scholars say that the Exodus that didn't happen had to have happened in the 13th Century BC, at the time of Pharaoh Ramesses, where there's little to no evidence. I was stumped by this problem while making my earlier film until I was shown the earlier pattern of evidence. It seems this same issue is at play with the early alphabet. - If you're saying basically that Moses and Joseph were actually later in time than when this script was invented for the first time, then somebody other than Hebrews or Israelites must've invented it; it couldn't have been them. - The late Thomas Kuhn was a physicist, historician, and philosopher of science. He talked about paradigms in the world of science. A paradigm is a pattern of thinking, a model, or school of thought that everyone in a particular field of study holds to. The world of archeology has its paradigms. A paradigm is based on a set of presuppositions, things that are assumed to be true, and we all have them. In the case of mainstream scholarship, their paradigm for the early books of the Bible not being purely historical seems to be largely based on the key presupposition that an Exodus happened at the time of Ramesses. It puts the Israelites too late in time to be connected with the invention of the Proto-Sinaitic script, which results in the conclusion that the Bible is an untrustworthy oral tradition. Paradigms can blind all of us from seeing the possibility of something new or different. But what if the presuppositions on which those paradigms are based are faulty. In fact, Thomas Kuhn says that science doesn't progress with a gradual accumulation of knowledge, but instead undergoes periodic revolutions or paradigm shifts when some new idea abruptly transforms the views of that particular field. If it was established that the world's oldest alphabet was Hebrew and that Moses did in fact use it to write the Torah, that would change how the world views the Exodus, the Bible, and world history. But to do so would require a major paradigm shift. This brings me back to Flinders Petrie. - Petrie is often known as the father of archeology. The techniques he introduced and his understanding and recognition of the importance of gathering all objects, that applies to archeology anywhere. Petrie also had a startling realization of what this mysterious script in the Sinai meant for the writing of the Bible. Here we have the result at a date some five centuries before the oldest Phoenician writing that is known. It finally disproves the hypothesis that the early Israelites, who came through this region into Egypt and passed back again, could not have used writing. - If the father of Egyptian archeology is telling us that the Israelites have the ability to write 500 years before the Phoenicians, what has changed since then? Is the main change the paradigm of a generation that became skeptical of the Bible because the Ramesses Exodus Theory placed the Exodus at a time when there was little to no evidence to support it. I have now found evidence for all the steps of the original pattern. This script appears by the time of the Exodus. It did not arise in antoher part of the world like Greece, Persia, India or China. It originated in the region of Egypt and the Sinai where the Bible places the early Israelites. The script is the earliest known alphabet which was needed to write the Torah. Because it was a Semitic alphabet, it was a form of writing like Hebrew. This is all Moses would've needed to write the basic form of the Exodus account. In fact I emailed Professor Rollston and asked him, "For the sake of argument, if Moses was responsible "for writing at least part of the Torah, "in your view could the Proto-Sinaitic script "have been used to perform this task?" Rollston replied, "Yes, the script that Moses "could've used or would've used, "would have been Early Alphabetic, not Old Hebrew. "By the way, I believe that Moses was historical "and that he was literate." Speaking of literacy, the use of a simple alphabet would've allowed the Israelite people, young and old, to read it, understand it and preserve the words given by God at Mount Sinai for generation to come. Finally the evidence from all three steps of the Hebrew pattern also show that it could actually be Hebrew. The letters match the look of Hebrew. Some have interpreted the inscriptions as readable Hebrew and the history of the script matches the history of the Israelites. There seems to be no reason to doubt that Moses could have written the Exodus account as the Bible claims. Egyptologist Alan Gardiner, the man who determined these inscriptions were the oldest-known alphabet, came to an insightful observation about its origin. It has been universally recognized that so simple and therefore so perfect an instrument for the visible recording of language could not conceivably have resulted from one spontaneous effort of genius. The alphabet certainly was genius. Yet as a person of faith, I wonder what if the invention of the alphabet did not ultimately have a human source? Because with no alphabet, you would have no Bible. The evidence appears to show that this script did emerge suddenly in a very narrow window of time. The Bible states that it was itself divinely inspired. Could it be that the genius of the alphabet was also a divinely inspired gift from God given to a particular people at a particular time in preparation for what was to come? The prime purpose of communicating the words of God to mankind beginning at Mount Sinai. - There Israel encamped before the mountain while Moses went up to God. The Lord called him out of the mountain saying, "Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob "and tell the people of Israel. "You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, "how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. "Now therefore if you will indeed obey my voice "and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession "among all peoples; "for all the earth is mine "and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests "and a holy nation." God spoke all these words saying, "I am the Lord; I am your God "who brought you out of the land of Egypt "out of the house of slavery. "You shall have no other gods besides me. "You shall not make for yourself a carved image. "You shall not bow to them or serve them. "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain. "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. "Honor your father and your mother. "You shall not murder. "You shall not commit adultery. "You shall not steal. "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. "You shall not covet anything that is your neighbors'." And he gave to Moses the two tablets of the testimony written with the finger of God. In the second year, the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony and the people of Israel set out by stages from the wilderness of Sinai. The law was given to instruct them how they were to live. When the people repeatedly rebelled, it took 40 years before they could enter the land that had been promised to Abraham hundreds of years earlier. During this time, Moses had written down all the instructions from God as well as the history of his people beginning with the creation of the word. When Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a scroll to its very end, Moses commanded the Levites who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. He said, "Take this book of the law "and put it by the side of the Ark of the Covenant "of the Lord your God." I started to think about the fact that words have meaning. In order to preserve their meaning over time, some form of writing was needed. We all take it for granted today, but where did it come from? Before the alphabet, only the elite had this gift of knowledge, but then all that changed. Now everyone had the ability to read with this simple alphabet. This technology hasn't been replaced in nearly 4,000 years, so I continued to wonder. Was the alphabet's arrival at this time in history just a coincidence or was it the gift necessary to retain the knowledge of God? Register ©
