Me, I can't hear the sound of her shoes. Sorry your highness, but you seem not able to fly like a feather. How dare you, you insolent! Go! The art whom I serve is above all! Oh, she is so naughty! Adorable! Very...adorable. Hold still I say! Hold still! One, two. One, two Let me try too, yes?! This is no work for a princess. Just a little bit, okay? All right. Easy, smoothly. And one and... WHAT A HORROR! Your highness! - Your highness! What is this? Did you decide to do this by yourself? You can not do this. How, how gruesom. Did you force her highness to work?! Shame on you! You're lazy and foul! You're a slacker! Shut up you! Ugly witches! Get your hands of him! You tried to clean a horse? What a cute naughty girl you are! Lovely, just lovely! Boy? Hey, boy. Where are you? I'm here. Locked up. Probably because of me, huh? For other sins too. It's very easy to open. They left the key in the keyhole! Boy! Hey,boy! Listen, your highness.... Let's ride this horse. Impossible! And why is that? They will punish me again. Impossible! I am the princess. And if I want I can have your head cut off! Oh! What a lot of flowers! Oh! What a great sky! Look, those are the wonderful Green Mountains. It seems beautiful over there. Even better. There's a shady grove, where the turbulent rivers flow down from the mountains. Brave and fair hunting people live there! All are equal and there is no injustice. So hopefully there are no ladies of the court there as well? Nope. Would you want to go there? - Yes, - Come on then. All right. I can see them. Oh! I see them! Listen up! Follow my lead! Forward! March! Phoei! Why do we drink this water? It's not sweet! But it ís sweet! There is no better water! Your highness, the King will praise us for our bravery We found you! We saved you! What are you doing? Shut up! Your highness! OH! You gave the general a swipe across his bald head with them!?!. But I'm sorry, you can not accompany me in the hunt ! You're too young. So! You think I'm too young!? What brings you here, old lady? I'm looking for the king ... Well, I'm the king? Could you please give out... a meal to this humble old woman? So be it, give her something to eat. Welcome, old lady. Pepper. Salt Let the old lady eat this! Enjoy your meal, my dear old lady. She eats it! It is to your liking, right? Hello dear old lady. Did you eat well? Thank you very much for the food, princess. I will grant you one wish. Tell me what you want? I wish ... I wish ... to float like a feather! Your wish is granted. Henceforth you will be like a Golden Feather. The wind will bring you to me while you're floating. And the rain will prevent you from floating away again. Oh! Your highness is now able to fly! Lovely! -It's a miracle. -She is hovering like an angel! What happened to you, my child? I can float like a feather, like a golden feather But how? And why? The wind whiffles her away! Shut the windows! Quick, shut them! The king's daughter got herself in trouble yesterday! She hovered into the air, but can't get herself down again Come over here! Get me out of here. How boring you are down there. Blow me around! Blow me! Please come and dance a little, my daughter. No, no. What I want is to fly around. Blow at me. All right, all right! How did you get here? What is wrong with you? I can fly. I float like a feather. Oh! My poor daughter! Oh, what a fate. Who has bewitched you like that? Daughter! What is this?! Boy, little boy, save me! The wind will bring you to me while you're floating. And the rain will prevent you from floating away again. I'm thirsty... thirsty. Salt! Pepper! This must be the palace of the old woman. Old lady! ... Old lady! Give me something to eat. There's enough food here. Try it! It's delicious. Ai! How bitter! Old lady, give me something normal to eat! Boy, what are you looking for in these distant lands? I am looking for a princess that was taken by the wind. And you, who are you? Only an old woman. I'm trying to dig out a small magical root, but my strength fails me. Let me grandma! I'll help you! Look! There it is! Take it, grandma. I have to hurry along. Don't hurry away yet! For your good deed, accept this gift. With it, three wishes will be granted to you You just need to play it for them to come through. Only three, remember that! Thank you Grandma! I wish to go where the princess is held. How I can eat this, old woman? It's awfully bitter! Yes, this is not a sweet life, girl! Give me something to drink please, I can't hold out anymore. I wish that these walls would disappear! Why do you drink this water? It's not sweet! This water is sweeter then any honey!. You are no longer a Golden Feather. Now you know how bad you were with the salt and pepper may this bitter experience have learned you a lesson! Well now, the flute can grant one last wish... What would you want? We both want...We want our horse to come back here! Home? - Home! To the palace? - No! To the green mountains! THE END Subs by Eus after a zhura75 & a Spanish translation
