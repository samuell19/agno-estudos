We're losing it! We're losing it! Ugh! Ugh. Joey! Two hands on the net. Two hands! You all right, Joey? The ocean's gone crazy, skipper. Let's get that net in and get home. Move it, come on. We'll all do it together now on three. One, two, three! Ugh! One, two, three! Ugh! One, two, three! Ugh! [groaning] [growling] Man overboard! Get a line out there! Joey! I can't see him. [inaudible] I can't see him. Throw it again! Joey, Joey, Joey! Joey! No! Joey! He's gone. Damn it, we lost him! Joey's the second man we lost this year. What do you mean, second? Who else died? Calvin died last month. Or did you forget? He was 65, and he had a bad heart. Still died. He was in his bed, numbskull. It's not like he was out at sea. I still say it's a harbinger. What are you talking about? Ships ain't coming back withfish, and crewmen are dying. It's a harbinger. Before you know it, an albatrossis gonna fall out of the sky. [splat] Oh. Ugh. Oh, yeah. Something's falling out of the sky all right. That is nasty. Something funny? No, sir. No, sir. You guys have got a lot of work to do. Make sure you finish in timeto pay your respects, huh? You got it, skipper. See you inside. Be good. Sir. [sigh] Hi. Hi. You OK? [sigh] That was awkward. I think your father knows something's up Why would you say that? Well, the way he looks at me, like he wants to chop me up andthrow me in the chum bucket. Come on, Danny. Stop being so paranoid. I'll stop being paranoid whenyou tell me we're going out. Can we not talk about that here? Sure. You might be wondering whywe're here, not at a church. Well, Joey knew that all you bums would just end up here anyway. [chuckling] So he would want us to cut to the chase. No offense, Father. To Joey! To Joey! To Joey! Nothing tougher than losing a crewman. You got that right, Ben. You just make sure it'snot my boy, Danny, next time. Yeah. Erin, guess what. - You got the cabin? - Shh. My dad is in there, and hedoesn't know I took them. You mean, you lied to your dad? He would kill me. You mean, you still haven'ttold him you're seeing Danny? He thinks if I fall in love with a local, I won't go to university. So just don't tell him Danny is coming with us. All right, it's the last one, Drew. Let's get out of here. I ain't going anywhere. Gotta work the night shift. I thought you and Erin weregoing to the island with us. Yeah, she's gonna leave with you guys tonight. I'll meet up with her in the morning. That sucks. Hey, no big deal. Anyway, given how we lost our last catch and didn't make a dime, least I know I'll be getting paid for something. Yeah, well, just make sure you show up. I don't wanna get stuckall weekend with two girls. And that's a bad thing? - Later, Drew. - Yeah, man. I'll see you tomorrow. All right. Hey, you got something on your line. Holy, man. You know, every day sinceI've started working at this dock I drop a line, and you know how many times I caught something? Yeah, I know. Never. Wow, it's heavy. You green horn. Need some help? Get me the net! Damn! I lost it. - Hang on. There's something in the net. Holy. That's a dead albatross, isn't it? This is a harbinger, right? Get rid of it. Don't let anyone see it. Hey, why is this bad again? Looks like you're in abit of a rut there, Will. I mean, that's a new low for you, isn't it? Oh, yeah. Heard you lost your catch. That's a damn shame. You still gotta pay me for the boat, Will. You'll get your money. When? I got a good feeling. We're going back out. Yeah, you and your feelings. You know, maybe you just don'thave the stones for this game anymore. I mean, to come back with fish is one thing. Coming back without your crew is-- Hey, hey! Just shut up, Roy! Tough guy. Take your best shot. There a problem, Roy? No. No problem, Sheriff. Just reminding your deadbeat brother here that catch or no catch, he's still gotta pay me for my boat. Will's no deadbeat. You know that. Hey, you want anothergo, you gotta pay up first. You're not thinking about going back out there again, are you? You know how expensive college is these days? You-- you got some time? Yeah, sure. What's up? Biology lady, the one checkingout the fishing problem? She found something. I thought I'd bring out a fisherman. [chuckling] Come on, help your brother out. Nobody knows these waters like you. Come on. Hey, Arden. Hey, Jay. Will. I heard you lost a member of your crew. I'm sorry. Thanks. So what did you find? Caulerpa taxifolia. It's a very invasive species of algae. So is that what's killing our fish? Could be. This particular type of algae produces extremely high amounts of a chemical toxic to many fish species. It can break down an entire ecosystem. Well, how do we determineif it's the cause or not? Well, what I found couldbe from a few patches that are controllable, or itcould be a massive outbreak. From the decline in the fishpopulation, I fear the latter. But I'm taking a boat out tomorrow morning, and I'll let you boys know what I up with. OK, thanks. What are you looking at? Her buckets. Yeah. Hey, it's promising. I mean, maybe she'll-- maybe she'll finally get to the bottom of this. Ah, that could take months, huh? Then what? Who's gonna to pay to fix it? Yeah. - Nice ass. - Hey, babe. We're off to the island. Oh, OK. Cool. I'll see you guys there tomorrow. You better, 'cause I'll be really mad if I have to spend the weekend with Danny and Carly without you. CARLY: Let's go, Erin! Ugh. All aboard. I love you. I love you too. Mwah. Be safe. All right. Bye, babe! See you guys tomorrow. I saw you. Some kind of big grouper or something? Hello? [hissing] What do you think you're doing? I'm shipping out again. Not on my boat you're not. Maybe you haven't heard, but they just issued a major storm warning. Yeah, my weather guy says it'll miss us. Cold front's gonna push itnorth of where we're going. You got any crew? I got enough guys. I'll make up for that catch I lost. Waters haven't been kind. I got bills. Which reminds me, I ain't running no charity organization. It's all there. What did you do, rob a bank? Do I get the boat or not? What guarantee do I have you're not gonna screw up again? Look, I got caught last trip. That's the first and lasttime that's gonna happen. You make sure of that! Drew! [sigh] Drew! [thud] Oh, god. [flies buzzing] Drew! ARDEN: Morning. Hi. What happened here? I have no idea. I was expecting one of my crewmen to have a boat ready to go out this morning, and I find the dock like this. Have you ever-- have you everseen anything like this before? No. Look at that. Huh. There's some here. There's something there. It goes right off the end. Did you see that? What? No, there was something. I can see it. Oh! [tapping] [tapping] Agh! You idiot. Were you just throwing rocks at the window? No, why? Because I heard a tapping on the glass, like someone throwing rocks or something. There must be a creepy pervert on the island. No, that would be you. What are you doing? I'm unpacking. What does it look like? Why are you bothering with that? Uh, so the clothes don't wrinkle, dumb ass. Well, who said anything about wearing clothes? Um, is Drew here yet? I don't know. And I haven't seen him or Erin. You know, we're gonna need firewood if you wanna make breakfast. OK. I'll get right on that. I'm gonna look for Erin. [shutter snaps] What do you think, Jay? There's no way a shark did that. [shutter snaps] I don't know. I think an animal might havecome down and attacked him. An animal came down out of the woods and attacked him and left nothing but a couple of body partsfloating around in the water? - Well, I-- I don't know.- No blood anywhere? What else could it be? Look, we'll-- we'll form a hunting party. If there's a sick or rabid animal out there, we'll find it. You're not going back out there, are you? Good. Look, I'm sorry about Drew. Yeah. You OK? [shutter snaps] I just wasn't quite ready for that. Got any thoughts on whatthat green stuff might be? No, it might be some kind of fungus. But I don't know. The strange way it's discolored the dock indicates it has an acidic property. Can I show yousomething else real quick? See right here? Yeah. And here? This is the same stuff that's over on in dock. Yeah. I guess whatever it was that was on the dock was also on this boat. Yeah, except this was here before we docked. How can that be? Well, I don't know. You're the head biologist. You tell me. Is there any kind of creature that you know of that could leavesomething like this behind? I'll run some tests, findout exactly what this is. Yeah. Good morning. Good morning, Carly. Where's Drew? He didn't show? He promised he wouldn't do this to me. I'm sure he'll show. Come back to the cabin with me, OK? Danny's making breakfast. No, I'm not hungry. I just can't believe he didn't come. All right. I'll save you something incase you change your mind. Oh my god! [growling] Hey, Ben. I need to talk to you. Talk? To an old drunk? Look, we've got quite a situation on our hands here, OK? Something killed Drew on the dock last night. What do mean, "something"? I don't know. So what do you want with me? You lost a crewman in a storm just like I did. I wanna know what happened. You know the damn Story. No, I don't. All this talk about sea monsters. It was a shark. That's what my crew said, sothat's what it must have been. What did you really see? Could have been a shark. I seen a mako jump 15 foot once. Right over the dead to the other side. It wasn't a shark, Ben. I saw it too. And whatever it was, it took Joey. You're crazy. Listen to me! Whatever that thing is, it leftsome kind of disgusting slime on the dock right where it attacked Drew. I found find the same stuffon my boat where it took Joey. I think this thingfollowed me back to town. I'm coming clean on what I saw. I have to. And I need you to back me up. So you can't be all liquored up. I need you clean and sober. I need you to tell the people ofthis town exactly what you saw, Ben! I don't know what you're talking about. You go and sell version ofcrazy to whoever'll buy it. [door opens and closes] [growling] [growling] What is that? [growling] That's something you don't see everyday. [growling] Hold still, buddy. They told me you wereworking out here all day. Hi. Thought you might like a fresh cup of coffee. Thanks. So did you figure out whatthat slime was from the dock? It's a toxin. Some form of venom. Highly concentrated. Venom? Like from a sea snake? Uh, more like what youfind in an ambush predator, like a sea devil. Isn't that like a deep sea angler fish? And a master of disguise. Camouflages itself toblend into its environment. Then, when anunsuspecting prey passes, it sprays a venom, which paralyzes the prey. You're telling me that some deep sea predator paralyzed Drew and then ate him? No, I'm just telling youthe properties of the slime and where it's found in nature. What it was doing on the dockand your boat, I have no idea. The bottom of the ocean is one thing, but whatever this venom isfrom, it's coming on land now. [growling] [screaming] Agh! Quick, get in the truck. What are you doing? Get in, get in. And lock the door. Oh, god. [growling] [gunshots] [growling] [growling] [gunshots] What are you doing? Something bit me. Oh my god! Whatever it was, I got a picture of it. Let me see. What is that thing? No idea. Never seen anything like it. Kind of looks like an angler fish. An angler fish? Yeah, those deep sea fish with a big thing on their head to lure the prey. Oh, god. That looks horrible. Well, did we come hereto worry about my hand or-- [police radio chatter] CARLY [ON VOICEMAIL]: Hi, this is Carly. You know the drill. Hey, Carly. It's me, Dad. Honey, will you please call me an let me know you're still alive? Please? All right, I love you. How's Arden doing? She's holding up OK. She can't confirm what you saw. All she saw was bloodsplattered on that window. Who or what tore those kidsup, she didn't have a clue. I already told you what did it. Well, are you sure it wasn'tsome psycho in a costume? Jay, this thing jumped 30 feet into the air. It took bullets like I was shooting BB's. Yeah, what? What am I supposed to do with some crazy creature story, Will? This isn't the first time I've seen it. Huh? The night of the storm, itwasn't a wave that took Joe. It was that thing. For god's sakes. Do you know who you sound like? You've got no idea what you saw that night. You were hit in the head. It was pissing rain. Joey could have slipped on the deck and fallen overboard in that storm. That's what I was hoping too. But after this, there'sno denying that what I saw was real. Don't make a fool of yourself, Will. Look, I'm gonna call the staties in on this, OK? I'll rally the boys. We'll meet up at the tavern. We'll need some help hunting this thing down. Man, beast, or whatever it is. You're all sweaty. Let me see your hand. You're not gonna propose to me, are you? That is disgusting. You look horrible. Maybe we should just go home. No, I'm not gonna be theone to ruin this weekend. Well, if you die, that will definitely ruin it. I'm not dying. All right, let's just go to theboat and get the first aid kit. All right, listen up. The storm moving up the coast has wind gusts up to 100 miles an hour. Which means we're not gonnaget any immediate assistance on a more urgent matter. Drew is dead. Today, up at the bluffs, someof our kids were ripped apart. Kids? Eyewitness is sayingit's some kind of creature. That what you think, Sheriff? I don't know. It may be a-- a bear, or worse, some homicidalmaniac dressed up in a costume, seen one too many horror pictures. But whatever it is, we gotta find it. And we gotta find it fast. Look, it's not a guy in a costume. How do you know, Will? Because I've seen it,Roy, with my own two eyes, all right? Today and on my boat, when it took Joey. [chuckling] You can't be serious. I'm dead serious. And I think it followed me back here. Here's crazy. Sounds like you've beendrinking out of the same bottle as Ben. Oh, speak of the devil. Here's someone'll back upyour sea monster story. Shut up, Roy. You don't know spit. What do you know, you drunk? Why don't you crawl back into your bottle and let us handle this? All right, Roy. That's enough. You all remember the Duke. And I know you all rememberthe night he didn't come home. We were running a Chinookup near the point. Must have had 80,000 inthe hold before midnight. We had one net left to grab. The Duke, well, he says he sees something off the starboard bow. And then he's gone. Well, the crew, a bunch of green horns, said they thought a shark took them. Well, now, I ain't no green horn. You can believe me when I tellyou, that weren't no shark. Will here, he knows what he saw. A predator, so cold and vile you'd think he was spawned by the devil himself. Sheriff, just had a call from my sister. Says she saw some kind of monster climbing a tree in the park. Big as a bear, she said. You guys wanna grab your rods and your reels and go look for the Loch Nessmonster, you have your fun. I'm going hunting. Just-- just hold on, Roy. Let's be smart about this. And what? You wanna wait till more people die, Sheriff? No, but we're gonna do this together. Then let's do it. Hey, Will, you tell Nancy I says hi. Jay, you don't believe us? Look it's-- it's not amatter of what I believe, Will. We gotta find this thing and stop it before it kills somebody else. You people, stay home. You stay there till we findthis thing, till it's safe. Jay, you don't know whatyou're getting into here. You need professionals to handle this. Oh, that's funny. I thought I was a professional. Go home. I could use a drink. Not yet. I got one more person I need you to talk to. Where's the boat? I'm gonna strangle her. You think Erin took the boat? Who else, Carly? Erin's gone and the boat's gone. Do the math. Why would she take the boat, Danny? Are you kidding me? She went back to the mainland tochew our Drew for standing up. Erin! If she's dead, I'm gonna kill her. Well, not if that grossinfection kills you first. Don't touch it. Arden. Hey. This is Ben. Hi, Ben. - Ma'am. - Where you headed? Diving. Diving? Are you nuts? You can't go diving out there on your own with this thing in the water. Look, you've got people dying. And it's quite possiblethe venom we found actually is from some deep sea predator. The only way we're gonna know is if someone goes out there and investigates. I like her. Where to? Well, this thing's from ocean water, so it's gonna feel mostcomfortable in a deep area, where the watertemperature is the lowest and the salinity is the highest. Hey, Ben. You know any placedeeper than Goliath Drop? Not in these parts. Goliath Drop it is, then. Erin, Erin! Erin! [growling] Erin! Where? Where are you? I can't find her anywhere. That's because she stole theboat and went back to town. No, she wouldn't do that. Do you have a better explanation? Well, what if something bad happened? Like what? I don't know. Pirates? Pirates? Give me a break. There's one logical explanation. She took the boat and went to get Drew. Maybe. But that means she'll be back soon. She better be. Looks like right here, Will. All right, let's travel as far as we can before the storm comes in. Keep your eyes in the trees. Apparently, this thing climbs. So let me get this straight. You're saying this thingis one of God's creatures? I'm saying it's possibleit's an undiscovered species we never knew existed. And how often does that happen? Every so often. After the 2004 tsunami, over14 new species of aquatic life were found, dredged up from thebottom of the sea by the wave. And we've only just scratched the surface of what lives down there. Yeah, well, out of that14, how many of those were in amphibious man-eaters, huh? None. There's gotta be a betterway than you going down into harm's way there, darling. I've gone down with greatwhites off the Barrier Reef without a cage. I'll be fine. Wait here. [flies buzzing] [footsteps] Did you hear that? Yeah. [growling] [growling] We got a fresh carcass. This thing could be close. Let's-- let's spread out,see if we can find it. [snarling] [growling] [growling] [growling] [snarling] Anything? No, we're just chasing our tails. MAN: Oh my god! Oh, damn it, what's your problem? Come on, you mother! Show your ass. Calm down, Roy. [growling] There! [gunshots] Hold your fire. There's nothing there. [gunshots] Stop! Hold your fire! Stop. There's nothing there. What's wrong with you guys? Listen to me. We lose our heads, we are dead. Pull together, Roy. Let's go. Follow me. This way, come on. Come on! [beeping] I can't believe this. There's no reception inthe cabin, none out here. I think it's safe to say we just aren't gonna get reception on this island. Who doesn't have a landline in their home? It's not a home. It's a cabin. It's a peaceful retreat where my dad wants to get away from technology. A phone isn't technology. It's a basic form of communication that one can use to call for help if their hand's about to fall off. What are you doing? Maybe if I squeeze it it'll help it heal. You know? Like a zit? Oh, god! That is disgusting! Oh, you need to rinse that off. What, With salt water? Then let's go back to the cabin. You have to get that cleaned up. That's just-- that's gross. [growling] [screaming] [gunshots] What the hell? [gunshots] Roy, it's coming your way! [snarling] I got it, Jay! I got it! Now, what on earth are you? We may have a bigger problem than we thought. What the heck is that? A hatched egg. You're kidding. Does this thing belong to the creature? Nothing else in these waterscan lay an egg like this. Are there any more of these down there? This is the only one I found, which leads me to believe that thisegg hatched somewhere else and was swept here by the current. "Somewhere else." So what you're saying is thatthere's probably more of them down there. And if this thing is amphibious, its young may have gone ashore to feed. All right, we gotta head back. Jay's gonna wanna hear about this. Oh my god. This is Erin's. Are you sure? I told you it was pirates. [screaming] Oh my god. It's not pirates. Let's just go back to the cabin. Oh! [screaming] That's the thing that bit me. Ow! This thing's from the water, right? But it's preying on land. What's on your mind, Ben? Draw it out of the water, baitit onto land, and then kill it. Maybe. We'll see how Jay made out first. Carly, it's Dad again. I'm getting worried. Will you please call me? Love you. I gotta find my daughter. She's supposed to be staying theweekend at her friend's house. I can't get in touch with anyone. I saw her and some kidsleave in a boat late yesterday. What kids? Uh, looked like Erin and Danny. Danny? Oh, I should have known thatshe was pulling the wool over my eyes the entire time. Don't blame yourself. Girls will be girls. WOMAN [ON RADIO]: An unexpected cold front is now moving in that will pushthe adapting storm away from -- Any word from Jay? No, do you want me to try him on the radio? Please. Sheriff, this is the harbormaster. Do you copy? [static] Sheriff, this is the harbormaster. Do you copy? [static] Jay, are you there? [static] Jay, I got Will here for you. Do you copy? [static] He's not answering. I'm going out there. I'll go with you. What was that thing? I can't believe it killed Erin. Shh! Quiet. Do you think there's others? I don't know. Maybe. Let's just get back to thecabin and figure this out, OK? Come on. Come on. [growling] Jay? Jay! Ready? Jay? Ugh! Here, here, here, here. Wrap it up with this. We gotta get off this island. How? Nobody knows we're here, not even my dad. Drew does. How do you know that thing didn't kill Drew and that's why he never showed up? [growling] Do you hear that? It sounds like that thing. I don't see anything. Maybe it was a bird. You see anything? Oh my god. [growling] - We're screwed. - Don't say that! Can't you figure out away to kill those things? Does your have a rifle here? He fishes, he doesn't hunt! Well, what do you expect me to do? Well, you're the fisherman! Figure it out! These aren't fish, Carly! You told me it looked like an angler fish. Where does your dad keep his fishing gear? All right. [growling] One, two, three. Push! It sounds like they'retrying to get in upstairs. Danny. [screaming] [whimpering] [screeching] - It's calling for help. - No way. Shh! Listen. [screeching] Whoa. Nice, Carly. [screaming] [screeching] [screeching] [screaming] Danny! [screaming] [screaming] [growling] Turn the light switch on! Carly! [screaming] [crackling] [screeching] Danny! In there, go! Ben, what is going on here? Have you lost your mind? That's what they tell me. Look, I don't knowwhether you have any idea of what's been going on here. You better stay clear of these docks for a while. Who do you think youare, ordering me like that? If I were you, I'd go on and get out here now. Ben, you are gonna get yourself killed. That's my business. Now, you go on. Get out of here. [sigh] Fine. Come on, my little friend. Get some of this. Oh my god. Oh, no. Sheriff, this is the harbormaster. Do you copy? Sheriff, this is the harbormaster. Do you copy? Barbara, this is Will. The sheriff is dead. Jay's dead. Oh my god. What about Roy and all the others? They're all dead. Will, I-- I need you to get back down here. Ben has gone over the deep end. He's-- he's building somekind of cage on the dock. He's setting himself up as bait. I'm on my way. [flies buzzing] Come on, you dumb fish. I got some quality meat right here for you. Ben. Will is on his way down hereto talk some sense into you. [growling] Stop, Barbara, go back! Don't point that thing at me. Run! [growling] Barbara! No! No. [gunshot] [growling] I got another one for you! Ugh. [groaning] Sounds like they'rehaving a feast out there. We need to get out of here. I don't wanna end up like Erin. We're not going anywhereuntil those things leave. But what if they don't leave? What if they eat all our foodand then they come up here and they eat us? Even if we could escape,where are we gonna go? The boat's gone. There's nothing on this freaking island. Well, what about the ferry? What ferry? That old ferry that my dad used to work on when he was a kid. What good is that? It's sunk. It's been sitting in thelagoon since I can remember. Well, maybe they have aradio on it that we can use. How are you gonna use aradio if there's no power? OK, fine! Then we'll just stay here and die! [sigh] You know, sometimes theykeep emergency batteries in those radios in case of a power loss. I mean, it's a long shot it'dstill have juice after all these years, but maybe. Will, I know you're upset, but given what happened to the hunting party, we don't know how effectivebullets will be on this thing. I know one thing. It bleeds. Let's go. I don't hear anything. Sounds like they're gone. Ready? I don't see 'em anywhere. I think the ferry's on thesouth side of the island. We gotta go that way. Ugh! [screaming] [whimpering] [coughing] Carly! [screaming] [coughing] I don't wanna die, Danny. I don't wanna die. No, no, we're not gonna die. [coughing] We gotta keep moving. Oh my god. Oh my god. Ben! Ben. Ben. Ben. He's dead. The venom killed him. [beeping] You hear that? What is that? Huh? Son of a bitch. What is that? It's a hunting GPS tracker. Ben would have-- he'd embeda microchip with his spear gun inside a fish in case he got away, so he could track it, catch it later. So the chip is in the creature? Yeah. And the creature's headed to the island. Danny's boat's not in.That means they're still out. I think Carly took him to the island, to my cabin. And that thing is there with them. Yeah. Boy, talk about jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire. Yeah, well, at leastthose things aren't here. Does it work? Emergency battery's toast. So now what? Look for flares. [beeping] The signal's getting stronger! It's here! At the cabin? No, it's coming from thefar side of the island. We better get the kids off the island. We'd better kill this thing. Will, let's get the kids first. Yeah. Are you sure you know what you're doing? I'm looking for a flare kit. Keep an eye out for any type of emergency box. Are you kidding? This place has been stripped to the bone. Do you have a better idea, Carly? Yeah. Find the safest, most secure room on this ship and barricade ourselves in there in case those things decide to visit. All right. We're gonna keep searching first. Carly? Carly? There's nothing! OK. Guess there's no flares. CARLY: Bingo. Nice. Carly? Carly! Carly, Danny? Carly, Danny! Will. They're alive. Let's go find your safe, secure room. This looks good. We can seal ourselves in for the night. [roaring] They're here. It didn't sound anythinglike those things. Well, what was it? Here. Wait in here. OK, what are you doing? I'm gonna go check things out.I'll be right back. No, please come in here and hide. Don't worry. I got this now. Go on, get in. All right, stick this rod through the spokes. Keep the door locked. Don't come out until I tell you. Be careful. DANNY: Stick the rod through the spokes. OK. [roaring] I'll be right back. [roaring] What is that? It's a call. A call to who? Come on. [growling] Must be bedtime. Or feeding time. [roaring] Carly? [roaring] Let's go. [roaring] Danny? Oh my god. [screaming] [footsteps] Outside. You hear that? Yeah. [beeping] There's something up there. [beeping] Whoa! Danny! Skipper. Where's Carly? Is she all right? She's safe and sound, skip. Take me to her. She's this way. [rapid beeping] Wait! Ugh! Danny! Danny! [screaming] Carly? Oh, good, Carly. Oh, thank god. oh, thank god. Will. Where's Danny? I'm sorry. We gotta go. We gotta go. [beeping] What have you got? It's above us now. That's strange. It's circling. Really? CARLY: Oh my god. Look. That's why she's circling. Doesn't want her kids caughtin the middle of a gunfight. So as long as we babysit, we're safe? We can't leave here without destroying the nest and all the creatures. I know. I know. I used to be a welder on this ship. I got an idea. Come on.
