I'm sittin' in this nice, warm, police car. - [Cody] Shit, got a little one, hey!

Hey look come on, there's nothing you could have done. You were drenched in gas and if you would have pulled that trigger, boom you would have been just like her. - [Cody] I panicked, I didn't think. - Yeah, I remember, a few years ago, I was working a barbershop. You know, running numbers. Every morning, you know, I'd wait for the drop. Finally when it went down, I mean I lept to my feet, I had my gun drawn and I fainted. (chuckling) I forgot he was shaving me. I slashed my own throat. One look at all that blood, I collapsed. Woke up in the hospital, turns out the guy I was arresting saved my life. - [Cody] Thanks Heineman. Whoa. - Hey, what about my coat? - Send it to the cleaners. I'll pay. ("Fire Dance" by John O'Kennedy) (whooshing) (clapping) - Ray. I'm quitting. Just for a little while, I've got some family problems. But I'll be back, I promise. - Roxanne I've got nobody to sub for you. I'd get down on my knees, except I'd never get up again. - Sorry. - If you don't go on, you can kiss last week's check goodbye.

D, you know what this means? - French tickler. - I don't know but can I sit on it? - Last night one of our dancers forgot to take off her top. - They weren't clapping or nothing, I did a flip, no hands and they didn't even notice. I'm not gonna take my top off unless they deserve it. - They paid their admission, they're buying drinks, which takes care of your salary. Now I want you to go out there and give 'em what they came here for. - Fuck that Ray. Why don't you just hire a bunch of 18 year old junkies to go bottomless and wiggle their tonsils in the customer's faces. - The only junkie I know is sitting right in front of me. - Oh, I'm hurt Ray. - Well? - I'll do my job. - Thank you. Where's Angel? - I don't know. - Great, a stripper. (sighing) How are they gonna keep this quiet? Mmm, okay, 15. Bye. - [Heineman] Morning. - Very Malibu, Heineman. Having fun yet? (tires screeching) Where did you get this thing? - Somebody picked it up on a drug bust. Just temporary, the motor pool is trying to find a top. - The B-team come up with anything? - They dropped in on the other strippers, found them uniformly uncooperative. I just don't understand why civilians get so upset when you wake 'em up at four in the morning as ask 'em if they killed somebody. I mean it just doesn't make any sense, you know? - I want it. - Well, two-home assigns Court. - I was the first detective on the scene. - There's ways. - How ominous. What do I have to do? - Take off your clothes. - Oh God. - What, you get a job at the club, you talk to the girls and check the place out. Hey, forget it, right? Forget it. (grunting) - Dammit. (laughing) - Just kidding around, hey no problem, just fooling around, okay? - [Cody] Are you out of your mind? - I figured you needed a little Zen training after that gasoline episode. - Thanks. - Don't give in to that asshole! - Not a chance. - Are you listening? You're not fighting a weapon, you're fighting a person. This way you're in control of the situation and the situation doesn't control you. Take it, forte. (laughing) (thudding) (grunting) Your eyes gave you away. It's the eyes not the knife that tells the intention. - What are my eyes saying now? (chuckling) Isn't there some sort of departmental regulation about this out the door? - [Heineman] About what? - Flashing my tits. (thudding) Mind your own business. - So homicide, talked to a few guys, completely up to you. They got this amateur contest tonight. The winner usually gets hired. - You're the one. Hello, Kenny. - What? - Last year I received this chain letter asking me to share love with 20 other people by sending them xerox copies of this message. At the bottom it warned me that if I didn't do that, a curse would destroy the lives of my future children. And now I know who sent it. - Pardon me if I'm interrupting what I'm sure is very important deductive brainstorming session, but I have been granted the privilege of bringing you your messages. Here's an interesting one, motorpool can't find top, you're stuck with car. - Whoa. - They anticipated, just such, a reaction. - [Heineman] Can you believe this? - You know you're sure going to an awful lot of trouble to see me topless. We should have had an affair when we had the chance. - You don't date single guys. - Ouch. - Who's Sunny? - Oh, just some mindless physical (mumbling) and attraction. - Dating already? - That's right. - Good. Good, that's good for you. How's old Nina doing? - Well, I don't know, we don't talk. Her lawyer writes me. So, what do you think, huh? - What if I don't win? - You have nothing to worry about. Don't get nervous, I've done this before. My sister owns a whorehouse. No, I will not tell you where. You might end up in Vice. Close. - Jeez. Wait'll you see these threads. Size six, right? - My sister said always beware the ones that go for the feet. - On stage. Off stage. What do you think? - You're gonna look great. - Don't worry, this is gonna work. Some of the guys don't mind spending the night off to come down to the strip club to see ya. - What guys? - Look, they use applause memes, see, so a few ringers in there is gonna make all the difference. Guys are volunteering all over the place. - You mean half the force is gonna see me naked?

That's right, three $100 bills! Where else can a girl earn $300 for a night's work? Don't answer that. - How do you like those cops? Good morning, miss, your friend is dead. The 20 sluts did it. Friend of ours was killed last night. What's your act? - My timing was great. - [Dazzle] I never knew anyone who died before. - Everyone I know dies on me. Stick around, you'll probably get the job.

What a trooper. Let's give her a big hand! And a walker. - Doesn't feel like Angel's gone. I know in my head but it just isn't real. - Do they know who did it? - I'm gonna go to church and say some prayers for her tomorrow. - There's a pretty one down on Waymer. - Hey, what's the difference between a girl and sushi? Rice, get it? (chuckling) - What are you doing here girl? - No where else to go. - Hi, my name's Sunny. - [Woman] The big winner. (melancholy music) - I'm sorry. - Life is shit and then you die. You might even have to try men. (chuckling) - Cinnamon took some sensitivity training and never quite recovered. - Ray that's-- - I don't wanna hear about it. I thought you needed some time off. - I have to work. - It's an off night, you know, Ray? Angel's fuckin' dead. - Baby, I'm gonna have to let you go. I can't do it anymore. I warned you about the pills. - [Brandy] You didn't fall off the stage again? - It's just a sprain. Be fine tomorrow. - No, you won't. Now, look, I don't wanna see you for a long time. - I can get clean. I got the number-- - No! - Goddamn you, Ray. (melancholy music) (slamming) - Taxi! - We got a threesome going, wanna come? - Yeah, we'll split the profits. (laughing) - Sluts! (clattering) (chuckling) - Rice, I get it. - Last night before Angel was killed, Pocket was back here. He did something to her. She wouldn't talk about it, but she was afraid. - Come on, he's been here longer than I have. - [Cody] Who's pocket? - He's just some weirdo that jacks off through a hole in his pocket. No big deal. He doesn't get it on the floor or anything. - Well, thanks for letting me use the dressing room, and I'm sorry about your friend. - Sunny, you on drugs? - No. Well, sometimes a little grass. - You reliable? - Very. - You gonna screw me? - For the job? - I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about you screwing me over if I should hire you. - I don't screw people around. - You are the worst dancer I ever saw in my life. You're hired. - What do you pay? - [Derek] A most evocative performer comes to us from Paris, France, Mademoiselle Fanny.

Is it safe to keep my stuff in it? - Yeah, only a few of the girls steal things. That's my move, the bitch. - [Cody] Who is that? - Fuzzy rugfucker. - [Cody] What? - Fanny, the fuzzy rugfucker. That's what it's called. She was pregnant once. She was dancing on stage, I said, "Girl, you look fat." She said, "I'm not fat, I'm pregnant." - [Cody] What happened? - She gave it up, she didn't wanna kill anybody. One day, she's gonna find her. - Who's that? The guy with the headphones on. - [Dazzle] That's the guy I was telling you about, Mr. Pocket. * It's a job like any other job * * So be prepared to pay * It's a night like any other night * * So be prepared to stay - Got the job. Local pervert, keep an eye on him. - Sunny? - Hmm. (chuckling) Who's winning? Hello? Ooh, oh, I am so so-- Does it bother you when I touch you? I was joking. Sit down. So, what about the dead girl? And here I am taking her place. What do you think about that? Sad, I mean. - Who died? - Angel. - Beautiful.

(footsteps clomping) (tense music) (groaning) - You know, you are really amazing up there. - Really, thanks. - Just incredible. - That's really nice coming from a woman. Usually just the guys say that. - Goodnight. - God bless. (tense music) - Jesus, partner! (laughing) Get out of here! - Well, now we're even. You know what I look like, and I know what you look like. - Hey, don't you have any sense of propriety? - What are you doing in my house? - I was worried about you, Sunny. Bet you think it's really hilarious that you used her name, huh? - I needed one that implied slut. (flushing) (chuckling) - I'm mad, all right, I'm mad. I came back here 'cause I care about you. You know, and to give you a warning, too. Take it easy. - You broke into my house to tell me not to enjoy my work? - Yeah, and to use the facilities. Maybe this whole gig's a bad idea, you know? - How's Mr. Pocket? - Who? - The pervert. - Oh, lost him. Well, what did you get? - Makes paper flowers and gives them to the girls. I don't know, something's wrong. He has this thing about being touched. I don't think he did it. - He likes knives. Saw him shop from one of our local mobile entrepreneurs. - Did he buy one? - He was just playin' with it, very well. He took something. - What? - I don't know, I couldn't see. I must have been breast blind. Think if I would have seen one more tit I would have thrown up. - I thought men liked watching tits flop around. - I don't like to see yours flopping around. - They don't flop. - [Heineman] Yeah, I noticed that. See you tomorrow. Hey, don't bother locking your deadbolt. This place is a piece of cake. - Goodnight, Heineman. (door slamming) - [Man On Tape] Visualize yourself aiming at the target. You are calm and relaxed. - [Heineman] What took you? - Had to go shopping. You have any idea how much a pair of fishnet stockings cost? - 14 bucks. - [Cody] What are you doing? - It's self-hypnosis. - How long have you been doing that? - A while. - [Cody] It help much? - I don't know, I never get to shoot anymore. Do you wanna know about the girls? - Yeah. - Got a runaway who is now legal, and we got an assault. - An assault? - A Charlotte Atula, AKA Dazzle, accused of beatin' the daylights out of some girl in a bar, and I quote, no way, I just held her fanny and I, wait. And I quote, no way. I just held her. Fanny hit her, AKA Katherine Berry. Charges were dropped. - Who's the runaway? - Roxanne Behr. Seems her dad is your typical hardworking wife-beater, got a little carried away one day, he killed mom. Now she and her brother, Eric, witnessed it, and they just split. They're two ex street hustlers. - What about the Captain and Gilligan? - Well, you can take your pick of a half a dozen witnesses who can place Ray and Derek in the club at the time of the murder. - What'd you find on Pocket? - Diddly squat. I mean, believe it or not, there's no Mr. Pocket in the phone book. - Oh, I'll call ya when he comes to the club. You know, it could one of the girls. I don't know, jealousy, maybe. - I gotta bribe the coroner. Hey, think fast. That's for stress. ("California Plates" by Mark McKinnis) * He couldn't believe his eyes * When she rattled into town * Crawling by the legs and her hair hanging down * * He wasn't thinking that ended the best way * * So he copied down the number on a California plate * - [Derek] I'd like to get tangled in her web. Let's hear it for Brandy. (clapping) - Who put their stogie out in my cup? - Oops. - [Brandy] You twat. - Why won't you just gimme a break? Just go out with me just once. - I'm not going out with you. I'm hassled enough out there. I don't need to be hassled in here. - Very sensitive, Brandy. - I've never seen anybody jack off a snake before. - She's stressed. I'm giving her a massage. ("Rickshaw Suite" by John O'Kennedy) - Come on, Cinnamon, answer. - You killed her, you bastard! You did it. You sick son of a bitch. - [Dazzle] What'd you do to Angel? - I got her... flowers. - Don't touch her. (clattering) Where's Cinnamon? - [Pocket] She's not here. - Where is she? Come on, you like to watch? Take a good look. - He likes heels. - What the hell are you doing? What are you doing? Hey, hey wait a minute. - He killed Angel! - He confessed? - Close enough. - Oh great. Just great, why didn't you call the cops? - They don't care about us. - We did it for Roxanne. - Why? (sirens blaring) - Figure it out. - They were lovers? - It's not like you think. They really had something. (melancholy music) - [Cody] How 'bout a flower? - Oh, thank you. It's pretty good, isn't it? - I found out that Roxanne and Angel were having a relationship. With Cinnamon missing, who knows? Maybe, maybe she and Angel were fooling around, Roxanne found out about it and killed them both. - Yeah. - Well, it has a ring to it. - Last bite? - Cinnamon bothers me. - Try lemon. You've got no sense of humor. (chuckling) Nobody's reported her missing. Why don't we concentrate on what we've got, you know, instead of trying to see murder every time somebody's late to work? - I'll try and control myself. Where's the autopsy report? - Ah, he's all backed up. - What happened to your bribe? - He already had that issue. - How 'bout putting a tail on Roxanne? - You know, we gotta have something a little more substantial than it has a ring to it. - Now that has a ring to it. Look, Heineman, 90% of the time, it's the lover. I think we should check out the brother, too. Maybe he's the jealous type. - It's on my list. Come on, last bite, that's it. - I'll pass. - Suit yourself. Hey, ooh, ah! Ooh, oh! - Dammit! When are you gonna stop sublimating with that thing? - Hey, that's a big word you're using on me. - Do you know what it means? - Hey, you know, you're getting better. Your reflexes are there, but your mind's still gettin' in the way. Remember, it's in the eyes, not the hand. Trust yourself. - I trust myself just fine. It's you I'm worried about. Gimme that thing. - Come and get it. - [Cody] Hand it over. - Take it. Come on, take it, take it. (groaning) - Give it to me! - All right, all right. - It's in the eyes. ("Once You've Tried It" by Anne-Marie Brown) * Once you've tried it * You'll never forget my love * Once you've tried it * You'll never forget my love * I think you'll go to bed at night * * And when you shut your eyes * I know who you're dreaming of * * You're gonna miss my love - [Ray] Get back there! - I'm sorry, I forgot. - You coulda had me busted. No topless within five feet of the audience. - I know. I just got so carried away with my act. - You do a very creative act. Some of 'em'll get it. Most of 'em'll think that you're trash. You gotta protect yourself. Use them. Don't let them use you. You come back late one more time from your break, I'm docking you a full hour. - Just try it. (sexy music) - What do you want? - Talk. - 'Bout what? - Roxanne. Look, I'm sorry about what happened. Do you think Roxanne's gonna be all right? - Why do you care? - [Cody] Because I'd like to be her friend. - Listen, people say they're friends after 15 minutes. Takes years. - Fresh from a tour of the Philippines and Guam, Fanny. ("Dream Come True" by Anne-Marie Brown) Whoa, what a talent. What a body. - [Brandy] Hey, Sunny here was just asking me all about you. Now you're here, maybe she can ask you herself. - I was just wondering how you're feeling. - Okay. Look, I forgot my music at home and I've got to run home and get it. Could you cover for me? - Sure. - Listen, maybe we can have a bite before work tomorrow. - I've got some things to do. - How 'bout the next night? - I don't have to be in 'til around 10. - Great, neither do I. I can catch a ride with you. - She's probably after your bod. - Well, in that case... * You are my dream come true. (tense music) (clicking) (tense music) (rustling) (clicking) - I'm a police officer. - That makes two of us. Well retired, anyway. Street cop for 15 years. You know, sometimes I still miss the bullshit. Pretty nice, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah. It's an original 1897. Look at that stock. That's heat treated to get that on there. - [Heineman] Let me take a look at that. - Ain't no fine blue like that on the modern guns. 'Beaut, huh? - [Heineman] Yeah. - Oh, I'm sorry. Paul Margolin. - [Heineman] How you doin'? - So, what do you want with Roxy? Poor kid's probably still locked in my bathroom. - [Heineman] Yeah, I wanna know where her brother, Eric, was night before last, between 1900 and one. - He was with me. We got stuck with a couple of Bruce Lee flicks. I got a (mumbling) TV. Pretty popular with the kids. - Feel like an idiot. - So you screwed up, big deal. Kid's probably too naive to know he can sue your ass. Anyway, that still leaves Roxanne unaccounted for for several hours. Boy, am I tired. - Well, you should be with all that dancin' around naked you been doin'. - I do not dance naked. (phone ringing) - Hello? No, she stepped out for a minute. Can I take a message? This is her partner, Sergeant Heineman. Yes, sir. No. Well actually... No, I did say that it was a homicide. I did say it was a strip club. No, I didn't realize that the regulation was that specific. If there was any kind of miscommunication, I'm sorry, sir. No, it's understood. She's outta there. Thank you, sir. Goodbye. Well, you can hang up your G-string. Rumor got to the brass that you've been dancing topless. - What do you mean, rumor? They gave me that assignment. - Well actually, you were assigned to go under cover at the Rock Bottom not uncovered. Just relax, okay, relax. You're not in trouble. The big guys think they're in trouble. They just want this whole damn thing over with. - You got me to dance naked. - You don't dance naked. - You bastard. (clanging) - You're really gonna hate me now. - What? - Well, you can forget about Roxanne 'cause I was just informed that Angel McKinney was raped. There's an APB out on Pocket. - I'll get dressed. - No, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait. Why don't you just relax, okay? Why don't you get some sleep? You've been up 'til three in the morning. Anything interesting happens, I'll give you a call. - I'll call you. - Ray, I gotta leave a few hours early. I've got a gynecologist appointment. It's the only time he could fit me in. - No way. - But Ray, I got this, kind of, yeasty thing. They think it might be contagious-- - Hold it, hold it, I don't wanna hear it. Just go, go. - Hey, Sunny. - Hey. (uptempo pop music) - What now? - I'm resigning. - But I was just getting used to you. - Is this your two-week notice? - It's more like my two-minute notice. - Brandy was just leaving. - [Brandy] Okay. - I was depending on you. - Look, Ray-- - You know, when I hired you, I took a chance. You said that you were reliable. You said you wouldn't screw me over, you remember? - But this is a little bit more complicated than I think you understand. - Did you lie to me? If you walk out now, you lied to me. I trusted you. - Tonight, but that's it. Why did you get into this business? - Money, I have trouble waking up in the morning, and I can't type. - What about the power? - Don't get me started on my aging stripper stories. You're not getting hooked, are you? - No, but it is interesting. And it's more than just going out there and turning them on. It's like something's cutting loose. ("Once You've Tried It" by Anne-Marie Brown) * Well you filled me with desire * * When we first met * You said one night stands were easy to forget * * When you kissed me for the first time * * You swore that it would be the last * * You were thinking you could run from love * * But you can't run that fast * Once you've tried it * You'll never forget my love * Once you've tried it * You'll never forget my love * Well you said it burned like magic * * When we touched * Put a spell on you 'cause I love you so much * * Got some good news and some bad news * * 'Bout the power that'll keep you near * * You can leave me any time you want * * But your heart is staying here * * Once you've tried it * You'll never forget my love * Once you've tried it * You'll never forget my love * I think you go to bed at night * * And when you shut your eyes * I know who you're dreaming of * * You're gonna miss my love - What the hell are you doing here, Cody? - Keep it down. - Fuck them. You were ordered not to come back here, and you are a cop. Don't flake out on me. (clearing throat) I'm her husband. - Sunny? - It's okay. They were counting on me. - That is really stupid. - I know. - Yeah. Well, they found Cinnamon. Dragged about 100 miles underneath a semi. Hey, it's over, Cody. Just let go of it, huh? (horn honking) Hey, we pulled in Margolin. Eric's alibi holds up. - What about Roxanne? - Oh, fuck Roxanne! Dammit, Cody. The night you got the job, Cinnamon fell off the stage. She gave Pocket a big wet one right on the kisser and the guy practically freaked. He can't stand being touched by live girls. He hates it. Now, the key is live. Get it? Paper flowers, dead ladies. I mean, you see where I'm going with this? Come on, our killer is a horny male and very sick. Now, you're wrong, okay? Now, just forget it, drop it. - I can't. - You're not interested in solving this case. You wanna take your clothes off in front of a million people. It's kinda like you datin' married men, isn't it? (smacking) Doesn't have to be real. - You're wrong. I want that son of a bitch. (weeping) - Come on, I can't deal with this emotional stuff. - Then make me stop. - How? - You're a cop. Figure it out. (melancholy music) I thought you didn't want to see me naked. (phone ringing) - Hello? It's Heineman. Hey, how many guys does it take to catch one degenerate, huh? Naw, I'm fine, man, just tired. Yeah, we worked all night. Yeah, I'm coming in, right. - Well? - Coming? (chuckling) - [Cody] Sorry. - No problem. - It wasn't what you expected. - Forget it. - [Cody] I don't know what's wrong with me. - [Heineman] You interested? - [Cody] Maybe later. - Afraid of being a woman. All those girls are. Why they dance up there in front of 100 men 'cause they're afraid to be in bed with one. When it gets real, you can't handle it. - Well, just when did you get so interested? How many men had to be watching before you decided you cared so deeply? - Hey, that's great, Sunny. Just bring me to my knees. Isn't that the point of being a stripper? - Bring you to your knees? Oh, you mean like, what cops do? Having people shit in their pants every time you ask 'em a few questions. - Yeah, right. Like what cops do. - Jesus, Heineman. You always like this first thing in the morning? - When a stripper makes a mistake, she just twists her ankle. Cops get killed. - What? You want a cup of coffee or something? Oh, God. I keep hearing this little voice that whispers Pocket is innocent. I gotta go back there. - Pardon me, but you're ordered not to. - Well, I'm just gonna have to deal with that. Look, Heineman. Heineman! I just don't buy it that a guy that's been hanging around there for years suddenly decides to start killing girls. - Hey, gotta start sometime. - Go ahead and lock him up, Heineman. Those girls are not gonna be any safer. - Yeah, I'm gonna prove to you that that son of a bitch is guilty and that you're nuts. - Heineman. - [Heineman] And I can't believe that I'm standing here listening to a cop tell me with a straight face that she's gonna quit the police force and become a stripper. - [Cody] That is not what I said. - [Heineman] Yeah, you go back to that club. That's what you said. - Goodnight! - [Heineman] It's morning! (tense music) - [Man] Is this real, man? - [Mobile Entrepreneur] This is real, man. - [Man] How much does it go for? - What do you got? All right, all right. Ow, ow, shit! Look, all right, look man, look, I know this ain't my territory. These guys just flagged me down, I sw-- - Shut up, shut up! (smacking) - Ow, shit, Jesus Christ. - I'm a cop. - Oh, shit. Look, this is not my car and this is not my stuff. I'm just making a delivery, I swear, ow. Ow! - Where's Pocket? - Who? - Pocket. Guy with the sweat shirt, you know, the earphones. Huh, knife tricks? - Yeah, all right, I know him. Yeah, he buys stuff from me. I got my clientele. Look man, you know some of these people, they'd have nothing without me, you know? They'd have none of the luxuries. But I don't know where he is, I swear it. - Look, why don't we go down the station and we'll run your luxuries through our computer? - Look, I still wouldn't know where Pocket is. I promise, I swear it. - What does he buy from you? - Cassettes. Just cassettes. (thudding) Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! - Of what? - Classical music. It's weird, huh? You know what he give me for 'em? Huh? - Paper flowers. (bell dinging) - [Shirl] We're closed. Use your computer terminal. - I forgot my access card. - Bull, you just couldn't go 24 hours without diggin' my vibes. - I wanna look at the records on the Bayer kids. They were runaways. - Don't suppose you have a year, case number, officers name, didn't think so. That's B-A-Y-E-R. Which reminds me, I have a splitting headache. - Thanks, Shirl. With Margolin vouching for 'em, I feel a little silly even asking. - Margolin? - Yeah, the ex-cop who alibied them. - If that's who I think it is, he's a story and a half. - What do you mean? (banging) Shirl, what about Margolis? - I can't get dip on this screen. Is the girl pretty? - [Cody] Who? - Roxanne headache. - Very. - 17 years ago Margolin was retired for blackmailing juvenile prostitutes into having sex with him to avoid arrest. Had a real problem with little girls. - Would he lie for sex? - [Shirl] That's what I said. - Why doesn't this show up in his records? - It was the same time half the officers in Hollywood were being rousted on a stolen property setup. Downtown figured they had enough bad press, so, they just quietly... - If Heineman shows up, tell him I'm on my way to Roxanne. (classical music) - We'll take a little walk, come on. Good boy. (thudding) (grunting) Good, spread 'em. Okay, son of a bitch. Go ahead, you resist. Continue this in a nice, warm hospital, that's fine with me. (panting) All right, put it back. Turn around. I said turn around. (classical music) Dr. Neville? Yeah, I've got one of your boys here. Well, he's got no hand. Grayish hair, he's got a Walkman, brown eyes. Murder and rape. Uh huh. Well, that's all I need to know. You're free to go. Wipe your mouth. (classical music) Hey look, can I give you a ride or something, huh? Looks like it might rain again. - Just like to watch the beauty in the dream. See, I took one in the hand. Had one... Ain't no touching left, just the watching. - Hi. I'm Sunny, a friend of your sister's. We're supposed to have a late dinner tonight. - She didn't expect you to show. She said you quit. - Well, I'm here. (tense music) (rustling) Margolin? - He wanted more, or less than I could actually give him. (tense music) (thudding) (grunting) Ah! (screaming) (tense music) - Freeze! Oh my. - Where have you been? - Let's see, at a concert. Damn. He show you his shotgun? - Say it. Well, say it. - You were right. - I was right and you were wr... - Don't push it Cody, huh? - Wonder what made her do it. (gunshots banging) - Me! Get back! - Let me go to him. - Shut up. (tense music) (grunting) When my father killed Mom, Roxanne promised not one person, no one can separate us. She was leaving, I had to stop her. - How many people do you have to kill to believe that bullshit? - All of you. (thudding) (gunshots booming) (grunting) (crashing) (tense music) (gunshots booming) (whooshing) Ah! (grunting) (tense music) Run! (thudding) (grunting) - Hey lady. Wanna buy this? (clicking) What's the problem? - Me. (thudding) (whooshing) (breathing heavily) (tense music) - Shit. Well, you got me here. (whooshing) - [Dazzle] Hey, where's our paychecks? - It's two a.m. Where you gonna cash it? - [Cody] Get down! (gunshots booming) (crashing) Stay down. (tense music) - Hi girls. - [Derek] What the-- (gunshot booming) - [Fanny] Hey, what's going on? (gunshot booming) (tense music) (grunting) (thudding) - I could have been her forever. Ah! (grunting) (thudding) Ah! (grunting) (screaming) - [Cody] Ah! (thudding) (breathing heavily) (thudding) (grunting) - Honey, get outta here! (screaming) (wailing) - Turn around slut, shoot me! Or I'll cut your fuckin' balls off! (screaming) (gunshot booming) (whooshing) (screaming) (whimpering) - Okay, it's okay. Hey, hey, hey. It's me, hey, it's me. (breathing heavily) Hey, hey. Kevlar. Wanna dance? Hey, you owe me a new coat. (tense music) - I can't feel my foot. - You're lucky. You got shot through the fatty part of your thigh. - My thigh is not fat. (weeping) (melancholy music)
