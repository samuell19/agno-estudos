(upbeat music) - [Man] Hey, Mr. Angelo. They locked you out the door again? (speaking foreign language) (pounding on door) (bottles breaking) (upbeat music playing) - Senor Angelo. Senor Angelo. - No, Juanita. I'm too tired. (gasps) I said tired. Not tired of you, just tired. - Want to buy, Senor Angelo? - Aztec dagger for human sacrifice. Where'd you get it? - My boyfriend. - Where did he steal it from? - Paco did not steal, he find. - Where? - None of your business, but he find more. Very pretty, too. Very, very pretty. - Well, I'm bad business right now. I only got $20 between me and starvation. (people chattering) Hi. - Buenos dias. Nada de nada, Senor Angelo. (phone ringing) - De Havilland Bookkeeping. Angelo, hi. What can I do for you? Money hassles? Huh. I'll pass you on to Mrs. De Havilland. - [Woman] De Havilland's. Bolder. A cheerful statement of importance. And bigger, I want the author's name to leap out. Okay? - Mrs. De Havilland. Cartagena. - Pass it on to my office. - Well, I'll be damned. The big boss herself. For a run of the mill bookkeeping mistake. - No such thing in the mill I'm running. Didn't you receive our last letter? - [Angelo] Which one was that? - The one saying you're fired. I also had the office forward you plane fare. If it doesn't get you home, at least it'll pay for your booze. - [Angelo] Maureen, why is it you always sound like someone just peed in your Jacuzzi? - I'm working deadlines here. In four months you only scratched out two manuscripts and the agreement was for six. I can't afford to have my associates suspect that I'm financing my ex-husband's vacation in paradise. - Your ex-husband was sent to write the history of the conquistadors with the storms. Why don't you just stab me in the back? - You had talent before you went to drink. - [Angelo] All I needed was one look at you to sober up. (dial tone buzzing) (upbeat music) - Let me guess. I bet your wife fired you at last. Right? - She trampled my pride. That's what she did. You can't take a third-class hack like me and turn him into a book dealer. No offense. 'Cause without you, I'd still be scribbling on my first manuscript. - Not that my help got you very far. - Well, it got me a lousy one-way plane ticket. Look at this. I get it from New York. Italy. - All the way to Italy? Well, that must've cost 'em more money. Why the generosity? - She's sending me back to my place of origin. Back to Mom. But I'll be damned if I let that bitch slap me up like this. - That means you're gonna cash in the plane ticket and stay, right? - I've got plans. Do it plans. This is gonna finance one of the juiciest dream-kissed reason that has frustrated mankind. - He who drinks without joy remains thirsty. - Ah, go to hell. (man laughs) - Money from New York? - [Angelo] Yep. The plane left without me. - Now you can buy my knife. - Why don't I just buy you? Juanita, do you have any idea how much your lover boy's stuff is worth? 30, maybe $40,000. - Dios mio. (upbeat music) (brakes squealing) Paco very jealous, Senor Angelo. You asked for a big cut. If he know you do this for me, he kill you. When he kill me. - No, he'll kill you. I'm only in this for the deniro. (camera clicks) - A fisherman's dream, senor. To net a Spanish treasure. - It's because I pray and Santa Maria answer me. - Si. - Did you fish this, too? - Oh, no, senor. I find it in the box with all the rest. - Maybe you can sell it, too. - Maybe, but you've gotta let me have it for a while. - You can't imagine what you've come across. This is Nicosia's diary. Now, if it was found here in Columbia, it means Nicosia took another route. You've just rewritten history. Congratulations. - Thank you. Big deal. - Well, is it possible you don't understand the finer implications? (laughing) - Nicosia. There you are, Professor. - Yeah. Thank you, my dear. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh, I was right. Balboa was plotting Nicosia's downfall. With the help of his allies at Darien, he sent Nicosia and his click back to Espanola upon a Caravelle that was poorly rigged. And the vessel was never sighted again. Do you understand what that means? - No. (chuckles) - It means that Nicosia, instead of heading north like is reported in this book, sailed east and then down the coast, and that's how these lovely objects found their way to Columbia. - Look, spare me the ancient history. Just tell me how I can set up a deal. - His name is Heinrich Holzmann. Emeralds like you've never seen. He's got the largest private collection of pre-Columbian gold. - Is he the paying kind? - When he's buying. But he's not gonna look at your stuff. Peddling state treasures is illegal. - Oh, he's that busy? - He's personally responsible for the physical elimination of about 80,000 Gypsies. In his youth he was known as The Butcher of Treblinka. - Is there any way to approach this gentleman? - Maybe. Through an antique dealer. (kids shouting) - Okay, okay. Here you go. - Listen, if you're gonna play the American tourist, you can buy me another drink. (laughs) - Catch! (kids shouting) - We found him in the lagoon, but he was dead before he hit the water. A heart attack. They tortured him. - Torture? - Yes. The work of professionals. - That doesn't make sense. - [Man] A friend? - He was the kindest man on earth. - People like him are very hard to find, senor. (upbeat music) (birds cawing) - La isla, senor. (motor humming) - [Man] Ted Angelo, Senor Holzmann's expecting you. - Every last piece has been photographed and cataloged. Yes, the state is fully aware of its existence and its value. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But I love to touch, to lay my hands to it. Run my fingers over the contours. They do not put beautiful women in museums. Why should we stow away our treasures? What did you say your friend's name was again? - Alonso Quintero. But he wasn't going to deal with you directly. He mentioned an antique dealer of your trust. - Your friend misinformed you. I don't trust anyone. (boat horn blows) (tense music) Mr. Angelo will be on his way now. (subdued music) - I still can't help thinking I'm responsible. - Who's holding the collection? - He thought I was. He went through torture for me. - Maybe he was killed for an entirely different reason. - It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense. - I'd still be wandering through the library like a lost child if it hadn't been for him. - You're a writer, too? - I'm preparing a thesis. White slavery in the reign of Izabella the Catholic. - Sounds fascinating. - You're lucky you said that. - Are you sure it was the same day I went to the library? - Positive. I gave him a lift that day. This is where he asked me to drop him off. I took off and didn't see whether he went into the shop or not. - Was he holding some old book? - Yes, a diary. Nicosia's diary. He showed it to me. He was so excited. I've never seen him so happy. Do you think the antique dealer's involved? - I'll soon find out. - Well, maybe I ought to go with you. What if you're gonna need a witness? - Take my advice. Stay out of this. Senor. Buenos dias. Christ. (upbeat music) (chicken clucking) (grunts) Who did you steal that collection from? - From nobody, senor. - Two people were killed. One was my best friend. - I swear, I fish it from the water, senor. - That stuff has never been in the water. Where did you find it? - On the mountain, senor. (Paco grunts) (birds chirping) (subdued music) If you're trying to kill me, just get it over with. - No, senor. You very strong. It's not so easy when you carry marimba. - They pay you good money for smuggling? - Si, senor. It's big business. The whole world smoke marijuana. Pays better than coffee beans. - I thought you were a fisherman. - Si. We are fishing for money. (laughing) This is where I hurt my foot. The others, they wrapped it, and they leave me here to die. But a storm come and then I look for some place to hide. (water rushing) Senor, this is the cave. (tense music) Nothing else here. I only find the treasure. - There's a draft. (tapping echoes) It's hollow. - It looks like a door. (tense music) (water dripping) (mysterious music) A ship. A ship, senor. A ship. Noah's Ark. (tense music) (water dripping) - 15th century gold. Nicosia's ship. - What is it doing in a mountain? (subdued music) Senor, let's go. Senor. Senor, where are we? (tense music) (tone pulsing) (ground rumbling) (tone pulsing) (ground rumbling) (horn honking) Senor Angelo, you tell me what we see up there. You tell me. - Money, Paco. Money. A big heaping pile of it. Either that or trouble if we don't play our cards right. - What you want me to do? - For a start, I want you to keep your mouth shut. Not a word of this to anybody. Not even to Juanita. - No. (engine rumbling) - Oh, Senor Garcia. (speaking foreign language) Doscientos uno Senor Garcia. (suspenseful music) - Escapar, escapar. They kill you. (tense music) (gun firing) - Garcia, no? (gun fires) (kids shouting) (guns firing) (gun firing) (gun fires) - [Man] You go down to the beach. We'll go up to the village. (dramatic music) (guns firing) (grunting) (chicken clucking) (speaking foreign language) (engine rumbling) (engine revving) (tires squealing) (gasping) (laughing) (yells) (Heinrich laughing) (grunts) (laughing) (grunting) (waves lapping) (laughing) (gasping) (tense music) (engine revs) (grunting) (engine revving) (laughs) (suspenseful music) (rock thuds) (gun firing) (gun firing) (tense music) (gun fires) (Heinrich yells) (monkey screeches) (grunts) - Excuse me. How did it wind up in a cave? - It didn't wind up. The spaceship is the cave. It probably got stuck in the mountain when it crashed. (grunts) - Keep still. (monkey screeching) Those men who tried to kill you, they knew about the spaceship? - Why else would they kill Quintero and the antique dealer? They're guarding a secret. - But how did they know the collection came from the cave? - They must've intercepted the diary I gave to Quintero. - Well then they know about the Caravelle. - Yeah. They know it's inside the spaceship, that it belonged to Nicosia, and that it's been there 500 years. - Gracias, Nan. (speaking foreign language) - Why are they so keen on keeping such earth-shaking news a secret to the point of killing people? - Holzmann could've answered that before he got packed away in salt. (phone ringing) - Si? It's New York. - Oh. - World Television. - Bob? Ted Angelo here. Listen carefully. Keep your wallet ready. I've got a story for you. UFOs really exist. - Hi, Ted. How's the local fire water? - Listen to me. Five centuries ago an alien spaceship intercepted a boat ferrying conquistadors from Panama to Espanola. It was Nicosia's boat. The spaceship scooped it up and then accidentally crashed into the mountain where it remained trapped for the next 500 years. It's still there. This is no bullshit. You can see it. Skeletons and all. - Have you fallen in love with that small-town whore who told you that tale? - No, I saw it. I saw it with my own eyes. I went inside a flying saucer. Send a team down to Cartagena and make sure they're good and well-equipped. This isn't a pipe dream, it's the hottest scoop of the century. There is even someone trying to kill me to keep it under wraps. - All right, you're not drunk. You haven't eaten any strange mushrooms. What's this cock and bull story gonna cost me? - [Ted] A hundred thousand. - That all? No kidding. All right, where do you want me to send them? - Hotel Caribe. I'll handle it from there. - You're playing with fire going back up there. - I'll be playing with fire wherever I go. I've seen too much. They're gonna try putting me in a tight-fitting box. A fitting box for two if we stay here any longer. - Try and see if you can walk. (uptempo music) (people chattering) - El Senor Barclay? - That's me. - Senor Angelo is waiting for you. Come, I show you. - Where? - Not far. I show you. - What's all the mystery? - Afraid of competition. Isn't this supposed to be the scoop of the century? (laughing) - People have been found hundreds of miles away. Just like that. From one minute to the next without any logical explanation. How about that bomber formation that vanished into thin air over Nepal? And the Bermuda Triangle? That's where Nicosia's ship was last sighted. - The one inside the flying saucer, huh? - The one that was here for the last 500 years? - Yeah, that's the one. Flying saucers have been around for centuries. Palini saw them in 83 A.D., but there was already talk of the Old Testament. Remember those references of flaming chariots in Sunday school, hmm? - Noah, right? The same guy who invented wine. - I see. The boss told you I'm a drinker. - A sponge. (laughing) (man and woman laughing) - Deep in peril in the Amazon plateau, the Incas dug trenches hundreds of yards long. Seen on the ground, they are perfectly meaningless. Just a lot of hard work for no reason. But from the sky, they take on the shape of a bird with open wings like a sacred message. 'Cause see, there are no mountains around. Who were the Incas communicating with, huh? (wings flapping) - [Paco] Come back here! Ow! - [Kid] Oh. (twig snaps) (upbeat music) (laughing) - The kid was hungry. I gave him a dollar. (harmonica blowing) How'd you two guys meet? - Oh, my wife, my almost wife. She work in Angelo hotel. - Does she know about the spaceship, too? - Oh, no, senor. Senor Angelo said keep mouth shut. - Here's looking at Senor Angelo. (tense music) - [Driver] Boss. - [Ted] Soldiers. Welcome to Cartagena. We'll run into a lot of them. - [Soldier] Your papers. This jeep, you rent? - That's right. - [Soldier] Out. - What's inside? - Uh, television equipment. - Mm-hmm. - Open up. - Thomas Barclay, San Francisco. Theodore Angelo, New York. - [Man On Radio] Okay, stand by. - Hey, I'm on television. - Not yet, man. - What's in there? - Lights. - Open it. Now that one. - [Soldier] Senor Angelo. - Yes? - You come here. You're under arrest, Senor Angelo. - [Ted] Why? What for? - The order come in from radio. - What order? For what? - [Soldier] For murder, senor. Two murders. - [Ted] But that's not true. - [Soldier] You can tell that to my superiors. (guns firing) - What the hell are you doing? (gun fires) (gun firing) (explosion booms) (uptempo music) (laughing) (chickens clucking) (laughing) (tires squealing) (horn honking) (laughing) (horn honking) Let him pass! Let him pass! (laughing) (horn honking) (laughing) (horn honking) Come on, step on it! Move this thing! (laughing) Move it! I don't want any! Move it! (horn honking) (man and woman laughing) Faster! (chickens clucking) (tires squealing) (laughing) (horn honking) (tires squealing) (uptempo music) (laughing) (yells) (explosion booms) (upbeat music) (people chattering) June! Step on it. - You're accused of murdering the professor and the antique dealer. The news reports said there was strong evidence against you. Details are being withheld until captured. - (scoffs) Even a murderer now. What next? - If they weren't working for World Television, who were those men? - Whoever they were, they were professionals. The Russian cartel. - [June] Your friend Bob sent them. You think he's Secret Service, too? - I think Bob knows when to censor classified information. - Why the coverup? What's there to hide? - You ever hear a politician talk about flying saucers, hmm? (horn honks) - This man is still on the run. U.S. citizen. He is responsible for the double murders committed in the city of Cartagena. He is still at large. Inspector Roberto, in charge of the investigation, says that the fugitive is still in the county. Anyone providing information leading to the criminal's arrest will be rewarded. Absolute discretion guaranteed. Dial Cartagena, 4-2-1-2 or 4-2-1-3. Tragedy on the Sierra Nevada today. A military truck with four soldiers and a junior officer flew off the road and into a canyon. There were no survivors. Police authorities blame the accident on a mechanical breakdown. - They would, wouldn't they? - Police, Secret Service, the army, they're all in on it. - You know what it means? I'll never reach prison alive if they catch me. - [Reporter] As on all official occasions, the who's who of the Soviet Embassy was on hand to enjoy the show. Since early morning, eager citizens gathered to watch the spectacular event. A large and well-disciplined crowd. Slogans and folk songs accompanied the grand parade. - Wait a minute. The Russian embassy voted. That will blow the lid on this. - Right. Once the Russians break the news about the UFO, what will the CIA care about you? - You got the idea. (subdued music) - What's the matter, Ted? - That man. I saw him before. I saw him on the island. He's the man who came to visit Holzmann. - A Russian? - Yeah, and a pretty important one too, judging by the company he keeps. - The Russians are involved, too? (knocking on door) (tense music) Quienes? - It's room service. It's fresh this morning, senora. It's muy sabrosa. - Thank you. You think he recognized you? (subdued music) - CIA, KGB. This is an undercover war. - This space wreck is really causing quite a stir. - The technology in that wreck could save humanity 2,000 years of research. Most of it military. - How did that Nazi Holzmann get Columbian treasure? - Mafia. The ship is in the Sierras, their territory. They're selling to the highest bidder. God, what a mess I got myself into. - We got ourselves into. (uptempo music on radio) Want a beer? - [Man On Radio] A farmer claimed that three flying saucers landed on his property for a half hour visit. The news sent shock ripples through the community until it was later discovered that the farmer had just recently been released from an institution for the mentally insane. - It's the last thing on earth I feel like doing, but I have no choice. (laughing) - Oh, Ted, a murderer? He wouldn't know which way to pull the trigger. - Will you help him get out of Columbia? - Sure. What do you want me to do? - Well, first and foremost, not a word to anyone. (siren wailing) - All right, Wednesday. I'll be there. Oh, and by the way, how are you two getting along? - Let's say we're just friends for the moment. (waves lapping) - Morning. - Good morning. You should've given her more time. Two days isn't an awful lot to find a boat and come all the way down here on her own. - Maureen's efficient as a machine. - Is that why you left her? - I met Maureen when I published my first novel. I thought I'd struck gold. She insisted on designing the cover. Being the boss' daughter, she got her way. But let me tell you, did she know the business. The book was a smash success. Our marriage, a crash failure. So, I wrote a second book, but it was even worse than our marriage. Somehow, I can't help thinking she's responsible. That she programmed my downfall the same way she launched me, efficiently. - And since then you've preferred your women fat and lazy. - [Ted] You're pretty efficient, too. - Why should I trust an Italian rogue? - Why should I shack up with some English lord's daughter with a back for Spanish history? - I've had to watch out for myself since I was 12 years old. - Did your parents divorce? - [June] A car accident. - Sorry. - I was supposed to make my own decisions from an early age. - So? - Well, when I see what I like, I make damn sure I get it. (subdued music) (uptempo drum music) (people chattering) (kids chattering) (phone ringing) - Yes? - [Ted] Maureen, it's Ted. Everything ready? - I've been ready since this morning. Where are you? - Santa Marta. How long will it take you to get here? - Before dark with this boat I found. - [Ted] You got someone to captain it? - Yeah, I've hired a sailor. He's been there several times from Florida. - [Ted] Oh, what is he, a drug runner? - No, no, he's not a drug runner. - Just the same. Don't tell him where the exact rendezvous is until you're on the way. Okay? Remember, Punta Tayrona. Be there. (singing in foreign language) (people chattering) - So, off to Punta Tayrona? - No, it's too soon. For now, we'll mingle with the crowd. That's it. (gun firing) (people screaming) (tense music) (gun firing) (grunting) (gun fires) (grunting) (man yells) - Russian? - Let me think about it. (speaking foreign language) (gun firing) (fireworks exploding) - This just can't be true. (uptempo music) (gears whirring) (woman speaking foreign language) (pounding on door) (tense music) (pounding on door) (speaking foreign language) - I can't. - He's a robot. - You think that's gonna improve the situation? (tense music) (metal slams) (gears whirring) (insects chirping) (metal rattling) (pounding on metal) (gears whirring) Oh, God. (insects chirping) (grunting) Help! (tense music) (pounding on door) (bull bellows) - A bull. - We're trapped. (bull bellows) (metal clattering) - Humpty Dumpty had a brick... (garbled talking) - [June] Who could've built a machine like that? - Not even the Japanese. - Well, someone must've made him. - Nobody on Earth, that's for sure. This thing is from another planet. - Carried over by a UFO? - Yeah. The governments are already in contact with the aliens, but us regular folks aren't supposed to know. That explains why despite all the radar and satellites, neither the Americans or the Russians have ever officially spotted a UFO. (gasps) (water lapping) You won't believe what I'm gonna tell you. - I see you've been having fun. - It's been hard enough staying alive. - Okay, Jose. - Buenos, senora. (tense music) (electricity zapping) - You're losing your touch, Maureen. You're just as trusting as that fool you married. - Don't be so modest. You've managed to make quite a nuisance of yourself. I had plenty of reasons to kill you when you were my husband. I never thought I would do it now. - Are you out of your mind? - Why? - UFOs don't exist because none has ever fallen. You had the misfortune of coming across the one and only. (laughing) - You too, huh? Just like Bob. Only, how do you fit into the conspiracy? Why shouldn't the people know we are in contact with the extra terrestrials? Why are the extra terrestrials keeping it a secret? - They made them, didn't they? - I told them they were all brawn and no brains. - Told who? Told who? - Here's one last token of my appreciation, Ted. (tense music) (liquid squishing) (sighs) We were here before you Earthlings learned how to battle. We need your planet. It contains a rare element that's indispensable to our spaceships. For 12,000 years, ever since we've began exploring this solar system, yours has been our last supply stop. For centuries, we've had no problems. You were few and stupid. But then you multiplied. Your civilizations developed. Your ships began to explore even the most distant shores. Avoiding you became impossible. Your evolution was a threat, so we took measures. As you've seen, we're mutants. We have been infiltrating your ranks for centuries. We govern you. Every key position on your Earth is occupied by one of us. We influence your decisions. We are the ones who are really in control. And when the time comes, we'll be the ones to push the button. - Where is Maureen? What did you do to her? - She's right here. You're looking at her, sugar. (grunting) (sighs) You still taste good, Ted. I am partial to your flavor. (gasping) (gun fires) (breathing heavily) They'll find you. You don't stand a chance. (liquid squishing) (birds chirping) (typewriter clacking) - This is sensational, Ted Angelo. Too bad it'll never get published. - Let me finish it first. One step at a time. Don't forget that I saw the one and only. The truth has fallen. Maybe one day another will fall right in the middle of Times Square in New York and the world will know. (mysterious music) (upbeat music)
