Before we begin, I have a question. Who here is an economics major? Okay. You all know I'm a popular professor, right? There are so many students who want to take my class, but I can't accept all of them. Can you drop the class for them? - Excuse me? - Drop my class. - That's a bit... - I mean, can't you leave for students with other majors to take this class? If I drop this class, I can't enroll again. Right. Okay. All right, think about this. As you see, young musicians and artists who led the so-called "Hongdae Culture" were chased out of the area when Hongdae became popular. They moved to Yeonnam-dong, but had to relocate when the rent rose. When all seemed good at Mangwon-dong, they were chased out again because of Starbucks. All right, how do we solve this problem? Hello. Isn't that too thin? It's 50pi, so it'll be strong enough for most things. Do you know how much the projector weighs? A 20,000 lumens projector weighs 47 kilograms. With the brackets, it weighs 52 kilograms. It's how much I weighed this morning. Should I step on it? We checked that already. Everything will be ready on time, ma'am. The quality is what's important. Yes, ma'am. Ms. Min, what is this? It's Zhou Zhang. Zhou Zhang? I thought we dropped that. I talked with the director about this. Isn't that enough, then? Good work. Director. DIRECTOR LEE HWA-LAN. Wouldn't it be better to just go to court than give up the ranch? You can request alimony separately, so that would be the best choice, but... I'm absolutely sure Yong-seok is cheating on me, but he doesn't have any loose ends. - What is it? - I saw that a Zhou Zhang came in. Zhou Zhang is nice. People would go crazy for one of his pieces. We already chose the pieces for our new artists exhibition, and the press announced it already. Really? I guess we'll need a new article. Director, the reopening exhibit is about showing our center's direction, and... So why is the vice director having issues, when I find the direction fine? Just stick to your job. You must think you'll become the director as soon as I get promoted to chairwoman, but not anyone can be a director. Did you know Zhou Zhang was coming in? I just heard about it a minute ago. The reporter, Ms. Yoon, called. Are you going to Alt Space tonight? All the artists who worked on the reopening exhibit are coming. But the problem is that we can't just suppress the housing market. That is the pressing problem with reform. Professor, when will the reform take place? People are about to get evicted, and you're saying they should just wait until then? Wait a minute. It really is a problem that rent has risen to unbearable levels. Well then, is there any practical way to resolve this? Professor Jang? They should pay the rent. What? They should pay the rent. Are all landlords evil people? They have a chance to make profit through real estate, How can we stop them from raising rent? I get what you're saying, but the thing is that in reality, paying rent is extremely difficult. We can help them pay. How would that be possible? A civic bank could offer low-interest and long-term loans to small business owners to help them pay rent. Professor Jang. Small business owners are getting chased out right now, and we're having a serious discussion here about how to protect the rights of our citizens. - This far-fetched... - You're right. Tenants are citizens. But landlords are citizens as well. Of course, there is a difference in their wealth, but both are citizens that require protection. We have to focus on mutual benefits while coexisting. All politicians think about is which side they should support to get more votes. Isn't that why they can't find a practical solution? He's pretty harsh. - Isn't he charismatic? - Our citizens achieved things that the US and Finland couldn't. Forbidding desire is totalitarianism. And letting desires go wild is laissez-faire. But encouraging reasonable levels of desire, is the responsibility of a civic society. Oh, thank you. - Thank you. - I'll see you at school. - All right. - Take care. Excuse me, Professor. Do you remember me? Were you my student? I took your class before, "The Birth of a Civic Capitalist." I didn't know I'd see you again like this. This is how we meet after students graduate. You mentioned during class how a civic bank was necessary, and you're actually doing it now. We'll have to see. Thank you for today. I'll go to the rally tomorrow. Good luck, sir. - I'll get going now. - Bye. Ma'am, you really came. I didn't think you'd come. I heard the rising artist exhibit got cancelled. Gosh, this is so embarrassing. I already told everyone about it. We're here today to congratulate the opening of Alt Space, - so hold it. - I trusted you. Cheers to Alt Space! - Cheers! - Cheers! I wanted to do something like this too. Congratulations. You know Zio Shin, right? He was invited to the Documenta. Yes. I thought he was in Paris, though. Right. He's just here for a short while. It's something about a dance collaboration. Why? Do you want an introduction? It's fine, maybe later. The weather was nice, but it's raining now. "Alternative space." That's a really tacky name. But it takes quite a lot of courage to call it "alternative" himself. Is it true? About Zhou Zhang? I need your help, Ms. Yoon. We're buying three pieces from him. One is getting sent to a Paris auction. - The sponsor? - Hwayoung Group. Another conglomerate story? It's a bit clich√©, and there's no evidence. How about abuse of power? They suddenly backed out of the contract, and they took away opportunities from local artists just to invite a foreign one. So you won't even drink with losers like us? How ridiculous. If you're a mysterious artist who doesn't even do interviews, why are you here? You should greet a senior artist if you see one, you shit. - What's up with you? - You know - that I'm not usually like this. - Of course, I do. It's okay. I'll take him. - Stop. Come here. - How could he do that to me? - Come on. - I was just... - I didn't mean... - Let's go, come on. What an asshole. The past love. Becomes a thorn. That digs into me. I ask it to leave. To leave for good. But still, it keeps bothering me. Don't you know women hate men singing that in karaoke rooms? That's why I'm singing it at home. I missed you like crazy. Why did you do that? If you sing with that on, you'll get wrinkles around your mouth. Gosh. Maybe I should just quit work. What is it this time? Those who do whatever they want with their money... I hope they die. That Ms. Min. She'd be nothing if it weren't for her money. While I was looking at Chun Kyung-ja's pieces on a calendar, that bitch had the real pieces hung on her bedroom wall. Unbelievable. Are they expensive? Should I buy one for you? Can you afford that? Hey, I'm doing pretty well. I was on TV again today. Weren't you just assisting Professor Lee again? It's not like that. No one helps me out as much as he does. I heard he's quitting to go into politics. That's why I should stick with him. - You want to do politics, too? - There's no reason not to. If the time comes, and if there's an opportunity. I believe you won't lose an opportunity if it comes to you. But I... I prefer a man who makes a chance, not a man who waits for one. Someone who makes their opportunities... You're here. Yes, hello. Do you know how much one cc of this boy's semen costs? It costs the same as a one-carat diamond. Whether it's a person or a horse, the bloodline is important. PRESIDENT'S AWARD HAN YONG-SEOK GRAND ART EXHIBITION OF KOREA So you've visited Germany. Was it nice there? Nowhere is like how it used to be before. Nothing moves me. But still, you're amazing. You make art even while you're so busy. It's not time that bothers me, it's my lack of physical energy. I should do a piece with you sometime. "Abuse of power from large galleries. Local artists cannot find places to exhibit their pieces." This article was your doing, wasn't it? It's fine since the name "Mirae" wasn't mentioned, right? Don't underestimate Hwa-lan. She's not the director just for show, you know. Please let me become the director. You want the director's seat? What's in it for me? A partner you can trust. I'm a pretty good partner. Trust me with that role. If Hwa-lan heads the foundation, wouldn't you become the next director anyway? You're the one who gets to decide. Out with conglomerates that kill small businesses! - Conglomerates, back off! - Conglomerates, back off! Get rid of political corruption and help the dreams of citizens! - Get rid of corruption! - Get rid of corruption! Professor Jang. Sir, you're here again. Why don't we have a drink later? Could I borrow your lighter? Here you go. Hold on, I'll get you some coffee. - Back off! - Back off! When the hell will the reform be in place? We want practical measures! - Practical measures! - Practical measures! Protect the rights of small business owners! Citizens... Fire! He's on fire! Someone help! He's on fire! Oh, no. What do we do? Oh, my goodness. Sir, are you okay? Sir! He saved him. Is Ms. Lee still the same? She's still clueless as always. Except when she bullies me. It's amazing that you're still working for her with your temper. What else can I do? I have to earn money and pay off my debt. Why do you live like that? You just had to go to Gangnam, even if you could only afford to rent a house. Your fibroids grew. Let's check again next month. You're at the age where premature menopause isn't uncommon. Hey, I'm only 37. That's why I'm saying this. 37 isn't a young age. It won't matter if you don't want a baby. I'm healthy, and I'll have a baby after some time. Here. - How is Tae-jun? - He's busy. He must be doing well. He bragged that he was on TV yesterday. - During a rally about the rights... - He does appear on TV often. A man of age 73 attempted to burn himself to death. Professor Jang Tae-jun, who was at the site, threw himself over the man to save him. Won't it leave a scar? What did the doctor say? It's fine as long as I take good care of it. Don't do things like that again. Even if we ever break up, I really wouldn't want to be a widow. That's a bit harsh. I just don't want you to get hurt for some stranger's sake. He wasn't some stranger, I knew him. That doesn't mean you really know him. Always so meddlesome... How could I just stand there and do nothing in that situation? Hello? Yes, that's right. The Republican Party? THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR THE PEOPLE HEAD OF PARTY'S OFFICE Is your hand okay? I hope you weren't hurt badly. Oh, it's fine. What do you think is the value of a conservative party? Excuse me? It's practicality. Practical policies that will help improve the lives of citizens. The civic bank idea, Professor Jang. I was very touched. Thank you. Let's work together to make that civic bank. And we'd like you to run in the election for our Party. You have great insight, sir. It's not easy even for a presidential candidate to be this popular online. What do you say, Professor Jang? If you give me the opportunity, I'll do my best. I'll look forward to working with you. Sure, thank you. The piece you mentioned last time, I got information that it's going to be auctioned in Hong Kong. You're buying another piece? Ju-yeong likes Hopper's works. Wow, he's different from kids these days. He looks just like his father, but his artistic sense is just like mine. You have to be born with artistic sense. About 800 million would do it, right, Curator Oh? Oh, have you forgotten that she's the vice director now? She's been so for a while. I don't see what the difference is. Don't say it like that. - Is it that different? - Of course, it was a promotion. I must have drunk too much coffee. Where's the bathroom? Oh, I'll show you the way. "Artistic sense"? How ridiculous. She can't even tell apart Gogh and Gauguin. I'll get you that piece for 1.2 billion won. I just want that piece to find an owner that deserves it. She just said 800 million. I can never get that for that price. One billion, then. I'm doing this because I don't want that woman getting that piece. You're really good at this. But I want that Takashi piece you have in exchange. How much can I get for it? Four billion if it's auctioned, and five if you give it to me. You really are something. When can I come get the Hopper piece? Just sign the certificate I send you, and we'll take good care of it. But isn't it funny to buy a piece for a billion won and not even look at it? Ma'am, did you look around all the land you bought in the suburbs? You have a point. How did it go, Tae-jun? See you later. Did something good happen? Yes. - What about those women? - They left a moment ago. They're always going around in groups, gossiping about useless stuff. They're so uncultured. Will she give us the Takashi piece? I think she might. I read the article. What would you gain from going against me like that? I'll take responsibility and take care of it. You'd better not mention that rising artist exhibit again. If you don't find a decent artist for the exhibit, this is going to be your last exhibit. So think carefully. What? Really? Zio Shin said he'll work with you? It's not confirmed yet. You're unbelievable, how could you come up with such an idea? Who would want to work with the woman who dumped him? Why mention something that happened ten years ago? I better go. I thought interactive art fell out of popularity. I guess the artist is what's more important. What's your agency? I don't have one. You need one to exhibit your work in places like Mirae Culture Center. I'm not interested in places like Mirae. The name sucks, too. In Korea, strange places with weird names are the ones with authority. So you are not willing to display your work in Korea? I heard you rejected a billion won offer. I don't like people who start talking money right from the start. Right? That's a bit tacky. Let me be frank with you. I want you to be the main artist for our reopening exhibit at Mirae Culture Center. Is that offer a personal one? I don't work like that. You don't want some? CIVIC BANK'S 1ST ACCOUNT Get closer to him and talk to him a bit. All right. Sir, how are you feeling? Pardon? It seemed like he told you something. What did say? Well... He thanked me. He said that the civic bank must succeed. Thank you, we'll make sure it succeeds. - Can you get me some water? - Professor Jang. - Yes. - Let's take a photo together. - All right. Thank you. - Smile. Okay. FOR THE PEOPLE Jang Tae-jun for the Gangnam District. - Hurray! - Hurray! That doesn't suit him. How about this one? Okay. Make sure that's lined up straight. - Okay! - Okay! Number two, Jang Tae-jun. - Go! - Go! I'm Jang Tae-jun. Hello. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. - I'm Jang Tae-jun. Wow. Gosh, ma'am. - Gosh. - Take a photo. I'll take that for you. - Thank you. - Let's go. Mr. Jang. Mr. Ahn isn't here. You shouldn't just come in like this. I came to give him the list of supporters for tomorrow. You could've called me, why did you come here yourself? I'm not used to this kind of thing yet. You know we have a meeting, right? Let's hurry before we hit traffic. Okay. I'm Baek Gwang-hyun. I entered law school in '99. I met you once when you were working on the school paper. - You can talk to me casually, sir. - Oh, right. Nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you, sir. Please have a seat. - All right. - Here. I heard from Mr. Ahn that you're thinking of around 3 billion to get started. Oh, it's 30 billion. What? The loans will be in small amounts, with low interests, so I think we'd need that much to able to earn a stable amount. Is that a bit overwhelming? No, it's fine. Mr. Jang, I'm not here to negotiate. Whatever you say, you'll get it. Is that so? "Daeil." The company was named to mean, "against Japan." I named it to respect my grandfather's part in the independence movement. Wow, he's very admirable. I'm putting my trust in you, then. Thank you for trusting me. - Mr. Oshima is here. - I'll be there soon. I'm sorry, but give me a moment. I'll be right back. All right. He seems pretty nice. He sponsors our Party often. I think he could be a politician too. He's gentle and good with words. But I believe you'll be a better politician, since you're brave. I was very touched that day when you ran over to the man on fire. No one knew what to do, and you were the only one who rushed over. That was nothing, it was just instinct. Someone was dying, you know. They say that what you do in such situations is who you truly are. You're different from other people. Oh, right. - What's this? - It's a bribe. A bribe? That means you want something in return. Buy me a drink sometime. Do you have feelings for me? I haven't seen that before. It's a congratulatory gift from the Party. It looks a bit cheap, though. It does? But still, the Party gave it to you, so you better wear it. Politics is about the cause, not fashion. You know, I think you might do better than me at this. The road to the Blue House is open, you know. Are you just going to stand there and take photos? You're getting way ahead of yourself again. Getting ahead is how you win. Let me see. I think we look pretty decent today. You're right. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Thank you for coming. - Hello. - Hello. - Senator, thank you for coming. - Hello, Mr. Jang. - Oh, hello. - This is my wife. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello, Ms. Oh. - This is my husband. - Hello. - Hello. - It's nice to meet you. There's one of the women I talked to you about. Oh, the one who kept talking about Hopper? She's looking, just smile. Let's do it. Hello. I'm also a huge fan of Edward Hopper's works. I heard a piece was hung in President Obama's office. - You know Hopper? - Of course. You have a great artistic sense. Hello, ma'am. Hello, Ms. Oh. - Thank you so much for coming. - Sure. - I'll see you again soon. - Yes. Hello. Who... I'm Mr. Jang's political aide, Park Eun-ji. I heard you were his student. You're quite a beauty. I'm Jang Tae-jun, her husband. I'm Zio Shin. Oh, this is the man you wanted to do the exhibit with. It's nice to meet you. I heard she's making a lot of effort to lure you. I see my efforts paid off, seeing how you've come here. I hope you work with her. She's putting everything into that reopening exhibit. There are many people like her. But the wine is so expensive, it's hard to pity them. Is that so? I know landlords have divine authority these days, but I can't afford to do business while paying such expensive rent. Since this is a sponsorship event, many people ask me this. "Which account should I send my money to?" Don't donate your money. Invest it, since we'll make you a profit. I heard that this is very expensive wine. Think of this as our investment to gain many great investors. Let's have a toast for our cause! Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! Mr. Jang, you're so good with words. You look like a politician now. All thanks to you, Su-yeon. Mr. Jang, our Party leader is waiting for you upstairs. Really? Okay. I'll see you later. Eun-ji. Why don't we have a drink together when this is over? Don't you see I'm working? You're here. Hello, sir. Let me introduce you. This is the new face of our Party, Jang Tae-jun. And this is... This is Mr. Nam Kyu-sik, the CEO of Angel Venture Investments. It's nice to meet you, sir. All right, sit down. Please have a seat. Sir, Mr. Nam here agrees with our cause, and he's decided to invest in it. An amount of 10 billion won. We really needed someone to step up first for our cause. Please, don't. Actually, I haven't decided for sure yet. We just can't do this openly yet, but let's do it properly. This is for a decent cause, so I'm sure he'll think this over positively. All right. Let's all have a drink together. - Have a drink, sir. - Cheers. Why did the free school meals policy work? It's simple. It's something that parents who have packed lunches can relate to. "Why would you stop such a decent thing, you jerks?" That's what people should say about it. We have to do this the simple way, nothing complex. Why do politics the hard way? I thought he was a teaching dweeb, but he's a wolf. So, did you make up your mind? I'm not sure I can work with you. Don't be like that. Just stop by the center sometime. How about next week? I'm going to Paris. I have an exhibit. Do you want to join me? This suits you well. Have you ever done it with a congressman? I'm doing it right now. Did you overdo yourself last night? How can you become a congressman with that energy? They don't get elected based on their physical stamina. What's going on, though? You can hardly wake up in the morning. I thought I should work out a bit. And spend some time with you too. Did things go well last night? Nothing will get in my way. Aren't you being too cocky? Why? I thought you wanted a successful husband. You reek of alcohol. Let's keep exercising. - Come on, let's exercise. - How much did you drink? Wait for me. What about the parents? We scheduled campaigns targeting women's clubs. Education is an important subject, so I want to put a lot of focus on it. We already contacted reporters, and... So we're preparing live broadcasts on Facebook and YouTube. Okay, then I'll do the speech tomorrow morning. - Okay. - If there's nothing else, I'll head off. You still have a lot of time before your dinner appointment. I have somewhere I need to go first. Would you join me, Eun-ji? Sure. I'll drive, sir. I'll drive myself. One glass is 1,000 won? He sold drinks by glasses, saying some people didn't have the money to buy a bottle. I hope he gets better soon. You can become a congressman and take care of him. So we're putting up a banner with no names of any artists. People will think we're not announcing any names on purpose. The auction will go smoothly, right? It's Ms. Min's first time doing this, so make sure things go well. I'll go to Paris, Director. Ms. Min's family company branch in Paris promised to send people to help. Don't you think we should be careful about conglomerates nowadays? It's a sensitive issue. I believe a professional should handle this. Well, it's true you've never made any mistakes. I think this area is okay, so just organize this part. Yes, ma'am. Let me talk to you for a minute. Does it have to be now? I'm busy. What happened with the Paris business? It's your first time, Ms. Min. Don't you think it's better for me to do it? Why are you doing this? It's just money laundering! Yes, you're right. But you need a name value to do it right. I guess you have nothing to be afraid of. Why? You thought only plutocrats have no fear? You should think about other things too, not just about making your breasts bigger all the time. ZIO SHIN PHOTO EXHIBIT. - How do you do? Pleased to meet you. - Thanks. How about you guys take a selfie together? One, two... - Is this good? - Yes. Thank you. Bye. Take a photo with me, too. Why aren't you getting married anytime soon? I should at least stay single to meet you like this. Here you go. Don't film me. Stop that! - Stop it. - Why? Come on, stop it. Come on. - Don't do that. - Stop it. Stop. Stop it. The main piece for today's auction is Zhou Zhang's Tears Of a Dragon. Bidding will start with 1.7 million euros. Three million. Four million? And 4.5 million. Five million? Six million? Six million. Going once... Seven million for the gentleman. Eight million for the lady. Nine million. Ten million. Ten million, going once. Ten million, going twice. Ten million, going three times. Sold for ten million euros. Congratulations, ma'am. We will proceed to the next piece. Next is a painting by Michael Coren. We'll start with 950,000 euros. Hey, what's going on? You must be Zio. I am. Thank you. All right. Su-yeon, please contact me again next time. So you two made a 100-million-won painting get sold for 10 billion? The one who sold the painting was in on it, too. So that deal left us with 10 billion won. That means you're embezzling that much money from the company. Can the company run properly? The company has the picture. The Zhou Zhang we bought for 10 billion. We'll display that at the center a few times, and then get a loan of 10 billion with it as mortgage, since it's a 10-billion-won painting. I just did a huge deal, so I'll treat you today. How were things recently? Oh, yes. Good news... Mr. Jang, what are you doing? Come on, join us. Come over here! I was preoccupied for a minute. Let's drink to Mr. Jang's election! - Cheers! - Cheers! HEY, EUN-JI. GOOD MORNING. I'M WAITING OUTSIDE TO GIVE YOU A RIDE. - Let's hurry. - All right. We should have breakfast before we go. Excuse me. Ms. Oh Su-yeon? You're under arrest for violating laws regarding foreign exchange and specific economic crimes. - Wait a minute. - Zio. I'll handle this. She's very pretty. And you are beautiful. And you have a great personality. Did you have dinner? I'll eat when I get home. How was Paris? Is there a problem with the picture I bought at the auction? That's for a slush fund, isn't it? Raising the price that much would leave at least eight billion won. A picture's value increasing means that the curator has a great artistic sense. - You keep records, right? - Of course. Records of our members, the transactions, and the art pieces we have. Our center is very meticulous. Not things like that. Secretive records. Ms. Lee of Daewon Group bought a Takashi on her wedding anniversary. A daughter-in-law of Sangjin's chairman wanted a trade. Ms. Yang wanted a nude painting. And Ms. Lee Dong-jin wants a painting to hang in the bedroom. Anything by Peter Doig. The Prosecutor General only wants one of his. That's all I know. And you were doing business with Zio Shin? I'm preparing an exhibit with Zio Shin. Ma'am, one minute, please. A JUST PROSECUTION FOR CITIZENS You can't do this. He's her husband, which means he's involved. Besides, he's a politician. This could lead to a huge scandal. It's Jang Tae-jun who's come to me. Don't worry, and get that pretty Ms. Oh some dinner. Oh, gosh. I was excited to hear that a rising politician was here. Prosecutor Cho Yeong-seon of the Seoul Central District. Oh, it's nice to meet you. I'm Jang Tae-jun. What did my wife do wrong? You didn't know? Ms. Oh is a professional at making slush funds for the wealthy. And at amounts up to several billion. How could a culture center curator make money like that? But you made several billion, too. The fund for that civic bank you're preparing, I know it's a lot of money. You're starting with 30 billion won? This is how I think. I guess this is why people call me a nut case. I'm actually more interested in you than your wife. The suspicious connection between Mirae Group and the Republican Party. The connection between Mirae Group and the Republican Party? When Ms. Oh launders black money and makes it clean, you make the civic bank with it. Isn't that how it goes? That's what usually happens in movies. I don't think that kind of imagination is a skill you need. It's a reasonable suspicion. You can't detain someone based on suspicion. The Korean law lets us detain people for 48 hours based on suspicion. I thought you'd know everything since you're a professor, but I guess you don't. Did you actually think that you became a candidate all on your own? You really are a nut case. Did you get a warrant? I think I need to look into this. I told you not to get ahead of yourself. Let her go right now. Your husband already has as many connections as top politicians. Excuse me. Could you get me some water? The Party is pretty sensitive about this. Any scandals before the election could cause trouble. We just met, and that's what you say? I'm just saying, be careful. Tae-jun. You've changed. No, I haven't. I'm just making an effort. Do we really have to hear things like slush funds and money laundering? You could just quit working for that center. I can earn enough without you doing dirty work. - "Dirty work"? - If I knew what you were doing, - I wouldn't have let you. - You didn't know? Are you stupid? This is ridiculous. Don't cross the line. You're mistaken about something. I decide what to do with my life. You think your ambition is some great dream, but mine is nothing? You're a wannabe congressman, but you have no respect for the law. Stop picking a fight. I don't think it's just because of the center. But I don't know what they're after. She talked about the Republican Party, then Mirae Group. Anyway, I've been to the Prosecutor's Office, so I'm qualified for a wife of a congressman now. Let's raise it. I can see it has every element of a hot art piece. First, the piece has to be large and expensive. - And it... - It has to be hard to understand. I guess you know since you're an international artist. Is everything okay? I learned all this in school, but I can't remember anything. That's what you filmed in Paris. Why would you suddenly withdraw your investment? I'm just a powerless businessman, but I can't waste my company's money anymore. Don't say it like that, sir. Investments from businessmen like you are necessary for the civic bank to have a good start. - Investments? - Yes. I've already given enough for the slush funds. We're not a conglomerate, I can't just give 10 billion won. Chairman Han can get that money easily. Why make smaller companies suffer like this? You just want us to be the scapegoat if something goes wrong, right? I guess it was a mistake coming here. But you tell Mr. Ahn this. I won't just stand by if he sends people to scare me again. Wait... Don't film me. Stop that! Stop it. Yes, I took some medicine. No, it's not that. I know the date. Okay, I will. I'll stop by after work. All right. There's a guest here to see you. Tae-jun cheated on me? Do you have evidence? Pardon? Photos, voice recordings, videos. Anything like that. No, I don't have anything like that. I was just worried about Eun-ji and Mr. Jang. Really? So, what did you actually come here to say? Are you telling me to keep my husband in line? Why don't you leave now? Mr. Jang. About that thing you asked me to look into. - I looked through the list of graduates. - Yes? But there was no Baek Gwang-hyun. There were some with the same name among other years, but none of them were in law school. Daeil is registered as a loan company, and it's connected to gambling and prostitution. I'm sure it's not just a normal company. Mr. Nam said he'll withdraw his investment. What did he mean when he said you sent people to bully him? What are you talking about? Hey, do you even know what you're implying right now? And there are many suspicious things about Mr. Baek. Hey, Mr. Jang! We have enemies everywhere. You know that? Don't get swayed by nonsense, and make sure you know your side. You have responsibilities. You have to keep your focus. I'm going to check if there isn't anything fishy about the companies that are investing. That's my responsibility. He's really going to cause trouble. Hey! Stop bringing those inside. I'm already annoyed as it is. Do you think this is a botanical garden? I gave them the hospital address, but they keep sending them here, saying they hope he recovers soon. Nonsense. That man who put himself on fire is irrelevant. We need something fresh! Do you like Tae-jun? Excuse me? He's a pretty decent man. But you almost ruined that decent man's life. Let me give you some useful advice. When there are still some guys who want to sleep with you, find a nice guy and hold on to him. Or else girls with mediocre skills like you will live a difficult life. What brings you here? I don't know where you heard some nonsense to end up here, - but you're mistaken. - Mistaken? Have I ever made you upset about something like this? Did I ever say anything to you about something like this? - I'm sorry. - About what? Are you sorry about cheating on me? Don't fool yourself. I don't care about that. - Hey... - But don't get caught by anyone else. If you ruin your life, it's going to affect mine, too. You sound just like Hillary. Exactly. So, have an affair when you become like Clinton, not now. They launder money through the center and blackmail companies for money. And they empty citizen's pockets by offering high-interest savings. Some of that is given to politicians as hush money, and the rest is invested in paper companies made beforehand. Then it goes bankrupt, and everyone loses their deposits. The government must then give 50 million to each person as compensation. As civil servants, we can't sit and watch while the government loses money. That seems exactly the same as the Busan Savings Bank case. They've just changed the name. And plus, they're emphasizing their noble cause, talking about gentrification, so there's no one criticizing them. That Jang Tae-jun, though. His profile doesn't really suit this kind of thing. Whether he started knowing about this or not, he'll become a congressman thanks to that civic bank. - He won't be able to play innocent later. - Never mind that. Aside from Mr. Jang, you know who's behind all this, right? CIVIC BANK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, MIRAE CULTURE CENTER Han Yong-seok is a conceptual artist who makes intangible things into objects. His works of art are radical. The inspiration he gets as an artist... Add "infinite" before "inspiration." The infinite inspiration he gets as an artist comes from... Comes from... She says, "It's nice to meet you. I'm Minami." I can understand that much. What do you think is art, Minami? Come on, interpret that. "Something beautiful." Art is shit. Is that funny? Yes. Oh, what is it, Mr. Ahn? What are you doing? Hold him. - Is that enough? - Bring him here. You were happy to invest that money. Do you think you can just say you've done enough and back out? I wasn't ready yet... That's your problem, you shit. Why did you agree when you weren't even ready? Gosh, that hurt. I'm taking one, and two. They're all mine. How was it, sir? I accidentally hurt my hand, damn it. You really have a strange hobby, sir. What about Jang Tae-jun? Don't worry, we're meeting together with Mr. Ahn tomorrow. Tell Mr. Ahn that Mr. Nam is taken care of. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT The Republican Party... Sir. Were you awake? It's you, Professor Jang. Yes, it's me. Candidate number two, Jang Tae-jun. Is my pub taken care of now? Your pub? What do you mean? They said they would take care of the rent and everything if I set myself on fire. I did everything they told me to, so tell them to keep their promise. You said it's a cultural foundation. It seems like a charity foundation to me. Do you even know what art is? I see art on Instagram. What cheerful bullshit. I mean it. I have hundreds of artist friends. Then why are you here instead of living in the States with those friends? Move. I need to think some more about being the director. That son of a bitch. The director? The board will decide soon. It's out of my hands. Does the chairman know about this? Is there something you discussed with him? He called Jason here himself. You should've known whom to suck up to. God, this is suffocating me. This goddamn thing. Mr. Park, come massage my feet. Yes, ma'am. I'll do a three-level massage. I'll begin with your metatarsal bones. What are you doing? Aren't you going to leave? E-MAIL FROM MIN HYUN-AH Ms. Oh, this... The woman is so annoying. She's fussing over this fucking lousy center. Hold that fucking lousy center and shake it up. I thought you'd get me something nice. When you're ready, I'll get you something bigger. Turn around. It's better to get a used one for your first car, since you'd scrape it and crash it. So you're saying running the center is just for practice? Lie down. Yes. Dad, are you exercising? Get out. I meant you. Get out. All right, let's turn over a new leaf and focus on the civic bank. That's why I invited you here. Sir, you heard something strange from Mr. Nam? There were several strange things. Did you pay the man who set himself on fire? My company, Daeil. It means "Great Japan." I named it like that after my grandfather said useless hate toward Japan will only ruin Korea. Why don't you try this? It's nice. That old man was always sitting in the front of the rally. He got the money to pay his rent, so it turned out well for him. We take care of things neatly without any legal problems. What? Are you familiar with knife laws? It's very difficult to get permission to own katanas, but this doesn't apply to that law because it's just a kitchen knife for cutting sashimi. By the way, Mr. Jang. Which parts do you like? I like the Achilles heel. If you stab the stomach or the chest, you could serve 20 years. But... stabbing the Achilles heel isn't that serious, since people don't die by getting stabbed there. It might be hard to go jogging, though. Do you still go jogging every morning? With your sexy wife, Su-yeon? Are you threatening me? Come on, don't be like this when we're here for a good cause. "Threatening"? You're so clueless. Coming out. I'm revealing my true self. We're close friends now, aren't we? I should support you properly, like family. Come on, look. Look at that. Don't you feel like it's waiting for you? You should get in there, don't you think? Congressman Jang Tae-jun! That sounds great. Now, let's drink together. Come on, drink with me. Here... You think using money is bad, but selling your body is okay? This USB can hold up to 30,000 books. And about 2,000 photos. I wonder how much video it can hold. It was pretty long. So what are you going to do with it? You're still a snob, Su-yeon. What would happen if this gets out? Your husband would go back to being a professor. You might not get divorced, but I guess you might get into a huge fight. It's so strange. Why are you always rallying against conglomerates? I know you envy the wealthy. Listen, Su-yeon. Only the wealthy live without fear. You shouldn't be the same, you should have fear. You should be afraid of me, and Hwa-lan as well. Okay, I'm going. I said I'm going! Fuck! Shit, that's disgusting. Hey, are you okay? Stand up straight. Come on, don't fall down. Look at this. What's this? Take-out? All right, let's go. Come on. Hey, don't stare at me like that. I like you. You said you wanted a civic bank. Things will be so easy when you become a congressman. Don't you think so? Stop touching my nose! What do you think you're doing? Let me go! You're a bunch of sick thugs! That bullshit about being my junior... All you know is how to use sashimi knives. You just got knocked down by a kick in the knee, you losers. What? You take care of things neatly with no legal problems? Everything you do is so sloppy! If you take care of things so neatly, how would I know this? I know you made that man set himself on fire. You're all dead if any reporter gets this information. - Get that? - I told you that's never going to happen! Hey, you. Fuck you, asshole. Why are you swearing like this? You son of a bitch. Go to hell, you fucker. I'm really good at swearing, you know. That Congress badge isn't even real gold. It's silver, and it only costs 35,000 won. - What the... - I know that, you little shit. Damn it. The Republican Party... is fucking damned now, you suckers! God... That crazy idiot. It's cold, let's talk inside. I just met Ms. Min. What did she want? She wants me ruined. I'm sorry. "Sorry"? That's a useless word. If the video gets out, I lose my family and my work. You could just run away to Paris, but not me. Let's leave together. To where? Paris? I'm not leaving. I have no intention of running away. You said you weren't happy here. You can't even love someone freely. Go look at the video. Go see how dirty that love seems. Goodness. INCOMING CALL JANG TAE-JUN Su-yeon! My amazing Su-yeon. I told you I'd make you happy, right? I have tuna sashimi. I have the best parts. You love this, right? I'll hurry home with this. Okay? But where am I? Where is this place? I'm sorry to call you at this hour. WE SUPPORT THE CIVIC BANK What are you looking at so intently? It's nothing, sir. I heard you're the one who called Jason. You said I'd be the next director. Of course, it's your turn. You've done so much until now, right? And we're partners. I like things... that are certain. Certain? Yes, I like that, too. Ms. Kim! Mr. Han, let's talk for a minute. Be quiet. Art is not made with words. Wait. Please. Make sure you get good shots. I've caught you at the scene. They say there's no law against adultery anymore, but that's criminal law. Why don't we figure out how much compensation you'll pay in a civil suit. You bitch. I guess you succeeded today. You should be ashamed of yourself. You can't even get it up. Just not with you. I'm doing well with other women, you bitch. Mr. Jeong Shin-woo, who set himself on fire in front of the National Assembly Building died around 5 a.m. today. The cause of death is assumed to be the incident's aftereffects affecting his heart disease. Mr. Jeong's... There's a press briefing in 30 minutes. What briefing? Mr. Jang, how do you feel right now? This way, sir. - Mr. Jang, please give us a comment. - Mr. Jang. The press briefing will begin in 30 minutes. - Mr. Jang! - Please give us a comment. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HEAD OF PARTY'S OFFICE You surprised me. Your timing is perfect. I was just about to find you to get complimented. - What? - I took care of things really neatly, just like you said. You bastard! Unbelievable. You idiot. - It hurts. - I'm supposed to be a thug, it'll be embarrassing to get beaten twice. Don't you think so? What kind of professor uses such violence? THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR THE PEOPLE The civic bank project began with Mr. Jeong's sacrifice, but I don't think it's going well right now. Starting today, we're holding off the project temporarily. First, I want to find a new, better way to proceed in honor of Mr. Jeong. That will be all. Mr. Jang, what did you mean when you said it's not going well? Is it the official position of the Party? What will happen to the civic bank project? I owe you a lot this time, Su-yeon. Don't say it like that, Ms. Lee. You sacrificed yourself and played the lead of a crazy drama. Good work. An article was added to guarantee you the position of director for at least five years. You've finally become the director of Mirae Culture Center. CO-DIRECTOR JASON HAN You're the director. Jason is the director, too. You're co-directors. I don't understand what you mean. When you came to me that night and suggested tricking Yong-seok, I was a bit surprised, to be honest. I just thought you were that desperate for the position. But why did you suggest having Ms. Min be the vice director when you didn't even like her? It seemed strange. So I called her and asked. The piece is sincere, I like it. I heard a rumor that Professor Jang had an affair with his student. And his wife had affairs with the culture center artists. People love gossip like this, couple sex scandals. Jang Tae-jun keeps acting out of line. That's going to cause us trouble. So Su-yeon, talk some sense into him, okay? It wouldn't be nice for your husband to see this video. The relationship between a husband and a wife is precious. Stop the bullshit. Hey, I look forward to working with you. Can't you even eat by yourself? Hey, watch your mouth. If you've eaten enough, why don't you leave now? Since you earned lots of money, you could pay the bill. Close the doors. So what will it be? Honestly, I'd prefer to have you on my side than him. Jason isn't even my son. But no matter how hard you try, you can't beat a single drop of Yong-seok's blood in him. You know that, right? And you know that the reopening exhibit is important, right? So I think... It'll be hard to exhibit Zio Shin's pieces, don't you think? Let's cancel that, okay? - Then... - Zhou Zhang. It'll be better to stick to the original plan. You'll help out, won't you? Oh, right. I have a copy of that video as well. I probably won't have any use for that, but you never know. Why do people film that kind of stuff when they have no intention of showing others? Those two people might fight over money, but they'll always be on the same side. They could fight violently inside the house, but they'll never let their money seep outside their walls. They're different from people like us. Are you sleeping? Yes. Should I stop doing this? Why all of a sudden? It's just... It's just a bit hard for me. If you're drunk, get some rest. We'll talk tomorrow. Okay. ZIO SHIN If you want to change the order, just choose the folders like I showed you last time. I don't think we can do the exhibit. I'm sorry. I should be here until the end. Did you know that suicide attempt was the Republican Party's doing? What will you do if I knew? You should have told me. Professor, when we were taking photos in the hospital, what did Mr. Jeong say to you? Did he even say anything? Sir, how are you feeling? Pardon? Give me some water. It seemed like he told you something. He thanked me. He said that the civic bank must succeed. The Party that manipulated the whole incident, and you, who used that to become a star, and me, who was desperate to keep my place. We're all the same. Now that I think of it, those people were at least honest. Yes, you're right. I'm so pathetic. I made all this stupid fuss just to become a congressman. But still, there are lines that you shouldn't cross. You might ignore someone who's dying, but actually killing someone... That's crossing a line. Mr. Jeong didn't just die. They murdered him. I really do want to become a congressman, but I just can't work with people who murder others. What can I do to help? SECURITY LOCKED ID CARD SECRETARY PARK EUN-JI This is evidence showing that the Republican Party made illegal funds using the civic bank project. If this gets out, the project will be shut down, and it would affect the Party as well. And Mirae Group, which tried to profit from the bank, won't get away unharmed. And it might affect you, too. Hey, how do you have so many followers? - It's not that many. - It's awesome. - Let's take a photo together. - One, two, three. One... This rice wine fills me up, and it's cheap, too. It's a great drink. What do you want? Money. Money? Money. Right, you need money to campaign. All right, I'll give you money. But you should put people before money. People who have everything never pay for their meals. The ones who want something should come and pay for it. I'll give you some pocket money. And keep these records, instead of cutting ties with me. I'm not making deals with you. I give you those records, get my cash, and go home. How much do you want? Thirty billion won. That idiot. Don't go overboard. Just give me that money! You're the one who went overboard. I don't negotiate. Do you see that? "Fixed price. Cash only." He got the spelling wrong. Do you think they're the original documents? Would that jerk act like this if he knew about his wife's video? This is nice. This is why people have insurances. They could get bitten by a mad dog someday, or their pet could become a mad dog. Hey, Director Oh. That video... What are you doing with the lights off? This is the original. If they don't answer by tomorrow, I'll send this to the prosecution and finish them once and for all. Those dirty assholes. I'm now a director. Would you congratulate me? Congratulations. So. Stop this. - What? - Stop all this. Did you even hear what I said? I heard you. But if you mess with Mr. Han, that puts me at risk, too. Didn't you think of that? Is your position that important? Yes, it is. You becoming a congressman is important, too. Su-yeon. Just look at this first. This has nothing to do with us. What are you talking about? Thousands of people will get hurt if I don't do anything about it. Is that so bad? It's fine as long as we aren't harmed. Stop that. If you say anything else, I'm going to be disappointed in you. "Disappointed"? How can you say that? Do you think life is easy now since you had a congress seat handed to you? Do you even know what lengths people go to to get such a position? No matter how hard I try, I can't spot an old man setting himself on fire. Oh Su-yeon! That old man died, okay? Don't you get it? - They killed him! - That's what I mean. If you mess with Mr. Han, do you think you'll get away with it? Who do you think you are? I'd rather get killed than live as his slave! What about me? I've worked so hard to get here! Let's just keep living as his slaves. You're crazy. What do you think you're doing? Are you crazy? - Yes, I am crazy! - Let go. Stop it! Damn it. Do whatever you want. Are you filming me? Don't film me. Stop that! Oh Su-yeon. Come over here. Open the door! Open the door, Su-yeon! Su-yeon. She didn't tell you she had fibroids, did she? No. She felt a lot more pain than others. She should have had surgery treatment, but she just endured it with medicine. What do you mean by surgery? Removing the uterus. But then she'd have to give up pregnancy. She is not interested in having a baby. She is. She might not have told you that, but if she wasn't interested, she would've had the surgery. Su-yeon isn't in a good state right now. I guess they serve food to visitors too since this is an ob-gyn ward. I made a mistake too. And you let it slide, so I should do the same and let it slide, right? I'll be cool with it. But you know, Korean men aren't cool. And I am a Korean man to the bone. Should we get divorced? No. I don't want to. I'll pretend I didn't see this. At least we can be happy together. I know you're not at an age to worry about your later years, but you should at least have some buildings bought under your children's names. Other people seem to like cars and buildings, but now that I'm older, I prefer nature. I want to get an island. I have several in mind in Namhae County. You really have excellent taste. Packaging the savings bank as the civic bank was a great idea. I was worried since using savings banks was becoming too common. And people seemed pretty interested in the civic bank. The good thing about this nation is that everyone feels they're lacking. Nobody thinks that they have enough money. Everyone jumps at the chance to earn more, even if they have to go into debt. Jang Tae-jun won't be a problem, right? The good thing about this nation is that everyone feels wronged. Nobody is satisfied with his or her place. Everyone believes that their place is at the top. Jang Tae-jun can't teach anymore since he's had a taste of power. That's the power of this nation. Everyone wants what people around them have. It isn't just Korea that's like this. "You shall not covet your neighbor's wife." It's written in the Bible. Mr. Jeong, Mr. Ahn, welcome. This way, please. Here they are. Zhou Zhang... Let's look at the next piece. What's this? Jason, what's going on? This is different from the rehearsal. Gosh. What's happening? What is that? I wonder what that is. It's our turn now. Are you okay with this? Yes. What about you? If you're okay, then it's okay with me. Let's go. Are you filming me? Don't film me. Stop that! I'll film you. Look at me. Come on. I wanted to succeed. I wanted people to know my name, and I wanted to be the director of this huge culture center. That desire gave me the energy to come all this way. So for this culture center's first exhibit, my first exhibit, I chose to display this piece that showed my desires. Don't. Stop it! Come on, give me the camera. Give me that. Give that to me. Oh, my gosh. I was blackmailed because of this video. I was afraid. I couldn't sleep, thinking about how much I could lose. I spent so many nights awake, and when dawn arrived, everything became clear to me. I was the one who held myself back. Not the ones blackmailing me. It was my desire that stopped me from letting go and moving on. I want... to find myself. I want to find freedom for myself. I own my desires. I will not become a slave of them. Do you think that I'm crazy? You might point fingers at me, saying I'm shameless. But... I'm not ashamed. I'm proud of myself. I'm proud of myself for being shameless. You got a delivery, but there's nothing written on it. PROSECUTOR CHO YEONG-SEON. Mirae Group's transfer receipts, mortgage loans... They seem to be loan applications from paper companies to the civic bank. This isn't the original copy. Jang Tae-jun is a nut case too. Mr. Han Seung-hoon. Mr. Jang Tae-jun. CIVIC BANK FOUNDATION CEREMONY Mr. Lee Jung-ki. Lastly, please give a round of applause to Chairman Han of Mirae Group, who donated 30 billion won for the civic bank. Is the suspicion about Mr. Jeong's death true? Tell us about the incident. Are you refusing to answer? Do you admit to making illegal funds? I will answer everything truthfully to the prosecution. - About Mirae Group's... - Give us a comment, sir. Is that right? You're really something. You even gave up becoming a congressman. We received the documents you sent. But we noticed that you left out some important parts. You're not going to send the original, right? If everything gets out and the civic bank project gets canceled, what good will it be? Even if it's black money, isn't it better to use it for a good cause? Are you admitting to the crime? Mr. Han, give us a comment. - Mr. Han! - Please give us a comment. - Mr. Han! - Give us a comment! - You're admitting to the crime, right? - Give us a comment, Mr. Han. Just a moment, please. I was so upset since I had no evidence to lock him up, but I hit the jackpot when I searched his clubhouse. He'll at least be in jail for assault and attempted murder. Mr. Han! Please say something! Mr. Han! You really are... a nut case. I don't see Director Oh Su-yeon here. She went to work. But not as the director, though. Ms. Kim.
