He's only 6 years old. Oops! Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. Was there a big yellow bird On this plane? Well, only me. Oh, too bad! Maybe he'll be on the next plane. Yeah, next plane! Say, you must be the Dodos! Yeah! Yes! I'm Daddy Dodo. I'm Mommy Dodo. I'm Donny. And I'm Marie. Who are you? Why, I'm Big Bird! What?! No, you're not! You're Big Dodo! Yeah! Yeah! Big Dodo? Look, Big Dodo, This is our street, Canary Row. Where are we going? Where are you taking me? Is this the airport? Here we are. Well, we made it. I told you I could find it. Find what, dear? I... Can't remember. I'm so proud of you, father. Thanks, son. It's great to be here. You have to come home before you can leave. Here we are. Don't be shy, Big Dodo. Whoop! Ha ha ha ha ha! Gee whiz. Bird would be so proud of me. I've watched his things all week, And nothing has moved. Come on, Barkley. Cheer up, boy. We miss Big Bird, too. Oh, hey, look, everybody! A letter from Big Bird! Big Bird! Come on! Everyone come on! What's he say? What's he say? Uh... He starts, "Dear friends..." Uhh. "Here I am in my new home. "It sure is a lot different "From my nest on Sesame Street. "The Dodos are a nice family. "They live in a birdhouse with a big front lawn. "They spend a lot of time there digging for worms. "They never seem to find any, but they love to do it." Gee, I don't see any worms here. "The Dodos have lots of great things like a lawn mower you can ride on." "I'm not sure they know how to use it right, "But nobody's perfect. "The Dodos like to stay in shape. Every morning, we do our exercises." Come up off the floor, And start jogging in place. Left and right. Yippee! Yippee! Look at me, Mommy. Yippee! Whoo-hoo! I'm getting tired. Don't stop, Daddy. Pressing it down. I need a rest. Four more. Hold on. Three more. Come on. Get tough. Two more and... Cross your hands in front. "Sometimes, after a hard workout, we take a dip in the pool." ♫ By the sea, By the sea ♫ "Now, that's fun." Aah! Aah! "Well, it's time to go to sleep now." Well, uh, good night. Ohh. Ahem. "So that's my new home." Night. "I should be happy here." "What's wrong with me?" "Love, Big Dodo"? Big Dodo? "Big Bird to you." Oh, dear. Sounds like Bird needs me. I know. I'll write him a postcard and ask if it's ok to come visit now. Hmm. Hey, I've got a great idea. Let's play make-believe. I'll be Snow White. But you're not Snow White. You're bright yellow. Yeah! Well.. and you could be the Seven Dwarfs. But we're not dwarfs. We're... Birds. I said we just could make believe. You know, pretend, Use your imagination. Oh, ok. I'll pretend I'm Donny! And I'll pretend I'm Marie. Ha ha ha! Boy, this is swell! I like this game. What a great time! Get the door, Marie. No way. Uh-uh. Go on. Get the door. Get the door. Go get it. Nope. Uh-uh. Don't be stubborn. ♫ I'm not gonna get it ♫ Get the door, Marie! Never mind. I'll get it. Oh. Hi, Mr. Postman. Post card for, uh, Mr., uh, Big Bird. Big Bird? Hey, that's me! Oh, boy! I wonder who it's from. I don't know, but I hope He's not sending you any packages. Oh, yeah! Bye-bye! Let's see. It says, "Dear Bird." That's me. It goes on. "I am ready to come and visit. Your best friend, Mr. Snuffleupagus." Oh, Snuffy. Who's Mr. Snuff.. Snuff.. Snuff.. Snuffleupagus. Yeah. He's my best friend. What kind of a bird is he? He's not a bird. He's a Snuffleupagus. Snuffleguppygus. Snuffleguppygus. But your best friend should be a bird. Why? Because you are a bird. Isn't that right, Daddy? That's right, Mommy. You should be with your own kind. Birds! You'll find lots of birds your own age. And make some new best friends. Now come on out and hunt for worms. But I don't want to hunt worms. I want Snuffy to come and visit, and if he can't come and visit, I don't want to be here anymore. I want to go home. But you are home. Ha ha ha! There are varying opinions all through the west on this subject, However, most agree Congress will make up its mind about that sometime next year. Now, the weather. It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood. A beautiful day for a neighbor. Would you be mine? More on that later. This news just in Concerning a 6-year-old runaway. The runaway's an 8-foot yellow bird Who answers to the name Big Bird. Did you say Big Bird? That's right, Big Bird. He left his nest in Oceanview, Illinois, last night And is reportedly heading east for a place called Se-same Street. Se-same Street? Sesame. Sesame. Sesame Street. Sorry.

The note reads, "Dear Dodos, you are a very nice family. "Thanks for everything, "But I'm walking back to Sesame Street. "I should be there in three hours "Since it took two hours to fly here. "So if anyone calls, "You know where to reach me. Love, Big Bird." And here is the family that he left, The Dodos. Are we on television? Yes, you are. We finally hit the big time. Let's go inside and watch. Now, who'd run away from a family like that? Uh... Uh... They.. they certainly look very worried. Ah. Dodos, be careful there. Watch it. Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen... The Dodos. And, uh... They certainly are. One green froggie. To complete the picture, Let's have a few words with Miss Finch of The Feathered Friends. Excuse me, Miss Finch. You sent Big Bird to the Dodos, didn't you? Yes. I found him a lovely home. And why was that? Because he belongs with his own kind. What kind is that? Birds. Hmm. Yes. Well, Why do you suppose he ran away from home? I can't imagine. Quiet! Such a lovely home. Such a lovely family. We at The Feathered Friends Take such pride in finding the right environment for homeless birdlings. You think maybe he didn't like it here Or something? Impossible. Hmm. Well, what are you going to do About it, Ms. Finch? I'm going to find Big Bird, wherever he is, And bring him back to the Dodos. Well, you heard it right here, folks.

Don't worry, I'm sending you bear-mail. See you on Sesame Street. Ah! Telly, it's gonna be all right. Oh, Olivia. I'm so worried about Big Bird. Well, don't! He's out there all alone, and Miss Finch could get him. Not if we find him first, and believe me, Telly, we will. Isn't that right? Yeah! All right, listen, everybody. Here's the plan. We're here... And Big Bird is here, Heading toward Sesame Street. We hope. Ok. Gordon, you're going to take the volkswagen On this route here. You got it, Bob. Linda, you go with Gordon.

That's right! How brilliant. Here it comes. I'm afraid this isn't working, Snuffy. For hugging, you need the real thing. Oh, don't worry, Bird. We can hug for real when you get back to Sesame Street. If I ever get back to Sesame Street. But I will! Uh-oh. Snuffy? Snuffy? I guess I got to go now, Bird. Bye-bye. Snuffy? Snuffy, Please don't leave me. What's that? Oh, no. Could that be Miss Finch?

We've been open 5 hours and No suckers have showed up yet. You must have done something wrong. What about them darts? Did you rig them? Yeah. I put lead weights in the tips of 'em, So when you throw them, They go right into the ground. What about the invisible gorilla? Did you print up those disclaimers? Yeah. I printed up a whole batch of 'em, But what difference does it make? We got no customers. Sam, we're washed up. Hey, maybe not. Check the gams on that butterball! Hi. I'll take care of it.

They had a little car trouble. Tell us about your trip. I had such an exciting time. You know, I was on this big farm. There were two little kids there, and they were really nice, and I was helping them do things, and then suddenly, I looked up and saw... Miss Finch! Hello, Bird. Perhaps the Dodos weren't perfect for you, But I have managed to find you another lovely bird family. He doesn't need another family. Uh-uh. No, no! No, no, no. He has one right here, and we all love him. Right. For sure. That's right, Big Bird! But he's a bird. He'd be happier with his own kind. We're all happy here On Sesame Street... And we've got all kinds. We've got people... And cows... She's right about that. And we've got... We've got Bert and Ernie... Yeah. We want you here, Big Bird! And there's dogs... Ruff!

Yeah, that's right! So you have. And you're all happy? Yeah! Yes, we are. Yes, definitely. Well... You did go to look for him, So that must mean you care. He does seem to have Lots of friends, not feathered, but... All right. Big, from now on, Sesame Street is your home. Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Thank you! I've done it again. Placed another stray bird in a good home. Case dismissed. Back to work. I wonder where Snuffy is. Would everybody excuse me for a few minutes? I've got something I should do. Excuse me, ok? See ya. Bye, Big. Snuffy! Snuffy? Oh, Bird! Oh! Oh, Snuffy, this time you're real. Oh, Bird, Can I stop watching your things now? Ha ha ha! Oh, Snuffy. Oh, Bird. Ah... Home at last. I hope nothing's seriously wrong with your car. I hope not, either, but I can fix it. Oh, Gordon! Never in my life... Gordon, what's going on? What happened to your car? Gordon... Gordon! What happened to the car? Don't ask me, ask him. Hi. Excuse me. Our insurance man won't believe this. Ruff ruff! Once more around the block, Bruno. Sure, boss.
