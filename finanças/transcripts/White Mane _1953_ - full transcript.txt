CRIN-BLANC White Mane Toward the south of France where the Rhone spreads its waters into the sea there exists an almost uninhabited region called La Cavaque where some herds of wild horses live. Crin-Blanc was the leader of all these horses. He was a fiery and fearsome horse to whom the other horses obeyed. Crin-Blanc did not like human beings. He knew how to confront them when necessary. But one day humans decided to capture him. And on that day started the story of Crin-Blanc among the humans. One day a little fisherman boy called Fofo met Crin-Blanc for the first time. Crin-Blanca was really a wild horse. He felt that humans were besieging him. the herdsmen continuously came back to search for Crin-Blanc. - There he is the herdsmen were happy to find Crin-Blanc but Crin-Blanc was determined not to be caught again - Here is your hat, sir! - If somebody is capable of catching this creature I will present it to him - To me also? - Yes, to you also. But before you catch him , both your fish and you will have grown wings. Fofo was sad because the herdsmen mocked at him, but at the same time he told himself: If I catch Crin-Blanc he will be mine Crin-Blanc was a wild horse. And even though he liked the little fisherman very much, he liked more to run freely among the other horses - I told you he would come back! In the meantime another horse took Crin-Blanc?s position of the leader of the herd. But Crin-Blanc was not in the mood of accepting this. The herdsmen were determined to find Crin-Blanc to show him that humans are always the strongest. - Hey you, go away from here!! - The only way to bring him out of there is to burn the whole marsh. - Has that boy become nuts? - Hurry up, he is heading towards the delta! - He has to be stopped before he reaches there! - What are you doing? Come back! The current can take you! - I will present you the horse! Only come back! - Come back, boy! - Are you crazy? Come back! What are you doing? Come right back or the current will seize you! - Come back! Return! But the little fisherman wouldn?t listen neither to the herdsmen nor the people. They would have lied to him. And together with Crin-Blanc he disappeared taken by the waves In sight of all the people who were there they both swam all straight ahead and Crin-Blanc who has great strehgth bestowed on him took his friend, the one who had trusted in him to a country where horses and men have always been friends.
