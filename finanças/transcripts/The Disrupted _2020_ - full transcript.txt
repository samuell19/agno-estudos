- Cow boss, cow boss, cow boss. Cow boss. Cow boss. Cow boss, cow boss. Cow boss. Cow boss. Cow boss. There ya go. - I want everybody to know, I asked everybody to come over here. Like all of you guys, I appreciate in different ways, man. You know what I'm saying? 11 years is a long time. Built a bond. I told Jerry earlier, two P's kept me coming in here. The paycheck and the people. And this is the people right here. We gonna do a little shot. Good luck to everybody. Everybody got a little something? - Everybody got a little something something? - I'ma get a little more, man. - This is to fuck 3M right here, baby. - Fuck 3M! - Fuck 3M. - Yeah, I second that. Fuck 3M. Hey, they tried to tear us down, but we gonna show them how we rebuild. Stronger. - New beginnings. - Stronger than ever. - I love y'all! - God bless everybody. Definitely. - Bottoms up to the bottom! - To the lips, to the gums, look out stomach, here it comes. - Woo! - I'm sorry, Pete. - God bless you. - Take care of your children. - Long time, baby. - Yo, Pete. - All right, bro. - It was eight years. - It's been real, guys. - Yup! - You gotta go hog wild a little bit, too. - Yeah, just a little, just a little. Just a little. See that's what I like right there. Look. The man just lost his job and said I'ma be all right. Bought himself a $40,000 truck. Confidence. - That's either bravery or stupidity, one of the two. - I call it bravery. - Who's still at the airport guys? I'm on my way there. Is it slow out there today? - Hey Cheryl, I ain't got nothing all the way from Lakewood. If I don't get nothing before I head to the airport, that's where I'll be. - Cheryl, I've been here since nine in the morning and I'm at number eight. - You're kidding, right? You're joking with me. What, that's almost five hours. - Freddy, who did you say only made $100 in 100 hours? - LJ, she has a hundred and something hours and she only made $200. - I made no money on Saturday, from five to nine I made 50 bucks, that was it. I finally get down to St. Pete and holy crap, crushed it. - Hey guys, so where are you parked at? I'm getting ready to come around the curb right now, coming into the airport. Oh, where's everybody at? Look, sleeping. See? Sleeping in the car. People come out here and they park and they just pass out. That's how many hours they've been on the road. Their cars are running, they're sitting in it, and they're snoring away. So, right now I'm 40 drivers in the queue. I got 40 drivers ahead of me on Uber. And on Lyft, I'm still 100. Yup. I'm on. - I'm not even in the queue, yo. This is why I don't stay here, because I have no reception. So how am I supposed to get a ride? - Well, and then the guy over here, he just said, "I went to the bathroom." He put his phone in his pocket, went to the bathroom, and got kicked out of the queue. Start all over again. - Oh, yeah. I get kicked out of the queue every time I go into the bathroom. - This is ridiculous. - See, nothing, no bars whatsoever. - The streets are terrible today. I've had one ride on the streets today, that's it. - Is that you? - Oh, yay, somebody finally got something. - Navigating to pick up Peter at door three. - All right, I'll see you later, John. - All right. - Good luck, hope it's a long one. Waiting, waiting, waiting. We wait, and we wait some more. This job is very addicting. Very, very addicting. It's almost like gambling. One day you make a lot of money, and then the next day you think, oh god, the next day I can do this again. Well, it don't work like that. It just doesn't. First couple years, I made lots of money. And then, these companies start slashing rates. And they kept slashing, slashing, slashing the prices so we're down half of what we used to make. I don't know. But I love it. See? That's where that addiction comes in. But I love it. Oh, what I gotta, oh, my god. Hey, I'll be back. You may still be sittin' here. - Yeah, yeah. Our great-grandfather Godfried Martin bought this farm and home in 1904. And so, what you see around us is five generations of history. I mean, even great-grandpa Godfried's pocket notebook that he kept notes in, this is 1891. I mean, this is agriculture of a different era. These are wool cards for stringing out the wool to get it ready for spinning. And then this, anybody want to take a guess what that is? - Mm, no. I can't, I haven't the slightest idea. - That's for darning socks. You know, it's a bunch of old stuff. None of it's valuable on the market, but Grandma instilled the history nut in me. I mean, on our honeymoon, Kathy and I followed the Santa Fe trail out to New Mexico. I mean, I've always been a history nut. You feel a lot of responsibility and obligation to your ancestors, and so as farms consolidate and are absorbed by larger farms, you know, there's this sense of not only letting down yourself and your family but your ancestors, and that's hard to deal with. I lost almost a third of the operation this year. The way the bank looks at it, you had your run and then sell out. It's over. I can sell half the farmland and be out of debt, but by God it's mine and I don't want to give it up. - Welcome to the conference group. Please enter your passcode followed by the pound key. - Well, the next thing is, I was on a call yesterday, and Chelsea said that their goal was to have states notified by September 8th. - If we're gonna focus our grant on, on the farm crisis response again, this would be our, our best route to go. I always said I'd never work off the farm, but that's what I'm doing. And my salary is key to keep our farm going. - Go to Colby on the 15th. - Mm-kay, well, that'll be a road trip. - Yeah, it'll be close one down, get in the car and go to the west end of the state. - Kathy and I often talk about what we'd have done different, and we really can't think of anything unless I found a rich wife. Man, something smells good. - I only cook the best. - I started dating Kathy when she was 14 years old coming up to be a freshman in high school, and we've basically been inseparable since then. And I married a hot babe. - Really? Really? - Yeah, really. - I don't know what you did with her. - I've had her all along. Why, I'm just like a lot of other farmers right now trying to figure out how to make the farm go into the future. I've got two grown sons that both have lives off the farm that help when they can. - Here, let me get you a new fork. - You going straight to DC from there? - Well, right now I'm landing in Kansas City at six in the evening. Then I gotta go to DC again, so almost all of September and October I'm gonna be traveling. - What still needs mowed and hayed? - All we got left is that patch that you were mowing the other night. That's it. - As long as the bailor doesn't break down, I can, I can get that while you're gone. - Melissa. You think you might be able to use any of this stuff? Or maybe Alex? This is all pens and stuff. I still gotta go back Friday. - To do what? - I have to sign my paperwork, and then, it's official after that. - All right, and then as far as medical, is that till the end of this month? - Yeah, yeah. And I have the number that I'm supposed to call for the pension. So. We're going to be just fine. Man, don't, don't get like this on me. It's like you don't believe in me, man. - Junior, I didn't say that, I just, I don't handle stress well. - Okay. Well stop acting like that because, you know, you're taking this worse than me, and this is my job, not yours. - Um, 'cause we're down, it's going to be one income, Junior. - No, it's not. I'm gonna get unemployment and it's gonna be about $150 less... - That's why I asked. - Than what I already bring home. - I don't know what you're... how... what it was. - Right, but I've told you this. Like, you're acting like this is the end. - No, no. - This is crazy. I'm happy. I mean, you're like raining on my parade right now. - Because I want to make sure that everything is fine. - Did we just meet yesterday? - No, but did... - How long have we been together? How long we been together? 24 years? - Okay. And you know how hard it is to get a job, right? - And I've been working at 3M for 11 years only? Hold on, I'm asking you a question. 11 years I've been at 3M. Have we been okay for the other 13? - Yeah. Right. - So why are you concerned about the next... - Because this is what we're living in. - Right. - We got bills. - Right, bills. That's it. Everyday, recurring bills. This house is paid off. - Thank God. - Right, so what are you, stop looking... - I'm asking you. - Stop looking at the things that are concerning you and look at all the things that are great. Alex. - Yeah? - Come here. Do you have any homework or anything? Where's the social studies? - Wait, no, not social studies. Simple solutions. - So, math. - No. - What is this? English and grammar. Where you at in there? This last page here? - Mm-hm. - How many pages did you have to do? - Just one. - Hey, baby. - Hi, good morning. - It says buy so it's, "Buy milk." "I do have faith in you." Always is a word that we've said to each other since, uh, since we met, and basically, it represents infinity. So she would ask, or I would ask, do you love me. And the answer was always. So. It means something. Without always, there wouldn't be them beautiful girls, my son, or my grandchildren. There would be none of that. - All right, good morning. Welcome to Ohio Means Jobs, Lorain County. So, what do we do? We help people find jobs. We help employers find employees. And we help job seekers gain employable skills. So, I already got asked this morning before we actually got started about going to school. That is not our primary goal. Our primary goal is employment. Any questions? No? All right, so, I'm passing out the registration packets that you need to complete. I flipped the screen on the SMART Board up front. This next one, if you are on disability, you're gonna check that off. If you have a felony, if you've been in prison, you're an ex-offender. Public assistance. And then you're going to sign this page where it says, "Signature of Applicant." - What are your goals? What are you aiming to do with this program? - My goals, I don't, I don't want to work for anybody. I wanna work for myself. I want to start my own business. First choice would be HVAC. I understand that I might have to work for a year or two with someone to maybe get some experience, but at some point I'm absolutely gonna branch off on my own. - Do you have any HVAC experience? - Zero. Zero experience. I remember being in fourth grade, my father got laid off, and that's when all the bad starts to happen in my life. It was low-income housing from that point forward. And, so we literally moved to the other side of the tracks. Walk right through this sidewalk here and get to the middle of the projects. And that's where it all went down. That's where everyone wanted to be. The reality of it was I learned how to cook cocaine into freebase when I was 14 years old. The choice was either you sink or you swim. And I'm talkin' shark infested waters. I don't want Alex to waste years of his life like I did. I want him to allow my mistakes to teach him and to actually be his. I want him to be better than me, so that's what I kind of focus on. Don't try to kill it, okay? Ready? - Mm-hm. - Take a step back, there you go. Put the bat out. The fat part right over the plate. That's where you want to be, you ready? Hard swings, okay? Step in. Turn. Do it. Yep. - Here, throw it to 'Buelo. Throw it to 'Buelo. Do you have homework, Alex? - No. - Huh? - No. - No? - No, I did it. - Okay. Are you done with the unemployment office then? - I'ma be dealing with them till I do what I do. - Stop it. - Either do my business or get a job. But I learned something today. This world, they don't teach you how to, like start a business, or, or even, you know like, for example, like you know how I've been talking about how I want to invest money and stuff like that? Like, they don't, they don't even talk about any of that. - Well, Junior, you could talk to a financial consultant. - No, it ain't even about that. I mean, not one time did they talk about anything other than how to be a good worker. That's all they want to do. They want to teach you to work and just be a regular little employee. I don't wanna be regular. - A lot of times, even when manufacturing jobs come back to the United States, they left paying $33 an hour, they came back paying 15 or $16 an hour. - I think this is the biggest challenge facing Western leaders, and no one, frankly, has come up with any good solutions. What do you do about post-manufacturing job growth, and what do you do about wages for people who are still in the manufacturing sector? When a farm fails, the person who was in charge when it failed feels they have betrayed previous generations and future generations. This year, my grandson, a fifth generation, 25 years old, put out his first crop. USDA has projected a 50% decline in income. This year, net income for farmers. Any of y'all want to take half a cut in pay? Try to pay your bills. That's what is happening. Thank you. Thank you, Terry. And, Donn Teske is next. Donn is the Vice President of National Farmers Union and also a grain and livestock farmer. - Good afternoon, and thank you for having the patience today to be here with us. And so I'm 62 now, and so I figure I'm in that fine line between wise old sage and silly old coot. I want to get kind of the basics of working with a farm family, is what I want to share. Not all of my clients are crisis clients that I would do work with estates and et cetera, but the vast majority were crisis calls. And there were many a night when I had a wife call me and say, "You need to talk to my husband "because he's not going to last till morning." And if you talk all night long to someone so they don't shoot themselves, it gets pretty damn personal. We as a society owe the American farmer a way of having all the help they can to do what they need to do to move forward with their lives and their families. I'm sorry to drag it on but thank you very much for your time. Thank you, Donn. - Theodore Roosevelt was the first trustbuster. He's the first one that took seriously the concentration of the industrial complex of America. And Farmers Union's main mission's now, one of our things we take to the Hill, is the concentration in agribusiness and what that's doing to the family farmer. And, it would just be so wonderful to have another Theodore Roosevelt right now. I'm an introvert doing an extrovert's job. I need a little alone time once in a while. - You seem like a people person. - Oh, I am a people person. I like picking up people. All right, bye, have fun. Everybody says that. What do you do for work? And that kind of brought me out of my shell, so I learned, I've learned that, you know, I can talk to anyone now. Pure strangers, I can talk to them. I can find something that I have in common with them. - How many grandkids do you have? - I have three now. You do logistics for work? - Yeah. It's good energy, good people. - That's important. Trust me, where you work at. I've been in, over my years, I've been in places where it wasn't good energy. - Yeah? - Like, do you ever feel unsafe, doing this? - For the longest time, I didn't drive nights. I had a couple incidences. My fiancÃ©'s like, "That's it. "I'm putting a curfew on you. "You have one o'clock, that's the latest." - And how long have you been doing this? - 3 1/2 years. My career was in the mortgage industry. - Oh, okay. - And then when the market fell, that's when I fell into this. You have to hustle. You definitely have to hustle. - Yeah. - I'm working about 140 to 150 hours a week out of my truck. I'm sleeping here. I have my pillow. I have a toothbrush, toothpaste in the car. I mean, I got baby wipes in the car. I'm taking showers in the bathroom. - Yeah. - You know. I'm finally at 33. - How long have you been driving? - I just started the day before yesterday. - Oh my gosh. You're brand new. So, you've been doing this for two days, so how do you feel about what you've been earning, so far? - I'm happy. I really am. - Really? - I'm on five star right now. I got five star three times already. - Okay, I understand there's a lot of drivers that go, "I'm making it, I'm killing it." Because they're trying to keep the new drivers on the road because that's how they hook you. Now, when I first started, I was making $1,000 to $1,500 a week. - Oh, wow. - Working 40 to 45 hours a week. Now I'm working 60 to 70 hours a week, and I can barely make $800. Because look at the parking lot. - Right. - These are all drivers. - Right. - One day you're going to be standing where I'm standing, saying, "Oh my god, I'm not making any money." What happened? - I was at 13 again, and it took me right back to 46. - Are you serious? - Dead serious. And it kicked me out again and took me back to the end of the line. This is ridiculous. There's somebody in this airport that's either jamming our phones and kicking us out, or there's a major problem with your app, and y'all need to fix this because I'm, I'm losing everything because of this. - Yeah, sorry. No, sorry doesn't pay my bills. - Well, I'm not going anywhere, obviously, so please just fix it. - There needs to be some kind of step taken for these companies, that you can't take advantage of these people. You can't take advantage of us. We have rights. I mean, I'm a fighter. I don't walk away. Where would any change in this world take place if everybody walks away? All right, guys. I'm getting supplies now for tomorrow. Is there anything that you guys can think of we need other than markers and poster board? Hey, you know there's a protest tomorrow, right? For more rate, higher rate. - Yeah. - Okay, come. Something's gotta change. - Our goal through this is to create a world for our grandchildren that they can thrive and prosper in, and it's our responsibility to allow our farmers to farm profitably, and we can do that. - All right, go ahead. Have a good day. Learn everything so you can teach me. Morning, I'm here for registration for the HVAC courses. - What you doing, Greyson? What you got? Come and show Nana. What you got? Let me, can I see? No, but Daddy can. Gimme a kiss. Oh, quit whining. Hey, Spence, how you doing? You wanna write your own sign? If the passengers recognize we're fighting for them too, that puts them on our side. - Yeah, write Uber on there so they know who it's for. - I just hope people show up tomorrow. - Hey, Carlos, how ya doing? - Hey, good. - Is everybody else... where's everybody? - Huh? - Where's everybody? - If you're working, you're agreeing that 80 cents a mile minus 25% is good. We all have bills to pay but we are all losing money sitting around here twiddling. Nobody's making money standing here. Can't feed your family for 80 cents a mile. Come join us. I know you've been here a while. Tell me one guy that's making money right now. - You're right, you're right. - None of us. So get out there and start doing something. - That's the problem, we're making way less than minimum wage out there, working 80 hours. We just want fair pay. - Thank you! Thank you for the support! Face 'em forward, guys, face them signs forwards so that people can see 'em. - Jessie Edson. Kal Puening. Mario Francisco. Kerolus Ayed. Agapito Velez, Pete. - Yeah. - Okay. So, I'm interested in, how did, how did you get into this? How'd you get here? - I got here through my father. Yeah, he recommended it. - He recommended it? - Mm hm. - Okay. And how about you, sir? - What brings me here is corporate greed. They were greedy enough to shut the plant down that I had 12 years in. So I just kinda wanna take control of my life and, you know, I don't wanna work in factories anymore. I'm not young but I'm not too old to start over. You know, I should have did this a long time ago. - What I find the difference in this, and I tell a lot of people, if you've ever worked in manufacturing plant or if you've ever worked in one place all the time, it kinda gets old having your boss right there. In this field, in this field you're kinda on your own. You know, you're your own boss, even if you do have somebody to answer to because you're driving their van. So there is a lot of responsibility with that. - Let some of them back, Tyler. - Yeah. - You need to sort the calves from the cows. - Yeah. - Cow! - Hey, hey! - Cow, cow, cow. - Push up there, c'mon. C'mon, c'mon. Turn around. Turn around, get up there. Turn around. Turn around. Get up there. - C'mon. - Get up there. - C'mon. Get. Heyah, heyah! - Get up there, get up there. Get up there, get up there. - Push up, c'mon. C'mon. C'mon, push up. Get up there. - Next Saturday, they're selling an 80 of ground one mile north of us. - So you gonna, are you putting a bid in on this thing? - Yeah, right. Like I'm in any position to buy land right now. I mean, $300,000 debt, I'll never pay that off for the rest of my life, so either that's gonna be sold to you kids, or life insurance is gonna pay it off, so. You know, I'm about petering out of the farming thing, so if you guys want the farm to keep going, you really need to start focusing our efforts what your vision would be for the farm, coming up, rather than what I'm telling you the vision ought to be. - Hey, Robbie, this is Zach. Um, I followed up with Progressive on changing your due date for your payment. One thing I don't remember talking with you about when we wrote your home and auto was canceling your old policies. Is that something you've taken care of? Or did you need me to get you some cancellation forms drawn up? My dad, he's not gonna force me to buy this land. I know that he has reservations about me taking on his debt. I mean, it is a concern of mine, too. But that is what we face. I know he feels this burden of being the generation that lets it die. But it wouldn't be him, it would be me. - As St. Patrick's Day festivities pick up over the weekend, so are the rates. Uber raising its rates in early March across Florida. But overall riders aren't too concerned. But drivers might be the most impacted. We need to disrupt the disruptors. These folks, their overriding priority is profit, and we're struggling, because the middle class is being squeezed out of existence. But do you think people don't come to picket or do whatever because of the fear of, like, retribution from Uber? - Yeah, oh, absolutely, but I've done how many protests now? I've done five. Four, five? I lost count. Well, I just want to let you know that today at four o'clock there's a coordinated break in protest from four to six. So, Rob, you're driving during the protest hours? - If I'm out driving then yes. I'm not turning off during that time. - Turning your app off for two hours is not going to cut that much into your damn money. I don't care what anybody says. - I don't think it would make a difference until we get larger numbers. - You know what amazes me is if the drivers in India can get 50,000 drivers to stop driving, but we can't? That's just, that, I don't get it. I just don't get it. - They don't understand that they could make it better for themselves if they would just stand up and fight for it. People in these third-world countries know that. You know, they can make change if they stand up together and we've given up on that. - C'mon, c'mon. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. The sale of the calves is my main sale of the year. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon. You never know what you're going to get because cattle markets fluctuate wildly. This herd of calves that went to market three years ago, brought $70,000. The year after that they brought $45,000, and then the year after that they brought $30,000. - How 'bout $40 for your half. Hook 'em up, $40 half. A buck 40 got the money. Now I have. Money's on. Sold, a buck 40 in a quarter in 48, 48. Teske's heifers, now. 52 head of 'em all together. - I can give a dollar 70. - I'm up 70. $90. I'm up $90. 89, 75, $90. You wanna be 90? 190. Sold at 193. Put 'em on 1-8-0. - Donn Teske. - Well, did they get 'em sold to your liking? - I think they brought a pretty good price. - Is he gonna let you help spend that? Thank you, sir. - His mother is better at it than anything. Thank you. So I was anticipating 44, and it's 49. - We'll just call that a bonus for all your hard work. - Well, you know, that'll pay back the money I got borrowed to operate this last year. But it won't pay much on the principal. But that's, that's okay. - My unemployment benefits are about to run out, so I need something. You know, and at this point I don't even really care what it is, as long as I can do something around my school schedule. You know, I look around me, and everyone seems to be younger. And here I am, at this age, starting it new. And questions come. Am I ever gonna learn everything I should learn? - The purpose of a job interview is to nail that job, and you've got to keep it in a positive note. They want your future. Remember that. You get what you give. - Mine are bad. Jeez. Look at the difference in length. We gotta pay this water bill, too. Pay by the 17th. - So why is this career change happening? - I just felt like everything that I did was a dead end. But most of all, I just wanna, I just want to feel what it's like to, to love what you do. You still got people at Starbucks that... - Connections? - Who work there? Yeah, the manager. - And how much did you guys used to make there? - Well, after like a year, I made like 9.15. - Oh, no, fuck that. - Why don't you... - I need at least $10 an hour. - Okay, but why don't you do... - Walmart. That's the only place I know... If not, Sam's Club and just say, "Listen, these are the hours." - 'Cause I don't want to drive and Sam's Club closes at eight o'clock. - You're being awfully picky. - I would be there probably by 5:30. You really think they're going to let me work for 2 1/2 hours? I am being picky. When I fill out these applications... - Gas stations will do it. - Man, you know what, I'm done talking to you. I'm not working at no gas station. Did she not hear what I said? I'm gonna repeat it one more time. Gas stations don't hire convicted felons. What do you think I'm looking for? - I'm saying why be so picky on picking a job? - Also contending with a ton of fog this morning. We are dry, that's the good news and I think that we stay that way. Temps outside in the mid and upper 40s to get your Tuesday going with high pressure in place. That induces a sinking motion. - I worry. I know Junior. He does not want to struggle. I try to protect him, you know, from making mistakes, because if not, Junior would be in jail. I fell in love with Junior, immediately. I knew. Junior was 21 and I was 16. Here I am 16 years old, watching him make crack. You know, when he got to 3M, Junior having that job changed a lot for us, you know, because it was a solid job. He was the provider. It made him a responsible man. It made us better. - I actually have my degree in commercial arts and never used it. I thought I was gonna actually be a cartoonist, is what I really thought, but it didn't happen. Not finished. But it does look like him. Starting to anyway. I mean, I've been doing it for a long time, I just haven't done anything with it. I don't know, I guess I really never tried, so. I don't know. And then, life happened. And life keeps happening. You kind of set aside what isn't making you money, and yeah, when you got kids to take care of, you gotta do what you gotta do. I got into the mortgage industry. That was all she wrote. 'Cause I made money in it, so I stayed in it. And then my husband left, so it was me raising three kids, so I, of course, you stay where the money is. - Good afternoon, you workaholics! - Well good afternoon to you, too. - Hey, what's goin' on? - Oh, you know, living the dream. - Oh my god. I seen her. She just almost didn't stop. She almost did not stop. She almost got my rear end. This is Cheryl with Uber. Are you at the Blue terminal? United? - Are you into hockey? - I've never been to a hockey game. - No? - I hear it's a lot of fun. - Yeah, and you're a native. - I know. - Wow. - I'm always working on the weekend. This car is three years old. It has 146,000 miles on it. I spend more of my time with people I don't know than my family, and that's the truth of it all. - I had the best four or five days. I just got back from Stone Mountain of all places. - That's interesting. - Well, Stone Mountain is very unique, we go camping there. - What's the craziest Uber story that you have? - Um, I've had women hit on me. I've had men hit on me. I've had men try to grope me. I mean, I've been thinking about going to get my real estate license, but there could be a lot of disappointment in that game, too. Like, would you say the American dream is still getting a house, owning a house? - Oh, yeah. - You do? You think that's still the American dream? I don't think it is anymore, to be quite honest. I'm not sure what the American dream is anymore. - Yeah, yeah. - I'm just tired. And it's like, okay, I just gave 14 hours of my life today. For what? $100? $70? $80? Like, what is my time worth? It just, it's frustrating. My family is lacking right now in seeing me. I got chewed out royally by Bear today. Chewed out. And it's like, I deserve it, to be frank, quite frank. I deserve it. Like, they don't see me. They don't see me enough. My grandson doesn't see me enough. My kids don't see me enough. Because I'm always trying to make what I need to survive. And I'm not asking for more. Just what I need, you know? - All I need is time. Time to figure out who I am, who I want to be, and where I want to go. Life is all about timing. At times, life seems hopeless. You feel lost. There are some things you can only learn during a storm. Trust me when I say, this is your time, gentlemen. - Agapito Pete Velez. - Congratulations. - Thank you, thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - And you know something? You go for it. You take that beautiful new attitude and just bring it. You've got it. You're the best. - Thank you, thank you. - One, two, three. Super cute. - This is so nice. Give me a big hug and a big kiss. - Are you kidding me? - I just spent $100 on fireworks. - You got a lighter, bro? - I got it. - Watch it, watch, Greyson. Greyson, look, look, look. - I spent a Fourth of July incarcerated. Where my cell was allowed me to see so many different firework shows in the horizon. And the feeling that I had that day was like, one of the worst. It's a moment of clarity. Damn, life goes on, without you. We only have value to our families. Like, nobody else cares. I'm nervous. Feels kinda like the first day of school. I feel like the new guy. I feel like everybody is staring at me. This is a huge step into, you know, my future. Huge step. It has to work out. I really don't have a plan B. So this is it. This is my Plan A through Z. - So our goal is to be a one-stop shop. We come in and we build the items for 'em, we take care of them through the PM department, we service them for any emergencies, and then when they're old and falling apart, we'll do the exchanges and take care of them. So that way we are with the customers from the beginning. - Woo! He would have got it. - Mm hm. - That's three outs. - Yeah. - Attention the Foreign War Department of Ohio, section 110, the Miller Family and friends are here. First started off Lakewood to... - Hold up. - Where you going? - Hey, Skyla. How's it going? Ah, screw my friends. - Huh? - Screw my friends. - What? - No one hi from Skyla. - You said hi to her? - Yeah, she didn't say jack back. - Which one was Skyla? - The one in the black tank top. The tall one. - That was your friend? She just played you. Right? - Come on, batter up, there we go. You okay? - Yeah. - What's wrong? - The sun. - Making his way to the batter's box, the center fielder, Hunter. - What is that? - From the school. - What? - From the school. Alex, remember when you were talking to the counselor? - Yeah. - So, here they were talking about, like things that help you concentrate and things that don't. So when the, the lady that was talking to you, who was it, the counselor? Or was she the therapist? - Counselor. - A counselor? Is this stuff that you completed? "I do things other people would think are strange. "I wear old shoes, listen to old music, and roll up pants." That's 'cause you're unique, it's not 'cause you're strange. - No, that's different. - Okay. "Sessions with Alex lack productivity "as he was often single-minded "and unwilling to accept and responsible for his actions, "be open to change." So they're saying that you're not open to change. So, tomorrow I'm calling them to see what their recommendations are. - What do you mean? - To see what they came up with. Things to help you. This is not bad. Hope you know. All right? So maybe for the next year you won't have a hard time. - At least Ms. Thompson's leaving because that means I don't have to deal with her yelling at me. - It's not that, Junior, Alex, it's just that they're trying to help you figure things out, so that way you don't have a hard time in school. You understand? - Mm hm. - So don't make it seem like it's because they're attacking you. It's that they are trying to help you. Okay? Okay? - Hello, Donn. - Hi. - How are you? - Good, hi! - Good to see you! - Thank you. - What a market it is here. - You're a big enough customer. - It does hesitate me just a little bit to say what are we gonna do if we are bringing in another young person into the farm? Is it gonna cash flow? How's it gonna be? I have three daughters and you sometimes think about, well, what kind of lifestyle do you want for them? - Right. These are the issues that we always have to face. As I came into the room earlier, someone I met right off the bat said they were thinking about how to bring children into the operation, knowing that the operation already wasn't supporting their generation, so it was not at all clear how it was gonna support a second generation. I'm curious if any of you have gotten bogged down at this point of trying to have a conversation with your family. Is there someone in the family who sort of always gets saddled with the burden of being the responsible one? Are they becoming resentful of that? Does anyone here have a written plan for some sort of a written emergency operations plan for their farm? Like, something happened to you, are you confident that all the bills could get paid? All the animals could get fed? People could make bank transfers as needed? - We ready? - Okay, then I guess not. - Here we are, that's okay. - Uh, for almost a year now I've been battling an issue with my thyroid. The physician, he says, "We had to do a CT scan that included your lungs. "And on the very edge of the CT scan, "we found something concerning." And so... They made us stay overnight and then do an MRI on Wednesday. They confirmed I have a mass in my kidney that's almost certainly cancerous. We're just scared right now. And that's why I asked to do this. I thought, it's gonna come out anyhow, we just as well get it on tape. So, that's all I wanted to say. - Okay, c'mon. - Mom, why didn't you tell me I had therapy? - I told you it was today. - In 1.2 miles, turn right to merge onto Ohio 2-West towards Sandusky. - Oh, did you ask about the movie thing? - Yes, but nobody wants to go. - They don't want to go? - No one. - Okay, that's fine. You offered. - The destination is on your left. - Our son has no friends. He's socialized by himself. That is not healthy. - I agree. - Okay, so that's... - But how can I help that, though? - Going to therapy with him. That helps him, Junior. - Man, listen. - No, no, no. That does help him. - Listen, don't try to bring the therapy into it. - What are you talking about? You don't think? I mean, seriously. - You know I don't believe in this kind of stuff, you know that. I believe in self-therapy. - No. - But if you believe in it, then that's good. - I do believe in it. - Okay. - Yeah. You know what, that's fine. You know what, do what you want. - Love you, Dad. - Hi, Alex. - Hello. - I'm Mrs. Aliff. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - Hi. - Hi, pleasure. Melissa. - Oh, nice to meet you. - So we just took him to the cafeteria and I showed him where the breakfast and stuff is. And I told him the process of what breakfast is going on. - Okay. - That if he's here before 7:15, he'll sit there until 7:45 and then come back to class. - Right, and you'll come to here. And kids are excited to meet you. I told them we're having a new student. Do you play basketball? - No. - No? Are you a runner? We have a cross-country team. - How, um, as far as lunch is, I know that him being new, do you guys have where kids sit together? I just don't want him being by himself, sitting. - Yeah, well, to be honest with you, it's pretty packed in middle school lunch right now, so there will always be somebody sitting with somebody. If you don't like a table, we'll move you to a different table, kind of a thing. So, there's lots of kids in lunch. You'll see, it gets hectic during lunchtime. - I just don't want him sitting by himself. - Oh, no. No. - No, absolutely not. All right. Excited? - Yeah. - Okay, cool. All right. - He's smiling in the inside, I'm telling you. It's all smiles in there. - It's all right, it's early. - Did you feel comfortable? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Mm-hm. - Do you feel good about it? - It's a school. - Well, I mean it's a new school. Yeah? - I know. I know. - Okay. You know if you ever have a problem, you can let us know, immediately, all right? I think you're gonna make some friends here. You can do that, right? - Mm-hm. - Right? - Mm-hm. - Okay. You sure you happy? - Yes, Mom. - All right. - The issue here is not what happened today. The issue here is one thing. I bet you don't, you can't even name the one thing I've asked of you. - To be on your side when it comes to parenting! - Right. So, have you done that for real? - Okay. - Have you done that for real? - Yes, anything you want, Junior. I'm telling you. But if you could just open your eyes just a little bit and see that this kid, our son, is really having issues. - His issues are... - No, Junior, you fail to see he is having issues. - His issues are that he does not know how to own up to the things that he does. That's what his issues are, Melissa, in case you're forgetting. "It's the teacher's fault." "The teachers are picking on me." I'm gonna tell you something right now. You want to know what the real issue here is? The real issue here is us, that all he ever sees is me and you arguing. So, really, the reality of it is, that me and you aren't healthy for the boy. - Then let's work on you and me. Why can't we work on you and me? Because the love is there. - Because... - No, the love is there. - You're fighting for the idea of let's not throw away 25 years. - No, honey, that's not what I'm doing. - I'm fighting for peace of mind. - No. You're not listening. - I'm fighting so that I can raise my son without any interference from his mother, who should be on my side. - And I am. I am. - There's like three or four flights that just came in between I don't know like 12:40 and like 1:30. - Now I got my first Lyft ride that I'm about to pick up because I'm the next one in queue. - Hi guys, I'm running through the car wash and then I'll be over there. - It's Tuesday at three o'clock, I wouldn't expect much. - What the fuck was that? What was that? Oh my god, where did he come from? I just hit him! Oh my god! Oh my god, this is not good. Oh my god! - You okay? - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm good. - Is your bike all right? You all right? I'm shaking. - Do you not see my point? - Do you not see why I didn't even wanna say nothing to you? - Don't cut me off. - All right. - I said don't cut me off. - All right. - You're a fucking dick. Idiot. - All right, ma'am, you're gonna be at fault in the crash. - But I didn't see him. He, we, because of the traffic stop. - I understand that, ma'am, but had you have seen him, there would have not been a crash. Right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. But it's still, unfortunately, it's your fault. You have any other questions for me? Okay. - Hello? We're all done. He's doing fine. Everything went smoothly. - Really? - Yeah, absolutely. - Thank you. - My pleasure. So we were able to take the mass out, left the whole kidney behind. He did great, really, really well. Of course, we will send that to pathology, and we'll get a, you know, a diagnosis on that and kinda know from there. But I felt really good about getting it all out. - Thank you. - This is a one-bedroom unit. - Wow. Oh my goodness. Wow. This definitely could've been another bedroom. - Bathroom, we've got Italian porcelain tile, and very, very nice, real nice and unique. - Yes. - European toilet. And granite and further porcelain on the floor. So it's a real nice, nice touch. - This is really nice. Wow. - God forbid, in case of an emergency, I can call Ana Maria? - Yes, that's my mom. - Is there anyone else I could call? - I would say my current wife, but, given the circumstances that have me looking for an apartment, probably not. - Okay, no problem. - Um, at some point, I do want to be able to have my son with me. - Okay, I understand. - But we're looking at, he's in seventh grade now, so we're looking at, I don't want him to go to high school in Lorain. - Gotcha. - So we're looking at another year and a half, approximately. - Okay, so in other words, another year and a half to settle matters, perhaps? And then you may need a two-bedroom. - And then I may need a two-bedroom, exactly. - Okay. Well, look us up, and we'll see what we can do for you. But for the time being, the one bedroom would suffice? - Absolutely. - Okay. - Beautiful apartments. $940 a month, though. That's, that's a lot. - And that leadership component, as I say, doesn't always mean somebody follows you. A leader is somebody who lives life on their terms, that you will never settle for less than you can be, or share, or give, or create. It's not what we get that makes us happy, it's who we become. How we live our life, who we are as a person, people can take away all the things, but who you become, no one can take away and the problem is most of us are trying to be something we're not, but it isn't so much about change. - I'm putting the gel on. And it's supposed to help with your hormone balance. It's HGH. And there's over 40 different benefits from it, so you can, you may experience weight loss, muscle gain. And this is actually what my new business is. I've joined a multi-level marketing company, that has got to do with anti-aging benefits for the body. I'm pretty excited. Knowing that I'm gonna eventually be able to quit driving. I'm moving on. Moving on. - You're gonna be alive when it's really you. You'll feel euphoric, you'll feel calm, you'll feel unlimited, you'll feel free. So I don't know how to start this conversation, but, you know, I'm not blessed to have the ability to just retire because I'm servicing too much debt and so, you know, probably gonna have to sell a piece of ground to reduce the debt to make it work our way into retirement. - When you're saying selling it, you mean selling it to us? - You or someone. - Tyler, what are your thoughts? - I would like to continue the cow herd. My thoughts. I mean... - You want to? Or you just don't want to be the reason that it doesn't continue? - No, I want to. - My concern is that you have this little problem that I also have, and that's that you don't want to tell Dad something that he doesn't want to hear. - Mm, no. - I don't know that I'd advise you to do it. I mean, I did it, and you kids were raised in that environment where I was always broke and always stressed out. And that's probably affected you negatively, but I look back and I don't know what I'd have done differently. - Ultimately, you say what do you want out of it at the end of the day. What I would prefer out of it at the end of the day would be that that land is not owned by somebody else. That's all I really care about. I don't know. I just don't want the land to be in somebody else's name, because once it's gone, it's never coming back. - With the Rose Garden as his backdrop this morning, President Trump is poised to announce eight billion dollars for his border wall by declaring a national emergency. He will effectively bypass Congress to fund his key priority. The move will allow him to redirect federal funds from several pre-existing sources. - That last fight was a doozy. I was done, I was ready to go. But I'm who I am and I am where I am because of her. I'm better with her. All right, I'm out. - Bye, Baby. - Bye. - See you later. - Love you, bye. - Have a good one. I don't know if there's a woman that will ever love me as much as this woman does. I owe her a lot, with who I am and what I am right now. I'm hopeful you know, I'm still here. I'm still in the fight. - Do you have another job besides driving Uber? - Um, I do, I have a online business. - Mm-hm. - I sell, well, actually, it's a health and wellness. - Ooh. - So, yep. The first HGH, human growth hormone, transdermal homeopathic gel in the world. - Oh, what does it do? - It has over 40 different benefits. - Ooh. - It's a youth serum. - It's what? - It's a youth serum. They're calling it the turning back the hands of time. Yeah. - This is Donn Teske, I was gonna light a fire. - Native prairie. - About 100 acres. - Alrighty. You know I know every square inch of this place. And this is my belonging and being. And every time we end up selling a piece of land, it's just part of my soul, part of my heart. There's something damned wrong that somebody can be farming 900 acres of America and not make a living doing it.
