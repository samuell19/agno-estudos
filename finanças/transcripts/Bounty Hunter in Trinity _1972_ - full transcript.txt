The Navajeros! Let's go, and be quick about it! Calm now, calm down and stay, my beautiful horsy! Open it up! Gold, gold! Minted gold! Ready to be used!! Goo...good day, gents! We'd need a loan ... ...and they told us that you are the only person who can give one. But we don't want to pay too much interest... But the information they gave you is incorrect. I'm only a notary, I'm sorry... Ahh is that so? They were probably mistaken then... but we don't like to leave with empty hands. I repeat, I'm only a notary... ...I don't have money to give out a loan. You have to approach someon else... Ah is that so? I don't have any money! Okay. You want to say that we will have to serve ourselves. Now he won't cause any more difficulties, no? Ah, there we are! He doesn't have any money, ey? They left town THAT way!! Fucking bastards!!! Either we eliminate those navajeros or we leave town ourselves. The army is fully involved in the Indian wars. It's up to us to resolve the problem. We'd have already resolved it in one strike... ...if only the sheriff knew how to go about his job! I do everything that's possible and don't need to reproach myself of anything. But here there's something that doesn't feel right. Every gold transport destined to arrive here at Trinit? is attacked, on a regular basis. What if someone here informed the navajeros of those transports? Mayor, if things are that way - and I am firmly convinced of that - ... it's clear that I'm no longer capable of doing my job properly. My hand are bound! And then I can't endanger human lives any longer! Remember that only recently have I lost already two deputies ! Sheriff, you are paid to make sure that people respect the law... ...and in so doing, you run the risks that form part of your salary. Right, but I cannot continue - This talking doesn't get us anywhere! For me, the only solution is to hire a bounty killer ... ... and clean up the place - ... once and for all! Besides, the navajeros all have a price set out on their heads... ... and when we can bring ourselves to heighten the bounties, ... ... we'll find someone who'll take the job. No, no! I don't agree! We have a right to be protected, ... and so why do have to spend money on that? Exactly! My funeral won't cost you a cent! Be quiet, I want to make a proposition. I find it more reasonable to contact the justice department ... and that's why I'll have a telegraph sent to Dallas to send us a federal sheriff. Great! - I'm all for it. Pizarro's arriving! What gave us the pleasure of your visit? Do you come to check on us? Don't you trust us any longer? Or is there something that brings a change to our plans? No, the federal sheriff will pass by soon as planned. No difficulty in that, it's like he was already dead and buried. Pedro will take care of that. It's not going to be the first sheriff he takes out. You're mistaken. We will have to stop doing business with each other for some time. I have never left out ... - Hey!! He's coming! Where are you going, doctor? I am not a doctor, I am a federal sheriff. And I have to get to Trinit?. It's a bloody crime with Trinit?, it's no place for frightened people, sheriff! Alright, I have to get there before sunset. Take care at what you're doing, young man! Oh no, Raya! Don't frighten the sheriff, now... Thank you. And now let me pass! Have a nice trip! Go get yourself you heritage, Raya! It has stopped! Just like its owner. Only that a watch is something you can fix! Let's go! Hey, wake up!! Is there noone in Trinit?? Where are you, sheriff?? Don't be afraid, we only kill men! No mortal on this land... Let's do some fireworks! You sods! Tell your boss that the next time it'll be HIS turn! And now we're ready to leave! Hey, sheriff, see you soon! - Arrivederci, sheriff! Let go of me! You want to save the skin of your sons? Then sign the farmstead over to me! I will do as you will, but the judge won't approve the deal. We'll convince him, alright! You sods, one day they will make you pay for it! Hand over the quill, the old one has made his decision. There, boss! Fast, to the horses! Be done with it! Let's go! They're coming back! Ah, look who's here: It's our friend Pizarro! So what d'ya say? Today we've done a great job for you ... It's not bad, Sancho. I think they begin to learn their lesson. So everything's swell, you'll be the boss in Trinit?! Your saloon will turn out to be a goldmine! And all in all, we've have left a good impression down there in town. It's equally nice that they have raised the rewards placed on your heads. Now they amount to 10.000 $ for each one of you. That's a nice sum! No, we can't complain now, can we? Tell the truth, now, you envy us, don't you? Yeah...but watch out, the thing might raise the appetite of a bounty hunter. Sure, 'cos it's a lot, 20.000 $... What do YOU say to that, my little brother? ...that this hunter will catch himself 20.000 slugs in his ass! What's your plan: to return to Trinit?? Yep, it's the right time for my horse to rest. Alright, tomorrow we'll come to find you - Prepare a river of whisky, for us and the boys! We'll cut down the telegrapher's sons! ... after the ceremony and the festivities. Perfect. The navajeros are coming! Now! Everyone to their posts! We'll welcome them just like they deserve! They arrive! - You, go back there! You, stay here! Venga, signor sheriff! Bring the women in safety! Let's set up those things! Where's the father? - Up there! - Quiet now! Come and party with us! Have they gone mad? Seems they're serious about it this time. What's the plan, boss? Let's leave! They get away! We've given them a good lesson now! Good chances they'll leave us in peace. No reason to have illusions about it! We have remained practically isolated. Even if today we managed to fight them off, this does not turn round things completely. You should say: THEY managed to fight them back. 'Cos during the time the others were fighting, you stayed in hiding God knows where! Could we quiet down now, gentlemen? And let's try to find a solution. And promptly! - We can't place our trust in the government. You've seen who they sent us. A decrepit old man to fight a band of navajeros. Come on! ... The situation calls for a hotshot! A bounty killer! Just follow me in this! Let's send someone to fetch us Adam Boyd! According to me, there's nothing else to do. Okay, but a bounty killer's bills will be steep, or what do you think? We'll pay what we have to. Let's go and call this man! - Right. So we're all okay with that, we'll call him. But we have to choose someone whom the bandits won't suspect. Of course. Why don't we send the son of Sam Geoffrey? Why not? - The bandits won't ever suspect that a mere boy was trusted with a mission as important as that. What do you say? I agree. - Okay. - Yes, I agree as well. Alright, it's been decided. So, unexpectedly, they woke up... Sons of dogs! They have to arrange themselves with us, haven't they grasped that yet? It seems they haven't. And they're about to send the son of Sam Geoffrey to call ... ... for a bounty killer. It's clear that he can't be allowed to finish his journey. He won't arrive, I can guarantee that. And then ... we'll have to prepare a heads-on confrontation. Only when WE rule the roost will order be able to return. Just so! Does everyone agree? Order and rule of the law... - OUR way! Listen to my advice, sonny: Be careful! Rest assured, daddy, tomorrow evening I'll be home again safe and sound. I have the fastest horse in the country, nobody will be able to stop me. Alright, go, sonny! And may God be with you! See you soon, daddy! - See you soon! Have a good trip, sonny! Our move was premature. We have sacrificed the life of this boy in vain. The sheriff is right: Somebody tells them about our actions. But if that's so, we don't have any escape-route left. Pent up in this city, we'll have to suffer the assaults of the navajeros indefinitely! No: I won't tell nobody when and how I will go to meet the bounty killer. I imagine you have calculated the risks you meet, advocate. - Sure. That's very generous on your part. Be careful, and as far as the deal is concerned, you have carte blanche. I thank you. And as things are now: The sooner I leave, the better it will be. Mm, okay. Where were we? You were just telling me that you're very expensive. Like all serious professionals. Yes, I know, I know. But that's not the problem, Mr. Boyd. We'll pay just about any sum... ... to get rid of those bandits. See, recently I've had many offers. Right now, my fee is 20.000$ in advance... ...and 2.000 for each dead guy. And then the bounties, of course. Take it or leave it. ... forgot: 3 dead guys in advance. I have some small expenses, too. It's a deal. There you go. And what's that you have there? That's a gun that never rusts. But... ...it's deadlier than a Winchester. And is it accurate? Watch. What do you make of that? Alright, it's a deal. We'll be expecting you. We'll meet again in Trinit?. - Okay. Come on, Willy, rise! Each time I see you, I ask myself how it fits you to joke about - - with this damned job of yours! Who knows. Maybe it's because recently, business is good. And then ... Something tells me that from today onwards, it'll be even better! What exactly's the reason? The fact that you have arrived here. My visit is strictly business. If you're a true friend, you have to tell me: Who in town informs the navajeros of everything that happens in Trinit?. You know, hereabouts, the more I watch my breath, the longer I live. I won't give away anybody. (?) But there's a certain Pizarro... He's the owner of the saloon and of half the city. ... and if you ask me, he wants to cash in the other half too. However, let's tread lightly: I never told you anything. But Willy: You know you make beautiful things? It got better since last time I was here. One can see you had a chance to practice. Anyway ... ... get ready some duplicates of these! The next few days, you'll have a whole lot of clients. You want my advice, Alan? Be on your watch, those people are reckless. They're not human, they're beasts! And you never find them alone. They're like a pack of wolves... ... ready to kill whoever they meet on the streets. I wouldn't like it if it had to be I who'd make your last garment. Even though for you... ... I'm sure I'd make my masterpiece. So sorry to rob you of a masterpiece - But the guy who'll have to make my coffin hasn't yet been born. Do I disturb you? Listen, even if I am your prisoner: You knock first, before entering. You're the boss of the saloon, not mine. Prisoner...! If you wanted it, I'd be even ready to marry you. Since your father doesn't tell me where he hides his gold ... after marrying you...it'd become mine by right. You're despicable, recklessly ambitious. Even to thought of living with you makes me shudder. You'll never have as much as the gold! I always get what I want. A glass of milk! Did you say milk? - Milk! Instantly. Hey, stranger, how did you ever get here? It's forbidden. Don't you know that in these bars, children need to be accompanied by their mother? Forget about it, stranger. You know how to play ...? - Sure. You'd play a game with me? - I'd love to. I like this piece of land, I think I'll stay here for awhile. I am one who loves peace and tranquillity. You know, I have so often changed places... ...and this here seems to me just the right quiet spot. - Quiet? Nice for you! Once it was a quiet spot. But now ... Let's forget about it! Now people are leaving because they now longer want to suffer - And if you come down to it, they're right. Why? What is it they no longer want to suffer? Can you tell me? There's a rotten pack of bastards that controls the whole territory around here. A certain Pizarro has bought up half the city ... ... and has brought everbody else to rack and ruin. Hold your beak, you old trollop! I forbid you to talk badly about my boss. And Mr.Pizarro doesn't harm a single person. He's always obliging. When he took over this saloon, he allowed me to drink here as much as I want - 'Cos he's a real gentleman... And here things have never been as good as they are now! You, you talk in madness and rage... ... cos' he doesn't like you. This man has the stuff to be the boss, and he merits to be just that! He always... He's always informed of everything that's going on... He knows everything about everything. He knows even who has sent for Adam Boyd... The fool! He thinks he can frighten him... But I tell you: This one is not gonna arrive alive here in Trinit?. Duh! No wonder, he's maybe a guy a bit dum just like you. I close my game. You plan on staying long? It's not up to me. Let's say it depends on the collective conscience of the inhabitants of this land - I am an insurance salesman, and I specialize in the sector 'life'. Do you think you have need of me here in Trinit?? Here's your keys. I wish you a pleasant rest. You have not answer my question. If you want my advice, don't waste your time around here. Leave tomorrow. - What a shame! I was convinced I'd be in for some good profits. A drink! Yesterday at the hotel, a respectable guest arrived... He said he was an insurance man, specialising in life insurances, above all. Make him understand that there's only one life in danger around here. His. To our guest! Get on with it! A drink! Bring another bottle of this... Quick, drink! Not now. I've got my hands full... Leave her a bit to me, too! Go home to momma! Come on, share a tiny bit! You're too small! Aah, finally! Stay a bit with us! Just look at her! Now it's my turn. - Eh, scram! This one's already booked. Yes, by me. She's mine! She's mine, mine... Put away your hands! Don't force me to use violence, now! You've had it coming. Sorry, would you hold this for me? - You're welcome. Mister, here's your table. You rascal! Go to your room. Get! Hold yourself! - I hold you, alright. You know how to deal with those smaller than you. - Yeah, sure I can deal with them too... I'm larger. Now show me a bit... There you go! Come, little brother! Quiet there, boys! Entertain us a bit, too! Let's go, now that they're all asleep! Where are you going? Blimey, come back! Damned whores! There he is. Get ready! But that's a puppet! You have let him make fun of you. - He's killed three of our men. - It's Alan Boyd, alright. Kill him! Do you know where he's hiding out? Just you search him in the surrounding land. We will wait for him here. - Let's go! That's 6.000$, mayor. And I hope your safe is well-filled - - 'cos I think I'll bring back a bunch of similar dear friends. Sure...sure. Personlly, I don't sympathise with bounty hunters, but I must admit you do your job quite well. Thank you. Don't worry, I'm not here for you. I have to leave for Dallas, I need money, and I just can't wait any longer. Where did your father hide the gold? No chance. I have already told you: You will never know. Until now, I've played the gentleman with you. But I wouldn't like to be forced to use other ways... This one, for example! No, I'll never talk, never! Violence won't get you anywhere! If I were you, I wouldn't be so sure of that! You'll talk, you'll talk... - No! No! I'd rather die! You're no good to me dead. The dead don't talk. And I have to keep you alive. - Bastard! You cling desperately to your money in your family. Listen!... You've got 12 hours, and then I'll tell the navajeros to entertain themselves a bit with you. I'm sure they'll change your ideas. I won't talk. Nobody will be able to force those words out of my mouth. We'll see... Till soon, my dear. GO TO CHURCH AND YOU WILL KNOW EVERYTHING Why did I even bother. I need some information, and only you can help me. Who's the father of the girl held prisoner by Pizarro? Hehe, why do you want to know? You've decided to ask for her hand? I've decided to see clear in this story and to clear the environment as well. Right. How many coffins should I prepare? - Don't always think about your business! Quick, tell me all you know! The father of the girl is the old Tom Massey. He was a gold digger, and it seems that years ago he actually found some. He then became one of the richest owners of this area. Get yourself ready, you'll have a lot to do. Raya, Miguel, you two go! Wait! Wait here! Let's go, beauty! Put something on and come with us! Who are you? What do you want? Put me down, you sob! Put me down! You villains! Let go of me! Let go of me! Hold your beak! - Help! So... do you want to make up your mind and talk? Answer me! Where did your father hide the gold? Tell me, or I'll lose my patience! He asked you a question. You don't want to answer? Alright. Now I'll make you talk. You don't want to talk? I'll go visit your father. Think about it! The more you keep your silence obstinately, the worse it'll be for him! Just continue to squeeze it out of her! If he gets tired, take turns. If she talks, come tell me at Tom Massey's. Hasta la vista! So...let's continue our lovely little conversation... I won't bore you. I always find convincing arguments. You two, bind her! So... You wanna talk, yes or no? Your daughter is in our hands! What's worth more to you...her or the gold? I'm talking to you, old one! You've got to decide quickly, 'cos it's Paco who's gone to work on her... If you wait too long, you might not recognize her anymore. Just one word, and we'll free both of you. So...where did you hide the gold? Okay. If you want it that way... Didn't get him! Patience... It's gonna be next time. One moment ... and then I'll think about how to free your daughter as well. How can I thank you? - I didn't do it for monetary purposes. For me, it'll be a job like any other. I know that you're a very rich man. And therefore...you'll be ready to pay a bonus for what I've done for you. After all, I think on earning it. So...take it or leave it. Everything you'd want. But who are you? I've never seen you before... What's your name? And what is your profession? I help out the justice department... ... when there's a recompensation, of course. Stop where you are! Up with your hands, and don't get them out of my sight! Bastard! Dismount and kneel! It's time to die! Ride with me until the crossroads. Then, you will return to Trinit? alone and I will pay a visit to the brood of navajeros. Paco arrives! Has the girl talked? - No chance. She's more stubborn than a mule. She's rather be killed. Dammit! Now we don't have even the old one left. This bounty killer freed him. He took me by surprise, I couldn't do anything about it. But I swear I'm going to make him pay badly for it! Look! Look! That must have been that damned bounty killer! Try to get him from behind. Fast! Bastards! Stand still! Don't run away! Where did you hide yourselves? Are you afraid of a single man? Come back right here! You wretches! I'll kill you like the dogs you are! Ah, God! My eyes! My eyes! Help me! Don't abandon me! Help, Sancho! I can't see! Help me! Help me! An assassin for the law is still an assassin. You make me sick, jackal! And now you'll quit, right? I hope you are satisfied with my work. The land would be in need of a good cleanup. I think you shouldn't go anyplace else. I don't think anyone would fancy to be the smart one anymore. But ... if you still were in need of me, I'm always at your disposal. Your daughter is imprisoned in the old mine ... and she is well. And now, if you'd like to recall our agreement... Thank you. Who is Alan Boyd? - What do you want from him? The mayor of Carson City sent me. A band of Mexicans has arrived there. Only a bounty killer can chase them away. And how much are you willing to pay? subs by ironmaster
