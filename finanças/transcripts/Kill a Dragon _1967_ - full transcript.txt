[roaring] [stately music] -[funky music] -♪ To kill a dragon [funky music] ♪ To kill a dragon [ominous music] Senhor Patrai! There's nothing here! [speaking Chinese] So you still won't talk. Now look... if you think the typhoon laid waste to your village, just wait. You have never seen Patrai take what he wants. You have never seen how... I take what I want. So no matter what you think or do, in the end, I will get that cargo. You cannot get it off this island. My boats will be at the entrance to your harbor. You will not fish. Nothing will come in, nothing will go out. Except the dead. I can sometimes make life very unpleasant. It's your choice. Arturo! Call them off! We leave. We retire to the boats! [speaking Chinese] You have three days to tell me where the cargo is. Three days. Then... I will be back. Goodbye. For now. [engines start] [speaking Chinese] [Win Lim speaking Chinese] [background chatter] [inaudible] [speaking Chinese] [Chunhyang speaks Chinese] [indistinct chatter] [Arturo] Tell Patrai we spotted the old man. We'll follow him. [speaking Chinese] [radio response in Chinese] [big band music] How are you? Hope you're enjoying everything. [big band music stops] Ladies and gentlemen, in most countries of the world, as you very well know, when fishermen go to fish the sea they do not take their families with them. But here in Hong Kong, that is not so. Here the people actually live on these junks and sampans that you see about you. You might find it interesting to take some film of these things. Now, these people take everything with them. Dogs, cats, chickens, whatever. All on these junks and sampans. [boat horn] Now, ladies and gentlemen, on the starboard side of our ship, on the right side, we are approaching the two very famous floating restaurants The Sea Palace and the Thai Po. I'm sure that you'll enjoy your lunch in there very much. There's something quite unusua, ladies and gentlemen. See these people here? They are not boat people. They're sampan. They are wearing the ageless blue cotton of the Chinese laborers. They are undoubtedly from one of these small, offshore islans of which there are many. Ladies and gentlemen, as long as we're all together, I would suggest that before we see the sights of Hong Kong this evening, that the ladies return to the hotel, take a nap, refresh themselves, and the gentlemen might like to take a steam bath and a massage to relieve the tense muscles after such a big day. I hope you fellas have enjoyed your trip. Thank you very much. [big band music] [boat horn] [tranquil music] [background chatter] [motor rumbling] [speaking Chinese] [ominous music] [speaking Chinese] [speaking Chinese] Hey, what the hell is going on here? Come on, Confucius, who sent for you? Come on, get lost, will ya? I'm busy. Kind sir. If you only speak softly, we mean no harm. Look, friends, um... I don't want to seem uncivil, or sound inhibited, it's just that anybody looking over my shoulder makes me nervous, you know? [Win Lim] Kind sir... What'd you do, sell tickets? All right, you three. Out. That's funny. [Rick] I, uh... I was just telling them the same thing, too. And now that includes you. Look mister, I don't want any trouble out of you. -It's those three I'm after. -Wait a minute. You know that this happens to be my birthday? And I was just... ready to light up the candles. You wouldn't want to spoil a birthday party, would you? All right wise guy, that's enough. Out! [yells] [yells] [both grunting] [grunts] [continues punching] [gasping] Rick! [both grunting] [gasping] -[grunts] -[thud] Thanks, little tiger for showing your claws. You're welcome, darling. [murmurs] Isn't it a bit too crowded in here? Well, just... restrain yourself till I get rid of them. Hey! Come on! Come here! Now... Where were we, huh? Oh no. Come on! Out! You think it's safe? Yeah, I think it's safe. I think they've had enough. I was very impressed the way you handle yourself. This your boat? Do you own it? Yeah, I own the boat. Come on, out! Out! Out! I like very much discuss something with you. My office is the Suzie Wong. [speaks Chinese] What is your name? My name is Rick Masters. I'm 41 years old, I was born in Lattimer Mines, Pennsylvania. What time at Suzie Wong? Anytime. Anytime at all! [jazzy music] Boy... This place is busier than the Hilton. Is it really your birthday, Rick? What do you think? Light up the candles, Rick. Yeah... like a blowtorch. Happy birthday, darling. -[funky music] -[background chatter] Five ball, center pocket. [Rick] Oh, boy. You know, I just can't seem to top you with the cue. Oh, I don't know about that. You know something, Rick? You could find a salvage job. Begin paying off your debts. I already had one salvage job this afternoon. [whistles] Thanks a lot, Rick. You owe me 500 pounds Hong Kong. You blew out the candles. Look... I adore you madly. The party's over, baby. The tab is full up. And I can't afford to carry you on my books any longer. Hey... How can anybody be so human in the bedroom and so inhuman in the pool room? That was this afternoon. This is Christmas. [exhales sharply] Eight ball left pocket, nine ball right pocket. Come on, you gotta be kidding. [Tisa] Game. It's another 100, Rick. Sure know how to hurt a guy. You didn't say that when I sang Happy Birthday. Yeah, but like you said, that was this afternoon. Now your credit rating is way down. Oh, I'll come up again, honey. Hey! Why don't you just consider me an investment? -No, seriously... -Sure. Like I told you, anything happens to me, you own my boat. I'm worth more to you dead than alive. Now, which way do you want me? [barman] Hey, Tisa! Rick Masters back there with you? Unfortunately. [barman] Old guy out here wants to see him. [Rick] Tell him I'll be right out. Now maybe that's somebody about a job, huh? Come on, honey. Just... one more time on the tab. [chuckles] One of these days I'm going to call Rick Masters behind the eight ball -in the center pocket. -[murmurs] And lose the only competition in town? Next. She's good, sailor. [Rick indistinct] Right over there. My name is Win Lim. You said this was your office. I waited a reasonable time. Thanks. Next time knock, huh? Come on, let's get to the point. Only a dumb man be talkative. Please sit down. I too dislike to take long journey when there is a shortcut. I have a proposition that involves a great deal of money for you. You guys were in a big hurry this afternoon. And the other seemed awfully anxious to stop you. Sir, an honest man appeals to the understanding. The imposter employs force instead of argument. He imposes silence where he cannot convince, and propagates his character by the sword. I assure you, I and my two people come humbly without the teeth of a dragon. Poor, but honest. All right, all right. If it's not too deep or in too tricky a spot I can salvage it for you. The thing you speak of has already been salvaged. -So what's your problem? -You have a boat. We need you to transport the cargo to Hong Kong. -What's the cargo? -Nitra-2. [laughs] Just that old nitra-2? Only the hottest damn one they've come up with in about ten years. Most powerful and most unpredictable. Most expensive. Yeah. It can dig you the deepest grave if you just sneeze. How'd you get it? From the sea. It was a gift from the sea. -Come on. -No, it is the truth. I am from this small island of Po Toi. A chum was washed up on our shore during the storm last week. The crew had deserted. They were afraid the nitra-2 would explode. Our village people has placed it in a safe place. So you claimed it according to rules of salvage. The cargo's yours. Probably worth a small fortune. Well, the original owner disagrees about the cargo being ours. -Who's that? -[Win Lim] Patrai. Patrai, uh? [Win Lim] To be truthful, and in all conscience, I must say I come to you as a last resort. Those are probably Patrai's men who followed you. When I saw how you dealt with them I must say, you fill me with great confidence. [chuckles] Now you're asking for Patrai to fill me with bullets. Sir... I am helpless. He has blocked our harbor and forbidden any boat to enter. He has given us three days to hand over the cargo. If we do not, he will kill us slowly, until we will tell him where we hid it. Look... some free advice: give it to him. You haven't got a chance. Patrai deals only in black market commerce. Now, you've got a choice. You can either give it to the police or to Patrai. But you're not gonna cross him and get away with it. We're prepared to give you one quarter of the profit on the condition you bring the cargo to Hong Kong safely. That'll just about buy the best funeral a man could ever have. Mr. Masters! My island is very small and very poor. We have no school for our children and no medicine for our sick. Many times we do not have enough food. This is a blessing that heaven sent. We will not give such a blessing to Patrai. You don't let go, do you, Win Lim? Every dragon gives birth to a St. George who slays it. And I'm your St. George? You know something, my fine Oriental friend? Kipling once said it: [sighs] "The end of the fight is a tombstone white with the name of the late deceased." And the epitaph read: "A fool lies here who tried to hustle the East." You said a quarter of the profits, huh? You know, I gotta handpick a crew for a job like this. How about... split that down the middle? I am ready to give you one third of the profit. All right. One third. I am completely in your hands, Mr. Masters. [chuckles] You know, I... I must be an idiot. Thanks for the lesson! Wait here a second. [Rick] Darling. [speaking Chinese] Uh... I'm sure you remember Tisa. I wouldn't wait aboard my junk. You'll stay here with Tisa until I get back with my boys. Ah, why don't you show them a couple of tricks? Sure. No, I mean on the... on the table, honey. [crowd yelling] [repeated thuds] Easy, Jimmie! Easy, don't panic! Don't take him yet! "Don't panic"? "Don't take him yet"? That's what you heard me say to me boy! Ten quid he gets his head knocked off! Well you've got a bet, mate! -[thud] -Jimmie! Another ten quid! Jimmie, did you hear me? Another ten quid! [heavy thud] One, two... three, four, five, six, -seven. -[bell clangs loudly] [cheering] Are you all right, Jimmie? Take it easy, boy. Take it easy. -Don't put the slob away yet. -"Don't put the slob away"? Mate, do you want to sweeten the bet another ten quid? I'll make it 20. Twenty? Oh, you're on. You're on. -Jimmie, another 20 quid. -[buzzing] Get in there. [announcer] Seconds out of the ring. Don't carry him, Jimmie. Take him. Fourth round. -[bell clangs loud] -[crowd roars] Go! Hey, Jimmie! [unintelligible yelling] [yelling and cheering] [yells] [loud cheering] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. [mixed cheers and boos] [announcer] The winner of the exhibition boxing karate match in 46 seconds of the fourth round: Jimmie Chan! Come on a bit, Alice. Up a bit. There, there. That's it, love. Right there. Hey Rick! Rick! How are ya, mate? -You know Alice, don't you? -Yeah, sure. Hi. Hey, who did the fight tonight? You or Jimmie? Jimmie. You should have seen him. Beautiful, pure emotion. -Like a rocket in flight -What'd you do? Take the blows for him? Is that any way to talk to a buddy? [Jimmie] Yeah, Rick. He got a couple of bruises collecting our bets. Well, I'm just trying out Ms. Tenderhand's style here. You know how sensitive Jimmie is. I don't know if he'd be able to stand it. Well, as soon as Ms. Tenderhand finishes, meet me at the boat. I got a job for both of you. Well, it may take a little time. I've got some very tender muscles. Yeah, I know. Meet me there anyway. -So long. -Okay. Jimmie! Shower. -Come on, don't catch a cold. -Okay. Let's move. Get organized, mate. -[door closes] -Alice, on me back. [funky music] Hey, Vigo. Hi Rita. Is Vigo in there? He left about an hour ago. He's probably working the nightclub by now. -Thanks. -Oh Ricky! How about a steam? Ah... ah, I'd like it. But, ah... maybe some other time. [all chatting] [jazzy music] [tourist] Hello, you beautiful girls! I want to take a picture. One minute, please. One minute. Would you mind, please? It's a shame my wife can't be here. I warned her not to drink the water. -Another one, please. -[Vigo] Hey. Come on. Come on down now, come on. The girls will be at your table, for crying out loud. Let's go. [Rick] Forgot his camera. Hey Rick! Ha! You've seen the sights, you know the tour. I'm out of money. What do you want? I got a job for you. Like what? Like that last batch of war surplus we tried to salvage out of North Africa? [Rick] No, that was different. This job could pay off in big figures. Look, I got a steady job, I got a regular paycheck, and the tips are all velvet. [Rick] A half million dollar cargo, Vigo. Comes with the tour. -[speaks Chinese] -The drink? Yeah, the drink. Yeah. What's the cargo? Nitra-2. -Bye, Rick. -What's the matter, buddy? No guts? Look, I just don't feeling like parting with this life so early. You know pal, it's a real, terrible shame my wife had to miss all this. But I warned her not to drink that water. Folks, we've only scratched the surface of thrills tonight. When we get back to the hotel, if you'll sign up for tomorrow night's excursion, we will really get to the behind-the-scenes nightlife of Hong Kong, the nightlife that the tourist books dare not reveal. Whose cargo is it? Well, it was Patrai's. Folks, we'll be back at the hotel in a very few minutes. [tourists thank Vigo] I warned my wife not to drink the water. Rick, I seem to recall that Patrai hijacked that last salvage job you had going, and one of his piranha killed your diver. Well, everybody has a bad day once in a while. Now... Who else have you conned into this little goodie? Ian and Jimmie are in. We need their heads examined. [tranquil string music] Charlie, scotch. Same for me, Charlie. So, it was Patrai's cargo, huh? That's right. You know you're asking me to join a suicide club? That Portuguese is a rough cookie. He's the mafia of Macau. One word from him and we're dead. What are you trying to prove, Rick? Trying to be a hero for somebody? Come on, Vigo. You know what kind of hero I am. Just pay me. I'd carry the ball for anybody. Yeah, well I think this is a rigged game, and we have a rough time scoring. Oh, come on. Let's forget it. Wait a minute, wait a minute! I didn't say "no". I know, but you haven't said "yes" yet. Rick, what do you want me to do with these tourists? You want me to, uh... create a bad image, for crying out loud? All the broads talk about is the guys, the guys talk about broads... You company's very welcome. -At least you talk about money. -Yeah. What's the cut? One third. All we have to do is take the cargo from Po Toi into Hong Kong. It'll be split down the line. What I don't do for money and friendship. Yeah. Well friendship, buddy, begins with getting Charlie and his truck. Uh... we have to pick up some gear before we stop for Win Lim and his buddies. Hm... no, no problems. Charlie? Wait for us, we'll be right out. [faint shouts] [Tisa indistinct] Somebody help me up! [grunting] [Rick] Well, what a side pocket shot she'd make, huh? Yeah, I bet. All right, take it easy, honey. -Take it easy. -[Tisa indistinct] I'll blow out your candles and put you on the tab and you don't warn me those same two creeps may come back and snatch that Mr. Shangri-La of yours and those other two creeps! And watch where you're reaching! Come on, I have to untie the knots! Now take it easy, will you! Hey, what two creeps she talking about? Same two that busted in on the boat. He knows. And it's going to be a long, cold night till your next birthday, believe me. I'll make it up, I promise. And I'll come back and pick up the tab. Oh, if you'd live that long... Hey, you talk that way, and I'm not going to invite you to my next birthday. -Good, good! -Yeah? Let's go, Vigo! Let's go! [Vigo] Let's go, Charlie! You got any idea how to get this thing started? Yeah... seems a rival network ran off with our sponsor. And I had to go for your commercial. So we dropped in on Patrai. He has a villa in Macau. They might have taken Win Lim there. Rick, you've really flipped your lid this time. I got it a night or two before. It's hotter than hell. You know what gonna happen to you if something goes wrong? You know what gonna happen to you if everything goes right? You'll never have to ride that bus again. Yeah. -Know something, Rick? -What? That bus is beginning to look better all the time. [scoffs] [Ian] Hey Rick, baby! The boat's all shipshape in Bristol fashion. Everything's fixed down. Where are we going to? -[rattling] -Heading for Macau. Come on, help us get this gear on board. Jimmie! [Patrai] Now you listen to me! I'm fed up with you and your silly games! Going to Rick Masters for help. What do you think he can do for you? No one in this whole area can do anything I don't want them to do. I am Patrai and don't you ever forget it. All of your efforts have been for nothing. Nothing! We have a saying: "Man cannot succeed without trying." I am not interested in your philosophy. We'll go back to Po Toi and get my cargo. On our voyage, we'll come to an understanding. And if we do not come to an understanding? There is nothing to gain by dying. There is honor. It is the honor of the murdered that he is not the murderer. I'll let you argue that point with the dead. I'm only interested in living. And, uh... as you can see, I like to live well. So, you can save me time and trouble. Just tell me where the cargo is, and you will have my blessings. The only blessings I'm grateful for are that I was born a human being, and not one of the brutes. I see. Of course... there is the girl. And if I do not get my cargo... do you know my reputation with women? Hm? [chuckles] [repeated explosions] Stay here. Watch him. [explosions continue] [burst of explosions] [explosions continue] [yells] [grunting] -Win Lim! -[gasps] Wait! How did you know we were here? Chinese fortune cookie. [explosions continue] Rick, you son of a...! [tense music] Hey Jimmie! Will you quit carrying the guy? Come on! Yeah. Right. [grunting] [whispers] Win Lim. [grunting] I couldn't remember if I was supposed to win -or lose that one. -Yeah. Ian's been fixing too many fights for you. Let's go. [indistinct chatter] Rick! They're coming from all over. Then we'd better make a run for it. -Come on! -Wait a minute! Wait a minute. What about these? Yeah. Hey! [speaking Chinese] [indistinct whispering] No sign of Rick's boat on the waterfront. [speaks Chinese] -Let's find him! -Okay. Let's go! [whispers] Come on. [grunts] Come here. -[ominous music] -[both grunting] [indistinct speech] [gunshot] Where the hell is that lime? They're somewhere, don't worry about it. Come on, let's go. [Ian] Rick! Over here! Let's keep moving. Come on! How'd it go? All right? -They're fine. -No problems? No, not a one of 'em. It's been rough here, and no birds, sitting all alone. Yeah, that must have been rough. Where's the boat? Around the bend. Look. We'll sit here till night, then we get on the boat. Why? Because it's safer that way, that's why. Come on. [Vigo speaks Chinese] [shouts] [speaking Chinese] [speaks Chinese] So they killed Tai, eh? Never mind. Let the fools go. I can catch up with them any time I want to. This way Rick will lead me to where the nitra is. [melancholic music] There's something sacred in salt, for it is in our tears and in the sea. [uneasy music] Captain! There's a strange junk coming in! [Vigo] Captain! Oh captain! The harbor is closed! Quiet, girls! Why, how can the captain hear me? Swish your hips more, mate! Glide, glide! You're walking like a bleeding elephant! Look, limey, you swish your way and I'll swish mine, okay? Yoo-hoo! Captain! No bird ever squeaked like that, mate! Get your voice up. Up, up! [in a higher tone] Up! [Vigo] Oh captain! Beautiful. Beautiful. [Vigo] Oh captain! We've run out of diesel fuel. The girls are so restless. I'm sorry, but we're anxious to get to Hong Kong and we can't make it by sail this evening. [whispers] Push your chest out at him, mate! Push your chest out at him! [Vigo] Would you please help us, sir? The girls would be so grateful if we could get to the action of Hong Kong by tonight. We can't let them ladies run out of fuel in the middle of the South China Sea, captain. We'll be waiving the rules of the sea. It just wouldn't be gentlemanly. Someone bring a few tins of diesel fuel. Prepare to board the ladies' junk. [cheers] [captain] Put a line over here. Jimmie, Ian, tie 'em up! Vigo, check the hold! Yeah! Move! Now go! Hey Rick! Found me a chopper! We could use it. [speaking Chinese] Rick, there's nothing down here. You're slipping, Vigo. Very sweet, boys. Now you stay put and we'll be out of here in no time. Hey, look. Don't look now, but one of your nests is missing. -[laughs] -Gracious. Big mouth. You and your girls... [Rick] Take the maid and the captain below. -Oh father! -Oh daughter! They have come to slay the dragon. St. George, St. George, St. George, St. George. [speaks Chinese] [speaks Chinese] Thank you. Thank you. Nice to meet you, but I think we ought to get right to work. Show us where the cargo is. We moved it from the wrecked junk to our temple. Come with me! My daughter had the idea to remove the cargo from Patrai's junk. [gong] [total silence] [soft rustling] [Vigo] You mean to tell me you have those explosives here? [Chunhyang] Behind the altar, where our gods protect it from Patrai's eyes. Why, what's the matter? Rick, that stuff expands with heat, if it goes, this whole island disappears. [speaks Chinese] [Rick] Win Lim, get your people away from here. [Win Lim speaks Chinese] [baby crying] I would like to stay and help. Win Lim, you do as I told you. Take the women and the children down to the other side of the island. If anything goes wrong, they got a better chance of survival down by the rocks. But you? Well, we, uh... take our chances with the men of the village. Besides... I'm getting paid for it. Yes, St. George. [speaks Chinese] All right, let's get at it. Get the men lined up. [grunting] [indistinct chatter] [shouts] [tense music] [in Chinese] Better get out there and make sure they handle it carefully. -Go ahead. -Yeah, right. [chatter in Chinese] [Ian] Easy, lad! Easy, easy! Come on, easy, mate! Take it easy. Watch it there, mate! You'll blow us all to kingdom come. Take it nice and steady. Easy, easy. Easy, fellas. Take it nice and easy. Easy. Steady now. Hey, watch it, watch it. Take it easy. Easy. Gently. Gently. [chatter in Chinese] Come on, lads, come on. Take it nice and easy. Don't frustrate that bleeding stuff. Take it easy, mate! Gently. Watch it. Watch it, lad! [wood creaking] [wood creaking] [Vigo] Look out! Dammit! [breathing heavily] [shouts] Hey, limey! -[Ian] What do you want? -Get down here. There's a broken one here. Be careful. Careful. Watch it. Watch it, lads. Take it easy. C'mon. Take it easy. Just a few more, Jimmie. -Keep moving, buddy. Yeah. Right. [Rick in Chinese] How does it look, Vigo? -[Vigo] All right so far. -What do you think? Who's thinking? I'm praying. We gotta get this stuff back to Hong Kong. If you think that Portuguese is gonna let us get off easy, you're nuts. So you'll feather your nest and swivel your hips, love. You're beautiful. He is not my type. [man yells in Chinese] [chatter in Chinese] Partai! [ominous music] [Rick] Get back in the hold! Vigo, get up in the stern and watch. Go ahead! Hey, that makes two kegs -we got down there. -Yeah, now go ahead! Come on! Let's go, fellas! Hey Jimmie! Get the men on those nets! Make everything look perfectly normal and natural! Get somebody into a sampan and bring it around here right away! [shouting in Chinese] Rick, what are you gonna do now? I'm going to spit in the dragon's face before he can spit in ours. -Come on, let's go. -Okay. Go! Well... -Welcome aboard. -Thanks. -How've you been? Pretty good. How are you? Very well, thank you. How about a cigar, eh? Oh, no thanks. I use these. Listen, any kind you want. [chuckles] All right. Maybe a drink, eh? -Hey Patrai. -Hm? Uh... I didn't come here for cigarettes or drink. I came here to find out what you got in your mind. Hm... Listen, I'm sorry about your man getting killed the last time we met in Singapore. Look, you know the rules of salvage as well as I do. That nitra cargo belongs to those people out there. The only problem is getting it into Hong Kong, and, uh... that's why I'm here. I see. Now tell me, do you gamble? That depends on the stakes. Well, let's say for the moment, nitra-2. I see. All or nothing, huh? You know what the cargo is worth. You also know my chances of getting it are better than yours. How long you think you're going to last with only three men? As long as it takes for you to find the stuff. I got the upper hand now, because, um... -I know where it is. -[chuckles] Now, Rick... one word from me you would have been shot before you ever set foot in this boat. You are a humanitarian, Patrai. [chuckles] Yeah. You know what... That kind of money deserves a roll of the dice. Don't you think? [bullets clacking] -I think so. -[click] [click] Here. -Go ahead. -[whirring] You know... even if I won all that money, I wouldn't know what to do with it. I think... I think I'll stay with the deal I've got. Rick, as long as I'm here, you've got nothing. Tell you what. You show me where the cargo is, and I'll give you a finder's fee. Ten percent. That's a pretty good offer. How about 50 percent? [chuckles] A third. A third, and a guarantee on your life. And your guarantee is good, huh? The best. You know what? It's ironic. For once I tried to be legitimate. So what happens? That nitra is causing me more trouble than any cargo of whiskey or opium I ever hijacked. You mean that stuff is really theirs legitimately? Only the two of us know that. I see. Hey, hey. Listen. Why... Why are you hesitating? Now listen, this is a good deal I'm offering you. A third, Rick. A third of a cargo that is mine. Mine anyway. Come on. What do you say, huh? All right. I like the deal. -Good. -But... [sighs] Gotta talk to my men first. Oh sure, sure. You should discuss it with them. I'm sure they will see it our way. Tell you what. You... You take all the time you want. Take six hours. Thanks. And, ah, Rick... You try to play games with me, that whole island gets blown to hell. Hell, I gotta say thanks. A lot. Vamos? Yeah. These guys come on as strong. They fold fast. They got soft bellies, Rick. Yeah, and hard bullets. You know what we need on this island? Some real squeakers. Some nice bits of oriental fluff. You know, warm a man's heart and his-- Come on, Ian, this is no rub down. Patrai asked for a showdown. He offered us a deal. He gave us six hours to make up our minds. We, um... turn this stuff over to him and he cuts us in for a piece of the action. What kind of a deal is it, mate? A third. And no bullets. A third? That's the same kind of deal that this Win something or other offered, isn't it? -Yeah. -That's a good deal, isn't it? Yeah. Hey, what do you think, Vigo? I think Patrai is a lying bastard. You know better, Rick. We'll get a piece of the action, all right. We'll get a piece of the cemetery. What did you tell him, mate? I told him that I wanted... Hey... What the hell is going on in that temple? I told those women to stay away from this part of the island. It's the little bird, made her way back to the temple. That's a squeaker for you! They'll do it every time! It's only me. [sighs] St. George. I thought I told you to stay away from here. -I had to come back. -Why? To say a prayer to our gods. Yes, but prayers don't make any difference anymore. My father, and all of us, we have said you are like one of our people. Our own flesh and blood. I've got to tell you that, ah, that cargo is legitimate. It really belongs to you. Once in his life, Patrai didn't try to smuggle something. But don't keep it. Give it back to him. Give it back to Patrai. You say that? Yes, because I don't want to see your people hurt. We are only hurt if you are hurt. Patrai doesn't hurt to get what he wants. He destroys. One cannot destroy what is the truth. For then one only destroys himself. [Rick] Patrai offered us a... settlement if... we turned the stuff over to him. Would that be a settlement with honor, my brother? "My brother"? [chuckles] Wow. Almost had... other things in mind. Flesh of my flesh. You know what... There's so much that a... that a man can take. Hey limey, how's it look down there? It won't be easy, mates. She's dove in on the port side. We'll have to raise her from the bottom and begin from there. All right, let's get busy. Where are the rest of the villagers? The women and children have returned. Patrai will see no change till he casts his eyes in our direction. Bring some of the men down here, I'm gonna need a little help. Perhaps fate has destined the original boat to continue the voyage it started. Yeah, well I hope fate is right. Let's try the rigging block and tackle! See if we can get this mother off her tail. Come on, let's go! [shouts] [indistinct speech] Rick, so what, are we salvaging stuff? We should transfer it from your junk to this one and sail out the back way, and then Patrai finds out. What do you think he's gonna do when he finds out he's been had? Cry a little. [Vigo] Rick, slowly! Slow! Slow! Pull! She's coming up! Pull! Rick, pull! Take it easy! take it easy! [all grunting] [all] Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! [Vigo] Pull! Take it easy! She's coming! Pull! Easy! [all] Pull! [wood creaking] -Pull! -[mixed shouts] Hold it! [Rick] How does it look under there? It's bad, mate. The typhoon snatched a piece of her tail. Petrai and his bloody luck, wouldn't you know it. Keep working at it. Do the best you can. Get some of the men to shore this up. Yeah. Right. St. George. You keep looking at me like that. How should I look at you? Not like that. Do my eyes say something wrong? Let's say they make me nervous. You are my brother. Well, I... like I said. Wow. [cup and saucer rattle] Yeah. [suspenseful music] I don't like it. Rick Masters is not on his boat. He's got to be someplace around here. Arturo, split up your men. Hatoi name, come with me. Get her up. I want her to tell me where everybody is. [speaks Chinese] [Patrai speaks Chinese] [speaks Chinese] [speaks Chinese] Pretty child. Such a lovely face. Eyes like... shining stars. Hair... like silk. Like silk. [speaks Chinese] [speaks Chinese] [Rick] You looking for me? Yes. I'm always looking for something. For someone. This time, you. [Rick] You said six hours. You're early. Oh yes, it's... one of my many virtues. Always on time. Never keep my host waiting. Something tells me that... you don't trust me, Patrai. Oh. What a cruel thing to say. [laughs] Ah, smoke? Ah, no thank you, I'll smoke one of mine. Rolled under special conditions for me. You see... handpicked. Hand-rolled. One grows into his habits. It's a habit out of my reach. Would you like a drink? [Patrai] No, no. Thank you. You spoke to your men? Yeah, I spoke to them. And? Well, it's like a hung jury: two for, two against. That's the way it is. Which side are you on? Oh, come on, now. We gotta have some secrets from each other, shall we? Now, Rick... Rick, I told you. Don't play games with me. You play games with Patrai, you get hurt. You get hurt dead. Yes, but it's a democracy. I've got to give my men a freedom of choice. You know, it's like you said, there's an awful lot of money involved here. And maybe... -Maybe... -[cup thumps] only one of us ought to sail away from here alone with it. Like I said... I know where it is. You mean... Now, you listen to me. I'm warning you. Patience is not one of my virtues. Yes, I'm well aware of that. However... gambling is. And I think... that, uh... I ought to reciprocate in kind. [gun clicks] The same game. If there's any consolation, there were no bullets in my gun. I figured that was your breed. Tonight... you may have a consolation prize. [click] -What consolation? -[gun chamber whirrs] Oh, you, um... fired the first shot last time, didn't you? [Patrai] That's right. Oh, come on! I don't believe you. You may be a lot of things, but you're not self-destructive. Test me. All right. Go ahead. Go ahead! [sighs] [click] Shall we try for two? [click] [click] How do I know it's nitra? You don't. [click] Round and round we go. Could be this one. [click] [click] Or this one. [click] [click] Oh, you're beautiful. You really are. [Rick] There won't be enough of us left for them to bury. Now, you listen to me! You made a deal, you are going to keep it. One whistle, one whistle my men will be here in a second! Go ahead, whistle! This is the last one. All right. You win this round. When the stars go out of the sky, and the sun comes out, I'll be back. Oh, I'll be back. [tense music] [shouts] [gunshot] Everybody! Back to the boats! [speaking Chinese] How does it look, Jimmie? Pretty good, I hope. You know, we'd better check the caulking on both sides. Okay. [hammering continues] [rumbling] [wood creaks] [Vigo] Look out! Look out! Ian! Get some help! Get some help! Come on, get in here! -Hey, get in! -[all shouting] -[confused shouts] -[Vigo] Pull him out! Lift! Lift! Lift it, boys! Push it! -[all yelling] -[wood creaking] [Rick] What happened? The rope busted. I was wrong. [sobs] I was wrong. [Jimmie] I'm all right, mate. What are you doing? [suspenseful music] [mournful music] Stars are gone from the sky. Life has gone from a friend. These islands... a funeral always has its mourners. They're in the temple offering a prayer to their gods. Look, Patrai... I'm tired, I've had it. The cargo is yours. Take it. Just give my share to the villagers. Now that you've got what you wanted, I'm taking him back to Hong Kong. Sure, sure, but... tell me how did he die. What does that matter? It's gone, it's over with. Death always matters. Well you killed him, old buddy. Go and believe that. You. Your boat, your junk that washed ashore with your cargo during the typhoon. It killed him. [sighs] I don't blame you for looking like that. Here's the big laugh. We were salvaging that washed-up wreck. Gonna load it up and sail it out of here the way they sailed it in, only... only it crashed down, and he got... pinned under it. Right. Never thought of that. And you could have done it. Pretty gutsy, pretty smart. Yeah, thanks. Goodbye. And amen. I want one moment. In respect for the dead, I'd like to say a prayer. Oh, if you can dig one up out of hell, go ahead and say a prayer. It's a custom among these people when they say a prayer for the dead, they say it to the dead. Now, Rick... Peace be with him. Look, I... I hate to... Don't be embarrassed. Business as usual. Crates are stacked up in the shack down there. Well... I don't want to sound commercial-- It's all right. You can check 'em out. Okay. Arturo. Get some men. Go check 'em out. [thump] With no disrespect for the dead, of course. Of course. You know, I... I can't figure you out. Giving your cut to the villagers. [Arturo] Stuff's here, all right. Check the stenciling. [Arturo] Okay. Yeah, it's ours, all right. Open them up. [Arturo] All right. Hold on. [loud boom] -[shouting] -[dramatic music] [Jimmie] Rick! I'll take care of the guys in the boat! [gunfire] [gunfire] Make another move and you get a bullet right in your throat. Ian! Watch the wreck, get the motor going! Jimmie! Vigo, cover me! I'll make a run for the junk! [Vigo] Okay! We'd better get out of here. Take a small boat trip together. Don't try anything funny. -I wouldn't think of it. -[firing continues] Now! [cocks gun] Get up! Hold your fire, or Patrai gets one right in the head! [Ian shouts] Get the engines going! Come one! [engine splutters] [engine splutters] Vigo, Jimmie! Get behind me. Ah! Get down to the engine room, quick! Come on! All right baby, sing for daddy! [engine splutters] You like my company, eh? Couldn't do without it. And a long way to go. You're gonna be with me all the way, buddy. [Vigo] Jimmie! Clear the jets, come on! [indistinct] [engine splutters] [Rick shouts] -Come on, baby! -[engine splutters] [gunshot] [Jimmie] No more ammo, Rick! Tell them to stop firing. You've had it, Rick. Saw what happened to that shack. It'll happen to you! Call them off. Oh, you're funny, you really are. You're standing right over that cargo. It's all around you! [firing continues] Go on. If you still think it's funny, go ahead and laugh. Make a hell of a noise. [Vigo] Rick, behind you! [groans] Tell them to call it off! [whispers] Last time. Tell them to call it off. [firing continues] [engine whirrs] Oh, that sounds beautiful! [shouts] I love you! Hey, let's go! Come on! Are we ready to go? All set! She's running! -Let her roll! -[Ian shouts] Vigo! Keep me covered! Got it. Jimmie, cut it loose! [Ian] Right-ho! [indistinct speech] Oh... there. Come on, baby! Let's go! [engine roars] [tranquil music] [repeated thumps] What the hell? Not again! There you are. Rick, my friend... I heard it was your birthday. I came to congratulate you. You know, somehow, it seems to me that you had a birthday only last week. Yes, and sometimes twice a week. I see. [chuckles] Nice birthday present you got. I haven't had time to unwrap it yet. No hard feelings, huh? Hm? No, no. You got paid to do a job, it's you line of work. Maybe someday you do a job for me, eh? I like you. I do. And I like your style. Oh... celebrate. Have fun. Make a wish. You're welcome. Goodnight. [jazzy music] [dramatic music]
