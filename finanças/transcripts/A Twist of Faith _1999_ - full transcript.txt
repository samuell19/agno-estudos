GIRL: You can'’t catch me! BOY: Wait for me, Valerie. [GIGGLING] Wait for me! Come on, Alex, this way! Valerie, come back! You aren'’t scared, are you? Valerie! No, Valerie! Don'’t go! [GLASS SMASHES] Valerie! BOY: Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee... [CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] Hi, baby. How'’s our girl? Uh... What? The results of the blood test finally came in. She could die, Henry. Daddy? Daddy? Sweetheart. Oh, how you feeling? How you feeling, hmm? What are you doing up? I'’m scared.Of what? The angel. Angels? There'’s an angel standing by my window. Where? Here? Let'’s see. Oh, I don'’t see it anymore. I think you'’re okay. Let'’s get you back in bed. [CAMERA CLICKS] So I guess mass is canceled. Hello, Henry. Frankovich. New job, same old suit. I got a new tie. Lovely. How bad is it? I hope you didn'’t have a big breakfast. In fact, I brought you a doughnut. It'’s tofu. What the hell is tofu anyway? I think it'’s some kind of soybean. A freaking soy doughnut? No, thanks. It'’s a millennial thing. Fingerpainting compared to what'’s waiting inside. This way. Pontius Pilate is back. Yesterday we had one really happy old priest. Some mission of theirs just got funding. Look at this. This asshole stopped to take a leak on the way out. He even lifted the seat. I don'’t think that'’s it. I mean, he'’s leaning here. I think he threw up. Medical report confirms water in martin'’s lungs. Thank you. He must have dunked his face in the holy water. What'’s on the tape? The fist half is just Martin practicing his next sermon. And the rest? We get the picture. No, wait.[REWINDS TAPE] There'’s a second voice here. [MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [REPEATING ANGRILY] That'’s him? Yeah. What the hell does he say? [REWINDING] [MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [REPEATING ANGRILY] [LAST WORD ECHOING] [MUSIC PLAYING, MUFFLED] ♪ ...Long too sad and lonely ♪ Never have to say you'’re sorry ♪ Never have to tell a lie ♪ '’Cause now you're my one and only ♪ Everything we have we'’ll share... ♪ When did you blow in? Wow. My day was great, yeah. How was your day? How long you staying, Robert? I got a job downtown. Uh, a few days. Yeah? Let'’s check out the embroidery, huh? Ahem. It'’s been 3 1/2 months I'’ve been clean, Henry. Call next time. [DOOR CLOSES] WOMAN: He is your brother, Henry. It'’s not the best timing in the world, is it? Well, Shannon likes having him around. Did he go to the hospital today? Yeah. It'’s nice having some family close. Didn'’t you promise Shannon you'’d quit? I have quit, Beth. So when is this time off gonna happen? I'’ll take the weekend off. It'’s Saturday. Which weekend? Six Kees, Colombian. My finest. [ECHOING] Finest. Stop! Police! Jack! Okay! Okay! No one has to get hurt here. Latin? That gibberish was Latin? Yeah, it was Latin. And then the tape runs out right before the killer completes the sentence. So what'’s he saying? [MAN SPEAKING LATIN] It means "If you'’re so powerful, then you would destroy me." I thought it meant "You'’d stop me." Either way, he didn'’t take kindly to Father Martin. Maybe he was speaking to the police. Thank you. Did, um, Father Martin have any enemies? I'’d say he wasn't entirely scrupulous about where our donations came from. And some zealot might take exception to that? Murder might be a bit extreme. I thought Father Martin was very highly regarded. Very. He was popular. Some even expect a miracle, his return from the dead. The sad irony is is that his death has brought in more money than ever. Suddenly there'’s enormous eagerness to give. People who don'’t normally give God the time of day now throwing us scraps to ease their conscience. I thought that was the point of donation. God is not for sale. It cheapens what we do. I see. Doesn'’t the church depend on funding for its mission work? I'’d like to have more than the pittance we get, but if people give for the wrong reasons, then we shouldn'’t accept it. That'’s a very admirable attitude. Is that what you and Father Martin argued about? Do you fight with your wife, detective? Sometimes. Do you kill her afterward? People do. In such a perverse society, a wound is not the symptom. A wound is a wound. An ulcer is an ulcer. A festering abrasion, a festering abrasion. You lost me after the ulcer, Father. So what do you think? I think we ought to fingerprint the creep right now and get it over with. On what probable cause? You know, unless you know where it is, that bathroom is kind of hard to find, isn'’t it? Especially when you'’re about to throw up. Let me ask you something. So say Hitler repented two seconds before he died. Does that mean that he'’s in Heaven right now plucking Beethoven on a harp? Hitler listened to Wagner. Come on, help me out here with these Catholics. You'’re asking me? Well, you'’re Jewish, aren'’t you? That'’s, like, half Catholic. Which half? So you confess, and that'’s it. Your slate is just wiped clean. It doesn'’t make any sense to me. WOMAN: It takes faith. I beg your pardon? Something we all need right now. You shouldn'’t be in here, miss. I work here. I'’m Monica Stoeks. Sorry. This is detective Smith. I'’m Frankovich. We'’re hoping to talk to you. I'’d be glad to help you, but right now I'’m trying to help Father Samuels get this place back to normal. When would be a good time? Perhaps after Father Martin'’s memorial service tomorrow. You'’re welcome to attend. Then you can question me the day after tomorrow. Yeah, that'’ll be fine. Thanks. Miss Stoeks. Are you thinking what I'’m thinking? You know, why do I got to feel like crap '’cause I don't go to church, huh? That'’s not what I was thinking. I was thinking for a Catholic, she'’s major boink material. Boink? Which one of you dicks is responsible for the leak? Why would we do that, chief? We might make money. A crucified old priest, and you guys are comedians? Jokes are a defense mechanism, chief. Frankovich started therapy, sir. Been to five sessions. I find it very helpful. What'’s the deal on the prints and the hair samples? Not identifiable. The guy has never had a criminal record. It narrows the suspects down to a couple of hundred million, tops. I need more, Smith. Something kosher. Kosher? That'’s Hebrew, chief. That'’s the wrong religion. Get back to work. So why did he dunk the priest in the holy water when he could have just killed him and gotten it over with? Come on, Henry. He'’s a sick schmuck and he liked to make the guy suffer. If he likes to make him suffer, then why'’s he throwing up afterward? So what'’s the motive? I don'’t know. The guy's trying to make some kind of statement. What'’s the name of that self-help book? I'’m okay, you're okay? No. When bad things happen to good people. You know, you'’re starting to sound like one of those shrinks that Rourke brings in. Hey, guys. I could really fix you up. Twenty bucks. Come on, guys. Give a girl a break. Please, guys? We could have a party. At least tell me you'’re gonna spend it on food. Thanks a lot. You ever gonna light that thing? Don'’t ride me. I'’m halfway to self-improvement. Systematic elimination of vices, huh? Something like that. Yeah. [SIREN] [FRANKOVICH DISTORTED] Okay! Okay! No one has to get hurt here. I'’m gonna blow you to Jesus land, Jack. Now! HENRY: You have this, Maxie? Maxie! Maxie, keep breathing! Maxie, keep breathing. Maxie! If you'’re so powerful, stop it. [BELL CLANGING] [LIGHTER FLICKS] If the bell bothers you, I got some tunes. Lots of my customers can'’t get into it with that bell clanging away out there. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] You okay? You seem a little tense. Oh! Oh. One of those strong silent types, huh? Well, this will definitely ease your suffering. Uh, hey, lover. You just paid a lot of bucks for a lousy view. Are you listening? Oh, today'’s a very special day for me, So I'’m gonna give you a little something extra. Lucky for you. Maybe you'’d like a little show. Here she comes... Ooh! [GIGGLES] ♪ Miss America I long to put my sister through college. No shit. Um, look, buddy, are you in or out? How'’d you know my name? This is me. [WHISPERS] Mary. Where did you get these? Did my old man send you? What do you want from me? Oh... Please no! No! HENRY: Pass me that, will you? Hello, Henry. Meet Mary Singer. No record of junk abuse, no enemies... No psycho pimp, no nothing. But this Mary ain'’t no virgin. What'’s the name of that prostitute in the Bible? Mary Magdalene. No one heard anything? In this place? You have a cause of death? Probably asphyxiation. The strands under the pillow were hers. He must have smothered her first and then gagged her with the nylons. Like the priest in the holy water... Killing with the tools of the trade. What? She made her living on her back, didn'’t she? There'’s plenty of his hair here, too. She must have been on top. You are sick. That'’s a defense mechanism. This doesn'’t make any sense. What is there, ten, 15 grand here? Yup. Well, if that'’s the going rate, I am definitely in the wrong business. It smells in here. Whoa. Just leave those right here. That'’s fine. [MONITOR BEEPING] [SQUEAKS AS IT HITS FLOOR] [TAPPING] Sweetheart. Sweetheart, what are you doing out of bed? The angel came back. She was standing by the window. Oh, that'’s just the radiator, honey. Come on. Let'’s put you into bed now. But you mean there'’s really no angels, Daddy? Uncle Robert said that I can talk to them. Did he? He said if I did this, they'’d listen to me and make me better. Well, the doctors are sure gonna make you better. That'’s for sure. Do you know how to pray, Daddy? Will you pray for me? Um, sure. Of course. Angels, please make Shannon all better soon. Okay, you go to sleep, okay? Good night, Daddy. Good night. [BELL TOLLING] STOEKS: Detective. HENRY: Afternoon. It'’s okay. I invited him. Lunchtime is a very busy time around here, detective Smith. I'’ll try and stay out of the way, Father. I needed to talk to you. About what? The murdered prostitute. Mary Singer. They never give us their real names. That was hers. As you know, we run a number of outreach programs to get girls off the street. She reminds me of a girl that left us about a week ago, said she was going straight. Father Samuels doesn'’t remember her, but I do. We have so many missions. Do you have any files or photos? We hold a number of personal items, but we have no real system of keeping track. Let me ask you a question, miss Stoeks. What happens to the money? It goes to feed the poor all over the world. We do the best we can with the limited funding we get from the Hunt Foundation. Oh. Huh! "Limited." Well, let'’s just call it peanuts compared to what he spends on his sports heroes. Thanks for your time. Give it a rest, Henry. Go home. You ever seen shit like this before? Not since my bar mitzvah. You see the darnedest thing on the web, don'’t you, Henry? You know, personally, I hate this technology. I hate it. I like the old ways. Maybe the money was Mary Singer'’s savings. Think she was retiring? I don'’t know. The priest got it when he was celebrating. Maybe Singer was quitting for a better life. Not too many hookers carry family portraits to work. What the hell was she doing with these? HENRY: Think he knew her? I don'’t know, Henry. "This is your life, Mary Singer." Go home. [BRAKES SCREECH] I'’ve got Santiago's car in lot "D." HENRY: All he needs is a crown of thorns. Fits the pattern, though. Somebody does something good, they get it real bad. What was in his throat? Sand, from the pitcher'’s mound. There was a lot of it in his lungs, too. Kind of makes it tough to breathe. Santiago'’s time of birth also aligns within minutes with the same Earth, Sun, and Moon rising of Christ'’s birth. Now, these forces more accurately reflect character than our zodiac signs. By attacking the heroes of our society, the killer is really attacking our value systems and our concepts of religion. I didn'’t realize the prostitute was a hero. For 15 grand, she must have been pretty heroic. The killer sees himself as the Antichrist, stopping the Second Coming. He'’s sure that Christ would return as a person on these dates, using the Earth, Sun, and Moon theory. I'’ve got a moon for all this and it'’s hairy and it'’s not very pretty. What'’s next, chief? Letters from Santa? You think that'’s funny, Frankovich? It'’s not bad. How many more experts are we gonna sit through? You'’re one stupid cop, Smith. Yes, sir. Gentlemen, would you, uh, excuse us? Get out of here, Frankovich. Why don'’t you get off his back, chief? Is this still about your nephew? This is still about Maxie? You want to blame somebody, blame me. Frankovich. It wasn'’t Henry'’s fault. Enough. I got to level with you, Smith. We'’re a few weeks away from new budgets. It'’s gonna mean cuts again. Who you gonna replace me with? Put James on the case. James is a month from retirement. You got one more week, Smith. I'’m sorry about Maxie. His death is with me every day. [BELL TOLLING] HENRY: Morning. Working on a Sunday, detective? I'’m afraid so. Listen, I am still trying to find out what it is exactly that Samuels and Father Martin argued about that day. You don'’t give up, do you? Well, miss Stoeks, the killer obviously had an ax to grind with Father Martin. He knew where the bathroom was in the church, and like Samuels, he was not very fond of Raul Santiago. This is a letter written by Samuels about Santiago that appeared in the paper. Father Samuels just thinks high sports salaries could be used for other things. Oh? Like what? People are starving all over the world, detective. So why send missionaries? Why not just send more food? What about their spiritual guidance? It'’s hard to be spiritual when you'’re hungry. You really don'’t believe in what we'’re doing, do you? I believe in what I can see, what I can touch. Doesn'’t leave much room for God. I don'’t know how I can help, detective. But it seems strange to me... An atheist tracking down a man of misguided faith. Detective Henry Smith, sir. Thank you.Thank you, Helen. it'’s a pleasure to finally meet you. You'’re in my newspapers almost every day, circling crime scenes like some magnificent bird of prey. Heh! No one'’s ever described me with such vivid colors before, sir. Well, I am a publisher. Wow. This is quite something. The view must be very nice from up here, sir. You said you wanted to talk to me about Raul. Yes. Do you know anyone who would want to cause him any harm? He was loved by everybody. A great ball player, detective. There'’ll never be another one like him. I don'’t follow baseball much anymore, but I imagine for ten million a season, he must have been quite something. He sent most of that to the Caribbean. So I read. Still, it must be a very difficult tragedy for you to accept. Well, acceptance is my only solution. Without it, I'’m left with rage, aren'’t I? Monica. Uh, detective, have you met miss Stoeks? Miss Stoeks. Detective Smith. Of course, Mr. Hunt is a contributor to the church. We were just finishing up. And we were just discussing something that I'’m sure is far from your mind... Rage. Rage doesn'’t give us anything. My sentiments exactly. These will need your signature, too, my darling. My pleasure to come back later in the day, sir. I apologize, detective. Right here. I'’ve had these books sent up from the company library. I hope they can be of some assistance. Religious persecution, drawn up as the acts occurred, sort of like humanity'’s first newspapers. This actually happened? Well, I'’m afraid that when it comes to faith, there are no limits to man'’s cruelty to man. STOEKS: Man is cruel. That makes faith sublime. That'’s interesting. With all your firsthand experience, detective, what'’s your opinion on the matter? Which, sir? Faith. Well, I'’m a bit of a cynic, sir. I'’ve seen a little too much deliberate cruelty to have much faith in anything. STOEKS: God'’s responsible for both suffering and good, detective. You can'’t have one without the other. I'’m sure you're absolutely right, miss Stoeks. If I can offer you some advice, detective, be objective. I'’m an atheist, sir. How much more objective can I be? Ah. Everybody has a mask they hide their fear behind, whether they'’re believers or not and whether they call it God or not. Mr. Hunt... You don'’t strike me as a power-hungry man, and yet you'’re one of the most powerful people in the country. How is that? [SIGHS] Power is knowledge. I always thought it was the other way around. No, I don'’t think so. Thanks for your time. ALEX: When it comes to faith, there are no limits to man'’s cruelty. ALEX: Everybody has a mask... [ECHOING DISTORTEDLY] SHANNON: Mommy. [MAN SPEAKING LATIN] SHANNON: Daddy. Daddy. Sweetheart, yeah. What'’s the matter? What'’s the matter? Am I gonna die, Daddy? What? Am I? Sweetheart, what... what... Where'’d you hear that? What'’s death like? It'’s... it's like... A big, long sleep. I'’m so scared, Daddy. I know. Hey. Remember the story that I told you about God? Yes, in Heaven. That'’s right, honey. Sometimes God comes down, takes you up to Heaven. If he does, it'’s okay '’cause Heaven... '’Cause Heaven's a wonderful place. Can I talk to you? Sure. HENRY: Okay, baby. I'’ll be right back, okay? Hello, sweetheart.Hi. I'’d appreciate if you'd stop playing father to my little girl. Someone has to. Sorry. I didn'’t mean that. You know, everywhere I turn lately, there'’s God staring me in the face. [GRUNTS] That'’s because he's ubiquitous, Henry. Yeah, I don'’t care if he's as big as the Titanic and glows like a lava lamp. It'’s a friggin' crutch, Robert. People can'’t deal with what happens, so they invent God. So how do you deal with it? I'’m here, aren't I? Oh, yeah, that again. What else is there, Robert? I mean, you don'’t really believe all that born-again crap, do you? I'’m just trying to find something, Henry. Yeah? What? Ah, something... Something we never had in our dysfunctional family, Henry, that'’s what.Oh, Robert. What didn'’t we have in our family? Come on. What else is there except... Responsibility, showing up? Oh, you see? No, don'’t. Don'’t lecture me, okay? You know, half the time I don'’t know if you'’re dead or alive or doped out on some street corner somewhere? You'’re sober for ten lousy minutes, you'’re gonna tell me how to run my life. Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you, Henry? Look around you. Your daughter'’s in there dying and you can'’t even deal with it. Get out of here, Robert. Leave my family alone. I'’m sorry, bro. [SCOFFS] Everything'’s gonna be okay, Henry. You took care of me when I was down and out, and, uh... Now I'’m gonna help take care of you. [DISTANT SIRENS] [DISTANT CAR ALARM BLARING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] SAMUELS: This is for your own good. Get away from me. This is the last time. Just stay away from me. [INDISTINCT] Give it to me! No!Let her go, asshole. You all right? Thanks. You'’ve messed up, Father. [GRUNTS] Get up. I'’m not pressing charges. I need you to. Otherwise, I can'’t fingerprint him. I'’m sorry. I can'’t. Honey, I'’ve already done it. Well, then, you shot your load prematurely. Like half of my johns. I feel sorry for you, detective Smith. For men like you, who never find any more meaning in their lives than tossing some misfit behind bars and then finding the nearest coffee shop to talk about it. Good night. FRANKOVICH: Prints don'’t match the killer'’s. Samuels is clean. So, I fingerprinted a priest for stopping a hooker from shooting up. I would have done the same thing, Henry. You didn'’t have a choice. I bought you a gourmet coffee, Henry. The right color and everything. I like this. So, what'’s our profile so far? Well, the killer hates nice people. Heh. Or religious people. And he doesn'’t need any money. What is this? Come on, Henry. Lighten up a little, will you? My wife says that. You'’ve been working around the clock. Take a break. Yeah. The killer isn'’t taking one. You know, I know it doesn'’t make any sense, but I feel like... If I crack this thing, the rest of my life will just fall into place. That doesn'’t make any friggin'’ sense, does it? No, Henry, it doesn'’t. [MONITORS BEEPING STEADILY] Computers. Hunt, huh? What are you looking for? Dirt. And anything contrary to public opinion. Why? '’Cause he fits in here somewhere. He'’s either the killer or the next victim. I'’d say the latter. Five hundred grand donated to help women in India start their own businesses. Not exactly my idea of dirt, Henry. Look at this. Quarter of a million to a blindness research fund. [SCOFFS] I could dig up more shit on Mother Teresa. Alexander Hunt is a saint.Yeah. A saint with his finger in every pie. Mr. Hunt, I'’m sorry to barge in...Detective Smith. Helen. Thanks. I'’ve left several messages. It'’s been a very busy time for me, detective. I'’m sorry. I'll only take a minute of your time. I was wondering if you recognize this person. No. Should I? She'’s Mary Singer. She was the victim before Santiago. The prostitute with the $15,000 john. Are you here to talk about this young lady or Santiago? To tell you the truth, sir, I'’m not entirely sure. Maybe even Father Martin. You see, you'’re one of the few people who had contact with several of the victims. So there must be some kind of connection? Let me see, I give the victims, one of them, a very close friend of mine, a great deal of money, and then I kill them. Is that what you'’re implying? Is that it? Touche, sir. I'’m... I'm like an old dog. I just sniff under every tree. Well, detective, I remember you as a magnificent bird. And now you tell me you'’re a dog. Which is it? Mr. Smith... You speak of a cruel and disgusting world. Alex is the one person I know who'’s built an empire by his own hand. Never in my life have I met someone so driven to help people. Yep. It'’s pretty clear he'’s a saint. If I were you, Mr. Smith... It would seem obvious to me that Alex could be the next victim. I don'’t know why you'’re so cynical. Heh. Something must be really hurting you. Please take this. No, thanks. It was Father Martin'’s. His example gave me strength. Made me realize that pain was only fleeting. And sometimes when things are the worst, the best is the only one step in front of you. That'’s how God works. I'’ll keep that in mind. Please do. ROURKE: You ever hear the word motivation, Smith? No one teach you that at dick school? I'’m getting all this flack from the top. I was following a lead, chief. Alex Hunt is one of the city'’s most respected citizens. For Christ'’s sake, he could even be the next victim. You ever look him in the eye? Look me in the eye, Smith. What do you see? Badge. What, are you kidding? I'’m suspending you for two weeks. You'’re off the case. Now, give me your God damn badge. This is not about Hunt. It'’s about Maxie. Fine. Give it to James. Or pin it on some junkie in time for the budget cuts. There'’s enough dirt under this rug to grow a friggin'’ tree. DR. RACHMARAN: I do feel that with a procedure like this he would be the best person to bring in. Hi. Sorry I'’m late. Hi. How'’s our girl? I was just explaining to Beth that Dr. Ramachandarin is an expert in the world of marrow work, but unfortunately there is no way we can bring him in without a benefactor. No, I thought that... The police fund isn'’t covering the shortfall in the health plan. But please, don'’t worry. There is a list of people that we can contact in situations like this. And we are going to do everything that we can for Shannon. I'’ll be just over there if you have any more questions. Okay? Thank you. Thank you, doctor.

[TICKING] SAMUELS: I'’m so sorry about your colleague. And in my church? Such evil. Just tell me what you remember about this evening, Father. Well... Your detective came around claiming someone invited him here. What time? 7:30. Maybe 8:00. He asked some questions and then left. I never saw him again. How did he get in the church? We leave our doors open all the time. Trusting of you. The House of God is open to everyone. Who else is here at night? Just the janitor, who discovered the body. Pulanski'’s taking his statement. What about miss Stoeks? On Wednesday, she works at the East side Mission. She never came in. I would hate to implicate anyone, especially with you, Smith, but there was the new boy. He came to us about two weeks ago. A drifter. Offered community work in exchange for room and board. Community work at the missions? Yes. So he had access to your files, then. I suppose. But he did have another day job. Did he have a name? They don'’t give their names. They'’re street kids. Children who fell through the floorboards. He disappeared this morning. What did he look like? Older than the usual ones. Mid, maybe late 20s. Short, messy hair. Is that all? He was a strange-looking one. Compared to what? [SIGHS] Hmm. Kid must have been in a big hurry to forget that brush. We could use a break. Let'’s hope the samples match, huh? All right. Give me a call tomorrow. What? Wait a minute. Time of death doesn'’t match. It'’s not even close. Maybe it'’s not supposed to be. Well, so what? He smashed the watch and set it to 3:00? I don'’t know. I'’ll see you tomorrow. ROURKE: The killer must want you in charge, Smith. And why not? He'’d never get caught. Thanks for the warm welcome back, chief. You'’re not back yet. You want him to continue, chief? Hit me. James was dead before he was strung up. The guy'’s meticulous. He never deviates from his routine. And you know all about this... James'’s retirement watch. I don'’t get it. The killer purposely set the time to 3:00. The time of Christ'’s death, according to the Bible. 3:00 p.m., exactly 2,000 years ago. This ain'’t Sunday school, Smith. Tomorrow'’s Good Friday, chief. You figure it out. All that from a crummy, broken watch, huh? I don'’t believe this. A good cop murdered a few weeks before retirement. You guys throw all this apocalyptic bullshit at me. Good to be back, chief. Hi, Smith.Hello, Lou. Hello, John. [FAINT WHISPERING] Henry. Thank you. You know, I just stand here for hours just looking at our little girl. And all I want is to be able to go in there when I want and touch her, to feel her near me. And I can'’t. I would like to be able to believe that there is a reason that she'’s in there. What'’s this? I'’m back on the case. That maniac is calling the shots, he'’s controlling everything I do. He can'’t control everything, Henry. Henry? The hair samples match the killer'’s. It'’s the kid. I'’m gonna send a sketch artist over to Samuels. We have six hours. Honey, I'’ll be right home. Nice work, Frankovich!Yeah. [DOOR OPENS]Henry? We got him, sweetheart.

You didn'’t come here to lecture me, did you? We don'’t have a lot of time. Look, you'’re my big brother. I need to know why. Oh, come on. I'’m finding it a little hard to understand, Robert. Your idea of a joke? Talk to me, Robert. I figured with ten years experience in the business as a police officer, you would somehow be a better one, Henry, especially since you devoted your entire life to it. [SIGHS] I will get you a lawyer. Henry... How much time do you think I'’ll get for petty theft? What? For the money... it was like 1,000 bucks or something. How much?What money, Robert? In the bag that I stole. Do you think you'’re in here for theft, Robert? Where'’d you get that? Is that yours, Robert? That was in the bag that I stole, but I left it behind. Ahem. Look, this... This, uh, this jerk, he fires me for no reason at the club I'’m working at. So, I'’m leaving, right? And, uh, all of a sudden, there'’s this bag there with, like, a wad of cash in it. So I took it, '’cause I thought it was his. [EXHALES] Look, ahem. That'’s why you ran. Why do you think? Look, I just turned stupid, that'’s all. I just turned stupid. I'’m sorry. I'’m your brother, Henry. I'’m not a killer. All right. All right. I'’ll figure it out. I'’ll take care of it. Henry, whoa. You gonna tell me what'’s going on here? I wish I knew. Somebody is messing with me. That kid had nothing to do with this. [EXHALES] Something'’s been bothering me. Read this. What? Hunt. Just read it. It happened when they were kids. But Hunt accepted the blame for the accident, for the girl'’s coma, even for her death two years later. And then, Hunt spent the rest of his childhood in foster homes, institutions, even a monastery. How'’d you get this? The old way. Microfilm. [DRAW SQUEAKS OPEN] That'’s tragic. [TURNS ON] Don'’t play that again, Henry. Think about the words. [MAN SPEAKING LATIN] What if he isn'’t speaking to the priest or the police? What if he'’s talking to God? What do you mean? Like challenging God? His childhood home where it happened. You have the address?Yeah. [DISTANT SIREN] [ENGINE STARTS] [TIRES SQUEAL] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] Uhh! [DOOR SQUEAKS] CHILD: Wait for me. [FAINT WHISPERS] [LAUGHTER] CHILD: Come on, Alex. Come play. Come back. You aren'’t scared, are you? [COUGHS] [SIGHS] Jesus. Oh![EXHALES] [RUSSIAN ACCENT] Who are you, mister? Police. That don'’t mean nothing here. This is private property. Sorry. What is this? It'’s blood. You should have seen it 30 years ago. So bad. No one wanted to stay, so... He just boarded up the place. This where Alex Hunt grew up? Alex Hunt? Did he live here? He said you'’d come. Uh... What are you looking for? I'’m trying to stop a murder. This way. I want to show you something. This religious stuff his? Museum for God. Heh. They were praying a lot. That'’s for sure. Kind of had to be if you know their life. [GIRL LAUGHING] What was his relationship to that girl... Valerie Hill? They were in love. Kind of young, weren'’t they? I can tell you it was no puppy love, if that'’s what you'’re inferring. Both of them are different from the others. Never could forget. Like old folks are when they'’re together a long time. What about the accident? BOY: Valerie... Alex and I used to go down to the river park. It was winter. I guess he thought it was safe to walk on the ice. Well, it weren'’t, and Valerie fell through. [ICE CRACKING] And Alex watched her, trapped there under the ice. He went in after her, but it was too late. Kind of like... A baptism of ice. GIRL: Alex! Help me! She was in a coma for two years. Two years of Alex praying for her. You could see him here through the window. Sometimes all night. Just sitting here looking out and praying. Praying for her. Praying for himself. No, don'’t. BOY: Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners... Both of them frozen stiff. Carried her all the way back from the river. She went into her coma right there. Horrible thing for a young girl. Far more horrible for a 12-year-old to shoulder the blame. He lost her forever. GIRL: Alex! Help me! Please don'’t leave me. Poor Alex. Just praying and praying. And praying at night. What happened in the other room? I can'’t tell you. Look, I need to know everything. It could save someone'’s life. Blood'’s his mama's. There was a call from the hospital telling them that the Hill girl died. The boy took a carving knife to cut out his own heart. I was here. I'’ll never forget it. Mama... Tried to stop him from killing himself. And that'’s when it happened. It was like the devil took him. It was... It was no 14-year-old boy! It wasn'’t Alex. The man has searched all his life to find someone to love again. And now that he'’s found her, and even ready to propose... Can'’t you just leave them in peace! Where are they? The church? Are they at the church? Yes. [SOBS] [ENGINE STARTS] [TIRES SCREECH] [DIALING PHONE]Come on, Beth. Come on. Work. Piece of shit. [LOCKS DOOR] MONIKA: Why did you want to meet me here, Alex? I'’ve often thought about you on your wedding day. So few women deserve to wear white. That'’s why I chose you. Chose me? Yes. Because you have the most perfect faith of all I have known. Frankovich. Frankovich, it'’s Hunt. He'’s after Monika. Henry, Beth'’s been trying to reach you. Yeah, I know. My cell'’s out. Henry, Shannon'’s just gone into surgery. Whew. [RADIO] Smith, where are you? Henry, do you copy? Henry, forget Hunt and send someone else. [MAN SPEAKING LATIN] No, Frankovich. It has to be me. Why you, Henry? '’Cause I'm the token atheist. Henry, you got to get to the...[PEALS OUT] Henry! It takes a perfect person to hold on to their faith. Nobody'’s perfect, Alex. There'’s something I want to share with you. With all this death and destruction, how do I explain this? Uh... Anyone can kill for a reason. They can kill out of righteousness, anger, They can kill for money, race... Even pleasure. Do you know something? I know he takes no pleasure in what he does, that he knows it'’s wrong, gains nothing by his actions, Yet... Stands to lose everything. Then why does he do it? Because he can. He chooses to kill. Sometimes in the most brutal, senseless way possible. Monika, God kills for that motive. Now, I am willing to sacrifice everything to match God'’s indifference.[GASPS] [COUGHING]Aah! The House of God is closed, Priest. Your faith is impotent. Now... Let us bring the lamb to the slaughter. VALERIE: Alex! Why, Alex? You'’re not a killer. Of course not. What'’s a bit of murder between friends, huh? What about everything you'’ve worked for? Doesn'’t that mean anything to you? Now, doesn'’t that sound just so pure? VALERIE: Alex! Help me! Nobody deserves to die. Nobody. But they do, don'’t they? VALERIE: Please don'’t leave me. Are you talking about Valerie? Love never dies, Alex. She'’s waiting for you in the Kingdom of Heaven. [INHALES SHARPLY] I killed my mother. The Kingdom of Heaven'’s never gonna be open for me. Yes, it would through forgiveness. God forgives all. I'’ve spent a lifetime looking for forgiveness. I can'’t forgive me. And I won'’t forgive God. I forgive you. I have a test for you. Try this. Your life for Father Samuels, huh? Ohh! Which is it gonna be? Don'’t do this. Who lives, Monika? You or the priest? [DOOR OPENS] [GASPS] Everybody is surprising me today. Let her go. You did get the news, didn'’t you? Yeah. I came here. Well, a less charitable soul would say that you don'’t love your daughter. Me, I just think you'’re a coward, Smith. This sort of thing'’s easier for you to show up for. There'’s a third choice. Even you can'’t escape death, Hunt. Yes, but I can challenge God for the soul of one of his faithful. Then what? Well, I'’ll be the first person in history to beat God, to take something instead of the reverse. Now that'’s something. That'’s insane. Maybe you should call my hospital, see how Shannon'’s doing. If you hurt my little girl... All I did was pay for the operation, Smith. The rest was up to God. It was so sad. She was so young. That is a lie. Life is cruel, Smith. How could God let something like that happen? He didn'’t. I did it! Blame me. After all, you don'’t really believe in anything, do you? If you kill her, whose will is it? You'’re a believer? [UNCOCKS GUN] I'’m not perfect, Alex. I don'’t have perfect faith. And I don'’t want to die. [PUTS GUN DOWN] Well, then... I choose him of faith. Ohh. [GROANING] [COUGHS] VALERIE: Alex. Alex. Uhh. [DOOR OPENS] [GASPS] [DOOR CLOSES] [CHILDREN SINGING] Valerie. Hunt! [TIRES SCREECH] VALERIE: Please don'’t leave me. I'’ve felt a million things. And I feel... [EXHALES] Nothing. [BIRDS WINGS FLAPPING] BOY: Wait for me, Valerie. I'’m coming. [BELL TOLLING] HENRY: What are you doing, sweetheart? Playing with a spider. Yeah. Don'’t hurt him. Why don'’t we let him live, okay? I'’ve got something for you. What is it? Close your eyes. Hold out your hands. Open your eyes. Every time you press one of these, you can talk to an angel. Like emails to Heaven? Yeah, something like that. [FAINT WHISPERS] [POUNDING]
