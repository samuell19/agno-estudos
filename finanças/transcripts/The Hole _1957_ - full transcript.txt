ICHIKAWA Kon August 24 Savings Accounts Sect. I'll be leaving now, Sir. My eyes are bleary. I must be tired. Not that young anymore... Manager. Still, I love hunting, stalking game all day. My body is still quite vigorous. MUTSUI... why didn't you do it, man? No large sums go in or out after the 25th, right? I told you before this coward wouldn't do it. You should have believed me. We're managers and managers can't get away with bank theft. Everything must carry on as usual. We need the help of the clerk in charge of systems. Hey, MUTSUI... today we paid out 10 million Yen to Takahashi Industries. If you had handled that transaction, a third of that... 333,333 Yen would have been yours. That's right. Only... I was too frightened. The 3 of us analyzed thoroughly how we'd do it. Just do what we agreed. It's too late to leave the team. Don't kill... don't kill me! Calm down, calm down MUTSUI. People like us would never murder someone. There'll be another chance. There it is. Good isn't it. - So that's it. "Exposing Police Corruption," it says. Did such a thing really happen? Police inspector "S" could even be me. I'm Inspector SARUMARU. My initial is "S". That's it, they mean me! Bungei Kouron's a first rate magazine. - So that makes it true? I'm under the city boss's thumb? Not you. This inspector "S". "S" is the initial for SARUMARU. So it must mean me. Don't you see that? They must have had inside information. Otherwise how could they know such details. I'll sue Bungei Kouron for slander. No one's to read this. POLICE CORRUPTION "Chief Insp. "S" Under City Boss's Thumb" What's he going to do? Good morning. - Ya! BUNGEI KOURON Go away. Don't disturb us. BUNGEI KOURON EDITOR Murder! You're... a murderer! Is that so urgent? What to do now? Enough Mr. OEDA. Thanks for your help. The instant of shooting and being shot... I think I get it now. It's like... feeling the existential weight of the gun. Just don't be late for your deadline. Who is this man? - A novelist we're promoting. He's young and inexperienced... that's why I had to act out the murder with him. Anyway, who are you? - Me? I am... - I don't think we've met before. I'm very busy so please leave now. So the Chief Editor of Bungei Kouron is you! What is this? The terrible corruption of Officer "G". (reads headline) Likely from this month's edition. - That's right! So you must be a policeman? Chief Inspector "S" refers to me? SARUMARU starts with "S", right? So you are Chief Inspector Sarumaru. Excuse me! Please have a seat. Card, card, card... This is my card. Pleased to meet you. So... please... These days, the world seems upside-down. We really appreciate your hard work. I too... am very busy... so I haven't had much time to read. Excuse me a second. Chief Inspector "S"... like a Sengoku era warrior, he had black eye brows thick like a broom... and an out-of-fashion moustache... his body fit and well built... taken all together, it could be no one except a policeman. The typical classic policeman type... I see. No mistake. It must mean you. Has to be. This article is a smash hit. Thanks to you sales doubled. I'll sue for defamation. I guessed someone would come to shout about it like this. We already felt responsible. We fired the reporter yesterday. Fired? Yes, a first-class journalist. I'll sue him. - Her. A woman? - KITA Nagako. KITA Nagako? "Kita" as in "north". "Nagako" as in "long life". What's KITA Nagako's address? - That's the problem. The psychology of the public is very curious. Even if you win the case... you'll never lose the stigma of being corrupt. I'm not a corrupt policeman! Stay calm. What we're talking about here is public opinion. Is there no way out? Just one. - What's that? You're also a human being. We must show you as one. You must write declaring your innocence. If they feel your sincerity, they'll accept you warmly. Then... they'll apologize. - I'm no writer. I'm glad to help you. I'll publish it next month. I won't do it! I'm innocent. Public opinion can eat shit ! You mustn't use such words. With the public... foul words are taboo. If you do, you'll be a social outcast. - LAST WILL & TESTAMENT - 1 2 3 4 ( across the top right to left ) Good afternoon. Working? Oh, the will again? When you die give me this apartment. My rooms get too much sun in the evening. This time it's my final will. Are you really going to die? Wipe your tears. This world is full of injustice. Police are supposed to ensure justice. But for money, they don't. The magazine made a fortune from my article and then fired me. Today, for money, people would even kill their parents. I tried to fight with my pen but now I give up. Don't be so pessimistic. The public supports you. Your so-called public is nowhere. Every individual is unique, soul and body. It's rude to lump them into a uniform bunch. Greedy bosses make profits... by casually creating a bogeyman... the 'public'. Hey... you hungry? I'm too upset to eat today. Hunger will only make you more upset. Don't be silly. Take this. But I didn't write lies. The info was from TORIGAI, a cop in Jijo... whose only good point is he's honest. So. If they fire me, they should fire him too. That fool... I'll get him fired. - Don't do it. Pity him. I got fired. Can't you understand? Unlike you. I don't have savings. - Have some more. I probably won't find a new job. You can write, no? Take anything and write whatever people crave. There's no point in writing. In a small country like Japan where the police are powerful... we think it's impossible for someone to completely disappear. But every year more than 30 missing people go unfound. Where do they hide? - That's just it! The story of their days hiding is very thrilling. People will eat it up. How do I research that? Just do it, go missing. Then write about it. If I do it, they'll soon find me. - Because your pretty, right? They call you a top journalist because of your good looks. But it's a relative question. I was once on a magazine cover. Yes, a beautiful cover. Thanks to a clever photographer. Reportage on 'missing persons' cases... It won't be exciting if it's too short. Will you lend me money while I'm hiding? Find a sponsor to cover it, why not? If you plan it well any company will jump at it. Don't forget this was my idea, eh? If you use my idea, you have to pay me 20%. Absolutely! How lucky I am! A first class journalist like Ms. KITA has come to us... with such a wonderful idea. Since its founding... our company has grown a lot. Soon we plan to be the king of weeklies. There are so many weeklies, but not one as famous as us. Nippon Weekly! It's the most famous, no? How much is the manuscript fee? It's a great idea, but a simple documentary... won't be that exciting. I'm sure I can make it exciting. - Of course, your writing style is. Does Nippon Weekly think KITA Nagako's a good bet? Excuse me, who are you? I'm KITA Nagako's current agent. I find contacts for authors. I sometimes find scripts for drama groups. I also scout for film companies. I introduce workers to grand houses. I'm AKABANE Suga. So you do whatever's needed. So Ms. AKABANE... what's the bet then? First... the period... one whole month. Can KITA Nagako disappear for a whole month? You offer a reward to anyone who can find Ms. KITA in time. If nobody can, she gets the reward. Simultaneously release the news in Weekly Nippon. Interesting. A million Yen reward. A million? - A million! No, 800,000... 500,000 is enough. We'll show a large photo of Ms. KITA. Find her in time... get 300,000! 500,000, wasn't it? - A reward of 500,000 it is. Definitely! 8 million live in Tokyo alone, if 1 in 4 grab a Nippon Weekly, 30 Yen by 2 million: 60 million! We'll release it tomorrow at noon. One sec... a photo. In any case we only have two employees. I'm the boss, editor, cameraman and employee. Right, thank you so much. I have to go to the printer's and change the plate. So, that's it. Can I get an advance to cover travel expenses? As a new company we don't have much cash on hand. I'll pay after 1 month, if you succeed that is. The bet starts with tomorrow's issue. Don't forget. So you'll lend me the money. I'll ask someone I know at my bank. DAIOKU BANK I'm here to see Mr. SHIRASU. I phoned ahead, KITA Nagako. Just a minute, please. Just a minute, please. I'll call the manager. Please. Please have a seat. This must seem oddly sudden. Yes. Ms. AKABANE called me about your matter. You're planning a rather strange project. - Yes. I must hide for one month. Is a whole month really possible? Is it possible to disappear completely like that? I plan to do it alone. I won't hide with friends or get help from relatives. Friends and relatives won't believe my prize is 500,000 Yen. Respectfully... I'm certain nobody will realize where I am. Of course I'll be disguised. - How so? I can't say. If I did you'd find me. Ah, I guess you're right. So then... afterward, you plan to write about your experience. From another perspective... society should find this test interesting. Okay... that's fine. I'll be glad to help you. Thanks a lot. As a bank, we don't lend to those who aren't our clients... officially speaking. But I've known... Ms. AKABANE for a long time. So I'll advance you the funds. So then, just a minute please. So... please... 50,000 Yen. I didn't ask for that much. The loan was for 30,000, wasn't it? Japan is small, but has lots of obscure corners. Rail tickets will add up, no? If I win 500,000 I'll immediately return your money. Ya! I'll take it. A receipt is required. Please sign this. Ms. KITA Nagako. A very impressive name. Thank you very much. I pray for your success. - Right. I want to take so many things. Too much luggage will attract unwanted attention. Tomorrow we start. The phone bill's still not paid. Due on the 25th... but that's today. What a pain. Okay, I'll pay it first thing. Yes. KITA here. What? You're a bit hard to hear. Chikubou Publishing? A collection of women writer's works? You want to include my work? That's wonderful. I really apprec... What? Photo... of me? For the front page? Hayata Studio... in Ginza. Ah... take the photo there? Thank you so much for everything. I look forward to it. Thank you, thank you! Good. It's our pleasure. Easily fooled. One meeting told me she's a simple woman. Hey you! Pick-up the photo prints. Do yourself up like her. Go to the bank. Start work under MUTSUI. I'll set it up. I see the likeness. - Me too. When I saw KITA, I instantly thought of her. And I got this idea. It's dangerous risking it all... on an unknown bar girl. How dare you say anything about me? MUTSUI man... this is a one in a million chance. KITA Nagako comes back next month on the 25th. That day a large sum pays out. To sum it up... tomorrow this Ms. KITA starts at Daioku Bank. She will steal the money. The other, returns all innocent, and gets caught. If she says she wasn't in the bank, then where was she? Nobody will believe her. So two Ms. KITAs appear as one. - Right. When the real KITA Nagako returns, our NAKAMURA Takeko disappears. One month in an office is boring. I want more money. A 4 way split. All equal. What's your problem? Where will she stay? - What, I have to move? Of course. - Why not KITA's apartment? That won't work. KITA Nagako has to be missing. KITA Nagako has to stay in hiding, no? Wait, wait. I'm confused. This woman can't stay there then. - Why? She's not the real KITA. - She's a complete fake. We need one more hiding place. Really? We do? - Am I wrong? You're right. - Odd, eh? Hey... this is Mr. SHIRASU's room, no? Your room is luxurious and you earn well. Why this crazy plan to steal money? Without parents, friends or lover you can't understand. Next year they retire me. I slaved for my family. I only made director by chance. As a man I want once to be boss. I'll buy all Fuji TV stocks at the fall share meeting. You don't know the salaryman's life. If I had money, I'd quit tomorrow. My dodgy heart makes bank work hard. They push me so hard I could die any day. This photo is for my first book. Make it beautiful,okay? Like you would for an actress. Take lots and lots then choose the best for printing. Chikubou Publishing will pay. You can take a deluxe photo. Should I smile? If I smile my mouth twists. Better I don't smile. Better you don't speak. Officer TORIGAI... good timing. I need to talk to you. Not 'Officer" anymore. Your article angered Inspector SARUMARU. So he fired me. - Ah, really? Are you a demon? Your article got me fired. "Ah really," you say, smiling heartlessly. You're wrong. I got fired too. - You too? Is that so? - I'm sorry. What I did hurt you. - I'm sorry. I went too far. I'm opening a detective agency in Chiba. Please visit me in Inawa. You going on a trip? - Yes, sort of. Then. Good bye. - Good bye. FIND AND WIN 500,000 YEN ! FIND MS. KITA NAGAKO 29th DAY Please buy this. Musty... Anyway, I couldn't leave the windows open. Tomorrow 500,000 Yen will finally be mine. "Marutoku Monthly Payment Plan" What's this? The radio you purchased... 2nd installment not yet received. We went to Daioku Bank where you work. Due to your absence we're sending this notice. I didn't buy any radio. Me working at Daioku Bank. It's total nonsense. Daito Ward, Benten St. Gokuraku Aprt. What??? Exactly the same name. INTERVIEW ROOM Excuse me. Who are you? KITA Nagako! Ms, that is. Due to your fine disguise... I didn't recognize you. I'm finally back. You returned a day early, didn't you?. You remembered that detail very well. Ah... due to the nature of my work I habitually remember dates. Actually you're still hiding, aren't you? 24 hours more, no? But it's cool and a bit cheeky... staying the last night at home. Also... this letter was in my apartment. Someone with the same name working here, right? Too strange a coincidence, so I came to see you. My curiosity is stronger than most people's. You're not trying to cheat me of 500,000 Yen are you? If I don't get 500,000 Yen... I can't repay my loan, can I? As for me, I'm fine. We have so many employees, I can't remember them all. One minute... I'll just check. Branch Manager. Ah, you have a guest. Ms. KITA Nagako! You bank workers have good memories, no? I only came here once before, right? I saw your photo in Weekly Japan. This man is very discrete. He'll stay quiet for a customer. Really? Oh, I'm glad. - What was it? The Central Bank just called about the draft. Right. It's big trouble if I'm recognized. Big trouble. My photo!! "HAYATA STUDIO" Sorry to keep you. There is another KITA Nagako here. She recently joined us. So I hadn't noticed yet. What's she like? I'd like to meet her. Unfortunately she's not here today. After your hiding is over I'll introduce you. I apologize for that. - It's nothing. So... how was it? You must have had interesting times on your travels. Not one person recognized you? - Not a soul. There's still a risk. Maybe only you think that's true. It is. Surprisingly I'm good at disguise. Oh, that's wonderful. Today however you should stay out of sight. Yes. The contest is on until noon tomorrow. I'll hide and not move. - Leave by the back door. To be safe no one should see you, even for a second. She returned a day early. That firm receives the funds later today? Takamori Construction. I already called them. It's rather a good price. Isn't it 25,000,000 for them? Are you okay with that? - It's fine. That woman came back to Tokyo today. Nobody knows that. Do you remember who picked up the KITA Nagako photo? Well... and who are you? Can I use your phone a sec? Hello... is that Chikubou Publishing? I heard you will publish a collection of women's works. What? There’s no such project? So you wouldn't have asked for authors' photos? Please excuse me. What? Who am I? I'm an advertiser. "HEAVENLY APART__TS" She took the room but I never once saw her. Why rent to someone unseen? Alleged brother came. How'd he look? - Can't recall. The rent? - You ask too much. Who are you? - A private eye. Obviously an irresponsible woman. Surely not worth marrying. 1. A bill for monthly payment on a radio. 2. My photo in the bank manager's office. 3. Had me take my photo for what is clearly a bogus publication. 4. A fictitious renter with my name at "Heavenly Apartments". 5. Bank manager asked me for details of my secret travels. Of course a hole! "Sotoji MUTSUI" Got you. Hello. Are you Mr. MUTSUI from the Daioku Bank? That's right. There's a reason I can't tell you my name. Actually I wanted to ask you about Ms. KITA who works at your bank. I saw your name plate at the teller's window. Are you Ms. KITA Nagako? There's something I should tell you. Please come quickly. Right away. Excuse me... Excuse me! Good evening. You... who are you? You killed him! I just got here myself. Move and I'll shoot. Sit yourself down. Is that the police? My brother's been killed. House 5, Iwaji. MUTSUI Sotoji. I'm his sister, Kikuko. It just happened... 30 minutes ago. I work at a Jazz Cafe... "Presly". A caller said my brother was dying. I rushed home. He'd been murdered. The killer is still here. I'm looking at her. Come right away. Hurry! Thief! Catch him, please! This man just stole my handbag. This one, right? I wasn't thinking. Thank you. - Just a minute. You must come to the station. It's definitely my bag. There's a wallet, notes, watch, etc. It's protocol. I'll need your name. I'm in a hurry to meet my friend. Is there an incident? Oh! Please wait! This is your handbag isn't it? You'll need your money! For good reason, I spent a month traveling. Returning today... I found someone using my name working at the Daioku Bank. I only went there once to borrow money last month. At the bank I met a Mr. SHIRASU. A KITA Nagako works there, though absent today. All rather vague. I also noticed my photo hidden in Mr. SHIRASU's files. I was told it was ordered by a publisher. When I went to get it, it had already been picked up. I called the publisher. They said they hadn't ordered it. I went to this KITA's apartment. They said she had never shown up. There's something odd at that bank. SHIRASU's suspicious, no? - It's a good bet. Who was that KITA Nagako? I phoned Mr. MUTSUI. At the bank I had seen Mr. MUTSUI, the cash teller. and a dapper man whose name I didn't get. MUTSUI said, "We must speak." When I got there, he was already dead. It's clearly murder. The motive's money. - Money? If something’s odd at a bank, it's always money. Well... I appreciate this. You traveled far from Tokyo to give me the case. I felt in my pocket and your note was there. A rural agency doesn't get good cases. My family say try the army or farming. They're no help. I'm intelligent. In future I'll set up in Tokyo. What is it you want investigated? By noon tomorrow we must prove SHIRASU is guilty. Why come to me for such a simple case? Can't the police handle it? The police believe I'm the guilty party. - You?! But that's stupid. There's no motive or evidence. Why not tell the police... just that. There's a reason I can't be seen before noon tomorrow. What reason's that? I came here because you wouldn't know why. I can't say. - Then I refuse the case. I can't think what's more important than clearing yourself of murder. You're an expert at causing trouble. Last time I helped you I got fired. Not again. Even for 20% of 500,000... 100,000 Yen? 100,000! That's enough to start an agency in Tokyo, no? Probably. - Do you really have it... so much? I'm penniless now. I barely paid for the train. Sorry, lend me 1,000 Yen. - Same old bullshit. I'm sick of it! Then I won't hire you. Who is KITA Nagako? Why did SHIRASU kill MUTSUI? I'll find out. 1,000 Yen, that village robe... and your watch. Somehow I must borrow them. - Bossy and selfish as always! 25,000,000 STOLEN JOURNALIST KITA NAGAKO CHARGED TELLER KILLED - CULPRIT ESCAPES DAIOKU BANK CASE SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR'S OFFICE What'll we do... if it comes out in the newspaper? I told you only publish a rough outline of the case. But KITA Nagako has to be the murderer, right? If Bungei Kouron and the early paper run it, people will know. Don't open up to magazine and newspaper reporters! You're too easy going! There's no doubt KITA Nagako is the culprit. The murder happened at 7 pm yesterday. Takemori Construction's payroll was 25,206,883 Yen. At 11pm we heard the bank notes were just newsprint cut like 1,000 Yen notes. The bank's Shibuya branch withdrew the money. These 2 facts must be a connected. A clerk at the Daioku Bank was murdered. As expected... this KITA Nagako woman turns up. I wish I had never heard the name KITA Nagako. I may run all over Japan but I'll bloody catch her! In an investigation don't be biased. It's not bias... I'm certain! Forensics found prints on the knife that stabbed MUTSUI. They matched prints in KITA's room. What about Japan Weekly? According to the editor, she had to stay hidden for a month. She couldn't possibly hide working in a bank. She faked hiding in Japan and hid in the bank. Preparing her crime while there. But hiding in a bank, wouldn't you use an alias. If it were me, of course. This is the simian cunning of a woman. She left the knife in the can by the door. Again simian cunning. MUTSUI was her accomplice in the theft. To grab it all herself, she killed him. Takemori's accountant who went to the bank, said he surely received the cash. Around 11 when he went to move the cash to the payroll bag, he got a big surprise! This is my deduction. The criminal counted the cash... in front of the Takemori accountant, and put it in the canvas bag. Then while saying something, he slid the bag under the desk. A second canvas bag was already under the desk. Acting quickly... he passed the one... full of fake money. The criminal said... thanks for your business, or something like that. I can see it. You describe it so clearly. No... it's just logical deduction. 25 million fills a big bag. Well... it's quite a lot. How did the criminal carry it out of the bank? Haven't figured that out yet. I brought her. - Huh? Well... - Come, sit down please. After a long night in jail, you must be angry. But you know, I don't think you're involved in this. However, sadly your brother definitely was; making you an important witness. Please cooperate with us going forward. Regulations say you get breakfast. You can go after eating. I know you from somewhere. One of the clients at work reads a lot. He's got the hots for me. The book he read to me... must have been about you. It mentioned an inspector "S". You read it? What was written was wicked. Don't give her any food! Get out of here now. Where exactly are you going? Go straight. Since getting in... you just say "straight, straight." What's up with you? He's been cheating on me. He being your significant other? - Yes. I wrote so many letters, but he stopped replying. I had to come all the way from my village. He's living with a beautiful woman. Damn him! I feel bad. It's too common. So did you break it off? I haven't seen him since he came here to work. That won't do. In this case you have to meet, and listen to his story. Find out what's really happening... and give his face a good slap. Know where he works? I know. It's a bank. Why not catch him as he enters the bank? If he sees my face he'll run away. I can see that could happen. Alright! When you see him, tell me. I'll get out, con him and get him into the car. I can't ask that of a total stranger. - No problem. Which bank is it? Daioku Bank, Shibuya branch. - Daioku Bank, Shibuya. Isn't that... where the robbery happened? But... no... You're not the one robbed it, eh? Look! That's the guy. That guy? A fine looking man. I get it... perfect for fooling women. Hurry up! You're mistaken! Let me out! Stop! I'll call the police. It's me! You forgot me? I'm sorry but... You...? - Don't say you don't remember me. Caught me eh? So then... let's us talk calmly. Somewhere alone... would be better. What's your game? What do you want from me? You're in great danger now. A man who knew what you know was killed for it last night. What's this about? I'm KITA Nagako who borrowed from the bank. Not the KITA Nagako working there. Who knew? You and murdered MUTSUI, no? The manager also knew. - Of course, he's the criminal. How did you get such a crazy idea? SHIRASU knew I was hiding for a month. So he plans to drop me in the hole. He hires a look-a-like at the bank. She steals the money. SHIRASU plays it cool. And the police chase me. Hard to believe, no? Such a story. Believe it or not, they'll still kill you, no? After Mr. MUTSUI was killed, you're the only witness left who can prove my innocence. But... if I say your KITA Nagako isn't the criminal. Will anyone believe me? There's no evidence. Evidence? Even if I admit to seeing you there before yesterday's bank job... the only one who can confirm it is the bank manager. If, the manager is the criminal... he'd just say I lied about you being there. Who's to say we aren't accomplices. That's right. Can anyone verify your movements while hiding? Anyone at all? I was too careful for that. So then... the only way left is to find the fake KITA Nagako. Of course! Wherever she's hiding she has to contact SHIRASU. Can't you listen into SHIRASU's calls at the bank. I'm sure I can. Please listen carefully. Remember he stole my knife and killed MUTSUI, no? I'll be careful. Only... why are you so worried about me? If you get killed... Again they'll use fake evidence and blame me. I don't want to fall deeper in the hole. How about... we meet here this evening. Alright then. We'll share information. 8 o'clock okay? - I'll manage. Three more minutes. Even if the KITA woman comes in... keep working as usual. You are safe with us here. - You're sure she'll come? The police have done all they possibly can. She's here. Hello... I brought the returns. Good bye. More returns! I thought this was a perfect project. Why aren't they selling? Half a million Yen prize. Women are greedy. She's bound to come. Hey. It's KITA Nagako! Answer it. I don't think it's her. It's her. I'm AMAKASU. Congratulations. As promised your prize money's ready. Please pick it up. Police? There are no police. I promise. Myself... I never believed you did such a terrible thing. What, something wrong? Where are you now? Stations, hotels, ryokan and free dorms. Police will watch anywhere a criminal might go. KITA Nagako is a rat in a barrel. In the meantime we keep your room available. If forced from the barrel, the rat will jump here. If KITA Nagako comes, say you believe her and she can stay here. Then call us right away. You understand, right? - Yes. Yes... it is. What... is that you? I was to get 20% of the prize for next month's expenses. You lied! Lend you money? No way in hell! Writing your will you wanted to die. It was I gave you the idea. You always planned to rob the bank, no? It's her! All along you've been playing me. Don't call me again! The banking business is tough, no? Even after the big incident it was business as usual wasn't it? Yes. Our most important asset is public trust. You seem to be very tired. - Yes. Head office called me to an urgent meeting this morning. The bank must do strict background checks on new employees, right? MUTSUI worked in this branch for 6 years. We skipped the checks because he recommended her. At the time I was very busy. So MUTSUI targeted your busiest time. Today... I handed in my resignation. Resigned... you? Liability for my junior's error... must fall on me. My... you're a very admirable man. I wish politicians had a conscience like you. The criminal will be arrested soon. CHIGI pal..! Did you forget me? It's TORIGAI Akita. This is a rare visit. Excuse me. I'm glad you came in. But I'm a little busy today. I understand. I saw the newspaper. When I found out you were here I decided to come in. What is it? Why me? - Nothing special. I haven't seen you in 10 years, so I decided to drop by. What... are you doing now? - Looking for an office. PI. - Private investigator? No, no. Nothing too big. What about... this evening, coming to mine for a drink? Right... I want to ask... so many things. That is... we've a lot of catching up to do. Oh! See you later. Bastard... he must hang out here. Who is he? - TORIGAI. I can't stand the sight of him! You don't have to look, just grab him. KITA Nagako. Hello, you! What is it, uncle? Visit me, no? "Arusaro" Behind Shibuya Theatre When the one we spoke of calls, shall I say what we discussed? Yes. I'll go and finish up quickly. I was surprised that she was so clever. Mr. CHIGI... phone. Yes. This is CHIGI. Oh... I'm sorry about this morning. Yes. They contacted me. The manager said he'll be there at two. Kawasaki City. The coast road, K-Construction, right? Eh? What? Ahhh... so that's my double's hideout, no? That's quite far. I'll go right away. No problem. Yes. Hello... Is this the Daioku Bank? This is Takemori Construction. Just a minute please. I'll put you through. Hello. Branch Manager please. Is Manager SHIRASU there please. Secretarial office. Our Account Dept. manager wants to see you at 2:30. How is your schedule? Ah... he just went into a meeting. It can't be helped. So... I'll be waiting. What a pain. I can't go right now. Mr. SHIRASU? - Yes? KITA Nagako. Right. The real one. Why did you come? Not so similar. - With make-up I'm similar. Everyone thought I was you. I was always saying they had the wrong person. At least you could've paid your radio payment. Do you have 2,500 Yen? - I don't know about that. Why hide in a place like this? Admit you faked being me. It'll show I'm innocent. SHIRASU's guilt will be clear. Soon SHIRASU will kill you. Let's go to the police. You won't get charged. Nobody's going to kill me. So long as I have "that". - What is "that"? The one killed will be you. If you die, the case will never be solved! Ouch, it hurts. Ouch, ouch. Three o'clock. SHIRASU will only stay until 2:30. The taxi here takes 40 minutes. I'm finished if he finds me here. Finally. Fire! SHIRASU has come. It'll blow up. Hurry! She sure has a nerve. She even stole my things. Thank goodness. Even our feet are the same size. This is what she meant by "that". So, if you have this, your life will be fine. It's 1 of 3 parts. Must mean there are 3 criminals. MUTSUI must have been in on it? Ah... Swiss melon grows... In the shining... meadow. Oh... Blew me so kind. Oh... I was alone. Now kind wind blow, Bring me a lover. Bring... Last night someone called saying your brother was dying. Who was it? - I don't know. The voice on the phone wasn't clear. Please leave. I'll get in trouble if I'm not working. I will catch the awful man who killed your brother. I'm trying to get revenge for you. Hey, uncle... you're being too rough. What's it to you? Yah... We met once at the "Literature Review". Aren't you a novelist? It wasn't for me. I found novel writing boring. I sing now. Oh... the wind is so kind. Well... I was alone. Now... kind wind blow... Bring me a lover. It is so splendid. I... dream of surrender. Well... My heart is red and blue. Apologies. - Excuse me. Excuse me. Sit beside me. You'd better do it. Goodness... it's you! - You have your pistol? Oh that? Actually it's a lighter. It looks a bit real, no? Who was it called about your brother last night? Just now a policeman asked me that. - The detective was here?! I said I don't know and I don't! Did your brother give you anything? Stingy guy never gave me anything. Except this pendant. This one... just yesterday he gave me this. Oh no! Who put this bit of paper here? Mu 83 After 30 days becomes state It was just a pipe, no? - Now we're even. Mr. CHIGI? You're okay then? If you hadn't turned up... I'd have gone to the police. I'm just fine. - Didn't you see the evening paper? MYSTERY OF YOUNG FEMALE BODY IN KAWASAKI WAREHOUSE It's the fake me, isn't it? The electric shock killed her? But I pulled the wire out. Oh god, now I'm scared. Was the branch manager there? That’s right. He was there. I saw him. So he must have killed her. - Is that so? I really can't believe that. The branch manager's a murderer. Really? Here... Look at these. They're part of a Tokyo luggage ticket, I think. That woman had 1 piece, the other was in MUTSUI's sister's pendant. So MUTSUI had to be an accomplice. Pieces of a luggage ticket... They tore it in 3 pieces, one each. I'm surprised how smart you are. SHIRASU killed both his partners. But he can't get the money if I hold these. If SHIRASU finds out, he'll kill you. So I should take the money to the police. But how can you get it with only 2 parts. I think I can figure it out. But today I'm so tired I feel faint. Tonight... where will you stay? Are you staying with friends? I don't have any friends. Everything works against me. There's TORIGAI in Chiba whom I can trust a little. Only he's a useless dimwit. Hey... Why not come to my place? There's no one in the apartment. That's not necessary. Oh... There's only one place where I can sleep safely. Where's that? I can't say because I don't want to trouble you. You're the only one to encourage me. Only you Mr. CHIGI. Hey... (poss other language.) (Possibly other language) I'm begging you! What the hell is this? Maybe mixed. They found her behind Sinjuku Station. They always arrest people there. Is she 'cracked'? Hoy! Hey you..! Hey you! What a pain! Please sleep quietly. Okay? I'll let you go in the morning. Listen. 50 Yen if you take this to the luggage check. Alright. Hey... kid. My train is in 5 minutes. I lost my luggage ticket. When did you leave it? - 3 days ago. Could I go in to find it? Customers aren't allowed inside. What is it? - An ordinary bag. It'd be quicker if I go myself. I only have 4 minutes left. Say... brother... please. If the boss finds out, I'm in big trouble. Okay then. Just for you. Did you find it? - Not yet. I found it! There should be 15 books inside. So there are. But I can't release it without some identification. Ah. I found my ticket... but it's torn. Must've thrown out the other part. Is this number enough? No doubt there. It would've been easier if you'd given me this first Excuse me, could you fetch this. It's my husband's case. - Yes. Right away. Your husband's case is quite heavy, eh. Ms. KITA. The police have us under 24 hour surveillance. My employee and the police... just went out for lunch. That's why I came in. I never dreamed you were the culprit. But... the company's in the red. Add a murder case, and it's t-t-too much trouble. This is absolute proof of my innocence. There it is. There's 25 million in here. 25 million... stolen money, no. Why didn't you... take it straight to the police! If I'm not the culprit, you owe me 500,000. So I wanted to show you the proof first. Just newspaper. Please don't cry. Did you make a mistake? I never make mistakes. This is no mistake. But then all this...? Ms. KITA... I understand how you must feel. But the police will be back soon. Please leave. What's this then... this hole? Someone cut out an article, no? Every page has the same hole. They must all be the same article. Same article means...? Daily item, serial story, ser... Show me your newspaper. That's it. This one. Tokyo stock market...? It's all about money. Numbers. Day after day someone cut out the market share prices. Mr. AMAKASU...! Finally I can see the culprit's tracks. It was his hand that cut these out. I just have to find that hand Ms. KITA... Ms. KITA... all these papers... what should I do? Yesterday KITA Nagako called to ask for your room keys. What for? She may have some suspicion. Her voice was very confident. There's not a single clue there. But we can't let that woman interfere. Let her go there. I'll do something. The money at the station... can stay there. It's safe. To move it now would be dangerous. It wasn't noticed. I said it was a suit for repair. I carried it out of the bank with the money in it. Of course the police didn't notice. With only our parts of the ticket we can't take the money out. I didn't find one on the woman I killed. Maybe KITA Nagako took it. Maybe MUTSUI's piece too. Did she say so? - Not at all. KITA Nagako... thinks I'm her only ally. I'll find it soon enough. - You don't sound very worried. There's no time to waste. She must have it. We must get it back tonight for sure. Good. Nobody saw you. You're doing well for yourself. It's even cleaner than my room. It's all like a dream. I don't want to do a thing. Just quietly relax like this. I don't want to think at all. That's right. You don't have to do a thing. If you lay low here... soon the police will catch the real criminal. How ever cunning he may be... the culprit will soon show his tail, no? That's right. I've already seen something like a tail. Myself... I don't know much about women. But... there aren't many women as bold and daring as you. Rather clever... a bit eccentric... very attractive to a simple guy like me. But... wouldn't it be better not to go to SHIRASU's? I'm going! Aren't you afraid? Look... you're shaking. I want this to end today. It's too stressful for me. Me too. Every day when I see SHIRASU... the fear gives me the shakes. I can't take this anymore. That's why I've asked for a week off. - Oh... Are you going somewhere? SHIRASU's place... do you have to go? Yes. SHIRASU will be out tonight. I heard him on the phone... about meeting with our bosses. Mr. CHIGI please... come with me. To SHIRASU's you mean? I want to search as soon as possible... but if I take too long... and SHIRASU comes back, he'll kill me. You can keep watch at the door. If you see SHIRASU coming... knock to warn me and run. Don't worry about me. Somehow I'll get away. What exactly... is it you're looking for? I can't tell. If it goes wrong, you'll become involved, right? So... won't you come? For your sake... I'll... do anything. - Thank you!! Why am I doing such a dangerous thing? CHIGI and SHIRASU... why don't I run away? No. I won't run! If they set a trap for me... I'll set one for them too. Win or lose; I won't know without trying. What a surprise. Did you find something? - Yes. Something critical that proves you're behind the bank heist. That's a very bad joke. But you're not surprised to see me here. Why don't you call the police? Tomorrow, like a man I will take the blame and resign. I see no need to call the police. You're going to kill me with that, no? That's absurd. If I fire this, people will come running. You say a bank robber intruded so you shot. People might accept that. You've got it wrong. I'm not a criminal. Hunting is my hobby. And money too. - Money? Because it's my work, money's of interest. You plan to mask the gun shot with loud jazz no? I like energetic music. Together you, the fake me, and MUTSUI, stole the money. Then you killed MUTSUI and my double to grab it all. You kept the stolen 2,500,000 in a case in the check-in at Tokyo station. This morning I found the case. Inside it was stuffed with old newsprint. What..? Newsprint? You yourself did that. The case was a diversion. The loot went elsewhere? Where did you hide it? - I didn't! I never even touched it. The one who took it was... I knew you'd come back. I couldn't escape. I was so worried. You killed him to save me. So I did. I saw SHIRASU standing over you with the shotgun. Without thinking... - I'm sorry. In the end I've gone and involved you in this case. He died before he told me where the money was. If we find the money... then even the brainless police will know I'm not guilty. You said... there would be evidence in SHIRASU's room. To steal my knife he had to have my spare key. But I didn't find it. You have to escape! You said you took vacation leave. Go right now. Then no one will suspect you. What about you? I give up. I can't get away any more. They already have so much evidence. Also this room is full of my fingerprints. Escape with me. Go as my wife. No one will suspect you. Why do you want me to come with you. Because I love you! We'll go to Hokkaido! We should go quickly. Why not call the airport now? Please connect me to Japan Airlines. Hello... Japan Airlines? Do you have seats to Hokkaido tonight? 11:45? That's fine. I'll take two. The name's UENO. Where did that gun come from? I've had it a long time. Since my army days. Better take it to Hokkaido. Dumped in Tokyo it could lead back to you. We should leave separately. I'll get ready and go. See you in Haneda. By 11:45. Got that? Pretty cold for a supposed lover eh? "23:45 departure to Hokkaido. Booking for 2 passengers. - SHIRASU" Murder! Murder! Out of the way! Any confession yet? Did you catch the murderer? Let me interview him. Move. Move! - We haven't even opened yet! SPECIAL DAIOKU BANK CASE OFFICE Has she come around yet? She hasn't even budged. It's not good. It's too late for the morning edition. Darn. Give her another injection. After so much trouble we caught the culprit. We can't let her die on us now. Where's the luggage check from her pocket. I sent a man with it to Shinjuku station. Good idea. It must be where the money is. That female monkey mind... kept it in her pocket where we'd find it. Who went to the station? Still not back? I'm back Sir! What took you so long? Engine trouble on the way. Is that it? - Here it is! It looks like an ordinary cloth bundle. Hard to believe 25,000,000 Yen's in there. When the reporters see this they won't believe their eyes. Damn it! Haven't they caught the guy at Haneda yet? They just called. They caught him boarding the plane. He'll be here soon. We're lucky we found the memo in Mr. SHIRASU's pocket, saying he was going to Hokkaido with someone on business. Once we question him... we'll know exactly what happened. Why have you dragged me to the police station? Right... don't you work at the bank? - That's right. I'm CHIGI. Yes... Mr. CHIGI I didn't drag you here. I just have a few questions for you. My flight's left now hasn't it. I'm supposed to be on vacation. - Vacation? If you check at the bank you'll see. They granted my leave. Not for a business trip with Mr. SHIRASU? No, just me. Didn't you book 2 seats. You're mistaken. But you paid at check in? I booked by phone. From where? - My apartment. The operator said someone called Haneda from SHIRASU's place. We checked Haneda. The booking was for 2. You boarded with 1 of those tickets. Hey. Pat this man down. Check his briefcase! It was fired recently. - Get it tested. Oh... they caught you too? These guys... think I killed SHIRASU. Mr. CHIGI... if you didn't kill SHIRASU... how do you know he's dead? It's true I shot him with that gun. To save her life. Just ask her! I've never even met this man. She's lying. You were in SHIRASU's room with me. I went to SHIRASU's place. But by myself. I had money troubles and needed a loan. At that time someone came in. They shot and killed SHIRASU and hit me from behind. Right. He must be the shooter. This woman's talking crap. SHIRASU and this woman conspired to rob the bank. The one who killed MUTSUI and the 'Jane Doe' in the Kawasaki "K" factory... was SHIRASU. The "K" factory in Kawasaki? I see! Daioku Bank hold a lien on that factory. Kawasaki police told me that much. I didn't realize it was related to this case. Mr. CHIGI... I guess you know all about it, don't you? I didn't realize the 'Jane Doe' in "K" factory was linked to this case. But that being so, it makes sense, no? Anyway a woman was involved in this case. We thought it was KITA Nagako, but you knew that wasn't right. You killed MUTSUI and the "Jane Doe" woman, no? SHIRASU did that. I would never commit such a foolish murder. But in fact you killed SHIRASU. Dead men tell no tales. I don't think Mr. SHIRASU was involved. Then just ask this woman. She came to my place convinced that SHIRASU was the murderer. I've never been to your room. You often met with me. Do you have a witness who saw us together anywhere? Are you crazy? You were in hiding to win 500,000 Yen. So we thought you were guilty. Why didn't you tell the police that you weren't involved? The bullet we found in SHIRASU'S body... is the same caliber as this gun. Open the suitcase. This is illegal. Without an arrest warrant you can't search my things. It's locked. - Break it. That's 25 million. She did it with me. She's an accomplice. That can't be right. If she was, she'd have up and run to Haneda, and caught the flight with you. You police are considerate. It was good of you to keep this. I'm so relieved your interrogation outfoxed CHIGI. I'll never forget it. It would seem I was mistaken. You are a great cop. - Don't say that. The fact remains I let the culprit escape. Once again I missed my chance. The bank's Mr. CHIGI was the culprit, eh? Oh! That must be where he jumped. Mr. policeman, I finally remembered. Ms. KITA, are you okay. - The bank men. Mr. SHIRASU and CHIGI. - I've just closed the case. How'd that happen? When I got thrown into CHIGI's cupboard. Are you also involved in this case? All night I couldn't sleep. Should I give it to the police... or to you. What is it? - He's just sleepy. Look here. It's full of paper isn't it? But it's important evidence... He's closed the case. Bringing this up will just confuse Det. SARUMARU. Mr. AMAKASU where's her prize? AKABANE... You're a "Nosy Parker", but why come here now? I tried to call SHIRASU but he'd been killed. Who's SHIRASU to you? My banker. I banked with him. So he knew I had stocks in Fuji TV manufacturers. He offered me an above market price. I asked higher, but then he died. What a mistake. I should have sold then. I was in the army with CHIGI. He was always in the stockade. When I saw the news instantly I suspected CHIGI. I wasn't sure where KITA was. So I dared to go to CHIGI's and got this. Why didn't you come here and tell me? Sorry... Ms. KITA didn't know I was in CHIGI's cupboard, she... You're in too much pain. Better not talk. Come. Even if Japan Weekly is in the red, you promised. Readers hardly have time to breathe, let alone search for Ms. KITA. The prize was 500,000, right? These days no one believes in get rich quick schemes. So the article needs to be interesting. By being accused of murder Ms. KITA's story is now way more interesting. Her article will be super popular. You give her the full prize and I'll get the rights to her story. So... the police corruption isn't about Det. SARUMARU, but foreign police. Why didn't you make that clear. I was going to say it was about foreigners. But you said thanks, bye, and took off. - So you shouldn't have been fired. If I had told Det. SARUMARU, it would have created trouble for you. What about my trouble?! Police business is so boring. You're putting me to sleep. Captain... can I go home? Ah... go on, go home. Everyone, go home. I've got a headache. Get out! Captain... just one thing. I still don't understand. If they wanted to steal using my double, why not do it while I was out of Tokyo? That's what you don't understand? The crime is in Tokyo. It's in the newspaper. If you reveal that you are on the Kyushu coast... then everybody knows it wasn't you. That's right... so that's why. Is it true you won 500,000 Yen... Ms. KITA? If you check carefully the prize is subject to 60% tax. What's left is subject to income tax. Hardly 10,000 Yen will remain. All that work for just 10,000 Yen? 10,000's not so bad. It's enough to buy a PI license in Tokyo. It's my money. What I meant to say was borrow. - Understood. You lost your job for helping me, so you feel you're owed the money? Don't be stupid. That happened long ago. I only heard about the prize today. - You sure? When you speak, you only tell your side? I won't borrow it! - I didn't say I wouldn't lend it. You've got great powers of deduction! If you're my assistant, the office will soon be 1st class. My... you mean borrow me too?! - "Borrow" is too cheap, I meant marry. Marriage isn't so bad. So you don't have to pay me. No way! I'm a top rate journalist. I'm the one should get an assistant. Close down in Chiba and become my assistant. How much will you pay me? - If we're married why should I pay you? Forget it! I'll open my office in Tokyo. With whose money? I'll borrow yours.
