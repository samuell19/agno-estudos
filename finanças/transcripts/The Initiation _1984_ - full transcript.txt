Kelly! Mummy! Delta Rho Chi never will die. Delta Rho Chi never will die. Delta Rho Chi... Rise, lowly Pledge. The Sentinel calls. 'Tis the hour of the oath. ...never will die. Delta Rho Chi never will die. Delta Rho Chi never will die. Delta Rho Chi never will die. Delta Rho Chi never will die. Delta Rho Chi never will die. Delta Rho Chi never will die. Delta Rho Chi never will die. Delta Rho Chi never will die. Delta Rho Chi never will die. Delta Rho Chi never will die. Delta Rho Chi never will die. Delta Rho Chi never will die. Delta Rho Chi never will die. Delta Rho Chi... Who knocks? 'Tis I, great Sentinel. Pledge trainer of Delta Rho Chi. Kneel before me and raise your right hands. Pledges Kelly, Beth, Marcia and Alison, do you hereby swear that in this last week of your pledge period you will complete your sacred duties to the best of your ability, that you will obey your older and wiser active sisters, and that you will do anything they ask, no matter what the consequences, so help you God? - I swear. - Then rise, Pledges, and let this night be heralded as the official commencement of your hell week. Here's the schedule, Pledges. Work assignments will be posted Monday. That gives you three more days of freedom. After that, no dates until Initiation, except for the frat party Friday night. A week from Saturday is prank night. Any questions? I'm afraid to ask, but, er... what's up for prank night? And I'm sure our little Cinderellas would like to know, too. Especially you, Kelly. Did Dadums buy you that little number, or did you just pull it off the rack at one of his stores? Come on, Megan, what's the prank? I'm getting to it. You father's building - Fairchild's, that exclusive emporium for the wealthy. You're still in the management trainee programme, aren't you? Yeah. Summers, anyway. - What about it? - You'll have access to the keys. You know the alarm system. If your devoted trainer wanted to get in in the middle of the night? You could arrange it, couldn't you? I don't get your point, Megan. It's very simple, sisters. We send the pledges into Kelly's father's store late Saturday night to steal the nightwatchmafls uniform. - Come on, his uniform? - That's right. From his badge right down to his skivvies. Leave it to Megan the Maniac to dream up some bullshit thing like this. Breaking and entering looks good on a resume. It could be worse. Gwen said last year the pledges had to spend the night in Dean Washburn's bathroom. Wait a second. I heard this nightwatchman guy's a real stud. Hung like a mule or something. Ew, disgusting! Marcia, don't knock it till you've tried it. Look at all these empty beds! Megan's whittling us down to nothing. Fifteen girls we started with, now only four. There's nothing we can do about it. It's the system. I mean, we're pledges and we have to do what we're told to do. Oh, vomit! Maybe if we could find out where Megan's anger came from, we could do something about it. Someone said that she gained twenty pounds last semester. That would do it. No way. Megan's problem isn't cellulite. It's you, Kelly. She's been on your case ever since Andy O'Connell started hounding you like you were a bitch in heat. I only went out with him once. The guy's a creep. Well, creep or not, he's got the scent. - No stopping a jerk-off like that. - Lights out, please. You've got an important week ahead of you. Pleasant dreams. I've got it! Haemorrhoids. Megan is suffering from acute haemorrhoidal discomfort... ...rendering her a royal pain in the ass! Marcia? - I had the dream again. - Really? Makes three times this week. What are you going to do about it? This time I'm gonna take care of it... ...myself. I'm gonna check on Mrs Danner. Have you noticed any change in behaviour lately? No, ma'am, nothing peculiar. Mrs Banner, I'm told that you've been vomiting in your trash can again. If this continues, I'll be forced to cut off your day room privileges. It's that damn trustee again! I keep telling him to stay away from here. Get out of there! Get out of there! Move away! Attention, please. There's a report from the kitchen that some of you are refusing to take your medication. This is intolerable and will not be permitted. Henceforth, anyone refusing to take their morning pill will have their injection personally administered by me. I'm sure none of you relishes that thought. Stop that! I said, stop that! Orderly! Orderly! Stop that! Stop it! Make them stop it! Make them stop. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it. I said... # Ring-a-round the rosie # Ring-a-round the rosie # A pocket full of posies... # What are you doing out of your rooms? Come on. Back inside, all of you! Do what I say! # Ring-a-round the rosie # A pocket full of posies... # I talked to Dominique's. They're going to send over a darling birthday cake. Do you want to sign the card? Why don't you go ahead and sign it for both of us, Frances? Do you want to know what's in it? - I'm sorry, what? - Kelly's gift. Aren't you a little bit curious about what we got her? I'm sure it'll be fine. You know, maybe I was wrong. Maybe it's better for Kelly to live away from home. I think this sorority experience could be good for her, don't you? Definitely. I'll tell you one thing I'm gonna put my foot down about, though. It's these unscheduled weekend junkets. Hello? Speaking. Who? Oh, yeah, Dr Howell. Yes, I'll hold. It's the sanatorium. Well, all right. Er... thank you, Doctor. Oh, Doctor. You'll keep us posted? Yeah. Seven inmates escaped last night. - Oh, my God. Was... - Yes. But he said not to worry. He said he'd take care of it. These people usually turn up in a clay or so. And we are... what, 300 miles away? Who died? - That was supposed to be a joke. - Where have you been? Mum, don't start on me again. I told you, I just needed a night out before hell week. A little time to myself. I wish you wouldn't do that. - You know how I worry. - Frances! Leave it alone. It's... She's all right. I'm perfectly fine. I even got a little colour. Well, Fairchilds always do look better with a tan. Happy birthday, darling. Woah-ho! Here's to the birthday girl. Do you think I'm attractive? Of course, you're very pretty. Oh, you're not letting Alison's virgin jokes get to you, are you? No... but she's right. I've never had a real boyfriend. Well, if it's that big a deal, why don't you do something about it? I'm sorry. None of my business. Let's change the subject. What are you doing your psych term paper on? Well, I thought I'd do it on the psychological effects of the soap opera. - Oh, that's very topical. - Yeah, but then I thought about it. I realised it was like looking for the meaning of life in a doughnut hole. What are you gonna do yours on? Dreams and nightmares. - Gotta present my idea to me TA today. - Kelly! - Marcia! - Speaking of nightmares... Greetings, Miss Fairchild. How are you doing? Hi, Andy. I gotta go to music class. - Bye! - Bye! Hey, listen, I heard you still didn't have a date for our "come as your favourite suppressed desire" party. Hold on a minute, let me check my schedule here. Well, look at that, it's a miracle. I'm available. - Why don't you ask Megan? - The wicked witch? No way, Jos?. I'm through with her. And I'm late for a meeting. I'll see you later, Andy. - Er... why "dreams and nightmares"? - It's a fascinating subject. Excuse me, but it wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that I'm writing my doctoral thesis on dream analysis, would it? No. - I mean, I didn't know. - You didn't know? I have my own reasons, Mr Adams. It's Peter. I'm sorry. I do get a lot of freshmen coming in here, trying to brown-nose their way through. Pick the teacher's favourite subject, that kind of crap. My reasons are much more personal. What's more personal than a passing grade? Well, you're probably gonna think this is kind of strange, but I have this dream. It's a recurring nightmare, actually, and I've had it ever since I was a little kid, and I've been having it a lot. Recurring nightmare after adolescence, huh? - Does that make me some kind of freak? - No, not at all. It's fairly common for the subconscious mind to fictionalise certain emotional states. You'll learn all about it when you do your paper. Come on, I wanna show you the dream factory. - Dream factory? - Yeah. I mean, it'd be a great place for you to start your research. You've got amnesia, too? You're a very interesting case. How'd you lose your memory? I was nine at the time. We had this treehouse, and... Wait a minute. Treehouse? You actually fell out of a treehouse? Yeah, so I'm told. I was in a coma for three months, and they kept me in this private hospital in Chicago, and when I came out, I had no memory. - Of the accident? - Of the accident and everything before. My name, address... nothing before age nine. What about now? Has the memory come back at all? No, I'm sorry - nothing before the accident. - This is it. - Wow! My little hideaway. Right out of "Better Homes and Gardens", don't you think? Finish telling me about your dream. Well, the nightmare ends with this stranger coming in, fighting with my father. And the strange man ends up catching on fire and burning to death. It's always the same. The last image is of his whole body engulfed in flames. That's beautiful. You got all the classic symbols there. Mum, Dad, fire, strange men... Have you been to see a professional about this - a psychiatrist or psychologist? No, my parents are really down on that kind of stuff. They're not alone. Oh, yes. Meet Heidi, dedicated research assistant. Possesses a delicate feminine aura, as you can see. Cram it, Adams. - Who's the new coed? - Heidi, I want you to meet a genuine recurring nightmare and traumatic amnesiac. Fascinating. You're Peter's type, all right. - Think he'll hook you up? - Hook me up? - Well, that's what we do here. - Create monsters. We monitor dream patterns. Brain waves. With those little babies there. Polysomnograph and electroencephalograph. Those two are interfaced with the units that you see on the desk. Using them, we can monitor a dreaming patient's respiration, muscle contraction, rapid eye movement... - REM. - That's right. Then we wake the patient up, ask them what they dreamed, and let Freud and Jung take over. Wanna try it? It, er... doesn't cost anything. What do you say? You're scared, aren't you? Well, that's natural. Everybody's a little nervous the first time. But really, there's nothing to be afraid of. No, it's not that. What is it then? Kelly? I'll have to think about it. Got yourself a live one, Professor. What are you doing? Looking at a ghost. Isn't that what you see when you look in the mirror? You see a reflection... ...unless you're drunk. Then I suppose you could, er... you could see anything. I've been standing here wondering why we've done this thing. Why we've created this horrible lie. For years I thought it was for Kelly. But it was for us, wasn't it? Wasn't it? You stay there. Did you see something? I don't know. Come on. - Daddy... - Jesus, look at this! Mummy! Whoa, whoa, whoa... - Oh, I'm sorry. - It's all right. 'Can I'm used to it. One guy almost broke myjaw. I want you to lay back down and recount your dream for me as it happened, all right? What about the mirrors? I'd say they're definitely symbolic of something. An unconscious fear perhaps. Or maybe even desire to do in your father. The mirrors allow you to observe without actively participating. That would alleviate any lingering guilt feelings you have. Of course it's only a theory. So, what you're saying is that everything in my dream is symbolic of how I feel? Or felt. It's a classic Freudian dream. Too bad the EEG isn't classic. - What do you mean? - Well, sleeping beauty, your REM and your heart rate are restless as hell - perfect nightmare stuff. But your brainwaves are snoozing. What Heidi is trying to say is, your printout indicated little or no dreaming, probably a malfunction of the machine. It was working fine last night. OK, Heidi, spit it out. What's your theory? Psychic phenomenon. Doubtful. There was REM and muscle contraction. That doesn't mean you can discount hallucinatory waking, memory plants, visions, revelations, - things that don't show up on EEGs. - Science fiction, in other words. Call it what you want, but it sure would explain a few things. I'm late for class. I gotta go. - Heidi. Heidi... - Kelly. Kelly, don't worry about her. She spends her time floating in a twilight zone. Kelly... I gotta go. Can I call you? Sure, I'm always here. Mother, father... Mirrors. - How long will you be gone this time? - I'm OK. Couple of days, I think. Donaldson said some Houston developer's bidding on a new mall, one of those suburban monoliths. We gotta move now if we want to get in on the ground floor. And I may swing by the Waco outlet on my way back. Problems? Mm-mmh. Nothing I can't handle. Well.. I'd better finish packing. - Mother? - Yes, dear? I've been having that nightmare again. Oh, well, it's probably all the excitement. Hi, babe. No. No, I'm at home. Can't talk along. I'll be over in about an hour. Bye. You're too much. I don't know, dear. Sounds to me like he's experimenting with you. What did you say this boy's name was again? Peter Adams. And he's not a boy. He's working towards his doctorate in parapsychology. I don't care. I don't think you should see him again. He'll only confuse you more. Honey, haven't we always taken care of you? I mean, didn't your father get you the best doctors to see you through your amnesia? And I still don't remember anything. Well, what does it matter? You've grown up normal and healthy. - Except for the nightmare. - And they'll go away, too. Given the chance and a little time. I just think an unqualified graduate student is only going to make matters worse. Now, I want you to promise me you won't see him again. I can't do that. - Do you want me to talk to him? - No, I don't want you to talk to him! I will see who I want. - Now, you listen to me, young lady. - No. You listen to me. I'm going to see who I want when I want. Peter Adams is trying to help me, and I'm going to let him. Kelly! Come on, this is crazy. She's right in the next room. No, no, I'm OK. Oh, couple of days, I guess. All right, babe, I'll see you in a little while. Yeah. I love you, too. All right. Anybody out there? Kelly Fairchild! Dwight! Sometime I think that man would forget his head if it wasn't attached. Figured you'd finally given in to Andy. No. - I'm going with Peter Adams. - Oh. - The psych TA? - Sorry. He's gorgeous. How did you manage to rope him? With a nightmare. Interesting approach. Myself, I would have tried nymphomania. Now, I know what you're gonna say. - Fuck you! - Hadn't thought of that. How the hell did you get in here? Well, go out the same way. I'm not going to the party with you. I know that. I already have a date. You're too late, sweetie pie. Oh, yeah? What idiot would ever go out with you? Kelly? My date. - What are you doing here? - Er... raping and pillaging. Leave. Now. I'll pick you up in half an hour. I understand you went home last night. Did you get the keys? Excellent! That puts us right on schedule. See you at the party. I should've told you this is a fraternity party, huh? No problem. I too arrested my development for four years. - Oh, really? What house? - Gamma, iota. I do wish you had told me about this suppressed desire business, though. I would have come as Freud or Jung or somebody. Sorry. - I'm so embarrassed. - Get used to it, kiddo. You're with Ralph Bonner. Better known to friends and enemies alike as "The Boner". This could be the most important night of your life. God help me. Buzz off, nerd! You see, Professor, I have these abnormal sexual desires. It's like, if I'm not getting it every night, I'll die. - You'll die? - Like nymphomania? Oh, Kelly, I didn't see you standing there. I suggest you take two aspirin and go right to bed. With whom? I like a woman who's passive in bed. Lets me take control. None of this aggressive shit. Moaning and groaning? I don't buy it. If a woman is turned on in bed, I know she's insincere. What do you think about it, kiddo? I think you're easily one of the most disgusting human beings I have ever met. Thank you. Hey, later on I'll show you this new dance I've come up with. - I call it "the body bag". - Oh, the body bag! But first... ...you gotta get pickled. - Marcia, - Hmm? - I gotta ask you something. - Hmm? There's an ugly rumour circulating about you. - I wouldn't even bring it up, but... - What? They say you're a virgin. I can't believe this. This is a conspiracy. - Then it's true? - It's none of your business, Ralph. I can help you. I really can. Kiss me. Give yourself to me. Oh, that's it. Wait a minute. Please, I can help you. What did I say? I'm sorry, Peter. I just had to get out of there. It was fun for a while. I don't know, I... I couldn't stop thinking about this other party I went to a long time ago. I think I was around twelve. Yeah. Yeah, I was twelve. Anyway, this, erm... This 50-year-old lady comes up to me and starts talking and asking me these questions. Like, did I have crushes on guys. Did I have a boyfriend. I didn't. I mean, I was too young. Anyway, at the time I thought it was a dumb conversation. But then I realised what she was doing. She'd forgotten her youth. And through me she was trying to live it again. So, ever since then, I mean growing up and everything, I've tried to remember every little thing. Like tonight. I've just been walking around, memorising everything. I don't wanna forget it. And I know I'll never live it again. Weird, huh? Nothing to say, Professor? There are times I know I don't listen enough. I've been thinking I haven't been listening enough to you. You listen. You listen. That's why I... That's why what? That's why I chose you. What is your name? Kelly Fairchild. Do you trust me, Kelly? - Yes. - Good. Then I want you to take me on a little trip with you. A trip back in time. Back to when you were a little girl. When you were nine. Do you remember, Kelly? Mummy... Daddy... - Big house. - That's right. And the treehouse, Kelly. In the backyard of your father's estate. Can you see that day? You're very, very high in the treehouse. And suddenly you're falling. No. No. Houston. Houston? Storm. Lightning. My dolls. My dolls. - What about your dolls? - Broken. - All broken. - Why did you break your dolls? I didn't! I didn't break them. Mummy... Where are you now, Kelly? Mummy's room. That man... That man again. Make him stop. Make him stop! Pardon me. Would you know where Peter Adams is? - I believe he's a teaching assistant. - Yes, why don't you try the basement? Thank you. Fire! Fire! Daddy! Mummy! Smoke! Can't breathe! ' Mummy! ' Kelly! - Mummy! - My God! What are you doing? Stop them. Make them stop, Mummy. Kelly Fairchild, you'll awaken on the count of three. You will be rested and relaxed. - One... - Aman... - Two... - Aman... - Three... - Mummy! - Mummy! - Let go of me, that's my daughter! - Kelly Fairchild... - Randall, for Christ's sake! Kelly Randall! Kelly Randall, you'll awaken on the count of three. One, two, three. Mother, what are you doing here? Oh, thank God you're all right. What are you talking about? Of course I'm all right. What happened? - You relived the night of the fire. - The nightmare? Nightmare, fire, I think it's one and the same. I think that's about enough from you. You go outside and wait for me in the car. - Mother, you don't understand... - Now! I'm not sure, but I think I can have you thrown in jail for what you've just done. I'm quite certain I can have you thrown out of this college tomorrow. Kelly agreed to the hypnosis, Mrs Fairchild. I was trying to help her. Help her? How? By making her relive that damn nightmare? Kelly's troubles have nothing to do with nightmares. I think you know that. I don't want you to talk to her again. Do you understand me? If I hear you have so much as uttered one word to her, I'm gonna have you booted out of here. Why did she respond to the name Randall? You were right. Her nightmare isn't a dream, it's a memory. Kelly tried to kill her father. Some part of her tried to stab him to death. And that's your key - mirrors, split images. Subconsciously, Kelly perceives herself as two different people. Two personalities. Multiple personalities with a splash of schizophrenia. That would explain Mummy's little tantrum. That would also explain why she's never been to a psychiatrist. Yeah. Wouldn't look good for a Fairchild to have a homicidal daughter. Hey, you guys, where's Beth? It's almost time to go. You know, she's afraid we could get into real trouble doing this. I don't think she's into pranks. Kelly, it's your dad's building. What do you think? I think we ought to do it. I mean, the whole idea of this place is to have a good time. Lasting friendships are important. But the bottom line is to have fun. I don't know about you, guys, but I am so ready for it. - Good. Got the keys? - Mm-hmm. You're going to go ahead and turn off the alarm system, right? If anybody gets caught, I want it to be you. Remember, we won't be far behind you. I hope everyone's gone to the bathroom? Who's there? The grace of Delta Rho Chi be with you. The grace of Delta Rho Chi be with you. What about Kelly? Doesn't she get the blessing? She'll live without it. The grace of Delta Rho Chi be with you. All right, ladies, in the car. - Get in. - No. This is crazy. You've gone too far, Megan. I didn't come to college for this Girl Scouts shit. We're grown women. Look at us - candles, prepubescent songs... We should be doing something instructive, something positive. Not breaking into a stupid department store. Either get in or pack your bags, wise-ass. You're fucking crazy, you know that, Megan? Completely wacko. - They ought to lock you up in the zoo. - You're out! Understand? Gone. We'll vote on it tomorrow. Don't bother. I quit. Pack my bags tonight, I'll be gone tomorrow. It's all Megan said. We're to wait here till she shows up - with the rest of the pledges. - Give me a hit on that, will you? You know, I... I like paper bags around my booze. No, it just adds a certain touch of class, a kind of a je ne sais quoi. - Cheers! - Duck! That's them. - Where's your car? - I parked across the street. I didn't want anyone else to see it. Where's Beth? I'll tell you about it later. Unlocked? Good. You have one hour to get the uniform. Then come back here. I'll be waiting. Key? Where are we going? So, where is he? He's on his rounds, like I said. Let's go. OK, here's the plan. Alison, in about three minutes you're gonna set up a diversion on this floor. - A performance. - Like what? I'm sure you'll think of something. Meanwhile, Marcia will stay here and head him off, just in case you miss him. Er, his name is Todd. So, just tell him you're a friend of mine. He won't do anything. What are you gonna do? I'm going up to the guards' lounge. Alison, wherever he is, it is your job to attract his attention. - I'll go get the uniform. - How can you, if he's down here? They keep spares in the lounge. Megan will never know the difference. - I love it! I love it! - Let's go. Come on, come on. Come on, let's go. OK. Now, here's the plan. Be quiet. They can hear you. We'll split up into two groups. Andy and me and you two guys. Sounds complicated, but I think we can handle it. And remember - don't let them see you, and no pledge leaves the store until she's had the shit scared out of her. - The shit scared out of her. - Shit scared out of her. - Shit scared out of her. - Got the shit scared out of her. OK, let's go. Come on, come on, let's go. Todd? Todd? Toddy? On, Toddy? Uh! Hmm... Well, looky here. Sorry about this, kid, but I need these more than you do. You guys are crazy if you think I'm gonna stay here all night. Oh, Todd, where are you? Come out, come out. I got something for you I think you'll like. So, er... don't shoot. Toddy? Oh, come on, don't be bashful. Kelly? Hey, Marcia. Where have you been? I've been looking everywhere for you. - This is a big place. - Where's Kelly? How should I know? I haven't seen anything. Marcia? Marcia! I thought I saw someone up there. Oh, come on, you're just spooked like I am. - Hey. - Oh, wow, you got the uniform. Yeah, no sweat. - What did you tell the nightwatchman? - What nightwatchman? - You mean you haven't seen him yet? - I haven't seen anyone. Except for when you used the elevators. Elevators? I've been using the escalators. Hey! We're supposed to be scaring the pledges. I know, but this is more fun. Besides, we've got all night for that. OK, OK, but we'll do it my way. What, whips and chains? Not until I say so. Er... the skates stay behind. - Oh, come on, Kelly. - No. The only thing we're taking is this uniform and the wine. on! Who's there? I said, who's there? Scared the shit out of them. All right! Scared the shit out of them... - Whoo! - Who was it? No mistaking those cone-heads! Chad and Ralph. Come on, let's get out of here. I told you we couldn't trust that bitch. She left! No key, no way out. What's now, great leader? Well, the only thing we can do is go back and look for them. Come on, let's split up. Marcia, wait for me. - Do you love it? Do you love it? - Oh, yes! - Catch me if you can. - Megan! Megan... oh, shit! Megan, you... Megan. Megan. Andy? Megan? Megan? Ooh-hoo-hoo-ee. Megan. Oh... game's over, Megan. Time to get down to the business of scaring your pledges. Not me. Lights are out. Better go for it. Be cool, mama. Megan, would you please stop fooling around. This really isn't funny anymore, Megan. Not too funny at all. Oh. Megan! L got YOU, Megan. Andy? Andy? I was only kidding, honey. We can't sit in this building all night. Well, maybe it's the nightwatchman who's playing all these games. Oh, God, Marcia, you are so naive. Megan's the one behind this, sure as shit. Apparently, she's not alone. Well, maybe the nightwatchman has the key, you know. We could... Forget the nightwatchman. He either cut out early or was never here in the first place. It's an old Chinese custom. He who divideth, conquereth. Well, where shall I go? Find a good place to hide and wait. They'll show their ugly faces eventually. Now, count to twenty and take off. One, two, three... Andy... Andy? Andy! What are you...? Very funny! Kelly! You scared me. - Did you hear the crash? - Yes, this was bound to happen. We gotta go find those guys. There they go. Come on. - They've got to be in one of those. - Who is it? I didn't see their faces. - Let's go after them. - Wait a minute. Let's wait for them to come out, OK? Wouldn't it be... You wait. I'll go after them. Scared the shit out of them! Your faces! Jesus, you should've seen your faces! All right! - Your faces! - All right! Did you guys break something? Who? Me? No, no. Where's Alison? She almost had me back there. We don't know. Who else is with you guys? Megan and Andy. We split up about an hour ago. Actually, I'm glad you caught us, 'cause I was getting kind of spooked myself running around this dump. You are getting spooked? Terrific, Ralph! You're not gonna believe this. Boy, have I got a bundle for you. Wait till you see all this. - Oh, boy. Current events. - Not so current. It's from the "Houston Times". Erm... Ten years, one month, five days ago. I knew it! There really was a fire. But in a man named Randall's house. Like it says in the article, he was burned over 40% of his body. - Just the way Kelly dreamed it. - It gets better. This Randall, Jason Randall, "floor manager, Houston's Fairchild's department store, wife's name..." "...Frances! "Rumoured to be in the house with the Randalls was Dwight Fairchild, "Chairman of the Board, Fairchild department stores." Kelly didn't try to kill her father. She tried to kill the man who was sleeping with her mother, Dwight Fairchild. And the stranger in her dreams was actually her real father. Jason Randall. You remember the name that Frances used to get Kelly out of hypnosis? It was Randall. That's how I got on this track. - Kelly doesn't even know. - Thanks to the amnesia. The wedding announcement. "Married in a private ceremony, Frances Randall and Dwight Fairchild." Two months after the fire. - I hope that's all. - This one's gonna blow you away. That's dated last Monday. I plugged the name Randall in "The Times"' computer. "Six inmates escaped late last night from the rural Fireside Sanatorium. "Also reported missing was a nurse, Gladys Higgins, and an in... "inmate groundskeeper, Jason Randall." Now we know what happened to the real father. Ferreted away in a private sanatorium. Read this one. "Nurse found murdered. "Being sought in connection with the killing was Jason Randall. "lnmate groundskeeper." At the sanatorium where the victim was employed. - Who are you calling? - Kelly. - No answer? - No. Yeah, I'd like the number for Dwight Fairchild, please. Oh, come on. Thank you very much. - I wish you'd tell me what... - I'm trying to find Kelly. What would she be doing there? Hello. Hello, is anybody there? 'Hello?' Hello? Damn! This is very strange. Busy. - Where are you going? - The Fairchild estate. No, thanks. I'll just sit here and finish grading your papers. To Dwight Fairchild for making all this possible. And to being young, staying young, and dying young. Hear, hear. I wanna propose a toast. A toast to, erm... - I forgot. - Ah, she forgot. I think we're seeing Dr Jekyll's other side. I heard that. I heard that, Alison. You think you're so much better than me, just because you sleep around a lot. Well, for all your information, lam not a virgin. Don't. Stop it. I wanna finish. No one ever lets me finish. I was... twelve. Twelve years old. There was this... old man. My violin teacher. He, erm... Yeah, he had a chubby face. And he had, er... clammy hands. And one day... ...he, er... oh, he touched me. And then he, er... He took me. Oh, God. I never told anybody this. Not even my mother. Excuse me, folks, but I have just got to go and take a leak. I'll help you find it. I hope you're referring to the bathroom. What? No jokes? Sorry. Fresh out. I thought you came here to cheer me up. How do you feel now? Cheered up. A little. Wait here. I'll be right back. Leaving me at the altar? Start without me. My eyeballs are floating. And on the third day, God said... ...let there be rain. Oh, shit. Damnit, Alison, I just peed all over my leg. Alison? 'Attention. Your attention, please.' Megan and Andy, we know you're out there, and we'd love to leave you here all night, 'but as you well know, you've got the only key.' Look, we already have Chad and Ralph, guys, so the game's over. 'Meet us at the service entrance. Now!' Over and out. Oz has spoken. With this ring, I thee wed. You need a flower. Chad, Chad, Chad... Chad, Chad, Chad... Oh, no! Oh... Oh... Oh, God! Oh, please, Kelly! I saw them! I saw them, they were... What? What are you talking about? I saw Chad and a knife... He was dead. Oh, my God! Where? Where are they? The bathroom. The stall. Back by the bridal... Show me. You've got to take me there. No! No, I can't... I can't. I won't go back there again. OK. OK, you don't have to, Alison. Erm... Go to the security desk and wait for me there. You'll be safe. OK. God... I have to warn the others. Oh, Alison. Oh, Alison. Alison, I'm coming. Alison? Oh, my God. Mrs Fairchild, I'm Peter Adams. We met back at the college. Excuse me, is everything all right? Mrs Fairchild, I'm looking for Kelly. I thought... I thought she might be here. Mrs Fairchild... Would you pour me a drink, please? Is your husband here, Mrs Fairchild? Dwight? Yes. My husband is dead. They found him two blocks from his building. Murdered. Hello? Hi, it's Peter Adams. ls Kelly there? Hi, Peter. It's Beth. No, they're all gone. - They're on a pledge prank. - 'Where?' - Peter, I... - 'Damnit, Beth, it's urgent.' They're in the Fairchild building. 'Peter? Hello?' Keys. Do you have keys to the building, Mrs Fairchild? I need the keys. Do you have the keys? Keys... Keys! OK. Now, I want you to help me. I want you to call the police. Have them meet me at the building. Do you understand? Have them meet me there. Kelly could be in danger. - Kelly? - That's right. Call the police. Do you understand? It's happening again. Well? Tell me. Was I as fantastic as I think I was? Ralph, I don't have a lot to compare you to. But I'd say... maybe a seven. - Inches. - Hmm-hmm... you're always joking. That's a way to cover up my insecurities, I guess. Really? Comedians live a very lonely life. I thought you were a business major. - Yeah, my father's idea. - What about your mother? She insisted I be named Ralph after Ralph Kramden on "The Honeymooners". - Hmm, she's a comedian, too. - Yeah, a closet one. She used to make up these jokes and send them into magazines. And she wrote a hundred of them. She never, never got one published. Not one. That's my life story... of which you are now a part. - Thanks. - "Thanks"? Thanks for making this a special night. Did you hear the one about...? No more jokes, Ralph. Again? - It's customary at our age. - OK. What was that? Nothing. It's just a bump in the night. Ralph? What is this, another joke? I hear you, Marcia. Kelly! I'm coming, Marcia. Kelly! Help me! Ralph! Ralph! - Ralph! Ralph! He was... - What? - Where? - Behind me. - He was behind me. - Oh, God! - No! - Yes, we have to! - We've been trapped in here. - No, no, we can't... Oh, my God, Kelly. It's all right. Shh! It's all right. We're between floors. We'll wait... here till morning, OK? It's OK. No one's gonna get us here. Shh... Marcia. - I promise we'll get out of here. I promise. - Please. We will. - Ralph was so... - Shh! Don't think about it. I just remember his face. I... I can still see his eyes, just... Shh! Think about something else. Pretend you're outside. In a field... ...that stretches as far as you can see. And Alison's there. And Chad. And everyone. Come on! Come on! Kelly! Wait for me! Marcia! Kelly! Help! Help! Marcia! Stop it! Stop it! Oh! Kelly! Little Kelly... Oh, my God. What did I do? Jason Randall. Kelly? Kelly. Oh, God. Oh, it's all right. I know you don't understand. I can explain. Everything's gonna be all right. Peter. It's like looking in the mirror. Isn't it, Kelly? Leave me alone. All these years, you've been seeing the sights of the world, and I've been stuck in that place. I got out, though. And I've been watching you. Yes, I've been following you, watching you at your sorority. Looking at you through the windows, and now you've gone and killed our poor daddy out there. Our daddy! He's been following me just everywhere, picking up after his little daughter. Hiding the dead. But he'll be blamed for all that. And now, I'll become you! Help! No! Goodnight, sister darling. No, please... Hey, Johnson. Make sure that the parking lot's cordoned off. Er, yes, sir. I called in the extra units. Get that car out of here. It's time to go, Mrs Fairchild.
