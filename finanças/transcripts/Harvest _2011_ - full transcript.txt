Lucas SHTELTNER and KAI-MICHAEL MUELLER in film BENJAMIN Cantu Town, village, lake Every herd has 50 cows two bulls for breeding and their calves. Bulls mate with cows which then calving pasture. If the mother can not freaks calf for example because they are twins they degenerate hand in the barn. chasing animals makes them restless. Some become aggressive. Therefore, all involved must do their work quickly and precisely. On August 4, 2006 I started training to become a farmer. At first, I had difficulty in I deal with everything. I was really serious to get up on time. But you have created a good reputation I often put a lot of work that other practitioners did not want to do: They take driving lessons and it was not "their job". The training showed me, you do not have to be afraid of technology. As we know, one learns life. See all those cows! Stay peaceful now. Where is? - Here. We can try the calf. Are you scared? - Perhaps. Are you afraid or not? Stay there! We'll catch the other side. What's wrong? - Saves up! They look so angry. Hold still now. Can you see?

Some time ago We talked much what happened with you in your family, all that you've been through as a child and your family problems, but at one point you must be prepared put line and say, "I am grown up Marco not Mark - son. This is now my life. and I will not allow this in which I went over to pull me back! " This will not lead anywhere. - What about me... deal with the work. I do my January Yes it is. - But the paperwork ... You're a good worker. We have no complaints about it. And this is the point: this is exactly the reason we want to keep them, if you take your final exam. But the possibility is not enough. You have to want it. We have no doubt that the physical and intellectual exactly for this job But you have to want it. You have to want it. Do you want to work and are two different things. It is important domestic terms. Still really not sure whether it's good for me. I mean to work here. Want to take you to work or not? I have to say on board What are you going to do. I do not know. - This complicates things a bit. Should I do that? - Good for my fingers. Yeah right. If your finger is better now becoming only 30 will move. Do you think you will live to 30? - Do not you think so? I do not know... Want it? Thankfully, working time is over. At last! What a day only! Am I sweating? - Nasty! Really stinks! All this work. Makes long movements! Just kidding. Go on! Are you crazy? It's not scary! If only light you slide your hand .. This knife will not make a big white definitely! 80 ... 90 ... 1 euro.

Sit down and drink a beer. - You know I do not drink. Where are you going? - Come on. Sit less. I'll see you tomorrow. - Do not be such! Eat your organic trash then. - You made me eat this.

Tell us a little about yourself. I'm from Ludwigsfelde and ... I started training for work in a bank, but I decided to quit. What made you decide to be go about farming rather than banking? I do not know. It just was not my thing. There is a great difference in pay between banks and farms. And I think they are very conceited! This too. What earns a beginner bank clerk? The first year you take about 800 euros per month Sad but true. And it will not change soon. Bankers will always receive more. than people in production. I just want to say something: responsible for areas authorized you instruct. If they tell you to do something, do not reply: "You can not command me, loser!" Who said so? - Does not matter. "Loser?" Nobody would say so ... - Reports me ... I just wanted to make it clear "Report to me?" What does it mean? Or tell what you mean or do not say anything? Beat him in the head, you should treat others with respect. Otherwise, I have to cover it in your recommendations. You go with Catherine. Do not be afraid to come and get me ask if you have any questions. All right. Successful first day Jacob! - Thank you. Do not you take a shower today? Damn it! What pushed? It is OK.

As we come and see that one cows hopping left and right or ears and sharpened or her head tilted side then we know that something's wrong. We must be careful if you have a calf. But nobody happened to him so far, knock on wood. Now what? - No, not there. This right to your knee. Disconnect the two wires. They are not under pressure? - No. Do not be afraid. Not under tension. Simply disconnected from the insulators. Exactly. Now pull them behind your car or sideways. And so it is. - Is it OK? Not so far. Then you will go kilometers on foot to get them back.

I will try to catch the calf. If the cow to leave me, do so and say, "Get out!" But do not run away! Calm, calm ... Get out, get out! Right? - Yes, yes, exactly. Go away! - Easy now ... Watch her mouth is closed. I do not want us slobbering purposes. Go away. Calm! Calm! Watch cow, not me! Pull now! Calm. Everything is fine. Do not go mad now! Calm! Everything is fine!

Soon you'll have one foot! Go! Get out! So you're thinking, right? - Stay a little coffee? Will have drained whatever. What happens if you merge blonde with a husky? Blonde and husky? I have no idea. Or stupid dog or ninth song bitch. Would me the ashtray? What is Mrs. Butch? - Mrs. Butch? It is like our second mother all of us. Did you odeve? I had a small scratch and: "Oh, let him namazhem drug " It is great. I helped me get back driver's license. They took my book for four years. - What have you done? I drove drunk. Caught me on the border. They opened the door and fell inside two bottles of vodka. Seriously? - We were five. Me me out of the car and they took my blood sample on the spot. Shit! It helped me when squabbling with her mother. I do not get along with her boyfriend and she threw me out of the house. So, no place to live. And she let me settle an apartment. Right here in Yenikendorf. One-room apartment. I will not find anything so fast without her help. You also may want I will take it from Dad. Really bad. - Hey, it could've been worse.

Will go ... Excuse me, do you know where Mrs. Butch? Mrs. Butch is in the conference room. - Thank you. Here it is explained how to write a report. And your success so far It has reached the requirements. Few have to admit to preliminary exam. Hello. - Jacob? I can come back later. - No, go. Marco difficulties writing reports. And I'll have to do it. - What? To write reports. Everyone is obliged to write. If you think school is over while you practice, I will disappoint. Mark, could you gave him several sheets to try and he? Sit down. Do not despair so easily. - Not too many, right? Do not, for example, when you were the mill processing carrots. So you can describe the technology process there in his report. Writing reports, is not different by writing an essay in school. And you should do the same only for plowing. Your report should be focus on plowing, to show that you understand all stages of this activity. Why should I write about? Now I do it for the fifth time. Exactly because of that. Nobody will read it so why write it? I will read it to check if he understood everything. And finally you yourself will understand better. But I will not read it. And you must write such reports to be admitted to the final exam. Let me help you? - No. Imagine that you go to the bank and all they say: "This stupid farmer can not even to write". That's how things are. Imagine that you give a document and you can not even understand it. Now let's finish this sentence. Will not do it! No! Will not do it! Here's your paper. Come on!

But it's so expensive ... Is everything alright? What's wrong? Fuck you with me? Tell me, what's wrong. Good morning. Good morning. Jakob. You do not lightly dressed? Well, how's it going? Do you work? Yes of course. - But it is hard work, right? Getting up early, due to burrowing of shit and so on ... No, it is normal. Everything else okay? - Yes.
