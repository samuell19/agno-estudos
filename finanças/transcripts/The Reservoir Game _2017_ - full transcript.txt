THIS MOVIE IS A RECORD OF JIN-WOO JOO'S RELENTLESS PURSUIT OF MB'S SECRET FUNDS You really have to fight against a truly huge organization, right? I've given it my all, investigating this story for over two years and I've reported it faithfully. MURDER OF GEUN-HYE PARK'S FIRST COUSIN Was he in his underwear or was he naked? Underwear... Can you make a statement regarding Nam-gi Baek... Then why on the 14th, I mean 11th, during the reinvestigation, did Si-hyung Lee say that he lied? NAEGOK-DONG SPECIAL PROSECUTOR It was never said that it was a donation to the nation. JEONGSU SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION DONATION And the person who watched this all the way through with me... "Let's wash our hands of this now." I was threatened a lot, but I was not afraid. What I really hate the most is the distortion of truth. I just want to say that I worked hard, as a reporter. But the money disappeared. It was sent over there. Sent where? I don't know! The money, transferred to Canada was sent somewhere else afterwards. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm done. I told you, it might be found at the reservoir. Don't take this seriously, okay? I'll try to shed some light on that. I'll take care of this one. I'll tear it into pieces. Bullshit! If it's not found at the reservoir, you'll get killed during the hike. No, I can do it. I will do it. I'm ferocious within. If working hard is a crime, then I'll receive my punishment. If that's the state of the present, I can't do much about it. Bastard. Why does Myung-bak Lee appear in my dream? Him and his son. These freaking bastards. Myung-bak Lee appeared in Alabama. There's a DAS factory there. He appeared far too much. -Did you meet him? -Of course. Nothing much happened. He said, "You're here again?" and greeted me warmly. I heard that you've been pursuing a certain someone for four or five years now. Yeah, it's been actually five years since I began pursuing this person. The money disappears whenever it goes to a certain place. These mysterious things keep happening. The first one I started investigating was worth hundreds of billions of won. It was a huge project but in that neck of the woods, it was a small job. So this person did this project with MB's people. The project was a success and he gained a huge profit. He received the money and a diplomat passport and went overseas. Soon after, he realized that out of the people involved in the project he was the one who received the least. Once he found that out, the former accomplice felt betrayed and it triggered a sense of animosity so he began to tell me this little story. So I followed the tracks and the money was sent to Singapore first, then to Canada, then it disappeared at the Cayman Islands, the tax haven. I followed it all the way to Canada. But after it was sent to the tax haven, the borrowed-name bank account disappeared. So I stopped there. But I was following another case that was related to MB. The money was sent to Singapore, then to Canada, and to the Cayman Islands. Again, it disappeared there. -It's the same pattern. -Yes. But the biggest portion from that case was in Canada and then it was transferred from RBC, the Royal Bank of Canada, to the tax haven. Any Sei-hoon Won stories? He had that pouch... The pouch... I'm sure there is, deep down but I don't have any evidence. Let's say we go to the US. The consuls and the assistants are usually all with him but he always traveled alone. His secretary was so shocked. But he would always go to Canada alone when he'd visit the US. I have no idea why he'd travel incognito to Canada. If it was undercover spy work, the head of the NIS wouldn't be the one in the field. How can he? It's not like he's 007. -Ma'am. -Yes. -Is this Mrs. Won? -Yes. I'm reporter Jin-woo Joo from Sisa In, hello. -No. -Really? He didn't travel to Canada often. I see. So he traveled often to the US. You just said so yourself, that he had a lot of work overseas. Yes, not just the US, he went to lots of places. He went to Canada especially often when he was in the US. At least, based on my reports. He didn't travel to Canada a lot. Did he not? -No, he didn't. -I heard that he took a hefty amount of NIS money in his diplomatic pouch when he... It's totally false. Mr. Won went with his workers, NIS agents at first but then later on, went by himself. There is no record of such a thing. Look it up. I have no idea. WHY DID SEI-HOON WON GO TO CANADA? I found the secret funds of President Chun's son before, which resulted in President Chun's second son getting arrested. So you can say that I have a know-how for finding secret funds. And there is a line of connections on that end but during President Myung-bak Lee's time, the secret fund lumps were just floating everywhere. I took the two accounts that looked like secret fund reservoirs and the company, the shell company, the one with 'Lee' as its account holder. I took all of that to the United States and hired a detective. -Hello. -Nice to see you. How have you been? -You gave me one account. -Yes. And this bank account was not a valid one. When someone wrote the account they either wrote it wrong by mistake or deliberately matched it up to a similar account. You can set up a shell company without an address or a social security number or a passport number. You basically need nothing, right? It's not hard, yes. You can have one within half a day. You don't need any help whatsoever. A close associate said that he trusts no one when it comes to money so he continued to make it so that only he could have access. So even if there is a risk, he'd use his name -or something related to it? -Yeah. Yes. And then he'd say the government, the Korean government will never get in his way so it's all okay. -I dug up to "Lee Myung." -Okay. So I thought, let's check it out. It was a gamble, honestly. Mr. Joo, what do you do when you make a deposit at the bank? -You go to the bank, right? -Yes, I go... You take some identification, get confirmed, and then give the bank your money? Yes. That's the second class. The system between what we normal people know and the banking system that the upper class use are very different. -Yes. -You need to know if this person is second class, first class, or the upper class, so to speak. If they are in the upper class, everything I'm telling you now is useless. The common knowledge that we all own, that's useless too. -Right. -What if he's super upper class? Then he may not even need a name. If you try to pursue him and trace via normal methods, I don't think you'll obtain any real solid results. But anyhow... -Yeah, I didn't gain anything from there. -Okay. -I was crushed. -You were discouraged. -Because my bet failed. -Right. -So I came back and was on another case. -Okay. I encountered this Canadian loan scam. So this money went through some stuff, got to Canada, and escaped through -the Cayman Islands, remember? -Right. But this exact plot was repeated to me, verbatim. But this person said, It is somewhere, right? It has to be. It's in the Royal Bank of Canada. I saw it. North York seemed too small for something Myung-bak Lee would do. Because it was the first one he ever did. Back in 2007? 2008? Then he started getting bolder and greedier. After that succeeded, he realized how to go about it. It made me think, this is for real. That is why. These coincided perfectly.. And I think the North York trial is the easiest. Do you know how much money is in that? Myung-bak will be ruined. I saw it. You must have lit up when you heard about North York. I got chills, yeah. The more I heard it, the more I was convinced that it was exactly what I had heard before. There was a small, a very small business in Canada. It was a project finance to develop a mixed-use condominium in North York, Toronto, a big hub. And NH Bank NH BANK makes a 21 billion won loan commitment to this CTGK. A 21 BILLION WON LOAN COMMITMENT CTGK, they say they do overseas real estate consultations. They were established on August 27, 2008. Their loan was approved August 28th and disbursed September 9th. The whole process was carried out extremely fast indeed. NH BANK LOAN APPROVED THE DAY AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMPANY I wondered how much money this company had but they had absolutely no assets. NO ASSETS WHATSOEVER But they lent them the money without any collateral. Then they refused repayment the year after. NO PLANS FOR LOAN COLLECTION They lent money to a company with no experience, no collateral and won't even try to collect it either. This is impossible for a bank to do. The chief developer, Joseph Lee. He scammed 12 million dollars in a condo scam. Related parties were arrested but Joseph escaped to Korea. So basically, Joseph Lee who scammed people of 12 million dollars, wasn't reported or sued. NH Bank didn't take any action. They're just keeping quiet. WHY WON'T THEY REPORT JOSEPH LEE? It's strange. Jin-woo, why must you pursue this so relentlessly? I don't know. I think I'm crazy. But I just want them to know that there is someone who's on their trail. If we find that reservoir, the one we suspect someone is holding, then the tables might turn. And if the government changes, we can use this as a stepping stone to go further. That's what I think. THE KOREA TIMES DAILY Shall we go? A lot of big buildings have been built in this area as of late. It's a bit far off from the city, from downtown, but it's still a pretty big neighborhood. Yeah. It would've been pretty good if this Centrium project went ahead according to plan. -Here, it's... -Yes, it's what you see here. -That's the police station. -Yeah. The police is... here. -Here, right? On the left. -Yes. So from here to there? They said that they will build the biggest condominium with Korean funds in the area with the most Korean residents, -hence the huge attention. -Okay. But now, the construction has to begin. -They've staked out the construction area -Yeah. but not one shovel is being lifted for years. It's housing fraud. Stereotypical housing fraud. HOUSING FRAUD The lawyer in charge of the trust account -says they've transferred the money -Okay. to the developer company. -By accident. -Okay. HOUSING PAYMENTS DISAPPEARED And the lawyer involved in this, in this Korean-Canadian society... -A very respected and influential lawyer. -Exactly. -She did a lot of work. -Okay. She helped out with a lot of refugees, she was quite well-known. MEE-RAI CHO What about Joseph Lee? Investigation on Joseph Lee has still yet to begin. -Still? -Still. WHY HASN'T JOSEPH LEE BEEN INDICTED IN CANADA? The person who handed over the money was indicted. The number of indictments is like, 500 or 501. There were 501 victims of this case. But, there were no investigations conducted on Joseph Lee, the very person who received the money. Well, Mee-rai Cho's trial keeps getting delayed too. Is she still active as a lawyer? No. The Law Society, in a manner of disciplinary punishment, -suspended her license. -License suspension. While Joseph Lee's in Korea, there is someone who acted as the CEO of Centrust in place of Joseph here. He works in mortgage here. Moon. The name is Moon. He was basically Joseph Lee's pawn. You should go talk to him, maybe. This is it, Suite 200. Press 200 then pound key. That's it, right? Let's just go in. It's open. It's here. Wow, it's big. Mortgage. Is he there? Excuse me. Hello. We're from Seoul. I'm Jin-woo Joo and I'm a reporter. -Are you Mr. Moon? -Yes. We are here to ask you a few questions about the Centrium case. First of all, why are you even investigating this? So why, after all this, this was a huge issue in Toronto, right? So why did you start investigating this... -After that... -Tell me your backstory. In Korea, there weren't any cases like this, in which banks and conglomerates actively... So why are you investigating this? What's your drive? That's it. That's it. I've heard rumors that even when he started this business, that Samsung had his back, that the government was helping him out. This is a huge business... Then it wouldn't have gone out of business. Wouldn't it? Why would it If Samsung really had been a sponsor? But Samsung did dip their feet in it, they just backed out later. Right. Since it didn't benefit them. How did you know about me? At the time, in this venture... Did you talk to people? Yeah, I've met up with a few. -Here? -Yes. And they gave you my name. No, well, they said you knew things, that you were knowledgeable... What did Joseph Lee do? What job did he have before this? Was he always in real estate? No, I heard that he used to be a CPA. And you didn't know each other from the past? I met him through this project. You guys started off your venture with help from the Korea Exchange Bank of Canada, the one in North York, right? And then 21 billion won comes in from NH Bank. You got the biggest problem solved, you had everything you needed, why did the business fall apart? First, we got the money to buy the land lot, right? BOUGHT LAND LOT WITH MONEY FROM NH BANK But that's not it. There are interest payments, all the blueprints, floor plans, all the drawings have to be paid for. Not to mention the fees for consultants. And these payments have to be made regularly, on time, but it was not. It just wasn't. In the past ten or twenty years there was a surge of condo development. The developers who've been here for a while, they all know who's doing what job and so on. But then some Korean named Joseph Lee came along and started doing something. But the city didn't give them a permit. Why? Because just by a glance you could tell they were inexperienced. Could they really handle a project of this scale? But why can't they JOSEPH LEE, CENTRUST CEO investigate Joseph Lee? Why are you asking me that? Am I the police? No, this project... I've been summoned by the police. They told me to come. They asked me basically what you just asked me. And he said he'll bring money from Korea... -Have you met Seok-bae Park? -Who? Seok-bae Park. This company, CTGK, the CEO, Seok-bae Park was born in 1980. He was born in 1980. So at the time of this case, I'm not really sure exactly how old but early 30's? -At the time of the loan commitment, -Yeah. he had no assets, no wealth, no experience or skills, he had nothing. -A bit strange. -Very. -Have you met him? -No, not yet. His name is registered under the company. My name nor I am not affiliated with this in any way. I am aware. -Seok-bae Park is the CEO. -How do you know? Even the police didn't know. -Seok-bae Park is the CEO of CTGK. -Yes. Then you should go see him. The NH Bank loan was signed under his name. Right. SEOK-BAE PARK He knew almost nothing about this field. There wasn't any mediator or anything in the middle, so I was perplexed as well. I thought, maybe he had some kind of connection somewhere. Maybe he stashed away some money somewhere? Only he knows the truth. I don't know. Only he'd know. It is very rare for a person to be able to manhandle conglomerates and banks this easily. It's evident that a huge power was in action behind the scenes. And like how that man was perplexed, the fact that the Canadian police, and the investigative authorities, both here and in Korea, have left Joseph Lee completely alone, and are sitting on their hands. How could this be possible, if not for a huge power backing him up? There is a bit of a strain though, between him and Joseph Lee. It's small, but it's there. Maybe because of financial issues. Yeah. But, he won't spill the beans. It's not a well-to-do neighborhood, it's just a middle class neighborhood? Is that right? It doesn't seem like it. Then did they move out here because they were pushed out? I don't know. Maybe. Ms. Cho! Are you home? Ms. Cho? Ms. Cho! Hello, Ms. Cho. -You are Ms. Mee-rai Cho, right? -Yes, why are you here? So, I... You know, North York... I wanted to ask you a few questions about the Centrium project. I'm sorry, but I would appreciate it if you talked about that with my lawyer. But you're a lawyer. -I have a lawyer too. -Okay. This is very rude of you to come knocking on my door unannounced. I'm sorry, but we came from Seoul. -Even so, this is still too much. -We came to meet you. Ms. Cho, let me just give you my number. Ms. Cho, please. I do apologize. Ms. Cho, just one question, please. I came all the way from Seoul for this. Why is Joseph Lee not being punished? I can call the police on you, for trespassing. -I was also a journalist back in the day, -Okay. -I know what the profession is like. -Cool. -This is very rude of you. -Okay. -You did ask a very good question, but... -Yes. Ms. Cho. You said it was a very good question! I'll just leave my name card here. She said, "Talk to her lawyer." She looked terrible, though. Really. -What she was wearing, everything. -Okay. I was a bit shocked. -Was it that bad? -Yeah. When I checked her house conditions... -The gardens were wild. -No care given to it. The inside's the same. -You saw the inside too? -Inside, the curtains were drawn like this and she had a fan facing the inside from the out, spinning like this. But after she closed the door, she closed the drapes, turned off the fan, and walked further inside. She's basically built a wall and is hiding from the world right now. It was eerily like Süskind's The Story of Mr. Sommer. I asked her one last question before I left. I asked her why Joseph Lee isn't getting punished. She said, "That's a very good question. but I cannot give you an answer." Let's go. I received this tip-off from another source. Joseph Lee spent money like water. He literally threw them on the street. He chucked thousands of dollars just on the street. I don't know if she was his girlfriend but every time she asked for allowance, he'd give her thousands of dollars, he'd buy her purses. He lived a pretty luxurious life. Joseph Lee owned a few penthouses here. I'm sure he sold them before he bounced. I thought he gave them to his wife, but he didn't do that either. -Why don't we try meeting his wife? -We should. -Do you know her contact information? -No. If you want to know, you have to go to church. The pastor there is Pastor... He's basically the main -caregiver for this family right now. -Oh, is he? We should reach out to him then. If you approach him in the right way, he'll be able to tell you a lot of things. He's helping them out of compassion and pity. -Was he a believer? -He was. Well, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016. That's four years. It's 2013, so three years. So about seven or eight years. You gave me chills. That's exactly what I said. "Why would NH Bank give you money? Based on what?" I said I just didn't get it. Then what did he say? He said he'd just take care of it because he had it under control. He said he could get money from the conglomerate. Okay. So I don't know what happened there. That was out of my hands. I don't have any Korean connections, I don't know anyone from any conglomerate. So in Korea, He... He met with some big shot's son who was affiliated with a huge company. JOSEPH LEE SEOK-BAE PARK He kept talking about it. A BIG SHOT'S SON. He told me his friend's father will help him out. But I don't think it's Seok-bae. He has a limit, he has no money! -Yeah, he's nothing. -Exactly. So it may be Seok-bae's friend instead. THE BIG SHOT It's not directly related to Joseph, but I don't know for sure. When you were working with Joseph, did he ever say anything like, someone's watching out for me or they've got my back? I'm like, 90 percent sure that he never said that. He doesn't have connections anyway. -But NH Bank... -That's why I thought -Seok-bae had connections. -Yeah? Because Seok-bae... Joseph at least has brains that work and he gets work done, he does work. But Seok-bae is nothing. How did you know that? You're a strange one. -He was young, he was a nobody. -How did you even... He was nothing. -Who was the son? -Who knows? Well, he... Based on my encounters with him, he really thought this project will work out. The last time I met him was at the airport, they came together. They had met on the plane. And this man, who just landed on a plane, was wearing a track suit. A track suit. Not a suit, but a track suit. I still don't get it because it was a case that happened simultaneously in Canada and Korea which meant he wasn't a person who should've been running about. He must have had Interpol warnings on him, this was such a huge case. So how could he have gotten past Interpol? You know that by how he's dressed, how he talked, just his overall self, that this was the end. I said, "You'll die like that, take care of yourself." And that was, in short, he had to come say his farewells to me before he left. But then he disappeared within a week. And then I read the newspaper and saw the Mee-rai Cho case. I saw him the week before. -It was the biggest fraud, scam case -The biggest. in the history of Toronto. It was huge in Korea too. But the Korean law enforcement, NH Bank, the financial institutions, -none of them sue Joseph Lee. -They don't sue. From the moment they lent him money, they granted him every privilege and every expediency. But this isn't because of Joseph Lee himself. Do you agree? -I just don't get it. -Right? That's what we're pursuing. What force had been backing him up? Who threw Joseph Lee into this deep abyss? Who's protecting him? THE BIG SHOT THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE NH BANK LOAN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE HOUSING DEPOSITS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF JOSEPH LEE When will you write the North York article? Next week, after we return. -Next week? -Yeah. So it will be out in two weeks. Yeah, I'll be focusing just on North York. Then you'll be able to see how NH Bank reacts. Yeah, I'm going to go and collect information as soon as we land. They'll probably keep quiet. They won't do anything. They've too much at stake not to. About two or three weeks before we came here, I had been working on a NIS-related article. You know, power abuse, corruption, stuff like that. There's a 100 percent possibility that they might sue me. After I'm sued and getting questioned, I'm like, man, I hate this, I'm in pain. This is the worst, but then I'm back to writing more articles that will get me sued. What am I doing? I don't have a lawsuit fetish... You know, like 'What is this? Who am I?' You know. THE BIG SHOT'S SON Everyone knows where Joseph Lee is. I just don't get why they're going out of their way to protect him. I heard the exact same plot, the exact same story. But what they said made me go, "This is for real." I didn't know if they would sit in front of a camera. But you have to call them out, whatever it takes at first. So concerning Joseph Lee, in Korea no criminal action has been taken against either Joseph Lee or Seok-bae Park. None. Why not? That makes no sense to me. They are currently in Washington right now, they'll visit in June. So just sue them. I told you, I'll spill all the beans if you do. That's the only way, if you want to get the Royal Bank of Canada anyway. Anyway, they keep lying about anything related to Joseph Lee. Man, those sons of bitches. DEEP THROAT A KEY NH BANK INSIDER SISA IN REPORTER JIN-WOO JOO The biggest fraud in the real estate history of Canada by Joseph Lee However, the business went... NH BANK I went to NH Bank around last June or July or something. It was really hot, I remember. But at that time, NH Bank took absolutely no action on the loss that happened in Canada. There was no attempt to make up for the losses or to pursue some kind of legal action. Someone committed fraud on them in Canada, they've lost this much money. But they're not even trying to get their money back. It's become taboo, of sorts. NH BANK CREDIT UNION So, who is this? He's the manager in charge. So basically, there was a Toronto loan case -and a financial accident occurred. -Okay. -But after this incident, -Yes. what measures did NH take to take care of this? The ones affiliated with this loan, Joseph Lee, for example, were handled according to measures given to us by the law firm, through the law firm. But why no investigations? If you pursued criminal action, they must be at Seoul Prosecutors' office, or at the police station? Criminal action... let me check. Let me know, please, just that. I just need to know that. When this case first started, I believe that it was started via outside pressure and was processed in a ridiculous way. This is a bank, the NH Bank! My father's been... by NH Bank, he, just thinking about this makes me so furious. If you work at a bank, I understand you may suffer losses. But in this ridiculous, inexplicable state, you can't even say that NH Bank was a victim of fraud. For this, seriously, NH Bank committed fraud. I've been after this case for four years. For four years. No legal action was taken. But now, I just heard that they've been sued, that some kind of action was indeed taken against them. I don't even need documents. Just send me a text. "We took such and such action in whatever month." Like this. -Will this be aired in Sisa IN? -Yes. -Yes, next week. -Next week. It won't be good. For you. A QUIET REVOLUTION NH Bank isn't suing them. I don't know. NH Bank isn't even thinking about suing them. They aren't. "It's all done and taken care of." "All done"? Who takes care of it like that? So NH Bank provides beneficiary right for RBC notes. If NH Bank really sued them, could Joseph Lee really be strutting about like that? He's in Korea! Seok-bae Park lives in Ssangyong Apartment, which number? Ssangyong Apartments, unit three, unit three... -Oh, it's that. -Oh, that one. So he was here until he emigrated to Canada? -No. -Then what's this house then? So they're saying he stayed here when he came to Seoul. But it's not clear if he actually did or if it's just a friend's house or whatever the heck it is. No one's home. Let's go. Who is it? Hello, excuse me. Does Seok-bae Park live here? -No. -Is Seok-bae Park not here? No, he isn't. -What about Joseph Lee? -He doesn't live here. -Is Joseph Lee here? -No. -Does Joseph Lee not live here? -No, What made you... -It's 2009, right? -Yeah. All right then. That person, her replies to me were consistent. So she isn't lying. She's not lying. -"Power cut, water supply cut"? What? -Seok-bae Park! Here he is. SEOK-BAE PARK WEST DISTRICT COURTS Over five days. So after that, yeah, July 15th. From July 11th. SEPTEMBER 6TH Which means that he didn't come by this house after July. It's just here, these cheeky things. These bastards are so naive. Not naive, this is just ridiculous. These bastards kept their office. These are studio apartments, so you can just buy it. -Right. -So they sold the others and kept this. We thought they would've sold this first and went somewhere else. -That's the logical... -But the thing is -the Korean authorities... -They won't arrest them. They won't arrest them. There's no reason for them to run, now that they think about it. But this is too much, no? Excuse me, sir. The apartment 1401. -Is it empty? -I don't know. -You don't know? -No, I don't. CTGK swindled so much money, tens of billions of won, tens of billions, but no financial institution... That's what I'm saying. They should've at least seized this place. Exactly. -They... -This is unbelievable. What did they say? -"They couldn't do anything about it"? -Insane. Those bastards. Oh my god. How did those bastards not take any measures to hide? They've ignored all processes even NH insiders call it "Privilege" They committed another huge fraud. They've committed so much fraud, it's not even funny. They give collateral, but the collateral disappears. The loan goes splat, there's no mortgage. I've never seen anything like it in my life. Suite 510. Where is it? How can I help you? I'm here about the North York Centrium loan case. As far as I know, NH Bank did collect all of their money back, that's what I heard. Did they not? Not a single cent. -They didn't? -Yeah. Did a NH Bank personnel come and only take pictures, then leave? Yes, they did. And as for collateral, they were holding onto it but they contacted us later, NH Bank contacted us and requested that we temporarily cancel the collateral. So we signed and canceled it, but they reinstated it. That's what I heard. Wait, but why did NH Bank ask for the collateral to be canceled? They didn't offer any explanations. If NH Bank had collateral, they gave them money in exchange for this collateral, right? Then why would they cancel? I think, what I had speculated was the RBC, there were goods we had bought at the RBC. And since there was something there that was around a similar amount to the collateral, so maybe they thought it was okay to cancel the collateral here. NH BANK CONTACTED THEM AND CANCELED THEIR COLLATERAL. But then later on, they were like, why did you cancel the collateral? So I asked them what the papers -were, the ones you sent before. -Okay. What was the name of the deputy head? Mr. Jin. MR. JIN, DEPARTMENT DEPUTY HEAD NH BANK FOREIGN INVESTMENTS THE COLLATERAL DISAPPEARED THEY CANCELED THE RIGHT TO COLLATERAL SECURITY ON 21 BILLION WON NH, I mean, how does that freaking make sense? What kind of company doles out all the money and then goes, cancel your mortgage? THE DEPUTY HEAD, MR. JIN ASKED FOR A MORTGAGE CANCELLATION Mr. Jin, this freaking bastard. JOSEPH LEE, RBC CANADA DEATH. -Are you calling him? -Yeah, it's worth a shot. The person you are trying to reach is unavailable. Please leave... He did tons of mortgage, collateral cases. He did tons. But this one, he got caught in my radar. He got caught. The deputy head, Mr. Jin, joined NH Bank as a contract worker in 2009 -The thing in handwriting at the bottom, -Yeah. that's our main objective. He won't receive his calls. He may not even be in Korea, yeah? I heard he goes back and forth between here and London. We're here to see a house in unit 612. I usually say I'm here to pick up someone but our car's packed, there is no space to pick up anything or anyone. So you're the realtor and we're your customers. You're so smooth. -What? -You're so smooth. Nah, it's just know-how, from doing it so much. This works overseas too. Mr. Jin's, there are only papers like... Back, back up. -Who is it? -This is where Mr. Jin lives, right? No. -Does Beep not live here? -Yes. Did he move? I don't know anything about who moved from here, Okay. but it's been a while. -A while? -Yes. Do you perhaps know around when he moved out? When did you move here? It's been like, eight months now. Eight months. -I see. The other tenant's moved? -Yes. So... not this person? No, his voice doesn't sound like him. Yeah? -Should I try calling him again? -Yeah. Rates will apply. He's not picking up. Pick up. Reject call, you know, something like reject calls. He's put that on my number. I'm calling him with another phone. He is taking calls from other numbers. Or he's on the phone with someone. Perhaps. Let's go. SISA IN THE DEPUTY HEAD, MR. JIN, JOINED NH BANK AS A CONTRACT WORKER IN 2009 HE HAS CAUSED HUGE LOSSES IN THE INDONESIA FULL VILLA LAND CASE AND IN THE APARTMENT HOUSING FUND IN CAMKO CITY, CAMBODIA BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO BE INTERVENING AND THE DAY JOSEPH LEE VISITED NH BANK FOR A LOAN When Joseph Lee went to NH Bank for the loan, there's someone he supposedly went with. -Have you heard? -Within NH Bank? No, he's the one who brought Joseph Lee over. He brought Joseph Lee? Yeah, to Foreign Investments, fourth floor. Fund Management, fourth floor, NH Building. I initially thought, is it Samsung? Because Samsung had visited. Seok-bae Park, he's the puppet president that Joseph Lee set up. Yeah, he took him there. Everyone went to see him, MB's relative. Everyone knows about that, there are so many witnesses. THE BIG SHOT They said H was here! Everyone went to see H, MB's relative. H = MB'S RELATIVE If that's the case, that makes a lot of sense. Right? That makes sense, if that is the truth. I didn't expect it'd be associated with Myung-bak Lee. If I had known that prior, we should've gotten more money. Who was H connected to in NH Bank? Who did they meet? It's not that they met one person, they met all the investors. They went to Investments. Then is there any way to find out who they met at Fund Management or meet up with anyone who met with them? Who they met up with? They met everyone. When they heard H was MB's relative, everyone flocked over. Okay, but out of the people who flocked over, can I... If you do meet up with one of them, you think the "Thousand-Year" people will let them be? Well, their faces will not be shown. I don't know. I don't want anyone I know to stand there. WHO DID THEY TRUST IN SO MUCH TO HAND OVER 21 BILLION WON? HAND OVER 21 BILLION WON OCTOBER 2013 ISSUE THE REASON WHY NH BANK WASTED 21 BILLION WON IN CANADA An associate of NH Bank President Myung-bak Lee SEOUL FINANCE SISA IN WHO DID THEY TRUST IN SO MUCH TO HAND OVER 21 BILLION WON? THE NAME OF A RELATIVE OF A POWERFUL MAN IN THE LEE GOVERNMENT HAS COME UP Mr. Joo. I read your article and it was very disappointing, the contents of it clearly indicated that you imagined the proceedings in a whole new way. It is totally unfounded and totally incorrect. I have no idea who said that but I'm curious too. If that was really the case, if that is true, I want to see this man. Do you not know H? -I don't. -You've never met him? If he's that famous, I would love to meet him one day. You were hired by NH Bank as an expert but you basically threw 21 billion won in the air. -Mr. Joo. -Yes. -I'm sorry. -Hello? MR. JIN, NH BANK FOREIGN INVESTMENTS This son of a bitch, the fucking bastard! Fuck. THE RESERVOIR In the past eight years, the total amount of money that was sent to tax havens is approximately 190 trillion won. Excluding Hong Kong, the money was sent to the Cayman Islands the most. In the first quarter of this year, Korea made a direct investment of 1,730,000,000 dollars. Or 2,010,600,000,000 won. If I sum up all Korean people living there, it'll be less than ten. The direct trade transactions between the Cayman Islands and Korea start growing exponentially from the year 2007. It doubles yearly. It coincides exactly with Myung-bak Lee's term in office. What did you mean by "all the addresses are like this"? This neighborhood, all the shell companies are in this neighborhood. Oh, this is a trust too. This is the most... -Oh, it's CNBC, the... -Right. Cayman Finance. This is it. It's around here. So this is all... Banks. The Royal Bank of Canada? Oh, Royal Bank House. What are you doing? It's the same initials though, RBC. Oh, it is! The RBC we've been looking for. It's huge. -Oh my, it really is! -Yeah. Wait, why is it so big? If the RBC building is as big as this here at the Cayman Islands, a building this big for a population of 55,000 people. I think we need to go incognito first and sweep out the place. So the money, transferred to Canada is now all here. The Royal Bank of Canada, Cayman Branch. Can you take a picture of me? Here, here. Look at this bastard. Look, the Cayman Islands Government Administration. If we go here... Shall we go inside and ask them? This is it. This is everything. -But a bank's bigger than this. -Seriously. A place where the banks are bigger than the government. SECRET BANK ACCOUNT Shall we take a look around the island? This is so-called "the Secret Fund Tour." This is MB Road. On this side, you can find all the accounting offices, law firms, banks, all the places perfect for hiding your money away. The road to the G20 conference was filled with challenges but led to unexpected meaningful results. Regulations will be tightened on the financial market, with tighter restrictions on hedge funds and tax havens... The fact that the developed countries were able to come to an agreement with the rising nations has a lot of historical significance... Such a beautiful place but all we've been talking about is Myung-bak Lee. JAIL MYUNG-BAK LEE Oh, RBC. RBC. Why are there so many? What if Myung-bak Lee bought everything RBC? It's not like Myung-bak is Mansour. -Seriously... -Don't underestimate the president. I've worked with MB for almost 10 years but received like, 1.8 million won. Do you know how much I spent? Anyway, the allowance I received from MB was a total of 1.8 million won. What a cheapskate. -You can found number companies. -Yeah. -You get numbers for them. -Okay. Joseph made a whole bunch of them. Can you tell us what kind of companies he founded exactly? That... I'm sorry. If my client agreed to it or if we were in court, I'd give you the information. -But I'm afraid I can't. -I see. Can you tell me the number companies? -The names? -Yes. Of course, the police and everyone who knows about it knows Thank you, that'd be great. That's all I need, I'll be out of your hair and on my way. I'll email it to you. Thank you. THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE NUMBER COMPANIES YOU REQUESTED. RESOURCE DIPLOMACY There was a scam, the biggest in Korea's history, called "Resource Diplomacy." The resource development industry that the MB government pushed for turned out to be a venture that could only result in losses. NATIONAL ASSEMBLY INVESTIGATION Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources reports that the price we paid for Harvest Operations was over a trillion won more expensive than its value. This is a dereliction of duty. It's a classic example of a nonsensical diplomacy caused by amateurism. "You're going to go buy coal." "We have to gain some results here, all right?" Then how would the other party react? Raise the prices exponentially, of course. Making a fool out of someone. At the time, foreign resource development, especially the M&amp;A processes were taken care of directly by the Blue House. If you look at the auditing report, Harvest from Canada, Dana Petroleum in the UK, Kazakh's Sumbe, Anchor, all of them have seen a decrease in profits and it points the losses are getting bigger and bigger. Do you know what the debt ratio is for Korea Resources Corporation? What is it? As of June, the first half of this year, it goes over 10,000 percent. If you take a look at the issues and doubts about President Lee, you'd think someone would have benefited from it but the losses are all on the KNOC or the KGC. That expression, perfect for a thief, is spot on. Out of the foreign resources development ventures, there are a few that are really problematic. -Okay. -As you know well, Harvest, NARL, El Boleo in Mexico, Ambatovy in Madagascar. These three cases are related to a Canadian company. All the big chunks are in Canada. All the money went to Canada and they signed M&amp;A's with Canadian companies. The contracts are signed and subsequent losses are thrust upon state-owned companies. Merrill Lynch advises the merger. It was revealed that the Merrill Lynch report was faked -and was totally false. -Right. The Canadian energy company, Harvest, which was bought by the KNOC with a hefty sum in 2009, turned out to be a hollow tree, causing controversy. We have obtained the advisory report Merrill Lynch had sent to KNOC before the merger, with inflated asset values. The report claimed that Harvest was estimated to be worth 3 trillion won, including estimates of drillable reserves and production. But Ryder Scott had a different opinion. They concluded that there was no economic value. Then, why isn't the KNOC saying to Merrill Lynch, "Your report got us into this mess and we suffered such and such losses," and suing them? We told them to sue at the time but they're unwilling. That's the first thing. They're unwilling, the KNOC. THE GOVERNMENT WAS UNWILLING TO CLAW BACK Secondly, the other problem is that in the service contract, there were a lot of loopholes for Merrill Lynch to pass through. Our authorities did not have the authority to investigate, so we had to ask Canada to help us, but starting from the inside, our financial authorities such as the FSS, if they performed a thorough investigation and found some kind of evidence which we can use as a basis to ask for the Canadian government's cooperation, I don't think it would be impossible to do. But they didn't bother. That's why we can't ask for help. THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO THOUGHTS OF SUING The biggest resource diplomacy happens in Canada. ALL BASED IN CANADA. The next important issue is they either buy or make a shell company or a bankrupt one. THEY MAKE A COMPANY THAT WILL GO BANKRUPT Then from NH Bank or the KRC, from somewhere, they throw in state funds. But when you go look, they're totally broke. Then they all run away. Some people try to look for them. Those people are found in reservoirs or are sued and accused or are cursed at and insulted. It just all points strangely to Canada. Then that's resource diplomacy? What about North York? It's the same thing. It's a very small case but it's very condensed. So that's the typical pattern? -Yes, it is. -The typical pattern. PATTERN -So, this is the typical pattern, anyhow. -Yes. For North York, now someone in Canada suddenly has a really great job. BASED IN CANADA So he makes a company. THEY SET UP A COMPANY THAT WILL GO BANKRUPT But even before it opens, NH Bank gives them a loan. THEY INVEST IN A COMPANY SET FOR BANKRUPTCY They get a loan, and then ruin the company. But they turn a blind eye, NH Bank turns a blind eye. THE GOVERNMENT IS UNWILLING TO RESTORE THE FUNDS NH BANK IS UNWILLING TO RESTORE THE FUNDS They should at least sue, right? But they do nothing. But now, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada starts investigating. NH Bank has never asked them to investigate. Ever. It's your case so we're interested. The police already know it all. So if NH Bank just gives a small nod, they'd be off. -Exactly. -Since it's already... Right, we may just find it all. But I've been dogging them around for years, asking why haven't they sued? They kept lying that they did but later, did they? Isn't FSS supposed to monitor and supervise NH Bank? You've been asking the FSS yourself, but they keep running away. Yeah, so they've sent over document for formality, like two pages. They say they're investigating, and they're inquiring but the related parties no longer work for the NH Bank so it's hard to proceed. That's how they concluded their investigation report and I felt that if this is how they treat normal issues, this is a bigger problem than I imagined. It's strange, there are so many traces in the Canadian bank, the Royal Bank of Canada but they make no effort to take criminal action under the Canadian law or start a civil case. They should at least show some kind of proof that they tried their best to claw back its losses, but they don't. It's mind-boggling. NH Bank did not pursue criminal action. Should I repeat exactly what you said then? Do you want me to publish it? Why does NH Bank do nothing but lie? We first need some kind of evidence that proves that we need to pursue criminal action or lawsuit, right? Right. -But the overall agreement was -Yes. that, just based on the information that our team has, it wouldn't be technically beneficial for the company -to pursue criminal action. -Okay. THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO INTENTIONS OF SUING NH BANK HAS NO INTENTIONS OF SUING Then we have to find it. But you can't. Not overseas. "Oh man, we need to catch that jerk!" "Why? He doesn't have the money." That's their justification for turning a blind eye. If you can make them sue, -that's the picture you're painting, yes? -Right. What will happen then? If you want to do it legally, you need to file it with the courts. Then you can trace it. -To sue effectively... -But we don't know the account. If there is a victim, the victim can go sue directly. So for someone to sue on someone's behalf, that doesn't work out here. I'll give you a piece of advice. The biggest difference between suing and not suing is if you sue, you can freeze all that money. -The court can freeze the money -Okay. -so no one can touch it. -Right. Then you win. They don't freeze it during the trial after you sue. There's something called the T.R.O in law. Temporary restraining order. When you sue, you request a TRO. Then after the judge goes through it and accepts your request, the funds will be immediately tied up. The problem is, that only works within the US. If the money you just spoke of is in another country, the US court laws cannot freeze that bank. It isn't in the US. It is somewhere, right? It has to be. It's in the Royal Bank of Canada. I saw it. And I think the North York trial is the easiest. The best thing about Canada is that it has no statute of limitations. You sue, and have the Royal Bank of Canada step up. Then that money is frozen. Then Myung-bak Lee is done for. If you sue, Myung-bak Lee's money is all frozen! Why not do it? The 20-something billion won from NH Bank? That's not even on the table. Do you know how much money is in that? Myung-bak will be ruined. In my opinion, I think that's the best revenge ever. If you sue that 21 billion branch, and then follow the flow from that branch it will lead to the reservoir... It will. Yes. NORTH YORK 21 BILLION WON NORTH YORK 21 BILLION WON CHUNG-HEE PARK, MYUNG-BAK LEE, DOO-HWAN CHUN, GEUN-HYE PARK That's way too fantastic. -It's way too simple. -Exactly. So the North York case... -Is no ordinary case. -It's a very important one. -Exactly! -Exactly. I've been chasing the National Assembly members, and the NH Bank staff to suggest suing them at least, but they can't. Because of this simple reason. You've said that you were the vanguard during the MB administration but now you say it wasn't your responsibility. Minister of Knowledge Economy, Kyoung-hwan Choi, the Deputy Prime Minister, you deny responsibility. Then who's to bear the burden for this resource diplomacy? President Lee? Are you going to answer? We will give you more time if needed. I've nothing to say because it's simply ludicrous. MINISTER OF STRATEGY AND FINANCE An assembly member's words are "ludicrous"? -It's ridiculous. -Ludicrous. -What the heck... -You cannot say such things. Excuse me. -Hey, hey! -Adjourn. -What the heck? -Adjourn! Why do you keep hindering the administration inspection? Why are you making one-sided arguments, why? -He didn't even answer yet! -Excuse me, -If you're going to... -the two of you, sirs... Why bother summoning them? Why have a witness if you're going to blabber by yourself? Let them leave and we can blabber among ourselves. Why bother? Adjourn already! Adjourn the session. They claimed ridiculous things. Seong-dong Kwon left the room. As you know well, Seong-dong Kwon used to work in the Blue House during the MB administration. A typical MB man. The majority party then had a very weak cause so they crippled the meeting by nitpicking at everything, like the chairman's words. So it's very unfortunate that we could not go into the crucial witnesses in depth. Now that the administration has changed, there's a limit to the national assembly inspection. This case has to be investigated by the judicial authorities. -Young-won Kang has been acquitted. -Okay. If there is no proof, there's nothing to work from. I'm sure the prosecution tried their best to investigate. Perhaps it was due to a lack of professionalism that this happened. If there is clear proof of doubt, we can start investigations but we cannot start anything just based on doubts. MINISTER OF JUSTICE THE FINAL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE You have used all your turns for mutual discussion. Candidate Geun-hye Park has the initiative for ten minutes. I would like to ask Mr. Myung-bak Lee this. You said that you decreased Seoul's debt by three trillion won, but it actually increased by 5.5 trillion won. You said that the SH Corporation has gained assets as well as debt, so that renders it to be not debt, but how can such accounting exist? Is it not debt until you work to pay it off? If SH Corporation cannot distribute all the apartments, the burden will naturally fall on the citizens of Seoul. Even if you may pay it all off, until it is paid it is debt. You say that I wouldn't know because I've never run a corporation but what kind of company does their accounting like this? Yes, this is a bit difficult to explain, indeed. If you trace that money, it leads to the president's money. So they can't. And they won't let you. That's why people die. And people around them all disappear. Not only that, but their methods are a bit violent and cruel. There really are people who die like that. It's all suicide. It's always suicide. So have you interviewed the man who committed suicide? One of the people who had been involved in this venture besides Mr. Jin was found in a reservoir. What do you mean, he was found in a reservoir? He was found dead. His wife says he had no reason to take his own life, none whatsoever. He went to work, just like any other person. Were you happy when he went to NH Bank? Well, after that was all decided he said he'll be going there. Did he leave any wills, anything written? There was nothing. Could we perhaps see a picture of him? We've never met him before. He came home, a bit drunk the night before but went to work like normal the next morning. But then was found in front of a reservoir. The police said it was suicide. No further investigations were made. You know Mr. Tae? He did similar duties as you in the team next to yours but he died. No, that's all unfounded. There was no pressure or anything like that. There were a lot of loan-related issues that happened that pushed people to their deaths. If you think about it, there was a lot of foreign project finance going on, and many of them didn't succeed since it was at the beginning. But the company did not raise issues with anyone or subject them to unfair treatment, so why would anyone be pressured and commit suicide? DEPUTY DEPARTMENT HEADS MR. JIN AND MR.TAE H brought Joseph Lee to the fourth floor at NH Bank. And soon after, Mr. Jin approved the loan for Joseph Lee. Mr. Jin was higher up, he was deputy department head so he was an executive. I don't know if he would've done the actual trade. I don't think they would've met Mr. Jin. But nothing's for sure. I was wondering if it was directly related to North York. H visited NH Bank around that time or H brought Joseph Lee there, stuff like that. Is there anyone else who heard of it? Any sources? CROSS CHECK I don't know. I really don't know that one. If I did, I would've found it first. -I would have found it first. -Yeah. I know what you're getting at. Even if you can't say it outright, if there were any rumors or... I know what you mean, but stuff like that doesn't just appear like, during investigation. The crucial evidence, the USB doesn't appear just like that. Rumors, just rumors. It just doesn't appear like that. If we had just one more piece of the puzzle, that'd be great. Hello. Did you have lunch yet? I'm eating now. Oh, okay, should I call you later? Sure. I'm a little busy right now. Why did you want to meet with me? Can you give me some names? I don't have any. I can't tell you. Forget it! He might be busy right now. -Hello? -Are you busy? -No. -Can you take a call? -What for? -This is nice. What are you saying? I told you what I can do and what I can't do since forever, but why do you keep asking for them? I'm pestering you because I like you. Is there anyone, any witnesses who can testify H came that day? Everything's there, but he won't dish on MB, Sang-deuk. Is there someone else in NH Bank? He went to the Investment department. He came. Did he really though? He probably just pressured them. Why come in person? He's the crown prince. The insiders will talk. If you hear anything, let me know. About that part... No one's talking about it. Yeah. You should hear it from the beginning, what do you mean? The story we want is in the latter half. Right, so I think we need to meet, get the files and hear what's going on again. No, I have to drop by the office today. Anyway, that's my report to you. Okay, please remember to save the file in a safe place. Some other person spilled the beans on NH Bank to Jin-woo. And they said they'll bring Mr. Jin next time. What the hell is this? In this day and age, you know? There's a limit to such things, but Myung-bak Lee did too much. Let's be real, if NH wasn't led by Won-byung Choi for four or five years NH Bank would've been Asia's leading bank. -Of course. -Right? Won-byung Choi and his North Gyeongsang posse. Right. The Thousand-Year Club. The Gyeongju kids. How do you know that? Oh, you know. Did you talk to Mr. Jin yesterday? Oh yeah, so he said there was a deal with good profits and the department head approved it without review. But we can't say that to the public, now, can we? So we say there was no fault with the loan, it was fraud. I'll look into it. But now that I think about it the Investments head was Mr. Seop. He's part of the Yeongpo Line. Then maybe that's also a possibility, a factor of this. The Yeongpo Line, Korea's mainstream used to be Daegu and North Gyeongsang, especially those in and from Daegu. After Myung-bak Lee became president the Daegu, North Gyeongsang, the Daegu people took control of all the power. The power group of the former administration also known as the Yeongpo Line is in the limelight again. The main focus of the doubts is that Yeongpo Line intervened behind the scenes of POSCO's faulty subsidiary M&amp;A. Won-byung Choi, a close associate of Myung-bak Lee, is elected president of NH Bank. President Won-byung Choi is former president Lee's high school junior. After he was elected president in 2007, he secured a second term in 2011. He is known to be quite close with powers of the MB administration. Won-byung Choi and Myung-bak Lee. The worshippers who followed them made the Thousand-Year Club, in hopes to never lose power for 1,000 years. It's like they will have NH Bank in the palm of their hands. The Yeongpo Line here became the focal point of this group. They were in control of all the money. The overseas financing projects, the ones that make the most money, they poured it out but got nothing back. They barely got their money's worth in one out of ten and lost everything. They did it all. They've succeeded. Even if it becomes an issue... Prosecutors say North Korea is behind NH's network shutdown. It's very similar to the March 4th DDoS attack. The shutdown started with a subcontractor's laptop becoming infected with North Korea's virus in the computer room. NH Bank said it was due to North Korea, but it is highly unlikely. All those who were on this case say so as well. What the experts are saying is that they probably internally shut down the system. So why did they have to do that? Why did they have to shut down the network? I'm curious about the reason why. That's one of the questions I have. I believe that this is related to this case. I just need to catch one loose end. Just one. So NH's small loan fraud case is a very important one. -The bank data -The bank data that was erased? that they say was erased by DDoS, and the bank that initiated that, there is a specific number of cases and people. They called in everyone who was in charge so a few people went in. They all said don't mention my name. The department head was Mr. Seop. He was part of the Yeongpo Line and I think he was affiliated with the Thousand-Year Club. All right, thank you. MANAGER SEOP YEONGPO LINE WHY PURSUE RELENTLESSLY, LIKE SO? I found Joseph Lee. I found his face. -Not his picture? -A video. Of his interview. -He did an interview? -Yeah. Who does he think he is? As the real estate market flow is such, the Korean community is rushing for quotes and consultations. Through our website JOSEPH LEE AN INVESTMENT COMPANY CEO and via phone calls, we have been receiving anywhere from 50 to 100 calls every day. JOSEPH LEE CENTRUST CEO Bye, come back safely. I'll see you in a bit. For the puzzle you're trying to figure out, I have some information that you might be interested in. But it seems irrelevant. Mr. Jin, did you bring Joseph Lee on your own? Yes, I'm 100 percent sure of that. Mr. Seop, he's in Yeongpo and... That's very unlikely. There was no gap for intervention. We should talk about Mr. Tae. I think Mr. Tae became a bit selfish. Self-serving. But a lot of people committed suicide at the time. For project finance, in the other banks too, so many people died even in our bank. I did hear that someone said, H told Mr. Seop and the others, to push this project forward with the Thousand-Year Club. And then the loan was approved. So in Toronto, Joseph Lee, the money disappeared and was transferred to the Cayman Islands. I thought they just did it because of the pressure from the top. They just approved of the loan because they had to. No, that's not possible. -Not possible? -Not possible. If something remotely similar happened, it'd be all online. Among all the hardships, do you know how hard I worked from 2008 to 2013 in order to make this business successful? In 2014, when I retired, I asked for a phone call to Seok-bae and received a call. I said, once I receive compensation I'll follow you to the ends of the earth and kill you. And then I hung up. You or the people who are here were punished but Joseph Lee is strutting about here and abroad, without any kind of restrictions. He's a hot potato. Too much time has passed and all the information's been leaked. They said let's sue, but... He's already a hot potato, and if this goes over to the prosecutors there will be tons of reporters there. And if this gets published, we'll be struck down before we know it. So we shushed it but after you published your article now, that's it. -Mr. Joo. -Yes? -I'm sorry. -Hello? -He won't spill. -He won't? He talks comfortably enough, he said he knew Joseph Lee well so he approved of the ridiculous loan just on its prospects. DEPUTY HEAD MR. JIN Mr. Tae is Mr. Seop's man. He is? They're distant relatives. So that's why the IV team, that's why Mr. Tae and Mr. Seop hastily put this Foreign Investments team together. And all the subsequent actions all fall into place. The puzzle's coming together. It does, yes, but Mr. Jin... -He slips out. -Yeah. Mr. Seop -was not experienced in investments, -Okay. he was just a secretary -and part of the Yeongpo Line. -Okay. But he suddenly makes this team. And when he does, he brings Mr. Tae into it. But Mr. Jin says he brought Joseph Lee here. Two outsiders, two professionals, Mr. Tae or Mr. Jin, these two came as expert foreign investors. -Okay. -But they blew six out of nine cases. So maybe this wasn't about profits or anything, it could've been something already planned that he went along with. At least, he admits to that. Are you following? The top dogs painted the picture about the loans and all that and they took the jobs and just let it play out. Anyway, Mr. Seop is associated -with H and the others -Yeah. and the Thousand-Year Club, Yeongpo Line, -that's all happening -Yeah. but he claims he did his duty. If he knew all this, he's lying. I don't buy it. He was like It's nine different projects they worked on, -but this is all weird. -Okay. -All weird. -Yeah. He was a talented worker, a very good worker, but he said that it's weird that he'd just suddenly die. It's all weird and strange, but he didn't slack on his job. Just his. Frick. This is hard. So he's not affiliated with the Thousand-Year Club... Let's go. Bye. So what they told me was you just want to drag me in and use me. Is that what this is? Don't trust Korean reporters... I'm moving to the US. What I want to tell you, Joo, hello, are you mad at me now? Why would I be mad? But all Koreans are like that, the opposition party too, it's all greed and how it can be more beneficial for themselves and for their side. They calculate this and that but time flies by. There are so many things about Korea I don't get. I told you, why can't they claw back the disbursed money? I bet we're the only country who can't do it. You're an accomplice too, you know. What? Why am I? You said you wanted to and you tried looking for his secret funds? Then why don't you go looking when you know you can? -How can I find it? -Why can't you? I said you have to sue! Yeah, so I'll sue! Use me! I don't want to get involved. I don't want to be in this shitshow that is Korea anymore. Just help me out. One statement and I'll take care of everything. A top executive at NIS said there was someone with an important source. He introduced me to him, saying he might be the man I was looking for. Since he saw firsthand the actual truth behind all this. But he won't say. DEEP THROAT I'm thankful he told me this much, but it's still a bit lacking. If he took one small step, I'll bear the responsibility. I'll be there when the bomb drops or whatever explodes. But he doesn't want to get involved. I get it. I really do. The nation watched gravely as President Geun-hye Park gave her second apology on the Soon-sil Choi scandal. Thinking of how difficult it will be to mend the heart of the people rips me apart, as shame makes me think, Is this why I became the president? NOVEMBER 4TH, 2016 NOVEMBER 21ST, 2016 -It's a nice day. -Right? -Hello. -Hello. Why are you moving so quickly all of a sudden? He said he'll make the president. Jin-woo. It's been a long time. Are you getting it? It's a nice day today. It was really cold a few days ago. At the front. President Young-sam. Mr. President, a word about the current state of affairs please. Where are you from? What's your affiliation? I'm Jin-woo Joo, a reporter for Sisa IN. -But you're not here on behalf of them? -No, sir. The current state... Hold on, hold on. Don't be like this. He'll say a few words, so get in formation. I honestly feel the same way. I'm devastated. How could such an embarrassing, shameful thing happen? Our citizens, really, the ones at the protests... You said you felt the same as the country, -but they're asking for her to step down. -Let's move on. We're moving on. Excuse me, out of the way. No more questions. Stop it. Use your common sense, that's not something you ask the president. You said you'll raise a president with your own hands in September, I was curious as to what made you say such a thing. -That... -That kind of... Move away now. Everyone, we all want the country do to well, no? What was our country built on? We've overcome every obstacle into present day. We must overcome this as well and move forward. Thank you all for coming. -Thank you. -Thank you for coming. -Thank you, sir. -Thank you. You were on H's trail a few years back with Jin-woo, a crucial factor of the North York case? We would find out his regular restaurant and sit there for hours. We dropped by his office unannounced. But wherever we'd go or reserve, wherever we'd follow him to, he always knew. Let me have a smoke. -Man. -Just smoke it, just smoke it. I can finish anything in five minutes, man. One time, we knew he was going to be at this restaurant. So we went there an hour before. But he never showed. We were going to just eat and stop by his table, right? Just stop by and talk a bit. But he never showed up. Concerning money, there was no such person, since the beginning of Korea, who would use his public status to milk out money to this proportion, and this secretively. Not now, not ever. But the thing is, there's no smoking gun. You think you're getting close, but it disappears. I don't think you can find which account and how much money it holds. I don't think you can confirm or uncover evidence. After the past few years, I realized it was impossible. The moment you think you see a trail, it's cold. It's not something you can do as an individual. So even if you become tired and give up, someone else might have to continue it. Honestly, the country, the government should be doing it. So until they do, we're just trying it out. I've felt a lot of threats for my life until the last election. But if I made a movie like this, maybe they'll try to kill me less? -They'll kill you more. -No, less! THE PURSUIT FAILED. JIN-WOO'S INFERENCES AND JUDGMENTS WERE NOT PROVEN. YET. To be honest, there are parts to this that hurt my brain just thinking about it. We've never seen anything quite like it. This is really awkward to express in words. Yes. Got it, yeah. Yeah. Pardon? -Since it was a bit, you know... -Yes. -But I've always wanted to talk to you. -Okay. I wanted to call you as well. I can't tell you in detail, like this... Do you have a Telegram, sir? Do you have an iPhone? I do use an iPhone, but I'd prefer not to contact you in that way. I was just asking because I was worried. Yes, a lot of people have died around me as well. Even those who've been in this field of work. -Even if it's legal. -Yeah. Gold, we say the gold funds I've been getting offers for disposing of all their gold. In Korea? I did hear that MB's people hoarded a lot of gold and were trying to dispose of it... That's exactly right. They all know. The whole world knows. Is that right? Gold doesn't move around easily. They don't transport it because it's dangerous. Right, right. So MB or Park... Right, so either someone used it and MB ate it up or it's totally irrelevant to Choi, but it's been active -since the Park administration began. -Right. So in London, MB, with the help of Geun-hye Park, put out gold for sale. -Yes. That's correct. -I've heard that. Because of current circumstances, that's not even the issue, the people say that Lee's been just fucking around... Who was fucking around? Past administration, MB. Right. Oh man. MB is one crazy bastard. Yes. But Mr. Joo, I'll say one thing. You have to do this properly. Not just me, but all the things you're doing now, you're doing truly a remarkable thing. Yes, I'm doing my best. If you don't get it done this time, we're all dead. I know. I know. Thanks to people like you, I am encouraged to work harder. Yes, I'm doing it now. When shall I call you? Okay. I'll do it. I'll do it. Yes, thank you. Yes. Yes. Jin-woo. This is the last shoot, in my heart anyway. -Really? -For a year and a month... It's the final shoot in my heart. Then it's not the end. I've been meeting up with Young-tae Ko every day recently. He's so nervous, he asks every night, "This isn't the end, right? This isn't the last time?" Why do you pursue this so relentlessly? You can't turn your face from corruption. You can't see what these hoodlums are doing and just walk the other way. I don't think about justice or values. I have no spirit of a journalist. Then why do all this? But this is, they're messing up Korea. We need to stop that. Aren't you tired? Me? Of course. -Jin-woo Joo gets tired? -Of course. I'm a nobody, but there are articles about me, people criticizing me, people around me, I can see them spying and tagging along around my people. Two days ago, my wife, some car tried to run her over on a hill. She was just walking on the sidewalk, and this car... Why Lee and Park? -Yeah. -They broke down -justice, law, and democracy. -Okay. With money and status, they numbed and polluted everyone. So we have to get them, the root of all evil. And by doing so I want to say that those who commit a crime will be punished. Even if I can't catch them, I want to be there, breathing down their necks. Have a safe trip, be safe. I'll see you when you get back. Thank you for your work. Have a safe trip! -I'll see you later. -See you later. Goodbye. TEN YEARS AGO It is time for your final statement. To the people, to your party members, this is the time to add in what you haven't said yet or reiterate your words. Candidate Geun-hye Park, please. The seat of the president is a very lonely and difficult place. I grew up watching it. If I wanted to live comfortably, I wouldn't have dreamed of becoming president. I have no children, I have no family of my own. What more greed would I have left? My dream is only this. To give hope to our citizens who are having hardships and to make our country a developed nation. I, Geun-hye Park, will change the administration and give back hope to the people of Korea. Now, candidate Myung-bak Lee. "The problem is the economy." The people resonated with this sentence Clinton was elected, and he saved the US economy. I do not wish to become the most powerful man. I wish to become the chief executive officer to save this country. Thank you.
