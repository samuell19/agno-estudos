My name is known, God and King. I am most in majesty, in whom no beginning may be and no end. Highest in potency I am, and have been ever. I have made stars and planets in their courses to go. I have made a moon for the night, and a sun to light the day, also. I have made earth, where trees and grasses spring. Beasts and fowl, both great and small, all thrive and have my liking. I have made all of nothing for man's sustentation. And of this pleasant garden that I have mostly goodly planted, I will make him gardener for his own re-creation. Back it out of there! Come on! Back that up! Will you back it up? Come on. What do you say? I got the right of way. Look at that character. Hey, come on. I got the right of way! Go on! Get out of here! Don't just stand there.

Here, see if it fits. Who is it? I said noon. Come here, come here! Oh, boy, look! Here, see if it fits. Now, do not suppose that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets. I did not come to abolish, but to complete. I tell you this. So long as heaven and earth endure... not a letter, not a stroke will disappear from the law until all that must happen has happened. Any man that sets aside even the least of the law's demands, he will have the lowest place in the kingdom of heaven. But he who keeps the law, and teaches others so... Yeah? Come on. ...he will have the highest place in the kingdom of heaven. Unless you show yourselves to be far better than the Pharisees, and the doctors of the law, you shall never enter the kingdom of heaven. Amen! Brothers and sisters, gather round, because two men, I said two, went off to the temple to pray. One, a Pharisee. And the other, a tax gatherer. - Shame! - Why, the Pharisee, he just stood right on up and prayed thus... I thank thee, O God, that I am not like other men. - Greedy! - Yeah! - Dishonest! - Yeah! - Adulterous! - Yeah! Or, for that matter, like that tax gatherer. I pray twice a week. Get that? Twice a week. And pay taxes on all that I get. Zip-a-dee-doo! But the other kept his distance and would not even raise his eyes to the good Lord in heaven. - I said the good Lord in heaven, child. - Amen! But beat upon his breast, saying... O God, have mercy on me, sinner that I am. And it was this man, I tell you... What? You've got to be kidding. ...and not the other, who went off and quitted of his sins. For every man who exalts himself... ...shall be humbled. But every man who humbles himself... Yeah? Shall be exalted! Now, what if your brother sues you? You'd better settle with him quickly. - Otherwise, he'll hand you over to the judge. - Guilty! And the judge to the constable. - And you'll land in jail. - Creak! Let me out of here! And I tell you, you'll not get out of there until you've paid the last penny. ♪ There once was a king ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Who decided to settle Accounts with the men who served him ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Well, at the outset, there appeared Before the master ♪ - ♪ A man whose debt ran into the millions ♪ - ♪ What? ♪ - ♪ I said the millions ♪ - ♪ Whoa! ♪ ♪ But the man had no means of paying the money ♪ ♪ The master ordered him to be sold to meet the debt with his wife ♪ - ♪ Whoa! - ♪ And his child ♪ - ♪ Whoa! ♪ - ♪ And everything he had ♪ ♪ Well, the man threw himself down at the master's feet and went ♪ ♪ Ooh-bobadoo, uh! ♪ Oh, be patient with me.

Yay, master! Wait a minute. But no sooner had the man been released than he met a fellow servant who owed him a few dollars. Well, he gripped him by the throat and said... Pay me! I says, pay me what you owes me. Whoa! The man fell at his fellow servant's feet and begged him, saying... Please, please, be patient with me. I shall pay you. But he refused, saying... - Look! - What? And had him jailed until he should pay the debt. Well, the other servants were deeply distressed when they saw what had happened. Are you sitting down? They ran and told their master the whole story. Mmm-hmm. Accordingly, he sent for the man. - You scoundrel! - He said to him. I remitted the whole of your debt when you appealed to me. Were you not bound to show your fellow servant the same pity I showed to you? And so angry was the master that he condemned the man to torture until he could pay the debt in full. Oh, no, no, no. And that is how my heavenly father will deal with you, unless you forgive your brothers from your hearts.

But what I tell you is this. Never set yourself against the man who wrongs you. So if someone slaps you on your right cheek, turn and offer him your left. Oh, Jesus Chr-- Slowly I turn, step by step, inch by inch. You... Hello? It's for you. No, I, uh, didn't think so. Aw! Now, when the Son of Man comes in all his glory, with all his angels with him, he will sit in state upon his throne, with all the nations gathered before him. And then he will separate the men into two groups, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And then he'll put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. Over there. Sheep on his right. Oh, oh! The sheep on his right. Oh, I see. Thank you. And then he will say to those on his right, sheep, you have my father's blessing. Oh, wonderful. Come and enter the kingdom that has been ready since the world was made. For when I was hungry, you gave me food. - When I was thirsty, you gave me drink. - Oh, it's nothing. When I was naked and without a home, you took me to your house. And when I was ill and in prison, you came to my aid. Ah-ah. Sorry. No goats. Baloney! And then they will say to him... Oh, Master, when was it that we saw you hungry and gave you food, or thirsty and gave you drink? Yeah. Or in prison and helped you? And he will say to them, anything you did for one of your brothers, however humble, you did for me. Oh, I get it. And he will say to them, a curse is upon you. Then they will say to him... Big boy, if we'd have known it was you, we would have taken you around the corner for a cup of coffee. And he will say to them, anything you did not do for one of your brothers, however humble, you did not do for me. And then they will take their place in eternal punishment, but the righteous shall have eternal life. Come on! Come on. The lamp of the body is the eye. If your eye is sound, your whole body will be filled with light. But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be darkness. If then the only light you have is darkness... the darkness will be doubly dark. Hey, I can't see! - Why not? - What's the matter? I got my eyes shut. Now, no servant can be the slave of two masters. Either he will love the first and think nothing of the second, or be devoted to the second and hate the first. No man can serve God... What? ...and money.

A man was on his way from Jerusalem to Jericho. When he fell among robbers, who beat him, stripped him, and left, leaving him half dead. It so happened a priest came upon him, but when he saw him, he went past on the other side. So, too, a judge came to the place... ...and saw him, and he went past on the other side. But a Samaritan was making the journey. He came upon him, and when he saw him, he was moved to pity. He went up and bandaged his wounds... bathing them in oil and wine. Then he put him onto his own beast and brought him to an inn and looked after him there. The next day, he produced two pieces of silver and gave them to the innkeeper and said, "Look after him, and if you spend any more, "I will repay on my way back." No! No! When you do some act of charity, don't announce it with a flourish of trumpets, as the heathen do in the synagogues and in the streets. I tell you, they do it just to win admiration from men. No, when you do some act of charity, don't let your right hand know what your left hand is doing. Oh, look at that! Your good deed must be in secret. It's a secret. Now, what the good master's telling us all right now is that up in heaven, there's about a hundred million little tiny angels, about yea by yea, and they all take shorthand. And every time you do something silly, they write it in a-- No, no, no, no. That's not what the good master's telling us. Your heavenly father, who sees what is done in secret... He will what? Reward you! Get him some flowers. Thank you. Thank you. There once-- There once was a very rich man who-- Thank you. Who dressed in purple and the finest linen. Rich man, that's me. And every day, he feasted... Thank you. Thank you. Ah, feasted in the greatest magnificence. At his gate, there lay a poor man named Lazarus, who would have been glad to have satisfied his hunger with the scraps from the rich man's table. Oh, my God, it's good. Get out of there. Now, even the doggy-doggies used to come to Lazarus and lick his open, running sores. - Bleck. - Sorry. Well, one day, the poor man died. And he was carried away by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died. And was buried. And was sent to Hades. - Hello. - Hello. Hey. Where he was in torment. He looked up, and there, far, far away was Abraham, with Lazarus close beside him. Oh, Father Abraham, have pity on me. Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water to cool my tongue. For I am in agony in this fire. Let go of me, will you? Remember, my child, that all the good things fell to you while you were on earth - and all the bad to Lois. - Lazarus. Abraham. Glad to know you. And now it is he who has consolation here and it is you who are in agony. But, Father Abraham, send Lazarus to my father's house, where I have five pies, I mean, brothers, to warn them so that they, too, may not come to this place of torment. They've got Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them. Yeah, but if somebody from the dead should rise, then they would listen.

And as he sowed, some seed fell on the footpath. Where it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. Some seed fell on rock. And after coming up... Grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow. Oh! Oh! Withered for lack of moisture. Oh! Oh! Oh, my! And some seed fell in among the weeds. And the weeds grew up with it and choked it. And some seed fell into good soil. Good soil! Come on! Where it grew and it yielded a hundredfold. Do you know what the seed is? A baby. Wrong. The seed is the word of God. And that seed, which fell along the footpath, represents those who hear the word. But then the devil comes and carries them off, for fear they should believe and be saved. And that which fell upon rock, they receive the word with joy when they first hear it, but they have no root, and so in time of testing, they desert. - Bye. - See you. And that which fell in the weeds, they hear the word, but their further growth is impaired by wealth and cares and the pleasures of the world. They bring nothing to fruit. No fruit, Robin! But that which fell among good soil... Hey, good soil! Good soil. They hear the word with a good and honest heart, and, through their perseverance, yield a harvest. Come on.

And the younger son said to his father... Father, give me my share of the property. So, he divided his estate between them. A few days later, the younger son turned the whole of his share into cash. And left home for a distant country. Where I squandered the money on reckless living. He had spent it all when a severe famine fell upon the country and he began to feel the pinch. So he decided to attach himself to one of the local landowners, who sent him on the farm to mind the pigs. He would have been glad to have filled his belly with the pods the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. And then he came to his senses. He said... How many of my father's paid servants have more food than they can eat? And here I am starving to death! I will set off and I will go to my father's house and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against God and against you! I am no longer fit to be called your son! Treat me as one of your paid servants!" So he set out for his father's house. Yes, and there he goes. While he was still a long way off, his father saw him. Mmm... Ah! And his heart went out to him. The son ran to meet his father, and, like the spunky kid he is, threw his arms around him, kissed him and said... Father, I have sinned against God and against you. I am no longer fit to be called your son. Treat me as one of your paid servants. But the father called to one of his servants. Sooey! Quick, fetch me my robe, my best one. Put rings on his fingers and bells on his toes, so he shall have music wherever he goes. What? Wrong story. Put rings on his fingers and shoes on his feet. And bring the fatted calf and kill it. I said kill it. I said kill it! And let us have a feast to celebrate this here day, for this son of mine was lost... and is found. Was dead and has come back to life. And the festivities began. Now, the oldest kid was out on the farm, working. On his way back, as he approached the house, he heard music and dancing. He called on one of his servants and asked him what it meant. The servant said... You know, your brother, yeah, your brother's come back home again. Your father's killed the fatted calf 'cause he got him back safe and sound. Well, the brother was rather irritated by this. He refused to go into the house. The father came out and pleaded with him. But he retorted, saying... You know how I've worked for you all these years. And you never gave me so much as a kid for a feast with my friends. But once this son of yours turns up, after running through your money with his women, you kill the fatted calf for him. I said kill it! I said kill it! Yahoo, yippity. My boy, said the father, you've always been with me and everything I have is yours. Now, how could we help but celebrate on this happy day? For... For your brother here was dead and has come back to life, metaphorically speaking. Was lost and is found. Them's my boys. - Hey! - Hey! Is there a man among you who would offer his son a stone when he asks for bread? Is there a man among you who would offer his son a stone when he asks for bread? - A snake if he asks for fish? - No! Well, if you then, bad as you are, now know how to give your children what is good for them, how much more will your heavenly father give good things... Good things, good things, good things, good things, yeah! ...to those who ask for them? Always treat others as you would have them treat you. Yeah, yeah, yeah! Well, that is the law and the prophets.

But if we say from men, the people will be angry for they took John as a prophet. We do not know. Then neither will I tell you by whose authority I act. Stop! Now, we know you are an honest man.

Thou shalt love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul. This is the greatest commandment of them all, and the second is like it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. All the rest of the law and all that the prophets have written is based on these first two. You doctors of the law and you Pharisees sit in the chair of Moses. But you say one thing and you do another. Everything you do is done for show. Oh, you like to have your places of honor at feasts and in the synagogues, and to be greeted respectfully and to be called Teacher. But you must not be called Teacher for you have one teacher, the Messiah. And you must not call any man on earth Father, for you have one father, and you are all brothers. ♪ Alas, alas, for you lawyers and Pharisees ♪ ♪ Hypocrites that you be ♪ ♪ Searching for souls and fools to forsake them ♪ ♪ You travel the land, you scour the sea ♪ ♪ Then when you've got your converts, you make them ♪ ♪ Twice as fit for hell as you are yourselves ♪ ♪ Alas, alas, for you lawyers and Pharisees ♪ ♪ Hypocrites that you are ♪ ♪ Sure that the kingdom of heaven awaits you ♪ ♪ You will not venture half so far ♪ ♪ Other men who might enter the gates, you keep from passing through ♪ ♪ Drag them down with you ♪ ♪ You snake, you viper's brood ♪ ♪ You cannot escape being devil's food ♪ ♪ I send you prophets and I send you preachers ♪ ♪ Sages in rages and ages of teachers ♪ ♪ Nothing can mar your mood ♪ ♪ Blind guides ♪ ♪ Blind fools ♪ ♪ The blood you've spilt on you will fall ♪ ♪ This nation, this generation ♪ ♪ Will bear the guilt of it all ♪ ♪ Alas, alas, alas for you ♪♪ Blind fools!

Come on. - Okay, come on. - Come here. Well, sit next to me. Hey, that's you! I tell you this, one of you among us will betray me. - Could it be me, Lord? - Could it be me, Lord? - How about me, Lord? - Could it be me, Lord? How about me, Lord? - Could it be me, Lord? - Could it be me, Lord? Could it be me, Lord? Rabbi, can you mean me? The words are yours. Do quickly what you have to do. Take this and eat, eat, for this is my body. Take this and drink, for this is my blood. The blood of the covenant shed for the forgiveness of sins. And I tell you, I shall never again drink from the fruit of the vine until I drink it again with you in the kingdom of my father. ♪ On the willows there ♪ ♪ We hung up our lives ♪ ♪ For our captors there ♪ ♪ Required ♪ ♪ Of us songs ♪ ♪ And our tormentors ♪ ♪ Mirth ♪ ♪ On the willows there ♪ ♪ We hung up our lives ♪ ♪ For our captors there ♪ ♪ ♪ Required ♪ ♪ Of us songs ♪ ♪ And our tormentors ♪ ♪ Mirth ♪ ♪ Saying, sing us one ♪ ♪ Of the songs of Zion ♪ ♪ Sing us one ♪ ♪ Of the songs of Zion ♪ ♪ Sing us one ♪ ♪ Of the songs of Zion ♪ ♪ But how can we sing ♪ ♪ Sing the Lord's song ♪ ♪ In a foreign land? ♪ Stay here while I go over there to pray.

Yet not as I will, but as thou wilt. What? Could none of you stay awake with me one hour? Stay awake and be spared the test! The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. Everyone else may fall away on your account, but I never will. I tell you this! Tonight before the cock crows you will betray me three times. Father, if it be not possible for this cup to pass me by without my drinking from it, thy will be done. If you are the son of God, turn this stone into bread! Man does not live by bread alone. He lives on every word that God utters. If you are the son of God, throw yourself down. The scriptures say he will send his angels to support you. Thou shall not tempt the Lord your God. All these things I will give you, if you will pay me homage. The son of... Begone, Satan! You shall do homage to the Lord your God and worship him alone. Friend, do quickly what you have to do. Put down the sword! He who lives by the sword dies by the sword. Do you not suppose that I could appeal to my heavenly father, who would at once send to me 12 legions of angels? Do you take me for a bandit that you come after me with swords and cudgels? Day after day I sat teaching in the synagogue and you didn't come after me then. But all this has happened to fulfill what the prophets have written. ♪ Oh, God ♪ ♪ I'm bleeding ♪ ♪ Oh, God ♪ ♪ I'm bleeding ♪ ♪ Oh, God ♪ ♪ You're bleeding ♪ ♪ Oh, God ♪ ♪ I'm dying ♪ ♪ Oh, God ♪ ♪ You're dying ♪ ♪ Oh, God ♪ ♪ I'm dying ♪ ♪ Oh, God ♪ ♪ I'm dead ♪ ♪ Oh, God ♪ ♪ You're dead ♪ ♪ Oh, God ♪ ♪ You're dead ♪ ♪ Oh, God ♪ ♪ You're dead ♪♪ ♪ Long live God ♪ ♪ Long live God ♪ ♪ Long live God ♪ ♪ Long live God ♪ ♪ Long live God ♪ ♪ Long live God ♪ ♪ Long live God ♪ ♪ Long live God ♪ ♪ Long live God ♪ ♪ Long live God ♪ ♪ Long live God ♪ ♪ Long live God ♪ ♪ Prepare ye Long live God ♪ ♪ The way of the Lord Long live God ♪ ♪ Prepare ye Long live God ♪ ♪ The way of the Lord Long live God ♪ ♪ Prepare ye Long live God ♪ ♪ The way of the Lord Long live God ♪ ♪ Prepare ye Long live God ♪ ♪ The way of the Lord Long live God ♪ Everybody now! ♪ Prepare ye the way of the Lord ♪ ♪ Prepare ye the way of the Lord ♪ ♪ Day by day ♪ ♪ Day by day ♪ ♪ Oh, dear Lord, three things I pray ♪ ♪ To see thee more clearly ♪ ♪ Love thee more dearly ♪ ♪ Follow thee more nearly ♪ ♪ Day by day ♪ ♪ Day by day Day by day ♪ ♪ Day by day Day by day ♪ ♪ Oh, dear Lord, three things I pray ♪ ♪ Three things I pray ♪ ♪ To see thee more clearly Day by day ♪ ♪ Love thee more dearly Day by day ♪ ♪ Follow thee more nearly ♪ ♪ Day by day Day by day ♪ ♪ Day by day Day by day ♪ ♪ Oh, dear Lord three things I pray Three things I pray ♪ ♪ To see thee more clearly Day by day ♪ ♪ Love thee more dearly Day by day ♪ ♪ Follow thee more nearly ♪ ♪ Day by day Day by day ♪ ♪ Day by day Day by day ♪ ♪ Day by day ♪ ♪ Oh, dear Lord, three things I pray ♪ ♪ To see thee more clearly Day by day ♪ ♪ Love thee more dearly Day by day ♪ ♪ Follow thee more nearly ♪ ♪ Day by day ♪ ♪ Day by day Day by day ♪ ♪ Day by day Day by day ♪ ♪ Day by day Day by day ♪ ♪ Day by day Day by day ♪ ♪ Day by day Day by day ♪ ♪ Day by day ♪♪
