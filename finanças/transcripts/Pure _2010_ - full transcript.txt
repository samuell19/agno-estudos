We don't have all the time in the world. You shouldn't waste life so the only thing that happens is that your pussy gets slack. The first time I heard Mozart was on YouTube. That was nearly a year ago. I was searching for some stupid clip, and suddenly I was captivated. By the music. Since then, they can't touch me. They can take their cocks and their ugly lives and say what they want. I don't care. I'm not there anymore. In some bloody way I'll escape all this and get to the other side. To where it's more real than this dreadful reality. To where it's... ...beautiful. PURE 318.50, please. I've only got 300. I'm sorry, but... You have to put something back. Then it's 292. Thanks a lot. And 8 kroner change. Would you like the receipt? Here you are. Have a nice day. Bye. Hang on to Mattias. He's a good guy. If you hadn't met him, I don't know where you'd have ended up. You're lucky you're good-looking. Later on they don't want you. Try to be more sociable so people want to hang out with you. You could dye your hair blonde. Hi. Hi. Nille couldn't believe we're going to Mozart. You didn't have to go with me. I do. We never do stuff together. A car like that. The red one. The convertible. We'll get a car like that. Slut! Slut! Slut! That's enough. Have you lost your mind? Katarina, I had hoped that we wouldn't have to meet again. But then you knock down a boy at your work. You're 20 years old. I screwed some guys a while back. Their brothers attend the school. I hate the Internet. Why the hell are you giving me that look? Katarina. I've stopped. I don't suck cock anymore. I'm no longer on Facebook. I want it pure. I'm sorry to have to say this, but you've lost me completely. Shit, mum. Hi, sweetie. Mum, come outside. I'm just having a beer. I need to talk to you. Now. All right. What the fuck is this? Lena's kid goes to the school. She said you acted like a lunatic. So I thought you might also need some sedatives. So I called the doctor I use. I was also thinking of Mattias. So you can still live with him. I sure as hell can't live with you. No. Okay. Your emotions are a bit too strong. Katarina, wait! You have to try to act normal. Everybody's talking. What am I to say to Lena? I'll never become like you. If I do, I'll kill myself. Stop. Henric, you set off the triplet descent down towards the bass. You lead the woodwind. More clarity in attack, more clarity in address. What are you expressing? It's a beautiful intermezzo. As if it dawned on Beethoven that he was writing a different symphony. And another thing. It's still a bit too slow. You're here for the interview? Are you here for the interview? Yes. Did you bring any papers? I don't care about grades, but I need to see your CV. May I use the toilet, please? End of the corridor, to your right. Hello again. My mother played. The piano. I see. She was a concert pianist? Yes. That's right. Where did she play? In Australia. Her name was Kelly Clarkson. Kelly Clarkson? The name sounds familiar. She was actually very talented. But then she died. Cancer. Right before her big breakthrough. And I was only two years old. I was here to hear Mozart's requiem. Some time ago. It almost felt like... like I was coming home. I've got a daughter your age. I've been playing Mozart's requiem for her since she was a baby. But she only likes that guy... Snoop... Dogg, or something like that. Do you know him? I hate him. Christ! It's not music. It's more of a striptease show. I just don't get it. We always have a trial period. A group of us decides whether it'll be made permanent. There's not much to it, really. You just blend into the house. Behave professionally and don't make any enemies. I'm off. Are you wearing that? Yes. Can you wear your normal clothes? I think so. Wait. What? So you can take notes. And a pen. Thanks. Wear this. You all wear one of these. And then a name tag. Put it there. If you need pen and paper, it's right there. If you can find it. Been ages since anyone tidied up here. The printer is here. There's the feeder. Let's move on. On that monitor you can see what's going on in the concert hall. If you want to hear what they're up to, you push this button. Let me show you how you answer a call. When it rings, this window pops up. Click on it. The Concert Hall, Katarina. I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you it acts up like that sometimes. Simply turn it off. When you turn it on again in a minute, it'll be fine. Come in. Post. Great. Put it on the table. Turn off the speaker, please. Just turn the switch. By the way, has the coffee vendor been mended? Coffee... I didn't have a cup this morning. My son's in an independent phase. This morning he tried making coffee. Hi. It all ended up on the floor. Katarina, right? Do you like it here? It's a trial period. I think you'll stay on. "Courage is life's only measure." Who said that? Kierkegaard, I think. What does it mean? You can do everything, if you dare. If you don't go mad trying. I'm sure you won't go mad. Really? How do you know? You don't look the part. How do you know? I know the type. Well, I have to get back to work. Did you have a good day? Yes. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Tell you what. Nille and Cissi are having a baby. All right. Nille came by work today with a photo from the ultrasound scan. It was so tiny, but you could see it was a person. It had Nille's nose. A long, little... Any ketchup left? Yes. Thanks. How did it go at the penguin factory? Any news? I told you it went well. Your mum's called. It would be nice if you talked to her. I don't think she's well. She's your mother, after all. I don't understand the end of The Jungle Book. Why did Mowgli have to leave his friends? I didn't care. You're the one who cried. I'm off. Shit. Good morning. Good morning. Oh, I've got something for you. Here. Gunnar Ekelof. Do you know him? I think you'll like it. Read it. Tell me what you think. Thanks. Stop. I'm not being paid to nag you, but please, one more time! Come on, now. I'm not giving in. I know you can do it. Prefect Henric has a question? We must play the bloody notes. Then play the notes and cut the crap! Beethoven would appreciate it. Not to mention the audience. Is it you who reads Ekelof? Yes. You're right to do so. He's one of our greatest poets. This is my favourite. This poem once saved my life. "With hatred for the crushing general stupidity. For the state and the law, the family and the Church, the lie and the fear. And to desecrate false innocence. To ravish the beautiful facades. To force cleanliness to see its own filth. To make sense realise its madness. To whitewash the sepulchres. And wipe out the scriptures. On rotting piles of acanthus leaves, the souls fall in the banks of truth. And bodies burn in the furnace of love. When the time comes. When the time comes, we'll have the strength to live each other's lives. And the right to live our own." It's bloody good. It is. Hi. Hi. Thanks a lot for the book. Do you like it? Yes. No. Keep it a while longer. Okay, thanks. Can I give you a ride? I live at my boyfriend's outside the city. That's okay. I need to calm down somehow. Take the backseat. What a day. At the end of the day, we were getting somewhere. But then someone gets up and says: "I have to get home. I booked the laundry room." Christ. Booked the laundry room? It's just so fucking Swedish. Is it? I haven't eaten all day. Is there a restaurant nearby? No. Well, yes, there's a pizza place. Perfect. Pizza with beef and Bearnaise sauce. Delicious. Good. Thanks. Marie told me your mother was a concert pianist. You have to hear this. Listen. What do you think? It's really good. Yes, it is. It's amazing. Karajan. It sounds as if they know what they're doing. It was nice that they played fast. Right. I keep saying they have to concentrate on tempo, intensity, address. They have to know what to communicate. But they seem to think that their effort is sufficient. Maybe they just don't care. Laundry... I started playing the violin when I was 11. At first, my teachers laughed at me. They advised me to give it up. So I decided to prove them wrong. And I kept at it. I went my own way and gave everything to my music. "Courage is life's only measure". My motto is to be as true in life as possible. How do you do that? You do it. You look after everything that's true. Everything that's true is beautiful. They can't stay out all year round. Get a geranium for your bathroom. I know she was in it. I saw her. Hi, Mozart. What's up? We're celebrating. I'm pregnant. My boobs are getting so big! Her name's actually Berit Spears. She was in it. No. Look what it says there. It says... Bridget was in Idol. I have to get up early. You're just a receptionist. It's not like you're winning an MTV award. We're having a party. Come join us. Sit down and chat for a while. Give me a hug. Okay, okay. Employed on trial period in the city, fancy stuff. Then you have no time for your old mum. She thinks she's someone special. A little better than us. She's got a little problem with reality, this girl. But okay, we'll have to try and understand her. Stop it! Get her out of here! You're fucking insane! Calm down. Let go! Why don't you watch America's Got Talent? I bet you think that's funny. Hi. ...the same goes for this recording. We have to find a new and more airy expression. Let's raise our glasses. Our funding has been increased by 16 millions. See what a little resistance can do. Long live the cultural revolution! Cheers! So you're a true revolutionary? One of the old hippies? Are you behind all this? You never know. I have a feeling it was you. Wait. Hi. Come in. Thanks. They're nice. Hang your coat there. You look so fine. I got my first pay today. What do you see? Pain. In our time geniuses are stuffed with pills until they lose their souls. Why? Maybe it's a conspiracy. What kind of conspiracy? Real pain is the starting point of all human development. So, yes, it is convenient for those in power to stuff a lot of pills into the citizens, so that they're happy in front of the telly, eating crisps. They're sitting there satisfied with their crap lives instead of changing anything. That's right. What would you like to drink? Water. Pier-re. Pier-re Byrdue. Pierre Bourdieu. No, I can't. Here. Arthur Schaupenhuwer. Arthur Schopenhauer. That's what I said. No, you said Schaupenhuwer. He's a bit too depressing for me, but thought-provoking. Look... Here. This is the one I talked about. Soren Kierkegaard. This is the one who says you can do anything if you have the courage. "Courage is life's only measure"? Right. I think you'll like it. Hi, baby. No, I'm just reading a book. How was the flight with the little guy? Good. Well, it's your first time in Milan. Then go back to her. I don't want to disturb. We'll talk later. Kiss. Here? Yes, and there. I'll connect you to the box office. Thanks and goodbye. There's a new position coming up that would suit you. They need someone to look after their new youth programme. Someone who can promote music to young people. You fit the bill perfectly. You're so in touch with real life. It's a permanent, full-time job. Are you kidding? I'm just on a trial period. I know Marie would like to give you the job. She's recommended you to the management. Really? Thanks. The Concert Hall, Katarina speaking. Mattias, don't call me here. My battery died. I had to work late and slept here. Yes, you can sleep here. What? It was a serious attempt, but she'll be fine. She'll stay a couple of days. Then we'll move her to another ward. You can come and see her there. It'll be a while before she can get home. I understand your family has had a hard time. I think it'd be a good idea if you got a little support in this situation. You can get professional help for this. I want you to know that. We want to help you, Katarina. What the fuck did you tell them? That I'm mad? That I should be locked up and lie next to mum in the psychiatric ward? Calm down. I must get back to the reception. It's unmanned right now. We've been together for two years. We can talk about this. I was worried. Where were you last night? Have you met someone else? No. Have you? Have you? Who the hell is it? It doesn't matter. It bloody well does. Who is it? Adam. It's Adam Lagerwall. Are you screwing that conductor prick? Why the hell did you do that? We've made plans. We're going on holiday. Then you can't just screw someone else. Say something. We're not meant for each other. I bet there are lots of other girls in town you can watch telly with. I'm sorry, but I have to get back to work. Thanks. I'll take over now. Did anything happen? No. Where is everybody? They're at Toscana. They're celebrating. Can I have a glass of red wine, please? You're early. Did you hear the rehearsal? Amazing! Everything fell into place. Intensity, focus, love, madness, address. Everything was just spot on. It was really amazing. That's fantastic. You've got a spot. Henric! The great artist! The virtuoso! Without you, we'd never have made it. It's the truth. Thanks. Come in. I called and called last night. Thanks, I know. My wife has returned from Italy, so I had to come up with an excuse. Something happened? My boyfriend and I split up. I think. Katarina... We've had some really great days. I think you're lovely. But my family needs me, and I need to concentrate on my job. Right now we're in a flow which is important to hold on to. Okay? Okay. Good. And now I have to work. By the way... Make up with your boyfriend. If you make an effort, it can be worked out. Give me my keys. Thanks. And my MP3 player. You look a bit worn out. I thought musician's cock made you happy and spiritual. Calm down. Are you telling me to calm down? I know you've fucked half the town, but don't you have any boundaries? Huh?! Say something, for fuck's sake! You never say anything. I don't know if you're a nutcase, but right now I don't give a shit. I just know that I don't like you anymore. I'll pack your stuff. Come and get it some other day. I don't want to look at you. Leave. Just leave. Bye-bye. Thanks for coming. Now, fuck off. Leave. Get the hell out of here! Please fuck off! Hi. Hi, Katarina. How are you doing? Good. Really good. We're approaching greatness. You made up with your boyfriend? Yes. We solved our problems. That's good. No. No, no. Yes, come on. No. I miss you. Why can't we talk? I just want to be close to you. You... Katarina. Come. Was it nice? Yes, thanks. Maybe we can meet tonight? No, I'm busy. A conference. The love we've shared has to be free in order to breathe. Just like music. If you cling on to it, it'll die and wither like a rose in your hand. Hi. Welcome. A glass of red wine, please. Henric. Henric? What are you doing here? Drinking. Can't you do that at your local pizza place? I can sit where I want to. I work in the Concert Hall. This is my bar as well. This is not a good idea. I've had a long argument with my wife. She found a hair on our couch. You can't sit here. You understand? You're not allowed to be here. Yes. No. These shelves were in a mess, but now I've organised it all. Katarina... It has never looked so tidy before. I have to let you go. I'm sorry. But it was still a trial period. Stefan can cover for you. I didn't do anything wrong. I've done everything I was told to do. It's not my decision. You said that I should stay on. That I was to handle the youth programme. Some individuals in management don't want to employ you permanently. No. Hi. Hi. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. The Concert Hall, Katarina speaking. She won't be here until Tuesday. She's off. I'll do that. She'll be back on Monday. Thank you. Bye. Pack your things. Get moving. The Concert Hall, Katarina. Come on. Let go. Come on. Thanks. Do you have Rachmaninov's piano concerto? With Richter. Let me have a look. Yes, it's in the music department. And a book by Kierkegaard, please. Any book? There's one about how you should think. About daring. "Courage is life's only measure." I think I know the one you mean. How are you? Good. I'm doing great. But I'd like to have my job back. I'd really like to have you here. But if Adam has become annoyed with you, there's nothing I can do. But stop by and say hi. Yes, I'll do so. Bye. What the hell are you doing here? I want my job back. You'll have to back off and stop following me. Hi. Thank you! It feels bloody great, I must say. I'm coming. I just have to... ...change my shirt. You just start without me, okay? Yes, do that. Bye. I was to look after the youth. I'm getting a divorce because of you. But maybe it's nice for you to know that you've accomplished something. I know we can't be together. I just want my job back. Christ! "Courage is life's only measure". Yes. But if you can't handle reality, don't dabble in philosophy. Then you should stay in your place. If you want to move up in life, you've got to make an effort. But I have made an effort. No, you haven't. Maybe you have up here, but not in the real world. Look. That real world, your real world. Why don't you dance for me? Come on. It's your music. Dance. Come on now. Who knows? Maybe if you dance well, you'll get to keep your job. Good. Turn around. Turn around. More. Faster. You can do better. Good. That's fine. Fucking great. What am I thinking? Of course you should work in the reception. Thanks. Katarina... You're a nutcase. You'll never work here again. But... little darling. Are you here? Are you sad? Huh? Are you sad? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We don't have all the time in the world. To get anywhere, you need to be constructive. You have to make an effort. And what nobody knows... ...doesn't exist. How's life in your new flat? It's good. It's not that big, but I like being closer to the city. I'm so proud of you. I'm terribly happy that you've succeeded. You're a role model for the girls here, and you defy the statistics. This ends your dealings with the social services. I wish you all the best. Thanks. We're trying to move on. Tell Marie that the teacher called in sick. We'll manage on our own today.
