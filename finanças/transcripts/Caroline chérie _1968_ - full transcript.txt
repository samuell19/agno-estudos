DARLING CAROLINE JULY 1789, PARIS Caroline! Caroline! Caroline? Caroline? Caroline! Caroline! I'll be away for a while. I have more important business than arranging your marriage. If you want a handsome young man, pick Magnac-Laval. Magnac-Laval? But everyone says he doesn't fancy women. Maybe, but since you fancy men, it'll work out, and you'll remind him of a page he used to love. You're a monster. You're talking to your father. Don't forget that or I'll get mad. -Please, Sir. -Such a beautiful sight. You're being indiscreet. Would you care to become the director of my gallant affairs? -No, I only have contempt for you. -You're looking for a duel, thinking you might make a name for yourself in Paris. I'm a lawyer. I'm well known at the Palais de Justice. I do not seek to be famous at the court. I despise the court. You do? I despise it. Yes, Madame. I do however I honor the people. So what are you doing here? The people are throwing a little party around the Bastille. -You'd fit in. -I'm with the damsel. My protection isn't superfluous in a society whose only passion is idleness, whose only morals are frivolous, and whose only rule is pleasure. Are you always so solemn when you plead your cases? I'll come and hear you. Georges, give me a tug, will you? Your client is getting upset. Georges, give me a tug or I'll get mad. -Caroline, I love you. -If you love me, do it. Look who's here. Gaston! -Hello. -Well, let's shake hands since it's the latest fad. Might as well practice it. -This is fun. -Indeed. -Hello, Gaston. -Hello. No, no, no! Not like this. The palm needs to be looser, and your fingers tighter. Like this. Let me go, I'm still upset with you. What crime did he commit? Yesterday, I was supposed to meet Isabelle at the Dutchess's and I missed her. And I almost perished of boredom waiting for you. I wasn't exactly having fun. I was busy dumping that bore Clothilde. Are you becoming jealous, Isabelle? Miss? What do you want, sir? This young lady lost her handkerchief and I'm returning it. -If I may, sir... -I'll handle it, sir. "To my eyes You are no ordinary mortal "The words you speak Are worthy of the gods "They have the power To ravish and please me" You promised you'd answer my question. Georges, what was that question you asked me? -I asked you to be my wife. -Oh, right. How long have you known her? I saw her once or twice. I may have danced with her but I'm not sure. Doesn't beat around the bush. You're a noble lady, I'm a commoner, but you wouldn't lower your standards by marrying me. The high society you see here is doomed. The age of the courtesans is over. The King himself will find out sooner or later. The future belongs to men like me, not to them. They're a lazy bunch. Good for them. Isabelle, when Gaston will have broken up with her, in about a fortnight, please be a doll and let me know, I'll be next in line. And I'll be right behind you. She's up to a good start. She's very talented. I'll get her to write licentious poems. We would lead a dignified life, righteous but charming. I own a nice house in Montmorency where we could spend our summers. In Paris, I'll share all of my projects with you. Her father's a spokesman for the nobles at the Estates-General. Don't you brandish her note like this. Look at her. She can't help but stare at us. Is she being discreet? She threw herself at me, and I don't really like being used. I wouldn't mind. I hate prey that are too easy to catch. What's wrong, Caroline? Are you ill? Georges, please, I beg you... Don't harass me. -Do you want to eat something? -I want... Perhaps I want the impossible. The poor child just swooned! You did this to that poor girl. She's overwhelmed by her desire for you. Let her touch you. I have smelling salts in my coach. Come with me. -Do you love me? -Huh? I was so scared. I didn't dare ask you. How would anybody not love you, darling Caroline? I'm so lucky! Did you know I wasn't able to sleep at all last night? But you need some rest. Novels are silly. At least the ones I read. The heroine is always sad, and yet it's so simple. Let's just be happy together for life! What a brilliant idea! You love me now, but will you love me forever? I swear to you I will love you forever. -Do you know what we'll do? -I'm your slave. Tell me. I'll take you to my father in Paris and you'll ask for my hand. Nothing could give me more joy than to fulfill such a sweet project, but what if your father came to discover that we've only met twice? He could stand up against such a sudden love and decline my request. However, if we waited for a while... You have nothing to be afraid of. He's determined to get rid of me. He'll ask for nothing. He'll say: "Take her". -I know, but... -Let's go, shall we? No, you need to be reasonable, Caroline. It would be inappropriate of me to be in your company without a formal appointment when I introduce myself to your father. It wouldn't be worthy of the gratitude I feel for the man who's responsible for your spectacular beauty. -You think I'm beautiful? -Beautiful and pretty. It's so rare. -Am I really a different breed? -Yes. Are you proud that you found me? Proud and happy. And overwhelmed. -Did you hear that? -Yes, I did. A storm. They'll get soaked. That kind of storm will get them worse than soaked. -Why? -It's the cannon. Caroline! Caroline! -I'm looking for Caroline. -She's not here. I must find her. If we don't leave, the city gates will be shut. What's going on? Bastille is being stormed. I must find Caroline. Her father trusted me. Check the opposite way. I'll go this way. Gaston! Caroline! Caroline! Caroline! Here she is! Your Caroline! She wasn't lost at all. And that rascal slit the governor of the Bastille's throat. Excellent. That's sure to upset the Queen. That's all I care for. I can't stand her. I'd like to see her get whipped. My Lady, if they whip queens, what will they do to dutchesses? I wonder how we can avoid a revolution. The only way to avoid a revolution is to be a part of it. We're fighting. I regret taking you on this trip to the country. Don't. Did you enjoy it? I enjoyed it very, very much. IN THE MEANTIME, THE PEOPLE OF PARIS HAVE TAKEN THE BASTILLE This looks like Monsieur de Launay! My Lord, first, I wish to explain to you my political position. No, you won't, young man, or I shall skewer you with a sword. I've heard you before at the Assembly. I thought I'd perish of boredom. You won't trick me twice. You have contempt for the people. I don't know them, but neither do you. And you're afraid of them, as I am. You talk about their happiness but you're just a petit-bourgeois who wants to gain influence. Spot on, am I right? Sir, I'm asking you for your permission to leave. What did you say? I thought you were here to ask for my daughter's hand. -Indeed. But... -Well, I will allow it. Don't come in. This rascal's getting on my nerves. -That's why I've decided to leave. -I don't want to. I've made up my mind, I'll cross the Rhine and live abroad. No, I don't want to. You can't make me. I'm not planning on taking you with me. You'd be a hindrance. I'm leaving alone. Many will come to regret not doing the same. As for you, you're getting married. He's a commoner, he won't suffer from the revolution. It might even turn him a profit, since he's its outspoken advocate. I've spent your dowry a long time ago, but the man does not care, he's already wealthy and we're ruined. He's deeply in love with you, which leads me to believe he'll dote on you. What do you think? Answer me. -I don't love him. -Who asked you to love him? You're too foolish, Caroline. I've been in love a hundred times, but never with your mother. It would've been so ridiculous. I picture myself telling my dear wife: "My dear, I love you". She would've died laughing. Where did you get that notion? -I'm in love with another man. -Once you're married, you'll be free. You'll see the man you love. It's only natural. And there will be other men too. You can love whomever you want, but get married first. My love is unrequited. -That'll improve once you're married. -No. It won't. He loved me once. And he no longer does? That's life. But when Georges... It's my fault. I disappointed him. I gave him the right to despise me. You gave him the right to despise you? -Does this mean you gave up... -Everything. On the day they took the Bastille. -How is this relevant? -It isn't. That's what I thought. Such childish behavior! This shows how urgently you really need to get married. -So, about Georges... -It's Gaston that I want. The thing is, the former asked for your hand, not the latter. This is the fact of the matter and our only option. -It's Greek. -What does it mean? It means there are things that depend on us and others that don't. It's not up to me to give you Gaston, but it's up to you to accept Georges. I do not accept Georges. You want money? Talk to my manservant. He handles my creditors. I have no clue. What a surprise! Miracles might exist. I was thinking about you earlier. Really? I never stopped thinking about you. I understand. You were so busy thinking about me you never got back in touch. But I did write to you a couple of times, didn't I? Are you sure? Since we parted ways on the 14th of July, I've been desperate for any sign of life from you, and you never did. All right. I was afraid my billet-doux would be intercepted by your father. -That's why... -You had to ask him for my hand. Oh, right! I remember now. We did mention that. Marriage is no joking matter, Caroline. I have such utmost respect for this noble institution that I hate to see it being taken lightly. That's exactly why I'm here. -I need your advice. -My advice? I'm getting married to Georges Berthier. Why? Georges loves me and my father wants me to marry him. What should I do? It's surely advantageous for a maiden to get married, especially if the husband loves her and her family agrees to their union. You won't forbid me from marrying him? Gaston would never forbid one of his mistresses to get married, except if it's with him. I haven't seen you in months. How have you been? My bad. You're getting married. How silly of me. Congratulations. Who's the lucky guy? Georges Berthier. You know, that attorney from the Convention. Congratulations, Caroline. I hate you! But you are wrong to blame me for being deceived by our dear Gaston. I hate him as well. -You're still my darling Caroline. -I hate you even more! Marriage will calm her down. I hope so. My God, what's going on? Don't tell me you're genuinely sad? Would you even be capable of that? You're becoming sentimental. After seeing Caroline's assets, my dear Georges, I wish I were in your shoes. -Look. -No, he mustn't look. Georges, go wait in the other room until we're finished. Your presence is inappropriate. What's inappropriate is this little ritual's ribaldry. There's nothing I hate more than lewd whispers at weddings. The three of you must leave at once. Caroline, we'll leave you to your ogre. If he starts devouring you with his enormous teeth, call us. Good night, Iphigenia. I hate all the pomp, the whispers, the looks on people's faces, people laughing about the wedding night. It's the immoral and frivolous legacy from a past marked by servitude. You are a woman, I'm a man. We freely chose to join our destinies together. just like nature commands us. This is a serious and pure moment. What we are about to do is to express our trust in the future of humankind. I'm disrobing now. Disrobe. Just like that, in front of you? There's nothing worse than false modesty. A virtuous man and a virtuous woman have nothing to worry about reverting to their natural states. And nature requires something else: it wants you to obey me. As your spouse, I am now your boss. But you'll have as much authority over my heart as the authority over your person bestowed by my sex. You will reign over me if you reign over yourself. Do you find this principle unpleasant? Your principles? I'm having trouble with my dress. I'm used to having my maid help me. Give me a hand. I have no patience for gallantry or ribaldry. Being solicited for help that's not needed irks me. Act like the Romans would. This does not mean you'll have a boring life. I will take advantage of the fact you're a woman. You'll learn to be cherished through your favors, and respected through your refusals. I wish to honor your chastity without having to suffer from your coldness. I have no qualms forgiving you for this flirtatious look. I will always forgive flirtatious behavior if it's to preserve your virtue. Madame! I have too much self-respect to resort to violence, but you should perhaps grant me your favors freely as it is within my rights. Dear child, we are about to experience true bliss. Don't lose yourself in it. Ecstasy can wear out all the other pleasures. My dear wife. My lady. If those monikers scare you, I'll call you "miss". Don't turn your back on me! Let me see your face! -You're pushing me out of the bed! -No, I'm not! No! You have childish fears, darling Caroline. -Let me get closer. Trust me! -I don't want to! Come here! -No, I don't want to! -Come on, now! I don't want to! A FEW MINUTES LATER... Caroline, there's a question I'm afraid I need to ask you. Don't, you already know the answer. -What's his name? -I won't tell you. I demand to know that wretch's name. Sir! Sir, I'm afraid your daughter was not in the state I was entitled to. What does that even mean? That she's no longer a virgin, sir. -Congratulations. -Thank you. But you shouldn't be congratulating me. Well, my condolences, -but this is your fault. -My fault? Yes. All those beautiful new ideas of yours will turn young minds upside down. When that's the case, they're bound to frolic. I thought joining your family... Joining our families does not waive your right to be cuckolded, dear sir. You'll just end up as the very first republican cuckold. -You enjoy this, don't you? -I've enjoyed nothing, sir, for a very long time. This is why I'm leaving the country. -I trust you with my daughter. -I'll take care of her. "Without pleasure, my situation is awful. I can't take it any longer. "I feel a need to flirt, which would rekindle my fire, "not because I want to feel the truth "but to inspire it." It is now Dr. Guillotin's turn to speak. Fellow citizens, in the century of the Enlightenment, society cannot continue to subject those men that it is forced to dispose of to the barbaric methods of the past. This device is steeped in reality. The blade strikes like lightning, the head flies off, blood gushes out, the man no longer exists. This stubborn animal is postponing my demonstration. A man would've already understood what's expected of him. You need to trust mankind. The Republic is proclaimed. Europe soon coalesces against the nascent republic. Volunteer armies rush to defend the borders. Citizens, I will not be quieted! The people's will gave me a seat at the Convention! It is my duty to justify my actions! It is my duty to speak out, and I will! Talk to your Phrygian cap! I will talk to the entire nation! You repulse the nation! The nation has no time for traitors! You were bought by Pitt and Cobourg! You sold yourself to the Duke of Brunswick! Citizens, venomous calumny, poisonous hate... You're suspected of betraying the Revolution. Answer the question! From the start, I've shown only dedication to the Revolution. You goaded for the king's death! I voted for it! I am despotism's most fierce enemy! May the enemies of the people bring their heads to the gallows! I voted for it and I applaud it! It's the Girondaise conspiracy! Citizens! You blame me for crimes I did not commit. I wanted this Republic because I hate tyranny! And yet you are being led towards a tyranny that's a thousand times worse. The Terror will never intimidate me! Up till now, you were the one sending people to the guillotine. It was in the name of virtue and purity. You've found someone purer and more virtuous than you. I'm not beyond reproach. You're right. I had to pick between my love for you and my love for the Revolution. I chose the Revolution. What is the Revolution deep down? You shouldn't have forced me to choose. If you hadn't been an absent-minded airhead who laps up the most inane twaddle, -you would've been interested... -...in what you're interested in. It's in the interest of humankind for centuries. For the most prodigious enterprise on Earth since the Roman republic. You'd rather wallow in your licentious novels. Between a foolish goose, who are a dime a dozen, and a unique event, I chose what was unique and I don't regret it. In spite of the tragic circumstances I find myself in. -It's serious. -Yes, they wouldn't let me speak. You don't know it all. Robespierre has been trying to outlaw us. Tell him I'm no sheep. I won't go to the guillotine with a smile on my face, as the nobles do. -What about me? -They'll arrest you as well. -Why? -Because you're my wife. Not really. -Have our friends been told? -All but Caillois. We need Caillois! You know where he lives. Go fetch him. Quick. I wish to talk to Citizen Caillois, the deputy. He left for the Citizens Convention, and he won't be back. Hey, citizen! Straying around Paris at night? Show me your citizen's certificate. Where were you going? I was going home. You live rue de l'Echelle. That's the other way. -I was visiting a female friend. -Spill the beans, citizen. It's not a female friend, is it? No. CITIZEN PLEASE WIPE YOUR FEET Where are you going? I've come to see Citizen Gaston de Sallanches. I might finally get some sleep one day, when all the whores in Paris will stop showing up. Second floor! Is this you, Isabelle? Justine? Antoinette? My husband fled and they're looking for me, so... I see, you got scared. And justifiably so. And you remembered me. I never forgot you. Not even for a day, nor for an hour. I'm going to leave as well. I've decided to join the army. I'm springing to the rescue of a nation in danger. I signed up and I'm leaving tomorrow for the border. I prefer war to prison and to the guillotine. And I hate war with a passion. It always takes place in the country, and I hate the country. Nothing bores me more than nature. Except in your company, my love. Are you pretending to be in love with me? Don't you believe I am? No, I don't. How cold! This is insulting! You do not love me. I crave you, and you know it. I adore you. It's not nice to talk about love without feeling it. What? Is it because I was too shy to tell you I love you -that you second-guess my feelings? -Gaston... What are you doing? Gaston, if you love me, let me go. My darling Caroline, if you wanted to, you could make me so happy. No, you promised you'd behave. Let me go. This is an order. Leave me alone! All right, I'll leave since you are so hateful. You know that I love you. No. No, you don't love me. You know I adore you, Gaston. Are you reassured now? It's such a shame that desire is not love. Do you still have your doubts about me? You bit me. Ouch! It's already a shame that Count Gaston de Sallanches hasn't been "shortened" yet, he keeps me up at night with his aristocratic harlots. I'll see that the neighborhood's patriots do something about this. I'll be back with them in 15 minutes. -We only have 15 minutes, Caroline. -Don't be scared. I know I can scare you. I'll stop. But I love you. -Did you hear me? I love you. -Yes, I heard you. -You're handsome. I like you. -Yes, but hurry up. I don't want to leave this place! I don't want to leave you. Hurry, Caroline. If we stay here, we die. We die. I hope you're not taking me back to my husband. You couldn't possibly allow me to go back to Georges after what happened? I admit it's a chilling thought. Chin up. "The Convention voted for the arrest of Pétion, "Roland, Guadet, Louvet de Couvray and Berthier. "Those insatiable bloodsuckers "fled toward the Gironde department "in the foolish hope of revolting against the nation's will. "This new crime condemns them to swift punishment". You can see that he abandoned me. Well, why don't you abandon me as well? Go join the army. I'll rescue you first. You're safe here, Caroline. Gaston was right to trust you with me. -Am I bothering you? -Quite the contrary. I wonder how I coped with this horrid day until you got here. My regiment has assembled. I must go to war. Again? But you could get yourself killed. It's not as dangerous as Paris. Leave if you must, but make sure you don't get killed. Goodbye. Can I say goodbye as well? Do you mind if I go last? I love him. Can you really love someone and be unfaithful? We can find out for ourselves. You could offer yourself to other men? It happened, which is fortunate. And I hope it'll keep happening from time to time. I'd rather die than cheat on Gaston. -Seriously? -Seriously. I'd rather be dead than lie with another man. I recognized her right away, sir. She's Deputy Berthier's wife. She could be hiding in the bedroom. Is this a joke? I'm afraid not, citizen. The people's vengeful voice has fallen upon you. Where is Citizen Berthier? Come on. Deliver her to us. This is your last chance. How can I deliver someone who's not here and whom I don't even know? Go ahead. The Republic is ready to forgive you if you tell us where that monster's hiding. -What about the bed? -Right. Citizen, it is our duty to continue our search... -in your bed. -In my bed? Are you satisfied? We are leaving. Goodbye and I wish you fraternity, citizen. While the Convention recruits volunteers across the nation, suspects are hunted down. It's The Reign of Terror. Caroline had to flee Paris. Nice linen indeed! That shirt of yours must've cost around 200 pounds. -I don't know, it was a gift. -Interesting choice of words. Who's the aristocrat you stole it from? It's precious enough to be a gift from a gentleman. My hubby's in law enforcement. He gave me a duchess's cap. -Citizen. -What's going on? I want to help. If you want to live, follow me. -But, who are you? -The postilion. Without me, you'll be arrested. You're safe. Hard work deserves a fair reward. You owe me a kiss. Is that it? I'll just help myself. After all I did for you, it's my right. No! No! No! -No! No! No! No! -Calm down! No! -Turns out, with a man I don't love, -Good night, cutie. it can be just as nice as with the man I love? What's the matter? What do I do after sunrise? You'll walk out. You'll hop on the coach with a cute smile on your face. You got nothing to worry about. I lied to you earlier. I'm the only one who recognized you. -You bastard! -I hate that, girl. No. Don't call me "bastard", call me "Citizen Postilion". We're no longer a monarchy. I could be called "scoundrel" before, but that's over now. Gotta be polite with me. Postilions are now free with the same rights as anybody else. You lied to me! Did I really? It wasn't a real lie, more like a ruse. All is fair in love and war. It's your fault for being so pretty. You were as satisfied as I was. What are you complaining about? You bitch! I'm gonna calm you down. No, no! I beg you! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! The beauty of her clothes gave me a hunch. Me too. And, this morning, when we woke up, -she was gone. -So we searched the place, to figure out what's going on. And we found those papers, in the name of Citizen Berthier's wife. So we warned the patriots, so as to prove we aren't involved. They're looking for you. I have nothing to do with this. I wouldn't want you to think that... I betrayed you. Like... "She's gonna think that..." Will you hurry up! I looked everywhere, under every wisp of straw. Lucky for her I didn't find her! Yes, had I found her, I wonder what I would've done to her. The nation is under threat! Liberty is in peril! The nation is under threat! Citizens! Hatred for the people has united kings against us under the flag of tyranny! The shackles to enslave you are being forged at the border! The hordes of Pitt and Cobourg threaten the peace in your homes! Will you let Europe's despots live, you who are liberty's only hope? May all of you who are brave enough join the fight at the border! Fly away, children of our nation! Take up arms, citizens! Your name? The Republic congratulates and thanks you, citizen. Tomorrow you'll leave for the border. Next. A servant who can read and write? I give up. A servant... The Republic congratulates and thanks you, citizen. Tomorrow you'll head to the border. Next. Dressed like that, he must know how to read. -Do you know how to read and write? -I do. That kid wants to fight, but he's far too weak. He can't grow a beard yet. You should take him with you. -Is it true that you can read? -Yes, I can read. Prove it. "The monsters that dreamed to stifle the Revolution were stifled. "Luzeau ended up being executed, "Roland ended his criminal existence on his own terms. "The remaining federalist traitors are Berthier "and his wife, Caroline de Bièvre, "who'll roam the woods as a wolf until the patriots come for her". Congratulations, my boy. Wanting to run to the border to fight for your country is great. But you'll be just as useful to it by serving me. I'm looking for ore in the region. I'm a geologist. It means I study the earth. And I don't do it out of pleasure but to accrue the forces of our threatened nation. -Do you want to stay with me? -Yes. You will share my life, we will comb the country. Sometimes, we'll sleep under the stars. Most of the time here. I have a passport that says I travel with a servant, -so, if you agree... -I agree, citizen. -What's your name? -My name is Gaston. Gaston. A bath will do us good! Even animals love baths. You guys treat your filth as if it's a gift from the Lord. So, are you going to strip? I can't swim. In Ancient Rome and Athens, all the boys could swim. Well, I can't. When they couldn't, they'd learn to swim. Well, I don't want to learn. When they didn't learn, they were mocked and would die of shame. Mock me, I may die, but it won't be from shame. You dolt, you have too much shame. For your body and that of others. Bible study has driven you guys nuts. How could you not see that the human body is Nature's most beautiful and pure achievement. For an empire, you would still blush at the sight of a nude body, even if he's the same gender as you. You're too dim, too backward. Is that all? What about aquatic pleasures? Let me show you. No! No! The only dolt around here is you. Here you go. Catch me if you can. A DISCREET INN We have to sleep in the same bed, or else people will get suspicious. But I'll give you my word: you can trust me. But I do trust you. -That's all I ever did. -I'm a true Republican. I don't talk much about virtue, but I practice it. I have no reason to doubt you. I have no pity at all for your husband, Georges Berthier. He's responsible for the situation you're in. As for you, you're just an innocent victim. And I always side with the innocent. I can see that. You have nothing to worry about. I'm married and faithful to my wife. -You're also married and... -And what? And it's to flee a mortal peril that you sought out my protection. A protection that is absolutely disinterested. You can sleep tight. Oh. -Thank you. -Good night. VIRTUE IS HIS ONLY REWARD ROBESPIERRE "THE INCORRUPTIBLE" -Excuse me, I... -What are you doing? I'm looking for my black pants. How silly of you! You know, Jean, I can touch your pants without dying of confusion. Don't succumb to the prejudices we inherited from feudal times. That's him. Yes, that's him. I also recognize that tart who pretends to be me. Her husband had defended my father. She's Georges Berthier's wife. -The former deputy at the Convention? -Yes. All right. Let's go! VIRTUE IS HIS ONLY REWARD ROBESPIERRE "THE INCORRUPTIBLE" -Gaston... -Hortense... Caroline. No... No. No! -They're here for me. -I'll go and check. Poor soul! You are committing a crime. Hurry up, or the harlot will get away! Caroline, climb out the window. I loved you. I love you. Leave! Go away! Shivering from fear and cold, Caroline, at dusk, gets to the Castle of Bièvre. But she's worried. What will she find in this place she once called home? Doctor Crailly! My dear child. I never would've recognized you at first glance. You were but a child who was fleeing... with her father... and... I left a castle that was mine and now you own. These are difficult times. Your father's possessions were auctioned off when he emigrated. I swear I bought the castle so I may return it to your father someday. -It would be simpler if I did. -Don't you believe me? Do you doubt me? Not only did I see you grow up, I delivered you. Without my agile fingers, we would've used pliers. -Are you warm enough now? -More or less. Aren't you finishing your pâté? It cost me a lot of effort. To get it, I saved the butcher's wife who suffered from diarrhea. I had to go five times. I performed the cold wrappings myself. I got this wine from Touraine from a child delivery. Twins. I got twice the promised number of bottles. I gave up getting paid in assignat bills. We can't refuse them, since that's against the law. But the law allows for other arrangements. I got this hare from a poacher with rheumatisms. Don't you like it? -I'm not hungry. -You haven't eaten anything. You're burning hot. You're shaking. Go and lie down, I'll have a look. Paris sure changed you. You didn't make such a fuss back in the day. My hands gave you life. Have you forgotten? -I haven't! Have you? -Be reasonable. You suffer from bronchitis. I need to check for pleurisy. You're an outlaw. You were banned. And you're silly enough to seek refuge somewhere everybody knows you. I gave you shelter. By doing this, I risk the death penalty. Do you think I'm risking my head because I enjoy getting slapped? DENOUNCED Citizen court clerk, will you write down that the first crime committed by Citizen Caroline Berthier was to travel to Paris in 1789 with her father, the Count of Bièvre, who sat at the Estates-General out of spite for the people. Clément, listen to me. Her second crime was to marry Deputy Berthier, a notorious seditionist, who, after pretending to embrace the nation's cause, -ended up betraying it. -Clément, you know that... First of all, citizen, addressing me by my first name is fine. However, this isn't the relationship we had when I was your gardener. What's revolutionary is that we're equals now. But what did I do wrong? You did nothing wrong. I've always been nice to you, haven't I? I never said you weren't. So, if I never hurt anyone, why hurt me? Hold up, citizen. With kind of twisted logic is this? -You're a snake! -No, I'm not a snake. You belong to a race that must be destroyed, since you believe you are above us, because you are fueled by despotism, because you condemn the people to servitude. There's nothing you can do about it, but that's life. It may seem unfair, but, generally, it's necessary. -Clément... -Stop calling me Clément. The crimes of this citizen having been committed in Paris, that's where she will be sent for her trial. Poor thing, is there anything I can do for you? -Free me. -Anything else? You can give me a comb. And a mirror. I'd love to be you right now. Don't think I have more hay on my side... -You're a woman. -How advantageous. Yes, it is. Get pregnant and you'll avoid the guillotine. You get nine months. -The revolutionary tide could change. -I would need to get pregnant. But I'm here. -You don't waste any time. -I have so little. I hardly know your face. Would you rather know your executioner's face? If only I could be sure... I'm too honest to lie to you and tell you it's a surefire thing. I can only compare myself to a lottery ticket. Try your luck. Kissing never got anybody pregnant. No! No! No, I beg you! No! No! No! The Terror is so effective that every prison in Paris is full. People had to get creative. This is where the most famous aristocrats rub shoulders. Prisons have replaced Paris's fashionable salons. Except for the fact that dying is the only way out. We're done up there! Go! Go! Caroline! Caroline! Come. You will replace Adélaïde. The poor thing left this morning. -Left for where? -Forever. -And Gaston? -I was expecting that question. -He's alive. -He wasn't arrested? He was made captain. He's fighting near Arras. -Do you still love him? -Yes. Me too. Caroline... What is it that's so funny? At your trial, you said you'd prove your innocence. No, no. It was charming. Don't mock her. Why would one mock me? Because you have no idea how the revolutionary court works. The judgment is but a useless formality. We're always sentenced to death. Let that sink into your head. Citizen Isabelle de Coigny! A letter just arrived. I promised to deliver it to you quickly. It's impossible, I must be crazy. I have no clue what I'm doing, what I'm saying. -He wrote this himself, Caroline! -Gaston! He's on a mission in Paris. -He'll come here. I'll see him. -Does he know I'm here? No, of course not. How would he know? He talked to a lawyer, a friend of Robespierre's. Thanks to the lawyer, I'll be moved to the Pension Belhomme. What is it? It's kind of like a clinic. Heaven on earth. Dr. Belhomme, the owner, is friends with the public accusor. As soon as you pass the threshold of that house, you're saved. Gaston! Gaston... Hurry up! When will you people be done? I forgot to tell you Caroline had joined me. Can you lend him to me for a while? You can be cruel sometimes, Caroline. All right, you can have him. After all, I still have my entire life ahead of me. My love! -The horror. -My love, you mean "the joy." We had lost each other, and we're back together. Caroline, please. I'm too... too overwhelmed. -From seeing me again? -No. From seeing you here. Why? You can send me to the Pension Belhomme as well. Caroline... I managed to get one person there. I can't do it again. This is horrible. No, it's normal. You told me I was the one you liked most. Turns out, that wasn't true. -Why are you so dramatic? -Caroline, understand my position. I understand it very well. You have the choice between saving Isabelle or me. You picked Isabelle. I'm fine with that, but please, spare me the theatrics! And from now on, you're not allowed to think about me! By the way, no need to worry. I nearly got caught ten times, but I've always escaped. I'll get out of this. There are other men than you! -Don't talk to me like that. -Well, there are other men than you! Men have hurt you. -No, not always. -Caroline, I don't believe you. Well, it was very enjoyable. And I'm ready for another serving! Caroline! Come back. The visit is over, citizens! Citizen Caroline Berthier! Citizen Caroline Berthier! Caroline... Caroline Berthier! My dear, don't be afraid. It's surely a mistake. Which one of you is Caroline Berthier? Me. Finally! It's about time. I can understand dragging your feet to get in the wagon, but she's leaving in a fancy coach! You're off to the Pension Belhomme. I'm Citizen Chabanne, at your service. My role in this house is to assist Dr. Belhomme so as to make our tenants' stay as comfortable as possible. What an honor it is for me, citizen, to have you here. Did you know that, back in the day, I treated your dear husband? -Is he still on the run? -Yes, Doctor. What a time to live in... Good thing the doctor is here to gather all those innocent victims under his wing and to bring joy back into their lives. Yes, joie de vivre. The joy of living peacefully and sleeping easy until... until... until... Tuesday. Gaston de Sallanches paid for eight days. Congratulations. Congratulations. Eight days... Have you seen my new hat? This is your bed, dear citizen. I'm afraid you can't have your own room, but you will be in charming company. I'll let you get acquainted. I'm Caroline Berthier. -You're the deputy's wife? -Yes, citizen. Well, my dear, I won't congratulate you. Did they chop his head off? -No, citizen. -I hope they do it soon. Let the man get a taste of his own medicine. That said, you are charming. Thank you, citizen. It's only been three days, and I still owe you two. Come back tomorrow night. I've got your money. Come in. What's that look on your face. Now I have to recalculate. Is that all? You know you only have one day left. That's all I could get. A pretty girl like you? So tender and curvy. I don't believe you. If I were you, my sweet doe, I wouldn't settle for one day, I'd pay for an entire century. I am putting out, though. You can tell. I didn't even bother getting dressed. -Does that help inform you? -I don't need the details. I'm a man who likes virtue. You could shock me. But I love beauty as well and I praise God for helping you out once again. What I told her is the truth. I would be distraught if I had to give the executioners such a ravishing neck. Be quiet, you horndog. You only have money on your mind. What about you, kitty? I think of our future. We have enough money. You brought in 1,000 francs today. We're rich. The time has come to enjoy our money. We need to move on and leave for the country. What about my wife? You always forget my wife. What did you promise me, Belhomme? I'll keep my promise, but let's continue for a while. Saving human lives is beautiful. Come on. Getting richer isn't too bad either. We'll end up getting guillotined. Someone will end up denouncing us. We'll be punished for paying magistrates to send us accused citizens. A speck of dust could take us down. Doctor Chenoux wants to take over. Tomorrow, I want you to settle this with him. And I don't want to hear another word about your wife. We'll be leaving next week. Understood, Belhomme? Yes, my sweet otter. Five! Six! I'll put this down for 1,000 francs. Any takers? Me. For 100 francs. And me, for 90 francs. Let's meet in the middle. Let's say 95. The gem is a bit gray, it's a rough polish. The setting is shoddy. I would be courting you, My Lady, if I paid more than 50 francs for it. I used to own the country's most beautiful diamonds. I used to own the country's best horses. I sold my horses and you sold your gems. Accept our price and don't delay the game. My dear Boimussy, the stakes of this game are my head. This applies to all of us, Madam. So, My Lady, how about 90? You said 100 francs. Then I said 95. And now you're saying 90. Not any more. The exchange rate for diamonds is plummeting. -85. -80. Will you sell it for 80, dear friend? I'll let you rob me, but I will never accept your friendship. At your command, My Lady. Does the dutchess really love this game? She doesn't love the game. She loves life. And life is expensive here. Terribly expensive. You're about to get further proof. Eight! Nine! -It's going up. -What's going up? -The rate of the assignat? -No, the rate of guillotine executions. I follow it every day. Two days ago, in Paris, 58 people were executed. Yesterday, 68. -And now, 77. -Hand me the gazette, my dear. Where's the list? Here it is. Lavoisier. A chemist, not a huge loss. I'll resume... That must be the deputy. André Chénier. Never heard of him. Isabelle de Coigny. Now, that rings a bell. Yes, I know her. I took the waters with her in '87. Yes, I remember her. She wore such ravishing hats. Caroline! No, leave me alone. I'm furious. Are you in love with me? I'm in love with a man who isn't here. -And I love you. -No. You feel the same thing for me that I feel for you. Except that you don't want to be faithful. Are you that faithful to your husband? -My husband? -I apologize for this nonsense. The Revolution has made me unforgivingly inept. Help me console myself for being so foolish. No! I'm off. You're consoled. -But... he wouldn't have to know. -Whom? The man you're faithful to. Yes, but I would know! -I would know and I'd regret it. -Regrets! How sweet! -I already regret it. -Caroline, just one kiss. -One too much. -Thanks for the compliment! Spend the night with me. Consider it! Please! Not having you before I die would be atrocious! Caroline! Caroline, stay! I won't be able to sleep at night. No big deal, you'll think of me. "My darling Caroline..." For the first time in my life, I realize the only person I care about in this world is you. I only think of you and the money you need. I'll get it soon. Don't worry. "Ask Doctor Belhomme for a week's credit". One week? -That's impossible. -Not even one day. But Gaston is sure he'll find the money! We can't set a precedent. What if everybody did the same? But I promise you, in eight days, Gaston... I need the money tomorrow. -Or else... -Or else? You're sentencing me to die? But, no, no. Not at all. We sentence you to get the money by tomorrow. That's it. But where can I find it, since Gaston...? There are other men than Gaston on this earth. Some men here are wealthy. They'll be delighted to help a sublime woman such as you. -What if I'd rather die? -Then... it would be your fault, not ours. And you'll be guillotined for your foolishness. But you're too clever. See, she's thinking about it. Do want their names? I know for a fact that the Van Krift brothers would be interested. You'll have your money tomorrow. Come in! -Excuse me. -Come in. The gods did love me in the end. They must really love me to send you to me. You are misinterpreting the reason for my visit. -Gaston... -Gaston? Gaston promised me he'd send money to Dr. Belhomme and I learned today that he needs another week, but... But Dr. Belhomme does not want to wait. Poor Caroline. And you thought I could help... -I'll pay you back when Gaston... -But I can't. Come sit near me. Come. Caroline, I'm broke. -I thought... -I have nothing left. I had the choice between 20 days here and 40 days in a crowded jail. I decided I'd rather live well and die sooner. Tomorrow, the first step is the revolutionary court, and the second one is the guillotine. But you, Caroline, you have no right to die. You're too young, too beautiful. The only ones with money are the Van Krifts. You won't be the one who will be soiled. It's them. I'll never forget you. That's something I've often said. But this time I mean it. For the few hours I have left, I'll be thinking of you. We told you to sleep with the richest and you bed my poorest patron. She's an airhead. She chose the most handsome man. Gaston! -This is an honorable establishment. -Gaston! You can't run around naked after some man. One day, two days... one week, two weeks... You have three extra months. Are you happy? I'll come in for tea. One more day, and he'd have been saved. France, which had tired of the excesses of The Terror, brings down, on this day, the 9th of Thermidor, the tyranny of Robespierre. Citizens, with the death of Robespierre and his sycophants, it is not the Revolution that has come to an end, but its excesses! That's not bad. It works. It should go well. "...with the death... "of Robespierre... "it is not the Revolution... "that has come... to an end... "but its..." Caroline! "...excesses!" Caroline! Listen to this. -"Citizens..." -No, I'm furious. This dress matches the shawl I was expecting by noon, -and I'm still waiting. -In the meantime, listen. Tomorrow's speech. I need to make a splash at the Convention for my comeback. The nation needs to know that I haven't changed, in spite of the vicissitudes. I don't miss those vicissitudes at all. -Neither do I. -Neither do you. That's right, you must've had your own trials and tribulations. That's not a bad idea. This is how I'll open. "Citizens, "virtue "has finally... triumphed... over the tribulations... "and vicissitudes... "that villainy... "had thrown in its path." It wasn't virtue that got me out of trouble. Not virtue? What was it then? My eyes, my legs... Your eyes, to detect danger? Your legs, to run away? I did have a few pleasurable experiences. Caroline, I'd like to ask you a question. You've already asked so many. One last question. -All those men... -What men? You mentioned a geologist, a postilion, an aristocrat who got executed, another aristocrat who was locked in a prison wagon... Yes. So what? I just want to know... Between those men and yourself, would you qualify your relations... as friendly interactions, with underlying feelings perhaps, that remained... -Chaste? -Yes. Georges... Does this mean all of those men were your lovers? So to please you, I should've been beheaded? It was a dire situation. You were hiding and I should've tried to figure it out at the gallows? That's true. You're right. Excuse me, I have one last question for you. What is it? When you had to resort to this method, did you pick your partners? Did you only want me to deal with monsters? Well, I sure didn't. No, but I... I'd like to know whether... all those men... in their embrace... -Yes. -Yes. Did you feel... Did you experience moments of... I won't answer that. There's only one man who has the right to ask me that. Whom? The man I love. A CAMP IN BONAPARTE'S ARMY I hate nothing more than braggarts and swashbucklers whose vanity exposes them to unnecessary perils. Be warned. -Yes, sir. -Shut up. Don't interrupt me, even to say "yes". Especially since that "yes" is a lie. To be obeyed, you don't need to act like a lunatic. Who do you think you are? Do you know that you exasperate me? I'm making you colonel, but that's only because I know a bullet or a shell -will get rid of you sooner or later. -Thank you, sir. Why are you thanking me? For your new rank or the wish I articulated? -Both, sir. -Both! I don't like that. I generally retire officers who act like this! What do you want? -General, we just caught a spy. -Where? Near the camp. She was traveling by coach. She was looking for the 35th line. How did we figure out she was a spy? She's young and pretty. She speaks excellent French. The only name she knows in the 35th line is that of Captain de Sallanches. All right. Your next mission, Colonel, will be to interrogate that spy. You can do that all night if need be. Or several nights, if you feel like it. Yes, General. Once she's spilled the beans, if you still look so sad, I'll send you to the War Council. Got it? So, carry out your duty. Joséphine never did this for me. Go on! Spill the beans! -What do you want me to admit? -The sweetest admissions. There are too many of you. Even if I did have beans to spill, -I wouldn't tell you. -Well, whisper them in my ear. You're using any means necessary. We're fulfilling our duty, which is to interrogate you. Gaston, will you join us? Bonaparte trusted me with the interrogation. -They sent you a captain. -No, a colonel. You may leave. That general's a genius. I've become... I've become... I've become exactly... Exactly? The way you wanted me to be. RIFLEMEN REGIMENT -Will you leave me again? -I must. Do you know what happens when you leave me?
