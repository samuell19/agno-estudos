Listen to me carefully now. - We don't give in! - Precisely. - Hello, Maria. - Hello. You don't say hello anymore? You should watch your daughter, she's getting unruly. Keep her away from my son. Come into my office. İf you cry, I'll leave. I have nothing to say. The problem isn't so much what you've done, but your attitude. Alex is acting differently. The business with the bust is irrelevant. Eva! You should tell us what happened. Write! Please. Perhaps the meeting didn't define the facts. - Not at all! - Eva, please! I'm sorry. But you promised! I'm the one who made you, but I'm going to kill you! You said Eva was safe! You don't understand a thing! Stop it! That's enough! Where are you going naked? Go back in! Where are you going? Go back in. You promised. Let's talk. Get inside now, you jerk! You're shaming me in front of the neighbors! Idiot! - You “ed to me'. - La“, come here. Don't you see what's going on?

Mom will bring your pajamas. - You're not leaving? - No. - You swear? - I swear. Lie down now. What's that over there? Where? Over there. A painting. What is it? A boat. I can't see, everything's misty. Don't talk rubbish. It's the fever causing that. - Can you see now? - Yes. A boat... Great! Go in, you're not dressed! How do you know all that? Is he there? Yes! The police brought them here. His father tried to overthrow Ceausescu. And I know his name's Andrei. I want straight lines! - Good morning. - Good morning! I don't need to remind you that this new term is the last one in the school year. In this school, no one repeats the year! İf you don't succeed in class, you'll leave to work! Or go to prison if you prefer! You must learn to appreciate the state's efforts. I haven't finished. Some new pupils have joined us. Let's welcome them properly. I hope they will be able to mend their ways here. And become model citizens of our country! Like you, in fact. Welcome to prison! I'll say it again. Efficiency! Efficiency in the workshop, efficiency in class, efficiency at work, that's the goal. Let's get that straight. Get that in your heads. Andrei'.! Let us in. We've come to help you! Come on.

Let's see. What will my grandson do when he grows up? Let's see. Pick something up. My grandson will be a doctor. Choose something else now. A barber! The most important is good health. Let's drink, brothers. It's been a good harvest. What are they doing here? I can explain. - Hello. - Hello. Welcome. Congratulations. - Come in. - Thank you. Anca, did you invite them here? Leave it. Forgive my father, he's too busy. - Nucu can see to him. - Who's the master here? Just anyone can enter my house? I'm in charge here! - Sit down. - I'll get you something to drink. Go and talk to her. Go on. - What are you doing, Dad? - Get out! Who's in charge here? We're here to enjoy ourselves. I'm the one who decides who we invite! Bring plum brandy and some food. Just ignore him. Go to hell! This is my home, you crows! I bring who I want here! To your health. Cheers. Titi! What's going on? You want me to freeze to death, this winter? Mind your own business.

He brought medicine for your brother. Make an effort. You can see he helps us despite everything. His father is sorry, too. He's mad about you. He's letting himself go. Please, for me, dance with him. You hear me? Just once? We mustn't get on the wrong side of them. Come on. Let's take shelter. It's just a shower. We're neighbors after all. We have to help each other. Who knows what might happen. Colleague! Where do you live? You won't talk to me? She has golden hands! Don't you want to polish my nut? Give her your washer! Enough! Want a hand? They want efficiency. All you have to do is kiss me after. Bones is the best at kissing. What do you say, baby? I don't want to. What, Tudorica? Be my girlfriend? Bones, let's go! You've no idea what I can do with my tongue. You'll never manage like that. You haven't had enough? Stop that right now! He's mad as hell, comrade! I said that's enough! Let me grab him! Make room for me! The headmaster! I've told you to stay out of it. Go on! Get to your classes! Get to your classes! Give me that. There. Where? Here. There's still some. Know where? Here. Look out, here's the teacher! I know three colors in this world That evoke a brave people Valliant and glorious since the dawn of time That have fought and triumphed... That's good.

All right. Hi. I've brought some cakes. Very good. - Well, see you. - We need to talk. Look at me now as I truly am. To succeed, we'll have to work without emotion or feelings. My mind is worth more than this physical appearance. Just eat the cakes. I have to go. İf you go, our whole plan crumbles. You want to put me through a test? Our project is ambitious. I want to make sure that we'll be up to it. I have to undress? I don't mind. We'll have to pass through some very tough ordeals.

This Andrei' guy is brilliant! It's not great, huh? Come on, let's steal demijohns to cross the Danube! Do you know where Alex is? Why are you asking? His father's here. He's worried. I haven't seen him lately. What's going on? What? You don't know? Do you think I'm stupid? Pay attention to what you're doing. You know... - What is it? - Go to sleep! They're children. I know what I'm saying. Just keep an eye on her! You can't go out without my permission. Why not? Because! I made you... ...I'll kill you. Get out. Go on! They've found Alex.

Go to sleep. - Is this the one? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. When does it leave? I don't know. What do we do? We wait. What are you doing? The power's off again. What is it? I want to die. All girls go away one day. Mom went away with Dad, too. She'll come back. How do you know that? Do you know where Eva is and you won't tell us? What happened to this iron? Come here!
