(excited synth music) (mechanical whirring) (rock music) - [JTRO] So the story goes, that once upon a yesterday, way back in the dry ages, ducks ruled the Earf until some Beat God dude named Beat Massa X came down from the stars and brought the blood sport Beat-Beat Revelation and a comet full of booze to our world. He enslaved the ducks with the fear of being flipped straight edge again on the spot. Because as we all know, without no booze, they would become un-drunk. The Beat Massa descended upon them with his unstoppable army of L Black D's and 187ed the known duck world, in what we now know as the Beat Wars. And when da land was sucked dry of all of her fossil boozies the Beat Massa began the cycle anew. The Wet Shit swept across the land. 187-ing all the peeps, And 911-ing Mother Earf, refilling the fossil boozies for the new race of enslaved peeps to mine for him all over again. Us. In the Wastes of the old world, Beat-Beat Revelation is still the only way of life. Where the ultimate prize is the Quatro, or booze as it was once known. Whoever controls the Quatro, controls the Wastes. And only one Quatro oasis remains; the FP, our home. My name is JTRO. I'm a RE-NINJ. A Beat Warrior like my father before me. In the many battles we fought, beating off the rage fueled followers of Beat Massa X, we lost many loved ones. Until I met CHAI-T, The Beat Battle Queen from the Wastes who strengthened the FP with her tribe of Warrior Ninjawas and helped us finally bring peace to the FP. Shit was chill. We threw some pups. Our daughter, CHAI-TRO grew into a strong young Beat-offer. But sadly, due to some health politics, her brother, JR-TRO took a dirt nap at birth. Time passed until CHAI-TRO discovered she could beat through time with her feet on her 18th BD. She ventured into the past, helping us destroy Beat Massa X's booze comet that was poisoning our Earf. And together, as a family, we defeated L DUBBA E. Finally eliminating the Beat Massa's only remaining weapon from the Beat Wars. But our cycle's time has finally come. The Wet Shit, a never ending storm of sobriety from which there ain't no cure, has swept across the entire Earf and is on the FP's doorstep. Can we save the FP in time? Or will we become stone cold sober 4Evz? (mechanical whirring) (fantasy music) - Duck marks the spot. - So this is CHAI-QUACK-TICA, huh? - What's left of it. - It's thought it would be a little bit bigger considering it used to be the most advanced civilization on Earf or whatevz. - Well, it was once upon a long ago. - Yeah. Now no one even remembers 'em. (driving rock-synth music) - Ducks marks the spot. (driving rock-synth music continues) (musical jingling) Follow my beats, carefs. (light ringing music) - [Announcer] Stank! Whoopsiedooz! Floppy twat step! - Balance, yo. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. So do you really think what we're looking for is here? - The prophecy was hided here by the Way Backs. And only the descendies of the Way Backs can find it here again. - Oh boy. (ethereal music) Okay, so now what? - Two, four, eight. Two pads. Two peeps. - Too easy. - Left arrow, right arrow. - Interesting. - Three, two, one. (arrows ringing) - Okay, well that sounded good. Now what, four? - Left arrow, down arrow. - Right arrow, up arrow. (arrows ringing) Okay, I'm picking up what you're laying down. - Copy-roo. Eightses. - All. - All. (arrows ringing) - [Announcer] Two, four, eight. Combo mode unlocked. - That means don't miss any. - Yeah, I know what that means. - [Announcer] Three, two, one. Beat-Beat. - Here goes nothing! (upbeat synth music) Easy. We're on the same team! - Then keep up. - Ahh, fuck me. (upbeat synth music continues) - [Announcer] Chill. - You gassed? - I'm not gassed, I'm just breathing. - You look gassed. - JTRO, my youngling. You has finally come. - Mom? - I am her memzies. Left behind to guide y'all when the time came a-do. - Time for what a-do? - Your final battle. The one that decides the fate of all our peeps. - Stopping the Wet Shit, right, I know. - Faleses. There is no stopping the Wet Shit. The Wet Shit is the planet's defense system leading to a wet age that reboots the Earf and refills the Quatro. It 187'd the ducks as it will y'all if you fails. - How do we save our peeps? - There is hope. A cure for your peeps. The Fountain of 4Evz, where Bloody Quatro brews with the power of re-life, yo. - Wait, so where do we find this Fountain of 4Evz? - Not, wherezies. Whenzies. - Okay, then whenzies? - The Zero Dark. - The futies. - Correcty. Beyond your time. It hasn't activated in yours yet, but take heed, unlocking the Fountain of 4Evz will also unlock him. - Who? - Take the Quad-Force. It will show you the way. Only the Duckborne can save the Earf. Take the Quad-Force, it will show you the way. Only the Duckborne can save the Earf. - Mom! Mom! (computer whirring) (somber synth music) - You fresh? - I never even knew what she looked like before. - She had a pretty cracking rig for a holo-do. - Yeah, she did. (Intense magic jingle) So, do you know what any of that means? - Just the hot goss. We should get this back to DC. (somber synth music swells) (upbeat synth music) - Ducks in a barrel. (WMD quacking) (foreboding music) (radio whirring) - Chromedome, come on back. (radio whirring) Trailer Henge, hola. (radio whirring) Anyone at the 248? Anybody in the 2-4-8? (radio whirring) Fuck. (foreboding music continues) (intense thunder storm) Hasta la vista. - [Stanya] She's so jealous of my hot looks. She's always fucking worried that I'm hotter than her. She's right! - Fokliff! - Time travel? How 'bout I go back, time travel to my trailer and fucking kick your ass the way I should have! - So you sent me back in time so I could tell younger youse and dadzies that y'all got 10 365s to find a way to stop the Wet Shit? - Well, technically you sent yourself back through time. But, yeah, paraphrase. - Hevz. Did it work? - TBD, yo. - Well, now what? - Now we wait for Uncle DC to interpret the prophecy and then we does what we always do. The impossy. - Yo. - Yo, Dad-TRO. You really think we're tuff enough to 187 Beat Massa X? - Winning's not about strength, CHAI-TRO. It's about patience and commitment. - That's hevz. - Beliee' dat. - You rents is always so cryptic and shit. - A fool who says more than is necessary only proves that he is weak and shit. (glass smashes offscreen) - You're late. - I know. I know. What can I get you? - Me? - Yeah, you're over 18. You're awake. What can I get you? You know, they say the perfect drink can help you see the future and help you erase your past. - The right drink has nothing to prove. The right drink answers questions before you even ask. You heard? - Yeah, I heard! - You heard, but do you listen? - Yes, I listen! Oh my god, dad! The fucking Wastes are up to their fucking eyeballs in the Wet Shit! And whether you like it or not, in fucking 7 HRS's, so are we! You can't get away from it, it's impossible! You heard that? - Yeah. I'm not deaf, AK. Here, sip this. (magical jingle) Now, what does that drink tell you? - That the impossible is just something quitters made up to feel better about themselves. - Sentence and quitting rolls to Rage. - I'll drink to that. - You'll drink to anything, you're an alcoholic. - And I got that from you. You're my father. So... - Doctor said not to drink! (thunder rumbling) (soft synth music) (KCDC quacks) - Alright, hit me, what have we got? - A'ight gather round. It's prophecy mode up in here, bitch. Closer. Reading all this quack makes my ass all tender, yo. Yo! This ain't the post-apocalypse. It's the post-POST-apocalypse. The Earf 187'd twice cause of the Wet Shit. And if it 187's thrice- - Hashtag time's up. - Beliee' dat! - All right, so what's the prophecy say? - Y'all pronouncing it wrong. The Quad-Force ain't no prophesy, it's a proph-e-key. - What? (KCDC quacking) - There is four pieces of the Quad-Force. Balance, expeditiousness, aggression, and tempo. Combined, they unlock the Fountain of 4Evz, where the Bloody Quatro flows. The booze of resurrection itself that brings life and joy back to the un-lifed, yo. And it slumbers deep down in the Zero Dark. In the post-post-POST-apocalypse and shit. - Jesus-lou-esus. - But the Bloody Quatro you seek slumbers in the Fountain of 4Evz comes with its ass a price. Cause it's the very blood of the Beat Massa X himself. CHAI-LATTAY told me a time would come when I'd have to lay some knowledge on y'all. Now here I is ready to lay it. Your mother could also beat through time, for she was Duckborne. As are you, CHAI-TRO. - Duck what? - Duck Legend tells of a She-Ro of time known as the Duckborne. - Okay. - A warrior with the body of a mortal and the blood and soul of a duck, whose destiny is to help 187 the evil Beat Massa X once and for all, yo. - What? - All right guys, look, lighten up. Are you guys actually fucking for real with this shit right now? - This shit's as real as it gets, JTRO. It was your mother's duty to beat through time to this world to defeat Beat Massa X. CHAI-LATTAY whooped his ass. Locked him up tight, threw away the key. - The proph-e-key! (NITRO grunts) - But your mother new BMX would return, JTRO. As long as the Comet of Dawn poisoned the Earf, the cycle continues. The Wet Shit covers the land and Bloody Quatro begin to flow. Re-lifing his ass again and again and again. - The fuck are we supposed to do about it? - She said you'd know when the time came. But them wheels of time is rolling, JTRO. It's time we roll together. (loud thundering) (Quad-Force humming) - Whoa. But, I mean, real talk. This shit's pretty bev, hey. - This shit is a full on duck blur, yo. - Tell me about it. Now what? - [Alarm] Intruder, yo. Intruder, yo. Intruder, yo. Intruder, yo. - We got company, Yo. - Then I guess it's about time we address the duck in the room. (mechanical clicking) (dance music) (crowd cheering "Bop") Who the fuck are you and what the fuck do you think you're doing in my town? - I'm the weapon of mass duck-struction, Mr. FP. So don't make my ass quack! - What the duck? - I've come for the Duckborne. So toss her on over and shit won't get wet. - Come on over here and I'll show you wet, asshole. - 187, y'all, 187, y'all! (WMD laughing) - There you go, TRO-splaining my fucking ass. Condescending cunt. - Don't you TRO me unless you know me, motherfucker. - Oh, shit! - Calm-a-do. - This is calm-a-do. - Mo' fuckas love running they mouths til some one shoves some dirt down they throats. - Shut his fucking mouth! - The Duckborne or your town, Mr. FP. [Beat-Gat] Click, Click! What's it going to be? - Shoot his ass! - Face down and wet or face up and dry? - Shoot his other eye, for fuck's sake! - I ain't going to call all fucking day. - You going to do something? Or am I going to have to walk over there and make you do something? - Bap, bap, bap, motherfucker! - Fuck it. Let's bop. - A'ight. [Beat-Gat] Bang! [Beat-Gat] Blap! [Beat-Gat] Toasty! - Dadzies! [Beat-Gat] Sik! (CHAI-TRO screams) [Beat-Gat] King Killa! [Beat-Gat] De-LOOXE! - Whoooow! [Beat-Gat] Hit a house! - Fuck this! - I'll wait here. (upbeat dramatic music) (low rumbling) - Yo, 187, yo! Yeah! (WMD exhales) - Take that, duck-duck bitch! - What's a matter with you, you duck fucker? - Fuck duck fucker! (cheering continues) - Knock that motherfucker out! - Put him in a body bag! (ATRO laughing) - Now start quacking, duck face. - Come on! - What the fuck are you doing in my town? - You know. This. [Beat-Gat] Click, Click! (Beat-Gat fires) - Dadzies! (JTRO gasping) - You on the up and up? - Feel like I just got throat fucked by a sledgehammer. - Dadzie! - Hey! I'll fuckin' shoot you! - Yo rentz! - No! Oh, you sloppy fucking drongo! - Dadzie! - Just go. I'll catch up. Fuck! (upbeat music) (Stanya screaming) (water breaks) - Oh, shit! - Yo rentz! Dadzies! (CHAI-TRO Screaming) - [Announcer] Three, two, one, remix! (dramatic music) (waves crash) (CHAI-T sniffing) (JTRO yelling) - Oh geez. What? Where the fuck am I? - Atop of me! Get off! - Geez, sorry. Sorry, it's my first time travel. Where are they? - I don't understand. I was right behind them. - Okay, fine. All right, let's just focus on what we know right now. Which I guess is fucking nothing, right? - We need to calm-a-do. Refresh-ifie. At least we have the Quad-Force. - Yeah, about that. Um... I think CHAI-TRO had it when that WMD dude fucking took her. - So we've lost our little CHAI and we've lost the Quad-Force. (CHAI-T sniffing) - The future, huh? Far out. - JTRO, come-a-do. - Okay. Are you okay? (CHAI-T shushes) (CHAI-T shushes) - I didn't say anything. (CHAI-T sniffing) Is that CHAI-TRO's? - This way. - Here we go again. (rock music) (CHAI-T sniffing) ♪ I stand alone ♪ ♪ With my back to the wall ♪ ♪ The road ahead ♪ ♪ An endless journey ♪ ♪ I've never known ♪ ♪ How to answer the call ♪ ♪ But no one else ♪ ♪ Can do it for me ♪ ♪ In this alternate reality ♪ ♪ You can find me where I'm meant to be ♪ ♪ Searching for a better future tomorrow ♪ ♪ Tonight ♪ ♪ Our destiny is calling me ♪ ♪ I will lead us to the better tomorrow ♪ ♪ Tonight ♪ (US national anthem blows through the wind) What the fuck happened? They're all gone. - We never came home. (dark music) - Without CHAI-TRO, we can't activate the remix again. (soft synth music) - [BLT] BTRO's death wasn't your fault. It was his. He wasn't expecting the unexpected. But it sure as fuck expected him, you heard? And now yo ass is here so you won't make the same mistakes. In order to master Beat-Beat, you gots to master the four rules of the B.E.A.T. Gots to keep your shit straight. All evened out and dialed in to the end no matter what slaps you upside the cock-sucker. Never ignorant and getting goals accomplished. - Yo. Yo, JTRO. - Yo. - So it's true. You lost her. - I didn't lose her. - Well, she ain't here. So... In fact, you ain't never brought her around to see us. - She wouldn't understand. I mean, you guys, everything we went through together, it was like another life. - It wasn't another life, it was this life! And it still is, JTRO. - I don't know how to spit this shit easy, A'ight, I'm just going to blast it. If you lose, little CHAI-TRO, if you lose her, it's done. Everything is D-U-N, dun. - Forgetting who you was, forgetting who we was; that's what's made you weak, dog. - Word! Yo, things only appear impossible when you forget how you got here in the first place, son. - That's some real shit, JTRO. - I don't know what to tell you guys. I'm fucking old now. I'm not climbing anymore. Just feels like I'm falling. Waiting to hit the ground. - Falling is an accident. Getting back up, that's a fucking choice, JTRO. - Balance, expeditiousness, aggression, tempo. JTRO, that is what matters. Did you forget about that shit? Forget about us? - The only one you're going to be beatin' off is yourself. - Oh, whatevz. I'm going to go save my fucking daughter. I'm waking off. Peace. - You tink that worked? - Mmhmm. - Still got it. - Tanks. - You're welcs. Any time, Sis-TRO. - Wow, she's bev. - Legs go all the way to the butt. (distress signal) [Microphone] Yo! - Yo, if y'all peepin' this shit, it means we're all froze. Stone sober as F. A tsunami of Wet Shit is on the FP's doorstep. But it's all good cause this is how the proph-e-key say it do. If my calculations is correct, by the time y'all see this shit, WMD and CHAI-TRO's nearing PMC territory up north in the 242 where the wet shit goes all cold, yo. If you find they ass, you'll find the Fountain of 4Evz. Don't be fearing, JTRO. We all good here in the rewind. We just got to take a long ass nap and sort our shit out till y'all wake us up. See you soon, Ninj. Miss yo ass. (thunder cracks) Shit! Peace, hologram. Shit! (creature whinnying) - Somethin's walk aboutin'. - What kind of somethin'? (giant footsteps) Oh, fuck me. (loud thumping) (creature noises) Hey. Yo, you guys from around here? (speaking Spanish) (upbeat dance music) - Just so you know, this is your faultzies. We should have runzied. - Oh, come on. It's not my fault that shit's tough in the Zero Dark. - Calm-a-do. We'll figure it out. We always do. - Oh, what, you ain't fearing? - I ain't even half fearing. And neither would the JTRO I first met. - The JTRO you first met didn't have so many miles not so carefully driven on him either. To the death? - Excuse me? - So you half fearing now? (rising synth music) (soft synth music) (WMD quacking) - Good morning, Cranberry juice. - Don't you Cranberry juice me, duck boy. - Duck man to you, home girl. (magical jingle) - What the Quad-Force? That shit's mine! Give me backsies! - Ain't giving you backsies nothin'. Shit's mine. Fair and circle, boo-itch! - Oh, and you tie me if you knew it was real fair, huh? - And circle. (duck grunt) - You're a weirdo. You know that, right? - I'm dope as fuck I do what I want. - I'm dope a fuck. I do what I want! You're a weirdo. - You don't do shit. You're tied up as fuck. I'm doing whatever the fuck I want, when I want. - Cringe. What the fuck you doing hauling my ass around all these mountains through all this cold shit, hey? You got the Quad-Force. Do your thing. Peace the fuck off. - Cause this bullshit ass shit don't do shit without your dumb Duckborne ass. Only you can open the Fountain of 4Evz. - Then give it. - Nah. I'm good. - How about you untie me and we'll find out how good you is. One second with my paws free and youse is dead. I'm the She-Ro of time, duck head. (tape rips) (loud punch) (duck quacking) (distant party music and cheering) - I can't even with all this. Where the fuck is my life right now? - Just another step on a never ending journey, JTRO. - Jesus. How did it come to this? - Why don't you look back every once a-do? And memberz? - Remember what? It's not like my life ever really made too much sense. I mean, the first what, 18 years of my life, I was just some dip-shit kid who grew up on some dirt road in the middle of nowhere. I didn't even know it was the post-apocalypse. - Post-post-apocy. - Okay, yeah, exactly. And now look at me. What, I have magical powers, some time remixing She-Ro of time daughter? And I'm what, trying to stop some ancient Beat God tyrant from reawakening, who wants to destroy the Earf in the future? - Okay. We have a daughter and we're trying to save the world. This is our story. And you don't even know half of it. - Come on. What is that supposed to mean? - Do you even know that I'm from another planet? - Wait, what the fuck? You are? - Yes. It's part of what makes me me. - Okay, look, CHAI, I've always told you that I fell for who you is. Whatever happened to us in our past, it doesn't matter. - Well, it should. Cause that's how life works, JTRO. It's a whole series of whack-a-doo events that makes fuck all sense at the time that somehow always lead us to today. And you reflect on the experiences of those wack-a-doos so you can get to tomorrow. Or you can just ignore all that shit and keep making the same mistakes 4Evz. It's your choice. (synth music) (electronic music builds) (crowd cheers) (rising synth music) - Got any ideas? - If we don't beat off to the death, they'll 187 us both. - Nobody dies today. - Then keep up. - [Pine Mutant Language] Tres. Dos. Uno! [Pine Mutant Language] Beat-Beat! (rock music) (arrows whooshing) (rock music continues) (arrows whooshing) So you got a plan? Or are we just going to sit here and beat each other off all night? - I don't have time for that. - Hey, take it easy. - This is easy. - Okay, we really doing this right now? Okay. (rock music continues) (arrows whooshing) Don't do this, CHAI. Don't make me pull out the trick shit. - Please. You haven't pulled out the trick shit in a whole pile of 365s. (rock music continues) - What are you trying to prove? We're too old for this shit. - Oh, enough of this too old, blah, blah, blah, shite. I'm sick of it! (pine mutant language) (rock music continues) Remember who you is and youse can do anything. I know why youse is afraid of chattin' about the past, JTRO. Because it reminds you how much time has passed and how little you think we have left. But pretending to be who you ain't is what makes you old JTRO. Beat-Beat is in our blood, yo. It always has been. It always will be. So stop letting time tell you you're D-U-N. You tell time when you're D-U-N with it. Now let's go hundo P, JTRO. To the end. A'ight? (rock music continues) (arrows whooshing) [Pine Mutant Language] Chill. (soft synth music) (beat-pads hissing) (crowd cheers) (beat-pad hisses) - Mi familia! You've finally come. I'll drink to that. I'm sorry about all that beat off to the death stuff. But we can't just be letting any assholes in here, ya know? - These 242 Pine Mutant Ninjas are the last of humanity. Mutated from the Wet Shit. Evolved to live out here in the Zero Dark. Lots changed since your time, JTRO. But, NITRO said you'd come. - All right, how the fuck are you still like- - What? Alive? - Yeah, duh. - NITRO brewed me up one of his hibernation cocktails. I woke up 100 whatevz years later in a cave on the outside of town. When I emerged, I was surrounded by all these fucking weirdos. I napped my ass all the way into the future to help you guys find the Fountains of who gives a shit for NITRO. - All right, so where the fuck is it then? - Okay. It lies high a-top the highest peak of Mount Bitch. Deep within the Massa Pad. Invisy's to any but the Duckborne, blah, blah, blah. You know the legend. Look, LSS (Long Story Short), the only way to unlock the Massa Pad is. - The Quad-Force. - Yes. Which you've lost. - Misplaced. Take it easy. - Well, whatevz. Luckily, I had a couple people that spotted your duck homeboy and a young lady, which I can only presume is my niece, hiking up the summit just a few HRS's ago. - For realzies? - Uh huh. So drink up before the hot shit comes. I shall show you the way. (synth music) - Is we there yet? - No. - Is we there yet? - No, goddammit! Shut the fuck up! - Give some ansies! - What kind of ansies? - Oh, I don't know, how about who the fuck is you and why the F-U-K is you do-sing and all this shit? - A'ight. But shut your chex guzzler, cause I only be spittin' this shit once, okay? You heard? The Duckborne that came before your ass. - Gramma-LATTAY? - I'm monologueing, motherfucker! Shut it, okay! Anyways, your Gramma imprisoned my Massa's Massa, BMX. My Massa's mission was to find the Quad-Force and to wake my grand Massa up. But you and yo rentz slit my pops ass and now all this shit's up to me and shit. - L DUBBA E was your pops? - He raised my ass. Call it whatevz. And now we're hitting up the Fountain of 4Evz. When my Grand Massa's icy cold ass harvests the Bloody Quatro and ages it the perfection while he sleeps. - Hold up. Bloody Quatro? - Magic booze that can re-life anything! Pay attention, dummy! Jesus. - Fuck you and your magic booze boo shit. What's with all this TLDR, hey? You ain't Duckborne. I is. So why's your posing ass wearing all that duck shit? And flashing it all over town? - Because my Massa fucked up, a'ight? He took the wrong kid. You was the Duckborne. The She-Ro of time boo-shit, not me. - Hold up! Don't try and gazzump me. What's under that stupid helmet? I know that ain't a real mug, dummy. - The beats is strong as F-U-K with my fam. With my mum, my pops, with me. And with my sis. - What the H-E dubba L? (tense music) Bro? - So we getting close or what? - When the twinkies fade and the hot shit comes, the Duckborne will be shown the way. - Oh, you're so boring! - Oh, for fucks sake. - What do want me to do? - Do your shit. - I don't know what the fuck to do. - Figure it out. Easy duckets. (Quad-Force ringing) Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas. (Quad-Force ringing) (eerie music) (beat-knucks power on) - Let's go! - Yo, duck head, end of the line. (beat-gat bangs) - Momzies! (WMD quacking) - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're not D-U-N yet. It's not time. You're not D-U-N yet. - Is she a breather? (somber music) - I don't know. Kinda. - Kinda? - I mean, I took one of those blasts once. I did okay. - Barely. And your her size times two. - What happened? What'd I miss? Oh. One of those days, huh? Look guys, I don't know how to sugar coat this, she looks really fucked up right now. - What the fuck are we going to do? - The Fountain of 4Evz. It's the only way to re-life her. But you better go going fast because she needs Bloody Quatro now. - You're the She-Ro of time, right? - Yeah. Hundo P, that's me. - Then let's go fucking prove it. - Guess I'll stay here. (epic rock music) (tense music) (whispy lion growl) - Hold your horses, dick head. - What are you waitin' for, motherfucker? - Yo. Dad-TRO. - Dad-TRO? What do you mean Dad-TRO? - He's my bro. - The fuck are you talking about? - He's got an eye patch. - So what? A lot of people wearing eye patches these days. - No one has eye patches but TROS and you know it. Sure he's got a lot of Waste miles on him or whatevz. - Fuck you! - But it's him. Fuck you. - JR-TRO? The mother F'n fuck, man, you died. - Yeah, past tense and shit. - Yeah, what kind of and shit? - Let me just hit you with some BP's. L DUBBA E found my ass. Gave me a 2.0 at life. He raised me and shit. And we dreamed of a day, a day where we'd free our Grand Massa from the cage cast upon his ass by the ducks and the CHAIS! And together, we'd escape all that and we'd escape all that boo-shit and we'd rule the whole wide Earf 4Evz. But you all took that dream when you gave my Massa a dirt nap. So here I is, dose'n what I can with what I gots. - What? What are you doing all this shit for that fucking ice cube over there, man? - Because that ice cube over there gave me everything! His blood gave my ass what neither you or mom-CHAI could. Life. - We did the best we could with what we had. - Oh yeah, the road to Rage is paved with good intentions, ain'ts it? - Don't you give that shit! If we had access to magical god booze blood from another world, don't you think we would've used it on you? You're my fucking son. - Bio-son. Nothin' more. [Beat-Gat] Click, Click! Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew! [Beat-Gat] Freakin' blap blap blap blap blap! A'ight. Fuck it. Do you're thing. I got some resurrectin' to get did. I'm about to bust a fuckin' duck up in here. (keys clicking) (computer whirring) - [Computer] Launch Beat Massa reanimation sequence Initiating. Initiated. - All right, I got an idea. - Spill it. (WMD laughing) - My fingers are fast as shit! - There comes a very important time in every adult's life when you need to kick the living shit out of your sibling. Today's that day, CHAI-TRO. - So down. I'm sick of listening to that poser quack. - Check it out Ninjas, I'm ghost-typin'! - But what are you going to do, hey? (musical chime) - I'm going to do what I do best. I'm going to Beat-Beat this shit right again and send that fuckin' ice cube packing back to wherever it came from.
