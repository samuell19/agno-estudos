This is a possible 415F I repeat, 415F Proceed to 1249 Hastings South of Havertown and report what you find to Detective Freed immediately. I'm on my way. Copy that. Where's my baby? Where is he? What have you done with him?! Your baby is fine. The doctors checked him out and he's fine. You'll see him soon. Now, Mrs. Baldwin, please. Tell me again. Start from the beginning. What happened before the motorist found you and your baby in the middle of the road. When... When I got home... He... He was on the phone. Wi-with a woman. I didn't talk to her, but... but-but I... I knew that it was a woman. She's not back yet. Who cares? Just hurry up. I'm not gonna wait all night. I can't leave the kid alone here! Oh yeah, right. Father of the year. They should give you an award. I will get there when I get there. Where the hell have you been? You were supposed to be back an hour ago. That was her, wasn't it? - It was a client. - You're a liar! Okay. It was my mistress. It was my bookie. It was my male lover. It was the FBI. It was the Reader's Digest Book Club. Take your pick. The fact of the matter is, June. You're a jealous, paranoid nag. And trying to live with a bipolar woman is enough to make any man nuts. You know, I promised myself that I would give you one more chance, for the sake of Sammy, to be a husband and a father, to be a man. That is it, Tony! - Hey! Where you going, eh? - Oh! To get Sammy. Oh, yeah? You can go. I'll even help you pack. but my son, he stays here. You're a lawyer, Tony. You should know that battered wives generally get custody of their children. Nobody's gonna believe you. - You're always acting so crazy. - Let me go! All those pills they give ya. They mess with your head. You say he hit you a lot? I never told anyone. But lately, it's, uh, it's been getting worse. You've been examined. All we found was that bruise on your arm. Could have been caused by anything. He's too smart to leave real evidence. Then what happened? Please? Tony? My son stays with me. Yeah? I've got a lot of things to do, Tony. So what's the deal, are you coming? No. - What do you mean no? - Let's get this over with! - No, now is not a good time. - Why the hell not? - Junie's acting a bit crazy. - Oh, well there's a surprise. Yeah. Look, if you want to call the whole thing off, that's fine with me. - No. - Well then, tell her you've got an appointment. Look. I... I can't. - Why not? - I can't leave. I... I'm sure it was her calling back because he went into Sammy's room so I couldn't hear. Look. I can't talk now. June's gone nuts. But I followed him. And I didn't care what he was saying. I just wanted my baby. But when he turned and saw me, he blocked my way. and he stood in the doorway... And then he... He gave me that look. That... That he always gave me before he hurt me. And I couldn't let him hurt me again. I... I couldn't let him do that. Why didn't you just get the hell out of there? And leave my son? No... No. I... I couldn't do that. I... I... I had to do something. - So I hit him. - With what? The... The statue. How hard did you hit him? I don't think I hit him very hard. Where did you hit him? On the shoulder. Here. Okay. What did he do after you hit him? That wasn't very smart, June. I was terrified. I've... I... I stepped over him and-and-and I-I-I grabbed my baby out of the crib and... I-I ran down the hall and out of the house. - I'm at the house. - Copy that. Dispatch... This is Parelli. - I'm gonna need some help here. - Copy that. Dr. Moyer, dial 6. Dr. Moyer, dial 6. Sorry about that. So the first time you hit him with the statue - it was on the shoulder, right? - Yes. Then you hit him again. Where? On the forehead. But you also hit him in the back of the head more than once, didn't you? No... No I told you. I only hit him twice. You caved in his skull. What are you talking about? Alright. Alright. You only hit him twice. Did he go down? Yes. Was he unconscious? He was trying to get up. Was your husband alive the last time you saw him? What are you saying? That he's not alive now? Is my husband alive? No, Mrs. Baldwin, he's not. 12 years is the best deal you can make? Well, look on the bright side. I'll be out in 8 if I'm a good girl. But you need to go to trial. You can't plead guilty to manslaughter. I don't have a choice, Claire. They say that I hit him 4 times. Twice after he was on the ground. The case against me is overwhelming. There is no way that a jury is gonna believe self-defense. And if they convict me of murder, it could be 25 years. Sammy will be grown up. I'll take good care of him. Claire, you'll bring him to visit when he's old enough, right? All the time. - Hi. - Hi! Oh... I'm feeling so many things. I'm really scared. A part of me just wants to go back in there. Oh... It's ancient history. Sammy's coming back soon. I spoke with him this morning. He's having fun with Billy and his family, but he can't wait to see you. So where are they today? San Francisco. Relax, June. It's going to be fine. Letting you out a week early was a nice surprise. You should have let me cancel the trip so Sammy could be here Oh no, I really didn't want him to miss it. This is a great phone, Claire. Thank you. You've thought of everything. I have been fantasizing about this burger. What's that, hm? Ah... How's that Proladine working? They finally found the right dosage. And boy does it work. If I go off it for even a day, I can tell the difference. Bipolar for life. Yeah. So that job I was telling you about. - Mm. For your friend's company? - Mm-hm. Well, he's out of the country right now, so it can't start for a couple of weeks. And... it's part-time. That's okay. Thank you, Claire. There is something that I really need to do - before I get settled anyway. - Sounds important. I have spent hours going through my case file. And in the beginning, I was just so depressed and down on myself that I believed that maybe I really did kill Tony and I just couldn't remember. But you were frightened for your life. Anybody would have... But-but-but then, somewhere along the line, the fog lifted and every moment from that night became crystal clear. I only hit Tony twice. 2 times. And then, I-I stepped over him. I grabbed Sammy and I ran. Tony lunged for my ankle. Claire, when I left Tony he was alive. So if what you're saying is true, then someone else, the realm murderer came in. The front door was wide open. But Junie why would anybody do that? Well, that's what I have to find out. I think if I were you, I would just put all this behind me. And start fresh. I have to prove my innocence. I can't let Sammy live his life believing that his mother murdered his father! But it's been 8 years! I mean, how are you going to prove that you're innocent now? I don't know exactly, but I'm gonna figure out what happened that night and I'm gonna find out who wanted Tony dead. And I'm gonna start right away. Of course he likes you... Jason just didn't get a chance to know you very well before you went off to prison. When you brought him those few times, it seemed like you had to drag him there. Jason isn't the most outgoing guy but he understands that you need a little help getting back on your feet and he's fine with that. Deep down, he has a good heart. I can't believe this is your house, Claire. Jason's done very well. Wow... Forget bookkeeping... Maybe I should get into investment banking. Does Jason need a partner? Oh, Claire, it's just lovely. June, I'd like you to meet Megan, our housekeeper. Oh... Hi, Megan, nice to meet you. - Hi, June. - Oh, sorry, we were a bit late. - We got stuck in some traffic. - No problem. There's a pan of lasagna in the oven. - Thanks. Good night. - Good night. Oh... Okay, well, let's get you settled. And then I've got to go get ready. - Oh, get ready? - Yeah. Drinks with a woman who is working on a charity fundraiser with me. I'll only be gone a couple of hours. Well... maybe I'll wait up for Jason then to thank him for letting me stay. He's driving back from a conference and he won't be home until late. Why don't you just chat with him over breakfast? Alright. So... what do you think? Ah, wow... Claire, it's great. Good. Um... I'll put another blanket on the bed for you. And there's, um, a robe and some extra towels in the bathroom. Oh... I really... I would love to take a shower. - Go ahead. - Great. I can't believe it. She wants to prove she was railroaded?! I mean how the hell is she gonna do that, Claire?! I have no idea, but 'how' isn't really the point, is it? Yes, it is. It means we're screwed, Claire. I mean, our whole plan is based on the fact that everyone believes she killed her husband. Nick, listen. I'm not saying this isn't a big deal because it is, but we can handle it. We just have to stay on top of what she's doing, make sure she does nothing more than spin her wheels. - But... - Oh, honey, relax... I've already switched out her medication. So tomorrow night should be very interesting. Okay, honey. Here she is. June! It's Sammy! Thank you. - Sammy! Hi, honey! - Mom! Hi! - Guess where we're going today? - I give up. Tell me. We're driving to L.A. to go to Disneyland. And, uh, we're gonna get to see the Queen Mary too. - Oh, that's great, sweetie. That sounds like fun. - Yeah. And did you know that the Queen Mary has 12 decks and weighs over 80 thousand tons?! I did not know that. And some people say it's haunted. Wow... Well, you better be careful then. Hey, Mom, I got to go. They're getting ready to leave. I'm gonna see you really soon, okay? - Alright. - I love you, Sammy. Bye! Oh! I cannot wait to see him. I'll bet. - Well, there's the birthday boy. - Mmm... - Oh, happy birthday, Jason. - Thank you. I... I really appreciate you letting me stay here. Sure. What are your plans? We have plenty of time to discuss that later. Right now, June and I have to decide on what she's wearing to your birthday party tonight. Oh, there... there's a party? Oh... I forgot to tell you about Jason's dinner party tonight. It's no big deal, Junie. Just about 15 guests. Okay. It sounds good. Thanks for including me. I think I probably should finish getting ready. Charlie's gonna be here any minute. We're gonna go see Karen Smith. Do you remember her, Tony's secretary? I always thought that she knew more than she said she did. So I think that she'll be a... a good place to, uh, to start. Charlie? Yeah. She's... she's my friend from... prison. Oh... Yes. Of course. Her friend from prison, Claire? I mean, that's great, isn't it? I wonder what they're doing. Maybe planning a crime spree? At least, the guns are under lock and key. She wants to prove her innocence, Jason. Well, that's stupid. Isn't it a little late for that? June is really vulnerable right now. Well, so are we. She's not just an ex-con. She's a murderer. She bashed her husband's brains in, for god's sake. - He abused her. - Well, why didn't she just leave him? She was afraid that he was going to take Sammy away from her. Oh... Hey... Let's not argue, okay? Oh, I'll get it. Charlie... - It's a friggin' palace, Junie. - I know. Jason, this is my friend, Charlie. Charlie, this is my brotherinlaw, Jason. Hi, there. Mm. Um, so... we'll... we'll see you later. Alright. Let's go. Well, you're right. It looks like she's home. Yeah, I told you. She lost her job a few weeks ago. Thanks for tracking her down, Charlie. - Good luck. - Thank you. Ah... Great. Who is it? Hi, Karen. - Do you remember me? - June? Uh, what am I doing here, right? Um, I can't see you now. I uh... Just a few minutes of your time, that's all I ask. No, you don't understand. I've got a job interview in less than an hour. Please. Okay. Thank you. The house is a mess. You should've seen my place the last 8 years. Karen, I don't know what you think of me. I'm sure that it's not good. But that is not why I came here to see you today. I came here to ask you, if you can accept the possibility that someone else killed Tony. Can you do that? Yeah. Good. Thank you. It's no secret that Tony was cheating on me. What I need to know... is how much and with whom. - That was a long time ago. - It's important, Karen. I never approved. You thought it was none of your business. I understand. I needed the job. Did you ever meet any of them? No. I just made the reservations and paid the credit card bills. You never mentioned any of this to the police. Why? - I was afraid. - Of what? - Of getting involved. - But you were involved! I figured that's why you killed him, all the women. I thought if I told the police, it would make things worse for you. Look, I need to get going. These women, can you think of any one of them that would've had a reason to kill Tony? All of them, probably. Where did he take them? I don't remember. Okay. Then, then, where did he take you? He didn't take me anywhere. Look. I told you I have an interview. Please go. I just lost my job. I don't want any trouble. There won't be any trouble if you just tell me the truth. Okay. I had an affair with Tony while I was still married to Will. I know. Where did he take you? Why do you need to know that? I promise. This will stay between us. Just please tell me what happened between the 2 of you. - Over there by the fountain. - That's a great idea. Hey, Nick. Oh hi, Mrs. Givens. This finishes up what we owe you for the front yard. I can't wait to see what you come up with for the back. Well, your husband's got great taste and big plans. So I hope you don't get sick of seeing me every day. Ogh. No, of course not. Your men are competent but I feel a lot better with you overseeing what they do. Well, believe me, sir. I like to be 'hands on' whenever possible. Um, I will let you two get back to work, but give him a good deal. It's his birthday. Okay. So... so that was it? You... you went out with him a few times and then it ended 6 months before he died? It was a terrible time for me, June. And I was doing drugs. I'd attempted suicide. I was a mess. - Tony would listen to me. - And, and, and... During these nights, would you, would you always go to the same place for, for, for drinks or dinner? Not always. But we went to a restaurant in the suburbs a couple of times. Um... Riverside Heights maybe? I can't remember but Tony was real friendly with the bartender. If you come back tomorrow, we could go and try to find the place. Okay. But, er... the bartender, what was his name? Craig. Or no, I think it was Greg. Um, why is that important? Because if I can find out who else Tony was sleeping with, then maybe I can find out who killed him. A jilted lover, uh, a, a jealous husband. It's-it's a starting point. So who, who, who did he sleep with after you? I don't know. He kind of kept that information from me. Look. I really need to go. - No... 5 more minutes. - No. I can't. I'm sorry. I really need this job. So, if I came by tomorrow morning, at say, 10, we could go to Riverside Heights? Did you see a beige handbag? Oh... Damn. My keys are in there. So, Karen, tomorrow? Yeah, 10. That's fine. - Good luck on your interview. - Please God. Oh, hey... How did it go with Karen? Was she able to help? Well, I think so. She did know all about Tony's affairs. And so tomorrow, we're gonna go to Riverside Heights and look for some bartender that Tony was really friendly with. Oh! You know, would you give me, um, a few minutes to return a phone call about that fashion show and then you can tell me all about it? Okay. It looks like Karen's running her big mouth. If you wanna share this fortune with me, we're going to have to find a way to shut her up. So what do you want me to do? I want you to take care of this problem. This wasn't part of the plan, Claire. Well, it is now. - Good evening. - Thank you. Hey, Claire? What do your friends know about me? Oh, don't worry. Jason doesn't have many old friends. - It's mostly business colleagues. - Coming? Sure. Come on. That's really terrific. I'd like to propose a toast. - To my handsome husband. - Here. Here. I want to thank you all for being here tonight. It's a great honour that you could be with us. Thank you. Thank you. Cheers. Happy birthday Jason. Mm. Lovely choice of wine. - I'm glad you like it. - Ken, tell me. How's your campaign? Ken, what will the hot-button issue for your campaign be? Well the public seems to be crying for an even tougher 3 strikes law. I want to plug all the loopholes in the current law and send anyone who commits 3 felonies, any 3, to prison for 25 to life. Do we have enough space to house them? Yeah, build more prisons, right? And they shouldn't be country clubs. I don't think any prison is a country club. I think when a person is being punished, they should be punished. Well, that's not fair. The nature of the 3rd crime should be considered. Well, no felony is unimportant, June, but for the law to work, there can't be exceptions. - You couldn't build enough prisons. - I disagree. Most crimes are committed by a small number of habitual criminals. Lock them up, crime rate goes down. Exactly. Numbers don't lie. Habitual criminals, they don't belong with the rest of us. It's as simple as that. What do you think, Maggie? Well, the way I look at it. If you already have 2 felonies on your record, chances are you've committed many more and gotten away with them. So no matter what the 3rd one is, you deserve to be behind bars. That's ridiculous, Maggie! Why don't we just change the subject? I'm, I'm, I'm sorry. Uh... I'm not feeling very well. Please, excuse me. Ah... Would you please excuse me? Of course. Come back soon. Are you okay? They're so smug, Claire. They don't have a clue what they're talking about. I know. I know, sweetie, but you got to be more careful around Jason and his friends. I-I-I messed up. I'm... I'm sorry. Well, let's just go back to the table. Well, I'd, I'd, I'd rather not. I just... I'm gonna take a cab home. - Oh, we'll talk about something else. - Please! I... I just don't want to. Okay. - Thanks. - Well, sure. the research fund by 2 million... - It's great to have you on the show. - It's great to be here. I'm so excited. I can't believe it. I've got you on the show. Jason? I just wanted to apologize for what happened tonight. Well, I certainly appreciate the sentiment, June. He's just tired, Junie. Get some sleep. It was an embarrassment, Claire. I'm not taking her anywhere again, ever. She wasn't ready yet, honey. She tried to apologize. Claire, Do you really believe, in your heart of hearts, that June didn't kill Tony? I believe she thinks she didn't. Well, I'm not comforted. We're living in a halfway house for killers. - Oh, relax, honey. - Mmm... Everything will be okay. I'll wait. Hey, don't be nervous. No, I'm... It's not just that. I just, I don't... I just feel out of sorts. I'll be alright. Pushing for the sales tax... Karen! ...for the city's longest-ever grocery worker walkout. A spokesman for the union said that the 2 sides were still... Karen?! That they put forward several new proposals yesterday, including the idea... Karen? It's June! However, the union dismissed this, saying, quote... The front door was open. So I just came in. The 2 sides are scheduled to resume negotiations on Wednesday. Now, the story we mentioned at the top... Remember? I said I'd come by this morning?! Oh! You happy now, Claire? You did a very... very good job. Mmm. Mm... It was only a matter of time before crazy Karen did it to herself anyway. Last night was perfect. June completely lost it in front of everyone and Jason was so upset he just wanted to crawl under the table and hide. - Mm. - Mm. - Not much longer. - Mm-hm. Only just you and me. - And enough money to live happily ever after. - Yeah... Very... Very happily. Oh God, God... I got it, June. I got it. - Oh... - Are you alright? Yeah. Yes. It's just, I'm uh... It'll be okay. I mean I'm fine. Everything will be fine. Uh, Where's my sister? She went shopping for a few hours. Okay. Er, thank you. Don't you want to come down for dinner? We've got pasta. Uh, no. Thanks. I'm not... I'm not hungry. Look. I know you're upset about Karen, - but you got to eat. - No. I... It's not just that. I mean, that... that's terrible. It's awful. It's just I... Um... I felt really strange. All day. I'm... I don't know. Maybe I should just take... Maybe I should take 2 pills instead of 1 and maybe that'll help. Mm... Um... Hello? Hold on to your hat. I just got off the phone with that P.I. And you're gonna be happy. Now you'll have a real pro looking into this. - Oh! That-that-that's great. - She wants 500 bucks. - Okay. - Got some paper? Yeah. Let me just um... I've got something to write right here. Hold on. Okay? Her name is Diane DiSalvo. How's that? Ah, that's great. This is really wonderful, Charlie. Thank you. - I'll see you tomorrow at noon. - Okay. Bye. Good news? Yeah, I've got an appointment tomorrow at noon with a private investigator. She's a good friend of Charlie's and she convinced her to take my case. Really? What's her name? Uh... DiSalvo. Diane DiSalvo. Hm... Well, from what I've heard, private investigators tend to be expensive and a little on the shady side. Well, I only have to come up with 500$. 500$? For what? Ah, June's hiring a private detective. Come on. Dinner is ready. Well... Could I just borrow the 500 from you? And then, I promise I'll pay you back as soon as I start working. Of course. Unless, it's gonna cause problems between you and Jason. It's a way for me to be involved. Whatever you need, for you and Sammy. Okay. Thanks. Oh... Okay. Okay. It's all here. I've done this a hundred times. You okay? Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep last night. And I guess I didn't hear my alarm. It's okay. We'll make it up on the road. What's another speeding ticket, right? Oh... Nick, it's me. What are you doing? Working. You know, that thing some of us have to do. This DiSalvo thing has me worried. I had no idea she'd be so damned determined. Oh, listen. These two-bit P.I.'s run a few Internet searches and then take their checks to the bank. What if this one becomes a problem? Are you sure she's good? The best. And she's my friend Victor's cousin, so she's giving you a good deal. You'll love her, I promise. - Hey, how you doing, Charlie? - Hey. - Hey... - Hi. - I'm Victor. - Hi. - Charlie. Hey, this is my friend June Baldwin. - Diane DiSalvo. - Hi, Diane. Listen, Charlie. When are you gonna come out to the lake house and go fishing with me? When they stop selling fish at the grocery store. Come on. It's gonna be fun. You can bring your friend. What do you say? Victor was just leaving. Yeah. Got to go. Bye. Come on in. Is this everything you've got on the case? Yes. So um... Let me get this straight. Who else did the cops investigate as a possible suspect? Uh... no one. Did they catch you bashing your husband's head in? No. I, I mean, of course not. So what that means is, after you ran into the night screaming like a banshee, somebody came in afterward and did the job. Any ideas? No. Uh, not really. But everything that I remember from my meeting with Karen - is in there as well. - Karen? Remember? I told you about the secretary who'd been found dead. Oh yeah... Her rendezvous point somewhere in Riverside Heights. No photo of your husband in that file. I'll need one. Claire, you wouldn't happen to have a photo of Tony, would you? I'm sure I do. Why on earth would you want one? Well, Charlie's gonna drop one off at the detective's office. Oh. Uh, let's go look. Charlie, just make yourself at home. We'll be right back. Hello, Charlie. Uh, Hi. Where's June? - Uh, upstairs. - Ah... We have it! Oh... Hi, sweetheart. Thanks, Charlie. I, uh, better be on my way. Always seem to be running late. I'll call you later. You 2 spend a lot of time together. Yes, she's helping me. So you spend your days hanging out with another ex-con so you can prove that you didn't really murder your husband. In a nutshell. That's not what I agreed to, Claire! She was supposed to stay with us until she got back on her feet. And that was it. There was nothing in our agreement about hiring detectives or allowing felons to prowl around my house unattended! Claire invited her in! Why are you so paranoid?! Don't worry, Jason. I won't kill you. Very funny. Trust me. I'll be ready to move out soon. Um, Megan... I'm going to put some money in the envelope for this month's expenses. If you could just, uh, pick up Jason's dry cleaning? Sure. Mrs. Givens. So it's been 3 days since you and Jason had it out? - Yeah. - He's still holding a grudge? And we don't say a word to each other. I know it's stressful there. You're welcome to stay with me. Thank you, but I have to stick it out. Sammy is coming home soon and I don't wanna disrupt his routine. I can get you a different cup. No, it's fine. Diane calls every day and she still has not found that bartender. Diane is very good at what she does. I've known her and Victor for years. If anyone can find this guy, she can. You can put that over on the right side. Next to the pool. - Hi. - Hi. - Nick. Landscaper. - Hi. - Hey. - I'm June, Claire's sister. - Oh, nice to meet you, June. - You too. Bye. You okay? What happened? I don't understand it, Claire. I feel like I'm losing it. Like I'm really losing it. Junie... I'm glad you brought this up because Jason and I are a little worried about how you've been acting lately. Maybe it's just a combination of things: getting out of jail and readjusting, the issues with Jason, Sammy coming home soon, Karen's death, everything. And it's understandable. But given your history, I think maybe we should re-examine your medication. Maybe. Why don't you let me make an appointment for you with a doctor I know? A psychiatrist. And you can discuss all of this with her. - Another doctor? - Her name is Doctor Yardley and she's one of the best in Philadelphia. Okay. I... It's worth a shot, I guess, right? - Hello? - Hi, this is Diane DiSalvo. Is June there? Just a moment. It's for you. It's Diane DiSalvo. Hello? - June, I've got some news finally. - What is it? Well, I spent the last 3 days trying to find this bar in Riverside Heights. The one where the bartender was chummy with Tony. Yeah? After going on a bunch of wild goose chases, I finally found it. The name was changed to Morgan's Pub a few years ago. Anyway, one of the waitresses there remembers Tony - and the bartender named Greg. - Okay. Long story short, Greg was fired, turns out he's working over at the Mayfair Theatre. I called over there and sure enough he's the assistant manager. Oh, that's terrific news. So he doesn't start 'til 2 but uh, I'm gonna go over there and pay him a visit and see what he remembers about Tony. - Thank you. Thank you so much. - Bye for now. Bye. Maybe this day isn't so bad after all. DiSalvo found the bartender that Tony knew! - Mhm. - I'm gonna go tell Charlie! Okay. What's up? That bitch P.I. she hired actually found that bartender Greg. He used to be friends with Tony. Ugh... From the way you said it, that sounds bad. Very bad. We need to make sure she doesn't learn anything important. She's going to be at the Mayfair Theatre today at 2. I don't like these little snags. But listen, we've only got a few more days left and it'll all be over. I know, but this Greg guy has a big mouth. And if she asks the right questions, it could end up being more than just a snag. Next show's not for another half hour. No, I just want to ask you something. Do you... Remember this guy? Yeah. Yeah, I remember Tony. Fun guy. Too bad he got murdered by that crazy wife of his. I guess she got tired of him coming home smellin' like cheap perfume. Any of these women come to mind? I mean I heard there were quite a few. Well mostly were one night stands, you know, one-nighters. In and out in a blink. Man, I don't remember any names, but uh... There was this super sexy brunette with an accent. I mean, 1 or 2 coulda been hookers. You know, sometimes it's hard to tell. Oh yeah! There was this really high-class one who got her sports car all smashed up. - Her sports car? - Yeah, yeah. A real rich type, you know? She was with him right before his wife killed him. This broad comes in with him one night, right? And, uh, they had a fight. Anyway, they'd been arguing about something. And then she leaves in a big sweat. And uh, next thing I know, there's a big crash. In the parking lot of the bar? Yeah. So I go out. I walk outside. And there she is. She's standing beside her expensive red convertible. Right? And except the hood has been caved in by some piece a crap clunker driven by one of the drunks who had, you know, walked out a minute before. So she's screaming her head off, you know? She's using words that I've never heard from a female before. Anyway, cops come in, arrest the guy, DUI. She just took a cab home I guess. When'd this happen? I don't know. I assume it was... One of the last times that Tony came in. So uh... Oh, a few days before his old lady whacked him. - Thank you very much. - Anytime. - Thanks again. - No worries. Hey, next show's not 'til 3:15. Already seen it. I'm here for something else. The woman that just walked out of here, I'm guessing that conversation's for sale. Come in, yeah. Hi! Doctor Yardley's office please? This is Doctor Yardley's office. Yes, I wanted to confirm an appointment I made for Wednesday afternoon. Can I have your name, please? Uh, yes. June Baldwin. I set it about a month ago. - At what time? - It's um... 5:30? Oh, yeah. We have you down. See you then. Thank you. Great. Come on! Pass the ball, let's go. Yeah. Nice pass. Good job. - Nice try. - Hurry, hit it. Yeah. - Hello? - Hey, it's me, Diane. Listen. I talked to that Greg guy over at the Mayfair Theatre. And I can't give you the details now but I'm on to something. Something big. Really? Yeah. So June... I hope to have some good news for you real soon. Just hang in there. Okay? - Okay. - Bye. - Thanks, Diane. - Okay. Claire, I'm positive. He said he didn't know her name, but she was a real high-class broad. She knows about the car accident? That's what he said. I need to see you right away. Okay. - It was you, wasn't it? - What are you talking about? The woman with the shiny red convertible. Good old Greg described you to a tee. You were having an affair with your sister's husband. He was blackmailing me! Really? He found out that I was seeing Jason and he knew he had money. Tony seduced me. - He seduced you? - Yes! And then he threatened to tell Jason. He wanted 50 thousand dollars. It was the night I was supposed to pay him half. I called Tony and overheard them fighting. It sounded violent. I didn't know what had happened. So I decided to go over there. Tony? Oh... Oh God that hurts. Oh... She hit me. Oh, that bitch sister of yours. She kidnapped Sammy. One thing about June, she was never good at finishing things. It was that simple. I never thought I'd have it in me to kill someone, but you know... It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. We are 24 hours away, Nick. Jason's poker game is set for tomorrow. I got June a doctor's appointment at the perfect time. And my dinner with those goody two-shoe charity women is confirmed. We are so close. But if DiSalvo finds out that I was seeing Tony, it'll be all over. And we can kiss Jason's millions goodbye. I thought you said our plan was airtight, Claire. It is. June is falling apart without her medication. She and Jason are fighting all the time. And everyone, including our housekeeper, has seen her acting completely crazy. It'll all work out. I'll make sure it does. Are you sure you didn't just use some and forget to put the receipt in here? No. I pulled out some for groceries and dry cleaning - but not that much. - Honey? I took some out to pay the gardener but there was over a thousand a few days ago. Well, somebody must have taken it. With all the criminals in the house lately, it wouldn't - surprise me if it was stolen. - What? Are you accusing me? There is money missing from petty cash. - Do you know what happened to it? - No, of course not! - Come on. She didn't take it. - Well, I don't know what happened to it, but it's gone. Money just doesn't just disappear by itself. You are unbelievable, Jason! - No, I didn't steal any money. - I'm just stating facts. Both of you, please. This is very confusing. We don't even know how much is gone. That is not the point! The point is that I am tired of Jason treating me like some sort of a lowlife criminal! You are a criminal! You know, I don't give a damn what you think, Jason! I don't care what anyone thinks! Yeah, well, you should. You know why, June? Because you've been acting like a lunatic ever since you got here. It gets worse and worse everyday! I don't think you're capable of raising Sammy anymore. - June, stop. - I didn't do it, Claire. - Please, Okay. Okay. Just wait. - I didn't do it! I don't know what's happening to me, Claire. Just calm down. I've made your appointment with Dr. Yardley for tomorrow. We'll get you started on some new medication. Sammy's coming back next week. It'll all be fine. I just, I can't... I can't deal with him treating me like I am just a... worthless piece of trash. Well, you let me handle Jason. This is stressful for him too. Besides, he's been good to your son. He's given Sammy everything. Anything that boy's needed, he's gotten. Okay. Alright, I'm sorry, Claire. I'm sorry. It's okay. Oh... Don't worry. Everything will get much better. I promise. We're almost there, Nick. I just want to make sure you have the keys to the house and the gun cabinet. Yeah, I got 'em. Okay. Good luck. Honey, don't forget. I'm having dinner with Nancy and the ladies tonight. You are? Yes, I told you about it weeks ago. We're planning a charity fashion show. So I won't be here to fix snacks for you and the boys during poker but Megan said she'd do it before she leaves. No problem. And I picked up a case of beer at the grocery store. - Mhm. - Thanks, Megan. Okay, sweetie, bye. Have fun with the girls tonight. - Thanks. And Jason... - Mhm? Please don't get in a fight with June while I'm gone. Oh hey, Claire? Are you gonna be around tonight? No, no, I'm not, but your doctor's appointment is at 5:30 and I wanted to give you money for a cab. No, that's okay. I told Charlie that I'd go with her to look for a new car and she's gonna drop me off at Dr. Yardley's. I'll just take the bus back. Are you kidding? It's all the way across town. A cab is much safer. - Er... - Besides, I don't want to be worrying about you standing - at some bus stop all night. - Okay. I think that's Charlie. I-I'll see you later. Okay. Okay... This is the place. Oh, it's Victor. Hello? Charlie, it's Diane, she's dead. - Oh my God. - They found her this morning. The police say she was stabbed in what looks like a robbery. Victor, I'm so sorry. Yeah, yeah, I know. Me too. Can you hold on? It's... it's the other line. It might be the police. DiSalvo was found dead in her car this morning. What? What happened? A mugging or a robbery or something. Oh my God. - Wh... - Look. You should go. I'll call you later and let you know what's happening. Okay. Uh... Oh my God. Are you sure you're okay, June? Yeah. Yeah... Um... I just uh... I-I-I feel like all my old symptoms are back. You know, um... Worse... worse than ever like before I even started taking the Proladine. Do you find that your thoughts are almost racing through your mind? Yes. Exactly. I-I forget things... I get angry all the time. How have long you been feeling like this? Since you got out? Actually, I-I-I felt pretty good when I was first released. And then... uh, everything went just downhill. Right. First thing we do is change your medication. Now, I know you like the Proladine, but there's a brand new one on the market, called Perladex. I have a sample here I'd like you to get started with. Take 2 right away to get your system back on track. And then take one every 24 hours. I'm also gonna write you a prescription. and we'll see how you do with that, okay? Oh my God. Jason... We'll bring in at least 30 thousand from the silent auction. And we're looking at a net of about 70 thousand if we sell out the event. Cheers. Jason, come on man, open the door! I'm feeling lucky. Anybody home? Jayce? Oh my God. Call an ambulance! - Hey, June. - Charlie! Jason's dead. Somebody killed him. I think that they're framing me again. Somebody chloroformed me. I-I-I woke up and he was dead! Whoa, slow down. Where the hell are you? Uh... I... I-I-I see the... The gas station at the intersection of Maple and Vine. Okay. I can be there in a half hour, maybe less. The gun, Charlie... When I woke up it was in my hand! My prints are probably all over it! Okay, okay! Just calm down. We're gonna figure this out. I saw people coming into the house. I mean, I-I-I heard them. They were Jason's friends. I think they saw me! There was the gun in my hand and he was dead! Okay! We just need a safe place to think things out. Wait. I know, I know. - Who are you calling? - Victor. Anyone that knows me can see that I am the perfect patsy. Not only that... You talked to the shrink about being prone to violence. And then, there was that party you walked out of on Jason's birthday. I know, I know. It's the ideal set up. All roads lead back to me. Well with the uh... With the fights and... Jason's accusations about the missing money this morning, it uh... it doesn't look good. But if Charlie says you're innocent... I believe her. Since I didn't do it, the question is who did? Did he have a lot of enemies? According to Claire, he had a reputation for being a ruthless businessman, so I'm guessing the answer is yes. Okay. Okay. So... let's rephrase that then. Who would benefit most from his death? I'd say... Jason's wife. Claire?! How much will she inherit? She's my sister?! She... No... It... I uh... That's ludicrous. Hey, follow the money they always say, right? No... No... Claire couldn't do this to me... June... Jason was rich, very rich. Let's say for argument's sake that Claire had something to do with it. Framing you would be the perfect thing to do. Well, it certainly makes the case against me very strong since I've already been convicted of killing Tony. Claire knew the progress my cousin was making, right? Yes, I always told Claire everything. And your cousin Diane was killed right after she found out something important from that guy Greg. That's a pretty weird coincidence, don't you think? You know... I did tell Claire that Diane had something important to tell me. Wait... Hold on. Hold on. Let's just focus on this for a second. Now, what did this guy Greg say to my cousin? That's what I have to find out. Oh, not you. Me. The cops are already looking for you. Charlie too, I'll bet. I'll go down to the theatre tomorrow as soon as it opens. What happened? Wh... what's going on? You can't go in there. It's Jason. Oh my God. Oh my God. Hey... Can't sleep? I can't believe that Claire would do this to me. She was always defending me, you know? I always felt like she was in my corner. June... I don't know why people do the things they do. But we're not gonna stop until everyone knows that you didn't kill Jason or Tony. You're a good friend, Charlie. So are you. Hey, man! I'm looking for Greg. Who wants to know? I wanna ask him some questions about Tony Baldwin. You know what? You're the third person coming here asking for him. That bastard's more popular dead than he was alive. - Third, huh? - Yeah... Who would've thought knowing Tony Baldwin could be so profitable? Yeah, right. So who was asking? Some broad. Short, skinny. And then some guy came right afterward wanting to know exactly what I told her. - What did this guy look like? - Uh... Kinda tall, uh... Sandy hair, I don't know. Alright. Alright. Why don't you just tell me what you told the others about Tony Baldwin? Red convertible?! Claire had a red convertible right before Tony was killed. And a guy? Tall, sandy hair, grey truck... It-it sounds like the guy that was at the house. - Who? - Claire's landscaper, Nick. He has the sign on the side of his truck, a grey truck. It was parked in the driveway when you dropped me off - at Claire's house the other day. - You're right. Things are starting to fall into place. At least now, we can connect this Nick guy to Claire. I was really hoping that we were wrong. That it wasn't her. And with a sister like that, you don't need too many enemies. Even if we can show that Nick knew that Claire and Tony were having an affair, we still don't have enough to go to the police. It doesn't prove that Claire killed Jason and Tony. You're right. I need something more. Wait... Maybe there is something we can do. - June... - Hi, Claire. My God! What are you doing? Why the gun? Is it distracting? I thought it might convey how unhappy I am. Junie, are you off your medication? Doctor Yardley took care of that. Cut the act, Claire. I don't know what you're talking about. You and I are going to have a heart-to-heart. I did my homework and I know everything. You've got me completely confused here. I know about you and Tony. I know about the affair. I know about your fender bender in the parking lot of the bar. And I know that you and Nick framed me for Jason's murder. You're crazy, June. I wasn't seeing Tony and I had nothing to do with his death. Or Jason's. That's not what Greg said. Do you remember him? Tony's friend, the bartender? I have him on tape saying that your landscaper was there asking questions right after Diane DiSalvo. And it's starting to look like you had something to do with her untimely death as well. You're insane. Maybe. But it's better than being guilty. If this is all so neat and clean, why didn't you just go to the police with your little fantasy? And turn in my own sister? We're blood, Claire. What do you want, June? I would like to know why you have done this to me, but that's for another time. Right now, what I need is your cooperation. - With what? - My plan. You and I are gonna become partners. I want Sammy to have the life that he deserves. This life, your life. I could never give him that on my own. It's simple. Nick takes the fall for Jason's death all alone and you split half of your inheritance with me so that Sammy and I can live happily ever after. That's ridiculous, June. It'll never work. That's why we have to kill him. I thought that might hit a nerve. I have the feeling that the 2 of you are more than just friends. I thought so. Tomorrow night, you call Nick and tell him to come to the house. You tell the police he came in while you were asleep. Say he raped you. He had been obsessing over you for months. He told you that he killed Jason and framed me so that the 2 of you could be together. Claire?! You had no choice. You had to kill him; it was self-defense. We'll plant a few of your photos and intimate items, things that he stole from the house while he was working in the yard. And that way, the police will never question his delusional and obsessive crush. Then I'm off the hook for Jason's death and you still inherit all of this. Well, at least half of it. I don't know what your game is here. But I don't believe you, June, you're not the type. I am tired of being a victim, Claire. I did it with Tony and I did it with you. I went to prison for 8 years. I'm due. Call it restitution. It's your choice. Half of all of this... Or a 6 by 9 cell all to yourself for the rest of your life. How are you gonna plant the stuff in Nick's townhouse? I'm sure you have a key to his place. If you don't, you'll get one. Then you'll bring me the key and a collection of the items that he stole. And as soon as he leaves to come here, I will go there and plant them. And by the time you manage to save yourself from his vicious attack, I will be long gone. Once Nick's buried and everything is settled, I'll contact you. Where should we meet tomorrow? At the stadium on Sauter Road at the south gate. Be there at 8. Set your date with Nick for 9. - Nick, it's me. - Hey, gorgeous. I need to see you tonight. I know why you picked this place. Dad brought us here when we were little to watch those old club football games. And do you remember the time when he sent you and I down here to get the hot dogs and soda? And you fell and everyone thought that you broke your leg. You screamed in pain. And I was so scared and I ran back upstairs to get Dad, to bring him down here. I remember it all, June. So what? You didn't break your leg, Claire. The doctor said it wasn't even sprained. What is this? Time to reveal all the mysteries? Are you dying to know what my motivation was for ruining your life? Did you think that if I came here, I would get lost in a reverie and tell you what you did that made me hate you? - Why do you hate me? - I didn't always, but somewhere between everybody fawning all over you because you couldn't take care of yourself and doing cartwheels to keep you from getting depressed, I got a little sick of it! You were jealous. No, I just wanted a normal sister. Like everyone else. I didn't plan on framing you. I thought that all your fragility would finally pay off and you'd get away with a slap on the wrist. 8 years, Claire! Yeah, 8 years, June. And if you hadn't spent them in prison, you would have spent them being beat up by Tony every night. Don't blame me. You've always been the victim. It's the only role you know. Where are the keys to Nick's place? We ran into a little snag with that. Did you really think I'd give you half my money? I worked hard for that, Junie. Living with Jason is no easy task. We both worked hard for this. A fourth murder? You will never get away with it. Who said it's murder? You're a little unbalanced, June. A little erratic. And with the added stress of trying to outrun the law, well, you'd rather kill yourself than go back to prison. It was very impulsive. No good-byes... Just walked to the edge of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge and threw yourself in the Delaware. Swept downstream. Tragic. Sammy will be disappointed at first, but we'll find a good family for him. Well, June. It was nice to meet you. I wouldn't do that! I thought you might do this, Claire. And we just needed proof. It's all right here. Sammy will be disappointed at first, but we'll find a good family for him. It's over, Claire. It's over. You won't shoot me, June. Claire... I can't go to prison, June. I can't. 911, what's your emergency? I need an ambulance and the police. - Where are you, ma'am? - The stadium, south gate. Help is on the way. So have you talked to her since the arrest? Claire's on her own now. I don't think I'm ever gonna want to see her again. I could never live this far out in the middle of nowhere. It's a 20-minute drive just for a pizza. - I know. It's wonderful. - Hey, Mom! - Look what I caught! - Let me see! Let me see! Wow! Is that blue gill? It's trout. The lake's full of 'em. Looks like fish and chips for dinner. Victor said next weekend I can go out on the boat with him and we can catch really big fish. Really?! Well, you know, deer season's coming up. It gets pretty busy. I could use a partner. Mom, can I be his partner please? Alright, Caain Ahab. Let's get this cleaned up and get that fish smell off of you. Alright. - Let's go. - Let's go. Well... you know, if you leave now, you're gonna miss the best part of the year. Well, how long do I have to decide? As much time as you need.
