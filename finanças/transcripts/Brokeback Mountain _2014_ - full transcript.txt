Goddamn ranch kids! Late! I said 'be here at ten-thirty sharp. Monday morning.' Ten minutes late. If they ain't here by eleven. God knows where I'll find men to take their place. Maybe they heard something about that mountain. Maybe they won't show. Brokeback mountain, old and hard, knife blade rising from the earth. Dark power. Lightning, blizzard, avalanche and flood, storm and falling rock, stones like skulls, jet stream, lion's claw. An evil place that kills men. You! Never keep me waiting! Are you Jack Twist or Ennis Del Mar? I'm Jack. All-around hand, rodeo bull-rider, and now a sheep herder, I guess. Just for the summer. Where's the other one, this Del Mar? Somebody's coming. Maybe it's him. You Del Mar? Didn't you hear me? You deaf? Speak up! - Yeah! Ennis del Mar! - You watch your step, mister. This here is Jack's the herder. Del Mar, you are the camp tender. Here's my rules. Break them and you're fired. Two camps. The main camp where the Forest Service says. Keep the fire small. Herder in the high camp with the sheep. Watch out for coyotes. Watch out for Forest Service. Every night. No fire up there! Kill every coyote. Kill every mountain lion. Kill every fox. Kill every eagle. Kill everything that kills a sheep. No whiskey. No women. No fights. No going to town. No butchering sheep. Got it? Yeah, got it, Mr. Aguirre. A to Z. - Speak up! - Yeah! Got it! Come back here at one o'clock. You go to the mountain. How about a beer? We got time to kill. Pretty good place. Two drafts. And a shot. - Where you from? - Sage. Wyoming. Never heard of it. I'm from Lightnin Flats. Wyoming. Never heard of it. My folks got a ranch near the Montana line. I had to get out. - Your folks ranch people? - They was. Died in a car wreck. Sister raised me. Quit school to work and working ever since. Army didn't get you? They can't get no use out of me. Bad knees, busted ribs. Left leg busted three times. They can't get no use out of me. - You got a girl? - Alma. - You? - Not right now. I hit a run of bad luck, lost my truck. I'm broke. This sheep job will let me save money. I'm saving up too. Me and Alma's getting married. Start a horse ranch, maybe. You guys working for Aguirre? Up on Brokeback? Just for the summer. You want to bring plenty a whiskey. It's a bad mountain. I seen crazy men come down... end of the summer. Isolation. Aguirre don't let nobody take a day off. Stay up with the sheep and the wind you go crazy. Isolation. He already told us his rules. 'No whiskey' is one a them. What he don't know won't hurt him. - Make it two. - Each. What's for supper tonight, Hamburgers and onions? Pork chops? Fried chicken? Sirloin steaks? Canned spaghetti. Not again. You burn it this time? Sure wish we could go to town, have a good dinner, get drunk at that bar, tie one on. Talk to people. You don't talk much. - Get laid. - Dream on. Anyways, I ain't much of a talker. Today I seen a wolf or the biggest coyote in the world. Big as a cow. I shot at him twice. - Get it? - Missed both times Coyote. Wolves is all wiped out. I hate to go back to that damn little tent. See you tomorrow. See you. Pretty lonesome down here. Dark. Moon ain't up yet. I can see his fire. Wish I was down there. No fire up here. Aguirre says. No whiskey. Aguirre says. Here's to you, Aguirre. Quiet. I don't hear no wolves now. Might as well sleep as sit in the dark. I can see his fire. Wolves got two sheep last night. I can't shoot 'em if it's dark and I can't see 'em. Coyotes. Wolves is wiped out. I am traveling four hours a day. Come in for breakfast. Go back to the sheep. Come in for supper. Go back to the sheep. - All night looking for wolves. - Coyotes. I should be staying here. All night. In the main camp. Aguirre got no right to make me do this. You want to stay here? I wouldn't mind sleeping up there. That makes no point. We should both be in this camp. We'll switch. You cook breakfast. Can't be no worse than me. See you tomorrow. I know it's your favorite dish, but don't expect no burned toast! Shot one this morning at first light. Big son of a bitch. Big as a wolf. But he's a coyote. How about a drink to celebrate? I wanted to be a champion bull rider. That was my boyhood dream. But I always known I had to get away. I always known I was going to leave. From my window. I could see a blue mountain. Hundred miles away. It was Brokeback Mountain. I saw it shake with storm. I always known this mountain. And now I'm here. - Your folks religious? - They was. Yours? My mama's Pentecostal. She walks with Jesus. My old man don't walk with no one. Your folks treat you O.K. when you was a kid? Pretty much. Yours? My old man beat me black and blue... ...until I was big enough to fight back. He don't mess with me now about nothing. Pass me that bottle. It's pretty nice up here, ain't it? Like we're on another world. The old world is way down there. Starry nights. We looked then on them hawks We look down on them pine trees. We're like eagles. This eagle could eat some of them potatoes. They probably ain't done. - Who the hell cares. - I do. Another few minutes, O.K.? Sounds like that hawk is saying "You are free." Up here we free. I ever tell you how I come to get into bull-riding? - Yeah. - My dad never showed me a thing. He never once come to see me ride. Yeah. You told me. God Damn! Them potatoes is burned. Guess we drink whiskey for supper. Fine with me. Moon's coming up. You must be drunk. I know I am. Too drunk to go up there. I'll sleep by the fire. That ain't smart. Come in the tent. Plenty of room. I'll ride out at first light... Have it your own way. Freeze! Freezing! Cold to the bone! Ice in my veins. Freezing cold. So cold. Got on in here! Who am I now? He was drunk. - What happened seemed right. - And so was I. - Our bodies are not different. - But it was more than quick sex. There was something more. Something wild and special. - But I know it's wrong. - He's got feelings for me. He calms me, he touches me. - He heals my loneliness. - A kind of tenderness for me. But who am I now? It can't happen again. I'm going to marry Alma. Have children. Raise a family. - What happened seemed right. - He could be The Someone for me. But it won't happen again. I'll ride away tonight, under the moon. He calms me, close to me. But it can't happen again. We got to talk about last night. You better know something. I ain't no queer. Me neither. But I'm not sorry we done it. - Are you? - I can't talk about this! Damn you! I'm going to marry Alma! Alma, now try this one. That's one of our bridesmaid dresses. This is a bridal gown. We're only ranch people. That's a lot of money for us. It's on sale. And it's a girl's Big Day. Try it on. Is she marrying a local boy? A nice young man. Ennis Del Mar. What is his profession? Is he a lawyer? The son of a rancher? College student? Does he work for the state? Will they live in town? He comes from ranch people. Like us. This is the one I want. I will marry Ennis in this dress. Only a few more months now... ...after he comes down from that mountain. - Just lovely on you. The perfect bride! - I don't know. I want this dress. I wish I had a camera to take her picture. - And you won't get it cheaper. - I don't know. - It'll take all the money I've got - I want this dress! Please, Mama. - I'll throw in a veil. - It's a lot of money. You want to do the right thing for your girl. That was for new tires for Dad's truck. - I got to have that dress. - This was for the vet's bill. This was for new jeans for the boys. I wish you a sunny wedding day. That was embarrassing. What was wrong with the first dress? - It was only forty-five dollars. - It was ugly. I want something nice. For the start of my new life. Mrs. Ennis Del Mar. For my escape from the ranch. That ranch has supported you for eighteen years. I sure didn't pick to live there. I hate it! I want to live in town. I want to have a princess phone. How does Ennis feel about town? He wants his own ranch. He wants to raise horses. On that we don't see eye to eye. I will change his mind. - He will give in. - You'll find out. You can take the boy out of the country. You wait and see. I won't get stuck on any ranch It's late. Come on. I grew up on that ranch, seven boys and me. Men get to be the heroes. Women pay the bills. Cook for roundups. Dishes three times a day. Tend the garden. Can tomatoes, dig potatoes. Chickens, eggs! Blizzards and mud. Laundry for ten and then start again. And who gets the ranch? Not the worn-out wife. The oldest boy inherits it all. That's a life I am leaving. Alma! Time to hit the hay, cowboy. And I can't stay down here tonight. I got to go back up to the sheep. Ain't you sleepy? You know I got to go. I hear his heart beating. I don't want to go. I feel his warmth. - Why can't we be face to face? - We can't be face to face. - Why can't it be like this for us? - That would mean something bad. - I hear his heart beat for me. - This is wrong. What's happening to me? You calm me. You heal the ache of loneliness. Close to me. You calm me. I think you love me, Ennis. No! No! Those soft words are not mine. You don't calm me. Your closeness scares me. You disturb me. I cannot let you close to me. You scare me. Whitlaw calls me up and says you got my sheep mixed up with his. I go up to the high camp. Nobody there. I look down. I see something I should not see. Then don't spy. You won't see the things you should not see. One a you get up to them sheep. Right Now. Supposed to be one of you up there every night. Not down here. All right. Tomorrow. I got to get my sheep down the mountain. Weather coming. Storm moving in. First snow on the way. Tomorrow we get the sheep down. Six a.m. And that'll be it for you two. Pick up your checks at the trailer. And get the hell away from here. Away from me. This goddamn mountain... I better get up there, I guess. Goddamn, Ennis. Think about it. This is our last night. Stay here. Jack, I better go. Ennis. Don't you go up to them damn sheep. You're right. I'm staying. Come on. It's over, ain't it! It's over. - It can't be over. - Seems like it is, Jack. Can't we work something out? You and me something work out. My folks' place, get it into shape? Build a little cabin? Jack, I got to live a regular life. Alma's waiting for me. Find a job. Like you just said, this is over. It's got to be over. I hear you talking. But real life ain't talk. You and me been together all summer. And I know that whatever you talk, you loved what we done. Together. Son of a bitch! I told you, I ain't that way. I was there, Ennis. Jack! Jesus, I'm sorry, Jack. I guess that makes your point. It's over. Blood on my shirt. Where is my other shirt? Jack, I'm sorry. I feel like hell. Aguirre and his guys is coming up the trail. Jack, can you get your gear by yourself? - Yeah. - I'm sorry, Jack. - Yeah. - Well. See you around. Yeah. What do I do now? Back to Texas and the rodeo, I guess. Rodeo bullrider! Where do you find 'em? What happened to the guy that made dulcimers? And the sanger? He was the worst sanger in the world. Never saw him small once. He had a main disposition. This rodeo boy is puny. At least he ain't some kind a musician. And you want to give a job? He's smart, Daddy. And I like him. I know he's a little rough, but he can talk rodeo and ranch with anybody. He'll make ranchers feel big enough to buy a combine. He'll be a good salesman. Lord, I suppose love is bland. Not what I would a picked for my educated little gal. But I'll give him a job and we'll see, but don't you do nothing dumb like marrying the son of a bitch. Are you doing it with him? No, don't answer. I couldn't stand to know. Puny little weirdo. Get in here, boy. You little shit. I got to quit smoking. Where is he? I'm going to be late to work. Bill? It's Alma. I'm waiting for Ennis to get back and take care of the girls. As soon as he gets here. Yes. Well, that's how he is. He's coming in now. See you in ten minutes. What kept you so long? I'm late for work. Ah hell, I got in a fight with the new guy. I think I sprained my wrist. Always fighting. You need a different job A real job, not a ranch job. Baby needs changing and there's hot dogs in the ice box for supper. There's mail for you. On the bed. Dammit! Daddy's girls, pigtails and curls, Daddy's girls, rubies and pearls. Big sale at the feed store. Ain't that great. Telephone bill. I don't know why in hell we need a telephone. Water bill. On a ranch you got your own water. A letter from... Christ, it's from Jack Twist! “Friend this letter is a long time over due. Hope you get it, I'm coming thru on the 24th on my way to Cody Rodeo, will visit you and buy a shot of whiskey Drop me a line. Give your address. Your old Pal Jack" Twenty-fourth! That's next week. Dear Jack. I will sure be glad to see you again. Hurry up! It's so hot, let's take your friend to the diner. They got that big ceiling fan. Me and Jack will probably just go out and talk and get drunk. Four years is a long time since we was up on Brokeback chasing sheep. That's an animal I never want to see or smell again. And I'm supposed to sit here alone? Catch up on the ironing. Anyway, Jack ain't the restaurant type. That's him! Jack! It's you! Son of a bitch! Alma, this is Jack Twist, Jack, this is Alma. Me and Jack ain't seen each other in four years. Sure enough. You got a kid? Two little girls. Alma Jr. and Francine. Love them to pieces. I got a boy. Eight months old. Tell you what, I married a cute little old Texas girl, Lureen. Alma, me and Jack is going out. Get a drink. Might not get back tonight we get drinking and talkin. - Please to meet you. - Ennis. Stuck again. I never get loose. No fun, no breaks, just work and wait. He gets to go out with his friend. Jack. I thought this Jack would be a friend to both of us. But he hardly said a word. Didn't look at me. Didn't smile. No. No friend to me. I didn't know. Swear to God I didn't know that we was goin to get into this again. Yeah? The hell you didn't. Yeah, I knew. Why I'm here. Red-lined it all the way, couldn't drive fast enough. We got to talk. About everything. Four years! I didn't know where you was. Four years! I thought about you every day. Figured I'd never hear your voice again after four years. I figured you was sore about that time I punched you. I was. For about two days. I got back to rodeo. How I met Lureen. She went to college. Her old man's got money. I'm working for him. And he's sick. Anyways, after Cody I'm getting out of bull riding while I can still walk. You seem in pretty good shape to me. Rough and tough. Not bad yourself. Those four years I dreamed about you. I thought about you. Damn near went nuts thinking about you. Listen, we both got wives and kids, we got to work out what happens next. It's a problem. I never should have let you out of my sights. Old Brokeback got us good and it sure ain't over. Too late by the time I knew it. And now you are in Texas. Makes it worse. I'm nothing much, Jack. I'm not very smart. I'm in something way over my head. I don't know who the hell I am anymore. Since the mountain. Friend, we got us a fucking situation here. I don't know what we are going to do. Nothing we can do. Not now. Jack, I built up a life in them four years. Every time I heard a hawk cry I thought about us up on the mountain. They say Brokeback is a bad place. - But for us it was good. - I wish we never left there. What happened back at my place. If that grabs on us in the wrong place we'll be dead. - We can make something work. - You got some kind of power over me. You and that damn Brokeback. It done something to me. It scares me, how I feel. Jack, why do I have these feelings not for Alma but for you? Why do my hands shake, my breath come short? Why can't I say what I want to say? If we had us a little ranch somewhere, it could be a sweet life. I got some money saved up. We can do it. It ain't going to be that way. It can't. I am caught in my own loop. I goddamn hate it that you are goin to drive away in the mornin and I am going back to work. But if you can't fix it, you got to stand it. Jack, I wish we was up on the mountain again. Bad or good. I hate this motel room. I wish we was in the high country. Pure cold water. Wind blowing. The camp fire and the hawk below callin “Free, we are free." Close to you. Remember how them cloud shadows slid over us? I miss the smell of pine trees. Owls hooting. It wasn't all good, Mosquitoes. And remember that lightning storm? Hell yes! I thought we was done for. I thought God was after us. Never forget it. Smoke in your eyes. Burned toast. Aguirre. Let's do it. Get up in the mountains. Right now! Tonight! I'll throw off the rodeo. You call Alma. You owe me that much. Give me something to go on. Alma. I'm going to take off with Jack for a couple days. Go up and fish the high lakes. What? Just like that? What about me and the girls? Alma, since we got married I done everything you wanted except take a town job. We live in town and I hate that closed-in feeling. You got your fancy telephone which I don't never use. I give you every dollar I make. Right now I got to get outdoors away from this place and all. Your pay check don't cover much. And you are using that telephone you got no use for right this minute. I never should of married you. I wish to God you never did. Now what? Get your boots on and let's go. We can get there by first light. It's gonna be great. Alone in the mountains, just me and you way the hell out in the back of nowhere. Jack, this ain't no little thing that's happening here. We can do this a couple times a year, be alone. Out in the mountains. Me and you. This ain't no little thing that's happening here. Me and you. This ain't no little thing that's happening here. Hey Alma. Where are the girls? At Nana's. I asked her to take them tonight so I can talk to you. - What about? - About you getting a decent job. What I make at Bill's store don't hardly keep us. What you make don't hardly pay for the clothes you ruin. I want you to get out from ranch work. Bill's brother is high up with the power company... ...and there is an opening for a lineman. The pay is good, good benefits, they provide a uniform. Lineman! Uniform! Tell Jones to mind his own business. Why can't anybody leave me be? I like ranch work, I like livestock, I like horses. I told you that before we got married. You ever hear that money ain't everything? With you it ain't anything. The girls want the things their friends have. They're smart, and pretty soon they'll be in high school. Maybe go to college. Where's the money going to come from? I just walk in the house and you dump all this on me. You're all rested up from your nice fishing trip with your buddy, ain't you? Catch any fish? Must be nice, take a little weekend vacation. Seems like you go fishing pretty often. It don't seem fair, you go off with your friend and I sit here. Do you think that's fair? That's what we lived on. Fish for breakfast, dinner and supper. Do you think that's fair, you going off on these little trips? No, I don't. But you don't like fishing or campin. I sure do not. I would like to go to Casper or Cheyenne or Billings, go to the movies, eat out, see different people and houses. Do something different. This is a terrible life. I'm sorry, Alma. I wish I liked going to town and the movies. I wish I made more money. I wish I was different. You don't know how bad I wish I was different. I been standing it, but I can't stand it forever. Won't you try for that job? No. We got fence work next week. Then drive the cows up to the high pastures. And then... You are backing me into a corner, Ennis. I mean it. Soon as I get this damn sale writ up I'm heading out for Cody. When are you going to grow up and quit fooling with bullriding? It's not like you're the champion. You used to like rodeo pretty good when you was barrel racing. I did. But that was then. - Things change. - I noticed. I've got responsibilities now. Little Bobby, more and more of the business since Daddy died. Yeah, I know. And I been thinking about hanging up my bull rope. I want to make some real money. That's good to hear. So when will you be back? Couple days. Course something might come up. If something comes up I'll give you a call. Sure you will. Like the time I didn't hear from you for a week. I hope you quit the rodeo. And the tom-catting around that goes with it. You're a pretty good salesman, Jack. Since daddy died we've tripled business. Face it, Jack, thirty-one is too old to rodeo. Says you. Anyway, I can't get excited about selling to these poor old boys. I rather have a little ranch. Oh please, not that 'little ranch' again. I'd give it a try. If I was on my own. But not with you. You're sure not the ranch type. Thanks for the compliment. Too bad you are not as good in bed as you are selling tractors. Are you back on that? It happens to everybody. Now and then. Every time? - Maybe you're not my type. - Yeah? What is your type? Some knock-kneed flatchested teenager? I saw you looking at Shirley that brings the sandwiches. You'll never know. Daddy, you were right. I hoped Jack would learn to speak well, not like a hick, wear white shirts and tie. Read books. Give up his rodeo ways. He said he didn't have much school. He said he would change. But he won't give up the rodeo and his fishing trips with rough friends. I know he sleeps with the rodeo girls. The wife always knows. He comes home and doesn't touch me for weeks and weeks. It isn't fair, Daddy, it isn't right. - Daughter. - Daddy? Don't be scared, now. You called and I answered. Ah can do that much. And from where I am now I get a real dark look at that sidewinder. Worse than you think, and it ain't buckle bunnies he's messing with, neither. Daddy! I can't believe this! Better believe it. I only got a few seconds left. I will protect my little gal. I made some contacts here. See what I can do... I heard about a place I can run a few horses. - Mr. Howard's got... - Live out on that run-down old ranch? Never. Forget it, Ennis. I can't stand how we live. I just can't do it any more. There's just not enough money. What do you want me to do? Rob a bank? Don't interrupt. I been trying to say this for years. I need a different life. There's no fun, there's no love, there's no money. Bill Jones and me want to be together. I want a divorce. I'm surprised we got this far. I won't stand in your way. I'll pay you as much as I can for the girls. Do what you want and I'll sign the papers. I'm glad you see it that way. I'm leaving right now and I'm taking the girls. We can fix up days for you to see them later. - You been a good father. - I love them little girls. I know you do. We'll all have thanksgiving together. We'll still be friends, Ennis. Jack. It's me. Ennis! What's wrong? First time you ever called me. Called to let you know that me and Alma is getting divorced. I thought you'd want to know. She just left, took my girls. Oh my God. That's terrific! Oh my God. She plans to marry that grocery store guy. I guess I'll be an ornery old bachelor now. I'm on my way! Jesus, this is great news. No! Jack, you hear me? Do not come up here. Hello? Jack? - Jack, I told you not to come. - No you didn't. Yes I did. But you hung up. You're getting divorced, Ennis! I came up to be with you. We'll look at ranches. To buy. Be together. All the time. Not just once in a while. Tired of telling you. I can not do it. That part has not changed. It won't never change. I don't want to be like them sissy guys they make jokes about. And I don't want to be dead. You said that before. What do you mean, 'be dead'? O.k., Jack. Down home. There was these two old guys ranched together. Little cow-calf operation like you keep wanting. Earl and Rich. Dad would pass a remark when he seen one of them. Tough old birds, but kind of a local joke. I was nine years old when they found Earl dead in an irrigation ditch. - Earl and Rich. - Yeah? So what? Lots a ranchers drop dead in irrigation ditches. Dad took me and my brother to get a look. They'd took a tire iron to him. Spurred him up, dragged him around so he was bloody pulp. He was just a piece a dirty meat. I didn't understand. Dad said he done bad things with Rich. He told us what them bad things was. Your dad showed that to you? When you was a little kid? Jesus! No wonder you're so mule-headed about us. It was his lesson not to be like Earl. Dad could be one of them that done it. If he was alive and seen us doing what we do it might be us. Two guys living together? Earl and Rich? Jack and Ennis? I can't see it. And I can't do it. - You're afraid, Ennis, ain't you? - Yeah, I'm afraid a them,... You're afraid of them people out there. But I ain't afraid of nothing else. Your neighbors and them people downtown? Hell, they're just people. Plain, ordinary people. You don't know what ordinary people can do to somebody that ain't. Like you and me. I feel pretty damn ordinary. I'm as ordinary as anybody else. You think so. Probably old Earl thought him and Rich was ordinary. But his good neighbors didn't see it that way. It's a hell of a thing to kill a man, because he's plain, ordinary people'. That was a long time ago. Things is changed now. Things never change here. They never will. Forget about that stuff. It's going a be all right, Ennis. Come on. Off limits. That's where Alma and me sleep. I mean slept. Already forget you are getting divorced from her? It's just the idea. Anyways, talking about old Earl and Rich, I ain't in the mood. That's a first. Sounds like me and Lureen. Fact is, I don't have no hard feelings for Alma. What about my feelings? Nothing that happened it wasn't Alma's fault. She's a good person. I can't stand this. Too bad your daddy never showed up, but that's how he is. He drives that broken old truck. He's not dependable, like Bill. He don't take you to the movies and buy you popcorn, like Bill. Sorry I'm late. Truck wouldn't start. I know you favored this thing. Remembered it when I was halfway here and turned around to get it. I can sure live without it. Want some turkey? I ain't hungry. I fried some eggs. But I'll help you clean up. Well. How are you, Ennis? Ok, I guess. Why don't you get married again? It might be good for you. For your own sake get married again. Once burned... You wasn't burned. I was the one got burned. What the hell do you mean 'got burned'? Had your way about everything. I give you the divorce. I pay you child support. I stay out of your way. I hardly ever see the kids. So what do you mean, you got burned? You always blow up, don't you? Just get mad. - I am not mad! - Well, I can get mad, too. You think I am dumb, but maybe I am not so dumb. I don't think you are dumb. All them fishing trips? You never brought any fish home. So once I tied a note on the end of the fishing line. It said. 'Bring some fish home, love, Alma.' You told me you caught a whole mess of brown trouts. You ate them up. With him. Remember? When you went to work I looked. There was my note still tied on the end of the line. That fish line was never near water! That don't mean nothing. I used one of Jack's rods. Don't lie, don't try to fool me. I know what it means. Jack Twist? Jack Nasty! You and him. - You and him. It makes me sick! - Shut up! That's why you don't want to get married again. - Why should you? You got him. - Shut up! Mind your own fucking business. You don't know nothing about it. I'm gonna yell for Bill Go ahead. I'll make him eat the floor. And you too! - Whoa! What's going on? - Stop! Daddy. Wait! Get back here Del Mar! Up here! Take the left fork. Dammit Jack. I missed you pretty bad. Still makes me nervous right out in broad daylight. Nice with the creek just over there. Its running high with snow-melt. And noisy. We can't hear them bad guys sneak up on us. Miles a blue sky. When I come in I seen a bear down-trail. I seen his tracks. And yours. I hope he don't decide to join us. Feels good to be here. It's been too long. I missed the smell of wood smoke in your hair, your shirt, on your skin. Missed being close to you. Looked like he was coming right at me. But he crossed the trail and ran off. Better hang up the food tonight. All the headaches go away when we get back in the mountains. It's like we're both kids again with the whole world in front of us. We can do anything. Jeez, I wish that was true. Me too. But we're o.k. Making the best of what we got. How's little Bobby doin? Not so little any more. He's taller than me. At that smart-guy stage. I used a want a boy for a kid, but just got girls. I didn't want no kids of either kind, but fuck-all worked the way wanted. Nothing ever come to my hand the right way. Surprised to hear you say that. Compared to me you made out pretty good. You made a lot of money. Nice clothes, new truck. - You know what I mean. - Still married. Oh yeah. Here we go again, saying goodbye. This was one of the best times. - Ennis, I wish... - Heading back to Texas now? Not yet. Guess I'll go see my folks first. I can't wait until our big horse trip in August. Ten beautiful days. I'm going a buy a new hat for the occasion. I been putting off telling you, Jack. I can't get away again until November. - November! - After we ship stock. What in hell happened to August, to our horse trip? We said august, ten days. Christ, Ennis, why didn't you tell me this before? You had a fucking week to say something about it. And why do we always have to meet in the frigging cold weather? Jack, Jack. We ought a go south for a change. We ought a go to Mexico one time. Mexico? All the traveling I ever done is going around the coffee pot looking for the handle. I got to run the hay crew in August, that's what happened to August. Lighten up. We can hunt in November. Get a nice elk? You know, this is a goddamn bitch of an unsatisfactory situation. You used to come away easy. Now it's like seeing the pope! I got to work. Them earlier times I used to quit the jobs. You got money. You forget how it is being broke all the time. I need this job. I can't quit it. And I can't get loose in August. This week that we just had was the trade-off for August. - You got a better idea? - I did once. - Mexico? You been to Mexico? - Hell yes, I been. What's the fucking problem? I will say this to you one time and I ain't fooling. What I don't know, all them things I don't know could get you killed if I should come to know them. Try this one, and I'll say it just one time. We could of had a real good life together. You wouldn't do it, Ennis. What we got now is Brokeback Mountain. - It's all we got boy, fucking all. - No! It's more than... I hope you know that if you don't never know the rest. Count them! The damn few times we been together in twenty years. Then ask me about Mexico. Then tell me you'll kill me for needing it... and not hardly never getting it. You got no fucking idea how bad it gets. I'm not you! I can't make it on a couple a high-altitude fucks once or twice a year. Stop! We always get along, we always look at each other and understand. Not this time. I'm rich enough, we could buy a small ranch and some stock. Your goddamn horses. We could do it. But you won't. It's the same sorry situation. Don't you think I got feelings? Nobody knows better than me that you got feelings. I wish I could do what you wanted. I wish we lived in a different world. We don't have to stay here. I belong here. I don't fit nowhere else. Nothing has changed. Nothing can change. I was born here and I belong to this place, whatever it is. When I was a kid I wanted to go everywhere. I can't leave. Not even for you. Not even for us. To be happy. I wanted to fall in love and I did. - I wish I knew how to quit you. - Don't never say that! No! Ennis, what's wrong? I'm here. Close to you. - Hey Ennis, how you doin? - Good enough. You? Just scraping along. Stoutamire hirin? Maybe in the spring. Calving time. Fence work after the snow's gone. I'll check in. You take care, now. You bet. Deceased? Deceased. Dead! No! Jack, no! What is wrong with him? Who is he? Works for Stoutamire. Bad news. He keeps to himself. Something not right. He is a hard man. Always looking for a fight. Something different about him. Bad news. Something not right. Nervous. He's had bad news. Who was his people? Killed in a car wreck long ago. Over in Sage. Del Mar! Something not right. Long ago. - Hello? - Can I talk to Jack. Please! Who is this? Ennis Del Mar? His fishing buddy? We're old friends. Please put him on. I'm sorry to tell you this but Jack passed away in July. An accident. Couldn't notify his friends. Didn't know how to get in touch. What happened? How? I seen him in May and he was beautiful. A freak accident. The said He pumped a tire on some back road. They said the rim flew up Broke his jaw and knocked him out. They said he drowned in his own blood. Oh God. Drowned in his own blood! Drowned in blood. Would have let you know but I didn't have your address. He was only thirty-nine years old. Is he buried down there? He always said he wanted to be cremated, scatter his ashes on Brokeback Mountain. I sent his ashes up to his folks. I thought Brokeback Mountain was up there. Somewhere. We herded sheep together one summer on Brokeback. One summer on Brokeback. Beautiful. He said it was his special place. His folks still up in Lightnin Flats? They'll be there until they die. You get in touch with them. Maybe a good idea if his wishes were carried out. I'm going up there. Now. Want some coffee, don't you? Piece of cherry cake? Thank you, ma'am, I'll take a cup of coffee... but I can't eat no cake just now. I feel awful bad about Jack. Can't beging to say how bad I feel. I known him a long time. We was good friends. I come by to tell you that if you want me to carry his ashes up... Up to Brokeback Mountain like his wife says he wanted. I'd be proud to do it. Tell you what. I know where Brokeback Mountain is. He thought he was too goddamn special to be buried in the family plot. He used to come home every year. He helped his daddy fix the fence and mow and all. I kept his room like it was when he was a boy. He slept there when he visited. You are welcome to go up in his room if you want. I can't get no help out here. Jack used to say I'm going to bring Ennis Del Mar up here... and we will lick this ranch into shape. Half-baked idea the two of you was going to help me run this place. Like most a Jack's ideas it never come to pass. Next thing we know... Ma'am, I would like to see his room. I can't get no help out here. There's old Brokeback in the west. Jack, I know you looked out that window a thousand times before you broke loose. Oh God. Jack. Your shirt. My shirt. Your blood. All the years you kept these hid. We was always on the edge. Our life together. Our life apart. Now it's too late and we're both alone forever. You take them. I know Jack would want it so. I think you was his only friend. Life isn't easy for us, it wasn't easy for him. Tell you what. We got a family plot and he's going in it. He ain't going up on Brokeback. You come again. To see his room. To remember Jack. To remember. This is what's left, Jack. I got nothing else. Two shirts, the same age now we was when we started. Couple of postcards. What I can remember. No pictures. No letters. Can't even carry your ashes up to Brokeback. Hard to take. Jack, I'm choked up with love. Love too late. My fault. I can't sleep. Bone tired. Over and over them pictures go through my head. Is it you or old Earl in the ditch? Can't talk to nobody about you. My secret. Nobody knows even now. There is a price for that secret. When something bad happens a man with a secret can't show pain. Feels like my heart's cut out, nothing there but a little stain of blood. And if you can't fix it you got to stand it. I know that. All them years I told you 'No'. I never give you nothing but 'No'. I never give you nothing... ...and I never said what you wanted me to say. I got only one thing I can give you now. Jack, I swear there will never be anybody but you. It was only you in my life and it will always be only you. Jack, I swear.
