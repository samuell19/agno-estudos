'P.K.MISHRA, HOME MINISTER' What are you saying? I hope, you're not joking. This is no joke, sir. I'm serious. How can they get hold of such an important thing? I too am surprised. Are you sure about it? - Of course, sir. I'm hundred per cent sure. I've checked it personally. Hello, I wish to speak to the Prime minister. Immediately! This is utterly disgusting! All of you are sitting here peacefully, while they've spoilt our game plan. We've lost the boat and the box. I've been telling you repeatedly, not to entrust such an important mission, to those ***. All that we had planned for three long years has been ruined. Stop it. What's the matter? - Joseph, I said stop it. You don't realise, if the government finds out what that box contains, they'll arrange for the army along with the police, to protect it. Then you can play video games, to your heart's content. I too feel it's useless to, trust outsiders for this work. We should try to get the container back, ourselves. We will face the consequences. Do you realise now, why I'm wary of recruiting pretty girls in my gang? All they have is good looks, they don't have any brains. Suvarna. Let her go. Didn't you hear what I said? Pushkar please explain to her, that the police think we are terrorists. They are waiting for us at all check posts, armed with our photographs. Not that I'm scared of death, I just want to make a success of our mission. We must get this work done, by outsiders instead of doing it ourselves. Where will we find an outsider? When will we use our underworld connections? I know a man called, Khurana. He'll do our work. Who is he? Yes, Khurana is the man. "Daud!" "Daud!" "Daud! Daud! Daud!" I have warned you, not to enter our locality. Your locality? Did your grandfather write off this property to you? "Daud!" Are you going for a hockey match? - Shut up. Don't touch me. - What will you do? I said, don't push me. - Come on, what will you do? I did warn you, not to touch me. Why don't you understand? You ***. Hold on. Let me get my glares out of the away. Didn't I tell you, let me get my glares out of the way? Yes, hit him. I told him to allow me to keep my glares, yet he continued to attack me. Come on, hit him. Halt! Let me keep my glares. Wait a minute! Stop. Just a moment. I'm Khurana. What I am about to tell you, is a great secret. It's top secret. I don't want anyone to know about it. Should I leave? Stop joking. My goods are with the customs department, at Indira docks. It's a box and you have to get it for me. Will you do it? I'll pay you Rs 100,000. What's inside the box? Gold biscuits, worth Rs 10 million. Do you think I'm a beggar? Rs 100,00 against Rs 10 million? I won't go out and buy biscuits at the supermarket for that money. He wants me to be satisfied with such a paltry sum? All right, I'll pay you Rs 200,000. Rs 300,000! Rs 400,000! Rs 500,000! How much do you want? One million! - What? One million?! - Why are you screaming? I thought you didn't want anyone to know. It's too much. If you need the best man, you should be ready to pay well. All right but the work should be done by tomorrow. Tomorrow? I'll do it day after. - What's the problem? I have to go for a haircut. - Haircut? I said, don't crack jokes. I want the work done by tomorrow. Okay! You'll have to pay Rs 200,000 more for that. What? This is... - Okay, don't worry. I'll do your work tomorrow. Now give me the details of the box. Hello. What's the matter? Why did you send for me, at this hour? I have bad news, Dr Rai. What? I've just received news, that the box has been stolen from the warehouse. What are you saying? - Yes, it's true. I had not posted any security men around that place. What? Why didn't you arrange for security? I thought, too much security would draw more attention. I wanted to handle this situation very casually. I'd planned to hand it over to the army high command, in the morning. But now this problem has cropped up. What shall we do now, Mr. Mishra? I've called the police commissioner, he is on his way. Do you mean to say, you will reveal everything to him? No, Dr Rai. I won't tell the commissioner everything. The secret might be compromised and it will become public knowledge. This may create chaos and the situation might worsen, which will be impossible to handle. But we have to tell the police something. We'll tell them, the box contained gold. Hello, sir. You called me here at this hour, any problem? I have to discuss something important with you. Hello. - Sir, Shree here. There's an emergency case, please come soon. Good morning, sir - Good morning, Shree. How did this robbery take place? Sir, the thief cut off the alarm connection. Both the coast guards have been suspended and an enquiry is underway. What was robbed? - Gold, worth Rs 20 million. Gold? This case should be handled by the customs department, why are we being called in? - I have no idea. They want us to catch the thief alive. I see. Any other details? - Yes, sir. What? - We got a photograph, from the close circuit camera. We've sent it across to all check posts and hotels in town. Good! Where is the commissioner? - He's inside. Where are you? - With the box. Where's the box? - Do you think I'm a kid? Get the money and take your box. Got it! All right. Meet me at 9 pm, in the lobby of Hotel Paradise. Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Park the car. - Yes, sir. Where's Jimmy? He said, he'd be here by evening but he hasn't turned up as yet. What happened next? He had to attend a party... - Hello, guys. I wonder, where he has disappeared. Hello, Ronnie. What's up? - You tell me. What's happening? You're so late, we were waiting for you. Come, let's go for Mac's party. No, I'm tired of seeing the same girls. There are no fresh faces. - Why not? Mac's sister has just returned from America. You said you wanted a fresh chick, look there! Hello. Ma'am, he is talking to you. I said, hello. You're very beautiful. Don't you think, you ought to thank me for praising you? Any problem? Just get lost. I'm asking her, not you. I said, get lost. Go home and apply some balm, you'll be all right. Then dip your hands in warm water. Now stop crying, will you? I would've managed even without your help. Don't think you are a hero. Do you have a match box? I do, but I won't give it to you. I hate people who ask for match boxes. Please give me a matchbox. I've lived in America for twenty years. Nobody asks for match boxes in America. Do you know why? - Why? All of them use lighters. I have a matchbox but I didn't give it to you. Do you know why? - Why? I was waiting to share this joke with somebody, since morning. "Come on, challenge me, if you have the guts?" "Either you accept defeat, or defeat me" "No one could stand up against me" "Nor could anyone defeat me" "Whoever dared to challenge me, lost bitterly" "He had to leave with his head hanging in shame" "Don't boast so much my dear, I can see through you" "I'm strong enough to stand up against you, but I won't do it" "It's not my style, to challenge people like you" "People will scorn me if I get into a fight with a girl" "She's so dainty and frail, even a breeze could blow her away" "Look, I warn you, don't jump around too much" "You might sprain your back" "Take care of your gentle limbs" "I'm afraid you might hurt your head" "Take care of yourself and learn a trick or two" "Then we'll see, who has broken limbs" "Don't boast so much my dear, I can see through you" "I'm strong enough to stand up against you, but I won't do it" "No one could stand up against me" "Nor could anyone defeat me" "Whoever dared to challenge me, lost bitterly" "He had to leave with his head hanging in shame" "This is a simple case of, the pot calling the kettle black" "If you are defeated by me" "you won't know where to hide your face" "You can't provoke me, by your scathing tongue" "Once I decide to do something, no one can stop me!" "Come on, challenge me, if you have the guts?" "Either you accept defeat, or defeat me" "It's not my style, to challenge people like you" "People will scorn me if I get into a fight with a girl" "She's so dainty and frail, even a breeze could blow her away" "Oh, my love! Oh, my love!" "Oh, my love! Oh, my love!" "Oh, my love! Oh, my love!" "Oh, my love! Oh, my love!" "Oh, my love! Oh, my love!" "Oh, my love! Oh, my love! Oh, my love!" "Oh, my love! Oh, my love!" "Oh, my love! Oh, my love!" Excuse me, will you return my shirt now? Yes. You dance very well. I used to be a good dancer in America, but I don't dance anymore. Do you know why? - Why? Because I don't live in America anymore. I guess, another song is about to begin. Hands up! Go that way. To the backdoor! Everyone sit down. Down, I say. Hey! Stop! Hands up! I'm sorry, madam. What nonsense is this? I'm Assistant Commissioner Nair, from the crime branch. Does that give you the right to enter any girl's room? Ma'am, I was chasing a thief, who might have... - What are you trying to say? Do you think the thief is hiding behind those curtains and I'm changing in his presence? I want to meet your senior officer. So you are his senior officer? What kind of people does your department recruit? Your staff is so rude! You are mistaken. I am his subordinate. So you work for such a person? You should be ashamed of yourself. Listen, ma'am, we're only doing our duty. You... Let me get dressed properly. I'll protest against the injustice, meted out to women by the police. Please don't forget, you get your salaries, because we pay our taxes. Ma'am, why don't you try to understand? I do understand everything. Is it your job to protect women, or to ogle at them lustily? Am I staring at you lustily? If you aren't, then why are you standing here? Why are we standing here? - Sir, I... Move. You may come out now. Thank you. Face the wall. - What? I see, sorry. Thanks. Thank you. Who are you? I'm nobody. Why were the cops chasing you? The police, where are they? I want to know the truth, why were they chasing you? I saved your life and you are trying to fool me. You keep out of this, that will be better for you. You need not worry about me. Why were the police following you? Because I was leading them. We were playing hide and seek, satisfied? So you think, you're very smart? I don't think so, I am. - I see. Yes, I have been smart since childhood. Have you been a thief since childhood? Do I look like a thief? 'Last night this man stole a black box, from the customs warehouse.' 'The police and customs department have confirmed,' 'that the box contains gold worth Rs 20 million.' 20 million? But that rascal said, it was worth Rs 10 million. You've robbed gold worth 20 million? No, it's worth 10 million. Now look here, I know you've helped me a lot. But I would've managed, even without your help. Don't think you are a Supergirl. "Daud!" "Daud! Daud! Daud!" I wonder, where that rascal has gone. God, they won't spare me. Pinki will devour me alive. I made a grave mistake. He has disappeared with box. Has he run away with the booty? I'll kill that rogue! I'll kill him, when I lay my hands on him. So you lied to me? How dare you cheat an honest man like me? I'll book you under section 420. You said it was worth 10 million, whereas it was worth 20 million. I'll charge you for 40 million. Where's the box? - Where's the money? I want the box, first. - I want the cash, first. I said, give me the box. I said, give me the money. I don't have much time. I don't have any money. I'm warning you for the last time, hand over the box to me. I want my money. We can keep arguing about this. "Daud!" It's tickling me. I don't like such jokes. I'm scared of guns. This is a bad joke. Let's stop this nonsense and talk seriously. Let's talk business. Don't you understand? Didn't I say, I dislike such jokes? Move it, I say. What a strange man you are! Tell me quickly or I'll... Don't move. This is a loaded gun and not a pen. Come on, give me the gun. I said, hurry up. Sorry, I lied. But don't move. Okay, now walk. Nobody moves. Come on, move. But how did you get here? This is no time to discuss this. - But listen to me... We must leave this place. We can talk later. Okay. - Okay. Take this. Rascal, you tried to cheat me. I'll teach you a lesson. You also spoilt my new trousers. But how did you... - Shut up and leave. Come on, you fool. Move. One bullet in your head and you'll know how it feels. You cheated on me. Now you'll know... No! Don't kill him! Don't kill him! Hey! Get them! Ah! Huh! First, tell me, how did you reach here? Look, that's you. - I'm dead. Let's run from this place, hurry up. 'WANTED' Mr Nair, how can you commit such a grave mistake? The commissioner said that, the thief had almost been caught but managed to escape. Sir, we tried our best, but we failed. Mr Nair, in this case even a minor mistake could land us in trouble. I think, you should plan your moves. By the way, meet Mr Rai. He works for the intelligence agency. He has been appointed by the central government, to investigate this case. Hello. - Hello. Dr Rai, it seems you feel, that we are not dealing with this case seriously, which is not a fact. Neither are we going ahead without a plan. This is a field job, such things are common. Nair, nobody is doubting your dedication. But please try to understand the situation. We are answerable to our seniors. - I understand that, sir. Look Mr Nair, I trust you completely. We have our hopes pinned on you, but we want results. Yes sir. I'll do my best. Sir, with due respect, may I ask you a question? Gold smuggling is very common. But why is everyone so nervous and tense about this case? Is there any special reason? Nair, this case is related to an international racket. That is all I can tell you, at the moment. Yes, sir. You have to make a bill for a higher amount. What amount should I write? Increase it by twenty per cent and you can keep five per cent. All right. What a body? Is it yours? Madam, if my body is not mine, then is it yours? Modern vehicles are not so strong, And neither do they look so sturdy? - Huh? Which model is this? You are talking about the vehicle? This is a 1980 model and I am sixty. Will you please, give me a lift? Why not? I can leave the world if you say so. How sweet! Body? - No. Then who? Your scarf. I love it. By the way, where are you going? Where do you want to go? I want to go to Khandala. I just remembered, I am also going that way. Is it? - Yes. Shall we? - Please come. "Come, sit in my car" "Come, sit in my car" "Come, sit in my car" "Come, sit in my car" Who are you? Tell me, who are you? I asked you something? Hello. - Hello. I've seen you somewhere. Please try to understand! If we don't get that man, Pinki will ruin our lives. He will not tolerate all this. Therefore go and look for him. Get him, quick. May I come in? Pushkar, how many times have I told you, I don't like the sound of gunshots? At least, affix a silencer. He refuses to listen! I was passing by. So, I thought I will greet you. Hi. Pinki, listen to me, Pinki. Pinki... Pinki, listen... I want to tell you something, Pinki. - Mr Khurana. Mr Khurana. - I want to tell you something, sir. I want to tell you something, sir. Sir, I... Sit here and talk. I want to tell you the entire thing in detail, sir. I... I... - Here... Sit here. I need to clarify something, sir. We were about to do the job. What happened? - We were about to do the job. I did my best. - You did your best? Please, believe me. - I did not give you the job to try. I asked you to complete the job. Yes, yes, I was about to finish it. That's why I tried. We have been running around for three years to get this job done. Three years! - Sir, I understand all this. I understand all this but... - Do not interrupt. A girl... - Do not interrupt. A girl came in the way, sir. Where did a girl come into the scene from? None of us realised it. None of us. That girl came in our way, all of a sudden, sir. We were just about to complete the task, sir. He talks too much. Sir, give me on chance, sir. - How can I give you a chance? How can I give you a chance? Sir, I have never goofed up before. First, we have been wandering for three years! Sir, I have never goofed up before. Please, give me five to seven hours. Please, give me five to seven hours. Five to seven hours, indeed! In our business, there is no scope for, blunder, error, mistake, fault or slip! Do you get it or not? - Stop the drama, Pinki! He is dead. Now, think about what to do next? I'd warned you, that we should do this job ourselves. We shouldn't rely on outsiders. But Pinki, just won't listen to me. Didn't I warn you? Stop this blame game, forget about what has happened. Try to think, where can we find him? Where will you look for him? The police is already looking for him. We must get hold of him, before the cops. The police will catch him easily, but where shall we get information about him? I got an idea. Who are you? Why are you following me? Why don't you answer me? Why should I answer this question? Have you told me who you are and why the cops are chasing you? I didn't tell you because, I didn't want a simple girl like you, to land into trouble. Who told you I am a simple girl? All right, you are not a simple girl, but tell me honestly, why are you following me? Fifty-fifty. What? Fifty-fifty. Fifty-fifty? Marriage? Sorry. Then why the hell are you following me? Look, the gold is worth Rs 20 million. Give me half of it, you can keep the rest. We're dead. Move the vehicle, quickly. Hello, sir. - You? You're a girl. - That's right, I have never claimed to be a boy. I mean, I've never seen a girl driving a truck. I don't believe it. If Basanti can ride a horse cart, why can't I drive a truck? Basanti? Who's she? The famous Basanti, in the film Sholay. The one who lived in Ramgarh, the macho man Veeru's girlfriend. Veeru's girlfriend? Who is Veeru? The same Veeru, who was summoned by Thakur to kill Gabbar. Shut up, silly girl. Is this your truck? - Yes, it's mine. My father gifted it to me, on my birthday. He gifted my mother a tempo, she drives a tempo. Then what does your father do? He looks after the house. The whole family is very influential! Let me check it out. - What are you looking for? What are you hiding? - Nothing. "Daud! Daud!" "We run here! We run there! This life is a race!" "One runs, and the others chase... Life is a race!" "Some run after money..." "Others chase their love..." "Hey, some run after money..." "Others chase their love..." "Daud! Daud!" "Daud! Daud!" "Daud! Daud! Daud! Daud!" "We run here! We run there! This life is a race!" "One runs, and the others chase... Life is a race!" "This world is crazy!" "What sort of restlessness is this?" "This world is crazy! What sort of restlessness is this?" "Everyone is after something or the other..." "Just as an ant's heart yearns for sugar!" "Life is a race! Daud! Daud!" "Daud! Daud! Daud! Daud!" "We run here! We run there! This life is a race!" "One runs, and the others chase... Life is a race!" "Some run after money..." "Others chase their love..." "Some run after money..." "Daud! Daud!" "Daud! Daud!" "Hey, everything is upside down!" "Oh, dear! There is complete chaos!" "Hey, everything is upside down! Oh, dear! There is complete chaos!" "One must fight to survive." "But who wants to die?" "Hey Daud! Hey, daud!" "Daud!" "Daud! Daud! Daud! Daud!" "We run here! We run there! This life is a race!" "One runs, and the others chase... Life is a race!" "Some run after money..." "Others chase their love..." "Some run after money... Others chase their love..." "Daud! Daud!" "Daud! Daud!" "Daud! Daud! Daud! Daud!" Puja, where are you? - I'm here. I'm getting late. - Come, my child. I'll come back late, don't worry. All right. Who is it? - Postman. Postman. - Huh! Have a chocolate. Won't you eat a chocolate? Yeah? You won't eat? Ah! Look, when I was a child like you, I would yearn for chocolates. But my mother would lie to me. She said that if I eat chocolates, I would fall sick. And the teeth... They will fall off! And I would cry. I would cry all day. One day, my mother died. My mother died. And then... I could have had as many chocolates, as I felt like. But, by then I was an adult. I wouldn't feel like eating chocolates. That is why I say, eat the chocolate if you feel like it. Have the chocolate. Oh, Oh, oh, oh? You will eat it if your mother gives it to you? You want your mother, to feed you chocolate? Hi, mom! Hey, mom. Please feed your son some chocolate. Ooh! La! La! La! What a fair hand! And these green bangles on your fair hand... If a little blood oozes out, it will form a lovely 'rangoli.' Red, green and white. - Let go of my wife's hand. So, what should I hold? Hey, forgive me. It is a sin to touch another man's wife. However sexy, sister-in-law is, I mustn't look. What say, son? You probably hate this talk? What say, sister-in-law, Suvarna? - Come to the point. Sister-in-law, sister-in-law, sister-in-law. Hey! Talk some sense into your husband. What do you want? Tell me, clearly! Information... About a thief. As soon as the police get a clue about the thief, you must get in touch with me, immediately. And, please tell us the whereabouts of the thief. Otherwise, your entire family will sleep in the cemetery. By order. Understand? I cannot betray. I am not a traitor. Yes, but you are a father? Or do you want me to cut your innocent son's lips, and increase his jaw opening by two inches? So, that he keeps smiling for the rest of his life. And can work as a model for a toothpaste ad? A fiery son of an honest father! Uses Colgate every day! Stop it, now. This is no child's play. Everyman is under scrutiny in our department. And, how will I give you the information? If you want your son to live, you will have to do all this. Otherwise, this scoundrel will smile with his injured lips for life and you will look at him and cry all your life. Got it? Son, ask your father, not to be so stubborn. Papa, you mustn't be so stubborn. Papa, you mustn't be so stubborn. - Yes, yes, yes. Will you do it? Son, day 'Jai Hind!' to your father. 'Jai Hind!' - Say it louder. 'Jai Hind!' - Say it louder. 'Jai Hind!' What are you saying? They got away again. I'm sorry sir, it was our mistake. How many more mistakes will you make? Even the last time he... Sir, inspector Rana was to blame, he let the girl go. A girl? Who was she? Her name is Basanti. What is the date today? Twenty-fifth. - Hmm. Another five days before we receive the salary. What do you think? Will we get a hike this time? Not just salary, we should get a twenty-five per cent bonus. - Hmm. Otherwise, we will grow old like this one day. There is no news of the increase in DA either. Is it? - Huh, sir. So, my constable needs a salary hike? And you also want a twenty-five per cent bonus? Hey, we should deduct your salary. And that too by fifty per cent. You have done such a brave act! A girl fooled you! Idiots! They call themselves policemen! Policemen! Hey, they wear the uniform and claim to protect the people! Do you know why he was miffed? The same girl had him fooled too. What? - Yes. Hey! Look around and see if you can find water to drink. My father's five star hotel is in the vicinity, you can have a cold drink there. You think you're very smart, don't you? There's no doubt about it. God! Now what? - A thorn... Why do you walk with your head in the clouds? Look at the ground you're walking on. Did you expect to find a carpet, in the jungle? Shut up. You're behind all this. Am I to blame? What do you mean? I told you repeatedly, let drive the truck. But you kept pulling at the steering. Both of us would've died if I hadn't done so. - Come off it. Are you going to teach me how to drive? Idiot! Don't speak to me like that? Don't try to scare me! If you had been a boy, I would've taught you a lesson. She thinks no end of herself. Hey! What would you do? Tell me, what will you do? Answer me. Don't speak to me like that. - What will you do? Come on, show me. Come on, show me. What will you do? Let me go! A girl's place is in the kitchen. She shouldn't quarrel with men. Therefore I advise you, stop trying to be a man. You bit me? Sorry. I said, I'm sorry. Don't touch me. Look, I'm really sorry. I just got carried away. Anyway, Both of us are in trouble. Let's find a way to get out of this mess. Okay? - Yes. What's your name? Tell me your name. Daya Shankar. - What? Daya Shankar. Daya Shankar? Why? It's a beautiful name. What's yours? Uma Parvati. - What? Uma Parvati. Nice meeting you. I hope you remember our fifty-fifty deal? Yes, I do. Basanti? Who is she? - Sir, Mr Nair says inspector Rana met that girl, at the check post. She mentioned 'Sholay' to him. - Sholay? Who is Sholay? - Haven't you heard of 'Sholay'? No, I have never met him. Dr Rai, Sholay is the name of a film. It was one of the greatest hits in India. I'm sorry, but I'm not much of a movie buff. How is 'Sholay' related to this case? Sir, we have to find that out. What are you staring at? What? What are you looking at? Nothing. That's a lie. What? Don't feign innocence. You were staring at me. I was staring at you? - Yes, you were staring at me. All right, I was staring at you. - You shouldn't look at me. I shouldn't look at you? - That's right. Why can't I? Do you own this forest? If I can stare at nature and all that's around us, why can't I look at you? Tell me one thing, does this disease run in your family? You keep fighting and... - Don't talk about my family. Quarrelsome cat! Daya Shankar, tell me something about your family? I don't have a family. Are you alone? I have a boyfriend. Boyfriend? He's very handsome. He looks like a Greek god. - Great! Do you have a girlfriend? What? I asked, do you have a girlfriend? No. Why? I didn't like anyone so far. Daya Shankar. Do you really have a boyfriend? Is it true that you don't have a girlfriend? I asked you first. Maybe. But I'm asking you now. Tell me. You see, er... - Come on, tell me. Why do you wish to know? - Simply. All right, then I needn't tell. I won't answer your question too. - As you wish. Daya Shankar! "Poisonous love..." "I'll sting you..." "My poisonous tongue is ready to strike." "I have turned into a snake from a woman." "Poisonous love..." "I'll sting you..." "My poisonous tongue is ready to strike." "I have turned into a snake from a woman." "I languish on the branches of trees..." "You are my prey. I am on the lookout for you." "I can feel your presence when I am alone." "Your perfume excites me." "Control me or else," "who knows what will happen?" "This poisonous love is intoxicating." "This restlessness that will neither let you live nor die..." "In your eyes..." "I can drink this poison from your eyes." "Come and look into my eyes!" "Let your lips meet mine..." "Poisonous love..." "I'll sting you..." "I won't let you sleep..." "I'll embrace you with my arms..." "Poisonous love..." "I'll sting you..." "My poisonous tongue is ready to strike." "I have turned into a snake from a woman." Daya Shankar! Daya Shankar! Daya Shankar! What? What was that? Why don't you answer me? What's wrong? I saw a helicopter. - Helicopter? What helicopter? - The police helicopter. Where is it? - It was here looking for us. I saw it in the nick of time, or else we would've been in trouble. Do you think I'm a fool? What? - Don't pretend. I know all your tricks. I've noticed that you always, try to touch me under some pretext. I try to touch you? Have you lost your mind completely? - No, you have gone mad! All you can think of is filth! Filth? I know everything. You keep following me all the time. Am I the one following you? You were the one who chased me. I was not chasing you, I was interested in gold. But if I have to put up with a man like you, I don't want that gold. It's goodbye from me. Get lost. Good bye. - I'm leaving, don't try to talk to me. - Just go. Why are you yapping away? I'm not talking to you. I'm not leaving because you asked me to. Who wants to talk to you? - Shut up, Don't talk too much, get lost. - I'm not leaving because of you. Go. I wonder what he thinks of himself? - Daya Shankar! I shouldn't have come with you. He thinks I have no brains. Show off. - Get lost, what does she think of herself? I won't spare you. What do you think of yourself? Look I said sorry. Don't run, wait till I get you. I want to say something. - What? My name is not Daya Shankar. I'm not Uma Parvati either. You're not? - No. Bhawani. Nandu. Nice meeting you. Is there a hotel nearby? - Chako. Chako? - Chako? A hotel? - Chako. Not Chako, but a hotel? We want to eat... - It's all right. So Chako? - Chako. Okay. Chako. Uncle, is there a hotel nearby? Chako. - Chako? Where's the hotel? - Chako. Uncle, we're talking about a restaurant. - Chako. What is Chako? Chako. - Chako. Fatso, where's Chako hotel? I asked you about Chako? That's my name. I want two rooms in your hotel. I said that was my name, it is not a hotel. Get lost. I'm sorry, everyone in the village kept saying Chako, so I thought you own a hotel. I said, leave. Mr Chako. We've come a long way. Please be seated. Please be seated. Here? - Yes. Thank you. - Please! What can I do for you? You see, we've come a long way away. We're extremely tired. If you could arrange for a place for us to live in... Do you want a village? I can give you one. If you want the mountain, take it. Or take the fields, if you want to. Do you want the forest? We don't want the forest. I have not given it away as yet. You see Mr Chako, we have come from the jungle. That is why, I didn't give it to you. Mr Chako. - Yes. If you could arrange for a hotel... There are no hotels in this village. - Really? But don't worry. My name is Chako, I'll help you. Do you know why I'm called Chako? - Do tell me? When I was a kid, I killed a tiger with a knife. Did you hear that? Ever since people have called me Chako. - That's great! As long as I'm with you, you needn't feel scared. I'll fulfil all your requirements. I'm willing to do everything for you. Sorry. Greetings! Everything in this village, including the trees and pebbles are mine. All the villagers are my children. Your children? I mean, they're like my children. I see. I've been ruling this village, for the last four hundred years. Last four hundred years? - Yes, that's right! But you don't look that old? I meant, my ancestors have ruled this village for the last 400 years. I'm young. What brings you here? Chennai. - Delhi. Chennai - Delhi. You see, I'm from Delhi and she's from Chennai. I'm from Chennai.. - You're from Delhi and she's from Chennai. I've come from Chennai and he's from Delhi. You're from Chennai and he is from Delhi? - No, I'm from Delhi and she's from Chennai. Never mind! But why have you come here? Why? I want to know. Because her father is a great hunter. My father too was a great hunter. What was your mother's profession? My mother? - Yes, your mother? My mother was not a hunter. - Neither was mine. You see mothers shouldn't be hunting, it has a bad effect on the children. But my mother was a hunter. A great hunter! Why? Why? What do you mean? - Why? You mean, why was she a hunter? Why have you come here? Why did we come here? Because her father is a great hunter. And... Why don't you tell him, Daya Shankar? - Daya Shankar? Who is Daya Shankar? - That's my name. Daya Shankar? Why not? It's a lovely name, Daya Shankar. My name is Chako. Nice to meet you. I'm Uma Parvati. Nice to meet you. But why have you come here? Why are we here? Because her father is a great hunter. I already know that. What next? Well, her father is who is a great hunter... - I know that. He came to this forest while chasing a tiger. This forest? - Yes. Then? The tiger ran ahead while her father followed. The tiger led while her father followed. - No. Her father was behind the tiger. Her father was behind the tiger and the tiger was leading. You don't get it, Mr Chako. The tiger led, while her father followed. The tiger led while her father followed. First tell me, who was hunting? The tiger or her father? My mother. - Mother? Where did she come from? Answer him Daya Shankar. - I... Mr Chako, actually... - Yes. My father is a great... - He is a great hunter. I know that well. My father was also a great hunter. And my mother too was a great hunter. I said, I know that. What happened after that? My father followed the tiger, right into the dense forest. I see. - His mother went to look for him. Come on, you tell the rest. - Me? What happened next? Well, her father who is a... He is a great hunter, I know that. What happened after that? Then, her father who is a... - He is a great hunter, I do know that. What next? - He entered this forest while chasing a tiger. The tiger... - The tiger led while her father followed... What happened next? The tiger led while her father followed... The father followed while the tiger led. Then? Look, you don't understand. Father was behind the tiger, - Ahead? Behind. - Ahead? No, behind. - I mean what happened ahead? All right. Well, her father who was a... - He was a great hunter! I have understood that. What happened next? He entered this forest while chasing a tiger. The tiger went ahead and her father followed, father was being led by the tiger but what happened after that? My mother who was a... She is a great hunter, I know that. She was following them, but what happened next? My mother who is a great hunter, walked behind her father. The tiger led, her father followed the tiger and my mom followed him. The tiger was behind my mother and her father was behind the tiger. The tiger led, while her father followed. He was a great hunter, yes he was. Then behind them was your mother, she too was a great hunter, very great! But how did the tiger get behind them? Wasn't the tiger leading, how did he get behind your mother? Do you think I'm a fool? You see, they were running around in circles. In a circle? - Yes. I get it now. Both of you followed them and lost your way. That's brilliant, Chako! You're great! You're too great! You're a genius. - Chako! Please come in. This is my humble palace. This? Yes, this is it! It's beautiful! - Thank you. We have everything, nothing is lacking. Just... I need someone by my side. Please come, this way. My grandfather took forty years, to get this palace built. He had to cut down four hundred trees. I don't want anyone's help. I'm perfectly okay. I'm all right. Mr Chako, we've been roaming around the forest, for the last 2 days. Could you arrange for us to have a bath? - Yes, of course. But Uma Parvati, we don't have clothes to change into. Mr Chako, can we get some clothes? Yes, I'll arrange for them. Nandu, you look fabulous in this attire. You are also looking very beautiful. Hey. - Hey! Who is this joker? Speak softly, Chako might hear you. Chako doesn't wear a moustache. This is my grandfather. My great grandfather. He was a great man! His was so great that he remained a bachelor all his life. He didn't get married? - Never! He remained unmarried all his life. What a man! And this is my hunter, who was a very great father! He too was very great! I really adore his greatness. I guess, he too was unmarried. How would I be here today, if he hadn't married? Mr Chako, what about your mother? My mother? She died much before I was born. I got this made especially for you. This is an egg. Open it and see. There's a fried chilly inside it. Just for you. - How sweet! It's spicy, not sweet. - It's spicy? I love spicy stuff. - Wait a moment. Don't you know, you should give it to the lady first? I'm sorry. I'll give it to her. Please take this. - Thank you. It's very tasty. Really too good. - Thank you. Did your wife make this? I'm unmarried. You're unmarried? As of now, I am unmarried. I haven't found the right girl. What are you saying, Chako? How can that be possible? Any girl would want to marry you. You mean it? - Absolutely. What does a girl look for in a man? - What? She doesn't want wealth or power, she wants a kind-hearted man. Where else would she find a kind-hearted man like you? You're the king of this forest. The girl who gets to be your queen, will be the luckiest girl on earth. Thanks. Thanks. This is my village. What language is this? Sorry. It was Hindi. - Hindi? Yes, but I speak it like Hebrew. Mr Chako, what are they getting ready for? They're preparing for a feast. When two moons appear on the same night, we must celebrate. Two moons on the same night? - Two moons on the same night. One is up there in the sky and the other is you. Chako Uncle. This is the drink, which will intoxicate you immediately! Thanks. Please have this one, you'll love it. Cheers! Where's my glass? Cheers! - Cheers. I don't think this is intoxicating. - What? I think it's mind-blowing. - Yes. You are drunk, but I don't need a drink to intoxicate me. But wait, the musical program is yet to begin. We shall dance. Really? - But not in these clothes. So let's change. - Yes. "The moment the sun sets, I feel I'm walking on the clouds" "Is it my youthful fervour, or is it someone's love?" "What is it that intoxicates me?" "I searched every nook and corner" "But love was not to be found" "Every part of my being blossoms, because I have found true love" "The moment the sun sets, I feel I'm walking on the clouds" "Is it my youthful fervour, or is it someone's love?" "What is it that intoxicates me?" "I searched every nook and corner" "But love was not to be found" "I found my love, yes I finally found it" "My love is close to me" "The moment the sun sets, I feel I'm walking on the clouds" "Is it my youthful fervour, or is it someone's love?" "This world which thirsts for wealth" "does not realise that love is priceless" "They fight battles in vain," "after all the world is round, what goes around comes around" "The world should treat love as a valuable thing" "Great lovers like Romeo have laid down their lives for love" "The power of love is greater than any other power in the world" "This is all one needs to know" "Love is the supreme power" "The moment the sun sets, I feel I'm walking on the clouds" "Is it my youthful fervour, or is it someone's love?" "We have invented rockets and satellites" "The invention of the computer is a great achievement" "But if you haven't experienced love, everything else is useless" "I believe that love makes the world go round" "You need to take lessons in the art of love" "I'm a worshipper of love" "I beseech you, to love me" "For god's sake, please listen to me" "Please give me your love" "The moment the sun sets, I feel I'm walking on the clouds" "Is it my youthful fervour, or is it someone's love?" "I searched every nook and corner" "But love was not to be found" "Every part of my being blossoms, because I have found true love" "The moment the sun sets, I feel I'm walking on the clouds" "Is it my youthful fervour, or is it someone's love?" Where has he gone? He must've gone to sleep. - Gone to bed already? How can he fall sleep while you're awake? Very bad. - Very bad. Tell me something, Ram Lakhan. Ram Lakhan? - Sorry! I mean Daya Shankar. Daya Shankar, tell me, how are you related to Meena Kumari? Meena Kumari? I mean Angelina Jolie, Uma, yes Uma Parvati. How am I related to him? None at all. - None at all? I met him yesterday, while searching for my parents. Is that all? Mr Chako. Mr Chako. Mr Chako. I'll go and get a drink. Do you know, who he is? Who? He's wanted. What happened? I lied to you. - You lied? I was forced to lie. That Uma Parvati, I really don't know him. He had actually kidnapped me, in the forest yesterday. He threatened to kill me, if I dared to reveal the truth. Daya Shankar, don't be afraid. I'm with you. I have a big gun inside my house, I'll protect you with that gun. Trust me, I'll protect you. I'll save you. Thank you. Where were you? I was sitting and talking to Chako. Chako? Why do you waste your time with that cartoon? Just because we're sharing this bed, doesn't give you the right to scold me like a husband. I am not married to you. Why don't you get married to me? What? - Yes. Me? Marry you? Why? What's wrong with me? Have you ever been in love? No, I have never fallen in love with anyone. But I can definitely try. Come off it! You will try! You don't know the meaning of love. Bhawani, who are you? Where have you come from? Tell me... Bhawani. Have you seen this man? "The moment the sun sets, I feel I'm walking on the clouds" Yes, play it like this. Push the right button Now the left button. Good, very good. What's the matter? What are you thinking of? I don't know. I think, something is terribly wrong. Every single moment I feel, that our mission is in danger. We don't know what Pinki wants or what he is up to. We've been sitting here since morning, as if we're on a picnic. Pushkar, destiny cannot be averted. Just relax, okay. Tarzan. - Yes. What do you think about love? You heartless man. How would you know what love means? I had fallen in love. One should be prepared to die, for love. It wasn't this kind of frivolous love. She was extremely beautiful. But I shot her one day. - Why? A new film was playing in the theatres. I suggested we go for the late-night show. But she was adamant, she wanted to go for the afternoon show. I tried to reason with her, to come for the night show. She put her foot down and wouldn't budge. I insisted on going for night show, while she wanted to go for noon show. I shot her. - What happened after that? Nothing, I attended the night show with another girl. But didn't she sacrifice her life? One should be ready to die. That is true love, not all this hugging and kissing. Okay. Let's go, we've got him. - We've got him. And what do we do with him? Just finish the calves and bury them somewhere. So that their father thinks they are still, alive, And our in our custody. Understood? So that he does not alert the police. Right? You know what, son? We don't like this violence either. But there is no point in your living in this ill-fated country? This useless poverty! Scam! Scandal! The ministers are thieves! Criminals become ministers. And should I tell you something? If you grow up, there won't be anyone around here. This place will be barren. So, which country will you work for once you grow up, huh? At least, if you die now, you will serve our purpose. Isn't it, sister-in-law? Oh! Sister-in-law. Vermillion on your parting, and a bullet in your chest! You will die as a married woman, lady! Son, say 'Jai Hind' one last time. Say it louder! 'Jai Hind! - 'Jai Hind!' Hmm. Kill him. "Daud! Daud! Daud! Daud!" "Daud! Daud! Daud! Daud!" "Everyone is restless" "Run away" "Life's nothing but a sprint to survive" "Some lead, while some follow" "Life is a mad rush to achieve our goals" "Either you run for wealth" "Or you run for the sake of love" "Either you run for wealth" "Or you run for the sake of love" "Everyone is restless" "Everyone is restless" "Life's nothing but a sprint to survive" "Some lead, while some follow" "Life is a mad rush to achieve our goals" "The world has gone crazy" "Everyone is restless" "Each one is trapped in his own web" "We are all running after something like bees swarm over a honeycomb" "Everyone is restless" "Everyone is restless" Hands up! I said, hands up. "Life's nothing but a sprint to survive" "Some lead, while some follow" "Life is a mad rush to achieve our goals" "Either you run for wealth" "Or you run for the sake of love" "Either you run for wealth" "Or you run for the sake of love" "Everyone is restless" "Everyone is restless" Sir! - I'm sure they went that way. Maybe that way. Did they inform you before leaving? You go there. This way! - Shut up. You go that way and the rest follow me. "Everyone is restless" Shree, I'm sure they went that way, if I'm proved wrong, I'll resign. Get going! - Sir! Go! - Sir! Get going! - "Some lead, while some follow" "Life is a mad rush to achieve our goals" "Either you run for wealth" "Or you run for the sake of love" "Either you run for wealth" "Or you run for the sake of love" "Everyone is restless" "Everyone is restless" "Everyone is restless" We want a lift, please. We're sorry, no place. Why can't you drive slowly? We are going to fall! You led me on a wild goose chase. Now you're screaming your lungs out. The cops were chasing us. We could've met with an accident at that time. We didn't have a choice then. - We don't have a choice now. Look, we must reach the city, before we run out of fuel. But if you drive like this, we're sure to die. No problem. We'll break our limbs. - So be it. Are you out of your mind? - Yes, I've gone crazy. What's on your mind? You want to know? - Yes. Should I? - Yes. I want to sing a song. "We are lovers" "We are madly in love" "We live in a world of our own" "We have no cares in this world" "We are lovers" "We are madly in love" "We live in a world of our own" "We have no cares in this world" "We are lovers" "Our life is immersed in love" "Where will this amazing feeling lead us to?" "Our lives have taken a different turn, we walk the path of love" "Darling let's set out on an unknown journey" "We are lovers" "We are madly in love" "It's a lovely evening, we can rest a while" "A lot needs to be done, God will take care of the rest" "We are lovers" "Sooner or later, we shall reach our destination..." "Like the rivers find their shores..." "Like the stars and the moon meet in the night sky..." "Just as the eyes seek scenic beauty..." "Just as the bees find flowers..." "Like a canoe moves with the help of waves..." "Hearts find their love." "Just as the spring arrives in a garden.." "We will also find our destination." "There is nothing to worry about, now that we are together" "The path of love beckons us" "We are lovers" "We are madly in love" "We live in a world of our own" "We have no cares in this world" "We are lovers... - We are lovers" "We are madly in love... - We are madly in love" What are they doing in a clothes store? They're relishing sandwiches. Sandwiches in a garment store? They'll buy clothes from a sandwich store. He's joking. Just a moment, please. What do you want? Two muffins and two burgers. - Along with red chili sauce. What? You idiot! We're here to buy clothes. We don't sell old-fashioned clothes. Do I look old-fashioned to you? No, I was just... Don't think, show us some clothes. Just a minute, please. I'll help you with it. I want these pants. How much is it for? It's priced at Rs 1200. I don't want to buy a dozen, just this one. Only one costs Rs 1200. That's the market price, but how much will you settle for? Look ma'am, this is a designer pant. It has been imported from America. Whether it has been imported from America or Africa, a pant is a pant, isn't it? You idiot? Can I help you, please? Show me a cool shirt. Would you like to see a designer shirt? Do I look like someone who wears designer shirts? Daya Shankar, will this shirt look good on me? Let me ask this idiot how much does my shirt cost? Excuse me, please don't call me an idiot. Okay, idiot. Idiot! How much is this for? It costs Rs 2500. Do you mean along with the mannequin? The shirt alone costs Rs 2500. The mannequin costs Rs 10,000. - 10,000! For that money, I can get you a real girl to stand here. Daya Shankar, please I want this dress. - What are you saying! Madam please carefully! What are you doing? Look you've dropped it. Please put the wig on the head. - Sorry... Put it on the head. - Please I must have this dress. Please put it on mannequin's head, not mine. I'm sorry. - Thank you. I'm sorry, but I want this dress. I said I'm sorry... - Please put it properly. Put it properly. - I'm trying my best. Look, I'm really sorry. Idiot, please. Let it be! Idiot. - Yes. Won't you give me discount? - No. Do you want me to roam around in these dowdy clothes? You can't do this to me, please. Just a small discount, baby. - Okay, all right. I'll do something. Promise? - Yes. Daya Shankar, the idiot has agreed to give us a discount. Pack it, baby, Boss, now that I've given you the clothes, please tell me, why are you calling me an idiot? Where have you brought me? - You wanted the gold, didn't you? Yes I did. But who keeps gold in such a place? I see, lift it slowly. It sure is heavy. How do we open it? We'll have to break it open. - Then hurry up, Nandu. Who are they? I don't know. How many more people are after you? I said I don't know them. If you don't them, why have they come here? You don't trust me... I do, but.. - You're always fighting. I said I don't know them. - I'm not fighting, you are. Am I a liar? Who are you? You made us travel 580 km. I had to burn fuel worth Rs 3000. I was tired of driving around the countryside. What do you think of yourself? No. Oh god! Why did you scream, sugar pie? Are you in love, with Rambo? Are you crazy about his body? Who are you trying to impress, Rambo? God has put in all his artistry to make you. Don't you dare touch her! So what do you want me to do? Should I stand here like a crippled man? I will kiss your fair lips so hard that they will bleed red... Stop it, Pinki. - Shut up. If you meddle in my affairs, I'll shoot you in the head. Come! Come baby, come. Rascal! If anyone dares to move, I'll blow off your heads. Pinki, let go of her hand. I said, let her go. Pinki, ask your men to put down their guns. Let Daya Shankar to come to me. Didn't you hear what I said? Hurry up. Why are you running after me? Go and look for them. Run! Run! I said run. So you won't. You won't. All right. Daya Shankar. What's going on? Mr Chako, I lied to you. - You lied? I lied to you about being, kidnapped by Nandu. Who is Nandu? I mean Uma Parvati, his real name is G Nandkumar. He's a police inspector. My name is not Daya Shankar. I'm P Bhawani, I'm also a deputy inspector. Both of us are on a mission to nab, an international gang. All this is a part of that investigation. I see. But why are the cops chasing you? It is a covert operation. The entire police department is not aware of it. They are not supposed to know. I get it now. Oh god! I don't have bullets. Who? You idiot! Why didn't you tell me, it was you? I would have saved some bullets. Idiot! You didn't allow me to speak, you simply showered the shots. I couldn't help it. I've broken my hand, help. You stone man! You crushed my hand, someone get me ice. Hands up! Have all of you come to spy on me or to get those rascals? Get me ice. That's enough, baby doll. Come out, everyone. That's it. Someone get me ice. Pinki, let those two play hide and seek. We'll leave with the box. Check his hand. He broke my hand. - Move fast. Lift it. It's the police, run. - Let's run. That side, quick. - Let's run. Hands up! Nandu, let's follow them, they're leaving with the gold. Let them go. - What do you mean? I said let them take it. How can we let go of the thing we were running after? Look, Bhawani. I don't want that gold if I have to put your life in danger for it. I have been running all my life and I've stolen a lot of things. But... Bhawani, I always thought money was the most important thing in life. But not anymore. Nandu, what are you saying? Bhawani, I'm trying to say... I love you. "You can take my life and my youth" "You can take everything, but please give me love" "My sweetheart, my love" "What good is this life without love?" "Youth without love is meaningless" "Everything is futile without love" "A life without love is not worth living" "Take away my life and my youth," "You can take everything, but please give me love" "My sweetheart, my love" "What good is this life without love?" "Youth without love is meaningless" "Everything is futile without love" "A life without love is not worth living" "You can take my life and my youth" "You can take everything, but please give me love" "My sweetheart, my love" "Let this burning passion of love, engulf my being" "I am ready to sacrifice my life, for your love " "I am also yearning to unite with you" "The pangs of love torment us" "The love that ignited desire in our hearts" "has now turned into a flame that consumes us" "I'm willing to surrender myself to you" "You can take my life and my youth" "You can take everything, but please give me love" "My sweetheart, my love" "What good is this life without love?" "Youth without love is meaningless" "Everything is futile without love" "A life without love is not worth living" "Your magnetism draws me closer to you." "However much I try but my heart doesn't want to stay away from you." "We are like one soul in two bodies..." "If you are a spark, I am the dewdrop." "Your ways are absolutely mesmerising." "You live in my heart." "My life is yours... So is my youth, my love." "You can take whatever you want from me." "What is life without love?" "What is youth without love?" "All this means nothing without love." "Oh, my love!" Sir, Dongri police have arrested a man who was firing shots. He's the same man we had met in the village. He says, he has seen that box. So this is where you stay. Nandu, didn't you find any other place? Bhawani, I used to live alone. A home was place to sleep at night. But now that you're here, I'll change the look of the house. The kitchen could be on that side. We'll have a dining table in the centre. That will be our bedroom. We must have two bedrooms. What do we need two bedrooms for? I'll explain, come sit next to me. We fight very frequently. The day we fight, I'll shift you to the other room. Bhawani, we are talking of marriage and you are talking about quarrels. My dear, you must give love a chance. I'm sorry, but I've always been like this. Now that we have decided to marry, tell me, who are you? Where have you come from? Who are your parents? Shree - Yes sir. You may look there. Rana - Yes sir. Come with me. Check the backdoor. Go and look there. - Yes, sir. Over there? - Yes, near those bins. Sir. - Yes. I think this is an old factory. An old factory? - Yes, sir. I think this was a five star hotel. How can you think this was a five-star hotel? What's the matter? Sir says, this was a five-star hotel. A five star hotel? - Yes. Rana. Yes, sir, I agree with you. Please go and look there. Shree, please look outside. Get lost! - Yes, sir. Mr Desai. - Yes? If you suspect the slightest radiation from anything, call me right away. Right, sir. - Yeah, doctor. Dr Rai? You... How come you are here? You? - And who are these people? You, please step aside? I am sorry, Mr Nair. But, we have kept a secret from you all this while. That box doesn't contain gold. So, what is inside that box, Dr Rai? Neutron bomb. What? Actually, we could not trust anyone. Please try to understand, Mr Nair. Even now, we will have to take extreme caution with each step. If this news gets out. So... So the people in the city will become anxious and fearful. There will be rumours. It will cause chaos. And then... Mr Nair, it will be very difficult to handle the situation. I hope you understand what I am saying? Nandu... Nandu, what were they discussing? Hey, that is a neutron bomb. What is a neutron bomb? Hey, it's the same thing that exploded in Japan and thousands of people died. What are you saying? - Huh! So then, why have they come here? - How would I know? Who are these guys, nandu? - Hey, how would I know? But, Nandu why have they come to this city? They probably want to destroy the entire city. - Huh! What are you saying? Hey, let's run. Let's get out of this city! Come on! Wake up. Drive the cab. Hurry up, move. Hurry up. - Wait. Wake up, I said. - What's wrong? Drive. - Where do you want to go? Why don't you start driving? Hurry up, take us anywhere. But where do you want to go? I won't take a passenger for a short distance. You'll get the fare, just move. You don't understand? I must get return fare as well. Who will come back here? Where do you want to go? - Why don't you listen to us? Ma'am, you don't understand my problem. You are educated, why are you behaving like this? But where do you want to go? What are you saying? I'm saying, there will be a cricket match. Two teams, representing two countries. The stadium will be packed with cricket fans. Thousands will throng the stadium. Viewers from 26 countries will be watching it on television. Live telecast! Wasim Akram will bowl, while Sachin Tendulkar will bat. We will bomb the stadium! One blast will kill thousands of people. They will be wiped out of the face of this earth. There'll be no ground and no wicket, because I hate cricket. What a scene that will be! Pinki, you have gone mad. This blast is meant to make the government aware of our power, so that they fulfil our demands. Those innocent people have nothing to do with this. It is not our aim to kill them. It might not be your aim, but it is mine. Just give it a thought, Pushkar. Nothing like this has happened ever before. Have you seen so many people being killed at one time? Reporters from all the television channels worldwide will be here, to cover this event. Little do those rascals know, they too shall perish. A great match in Eden, everyone will go to heaven. Just a moment. If this is what you want, then count me out of this. I'll kill you if you're not with me. You'll have no fun on the run, since it's me who has the gun. Pushkar! Suvarna, please make him see sense. He's being a spoilt sport. Give me the freedom, and I'll show you what I can do. Please! Don't go away, see you after the blast! But why did you have to steal the bomb? Do you think, I would steal it, if I knew it was a bomb? That baldy, Pinki is responsible for all this. But the cops think we're involved. But why is Pinki doing this? What do you mean? I mean Pinki... What about the bomb? Just forget about them. Think of our safety first. We can think about them at leisure. Will all the people in the city die? It's a neutron bomb, no one will survive. Can't we do anything? I think, we must do something. I was thinking the same. We've got to do something. - But Nandu, what can we do? What do you think? We can talk to the police. Yes, you're right. Let's go. We've always fought against the police and now you want to turn in our friends? What do you want? Should we let them kill, thousands of innocent people? Is this what we set out to do? You'll never understand this man, Pinki. He has gone mad. He will die and get us killed too. Suvarna, we're left with only one option. We must inform the police immediately. Police here. Tarzan, go and catch him. Hurry. Who were those two? - Who are you talking about? I'll break your legs, if you don't answer. Even if you kill me, I won't tell you, they were your boss. My boss? Yes, your boss. Intelligence officer. Intelligence officer.? Yes. Stay where you are! So what were those officers doing in the forest? They were on a tiger hunt. - A tiger hunt? Yes. - Go ahead. Behind - Go ahead. Behind. - What happened next? The tiger was running ahead of them. The tiger was running ahead of them? What happened after that? Both of them were chasing the tiger. But what were they doing in the forest? They were searching? - Searching? That lady officer's father, is a very great hunter. A very great hunter? - And the other officer... Yes. - His mother is a very great hunter. Even my father was a great hunter. Sir is here. Sir. He's mad. - What? He's absolutely crazy. If he stays here for some more time, he'll drive us crazy. Just let him go. Shree. - Yes. I think, Mr Nair is the mad one. That day, when we followed that couple, I told him they were going towards the city. You said, they had gone towards the hills. Yet, he asked you to take the road, while I was sent towards the hills. Since that day, I think he has gone mad. - I agree. He behaves like a mad man. - Shree, tell me one thing. It's possible, he's not mad, he's only pretending to be mad. It's quite likely that if we let him go... Listen. - Sir. You change into plain clothes and follow him. Catch him. Stop! Please! Let's go! Who shot you? Who are you? Who are you? - I... Pinki run! The police is here. - What happened? Let's run. Look, they got onto that double-decker bus. Turn to your right. Hurry. Move your silly vehicle. Ticket! Sir, ticket. I don't want. Please pay for the ticket. - I don't want a ticket. I said, pay up. Why should I pay? I don't want the ticket. Is he mad? Nobody moves. I said no one moves. If anyone moves, I'll throw him out of the bus like him. Do you get it? Oh god! Sit down, nobody moves. I say, sit down everybody. You keep driving. Sir... - Keep driving or I'll shoot you. Keep driving. I too am a citizen of this country, like you. There's no need to be afraid of me. Let's go to Delhi. Let's sing, dance and enjoy. Why don't we play the game of melodies? Tarzan, you may begin. No, I'll begin the game. "Oh my love, don't leave me" "Please don't leave me, my beloved" Sing a song starting with the alphabet 'd'. Sing. "Don't say a word" "Please don't say anything" - Sing. "Don't speak a word" - Sing along. "Please don't say anything" "What do we have to say?" "There is nothing I need to hear" Look for them. Tarzan, are you looking for them or counting the tyres of the bus? Search for them quickly or I'll send you back to the forest. Joseph, you drive the bus. - Pinki, this is a double-decker. I said, drive it. But I've never driven a a double-decker bus before. Fool, drive it like a three-wheeler. But how do I start it? Daya Shankar! Auto! Don't worry, I don't touch someone else's girlfriend. Besides, I do know about your love story. Hey! Do you want to hug your lover? Go, come on move. She's coming, have patience darling. You make a good couple. I was telling Tarzan, one must be willing to die for love. So tell me, are you ready to die or should I kill you? Ah! Nandu! Pinki, are you alive? You keep driving, I'll handle this. Rascal! - Hit him! Pinki! - You keep driving! Why don't you understand? I'll handle this. Tarzan. Hey, Pinki! Pinki! Don't move. - Bhawani. Don't move, - Nandu. Don't move! - Pinki! Pinki! Nandu, are you okay? Drive faster. Pinki, what happened to Tarzan? Pinki! Don't move. Were you driving a bus or a cart? That car was speeding and I lost control. Are you blind? You couldn't see the bridge! I forgot this was a double-decker bus. Lord! If I have more people like you in my gang, I'll never be a don. I want to be a famous don, do you get me? Don't move, or I'll shoot you. Wait there. Don't come to this side. Stay there, I'll come that way. Joseph, my friend, don't be afraid. Just hold your breath. I'll handle everything. Just hold your breath. Stop! Bhawani, if this rascal comes here, he'll kill both of us. Our intention was to stop him at any cost, even if that meant sacrificing our lives. Are you willing to co-operate? I love you. Me too. I beg of you, don't come this side, please. I request you, stay away. Rascals! Glory to Mother India! Rana, what I don't understand is, why did they lie to us that the box contained gold worth Rs 20 million? It was actually worth Rs 20 million. No, it was worth Rs 10 million. - No, it was worth Rs 20 million. But they said 10 million. Sir... It's very simple. Nandu was told it had gold worth Rs 20 million. Sir, I was telling him just that... - I know, that's what... Shut up! Nandu was informed it contained gold worth Rs 20 million, but Nandu himself didn't know, that the box contained a neutron bomb and not gold. Sir, please take this. Take this. It's the bomb. Please, forgive me. I really troubled you during interrogation, with the stories of the tiger hunt. After all, we were only trying to save our country. Please don't mind. Glory to India. Try to understand, Nandu too wasn't aware that... I'm glad that the inspector believed us. Otherwise, we would've been in great trouble. Finally, it's all over! I have a request to make, after you're married, you can go to Manali or Mussoorie for your honeymoon. But please don't come to my village. Why? I was only joking. Come to my village for your honeymoon. Bye, Daya Shankar. Mr Chako, I told you, my name is Bhawani. I shall always remember you as, Daya Shankar. Bye. - Bye. Bye. - Bye. Bye. - Bye. Bhawani - Yes. Now that we have decided to get married, why don't you tell me who you are? Who are your parents? Where do you live? Nandu, let's do it like this. First, you tell me and then I'll tell you. Hey! Why should I tell you? I asked you first. - Yes, I agree. But now, I'm asking you. But I was the first one to ask. But since I'm asking you now, you should answer first. Why do you always have it your way? Nandu, I'm warning you, it'll always be that way. Even after we're married, understand? Is that so? - Yes. Now come on tell me. Is that so? - Of course. You're always fighting with me, I'm leaving. Hey! All right, sometimes you may have it your way. That's better. Should I begin? Tell me. - Okay then, here it comes. Look, when I was a kid, I mean really small. My father was a great hunter!
