[SHOUTING] Shh, quiet here, quiet. Listen, I'm on. Shh. The oldest, most experienced player on the team and a big supporter of the drug abuse program, it must be frustrating to watch not only your teammates but other players in the league falling prey to cocaine and Percodan and the new so-called designer drugs. Well, you know I don't like drugs. And I feel bad for the people that use drugs. Do you think the drug test should be voluntary or involuntary? Uh, invol-- involuntary. I think they ought to make you take 'em. That's bullshit. That's bullshit. OK, no, listen to me. You think men have cornered the market on sports? I am so sick of your cowboy consciousness and your Negro arrogance. I have spent 13 years writing the copy that made your shit smell so good. You don't think I know what I'm talking about, right? Am I right? Oh, I'm sure you know what you're talking about. What concerns me is when you do you breathe? OK, go ahead, but listen to me. Mr. Buddy Wayne Harrison in there? Yeah, OK. Mr. Harris? Sometime. Two men in a limousine asked me to deliver this. You asshole, Harris. We thought there were women in there. They're here? Yes, sir. They're in the driveway. How you doing, buddy? My friend? Why don't you come and sit in my brand new plush limousine, huh? Come on, Hey, buddy, looking good, man. Tuxedo, cowboy hat. All right. I told you never to get this close to me. Relax. What the hell are you doing here? What the hell am I doing here? What the hell am I doing here? [CHUCKLING] Buddy, we came here to wish you good luck in Sunday's playoff games, man. To broaden our little business deals. Listen to me, you-- Don't you ever touch me. Don't you ever put your hands on me again! Now I'm gonna tell you how this motherfucker goes down, OK? Not only are you gonna take another package on that team plane to Los Angeles, man, but you're gonna throw Sunday's game. And you're gonna throw it very, very big. 10 points, no less! If you don't throw Sunday's game, you'll never throw a fucking football again. Ever again. You want me to cut your tendon here right now? You want me to cut your fucking tendon here right now? Please, don't cut me! Please! OK, man. [LAUGHTER] Hey, Ricardo, you wanna go to a hot shot football party, man? Huh? Yeah, get some dirty lady, huh? [LAUGHTER] Oh, come on, buddy. We're just kidding with you. Shit! Nobody has seen this kind of thing before, man. You know, when a guy gets in so deep he starts to lose his balls. He starts to lose his sense of humor too, man. [LAUGHTER] Come on, buddy, party. Come on, man. Cocaine from Colombia. Come on, let's do it. No, no. Oh, shit. Take this motherfucker. Get the hell out of my limousine. You're making me look bad. I don't want your balls blowing up on top of me, man. [LAUGHTER] That is the last time you ever tackle. Come here. No, no, no, no, no, no. Give me the ball. Here. Give me the ball. Give me the ball! - Harris! Give me the ball. Harris! Dave, come here. What, what? I wanna go back to the office. Fine, man, go back to the office. No, no. I want you to get me a ride. Ben, if there was a cab in this town, believe me, I would call one for you. Benjamin, Benjamin. Would you like to go back to the office with me? I could walk you back there. Perfect, yeah. Um, do you-- do you like ice tea? Oh. Oh, yeah. Because I have this wonderful herbal kind of ice tea. Well, Jose, I think it's just you, me, and Dave, huh? Don't forget that, Dave. Understand your loyalty. Perfect, huh? Oh, two more years here, huh? What the hell. Give me the ball, huh? Eddie. JJ (ON PHONE): I cannot believe it. I scored four touchdowns in one game, playing defense and offense. Isn't it great? BUDDY (ON PHONE): Yeah, it's great. But listen, you keep your grades up. You understand? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. No sweat. Hey, so if you're gonna go to the Super Bowl, you gonna fly me and Mom there? Absolutely. Let me talk to Mom, will you? Uh, yeah, OK. Hang on a second. She's outside. Gotta get her. Mom? Buddy? BUDDY (ON PHONE): Hi, Mom. How you doing? Oh, fine. We're so excited about-- are you OK? Is your arm all right? 100%, Ma. 100%! MOM (ON PHONE): So that means 75, right, honey? I'm fine, Ma. Are you taking the vitamins I sent you? I'm taking 'em twice a day, Ma. Ma, how do I contact Clete? Is he still in Honduras? What's wrong? BUDDY (ON PHONE): Nothing, Ma. I just wanna talk to him. I miss him. MOM (ON PHONE): Since when? Don't you dare lie to your mama. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hang on, Ma, there's somebody at the door. I'll be right there. Ma, I got gotta go. I'll-- I'll call you later. Buddy! BUDDY (ON PHONE): Ma, I'll be fine. I love you. I love you too. Take care. And remember, plenty of ice on that bad shoulder. BUDDY (ON PHONE): Bye-bye. Bye, son. I'm coming. Are you Mr. Buddy Wayne Harris? Yes, I am. Manuel said you have something for me. No! Ugh! COMMENTATOR: And so we come down to the 16th game of the season. Here comes a field goal unit on the field. There's 17 seconds left on the clock, and it is nail-biting time in Los Angeles. Rittenhof lines up with a field goal. This will be a 49 yard attempt. Blue 32, hut! COMMENTATOR: It's long enough. It's hooking, hooking! I don't believe it. It goes through! Hm? Sorry. The hawks win in double overtime! They'll go to the Silver Bowl! And we'll be back in the Dallas dressing room right after the break. Here, ladies. Gracias. Sorry. Thank you. And then it hit the upright and went on through. We got real lucky today. Congratulations, John. Let me get Buddy Wayne Harris. Buddy, Buddy. Here's the man who brought this team to the playoffs. Let's talk about your arm. You broke your heart yesterday in the shower. You had to miss the game today. Do you plan to come back to pro football? Uh, yeah, Jim. The doctor said that I'll be back next year no problem. So I'll be on top, and it's hard to keep a good man down. That son of a bitch! Goddamn it! He did it on purpose! Did you see that? He spit on us, man. He spit on us. Did you see how happy he was? Did you see how happy he was? He caught this whole game from the sideline. If this were soccer, he wouldn't betray us! But no. He is a white American football player. I'm gonna cut his throat! He cost me $3 million! Hombre, he cost me $3 million. OK, Carlos, I'll take care of it, man, OK? [BARKING] Buck, it's 8:00, Wednesday night. Channel three. Louie, Buck, Ernie, Fred the red! [LAUGHTER] [SINGING] [SCREAMING] Buddy! Buddy! Shut up, bitch! Buddy, how you doing, my man? [SINGING] [CHUCKLING] Buddy, is this your brother here, man? Huh, good looking boy? Bet you're really proud of him, bro? Bet you wanna grow up to be just like him, a footballer, huh? What's the matter, man? Cat got your tongue? BUDDY: Leave him out of this! Buddy, relax. We're gonna have a party here. [LAUGHTER] [SINGING] Hey, Buddy, who's this? This your mommy, Man Huh? Is this your mommy? Buddy, Mommy Harris. Mommy Harris, how are you? My name is Manuel de Cordoba. It's really a pleasure to meet you. Did you know, uh, me and Buddy were real good business associates? And, like this, good friends. You must be very proud of him. Everybody is fucking proud of you, Buddy. Your Mom, me, everybody. [SCREAMING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] BUCK: Buddy! [SCREAMING] You fucking piece of shit. You think I like to come over here and do business like that, huh? No! There's fucking blood all over the goddamn place. When you needed money, where did you go, huh, man? Did you go to fucking Bank of America? No! You came to us! You came to us. We treated you like family, man. But you forgot us, man. Didn't you, huh? Didn't you, Buddy? Didn't you, Buddy?

I'm home, honey. Who called? ROBERTA: Somebody from Washington. They said it was urgent. Am I in trouble? I don't know, Harris. It's on your message board. Well, wait a second. Wait a second. What did you tell 'em? - I told them-- CLETE: Where did you tell 'em I was? I told them that you were out on a call, all right? And I wanna tell you something. I am not gonna lie for you anymore. And I'm not gonna cover for you, all right? CLETE: Wait a second. You lied for me? Yes, I did. Roberta, I'm touched. I-- I don't know what to say. I'm speechless. Thank you. CLETE: You know, I was at the store today, and there was this little item right next to the cash register. And I thought of you, because I knew obviously you'd never seen anything like this. Are you kidding? What? No, razor blade, uh-huh? See, what you do is, you scrape the hair out of your armpit. Really, try it. You know something, Harris, you are so sick, you know? You're the most superficial shallow person I've ever met. Well, thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. OK. And you know something else, Harris? You know, while you're off surfing and-- and playing soccer and exploiting every woman in this village, I am keeping this office together. You know, Berta, you are looking so indigenous. Will you make the call? I gotta go to the airport this afternoon. All right? CLETE: Well, that's great. You should get out of here as much as you possibly can. Oh, I forgot. Got a new word. New word? "Deodorante." You do it after you shave. [BEEPING] [SIGHING] Do not send children for alcohol. [BEEPING] Ben, how are you? Honduras is hell. Not very good, man. I don't know quite how to tell you this. The company figures since we go back a ways, I should be the one to call. Your mother and your brothers have been killed. It's real ugly. JJ Harris, Mimi Harris, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Amen. Let us go in peace. Thank you. Thank you very much. Sorry for your loss. Clete, my name is Carol Chase. I was very close to your brother. I'm sorry. Thank you for that. Um, listen, if you're going to be in town a while or if I can do anything, please call. Thank you very much. Bob. Clete, we-- we offer our deepest condolences. They will be missed. Oh, oh. I'm sorry. Sheriff, we understand that you have a suspect? Yeah, that's true. We have one suspect in custody who's confessed to the crime. You know, off the record, I think we've got this thing pretty well wrapped up. Well, I appreciate it, Sheriff. Thank you. - You bet. You spell that name right too. Don't worry. I will. [SIGH] Hi, my name is Clete Harris. I'm-- Bo Dean? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Long time, Charlie. Well, Clete, I got everything you asked for. But I wanna warn you of something. Some of these pictures are pretty damn graphic. I wouldn't look at 'em if I was you. Nobody needs to remember their loved ones like that. You're probably right. You get the reports too? It's all there. I wanna see 'em, Charlie. Now, I don't think that's a good idea. No, no, no. I need to see 'em. Yeah. Bubba, get that sleazebag out of the cell and put him in the quiet room. Thank you, Charlie. Appreciate it. I'm warning you, son, you keep your hands off him or we're both in big trouble. All right, you wanna rough him up a little, go ahead. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry! You expect me to buy this, Charlie? Now, Clete, I know you're a little upset. He didn't do it, and you know it. Hell, I got a confession, man! For Christ sakes, Charlie, you've been getting people to confess to all sorts of bullshit the past 25 years. Goddamn it, he's got a record as long as your arm. The man's raped three women! Now, you listen to me. You listen to me! Now, that piece of white trash didn't kill my family. Nobody killed my family! They were executed, Charlie. And you know it. I thought you Peace Corps types were nonviolent, boy! Well, there are all kinds of ways of keeping the peace. You should know that, Charlie. Now, why don't you unlock the door and let me outta here? And while you're at it, get him outta here too. Jesus Christ. CLETE (ON PHONE): Code, Alpha, omega, agent 503. Access, Ben Waxman. OPERATOR: Yes, sir. I'll punch you through. [PHONE RINGING] CLETE (ON PHONE): Ben, Clete. Yeah, hey, look, I'm sorry about the funeral. No, that's fine. Look, did you get those pictures? Yeah. CLETE (ON PHONE): You're not gonna believe this. The goddamn sheriff down here is claiming it's robbery related. Look, my friend, I need a favor. Look, Clete, you know the policy. I could get my ass in a sling. Besides, this is the wrong number for this type of conversation. I'm in a payphone. Ben. Yeah, but you're not thinking about me. CLETE (ON PHONE): Of course, I am. I mean, what's the worst thing that's gonna happen to you? You're gonna end up for two years in Honduras with me. I mean, it's the Sun City of Central America. You'd love it. It'd be good for you. Look, I know what you must be going through, but I can't! CLETE (ON PHONE): Look at the pictures, Ben. I saw them. No, look at the goddamn pictures! That's my family! I saw them, Clete! CLETE (ON PHONE): Well, you and I both know that's drugs, right? I mean, I think my little brother was into a lot more than touchdowns, wouldn't you say? Look, Ben, all I'm asking is that you run an RJ-47. That's all. Real simple. All right, I'll see what I can do. But I'm gonna send you a K2. And next time, goddamn it, use it! [BUZZING] [LAUGHTER] What's that? No! GTO! No, baby, that's an Impala. What? It's an Impala. Oh, God, if this is a GTO, I swear to God right now. I swear to you. I'll trade it in tomorrow, but it'll work for today, won't it? Oh, God, yes. What? Do you want me to go in there with you? - Yeah, I can't wait. - Come on. - Really? - Yeah. No, no, no. Listen, listen, listen. Before we go any further, I just wanted to tell you how beautiful your hair is, and that it reminds me of wheat fields. Oh, my daddy was a farmer. He raised melon. God, aren't they something? Come in, Tokyo. [BUZZING] [MOANING] I gotta go, baby. It's been fun. Uh-huh. [LAUGHTER] I'd like to speak with one of your ladies. Yo quiero una-- I want the kind that spanks me. WOMAN (ON PHONE): I'm sorry, sir. We operate on a credit card basis only. What you want is an outcall service. Well, what are you? WOMAN (ON PHONE): This is a phone fantasy sex line. No intiendo! What the hell does that mean? WOMAN (ON PHONE): Thank you very much. MAN (ON PHONE): Aw, go to hell, lady! Vieja mensa. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? CLETE (ON PHONE): Hi, this is Clete Harris. Oh, hi. How are you? I'm OK. Look, I came into Dallas today to pick up some things at Buddy's apartment. You didn't know your brother very well, did you? You know, Buddy wasn't really into a lot of things. Clothes, maybe. Right, well, what I was thinking is that there might be, uh, something at the apartment you wanna keep or something belonged to you. Oh, thanks. That's very sweet of you, but no, there's nothing I can think of. Well, OK, um. Well, look, it's-- it's real nice to talk to you again. Clete, would you like to get together for a drink when I get off work? Yeah, yeah. I was hoping you'd ask. Great. Um, I get off at 6:00. And with traffic, I could meet you, say, 7:00? That's fine. Where? How about Randy's on Knoll? It's a dance club. A lot of the players go there too. OK, Randy's on Knoll. All right, I'll see you there. OK. Yeah, I want some lunch. Hamburgers, steak, baked potatoes, and a beer. [DOORBELL RINGING] Who is it? You called out? - Yeah, enter. - Yeah. Put the shit over there on the table. We've got your hamburger steak well done, potatoes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, man. Hey, you got change for a $100 bill, man? Oh, man, what the-- Get on your fucking knees. Man, you want my money, man? Get on your fucking knees. Fucking knees. You listen to me, you little bastard. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. You ready? You remember the ranch house, hm? Old woman and her two boys? Yeah? Uh-huh. Guess what? Guess what? Oh, stop it! Outside! I enjoy this, you chump. [SCREAMING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SCREAMING] Not bad, huh? It's-- it's nice. - Hi. - Hi, how y'all doing? Very good. Do you want another drink? No, I think I'll change. How about some wine. Two glasses of wine. OK, what kind would y'all like? Um. How about a white zinfandel? Yeah, white wine. That'd be perfect. Thank you. - Thank you very muchh. All right. So are you going back to Brazil? Brazil? No, it's Honduras. Sorry. So are you going back there? Yeah, eventually. I'm on a leave of absence right now. It must be fascinating. Honduras? Yeah, yeah. So exactly what do you do? Well, I guess-- I guess you could say I'm a part time doctor. I know how to put a Band-Aid on a kneecap that's been scraped. Part time school teacher. But to tell you the truth, most of the time I'm knee deep in manure, trying to get things to grow so the people there can feed themselves. God, there's such a difference between you and Buddy. I know. When we were growing up, people used to say that I had a messiah complex because I was out to save the world, and that he had a hero complex because he was out to beat the world. Yeah. So, uh, how about you and Buddy? Were you, uh-- Well, I was in love with Buddy. But the problem was, so was everybody else. We went together on and off for a while. I proposed to him a few times. There was one night when he actually accepted. By the time he sobered up the next day, he'd forgot. Yeah, that's my brother Buddy. Mm-hm. WAITRESS: Here you go. Ah, thank you. You're welcome. No, we-- we wanted white. That-- that's the killer it's supposed to be. - Oh. - Enjoy. Thanks. Thanks. This is white wine. Yeah. Well, to your health. [SINGING] [LAUGHTER] This is nuts! I'm outta here. [SINGING] Non-descript secretary's car. Uh-huh. Yeah. Can I open the door for you? Yes, sir. Got it? There you are. You know, this was truly one of the loveliest evenings I've had in a long time. You're kidding? I have nights like this all the time. Bullshit. Yeah. Well, listen, I gotta go out of town for a little while to eye up a few things, but if I come back here, I'd like to call you or something, maybe see you again, if that's all right? Yeah, I think that's all right. - Yeah? - Yeah. Thank you. Good night. Good night. [PHONE RINGING] Clete? Dallas was very fulfilling, Ben. Did you locate the operative down in New Orleans yet? You're gonna love this guy. Codenamed "Popeye." Do you believe it? Real Neanderthal but good. uh, location 25 miles west of New Orleans, Napoleonville, 27 route one number six, Randy's Funk and Junk. I got Randy's what and Junk? BEN (ON PHONE): Funk and Junk. Funk and Junk. Got it? The future's looking bright, but I wanna hear from you in three days. You bet, buddy. Be well. You the Harbormaster? Are you Popeye? That's right. Randy's the name. Pleasure. You like some? No. No, thank you. At ease, soldier. Take your troops and resume your patrol. And see that we're not disturbed. Yes, sir! Too much fucking TV, you know what I mean? Yeah. Now, Ben filled me in about your family. It's the goddamn hard drugs is what it is. Come on, I'll show you what I got. You can show me your shopping list. Listen, I'm looking for some underwater demolition equipment. I got that. A Sig P226 would be lovely. I got that too. That's my favorite weapon. Good. And here's what I'd like to show you. You could really use one of these. This is the Barrett Light 50. It's got a range of 14,000 feet. It fires high explosive 50 caliber bullets. Ah. Look at that plane body over there. How about that? That's-- uh, you know, Randy, I think that's a little too much for what I need right now. But very impressive. Well, come on, let's move on, then. Randy, I need a map of the bayous. I got plenty of those. And a boat? I got any kind of boat you need. Great. How soon can I get everything? Wait a minute. Is that all you want? Yeah, for now, that's fine. No, no, no. Come here. You gotta have one of these. Well, um-- This is a great killer in a little package. It's a PRB Khalid. You can take out a medium tank or burn down a small building with this versatile little jewel. Fires a red phosphorus grenade. Better killing through chemicals. Know what I mean? Come on with me. [CHUCKLING] How'd you like that one? That's great. That's good. I know, I know. But you can't use any of it. Somebody around here's gotta need some of this shit. Yeah. Listen, I don't know if Ben told you, but I'm gonna need an extra pair of hands. You got any suggestions? You got 'em. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm already bought and paid for, compliments of Ben's computer. You-- you got a telephone here? You can use the phone in town. Ben won't be in his office till 2:00. Deal? Yeah. All right. RANDY (ON PHONE): Clete, this is Randy. OK, everything's all set. If you can tear yourself away from the local talent, I've got you a boat that ought to do the trick. You'll find it at pier 7, slip 16. All right, Randy. Hurry up, let's go. What's that fool think he's doing? What the hell? You son of a bitch! Get me that thing now! You hurry up and get this motherfucker going! But that gun away, son of a bitch! You motherfucker! Come on! Come on! [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Come on, come on! Jesus, you are one hard son of a bitch. Who are you? [GUNSHOTS] [SCREAMING] Seriously, my father was German, and I suppose my birth put an end to the pure race. Thank God. Gracias. Compromiso. Goddamn it, will you listen to me? Now, I gave you my word I would not touch Carlos Hendel in this country. Didn't I say that? Look, I had the son of a bitch in my sights. I'm gonna know in 15 minutes. Ben, I'm gonna know in 15 minutes if I chase him outta here. Jesus, Ben, there's a lot more to life than a retirement fund! All right, fine. Bye. Damn bureaucrats. Where the hell is Mike? I thought you quit smoking. Gimme that. [SPEAKING SPANISH] You're his parent. That's-- Hold up. No, if I was-- Shut up! [BOAT APPROACHING] I think I hear the soldier coming now. Well, now that Hendel's headed south, we can go get him. Look, Randy, you helped me out today, and I appreciate it. That's what you hired me for. You're through, aren't you? I've seen that look before. We're not going south, are we? I'll see you. Randy? Ah. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Morning. Hi. How are you? Listen, you know, I-- I had this great idea that, uh, it would be very romantic to come over here and cook you breakfast, but-- Morning. Hi. Morning. Morning. How you doing? Oh. Look at this. All right. I must look terrible. How about-- no, you look fine. Oh, well. Here, have a grape. We got oranges. Good for you. Here. How'd you sleep? I slept. I slept. I don't know. I was sleeping. I don't know how I slept. That's good. Listen, I'm sorry about just barging in last night, you know. I thought maybe-- - It's all right. Good morning. So. So? What are you gonna do? About what? OK, what are you gonna do with the rest of the day? Rest of the day? Well, first of all, I'll get the clothes out of my car. And if you let me, I'm gonna take a shower and maybe use your toothbrush. Maybe. Maybe. [CHUCKLING] And then I gotta go to my brother's apartment, take care of that. Then spend the rest of the day with you, what do you say? Hi, guys. Jesus, you scared the hell out of me. I knew you were coming. I told Randy! What are you doing? How are you? - Good. Yeah, look. - Wow. - Yeah. Hey, hi, Clete. Welcome back. Thanks. Mikey said you'd be coming back. Yeah, well, I guess he knew, huh? Yeah. Why don't you break that down and clean it for me, all right? You bet. How's business? Booming. Mm-hm. Who cuts your hair? Randy. Yeah, I thought so. Listen, don't you think-- don't you think you should be in school today? I am. I mean real school, like where you learn how to read and write. The three R's? What, do you think I'm stupid? Stupid? I know how to read and write. I just don't think you should grow up so fast. Well, what do you say? Ready? Wait a sec. Sit down. You're not thinking about taking Mikey with us, are you? What, are you crazy? I can't go. I'm just a kid. So how's your Spanish? My Spanish is good. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING IN SPANISH] [SINGING IN SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Listen, do you hear it? You hear it? What? The quiet. Ah. Shh. [URINATING] Hey, let's go. Hey, you know where you're going? Right. Hey, Clete, what do you do in Honduras? Listen. No, no. I'm a listener. I listen to things. What do you listen for? Anything. Anything that's of interest to Washington. That sounds kind of, uh-- Boring, yeah. No, relaxing. Is that why you picked Honduras? To relax? No, no, Randy. I didn't pick Honduras. Oh, that's right. They sent you. [CHUCKLING] I was doing this job about two years ago, and they accused me of going too far. You know what I mean, too far? No, I've never been that far. Right. So what is it with Mikey? You just leave him there to watch Junk and Funk all alone? No, it's Funk and Junk. And he's not alone. He's got the troops with him. - The geese? Uh-huh. You probably didn't know, but geese's hearing is 10 times more acute than any dog in the world. No shit. Mm-hm. All right. We look good. We look tough. We look like we know what we're doing. Where's the chopper? Trust me. Trust you? Right around the corner. Ah, right around the corner. That's it. There aren't any corners in the jungle. Oh, damn, damn, get this. [CHUCKLING] I told you I'd find it. Randy, I never doubted it. Water! What we got here is a Lauper FT4 fully armored attack helicopter. The underbelly assigned to this buggy can take direct hits from either large machine guns or grenades. Special engine gives it an operational ceiling of 30,000 feet. How about that? It's even got Pfeiffer air-to-ground missiles. I love it! Randy, do you think this is gonna hold me? Yeah, that's why we mounted the 50 over here. Counterbalancer. Oh, counterbalance. Trust me. Everything's in the invoice. Even more than what we bargained for. All right. Let's go. Come on. Wait a minute. I wanna get familiar with these gauges. They put 'em in different places in different models. No, wait a second, wait a second. Are you screwing with me? I mean, you've flown-- you've flown a model like this before, haven't you? They're all the same, basically. Basically. Trust me. You're screwing with me, aren't you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Grotto's coming up. Get ready. Where's my body armor? It's in the bag. No, it's not in the bag! It's on the invoice. It's gotta be in the bag. Fine, don't worry about it. The air's getting thin. Better get into your gear. OK, we're at 18,000 feet. Stand at that door. Now, remember, no stuff. Go in, kill 'em, and get out. I'll pick you up at daybreak, like we planned. Don't worry about the chute. I got the guarantee in my pocket. [CHUCKLING] Go. Well, they say there's one born every minute. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [APPLAUSE] Mis amigos, it has become a tradition here that, on the eve of the cocaine harvest, we celebrate our good fortune, and we ask that God shine his light on the leaf of the coca bush, that our country may continue to grow and prosper. And we have prospered. [APPLAUSE] Through our efforts and constant vision we have seen our children educated, our mortality rate decrease, proper medical care, highways, our highway, villages, our villages, cities, and the hearts of our people swell with pride. The last 10 years, we have seen our problem become second to none in the world. Not even Juan Valdez and his coffee bean can compete with us. [APPLAUSE] The hearts of our people swell with pride. So on this very special occasion, I thank God for our good fortune. I pray for peace. I thank Colonel Santos for the protection he provides for us. And last but not least, we thank General Arsenio for the convicts he provides to work in the fields. [SINGING] But most of all, I thank you, all of you, for your support and for your friendship. A la amistad. Salut. Salut, a la amistad. Bravo! [SINGING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] As always. [SPEAKING SPANISH] I'm going to bed, and I don't want to be disturbed unless it's absolutely necessary. Yeah. The party was a huge success. Everyone asked about you. They send their love, of course. They hope you recover soon. Here, drink this. It should help you to feel better. Looks like that little malady of yours is just jet lag and not malaria. It's tonic water. It helps to bring the fever down. Now, about that little favor you owe me. [GROANING] Oh, right there. It feels wonderful. Here you go-- Move! Not one word. Whoever hired you, whatever they're paying you, I'll pay double. I'll pay triple. You wanna know who hired me, hm? You wanna know who hired me? My family. My mother and my little brothers, you freak! Yes, that was unfortunate. My men exceeded their authority. Shut up. Shut-- shut up! Don't you dare try and negotiate with me. You beg, you little bastard. Beg, come on. I too know the pain of losing-- You know nothing. You know shit. Your brother was gunned down. I know the pain of losing a family. Now talk to me. Shut up, shut up. Please, please, please, come on, say it. Please. That's not enough. Say it. Take the belt and put it around you right now. Very good. Good boy, huh? Put the guns down. You don't stand a chance. You think it's our fault your family's dead? Uh-uh. Blame your brother. Nobody twisted his arm. Your brother was a loser. Blame him, not us. Fire, goddamn you! Fire! [GUNFIRE] [GUNFIRE] What the hell are you doing here? Please, let me in! All right. Clete, where are you? Me and this guy aren't going home without you. [GUNFIRE] [PANTING] I can't see. I can't see. Do me, please. Do me, please. [SOBBING] Do yourself. Do yourself. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [CLICKING] [SHOUTING] Hang in there. Can't you see I was busy? [GUNFIRE] We can talk. I know we can talk! [GUNFIRE] [GUNFIRE] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Thanks for the body armor, eh? [SHOUTING] RANDY: Clete, I'm gonna blow that turret into the compound. You'll see it. I'm gonna light up the whole place. I want-- I want you to show yourself, asshole. [BEEP] What a beautiful morning. I sure hope it stays that way. [GUNFIRE] Clete, I've got you spotted, buddy. I'm coming in. I'm making one pass. Make it good. [GUNFIRE] Come on, come on. Come here. Hang on. We're outta here. We're almost even, you son of a bitch! Where are you taking me? North! North? America? No, north, go! Now we're even! [SCREAMING] [MUSIC PLAYING] SONG: Who is she? Where's she coming from? Man, she's hot. I ain't never seen one like her so far. Be with her one night. Just one night. My life never would be the same. Come on. She's a star. She's a queen. She stepped out of a dream. Oh, what a lady. Just her walk gives me chills. She's got awesome sex appeal. Wish she was my baby. Oh, that look in her eyes make the fans fantasize. She's got a lot. Shake the hair, her toes, such a lovely centerfold. The girl is hot. Dream girl, where did she come from? What's her name? Dream girl, I wonder if she knows that she's driving me insane. To watch her dance takes my breath. I just can't help myself. She moves so nasty. She's got X-rated moves. Not too shy, yet so cruel. Really classy. Human eyes have never seen what she does to a pair of jeans. It's outrageous. If she granted me the right, I would love her day and night. She's so contagious.
