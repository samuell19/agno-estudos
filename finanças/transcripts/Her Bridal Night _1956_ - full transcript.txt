This film was restored by pathe in 2019 The bride is much too beautiful Long live the newlyweds! Judith... Darling, at last! - At last what? - Yalu zangbu. - What? - Yalu zangbu. - Sure? - Certain. Read it. Jérbme signed it. He's giving me my freedom. Darling, I can marry you! Yet it had all begun fairly well. One Thursday, two years ago, I had a date with a guy, the notary's son. Dedé laurentin wasn't very handsome or bright, but all my friends dated, I didn't want to be left out. Waiter! A lemonade. May I, miss? Let me introduce myself: Judith aurigault, director of love of life. Ever been called sleeping beauty? Well, you look exactly like sleeping beauty. I'll explain. We're doing a series around here on perrault's fairy tales. We hired a model, but she fell ill today. We must replace her. She's perfect. Very amusing. Is she our beauty? For beauty, he agreed right away. That's all I understood, but I didn't want to annoy him. Or annoy aunt Yvonne and aunt Agnes. Everyone approved of me. We all piled into the fancy car to go to fontaine. What amused me the most was dédé laurentin's face. I waved him goodbye, I never saw him again. The interview was cordial but complicated. Judith tried to explain, my aunts tried to understand. It wasn't so easy. "Cover-qgirl"? "Girl", I understand. - But "cover"? - A cover. A magazine cover, naturally. Girls who pose for fashion magazines. One of the top women's professions. - Right, Michel? - Indisputably. Believe me, ladies... Mesdemoiselles, it's a profession with a future. Cover girls can have dazzling careers, become movie stars, marry millionaires. - Right, Michel? - Indisputably. I'll get to the point. My magazine is doing a series set in local chateaux on perrault's fairy tales, their morality is... Indisputable. - Indisputable. - In short... We spotted your niece earlier, she's exactly right to play sleeping beauty. Catherine! It will be respectable? Love of life is a family magazine. You must have read it. I have. I buy it every week, for the agony aunt. - Sandrine! - Get on with your jam. So what about Catherine? My god! If you agree, we'll contact her parents, her mother... Our sister is dead. Let's say he's dead. So she will be the child of love of life. My aunts blushed, probably thinking like me, it would be a big honor for a mere love child. If you agree, I do too. Catherine is a special child. She loves solitude, silence... She can be the girl who is silent. - As if she's thinking! - Absolutely. Young lady, would you like to be photographed? - Yes... - Good. Tony. Great! The prettiest smile of the season. Fine. Another one. Lovely. I'm never wrong, the girl is gifted. Two weeks later, sleeping beauty woke up in Paris. Judith began sending me to school. Modeling school, naturally. Today you'll be presenting an evening gown. Rosaline! You have a train, long gloves, and a tiara. What do you think? Not bad for a beginner. For ready-to-wear maybe, not haute couture. Catherine, concentrate. You appear... Showing the dress off to its best... The accessories... Fine. Spin around. Perfect. Now come back. The gaze much higher. Never look the buyers in the face, always over their heads. Good. Judith was right. You're very gifted. Last night I had a terrific idea. The theme of our collection edition: News media. Radio, movies, television... Great! I know the French broadcasting studios. It'll be a success. - And the press! - Contact the major magazines. Mock-up 415 June issue 32 pages b/w, 32 pages in color recto verso, 32 pages 4 colors verso, black recto. Like it? - And this? - Very much. Give me more relief. More shadow. Center it. Violet and magenta. Perfect. And what font? Single space with 3 point, the caption in italics, same font. It's you. What's the matter? Judith rejected your sketches? So? Do something for you? Whatever you want. Except using bad sketches in the magazine. I haven't seen them but if Judith rejected them they must be bad. No, sorry, nothing doing. You're asking what's the point? There is no point! Lucile. What did she say that's so funny? I refused to side with her about her sketches. So she said: "What's the point..." - Of sleeping with you? - Yep. I understand her, I ask that too. Ask what's the point? I have no answer. Why do we all love you? A mystery. - To kill time! - That's it! To think I'm marrying you... It will go fine, you'll see. We're two civilized beings, we should reqularize our situation. And we have a child. - A child? - Love of life. What do you think of the new issue? A success, naturally. You do everything so well. The magazine, making love, inflicting pain. Am I disturbing you? No. Just making the last corrections. Look, it's your number. Like it? I don't know. Are you satisfied with it? Very. Your face will go far. How far? To my office. To sign your contract. Sit down. You can sign with your eyes shut. It's too much! Jéréme left Borneo again. My letter came back. Who's jérome? The invisible man. Talked about, never seen. Judith's husband. How witty. Marriage is nothing, divorce is something else. By the way. We must find a name for the kid. I have a name. Catherine isn't a name. How about "chouchou"? "Chouchou"? It's a bit dumb, no? Not so dumb, it will make us famous. Right, Michel? I like "Catherine". It's old fashioned. "Chouchou" is fresh, it's trivial. It will suit her fine. She thinks I'm stupid. No, she likes you a lot. Everybody does. Everybody is nobody. And me? And Tony? Marc? And the readers? Sign it. Chouchou was born. I was no worse off for it, I accepted philosophically all the tribulations of the trade. This water is drenching me! It's freezing! It tickles, stop! I can tickle you! Stop! What's the matter? Marc is bothering me. Don't play the innocent maiden. I don't like being touched. The things you hear! The main thing is that you heard them. - Ready, Tony? - I'm ready. (Go on then. One thing led to another, from showers to sun, I became famous. - She's a star? - Who? The girl over there. No, that's chouchou. She poses. She's pretty. Very pretty. But she's starting to overwhelm us. Girls do their hair like her, dress like her, wear shoes like her. All women will look like her. I pray god hears you! Paris life suited me very well. That day I treated myself, as I often did, fo one of those cozy evenings I love. May I come in? In bed already? Are you sick? No, on the contrary. What's up? I'm inviting you to dinner. With you? Me, Judith and durant-beaulieu. Durant-beaulieu? Then I'll stay in. I know how you feel. It's so nice here. Then stay. Coffee with bread and jam. I wish I could but this dinner is important. Your dinners always are, but you don't even eat. In life one must choose: Make money or eat jam. Fix me a slice. - With butter or jam? - Both. - Greengages? - Yes, from fontaine. - Spread it all over. - You're so fussy! - Spread it evenly. - Here. Thank you. We're fine here. It's good. Michel, what do you like in life? In life? Everything. A typical male answer. "Everything". Meaningless! We can't love everything at once. Everyone loves a little something, and that's what makes us love all the rest. Isn't that life? If I follow your reasoning, I like eating jam on a young girl's bed. So I like all jam, all beds and all young girls. That can go far. You're such a dummy! Do you like sitting on a park bench? Gosh, it's been ages since I sat on a park bench. Why? Because you don't know how to live. I know all the benches in Paris. I'll show you them. One night, I'll cook you a real dinner. Face to face? - Very dangerous. - Why? One of the two always loses face. Really? And what if it was you? Lord, it's Judith! I forgot about her. What are you doing? Eating jam before caviar now? She's still in bed? Chouchou? - Are you sick? - No, I'm fine. Hurry up, we're taking you to dinner. No, she prefers greengages. How stupid. You must be bored alone. Me? I'm never bored. But other people sometimes... What's that mean? She's never bored, but people bore her sometimes. How subtle. Not only does she know the art of silence, but of speech too, and not just chatter. Good night. See you tomorrow. Durant-beaulieu adores pretty women. Still not tempted? No, I'd rather be alone. You'll end up married. She's a half-wit, don't insist. Excuse me, your gloves! Thanks. Do count me as a friend, I'll let you. I prefer it when it happens spontaneously. You're friends with Michel. That's not the same. It certainly is. You'll soon discover it's exactly the same. She didn't have to insist. Everyone knows that Judith and Michel... They're a couple whose ideas are so broadminded that everyone gets lost in them. Michel, it's time. It's you? I'm ready. Excuse me, work calls. She's proposing a novel. We'll continue our discussion later. Sure. Goodbye. You don't mind kissing a girl in front of everyone? But everyone is no one. And the bartender? The cashier? And me? You... I know I don't count, but still... I can't imagine how you can just kiss anyone like that. Anyone? Did you take a look at her? Better than you did, you were too close. You see, a little affair occasionally is restful. If Judith had surprised you, you'd be in a spot. No, Judith understands, she knows it's unimportant. She shuts her eyes. It's her way of seeing. Absolutely. I wonder if you really love her. Who, Judith? Of course I love her. Then why? There's Judith and the others. Judith counts, the others don't. Understand? No. I don't think I'll ever understand. "Men are all liars, fickle, "chatterboxes, hypocrites, conceited, cowardly, "contemptible and sensuous. "Women are all vain, curious, "shallow, depraved. "The world is one big bottomless sewer "where formless seals crawl and twist on mountains of muck. "But there's one thing in the world that is simple and sublime, "the union of these imperfect beings..." Who's your friend? The one bantering over there. "Often unhappy... "But we love! "And at our graveside, "we look back and we say: "I've suffered often, I was wrong at times. "But I have loved." Thank you, sir. We'll contact you. Next! Patrice, I want you to meet my boss, Mr. bellanger, editor-in-chief of love of life. Quiet, please! What are you doing now? Leaving. I've been turned down. - What if I offer you a part? - What sort? Silent. I need a cover-boy for the magazine. That's not a part, it's a cover. Earn some pocket money. Tony, it's kind of you but no. - Why, don't you like it? - Nope. I'm easy-going, but playing the clown... I consider myself an actor. This is about acting. We want to create a couple to publicize our magazine. Once the readers have adopted them, we can launch fashion, cooking, everything women go for. I'm sorry, I can't. You'd be working with some lovely girls. Are you done? Let's go. I offered perdican a job: Not interested. Chouchou would have been your partner. - Hello. - Delighted. And sorry. Sure you won't regret this? Yes, dead sure. Too bad. Goodbye. Goodbye. Tony! Changed your mind? No. Tell them I accept. We started living a curious idyll. Love of life became our family photo album in a way. Always attractive, well dressed, we embellished life for people who couldn't afford to live their dreams. Seaside, swimming pool, mountains or monte-Carlo, ritzy holidays or a cozy stay. The motor show, travels abroad. The banks of the seine, walks in the woods, the riding club. The opera, the theater. Swanky first nights. We were pros. A series of commercials for stockings was our consecration as a couple. Cut! She's marvelous. Marvelous! You can change stockings for the next scene. So you still like the idea? Yes. And you've brought it to life beautifully. What is the young lady's name? Chouchou. Chouchou... how delightful. May I go and tell her? (Go ahead. Hello, miss. I am Guillaume designy, sighful stockings. Congratulations. Likewise, sir, you make lovely stockings. Your legs make them look even lovelier. You're adorable, have you been told that? Yes, sir, so don't put yourself out. Excuse me. I don't like that man. That man is a client worth 500 million. I don't like him. It's me again! What do you want, Mr. designy? Just to give you a token of my admiration and if you allow me, let me prove it with some trinkets you may find pretty. Do you like necklaces? With your name engraved on the tag? No, thanks. Mr. designy is very obliging. And interested in youth. He's taking me to dinner with the postal minister. Jérdbme was sighted in java. As a favor from the minister, my lawyer can serve him a writ by telegram. A breakthrough in case law. And the postal service. Leaving already? Yes, I have pressing priorities and I've wasted too much time. - Goodbye, my dear. - Goodbye. Goodbye, sir. I bet chouchou goofed again. I'm sure she did. I heard everything. You handled it brilliantly. What happened with designy? I understood what he wanted and vice versa. At least it was clear! Well done, chouchou! Clear as daylight. You three are nuts. Designy barely said goodbye to me, and I need him. Chouchou, what did you say to him? It's hard to repeat, ma'am, but it was to the point. One can save face without creating a scene. You may lose love of life 30 million. When men start giving me funny looks I don't like it. You discourage me at times. It's unhealthy to be so prudish. Ridiculous! And rare. Patrice, stay out of this, dear. Places! Rehearsal! Michel, don't you agree? No, absolutely not. Everyone ready, everyone in place. We'll rehearse. Maestro, playback. I don't understand your position. Patrice defends chouchou as he's in love with her... - What did you say? - But you... No, about patrice. He's in love with chouchou. They're living it for real. They really do seem to be made for each other. - Don't you think? - Possibly. You dance so well. I love dancing. It lets me do everything I don't dare do in life. I enjoy being with you. You don't miss Camille or céliméne? I'll always have them, they're eternal. Whereas you, if you wanted to understand... Understand what? Nothing. He wanted to play a lover. He's doing it. - Are you going? - Yes. I've seen enough for today. Come in. Here are sylvie's photos. How did your shoot go? Very well. You don't look like it did. Is something wrong? Anything wrong, Michel? No, I'm fine. Say, about chouchou and patrice... Yes? Remember what I said? Yes. But after thinking it over, I don't believe it. Wake up, Michel. Chouchou isn't a child. Wise virgins don't last forever. Those two gave me a terrific idea. I'll marry them. Judith, mind your own business. It will make a great feature! Ah, a feature! Of course. I wouldn't set up a real marriage. I have enough trouble with ours. Poor darling. If only I could find jérébme. He was last seen in Tibet, near yalu zangbu. We've come for our orders. Hot news, kids. You're getting married. I'll bring in the fashion world. A truly Parisian wedding. Held in the country, of course. In beautiful fontaine. We need her aunts' permission. Don't worry. Patrice, I hope you're happy. Sure I am. That's what I'm paid for. Good evening. What's his problem? Well? What are you thinking about? Nothing. You never think about nothing. But it's so photogenic. If you're upset, tell us. Aren't we nice to you? Yes, very. Are you tired? No. Wouldn't you like to marry patrice? - Sure. - Perfect. The trousseau you'll have! Millions of readers will drool over it. This marriage seemed a fine idea at first, but on reflection, no. Why not? From the publicity angle, you destroy the couple. Readers are used to them, but once married, they'll be worthless. - Are you sure? - It's obvious. Know why I planned this marriage? Do tell me. To see your reaction. Well, you've seen it. Exactly. Hello? Ah, it's you. Pierre, dear, I wanted to talk to you. Make me a wedding dress. A wedding dress like no one's ever seen. A dream, a poem in white. See what I mean? Our engagement wasn't long. Love of life saw to everything. We just sat back and watched. The day before the day, Michel drove me there with Tony and Marc. Patrice had an audition, he was joining us later. We reached fontaine about 3 pm. It's always nice to be back home. With my aunts Agnes and Yvonne, and everyone. While Michel and Tony checked out the village, I quickly rediscovered my kingdom. I went to swim in the river below our terrace. I lay in the sun for ages, on the green grass at the water's edge. That's enough sun for today. You're already red. I blush sometimes but I never get sunburnt. - Did it go well? - Very well. We have all we need. The villagers are thrilled to attend. It's a pity patrice isn't with us, he'd have had a few hours holiday too. Do you trust me? Yes. Do you have a secret? A secret? That's usually something we can't keep. And if we do manage to keep it? Then it's more serious. Michel, you can trust me too. You know me inside out. Nothing is hidden. This feels so good. Yes, it does. Are you asleep? Me too. It's patrice! Chouchou, the love of life technical team bent over backwards in your honor for a commemorative gift. No! How lovely! Yes, it's lovely, fun and horribly expensive. But we know you love pretty things. A music box! I've always wanted one. With 18th century Springs. You're all adorable. You bet. Wait, let's see. It plays such a cute little song. Careful. Come on now. What a flop! Found it in a Christmas cracker? That's not funny. It worked last night, I played it for hours. Do you believe me? Yes, of course. The song goes like this... wait. Yes. Wait... Lovers on the page live on a cloud floating carefree and gay like young lovers today lovers in print sweet-talking aloud exchange hearts and vows on paper and ink lovers in print don't make fashion hews he wears his collar so tight like a bashful boy scout she's more of a libertine as she gives us a clue her pretty breasts tint the cheeks a red hue of her timid young lover It was my dress, the wedding dress. Madame victoire, head-dressmaker, was on the case. A pleasant journey, madame victoire? Ghastly, thanks. Ludovic drove like a lunatic, I was terrified for my dress. Can I help you? Yes, let me! Leave it alone! Hands off! We worked our fingers to the bone! How beautiful... What do you think? Doesn't it seem to fly away! A dream, a marvel! She'll be stunning in it. White goes so well with her skin. Ludovic, keep the boxes together. Don't scatter the accessories. Thank you. I'll put the dress in your room myself. No one touches it. Here are the rings. I must give them to you directly. Perfect. May I give them to you? Come with me, sir. Are you hungry, ma'am? I do feel a bit peckish. Hungry, dany? - She's always hungry. - Come along. Don't touch! My hands are clean. I et's see. Spotless! And very pretty. - Are you coquettish? - A bit. So you like Lacy petticoats and frills? Very much. Petticoats appeal to you too! Seen my dress, patrice? It's bad luck for the groom to see it before. We're in no danger of that. You seem strange, patrice. What are you thinking about? You really want to know? Sure, as I'm asking. Well... here goes. Too bad for you. And for me. This wedding we're acting out tomorrow... Has been on my mind for ages, seriously. - But... - No, be quiet. It's hard enough as it is. You see, Catherine, I love you. I want to marry you. You can talk now. You're so nice, patrice. You're the nicest guy I ever met... But no. Forgive me. Forget it, I never said it. I'm an idiot. Do you mind? I'm carrying her off. Bedtime. It will be a tough day tomorrow. - Goodnight, patrice. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Looking for something, aunt Yvonne? Nothing, dearest. Already awake? Why sleep naked when you have a pretty nightie? When you sleep alone, it's silly to make extra work. You're a funny child. Aren't you a tiny bit moved? No, it's just a game. It's still a marriage. I so hope you'll be happy. I am! And to prove it, I'm starving. I'll get your breakfast. - I thought of you all night. - Liar. I was wide awake, waiting for you. - That's not true. - I swear it. I came by at midnight, you were asleep. No! But if I'd known... I didn't come. So you were sleeping! 'Morning. 'Morning. Rise and shine! Here's miss Catherine's tray. Thank you, sandrine. - 'Morning, miss. - 'Morning, sir. Hello. - Isn't patrice here? - No, why? I knocked, he didn't answer. It's 9 am, he better get ready. Indeed! I'll go. When you have a minute we'll take some pics. Not here. In the garden. Patrice, wake up! When you said you loved me it was only a game only a game when you said you loved me it was only a game it wasn't true may I, miss? A tough break: Patrice has vanished. What? Didn't he say anything? No, but he looked awful yesterday. See if his motorbike is in the garage. You come with me. We've got to find him! I'm busy. Brought your cassock? As usual. See the padre in the village. Right. Is the wedding breakfast here? I hope so. 40 covers, salmon in herb sauce... I can't think about salmon now. - To do it to me! - Come, sandrine. For Catherine's wedding? A foreign cook! Not foreign, he's from Bordeaux. Like I said, he's not from here! Come and lend us a hand. - Well? - Nothing. 9.30. It's in 2 hours time. What a damn mess. No photos in this issue. The bastard doesn't care. Judith will go berserk. What do we do? Warn chouchou? You all look gloomy! With good reason. Patrice has vanished. - Impossible. - He didn't sleep here. - His bike's gone. - His suitcase too. What's behind it all? - He said something to you? - No. There must be a reason. He's always conscientious. Tell me the truth. What truth? Did you two have a row? No. It's unforgivable. I'll tell him straight. He wants to play tragedy? Right! Don't get so worked up. Ok, stand up for him! So what shall we do? Find a husband. Replace patrice? There's no time. They need the photos tonight for the layout. You replace patrice. Me? Yes! You're the same size. Swell. Terrific. There's rocket science going on in there. Brilliant idea. Lunacy. A brainwave. You'll be magnificent. Absolutely. I don't want to play the clown. - Play the clown? - Yep. Modeling is playing the clown. Thanks a lot. No, chouchou, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. Do you think I could make a suitable husband? You're not risking anything. Well, Mr. Michel, what do we do? Ok. I'll marry chouchou. Not for real, of course. May I be your niece's husband? I'm sorry, Mr. Michel, I don't like banter. Do I marry you or not? Marry me, Michel. You can do it for Judith. Don't talk about Judith. It's for the magazine, not for Judith. - Same thing. - Bravo. You make yourself pretty. C'mon, I'll disguise you as a happy man. 800,000 copies. I'll play the clown for 800,000 copies. How handsome! Like a real fashion photo. Back off. Chouchou, are you ready? You're awe-inspiring, Catherine. The bride appears to the groom. Don't laugh. Why not? I'm happy. Isn't a bride happy? Yes, but they don't laugh. We mustn't laugh when we're happy? Absolutely not. You really don't want to accompany us? We'd be out of place, sir. We're waiting for Catherine to get married properly. I hope she'll accept me that day, as a witness. What are you doing? The same as you, waiting. And the wedding? No! I'm through with it. What do you mean? It's at 11 am. You're hiding something. - You had a row with chouchou. - No, ma'am. Have you done the shoot or not? Well, let's say... I'll explain, ma'am. No. You're mixing love and work. Lucky I'm in a good mood. We're going to fontaine. Marriage first, love later. Come on. Follow me. I'm going. Hello, padre. May I introduce myself? Jules croche, walk-on actor. I'm replacing you. Yes, I know. I'll come with you. She looks like an angel! How beautiful she is. - No more than you. - Flatterer. Not at all. You'd be dazzling in her dress. Oh no. You're very elegant, Catherine. How do you like her dress? I find it a bit flashy. And mine, padre? Highly suitable. I'll find you a good place. Here. You'll be fine here. Let's get cracking. Tony. Padre, would you tell Mr. croche what he has to do? Eave it to me. I know your job. I've played 16 priests in 3 years. My goodness. Ok. The padre on the left. On the right. No, not you. You! The fake. The real one. Like that. Ready. Photo! Thank you. Don't move, I want a close up. Cheer up, you're not at a funeral! I'm sorry, padre. Thank you. You don't approve of this, padre, do you? My child, I don't mind it as my poor parishioners will benefit. No, to be honest, I'd rather marry you for real. Don't move. Not bad. I'll take another one. There. Michel, hold her hand. Photo. Thank you. Some dresses are really magical. As cinderella knows. Luckily I wasn't getting married for real. It was overpowering enough like that. Long live the newlyweds! I felt happy. So happy! I felt I was floating in my white dress. Then Judith arrived. Darling, at last! - At last what? - Yalu zangbu. - What? - Yalu zangbu. - No. - Yes. - Are you sure? - Certain! Read it. From yalu zangbu. Jerome signed it. He's giving me my freedom. Darling, I can marry you! Suddenly I turned into lead. Everything started spinning round. I closed my eyes... Then black out. What happened to me? What happened? What happened to me? She spoke. How do you feel, dearest? Go away! I don't want to see you! Go away, all of you! What's wrong? You should know better than us. She's crying. It's alright. She's relaxing, doctor. We'll see, ma'am. Cry, my child. Cry. Tears are good. May I be alone with the patient? I'm staying. I know her so well. You see, doctor... Please, ma'am, let me be the judge of that. Very well. Come along. It's crazy. That girl is as strong as a horse. You can make her do anything. With that result. Why are you wearing tails? - I married chouchou. - What? I replaced the groom who loved her too much to marry her. Indeed. Calm down, madam. You can't call me "madam". It's only a pretend wedding. For fun. Fun? It doesn't look it. You seem heartbroken. Don't be fooled, doctor. We've bothered you for nothing. That's my job, my child. I've never been sick in my life. Congratulations. But even good health needs care. Excuse me. Have you had a brutal shock recently? A shock? An overpowering emotion, a deep fear. I can't remember. Some sorrow? Is your life going well? Very well, doctor. Everything is fine. Isn't it obvious? Is she still crying? Crying her eyes out. I'm sorry. That doctor is taking ages. She only fainted. 3 drops of mint... Maybe he doesn't read love of life. What's wrong with her exactly? Overwork. She needs a lot of peace and rest. I'll write out a prescription. - She's asking for you. - For me? Mr. patrice must be you. No, doctor, that's not me. Appearances are deceptive. It's me. Why did you leave? - You know very well. - Yes. You know, patrice, about what you said last night... I've been thinking. I can give you an answer now. It's yes. You don't need me, chouchou? No, we don't need you. I understand, kids. Patrice, you haven't said anything. Aren't you pleased? - No. - Why not? I've been thinking a lot too. That's why I left this morning. But as I agree now... Because Judith said she'll marry Michel. C'mon, chouchou. Don't lie to your best friend. Look at me. Weren't you happy Michel was playing your husband? Yes. Own up, you've always loved him. You think so? And he loves you, it's obvious. No, he doesn't. Why shouldn't he love you? He's Judith's lover. A man always has a woman in his life. Whether he loves her or not, it's irrelevant. Bravo. I see you're better. Excuse me. For a man who doesn't love you that's a funny reaction. That'll teach him. No sentimentality in love. Make him suffer right away. Do you love him or not? But there's Judith. You don't fall in love with a magazine. But you marry it. Stand up for yourself, you hear? Talk to Michel. What will I tell him? I don't know. Say you love him and you could die of love. Die of love? You think so? What matters is that he does. I'l send him in. Sit down, Michel. You look moody. The place of honor will be empty. Never mind, I'll sit here. A lot of brides for you in one day, poor baby! It's time for a little speech. Aren't they're bored enough? We must thank them. Eave it to me. Dear friends, speaking for love of life... She wants to see you. B no, I know chouchou. - Carry on. - But... Dear friends, I have one word to say: Thanks. I have something to tell you. I love you, Michel. Why didn't I tell you sooner? I don't know. All I know is I love you. I love you. I love you. Poor sweet, I'm sorry. Why didn't you say you were tired? When you're sensitive you must take care. Come on, open your heart to me. It can't be very serious. What happened with patrice? Was he mean to you? I advise millions of readers, you can trust me. You disappoint me. Sometimes I wonder if you exist. I wonder why we exist. You're funny. Feeling better? Ready to finish the photos? Some intimate shots of the bridal chamber. But I don't want to kill you for it. There's no question of that. I'll finish your photo shoot. Thank you, chouchou. You're saving one of love of life's best issues. I look a frump. No. Fix yourself up. Look. You've never been lovelijer. Will you really marry Michel? Of course. As jérdbme agrees. And Michel, does he agree too? Of course. What I want, god wills. As a rule. Since you have everyone on your side... Do you love him? 2 years ago I was mad about him. Now I'm reasonable. And Michel? He's always been reasonable. So I adapted. Feelings can be controlled. No. Love is different. I don't have time to think of love. I hardly have time to make it! - Even with others... - That's the game. When you're a woman you'll understand. Or when you do, you'll be a woman. Let's see. You look stunning. A bit more Rouge, you're still pale. While victoire dresses you, I'll prepare the bridal chamber. Put it there. We need more flowers on the round table. - Are the blinds closed? - Yes. I think something's missing on the right. That's it. I need a spotlight here. That's right. Marc, lose that chair. Got it. The picture too? Of course. Children, I'm rather pleased with my moonlight effect. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm bored. That makes marriage attractive. This marriage is idiotic. Idiotic? Yes, although it's your idea. After all you told me! What did I tell you? That you love me. 100 times. I mean chouchou's marriage. I meant our marriage, stupid! You had me scared. Come on. 12 photos isn't such a big deal. Your props, Mr. Michel. Give them to patrice, he'll finish the shoot. Chouchou can't marry one man and sleep with another! It wouldn't be proper. Everything ready? All we need is the victim. Bravo, chouchou, very good. Hurry up, she's tired. Alright, chouchou? Ready, Michel? Do you mind, ladies? Marc. I'm sorry. So what do you want? - Don't you have any ideas? - No. Hold her hands, for a start. Smile, children, smile. No, a moved smile, a bit dreamy. Think: Alone at last. Almost alone. Patrice, we're working here. Smile, for god's sake! Smile! No! You're completely wooden. No, Michel! May I show him? Step back and watch me. No, facing us, you'll see better. You see? Easy as pie! Good enough. Ready... Right. Now to the nitty-gritty: The bridal bed! Madame victoire, undress her. Judith. - Is it really necessary? - What? The striptease number. It's cheap. Cut it. And our male readers? Men don't buy us. They read us on the quiet. And the big boss adores undies. Let's go? Hold it. Raise your skirt, show your legs. A bit higher. We're working for Paris by night. You're married, anything goes, hold the position. Photo. Yep! In the bed now. In the bed? On the bed. Lay her on the bed. Rest your head on the pillow. Michel, bend over her. Your arm around his neck. Smile lovingly. Closer, Michel. No, closer. There. Hold it. Don't move an inch. Love is beautiful! Upset at seeing chouchou in Michel's arms? Aren't you upset seeing Michel in chouchou's arms? Please explain. You look like you've understood. I don't like insinuations. Speak up. I said it. What did you say? What exactly did you say? - I said: "Love is beautiful”. - So? Nothing. So beautiful that I quit. I'm dumping you, ma'am. Sorry, darling, no one ever dumps me. I'm kicking you out. As you wish. You can't do this, patrice! I love you so much... Bravo! That's new! How about that! - Don't yell. - I'm not yelling. Yes, you are. I wonder why. Who asked you? Chouchou doesn't love you! Ladies and gentlemen, take a bow. Chouchou wakes up. He's leaving, that beloved man. But maybe love can hold him back. Poor idiot. You've gone too far. Take that back. No way. Are you blind? I see a bastard who I'm going to hit. Why won't you see that chouchou... There. Happy? - Call the doctor back. - No, don't bother. What's going on? Chouchou has fainted again. It's my fault, I drove her too hard. Don't apologize, my dear, work is work. Please let us look after Catherine now. Are you in pain? Yes. - Listen, Michel... - Yes? I love you. You must believe me, I love you. Sure you do. You love me, patrice, everyone. No! I only love you. - Don't you believe me? - Yes, I do. - No! - Please don't get worked up. A fit of nerves, I'll leave her to you. Poor child, what is it now? I'm in love. Perfect. With Michel, naturally. How do you know? I never said. You didn't need to, it's blatant. Who is it? It's chouchou. Come in. What do you want? To talk to you. Well? Well... I came to say I love you. It's true. You must believe me, Michel. I love you. I love you. Did you think that up on your own? No, patrice told me. But he's right. He also said you've loved me for ages. What a smart guy. If I loved you, I'd have told you. - No. - Why not? Because I scare you. - You do? - Patrice is convinced. You bore me with your patrice. I feel he's the one declaring his love. So you love me? Yes. Why do you only tell me now? I only realized it today, because of that stupid wedding. I laughed all the time, I was happy. It was beautiful. Go ahead, jeer at me. If you marry Judith, I'll leave you. Anyway, I'll never see you again. Never again? No. I'll go off and be a model far away. Listen, chouchou. Come here. I haven't given Judith my answer yet. I'd like to say no but I'll say yes. Why? Lots of reasons. Now Jerome is keeping his word, I can't break mine. You don't love her. We have so much in common. It replaces love. But we have so much in common too. And we'll have more. You don't understand. Say it anyway. I feel I'm understanding so much today. With Judith, I know where I'm going. With you, never. Yet I tried everything. So you loved me a tiny bit before? Perhaps. But it's too late now. Too late? Yes. I kissed your cheek once too often. That kills desire. If you'd been a bit different... Different? Yes, like the others, a bit more... I don't know. A bit less... You mean if I was a swinger, if I'd been around, you'd have liked me as much as all your other girls? No, I didn't mean that. Yes, you do! You keep saying if I was this or that, if I wasn't so... If some things don't happen at the right time, they never happen. Now go to bed. It will make more sense tomorrow. Tomorrow will be too late. From now on, things are going to change. I have to forget Michel. I'm sensible enough to let myself go wild. What matters is not losing my head. Apart from that, I have nothing to save. Let's get to work. Lipstick, the bride's gorgeous negligee, the entire array of seduction. What do you expect? I can't act otherwise. I must know what it's all about. What do you think? You're right, today was nothing but a farce, I'll finish it the same way. I'll have my wedding night. Shut the door, quick. What's got into you? I can't sleep. Well, I can. I want to ask you a favor, a big favor. If I can do it, sure. If you want to, you can. For a man it's child's play. Isn't it a bit late for games? On the contrary, it's a game often played at night. Is this a riddle? Listen, patrice, you've always had fine thoughts and fine words for me, today I'm asking you for a fine gesture. Take me, patrice. Take me. You're completely mad. - Please, patrice. - Are you drunk? You can do it for me. Go to bed, and fast. Not alone. It won't cost you, you might even enjoy it. I'm sick of being respected. It must stop. Who gave you this idea? Michel. And you come to me? Like I'm a Saint Bernard? You're not at all helpful. Helpful? Get out. Leave me alone! And if you must, get disrespected elsewhere! Who is it? Chouchou. Open up, quick. I can't, the photos are developing in the stop bath. What do you want? To ask you a favor. Yes? What? Why, sure! Just a second... I mean, a minute... Wait, I'm your man, right away. Sure! Only too happy to! Too happy. Only too happy. Hurry up. Denis! I'm coming. What the... Yes, chouchou, hang on. I'm trying to turn it. Goddammit! Rotten piece of junk! Yes, my chouchou. - Hear that? - It's nothing. - It's sandrine. - Sandrine? Keep calm. Hide, for god's sake. Oh, darn! Over there. No, here. - It's you? - Yes, I need you. Can't it wait? It's urgent. Close the door. Sure, I'd love to. But tonight... Yes, tonight. That's just it... Are you sick? Yes, I'm sick. And I have a headache! I have a fever. There! - What? - A mouse! - I can't see anything. - Near the closet. There! A mouse? Where? It's gone. I'll do likewise. Excuse me. No, I'm going. - There's no reason to... - You stay. You were here first. Yes, I was... Now I feel in the way. Juliette! Goodnight. Look after yourself. Is that you, honey? Come look at this. What are you doing? On great occasions, I like to use my pen. It won't do? But it's the correct formula. You prefer something else? For instance: "Our director, Judith aurigault, "has the honor of informing you that she renounces "her idea of marrying Michel bellanger." Something like that. It's more original, obviously. A bit too much so, isn't it? What's got into you? A romance? You want an extension? Much more, Judith. My freedom. Just when I regain my own. But, Michel, this divorce, my divorce, you wanted it most, no? I know. But you didn't know you'd fall in love with that prude. Judith, be reasonable. Sure, it's so much simpler. How could we be happy? Think about it. I know we've never been difficult with each other, but what's left for us? Nothing. Sure, memories. But they aren't so clean. They are as you made them, and you might add another one. Go on a trip with chouchou, then come back. I'll wait for you. As usual. With whom? No, Judith, not this time. This one, I love. My poor Michel. You love them all. With you, I feel like the Republic: The ministers pass, I remain. Go on. Love her. Like the others. - Hello, Michel. - Good morning. - Did you sleep well? - Yes, thanks. No. I mean no, I slept very badly. I didn't sleep at all. But I made a decision. A decision I must share with you both, although the place, time and outfit are particularly ill-chosen. I have the honor, the joy and fear, especially the fear, of asking for your niece's hand. There! Bravo, Michel! I didn't expect this before next week. I was sure you wouldn't hold out. So you knew I loved Catherine? Before I knew it myself? Way before. But have you told Catherine? - Told her what? - You want to marry her. No. Heavens, no. Girls like to know these things in advance! Then I'll do it. Right now. Come in. You... Chouchou, your aunts just made a monumental blunder. I asked for your hand, and they said yes. Yes. Now don't cry. I don't want to see you crying, even from joy. I love you, Catherine. I've loved you from the first day I saw you. I think I loved you before I even saw you. I know you loved me, but I didn't know that you knew, too. - Is that why you're crying? - Yes. Excuse me, I should have knocked. If you have an old cradle in the house get it ready. It's urgent. It's all working out. I had two flats. I nearly missed you. You're beautiful, my chouchou. I hope you'll be as happy as I'd have liked to be. You're lucky. - My best wishes. - Thank you. I bring you the wedding gift from love of life: Your honeymoon! A dream, children! The lakes, Rome, Naples, Capri... Judith! Don't thank me, it's normal. Take the car, more room for the four of you. - The four of us? - You two, Tony and Marc. Tony and Marc? Of course. All the readers want a follow-up to the marriage. Tony will photograph your honeymoon hour by hour. That's a very good idea. I need the photos within 18 days. Sure. Okay. Michell chouchou! Stop!
