It's all perfectly simple really you just apply for naturalization, obtain the certificate, surrender the old passport, get the surrender certificate and then apply for a British one. Obtain the British passport, apply for the OCI, there's a little exam, and then get hold of the OCI. Two years, tops, should all be sorted. Of course by then who knows who we'll be letting in? Might not even be worth it. Sorry, sorry I don't quite get what you're saying. Can you just repeat everything you just said again please? You are not a British citizen. I mean we couldn't even find a birth certificate for you. And to be frank there are easier obtaining a passport. Mum, Mum could you please tell me what the bloody hell is going on here?
