If it wasn't for your old man, T.J. coming up front for me I never would have made it. Where is he? There. T.J.! And keep your legs apart. Keep your legs apart. I tell her that all the time.

I've had enough, I can't stand any more of this. Thank you very much for agreeing to host us this evening. You're more than welcome. I'm glad I could be of help. Excuse me. Excuse me. How are you? How are you, Claire? I'm fine. You know Neil Steinhart don't you? How is it Claire always managed to get hooked up with the richest men this side of Saudi? This place gives new meaning to the word night-life. What? This place gives new... Come on let's get out of this low brow rag trade and take a hike. You don't mind do you? Well certainly not. I'll be back. So what's with Steinhart? Is this serious? Why? Don't you like him? Well he seems a bit constipated to me babe. I prefer to call it solid, Win. It's nice to have somebody you can count on. You're in good form. I'm sorry, Mr Venza, I've been instructed not to let you in tonight. Are you still writing the occasional magazine article? Occasionally. Well then follow me. The art's in the basement and you are getting a privileged peek. Claire, how are you? Good to see you. The elevator's down there. Just push the button when you're ready okay? Where did Claire go? I think she found someone a lot more interesting. I'm just kidding come on, you're great. You're in overtime, Freddie. Hey Charlie over here. Hey! You need money you come to me. Who the fuck do you think you are? Raising cash without coming to me? Your ex-partner. I'm buying you out Joey. Read the contract. There's ample provision. Fuck the contract! It's over, pal. Take a hike. Nothing's over Winnie, we ain't through yet. You're making an 80% return, which is what you wanted. How the fuck do you know what I want? Fine... Goodbye, it's been fun. Don't turn your back on me when I'm talking to you, Winnie. Grease and water still don't mix, do they, Joey? Grease and water don't mix? Jesus Christ! Grease and water. What are you doing? Winnie. Hello? Hello? T.J. What time is it? Oh no, you gotta be kidding. Okay, I'll be in in 20 minutes. I gotta go to the city. Get off. Hey, Mike. Out of the bag, into the bureau. How do you like it so far? God, have I got a hangover. You ever hear the chatter? They're worse than fucking four-year-olds. Miller, look let's clear a path for them alright? Okay let's find out what we know. Herd 'em up and check 'em out. Anybody knows more than gossip about the deceased or Venza I wanna talk to 'em personally. Keegan, take the witness downtown and babysit her. Just sit there and look impressive. I want her to feel protected. If you can get her boyfriend off my back I'll promote you to deputy commissioner. Halt, halt! All you beautiful people shut the fuck up before I start getting real ugly. Go! Well, is Garber here? No, sir. Look I want to see Lieutenant Garber now. Well he's still uptown but he's on his way. That's what you said half an hour ago. Look it's three in the morning, don't you think you've made her wait here long enough? I'm sorry. She's exhausted, I want to take her home. I'm sorry I understand sir but Lieutenant Garber has to question her. I know that... It's okay, Neil. Look, can I use one of these phones? Yeah, yeah, why don't you use the one in the office, that way you can have some privacy. Right in there. Hey, you all right? I never saw anybody killed before. Yeah. I've never been a detective before. Well I want her safe and secure on this one. Both of you guys are off the charts until she IDs Venza. Venza's either going to skip or get to her. And I don't picture him leaving town. So I want her ass covered 24 hours a day, but I don't want her to know that there's any real danger. God damnit. Tommy! Get down here and get these god-damn skateboards off the floor! What are we having? Scrambled eggs surprise. Scrambled egg surprise? Hi. So, how was it? Not great. I caught a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide. How long? Till they pick up the perp. Looks good. Hey, El, seniority gets the day tour. You know what that means. Lonely nights Michael, I'll live with it 'cause I've lived with it all my life. When my dad was a cop he used to say, El, never go out with a cop. So what do I do? I get a job with the cops, I marry a cop and I've probably given birth to a cop. Tommy, leave it and just come on over here and eat. It's getting cold. Maybe you and Tommy should stay with my ma. What? Your mother? No way! Don't start, all right? It's just the neighborhood has turned into shi... It's a cesspool, and I think it'd be a good idea if you two were not here alone at night. Hey, I can still use the gun. Okay, just keep it some place safe but handy. Oh yeah I know. Keep what safe and handy? Nothing! The gun? It's in the upstairs closet. How do you know where the gun is? I know where everything is. Yeah, except for the god-damn skateboards which are everywhere. Lay back Mack, lay back. Lay back Mack? Lay back mack. Where does he get this stuff? I don't know. Do me a favor, keep the weekends free. Get a replacement for Saturday night so we can have the weekend. Pickles? Hey, hey, lay back, Mack! Look, right there, on the right. Thanks. I want to make one thing absolutely clear and that is that everyone respect the privacy of Miss Gregory's household. So you'll be limited to three areas. The outer vestibules, so you can watch the elevators. The kitchen, so you can get something to eat, and the washroom. So you can take a shit. If Miss Gregory doesn't feel free to walk around her own apartment without running into somebody she might be very upset. I understand. We do need to take a look around the entire layout. Oh, Christ, not Koontz. Be happy. He's good at this. This really isn't necessary. The security in this building is about the best in the city. I'm sure you're right Miss Gregory but I'd consider it a favor if you'd let us have a look around. Be my guest. Thank you. Did you get all that? Any questions? Yeah, what about when she wants to go out? Discourage it. But if she does, stay with her. And call it in first, so we can put a car on tail. Now she's agreed to go out only with her own chauffeur and limousine. Alright? Check it out. Honey, why am I reminded of the Three Stooges. You a vegetarian? Miss Gregory is a vegetarian, so I'm putting food for you people in a separate fridge. You know how to use a microwave? You know how to use a toaster and don't touch the dishwasher. Fuckin' A. Psst, Mike. Excuse me. This is my dressing room and those are my clothes. Now I understand your responsibilities, but I would appreciate it if you stay out of here at all times. Sorry, Miss Gregory. I was just checking around. Excuse me. Excuse me. Other way. Hard to find the doors in this place. Lieutenant... Detective. I um... I hope you understand how upsetting this is. Yes, Ma'am, I do. I'm just saying you should think twice about it. I don't want to talk about it. Neil you know and I know that the only thing standing between Venza getting a life sentence and his freedom is my testimony at his trial. Come on Claire the police have all kinds of methods. For God's sake he murdered Win! He enjoyed it! Win made his choices. And I'm making mine. Honey listen this Venza character is not just a street killer. He's a psychopath. And he's well-connected. He's going to get out in 10 years, in five years. In 90 days. You're gonna be looking over your shoulder the rest of your life. What am I supposed to do? I saw one of my oldest friends get killed. And I saw who did it. And I can't just let that go away. I like 'em toasty. Good night, Mr Keegan. You're here till what time? I'm relieved at four a.m. Would you do me a favor please? I have to go out of town for a few days. Let's do everything we can to make sure this is all less of a trial for her, shall we? Asshole. Go ahead, try it again now. All right! Okay cut. Hey, Ellie! Cut! What the hell are you doing with my car? Adjusting the carburetor. I saw it on... All right. Tommy, get out of the car. I saw it on TV. What do you think? I think television can be a dangerous thing. Hey, 20 bucks in the bank. Yo Tommy, get the hell out of there! Jesus. I read this article... You didn't tell me she was so beautiful. Actually she's better looking than that. Oh, yeah? Yeah, hey I gotta go. I'll see ya Tommy, come here. What do you think? Okay? Unbelievably handsome in a suit. You look great. Nice clothes, Dad. I think so, too. Boston one, New York one. Rangers have the puck they cross the blue line, slap shot And the New York fans... Hi. I'm sorry, I'm not sure how this works. I have to go out to a reception a few blocks away. Well, I don't think that'd be such a great idea. Well Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger. Is that true? Right, that's true. Can we go then? I'd have to call it in. There's a phone in the car. Claire. Hi. Do you have another tie? Something a little more conservative? Yeah, I don't have it with me, it's at home. Okay she's ready. Go ahead, hop in. What? Jesus Christ, what a fucking lunatic! Shopping? I don't see that we have much choice. But tell her, I said she's a fucking lunatic. What did he say? Oh, he thinks you're being a little careless. And he made the point several times. You live in Manhattan? Queens. You know Queens? My father founded a music school there. The Milton Gregory. I'm supposed to speak at their 25th anniversary. Ah nice, maybe you could stop by my place, have an aperitif. Maybe not. Mister you cannot park here! We won't be here a minute right. Miss Gregory. Miss Gregory. Hi there. Would you pick one out? Beg your pardon? Well if you're going to be my escort, you need a new tie. Perfect. Alright, I'll take it. I, I can... No, no, my account. Yes Miss Gregory. If we had more time I'd work on the suit, too. You look rather elegant actually. My wife likes this suit. Here we are. Jesus Christ, Keegan! I'm on duty. What kind of duty? Gigolo? Claire. Follow me. Claire. Oh, Toni. I wouldn't have missed it. This is Michael Keegan, the policeman they've assigned to protect me. Antonia Bolt. How do you do? Hello. Hello. Marge Winwood. Hello. He has such nice eyes, very gentle. Oh, look, he's blushing. I like that. Oh come on. So I hear that you're a policeman. Yeah, I'm a policeman. Ever shot anyone? Yeah. Doesn't it make you hard? Hard? Erect, you know. I heard that it gives you a boner to shoot a man. But you know I think it's good if a man's work gives him a boner, when I get a good stock tip I... Excuse me. Excuse me. Everyone thinks I'm stepping out on Neil. We're causing quite a scandal. These people are a bunch of screaming squirrels. Let's get a drink. Well I tell ya, I'd like to, but I don't think I should. I'm on duty. Well I'd like a spritzer. And couldn't you order something soft for yourself? I've got to go for a pee. I'll come with you. I think I can do that by myself. How can I help you? A spritzer. And a vodka martini. You got it. Make that a double. Okay. Oh. You know what I think? I think you're just some schmuck who uses this policeman line as a come-on. Yeah? Yeah. You're probably right. Don't move! You're gonna see me in a police line-up and say it wasn't me. If you don't do that someone will come after you. They're gonna find you dead with your face missing. Understood? Understood? Good. Christ, you are one beautiful woman. Now you walk out of here. And if you ever see me again, you never saw me before. Sir. It's me. That son of a bitch. Venza! Whoa, whoa. My name's Joey Venza. I'm turning myself in. Venza! What's that? I said I'm Joey Venza, I'm turning myself in! Hi. The real estate lady left. She couldn't wait. What took you? Ah, some shit. What shit, honey? You don't want to hear about it. Did you see the fireplace? It works. 97 five, what do you think? Hey come on, be happy you got him. I don't know that Ellie. He might get out. Garber is not being straight with the witness. I mean she could be in deep shit if she identifies him. She's got to identify him. Why? Well that's how we stop crime is we identify the criminal. I can't believe that you're talking like this, Mister Detective. It proves to me that this girl's got a lot of guts. I think she's crazy. I would identify him. Yeah? Well, I might stop you. I can see you're in a wonderful mood. We'll look at the house another time. No, no I'm sorry. What 97 five, right? Where did you get the tie? What did you say the down payment was here? Look, she didn't like my tie. So, she picked out another one. She took you shopping for a tie? I had to follow her to a store. What's the matter with your paisley tie? Ellie it was a formal party. Come on! Oh, excuse me, Mikey! You went to a party together? Yeah! Yeah! I'm her bodyguard, goddammit! I know you're her bodyguard, goddammit! Did she buy the tie or did you? She bought it. Why? I don't know why! Because she's a generous person and she's a nice person and I could be setting her up to be killed. You want the fucking tie? No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. Looks good on you that tie. Yeah. Listen next time you two go shopping, could you pick us up a stackable double decker washer-drier from Maytag the portable kind? Ellie. Come on, let's see the bedroom. Alright. Come on. Hi. Just checking to see if you were here. Yeah, I came on at eight. You all right? Yeah. I'm sorry about what happened. Listen, that was my fault. No, no, no, I shouldn't have listened to you. I should have followed you right in the can, like Venza. Well if I'd known I was going to have company... Lieutenant Garber says when I identify him, they're gonna lock him up and throw away the key. I'm supposed to do that in the morning. Identify him. The sooner the better. Mike, he said he would kill me. Big talk, desperate guy, you know. Right. I mean how's he gonna do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key? It's the right thing to do, identify him. Okay. Claire, you wouldn't happen to know what languages they speak in India would ya? Hindi, Urdu... Urdu, yeah. Hey, what a woman. Didn't do very well, did you? Nope, never finished one of these things yet. I hate these things. So, tonight's your last night huh? Yeah. You wanna go for a drink? I mean, we're just sitting here and Venza is in jail. Cocktails, huh? Yeah, I'd like that. Listen, where you go, I follow. I'll be right back. I mean some of these people set themselves up as victims simply by body language. You mean to tell me a mugger would stay away from someone simply because they walked a certain way? Absolutely! No, no, no watch this. That is the stupidest walk I have ever seen. Yeah maybe. But seriously, there have been studies about this. You walk like that the muggers are not going to single you out. No but they're gonna die laughing because you're walking so stupidly. Hey this is my business. I don't tell you your business. Right. Let's see if the muggers get me. Now, let's have those cocktails... It was like the first time I met her I knew. I mean she looked so damn adorable in that cop's uniform, putting on a tough act. So, it was love at first sight? Yeah, it was. And is? Yeah. That's nice. And you live in Queens with a child and a dog? No, no dog. Really? I definitely see you with a dog. No dog. But nice? Yeah, very nice. Tell me, what's with this Neil? You don't like him, do you? What's to like? Mike, tell me what you really think! You asked. Well, in his own way Neil is actually very caring. You really haven't seen him at his best. I'll say. Mike! You could do better. I am going to miss you. It's been nice having you watch over me. Yeah. It's been nice being around you too Claire. Let's go home. Good night, Mike. Yeah. You sleep good. Claire... it's three o'clock in the morning. Where the hell have you been? Hey, Mike. Tough night, huh? No, no, Chech it happens that way. Chick gives you a ride in her limousine, next thing you know she's wearing your clothes, having a good time, I heard he had her underpants on his head. Yo, yo, Mike, ease up! Ain't nobody gonna tell the old lady. I think he's mad. Come on what's this the first time the taxpayers paid for a blow job? Hey let's go, get it together. Whoa guys it's showtime. Keegan. You have fun last night? Sir? I heard about it. Watch your step. You take her in and I'll take care of him. Good morning, Miss Gregory. Lieutenant. Thank you for coming. You all ready? Mmhmm. How long is this going to take? It won't take long at all. Right this way, Miss Gregory. Mr Sternhart... Stein. Steinhart. Can I buy you a cup of coffee? Everybody straight ahead. Straight line, please, straight line. Come on, guys. You're wasting your time. No lawyer, no line-up. No lawyer no line-up I'll tell you what, your objection is noted. Now just take a three. I like you with number three, here you go. Take a number, pick a card. It's just like a game show. Have fun. You've seen this on TV before. It's a two-way mirror, they can't see you. Just pick the number of the suspect, okay? Okay. Ah, ah, ah, ah, give me that. You save those for the game. Come here. It's freezing outside. Ah, Ellie! Hey, no! Please don't answer... Hold on. Hello? Yeah, it's the whip. Lieutenant Garber, how are you? What? Oh, no. Yeah. Ellie, Venza's out. No, no, no, wait a minute. I didn't read him his rights because he'd already turned himself in to the patrolman. Are you kidding me? Yeah, yeah, I'll be right in. You'll what? We're not gonna go to the game, we're not gonna go to the game. Venza must have gotten to the patrolman because he claims nobody was pursuing Venza and Venza's attorney danced all over the DA about an irregular arrest. Michael take it easy. Take it easy? I set her up. I saw it coming, Ellie. It's not your fault. Michael get off this case. It is my fault, she's my responsibility. Did you hear what I just said? Did you hear what I said? You hear what I said? I'm going in. Shit. Oh man, am I glad to see you! Michael she is really upset tonight. I ain't going in there. I had to piss in a bottle. Sorry, I ain't got no extras. Hey, Mikey, have a nice night. Claire? Claire? Claire, it's just me. I want to talk to you. Now, let me in! You've put my life in danger. No, you're gonna be safe. We are gonna pick him up again. And then what? I'll never be safe. I'm gonna have to leave the country. The truth is that you can't protect me and you can't keep him in jail. And God you knew that all the god-damn time. What are you do... You tell me I'm safe? I'm going for a walk in the park. Hey calm down will ya? I'm perfectly calm! I'm a normal human being, I'm going for a walk in the park. Now just stop it! Let go of me! Would you stop being so nuts! I trusted you! I thought you cared about me! I do care about you. Bullshit! More bullshit! Will you let go! I'm not going to leave you alone through this. Hey... I'm not going to let anything happen to you. Okay? There's somebody outside. I know somebody's outside. Christ, you stupid kid. Great dogs. They were used as army dogs in World War One. Great with kids. They're very loyal, very protective. Get a Rottweiler. Don't get a Rottweiler, he likes rottweilers. Can you imagine picking up the... Hey, Mike. Everything's okay. No really, just relax, calm down, everything's fine. Ellie reported a prowler, that's all. Probably one of them peepers that's making this neighborhood such a pleasure. Well, we all look like hell. Thanks for the coffee. I'm gonna come round in a car from time to time. So, get some sleep. And keep the shades pulled. So, thanks for the coffee. You guys have been terrific. I'm sorry, I know I heard something. Detective's wife. You and Tommy are staying with my mother. Oh don't be ridiculous. That's all I need is rubbing up against your mother and grandmother. I can take care of myself. We need some sleep. We all need some sleep. God, I'm glad you're home! What's it to be? Oh I don't know, Ellie. Oh Baby, don't make an issue out of it, okay? You want the fucking meatloaf or not? Do you have to say fucking every other word? What was that? You heard me! Mikey somebody's feeding you a line of crap. What are you talking about? I've been talking like this for 16 years Michael and all of a sudden, out of the blue, you find it vulgar?

All messed up, T.J. You gotta change tours, Michael. We can't take this. I'm sorry, Ellie. I'm not saying it's your fault. Hey, what did you do tonight? I watched TV. Oh, what did you watch? You don't have to have small conversation with me. Michael I'm gonna make a reservation in that really nice restaurant. The one in Brooklyn? Yeah. We can have an early dinner. You don't have to get up until 12. Yeah. One teacher says he's an angel and another teacher says he's a monster. I think he's an angelic monster, our son. Yeah, that about sums him up. He misses you.

Well, I mean I spoke to his wife and his wife spoke to him. Wait a minute, what am I hearing here? You talked to his wife? My wife talks to his wife about which tour I'm going to work? What is this, Ellie? What's the difference what tour you work on Michael? Yeah okay. Unless there's some particular reason that you feel better to be around her at night? Is there, Michael? Well, what is this? Is it serious? Quit looking at me like that. What's with this ridiculous silence? God damn you. You son of a bitch. You don't understand... What are you gonna give me a confession? I don't understand? You get off this case or you don't come home. And I want you to remember that I behaved like a lady. The kind of lady you apparently prefer. Ellie! Ellie! Get away from me, Michael. Oh God. Here let me drive you. No! If she means so much to you then you stay with her, Michael. But you come back, you come back for me. Not for Tommy, not for your mother, not for your god-damn job. You come back for me, okay? I'm sorry, El. I love you. I do.

Take it easy. Hi. Hi, T.J. Detective Keegan, Mike, Michael asked me to tell you he's under the weather. He'll probably take the day tour. But he's okay? Yeah, he's got a bad gut. You know what I mean? Thank you. Mmhmm. Tell me I'm dreamin'. T.J. knows about us, so does Ellie. You told her? No, not exactly. What do you want to do? I don't know. You're tired. Let me watch over you tonight. ♪ Smoke gets in your eyes ♪ It's three o'clock in the morning, and to all you night-owls and music-lovers, I wish you sweet dreams. Now let's take a look at the forecast for tonight here in the Metropolitan area. We're expecting the possibility of showers... Oh motherfucker. Don't even think about it. T.J.! Oh God. Come on, T.J., live! Please live! Come on, T.J.! Come on! Anything you want to deny, Mike? No. As of now you're on suspension, pending disciplinary hearings. And you're not to go near that woman again until she's no longer under police protection and the case is closed. Is it love, Mike? I hope so. I want it to be worth it for your sake. How is he? He's in surgery right now. Will you take me to him? I will, I will. It's gonna be a little while. You come back. I'll be right here. Come back. I'm going to go to my sister's for a while. I want you to get your things out. What about Tommy? He'll live through it. They all live through it. What a world. Was it Venza? Did you get him? What a shame. What's he gonna do? Move in here? And then do shift work at the 21st if they'll have him back? Sugar you'd better start thinking this through because this is the rest of your life we're talking about. I have thought this through, Neil. I'm really sorry. Well if anything changes, you'll let me know, okay? This place used to be my splash pad, well until I got divorced, now it's home. That's the can. It's nice, huh? Yeah. This, le boudoir. Little Scotty stays on Wednesdays and every other weekend. You know something, Mike? Our relationship's never been better. That's good. Yeah. Bunk-beds, huh? Yeah, well you know kids. This, the den of iniquity. Mike, the world is yours. I mean who wants to be a cop now anyway? Tell me that. And what the hell is so great about being married? Wait till you see a couple of the parties that go on in this place. You're gonna realize marriage is an ideal whose time has come and gone. Michael, in three weeks, I'm gonna remind you how bad you felt and you're not gonna believe me. Gotta go. Here, make it home, Mike. Thanks, Scotty. Sure. We're gonna have to work something out about the bedroom. Well, Yvonne, she's a screamer. Yeah. Yeah, I moved into Scotty's. Listen, good news about T.J., though. Looks like that tough son of a gun's gonna pull through. Oh God, that's great. Yeah. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. When can I see you? There's an event at my father's school. An anniversary. Mike I was thinking maybe you could come? Oh, the thing in Queens. Yeah. I'm going away after that. The next day. Can you come? Claire that wouldn't be very smart, you know? Listen, you're right, don't do it. I'll just, uh... I'll send you an address, okay? Ah, Claire... Mike I gotta go, I'm expecting some calls. I'll be fine, really. I'll think about Wednesday. Okay. Bye. See ya. How's it goin', pal? Okay, I guess. Good. Listen, how about dinner tonight? She's taking singing lessons. She's what? She met some friend of aunt Millie's who works at a record company. Says she has a great voice. What? That's the most pathetic line I ever heard of. Who is this guy? You coming in? No, I'm not coming in. If you'd rather go to singing lessons than have dinner with your old man, well I don't know. We're not going to singing lessons. She's gonna take singing lessons. Oh, excuse me. So, what are you doing tonight? Shooting. Shooting? Mom says, we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood. Tommy! She can't sing. I don't think she can sing, either! I thought you were supposed to aim at the heart. Would you like to dance? Oh, no, thank you. Oh, man! Do you believe this fucking idiot? Get serious, man. Come on don't do it. You're out of line, man. What a memory. Yeah, cops, you know? Do you dance? Do you? Pretty badly. Let's do it. The guys treating you all right? Yeah. I've been doing a lot of thinking. I know. It wouldn't work out, Claire. I know. You see, I'd miss my life too much. Don't explain. How long you going away for? Long enough. For? To forget about you. Come on man hurry up. Brooklyn's patching a call through to you. He thought he'd find you here. He says it sounds urgent. Why? Mikey it's your son. No, no the office, down the hall, up the stairs. He's crying. Hello? Tommy? Who is this? Joey Venza. You alone? Yeah. I'm glad you're where I expected you to be, Detective Keegan 'cause you got two minutes to get home or I take your family out. Just don't touch them. Let me talk to my son. - Speak! - Dad? - Michael! - Shut up! Tommy? He's got my family. Call a cruiser. She's going home. Venza wants you. You for Ellie and Tommy. All right, let's go. We're taking her home. Come on move it, get the car. Mike you've gotta go right now. Koontz, Koontz, come on I need you guys! I can't do it man. You know that. He's not gonna allow it anyway man. He's not going to let anyone walk out of that house alive who can finger him. Give me the keys! Come on give me the keys! Come on Mike what the hell man. Give me the keys man come on. Go, get out of here! They're assigned to me, they'll have to come if I go with you. I'm not getting out, now go! Go! Get out of the car. Come on man let's go.

I'm coming in alone like you asked me. You gotta listen to me, Joey or you're not going to get out of this situation. Tommy, no! You should have brought the girl! I brought the girl, she's outside. Hold it! I'll prove it to you, okay? Just relax, Joey. Relax, okay? Far enough. Claire! Mike! That's it, not another word. How do I know that's her? She's not coming in unless you let them go. You gotta let them go Joey. Why should she come in? Because she trusts me, Joey. She trust me and she'll do what I say. Bullshit! Claire, come on in. All right, give me your coat and scarf. We're down here at the end of the hall. Stop, that's far enough. Let them go Joey or she ain't coming in. I get my hostage first. No one gets turned loose until I say so. You let my kid go. I'm letting no one go. You take the gun off my kid and you put it on me or she ain't coming in. Don't you fucking give me no orders! We're gonna do it Joey Let him go! Put the kid on the floor! Stay under there! Turn around. Get down. Now bring her in. Claire, come on in. Lie down. You shut up. Tell me something Joey, what ya gonna do? Shut up huh? You gonna go to Canada? Mexico?
