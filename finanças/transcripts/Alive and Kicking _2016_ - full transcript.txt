[swing music plays] [light bulb buzzing] [music playing] The first time I saw Lindy Hop, I was 18 years old, I was a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, and it was to Duke Ellington's "Rockin' in Rhythm." And it was four couples onstage, and they were throwing aerials, and it was so incredible and playful and fun and magical, and I saw this, and I was like... [squeals] "I have to do that. I have to do that." MAN: I'm a swing dancer, 'cause I fell in love with it. Most importantly, it's the music that keeps me coming back, so I'll always dance. Lindy Hop is so free. It's so fun. You know? And anything goes. It's so hard to explain to nondancers this obsession. They--I don't think they really get it. To dance with another person and to find the connection, it is like-- like having sex when you are on amphetamine or something. [laughs] Swing dancing is the pursuit of happiness. [swing music playing] [instrumental playing] WOMAN: I think the way that our society is built right now, a lot of people, they're so isolated, They really, really live lives of quiet desperation. They get up in the morning, they go to work, they come home, they sit home by themselves and watch TV, maybe they go to the mall, go to bed, get up the next day, and the same thing repeats, repeats. We're just becoming more isolated. I like to think that I'm the last generation that grew up outside. We'd go outside and ride our bikes. There was interaction. You went to school. You had recess. You played games. You know, now it's video games, it's isolation, and it's hard for people to relate. I don't think people have the skills at personal interaction anymore. The world is becoming kind of a spectator sport. It used to be you'd go to a concert, and everyone was singing along and getting into the moment. Now you go to a concert, and people are like this... with their phones. It's all about Facebook, texting, I.M.ing, e-mails, cell phones. I mean, people prefer to text over even talk to each other. And thank God for dancing. Thank God for Lindy Hop, because that is the balance to this. I am a dancer. I've been dancing for 29-- 28 years of my life. It's like a purpose and a calling. [laughs] I remember the first time that I got paid to dance, and I was like, "Really?" And I was just blown away by the fact that it was possible to get paid for doing something you loved. [cheering] [swing music playing] [cheering] ANNOUNCER: Let's give it up for Michael and Evita! I'm not doing it for the contest. I'm not doing it to win. I'm doing it just to dance. Well, first by yourself, everybody with your right foot, go... 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. As a full-time professional dancer, I make the majority of my money from teaching. You don't win a lot of money from competitions. It is not at all like the ballroom circuit. 5, 6, 5, 6, 7-- And 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 2, 4, 5, 7, up! 2, 3. MAN: This is not big-money business at all. The people who do this full-time, they barely scrape by with a living. If they wanted big money, they would, like, work, you know, sort of making coffee. EVITA: The better money is made when I go internationally. There, I'm considered a novelty. I'm considered a special guest from New York City, and so I get a larger amount of money in one weekend from my work. You develop this family of dancers that's on the circuit, and they become like really good friends, and you look forward to seeing them. If you take it seriously and you realize that these aren't paid vacations. I'm being flown somewhere and paid to create this experience for the students, for the audience. And if I can't do that, they'll get somebody else. [dog barks] So I work for a 24-hour emergency service construction company, so I have to crawl under houses a lot, go into attics, run into spiders and rats and sewage, poo water, all the fun stuff. It's an interesting job, you know? Every day is a little bit different. I'm on call pretty much all the time, so I dance when I can, and sometimes I'm at a dance, and I have to leave. Me and Chanzie, my dance partner, we try and get together when we can, but she works, too. My full name is Chandrae Roettig. That's been a disaster my whole life. [swing music playing] Steve's a blast to work with, and we're always laughing. Give a quote. [as Jerry Lewis] Has she got everything?! [as Brando] I coulda been a contenda. I coulda been somebody. [as Christopher Walken] Your son, fuck-head that he is, left his I.D. in a dead man's hands. [normal] That's all I got. [music resumes] Steve and I are not a couple, and it's kind of nice, 'cause the other aspect never gets in the way. STEVE: I always wanted to move to L.A. because of dancing. They called it Hollywood style. You know, it's just a lot smoother of a dance, uh, cool, everyone dressed up vintage. And then I saw the Camp Hollywood tapes, and I was like, "That's where I want to be." Camp Hollywood is a huge event. How myself and so many other people learned was watching the competition videos, and now to, you know, be competing in it... Yes, we are nervous. Yeah. Uhh. Most people don't even realize that swing dancing competitions aren't choreographed. It's all improvised. You can practice with your partner long before competition, but when you get there, you have no idea what music they're going to play, you don't know how fast it's going to be, and you have no idea when you're gonna get called out either. If you do something badass in a contest, all of the other Lindy Hoppers in the world are watching that on YouTube, and if they liked that stuff you did, they're gonna bring you to their city, and then you're gonna get hired for a teaching gig, and that's how Lindy Hop instructors sort of make their living. CHANZIE: We're a new partnership, so-- Been together for, like, half a year. Of course we want to represent real well, you know. Hopefully this will help us to teach. We want to try-- try to go somewhere with it. [swing music playing] So the history, kind of, of this swing bubble that we live in. Here's the swing bubble, Oh, Jo's got it. Swing bubble. Got the swing bubble. Inside the swing bubble, we've got Lindy Hop, we've got East Coast Swing, West Coast Swing, Collegiate Shog-- Shag! Carolina Shag, Balboa, St. Louis Shag... D.C. Hand Dancing... D.C. Hand Dancing. We've got Cajun Zydeco Dancing. We've got Boogie-Woogie. We've got Rock n Roll. We've got Bugg, Swedish Bugg, and we got Double Bug, and it just goes on and on from there. They're all in part of- encased in the swing jazz era genre of dancing. MAN: Lindy Hop is the original American swing dance, and from this dance, we've had so many branches come off of this amazing, beautiful, wonderful tree. And even a lot of the moves that you see in hip-hop and other dances today are coming from this exact same spot. When you Lindy Hopping, you're swinging, honey. I mean, you swinging, baby. [laughs] [swing music playing] KEVIN: The swing-out is the Holy Grail of Lindy Hop. It's the one move that you can never do enough. You have this syncopation and this stretch and this pull in of energy, and it whips around and slingshots your partner away from you. She goes out so fast, you're thinking she's never gonna stop, but there's this lifeline of the leader holding on, and brings the follow right back into their arms and continues and does it again. Every dance has its own mood, and so I think that tango is very dramatic, and West Coast Swing can be sultry, and Salsa is sexy, but Lindy Hop is silly. It's ridiculous. Have you seen these kinds of moves in, like, ballroom? In ballroom dancing, you have rules. Your hand must be here. Your head must be here. You can't pass rules on swing. EVITA: There is no clean, perfect, technical position a lot of times in Lindy Hop, and so you have the freedom to go for it, to just, like, throw your arms up, you know? Like, kick your foot! I mean, it's-- It's freeing, you know? And there's actually less mistakes that are even possible, because there is no mistake. [swing music playing] Ready? Yeah. [man laughs] Yeah, so that's the-- That's the-- That's the first aerial that was ever created. Swing dancing is a traditional man-woman-couple thing, and very few women dare to do this... Yeah. I think, without the man. [swing music playing] For me, it's also political. It's important to be able to do things as partners. Even though you're not lovers. Because it has happened a lot for men throughout history, you know, famous male show business couples. Women need to be so much better as a couple. Competitive dancers don't see us as a threat until we are actually, like, there. ANNOUNCER: Our first song-- I think it's nice to play, like, harmless. That's a Swedish thing, to be more underdogs. That's really Swedish. [swing music playing] Swing dancing started in the late 1920s and early '30s, when our country was in the depths of the worst depression it had ever known. EVITA: People were so fallen. They just lost everything, and the music and the dance and the movement, its purpose was to elevate people, to raise their spirits, to let them laugh and smile for-- even for a moment. [swing music playing] It was the one relief you had from the bad times. They would work hard and save-- save their pennies, save their dimes so that they could go out once or twice a week and go dancing. ANDREA: This dance was born with the black community. It started out as a street dance in Harlem. African-Americans danced on sidewalks and roads, and eventually they brought it into the ballroom. It's our music. Louis Armstrong gave us the sound... Basie gave us the beat, and Duke Ellington told you it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing. How can you listen to that music and not pat your foot? EVITA: It was that essence of the dance, that striving for happiness, striving for joy amongst all odds that inspired the world. Lindy Hop was featured in a lot of ballrooms in Harlem, but the Savoy Ballroom was the first to allow black people and white people to dance together socially. You're talking about a time when Harlem is white people's playground. You had the Cotton Club up the street. White people went in. Black people was the dancers. They couldn't go through the front door. And here was a ballroom in the center of Harlem, and when those doors opened, you got white people, but here came the black people going through the same door. No other club in Harlem did that. The first generation of Lindy Hoppers got their start there, but then it got perfected and really went to Hollywood through Norma Miller and Frankie Manning's group, the Whitey's Lindy Hoppers. NORMA: There was a knock on my door. It was Whitey. And he said, "I would like for you "to come and dance with us, 'cause I'd rather you dance with us than against us." Frankie Manning has a reach so far and wide in Lindy Hop that you can't Lindy Hop and not know about him. RUSTY: Frankie was one of the main choreographers for this group, and he came up with the first aerial. I just danced. Swing dancing was the hot thing, and then it was nonexistent pretty much, for decades. The reason the swing dancing died was that people stopped going. The soldiers came home. Everybody just wanted to start families, and they stopped going out. I left the Lindy Hop, period. I left the Savoy. You could-- There were no jobs! Frankie went to the post office to make a living, and he really felt people should be responsible and make a living, felt very strongly about it. I just went in there with the idea that I was only gonna be there a short period of time. They knew that I had been in show business, but I didn't expound on that. I didn't say, "Well, yeah, I did this. I did that." And so there's this long period of total irrelevance. [laughs] You know, we're talking, like, 30, 40 years. No. [swing music playing] [smooth jazz playing] I run Camp Hollywood and the National Jitterbug Championships, which is kind of like a long weekend convention for swing dancers, and I've done that since 1998. It took off, and I don't think at the time I intended it to be a yearly event, but it quickly became clear that it should be. 1, 2 1, 2, 3, 4 [cheering] We'll tell people, "Oh, we're going to this dance weekend," and people will say, "Did you win?" And then they'll say, "Well, what else do you do at these dance weekends?" Classes during the daytime, some performances of the teachers, a dance at night, and they're just a great opportunity to be exposed to a wider range of people to dance with. Basically, like, we get 1,800 of our closest friends into a hotel room. We all dance with each other for the weekend, and a couple people win a couple of, you know, ribbons or trophies or something like that, but most of it is just socializing on the dance floor. The stakes in competition have to do for your soul. If you can kill it on the dance floor, your soul will remain for eternity. If you lose on the dance floor, you've lost in life and are considered a failure. [ding] And now it's time to bring out our finalists, so welcome now Steven and Chandrae! [cheering] [no audible dialogue] Well, after we went out our second time through, I was like, "We just won it." Yeah. He turned to me and said that... Yeah, "We just won." And I was like, "Nuh-uh!" One of the judges looked at me when we got in the line, and she was just like... [no audible dialogue] We got a lot of great compliments from friends and heroes and some that we really respect. It was amazing. Yeah. [both laugh] We decided to quit our jobs here pretty soon and just pursue dancing for-- Full time with each other and just try to teach weekly classes to stay afloat. And then hopefully the more that we compete, the more that we get ourselves out there, then the more business will come back. Zoe, come here. Yeah! I actually started swing dancing... after my first tour in Iraq. I joined the Marine Corps in 2001. When I came back, I felt like I couldn't relate to people in my own country anymore, and I felt alienated and isolated. I just thought about, like, all the guys that didn't make it back. Like, I came back, and I just wanted to kill myself. And the dancing was a huge outlet for me. To see people doing all the crazy footwork and the aerials, doing the splits. They were dancing to this old-time music and dressed up in vintage clothes. That just blew me away, and I thought to myself, "If it takes me the rest of my life, I am going to learn how to do that," and it gave me a reason to live. One of the most amazing experiences I've had was Camp Hollywood this last year. We ended up switching partners, and then I got Mo, one of my favorite dancers in the world. And I remember standing there right next to Mo with the band starting to play, thinking, "Wow, this is why I made it, for moments like this." Everybody's-- Everybody's gone through their dark times. Everyone's always been in a position where they're really finding a reason to go on, and for me, for me at that moment, it was--it was the dance. It was Lindy Hop. RUSTY: In 1983, four places discovered Lindy Hop in a big way. So you got Los Angeles, New York, London, and Sweden. That's when the movie studios started issuing out their old movies on VHS tape. People got ahold of the movies, and they could watch them over and over and over again. And then they said, "Well, who are these people?" I was getting ready to retire, and I-- I had gotten this phone call from Erin Stevens. [laughing] She came on the phone and said, "Well, are you Frankie Manning, the dancer?" And I said, "No, I'm Frankie Manning, the postal worker." [laughs] I always say a lot of other teachers taught me steps, but Frankie Manning taught me the heart and the soul of the dance. The Swedes asked who would come. They asked me first, but when I saw them dance, I couldn't deal with it. I said, "No way." But see, Frankie did, and-- See, Frankie's kind. So I decided to go to New York again, meet Frankie, and then Frankie came to Sweden in '87. NORMA: I love dancers. I just hate beginners. Learn everything. Then when you come in and I tell you, "All right, give me eight bars," at least you know what I'm talking about. Beep bop-di-bop, bop-bop, mm-bop I wouldn't teach a crippled crab how to use a crutch. [both laugh] So the swing dance scene was already growing, and then suddenly there was the perfect trifecta. In the mid-'90s, you had the movie "Swing Kids"... Yeah. [swing music playing] "Swingers"... and then the Gap commercial... Then you wail, you gotta jump, jive, and Then you wail, you gotta jump, jive, and ...and that just blew swing dancing sky-high. Swing dance camps started kind of springing up around the globe. And then dancers at those camps would say, "Hey, let's hire Frankie and bring him to our community." I asked him, "Frankie, how many weekends "do you travel away from New York teaching somewhere else?" And he said, "I think this year, I do 42 weekends." This was a man, at the time, 85 years old. I like meeting different people from different countries, and a lot of times, they don't understand me, I don't understand them as far as speaking is concerned, but they can understand when my feet move. They say, "Oh, that? Yeah, I can do that." You know, "I could..." The minute he starts dancing, everyone gets it. Suddenly it's like the magic pill, you know? "Oh, I see I've been doing it wrong all this time," you know? Now you have swing dancing in places that it never would have been before, in Scandinavia, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia. As a matter of fact, right now, one of the biggest Lindy Hop communities in the world is South Korea. It's not a Lindy Hop competition unless you get your ass kicked by a Korean. [laughs] 'Cause I would like to see everybody in the world Lindy Hoppin'. I started swing dancing the year after I finished high school. Emelie didn't have a dance partner, so she convinced me to start dancing. I was totally skeptical at first. I was like, "No--" I had to force her. Yeah. I was like, "I can't even do aerobics." We both tried to have normal jobs as psychologists. You wake up in the morning, and you're happy, and you go to work, and during the day, you talk to people who tell you that life sucks and life is not worth living for eight hours, and then after eight hours, you--you kind of believe it, too. So the--the last client, then you're like, "Yeah, you're right." Psychotherapy was the worst way to make people happy, and to teach Lindy Hop and to dance with people is a way better way to make people happy and to make the world a better place. [speaking Swedish] [rock-'n'-roll playing] We thought that we would be able to combine the two works to work, like, 200%. Yeah. Uh, but that was impossible. We said yes to go and teach, uh, in a lot of places, and then we canceled, and that's a very... Bad thing to do dumb thing to do, because then they won't ask you again. If you're away from the scene for, like, half a year or a year... Like, they forget about you. Arch your back. No. REBECKA: So we've been coming on tourist visas. It's kind of hard to get through the customs, 'cause they, like, wonder how we can go on vacation, like, all the time. Yeah. Uh, so we have to, like, make up these stories, you know? SUSAN: What are some of the stories you've made up? That we are really rich. Yeah. [laughs] Really rich parents. Do you have other siblings? Yeah. We're actually not biological, uh, sisters. [record needle scratches] That's a long story. [both laugh] We met each other very, very long time ago. We became very close friends, and then we decided to become sisters, to adopt each other. And are you a couple? Or are you just best friends? No, we're sisters. We're sisters. We adopted each other. And you changed your name legally? Yeah. Yeah. It's in our passports. Whose name did you take? We took a new name. We made it up. You made it up? Yes. We are the only in the whole world with that name. My guy is at home, and I'm away for 1 1/2 month. Um... He must be the last. Okay, the hierarchy. Uh, okay, I hope he never sees this. [laughs] But-- Ohh. I would always-- I mean, I would always choose dancing and-- and our partnership, I think, before him, yes. [swing music playing] Here's a little Benny Goodman for all you cats out there. It's called "All the Cats Join In." Nobody does social dancing better than Lindy Hop. There's a leader, and there's a follower. The leader always has to be thinking ahead, planning what they're gonna do next, how they're gonna move the partner. The follower is responding to what the guy's doing and have this great conversation. It's a little hard to learn. It's like a lot of good things in life. Maybe you maybe have to put in a little work to get to a place where you get tremendous reward. DORRY: When you are social dancing swing, there's no choreography. You are dancing to the music that the band is creating. AUGIE: You have to improvise. You have to negotiate, kind of like jazz music, this ability to call and respond, to read your partner and see what happens. ANDREA: You're sharing your imagination with someone else, and that's real intimacy. And that moment can never be recreated. That's what makes it special. Unlike some dances I've observed that are partner dances, but they're very much, "I'm on a date with my girlfriend. Don't ask her to dance," Lindy Hop, it's understood that everyone dances with everybody, and the more, the merrier. I mean, I think really, if there were a movie called "Lindy Hop," the tagline should be "The more, the merrier." When I came back from your dance on Saturday and I--You know, I got home at, like, 2:00 in the morning, and my wife was in bed, and she woke up, and the first thing she said to me was, "Did you dance with everybody?" And I said, "Yes, I did." [laughs] Wow. ANDREA: There's an incredible intimacy that forms amongst strangers. You meet someone for the first time, and by the end of the song, you feel like they're finishing you sentences. If I had that kind of connection with someone I met in a grocery store, I'd ask him for his number, but it's not like that. In a swing dance, you just move on and find the next person. Frankie always called it, like, three-minute romance. You're just gonna be in love with this person you're dancing with for three minutes, and it's gonna be amazing, and then you do it again and again all night long. It's an addiction that's better, more fulfilling, and healthier than crack, but probably about as addictive. They dance nonstop. They all pretty much just move in the ballroom, sleeping bags and everything. We dance and we sleep anywhere. I've slept in chairs like this, too, where you don't even have somewhere to lay down. You just kind of, like, sit, and... MARY: They steam up my windows and dance for hours. We don't sell cigarettes. We don't sell booze. We don't sell sneakers. We sell nothing but happiness. When my husband first proposed to me, I told him I was already married to the Lindy Hop. It's everything to me. It's pure joy set to music. [civil defense sirens blaring] [music playing] In 2005, the city was filled with a lot of death, but filled with a lot of defiance and life at the same time. New Orleans became the hotspot for Lindy Hop after Hurricane Katrina. Lots of professional instructors, musicians migrated to try to bring that art back to the streets and sort of save jazz's life. [playing jazz] Swing music came out of the music that came out of New Orleans, came out of traditional jazz. When I was coming here, I was a bit afraid, because I started building up in my head how fantastic it will be, and, you know, I was a bit afraid that I would be disappointed. Then when I came here, there were bands everywhere, and there was dancing in the street. ANDREA: I feel like New Orleans is the only place in the world where you can walk down the street and find Lindy Hop. SING: Last night, the bars were so crowded, so we walk out, and it's okay, 'cause there's a band there. We could dance here. Then la-la-la-la-la-la. Then you walk further down. It was another band there. What about here? It was really like Disneyland for dancers. [vocalizing] MESCHIYA: Well, music has healed people in New Orleans since the dawn of its existence. Now, if you get tired and weak Let mama grind a while for you We celebrate life every chance we get. Yeah [cheering] [band playing blues] Well, blues dancing was of course a very intimate dance that was supposed to be done with your sweetheart. Historically was more about the sort of thing you did late at night at a house party when you'd been drinking, you know, in a private juke joint or something like that. This was never a ballroom dance. It's funny. I mean, I-- Again, I don't wanna, you know, insult anybody, but I'm one of those people that thinks blues is kind of icky. [laughs] EVITA: Lots of people are afraid of it because of how intimate it can be. There's a stillness while you're pressed up against somebody else, and I think it forces you to be present in that moment. Uh... blues dancing, I think, um, it-- it walks a fine line. Um, I personally enjoy it. It's become part of something that you learn when you're a swing dancer, and perhaps you perform it. Perhaps you compete in competitions like we do with it. Lots of moments I love in blues dancing where you suspend upwards or you linger longer before taking that step... or you melt into a dip, and you sort of just drip all over each other. You know how they always say "You don't know how you would respond in the moment of whatever." It's really true of-- of dancing sometimes. Every time I close my eyes I seem to seek Louisiana All those folks down there Singing in their free and easy manner... Yeah, she's so much more powerful and controlled and put together than the way I feel. I don't have the perfect shape or frame. It doesn't look like the magazine. It doesn't look like the movie stars. You know, it doesn't look like a ballet dancer. And yet, it is exactly what it's supposed to be. It's really scary to move in a sensual way. It requires a confidence or a permission, and the thing is everybody has it in them. We all are capable of this, but we're just so petrified to--to be that. ...steady homing I'm Delta bound When I teach blues, I just try to spend most of my time talking about the psychology, more so than, "Hey, everybody, do this step." And maybe that's what people need every now and then. They just need permission from somebody else to do what they want to do. Well, when I started in the '90s, it was a lot of, um, ex-punk rockers, but it's mostly now young people, very religious people, and/or Asian engineers. [laughs] It's an odd combo, but somehow it works. There's one group that's missing in numbers. They're there, but they're missing in the numbers in which they should be representive, and that's African-American dancers. This is one of the funniest and strangest oxymorons. The dance started in Harlem. It went all over the world, which is great, but there's somehow a disconnect happened. Sometimes you hear within the black community, "Oh, we create things, and then we move on, we move on, we move on." We went to the place. It was full of black people, and they were doing their thing, and so we went over in the corner and started dancing. There was only about 10 of us, and all the black people come over and say, "Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. What are you all doing?" And I said, "Now, that's pretty funny. "This is your dance, and you come over and ask me what are we doing." When we talk to the children and we ask them, "Where did this dance start?" they say Europe. They say almost anything except Harlem. So I show them the old clips, and they're in black and white. Then I say, "Now I'm gonna show you some people doing it today, "so you're gonna see some color clips, but I want you to tell me what color you don't see." They say, "I don't see brown. I don't see myself." And it's sad. I feel like black people are not given a whole lot of things that are part of their, like, culture or heritage to be proud of, and I think it's hard to grow up that way. It's hard to grow up and have that sense of self. But we are responsible for an art, and that's something that, like, I'm very proud to say is mine. You have got to include-- Drag them in, shake 'em up, but get black kids involved in what you're doing! There are people out there who-- who need this dance, and I think that the younger you get it, the more happy and adjusted you can probably be. ALLISON: Once they see those films, they really want to do it. And they realize they can't do this dance with pants on the ground. They pick up their pants, and they start doing it. [laughs] The music, the dance, the excitement gets them. It's probably in their bloodline. They don't even know it. [laughs] Me and Chanzie, we're going to D.C., week and a half, for the International Lindy Hop Championship. Yeah. Thanks, man. I.L.H.C. is one of the biggest international events in the world. There's an energy there that's a little different. It's because there's so many foreigners. There's people from all over the world, and the best of the best come there. [swing music playing] Little bit. Always. Like, it's-- More just excited, you know. More excited. Excited-nervous, but I think you have to have that. It's-- Once the music starts, it's, uh-- the nerves are gone. From the United States as well, Steven Sayer and Chandrae Roettig. This is way more competition than there was at Camp Hollywood this year. And after that, anything you want. My recommendation is... It's not home. You know, there's something comforting about home, and so-- Don't have the home-field advantage anymore. We're in somebody else's ballpark right now. Yeah. [chanting] Baltimore! Baltimore! Baltimore! These Baltimore kids, man. Shit. [chuckles] 1, 2 Clap your hands. Owww! [cheering] [cheering] We trained so hard. We really did. We trained so hard. I felt like it was just gonna be like Camp Hollywood, like, we're just gonna blow these people out the water. And then we get down there, and it was like, "Oh, my God." It's like everybody's out there, you know, everybody, all the big names. Name 'em, they were out there. Well, Kevin and Jo definitely know how to work the crowd. They--You know, they worked the Baltimore crowd real good. Yeah, we definitely-- we definitely didn't work the crowd. [both laugh] ANNOUNCER: Oh, yeah! Make some noise! We sucked. It would have helped for us to do better. [muted cheers fading] [crickets chirping] EVITA: There's a lot of places all over the world where you can go dancing. It's kinda similar to where people would go to pray. You can pray in your bedroom, and you can pray on the subway, and you could have, like, a religious moment anywhere, but there's some times when you walk into a cathedral. The Avalon Ballroom on Catalina Island is like walking into a cathedral for dancing. [music playing] GEORGE: I remember when I met the caretaker, who's been there since the '30s or the '40s. He was an elderly gentleman, but he said to me, on the way out, he says, "The lady was happy with your show." And I kind of looked at him with a puzzlement, and I said, "Um, lady?" He says, "Yes, the ballroom, the lady. You know, and she's seen them all." [swing music playing] The creases in my hat are deep And my shadow's grown long This California fever Won't leave me alone If I could be more specific I'm on the Southern Pacific Thank you, Doctor I got my ticket in hand It's stamped for the promised land I'm headed out west Out where the living is best I'm headed out west Out where the living is best [laughs] Oh, my God. Yeah. Wow. Thank you. EVITA: We've never danced together. It's--It's like magic, and it's like a small miracle. It's-- Makes you feel a whole lot better than you are, 'cause I know I'm not that good. That's not true. She made me a lot better. [slow jazz playing] Steve and I had to do three dances back to back. And, yeah, that sounds so romantic and dramatic, but it's sincerely what happens all the time in this dance. You'll find someone, and you'll-- you'll just hit it off with them, and it doesn't mean you're gonna marry them, but there is a sincere spark. Steve, a pleasure... Hey, it was... absolute pleasure. It'll be amazing. EVITA: Physical contact and touch has got to be the most powerful gift that we could give to each other. I think people are afraid to physically contact each other, 'cause maybe it's too intimate? And it's really easy to distance ourselves. As I grew up and graduated from high school and college, I went to work, I clocked in, I clocked out, and I didn't really have much of a life other than that. Emotionally, I just was sort of hidden and locked up, um, which is not the way for a person to live. SING: We get caught up with other things. We get caught up with doing well in work or studying hard and all this. You know, you forget about freedom. You forget about being spontaneous. EVITA: I know so many of my friends, and they have regular jobs where they're sitting in an office at their computer, and they have to meet me at Swing 46 on Tuesday night, because that is their physical outlet for being with people, and it's not just standing around at a bar, drinking. It's playing. You have to be on your feet and physically touching somebody else. ANDREA: Every dance feels like sharing a joke or having, like, a little secret conversation, and I think that connectiveness to another person is enough to, like, break the doldrums, you know, make you realize that things are okay. I--I look around, and there's like 200 people, and there's not a cell phone out. It's amazing. So people get a respite from all of the negativity that modern culture puts on us. ANDREA: I needed to hold people's hand, and I needed to, like, hug people, and I needed to, like, share a laugh, and I just wasn't doing that before Lindy Hop. I think that it's made me more willing to get to know people and to open up. It's so nice. I don't think about... the future, bills... Like problems, yeah. money. I just dance. Wouldn't you rather have somebody say, "Dance with me," instead of "Facebook me"? Exactly! I'm poking you! "I'm poking you." [laughs] [swing music playing] [crowd cheering] I think one of the most special things about the Lindy Hop community is how revered the old-timers are, the original dancers. Because in today's society, there's very little opportunity to interact with people of other generations, unless they're family members. Freda has served as an inspiration to many of us dancers for a very, very long time. You have made us feel like a wonderful part of a very big family, so, Freda, we love you! [cheering] [swing music playing] They bring to us the history of what we love. They bring it to us on a personal basis, because they lived it. They were there. [cheering] It really gets me, I mean, here, I mean, really gets me. I know when I started in the mid-'90s, a lot of these people were in their 70s and early 80s. And I was thinking, "Boy, you know, "it's such a privilege that we get to have these people still here, "and they're--You know, in a couple of years, they're all gonna be gone." Well, 15 years later, most of them are still here, which is-- completely blows my mind. There are still people dancing in their 90s. I'll stop dancing when my feet don't move any more. [laughs] And then I might just sit in a chair and try to do that. So wait. This one is called? Tabby the Cat. Tabby the Cat. You'll know. [laughter] One of the things that is so rewarding about this is I can see that this activity heals people's lives. It's not the activity. It's the community combined with the activity. 1, 2, 3. Now, I can also say from a personal aspect that this is so true, because in 2000, I had an accident with my dance partner Peter. We were practicing our aerials to make sure we had our timing right, and suddenly it just went bad, and as I'm diving, I'm supposed to be able to catch his legs, and I realize he's not there. And there's nothing for me to do, there's no time for me put my hands down, so I landed on my head from eight feet straight down, and I heard all this crunching and cracking, and then I couldn't feel my body. I wasn't breathing, I was just lying, you know, like that, 'cause I was paralyzed. I ended up breaking my neck in five different places. I was at death's door, and the swing dance community went like this and lifted me up and held me in their little hands until everything was okay. I had over 500 e-mails printed out, cut out, and my hospital room was wallpapered. Every day, bouquets of flowers, bouquets of flowers. And they sent me a big video message and a phone call. I mean, it was incredible, and that was, uh-- that was healing. You know, we're a family, and we'll do whatever you need. We're here for you. I can't even tell you how many students I've had tell me the following-- "I got off my antidepressants." "I lost a lot of weight and feel so much better." "I got through the most horrendous breakup I've had in my life." "I lost my job and didn't think I was gonna survive, and this got me through it." Those are amazing things to hear. From swing dancing? You know, swing dancing? Swing dancing. [swing music playing] After the rrruhh at I.L.H.C., we had to come back and just kind of revamp ourselves and get excited again. And then we had to go back to I.L.H.C., and wow! Well, definitely last year, we felt like, you know, nobody, small, small fish, big, big, big, big pond. And, uh, this year, we still feel like small fish, but... we feel like really good small fish. Like, I watch our dancing this year, and I like it. We've gotten better together. [cell phone rings] Hello. Whoo! Finals for what? What? [laughs] I knew when we started partnering that this was, like, my chance to get what I want out of dancing, was with Chanzie. [cheering] And the winner in first right here, and they represented... Our goal is to bring the L.A. scene up... Definitely. respected how it used to be. Like it used to be like, "L.A.?" Like, "Ooh, L.A. You're from L.A.? You must be good." You know, like, that's how everyone always thought, you know, if you're from L.A., you're a badass. Line up! Move. Quick, quick, quick, quick, stop. I try to motivate people with the kind of motivation that would motivate me. If it was up to me, I would say, "Chanzie, don't tell them they can take a break. There's no breaks!" Your break is before the song and at the end of the song, all right?! During the song, you go all out the whole fucking time. Sometimes you play bad cop... Sometimes. but not too often. We switch it up. Yeah. But mainly I'm a good cop probably. [laughs] I'm the asshole. [swing music playing] EMELIE: I think we saw Steve and Chanzie for the first time, um, in clips from competitions, and then we saw that they were teaching at the same event as we were in San Diego. [jazz playing] Meeting the DecaVita Sisters down in San Diego, that was awesome. They're so-- They're so lovely. REBECKA: I felt that they were up-and-coming. They had this, uh, glow, like with an optimism and energy that some of the established people don't have anymore. There was obviously a chemistry between Emelie and Steven from the very first time they met. Hey, Emelie. [chuckles] INTERVIEWER: What happened last night? Did you?! Did you?! [laughing] No, we had some drinks. No. Yeah. This is my Swedish girlfriend. Get her face. She's got the good face. I love her. Yeah. [laughs] Come on! It is easy, but, no-- Oh. Oh, you're cheek rubbing. Ahh. Aww. They're both very flirtatious types, so, I mean, I didn't expect anything else. Oh? What? Oh, I mean, that's just how those weekend workshops work, though. You go to a dance event. Sometimes you dance with somebody-- You got good chemistry with. You know, you guys feel each other, feels real good. Everything's very fast, you know. And you have to say good-bye, and--[laughs] You don't know when you're gonna meet again. Meanwhile, you go to a couple other dances. You run into someone you feel real good-- I mean, you just-- Workshops. Weekend events. You meet people you like. Hey, that's-- I'm not a whore. I haven't slept with any of these girls. I'm just saying. You make some connections. Whoo! Whoo! Holy-- [laughs] One of my favorite quotes about Lindy Hop is this, "The biggest cartoon wins." ["Super Mario Bros." theme playing] [swing music playing] [cheering] We're crazy. That's the bottom line. Lindy Hoppers hate rules. I made the decision when I started my competition event that I was gonna leave it as rule-free as possible. We're more interested in someone getting up and making a fool of themselves in a way that allows everyone to participate in that humor. What the heck is Herrang? For five weeks, you can dance around the clock. If I had to equate it with anything, I would say it's like the Burning Man of the swing dance world. REBECKA: There's so many crazy things happening in Herrang every night. Frankie's favorite night, cross-dressing, and he'd walk up in a dress, in a wig, in lipstick, with his son Chazz in a dress and a wig and the lipstick and a handbag, and the two of them would be these two, you know, biddies, like, "Uh-huh. Mm-hmm," you know, coming in. [dance music playing] By day, I'm a kidney transplant surgeon. Every once in a while at events, we would just throw a big party and just buy a bunch of beer. We went kind of crazy for a couple hours. [music playing] Okay. Yeah. Whoa! [cheering] [cheering] It's a very satisfying thing to walk into a place as, like, a little mini celebrity. But the people that I meet all over the world, I don't know when I'll get to see them again. I give them as much as I can in that weekend, but I can't stick around and foster or nurture them. I feel like some people maybe hold on to this traveling lifestyle as a way of not establishing roots, almost running away from the thought of it, and I say that, because I think I do that. My profession and my job is to teach people how to connect, and yet in my personal life, I have a really hard time maintaining that for myself. My life is spent so much on the road, and it's hard to have everyday friends, and it's hard to stay in contact with those you love. Just recently this fall, my--my grandfather passed away, my mom's dad, and I wasn't able to go home to be with the family or even to be at his funeral, 'cause I was in Germany. Being 33, I should think about my retirement account and all these things. You know, "What am I gonna do when I can't dance anymore?" I've never had any other work that would be something to fall back onto. I've worked at coffee shops. I could maintain this for a long time, and I've seen people do it well until their mid-40s. You get to experience so much, probably so much more than other people do, but then you have to ask yourself, what's the priority in life? 'Cause you know we don't last forever, and we definitely can't dance forever. In August, we had bought tickets for Seattle. We were just about to leave. And it was actually during practice that I had felt chest pain. You had thought it was some inflammation, right? Yeah. Like from aerials or something. I did not think it was cancer. Because, yeah, that was like... eh... Yeah. Yeah. It was a-- It was a big tumor, like the size of a large egg. They told me that day that I had to cancel my trip and that I needed to have surgery. When Rebecka called me the first time, I understood right away that it would be, like, a lot of bad things happening from now on and that I would be scared a lot of times, so I guess I kind of decided that I had to take, like, one step at a time. I started taking photos of Rebecka when she was sick, mostly because I needed to do something creative. I also wanted the swing dance community be able to follow her, because suddenly we couldn't travel, and we couldn't be everywhere anymore. And we still felt that support from the swing scene. On that photo, you kind of look a little bit like a warrior. I was a bit reluctant from the beginning, because it was very revealing, me, like, having no hair, no-- and with the surgery and everything. For me, she was so strong, and I wanted to show that to her, we could do something together still. My treatment turned out really long. Uh... It was 300 days. Was it? Yeah. Okay, good. Keep track. Many times, I've been thinking, like, I would never be able to-- to dance more. You kind of have to appreciate what your body does for you so you just don't take things for granted as much. Well, you know, if I didn't have a single material thing of Frankie's, I--I still would never stop thinking of him. [music playing] Frankie passed, and for three days, they celebrated... dancing. LENNART: I feel kind of sad for people coming into the dance today that never will have the opportunity to meet a person with the personality that Frankie Manning had. His wish before he passed was to see it come back in Harlem, and I was just telling him, "Don't worry. It will. It will." From here on out, it's about teaching people what he taught me. When Frankie passed, certainly a big piece of my life was over. I--I would say, "Frankie, what should I do? How should I go on?" You know, I'd say that to the universe, and I'd always hear in my mind the same thing, and it was Frankie's voice saying, "Dance. Dance." I listened, and I started dancing. I just pushed myself out there. It was so uplifting. It was so wonderful. It was such happiness to me and still is to this day. It's the biggest happiness in my life. Frankie always said that there would be no wars if everybody danced, and I know that sounds a little extreme or a little bit grandiose, but I have seen it. It is impossible to hate somebody once you've danced with them. Something that saddens me a bit about American culture is how polarized we seem to have become as a nation and that people are this, that, or the other, and their friends are like-minded this, that, or the other. And what's pretty phenomenal about swing dancing is that you're gonna find everybody there. It's very common, like with Facebook that you see, "Oh, my God, this is their religious belief or their political belief," and you would think, "I would never want to talk to this person. Like, ugh." And yet, your connection with them on the dance floor was beautiful. Any of us could go to pretty much any country in the world and look up the local Lindy Hoppers and not only get advice on where to go dancing, but probably a dinner out with all of the local dancers, somewhere to stay, a lifelong friend, a--a spouse. You know, who knows? Just because you're a fellow Lindy Hopper, you're automatically accepted and welcomed. JOHN: I started to see this--this community as much more than just a bunch of people who get together and dance. We have a really strong bond. That's probably the most amazing thing about it, is you meet somebody that you don't even know, and you dance, and you feel like you've known each other forever. So same thing, you know, this person believes this politics or, you know, believes this about guns or has this sexual preference, and--and you may be completely at odds or in opposition to them, and yet none of that matters. It's all superficial things that we stack onto ourselves, and it's not really who we are in our hearts or our souls, and the dance gets us closer to our hearts and our souls. Got a gal in New Orleans... EMELIE: I'm really happy that we can go, because last year, we couldn't go. There are two couples battling each other. Couple 176! 176! That's Rebecka and Emelie! The judges have to, like, point to a couple they think they're the best. Dancing against couple 174. To win... You have to battle eight times and win all those battles. All right, you guys know what's up. Take your place on the floor. I don't really have any expectation on this competition. [swing music playing] [cheering] Emelie and Rebecka! This past year has been about so much other stuff that has been more important, because it has to do with life and not life. What I think about now is some people are taking this so seriously. It just feels great that we can be in the competition. Here we go. 1, 2, 3. Boom! Chance and Lisa are going on to the finals! Put your hands together for both of these amazing couples. [applause] I'm really proud of us, especially myself, very proud of myself. [laughs] Yay. [both laughing] STEVE: 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, forward, turn! In, out, triple. CHANZIE: One of the things that we're really passionate about is bringing people together. We started three teams at--in September. Rock it. All of them tell us that this is what they look forward to every week. Hit. It's really about making something where anybody can get involved, anybody of any level, any age, um, 'cause that's a community. You know, you don't just have a community of, like, 20-year-olds, community of everybody. We went to Europe for the first time this year. In February. That was really exciting. It was amazing. And Norma Miller had an interview. It was so awesome. It's like, "Stand up!" She made us stand up, and she's like-- She's, like-- made everyone, like, applaud for us, and she was like, "If you ever get the opportunity to take lessons from them, you-- you have to do it." I seriously just got watery eye, like, "I'm not about to cry, man." [laughs] But that was amazing. It just, uh, felt good to hear that from someone, you know, I've worshiped and stuff. That you admire so much. Every moment that I walk back into my own home, every moment that I get to see my hats and my shoes, I'm just like, "It's me again." [laughs] I love New York City, I want to be and live and work in New York City. I'm ready to invest and create something that's bigger than myself, that will last longer than my body. And a lot of that is this dance company that Michael Jagger and I are working on. It involves saying no to work so that I'm not traveling quite as much. It involves learning things I had--I know nothing about, like LLCC double-Q tax stuff, and-- Everybody's afraid of taxes, and ugh. And I love it, because it's a whole 'nother different satisfaction to foster talent in your base and look at that and say, "I made that." Yeah! [cheering] Bravo! We're also doing work with Harlem Swings and the high school kids in Harlem. This is really exciting for the dancers, for me, for the company members, and then also for these kids, and I really think Frankie would be very happy about that. People always ask us, like, if you are okay now, if, like, the cancer is gone, and you can never say it's gone, because you don't know if it's gone, and it can come back. If your safety is threatened, then I think it's a tendency for people to try to build some kind of... Security. Yeah. It's an illusion, but-- because you're never safe. You have to live in the moment and take one day at a time. EVITA: So many people think that happiness is this passive thing where you have to wait until something happens, and then you'll be happy... this idea that it's always a step away, that it's not in our reach. You can go dancing, and you remember that happiness is always within you. GEORGE: But I was very privileged to meet Mr. Count Basie, and I'd just like to share his philosophy that applies to everything in life, and, uh, he says, "Persevere, "persevere, persevere." Three words. Or is it one word, right, three times. [laughs] EVITA: It awakens you, quickens your heart, and you breathe deeper. You laugh. You yell out, and that's being alive. That is being alive. We've been in the presence of Frankie Manning, and he has given us his spirit to heal the world, to make it a new place. God bless you! Dance! Dance! Dance! [cheering] 1, 2 1, 2, 3, 4 [swing music playing] [cheering] [jazz playing] Listen, brothers and sisters Have you met that old mister? When you do, he'll grab you by the toe And he will never let you go Talking 'bout Mr. Rhythm If your woman is cheating Or your man says he's leaving Better get yourself some dancing shoes And syncopate your weary blues Shuffling along with Mr. Rhythm Now Mr. Melody sounds mighty fine to me When he croons a tune of love He sings to me so sweet and knocks me off my feet But Mr. Rhythm picks me back up If you feel like a sad sack Mr. Rhythm has what you lack Better get yourself some jive, Jack Lay back, and let yourself relax Leave everything to Mr. Rhythm
