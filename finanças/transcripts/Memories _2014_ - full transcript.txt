Gentlemen, please. MEMORIES - Are you coming? - I have a job interview. - That's great! - Yes, but I don't think I'll go. Hello, Romain. OK, bye. - Where were you? - Wrong cemetery. - Your father is very affected. - Of course. - Is grandma OK? - I think so. Where the hell were you? I went to the wrong cemetery. How can you go to the wrong cemetery? Your grandpa won't be hurt. He loves you so much, my dear. As much as I do. I'd like to go home. You graduated from J. Decour school? Yes. And now you're studying literature. Have you started that novel yet? What novel? The novel you're supposed to write. - I'm not supposed to... - Yes, you are. You're studying letters, you want to be a night watchman. Yes, but I won't write a novel. You should. Really? Yes? You should. You look like a writer. Do you have depression? Well, no. Because you look depressed, just like a writer. Right, but I'm not... I mean, I'm... Yes? No? I'm just kidding. - Damn! I actually thought that... - Yeah, right. - Listen, I think we're good. - Really? - Can you start on Monday? - No problem. Alright. See you then. - I'm Philippe. - Romain. I know, it's on your CV. Yes, you're right. I'm an idiot. - It's you, my dear. - Hi, Grandma. I have been very busy. I haven't stopped. - With sugar. - Great! Just what I need. I found some things. Look. - Are those photos? - Yes. Let me show you... Oh! Look. This is my sister Jeannette. My brother Louis, with his sailor collar. This is me. I have a ribbon. Look. It's your grandfather. He looks just like dad. Wow! They're identical. This is your father's christening. He was so little. It's weird. Life goes by so fast. I found a job. I'll be a night watchman in a hotel. You'll work by night. That's typical of you. You remind me of your grandpa. - Really? - Yes. He didn't like to do what people expect. Michel Esnart, a counselor specialized in inheritance, Paris-Pigalle agency. Today, he's just Michel. You got the job at 24 years old. You fought your way to the top, and in 40 years of career, not a single tomb. I mean, TOIL. I would like to make a toast to your brilliant career. Today you're retiring. On behalf of the Banque Postale, I would like to offer you this gift as a sign of gratitude. A trip for two to Tunisia, half board. Thank you. I'm going to miss you. Well, not all of you. I'm leaving so many memories here. Alright! It's time for a drink. Want some help, Isabelle? No, I'm good, thank you. It was nice. Yes, it was nice. It's almost full. Do you want to take it? Well, OK. Oh, goodbye. - Well, yes. - Yes. Goodbye. You think I'm sad? I couldn't stand that place anymore. I finally feel free. We're going to have a good time. I bought some tickets. To Tunisia. You bought tickets? Really? Well, yes. You went to a travel agency and you bought tickets? Yes, I did. Your colleagues asked me if you preferred Greece or Tunisia. I said Tunisia. I did the right thing, no? Well, yes. I look like a fool. It's no big deal. - You want some apple juice? - No, thanks. Right... - Karim! - Damn you, idiot! You scared me, bro. - What are you doing? It's 6 AM. - Nothing. There is a new girl across the street. She wakes up early. She must be a nurse or something. Yesterday, she waved at me. I'm waiting for her. You're in a suit? I'm justifying my presence. She'll think I wake up early, too. She'll like that. Chicks love hard workers. They love liars, too? Move, there she is. Damn! What a bitch. Disgusting. I'm going to bed. I woke up at 4 AM for this crap. To hell with that bitch. Damn! Hello? What were you doing? I was sleeping, Dad. I told you, I work at night. What's going on? Your grandma fell down. Shit! Is it serious? No. I don't know. I'm at the hospital. Text me the hospital's address. I'll be right there. She could have broken her leg, and that's... I can imagine, yes. At her age, it gets more and more hard to live alone. - I'll see you later. - Thank you. - Dad. - Oh, you're here. - Want some coffee? - No. How is she? She's OK. She regained consciousness. Luckily, the neighbor saw her through the window. - Can you imagine! - Yes. Damn. - Sure you don't want some coffee? - No, thanks. I don't know what we're going to do. Why? This coffee's really good. You should have one. Alright. I don't think she can live alone anymore. So what are you going to do? Forget about my brothers. I'll be the one who decides. They always find a reason to slip away. They're on their way. I'll talk to them. - There. - Thank you. You want to send her to a home. This coffee's good. That's strange. She won't take it. It can be just for a while. A home is not for a while. Any other option? - The hospital car park... - You always have an excuse. Hi. Right, let's go. Unbelievable. You're always late. - Even in these cases. - Oh, stop it! I'm here already. It's OK. I didn't die. I'll be out in two days and I'll go back home. What's the matter? Mom, we're worried about the future. What future? Your future. Well, exactly. It is my future. Yes, but... It's a little bit complicated. Patrick and I were saying... Right, Patrick? - Patrick! - Oh, I mean... It's Pierre's idea. You'd be safer in a home. What is that nonsense? It's not a home... That's not what we said. It's more like a hotel, you know. Yes. It's just like a hotel. The difference is they will take care of you, too. Hotels don't do that. So it's even better. I want to stay at home. We'll be worried. And it's dangerous. Ladies are robbed. Now you'll scare her! You don't say anything, as usual. Tell her we don't have a choice! Leave me alone. I need to rest. I'm tired. Goodbye, Mom. See you tomorrow. I want to go play with Paul. Please. I want to go to Paul's. Please, Mom. Come on! Why won't you let me go? Come on! Mom, we have to go. Are you coming or not? I'm coming. Turn it off. Why? You always like some music when we're in the car. I mean, it's not a problem for me. By the way, they organize a little concert every month. The conservatory students are in charge of it. I think it's great. Next month, it's Schubert. You love Schubert. That's a coincidence. Are you hot? No. If you're hot, I can open the windows. I'm bundled up. The traffic is light today. Sometimes, it's just very heavy. There's a sort of... I'll call you tonight, when you're settled in. If you're in your room. I'm sure you'll make some friends. Alright. Here it is. Check that out. There's a spot right there. It's a nice place to park. I mean, really. I hate driving in circles for hours. See? It's quite big. There's a park behind. It's lovely. Hello. Bonjour, Mrs. Lesec. This is my mother. - Hello, madam. - Hello. - And my son, Romain. - Hello, young man. Welcome to our house. Your house. First, we'll visit the first floor. I'd like to see my room. Yes, of course. I understand. You may want to rest a little bit. It's one of our best rooms. Your sons wanted you to have a nice view. You will see, it's really... It's like a room in paradise. OK, let's go. Come with me, please. Here's the telephone. Dial zero to talk to the front desk. In this brochure, you'll find all the activities we organize here. We have a film club, where you can see all the French cinema classics again. We love the classics. Gabin, Arletty, Jouvet. They'll live forever in our hearts. We have games: belote and dominos. And we discover the Loire chateaux through painting. Oh well, I could go on. I have to leave now. I'm in a rush. Another person is coming. A future boyfriend or girlfriend, maybe. I'll see you at dinner. It's Andalusian night. So we're going olé, olé. See you later! You actually have a really nice view. Thank you for coming with me. Do you want us to stay? No, I'm OK. I'll put my things away. Are you sure? We'll get some coffee and we'll come back. We need to try the coffee. Right, Romain? - We do! - But Grandma wants to be alone. OK, then... I'll call you later. Have you decided yet? I'm between the shepherd's pie and the Morteau sausage. I mean, the pie looks good. But you never know. They make it with leftovers. - Take the sausage! - It's too saucy. - And you? - A salad. - Are you ready? - Yes. - Not yet. - Yes, we're ready. I'll take a Caesar salad, for him, a shepherd's pie and a Morteau sausage. - But... - No buts. I've been waiting for an hour. You're so indecisive! - Indecisive? - Yes. - Me? - Yes. To drink? - Yes. - I'm not sure yet. - I'll come back. - Oh, no. The house wine will be perfect. Thank you. - What is going on? - You're not doing good. You're always on the couch, nothing interests you. - My mother. - That's not the problem. - It is! - No, it's not. Hi, Nathalie. - Hello, Simon! - All good? - And you? - I'm fine. This is my husband, Michel. - Simon, Michel. - Hello. Hello. Right. I'll leave you. - See you, Nathalie. - Goodbye, Simon. - Who is that? - The Spanish teacher. Surprise! - All right? - Yes. - You're not eating? - No. I'm not hungry. They ruin my appetite. They do menus for old people. - You look good. - Yes. I need to show you something. I look grumpy, but not at all. What do you want to show me? Look. - Look. - Oh, no! Look at that atrocity. It's amazing! Who painted that? - It's unbelievable. - What is it? It's a cow. No, I think it's a horse. I don't know, but I like it. The color contrast is interesting. And the look. It looks sad. OK? Not too much work? No, I'm OK. I'm happy with you. Really? Yes, you're doing a nice job. Thanks. What about your novel? I'm not writing a novel. You should write a historical novel. A story during the war. People like that. You should write something with Nazis. Want some crisps? No, thank you. - It's quiet. - Yes. We'll have a drink. I have a bottle of Chiroubles. It's a cold, red wine. You'll see! - Right now? - Yes. - Hello, Mr. Esnart. - Hello. How is your mother doing? OK, thanks. - She's in a retirement home? - Yes. What about the apartment? Meaning? I'm interested in it. - It's not for sale. - Of course. I would gain some space. I will soon have 4 children. Congrats! - I'll make an offer. - But... I'll give you my card. You can call me to talk about it. Bye! - Hello. - Good evening. The keys for room 12, please. - Here. - Thanks. - Have a nice evening. - Yes. Your birthday is next Saturday. Yes, I'll be turning 62. - Can you imagine? - No. You look like you're 65, 66. Your father called. He will pick me up at noon. - He was mysterious. - He must have planned something. Yes. A platter of seafood at La Mascotte, in Montmartre, as usual. You're right. One, two, three! Surprise! Oh! I didn't expect it at all. Bravo, Mom! Happy birthday to you! Thank you! Thank you! Go ahead! You have to make a wish first. - Oh, I should make a wish? - Yes. - What is your wish? - Patrick! You can't say it. Otherwise, it won't come true. Come on! Bravo! - Alright, who will cut the cake? - You. Of course. The food here is always excellent. - Hi, Romain. - Hi. How are you? I didn't know you were coming. I'm taking you somewhere. Your bag. There you go. What about you? - Patrick will take me. - Really? - Thanks for the lunch. - You're welcome, Mom. I hope you liked it. Come on, let's go. I can't tell her. We'll go to the notary first. She always loses money. When is the appointment? It's the day after tomorrow! Right, take me home. Goodbye to you. - Is it a Thursday? - Yes! - Do you have something to do? - No. Where are we going? I won't tell you, Grandma. It wouldn't be a surprise. You know old people don't like surprises. Hello, sir. Hello. My grandma and I wanted to meet you. We are great fans of yours. Really? That cow is really... You could think it's just a cow. But it's not. You were telling me today how much you like it. I mean, really. It's fascinating. I'm glad you like it. I stopped painting 10 years ago. My ex-wife used to tell me I had no talent I threw everything away when she left. I was a teacher at the Picasso school. What an irony. The students don't care about painting. So I painted for myself. It was my hidden little garden. I'm boring you with my stories. - No, not at all. - No. Wait, I'll be right back. - You shouldn't make fun of him. - I'm not, Grandma. We're making him happy. You might be right. - Oh! - This is for you. - Wow! - No, I can't accept it. Please, do. It's the last painting I have. It's part of my "Animal" period. It's a yak. No, it's a dog. Oh! How are you, Michel? - Good. - Thanks for coming. It's a pleasure. How are you? I'm OK. Lots of work, as usual. - Will you take my package? - Yes. - Excuse me. - I know how it feels. So... Hi. - Michel? - Hey! Hello. - Thanks for passing by. - Of course. Michel, this is Léonard. Nice to meet you. - He's your replacement. - Oh! We have to go. We have a credit simulation to do. - Sure. - Speaking of that... - Bye. - See you soon. Good luck. It's a complicated case. Well, yes. Come in! - Hi there. - Oh, it's you! - I thought you'd be late. - You look beautiful! Thank you. I might have to go to another funeral next week. - Really? - Yes. René's, my aunt's cousin-in-law. He had a pulmonary embolism two days ago. He may not make it to the end of the week. - That's sad. - Yes. Let's go. It will clear our heads. She was a really great dancer, you know. Very famous. She danced like she was flying. It was pure magic. Thank you for coming. Mom liked you very much. It was mutual. Your mother was wonderful. - Come on, let's go. - What? We're off. Don't you want to stay? Stay? What for? She's dead, it's over. Hey, you're too sensitive. I'd like to go home. Home? Well, I mean, my apartment. - Didn't Dad tell you that... - Tell me what? Nothing. Let's go. Where were you? I told you, I was at a funeral. How was it? You had fun? You're asking if I had fun at a funeral? - Are you stupid? - Just chatting. Well, no, it wasn't fun. And my grandma found out her apartment had been sold. - That sucks. - Yes. - How are you? - Fine. This is disgusting. It's cold. It's awful. What? What is it? What's the matter? Stop it. It's annoying. What's the problem? A sparkle in your eyes. You met a chick? At the hotel. Am I right? Let me guess. It's a 40-year-old chick. She's sick of being alone. She's not 45. At all. - I was right. - What? You did meet someone! - No, no. - Yes. OK, maybe. Well, tell me about it! I want to know it all. I want details. Nothing happened. We just met at the funeral. You flirted at a funeral? Damn! That is... I didn't flirt at a funeral. Are you stupid? We just exchanged looks. And... that's it. She was beautiful, and I left. I don't know how to find her. That's pretty sad. Oh, but wait! - She must be a member of the family. - Yes. So she will go and visit the grave. I won't spend my life at the cemetery. You'll leave her a note. It's romantic. Twilight style. Kind of like Robert Pattinson. This Coke is hot. Cold raviolis, hot Coke. I reverse things. Disgusting. For the girl in the green sweater - Philippe. - Yes. - Can I ask you a question? - Yes, of course. I was wondering... Why did you hire me? - You're always here. - Because I like you. And I have a son who is your age. - Oh. You have a son? - Yes. But he lives in Australia with his mother. So we talk on Skype. - Skype is very practical. - Yeah, right. It's a shame. I want to hold him tight. Alright, maybe we should open a bottle of wine. What? Your father is in the living room. It's your grandma. What's wrong? - She's gone. - She died? Don't say that! She disappeared from the home. The manager called. They're in a panic. I'll get dressed. Sorry. Come on. Come on, hurry up! Why didn't you go by yourself? I didn't want to go alone. I just couldn't. What about Mom? We've had some communication problems lately. What do you mean? She won't talk. You could have told me. I could have. But I can't always be the informer. Besides, let me handle one problem at a time. We're talking about your grandmother. Alright? She's gone. Do you understand? At least we know where your mother is. So please, stop! Let's give priority to those we can't find. OK? - Do I amuse you? - No. - Then stop it! - Calm down. I am calm. I'm very calm. There's a spot right there. That's pretty much it. She disappeared. How could she leave like that? Don't you watch them? We're not a prison. Wait... It has happened before. But it's unusual. Something happened to her. No. If that was the case, we'd already know. I called the police station. No accidents or incidents since yesterday. That's reassuring. Why "since yesterday"? When did she disappear, exactly? Well... We don't know for sure. She didn't come to dinner last night either. And nobody was worried? We have an absent employee. Are you telling me she didn't sleep here? That's probable. Her afternoon tea was on the table. She must have left after lunch. Alright, listen. We're interrogating everybody to find out as much as possible. I will let you know if something happens. Of course. Dad, wait. - We should check her room. - What for? Maybe we'll find something. If you want to. Let's go! People here are nice. Something serious happened to her. She's almost 100 years old. - She's 85. - An old lady sleeping outside. She must be dead. - My mother is dead. - Stop it! It's all my fault. I should have never brought her here. I killed her. I killed my mother. Mom. - Can't you help me? - No. We must stay strong. I'm sorry I acted like that. - Grandma is in good health. - Yes. She's in her right mind. There's no reason to worry. We received a call from her retirement home. It's not the first time. It's a real sieve. What can we do, concretely? Concretely? Nothing. Can't you look for her? There are appeals on TV. Can't we do the same? You want a search operation? - Why not? - OK. So... First question: Is your mother an adult? Don't get angry. I'm not angry. I'm not angry at all. He asks if my mother's an adult. - That's the question, right? - Exactly. - Calm down. - I am calm. I asked you a question. Answer me. I'll give you an answer. Surprisingly, yes, she's an adult. You know why? - Because she's older than me. - That's what I needed to hear. I had to hear you say it to know if a search is needed. We can't search for your mother. We only do it when they're minors. We receive many cases. A mother cannot be younger than her son! - You yell at me? - Yes! - Yes. - Let's go, Dad. Leave me alone. I'm OK. Everything's OK! Jean-Marie, see them out. I always find good spots. As for the rest... Do you have any news? No, no news. Oh, wait. I killed my mother. I'll lie down and take a dying pill. Sleeping pill. I don't know what to do. Have you noticed his mood? Yes, but it's temporary. It has been temporary for a while now. Clearly, you don't live with him. His father dies, he has problems with her mother... But I'm still here. You know what I think? He got a little... After he retired. But I can't take it anymore. I try to be strong but... I don't want to sink with him. It was my first year as a teacher. I must have been about 22. One day, after class, someone called me. "Miss! Miss!" So I turned round, and what did I see in front of me? A young man. I was surprised, of course. I was dazed. Can you imagine? Everybody was looking at us. I didn't know that man. Suddenly, he said: "You're so beautiful that I'd rather not see you again". That was it. And then he left. - Just as he came. - It was Dad. Yes, it was Dad. I know I've told you that story before. Who are you talking about? Someone I haven't seen for a while. It happens. I can't find the sleeping pills. Second drawer, in the night stand. 47... - And you are? - Pasteau. - P-A-S-T-E-A-U? -Yes. 49. There you go. - Good night. - Thanks. Sorry. Did you get my message? Are you OK? I'm OK, but I've had one hell of a day. I'll prepare you a drink. Are you sure? I have work. Yes. It's a rosé, so no alcohol. What about your grandma? She's disappeared. We don't know where she is. Old people often leave. We force them to do what we want. Actually, you're right. Alright. Cheers to your grandma? To my grandma! Hello, Delphine. It's Karim. I'm leaving you a message. Maybe you didn't write down my number. Maybe you had no signal or you erased my message accidentally. Or maybe someone in your family died. So I understand you didn't call me. I'll leave you my number again. It's 06-86-30... I'm sorry but... What? Who are you? A postcard from my grandmother! A postcard? Do they still exist? Great! She's OK. Glad to hear. I've been reading some things on the Internet... - You know, they kidnap... - Stop it! - There are no limits anymore. - Please, stop. Where is she? I don't know. Turn it over. - Paris, Saint-Lazare. - She probably took the train. Where do those trains go? Normandy. She was born in Etretat. Alright. You have to go there. Cool. It's just like an episode of 24. - Only slower, and older. - No, wait. It can't be so simple. Yes, it can. As someone said: "Obviousness is only real when its reality is obvious". - I didn't get that. - Me neither. In Barbès, an old lady was tied up... - Stop! - With clothes pegs. Don't you think you've read it enough? Why did she write to you and not me? That's not important. What matters is that we've heard from her. I guess you're right. - Be careful on the road. - OK. I can't go with you. Your mother needs me. She's going through a lot. Yes, I know. It's important you stay with Mom. You know, I've been reading. - You've been reading. - Yes. The thing is... She's going through a retirement crisis. A retirement crisis? You always hear about teenage crisis... But retirement crisis is dreadful. But Mom isn't retiring. She's always ahead. You're not having a retirement crisis? No, not at all. On the contrary. I'm finally enjoying all my passions. - You have passions? - Yes. Plenty. First of all, your mother. I know. She's a pain, but I love her. Without her, I'm nothing. She's my passion. I love her so much. Don't lose time. Oil and tires are OK. The car is in top shape. Alright, go! Hello, sir. Have a seat. How can I help you? I want a ticket to Melbourne. Bitches! Take the Twix. - Why? - Because there's two of them. 1,40 euros. Thank you. Goodbye. Hello. Thanks. Goodbye. Excuse me. - Another Twix? - No, it's not that. It's just... It's very hard to make choices in life. We're all a bit lost. But you came up with an answer. It's kind of cool. I just recommended you the Twix. Yes, it's true. I was thinking that, since you have some knowledge in chocolate bars, you might know a thing or two about women. - Women? - Yes. What should I do to find my soul mate? Stop waiting for her. - You think that'll work? - Of course. If you stop waiting for her, you'll find her within a day. OK. - Alright. Thanks. - No problem. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hello. - Hello. Can I have a list of hotels in Etretat, please? Yes, of course. We're off season, so I recommend you call the Roches hotel. Really? Why? Because my brother-in-law is the owner. - He'll give you a discount. - Alright. - Bye. - Goodbye. - Maybe you... - You want to commit suicide? Well, no. Not at all. Why? I see you coming and going. You're hesitating. We have the best place for that. I bet you have many reasons to end it all. But I have to warn you. You go to the cliff, like this. You get here. And then you jump, of course. If it's windy, you go back. You'll bounce here. Ouch! And you land here. Then, you moan until help finds you. I'm doing you a favor. I'm not planning on committing suicide. I love life. Your face does not agree. It's contradictory. OK. I was wondering, have you seen this lady? Why? It's my grandmother. She's missing. Maybe she came here. - I saw her yesterday. - Really? At the city hall. I work there, too. She asked for some information about the school. She wanted a list of students. The Maupassant school? She was a student there when she was little. Did she tell you where she was staying? Yes. She's at the hôtel des Falaises. Maybe it's the lady sitting over there. She's having tea. Thank you. Look who's here. It was about time. Nathalie! It's Romain. - He found Mom. - Where was she? In a hotel in Normandy. Strangely enough, I wasn't worried. She's temperamental. I'm not surprised she left. It's not the right thing to do. Who cares about that! You're a pain in the ass! You have to live life. No, I mean, I agree. We should live our lives. It's too late for me. I don't want to live with you anymore. I want a divorce. You can keep everything, I don't care. I can live anywhere as long as I'm far away from you. You can't be serious. Why are you being so mean? I've met someone. - Who is it? - You don't know him. All I can tell you... is that he's real, he's handsome, he makes me feel good and alive. And he's young. I wanted to do something by myself. Do you understand? I want to make my own decisions. I understand. You scared the hell out of everybody, you know. I'm sorry. Yeah, right. What did you want to do here? I grew up in this town. We had to leave because of the war. So I had to quit school in the middle of the year. That was awful for me. I hadn't been back here since. - It's beautiful! - Yes, it's beautiful. Yes, she's doing fine. I'll join you. I'll take the next train. I think she wants to be alone. She said that? Well, yes. Of course she did. Why do you say that? Nobody wants to see me. What is that nonsense? Did you tell Mom I found Grandma? Yes. She celebrated the good news by asking me for a divorce. You'll be a child of divorced parents. You'll end up in the streets. Dad, she probably said that because she was pissed. And she's a cougar. Did she do that to annoy me, too? - A what? - A cougar! Your mom's a cougar. You don't know the whole story. She has a boyfriend. He's your age. Your mother is a cougar. OK, calm down. I spent my life with a cougar and you want me to calm down? She's a cougar. She sleeps with young boys. What if I did that? Don't worry, it won't happen. Nobody wants me. Are you done yet? Yes, I'm done. You're right. I'm actually done. I don't have a reason to live. Tell Grandma I love her. Stop with the nonsense. Dad, you know we need you. Yes. That's very nice of you. You won't leave me, will you? No, I won't leave you. You're going to take a pill and get some rest. You will feel better tomorrow. If you say so. OK, I love you. I love you too. Damn! Astina hotel. - Philippe? - Yes. Hi, it's Romain. Hi, Romain. How are you? I'm good. What about you? I'm fine, thanks. I wanted to tell you, I might be staying a couple of days. No problem. Take your time. I'm working at night. I feel your age again. OK. It hasn't changed much. I loved this playground. The day I had to leave, all the students were here. They waved me goodbye. We can go in if you want. No. Not now. Let's go back to the hotel. I didn't know her name yet. Louise. I didn't know she had been a teacher for 3 years. She was in charge of the 3rd grades. I didn't know that she used to hunt snails. But she always set them free out of guilt. I didn't know she liked the rain. It meant she could wear her red boots. She liked to read in the bathtub and she could take up to 6 baths a day. I didn't know anything of that when she came to me and said... - Can I help you? - Yes. Hello. Do you work here? Of course. Are you a teacher? - Yes. - Alright. So, my grandmother was a student here when she was a kid. And we go up to the sky. Squashed-cat position. Are you screwing my wife? Excuse me, sir? I offered yoga classes to my wife. Yoga classes. Do you hear? Not screwing classes! Does he screw you too? Is it all-inclusive? Get out of here. We're open to the world. Why is he saying you're a cougar? Your father didn't understand so I told him I was with someone. He still didn't get it, so I told him he was young. - Alright. So it's not true. - Of course not, honey. - Do you know what he did? - No. He thought it was my yoga instructor. So he tried to beat him up. No! Really? - Yes! - Damn! So he beat him? Is he insane or what? I think he is! Anyway, he reacted to something, so that's good. Sure. It's do or die. - How's your grandma? - She's OK. I have a surprise for her. That's nice of you. You should find yourself a girl. I have to go now. I love you. I love you too, honey. - Bye, Mom. - Bye. Good evening. Hello, sir. What can I get you? I'll take a beer, please. Thank you. There. Good evening. What can I get you? Well... I don't know. I would like to get drunk. But I can't have anything strong. I have a weak liver. And I'm going through a lot. Anyway, I won't bother you with my problems. - I shouldn't... - Will you make up your mind? A beer. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Cheers! Another one? Oh boy! It's the gases. Do they bother you too? It's the kind of chick... That girl is perfect for me. Don't move. Go ahead! OK, got it. I'll send it to a friend. - Look how beautiful we are. - Oh yes! Oh, Jesus! - What? - It's my friend. I think he's a gerontophile. That's a wreckophile to me. That was funny. Hilarious. I love... I love funny women. OK. What were we talking about? - You were talking about La Rochelle. - Yes. That wasn't his actual name. It wasn't. So... People don't know this but he lived in Saint-Malo at first. He signed his first books as Drieu Saint-Malo. Then, he moved to La Rochelle. OK. So, tell me. Where does "Stéphanie" come from? Well, it's French. Shut up! Oh, damn! Silence! Silence, please! So... Good morning. Today, we have a very special guest. Say hello to Madeleine. - Hello, Madeleine. - Hello, everyone. In fact, Madeleine was a student here at the beginning of the 1940s. But she had to leave. So, after a short break, she's back in school. I hope you will encourage her. Yes. Madeleine, you can seat in front of Anaïs. Thank you. So... So, we are going to do a dictation. First, I'll tell you the title. So, the title goes first. "The ink drinker". Start a new line. Hi, poop chute! Hello, poop chute! - That's it. I found her. - What? I've found the love of my life. Isn't she a bit old for you? No. Why? We're talking about last night's chick, right? No, that's Monique. She's a friend. This girl's name is Louise. She's a teacher. I brought my grandma to her class. There's something going on. It's good news! That's clever. You pulled the grandma card. "I take care of an old lady". Yes. Is that Pokémon back there? Yes, I'm playing. Shit, she's calling me. I'll call you back. Bye. How did it go? Good. We did a dictation. Everybody wanted to help Madeleine. Did you get a good grade? I was lost. Madeleine! What is it? No, children. Let her finish. Please! You have something to show me? Let's see what it is. - Where to? - There. - Over there? - Yes. Alright, so straight on. Let's go. She's sweet. Yes. She's very happy here. Why the smile? I was thinking about yesterday, when I saw you for the first time. Our colleagues and I thought that... - What? - That you were a pedophile. A pedophile? Because you were there, standing. Nobody knew you. It was weird. - That's why you were looking? - Yes. I thought it was my charm. What do you study? Want to know? Well yes, of course. OK. - What do you study? - Literature. You want to be a teacher? No, I would like to be a writer. - Really? - Yes. - Really? - Well, yes. You want to? You're writing a book? - Yes. - What is it about? It's about the past. And the present? The present is an interesting topic, too. - Hi, Grandma. - Hello, Rachid. No, I'm Karim. - Oh, you're Karim. - Yes. Karim. - Are you thirsty? Hungry? - No, I'm good. I hadn't been here in a while but I've been working a lot. I work. It takes a lot of time, you know. Please, I don't speak Arab. Stéphanie? What a coincidence! I didn't know you worked here. I told you. But I had forgotten. - Yes. - What are you doing? I'm with my grandmother. Grandma. Come here. Grandma, Stéphanie. Hello, miss. Hello, madam. Yes, tell me. Did you have a DS when you were a kid? A car? - A DS. - Why are you laughing? - A game console. - One at a time. It's a game console. No, I didn't have that, at all. Was your life in black and white? I don't understand. When you were little, were you old or young like us? When I was little, I was even more little than you. Why did you quit school? Because of the war. I had to leave with my parents. How old were you when the war started? I was 9. OK, go ahead. Did electricity exist? Well yes, of course! That was a nice question, my dear. You know what we're going to do now? - No. - You'll make a drawing so that Madeleine will have a reminder of this day. That's nice. You can get started, but be quiet. I'll give you some. Are you OK? Wait for me here. I'll go get the keys. - Hello. - Hello, sir. 42, please. Grandma! - Grandma! - I'll call the emergency. We have an old lady who has just fainted in the stairs. We need your help right now. Did she do anything in particular lately? Well... I don't know. Was she tired today? Today? I don't know. Why? Do you think that... You know, at a certain age, the body lets go. Sadly, we can't do much. She's under observation now. Don't worry. I'll come back later. - OK. - Alright? Hello? - Mom. - Oh, honey! Your father called me. He took a train. He will join you. It's my fault. Of course not. Your grandmother decided to live all that. You should be proud of her. You think so? Yes. And she did well by doing it. But, Mom... Are you really going to leave Dad? Of course not! Don't worry. We're all a bit lost right now. But it's not so serious. I'm thinking of you, dear. I miss you. I miss you too. You better go. I love you. I'll see you very soon. - Bye. - Goodbye, honey. You know what, Grandma? You and I are going to make a trip. Where to? I have New York, Berlin. And I have Rome. I like Rome. What do you think? You know what? We'll go straight to the center. What are Rome must-sees? The Coliseum, the Trevi Fountain... It's the Dolce Vita fountain. People like to throw a coin into it, for luck. Let's go to a restaurant. What do we have here? "Al Vantagio. "Tasting menu: 170 francs, wine included. "Pergola. "Einsbeck is more Italian than many of the local restaurants. "It mixes a Roman and a Mediterranean cuisine. "It has a magnificent garden "on the roof. "Specialty: spaghetti all'acqua di pomodoro "con tartufi di mare in salsa di basilico "e prezzemolo. "Specialty..." I don't know what it means. Is your coffee good? These machines have disgusting coffee. Excuse me. Are you the family of 114? - What? - 114 is yours? Yes. We will transfer the body. You asked for a transfer to Paris, right? - Are you her son? - Yes. I will need you to come with me in order to identify the body. Why? You need to sign a release. I took the wrong corpse once. - It was hell. - Wait. It was my grandmother. No confusion there. Of course not. But last year, I had to take a lady to Marseille. When I got there, the family told me it wasn't her. I said, "How come?" But the guy said it was not his mother. I looked at him and then at the lady. I believed him. He knows his mother better than I do. You can't even imagine the complications. Anyway! No release, no transfer. I'll be waiting in the morgue. - Do you want some coffee? - No, not in the mood. Come on. We'll have a coffee. If you want to. - This is nonsense. - Go talk to him. - Sure? - Yes. Come on, go ahead. Good evening. I'll take the Twix. Yes. I like Twix. There's two of them. Alright. That will be 1,40 euros. Thank you. Anything else? I'd like to talk to you. I have a problem with my wife. She told me that... She wanted to leave. She met someone. The thing is, I don't know what to do. When the present doesn't move forward, focus on the past. Thank you. So, how are you? I'm OK. - Do you go out? - A little. Sometimes you have dark rings under your eyes. Yes, but I work into the night. I know you like the subject. You like everything. Hello, miss. Hello. You're so beautiful that I'd rather not see you again. That was so cute! Who is he? My future husband. Michel. Michel! When we look at this hole in which we place a body, we ask ourselves: What is the meaning of life? If death always comes, what is the meaning of elevation if we end up in the ground? Jesus has opened a door to answer that question. Give everything. Everything you are, everything you have. That's what Madeleine did. She gave everything. Our life is bigger and better because of her. Love is a gift we pass on. Madeleine gave us what she received from us, her family, her friends. And from God. Since the beginning, that love and kindness was born from God. Because since the beginning of times, He hasn't stopped giving. In a perfect way. He even gives Himself. That's what love is. To give and take. It was a beautiful ceremony. Very touching. Everyone was here. It was nice. - Will you be OK? - Yes. What about you? We're going to be fine. Well, have a nice journey, my dear. Thank you. For everything! Sir! Sir! Hello. I didn't see you before. Thank you for inviting me. You wanted me to be here. Yes, of course. I'm painting again. Thanks to you both. Here. This is for you. Thank you. So, it's... It's chickens. Well yes! Chickens. It's beautiful. Thank you very much. I have to go. See you soon. See you soon. Romain! I'm so sorry. I went to the wrong cemetery. The wrong cemetery? I don't know, I thought... Don't worry, it's no big deal. You're here, so... Do you want to go for a drink? Yes. I'd love to. - A gift? - Yes. A gift at a funeral? Well, yes. It's a painting from an artist my grandma and I liked. Can I see it? Come on! Sorry. It's natural, the first time you see it. Oh, alright. - You can have it. - That's nice of you. But I can't have it. There are no walls where I live. - A house without walls. - It's a new concept. - It lights up the rooms. - You can't hang anything. - Thank you anyway. - No problem. Subtitles: ECLAIR MEDIA
