The Magnificent Seven Hi, guys. I've come a long way, buddies. I'm looking for Ali Osman Narlýkuyu in your village. - Do you know him? - It's me. - I'm here to take you with me. - Where to? - To court. - Why? Why I'm going to court? Musa Red will be executed for your false statement. You will go and tell the truth. If you don't come, I'll take you by force. You can't take me anywhere. I've nothing to do in court. - Don't make me use force. - I won't come! You have been lying your entire life. You'd lie to make money. To feed you! You've ruined a lot of people's lives. At least tell the truth in the last days of your life. Musa Kýrmýzý will be hanging because of your lie. C'mon, Ali Osman. It's time, to tell the truth. And that's your job? Making good things or telling the truth is a duty of all people. I will take Ali Osman. And nobody can stop me. Leave the village, right now! Don't get mixed up. Try not to confuse the peasant mind. Go away, go away. Nothing ever frightens me. I'll take Ali Osman no matter what it takes. Don't try to stop me, or I'll shoot. Don't move, or I'll kill you. - Ali Osman, come along. - OK, I will. He has taken Ali Osman to tell the truth. As a young man... Shall I tell the truth? Than lose my house, ruin bread and exile from the country? Let me go. You've been through so much. Instead of teaching the truth, you do evil deeds. We're poor people. Whoever meets our needs, we serve him. You starting something new? It is wrong. And you must be on the right side. You've to stand up to this injustice. Man is only human when he is honest. If we want to be entitled to live, we must be honest people. It is impossible for me to live anymore. Go to court and tell the truth. Get him to spill everything. They'll teach you what're good things after death. Take this! - May the man live again? - Impossible. Four bullets hit him. So he tried to tell him the truth? Can he try it now from the grave? - Are you still awake? - Yes, I am. I can't sleep. I always think that guy. He fluttered like a bird. He's covered in blood. He wasn't scared or shrink. He has not begged. His last words were: I can't live anymore. Go to court and tell the truth. Save an innocent man's life. Tell the villagers what I've done wrong so far. Set a good example for them! He was right. I'm a filthy filthy man! I'm a sick and disgusting person. I've to tell truth. They don't allow it. They'd drive you out of the village or they will kill you. No matter what they do, I'll go and tell the truth! Ali Osman has left the village. He will go to court. He is a foolish one. Go to bring him here. C'mon. And in honor of you, Doc. Hey! Where do you take to him? None of your business. - Now, it is our business. - Really? - Did he kill your father? - No. - Did he kill your mother? - No. - Did he stole something? - No. - Let him go. - If we will not? Thank you. A bullet was given to everyone as a gift, without making a torpedo for anyone. Keep this for yourself as a souvenir. And don't harass people unfairly. You've been spared this time. Now get your horses and go quietly. I don't want to come across again. Let show them our last hospitality. C'mon. C'mon. Hey! Bring him here. I'm a witness. There are two more people like me. A pregnant woman was killed in our village. We know who is the killer. But SÄ±rtlan told us to lie. And all of us did what he said in court. We've all lied. Now, I want to go to court and tell the truth. But SÄ±rtlan won't let me go. His men will follow me. He has a lot of money, men, and gun. Too many people have ruined because of us. One guy has been dead as young. And the other one will be unjustly executed. Please, help me. Take me to court. I'll show you. Have we earned a good deed? Thank you. You just arrived at the time. If you do not come on time, we get full of bullets. How can I ever thank you? It is so easy. A kiss, perhaps? And we'll call it even. He has a bad temper. Whenever he sees a good woman, he can't take it. I can't stand it when I see an immoral man, too. I'd pull the trigger. My name's Ketayun. They usually call me Keti. I've come from Iran. Those bastards killed my father three months ago. And now, they want to kill me. But it is not easy to kill me. I'm glad to thank you for your helping. And who are you? So we are... We are... What they used to call us? - Can't anyone tell? - Probably, you haven't been educated. We are not things like... So you tell us, Doc. We are illegal people. So we are illegal people. Bu we're good. We wouldn't even hurt an ant. We like people, animals or birds. We're enemies of bad people. They are afraid of meeting us, including Azrael. If the devil sees us in his dreams, he will wake up. I'm glad to know you. You seem like brave and good men. I can't live here anymore. If you agree, I will come with you. You will be harmed by us. Surrender you to the police? Should they throw me in jail at a young age? The police is coming for us. They are searching for us. Too many enemies, we've got. We take your crimes upon us. Go surrender to the police. You'll come off worst if you come with us. If you disagree, I'm going to the mountain alone. I have to. Whatever you say. - She can. - They agree about you coming. All good. So this is Doc. One year before he graduated from school, he had an accident. He's been with us for three years. He handles a knife just fine. Meaning of his name benevolent. He killed a significantly older woman. To please God. I met a woman on my hike. She was aged and walked very hard. And she begs God. If dying will better me, may I die? And she said that I'm so tired of this life. She was crying. They called me Benevolent. I felt sorry for the woman. I asked some questions. She answered the same things. She wanted to die, etc. Is it okay to miss out when I found what I wanted? I said to her, close your eyes. So she closed her eyes without what was going on. I prayed the God and killed that woman. I shot her in the forehead. And this is our cowboy. His name is Cowboy Ahmet. He killed four people before he joined us. He writes his signature with bullets. He is Panther. He is fearless. We escaped the prison together. He can shoot a flying bird in the eye. He is as fast as the wind and deadly. This is our youngest fugitive. This is Tertip. He killed three people for love. And he is Magpie. When he sees beauty, he loses himself. I beg your pardon! And you? They called me Banoş. I've been an outlaw since I was twenty. We are trying to help justice now. We're taking him to court. He was a false witness and later regretted it. He wants to tell truth. Men of SÄ±rtlan are following us. If I don't make it to court, they'll hang Musa KÄ±rmÄ±zÄ±. Musa KÄ±rmÄ±zÄ± won't be hanged. We will take you to court! We've been in prison too long. We know what it is. We are often faced with death. If he gets to court, we're screwed. We will go to prison. He can't. All roads are blocked. I heard he took shelter in the Banoş gang. Banoş knows the road better than us. Doesn't matter if he knows. He can't overcome our obstacles. Disperse! Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. Shoot everyone. Don't miss it. - Get well soon. - Thank you. Don't afraid, it's me. - Get well soon, Tertip. - Thank you. The last bullet went very close to my ears. It's no fun anymore, I am getting almost dead. What's about Keti and Banoş? I gave him the dynamite. He knows his job. - What's up? - I am distraught. Too many people died because of me. And I also made the trouble to you. Being in trouble reminds you that you are alive. - Get will soon, Tertip. - Thank you. Hello there. My name is SarÄ± Recep. I realize you and me looking for the same guys. We will be strong if we gets together. They called me SÄ±rtlan. Thank you for the offer. Let's race to find out who's boss. Whoever is a good shooter is the boss. Let's fight. The winner becomes the boss. No one knows me. I fought a lot; I challenged a lot. No one didn't defeat me. - The gunshots stopped. - Is Banoş not injured? Nothing will happen to him. He has always survived such bad events. Did something happen to any of you? - Get well soon. - Thank you. Enough. What about his wound? There is no problem. He's in good condition. How long have you known Banoş? None of us know his past. He never tells anybody anything. He is quiet and looks only at death. He loves us more than life. He is the last one to come from conflict. Does he have anyone... No other family? Or wife? None of us know his past. How long have you known Banoş? None of us know his past. He never tells anybody anything. He only keeps silent and watches. He loves us more than his own life. In all the dangers he's the last one to leave. Doesn't Banoş have anybody? No wife? No kids? Nobody among us knows anything about Banoş' past. Let's see what happens at last. Doc, I abruptly want to own a home. - If I'd be married, have a wife or child. - It is just a dream for us. We can have neither a home nor children. If there is a general amnesty, we will be saved. I am sick of living like wild animals. So do we. But we have to live like this. Well... To live. Let's drink too much for life. Take some to him. I don't understand him, but like. They love you so much. So do I. I love much. They are like my children. I will be distraught if anyone gets injured. You are always looking thoughtful. Why? Go outside. Drop the weapons. Go away. C'mon. Let's go. - Is there anyone missing? - Tertip is not here. - And Benevolent. - And Magpie. - Cowboy and Panther. They did catch our friends. We will hold these guys for Ali Osman and girl. OK. Stop. Don't do anything. We are coming for the deal. We don't think of any wrong ideas. The deal is the best choice for both of us. The four friends were held in pledge. We can kill them anytime. We may release them if you give Ali Osman and girl. Think until tomorrow noon. They will kill us if you give us to them. Too many people died. Let's stop this - let's make up. Now let's just go about our business. You will be harmed at last if you make the wrong choice. So you are... On the one hand, the fellows-in-arms you love... On the other hand, there is us. I don't know your decision but... Whatever decision you make to save your friends is right. Deliver us to them, and save your fellows. You have to think ideally. Don't leave alone your fellows; you know they can die for you. Give Keti and Ali Osman to them. Save your fellows. Don't think I am scared. Just crying, that's all. I am departing you; that's why I am crying. I am so used to you. It was the first time in my life that I felt so close to someone. I'm not saying choose me instead of your friends. Even if you don't want to, I will go and sacrifice. What will you do? Go from the left side to save your life. - What is written? - Go from the left side to save your life. Let them release our friends to us. Let them release our friends to us. And we will give Ali Osman and the girl. First you give. Your friends are in a safe place. Don't scared. After throwing the dynamite, take cover on the ground. Go. Banoş. Banoş. Translated by ismuta KG @2021
