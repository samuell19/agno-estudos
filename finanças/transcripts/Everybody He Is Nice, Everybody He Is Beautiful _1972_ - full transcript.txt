I'm on to something big here. And I'm on to something even bigger. This... No! This is Jean Marc Audibert from Santa Maria Martha, hot spot of the Andes, where Ricardo Salinas, Latin America's new guru has established his HD. I left the grimy hotel where we, journalists, were staying. I've had to hold secret negotiations to get here, as I can't betray my helpers, but I'm now in the middle of this Sierra Nevada among Ricardo Salinas' freedom fighters. Indeed, I'm meeting him shortly. Why isn't he here right now? Here's the answer. These hails of bullets piercing the jungle's silence are the sounds of the regular army's troops fighting Salinas' men before my eyes, as if cruelty is what governs this place called Green Inferno, where snakes, tigers, mosquitos, malaria, and whatnot don't suffice. These men also have to fight... for their freedom. THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH THAT WAS NOT CREATED BY GOD THEREFORE GOD AND JEAN YANNE PRESENT EVERYBODY HE IS NICE, EVERYBODY HE IS BEAUTIFUL What happened? - I'm not in the tropics anymore! - Give me your bag. So what took you so long to come back? A whole lot of crap. I met those guys, but they confiscated my material. - Then I had to hitchhike back. - Everybody else got back already and they're all over the news. Except us! What's this crap all about? Stop the car. - What the hell? - It's true, you didn't know. Plantier's latest idea: Jesus, King of the station. Anywhere and everywhere: on billboards, in songs, in commercials... Yes, sir. And there's more. "...God would have also created Odornet "had he known about those agents that destroy body odor." Jesus is here. The Lord has come! He's even on the hood of the car. I can't make up my mind. Mr. Ringeard, these are the outfits Mr. Plantier ordered. Mr. Plantier ordered those for the hostesses? Children! They are superb! Absolutely splendid! Good day, Mr. Plantier. The outfits you ordered. Really? Let me tell you that it's deeply dismaying! It's gloomy and sinister! We need something young, that stands out, something colorful and bright! I agree, sir. Children, I told you so! It's sinister, gloomy, dismaying. We need something young, brilliant, - colorful! - There! And I'd like to add that I'm thrilled with you! I don't know how you do it, but I am more and more pleased. And I'm pleased that you're pleased... Can I leave you my bag? I don't have to kneel when I get in, do I? RADIOPLUS CLOSER TO GOD - Christian! How are you? - Fine. - It's the Vatican in here. - And Plantier wants to turn us into altar boys! It'll suit you wonders. How about some water in there to make it a holy water font? - Hello, Mr. Gerber. - Hey, spring chicken! - My latest one. - Thank you. And another piece of crap. This one's not bad, girls. Hi, Gerber. Looking good! Still happy about the stuff you sell? With God in our hearts how can't we? - Hello, Brothers! - It can't be! You look handsome, Brother! - The good Lord has taken over. - You don't say? He's everywhere. On the walls... And in commercials too. We're actually about to air one. Get ready, Coco! You're on soon. - You're on. - God is in all things. In music, nature, perfumes, colors. God loves beauty. God loves you. He loves your hair, therefore, He loves Samsoncolor shampoo made with regenerated cadmium. With Samsoncolor God will love your hair. There you go. It's unreal! Morons! How about those freedom fighters? How many did you do? How many times each? - You gave in your tape? - No. - You don't have a tape? - I'll do it live. - It was too good to be true. - Tape or no tape, we're on. OK! Relax! Children, get into gear. Move your butt! Come on, we're in a rush! Fat chance. That's my throne. You've got the voice, how 'bout the plumage... You're annoying! Give me a break! Don't be rude to my sister, my sweet. - And you can? - Unlike you, I'm tactful. Children, finish your orgy so we can get to work. Hurry, there's another commercial. Quick! I have no more music.

India's struggling, Africa's instable, Israel's council is scheduled to meet, and South America, it's not all rosy. We can now address this issue. Our deputy editor has returned after 1 month on the field, Mr. Gerber has details. Yes, details concerning our fellow journalists' ethics. Because everything that was said about Ricardo Salinas' freedom fighters is false. Indeed, the other stations' reports are all entirely fixed, and no one saw Ricardo Salinas, except for myself, I must say, which was relatively dangerous. I'd like to add that these freedom fighters are not antiquated bandits, but sincere patriots, loyal to Che Guevara's ideology. And that's information our... He's crazy! Absolutely crazy! ...while these gentlemen indulged themselves "in 3-star hotels and whisky bars. Yes, Mr. Chairman! Yes, Mr. Chairman. As we speak. Of course. Of course, Mr. Chairman. I'm on it. Goodbye, Mr. Chairman. Bring me Gerber as soon as the news are over! In this profession, one single rule must prevail: honesty. Unfortunately, it's increasingly scarce. OK. Thank you, Christian Gerber. We'll resume in just a moment. But first, a commercial break. At the Cana wedding, Jesus asked to serve the good wines first, and the bad ones last. Nowadays, there'd only be good wines, the wines from Blazing Climbing Vine. Natural, fruity, fragrant: Blazing Climbing Vine wines. Drink of it, all of you, as this is good wine. Come in! What's next? "RadioPlus, closer to gadgets"? We've been closer to women, to youth, to nature, to couples, to sex, and now, to God. Yes, God, Gerber! But Jesus, mostly. We need to adapt to our time. And this stands out! Jesus Christ, superstar. Posters... Look at these. It's obvious, Gerber. It's not questionable. Record jackets, stickers, badges... Badges, Gerber! You think that works in radio? I believe what's trendy. I'm not an eternal skeptic like you! I've never seen you take one of our campaigns seriously. You don't have the radio station spirit, Gerber. You're a loner, when it comes to work. It has paid off a few times, but that's not enough for me, Gerber. Just like your little speech on Che Guevara. And your explanations about the freedom fighters. were not at all convincing. And the chairman's not too fond of your criticism either! He just called me. Be careful, because... - The chairman sends you this. - OK. Get lost! There you have it, Gerber. The chairman's reaction. - What is it? - It's your head, Gerber. As a matter of fact, the chairman loves gadgets. And this is what he does when he wishes to dismiss one of our colleagues. Are you saying I'm fired? Sir, your wife is on her way. Good Lord! My wife? Are you sure? - That's what she said. - You shouldn't have! She can't find me. She wants to kill me! Please, you need to help me out! Tell her you're covering for me, anything... I'll be in the washroom. Here, it stands out. Where's the scumbag? There are many in radio stations! Plantier, my husband! - I'm going to slash him! - With this? Give it back! I need it! That's all he deserves. Calm down. Sit down. Let's have a talk. - You had a disagreement? - More than a disagreement. He institutionalized me for 3 months! He wanted people to think I was crazy. And I'm not crazy! Of course not. You need to calm down. Come on, tell me everything. Well, OK, doctor. I used to be an alcoholic. But I'm detoxed now. He turned me into an alcoholic in the first place. With everything I had to put up! Since he didn't want to pay my rent, or give me money, he decided to put me in a mental home. Bastard! Bastard! It's all about God on his lousy radio, but I can assure you he's still a bastard! I swear to you that he's a bastard! I believe you! I'd even say he's the king of bastards. Don't do this to yourself, not for a bastard. Look at me. You're young, you're pretty... - Really? - Of course! But what am I going to do? What am I going to do? When I met Plantier, I was an actress. - So you'll go back to acting. - I lost all my contacts. - I don't know anyone anymore. - I do. I'll help you if you promise to stop chasing him to kill him. - Do you know Marcel Jolin? - No. Who is he? Marcel Jolin was a presenter here. He was fired in... in 1961. Since then, he's been running the People's Interurban Theatre. He stages Brecht, Ionesco, a bunch of people. You have an interesting face. I'm sure he'll like it. I'll use one of Plantier's cards... - No! The bastard! - No, no! Come on... Fine. My name is Gerber. Here's my private number because in a few days I may be history. - So take this... - Yes. - There. - Thank you. And you're going to go back home quietly. And promise me you won't come back. - Yes. - Promised? - Yes. - OK. Goodbye, madam. Goodbye, doctor. - Nice going! - She's crazy, I swear! That's extreme! Please don't say anything. Let's keep it shush. - Especially here... - I was fired, remember? I need another job and my job is to inform... I'll speak to the chairman. Don't worry, I'll fix it. But you can't work in the news anymore. I'll name you Supervisor of Artistic Programs. - That position doesn't exist. - But we need it. You'll be perfect for it. What will it consist of? We'll get to it later, OK buddy? "Jesus Christ ate fish. Follow his footsteps. "Every day, on our table, "sardines and sea breams are as fresh as they were back then. "Trust fish merchants "and the labels 'Quality Fish.' "A quality fish for Christians who have taste." - What's that? - It's a gadget. A game. We'll use it in a sweepstake. Let me see. It's dumb. - Did you get my package? - Yes. Did you fire that idiot? No, he asked for a severance pay. But he's out of the news. I named him Supervisor of Artistic Programs. - That position doesn't exist. - Exactly. We created it for him. - What will it consist of? - Well... We'll get to it later. "Before our eyes, a cathedral of leaves. "These are the pillars of bark and the paving of moss. "The organs of the wind burst into plainsong melodies "whose echoes are muffled in the fern. "The forest wakes up and the harbinger appears. "It was 'My head is ill,' a show by Mimi Chaperon..." - Here you are. - What? The cook's son had 2 of these. OK! "No, madam. "God created the peanut so you could serve up Suavilor, "the ultra-pure oil, lighter than an angel's feather. "With Suavilor, prepare simple and easy-to-digest meals. "If your kids or your husband commit the sin of gluttony, "they'll be forgiven, "because even God loves Suavilor." Look at my ass in these. There's no way! - It's fine. - How does it look? Let's see. Walk a little. It's great. Model it for me. You look like Joan of Arc. They'll be happy to see you up there. I'm not wearing that piece of crap! - I'm not wearing that crap! - Plantier's orders! Mr. Supervisor is here! Supervisor my ass! Look at what I found. Isn't it pretty? - Your office is ready. - I saw that. - Have you ever had caviar? - Once. At a friend's house. - Is it good? - It tastes like... tuna. - What do you eat it with? - With fish cutlery, obviously! Don't you have typewriters? - I don't know how to type. - Me neither. - And stenography? - I don't know. Dunno. - Who put you here? - Mr. Andrieux, chief of staff. We're doing a stage to become hostesses. Since we don't speak English, they don't want us downstairs. So what can you do? - We can walk, right Lucette? - Yes, we can! Then walk. You can stay in my office. You'll have more space to walk. If someone asks for the supervisor tell him he's gone supervising. Can you do that? - Yes. - Great. "RadioPlus! RadioPlus! RadioPlus!

RadioPlus! RadioPlus! "Jesus!" I'm Sylvestre Ringeard, always happy to have you on RadioPlus. On today's edition of "Truth, Truth," Father Derugleux is with us. You will thus be able to confess and we're ready for a call. Mrs. Josepha Bourgivon, from Namur. - Yes? - Hello? Mrs. Bourgivon? We're listening. Well, Father, I have been married for... I'm sorry, this is Sylvestre Ringeard. - Really? - Yes. But Father Derugleux is here. I've been having thoughts... How much can I say here? It happens when I watch movies, special movies, or magazines... Then when I get home, with my son's friends... I empathize with you. But I need to interrupt you now as we need to take more calls. Unless there's something crucial you need to say. What penance would you inflict your interlocutor? She only needs to collect her thoughts, sincerely repent, and recite Hail Marys and paternosters. - Anywhere between 6 and 10. - Between 6 and 10, madam. Father Derugleux is not very strict. - As many for each, Father? - Excuse me? - As many for each? - Yes. Good. So Father Derugleux gives you absolution. Next sinner, please. Miss Antoinette Moujard, from Clermont-Ferrand. Hello? - Mrs. Moujard? - Yes. - Father Derugleux is listening. - I'm listening, child. - A woman, I assume? - Go ahead, madam. Bless me Father, for I have sinned. I'm sorry? I can't hear you. Bless me for I have sinned! You're on, madam. Hello, Mrs. Moujard? - Go ahead, confess. - I can't hear you. We hear you very well. Go ahead, confess. Go ahead, madam. Hello? Hello? There's a little problem, we lost our caller. Let's take another call. Mr. Sebastien Chaumont, from Villejuif. We're out of luck, we're having phone problems. No other calls? Place to the music, then. Enough with that phone, for Christ's sake! Oh, sorry, Father. Oh, dear Lord, Make my dream come true Make my heart stop feeling blue His name was Johnny But now he left me Oh, dear Lord, Make her dream come true Make her heart stop feeling blue Oh, dear Lord, Make my dream come true Make my Johnny be true Let him take me away On the expressway Oh, dear Lord, Make her dream come true Make her Johnny come through By his side, oh dear Lord My spirits soared We were free as the wind I couldn't have asked for more Oh dear Lord, you know so well Love shouldn't hurt like hell Get my life back on track Bring me my Johnny back Oh, dear Lord, give her back The sacred love she once had. It seems odd, Father, that you'd be the one voicing your discontent, as you're older and more mature than your "colleague." - Or is it "fellow member"? - We call each other "brothers." - Isn't it so, Father? - Yes, my child. So, my brother, I mean Father, you are older than your child, your brother, or fellow member, so you should embrace tradition, but you think priests should marry. - I do. - You'd like to get married? No, but I know about the anxiety and the doubts that rural priests deal with, it's to say the country priest. Nights can get lonely and they often have the need to feel someone by their side. - And you? - I don't agree. I think celibacy is a sine qua non condition to a priest's serenity. From what I heard you don't have a country parish like your esteemed colleague does. - Indeed. I teach music. - Whereabouts? In a young girls' college. And you've never had the need to form a united Christian couple? No. It's not all about forming a couple. Mr. Gerber just walked in. Perhaps there's a newsflash? Not at all, I'm purely supervising. I overheard you debating while I was in my office, and I found it fascinating. I agree the need to modernize the Church. And we should go even further. It'd happen progressively, obviously. But marriage would be a good start to liberate us. Let's get back to the theme of "liquid communion." Protestants already practice it. Ecumenically speaking there shouldn't be a problem. There's no point. I was actually referring to practicality. How about a host that dissolves for optimal swallowing? Or effervescent hosts, which when mixed with baking soda, help digestion in people prone to stomach aches? We could even come up with a whole campaign: "Birthday meal, communion meal. "We drink and eat our fill. "Morning comes, we feel ill, "but thank the Lord for the fizzy pill." We could also have a written slogan: "No more hiccups, little Jesus, you're a genius." I had to travel to get here! - I'll complain to my uncle. - I'll call the archbishop! Marriage shouldn't be taken lightly. People don't walk into it... blindly. "The toll for the weekend: 186 injured, 65 dead. "Among the dead... "It's about the catastrophe..." - Are you off your rocker? - What? You've gone too far! It's completely distasteful! Do you enjoy offending honest people? Speaking of honesty, I heard from your wife. She's rehearsing with Marcel Jolin. She's great. "...40,000 civilians dead." RadioPlus. It's 2 AM. We're going off the air. We'll be back at 6:30 AM. Goodnight. May the Lord be with you. She doesn't seem to like the Lord. - Well, at this late hour... - I've had it! I worked from 12 to 6 PM yesterday and now the late show. - Unbelievable. - You're a saint. You're here? I was hoping we could have some fun. Not tonight. I have a date with my guy. You're missing out. Have time for a drink? I can't tonight. We have to do all the recordings. Tomorrow, we're redoing the Jesus campaign. What has to be redone? All the texts. Apparently, it's not good. I'll do some. I'll come up with some Jesus material. - Why not? - I'll redo some. - Wanna hear? - Sure, go ahead. That's good. - It's a nice tango. - It is, isn't it? - You can sing for us? - I don't sing. - So? - Let's have you sing. Can you stand up? You can't do it kneeling. - What? - Don't kneel! Do it in Spanish. - Use a Spanish accent. - OK. I'll play it once. Here it comes. - Just a second. - I got it. They'll get their Jesus campaign. Here we go.

No, the program should be focused on God! - You're mocking our clients. - The Temple merchants? I order you to cut it! - Go to hell. - You're so crass. - You're fired! - No, I'm not.

Here's an exceptional song that programming sent us over. It's the hit of the season. Listen. For Mr. Bernajian, for the students at Sainte-Jeanne-de-la-Desolation, on behalf of Colonel Chalmondier, for his dear Lilou. Mr. Chairman... Go ahead. I'd just like to express my joy and our gratitude to our chairman, Louis-Marcel Thulle, who not only bought most of the shares of our Phosphorus Foods company, but has agreed to chair our board of directors. Mr. Brezier will now present our next campaign. Well, gentlemen, our labs have decided, after consulting with the Marketing and Merchandising Group departments, to launch a new line of dog food. The name of the product was chosen by PR specialists. It will be called Happy Bow-Wow. The budget of the advertising campaign was set at 1 billion old francs. Advertising has not yet been divided among the various media. Posters, displays, samples... I think we can decide right now that 500 million will be devoted to radio advertising. Excellent idea! Of course, Mr. Chairman! On RadioPlus airwaves, naturally! I think all has been said. Please excuse me. I'm glad to see you, Mr. Chairman! Good news! Brezier just called me. We got a 500-million contract to launch a line of dog food, - Happy Bow-Wow. - Very good. - Any other news? - All is well. I got rid of Gerber for good. He was too much trouble. I think I'll beat you this time. How long will you last? We shall see, Mr. Chairman. Set up a timer in my office. I swear, I would've done something for you, but it's really impossible. You went too far, honestly. You yanked too hard on the rope, and you can't do that here. OK, thanks. If you sang, I'd play your records. - Yeah. - Good luck. Bye, Gerber. My benefactor! I've wanted to call you for a while. To thank you, first of all, and to tell you that rehearsals are going very well. - Good. - How are you? - I'm unemployed. - No way! - Yes. - Come with me now, then. I'll drive you. You'll see, it's great. Let's see scene 2, children. Or scene 1. Or 1. Let's do 1. It's the beginning, so let's see scene 1. Let's do 1 again. - Well? - It's a mess! I chose this stupid thing among other dumb things. I've got to do something with it. Sons of bitches! Worse than the bitch I've become! The barely chewed food oozes from your mouths. You can be proud! You think you're Abraham Lincoln! Move forward, preceded by your intestines, filled with dead fish and putrid meat. I hate you! I hate you! Good thing you sent me that messed up girl, because she's great. No one else would've wanted to play that. I'm sure of it: no one. She's so crazy that she could even save the show. Look at her. It suits her! May night fall. Straddle me, as if I were a snooty bitch in which your stiff shaft feasts. Straddle me! Let me give you my Marxist smallpox, that I may contaminate your imperialist grandeur. Throw her out and beat her! Not on the head, it leaves marks! There will be a leveling down, which will come from below the waist. Fight of the hydra against the child in revolt. She wants to slay the giant. But the earth turns inexorably. The earth turns inexorably. Nothing to write home about. Yeah, you can say that again. Stop! Let's take a coffee break. What can I say? Since they fired me like the assholes they are, I had to do something. I chose culture: It was easiest. Here, everything's fine. The city lets me be. As long as there are no elections, they leave me alone. It's just that I take flop after flop. It's 100 years old. What can I say? - Know what you should do here? - No. - Jesus. - Jesus what? Jesus, old boy. I just got fired because of Jesus. You kidding? No, Jesus is in people's morning coffee and evening whiskey. People like Jesus, so sell them Jesus. I'm not gonna stage "The 10 Commandments." No, a modern play. Jesus super something. I'd have to have a Jesus play. I'll do it for you. When we say "my dear friend," we should think about what we're saying. Not say "my dear friend" like we'd say "my dear thingamajig." "My dear friend" is not "my dear friend." It's "my dear, dear friend." Get it, dear friends? Forty-two seconds. I beat you again, Mr. Chairman. It's comforting, my dear friends, to see that in our troubled times, friendship with a capital "F" plays an ever-greater role... That's crap. I don't give a damn about the chairman! "That's what makes friendship..." Such crap! It's crap! "One should always keep that in mind. Friendship..." "Hello, dear friend. You OK, dear friend? - "Yes, my dear friends..." - Total crap. - "We must re-read the texts..." - It's crap! Crap! "The friendship of comrades, and the story of a friendship..." Still crap. - "Suddenly, Jean-Michel..." - It's crap. Crap! - It's crap. - Crap. It's really... the most... horrific... crap... ever. "Hello. Sylvestre Ringeard here, with a new show: "'Let us love one another.' "I know some people will find this organ music a bit joyful, "and call it profane. "But could there be anything less profane than joy? "Our Lord was full of it. I mean, full of joy and hope. "If he'd have played the organ, he'd have played that tune. "'Let us love one another.' Why this title? "Because Jesus said it..." Baronnet, do we control Spot Service for TV advertising? Cancel the 500-million campaign for Happy Bow-Wow on RadioPlus and transfer it to Spot Service. Yes! Yes, the entire budget. It's crap. Plantier, it's crap! Any imbecile could manage this station better. And clients are noticing. The sales department informed me that Happy Bow-Wow withdrew its 500-million campaign. You were careful not to tell me. You're good at playing clackers. For the rest, anyone else could do better. Even the biggest nitwit you ever fired. Who was the latest again? Ah, Gerber. It's for you. - The chairman wants to see you. - What chairman? Chairman Louis-Marcel Thulle. I don't want to see the gentleman. Samuel, hurry! We're late. Hope it works because all of Paris is here. It's a show about Jesus: A miracle could happen. You never know. All the idiots are here. Look at the pervert in the first row. - Incredible! - Look at their faces. Peace in Vietnam Peace in Bengal Peace in the Congo Peace in Yemen Amen Peace in Niger Peace in Iran Peace in Harlem Peace in Aden Amen Mercenary assassins We're not dolls Israel will vanquish over you For the unitarian cause Students, up in arms Access to abortions We're all German Jews Say: "O Jesus Christ" Say: "O Jesus Christ" Say: "O Jesus Christ, amen" Peace in Vietnam Peace in Bengal Peace in the Congo Peace in Yemen Amen Peace in Niger Peace in Iran Peace in Harlem Peace in Aden Amen Mercenary assassins We're not dolls Israel will vanquish over you For the unitarian cause Students, up in arms Access to abortions Fascism will never pass Say: "O Jesus Christ" Say: "O Jesus Christ" Say: "O Jesus Christ, amen" Are you still worried? You should wait for the reviews. You know that as well as I do. The chairman is waiting for you in his car. He's pulling out all the stops. What does he want from me? He'll tell you himself. I don't know what he could say that would interest me, except that he's fired Plantier. Nevertheless, that's it. And his seat is still warm. Is this a joke? They love it! It doesn't interest me. You see, I've found my path here. Isn't this a downgrade? You deserve better. Don't make the chairman wait. And don't make me wait either. I'll be back. I apologize for receiving you in such uncomfortable conditions. It was a radio done by washouts for washouts. And I want intelligent radio for intelligent listeners. You'll have full control. You risk regretting what you've just said. So you accept? If you guarantee me total freedom. We'd have to agree on the meaning of "freedom." By definition, the term assumes no restrictions. OK, I'll take the chance. All right, I'll try my luck. How will they dress us up now? They can dress however they want. - I prepared the managers' list. - Let's see. Hold on... Advertising: 34, art: 24, programming: 17, administration: 41, editorial: 18. - Let's see that list. - Here. A checkmark here, here. That's fine. He's fine. This one's a real twit. He's good. Four in editorial, plus him. How many is that? It's 1, 2... - Eleven. - Eleven, good. Take this down: We're keeping Barthelemy, Andre, Thomas... You want to test the products before running the ads? Indeed! - What about our messages? - In the bin. - Of what use are we, then? - None. I see. Right. Goodbye. Where were we? - At Thomas. - OK, Thomas. What're you playing at? I need all my turntables. I'll take whatever spot I can find. You must be kidding! That's nuts! Let's not idle. Grades, please. - That's a trusty one. - Right. - No. 1? - 1. - No. 2? - 2. - No. 3? - 3. Are you pulling my leg? - I'll taste it again. - What? - I'll test it again. - Go ahead. - 3.5. - All right. - No. 4? - 4. - No. 5? - 5. And that one? - That one's mine. - Right. - Francois! - That's not my name. You drunk? The hair dryers now. Hey! Hair dryers! It's a piece of junk. I tried one and it burns. - I need a grade. - 0. It burns. I've got perfumes here, and beauty creams... I couldn't care less. Sort it out yourselves. So girls, the tights? You call these tights? Look at this. - What? - They're too low. - So? - 3, not even. - No. 2. - Useless. They go up to my armpits: 0. No. 3? They're perfect. - "Perfect"? Look at yourself. - You have room to grow. - What grade, then? - 8. "8"? - Please decide. - 2. OK, 3. No. 4? - There! Those are good. - I'm not wearing any. Idiot! - How's it going, Thomas? - Moving along. - Gross? - Decidedly. - What is it? - It's... No. 1. "Alapapa preserves: Essential to every meal." And may lead to your demise. Who's Alapapa? They ordered 1 million francs' worth of ads. - Screw them. - It'll cost. If we'd stopped La Voisin earlier, there would've been fewer victims. We've just been informed of the sudden death of Edgard Morsain, former minister and leader of the leftist forces, CEO of Regard Morsain industries, a member of boards of directors and a figure in textiles. This is bullshit. He'll be remembered as courteous... Let's not exaggerate. Let's face it: He won't be remembered at all. From the day he lost his appointment "as Transportation Minister in 1957..." Hello? Hello? Speak louder, I can't hear you. Gallichet. Hello, my friend. How are you? What? "Alapapa Preserves"? Your ad campaign was rejected? Must be a mistake. I'll take care of it and call you back. Aurelien Mougerand is listening to our conversation. Come, come. You knew Edgard Morsain well? My goodness! Too well, in fact. Each time we interviewed him, it was a problem. He didn't understand a thing and had nothing going for him. I was talking about him with Sylvain, and without exaggerating, he would've killed his own mother. He drank God-knows-what. He was an alcoholic. He was a pain in the neck in the studio. No picnic. So you see... No reason to lament. Let's listen to some music. At least you tell the truth. I prefer that. We should say he was an idiot. Yes? Christian, phone call for you. Yes? Hello, Mr. Chairman. Yes, Alapapa. No, no mistake. I got rid of them. 300 million or not, I had it tested. We tasted their preserves, and they're inedible. I still have full control, don't I? Good. Talk to you later, sir. He pisses me off. Yes, all right. Mr. Gerber says he'll say what he wants on air. All right. If that's how it is, we'll contact higher authorities. Attention! About-turn. Forward march! 1, 2... 1, 2. - Taste this. - No, I feel nauseous. How will I test the food? No one wants any. We're missing people. - Take the tall one. - She's scared. - I won't swallow that. - No, the beauty products. - With my skin? - Exactly. Call Jolin and ask for Plantier's ex-wife. You're right, she's crazy! Good idea. I've gotten nothing in the new programs. Should I deduce you no longer want to use me? I think you can deduce that. How come? You're wicked and a phony, that's all. You've always played everybody's game. Relationships are passionate, young people delight you, and with God, you experienced boundless joy. I do the radio of truth. RadioPlus, closer to what? Closer to good mood, laughter, and above all, honesty. So you can't take part in that kind of thing. Why not? What you say is true. I am a phony. I've always lied, but with conviction. I can continue to lie, saying I like truth. I'm a pro, Mr. Gerber. You're quite a character. If you're doing the radio of honesty, give me shows for phonies. I don't mind, I am one. I can prove it. - I'm not lying now. - Yeah. We have no one for food products, so you'll be a taster. RadioPlus, closer to the consumer. - Would you like that? - Yes. May I taste? Our political forum. Mr. Aime Gloran de Rabelle, head of the Unified Democrats, who has just released his party's program, will answer questions from the RadioPlus team. The debate will be led by Christian Gerber. So, ladies and gentlemen, ask your questions one by one, and without overlap for greater clarity. I have no doubt, sir, that you'll answer in all honesty. Of course, I'm a man of my word. I've served France under 3 republics. Everyone is fallible, so one never knows. For the greatest precaution, we would ask you to submit to a mere formality. Dr. RadioPlus, our station's doctor, featured on our medical shows, will give you an injection. It's an injection of Penthotal and it's absolutely harmless. No risk. For our listeners, it guarantees that you'll say nothing but the truth. You're crazy. I protest. Please! I wasn't warned. You led me into a trap. There's no risk. My colleagues can confirm it. No! First of all, I hate needles! This behavior goes against the basic principles... - Of politics. - Of courtesy. I hereby rise up against such practices on behalf of my group. Keep your hands off me! My group has always been at the forefront... - You've chickened out? - No. I refuse to take part in this despicable farce. Goodbye, gentlemen. Two projectors have already burned out on the gangway: a pink and a white one. OK, turn it on. Let's see Jesus. No, first the arms. This is the right rhythm. Have you heard? Listen to this. "Is it really worth voting for such useless twits?" Gerber's got some nerve! Shampoo? Toothpaste? Two. What about the water-repellent paint? - It doesn't hold with humidity. - Zero. What about the sheets? Impeccable. Number 3 is crease-resistant. - Isn't it so, Lulu? - She does seem happy. All good here? You may hear some unusual racket in the background. We decided to test every product we promote, including food products... Annie, our loving announcer, brought us a detergent. I brought you Cleanem detergent. It's not better, but it's cheaper. The packaging is cheap so... So you suggest we buy Cleanem. - It contains enzymes. - Thanks, Annie. Our friend Sylvestre Ringeard is on his way. - What did you test? - Hairnet shampoo. But you test food products. I can do both. Hairnet shampoo is great. And Spamgrainless pates too. Too cheap for receptions, but great for picnics. - With onions and pickles. - Thanks, Sylvestre. Another test. Hurry up. Well, I tested newspapers. - And they suck. - We knew that. That was a pointless test. He's coming. - It's for you. - I'm not here. It's a lady. Yes? I really enjoyed your show this afternoon. It was really good. Do you think you'll manage for a long time? I'll try. Good evening. - You must be happy? - I am. And the theatre? It's half empty since your radio show is on. People prefer to stay home and listen to it. Would you like to come and join us? Seriously? You're welcome if you want. A lot of things have changed. This is Sylvestre Ringeard, presenting a radio food test. Yesterday, I tested 12 cans of sauerkraut for you. And only one passed the test: The sauerkraut Djezair Tanauser from the Abdul Saulnier, Nancy. - Makeup? - Three. - Eyeliner? - Five. - Under-eye concealer? - No time. - False eyelashes? - I can't do it all! Consumer test, Sylvestre Ringeard. Yesterday, I tried crab in cans. I tasted 12 cans. One passed the test: the Preguet-Brezenec brand. Consumer test, Ringeard. Eat cans with moderation. - I need to tell you... - What? The Poulard cassoulet... No more Poulard cassoulet. - It's great food. - But not great for your health. I already cancelled the Plastico furniture, the Azur Skin soaps, and the Yatashima motorbikes. - Very good. - I know! No mercy. I know what's going on here. In 2 days, you'll complain about the technical equipment. I'm done testing. Don't complain, it's working. In 2 days, the audience ratings have quintupled. We need a new switchboard. We'll need more staff to sort out the mail. A machine to open letters. I've had it. Listen to this, guys. "Sir, I got paralyzed 6 years ago. "I listened to Mr. Gerber on RadioPlus. "It wasn't loud enough and I got up to turn the volume up. "Yes, you heard right: "I left my wheelchair and walked. "I've been walking normally since. Thank you, Mr. Gerber." - Isn't it fantastic? - Let me write a press release. - What's wrong with you? - Why? He's right. Supernatural is now widely accepted. You're right, we must take advantage of this. "Gerber, the healing voice." Imagine that! It'll be good for us. I can't believe this! Don't you want more listeners? Yes, but to detox them, to open their eyes, not to make them dumber. "Such is the feebleness of the human mind, "the best causes are often gained only "by bad arguments." Ernest Renan. "Ad augusta per angusta." Julius Cesar. "You piss me off." Christian Gerber. Sometimes, I don't understand him. - What should we do? - We can't miss this opportunity. Fine, let's do it anyway. RADIOPLUS THE FIRST RADIO MIRACLE GERBER THE HEALING VOICE - What is this? - Crutches. Your voice heals. Didn't you hear? Pricks! The audience ratings soared, but our listeners are still dumb. You set up this trick? Scum! Don't get angry. We took this decision together. Andre, Thomas, Barthelemy... It's not a trick. It's reality. I want everyone in the conference room. We're in deep shit and it's all your fault. What you did is unforgivable. Especially you. I thought you were honest. There's nothing dishonest. I didn't invent the sick people you healed. I can't believe it. You can't be serious. I just hung some crutches... a few more crutches, I admit. But in a week or 2, they won't all fit in the hall anymore. "Gerber, the healing voice." It's a fact. We can't help it. You can't help it either. We can only accept it. We all know that psychosomatic medicine works better. Lourdes has better results than any other hospital. - Why are you upset, then? - Let the people believe. Let them hope. You're not harming them. On the contrary. You're despicable. The very thing I'm all about is the truth! Haven't I been clear enough? Then you go and toss off the biggest, most vulgar lie ever. You really take people for idiots! Read this. It's about the miracles of the day. Read it. After all, you're a real bastard. You don't have feelings. Human misery... He doesn't care! He couldn't care less. RadioPlus, news of the truth. Good news. The WHO reported that less people die of heart attacks. We're here with Doctor RadioPlus. It's true. But since this statistic is based on world figures, less people die of heart attacks because they risk first of dying of hunger, or car accidents, or because of pollution. Exactly. We hear a lot about pollution. So let me ask you: Do you notice the effects of pollution in patients you examine? I'm a radio doctor. I write magazine articles. I haven't seen a patient in 15 years. - And now, Finances! - Not much to say. The USA have a 25 billion deficit. France and Italy also report deficits. Bravo. The German balance of trade is not great either. Therefore this question: Where is the cash going? Maybe I can answer with these international news. Third-world countries request financial help from most industrialized nations. So where's the cash? Well, when we don't launch pricey bombs on them, we send them tons of gold, which are just as pricey. Let's stick to our stance. We've come out of more delicate situations. Yet, the views expressed on your radio station could harm the implementation of our policy. You'll understand, Mr. Chairman. Of course, Mr. Chairman You're welcome. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Stop the car. Stop. I asked for this discreet interview to speak to you about a source of concern for my company. Surely you know what I'm referring to. I do. You've watched too many horse races not to have a few tips. Sure. Horse race betting is mostly a question of schemes. But when I have a liable tip, I'm not stupid enough to give it away to listeners. The odds would decrease. Let's move on to social issues. The minister of labor is highly concerned about the foreign labor force mainly composed of Portuguese, Arabs and Yugoslavians, especially in the building industry, where non qualified workers provoke accidents. Accidents involving workers or impeding building? Impeding building! We don't care about the workers. So it would no longer bother us. You do understand, Mr. Chairman. I do, Mr. Chairman. Stop. Stop. - Cigar? - No, thanks. It's a pure Havana cigar Directly from Cuba. Well, then... - I wanted to tell you... - Yes? We've had enough of Gerber. He can blame brands, but if factories close, workers won't laugh anymore once they are unemployed... Unions are speaking about it. The Brussels advertisement summit listed the best advertising spaces in the world: the Eiffel Tower, the Pyramid of Kheops, and the Statue of Liberty. Yes, and there are others. Lenin's mausoleum, the unknown soldier's grave... The first page of Mao's Little Red Book. - The Bible... - Pigeons of Venice, too. You'd need binoculars then. Another great space: Moshe Dayan's eye patch. - His picture is everywhere. - It'd be worth seeing! No further comment. Now some music and next, a commercial break. Veronique has new tests. What did you test today? - Frozen trouts. - Oh! - Are you enjoying yourself? - Yes. And the Gaullists? Reception was bad. They'll call back. Should I put a record on? Please, or else they'll talk for hours. - And you? - Me? - Are you enjoying yourself? - I do with your show. But sometimes, I fear for you. - That's nice. - I'm serious. I mean it. You might upset some with your conception of radio. Be cautious. I think we should fire that imperialist reactionary, that fascist crook, that smelly scum of the decadent bourgeoisie. - Do you see what I mean? - Yes, Mr. Chairman. Stop! Stop! - Hi, big boy! - Hi. - All good? - Fine! - What now? - As usual. Naughty boy! Let's go. Recently, music productions haven't been at their best, but this record seems better than the others... - We picked it for you. - What did you eat? I tested Happy Bow-Wow dog food. I don't feel well. Call that campaign off. If it's not good for him, it's not for dogs either. What's going on? Did he faint? What's happening? - More testing. - Still? Make some space! Watch out! He'll handle it. Too late! All right, girls. Let's dispatch the mail. And me? Hello, madam. Hello! What a change! Let me see. - You look great! - Well... - Is it the cosmetics? - No, it's love. I love Jolin, Mr. Gerber. Really? Who put this stupid toy on my desk? - Does he know? - I didn't dare tell him. I was actually counting on you. You are such a resourceful man. - I'll handle it. - Really? Present for you. - You're so kind. - It's nothing. - Goodbye. - Bye. Shit, it's sticky! You should be cautious. It was probably meant for you. Or you. People know you're a fan of clackers. Then even moreso. You need me. Is this one of your projects? Yes, and it'll blow your mind away too. Gentlemen! Here's the new program, starting Monday. What we've done so far, is nothing compared to what we'll do. More precisely... I'm getting there. One thing though... Don't tell anyone. - Anyone, is that clear? - Yes. I read it very carefully. Did you really plan to do it? It would have been fun, no? Revolution is about taking over the power, not destroying it. I don't care about power. That's a child's response. Nowadays, one needs to be efficient. There is no room for dreamers or cheap gurus. You thought you were a modern-times Jesus, but not anyone can be a messiah. Bear in mind Jesus died on the cross. If you had died like him, like a glorious martyr, I would have insured you a great posthumous future. I would have had your bust set in our radio station's hall, unveiled in presence of ministers and archbishops. I would have delivered a very favorable speech, but you renounced to the logic of your destiny. It's awkward and unfortunate. Too bad. My destiny was in those clackers. "Was." And which one of my apostles did you pick? The one who brought this and will take over from you. Shall we bet? - You have 30 seconds. - That's 29 too many. It's my best friend, my brother, the brave Jolin. - How did you guess? - Logic of destiny. Every Jesus has its Judas. I see. Your end won't be as grand as the Christ's one, but far more interesting. I wrote you a check. A big one. And believe me, it won't bounce. Go spread your word far away from here. Tomorrow, Jolin will take your seat. He's a prick, I admit, but a laudable one. Thanks to him, RadioPlus will start afresh, and I'll get my money back. 'Cause you put me in trouble.' My company's shares all went down. The bank's trying to buy them out from me, but the game isn't over. If I hold out until Monday, I'll receive fresh money. What a bunch of idiots! They think I'll sell. Me? They don't know me. Hello, Mr. Chairman? It's Laubier. The shares lost 2 points. We need to decide now. Should we hold out or sell? Sell. - Thank you. - Good luck. To you too. I was waiting for you. - Why? - I'm leaving with you. The game is over. You're a free man. Me? No, I'll never be a free man. Go home. He's going to need you, now more than ever. "It's tough, isn't it? - "I said it's tough. - Yeah. "Isn't it?" It's very tough. Everybody he is nice, Everybody he is beautiful When cobblestones hit the sky Like superb grey birds When they smash cops' faces Who look surprised When street riots play out When we hear everywhere The sound of cops' clubs Hit clever minds In the mildness of the night The sky is my shelter And I think about Jesus Jesus, who said Everybody he is nice, Everybody he is beautiful The world is nice The world is beautiful In the quiet sky High above the roofs The plane drops napalm On the Indochinese people When hunger is raging And food is scare The fire from bombs and mines Cook the little children In the mildness of the night I feel so moved When I think about Jesus Jesus, who said Everybody he is nice, Everybody he is beautiful The world is nice, The world is beautiful Like in Jordan, Like the poor fedayee Lacks expertise And acts like Mr. Jourdain When the mercenary Is obsessed with peace And quenches his thirst With a fresh beer In the mild night I rely on prayer And I think about Jesus Jesus, who said Everybody he is nice, Everybody he is beautiful The movie is beautiful The movie is finished
