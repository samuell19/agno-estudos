Fuck you! Fuck yourself! Son of a bitch! I said I don't do that, you fat pig! Very sorry. It's not a habit of ours. Are you kidding me? This is a respectable hotel. If I see you again, I'll call the cops, OK? Why do I pay you, again? He wrecked my face, motherfucker. - I was... - Not outside the door. You have to be. Done this before? Do I have something there? No. As soon as I saw his Breitling Avenger. If you've got class, you don't get a watch like that. I'm bleeding. Well, it's... Are you dumb? You speak in consonants. They lumbered me with a deaf-mute. It's swollen. It's swollen. No shit, it's swollen. Like Nicole Kidman. Fuck... Fuck, it's not classy. You need to put ice on it. Eh? You need to put ice on it. Did it have to be fish fingers? They were out of peas. It's fuckin' dripping. Has it gone down? Leave it, never mind. Show me. I'm disfigured and I stink of fish. Don't move a muscle. Can't blame him not wanting my face. Crap night. I'd have made more on webcam. - Did he call? - What? My phone, did it ring? Serge? Serge didn't call? - I don't know. - I'm a social worker now. Great! Come on. We're going back. You're done. Thanks for everything. It was tops. How does it work? See this? That did it. Did you hit a deer? You do it on purpose. You let clients disfigure me, you arrive in this shit heap... Trying to ruin my business? - I need an advance. - Eh? Please. How much? 2,000. You think I'm an ATM? Are you a druggie? I told Franky, no junkies. You owe dosh? Next time, I want a pro. I don't need you. And it's a place for sophisticated people. CEOs, bankers, famous people. - And me? - What about you? - What do I do? - I don't know. Go to the drycleaners on Midi Street. They're open 24 hours. Pick this up for me. Then wait for me in the foyer. Look respectable. Excuse me. Are you with her? You're...? You do...? - You manage her? - Just the driver. "Just the driver." Don't worry, I'm not a cop. The reason I ask, I'm strapped for cash. But if I had 50 bucks for a whore, I'd be off. Seen that awesome arse on her? Have you had some? - Excuse me. - I'm coming, Madam. Tell her about me. Tell her about me. Now, let's have a look. It's nice. They did a good job. Those Chinese work. It all came off. Serge will be happy. He likes lady-like things. He's taking me out to dinner. A chic place like this. - What's his problem? - I don't know. I think he likes you. He likes me. Great. He couldn't afford me. He likes you a lot. Really? Did you tell him I wasn't free? Is Serge a regular? Are you thick or what? Serge is nothing like that. What is he? No, Serge is different. Jerk. Am I getting fat or what? It's nice, eh? Who do you owe the dosh to? Some guys I work for. Why? They paid my bail. I gotta pay them back. Is it a lot? 30,000. What did you do for 30,000? Assault and battery... aggravated. No one pays 30,000 for assault and battery. No, that's not all. They took care of everything. They forged payslips. That's a discount. "A discount", my arse. They're conning you. I can ask Serge, if you want. - Serge? - Yes, Serge. He's got influence. He's a politician. At least, he's a... civil servant... He's in local government. He could get you a gig at the council. What can you do? In any case, for me, he put my dosh on the stock market. It's growing big time, he said. I'll show you. Look. Here, when the curves are high, you're good. When Nasdaq's high... you're chill, it's going well. You're chill. Does he owe you much? Were you listening? He's earning me dosh, it's growing like mad. You need a job that's not too... You're manual. You're off tomorrow. I'll ask Serge for you. Keep it quiet. I'll take care of it. - Yes? - Hello, Serge. Where were you? I waited. Axelle, what the fuck? I told you before, don't come here. Hello? Hello? Stop! What a stupid fool! What? He said he was leaving his wife. And I believed him. A whore gets sucked in by her client. That's so original. That's great. Fuck... I don't care. Motherfucker. He can keep his wife. Don't touch me. Stay where you are. What do you want? Julien, Christelle. - Christelle, this is Julien. - Hi! Serge texted me. Say hello. Hi. He'll be trouble, I can tell you. Find another guy. He says three words a night, max. And he's broke. Christelle was asking questions. Really? What about? Are you hooked up? Are you seeing someone? I don't know why, but she likes you. Let's dance. Come. Come on! What are you doing? - Do I take you back? What? - Calm down. I don't want to dance. I don't want to... - I don't dance. - That's fine. Don't dance. I've got someone. I don't want... to screw it up. I don't want to. It's complicated. Right. Yeah, but you don't say anything. Are you separated? - You're separated? - I don't want to talk. I'm not talking. Let's go back. Come on. It's alright. Christelle's half loony. She was in a psych ward. Serge said he's taking me to Thailand. To the water festival. In a small village called Songkran. It's on 15 April. But it depends. According to the lunar cycle. People throw glasses of water. To mark the occasion. Mark what occasion? I told you, the New Year for Buddhists. It's 30 degrees all year. So, they're hot. It's the water festival. It sounds great. Songkran. "Songkran." "Songkran", with a G. - Fuck... - She's a pain. Have you ever killed anyone? No, don't answer that. Sometimes, I want to hurt someone. But then I think, they have families. It's hard. Serge wants kids. You want kids with your...? I've already got one. No. Stop, you're kidding me? Are you kidding or not? What's her name? Her name's Rose. She lives with her mother in Dunkirk. It's hard. Hope she takes after her mother. I didn't mean it! I was joking! Put me down! So, you're taking nights off? The man needs a holiday. What do we pay you for? For pleasure trips with whores? Little evenings off? I had an emergency. What? I had an emergency. You remind me of my son when he's fibbing. You know he's lying, but he keeps trying to convince you. You think we're idiots? I'll pay you. Of course you'll pay us, you've got till 4 pm. Or we'll slash you, you and your wee whore. Is your daughter still in France? Up in the north, there? Next time, it won't be your car that we hurt. Put that on it. - Fuck, it's gone to voicemail. - Forget it. Do you listen when I talk or not? We know Van Zuylen. He's at parties with us. Sicko. He's in Serge's sector, construction. He was on TV recently, about those collapsing houses. Serge knows him. If I ask him, he can get you out of this shit. You're welcome. Don't thank me. Hello? I'm here to see a friend but she's not answering. - Which floor? - Third right. There's no third floor. Douchebag. You try! You can't speak, do something! What's the use? What do you mean? You're kidding? I'm doing this for you. You think it's fun for me, with my problems? At least do it for that. - It's no use. - What does that mean? I'll handle it. But I have to hurry. How? Van Zuylen's fucking you over 30,000. Can't you see he doesn't care? Don't you get it? He's just messing with you, he's not into you? - He doesn't care. - Fuck you! Stop! Let me go! Shall I call the police? Shut your mouth! Yes? Fedex. - What are you doing? - You don't answer her. - Sorry? - When Axelle calls. Presses the buzzer... Shit. You're her pimp, is that it? That whore is crazy. There's my family, neighbours... This isn't her district. - She said that... - That what? - That you are... - What? In love. What kind of joke is this? "In love", this is unbelievable. Give her this. And this. Get rid of her. I told her. What does she want? I need a favour. Call Van Zuylen about the money I owe him. I talk to him, you get rid of the nut. - And the text? - What? The text about Thailand. Listen up, Forrest Gump, my wife and kids will be here in 10 minutes. The whore can go to hell. I told her about Thailand because I like to fuck romantics. I want stars in their eyes. Thailand works like a dream. I don't want to see you or her again. Off you go. What do I say to Van Zuylen? I'll say whatever you want. Thailand PURE BODIES
