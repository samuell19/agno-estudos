[man] Don'’t be scared. [flames roaring] [rumbling and shuddering] [gasps] [roaring, engines straining] [beeping] [roaring] [shuddering, engines straining] [roaring, engines straining] [shuddering, chute whooshes] [wind blusters] [impact thuds, groaning] [water splashes] [metal groaning] [water lapping] [gasps] [gasps] [muffled groans] [air whooshes] [gasps] [thunder rumbles] [lightning crashes] [gasps for air] [coughing and gasping] [straining] Hey? [straining] [panting] [chute flapping] Tucker? Tucker? Tucker? [gasps, muffled breaths] [gasping] Breathe. Just breathe. [muffled groans] It'’s clean. Radiation? No, no radiation. [relieved sigh] [bleeping] No neurological damage. Where'’s Holden? She crossed over. That puts you in command. -We need to report. -Yes. How long until the tide comes back? Six hours and 45 minutes. Okay. We'’ll use that time to gather data. I want to report results by then. Let'’s gear up. Aagh! I'’m gonna do the first recon on my own. [ethereal music] [Tucker] Blake. Can you hear me? -First recon underway at 8:17. -Copy. Agh! [sighs deeply] What'’s it like out there? Still flat. We should go into detail. Whatcha got? Are you seeing this? Confirming biogeochemical recycling. This exceeds the model'’s predictions. Can you classify? Chelicerata. Clearly a reproductive. I'’m guessing internal fertilisation. We should test. It'’s too soon. We'’ve been away from Kepler's radiation for 563 days. It'’s worth a shot. Run the biometer. That'’s an order. Erythrocyte count is normal range. -Yeah, haemoglobin'’s the same. -Minor reduction in leukocytes. Well, that'’s a good sign, right? Negative. Hey, Blake. At least it'’s a prospect. Moving on. Blake? I'’m tracking some weather. I'’m getting a high humidity reading. The patterns are changing real fast. Copy. What are they? Ah... Aurelia aurita. They reproduce both sexually and asexually. Aagh! -What happened? -It stung me. Your vitals are fine. They have these barbs on their tentacles. Maybe I should'’ve warned you about that. Thank you. Blake, the weather'’s getting worse. It'’s probably a storm coming in. Let'’s send what we'’ve got so far. [bleeping] Our next communication window is in four hours and five minutes. Copy. [wind blusters] I lost visibility. You better come back to base. I'’ll shoot you a flare. [groans] Uhh! [groans] [flare pops and whooshes] Got it. Coming in. [straining] [panting] -That was quick. -What was? -You. -But I'’m still two clicks away. [rattling] Tucker? Tucker, do you copy? [panting] Blake, go again. -What'’s going on? -I don'’t know. [skidding noises, thudding] [ship creaking] [loud rumbling] [skidding noises, loud thudding] [screaming] -Tucker? -Aagh! [tense music] [panting] [Tucker] Help! Blake! Help! [indistinct distant voices] [indistinct distant voices] [indistinct distant voices] [indistinct distant voices] [heavy breathing] [running footsteps] [blow thuds] [panting] Uhh! -[yells] -[water splashes] [gasps] [laughter from above] [water sloshing] -What happened? -They came out of nowhere. [man shouting] [man and woman speaking unknown language] Survivors? Mmm. I'’m going to get you the meds. [straining] [straining] [people speaking unknown language] -Hey! -[boy] Agi! My colleague needs medical help! -Uhh! Aagh! -[water splashes] I saw a child, Tucker. A child. [rattling above] Keep pressure on it. [man shouts] -[man] Enugoro! Ordu! -[yells] [injured man groans] [man] Kumit. Kick na ooke. Hilfen. [injured man groans] [man] Hilfen. Hilfoken. [panting] I need my medical equipment. -Do you understand me? -Mayi ye nel ye. [woman] Narvik! [Narvik] Where is it? Where is it? In the pod. Uhh! Aagh! Mish griev. [thunder rumbles] Men ai nochte zere. [groans] Then hold him still. [man pants] Aagh! Aagh! Aagh! -Aagh! Aagh! Aagh! -I said keep him still! Tucker? -Tucker. -Blake. A whole community. I saw babies. Babies, Tucker! -We have to let Kepler know. -How? They destroyed the pod, the panel, everything. But I spotted the biometer. We'’ll just have to gain their trust. Maybe we can find the Ulysses 1. -I'’ve lost too much blood. -You don'’t have to do this. I'’ll only slow you down. Base orders. If we pose a threat to the mission, we have... No, you'’re my fertility match. 87%, remember? Without transmission... none of this even matters. Go. Get the biometer. Find the Ulysses 1. Maybe he'’s still alive. For the many. [crunches] [shudders] [man] I have something for you. I'’m gonna give you one. And I'’m gonna take this one for me. My father got them from his father. [child] What is it? Don'’t be scared. Every time the second moon passes Cygnus, you light a match. And wherever I am-- In a ship or on a planet far, far away-- I'’ll do the same. And before the last one'’s gone... we'’ll be together again. I promise. Daddy, please don'’t leave me. What does Kepler teach us, Louise? We will not think about ourselves. We will not let our emotions guide us. We do this for the many. -Please. -For the many, Louise. I don'’t want to be here without you. -Say it, for the many. -For the many. Again, why do we do it? -For the many. -Yes, say it, for the many. That'’s why we do it, for the many. Good. [Blake whispers] For the many. For the many. For the many. For the many. For the many. For the many. For the many. For the many. [water ripples] [water rushes] [water floods] Uhh! Hey! Help! [gasping] Help! Uhh! Help me! [tense music] [poignant music] [indistinct chatter and children'’s laughter] [indistinct chatter, baby cries] [man] She was called Mother Earth. It'’s close enough to the sun to have water, air and fire. There used to be tropical jungles and mighty forests breathing oxygen for us. And we couldn'’t stay? No, we plundered everything she offered. Now, you see, we can take this... That'’s it. This is the seedling of a plant called "tree." Will they ever grow? No, not here. Maybe I should take them with me, what do you think? You had a signal? Yeah. I did. We left all these weather stations around the globe. And to our surprise, we got some data from one of the weather stations right here. This one. It'’s called the "Henderson Hub." It seems like there'’s a new area of regeneration. Of course, it'’s miles away from any former human civilization, but that'’s a good thing. Because humans basically spoiled the rest of the Earth. Listen, if... if what we find promises to be true and it'’s safe... I'’ll send for you, all right? You promise? -I promise. -[computer] Five, four... three, two... one, ignition! [engines roar, panting] [poignant music] [engines roaring] [people chanting] For the many. For the many. For the many. For the many. For the many. For the many. -For the many. For the many. -For the many. For the many. -For the many. -For the many. For the many. [indistinct voices] Back in grot. Hey! I'’m thirsty! I need water! -[man talking] -[child] Yas di iey iech? [laughter] Where did you get this? [laughter] Hey. Can you get that... that red case? The boy has it. Can you get it from him? No, the red case. Do you understand what I'’m saying? Wien ar vu? Wien... ar... vu? -Oh, where am I from? -Frams eiland? Earth. Aarda? Yes. And very far away from here, there is another planet, Kepler 209. Aarda? Wai kira? Why we came to Earth? People... I mean, there are no babies anymore. No kinders? Maila. I'’m Blake. Okay, Maila... if you could find this thing for me. Can you bring it to me? [rattling above] [screaming, men shouting] [baby crying] Shh! [baby crying] [gunshots above] [shouting and screaming] [gunshots and screaming continue] [children screaming] -[man shouting] -[Maila shouts] Laat me! [man] Huej! [Maila shouts] Laat me! Laat me! [Maila screams] [screaming continues, men shouting] [daunting music] [all gasping] [baby splutters and coughs] [baby crying softly] [baby quietens] Shh, shh, shh. [baby gurgles] Maila? [panting] [baby cries] Maila! Maila? [girl nearby] Mama! Mama! [girl sobs] Mama! [girl sobs] Mama! Mama? [baby cries] [girl] Narvik. Wier jir gan? Umsoyak hur hahr. Eiker cum kjeareah. [poignant music] [wind blusters] Who were those people? Who were they? [panting] Maila, she... she'’s your sister? Daughter. Where'’s her father? Flood took him. Why are you following me? I wanna help you. You just want your stuff back! [child screams] Nje, nje! Maila. [tense music] [man shouts, child screams] [child shouting] -[man shouting] -[child] Nje, nje! Maila. [Maila screams] -What are you doing? -They'’re leaving. -That'’s just a flare gun. -If they leave, she'’s gone! Listen to me! Shoot in the air. -Shoot in the air. -What? They'’ll be distracted, while we free her. Trust me! Give it to me! -Narvik! -Ah! [boat'’s engine starts] [man] Huej! Weasmea! [men speaking indistinctly] [boat'’s engine rumbles] [boat'’s engine stops] [waves lapping] [man] Oy, wegladea! Oy. -Jea. -Joa sortan wealech. [men talking indistinctly] [man shouts] [boat creaking] [indistinct voices, coughing] [boat creaking] [boat'’s engine starts] [boat'’s engine rumbling] [waves thudding] [large wave thuds] [whispered voices] [men shouting above] [man] Wa je skear je. [man shouts] -[water splashes] -[man] Huej! Heuj! Heuj! [men shouting] [child] Nje! [man] Joa komm me! -[people screaming] -[woman] Kaaam! Kaaam! [daunting music] [man shouting orders] Kaaam! [man shouting] [man] Paling! Werk. Werk. Skirra! Far hahr oop. Til Kumin avic me. Blake! Where hedoen vous veined deehea? Vjimay yiz deehea? Vjimay yiz deehea? Stop. Take off your cape. Take it off. Hands up. Hands up! Mind your head. Wait here. You'’re not from here. Are you an astronaut? She is. I can'’t believe it. Welcome! We'’ve waited so long. I'’m Gibson. Louise Blake, sir. Louise? [laughs] My God, I remember you. You were... his size the last time I saw you. Well, I'’m sorry you didn't receive a warmer welcome. What happened to your crew? They crossed. We had a malfunction after entering the stratosphere. Have you communicated with Kepler? No, the people we encountered damaged the pod. Well, the people here, they'’re... hot-headed. But we still have the biometer. We developed it on Kepler to measure biochemical changes. It'’s specialized in fertility. Your men took it. It must be here somewhere. Can it transmit? Not by itself. I figured I could connect it to the Ulysses 1'’s transmitters. I'’m afraid the Ulysses 1 was completely destroyed. And my father? [Gibson] The people of Kepler owe him a huge debt. What happened? Shortly after sending our last status report, we encountered the survivors - "Muds," we called them. We were stunned these people had survived. Your father, in particular, was very good with them. And then, we were waiting for the next communication window to send our report to trigger the Kepler homecoming. But they rebelled, erupted in violence, destroyed everything including the Ulysses 1, our only means of communication. It was... mystifying, after we offered them so much. Stafford was killed that day. And so was your father. It'’s so dangerous here, we've been forced to arm ourselves. We found weapons in one of the abandoned ships. But we'’re running out of arsenal. Daddy? Can I give her a present? Come. It'’s a Space Shuttle. I had a bit of trouble with the nose cone. Very nice, Neil, but off you go now, with your mother. He'’s excited you came. Is he your son? I adopted him. What'’s the situation on Kepler? Much worse. All reproductive technology efforts failed for both men and women. Well... it'’s imperative now that we bring our people and realise your father'’s vision. How do we handle Kepler'’s arrival? Tide waters, mudflats, unstable sediment make it extremely complex. [wind blusters] A dam across the mouth of the estuary. This way, we'’ll finally hold back the sea. But the rebellion set back our progress. Almost all the work had to stop. Are those turbines? Your father realized, the tides might provide a source of-- Hydro electricity. He knew the constant ebb and flow of the water could power a whole community. It'’s not just for us. Have you noticed how hardly any of the Muds is older than 30? It'’s the conditions they live under. Twice a day, stricken by mist and tide. We have to take care of future generations. Give them the... the chance of civilization. Sir? Cabin is ready. The shower works, but the water'’s a bit cloudy. Right, I'’ll leave you for the night. Gibson. Thank you. I'’m so pleased that you'’re here with us now. [shudders] [whispers] For the many. For the many. For the many. Carbon dioxide... oxygen... water vapour? Very good. And? -Nitrogen? -Nitrogen. Very good. See that orange glow is made out of tiny atoms of carbon. Can you imagine that moment... when humans first discovered fire? Suddenly, we could control the elements. [gasps] [breathes heavily] [poignant music] [door opens] I brought you some fresh clothes. Thank you. [indistinct chatter] Children. [children muttering] We have an incredibly special visitor today. [laughs] Shh, shh, shh. Children, this is Louise Blake. Would you like to say something? -[all] Welcome, Miss Blake! -Very good. We will perform what we'’ve learnt. Stand up. They'’ve waited a long time to perform for a Kepler. And... [children singing] ♪ We were lost, alone in space ♪ So far from home In airless waste ♪ ♪ Alone within Our star-filled dome ♪ ♪ No countryside In which to roam ♪ ♪ We endured That we may endure ♪ ♪ To make our destiny secure ♪ To find a land of hope And plenty ♪ ♪ For the many, for the many [claps] Well done, children. Sit down now. Do you mind if they ask you a few questions? -[Blake] No, of course. -Come on, sit. -[Gibson] Any questions? -Sir! -Mr Gibson! -Damek. Can you swim on Kepler? We have simulation pools, but there'’s no lake or oceans. -Do you like it here? -Yes. I like it here. I mean, it'’s a bit wet sometimes, but... [laughter] Remember, on Kepler, it'’s dry, and it'’s arid, very rocky, so when you go outside, you need to wear a respirator, and people live inside these huge... -Biodomes. -Well done, Lexi! Very good. Any more questions? Do you miss home? Well, actually, I'’m hoping that this could become my home. Any more questions? [all pleading] No, that'’s... that's enough, that'’s enough, I think. What do you want to say, children? [children] Thank you, Miss Blake! Why aren'’t you at school? I get private lessons. Are you good at maths? Test me. What'’s 83 times 76? 6,308. What'’s 67 times 54? 3618. Do you want to know a secret? [whispers] It'’s called a "tree." Do you know, they used to be as big as me... and everywhere? Imagine. -Who taught you this? -What? The tree. Christopher Columbus. He lives in a cabin next to the engine room. I talk to him through the pipes. Show me. I'’m not allowed to go there. [tense music] [door slams] [water dripping] [Gibson] I'’m sorry I lied to you. Why is he in there? -Give me a chance to explain. -Just tell me why? The rebellion I told you about. It wasn'’t the Muds who led it, it was your father. -You'’re lying. -No, Blake. Why would he do that? He fell in love... with a Mud woman. Forgot whose side he was on, I guess. Open the door. Papa. Louise. Oh, Louise. [father] I missed you so much. Louise... I'’m sorry. Papa. [Blake] Is it true? You betrayed us? Fifteen years I waited to hear from you. I did everything to be sent on this mission, just to know what had happened to you. And you gave up on me? I did. You gave up on Kepler? Why? I had to stop it. Stop what? The mistakes. I don'’t understand. Can'’t you see what'’s going on here? Kepler shouldn'’t come back, Louise. None of us should have come back. Louise! [wind blusters] He ruined everything we'’d worked so hard to achieve. But in the end, nothing changes the fact he'’s from Kepler. That'’s the Henderson Hub? They wanted to destroy that too. But we stopped them. I'’ll transmit from there. It'’s just a weather station. But it'’s intact, right? I could connect the biometer to it. And send what? Kepler wants proof that we could procreate here. It looks like my TSH levels have recovered. We'’ll find the biometer. I'’ll send Paling now. Our predecessors failed us in so many ways, but this was one of their greatest inventions. -For the many. -For the many. Again! -Soup! -Neil. Dyen korse. I'’m still learning their language. The vocabulary is remarkable. They have... 13 different words for water. Fourteen, Daddy. It depends on what it does. Saltwater. Drinking water. -Floodwater... -You know what, Neil? You should be our interpreter when they come. I don'’t want to be an interpreter. I want to be an astronaut, saving people'’s lives. You'’re thinking of a superhero, not an astronaut. He found some old comics. But you saved my life. Your favorite story, isn'’t it? Munay, why don'’t you tell it to Blake? When I delivered Neil... his... "Naelsnora"? Umbilical cord. It was wrapped around his neck. Out there, in the ocean, both Neil and I would be dead now. This man saved our life. He cut my stomach open, got the baby out, treated my wounds. And then he made us into his family. Dramatic way to start a family. -Fish balls! -Neil... No, Neil! Use a knife and fork. You'’re a civilized human being, for God'’s sake. Ah, don'’t worry, it'’s just a blackout. Happens from time to time. [footsteps approaching, man shouting] Sir, we were looking for the biometer when there has been an intrusion. Someone took out the guards by the generators and killed the power. Secure this floor. Have all guards check every entrance. Yes, sir. You take Neil and lock yourself in. [Neil] Mummy. -I'’ll check the corridors. -You'’re safest in your room. -[loads gun] -That'’s an order. [running footsteps, men shouting] Maila, where is she? Where is she? Take me to her! All right. Okay. [tense music] Maila? Huej! Naskiratsi tsi strap pissot! -Huej! -Maila! Ma! Ma! [guard strains] Mama! -Uhh! Aaagh! -Mama! Lemnach ma Mama ensama! [Paling] What the fuck is going on here? Enough! [Maila] Ma! [panting] -[she whimpers] -Narvik! -[Blake] Stop! -[Maila] Mama! Stop it! You stop it! [Maila] Mama! What did you say? [Narvik whimpers] Take this thing away. Lemnach ma Mama ensama! Lemnach ma Mama ensama! [Narvik whimpers] They only take the girls. [Narvik whimpers] [Maila] Mama. Mama! Mama! [Paling] Are you okay? You will be fine. -What will happen to her? -Shh. Better for you not talking. You have his eyes. [Gibson] How'’s the throat? I'’ll survive. I'’m sorry you got caught up in all this. Narvik has quite a temper. You know her name? She was one of the guards who turned against us. They hate us. She just wanted her daughter. She'’s a Kepler daughter now. Why only girls? Let me ask you this. What'’s the average age of our females back home? Maybe late, mid-40s? Assuming they leave now, most of them will be in their 50s by the time they arrive. Do the maths, Blake. Even if their fertility is restored, it'’ll be too late for most of them to conceive. We need a diverse and vigorous gene pool. They are children. They won'’t be by the time our people arrive. So is this our mission? To ensure we don'’t die out? Absolutely. In case you didn'’t notice, Gibson, the human race doesn'’t actually need us to survive. You sound just like your father. They'’re not like us. We can repopulate our planet. Our current predicament calls for a measure of expediency. If you have an alternative, please enlighten me. [door opens, footsteps] Paling. It was on the tugboat. Thank you. Now Paling is a perfect example of a Mud who worked out what'’s best for him. Where is it? -Where is it? -It must be back at the camp. -Daddy, Daddy! -Shut up! When the tide comes in, you and Paling, you'’re gonna go back there and find the damn thing. And Narvik? She'’ll be executed at dawn. Are you still with us, Blake? Yes, sir. Keep an eye on her. What'’s that? [gentle sobbing] -Hey. -[sobbing] What are you doing here? Blake! [Maila sobs gently] Listen to me. We'’re gonna find your mother. Ma? Yes, Ma. -[knocking] -[Paling] Open the door! [whispers] It'’s all right, just wait here. Stay there. [knocking] Captain'’s order, open! [knocking] I have to search your cabin. One of the girls is missing. I'’m curious. What was it like being on Kepler... with no one? Must make a woman hungry... to feel life inside. Have a seat. Come. [both groaning] [Blake] Aagh! [Maila whimpers] Paling! [pill crunches] [splutters and groans] Uhh! [coughs and splutters] Let'’s go. Varidi es hou heir? Con vous yjelp mezure fjyend dai tochlett? Vous net hier! No vous fier! No vous-- [door opening] [whispering voices] Ma! Maila! Come! [child] Mama? Mama? Let'’s get out of here. Louise. What'’s going on here? Come and see this. Why are they going there? Gibson never leaves the ship. Never. How did you get this? It'’s Neil. He sends me surprises. It was in there all the time. What? What was? The biometer. They want the proof that we can procreate here. But there'’s none on there. No. No! He has the proof. He has it with him. -What do you mean? What proof? -Neil is the proof. Neil is a Kepler. Whatever Gibson told you, it'’s a lie. We have to stop him. You have to stop him. Louise. Louise? I never lit the last one. [men shouting in the distance] [men shouting] [men shouting] [screams] Come! [men shouting] [tense music] [panting] [man shouts] [gunfire] Come! [Blake] Go! [woman screams] [gunfire] [woman screams] Run! [screams] [child whimpers] [tense music] Stop it! -[Munay] No, please! -[Gibson] Drop the gun! -[Munay] Please! -He'’s your own flesh and blood. [Munay] Please! -Tell her! -It'’s true, he's your brother. Drop the gun. -You don'’t think I'll do it? -No! No, please, Gibson! No! No! [Neil] Mama! Drop the gun! Drop it! Mama! No, Mama! Mama! It'’s sent! [screams] Wake up! Ah! Wake up! [gasps] [coughs and splutters] Blake. [boat engine starts] [people talking indistinctly] Go to him, Louise. He trusts you. Hey... Can I sit down? My father got this from his father. He told me it must be handled with care. Now it'’s yours. He must have named you after one of them. Are they coming? Maybe. How many? All of them. Will they bring some trees? Possibly. [poignant music] [indistinct chatter and laughter] [ethereal music]
