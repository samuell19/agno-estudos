This is Africa... ...it's 1838... Courageous and brave men, adventured into the mysterious... ...Black Continent to discover their secrets and treasures. They didn't care about dangers of the forest... ...they faced to the fierce and the unknown... ...and kept the civilization away... ...in order to find legendaries King Solomon's Mines... ...or Elephant's Cemetery that guarded a fortune in ivory. Some of them went back ills, weaken and defeated... ...others continued their adventure... ...and without notice, they arrived to the Black Forest... ...this is territory of a dangerous... ...fierce and bloodstone tribe known as "The Plant Men". Faith was fulfilled. Those brave expeditionary who looked for glory... ...found death. KING OF THE GORILLAS The only survivor... ...was at mercy of the jungle. Only a miracle could save him. To what terrible and strange world had he arrived? Where were the dearest and familiar face... ...of his mother? Who were that hairy and fierce creature... ...that had rescued from the canoe? He only could feel fear and mistrust. He ignored that he owned his life to those... ...savage animals. Thanks to these apes he was still alive. From now he will belong to the big ape's species. He will grow up among them... ...and his story will be a legend. Kyra became his protector. Kyra, was a wild gorilla, but inside of her... ...she had a sweet heart. She will be his mother. The little kid will be protected by her... ...and the other apes. His name. That name who civilized people give him... ...will be lost forever in this savage world. From now he'll be Ape. The little White Ape. And Ape grown up. It passed twelve years... ...that helpless creature who arrived to this jungle... ...is now a member of the big apes clan. However, human thoughts tortured him. He had a lot of doubts every time... ...he looked his face reflected in the water. Why was he different? Why was he skinny and ugly without any hair in his body? Why wasn't he beautiful and hairy like his brothers? Gosh! What an ugly nose he had! It wasn't wide and big like the other apes was. And his teeth, it was so little... ...beside the others. His eyes were so clear... ...horribly blues! Why? Why he was so different? Dead warrior's son was very sad. Poor Notoku! He had lost his father! The eldest of the tribe told him he must been proud... ...because his father had quit this world like a brave warrior. Holding his lance and faced to the powerful... ...king of the jungle. But nothing comforted the young cannibal. He had to revenge. He had to kill the lion. He was so young... But he didn't care! He'll show them that he could be a great warrior! Notoku decided to go that night. He told nothing to anyone. If they known about his plans... ...he won't let him go. But they will see! He wasn't a little kid anymore! He wasn't weak like a girl! He was a hunter! The best of all! He will return with lion's dead body! Armed to the teeth, with the Great Warriors Shield... ...he stolen a canoe and went by the river. He rowed and rowed, forgetting the most important lesson: A warrior must be aware all the time. Asleep... ...he was deeply asleep dreaming about glory. He dreamt about the great exploit... ...that became a respected member of his tribe. And while he was sleeping he rose the river up... ...and entered to the deepest part of the forest... ...where the big apes lived. What a surprise! He had found a creature... ...who was exactly like him. But he was uglier than him. What fright they took! Ape ran to the forest. Notoku, trembling and excited, took their weapons... ...ready to fight against him. Notoku wished that the people of his tribe looked him now! He was in the forest, ready to hunt... ...that strange hairless ape! Ape observed his rival... ...and he didn't have any doubt... That strange ape didn't have good intentions. The best thing to do was run away... Ape suspected that he could be Notoku's supper. Notoku didn't expect to find that enormous and fierce gorilla. So, forgetting his ambitions of being a great hunter... ...he ran away scared and full of dread. All the jungle was mocking of him! Fortunately, no one of his tribe was watching to him... ...or his prestige as a hunter... ...was in very bad shape. Notoku's awake was not very pleasant. He was surrounded by all that apes... ...who had stolen everything, even his clothes. But at that moment, who cared about those little details? The most important thing to do now was... ...to save his skin. So, he ran... ...and ran like a deer. Unfortunately, in his desperate career... ...Notoku found face to face to his terrible enemy... ...the powerful lion. How he could to face him? It wasn't a good time, because he was naked and unarmed. He'll tell to the tribe his great adventure... ...if he would come through with flying wings. Will he do it? Ape was so proud and happy. Notoku was uglier and clumsy than him. Notoku smiled with relief. At that moment, a friendship was born... ...between ape's son and the cannibal. Ape realized that he had been wrong... ...respecting Notoku. He known a lot of things. He used those strange things to get food. No, he was not fool at all. But he won't be willing to share it. If Ape wanted to eat he'll have to use those weapons. Ape was very puzzled about the fire. How Notoku could control those flames... ...which he had seen to consume the entire jungle? Those flames were so hot! How Notoku used that fire? Without noticed, Ape was reaching... ...to civilization. Inside of him, in his conscience... ...he heard the shout of his inheritance... ...something was saying to him that to be close... ...to the fire was part of his human nature. Lion's bellow shook the jungle, and Notoku remembered... ...which was his mission in that jungle. Before to kill the lion, Notoku and his new friends... ...decided to confront the ostriches. If he hunted four or five, they would be ready to fight. They was so concentrated, that they didn't notice... ...that the greatest danger was at their back. Make warriors colors. When the courage was back, Ape, Notoku and Mongo... ...was ready to start the great hunting. Like great warriors had done, they painted their faces... ...in order to scare the lion. Then, everything will be simple. Notoku will run through with his arrow... ...and glory will be able to afford. But they were the surprised! The lion didn't be afraid with warrior's aspect. And he decided to attack those humans. That was a big fiasco! All his tribe will be ashamed of him! He was not a brave warrior! Poor Notoku! He was so demoralized... ...and defeated. He will be the laughingstock of the village. And his mother will give him a striking... ...because he went out without permission. But, suddenly he had a great idea! The one that would turn him into a hero. He'll take Ape to his village. To convince Ape to go was very easy. Then, for second time in his life... ...the little child went in a canoe... ...towards the unknown. Very sad, Mongo saw them to go away forever. Ape will know a primeval civilization. Ape looked how Notoku joined to his people. Those humans was so different to his beloved apes. The village was so happy to see Notoku alive! They thought he had died in the jungle! And he had brought a prey of his adventure! That white boy who stand in the canoe... ...so quiet and serious. Everybody ran towards Ape. He thought about his freedom. He remembered Mongo, Kyra... ...and all the apes, and he wanted to back with them. Notoku was in his world. Ape will return to his own! He got lost in the jungle forever. There was no trace of his friend. He will never see him again. Hereafter among warriors, and in the Elder Council... ...that strange being will become a legend... ...the legend of the White Ape. Years passed. The legend expanded... ...in the whole Back Continent until the civilized world. Scientist and expeditionary returned to look for... ...to hunt that strange being who lived in the deepest... ...part of the jungle, among the big apes. That being that nobody had seen... ...who could be the missing link... ...whom Charles Darwin referred in his theory. Overwrought... ...their supplies was almost out of stock... ...after weeks and weeks traveling through... ...the Black Continent, a scientific expedition... ...finally arrived to that lost village... ...that was the last contact with civilized world... ...after that point started the virgin jungle... ...it was unexplored and mysterious. Expeditionary felt defeated... ...Eva, scientist's daughter waiting next to him. He used to be the guide and now he was very sick. Impotent, Eva saw his father die. African jungle had a new victim. Alone in her bedroom... ...Eva took his father journal and started to read. "The trip had been so long. We had avoided... "...so many dangers. I'm worried about Eva. "I'm frightened that something could happen to her. "I know she has an indomitable spirit. I've been victim of tsetse fly... "...his poison is now in my organism. "I'll die soon. May God helps my dear daughter... "...and take her back to England safe and sound." Scientist's last words... ...encouraged the girl. Today we buried my father. I feel a great sadness... ...a deep vacuum... ...and also fear, because I'm still in this... ...uncivilized and inhospitable continent. At the beginning, I wanted to back... ...but now I think that I must continue... ...with this work in order to reach my father's goals. Ape was not that being helpless and eerie anymore. Those years passed in the jungle... ...had taught him to defend himself... ...and to survive. Expedition continued his quest... ...and without notice it they infringing... ...the laws of the jungle. That strange presence what agitated... ...animal world was the civilization. It arrived razed nature's balance... ...and it didn't stop before anything... ...or anybody. Our spirit was keeping up... ...we felt that we would discover very soon... ...the enigma that intrigued... ...scientist all over the world. We will prove that men descend from ape. After several days searching without find anything... ...tired of waiting any news, for the first time... ...I started to doubt... ...and I had the thought that all our efforts... ...had been in vain. Carriers didn't want to go on. Fritz, the guide, offered them more money. Since then, we had a strange feeling. We felt that someone was watching us... ...from the distance. Few days later, we found a trace... ...that filled me with enthusiasm. What we thought was the trace of the missing link... ...became a nightmare of death and horror. My awake was terrible. That horrible beast was staring at me. I realized he was the White Ape... ...and I discovered he was not the missing link... ...but just a human being. I noticed he was jealous. He had a defiant attitude... ...and confronted every creature who tried to reach me. He felt as my owner. At that moment, I just wanted to save my life... ...so I ran, tried to run away. Days passed, and the panic that I felt at the beginning... ...transformed into a great curiosity. What terrible destiny had carried... ...that poor soul to the forest? How could he have survived all those years? I learned more about human being while I was living... ...with that savage, than all my years... ...at the University. White Ape was good and curious... A savage with a boy's soul. Every time that I thought in the misery... ...and lonely life that Ape had lived... ...I felt pity for him. I don't know when I started to feel sweetness... ...and then... ...love. Some months later, we had a son. I never imagined I could live with... ...such peace and freedom in that jungle. I felt the happiest woman on earth... ...living with my husband and son. Yes. My world was complete. Once again, an expedition had arrived... ...at this part of the jungle... ...in order to capture all the animals. Attired by the legend, Captain Livingston... ...who traveled with his daughter Betty... ...wanted to capture that white being... ...who lived in the land of big apes. Once again, civilized man returned... ...to White Ape's domains. Anxious, I asked my son where he had found... ...that harmonica. His answer filled me with happiness. Civilized men were close to us. Finally we'll have the chance to go out of that... ...savage world where we had been living. But Ape didn't think the same. He mistrusted... I also doubt about it and I thought... ...that we should hide in the deepest part of the jungle. Where no one could ever find us. But I decided to receive them. I convinced my family to go with me. I believed that encounter will be marvelous. I thought it will be good to our lives. I'll convince them Ape was a human being. It was a mistake! A terrible mistake! All these years living in peace... ...made me to forget the meanness of man. Suddenly, my fear became in rage and defiance. I am a civilized woman and I won't allow this hunting! I decided to talk to them. Inside his primitive intelligence... Ape known to level things... ...and making feel to civilized man... ...the fear of the possibility of losing his daughter. Finally, we established a dialogue. When I saw Ape with the girl... ...I understood what he wanted to do. A barter. If Livingston let us go, Ape will release the girl. The civilized man accepted. Ape had won the battle. Those events that could finish... ...in a tragedy finally joined us. Those expeditionary stopped to be strangers... ...and possibly enemies, the love to our children... ...joined us and we became friends. When they established a dialogue... ...differences between them appeared. On one side, was Ape, at the other Livingston... ...and I was in the middle. The civilized man made the question. I was a woman who grown up in the civilization... ...will I let my son to live like a savage? Would it be better for him to go to England? He maybe was right. I told that to Ape. He won't let our son go. He mistrusted them. Finally, after some discussion, we decided to vote about it. We did that. My son and I won. He was very excited with the perspective... ...to know the civilized world. The discussion was over. Our son will go with expedition group.
