All right, Bob. >> Bob: Okay. >> Henry: What I can't understand is why a company this small needs a full-time janitor. You know the company would save so much money if we just hired a cleaning crew to do it [laughter]. >> Bob: You know it's because the owner's a real clean freak. He can't stand to be replaced. You might even see him cleaning a toilet or mopping a floor. I know it's a little strange [laughter]. You'll get used to it. We actually had a cleaning crew once but it wasn't good enough for him so we hired Isaac to do it full-time. >> Henry: I see. All right what I want to do now is I need to get together with the accountant and find out what exactly what was going on second quarter. These weeks in particular.

I'll get my things packed up and be out by close of business today. >> Isaac: Actually, hold on a second. You're not fired. >> Henry: Okay I'm listening. >> Isaac: I wanted to tell you that you haven't treated me too good. In fact, you treated me like dirt ever since you've been here. You need to learn how to respect others. >> Henry: I do have respect... >> Isaac: I'm not done yet. You don't deserve this but I'm going to let you stay employed here. But as the janitor. >> Henry: [Laughter] There's no way I'm doing that. >> Isaac: It's just for a month. >> Henry: Then what? >> Isaac: Then you can have your old job back. >> Henry: You know I can't afford to take a pay cut. >> Isaac: No pay cut.

Where have I seen you before? >> Chris: I used to be in the mailroom [laughter]. >> Henry: That's right. >> Isaac: Hello everyone. >> Chris: Hey Isaac. >> Hi. >> Isaac: The reason I wanted to call this meeting was to get to know everyone a little bit better. Ya'll know me as a janitor, but as my new position I want to be a little bit more hands on. See now my vision for the company is to take it to the next level. You know, make it a little bit more hip. I've seen the work we've done and I think we can do a little better. But first I want to introduce you all to Chris. >> Chris: Hi. I'm Chris. >> Hi. >> Hey Chris. >> Isaac: He's the new COO. [ Applause ] >> Now I want to go around the room and let each one of ya'll introduce yourselves and what you do. >> Stephanie: Hi I'm Stephanie and I'm the Director of Accounts Services. >> John: Hi I'm John.

What became of Henry the old COO? >> Isaac: You can say he's on a temporary assignment. >> John: What do you mean by temporary? >> Isaac: He's going to be the new janitor for about a month and then I may let him have his old job back. >> Chris: Oh, that means that I can have my old job back. >> Isaac: We going to talk later. So does anybody have any more questions? [ Silence ] Okay. Well it's nice meeting ya'll. >> Stephanie: You too. >> Isaac: Hey Chris, hold on a second. I need to talk to you. [ Shuffling ] >> Now in a month you'll still be the COO. You know, I'm going to get Henry back for all the times he treated us so bad. Remember that? >> Chris: Yeah. >> Isaac: I'm getting him back. I'm going to put him through it. Now when I get done with him he will quit. There's no way he's going to make it as a janitor for a month. >> Chris: You know, Isaac I'm going to be honest with you man. He's kind of a hardheaded guy. You realize that. Right? >> Isaac: Yeah but I am too. >> Chris: All right. Good luck with that. [ Typing and Knocking ] >> John: Hi, come in. What can I do for ya? >> Isaac: I was wondering if you could be my accountant on personal accounts. >> John: Sure. >> Isaac: The lottery people, they took half my money because I choose the lump sum option and they said I still have to pay taxes on it. >> j: Yeah. They government will definitely want their cut. >> Isaac: Well thanks for doing this. >> j: No problem. [ Noises ] [ Music ] >> Good boy. Good boy. >> [Background Music] [Inaudible]. >> Sure.

I wanted to go to that. >> Stephanie: Okay. >> Isaac: All right. Hey let me let you go. Yeah I got to go to a meeting. >> Chris: Hey Isaac, can I talk to you for a minute? >> Isaac: No I really need to go to this meeting. >> Chris: I understand. I just -- I wanted to let you know I really don't think this job's for me. I... >> Isaac: No. >> Chris: No I'm serious. >> Isaac: No, you good, you good. >> Chris: No, I... >> Isaac: Just stay here. Give it a chance. >> Chris: Don't gun me. Okay. >> Isaac: Oh, sorry I'm late [door closing]. >> Stephanie: It's all right. >> David: No problem. >> Stephanie: All right, so what I was saying was we really got to impress this client. I mean we have to wow them. Their last ad campaign just wasn't that great and this will decide if they stick with us or not. Okay. >> David: At ACME Insurance we got you covered. Health, Fire, Flood, Theft, and Car. Give us a call we've got it all. >> Stephanie: So keep it simple. That's what this client wants. Simple. Yeah? >> Isaac: I think it's a little too simple. It's missing something. >> Stephanie: Okay. What's it missing? >> Isaac: How about an animal. >> David: An animal? An animal has been so done. What commercial these days doesn't have an animal? >> Isaac: Okay. How about a fish? >> David: A fish? >> Stephanie: A fish? >> David: What would the fish do? >> Isaac: Okay follow me for a second. There's a fish in a bowl in a house. And the fish jumps out of the bowl onto the stove and it turns on a burner. But instead of the burner turning on it fill the whole house up with gas and then all of a sudden boom, the whole house explodes. Then you got the insurance [inaudible] saying, "No matter what happens we got ya covered." What'd ya think? >> Stephanie: Hmm-mm. I don't know. David what do you think? >> David: You're looking at significant expense for animation and a lot going on there. It could work. >> Isaac: I really think this could work. Can ya'll make this happen? >> David: You're the boss. >> Stephanie: Yeah. >> Isaac: All right. Thanks. >> Stephanie: All right. [ Noises ] [ Birds Chirping and Footsteps ] >> Ginger: I told you I'm already seeing somebody. >> Isaac: What are you talking about? >> Ginger: Get away from me. >> Isaac: You're crazy. >> Ginger: Isaac.

Sorry to hear that [laughter]. You okay? >> Isaac: Well actually I'm relieved. Around her I spend way too much money. >> Mike: Well since you back single again, might as well give Sheila another chance. >> Isaac: I don't think Sheila's interested in me. >> Mike: That's why she keeps asking about you every week at church? >> Isaac: Asking about me? >> Mike: Yup. You should just come back to church. >> Isaac: Yeah I do kind of miss it. >> Mike: Oh here it is. >> Isaac: Here it is. There it is. [ Commercial ] Can you believe I can up with all that myself? >> Mike: It's kind of violent and sad. >> Isaac: Really? >> Mike: Yeah, the fish died. [ Music ] Never thought about it like that. >> Mike: Other than that it was okay. >> Isaac: You think? >> Mike: Yeah. You got talent. >> Isaac: Thanks. [ Paper Crumpling ] >> Stephanie: Hey. >> Isaac: Hey. >> Stephanie: I got some bad news. >> Isaac: Okay. >> Stephanie: [Background Music] We lost the ACME insurance account. >> Isaac: What happened? >> Stephanie: They got too many complaints about the fish dying. >> Isaac: What? That's crazy. We know the fish really didn't die. >> Stephanie: I know that but a lot of people just didn't realize that. >> Isaac: Okay so how big of clients were they? >> Stephanie: The largest we had. >> Isaac: What? >> Stephanie: But luckily they were a new client. We still have all of our other ones to fall back on. >> Isaac: Okay well, I'm sorry. >> Stephanie: You don't have to apologize. It's just the way the business is. It's hit or miss. The next ad campaign could be great. We do this all the time. It mostly happens with the new clients. The older ones are a little more forgiving. >> Isaac: Okay. Cool. >> Stephanie: Hey, cheer up. [ Music ] >> Mike: Hey. >> Isaac: What's up? >> Mike: Welcome back. >> Isaac: Thanks, it's good to be back. >> Mike: Here why don't you help me out. >> Isaac: [Inaudible]. >> Shelia: Hi Isaac. >> Isaac: Hey. >> Shelia: Glad you're back. >> Isaac: Well glad to be back.

Well if there's anything I can do to change your mind let me know [hanging up phone]. [ Music ] [ Knocking ] Come in. >> John: [Background Music] I've been going over your finances. I really don't know how to tell you this. But when tax time comes around it looks like you're going to be about a million dollars short. >> Isaac: I mean how could this be? I thought I had lots of money left? >> John: Well there's still money in the account; it's not enough. >> Isaac: I can't believe this. When I had a little bit of money I managed everything fine. Now that I got lots I can't even make it last. >> John: It happens. I've seen that many times. >> Isaac: Well I guess I'll sell the mansion just to cover the taxes. >> John: Well you might be okay. Tax time isn't for a few months yet. Maybe the company will turn around and start making a profit again. >> Isaac: Well maybe, maybe not. The bottom line is I don't want the business to fail and people lose their jobs here. >> John: Well don't give up hope yet. Let's see how things go for the next few months. >> Isaac: All right, thanks. Can I talk to you for a minute? >> Henry: [Background Music] Sure. >> Isaac: I didn't realize you were a Christian. >> Henry: Yes I am. >> Isaac: Me too. >> Henry: Really? I didn't realize that. >> Isaac: So how long you been a Christian? >> Henry: About 15 years now. >> Isaac: So why'd you treat me so bad when I was a janitor? >> Henry: I have to apologize for that. You know there's really no excuse for they way I treated you. I was trying to get you to quit so that I could save the company money by hiring a cleaning crew that would do it at half-cost. >> Isaac: Well I accept your apology and I have to apologize myself. I'm guilty of some wrong. See the only reason I bought this company was to get back at you. >> Henry: I know. You're pretty good at this whole revenge thing. >> Isaac: [Laughter] Why don't we call a truce? Let's work with each other instead of against each other. >> Henry: Sounds good to me. >> Isaac: All right. So I guess you need your old job back? >> Henry: That would be nice. >> Isaac: Chris. I guess you got your old job back. >> Chris: Are you serious? >> Isaac: Yup. >> Chris: You don't even realize how much that means to me. I can't drink any more water to be quite honest. >> Isaac: I didn't realize you missed it that much. >> Chris: Oh come on Isaac. I've been asking for it every day. Look I still don't even know what a Chief Operating Officer does. Look, I'm your mailroom guy all right? >> Isaac: Okay. >> Chris: All right. >> Isaac: All right. >> Chris: Speaking of which I don't know who you hired but not so good. But I'll go pick it up right now. All right guys? And thank you again. >> Isaac: All right. See you later Chris. >> Chris: About the mailroom position. So we really need a full-time mailroom attendant? Just kidding [laughter]. >> Isaac: Well I guess you better get back to work. I kind of made a little mess of this whole place. >> Henry: Nothing that can't be fixed. >> Isaac: Man I was hoping you would say that. [ Music ] >> John: [Inaudible]? >> Isaac: Yeah, I need to move this thing. I keep kicking the mouse cord out. >> John: Got some good news. >> Isaac: Okay, let's hear it. >> John: You don't need to sell your mansion. Looks like the companies on track to make enough money to cover your taxes and they'll be enough left over to cover the payroll and the operating costs, as well. >> Isaac: Okay. Well that's really good news. Well I guess the company will break even right? >> John: Yep. >> Isaac: All right. Well thanks. >> John: No problem. [ Noises and Footsteps ] [ Music ] >> Isaac: [Background Music] Why didn't I think of this earlier? I want to thank you all for meeting with me today. I got a new ad campaign that I really, really want to do. Check it out. So what do ya'll think? >> Stephanie: I really like this idea. >> David: We can do this. >> And you'll actually want to client t leave and go with someone else [laughter]. >> Isaac: [Inaudible]. >> Shelia: Hey. >> Isaac: Hey. Got a gift for you. >> Shelia: What did you get me now? I hope that's not a box of chocolates. >> Isaac: Actually it's a gift for a bunch of kids but I think you'll like it. >> Shelia: Well what is it? >> Isaac: Open it up. See for yourself. [ Unwrapping Gift ] >> Isaac: [Laughter] Do you like it? >> Shelia: Well yeah, but I'm not really much of a TV watcher. >> Isaac: Well actually that's not the gift [rustling and footsteps]. Take a seat. >> Shelia: [Laughter]. >> Isaac: Now watch this. Hi, I want to introduce you to my friend Steven. Steven's a good kid looking for a loving family of his own. He and the rest of my friends behind me are all looking for a nice home. But most importantly a loving family. Have you ever thought of adoption or just thinking about it, call the number on the screen for more information. Thanks. >> Thanks. >> Isaac: So since I own an ad agency I decided to run a new ad for the children's shelter. Hopefully we can get all these kids adopted. >> Shelia: That is a great gift [laughter]. >> Isaac: Finally. >> Shelia: [Laughter]. >> Isaac: All right, that should solve the problem right there. Hey, come on in. >> Henry: I just want to introduce you to my wife Monica and this is the newest addition to our family Kyle. >> Isaac: Well it's nice to meet you. >> Monica: You too. >> Isaac: Hey Kyle. What's up [laughter]? >> Henry: We just adopted him. >> Isaac: Oh for real? Wow. That's cool, that's real cool. He's so cute. >> Henry: [Laughter] We just wanted to thank you and let you know that our ad campaign was a big success. Looks like you have a future in this business. >> Isaac: Well thanks. >> Henry: Hey, keep up the good work. >> Isaac: Thank you. >> Henry: Hmm-mm. >> Isaac: Bye Kyle. Bye.
