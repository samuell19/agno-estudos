DR. DEXTER: As your doctor, l'm having you continue this with the pharmacist. DR. DEXTER: But as yourfriend, l'm asking you to meet me halfway. DR. DEXTER: The first step towards any real progress is communication , Robert. DR. DEXTER: And that's a two-way street... lneed your help. DR. DEXTER: You 're not just a patient. DR. DEXTER: l made a promise to your Mother; one l intend fully to keep. DR. DEXTER: Anytime, day or night, you need to talk, you call me. l'll be there for you . LANDLADY: Three-thirty, back from the druggist; l can set my watch by you . LANDLADY: And pays his rent on time, just like clockwork. LANDLADY: l wish all my tenants could be like you . LANDLADY: You 're a good, reliable man . That's hard to find these days. LANDLADY: All those pills you take. That's not what you need. LANDLADY: The druggist doesn 't have your cure. LANDLADY: What you need is a good woman . LANDLADY: l want you to meet my niece. LANDLADY: She's coming here from New York. LANDLADY: She'd be good for you . She's pretty. LANDLADY: She doesn 't have any friends either. And she's a good cook. LANDLADY: She'd make you a good healthy dinner... LANDLADY: Okay? PlCKMAN: Alright... ART DEALER: Twelve noon , right on the dot. Are you ever late, Mr. Pickman ? ART DEALER: l have good news for you . ART DEALER: l got you another commission , a bed and breakfast out in the country. ART DEALER: This old lady is redoing her guestrooms and wants several paintings to match her new wallpaper. ART DEALER: l got herto commit to six. Six! ART DEALER: That will pay both of our rents for the rest of the year. ART DEALER: But l can 't take any credit; it's never been hard to sell a Pickman . ART DEALER: You have quite a knack for painting those Lighthouses and Seascapes. These old ladies love you . ART DEALER: Here are the swatches forthe wallpaper, so you can match the colors. ART DEALER: What's this? This isn 't the painting we discussed. ART DEALER: l know this painting. ART DEALER: This was the one rejected by that decorator -- and rightly so. ART DEALER: This isn 't your normal work. Look at these brush strokes... ART DEALER: ...very amateurish, and there's no soul, no emotions... ART DEALER: My God, Pickman; that was over a month ago. ART DEALER: Do you mean to tell me you haven 't painted anything new since then ? ART DEALER: This is our livelihood, Pickman . ART DEALER: This puts us way behind. Ashcroft is expecting four paintings, and he's not a patient man . ART DEALER: What am l supposed to tell him? PlCKMAN: Fine! Tell him l can 't do it anymore. ART DEALER: Robert. ART DEALER: Alright, Robert, l'm sorry. Maybe l've been overworking you a bit. ART DEALER: lt's just that the money has been so good. ART DEALER: Alright, take some time away. l'll stall Ashcroft for a week ortwo... ART DEALER: Travel; go on vacation; see some new sights. PlCKMAN: What's the point? lt all looks the same...no? ART DEALER: Oh, God... DR. DEXTER: Robert? lt's Ambrose Dexter. PlCKMAN: What do you want? LANDLADY: l'm so sorry. Your doctorthought you might be needing help. DR. DEXTER: Robert, You missed two appointments. l was concerned. l was worried. PlCKMAN: l've been working. LANDLADY: l'm very sorry, Mr. Pickman . We'll be leaving you now. DR. DEXTER: Working...? Robert, you 're painting again ? DR. DEXTER: That's wonderful! What brought you around? PlCKMAN: Doc, ljust don 't have time to get into it right now; l have to get back to work. LANDLADY: Yes, of course. Sorry to have disturbed you . DR. DEXTER: Well, Robert, you know l'm the last man in the world that would everwant to stop you from getting back to work... DR. DEXTER: But, when you have the time, come on in and make an appointment... DR. DEXTER: You know there's always room for you in my schedule. PlCKMAN: Yes. l will. ART DEALER: Well, l'll be. What are you doing here today, Mr. Pickman ? This isn 't your usual appointment. PlCKMAN: l need money for more paint and canvases and supplies and stuff. PlCKMAN: Look. Can you sell this? ART DEALER: lnteresting. Where did you get this, Mr. Pickman ? PlCKMAN: What do you mean ? lt's mine. ART DEALER: Yours? PlCKMAN: Yeah. l painted it. ART DEALER: You 're joking with me. PlCKMAN: No. ART DEALER: This isn 't anything like yourwork. ART DEALER: l'd swearthis was the work of Goodie Hines. PlCKMAN: No. lt's my work. ART DEALER: l've seen my share of recreations of Goodie's work... ART DEALER: but this, by far, is the best l've ever seen . PlCKMAN: No, no, no. This is not a recreation . PlCKMAN: This is an example of my new stuff, my new work. PlCKMAN: l don 't even know who Goodie Hines is... ART DEALER: Don 't you ever read the papers? ''The Vicious Visionary'', ''The Painter of Pain ''. ART DEALER: The media had a field day with him. ART DEALER: You really should keep up with the news. He killed and mutilated seven people. ART DEALER: He cut their eyes out while they were still living. He said they begged him to do it. PlCKMAN: l'm sure they did... l still don 't know who he is. ART DEALER: You should. He's up at County Hospital with your Dr. Dexter. ART DEALER: Ambrose Dexter is your doctor, right? PlCKMAN: Yeah. ART DEALER: He never mentioned Goodie? PlCKMAN: No! l don 't even know why he would. ART DEALER: Your Doctor kept Goodie from getting the Chair. ART DEALER: Sometimes l think you live in a bubble. You know that, Robert?. PlCKMAN: Maybe l do. ljust came by for supplies... ART DEALER: Ever since all that horrible business... ART DEALER: l've got people coming in here all the time trying to pass off imitations of Goodie's work... ART DEALER: ...especially of the church. ARTDEALER: This is the best example l've seen . ART DEALER: And you 've never seen one of Goodie's paintings? PlCKMAN: ljust don 't know how many times l can tell you -- no. ART DEALER: That's simply amazing. Well, l want to show you something. PlCKMAN: Show me what? ART DEALER: One of Goodie's works, of course. l've got one of the last ones. ART DEALER: Managed to get one before they locked them all up as evidence. ART DEALER: And l'm going to retire on that sale when the time's right. PlCKMAN: l don 't have time right now. ljust need the supplies... ART DEALER: l'll take care of your supplies. But come on , l want to show you this. ART DEALER: l'm embarrassed to say it, but those murders were a real boon for sales. ART DEALER: You know what they say: Nothing improves the price of an artist's work more than death, or insanity. ART DEALER: l had a feeling something was not right with Goodie when he starting signing his paintings differently. ART DEALER: Strange little thing, really; he began connecting the two O's in Goodie like the sign for infinity. ART DEALER: Yep. Amazing piece of work, isn 't it? ART DEALER: Say what you want about the material, but no one has a right to deprive the art community of such work. PlCKMAN: l've never seen anything like this. ARTDEALER: This is one of his last pieces. His most radical change in style. ART DEALER: Don 't stare at it too long; it'll give you one hell of a headache. ART DEALER: Something he does with the angles, the way they are all wrong like that. ART DEALER: You 'll get a pain in your head a handful of aspirins won 't get rid of -- trust me. ART DEALER: Hideous and beautiful all at the same time -- isn 't it? PlCKMAN: l'd give anything to paint like this. ART DEALER: He had such an incredible imagination . ART DEALER: No matter how horrible the image, you feel as if you know it, or should know it. PlCKMAN: Like a forgotten nightmare... ART DEALER: Look at the faces of the victims. ART DEALER: The anguish is so real, and every inch of that strange landscape holds a weight to it, a truth. ART DEALER: As if it were drawn from a photograph and not pulled from his imagination . ART DEALER: As if he were there. ART DEALER: He would go on and on about anotherworld that he said he was able to look upon through a secret window. ART DEALER: He was painting like an out of control fire. ART DEALER: At times l almost though the was afraid of what would happen if he should stop... ART DEALER: But nothing kept him from getting his worlds onto canvas. ART DEALER: Even when he ran out of supplies, he found a way... ART DEALER: When he ran out of canvases, he simply painted overwhat was his first obsession ... PlCKMAN: lt's the church... The church on Federal Hill. ART DEALER: lt's almost like a watermark for any of Goodie's final work. GUARD: Dr. Dexter, l'm glad to see you . l've been paging you . DR. DEXTER: ls Doctor Meyer alright?. GUARD: Yes. DR. DEXTER: Was he with Goodie Hines? GUARD: He's still down there. DR. DEXTER: l was in the otherwing. The orderly told me.... Are you all right? RlCHARD: Yes. l'll be fine. RlCHARD: lt's just a scratch; it'll heal. RlCHARD: l'm not so sure about my pride. DR. DEXTER: What happened? RlCHARD: l wasn 't paying attention . l was concentrating on my notes, and l let Goodie get too close... RlCHARD: He managed to get my fountain pen from me. DR. DEXTER: Oh, Richard..! RlCHARD: l know, l know. l feel so foolish. DR. DEXTER: That's all l need today, Goodie Hines with a pen . DR. DEXTER: You know how hard it's going to be to get that pen from him? DR. DEXTER: We might as well be trying to unscrew all his limbs. RlCHARD: l'm sorry. l feel like a first year resident. DR. DEXTER: No, the important thing is you 're all right. DR. DEXTER: l want you to get down to the infirmary and have that hand cleaned thoroughly. DR. DEXTER: We'll take care of this... DR. DEXTER: Get nurse Julie. She's good with sedatives. Lithium. GUARD: She's already on the way. RlCHARD: Are you sure? DR. DEXTER: lt'll be fine. Go to the infirmary. RlCHARD: And don 't think about keeping that pen ... RlCHARD: lt was a gift from my fatherwhen l got my degree. DR. DEXTER: l'll get the pen . l might ask forthe degree back. RlCHARD: Ouch, that hurt doctor. DR. DEXTER: lt was meant to... DR. DEXTER: Goodie, we can 't let you keep that pen . DR. DEXTER: We need him sedated and restrained. GOODlE: Don 't take it away from me! Don 't take it away! GOODlE: l can draw you the truth! GOODlE: l can draw you all the forgotten gods and forgotten places that man refuses to see... GOODlE: Let me draw it for you ! Let me draw it for you ! Let me draw it for you ..! VOICE.. Come- to us.

LANDLADY: She spent all morning cooking. LANDLADY: What do you think Mr. Pickman ? She is pretty, no? PlCKMAN: Yeah...fine...you know -- whatever... PlCKMAN: Come on in ... let's just get this overwith... LANDLADY: What is this thing you are doing in my apartment..? LANDLADY: What sort of man are you ?! LANDLADY: Such horrible thing... lt's terrible. LANDLADY: lt must be destroyed! LANDLADY: lt's garbage! LANDLADY: ...must go in garbage! PlCKMAN: Let go! PlCKMAN: Don 't touch my things. PlCKMAN: l invite you into my house and you do this... PlCKMAN: Leave me! DR. DEXTER: What's wrong, dear... DR. DEXTER: ...is Mr. Pickman alright? NlECE: No. NlECE: He's a terrible man . NlECE: Why would anyone paint those things? DR. DEXTER: Now slow down . DR. DEXTER: Tell me exactly what happened. NlECE: My Aunt brought me up to introduce me to Mr. Pickman . NlECE: She said he was a good man . NlECE: But a good man would never paint those places. NlECE: My Aunt cursed at him when she saw those ''things'' he had painted. NlECE: Horrible, horrible places. NlECE: The angles were all wrong... NlECE: ...and they made me dizzy to look at them. NlECE: But they looked so real. NlECE: l don 't know how someone can imagine those kinds of nightmares. NlECE: l called the police. NlECE: No one should allow what he has done. NlECE: Please don 't look at those paintings, for your own good. NlECE: l am so afraid. NlECE: l'm afraid l won 't be able to forget what l've seen . POLlCEMAN: Look, l need you to understand, there is nothing l can do! POLlCEMAN: He hasn 't broken any laws. LANDLADY: Those are sins! LANDLADY: These things do not belong in this world. LANDLADY: l want him out. POLlCEMAN: Whoa... Whoa... Who are you ?! DR. DEXTER: l'm DoctorAmbrose Dexter. DR.

Look at what he's brought into my home. LANDLADY: Look at it! LANDLADY: You see! You see! LANDLADY: An abomination on all that is good! PlCKMAN: You don 't like it, you don 't have to look at it. LANDLADY: lgnoring sin is more of a sin than sin itself. LANDLADY: Turning a blind eye, this is how evil is able to slowly creep into this world. LANDLADY: Don 't you see what he's brought in here? LANDLADY: Why don 't you do something?! POLlCEMAN: There's nothing we can do. POLlCEMAN: By law he hasn 't done anything wrong. LANDLADY: Are you blind?! POLlCEMAN: Please, Lady, we can 't let you bother your tenant like this. POLlCEMAN: He hasn 't broken any laws. PlCKMAN: My rent is paid in full. PlCKMAN: l don 't have to put up with these disturbances anymore. LANDLADY: At the end of the month, you 're out! PlCKMAN: Well, l have a signed lease! PlCKMAN: l don 't want to see you again ! POLlCEMAN: Mister, understand this. POLlCEMAN: The reason l'm not taking you downtown is because l can 't... POLlCEMAN: ...not because l don 't agree with her... POLlCEMAN: ...because l do! POLlCEMAN: There's nothing on the books l can charge you with. POLlCEMAN: But keep it up. Just give me a reason . PlCKMAN: Okay. You want to handle a real disturbance for a change? PlCKMAN: You want to act like a real cop? PlCKMAN: Then you can do something about that damn dog! PlCKMAN: You have no idea how many paintings that yapping mutt has shoved out of my head. PlCKMAN: They're simpletons, you know... PlCKMAN: Simple...simple...simpletons... PlCKMAN: They know nothing about art -- or creativity... DR. DEXTER: Robert, your landlady is going to evict you ! PlCKMAN: l can handle my landlady. PlCKMAN: Nothing a little bit of money won 't solve -- right? DR. DEXTER: l'm afraid not. lt's gone way beyond that. DR. DEXTER: l don 't claim to understand what you 've gotten yourself involved with... DR. DEXTER: But, l have to intervene. PlCKMAN: Oh, is that right? PlCKMAN: l'm sorry to inconvenience you ... PlCKMAN: But l actually have to get back to work now. My paintings... DR. DEXTER: Robert, l've seen these painting before -- l know them! PlCKMAN: l don 't have time for your games. DR. DEXTER: This is not a game. DR. DEXTER: Where did you get the ideas forthese images? PlCKMAN: You can call it inspiration . DR. DEXTER: Did Goodie Hines inspire you ? PlCKMAN: Goodie. Goodie. Goodie. That's the second time l've heard that name this week. PlCKMAN: One of yourfailed patients, l understand. DR. DEXTER: Listen to me... DR. DEXTER: Your paintings are identical to his... DR. DEXTER: Where did you get the ideas forthese images? PlCKMAN: So now you call me a plagiarist! PlCKMAN: A plagiarist! As if l'm not capable of painting something myself! PlCKMAN: Doc... PlCKMAN: Our relationship is over; lneed you to leave. PlCKMAN: You never respected me. PlCKMAN: And if you want these pictures of the church -- you can have them. PlCKMAN: Consider it yourfinal payment. PlCKMAN: Please,just leave. DR. DEXTER: Pardon me young ladies. DR. DEXTER: l noticed something odd in the churchyard overthere... DR. DEXTER: Do any of you know anything about it? GlRL: A nasty octopus, or a squid, or something -- right? GlRL: That thing is stinking up the street! GlRL: Probably one of the boys did it. DR. DEXTER: Why would they do something like that?. GlRL: They try to show each otherthey're not scared. DR. DEXTER: Scared? Of the Church? DR. DEXTER: You girls don 't believe in ghosts -- do you ? GlRL: Not ghosts, something worse. GlRL: The boys put that thing in the yard to make fun of their religion . GlRL: Guess it looks like some of the stuff they used to pray to in there. DR. DEXTER: l don 't understand. DR. DEXTER: What does that thing in the yard have to do with a Catholic Church? GlRL: lt's not a Catholic Church anymore. GlRL: lt hasn 't been for like a hundred years. GlRL: They sold it off. DR. DEXTER: Who bought it? GlRL: Whoeverthey were, they didn 't pray to God in there. GlRL: That's why they got run off a long time ago. GlRL: No one wants anything to do with the place. GlRL: l think it's betterto just leave it alone. DR. DEXTER: You really think people are that scared of the place? GlRL: Sure. Can 't you tell by just looking at it? GlRL: Hadn 't you noticed? DR. DEXTER: No. Notice what? GlRL: The windows. GlRL: You ever seen an abandoned building without one single broken window? GlRL: And you know how boys are... CLERK: May we help you ? DR. DEXTER: Yes. l need to know who holds the deed to a piece of property. CLERK: What's the address you 're searching for, Sir? DR. DEXTER: Well, l'm not sure of the exact address. CLERK: We can 't do a search without an address. DR. DEXTER: Well, it shouldn 't be too hard to find. DR. DEXTER: lt's the church at the top of Federal Hill; it's the only one up there. CLERK: What is that? 1700 West? CLERK: 1800 West. CLERK: Hold on , let me take a look. CLERK: Here it is. CLERK: lt shows here that it had several owners since the Catholic Church sold it off. DR. DEXTER: Who's the current owner? CLERK: lt's a holding company: RF&R. CLERK: They've overseen the property for over seventy-five years. CLERK: Not a single tax payment missed. lt's all legit. DR. DEXTER: How do l get a hold of this RF&R? CLERK: Seems to be based out of London ... DR. DEXTER: Seems?! CLERK: Yeah, sorry. This information isn 't exactly up to date. CLERK: Doesn 't look like any of this info has been put into our new computer system. CLERK: Sorry. But there are several references here to a religious organization named ''Starry Wisdom''. DR. DEXTER: Did you say Starry Wisdom? CLERK: Yes, it's the name of the organization at the time of purchase. DR. DEXTER: Starry Wisdom... CLERK: Are you ok? CLERK: Can l get you a glass of water or something? CLERK: You look like you 've seen a ghost. GOODlE: l'd wake up every day staring out the window... GOODlE: ...praying for something, anything, different then what l had seen the day before. GOODlE: Anything. GOODlE: Beauty. GOODlE: Horror. GOODlE: Anything but the same horizon , the same blue sky. GOODlE: But each day just ticked before me like the next... GOODlE: ...like a metronome. GOODlE: Tick... Tock... Tick... Tock... GOODlE: Pounding the same question into my mind! GOODlE: Why...?! GOODlE: Why... go on ? GOODlE: The only thing that would turn me back... GOODlE: ...was the sudden fearthat what might be next, may be even more tedious. GOODlE: Then l found Starry Wisdom. GOODlE: Starry Wisdom holds the window... GOODlE: ...which shows me the world unseen . lNTERVlEWER: Does this Starry Wisdom tell you to do things? GOODlE: Yes... Oh, yes. GOODlE: For my duties, l am rewarded. lNTERVlEWER: Rewarded? What kind of reward? GOODlE: To see! GOODlE: The reward is to see... lNTERVlEWER: l'm interested, Goodie... lNTERVlEWER: ...why do you keep referring to your creative side as that? GOODlE: As what?. lNTERVlEWER: Starry Wisdom. lNTERVlEWER: That's what Starry Wisdom is, isn 't it...? lNTERVlEWER: Your creative side? Your imagination ? lNTERVlEWER: Why do you choose to call it that?. GOODlE: You think Starry Wisdom is a metaphor? GOODlE: A simile? GOODlE: A fabrication of my mind? GOODlE: Well, my mind is clear... GOODlE: Yours is clouded. GOODlE: You haven 't heard a thing l've said. GOODlE: You 're blind. GOODlE: All of you are blind! GOODlE: Starry Wisdom is real! GOODlE: Starry Wisdom is right on the horizon , but you can 't see it. GOODlE: lt's right under your nose. GOODlE: Look out any window in this city and you will see it! GOODlE: You will see it...! PlCKMAN: Shut up... PlCKMAN: Shut up... PlCKMAN: You know some of us are trying to work! PlCKMAN: ljust need some peace and quiet. PlCKMAN: Shut the dog up! VOlCE: No distractions... LANDLADY: Pickman , l know you 're in there. LANDLADY: Pickman , l'm here with the police. LANDLADY: They want to talk to you . LANDLADY: Pickman , do you hear me?! PlCKMAN: lt'll be just a second... PlCKMAN: Just give me one more minute! LANDLADY: Pickman ! PlCKMAN: Yeah...Yeah, l'll be there in just a second! Okay? LANDLADY: Pickman ! Do you hear!? PlCKMAN: Just a second, l'm just getting some clothes. PlCKMAN: Just a minute, l'll be right there. LANDLADY: We haven 't got all day! LANDLADY: Pickman ...! PlCKMAN: Yeah. What do you want? LANDLADY: This detective wants to talk to you . DETECTlVE: Someone killed a dog last night. LANDLADY: lt wasn 't killed. lt was butchered. LANDLADY: And the parts laid out -- like in some of those paintings of yours. DETECTlVE: We're just checking the building to see if anyone saw or heard anything. DETECTlVE: Did you , sir? PlCKMAN: No...no... PlCKMAN: l didn 't see anything. DETECTlVE: Didn 't you file a number of noise complaints against the owners of that dog? PlCKMAN: Yeah. PlCKMAN: You telling me l'm the only one that's complained about that yapping dog? DETECTlVE: Call the Precinct in case you happen to remember anything. PlCKMAN: Yes. l will.

You know he's going to find about this. RlCHARD: And when he does, he's going to remove you from the Board. DR. DEXTER: l can handle Petersen . lt'll be alright. RlCHARD: People with your attitude... RlCHARD: Robert has never done anything wrong in his entire life. RlCHARD: He's nevertried to harm anyone. Or himself! DR. DEXTER: Neither did Goodie! RlCHARD: What?! DR. DEXTER: Look! l need you to listen to me. DR. DEXTER: Starry Wisdom is an actual physical place. RlCHARD: Starry Wisdom?! DR.

DEXTER: ...to give a name to his delusional states. lt's an actual physical place. DR. DEXTER: lt's that church on Federal Hill. RlCHARD: What does this have to do with you busting into Robert Pickman 's studio today? DR. DEXTER: lt has everything to do with it! DR. DEXTER: Look. DR.
