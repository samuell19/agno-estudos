(gentle music) (crickets chirping) (somber electronic music) Hi, guys. My name is Ava Robbins, and I am making this video, you know, to look back on one day when I'm hopefully in a better place. (somber electronic music) Three years ago, my parents passed away, and, if I'm honest, it's not getting easier, so I've decided it's time I take control of my life. I used up all the money I had and I bought a van, a Westy, and I'm gonna pack it up and travel the United States. No sleep 'til Brooklyn!

Hey, can you hear me? (Ava screams) Hey, guys, I know I've been MIA the last couple months, and you guys have no idea how much I've missed you. I know you've been worried and leaving comments, but I'm back. You know how I've always wanted to buy a little cabin in the woods? Well, I actually did it. I pulled the trigger and bought this little place. I really believe in listening to the signs from the universe, and some signs are more convincing than others. I had a little fender bender. Let's say the deer got away to live another day. My van, not so much, neither did my forehead, and here comes my new fairy godmother. What do you have to tell the good people, Dottie? She's all yours. Thank you so much for everything. Let me know if you need anything else. And here comes my knight in shining skinny jeans. (truck horn beeps) Kellen found my ass broken down on the side of the road after I hit that deer. He's been amazing these last couple of months, helping me recuperate, helping me settle in. I couldn't ask for a better friend. You're gonna get so many likes from this video. Do you know that? All for little ole me, huh? I told you guys the scenery was nice out here. Okay. Let's go to the house. This is the bedroom. It's quaint. Look at all the great stuff this place came with. So much potential. So many projects coming soon. Oh! Like fixing the floorboards before I break my neck. Hey. I put the van in the shed. (gentle music) All right. Let me know if you need anything else. (gentle music) (insects buzzing) (birds chirping) (gentle music continues) (Ava indistinctly mutters) This really feels like a fresh start, a place I can finally call home. I haven't had that since I lost my parents, but you guys are all family to me now, and I wanna thank you guys so much. I can't believe I just hit 600,000 subscribers. I remember when I used to get excited about 10 likes on a new video. So, I'm no longer Van Girl. Call me Cabin Girl. And I'm just so grateful you guys have been there every step of the way, and now look at me.

Sure beats a Walmart parking lot. Now, coffee. (kettle whistling) Okay, so, finally, I can sleep at night. You finally posted. Oh, I feel like I can breathe a sigh of relief. Ava's back. Thank God. We missed you. It's good to see you, and whatever you got going on, we're here for, okay? Just stick around and we will too. You guys know I like to write three things I'm grateful for every day. It keeps me from getting into asshole mode. There we go. No peeking. (upbeat music) Mm. The first sip of coffee in the morning is almost spiritual. It makes me feel like I can do anything.

I'm brand new, so any tips and tricks are welcome, and, Ava Robbins, if you happen to be watching this, I'm your biggest fan! Hey, guys. Good news and a little bit of disappointing news. Ava is back, but it seems like she is ditching van life, like many other people in the van life community right now, and I didn't expect her to go that route, so. I just really fell in love with this place while I was recovering, and, I don't know, it's just like living in simpler times. Lookie here. Hey, stranger. How's cabin life? Rustic. How's engine life? It's rusty. It looks pretty good from over here, and my ladies out there, he's single. (Kellen chuckles) Hey, now. Don't forget about me. Uncle Dave is single too. Hey, I'll put the word out. (Dave chuckles) All right, I'm gonna leave you and your dimples alone and go hike on my lonesome. Text me later? I know I'm biased, but, man, he's cute. Oh, oh! Oh, geez. Oh! I'm so sorry. No, it's okay, Ava. Hi. Dr. Doucet. How is your head? Well, I forgot your name. Well, come by my office next week and we'll see how you're doing. You got it. Okay. Do you wanna say hi to my viewers? Sure. Hi, viewers! Okay. Awesome. Have a good day. All righty. (eerie music) (solemn music) Hey, now. Don't forget about me. Uncle Dave is single too. Hey, I'll put the word out. (car engine rumbles) (foreboding music) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (birds chirping) Well, guys, it's been a long day. I think it's time to head back to the cabin, huh? Ava. (eerie music) Hello? (eerie music) I have pepper spray! (ghostly voices indistinctly whispering) (eerie music) (eerie music continues) (eerie music continues) (eerie music continues) Do you guys see that? What is that? (engine roars) (Ava screams) (tires squeal) (eerie music) (eerie music continues) What do you guys think happened to her? She jumped. Oh, you scared me. She tied a cinder block around her waist and she dove in headfirst. God. Why? Wanted to make it stick, I guess. (somber music) Ava. Trina. I'm guessing you're the internet girl. Wow. Word travels fast around here. I mean, it is a small town. There are no secrets. Just gossip. Thanks for the heads up. Well, I own the best bar in town. It is the only bar, the Mystic Fox. You should pop in sometime for a drink. (Ava screams) Hey, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I just need to sit down. (idyllic country music) (country singer indistinctly singing) Just take it easy. The internet can wait. It can't. My subscribers are everything to me. I can't let 'em down. That sounds fulfilling. I'm lucky. I didn't have much going on before this. Now I have a real sense of purpose. Thanks for the ride. (country singer indistinctly singing) Oh, shit. (solemn music) What? I didn't know this place was for sale. Why wouldn't it be? This is where Hannah Granger used to live. What are the chances of that? Hey, guys, so, you know, I went on a hike today, tried to explore my new grounds, and I came across this really haunting memorial that had been defaced. Turns out it belongs to this young woman named Hannah Granger, who actually jumped to her death on this bridge right here. I just can't imagine the amount of pain you need to be in to do that, and so I wish her peace and love wherever she is. You know I don't believe in coincidences, but, at the time of her death, she was living in my cabin. I don't know if it's a sign or an omen, but I'm really glad you guys are here to figure it out with me. (solemn music) (crickets chirping) A lot of you guys have had questions since I've been offline, so I thought we could do a little cozy Q and A session. Okay. This is one I've been getting a lot. "When will you get back on the road?" Probably not soon. The doc said it's at least three months until I can drive again, and, honestly, I think I might need longer. You know, I'm just not in a rush, and I just know I can bring a good, new energy to this place and I wanna share my experiences with you guys and I want you guys to send me positive vibes. Okay, hold on. We're having trouble with the internet. Okay. There we go. (books creak) Did you guys see that? (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (Ava gasps) (mouse squeaks) Aw! Did you miss me? Okay, come here. Nope. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. In you go. I would like it if you found a home of your own, little ghost. Mystery solved, but my heart is still racing, so I think maybe that's where we call it a night. Mhm. Mwah! (foreboding music) (crickets chirping) (foreboding music continues) (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (wood clattering) (ominous music continues) Ava.

One of a kind. You're gonna love it there. I gotta run. Bye. Hello. I was hoping you could help me with a cabin. What have you sold recently? Any small fixer-uppers? If I saw some of those properties, maybe I'd get a better sense of the marketplace. (foreboding music) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (car horn honking) (rock music indistinctly playing) Hey there. Can I give you a ride somewhere? No, no, it's okay. I'm enjoying riding a bike, and, you know, the quiet. Well, it's a ways into town. I'm vlogging, and, you know, I'm good. Just stop by the shop, okay? Your rear tire's looking a little flat. I can pump it up for you. I'm sure you can. (Kellen chuckles) All right. I'll see you. See you. (rock music indistinctly playing) (gentle music indistinctly playing) Hey. How'd that varnish work out? Great. Best ever. Now I need a new latch for my shed. Oh, yeah, let's see. Yep. Let's call it 30. Good morning, sheriff. Popcorn machine working? Triple butter, just the way you like it. Oh, son, you never disappoint. Ma'am. Always a pleasure, miss. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (Ava sighs) (bike pump whirring) (rock music playing) All right. Well, you might have a slow leak, but I can order a new tire. It'll probably get here in a couple of days. Oh, yeah, that's great. Yeah. Well, thank you. You sure you don't want that ride? I'm good. (eerie music) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you all right? Yeah, yeah. I'll take that ride. Cool. Come on. (thunder faintly rumbling) (foreboding music) (foreboding music continues) (engine rumbling) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (birds chirping) (Ava and Kellen chuckle) How do you like living out here in the middle of nowhere? It's not nowhere. It's here. I like the solitude. Yeah, I bet. Being a big internet star, you probably get all kinds of weirdos bothering you, right? Mhm. There was one guy who kept coming to my meet and greets all over the country. I woke up to him trying to break into my van with handcuffs. What did you do? It was a nightmare. The police got involved and it was just a mess. (drill whirs) You ever hear of Hannah Granger? Sure. Everyone around here has. She lived in my cabin. No way. Yep. So, what's her story? You really wanna know? Yeah. This is beautiful. Beats the Walmart parking lot, huh? That's my line. Are you sure you're not a subscriber? So they say Hannah was an actual witch, and after she jumped from this bridge, everyone started calling it Suicide Bridge, and if you stand too close to the edge, Hannah's ghost will push you off. Yikes. Or, worse, possess your soul for eternity. Aw. Sounds like wholesome fun. It was scary as hell This one time, some kid really flipped out 'cause he thought he saw a ghost. Almost fell in. Kind of stopped after that. (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (engine rumbling) (cow moos) (birds chirping) (gentle music) Are you lost? (gentle music) (camera clicking) (eerie music) (tires squeal) (phone clicks) Hi. Is this the sheriff? Someone's cow got loose and ended up in my yard. Shit. (Ava sighs) (solemn music) (lively radio music playing) Hey, guys. I thought I'd give you guys a little update. Cabin life has been very peaceful. Kellen came over today to fix my latch, and don't get any dirty ideas. He actually fixed the latch on my shed. (Kellen chuckles) But he gave me the scoop on Hannah, and she was into witchcraft or a Wiccan. I just wish I knew what she was going through, because, why would she do that? When I lost my parents, I still felt like they were around me, like I could just close my eyes and they'd be by me, and I just feel like our energy has to make an imprint in this world. I mean, especially after everything we go through in life, you know? So, maybe Hannah spirit's still here, or maybe I'm getting a little woo-woo in the woods alone after all this time. I don't know. It's getting a little dark, so I think I'm gonna go ahead and call it tonight. Bye, guys. (foreboding music) (crickets chirping) (foreboding music continues) Ava. (eerie music) (eerie music continues) You? (eerie music) (crickets chirping) (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (book thumps) (books thump) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (crickets chirping) (solemn music) (solemn music continues) (solemn music continues) Sorry to bother you, ma'am. It's fine. I was just resting my eyes. I got that call about the cow. Did you find it? Sure did. I had to put her down. What? Why? Oh, well, the coyotes got to her. Tore her near to pieces. (tires squeal) She was still breathing. (eerie music) Unfortunately, that's what can happen around here. You're new here, right? Welcome to the neighborhood. If you see any more of 'em, give us a call. Have a nice day. (solemn music) Like, I know I was glad that you were back, Ava, and, like, I'm sorry if you're seeing this, 'cause I was, like, your most loyal follower and fan, but, like, I really miss the old Ava. Like, I don't know who this is. I don't know where she's gone, but, please, please, old Ava, come back, because this is just some weird shit. Like, who actually believes in all this ghost crap? Hey, everyone. I just wanted to say I'm so glad that Ava is back. She's alive and well. That's the only thing that matters. Her last video, though, a little bit sketch. Not gonna comment on that now, though, because I'm gonna go hit the road. Oh, shit. Don't forget to like and subscribe to Van Doll. How are the headaches? Pretty bad. What about vision? Well, I'm having visions. (ghost gasps) Well, okay. Hallucinations are not that uncommon after a head injury. Ava, it's very important to remember that these moments and experiences are not real. A few deep breaths and they will pass. A few nights of good rest should really make a difference. (solemn music) (country music indistinctly playing) Hey, Ava. Welcome, and what will you have? A cold beer and the wifi password. "Fuckrightoff." Excuse me? Oh, that's the password. All lowercase. Got it. (ominous music) (ominous music continues) Can I ask you a question? Shoot. Is this how you spell Hannah Granger's name? Oh, honey, you're not gonna find anything online about her. Look where you are. No one in this town is blogging. Great. I just wanna find a little history about the place I sunk all my life savings into. I might be able to help. My dad was a hoarder, so we might get lucky. Come with me. Happy hunting. Take whatever you want. Thank you. (somber music) (somber music continues) "Elijah Granger has been declared a suspect in his sister's death." "Elijah Granger has been declared mentally unfit after also attempting to kill himself." "Committed to Brassard Institution. Little hope of recovery due to brain damage suffered in the suicide attempt." "Hannah Granger's death officially ruled suicide." (somber music) (country music indistinctly playing) Did you find what you need? More questions than answers. Why do you think Hannah jumped? I'm not sure she did. Back in the 1600s, they would push accused witches off a high cliff, because, if she was a witch, she'd fly away. You think she was pushed? I wouldn't rule it out. The Grangers were a powerful, wealthy family, and you know money can always buy innocence. Then why was she living in my old-ass cabin? Oh, they disowned her. She just wound up there, I guess. You know, I had a dream about her, and I can't get it out of my head. Do you think she's trying to tell me something? (country music indistinctly playing) You gotta be kidding. Unless you know a way to DM a dead girl. Eh, worth a shot. You know not to use that alone, right? Really? I'm sure Kellen would be happy to join you. Thanks again. Oh! Oh, shoot. I am so sorry. Oh. No, no, it's my fault. My fault. No, no, I was distracted. Shit. No, no, it's okay. No, you don't have to. No, no, no, no. No, no. I hope this wasn't expensive. Can I pay for dry cleaning? No, no, no. Okay. Well, I'm a mess today, so sorry again. Meet my new friend, Jody. Jackie. It's so amazing to meet you, Ava. I've been watching your videos for so long. You totally inspired me to get my own van and hit the road. That calls for a toast! Woo! I just had a thought I don't think enough people are thinking about. Hannah Granger jumped, or was pushed from a high spot, which is exactly how they used to try witches back in the day, push you off a cliff, and if you flew, oh, you're witch, and if you didn't, oh, our bad. Try again next time. I'm gonna go to the cemetery right now. See what I can see. See if there's any hints or... (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) What happened to you? (solemn music) (solemn music continues) Hey, guys. I'm at the cemetery where Hannah's buried. I'm starting to wonder what really happened to her. It doesn't make any sense. I mean, who knows? Maybe I'm gonna solve a murder cover-up. (door squeaks) (engine rumbling) (rock music playing) Hey, Cabin Girl. I got your new tire. Oh, thank God. Or me. Uh-uh. (birds chirping) (engine rumbling) Haven't you ever seen "The Exorcist"? Maybe I'm already possessed. (Kellen chuckles) I keep seeing her. (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (truck engine rumbling) Thanks. Do you have some time to kill? Sure. What the hell? It was probably tweakers. They like to break into old sheds and shoot up. Tweakers and ghosts. Anything else I need to know about? You got that price for a reason. This ain't Beverly Hills. Here. Let me check. (ominous music) Well, another day. (ominous music) (ominous music continues) Okay. Do you really need to do that? Yes. It's proof. I should not have told you about Hannah Granger. Look, I know this is a little out there, but I really feel like she's trying to tell me something. I feel it. Did you know her brother was a suspect? Hey, but she killed herself, okay? I don't blame the poor girl. There's not many other ways out of this town. That's a little morbid. Yeah. well, you're trying to talk to a dead girl on a Ouija board, so. So, let's go. Come on. You take two fingers and you place them on the planchette. (gentle music) I didn't know this was gonna be so romantic. Let's focus. Close your eyes. Open your mind and heart. Are you here? Hannah Granger? What do you wanna tell us? Yeah, I'm gonna need some more wine for this. Okay. Box by the sink. Okay. (foreboding music) (Ava sighs) Hannah, can you please give me a sign? (eerie music) Hello? You're kidding. I'm not doing this. G. U. Yeah, okay. I. L. Ava, you're moving- I'm not! T. Y. "Guilty." Okay. Ava, don't bullshit me. Hannah, who is guilty? Who tried to kill you, Hannah? Hannah? Hannah, who's guilty? Who pushed you off the bridge? Hannah? (tense music) (Ava grunts) God damn it. Hey. Okay, relax. You are taking this shit way too seriously. She didn't kill herself. Somebody killed her. Maybe you should take a break from this place for a while. You know, just go back. To where? I've lost my parents. This is my home now. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) At least that's healing nicely. You had me worried there. You're the only person I know that could drive 200 miles with a busted radiator and one headlight light. You'd tell me if you had superpowers, right? I know I've said this a thousand times, but thank you again for that night. Is anything starting to come back to you? No. It's all kind of a blur. I just really think it happened for a reason. I got up the road, I got my dream cabin, and I met you. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) Oh my God! (eerie music) What? There's somebody there. There's somebody outside. There's somebody there! Okay. All right, just stay here. (ominous music) (crickets chirping) (ominous music continues) Go shoot up somewhere else, asshole! (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (Kellen knocking on door) Hey, it's me. It's all clear. I didn't make that up. I saw somebody right there. I swear. You did say you were seeing Hannah. Here, why don't you just lay down? Just lay down right here. Okay. All right. Hey, I'm gonna stay here while you sleep and keep guard. (gentle music) No ghost is gonna mess with you. Okay.

Hi. What's going on? Come here. I found this under the floorboards. I think it's her jewelry, and, last night, she was trying to contact me using the Ouija board. She's trying to tell me who killed her. Okay. But I need your help. Okay. Just one thing at a time. Huh. This is clear quartz. It's used as protection. She knew somebody was trying to kill her. And the ring is rosewood, which can be used as a spell blocker. Okay. Now split the deck and ask her your question. Who hurt you on the bridge? All right. (mysterious music) The first card pertains to the subject of your question. The Princess. So this card refers to the dominant individual in the situation, and it is a young woman. The next card is gonna pertain to you, the questioner. The Devil? Is that me? Don't take it too literally. These cards are symbolic. Let's move on to the next card. And what's the lesson to be learned? The Moon. It shines light on dark secrets. She's trying to reveal her secret to me. The Eight of Cups. This represents disappointment and abandonment. Yeah. Hannah had enough of both. The Chariot. It represents courage, strength, and determination to move forward, but it's reversed. What does that mean? Is there something that you're running away from? Why are all these about me? I don't control the cards. They show what they show. Okay, the last card. What's to come? (mysterious music) The Hanged Man. And? Traitors used to be hanged upside down as retribution, but it can also mean self-sacrifice as an act of atonement. Okay, so which was it? Did she jump or was she pushed? It's not pointing to either of those. We expected Hannah's spirit to be tied to this cabin, but everything here is telling me that, whatever it is you're sensing, it didn't originate here. No, no, no, because it all started when I moved here. I'm sorry. I'm not getting that from the cards. (ominous music) Do it again. That's not how it works. Do it again. Ava. We have her jewelry. We have to help her. Do it again. Well, we're not even sure that that's Hannah's. Now you don't believe me? I mean, you can't go accusing people of murder. No. You said it. You said the Grangers were rich enough and powerful enough to cover this whole thing up. Yeah, but those are rumors and this is real life, and you need to take a step back. Oh my God. You're covering for them. (Trina scoffs) How much did they pay you? Ava, stop it. Get out. Ava, please. Get the fuck out! (tense music) Fuck!

I'm here to see a patient. Sign in. He said he'd been doing a lot of thinking and had reached a big decision. Did he tell you what that decision was? Paging doctor- Well, he said that what he had decided would change his whole life, and Moira's too. That will be all. Thank you. You're not gonna get much out of Elijah. I just wanna sit with him. Oh, that's nice. Just don't let his face scare you. I mean, you'd think he couldn't miss at that range. What? I mean, you put the gun in your mouth, you can't miss, right? But, see, recoil pulls the gun forward. It blows off half your face and a sizeable chunk of your brain. Just not enough to do the job. Hence, vegetable for life. (somber music) Mr. Granger, guess what? You got a visitor. (eerie music) When you're done or you need anything, just give me a holler, okay? Hi, Elijah. I'm Ava. I wanted to talk to you about your sister. I know it's been a long time since she passed, but... (somber music) (somber music continues) (Elijah groans) Elijah? What was that?

Me and his uncle went to school together. Hm. (ominous music) Are you from the Granger family? That's my name. Yes, but, I mean, are you from the Granger family, like Hannah Granger? Since you're new in town, I am just gonna give you a fix-it ticket. Have a nice day now. (foreboding music) (foreboding music continues) (Ava sighs) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) Ava. What are you doing here? How did you get in? I'm not gonna hurt you, but I know what you did. Let's just talk. I just wanna talk. I just wanna talk to you, Ava. I downloaded your GPS, Ava. (Ava screams) (stranger indistinctly speaking) (Ava screams) (pepper spray hisses) (stranger groaning) (tense music) (Ava grunts) (stranger coughing) (tense music continues) (somber music) (van roars) (engine rumbling) Hey, hey, hey, Ava! Come to save me again? Yeah. Maybe. What are you doing exactly? A stalker broke into my cabin. Ava. Oh, you don't believe me? Maybe the sheriff will! Okay, okay. Are you sure that's what you wanna do? What is that supposed to mean? I'm not judging, Ava, okay? We all make mistakes, but now I'm involved. What are you talking about? All I'm saying is maybe the sheriff is not who you need to be talking to right now, okay? Because he's covering up for Hannah's murder? No. Because your uncle is best friends with the sheriff, who's a Granger like Hannah Granger? You didn't think to tell me that? Okay, Ava, this is not about me, okay? I found something under your van. (ominous music) That's him. See? Okay, listen, I'm gonna take care of this. Go home. (Ava panting) (ominous music) I think we need to talk to her right now, because this is very serious. There you are. Ava. Ava. Honey, how are you doing? Get away from me. Ava. Get away from me! Ava, we need to get you to the hospital. Leave me alone! Stop! Honey, we're just trying to help you. Can you please talk to me? No! Ava, Ava. Don't go! (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) (engines roaring) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) (police siren wails) (foreboding music) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (engines roaring) (suspenseful music) (police siren wailing) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no! You don't understand! Oh, I understand, you son of a bitch! (police siren wailing) (stranger groans) This whole town is against me. Even the sheriff is a Granger! I know how Hannah feels. (object clatters) (Ava gasps) What, you get off on van girls, huh? All right, all right, all right, Kellen. I think you proved your point. (stranger groans) This psycho has been stalking Ava. Is that true? (stranger groans) Oh, you're God damn right. (stranger groans) (ominous music) Hands behind your back. I think I hear something. (ominous music) (Ava panting) (ominous music continues) Go home. I'll handle this. (somber music) (engine rumbling) (sheriff sighs) (object clatters) (mouse chittering) (Ava chuckles) It's just my friend. I mean, we can talk now or you can wait and be questioned back at the station. I've been tracking that evil woman for weeks. Some kind of freak, huh? She killed my daughter. Well, that's some accusation. You got any proof? She's driving around in it. (ominous music) (engine rumbling) (crickets chirping) I'm gonna check it out. Stay put. (ominous music) (sheriff knocking on door) Hello? It's the sheriff. Hello? It's the sheriff! (ominous music) Hello? (ominous music) Hello? (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) Hello? (suspenseful music) Sheriff! Sheriff! No! Sheriff! What? Sheriff, watch out! (Ava grunts) (sheriff groans) (stranger screaming) (tense music) Ava, I've called you like 10 times. I'm coming over. (foreboding music) (drops splashing) (eerie music) (intense music) (Ava screams) (ominous music) What's happening? She's trying to kill me! Who? Her ghost. Come here. (Ava whimpering) Come here. Come here. Come on. Come on. (foreboding music) (Ava panting) No. There's no one here, okay? (Ava huffs) Ava, no, no, no. Listen. No, no. There's nobody out there either, okay? You're just hallucinating. Am I hallucinating this? What is this? It's a clue about Hannah's killer, Elijah. (ominous music) (Ava panting) Hannah's brother! (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (Ava shakily panting) Is that blood? I got him. What did you do, Ava? It was him or us. Who? You told me not to trust him! (ominous music) (sheriff groans) Oh, shit. No! (flesh squelches) (tense music) (Kellen screaming) (foreboding music) (stranger yelps) Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hang on. You hang on. (somber music) (Kellen groans) Keys! Keys. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Ah! (radio beeps) I need help. Sheriff Granger's down. We're at Ava Robbins' place, the first left off of Burnt Mill Road. Is this a joke? Send help now! (sheriff groans) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (Ava gasps) (eerie music) (dramatic music) (Ava shakily panting) (somber music) (somber music continues) What do you want from me? (voice echoing) The truth, which is all I ever wanted! No, no, leave me alone! I can't do this anymore. Stop! Stop! You're gonna kill me. Nobody's trying to kill you. I just want you to remember. Do you remember my daughter? Do you remember Jackie? That's all I need to know. (exciting music) ♪ Back to the beginning ♪ ♪ Heart attack, oh, oh, oh ♪ (solemn music) (radio distantly playing) Just hang tight, princess. The tow truck will be there soon. You okay? You gonna be all right? Seriously, I'm fine, Dad. It's just a flat. It was so worth it. I got to meet Ava Robbins. (Jackie giggles) Ava Robbins. (Jackie chuckles) Dad, I think I see them.

Like, I can't believe I get to call this little place home, and I am so thankful for you guys, my family, to go along on this ride with me. So, from now on, don't call me Van Girl. Call me Cabin Girl. (solemn music) It's called peritraumatic dissociation. It's rare, but it's real. I've never seen anything like it before. Will she eventually be okay? We'll keep her safe here from herself and everyone else, and we'll determine if she can move upstate to stand trial, but I don't know if she'll ever snap out of it. The physical damage to her brain has healed, but who knows how long she'll be trapped in this memory? (solemn music) (solemn music continues) (ominous music) Ava.
