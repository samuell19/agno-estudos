Hold the mail! Shit. Stairs. Hold the mail! Max! Captain wonder, watch out! I'm sorry. I-I got lost after the 99-cent store. What's up with these elevators? They got to be more clearly marked. How are you over there? Max, throw me the lasso! Right. Shifty crackenblau, hold the... Shit. Did I leave it in the car? Well... So long, captain blunder. I got it. I got it! Hurry, Max! It's all right. Got turned around. Okay. I...! It's a nail. Max! I'm okay. I'm okay. All right. Can you guys come a bit closer? Max! That's... it's cool. All right. Hold...the...mail! No. Fuck. I'm all right! I'm okay. Anybody got any ice? A bag of frozen peas? You want to see me, captain? Come in, Max. Close the door. How's your neck? Hard to say. Pretty doped up. How long you been working for me, Max? Oof. Like thir... 18 years. Yeah, I was... I was gonna say 17, so yeah. Off by a year. A lot's changed in that time. It's a fast-paced world now. Got to be sharp to stay ahead, especially in this field. Agreed? How would you rate your performance as of late, Max? Um, I mean... Pretty great. Let's look at the log. Tuesday, January 18th, you let nightlight man get away citing, poor visibility. Yeah, fog rolled in that night. I couldn't see a thing. Nightlight man. Friday, the 11th of December, failed to respond to yet another stress call. Yeah, no, told you, that's verizon's issue. I don't get any service inside the costco. And last night, thanks to your hijinks, yet another renowned criminal got away. Captain, how was I supposed to know shifty crackenblau was back in town? Because last week, I told you, "heads up... Shifty crackenblau is back in town"! Okay, yeah, no, that... That's me. That was on me. Yeah! Who else is it gonna be on, Max? Is it gonna be on me? Professor moncreif? Deb in accounting?! Mr. Tickles?! No, I mean, yeah. Me. Me. Max, I think it's time. Time, sir? We had a good run. But we're the captain and Max. We're just the captain now. You know who's to blame for this? The icloud. Lightning, what does that got to do with anything? Sidekicks are a dying breed, okay? We have no relevance in this digital age. Everything's being loaded up on some fucking cloud, whatever the fuck that means. Well, it means... I'll tell you what it means. Okay. I have saved the world over 500 times. What am I doing now, Max? Children's parties. Children's parties, Max. Like I'm a fucking clown. Just we're getting old, is all. No, it's different for you, sidecar Willy. You just ride shotgun for a living. That's all you do. Yeah. At speeds upwards of 850 miles per hour, jerkface. Jerkface? What? You want to go for a ride? Okay, you know I fractured my pelvis over the rockies in 2007 when that jetpack failed. You know that shit is true! I couldn't even look at a bicycle, let alone a fucking jetpack, so fuck you, you road warrior-looking ass. Back... hey, back up off me. Back... what are you gonna do? Hey. Hey. You know what I mean? That was too much. Just step down. It's fine. Fine. Come on. Sidecar's right. You know, we're not kids anymore. That's just the way that it is. Max, you have the best catchphrases in all of the west. Okay? That's fact. That's a fact. We're a dying breed, man. We are a dying breed. Are you kidding me?! God damn it. Every time, my cape shrinks! Look at this shit! You can't put that in the tumble cycle, man. Seriously, man, I can't hear you, sidecar. I can't hear it. If we weren't off the clock, I'd kick your ass. Well, well, well. What do you want, Jimmy t.? I just came by to offer my condolences. Not a big deal, man. It was mutual, actually. Yeah? Yeah, yeah. The relationship had run its course, so... Still, it's got to be rough to be replaced so quickly. What? Whoopsie-Daisy. Wait, what do you mean, replaced? Captain's already got himself a new partner. Fresh out of school. Word is he's got mad skills. Pardon me. It's the boss man. I got to bolt. Hey, Max, sorry to break the news. But look, you had a good run. Slater, gators. "Slater, gators"? That's not a catchphrase. Douchebag. It's the dumbest catchphrase I ever heard, you dickhead! What is this? 1999? Look out! "Closed" call. You still got it, Max McCabe. Yeah. But what do I do with it? All right. So, extra towels are in the closet. Okay. And, here's the bathroom right there. If it's yellow, let it mellow. Boss likes to conserve. Okay. All right? If you find yourself in the pit of snakes for some reason, just, no sudden moves. Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna need to... Okay, okay, okay. It's just gonna be for a few days. Boss is out of town, so... All right. Thanks, sidecar. You know, do you know anybody who's, like, looking for a sidekick or...? You'll figure it out, Max. Yeah. You're always good at figuring it out. Yeah. I do. All right. All right. I'll leave you alone. Okay. Thanks, buddy. You want this shut? Yeah, you can shut it. Give you some privacy. Okay. Yeah. Mars, unlike earth, may have a solid core. Tracking stations up... Impressive takedown tonight, captain wonder. Well, really, all credit for this one goes to kid loco here. If he hadn't thought to build that road block on the bridge, we'd have lost this one. Hey, captain, I was just doing my duty. Sounds like you went over and beyond the call of duty. This is Jackie Hernandez, khro. [ Electricity crackles, [ television shuts off ] Â™ª there's a hole in the road â™ª â™ª and a cone on the hole â™ª â™ª there's a fact changing hands â™ª â™ª and a man with no master plan â™ª â™ª maybe there's a place where I'm just another fool â™ª â™ª maybe I'm a lot like you â™ª Â™ª there's a stitch in my hand â™ª â™ª and it's switching the thread â™ª â™ª there's a hitch in my step â™ª â™ª when the light is left on red â™ª â™ª maybe there's a place where I'm just another fool â™ª â™ª maybe I'm a lot like you â™ª â™ª maybe I'm a lot like you â™ª This... this eat-a-mame salad, that looks good. Um, I think it's pronounced "edamame." Thanks for meeting with me. I really liked what I read about you. Bombs and defusing them has always been something I've been interested in, so... I-I've never done this before, so I'm not quite even sure... do I tell you about myself, or...? I-I have almost 20 years of experience. Um, I got fast hands. Um, my use of wit is expert without being heavy handed. My specialty, though, is catchphrases. So... I don't know if you know "hold the mail." That's... that's mine. You're gonna have to speak up a bit, son. Did you get any of that, or do you need me to start from the top? I'm sorry. Who are you with again? Okay, um... Look, you defuse bombs. I say, "look out! Don't touch that!" We'd make a good team. So...are you looking for a sidekick? Yeah, always looking for sidekicks. Yeah, no, it's just... it's just tough to keep them alive, though. Except for no-hands Larry, but... That's no kind of life. It hurts. Here. I got it, stretch. There you go. Dear. I did it again. That's all right. Sorry. I'm a klutz. That's... thank you. I could use someone like you. Yeah? What kind of crime-fighting are you doing these days, stretch? Um, not... not so much these days, to be honest, 'cause these tendons, they... they're shot to hell from all the stretching. Good rubdowns is what I like. What kind of hands do you have? Fast. Yeah. Real fast. Yeah? Yeah. I like that. I like that a lot. So, you know, I've never done the villain thing before. Or villainess. I don't know what, you normally like to go by. But, I mean, I could... I'll roll with... you know, the way I look at it, it's like psychic... Quiet! Sorry. You talk too much. I can adapt. Can you snap man's neck to take gold off his back? I'm sorry, why would he have gold on his back? You're fired! Was I hired? Last one? All you. I insist. Well, lucky Lance. I have to say, this has exceeded my expectations. I concur. Very good. Well, then, you know what? Let's give this a go. I am ready to be your sidekick. I'mthe sidekick. What? No, the... the... the website had you listed as a hero. Crap. I've told them like 20 times. They keep doing that. I thoughtyouwere a hero. I'm not a hero. I'm a sidekick. Well, we should go. Yeah. After you. No, I insist. Please, lead the way. No, I... really. I... please, go. I'll follow. I'm on your cape. Hey, listen, I'm your guy, all right? More wasabi! Okay spread, you know? Dig in. So, you find everything okay, Max? Yeah, sidecar. Great. Thanks. Couch is comfy enough for you? Yeah. Surprisingly so. Perfect. Yeah. And I'm gonna need you gone tomorrow. Say what? Boss man's coming home early, and, you know what he does to house guests. No, actually. I don't know what evil k. Does to house guests. He burns them alive. No, seriously, he burns them alive. All right. I'm outie. Open or closed? Yeah, closed. Closed. God. Excuse me. Jesus. Big guy. Give me a heads up next time. You have a cigarette? Call me. This place is going off tonight, whoa, whoa, Max, I got a list. When have I ever needed to be on a list? Green cape, good to see you. I'm not good to see you! Green cape... you let green cape in? Guy saves one train full of people, suddenly he's v.I.P.? Whoo! It's crazy. This place blows. Let's take this party elsewhere, come on! Who's with me? You lost, old man? If it isn't the new boy wonder. Isn't it past your bedtime? I could eat you for lunch, esã©. Eat me for lunch. Bring it, punk. That's enough, Max. I got this under control, captain. I know you do, kid. Isn't this sweet? Don't they make a cute couple? Come on. Let's give it up for the bride and groom, ladies and gentleman. What in god's name are you doing, Max? Look at you. You're a disgrace to yourself, and you're a disgrace to the good name of supers. Hey, I'm off duty, permanently, remember? Captain, there's a fire on 7th. Let's ride! Whoa, whoa, whoa. "Let's ride"? What happened to "row with me"? Loco came up with it, and it's really taken off. Listen, take care of yourself, Max. Let's ride! I don't like it! I'm just being honest. Now I'm the bad guy. Hold the mail. Ma'am, look out! No! Hey, stop! Now! No! Hey, hey. What? Blood diamond? Max McCabe? That's crazy. What's going on, man? You know, working it, working it. Sorry about what happened. We all heard about it, man. I just wanted you to know, nobody in the villain community really feels good about the way that all went down. Thanks, man. You know, it happens. Yeah, but it shouldn't happen to you, honestly. Yeah. You're one of the "good" good guys, you know? You're just saying that 'cause I let you go all the time. Absolutely. Yeah. I thought I saw you the other day robbing an old lady outside of Mel's liquors. Was that... No. This is my park. Right on. Okay. You good otherwise? Everybody good? You know, not easy being a pimp. Yeah. Yeah. But I try. Hope you're good, man. All right. You, too, bro. I can't. It's against my code. Hah! Aah! Sorry, man. I'm on the clock, you understand? It's cool. Blood diamond. Son of a bitch. Ma'am, you... you okay? Does it look like I'm okay? No. The world is against me. I'm not okay. Well, it's okay. He's... he's gone now, so... He broke my bag. It sucks. Well, you... you can get another bag like that, maybe. I've seen those at... at target. Um, and also, t.J.Maxx. Why are you making fun of my bag right now? I'm not. Why would you do that? No, I'm... I'm not. I thought those were good bag places. You know, it's funny, actually. I think I know you. You're a teacher at dillweed elementary? Yeah. Yeah. I am. Are you a parent there? No. No. I just... I watched you. I mean, I-I-I saw you... I saw the kids through the fence, and I saw you... You saw the kids through the fence? You watched them through the... No, no, no. I-I... actually, ma'am, I'm a very upstanding person. You're in good hands with me. What is that smell? I barfed on my shoes. Do you like it? I don't think I'm appreciating it as much as you want me to be. Well, keep on it. It always cheers me up. This cheers you up? Yeah. Cinnamon sugar sticks cheer you up? Um, yes. And p.S., it's called a churro. A churro? Okay. Well, I don't think anything's gonna work anyway. Sorry. It's all right. It's not doing it for me, either. Okay, I have to ask you, what's going on with the outfit, the cape and everything? Yeah, um, I'm a sidekick. Like a... What's that thing? Is that a saxophone? A saxophone, yeah. Like a sideman? Yeah, that's what... like, in a jazz band? No, no. Costumes or... no? No, not in a costume jazz band. No, like, I assist superheros. That sounds like a very thankless job, actually. No, it actually is pretty awesome. It's everything I ever wanted to be. That's cool. It's just... I don't know. It feels like there's not a ton of, I don't know, upward mobility in your profession. I mean, didn't you want to be the main guy ever, the superhero? I don't know. Haven't thought about it. Hey, you want to see something cool? Okay. One time, me and the captain, we, like, saved this greyhound from an overturned gas rigger, and then we, um, got ice cream right, right there, right across from the sears. Okay. And then we took the chopper up to this Ridge right over there, and we, we just, like, you know, took in the city. We had a really good thing. I think there are people down there. What? I don't think you should throw rocks down there. Sorry. Asshole! Put this down. You said youhada good thing? You're not doing it anymore? Um, no, yeah. No, we split up. But, you know, it was mutual. It was like a mutual thing. No, it wasn't mutual. I fucked up. Sorry. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise. How so? Well, I think even though I just met you... I think that maybe you're ready to do something new. I'm not qualified to do anything else. Like, you know, I can say, "look out!", you know, "get in!" "Here, catch!" You know, I'm, like, a 40-year-old ex-professional buddy. Who wants that guy? Watch out! Heads up! Don't touch that! Look out! Have a ball. All right, guys, come on. Let's bring it in. Someone nearly got hurt just now. We're gonna talk ball etiquette. Bring it on in. Max McCabe, you got a visitor in the front office. Max McCabe. So, what brings you here? Trouble? No, I was just in the neighborhood. There was a chemical spill. I was on the way back, and, I heard you were working here. Thought I'd stop by. That's really nice of you, captain. Thank you. You look healthy, Max. You're moving with purpose, like the old days. Yeah, I have to say, I feel good. Yeah. Yeah. You know... Nah, I just... I don't know. What? I was just thinking, maybe we should team up again, Max. Are you offering me my job back? Well, weare the captain and Max. What about kid loco? He got a better offer. A spot opened up with the significant eight. Wow. Wait, I thought they were seven. They're eight now. Wow, captain, i-i... I don't know what to say. The lair misses you, Max. Deb in accounting misses you. Professor moncreif... he doesn't miss you. Imiss you, Max. Hi. Hey. Bailey, this is captain wonder. Ma'am. Wow, this is he. Him. This is him. I've heard a lot about you. I'm sure you have. What do you say, Max? Thanks, captain, but i-i think I'm good here. Well, I'm sure you have good reason. Yeah, I think so. Well, fair enough, Max. Fair enough. Let's ride! What... That doesn't really... No, I got to... I got to tweak that. Yeah. Okay. All right, well, bye. Yeah. Bye. Bye. Nice to meet you. Wowie. Real-life superhero. Yep. He's pretty remarkable. No, I wasn't talking about him. I was talking about you. Wow. See? Did you think of that all by yourself? I did just now. Wow. Just came to me. That's amazing. Thanks. I don't know how you do it. I feel pretty good about it. You should. I feel good about it, too. Okay, good. Mission accomplished.
