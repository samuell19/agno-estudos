THE TWENTIES... THE THIRTIES... Pull it up higher! Over here. Done! Damn it! Sir! - What is it, Mr Pyzdra? - We found something! Here’s a sample from the drill hole. I told you it was here! Adam! We found oil! - Oil? - Yes! It does look like oil! What is it? It could be a coincidence. What? A coincidence? You said yourself, in this geological layout... I said there is a slight possibility - of finding oil, yes. - Then why are you still here? - Wasting time and money? - Because I don’t have the money! I can lend you some! Firstly, I don’t accept loans from young ladies, secondly, it’s not your money, but your father’s, and thirdly, it’s all just a game for you. A game? A game! Why am I even trying to explain this to you? Then why won’t you take the money from that bank account? Because it’s not my money, but the partners’. - You have the power of attorney! - But without consulting them... - Ask their permission! - I can’t! I promised that I would only use the money if I found oil. I gave my word. Besides, it’s none of your business. It is my business, too! I want to send a telegram. To Mr Maksymilian Fuks and Jan Krzyżtoporski, Warsaw, Różana Street 10. Found oil, send the American drills and the drill bit ZM-452 post-haste. Signed: Adam Dereń. Thank you. They’ll be sending anything you might need now. - But we haven’t found oil yet. - But they don’t know that. What if they come? Then we’ll show them oil. Mr Pyzdra, everything has been calculated. If you start the pump at the right moment, the pressure will force the liquid out up to 12 to 15 meters high... I understand. And tell them it’s the best oil ever found - in this part of Europe. - Of course, I’ll tell them that. - Thank you very much. - Thank you, goodbye. Goodbye! I’m worried about one thing. He said he wouldn’t touch even a penny until he found that oil. And he didn’t! That’s what worries me. You know what the next step of a crook will be. But an honest person... - Is it far from here? - Around 5 km. - And how much is “around”? - Around another 5. Quite the spot you’ve found. If only it were closer to Warsaw! Konstancin... Maybe Podkowa Leśna, Sochaczew at furthest. This operation could make us really rich. As rich as Sochaczew. Our engineer is a genius! People from the Polytechnic said so. Let geniuses work for the competition, I only need a specialist! I guess we’ll see. Thank you, gentlemen. Mikołaj, thank your father and give him my best regards. Thank you, goodbye, Miss. They’re here. What are you doing?! Mr Adam should definitely have a wife like you. I was thinking the same thing myself. - Gentlemen. - Adam, stop that. Always talking about those boring American drills. Now that you mention it, we have a surprise for you. Where are the drills? That’s the surprise: we didn’t bring them. We had a deal. You sent us a telegram saying that you found oil. - We did. - Where? We did! Then there’s no need to use the American drills, then. They’re indispensible. Indispensible to find more oil. We’ll see about that after this one runs dry. Oh! That’s dirty. I’ve been looking for a whole year, sacrificing myself, - cold and permanently exhausted... - Thanks to our money. Your money, your site, your junk, useful maybe for digging holes 3 meters deep to access groundwater! There’s oil! We did it! We’ll see about that. In 5 minutes you’ll get your money, and in 10 I’ll state my terms. - You? - Me. Is this the oil? - He found the best kind of... - Well done, Mr Pyzdra, well done. Put out that cigarette! Oh, Christ! Mr Pyzdra, why isn’t it burning? You crook! We’ll be together forever. - What’s wrong? - It’s over. Why isn’t it burning?! Be seeing you, Marta. Adam! Adam! Jaś, look, he’s escaping! - What’s going on? - Get him! - He’s escaping! - Grab him! Get that bastard! “Genius”, you said. I told you he’s a rogue, a bandit! We’ll take this to a prosecutor. You broke my heart in half, And now you’re wearing it For show on your sleeve And I still dream of you. Though I know very well, You only cheated, lied, deceived! Day and night, I’m pulled to your distanced facade, Don’t pull me in, Don’t tempt me for naught, Without you my nights Are even darker. My nights are now as empty As a November walk in a park. My days, my lonely lips... - Come here, pretty lady! - Let go of me! Whore! - You pig! You bastard! - Whore! You... I hate you! I hate you all! Like I’d let you insult my clients. You’re finished at “Kaskada”, your career’s over. And I’m taking this. For the monetary losses you’ve caused. You won’t be finding another job anywhere in the city! Goddamn it all. What are you staring at? Get to work! - Here, get in. - Thank you. - I’m headed to Warsaw. - Wonderful, so am I! My car broke down, you know. You’re going to a screen test, then? Yes, but it’s more of a formality. Misha can’t imagine anyone else in that role. - Misha? - Waszyński! He’s a famous director. - I see. - You haven’t heard of him? - “The Cult of the Body”, “Sinful love”? - I don’t go to the movies often. - Don’t you like movies? - I don’t have the time. That’s just the life of an oilman, the search for oil is all you ever do. But it can be pretty exciting at times. The possibility of finding it... Or not... Did you find it? I did. But I’m taking a step back and going to America. - What will you do there? - I’ll make more money! Will this be your first role? I did some acting in a theatre, the cabaret, I’m... I danced and I singed... You said you’re going to America? - We finally made it to Warsaw. - Warsaw... Did you get the money? Thank you for lending me your suitcase. Let me invite you to dinner. I actually should be... No, let’s go. I thought so. Good evening. I wish you a pleasant evening. Mr Adam! - Mr Adam! - Excuse me. - Did my husband arrive with you? - Mr Fuks? He should have arrived in Warsaw yesterday. He left together with Mr Krzyżtoporskim on the train at 4. Jan hasn’t shown up, either. I talked to Klara an hour ago, - she said he’s not home yet. - Unfortunately, I don’t know anything. I have to let Klara know, then. This is the first time that our husbands are seemingly hiding from us. I’m sure something just stopped them. That “something” is exactly what I fear the most. - And this red meat. - Here. - And the pate. - Hare pate. - And the red one, too. - Salami. And this, and this, too. - And this, and this. - And this? Adam? Excuse me. I behaved outrageously yesterday. I’m really sorry. Don’t worry, it could happen to anyone. You’re wonderful. I just worry about one thing. That you’re about to remember all your previous engagements, your career... Did I say something wrong, Liza? It’s not you, it’s me... I’m very unlucky. Always have been. I lied to you. I didn’t come here to act at all, I was just a singer at some diner. And they fired me. I’m sure you can find someplace to work around here... All the revue’s and cabaret’s are going under. Girls better than me ended up on the streets. I tell you, you’ll be a star yet. No. I’m nothing. Just a nobody. You, you’re something else. You have your money, your oil... You’re going to America. Liza, listen to me. It’s not exactly like that. I didn’t tell you the whole truth, either. And that’s why I have to make them pay. - What about the money? - That’s my revenge. No matter what becomes of me, I’ll ruin those bastards, I’ll have them end up in utter ruin. I’ll make them live through something they’ll never forget. I just need to invest this money in a business destined to fail. „Warsaw Courier”, latest edition! Murder on set! It doesn’t make a difference If the pain in my voice moves you, Who cares about my fate, Who cares about me. Nobody cares at all About the pain of my soul, And the fact that our feelings Became volcanic dust. No one cares That although we’re young In a silver boat to the Moon There is no space left for us. - It’s true, no one seems to care. - Don’t say that. - You like this place? - Yes. Really? No one cares That although we’re young In a silver boat to the Moon There is no space left for us. I asked if you liked it here. I do. The stage is big, and so is the audience. But they’re not doing well. I don’t think they can keep this place going for much longer. Will they go bankrupt? Yes. I think they will. You saw it yourself. Nobody wants to come to these shows anymore. One row filled! Mr Director, you have your job, I have mine. - We’ll take over what we have to, and... - I knew this would happen. I knew I would end up putting my trousers on the line! Speaking of, I had to take possession of your fur. Wait here, darling. The municipal tax must be paid when you don’t have money. - Good evening, gentlemen. - Who’s this? Two on one? That’s just un-Polish like! It’s a discgrace! Dishonour! Tell your bosses that I’ll pay when I have the money! Excuse me... I want to buy this theatre. Put 1 and 3 all the way down! Hurry it up, guys! And fix the curtain, there’s a gap! - Where’s that painter? Wiśniewski! - I’m coming! - Where’s that pipe? - I’m coming, I’m coming! I told you to put your back into it! My partners and I, all of us oilmen, have considered investing in a place like this for a while now. - Oilmen, you say? - Indeed. But art is everything to us. Who cares about oil? - Let’s get down to business. - I’ll leave you gentlemen to it. The owners of this theatre will be Maksymilian Fuks, Jan Krzyżtoporski - i myself, Adam Dereń. - Yes, sir. I bought this place. You did what? Why? To bankrupt! What a surprise meeting, how are you? I haven’t heard from you, haven’t seen you, you never call me anymore! - Who are you, what are you saying? - I’m already acting, are you surprised? I’m an unappreciated artist. And underpayed, too. There’s lies and plots and schemes everywhere, sir. When the river Bziebzia, no, Biebrza, overflowed, everyone immediately blamed on me. Hail in May? Me, again! Economic recession - who’s to blame? Not our dear prime minister, no - ‘twas my doing. If Vesuvius was to erupt tomorrow, will it be my fault, too?! - Madam, please... - No, it’s fine, I’ll bear anything. Only one thing has to change. Mr Director... I’m extremely talented, so I demand to have a solo in the show. But not a solo for just a murmur, a small “clappy clappy” from the audience, but thunder! Brahmaputra, insanity! And Sodom! And Gomorrah! Brava! - I’m begging you, madam! - I understand, we have a deal, then. You go lie, and I shall leave. And not another word from me. What a start. Here comes that daredevil, the so-called Adam Dereń. You know that guy? He’s the man who bought theatre “Mirage” from me! - He looks pretty normal! - Doesn’t he? Mr Director, I know a thing or two about this business. This is going to be a total failure. Maybe he’s just optimistic, hoping to see another “Miracle on the Vistula”! - Mr Dereń? - That’s right. You’re wearing your xx, like you said. I’d recognise you without any help. Our star! Go on, now. - Excuse me? - To the point. I mentioned to you on the phone that I came to own a theatre. Get to the point, to the point. - It’s my great dream to... - I know all that. The point. At “Warsaw’s Smile” theatre - you’re being paid 6000 zlotys. - Why should you care about that? I’ll offer you 8 if you work for me at “Mirage” instead. Eight? I need to talk to my boss. Excuse me. Zelski offered me 9, so, unfortunately... Ten. If you’d give me just a second. - He’s offering 10 thuosand. - How much?! At what interest rate?! That’s impossible. Zelski said 11. Then I’m offering 12. I need to consult my boss, excuse me. - The gall. - That much money... This is outrageous. - Done. I’m coming to work for you. - That’s good to hear. You should try and hire Frederic. But since the Phoenicians invented money, Frederic thinks they didn’t invent enough of it. I was thinking about him. But we oilmen are a generous bunch. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Do you know what you just did?! This is an upset. - You’re shameless! - You’ll go bankrupt in no time! I dream of nothing else. Remember: stay vigilant and don’t let him get a word in. Who do you think I am? Come on. Mr Dereń, excuse us, but we have to talk. And there’s a lot to talk about. Gentlemen, you’re not artists? With such dramatic potential? - But we are not discussing this. - That’s right. Sorry, darling, you’re going to have to give us the room. These men are the partners I mentioned. You broke my heart in half! Go on. - You embezzled our money. - Nothing of the sort. You ran, you led us on, and made it impossible to contact Warsaw. You stole our money to spend it with this lady-friend of yours. Indeed, I took out a greater sum of money, because I was faced with a business opportunity I couldn’t refuse. Business opportunity? No more businesses with you! Take a look. Show me. - “Mirage”. - What’s this “Mirage”? What’s this “Mirage”?! You just became theatre owners, gentlemen. You’ve lost your mind! Give us our money back... - Or we’ll take this to court! - We’ll call the police! The prosecution! I wouldn’t do that if I were you. That was the idea behind all this, to keep your role as partners a secret from the outside parties, especially the revenue service. We demand you sell this venue immediately. - We demand it! - But who would buy it? To sell it with interest we must invest it it, keep it running until the opening night. Invest in it? Who does he think we are? This will be the deal of a lifetime. Keep putting money in it, if you want to avoid loss. Is he blackmailing us? We thought you were better than this. I thought the same thing about you gentlemen. Unfortunately, we’ve all been proven wrong. So you’re saying, to get something out, we have to put something in? And we’ll earn? And we’ll earn? If we hire the best performers, then maybe... - We could still go to court... - I told you that’s not an option. But we know nothing about running a theatre! I’ll take that upon myself, besides, I’ll have the help of Miss Liza, who’s a professional in the cabaret business. All of Rzeszów was crazy about her. - All of Rzeszów, huh? - All of it, huh? Let’s begin. Mietek, bring that microphone closer. Silence, sound test starting. Tomek, the jingles, here you go.. You’ll be the horse leading the sled. - Sled test, go! - Come on! Alright, alright. Stop, stop, stop! You’re holding it wrong, you have to keep it in the airflow! Dear Lord. - Not like that! - Come on, already. Stop, stop, camera, stop! More snow, gentlemen, way more! - Excuse me, could I get your autograph? - An autograph? - Here you go. - Thank you. Do you at least know what you signed? You’re too pretty to be a blackmailer, Miss. I see, so I just joined a great show. Wonderful! Have a seat. Milena mentioned, a certain “Mr De-reń”... - Mr Adam Dereń, he’s my... Yes, yes. There’s always some guy like that. - Who are you? - I was a dancer. - Where? - Not worth mentioning. But you don’t plan on continuing down that career path. - Mr Frederic, we can keep going. - What for, Hanka isn’t even here yet. She should be here any minute. For the time being you could take her place. Come along. Lower it, lower! Would you help me? You’ve launched all of Warsaw’s greatest stars’ careers. That’s not true. - But will you help me? - No. You think I don’t have what it takes? Oh, I don’t doubt that for a second. but I don’t intend on being a stepping stone in your career. I don’t quite understand. Do you want to hear a psycholo... Frederic, after the cut you put your arm around Hanka. ...psychological story I wrote? It goes like this: “Darling, would you like to be my wife?”, asks he. “No”, replies she. And they live happily ever after. The end! Camera! We’re rolling. Excuse me. I will become a star. Hanka, get in the sled. - Sled ready? - Ready. Faster, faster! Refill the snow. You’re going 50 the whole time, parallel to them, keep the focus, then the actor enters the shot, passes behind the sled. Who was that? That snot-nosed little thing? Another day, another small-town girl dreaming of making a career. You were just like that, Hanka. I heard you signed a deal to be a part of some show. You’ll be breaking that deal. That idiot director should know that you never perform without me. Enough business talk. We’re filming. Prepare the snow, on your marks. - Camera! - “Lost love”! - That’s too much snow. - Way too much. Well? Did he agree? Frederic... He agreed. But you have to get Hanka, too. She’ll agree as well. But only if you pay her just as much. That’s wonderful news! We’ll spend a fortune just on actor fees. I’m sure that now... we’ll go bankrupt. Some man is here asking to see you! Excuse me, Mr Director... But, indeed, I tried my best... I tried to meet you, indeed, for the longest time... But, indeed, the business I have is something that can’t wait. Indeed, Mr Director, I heard you recently purchased a theatre, - indeed. - What?! A theatre, indeed. Yes, you did, Jaś. “Mirage”, wasn’t it? Why won’t you just admit it? - I want to see girls performing! - Quiet! “Mirage”? That tiny place? Any time something interesting happens in this house, I’m always the last to be notified. Thus, in relation to the aforementioned purchase, indeed I present you with an opportunity of a lifetime. Wouldn’t you buy a circus? - First rate circus! - Yes! Lions, tigers, horses... Out! Out with you, you... - But, sir! - Get out! Unbelievable! Birdbrained fool! Buying a theatre! You think you’re Szyfman to own a theatre?! They sacked better directors than you! I know exactly what’s behind all this! Theatre, actresses, ballerinas, singers... Graciella, go to your room. - But... - But what?! I married Rasputin! - Me?! Rasputin?! - You know what I mean! I’ve knew this would happen eventually. How do you see our future, now? I don’t! The future is bleak! Black? Did you say black?! I knew it. He’s seeing a brunette. What? Never trust a word he says! - What is this, Frederic? - A theatre, Hania. Theatre? You call this barn a theatre? I don’t think anything could be performed here. No intimacy, no mood in this place at all, how could anyone enjoy it? Give me a break. Cabarets haven’t been very popular lately. This economic recession negatively influences the turnout... You think I’ll fail? Depends on the show itself. I don’t know anything about preparing a show that at all. I’m new to this business, you see. Then you have the best chance to fail, yes. - Oh, God. - What’s wrong? God, I’m sorry. Oh, Lord. I thought that was a peacock. - A peacock? Where? - There, in the arch. I’d never sign the deal in that case. You know, Hanka would never perform in a theatre that had a peacock anywhere on the venue. It’s an old superstition. I’m relieved to hear that. I give you my word: no peacocks in my theatre. Very well. In that case... Well. I’ll sign. I’ll be waiting outside, Frederic. See you tonight, as usual. Bye! But returning to the matter of directing a show... I can help you understand. How to write an entertainment show Good sir, There’s a simple way To do just that. I simply know nothing About all that! Please, reveal the secrets Of your trade. You’re really new to this, Are you not? To create a show to remember You’ll need this: - Three monologues, eight tangos... - I’ll write it down. Two sketches, a hundred jokes On varying topics, But the most vital thing... But the most vital thing Is this: Stairs, stairs, stairs, stairs, Like at Casino de Paris... Stairs are never going out of style, The audience dreams of seeing them! Stairs, stairs, stairs, stairs, Like you’d see in Hollywood, Stairs are never Going out of style, Stairs are here to stay! Doesn’t matter where you’re from, Even a hermit in the wild Seeing stairs full of girls, Would exclaim and ask for more! Ask for more, ask for more ask for more! Stairs, stairs, stairs, stairs, Like at Casino de Paris... Stairs are never going out of style, The audience dreams of seeing them! Stairs, stairs, stairs, stairs, Like you’d see in Hollywood, Stairs are never going out of style, Stairs are here to stay! For the audience to go wild And stare in awe, You’ll not only need your quill, But also feathers on the rear! Without stairs, kind sir, There is no chance! Dully noted, I’ll go buy Some stairs today! Stairs, stairs, stairs, stairs... Stairs, stairs, stairs, stairs... - Stairs, stairs, stairs, stairs. - Like at Casino de Paris... Stairs are never going out of style, Stairs are here to stay! Stairs are never Going out of style, - They’re the oldest... - The greatest... - The greatest... - The oldest... Fashion of all! Lizawieta... Come in. Take off your coat. Get off, Little Mouse... Lizawieta... You’re not quite there yet. The first part will be conservative, some stairs, decorations, a ladder here, lights over here, but the second part, the final! - A hurricane of light, stairs... - How much? - It’s very expensive, because... - How much?! Around 30 thousand... - Just the assembly would cost you... - How much?! 25 thousand, all services included. - Very well. - It’s a difficult job, you need the best of the best, and only then you can hope to achieve the best effects. Take a look at this fabric. What a fabric it is! - How much? - I’m not going to haggle with you. You’ll be thanking me for this fabric yet! - How much? - Altogether: 1700 zlotys. So, 35 all in all. Very well. Now, for the designs of the soloists’ outfits. Very nice. How much? They look expensive. How much? Around 10 thousand. Excuse me. - And you are...? - Madam Aniela. But why are you here? I’m here about my solo. Not now, ma’am! We’re not skimping on anything. We need the outfits to be elegant and well-made. Another expense! At least this one makes sense. Only we’re still falling into a void. And it’s a void we treated ourselves to. “A genius”! I just wanted a specialist! Down, down, down! Up! Aim for the kidneys! - I already told him. - He agreed. Of course, since I told him to. But we need you to keep this between us. No one can ever hear any of this. Grzesio would die before he’d say anything. Grzesio! Good boy! More shy than a young lady. Isn’t that right, Grzesio? Where is... Madam Aniela? I’m here! Here you go. I got it. Written by the author. For you. - Thank you. - You’re welcome. But... it’s a monologue! I’d prefer a dialogue. - Wouldn’t everyone. - Why am I stuck with a monologue? I’m sorry, that’s just the way the show was written. “Spring. Winter, still. A long train made of puffy snow! And I’m already dreaming of spring...” What a weird and mysterious power spring has. It makes everything grow and climb up. The farmer fertilizes his lands, according to the Polish Radio’s pointers... What is this? That’s the monologue we bought from Tuwim. In Warsaw, too, bloom springtime flowers, chrysanthemums, chrysanthedads, anemies- anemones... When the trees leaf out, women peel out of their clothes, and all the living creatures just want to make love! Misters with the Missuses, pigeons with the doves, cars with carriages, the salt and pepper shakers, and the button with the hole! Eveything that lives and once lived, starts to thrive... A phonecall for you, Director. - Who is it? - A Ms Rozbicka. I’m not here. Tell the secretary that if she calls again I’m gone, absent, I’ve left the country, I died, do you understand? I understand. I’ll tell her you told me you’re not here. ...and let’s reproduce, to quote a poet: Hey, a Polish man and woman... Director, it’s only my first rehearsal. Later I’ll put feeling into it and really give it my all! If anyone asks for me, I’ll be back in an hour. Yes, sir. - Who did you want to see? - The director. He’s out right now. Where is he?! Where’s the director?! And four! And five! And... Higher! He’s late. Excuse me. What is it staring at? Get in line! - Is it scared? - Me? Good outfit, perfect for the number we’re about to rehearse. - The lines. - And two pirouettes at the end. Watch the steps. Heel, toe, heel, and toe, and a polka, and a polka! Attention! “Apaszowski”! Let’s begin! One, two, and...! We’re from the other side of Vistula. Just next door, We have our style and our ways... What, can’t it read?! From the top! We’re from the other side of Vistula. Just next door, We have our style and our ways. Old sneakers, flat caps, And a fringe on our necks, No Warsaw wimp can ever Best us at that! Just stop pretending, come to Praga district! Just bring some bandaids and a baseball bat, A klutz won’t fare well in that zone, You don’t want to tempt the fates! Pretty good! It’s not that bad, it’s quite alright, Maybe a jab To the ribs, to the neck, So bring your flag and your courage, Meet me at Praga district amusement park! Now, the pirouette! And... One, two, three, four! He’s making us buy all these promissory notes. Let him get in debt on his own, not at our expense. He know that each of these notes prophesises ruins, thank you very much. The ruin of our, thank you very much, “Pol-oil”. Thank you very much, sir. Lewicki thinks the show will end up a total disaster. Too many stars, too much ambition, too many places to fill. He’s coming! That Grzesio of his is our last hope... What have you done to my best boy! He could have been a champion! His fist was like dynamite! - He had the will! - Keep it down... Keep it down?! He was the real deal, and now... What are you saying, what happened? Don’t play games with me! You know exactly what happened! My Grzesio joined that show of yours as a dancer! Good for him! - We wasted months of trainings! - Mr Maks... Couldn’t you get into a proper business for once? Before it was showgirls, now - boxing... Do you want to bring shame to our voivodeship? Absolutely not! Never! Wouldn’t dream of it! Let’s get out of here. Where are you going? Who’s going to pay me for my loss?! - We’ll pay you... - You made a boxer into a dancer! - Security! Keep your hands off of Fuks! - Hands off! But... Dear Lord! Thank you very much! Hello, little one! So you want to learn from singing me? This is how you do it. Listen. Good breath control makes a real artist. Will you teach me how to do that? Naturally. Although real artistry is no longer valued in today’s world. It used to be completely different, little one. I sang in Vienna... the Archduke gifted me a diamond the size of a chicken’s egg! Always free, always shy, Amongst fun and joy... Excuse me, but... - Could we begin our lesson? - Of course. Now, sing. I’ve been meaning to talk to you for quite a while now. You’ve been avoiding me. Are you absoloutely convinced that you don’t want to take part in the show? Yes, I’m sure. That time at the studio, you seemed... Honest in your outburst. That was a long time ago. You don’t like me much, I don’t think. Could you stop here? Thank you for dropping me off. - Hello, professor. - Lizawieta. - Professor! - Take off your coat. I’m sorry, Little Mouse. Lizawieta... Yes! Wonderful! Thank you very much, ladies, now, the “Volcano” duet. “Volcano” duet. Have you seen today’s news Already? It’s almost too scary To think of what comes next. I don’t have the time To read much, unfortunately. The economy’s in shambles! - Bankruptcy! - Come on! A huge amount! Inflation, impotence, and so on... What to do, wait it out? A step backwards, And two ahead... We’re dancing on a volcano, Dancing on a volcano, A void beneath our feet, So we just think: We’re dancing on a volcano, Trusting that this volcano Was “Made in Poland” And has no lava inside! Did you hear about the unavoidable marriage crisis? Boy and Krzywicka tell us to be aware of life. I know when I look at my wife’s face, I go through a crisis, myself! Why so dark, gentlemen? Make it funny! Stasis, a huge amount. Money’s frozen, no investments, and so on... What to do, I’m out of breath! A step ahead, And then two backwards... We’re dancing on a volcano, Dancing on a volcano. Mr Director! - That women is here. - Marta?! I have no idea how it happened. Did you tell her I was in, Ms Wanda? I told her I’d check, because I was out. What should I do now? There’s no back exit here! The closet, director! I don’t feel like playing hide and seek. There’s a passage there! The previous owner used it all the time when the repo man came by. As you can see, the director is out. He must have left while I was gone. Could I speak to director Adam Dereń? Marta Rozbicka speaking. Alright then. Right. Right. - So, we’ve conferred. - Yes. It’s not an easy choice to make, selling the land we’ve invested... so much money in. A huge investment. But since your daddy is set on adding this land to his farm, then... And to work the ground, then... we cannot stand in the way of such wonderful cause. By that you mean, you’ve decided to sell, gentlemen? But it costs 200 zlotys more on the morgen than the price your father quoted. - This is a serious transaction. - We simply can’t afford to lose on this. So it would be 14 thousand for 22 morgens. - 14 thousand. - 14 thousand. Alright. - Alright? - Alright? Father won’t be pleased to hear this, but I’m sure I can explain it to him. So there’s nothing in the way anymore to finalize the transaction. It’s getting dark, and you’re probably in a hurry to catch your train. You know what? Selling that rocky outcrop to that little Rozbicka lady was the single good deal we made. We got rid of at least one issue. But this is a disaster. This guy is going to send us packing! I transferred all my assets to my wife and kid, just in case. What do you think I did? I did the exact same thing. Good riddance. - Flashy ad, huge flop. - That’s right. See, he even rented those peoples with our money. - It’s “people”, plural! - Whatever. It’s your turn, Lena. Tell me, baby, if I was About to go crazy with you - Could it happen? - We could talk... - By “crazy” you mean... - Oh, I know... - The only issue here is this... - Issues already? You have to be good at it... You have to know how, You have to know your way around, - Have it here, and in here. - I got it all, whisk me away! One spoon of love for a glass of passion, a droplet of care, we’re ready to go. Let me drink it in one sip, Make it like a real alchemist, You have to be good at it, You have to know your way around, Have it here, and in here. I got it all, whisk me away! You have to be good at it, You have to know your way around, - Just know how... - ...to communicate, that’s it. Frederic told me you’ve refused to take part in the show. Isn’t this the greatest chance? You’d get to perform with stars. Not everyone gets a shot like this. I just don’t understand it at all, Liza! I bought this theatre for you, after all! Liar! I remember this man, Faust... Can I at least know why you changed your mind? No. I thought you’d be happy. Glad. You mean, “grateful”. - Even that. - Oh, what a disappointment for you. - So you won’t perform? - No. How does a man get old? Well? You have to be good at it, Old-age needs to have its moments! You have to be good at it, Just stay young while you get old! - One spoon of love for a glass... - ... of passion, lots of care, - drink it all while it’s still hot! - Let me have but a sip! - Don’t you tempt me! - Silly Faust. You have to be good at it, Old-age needs to have its moments! You have to be good at it, Just stay young while you get old! You have to be good at it, You have to know your way around, - Just know how... - ...to communicate. - That’s it! - That’s it! I was afraid there was something wrong between us. The constant stress, and the silly fights... I asked Frederic to convince you to perform. Look... What are you even doing all day, every day? This was wonderful for a while. Light a cigarette for me. And please, never ask me pointless questions again. No, you know me too well, sir, to not be aware that I do not tolerate any delay. Write down 3 days of pay as punishment. But you should be the one to tell Hanka that... I’ll tell her. Change the scenery, it’s time for Madam Aniela’s monologue. Get going! Why are you late, Hanka? I’m only half an hour late, it’s not a big deal, Frederic. - I’ll be ready in a flash. - I don’t know if you remember, the opening night is in a week and you haven’t gotten anywhere with your numbers! - Oh, really? - Yes, really! And keep it down. Calm down, Frederic. I’m about to prove you wrong! Mrs Helenka! Why is Frederic in such a bad mood today? “Haven’t gotten anywhere”, sure. What happened, Ms Hanka? - Hanka! Hanka! - Frederic! Hand me my bag. - My feather boa. - Hania. I’m never coming back here. Please, stay, Ms Hanka, calm down, - you’re such a wonderful performer... - Let it go. I’m never coming back here. Mr Porębski, please drive Hanka home. - What will they do without you? - Go bankrupt, of course. It’s over. She’s never coming back. All this because of some silly prank? This is absurd. You don’t know actors. I told you this before. She believes it with all her heart that if there’s a peacock in here somewhere, she’s bound to fail. The opening night in a few days, and I don’t have a star. There’s always Ms Lena. She’s too recognisable. Without Hanka the entire show’s layout is ruined. Hanka is, after all... a star. She’s like a magnet. It’s not just about people wanting to hear her sing, but to see her hair, her outfits, her make-up, comprenez-vous? Yes. Oui, mounsieur. Frederic. I’ve changed my mind. Would you give me a moment of your time? Turn on the lights. Ms Ewelina, one more. You must have gotten some really good news today. That’s right. To bankruptcy! Need a drink? No. I do. Do you remember our first night in Warsaw? Dear Lord, it seems like ages ago. You have no idea how glad I am to finally finish this. It’s a good thing that madwoman left the show. And you took her spot. When I heard you were going to sing I almost flew away from happiness. It’s basically guaranteed bankruptcy. Don’t take it personally, though. You said it yourself, you’re unlucky and talentless. We’ll start a new life in America. Let go of me. I really love you, Liza. Let go of me, you hear me?! Let me go! Wrap it up for me, please. I’m not sure if you’re aware of this garment’s price. This one, as well. That’s a fur from Mr Apfelbaum’s store... And send them to Bristol Hotel. How much do I owe you? POLISH AUDIO MAGAZINE WEEKLY A beauty pageant for cars was held in Paderewski’s park in Warsaw, organised by the Automobil Polish Club. One of the attendees was a local favourite, Mr Adolf Dymsza with his family. Ladies and gentlemen, unlike the stars in the sky, far out of your reach, this one you’ll soon be able to see and hear at the “Mirage” theatre, performing in a show expected to become the sensation Warsaw deserves. The 1920s, the 1930s, they will come back With a flutter of memories, A pale-blue shadow above your cards, Unbelievable! You remember this thin little thing from the hotel? What hotel? How do you know this woman? It’s a professional relationship. Professional? You expect me to believe this has something to do with oil? - How should I explain this? - Can you stop talking? Quiet down back there. We’re leaving, too. Now I know why you keep sighing in your sleep! Shut up! - I knew something was off! - Off?! Now I know why you brought me here, to be able to gloat over that lover of yours! “Lover”?! She’s a very nice girl! Yeah, very nice, I’m sure. I saw the way you looked at her! What else am I supposed to do at the movies? Close my eyes? You’d like me to do it! For good! - Then you’d be a bachelor! - I’d be a widower, if anything! But you’d feel like a bachelor! Well, keep dreaming! You and your... Are you okay, darling? Do you need water? Water?! You serve your wife water... And the whore gets champagne! Look... They all came to see you. It still feels unreal to me. I keep thinking I’m about to wake up, like Cinderella dreaming about the ball. You didn’t lose your glass slipper, you’re wide awake and you know exactly what you want, and that’s important. Was Hanka like this, too? I can’t recall. What do you know of women? Nothing at all. All you see are just shadows, Shadows on a painting, Though it’s not even a portrait, Just a sketch. People wrote all kinds of silly things on us. But little do you know, A woman is a spy. That’s just unheard of, simply unheard of! Every woman has something of Mata Hari. That’s just unheard of, simply unheard of! Every woman has something of Mata Hari. She pretends to count to three, Says she can’t count higher, But she’ll go and break that code And find out the secrets. She’ll see right through your scheme, Predict your next move with ease, Every woman has something of Mata Hari. Every woman is a spy! What do you know of women? All the lies. That a woman doesn’t think, And owns a body with no soul. That the man has all the intellect. Every book will tell you that, But no one manager to find out That a woman is an undercover spy. That’s just unheard of, simply unheard of! I also seem to start resembling Mata Hari. That’s just unheard of, simply unheard of! I also seem to start resembling Mata Hari. While I hug my husband dear There’s just one think I can think: Who left a kiss on his collar, And the red hair I found today? I need to find out what he did, Every woman’s like Mata Hari, and every husband Is a victim of her crimes That’s just unheard of, simply unheard of! Every woman has something of Mata Hari. That’s just unheard of, simply unheard of! Every woman is a spy. - I have the same thing. - How do you do, boys? - Hi! - Unbelievable. What a visionaire! He laid us a golden egg. How could we have doubted him? What a rookie mistake, transferring our assets to our wives. And what are we left with? They took everything and left us. How could I have predicted that not only my wife, but my auntie, too, had a lover? - At her age! - The leaving is not even the worst part. A wife, like a promissory note, always comes back to bite. This theatre is all we have left. Don’t worry about it. The tickets are selling fantastically. Starting tomorrow we’re “professional theatre managers”. Intermission’s over. Ladies and gentlemen, when France was ruled by Louis... whichever one, they used to say his rule was absolutism, only made bearable by the music. I’d say in our times it’s the absolutism of music that makes the rule a bit more bearable. What times am I talking about? Why, the 1920’s, the 1930’s, of course. Why are you squirming in your seat? I’m talking to you, sir. The dollar is still worth 5 zlotys! And on the Paris black market the value of zloty is 3 times the official value. Really! In a few years, the streets of Warsaw Will be filled with different people. But I know for sure That our times will return To them in melody. The 1920s, the 1930s, they will come back With a flutter of memories, A pale-blue shadow above your cards, And a small joke that made you smile. The 1920s, the 1930s, they’ll make A grand excuse for some reminiscing. The smell of wilted lilacs blue, And poems hidden in every word. Eyes full of tears, lilacs in bloom, Bright shining lights, reflected in the streets. Then you will miss this, Our beautiful lives, Just as real as us today! The 1920s, the 1930s, they will come back With a flutter of memories, A pale-blue shadow above your cards, And a small joke that made you smile. The 1920s, the 1930s, they’ll make A grand excuse for some reminiscing. The smell of wilted lilacs blue, And poems hidden in every word. If you look at it from distance That only time can grant you, This little moment in time Was ours, it was real, That’s why it will be remembered well... And then suddenly you’ll remember A scene, a word, a rhyme, And suddenly that person you forgot Will demand a spot in your heart. The 1920s, the 1930s, they’ll make A grand excuse for some reminiscing. The smell of wilted lilacs blue, And poems hidden in every word. Stairs, stairs, stairs, stairs, Like you’d see in Hollywood, Stairs are never Going out of style, Stairs are here to stay! Doesn’t matter where you’re from, Even a hermit in the wild Seeing stairs full of girls, Would exclaim and ask for more! Ask for more, ask for more ask for more! Success... You’re not the unlucky one, Liza. It’s me. Never thought it would turn out like this. I couldn’t even run this place into the ground. Go, win. It’s me, standing here, On the most important of all days, It’s my time, See the shadow on the curtain, That’s me - I’m here. Step, just one step, head is empty, Eyes are foggy, because I, I now see the price one must pay To play this game... I want to win, I feel like winning. To Hell with all virtues, Let my Guardian Angel suffer! I want you all To see me clearly, Whisper to me dearly, That this love is your first! Having fun, every night, I’m done losing, Time and chances, I must get to the top, It’s what I dream of! I can deal easily With all that comes to me, Though it’s a dangerous game To play on your own, Success, I need to find it, I need to bind it, Find myself amongst the stars! Success, I need to find it, I’ll do anything it takes, That’s what I tell myself, But what am I doing here? I’m on the stage, Eyes empty and dark, My moves, my words, All filled with unease, Why are you not here? Success, career, all that, now? My heart is filled with regret, This show was supposed to be grand! I practiced every day, I worked hard, Studied and tried, All for nothing, nothing, nothing! The rewards all seem empty, It doesn’t feel right, That’s not it! You still smoke “Prime Egiptian”? I came to see your show. Did you know that I bought the land? I brought the American drills, the ones that destroyed us back then. Pyzdra’s in, what about you? There’s more oil than we can handle. And the bank account likes it. It seems to me like your job here is done. Our train leaves in an hour. Our train? So the two of us... Yes. Our train. You’re gone, well, good, I’ll still be here, having a career, You should see me perform one day. So I just want to win, I feel like winning. To Hell with all virtues, Let my Guardian Angel suffer! I want you all To see me clearly, Whisper to me dearly, That this love is your first! My world is filled with laughs, Champagne filling our nights, Surely, I’m in love, Though don’t know with whom, No matter! I want to play for you all, On stage and on screen, I’m sure it will happen, It’s simply meant to be! Frederic... Oh, Frederic! Now there’s an artist that can sing. My Liza! Wonderful, amazing! Very, very well done! Incredible! Lizawieta! Congratulations. How would you like to star in my newest feature film? I’m Misha Waszyński. Wonderful! In a few years, the streets of Warsaw Will be filled with different people. But I know for sure That our times will return To them in melody. The 1920s, the 1930s, they will come back With a flutter of memories, A pale-blue shadow above your cards, And a small joke that made you smile.
