What it was, just this little Mexican whore took a liking to Cowboy and wanted to come back over here with him, her and her kid. So she laid down in front of his car and wouldn't let him go. And so here come the Federales, and Cowboy and Lionel had to take off. They damn near got thrown in the damn callaboose. Ain't neither one of them been down there ever since, I don't think.

So I jerk the son of a bitch out and the goddamn form breaks. And here comes this goddamn foreman. There's nothing I can do about it. It's not my job. So he's been fuckin' with me all day long, so I climb down off the rig, and I go up to him, I say, "If you wanna have a go at it, you can go ahead, but before you get up there, get your ass over in that office and tell that fat-ass secretary you been fuckin' to draw my check, 'cause I'm gone."

Listen, I'm thinkin' that I wanna take Mary over to the Paradise Motel, 'cause, you know, my place has got too many roaches, and she's staying with her folks and all. You think that you might be able to lend me $50? -Yes, no problem. -'Cause I'll pay you back. You know, when I see you. As long as it's for a good cause. I guess ol' John Henry's a good enough cause as any. -What'd you say, 50? -Yeah. No, wait, look, just put it back in your pocket, because I don't want Mary to-- I mean, if she sees it, it blows the whole deal. You know what I mean?

Yeah, here you-- [bottle shatters] Uh... well, I... guess I-- I guess I'm gettin' kinda tired, Cowboy. Maybe I'd better just be... goin' home. [♪] [♪] [cowbell clanks] Cowboy! Cowboy! Claude. What the hell you doin' here? I burnt that son of a bitch down. You did what? That goddamn house. Burnt the son of a bitch down. [chuckles] Come on, let's get the fuck outta here. Hell, I don't think I can move, Claude. Here, let me give you a hand. You burned the son of a bitch down. -[phone ringing] -[chuckling] Marcie's gonna have your ass! [ringing continues] [Claude] Yeah, shit. Well, I don't know how good of a job I did. [ringing continues] If that ain't Marcie, might ain't right. [ringing continues] Alamo. What? Marcie? Goddamn fire department got there too quick. Didn't hardly do diddly-shit. That figures. Boy, I better get my ass home. I ain't never gonna hear the end of this. Come on. [crickets chirping] Well, you can always blame me. Good idea. Might even work. That must've been a piss-poor fire you set. Hey, Cowboy, what's the matter? No balls? Fuck you, Steve. [♪] [truck starts] [♪] How you boys doin' tonight, huh? Y'all seen Cowboy around at all? We gotta go over to the fucking Paradise Motel and kick some faggot's ass. Man, goddamn fuckin' manager fuckin' kicked me and Mary out of the Paradise Motel! Well, no wonder. Oh, just shut up, Mary, and let me do the talking. [Mary] Okay, you just tell 'em what you did. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna tell the story, Mary. Okay? I'm gonna tell the story. I got kicked out of the hotel because I was wearin' my underwear and I was lookin' for the goddamn ice machine. -Oh, William! -That's all I was doin'! You were so drunk you don't even know what you were doin'. -Darlin', you know that-- -He was knockin' on people's doors. I was damn well not that fuckin' drunk. Yes, he was. He opened one door and this man looked at him, he's got these little moooses all over his underwear. Don't go talkin' 'bout my-- How would you like if I didn't wear no underwear? I'll walk around butt naked! Is that what you want? At least I don't wear none of that crotchless pussy shit! -You know? -Well, so what? Those little black panties, you know, with the little bit of the kitty cats on 'em? I'm goin' home. Can one of y'all take me home? Oh, now darlin', I'm gonna take you home! No, you-- I'm goin' home by myself. All right, fine! You go home! I will never talk to you again! All right, you just go home! Mary, you open this goddamn truck! Hey, Mary! Mary! Hey, you! [men hollering] -Run, Ichabod! -Whoo! [crickets chirping] [♪] [♪]
