- ♪ - CORNELIA: This is The Oaks. A house in the country which I rented for the summer. As an author, I write tales of mystery and murder. But the things that happened in this house were far more fantastic than any story I've ever had published. I brought a staff of servants from my city apartment and my maid, Lizzie Allen, who'd been with me nearly 20 years. Lizzie? - Yes, Miss Cornelia. - Is the car ready? - It's at the door. Look. - Mm? - Ms. Cornelia, them servants you brought from the apartment are talking about walking out on us. - Really? Well, I know they don't like it here, but I didn't think it was that bad. - Well, they've been hearing things about the killer that the police call The Bat and the murders that he committed here this past winter. Now people are saying that he's back again. - Well, how can they be sure of that? Has he committed another crime? - No, not yet. But that ain't saying that he won't. Here's something else. - You've heard about the bats they have here? Animals bats, the kind that fly? - Yes, yes. - Look what it says in this magazine. This is a report from the State Health Department, and it says some of them bats is rabid. - Well. - And that ain't all. Now there's a rumor going around that it was The Bat himself-- the killer, I mean-- that released the rabid bats in this neighborhood. - Ooh, that's ridiculous. - Well, the housekeeper, the cook, the butler and the upstairs maid don't think so. - Well, I can't help what they think. If hysterical nonsense like that can scare them out of their good jobs, it's their loss, not mine. Come on, Lizzie, I've got to get to the bank. - ♪ - Drive directly to Zenith Bank, Warner. I'm afraid we'll have to hurry. It's near closing time. - I'll get you there, Ms. van Gorder. - [engine starts] - Thanks again. - [phone ringing] - Ms. van Gorder. - How do you do, Mr. Bailey. - How are you? - I'm very well, thank you. You remember Lizzie Allen? - Of course. Hello, Miss Allen. - How do you do? - So you're spending the summer with us again? - Yes, yes, I've leased The Oaks, the home of your bank president, John Fleming. - I heard you had. I was surprised. - Why? Is there something the matter with it? - No, I was surprised, because Mr. Fleming said he would never rent it. - Ooh? Well, I rented it from his nephew Mark Fleming, who has the real estate office here. He said his uncle would be gone the entire summer. - Well, that's right. Mr. Fleming's in the north woods now with his physician Dr. Wells. Oh, pardon me. Dale? I want you to meet my wife. We were married at Christmas time. - That must have been nice. - Believe me, it was. Oh, here she is. - Hi, dear. - My wife, Ms. van Gorder, Ms. Allen. - How do you do, Mrs. Bailey? - How do you do? Cornelia van Gorder. - Yes. - Oh, well, I've read every murder mystery you've ever written. I just adored that weird one, "The Private Morgue of Doctor X," even though it gave me the shivers. - Only the shivers? Scared hell out of me. - Oh. - [laughs] - Well, I--I--I--I really mean that Ms. Corne killed 'em off in that one. - When you refer to my books, please don't call me Ms. Corne. - Pardon me, Mr. Bailey, Mr. Heinz is here to see you. - Oh, yes. [clears throat] Excuse me, please. Don't be strangers now. - Oh, no, we won't. - I should say not. - Oh, so you're a bride. - Well, not quite. - Not since Christmas. - Now I'm sure I've seen you. - Well, I--I used to be my husband's secretary here in the bank. - CORNELIA: Of course I remember. - May I welcome our most distinguished visitor back to Zenith? - Oh, that's very charming, but-- - Lieutenant Anderson. - --Lieutenant Anderson, of course. Chief of Detectives of the Zenith Police Department. This is Ms. Allen. - ANDERSON: Ms. Allen. - How do you do? - Lieutenant Anderson is one of our favorite citizens. He's on the bank's board of directors. - [chuckles] Not bad for a policeman. - You must have made a good thing of it. - [laughs] Well, I saved my money, if that's what you mean. - It's near closing time, and I've got some business in the safe deposit vault. Uh, please come and see me, Mrs. Bailey. - Oh, I'd love to. - And you, Lieutenant. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Nice to have met you. My, what a charming woman. She moved into The Oaks just the other day. - That house is a proper setting for a writer of mysteries. - Oh, it certainly is. - [chuckles] - Vic, what's the matter? - Come in here, both of you. - [phone ringing] - Andy, we're in trouble. Wendell Heinz came in to pick up $350,000 worth of bonds that we were holding as collateral for a loan. They were kept in our special vault. Mr. Fleming and I are the only officers of the bank who have access to that vault. - So? - The Heinz bonds are gone. That's not all. Other negotiable securities are missing. From what I can gather, short of a careful check, the bank has been looted of over $1 million worth of securities. - You'll have to notify Fleming. - I wish I could talk to him. Unfortunately, he and Dr. Wells are deep in the woods. They can't be reached by phone. - ♪ - What is it? - [crickets chirping] - I thought I heard someone on the path coming from the lake. Had an idea it might be that guide of ours. - Oh, Sam won't show up until morning. It's a 20-mile canoe trip from here to civilization. - Five will get you ten Sam has a message for me. - I thought you told them at the bank not to bother you. - I did, but they'll bother me. Doctor? - DOCTOR: Yes, John. - What would you do for half a million? - Anything short of murder. - Why not murder? - Too messy. - JOHN: Too great a risk? - For half a million, yes. - I pinched a million from the bank. Well, I'm not kidding. I embezzled it. - Not that I think you wouldn't do it if you thought you could get away with it. - I got away with it. I'm not talking about currency. I took negotiable securities that could be converted into cash. I have the cash in 10s, 20s and 100s. - Well, I'm your doctor, not your lawyer. Why tell me this? - You'll find out why. - Who's gonna take the blame for the robbery? - There's no cash here, they'll never suspect me. - I like Bailey. - Well so do I. I love the guy. I gave him his first chance. - He has a lovely little wife. - Charming girl. I was the best man. - Where's the million? - In my family's tomb in Zenith in the crypt with my father's casket. - I don't buy that, John. - No? - No. You forget that I had you in charge when you were a very sick man, when you raved in delirium. And I heard you talk about a hidden room. Now where else could you put a hidden room except in that mansion you built? That white elephant you call The Oaks. - Look, everyone knows I have a bad heart. Now who would doubt it if you wired the bank directors that my heart had failed? That I had fallen from a great height here in the woods? That I was badly smashed up? You could ship the body back for burial and, uh, instruct them not to open the casket due to the condition of its contents. - Well, you realize, of course, that we'd have to have a body to put in that casket, which means that we'd have to deal with an undertaker at this end. - Of course. - Well, where do we get a body? - Couldn't we provide one of our own? How 'bout Sam? - Sam, our guide? - Sam weighs about as much as I do. He's practically a hermit. He wouldn't be missed for a long time. - A local undertaker would know him. - JOHN: Not if we made him look as if he'd been in a serious accident. - But if Bailey's gonna take the blame, why do you have to do this? - A jury might acquit him. In that case, I'd be a logical suspect. I could disappear, of course, but it's safer if they think I'm dead. - What if I don't go for this deal? - In that case, it would be too bad. - You mean you'd kill me? - What else could I do now that I've told you about the million? I'd say you were shot in a hunting accident. Oh, look, doctor, if you can find another body instead of Sam's, it's all right with me. There's half a million in it for you. - I'll do my best. - [sniffs] I smell smoke. - So do I. What's that noise? - JOHN: Look, doctor, the woods are on fire. It's coming this way. We've gotta get out of here, out the back way. - DOCTOR: We will. - [gun cocks] - As soon as I provide that body we were talking about. - [gunshot] - ♪ - [thunder rumbles] - [crash] - Oh my goodness dear. Lizzie, is that you? - Yes, Ms. Cornelia. There's a storm coming up, and it's gonna be a snorter. The wind nearly blew the door off its hinges. - Well that noise blew my game higher than a kite. I think I've lost some of the cards. - Oh, I'll get them for ya. - Oh, I see you found the paper. - Drat that paperboy scooting by on his bicycle, just chucked it into a clump of bushes and let it go at that. For land sake. Mr. Vic Bailey's been arrested. - Oh? - LIZZIE: Right there. - "Victor Baily, Vice President and Cashier of the Zenith Bank "was arranged "before United States Commissioner Alvin Fielding, charged with the embezzlement of over $1 million." Oh, I can't believe Vic Bailey had anything to do with that robbery. Oh, well, I see our landlord is home again. - Landlord? - CORNELIA: Mr. Fleming. "Dr. Malcolm Wells is back in town "with the body of John Fleming, "President of the Zenith Bank, who was killed in a forest fire. Mr. Fleming will be laid to rest in his family's tomb on Friday." - And I hope he stays there. - Well, why shouldn't he? - Well, this is his house. And ever since he died, some funny things have happened here. - For instance? - The housekeeper, the cook, and the butler said that they heard strange noises at night. And the upstairs maid swore that she met a man without a face coming up the back stairs. - Ooh, so that's why they quit and left me to run this place without a staff. - They didn't tell you, Ms. Corne, but the truth is they were scared to stay. - But you're still here, Lizzie. Haven't you seen anything? - No. No, and even if I had, I ain't afraid of ghosts. They're afraid of me. Honest, Ms. Corne, a spiritualist told me once that ghosts was allergic to me. - [giggles] - But--but this bat fella they keep talking about in the paper, I--I guess he'd be different. - Oh, I don't think you would have the same effect on him. - [thunder rumbles] - Oh dear. - What are they trying to do? Drive people away from this part of the country? - Why? What does it say about The Bat? - His specialty seems to be killing women. My goodness, two of 'em in one night. All his victims died the same way. Like their throats had been ripped open with steel claws. - Well, that's a charming little caper. I'll have to try it sometime...in a book. - [banging] - [thunder rumbles] - That ain't nothing. Just something bumping against the house. - [door banging] - That's just the wind banging a door. Pay no attention to it. Listen to this. "One of his victims who lived for a moment after she was found described The Bat as a man without a face." Honest, Ms. Corne, I think that woman must have been exaggerating. - Uh. - [metal rumbling] - That's just that heavy tapestry at the top of the stairs. - I know, I know, I've heard it before on a windy night. - [fabric shuffling] - That sounds as if there were someone on the stairs. I know there isn't. At least there shouldn't be. - There ain't. Them's just the noises you hear in any old house on a windy night. It says here that The Bat never leaves no fingerprints. - That's understandable. Having no face, he probably has no fingers either. - [crash] - Lizzie! - [crash] - And that, I suppose, is the cat dropping its dentures. - No. No, I don't think so. But I think it's something should be looked into. Now who chucked him down here? - The wind, I hope. There must be a window open up there. No, Lizzie, let him lay, Lizzie. Let him sleep it off. My, I hope the power lines don't go down, put the lights out. We'll check the windows in the living room and draw the curtains, and then we'll go to bed. - Yes, ma'am. - LIZZIE: I won't be a minute. - [wind gushing] - Ah! Ms. Corne! - What? What? - Oh! I went to get the paper. I turned the latch off. I forgot to turn it on again. He's out there. He was coming in. He might have got you. - Oh, but he didn't. And he's still out there, thanks to you. Now you hurry now, and we'll call the police. - No, no. I won't leave you, Ms. Corne. - Are you okay? - Yes, ma'am. I'm--I'm okay. - Okay. - WOMAN: Operator. - Give me the police department, please. - MAN ON PHONE: Zenith Police Department. - This is Cornelia van Gorder. I'm living at The Oaks. - MAN: We know about that, Ms. van Gorder. - Just a moment again, a man tried to force his way into this house. - MAN: You're not alone there, are you? What about your servants? - Well, I have none except my chauffeur. And he's away, he won't be back until the morning. Now there's only two of us here tonight, and we're gonna lock ourselves in my room. Now, uh, if--if any of your men see anything, will you have them call me? - MAN: I'll send officers over there right away. - Well, thank you very much. Come on, Lizzie, we're gonna sleep in my room. - [thunder rumbles] - Well, nothing can get at us in this room now. I think this door seems good and solid. - Mm, like the door to a tomb. - Uh, I think that couch will be comfortable. There's some extra bedding, you know-- - Yes, ma'am. - --in the closet. Let's see now. - [thunder rumbles] - Uh-ha. No bolt. Well, that's not so good. - Well, what's that for? - That, my good woman, is a booby-trap. If anybody tries to open this transom, this will be knocked off and we'll hear it fall. - Oh fiddlesticks. I forgot my night things--my robe, my gown and my slippers. I'll go get 'em now. - Now wait a minute, Lizzie. I'll go with you. - Now don't you bother, Ms. Cornelia, my room's just down the hall. - CORNELIA: Lizzie, I told you to wait. - It's all right. I'll only be a second. - BOTH: [screaming] - Get in here. Get in here. - [phone ringing] - Yes? - MAN: Ms. van Gorder? - Yes. - MAN: Zenith Police Department. There's a police car just outside your house, and the officers in it have reported that there's no sign of a prowler anywhere on the grounds. - Well, the man's inside now. He's in the hall just outside my bedroom. Have your men break through the kitchen door and search this place from top to bottom. - MAN: Okay, Ms. van Gorder, sit tight. - I will. I have a gun, and I know how to use it. - ♪ - Oh, relax. Relax, Lizzie, the police did a good job. They couldn't find anybody in here. - LIZZIE: But we both saw him, Ms. Cornelia. - All right, all right, so he got away. But there are men on guard outside, so just try and get some rest. There's nothing can get at us here. - [sighs] [sighs] - ♪ - [screams] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. - What? - Ms. Cornelia, Ms. Cornelia. - What's the matter? - A bat. - Oh, nonsense, you've had a nightmare. - Maybe I did, but there was a bat and it bit me. - What? - It flew in that closet. - Oh, good gracious, Lizzie, you're right. Oh. - [Lizzie moaning] - Operator, Operator, will you get me Dr. Malcolm Wells' office, please? No, I don't know his number, and I have no phonebook up here, but this is an emergency. Will you connect me with his office, please? - Oh dear, oh dear, I'm gonna get the rabies. - WOMAN ON PHONE: Hello? - Hello. Dr. Wells' office? - WOMAN: This is a call service. Dr. Wells is out at the moment. But if you'll give me your name and number, I'll try to locate him. - Well, this is Ms. van Gorder of The Oaks. My maid has just been bitten by a bat that may be rabid, and she must have treatment as soon as possible. And I was told that Dr. Wells was the nearest physician. - WOMAN: I'll try to find him for you. And if I can't, I'll send you another doctor. - Oh, well, thank you very much. Oh, he's out on a case. - Oow. - I hope it's not a delivery. A baby, I mean. They can be terribly complicated. - They never bothered me none. - Oh, Lizzie, you never had a baby. - Of course, I didn't.

How is your maid? Is she in any pain? - No. No, she doesn't seem to be. - Did the bat get away? - No, I believe it's still in my bedroom. - Oh good, I'll want to examine it. There you go, Ms. Allen. Now you'll feel better. - Doctor, have I got the rabies? - Well, I can tell you better after I've examined the bat's brain under a microscope. - That thing's got a brain? - Oh, you'd be surprised. Where it is? - I think the little darling is in that closet. - Oh. You know it's a pity you leased this house, Ms. van Gorder. - Why a pity? - Well, my dear lady, I don't wanna alarm you, but-- - Oh, well after tonight, nothing can alarm me. - Yes, I understand. It must have been terrifying. So many unexplainable things have happened here. There's something about the place. Your servants must have sensed it when they walked out on you. An apprehension of disaster. Well, let's see. Uh-ah, yes. There he is. All right now, take it easy. Nobody's gonna hurt you. Quiet now. Quiet. - [bat squeaking] - He looks quite normal, doesn't seem to be sick at all. - Oh, ain't that nice. I've been worried about him. - Well, you should be. From his appearance, I'd say that he doesn't have any infection. In which case, you've had a narrow escape. Now you take one of those tablets I've left for you, and I'll guarantee you a good night. And I'll drop in on you tomorrow. - Oh, thanks for everything, doctor. - Oh, don't worry, I can find my way out. - Oh, I know you can, but do let me help you. - Oh, don't forget that once I'm gone, you'll have to climb those stairs alone. - Oh, I'm all right. I'm armed now. - Can you shoot one of those things without shutting your eyes? - Oh, doctor, there are guns in ever book I've ever written. I don't write about things I'm unfamiliar with. - [laughs] - Lock the door, Lizzie. - Good night. - Yes, ma'am. Good night, doctor. - Accident? - No, no, the wind blew him down. - Oh. - I think. - Oh. Did you know that young Mark Fleming leased you this house without notifying his uncle? - No. No, I didn't. - Well, it doesn't matter now. John Fleming is dead, and Mark's his heir. But if John were alive, he would warn you to leave here, Ms. van Gorder. - Really? - Yes. It's been a tragic place for anyone who ever lived in it. Well, good night. - Good night, doctor. - Who's out there? - MAN: Nobody you need to worry about, doctor. - Oh, it's Andy. - That's right. Good evening, Ms. van Gorder. - Good evening, Lieutenant. - Somebody sick here? - My maid was bitten by a bat. - Oh? A rabid bat? - Well, I'll know for sure when I get to my lab. I--I caught the bat. - It happened indoors? - In my bedroom, yes. - How'd it get in? - Well, there's many ways a bat could get in a house. - You outta know. I--I spotted this hole in the window the minute I got here. That's where the two-legged bat got your door open. - Ms. van Gorder told me that she, uh, phoned headquarters at Zenith. - Yes, I phoned twice. The second time was after the prowler got in the house. - Weren't at headquarters, Andy? - No, but they contacted me. - An officer came and searched the house from top to bottom, but they couldn't find The Bat. - You--you better have this window fixed tomorrow. - Oh, yes, I certainly shall. - I'd better be going. I'm due in surgery at 8 o'clock in the morning. Good night. - Good night, doctor. - There will be a man patrolling the grounds all night, Ms. van Gorder. - Oh, thank you. - And nobody inside, Andy? - Why should there be? - Well, how do you know but what The Bat is hiding somewhere in the house? - I'm quite sure he isn't in the house, doctor. Not now. Good night. - CORNELIA: Good night. - Hi, Andy. - Hello, Mark. Well, congratulations. - [laughs] - Real estate business must be picking up. New office, new furniture. - New deal. How do you like it? - Uh, looks expensive. Are you squandering your inheritance? - [laughs] I haven't got it yet. - The paper says John Fleming left his entire fortune to you. - Funny thing about that entire fortune is that we can't find it. - No kidding. - No, all Uncle John had in his bank account was a couple of hundred dollars. And his safe deposit box was empty. - If we don't find that missing million, mine will be empty, too. - How come? - Well, all my savings were invested in Zenith Bank stock. The examiners won't certify the bank is solvent until those stolen securities are found, so the stockholders have voted an assessment that'll wipe some of us out. But since those securities have been converted into cash, and if I can't find that cash, I'm sunk. - Oh, where are you gonna look for it, Andy? - Here in Zenith. Your uncle wouldn't take a million on a hunting trip, would he? - [laughs] You suspect Uncle John? Why, Andy, he founded the Zenith Bank. That'd be like robbing the family tomb. - You think he wouldn't? - Well...besides, Vic Bailey's fingerprints are all over the vault. Now they didn't find any of Uncle John's fingerprints. - 'Cause he wipes them off. - Can the defense prove that? - They're trying to. - Judy Hollander, Bailey's secretary, is a defense witness. And they believe her testimony'll have a powerful effect on the jury. - Oh, well, she has a powerful effect on me. Judy's a doll. - Here's the book you mentioned, Judy. - Your newest one? - Yes, it's just been published. You can have that copy if you wish. - Oh, it's a first edition and you've signed it. - CORNELIA: Yes, of course. - Thank you so much. - Uh, may I serve tea now, Ms. van Gorder? - Yes, please do, Warner. - Thank you. - Uh, I see you've engaged new servants. - Yes, of course. - Well, how did you persuade them to live in this house? - Well, Jane Patterson, my new housekeeper knows this house better than you do, doctor. - Oh? - She worked for John Fleming. And Warner was my chauffeur. - Chauffeur turned butler? - It's incredible. He can play any part at a moment's notice. Uh, did you--did you get a plumber, Warner? - WARNER: No, we can't get a plumber for three days, madam. - What about that leaking pipe? The basement will be flooded in three days. - Well, the pipe is no longer leaking. - You mean it's dried up of its own accord? - No, not quite. I packed the elbow where the water was coming out. - CORNELIA: Packed the elbow? Where did you learn how to do that? - Uh, into each life, a little rain must fall. And a careful man learns to keep himself dry. Now is there anything else that you require, Ms. van Gorder? - No, not at the moment, Warner. - Thank you, madam. - Now there's a character. - How long did you say that he worked for you as chauffeur? - About three months. - Well, I hope he doesn't have a police record. My dear Dale, it may interest you to know that the last night of his life, John Fleming told me that he loved your husband like a son. If Fleming were alive today, he would be fighting to prove Vic's innocence. - Could Mr. Fleming prove his own innocence? - Ms. van Gorder, can there be any doubt about it? - There will be when Ms. Hollander testifies at Vic's trial. - Oh? You know something that we haven't heard yet, Judy? - Something I saw with my own eyes. - She's not permitted to say what it was. - My dear girl, I wouldn't think of asking her. But let's assume for a moment that Fleming did steal the million. Now what would he do about it? Where is it? - Hidden someplace where he could lay his hands on it without getting caught in the act. Now if I was writing this instead of living in the middle of it, I'd hide it right here in this spooky old house. - Under a loose floorboard or up a chimney? [laughs] - [laughs] - If Mr. Fleming had the nerve to steal a million, he'd make his plans well in advance. I'd say he'd prepare a place to hide it. Possibly when this house was being built. Now I rented this place from Mark Fleming, his nephew. I wonder--I wonder if he'd have the floor plans. - I'll ask him. - Yes. Lizzie? Will you bring Mrs. Bailey the phone? You ask him now. His number is Summit--Summit 7537? - Thank you, Lizzie. Summit? - CORNELIA: 7537. - Not bad, eh, Andy? That means new business. - [phone ringing] - Now you see, somebody wants to buy a house. Mark Fleming speaking. Oh, hello, Dale. Well, hang on a minute, honey, while I see if I have 'em. It's Dale Bailey all excited. Ms. van Gorder wants to know if I have the floor plans of The Oaks. Now what would she want with the floor plans? - Well, she suggested to me that your uncle might have hidden the bank loot there. Are the plans here? - Well, somewhere in the house itself. Wait a minute, there is a place where Uncle Johnny might have kept those blueprints. - What place? - Well, I heard him talk about it a good many years ago. I can't be sure of the exact location. Anyway, I don't think the old boy had the guts to steal a million. But if I find those plans, I'll let you know, Andy. Hello, Dale. Look, honey, I haven't seen those plans since I was a kid. But I'll come over tonight and maybe we can find 'em. - Thank you, Mark. We'll expect you. He seems to think they're here in the house somewhere. He's coming over tonight. - Well, that's good. Dale and Judy are my houseguests for the weekend. Would you like to have dinner with us tonight? - Oh, no thank you, I couldn't. I still have a few calls to make. You know, if Judy's testimony is going to clear Vic Bailey and implicate John Fleming, others may get the idea that there's buried treasure in this house. Don't even mention your testimony until you're actually on the stand. - Oh, I won't. - That's a smart girl, Judy. And a very lovely girl. Well, good afternoon, ladies. - Goodbye. - Doctor. Come on, girls, let's go. - ♪ - CORNELIA: So many unusual things have happened here this summer. The more I think about it, the more I realize I should be putting them down on paper.

I cooked the dinner tonight. - Did you know that the secret closet was here? - No. It was behind the grandfather's clock. - Well, it was I who found it really. Noticed the clock had been moved and the door wasn't quite closed. - [doorbell rings] - I'll get it. - Who is it? Mark Fleming. - Mm, as coroner, you saw the same wounds on the others. How long he's been dead? - Oh, I'd say about a half an hour. You believe it was The Bat? - That's The Bat's trademark. - Perhaps he's still in the house. - That's possible. - Why should he be? - Because he's looking for something. And like you, he believes it's here. And he's a persistent killer. I would advise you to get out of this house as quickly as possible. Notwithstanding our expert police protection. Have you called the morgue? - They're on their way here. - Oh good, I want to examine the body before they get here. Um, maybe take it into another room. - Yes, to the sunroom in the back. - [doorbell rings] - Thank you, give me a hand. - Excuse me. - Oh, Warner, where've you been? - Well, madam, it--there's been an accident? - There's been a murder. Mark Fleming, the young man from who I leased this place, was killed here tonight. - Do they know who did it? - Well, they--they believe it was The Bat. - I'm sorry I had to use the front door, Ms. van Gorder. But I forgot my keys. When I rang the bell at the kitchen door, there was no response. - Oh, this is Warner, Lieutenant. He's my butler. He was my chauffeur. - Why did you promote him? - Well, it's very difficult to find a butler. They don't like service in the country. - Have you ever been a butler before? - I've served in many capacities, sir, but this was my night off, and I forgot my keys. - I heard that part. What time you'd leave the house tonight? - Oh, about 6:30. I had dinner at Wiley's Roadhouse. - Mm-hmm. Can you prove where you spent the rest of the evening? - I can try. - Try hard. And don't leave the house. I'll get to you later. - Very good, sir. I shall be in my room, Ms. van Gorder, if you need me. - Yes, Warner. Surely you don't think he's-- - Warner and I've met before. I can't recall where or when, but I will. There'll be a crew here shortly from headquarters dusting for fingerprints, taking photographs. But in the meantime-- Mrs. Patterson, you aren't leaving the house tonight, are you? - No, Lieutenant. - Don't, I'll talk to you in the morning. Good night. - Good night, sir. Good night, Ms. van Gorder. - Dale...I was with Mark Fleming this afternoon when you talked to him about the floor plans of this house. I heard him tell you he was coming here tonight. - Dale called him at my request. She told me he was coming. - LIETENANT: Who else heard you tell her that? - Judy, Lizzie. - And that nice Dr. Wells. - Dr. Wells? There are few killers who kill for the fun of it. The Bat, very likely, is a mental case, and I'm convinced that his crimes are motivated by his manual for personal gain. There's a million dollars at large. And he's gonna keep on hunting for it until he lays his hands on it. Now these young ladies are staying here tonight? - Yes, they're my houseguests. - Well, when my crew arrives, we'll be busy for a while. So I'd suggest-- - That we go to our rooms? That's a very good idea. Come on, girls. - What about a police guard for this house tonight, Lieutenant? - You've got one. I'm gonna cover this place tonight from the attic to the basement. If The Bat makes another call, I'll have a little surprise for him. - Who, uh--who is he? Have you any idea? - He could be anybody. So far, there are clues to his identity, but nothing we could take before a jury. - I am afraid we must look higher than the criminal world. He may be a merchant, lawyer, doctor, scientist, one of the pillars of his community. Ladies, lock your doors tonight, stay behind them. I promise you you'll be safe. Good night. - Good night, Lieutenant. - Good night. - ♪ - Poor Mark. - Yeah, it's a pity. So young. Well, doctor, do you agree it was The Bat? - In my report, I shall say the death was caused by the same technique used in the other killings. A paralyzing blow to the throat followed by severe lacerations of the jugular, resulting in excess hemorrhage. - In a layman's language, he didn't know what hit him. - Oh, he knew. But he didn't have time to think about it. You staying here tonight, Andy? - Well, until I check the doors and windows. But I'll be back bright and early in the morning. - "Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night "stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds." - A lot of people are due for a shot when I close this case. - Yes, I'm sure they are. Good night, Andy, don't get hurt. - Good night, doctor. - [engine starts] - You know, I think we'd better let you get some sleep. - Oh, Lizzie and I share this room for mutual protection. You know, one night, a storm blew the wires down, put the lights out. And I went out the next day and bought a half a dozen of these things. You better take one with you, Dale. - Oh, thank you. - We'll go across the hall now. - Are you sure there's nothing else you need? - Oh, no. - Quite sure, we'll be all right. - Well, if anything bothers you, you just sing out, and two strong women will come to your rescue. - [laughing] - Oh, nothing will bother us. Not with Andy on the job. - No. - Good night. - Good night, girls. Don't worry, everything will be all right. - Good night. - Good night. Come on, Lizzie. - [sighs] Oh, I don't think I'll sleep tonight. - Me either. - All I can see is poor Mark Fleming staring at us. I thought that when people died their eyes closed as in sleep. - Don't think about it. - I'll bet you're thinking about it. - No, I was thinking of my poor husband sleeping in jail tonight. Oh, Judy, I love him so much. - [crickets chirping] - [menacing music plays] ♪ ♪ - [tapping] - [hammering] - [hammering continues] - What's that noise? - Oh, I don't know. I kinda fell half asleep. For a moment I thought it was something from a dream. - It's somewhere in the house. - Yes, on the floor above. Not directly over us. Probably a room overlooking the driveway. - [hammering] - [snoring] - Should we call, Ms. van Gorder? - She'll hear it. How can she help but hear it? Besides, we don't want her to think we're a couple of hysterical women. - Oh, I'm about to become one. - Oh, dear. - I've had it for one night. Dale, you're not going out in that hall. - I wanna know what's happening up there. - But Lieutenant Anderson said if we stayed behind our locked doors, we'd be safe. - Vic isn't safe locked up in that jail. - Oh, but-- - Suppose that stolen money is in this house. Mark Fleming seemed to think it was. Maybe that's what's somebody's looking for. - [hammering continues] - Oh, for heaven sake, don't you hear that awful noise up there? Now, Lizzie! Lizzie! You just gotta stay awake. The house phone and the outside phone wires have been cut, and we can't get help. - Where's that policeman? - Oh, I don't know. Something must have happened to him. Now go on, get on your robe. - Oh, Dale, please don't go up there. - I've got to. Think would it could mean to Vic. Now you stay here. - Oh no. If you go, I go. - [hammering] - You stay here. - No, no, no. I won't let you go up there alone. - You wait here, I'm gonna see what it is. - Oh, please, let me go with you. - Judy, will you warn me if anyone comes? And I'll only be a moment. Now wait. - [hammering] - [door handle rattles] - [screams] - [screaming] - [indistinct yelling] - Oh, Judy. No, no, not Judy. - Dale. - Give her to me, I'll look after her. - [crying] - Dale. - [crying] - Poor baby. - [crying] - Judy. The Bat? - Yes, The Bat. He caught her at the head of the stairs. We saw him rushing down the stairs as we came out of the room. I hurled that after him. I hit him, I believe. "I'm gonna cover this place from attic to basement," you said. Well what were you covering when that poor child was murdered? Where were you? - I saw a man outside on the grounds. I went out there and hunted him. I heard him in among the trees, and so I followed the sound of him as far as the brook down near the back road. And then I lost him. - [gasps] - I'd rather give my own life than have this happen to Judy. But I told you to stay in your rooms and lock your doors and stay there! What was she doing at the head of those stairs? - That was my fault. - CORNELIA: They heard a strange noise, heavy pounding in one of the rooms on the third floor. We all heard it. - DALE: I wanted to see what it was. Judy--she wouldn't let me go out by myself. I made her stay on the balcony. - What about your new butler? - Well, he's in his room, I suppose. - Oh, Mrs. Patterson. - Oh, yes. - Did you know what happened here? - No, sir, but I heard the screams. I went to call Warner. We have rooms on the same floor, but he wasn't in his room. His bed hasn't been slept in. - If Mrs. Patterson could hear the screams, Warner could certainly hear them. - You're quite right, sir. I heard them. - Oh, you did? And where were you? - Outside in the grounds. - Ms. Hollander's been murdered. - No. - Oh, so you're surprised? Shocked? Well, I've seen better performances. I remember you now. Your name's not Warner. I've got a circular in my office with your picture on it. The Chicago police, not so long ago, were hunting for you in a connection with a robbery. - You're right again, sir. And they found me, and they've tried me. And I prove my innocence, and I was acquitted. - That could have been a lucky break. Where were you when this child was killed? - I told you before, sir, outside. - What were you doing there? - I was following you. I saw you leaving the house, and it seemed that you were hunting someone. I thought that you might need some help. - Ugh. - Oh, yes, sir. I followed your flashlight down through the trees. Then it disappeared. And then suddenly as I was staring out into the darkness, I was struck by something on the back of the head. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, and I realized I'd been knocked out. - I wish you had been knocked out. 'Cause then we would have found you with your mask still on your face. You were hit here in this house with this poker, as you were rushing down those stairs after that child was killed! - Oh no, sir, you can't pin this on me! I'm not The Bat! I've never killed! I couldn't kill! I won't take the rap for this! - [door opens] - Well, doctor... we have another case for the County Coroner. You see The Bat came back. Why did you come back, doctor? - Well, I--I had an accident, uh, about a mile down the road. The right rear wheel of my car came off, and I plunged into the ditch. This was the nearest house, so I came here to call for help. I thought I'd find you around, Andy. - Physician, heal thyself. You must have been hit by something on the back of your head. - I told you I had an accident. - So you did, doctor. So you did. I could be wrong, but maybe I'm not. We shall see. - All right, Dale, let's start a new chapter. For days, the murders held the headlines. Lieutenant Anderson grilled us and ransacked the house from top to bottom. Warner was not placed under arrest, but his every move was watched. At night, except for a detective on guard in the house, the police and the reporters left us alone. And on one of those nights, without telling Lizzie or anyone else, I pursued a secret investigation of my own. - ♪ - CORNELIA: It was in an empty room on the third floor where we kept our trunks and other things. - ♪ -Put 'em up, Bat. It's a bright idea to kill me in my own lab and let people think that I'm The Bat. But you had to kill me first. What was it to be? An ambush? Clever as you are, you're not smart enough to do that. Nobody's smart enough to find the money though. You came quite close to it. But I know where it is. And when you're dead with that sign pinned on your chest, I'm going to collect it and live happily ever after. "He destroyed himself." How true that will be. Goodbye, Bat. Here's a serum that will heal you whether you're rabid or not. - [crash] - [gunshot] - [gunshot] - ♪ - [banging on wall] - Something's wrong. Something's wrong. Ms. Cornelia? Ms. Cornelia? Now where would she be going at this time a night? Well, lamb's sake. Ugh. I never. Ugh. Mr. Davenport. Mr. Davenport. Oh, a fine thing. The door unbolted, the chain off, and you asleep on the job. Wait 'til Lieutenant Anderson hears about this. Come on, wake up. What's the matter with you? - I don't know. I don't know. My head hurts. My whole body's numb. - Here. Here, take a sip of this. Try to snap out of it. I'll be back in a minute. - [crickets chirping] - [door rattles] - [knocking at door] - Hurry, will you? It's Lizzie. I'm terribly worried. I can't find Ms. Cornelia anywhere, and something's happened to the policeman. I don't know what. Get Warner, bring him to the drawing room. Tell him we need him. - [heavy breathing] - LIZZIE: Are you all right now? - Yeah, I'll be all right in a minute. I remember now. I took a drink of wine from that decanter there. Ms. van Gorder told me to help myself. - She wouldn't put nothing in it. - Well, somebody did. Somebody who knew I was on duty here. - Then it was somebody that got Ms. van Gorder. I can't find her anywhere upstairs, downstairs or in the basement. I told the housekeeper to get Warner. - Lieutenant Anderson will wanna know about this. Hello. Yeah, this is Davenport at The Oaks. We've got trouble here. Well, for one thing, I was drugged. Yeah, but I must have been knocked out, because the maid tells me Ms. van Gorder's missing. Well, you better call Anderson, let him know. He's not a home? Well, where is he? Out on a case--what case? Dr. Wells? What else did they tell you about it? - Oh hurry, will you? We've got to find Ms. Cornelia. - [heavy breathing] - Okay. Lieutenant Anderson is out on a case. Dr. Wells was found dead in a room next to his garage murdered. - Dr. Wells? - There's something queer about the killing of Wells. But headquarters won't talk about it. - Lizzie, Warner isn't in his room. There's no sign of him anywhere. - And I was supposed to keep an eye on that guy. - Where's Ms. Cornelia? That's what I wanna know. - Wait a minute. Didn't you say that the chain and the bolt were off of the front door? - I certainly did. - Well, maybe Ms. van Gorder went outside. - She never would. We better look. - [crying] I can't--I can't breathe. There's no air-- - Ms. Cornelia? - Oh, Ms. van Gorder? - Ms. Cornelia? Ms. Cornelia? - Ms. van Gorder? - Look! There's a light in that room of the third floor. Were you up there tonight? - Well, of course I was, but I turned the lights out before I came downstairs. - Then Ms. Cornelia might have turned them on again. That's where we're gonna look first. Come on. - ♪ - [crying] - Ms. Cornelia? Ms. Cornelia? Ms. Cornelia? - Yes, Lizzie, I'm here. - [banging on wall] - CORNELIA: Come--come to the mantelpiece. - Here we are, Ms. van Gorder? What do we do now? - Over the mantle, there are five panels. Strike it with your hand. - Which panel did you say, Ms. van Gorder? - CORNELIA: Oh, I can't. I just can't. - DAVENPORT: Ms. van Gorder, which panel? We couldn't hear you. - She said strike it, which difference does it make which panel? Strike 'em all. Look. - Oh, oh. Oh, it's all right now. It's all right, dear. Lizzie's here. - Feeling better? - Yes, much better. - We'll take you to your room. - Oh no you won't. I'm gonna stay right here. I'm quite all right. Oh, how blessed it is to breathe without an effort, you know? No one knows how sweet the air can taste until someone shuts it off for a moment. That room is just like a box. When the mantelpiece closed, it seemed like all the air was drawn out of it. - Look, there it goes again! - DAVENPORT: Let it close. I can open it from in here. There's a control panel behind this blueprint. Electric border under the trap door here. Once the door's open, you can keep it that way. I believe that the fireplace in this other room opens the same way. And it does. - For pity's sake. I tried to find this, but I couldn't find it. - Yeah, it was back of this blueprint here. Well, it's quite a setup. Too bad we can't open that safe in the same way. Take an expert to crack this box or a shot of nitro. - Or maybe--maybe that's what The Bat had in mind. - Could be. Seems he's on the prowl tonight. - Ms. van Gorder, Warner has disappeared. - And Dr. Wells has been murdered. - Dr. Wells? - Lieutenant Anderson's on that case right now. - Well, does he know what happened here tonight? - They got word to him.

You watch the stair. Can't you see that fire was set to get us out of the house? - Out of the house--well, you're talking about the-- - Yes, yes, I'm talking about The Bat. Now that the lights are out, he'll think his trick has worked and we've gone. He'll be here any minute. - DAVENPORT: Well, so will Lieutenant Anderson. - I hope so. But The Bat will be here first.

I was headed for a plane. But halfway to the airport, I changed my mind and came back. I'm glad that I did. - Oh, why it's Lieutenant Anderson. Yes, it was Anderson. He discovered the secret of the hidden room and was waiting to get into it and open up the safe. We found the money in it. Little over a million in 10s and 20s and 100s. [laughing] Good old Andy. With all his ill-gotten gains invested in bank stock, it's a rather clever way to hide stolen money. In the open, as it were, and so respectable. But don't try it. No matter how clever you are, you can't hide murder. Well, that's it, Dale. That's the end. - ♪
