- Federal agents, freeze! Don't touch that gun, Don't touch it! What is this, what's going on? - Federal agents, freeze! Do you see me moving? - Cuff him. - Lorenzo, lorenzo! - Cuff him. - What's this? - Your new life. - Teresa matheson. - Sign here. - You really think you can protect me? - Haven't lost one yet. - Well... It's not much, elena, but it's home. - Hello? Hello? Teresa, is that you? - We got this, right? Hey, just you and me. - Mom, I'm home. Mom? Mom? Mom? - Elena, I didn't hear you come in. - Are we going somewhere? - Uh... Actually, I need to talk to you. Let's go sit, dinner should be ready soon. - You said you wanted to talk. - I have to go away for a few days. You'll be alright on your own, won't you? - Sure but what's going on? Where are you going? - I have to go home, Back where I grew up. Your grandmother in the hospital. - Wait, what? - She's very sick And may not have much longer. - You mean grandma sofia, did she die like a long time ago Before I was born? - That's what I told you. - So my grandmother's still alive. - I thought I was doing the right thing at the time. - What, why? - I'm sorry I lied, but I wanted to protect you. - To protect me from my own grandmother? - It's more complicated than that. - Complicated how? Okay, well, why can't you explain it to me? Just tell me the truth. - You have a right to know the truth, but not now, not yet. - Why? - I need to finish packing. - When do you leave? - Early tomorrow. I'll be gone and back before you know it. - Have a good trip, I guess. - Bye, baby. - Bye, mom. - Bye. I have to remind you, this trip goes against The advice of the federal marshall service. - I am well aware. - Do you know that we can't guarantee your protection once You leave here, you'll be giving up your cover. - I know the risks. They play in my head on a loop. You know, there's some things in life you just have to do. I owe this to my mother. - Your mother wouldn't want you To risk your life to see her. Teresa, don't do this. - If anything should happen to me... - Your daughter will be taken care of. Hi, you've reached teresa, please leave a message And I'll get right back to you. - Mom, it's me. I haven't heard from you And I'm starting to get really worried, Please call me back. Who are you? - Grant carter, us marshals service, can I come in? - I saw you before. What do you want with my mom? Is she in trouble? - I'm actually here to talk to you. It's about your mother but it would be better If I could come inside. You can keep The door open if you want. - Okay. I was about to make some coffee, do you want some? - Sure. Thanks. - So, you said you're a us marshal? - That's right. - So what is it? - It's about your mother. - Yeah, you already said that. Did something happen? - She was found last night. Authorities are saying it's a homicide. - What? - I'm sorry. - She's dead? - Someone found her at the hospital After she had visited your grandmother. She had asphyxiated. - How could someone do that to her? - Look, I know this is a shock, do you want to sit? I don't know how much she told you about her past And her involvement with the marshal's office. - Her what? I... I can't. I don't want to hear this right now. - This affects you too. - My mom is gone. I don't care about anything else. - For when you're ready to talk. - Please just go. Get out. How could you leave me like this, mom? I still need you. Russo? What is this? Four valley plain teens were involved in a two-car accident On Friday leaving one passenger dead and another paralyzed. Track star teresa russo was hospitalized with several broken Bones while her friend jacqueline armstrong was admitted With a concussion and severe facial lacerations. Teresa russo? Look, if you don't leave, I'm gonna call the cops. Elena? - Someone's outside of my door trying to break into my house. - Find a place to stay out of sight, I'll be there in less than ten. - Okay. - It's carter! - Did you see them? - I checked the whole neighbourhood. - Well, someone was here. - I believe you and I take all Potential threats seriously. We'll see what your neighbour's cameras can tell us. - It's weird, right? The timing. - Could be a regular robbery Attempt or it could have Something to do with your mom. - How? - I guess teresa didn't mention the witness protection program. - Mom was in the witness protection program? - She was. So were you, by default. Until now. - Until she died you mean. - Someone very dangerous has been after your mom For the past 21 years. Last week when she went to her hometown... - They found her and they killed her. - So... So, you know who did it, you can arrest them. - Possible leads, but we need something concrete to be able To bring our case to the us attorney. Elena, I'm concerned about your safety, especially after Everything that happened today. I think we should find A place for you to move to. - What? What? No. I... I just lost my mom, this place Is the only thing I have left. - Please consider this. When you're ready, We can set you up with a new identity. - Like you did for my mom? Didn't work out so well for her. - Alright, keep the door bolted shut, make sure the windows Are all locked, don't let anyone in. - You're leaving? - I have to. I'm sorry. - But I have more questions. - Do you know arbor park? Why don't you meet me there at noon tomorrow? I'll bring your mother's file and I'll post a car out front To watch the house tonight. - I'll be there. - Uh, you got ketchup on your tie. - Ah, shoot. Uh... Um... As promised, Copy of your mother's witness protection file. - There's not much here. - Yeah. Because her case is still open, Some of the files are classified. - What about my dad? Is he in here? Lorenzo bruno. This is him? - Yes. - Is there a photo? Is that him with my mom? Wait, are you telling me that my mom entered Witness protection because she testified against my father? - They were dating at the time. By all accounts, he was volatile. Your mom did a brave thing by testifying against him. Not a good guy, at least back then. He was caught up with a lot of dangerous people. - And now? - He's allegedly cleaned himself Up over the last several years. Who knows, maybe he's finally straightened out his life. - So he's out of prison? Do you think he's the one that killed my mom? - He's on the suspect list. - Along with who? - The other defendant. Here's a photo. Frank stefano, Notorious kingpin of the criminal operation He and lorenzo were running back then. - He looks mean. - Your mom helped put him away too. - Damn, mom. - Yeah, he's still doing time, but he has other that'll Do his dirty work for him. - Have you talked to any of them? - Like I said before, we're working all leads. It's not always straight forward, my team faces a lot of red tape. Have you given any more thought to my offer? - Sorry. I can't do this right now. - I put a form in there. Take a look at it whenever you're ready. All you'd have to do is just sign if you decide You want to take the offer. - Carter. You have to come. - Are you okay? - Someone was here. - Don't touch anything, I'm on my way. How you holding up? You've reconsidered my offer? I think you'll realize it's the right decision. This is teresa's signature. - Yeah. She signed it And look where it got her. I'm not gonna make the same mistake. - The program works. Now, what happened to teresa shouldn't have happened, But it was because she left the witness protection program To return to her old life. - One time. She left once to visit her own mother after 21 years. You should've found a way to keep her safe. - You're right. - I do agree with you on one thing: Whoever was after my mom seems to be coming after me. I can't stay here. - So what's your plan? - Visit my grandmother before it's too late. - You're going to new jersey? - Tomorrow. I bought a plane ticket. - I can't stress to you how bad of an idea that is. You'll be walking straight into the lion's den. - I've already thought it through. No one there knows me. And besides, nobody is going To expect teresa russo's daughter to suddenly Show up in town. - Clearly somebody knows you Well enough to be targeting you. I can't keep you safe, do you understand that? - I just... I have to do this. I need to know who my mother was and while I'm there, I'm gonna find her killer. I'm not bound by red tape like you. - Are your people almost done? I need to pack. - Will you let me drive you to the airport tomorrow? Hello? Hello? Look, I don't need no perverts calling my... - Hi. Is this jacqueline armstrong? - Who's asking? - My name is elena matheson, I'm the daughter of an old Friend of yours, teresa russo. - Teresa? I haven't heard from her in ages. I didn't know she had a daughter. How is she? - That's actually why I'm calling you. I'm sorry to tell you that She passed away last week. - Oh. Now that's a shame. I wish we could have gotten together again, For old time's sake. - Do you still live in valley plain? - At this point, I'm never getting out. - I'm flying there tomorrow. - Oh! Well, you should come by for a visit, Where are you staying? - I'll probably just get a rental place. - Ah, nonsense. You can stay here. I mean, it's nothing fancy, But I've got a room to spare. - That's really nice of you, jacqueline. - Well, teresa was my best friend. It's the least I can do. And please, call me jackie. - Here, let me help you. - Oh, I'm good. - You sure about this? - Yes. I'm sure. - Elena, please understand that my hands are tied. I wish it could be different But my boss won't allow me to be Your handler once you leave. I won't be able To guarantee your safety. - You couldn't guarantee it anyway. - Wait. Where will you be staying? - With my mom's old friend, jacqueline armstrong. - Will you at least check in with me when you get there? Just a text to let me know you're safe. - Fine. - And the address Of where you're staying. And her licence plate number. Actually, if you could text me once a day, that would be great. - We're gonna be late. - Ah. - Elena! Is that you? - Yeah, hi. - Hi. I'm jackie. Come on, come on. Oh my gosh, look at you! - Oh... - Here let me take that... - Oh, it's really... - Oh, no, I insist. - Oh. - Okay, thanks. Okay, well... Okay, come on, let's go. Ooh, you got a lot of stuff. Welcome. Sit, sit, sit. You must be starving. - Oh, well... - I made my famous meatloaf, Everyone loves it. Oh, it's nice and hot. Okay, here we are... There it is. Okay, you've got hot, you've got cold, you're all set. - Thank you. - I couldn't believe it when you called. Yeah... But now that you're here, you have to tell me Everything about teresa. I mean, god rest her. We were inseparable growing up. Always had big plans to get out of this town but... Of course, teresa was the one to finally do it. I often wondered where she went, I felt like she fell off the face of the earth. - Oh... We've been in ohio. - Ohio? Why would she go there? - I don't think she had much of a choice. Mom was in witness protection because of something That happened before I was born. I didn't even know about any of this until she... Died. - Wait a sec, is this because of that trial where she testified? - Yeah. - That's crazy! You mean you didn't know anything about your family Or your mother's last name or any stuff like that? - I've never even met my grandmother... - Oh. - And... I hear she's not doing too well. - Sweet sofia. I heard she's over at greenpoint hospital. We can go visit her if you'd like. What's the matter? - I... It just hit me all of a sudden that she's so close. - I get it, it's a lot to take in. I'll tell you what, why don't you finish eating And then I'll show you to your room, you can get some rest, And we can talk more in the morning. - Thank you for everything, jackie. - Are you kidding? There's nothing I wouldn't do for teresa. Eat, it's good. It'll make you feel good. It makes me feel good. Hey. You okay? - I'm just starting to realize that to my grandmother, I'm a complete stranger. And I know she's really sick but... What if my going in there just gives her a shock so bad That it'll kill her? - Oh, honey, sofia's a tough one. I think she'll be overjoyed to see you. - No. No, I can't do this. - That's okay. If you're not ready now, we can come back another time, okay? - Okay. - Okay, let's go, come on. It's okay. - I'm sorry. It's okay, we'll come back another time. - Where are we? - It's your grandmother's house, It's where your mom grew up. - Aw... There's that picture of you and my mom standing On the lawn as teenagers. - Mm-hmm. - So who lives there now? - Oh, sofia still owns it, but I don't think anyone's Staying there while she's in the hospital. Come on. - Where are you going? What? Uh... - Ah. - I don't think we should be here. - Don't worry, Sofia used to keep a spare key hidden out here. - Are you crazy? - Relax. I think if you could inside the house it would help you Get to know your grandmother. Then you might feel more comfortable visiting her, okay? Key's gotta be here somewhere. - Oh. Hey there, kitty. Jackie. - What? Someone's been feeding the cat. - It's fine, don't worry so much. - Jackie... - You're right, we should leave. Let's go! - I'm trying to avoid breaking And entering here, can't you help? - I'm not sure what you want me to do. - There's gotta be a way to remotely access someone's Recorded video footage. I figured you feds must know how to do that. - Elena, you need to stay away from that house. - I know, that's why I'm trying to do this remotely. - Forget about that for a minute, this is dangerous. Anyone could be waiting for you there. - No one has a clue I'm here. - Don't be naive, elena, someone broke into your house. It is possible, even likely, they know where you are. - Look, if you're telling me that there's not a way To remotely access those cameras, then I'll just have To go in there to see for myself. - No, that's not what I'm saying. - Don't you get it? This is my mom's childhood home, For all we know, she went there That last day and that footage Could tell us if anyone one was with her. - I hear what you're saying, but there's an official way These things should be done. - You and your red tape. - Elena... - Come in. - You doing okay? - Yeah. - That was a great day. We ditched our last class and went to the movies. We snuck into dangerous minds and ate our weight in candy. - Can I ask you something? - Shoot. - I was thinking and, you were right, it would be good For me to get inside of my grandmother's house. I do want to try to get to know who she is. Is there any way you might know of another way in? - I don't know. I didn't realize before that there would be cameras. - Yeah, but the cameras could be a lot of help to us. Maybe they picked up something that could show me what happened To my mom, like someone following her. - I do know of one other way through a basement window... At least that's what we used to use back in the day. - It isn't locked? - The latch was busted back then. I used to help teresa sneak through there whenever We'd be out past curfew. Could be worth a shot. - Can I borrow your car? - Ugh, keys are hanging by the door, Don't tell me when you leave, I don't need to know anything about it. - Come on... I can't believe you're here. Thanks for bailing me out. Aren't you going to say something? For god's sake, can you just say something already? - Do you need me to tell you how reckless That stunt was that you pulled? - I wouldn't call that a stunt. - How it cost you whatever anonymity you had and revealed Your blatant lack of concern not only for yourself but also For your friend jacqueline and for me. - I'm sorry. - You're not my only case, you know? But you're the only one I have to drop everything For and get on a flight to new jersey! - I'm not your case at all. I left the program, remember? - I remember. I made a promise to your mother, to always look out for you. So here I am I'm driving you back to jacqueline's for the night. - What? Is that hair... Is that my mom's hair? - Change of plans. You're leaving with me. We'll get the next flight home. - But... I'm not leaving. - There's been two obvious threats made against you, Three if you count that person lurking around your front door. You just got arrested and you're staying With a woman you barely know. - My mom knew her, That's enough for me. - Your mother also knew killers! I'm sorry. I'm just worried about you. I want you to come back with me now So we can arrange a fresh start. - And I want to go back inside. - Sorry, I tried to quit, but I just get so nervous With these things. - The house is clear. - Now will you tell me what's going on? - Show her the note. - What note? - It's confidential evidence. I'd still feel better If you'd come with me. - Oh, no, no, no. Elena's on her own journey, she needs answers. - I'm sorry for what happened today and I apologize For bringing you all the way out here. I... I realized I haven't been going about things the right Way but I do need more time. - What about tonight? - We'll lock all the doors and the windows And won't let anybody in. - Good plan. Do you have a couch I can crash on? - Sure. - You're gonna sleep here? - You need a toothbrush or anything? - I have what I need. You got me out here, now I have To make sure you stay safe. - I'll make us dinner. - Sounds great. - I'll help you. - Okay, why don't you go get settled? - Jackie... With everything that's going on, I completely understand if you don't want me staying here. I'll leave any time. - Absolutely not. I meant it When I said I wanted to help. Anything for teresa's daughter. - When I went to my grandmother's house, I found something that I want to show you. Do you know who this is? - That's lorenzo bruno, your... - My father. - He and my mom had a confrontation the day she died. I think he had something to do with her death. I think that he's wanted revenge Ever since my mom testified against him. What do you know about the trial? - Oh, well, I was there. Your mother was the star witness for the prosecution. The jury found her sympathetic because she was emotional And visibly pregnant. Hey, you know what? Technically, you were there too. - Carter says that maybe lorenzo Changed after all these years. Do you think that could be true? - Honestly? I think you can change the suit but not the man. Ready? - Freeze! Stand up, slowly. - Which is it, freeze or stand up? - I'm sorry. I was sleeping pretty hard. I thought someone broke in. Let me have one of those. - So, I was doing some research online and came across lorenzo's company. They're real estate developers And it looks like they're hiring. So I thought I'd apply, See if I can get an interview And guess what? - You did. - Interview's tomorrow. - Are you nuts? - I thought you might want to give me a ride. - No! This is a terrible plan, It invites trouble to find you! Look, I'm doing what I can to keep you safe, But every minute you're out of the program, Your life is on the line! - Look. - Is that lorenzo? - Yeah. He was at my grandmother's house harassing My mom the day she was killed. You need evidence, right? Something to prove it was him? Well, all I'd have to do is gain access to his office, Take a peek at his schedule, Maybe his location history on his phone. That way we could at least prove Whether or not he was at the hospital during that time. Stop shaking your head. I wish I could get past this but I can't. My mom was all I had. After she died I found out that everything I knew was a lie. I need to find out the truth. - Maybe we can work together, but you have to be careful. Don't take any unnecessary risks. Can you promise me that? - Yes. - That feeling in your gut... Trust it. And I'll give you a ride. - Are you looking for the receptionist? - Yeah. - She should be right back. - Thanks. - Here you go, have a good one. Bye. Do you want to order a coffee while you wait? - I shouldn't, I'm here for a job interview And I'm already nervous enough. - Okay, let me guess... Administrative assistant? - No. - Engineer? - No. - Uh... Marketing department? - Mailroom. - Okay, mailroom's the best. Seriously, there's a great group of people down there. And hey, we all got to get our foot in the door somehow, hm? I'm allie by the way. - Elena. How long have you been working here? - Just a few months. Only part-time, though. The rest of the time I take classes over at the college. - Oh, she's back. Hey. Good luck. - Are you gonna wish me luck? - I'm gonna remind you of your promise. Now remember to call me... - If I feel threatened. Got it. - Alright. Go on. - Seventh floor... I have mail for mr. Bruno. - No one enters mr. Bruno's office without an appointment. Especially not someone from the mail room. Is that it? - Here's that file. Tell allison to double-check the numbers. - Oh, you idiot. Get it together. You've been quiet the whole drive. How'd it go? - I saw him today... Lorenzo. I thought I was prepared but it was just so sudden And he was just... There and... I probably drew too much attention to myself staring At him like an idiot. - No. Probably feels worse than It was because you've been Playing it over in your head. Did he recognize you? - No. No, at least there's that. - But his assistant is going to be a major road block for us, She's like a guard dog. - Then you'll have to get into his office when she's not there. You know, you don't have to do this right now? Especially not after the day you've had. - I'm okay. - Hi! I... Do you remember me from work? - Of course, gosh, hey! Congrats on getting the job. - Thanks. Do you work here too? - Yeah, I intern here part time For school credit. And some day, I'll be a nurse. - That's great. - Are you, um, visiting someone? - Yeah, kind of. My grandmother is sick but I've never actually met her But I really want to go and visit her. I'm just afraid that the shock might be too much. - Hm. You want some friendly advice? - Yeah, please. - Go see her. People are stronger than you think. Look, I mean, if you're not feeling ready for it, I can check in on your grandmother The next time I come in. I can text you and let you know how she's doing. - You would do that? - Sure, it's no problem. Give me your phone. Alright, there. You have my number and now I have yours. I can't thank you enough for this. - Any time. I'll see you at work, okay? - Yeah. Don't start. - What the... Let me. - What is that? "don't make the same mistake your mom made." - I saw him, I saw him! I was taking the trash and... I... I saw the bastard That threw it and I chased him down the street but he jumped The fence and I lost him! - Well, did you see his face? - No, he had a hoodie pulled up. What's that? - "you're a smash at your new job but that Disguise isn't fooling anyone." - Time to move. We need to leave. - Leave, what? No, what about jackie? - Don't worry about me. - Gut check, you made a promise. - Jackie, I really... - No, the most important thing Is your safety, just go, I'll be fine. - Grab what you need for work tomorrow, we'll come back for The rest of your stuff later. - Go. - Things are getting worse. That brick is the last straw. We'll get rooms at this motel for now but we don't have a lot of time. I need to identify this threat and take it out. - Don't you think if this person wanted to kill me, They would have done it already? - That the theory you're Willing to stake your life on? - Well, I'm... - Psychopaths are like cats, Some like to play with their prey before they make their kill. - Now it's a psychopath? - I'm no profiler, but just look at the facts. Those little notes? Pure egocentrism, Aggressive arrogance, impulsivity... - It's obviously lorenzo. - We don't know that for sure! - I just... I just hate that I have to leave jackie like that. - Jackie will be fine, you're the one they're after. With you out of the house, Jackie won't be in danger anymore. Maybe this will finally convince you not To let your guard down with new people. - Let my guard down? - Giving your number to strangers like That girl at the hospital? - She wasn't a stranger, I met her at work. - You didn't think to mention that coincidence before? A girl from lorenzo's office Just happened to be at the hospital the same time as you? - You really think they could both be involved? - Yes! In order for me to keep you safe, I need you to not tell Anyone, not jackie, not that girl from work, where you'll be Staying, do you understand that? - Yes. - I need you to cut off contact with both of them, completely. Only until we figure out who's behind this. Deal? - Fine. - Now come on, let's go get some rooms. 7:40! Okay... Calendar... Come on. Yes! 4:15 train to new jersey, gotcha. - And if you get in a bind, you can call me. - Don't worry, I can handle it. - Just doing my rounds. - You're new here, aren't you? - Uh... This elena, she started in the mailroom last week. - I try to make a point of meeting all new hires, I like to know who I have working for me. - How nice. - I usually ask my assistant To schedule new employees For a meet-and-great with me. I apologize that we have seemed To have overlooked that, But we'll correct that now. Portia, will you block out some Time this week for me To meet with elena, here. - You can do Thursday. - Thursday it is. See you then. - See you. - Hey, what's up? I texted you earlier. - Sorry, I've been really busy. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I just wasn't expecting that. - I should've warned you about the meet-and-great. Many have tried but I'm afraid there's no getting out of it. Is that why you were in there? - Me? Uh... No, I'm... I'm helping lorenzo with his side project. I could really use the extra cash. - What is it? - I can't really talk about it, He made me sign an nda Oh. Hey! That's a really pretty scarf. It reminds me of one my mom used to have. - It's nice, isn't it? I actually just picked it up. You can borrow it sometime if you'd like. - Thanks. - Going down? - No, I better finish up here. - See you later. - You have your meeting with lorenzo today, right? - Unfortunately. - No, this is good. What you found in his schedule Proves that he was trying To cover up the fact That he was in town When your mom was killed. - Yeah, but how am I just Supposed to ask him about that? - You can't, not outright, but having a one-on-one Conversation is a good start. See if you can get him to talk about allie. - Allie? - Yeah, you said they had A private meeting. - Yeah, one she claimed to have Signed an nda for. - See if he'll say anything else about it. - Find out what their relationship is. - Okay. - Come in! Come on in. Close the door, please. Have a seat, elena. Do you want something to drink? - I'm fine. Thank you. For doing this, I mean. - It's important to me that my Employees feel like they know me. That they can come to me at any time for any reason. - People seem to enjoy working for you. Like allie, for example. I mean, I'm guessing she's been working for you for a while If you trust her enough with an important side project. - Loyalty. You can't buy that. Well, actually, you can. So, never mind. What about you, where'd you grow up? - Uh... I grew up in the midwest, but most of my family Lives on the east coast, that's why I moved out here. - Your parents? - My mother passed away and I never knew my father. - You're like me. My mother died when I was young, My father was never in the picture. It's hard in life without having someone To guide you to the right path. - You seem to have done pretty well for yourself. - Yeah, I'm doing well now. But it's been a long road to get here, a lot of bumps, Lot of dead ends. - How'd you turn it around? - First, I had to figure out who I was, but once I did that, I realized that I was good at something: Business. If I could put that to work for me in the right way, I knew that I could be successful. - You seem to have it all figured out. - Not quite. What about you, elena? I'm getting the sense that you don't like Talking about yourself. - I'm not that interesting. - What is it you want? What are you doing here? Why work at l.B. Corp? - It's a great company with lots of opportunities. - I know that, But what do you want? - What do I want from you? - Be honest. - You really want to know about me? - My name is elena russo. My mother was teresa russo, she was murdered the day that She came to visit my grandmother After hiding from you for 21 years. You are my father and I think you killed her. - Elena! - You can't run in here! - Elena, stop! Elena! Elena! - Come on... Answer! Allie! - Freeze, drop your weapon! Are you alright? - I'm okay. What just happened? - We got her. Can you stand? - Come on. Come on. Damn it! - Is that blood? - Uh, huh. - Oh god, where is she? - She's gone. - That's her phone. - It's evidence now. Come on, let's get you some place safe. Stay close. - I can't believe you were right about her. - You're in shock, you should rest. - Do you think she's acting for lorenzo? - We can't say until there's a thorough investigation. We need to get her in custody. Until that's done, I'm afraid You'll have to keep laying low. - I... That might be tough after what happened today at work. - What happened? - You know how I was meeting with lorenzo? Well, he kept asking me questions, prying and eventually I just snapped and I told him everything. - What's everything? - I told him who I am and that I think he killed my mom. - Holy... - I know. I know I shouldn't have let my emotions get the better of me But you should have seen him. He paints himself out to be some nice guy then he acts Like he wants to help everyone but I know he's a killer and... She's probably working for him. And I was their special project. - We don't have proof of that yet. - You have allie's phone, There's probably something on there. - Yes, you're right. I'll have to get to the lab for processing but it'll take Time, which we don't have. - I'm so sorry. I screwed everything up today. - No, you did the opposite, you brought us a break in the case. We have a lot for our team to go on. - What if we turn the tables on lorenzo? - What do you mean? - Well... What if we asked him for another meeting? One we could record. - It could work. We could play the allie's phone card, make it sound like We found something on it, something incriminating to him. - We'll do it at jackie's place, I'll set it up. - Wait. If we do this, we have to think It through, every detail. The last thing I want to do is put you in even more danger, Especially with allie still on the loose. - We have to do this, it's our only shot. Look, you saved my life today. I won't be reckless. - Good. - So is that a yes? - Ready? - I'm nervous. - Oh... Hey, is that thing live? - Yeah. - Wow, big brother in my own house. - I really appreciate you doing this, jackie. - For you and teresa? Anything. - Is that clock right? Because he was supposed To be here at seven o'clock. What if he's not coming? - There are a million reasons why he could be late. Here, drink this. Go on, Bottoms up. - Easy on the wine. Do you think he's late Because of traffic? Definitely, It's always traffic. There's construction, Have you been on the turnpike? - Carter. I don't know, Have you taken me there yet? I have. Is traffic bad in new jersey? - What's that? Construction, people, cars. Everyone's got two cars now, why? Traffic after seven. - Have you id'd the victim? Is he dead? I'll meet you there. - What's up? - He's not coming. I was stupid to think that this could work. - You're not stupid. You can't control chaos and lorenzo's nothing but chaos. - Um, no. I wouldn't describe him as that. He's more calculated. - Trust me. - How do you know so much about lorenzo anyway? - I used to know him quite well, Better than anyone. And he knew me too, Like, really knew me. What we had was special. Until teresa had to come and ruin it! - What... What are you doing? - You wanted answers, right? I mean, that's why we're here. Ooh, are you feeling a little foggy? - Mm-hmm. - 'cause I gave you my special vintage, I put a little Something extra in it for you. Lorenzo had an annoying soft spot for teresa, But not even she could compete with what we had. I guess that's why she had to go get herself knocked up. Listen to me! This is important! I was loyal to him, even after what she did! I gave him everything, even a daughter of our own! - A daughter? - I wanted him to know how much I loved him but he was always Fixated on what he couldn't have: Teresa and you. He became obsessed. He started visiting sofia with the hope that the bitch Would come and visit one day. To be fair, she finally did. Wake up! - You and my mom weren't friends? - Oh, we were at a certain point, but after the accident, I mean, things could never be the same. We both moved on. We just moved on with the same guy. - Where's your daughter now? - Oh, you met her. My beautiful, allie. Oh, no, no, no. I can't let you call carter. I'll take care of him next. The same way I dealt with lorenzo and teresa. - You killed my mom? - She got what was coming to her. Like mother, like daughter. - Seems like a lover's spat to me. - How do you figure? - Final text on his phone Says it all. - Did you run a trace on the number? - Unregistered, it's a burner phone, But there is something else. Excuse me. Vape pen, we found this under the passenger seat, Must have fallen between the cracks. We swabbed it for dna, The lab's working on it now. - Call me with the result, Keep me posted on the victim's status. - Will do. - Why do all this? - Teresa put lorenzo away for years. That was years away from my daughter's life! Why did he think that barista job Would make up for everything... - You and your mother ruined our lives! What was that? Oh! It's your little rent-a-cop friend, Looks like he's on his way back. Do you want me to respond? - Elena, are you alright? - Uh-huh. Is she... - She's dead. - No... Mom... - Allison armstrong, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against You in a court of law. You alright? - Yeah. Any news about my dad? - Looks like he's gonna pull through. - Well, I have to head out, new case assignment. - They'll be lucky to have you. - I wish you'd consider joining the program but... You'll keep in touch? Text me, let me know How you're doing. - I will, I promise. - Oh, and elena, if you ever need anything... - Thank you. - Thank you. - Do you mind if I join you? Alright, thanks. I want to say I'm sorry, for everything that's happened, Especially with allie. I knew jackie had been feeding her lies for years but I didn't Realize how bad things had gotten. - Maybe, serving time will do Her some good like it did for you. It changed your life. - I hope so. - What is it? - You look so much like teresa. - I saw a video of you harassing her at sofia's House and that was the last day she was alive. - I went there to feed sofia's cat. I've been taking care of her ever since sofia Went into the hospital. I never expected to see teresa there. I just wanted to talk to her, but... I know it's my fault because of who I was And how I treated teresa back then. I didn't deserve anything from her. I don't deserve anything from you either. - Is this a dream? - It's all real. I'm right here, grandma. - Pretty girl, tell me... Tell me everything. - Well, my name is elena. Elena sofia, actually. I was born October 14, 2001. Mom and I lived in cincinnati, It was always just the two of us. And she really was the best. Difuze
