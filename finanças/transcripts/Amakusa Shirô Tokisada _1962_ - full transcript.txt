TOEI COMPANY LTD In 1637, the Tokugawa Shogunate issued a mandate to severely restrict the spread of Christianity. In the provinces of Kyushu, Shimabara and Amakusa, Christianity was widespread, particularly among the peasants. These Christian peasants endured extreme suffering under the yoke of government oppression. Yozaemon Naruji, raise your head. That's quite a magnificent face you have. I can see why the local peasants follow you. Yoza, it seems you've collected 30 barrels of rice for land tax. Unfortunately, as I mentioned the other day, we've had such a poor crop... we have no rice to give. I don't care about your poor crop. Where's your payment? For the past three months, our family hasn't eaten a single decent meal. Where's your payment? You don't have your taxes? That's correct. How dare you insult Lord Tanaka! Have you no respect for samurai pride? Wait! Are you his daughter-in-law? She's pregnant? Yes, she's in her sixth month. Get out of the way. It must be hard surviving on scraps. I'll take her into my custody. We don't want her malnourished... ...could harm the child! Please wait! Wait! You must be too weak to sow your seed, eh? I'll have to inspect your wife's body myself then. Let's go. Please wait! I beg you!... Please! Father, I'm going! Where are you going? To get my wife back. No! They'll just imprison you too. Mother... I can't stand it. I refuse to bear it anymore. We have no more rice... to pay their endless taxes. Have you forgotten the teachings of the Christ? Though they're evil... we mustn't use force to fight force. If a man strikes your right cheek, turn to him the other. How long can we go on like this? He's right. How long do we wait... for a miracle to save us? We believed you... and endured the pain... the endless suffering We must pray. Let us pray... From deep in the pit of darkness... we call out to you, God. God, please hear our prayer. God, witness to this suffering and injustice... God, give us strength to resist. Everyone... They won't be satisfied. They will come tomorrow to take someone else. For now, we'll take shelter at Kazuko's house. We'll be dispersed. What will become of us? Even if separated... our hearts will be one. Please pray in God's name. Let's go to Amakusa to meet with Shiro. Shiro of Amakusa. I think... it's a bad idea. He's well known... but could be false. As soon as possible, go and take refuge at Kazuko's house. I don't even have the strength to save myself. I'm at a loss... how to survive in this world of pain. I'm unable to lead you anymore. If the young Amakusa Shiro... is truly the leader, the people say he is... then it's truly a blessing. Sanzo! Father, I'm going all the same. Sanzo, please stop. I'll get Ume back and catch up with you. Please wait, Sanzo! If it doesn't work out... we'll meet in heaven. Sanzo! Everyone, please stop him! AMAKUSA SHIRO TOKISADA (The Rebel) Produced by: OKAWA Hiroshi Planning by: TSUJINO Kimiharu - NAKAMURA Yurin Screenplay by: ISHIDO Toshiro - OSHIMA Nagisa Photography by: KAWASAKI Shintaro Music by: MANABE Riichiro Fight Choreography: ADACHI Reijiro CAST: OKAWA Hashizo TACHIKAWA Sayuri OKA Satomi KAWARAZAKI Choichiro MIKUNI Rentaro OTOMO Ryutaro Directed by: OSHIMA Nagisa Shiro... My daughter-in-law is with child. Please answer me, Shiro... Is it God's will to murder a child? Killing a child is against God's will. My son took a sword and went to get his wife back. Was his action righteous? Of course. Your son is carrying out God's will. I see. I tried to stop my son. I understand your feelings well. However, fighting alone... would be fruitless... and would mean certain death. I understand very well. What may fail when tried by one, can succeed when many act as one. Do you understand? Shiro, Kakuzo's younger brother has been arrested. The rumor is... when they took him, they confiscated his things. How did they find out? Shiro... Tamezo! I'm going to rescue Sanzo. Absolutely not! They'll kill you! Not only that, the village will pay dearly for your actions. What will you do? Rather than waiting to be killed... in time the people will choose death. Until that time, we must bear it quietly at all costs. We must wait for the right time. It's true. Soon the western sky will glow red. We will never see our homes again. They will burn them... the mountains, grass and trees will burn with them. That was the prophecy of our Lord, who died 26 years ago. A saviour will be born and save the people. I believe that you're that saviour. Shiro... I am just an ordinary Christian. Burn... everything... just burn! Okiku... How did you find out about this place? Tamezo, did you tell her? Yes. I told you not to endanger women and children. Shiro... They've taken my father to Lord Tanaka's again. Don't worry. I'm sure he went there as a painter. Did my father really betray Christ? I don't know. However, he did seem to be very upset. I wish Christianity had never existed. My father never sleeps well. He's constantly talking in his sleep. He cries out 'betrayal'. You're always so busy consoling others, you never pay attention to me. I'm sorry. Shiro... We're leaving now. We'll try to regain our spirits, then search for my son and his wife. Please don't overexert yourself. Yozaemon... we will meet again soon. Shiro... Even if my father were to betray you... would you still accept me? You're not your father... you're you. You can still be saved by God. I'm painting this in the western style. Asian art is known for its portrayal of beauty. It's incapable of showing... the true human nature. In order to show true human nature... Are you saying I'm ugly? That's not what I meant... Have you really abandoned Christianity? I abandoned Christ in order to cause this frequently agitated soul to suffer. However, I now believe I can communicate with society through painting. You see, painting allows the human soul and spirit to... Did you really abandon Christ? I understand Amakusa Shiro has been visiting your home. I was hoping to marry my daughter to Shiro... Lord Mondo! It's nice to see you again, Emosaku. Don't despise me. So... Has your wound healed? We arrested another one last night. What about the arrest of their leader? Those miserable peasants don't have any rice. Instead, they had a crucifix. I heard you were lenient with them. Not at all! Open the door. When I stripped her, she was wearing a cross underneath. A naked female rebel is useless. Emosaku... Do a painting of that naked woman. I will post it everywhere, as an example to all the Christian peasants. I'm currently working on Lord Tanaka's portrait. Clever excuse... Why are there so many Christians in Shimabara and Amakusa? Because of the nominal land taxes we collect, I hope they aren't converting to spite us. If we eradicated the Christians, we'd be able to collect more taxes. Isn't that so? Yes, sir. The Edo Shogunate feels our persecution is too lenient. This is my plan... which may shock even you. Villagers... for following Christianity and thus disobeying the laws of Shogun Ieyasu... you will be punished. Though humans like us... Christianity will not be tolerated. Take these words to heart, and witness your fate. Damn them! That's quite a plan. It's called straw dancing. Straw dancing? Shinbei... you have yet to devise a unique type of execution. He's right. Shinbei... When Amakusa Shiro was a samurai, everyone knows he was a friend of yours. To avoid any misunderstanding... you should put more effort into the destruction of Christians. I appreciate the warning. Emosaku... I want you to paint the straw dancing. Do it! I said do it! I see you are not totally reformed, Emosaku. You'll have plenty more straw dancing to paint. You have a painter. Make him paint. Yes, sir! Force him! Do it! Do it now! I will not do it! Capture him! Shoot! Father! Run! Father! In there! Forgive me! Why didn't you warn me this time? Twelve Christians were captured and executed. It wasn't supposed to be like that. I'm sorry. Listen, Shiro... Actually, there's a new officer from Edo. He wants to stamp out Christianity and he's watching me. I've been passing information... because of our long friendship. But now... continuing... would cost me my position and status as a samurai. It's impossible to help you anymore. Then... I can't rely on you anymore. Till now, with the information you provided, I was able to save the lives of many peasants. Shiro, I'm becoming disillusioned about being a samurai. I want to be of greater help to you and to the peasants. Shinbei... I hope you are serious. Shiro... I need you to gather a large group of Christians to create a riot. I hope you're telling the truth. What! Don't you trust me! I'm not questioning you, but this is a grave matter. I must be sure your commitment is absolute. So Shiro... Did you really think I didn't know... what you were planning? When we met... you never mentioned it. But... your eyes told me... to give up my samurai status. Did you think I hadn't noticed?! I've made up my mind... to face the risks. It's what you wanted. Be honest. Tell me you're happy. I'm very happy, Shinbei. Actually, we already have about 100 Christians in the castle. The plan was to attack in unison, but until now we lacked a strong ally on the inside. Who is the contact? The door man, Tsunekichi. He's in on it, too. You're a scary individual! I'll be back. What's the matter, Okiku? Why don't you answer me? Why are you so sad? I'm sorry. Tell me... tell me. Lighten your heart... tell me what's causing you such pain. The samurai who came to arrest father... He forced you! He violated you! Okiku... Some have pure bodies... but their hearts are soiled. Others may have soiled bodies... but their heart is pure. It wasn't you who was soiled... by a cowardly act of violence. It was that samurai. It wasn't you. That's a lie. Was there no way... you could have resisted? Have you decided... to renounce the Lord Jesus Christ. I have. How dare you embarrass me in front of the Lord! Take over! I renounce him. Tell us Shiro's whereabouts... at the very least. If you don't.. you'll never be set free from here or from the Lord's anger. I leave him to you. Murderer! Kill me! Crazy fools! Shinbei... Your wife has sent me a strange request. Please arrest Shiro as soon as possible. Is it true that you met with Shiro? Did my wife tell you that? No. Shinbei... You must not be angry at your wife. She is trying to protect you from danger. I understand you refused to help them. However... I can incarcerate you... whenever I wish. You and your wife are Shiro's close friends... It's an indisputable truth. You have one way... of saving yourself in this matter... that's to arrest Shiro yourself. If you don't act soon, I will arrest him. Be prepared if I arrest him. Lord Mondo... Emosaku never gave us Shiro's whereabouts, but he gave up one name... Sankichi of Higashiarie. I'm off. Wait! Emosaku, do you recognize me? You're Shinbei. Right. Are you a Christian or not? Which is it? I have abandoned Christianity. I just couldn't paint the straw dancing. Will you do it this time? Please... Do you promise to do it? I can't do it. Emosaku! You have to paint Sankichi's execution. Understood? Please don't torture me anymore. Please... I'm an artist. It's only in times of peace... that art can save one's soul. Here in Shimabara... one's body and soul are lost. Bastard! I have abandoned Christianity. Bastard! - Hold it! Damn him! It does us no good, knowing that he's Christian. We're moving along smoothly. Got that? What are you doing with the rice? My child is hungry. You visit my house, but I'm unable to offer you anything. My wife and I take no pleasure in life anymore. The young people are being killed. It's over now. Please don't bother. What are you doing? I'm disgusted with being a farmer. I'm tired of being alive. Not this! How dare you speak ill of farming! Father, think about it! I think about it every day since my brother was killed. I can't take it anymore! To hell with martyrdom and God's will... This isn't God's world. Lord Matsukura... is real evil. I quit farming... I'll become a murderer. What are you doing? Don't say that! Don't stop me! I've become the devil! This may go against the teachings of Christ... but I vow to kill Lord Tanaka and commit suicide. I see... You have made your decision. I would like to join you, but... Is it because you've abandoned Christianity? That's correct. You shouldn't even be talking to me. Don't talk about it anymore. We are not Christians defying the government... but a group of peasants... who are being starved to death. That's right. Will you let us join you? Grandfather! Listen to me... I've killed in battle. You people are farmers. You don't know how to use a sword. As Christians, you discarded your swords long ago. I'm no longer able to fight... however, I can teach you how to use a sword. You won't slaughter any tax officials with technique like... that! It's not a tree. See your parents' murderer... your child's murderer! Everyone! You show great skills. As I expected, Shiro. What's the purpose of swordsmanship training? Are you planning... to use it in an attack? That's right. We are going to kill Lord Tanaka. Are you prepared to die? Absolutely. Shiro, let's do it! Don't be hasty. It's not time yet. When we rise in revolt, Christian peasants must attack... as one! Our supporters are waiting in the castle. In addition, Nagasaki... Shirato... all our comrades in Kyushu must unite and stand with us! That day'll never come. Waiting won't hasten it. We must make it come. How do we do that? Shiro, show us the way! Tamezo, give up. Shiro doesn't know... how it feels when one of your own family dies. Tamezo, follow me. The words I speak are not empty. Shiro... at dawn they'll target Sankichi's house. Emosaku succumbed to torture. Tamezo, can you go to warn them? They may already have the place surrounded. If you make it in time, tell them to run. Run? Of course. You just heard... plans to attack are moving forward in secrecy. It mustn't start until everything's in place. D'you understand? Yes. How are things in the castle? As far... as I know... there are a lot of complications. I've met with everyone, including Tamekichi. Everything should unfold... within four or five days. I thought Shinbei had a mistress... as he was sneaking out late at night. I had no idea... I figured it out recently. I'm a foolish wife. I'm pleased to see you again. Please forgive the surroundings, but... he's fond of this place. I see... my situation with regard to Mondo... has caused you great concern... I'm very sorry. I'm prepared. Shiro... is an old friend. I've been talking to him. You'll excuse us... we're not very well off... but... please accept this small gesture. Thank you. People say... you work to help the suffering. Yet some of us... still have all this. Please allow me to take this... to give to those who are starving. Of course. Mother. Thank you. Where did you get this? What's the matter? Emosaku betrayed us again... Tamezo told us. Tamezo was here? I won't have you marry the daughter of such a man. She should run away. She's so stubborn! He took Kakuzo and Yozaemon with him and went to Sankichi's home. What? I see. Father, we should go too. Alright. Shiro... pray at the altar of God. Remember the sufferings of Christ? Shiro... Why do you seek bloodshed? Are you trying to be like Tamezo? It's not like that. I'm being forced into this. The people are gathering at Sankichi's home. At this point, the only way is through death. I understand... the pain that Sankichi and the others are experiencing. Because we're Christians... should we run and hide. On top of that... taxes are so heavy, we can't even feed ourselves. Our faith in martyrdom is a waste. After witnessing the pain and suffering Okiku endured, I want to kill every human alive. I've endured it so long! Still, I felt it was too early to strike. However, now I will go. Whether I live or die, win or lose... I want to join them and share their fate. Shiro... Opposing the rule of law... is a sin in the eyes of Christ. Our saviour will punish you severely. You're wrong. If the missionaries were here, you'd be expelled. Shiro... Are you renouncing Christ? No, I'm not... Mother, listen. If what you say is correct, the peasants of Shimabara have abandoned Christianity too. For me... this decision... is not about Christianity. For me... it's to fight with my countrymen... the forsaken peasants of this land. Death for God's world... is purer than living in a world like this. Shiro! Would you die and leave me behind? Please forgive me. Kiku... will you join me? Yes! Please save me! Please save me! How dare you! Please save me! I'm a farmer, too! Kill him! So... how does it feel to kill? If you feel like that each time you kill... you'll never kill Lord Matsukura. I don't recall seeing you before. And you don't seem like a Christian. However, we are grateful. You saved us. Whatever your reason... will you join with us? Christian or not... or Buddhist... it matters not. It's in your stand against Lord Matsukura... that I find common cause. It seems... you are a ronin. I'm just a wanderer. No need to fear me. Everyone, the die is cast! There is no turning back. Break into two groups. The first group... inform our allies in Shimabara and Amakusa, who are waiting for news that the tax officials have fallen. Tell them that the time has come to hunt down and kill Lord Matsukura! The other group... will be made up of the best fighters. We'll raid Tanaka's warehouse for food and ammunition. We must claim our first victory! This man is our leader! Our leader! Do you remember my face? You are the ronin who sought a position as an officer. Please save me, as a fellow samurai. Silence! What do I care for official position! I'm going to take over this entire castle! Please spare me! Shiro! As you see, we have come this far. Please be our leader once again. You are the man in the prophecy. Shiro, we believe in you. You will never forsake us. Stop it! Open your eyes! He had us wait and endure long pain and suffering. Yet, we rose up and won without his help. This man sitting here helped us make our stand! So you are the infamous Shiro of Amakusa. You afraid to stand up against government officials? Who are you? I'm a wandering ronin. I have no name. Unlike you... I know how to judge a situation, and when to use my skills. How dare you. Amakusa Shiro, you draw against me? I don't think so! You took advantage of them... I didn't encourage them. I only assisted. You are a samurai with a lot of spirit. You are neither Christian... nor farmer. Who are you? Draw your sword... I might tell you. Draw your sword! Everyone! time is escaping... We must choose a leader! Shimabara Castle... knows now of our attack, and are preparing their defense as we speak. We must attack Shimabara castle as soon as possible. There's no time to delay. Stranger... your words are powerful. but are strong words what we need? Shiro, what do you say? My only prayer is that this be our finest battle and lead to victory. I don't care who leads. The verdict... is in God's hands. If it is what everyone wants... then I don't mind fighting under his leadership. However everyone... bear in mind the chances of taking the castle... are very slim! It will be difficult to get inside unless we coordinate with our allies inside and all fight to the death. I'll go now to contact them. Until you hear from me, do nothing! Understood? We will wait. We are ronin, who have renounced our samurai status... we've come to stand with you... to overthrow Matsukura. We are grateful. You are much needed reinforcements. Listen! Head out now!... to Shimabara and victory! Wait!... Wait-up! We promised to wait for Shiro's word. We must wait 'til we've made contact with our allies inside. In addition, by morning many more will join us. It's late. Everyone's tired. We must ensure a favorable result... we wait! We must go now!... the castle of Shimabara must burn immediately. This act alone will end the pain and suffering of the peasants. Time is of the essence! That's right! Let's go! Wait! We don't have the arms and weapons we need. If we attack now... we'll just be target practice for their rifles. He's right! Everyone, have you forgotten? In battle one must always advance and attack first, to ensure victory. He's right! Kakuzo, don't be foolish! We're not fighting to win... win or lose... it will be God's will. It's sinful to shed unnecessary blood. Women and children know nothing of war! We must attack the castle's outer defenses now. We'll never get another chance! He's right. We have to strike now! Wait! Wait! Shiro! Let me through! What do you want? We are going to win! You must not attack. You'll just be picked-off by their rifles. Silence Shiro! You must obey my orders! It appears our Christian allies in the castle have failed! My contact's house has been occupied by officials. I tried to sneak in, but they've strengthened their guard. I could not get in! Is it true? Why are you here? I heard rumours... that the battle had already begun. I came to ask you to protect Shinbei. It's too late. Shinbei has already been arrested. Did you check the jail? Yes, I did. I see. Everyone, you've heard everything. My assumptions were correct. They've strengthened their guard. They're prepared and waiting for our attack. We must wait... until we're strong enough to defeat them. It's the only way! He's right! Shiro, look at this. From my wife and child... In order to free my heart to fight a losing battle, I killed them with my own hands. I cannot delay another minute. Everyone, we must attack now. Yes! We must attack now! Let's go! Please wait! Wait! Wait! Kiku! Kiku, my best friend... this is Shinbei's wife. Please take care of her. Hurry up! Is Shinbei going to die? Forgive me. I am doing what I must. I don't want you to die. It's too late. We've started a battle we can never win. Let's go! If you're sure it's a losing battle... then seek pardon from Lord Tadamon. Let's run now. Let's go! Father... How did you leave the castle? Why shouldn?t I be allowed to leave? You'd rather I were still locked up in jail? Christians in the castle were arrested, yet you're free. Damn! Kiku... go home and get my painting things. Hurry! Father, you came to paint fires? Hurry before the flames die down. Father! Father, it's madness to believe... you live just to paint such misery. No, I'm perfectly sane. That's why I can no longer believe in God and Christianity. Kiku... What happened to you when I was arrested... after that, how can you believe in God? What are you doing? Don't! It's only natural for a human to break under torture. Look at that empty sky. Can you assure me that heaven exists up there? If Christ truly exists, why can't good people live freely. Stop it. Kiku, I want to live and continue to paint. Kiku! Kiku... Like your new quarters? Why did you incarcerate me? Don't feign ignorance. You think I didn't know you were helping Shiro and the collaborator Tsunekichi? It's the truth, isn't it? I see... Alright. I won't lie. You're correct. However, don't expect me to inform on my comrades. Take him out. Look... We've captured all the Christians in the castle. Shinbei! How did you find out? Tsunekichi, did you tell them? Emosaku exposed... both of us... Tsunekichi, why did you! Shinbei... We tortured Tsunekichi every single day. He didn't know how painful it would be. Like Emosaku... all humans are weak. Shinbei... Consider it a samurai's mercy that I do not torture you. By the way Shinbei... where's your wife? We searched your home when we arrested you, but she wasn't there. We've been monitoring your house, but she's nowhere to be found. Did you send her to notify Shiro? I did not! Perhaps she went there on her own. Shinbei... Shiro's deceiving you. When your wife came to ask me to arrest Shiro, I sensed a love-hate relationship between them. That's a lie! If Sakura isn't at home... you must have arrested her. I'm not lying. I hear Sakura did go to see Shiro. Your facial expression tells me it's true. Mondo, the peasants are at the castle gate. What are you doing? Shinbei, how dare you! I'm their ally! I could not stand by... and watch you torture and exploit the weak! Silence! My lord... Could it be... Shinbei's words contain some degree of truth? Mondo... Even... for a Shogunate retainer... that's unacceptable. Lord, please save me! What do you plan to do? Reflect carefully before you answer. I'm going to kill the peasants... every last one of them. Don't be ridiculous. You'll never win. There's no way out. Until the Shogunate sends specific orders, this castle is locked down. But that dishonours me! It would appear to be so. Mondo... Does it please you... to see me dishonoured... by the Shogunate? Not really. Your political blunder is completely obvious... to everyone. Lord Mondo, please release me. Let me search among the peasants and challenge Shiro. Fight him? I'm going to kill him for betraying me. Kill him? - I'll kill him. Is that the truth? I'm not lying! Alright. Where is Shiro? Shinbei! Shiro!... you must run! Shinbei, help us! - You can't stay here! You must hurry! You can't win!... I came to warn you! You must withdraw!... Many will die! Shiro!... so long. Wait, Shinbei!... Sakura's with me. Have no fear! Withdraw! They're coming!... The soldiers are coming! What's happened? All Christians... are to be executed, by order. There must be 90,000 soldiers coming for us. They're heading for Shimabara Castle. We have to take Shimabara castle before they arrive. They're firing cannon! I see you're Dutchmen... Why do you help Matsukura? Answer me! Your religion has excommunicated you! Opposition to the government won't be forgiven! Fire! The world of God is much more forgiving... than the world of Christian missionaries. Amakusa Shiro and fellow Christians, listen well! A larger force will soon be here. If you abandon Christianity... and ask for forgiveness... for your rebellious crimes... we will release these three, by special dispensation! If you refuse... we will burn them to death at the stake! Mondo, hear this! Every one of us.... has lost a family member at the hands of your officials. We are not afraid to die. We are prepared to die for God's glory. This is our sacred vow! Life or death... is God's will. We are not afraid of dying! This is... it's our only option. Sakura! I'm Shinbei's wife, Sakura! I want to die with my husband! I once said that all Christians in Japan must unite in this fight. However, now that will never happen. This battle will begin and end with us... us alone. What awaits us... is death! Still we will not die in vain. We are pledged to do God's will even to death. If we fight... against the Shogunate's oppression here we will be completely overwhelmed... before day's end. Therefore I suggest we make our stand in a castle. There's a castle in South Arima. Once strong but now abandoned, it's called Hara Castle. If we hold that castle... with enough food, we'll have time to frustrate our rivals. At the same time... We will form our own religious community... with no distinction between peasant and samurai. We'll build an ideal world... one without death or hunger. And record everything... for history to see. As there is pain and suffering throughout this world, our battle will give hope and courage to all men. I recommend we make Hara castle our base. I'm against it. We'll end up dying in that castle... without causing Lord Matsukura any suffering. Why did we decide to take a stand and fight? We wanted to destroy our oppressor. That wasn't our goal. You're wrong! We were determined... to fight those who defied God and tortured and killed his servants. Tell me then... if Lords Matsukura and Terazawa begged forgiveness, would you forgive them? Yes. You're a fool! What have we been doing all along? You... you planned to run to Hara Castle from the start. You're wrong. It's because we can't take Shimabara Castle. Kakuzo is against, because he wants to kill. I oppose refuge in Hara Castle for a different reason. Why? It's not only Shogunate bullets, now even the foreigners are turning their cannon on us! We must split up... and fight small battles... without drawing attention to one place. Yoza... do you think... the Shogunate's simpleminded? They'll simply impose more pain and suffering on us. How do you plan to fight that? We have to wait for our chances. I asked you all to wait... but you didn't. There are no more chances for us. Shiro! Are you encouraging us to fight... knowing we'll all die in vain? Our struggle's been successful 'til now! Surely Lord Matsukura... has learned his lesson. Peace for us... is on the horizon. Shiro, let's lay down our weapons. This is a bad dream... My reckoning is come. Each and every one of you should treasure life. The time of war is ending. The years are turning and peace is coming. I see it. What painting is this? Is this what you were doing during the executions? It's people like you... who sap men's will to fight. Emosaku... did you betray Maruta and Regena to the castle officials? Liar! You're all mistaken... No one can see it. I've killed the traitor. We attack the castle at daybreak... arise... comrades! What's wrong with you? Say something!... Why aren't you moving? Come on! I killed... my wife and child to fight this battle. My parents were murdered. Not once have I thought about myself! Are you telling me that I've been wrong? Answer me! Comrades... no one chose to follow Kakuzo. We're following the true path. Let's down weapons and start again... in the true teaching of Christ. Force should not be used to fight force! Yoza... Christ's teachings are true. However, it's our duty to live by them even when it's inconvenient to do so. Sorry... you're hiding behind Christ's words, and trying to avoid God's true path. Tamezo... teach everyone a new prayer to Christ. Christ our Lord said, I am not come to bring peace on earth. I've come to stop the fighting... to bring order and discipline to the people. I've come to stop the fighting... to bring order and discipline to the people. Comrades... this man is crazy! He wants us all to be killed! What are you saying? When his mother and sister were murdered before your very eyes... did you see how he acted? I cannot follow someone... so heartless and inhuman. Let's disband! It's pointless fighting alongside this mad man! Sorry... but I can't allow you to delude them. I'm deluding no one. I'm representing the common will! Liar! Those are your own feelings. The feelings of the majority are different. For you to abandon the cause is forgivable. But I cannot forgive someone who urges the others... to such a cowardly path. Yozaemon, forget Shiro. Go to the castle and fight. If you can't do that... then follow this fool. You'll all die. The women will be stripped naked... and raped by the Shogun's infantry. You'll be walking... into a living hell. Be silent! - I will not! As you advance in your attack... you will all die! Give up your pretention... of manifesting God's glory for the edification of Japan's Christians. You'll be forgotten... ignored by everyone... you're nothing... nothing but a worthless samurai! You draw steel, Shiro. Come on. I will not follow Shiro, the weakling. I'll kill him, for refusing to kill... scum tyrants! Shiro! You're our leader... We need you. You are a man to be pitied. Shut up! I don't intend... to return to Shimabara alive. However... I'm also no fool to be persuaded by a selfish samurai! How dare you preach to me! What good are you to starving peasants, who would fight back in anger? Shut up! I will not fail. It's my destiny... to finish this mission. Interesting. Depart! On February 28, 1638 more than 37,000 Christian peasants, including Amakusa Shiro, were killed. The End
