yeah I can't clear it it's white noise they must have a debugging device down there this man says but they were on us they would pull that transmitter right off the window two guys going into the other room with like security probably making sure none of them take what's going on these guys on that paranoid we might be on to something very interesting Roy yeah but are we getting aesthetic if that happened 20 years ago even before Landry was built who could have foreseen that we would have this gentleman I would like to know the extent of the problem inland beyond the death of this one more the problem is is that every one of the five thousand people living in Landry could be dead within a matter of months right oldest treatments if I might here very still think if I can get in sync with the static rhythm they can drop it out we've got to evacuate all those people out of there John where do we stand legally now the minute you revealed a situation in Landry by evacuation or any other means you're going to have lawsuits that range into the billions of dollars there is a way to avoid it you all know Arnold / Stratton you know the work he's done for us in the past I've discussed our problem with him and he's worked out something that could be a solution we've got to get those people out of there we will but it can be done under circumstances that won't incriminate us Oh mister almost ready look there's any more medical cover up by me I think I should leave you don't think doctor you do whatever we need you to do or the AMA board of inquiry will receive more than a few anonymous letters those guys are in there as if some corporation they laundered money through our contacts a couple of times what are you having modded mister / Stratton it's probably just another heart conspiracy behind every closed or illusions if you want to know the truth I guarantee illusion guarantee you look like an accident and about trying to do and the feet they're playing with the jammer that they using is on a rotating frequency maybe they're writing a movie I can't get this we have to wait till you get home to drop off some of this noise electronically are they going there I don't know big guy is showing something to one of them and now he's taking a bottle of Y and living with his buddy the one we just packed in go home and hear what we've got oh wait a minute just wait wait a few minutes all right I'm right here nothing must be waiting for the two guys to come back was that car all you tell it this way Blake what kind of wine did you say that guy took on the road what do you mean uh-oh it was red turn off the lasers go see what have lights on no I don't want to my girl license plate I'll pop back on it I don't see there fasten my seatbelt what do you

he has go there find out why they were listening what they heard and what has to be done to keep them quiet these guys were pros that means at a prologue or something - just do what has to be done destroy the tape if there is one I don't want to know anything about originally had a lot of white noise so I ran from equalizer and the noise suppressor three times the original percent through the reel-to-reel display of cassette back to the reel-to-reel a little bit better yeah you can listen companies not only so some guy he's getting a half a million to do something to an entire population where there might be casualties and they're gonna make it look like an accident 10:45 February 29th what where I don't think it's 10:45 the guy says 10:45 t time Y T for time 10:45 is 10:45 look let's go back to Mart just before the feet and we'll see if we can find out where whatever is gonna happen is your company's not only out of the woods this next section clears at 85 I'm going upstairs for colder you anything those guys in chasing us in Firebird they're parked with run in the house where's your gun God the one I gave you last year I never got it boss never mind that fine a gun looks like a cigarette lighter but they'll know it's have done an excellent ounce let's go where are you doing I wanna hide this Romanian ace in the hole right back see anyone no one just their car meet again this way anyone else upstairs no why are you bugging in our meeting man we don't know what you're talking about who hired you oh really we thought you guys were burglars where's the tape you made of the meeting we don't know anything about any tape where's the tape you made of the meeting okay okay I'll tell you it's in the basement my house we lost them but recording off the area you get some backup units where's Michael I'm a detective : ladies Newman are you alright where's my you see who did it what husband Jesus Christ by the three days you lay in the Tollman you made holy the graves of all because we didn't try we was so warm music died makes me feel you're near it was music of my life is gone you say he stumbled into something interesting what did he mean I don't know I think that they were just trying to figure it out mrs. Newman does your husband have any underworld ties I don't know what you mean were they involved in any illegal activities no they were inventors they built electronic equipment they were just hired by some detective agency I don't know what difference does it make anyway I mean if he was a criminal what you guys just quit no no but you have to understand that your husband and his partner apparently chose a very dangerous way of life those two men you saw being I didn't really see him I mean I looked at him but I I couldn't see him you must remember something I saw Michaels eyes he was so frightened when Doug's body on the floor that's that's all I could see yeah well the fact is those two men were professionals they left no fingerprints here the car was rented to a John Doe and unless you can help us further frankly we're stuck mrs. Newman those two men we're looking for something in your house do you have any idea what it could have been I don't know could have been drugs no now why are you I don't understand what it is you're doing this is Newman we need to are you trying to say he deserve to be killed you're in the music business is that right well yes now what difference does that make we need a motive mrs. Newman and I have no idea what that motive could possibly be mr. Cole we speak to your daughter and I mean absolutely not I don't want her any more upset than she already is now she's still sleeping and she was when most of this happened I think it's time for you gentlemen to leave yeah Oh you know I said nothing about killing those two men he said do what we have to I sent you to find a tape recording where is it with the strength of copies we couldn't find the original we couldn't find anything with the cops that wouldn't sweat it it's a clean operation no witnesses no no it was a witness you know and you find the witness maybe she's sitting on it I want my cash and gone from here should I call over Stratton and tell him to call off February 29th I'll worry about the tape of the witness you contact over Stratton and tell him to proceed with the operation at a Landry without fail gentlemen you want your money I suggest you do whatever mr. Penhall has in mind to finish the job at hand do I make myself clear no no we can't well because I have to take Abby out of school again mother mother just don't worry okay listen someone's at the door all right I love you all so I'll talk to you tomorrow okay and don't worry is it Newman this is Nibin I'm father Ryan I was at your husband's funeral may I come in for just a moment oh yeah sure okay thank you what can I do for you now that I'm here are you going to be all right mrs. Newman I don't know I don't know where to start anywhere you weren't I've always put my life in the Lord's hands and allowed him to guide me but this is something that did I can't understand why he look those who attribute everything to God's will are wrong God cannot possibly pull all the strings every hour of every day there is free will there is evil I know but I can't understand why Michael I mean why what happened does it matter yes do the police know maybe it was just an insane act and there are no causes and there are no reasons he was Michael was an electronics engineer and he was working for some investigator that night something happened what I don't know what do you think I don't know it's just that maybe if you knew why your husband was killed it might ease your mind of it oh I wish I did I know that it did it will eventually come out and then when it does I guess I'll know you already know don't you know no where is it Burke look Brook where is it I don't I don't know what you're talking about where is what yes you do no III don't know Michael gave it to you and you are gonna give it to me ah listen I don't know what you're talking about yes oh I'm really very tired and I'd like to get some sleep if you don't mind Oh scream I scream more you scream the more gas you inhale the quicker you die the don't worry you won't feel a thing you pass out first Brooke all I have to do is turn this foul their oxygen pure life-giving oxygen gas oxygen gas it's amazing isn't can't see either of them one of them kills and the other saves it's your choice but till it be where is it where is it where are you then do the police have it you know the police don't have you see my Sabbath don't ever want to see your daughter again this is your last chance where is it you're gonna be dead in five seconds mr. Cole you have been a detective for quite some time now I assume hmm we must have some idea what he wanted well I don't how is that possible this guy almost killed you listen to me both of you this this guy was not here on a whim I mean he knew what he wanted he knew what he was doing just think how cautious he was even though he intended to kill you he never came out and said exactly what it was he wanted so if you really didn't know already he wouldn't reveal it to you on the slight chance that you might survive and again you got lucky oh yeah I got real lucky there's got to be some kind of a logical explanation Gary look your husband was playing at being detected not playing being a detective I told you that before he was hired what do you call what he was doing them spine bugging a room surveillance these things are for professionals a licensed private investigator or the police that's what we do when novice had no business doing what he was doing if that type of an action was necessary he should have just built his inventions and turned him over to an expert if he had done that just that little thing he'd probably be standing right here alive today well he's not he's dead and I want to know what you're gonna do about it without any concrete evidence or any really helpful ideas from you oh just what do you suggest I do mrs. Newman I'm sorry I don't mean to sound harsh but we've got a job to do and we're generally pretty damn good at it when we've got something to go on we'll keep trying let's go hey mr. Cole aren't you gonna provide some kind of protection for this woman I'll leave two officers here tonight I'll check and see how long I can assign them but you have to understand now I've got a problem if we tried to provide protection for every victim of a violent crime wouldn't have any police officers to go on duty but I know it's lousy it's also reality yeah but what if he finds our again you want my unofficial advice I'd get her out of town take her where nobody knows where she is and Aaronson I mean nobody that's no credit cards no checks nothing that can be traced to wherever you are even phone calls whatever it is these people consider important that just can't stay that way forever it'll pass huh you all right you know maybe some two months what do you want to do that daddy I just feel like screaming I don't want you to well she's dropped on a site not a trace it's February the 25th get everything we have keeping everything we have depends on nothing going wrong in the next four days the odds are she doesn't know anything about potatoes I don't play the odds I don't want guaranteed have you heard from always Stratton everything is on schedule that's why we must finalize the issue of this tape the dominoes are falling Ken I want that woman to be among them when they do I hope what was driving those what the hell he's doing some music sure honey Abby the night that Daddy called us did he say anything about where he was I don't think so what about the background could you hear anything in the background why didn't he say something why didn't he tell us something mommy I can't sleep me neither honey when you're some music okay magic always makes everybody sleep thanks a lot what my music makes you go to sleep no I'm not your music music no no what's wrong it's one of your daddy's tapes honey well he and Doug used to record their tapes at a slow speed well you know that said that yeah it could get a lot on each one and so when you play back normally and - oh my god mommy what happy this this tape could be what those men were looking for what's played again give me one day it's intuitive now that's $300 for four hours and we're only gonna use this equipment for a couple at the most all right but I'm gonna be right outside 10:45 on Friday February 20 Friday February 22 your company is not only out of the woods but you evacuate everybody left in Landry never comes up again and no one ever finds out what went down I wonder who Jeffrey Pearson's and how he died but there could be a thousand Landers I know but tomorrow we'll just go to the library and we'll find out where every town thank you it named Landry is and then we'll call information and find out if there's a Pierce family in any of them what's today's date honey today what I don't know honey why don't you just take the tape to detective Cole I don't trust him and besides he's in LA and by the time I could convince him of anything we'd be out of time I've only got this small late anyway yes Landry last name is Pierce no I don't know it could be P EE or P ie first name maybe Geoffrey possibly on T Street I know what was that Lloyd Pierce okay hello hello is this mrs.

Donoghue I just want to talk to you that's all I have come a long way and it's very important why because mrs. Pierce I had a death in my family too my husband and his partner were killed were murdered by two men and I'm very sure that their death is somehow connected to your son's please please and when we got there they told us he was dead he didn't suffer they said the fault killed him instantly after the accident were you allowed to see your son no excuse me I'm on medication I have to take a bit mrs. Pierce mrs. Pierce I know you loved your son that's why we have to find out the truth Bobby he was at the construction site with the chief every the members said that Jeffrey fell in a hole but Bobby's equipped he didn't did he climb down but it was alright did you believe him yeah it's been a dozen wasn't there someone here that could verify what happened dr. Shaw well how well do you know this doctor oh he's been here since we moved here nine years in mrs. Pierce it was a tape that my husband had made the night that he was killed no I heard part of that tape it dealt with Landry and your son's death and the 10:45 t mean anything to you at all they were talking about something that's supposed to be happening in Landry tomorrow that has to do with Jeffrey's death and something that happened in Landry 20 years ago Landry wasn't even here 20 years ago well what was here hums just Fonz isn't there anybody somebody I could talk to that lived here 20 years ago it's Phillip Hager he's got a farm out in room 9 he's lived here all his life 83 miles about that accident right on it why are you watching me be been listed too long she was here she said she was going out to the Hager farm on route 9 that's about 20 miles but that was hours ago thank you I'm sorry to have bothered you um my sister's been trouble since her husband died she gets upset and says things that don't make any sense well I better get out there thanks again you showed up I've been waiting for you all day it doesn't more cows who died over by the pond that makes 40 head in two days come on I'll show him to you you that we are who you think we are let me handle this you ain't the vets from Lubbock know or not fooling who the hell are you just say no AirPort we'd just like to ask you some questions about what well about a lot of things but first of all about your cattle what's killing them ah damn do I know some kind of a sickness unlike any I ever seen here's all the old photographs I got I don't know what good that gun do you thank you you said that they showed this area before Crocker see I just came here right yeah but I already told you there weren't nothing here but farms mr. Hager can you come here a minute please as doing your in in these pictures here this one there's a valley and this one there isn't and they're both taken from exactly the same angle well no this one was taken before we sold the land to Philip Brockhurst no this one it was taken six seven years later after they filled it in to build on Landry is built on a landfill whatever you want to call it isn't that just another name for a garbage don't they truck the stuff in here for five years you know what they dumped garbage company buys land gets a dumping permit and then fills up the site then in many cases they sell the landfill to developers the problem is you see that years ago there were no laws or regulations to cover it so in many cases there's just no way of telling what was buried there and a lot of that stuff would be illegal waste today chemicals pesticides the residue from plastics papers drugs no one knows some companies are taking steps to correct things now but if that's what rockers hauled in here then landry is sitting on top of a time bomb that's probably getting ready to go off what are you talking about whatever was buried in landry isn't staying buried I was a chopper pilot and Nam the army had a spray of defoliant on the jungle facility enemy couldn't hide from us the only problem was you see it didn't just kill trees it also got people three ounces that stuff in the water supply will damn near wipe out a city these be tons of that stuff buried in this country the there was so much ten four five t that ten four five T that's what was on the tape wait wait wait what are you saying just that ten four five T they mentioned it on the tape I just didn't know what a minute what well just at ten four or five T on February 29th the company would be out of the woods and it would cover up with having twenty years ago didn't I tell you mr. Hager have people around here been getting sick with lung diseases birth defects liver problems that kind of thing I've been a lot of sickness here of late a couple of babies born bad just last month lousy bastards who brought Hurst and his friends what suppose they buried poisonous chemicals and Landry 20 years ago now they've discovered that those poisons are surfacing and they've got to cover it up so that they're not liable with 10 for 5 T it's gotta be the only question is how ah why couldn't they spray it like you didn't need any hand just fly over the city and spray it well they could make it look like an accident whatever it is it has to look like Brockhurst was not involved wait a minute what uh mr. Hager where's your phone right over there thank you yes ma'am in Bradbury the number of the loveth chemical company please thank you this is a closest place that would still have ten four five T dam switchboards closed I got a recording what there's a car coming up I thought it was a vet but he's turned his lights off halfway up the road are you gonna be all right yeah good luck okay thanks okay Now or Never let's go this way everything had reminded me forward for this town back east in the late forties and early fifties Tampa become the joke there and then so the land for a dollar and a contractor they weren't responsible now the place is a deathtrap lung disease miscarriages cancer you name it but they got one break but that well they found out about it now they're trying to correct it Landry may not be so lucky okay out there down and field there we're with the EPA Jews four or five t here maybe I can't do that look we should be there in a couple of minutes as soon as we say so we'll set down in Landry and start getting everyone out the plan must be to wreck the truck that was bred to 10:45 t over miles of country including Landry everybody don't get the highway binder but then the rest to get out it would just be a matter of how badly they were contaminated credit you get his attention - mechanical lock that there oh no we got problem stage get down there fast now can you use a CB radio alright again I try to get all the people and tell them to get people to have a microwave people on highway 14 anyone highway 40 evacuate the area get away far away as you can Randy. come in. let's go find that track (Dramatic Music) We've got to get out of here!
