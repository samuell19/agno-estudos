The color purple. It's both a cooled red... or a heated blue. Fragility and strength at the same time. It's the color of ambiguity... Of equilibrium. Its light, the purple light... an opportunity for making decisions. During the brief moment of the day, in which the sky turns purple... and the wind calms... the surface of the water turns into a sheet for this light to bounce off. Giving place to the ritual of the twelve stones. A ritual to resolve uncertainties. To decide between action or inaction. Twelve stones are gathered. The purple light hour is expected. With each stone, you give yourself a chance to doubt. Each stone... One doubt. Twelve stones... Twelve doubts. If after giving yourself twelve opportunities to doubt you didn't stop and threw the twelve stones, that action is already a decision. During the purple light, the stones fall into the water until one of these two things happen. You either end up with no stones from throwing them all, or, at one moment, a doubt stops you. Leaving you with a stone in your hand. You are early. Hi. How are you doing? MUNICIPAL POOL Do you remember Miguel? - No. - No? Yes! My younger brother. You've met him before. I guess I do. So he told me he started working on a play. - As an assistant. - Yes. So... They're auditioning to replace an actress. He wrote my name down without asking me. - Are you in the mood for it? - I think I am. He told me it goes this way. First... They do a personal interview. Then you need to prepare a scene. To finish, he says it'd be good If I had some kind of monologue ready. Something about brotherhood. A moral dilemma. - Was he supposed to tell you that? - I don't think so. It's next week. I'm trying to figure out what to do. And what did you think? I was thinking of using an incident that happened in C?rdoba. The audition has three parts. A form, a monologue, and a scene from the play. We'll fill the form together now. Then you go in. That's the moment of truth. We'll give you a couple of minutes so you can prepare two things: Prep your monologue about brotherhood. The one where you propose a moral dilemma, and the scene from the play. You got the second encounter between Isabella and Angelo. Yes. We recommend you to base the monologue on your life experience. They may ask a few more questions. - Any doubts? - No. I have everything prepared. Ok. Don't say that. The idea was for you to hear it just now. - Did you tell them? - No. I didn't. Do as if we don't know each other. - Should I lie then? - Yes. - So... Name? - Mariel. - Last name? - Y??ez. - Age? - 38. - Height? - 1,68. - Weight? - Not sure right now... - Occupation? - Actress and teacher. Miguel! You keep filling it. ID number and so on. - Sure. - I'll be right back. - Is everything all right? - No. I didn't know it was a lockdown. - Yes! I told you! - Oh! No... I left! I needed money. My brother was the only one who could help me. But I hadn't seen him in a long time so I couldn't go straight to him. I decided to take a detour. I learned he was in C?rdoba with a lover. A girl I knew from college. All thought I didn't know her that well, that was probably an easier way to get to him. If I tried to meet him upfront, he would avoid the encounter. That's why, I tried looking for her. I went downtown and saw her coming out of the pool. Same thing the following day. I guessed she'd be back the next day. So I went in and out of the pool area, until we met, randomly, at the gate. I spent like 15 minutes at it. Which one you like best? Our doubts betray us. Making us lose what we could gain for fear of taking risks. Our doubts are treacherous. Making us lose what we could gain for fear of risk. Doubt betrays. Making us lose what we could gain, for not risking. The second one. Our doubts are treacherous. Making us lose what we could gain for fear of risk. Yes. Good. Doubts... Are treacherous... Making us lose... - I'll open for you then. - Great. Thanks. Catalina! Hey! How are you? - How did it go? - I escaped. - What do you mean you escaped? - Yes. I didn't know how it was. I didn't like it. I left. Just like that? I guess they thought I was still in character. - How? - I don't know. The lockdown. Did you know they lock you down? To your left. More... More... - A bit more. - Ok. A little bit lower just in case. There... No. Just a bit up. There! - There? - Yes. Can you check it? Is it centered? It's crooked... That's the spot, but... - It's not bad. - Cool. Luciana! - Hey! How are you? - It's Mariel. Remember me? Sure! From college. Are you coming to the pool? Yes! No... No. Actually, I came to fetch some stuff. Oh! So, are you leaving? No. I don't have a ticket. Are you staying with friends? No. I'm waiting for my brother. He arrives today. My boyfriend also arrives today. You're dating? Sort of... Call him a lover. - Oh! And he arrives today? - Tonight. - What a coincidence! - Yes! Such a coincidence! - Ok. Should we move on? - Yes. Are you currently working on something? Yes. I wrote a play that will premiere this year. - Do you have a part there? - No. I don't. I wrote it and help with the set design. Do you have other jobs for this year? - In theater? - Yes. No. Do we have your reel? - Was I supposed to bring it? - Didn't you leave it last time? I never came before. This is my first audition. Do you like auditions? Yes... You can tell me the truth. The truth is I'm here because you signed me up without asking. - When are you due? - In a month and a half. - Do you know the play? - Yes. Do you have any siblings? - You know I do. - It's in the form. This is in it too. What would you be willing to do for them? I'd do a lot. Since I don't believe in God, I wouldn't do as Isabella. But I wouldn't go to bed with Angelo either. I think I'd realize earlier that the Duke is disguised as the monk. So I would force a quicker resolution. - Do you have a favorite scene? - Yes. The last one. The end where everything is fixed. - You're an optimist. - No. But I want this to end. - When will you have an answer? - Between today and tomorrow. - Are you ready? - Yes. So I'll leave you here for a while since you were supposed to prepare this here. Oh, and something else. The situation in there can turn hostile. I'm leaving soon to shoot a movie in Portugal, so I came to do some training. Since it's in an island it could get very physical. I'm training so I'm not out of breath when saying my lines. I came up with a strict plan. I go out hiking in the morning. Then have lunch at home. I go to the pool in the afternoon and run some errands. Then I come here to see if he comes. I feel today might be the day. - How long have you been seeing him? - Not much. A few months. - Oh... You know he has a kid? - Yes. Do you see him often? Not much. Once in a while. This will be sort of a farewell before Portugal. - Do you see him? - No. We don't get along very well. Why? I don't want to talk him down. But maybe he's a better lover than a brother. He's a great lover. So do you think things will remain as they are or that he'll leave everything for you? - You came digging for information? - Not at all. - I came to ask him for money. - Oh, really! Yes. I need a favor. - Are you working? - Not much. I babysit and write for a journal in Spain about generic stuff. - Are you doing any acting? - No. Did you see they're auditioning for "Measure for Measure"? Yes. But I had to come here. What do you mean you had to come? I was about to do it when the movie was confirmed. You have to do it. No, I always do bad in auditions. I can help. It's hard, but we'll do it together. You get a few paychecks and then tour for the rest of the year. I'm not sure. Maybe... I don't know. - You're up. - Coming. - Is it a problem if I leave this here? - No. I'll take care of it. You should have done the opposite. Stay and audition. I almost did. But there were a lot of people. It gave me phobia. Besides, if you find a job you'll be able to pay your brother back. But I always fail! It's like there's something inside of me that makes me fail. I understand you. But it's part of the deal. It's how things are. It's true. How about we plan a set of rehearsals while you're here? We pick a scene from "Measure for Measure". When I go hiking you stay home rehearsing. When I return we go over it together and you use it to audition. I don't know... - Do you want to act? - Yes! Then we call Buenos Aires and ask for a day off so you audition. But I need the money now. But it's better to ask for it with a plan in mind. - Don't you want to get the money from him? - Yes. - Don't you want to act? - Yes. That's it then. Stay at home tonight. I don't think he'll show up today. Twelve... Ha! Twelve... now... Stones... fall... into the water... Between... day... and... night... Between... who lives... and who... ha! No. Twelve steps... to your... back... Twelve... ghostly steps... I picked the first one to rehearse. I think that's the best one. Why? Because it's when Isabella introduces herself. She goes before the judge, as a novice, to ask for his brother to be spared. - The second is the one when she returns... - Yes. That's when the judge tells her he'll spare his life if she beds with him. - Yes. - The third is when she visits her brother. Claudio... Yes, Claudio. She tells him, outraged, how the judge asked her for her virginity in exchange for his life. Contrary to what Isabella thinks, her brother tells her - to please do it. - That she should sacrifice. - That one would apparently be the best. - Yes. But Isabella has few lines... I think the first one is the best. It has something about... Her role as a novice. Asking for something contrary to her beliefs... - It has good lines. - Yes. It's the one that represents her the most. Do you remember the lines? Not by heart, but I pretty much have it. Cool! Are we headed to your house? There's still one place left. - Have you done Shakespeare before? - Never. Isabella was going to be my first. But hey! It'll have to wait. How about you? A few. In college. I played Emilia in Otello. Ofelia in Hamlet. And I rehearsed Cordelia but we never premiered. I like Isabella though. If he arrives today it has to be at this time. He would have left Buenos Aires just before noon. He has to come through there. There's no other road in. What car does he have? He has a red car. I didn't picture my brother having a lover. I didn't picture you as his sister. - Have you been giving this a lot of thought? - Yes, a bit. Careful there... You okay? Come this way. - Morning! - Hi! Did you sleep well? I found the play. - I printed scene one for you. - Good! - I'll be back later and we'll see it together. - Thanks. Bye. You can stay in! No problem. ASCENT TO THE SKULL INDIAN CAVE - Hello Mariel! - Hello. Step to the center. Step in front of the mirror if you want. We hear you okay. Your brother is a forfeit of the law, and you but waste your words. Alas! Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once, and He that might the vantage best have took found out the remedy. O, think on that. How would you be, if He... Pick it up from the top! Alas! Alas... Why, all the souls that were-- That were-- Alas... Why, all the souls that-- All-- Alas! Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once, and He that might the vantage best have took found out the remedy. O, think on that. - How would you be, if He... - How would you be, if He, which is-- How would you be, if He, which is the top of judgment, should but judge you as you are? - O, think on that. - O, think on that. And mercy then will breathe within your lips, like man new made. I do think that you might pardon him. - And neither... - And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy. - I will not do't. - But can you, if you would? - Look, what I will not, that I cannot do. - But might you do't, and do the world no wrong, if so your heart were touch'd with that remorse as mine is to him? He's sentenced, 'tis too late. Too late? Why, no. I, that do speak a word. May call it back again. - Well, believe this-- - Stay put for that line. Well, believe this, no ceremony that to great ones 'longs, not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword, the marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe, become them with one half so good a grace as mercy does. If he had been as you and you as he, you would have slipt like him, but he, like you, would not have been so stern. - Again. - If he had been as you and you as he, You would have slipt like him, but he, like you, would not have been so stern. Pray you, be gone. - Do you have the green one there? - No. Not the green one. - Do you know where it is? - Maybe upstairs? Which ones do you have? I have a teal, a red one, and... I don't know. A violet or purple... I'm not sure. Ok. Give me the red one. Here you go. Ok. This is how it goes. You put your hand like this as you say the lines. And I'll give you three stones. This one is severe and arrogant. This one is ironic, and this one is light. I'll put one of the stones in your hand. You'll have to change the intention depending on it. - Ready? Let's start. - Yes. Too late? Why, no. I, that do speak a word. May call it back again. Well, believe this, No ceremony that to great ones 'longs, not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword, the marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe, become them with one half so good a grace as mercy does. If he had been as you and you as he, you would have slipt like him, but he, like you, would not have been so stern. Tomorrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him! Shall we serve heaven... with less respect than we do minister to our gross selves? Even for our kitchens we kill the fowl of season. Good, good my lord, bethink you. Who is it that hath died for this offence? There's many have committed it. At what time do you have the audition? In an hour. I'll be back soon. Ok, will continue this later. I came because I need a favor. I need money. Yes. Again. I ask you that, despite what you promised yourself, do the opposite. I don't know what it is, but... I'm out of luck. I can't succeed. I still don't have a job. Luciana is helping me out with all that. I know I have to insist. And I can only come to you. Put yourself in my place... And ask yourself if... If you wouldn't come to me asking for help... To solve a problem you can't solve on your own. I guess he won't be coming today. What if we call him and ask him? No. He asked me to never call him. Not even a text? No. Yeah... It's not cool. - Can I crash another night? - Yes, sure. Once I talk to him, I'll return to Buenos Aires. Yes. Besides, you'll have your audition. If he had been as you... and you as he, you would have slipt like him, but he, like you, would not have been so stern. If he had been as you, and you as he, you would have slipt like him, but he, like you, would not have been so stern. Good. Faster now. If he had been as you, and you as he, you would have slipt like him, but he, like you, would not have been so stern. If he had been as you, and you as he, you would have slipt like him, but he, like you, would not have been so stern. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS NATURAL PARK INTERDISCIPLINARY EXPERIMENTAL CENTER As much for my poor brother as myself: That is, were I under the terms of death, the impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies, and strip myself to death, as to a bed that longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield my body up to shame. Then must your brother die. And 'twere the cheaper way: Better it were a brother died at once, than that a sister, by redeeming him, should die for ever. Were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slander'd so? Free pardon... Ignomy in ransom... and free pardon, are of two houses: lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant, and rather proved the sliding of your brother a merriment than a vice. O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out, At times... To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean: I something do excuse the thing I hate, for his advantage that I dearly love. - We are all frail. - Yes. Else... let my brother die, if not a feodary, but only he owe and succeed thy weakness. Nay, women are frail too. Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves, which are as easy broke as they make forms. Women! Help Heaven! Men their creation mar in profiting by them. Plainly conceive, I love you. My brother did love Juliet, and you tell me that he shall die for it. He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love. I know your virtue hath a licence in't, which seems a little-- I know your virtue hath a licence in't, which seems a little fouler than it is, to pluck on others. Believe me, on mine honour, my words express my purpose. Ha! Little honour to be much believed, and most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming! I will proclaim thee, Angelo, look for't: Sign me a present pardon for my brother, or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud what man thou art. Who will believe thee, Isabel? My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life, my vouch against you, and my place i' the state, will so your accusation overweigh, that you shall stifle in your own report and smell of calumny. I have begun, and now I give my sensual race the rein: Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite, lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes, that banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will, or else he must not only die the death, but thy unkindness shall his death draw out to lingering sufferance. Answer me tomorrow, or, by the affection that now guides me most, I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you, say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true. Twelve stones are gathered. The purple light hour is expected. With each stone, you give yourself a chance to doubt. Should I put this here? -Stones on top of projection? -Yes, please. Let it show out? Go in. There, a bit further. -There? - That's good, and then the text starts. Ha! - Here? - No, a bit ahead. - Do you already have the stones? - No, we'll get them here. Hold on. I'll put him in the trolley. - Will this work? - Let me see. Yes, it's ok. Is that Luciana Farr?n? - Where? - There. I think she is! Should I call her? Lu! - Hey! - How are you? - Fine. Are you here for the audition? - Yes. I ran away. I don't know why I keep trying. As soon as you get in-- - I'd rather not know. - Ok... Were you not cast already? Yes. I had to turn it down and now they want me to audition again. They're so annoying... - I'll go see your play on Saturday. - Sure! Great. - Good luck! - See ya! - I haven't seen her for a long time. - Neither did I. - Is it that way? - No. It's the other way. - Luciana? - Hi! I came up with an idea for a play. - Are you in it? - No. I don't know. Maybe there's only stones in play. - Just that? - Yes. Just stones. Maybe there's also a voice. Twelve... Ha! Twelve... Now... Stones fall in the water... Between day... and... night... Between who lives... and who... ha! No... Twelve steps... To... your... back... Twelve... ghostly steps... to your... back... To your... side... You can see... twelve stones... Fall... in the water... now... Ha! Call... Call... ing... To... your... Gho... sts... The audition has three parts. A form, a monologue, and a scene from the play. We'll fill the form together now. Then you go in. That's the moment of truth. We'll give you a couple of minutes so you can prepare two things: A monologue about brotherhood. One where a moral dilemma is proposed, and the scene from the play. You got the second encounter between Isabella and Angelo. It's recommended you base the monologue on your life experience. - They may ask a few more questions later. - Okay. - Questions? - No. So take a moment to prepare this. I'll let you know when it's time. Ok. Thanks. And one day "Measure for Measure" premiered. With Luciana in the role of Isabella. The night I went to see the play I fell asleep during it and had a dream. I dreamt of Luciana, in Portugal, shooting a movie. And with her director. Dear Mariel, Here in the streets where we're shooting our movie with Luciana. The shoot is going well, except when it rains and we have to cancel the day. With every storm, I think of you. I try to remember why you couldn't come to shoot with us. If it keeps raining maybe you can take a plane here. What do you think? I wasn't able to answer because when Luciana looks at the camera, I was awakened by the applause. I felt sort of lost and somehow ridiculous in my seat, in that red theater, surrounded by people clapping. Still a bit sleepy, I thought twice about staying to say hello, telling Luciana about the dream and laughing about it, or if I should escape, go back home and keep sleeping. - Did you go see the play? - Yes. You didn't tell me. - Did you like it? - Yes. It's really neat. - How about her? - Good! She's a nice Isabella. Nice? - Seeing her had any effect on you? - No. Envy you mean? Hatred and resentment? I was just asking, was it the same as any other play? It was not the same. But seeing her perform I understood why they chose her over me. Is that good? - I achieved some clarity. - And no darkness? You're such a bummer! Nothing then... Yes! Hatred and resentment. I don't know. Maybe it sparked an itch for acting again. That is always there. Hi. Could I talk to Marta Urbini? Tell her it's Mariel Montenegro. I was calling about the auditions for "Measure for Measure". Oh! I thought there was one week left. Are you sure? Sorry to insist, but I'm not currently in Buenos Aires. Ok, everything is already in the car. Pipes, cables, plugs, I think we're done. Let's take advantage of the time. Come. Move this way! Smile! Brothers, get closer... There you go! Sure, I'll wait. Thanks. Oh! Ok. Bad luck. I thought there was still one week left. Sure. Next time. So tell me. I came to ask you a favor. - I need money. - Again? Yes. But it's the last time. I ask you that despite what you promised yourself, do the opposite. - It's not cool that you're here. - I know. But I thought if you saw me in a different context you'd understand me differently. Truth is I want to get organized but I have no luck. I know this doesn't make us better brothers, but it does help me get better. What is it now? Nothing comes out right. Nevertheless, I feel I need to insist. And the only way to do it is coming back to you. - You're still unemployed? - Yes. Luciana is helping me out with that. I don't want to cry or nag you any longer. I told her I'd speak to you as soon as you arrived and then I'd go back to Buenos Aires. I know I shouldn't ask you for a favor but I will anyway. Put yourself in my place. And... Ask yourself... If you wouldn't ask me for help to get out of a problem you can't get out on your own. - How was it? - Pretty peculiar, but I think it was fine. We'll have a decision soon. - Let me bring you your colors and open for you. - Thank you. If he had been as you and you as he, You would have slipt like him, but he, like you, wouldn't not have been so stern. Our doubts betray us, making us lose what we could gain for fear of taking risks. Our doubts betray us, making us lose what we could gain for fear of taking risks. - Hey! Mariel! How are you? - Luciana! How are you? - You look beautiful! - It's been so long! Yeah! Mariel! You ready? Yes! Coming. - So you're filling the form? - Yes. - Hadn't you got the part already? - Yes, but they want me to re-audition. - Want me to help? - Yes. Let's! Thanks. - We lost contact after C?rdoba. - Yes. I don't know what happened. - Are you working? - Not much really. - How did you do here? - Fine. It's pretty intense. - Yes, I heard so. - Oh, so they told you? Yes. I ran into a friend just before. - Ok. Do you want me to start? - Yes, go ahead. - Current occupation? - I'm about to shoot a movie. - The Portugal one. - Yes! Sure! That one. - They keep postponing it. - Role? In the movie or in the play? Don't know. Let's put both. In the movie I play Miranda. Here, Isabella. - Ok... Are you in any other play? - Yes. One. Did you bring a reel? Yes. They had one but I brought a newer one. - You already know the play... Do you have any brothers? - No. Are you sure there's no chance to get an audition? They told me they were finished. They probably cast someone already. - Who? - I don't know. But you would make a perfect Isabella. - Do you want me to call? - What for? I can speak to the director and get you an audition. I'll tell them you're going back to Buenos Aires especially for this. Forget it. They chose someone. Okay. You'll get it next time. Yes. - What time does your bus leave? - 10:30. - Your eyes are all red. - Really? How much? A bit. Did you have to cry a lot? - I didn't have to. I cried afterward, in the car. - Why? - I got a bit frustrated. - Again? Yes. I had a week to prepare it. I had an advantage in fact. Miguel had told me to write some sort of monologue, I rehearsed it, went in, I was happy going out. Two minutes after I see this actress preparing to get in. - And I knew they'd pick her. - Who is she? Luciana. You don't know her. She got the role last year but couldn't do it because she had a movie in Portugal. - So? - It'd be odd they wouldn't pick her if they did a year ago. You never know. Maybe you're more willing and that shows. When will you hear back from them? I told Miguel to come as soon as he's done. - To see the effects. - Yes. You'll know when he arrives. I'm not sure she has more chances than you. Why is she auditioning if they already know her? She said something similar. But I guess it was just pity talk. - Did you talk to her? - Yes. I don't think she realized how I was. But I saw her and had the impulse to talk to her. - And then you cried. - Yes. I cried then. We thought we'd seen you but weren't sure it was you. How are you? What are you doing here? - Taking a walk. You? - Going to college. - Are you coming from the river? - Yes. - I didn't know this place. - Neither did I. - She told me about it. It's nice. - Yes. It's calm. Police can't enter. People come to read, take a nap, - to fish. I came every year. - I came yesterday for the first time. - I returned today because I forgot a book. - Did you find it? Yes. It was right where I left it. - Who's in there? - Tom. Taking a nap. - When was he born? - March the 7th. - Are you teaching? - No! I'm studying. Math. - Really? I didn't know. - Yes! We've had a teacher's strike for several days now, anyway. Actually, there's a protest at 7. Maybe you'd like to come. Sure. I have to go to the river first. - This river? - Yes. It'll only take 5 minutes. It's tasty! Here. Enough? Want some more? Yummy. Bye! I have to go. I'll be back in about three hours. Call me if you need. Luciana is texting me. She asks how much longer. Tell her 40 or 45 minutes. One hour. Tell her one hour. When did Luciana Farr?n started managing a theater? She started a few months ago, she told me. There's not much she can do yet. - It's cool that she called you. - Are you friends with her? Not really. But we get along. Did she stopped acting after "Measure for Measure"? Yes. I think she did. - Do you think it'd work for us? - I think it may be big. But we'll see. The problem is the stage, but I think we could adapt it. Maybe we need new panels and extra light. You use microphones? Yes. I don't think that's going to be an issue. In fact, for the ritual and the purple the seats work better. - Hey! It' so good you could make it. - Yes. Sorry we got delayed. - No worries. We have time. - It's so good you thought of us. Yes! I thought you probably had a project so I told Miguel. Come. This way. - When was the last time we saw each other? - A year ago? - We met by the river last time. - You're right! It's such a pity we didn't see each other again. Yes! I spent the past times pretty secluded. - I saw you anyway. - When? Before giving birth, I went to see "Measure for Measure". - Really? I never saw you. - Yes, the thing is... In the middle of the play I got really sleepy and dozed off. It was not your fault or the play's. After that, I was ashamed to greet you. - I loved your work. You were great. - At least the part you got to see! - I liked it. - I was having a bad time. - Really. I couldn't tell. - I quit the play in fact. I'm not acting anymore. At least for a while. What happened? Sol! Come, it's this way... I'm not sure. Maybe repeating it every night... There's something on Isabella's lines that started getting to my nerves. - The play is pretty dark. - Totally. But maybe that darkness is what made me feel that acting is not for me. - Now they'll call you. - I wouldn't mind that. Bye! This is where I sat when I came to see "Measure for Measure". You were good! Okay. Not the king's crown... nor the deputed sword, the marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe, become them with one half so good a grace as mercy does. If he had been as you and you as he, you would have slipt like him, but he, like you, would not have been so stern. If he had been as you and you as he, you would have slipt like him, but he, like you, would not have been so stern. If he had been as you and you as he, you would have slipt like him, but he, like you, would not have been so stern. If he had been as you and you as he, you would have slipt like him, but he, like you, would not have been so stern. - If he had been as you... - And you as he, you would have slipt like him, - but he, like you, would not have been so stern. - One more! If he had been as you and he as he-- From the top! If he had been as you and you as he, you would have slipt like him, but he, like you, would not have been so stern. You mean me? Yes. It's looking good. Pull it higher. Higher. There you go. - Is that good? - Yes. - Yes. - The ritual would be here? Yes. Thanks. - You didn't get to see our play, right? - No, I missed it. - Miguel, come. - Should I take this there? No. Let's go with this. - Come through here so I can show you where we would put... - There. Stop, stop. Tape it around here. - There it is! - Great. Three... Four, five... Seven, eight... nine. Ten... Eleven... Twelve... - How's it going? - Great! - You don't have a part in the play? - No. Are you still studying? Yes. Math. And I work here. It's not bad. - You don't miss acting? - No. I hesitate. I really don't know. Sol once told me that people who succeed at acting never hesitate when looked up close. It's not my case. It's really odd that they have to call you to act - and you're not totally convinced-- - Let's see. - You didn't hesitate. - Neither did you. The ritual! The color purple... - Mariel? - Yes. -Come. - It's both a cooled red or a heated blue. - There? Fragility and strength at the same time. - Here's the stone. - It's the color of ambiguity... - Should I go through here? - Yeah, I'll drop you off there. Of equilibrium... Its light, the purple light... an opportunity for making decisions. Now, Sol, action. Ritual. Big purple light. During the brief moment of the day in which the sky turns purple... Stone and the ritual. and the wind calms... the surface of the water turns into a sheet... Set the stone lower. - There! - Twelve steps... to your back. With each stone, you give yourself a chance to doubt. - Twelve steps... ghostly steps. - Mariel, the stone. Each stone, one doubt. When it's really dark you can't see anything, right? Twelve stones... Yeah, it looks good, it looks good like that. It's with twelve stones. With each stone you allow yourself to doubt. About a decision or an action. Each stone is a doubt. If a doubt doesn't stop you... You throw another stone. And so on. Two, three, four... So two things can happen. One option, is that you stay with a stone in your hand. That means your doubt is important. It means you don't have to carry on with that action. Second option is that you're left with no stones. So... The only thing left for that decision is to get executed. That's what you were doing the last time we met? Yes. That day I threw all my stones and decided to quit acting. You can always go back to the river, pick twelve new stones, throw them... And act again. Hello. Here's the stone. How's it going? Higher. There. Hello! - Hey. - How are you? - All good? - Yeah. You? All good. - We'll start in no time. - Great. - Hey! How are you? - Fine. - You? - Fine. - It's almost ready. - It looks great! - Do you like it? - Yes! - Were you there all the time? - Yes. - How many auditioned? - Erm... Seven. You, Brenda, Luciana, Catalina, Mara, Andrea and Rosario. How did Luciana do? I don't know. I was outside with the forms. I'm sure you all discussed after. Didn't you hear anything? They haven't decided yet. What did they say about me? - They haven't decided. - C'mon! You can tell me. - Tell you what? - That they didn't pick me. They picked Luciana. She is so good. I'm sorry. It wouldn't have been bad. For me to do a play after Tom was born. No. But let it go now. It's over. - Who was behind the mirror? - The director and Angelo. - Are you done here? - No. Almost. Will you do a whole run? We just wanted to try the lighting effects to check if the stones disappeared. If you want I can tell you when we do a full rehearsal. Are you ok? Yes. Let's see. Go. - Where? - There. Now. - What for? - To see. - To see what? - To see if you want to act. Go on. Here? Mariel?
