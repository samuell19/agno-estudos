There is a phrase ascribed to St Augustin and Stalin: "In a besieged citadel, all dissidence is treason". Thus my counter-argument: (Chile 1941) "To survive, institutions must behave as besieged citadels". (Political exile) Pierre Klossowski's autobiographical novel (Film Director) "The Suspended Vocation" tells a story I knew in Chile: The dispute of Jesuits and followers of the Virgin, against zealots of Church hierarchy and "Matriarchy". Disputes are expected to be between Ancients and Modems. Not between co-existing tendencies. Yet this is the most common. Disputes form a circular logic reinforcing the institution in which the dispute takes place. The relation between a dispute and the institution it occurs in shows the institution's perfection. Its digestive, chemical aspect. Yet every analysis of it instead suggests a device which functions mechanically. Like a machine. When freedom assumes this form of a pretended dispute in relation to a dogma not necessarily formulated, I am intrigued, because I see a likeness in such different sides: the Church and a political party. This must be so in any kind of institutionalisation. Entitled "The Suspended Vocation", a film aiming to promote the priestly vocation was begun in February 1962. (1942). As dissident elements hijacked it (As the film was unfinished) for their ideas, (after years in a lab,) the monks began another film: (it was restarted by professionals) same title, opposite theses. (with more money). Aware of the confusion (Aware of the difficulties) provoked by films of the same title, (of editing the first film,) the Provincial of E ordered (the director tried) only one film. (filming it all again.) This film takes everything positive (This film recreates the first) of the previous two. (with the footage of the second). "In a besieged citadel, all dissidence is treason". Indeed, in Sils-Maria, when I mention Christ's face and the sick one's, I... The sick one? I see a link between Christ's face and the image. Not an equivalence. Not a pure and simple equivalence between Nietzsche, I mean between Christ... The excessive virility must be eradicated. What I call 'excessive virility', is, I believe, responsible for our civilisation. These damned virile values uproot the classes. Domination means industry. Industry means the proletariat. The proletariat means destabilisation, vandalism of the countryside, families ruined, misery, revolution. Whoever wants the mob to revolt must want relentless oppression. The excessive virility unleashed on the world threatens the Church's spiritual matriarchy, as the Dragon hunts the Lady in Revelation. Excessive virility finds in means of production and in the social unrest it causes, its own vicious circle. Social calvary is its latest invention. Torture chambers are the last evil of the 'virile values'. It is the relationship between suspect and traitor. Between executioner and victim. The very secret of sodomy. Father, why do you smile? I noticed that you smiled while I spoke. Why, my son? I follow what you say, your gestures. You say you were following my argument, so why were you smiling? Follow me. Is he asleep? He tried the other zone, to Rambouillet. - Not easy. - He's experienced. - The letter. - He's been interned once. He ran away. And paradoxically, it's him that the Black Party is protecting. Rambouillet... - Why take the longest route? - Why not? What is the longest route? Maybe you don't have to cross their zone. You can cross the non occupied zone the Devotion left. The Devotion did not cede it. It was invaded by force. Exactly. The Devotion maintains two convents in the zone. Doubtless. Over there the inquisition's agents are everywhere. It might be better to go through Rambouillet. Exactly. Where it thinks it's dominant, the Black Party hardly protects itself. Do you have a pencil? Look! Look. The Black Party is everywhere. Binding me closely to my rival simply because he maybe raped my mistress. Only because of the rape. Partly for the brutality of an act I am incapable of, attracted only by that. And with him I would have found the face of what is impossible for me. Also, perhaps especially, for the betrayal, which would have attracted me. So, with the rape of women I've loved, perhaps I found a complement to my tendency to betrayal. I had lived with her for several months. One night, by certain hints, I persuaded a new friend to visit us. - We were delayed. - Sorry. This is Jean-Pierre Vincent. Carole, my wife. In this way I felt betrayed and replaced. And so felt I had the curious gift of mediator. It's nice here. Very nice. We're here since before the war. No, that's not sure. Any liberalism engenders disorder, revolt. Do you think so? Alcohol was quick to take effect. Certain anecdotes, inductive to the situation I was seeking, prepared the way. That temptation to do evil and the inability to do it... It was her who took the initiative. Their complicit glances didn't escape me. Nor the feeble resistance he made to sharing the night with us. MOI”: however, it seems evident that in the sacraments, not only the necessity of sharing, but of imparting them to others, replace in me the need to do evil. Here it is. Whoever stole it, knows I'm not implicated. Your friend made it into the zone. He's safe now. You are the one in danger. He was intercepted. When? We don't know. Three days we haven't heard from him. Did he get to Rambouillet? We don't know. I don't know anything. They didn't get the letter. So you're out of danger. Read this. No. It's not yours. But it concerns someone you know well. Yes? I'll tell him. Goodbye. I'll call you, Father. Good. Now to us. - Do you recognise the letter? - Yes. You've known La Montague, for long? I know him, but not intimately. It would not occur to me to mention intimacy. The Devotion's ideas don't interest me. I want this internal war, this civil war, to stop. Jérôme, listen to what you're saying. "Internal war", "civil war". "Civil"? Forget it. Give me the letter. "The Heavenly City we strive for "exists not as a utopian dream but in reality, "Physically. "Not only near God in masculine form "as Christ, "but also in a form both male and female". The Devotion's ideas don't attract me. It would never occur to me to mention attraction. Father, if civil war drags down the Church, I see the mark of the abominable distinction... Let us forget this. ...between the orders of the world and grace. We were just commenting on your strange interpretation of the Father Confessor's words. The virile order? Yes. He sees it as the origin of our civilisation. And? He called it excessive virility, domination. Domination means industry, industry means the proletariat. And with it revolution and repression. Thus, with the resulting social unrest, virility finds its vicious circle. Did the Father really say 'vicious circle'? The vicious circle. The virile values end in the link of the executioner to the victim, the secret of sodomy. Those are your words! It's not true. You felt you were chosen. Hoping to fight evil from the church ramparts, a besieged citadel. But you don't take part in the attacks, or wait silently and obediently for the assault. Instead, you are seduced by internal rumours that agree with your state of constant revolt. Diverted from the real fight, giving yourself up to disputes that never tear apart the Holy City. With the intensity of a restless heart! Leave. Traitor. The Devotion will be grateful. His silence was precious. You'll have to change convents to another zone. You'll find the superiors more understanding there. I'm sure the Superior himself will be delighted. My Brother... Yes, it's all a bit temporary. So it's not strange that the number of guests is falling. In any case, the tacit house-rule demands constantly changing their cells and renewing the furniture. It keeps the guest brothers busy. It keeps them away from ancient disputes. The rule also forces them to fix or make tools and furniture for convents in other zones. So the significance of ancient disputes is regularly submitted to others. Finally, the distribution of tasks, and the desire to perform the hardest and most painful, became a tacit rule. The house accepts it in its significance indicating a dual mission: spiritual and economic. Father Superior, I see in the brothers' total submission to tacit rules and exhausting tasks which have economic aims, a class struggle within the Church. I know I can trust you. Among the brothers here, there are, how could there not be, members of the Devotion. Just as there are others of indefinable origin, secular, sent by the Inquisition to re-educate their souls. And others, like you, without whom my mission would be impossible. Thank you Father Superior. Father! What do you want? A scandal? Absolutely not! Son of a bitch! Shame! The doctors at the Virgin's feet! St Bernard and St Thomas. Precisely those who fought the doctrine of Immaculate Conception! It's hard to tell who they really are. They could even be unbelievers. - I'm happy. - How are you? I'm happy too. - Been here long? - A few days, and you? Just arrived. Come here. - Is it hard? -Yes, it's hard, very hard. You know, one does penance here. They give us 8 hours of work a day, and we do more: 14, 15... Will you stay here long? I don't know. And you? I don't know. I can escape when I want. They'll catch me, bring me back here. It's better that way. Be careful, they think you're a double agent. The Virgin's hymn. It's forbidden. The tacit rule. The tacit house-rule requires that in every commandment held by good Christians there is an excess, a surpassing of perfection. Sometimes contradictory. As the surpassing of moderation is. Of course I speak of 'surpassing'. Not of 'overflowing'. This 'surpassing complements what other convents call the law of stability: not being able to leave the convent. Which here transforms itself into an obligation to leave the convent. Inversion! What, Jacques? I didn't say anything, Father. Inversion! You think the lack of composition, of unity, won't affect the fresco's quality. People are prejudiced. Full of preconceived ideas. Unity of style you say. But how can unity of style exist without uniformity of opinion? And so it is. Art must show diverse ways of treating the same mystery. Lack of composition? I'd go further. I would say a total lack of artistic quality. Is its loss important? If it aids a new approach to the mystery by hundreds of brothers' anonymous expression? In which everyone does his bit? Retouching details, suggesting changes. No unity, no artistic quality, yes! I would even say it's good that way. If I understand, you want us all to participate in this fresco. Even if we haven't the means. You should not be afraid of overcoming your prejudices. Of sweeping them away. It is not the making that matters. But the embodiment of mystery. It matters that everyone brings their own doubts. Then the collective work shows its thirst for unity. That is how the fresco matters. That is where grace reveals itself. In the impulse towards a collective experience of the mystery. So, for you, grace is no more than undertaking collective tasks? I let my tongue run away with me. Father Superior, I would not accuse you of loyalty to your enthusiasm. Don't be afraid of your judgement's severity. Tonight, in the Chapter House, you'll say what you have to. Get up Father Superior. Father! Get up! Please. Get up! You could be crucial to the solution of this dispute. One has to know that the fresco can't help us at all in this mission. How could a contradictory image of mystery help? The mystery is obscure. But its expression must be clear, concise and well done. Obtaining a correct expression, the fresco shows Christ's message of salvation. It expresses joy by its beautiful images, easy to understand. The Church must be present in such a fresco, shown by the pope and its bishops. It must be painted by a master of the art of reproducing nature on paper and in paint. What do you think of me, Brother? I hardly know you. What should I think of you? Brother Jérôme, what do you think of me, prostrate before you? Ostentation. Brother, I humbly ask you whether the extreme humility I exhibit doesn't demand criticism of the ostentation I so humbly display? Indulgence in ostentation, Brother. Brother, exhibiting such indulgence, making reverences before you, before someone like you, isn't it that I want to be unmasked? Search for complicity. Isn't it true that in searching for complicity with you I betray myself to those I fear? Suspicion. Ostentation. Indulgence. Complicity. Suspicion. The Father insisted we paint the Doctor of the Church's real face. Even if he himself noticed the irreverence of it. Two of the Church's greatest theologians turning their backs on the Virgin's triumph. What will you put here? First of all, the Pope. Pius IX, who promulgated the doctrine. That image... Pius IX, doubtless. That image... The sister who gave her life for the dogma's promulgation. Come here. Showing the Virgin twice is a determined fault of composition, aside from hieratic aspects. You see, the one you wanted to paint, whom you should paint now a third time, is the Lady who cries. Mélanie and Maximin would finish it harmoniously. Get out! Agitator! "Christ was crucified head-up and St Peter head-down. "Shouldn't the law from below invert the heavenly reign?" We were just criticising the Inquisitor of the Virgin of Chaste Marriage. What do you think of the fresco? Terrifying. Didn't you say it would be perfect to include the Lady who cries? For reasons of equilibrium. Equilibrium? You mean of the souls of this house? Aesthetic equilibrium. You heard, Monsignor. We will leave you to speak with the Abbé. Excellent, my son. While I was studying, the seminarist, who was tested by the fresco in this holy house, had a much harder life. At that time, the fresco had no symbols to decipher, resolved by referring to personal memories of a secular kind. It is not good, my son. It isn't good for you to stay here. Do you have a protector? No, your excellency. Well, my child, I will adopt you. And take you to my diocese tomorrow. There you will study far from these disputes. Before pursuing the Church's enemies, fight them within yourself, so as to better serve the Lord. Do you believe in one God, Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth? I do. Do you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, only son of God, born of the Father before time began? He is God born of God. Light born of Light. True God born of the true God. Born not created. The same substance as the Father, by whom everything was made. For us men, and for our salvation, He descended from heaven. By the Holy Spirit and Mary, took flesh. He became man. Crucified for us by Pontius Pilate, He suffered His passion, and was buried. On the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven, to the Father's right hand. He will come again to judge the quick and the dead. And His reign will have no end. Do you believe in the Holy Spirit that gives life? With the Father and the Son He receives the same adoration, the same glory. He spoke by the prophets. Do you believe in the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church? Of course. In one baptism for the forgiveness of sins? Long live the Bishop! In the resurrection of the dead and life in the world to come? Yes, yes, yes. Amen. Here he is, Mother Angélique. Intact. So I see. Mother Angelique leads an order of Tertian Sisters. We have friends in common. La Montague, for example. They speak well of you. I'm very happy. Ah, those little brothers! They're so excited. They won't shift. Do you think that we'll enter before midday? The other zone? Yes. Out of the way! You will stay with the sisters, then go to a presbytery. Come in. I'll be with you in a moment. Take a seat. You recognised her. I know this face. Of course you do. It's her. Yes, that's her. MB... Ii... an.“ da... Why Malagrida? Who is Malagrida? An impostor. Malagrida has performed important services for our community. He painted this version of the fresco. Mélanie and Maximin. The Lady who cries. Enough that I mention her, to be considered an inquisitor, a Black Party agitator. While they think I'm a double agent. But you accepted La Montagne's proposition. To write a secret report about the Black Party. Even you have read La Montagne's letter. And of course my answer written on the back. Answer... "I accept - it's in the collective if not individual interest." But even in accepting, you left open other options. Don't doubt that La Montague probably circulated that letter. So that it would come to your superiors. Why? To neutralise you, to discredit the secret of your report. Thus obtaining precious information, considered useless by all, because apparently not secret. Who is La Montague? Who is Malagrida? Malagrida. A Spanish painter well known in avant-garde circles. He brought the photo of a Carmelite exhumed during the violation of the monasteries. In which he apparently took part. My friend during those years of subversion. A charlatan. The Devotion believes a child converted its founder. .Even adopting him. He's an orphan raised by his aunt. He's full of kindness. He ends by commenting on Christ's message: "I came to divide man and his father, "woman and her mother, etc. "This cry of elation "increases the recipients of love "once the family is denied. "Christ's image isolated from His traditional, Judaic context, "historically debatable as it is, "has an authentic aspect even for an orthodox opinion. "As it is on those words that the structure of the Church "and monasteries is built". Yes, of course, page 60. "On those words that the structure of the Church "and monasteries is built". Yes. Of course. Come quickly! Just a moment. Wait! Not like that! Gently. Two children... It was... Mélanie, Maximin. The Lady who cries. She says that her Son will punish the world. What can I do for you? Haven't you been told about the statues? The statues? I'm very confused. It isn't easy to explain. Your young secretary ordered a number of statues from us. And the price has not been fixed. Come here! Is this my so called young secretary? Indeed it is, sir. This person informs me you ordered a number of statues. Yes sir, to decorate my room. May I point out that given the size of the order, I can offer a discount. How much are they? Impossible. This is wrong. Excuse me, this is a mistake. Here's the exact amount. I'm sorry. I don't understand... The sum is even more. More? It must be another mistake. Please, follow me. It's hard to imagine that that poor child could undertake all this alone. With the sole aim of robbery. Look! There's a figure missing. Who is she? Who is she? Who is she? Enough! impostor! The Lady who cries! Mélanie! Maximin! Is it Her? So it was true! They really do exist. They really do exist. They really do... Since his conversion, La Montagne betrays a particular zeal for popular devotion. His creative talent gave cohesion to the dispersed expressions of the Marian cult. Malagrida met La Montagne, who couldn't resist drawing him to the Christian truth. Malagrida doubtless told him stories of the Spanish Civil War. La Montagne took Malagrida to la Salette. He took as conversion what was nothing more than curiosity and humour. Our rooms face each other. Those 'priestlets' are determined we meet. Come up. I've got a good cognac. I saw the fresco. My ideas about how to represent the Immaculate Conception weren't appreciated by your friends. Sit down. I saw you showed the dying Carmelite in great detail. Fantastico! You recognised her! I knew it. Of course. It's a photo of the nun mutilated during the civil war. What are you talking about! It's a fake. What do you mean? It's a fake, a reconstruction. Please, take your place. You knew the secretary of Carpocrates? You know she did this kind of thing. Lean that way a bit please. That's it. Perfect. Sister Théophile. It's her. She's in this convent. In this convent? She's a tease. She put me down in front of Sister Vincent. Sister Vincent... Do you know her? You're to help me find her love again. You and Mother Angélique. Mother Angélique, what an extraordinary woman! If it was all up to her, it would end well. I need you to help me. I'm tired of hiding among these virgins. Only to catch the occasional glimpse of that poor girl... La Montague, I'm sure you know: my relation to his cousin angered him. And Mother Angélique put you here so that you would help me. We must be very careful. You can't seduce La Montagne's cousin just like that. Aren't you meant to be Spanish? Why the dreams in particular? Well, the dreams... the dreams somehow... guarantee the unity of one phenomenon. We're awake when we sleep. We sleep when we're awake. And then, sleep takes over and, by will or by force, we give up! Those who believe the Church, what to say to them? I strengthen their faith! I strengthen it. If they have wavered in their faith, although that is what allows them to bloom and fight against sleep, to fight against sleep and stay awake... In that case I leave their faith intact. But... If these souls are unbalanced by their faith, by their very faith, I give them their mysteries, and all that they include. How do you know if a vocation is authentic? Since there is no voice strong enough up there for one believing he hears it to feel obliged to obey? You believe the call to be an illusion? I am not disputing the reality of the phenomenon. Nor its expression in a world built by man as a result of that phenomenon. That is not the issue. I simply attribute another origin to it. And I find that origin in the powers which inhabit the infinite and indomitable space that is the human psyche! You want to destroy the Church and its teachings. Only the Church can make mankind accept death. How many unbelievers accept death? The Church must, and only she can, teach that there is no hope beyond the grave. Today everyone believes what they say, says what they believe. But... The secret is in the institution. The institution. The phenomenon of the Church which eludes men and leads them to where they ought to be. Nothing prevails against her! What does the diocese think of your... 'therapeutic? activity? Everything must happen according to the Church's intentions. You mean that the Church, our holy mother, the Church is only an image...? The Church won't say what she is. But she knows that I know! Cell 43 The red one, Sister Théophile. Sister Vincent... the pink one. Yes, Mother Angélique. You won't be lost in the eyes of Our Lord for this. Thank you for your confidence, Reverend Mother. I am aware of this mission's insignificance. You are incorrigible! Come in. He's arrived. Now we've got him! Sit down. I'm glad you understood. Champagne? The bird is in the cage, my friend! He's trying to provoke you. Music! Please leave. No! My mission is to stay. Don't worry about me. You're the one in danger. Just pretend everything is normal. Kiss me. The girls are shy. Wait for the champagne's effect. Drink! Don't let your feelings show. In any case they'd be unjust. Since, how can you know how this will all end? Don't be afraid. I wanted you to come. Kiss me. Don't look at him. Nothing escapes him. Let us be happy that everything is done as our superiors wanted it. That's the best for us. And you? I am happy to serve where I am called. You're expected. - The Abbé Jérôme? - Yes. Tell him I am coming. Say nothing, I am informed. When I think that your pretence could have made me take unfair decisions. I know all about your intrigues. We know you, Abbé Jérôme. You are known. You are spoken of. But why are you following Sister Théophile? Reverend Mother should do as she likes with her girls. If you want to know, the Reverend Mother accuses you of helping this impostor with my niece. You, a future priest... What are you waiting for to bum your habits? Yes? Yes, speaking. Thank you. I've already been informed. No. On the contrary. He himself. Thank you. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I got carried away. But, why exactly were you following sister Théophile? I didn't understand her going out alone. Even less that she went to Malagrida's studio. Does that shock you so much, Abbé? Don't let this bother you any more. By accusing you to La Montague, the Reverend Mother gives one lie for another. I don't understand. You do understand, my son. You know this whole intrigue was arranged by Mother Angélique and Malagrida. Isn't that what you came to tell me? Yes, Father. Mother Angelique telephoned me a moment ago. She didn't lack arguments. I can't understand Mother Angélique's attitude towards Sister... You do understand it. .Sister Théophile - subjected to certain humiliations. - Indeed. She evidently wants to excite passions in Sister Théophile. All this for experimental reasons. So she can see the interest Sister Théophile has for you. Evidently, she is trying to reverse things by means of certain... counter-penitences. I must speak to you. I have to take this picture immediately. To Malagrida? I have to go. Listen. We have to meet. Even if only for a moment. Mother Angélique told me of your intentions. She'll tell you of mine. I have to speak to you. Not now. - When? - Not now. Malagrida's latest work! Go home. Mother Angélique is waiting. I searched for you. I need to speak to you. My office is not safe. Come here. It isn't true that I telephoned your superior. It was made up by him and others... La Montague, for example. Jealous of my supposed influence over you. Trying anything to regain your trust. Your superior has motives I prefer not to mention. You shouldn't leave as you'd planned. By no means. It's even more important now that you stay here. Have you done the test of the fresco? You knew the shameful presence of certain people here. The hateful distinction. You must write it all down. You must help me denounce this situation. You and I, anonymously, should publish a pamphlet explaining this fresco. You explain your ideas of the poisonous abundance of faith. I'll try to expound on my ideas about the need of marriage for priests. Marriage? We could print it by hand. Using emblematic pictures. Go. I'll tell you when and how we can meet. Go. They are waiting for you. I am so happy to see you finally, Abbé. I was just thinking about our last meeting. And I believe that something remained unclear between us. This business of the Abbé, as you put it, of the 'euthanasian' Abbé. Do you maintain that Mr Persienne played a negative role? Totally incomprehensible. I mean, his presence here in the Church is a mystery to me. Even admitting the existence of two orders, an atheist Abbé examining from a scientific stand... Please, carry on. The Abbe has been here for a while. Don't say you hadn't seen him? You were saying... According to the distinction... Yes, indeed. According to the distinction... The damned distinction. The distinction between the temporal order and that of grace makes comprehensible, and so possible, the activity of a worldly Therapeutic Father. I'm glad to hear you say so. You understand that Father Persienne speaks about a nature not yet touched by grace. Whom the Church above all else teaches how to die. It teaches that man is destined by grace to live. By death of the cross. Be careful. Wait another two or three years and you'll have your tum to do good. Be firm in your discipline. That's all. Either grace has uprooted pride and left humility in such a soul. Or the soul rejoices in a pretence Mr Persienne recognises well, since he perhaps has been its victim. Because the Church has chosen, she can divide atheist priest from therapist in the person of Mr Persienne. So well that you mix them up, influenced by your own demon. Everyone is descending on you today. I have a message for you. There is a project I'm sure will interest you. The community no longer hides its interest in the report you are writing about us. A report, I believe, for La Montague. We consider the report to be necessary. And we would like to help you finish it. I'm afraid I don't know you. But the community knows you. It appreciates you. I don't want to get involved with the Black Party. The community turns a blind eye to that legend. It only wants to help clarify what should be clarified. Come. There is a project of writing a monograph. In it certain opinions will be discussed concerning the two orders and the Immaculate... Who told you about this monograph? Certain propositions were made to us. The community is pleased about this. Happy that differences are discussed within the Church. That monograph does not exist. Come with me. We might find we have interests in common. They represent the Black Party. I have nothing to do here. Be patient. I was just saying, as far as I'm concerned, the person who contacted me for this ecumenical task was Mother Angélique. It is rather surprising that we were all contacted by the same person. Here's the Devotion's representative. Mass for Mother Angélique tomorrow at 7 It's dreadful. And this mass? What? You didn't know anything? Not here. Come. Our superiors have secularised our community. Take up God's protection. So that on a bad day you can resist and fight to the bitter end. Hold firm. With Truth as your belt. Dressed in the breast-plate of Justice. Feet clad in ardour for the Evangelist of Peace. Always wearing the shield of Faith, thanks to which you can extinguish the flames of Evil. Take the helmet of Salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. Can it really be him? He who will pronounce the words of the consecration? He who will hold the Body of Christ and place the essence of the Lord on the tongue? Don Malagrida, Inquisitor of the faith... Our battle is not against flesh and blood. But against the spiritual presence of evil in holy places. Usurper of Christ! You'll never get me! I am leaving Rome. You have failed. I cannot hold you back. Go to God by the path that seems right. You don't know yourself as one should know. And since you need to know yourself, you will return. Subtitles by Miriam Heard
