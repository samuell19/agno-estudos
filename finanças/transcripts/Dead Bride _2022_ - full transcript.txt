(slow piano music continues) Seth seems to have settled in already. It's only a temporary situation. If it's difficult for you to live here, we could- Put it on the market, I know. Exactly. (Richard laughs) (slow orchestral music) (Alyson moans) Hey. It's nothing, relax. (Alyson trembles) Breathe, relax and breathe. Relax and breathe. That's right, relax and breathe. You need to breathe, to take a deep breath. It'll help you. I'm scared. There's no need to be, it's only a bad dream. We all have dreams, I dream, Mommy dreams. And do you have bad dreams, too? Sometimes, but then I wake up and it all disappears, and you've always got Mr. Bear with you. Come on, try to get some sleep. [Alyson] No. You want me to leave it on? Okay, we'll leave it. Good night. (slow ominous music) (Alyson trembles) (Alyson moans) (coffee maker whines) [Reporter] Kena Saunders, the girl who disappeared three years ago, has been found at the bottom of a lake, thanks to the intervention of the psychic, David Owen. According to reports, on the morning of September 10th, Mr. Owen led a group of scuba divers to the lake shore, telling them, "She's here." A robot with a camera was then submerged, and at the bottom of the- May I? - Thanks. - At the depth of over 100 meters, her car was found. The license plate matched, leaving no doubt. The question that must now be asked is, how did Mr. Owen find her? Here's what the- There you go, you'll be late. Not if I take this with me. I'll be home late tonight, we have a work dinner, so- Have a nice day. Okay. (laughs) [Reporter] Who was pleasantly impressed by the man's abilities, so seer or charlatan? (slow piano music) (vacuum roars) (slow piano music continues) (Alyson sighs) (water trickles) (slow ominous music) (slow ominous music continues) (Seth cries) Hey, sweetie, Mommy's here. Don't cry, shh, shh, shh. (slow ominous music continues) You can't play in here, especially with Mommy's stuff, and I'll need that ball of yarn. (slow ominous music) Bye, darling. Well, it's not that different. [Alyson] Oh, really? Sure, for me, it's just a change of location. Uh, what about your old clients? They're still my clients. I'll continue to manage their policies. Good. So what was that big news you mentioned? What does this mean? It's a first class ticket. I can see that. Obviously it's something positive. Okay, but what does it mean? I'll be going away for a few days for a training course. So do you realize what this means? It means that the company is investing in me, preparing me for something really important. (laughs) So what do you think? I'm happy for you. Oh, come on, Alyson, what's wrong? Nothing. You're such a bad liar. A toast? My father just committed suicide. We moved to this house with all our things still to be in- Alyson, I understand you. You don't understand anything. Life has a cost, our child has a cost, and this is something big. Well, moving to this house is something big for me, a huge sacrifice. The least you could do was at least stay by my side. That's exactly what I'm going to do, and I'll do it as soon as I come back. Try to think about us. That's exactly what I'm doing. (Richard scoffs) Will she be coming with you? Your colleague, will she be coming with you? What's that supposed to mean? The same plane, a seat next to you, the same hotel? Will you be sharing a room, as well? I knew you would have brought this up again. Perhaps that's because you hurt me. Perhaps that's because you didn't realize how I felt. Come on, five years. It was five years ago. We said we wouldn't have spoken about it again because we had got over it. We would have carried on with our lives, but you are still there, stuck in the past. Well, you could have refused. Refused what, our biggest chance to finally sort things out once and for all? This wasn't the moment to go, Richard, and you know it. And you think if I had said no, my boss would have offered me the chance again in the future, do you really think that? Well, you could have at least spoken with him, explained to him the situation, ask him to postpone. But I bet you didn't even try, did you? That's what I thought. (slow ominous music) (Seth coos) (water trickles) (toy rattles) (slow ominous music continues) (toy rattles) (lock rattles) (slow music) (slow orchestral music) Mommy's not well, she's ill. She's very ill, but she'll get better soon. When? It's gonna take a long time, princess, but I promise you, she will get better. To regain victory, regain victory over evil that may surpass all- That's daddy's friend, he's come to visit us, and he's going to help Mommy. And two more friends are coming, too, all the way from America, and they love children. Let me tell you a secret. They have a huge house with lots of toys, and I've been there and had a great time playing with all of them, so you want to see it? Are you sure? It's fantastic, and you can take Mr. Bear with you, too. So do you want to go with them, you and Mr. Bear, just until Mommy gets better again? You'll have fun, you'll see. (doorbell rings) That must be them now. (slow ominous music) Alyson, if I don't get on that plane, they will send someone else in my place, and that will be bad news for the both of us. (sighs) Look at me. Everything will be fine. You and Seth will be fine and I'll be back before you even know I'm gone. (slow ominous music continues) (dog barks) (insects whirring) (slow ominous music) (circuit breaker clicks) (slow ominous music) (baby monitor crackles) (Seth cries) [Mary] Stop crying, I beg you, stop! (Alyson trembles) (Seth cries) Your breath, your breath is so warm. Now be quiet. (Alyson trembles) Silence! (Seth cries) (Alyson trembles) (slow ominous music) (phone vibrates) [Richard] Alyson, what's wrong? [Alyson] She wanted to take him away from me and it was terrible- - She? Who are you talking about? What's happening? [Alyson] I could feel her eyes on me. Are you both okay? [Alyson] I woke up, I couldn't move. You and Seth, are you okay? Yes, Seth is fine, he's here with me. (cries) It felt so real, Richard. She wanted to hurt us. [Richard] Who? I don't know who, she said she wanted to take him away from me, that she would have shut him up. [Richard] Alyson, now you need to calm down. It was a hallucination, one of your nighttime hallucinations. No, this time it was different. It wasn't like the others. Take a deep breath and calm down, please. [Alyson] I'm sorry, I shouldn't have called you. No, you did the right thing. [Alyson] Richard? What? [Alyson] When are you coming back? I'll be back soon. Now you need to try to relax. Are you taking your medication? Alyson? I'm listening. [Richard] Are you taking your medication? No, I- [Richard] Take it and go back to bed. Take Seth with you if it makes you better, but you need to get some rest, okay? Okay. Richard? [Richard] What? Come back soon. [Richard] Okay. Good night, Richard. [Richard] Good night. (slow ominous music continues) (ceiling creaks) (slow ominous music) (door creaks) (slow ominous music continues) (Alyson gasps) (slow ominous music) (birds chirping) [Anthony] No peeking, I can see you. One, two, three, four, five- Come on, let's run and hide. [Susan] Six, seven, eight. [Anthony] Behind that tree. [Susan] Nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15- [Anthony] What are you drawing? Let me see. Okay, so this is me and these are stairs, but, but who's this, is this Mommy? Why did you draw this? That's not Mommy. [Anthony] Susan, Susan, is that you? (slow ominous music continues) Susan? Jesus, Susan, you scared the life out of- As I've told you, we need to verify the type of disorder, whether it's psychological or paranormal. I'm often called for cases where a person is suffering from some sort of dissociative disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia, or the person is bipolar. In cases like these, I can do very little. Have you been to see a doctor? [Anthony] She started therapy about a month ago and she's taking psychiatric medication. And have there been any improvements? [Anthony] No, the situation seems to be getting worse and worse. Father Elbert, I need your help. (slow piano music) Stop it now. Susan, please, stop it, Susan. (slow ominous music) (ghostly voice whispers) (ghostly screaming) (doorbell rings) [Father Elbert] Yes? Um, I got your address from the parish priest in town. How can I help? My name is Alyson. About 25 years ago, a man came to ask you for help. He wanted to save his wife. That man was my father, his name was Anthony. I'm sorry, I don't remember that name. You have to remember it, you were in my home, you met my parents. I don't remember anything of the sort. I need to know. Many years have passed. You're confusing me for someone else. Can you please tell me what happened? There's nothing to tell, nothing to remember. Please don't waste any more of my time. It would be better for you to leave now. I can't help you. (door slams) Father Elbert, I need to know. I live in the same house with my husband and my son. I, I don't feel safe there. Please. (Alyson sighs) (birds chirping) (Seth coos) (footsteps pattering) (slow ominous music) (doorbell rings) Good morning, Alyson. Would you like a cup of tea? (bones cracking) Would you like a cup of tea? No, thank you. I expect you're wondering why I changed my mind. You have the same expression as your father had when I met him. In the attic the other night, I found a videotape from my father's video camera. There were images of him, my mother, me, and you, too. Me? Yeah. I guess you didn't know about that. Why did my father come to you? I believe you know the answer to that. Reality is, you're afraid of the truth. My father- Your father loved you. A love for a child can often bring about painful choices. Your father thought that by keeping you away from here, putting you up for adoption, you'd be safe. Safe from what? They always told me my mother died of cancer, is that true? What happened to her? Anthony came to me to ask for my help. He was convinced that there was an entity harboring in his wife. He was right. (slow dramatic music) (Susan pants) (slow dramatic music continues) You who represent the salvation of man, listen to the voices of your apostles, Peter and Paul, and of all the saints, who by your grace, gained victory over evil. Free your servant from this diabolical oppression and keep her unharmed, that she may return to the serenity of being your faithful child, to love you wholeheartedly, to serve you by doing good- Lies, lies, lies! And to honor you and bring you glory, her whole life being a song of praise to you. (slow dramatic music continues) Evil being, tell me your name. (Mary speaking in foreign language) I order you, evil one, seducer of mankind, recognize the spirit of truth and grace, the spirit that rejects your deceptions and unmasks your lies. Abandon this creature Susan. Through the anointing of his spirit, God has made you his holy temple. (Mary screams) (slow ominous music) (bones cracking) I order you to recognize the invincible power of Jesus Christ almighty. Remove this creature, abandon Susan's body, whom the savior, having been born amongst us, made her a sister, died upon the cross, redeemed her with his blood. Tell me who you are. I am the she who dwells in here. Tell me your name and leave this creature of God. (Mary speaking in foreign language) Christ orders you from the height of his power to abandon his child, what is you name? (Mary speaking in foreign language) I am the bride that was killed at the hands of this bloodline. (slow ominous music continues) I was unable to help her. In the following weeks, that evil being came back to torment him. He was terrorized. (slow ominous music) (slow piano music) (slow ominous music) (door creaks) (ominous orchestral music) Who's this being? Her name was Mary. She was your grandfather's first wife. When I'm paralyzed in my sleep, they always told me they were hallucinations. [Father Elbert] I'm afraid they aren't. What does she want from my family? The woman disappeared shortly after the wedding. The local authorities could find no trace of her. Your grandfather remarried and they had two children, Susan, your mother, and Eve. Only Susan survived. Good night, darling. Mommy, who are you talking to? (slow ominous music) (door slams) (child screams) (bones cracking) (ghostly voices whispering) (slow dramatic music) (ghostly whispering) (child screams) This evil is present in our world, Alyson. Have you sensed any presences in this house since you moved in? How did you feel these presences? I- [Father Elbert] Have you noticed anything strange in the last few days? Objects moving, noises? (slow ominous music) Alyson, Alyson? Are you listening to me, Alyson? (Alyson gasps) (slow dramatic music) (Alyson cries out) What is it, what's there? She's here. I want to get out of here. Alyson, listen to me. It's not the house that is damned. It's the family, there's a curse on all of you, you, your husband and your son, you're all in danger. What's going on here? Richard. My name is Father Elbert and I came here to help you. I don't understand. We have a problem. Problem, what are you talking about? What's been happening to your wife, they're not hallucinations or dreams. It's a soul in search of revenge. Are you serious? Revenge on your family. There is a chance that the bride can find peace if her remains are recovered, blessed, and buried in sacred ground. Okay, I've heard enough. Thanks for your visit, but now I have to ask you to leave. Richard, no, Father Elbert, please. It's all right, it's fine. I'll leave you two now. Richard, we need his help. Why would we be in danger? Just because of your nightmares? You've had them since you were a girl. You weren't here, you didn't see all the things that happened. We need him. A priest, you're an atheist. I know what I saw, you have to believe me. Alyson, you need to speak to somebody. (Alyson scoffs) Father, I'm so sorry. Don't apologize, sometimes it's difficult to believe in that which we don't understand. So finding the bride's remains, could that help? Come to me tomorrow morning. Bring the boy, don't leave him here. We will find a solution. (car engine sputters) (car engine stalls) (slow ominous music) (car engine stalls) (slow ominous music continues) (car door slams) (radio music blares) (slow ominous music) (car door slams) Our Lord, our Father, I ask and implore you for a straight put to flight and drive out all these diabolical powers and diabolical presences, Satanic machinations, every evil influence, (car door handle rattles) Every curse and evil eye. Bride. (slow dramatic music) (Alyson trembles) (Seth coos) Richard? Father Elbert. (slow ominous music) (slow dramatic music) (Alyson shrieks) Richard! (slow ominous music) Richard! (door rattles) Richard! The door won't open! (Alyson shrieks) (Alyson screams) (slow ominous music continues) (Mary roars) Alyson, what happened? Seth. (cries) (wind whistles) (Alyson cries) (camera lens clicks) Can you tell me what time you realized the baby was missing? It must have been around three. And the room is exactly how you found it, right? Exactly, we haven't touched anything. Do you have any reason to believe somebody could have any problems with you? Problems, with us? Yes, have you argued with anybody? Do you have any enemies here? No, as I told you, we've only just moved in. Usually these kinds of kidnappings are followed by ransom demands, so always answer your phone. Every incoming and ongoing call will be recorded. In the meantime, we'll do everything we can to find your child. There was a phenomenon in the living room. The door was closed and I just couldn't get them open, and I'm sure there was no one on the other side. Hmm. Can you show me the bedroom? [Alyson] Neither me or my husband had mentioned a bedroom, how did- - How did I know? [Alyson] Yeah. [Richard] What's in your pocket? Excuse me? [Richard] Your pocket, I can see you're playing with something. Yes. It's like a marble, I always carry it with me. It was given to me by, it was given to me a long time ago. And what does it do? It changes color. Now it's clear, see, that's good, that's positive. It means the situation around us is stable. There's no other presence here. When it goes gray, that means there is a presence, but that's usually a benevolent one. Most spirits don't mean us any harm. And when it goes very dark, that means, well. Well? Well, it means we're in trouble. Alyson, you felt these presences first, is that right? (slow orchestral music) I want you to hold onto the photograph of Seth and I need you to close your eyes. And whatever you hear, whatever you feel, I need you to keep your eyes closed, understand? Good, now I want you to visualize Seth, really focus on your son. And your thoughts will travel through you as emotions. Really try to see him in your mind's eye. That's very good, Alyson, very good. (slow ominous music) (stroller creaks) (slow ominous music continues) I am truly sorry for what happened to you, but I have not come here to negotiate. This family wants their son back, the child you have taken from them. (slow ominous music) (Mary scratching) (slow dramatic music) From what Father Elbert told you and from what I have been able to verify for myself, I have reached a conclusion, but I need to be very clear, this is just an opinion, it's a theory. We're here to listen to you. Okay. When I first came into this house, what I felt was anger, so much anger. (slow ominous music) The spirit we are dealing with wants revenge. She wants back what was taken from her. She craves life, but not just her own life, the fetus in the cradle. What does it mean? The bride was pregnant. When she was murdered, she lost not just her own life, but also that of her unborn child. The symbol on the wall tells me that she has asked for help from a very powerful and, uh, a very evil force. What, what evil force? As mode us, As mode us is a demon. He's a great king in the hierarchy of the infernal spirits. He's the lord of wrath and vengeance, and I think that's who you've been seeing in the house. He has granted the bride's spirit the power to return from the dead for revenge. And if we did what Father Elbert suggested, find the bride's remains, bless them, and- Find the bride's remains, bless them, and then bury them again. It's not going to bring Seth back. And on the contrary, it risks closing forever the link that is now open between our world and the bride's world. So how do we bring Seth back? There is one thing I think we can try, but you are going to have to trust me. I'm sorry, I should have believed you from the start. It can't have been easy for you to believe. (slow piano music) (Richard sighs) Forgive me. Bring our son back, hmm? Listen carefully, Alyson. You will meet many souls on this journey, and some of them will be familiar to you, others you will not recognize. Pay close attention to every single one of them, okay? [Alyson] Okay. Now, this device will sound to start your journey. It will also sound to end the journey and bring you back to us, and it's really important when that happens that you have Seth with you. So if you find him, don't let him out of your sight. You might need this, hold onto it. (slow music) You ready for everything that's going to happen? Yes. Okay, in that case, you can close your eyes. (static crackles) I want you to tell me about a happy memory. The birth of my child. [Dave] Where was he born, who was with you, Alyson? At the Craig General Hospital. Richard was there with me. [Dave] Okay, tell me more, as much detail as you can. I entered the operating room. My midwife was there with me, laughing and joking. Then two big pushes, and he came to the world. He was crying and they placed him in my arms, and I started crying, too. (laughs) I kissed him. The moment I looked into his eyes was the most beautiful moment of my life. Richard ran to me, tears running down his face, and he hugged me, thanking me for the son I have given him. [Dave] That's excellent, that's really good, Alyson. Now keep that happy memory with you as you start to relax. Take a nice big deep breath in, and relax, good, and in, and relax. And with each breath in, the body's going to relax more and more. Be aware of how the sound you can hear also helps the body feel more relaxed. Feel the fingers relax. Body starting to feel a little heavier now, but it's a very pleasant heaviness. Abandon yourself to those sensations you're feeling. That's good, your mind is active, but the body is feeling a little heavier. And we breathe in, and we sleep. And we breathe in, and we sleep. And we breathe in, and we sleep. [Alyson] Dave? What's happening? Nothing? It didn't work? Dave? (flashlight clicks) (Alyson trembles) Richard! Let me out of here! Dave, help! And now? Shh, now she's on her journey, we need to wait. (Alyson knocks) [Alyson] Help! (slow ominous music) (Alyson pants) (Mary scratching) (slow ominous music continues) (Mary scratching) (slow ominous music continues) (slow dramatic music) (Alyson shrieks) (slow ghostly whispering) (slow TV music) And then she said to me that she didn't want to go with them and that she wanted to stay with us. So I whispered to her, "I'm sorry, Alyson. I don't think that's a good idea." And she replied, "Please, Daddy, listen, please. Don't send me away with them." (audience laughs) (Susan laughs) So I turned around, I was about to close the door, (sighs) And she looked at me with tears in her eyes and said, "Bye bye, Daddy, I love you." (audience laughs) I know, I'll call her up on the phone right now and say, "Bye bye, little orphan girl, I love you." (audience laughs) (Susan laughs) No, that's not very nice, you can't do that to her. Seriously, so I can't write, "bye bye, little orphan girl, I love you," on a piece of paper and send it by fax? No. (audience laughs) (slow ominous music) [Susan] Wake up, darling, wake up. Mom? (slow piano music) Mom. Don't worry, everything's fine. Everything's fine, honey. Oh, you must have had a really bad dream. I love you, Mom. (cries) I love you, too. (slow piano music continues) But you're dead. Sooner or later, everybody dies. But that day is still far away. I came to bring you a hot water bottle. You've wet the bed. Oh, I'm sorry. Don't worry, let me change the sheets. All right. Don't worry, help me change the sheets. (slow ominous music) (thunder crashes) (Alyson gasps) (slow ominous music continues) (thunder rumbles) You seem nervous, Richard. Thanks for noticing. Everything's going as planned. How long before she comes back? I don't know the answer to that question. How long does it normally take in cases like this? I don't exactly do this kind of thing every day. How often have you done something similar? Christ. (scoffs) Richard, there's something in my brown bad I think I need. It's in the bedroom, will you get it for me? (thunder rumbles) (slow ominous music) (door creaks) (slow ominous music continues) (door rattles) Dave, Dave, you need to let me out. (door rattles) Dave? (water trickles) (slow ominous music continues) (slow dramatic music) [Woman] Good night, darling. [Child] Mommy, who are you talking to? (bones cracking) (child screams) (slow ominous music continues) (Nelson sobs) Eve, (cries) my princess. You didn't have to die. (cries) My little princess. It's all your fault! (slow dramatic music) It began with me, and with me, it shall end. Forgive me, Susan. (gun fires) (thunder rumbles) (slow ominous music) Richard? Richard? (thunder rumbles) Richard? (ominous orchestral music) (Dave cries out) Richard! Richard, don't look at the light! Richard! Richard, we've got to get out of here. (ominous orchestral music continues) (Dave trembles) I'm protecting this woman with sacred herbs. No evil spirits may harm her. I am protecting this woman with sacred herbs. No evil spirits may harm her. (door rattles) I am protecting this woman with sacred herbs. No evil spirits may harm her. I am protecting this woman with sacred herbs, no- (ominous orchestral music continues) I'm protecting this woman with sacred herbs. No evil spirits may harm her. I'm protecting this woman with sacred herbs. No evil spirits may harm her. Come on, Alyson. Come on. (slow ominous music) (slow dramatic music) Alyson, it's good to see you again. You've grown up to be a beautiful woman. I never should have sent you away from me. I always hoped you would have come and get me, that I would have seen you again. I made a terrible mistake. I left my only joy in the hands of others. But now we can make up for things. (slow piano music) We'll be together again, me, you, your mother. No. Yes, we'll be a family again. I, I came to look for my son. I know, and I can't wait to meet him. It's not possible, Dad, we're not staying. I'm taking him away from here. Losing your daughter is a painful experience. Losing her twice is heartbreaking. I was a terrible father and an even worse husband, but I can make up for that now. Everybody deserves a second chance. It can't happen, not anymore. We weren't together when we could have been. We can't be together now. Dad, please. Help me find Seth. Please. When you were younger, you always used to enjoy drawing. Do you remember? It was your way of communicating. I never understood any of your drawings, how could I? Perhaps one of them will help you to find your son. Alyson, go now, there isn't much time left. Thank you, Dad. (slow dramatic music) (water drips) (slow ambient music) (slow dramatic music) (Mary moans) You forced me to make a choice. You're scaring me, why are you doing this to me? You don't remember anything? No, I don't know what you're talking about. (slow ominous music) (Nelson cries) I am so sorry. Nelson, darling, look at me, it's me, your love, your wife. Let's go back home, I'm begging you. (cries) I'm pregnant! (slow ominous music) (gun cocks) I will devour your soul and the souls of the ones you love, dead son of a bitch, you'll never be free of me. (slow ominous music continues) (slow ghostly whispering) In the darkness, I will slaughter your children like pigs. (Mary speaking in foreign language) (Alyson cries) (Seth wails) (Alyson cries) (slow ominous music) (Seth coos) (slow dramatic music) (Alyson trembles) [Mary And Nelson] We won't let you go. We won't let you go, Alyson. We are a family now. We are a family, we won't let you go. We won't let you go, Alyson. [Mary] We are a family now. [Dave] Relax and breathe. (Alyson hyperventilates) Relax and breathe. (Alyson trembles) (slow dramatic music) Oh, you're okay. My baby. Okay, and deep breaths. - He was with me, he was- - I know. He was here with me. Try to stay calm, that's better, that's better. She took him away from me. I'm sorry, Alyson. Send me back. I can't. I have to go back. It's too dangerous. No, I, he, I have, I have to go back and get him. Sending you once was risky, I shouldn't have done it. Sending you twice could kill you. I don't care, you have to send me- I care. I care. You don't understand, he was, he was with me, he was here with me. Alyson. You did everything you could possibly have done. (Seth cries) Wait, Aly, Alyson, wait, it might not be safe, Alyson! (Seth cries) (slow piano music) Richard? I have to thank you once more for our baby. (Alyson cries) (slow piano music continues) [Dave] Richard. Dave. I was wondering when you would have come to see us. Well, I was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd pass by, just in time, I see. Yeah, we're leaving this afternoon. The estate agent will take care of all the other furniture. Good, where are you moving to? Oh, we found a small place on the East Coast. Nice, how are they both? They couldn't be better. Alyson is a completely different person now, much more serene. Excellent, are they home? Yes, they are. Anyway, I, I never thanked you for what you did for my family. Still can't get used to being thanked. I'm using being called a charlatan. (laughs) I can imagine. So I'll finish up here and I'll see you inside. Yeah. Alyson? Alyson? Hey, Seth. Hey, hello, little man, where's mommy? You don't know? (Seth coos) Hey, you want to play? You haven't got any toys. Hey, where are your toys? I've got something, hang on. It's not exactly a toy, but. (Seth coos) Hey, Dave. Hey, hi. [Alyson] When did you arrive? Just now, I did call out, you didn't hear me? Oh, no, I was upstairs, finishing packing all our things. Right, I just came to say goodbye. [Alyson] That's nice of you. Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. Um, look, I have to, I have to go. [Alyson] You seem worried. Worried? No. Should I be? No. Aren't you a bit old to be playing with marbles? Oh, I think you're much older than I am. (slow ominous music) This is the last one. (sighs) (slow ominous music continues) (footsteps pattering) (slow ominous music continues) (Seth cries) (slow dramatic music) (Richard trembles) (Alyson grunts) (slow dramatic music continues) (ax rattles) (glass shatters) (dramatic choral music) (slow piano music) (slow orchestral music)
