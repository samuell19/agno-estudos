But I was going to use this. I found it in a garage drawer. That's you, isn't it? Who's Jonah? Is that your brother? (smacks lips) Yup. That's my brother. Why don't you ever talk about Samoa? Did something happen? In life, things happen. You may not want them to, but they do. You just got to do your best... and move on. And the fact of the matter is I'm your family. I'm your people. - Me. - And you're a whole lot. - Oh, I am a whole lot. - (chuckles) Look at this. Perfect timing. Oh, no, this is the mini. - Yup. - Thank you so much. - Cheat day? - Cheat day. Yeah. Thank you so much. Is that really necessary? Come on! She's 71 years old. What's the matter with you lot? Sir, the prisoner will only be allowed more leniency when she proves to be less of a security risk. If someone leaves a back door open, it's a bit daft not to try and use it. What's daft is paying one of the screws to leave it open but not paying them enough to keep their mouth shut. Yeah, well, my point still stands. If you can't break out of a shitty prison like this, then you're seriously slipping, Mum. You cheeky bugger. Speaking of breaking out, where's my birthday cake? What, the one with the file in it? - They're baking it. - Who wants a bloody file? What I want is a nice little bit of C-4. Listen, if you want out of here, just say the word; I'll handle it. Oh, Decks, I'm just having a bit of fun, really. Being banged up doesn't bother me. I quite enjoy the peace and quiet. You know, nice walk, bit of reading, loads of sudoku. It's like being retired. Love it. Now, listen, have you spoken with your sister? You know I haven't, Mum. - Give me your hand. - There she goes. I mean, you and your sister, y-you used to be inseparable. What happened, Decks? What happened between you? I remember you, Owen and Hattie playing out in the backyard. Your little games, your little grifts. Oh, robbing banks. You used to give your little scams code names. (laughs): Do you remember? Oh, what was that one? - Um... - The Keith Moon. MAGDALENE: (laughs) Yeah, that's right. It was called "The Keith Moon" because it... SHAW: It involved lots of explosive percussion and permanent ear damage. ♪ Yeah! ♪ (laughs) That's my boy. No wonder we left the family business. She loves you, you know. All you got to do is pick up the phone, Decks. Look at me. You're her big brother. She looks up to you. Used to. Well, one day, I just hope that I walk through that door and I see the two of you sitting there. How many years you got left? Two, with good behavior. - So how many, really? - Four. Well, you know what they say. Never say never. GUARD: Time's up. - You behave yourself. - Will do. Love you, darling. (kisses) Love you, too. (kisses) (Magdalene laughs) (music playing quietly over speakers) All right. LOCKE: Lucas Rebecca Hobbs. I haven't seen you in forever. - "Rebecca"? - Do you even age? - How long's it been? - Six months. - Time flies. - When we're apart. What is your skin care regimen? - Because you look like... - Don't sit down. ...a young Shirley Temple. (whispers): Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Daddy, who is this guy? Well, this guy is, uh, is Locke. And he works for the CIA. Dad and I are old friends. - We're not old friends. - Actually, we're, um... we're best friends. Here's the half heart. - I don't know what that is. - Right there. We got some ink together as well. - We did not get ink together. - Oh, we didn't? - No, we did not. - Huh. Interesting. - We never got ink together. - Well, I seem to remember getting a little something like this - at one point on my body. - Jesus. Christ, I miss our playful banter. You have one minute to tell me what you want before I knock one of your lungs loose. You and I are after the same thing. Say hello to the CT17 virus. It's a programmable bioweapon of biblical proportions, affectionately code-named "the Snowflake." - What does the Snowflake do? - Oh, nothing much. Just, uh, liquefies your internal organs. Basically turns your body into a giant bag of hot soup. - She is nine. - Seen worse. - Where? - Game of Thrones. - Janet's house. - I've never heard of it. A Lannister always pays his debts. You're never going over there again. LOCKE: But there's a new wrinkle in the case, Rebecca. The specifics are all in the brief. There you go. - She's ready, Becca. - She's nine. She's nine. This is the only unit of CT17 in existence, and this Snowflake is now in the hands of a rogue MI6 operative in London. Dad, are all spies that pretty? No. She is unusually attractive. And deadly. Last night, she was part of an MI6 team tasked with securing the virus. She then proceeded to kill her entire black ops squad. She stabbed one guy in the chest using a brick. Do you know how hard that is? - To stab someone using a brick? - Get to the point. The point is there's no sharp edge. How did she get an entire brick into another person's chest? She either had to be really strong or the other person had to have been, like, born without, like, bones. - Get to the larger point. - She stole the Snowflake. - She went totally off-grid. - Who's this? That's the scientist we believe created the virus. Great. Where do I find him? He's off-grid, too. Impossible to find. - Maybe dead. - You're very helpful, Locke. And you're the world's best tracker. I'm sure you'll figure something out. Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm DSS, you're CIA. - I don't work for you. - Your boss loaned you out. You do now, dick face. - What did you call me? - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Let's just settle down. All right? We've already got a black site running in London. There's an operative there, top of his game. - He'll be your contact. - I don't need anybody else. - I work alone. - We got bigger problems than your fragile ego or the fact that a moment ago I most definitely shit my pants. The entire world is at stake here, all right? This thing gets out, we're looking at a lot of liquefied organs, and I mean, like, everywhere. And not just yours and mine. Uh, he knows I can see him, right? He knows nothing, Jon Snow. (Sam chuckles) So what's it gonna be, Becky? You gonna partner up? - I'm in. - Of course you are. Do you remember what I told you in Rwanda? - "It still burns"? - No. The other thing. "Stop watching me sleep." I said, "We are not..." - We're best friends. - "...friends at all." - And to watch your back. - Wash your back. - Yeah. I remember. - W-Watch your back. Lot of back. I got you. Hey. Same old Hobbs, huh? Same old Locke. All right. Who's on the case? (man speaking indistinctly over P.A.) Mr. Shaw. Whatever it is, I ain't buying it. Hm, you don't know what I'm selling or who I am. - CIA. - How can you... Sunglasses, cloudy day, sensible shoes. Okay, well, these are... I have fallen arches, and I don't have a lot of choice in what I... Anyway, uh, I'm Agent Loeb, and I need to talk to you - about our shared interest. - Hey, how'd you find me? I got a tip from an acquaintance of yours: - Mr. Nobody. - Mr. Nobody. Little joke for you, Loeb. What do, uh, CIA operatives and baseballs have in common? People cheer when you hit them with a bat. No. They are two things I don't give a toss about. - That works, too. - (car door opens) The weapon she's stolen is not like anything we've ever seen. It's a programmable disease that can target any DNA sequence with a 100% mortality rate inside 72 hours. If MI6 finds her, they're gonna treat her like a traitor. MAN (over phone): We need you to surrender the virus. What is your location? What, you think I killed them? LOEB: But if you help us find her, if you bring us the virus, we'll grant her immunity. We've set up a black site here in London. You've got everything you could need at your disposal, and we're bringing in an asset from the States to assist you. I don't need anybody. Maybe not, Mr. Shaw, but she does. - My guy's in. - My guy's in, too. Hey, is your guy gonna freak out when he finds out who my guy is? I mean, didn't they just do a job together in New York? Yeah, but didn't they just destroy the DSS field office in L.A. by throwing each other through it? I don't know. Look, I don't know about your guy, but my guy? He's gonna get this. He's gonna pull this off. You know why? We've been best friends our whole goddamn lives. Well, my guy beat the shit out of me at a bar in Kraków 17 years ago, and he doesn't even remember me. So, we all have our histories. Anyway, it's the fate of the world here. It's the fate of the world. The planet's population is in their hands. - Serious stuff. - I mean, you'd think they'd be able to put aside any petty rivalries to save the world. - Mm. Mm. - (slurping) BOTH: No fucking way. No, I'm not working with this guy. I been there, done that. Hey, the minute he gets involved, you can kiss goodbye to any finesse, because She-Hulk here only knows how to smash. Yeah, and Mr. Arson here only knows how to blow shit up. - And the fact is... - And the fact is... - No offense. - Oh, no offense. BOTH: This guy's a real asshole. That's, uh, "sumbitch" in your native tongue. That'd be "wanker" in your native tongue. Are you finished blubbering? You sound like a giant tattooed baby. You know what, I'm not listening to this horseshit. I got a job to do. Tell your mom I said hi. Actually, I'll tell her myself. Don't you ever talk about my mother. I'll put your head through that wall. Secondly, I'll have this job done while you're still putting on your baby oil. Good luck, slick. - (snaps fingers) - That's it. You just reminded me. That's exactly why I hate working with you. It's your voice. It's your nasally, prepubescent, Harry Potter voice. Every time you speak... just imagine this for a second... it's like dragging my balls across shattered glass. And it hurts. Well, for me, it's not your voice. It's your face. Your big, stupid face. Looking at it makes me feel like God is projectile-vomiting right in my eyes. And it burns. (inhales deeply) It really burns. (chair creaking) What you gonna do now? Throw a bit of furniture? For your information, I was gonna take this chair and turn it sideways and shove it - right down your throat. - Of course you were, 'cause that's your answer to everything. Smash a hole through every problem in a massive truck. But that's not gonna work here. - Ah, I think it'll work fine. - AGENT: Guys? Why don't you two take a seat and we'll talk through this? (feedback squeals) Me and you, us... I've been down this road. It's a total waste of time. For once, I couldn't agree with you more. Yeah? Well, I'm doing this my way. If anyone's got a problem with that, I suggest you come out here and stop me. I'm not going in there. Well, I'm not going in there. Smart lads. HOBBS: All right. (chuckles) Now that we got rid of that fun sponge, we can get to work. I want you to pull up every CCTV camera around Central London. We already have two dozen agents scouring footage... Don't you talk back to me, Opie. Uh-uh. I just care about the coverage. I ain't gonna ask you again. Now pull it up. Now zoom in on the area of the heist. - Now invert it. - (typing) Highlight the areas that the cameras don't cover. She's smart. She just killed her entire team and stole a deadly virus.

(growls) (grunting, yelling) (metal clangs on floor) (grenade spinning on floor) - (beeping) - (panting) SCIENTIST: The director called. He ordered a new baseline for you. He has everything ready for you in medical. DIRECTOR (distorted voice): Perfection is a painful process, Brixton, in ourselves and in the pursuit of a perfect world. Humanity must evolve before it destroys itself. - Eteon will carve out all human weakness... - (yells) ...and replace it with mechanical perfection. And you will lead the way. I'm gonna ask you a question. It's not what you think it is. Do you like to dance? What, the Electric Slide? The Macarena? No, I don't. No, no, no, I was thinking about... the tango, where it takes two. Yeah, don't know that one. Must be different generations. (laughs) Yeah, well, either way, the music started, so let's see what kind of rhythm you have. - Where's the virus? - Look, I told you, I've no idea - what you're talking about. - Okay, that hurt. You just stepped on my toes. That didn't feel good. Let's try it again. I think you're better than that. - Where's the virus? - I didn't ask to dance. And why should I talk to you? You're not CIA. No? How do you know that? Where shall I start? There's two types of CIA agents: intelligence and espionage. Those guys over there can barely lift a pencil. That's what intelligence agents look like. And you look like you could pick up a building. But espionage is about blending in, about being subtle, and there is nothing subtle about you. Yeah. That's good. I'm impressed. I didn't kill anybody. I know you didn't. How do you know that, then? Because you can learn a lot about somebody when you fight them, and when we fought, you weren't fighting to kill me. You were fighting to run away. But either way, the world thinks that you're a murderer and a thief, so you're not going anywhere or getting any goddamn phone call until you give me some real answers. You have no idea what is happening here. Then tell me. Help me understand. - I can't. - Then I can't, either. - You're wasting my time. - You're wasting time. Virus gets in the wrong hands, that's it... it's game over. (alarm ringing) (chuckles) Does that mean it's time for curls? Just like the CIA, always flexing the wrong muscle. You know, the mind is the strongest muscle in the body. Maybe you should try exercising that a little bit more. "There's more wisdom in your body than in your deepest philosophies." Ooh, let me guess. That Bruce Lee? (laughs) No, Nietzsche. 'Cause I'm flexing this. And all of that. Come here. If she moves, I want you to shoot her. Yeah, he can't shoot me. - Yeah, not allowed. - HOBBS: In the face. No, you can't, not in the face. You'd go to prison. You can shoot her right in the face. No, you can't. You'd go to prison. Sorry. I want you to shoot her two times right in that face. - Okay? - Uh... SAM (over phone): Hi, Dad. Did you catch the hot spy lady? Come on, it's me. I catch everybody I hunt. How long have you been doing this? Because you seem new. (groaning) She's actually quite annoying. You know, Dad, sometimes people annoy each other when they're actually, like, flirting. Where'd you hear that from? (grunting and groaning) Okay, look, uh, me and the spy lady, we're not flirting, all right? Zero chemistry. (groaning) (tires squeak) (engine revs, shuts off) I don't know. When you saw her photo, you definitely gave the eyebrow. - What eyebrow? - You know, Dad, that thing that you do. What thing? - I don't do that. - Yes, you do. No, I d... I definitely don't do that. I don't even know what you're doing. That's the silliest thing I've ever seen. Let me get going... I got business to take care of... and I'll see you when I get home, okay? - I love you. - Love you. Hey, one more thing. - (Sam laughs) - (chuckles) (choking) Goddamn it.

Hat, there are people after you. - Believe me, I know that. - Yeah, it's gonna stay that way unless you tell me where that virus is. Listen to me, pinhead. She's gonna die if I don't get her out of here right now. We're all gonna die if she doesn't tell us where that weapon is. Actually, everyone's gonna die, 'cause I am the virus.

Apparently, they control the media as well. Heard rumors about these people. Everybody thinks they're a myth. SHAW: I've seen it firsthand how real they are. If you don't fit into their plans, - you've already dug your own grave. - All right. Let's get to the nearest lockdown facility... Hey, no, no, no, no. You don't get it, do you? Brixton's a tier-one assassin. Best I've ever seen. I know him. He ain't never gonna stop until he gets that virus. And besides, that's my sister. Family business. Is your name Shaw? No. Then she's going nowhere with you. HOBBS: When it comes to the fate of the world, it becomes my business. I don't care if she's your sister. That woman ain't going anywhere... - BOTH: Where are you going? - I'm going away. I don't have time for your alpha male shit right now. You're both idiots. You clearly can't work together, and so you're absolutely useless to me. So I'm gonna go find the man who can help me get this thing out of my system. - See you. - HOBBS: You mean this man? I was tracking him before the attack. He's hard to find, but I think I got a hell of a lead. - Russian newspaper. - Not just any old paper. There's only one place in London that sells that.
