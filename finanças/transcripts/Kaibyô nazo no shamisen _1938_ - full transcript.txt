MASHIDA FILMS The Ghost Cat and the Mysterious Shamisen Director: Kiyohiko USHIHARA Writer: Kenji HATA Producer: Masaichi NAGATA Cinematographer: Takenori TAKAHASHI Music: Moriyoshi KURE Cast Mitsue: Sumiko SUZUKI Mojiharu: Shizuko MORI Okiyo: Kinue UTAGAWA Seijiro: Shinpachiro ASAKA Onui: Mitsuko MORI Why, hello there. Oh, hello. You're back again. I came to check up on Kotojiro. That's what older sisters are for. Kotojiro's a lucky boy. He's sure to become a great actor with your support. Mojiharu. -Kotojiro, there you are. -Okay, we're off. Enjoy. Seijiro. -Listen... -Yes? Why were you chatting with that woman? You mean Mojiharu? It was just small talk. For a mere shamisen player, you're more popular than actors. Don't be silly. Well, will you meet me at the usual spot? Sure. Promise? Oh, Master. Seijiro, we need to talk. Come inside. I know you're young and want to enjoy some romance. But don't let it consume you. Your recent shamisen playing hasn't been stable at all. Your future as a performer is grim if you neglect to practice your craft. But with enough training, you have the potential to become a master. This training period comes only once. It'd be a shame to waste it on a girl. What do you think? I'm not saying you need to get rid of her. I just want you two to be patient so you can focus on training for a while. Is this making sense to you, Seijiro? Kuro? How strange. Where did she go? Here kitty, Kuro? Welcome home, sir. -What happened to Kuro? -She went missing this afternoon. That's strange. She's never run off like this before. Go ask the neighbors. This is very worrisome. Yes sir. -Someone's here. -Who is it? I believe this cat belongs to you. Thank you! That's definitely our cat, Kuro. Where did you find her? She was lying on the street having been bitten by a dog. She was in much pain. Sorry for all the trouble. Kuro was bitten? Thank you. We're very grateful. She even attended to Kuro's wound. Thank you for everything. It was no trouble. I was simply lending a small helping hand. You needn't thank me. Well, I should be leaving. It was kind of you to come by. Good-bye. Thank you again. Oh dear, are you enjoying yourself? Mitsue, you can't barge in like this. What do you expect? You promised to meet with me and that woman got in the way. That's nonsense. We'd never met before. Why should I believe you? Looks like you broke off our arrangement so you could see her. Okay, I was wrong not to show up. But you should know, it wasn't to meet with her. She was simply returning Kuro, don't you see? Hey, let's forget about it. Too late now. I was watching you. I saw you talking to her. You can't fool me. You've been drinking again. Come back when you're sober. Do you see? She's taken a liking to you. My, you're right. Cute little Kuro. I think you should be thanking Kuro. Oh, why is that? If it weren't for Kuro, you wouldn't have met Seijiro. That's true. You have feelings for him, yes? Don't tease me. I knew it. Seijiro mentioned your name and was singing your praises. Oh, how so? You have beauty and talent rarely seen. You also have a solid base and you're a very fast learner. He has high hopes for you. I'm flattered. By the way, shouldn't he be home already? Are you worried? No, it's just... For now, just look after Kuro the matchmaker. I'll bring you some tea. Please come here. Now! What is it? -Just now... I heard a strange cry. I think it may have been Kuro. Would you go look? -A cry? -Yes. Seijiro? What are you doing here? Not much. I just happened to walk by and I was reminded of Kuro. I see. When I first found Kuro here, she was this small. She looked lost and insecure. She was being mistreated so I decided to take care of her. Poor cat. How pathetic of you. A grown man crying over a little cat. Welcome back. Have you found anything? Yes, it wasn't hard at all. Who is she? She's the daughter of Tanomo, a samurai. And? I took the initiative and sent her father an anonymous letter. Hopefully he'll cut off their relationship. He's strict? Where's Okiyo? At shamisen rehearsal. She's returning soon. We need to talk. Bring her back. Yes, Father. Okiyo, there you are. I've returned, Father. Okiyo! No more shamisen rehearsals. I forbid you to go out. That's final. Why? What have I done wrong? You ought to ask yourself. Shame on you. What do you mean by that? Don't play dumb. I hadn't seen you for so long, I thought you may have fallen ill. But I see... So someone thinks we rehearse just as an excuse to meet secretly? Who'd say such a thing? I don't know who but someone wrote to my father. It was a most cold-hearted letter. I don't know anyone who'd be so unkind. But your father would be furious if he could see us here together. Seijiro, I... I left at the risk of never returning home again. So you left home? Yes. You shouldn't have. What do you plan to do now? Seijiro, I beg of you. Please let me stay with you. I could be your maid. I refuse to obey my father. It would pain me to part with you. Please have mercy on me. I can't. You must go home. Seijiro! I'm flattered to know how you feel. But I'm betrothed to a woman named Mitsue Bando. Compared to a lady like you, I know she may be inferior. However, we've exchanged vows and I cannot break that promise. Even if I weren't betrothed, you're the daughter of a samurai. You don't belong with a lowly performer like me. Please understand. This is for your sake. But, Seijiro... ...I can't go back! I see. It may be difficult for you to be accepted back home. But you musn't worry your father any further. You must go. Come here. Why must you be so cold with Okiyo? Please understand what difficult situation she is in. Stay out of it. Listen, you go on and take her back home. Sir... Hurry up. Madame... Come with me. We have to go back. Let's go. Okiyo. As you know, this is my shamisen, Hatsune. It's the most precious possession that I have. I'd like to give it to you as a parting gift. If I could, I would give you Kuro, in memory of how we first met, and because I know she liked you. I still feel I should give you something precious as a memorandum. This shamisen is the best I can do. I hope that you will treasure it in memory of knowing me. Please keep it close to you, and look after it well. Seijiro! And with that... -You're going to Seijiro's? -That's right. Everything worked out? She hasn't been back since. He looks concerned, but he hasn't figured out what happened yet. Perfect. But don't forget: you owe me. Of course! I knew you'd be good for it. Have a good visit! She had a shamisen. It looked like Hatsune! What's it to you? You've got some nerve! You said you'd never give it away! "This shamisen's worth more than life itself" "I couldn't give it away, even to you." Your words exactly. But you gave it to her? I had good reason to do so. I don't want to hear it. I'm an established actress, you know. I won't let that brat just have her way. I'll get it back, just you wait! Mitsue! Oh dear, it's about Okiyo. She has... What is it? I was walking her home and she slipped away. What? Since the day she left, we haven't heard from her. Father is still very angry but he can't help his worrying. There are nights when he doesn't get a wink of sleep. Father is old and it saddens me to see him so worried. If you know my sister's whereabouts, do tell me, please. I'm terribly sorry. Had we been more careful, your sister would be here now. Please accept my apology. -You're sure? -Not a single doubt. Whoever it is, I never forget a woman's face once I've seen it. Take my word for it. You hear that? It's unmistakably the sound of Hatsune. That's impressive. Without even seeing the shamisen, you've guessed that it's Hatsune. You have quite an ear. Well, I'm used to hearing... Hey, I know how close you and Seijiro are. No need to say. There once was a young maiden... Nobody's listening. Over there. Do you want to take a closer look? No, that won't be necessary. -I'm sure it's Okiyo. -That's right. You can go now. My pay? -This'll get you a drink. -Good doing business with you. Excuse me now. Okiyo. Who are you? I'm Mitsue Bando. Can I help you with something? I've come for one thing. Give me that shamisen You refuse? I can't! Seijiro gave it to me. It's more precious than life itself! You have no right to take it from me. Don't get smart with me. Give up already. The rats are acting up. It sure is a spooky evening. I don't feel like drinking. Hey, Osen. Are you just going to hold that thing all day? Go ahead and play it. You've always wanted a shamisen, right? That's true, but... it's been in the water. It works! You're right. What a strange shamisen! This is how the story was told... What a useless shamisen. How'd you get in here? Looks like a human face. What a creepy cat. Go away! What's wrong? How dare you throw that bottle of sake at me! What are you saying? Oh, my leg... I can't move it, help me please. What's happening? The cat! I'll give it back! Take your shamisen and leave me be! My leg hurts... You love to hear Seijiro play the shamisen. It's not his playing. It's his handsome face that she's after. Isn't that right? We got this used shamisen today. Would you like to try? Starring Mitsue Bando Thoughts, sir? She's the one. You know what to do. Yes, sir. Mitsue. Come closer. Take the cup. Yes, sir. Here. The Lord of this region offers a drink, you take it. Go on. Seijiro. Let me give you a drink. What about me? No, let me pour it! -No, I couldn't accept it. -Please, Seijiro, accept my drink! Won't you drink? Why don't you drink together? Let's drink to Seijiro! It's too bad for us he's already spoken for! My Lord. Please be informed that the stage will be starting soon. I see. Let us go then. How'd you like to have a secure and luxurious life? Well? Or do you regret betraying your man? If I did, would I be here? Then, it's a deal. The Lord's mistress... Sounds lovely. Hey! You were eavesdropping? Get in here! Who is he? Seijiro, a shamisen player. He's very popular with women. What business do you have eavesdropping on us? Hey, answer me! Did you enjoy the play? Yes, it was very fun. -There it goes again. -What is it? An owl, I think. Hearing that owl gives me the shivers. Well, it's not very pleasant. Hanbei, you're my precious one. Oh? The lamp must be out of oil. Will you take a look? Yes! What's wrong? Nothing. It must be my imagination. Oh dear, this was a brand new string. Useless shamisen. How rude... Okimi, did you just say something? What's that scary look? That's my shamisen. Won't you give it back? How could you! Okimi! Take this far away and get rid of it. Hold on, go out the back. Hey! Come back! This is yours, isn't it? No. Hey, yes it is. How could you forget something this big? Take it. Drink up. I've already had enough. All right then, let me give you a hand. But...everyone's watching! What do you mean? All of your attention is distracting Mitsue. She's a shy lady. Look away! Now you ought to be fine. As I promised you before, let me serve you a drink. There. Ready? Drink up. Well done! Madame! I found this out front. That's strange. Who would throw this away? It might belong to the actresses entertaining the Lord. That can't be, they wouldn't. I've drunk too much. Come back here. Hey, Mitsue. Time for one more drink. What's all the noise? Tanomo, what are you doing here? My Lord. You feigned illness to avoid your duties and now you're entertaining yourself? That's not how a ruler behaves. On top of it all, you've invited good-for-nothing performers. How could you do such a thing? Tanomo, keep your mouth shut. Elders like you don't belong here. Now get out. Onogi, sir. How can you sit here and allow this debauchery? This is a disgrace! That's enough, I said get out! This is no place to socialize with women. Should word of this reach the government, what will you do? Shut up, Tanomo! And who is this woman you keep with you? Why do you care? I'm here on the Lord's order to accompany his highness. I won't stand for it, you lowlife. You make me sick! Well, the Lord invited me himself. Get out! Or I'll make you! Tanomo! Step back or you'll regret it! Get this woman and the other actresses out of this residence. Get to it. If not, I'll take care of this myself. Okiyo! You've become so frail. But I'm so glad to see you. Father is going to be relieved. Okiyo. I'm... so very happy. Onui, Father must still be quite angry with me. No. Although he says things like, "No daughter of mine shall be immoral," and "don't ever speak of her again," deep in his heart, he loves you dearly. Ever since you left home, Father's hair is going gray because of all of the stress. Despite his angry words, he misses you more with every passing moment. I'm such a bad daughter. Please forgive me, Father. Of course he'll forgive you. Father has waited so eagerly for this day to come. Okiyo, please don't ever run away like this again. I'll make sure to give Father my apologies as well. Thank you, Onui. I've put you through so much but you never stopped caring. I appreciate it with all my heart. But you should know... Father suffered as I did a most tragic death in the name of Mitsue Bando. Okiyo, you must be... I know it's hard to believe. But you'll soon realize that what I'm saying is true. When that time comes, you must stay strong. Then, I... I don't know what you mean. There's one more thing. That shamisen is precious to me as it was a gift from Seijiro. I don't want it in anyone else's hands. Please take it and return it to Seijiro himself. Okiyo! Well then, I've left it to you. When you see Seijiro, please give him my regards. I don't believe it. Onui! There's been trouble! What? Is it my father? Father! Everyone, what happened to my father? There's nothing we can say. Forgive us. Father suffered as I did a most tragic death in the name of Mitsue Bando. This is unmistakably Hatsune, the shamisen I gave to Okiyo. So it's true. My sister did indeed pass away. It's just as she said. May I see it? This is the very shamisen that I had Okimi throw away. What a strange fate. The fact that this found it's way to Onui is a testament to the memories we have of the late Okiyo. Onui. Having lost your father, you no longer have a home. If you'd like, please feel free to stay here until things settle down. She betrayed me. You must be mad to think I'd accompany her on stage! I know how you feel. But Master says he won't sing unless you play the shamisen. Come on, do it as a favor. There are other performers. If she won't perform without me, find another actress! In any case, I refuse to go on stage. I give up. You're one stubborn man. What can I do... I'll let Master know. Excuse me. Sorry to put you through this. Seijiro, I heard what you said. I understand why you don't want to perform. The opening performance is going to be Mitsue’s last. Hold on a minute. How can it be her last? I don't understand. Let me explain. My little brother Kotojiro was chosen to be a monkey in the play. I was aware of that. We thought Onui could take his place as the monkey. With the costume, it'll be difficult to tell. I don't know what you're trying to get at. When I found out that Mitsue would be performing for the last time in "Utsubo-zaru," I knew what I had to do. Since then, I went to a Master and trained as hard as I could. I memorized the choreography all for my father and sister. I plan to avenge their deaths. You mean on stage? Yes. But you must perform with Hatsune if we are to do this for Okiyo's sake. I see. I'll do it. Will you really? Of course I will. I'll do it for Okiyo's memory, and your father. I will play my heart out. Thank you so much. Kotojiro's part is coming up soon. Where is he? No idea. Hey, have you seen him? Nope Kotojiro! Kotojiro! He's not here? Onui, you must hurry out there. Sorry I'm late. Where is he? We've looked everywhere. No sign. As I stroke you gently, you listen to me carefully. You promise me to make sure... In your next life You will come back as a human child My Lord, did you see what he just did? You mean the monkey wasn't aware you were going to kill him and performed his tricks? The monkey gets to live. Take him with you now I cannot thank you enough, my Lord. My Lord, the monkey! Is it sabotage?
