What y'all doing tonight? - We're having a fire. - Would you do me favor and you just don't tell anyone I'm here? - Nance already did. You're welcome to join, but you will be painting tomorrow, so you might wanna think about getting some rest. - I'm painting? - Yeah, yeah, to start with. This ain't a charity, Lee. We ain't them derelicts you spit on, and we ain't partying no more. We work, when we come home, we work some more. So don't expect a repeat. Ain't no one taking your shit a second time, you got it? - Is that you talking or is that Nancy talking? - (laughs) You know where the door is.

I do miss them. - Yeah, they're well. They're down in Florida. - Next time you speak to 'em, tell 'em I'm thinking of 'em. - Oh, I will. - You know, Leslie, we still pray for you. No matter what's been done, the church is still here for you. I hope you know that. - Well, sorry for the interruption. And I hope you all have a good night and God bless. And ya know, I'm just gonna be over here enjoying myself, if you get tired of ole saddle bags here. - See you around, Lee. - Yeah, you will. - I apologize.
