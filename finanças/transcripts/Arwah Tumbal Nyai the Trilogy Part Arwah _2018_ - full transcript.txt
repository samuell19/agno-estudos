(Dalipah, the young talented dancer, is dead without clothes.) =Arwah Tumbal Nyai= So, you want to go there? -Yes. -You better not. If your grandma knows that you go... Don't tell her that I went there. But you have to promise,... don't hit the drum three times. If you do that, the demon of that house will come out. Everyone in this village knows about that too. Mrs. Idah. Have you ever seen Nyi Imas dance jaipong? She was a very famous jaipong dancer. She was a role model in this village. Which one do you think dances better between her and my late mom? They were the same. But ever since that tragedy,... she never leaves the house anymore. Do not enter! Why can't I? Do not enter! -You want to get into that house? -Yes. Grandma will be mad at you. I want to learn jaipong dance from Nyi Imas. No, Yani. Come with me. Come. Yani. Come on. Idah! Idah! Yes, Madam. Other than you, has anyone else been in this room? No one. -Yani? -No. Okay. Clean up the room. Are you serious with Shakti? Why are you asking me that, Grandma? You've been dating him for many years. But I don't see any sign that he would propose you. Grandma. You can't wait to have a great grandchild? Do you really have to ask? Grandma. Do you know that... I love you so much? Grandma. In the neighboring village,... they held a jaipong performance. What's wrong, Grandma? I'm not allowed to be a jaipong dancer? I want to be able to dance, just like mom. Eventually you will find out why I forbid you to learn jaipong. Are you afraid that if I become a jaipong dancer,... ...I will disappear like mom? Like any other jaipong dancer in this village? Yani, I will be happier if we talk about something else. Miss! Miss Yani! Miss, where are you going? To Nyi Imas's house. Oh, no. Please don't go there. I'm sure Nyi Imas knows where my mom has gone. Because the only jaipong dancer in this village is Nyi Imas. Yeah, but... if your grandma knows,... she will be furious. Who are you? I'm Syurkiani, Indah Sari's daughter. What do you want by coming here? I'm sure you know where my mom is. Get out. If you don't know where my mom is,... please teach me jaipong dance. Get out. Get out! I want to be able to dance. I want to be famous like my late mom. Please, teach me jaipong dance. Please. With one condition. What's the condition? I will do it. Hit that drum three times. So, when are you going to propose Yani? Don't just smile. If another man comes and proposes to her, you will regret it. Next month, Grandma. Let's wait until my parents come back from India. Yani can't wait for that. What are you talking about? Why did you say that? Beside, Shakti doesn't have an intention to propose to me. You hear that? She dares you to propose her. Next month, Grandma. I promise. -Next month? -Sure. If you don't propose to her next month,... I will arrange her marriage with another man. Great, Grandma. I love you so much. You are the kindest grandma, the most beautiful grandma. You're the one who hit that drum. You're the one who hit that drum! -No, Grandma. -Don't lie! You hit that drum four times! You have summoned them! Grandma. Grandma. Grandma! What is this, Yani? I don't know. I found it in my grandma's hand. But I hit that drum four times... and those demons wasn't suppose to come out. You have summoned them. But I know the demons will come out if I hit the drum three times. Why didn't you hit it three times? -I was scared the demons would come out. -They are already out. Four means death. Yani, you should move from this house. But it's useless, Shakti. Useless. Why? No matter where I go, those demons will follow me. I will stay with you here. Yani. Lidia. Are you all right? I asked Lidia to come here. After we talked on the phone last night,... I took the initiative to call the psychic. I'm doing this to help you, Yani. You know I don't believe this kind of stuff. We have to try this, Baby. -Please try to understand. -Shakti's right. Pardon me. All the supernatural beings in this house. I ask you to leave this place. Because the people here are good people. Please do not disturb them. Once again, I ask you to leave this place. Go back to your own world. Hurry and go back! Go back to your own world. Go back. Go back, okay? Thank you, Darling. Are you sure you don't want to sleep in the guest room? -I'll be here. -Good night. Shakti. Yani. Yani. Let's get out of here. I'm sure it has something to do with grandma. -I'm sure about it, Shakti. -What do you mean? Do you know where this key is? Hairpin? Dry blood. I bet Nyi Imas knows about it. -Stop! -What is it, Darling? He once forbid me to go to Nyi Imas's house. -I want to talk to him. -Yani. Aki! Wait. You're the one who forbid me to go to Nyi Imas's house. Why did you do that? Hairpin. Do you know what this hairpin means? Respati. The owner of this hairpin... wants to have beauty for the rest of her life. She wants to live an eternal life. In order to achieve that,... the owner of this hairpin had to kill jaipong dancers... with this hairpin. The more victims she kills, her beauty will become more eternal. Her life will become more eternal. What's wrong? I don't know. I will check the engine. -Be careful. -Yes. I will help Shakti. Yani. -Yani! -Yani! Come on. Stop! Don't do it, Yan. Do not call those demons again, okay? -We have to destroy this drum, Lidia! -No, don't! -No! Yani! -Lidia! There are four jaipong dancers... that were killed by the owner of this hairpins. Their spirits are restless. One of them... is always following... you. They will be at peace if they're buried properly. Bury them properly. I don't know... who are those missing dancers. But... according to the rumors,... there were six missing jaipong dancers. Do you know why were these cassettes in grandma's secret room? These hairpins is the tool to kill the jaipong dancers. Do you know about this hairpins? We have to go to Nyi Imas's house now. Why did you take the drum? When we came here yesterday, you weren't home. -So, we... -Why did you take the drum? -We're looking for a clue. -What clue? The mystery of the missing jaipong dancers. Get out. Why were there three hairpins inside that drum? You know it was used to kill those jaipong dancers, right? Get out! Yani! Stop! I'm sure we will find the bodies. Now I'm only asking you to stay here. Tomorrow Shakti and I will go to Aki's place. We will ask him everything. Okay? Okay? We are not in the wrong place, are we? No. Aki's house is right here. But where is his house? Excuse me. I want to ask you something. Have you ever seen a house here? -A house? -Yes. I go pass this field everyday and I never see any house. Excuse me. That's impossible. Hello, Yani. Turns out that Aki's house never existed. Did you hear that? Nothing here. But you heard that, didn't you? The sound of the wheelchair here. Shakti! Yani! Yani! Yani! Yani! Yani! Yani! Yani! Yani! Yani! Doctor, how's my best friend? She's very weak. To be honest, I've never seen a case like this before. What do you mean? We'll talk in my office. Nurse, please watch the patient. Yes, Doc. From the CT scan,... everything looks good. Nothing seems wrong in Ms. Yani's head. The whole bones look good. I don't find even a tiniest fracture. Actually, what happened to her? If we tell you,... you wouldn't believe our story. But it really happened, Doctor. What do you mean? Yani was attacked by a ghost. I was really curious about it. So, I found out myself the connection between the hairpin and the cassettes. Turns out all the answers are here in this scrapbook. Come here. So, the names of all the victims in this scrapbook... are the same with what's written on these cassettes. Here. Here. Jamilah. We have to find out what actually happened to Yani. Yes. Jamilah. Where are you going? You're still sick. Miss! You can't go anywhere. You're still under treatment. Miss! Miss! Ouch! Yani. Where are you going? -To Nyi Imas's house. -But you're still sick. I am not sick! I have to go to Nyi Imas's house now! Please don't do it. Try to understand. Let's go home. Open the room over there. The demons are gone now. Yes, Honey. Thank you. You're always there for me. Won't be long now. I will propose to you. Okay. Now will you excuse me. All right, then. I will call you later. Sorry, I didn't mean to. Sorry. This is yours. -Yes. Thank you. -You're welcome. I'm sorry. I don't understand why is this thing here? Shakti. I think Nyi Imas is around 70 years old now. But she still looks beautiful because of that ritual. Yes. But I'm still curious. She's disappeared all of a sudden. She should be arrested by the police. Mrs. Idah. Mrs. Idah. Why is the demon still there? We have buried the victims properly. The mark is still here. Aki told me there is one ghost that keeps following me. Maybe there is another victim left. Because if not, the demon won't show up anymore. I'm sure we can find some clues here. There's nothing here. Jamilah. Saroh. Uut. Dalipah. There is still one more victim. There should be one more video cassette as well. -Hey, morning, Darling. -Morning, Darling. -Nothing happened, right? -Yes. All is okay. I'll make you some coffee. I want to make something special for you because you are my future husband. Okay? Please wait. Mrs. Idah! Mrs. Idah! Mrs. Idah! Mrs. Idah! Mrs. Idah! Mrs. Idah... This is Mrs. Mirna, the one I told you about yesterday. Okay. You must be Shakti. And you're Yani. Your mother is still around here. There's no way that my mom is here. Her spirit is still wandering around. My mom was killed too? There's an evil power in this room. This is my grandma's room. That evil power is the murderer of those jaipong dancers. What do you mean? Are you accusing my grandma as the murderer? Get out of here now. I don't want to hear you accusing my grandma as the murderer! -Yani. -Get out! But I can see the evil power in this room. And I also sense that your mom's spirit is still in this house. My grandma wouldn't kill my mom! Get out of here! Darling, please. -Relax. -I just want you to know, Yani. One of those victims is targeting on you. I don't want her here. I want her to leave from here, Shakti! I'll walk you out. My grandma is not the killer. Nyi Imas did it. Believe me. Yes, Darling. Where are you going? I'm going to make some coffee. This is the fifth victim. So... So, Nyi Imas was dead all along? So, who was the woman that we saw yesterday? So, it's grandma who did it. Grandma killed those jaipong dancers! This will be our secret. Don't let anyone know... that I was the one who killed those jaipong dancers. But it's impossible. Impossible. You can't run away from me. -Because you helped me killed them. -Impossible, Shakt. You understand? You have to eat, Darling. I'll make you soup, okay? Yani? Yani! We have to find Nyi Imas's body. We have to bury her properly. Only then I can be free form that demon. Are you giving up? Yani! Yani! Open the door! Do not disturb Yani! Yani! Yani! Yani! Where is Yani now? -In her room. -Okay. She might be beyond help. What's wrong with her? Look at that mirror. She's been possessed by an evil spirit. The string that tangles her will get tighter by the minute. It can kill her. Please save her. Please. I will try. Leave this room now. How is it? I've communicated with the spirit. I asked her to untie the string that tangles Syurkiani's body. But the demon threatened to kill her. The demon holds a grudge against Syurkiani... because Syurkiani is the only remaining descendant of the murderer. The only way to save her is to go to that old house. Find the dead body that's hidden there and stab this hairpin into the body. You don't have a lot of time. Starting from tonight, until the sunrise. And if you fail, Syurkiani will die. Every five years,... your grandma had to kill one jaipong dancer. If not,... your grandma would die. Because your grandma made an agreement with the devil. Five years ago,... your grandma had to kill one jaipong dancer again. But the jaipong dancers here and in the neighboring village... were all gone. Your mother was the only one left. Where's my mom's body? She's somewhere near here. In the room... that was very well protected by your grandma. You will come to see me perform, right? I've booked you a seat. I'm sure I will dance better than yesterday. My costume is also different. -I have to find my mom's body. -Yani. Calm down please. I have to find my mom! Mom! -Yani, calm down. -I have to find my mom! -Lidia, I have to find my mom! -Yes. Calm down, okay? Mom! It's gone now. Darling, this is all because of you. I want to propose to you, Yani. Welcome. Go ahead. Go ahead. Welcome. Two tickets. Here you go.
