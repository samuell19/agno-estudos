What happened? PONTINE MARSHES JULY 5, 1902 {\ an5} The Goretti! What's wrong? Grab a blanket, too Come on! It was him! Murderer! Murderer! Kill him! Stop! The prisoner is now in the hands of justice! Move away! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! Careful! Make way! Maria! Maria! Let us through! You wretch! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! To death! Go! Go! Mom... I didn't give up. He's killed me. Come on, let's put her on her side. These are also bad wounds in the back. Doctor, is it very serious? We must operate her! She has been stabbed everywhere, .. ... at least 12 times. But that's not the worst thing. No, You can't come. In your daughter's condition.. we will not be able to use anesthetics. her heart wouldn't take it. You know what that means Be quiet. Calm! Maria! Doctor, how is Maria? I did my best. She has to get some rest now. Mom My darling I'm fine, now. My brothers? They are fine. They are all at home. Unfortunately She came round during the operation. and was awake until the end. I am thirsty. Can I have some water? No liquids, I'm sorry. We can only... ...wait. Maria? She's in there, Father. Come with me, for the child's sake. It would be a miracle if your daughter managed to rest a little. she must at least try to recover her strength. Not you, Father. Stay. Let's hope that the child... That the child can survive it. Maria! Murdering a child like that...! How can it come to that? PONTINE MARSHES TWO YEARS EARLIER Stop! Stop! This is for you. Thank you! No, get up! I'm happy to help. What is happening? What happened to you? You move away, Father! That's a thief! It's already the third time he tries to steal, down at the farm. So? What do you intend to do? Just execute him like that, on two feet? Do not make me repeat it. We have orders to take him back to the master. He will tell us what to do. That's enough! Leave him alone. Let us at least see his face, .. or the master will take it out on us. I said to leave him alone. Who are you? I've never seen you in church. Where are you from? I'm going to Neptune to take up my new job. I think we'll meet again soon. Let's go! Leave him alone, The master can deal with it. Take! Nothing happened. Goodbye. Thank goodness I came today to .. ... bring some comfort to these women. Now. Keep calm! No more danger! It is not fear. he's got malaria. I've seen you before. You're one of the seasonal workers. Madam, I beg you, don't send me away! I can't stay without a job! My children are hungry and without the pay we can't make it. You have my word. Now you have to treat yourself. No! I'm fine! I can do it! I'm fine! Most of the farmers who work here .. ... sooner or later will catch malaria. And who is the master of these lands? If you want to know Conte Mazzoleni, .. ... after lunch you always find him at home. My name is Elena Mazzoleni. I'm his wife. Thank you. Malaria! Once you've got it, you never get rid of it. But how is it possible Nothing can be done? In short, the man I met today has to die just like that? Malaria can only be prevented, with quinine. But the quinine is expensive! And how do they pay for it, the farmers? What kind of man is the master who drives the farmers to hunger .. ... and let them be destroyed by malaria? Even in the Catechism it is written that oppressing the poor. ... and not giving the right reward to the workers .. These are among the worst sins that a man can do! They are sins that cry out for vengeance before God. We can help these workers .. ... only by supporting them with the power of faith to the Lord. Tomorrow morning, first thing .. I'd recommend taking a look at Campomorto. It is it's there at Conca that we need more help for the functions. There are two small chapels ... and they're usually only open in summer. And are they far? It will be six kilometers. If you want, you can take my buggy .. ... or there is a shortcut through the swamp. Father! Are you lost? Come with me. Thank you. We have arrived, Father. Thank you. Goodbye, Father! Goodbye! We kill ourselves with work .. ... and he steals everything! He swore that if we do 400 quintals of harvest, .. ... will sign us a real contract. And then he asks us only a third of the harvest, .. ... which is less than what we paid before! Eh, a third... Only the tools and seeds we have to buy from him .. with debts! then we have to sell it to him... ... at the price that says his lordship, the Count! look...They work the same land.. they share the same house and fight each other like two dogs! and they think they're partners? Shut your mouth and get to work, partner! Here's Maria! It's time to eat! always on time like a clock. That's enough, thanks. Maria... Maria... He won't make it to the summer. I want to know where you got that call! Let's eat! Give me that! Oh, Sarde '! But how does that little girl do it? Maria never stops! Of course! Not like someone I know! Damn...! you always reproach me! Don't forget your son. Half man... half a ration! Take! Marietta, can we make 400 quintals? We'll make it! You can say it louder! We'll make it! We'll make it! The Body of Christ. Amen. The Body of Christ. Amen. The Body of Christ. Amen. The Body of Christ. Amen. The Body of Christ. Amen. But you still here? Come on, clear the table! May I? Father... Are you the family that lives with the Serenelli, in Cascina Antica? Yes, it's a nice big farmhouse. large enough for two families. After all, Giovanni Serenelli has only got his son now. I've seen the swamp. It must be hard work to tiring there. Yes. And then the owner isn't very easy to please either. However, you only have to dry out the land. ... and be able to plow it. Then you can grow fresh beans for fodder and wheat... Then you realize the gift God has given us. I'm Luigi Goretti. We're not from here. We come from outside. These are my sons. Angelo, Ersilia, Sandrino and Mariano. This is Assunta, my wife. She holds little Teresa, the last one in her arms. Ah, but That leaves... Here she is. She is Maria. Good morning! Good morning, Father! Take the dogs there. Make them eat. Good morning. Is the Count free? Yes, come. I'll show you the way. Father Basilio is here, the new Priest. They told me that you'd arrived a few days ago. So, How are you doing here at Conca? I'm not used to it yet. But I saw that they are all good people, good people.. ... including that poor man that your men tried to kill. They wanted only to give him a lesson. We are not murderers around here. However,They're rabble worse than animals. And then, when they steal, they must be punished. That man was also severely weakened by malaria. Even the newspapers, today, they talk about malaria. According to our political class.. ... now we should pay for the quinine out of our pockets. But how much it would cost us they do not write it. Three lire. Every year, a worker, wife and relatives included. Three pounds if they are enough! Three lire... But that would serve to save lives. Human lives. They say that we landowners are parasites.. ... that we eat the rent and do not invest in the property. They treat us less than the city's industrialists, " ... as if the money for taxes did not have the same value. That really makes me angry! You're a priest... isn't there anything that makes you angry? The exploitation of man on man .. ... from speculators .. ... who, for their income, abuse people .. ... and treat them as if they were things. All we needed was a socialist priest. These are the words of His Holiness, Leo XIII. He wrote them in the Encyclical "Rerum Novarum". I am too busy to keep up with the Pope's moods. Here... These are the candles for the little church of Campomorto. Thank you very much. And also for the other day. - As for my husband... - No. Do not worry. your husband is a straightforward man .. ... and the straightforward people .. ... make the world easier. Good night. Good night. We thank you, Lord, for the food you have given us. Go to bed now! All right, dad. Good night, dad! Good night. I'm tired too, tonight. Very tired. One to say good night, one to make you sleep .. ... and one to make you dream. Goodnight, little butterfly. Come here, you! Come here! So! Do not be late. I have to do some darning. Good night! The Priest, today, when he saw you, he seemed to have seen... ...a ghost. I met him the other day on the canal. He was lost. You should have seen his face! What's up? Your father's already creaking like a funeral carriage I'm tired... I can't take anymore. That's enough for tonight. Good night. Don't be late It gets light early these days. What's this? Have you already read it? One day I will leave here forever. I don;t want to stay here and finish like my father. Are you afraid of death? I don't know. I'm just afraid of dying without doing .. not even one thing... What? I don't know. Something that... I don't know. Lord, please, let us all be happy. Never let us stop dreaming .. ... and hoping. Amen. Last night you fell asleep like a cooked pear! Good morning! Good morning! I'll bring it to you. Thank you. I have to hurry up. I have to go shopping. Good morning! The usual! Flour, salt, .. ... cotton and brown buttons, please! Here it is... So, it's 3... 5... 1 and medium, 2, 2 and medium... 14. The flour is increased, eh? But this is that of the other week! No, it's not the same. They brought it to me yesterday .. and I paid more for it. That's 14. It's the same number On the bag that I saw last week. You can't read. I can recognize numbers... ... even if I can't read. I told you it has increased. Not this one! The bill is 12 and 5. All right... Yes. 12 and 5, all right. Good day! I would like to have the same confidence. She's a Goretti. More tough than a drunken man. The count is here! The count is here! 400 quintals of harvest...! And you believe that, he'll sign that contract? He also did it with Sardinia! He did it with everyone! He treats us like donkeys, like "pacifiers"! He shows us the carrot then breaks our backs! And then this is your chance! The last time you convinced me to discuss an agreement .. ... they threw us into the street. Oh really? If you don't have the guts to defend your rights .. that means I've chosen the wrong partner! It is with work that we defend our rights. Only with work. Did he say 400 quintals? 400 quintals will be. And He'll have to sign the new contract. I feel sorry for you, and your family of beggars! Get to work! Maria! Don't be sad. It is a kind of disease. It is not his fault. Like the fever? Yes, like a fever. The worst of all. Is it something... like malaria? Worse. It's a disease called hatred .. ... and The only cure possible for that .. ... is Jesus. However, Maria, you don't have to worry. When you do First Communion, Jesus will always be with you. Go away... Go away. Trust in Jesus. Ask him for help and the fever will go away. What do you want? Leave me alone! Go to your father. It's nothing... I just need to sleep. To sleep... Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with You. You are blessed among women .. ... and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners .. ... now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with You. You are blessed among women .. ... and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God... I bet.. ... that even the Count and his wife look at the sky, at night, .. ... and feel closer to God. How beautiful the sky is, mother. ♪ Genoveffa goes to the market ♪ ♪ and the laundry is also worn. ♪ ♪ Genoveffa goes into... ♪ Did you hear something? Father! Mother! Maria, What's the matter? Maria! Eternal rest give them, O Lord, .. ... and the Perpetual Light shine upon them. Rest in peace. Amen. Go. The Mass is over. And with your spirit. I found him. Will I do it soon, My First Communion? Sure. As soon as you have the right age. With him, this year, 17 people have already died on the fields. Does the count want the malaria to kill us one by one? When will you pay off your debts for the seeds? We made a deal and it was you who proposed it, .. ... but it seems that you can't respect it. Now respect at least the dead. He's the one who should die Like a dog! Mom, are we going into town? Yes, for the party! There will be a lot of people! The party! Yes, the party! Yes, we will go there! See, Maria? Water is not bad. Not even that of the swamp, .. ... if we look at it with the eyes of hope .. ... and faith. Dad! Mom! I love you! I want you too! I love you too! Me too, mom! And I love you too! I love you. Do you know horses are crazy? Grass! It's like a drug to them! Cowherding is a great job You're paid twice as much for riding from morning to night! Sooner or later I can do it! I will go to the Count and ask him. I'm sure he'll say yes Then, When I have enough money. ... I will take the ship and go to America. There are all rich .. ... and they do what they want! There's target shooting! Maria! This is for whom do we do it? For the Captain in second! YUP! And this for whom do we do it? For Admiral! For Admiral! Yup! So! So,my dears? Nobody wants to play with me? Of course! even you, omettino? How beautiful...! Not even you, omettino? Are you going for a ride? Come on, we'll pay for it! You don't play for free. You pay, eh? Of course, don't worry! Always if you can convince him! she's a woman that you can't see even in your dreams! You leave it to me! Come here, you! so? Do you have the idea of where it starts? Little man! Where are you going? Done! Done! It was fast, but it went well. Yes, it was fast! Fast like a rabbit! Dad, are you sick? Luigi, what's wrong? Dad! It's just a dizziness. It's nothing, little butterfly. Help me! Help! Hen! Let's go home... Let's go home... Here we go! Walk! Where is he? Where is he? Can you hear anything? You can cover yourself. But yes... It must have been all that crowd down at the party. It's not true? Is that it? My Madonna, please! I understand that you must earn your bread, doctor, .. ... but do not do it on my shoulders. I'm very fine. You look like a blind man on the edge of the ravine. What do I have? When I go back to Conca, .. ... next week, I want to find you in bed. And I'm not kidding. He too...has caught malaria Oh, no...! I'm sorry. Help me, Lord. Dad... Dad! Assunta! The belt has been broken! I'm going to see if I can find another one. Go with your father. Yup. True and! It's up to the owner to stop us from dying! In other places, the free quinine is already given! If you all agree, why don't you do what they did in the North? Striking is not a sin! No, I will not do strike for quinine. It is bitter as death. And do you know why? But if they also give it to the stubborn and ignorant ones... They say it's the devil's medicine! We will not do a strike! I say we have to break it inside! We have to hit him in what he has most dear, his stuff! He's right! Let's burn the warehouses, let's kill the dogs! No! One every day, until he comes here .. to beg us to stop it! You are exceeding the limit. Mazzoleni is the killer! He killed him with his hands, That poor wretch man we buried. It's what rages you inside that will end up killing you. You will see who will die! Dad! Anyway, if you agree for a strike, that's fine with me. Father Basilio is right. We must defend our rights. But nothing more. Come on...! Nothing happened! Let's go! What's your name? Primo! So you're Primo,you shouldn't be the last to get up, right? You are Primo! That's crazy! It's crazy, yes! There was little lack! Mom! Maria! Do not worry, nothing happened. No! It's hate! Hate, you know.. ... Catch you like malaria and never leaves you! Count! Father Basilio has arrived! Here is your liqueur, Count. Father! At this timeyou should be saying Mass, or What I know that you... Reassemble the church. It's about the last malaria victim. I canceled his debts. What else does the family want? Distribute that blessed quinine.. ... otherwise people will continue to die, like the animals at the slaughterhouse. I've already told you that it'll cost me at least 3 lire per year, per head. I can not afford it. You don't know what might happen! What? A strike? They'll burn the barns, kill my Dogs? What will they do? No, do not worry. Nothing of this will happen. We're all too busy trying to... survive here. We are? You do not even know what "survive" means. Maria! Maria! The animals! They escaped! They will drown in the swamp! And Zipolo? Even Zipolo has escaped! But where are you going? You must stay in bed! It's not the strike! What happened? It seems the channel has become obstructed! Where? Behind the big curve! It's where we are! This land is also ours .. and the mud will eat it all! This land is Mazzoleni! If it goes down the drain, worse for him and worse for us all! Father! Dad, I'm coming too! Go inside with your brothers! Come here! Give me your hand! Come on! Let's go in! Come on, come on! Leave me! Come on! What the hell are you doing here in the rain? My duty, likeyou! Get in! May I? Where's Luigi? He went to the fields! There was nothing to do! Your husband is crazy! It's dangerous in his condition! We must find him right away. Let's go and call the others. Father, I'm coming with you! I'll come with you! Come on, Maria, please! It's dangerous! Stay at home! No, please! I beg you! Father, hurry up! Always stay beside me. Yes, Father! Dad! Luigi! Goretti! Dad! Luigi! Dad! Dad! Here he is, he's over there! Dad! Yes, Right! Let's go! Quick! Dad! He managed to unlock the channel! Dad! Dad! Well, doctor? He doesn't have much time. Maria .. ..I want you to have this cross. And I want you to celebrate First Communion as soon as possible. Yes. So, when I .. .. have to entrustmyself to the Lord.. He will already know you, by name and surname .. ... and will also treat me well. The Lord will say: .. ... "Now it's him .. ... the father of my Marietta! ". Call your mother. Assunta... We won't be able .. ... to make 400 quintals. You have to leave here. You have to go back to the village. Promise me! Promise me! No more visits. The children. shouldn't see their father.. .. dies like that. I'll handle that. It's better if you leave, Maria. No! If he'd taken the quinine, This would never have happened. It takes endless patience .. ... to pray for things to change. Assunta .. Maybe Luigi was right. Dad...! It is better if you return to your country. Our work and our home are here, .. Where the Lord has brought us. This is where we will stay, with God's help. Mom will continue to work the fields .. ... and I'll look after my brothers. You have the same strength as your father. Now,". ...he.. ... is always with me. Zipolo! Come here! "Astro del Ciel, pargol divin"... So, are we all here? Cascio, Have you brought the book or brought the dog again? Yes, yes, I've brought it this time. Good! Today we will talk about the Passion of Christ. Does anyone know what the Passion of Christ is? I! I! I! You! It's when they killed him. Good boy! You? Yes, when they nailed him on the cross. Good! And why did they nailed him on the cross? Why? Mrs! No, even fruit! But you already hosts catechism at your home! You are spoiling them! Did I already told you that you are saint? Come on, children, come over her. Easy now! Fruit does not run away! Can I have a banana? Are you Maria? you.. ...You know me? Sure. You are a sensitive child .. and also very brave. No... No, you're wrong! Trust me. I can recognize courage and fortitude when I see them. Maybe.. ... because I don't have enough. Now come here, and sit down over here. So, we were talking about the crucifixion. But why the Romans were so afraid of Jesus, .. why they wanted so much to kill him? Because he did miracles. Because they hated him. Yes, of course, they hated him, .. but why? Because he was a Jew. The King of the Jews. he scared them. He was an enemy. Yes. He preached about another Kingdom, more powerful than Rome. A Kingdom of equality and love. the Kingdom of God. But they hated him and were so afraid of him. Also because he said that we are... All brothers. Yes. That we are all the same, in the eyes of God the Father, .. and that hating others .. ... it's like hating yourself. Basilio! Don Temistocle! Finally I see you're happy! What is in the news paper ? the news in the newspapers. The law has been passed! Which law? The one that obliges .. the landowners to distribute the quinine for free. They understood that this massacre could not continue! What does the count Mazzoleni do with the law? Are you sure that he will accept it, without saying a word? He Will accept. Ah, he will accept! why? Because I'll be there with... the guards! Next! Hold on! Sign here. But... the same spoon? He was shaking like a leaf yesterday! Swallow it and get out! But... Malaria is not contagious. Doctor, are you sure? Whether you like it or not, now you have to take quinine by law. At my expense, just to change. Do you like it? It's good! I got it for you. That's why you gathered all that grass! Maria, give me a little! Come on, come on! Leg! Stick! If it hurts his pockets, it means that it is certainly good for us. Good morning. Good morning. Do not be afraid. It's a bit bitter, but it's good for you. He knows how to be loved by everyone. Hold on! she is without defenses. She doesn't know what harm they could cause her. He's greedy! Don't Give him much. Your father? He stayed at home. He says I can manage without him. he's tired. We must understand him. He does not feel good. And Me? Does anyone worry about understanding me? Maria has darned these shirts. Now that we are both alone... I've never been alone. Hey, well then? I'm eating! You eat a lot in Sardinia? Let's go come on! Forza! The lunch is over! Let's move! The land does not wait for us! What happens? Where are you going? You have to finish the day! And who are you? The Count's daughter? This year we can make it to respect the agreements! We succeed! Who cares! it's only the owner who gains the money Alessandro, what's happening to you? What is happenning that now I have to pull the cart by myself .. ... and I've got the boxes full splitting my back .. ... for something that is not mine either. and I don't have to answer to you! You said once that you don't want to be like your father. I'm not like him! Now I also know what hatred is, .. ... because this land disgusts me, the swamp makes me sick! This life is sucks! Now, I beg you! Hatred will kill you inside, it will destroy your life! No, it will change it instead. Because I hate my father! With all my might! And I don't want to be cured! Careful with those coffins! I'll make you pay for them out of your pocket, eh? Forza! Forza! Come on! How many are they? One, two, three, four... And you? Where do you think you are going? I must speak to the master. I want... I'd like to work with the horses. Then take a seat. The owner was looking for .. ... just some Marche replacements like you. I said be careful, you fools! Be quiet! These marchigiani always complain and then they die like flies! The malaria takes them away to quintals. Continue, you! I have... some unfinished business to see to. Yes? I was just going to count the eggs in the barn. And what are you doing? Do you want to take a ride with Giuseppa with him? Quick with these coffins! Let's go! Hi Dad! Mom told me to say hello. Teresa always asks me.. How you look like? ... I jokingly told her that you were tall.. ... Handsome and strong like an ox! I'm sorry? I always show her the photos, .. ... but it is not clear. Truely you were better in the real life. Tall, handsome and strong. this Sunday I'll celebrate the Communion! Now that you're gone, I need all the help of God. I hope to be worthy of it. I know he will give it to me. Good bye! - Maria! - Oh God...! You almost got me a shock! Why? Are you scared, now? Maria, you love me, don't you? Sure! why? What did you think? What are you doing? Prove it. Did they give you a job as a cowherd? Come with me! Stop! Leave me! Shut up! Leave me! It's a long time since we didn't see you at the table? Did you and your father decide not to eat? This darning is disgusting, Maria! If you don't want to do it, don't do it. I can't wear it anymore. I'll try to repair it again, okay? Accompany me to the swamp. I'm curious, this year, to know .. ... how the young ladies are wearing their little hats . Fashion! Why? I was only joking! You are really a poor guy! And why? Nothing, Sarde ', you're not a poor guy. You're an animal! And why? ♪ Genoveffa goes to the market ♪ ♪ and you also bring laundry ♪ ♪ Genoveffa goes to the countryside ♪ ♪ and the wolf ♪ ... if he eats it. Good morning! Hi, Pippo! How are you? And you? Eh? Isodoro! What a beautiful coat! Zipolo! You grow bigger every day! Well... See you later, eh? Hello! You didn't answer me. What? You didn't tell me if you love me. You didn't show it to me. Please, Alessandro We're friends. Don't ruin everything! Don't stain your soul! Please! Let's just be friends! No! Stop! No! Please! It's a terrible sin! God will punish you! No! No! No! Maria! Maria! Where did that girl go? Yet they told me she was here! Maria, here you are! I was trying to tell you that I'm going to the market. You should look after the children! But why do you run away? Maria! Maria! Maria, what is it? Maria, what happened? Nothing. Nothing happened. If you tell someone, I'll kill you. Did you understand? Shut up! Shut up! I said I'll kill you! Hello, Father! Doctor... What's up? The agreements with Mazzoleni have become harder.. ... we decided not to respect them. And the Count? The doctor says... ... He, in vengeance, stopped giving us the quinine. He knows that the guards won't come back. He can no longer do his own thing and stand against the law. Give him a nice complaint and you will see that the request will pass. It is your right! If you don't do it, then I will. Mom, it's time! Come on, go! This morning, you get the First Communion! Come on... young lady! Leave that, I'll do it later. Have you ever seen a girl like her? Did Mrs.Albertini lend us the veil? Yes! Go on! Here it is... Mom, can I help you? Not today. But you don't eat today, Maria? You don't eat before communion. It's no problem. I swear! It's no problem at all. and... I do not know if I'll want to eat. We could borrow new shoes for me too, right? Jesus looks at your heart, not at your feet. ♪ Giro, round dance ♪ ♪ .. the world is born... ♪ This is sent to you by the landowner's wife in person. So, young lady, are you ready for the big day? At least for once, you don't have to go on foot. Let's go! The body of christ. Amen. The body of christi. Amen. The body of christ. Amen. The body of christ. Amen. I beg your pardon if I have cooked badly, sometimes. I'll try to improve. I ask you for forgiveness .. ... if, sometimes, I couldn't take care of the children .. and I left them to you. What are you saying, my love? We are... who should apologize to you,... You're so young, for what you can do. I have to ask forgiveness for you too... ... for mismating your shirts. For not understanding you, sometimes. You are so Beautiful! If only he could see you your father...! You already look like a bride. When the right husband comes, I will not recognize him. It will be God who will recognize him to me. And I will love him for life, like you and dad. Thanks for coming. These occasions are more beautiful, .. ... if everyone is celebrating together. Good morning, twins! Truly, Father, we have cometo say goodbyer. We're leaving Conca.because We could not do what the Count wanted He said that he decides when the terms are no longer valid. He can't just kick you out. He did it, Father. He didn't think twice about it and he did it. I reported him for quinine and then he took his revenge. No, Father, it's not your fault. He would have done the same any way. Let's go down to our country. They need farmhands theres. Goodbye. Goodbye, Father. All clear! Be careful not to hurt yourself! Come on, guys! Quick! He does not want to stop! Move! Mr. Count! Those people have children to feed! If you want to revenge, do it with me! You can report me again! I don't have time for subversive priests! I had made a deal with them and they could not keep it, ... these aren't the things that concern me! Sooner or later you will have to deal with Divine Justice .. ... and you're wrong if you think this story .. ... can be stored like that, as if nothing had happened! Since you arrived, .. ... I can't do anything as if nothing had happened! I do not care about your complaints, but if you'ren't capable of .. ... to stay good and be a priest as God commands, .. ...This means that this is not the place for you. Hey! Where have you been? Did you go to see womens? Do you think that you eat air in this house? If you really want to know, in a little time I'll join the millitary. Last week I had visited them and they took me. Oh Really? Why aren't you... like all the other children? Why aren't you like Maria? I was hoping that .. you would do the blessing of the fields Basilio .. for the autumn. You know, for these people... Today I almost invested Count Mazzoleni. The Priest should be stronger than other men, .. instead I have discovered that I am not. I no longer have love inside of me. And this land no longer has any light in my eyes. That child is right. Hatred is like malaria. If you let it in... it does not leave you anymore.
