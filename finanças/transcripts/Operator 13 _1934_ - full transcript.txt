Just imagine. The second disaster in the same place. Why don't Abe Lincoln do something? 'The Pauline Cushman players. Ford's theatre. Washington DC'. 'Special performance. Mr Henry Gregg'. 'Miss Amanda Legrand'. 'Mr J. Wilkes Booth. Miss Gail Loveless'. 'Tonight'. Good evening, boys. I will sing you a song about a colonel and a major and a captain and a private. And little Sally Brown. Her name is Loveless. Gail Loveless. You must have seen her. Played in Washington all last winter. There once was a colonel, a high-minded colonel. And the colonel fell in love with little Sally Brown. But pretty little Sally said I got no time to dally. I got an appointment in town. Then the colonel met the major and the major made a wager. That he was just the type of soldier to appeal to Sally Brown. And pretty little Sally said I got no time to dally. I got an appointment in town. Then the captain came along. And he said to the major, you are wrong. Watch my technique. But he very soon discovered it was terribly weak. Then the colonel and the major and the captain followed Sally. To see where she was going, and you should have heard the groans. As they discovered Sally strolling from the ballet on the arm of private Jones. Then the colonel and the captain and the major followed Sally. As they discovered Sally strolling from the ballet on the arm of private Jones. She seems much younger than I thought from your description. This is hardly the work for a feeble old woman. I know this girl well. We played at Ford's together for a year. Lived in the same house. Shared the same dressing room. I can vouch for her. Come in. Pauline. Pauline Cushman. I am so glad. - How are you, my dear? I thought you were still in England. What in the world are you doing here? - Major Allen sent for you. To explain. Miss Loveless - Major Allen. - Miss Loveless. I saw your performance tonight. Very generous and thoughtful of you to come here and entertain. Gail. Anything you may hear in this room is in the strictest confidence. A military secret. Do you understand? Major Allen is really Major Allen Pinkerton. General McClellan's chief of the secret service. And Miss Cushman is one of our best operatives. Operatives? Call them what a court martial calls them if they're unlucky and get caught. Spies. So you see. I haven't been in England at all. I've lived here and there south of the Mason Dixon line as .. Mrs Mary Vain. A widow. The most devoted and loyal confederate of them all. I had no idea. Miss Cushman is in Washington on 24 hours leave. Tomorrow she reports back to my headquarters in Virginia. How would you like to report with her? Me? I needn't say, you may never come back. Your family? - I haven't a soul. My brother died at the battle of Shiloh. Do you think I could? Do you think I am .. man enough? I will take a chance. Let me see. We will make you. Number 13. Thirteen? That is George Madden's number. It was George Madden's number. But since sunrise yesterday Number Thirteen has belonged to no-one. Report for instructions tomorrow. Operator 13. Goodnight. Whoa, Bedelia. Whoa. Wait. I thought this was Major Allen's HQ. - It is, ain't it. I know, but what are them Calicos doing up there? Hey, Gus. We've met another disaster. We've been trapped into a tea party. You're mistaken. Ain't you heard Allen sometimes uses women to .. I heard. I also hear we'll win a battle someday. It ain't the truth, is it? Gus. You go in. I'll go in later. I'll get some ribbon to tie in my hair. Whoa, Bedelia. Come in. Captain Hitchcock and Lieutenant Littledale report as ordered. Gentlemen, you are just in time. I have special orders for you. Rather difficult. I must get two operators past Stuart's lines and into Martinsburg tonight. One to get in from the south as if coming from New Orleans. The other from the north. Can you do it? I imagine, Major. But if we got to get men on and off trains .. Operators 27 and 13 are not men. They are not men? What are they, mules? - No such luck. Price, will you kindly see if Miss Cushman is ready. Excuse my ignorance, Major. What's next, a pillow fight? Hitchcock, that will do. Very well, Major Allen. We're all ready. Good morning, Miss Cushman. Good morning, Major Allen. Sorry to hurry you. - Quite alright. We're all ready. That is very good. Excellent. Excellent. This gentlemen, Captain Hitchcock, will take you through the lines. Lieutenant Littledale will act as contact. Then we can be starting, Major? - Immediately. Lucille, hurry up. Yes, ma'am. I'm coming. I packed everything for you. You're not taking a maid? Yes. Why not? Negroes are always gossiping. I cannot allow it. Where is Miss Loveless? Miss Loveless? She done had an accident. Yes, sir. She turned colored. Just like me. How do you do, Major Allen? I knew it all the time. Do you think I will do, Major? - Decidedly. Listen. I'm sending you through General Jeb Stuart's lines at Martinsburg. Stuart is the firebrand of the south. No-one ever knows just where he'll strike next. It is up to you to find out. How, is your business. Is that clear? - Very clear, Major. Operator 13? Operator 27 will tell you that the chief duty of the spy .. Is not to get caught. That rather puts an end to your usefulness, doesn't it. Company. Attention! All present and accounted for. All present and accounted for, sir. It's a mighty pretty flag. Sort-of pretty looking with its stars and bars. I'll tell you when it's going to look elegant. When we hoist it over the capitol in Washington. When y'all reckon we is going to do that? I ain't exactly settled the date. Being General Stuart's orderly like you is. I suspect you already know the date. I ain't at liberty to say. You sure got something military about you, Lucille. Yeah. Now don't let him fool you. He don't know. Who knows? - You. Why ain't you heard? Jeb Stuart and Jeff Davis himself ask Mr Sweeney's advice. Before they blow their noses. Blow their noses, eh? Look here, you little .. Just for that I'm going to put you across my knee. Yes I am. Behave yourself. What is the matter? White folk investigating you? If you want to have a good time join the cavalry. Join the cavalry. Join the cavalry. Whatever you was doing it was mighty fine for white folks. But not for yourself, colored gal. She ain't colored. Ain't you noticed? She's probably got as much white blood as you have. More, most likely. My kinfolks come from Martinique. I am rich, I is. I said I travelled with a show. From New Orleans. - A show? That snake doctor that came through here a week ago? That's a show, ain't it? A show? Ha-ha. I thought you was talking about a shoe. I trust you being an actor .. Ain't keeping you from busting loose to get Miss Vail's laundry done on time. I got to apologise, Mr Rufus. I'm just a shade behind-handed. Behind handed or before handed? You'd best look out. Miss Vail is partying tonight. If them clothes ain't there for seven. Some other laundry gal is going to have the esteemed honor .. Of doing her laundry in the by and by. Ain't he uppity. In case I ever gets hold of one of his personal shirts. I'll starch the tails so he can't sit down. What you doing tonight, Lucille? The general is going to the big dance and I got a bottle of corn whiskey. None of you appears to care nothing about nothing but courting and drinking. Ain't you ever going to do any fighting? Ain't you ever going to ride any place? Never mind that. Just bring a big basket of clothes like it's the general's order. That will get you right in. Will you, Lucille? - I might. Look out! Master. Soldier man. Don't you never mind that I slaved over them clean clothes all day? Confound it. I might have run over you. I'd just as soon be trampled on as to wash them again. I am sorry. How far is it to General Stuart's headquarters? Half a mile. Straight ahead. Say. You are a stranger here, ain't you? I'll bet you come from general headquarters at Richmond. And I'll bet you are a nosy little so-and-so. Yes, sir. My name is Lucille. In case you got any laundry you want done, I is right here. Alright, Lucille. I'll remember. Your horse looks kinda droopy. You've come a long way, ain't you? You know, Lucille. Someday that snoopy little nose of yours is going to lead you right into trouble. No, sir. But if it do. These two feet of mine is going to get me right out. Officers called. Officers called. [ Bugle call ] At rest, gentlemen. Gentlemen, Captain Gailliard. He's just returned from a trip into the heart of the enemy country. He spent several weeks in New York. Last night he passed through Washington. At daybreak he contacted a patrol of our troops at the risk of his life. He changed his clothing and arrived here an hour ago. Completing a signal feat of heroism. Which I think deserves a tribute from all of us. Captain Gailliard, sir. Captain Gailliard brings us startling news. Washington is in a panic. They even take up the boards on the long bridge across the Potomac every night. For fear our armies will march across if before morning. The north is torn by dissension. Lincoln is openly assailed in the streets. The army is on the verge of rout. Gentlemen. Before a quick determined attack, the capital of the union would fall. General Stuart, we've been steadily on the offensive for weeks. Our troops are exhausted. We have no reserves. Our artillery? Well, it's impossible. Yes. I know. Impossible. But the south expects the impossible from us. Colonel Storm. My heavy guns are at Fairview, sir. They couldn't move rapidly anyway. The six field batteries are at Brown's Ferry, dismantled. We estimate four days for a complete overhaul. Colonel Storm. How soon can you get those guns rolling again? By midnight, sir. Issue orders for a general advance at daybreak. Hold everything in readiness. General Storm, we await your assurance. That you are able to come to our support at the Potomac crossing. That is all. Channing, Captain Gailliard. One moment. You two men should know each other. Captain Gailliard, this is Captain Cornelius Channing. Chief of my secret service. Captain Gailliard has the same position with the general staff at Richmond. You two good spies should know each other. I bow to the master, sir. - Thank you, sir. What you doing standing here, brown-skin? I was just looking at the lace. It's pretty, ain't it. Don't you know Miss Vail is waiting for them clothes for the ball tonight? I must go now. I just wanted to explain. Explain? - Yes. Give me them clothes. - No. I got to take them to master. - I'll take them. Then you take the basket. I'll take the panties. - I'll take them myself. Then tell Miss Vail there's something wrong the waistband on her panties. Alright. I will tell her. - Them is hanging by a thread. Look out you don't ruin them panties. That's the position and it must be met. But the Yankees know our plans almost as soon as we do. Nothing serious as yet. Patrols ambushed. Couriers captured. Positions shelled too often to be mere chance. There is a spy in Martinsburg. No doubt of it. And if we were to start our general advance now .. I've looked up every newcomer in this town. This Mrs Vail who took the Clegg place. From New Orleans you say? - Appears so. You're satisfied she's alright? No, sir. - What do you mean? The way things are I'm not satisfied with anybody. Least of all with myself. Here are my thoughts. There's a ball tonight at the home of Mrs Dandridge. Will you and Captain Gailliard delay your return to Richmond for a day .. And attend that ball? Sort-of lend us your aid? The spy, whoever he is, will be there. You may depend on it. It takes less reason than that to lead me to a roomful of beautiful ladies. My goodness, it's nice to dance with a really tall man. I certainly am glad you dropped in from .. Wherever it was you dropped in from. I hope you're going to stay. I hope so too. I'm planning a little ball myself for the day after tomorrow. I would like to have you come. That is, if these restless troops of ours are still here. Captain Gailliard. Couldn't you come to the rescue of a poor beleaguered hostess? And tell me whether it's reasonably safe to go on with my preparations. I don't know any reason in the world why not, Mrs Vail. You are a darling. If I was the powers that be. I'd make you a general immediately. By the way, where is General Stuart? I wonder. Halt. Who goes there? It is me. I is not going. I is coming. Kinda late, ain't it? This is the biggest and heaviest load of washing I ever did tote in my life. For the general? It sure is. My arms are almost breaking under it. Goodnight. Goodnight. Hey. These are the general's clothes. Ain't that nice. Stay here. I'll call Sweeney. Never mind. I know the right way to go. You do? - I sure do. You do, do you? I certainly does. Who was it you were talking to? - A girl bringing the general's laundry. Was it Lucille? - Yeah. Where'd she go? I don't know. She said she knew her way. - Some smart girl, that Lucille. Sweeney. Yes, sir? My hat and gloves. Sit down. Well, gentlemen. Everything's ready. We move at sunrise. Providing Colonel Storm reports that he is ready. As many of you as can .. Will proceed quietly to the dance. But don't make it apparent anything unusual is in prospect. Yes, sir. Remember. Watch your speech. Trust no-one. If Colonel Storm reports favorably. You will see this word is passed to me and to all members of the general staff. 'It will storm before morning'. You understand? Storm before morning. - Exactly. That is all, gentlemen. Oh look. There is the medicine show. The medicine show. Captain Gailliard. Do stop. I just love the medicine show. Milo. Tell them to come inside. Lucille. Y'all heading for the white folks now? Why don't you stay where you belong? Go and mind your business. Quit pestering me, big bear. 27 is here. And 13? Yep. Over by the tree. Hiya, folks. I call you 'folks'. I know you too well to call you ladies and gentlemen. Wait a minute. Wait a second. I'll get real serious with you folks. I am going to talk about my medicine. And I am going to tell you what my medicine cures. Heartburns. Rheumatism. Tapeworms. I could go on for hours and hours and hours telling you. Only my time is limited. So tonight. I am going to appear. In the public square of your beautiful town. Down yonder. And tomorrow night. I will be in Ellenville. And the night after that. I am going to appear in another beautiful town. Called Bearfield. But last but not least. I am sending among you one of my men. Step down, doctor. He is going to sell my medicine. I think. Rip Van Winkle was a man. Who taught folks how to sleep. Twenty good long years. Wrapped in slumber, he. Rip Van Winkle. What you do your best. Boy, you sure do love your rest. Sleepy head. How I love my little bed. Please go away and let me be. Can't you see I want to be .. Just nothing but a sleepy head. Sleepy head. Don't you see the sun so red? I don't like the sun no how because I am too much sunburned now. I want to be a sleepy head. All you do is keep procrastinating. I can't argue because my mind ain't clear. You ain't going to go nowhere by waiting. I don't want to go nowhere. I like it here. Sleepy head. Don't you take away my bed. There's a lot of things I love but beds is what I'm fondest of. Good old sleepy head. Medicine, lady? No thank you. Excuse me, Miss Vail. Did you get the word about the waistband on your panties? No, Lucille. That no-good Rufus. I done told him. Do you mind if I look? Excuse me, sir. Land sakes, Miss Vail. You got them very panties on now. They're liable to drop right off. With these nice-looking gentlemen around. Mercy, Lucille. If you got a minute, I'll fix 'em. - Yes, of course. Come along. That Mrs Vail asked a lot of questions. I'm having her house searched while she is out of it. Good. Did you get the orders? - Yes. I tried to tell you where we were but Rufus stopped me. You must pass them on at once. - I've got them. Now, if you can learn when the word comes .. From Colonel Storm, I'll tell you. There you are, Miss Vail. I think that holds for the evening anyhow. I certainly hope so, Lucille. General. I am afraid it will storm before morning. Good. It will storm before morning, sir. I think it will storm before morning. Did you hear that? The signal. 'The storm before morning'. Get to Hitchcock at once. Heavens, they are leaving. Run after them. Lucille, that is alright now. But I certainly hope you won't be so careless again. Where to? Where to in such a hurry? Oh, it's you. Yes, sir. Mr Captain. It's me. Work all day and run around all night, huh? There is a man pestering me. I don't know that I blame him much. Run along, little brown girl. - Yes, sir. My flower. Run along. Yes, sir. A thousand pardons, General. Yours too, madam. May I have a word with you, General? It's urgent. You military men are hopeless. Well? This Vail woman. I knew I was right. And I took my chance. My men did not search her house. They took her house apart. There was a bit of mended ceiling. It had fallen and been glued back. And behind it .. We found these. The federal pass. That's enough to hang her. Put her under arrest at once. Channing. She's not working alone. Who is taking her information through the federal lines? Someone very shrewd? And probably .. Quite innocent. Yes. Quite innocent. The start is to be made at sunrise. Storm's batteries will come at the Potomac crossing. This is a copy of general orders for Harper's brigade. It's only partial but it's the best I could do. The best? It's marvelous. We've got to get it through. There she is. Right over there. See? Hey, you. The colored gal. Come here. Let go of my arm. Come on. Mr Doctor. You tell them. You tell them that I is a decent colored girl. I ain't done nothing and I ain't going to do nothing. What does he want me for? - Now, stop your whimpering. They caught a Yankee spy. They're going to hang her and they want you as a witness at the court martial. Now come on. I met the girl twice. Once at the river and again I bumped into her in the garden. She seemed just a pretty colored girl without a thought in her mind but men. She's pretty alright. - Quite. We'll find out soon enough. If she's innocent she'll tell the truth. You mean she'll admit she knows Mrs Cushman? Mrs Cushman admitted it, hasn't she? Witnesses have seen them together. If this girl denies she's just putting a rope around her neck. That's all. Sir, the witness is outside. - Bring her in. Gentlemen, we will proceed. Bring in the prisoner. Raise your right hand. Do you swear the evidence you're about to give in the cause now in hearing .. Shall be truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Yes. I do. Lucille. Do you know this lady? Do you or don't you? Yes, sir. Did you know her before she came to Martinsburg? Yes, sir. Is she Pauline Cushman the play-actress? Yes, sir. Where did you know her? I was a maid in the theater at New Orleans. How did you come to leave her? I found out that she was a Yankee. The girl is telling the truth. We knew they were acquainted. I. I loved you, ma'am. Only you turned Yankee. I loved you too, Lucille. I hope no harm comes to you, ma'am. Thank you, Lucille. Madam. It is distressing to pronounce death upon a woman. But the needs of my country demand it. However. I can offer you a reprieve. If you reveal the name of your accomplice. I let this become known throughout the camp in the hope the accomplice .. Spare yourself the trouble, General. My accomplice understands. He has a greater duty to his country than to me. Take the prisoner away. Any special orders? Just don't disturb her until the preacher comes. Post 3 relieved. I've got an outfit for you. Quick. Wait, Pauline. Change your clothes. Quick. - Then help me. She isn't in the tent, sir. Anybody after you? - Not yet. Hurry up. Put the sentry under arrest. - Corporal. Sergeant, form a squad for pursuit. - Yes, sir. You, inform to General Stuart the spy has escaped. Bring me my horse. Blow the general advance. [ Bugle call ] We move at once. We'll cross the Potomac before that Yankee spy gets through with her news. Forward, ho! Not one confederate crossed the river. Maybe you'll admit now that my department amounts to something. Your department? It was Gray's artillery that prevented Storm from .. Yes. But how did Gray know that Storm was to be there? Well, he had information. - You bet he had information. Information that I obtained through my operators. 13 and 27. Colonel, the secret service saved Washington this time. Battles are won by military strategy. I hope nothing happened to them. I wish for some word. Captain Hitchcock reports, sir. Never mind that. Has anything happened to 13 and 27? They're here. Talking their heads off. - What happened? The Rebs wanted to hang 27. But 13 wouldn't let them. Good. Good. Miss Loveless. Ladies. I salute you. Thank you, Major Allen. Can you go so far as to say where we can get a bath? Please. And lots of soap. See? That's all they talked about for two hours. A bath. Canons roaring, brave men dying. Jeb Stuart licked. All they talk about is a bath. Well, ladies. You know yourselves better than I do. They look as though they needed a bath. Ladies, you shall have it. The best bath we can provide. Thank you, Major. What I must say is more important than your good looks, young woman. Not to me, Colonel. Your department. Please proceed, Colonel. Miss Loveless, did you ever hear of the 'Sons of Liberty'? No, sir. - You'll hear plenty. The Sons of Liberty .. Is a secret military organisation formed in the north by southern sympathisers. They call them 'Copperheads'. I've heard of them. - This isn't the same thing. This isn't mere oratory. This is a well-knit organization having over half a million determined members. They plan to mobilise under Confederate officers. To seize Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri. And proclaim a new nation. To be known as the Northwest Confederacy. Goodness gracious. Goodness gracious? My dear young woman, let me inform you .. That Washington believes they have a chance of success. Unless we can nip the plot right now. In your report you mention a Captain Gailliard. Yes. You said he arrived unexpectedly. Immediately afterwards the attack was decided upon. Where did he come from? - From the north I gathered. I'll stake my life it's the same man. What is he like, this Captain Gailliard? Keenly intelligent. Rather attractive. And very good-looking. From such a slight contact he seems to have made a deep impression. The facts are these, Operator 13. We believe this Captain Gailliard to be the Confederate officer .. Who's been organizing the Sons Of Liberty in the north. He has evidently gone south to complete preparations there. Miss Loveless. I am sending you to Richmond. How? - In due time. I want you to find this Captain Gailliard. I want you to establish beyond question. That he is the man. And then? One of our operators will make himself known to you. The password will be .. 'It is a night of stars'. But why? The rest is hardly work for a woman. I can't. This is war. Not china painting. I don't call that war. I call it murder. Does it matter what you call it? Will you go? Well. Pauline. Operator 27. There is no Operator 27. - Not? When her identity was discovered Miss Cushman's usefulness to us ceased. I sent her north this morning while you slept. And you want me to go? Alone? Unless you want a nursemaid. Murderers. Assassins. Down with them. Down with Yankee riff-raff. Down with the Yankee dogs. Leave him alone. He is for the Yankees. You will have to go with me. Young lady. This is Mr John Hay. President Lincoln's secretary. President Lincoln pardons you for your attack on the sovereignty of the union. On the condition. That you go forthwith to the south which you love so well. You'll be given safe conduct through the union lines, Miss Clayburn. Please do not interrupt. Miss Ann Clayburn. Here are all of your letters which have been censored. Your father, Josiah Clayburn. Will be interned for the duration of the war in the old capitol prison. The newspapers are already heaping abuse upon President Lincoln .. For not sending you both to face a firing squad. Gentlemen of the press. I trust you will emphasize the fact that Mr Lincoln's attitude in this matter .. Has been both humane and just. That will be all, gentlemen. I still don't understand. I did what I was told. It's all very simple. There is a Josiah Clayburn and he has a daughter Ann. They were taken in a copperhead raid in New York three days ago. We hold them in prison. So you are going south to Richmond as the martyr. Ann Clayburn. Suppose there's somebody in Richmond who knows the real Ann Clayburn? We hope not. Did you read this one, marked the 23rd? 'Miss Ann Clayburn, the confederate sympathiser ..' 'Seized with her father'. 'Was conducted through the union lines pursuant to the President's order'. 'A storm of criticism has been aroused by even this leniency'. Etc, etc. Yes. I've read about the case. The newspapers have been full of it. Jack. She is in Richmond. Why not? She's lucky she is not in a northern prison. You didn't meet her when you were in New York, did you? I don't know. I remember her father. Vaguely. I met him in a room with fifty people all talking at once. A real fire-eater. Stamps up and down sounding off like a gatling gun. Were there women there? Girls? Yes. Some. Do you remember any in particular? Well, look this girl up. She's over at Mrs Shackleford's. Mrs Shackleford? Yes. The lady found her in the Spotwood Hotel. Sitting helplessly amid her baggage. And took her home. She's quite a heroine. Find out all you can about her. Suspicious? Of my own grandmother. There is one thing I like about it. - What's that? The Shackleford's have got a good cook. Yes, ma'am. Miss Shackleford knows I'm the best cook in the south. No thank you. - Please do, honey. Otherwise, what will you think of the Shackleford hospitality? Johnny Pelham, I won't have it. Mother, how about this thing? He's trying to get rid of me now he's commissioned as a Captain. Eleanor, stop talking nonsense. Anyone for more coffee? I'd love some. - Good. He says he's been broken-hearted. That he can't see me so much anymore. Why? His company is moving to Drewry's Bluff. They are laying the .. What is it, Johnny? The emplacement for a battery of heavy cannon. Eleanor. I told you that was not for publication. Darling. I wouldn't think of saying anything to the outsiders. I'm so ignorant I don't know if it's important to have cannon there. Important? Darling, that's the key to the whole situation. Listen. Johnny's been explaining to me. That with a battery there. If the Yankees go up the river we can blow them to pieces. Eleanor, for heavens sake. Why don't you use a speaking trumpet? Maybe they can hear you in Washington. Johnny. If you don't stop being so picky .. And fussing at me over nothing. When we're not even married. And won't be for a week. Four days to be exact. Who's that? No. It's Captain Gailliard. Mother, who do you think? It is Jack Gailliard. Such a nice young man. I know you'll like him. Like him? Honey, you'll be crazy about him. Come, Ann. I want you to meet him. Hello Jack. I bet I know what you're doing around here. Come in. We've a surprise for you. You got here just in time for coffee. It's so nice to see you again. Hello Jack. I bet somebody told you the Shacklefords had a pretty girl with them. You would ruin things for me. And how is the pretty girl who is always at the Shacklefords? Now that's what I call tact. Come, Captain. I want to present you to our guest. Miss Clayburn, may I present Captain Gailliard? Jack, of course you have heard of Miss Clayburn. The way you are staring, you'd think you never saw a pretty girl before. That's not very complimentary to the flower of the south. Eleanor. Yes, mother? Pardon me, but haven't I seen you before somewhere? I must be a very commonplace type. People are always fancying that. There's something about your mouth and eyes. It is very unlikely that we've met. Unless you've been north. Captain, did you know Miss Clayburn has never been south before? And now that I'm here I'd love to remain for the rest of my life. It is so lovely. That is sweet, my dear. But you've not seen anything of it. Our grounds are very charming. Mother. Ann doesn't want to look at our grounds. Mother rarely waits until a stranger has his hat off before trying to show them. I'd love to see them. There. See? Why don't you young people go for a walk and show Ann about? Will you come with us, Mrs Shackleford? - No. I have a million things to do. But you all go and enjoy yourselves. It smells so wonderful. Jasmine. Imagine you not knowing jasmine. - We never have jasmine in the north. Eleanor. What is that? I am so ignorant. A nightingale. No. - Yes. You've heard of nightingales. - Yes. But I never believed in them. I always thought that the owl was the only bird that had insomnia. Don't tell me they don't have nightingales in the north either. No. Is there nothing charming in the north except you? Just for the moment, the south has the monopoly on charm. Now, if you look inside you will find the old oaken bucket. Would you care to look? - No. I trust you. Well. Ahead of you you see the old swing of your childhood. Oh, it is. I haven't seen one of those for years. My turn first. Certainly. How charming of you. Thank you. Everything is so perfect. It doesn't seem possible there's a war on. There isn't. That's right. There isn't. Once in a lifetime. Love comes your way. Once in a lifetime. It really comes to stay. When you discover. The stars are just right. And somebody whispers .. I am lonesome tonight. Once in a blue moon. The waiting ends. Beneath a new moon. You take .. what heaven sends. Two arms around you. So glad that they found you. Once in a lifetime. Dear. You aren't even listening. - Yes I am. I doubt it. It's your face. It bothers me. It bothered me too until I got used to it. No. I didn't mean that. Hello. Jack, the army will be in bed before you get back to camp. I'll wait for you at the gate. Right. This is the first time in a while that I've talked for hours and said nothing. It's been great. I am coming again. Do. When? Shall we say next .. Tomorrow? I would be delighted. Goodnight. It's a night of stars, ma'am. It's a night of stars and bars. How many stars do you count? Thirteen. Thirteen and fifty-five. Any news? Yes. They're building a battery at Drewry's Bluff. And Captain Gailliard? - I am .. I am not sure yet. I'll be on hand, ma'am. Whenever you are ready. Drewry's Bluff you say? - Yes. It's the night of stars. How many you count? - Fifty-five. Go ahead. - Drewry's Bluff. Heavy battery. It's the night of stars. - How many stars do you count? Eighteen. - Jury's Bluff. Heavy battery. Alright. What is it? - Drewry's Bluff. They headed that way. - Right. 'Drewry's Bluff'. 'Heavy battery'. Take it, son. And run fast. 'Drewry's Bluff. Heavy battery'. We must go in, dear. After all, being a bridesmaid .. Haven't you heard? Johnny Pelham sent word he can't be here before midnight. And you can't have a wedding without the bridegroom. They'll be dancing for hours. - But Eleanor might .. Eleanor is upstairs dressing. Please. In that case. Honey, if you don't stand still I'll smack you. Eleanor. If you don't stop jiggling, mammy will never get your dress on. I can see that in the papers. 'Eleanor Shackleford, due to her inability to stand still ..' Was married last evening in her underclothes. You make her hurry, mammy. - Yes, ma'am. There is something about the atmosphere at weddings that is exciting. I love them. I suppose you'll cry during the ceremony. Of course. And I'll try to catch the bride's bouquet. Sleep with a piece of wedding cake under my pillow. Superstitious, aren't you? - Frightfully. Aren't you? Nope. I walk under ladders right and left. Laugh in black cats' faces and break a mirror regularly before breakfast. And nothing has ever happened to you? Nope. Nothing has ever happened to me. Until. Tonight. You're the most beautifullest bride I ever did see, Miss Eleanor. I have to be the most beautifullest bride. Because I am marrying the most handsomest man in the world. Tell me. Does every girl think her sweetheart is the most handsome man in the world? Lord, no. When I married my Sam. I upped and told him. He has the ugliest black face I'd ever step foot on. You don't marry them because of their face .. You marry them because .. - I know. You married them because if you don't .. There is no reason to stay alive. Johnny. I. Love. You. No, no, no. But I tell you the angle of shot must be carefully determined. They found in many cases .. - See here. Just because you had two years at West Point. Doesn't mean you now all about heavy ordnance. I don't want you to be late for your own wedding. Come on, John. - I tell you. Stop the argument, Major. Come on, brush up and get on your way. We experimented at West Point and found that was the way it was. We'll fight this war for a while yet. You're starting one of your own. Go ahead. Drewry's Bluff. Three degrees west of north. Four thousand yards. Range, thirty-eight hundred. Elevation. Forty-five. Load. Eighteen. Move. Stand by there. Fire! Fire! Prepare for action. Man your guns. Start firing right away. Take your stations. Yankees. Treacherous cowards. Gentlemen, to your stations. It's Drewry's Bluff alright. Please don't go away and leave me. There's no gun like that on the confederate side. It's mounted on a flatcar. I'll find out what it is and be right back. Ann. What is it? Eleanor. Don't. Don't. Fire! Why does he take so long? He'll come back. The Colonel mentioned .. General Clayton, ma'am. And there's no word from Captain Pelham yet, ma'am. Ann, darling. Don't be frightened. Frightened? Captain. Captain Gailliard. Miss Shackleford is waiting in the library. Jack. Jack! Tell me about John. Tell me about John. Tell me about him. Jack. Jack. Darling, come in the other room. - I've got to know. Don't you see? I know you're going to tell me something. It can't be. Eleanor, darling. Please tell me what's happened. Johnny Pelham killed in action. What will poor Eleanor do now? That poor lamb. Ann. Ann. - Jack. I was so afraid. Don't leave me. Don't leave me. - I won't. Jack. War is .. The cruellest thing in the world. I hate it. I hate it. I know. War teaches one thing. To live while we can. Ann. I love you. I know I shouldn't tell you but .. In the morning I am leaving for the north. Say you love me. Say you'll be waiting for me when .. If I come back. I do love you, Jack. I do. Can't you understand? Can't you? Jack. I love you. I love you. Jack. I love you. Is Captain Gailliard still here? - Yes, sir. He is. Right this way, sir. I'm sure Captain Channing wants to see me. Excuse me, dear. I'll be right back. - Yes. Ma'am. Quick. They mean business. It may be you they're after. Find out. I'll hide there. - Right. Captain Gailliard? - Out on the outside. Captain Gailliard. A word with you in private, sir. - Certainly. This way. Where is this Ann Clayburn? Why do you ask? She is not Ann Clayburn at all. - We just found out. The real Ann Clayburn .. Is in a northern prison. Her father was arrested with her. Quick, ma'am. Put these on. The owner won't need them for a while. - Alright. You be on the lookout. It's hard to believe. If I had gotten here a day earlier with the news .. The disaster of Drewry's Bluff would never have happened. Where is she now? - Miles away. I just left her. Why didn't you say so before? Hurry. They're coming. Run. Morning, uncle. Morning, sir. You're up early. Yes, sir. These catfish keep early hours, master. Have you seen a couple of confederate soldiers riding hard for the north? No, sir. Ain't seen nobody except you, sir. [ Horse noises ] Heaven sakes. Is the confederates fighting each other? I thought it was the yanks. - Quiet. Ain't nobody there but the horses, sir. - What horses? Just two little horses, master. - What you talking about? I found them standing by the river at the crack of day. They were too tuckered to graze the grass. So I took their saddles off. Did you see the riders? No, sir. I ain't seen nobody nowhere, sir. Wait. Gailliard. Come here. I found their horses. Hello. Hello there. Hello there. There doesn't seem to be anyone there. If there is, leave the talking to me. Alright. They left in a hurry. Whoever it was. Try to keep awake, 13. Alright. Where you going? - There's a brigade just over the ridge. You go inland a way. I follow the river. - Good. Get up, yankee. Jack. - You go back with me. Alright. To Richmond? - Yes. To Richmond. To court martial. And on our way back we'll pass Drewry's Bluff. Jack. I couldn't help it. I knew what would happen if I were caught. And I am caught now. That pays for everything, doesn't it? You can't blame me. - Blame? I despise you. You're a spy yourself, Jack. - Yes, I am. But I'm a man. A soldier. I'm not a woman who lets people befriend her because she is a woman. And then stabs them in the back. I'm not a woman who gains the confidence of a sweet, trusting girl. And destroys her life's happiness. I didn't know that he .. how could I? You led her on deliberately just as you led me on. You pretended you loved me. That wasn't pretence, Jack. It was true. Can't you understand? I do love you, Jack. Liar. Cheat. It's still the truth. But I know you won't believe me. Take me to Richmond. - Hold out your hands. Come on. Union troops. Channing. Guard, halt. Company, left turn. Order arms. Thank you, Chaplain. Cheroot? Thank you, sir. May .. I handle this? Right. Please don't let it happen. Detail ready, sir. Captain Channing will command. Squad. Ready. Squad. Aim. Hold it steady, Yanks. Steady. Fire! Well, call them. What? I'm the prisoner now. I can't get away. They're your troops. Call them. Go on, call them. Do your duty. - Duty? Duty to what? To destruction. To kill you. The man I love. And I do love you, Jack. I do. Do you see him? Well, get him. Rebels along the river. Rebels along the river. Now's our chance. Quick. Don't look. Come on. Quick. Hold this. Your side, the confederates. Join them and slip out now. What becomes of you? - I'll be alright. Union troops will pass by now. - They'll shoot you on sight. I don't care. I love you, Jack. And I want you to be safe. Please. Please go. Go, Jack. I love you. Them yankees are all around us. Yankees. I'm done for. Attention. What is that? Guns saluting the victory of the north, sir. Stop that foolishness. There is no victory. Only peace. There is no north now, and no south. Attention. Present arms! We must all forget. Forget war. Forget hate. Forget division. And remember only .. Loyalty. And love. ..w-g..
