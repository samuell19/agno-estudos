- Lot of work? - No, today is fine. Yes, it is. Are you going to the hotel? I will finish here and go later. I'm going to the hotel now. Are you busy? I'm not that busy. So, shall we go together? No problem. I can come back later. Come back later? Yes. - Anyways, continue. - OK. CLAIRE'S CAMERA ISABELLE HUPPERT KIM MINHEE CHANG MIHEE JUNG JINYOUNG WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY HONG SANGSOO Manager Jeon! What are you doing here? Why didn't you come back? No, I'm still around. I wanted to enjoy it. But why stay here? Did you stay here all the time? Yes, I did. It's been very hard for us without you! Oh really? Has it been hard for you? I'm sorry. But you were the most harmed. Anyway, what happened? What can I tell...? Why did you give up so suddenly? It was forced, I didn?t want to. - Who forced it? The boss? - Yes, she asked me to resign. Why? For what reason? Who knows? I'm curious too. But how could she do that? You are the treasure of our company. She always said it about you. I'm also curious to know why she fired me. But what did she say? Three days ago I was in the cabin, - we get back to the hotel together. - I know, I was there, too. Then she invited me for a coffee. Invited? We were drinking coffee and then, she told me. That I should resign. She forced me. What could I do? I did what I was told. This is ridiculous. Why did she ask you to resign? Don't tell anyone about it. Of course, I won't. I need some time to think it over. That's why I'm still here. Sure. It's important. - It' been five years. - Yes, it does. Exactly five years today. I think you have a good heart, you know? Thanks. No need to thank me. It's true. No... But you wanted to talk about something? Why are so rushed today? - What you mean? - Usually you're very calm. Lost in thought. With a good heart, like I said. I'm not sure if I have a good heart. But having a good heart doesn't necessarily mean that you are honest. What? Do you know what's most important for me about a co-worker? I'm not sure. Honesty. It's something precious. A natural born attribute. It's not something you can achieve with time. That's why I hired you, you know that? I got it. Still... Even though I think you have a good heart, I've come to the conclusion. of what... there's no guarantee of your honesty. Why did you come to this conclusion? Do you think I'm dishonest? Yes, a little. I do, I'm sorry. - It's the way I see it. - Alright. There's nothing I can do about it. But I don't know why you think it. It doesn't matter. It's just the way I see things. No matter how I came to that conclusion. You don't need to know. If you tell me, I can try to fix it. I always considered myself honest. As I said, it's not something you can achieve. If we lose confidence in someone, we should no longer work with that person. I understand. So you shouldn't have made that kind of mistake. I'm curious about your reasons. I finally decided to support my conclusion. Now... comes the hardest part. Let's stop working together. Oh, really? Yes. I'm serious. I'm sorry... To see things this way. And if you don't mind, let's not wait until return to Seoul. Let's finish everything here today. Today? This is very shocking. I'm really intrigued. Why do you see things like that? I should give you some time. But if you do not mind, I'd rather we go in separate ways now. For the sake of our team. Besides that, working with someone I don't feel comfortable with... it's not easy, so let's avoid this trouble. Sure. It can't be helped if you see things that way. Although I still don't understand your reasons. Trust in my judgment. It was a tough to decide it. You're so nice, lying there. You are very nice. Manhee? What about... we take a picture together? To register our farewell? I think... that would be a good way to celebrate my resignation. Do you really need to do this? Well... We've been together for a long time, so I'd like a photo. - Are you serious? - Yes. One, two, three! It hurts me to do that. I wanted to work with you for a long time. Me too, but I guess it won't happen. We'll meet again someday. I'm sure we will. How was it with a young girl? Sorry to delay your work. It's not a delay. I can do her job. I'm sorry. Gosh. So you feel sorry? Of course. It's so recent. We should eat before your interviews. I wish I could not do them. - How many? - Two. You have to, it's not many. I know. So, she's back in Seoul? I don't know, she left the hotel. Why? Do you miss her? It's not that. But she leaving during the festival... She worked for you for a long time, right? Yes. - About five years? - Right. And was she good in her role? Did she help you a lot? She was meticulous. That's why I hired her, despite her English. What? Was her English bad? She has no ear for tongues. I didn't know it. She had style though. It was easy to have her around. The men liked her. It was the alcohol. Without alcohol, it would never have happened. I know. You are not the type to do this without alcohol. 95% of my life's mistakes were alcohol driven. If it happens again, we will separate for good. Don't worry, it won't repeat. Why should I worry? Yes, you're right. Look that! This ship is huge. You will come here often. Control yourself. Yeah. I'm going to work a lot. Help me. That's our deal. Yes. I'm really going to work. That's it. I help you. Come here. - Hello. - Hello. - Are you here to see Director So? - No, why? This is his hotel. I'll meet him later. For what? To say hello. He was my teacher. I see. Yes, he taught class. But he barely taught and always drank with his students. Are you close to him? Not at all. I don't even know if he remembers me. - Is that so? - Yes. Mrs. Nam will join us as well. - Really? - My short was shown here. - Right. - After seeing it, she asked me to meet with Director So. She wants to make a movie with you? I guess not. I don't think I'm mature to make a movie. Maturity has nothing to do with making movies. You need honesty. It's hard to make an honest movie. You also need to be honest in life. But this is not easy. Yes, honesty is important. Well, I have to go. - Really? - We talk later. - Right. - Bye. See you. - It's my first time at Cannes. - Is that so? Yes, I never came. For real. This is my first time too, I'm very happy - What's the exhibit hour? - At 7:00 p.m. - 7:00? - The twentieth. - It's a good time. - Yes. - Very well then. - I'll wait for you. Right. Where are you from? I'm from Korea. - You're Korean? - Yeah. Yes, I'm Korean. - Where you are from? - I'm from Paris. Paris! So... - You are French? - Yes. I just arrived a few hours ago. My friend is showing her movie at the festival - Oh really? - I came down with her. Oh, I see. I'm showing my film here too. I'm a film director. You are a film director? I was right. I thought you were an artist. - Oh really? - Yes. Thank you! You look like an artist too. What do you do for a living? No, I'm not an artist. I'm teacher. A teacher? But write poetry sometimes. Purely for my pleasure. And I make photos too. With this. I see... you're a poet. You're an artist too. Yes, I guess so. - Can I sit with you? - Yes. Thank you. What is your name? My name is So. - So? - Yes. - My name is Claire. -Claire? What a beautiful name. - Very happy to meet you. - Very happy to meet you too. Yeah. What's your name, again? Can I find you on Google? Oh I think so. It's So Wansoo. With S. - S? - S-O W-A-N - Two "U"? -No, just W. - W. - Yeah. W-A-N-S-O-O. Yeah, is me. Is me. LIBRARY - Here? - Yes. It's a beautiful book. - Can you read it here? - Yeah. "I want to talk about a person. A man of about 25 at most. He's a handsome man, who wants to die before being marked by death. You loved him. More than that." Beautiful, it's great. - Your voice is great. - Oh thank you. Beautiful. It's a strange poem. Strange? Yes, a little. But I like it. I wish I could read French. It is a very difficult language to learn. I see. But I want to memorize this poem. Even just one poem, for fun. - Can you teach me how to pronounce? - Sure. Come this way. Yes. - So you repeat after me. - Yes. - That! - Yeah. Very good. No, it's... Yeah. It's a "P". You're saying like an "F", it's a "P". "P", yeah. - Very good. - Right. How beautiful! What a beautiful dog! Are you resting? - It's beautiful, right? - Yes, beautiful. You're beautiful. Bye bye. See you! Bye. - Thank you. - You're welcome. It's only a photo. You don't have to thank me. I know. - But I want to thank you. - Why? Because taking a photo is something very important. Oh, I see. - Why is it very important? - Because if I take a photo of you, you're not the same person anymore. - Oh really? - Yes. - What do you mean? - I don't mean anything. It's just how I feel about it. Interesting. So I am a different person now? Yes. - I think so. - Okay. Let me see this picture. What's the difference between this picture and myself? Well, I know it's just a photo. But you've actually changed now. And I can feel it. - Really? - Yes. I don't buy it. I'm a very sensitive person. But... Can you look at me now? My eyes. - Your eyes? - Yes, please. Okay. Am I the same person? Am I the same person you saw a few hours ago? Can't you see the differences? No. It's funny. What is this? Why I feel this way? It's just strange. It's because I took your picture some few minutes ago. Why don't you take a picture of me? - I want to see that you're not joking. - Okay. - Can I see? - Sure. - It's yours. - Thank you. Let me look at your eyes again. - Yes, if you want. - Hm. This is funny. Does it look different? You want to look at them? - I took these pictures this morning. - Oh thank you. It's a good picture. - Oh, thank you. - Yeah. Why is she here? Do you know her? Yes, I know her. She's Korean. She's... Manhee. - When did you take this picture? - This morning. When I arrived. I was on the roof of a big hotel. She was so pretty. I asked if I could take her picture. Oh, really? But... What she was doing here? She's not supposed to be here. And all this makeup... I don't know exactly. She was very busy talking with people. How can I say? She was a very popular girl there. Look at this. I've never seen her like this. Why is she wearing so much makeup? You're right. You know her too? Yes, she was my employee. - Oh, I see. - Yes. May I? - Yes. - Thank you. I'm sorry. Is it okay? - It's okay, I don't mind. - Oh, thank you. You look like an artist. - Do I? - Yes! I've been watching you for a long time. - Really? - It made me feel good. I'm happy to hear that. - Are you an artist? - No, I'm not an artist. - I wish I was. - Oh, that's bad. But you're feeling better. So that's good! Yes, you're right. You're so pretty. I know that? - Am I? - Yeah! Thank you but, you're beautiful too. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. So you came here alone? Yes, I'm alone... and nobody to talk to. - If you want, you can talk to me. - Thank you. We need someone to talk to. - What do you do for a living? - I'm teacher. I'm a film selling person. - You sell films? - Yes, I sell films. But selling is no fun. - If you know what I mean. - I know. Selling is no fun. Nothing fun at all. Any selling is no fun. We shouldn't sell anything. I agree, no selling of any sorts. I'm happy we agreed. Agree is great. I agree 100%. - So are you French? - Yes. - I'm from Paris. - Ah, you're from Paris... So which part of Paris? I live in the 14th arrondissement. Are you familiar with Paris? No. I've been there for a long time ago. Only two times. Two times... - Where you are from? - I'm from Korea. What are the 3 things you like most in Korea? I like food, I like my memories there, and I like my friends. I've never had Korean food before. I know about Kimchi, but I have never really had really Korean food. That's bad. But it's ok. You can have it now if you want. Do you have a Korean restaurant here? No, they don't have it here. But in our apartment I used to stay. There's a lot of Korean food. I can make one Korean dish for you, you might like. Really? Could you really do that for me? I will be happy to cook for you. - What's your name, anyway? - My name is Claire. - And what's yours? - Manhee. Manhee. - You want to go now? For that cooking? - Yes why not? Let's go. Wow! This is great. - Nice? - Yeah. What do you do for a living? Ah yes, you told me. You're a teacher. I'm a poet too. And I take photos too, with this. - Oh, it's great. - Yes, it's great. You can write poems anytime you want, it's not that difficult. I sometimes make songs, they're very childish songs. But they make me feel good. So you're a composer. You are an artist too. - Do you want to hear my song? - Sure, I'd love to. Okay, so... One, two, two, three, three Four, four, five... Six, six, seven, seven... Eight, eight, eight, ten... All the numbers are important We count everything with numbers We do not know, we do not know Only we count in numbers It's wonderful! Thank you! Easy song. Oh, it's great, you have a beautiful voice. Thank you. Thank you very much! The gala exhibition is tomorrow. With your health, you should not strain yourself. I feel frustrated. How can I say? I'm against the wall. Too many worries, I guess. What are you worried about? - It's just... - Tell me. It's just... Nothing special. At these times, I like to drink. Do you want to get drunk? Why drink so fast? I'm already drunk. I drank a lot! Wait... Are you thinking about Manhee? - Is that? - Manhee? Manhee. I'm worried it was my mistake. What is the problem? You slept with her while you were drunk. And she wanted too. I just feel sorry. Something is wrong with me. I feel like this. Or maybe you miss her. I don't think so. Anyway, something is definitely wrong with me. - You're pathetic. - What? What did you say? That you're pathetic. You get drunk, sleep with a girl. Why are you so worried? Sorry to say that, but I have to... I wish I had said it before. What? You and I have a good working relationship, and we respect each other. But I don't think we should be a couple anymore. So we can work together for a long time. Are you serious? Yes, I think so. I think I let you drink too much. It's not that. That way we can stay together for a long time. What is the real reason? - That's what I said. - What are you saying? For our sake, while my mind is still sane. Now... We need to stop this now. While you're still beautiful and to avoid any troubles. Right. If that's the way you see it, go for it. Thank you. Don't get me wrong. Trust in my judgment. You didn't convince me. Even so... if that's the way you see it. Right or wrong, you see things that way. I will respect that. Thank you. I like you very much. You are remarkable. They broke up with me again. I'm embarrassed. I immersed myself in this relationship. What a waste of time. It's the only way we can continue with comfort. It's to last a long time. Think this way. I need to think over about the 'long time'. Your eyes are very pretty. Seeing you like this, they really are. I know. To be honest, I'm still pretty. Yes you are. Can't you like me as before? When we met, you adored me. Can't we go back to that time? Director So! I?m Yanghye. Your lovely Yanghye. I know. When we first met in Busan, you were so beautiful. That's true. I was pretty back then. Right. You still are. - Oh really? - You are beautiful! So you're still here. I'm so lucky. - Ah, you came back! - Yes. I left my coat here. I'm so stupid. - We were expecting you. - Oh really? - Thank you. - Here's your coat. You drank a lot, So. You look like a drunk! Yes, I'm drunk. I want to get drunk. You want to get drunk? You know? I'm fifty. I need to get drunk. - So, you're fifty. - Fifty. Yeah, I'm 50 now. Good. I need to go. And take good care of yourself. - You have to go? - Yes. - Bye, bye. - Bye, Claire. - Here, your sunglasses. - Oh, thank you. - It's a nice day. - Yeah, it's a beautiful day. Yes. - I'm hungry. - Are you hungry? Yes. - Don't worry, Claire. - Come with me. - I'll cook for you. - Oh, thank you. Hey. Excuse me. Thanks. Sorry, we cannot use the elevator. It?s out of order. It looks okay to me. It looks okay now, but it sometimes stops in the middle. A few days ago, I was stuck there in the elevator. Really? - It must have been frightening. - Yes, I was so scared. I'm scared of elevators too. - You mean, even when they work properly? - Actually, I hate elevators. Yes, I see. So let's go walking. Sure. It's okay. I like this painting. They look alright. - But they're kind of strange, too. - Oh, you think so? They are strange. Don't you think? Yes, they're strange looking at it now. Yes. - Very strange. - Yes, very strange. - Eat some fruit. - Thanks. It was a great meal. I should have cooked, not you. It's all right. We needed to eat anyway. Luckily we had a bit of bulgogi. I thought it would be hard, but it is not. We buy in the market. It's better than the supermarket. It was great. You're a good cook. Thank you, I enjoy cooking. Yes, I can see that. - Can I take a picture of you? - Me? Yes! I like your face. You have a very feminine face. You're right. He has a cute face, like a woman's. And he has a woman's heart too. You think so? He has that quality. - Can I? - Sure! - Can I see? - Sure. You can have it if you want. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Do you want to look at them? - Oh, thank you. - This one is good, beautiful! - Oh really? - I'm happy you like it. - Yes, this one is very beautiful. - You have great talent. - Oh, thank you very much. What is it? Why is he here? Do you know him? Oh, So? Yes, I know him. - He's kind of a drunkard. - Yes, you're right. But how do you know him? I met him accidentally in a caf?. So you know him? - Yes. - He's a film director. Yes, he is. You met him by chance? I think he's a real drunkard. Probably now he's totally drunk. Yes, he likes drinking. It's so funny you met him. In fact, we know him very well. Look, it's Director So. It's really him. How funny. How did she get it? It looks like an old photo. There was a Korean woman. And she was in love with him. Really? I took her picture too. But she wanted to have it. Who was she? She said she was kind of producer. I didn't get it properly. She was speaking with strong English accent. Was she good looing? She was alright. But a little strange, too. I see. She was strange? What are you thinking? I think she was my boss. She's the one who dismissed me. Oh, I didn't know that. She's the one who fired you? Yes, she did. - Even without telling me why. - Really? Can they do that? Yes, they can do that. She told some very strange reason to dismiss me. What's it? She told me she found out I'm a dishonest person. But she didn't tell me why she thinks I'm dishonest person. Is she an honest person herself? I don't think so. I wonder what she was thinking when she dismissed you. You're such a nice girl! I think I know why now. Do you? - What is it? - I think... I better tell you later. She was just jealous. Yeah? - She was jealous? - Yes. Excuse. - You want another more? - Yes, thank you. The same, please. - Thank you. - No problem. - Manhee, it's you. - Director? - Nice to see you. - So are you still here? I was going to catch a flight back, but I couldn't change my ticket. So I thought I'd stick around. I heard you got fired. Funny, right? Aren't you cold? The wind is strong. I'm not cold. It's windy today. You look cold. I am fine. Your makeup... is so strong. That? I just put in a little bit more. That's it? I was very surprised to see you here. You're in a suit. - You are handsome! - It's just something to cover me. I must use it, it's not mine. I borrowed. Still, it's beautiful. When you decided to wear this skirt, what were you thinking? It's a shorts with high waist, not a skirt. I know. It's too short. I thought it was pretty. I bought it in Seoul. - Do you want men staring at you? - What? You want that kind of cheap attention from men? No! So why turn yourself into a show? If you were 18, wanting to try and copy everything, I would even understand. But how old are you? Why to become an object of cheap attention? What do you get out of it? Do you earn something worthwhile? Even a decent thing? - No. - I'm a man, I get that! Why turn yourself into a cheap show? You are beautiful! With a beautiful soul. You do not need to be exposed like that. Why to hurt yourself like that? Are you proud when you look in the mirror? No! Don't do it. You are so beautiful! You have a beautiful soul. It doesn't matter how people see it. Be yourself. Don't try to seduce people or sell yourself! Got it? Yes. You never did that? What? I'm a man. Well... Why don't you leave? Don't stay here with me. - Should I? - Yes, go away. Don't stay here with me. - I'm with someone else now. - Oh really? Then I'm leaving. You look cold! Goodbye. - We gotta go. - Right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't take pictures! - So this is the caf?? - Yes, this is caf?. - And where did you sit? - We sat at this table. And there were other people here? No, I don't think so. It was a very windy day. So people didn't want to sit outside. I see. And there was a big dog lying here. Oh really? I think I saw that dog too. A very big dog. - I think it was gray. - Yes, you're right. - You saw that dog too? - Yes! It's so strange. Yeah, this is a good sign. Because I saw the dog that you saw. There's a possibility that that dog belongs here. Right. It's possible, because he was lying here for a long time. And very comfortably. Perhaps we should ask the owner. - I'll wait here. - Okay. Do you know what's most important for me about a co-worker? Honesty. It's something precious. A natural born attribute. It's not something you can achieve with time. That's why I hired you, you know that? I got it. Still... Even though I think you have a good heart, I've come to the conclusion of what there's no guarantee of your honesty. Why did you come to this conclusion? Do you think I'm dishonest? Yes, a little. I just figured that out. I'm sorry. It's as I see it. Why do you take pictures? Because the only way to change things is to look at everything again very slowly. That sounds very nice. - Do you want to drink something? - Drink? Yes! Some wine, perhaps? I don't drink wine any more. I used to drink, but not anymore. - Beer, then? - Beer is fine. Okay. Does it have any meaning? No. I just want to do this. Why? Because I hate the whole world. You mean the life you're living? Yes, I guess so. They're same things. How many? 22. And how do you feel? - I feel great, really great. - Good! You can cut more clothes if you want. Yes, maybe. But I feel really good now. - They're beautiful. - You think so? Yes, they are nice. Yes. They're gorgeous. What do you teach at the school? I teach music. - In high school. - I see. Do you have a boyfriend? He passed away a few months ago. He was a bookstore owner. And he taught me piano, too. - Do you remember him often? - Oh, yes. I remember him every day. He's still alive to me. He taught me how to live. When he died, I almost wanted to commit suicide. You loved him that much? Oh, yes. I loved him very much. Great... - you love someone like that... - Yes I know. I'm lucky. Yes. It's my boss. She wants to see me now. She said she's right in front of my place. - You'll see her? - Let me see. She is here. It's so funny... Why is she want to see me? You want me to go? I think you can stay. I'll go down first and talk to her. - And see what happens. - Okay. - Can you stay? - Oh sure, I have nothing to do. Okay, I'll be right back. Have some apples there. - You're not cold? - No, I'm okay. How did you know I was here? Sungyeon said you were here, so I sent you a message. We need to talk. Sure. - Are you sure you're not cold? - Yes. - You want help? - No, go do your work. - I got it. - No! Go do your work! Translated by gooz karagarga, 2018
