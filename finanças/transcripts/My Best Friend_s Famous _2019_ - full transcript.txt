I think he's dead! - What happened? - He made me choke him and taze him at the same time. I didn't want to but he begged me. - So you did it?! - Well he said it was the only way he could come. And now, shit would. I think I killed him, brother. - Maybe he's just unconscious. Oh, be safe. Oh. - Oh! - You guys thought I was totally fucking dead. - All right, how is this funny? I'm shaking. - Was it believable? - Oh you are unbelievable, baby. - I should be on fucking Broadway. - I thought you were dead. Tell him, Sean. I was tweaking like a fucking wildebeest. - Jesus Christ, don't be so fucking dramatic. - You guys are killing me. - What are you doing? - Some of us have to get up in the morning for our real jobs. - Why don't you just stay, it's late. - 'Cause I can't spend another second in this college dorm room. - What do you think, I like living like this? - So do something about it! - I'm trying. - It's always the same story with you. - What does that mean? - It means if you don't like living like a 33 year old man child, it's probably time you got a real fucking job! I mean you have a hamster! - What, I can't have a hamster? I could have a dog, a cat, but I can't have a hamster? - You aren't any good! If you haven't made it by now, you're never gonna make it. I'm just saving you years of heartache. Someone should have told you this already. I'm sorry, but it's true. - Hey mate. Do you guys just mind keeping it down a little bit in here? Richie's in there meditating. Getting ready for round two. Fuck me, I don't know if I have it in me. Thanks. - No, no, no, no. - Hi, Sean, it's mom. Listen, I have a question for you, would you call me back, love you. - One. A, A, A, A, A. I, I. - Let's fucking rob this bank. - Oh. - Go, go, go! - I mean how could you possibly think? I say end on a good one. - Oh fuck, I'm late for fucking class again. Sorry, I'm sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. - Ah, Freddy, you're perfecting the art of being the last one out of your trailer and on the set. Okay, let's go, who's first? - I'm sorry. - Why, why, why, why did you do that to me? - Yeah that's stupid! - 10 bucks he argues his critique. I don't have 10 bucks but it's a figure of speech. - Yeah I get it. - Because I made one stupid mistake? I'm sorry! I'm sorry. - Good. It's good. - Thank you. - It's pretty good, huh? - Mhmm. - What about you? What were you doing? - Well I knew that the subtext of the scene was betrayal. - Subtext, has anyone ever heard me use the term subtext in this classroom? - I mean I just thought that my character-- - Would you just shut up for a while and listen? - You wanna grab a beer? - I can't man, I gotta get a trim. I gotta audition against some 24 year olds tomorrow. - Come on, man. - I have to. - Meet me after? - Yeah, for sure. - I gotta get one before work. - All right, let's do it. - Hey, Sean, how are you? You wanna what? - Come by the office. - No, no, no. Look kid, I am super busy right now. I'm all jammed up over here. Hey, hey, I'll be right there. Tell him I'll be right there, okay? - Okay, what about next week? I could come in next week. - Next week? No, look, I tell you what. How about a month, month and a half? I'll put you in the books and we can get you going. - Are you in the office right now? - Of course I'm in the office. What are you kidding me? - Well I just thought that it would be cool if we're gonna work together, maybe we should, I don't know, get to know one another? - You got a lot of integrity. Not too many people out here are like that. I'll take care of you, I'll get back to you in about two months. - All right. - Jesus Christ, this guy. I wish you'd just leave me alone. - I can't believe he got a show. - The guy in class? - Mhmm. - Got on a show? - Yeah. - Are you kidding me? I'm gonna kill myself. - All right, what's your deal? - What? - You sound a little more suicidal than usual. - Nothing, I'm fine. All right I kind of got into this little thing with Becky last night. - Oh here we go. Gotta admit, man, never liked her. - Never liked her? - Never. - Really? - Yeah. - 'Cause I'm pretty sure the second you saw her you told me you were in love with her. - I never said that. - Yes you did. You know what, just forget I brought it up. - Listen man, I'm sure she's super sexy and all. I've jerked off her like a zillion times but she is crazy. - Why are you jerking off to my girlfriend? - You know, you guys fight all the time. And you never stand up for yourself man, you gotta have some backbone. - Just stop, all right? It's fine. - Listen man, I'm your best friend so I have to say this. So here it goes. You guys aren't good for each other. No one likes her. She likes Instagram more than she likes you. - Come on, she doesn't like Instagram more than me. Does she? Does she care more about? - Obviously. - Oh, this is stupid, forget it. You know what, it wasn't even me. It was my roommate. - What did he do? - He's crazy. He went into the bedroom and he was choking out and tazing his boyfriend while they were having sex. And then one of them pretends he's dead. It sounds a lot worse. It was a stupid joke. - Where'd you find this guy? - Online. I can't afford my own place. Unless you want me to move in with you and your mom. - Yeah that's probably not gonna work. Her boyfriend already wants me out. You believe that? - Kind of. What happened with your agent, you hear anything? - No, haven't heard anything yet. - It's all right man, it'll happen. - Whatever, dude. At this point I don't even care. - Oh, all right. Let's get out of here, I gotta go to work. - Ooh, serving sliders to debutantes, how nice. - Some of us pay rent, right? We can't all live with mommy. - That's fucked up, man. I chip in. - Do you? - I chip in! - You don't chip in. - I chip in. - Sean. What's up, man? - Hey. What's up, Ethan? - Just upsold table 22 on a bottle of Perrier Jouet Vintage. - Oh good, wow, that's great. - Just took my som test, nailed it. Already paying off clearly. Don't worry about it, man. You'll get there one day. Come on, let's get out there. - Not worried about it, Ethan. - Great, yeah, I don't really like-- - Ladies, crazy salad skewers with a balsamic reduction? - Is it organic? - I don't believe so. - Is there a GMO in it? - No. - Is it local? - Yes, it is local. - It's local. - Vegan cheese? - No, it's real, real actual cheese. Okay, well. - I can't, sorry. - What's that? - What do I do with this? - I don't know. Can, yeah. - All right, did you eat it? - Sorry. - Hi, is there a problem with the skewers? - They're not organic. - They're not for us. - Yeah, understood. Sean, can I have a word with you please? Excuse us. - I need a napkin. I feel like it's just on my face. - Let's just go. - Yeah please. - What's going on with you, Sean? Listen, I've been watching you and I can't help but notice that you're not chipping in. - I think I chip in all the time. - Okay, well great, I'm not gonna argue with you, okay? Because I'm not a micromanager, it's not my style. But when everyone else on staff is kicking it into high gear, you're not. - Okay. - Good, good, great. So that means I'm not gonna have to write you up 'cause I don't wanna do that 'cause we got better things to do like work and stuff? - I'm sorry, now do you have some kind of a personal problem with me? - Personal problem, no. Sounds like HR stuff, okay? This is strictly business. - All right, whatever you say. - There you go, exactly, whatever I say. You said it, not me, good. - Should I go back to work? - Yeah, you should go back to work or whatever. Better than work, whatever you aren't doing. Do it better. - Yeah. - Actually Sean, one last thing. I noticed you've been putting your silverware on granite plates. They need to be on marble plates. - Okay, no problem. - And Sean, if you could button up your top button, that'd be great, all right? - Okay. - And let's look sharp. Look good, feel good, right? - Okay. - Good. - Other than that, we're all good, right? - Yeah, okay. - Good, okay. If I notice anything else I'll come get you. - I know you will. - Keep your head on a swivel. Okay. - Please do not hang up. Your wireless account is currently suspended for non payment. Please stay on the line while we transfer you to our financial service. - What happened to you, man? I thought you were gonna text me when you get out of work. - I know, yeah, I'm sorry. My phone, I have shitty service over there. - Did you pay your bill? - Yeah, I paid my bill. - Closing in five minutes, fellas. - Oh come on dude, we just got a pitcher, man. We're celebrating! Oh come on. - Celebrating, what are we celebrating? - So what's new? - What's new? What's new, what's new with you? I don't know, nothing's new. Are you gonna look at me, or are you just-- - I'm sorry, now, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm blowing up right now. Give me a second. - Yeah, awesome. All right, what's going on? - Dude, you're not gonna believe this. I booked that show. - You booked it, what? Why didn't you tell me you booked it? - I'm telling you now. Crazy, right? - Yeah I mean, when did it happen? - They called me today. I can't believe it, man. Series regular, Life Behind Bars, season two, me. I mean I've been busting my ass for this, man. You know I was busting my ass for this. - Congrats, man. I'm happy for you, bro. Happy for you. So what happens now? - We start shooting next week. - Next week? That's like, it's fast, right? - Yeah but like they shot last season so it's all set up. Once I get up there and I get situated, you gotta come up and visit, man. Meet the cast, it'll be so cool. - Yeah, of course man, I'll come up. - Oh. Dude, it's my mom. I haven't told her yet. I'll be right back. Mom, it's Freddy. Your son. You called me, remember? - Jimmy, stop it. Oh, Jimmy. Jimmy! - Look, I don't know why you're freaking out. Okay, nobody likes their roommate. Besides, you can always move back in with mom and dad. - Ugh, I'd rather live in a tent. - Stop being ridiculous. - Where's Lena? - She's at school. - D, she's looking at me kind of funny. I don't know if she likes me very much. - Don't be silly. Her brain hasn't even developed the sensations between love and hate yet so you're fine. - Hate? Who said hate, I didn't say hate. - You know what I mean. - Oh my god, she hates me, I knew it. You know what, babies they can sense that shit. - Hey, watch your language. Look, if you really wanna do this you need to put it out there in the universe that you are gonna be successful. Okay, that's what I've always done and it's worked for me. Look, I have two beautiful daughters and I have a loving husband who just came home. Hi babe. - Hey babe. - Hey. What's up David, how you doing, man? - Jeez, you could hug your brother-in-law, for God's sakes. Hi babe. - Hey. How's that, - Acting? - Right, yeah. - It's good. I had a couple of things last week and trying to get some stuff going on. - Oh good, I'll be inside. Working. - What? - What's with this guy? He can't give me a hug, a handshake? - David's been really stressed at work. - Yeah I'm sure. - So were you gonna go see Freddy tonight? I miss Freddy, he's like my buddy. - Yeah, don't we all? I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't go. - Why not? - It's like his show, you know. And it's new and it might be weird, maybe. - Don't go if it's gonna upset you. - It's not gonna upset me. Why would it upset me? - Sean. - Okay fine, I'm going, he's all excited anyway. Hey, I'm gonna go see Uncle Freddy on TV. Your older sister loves me. I'm gonna kiss you anyway 'cause I love you. Mwah, I love you. - Bye. - Yeah. - Hey you know you can always stay in our guesthouse if you need. - I'm sure David would love that. Nope, I'm gonna go to Skid Row, my people. Hey, excuse me. I'm supposed to meet my friend here, he's on the show. - What's your name? - Sean, Sean Reilly. - Yeah. I have got a Sean Reilly here for-- - Oh you know what, you don't have to do that. You know what, I'm gonna call him. That's what I'll do. - No, it's all right. Let me see if I can figure this out. - You know what, I'll probably text him. I don't wanna bother him. Probably makes more sense that way anyway. - You ever been here before? - No. - Yo, Sean! - Oh, what's up? - What's up, man? - Looks like we found him. - Yes we did. - All right, well nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you too, thank you. - Yo, you made it, dude, come on. - Yeah dude, this is awesome. - I know, totally bananas, man. Yo, what's up Ahmir? - Ah, what's going on, my brother? - How you doing, good to see you. Ahmir, this is my boy Sean. - Hey Sean. - Sean, this is Ahmir. He's one of the regulars on the show. - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, shit, I forgot my phone. I'll be right back guys, give me one second. - All right, man. - So, you like writer's assistant or, how does that? - I'm staff. I'm a series regular on the show. - Oh, that's cool. I didn't mean anything by it. You look so young, it's awesome. - Yeah, you just meant that I look so young that I probably can't read or write, is that what you're saying? Like a black man can't read or write or be on TV? - No, no, man, I didn't mean anything like that at all. - Ha! - God. - I'm just, it's all good, man. - What up? - What up? Sean, this is Jane. - Nice to meet you. - Hey, nice to meet you too. God, you're so cute. - Thanks. - Jane was on the show for four years. - Oh yeah, but I was only three. I figure it doesn't count if you don't remember it, right? - Right, yup. I say right too. - So what do you do? - Me, oh I don't know. I do a lot of different things. - Sean's an actor too. - Sweet, what are you working on? - I did a play not too long ago. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, it's you know. - That sucks. - It's a play. - Yikes. A play. - Yo. - Yeah? - Do you know who that is? - Well. - He was nominated for an Oscar, Love Story? You're an actor, you should know this. - Yeah I know who it is, man. He's the guest star on our show. You wanna come meet him? - No, dude. I've never been this close to a celebrity before. I wouldn't even know what to say. - Stop, come on man, let's go. - I said "Why are you following me?", he says "Because I know who you are." I said "You do, who am I?" He said "You're Allie McGraw." And you know I thought he was joking and then I realized no he's not joking. He thinks I'm Allie McGraw. - Oh no. - And I'm not, you know. - No, you're not. - I lived. - Hey, how you doing? - Hi. - Allie, I'm Freddy, nice to meet you. - Oh. Oh, that's funny. - Freddy is one of our new cast members. - Nice to meet you. This is my buddy Sean, too. - Hey, Mr. O'neal, very nice to meet you. - Thank you, Sean. - I know who you are. Not in a weird or stalker way, just like-- - No, no ,no. - I'm a big fan, I wanted to say, you know. - I appreciate that, thank you. Well you should stick around. - Well I'm gonna get him out of here right now but it was nice to meet you guys. - Okay, you too. Take care now. - Good luck today. - Oh, I gotta introduce you to Bradley Mason Weatherman, dude. - Is that like a real name, or? - Yeah dude, he's the shit. Yo Bradley, what's up, man? - Hey, what's up, man? - How you doing? - Good, man, how you doing? Here baby, here, come on, trust me. There you go. - Yo, this is Sean. - Yo, Steve, what's up player? - Sean. - Oh Sean, my bad, my bad. Yeah, thanks man. - Bradley's great grandfather is like Hollywood royalty. Basically developed and made all the studios. - Oh dude, come on. - He's being modest. - Okay, 75 percent. Yeah dude we're gonna have drinks at my place. You should come by sometime, you know. I'm just, for Freddy being part of the show. You know, he's family now, so. - Not the real family. You know, like the TV family maybe or like, not like real. You know, not real, real family love. - What? - Oh shit dude. I'm sorry, I gotta go. I got this clinger coming at me, dude. She's all over my nut sack, right? She's like an Indiana five but thinks she's a Hollywood 10, you know. But she's gonna come pick me up. She's got some fancy car. I think it's her dad's car. Actually I think she's gonna Uber but who gives a shit, I'm gonna go anyways. I'll see you guys in a little bit, huh? - Take it easy. That guy's a trip. - Actually he talks a lot. - Well he's crazy, man. What, you don't like him? - I have a famous family. I don't have to work for anything in my fucking life. Oh, I can't even act but I'm on a fucking show! - Hey, not allowed in here. - Sorry. I'm leaving. Just don't call the cops. - Get the fuck out. - No. - Yo, yo. - What's up? - Hey, how are you man? - What's up, you fucking devil? Get this, have his drink. - Come on, it's Tuesday night, man. - What's wrong with you, man? - No I'm not gonna drink. I'm gonna go to bed. - I don't take my clothes off. I just do the webcam thing with my underwear on which is like a bathing suit. And I have a rule. I don't say the word baby and I don't touch myself because I think that's kind of nasty and a little bit narcissistic. - But that's your job, that's what you do for money? - Yeah. I mean it pays really good actually. But I'm trying to get out of it 'cause I wanna pursue what I, you know, what I came out here to do. - And what's that? - Well, I have two real passions in life. I wanna be a writer or a lion tamer. - You wanna be a lion tamer? - Yes. - Like in the circus? - Yeah, like the circus. - Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean! - Does anybody have a credit card? - Wait. - Look, I know you don't really know us. We don't frankly know you that well either. But we didn't take your fucking bag, okay? - Everyone needs to check their pockets one more time. - Pockets then, let me check them. I don't have it. - Can you check Peruvian Gary Coleman's fucking pockets please? - He did already, that's not fucking funny. - It is funny. - Everywhere, I don't know what the fuck-- - Fine. - We have our bag of blow. They lost their bag of blow. This crazy chick thinks I fucking stole her blow. - Man this fucking guard, he's drunk. He hasn't checked his pockets, man. It's in them, no one else took it. - He fucking has it. Go check his fucking pockets. Someone check his fucking pockets. Unbelievable, this is fucking stupid. - You're unbelievable. - You're a fucking buzzkill. - I'm not playing around! Give me the bag! - What the fuck? - Whoah, whoah, whoah. Dee, Dee, Dee, Dee, Dee! Put the gun down man. Put the fucking piece down, brother. - It's fake, it's fake. - Put it down, it's not real. It's a fake BB gun. - It's a fake gun. - Put it down, put it down. - That's not fucking funny. - Ah, you wanted to see me, come in. - Yes. - What's on your mind? - I was kind of wondering. Am I doing okay in class? - Yeah. You're doing fine. - It's just I was wondering if I should be progressing at a faster speed. Maybe I'm not on track? - You let me worry about that. You just worry about the work. - I know. - Everyone is different, Sean. There's no rush. Trust me, this is a lifelong journey. Stay committed, you'll be fine. - It's just I wanna do better and I think I could do better and I'm used to like a little bit more of a player-coach relationship, so if, maybe I need to be pushed a little harder. - Oh I see. So you need me to coddle you like a child. - No. No, Arthur, I didn't mean it like that. - Do the work, Sean, focus. Single most important thing in your life, focus on your journey. Focus. Okay. - Hey, sorry I'm late. - Oh. Class, this is our new student, Annie. Annie, class. Have a seat. Let's go. - And you're from Long Island? - I am, so are you, yeah. - And where are you from, what town? - This small town East Meadow. - I'm from Bellmore. - Really? - Yeah. - Nobody says that, wow, small world. - Where did you go to high school? - I went to a Catholic school, St. Matthews. - Oh so you probably know my brother. - I don't know, what year did he graduate? - Oh, he didn't go there. He went to Holy Cross, it's all boys. - Oh yeah, I know of Holy Cross. I knew a couple guys but no, it's been a while. You wanna sit? - Yeah, I wanted to ask you. Did you play hockey by any chance? - Yeah, a little bit. - You're Sean Reilly. You definitely know my brother, Rohan Sullivan. - Oh my god, you're Rohan's little sister? I mean I didn't know him that well. Like we played against each other all the time growing up but I didn't hang out with him. - Yeah he hated you. Specially after you beat him in that scoring record thing. - You knew about that? - Oh yeah, he wouldn't let it go for months. He was pissed. My dad too, ugh. I used to go to all his games. And what happened to you? Do you still play? - No. What about you, I mean, you are on set and then you show up at my acting class. Are you like stalking me? - You wish. - Maybe. - I'm just kidding. I work as a PA part time, basically filling in whenever they call me. Then I work for a retail store on the weekends and now I'm taking class which you obviously know. And okay I will stop talking now. - No, please, keep going, keep going. - No, I think that's it. - You gotta be kidding me. - Nine a.m. on set, 12 p.m magazine interview. Hashtag winning! - So happy my friends flew. - Finally got to marry the man of my dreams. Feeling so hashtag blessed. Hashtag can't wait, hashtag. - I hate everyone! Micky. Micky! - Yo, what's up, mate? - You drank my orange juice again. - No I didn't. - Well, we're the only two people that live here. - And Richie. - Richie doesn't live here. - Well he's not technically on the lease, but you know. I don't know mate. I don't know what to tell you, I didn't drink it. - Okay, well I didn't drink it so who did? - I don't bloody know. But there was a couple people over here the other night. Maybe it was the guy that slept in your bed. - So someone slept in my bed, who? - Fuck me, I didn't know him. - Why didn't you know him? - Well he wasn't a friend of mine. We met him at a gig Richie and I did. You know he was a bit of a prick if you ask me. - Then why was he sleeping in my bed, Micky? - I guess he was tired? - Okay, new rule. No one sleeps in my bed but me. And no more using my computer, okay? It's my computer. - But I can't use my own computer, mate. I got all my music on there. I can't jeopardize the music. - Well I'm sorry, you're gonna have to figure it out. - It's not gonna work. Richie, he doesn't want me to mix business with pleasure. - Well, try to figure out some other business pleasure situation. - Sean, I can't risk tossing off on my own computer. - Well you're gonna have to toss off on something else, okay? I'm sorry, it's my computer, that's it, mine. - Richie's not gonna be happy. - This is good. What up? - Yo, finally.

You're strapped. - Is this good? - Oh shut up! - I love you. - Oh, more fucking than talking. - Right, it's just that you look so beautiful up there. - Oh god, your dick feels so good. - I'm glad we didn't have trouble in the sex department. - Oh, no we did not. - Definitely helps in the makeup process. - Oh, we're not making up. - Oh god, it feels like we are to me. - No, no, this isn't makeup sex, this is breakup sex. - What? - Oh god. - Did you just break up with me while I was inside of you? - Oh I'm so close! - Circles around her. Oh my god. He thinks that he prepared for this. You know I could have gone out last Friday. The boys were going out. And I said no, I gotta practice for this stupid ass expensive ass class! - Sean? - Give me a freaking break. You know and he was just so, he thinks he just knows everything! - Yeah. Hi. - Annie! - Are you okay? - Oh my god, Annie. Are you following me? No, I'm having a dream. Oh my god, I'm so happy to see you. I'm having such a bad dream right now. - I don't think you're dreaming right now. - No, no because you're always, you're showing up everywhere and it's a dream. Everybody, it's a dream, bad dream, no need to worry about it. - Shush. - Just a dream. - So that's the acting studio and I just came from rehearsal. - What if it's a dream within a dream within another dream? I'm in a dream. - Why don't we go get you another drink? - Another drink? - Yeah. - Let's get another drink. Oh, thank you. Ugh. This doesn't have any alcohol in it. - I think you've had enough for one night. - So this is your place of employment huh? It's nice, it's cozy. - Yeah, it's okay. It has its perks, I guess. So what happened? - Let's just say I went in as her boyfriend but I didn't come back out the same way. - Oh, that's maybe too much information for me. - Yeah she broke up with me while I was inside of her. Like mid inside lay, fuck. - Wait, while you guys were having sex. - During. - Mid? Inside. - Inside. You got it. - Wow. I can honestly say you're the first person I've ever met who got broken up with like that. - Thanks. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be insensitive. - It's silly. It's my life, it's just silly. Can I ask you something? - Only if you tell me why you're wearing those awful looking shoes. - You don't like them? - Why do you own those? - I don't. But they're my dancing shoes. - Please stop. - Who has three names? Bradley Mason Weatherman? - That can't be his real name. - Apparently it is. Oh my god. Am I a terrible friend? - No, you're not. It must be hard to watch your best friend go through that. Come on, your best friend is on a TV show. You should be excited and happy for him. It doesn't happen everyday. And it isn't gonna last forever. I'm sorry, I have to go. - It's okay. - I have to wake up really early tomorrow. Sure you don't want a ride? - No, I'm okay, I'm good.

You sure you're cool with that? - Yeah, yeah, it's cool. - Why don't you switch with someone so you can hang out with us, man? It'll be fun. - You know what, dude, I really need the money now so I'm just gonna work it. - All right man. Just sucks you can't hang out. - I know, but it's not a big deal, so. - Okay. What's wrong man, are you sick? - What? - Are you sick? - No, I'm just, had a rough night. - I thought you went home. - Yeah that was the plan, and then you know some unexpected things happened. - You saw Becky, dude. - No. - You did. - No. Okay yeah, but don't get mad, look. - Dude, you're unbelievable, man. - It's not what you think. - Would it have killed you to hang out? Would it have killed you? I invited you out with my friends. Would it have killed you to hang out with us? You lied to me man, for nothing, for her! - I was trying to fix shit, okay, and then she broke up with me. - Whatever, man. - All right? - Whatever dude, I gotta work. - Well come on Freddy, stop. - Bullshit. - Freddy!

If you had to go. - Do you want me to go? - No, no, I just mean, like I mean if you wanted to go home and get a good night's sleep in your own bed, I would totally understand. - I can just go to work from here, I'm cool. - Okay. Cool. - Are you cool? - Yeah, totally, yeah. Why wouldn't I be cool? - Sean, honey, hi, listen. Some bank called here. Not sure if it's a scam or not. Do you have any outstanding credit cards? Anyway, call me back. Love you, bye bye. - Hey, you've reached Freddy. I can't come to the phone right now 'cause I'm sleeping! - Hey, what's up, it's me. I'm just checking in. Haven't heard from you in a little while. Just wanted to see how you're doing. I know you're busy with the show and everything and you got a lot going on, so, but, I did wanna say I'm sorry about the other day. That was stupid, I was hungover and just being an idiot, so. But I also met someone and she works on your show so that's kind of why I'm calling too 'cause I want you to know. Just getting everything out there in the open. Yeah, so I don't know, dude. Give me a call when you can, all right. - I don't understand why we have to baby around. - Fuck Richie, we just need to tell him. - Okay fine, tell him, I don't care. - Sean, can you come in here? - Look, I just wanna talk about the backstage with all LEDs. - We talked about the LED lights. Are we talking about me coming down onto the stage, we're already there. - That's fine. Just gotta dial it in. - Well dial it in, man. - Have you talked to Sam Poncho? - Sam Poncho knows. - What's up? - Well, we're hitched to fit, mate. - I don't know what that means. - We're gonna do it man, the whole bloody thing. Ring, the church, moon in the honey. - The honeymoon. - We're gonna do it all, babe. - So you guys are getting married? - Well you're focusing on the wrong thing. - Just the minor details, 'cause really it's all part of the whole travel plan. - Oh. You guys are gonna kill me. I would love to be in your wedding, just, this isn't a good time for me right now. I got a lot of stuff going on. - Yeah, about that. - We actually are just, - We're gonna keep it like more friends and family. - It's kind of a smaller gathering. - 'Cause it'll only be fair. We have so many friends and we have to invite everybody and my aunt Martha would wanna come and it's just, I don't know. - Okay so what are you saying? - You know when our Soundcloud went through the fucking roof? - Two million views our first week. - So we signed new management and we're actually gonna be opening at Tomorrowland. - Belgium! - Germany. - Switzerland. Where else are we going? - Southeast Asia. - Oh I love sushi. - Wait, Micky, I don't understand. - I can't fucking believe it either. Just, I feel like I'm dreaming. But hard work, it seems like it pays off. - I am so happy that we kept that original hook. - When the fucking side chain kicks in. ¶ Are you dancing next to ¶ ¶ Are you dancing next to ¶ ¶ Are you dancing next to ¶ ¶ Are you dancing next to ¶ - Micky, Micky, Micky, Micky. We have a lease, Micky. - Look, it's just month to month. - No, it's not month to month 'cause you don't even really live here. - Well actually, technically, no one lives here anymore. - Technically. - Micky, you can't. You gotta give me notice. I mean you can't just drop this on me like-- - Well mate, life, love, it just kind of happens. It just drops in. That's the way it goes. - Yeah it'll all work itself out. Look, we've already taken care of the lease. You have till the end of the month. - It's the end of the month, guys. It is the end of the month. - Oh right, 'cause I had my colonic on the 23rd, right, yeah, you're right. - We love you, Sean. - No you don't. No. - Hey. It's me again. Look, I don't know what happened to you. I hope I didn't scare you off. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gotten you those hockey tickets. I didn't mean to push it on you. Thought it might help. Well, I don't know what else to say. I wish you could talk about this. So call me if you want or don't. And if you don't then I'll take the hint. I'll just see you in class then or something. Okay, I'll stop annoying you now. Bye. - Who? - It's Ben. - It's Ben. Of course it is. - That's it? - I thought we were only supposed to take it to that point. - Why on earth would you think that? - Well that's what everyone else is doing. - Everyone here needs to get serious. This is it, we're coming into the home stretch and I'm not gonna be here forever to tell you to finish your goddamn scene! You should know better. You should know better! I expect more from you! Why didn't you finish the scene? This is unacceptable. In class and in life. Now get me someone up here who wants to work. Now. - Hey. Hey. - What? - I just wanted to see if you're okay. I tried calling you. - I'm fine. - Sorry, I just thought that-- - Well you thought wrong. I don't need you checking in on me or getting me to like hockey again or whatever it is you're doing, okay? - What are you talking about? I was just trying to help you. - Well don't. - I thought something was there. - It's not, okay? I'm sorry. - I don't understand. Why are you doing this? - I'm not doing anything, okay? I shouldn't have strung you along. I'm sorry, it's just not working, all right? Don't make me feel bad about it. Please. It's official. My life's over. - No it's not. - Yeah it is. It's okay, you know what? I want it to be over. - You know things could be worse. You could be moving back to New York. - Yeah that's true. Thanks. - Hungry? Is this your suitcase? - Yeah. Please. - Hi baby. - Oh, you told mom? - Yeah, she was worried about you. - Honey, look, I know that I usually come just on your birthday, but, I'm gonna stay as long as you need for me to stay while you get your shit together. - All your shit together. - Great. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Oh we're gonna have so much fun. - I'm just gonna get set up over there. You guys keep, no I'm exciting. - Where are you going? Where are you going, no, no, I have things to tell you. - Hey Sean, Gary here. So it looks like they're not gonna go any further with you with that audition. They said that you did a good job but they found somebody much better. All right? Just keep your head up kid, keep doing what you're doing. Talk to you soon. ¶ They say this city's made of gold ¶ ¶ But I don't buy that anymore ¶ ¶ I'd say you're getting pretty old ¶ ¶ To keep banging on every door ¶ ¶ All my friends are doing good things ¶ ¶ Sad to see them on the big screen ¶ - Too many buttons. Where's the dimmer, what's this? Come on. Jesus. Fuck. Jimmy. How you doing, buddy? Jimmy? Bud. Jimmy, come on. Can I get you some champagne, sir? - Come on Sean, really? - Well, I mean come on dude. I didn't know if you're still mad at me or remember what I looked like. - I'm not mad at you. - You sure? I mean you don't call, you don't write, you don't text. - I know man, I'm super sorry about that. I've just been like so busy with the show. There's all this press stuff. It's just a lot, man. I'm sorry, but we gotta hang though. - Yeah, no, that makes sense. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Are we good? - Yeah, yeah, always, man. - Cool. - Sorry, I just. - No, it's fine. - I'm losing it a little, you know. - Hey guys. How you doing? - Uh, good. - You have a good time? - Yeah. - Good, good, good, I'm glad, glad to hear it. Can I borrow you for a sec? - Sure, yeah. Yes? - What the hell do you think you're doing? - I'm passing champagne, Ned. - No, no schmoozing with the guest. You were literally hugging him. It's a strict violation of the employee handbook. You know that. - Look. - Hey man, table seven is pissed, man. They haven't gotten their drinks yet. - Really? - Don't worry, I took care of it for you, okay? - Thank you. - Wow. - Thank you for that. - Top notch here, huh? - All right, Ned, look. He's my best friend, okay? I've known him since grammar school. - I don't care, not tonight. You're an employee, he's a guest, okay? I'm gonna have to write you up for this. - Are you fucking kidding me, Ned? - Oh wow. I'm gonna pretend that I didn't hear that or else I'd have to write you up for insubordination too. Do you understand that? - Yeah. - Are we clear? - Yeah. - Are we clear? - Clear, Ned. - Good. - Yes, thank you, thank you. We're very excited. So you know I've seen a lot of shows in my day. And I can say with confidence that this group is very, very special. And I would like to begin with someone who needs no introduction. Bradley Mason Weatherman, everybody. Yes. So Bradley. I know that your career has spanned many many shows at this point. - Yeah. - What would you say makes this show different? - Oh wow, throw me a tough question right out of the gate. Well first of all I'd like to just say thank you to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. If it weren't for him, I don't know where I'd be. Respect to these guys, this cast and crew was one of a kind. Maybe one of the best I've ever worked with. - Speaking of the amazing cast, I know you have a new member now, Freddy James. So tell me about Freddy. What has he brought to the table? - Well one, quick-witted. And just look at that smile, he's charming and that's the sweetest character on the show. And charming funny dude. And I think with all the hard work that we've put in, it's his birthday. We haven't even acknowledged his birthday. - Happy birthday Freddy, wow. - And since he's done such an amazing job, I decided to, well I heard you're a huge music fan. So I decided to go out and get two VIP tickets to Coachella and they're gonna helicopter us in, it's catered, no it's paid for, it's gonna be great. Yes, happy birthday my man. Happy birthday. - True friends are great in life. To friendship. - Sure is. My pleasure, yeah. - Are you kidding me dude, I told you that. That was my idea! - Oh we don't need drinks dude, we're good. - Sean. - You are a conniving little prick, are you serious? - Sean. - What? - Stop. - Stop? Stop what? Stop pretending that this pretty boy isn't a complete overacting douche bag? That he hasn't had to work for anything in his precious little life? - Sean, what is wrong? - What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? Look around you, Freddy. Are you kidding me? Do you even know any of these people? Have you seen a group of more self-righteous assholes on the entire planet? Am I losing my mind? - Sean. - Let me tell everybody something about Mr. Bradley Mason Weatherman. Mr. Tan. - Sean! - What? - What are you doing? - Ned, fuck off. - You're fired. You're fired. - That's a surprise. No, don't take my microphone. Don't take my microphone, it's my microphone. - Come on, give me the microphone. - No, no! You're not getting my microphone! Well guys, that's all the time I have for tonight. Thank you. - Really? Yo Sean, fuck you. - Really! - Are you okay? - Dude, I'm so sorry bro. - Is it bad? ¶ Can't watch this jealousy oh ¶ ¶ Don't want me happy ¶ ¶ Just won't be mean ¶ ¶ Our friends are already enemies ¶ ¶ Made sure I weep ¶ ¶ I just wanna be free ¶ - Oh, hey David, good morning. - Why is it that your sister continues to support you with my money? - Oh, I know. But, no technically, I don't think I'm costing you any more money 'cause, I mean the couch is here already so I'm just, you know I'm just sleeping on it. David, I'm really grateful that you're letting me stay here. I know it's, - Right. - Not easy to. But I'm happy to have a brother-in-law that loves me. 'Cause you're so perfect! - Sean! - What? - What the hell do you think you're doing? - Ned, fuck off. - Sean. - You know, you're fired! - That wasn't good. Well guys, that's all the time I have for tonight. - Can I have my iPad back? - Oh god, what is that? Sean. Sean, what the hell is this? This is like a meth den in here. It smells like urine or something from that Breaking Bad show. Oh god, this is exactly how it starts. Sean, would you wake up? This is not okay! - No, mom, could you not do that? - You cannot sleep! It's two p.m. in the afternoon for God's sakes. What are you doing, are you on drugs? - Mom, I'm not on drugs. - Yes, yes you are on drugs. - Mom, I'm not on, - Did you take quelutes? - Mom, I'm not on drugs. - Did you take some Mary Jo? - What? - What is it that you took? - Mary Jo? - 'Cause this is so not you. I am not gonna have my granddaughter around a druggie, do you understand that? - Mom. - Not for a second. All right. This is what's gonna happen. You're gonna get up and you're gonna take a shower and I am going to fix you something to eat, okay? - Mom, I don't wanna eat. - Oh yes you are gonna eat. - I already ate! - And you're gonna eat what I give you, do you understand? Not this crap. And if you wanna throw it up then you throw it up. And I don't know what you're doing with this. That looks like a big druggie item right here. Lots of liquid. What do they have in here, cocaine? - Ma, it's bubbles. - No it's not. I'm taking this. That is disgusting, that's all I can say. I don't even know what's in here, all right. So I want all of this to be fixed in 10 minutes. Do you hear me? Wash your face, your hair, and down there. Happy birthday, sweety. - Mom, who's gonna eat all this cake? - Well we'll give some to the neighbors. - The neighbors don't want my leftover birthday cake. - Why wouldn't they want your leftover birthday cake? It's sweets, it's sugar, they love cake. - Mom, this is embarrassing. I'm too old for this. - No you're not. You're the perfect age. - Mom, I'm 30 years old, this is stupid. - You're not 30, you're 34. Pretty sure you're 34. Look it, I wrote happy 34th birthday. Come on, I know you're 34. - Thanks for reminding me. - What's going on, Sean boy? - I don't know, mom, I don't know. You know, I have no job, I have no girlfriend. I have no best friend, I have no place to live. I have no career, no purpose in life. You know mom, just the usual stuff. - So you're gonna feel sorry for yourself, aren't you? - Why can't you ever just tell me you understand? Why don't you just say "Sean, you know what, "this really sucks." - You know why, because it's not gonna make a difference. It's not gonna change anything, Sean. - Just lie to me, mom. Just tell me the world sucks and everything's gonna be okay or something. - Sean. We live in America. Do you know how lucky we are we don't live in some third world country where people wake up and they don't know if they're gonna eat or what they're gonna eat or if it's gonna make them sick and diseased? They don't have any shoes, no running water, no healthcare. Can you imagine? Look at what you have, we've got family. We've got so many wonderful people in our lives. And we love you very much even if you don't always love us. Your father and I, do you think that being married to him all these years has been easy? It hasn't. No, we've had our ups and downs, Sean. We don't tell you kids everything but we stuck through it because we know how important it is and we know how much we loved each other. One of us did stray though. - Mom, what? - I'm not gonna say who it is. - No, don't tell me that. - I am not, I'm just saying that it wasn't that easy. I'm trying to make a point. So there. Look, make a wish, blow out the candles and let's have some birthday cake. Come here, I love you. - I love you too. - You will always be my baby. And mommy's gonna be here. - I know. - No matter how old you get your mother's always gonna be here to take care of you. All right, make a wish, come on. ¶ Happy birthday ¶ ¶ Happy Freddy ¶ - Hey dude, haven't talked to you, obviously. You know that. I guess we're just not talking anymore. So just wanna call and say happy birthday to you. - Sean, it's Dana and I need you to call me back. I need to talk to you, okay, it's important, call me back. It was when he went in the shower. He left his phone on the counter. And it was unlocked. And his texts are like blowing up. I'm like, go over and see who it is, like it might be work or something important. - Okay? - It's like disgusting. It was like some whore from his work. And I'm like scrolling up like the phone and it's like his dick and like dick pics and like videos of him jerking off. - What? - Like just so gross. - Oh god. - I'm just like, how do you do that to someone? - I'm sorry. - It's so bad. - Hey, you have to go. - What time is it? - Six a.m. - Then why are you waking me up? - Because I've got a nail appointment before work and I can't be late. Can we go now? - Okay. Ugh, god. Oh god, couldn't you just let me sleep a little longer? - Excuse me? You do realize that I let you stay here, I'm not happy about it either, trust me. - I'm just a little hung over. It's my birthday, you can cut me some slack, you know. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. - Now, be happy, say thank you, take the coffee and go. - No. - No? - No. - No what? - I have let you emotionally abuse me for way too long. - Emotionally abuse you? You're such a pussy. - I don't need this shit. I don't need you. You think because you're beautiful you get away with whatever you want? You could treat people bad to make yourself feel better? What, you have 100,000 Instagram followers, it's pathetic, okay? 'Cause I know the truth. You don't have any girlfriends, why do you think that is? And the only guy friends you have they just wanna fuck you. Come to think of it, it's probably the only thing that you're good at. Fucking out of here. - Hey it's Annie. Can't get to the phone right now. Leave a message. - Annie, it's Sean. Call me back. - Hi Sean, it's your mom. Oh gosh it is just raining cats and dogs here. Anyway, call me back. - Hey Annie, it's Sean, gimme a call when you get a chance. - That may have been your best work so far. Nice job, well done. - Annie, it's Sean again, call me back. Call me back, call me back, call me back. I couldn't help but notice that every time I call you it goes right to voice mail. - Oh my gosh, why do you think that is? - I don't know. I would think you were maybe ignoring me. Come on, let me make it up to you. - Yeah. - Fuck you. - Sean, Gary here. Haha, I got some good news for you. You're on avail, that means you're on hold. For that part that you put yourself on tape for a couple of months ago. I don't know, the part was I think Marcus. Anyway, that's something. Give you some hope, my man. - Excuse me, do you think these will make my butt fat? - Yo dude, can I talk to you real quick? No, I just need two seconds. - How'd you even find me, man? - Annie told me where you were. - Listen, stay away from that girl. She's a nice girl. She doesn't need you trying to fuck her in a helicopter. - Dude, I'm not trying to fuck her, all right? - What? - We can't find Freddy, all right? The execs are freaking out, the premiere's tonight, I'm worried, he's not answering my phone calls. He's not answering his agent's phone calls. We don't know what to do! I'm trying to find him. My car's right here and I need your help. I'm worried about the guy. - No. - Listen, I don't know why Freddy's all upset, dude. The studio was mad at me, not at him. If anything, I'm the one that's fucking up. - Well, you know you guys are such close pals, I don't know what to tell you. - Listen dude, I'm sorry about what happened back there. You know, I shouldn't have gotten him those Coachella tickets. That was stupid on my part. - You know what, maybe how about we don't talk, okay? - Yeah, this is just, I just felt-- - Would you just shut up? Just shut up, man! - Hey you've reached Freddy, I can't get to the phone right, - Still not picking up. - You know it's just I don't have any friends. I don't have any like real friends. Like people only hit me up because they want something either from me or my parents, you know. I just thought that Freddy and I actually really connected. I thought we were just like, you know, boys, that we got along together. - Bradley, look at me, dude. Honestly, I don't care, okay? I don't care, I don't feel bad for you. - Whoah dude, I'm a mess, man. I've been taking every drug under the sun. I've been banging just a bunch of random chicks without a condom. Oh I got this weird ass rash on my junk. You wanna see it? - No, what? What's wrong with you? - I don't know dude, I'm just, I'm pathetic. And even at the Q&A panel. Your video went viral. And it got all the viewers just a little sliver of me, this little huh. I mean I'm the star. - You might be the most narcissistic person I've ever met in my whole life. You're a sociopath. - What? Stop calling me! - I know, but it's an emergency. - Yeah, that's what you keep texting me. What's the problem? - I can't find Freddy and I was wondering if you know where he is. - You know, for a split second there I thought you were actually gonna apologize. - I'm sorry, I just, you haven't seen him by any chance, have you? - No, asshole. Why don't you try Find My Friends or something? - Okay. - How'd that go? - Not good. Not good. You didn't try Find My Friends by any chance, did you? - No, I don't have it in my contacts, no. - Really, that's so weird. I thought you guys were friends. I thought you'd be on, you know, you're like connected on everything, looks like. All right, I got him, jeez. Well. Looks like we're going to the desert. - All right, desert it is. Should we pick up some drugs? It's a joke. We'll get Red Bulls. - Don't come with me, stay in the car. Yo! Yo! - Leave me alone, man. - What are you doing? - I'm smoking myself to death. - Oh come on. You know that's not possible. If it was, we would've did it in high school. - Doesn't mean I'm not gonna try, man. - What's going on man, talk to me. - I can't fucking do this, man. - Do what? - The show, I can't do the show! - What are you talking about? - I'm not cut out for this, man. There's too much pressure. I'm no good under pressure. - You're doing it great, everybody loves you. - No, I'm not doing great! I'm doing horrible, I'm freaking out, man, look at me! Every day is planned out. Everything I do, all day long. Everyday the network execs are there and they're watching everything that I do, every day I have to be on, man. And Bradley, he's a fucking mess, man. He's always on fucking drugs or he's like late on set, he doesn't know his lines or he's coming down from the night before. Guess I just thought it was gonna be easier. It wasn't supposed to be this hard. - I mean it's weird, it's a crazy thing. I mean it's, it's change, right, change is hard. That's probably why you're super overwhelmed. This is what you worked really hard for, you know. This is what you wanted, man. I'm really sorry I haven't been around, you know. I was acting like a jealous dick and I'm really sorry. - It's not that, man, it's just, I'm sorry man. I was even a bigger dick. Like, I tried to fit into this Hollywood bullshit. It just turned me into an even bigger asshole. - Pretty sure I'm the asshole. - Maybe I should just quit. - Quit, you can't, no man. You can't quit, you're not qualified to do anything else. How are you gonna quit? - We got picked up for a third season. - That's great, what are you out here freaking out for? - They're moving us to New York. - What, the show? - Yeah I have to move to New York to be on the show. - All right, well, I mean it's not permanent. - I like it out here, man, I hate the snow. - Yeah, but you know, maybe it'll be good, it'll be different, you know? - What if I can't hack it, man? - You'll be fine, you're talented, dude. All right, and everybody, everybody gets to see it now. What am I always telling you, huh, in high school? What did I always say? - Freddy, don't fuck my sister. - No, come on, besides that. - Freddy, you're a natural. - Yeah, because you are, man. You are, this shit comes easy to you, you know. Look dude, you are gonna shoot a TV show on the streets of New York City. I mean dude, that was the dream, come on. Regardless man, I don't know about you but I've never been to a premiere before. So I'm going to this thing with or without you. - You can't get in without me. - Well that might be true but I still have an invitation. - All right, I'll go. On one condition, you gotta do me a favor. - What? - Will you turn your phone off? - Oh my god. - God, I can't have you embarrassing me. - Are you serious with this? - I can't have you embarrassing me again. - You didn't even help me. The second time wasn't even my phone. - Embarrassed me though. - Unbelievable. - Sorry. - All right, come on, let's get out of here, what are you doing here? - I don't know. - How'd you even get out here, man? - Uber. - You Ubered to the desert? What's wrong with you? It must be nice. By the way, your boy Bradley's in the fucking car. - Oh great. - Hey. - Oh hey. - Why aren't you inside? We thought we were late. - Oh no, they're running behind, I think. - Okay. Hey, Bryce, this is my friend Sean. - Hey. - What's up, Sean? I'm Bryce. How are you? - Hi. Good, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - Sean's friends with Freddy who's on the show. - Ah, Freddy. Yeah he's fine. - He is. - Um hey, could you give us a second? - Yeah, sure. - Seems nice. - It's not what you think. - No, I think it is, it's okay. - You really hurt me. - I know. - Really bad. And I don't know what it is. It's new if that makes you feel any better. - It doesn't but it's okay. - Don't do that. - It's okay, I know how this works. - That's not fair. - You're right. Look, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I was an asshole and that was uncalled for and I shouldn't have treated you like that. You don't deserve it. You deserve to be happy. I want you to be happy. And for whatever it's worth, I really liked you. And I was just too scared to tell you. - Annie, we should get going in there. - Okay. I'll see you in there? - Yeah. I'm gonna walk in. I'll probably stay in the back. - Nice meeting you man. - See you. - Later. - Sean. - David? - So, I'm sure you've heard what's going on. - Yeah. - Well, there's two sides to every story. Remember that. Your sister will come around. - Hey David? I never liked you, man. No one does. Good luck. - So I guess this is it, man. - Yeah. Excited? - I don't know what I am. I guess I'm excited. - Hey, Freddy. - Oh yeah, hey thanks. I guess that's me, man. - It's gonna be good, it's gonna be good. - I love you, man. I'll miss you. - Good luck, all right? - Yeah man, it'll be good, it'll be good, it'll be good. It'll be good, it'll be good. It'll be good. - I got you bro. - Hey, thanks, man. ¶ We could find another night to worry about self ¶ - Hey don't forget me when you're out there. - Never. - Yeah you say that now. - Come on, seriously? - Just go, go, go go. ¶ I mean it's just a little tight ¶ ¶ The way that you hold me ¶ ¶ You belong to somebody ¶ - Look at his dirty hat.
