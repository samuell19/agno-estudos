Social Hygiene Antonin. Your silence is heavy. Stop dilly-dallying. Solveig, my dear sister, I am telling you: humanity is losing all reason. Oh no. No, don’t give me that. Change the subject at once. I’m sore everywhere. Each one of my muscles. Fatigue from morning till night. Even lowering my ass onto my discount mattress is painful. Always the same refrain. You’ll get no pity from me today. Even you refuse to understand. It’s within my rights to feel deep moral fatigue before the ugliness of the world. This dandy character that you have invented for yourself to get attention is both tiresome and lacking in originality. You are handsome, young, strong and brilliant. But even aunt Jeanne’s cancer-ridden tomcat is more lively than you. You insult me, Solveig. It’s the truth. Alright, tell me. I am worn out, my dear sister. I don’t eat enough. I have a few friends but I have no work. I went down to the port to beg for a job. No ship, ocean liner or fishing boat will take me. I’ll give you some money Antonin, relax. Give me an address. The discount mattress I mentioned to you doesn’t even exist! I’m sleeping in a friend’s car. Michel’s Volkswagen. It’s small but warm. I can’t believe it, sleeping in a car! Indeed, Solveig. Such is my fate. How do you fill your days? Oh! I quit smoking. Great. What else? With Michel, I have improved my strategies and approaches. Which ones? We have worked out a fail-proof system. Nothing extravagant and completely free of violence. I detest violence. Antonin, what are you talking about? We steal things. Robbing travellers, passers-by, tourists. That is my day job. It’s risk-free. It’s all gentleness, genius and rigour. This, my sister, is what allows me to nibble a bit of sausage, go to the cinema on Fridays and buy drinks for girls. And it’s how I’m able to afford this beautiful gilded scarf. You asked me the question, Solveig, and so I’m answering. My brother, a thief, a thug. Shame. I am not a thug. Michel is a gentleman. He wouldn’t harm a fly. He is a brilliant trickster. Often, we spend all day at the train station. Everything is there. The average traveller is so easy to distract. He buys a newspaper, I knock over his umbrella. He bends over to pick it up, his raincoat opens a bit. Michel grabs his wallet while I shower him with apologies. On Saturdays we go to the airport. The incoming flight from Tokyo is a gold mine for us. All those cameras and video equipment! I don’t need to draw you a picture. Tokyo! I am so ashamed. Yesterday, a nice old fellow on the platform told me all about his trip to Barcelona. What do I care about Barcelona, I ask you? La Sagrada Familia! Michel had lots of time to pick through his briefcase. Underneath papers and porno rags was a beautiful Swiss watch. A Breguet, with silicium hands. A marvel. See Solveig... Your ears are shocked and your morals are shaken, but why? I wake up in a car, I do a bit of stretching, I take a shower at the municipal pool, I groom myself, and then I go off stealing. In the evenings I chat with Michel. We play cards. There is nothing more to know. But my body is so sore and I am so anxious. With good reason. If only Mother knew how you spent your days. Leave the dead in peace, Solveig. Good people irritate me terribly. Thieves may be despicable, but they believe in a job well done. You are as vicious as a snake. You’ll end up in jail. Oh no! And I’ll end up bringing you fruit baskets at Christmas. Or maybe I won’t even go! I’ll pretend to miss the bus. You have a sense of humour! I thought that was a lost cause. Do you want some news from Papa? Certainly not. And Églantine, what does she have to say about the mess your life has become? Églantine doesn’t care. I think she has a boyfriend. Her story about taking a painting class on Wednesday nights strikes me as very fishy. Your wife is cheating on you? Her good mood makes me suspicious. And how do you feel about it? Meh. You really don’t care about anything, my brother. You’re on a roll today. It brings me joy. Do you know a good doctor? Go see Franklin. He’ll examine you with great feeling. Franklin examines you with feeling? Don’t be vulgar. But yes, he is a master. And Michel is doing well? You ask about me as a way of getting at Michel. You're as agile as a kitten. I’m single! Michel has a hygiene problem. I’m the one who sleeps in his car and he’s the one who rejects every bar of soap. He stinks. I have to talk to him about it, or we will soon be detected. Will you say hello to him for me? You live dangerously! Fine. Antonin. I imagine that you want money? I wouldn’t dare. Now you know that I'm a scam artist. Why don’t you give me the number of the doctor who examines so well? Maybe he’ll find a cancer or two. No one needs your black humour. I don’t like cynical people. Cynicism doesn’t run in our family. And let’s speak no more about your loathsome activities. Be a burglar if you want, but don’t speak to me about it again, alright? Fine. Beautiful day, isn’t it? You don’t even care about your sister. Did you find yourself a man at the office? I don’t look for romance at work, Antonin. Why go to work then? To work. To feel useful. To fulfil myself. Last week, I was wandering around the train station. A little boy asked me if he could polish my shoes in exchange for a few bucks. I never imagined myself getting my shoes polished by a kid. I said yes and I watched him work. His efforts were so precise, his little hands danced over the leather. I started to cry. The tears flowed out of me and wouldn’t stop. I gave him a big tip. I asked his name. Samir, he was called. I said to him, "Samir, "you work hard, you feel useful, you fulfil yourself." And he smiled at me. You are crude, Antonin. I’m wasting my time with you. You want Franklin’s number? 19 19 18 901. 19 19 18 901. Thanks, I have a good memory. And you, Solveig. How are you? I had a cup of tea this morning in a spot you would have loved, my dear wife. There were four immense chandeliers. I asked the waiter to tell me about them. Italian crystal Mortons, worth $3000 each. Chandeliers interest you now? Why not? There was beautiful blue carpet with a fleur-de-lys motif. A gigantic Klimt reproduction on the wall. I think it was Klimt. Behind the bar was a fat woman with too much makeup who didn’t smile much. Above her head, a dozen typewriters on a shelf. And the cake display, my dear Églantine, if only you could have seen it... Antonin? What? Do we have so little to say to each other? You didn't marry me for my love of chandeliers and sweets. All right. Two weeks without a word from you, Antonin. We don’t see each other anymore. Time is a rabid dog. You must speak to me seriously. We live freely, of course, but we need some structure, Antonin. Have I become your part-time wife? I’ve heard rumours of you sleeping in a Volkswagen. Yes, that rumour is stubborn. You don’t wish to see me anymore? Our conjugal bed is too small? Are you seeing someone? Tell me, don't you like me anymore? The Department of Rumours suggests that you have a boyfriend. What’s the name of your Wednesday night painting class? You’re changing the subject. I still love you, the same way I love a good cup of hot milk. His name is Clovis. I have Clovis and you've told me about Cassiopée. We’re both busted. I have not consummated with Cassiopée. She resists me. And with Clovis-Syphilis, is it serious? Yes. He is handsome, ambitious, courteous, brilliant. He’s an architect. Scoundrel! And here I was thinking about you in the café this morning. Liar. You’re not jealous. I love you, my husband. Clovis entertains me and makes love to me, that’s all. I prefer you and your stories. And the fact that you’re living in a car strikes me as romantic. You are bigger than him. You smell nice. You speak German and you're a good cook. I could be a happy woman. I’ll offer you flowers and a precious stone. We’ll make peace. Asshole. What you just said there is very nice. I’m touched. But you admit you are cheating on me. I have to process this. I’ll speak to Michel about it and stay a while longer in his car. The nights will bring wisdom. I know you still love me, Antonin. I tell you, our civilization will leave no trace of it. Will you introduce me to Clovis-Syphilis? I know you. You’ll get bored. Within five minutes you’ll feel like you’ve wasted two days. But if you want, yes. I’ve changed my mind. Keep your Clovis in your own sheets, my dear wife. Did he make love to you in our bed? No. When you’re gone, I will weep. I see. Are you still robbing honest people? Yes. It relaxes me. We were thinking about robbing a bank in a few weeks. A new challenge. You’re trying to shock me. We won’t hurt anyone. We’ll use fake guns. We’ll shout. We’ll frighten the employees. But he who risks nothing has nothing. With this money I’ll buy you some furs for the winter. I may be spendthrift but after this exploit, I’ll have enough to buy you everything you deserve. Empty promises! Believe what you wish, Églantine. You find criminals terribly sexy. When I was poor, women would warm to me. Then I changed. I stole jewelry. No one warms to a rich man. But he can buy his respect. A woman’s respect must be earned. You understand nothing. I am lazy, and much less handsome now, so yes, I am willing to purchase it. Being poor is no longer fashionable. Your relationship with money is unhealthy, darling. I’ve started to like feeling the weight of money in my trouser pocket. You knew me when I was a filthy little wastrel. Today I’m trying to be a somebody. By robbing a bank? Yes. Like a hero. I find you tedious, Antonin. Every day I’m thankful for the random good luck of not having your children. It’s not too late to have kids, Églantine. I’d rather self-immolate at Place St-Anne. Charming! I didn’t like being a kid when I was one. I was always conscious of the fact that playing with dolls made me childish. Same thing for children’s books, children’s games. Doing little boy things while yearning to become an adult. It was terrible and stupid. But stupid and useless things are often the most beautiful. Now I hate doing adult things. You are immature and proud of it. You are desirable, you have a sharp mind and many other qualities but you understand nothing of men. That's just the way it is. Would you like to go to the sea with me today? To do what? Antonin, the question is simple and I forbid you to complicate it. Do you want to accompany your wife to the sea, now, without debating it? My head hurts. And my back. Do you want to come to the sea? We’ll have a nap. You’ll lie on your stomach and I’ll rub my breasts on your back. I’ll breathe heavily on your neck and your erection will leave a mark in the sand. You’re staring at me, Antonin. I am uncomfortable. Pardon me, Cassiopée. My heart leaps in your presence. Control yourself. Nothing good came from your spectacle last time. I am still shaken. Two sensible people should normally be able to speak to each other, don’t you think? Be reasonable. Are you alright, my friend? Now I am. You are so beautiful. In a hoarse voice, I would say things into your ear. I would use acceptable language. I promise. Such talk is for nights of drinking, Antonin. Mornings are for the rational mind. You’re not making the task easy for me. I find small-talk with you nearly impossible. With my wife I can do it, with my prudish sister as well. With the postman, the milkman, the boy who works in the café, but with you, it feels vulgar. What are you doing Tuesday night? To once again go strolling along the river bank? The answer is no. Why is that? Just because. I don’t want to get back together with you for the moment. I have intimate matters to settle with someone else. Perhaps another time, alright? I did notice you advertising your involvement with someone else. It breaks my heart, but what can I do? What are you talking about? I advertise nothing. Your Facebook would beg to differ, my darling. Can it be possible that I am the one who is responsible, entirely responsible, for everything that happens? Everything! Yes, everything. As if things or events start to... As if the second I open my mouth or set foot somewhere, everything falls apart, everything crumbles. I would love to know the true nature of your pain, Antonin. But I see only your complaisance and cynicism. But perhaps you are also very sick to speak in such a way. I am being punished for something, Cassiopée. It is frankly improbable that a man, wretched as he may be, would be unable to convince a girl like you to give herself to him, even if it’s just for a night. Well, that’s how it is. And who could this man be, with whom you purport to have “matters to settle”? That’s my business. I studied advanced mathematics. I’m good-looking, I sometimes have a bit of money, I have good taste, a good mind. I’m the catch of the century. And yet, you women... What about us women? Oh, I don’t know anymore. I’d sleep for 100 years, Cassiopée. Be patient! Is it him? No. So he is spying on our conversation? He’s a friend. I’d like to see you one-on-one, but you are so unpredictable. I fear your reactions, Antonin. When love calls, love is unpredictable. I feel badly to have scared you, Cassiopée. Your friend is looking at the sky quite a lot. Dying people tend to look at the sky, have you noticed? Rubbish. You are cold today. You women are only pretty, likeable and cheerful around those you think are successful. More rubbish. You run away from poverty, laziness and insufficiency. I understand you. And that’s the image I give off. Right now I am lacking in money, love, consideration and entertainment. It ruins my mood! You don’t go out anymore? I went to the opening of the new hippodrome. And the following night, I dreamt about a woman with the head of a horse. An evil woman with a voice so terrible it could shatter your eardrums. I’m now frightened of public spaces. I fear she may lurk behind every turn. I have only walked in a straight line ever since. I feel like everyone is staring at me. You see how you speak, Antonin? I would like to meet with you one-on-one for a coffee. I imagine myself in front of a glass display with you, laughing as we choose a tartelette. But hearing you... It’s how I am made. Annoying, awkward, flea-bitten and rude. I’ve invented neither the wheel nor powder. You forgot leprous. I love you more than you think. You have to get a hold of yourself. You are proud and full of ideas. Are you still writing? Still planning to direct a film? Neither today, nor tomorrow. Shit Antonin! You’re not a slug! Be a man! With my work in the flower shop, I have a lot of time to daydream. As I await horticulturalists and romantics, I sometimes fall asleep. I imagine a film script, a novel, a simple fairy story for children. Then reality catches up to me and my ideas vanish. But it’s different for you, isn’t it, Antonin? You get your ideas on paper so easily. You’re not wrong. What are you working on? I wouldn’t dare talk about it. Please. It’s a bit anecdotal, for the moment. You intrigue me. I insist. What is it? It’s the story of an unemployed man who tries to open a bag of coffee and drops his pair of scissors behind the stove. Ok. He tries to move the stove, but it’s impossible. He reaches between the wall and the stove but his arm is too big. He decides to go people-watching on the steps of the church at Place du Marché. Children play and run through the alleys and into the skirts of their mothers. The man notices that one of the kids has very small arms. They could easily reach behind his stove and snatch his pair of scissors. Okay. The man must quickly develop a friendship with this kid in order for his plan to work. To get the scissors from behind the stove? Exactly! I see. I like fraternity, but I want to explore human solitude; the troubles of daily life, you know? I know that with a little ambition, all is not darkness. I am in love with you, Cassiopée. Nothing else has any importance. Let’s make a pact, Antonin. I will see you again. Between now and then, you will pull yourself together and get your life back on track. Alright? Women lead the world. How is Églantine? Don’t speak about my wife. You will write your script. You will take a break from the misery in which you are wallowing. Between now and then, I will resolve my own problems. Next time, I will come alone and be cheerful. You speak like a banker addressing a kid setting up a savings account. My heart has plenty of time to darken between now and then. Love needs time. I feel desire for you. I know I’m making you wait. But such is life. Your coldness overwhelms me. Plenty of men might slap that angel face of yours. Men are boorish. But not you. Fine. I’m going to the cinema. I’ll sit in the first row. That way I’ll see the movie before anyone else. You’re funny. Alright my friend. But I must tell you that I do not like this spy, about whom I have no information. I challenge him to a duel. Let’s go! It’s so sexy. Sir? If you wish. My name is Rose. I work for the Ministry of Revenue. Impossible. What do you mean? It's a pseudonym! To be named “Rose” and work in such a Ministry! With trustworthy people, with reasonable people, we communicate by the post, by e-mail or by telephone. O You the All Merciful! Your file has been worrisome to even the toughest amongst our ranks. Ah, those guys. What do you have to say about your many years of unpaid taxes? I would say that misery follows me. I have neither an address, nor any friends. I sleep in doorways. I barely manage to eat a mouthful of bread each night. My information suggests otherwise. You live the life of a troublemaker. Do not try to butter me up. Nothing could be more false. I am poor and am preparing for yet more poverty. There is only a fine line separating my life from that of a stray dog. Where do you get your information? I’m not with the police. But they will find you soon enough. We must come to an arrangement, my dear sir. You live at 39 rue de la Commune? Rose, my dear Rose, I am terrified of prison. In prison, men have more tattoos than teeth. It reeks of blood and sperm. Surely, it’s not a place for me. Look at me. How much do I owe the State? Stop obfuscating. The hour is late and the problem is serious. Why do you resist your civic duty? It’s people like you who mock law and order. I live for order and morality, my dear Rose. You would be unable to repeat this sentence without laughing. If I may, how did you discover your passion for rectitude and righteousness? From my father. He was a miner. And a tyrant. He beat my sister and I, every Friday night after dinner. Then he apologized, explained to us the importance and the benefits of beating one’s children and then read us a Brothers Grimm fairy tale. I loved him deeply and his death broke me into a thousand pieces. My mother died before him. A horrific cancer. He fell into a terrible depression and started beating us again, harder and more often. Before, he used objects. After my mother’s death, he only used his hands. This story you have just told me, is it the truest truth? No, it’s a ruse. My father is still alive and gentle as a lamb. He is my boss at the Ministry. A sad story can usually soften up a crook like you. Often, they pay their taxes on the spot. Clever. I will disappoint you but I’m not against the system. I think there's a certain elegance in paying one’s taxes. My problem is very simple: I have no money. I never have money. You’re not homeless. You live on Rue de la Commune. Alas, yes. With an old mistress who demands no rent. You have commercial activities. We know you do. I’m in Import-Export. Diabolical! All villains work in Import-Export. I detest this answer. It’s an answer I get from all the Arabs, Indians and Chinese. And you are racist! Necessarily. “I am racist necessarily.” What an abomination! You are withering, my dear old rose. Watch your mouth. I can withstand ugliness, but racism is a cancer. It hurts my heart. That will change nothing about your circumstances, my dear sir. Either you pay or you go to prison. I would like to beat you with objects or with my hands. I have the key to your prison cell at the end of my pen. We must come to an arrangement. Fucking hell. I am a spendthrift and today I am paying for it. I need a wife to manage my transient fortunes. A countess or a princess. Or at least a baroness. You will find no princess in jail. And you’re wasting my time. I must admit your outfit is very pretty. And do I catch a whiff of your perfume? It’s the blood and sperm closing in on you, buddy. I have lived rather poorly. But I will die well. And certainly not in prison. Alright. Tomorrow, at this same time, I will have a considerable sum for you. Come with the gendarmes if you don’t believe me. If I’m lying, I will walk straight into your dungeon. When I think about it, I actually like paying taxes. Finally some common sense. I imagined a city that was morbid but fascinating. Of course, we obediently paid our taxes but, more importantly, we figured out how to resolve a serious problem. You see, there were more than 11,000 stray dogs in the city and a bureaucrat emerged with an ingenious solution. The civic leaders started to pay a salary to children. Over the course of one month, kids took to the streets and spiked dog snacks with strychnine. The animals dropped dead and the children learned about discipline and the pride of a job well done. After that, the canine population was easier to manage. We sterilized stray dogs, clipping a microchip in their ears to keep track. Imagine the results! I apply the law. I am not a fascist. Tomorrow, same time? This joust is disastrous. You are a foot-soldier of the state, a racist shrew. Pencil pusher! Are you finished? Tomorrow! Same time. But somewhere else. You’ll know how to find me. You are an irresponsible idiot. I’m not afraid to show off my uniqueness. I accept myself for who I am. I live a life of adventures. You're jealous. You need to have children, Antonin. They will help you organize your life. I’ll have children as soon as I’m certain they’ll respect me. When I’m 50, 60 or 70 years old. Otherwise it’s not worth it. Imagine thinking your father is a failure. Our cousin Janelle had twins, did you know? A boy and a girl. Good for Janelle. She is such an eccentric. Did she call them Clitorine and Masturbin? Our meetings weigh on my spirit, sister. You can't keep telling me how to live my life. Tell me about yourself instead and try not to be too boring about it. I met a man. I’ll be damned. Very handsome and strong, but a weirdo. I’ll be damned. I was sitting alone in a restaurant. He came over. I have never seen such eyes. A mix of green and the very deepest blue. Greying at the temples, in his early 50s, very elegant. He says, “Can I tell you about the All Merciful?” An Allah freak, an enlightened one, a multiplicator of bread! You really will speak to just anybody. Hold on! It’s impossible to refuse having a mint tea with this kind of person. A tourist. An Icelander, can you imagine? No. In 1988, he was a competitive weightlifter in the Seoul Olympics. He didn’t rank. Then he returned to Iceland. He got married, found work as a mechanic. A man without too much of a story, you see? Yes I see. Icelandic Christian weightlifter, that's already pretty good. Are you aware of the phenomenon known as spontaneous human combustion? Solveig, I suddenly have a great urge to go do something else. Listen to me. My Icelander told me of the very first recorded case of spontaneous combustion in the 15th century. In Milan, a Polish knight is said to have drunk a litre or two of strong wine and then began vomiting fire. Within seconds, his entire body was consumed in flames. Over a cup of tea, he described to me a dozen such cases of spontaneous combustion, one by one. His eyes flashing, he never let me get a word in edgewise. Only God can provoke such phenomena, he says. And? He is terrified. He feels a dormant fire within him and thinks he’s next in line. I hope you slept with him. Without hesitation! You only live once. Carpe Diem! What do you do in life, Aurore? I study theology and I work at McDonald’s on weekends. You’re interested in religions? Yes. Are you religious? In my own way. How’s that? Something hovers over me. I know it. But it has nothing to do with God. It’s more like a force I can trust in, in which I can take comfort. It sounds quite a lot like what might be called ‘believing in God.’ It’s different in my opinion. What is your dream job? I can feel the mockery in your question. And you, what does a person like you believe in? A person like me? You don’t even know me. A person like you who likes to make fun of the fate of others. I believe in myself. I believe I can find the key to the enigmas of life by myself. No one has ever given me proof that God exists and so I believe in me. You have a high opinion of yourself. If Death should arrive to take you away, will you challenge her to a game of chess for your fate? The Seventh Seal. Ingmar Bergman, 1957. You are not only pretty, you are also a cinephile. And here you are, standing in my path. Are you Death? Or the Love I am no longer seeking? I will disappoint you. I am one of your victims. My victim? I’m afraid so. Three nights ago, you smashed the window of my Mini Cooper and made off with my laptop computer and my boyfriend’s leather jacket. It looks nice on you, by the way. I’m busted. You would even break into a car with a Baby on Board sticker! Such nerve! There was neither baby nor child in the vehicle. I don’t have any kids. Those stickers typically repel bad guys. You have no scruples. I can give you back your things but I refuse to feel shame. I never see the face of my victims. Today I have seen yours, but I remain without remorse. I was right to follow you for the past three days. You are interesting. Pity you are a small-time crook. Let’s lighten the mood. I will return your computer and this lovely garment. I simply ask you not to go to the police, ok? What about my car window? Shit! I have no money. Can we come to an arrangement? Why are people so mean? That question seems rather extreme for a leather jacket and a broken windshield. Do you know where men come from? Tell me. In Ancient Greece, Zeus decided one day to get rid of men. He was fed up with their malice. For nine days and nine nights, torrents of rain destroyed everything in their path. Only Deucalion and Pyrrha survived the wrath of Zeus. By throwing rocks behind them, Deucalion and Pyrrha repopulated the earth. It is said that these new men were more courageous from then on, but also more boorish. What a nice story. Well noted. Yes. It’s a story that confirms that a man can smash a windshield and run off with a laptop without the slightest regret. I could fall in love with you, mademoiselle. Let’s come to an arrangement. You are a rogue. I have difficulty believing that your days are brightened by robbing honest people. I like to kill time, yes. I also assassinate all my nights. Impossible to kill time without insulting eternity, isn’t it? Do you have a lot of these catch phrases? How do you fill the cosmic emptiness of your life, Antonin? You're trying to know me! I like music, I like dance and I have an interest in criminals. I am a filmmaker. I’m looking for myself. It’s difficult. Interesting. What have you directed? Nothing at all. I have a very romantic and idealized vision of cinema. Cinema creates a bridge between what is real and what the world could be. Nice. I can’t find the bridge. It’s as simple as that. Is imagining a film the same as making one? I'd like to believe that's the case. The real occupies you too much, dear Antonin. Reassure me that you are at least writing something. Yes, yes. I’m writing the story of an unemployed man who tries to open a bag of coffee and drops his pair of scissors behind his stove. Ah? Yes. That’s it? I’ve had a lot of troubles. Firstly with fiduciary matters but also with my wife, with law and with taxes. I am fleeing my creditors. The stars have aligned to slow down my artistic efforts. In the end dear Antonin, you are merely a wretched pickpocket? Aurore, be blessed by the smile you put on my lips. Here. Take your boyfriend’s jacket. What’s his name, by the way? Johnny. Of course. You love him? More than anything. Does he want to bust my face? Yes, he does. From now on, I am in your debt. I have so many debts, it’s almost like having friends. Casanova! Églantine. Bird of Misfortune. What are you doing here? Darling, what sin am I committing? Cassiopée will be here any minute now. I would like my life to follow its course, without upsets, without painful episodes like this one. I won’t shed a tear. You’re not worth it. And if I caught you in the arms of Clovis-Syphilis? I don’t see him anymore. Really? I’ll tell you nothing more. Men are like mushrooms. The more handsome they are, the more poison they contain. I discovered that someone else has the same name as me. I’m told that he even looks like me. I think I see myself everywhere. I see hallucinations of myself in crowds. Even on the cloudiest surfaces I manage to see my reflection. I now have to deal with two of me. That is no mystery. You're narcissistic. Do you still love me? I’m waiting for your competitor. You’ve caught me in the act. How can I answer that question? The ridicule would kill me. You are 100 times dead. I love you as a zombie. Goodbye. Adieu. Hello Antonin. Cassiopée! You were speaking to your wife. Confronting and contradicting one’s wife is such an extreme sport. You are sad. No! You are here. Where did you meet Églantine? Tell me the story. At the zoo. By the hyena cage. The rest is a long, quiet river. It's been proven that married men live longer. Who said that I wish to grow old? Did the unemployed man get his scissors out from behind the stove? I love your mind. I’ve been thinking a lot. I’m in love with another man by the name of Miroslav Petorski. His gentleness is infinite. There. Now you know everything. I will now take my leave from you, Antonin. But what would be the thoughts of a calf who looks at fireworks?
