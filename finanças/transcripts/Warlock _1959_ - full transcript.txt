Whoa! Hyah! Come on! Come on! Come on! Get off the street! They're comin'! Come on! Get off the street! They're comin'! Get off the street! I see them, Miss Jessie. They're here. - Abe. - Take care of the horses. Where are the men to stop them? Where are the men to help Thomson? I'd like to see them all burn in hell. Thomson! Thomson, come out of there! Roy, you want me to go with ya? No, thanks. This town may not need a deputy, - but it sure-as-shootin' needs a fireman. - Thomson! I'm here to talk about my man Harms! He's dead! Murdered! You've murdered too many good men, Thomson! Come on out into the street! Or are you a coward? A back-shootin' coward who won't face me! - Going for a little ride, Sheriff? - Luke! Sheriff, quit it! - Back off the horse! - Don't get rough on him now, fellas. Let's give him a hand. Let's give him a hand now. That's a boy. That's a good... That-a-boy, Sheriff. - Oh! - Oh, Sheriff! - Brush him off. Yeah. - You're all dirty. You've gotta practice your mountin', Sheriff. - Okay, let's get him on. - Hey, Luke, here's a present for you. - Come on! - Get him up there! Let's give him a guard of honor, boys. Yes, sir! There you go. ♪ We will hang Sheriff Thomson ♪ ♪ From a sour apple tree ♪ ♪ We will hang Sheriff Thomson From a sour apple tree ♪ ♪ As we go marching on ♪ ♪ We will hang Sheriff Thomson From a sour apple tree ♪ ♪ We will hang Sheriff Thomson From a sour apple tree ♪ ♪ We will hang Sheriff Thomson From a sour apple tree ♪ ♪ Good-bye, Sheriff Thomson Good-bye ♪ I'm old. I'm much too old. Warlock ain't for me. Gotta get out of this town. - Gotta get out. - Too late. Too late for us all. Yahoo! All right, men! Let's go! Come on, Curley! Giddap! - Hey, I can't find Johnny! - It's only 4:00. - Where's my horse? - Johnny. Johnny. Wake up, Johnny. Come on. No, I wanna sleep. You're a fine example of a big brother. When I sleep I feel good, and I wanna feel good. Yeah, sure. Come on. That-a-way, Billy. Help me. Help me to feel good. I can't figure you anymore, Johnny. I swear I can't figure you. Hey, Pony Benner! Come on! Let's go, Pony! He's gettin' himself all prettied up. - Hurry up, you. I gotta get out of here. - I'm a-try. If you just give me time. Ain't gonna do no good, Pony! You're the ugliest! Come on! Look what he did! Look what he did! Come on, Pony. Let's go. Johnny! Come on. We gotta go. Come on! - Whoo-hoo! - Hyah! Hyah! Thomson didn't stand a prayer, did he? - Did he, Abe? - Johnny, you're drunk. When were Cade and Benner supposed to back-shoot him, before or after he drew? Cade and Benner had orders to shoot only if there was interference from outside. Interference from who? There's no man in Warlock that'd dare come against you in a fight. No? Well, there's getting to be a lot more of 'em, new ones all the time, and I gotta keep letting 'em know I was here first. How long does that give you the right to run things your way, Abe? - As long as I want. - Yeah. Well, all I'm sayin' is that when you stand to win, you gotta be able to stand to lose too. I say the time has come to take up arms in our defense. Last night was the fourth time in a month this town has come to a standstill, driven to cover by them murdering cowboys. - We put our faith in Thomson. He ran. - While everyone else hid. An excellent point, Miss Jessie. - But it's time to stop hiding. - We've got 'em outnumbered five to one. We've got arms. We've got to fight them off with arms. At the risk of losing our own lives? I have a quart of ore that I have to deliver for my silver mines. Yet my miners are terrorized, my ore wagons wrecked. We can't let this anarchism, murder and violence destroy Warlock, even at the risk of our lives! I say we arm ourselves and serve notice we'll stand and fight. That's the only way to handle it, and the rest of you men know it! Wrong, wrong, wrong. It's all wrong! You're using anarchy and murder to try to prevent anarchy and murder. You're doin' the same thing as McQuown. - What's the alternative, Judge? - Law and order. - That's the alternative. - There is one other way. We can hire our own marshal. Lots of towns have done it. We can't hire a marshal. There's no such position in this town because we're not legally a town. He'd be just as much a marshal as you are a judge, Mr. Holloway, on acceptance, as you put it. He'd act for us... the Citizens' Committee of Warlock. The only way to handle this is the legal way. We'll send to Bright's City for Sheriff Keller. What'll he do, send us another Thomson? Keller's 50 miles away. Might as well be a thousand for all the times he ever comes down here. I say we try our own marshal. Well, this looks like a happy gathering. Something going on we should know about? Just foolish committee talk, Curley. Something I can do for you? Well, with all this foolish committee talk going on, half the stores in town are closed. And it is supply day at San Pablo, Mr. Richardson. Now, let's see. I'd like to have a half dozen sacks of flour... J-Just give me a few minutes, Curley, and I'll be open for business. Yes, sir, Mr. Richardson. We wouldn't think of breaking up such an important meeting. I tell you what. We'll just wait outside... Pony and Johnny and me. Benner killed our barber. Just an hour ago, we were all very indignant about that, yet there he stood! None of us did anything about it. All right, Henry. You've made your point. But who are you gonna get for your marshal? I have such a man in mind... Clay Blaisedell, serving at present as marshal in Fort James. You mean vigilante, gambler and gunman. I'm sure we've all heard about him. Even been a book written about him by Caleb Bane. Mr. Bane attributes all manner of courage and prowess to Mr. Blaisedell. He even presented him with a pair of gold-handled Colts for his brave deeds. I saw Blaisedell once in Fort James, the day after he killed Big Ben Nicholson. He was a bad one, Nicholson was. Blaisedell deserved those gold Colts. He's the best. Well, is this, um, superhuman going to subdue the savage breast by the pure power of his eye or by the menace of his six-shooter or simply by his reputation? None of those, Miss Jessie. Blaisedell's only hope in Warlock is to be lead-proof. There she is, Clay. Warlock. Looks like a fair-enough town. Better than some I've seen. It's just for a short stay, anyway. Well, we'll find out. They're coming! They're coming! I saw 'em! They're coming! I saw 'em! They're coming! Well, Jessie, there he comes, gold-handled Colts and all. I think this is a real beginning for Warlock. Well, he's here. And I'm going. I've sold out to Morgan. Yes, I guess you have. I wonder if we all have. - Morning, Mr. Blaisedell. - Blaisedell. - I'm Judge Holloway. - I didn't know Warlock had a judge. On acceptance. On acceptance only, same way you're a marshal. Just wanted to get a good look at you. - They say you're a decent man. - I thank them. But it's not enough to be decent when you have yourself set where you have to kill men and judge which men to kill, for where is the law? Well, I guess I'll be the law, Judge, on your acceptance. No, not on mine. I don't accept you. Any man... Any man who's got himself set over others and hasn't any responsibility to something bigger than himself is a murdering swine! - Shut up, Judge! - There's something bigger than all men, and that's the law! - Do you hear me? The law! - Come on! - That's a nice welcoming committee. - Better than some I've seen. As I understand it, then, I have full authority, accountable only to you, the Citizens' Committee. Yes, that's it. Accountable to us. - That's what I said, Mr. Petrix. - Oh. I'm sorry. I'll carry out my duties in ways best fitted to the job, the aim being always, of course, the public safety. Peace and safety. That's our aim. Yes, sir. You won't be surprised then if I have to post men out of town. A last resort, of course, in the case of real troublemakers. They've been informed that they're coming into town at the risk of their lives. I suggest you start by posting every one of the San Pablo cowboys, Marshal. Just a minute, Buck. All those boys ain't so bad. I happen to like Curley Burne and Billy Gannon, among others. It's McQuown and Benner and Cade. Mr. Skinner, Mr. Slavin, you will let that be my choice. There are one or two miners, real troublemakers. - If I could give you their names... - He's not your private marshal. Also my choice, Mr. McDonald, Miss... There's only one other thing, Marshal. Some of the townsfolk have been wondering about Mr. Morgan, whether he'll have any official status. May I see that? Tom Morgan's my friend, and we've been friends for over ten years. I've never known him to commit an evil act. You'll have to take my word for that. I started working for him as a faro dealer. I still stand behind the wheel on occasion. Faro dealer? Oh, yes. We're partners, you see. The $400 a month I get from you would hardly pay for the ammunition I use up in practice. Fortunately, as a faro dealer, I'm an attraction. Things work out very well. I presume by "an attraction," you mean that people come hoping to see you shoot someone dead? - You don't approve of me, do you, Miss... - Marlow. Jessie Marlow. It really doesn't matter. I'm in the minority. Well, you won't be in the minority very long, Miss Marlow. People generally begin to resent me. I don't mind it when it happens. It's part of the job. - Marshal, let me assure you... - But it will happen. I come here as your salvation at a very high wage. I establish order and ride roughshod over offenders. At first you're pleased because there's a good deal less trouble. Then a very strange thing happens. You begin to feel I'm too powerful. You begin to fear me. Not me, but what I am. When that happens, we shall have had full satisfaction from one another. It'll be time for me to leave. You speak as though from great experience. Has this happened in many towns? Yes, ma'am, in a lot of towns. Clay, aren't you finished yet? Come on up. - Excuse me. - Mm-hmm. Well, we might as well adjourn. Maybe they can't hold guns, but they sure can hold meetings. What's that? "The Black Rattlesnake of Fort James." That's a very poetic image. Come on. I'll show you your quarters. Oh, Murch. Start cleaning up downstairs, will you? All right. Well? Aw, look, this'll fix up fine. First thing we do is we get rid of all this trash. Look. We each have a bedroom and a parlor. - I'll fix this up real, real fancy. - Well, don't work too hard. There's only one bunch against us here... the McQuowns. Shouldn't take too long. These aren't just tourists like those Tejanos up in Fort James. I hear this is a bad bunch. Well, any case, let's drink to the next town. Let's drink to this town first and a successful meeting with the McQuowns. Yeah. The sooner the better, huh? - How. - How. Cade. Benner. Chet. Go back to work. Deal you in? - Evening. - It is, isn't it? Some of McQuown's boys just, uh, come in. Is that so? Did McQuown come in himself? Not yet. I been doing a little investigatin'. I have 'em all pegged. Come here. See that, uh... that big fella? That's Jack Cade. He's number two to McQuown. Next to him is Chet Haggin. The little sneaky one on the right, that's Pony Benner. Jack Cade, he's, uh... he's supposed to be the meanest. - I see you added something. - Hey, I wondered when you'd notice. She came in the last batch from San Francisco, along with those drapes. Kind of held out till today 'cause I didn't know if you were big enough to handle her on your wall. Very pretty. I wonder if McQuown's coming in. Don't worry about McQuown. You'll never see him come up against you. His style is to play it with a back-shooter. - You just watch out for Cade. - You said that before. You want me to handle some of the... some of the action? I'll play it my way, Morg, and see if they don't have to too. Say, I hope you put on your gold-handled pair. There'd be a lot disappointed here tonight if they don't see 'em flash. They're for Sunday-go-to-meetin', Morg. This is a workday. All right. See you downstairs. - I'm ready. - All right. Let's have a drink in the French Palace. Maybe that marshal will join us. - Let's go get him. - Now, take it easy, Billy. Let's go, Johnny. Murch, they're comin'. You watch for back-shooters. Anybody moves, you let go. With this? It'll mash half the place. Anybody makes a move at Clay's back, you let go. I don't care who you mash. All right. But what'll Blaisedell say? Nothing if he's dead. Evening, Mr. McQuown, gentlemen. The place is yours. - A nice place it is. - Thank you. A drink for Mr. McQuown and his friends. I hope you enjoy yourselves. We will. Blaisedell will be halfway back to Fort James by now. - Don't you wish it, Pony. - Oh, he'll be here, all right. This one's a different breed of horse. This is gonna be a good one, a real good one. Hey, Billy! Maybe you and me and Curley and Chet can have a game of cards over here. Whiskey. Oh, Mr. Marshal? Marshal, I wonder, could I make a little complaint? Now, I... I guess it's up to me. There's just been a heap of fussin' about it, but seems like folks just kind of gone and left it up to me. It's them gold handles of yours, Marshal. I sure do hope you ain't wearin' 'em tonight, because they are awfully hard on a man's eyes. Now, I'm just speaking for myself, now, Marshal, but I'd surely hate to get a case of eyestrain from them gold handles. You know, they's so bright in the sun and all. A man just... He ain't much use without his good eyes. And I hear there have been an awful lot of them strained in Warlock lately. You could close your eyes. "Close my..." Oh, Marshal, I'd just look foolish. I'd just be bumping and wumping all over the place trying to get around with my eyes closed. Marshal, por favor, couldn't you just not polish them handles so bright, hand-rubbin' on 'em like they say you do? I guess I might do that, if things fell right in town here. Marshal... what if somebody painted them handles black for you? That might do. But who's to do it? Whoo-ee! McQuown. McQuown! McQuown, my name's Blaisedell. I'm hired to keep the peace here. I'm gonna lay down two things right now and back up all the way. The first one's this. Any man starts a shootin' scrape I'll kill, 'less he kills me first. Number two is what the Citizens' Committee has agreed to. If a man makes trouble and goes on making it, he's gonna see himself posted out of town. That's what they call in some towns a white affidavit. It's backed by me. Any man posted comes in here comes in against me. That's all I've got to say, McQuown. Hear! Hear! Blaisedell! - Go for your iron, Blaisedell. - Billy! - Go along, son. - Let's go, Billy. Gimme. That wasn't so hard, was it, Morg? You know, I thought they'd never leave. - Abe? - Why, you dirty, yellow-liver. - I oughta cut that stinking throat. - Stop it! Stop it! One of these days, I'm gonna shoot that hand off. All right. Stop it, Johnny. Let's not stand around squallin' at each other. I knew about Cade. Now I know about you. You're back-shooters, both of you. That's enough, Johnny. It's bad enough we're runnin' back to San Pablo, our tails between our legs. - I just want to make it plain. - Shut up, Johnny. Just shut up. Coming, Johnny? No, Billy. I guess I'll be stayin' in town. - Afternoon, Mr. Gannon. - Hello, Mr. Morgan. Appears like you and me are social pariahs. What do you mean? We're the only two in town not invited to the wedding. Yeah. Me because I'm a no-good gambler, you because you're a no-good San Pabloite. I'm not a San Pabloite... not anymore. It's a pity they don't believe you, just as they don't believe me. Weddings! You don't like 'em, huh? Mr. Gannon, we pretend to be free men, yet when conventionality spreads its net out fold by fold, we eagerly approach those pretty meshes that bind us to domesticity. You, uh, read that in a book somewhere? I-I think I just made it up. What I'm trying to say, Mr. Gannon, is that civilization is stalking Warlock. Mr. Morgan? I'm Phin Jiggs. Ed Hamilton sent me down from Fort James. Come inside. ♪ Where sorrow ♪ ♪ Is unknown ♪ Maybe you gentlemen feel things have improved in Warlock. - And maybe your safety has improved. - It certainly has. Not one drop of bloodshed in town since the marshal here took over. - That's right. - Well, it ain't the same outside of town. Lost a thousand head of stock in two months. Understand I ain't holdin' McQuown responsible, but I hear he's shippin' a lot of cattle recently. It's not only rustling that's cropping up. There's so many road agents out, only yesterday I told my drivers not to resist a holdup. From now on, I carry no shipments of any value. Today's the last bank shipment, and I wouldn't count on that gettin' through. I'm makin' no accusations, but if I were the marshal, I'd get out after a couple of boys named Benner and Friendly. And what would you do, take them to Bright's City, where a jury of 12 trembling fools under the eye of McQuown would let 'em off? - Allow me, Miss Marlow. - Thank you. - May I join you? - Of course. I enjoyed your playing, Miss Marlow, and your singin'. - Thank you. - You have a light, sensitive touch. - My mother played the melodeon. - Oh? Yes, even killers and gunmen have mothers, Miss Marlow. And I'm sure you loved and respected her. Yes, ma'am. Mr. Blaisedell... I think I owe you an apology. Whatever for, Miss Marlow? Dr. Wagner told me word for word what you did against McQuown and his men. You've done what nobody else even came close to doing without firing a shot. I did it only to convince you I'm not the wickedest man in the West. Anyway, I respect that, and I admire you for it. My father hated violence. - He opened up the mines here, didn't he? - Yes. Well, anyway, Mr. Blaisedell, will you accept my apology? You see? It's happening. I warned you about that in my first meeting with the committee... about people changing their minds about me, I mean. You said that people would get to fear and resent you. People that liked and wanted me would. People that disliked me would... Change, Miss Marlow. It's inevitable. But it goes both ways. - Does that worry you? - No, ma'am. Not at all. You see, it has compensations. How many on the stage? Three. Her and him and that little sawed-off from the bank in Bright's City. There must be money in the box. She could be in danger of a holdup. You'd better leave now, and you tell Ed thanks. I wasn't plannin' on goin' right back. Get a fresh horse at the livery stable. Just tell them you work for me. Thanks, Morgan. Ed said you'd be pleased to hear it. Oh, yes, I'm pleased. Oh, Murch, have my horse saddled. Hyah! Giddap! Hyah! Hah! Here it comes! Hyah! Hyah! Giddap! Hyah! Giddap! Giddap! Hyah! Giddap! Giddap! Hyah! Reach! Throw it down! Box down. Let's see what the passengers got. Calhoun! Calhoun! Friendly! Friendly! Good luck, Mary! Hyah! Get the doc! Get the doc! - Henry, get the doctor! - Get the doctor! Get the doc! Hyah! Whoa! Hah! - What happened? - Threw down on us at Road-Agent Rock. Shot a passenger. The team took off, so we run for it. One of them was Pony Benner, I hope to spit. The little one was Pony, all right. The other one was Billy Gannon. If we ride to hit the river low down, we could head them. Marshal, you deputize me and I'm your man. - I'll ride with you, Marshal. - Jack, get some horses ready, will you? - You say there were two of them? - Pony Benner and Bill. There were three of them. I only saw two. There were three. There was one up on the ridge. This is the one that killed the big fellow? What big fellow? My friend's name was Nicholson. Bob Nicholson. A brother to Ben Nicholson of Texas. We had to let him lay when the team took off wild. Marshal, I'd like to go with you. Didn't you hear, Gannon? One of them was your brother. I said I'd like to go, Marshal. I'll ask you to ride out after the passenger. - I'd rather not. - Somebody has to. I'm asking you. Well, boys, let's go see what San Pablo looks like. Welcome to Warlock, Miss, uh... So you couldn't get along without me, huh, Lily? You should have let me know you were comin'. - Didn't you know? - No. I'd have had a brass band out. Didn't you? Didn't you? Won't you come into my parlor? Remind you of home, Lily? I was on the stage this afternoon when it was held up. Well, that must have been very exciting. - A man was killed. - Yeah, so I heard. Somebody said he looked like a... like a high roller. He wasn't with you, was he, Lily? It was Ben Nicholson's brother. Well. I went more than 5,000 miles looking for Ben Nicholson's brother. Lily, Lily. How you run through those Nicholsons. Haven't you had enough of killing? Not till I see Blaisedell shot down. Wherever he goes, I'll follow him and see him shot down... for taking away the only chance I ever had, for killing the only decent man I ever knew. You have decency mixed up. Here. There is one decent man, but hell has turned you loose on him. Ben Nicholson was a cheap gunman. He came after Clay, called him out and drew first. You put Clay up to it. If you really believe that, then you should get somebody to shoot me down. No. There'd be no satisfaction for me in that. You don't care about yourself. But you do care about Clay. And when he's dead and in the dust, I'll look at you over his body and laugh. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. You'd better leave Warlock. You'd like me to go. You'd give a lot, wouldn't you? I'd give a lot more to have you come back to me, Lily. For what? So that you could send me back to work whenever you run short of money? I thought you did it because you loved me. How could I have ever? You cripple! The posse's back! The posse's back! They got the barber killer! Pike, you and Slavin take him inside. They got Benner! Pony Benner, the barber killer! - Any trouble? - They came like lambs, with Abe McQuown spoutin' scripture about truth and justice. Sure, and he's already on his way to Bright's - to make sure he gets the right jury. - That's out of our hands. - I sent Sam Brown up for the sheriff. - Let's hang him, Marshal! - It'd save the sheriff a trip down here. - Foss. - Yeah, Marshal, let's hang him! - Yeah, hang him! Hang him! Slavin, I deputize you to guard 'em till the sheriff gets here. Use as many men as you need. Out of the way. Come on! Get out of here! This isn't an assembly hall. - What's he doin' here? - Out! Out! Let's hang 'em now! Let's hang 'em! I expect they mean to make trouble from the sound of them. No, I don't think so. Just the same, we'd better stay here. - You'd better go, Gannon. - I just wanna talk to my brother. You got the wrong guy, I tell ya. I had nothin' to do with it. You're better with a Winchester than you are with your mouth, Calhoun. But I wasn't even there! Go on, Pony, tell him! They're howling up some trouble down there. Yeah, sounds like. Saw someone today to shock a man. Yeah. - You seen her? - Yeah. People I'd rather see in Warlock than Lily. - How. - How. And the passenger the road agent shot... Ben Nicholson's brother. Came after me, I guess. Well, those San Pablo boys did you, uh, a favor, huh? Yeah. You know, I never could figure that Ben Nicholson gunnin' for me. He'd settled down on a ranch. There was even talk of him and Lily gettin' married. Well, there was talk of a lot of men and Lily. Ben Nicholson was a man with pride. He, uh... He had to be top man, so he tried you out, that's all. Is that all? He had a reputation, but he wasn't that kind. I'd hate to think there was no reason for me to kill Ben Nicholson. He was on the prowl for you. He came gunnin' for you. And now his brother comes after you. - Is it that simple? - Clay, it's that simple. Hold it! Hold it! I'll tell you just once. Get out of here before I shoot! - You can't stop us. - You see if I don't. If you think a bunch of drunks and wild bull-prods are gonna bust this jail, you're mistaken! Now, get out of here! We'll tromp you down, Slavin. What's Johnny Gannon doin' here? - He's one of 'em, ain't he? - I said git! Johnny, give us somethin' to stand 'em off with! - Need another man? - We surely do. We surely do, Clay. We're takin' those road agents out to hang, Blaisedell. And you ain't gonna stop us! We'll tromp you down like the rest! Come here and tromp me, Fitz. Come here. Come here! This ain't none of your put-in, Marshal. Come here. You've done McQuown's work tonight, Blaisedell. You got anything to say, step up and say it. Otherwise, go home. All of you, go home! And while you're doin' it... think how bein' in a lynch mob is as low a thing as a man can do. Thank you, Marshal. Thank you kindly. No, I have to thank you. It was my job. There's a man. Why don't you bring his boots, and we'll kiss 'em for 'im like he wants. Like you all do! Bring us his boots! He just saved your life, Billy. I wonder why. Mr. Richardson, you'll see to it that any witnesses against him get up to Bright's for the trial. A lot of good that'll do, Sheriff. If you thought that, why didn't you let the mob have him the other night? We don't do things that way in Warlock. Oh, we don't? Hear you get paid 400 a month, Mr. Blaisedell. You and Morgan, quite a team. Hear you have silk sheets from China. I get 100 a month for being legal sheriff, plus rheumatism from sleepin' cold nights. Mr. Blaisedell, I've heard a lot about you. The way I figure, you operate outside the law same as those cowboys. What law? When do you ever come down here? Why aren't we supplied with enough deputies? Job's open. You can have all the deputies you want. Well, you want the job, Buck? For what? $40 a month and a free pine box? How about you, Mr. Blaisedell? You wanna try doin' it legal for once? Sorry, Sheriff. The principle appeals to me, but the pay doesn't. Any man here ready to be deputy? Or is everyone here in Warlock chicken-livered or too greedy? You want law in this town, I offer you law! Just don't come whinin' to me when there's trouble. And watch yourselves when you go hirin' outside gunmen who make a livin' by killing! Well, anybody? All right, then. I'll take the job. - You, Johnny Gannon? - What? If you think I can do it. Sure, you can do it, Johnny. Sure, you can. Come inside. - Keller, you can't do this. - Why can't I? - He's one of them. - I've known Johnny Gannon all his life. He seems to have been a good boy. Maybe a little wild, but you can't condemn a man for that. Further, you can't condemn a man for his brother or his friends. What's more, he volunteered when no one else did. So I'm makin' him the new deputy of Warlock. - And he'll be that till I remove him. - Or he's carried out. You know you're putting him up against Blaisedell. Against any lawbreakers. You understand that, don't you, Johnny? - I understand. - Fine. Well, adios, gentlemen. Well, looks like the law's coming back to Warlock. But for how long, Judge? Miss Dollar. I, uh, just saw you comin' up here. - You're the new deputy. - Yes, ma'am. My name's John Gannon. I, uh... Well, I thought if I might ask you a few questions. Look, those boys were let off at Bright's, you know... acquitted. - Isn't that what everybody expected? - Yes, ma'am. But I'd like to know who killed your Mr. Nicholson. He wasn't mine. Oh. Well, you... y-you said there was a third man. - A shot came from behind some rocks? - So it did. - But what's the difference? They got off. - Yes, ma'am, but I'd still like to know. Of course you would. Your brother was one of 'em, wasn't he? They're your friends. I... I'm not one of 'em, Miss Dollar. All right. Suppose I told you I know who killed him. What would you do? I'd go after him. Do you know? No. There's very little I know. I'm a woman. I only feel things. And you're a deputy, and you want answers to questions. - And I tell you, it doesn't matter. - But it does matter! The Citizens' Committee's meetin' right now. A-And those men from San Pablo'll be posted out of town. - By Clay Blaisedell? - Yes, ma'am, and if they didn't do it... - Well, it just ain't right. - Your brother's just a boy, isn't he? He's 19. No. No, he's not a boy. But that's not really why I care. - No? - No, ma'am. You see, I'm the deputy sheriff. And if Clay Blaisedell goes after him... well, I... I just believe it's my job to keep the law. - You'd go against Blaisedell? - If I have to. You see, I'm not a boy either, Miss Dollar. Mr. Gannon. I'm sorry. I've rented a house. Pretty fair house. I rented it from Mr. Petrix. And, uh, some of the boys from the livery stable are droppin' my trunks around this afternoon. I wonder if you'd help me move in. Well, sure. Sure, I'd, uh, like to help, Miss Dollar. - Around 5:00. - All right. - I'll try cookin' some supper for us. - Fine. You don't have to look so worried, Deputy. I can cook. - Good evening. - Good evening, Deputy. I thought you'd come dressed for work. Well, you said work and supper, so, uh, I wasn't just sure. - So I did. Come on in. - Thanks. This is a nice place. There'll be no supper till all the work's done. All right. What would you like me to do first? You can start by putting those trunks in my bedroom. Yes, ma'am. Hey, that smells mighty good, Miss Dollar. - Corn bread, meat and greens. - Oh, fine. Well, guess there's not many men in Warlock eatin' home-cooked food tonight. - Keep working, Deputy. - Oh. Yes, ma'am. Oh. That was mighty good. You didn't finish your greens, Mr. Gannon. My mother used to say that. It's a thing women say. - Where is she? - She's dead, Miss Dollar. - Lily. Just Lily. - Oh. Well, she died... Oh, I don't know, about, uh, 19 years ago, back in Nebraska. - And your father? - The Apaches killed him. That was in the early days out here. And Blaisedell's going to kill your brother and the others. - If they come into town. - You know they'll come in. You, uh... You knew Blaisedell back in Fort James, didn't you? Long before Fort James. I knew Morgan. And if you knew Morgan, you knew Blaisedell. He dealt faro for Morgan. And people knew he was a killer right from the start. He was a colonel in the army at 21, and he never quit being a colonel. All he knows is killin'. What sort of man is this McQuown? Worse than he ought to be, and he's gettin' worse all the time. I used to think pretty high of him. But you left, and your brother stayed on. That's right. - I left. - Why? - Oh, a lot of reasons. - What reasons? I-I-I've never told anybody this before, but... about eight or 10 months ago, some Mexicans were supposed to have been massacred by Apaches down in Rattlesnake Canyon. At least, everybody said it was Apaches. But it wasn't? No. No, it wasn't. You see, we'd... we'd rustled more than a thousand head down at Haciendo Puerto across the border, but those Mexicans trailed us back here. So one night a bunch of us stripped down, smeared ourselves with mud, and boxed them up in Rattlesnake Canyon. We killed 'em all... 37 of 'em. Thirty-seven. I-I don't know. It was kind of like a... kind of like a dream. I'll never forget layin' there sweatin', covered with mud, waitin' for 'em. It was so quiet. Then they came. Abe gave the signal. We all started to fire. It-It was just awful. I-I don't think they... they got off a single shot. All around me, Abe and all the rest of 'em were screamin' like Apaches and firin' down into the canyon till there wasn't anybody left to shoot. I-I'd say it was like a dream, but it wasn't a dream. It was real. It just happened that way. Good afternoon, Miss Jessie. I was just out riding on my way to Medusa Mine, as a matter of fact, and I heard the shots. I had no idea it was you. - My, it's hot today! - Yes, ma'am. It certainly is. - Not nearly as hot as yesterday, though. - No, not nearly. Though I heard someone say as I was leavin' town... Buck Slavin, it was... that he thought today was hotter. - Matter of opinion, I guess. - Course. Purely a matter of opinion. Would you happen to have some water in that canteen of yours? - This heat makes one terribly thirsty. - Well, yes, ma'am. I do. That's all right, Marshal. I can drink right from the canteen. You were just out riding, you said. On my way to the Medusa Mine. That mountain water certainly makes one feel much cooler. Yes, ma'am. It generally does. What are you doing out here, anyway? Not shooting at bad men, are you? - No. Practicin'. - Practicing? Yes, ma'am. Just like you practice on the pianos, I practice on the Colts. The stakes are a little different, but the reason's the same. What should we talk about now, Miss Jessie? The men you posted are coming into town. Thank you for warnin' me, but I've already heard. Why does it have to happen? Why do these things always have to end in bloodshed? Well, that's how things are, Miss Jessie. That's why I was hired, why you hired me. And so they'll come into town, and you'll shoot them all down dog-dead in the street, is that it? Or them me. Or them you? Understand, Miss Jessie. I enjoy being marshal. I'm a simple man, good only with Colts. That's all I am... handy with Colts. Besides, bein' marshal's kind of a habit. Habits are hard to break. I know about habits. Before my father died, he was sick for nine years, and I nursed him all that time. I guess I have the nursing habit, because... that summer there was a typhoid epidemic, and I turned the house into a hospital. Then there were the injured miners and... It's strange. When I came to Warlock a very young girl, I had dreams that someday I'd be a someone. My father kept telling me I'd be a someone. Why, you're a someone, Miss Jessie. - You're the miner's angel. - Don't say that. - I hate being an angel. - Why, Miss Jessie. I wish you had whiskey in that canteen. I'd show you how much of an angel I am. - Have you ever tasted whiskey? - Many times. How many? Once. - I wanted you to do that. - I know. - I came out here to find you. - I know. Is that dreadful of me? Dreadful. It's cooked just right, Jessie. Takes a while to get used to a man's tastes. My father used to like his meat just barely scorched. Chicken-fried... it's the only way. Clay, why must those cowboys come into town? Because they've been declared guilty-as-sin road agents. To every man, they know it. They're that if they stay out, yellow bellies, besides. If they come in, they'll think they're genuine, gilt-edged heroes, provin' they're innocent, strikin' a blow for freedom too. Men have died for that many's a time. I'll fix your eggs. Oh, morning, miss. Is the marshal available? Will you please inform him there are three murdering cowboys in town come to call him out? - Come in, Morg. Have a cup of coffee. - No, thank you. There isn't time. - Where are they? - Down at the Lucky Dollar. Maybe I'd better go see what they want. - You haven't had your breakfast yet. - It's just as well, miss. If he's gonna take a stomach wound, it's just as well if he hasn't eaten any food. Keep the coffee hot for me, Jessie. I'll be back. Clay? I'll make you a fresh breakfast when you come back. Thank you. Morg, I got an idea we're gonna see a finish to the McQuowns this morning. Yeah. Then we can move on. Where to? Oh, a fella dropped in last night from Porphery City. Sounds just like it's made for us... wide-open, booming with a gold strike. We ought to take a look. - I don't think so, Morg. Not this time. - What do you mean? Jessie and I are gonna get married. Oh, yeah? When? Couple of weeks, as soon as I can get a preacher down from Bright's City. Well, guess I'll be going to Porphery City alone, huh? Why do you have to go, Morg? That's the way I've always done it, the way it's always been. - You do a job, you move on to the next. - This time it's different. Blaisedell, reach! It's a bad mornin' for thinkin'. You know, thinkin' of weddings can lead to a funeral. Shall we, Marshal? Thank you, Mr. Morgan. - We're with ya, Marshal! - Good luck, Marshal! If I can help, Marshal. Deputy! - Marshal, give me time to talk to 'em. - What good would it do? - One of 'em's my brother. - We're wastin' time. - We have to move now, Clay. - It's my fight, Deputy. They called me out. You know that, don't you? Yes, I know that. All right, Deputy. Go ahead. Thanks. - Throwin' in with us, eh? - Blaisedell send you to beg us off? Billy, you can't do this. Oh. Well, Calhoun weaseled. I guess you're doin' the same. Look, Blaisedell saved you from that lynch mob and he could've killed you that night in the French Palace! - Oh, what happened that night... - There's no need for this! - There's no reason! - Reason enough... to stand up and be a man! This is a free territory, and wild gunmen like Blaisedell - are tryin' to make it not. - Billy, you're talkin' Abe's foolishness. - He'll kill ya! - Well, I'm not scared of him. Are you, Johnny? I'm scared of dyin', just like any man. And so are you, Billy. I, uh... I just wanna know what you're gonna do. Are you gonna back me or Blaisedell? I won't back him, 'cause you're my brother. And I won't back you, 'cause you're wrong. Pony said it would be no use. Come on, Blaisedell! Billy, don't! You don't have to fight me, Billy. You and your partners just mount up and ride out. Go for your gun. Don't make me kill you, boys. Clear on out of here. Well, go for your gun! Hey! Oh, no. Billy. Billy. Don't shoot! Don't shoot. Don't. I had nothin' to do with Calhoun bein' here. Start shootin', or get outta town! Oh, I could've killed you if they hadn't done that. We only wanted to talk. Pike. Mr. Richardson. Mr. Petrix. - We only wanted to talk. - Friendly! Three hits... one through the throat, two not a finger apart through the heart. Well, I must be losing my touch. All three were chest-aimed. Hey, Clay. Clay, y-you've been hit. Is that true, Marshal, what Friendly said? You saw it, Mr. Petrix. Did it look like they came to talk? Let's go home and have Murch fix that up, huh? I'll take it to Miss Jessie's. Doc'll fix it up while I finish my breakfast. You got... You got... Y-You gotta tell everybody, Johnny. - Yes, Billy. - I didn't know. Yes, Billy. Billy. Billy, Billy, Billy. Billy. Uh-oh. - Evenin', Mr. Marshal. - You McQuown's messenger boy now? Why, no, sir. This poster here is my work. Excellent letterin' and spellin', don't you think? But not your idea, I hope. No, sir. I have to give Abe full credit for that. "Chief of regulators." That's a fancy title. You think that one up? No, sir. Once again, Abe gets the credit. He said that if Warlock could appoint themselves a marshal, outside the law, well, then, he figured somebody could appoint a chief of regulators. And who would that someone be? That would be the Cowboy's Council for the Protection of San Pablo. I made that title up. You know, this could get to be quite a thing, Mr. Marshal. The town of Warlock appoints a marshal. He comes in and kills a whole bunch of us cowboys. And we appoint regulators, and we kill you. And the town gets another marshal, and he kills more cowboys. And we appoint... Well, you can see how it'd go back and forth and forth and back for all times. It'd be kind of like looking into two mirrors put face-to-face. Oh, Mr. Marshal. I got so many of these. I wonder if you'd kind of like to have one just as a keepsake? Thank you. For your collection. Oh, Clay! You seen the poster, huh? You take the buggy, Jessie. I'll stay and talk to Tom. All right, Clay. Miss, maybe you'd better stay and find out what it's like being married to a marshal. If he doesn't handle this right, he's gonna be a dead man. I'm sure Clay can handle almost anything, Mr. Morgan. An army... An army's coming in. This isn't a challenge or just a test like when we first came to town. This is a war, ma'am... a war they have to win. Fifteen, 20 men, an army against two men? If you're worried about the numbers, Morg, maybe you'd better let me handle it alone. Maybe I will, Clay. Maybe you'd better go to Porphery City alone. All right, Clay. Maybe I will. Oh, miss, uh, maybe you'd like to take the Colt in his defense. Blaisedell? I just wanna tell ya that this is my job... to keep the peace. How do you propose to do that, Sheriff? I'll tell McQuown he's not to come in. He'll come in, all right. And when he does... you're not gonna fight my fight, Deputy. I guess I'll have to, Mr. Blaisedell, 'cause this is the law's business, not yours. Nor yours, Mr. Morgan. Well, looks like our problem is solved, Morg. The law's takin' over. Hey, you can't mean that. Why not? Let's see if Warlock's grown up enough to take care of itself. Clay... Clay, if-if-if you're not the marshal, you're nothin'! Ah, maybe it's time. Maybe we've run out of towns. Boys, we have a visitor. Why, if it isn't Johnny Gannon come back to San Pablo. Come in, Johnny. Don't stand there actin' like you mightn't be welcome. Kind of bad manners comin' out here with that star hangin' on you, Gannon. - Whiskey, Johnny? - No, thanks. Didn't come to drink? I came to tell ya not to come into town, Abe. - Did Blaisedell send you out here? - Nope. - Then who's the message from? - From me. You? You're tellin' us? I'm the deputy, Abe, and I'm tellin' ya. - You are posting us? - Nobody's posted. But no wild bunch callin' themselves regulators is comin' in to make trouble. Let me rip that star off him, Abe. That's the way it is, huh, Johnny? That's the way it is. Now, what do you mean comin' down on my place, tellin' me I'm not to go in there? Better look out, Abe. I rode out with him, and Johnny's getting mad. You think Blaisedell isn't gonna choose us out and cut us down one by one unless we go in there against him all together? That'd be a thing I'd be bound to stop too. Yeah. Like you stopped him from cutting Billy down. That was a fair fight, Abe. Least from Blaisedell's side it was. Billy came in to kill him. Calhoun was set to back-shoot him. - That's a lie. - No, it's the truth. I talked to Billy just before the fight, and I'd swear to what he said in any court of law. Yeah. Yeah, you'll swear all right. But you'll swear that Billy said he only wanted to talk to Blaisedell. Swear it. Swear it here and now, or I'll see your dirty lying soul in hell. I guess I won't, Abe. - Swear it. - No. - Swear to the truth, or I'll kill ya. - No. - Go on! Hit him, Abe. Cut him up! - Say it! - No! - Say it! Move, Johnny, and I'll cut it off. Don't move, Johnny. - Swear it, Johnny. - No. Abe. This isn't doin' any good, Abe. - Hold off, Abe. - Swear it, Johnny, or I swear I will kill ya. You better kill me, if you want to take your regulators into Warlock. Otherwise, I'll stop ya. Surely like to see him trying to stop us, wouldn't you, Abe? I'd like to see that, Abe. Stop us then. We'll be in tomorrow. Yeah, give it to him. He can't do anything with it anyway. I warned ya. Don't come into Warlock. Johnny. I'm the law, Curley. I'm the law. I'm alone. They comin' in? Yes, near sundown. Cade says he's gonna kill you himself, Johnny. Hmph. - I thought I saw... - It's all right, Buck. It's all right. Why'd you come in, Curley? Abe's gonna be mad. I thought maybe if you knew that they weren't comin' in till sundown, that... Well, maybe you got business in Bright's City or somethin'. Uh-uh. I'm stayin' here. You can go back and tell 'em that. - With that hand against Abe and Cade? - I'm stayin'. My, but you're brave. Oh, you're so brave. Just go back and tell 'em I'm here. You're a fool, Johnny G. Curley. Cade gonna be, uh, doin' his usual back-shootin'? Least you'll get is a fair fight, Johnny. - I promise you that. - Then tell 'em. Oh, it'd just be a waste of time. Think I'll stay around town and wait. This hand won't hold much now, especially not a Colt. Hmph. Well... then I guess I got time for some sleep now. Oh, so you'll be clear-eyed when you die? Doc, maybe you could give me some laudanum for later on, will ya? Six drops in a glass of water. You've set yourself against McQuown and Blaisedell. You'll be killed! You know that! Yes. Come in. Lady to see you, Mr. Blaisedell. Come in, Lily. I've come to ask you for something... a favor. I want Gannon for Ben Nicholson. - You owe me this, Clay. - I owe nothing. Ben Nicholson came after me. He called me out. Don't you know he went to see Morgan first? Morgan sent him! Aw, I don't believe that. Well, that's not important anymore. I don't care about that. I don't even care about Ben Nicholson anymore, Lord help me. I only want an end to this killing. I've hated you and wanted you killed... but I don't want that anymore. Oh, Clay, I was wondering if... Well, well, well. Hello, Lily. What she come to do, uh, shoot you or poison you, Clay? - What'd she want? - She's worried about Gannon. Oh, is that all? - Morg? - Yeah? You talk to Ben Nicholson the day he died? Now, what would I have to do with Ben Nicholson? - What did you tell him? - None of your business. You come here again and talk to Clay behind my back, and I'll kill ya. I'll kill anybody that's dangerous to Clay. Even you, Lily. Tom, why do you do this? Because he's the only person, man or woman, who looked at me and didn't see a cripple. Get outta here. Better say a prayer for the soul of your deputy. That's not too bad, huh? It's not too good either. Oh, I never was very fast, but I can shoot well enough. Well enough may not be good enough. - Afternoon, Deputy. - Hello, Mr. Blaisedell. I guess I'll be gettin' some early supper. Blaisedell, if you've come to offer us help, we don't want ya. "We"? Hadn't you better let Gannon decide that? Don't you understand that as long as you stay here, there'll be killing? You're a target, a symbol, and they must come after you. - Let us alone, Blaisedell. - Come on, Judge. Come on. Mind if I sit? Go ahead. - How's your hand? - It's all right. I remember when I first killed a man. It was clear and had to be done. Though I went home afterwards and puked my insides out. I remember how clear it was. Afterwards, nothing was ever clear again, 'cept for one thing. That's to hold strictly to the rules. It's only the rules that matter. Hold onto 'em like you were walkin' on eggs, so you know yourself you've played it as fair and as best you could. But there are things to watch for... in yourself. Don't be too fast. When there are people after you and you know it and you worry it, then you think, "If I don't get drawn first and then kill first..." You know what I mean? I know. Can you draw with that hand, Deputy? I can. Let's see ya draw. This evenin', there'll be a lot against ya. I'd be honored if... you'd accept my offer to help, just to back you up, Deputy. Mr. Blaisedell, maybe I'd like your help more than anything in the world. But it's time this town stood on its own. Who knows? Maybe the people of Warlock will help by backin' the law. I wouldn't count on that, Deputy. But I'll be there to back ya. Will you come out and have a whiskey with me? No, thanks. Maybe later. Right now, I've... I've got things to do. Sure is noisy out there today. Yeah. Little boys waiting for their circus parade. - How. - How. Lily is sure gone on that deputy. Yeah. Pity she won't have him long. Unless we take a hand. Meanin' what? Remember that time in Grand Ford when those strangers had us in a hotel room with a guard? Lily splashed a can of kerosene around out in back. Came runnin' upstairs hollerin', "Fire!" She sure got us out of that one. I think we owe her one, Morg. You know, that's funny. That's very funny. You've practically given up marshaling this town. The only way for you to be important again is for Gannon to die. Now you wanna back Gannon, so he'll be the hero and you'll be nothin'? That's-That's very funny. I'm not playin' king of the mountain, Morg. It's not a question of who's on top, who's on the bottom, but this town holdin' together against McQuown. I'm a citizen of this town... If you wanna play second fiddle, that's your business. But don't expect me to back you. I've never asked your help before, Morg. Clay, how do you think you stayed alive this long? They're here, Morg. You're not goin' out there to save Gannon. After he's dead, they'll come beggin' for you to protect 'em. Now, just, uh, sit down and wait, Clay. Blaisedell was right. He said I'd put too much on you. - Now I've done it. - You've put nothin' on me. It's just a time and a place for a showdown. You know that. You haven't a chance, unless you let Blaisedell help you. Well, Judge, if a deputy's gonna be worth anything, he can't hole up when there's trouble. Oh, you're nothing to me, boy. You're just a badge and office, that's all ya are. Get yourself killed. It's nothing to me. Abe, I give ya five minutes to leave town. Johnny, go for your gun, you yellow-livered coward! - Kill him! - Go for it! - Hold it! - Hold it! Drop your gun! Take it easy, Joe! I promised you, Johnny. Promised you a fair fight. You regulators are all under arrest! Brown. You, Bush, Moseby. You're deputized to take 'em into Bright's City for trial! Now we'll see how far the law can go in Warlock. - You gambled and lost, Morg. - Well, at least you're alive. Am I? Do you think they would've backed you like they did Gannon? That's what they pay you for, half hopin' to see you killed. Wouldn't that be better if I go down decently? Isn't that what you've always said, Morg? - And I've kept it from ya many a time. - Like now! With a gun on me? No, like the time on the Hynes bunch in Fort James. It was me... me that got the drop on 'em. And the Allisons in Silver Wells? Me, again. And Calhoun down below ready to back-shoot you? - Who saved your life? It was me. - And Bob Nicholson at the stage? And Bob Nicholson. And Ben Nicholson too. Lily was tellin' the truth. You used me to get back at Lily. Lily had nothin' to do with it. - He was gunnin' for you. - Morg! You're tellin' me things to make me kill ya. I'm goin' to Jessie's. I'll send for my things. We'll talk about that later. Clay. You got to face Gannon. - You got to let him know you're in charge! - Gannon's in charge. I'm resigning. Or would ya have me kill Gannon too because of Lily? - That's not why I did those things. - No? Then why? Why? Was it ever for me? Or you, Morg? No, not for me, Clay. You're my friend. - You're the only friend I ever had, Clay. - You're finished, Morg. Clay! You won't face Gannon because you're yellow! You're yellow clean through! Miss Jessie Marlow's made ya like that! Clay, I'm not the cripple here. You are. Clay, if you don't kill Gannon, I will. Clay, I swear I will! Murch. Murch! Bring me some whiskey. "Tomorrow, tomorrow... and tomorrow... creeps in this... this petty pace from... day to day... to the last syllable of recorded time." Murch, give me your Colts. - Look, boss, you-you've been drinking. - I said, give me your Colts. I'm the black rattlesnake of the whole territory! I'll kill anything that moves. So just sit still or die! And if you move... you crawl. Who wants to die? I've got lightning in both hands. I'm just spoilin' for a fight! I'll kill anything that moves! I've killed 45 men, and tonight I'm gonna run up that score! Where is that brave deputy... that... that great cowboy killer? What he's doin', hidin'? Gannon! I'm the all-time "champeen" cowboy killer! Sorry, Deputy. Drop it right there. Get inside the cage. - What is this? - Inside! What do you think you're doin'? You're a brave man, Deputy, but Tom Morgan's my responsibility. Blaisedell! Gannon! Crawl out of your hole, you yellow-belly, and I'll run ya outta town! Gannon, do I have to come in after you? Morgan! Morg! Hello, Clay. - Oh, let me kill him, Clay. - No, Morg. Why? Because you think you owe Lily? This isn't a game you can cheat and make a fraud of, Morg! Now, I'm gonna have to run you out of town. W-Well, then I won. Clay, you-you run me out of town, I'll go like a lamb. You'll be a hero again. That-That's all I want, Clay. I've won. All right, you've won. We'll play this out to the end just as you want it. I'm telling you to leave town. All right. I'll see you in Porphery City, Marshal. - No, you won't, Morg. - Oh, yeah. - You'll be there. - No, Morg. I'll be waiting for you. - Good-bye! - Good-bye! Yellow coyote of Warlock! Good-bye! Yellow coyote of Warlock! Bye! Bye! - Good-bye. - I'm gonna tell you something, Clay. What is it, Morg? I'm better than you. I've always been better. I can beat you, Clay. Now, you hit it, and you'd better hit it fast. I won, Clay. I won. - Don't push! - Get back! Get your hands off him. Say something. Say something! He'd have killed somebody. He broke my arm for me. He was after trouble. What are you worth? He was out to kill somebody, Marshal. - Who? You? - It might have been me, I guess. - What are you worth? - Oh, Lord, deliver us. Judge me. You judged him. Judge me now. Judge me! What will you do, kill all of us for your pain? I've had too much of you. Crawl for it! Crawl past him who was a man, not all talk. Take your hats off. Take your hats off! And now you can sing. ♪ Rock of ages cleft ♪ Sing! ♪ Let me hide myself in thee ♪ ♪ Let the water and the blood ♪ ♪ From thy wounded side which flowed ♪ ♪ Be of sin the double cure ♪ ♪ Save me from its guilt and power ♪ Stand back. Get the water wagon! He's burning the place down! Get the water wagon! Get the water wagon! Get that water wagon! Bring that water wagon! Johnny, he'll kill you! Stand back, Deputy. - Sorry, Blaisedell. It's time. - Time? You can't stay here. Trouble and death follow you. - Warlock's had enough of both. - Are you running me out of town? No. I'm just sayin' I'll have to arrest you in the morning. So I'm askin' you to get out before then. Nobody tells me that or asks me. I come and go as I please. No longer, Mr. Blaisedell. I'll have to come after you in the morning. Come shootin' if you do. - I'll do that. - You'll have to. I told Blaisedell he's to get out of town by morning. I heard. And is he going? No. What do you want... your whole life in one night? Johnny. Oh, Johnny. Clay. I've been looking for you. Have you been here all this time? Jessie, Jessie, why did he do it? I don't know. Clay, what are you going to do? Yesterday... Was it only yesterday? I told him he was nothing without me. Maybe I'm nothing without him. That's foolish. Clay, we had a council meeting tonight, and everyone was agreed that if you wanted to stay here in town, we could go to the deputy. - I'm sure that there'd be no problem. - What would I do here, Jessie? - Stay with me as we planned. - What would I do? I don't know. Whatever you planned on doing before this happened. I never saw past this morning. I suppose I figured Morgan and I... But what now? Should I clerk in Richardson's store? Sell needles to old ladies? Should I take over McQuown's spread and nurse calves? Become a miner and live in darkness? If you loved me, Clay, none of these things would be bad. Jessie, come with me. We'll go to Porphery City. I can become the marshal there. And to another town, and another and another. Why not? It's the way I've lived. It's the way I'll always live. Times are changing, sure, but there'll be enough towns to last my lifetime. I'm not Morgan. I can't back you. I can't even hold a Colt, much less fire one. Who will kill the back-shooters in Porphery City? Maybe I'll have to find another Morgan. Morning. Johnny. There's the key. The judge has got the other one in there. Take care of that, now. People are out. Funny how they find out about things. Yeah. Well... I guess it's about time. Chilly out. Yeah.
