You got off easy. Of course. Did you ever imagine how it would be... What do you want? Just a simple favour. Money? Cold. - Dope doesn't fly anymore. I took big risks for you. What am I to do with this picture? I like this chick. Is this your stake? That's probably not my decision. Think long and hard about it. I want you to act as a killer for her. All you need is a gun and imagination. A bad movie. That's the plan. And what's the point? Is it so hard to get? You look like a killer but you are no killer. The gun's empty but she doesn't know. As soon as she'll realize it... it will put an end to her fantasizing. Why don't you leave her alone? I don't want to lose her. A FILM BY Cinema Goetheplatz, one moment please. Number 14, Row D for two. How may I help you? I'd like to get to know you. Not necessary. I already know you. That's impossible. In the theatre everything's possible. I heard your voice a hundred times. I know what you look like. So you'll recognise me later in the Ramona Bar. We'll see. Yes? - Two for Cinema C. Sold not a single ice cream. One guy wanted a 500 Marks bill changed. No chance! Why do you get riled up? It's all just a show anyhow. How many are in? About eighty. Please come into my office later. Cinema Goetheplatz. What kind of movie, is it the one tomorrow at 10:30 P.M.? 10:30 P.M. tomorrow? Horror. - A horror movie. That's not my cup of tea. Is there sex in it? Depends on you. A man gets buried alive. Ah, that one... That jerk hung up. Fuck. I'm happy you're here. Me too. Would be nice if you'd be here more often. A rare occasion. Know what we'll do? We go to Acapulco to break the bank. And with the money we open up a bar. And then you can invite all the celebrities you're searching for on your nightly trips. And in the bathroom you will meet... Marilyn Monroe. Ha ha, very funny. Not Marilyn Monroe but rather Porky Pig. Better. By the way, it's nice and warm in bed. Troubles? - Not more than usual. Wanna go out for a drink? I've got to run. Too bad there's no part for me in your movie. No can do. I have something planned for later. Life or business? What do you think? I've seen a wedding once where the bride was in love with another man. At the last second... Shortly before she said 'Yes'... he ran into the church and yelled her name till they both ran off. Before that, he locked the wedding guests into the church. I've seen enough. And the whole class is yelling 'Yes Miss!'. Sit down, we need to talk. - I thought we'd go to the movies. Please, no back-talking. Very well. I once knew someone who only could live by night although he wasn't really alive. He prowled the night and drank the blood of humans until they became like him. At cockcrow he had to be at his home because sunlight made him wither. Or did he melt? He turned to ash. And I'm leaving. What if we leave together? Why now all of a sudden? I'm taking a shower first. What movie did you watch? What do you mean? Did you meet someone? - No, or else I wouldn't have come. Really? No one at all? Don't ask these kind of questions. You're still in bed? What are you waiting for? I don't know. Let me drive. We need to fill up gas. Hello. - Evenin'. Fill her up, please. This is Annie. Hi Annie. I'm Johnny. Have a seat. I have to make a call. The drinks are on me. Do I have a reason? Cheers Annie. - Cheers. I'm going home. Cinema Goetheplatz. - Has the movie already started? It started 20 minutes ago. Too bad. Thanks. - You're welcome. What's up? - It's the seducing projectionist. Get B.B. on the phone, please. You're wanted on the phone. Who is it? - Three guesses. Him? What does he want? Bockmann speaking. - Darling, how are you doing? Unchanged since your last 97 calls. Kiss my ass. I won't be forming habits because of you. Jesus, who are you waiting for? For Otto? Definitely not for a Frankenstein like you. Have fun in your darkroom. Do you have to break my heart? Rather yours than mine. Any more questions? Hello? Who is this? Cinema Goetheplatz. Hello? Who is this? Maybe it was the guy I met yesterday. But how would he know I'm working here? He was a freak, let me tell you. First we went to a bar. Champagne... He paid for it all. Then he wanted to go to a hotel. A hotel room! Can you imagine? I'm no hooker! I asked him why he won't take me to his place. He said he can't go home. His wife has a lover. And in the meantime he has to take a hike. That's what I'm good for. Forget it! I asked why he isn't getting a divorce. Wanna know what he said? He still has the hots for her. You can count me out. Then he tried to kiss me. He started to grope me. Nutcase! He only bit my neck, he couldn't get any further. There's something wrong with a guy like that. Did you ever have an experience that feels just not quite right. You meet someone and some detail just does not fit. What do you mean? I'm not here! Tell Miss Bockmann to come to my office. Not him again! ...talk to the American. Maybe I'm coming. See my feet in the mirror? - Yes Think they're pretty? - Yes. Very. And my ankles? Do you like them? - Yes. My knees? I love your knees. And my thighs? Them, too. ...the guy is screwing you. Every mornin', every evenin'! As soon as I leave the door! Have you rented the whole floor? You gave me a scare. I thought you'd come earlier. Go right in. I have to straighten out something. Later! Where are those beautiful legs walking at this late hour? Alone to bed if all goes smoothly. Do you want anything? Was Richard here? - Richard... He wasn't. What about Maserati? - He left a while ago. The next one's paying. What's going on? Where do I know Richard from? Have we met him before? Ero-topa-thy. Alright, I'm leaving. Not necessary. Hello, Annie. Maybe someone else is coming too. Did Johnny leave? Don't know. I don't understand men anymore. I know a woman who waited ten years for the man she loved. She used to say: "If he wants to see me one more time he's got to come today". Sure enough he came and they wanted to leave... But at the last moment her boyfriend killed her. Because he couldn't accept it. What are you doing here? - I could ask you the same. You look like you've expected someone else. I expected no one else. I just wanted a drink with Moni. He shot her? - No, he stabbed her with a knife. What will you give me if I give this back to you? A night without me. What do you think is up with her? She's about to detach from you. How many are in? - Almost sold out. Where's Miss Bockmann? She felt sick and went out to get some air. Yeah? - It's me. He just came in. Fuck! - I told him you went out for a sec. Don't forget to switch off the lights before you leave. He's eavesdropping again. "Don't forget to switch off the lights" Blah-blah. It's going on all the time. He wouldn't say one peep. Even if we kept all the lights on. Jackass If I told a single word about him grabbing my butt he'd have a heart attack and drop dead. Idiot! I'm going to break my neck because of his stinginess! Can you explain this to me? I'm assigned to kill you. What am I supposed to do with this thing? I want you to do it for me. Right now? You've got twenty-four hours. Is this why you were looking for me? - Private issues don't matter. Let me out. You have a screw loose. So that's your movie? Good casting. Congratulations. Out! You're Miss Messerschmidt, right? - No. Of course, I know you! "Keep me in mind! Twelve hours left." You only have one chance." Someone asked for you. - What did he look like? A cute guy. - Was he here? Five minutes ago. Who was it anyways? Cinema Goetheplatz. Got a cigarette? The rear entrance is open. - Fuck. Is Marion there? - She exploded. This is the answering machine. Currently I'm not home. You have 30 seconds to leave a message. Please don't forget to leave your name. Speak now. Asshole. Take it easy! There it is in black and white. "Assassination at film opening: 'Love me or I kill Reagan.' Was John W. Hinckley trying to force the love of movie star Jodie Foster with his bloody deed?" "A man takes revenge! Repulsed by filth, violence and godlessness of the American city life he strikes out on everything wicked. He shoots down a robber and a pimp. He tells a juvenile hooker, 'If you don't love me I'll kill the president' But this does not happen... But this does not happen. In a brutal slaughter the avenger is gunned down by the Police. Showdown of the US movie Taxi Driver". The movie ends totally different. Glad you came. Can you show me how it works? Can I have a coffee? Your boyfriend is losing to Richard in the back. What do you mean 'boyfriend'? Let's go. You're out of the game. We go to your place. We go to my place. I haven't been there for two months. Is that all? To the Mathaeser Movie Palace. One ticket please. - The movie started 30 minutes ago. Doesn't matter.
