During the war in Korea, I was in command of the Fifth Air Force operating under the United Nations command. This plane was just one of the many involved in our operations. Its pilot I shall never forget. I am pleased to have been asked to introduce this motion picture, which is based on the actual experiences of this pilot, Colonel Dean Hess of the United States Air Force. The remarkable story of Colonel Hess, his poignant and often secret struggle with a problem peculiarly his own, his courage, resourcefulness and sacrifice, have long been a source of inspiration to me and to fighting men who have known him. But the story of Colonel Hess is more than a dramatic demonstration of one man's capacity for good. It is an affirmation of the essential goodness of the human spirit. For this reason, I am happy it is told. It begins in the summer of 1950, five years after the end of World War II and one month after the invasion of South Korea. It is a quiet, sunny Sunday morning in the pleasant little town of Westhampton, Ohio. And so we ask ourselves: How can we be free of guilt? Through patience and humility... will we find happiness. A broken and contrite heart, Thou will not despise. Amen. Nice sermon, Dean, though if you'll forgive my saying so, you might dwell less on guilt and more on the hope that heaven holds for us. - Mary. - Can you stay for dinner, Deacon? I'd like to, but I have to get back out to the farm. - See you next Sunday, children. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Deacon. He's right, Mary. I didn't have 'em with me today. - Dean... - No matter how hard I try, all I seem to be able to do is repeat words from a book! Words! Words aren't enough, Mary. Dean, why are you punishing yourself with these doubts? - It's not fair. - I'm trying to face the truth. I'm just not cut out to be a minister. I've tried it now for almost two years... trying to make amends. You can't forget those children in the German orphanage, can you? Never. When I became a minister, I hoped I could find a way to live with it. But I haven't. Blue Leader to Blue Flight. We're cleared on target. Arm your bombs. Okay, Killer, let's go. Dean, your bomb's stuck! Shake her loose! This is Radio Berlin. Today the Americans made another infamous raid on an undefended, quiet, little town: The peaceful hamlet of Kaiserberg. These noble Americans totally destroyed an orphanage and church, murdering 37 children! A crime so despicable that even hell won't have its perpetrator! His hands will be stained forever with innocent blood of those harmless infants! Hello. Do you speak English? A little. Was this St. Peter's Orphanage? Ja, it was, before the big raid, before your planes came. The radio said some children were killed in the raid. But the radio very often lies. It was 37 children. And no lie! - Good morning, darling. - Good morning. Oh, what a wonderful day! You working on your sermon already? It's only Monday. That's what I call indus-- This is to the Air Force, Mary. They're making some recalls, and I've decided to apply. They need experienced people for Korea. But you're needed here! No, I'm no good here. I've known it for a long time. If you do go back, shouldn't it be as a chaplain? It's bad enough to be of so little use to people here. What help could I be to wounded or dying men? Oh, Dean! How could you kill now? Don't worry. It's only for a training program, not combat. But it doesn't make sense. It doesn't! Going back to war. Why, that's where your problem began! Don't look for sense in this. You won't find it. One doesn't always have to have a clear reason for the things he does. It's just how I feel, that's all. Mary... this is what I have to do. Oh, Dean. Dean, Mary just told me. Is it true? You're going to announce-- Word came for me last night to be in Washington next week. You'll have to take over here. - Do you realize what you're doing? - Yes. You spoke to me once about the reason why a man becomes a minister. - Oh, I did? - I must tell you mine is not a good enough one, and it never has been. - Son, I-- - Look, Deacon... You knew my grandmother. You heard her tell that our family came from Germany, -from a little village near a town named Kaiserberg. -Yes, of course, but-- It was one of her greatest hopes to go back to that little church in Kaiserberg, -where her grandmother was baptized and married. -Well? She never was able to. But I was. I saw it from the air. A bombing raid I was on. There was an orphanage next to that church, full of children who only knew that war had come to frighten them; a nightmare that might kill them. I made their fears come true with one flick of this thumb on a bomb release. I'm sorry, son. I... I never knew, never. But I do think you're acting rashly. We'll have to talk this over at a more convenient time. It's useless, Deacon. Would you please make the announcement and take over the service? Well... all right, Dean. If you wish it. Thank you, Sergeant. - I'm Colonel Hess. - Good morning, Colonel. Ben Harrison, General's Aide. Have a good trip? A fast one, thank you. General in? - That you, Dean? - Yes, sir! Come in. Let me have a look at you. Well, it's been a long time. Sit down. - Thank you, sir. - How are you, Dean? Fine, sir. I was glad to hear I'm to work with you again. And I'm pleased to have you, Dean. These Koreans will listen to a man with the same kind of nerve they have. That's why I called on "Killer" Hess. You're to check out some ROK pilots in the 51s, train them in our tactics. They're new to both, Dean. Besides, they're a hot bunch. They're overanxious. They've already cracked up a couple of the planes we gave them, and they won't get more. We've none to spare outside combat. I see. What sort of a T.O. will I have, sir? A half dozen officers, a complement of enlisted men. You'll be the only friendly air power based in Korea; everything else has to fly from Japan. The ground forces may call on you for support, but you simply can't oblige them. Your sole purpose is to get the ROK Air Force started, so don't risk those planes in any combat sorties. Your group is waiting for you at your headquarters: An airfield, or what's left of it, built years ago by the Japanese. Right here, a few miles from Yongsan. Good luck, Colonel. Thank you, sir. - Thank you, Sergeant. - You're welcome, sir. I'm Colonel Hess. Herman, sir. Your first sergeant. You're holding the fort by yourself? Well, Major Moore, the exec, is at breakfast, sir. And, um, the duty officer, Captain Skidmore... - Skidmore? What Skidmore? - The same one. He says you and him fought quite a war the last time out. This is your office, sir. And your quarters. - So Skidmore is still in. - Back in. He said it was too cold outside. - I mean-- - Even we retreads have our use, Sergeant. Call a meeting of all the officers. Get me the files on the officers and men, - and bring me the morning report. - Yes, sir. Ten-hut! I won't say "at ease" because it looks like that's what you've been at ever since you got here. Our mission is to give instruction to a detail of Korean pilots in our aircraft and tactics. But before they and the planes get here, I want this place cleaned up. This whole area looks like a pigsty. A helicopter couldn't even land on that runway! Any questions? Major Moore, sir. We haven't anything to work the runway, except a few hand tools from the vehicles. What about that town I came through? - That's Yongsan, sir. - Couldn't we find something there? Dean! Hiya, boy! -Hello, Skidmore. Where have you been? -Over at Yongsan. Checkin' the action. Boy, it sure ain't Paris. Aren't you duty officer today? Well, you weren't due in till tomorrow, -and there's nothing much doing around here, so-- -Major Moore! Until further orders, Yongsan is out of bounds. From now on, there's plenty to do around here. Any other questions? Come on, Sergeant. So that's the buddy-buddy you've been tellin' us about. Hey, uncle, where do we find the mayor? The mayor? Kingpin? Big Chief Head Wheel? Hmm? - Boss man? - "Boss man"? Sounds like you rang the bell. Boss man? See? He's not here. He must be out to lunch. Now, listen, I, um... um, need help. Bulldozer. Push dirt. You know, push dirt? Big landing strip, for planes! Pardon me. Well, hello! - Can I be of any help? - It seems we need it, - Miss... - En Soon Yang. I'm Colonel Hess. Sergeant Herman and I are trying to locate some tools for the airfield. We have to get our runway in shape before - our planes can land. - Oh. He says there is nothing left. What the enemy did not take, they destroyed. Oh. Well, where's the next town? Seosan. But I came through last week. It's burned out and destroyed like the other towns around. I see. Well, thank you, Miss Yang. Come on, Herman. Guess I should have gone through channels in the first place and put in for some engineers. Yeah, and they might get to us by the end of the war. Colonel! It seems this girl remembers seeing some sort of equipment. I think you called it a, um... - A bulldozer? - No. Uh... - Not a road scraper? - Yes, thank you. In a ditch on the road from Seosan. - Will you show us? - I must wait for the mayor, but she will take you. - Fine! - She knows exactly where it is. Good! Thank you again. Ours is the thanks, that you are with us. Put your backs to it, you slaves! I left Indiana to get away from one of these. Hey, Colonel! Our ROK pilots! - I'm Colonel Hess. - First Squadron, First Group, Air Force of the Republic of Korea reporting. - I'm Major Chong. - I'm glad to know you. General Kim has placed me in charge of our group because I have a little of your language. Wonderful. Please tell your officers we are honored to have them. Sergeant Herman here will show you to your quarters. - Yes, sir. - Thank you, sir. How soon do you think we'll be operational? Well, we can use some extra hands. - As soon as we've changed. - Very fine. - Oh, by the way, did you bring a flag? - Yes, sir. Good. We'll fly it with ours. Are you sure these guys don't know what we're saying? Without an interpreter, they're dead. They're dying rich. We haven't won a game in an hour. Not another blitz. "Got a couple of Korean pigeons," you say. "Don't speak English. We'll teach 'em Rummy and clean 'em out." Aw, it's just beginner's luck. Excuse, please. No beginner. English bad. Rummy good. Old Korean game. Skidmore, I ought to hit you on the head... till you can hold up your socks with your teeth! It's the planes! They're calling control tower - for permission to land! - Granted! Tell 'em the strip is clear! Granted! Tell 'em the strip is clear! - Only 10? - That's all. And no more where they came from. Remember that. Treat 'em like your best girl, huh? The planes are here now, and the job really begins. I just hope I'll be able to make it work. - Oh, hello, Deacon! - Good morning, Mary. - Here are your eggs. - Thanks. Won't you come in? I'd like to but Mrs. Massing is waiting for her eggs too. - I see. - From Dean? Uh-huh. He's well and seems to be getting along fine. - And you? - I? Yes, I saw you coming out of Dr. Corrigan's office. Try to keep a secret in this town. I'm-- I'm going to have a baby, Deacon. A ba-- Oh, that's wonderful! Dean will be tickled pink. Have you written him yet? No, I'm not going to tell him for a while. - Why not? - We've been disappointed before. Oh, but, Mary, he should be told. He has enough to worry about as it is. Worry? Such news would only delight him. I don't want to add to his problems. I suppose you know best. I better be running along. Now you take care of yourself. - Bye. - Goodbye. See you next week, Deacon. They're looking better every day. They're the eagerest beavers I ever saw. They don't want to stay down long enough to eat. I'd like to have those flight reports as quickly as possible. - Take care of it right away. - As soon as my head lands. Maples! - Yes, sir? - The tower tells me you made contact with enemy aircraft. Only by sight, sir. - We had to tuck our tails and run. - Yeah. Uh, you know, Colonel, it feels sort of naked up there without any experienced wing men. Their ground patrols are being reported closer every day. From now on you'll have hot guns. - Only for protection. - Roger! Hold it, hold it! Don't tell me! Something besides C-rations? Turkey for Thanksgiving, sir. Well, don't let our Korean friends see 'em! - They'll try to fly 'em! - Allow us! * Ha-ha-ha, you and me * Little brown jug don't I love thee * * Ha-ha-ha, you and me * Little brown jug don't I love thee * * 'Tis you who makes my friends and foes * * 'Tis you who makes me wear old clothes * * Here you are so near my nose * * So tip her up and down she goes * * Ha-ha-ha, you and me * Little brown jug don't I love thee * * Ha-ha-ha, you and me * Little brown jug don't I love thee * You know, back home Pa always said grace at Thanksgiving. Not that we were extra religious, it's just that Thanksgiving is special to farm folk. You know, if we had a good year, the table would be piled so high with food that you could hear the joints creak. Look, fellas, I'm not very good at this sort of thing. Somebody here feel more qualified? It seems as though I'm stuck. Dear Lord... first off, we want to thank You for all of us being well. Then I want to say that You sure did put Yourself out setting this table, all this food and drink in abundance. It seems a person never could be hungry. And if we ever get to complaining about anything, You just put a stop to it quick. - Amen. - Amen. Now while Cookie's carving that turkey, how about another song? - Thompson, "Wait for the Wagon"! - No, no! "Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair"! * Will you come with me my Phyllis, dear * * To yon blue mountain free * Where the blossoms smell the sweetest * * Come rove along with me * It's every Sunday mornin' when I am by your side * * We'll jump into the wagon * And all take a ride * Wait for the wagon, Wait for the wagon * * Wait for the wagon and we'll all take a ride * * Wait for the wagon, Wait for the wagon * * Wait for the wagon and we'll all take a ride * Anything stirring? - Everything quiet, sir. - Good. Say, why don't you go back in with the others and grab yourself something to eat? I'll take over for a while. You better hurry. The turkey will be all gone. Well, thank you, sir. - And happy Thanksgiving. - Thank you. - Same to you. - * And off we will start * Wait for the wagon Wait for the wagon * * Wait for the wagon and we'll all take a ride * Did you ever see bones picked so clean? It's a tribute to your cooking, Sergeant. These guys would eat nuts and bolts if you put some sauce on 'em! Hey, you kids! Get away there now! Scat! Scat! Go on! Go on, get outta here and stay outta here! Looks like a pretty big stick for such small boys, Sergeant. Yes, sir, but these kids are driving us nuts! They're coming down from the north in droves. They sneak on the post and steal everything they can get their hands on. They don't look like very successful thieves to me. Chong, who's that woman? She says she's trying to look after these children, orphans she has befriended. What's his name? Chu. His name is Chu. Chu. Hungry? Looks like he could use a little chow to me. Chong, take these kids to the kitchen and feed them. Yes, sir. What's he trying to do? Prove he's got a heart of gold? No, he's always liked kids, but this is idiotic. Those little sneak-thieves will be swarming out of every hole in Korea. Better nail down the furniture. Hello, Chong. Hello, Chong. This is Flight Leader. Over. Go ahead, Flight Leader. By any chance, do you know where we are? Proceeding on Mount Keijo. We'll take a heading of 84 degrees true from there. Over. Very good. Maples, how's your boy doing? Right on course. See that he holds it. This is Mosquito One, Mosquito One. Calling aircraft circling 10 miles east of Munsan. Over. This is Macintosh Leader. Go ahead, Mosquito One. Over. Got a target for you. Troop convoy at Abel-Baker-7253. Four miles east. Will you make a strike? Over. Come in, Macintosh Flight Leader. Over. Wilco, Mosquito One. Proceeding to target. Macintosh Flight, prepare for attack! -Read you, Flight Leader! -Skidmore, you know we can't risk these planes! Maintain radio silence. Follow me. Out. Okay, pour it on. Maples! Off your left wing, get that stray. Get it! What's the matter, Maples? Those kids! Oh, those poor little kids! Maples... All right, all right, so I didn't follow the rule book. But look what we handed 'em! All those troops! Enemy troops! Scratched! And strafing those refugees Can you scratch that too? It was an accident. Wars are full of accidents. You know that yourself. You know how everything looks alike from the air. Remember Germany. How many times-- That's enough! Look, Dean, I don't know what kind of a monkey you've got on your back, but don't try to put him on mine. This is serious business. You don't have to tell me how serious it is. I'm not so sure about that. Once I thought you knew what war was about, but not anymore. Just keep this one thing in mind: All that counts is who wins, not how nice a guy you are. You win or you die. You go soft, and you're one step from being dead. Are you through? You're grounded until further orders. Any questions? Yeah, one. Whatever became of "Killer" Hess? Maples. Yes, sir? I just wanted to tell you that... Well, try and forget it as soon as you can. Thank you, sir. I am sorry I lost control out there. I'm all right now. I am better now. I had a similar experience once. It's something I've never been able to completely shake. So I'm not exactly the one to give advice, but I thought-- Sir, it's the way of things, I guess. I figure it's all God's making and will. Doesn't the Book say that no sparrow shall fall to the earth unless He first gives His nod? Well, He must have given his nod to what happened out there today too. He must have. Well, He's the Almighty, isn't He? No, we have to trust Him, sir. How can we live without that? Go on, Maples. You see, Colonel, I've come to the conclusion that God and all His reasons are invisible to the eyes of man. So, I guess we have to be satisfied if He even gives us light enough to take our next step, do our next chore. Thank you, Maples. Thank you. - Is the Colonel here? - Uh-huh. - Cookie! - Yeah? The men and I have decided to have roast Long Island duck tonight with wild rice. You're gonna be lucky if you get warmed-over gruel! Those kids! Take a look at 'em! - Colonel? - Yes? - The mess sergeant here's got a problem. - Yes, Sergeant? Sir, them chow hounds are multiplying like rabbits! What am I gonna do with them? Feed them. Chong, what happened? Enemy agent, Colonel. I had to shoot her. She was just about ready to throw that into the ammunition dump. Chong had suspected her ever since the day you let her on the post with those kids. Oh, Chu. Don't cry. Don't cry, little baby. That's the full story on the woman, Colonel. North Korean guerilla. Sabotage. She picked up those poor, starving kids to make her look good. I've drawn an order making the base out of bounds to all civilians. Including the little civilians? Think there might be guerillas among them too? It's not that. But the way they're crowding in here now, they're becoming a nuisance. They're making the pilots nervous, afraid of hitting 'em on takeoffs and landings. All around, they could be dangerous. Yeah, dangerous for what they might become someday, if they live long enough. But you're right. It's no place for them. Don't post that until tomorrow. -Yes, sir. -Come on, Herman. We're going to Seoul. Want a lift? They mistrust anyone in uniform. They saw their family shot with the rest of their village. They'll have to be taught there's many different kinds of uniforms. Hop in. I'm Colonel Hess. This is Sergeant Herman. - Hi. - My name is Lu Wan. The children and I thank you, as do our poor, tired feet. - Where do you come from? - I come from Pusan. There I have a shop where I carve ivory statues of a religious nature. It is not a big shop, understand. Very small. Well, to be exact, it is not even a small shop; a stall in an alley. But I make the best statues in the whole city, and I am by conscience a modest man. Where are you heading? To a Buddhist temple not far from here where we hope to find shelter. I am a Christian, you understand, but a house of God is for anyone. If you'll drop us at the next crossroad. No, we'll take you there. Is this it? Yes, but the enemy has been there too. There are kids in here! Why, Miss Yang. Good evening, Colonel. I understand you found the equipment on the road. Yes, we did. Thank you. I can't tell you how much it helped. What are you doing here? Well, come in and see. Peaceful here. Oh, are they yours? No, I found them on the road. They have lost their parents. And you're taking care of them alone? Yes, we are about to leave. There is nothing here I hoped to find, and I could get no help in Yongsan. Well, where will you go? Just south, and hope for the best. Yeah. Oh, he will ride in the cart. Those roads are hardly passable. He can't-- Then I will carry him until he is well again. He won't get well traveling. But here he can only die. Miss Yang... I'd like your help. Yes. There are over a hundred children like this at the field. - A hundred children? - Yes. I have to get them away, and I just can't turn them loose. I'd like to bring them here. Here? So you could take care of them. Oh, but we have no food, no fuel, no medicine. There's no roof. We'll fix the roof. We'll furnish the supplies. I don't know what I can get exactly, but it'll be a lot better than you'll find along the road. - But a hundred children-- - We'll help with them too. How about it? Will you stay? - Oh, I don't think so. - Will you? - How could I refuse? - Good. I'll get on it right away. Lu Wan, this is Miss Yang. She'll stay and take care of the children. How about you? Will you stay and help out? I am sorry. I must get to Pusan. My statues. Now there is more need for them than ever. There's a bigger need here. You're a Christian, you said. Remember Matthew? "Whoso shall receive one such little child in My name, receiveth Me." I will stay, for a while. Thank you. Herman, you'll give them a hand, won't you? - Yes, sir. - Good. I'll have you picked up later. Come on, kids. - Colonel. - Yes, Lu Wan. First impressions are nets to catch the wind, but I have a persistent one about you, that you might be a man of God. Just another pilot. That's all. - Say, Colonel. - Yeah? I'm free for a while. I'd like to go along. -Maybe I can help them get settled down. -All right. Oh, tell Miss Yang that I'll be over there - as soon as I can. - Right. It'll be a relief to have them outta here. I almost hit a bunch of 'em yesterday on a takeoff. Scared me silly. - Any more than usual? - Okay, let's take off! Cheer up. There goes your problem. Well, at least they ate what I gave 'em without kickin'. Herman. Say, uh, take the jeep and go into town and see if you can find something for the kids, huh? Maybe some candy or something. Candy? Oh, I don't know, Colonel. This ain't much of a country for candy stores. Maybe the Good Lord will provide. Well, I don't know much about the Lord, but I got a hunch he ain't runnin' no candy stores in Yongsan. Well, then try Seoul. Okay, there's your eight boxes of candy. You better give me a couple of cartons of that gum too. Give me a couple of cartons of that gum. Now what admiral did you say that was for? Herman. Admiral Herman. Admiral Herman. Herman? -Want a lift, soldier? -No, thanks, Mac. I just had one. You know, Lieutenant, if the Navy ever got a gander at what we're doing with this tarpaulin-- They'd be happy to let you have it, Sergeant. Yeah, in the neck! Twenty years! If we keep this up, we're gonna have the mortgage paid off on this place. Second or third? Oh, Sergeant, this is beyond belief. - But what is this? - Chewing gum. - Want a pack, Lu? - Thank you, no. It's the best we could do on short notice, but don't worry. When the colonel and me get on the ball, it rolls! But where did you get such wonderful things from? Uh, the less said, the better, Miss Yang. Your army has been very generous. Oh, no, no, no, no, no! You ain't supposed to swallow it! - Just chew it. - Chu! Me Chu! Yeah, I know, I know, but that ain't the point. Now, here. You watch me. Put this in your mouth. Now just chew. See? Don't swallow it. It'll last forever. Just chew it. Now you got it! Food, soap, even beds. You have no idea what luxury you have provided for us. Well, let's keep that kind of quiet. If the quartermasters ever find out that an army cot's a luxury, I hate to think what they'll have us sleepin' on! Oh, no! He swallowed it again. Chu! - Chu! Hi there, old-timer! - Major. Hey, this is a cheerful place, Dean. Thank goodness, you came! He's done nothing but ask for you. Looks like we're in business, Miss Yang. This is Major Moore. I told Herman the Lord would provide. But you didn't say He might work through the U.S. Navy. It's not bad for a start. Now, with a little more money-- even five dollars-- we could do better. Pardon me. - Yang. - Thank you, Lieutenant, Major. Now I must bathe Chu. He always manages to be the last in the tub. Come, Chu. Come, Chu. Wait a minute. Okay, sport. We'll see it through together. - Nice job, isn't it, Major? - Many of the children are Christians, so I thought they should have their symbol too. With my own tools it would have been better, I assure you. Understand, it is not a poor job. Someday I will carve you one of ivory. -It will be beautiful. -Someday we'll hold you to that, Lu Wan. The address of my shop in Pusan. Thank you. I wish the war would stop just long enough to let these children get to a safe place. I know only one: Cheju. It's where my home is. Cheju? Where is that? Oh, well, it may as well be on the moon. It's an island 60 miles off the coast. - Have you always lived there? - Since I was a child. My father was Korean, and my mother from India. They met in Delhi, and I was born there, but Cheju has been my home for almost all of my life. No bombings there, are there? None. There would be food and help. The school I taught in is empty now. That would make a fine shelter for the children. Yeah. Sounds like a perfect haven, doesn't it? But 60 miles-- - What did he say? - Oh, he asked if you were his father. - Now what did he say? - That I was his-- It's time for supper, Colonel. Would you care to join us? Yes! I'd love to. Ah, ah, ah! Thompson. - Come on. - Major. - How 'bout mine? - Nothin' yet. It can't be all my gals have forgotten me. Some wise guy. "Reverend Dean Hess." Look, never mind the jokes. Just hurry up-- Hey, wait a minute. Let me see that. "Reverend Dean Hess." Well, I'll be a-- We've managed to pick up a few old trucks and tanks. Starting tomorrow, you'll be able to give your students target practice. That should come in real handy, Colonel. Mail's in, Reverend. For you. Seems somebody's trying to rib you. It's from the deacon of my congregation back home. You mean you were a preacher? And at Thanksgiving you just let me fumble around? You did just fine, Frank. People who volunteer usually do. I don't get it, Dean. I thought I knew you pretty well. You know, we were in a lot of rough stuff together. You weren't exactly the preacher type over in Germany. - That was a long time ago. - Not so long! What happened to you? Too many free pamphlets on the street corner? "Heaven's your destination. Repent and be saved." Don't tell me you got caught up in that stuff. I don't see how this concerns you. Well, it does! Why didn't you tell us you were a preacher? Oh, brother! A parson for a C.O. Well, let me tell you, the men won't like it. - They'll like whoever gets the job done! - Yeah. What are you gonna do if you have to gun down a Yak? This is a training unit. Today it's a training unit, sure. -But that doesn't mean it will be tomorrow! -That's all, Captain Skidmore. You're excused. Well? What'd he say? It's true, all right. Ain't that the livin' end? Somebody buy me a drink, quick. "And while Mary wants to keep it from you at present, I believe you should know that she is going to have a baby. The doctor says that you are not to worry and she's fine." I'm going to headquarters to make a phone call. I'm gonna get some cigars! I'm gonna have a baby! At headquarters? Yes? Oh, Colonel Hess. -Hello, Major. Is the General in? -He's in Tokyo. Anything I can do for you? Yes, I'd like to use your phone to call Westhampton, Ohio. - I'm gonna have a baby! - You're what? - My wife is. - Oh, congratulations. Thank you. There must be some way to get through to her. Well, it's not going to be quite as easy as all that, - but we'll see what we can do. - Good. Hello? Hello? Dean? Dean, I was petrified when the operator said, "Korea calling." - Anything the matter? - No, no, everything's fine. I just heard from Deacon Edwards about you. Oh, darling, I'm walking on air. I say, "I'm walking on air." Are you all right? Nothing to worry about, Dr. Corrigan says. - Everything is gonna be fine. - It will be a boy, won't it? If that's what you want, of course. Anything you say, Colonel. Hello? Dean? Mary? Hello? - Hello? Hello? - Dean? Come on now. Let's go. That's it. How are you, Lu Wan? -Fine, thank you, Colonel. -Picked these children up on the road. Did you get through to your wife, Colonel? - Yes, everything's fine. - New guests? - Hungry too. - I'll take care of 'em. I'll get these other chow hounds into the sack and drive you back to the base. -Good. -Say, you honest to gosh gonna have a kid? - Honest to gosh. - Yeah? Oh, here. I almost forgot. Oh, thanks, Colonel. Come on, team. Charge. What have we here, Lu Wan? A piece of army soap has many uses. Let's hope you whittle with it more successfully than we wash with it. Chu! - Chu! - He heard your jeep driving up. He's always waiting for you, Colonel. You have such a way with these little ones. I better have. I'm gonna have one of my own soon. Well, don't you look handsome! Your own? I just found out today. I even telephoned my wife. Your wife? Your wife must be very happy. As happy as she can be with a husband who's left her alone. She is not alone. She will have her baby and the knowledge that you will come home to her someday. Come, Chu. It's your bedtime. Almost finished. Why, it's Miss Yang. Though to do it in soap is an insult. She deserves the finest ivory. - A beautiful and remarkable young lady. - Yes. But there's something... I don't know... strange about her. Like so many of us, she's lost everything-- thrown into the middle of war, deprived of home, family, friends and romance. Listen to this old soap carver speak of romance! Why, romance is so far in my past, I can't even turn it into a good memory! - Lu Wan. - Yes? The children would like to say goodnight to you. Ah, I will see them. It is always a pleasure to talk with you, Colonel. What a lovely evening. You'd hardly think there was a war going on around here, would you? Just smell the pine. The pine, Colonel, is our symbol for eternity. Because it is green all the year round, it seems to live forever. On Cheju, near the schoolhouse, there are twin pine trees. They mirror each other. When the wind blows, they sway together like two dancers. When it is still, they stand patiently, their branches entwined. The legend is that they grow together, side by side. Out of the graves of two lovers? Of two lovers who could not have each other in this life. Miss Yang! It's okay. They're all tucked in and half asleep. Thank you, Herman. Miss Yang... Well, uh good night. Good night, Colonel. Poor boy. You're really loaded. Let's see. How did I do? Yeah, that's pretty good. Up you go. Who's next? You want to be next? Let's see what we got here. I think they're down in the back this time. This might tickle a little bit, but... Keep your eyes closed. I think I'll recommend you for an insect gun sharpshooting medal. I must have killed a million of these bugs single-handed. A delousing detail like this gives me a sense of power! Get these kids outta here! Scramble! Hit the deck! Hollis! Break! Bandit comin' in on your tail, Colonel! - Macintosh Leader. - Go ahead, Maples. There's one on my tail. Can you get him? Break right, Maples. I'll get on him. He's closing in! What are you gonna do if you have to gun down a Yak? Cut him off, Colonel! Help me! Thanks, Colonel! That was crazy shooting! Boy, it looked like you guys were having one big time up there! Where are you going, Lu Wan? You're not leaving? I have been here too long. I must get to Pusan. I have responsibilities. Well, we'd like you to stay. You know that. It wouldn't be fair to ask any more of you. Thank you for what you've done. What? Jostle some children on my knee so I can enjoy their laughter? It is I who should thank you. But, Colonel, you seem troubled. There's nothing so terrible as war. I killed today. Yes, war is evil. I see what is in your heart. Colonel, may a poor old carver of ivory babble for a moment? Understand, it is only babble and may have no more worth than a handful of sand. In times like these, can a man of good conscience ask others, "Protect me. Kill for me. But do not ask me to stain my hands"? What must one do when a choice between two evils is all that is offered? To accept the lesser sometimes can be our only choice. In order to save, at times we must destroy, and in destruction, create new life. Is that the answer? The true answer, Colonel, is not in my babble. It is in the Book. "O Lord, thou hast seen my wrong; judge thou my cause." Who are you? Just a weary old man, most anxious to get to his stall in Pusan. The dance is a great favorite. It tells of two girls who are friends meeting after a great adversity and relating their discoveries about life. One goes on and on relating a hundred things about this and that. And the other? She relates but one: That faith is the greatest comforter of all. This is Macintosh Control. How many tanks did you say? Repeat. Better alert the colonel. Do you read me, Vagabond One? Colonel! - Colonel Hess. - What is it? We just picked up a radio report from a forward observer. Big enemy armored column movin' in. Macintosh Control. Repeat your position. Repeat your position. Over. Macintosh Control. This is Vagabond One. I'm at Abel-Mike-7523. Enemy column moving directly south. Nothing to stop them this side of Division Headquarters. Need air strike immediately. -What a night for this! -Sure, they're using the weather to push ahead. Alert the men, Herman. - Call Headquarters. - I'll get dressed. Calling Butterfly. Calling Butterfly. This is Macintosh Control. Over. They're only 45 minutes to the north. All the other airstrips are socked in even worse than we are. Not a plane in the whole area can get off the ground. That goes for us too. That runway, Colonel It'd take pontoons easier than wheels. Sir, my men and I volunteer to try it. No, I don't think so. That runway's too tough. I don't even know if it's usable. - Moore... - Why don't we find out? Get a plane ready for me, bombs and rockets. Yes, sir. - Permission to go along. - No. You need someone for top cover. I'm not risking any more planes than I have to. If anything happens to you, we're sitting ducks back here. If two of us go, one is bound to get through. Besides, I've got some makin' up to do, Dean. - Go get your gear. - Thanks. Tell that observer we're on our way. Ready the other planes. Korean pilots on alert. Wilco. If things look bad, I'll let you know. Get word to Miss Yang to be ready to evacuate the children. You better stay close to the deck. Those clouds look like they got rocks in 'em. Good luck. Permission to go first. No. And if I don't make it, don't you try. That's an order. Roger. He's crazy. They'll never make it. Come on, boys! Come on, men! Come on! Get up there. Get up there! That's it! You can make it! Go on! I'm airborne. Come on ahead. Right behind you. Nothing to it. I sure am glad we're coming out of the soup. We should be in the target area by now. I'll try and contact that British observer. Hello, Vagabond. Hello, Vagabond. This is Macintosh Blue Leader. Come in. Over. Hello, Macintosh Blue Leader. This is Vagabond. - Is that all of you? - That's all. How does it look from there? For a while, the weather had them bogged down a bit, but now it's stopped raining. They've started to move again. If you could knock out those lead tanks, they'd block the road. Got you. Read him, Skidmore? - I got him. - We'll do as he says. Target straight ahead. Wowie. Nice going! Now if you hit their rear, it'll contain them until we get more help. Who needs it? Man, this is a turkey shoot. Macintosh Leader to Macintosh Control. Do you receive me? Over. This is Macintosh Control. Go ahead. - Major Chong's group ready? - Affirmative. Turn 'em loose. Roger. Green light. Can you have another go at the head of the column? They're moving around those lead tanks. Roger. We'll go after them. - Did you read him, Skidmore? - Roger. Okay. Let's make these last rockets count. Clobbered him on that one! Yanks, you've got 'em boxed up! Your crew can tie the ribbon on. Pink or blue? Reaching fuel limit. Let's head for the base. Right. Right with you, Dean. You all right, Skidmore? I'm afraid I've had it. Hang on! Don't know if I can. Yes, you can, Stan. Our ROK pilots at 12:00. Here's where our training starts paying off. Wilco. Here they come. Macintosh Leader to Tower. -Get the ambulance and crash wagons to stand by. -Yes, sir! Sighting the field, Stan. We're almost home, boy. Stay with me. Okay. Look, you're doing just great, Stan. Straighten up. Keep it straight now. That's it. Now, put your wheels down. Do you hear me? Put your wheels down. Thattaboy. Line it up, Stan. Keep it lined up. Nice and easy. That's a boy. You're doing just great. Keep it just like that. Fly right on in for a nice landing. I'll stay up till you've landed safely. Dean? Dean? - Yes, Stan? - Are you there? - Right here. - I'm... I'm scared. There's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing. I thought I knew how to live... but I didn't. Now I... I... don't know how to die. - Dean? - Yes, Stan? Say... Say a prayer for me. It's already been said. Look, don't be afraid. Think of life as a shadowy place crowded with people who can't see each other very well. Think also of a door just beyond. When that door opens, we pass through into a wonderful brightness. That's all there is. Just a gentle step from darkness to light. From darkness to light. Thank you... Reverend. If you say so. Thanks. And a wind came from the wilderness. And it carried me... where man can never reach alone. And for the first time, in trying to bring him a measure of peace, I felt that I may have been the instrument that I had wanted and needed to be. Perhaps, through the agony of war, I have finally done what I never before was able to do. In reaching beyond myself, I have found myself. Chu. Sleep well. We didn't expect you so late, Colonel. The children are all sleeping. May we step outside for a moment? Of course. Miss Yang, I... - I'm being moved to another airfield. - Moved? Now don't worry. Herman and Lieutenant Maples are staying. Everything will be just the same. One thing is not the other, Colonel. The mulberry bush will not give the same shade as the pine. You will be here. Who knows for how long? Oh, forgive me. It is not like me to admit to my fears. But lately, Cheju has been much in my mind. Something... Some fear tells me I will never see my home again. When this is all over, you'll see Cheju again. Goodbye, Miss Yang. Goodbye, Colonel. Until a better day. Until a better day. Orders arrive for me yet? Hess. Dean Hess. Oh, yes, Colonel. Came in about an hour ago. From the looks of things, you didn't get out of that. - Yongsan area any too soon. - Why? What's up? Enemy's mounting an all-out attack. Your ROK outfit's already abandoned the field and been pulled back for regrouping. The whole area's been written off. Well, I'll get your orders now, Colonel. No, no, no, not chew gum! Come on! Get it inside! - Heads up! - Too bad we're fresh out of gum. -You're not kidding. -Hey, whatever happened to that last carton anyway? - Ask Chu. - Hey, it's the colonel! - Well, what in the world? - My jeep took one. -Is it true about the field? -Yes, sir. Closed yesterday. We stopped by with these supplies on our way to the Replacement Pool. - Miss Yang! - Oh, Colonel! You knew we needed you! You've got to move out of here! But with all these children... - There are almost 400! - Well, you can't stay, that's all. Now come on! We haven't any time to waste. Herman, put those supplies back in the jeep! Yes, sir. All right. Put it in there. Anywhere in here, Maples. How's the boy? I don't think he can go much further, Colonel. They're all so exhausted. There's an airstrip eight or 10 more miles down this road. From there, we might be able to get the children to Cheju. Cheju? But how? Just a few transport planes could fly them across. First thing in the morning, I'll go on ahead and find out. You start down the road, and I'll meet you on my way back. Colonel. - Colonel. - Why, Lu Wan! Some refugees on the road informed me that you had to leave the temple. So I turned back to offer my assistance. Well, we sure can use it. But I thought you wanted to get to Pusan. I am not sure I want to go there anymore. I was told my store was destroyed by fire. So, I thought that being of service to those little ones is something that can never be destroyed. We're hoping to get them to Cheju, but it seems almost impossible. The difference between the impossible and the possible is the measure of man's will. Lu Wan! Come and sit down. You look tired. Mine is age, Miss Yang. It is you who must be tired. Let me take the child, and you sleep. - Oh, no, no. I-- - You must sleep. * Swing low * Sweet chariot * Coming for to carry me home * * Swing low * Sweet chariot * Coming for to carry * Me home Come on, will ya, Joe? We gotta burn this place down to the ground! Hey, Frank, over here! Help me load this! All right, all right, I'm coming! Sergeant, I... I'm Colonel Hess. Are you the duty officer? I was, sir. The squadron was diverted this morning. Last plane just left. You mean there's no more planes coming in? The field's been written off. We're the last ones. I gotta find some sort of transportation to take some kids to an island: Cheju. -Kids? -Yeah. Three or four hundred of 'em. - Can you help me out? - Four hundred? That's impossible, Colonel! Have you tried the port? -No. How far is it? -Eighteen miles, straight down the runway. Thanks, Captain. Yes, sir. Captain Reardon. Everyone's gone but us. - Have you started your fire yet? - Yes, sir. Oh, Major, a colonel was just here and wanted an airlift for a bunch of kids to Cheju. Children, hundreds. - What's his name? - Hess, I think. So that's where he is. Tell him his orders are in. - Then get out of there! - Yes, sir! Colonel! Colonel! I wish we had a line to the port. That colonel's in trouble! Want me to, uh, hook it up again? No, go ahead. - To Cheju? - Yes, sir. Several hundred of 'em, the captain said. Sev... - Put me through to him. - Right, sir. Lieutenant, can you fix me up with an evacuation boat of some kind? - An L.S.T. Maybe? - An L.S.T.? There's nothing free in the whole coast. But these are orphans! Dying ones! I'm sorry, Colonel, but we're in a bind for anything that'll carry troops. You're the Navy! Where's all your ships? You're the Air Force. Where's all your planes? Come on! No luck. No luck? Ours? -No! Theirs! -Off the road, everybody! Down in the ditch! Herman, get those kids off that cart! Yung-Ai! Yung-Ai! Okay, back on the road. He's gone. He's gone. You... You will see them to safety. I know. I... I was not to see Cheju again. But you... you will. I... I couldn't find anything to say, not even a prayer. Words do not carry the greatest tribute, my son. No more than they may hold the perfect truth. Good deeds are your purest prayers. Planes! - Ours! - 119s! Troop Carrier Command! - Five of 'em! - Five! - Maybe they're not for us. - Find out. - Colonel Hess here? - He sure is! Who sent you people? General Cambridge. Just call us "Operation Kiddy-Car." But our name will be mud unless we get out of here now! Yes, sir! Hey, Colonel! Wow! What a thing to be buddies with a general! Come on! This way! Come on, children! Come on this way. Come on through. Come on. That's my boy! Aha! Where ya been? - The lead pilot wants the word, sir. - Tell him to take off. - Yes, sir. - Green light. Take off. Not bad. Chu! - This is old Chu. - Chu! Me Chu! - Me Mary, Chu. - You Mary. - Yes. - Here you are, sport. Oh, it's wonderful to see them so healthy. We fed 'em gum. Darling, you look as happy as the children. It's always been the children. * Mine eyes have seen the glory * * Of the coming of the Lord * He is trampling out the vintage * * Where the grapes of wrath are stored * * He loosed the fateful lightning * * Of His terrible swift sword * His truth is marching on * Glory, glory Hallelujah * * Glory, glory Hallelujah * * Glory, glory Hallelujah * * His truth is * Marching on
