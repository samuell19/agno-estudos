[Man singing] With one kiss To my cold winter heart And I know that summer isn't very far It warms with this love of mine Like summertime Didn't see a cloud in your eyes of blue And I found myself falling in love with you A love I'd always dreamed I'd find In summertime Then one day I knew Our love was really over Ending like the fading colors Setting with the sun [Telephone ringing] MAN ON TELEPHONE: Anne? Annie. Annie, are you there? Annie, what's going on over there? Annie, speak to me. Annie, you're scaring me. What's going on? Annie. WOMAN: The trial of Dr. Timothy Ryder, accused of murdering his wife Anne, resumes this afternoon. Defense attorneys are expected to attack the credibility... of star prosecution witness Professor Charles Lattimore. Lattimore's discovery of stolen hospital files... has been a key element to the state's case. ATTORNEY: You were in Tim Ryder's house... when you first saw this photograph. What was the occasion of your visit? When Dr. Ryder was first arrested for his wife's murder, I decided to write a book about the case. Sort of like the lawyer who chases the proverbial ambulance. Once you decided to write your book, you contacted the defendant. How did he respond to your request for an interview? CHARLES: He was very cooperative. And after the first contact was made? Dr. Ryder and I spent a lot of time together... over the next several months. ATTORNEY: Dr. Ryder opened his entire life to you. Isn't that correct? Yes. Tell me something. After all the time you spent with Dr. Ryder, did you consider him a friend? I still do. WOMAN: A verdict was reached today... in a case that made national headlines. Dr. Timothy Ryder was found guilty of second-degree murder. How could he do this? Please, come with me, sir. MAN: Ryder. WOMAN: Can you give us a comment? WOMAN: Professor Lattimore, the man you call a friend... is going to prison because of your testimony. How do you feel about that? [String quartet playing] I figured you could use a drink. Cheers. Mike, you still haven't told me what you thought of the book. Good. Great. Very interesting. Real page-turner. Of course, you got a couple of things wrong. -Like? -Like--all right, right here. "Lieutenant Mike Dowling, “the detective assigned to the case, "was well-known in the small college town." OK. "His predilection... "for expensively tailored Italian suits... "had earned him an affectionate nickname--Dapper Dowling"? Thank you. Well, at least I used the word affectionate. Can I help it if I'm the only one around with style? Lattimore, welcome back from sabbatical. Henry. Henry, how wonderful to see you. I read your new book. It's, um...fun. Of course, I liked your little whodunits a lot better. You know what they say. We can't all be Shakespeare. Give it to me. I'll sign it. Thank you. What the hell-- the money's good, right? Paperback rights, miniseries down the line. So I hear congratulations are in order. Well, that's very generous of you. I think he's talking about your promotion, Henry. Oh. That. Yeah. Youngest man ever to head up the English department, right? Mm-hmm. Cute. A lot of things have changed since you left, Charles. Once you get settled, we should sit down and talk. Good seeing you, Henry. What was that all about? Guess you haven't seen Laura since you've been back. Uh-uh. I did send her an invitation. I thought it might be better... to get reacquainted in public. That's not a bad idea, since last time... she came at you with a waffle iron. She had her reasons, didn't she? Mm-hmm. Have you heard from her? Yeah. Ellen and I had her over a few months ago. Alone? Excuse me, Professor Lattimore, would you sign my book? Yes, certainly. To? Francesca Lavin. I'm taking your creative writing class this term-- The Art of the Thriller. Oh, God. Not that crud again. You don't think much of crime writers. They just don't realize that most people get murdered... in their own living room and usually by someone they know. No grand schemes, no premeditation-- CHARLES: I'm happy to leave real-life murder up to you. Give me the fictional kind any day. Miss Lavin, I'll see you in class. Nice guy. Married, though. Actually, Mrs. Lattimore has petitioned for divorce. Oh. You do your homework. Just enough to know the professor's strengths. And his weakness. Bye-bye, Lieutenant. Good luck. Professor Lattimore. Glad you could make it. Just think, you've only been back a few hours. -What is that? -What? That hard line running from your lower lip. Keeping your teeth clenched for a year will do that. Don't flatter yourself, Charlie. I wrote letters. I called you. I even sent you a telegram. You never, ever responded. I kept in touch. Through a divorce attorney? That's hardly what I call keeping an open mind. This isn't the place to get into this. OK. OK. Let's have dinner. Why? So you can tell me it was all a terrible mistake? The girl meant nothing to you? The stress made you do it? Something like that. Charlie, you forget something. 1 teach this for a living. I know these stories inside out. [LOUDLY] Would it make any difference if I told you... that there hasn't been anyone else? What do you want from me, Charlie? I don't know. Here. Let me sign your book. When I agreed to the separation, I thought, "Maybe she's right. "Maybe the whole thing has gone sour.” But then I realized I didn't feel like that at all. Here. Read it. Charlie, this is difficult to say, but I'm seeing someone. That's understandable. I didn't expect you to twiddle your thumbs for a year. Well, actually, it's pretty serious. Serious? I think so. OK. Well, do I know him? What's his name? Hey, where have you been? Did you just get here? LAURA: A few minutes ago. I--I don't believe this. Well, as I told you, Charles, a lot has changed around here. I wanted to tell you before. I guess you were otherwise engaged. This was a terrible mistake. Let's go. -Thanks for the book, Charlie. -OK. -Thanks for the book. -Mm-hmm. -Hey, it could be worse. -How? I don't know. I'll think about it. I mean, what does she see in this guy? Well, I hear he keeps his hands off his students. Before I begin teaching a course, I like to get to know something about my students. I usually do this by asking a few questions-- Kind of an informal survey. You can answer by raising your hand. OK, first question: how many of you have ever committed murder? Don't be shy. Just raise your hand if you've ever killed somebody. Hmm. I guess you guys don't get out much. OK, next question. How many of you have ever THOUGHT about killing someone? -You are? -Jon Steinmetz. Tell me, Jon, haven't you ever fantasized... about murdering someone? Hmm? Your older sister or that piano teacher you had in third grade? Oh, come on, Jon. How about the guy who sold you that beret? There have been a few professors I would have liked to kill. STUDENTS: Ooh. This is good. I put Jon on the spot. Now he wants to put me six feet under. Good. Take a look at this. These are some typical weapons used... in the mystery and detective novel: the pearl-handled revolver... a vial of poison... a French garrote-- Each one ideal for committing the most dastardly of crimes. Here's a quote. "A thriller is a piece of writing... "whose plot development depends on violence."” But here's another quote. "A writer is at his most capable and confident... "when he deals with things which are familiar to him." This leaves us with a little problem, as no one in this room has ever committed a murder. Most of you say you've never even considered it. Ow! But yet you all want to write thrillers, which depend, for their effectiveness, on acts of extreme violence. Short of becoming actual murderers, where does this leave us? Professor Lattimore, your hand! STUDENTS: Aah! Charlie Lattimore's rule number one: a mystery writer must be like a magician-- Always keep the reader thinking about the inconsequential... while taking his mind off the bigger picture. I have to return these to the drama department. Anyway, as this course goes on, we'll learn all the tricks of the trade... so that by the end of this semester, you'll each be able to construct a fairly decent thriller. But to give you another quote, "Plots, MacGuffins, and such are like carpentry-- "Making a wood cabinet into a work of art... is something the carpenter cannot be taught.” As writers, you have to get... inside the head of each of your characters. In a mystery story, that means not just understanding... the victim of the crime, but also the killer. The first assignment of this semester, due in three weeks, is simply this: plan a perfect murder. I want to see, in 10 pages or less, a whodunnit in which you are the villain. In order to throw off the police, you should have an airtight alibi and alternate suspect... who can take the blame for your actions. Of course, the poet W.H. Auden claimed... there was no such thing as the perfect murder. He said guilt, man's need to atone... was the traitor within the gates that would always give him away. But who know? Maybe the guy was wrong. Yes? What about all the homicides that go unsolved each year? Wouldn't Auden consider them perfect murders? No, just sloppy detective work. Auden's point was that no matter how small, there was always a calling card left behind. Just took a good pair of eyes to find it. Like yours? Excuse me? Weren't you the only one... who could see Dr. Ryder's calling card? [Bell rings] Well, I just got lucky. Thank you. I'll see you all next Wednesday. Uh, Professor Lattimore. R-Robert Miner. I'm a big fan of your work. You're the main reason I transferred here to Hampstead. I hope you enjoy the class. ROBERT: Murder is sort of a hobby of mine. Oh. CHARLIE: What is all this, anyway? It's, um--it's research. When I found that you were writing about the Ryder case, I became obsessed with it. It's one of the most interesting murders of the past 10 years. Don't you agree? That's not exactly the way I'd put it. ROBERT: Can I ask you a few questions about it? CHARLIE: After three years, I'm burned out on it. It's related to the course. The Ryder case proves Auden was wrong. There is such a thing as a perfect murder. Uh, I'm not following you. The person who killed Mrs. Ryder pulled off the perfect crime. You don't think her husband did it. -Couldn't have. -Why not? The murderer duplicated the M.O. of a cult killer. Only the police knew... about the pentagrams carved in the victim's hands. Ryder was chief surgeon at the hospital... where the murder victims died. If you read my book, you'd know those autopsy reports... were stolen from hospital files, proving--PROVING that Ryder knew about the pentagram. -If he took the files. -I found them at his home. Maybe somebody planted them there. I think you're moving into the world of fiction now. You see, what I want to know is, could this be my perfect murder paper? You mean prove in three weeks that my book is totally invalid? I have nothing but respect for your work. I just don't think this case against Ryder adds up. And if you could confirm your suspicions, you know I'd feel compelled to do something about it. Not a bad way to kick-start a writing career. Those thoughts have crossed my mind, but there's another reason-- Something I read between the lines of your book. What's that? In spite of all the evidence, you're still not convinced Ryder did it. Am I right? Do the assignment your way, Mr. Miner. Just make sure you surprise me, that's all. Oh, I will... Professor. "Paradise by the Deathboard Light, "by Linda Jo James. "Tubular bondage in the backseat, "55 miles per hour in an unmoving car. "Innocence lost on beer-stained vinyl. "Green light gives way to yellow. Caution. "Watch out! You've run my red light!"” “Agony." "Misery." "Bliss." "Awakening." "My very own love canal.” "Bad Joni Mitchell on AM. "92.5. "Was it good for you? "Was I even there? "Help me, I think I'm falling in love with you." Thank you. Well, that was refreshing. Thank you, Linda Jo. It's getting pretty late, so if no one else wants to recite-- CHARLIE: Wild nights-- Wild nights. Wild nights! Were I with thee, wild nights should be... our luxury. Futile the winds to a heart in port. Done with the compass. Done with the chart! Rowing in Eden-- Ah, the sea. Might I but moor tonight in thee. [Applause] My heartfelt thanks... to Emily Dickinson. Thank you, class. That's all for now. So, how about it, then? I already have a date, Charlie. Come on. You don't love Potter. -Really? How do you know? -I know. You're wrong. Henry is-- What? Overly ambitious? A little plastic? Lacking a soul? Completely trustworthy. Aren't you ever going to forgive me? -Do you know why I left you? -Yes. If you think it's a girl, you're wrong. What was it, then? You changed. Writing that book did something to you. What, exactly? I mean, am I supposed to guess? Why don't you try thinking about it? I will, I promise, but unless you talk to me, how will I know when I've figured it out? Oh, Charlie. All right, you win. If you'd like, we can grab a bite to eat sometime. There. Does that make you happy? Ecstatic. Good. -Well, good night. -OK. Good night. -Sweet dreams. -Mmm. HENRY: Got a minute, Lattimore? CHARLIE: What's up? It's about this assignment of yours. Aren't you pushing it a little bit? I can just see next year's catalog: "Come to Hampstead. "Get your first, second, and third degree in Murder." Is that what's really bothering you? Laura told me you two spoke last night. We were married for over 10 years, Henry. I won't give her up without a fight. Do what you have to, Lattimore. -You should know one thing. -What's that? I never lose. That's funny. I thought you were going to say something human... like how much you love Laura. I'm going to make your life very difficult, Charles. Here. That might interest you. Good characters are haunted by the past, just as real people are. They have personal problems unrelated to the plot, just as real people do. Broken love affairs, bankruptcies, shameful deeds they want to forget. The most powerful plots are based... on characters in conflict with themselves. Usually it's the internal conflict, the tug of war that goes on inside a character, that makes a story more compelling. Forget-me-nots, your favorites. Believe me, Charlie, I've long since forgotten. What about lunch, hmm? We've had lunch twice this week. Don't you have work to do? I got all your favorites. I have to grade these papers before tomorrow. And besides, I brought my own lunch. Ah. It's a shame about all those papers, isn't it? What are you eating these days for lunch? Um. Smells delicious. Yummy, yummy. [Laura laughs] LAURA: You're too much. I thought you were too busy for lunch. There's more than enough for three. Would you care to join us? Hmm? CHARLIE: When plotting a suspense story, it's a good idea to start with a double strand-- The crime filament and the man/woman relationship. The possibility of romance always gives a story... an added element of suspense. Sex and love provide the most common motive for murder. OK. CHARLIE: You want to constantly place a series of questions... in your reader's mind. "What will so-and-so do next?" the reader should ask. One of the worst mistakes you can make as a mystery writer... is to leave all your revelations for the last page. When the reader finally learns who the villain is, you should have left enough clues... for him to say, "Sure. Why didn't I think of that?" [Thunder] But you can't make your mystery too transparent. CHARLIE: It's impossible to overstate the importance... of research to a writer. Murder becomes much more believable... when it's rooted in a sense of reality. My old friend Tilden has agreed to let us watch an autopsy. STUDENT: H-how did he die? It looks like a suicide. He jumped out the bedroom window of his apartment. What is that? -That's glass. -From the window? No, this glass is from bifocals. They found a pair near the body. Which means it probably wasn't suicide. Yeah? Most suicides take off their glasses before they jump. You really don't want 20/20 vision at a time like that. That's right, which is an indication... that we have to look a little closer. Very good, Robert. Brr! -Professor Lattimore. -Yes. I forgot this. Your wife asked me to give it to you. -Charlie. -Mike, where were you? Sorry. There was a holdup at a convenience store. Don't worry about it. Tilden's autopsy was enough for one day. MIKE: But I had my speech all planned. "The first thing to do is forget everything Lattimore told you. "It's a bunch of bull." ROBERT: Lieutenant Dowling? -Yeah. Mike, this is Robert Miner, the student I told you about. Oh, right. The one that thinks Ryder's innocent. So how's your investigation going? ROBERT: Did you know Mrs. Ryder planned to leave her husband? MIKE: She was cheating on him. That's why he killed her. She took a lease on an apartment in town. I spoke to the apartment manager. I saw the lease. I don't remember reading that in your report. This kid's on the ball. It just makes Ryder's motive even stronger. She wants to leave. He tries to stop her. If he did it. Ha ha ha! OK. How do you explain the autopsy files... being in the Ryder house? ROBERT: I think somebody planted them. MIKE: You were doing OK until then. That's far too speculative. ROBERT: Ryder's prints weren't on those files. Gloves. The only prints the police found belonged to Professor Lattimore. Looks like I arrested the wrong guy. I have to get back to the office. Can you give me a lift? That depends. Can I handcuff you to the cage? I didn't mean to accuse-- He was teasing. Stop it. Come on. Let's go. -Good meeting you. Good luck. -Thanks. MIKE: Hey! [Bell tower bell ringing] HENRY: Damn it. Why did she do this? [Telephone rings] HENRY: Oh, it's you. Yes, I got your note. Look, I will not let you do this to me. Yeah. All right. All right! [Knocks on door] Laura? Is that you? LAURA: Uh-huh. CHARLIE: Robert gave me your note. LAURA: I'll be right out. Can you believe it? The place hasn't changed in 15 years. LAURA: Why don't you make yourself comfortable? Do you remember the first time we came here? You were so nervous... because you thought your father followed us. When we got here, you hid in the bathroom for an hour. You remember that? Everything OK in there? LAURA: Everything's just fine. Comfortable? This was worth waiting for. You don't know how much I missed this. You know that? What do you think you're doing? [Click] When you gave the assignment, I thought, "What better victim than Professor Lattimore?" Definitely a character haunted by his past. To be specific, a sordid affair with a student... that broke up an otherwise happy marriage. How did you get this information? There aren't many secrets in a college town. What about giving the police an alternate suspect? Otherwise, they might actually do some detective work. I've taken care of that. You'll read all about it in my paper. Oh, but I forgot. You won't be around by then. So, how about it, Professor? Do I shoot you here in cold blood... and commit the perfect murder... or do I spare your life and get an "A"? [Charlie chuckles] An "A"? Remedial studies is more like it. Before you shoot, look at that envelope over there. "To be opened in the event of my death or disappearance.” I know it's a cliché, but read on. "This is to notify the authorities... “that I may have endangered my life... "by agreeing to meet Francesca Lavin... "at the Dockett Cove Motel." So on and so forth. The original is in a place where it can easily be discovered... by the police. You broke the first rule of the mystery writer: never let your reader get ahead of you. When Robert gave me the note, I suspected it was a fake. How? The phrase "PLEASE don't tell anyone” is completely out of character for Laura. If she'd really decided to meet me here, she would have told Potter first. How did you get Robert to deliver the note? Oh, you know guys like that. Al did was bat my eyes at him a few times. The gun? I waited in the department office until the janitor left. I lied about the bullets, though. The gun was empty. 1 lied, too. There was no copy. If you knew all along it was me, why did you come here? I never walk away from a challenge. I was just reminded of something you said in class. What was that? The possibility of romance always gives the story... an added element of suspense. CHARLIE: Oh, no, no, no. No. 'm sorry. 'm sorry. I know. A character in conflict with himself. I guess you could call it that. CHARLIE: I've got to get back. By the way, there were a few other calling cards... you left lying around. -Like what? -Fingerprints, for one. You touched the bathroom door and the light switch. FRANCESCA: I could have wiped them off. Yes, assuming you remembered everything you touched. Even someone with the most casual interest in crime... would tell you that you would have been a lot safer... wearing gloves. And what about the body? I guess you'd have left it here. Why not? No one knew I was here. CHARLIE: You fail to realize that a murder and an affair... bring about an entirely different set of circumstances. There's a lot the authorities might overlook. But a warm body gives the police a head start. Francesca: Uh! When it comes to murder, any detail comes under scrutiny. Oh, Francesca! Francesca, come on. Come on. WOMAN: Sheriff's department. Yes, um, hello. Is, um, Mike Dowling there, please? WOMAN: I'll check. I'm sorry. He's off-duty tonight. Can anyone else help you? Hello? Is there anyone else you want to speak with? No, no. No, thank you. [Dial tone] Oh, hi. Charlie, you're the last person I expected to see. Since when do you get up before 9:00? Oh, I'm just, uh, just getting a jump on the day. What are you up to? Nothing. I could always tell when you were hiding something. It looks like one of your students... got a head start on the perfect murder assignment. What do you mean? There was a paper put in my mailbox by mistake. What did it say? Some scheme about a young woman tricking an older man... into a romantic rendezvous. Sound familiar? It's got a great twist in it, though. The man is not the real target. The girl is. Someone else kills her, leaving the innocent man to deal with the body. Isn't that clever? It's, uh--it's preposterous. I kind of like the ending. "Finally, the sad, frustrated man... "has been inexorably drawn into the crime... "by virtue of his broken heart.” I'll read it, OK? Thanks. We found this in the bathroom, Lieutenant. -Thanks. -Her name was Francesca Lavin. Yeah, I know. I better go notify the college. One of the most important decisions... a mystery writer faces... is the motive he gives to his murderer. Now, motives generally fall under a few basic categories, like... -Revenge? -Mm-hmm. A very common motive. The killer might want to right an old wrong... or settle a score. Depending on his psychological makeup, it might take only a playful insult... to bring his murderous impulses to the surface. What about jealousy? Also good. Not all of us are as smart or as rich or as beautiful... as we'd like to be. Sometimes this can create feelings of rage... which fester and grow until we feel the need to lash out... at someone who possesses the qualities we think we lack. -How about greed? -Greed. That covers a wide range of motives. People could be greedy for money or fame or career advancement. I've even heard of a student... who'd kill to get an "A" on a paper. [Bell rings] We haven't mentioned what motivates... the vast majority of murderers--love-- But we'll get to that next time. There's an article on my desk I'd like you to read. Please pick one up. Robert, that note you passed on-- When did my wife give it to you? Uh...yesterday morning, after the Milton seminar. Thanks. Sure. -Lattimore. -Oh, hi. Oh, hi, Mike. What's going on? I got some bad news, Charlie. One of your students was found murdered last night. -Francesca Lavin. -Oh, God. How did this happen? She was strangled at the Dockett Cove Motel. I told Lieutenant Dowling that it might have... something to do with your assignment. That was very thoughtful of you. -Think it's possible? -No. That assignment was a mental exercise. Come on. A roomful of people planning the perfect murder? I knew something like this would happen. Prayed, you mean. I hope your book makes you lots of money, Charles, because your academic career is coming to a close. MIKE: Henry, why don't you let me talk to Charlie, huh? I'll wait for you in my office. -He doesn't like you much. -Hmm. So, uh, how's class going? Fine, until now. Well, Potter does have a point. What do you mean? What is it you tell your students? Given the right set of circumstances, anyone is capable of murder. Maybe you provided them with the right set of circumstances. Oh, Mike. I'm just saying you may have unleashed something... you can't control. I just want you to be careful, OK? OK. I met Francesca with you at the party. She was a beautiful girl. She was attractive, yes. "She was attractive.” She was a knockout! Did you have anything going with her? -Come on, Mike. -I'm just doing my job, Charlie. Besides, I know what it's like for a guy in your position. Oh, really? What is it like, exactly? You and I both know this wouldn't be the first time. -What are you saying? -Nothing. But if I needed to know where you were, you could tell me, right? Yes, I could. But I sat home alone all night correcting papers. It wouldn't be much of an alibi. Mike, am I a suspect? I'm not saying that you are. No, but you're not saying I'm not, either. Forget it. The Lavin girl seemed like she got around. Maybe she fell in with the wrong bunch of guys, right? CHARLIE: Yeah. -What's this? -What? -This book. -The Big Sleep. Raymond Chandler. Can I borrow it? Why? You hate detective stories. Yeah, but I've been having insomnia. Maybe reading will help me fall asleep. It's called The Big Sleep, but it's not boring. Great. I'll have some fun while I'm up all night. Can I borrow the book? Thanks. -You all right? -Yeah, I'm fine, Mike. -You sure? -Sure. All right. Thanks. If you think of anything, give me a call. I'm worried about you. Thanks. Ha ha. Who's there? Why did you kill Francesca Lavin? W-What are you talking about? My wife didn't give you that note. Francesca did, so you were the only other person who knew... she was at that motel last night. I admit I lied to you, but that doesn't mean I killed her. -Prove it. -You mean an alibi? That would be a very good start. All right. According to radio reports, the murder took place between 8:00 and 10:00. I was attending Professor Palmenter's class... on the 19th-century English novel. That's a very large lecture course. You could have easily slipped out without being noticed. True, except that last night's class featured a paper... delivered by yours truly. Sorry to disappoint you. I take it the police don't know that you were at the motel. No. But it won't take them long to figure that out. Your only hope is to find the killer before they arrest you. Something like that. Maybe I can help you-- play Watson to your Holmes? Thanks, but I don't think so. I'd, uh, really like to. -Or? I could save the police a lot of legwork. I'd just tell them about the note. So we have a deal, right? Good. OK, now, the way I see it, we should just look at this as another assignment. First we should remember something you said in class. What was that? Whoever stands to gain the most from the murder... is probably the person who did it. Now, if you're implicated in the crime... y-you're through at Hampstead, right? The privileges of tenure don't include murder. I know at least one person... who wouldn't mind attending your going-away party. Professor Henry Potter. Not to mention how Laura will take the news... about my being in a motel with a beautiful undergraduate. -Looks like we have our man. -I don't know. I can't see Potter killing someone... just to get me out of his hair unless... -Of course. -What? I overheard Potter on the phone last night. He said, "I got your note. I won't let you do this." I thought it was Laura breaking the news... that she was meeting me at the motel. But what if it wasn't Laura? What if someone else was threatening him? Francesca Lavin. But what does she have on him? I don't know, but I know where to find out. [Knock on door] -Lieutenant? -Yeah. What have you got? The print. It was on the headboard. Way to go, Defazio. Check it against-- The student files at Hampstead. I did. It came up blank. -Did you try the FBI? -Yeah. Another dead end. I guess we're looking at a first-timer. All right, look. There's something I want you to do. -Strictly confidential. -Sure, boss. Run the print against this. Like I said, if they match, call me first. No. You call me only. Got it? Got it. -Hi. Hi. I just heard about Francesca Lavin. It's awful. I know. Did you see Potter last night? One of your students just died, and you ask about my love life? Humor me. No. I didn't see Henry. He canceled our date. -When? -I don't know. About 6:00. There's a rumor that you were having an affair with Francesca. Is it true? No. Would you care if it was, though? [Door opens] All set? Let's go. Stop it! [Telephone rings] Hello? Mike, it's for you. I'll take it in here, babe. -Hello. -Hi, boss. It's me. Sweetheart, go play with your sisters, all right? We'll do this in a little while. What did you find out? The prints on the book match the ones at the motel. OK. Sit on it till the morning. Mike? What's up? I think Charlie's in some kind of trouble. -Do you need that? -Yeah. Come on. Dinner's ready. [Bell tower bell ringing] ROBERT: Where did you learn this? CHARLIE: Research for my first novel. I interviewed a jewel thief named Fingers Frankel. Fingers Frankel? CHARLIE: I swear, that was his real name. Fingers said the trick was to pick the lock... without actually breaking it. I'm almost done with my Ryder paper. Did you find the real killer yet? Yeah. It was definitely the boyfriend. When Anne Ryder said she was leaving her husband, she told him. He got scared. He came over to break off the affair. They fought, and the lover stabbed her. Mm-hmm. He tried to make it look like a serial killer's work, not realizing that they were being arrested down in Florida. Right. He screwed up, so he had to frame someone else... before the police got any closer. That's why he put those files at Ryder's house. Ryder's been trying to sell that story for years. No one's come up with enough evidence to back it up. The files were in Ryder's desk at his house. He opened it to show you the paper he'd written... for the AMA review. You saw it, and then-- How did you know it was an AMA article? It was in the book. No, it wasn't. I left that detail out. I must have read it in an interview. CHARLIE: Let's look at this. "Dear Francesca, I've never experienced... "anything as powerful as what happened between us last night. "It was the greatest feeling..." This is revolting. So he's sleeping with her, huh? Not something the head of the English department should do. Especially if he wants to be with your wife. "Meet me at Primrose Park at 8:00. Francesca." It was all part of her perfect murder. She'd lure Potter to the park, leaving him without an alibi... for the time the murder took place. He followed her instead. Exactly. So, what's next? The confession scene. Can you put this in the professor's box? You bet. [Telephone rings] -Hello. -Hello, Mike? It's me. Were you asleep? Yeah. First night without insomnia in a month. I'm glad you called. I'd better say this straight out, even though it'll probably cost me my job. They found your print at that motel. I was there, Mike, but I didn't kill her. Meet me at the station first thing in the morning. No. Be at the old college theater at 10:00. MIKE: Why? I'm going to hand over Francesca Lavin's killer. Damn it, Charlie, this is not some murder game. -A student is dead. -Be there. WOMAN ON RADIO: The mood at Hampstead College today... remains somber in the aftermath... of coed Francesca Lavin's murder. Police say they have no suspects in the strangulation death... of Miss Lavin, 20. Late yesterday, large numbers of concerned parents... arrived at the school, fearful for their children's safety. College administrators are urging... both parents and students to remain calm. Police have told them that the crime does not appear... to be the work of a serial killer. MAN: Hey, Jason! [Whistles] -Good morning, Mary. -Good morning, Professor. Thank you. I need those copies by 3:00. -They'll be there. -Great. I heard an interesting story about Assistant Professor Stade. Is anything wrong? No. Nothing. Hello? Hello. Is anybody here? I don't know who you are. I got your note. Breaking into school property is a major offense. [Machinery clunks] And--and guilty parties are usually suspended, but... perhaps we can, uh, talk about it... pretend like it never happened? HENRY: Oh, it's you. What are you doing here? Potter? HENRY: Aah! Henry. Oh, God. Charlie? MIKE: I want you to stay right there. No! You don't understand! He's getting away! Who, Charlie? Whoever did this! Charlie. No one's going to hurt you while I'm here. Charlie. Charlie. -Mike. -Charlie. CHARLIE: I didn't do this! [Sirens] Uh, sorry I'm late, everybody. Sorry. Uh, thank you very much for waiting. Uh...uh...today I want to talk about one of the most... dynamic elements of any good thriller... uh, the chase scene. Um..um... imagine our hero as a fugitive from justice... hotly pursued by the law for a crime he didn't commit. He's trapped on the upper floor of a building... with no obvious means of escape, and he needs your help. Any ideas? Yes. Maybe he could shoot his way out. No weapons. He could jump out the window. Too high. [Sirens] What if he just walks out? Secure this area and seal the north gate. He's here. We're on our way. We got him! Lattimore's locked himself in his office. We got him surrounded. Charlie! Come on, Charlie. Open the door. There's nowhere you can go. OK, fine. Blow it. Charlie. Ha ha ha! I can't believe you guys fell for it. [Applause] Let's go. -Laura. -Aah! It's OK. It's me. I need your help. Laura, I really, really need your help. MAN: Ma'am, please move out of the way. -Morning, ma'am. -Morning. Something wrong? Just want to take a look. Come on. Don't you have anything better to do? This shoe belong to you? It's my brother's. Do you mind? OK. Move along. Hold it! Now what? Your trunk is open. Uh! Thank you! Where are we? A few miles from school. Before we go further, tell me what happened. I didn't kill him. You have to believe that. You see... you see, this is all so complicated. I thought Potter killed Francesca. What? All the evidence pointed to him. How could I have been so dense? I teach this to my students all the time. The most obvious suspect is hardly ever the actual villain. Charlie, who killed Henry? Robert Miner. Come on. I know Robert. Why would someone so harmless suddenly go on a murder spree? Why would he do it? I think I know. We have to get into his dorm room. Are you crazy? The campus is crawling with cops. Laura, will you just trust me, please? No! [Laura crying] Laura. Laura, look. Laura, I don't know what to say. I really don't, except that I'm sorry. I made Henry so unhappy. Are you kidding? You were the best thing ever to happen to him. Oh, no. Not after last night. I told him that it was over, that I was in love with someone else. Oh, come on. Come on. Oh, no. Come on, Charlie. No, I'm sorry. I...I just don't know if I can believe you. All right. All right. Let's just go, OK? GIRL: Lucky for you I'm tutoring a floor counselor... who dozes off during calculus long form. I'll wait in the lobby. OK, thanks. That extension you wanted? -Yeah? -You got it. Whew. LAURA: Ugh! CHARLIE: What is it? Lunch. He certainly is a fan of yours. CHARLIE: Some of the research on the Ryder case. LAURA: How does he know Tim Ryder? LAURA: "I can't tell you how much your love and support... "have meant to me"? I'm totally confused. Maybe this will help you. It's Robert's latest letter. Looks like he didn't have time to post it. "Dear Uncle Tim, "I've figured it out. "I know who killed Aunt Anne." Tim Ryder is Robert Miner's uncle? Not Robert Miner. Robert Michener. Tim's married sister lives in Iowa. I tried to talk to her, but she always refused. So Ryder's getting back at you through Robert. "MD." Come on. We have one more person to see. Who? Tim Ryder. Ryder's attorney worked it all out. You have 15 minutes with him tomorrow morning. You're going in as Joseph Pomerantz. Great. Do you have any idea how risky this is? All Ryder has to do is snap his fingers, and you'll be arrested. I know. Why are you doing it? I owe it to him, Laura. I've been thinking a lot about what you said. What? You know, about the book changing me. You were right. All my instincts told me Ryder was innocent. Then I found those files. As a writer, it was my job to tell the truth, right? So I took everything Ryder told me... including things he told me as a friend... and created this portrait of a killer. But you knew I didn't believe it. You knew I was betraying my gut feeling... in the name of some journalistic truth. After a while, that's all I could see in your eyes. So I started looking away. Well, the fact is, Ryder probably did kill his wife. I don't think so. But you searched long and hard... for evidence that would clear him. Maybe not hard enough. [Inmates talking] So? How do I look, hmm? Fit? 1 go two hours in the gym every day. I never went in for physical exercise before, but now... now I love it. When my lawyer told me you had new evidence to discuss, I knew it was another of your deceptions, but then I thought, "No. Let him come. "Let him see what he's done for me." I didn't put you here, Tim. The jury did that. You helped. You want to know the worst thing that ever happened to me? Annie's death. But can I tell you the second worst thing? It wasn't my conviction or being put in here. No, that simplified my life. No. It was losing you. The idea that you actually believed... I murdered my wife? I know that Robert Miner is your nephew. He's very smart, isn't he? I hear he's in your class. I guess you also know one of my students has been murdered. Robert mentioned it. He said the police think you killed her. Did you, Charlie? -No. -But you can't prove it, right? -Mm-mm. -How does that make you feel? Frustrated? Angry? Or does it all seem so unfair... that it takes everything in your power... just to keep from exploding? Come on, Ryder. You've had your fun. Now call Robert off before someone else dies. -You think I orchestrated this? -Didn't you? That's perfect. You get yourself in trouble, and you blame me. Sorry, Lattimore. You're not going to pin another murder on me. Tim. -Where did you get that? -From Robert. Why didn't you ever tell me about this before? There are some things I kept private, even from you. After reading your book, I'm glad I did. Annie really loved this pin. -She wore it every day. -When did you buy it for her? I didn't. She got it herself about a year before she died. She was always so proud of my being a surgeon. Then why did she have an affair? I was far from the perfect husband. Maybe she was trying to get back at me. You understand about that, don't you, Charlie? You used to talk a lot about your marital troubles. Of course, that was a ploy to get me to open up. Pretend to be on their side. They'll tell you anything. Isn't that it? Isn't that the way it works? Can I borrow that for a couple of days? Why? I'd rather not say. Why not? It doesn't mean anything anymore. By the way, your nephew has disappeared. Do you know where he is? Oh, come on, Charlie. You're the great detective. Think about it. Tim. I'm very, very sorry. For everything. You should be, Charlie. Come on, get me out of here. WOMAN ON RADIO: Police continue to search... for Professor Charles Lattimore in connection with... the recent rash of murders at the college. [Turns off radio] Are you sure about this? I know Ryder hasn't been able to unload the property. People get spooked... when they learn someone was murdered there. Ready? [Rings doorbell] I don't think he was there. Uh, look. If anything goes wrong, it's all in here. Charlie, if something happens to you-- Trust me. This is going to work. WOMAN: Good morning. Hey, Millie. Can I get two coffees and a-- It's Lattimore. All right, move out! [Sirens] Get me Lieutenant Dowling. OFFICER: Halt! Stop where you are! We have you surrounded! Give it up! OFFICER: Halt! Stay back, or I'll shoot! MIKE: Charlie, let me come in and talk this whole thing out. No guns. Whatever you say. I got it. Come on, Mike. Come in. In there. Come sit down. Sit down. Now, I don't expect you to believe what I say, but it's all true. Robert killed Henry Potter and Francesca Lavin. -Why? -To get back at me. See, Tim Ryder is his uncle. No. You got it all wrong. I thought Ryder had put him up to it, but I found out Robert had planned it by himself. It's not true. I didn't kill anybody. Only one person could have pulled this off. It's just like you said in class-- The least likely suspect is always the guilty party. I mean, don't you see? It's him. He's outsmarted you. There's no doubt in my mind that he did it. It's Mike Dowling. First it was you, Charlie; now it's me. Nice try, kid. Think about it. Only a cop could have enough information... to duplicate the cult murders, right? Come on! Charlie, let's go down to the station... before this gets any crazier. Dowling was the one having the affair with my aunt. She threatened to tell his wife, so he came over that morning in order to reason with her. But then they started to argue. Son of a bitch! You lied to me. MIKE: I never promised you anything. -You said you'd leave Ellen. -Come on, Annie. [Telephone rings] ROBERT: Dowling tried to make it look like a serial killing. When that didn't work, he blamed it on Uncle Tim. But he knew the evidence was flimsy, so he planted those files where he knew you'd find them. -This is a waste of time. -No, let him finish. He knew people would be influenced... by your conclusions about the case. One thing he counted on was that you'd never suspect him, and he was right. Even if this is true, how does it connect... with Francesca's death or Potter's? That was my fault. Once he found out... I was reopening the investigation with the class, he knew he'd have to stop me. He could have killed me, but he'd run the risk... of someone making the connection between the two cases. So he decided to shut down the class, and he was sure Francesca's death would do that, but you did something unexpected. -You didn't call the police. -I've had enough. Sit down, Mike. Sit down. Go on. ROBERT: When you built a case against Potter, Dowling was in trouble. An arrest, an investigation would drag on for months. None of this would solve his problem. He had to stop me right away. So he killed Potter, this time with the police standing... right outside the door. I was one of the investigating officers. Charlie, are you going to believe this creep over me? How long have we known each other? Don't trust him. He won't let us leave here alive. Other than Robert, only you knew Potter was at the theater... that night, Mike. That's it. Shoot me if you want to, Charlie. -I'm out of here. -Mike. I don't think you can shoot me, Charlie. Mike, you can't do this! Mike! -Mike, you can't do this. -Get in there. Sit down. Sit. Sit down! -Tie the kid up. -What do you mean, tie-- -Tie the kid up! -OK. OK. Come on, Mike. MIKE: OK, now what? Charlie, you're the expert. Write this thing for me. Sorry. I won't be part of this game. You have no choice. With the police outside, it'll be difficult to kill us and get away with it. True. As I see it, you can only do one thing. -What? -Give yourself up. Give myself up? That's the best you can do? I've killed three people! I can't just give myself up. MIKE: Uh, I got it. OK. How's this for the perfect murder? I came in, you made me tie the kid up... and then you shot him. I like that. -No. -Sorry, kid. No! Mike! Mike! Bye, old chum. Police! Drop it! Drop the gun! Hold on, please. Just-- OK. OK. The gun's going down. The gun is down, OK? Charlie Lattimore's responsible for the deaths... of Francesca Lavin and Henry Potter, and he just killed the kid. Book him. Let's get the paramedics in here... and call off that backup unit. -I'll make the call. -Right away. ROBERT: Lieutenant. Hi. Oh, just a few props, courtesy of the drama department. Blanks. Stage blood. Oh, and, uh, tape recorder. MIKE ON TAPE: That's the best you can do? I've killed three people! I'm afraid you've got the wrong man. How did you know? MD. Not medical doctor, but Mike Dowling. CHARLIE: Just like the one you gave your wife. Boss. We'd better go down to the station. You said to hold off revealing the villain... for as long as possible. A little too close for comfort. I know. You know what else I always say? ROBERT: Hmm? Once the villain is revealed... ROBERT: The story is over. When we started this course eight months ago, I said each of you would learn to write a decent thriller... by the end of the year. I'm happy to report that my prediction... was more than cautious. You've all produced outstanding work, absolutely outstanding... especially this. Has anyone seen Robert? [Bell rings] Anyway, congratulations, and have a great summer. Thank you very much. [Applause] Jon, when you see Robert, will you make sure he gets this? Sure thing, Professor. CHARLIE: I don't see what the rush is. LAURA: Remember what happened on our first honeymoon? Yes, I remember. Professor Lattimore! Thank God I caught you. Slow down, Robert. -My book. -Your book is excellent. I didn't agree with some of your personal descriptions-- Am I really thinning on the side, darling? Yes, darling. I sent the manuscript to an agent in New York... a couple of months ago. Oh, look, Charlie. Robert's going to be published. That's fantastic. I'm dedicating it to Uncle Tim. Very good. How is he? Great. I just spoke to him in California. He said to say hello. Good. Congratulations. It won't be much money, but what a thrill to have it published. Actually, here's the really amazing part. It's already been sold to the movies. Ha. You're kidding. No. The fee is in the low six figures. It's not much by Hollywood standards, but it's more than I've ever seen before. -Oh. -Or you, Charlie. Thanks for pointing that out, dear. Well, I wonder who will play me. Maybe Myrtle Streep. Myrtle? Myrtle Streep. -I'm sorry. -Cut! Myrtle? Myrtle Streep? Sorry. OK, everybody, back to one. Right now. Right now. OK, save the bells. What's taking so long? You look great. [Man singing] Then one day I knew Our love was really over It was over Ending like the fading colors Setting with the sun Now the end of winter Turns to spring And I find that I'm still remembering The love I always dreamed I'd find In summertime
