Come, let's go in there. - Anna, they brought the cake. - Go, I'm coming. Kids, the cake. Carlo, hurry up. You have to cut it. Do what your mom said. - I won't eat it. It's fattening. - Blow on it. Happy birthday, Carlo! Start serving it. - Here it is. - Carlo. Happy birthday. To many more to come. Enough! You have orange juice. - Can you give me orange juice? - Please. Can you give me orange juice, please? You said I'd slice the cake. Here, take it. Do you really have to go? Yes, don't worry. - I won't be late. - Promise me. I can't stay any longer. You opened this club for people who wanted to lose weight. Take advantage of it too. You need to get skinnier. I don't care about being fat. The warmth makes me want to make love. Don't even think about it. You could have a heart attack. - It's worth it. - Don't joke about it. You should see the veins on your neck. All right, but not because I'm afraid. Business first. Give me a cognac. It's worse than the one I make in Beirut. - How did it go? - The visit didn't go well. Did you leave? You must stay there day and night. Go! All right. Come on! I'm going home. I'll phone you later. Hey! Yes. I see, but I'll do whatever I want! Either they accept or they'll choke. - Franco! In the office, right now! - I'm coming. No, I want the whole area! Is that clear? He better understand that! Go ahead. Or Gusto and Cutitta will repent it. Hey, but you… He didn't want to go to bed. He wanted to wait to record your voice in the recorder that you bought him. I'd like to do that. We'll do it tomorrow. The cage wasn't enough for Gesmundo. He wanted to fly high, and eat so much. He didn't think that Nick had a good hunter. Your hunter is tired of shooting pigeons. Nick, it's nothing to laugh about. This time I'm quitting. Fine. Let's talk about it in my office. - Gesmundo was the last one. - Really? So what will you do? What's going on? Are you afraid? There has always been a bullet waiting for me. I've never cared. But now you do. I must quit. If I keep doing this, that bullet will get me and once my son grows up, he will have to give it back. I don't want him to avenge me. What's bad about that? It's our code of honor. - You can't change it. - You can keep it, then. I don't like this code anymore. Carlo must live a normal life. - That's why I quit. - Tony, you can't quit this job. You are either in it or you get killed. You are too involved. You always had orders from the top. You know everything, names, numbers, places… How many times did you leave it up to me? - Did anything ever happen to you? - Think more about it. You don't rethink something you've already decided. You taught me that. Alright. I'll tell the others in Paris. They won't all agree. It depends on how you ask them. Every man has two destinies. God decides what will happen to us in the afterlife. What happens on Earth is ours to decide. I'm proud of you for taking the right path. You have your father's blessing. You'll have God's blessing in Catania from Don Mariano. I told him that you were leaving today. Let's not make your mother wait any longer. Next time bring Anna and Carlo, please. - We rarely see them. - I'll bring them soon. - That is a promise! - Yes, Mom. - Good morning. - Hi, Domenico. Tony will be out soon. Alitalia Flight 239 to Milan, immediate boarding, Gate Three. Alitalia Flight 239 to Milan. Immediate boarding. Planes are never on time. Maybe there's traffic. There is still time. Here he is. You go ahead. Tony! I made it! - I'm glad. - I wanted to see you. Your father told me that you want to live in God's grace. I have been hoping for this for a long time. Take care of my parents. I will visit them often. Now you must go. Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming back. - We're meeting at 9 o'clock. Hurry up. - Yes, sir. - Hello, everyone. - Welcome. - Thank you. - You didn't respect the agreed time. I don't wait for anybody. It's hard to be on time with all these strikes. I thought this meeting was only for a few people. - Yes, only the close ones. - Isnello is one of us. If you care so much for your brainiac… - Speak as little as you can, lawyer. - Of course. Who will recite the requiem for Gesmundo? Nick, one of your men nailed him. Yours? Arzenta is not just yours. He works with all of us. I didn't come here to discuss childish matters! Let's talk about Gesmundo's inheritance, then. Right. I'd like to go on with his work. He made many mistakes. Especially in South America. I can fix them. - If I go to the Antilles… - Wait. That's too much. - I am there. - Nick! If we impede each other, we will ruin everything. I'm not impeding anyone. You should fill the Antilles with alcohol. People are sick of drinking. They want drugs. You give them baking soda instead of cocaine. You're a health fanatic. And what about Arzenta? - What about him? - Right, I forgot. - He wants to quit. - What? He wants to quit. He is serious about it. - Not at all. - It would be a mistake. - We could convince him. - What would you tell him? - We must take care of him. - No. He's a friend. I'll talk to him. - Hurry or you'll be late for school. - I'm coming, Mom. Get the keys to the other car. - Don't wake up your father. - Yes. Good morning. - What are you looking for? - Your car keys. Mom's car won't start. Come here. I'll come to pick you up. Tell Mom to come back soon. Daddy is going to pick me up. OK, give me the keys. Daddy said that you need to come back soon. How could this happen? I don't know. The wife and the son? Yes, both of them. Macaluso was a hundred meters away. It's a shame that will stay on us forever. We don't kill the innocent! He always used that car. We should have foreseen it. Now find a way to kill the only one that was supposed to die. - Make no mistakes! - Yes, don't worry. Find a safe place. I already told the others. I don't care about them. I'm not scared. If needed, I'll face Arzenta. Don't tell me to run away anymore. I didn't tell you to run away. I told you to be cautious. A little bit of caution, without your useless pride. That's it. You have children too. Right. Like Arzenta. Antonio. Take them and Don Mariano to the station. God bless you, Tony. - Take care. - Don't worry. Let God take care of justice. Fight the temptation of taking his place. God's wrath is bigger than yours and so is his justice. Move. I'll drive. - It's out of ammo. - Use the pistol. Lean over! Mind your business. Drive, go faster! - Where is he? - I don't see him anymore. He's here! Go back! Hurry! Hurry! One, two, three, four, five. This is the button… No. Hello? Hello? Mom, no lights are turning on. Open the door. It's Domenico. - What have you heard? - Nobody made a move. The cops are pretending not to know anything. - What about Gusto and Cutitta? - They are gone. But they unleashed all the dogs. You should leave. I know. I'll do it soon enough. What are you waiting for? Too many memories here. I'd go crazy. You can't do this alone. You need help. I'm ready. If you help me, they will all come after you. I don't care. Just call me and I'll come. You should decide about the refinery in Besançon. It's a good deal. No, it's a scam. Excuse me, it's Mr. Sladowski. Sit down. Go. It took you a long time to leave the Canary Islands. You, Grunwald and those half-Sicilian, half-Milanese are going too far. You can't do this or you'll end up like the story of the hangman. Kill yourself as much as you want but respect your commitments or… - Or what? - You have until tomorrow night. I don't want any interference in Germany. Not in Cologne or Frankfurt or Hamburg. If you try to screw me, I'll stop every delivery to and from Marseille. All right. I'll take care of this myself. A glass of champagne? Once it's all over, if there's anything to toast for. A girl, hopefully. You're always happier when your man comes home. Come on. I don't pay you to drink and play cards. Fill up my tub. I'll leave tomorrow morning and I don't want my daughter to wake up. Her slutty face would get ruined. Hello? Yes, Marcel. Yes? If they are such cowards, they can fuck themselves! I don't care. I'm not afraid of Arzenta. All right, bye. Are you still rooting for Arzenta? Of course. You know that he helped me once. He just helped you? Nothing else? For you everything happens in bed. That's the only thing you're good at. If the two Sicilians from Milan won't, I'll take care of Arzenta. I'll get you a black veil to go to his funeral. A transparent one and I'll send you there naked. Hello, Pierre? Yes, get me a coach on the train for Hamburg. What? I know that a plane would be faster. Can you find a jet that stops in those places that I need to? And so… Do what I told you to. The direct one. And stop bothering me. Come in the tub with me. You can massage me. Since you went to Indochina, you have this fixation! I beg you. You want to boil me, you jerk? You are the shrimp! Hello? Yes, it's me. Of course I'm interested. Don't call this number again. If you need to, call Domenico Maggio. He knows where to find me. Thank you, Sandra. - How long until Dortmund? - Almost an hour. Go outside and be careful. Right. Don't do anything stupid. Arzenta, I was against it. Your friends decided to do it. I had nothing to do with it! - Hi, Domenico. - Hi. There are 120 apartments. Before they find you there, you'll already have gotten rid of the others. Nothing will remind me of them there. I'll feel lonely. It's better than being a target for Cutitta's men. This thing must end. - What floor? - Number three. Good for jumping down. After you take care of those rascals. You have guts to follow me all the way here. Not more than you. I'm Montani, from Interpol. I don't like the smell of the cemetery. Leave, then. You're wrong. I respect your dead, even those that you killed. I'm talking about those found in a church and those on the train to Hamburg. It's always the same story. One man kills another. It starts a chain of vengeance and no one can stop it. I have no evidence to arrest you, and maybe it's not even a good idea. You are killing people who should be six feet under. - Out of my way. - Don't be so arrogant! I'm helping you. My men have made a protective net around you. Those who want you dead will stay away. Until we need you. Accept my offer and you'll live a longer life. To save my life, I should become a rat. I want to help you. Give us some information to get rid of that rubbish. No one will know. You wouldn't be the first to collaborate. Do you remember Marco Brusati? You came to the wrong person. - Who is it? - Tony, it's Sandra. Come in. - Hi. - Hello! Domenico said that you were here. This morning I called you. You didn't answer. I was out. - Sit down. - Thanks. - Want something to drink? - Don't worry, I'll do it. Thanks for the information. - I killed Carré thanks to you. - I wanted that too. - Did they bother you, then? - In some way. They found out who gave away the information. I ran away from Paris just in time. But they'll look for me here. I'll find a place to hide. - Want help? - No, you have enough problems. I came to give you news about Gusto and Cutitta. I wanted to tell you in person. Where are they? From what I heard, they ran to Copenhagen to discuss business with Grunwald. I think they are scared. Where will you go? To a hotel, then I'll decide. You can stay here, but don't make me feel your presence too much. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. May the grace and peace of God be with you. And with your spirit. Dear all, before we witness the mystery of the Eucharist, let's make an act of humility in front of God. Our friend is impatient. Let's say together, "I confess to God almighty." I confess to God almighty. After you. I'm not available. - Your Mass could have waited. - No, it couldn't. Grunwald, you can't understand things like this. Exactly. I don't understand. First you escaped from Milan… - No one escaped! - No one. We're here for Carré, as you requested. A request that was necessary to keep you safe, many kilometers away from Arzenta. Or am I wrong? You're wrong. He will go anywhere in the world. And you're also on the list. Everyone does as they want. But how did Arzenta get away with this so far? The police are protecting him. It's convenient for them if Arzenta kills us. So he nailed you. If he's this scary, then why don't you reason with him? You can't give him back his son and wife. I said reason, I didn't say buy. I heard that his mom and dad still live in Sicily. - Surely he loves them. - We won't touch his relatives. Last time it happened because of a damn mistake and we won't do it again. You have your methods, we have ours. That could have been the easiest method. Stop it, you're making me dizzy! Leave me alone! - Are you backing them? - For now let's leave Arzenta alone. Let's see how we can solve the issues with Carré. I agree. After all, that's why we're here. No? Sorry to interrupt you. I would like you to take a look at these diagrams to make a decision about Marseille. Yes, Marseille… And what if he leaves Milan to come look for us here? This is Grunwald territory. He should worry about it. Don't worry. Arzenta won't come to Copenhagen. If he does, I have friends at the train station and the airport. I'll know it immediately. This thing would be over once and for all. We can't have our life be dictated by Arzenta. Let's talk about business. Passport, thank you. Mr. Mario Cordero. Thank you. I have a little present for you, dear. How horrible! If you look at it this way, you're right. But don't let it fool you. If you take the first painting off… You'll see that it's a Rembrandt. It's wonderful! Thank you, dear. But why? - What are we celebrating? - Nothing important. But it will make you happy. I'm about to expand my influence… In all of Carré's territory. I love the Cote d'Azur. Those Sicilians will get upset. No, they won't. Tomorrow, thanks to my initiative, they'll have the dead body of a man they're scared of. Arzenta is in Copenhagen. Do they know? You won't tell them? It will be a surprise for them. There are not many holes here for a rat like Arzenta. Help me! Please, help me. Please, have mercy on me. That pig is surely outside waiting for me. He'll beat me up. He's drunk. You're not like the other men. Did you see them? No one moved. No one cares here. - You're not Danish, right? - No. Neither am I. I'm Italian. What are you doing in Copenhagen? Please, help me. I can't stay here. I'll come with you. Get dressed. Come to the car, at least. Wilfred is a coward. If he sees me with you, he won't touch me. I'm here in Copenhagen. I know they're looking for me. At least there's one less of them. I liberated you from Grunwald. In exchange, can you help me? Yes, I got shot in the arm. I'm at Churchill Park, in front of the monument. Hurry up. OK. They beat you up good. - Do you know anyone who can help me? - I know a doctor. Come on. Gusto and Cutitta are still alive. You won't make it if they find out. No, I'm not a part of their group. They need to leave me alone. I have people here. You did me a favor once. I can repay you. Come. Bring us some drinks. It's more of an honor than a surprise. You're welcome. Welcome to my humble place. It doesn't seem that humble. - You make good money, Dennino. - I can't complain. Small fish need little water to swim. But they go wherever they want, right? They go everywhere and see everything. Tell us about Arzenta. I don't have the honor of being a part of your family. Champagne? To our mother Italy! Fuck you, Dennino. We know that Arzenta is hurt. You know where he is. How much do you want? - Make an offer. - The good window of this place. And the license to start another one by the harbor. We are important in Copenhagen. - Just that? - What else? The City Hall? Be grateful. You can't have Grunwald's chair. You won't sit there. I don't want it. I know where my place is. So… What do you say? Fine, windows are expensive. It was just a scratch. Arzenta is fine. I sent him back to Italy. I had to do it. He's an old friend. How do you feel? - Good. - Perfect! Here, an Italian passport made in Denmark. You could play tennis with that arm! - When do you want to leave? - Right away. You will have the ticket and everything else. Now the advantage is yours. I think it will be even greater if you wait a few more days. They believed you? No, but all the same. I told them that I helped you. How did they take it? Not good, but they accepted it. I keep to myself and I work well in this town. But I can't do much more than that. Gusto and Cutitta will always bother me. If someone stopped them, I could do more. Alitalia Flight 288 to Rome. Immediate boarding, Gate 14. What's wrong? I'm tired of things like this. - It costs us a lot of money. - And so? - What would you like to do? - Make peace. Peace? What are you saying? Arzenta is tired. Get in touch with his friend… - Domenico Maggio. - Yes. - Set up a meeting. - I'm not meeting anyone. If you want to surrender, do it. The choice is yours. I want Arzenta dead. - Where is he running to? - The toilet. When he gets upset, his stomach starts to ache. Nick, I agree with you regarding wanting peace. I don't pay you to think. Understand? I told you we had to go right away. What are you waiting for? Find him and make him talk. Find a way. I don't care how. But do it quickly! Now let's see if this loyal friend will talk. Talk or I'll burn your head. Burn him. Put it out! He's staying at the Residence Europa! - What room number? - 203. What else do you want from me? Yes, he's here. - You're Carré's girl! - Now let's talk. - What are you doing here? - Answer! Carry on! Where is he? Tell us, now. Have you decided to talk now? Is he back? Use words. I don't understand signs. - He's not back yet. - Good. When will he arrive? I don't know. When he arrives, he will call you before coming up. Yes. Hello, Sandra? Yes. It's him. I recognized his voice. He's here in Milan. What? You idiot! Now he knows that someone is waiting for him. He's going to come bothering me. Listen. Come right away to my house and keep your eyes open. Before morning comes, I want to see him floating in the sewer. Wait, leave Damiano there. Give me Luigino. You are busy tonight. Come here. Let's go to sleep. Residence Europa. Shut up and stay calm. Don't stop, go ahead. - What happened? - Do as I say, keep going. Hurry up or he's going to get pissed. - Stop at the corner. - Right away. Wake up, Cutitta. They are showing a special program. And it's all for you. - I can't, let me sit down. - No, or you won't get up again. - What do you want to do? - Get away from here. I'm tired of killing for revenge. It's useless. - Where can we go? - To my house in Donnalucata. Tony, to your parents, I am nothing. You suffered a lot to help me. This bond is stronger than many more. I'll help you. Don't bother, I'll do it myself. Put everything inside, please. I'll worry about your things. See if he's woken up. Don't feel like a stranger. This is your house too. Tell them why I'm here. I don't want to take anyone's place. Relax, I will tell them. Your company is the best medicine, Tony. The cure that I need. - How are you? - Fine. - How did the harvest go? - I can't complain. For me this will be the last one. The sun shines on too much grief. You should have waited before bringing a woman here. Look at the marks on her face. She got them so I wouldn't get killed. Forgive me, Tony. Forgive a poor, old man. She'll be safe with us. This is my father. - Welcome to our house. - Thank you. I'm not going to his funeral. It's too hot there. You can't miss it. What would they say? I told Cutitta to forget about it. He didn't do that and now he's paid for it. Why don't they bury him in Milan? A grave is a grave. In Palermo he'll rot sooner. OK, let's do what we have to do. You talk to Don Mariano. - Do you still want to meet Arzenta? - Yes. I want to live. In this heat, that casket is a bomb waiting to explode. No, it has a double layer of zinc. Luca, you were hoping to see two caskets, weren't you? - Two or none, what do I care? - You prayed for that! You wanted me dead as well. You bet on the wrong horse. It's a horse that I saved. If Arzenta returns to work for you, you can thank me. You're right. Thanks. You had me come here for this? Did you hope that I'd ask you to join my family? - Why not? - Never. Grunwald's organization needs a new boss. I thought that you would be perfect. Thank you. May I? Don Mariano! Please. Hi, Tony. - Good morning. - I heard that you were back. - Welcome. - Thank you. - How is your father? - Not well. - Would you like a glass of wine? - On the terrace, so we can talk. - Sandra, get the wine. - OK. I bring you a proposition of peace. - From Nick Gusto? What does he want? - A friendly meeting. What a friend! I know how you feel, but Gusto is the least guilty regarding what happened. It was him that didn't want any harm to come to your parents. When you wanted to quit, it was the others who opposed it. - I spoke to him. Meet him. - No, I don't trust him anymore. He swore that none of his men would touch you. His daughter is getting married soon and Nick would not spill blood on such a beautiful day. He decided that the wedding will take place here in Donnalucata. The Arzentas will be the first invited. You couldn't ask for a better guarantee. Don't go without it. No, I don't need it. You know you can't trust him. It will be fine. You'll see it with your own eyes. - You can't ask me that. - I'm asking you. Only your family was invited and I'm not part of it. Yes, now you are. Go get ready. …for love and prosperity in which your name will be blessed for centuries to come. It's said, "Have mercy on us, Lord." "Let us both get old and healthy." This is the word of the Lord. From the Gospel according to Matthew. One of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, "Master, which is the great commandment in the law?" Jesus said unto him, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind." "This is the first and great commandment." "And the second is like unto it." "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." "On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." This is the word of the Lord. If it is your intention to join in marriage, join hands and express in front of God and his church your consent. I, Corrado, take you, Maria, to be my wife. I promise to be true to you in sickness and in health, in good times and bad times, to love and honor you all the days of my life. I, Maria, take you, Corrado, as my husband. I promise to be true to you in sickness and in health, in good times and bad times, to love and honor you all the days of my life.
