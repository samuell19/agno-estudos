18...19...20...21...22...23...24...25... What’s this? - I don't know, sir. Don’t act innocent like a school kid, Sudarshan. - Sir... You should find out. - Okay, sir. Call him. It's ringing, sir. Hello, sir... I'll arrange it by next week. This is no EMI to pay in installments. I didn't file a case because Lawyer Ravi referred you. In case I did, you'd have to pay the lawyers in millions. Is the SI available? - He's upstairs. Hey! I need one lakh in my hand in an hour. Or else, you’ll be behind bars. - Sir, greetings... Hmm... Tell me. I’m Mukthi channel’s Program Head. I know DGP Mr. Bhaskar really well. You're here to tell me that? - No, sir. What is it then? - I'm here to file a complaint. What? 3 lakhs were robbed from me on my way from the Bank. How much did you have in total? - 3 lakhs, sir... Tell me what happened in detail. I went to the Vara Lakshmi Bank, sir. Hey, you don’t know my background. Let me teach you and your Bank a lesson. One phone call and you'll be fired. Sir… Sir…You settle our issue, please. There's no limit to their fraud. What's the matter, boy? I told mom I'd clear sister's fee today. I withdrew money from their ATM to deposit in their Bank. But they say the notes are fake. Isn't it obvious that the notes are fake? Hey! Don't say that again. Chill, bro. You got the fake notes at least. Some got no notes at all. You don't get it, sir. I feel so furious. Bro, don’t be raged. You'll only get BP and diabetes. Not a solution, am I right? Got my point? Got it, sir. - What'd you understand? I came to the Bank for money and you taught me how to make some. Hey, you fool! Are you out of your freaking mind? What’s wrong, sir? - A guy just spit on my van. Remember you told me. We'll get nothing out of being raged. How can you be so furious yourself? - What the hell! I keep blabbering crap. Don't bring it up now. Devotion alone isn’t enough. You need to be fearful as well. Sir, Do something. There's a writer downstairs. File your complaint with him. Can DGP Bhaskar help? Influence isn't going to work. You wouldn't be here if it did. - 3 lakhs, sir... File a complaint and leave. I'll call you if we have anything. Sudarshan... Sir... Who's in the Ameerpet batch? Who else? It's the Erra Srinu's batch. Erra Srinu, ah? - Yes, sir. There are three of them. They grew up together since they were kids. Whatever they do, they do it together. One of them is called Oscar. Oscar level actor... His task is to study the candidate they target. The second one is Sobha Raju. His specialty is timing. His task is to divert the targeted candidate. And the third one is Erra Srinu. He's the Team Leader. To describe him in simple terms.. His only need in the world is money. When he has the money, he's lost in his own world. When he doesn't have it, he's in the outside world. What? Are you describing him or me? Sir!

When my dad couldn’t get a visa in Dubai… And was lying on a bench in the airport... He was accused of planting bombs and locked up. Believe me, sir. Sir, what money are you talking about? We don't get it. Sir! We promised Goddess Peddamma last dusserah. Since then, we quit robbery. I'm telling the truth. Believe me. Forget that. Tell me where the money is, idiots. Sir, we weren't even in the area at that time. Oh, my! Oscar! Alas! You killed him! He has a brain tumour since childhood. Doctor said he can't take any kind of shock. He's dead now. Damn it! Call an ambulance, sir. Give us your jeep at least. Hey... I heard electric shock cures brain tumour. There’s no power cut anytime soon, right? - Sir! Sir... Sir... Don't you think this is unfair? Will you kill him without a single proof? What gives you the right to do so? You can't kill an accused through electric shock. Sobha Raju, I’ll die first. - Sure. 302… - Sir... How much current kills a man on the spot? - 1000 volts, sir... Put it on 2000. - Okay, sir. He might die for real. Sir... Sir... Sir... No, thanks. Forget it. My grandma says I'd go to hell if I'm electrocuted. Hey! This is far better than hell. Sir is like God himself. We can't cheat him. No. Give me the money. Let's give him. You rascal! - Get up, man. Get up. What happened? What are we doing here? How come you're here, sir? Hey, show me the money. Come on... It's only 2 lakhs. Where's one more lakh? Come on, sir... We've been in debt since 6 months. We had to spend it. Sir... Sir, do I file a case? - We should find the money for it. Sir, we'll leave. Hey, touch the camphor. Only God can save you. No way, sir. If God was real, he wouldn't have caught us. Shut up and do it. [CHANTING] Sathi... - Hmm... May you live long! Master, we performed such a powerful ritual. Our work will be done, right? I have pacified the five elements and nine planets. Didn't my predictions come true since 15 years? Reminisce how you have reached this stature. You know it all, Master. I was an illiterate working as a gate man at the movies. So, no one was ready to offer me a bride. I got raged and came to Hyderabad from Palakollu by train. I was roving around jobless when a guy asked me for directions. Since then, I've been termed as a Real Estate broker. You know I've grown gradually since then. How much are your savings? - Around 800 probably... Millions! When an illiterate man is earning millions... Doctors and software engineers are praying for lakhs. There's a thin line between being hopeful and greedy. I know, sir. I've bought 10 acres in Shamshabad recently. You registered the land at the worst of times. We know you cussed me soon after I did that. That land was sold without the owner's notice. The land owner filed a case in the court. I'm having a hard time claiming the land. There are 300 flats in this area. I could only sell half of them. I'm desperately looking for buyers for the rest. As you performed this ritual, time will be favourable. Your planetary positions are under complete control. A great man is coming your way to ascend your stature. He will only change your life. Really, Master? When will he come? How is he going to come? How do I recognize he's the one? He'll rise like the blazing sun amidst rays of dawn. He'll appear as Lord Vishnu in meditation. Before the blink of your eye... He'll eliminate your ignorance and bring auspicious times. Wow! I wonder where this great man is. Hey, no! No, what? We'll settle down in one shot. It is worth 20 million. Hey, it's a God's idol. Please. Let's not do this. Because he’s a God, he wouldn’t complain. He wouldn't get dramatic. He has to fulfill everyone’s wishes. That is why he was made God. Uh-huh... I don't feel good about this. Okay. You guys stay here. I'll go in and be back. We'll stay back. You go. What’s with him? - Calm down. Hey...! Catch him! A thief! Catch him! Go look for him. Go… - Hey...! A thief...! A thief...! Hold him! Catch him, guys! Come on... Come on... Hey, stop! Stop right there! Look... Where'd he go? He must be somewhere around. Let's go that way and look. He must be hiding. Look.. 'He'll rise like the blazing sun amidst rays of dawn.' 'He'll appear as Lord Vishnu in meditation.' [PHONE BUZZING] Hello... Good news, bro! The Shamshabad site owner passed away last night. We get the 10 acres. Before the blink of your eye... He'll eliminate your ignorance and bring auspicious times. Master...! [CHANTING] Hey! Where am I? Everyone should pose the same question to one's self. 'Where am I? What's my purpose of life?' Saint has preached the essence of Vedas in a sentence. Hail, Saint Krishnananda! Hail, Saint Krishnananda! Who do you think I am? 'Who am I?' A question beyond comprehension... Only Bhagavad-Gita has the answer to this. That is what Saint meant. Hail, Saint Krishnananda! Hail, Saint Krishnananda! You are here! You're finally here for me, Saint! This is not fair, Saint. Why do you look down upon poor devotees? I've been waiting for 20 years and yet, I couldn't get to see you. You've finally manifested at my workplace, Saint. Saint...! I feel emancipated. This is once in a lifetime experience. All my prayers are finally paying off. My wishes have been fulfilled. I feel fortunate, Saint. Loved by his devotees...

Hello... My dad was wrong assuming you're a great man. You didn't just lose my dowry in your politics. You made a debt for 300 million and fell to the ground. You've been to all the parties to be an MLA since 10 years. You couldn’t even become a Corporator. Shame on your life! Okay. What now? I just returned from Karnataka Elections Campaign. Why'd you call? Are you coming back home? Don't think I'd come back to that shameful life. You don't remember your son's birthday but Karnataka Elections, you do. How would I remember? You come home once in 6 months. You cuss me till you're done and leave. I am helpless for having to be your wife. But you increase the debt irresponsibly. Hello, sir... Expenses were 14,600 rupees. We didn't pay the electricity bill since 6 months. When the meter was going crazy, I switched it off. Let's pay it soon. By the way, what's with all the clamor, people and this carnival? When you weren't in the city, on top of our apartments... Saint will only wash away your sins here. You’re accountable for your good deeds. Please come, son... Son, Saint's shrine is like River Ganges. You should wash away your sins here but not carry them home. Hey… - Bro... I need you to do something urgently. He said he’d make the God’s idol vanish. But he has vanished now. I feel really hungry. Hey...! What is he doing up there? - Go fast, guys. Queue will increase. Queue, ah? What's all this? You were fine up until now, right? - He's been feeling weak since 4 days. We don't know what the illness is. We just realised it. You'll be fine. What happened to him, son? He has seizures every time he watches a miracle like you. Really? It's because of his sins. Now that you are here, I'll cure you. You’ll be fine… Brother… - Brother…I'm cured of cancer. It's not cancer. You had paralysis. Isn’t it cancer if my arms and legs feel numb? - You've been showered by his grace. Stay back and offer your services to Saint. Master...! Greetings, Master... Dude, tell me this. Who are those guys in the pictures? Is it some 'Wanted' list? Like I know them... They must be foreign Saints. A few foreigners brought them for me. - Oh... Is Lawyer Ravi home? - No, bro. I just looked. Office is still locked. - He isn't there? Where'd he go? What is this? You took 50 million promising to get me an MLA seat. You’re just returning 20 million now. Do I look innocent to you? Don't say that. Assume I've given the 30 million for Party Fund. I'll get you a seat in the next elections. I'm a Minister now. Believe me. I believed you once and you didn't deliver. Bhavani, where'd you find this guy? Politics isn't like the share market. You don't get profits right away. You need to keep investing and wait for profits. Why don't you tell him? Sundar, listen to me. It was my childhood dream to build a star hotel in the city. He is anyways a Minister now. He’ll get us a good site in the city. Invest your 30 million in it. I'll invest the rest. Three of us will have equal shares. - Isn't that a great deal? Business with you guys? A broker who offers a seat for 2.5 million... And a loafer who makes false promises for 50 million... I don't deal business with either of you. I invested 50 million. I'd invest another 10 to expose you two. I don’t care about money. I can earn it with time. I'll go to America alone and... You call me a broker, huh? Do I look like a broker to you? Hey... Even my dad never yelled at me since childhood. I argue only in court. When I'm outside... Oh, my god! He couldn't understand money is powerful than humans. Hey, what'd you just do? What, huh? This is his life's worth. You get 30 million and I get 20. This is a Government guest house. That's why I killed him. What kind of a man are you! Sir... He's not a criminal lawyer. He's a criminal first. He went completely after his dad. Next time you get a call, find out what it is about. You put me through hell. I'll faint out of fear. Shame on you! Get in. Bloody idiots! Tell me, Ravi. - Where are you? I'm in the station. Get an ambulance to Minister's guest house urgently. Who is he? NRI... He was being a stud. Looks like a patriot. He explored the world and finally died here. Guys! Anyways, China Babu called. What is it? He called me as well. He said it's something urgent. Urgent, ah? What are these guys doing here? What? It's Erra Srinu and his batch from Ameerpet. They're some really wicked men, I say. Saint, the Shamshabad site is now mine due to your grace. I got a profit of 50 million. You have to accept your share of 10 percent that is 5 million. You can't deny me. It’s not his share, son. It's an offering. We stand unparalleled to give Saint a share. Devotees cannot comprehend your miracles, Saint. You compel me to talk on your behalf. I'm blessed. These guys are up to something. Let me lock them up and... Are you out of your mind? How much would you loot if you become DSP? 500 million? Hmm... How much would you loot as a future Minister? 5 billion? He's God. We can loot around hundreds of billions. So, find out who conspired this scam. Who else? It's the priest with the head gear. Ask the priest to visit our office once. Why don’t you say anything? You were meditating, so... I was making the best out of spare time. Meditation is man's essence of life. You tell me. What's your opinion about the Saint? It's remarkable. He's a manifestation of Lord Vishnu. He descended to Earth straight from Dwaraka. How can you be so sure? Mankind doesn't exist based on mere reasoning. Did you know oxygen is an essential gas to live when you were born? When did you realize sunlight decides your existence? All our thoughts arise from God. We are just players in his game. Didn't I tell you he is insane? We had a thought. - What's that? We want to offer our services to Saint's devotees through a Trust. So be it! It's God's master plan for you to do so. Go ahead. He is aware of everything. We wish to seek his blessings before we start. That's no issue. Let's go right now. A lawyer, politician and a cop... You seem like the three Lords to me. Let's go. Look, guys... This is unfair. Builder Sathi Babu brags about being a sincere devotee. He gave us 1000 bucks less. Who's going to pay up? Really? You be cautious, man. Don't believe anyone. People are all about betrayal. Would he give us a concession of 100 bucks ever? Damn right! Hail, Lord Krishna! Damn! Somebody is here. Saint, pardon me for interrupting your alone time. The thing is, they aren't aware this is your play. They wish to establish a Trust to offer you services. Trust, ah? Right, Saint. We'd start a Charitable Trust and offer our services to you and your devotees. China Babu, don't preach the Creator on his creations. Huh? There's nothing Saint doesn't know. I brought them as they wanted to seek your blessings. Hmm... You can leave now. Er... If Saint goes through the document and signs... Go ahead. God bless you! This Trust shall conquer the highest altitudes. Saint, we'll take leave. Hey, what'd you just do, man? Did you sign the papers? Did you donate your entire property? SI s a big criminal. The lawyer seems way too cunning. You ruined our lives with a single signature. We don't have time for that. Let's take these 5 million and leave the State tonight. Bro, I love you! You've settled our lives. No one on Earth can stop us now. How’d you get this cell phone? - I bought it. Where’d you get the money from? - The money you've been looking for... I used it. I'm talking to you. How could you steal my money and buy a cell phone? You are a show-off. - What do you expect? You were behind me about my wedding since I graduated. Be it my faulted horoscope or insufficient dowry... Every alliance slipped out of our hands. Since then, you make me sleep in temples as a part of rituals. I can't do this anymore. I'm bored of staying at home. Ugh! What's the matter? You’re always blaming me. Do you know what your daughter did? She stole my money and bought a cell phone with it. You could ask me for it, dear. - What the hell! I'm hungry. Serve lunch first. Sure, I will. I can’t waste any food. Let me get back to the both of you. I’ll have you pay every single penny back. Watch me do it. Hello… - Brother-in-law, where are you? I'm home. I told you about God manifesting on our terrace, remember? He’s Saint Krishnananda. He's really powerful. You know Builder Sathi Babu, right? He was in sheer debt. He hit a jackpot overnight after seeking the Saint's blessings. Forget others. I had diabetes, right? I'm cured now that I've met the Saint. Come here with Vasu right away. Her faulted horoscope will no more be an issue. She'll be married within a month. Hey, I'm busy this entire week. I'll drop by later. Come on... Slowly... Hey! Put it back! Unlock it. Hey… - What? There's an auto coming. Whoa! Get down. Right now... Guys, let's go that way. Are we going back up? Giri... Hey, Giri… - Who is it? Coming, sister… - Shut up. Hush! Open the gate quickly. - Coming... Who’s visiting at this hour? - What took you so long? Didn’t brother-in-law come? - He gave the same excuse as always. He said he'd come in a week, uncle. He can't come unless our God permits. Let's go. What are you doing, man? What if someone looked? Okay, let’s go. - Go where? Seriously? What’s wrong? Too many mosquitoes... Idiot! I asked what’s wrong with him. You heard him. Seems he lost his mind. I get it if he lost his mind over alcohol. How could a girl do this to him? Don't you get it? We are fated to live in misery. Hey, what's the solution? Like you said, alcohol is the only resort. It must be his way out at last. I'll go back to UK, man. If you mention Uppada Kothapalli as UK one more time... I'll smack your face. Go to sleep. She's asleep. So heavy... Huh? What's this? Money! Let me watch TV. The fan... Oh, boy! What are you doing here? What is it, man? Are you in love? Think about it. - You...! No! No! No! Bro, I can't put them on. Shall I take them? You're truly a God. Bro, I'll keep these as a memory. Give it back. Please let me take these. - I'm pleading you. Please give them. I put so much effort in taking them. - Don't make me put my hand to work. Give me. You put them on. Idiot! Saint... This is my daughter Vasudha. She isn't getting married due to some mishap. You have to help us get her married. Saint... Saint... Dear, Saint is analyzing your daughter's issue. His glance brings bliss to us. Let's go. Bro, my darling is leaving. Do something and stop her. - This is too much. Ma'am... - Huh? Miss Vasudha... Saint is asking you to stay here for 21 days. Why is that, Saint? You see... 21 days of worship to Lord Shiva helped Goddess Sita attain a husband like Lord Rama. In case your daughter serves Saint for 21 days... She'll attain a husband like Lord Rama. What does she have to do for 21 days, Saint? Prayers in the mornings and evenings… Offering to sing a lullaby in the night... All these services will bring her good results. What do you say, Saint? - You're eternal. Whom do I serve? Who else, crazy girl? Saint himself... Pulla... Pulla...! There's something wrong in the way he looks at me. 21 days... I can't do it. Girl... I know how to deal with this stuff. Leave it to me. Auntie… - Hmm? You've dropped quite a few pounds. A daughter like her makes life tough for me. Only I can handle her. Auntie, you know our Central Minister Smriti Irani, right? She introduced a new scheme for educated girls. So what? All the educated girls have to report in Delhi. If you agree, I want o take Vasudha along. You two have spun a great plan. You thought I'd believe anything you say? If she tries to skip 21 days of worship… I'll break both your bones. Mom! I can’t do it. And I don't think he's a Saint. He sees me with wrong intentions. Shame! You'll be cursed. You can't fault God's glances. I asked her to sleep in a temple for 3 nights and she said some guy fell on her. She is full of lies. Why don't you tell her? It’s wrong, dear. You can't say such things about him. I'm a great example. I consulted every doctor there is regarding my diabetes. I'm cured of diabetes due to the Saint's grace. No matter what everyone says, she doesn't pay heed. She and her dad are way too stubborn. It must be my karma. - Vasu, listen to us for once. Ugh...! ♪I feel my heart pounding I sense my body shaking♪ ♪I know my mind is wavering I wonder what happened to me♪ ♪She surround me all over She twisted my heart in knots♪ ♪It's a feeling unexplored but it feels great♪ ♪As your hand caressed me, I felt intoxicated♪ ♪My world has changed in a snap♪ ♪Listen up!♪ ♪I ponder over the thought of losing myself♪ ♪I probe if this is a dream or the reality♪ ♪I cherish a million years in a minute♪ ♪Is it dawn or dusk?

Does a Saint wear such t-shirts? T-shirts and pants are for humans. God can wear anything and act as he pleases. I told you already. Go away from here. Go! - Ugh! You've gone crazy. She’s a kid at heart. She is speaking out of ignorance, Saint. Forgive her. Hail, Saint Siddhesh! Hail, Saint Siddhesh! Hail, Saint Siddhesh! Those who received the flowers graced by the Saint... They can come forward and share their difficulties. Were you graced first? I’ve been married thrice now. Not one husband is loyal. They are all behind my money. I'm vexed with my life, Saint. Your story makes me feel vexed as well. Donate all your sinful properties to my Trust. Serve me in private. You'll be blissful. There are no CCTV cameras in my bedroom, are they? Come on, Saint… Stop kidding. - I'll give you a fruit. Have this fruit. You'll feel peaceful. Accept this as my offering. Put it there. Hail, Saint Siddhesh! You are exposed, man! Who the hell are you? - This maniac manhandled God himself. Kill him! I comprehend your frustration. But I'm a public servant. I’m Doctor Chaitanya. I'm a rationalist. I can perform better tricks than him. You believe he is God but his real name is Koti. He's a cheat performing gimmicks on the streets of Rajahmundry. I'm not angry with devotees like you. Disguised in the name of devotion, he manipulates your weaknesses. I'm angry with such loafers. So, I was in the hermitage for 6 months under cover. I found out every little detail. Before 10 years, his Bank balance didn't add up to 5000 bucks. It's 300 million as of today. Here are the bills he spent on massages in Bangkok and gambling in Sri Lanka. It's all your money. Officer, please come and arrest him. Only a fellow human being can help us in hard times. Believe in your hard work and intelligence. Not in imposters like him. I heard you are God. - Who told you this? Everyone says you are God. Seems you make everyone's wishes come true. Eesha... Eesha... Eesha... My mom is coming. Tell her I'm not here. Eesha... Eesha... Greetings, Saint… Have you seen my son Eesha around? He's not here. He went downstairs. Uh-huh? Okay then. I'm also going down. Thank god! Mom, are you still here? - Dad's off to work. You’re my sweetheart, aren’t you? Let's go. You sound so sweet when somebody's around. But you'll scold me once we get home. I know. Come on, dear... We can't be bothering the Saint. Let’s go. - You go. I'll come later. You go, ma'am. I'll send him. Hmm... Come on, dear... Tell me. What do you want? Will you make any wish come true? Yeah. Tell me what you want. You know... Mom doesn't let me out of the house. You are God, right? Tell me how to escape mom's vision. Is that it? Come... Let me show you. In case mom's watching TV... You should go hiding from behind. Hey! I got you! Moonlight was amazing last night, eh? Yeah. I forget everything watching you under the moonlight. Really? Hail, Saint Krishnananda! Hail, Saint Krishnananda! Get up now. You can leave. What is it? We got a bottle for you as well. I’ve been dying to talk to her since 15 days. And you guys are behind alcohol. What do you want me to do now? I have to talk to her somehow. Hey... Vasudha ma'am... Saint has something to preach you. Come here… - Not now, man. Where are you coming? It's for unmarried woman. Are you planning to get married again? Hmm... Go... Go... I wish we had 24 hours in a night. Hey! Is this what you do in the name of prayers? No, uncle. We’re in love. - My foot! Uncle... Please listen to us. Love... Humans have to love. You become human when you love. Anyone can feel love at any point of time. You, me and everyone else... If you discard it as a sin, you wouldn't realise what you're losing. Try to understand. Please... Once love blooms in the heart... Even God doesn't hold the power to kill it. You know? I'm saying this with that very confidence. When someone says they're in love, accept them. Don't deny them. It's really wrong to do so. It's a sin. There's love in every human being. Love is valued only when you comprehend it. I stayed back to tell you this. I don't know how I can sound any better. Try to understand. Saint...! I assumed falling in love is a sin. If you didn't preach the greatness of love... I'd kill them both, Saint. Forgive me. I'll have them married with your blessings. I'll take leave now. Have some more. Get lost! You think it's meat that I'd want more? What's this, man? Eh? Leafy vegetable dal... Were you expecting me to get biryani? - I didn't mean the food. I'm trying to talk to her and the devotees are always around. Bro, my plans don’t suck like his. You're talking to the girl tomorrow. Stick to that. Bro… Watch what happens now. My phone... Have you seen my phone? Have you seen my phone? - What is it? What's the matter? I can't find my phone. Have you lost your phone? You don't have to worry. Saint will find your phone through his mystic vision. Saint, stop over acting and tell her where the phone is. In the third row from behind... It's in the pocket of the second guy. Wow! It's a miracle! It's a miraculous miracle! 15 years, 8 districts, 40 cities, 172 police stations, 272 SIs and CIs, 2000 policemen... I'm a thief none of them could dream of finding. I'm a thief! But you could find me in such a huge city. Who are you, sir? Are you here to catch me, leaving worldly pleasures of heaven? Are you Lord Krishna himself? Wow! [LORD KRISHNA's HYMN] Come here, man. Come on… - What is it? What are you here for and what are you doing? - How was my song? Was it amazing? It was really bad. Give me the phone. - Wait on... I've got another hymn. No more hymns. Give me the phone. When will your ego and superiority end? He's back at it. Didn't you have enough of the betrayal and wealth? She's a Princess the world adores. A serene beauty men would wage a war for... A woman who's an epitome of fidelity... How can such a damsel be...? Get lost! Hail, Lord Sri Krishna! Hail, Lord Sri Krishna! I’ll collect my payment tomorrow. Come get whose phone this is. She's coming. This is your chance. Talk to her. Saint, I lost my scooter in 2013. Use your mystic vision and find my scooter, please. I lost my wife at the Pushkar, Saint. I lost my LG TV. I lost my bike. - I lost my laptop. I lost my iPhone, Saint. - I lost my gold necklace. I lost my watch. - Was this your master plan? Hey, stop the car. Hey, boy... Give me some of the offering. Enough... What’s with your crazy beliefs, mom? You know you caused... I know I caused a traffic jam. - Not just traffic. Your life and it's development is also jammed. Whoa! Development brought nothing but havoc to our lives. Hey… - You drive... You know that man really well, right? Why don't you ask him about your PF? You think he is so jobless? What do you have to do with money anyways? I know. You are so reckless about our work. If it's for the people, you hurry up to help. Okay. You drive. Bro, Tell her directly. We'll handle if something goes wrong. We are with you. - Bro... Hey, all the best. Saint... No! No! Tell me, Saint. Ah! Please don’t call me Saint. I start losing my mind. Why, Saint? - Damn it! Why would I be a Saint? I'm no Saint. I stayed back for you and they made me a Saint. Yeah. I saw you for the first time in the temple. I felt so disturbed that very moment. When I saw you here again, I felt you were born for me. That is why I stayed back. I know you also... I'll expose you right now. Being a thief, you're in the disguise of a Saint. You're finished. - Sister... Sister... Please… He was really ignorant. - People will kill him if they know. I'll let the cops deal with you. Let me go. Wow! You fell at a girl’s feet for your friend. You're true friends, man. Go away. Hey! You only stole my phone, right? I get it now. You are all from the same gang. Let me teach you a lesson. - Sister... Sister... Hey! Decide on his love first. - Listen to me. Only then will you move from here. - Let's go down first. What the hell, man! Your issue shall be settled today. I need her decision and I shall risk my life for it. That’s it. - Hey! You didn't just steal my phone. You are talking way too much as well. He says he loves you and you're behind your phone. Here you go. Take whichever phone you want. iPhone, Samsung... I have all varieties. Is one enough or do you want all of them? Tie this around your waist. Come on... Bloody phone! Bro, you don't understand women. God has gifted them with a spark in their eyes. They walk around the street throwing glances at us. You quit food and sleep thinking of her like a fool. But these girls lie down on their couch, enjoying music. At midnight, they send smiley emojis to such idiots and feel happy. Vasudha... Vasu... Saint... Hey, let go... Mom! He's not a Saint. He's a thief. They form a batch. - It's her mom. Oh, my! - They're fooling everyone. What? You've finally called the Saint a thief. Saint, since she came here, she cooked up several stories to quit the worship. She is a big fat liar. Mom, I’m telling the truth. - Shut up. She's a big thief herself. Do you know what she did? She stole 10,000 bucks from me and bought a cell phone. On top of that, she's calling you all thieves now. We are all thieves. Why do we have to fight? Let's be together. Saint, you have to get some sense into her. - Mom, how do I tell you? Shut up! Bro, only God can save us now. It's him?! Bro, we robbed money from him at the Bank. Careful... He’s Mukthi Channel’s Program Head. - God bless you! He's here with some problem. Your visit here is auspicious. Catching a glimpse of the Saint gives you joy. We learned about the Saint from Lawyer Ravi. - No one comes here on someone's reference. You can come only if Saint determines you to. I have a problem, Saint. - I need your blessings. Sudha…! Sudha…! What happened? - Don't panic, son. Saint is extremely powerful. She couldn't resist his power. Sudha...! Is anyone a doctor here? Sudha…! - Don't panic. Doctor, what happened to her? She’s pregnant. - Really? Saint...! My wife got pregnant as we are in your auspicious presence. This is your miracle. It's the glory of your blessings. I've been to every hospital and temple there is since marriage. I've used both English medicine and herbal. Saint, you're my God. No. You are God for all of us. You are our God, Saint. Guys, are you out of your minds? Have you lost it? He's a Saint who performs miracles and solves our hardships. How could you trap him in a closed space? Saint… Everyone should get to witness your miracles. Everyone...! I know what to do. Coming Friday, I'll arrange your LIVE telecast from 5 to 6 pm on my channel. I'll state your miracles to both the States. Bothering me already? I’m not the CM yet. Why are you in a hurry? There's still time. I wish that old man passed away. Call me once he does. I'm with you. I'll take care. Yeah. Party members... They've been calling for Corporation and Ministry. It's been really chaotic. What's the matter? I told you about the Saint, remember? We arranged a Press meet on Friday. I would like for you to come. - Why wouldn't I come? Why would a politician skip a Press meet? I'll be there. By the way, Sundaram's site... The site we were planning to build a hotel in... I have got all the permission papers. You just have to take a call. Leave that to me, brother. After the Press meet, we can build 10 such hotels. You think so? All right. When is the Press meet? Friday at 5pm… - I'll be there, Bhavani. Go touch his feet. Bro, listen to me. - You recently had a fight. She looks really angry with you. Go...! Saint…! Saint…! Saint…! You have to save me. Saint, you're my only hope. Only you can save me. Or else, I have no other resort but to die. Who are you? - I'm Prakasham, Saint. I've been into all kinds of business. Nothing worked out. I've faced failure several times in life. Everyone left me alone, Saint. Including my wife and kids... I'm on the streets with no medium to earn a living. You have to show me a way, Saint. Prakasham… - Sir... Your name means lustre. But your life is filled with darkness. Don't worry. You're here because Saint has showered mercy already. Don't be in despair. Stay here and find some work until you settle down. You'll always have the Saint's blessings. Thank you, Saint. This is what I wanted to hear. China Babu... Master... He looks educated. Employ him for the trust work. - Ok. Thank you, Saint. - Go on, son... Saint… Go... Vasu... Stay away from me and talk. I feel disgusted when you come any closer. Damn! What kind of a life is yours? Being a thief and a Saint in disguise… Why are you still alive? Death is far better compared to this. ‘Why are you still alive? Death is far better compared to this.' I'm a thief but I really loved you. If I hadn't met you... I'd assume world is filled with sorrow alone. I thought only money could make me happy. But after I saw you at the temple... I totally forgot about it. While I was running away with the money... I saw you and stayed back. I don't know any other form of love. This is all love, right? I wonder. First time I saw you, you were robbing a God's idol. And now, you're in the disguise of a Saint. I don't understand how I can trust you. Love is all about trust, right? What can I do for you to trust me? - You should seem true to me. True, you mean? These are proof enough to expose Saint Krishnananda. Do something. He has arranged a Press meet at 5 pm on Friday. Come to the hermitage by 4:30 with all the evidences. That day, Saint Krishnananda shall be exposed And people shall talk about every other fake Saint out there. With this, any man should pee his pants to claim he's a Saint. Vasu, come fast. We have to go upstairs. - It's just a Press meet. Saint will be seen on TV for the first time. Let's go. Mom...! Come on... Has the Press meet started? - It'll start at 5. You start from home. I'll be 10 minutes late. They'd think I'm jobless if a Minister's on time. Sir, tell me. Where are you, Rohit? - I'm downstairs. All our men are here. Good. Come upstairs in 10 minutes. - Okay, sir. Are the police here? They just came, sir. - Ask them to come up at 5:30. Okay, sir. My greetings to all the devotees and viewers of Mukthi TV. It's a divine day today. A memorable day for the viewers and our channel... Because, we aren't introducing an ordinary man today. We are introducing to you a manifestation of God. It's our channel's fortune to be able to do so. Sri Gurumurthy will speak a few words about this mystic. Hope mankind finds bliss. Gods manifests in every time period. When sins take over the world... For punishing the evil and establishing ordinance... Lord Krishna said he’d manifest on Earth. Did he? He didn’t. He neither took birth as a human nor manifested as God. But as a messenger of God, Saint Krishnananda has visited us from Dwaraka. Hail, Saint Krishnananda! Hail, Saint Krishnananda! Hey, I’m on my way. - Okay. The Minister will also be here. Let’s send all of them to jail together. - Okay, sir. Greetings, everyone... What can I tell you about my God? I was really dumb when I came to Hyderabad. Because of God’s grace and Saint’s mercy... I’m here talking to you. He is Lord Krishna himself who manifested for me. Hail, Saint Krishnananda! Trust member, Lawyer Ravi will speak now. In the country, court is punishing the accused. But the crime rate doesn’t seem to descend. Why is that? It’s because man doesn’t fear the court and verdict anymore. He manifested as Saint Krishnananda to bring a change in mankind. Hail, Saint Krishnananda! Minister will be here in 10 minutes. Wait... Where are the police? - They’re downstairs, sir. Ask them to come up urgently. - Okay, sir. Greetings, everyone... Unlike everyone here claimed, I’m not a great personality. I’m not a powerful God either. I’ma thief. What?! Did the Saint announce he’s a thief? Hey, stop the car! Stop the car, I say! A person wanted the truth from me. Here I am telling everyone. I have concealed two truths only. One... It’s my love. Two... I’m a thief. People didn’t come out in the open saying they’ve been betrayed. There were no secret cameras involved. No atheist groups have attacked him. For the first time in the history of 2 States... Announcing he’s not a God but a fraud in a peaceful Press meet... Saint Krishnananda has created a sensation. He is our Focus Point for the day. He disguised himself as a Saint on the terrace of an apartment earlier. He announced he’s a thief in his hermitage ‘Dwaraka’. And said he has to reveal the truth for a person. ‘I have concealed two truths only.’ ‘One... It’s my love.’ ‘Two... I’m a thief.’ My husband will be fine, right? - We can’t be sure until 24 hours pass. Oh, my God! My dear... You said the Saint came to eliminate our sorrows. Now you’re bed ridden with BP and diabetes. I hope the Saint’s life is destroyed. May his arms and legs be paralyzed. Get lost, waste fellow! Sir, what happened? You called a roadside romeo a God. The channel has been degraded. With the Chairman yelling at me… I’m pissing blood in my pants. No, sir. My wife got pregnant once we met him. She got pregnant because of you. Not him. That’s true, sir. - You ruined the channel’s goodwill. Sponsors are compelling me to cancel their ads. Try to understand, sir. Please... - Get out! Even alcohol isn’t working. What else can I drink? ‘I have concealed two truths only.’ ‘I’m a thief.’ Whoa, Erra Srinu! What have you done, man? Didn’t I tell you already? You’ll be screwed if you mess with women. Have you listened to me? No. Look what happened now. Look... Eat this first. He’s not going anywhere. He’ll come back. He hasn’t been in senses since this happened. After realizing Saint Krishnananda is also a fraud... Devotees are in deep shock. Switch off the TV first. Where were you since last night? When God himself had betrayed me… None of my actions matter anymore. Either he or I should die today. - Hey, Giri...! Stop! He’s dead in my hands. - What the hell are you doing? Stop! Stop right now! I’ll turn into ashes. Matchsticks... Don’t stop me. What the hell are you doing? Take him inside. Come, dear... Decide on something. Hey, man! What’s the matter with you? I was coming to you the other day. You know the mess Media has created. CM called meanwhile. I had to meet him. I didn’t have time to get back to you. What’s your problem now? Make the Media shut up. - How do you suppose I do that? It’s the Media. I’m a Minister. I’ll be screwed if I mess with them. Have you forgotten? Only because I argued 15 cases of yours and gave a clean sheet... You became the Minister. Hey... I’ve always wanted to have an affair with a hot auntie. I pardoned that desire as I can’t take her torture. Now, you’re filling in that space. Okay. What’s your final word? What can I say? Listen to me. Make sure Media doesn’t get hold of the three guys. I’ll make sure our names aren’t revealed. Okay? Hmm... That’s better. Hey, switch the siren on. [PHONE BUZZING] Hello... What’s the scene? Same situation since yesterday… But the Media is going frenzy here. They’re way too excited for a cover story. Where are the guys? They’re with me. Ambulance will be there in 30 minutes. Get them into the ambulance. Not just the Media... No one will ever see them again. Bro… - Do as I say. Bro, Police caught us several times but the Media, never. He’s destroying our career. We wouldn’t be in trouble even if we stole the Nizam jewels. I long told you this wouldn’t work out. You didn’t care. Look what happened now. If you think of the consequences and proceed…It’s not love, man. Sujatha, the situation at fake Saint Krishnananda’s hermitage is really chaotic. Media is trying to unravel the mystery but some goons are in the way. Going by the scenario, there must be some really big shots behind this. For more LIVE updates, tune in to Sakshi TV. Who else has joined hands with fake Saint Krishnananda including you? Manipulating the devotion of innocent people, you looted millions, didn’t you? What are the reasons the Saint has exposed himself? Is there any political pressure that made him confess? Rumors suggest the Saint fled to America with his secrets revealed. The Saint, who is on the run... Did he try to contact you? I have answers to all the questions you posed. In that case, why aren’t you letting us in? ‘There’s no better teacher than truth.’ Along with the curiosity to question... You should have the interest to listen. Please come... This is the testing period. Even Lord Rama had to test Goddess Sita. It doesn't mean Goddess Sita is mistaken. It also doesn't mean Lord Rama has sinned. If you found out Lord Rama's intention behind testing Goddess Sita's fidelity... You wouldn't be so confused. What's that intention? Why don't you tell us? Lord Krishna would steal pots of cheese when he was little. He wasn't called a thief for that. He was given cute nicknames instead. Everything God does has a meaning and purpose to it. We misunderstand everything and arrive at wrong conclusions. Lord Rama's intention behind testing Goddess Sita's fidelity... It was to state her greatness to the world. It's for her loyalty to be taken as inspiration. Similarly, Little Krishna didn't steal cheese for nothing. He indirectly meant for us to steal people's hearts. That's the essence of love. Forget that, sir. Tell us why Saint Krishnananda called himself a thief. Like I told you before, this is the testing period. Why is an exam held at the end of a year's education? It is to qualify to the next grade if you pass. And remain in the same grade if you fail. Similarly, this was Saint's test to differentiate his true devotees from the false. Brother... This was a test Saint held to eliminate the fake ones. I knew it. My God wouldn't cheat me. Realizing Saint Krishnananda is not a fraud... And that it was his test to identify his true devotees... People are experiencing sheer joy. Claiming they have passed this test of the Saint... His devotees are expressing their happiness. O' Saint... You're the savior of us all. You're the God who saved my husband. Thank you, sir. Your promotion letter… - Thank you very much, sir. Congrats, sir. - Thank you, brothers. Sir... Sir... I knew you were talented. - Thank you, sir. Like God has tested his devotees… I tested you as well. Sorry if I hurt you. - Don't say that, sir. Congratulations, my boy! Hail, Saint Krishnananda! This seems to be a drama of some kind, sir. He calls himself a thief. But this one claims he is not. Media and the people have found their pass time. This must be a publicity strategy. So, even God has his own marketing team. When he confessed he was a thief... The density in his voice and honesty in his eyes confused me. He's a great actor whose lie sounded as true as the reality. Do something. The lawyer, police and the politician on the stage... Gather their complete bio-data. - Okay, sir. One more thing... The man working his charm with words… The priest with the head gear... I want his complete history as well. - Sure, sir. I'll stay in the hermitage and expose the Saint. What the hell! What crap were you blabbering on the mic? You homeless idiots! Now that you got a place and food, you've become arrogant. A person asked you to reveal the truth, eh? Who's that person? I'm asking you. Hey! I could kill you right now and no one would know. Tell me who the person is. - Who else, sir? The priest told him. You can ask China Babu if you're doubtful. Yeah, bro. Didn't I tell you he's a mental case? What is this, sir? He asks us to tell the truth. You threaten to kill us when we do. Our heads are blasting from the indecisiveness. Just kill us, sir. We can't lead this crappy life anymore. Bloody life! We'll not stay here. It's far better in the outside world. We can booze in peace whenever we’re sad. What do we have here except incense sticks? We can neither smoke nor drink. Just kill us, sir. Go ahead. You'll have all this stuff in your bedroom from today. Go... Hmm... Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. Hey, don't listen to anything the priest says anymore. Okay, sir. - Sure, sir. Bro... This maniac must have been crazy but our hermitage became quite famous. 5 million... 5 million... We'd have been happily settled in Dubai by now. You talked about losing your mind and telling the truth. You've been acting crazy lately. Hey, don't say a word to him. We've grown up together since we were kids. Shut up, you idiot! What’s wrong with you? Look how he's smiling. They’re not ordinary people. They’ll kill us straight. Did you have to announce we are thieves? Hey, he didn't have to say it. We were born looking like thieves. He didn't have to arrange a Press meet. You're also right from one angle. What’s wrong now? Look over there. Oh… You’re here finally. Please come, ma'am... Please come... You have great timing, girl. You're stuck in his mind. Look how he's smiling at you. Do something. Why don't you kill him? Kill us as well. What have we done to you? She'll not leave our friend alone. Go. Go kill him. Stab him all you want and kill him. Come on, stab him. I don't know who my parents are. I don't even know where I was born. What do I have with me that's true? Except for my love for you... ♪Isn't this surprising?♪ ♪I've fallen for your glance♪ ♪Isn't this shocking?♪ ♪I lost myself to your smile♪ ♪I can't seem to think straight♪ ♪Love is luring me toward you♪ ♪I see no way to resist this♪ ♪Isn't this surprising?♪ ♪I've fallen for your glance♪ ♪Sleep flees away from my eyes♪ ♪Life has turned out to be exciting♪ ♪Heart begins to feel a quiver♪ ♪Words don't reach out to you♪ ♪O' God, why are you so angry with me?♪ ♪Give me the strength to express my love♪ ♪I can't hold this in even for a moment♪ ♪No matter what, I'll pour my heart out♪ ♪Isn't this surprising?♪ ♪I've fallen for your glance♪ ♪Beauty pokes me smoothly♪ ♪Heart feels mesmerized♪ ♪Love in me is awakened♪ ♪I wonder if I'm going insane♪ ♪Footsteps don't seem to fall back♪ ♪Distance doesn't stand a chance♪ ♪No matter which path leads to him♪ ♪I'll not rest until I fall into his arms♪ ♪Isn't this surprising?♪ ♪I've fallen for your glance♪ ♪Isn't this shocking?♪ ♪I lost myself to your smile♪ Bro, it’s good times for us. - Really? You’ll definitely be an MLA. - Do you think so? The fare is 300 rupees, ma’am. - What? Why don't you take 3000? Do you think I’m innocent? You think money blooms on the trees? Bro… Bro… Sister-in-law is here. Did you tell her I’m upstairs? - He doesn't have to tell me. Don't I know what you're up to? Uma, listen to me. - Whoa! Have you opened a party office here? This is not a party office. - How long will you chase after a post? When we got married, I was told you have a lot of wealth. Where’s all of it? - Uma... I’ve got no gold except for my sweetheart. - Uma, please forget all of that. The Saint is right there. There he is. Fold your hands in prayer. O' Saint... Please forgive me. I saw all the crowd and assumed he's showing off. You really seem like God to me. You have to help him lose his greed for power... And make him realize the value of love. I thought he'd change after having a kid. I stayed away for a while for him to change. You are my only hope as of now. Unless you change him, I can't go home to him. Krishnananda Trust has a deposit of 80 million, sir. But not a single transaction has been made. Something's wrong. I sense something fishy. Even with a single transaction, we can find their motive. We can arrest everyone with that proof. So, do you have the account form? - Yes, sir. Can I just see it, please? Nominee: Vasudha... Who's this Vasudha, sir? I don't know who that is, sir. As they opened an account hurriedly, I didn't ask for details. Hey! Hey... Stop... Don't move. What? What are you doing? Take your hand off. Take your hand off! What are you up to? Let go. What a life, man! I wish it froze this very moment. I asked her to get flowers. Where’d she go? - That's my mom! Vasu… - Come here. Vasu… - Sit down. Where’s sister? Where'd you see her? I saw her, auntie. She was right here. Vasu... Vasu... She's not here. Let's go look downstairs. What? I just want to be with you. I feel I don't want anything else. That's not possible. I’ve been here for 21 days now. - So what? I’m going back home tomorrow. - Are you going? Yeah. - Already? [PHONE BUZZING] Hello... Bro, he has fooled all of us. He's in love with a girl at the hermitage. Who's she? Some electrician's daughter... Where is he? Hey! Why’d you come here? - What do you want me to do? You said you're leaving. How can I meet you otherwise? - Okay, tell me what it is. Now that I'm home, send me back with something. What do you want me to give? You've cast some spell on me. But I'm scared now. Why? Answer my question first. Ask me. Will you marry me? I'll do anything for you. How is that possible? Why? If you're in the disguise of a Saint, my dad will not agree. What do you want me to do? Quit all of this for me and be an ordinary man. Wouldn't you marry me if I didn't change? You'll change for me. I know. What’s with him, man? I thought he wanted to stay back. Have you lost your mind? - Hey, We’ll be in trouble if we stay any longer. Don't you get it? I’ve had enough of this fake life. I have to get out of here to marry Vasu. Hey! I have more cases on me than I've argued. I know everything. I know all about your dramas in the name of love. What do you want me to do? I'll kill her. Forget her if you want to keep her alive. Hey! Stop, man! How dare he warn us! He doesn't know us. He’ll kill Vasu, eh? Rascal! - He's too drunk. Let's take him upstairs. Get up... I’ll kill him. Vasu, man... Forget it. This is all his stuff, right? Forget about him. Hey! Hey! He'll kill Vasu, eh? Hey, hold it! Hey come! Pull him away. - You'll step on the glass. In the program 'Helping Others' conducted by TV9... A cancer patient is here today for help. This boy is suffering with a rare type of cancer at such a young age. He needs 2.5 million for his treatment. As his parents cannot afford the cure, they are looking for donors. If anyone of you wish to aid the boy financially and save his life... Please call the number below. Where's my phone? Hello... Hey, where's he at? Right here... You think it’s your dad’s wealth? - Is it your dad's? Hey! - Hey! I've seen enough. I stayed back for Vasudha. If you take away what I want… I'll take away what you want. How dare you answer back? - Hush! Shut up and listen to me. I'm not a thief anymore. I'm God. Whatever I say comes true. Want to see? Tell me, ma’am. - Saint, We've been to every hospital and temple there is. No one cared to help us. But you helped us on time. You're our God. Please don't mention it. Saint, are you donating the 2.5 million right now? Don't question our Saint's solemn vow. Lord Rama's arrow and Saint's word aren't taken back once they're out. Lawyer, stop looking around and write them a cheque. Go... Lawyer, you've studied Law and pardoned our traditions. Place the cheque at Saint's feet, fold your hands in prayer and hand it over to them. I want Vasudha. Search, guys! Search the entire house! How long have you been doing this for? - Hey, who are you? Take your hand off. Seems you’re running a brothel here. We received a complaint. Sir, you’ve got the wrong information. - Hey! Take your hands off my daughter. Hey! You've left your daughter to her will. She is so full of it now. She's sleeping with the Saint. Hey! Shut up! Let go of her hand. What? Are you angry? Send her to me if she can't resist. Hey, you are an ordinary electrician. Your daughter is messing with the wrong people. You'll be dead. Leave the city before dawn. Or else, you'll be locked up for prostitution. Saint, it's my birthday today. Saint, it's Eesha's birthday today. We wanted to have prayers performed here. - Sure, ma'am. You're fortunate to have it performed in Saint's presence. Mom, I'll give the offering to everyone. Hmm... Sure. Remember what we told you? Move aside, people. Give way. No, dear. Why? He can't eat anything yet. [CHANTING] Saint, we could just give him birth. But you brought life into him. He is alive because of your blessings. You're God for real. I got drunk and gave them the money. And they call me God. Forget about it. You forget me. What? My wedding is fixed. What are you talking about? - My wedding is in 10 days. You are only getting married to me. - That's not possible. Why? I told you. That’s all. - Tell me why. Hey! We've planned our future around him. Meet him tomorrow and tell him. Ask him to forget you. Decide between your love and his life. Or else, he'll be dead. There's no way he can kill me. I'll make him convince your dad and arrange our wedding. [PHONES BUZZING] Hey, what’s happening? - One minute... Even I don't know, sir. Saint called urgently and asked me to arrange a LIVE telecast in all the channels. LIVE telecast, huh? - Hello... Think about it. It might be risky. - Why don't you give it a thought? What's all this? We have 80 million in the Trust. Hmm... You threatened her, remember? Oh... Apologize to her father, convince him, have me married to Vasu and out of here. You'll have the money to yourself. Don't you wish to live? Do as I say. Or else, not a single penny will be left. Ready... Me and my Trust members have just reached a decision. On behalf of the Krishnananda Trust... All the kids in the State will be provided free education, basic necessities and clothes. For those who have no family in the State... I'm with you. Bro, it's LIVE. Whatever you do will create chaos. Saint Krishnananda who earned great trust among people in a short span... Has taken up service programs on behalf of his Trust. Through welfare schemes like free education and healthcare for orphans... He's helping the society on his part. Meanwhile, Saint's helping hand has reached millions. He has decided to provide free healthcare, medicines and wheelchairs to the elderly. Bro...! Bro...! Hey! Switch the TV on. He has already donated 40 million. If we stay mum, he'll donate the remaining 40 million as well. Do something. Do something, brother. Come on... He dared to warn me, huh? Bloody roadside bugger! I'll kill him and build his grave. Hey! We'll earn more money and lose nothing. Bro, think about it again. Please... Listen to me. - Let me talk to him. Some cheapster dared to warn Ravi. No, bro. Don't do it. Ravi... Listen... [PHONE BUZZING] Hello. Sir, this is GMR company's Manager speaking. Our MD have noticed your Trust's services. He asked us to donate 50 million to your Trust on our behalf. We'll come to your hermitage tomorrow and hand over the cheque. Hello... This is Srujana Industries' MD speaking. Is it Krishnananda Trust? I'm calling from Shilpa and Shilpa Constructions. Hello... I'm speaking from Karuna Motors. Is it Mr. Ravi? Look... Because of your crazy stunt, we got 2.5 billion in a day. Let's see you get out of this now. Hey! More than you, me and God... Do you know what's powerful? Money... There's more kick in the money people pay God for their sins. He cannot step out at any cost. And the girl can't get in no matter what. I should know who all are visiting him. Everything should be recorded in the CCTV cameras. Bro, Minister is here. Greetings... Greetings... Greetings, Saint! CM have witnessed all your services on TV. He has allotted 10 acres land in Shamshabad for Krishnananda Trust. Here are the documents. He wanted me to show you the documents. He also promised to bear the construction expenses for the Trust. Bless these and I'll take them to the CM. I feel blessed. I'll take leave, Saint. Bhavani, are you happy now? Superb! I put in a lot of effort to convince the CM. One more thing... Our MPs and MLAs are struggling to hide their black money. Huh? Huh... The money sanctioned for Government schemes... It's lying in billions in storage units. There's no accountability to it. Let's save all of that in our Trust. We can share it later. Sure, brother. We have to be out of here urgently. What?! I can't begin to understand what happens if we stay any longer. I have to talk to Vasu. You see the security outside. It's more than what we have at the Pakistan-India border. Do something, guys. -But how? [DOOR KNOCK] Pardon us. You came into our lives unexpectedly and offered us a lot. But my wife has a small desire. It's Krishnashtami tomorrow. It's your day. She wishes to arrange special prayers for you. Please don't deny this one wish of ours. We were just thinking of it and here you are. Saint wants only women to attend tomorrow's prayer. With your blessings, we'll do that for sure. What’d you just do? Vasudha will come tomorrow. But how? He called me and told me everything. I suffered my whole life seeking such love. My husband doesn't have love for his wife and kids like he does for power. You found a man who loves you crazily. Don't let him go. It's Krishnashtami tomorrow. Only women are allowed to come as he wants to meet you. When you look back at life after a few years... You shouldn't regret not doing this. Go... ♪Hail, Nanda Gopala Hari!♪ ♪Hail, Nanda Gopala Hari!♪ ♪Hail, Nanda Gopala Hari!♪ ♪Hail, Nanda Gopala Hari!♪ Hey, take your burkha off. - Who do you think it is. It’s Mr. China Babu’s wife. - You go, ma'am. ♪Hail, Nanda Gopala Hari!♪ ♪Hail, Nanda Gopala Hari!♪ ♪Playing flute melodiously from afar Descend on Earth for us, Krishna♪ ♪Witness our cascading love for you♪ ♪Accept our celebrations of welcome♪ ♪Here's Dwaraka lustring in your presence♪ ♪Hail, Nanda Gopala Hari!♪ ♪Hail, Nanda Gopala Hari!♪ ♪Hail, Nanda Gopala Hari!♪ ♪Hail, Nanda Gopala Hari!♪ ♪Realising you are no illusion I dedicate my life to you, Krishna♪ ♪Hoping you’d eliminate our pain With a soothing tune on the flute♪ ♪Knotting two souls is a mystical game of yours♪ ♪Everyone is led to your path ultimately♪ ♪You're eternal woe and also a sweet lullaby♪ ♪Let your clinking anklets echo in our hearts♪ ♪Hail, Nanda Gopala Hari!♪ ♪Hail, Nanda Gopala Hari!♪ ♪Hail, Nanda Gopala Hari!♪ ♪Hail, Nanda Gopala Hari!♪ I'm here. What shall we do? Trust me. No, thanks. Enough... Hey, why is she here? Why'd you bring her to our place? If Ravi gets to know this, he'll kill us both. You sinner! You're neither a good husband nor an idle father. Why don't you try to be human? Parents’ sins reflect on their kids. You can't learn to love your wife and kids. You're the reason behind all the drama. Don't separate lovers and sin once again. Why do we care about strangers? Why do we care? You didn’t save your wealth for him anyways. Don't try saving your sins for him. Think about this if you want us to be alive. I've been behind power since 15 years, losing everything. But she ultimately won me over with love. I'll take care of everything here. You guys go lead a happy life. Dad! Vasu, let's go. Uncle... Uncle, please... Vasudha is my life. I'd look after her better than you. Vasu! Let's go. Uncle, please listen to me. Let's not talk here. Let's go out. I know what happens once we step out. - Uncle, please listen to me. Eesha... Saint, please save Eesha. Please save Eesha. I'm begging you. Eesha had a hole in his heart since he was born. That is why we never let him step out. We've been in the hospital all night. Doctors said he will not live. You have to do something and save him. Saint, I'm pleading you. Please… Eesha! Eesha, get up! Saint, ask mom not to cry. Tell her I’ll be fine. Tell her, Saint. Tell her. Eesha... Eesha... My boy... Eesha, look at me. Eesha, you'll be fine. Eesha...! Eesha, look at me! Eesha...! My boy...! Eesha...! My boy...! Eesha... ' I heard you are God.' Do something, Saint. Enough, man! Let's get out of here. Wondering who I am? You manipulate people in the name of God. I'm a rationalist who came here to expose you. I'm Chaitanya. After I enquired about you, I realized you aren't here to betray anyone. But you know what the problem is? Once you leave, they'll build your grave and run a business in your name. Why are you telling me this? Let me go. I can't do this. You can do this. Only you can do this. You have to live up to the trust devotees imbibed in you. Because they believed in me, Eesha died in my hands today. You're not the reason for Eesha's death. But the reason the cancer patient lived is definitely you. I did all of that for this girl right here. I had a hope in life after I met her. After seeing Eesha, I learned what happiness is. When I don't have either of them... Where I am really doesn't matter. Earlier, when I'd booze heavily and doze off... I'd assume I'm alive if I wake up. In case I don't, it means I'm dead. But after having met them... I don't have the strength to endure their absence, sir. Sir, he has done all of this for your daughter's love. Even your daughter loves him. Why don't you ask her? Tell him, dear. Please understand their love with a kind heart. My daughter loves me to death. Knowing she decided to elope with him without my notice... I can understand how much she loves him. But he isn’t an ordinary man now. He's God. Millions of people love him. The day they realise her love for him... They'll either kill my daughter or him. Forget about it. If he wasn't God, I wouldn't have any issue. That's all. Been 20 years since I drank alcohol. I quit drinking as I made a promise to my Gita before 20 years. She broke her promise and left me behind. But her love for me is eternal in her memories. Cheers! Cheers to those who look up to you as God. Cheers to them, yeah. Gita would always tell me. Nothing in the world is greater than love. I wouldn't believe her. You know I'm a rationalist. I'd look for logic. After she left, I realized love is magical beyond any logic. I missed it, Srinu. I couldn't shower a teensy bit of love on Gita. I saw the same love in your eyes for Vasudha. That same old bloody logic less magic called love. That is why I say you and Gita are great. So great that all these billions of money was nothing for you. With no fear of life, you announced to the world that you were a thief. That is why I say your insanity is great. After seeing you, I understood who God is. - I'm not God, sir. Hey, fool! God is not a mere idol or a photograph. They're just beliefs. God either exists or doesn't according to what we believe. But the trust millions of people imbibed in you... That's godly. Your pure love and honesty that only love can supersede... That's godly. In my words, atheism preached a man should help his fellow being. Theism preaches the man who helps is God. Every religion reaches the same conclusion. 'Live an honest life and help others while you can.' Am I right? I'm not in a position to help anyone, sir. I myself am in trouble. It's okay. He who stands for justice and ordinance always gets into trouble. You don't know the value of cool breeze unless you sweat. You don't know the value of life unless you fight. Earlier, you'd only think for yourself. And now, you're weeping as you couldn't save Eesha. Yes or no? His disease was not as sympathetic as you are. Many kids are suffering from such diseases, Srinu. You have to help thousands of such kids in the world. Me? Yeah. People are crazy, man. They believe whatever you say. They're always dependent on someone to save them. What do you want me to do now? As people made you God, spend their 20 billion on them. Win the trust of those seeking your help. I'll make you human and help win your love. Yes! What's all this, sir? This is called 3-D hologram. Fix the camera. Come stand in the centre. Come... Yeah, just a minute. Oh, fish! - Sir, what is this? You made a photocopy of him. Looks like Aishwarya Rai's dance from the movie Jeans. Something like that. Mr. Narendra Modi also used this 3-D technology. Giving an illusion of our presence using the real image... But, why do we need this, sir? In the land Government allotted for the hermitage... I'm planning the inauguration on the coming 24th. Thousands of your devotees will be there for your speech. I'm arranging a room under the stage. So, you'll be in the room and through the 3-D hologram... You'll announce the donation of 20 billion in the Trust to people... And then disappear. What do you mean disappear? -Literally disappear... He’ll vanish while everyone is watching. - What are you saying, sir? Let me show you. Sir... What about Vasudha? You do what you have to do for the people. I'll make sure your love wins. Your speech is in here. Prepare for it. There’s no bigger God than trust. And no bigger strength than determination. You have them both now. All the best. You asked for a land. I got it for you. You say you’ll inaugurate on the coming 24th. - I'll be there. What else? I did everything you asked for. If you come, you represent your party alone. But if the CM came... National Media will cover the event. We made 20 billion being famous in the State alone. Once we are famous across the country… Do you know how much we can make? I was told a Minister shouldn’t be so smart. I didn't learn much of Math. 100 billion... We hit the jackpot. Would CM come for real? You doubt it? We have 54 MLAs supporting me. I assure you to bring the CM. You make the plan work out. You invite the CM. We'll have a star hotel in every city in India. If everything works out, you can be the next CM. Hmm... CM is coming. That's it. You don't have to tell me anything. I know everything. It's been days Minister Raghu's scams reached my table. I ordered the CBI for a silent investigation. He'll be behind the bars soon. Sir, one thing... Please think about the criminal lawyer batch in the Trust. Everyone gets their time. But you're doing a really good thing. I’ll give my best to help you take the money to people. Okay? Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. So, how’s it going, sir? How are you doing? You haven't changed a bit, Chaitanya. Sir... Even when you worked for IAS, you'd mention people first and then came personals. Well, in fact, I was a little upset when you quit the job. But, what you're doing right now is the correct service. Thanks again, sir. But it's not my greatness, sir. I can't believe politicians like you still exist. I do exist. Believe it. Damn, I didn't mean that, sir. Just analyzing, that's all. When is the inauguration? It's on the coming 24th, sir. 24th... Good. I'll be there. Let's settle everyone's accounts over there. Thank you, sir. I'll take your leave. All the best. - Excuse me, sir. Hey! I spare no one interrupting my thought. How dare you interrupt my dream? Trying to make him human on the 24th, eh? I'll make him a dead body on the 24th itself. He'll forever be God. What I'm trying to tell all the Krishnananda devotees is... In the 10 acres land Government sanctioned us... We are building shopping malls, liquor malls and cinema theatres. You don’t have to pay. It's free for all the devotees. I'm sorry, man. I'm leaving before I could stand up to my promise. They found out about our plan. God means boundless love, eternal trust and everlasting faith. Hey... Chaitanya sir sent you an MMS. 'I'm leaving before I could stand up to my promise.' 'They found out about our plan.' 'But the money should reach people no matter what.' 'Both their trust and my ambition are in your hands.' 'Stand up to their trust.' 'You're not the reason for Eesha's death.' 'But the reason the cancer patient lived is definitely you.' 'You have to help thousands of such kids in the world.' 'Consider it their need or dependence.' ‘They only know to plead. But you know to save.' 'You have to live up to the trust devotees imbibed in you.' He has passed on the message, I see. Don’t come in my way if you want to be alive. I don't care even if I lose my life. I'll not let you take a single penny. All this money should reach people. Hey, I grew up playing with pimps like you in jail and court. Playing games with me, huh? Even if I die, you can never be human. You'll remain God. ' You'll remain God.' How much is the money? 20 billion, sir... 20 billion? It's quite a huge sum. If the opposition gets hold of it... 10 MLAs from our party will shift to theirs. We shouldn’t waste that money. Nowadays, money is everything. He can do anything at any point of time. You do something. Do you know what you’re doing? - I'm doing everything with my knowledge. Do you know what the consequences are? You'll have to remain God forever then. It's okay if I have to. But the money should reach people, got it? - No, listen... Why don't you tell him? Vasu... I told you things about love and life. It was all true. But Mr. Chaitanya gave me a much important task. He sacrificed his life to stand by his duty. I feel our love is a petty issue comparatively. You're right, uncle. I can never be your son-in-law. I wanted to give it once we're married. Greetings, everyone! I was born just like you did. I was selfish, hoping for a better life for myself. But love made me human. A belied made me God. A responsibility brought me to you. A God told me God is not about miracles, chants and charms. He told me every human loving another unconditionally is God. He said love itself is God. If accepting is being selfish… He told me giving is godly. He told me why I was born. He left telling me what my purpose is. Yes, I've seen God. We says kids are equal to God. So, we're building a hospital with the 20 billion in Krishnananda Trust. Thousands of kids are dying every year due to illnesses. We provide free healthcare to all of them. From now on, no kid shall die due to lack of treatment. This is why I was born. Manifestation of Lord Krishna in the modern age... Saint Krishnananda has been shot. While he announced a hospital for kids using the 20 billion... This tragedy has occurred. Greetings, sir… - Greetings... How do you feel? I feel all right, sir. He only shot you. I only had him do it. Nothing wrong. Chaitanya promised you, remember? He promised to make you human once you give people the money. I promised him to help you in all contexts. That is why I did it. You don’t have to worry. I'll take care of everything. You did what you had to. The Trust and money will be of service to people. You've become human from a godly form. Go… Go enjoy your love and life. All the best! Doctor, you do something. Sir, how is the Saint feeling? Doctors haven’t given us clear information. - What's the situation? Doctors have tried their best. It's unfortunate. Saint has left us physically. Lord Krishna preached about death being inevitable. Even he had to face death having taken human form. Saint will shower his blessings on us forever. Saint preached about helping a fellow human as the essence of humanity. Let's share his message and ambition with the world. This Trust is for the people. It's for their wellness. It'll be under the Government's control. Government will l look after all the proceedings. Hope mankind finds bliss. Devotees in both the States are grief stricken. CM said Saint has left us physically but he'd shower his blessings forever... And that we need to share his message with the world. Thank you, sir. - What for? You said you'd give me a clean sheet if I shot him. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. We checked the CCTV footage at the Press Club. He only murdered the Saint. What do you do with a murderer? - We arrest him once you permit us. Once you have the evidence, don't let a criminal go even if the CM stops you. Take him. - Okay, sir. Sir! For establishing ordinance, I had to do it. I had to employ the evil. Go... Sir... Sir... C...U...M... B... E... R... Cucumber... Bro, what's a cucumber? Damn! How’d you think of coming to UK with me? - In a flight... It’s a comb. - A comb? I don't think so. It’s a comb if women use it. It's a cucumber if men use it. You don't even know that. Everyone must learn English, man. Yeah, absolutely right. Hey… - Yeah? Make it fast. Kids must be hungry. - We look so cheap to her, man. Aren't we kids, bro? As per Chaitanya's promise... Erra Srinu led a human life. He married Vasudha, started an honest life away from the State and settled happily. Filling in the space of her son, he looks after Chaitanya's mom like his own. Builder Sathi Babu is staying in the same hermitage to serve people. According to CM’s promise to Erra Srinu… Government is looking after the Trust hospital. Coming to the main character of our story... Gurumurthy... Master... Huh? Greetings... Tell me, son. I'm in love with Shilpa since 3 years. What happened to her? - Nothing happened to her. But Rahul attempted suicide. He's in the same hospital. Who’s Rahul, son? - He's in love with Shilpa. But you said you love her. Both of us are in love with Shilpa. - Whom does Shilpa love? I came to you as I don't know that. What does your heart tell you? My heart tells me Shilpa loves me. But mind says it might work out in Rahul's favour. Follow what your heart tells you. Even I followed what my heart told me in life. I never failed. Are you out of your mind? How could you leave me with him? I warned him I'd kill him if he says he loves me again. Let's go catch a movie. Believe in things. They'll come true. God bless you! [SUBTITLES BY TITLES MEDIA]
