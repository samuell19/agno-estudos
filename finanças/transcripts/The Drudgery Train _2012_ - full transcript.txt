Nice girls. Big boobs. Nice girls. Music by SHINCO Music by SHINCO Come on in. Music by SHINCO Music by SHINCO Directed by Nobuhiro Yamashita Come in. Directed by Nobuhiro Yamashita Directed by Nobuhiro Yamashita Thank you. Kanta Kitamachi. Age 19. His father committed a sex crime that tore up his family in 5th grade. He has worked as a day laborer since graduating junior high. His only hobby is reading books. The Drudgery Train (Kueki Ressha) Hey. Where are we going? Probably to Shibaura. I see. Mind if I join you? Have you worked here for a long time? Yeah. But not every day. Are you in university? No, I'm not. What about you? Are you in university? I go to a vocational school. I just started this year. This year? Then you were in high school until this spring? Were you born in 1967? 1968. But my birthday's in February. Then we're in the same grade. Are you from Tokyo? Which ward? No, I was born and raised in Kyushu. I just came to Tokyo in March. It's your first day on the job but you don't seem tired. Are you used to physical labor? No, I'm totally exhausted. What are those bags, anyway? Around 10 am I considered telling them that I've had it and just leaving. Another sake. What are you doing? Nothing. He got in the way, that asshole. Kanta Kitamachi. OK. Hey! Hey. You came again. Yeah, I came. I'm sore, though. You will be at first. You're not sore at all? That's awesome. I've gotten used to it. That's awesome. Want it? Thanks. Swim team, huh? Sounds great. It must feel good to swim in cold water on a hot day. What about you? What did you do in high school? I never went to high school. I've been working by the day since graduating junior high. That's so cool. Don't be stupid. It's a miserable life. Of course not. Oh, show me the ropes sometime. You plan on staying here that long? Not sure yet, but I'll come tomorrow at least. And probably for a while after that. Do you have a girlfriend? No. I just moved out here. Aren't there lots of girls in school? Only ugly ones. No good at all. Do you have a girlfriend? No. I used to, though. An ugly one like a potato. I used to practice sex on her a lot, but she was disgusting. She stank down there so I never went down on her. That's nasty. There's a girl I'm interested in now, and she's really cute. She's the best! She probably smells great down there. I'll show you sometime. Great. Show me. Yeah, I will. "Please pay a month's worth of rent by tomorrow." When will you pay the rent? It's been four months. 60,000 yen. Ray up now. If you're not paying, then move out right away. I'll pay you next week with the money from my part-time job. Next week, next week... You said that last week. I'll really pay you this time. I mean it. I'm really sorry. My mom's in hospital and I had to send money. I'll really pay next week. It pains me to have to say this to you time and again. I want you to move out. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Then pay up. I will. Idiot. Things don't work out so easy. Hey. Yes? Aren't these mussels? I'm not sure. Like in French cuisine. I don't know. What a great find. I could make a fortune selling these. Don't you think? Hey? Weren't you at Toyomi the other day? Yes. So you work here and there. But you're young so get out before it breaks you. Do you have dreams? No, not really. You don't have any? You're young. Chase a dream. It could be anything. Like becoming a singer. Speaking of singers, I can sing well. I'm such a good singer that I was scouted once. But my woman got pregnant around that same time. So I gave up that dream. But... I was scouted again recently at a karaoke bar. Know why? Because I'm a good singer. So I'm thinking of pursuing my dream in life once again. You guys are still young, so chase your dreams. You hear what I'm saying? Dream on, man. Mussels. See? What the hell? He thinks he's so great. He wants to be a singer? He's just a day laborer. That's so annoying! Never mind. Just ignore such crap. What's this? I'm a regular here. Wow. You read books? Sure. Don't mock my lack of education. I'm not mocking you. I'm impressed. I don't read much at all. I've always read books at least. That's admirable. That's her. What do you think? She's cute. She goes to Hosei University and is our age. She's earning her own tuition. She makes her own lunch and brings it with her to eat. You know a lot about her. Yeah. Anyway, she's really a hard worker. You think she'll let me do her? What are you saying? She looks so soft and attractive. 2 weeks passed. For coming to work continuously, Kanta and Shoji were promoted to assistant warehouseman. You're good, Kusakabe. I've always been good with machines. OK, next. Kitamachi. Don't turn it so much. Go straight! You're pretty skillful. Yeah, it's easy once you get the hang of it. Do you mean I'm too dumb to learn? I didn't say that, did I? I'm just a junior high graduate. Oh, come on. What's Mr. Takahashi doing? Hey! This place is awesome! There are tons of them! He's gathering shells. Are those edible? I guess he's gathering them because they are. Hey guys. A great catch. What will you do? A present for the missus. Mind if I borrow the fridge for now? Hold on, Takahashi. Yes? What are those? Mussels. You idiot! You can't eat shells from that polluted sea! I can't? Even if you heat them thoroughly, they might kill you! Yes. What were you thinking? Close the door. Yes. You're eating more? Why not? Hot food is so good. It's the perk of being a warehouseman. You're right. Good work. We're all day laborers, and yet what a difference. Yeah, man. After our lunch, I could never stand cold food again. How'd we ever work so hard on that? - I know. - Right? Hey. I've been promoted to warehouseman, too. Be nice to me. Be nice, man. We get allowances, right? - So I hear. - How much do we get? - I don't know. - Tell me, man. - Let's go for a drink with it. - Oh, sure. - Let's sing. - Right you are. What did you do with those shells? What happened to your shells yesterday? I was told to toss them so I did. That's too bad, after all that work you did. They were for your wife, right? - Too bad. - Shut up. Don't be such a wiseass. Don't mess with me! He's pissed. You didn't have to say that. But that guy's so irritating. Hey, why don't we go see a movie in Ueno? That actor, what's his name? Oh, Sylvester Stallone. His movie Cobra is good, I hear. A movie? Come on, let's go. It's an action movie so the thrill and excitement will be exhilarating. Well... No, movies aren't really my thing. Let's grab a bite to eat and go home. Oh. Well, all right then, if you say so. Then let's go to a peep show. A peep show? Yeah. I've only heard about them. What, you've never been to one before? It's 2,500 yen, and for an extra 2,000 yen a girl gives you a handjob. If you're gonna do it yourself at home, you might as well go there and get it over with. OK. Let's go. "Peep Shows 'Backstage Girls"' Hey. Let's not do this. I came along because you insisted, but the concept of "peeping" is gross. It's a crime. Don't be ridiculous. Come on. These places are indecent. Indecent? To hell with indecency! They're necessary evils. "Necessary evil" doesn't mean it's OK. You're just evading the truth. I don't care. Stop being so damn uptight. Getting handjobs while watching women masturbate just feels really good. No, I'm saying that the desire to peep in itself is shameful. I've never wanted to... Oh, shut up, man. Stop talking and just come with me. Try it once and you'll be hooked. Here. Excuse me. What are you doing? What? Thank you. Hey, did she let you feel her up? How did that happen? No, nothing like that. I'm just grossed out. But you paid her 2,000 yen, right? You didn't do it yourself. No, she did it for me, but I get this urge to wash my hands after these things. You're weird. Let's go to a massage parlor next week. I know a good place. Bring 30,000 yen with you. Well, if I can make 30,000 yen by then. Yeah. I guess a massage parlor is better than peeping. I'll go so you better take me to a good place. No problem. Ray me back if an old hag shows up. I said no problem. Leave it to me. While you were busy swimming every day, I was busy exploring these things. After all, I've been going to brothels since I was 15. I'd like this, please. Sure. That'll be 150 yen. Hey. Would you be friends with him? Pardon? He wants to be friends with you. Sure. You always come here. I'm Shoji Kusakabe. He's... Kanta Kitamachi, age 19. Yasuko Sakurai, age 19. Are you sure it's OK to be friends? It's okay. All right! All right! What are you doing? Thanks. - C'mon man! - Thanks so much. Stop, this is weird. And 2 servings of dumplings. Are you sure? I'll pay. A token of my gratitude. OK, thanks. I won't hold back, then. Drink. Eat. If she's willing to be friends with me, then she'll give me benefits? I wouldn't be so sure. No, she will. She wouldn't have agreed otherwise. Maybe. She might let me do her. Don't say such things. But I want to do her. She'll be repulsed by that. She said she'd be your friend. So start by being friends. How do I be friends? Don't ask me. So I can't do her? That's much later. What a drag. Then what should I do? Think for yourself. Come on, tell me. Drink all you want. Awesome! Yasuko. Yasuko. My friend, Yasuko. "University must be hard since you make your own lunch and such," "but I'm your friend, Yasuko," "so hang in there." "Yeah." Yasuko. Yasuko. What do you like to read? Seishi Yokomizo. Oh, I like him, too. Gokumon Island is great. I lose track of time when I'm reading. Reading is the only thing I enjoy. Same here. Reading is about the only thing I enjoy. We get along. Yeah. I've never seen this. "Works by Seishi Yokomizo" Too expensive. I have that one. It's pretty good. Really? Good-bye. Kanta. Will you lend me that book? All right. I mean right now. Right now? I want to read it right away. You have it at home, right? Yes I do. Mind if I come with you? I'd like to see your place since we're friends. OK? We're friends, right? You really do like Yokomizo. You can borrow that. Oh, thanks. I'll give it right back. Here you go. Something smells nice. Yeah? I smell soap. Oh, my shampoo, maybe. Oh, yeah. Let's see... I think it was around here... My landlord's grandfather is in the next room. He's bedridden and my landlord just leaves him there. Sometimes... I hear him groaning like that. Oh, here it is. What's he saying? Help... Someone... Hurry... Someone... Hurry... - Help me... - Sir? Sir, are you all right? You want me to get that? Hurry... Hurry... What should I do? Leave him alone. You don't have to do that. Call your landlord. But... Leave him. I can't hold it in much longer... Hurry... Go ahead. It won't stop. Yeah. What's so funny? I thought his pee would overflow back there. My heart was pounding. Do you have a boyfriend? Yes I do. We've been dating since high school. He's older. Right now it's a long-distance relationship, but we talk on the phone every day. Let's shake hands. What's wrong? What are you doing? Just kidding. What? - That's awful. - I was just kidding. It was a joke. Well, I go that way. Yes? Why won't you come? What? You saw the notice telling you to pay rent. I'm sorry, but I've been kind of busy. I couldn't care less. Just move out in two days. What? But it's so sudden. It's not sudden. We've had it with you! We've asked you repeatedly but you never pay. My mother has fallen ill because of you. Move out immediately. If you don't, I'm calling the cops. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Please. Wait until the end of this month. Please. Acting won't do you any good. We've got a contract. Just move out in two days. If you don't, then I'm calling the cops. Got that? So how did it go with Yasuko? I went to her place. We might be dating soon. Hey, that's great. Will you let me crash at your place for a while? What, all of a sudden? Yesterday my landlord's son told me to move out. Why? Well, I haven't paid rent for a while. I see. Anyway, he insists that I leave by tomorrow. So, just for a while, OK? No, that's not possible. My place's only the size of 6 tatami mats. That's more than enough room for me to lie down. No, I've got lots of stuff. And no extra beddings. No sweat. I haven't slept in a futon in 3 years through all seasons. A light blanket is enough. Come on. I'm not just talking about blankets... Hey, Kitamachi. Can't you see you're putting him on the spot? He won't be able to invite girls if you're there. He doesn't have a girlfriend. Don't be unreasonable and go to Sanya if you need a place to stay. You could find places to stay for 500 or 600 yen a night there. Why not just do that? OK? Not that again. Staying at Sanya will solve your problem. Hey, are you telling me to stay at some flophouse, too? I could never stay in those places. That guy was insulting me by suggesting I go there. I seriously considered beating him up. He's just a wretched loser who can only find work like this at his age. He must be just a junior high graduate. But still... Then lend me money. 50,000 yen is enough. Is that enough to rent a place? Sure. For a 12,000 yen 3-mat place I need the deposit, key money, advance rent, and commission, so that'd be 4 month's worth. There are places so cheap? Sure. I've always lived in such places. How much do you pay for rent? You live in Setagaya, right? I pay 60,000 yen a month. What? Then you live in those one-room condos? Not a condo, but there's only one room, yes. It's ridiculously tiny. How's this then? Tell your dad that you need money for rent and lend me the month's worth of money he sends you. You'd be saving my ass. Don't drag my folks into your problem. Oh, all right. 50,000 yen. If you swear you'll pay me back, I'll lend it to you just this once. Really? You saved me! Sorry but I need it right now. Thanks! This place sure is bare. I just sleep here. Is your new place like this? It's a 10,000 yen 3-mat place. I might actually hold you in respect. So I guess this is good-bye. What are you doing? Taking a shit. A gift for the landlord. Are you nuts? Don't! What're you doin'? C'mon man! Keep them on. Why? Let's go. Why? It was this close to coming out! Hey. Remember a TV show called Weekender? Oh yeah, I remember. My father was on it. Oh, why? My father is a sex offender. He committed an awful crime when I was in 5th grade. I was watching TV with my mom and sister, when my dad's photo came on. My mom panicked. Told me not to watch and turned it off but it was hell after that. I couldn't go to school. Neighbors would throw rocks. We had to flee by night. I'm the son of a contemptible, dirty sex offender. No matter how hard I work, or try to do my best, it's no use. That's not true. Your dad's the one guilty of wrongdoing, not you. Really? Do you think so? Yeah, I really think so. You're a good guy at heart. You're not like your dad. Guess what? To tell you the truth... Yasuko actually has a boyfriend. You said it might work out. That was a lie. A big fat lie. I'm desperate now. You never know, though. What? She might have a boyfriend now, but she might break up. She said it was long-distance. See? If she's willing to be friends, then there's always a chance it'll work. You think so? Yes I do. I feel better already. OK, let's drink! Yeah, let's drink. Yasuko. He says he wants to apologize. Come on. I'm sorry about the other day. I really regret what I did. I apologize. Won't you make up with him? Why don't we go out and have some fun? I was about to die from boredom. Nice timing. Then you'll forgive him? Friends. Don't lick me again. I'm so sorry! I'm in trouble. Toss it into the gutter! Boring! This is my first time bowling. Really? I've never met anyone like that. You'll be fine. Just throw it. You can do it! Go for it! I did it! Yay! I win! Lift up your leg. I'm not looking. Come on. Man it's freezing! It's cold, but it feels great! Come on, you two! He's nuts. It's freezing. Shoji, come on! You're a good swimmer. What? Oh, what the heck! It's so cold! Whoa! Awesome! It's so cold. Wow, you really do swim well. Awesome. Oh, it's so cold. I have to pee. Oh no, you don't. - I have to shit, too. - No! You're both so silly! Why don't you join us? OK, then. It's so cold! It feels great! - Yasuko. - She's coming. Hey, Yasuko! This feels great! It feels great, Yasuko! My shit might be around there. Kanta peed in the water. You did, too! Isn't this great, Yasuko? It's great. You can see through her shirt. We can see through your shirt! Shut up. Hey, lend a hand! One, two... Ow! Ow! That hurts! One, two... It's no use. Go get someone, quick! Call an ambulance! Get a jack! Go to the office and get a jack, quick! Hang in there. We'll get you out in no time. My foot. My foot. Hang in there... So slow! What's taking so long? Hurry up! Hang in there. Hold on just a bit longer. It'll be OK. Kanta, did you hear? Mr. Takahashi had surgery but ended up losing two toes. And he's not insured because he's a day laborer. You think he'll be on crutches for the rest of his life? Maybe. Mr. Maeno said this was from the company. This is all? Shouldn't you be in hospital? Shut up. Having a dream won't do you any good. You think you have lots of potential, don't you? Well you don't. You can't do a thing. You'll just work, eat and die. That's life. Got that, junior high graduate? Nothing good will happen for the rest of your life. I like books. Huh? Reading is about the only thing I enjoy. So what? So... I want to write something. You couldn't write a thing. You're just a junior high graduate. But I still want to write. Stop singing karaoke! You suck. Gimme that. We are so nervous There is nothing special in Erimo in Spring Here, we have a friend visiting us from the cold place Please feel free to warm up here After Takahashi's accident, Kanta ran away from warehouse duty and went back to being a manual laborer. Hey there. Oh, you were waiting? Let's go together. Sorry, I have something to do today. Oh, I see. I'll go ahead, OK? Good work. Hey. Sorry, I'm busy today, too. Hey. You've been avoiding me lately. I have a prior engagement today. Oh you do, huh? Well, good thing you're always so busy but if you're lying to avoid me, then it's really insulting so drink with me as an apology. Don't be ridiculous. I really have to go. I'm seeing some friends from school. You mean from your vocational school? Some will be from other schools, so I can't just skip out. Do you mean it's some kind of a social get-together? Yeah. Then women will be there? Some from the women's colleges will be. Would it be inappropriate if I were to be at this party? Well, yeah, it would be. I didn't organize this get-together, and I think they've reserved a place for a set number of people. Are you bragging to me? Why did you emphasize that they were from women's colleges? Was it a dig at my lack of education? What? You asked what kind of gathering it was so I just told you. So you think I'm a resentful moron. Yeah, I'm a moron. That's why I'm working as a day laborer. But aren't we in the same boat? I never said that. You're so damn hard to deal with. What? Don't be so angry. Maybe some other time... I don't know, when some other opportunity comes up, I'll invite you. Sorry. I didn't think it was worth mentioning so I kept quiet, but I'm going out with someone now, so I won't be going to sex services with you anymore. I see. I had no idea. Good for you. Good luck to you, too. Say hi to Yasuko. Excuse me. Extra service? 2,000 yen for hand, 3,500 yen for blow. Blowjob. 3,500 yen, please. Excuse me. Are you Sumiyo? What? It's me. Kanta Kitamachi. Oh, Kanta. What are you doing? Isn't it obvious? You don't want it? I want it. OK. Excuse me. Ah... Ow. Ow, man! Good-bye. What do you want? Let me do you. You're insane. You used to let me do you for free. Stop following me. I still remember what you did to me. What are you talking about? You ditched me easily for another guy. Did I? I forget. That was such a long time ago. It was only 2 years ago. Excuse me for a sec. Look, I got the pictures developed. Look at this. Where's this? A bridge? Why did we take a photo at a bridge? Look at our poses. - Give me another. - See, that shirt's so hip. I'm glad I chose it. What the heck!? This is at the inn. We're drinking tea. That shirt's so hip. It looks great. Oh, this. Where is this? Stop laughing, you potato. What? I never liked you at all to begin with. I stayed because you let me have sex. I figured you'd be good practice, but you smell so bad. Better wash. You're too gross to go down on. What the hell are you saying? Shut up. You stay out of this, old man. Ow! You always go too far, Mitsu. What? Sorry about that, man. Eat and drink all you want. OK? You can do her as an apology. What are you saying? Don't you want to? No thanks. She's too gross to go down on, huh? That's not true. Then do it. No, thanks. I said to do it. Hey, stop. This is ridiculous. Then how about a friendly threesome? It's all right. No thanks. No, thank you. - Strip for a threesome. - No way. - Strip. - No, don't! Don't! Stop it! Please don't. Mitsu, you're so mean. Mom. All right. Then... Let's play zoo. You do a lion, Sumiyo. You, a monkey. I'll be a gorilla. Do it, bitch. You, too. This isn't fair. Shoji's just a hick in a vocational school, and yet he's enjoying all the joys of youth. Having sex for free with a bitch in heat like he deserves it. She surely has diarrhea all year long, and is a poor, STD-ridden bitch with a naval full of gross lint. No, wait. Kanta. This is Minako Uzawa. Hi. Hi. Let's go, then. 15 points. How is he? He's not bad. She has many friends so she'll match you up with someone. Thanks a lot. She's full of curiosity about various subjects. She knows a lot about film and theater and goes to see them often. So you're a studious person. Do you want to become an actress in the future? I want to get a job in media. But I've only just started university so that might change. By "the media," do you mean TV? Not just TV. Newspaper and publishing, too. I hear the major publishers have good health and welfare benefits. She's already sought-after in various events. That's impressive. At the upcoming campus festival, she's going to emcee the talk show by Shinichi Nakazawa. I'm just going to be there to nod and smile basically. But it's unheard of for a freshman to be given such responsibility. It's really not that big of a deal. I just read a lot of Inuhiko Yomota's critical essays, so the event organizers found out and made me do it. Still, it's a good way to make connections. Having contacts will be useful someday. You're right. But I'm not a very good speaker. That's not true. Your relaxed way of talking is ideal for emceeing. What? No way. It's true. I've never flattered you before. Thanks. How old was he? Slightly under 30 I think, but he had passion. That place holds events a lot, so why not go help them out? Sounds good. Maybe I will when a good chance comes around. Oh, and he said he knew the editors of GS magazine. That's awesome. It's the hottest New Academism magazine. That's awesome. I'm so proud of you. You're in Shimokitazawa so you'll meet such people, too. - I will. - You will. Hey. You're awake. What were you saying about Shimokitazawa? Minako's apartment is there. Why do you ask? Why do you country bumpkins insist on living in Setagaya? Seriously, you hicks have the tendency to live in Suginami or Setagaya when you come out to Tokyo. Why is that? Do you consider those areas the basic status of city life? Or is it some characteristic of that lame subculture and New Academism mentality that you love? Don't you see that such thinking brands you as bumpkins? And you think you're doing something new? Shimokitazawa, my ass. True Tokyoites like me frown upon those areas and would never consider living there. Oh, not again. Hey, shut up! You didn't care about movies before, but now you're a connoisseur? Don't act sophisticated to show off to a woman! You think there's a difference between my kind of movies and yours? You opportunists! Shove that talk show of yours, you dumb student laborer! Minako. If you only see him once a week, you must be frustrated. So do you masturbate most of the time? You masturbate, right? So do you? Do you? Hey Minako, please. Let go! Let go! Introduce me to a friend of yours sometime, OK? Introduce me to a friend of yours sometime, OK? Get off me! Introduce me to a friend of yours sometime, OK? Introduce me to a friend of yours sometime, OK? Stop it, Kanta! Please. I want a girlfriend. I beg you. Please. Hey. Let's go out again with Minako. How about in Shibuya this time? Don't ignore me. You're so cold. Then how about just you? I'm busy. Just one drink. Let go of me. Stop acting like such a baby. I can't hang out with you anymore. Kanta? What's wrong? I just wanted to see you. You were at the bath? You're soaking wet. Will you let me inside your place? I'd like some hot tea. But it's getting late. What's the problem? I'll leave as soon as I have some tea. You won't let me in? I'm sorry. But I don't think this is right. What isn't right? Come on, let me in. Why won't you? You're scaring me, Kanta. You really want to do it, don't you, Yasuko? You're actually burning with desire, right? Aren't you? Stop. Stop. Let's do it. Let's do it. - You'll love me then. - No! Yasuko. I love you. No! Come on. Please. Even if we do it, I won't fall in love with you. Couldn't we be friends? I don't want a friend. Then it's over. Kitamachi, what's taking you so long? Hurry up. What's your problem? What the hell are you doing? What's with you? Acting so sulky today. Hey. Who do you think you are? Hey. You loser. Do it over. Damn it! Every one of you, treating me like shit! What the hell are you doing!? Every one of you, treating me like shit! Rut that down! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill every last one of you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Come get me! The bus is here! Hey. Give me your phone number. OK, but... I'm planning on moving in with Minako, so I really won't hang out with you anymore. Don't call me unless it's something urgent. Yeah, OK. And... Ray me back the money I lent you. OK, I will. I don't have it now, but I'll pay you back. Then, I'll take the train home. Yeah. Shoji! You were my friend. Thanks. I really appreciate it. 380 yen in all. Isn't Ms. Sakurai working here today? She quit. I'm moving again. Huh? My rent's 10,000 yen again. Communal latrine. If Ms. Sakurai comes, please tell her I said thanks. She probably won't come anymore. Kitamachi. This isn't a library, you know. "Suggestion No. 2! This book reminded me of you, Kanta." "Hope you like it!" "Three Years Later" How about it, mister? Lots of pretty girls inside. Maybe some other time? Thanks for always coming. How about it? Big boobs. Short stay's OK. Hey Mr. Shiga. Lend me some money. I just lent you some recently. There's a book I want. 10,000 yen, 20,000 yen, what's the difference? Come on, please? No way. Then 5,000 yen is fine. Nope. So stingy.
