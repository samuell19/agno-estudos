Come on kids. All she heard was a thud on the roof of the car. Over and over again. Thud, thud, thud. It was the hitchhiker. A couple picked him up. Banging the boyfriend, severed head against the roof of the car over and over again. That's not true, that didn't happen. Did too, my brother told me. That's just an old story they use to scare kids. But if you wanna hear a real story, a story that actually happened right here in Century, one that is true, I can tell you that. It's about a man named Wall who was cursed by a gypsy after he didn't pay what he owed. And every Halloween he rises to walk the Earth disfigured as a horrible, evil clown. I don't think I could handle another scary story. Don't be such a baby. What I'm about to tell you could save your life. The only way he could break the spell was if he found someone to take his place. After 100 years cursed to walk the Earth, Wall thought he found that someone. He knew if he could get the boy to drink the elixir maybe he could break his curse. Come on it's getting late, let's go home. Hey buddy, you okay? Happy Halloween. I'm gonna ask you a question. See if it's true, Fancy being a clown boy being one of us. Too bad for me. So sad for you. This here, drink will make you rich. Giving magic powers too. It's called the elixir, a potion of fun. If you drink this drink you'll out live everyone. Smell a fragrance just have a taste, take a little sip become one of us. Don't make me make you Dad! Dad, dad, dad! Drink. Help! What the... Get away from him. Dad! You're gonna live forever. You're gonna be out your door. Welcome to the freaking circus, buddy. You're my freaking boy! Jordan, honey. In here, just finishing up some stuff. Hey babe. Good morning sweet pie. It's early, you're already dressed? Good morning little acorn. Can we tell people yet? No. We need to let the world know. Not for two more weeks. Ah, come on man, you're killing me. I can't take it, I need to tell someone. No. What are you up to? Ah, come on. That Halloween thing again? Not even born yet, mommy's trying to give you nightmares. You have to go to work. You're not gonna bring that up at work again, Are you? Seriously Jordan, you could lose your job over this. We can't afford that. I'm already working a double at the restaurant, okay? We need to save while you can still work. There's a kid in jail and a killer on the loose. I can't just let that go. Kid in jail, killer on the loose, and a baby in your belly. We're the most important thing here, Okay? Us, family. Look, I know you feel there's been an injustice here to this kid. That's not our problem. Paying the rent, that's our problem. Raising a kid, that's gonna be our problem. You just gonna have to let this thing go, okay? So mommy is going to be smart now, not do anything silly, especially in the first trimester. More than a second, isn't she? Isn't she? Yeah. You gotta let me tell someone. No, please come on, just one person. No. Fine. Later Gator. Well crocodile. You're going to be late. I know. Nobody, just a ton of blood. Remind you of anything? Yeah. 82? Yeah fortunately. She was a jogger, I.D still in place. We just heard what they described as a loud scream. That's what you're gonna say, right? No, shriek. As in the sound of total terror. Look at this. - It's the same as - Oh, come on. last year, and same as the year before that. Our guy is back. What if it wasn't the kid? What if it's the killer clown? Do you guys need help with this? - No - No We're good Rodriguez. 'Cause I can help. I was first on scene. Oh, you were first on scene, huh? Yeah. So why isn't this whole area cordoned off? You've got a whole bunch of people walking around through this crime scene totally unchecked. What is that? What is that? Is that the media? I think it's got something to do with that TV show they wanna do about us. You know, that undercover detective show. Hey man, how do I look? Is my hair okay? Really? Are you serious? It's from the Chief. I got one too. Come to the office immediately and wear a suit. It's happening, we're on the show. We're on the show, I knew it. It doesn't necessarily mean that. I was on point with the audition, I knew I nailed it. And you, you were the one who was telling me I was wasting everybody's time and money. No one would hire me, I'm the stupidest actor, I was wasting everybody's time, but you know what? Are you seriously gonna walk around through the crime scene? Oh, right. Rodriguez, wanna help? Sure. Just wrap it all up and notify the next of kin. Do all the paperwork. You need to hire a suit. I have a suit. I don't need to hire anything. Hey, I'm gonna be on that show too. I just haven't got my email yet, that's all. What are you doing Chuck? Put that camera away. I can't man. I'm making a documentary for my media class. What on us? On everything, It's like a day in the life of Chuck. Ha ha, Cool. Hey guys, guys, guys, come check this out. You remember that story about that creepy clown running around century park? Yeah. Yeah, well he's coming out tonight. What? Look, it's says blue the clown is back for one night only. Get wasted with a creepy clown? Are you feeling me? That, that sounds really stupid. I can, going trick to trick my little sister. Trish still trick retreats? She's like 22, man, isn't she a little old for that? What? Halloween like Ken? Yeah, well, bring Trish Madison to park, get embarrassed and we'll find Ken. I Feel like John's the one who goes trick or treating, and Trisha makes sure he doesn't do anything stupid. Whatever, man. Okay people, what do we got? Oh geez, again with a hand, Ken? Sorry, just super keyed, talking pets. Talking pets? You know, dogs howling in the tone of a human voice. "Hallo Raggy, I love you" Anyone else? They still talk about what went down in Chicago, escape patients, military coverup. The half-dead. Yeah, I'm just saying. I have a relative up there, could be a story. I think I prefer Ken story on talking pets. It's a little more realistic. What else? Well, there's the blue clan sightings... Ah, again. Well, it's almost Halloween. You know it's gonna happen again. He's gonna strike, he's done every year for the past - No. - five years. The Police have got their guy. The kid? Mm-hmm. The kid that's been locked up for years still killing people? Come on. There is no story here, okay? No killing clowns, no copycat killers. Nothing, Nada. I think there's a story here. We could break this wide open. Oh sweetheart, we don't break things wide open, We tabloid. Hey, listen, don't worry about what happened in there. It's bullshit, right? Margaret, please let me do the boost story. I have a lead, a serious lead. What's your lead? So you want to be a real journalist? Real journalism is dead. Go get a Twitter account. I have a Twitter account. Good, then you're halfway there. Hey guys, I found the next of kin. They weren't happy. Of course they weren't happy. You're wearing a suit? Yeah, didn't you get the email? Oh, we got the email. Did you get the email? Excuse me, TV guys are waiting for us. Captain. Come in. Gentlemen, as you know, we start filming this new reality TV show today called undercover detectives. Congratulations, you're both part of it, but I don't want any of this going through your heads. Remember, this is a major PR activity for the unit. Everything you say you'll be recorded. Something funny? It's just an observation my partner made. You care to share? - Not really. - Tell him. - Tell him. - Tell him It's good. Well, I was just thinking the shortened version of undercover detectives would probably be UC Dick's, right? Is that what we're doing here? - No. - No. It's good. Like tonight on UC Dick's, like am I right? Like big lights. I didn't come up with the name detectives just like you. I'm only on the show. Captain. If you keep up this attitude, I'll get Rodriguez to take your place. Don't do that. Is this the TV thing? The undercover detective thing? What do you want detective? I was just seeing if you guys wanted me to grab you a coffee or a donut. No, we're good. No. Or a piece of fruit? No, no, no. You guys? Thank you.

So why was the chief talking about back there? Like, what happened on Halloween last year? Yeah, I'm not sure we're really supposed to talk about this stuff. It's still an open case. Open?

What about boo? Seriously? They say that leading up to Halloween, he takes a human flesh sacrifice, just to feed his unnatural demon life. And then he takes the blood from the victim and creates an elixir just to keep him alive. Where did you hear that? Reddit? The Internet? Come on. I don't know. I just heard it. A demon killer clown. Do you remember the creepy clown sightings last year? Yeah. Candy, look at this. So? This one. So the guy likes to have his picture taken in the park. Same guy? Russia, China, Australia, America, Africa. So the guy likes to travel. Same day, Jimmy. All in the same day, same time, same year. How can it be in the same place, at exactly the same time?

So this type of murder, is this something that you see regularly? Unfortunately, yeah. There's something particularly off about this case. I don't know much we can really say is it's still an ongoing investigation. summer. It should be done by then, right? Jefferson thinks we have a serial killer on the loose, six houses all at the same memo. Kitchen knife across the back face juggler, I mean deep cuts to he. Or she. Or she, has been going on a serial killing spree the last couple of years on Halloween. And here's the kick the draining the blood. The blood ah, any leads? Working on it.

No, no, seriously, he did that. Or like I said before, vampires. Vampires. No, not this again. Okay, look at the facts, right? They're older people, right? Yeah, obviously the vampires then. They're all surrounding the century park area. Which is where vampires go to private school. And play on the tee to totter. Yeah, okay. And they're all in some type of hardcore medical treatment. Like heavy duty drugs shit. Okay, yeah, that could be something. That is something. Yeah, like I said, you're good but I just said that to make a point. There's something going on.

They're not supernatural. They're just some fucked up guys dressed in clown suits, that's all. And I'm going to kill them. Okay, calm down Look, someone's gonna get the cops, and I am leaving. Whatever, I'll go. Here check this. Here is the GPS in the camera. Hopefully it won't be chatting too, okay? Okay bro, I'm staying with it. Will you be okay? Sure, got a flare gun. I'll be all right. Do you know where to go? Yeah, I'll be fine. I'll bring back the Take care of that, that's my life. Let's go kick some a ass. Help, somebody help me, help. You don't need help, you're already dead. And the help that you crave is the attention I dread. Let me out of here you bastard. I need you to shush! Be really, really quiet. 'Cause what I'm about to do, and with you, you know Let me go you motherfucker. Help, somebody please help me. What are the shush? Do you not understand? Now as punishment, do I drill your neck, your nose or your hands? You motherfucker, you motherfucker? You're thinking, you're going to get out of this. Sadly for you, let truth be told. This here room is the last Your offer of sacrifice, although greater that I. You're sick, you motherfucker. And most definitely be a fun. We have to do this ritual every Halloween. It's like a thing for the gods Guy, we have a problem. There's more cops in the gate. It seems that they traced us to our humble state. Did you bring friends? No. If they heard what you do? or for the slaughter? No. Or for the stew? Don't do that. Get him and bring him down here. We can top up the elixir with fear. Don't do that. You motherfucker! You ready? Set. Here we are at century park, and as it's Halloween, we've decided to come out in search of a clown named boo. With us tonight we have detective Samuel Rodriguez, and you may know him from the hit TV show UCDs. Thank you for being my bodyguard here tonight. You're very welcome. So UCDs is a very successful run in the past few years. It has, it's been a crazy ride. Now, is it true that in the pilot episode, you actually lost some officers right here in century park? Yeah, still remains one of those mysteries to this very day. We believe they came across a drug deal that went bad. Mark Castle was the cameraman that night and he also lost his life. We think that after witnessing other offices dying, he took his own life. With a shotgun? Yes. From the car? Sure, each vehicle was fitted with a Mossberg five 90 pump action shotgun. The pressure leads to suicide. It's a sad story. Well, this definitely is the most confusing mystery the city has ever seen. Do you think we'll see a clown or clowns here tonight? No. But you're still willing to come and search with me? Sure, if that makes you happy. It sure does, Let's go find boo. That handsome clowns. Are you getting this guy? Yeah. Let's go. What was that? Do you see anything? It's probably just bears. They're a lot scarier than clowns, right? Bear is a real. You know those things were peculiar. Come on, let's not start on them. Over here. Who's coming for you? Hey you, you with the gun. Put your hands in the air. Go on, run. Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming. Are you always dressing like.. Hey Why you always wanna like Who are these people? Where are we wearing the same costume? Maybe we should just go. What? We know where they are now. We gotta get the cops, get some help. Yeah, actually I think that's a good idea. Just follow me, I'll show you inside. Careful of the floor, Jimmy. You're gonna have to watch your step, there's a lot of jagged edges. You don't wanna cut yourselves. Careful. Got it. Oh my gosh. Well, this is scary. Yeah, well you don't wanna be living here, that's for sure. So this is where Charles Finley said he saw the clowns. Correct, but we've gone over the place. We've found nothing. Nothing, no DNA, no bloodstains? Not a thing. Surely you found some kind of evidence of DNA from a squatter or something? Nothing. Okay, we're set. So this is where your fellow officers were found? Yes, this unfortunately is where a sick young man killed some of our officers. And they were your friends? Well, mostly. I mean they all gave me a hard time, but you know that's all part of the biz. Got it. Thanks. Good? Yup, just doing some cutaways. Did you see the falling off his jacket? Yeah, I did. Now it just says C dicks, Okay. Let's get the fuck out of here. Let's go. Are you getting this stuff? Come on, this is incredible. You think this is cool, wait until you see the tunnels I'm going to show you. Jordan, pick up your phone. in the park. You and Jimmy got to get the hell out of there. That'd be now. No, we can't let you go. You know too much, here you must stay. You should try your hush. This is the room where nightmares come true. Consider it your tomb, your temple of doom. Now, which item to use? Hmm, which one is best? This one. This one seems fancy. May not need the rest. No, no fuck. What did you say little boy on the wall? Will you drink the elixir? Use of life, hairs on your chest Come, fuck yourself. So the choice has been made. Sacrifice found. We'll mix your blood with mine, the elixir we'll create, keep the nightmare alive and drink to your fate. I'll keep her alive, I promise you this. Don't worry about that. Just try not to piss. Well, this is creepy. Yeah, well, everyone here knows the stories. So it doesn't surprise me that there were things like this in this tunnel. Well, this used to be a subway tunnel, right? Correct, but there's an old war tunnel down here. They used to use it to store supplies, you know, keep high ranking officials and dignitary safe during possible missile strikes or air strikes, that sort of thing. Now are just forgotten. Come on, follow me in here. Come on. Right here, Jordan. Hey, it's Jordan, leave a message. Look Jordan, I need to tell you something. Is there an incident with an officer in the park? Okay, call me as soon as you can. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah I'm good. Are you okay. Yeah, it's just the smell of this place. It's a funny smell, can you smell it? No, I can't smell anything. I guess I just have a crazy sensitive nose. Come on, let's keep heading down. Let's go. Okay guys, it's not too much further. What the fuck? What? I saw something. Well, it's probably nothing. It's good that I'm doing playback. There's a clown. I told you I wasn't crazy. Oh, cameraman Jimmy just thought he saw something in these halls. We've gone over playback. And if you look at my phone, there's definitely something or someone in here with us. It's likely that they're just kids playing a prank. I mean, it is Halloween after all. Come on, keep following me. Jordan, I think we should leave. Yeah, I think you're right. Please don't leave, you have to stay. It's Halloween, I wanna play. I said don't leave. There's two of them. I thought you heard, running back this way is kind of absurd. As I'm standing here, now you've been heard. Ready to stab you. Killing is my plan, wouldn't go that way? This way is no, no. It must be confusing. Which way do you go, go? What do we do? Look. Boo. Boo. Run, run. Coming with you. We're going the wrong way Jordan. We're going the wrong way. What the hell just happened? Did you see that? How the hell do we get out of here? Hey boo, boo. Go, go, go. Run. What the hell happened in Rodriguez? Oh, this isn't creepy? Run. Run. Come on this way. Oh my God. What the hell is this? Oh my God. That's one of the cops that went missing. That's Jepson. There's a story here, two cops. These guys are UC Dick's original UCDS. That's the missing girl for the year earlier. Halloween is full of craziness. We all know what happened last year. I knew that kid was innocent. We arrested a guy last year who we think is the clown. Please kid, put the gun down. The kid has been locked up for years, you're still killing people, come on. Are you sure you got the right guy? Chuck Finley was innocent, I knew it. There's one alive, get her down. Oh my God, I'll cut you down. Don't worry, We're gonna get you out of here. Instead just kill me. Kill me, kill me. You can't escape. I won't let you. You should've done what she asked you to. No I can't, I just don't have the heart. So I keep her there safe in the dark. Now, your friend with the camera, he just won't do, it's time for that man to become a boo. Oh shit. Jimmy. Over here. Jordan. Sit down. Will you drink the brain? That's he question I asked. Are you serious or not? We'll all have a blast. Elixir in the jug? Okay, she thought so. Last chance to answer. Do it, you're good to go. I drank the blade. I drink it too. Drink our elixir, you'll become a boo. I'll drink it. I'll drink the elixir. Give it to me. Take a sip to change your life. You'll be okay for a while. You'll bang your wife. Halloween gotta go back and drink some water. Or think. How do you feel? Feels good, don't it? Oh man, brought you a sacrifice. If allow. Unlock these chains. You're dead. Not dead yet honey. Hurry up and Kill her quick. I have my own, I need to stake. Back off you freak. You're an abomination. I can smell what's inside you. The boo, the boo has finally spread and now he keeps me here locked up, barely fed. See here, we're connected you and I. You know nothing about. Wrong, I know everything about you and your unborn spawn. You need my bloodline to survive. If you want to keep that baby of yours alive. He will kill me, you must help me. He'll be at his weakest soon. Take this and when the first light from the all saints day sun strikes the earth, his mischievous done, get to the light. What's taken so long? Go. Kill him off, get to the light, get to the light. Jimmy. Not anymore. Get to the light. Kiss the sun. I think it's time you came into the light. Will you? No. Jimmy. What just happened? You're a clown. Oh my God, did I? You tried to kill me. What's the last thing you remember? Walking into the tunnel, to torture chamber? I drank the elixir. Oh my God, are you okay? The baby? I think I'm okay, but I don't know. Can we tell anybody yet? And that's a story of how the all powerful, all knowing boo began. You're so full of crap. How do you know all of this? My mom told me. Your mom? She's a journalist, she knows all about it. I never want to have Halloween again. Lily, honey, time to go. Jordan. You guys. I've gotta go, my dad's here. But don't forget what I've told you. Boo's everywhere and he's coming for you tonight. Come on, baby, we gotta get ready for a night. Mommy's waiting for us in the car. Hey kids, she told you about boo, don't worry, you'll be out soon. I'll see you guys around.
