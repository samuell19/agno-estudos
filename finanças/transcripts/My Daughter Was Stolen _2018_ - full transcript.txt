[BELL RINGS] [BELL RINGS] - Sorry we're closed. -Alisha Barnes? -Alisha we were just hoping we could get a few words from you. -It's been 10 years since your daughter was kidnapped and... - Don't even say it! - I know her body was... never found but your ex-husband did... -My daughter's not dead! -You see... people will want to know that you still feel that way. -I'm sure they will also want to know your feelings about your... subsequent divorce. Or perhaps you didn't care to... tell us after all these years that there was any truth.. To the rumors that you had been drinking and taking... sedatives the day of the kidnapping. -Which may have somehow enabled the kidnapper to take Jesse. - I have nothing to say to you. - It was a major story... at the time Alisha. People all over the world followed... what happened. Which is why we think since it's the... 10 year anniversary... - Anniversary? -Huh... -Our viewers want to know what happened to you, I mean... -You have to admit this is a far cry from the famous success... -Famous success? I mean, don't you people get it? -I would trade all the fame and success to have... one more minute with my daughter. -Leave me alone! Leave me alone! -Maybe it would help you to come to terms with... what happened if you would just talk to me Alisha! [ON TV] ♪ Put on your boots. ♪ Put on your coat.

[SIZZLING] [FLAMES] -Huh! -You want to burn the house down? - I'm sorry Mama... - You just ruined my dinner! -Come on. Come on. You know what this means. - No Mama please I'll be good... - Now, Come on... -Mama please... [DOOR CREAKS] -Go on now. Get down there. - Mama please... - Do you want to fight? [HEAVY DOOR SLAMS] [ON TV] -Good evening. It seems like only yesterday when... little Jesse Barnes was kidnapped from her happy home... on the day of her 5th birthday... by Lucas Powell. -A man who police say was actually hired to... -Hey! Oh... nothing. -Just watching some stupid TV show. [ON TV] -Unfortunately after that fateful day neither he... nor Jesse were ever heard from again. -And while it may only seem like yesterday... reality, it's been ten years to the day. -So we here at Entertainment Now wanted to touch base with the... two people at the heart of the story... Jesse's parents, Jeff and Alisha Barnes. -Jesse's father, Jeff Barnes remarried the following year. -His wife Valerie Saunders, renowned psychologist and... author of the bestselling book... "Coping With Tragedy"... happens to have a daughter from a previous marriage who... who is around the same age Jesse would be now. Jeff was kind enough to speak to us about the ordeal and... ..we'll get to his interview in a moment, but first... we wanted to update you on Jesse s mother, Alisha... since she was at the center of much of the controversy... surrounding the kidnapping. Alisha Barnes had become... something of a household name during the four years... preceding the kidnapping because of her popular role... on the hit TV show, Bayou Nights. At the time, Alisha had suggested to police... that the kidnapping may have been the act of a deranged... female fan whom she had encountered the day before. But all of the evidence pointed to Lucas Powell... and rumors circulated that Alisha had been drinking... and taking sedatives the day of the kidnapping... which may have somehow allowed the kidnapper to take... five year old Jesse without her even knowing about it. In the months and then years that followed... Alisha always vowed to never give up her search... for her daughter... And the tabloids continued to fuel the rumors of... Alisha s battles with drugs and alcohol. To address this and some other questions... we sought out Alisha Barnes and finally caught up to her... last week at a little coffee shop in a rural area... just outside of Chicago where she now lives and works. [OLD NEWS FOOTAGE] - you had been taking... sedatives the day of the kidnapping which may... have somehow enabled the kidnapper to take Jesse. -I told you I have nothing to say to you! -It was a major news story at the time, Alisha. -People all over the world followed what happened. -Which is why we think, since it s the ten year... anniversary... - Anniversary? People are going... [EXHALES] our viewers... want to know what happened to you. I mean you have to... admit this is a far from the fame and success you... -Fame and success? Don t you get it? -I'd would trade every minute of fame and success to have one... more second with my daughter! [DOOR CREAKS] -I thought I told you this room was off limits. -I-I-I'm sor... I'm Sorry... -I'm sorry? Sorry isn't good enough! -Mommy's going to have to punish you. -Please Mommy no. No, no, no. [DOOR SLAMS] [LOCK OPENING] -hat do you think you re doing? -My name isn't Jackie! It s Jesse! -Get out... you don t know what you re talking about babe... -Get out of here you don't know what you're talk... -You re not my mother! -Listen to me! [SLAP] -Outside! Now! -You kidnapped me! [SMASH] -Jackie! -Jackie, don't leave me... Jackie, Jackie, Jackie... -Jessie, Jessie, Jessie... No, no, no, no... -Come on, Come on... Don't leave me, don't leave me.. -Jackie! -Jackie! [FAINT TV IN BACKGROUND] [PHONE RINGS] -Huh. [CALL ENDED] [LONG EXHALE] [PHONE RINGS] [CALL ENDED] [SNIFFS] -Huh! [TV] - unexpected happy ending... from what I am sure was an unbearable 10 year ordeal. -For her and her family... - It really is remarkable, John. -Kidnap victim, Jessica Barnes, showed up at a police station... late last night in Jackson... - Jackson. After disappearing ten years ago... -Now according to police she had been held captive these... past ten years by a woman who over time, had apparently... had brainwashed Jesse into believing... [PHONE RINGS] she was her mother. -So far the media has actually not talked to any detectives... ..at this point. We're still waiting to hear from... -Is this really happening? -You ve heard then? -Yes! Yes, I'm watching it now! -We have to go get her! -The police are bringing her here as we speak. -Uh, there? T-t-to you? -Yes, I made arrangements earlier this morning. -They contacted you first? -A few hours ago. -Why didn't they contact me? -They didn't have your number so I told them... I'd get ahold of you... - Ok. -Um, I'll be... I'll be right there. -Alisha? -Have you been drinking? -What kind of question is that? -I'm just saying. No drama, okay? -She s been through a lot and we want to do... what s best for her, right? -Yes. -Yes, of course. -Ok, I’ll see you when you get here. [PHONE DISCONNECTS] [STRONG BREATHS] [CROWD COMMOTION] -So we're here outside the home where we believe Jesse Barnes... is currently. So far detective have not briefed... the media. But we do believe something's going on. -Because detectives are now outside there... -Mommy... do you think Cat and Mouse can really be best friends? -They have not again talked to us... to answer any of our questions... as to where Jesse was at this point. -Who found her. -And also whether or not Alisha Barnes has... seen her daughter or yet. - Alisha! - Alright! Come on! - Give her some room! - Alisha!...Alisha! -How does it feel to know your daughters been found is alive? - Will you talk to us? - Get down! Come on! -Get away! Get away! Get away! Get away! - Come on now! Back off! - Where'd they find her? - Can you tell us where... - Let, let her through people... -Let her through... alright, alright people... give us some space... alright backup now, backup... [MUFFLED CROWD NOISE] -Alisha. -Where is she? -She's upstairs sleeping. -Oops, wait! -What are you doing? I want to see my daughter! -I'm sorry she doesn't want to see you just yet. -Why? -Apparently she saw some of the show regarding the kidnapping. -And... it wasn't very flattering for you, Alisha. -They started rehashing some of the rumors about you drinking... that day and the whole thing, you know... -But it's fine. Ok, I'll talk to her. I'll clear that all up. -There's a things that... we want to discuss first. -Val? -What is this? -this is a temporary court order that's gonna spell out how... things a go on from here on out. Uh, custody and so forth. -Sole custody? You didn't waste any time. -You re not fit, Alisha. -She's my daughter! -I can smell the alcohol on your breath from here. - I'm her mother! You can t do this to me! -That may be so but you also have a substance abuse... problem and that s the last thing she needs in her life... right now. - I can change! -The court order is good for 30 days. -after those 30 days... we can re-evaluate it review the situation. -Well, I don't want to wait anymore. I want to see her now! -Val, step in anytime please. -She has nothing to do with this. -She's a trained psychologist. Val, please. -Alisha... Jesse suffered a trauma of unimaginable proportions. -You think I don't know that? -Then I'm sure you want what's best for her. -According to Jesse the woman who held her captive for... ten years was a substance abuser too. -Alcohol and pills. Did you know that? -So, I'm sure you can see where Jeff is coming from. -I said I'll quit! -That s wonderful and I'm sure you have very good intentions... in saying that but... quitting cold turkey is a hard thing to do. -It takes time. -You have to understand that Jesse was severely traumatized. -Mentally, emotionally, psychologically... The last thing we want to do is... -Jesse. -Jesse! Back to the bedroom please! -Wait! Jesse wait! - Alisha! - No Jesse! - Alisha! - Jesse wait! -Jesse!...Jesse! -I was five years old!

I'm not really hungry. -Ok. No Problem.

She doesn't want me here! -You think I don't hear you on the phone... with your stupid friends! -Jesse... that is not... -Of course she wants you here. -It's just going to take time for us all to... -Do you believe her? -Do you believe I stole their jewelry? - We can sort this out, ok? - That s all I needed to know. -Jesse... - Wait, Jesse! - Alisha what are you doing here? -I came to see my daughter. -In case you forgot there s a court order... prohibiting you from being here. -I ve been going to AA. I just got my 30 day chip. -That s good. Good for you. I, I hope you stick with it. -Don t you have a flight to catch? -Ah, I lost track of the time. -Go get ready. I’ll talk to Alisha. -Will someone just tell me what's going on... with my daughter? - She s a thief. - Jude. -Well she is! -Apparently she took some things that didn't belong to her. [VEHICLE ENGINE] [VEHICLE ENGINE] [HEAVY BREATHING] -Excuse me. -Can I use your phone please? It s an emergency. [PHONE RINGS] -Hello? -Hello? -Jesse? -Jesse? -Jesse? -Excuse me. -I'm the one who called. -The girl who used your phone? -Oh, ah... yeah... she, she left. -Well where'd she go? -I, I don't know. [EXHALES] [VAN ENGINE] -Thanks bro. Later. -Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa. -What s the hurry? Hmm? That van is following me! -What van? I don t see no van. -Know what I think? I think you... just need a little something to calm those nerves. [CHOKING] - Let's go back to my place... and have ourselves a little party? [STRUGGLING] [MANIACAL LAUGHTER] -You are a feisty little thing, ain't ya? -I know a lot of people that'd pay good money... for a sweet little treat like you. -Hey! Let her go! -Let her go! -Let her go! -Where the hell did she come from? -Well this party keeps getting more... and more interesting by the minute. -Jesse, close your eyes and turn away. - What? - You know this little minx? -She s my daughter! [YELLING IN PAIN] -Go! Go! [TIRES SQUEAL] -Thanks. -Mom... for what you did back there. -Jesse... I will never let anyone hurt you again. -Why did you leave your dad s? -I don t want to go back there. -I just... don t wanna go back. -Ok. I know it's not as big as your Dad's but... it's cozy. -Um... let me show you to your room. -You re not going to make me go back there are you? -Hmm... it's complicated. -You don t want me here? -No, that couldn't be... further from the truth. It's just um... your dad has a court order. -Is it true that... is it true that the day I was taken you... -It s true that I was drugged. -But I didn't take those drugs. -The woman who took you put those in my drink. -Sounds like something she would do. -Did she hurt you? -I don t want to talk about it. -Of course. -Well, we should at least call your father. -And let him know that you're with me. -That you're safe. -I'm not a thief. -What? -That s why I left. -Jude and Valerie said I stole from them but I didn't... and he believed them instead of me. -I see. -Jude hates me. -Jude...[EXHALES] can be difficult. -Well this is my room. -And this can be yours. -Can I go lie down now? -Of course. -Just let me know if you need anything. [PHONE VIBRATING] -I'm in Sacramento. We can talk about the court order... when I get back. - Jesse is with me. - What? -And, she doesn't want to go back to your house. -Judging from what she told me I can t say as I blame her. -She s 14 years old. It doesn't matter what she wants. -Baby, I can t find my other earring. -I guess it s true what they say. -A leopard can t change its spots. -It s not what you think. -Oh come on, Jeff. -Do you really think I didn't know what was going on... between you and Valerie even before Jesse s kidnapping? -I just chose not to admit it to myself. -That s why it was so easy for you to believe... that I took those drugs. -To avoid putting any of the guilt... of what happened on yourself because... you were too busy... having your little affair with Valerie... to show up to your daughter s birthday. -Alisha. [PHONE HANGS UP] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] -It's open. I spoke to your father. You re staying with me. -He agreed to that? -Well... he didn't really have a choice. -You hungry? -I think I just want to sleep. -Ok. -I understand. -Don't hesitate to ask if you... need anything. -Can you please... please lock the door? -Sure. -Jesse... I'm right next door. [DOOR CLOSES] [DISTANT DOGS BARKING] -She s here! - What? - Momma! She s here! -Wait, but what, I... there's no one there. -She was there! I saw her! - What? - She was following... me today! - What? -In a van. That s why I called you. -Why, why didn't you tell me that? -I, I, you have to call someone! The police! - I just saw her! - Ok! Calm down. -I believe you... ok? [DISTANT DOG BARKING] [DOOR OPENING] -Well, I've been through every inch of this property and... -She was there! I saw her! -Maybe it was just a bad... -It wasn't a dream! -Jesse... the woman you re talking about is dead. -She died in the fire. -We recovered her body. -I don t care what you say! I know what I saw! It was her! -She seems certain. -Listen, I'll tell you what. -It s only a couple of hours until sun up. -I’ll park out in front, that'll help Jesse to feel better. -And it'll help you two to get some sleep. -That'd be great. Thank you. [EXHALES] [DOOR CLOSING] -Jesse... I told you I'd never let anyone hurt you again. -You believe me? Right? -I'm sorry. -You don't have to apologize. [DISTANT OWL HOOTS] -Well, that's just Wilbur. -Wilbur? -Ah, he's just an owl that pays me a visit sometimes. -I like owls. -Me too. -Hmm, there's that beautiful smile. -You know when you were little. -That smile... would take all my cares away. [DISTANT OWL HOOTS] -Do you want to sleep in my bed for the next couple nights? -Can I? -Yes... I'd love that. -Well, it s official. I'm taking the week off. -I might have them make you blueberry pancakes. -I ve never had blueberry pancakes. -Um... well... [CHUCKLES] actually you used to eat them all the time... when you were little... I've... -Just trust me. -You'll love 'em. -Mmm... we just have to run to your dad's. -I don t want to go there. -Well, we have to get some of your things. - And I already called Valerie so she's going to have it ready. -It will just take a minute. -I'm going to go pay the bill. -Ok. [PLATE HITS FLOOR] -Jesse, what is it? -Out there! -It was her! She was there! I saw her! -Ok, just, just stay right here. Ok? -No! Don t leave me! -I'm, I'm just going to take a look across the street. -No, please! -You don t believe me. -I believe that you saw someone ok, but maybe it was just... someone who looked like her. - No! She was there! -Jesse... there's no one there. -I saw her! -Ok... come on... let's go. -Can I wait in the car? -Sure. [DOORBELL RINGS] -I have to say I'm surprised you got Jeff to agree to this. -I guess I just caught him in the right mood. -Why do I feel like there s something you re not telling me? -Maybe you should just, talk to Jeff. -Did Jesse ever say anything to you or... about, seeing the woman who kidnapped her around? -Here? No, why? -She seems to think she saw her around my house last night... and again this morning at my work. -She never said anything like that about seeing her... but she definitely had nightmares. -Nightmares? -Yeah, like every night. -No one was getting any sleep around here! Nightmares about the woman who stole her? Possibly. She never wanted to talk about them. -The trauma survivor, their brains can play tricks on them. -Even to the point of hallucination. -Or, their bad experiences they blocked out... -as defense mechanisms can come back suddenly. -And play out as flashbacks which to them... can seem very real in the moment. -Little thief didn't have the guts to come... to the door herself, huh? -Jude, that s enough. -Don t push it, Jude. You got what you wanted. -What s that supposed to mean? -It means I believe my daughter... when she tells me she didn't steal from you. - You calling me a liar? - Jude, I said that s enough. -I'm calling you what you are, a brat... a brat who just couldn't stand not being the center... of attention anymore. -So you decided to eliminate the competition. -By putting the jewelry in my daughter's room. -And turning everyone against her. [EXHALES] -Why didn't you tell me about the nightmares? Wait, you think that was a nightmare this morning... at the coffee shop? No, I, of course not it's just... sometimes our minds can play... -I knew you didn't believe me. -I didn't say that. -Can we just please go? -Yeah... of course. -You're sorry? Sorry isn't good enough! -See what happens when you're not nice to me! -What is it? -There should have been two! -What? If she died in the fire... there should have been two women, not one! -I don t, I don't understand. -She used to put me in the cellar to punish me. -There were two dead bodies down there. -She said that it was her sister and her husband. -That they made her angry and... she was just going to let them rot down as a reminder... to me that I shouldn't make her angry. -Ok... -Let's talk about it inside. -Hey. -It'll be ok. -I don t know, I think... maybe we should... - Hey. Hmm. - You trust me, don t you? - Yes. -And you believe me when I tell you... that it's going to be okay, right? -Right? -Yes. -Make sure you lock the door. -No, please, don't go! -Jesse, I'm just going to the store to pick up a few things. -I'll be back in an hour or so. -No please! -I don't understand, ok. -I told you, you could come with me. -I don t want to go anywhere! What if she... -That s enough! She s dead! She died in the fire... and you re just, going to have to accept it! -Now go inside and watch some TV... until I get back. Ok? -Mother! Please don t go! -Just go back inside, ok? -Just call me if you need me. [ON TV] - A hotdog. - Huh? Hotdogs? - Yes, I... -I just love them. I eat mine Chicago style... -Mustard -I... [DOOR LOCK] ♪ Hotdog, hotdog... ♪ Hot diggity dog... ♪ Hotdog... ♪ Dog, hotdog... [DOOR LOCK] -Don't move. -Do you understand? -Drop the knife. -Drop the knife! [KNIFE HITTING GROUND] -Jesse! Open the door! [ON TV] ♪ Diggity dog hot... -Open the Door! ♪ Hotdog. -Inside. -Hi Jesse. -Get the duct tape. -Jesse! -Jesse, get the duct tape. Just like we planned. -Jesse, I think you missed me. [GUN HITTING HEAD] [CRIES OF PAIN] [COUGHING] -Get up!...Get up! -You don't remember me do you? - Of course I remember you. - No... no... ..no... not from when I was outside of your house... pretending to be your biggest fan. -I met you long before that. - No... - Yes! - No, I never... - Yes! -Yes! -It was at the callback for your TV show. -Ok. -It was down to you and me. -I was your competition. And I went in right before you. -You have no idea who you're messing with. [BANGS ON GLASS] -That was you? -Yes... that was me. -And after you left me I got into a car accident... and that's why I have this scar on my face... and that's why I look like this! -How could I know that? -And how would you know that I was in a coma for six months... when they were trying to put me back together... and how would you know that then I went through... three years of rehab just to learn how to walk again. -And how would you know that my half-sister came to help me... but instead she stole my husband. [CRYING] -I lost my baby... [SOBBING] -I'm sorry that, that happened to you... but you can t seriously blame me? -You don't get it do you? -For four years everywhere I went... I saw your stupid face... on TV... [LAUGHS] in magazines, on red carpets... dressed in expensive clothes, you are rubbing elbows with... the beautiful people. Well that was supposed to be me. -I was supposed to be the star. -Not you! Ok? -That was supposed to be me! -You ruined my life. -So I took great pleasure in ruining yours. [PUNCH] [YELL] -I won't ask how she got the bloody nose. -I love you Jesse. I really do love you. -Get her out of here. -I’ll need you both to come in and give a formal statement. -No problem. -We'll be there in 20 minutes. -That'll do. [ENGINE STARTS] [HANDCUFFS CLICK] -I feel really sick. [COUGH] - What? -I said, I think I'm going to be sick. -Sorry, I'm not buying it. [VOMITING] [COUGHING] -Ah geez... are you kidding me? [COUGHING] [SOLID SMACK] -What will happen to her? -Well, she ll probably go to jail for the rest of her life. -She can't hurt you ever again. [POLICE SIREN] -I think he wants me to pull over. [SIREN CONTINUES] [SIREN STOPS] -I'll be right back. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] -Get Down! [CAR PEALS AWAY] -Huh, Huh! [THUD] [TIRES SQUEALING] - Stay down! Stay... - What is she... -Look at what you're doing to her. Look at what you're... she's just... look at what you're... she's mine!
