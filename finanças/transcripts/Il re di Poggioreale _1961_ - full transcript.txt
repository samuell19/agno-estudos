Naples 1943....1945. Some episodes in the life of Giuseppe Navarra, alias "The King of Poggioreale" As dictated by him to the authors of this film... and placed in a fictional family setting. 'The King of Poggioreale' - Some charity. - What charity? There's no room for charity nowadays. Get out of here! Then let me look at you. You're so handsome. The portrait of a butcher. God bless you. Put a sock in it. What do you want? Start walking. Okay, whatever you say. I'll give you 20 for him without the shoes and watch. - Final offer. - No, we'll keep him! You want a nice Negro? You can put him in the car and do what you want to him. - Go away. - The deal of a lifetime. If you don't mind? Cigarettes with a treat. If you want a treat, come and get it. Let's go. - It's your turn. - One moment. - I beat you this time. - You're so damned lucky. - Who's in charge here? - What do you want? Identity papers. Stand up when you speak to me. I'm Natalucci, the new commissioner. - Well, who's in charge? - Please, this way. Brigadier. Wake up! - What is it? - It's the new commissioner. Brigadier Cristofero Pasquale at your service, sir. Welcome to Poggioreale. Where's my office? My office. Over here. How did I know? - What are these? - Charge sheets. - Fugitives, I imagine. - We have our hands tied. The police have their hands tied. What can five beggars like us possibly do? Our guns are broken and we don't even have one bullet. They don't trust us. - And who would they be? - The ones at allied command. You don't earn trust with guns. It takes guts. It's Natalucci, the new commissioner. I'm talking to you. And you're supposed to be police officers. Look at the state of your uniforms. You're an embarrassment to the force. I'll show you what a uniform means. My car, sir! Damn it! - What's going on? - Looks like they stole his car. I had my back turned but he saw who took it. Let go. - Were you here? - Maybe, I don't remember. Why? Did you see anyone near the car? That heap of junk? Wiseguy! Where's my car? The last time I saw a car like that was Christmas. In piazza Plebiscite, it had blue bodywork. Lock him up. May I have a word? Apart from the fact that prisoners have the right to a bite to eat... And you're paying for it, because here... Apart from that, you're wasting your time. There's only one way to get it back before they turn it into a sailboat. Which is? The King of Poggioreale. What did you say? The King of Poggioreale? With a bit of diplomacy you'll get your car back. Just leave it up to his Majesty. Come on, let's go. Good morning. - Good morning, dad. - Enrico, how's your tooth? - It's much better. - Let me see. You've got some fine teeth that come from my family. - Sleep well, your Majesty? - Califano, a king never sleeps... and when he closes his eyes it's only because he's thinking. Let's get down to business. What's the news today? We're noticing a shortage of milk. The bombings don't reduce pregnancies, in fact they increase them. What's happening to the milk supplies from the Americans? What's causing these shortages? - Anything else? - I'm fed up of studying. What? You must never get fed up of studying. The more you learn, the higher up you get. - Professor, how's this kid doing? - Very well. Understood? Now go study some more. Wait, dad. - I need some money. - Sure. Mind how you spend it. Why are you giving me these and not those ones there? No, that isn't our money. That's the poor folks' money. Okay, now go study. Don't waste time. There are at least fifty more than yesterday. Then tell them to speak quickly, like on the phone. Talk like you do on the phone, understood? Okay, I'm listening. They treat us old timers like trash! They shut down our watering hole. Re-open the watering hole and bring more provisions. Thank you, your Majesty! My house collapsed last night. Thank you, majesty! Born an orphan, mother died giving birth, adopted by a beggar... forced to pretend to be blind, starvation up to here... My poor health. Treated for tuberculosis. As soon as I was twenty they sent me to fight in Africa. - Now you're broke. - That's not all... No, that's all. Here, take it. Buy yourself a good luck charm. Make sure it's nice and big and keep it around your neck. I left Reggio Calabria by bus. I've looked for my daughter in the colleges in Naples, she's disappeared. - I was told to turn to you. - Do you have a photo? Of course. She's very pretty. Too pretty. - Have you checked the allied bases? - That's my daughter! My minister of the interior will take care of it. But if you find her treat her well. Try to understand. No, thank you. I'll be right back. What do you want? More? Here! A happy face! Wait a minute. Enough! Be quiet! - What do you want? - Nothing, just to show you this. He was born four months ago and I'm so happy. - Wish him good luck. - Sure! You just keep smiling like that, okay? Here's a good luck charm for you. Thank you very much. These things don't concern me. This is a matter for the Queen. - Where is she? - She's in the boudoir. Then take her to the boudoir. Next. We're almost there. So beautiful yet so unlucky. Can you stand up? Yes. His Majesty wants you to help this poor girl. - He says it's your area. - Okay. - You're pregnant. - I don't know anything. I didn't want it. I just turned eighteen. I've always been a good girl. Men make me sick. I was sewing near the balcony. Dad said go and buy some olives. I went out, but I had a bad feeling about it. I got to the store and the storekeeper said he'd sold out of olives. He said, come, we'll open a new jar. We went through a doorway and I felt all these hands touching me. - How many storekeepers were there? - Who knows? I tried to scream but nothing came out. They did their thing. I didn't know what was going on. When I woke up I found myself like this. Just like that? Jesus, what times we live in. My father kicked me out. Only you can help me! - Let's help her. - Why not? - Leave it to me. - Thank you. Poor child. We've arrived. - Where's the meter? - I gave it to my wife to grind coffee. - Yes, okay, how much? - It's up to you. - How much do you want? - 1000 lire. I'll give you 300. No. Get it from the precinct. My dear brigadier! It's always a great day when you show up. It's my honour to introduce Mr. Natalucci. Our new Commissioner. - What happened to the last one? - Don't you remember? We lost him in the last bombing raid. Rest in peace. My dear commissioner, I really must thank you. You've just arrived and you're already paying me your respects. Let's say I'm interested in people who can work in these difficult times. If you're interested in me as a man, I can only be grateful. But, if you come here as a commissioner... Let me tell you you're on the wrong path. You're an outsider, right? I've just come from Bari but I'm from the north, I'm Milanese. Majesty, we're actually here to ask you for a favour. In your very kingdom... In your zone. A serious crime has been committed that I'm sure you'll be the first to condemn. Commissioner Natalucci had barely set foot in Poggioreale... when they stole his car. What kind of car was it? It's very modest. Actually, it was a pile of junk. An old Ballila. They don't even respect poverty anymore. Leave it to me. What are you waiting for? Find the commissioner's car. I see you like fine art. That's by a very famous artist, his name was Peluzo. He was in all the papers. His wife cut him to pieces with a razor while he slept, poor guy. I love the sea, I couldn't live in a country without a sea. Look at that clear water and those sails that look like... It's my honour to inform you that your car is downstairs with a full tank. Majesty, you're great. Thank you so much. A full tank! - Aren't you going to thank me? - Thank you? What for? For having all this authority over a gang of thieves? Or for having so much gas you're giving it away? At the opportune moment, I'll remember it. Commissioner. One moment, please. Which one of you can tell me what we've got? - Hunger - Poverty. - Death. Famine and violence, and more death. Okay? In these conditions... Men divide themselves into wolves and lambs. What are you? - I'm a simple brigadier. - Quiet, you. There's still an organized society out there, and a government. Tell me, what kind of painting have you got on the wall in your office? The King? The Allied Chief? Roosevelt? The Prime Minister from the north, the south, or where? I don't think so. So who is Don. Peppino Nevarra? A man who has turned free will into law. And you want to arrest me, because you think I'm a thief. Then arrest me. But tomorrow, Naples won't have anything to eat or drink... and people will die in the streets. Because me and people like me are useless, right? Who said that? Naples is full of thieves, delinquents and murderers! Take it out on them, not me. I'm just trying to do something. Maybe you are, but how? Making them call you king? King of a bunch of layabouts and thieves. It's my duty to make sure they respect the law. And I'll make sure they do! Don't worry. That's enough for today. Everyone out, even the ones in the courtyard. Don't push! A week? God will look after you for a week then it's Don Peppino's turn. - Are you here for business or pleasure? - Business, we've got merchandise. - Cigarettes? - No, sugar, 200 sacks. I heard there's a gambling den here and I'd like to try my luck. Can I? You want to play? Old lady luck should love the young. It's always an honour to have the King of Poggioreale's son here. Look who's here. The Prince of Poggioreale's come to pay us a visit. Want to try your luck? Bet on the ace of hearts, it's good luck for handsome guys like you. What are you doing? Quitting? You won a ton of cash tonight. Come on, dance for us! What are you waiting for? Let's go. Come on, get into your teams. Saint Gennaro's watching over all the teams. Come on, hurry up. Peppi, the water's rising, what do we do? The current's strong. I'm not going to die like a rat. - We don't want to drown. - It's too dangerous. I'm not going. You want to run out on me, and you're all agreed. Come on, speak up. Yes, sir. And if you think you can keep getting rich off our backs, you're wrong. Because we're not coming! Coward! After I saved you from starvation? If you've made any money it's because of me. Now you're doing better you want to abandon me. This stuff is for people who are hungry. If I hear another word, from any one of you... and I guarantee you I'll drown you in the sewers one by one. Now get in the water. Help! Help, I can't go on! Help me! Don. Pasquale, this way. The door's up there on the right. If Margelina's team would slow down. Half a kilo of 1000's. Three kilos of 50's. Let's go. You take over, Concettina. I'm going to get a coffee. Good morning, everyone! Enjoy your bath, Don. Peppi. Thank you! You flatter me but I'm not handsome, I'm jinxed! Soap and brush. Ready? Fresh water! Let's go. You start. From the abandoned houses we recovered 13,000 windows and 8000 doors... 250 bath tubs, and this is the best! 200 tons of various material. Electrical wire, pipes, furniture and other stuff... Are you crazy? Are you trying to kill me? That's enough hot water! I don't want to end up like Caesar. Caesar was stabbed in the back. Water's innocent. You idiot, it's the result that matters, not the means. Relations with the Americans, black and white, are great. The English are hesitating a bit but we're still waiting for a final answer. The Indians have promised us a load of pipes. And we're in negotiations with the Australians for a big load of shoes. Try to close the deal soon, I'm tired of seeing people barefoot in Naples. It isn't easy, the Australians want to do an exchange. They give us the shoes and they want fresh eggs, and salad. What are you waiting for? But they also want a hundred women. From good families, to take to Australia to increase the population. They're crazy! They can find their own wives. We're not pimps. That's right, we're not pimps. We need to teach them a lesson. We'll get the shoes the usual way. Consider it done. - There's a new invasion. - The Russians? No, fleas, millions and millions of fleas coming off the ships. People can't stop scratching. They're starting to complain. What are the Neapolitan fleas doing? Why aren't they fighting back? And now, from the bottom of our hearts... rises this sincere yearning for spiritual catharsis... crushing the reign of the apocalypse. While mothers cry... The flies here are a real menace. He says they won't work with the fascists. Flour? No, sir, I don't know anything about Buffalo division's flour. I've already given it to the civilians. I'll get it back. Yes, sir. More trouble, Buffalo division is threatening to occupy the building... if we don't return their flour. - Continue, professor. - It's love... Or until our children's world triumphs over evil. Do you know what he's talking about? Venereal disease. He's asking for penicilin. - Do we have any? - No, sir. Buffalo division. The usual procedure, five crates with 1000 doses. You'll get your penicilin but we'll end up in jail. I assure you we'll remember this generous deed forever. - Where did they all come from? - They have an appointment, it's midday. Midday already? Impossible, I have an important meeting. - But there's also a police officer. - Who's the police officer? - That's me. - Come here. - A pleasure, my name's Natalucci. - You have one minute, is that enough? - No. - Then come with me. Sorry, but the Colonel can't see you today. I've been given a difficult district but I'd at least like to do my duty. How? With four malnourished, unarmed men? - You'll get supplies. - No, I need guns. - That's out of my hands. - Then who should I ask? Come back tomorrow, I'm very busy today. I'm meeting the King in five minutes. - He's in Naples? - Yes, do you know him? I saw him once at the officer's school. He's a great man, he saved my life carrying me on his shoulder for ten kilometres. You mean the Prince? He's a strapping lad. No, a king in person, Don. Peppino Navarra. Come in! - You look great! - Thank you. These are all my friends, and they're my ministers. Now, check out the surprise I prepared for you. Do you remember? It's been almost two years. That's me and that's you. The Germans didn't mess around with prisoners. Now, I've got a surprise for you. A firearms license. The first one in Naples. Thank you. - It's mine. - You're giving it to me? It's magnificent. I'm speechless. It's loaded. Where's the clip? Put it in the trash. You must excuse me, but we don't want any loaded guns. We've had enough wars. But I'll treat this like it's platinum. Now, let's eat! Look, it's all in your honour. Just some cans we had lying around. We do what we can. My cook. Here's the menu he prepared. Let me read it out. I see you've spared no expense but I don't want that. I want to eat pizza! Yes sir, pizza! Whatever the guest wants they get! You'll taste the best pizza in Naples. We make the best Neapolitan pizza in New York, in my restaurant. I make it with my own hands. Four colours and four flavours. What do you mean four colours and four flavours? You make your Majesty laugh. I don't mean to offend, but Neapolitan pizza compared to ours... - It's disgusting. - Then you're challenging us? Pizza versus pizza! Everything we need in one minute! We'll show him how to make a pizza. Like we were waiting for the Americans to teach us how to make pizza. Where do I wash my hands? Okay, it's all mineral water. - Is the flour good? - I hope so, it's from the USA. Did it fall off an allied truck? That's genuine olive oil, we import it directly from California. - You import it? - Right! How about a little bet? - 1000 dollars! - Money? No! - What then? - Kilowatts. - What do you mean? - Kilowatt hours, months, years. What kilowatts? You know Naples. You know how we live here. At night, Poggioreale's like a jungle. Sure, I've got electricity because I have my own personal generator. But, my dear Jack, I want my people to see where they're walking. - I want people to see each other. - What about the municipality? What can a municipality that's poorer than the people do? Listen, no offense, but I'll take care of the installation... but if you lose you'll take care of the current. If your pizza wins Poggioreale will have electricity. Could we have electricity for the Saint Gennaro celebrations? Allow me. You expect me to eat that? - Try it first, then speak. - Okay, I'll keep quiet and wait. I trust you, you taste it and decide. We're going to get electricity! - Can I come in? - Who said you could come here? You know me now. There's little to know, men are all the same. - Then why did you lead me on? - Me? You're crazy. Okay, come in. I get it. You're the mysterious type, but I can't be the first person to come in here. You might be. How do you know? - Is all this yours? - I work, just so you know. I didn't mean to offend you. Why won't you tell me? What do you do? I'm a truck driver. A truck driver, I told you. - You drive trucks? - I stop them and the guys do the rest. The money's good. Look at it. You like it? I want a mountain of it before the war's over. If you ever need a loan. - You earned it with the allies. - Like your father, but he earns more. Then you gamble it all away on the ladies. Not the ladies, they come to me for free. Maybe. Don't you like me? No. Because you upset me. What you said before, when you came in. I told you I didn't mean to offend you. If I came, it's because... It's too difficult. Anyway, what do you care? Yes, you're right. Because all I care about is having one of those fur coats... that drives people crazy when you're walking down the street. - What a dream! - Why do you need a fur coat? - I can buy one, can't I? - But you're still beautiful. People aren't going to like you because you've got a fur coat. You're a fox! Do you love me? Maybe, yes. You're such a fool! You know the situation here better than me... and you also know we can't do anything unless you give us guns. Listen, Commissioner... You see? Never a moment's rest. Listen, I'm sorry, but it's important. If we keep going like this it will end in chaos. - You can't deny it. - I agree completely. Then give us the guns we're asking for. You listen to me, I don't dish out guns like tins of powdered milk. And may I also add, Commissioner... that Allied Command is in no hurry to arm a population was until recently... That's not the point. Naples can't go on like this, driven by men like Navarra, even if you like him. Italy's gone through some bad times, but it's working hard... to regain its honourable place in the world. And, as far as I'm concerned, I want to help Naples in this new battle. I want it to be an honest city, inhabited by honest people. And I can do it, if you grant me a little authority. After all, we're both fighting for the same cause. Give me those guns, you won't regret it. The General's on the phone, he wants you to go to him immediately. I'm sorry, Commissioner, That's how things stand. Great. This is what it's come to. Stealing from your father. And you steal from all of Naples. It's true, I steal. But if I steal, it's for Naples. Come with me. Look! That's why I steal. There's my kingdom! A bunch of beggars who only cling to me because I'm stronger than them. That's how it all started, give him a hand, give her a hand... and more people kept coming, always more starved. Now I'm caught in this trap and I can't get out! Sure, they all respect me now! They even call me King. But I could be in jail tomorrow. You don't have to follow my example. This is my time. Not yours, Enrico. You have to get ready for yours. Study, work! And hard! To be a man. A real man. Not a thief. You have to promise. Do you promise? Yes, dad. Okay, go. Enrico told me everything. He isn't a bad boy. Unfortunately we have so little time to look after him. You know what the most precious thing in the world is to me? Something you can't even buy on the black market. It's time. Time! It's true. You can never find the time when you're a king. The days fly by. Yes, I know. But what kind of life is this? A big house. That doesn't warm the heart. Running here, running there, we shout, we worry... and we're never together. What good is this power of yours? We used to spend entire days together. You played the guitar, sang. Time didn't mean anything. Those were good times. Do you remember? I remember everything. Even the days when we were starving were good. Of course, we were so happy with so little. All it took was a ray of light in our alley... and everything shone like gold. The fruit on the market stalls. The rags. Everything. Do you remember my first minister? Oscar. When he sold tripe. And Crescenzo, who sold calamari. Calamari. Then you arrived. And with you, Enrico. Even when he was little he tried to copy you. "Give me bread and wine" Can you take me to the village? You're real pretty. That's it. Get in position! You know how it works. He was supposed to find the truck empty. He wouldn't have noticed a thing. Now I have to kill him... because he's seen us! I'm a German prisoner! I like Italians, I won't report you! - Say your prayers! - I promise, I haven't seen anything! - Mountains of cigarettes. - Maybe too many. Lots of coffee. - But where's the flour? - It's true, there isn't any flour. - We can't find it. - Do I have to think of everything? - Swap the cigarettes for flour. - There isn't any, we can't find it. They're complaining at the markets. What little there is costs a fortune. Why didn't you warn me? What will they do without flour? There are lots of ships loaded with provisions. What? What did you say? All I said was one ship would be enough for me. Just one. - A nice big one. - No! A ship, ship! Jesus, a whole one? Sure! An entire ship. That's impossible. A senior medical officer in the American navy. Two or three MP's. Someone's coming! We'll discuss it later. Everyone come upstairs. - What are you afraid of? - Who could it be? - What if it's the Italian police? - What police? - Shall I get the revolvers? - No. - Who could it be? - How do I know? We'll find out. Open the door. - Be careful. - Let's get the guns. No! Who could it be? How do I know? - It could be thieves. - In my house? There's an envoy. - Who sent him? - How do I know? God or the Devil. Listen to me, it's probably the Devil. Show him in. - Peace to all of you. - You're welcome. Are you Don. Peppino Navarra, known as the King of Poggioreale? - That's us. - His Excellency would like to see you. - The Bishop? - Be careful, your Majesty. - What does the Bishop want with us? - Not us, you. You're getting ready to run. It wouldn't be the first time. You must come to the cathedral. - Now? - Yes, now, his Excellency is waiting. It's a trick! He smiles too much for a real priest. One moment, Father. I'll get my hat. Come in. Good evening, Don. Peppino. Thank you for coming. I know, deep down, you're a good man. That's why I'm asking you for a favour for the people of Naples. Saint Gennaro! Saint Gennaro, what have they done to you? Where are all your jewels? Your robes? Your cloak? Since the outbreak of war Saint Gennaro's jewels have been stored in the Vatican. But now the boming raids have stopped... Naples wants them returned to its saint, in his church. So I ask you to go to Rome. Go to Rome and bring back Saint Gennaro's treasure. To Rome? Me? I have faith in you. And so does He. Because He knows you've taken care of his poor. Excellency. A thief? There was one on the Calvary as well. A good thief, like you, Navarro. The roads to Rome are swarming with bandits. Who else could do it? The police? They haven't got the means. No. The occupying forces? It's hardly the case. Only you, Don. Peppino. Do you want me to go? - Okay. - Thank you. Count Pignatello. For centuries his family have been the custodians of the treasure. It's my pleasure to introduce you. The Count will accompany you to Rome. And now, my children, I give you my blessing. For a pleasant journey. So everything's clear about the ship? - No questions? - None. Saint Gennaro help us. We could do with you as well, Saint Gennaro. Come out with your hands up. Is that the way to treat a friend? Bruno! Bruno Lamarza! Navarra! You know who this is? He's my good friend Don. Peppino Navarra, the King of Poggioreale. You're doing well for yourself. Naples is yours now. I knew you were smart. We have to make do. He's made millions. - Who's that? - Don't worry about him. He's one of mine. He works in the churches. A job I don't like. I don't want to miss out on this opportunity to have lunch with a king. - What is it? - The car. Don't worry, my men will take care of it. It sure isn't a palace like yours! But the wine's good, and there's a lamb I killed just four hours ago. Sit down. I'll get the roast. Look! What a beauty. I'm so hungry... For you. - How are you doing? - Very badly. Only the hungry use this road now. I should have stayed in the city and made my fortune like you. What are you talking about? You're the most famous bandit in Italy. That's true, everyone knows Bruno Lamarza. But what has it got me? I'm still alive but I'm broke. - Things will change after the war. - That's the problem. Now's the time. Something big, you get it? A load of gold. Gold and diamonds. Not worthless bank notes. Gold's gold all over the world. It can be melted down, and the diamonds can be cut... and sold in pieces. I'm just waiting for the right chance. A nice haul of gold and diamonds and I'm going to Argentina. I've got it all worked out. I'll buy a nice farm, somewhere hot. With thousands of herds of cattle. Every now and then I'll pick up a broad in the city. Just like picking up a pension. I have to go. Goodbye Bruno, and thanks for the hospitality. - What's the hurry? - There's still a long way to go. I guess you're right. - What a great car! - It's a heap of junk. - What have you get there? - In there? A pile of ties I found in Rome, nothing much. I got them cheap. Why don't you give me one? I haven't worn one in years. Of course, you're right. That's junk. My old friend Bruno deserves my scarf. And the scarf. Thanks, Don. Peppi. You're a real friend. I shouldn't have done it. I should never have trusted a man like that. And I was the one who persuaded him. The temptation. It's my fault. With a treasure like that in your hands, who wouldn't have resisted? Forgive me, Saint Gennaro. My intentions were pure. Perhaps I shouldn't have spent so much time... worrying about gold and precious stones. Neapolitans would have worshipped you even without them. Forgive me. We wanted another miracle from you... but you punished us instead. Forgive me. Count Pignatello, did he leave you in the middle of the street? It was terrible! Saint Gennaro will punish him! You must forgive me. Me, forgive you? I had my doubts. It wasn't easy, you had good reason. There were times when I thought we weren't going to make it. But then it worked out okay. I doubted you, you must forgive me. Sure, sure... There's nothing wrong with having doubts every now and then. If it didn't belong to Saint Gennaro... Don't make me speak, Excellency. Thank the heavens, and bless Don. Peppino with all our heart. They're not doing anything. They're my friends, and yours. Nobody wants to arrest me. Let us pass, and give these guys a big applause. Jack! How are you? It's Colonel Di Gennaro to you. Allied commander of Naples. I'm sorry, but have I done something wrong? - Where is the ship? - What ship? Don't play dumb with me! A 12,000 ton ship, loaded with provisions, vanished! I don't know what you're talking about, I wasn't in Naples last night. - Where were you? - I went to Rome, on business. My ship! Your Majesty! It's none of my concern, but why all this fuss over one ship? The Germans sink so many of them full of provisions. The fish are feasting. Maybe some hungry people took the ship because... You can't reason with an empty stomach, you'll never get it. Enough of the Jack, you don't fool me with your Neapolitan tricks! You come crying on my shoulder, you're poor, you're hungry... It doesn't work anymore. Americans and Neaploitans aren't friends! I could have surrounded the illegal markets and taken it all back. - But you didn't. - Of course. I'm not sending American troops out to steal milk from children. It's from my ship. Some guy had the nerve to sell it here, in front of our headquarters. Listen, I know where my cargo has ended up. But I want a bit more of my ship, before they take it apart. I'll see what I can do. Listen, Navarra... I promised you electricity for Poggioreale. But you find my ship. Who is this Saint Gennaro? The patron saint of Naples, a Christian martyr. You see that thing with smoke coming out of it? The saint's blood has been inside it for four hundred years. Now they're praying because it has to liquidify. If it comes soon then it means their prayers will be heard. But, if it takes too long, then it means the saint is angry. It's my fault! - What do you mean? - Yes! I have to confess something, I'm a thief. I stole your ship, but I didn't keep anything for myself! Please forgive me! What were you saying about that ship? I'll bring it back tonight. Tonight, Jack. Thank you, Saint Gennaro! - Why don't you quit this life? - Sure, then how will I eat? No, I'm sorry but I can take care of myself. And if it keeps up like this I'll buy a nice house. A house with some land. Look! Two stars. Soon the sky will be full of them. Imagine if they were all pieces of silver. Or dollars. And at some point they all fall down, right on top of Naples. Think of the chaos. It would be a madhouse. And when it's over everyone's rich, with tummy's up, like you and me. - Would you still stay with me? - What else would I do? When this war's over you'll forget about me. You'll find someone better. You can't stay with me forever. You'd be a real fool. - Because I'm a... - Shut up. You're talking a lot of nonsense. Because no one today really knows what... Not me or my father, or you, no one... Who am I kidding? When the war's over you'll be fine. People of Poggioreale. The king always keeps his promises. The days of candles are over. But first of all... We must thank our good friend Colonel Jack Di Gennaro. Who, with your help, has made this miracle possible! Silence! The great moment has arrived! Now, let's see you all dancing! I thank you with all my heart. A toast to Colonel Jack Di Gennaro, a friend... A real friend. Farewell, Peppino. - You're leaving? - For the north, the front. - When? - Tonight. You're going to leave us? I'm a soldier, I have my orders. You're also a Neapolitan, don't forget that. I'm a soldier in the American army. Who I am and what I am, I owe to America. Me too. When I was a kid in the Bronx. My mother always said, "Jack, one day you'll go back to Naples..." "and when that day comes, you'll go to via Monte Calvai." "Number 16." That's where I was born. My family lived there. "Kiss those walls, and you'll make me happy." And she started kissing the walls in the room. When I landed here... I went to look for the house. It was all destroyed. Ruins. I couldn't kiss them. Even winning is bad. It's time. A moment's silence. Colonel Jack Di Gennaro has to leave unexpectedly. He has to leave Naples tonight. Let's give him a nice send-off. Farewell everyone. Colonel Jack is leaving us. Maria Pia, Colonel Jack has to leave. Goodbye. God bless you. Let's hope we meet again after the war. You see, we've both helped Naples. I knew what was happening but I closed an eye, sometimes two. But I want to give you some advice before I go. Things are changing, the police are taking back control, and they're armed. They could give you a lot of trouble. Why don't you go on holiday for a while? No. Don't worry about me. Just take care of yourself. And come back soon. We'll be waiting for you, with Saint Gennaro. Goodbye, and come back to Naples soon. A kiss? - No, please don't go. - It's the last time, you'll see. It's the last time, I promise. Can I get a ride? I have to go to a village nearby. Damn it, where's he taking her? - Has it ever happened before? - No, it's the first time. - I forgot my bag. - I'll buy a new one. - I don't like it, let's go back. - What about her? - Forget about her! - You don't get it! We can't leave her. Are you crazy? Okay, but if anything happens, you'll pay for it. Come on, move it. I want to get out, stop! Careful, don't make a noise. - Come and dance. - No, no... Come on. You think a king and queen don't dance? - The Commissioner's here. - What does he want? I don't know, but they might do a search. They've surrounded the house. Di Gennaro was right, the police are starting to move. Go and dance! You as well. You, over there with the others. What's going on? Search warrant. A search? Make yourselves at home. I don't need to read it, I believe you. No, it's not for you. It's for the house. And the secret store room. Secret store room? You're joking! Go right ahead, my house is at your disposal. Listen, would you rather show me, or do I have to find it myself? There's nothing to show. - But go ahead, start here. - I'll start where I please. I'll give you a hand, this must be a false wall and there's something under here. That's enough! This isn't funny. Dad. What's wrong with you? I wanted to make a man of you! All I did was get you killed! My boy! I put you on the wrong path! Be strong, Navarra. If he's gone, then it all has to go! Everything! Listen to me! Everyone listen to me! The King of Poggioreale doesn't exist anymore! Rob my house! Take whatever you want! What are you doing? - Take everything! - Don't move! - Don't worry, he won't shoot! - You're crazy! Brigadier! If you don't take it the police will! Close the doors! - It's a portable safe. - So let's take it! Let go of me! Subtitled by Don. Peppino July 2016
