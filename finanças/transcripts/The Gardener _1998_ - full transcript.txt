You're not gonna grow, unless you drink up. No, come on. [breathing heavily] Paddy? Don't worry. I won't desert you. Not like some people I could mention. [tense music] [calling the dog] Good boy. Good boy. [dog growls] Paddy? [dog cries] Paddy, where are you? [Kelly] You feel stupid. I'm in here with you. [Iris] Hope this doesn't smother. [Kelly] It might. [Iris laughs] Yeah, I hope this doesn't short out. Come on girls! I need my office back. Yeah, keep it in your pants! Kelly, that's the Lieutenant. [Kelly] Fuck him. Alright. -Ready? -I think so. How about you? Are you okay? Yeah. I don't like small spaces. [Iris] Okay. [Kelly] Okay. You nervous? A little. Whom I kidding... A lot. Just remember. We're right next door. If anything happens, we're in there so fast, they won't know what hit them. -Okay. -Alright. -One last thing. -Yeah? Don't let these assholes [indistinct] Got it.

The dopers wouldn't let her bring anyone else to the party. She’ll be fine. Don't worry. This is your partner, Kel. You know her better than I do. [Kelly grins] [Iris] Testing. One, two, three.

Here they come. [Iris] Who is it? The fucking Pope. Who do you think? It's open! Come in. [soft tense music] [indistinct] I like that. -What's he doing? -Chucky boy. He's just checking the place out. Making sure we're alone. There's no one here but me. Yeah? Well, he's gonna anyway. Chucky boy? Alright? I told you. Yeah, you did. [Jake] Got the bread? Got the coke. It's nearby. Nearby? That wasn't the deal! [Jake] Look, love. I got the stuff. And all you got is promises. How do I know you can come up with the money? How do I know, I don't show my product, and then get ripped off? Get real. You looked around! There's no one here but me. Black widow spider can get you just as easy as a lion. No money, no dope. Simple as that. Don't do it Iris. Come on. Walk away from this. [soft tense music continues] Ooh. You can look. No touching. Until I see the stuff. Yeah. Chucky, why don't you go get the dope? [Iris screams] [indistinct] do it! -Please! -Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Fucking rip off! We've got to do something! Lieutenant. [indistinct] They've got Iris! Play it out! Listen, go get the car. When it's out front, I'll look out the window, and then I'll finish up here. -Just-- -Shut your fucking mouth! -[Iris groans] -What's that? I can't fucking hear you. Go on. When the guy holding Iris, get to the car, take him out. What about Iris? [Dean] They're just after the money. Hey, that's bullshit! How do we know he won't kill her? Just follow your orders! Fuck you and your orders. [Joe] Here he comes. We're gonna move now, love. Come on. Come on. Get up. [Iris groaning] [Iris screams] Table. Watch the table.

Why don't you take the weekend, go buy Dave some flowers, for his birthday. [Iris] What about you, Kelly? I never hear you talking about anybody. Is there a guy out there that I don't know about? Oh, I've had enough heartaches. [laughs] I'm just a little burnt. For now. Hey. Speaking of. You okay? Yeah. I'll be okay in a couple of days. Good.

Don't think I've seen you here before, have I? Well, it's my first visit. Promise you it won't be my last. Today is my boyfriend's birthday. So, I want to buy him some beautiful flowers. [Ben] Oh, wow. Come on, move it. Get your hands off me! Get your hands off me! [indistinct] Happy birthday. [man] Aw, thank you. Joe, you've seen Iris? No, I don't think she's coming in. Must've been one hell of a reunion. [indistinct] You know that [indistinct] you let get away at the hotel? -That I let get away? -Yeah. Turns out he's the brother of the boy you [indistinct] at the motel room. His name is Jake Marshall. Well, great. Maybe his mom is in the same line of work. No, I'm serious, Kelly, since you screwed up the case. Since I screwed up the case? Yes! Since you screwed up the case! I want you to get him into custody. Find his ass! Find your partner!

Hello, I'm here. I'm waiting as usual. Alright. Call me if you show up. Guess she's with somebody else partner. [Ben] Hello, Garden of Eden. Flowers. Of course. [punk music] [whistles] Here she comes. Here's she coming. I was wondering if I can get some help. Wonder if you've seen her? I'm sorry. Doesn't ring a bell. Well, that's her car right over there. I've been wondering who's car that is. I'm sorry. I still don't remember her though. You know, I think I saw her. You remember her? Tight ass. Little titties. [chuckles] Little titties. Yeah, that's her. Damn! Not like you girl. See, your body ain't bad. Well, you've got good taste. And I taste good too. Oh, really? Why don't you unzip your fly? What? You heard me. Unzip it. Right here? Sure. What are you afraid of? Oh, you'll like what you see. Oh, shit! Come on! Take it easy lady. [Kelly] Now, if I pull this trigger, you're gonna be pissing out of your asshole. For the rest of your life. Come on. You don't wanna do that. No, we don't. That's right! You're a tittie's expert. And you forgot to tell me you're a mind reader too. Come on lady. Please. Don't. Don't. [screams] Fuck! I got to remember to put a round in this thing. Damn! Bitch! [girl] He's mean. Who's mean? The gardener. Why would you say something like that? He killed my dog. Are you sure? Huh? Aw, poor girl. intriguing music] [Dave] Okay. Smile. Smile. Okay. Don't smile. Alrighty. Okay. Why don't you just sit down on her lap? [Kelly] Dave? [indistinct] Thank you, God. The one and only. So, what can I do to... do for ya? I'm Kelly. Iris's partner. Right. [sighs] So, is everything alright? Or did Iris send you to apologise for this weekend? So, you never saw her? I mean, she was definitely going to see you. Well, she never showed up. I just figured she was out with you, patrolling some big new case. Aren't you a little bit concerned? She never showed up. She's not with me. Don't you think you could stop thinking about yourself for a change? Hey, listen. Of course I'm concerned, you know. Now. But I just find out, alright? Yeah, and you couldn't look for her or anything? [Kelly laughs] What? I was just wondering, if you wanted to have some pictures taken, huh? In the back. It won't take long. And she worried about your feelings. See you around, Dave. Lieutenant! Lieutenant! We've got a problem. So, what else is new? Well, I can't find Iris. I think there's something wrong. What are you talking about? Nobody's heard from her in three days. I went to her apartment. Her bed hasn't been slept in. She's with her boyfriend. No, she's not. I checked with him. She never showed up for the date. Well, maybe after the shooting at the motel, she wanted to take a break. Yeah, but she wouldn't split without her car. I found it parked outside of a nursery. Which I'm pretty sure she visited. [Dean] And? And I found a little girl outside the nursery. That said the gardener inside killed her dog. What did the gardener have to say? I don't know. The place was closed. [Dean sighs] Is that it? That's enough. Isn't it? No, it's not. Iris has always been a little strange. A little strange doesn't mean that she's gonna leave her life without a clue. Well, then find me one. Otherwise, I got a doper out there that isn't arrested yet. Because you're just searching for your partner. Now, if you can't find Iris, let me know. And I'll fire her. You got it? Thanks for the help, Lieutenant. That's what I'm here for. [emotional music] It's incredible, Mr. Carter. I've... never seen anything like it. It's almost... sensual. It's... it's like when I'm with a woman. It's so alive. It's almost as if it's breathing. And this, I have to have. [intriguing music] [birds chirping] [Ben] As I like to call my collection, "women in spirits." [reporter] You're genius Mr. Carter. [Ben] Oh. Thank you. But why are you so secretive about your methods? Look, why are you so concerned about the process? And all you should be concentrating on is the result. Look, we're surrounded by beauty. Why don't you just relax and enjoy it? My magazine is the largest source of botanical information in the country we'd like to do a special edition on your work. My readers, who admire you. And wanna know your secret. [Ben] Yes, but I don't do my work for your readers. [reporter] I'd like to buy your project. [Ben laughs] I'm sorry. It's not for sale. [reporter] I'll pay $10 000. [Ben laughs] [reporter] Tell us about your drive. What made you commit a lifetime to this, "Garden of Eden?" I've told you before. It's a search for purity. There's so much impurity in this world, I thought I could make a difference. Let's make it $20 000. It's worth every Dollar. What do you say? I wouldn't sell this place for a million dollars. And if I had a hundred secrets, I'd never tell you one of them. There's a flower show coming up in a few weeks, will you be exhibiting your work? I don't know. I haven't made up my mind, yet. [reporter] Well, when will you make up your mind? When I'm ready. Alright. That's enough now. I have to go. Talk about your arrogance. He's entitled. No one can create like him. That's a lot of money to turn down. What? Oh, those idiots. Well... There are more important things in life. Well, maybe. But most of them cost money. [laughs] Yes. You own this place? Yes. And much more. Can I show you around? This is just the retail. This is a friend of mine. Have you ever seen her before? Yes. Yes, she was in last week. I remember because she was particularly lovely. She reminded me of an iris. [Kelly] That's funny. That's her name. [Ben] Oh. I said, she reminded me of an iris. All my flowers remind me of beautiful women. What else do you remember about her? Not much really. I do remember that she bought a bunch of flowers foe her boyfriend's birthday, I believe. She said she'd come back and pay me a visit. Well, is it possible that she came back in the last five days? No, I don't think so. You see, I've been on vacation. Don't you have anybody who helps you? With this place? I came back. And the whole nursery was closed. Well, then you've just answered your own question, haven't you? [peaceful music] So, you did all of this? Yes. Everything. It's breath-taking. Thank you. [birds chirping] [Ben sighs] This... is my life's work. [Ben laughs] [Kelly] Wow. The smell. [Ben] I call this one, "women in flames." Amazing. [Ben] That's goddess of the sun. It's amazing. [Ben] This, "lady of the ocean." Um, can I just ask you one thing? Sure. What was your first reaction coming in here? What do you mean? Your feelings. What were your feelings? Well, very peaceful. Very peaceful. I'm glad that you understand the meaning of my work. I think we can be friends. [Ben laughs] I'd like that. Well, I hope you find your friend soon. I'm sure she'll be alright. Did you plant this one? [Ben] Yes. That's going to grow into the most beautiful flower in my whole garden. What kind is it? That's an iris. What are you doing? What do you mean? You know damn well what I mean! -No, I didn't-- -You [indistinct] the flower! I'm sorry. Oh yeah. I bit late for sorry, isn't it? Well, I'm very sorry. It's a living thing. It's alive. Yeah, I know that. They feel pain. Real pain! A flower? Yes, a flower. It's even more sensitive than most human beings! Well, I'm sorry. I didn't know that. Alright. That's alright. Most people don't know that. I'm glad you told me. Yeah. We won't have this problem again, will we? [whispers] Sorry. How's it going? Slow. Anything new on Iris? Nothing. I've check the, missing persons reports, on the other side of town. There's got to be a pattern. Or maybe not. What's that suppose to mean? Look, Kelly. I don't wanna discourage you, but maybe Iris just took off. We all know how close you two were. hell, it's only natural to get attached to your partner. But... But we all know she was different. Different. You mean, she just couldn't hang with the guys. Oh, Jesus. Listen Kelly. I'm on your side here. You know that. [sighs] I'm not mad at you, Joe. I'm just mad at myself. I can't even find my own partner. What kind of cop does that make me? You're a great cop, Kelly. [spitting] I'd be honored to work with you. Anytime. You have any leads, any suspects? Well, there is this old gardener. And don't know if I'd call him a suspect or not. But he just didn't sit right with me. You want me to do a rundown on him? Yeah. He's name is, Ben Carter. He's about 60, 65 years old. Thanks for being a friend. Yeah. -Goodnight. -Night. [sighs] [intriguing music] [Kelly] Christine Minnie, 22. Suzie Johnson, 24. Amy Jones, 19. Yeah, alright. I get the picture. They're all young. yeah, but they're all young and beautiful. Yeah, so they're beautiful. We've got five women who are missing from the same general area in the last two years. And what is this general area? "The Garden of Eden." That's a reach, Kelly. I look at your map, I see all sorts of possibilities here. Even if I was gonna make a connection, which I'm not, which I'm not. I mean, they could be missing in the area here by this restaurant. This area here by the apartment stores. -Here by the gas station. -Hey, I get the picture. No, you don't get the picture. You don't get the picture at all. You've shown me nothing. Nothing at all! There's women missing all over this city. You can't even show me, and prove that your partner is missing. There's nothing that ties that gardener to any crime! Any crime at all! What's it gonna take for me to prove that I'm right, Lieutenant? Evidence, Kelly! There's something really strange about this guy. And for this he should go to prison? If you find some evidence, then I'll listen. Until then, leave this guy alone. You understand? [Joe] Kelly? We've got a rundown on this gardener. Something just doesn't jive. You said he was in his 60s, right? [Kelly] Yes. [Joe] Not according to his driver's license, business records. Ben Carter is 35 years old. [Kelly] No, that's a mistake. I double checked. See, Lieutenant? There's something really strange with this guy. Yeah, really strange. You get the evidence, I mean, evidence. Now, if you'll excuse me, alright? Benjamin Carter? Haven't heard that name in a while. So, you know him then? You don't forget a student like Benjamin. Can you tell me anything about him? Why? Is there a problem? No. It's just a routine investigation. [teacher] What do you want to know? Everything. Benjamin Carter. Yes. He was without a doubt the most brilliant student I've had in my classroom. So, I guess we're talking, botany here, right? Botany, no. That's the broad title. Actually he was specializing in plant physiology. [Kelly] Excuse me? [Mrs. Swenson] He was interested in the physiology of flowering and fruiting. Particularly in relation to the effect of day length upon the inception of flowering. Which is called, photoperiodism. And [indistinct] flower initiated hormones. [Kelly] Sorry I asked. Excuse me. Actually, Benjamin was interested in how flowers grow. He was on a mission. He was on a mission to find the perfect fertilizer to make that happen. Well, believe me. I've seen the results of his work. And he found something that works. [Mrs. Swenson] Well, I'm glad to hear that. Because he was having a difficult time. [Kelly] Why do you say that? Benjamin was different. You know. He never mixed in with the other kids. It was just work, work. Day after day. In the end he even wanted to take my key, and work at night. So, did he have a girlfriend or best friend, or-- I do not know. What about the other students? How did they react to him? Well, I mean, they're college students. But really, they're just out of high school. Kids can be cruel. They taunted him a lot. Because he was different? Well, obviously it had to do with his appearance. Yes. So, why did he look so old? I don't know. I'm not a doctor. Don't wanna comment on that. [laughs] [Kelly] What about family? He must have relatives. Well, he lived with a woman. He used to call her mother. I was never convinced that she was his mother. Strange woman. So, I assume he graduated with honors, right? Just the opposite. He dropped out. He only had one class left for graduation. That doesn't make sense after all the work you said that he put in. He didn't think he had anything left to learn. Didn’t think I could teach him anymore. [laughs] He was probably right. He was a lot smarter than I am. [peaceful music] [Mrs. Carter] I was expecting you a little earlier. Please. [indistinct] tea? Oh, no. Thank you. Cookie? No, thank you. Very much. [Kelly] Mrs. Carter, when was the last time that you saw Ben? Not since he went to the university. Maybe 12, 13 years ago. The years have gone by too quickly. Is it true that Ben is only 35 years old? It's gotten worse, hasn't it? What do you mean? Ben was born with an accelerated growth disorder. He ages anywhere from two to four times the normal rate. My God. The poor guy. How does he look? Older than you. Oh, my poor baby. Is he alright? He hasn't done anything wrong, has he? [Kelly] Why would you ask something like that Mrs. Carter Life's been hard on him. That's all. Is there something in Ben's past that I should know about? What's that supposed to mean? You got something to say about Ben, you come right out and say it. Well, I'm not really sure. But it's important for Ben, and for others that I know everything about him. He was a good baby. A beautiful baby. He was just sweetest little boy. But there's something I should tell you. I'm not his real mother. I'm his aunt. My sister was, well... irresponsible to say the least. And one day she begged me to take him from her. Just for a week or two. [Kelly] How old was he? Six. And then what happened? She was killed in a car accident. I don't think he ever forgave her for not coming back. I raised him protected him. But I couldn't shield him from the world forever. When he was old enough, he had to go to school. I couldn't protect him there. Although he yearned to belong, the other students wouldn't let him. Except one little girl named, Betsy. Ben would come home and tell me how much he loved Betsy. He said that she represented everything pure and wonderful. [Betsy] So, how did you do on the test? [Ben] It was pretty easy. You want one? [Betsy] No thanks. It was easy for you, but I had to stay up all night last night cramming for it. I would've helped ya. I know that. But it wouldn't have been fair. [Mrs. Carter] They were going on a field trip to the botanical gardens. [teacher] Ben! Come over here. There's a plant I want you to see if what we talked about last week. [Ben] Okay. I'll be right there. [Betsy] Go ahead. I'll catch up with you later. I wanna stay with you here. And I would rather that you didn't blow a chance at a really good grade. -I'll be fine. -Are you sure? I'm sure. I'll see you later. Go on. Okay. [Mrs. Carter] Betsy was the only living thing he considered more beautiful than his flowers. -Yes Ma'am. -[teacher] Here you are. [teacher] Remember we talked about spermatocytes? Yes. [indistinct] Very good. What else can you tell me? [Betsy giggling] [Betsy breathing heavily] No! [Ben screaming] No! No! [Betsy] No, Ben! Ben! No! Ben! No, Ben! No! Ben! Ben! Stop! Stop it! Oh my God! Danny? Danny? You killed him. He was trying to rape you. He wasn't raping me. He was loving me. Betsy. I love you. Oh, give me a fucking break. My mother used to say, if you talk like that, you'll never get to heaven. Oh shut up about your fucking mother! Don't ever say that about my mother! When everybody else shines you on, this is the thanks that I get. Stop it! You know what, they were all right. Every single one of them. You don't belong around normal people. You belong in a freak show! Ben. A fucking freak show! -I hate you! -No! When Ben got home, his face was bleeding from hundreds of cuts. And his clothes were torn. He was so upset. He wouldn't talk to me for days. What happened to the little boy? He didn't have any serious injuries. His parents were very upset. Although I think they should've been more concerned about their son's conduct. Was been arrested? [Mrs. Carter] Yes. And because of the way he looked, they wouldn't send him to juvenile hall. Was he convicted? [Mrs. Carter] No. He was released after we agreed to pay all the boy's medical expenses. Fortunately he was only a few credits shy of graduation. And we hired a private tutor, so he could go on. And finish up and go to college. Mrs. Carter, do you think Ben will ever resort to violence again? They just wouldn't leave him alone. That's not an answer. Well, it's the only one you're gonna get. Just because he tried to help some little tramp in high school, it doesn't mean he should have to pay for it for the rest of his life. Okay. One last question. [soft gentle music] [Kelly sighs] So, why haven't you seen Ben? It's by his choice. Not mine. He claimed that I lied to him when I told him there were women in the world that were both beautiful and pure at the same time. He said he'd always hate women. All of them. Unless he could find one that was pure. Then he could love again. Some chance in this world. This is where it all begins. Sure, I remember Ben Carter. Is the creep still alive, or did he die of old age at 20? Oh yeah he's still around. That's too bad. What do you want from me? I want you to re contact him, and get back into his life. Oh, I don't think so lady. The last time that I saw him was back in high school. And that wasn't far back enough. He's crazy, you know. Now I was led to believe that you're sweet girl. And that's exactly how I need you. Sweet. I know what happened back in high school. And I wanna see if that's gonna happen again. Then you date the weirdo. And I'm not sweet anymore, haven't you noticed? [Kelly] Oh, rough life? Listen, you're the one who fucked with his head. Now I want to get you back in there. No. No, no, no, no fucking way! There is no reason for me to get involved. Oh, there's a few reasons. But lemme just give you one. Five years. What the hell are you talking about? Well, that's how long it's gonna take for you to clear this check charge of yours. Oh, bullshit! No one ever serves any more than six months. Yeah. No one has me going to the judge, and demanding the maximum. What's in it for me? I get the judge to grant you straight probation. No time. You can do that? Are you ready to go? As ready as I'll ever be. Don't worry about a thing. As long as you're wearing that wire, I can hear everything that's going on. How do you think he'll react? I don't know. That's what I wanna find out. [Betsy sighs] I haven't seen Ben in a long time. I don't even know if you'll recognize me. Kelly sure thinks he will. Okay. Here. -Wish me luck. -Luck. [suspenseful music] Hello? Hello! [gasps] Can I help you? [laughs] Um. My um... My boyfriend is ill. And um... I wanted to see if I could get a plant to take to him. well, I think I can help you. Follow me. I think any of these should do quite nicely. They're wonderful. He must be a very special boyfriend. He has someone who cares for him so much. Do you deliver? [birds chirping] You heard, right? What did you think? -I think he looks old. -Yeah, no kidding. Did he recognize you? No, I don't think so. [sighs] You're not sure? Well, I mean, there was this one moment where he kind of hesitated. And I thought he recognized me. but then it just passed. Guess Kelly was wrong. Look, you're gonna have the hotel covered, right? Yeah, don't worry about it. Kelly will be there herself. I'm sorry, it's just... I just can still see his face. You know, the way that he looked at me when we were in the woods. I don't know man. He just gives me the creeps. [intriguing music] [knocking on door] Betsy. Betsy! Come on! Here. [Kelly] Oh shit. Don't screw his up. I'll be in here. Alright. Okay. Hi. Delivery from "Garden of Eden." Or anything else you might need. [sighs] No tip. [water bubbling] He's very smart. [Betsy] Well, maybe he just didn't recognize me. Dear Betsy. It was very nice to see you again. I van see the years have treated you kindly. I wish I could say the same for me. [laughs] Good luck in your life. Ben. He's fucking with us. Hey! I held up my end of the deal, now it's your turn to hold up yours. It's over when I say it's over. He wants to play games, we play games. You're going to invite him to dinner. [laughs] Oh goodie! [Betsy] I have a confession to make. There is no boyfriend. I just wanted to see you again. Why? I don't know. I guess to you apologize for what happened back in school. Oh. Yes, well. I thought about that day. Many, many times. You know Betsy, even though I looked older, I was still really just a kid. I forgot. Ah. I became lost after that. I was searching for a reason to live. I was searching for the ideal woman. [suspenseful music] [footsteps] You were very beautiful then. And ever since that experience, I began looking for a... for a woman with inner and outer beauty. Not very easy to find. Is that why you're still alone? No. In fact, I found someone. [Betsy] Oh, that's great! Are you with her now? [Ben] Yes. Well, can I meet her? I don't think she'd like that. Why? Does she know about our past? No. She's beautifully naive. And pure. And I'm not? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to insult you. [suspenseful music] [Betsy] Why aren't you eating? Well, I'm starting fast today. -Are you ill? -No, no, no, no. I just want to rid my body of worldly secular food. Is this a religion or a belief? Yes. Yes. You see, I have been chosen by God to create something spiritually pure and clean. Therefore, I myself, have to be spiritually pure and clean. You're talking about your flowers. Yes. Of course. [both laugh] Wow. You got big. I'm out of here. [Kelly] Anything? [Del] Of course there's something. I keep on telling everybody. There's no such thing as nothing. Oh, don't break my balls, Del. If you had balls, I would seriously reconsider my heterosexuality. Come on, Del. Just a little bit of humor. Let me see here. The stuff you gave me, is protein and faeces. Shit! Exactly. Fertilizer to be precise. That's it? So far. I still got three more bags of the shit to look through. Well, can you tell if the faeces are human or animal? Sure. Give me little more time. Alright. Get on it. It's really important. I'll be in my office. [phone ringing] [on the phone] Kelly, it's Del. [Kelly] Human or animal? Combination of both. [Kelly] Can you break it down further than that? Not with this equipment. hold on [indistinct] There was something. I did find a fingernail in one of the bags. -From which bag? -[Del] Iris. Tell me more. Well, she liked Revlon. Very bright. -[Kelly] Red? -Bingo. I also found a drop of blood. -Type A? -[Del] Two for two. Because that's Iris's blood type and her fingernail color. I bet half the chicks in L.A have type A blood, and wear red nail polish. Can you run a DNA test on that? Sure. If you can give me some samples to compare it with. I can get you some hair samples from her apartment. I'll have to send it out. It's going to take authorization. Del, this might be the break I've been waiting for. Can you just ship the damn thing out? [Del] You're such a charmer. You'll get your report. You're the best. -Love ya. -[Del] Love you too, sweetie. The search warrant covers everything. And I want everything searched! Let's not have to come back here again. Okay. Let's go! [intriguing music] Did you check everything around and back? Make sure you walk those dogs around the perimeter. Don't miss a thing. [soft gentle music] [dogs barking] I'll take care of it. [suspenseful music] [Joe] I found something. Is there any law against killing rats? [dog barking] Lieutenant. Work on some other cases, especially Jake Marshall one. [indistinct] piling up He's still at large. Probably a little pissed off that you killed his little brother. What are you talking about? I'm working on Iris's case. You know, my partner. Your partner. You're too close. [indistinct] detective. You're too close. You're off the case. Alright. Then give me a vacation. No. Alright. Then I quit. That's bullshit, Kelly! That's bullshit. And you know that. No, you're bullshit, Dean! Do I get my vacation or not? Yeah. You can have your damn vacation. Alright. [Dean] Hold on. Look. I know you. I know you're gonna stick your pretty little face where it doesn't belong. You're not gonna tell anybody you had the time. And I know that. Just stay in touch, alright? What's this? It’s just a precaution. It's just um, um... All you do is, dial star one. And you can get me any time. You're the only one who has the number. And I'll know it's you. Use it. Use it. [soft gentle music] [Kelly] So, I'm starting this stakeout. I don't know how long this is gonna take. Either way I got to prove he's responsible for Iris's disappearance. Or, if he's innocent. Either way. I got to find out. If he is the killer, then it's only a matter of time before he tries to kill again. And I wanna be there to stop him. You look beautiful today, Miss Lilly. [laughs] [Kelly] Suspect's working inside the nursery. Doesn't seem to suspect anything. [laughs] I'll give him one thing. He's fucking committed. I know you're out there, somewhere. I just wonder where you are. [suspenseful music] Well. it looks like he settled in for the night. But I can't take a chance. What if I look away for one minute. And that's when he decides to boogy out of there. What if he decides to kill somebody just because I fucked up? God. I should've had the heat turned on. [intriguing music] Shit! This could be it. [camera clicking] I've got some exotics back here. Care to look at them? You're a good customer of mine. I would love to. [Kelly] He's taking her in the back. She fits the pattern perfect. She's young. She's beautiful. How long should I wait? Fuck! He could be attacking her right now. I'm going. Shit! [tense music] Fuck! That is so incredible back in there, Ben. [indistinct] Oh fuck. Bastard! [breathing heavily] He knows I'm out here! [breathing heavily] He's fucking with me. [sighs] Don't worry my little friends. Everything eventually returns to the earth. And the worms. Well. Almost everything. [birds chirping] I wonder what she's thinking. Fuck! He's crazy! He's standing out there like a maniac. He's sitting there, laughing! He's fucking crazy! I'm into the third day. And there's absolutely no suspicious behaviour on the present suspect. [laughs] Maybe Dean was right. Maybe I'm the one who's going crazy. God knows! Maybe he is just a harmless old gardener. [calm music] [sighs] It's very peaceful. Very quiet. I think this is gonna be my last night. [sighs] I seemed to... I seem to develop a strange attraction to this guy. Sorry, Iris. [Iris] Kelly. Kelly! Iris? What the hell? Where the fuck have you been? I'm so sorry. Kelly, I'm so sorry. I know. I couldn't tell you. I couldn't tell anyone. You don't understand. Oh, my God. Iris. I thought you were chopped up and killed. -Kelly. -[Kelly] By this gardener. [Kelly sobbing] I've been sitting here for days. [shouting] Kelly! Kelly! Oh my God! [Iris] Kelly! What's going on? [Iris] Kelly! [shouting] Iris! [sobbing] [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] [Ben singing] [Ben continues singing] [loud punch] [man] Good evening. [Kelly screams] [Kelly groans] This is for my brother, you fucking bitch! Are you alright? Yeah. I think so. Where did you come from? Oh. I was just coming back to my van. From where? Just went for a walk. I guess you'd want to see what I'd thrown in the dumpster. You knew I was there? Well. I knew that you were following me. [indistinct] I must be really bad. [groans] [tense music] You're not bad. I'm just better. [Kelly sighs] [Ben] Come on. There you go. You know, I don't always understand you, Ben. But I do thank you. Well, rescuing beautiful young women in distress, is my second vocation. [Kelly laughs] Well, thank you. You're not mad at me for following you? Why would I be mad at you? I haven't done anything, have I? Not that I know of. [Ben chuckles] You know, you should've been a cop. Yeah. Perhaps. As the thought process of the criminal, has always fascinated me. Of course you know, in the movies. The bad guys always get caught. [both laugh] In real life, the bad guys always get caught. If I was a criminal, the ending would have a very different outcome. And how would it be? Come on. You can figure that one out. I'm too smart to get caught. Well, I better get going now. I can see you're gonna have your hands full with sleeping beauty here. Aha. Um, Ben. Thanks for tonight. The pleasure is all mine. Oh, by the way. I'm showing some of my collections of the flower show in the next few days. I thought you'd like to drop by. You may even enjoy it. Yeah. I'd like that. I'll call you. -[Ben] Okay. -Keep the address. Alright. Wake up. Up you go, brother. [water running] [sighs] [intriguing music] Don't worry my dear. You won't be alone much longer. [laughs] [intriguing music continues] [laughs] Well. [gasps] [panting] [screams] [panting] It's not over. [uplifting music] [people talking] [reporter] Is this your greatest creation yet? I must say that I'm very proud of it, yes. You'll notice the veins are absolutely parallel. Are three flowers the usual amount of blossom? My dear lady, an Iris is a monocotyledon. They all have three flowers. Sorry. Could you spell that, please? Yes, I could. But I won't. You'll have to look it up. It's the only way we learn. [Ben] Would you excuse me, please? [uplifting music continues] -Hi. -[Kelly] Hi. It's really nice of you to come by. Well, promise is a promise. It's really beautiful. Oh yes. Well, that's the iris. Oh, I'm sorry. Same name. Look, I'm nearly finished here. Why don't you just walk around and look at the exhibits? And I'll be out back. I've got to pack up my van. Maybe I'll see you later. I think I'll do that. Fine. Hey, um... Kelly, I'm sorry. I'm not the guy you're looking for. Part of me is. And... part of me isn't. Hi. Hi. I just came by to say I'm sorry. How charming. Well, I appreciate it. Thank you very much for the ride. It's the least I can do. Um, listen, if you've got a moment, why don't you come on in? Have a drink. I don't think so. You still have your doubts about me, don't you? Listen, what can I do to convince you, I know nothing about your friend's disappearance. I wanna be convinced, Ben. [laughs] But I don't know how you're gonna do that. Well, how about, logic, truth, compassion? Come on. I'm not as old as I look. [soft gentle music] [Kelly] You don't have much of a budget for interior design, do you? [laughs] It's a joke. I know. I like a sense of humor. [chuckles] I like being with someone who has an independent spirit. Have you been with a lot of women? More than you may imagine. [Kelly laughs] That's funny 'cause your teacher at the University seems to think that you didn't seem to socialize at all. Well, it depends on your definition of socializing, doesn't it? Well, then I only have to go by what your mother said. Or was she wrong too? It's not my mother. No. Mothers tell lies to their children. Why not aunts, hmm? How's your tea? well, did you have Betsy? Was she one of your conquests? What is the point of it? What's the point, Kelly? You're attempting to turn me into a raving lunatic. Because you confronted me with that slut! Come on. Give me all credit for that. The tea... You [indistinct] with the tea. [glass shatters] How do you feel? [indistinct] [water dripping] [panting] [suspenseful music] Shit. Shit. Shit. [panting] Oh, God. Did we enjoy our little nap? You crazy son of a bitch! That's right. You asked. Yes, like all women. Crazy. Depends on who you have to answer to. Oh my, oh my, oh my. Ooh. You really are quite beautiful. Damn you! I'm a cop! There's gonna be police [indistinct] any minute. No, I don't think so. See, I know you, Kelly. Remember? I was the one who admired your independence. So, there will be nobody. You told no one where you'll be tonight. And do you know why? I'm sure you're gonna tell me! Because you weren't sure. And the last thing you wan to do, is to run around, and make a fool of yourself. [sobs] And what do you call his? Come on. Don't be so harsh. From the very beginning, you were never a match for me. Oh, but do take some comfort from the fact that I'm going to cleanse you, [indistinct] your creator. Your death will be used to create something much more pure and beautiful. And in return, you'll be elevated to a higher [indistinct] Do me a favor, get your fucking hands off me! Is that the way you look at women, you sick fuck! [sobbing] Kelly. You must please understand, I've been chosen by God, to create a new born woman. How? By having to put your hands, your grubby hands on them? No. Through my plants. And through my flowers. [Kelly sobbing] I'm going to regrow women, purer than they were before. God. Poor Iris. Worry about Iris. I've given her a new life. And a new spirit. [sobbing] I had to preserve her beauty. And I didn't want her rotting away. [suspenseful music] [indistinct] [indistinct] [indistinct] They flash upon that inward eye. Which is the bliss. Of solitude. And then my heart, with pleasure fills. And dances. Till death do. [Kelly] [indistinct] dick bastard! What you couldn't get it on with alive girl? I trust you to see it that way. The whole world is diseased. Women are cheap! God understands. Quit blaming God! God has nothing to do with this! [suspenseful music continues] Mu studies have shown... that women's beauty, is purely physical. Not spiritual. [Kelly] You bastard. [sobs] You fucking crazy bastard. Iris joined the other beautiful women who became one with heir creator. [sobs] I'm sorry Iris. I'm so sorry. There's nothing to be sorry about. It was her awakening. She became a soul. But one with the morning [indistinct] Ben, it's not too late to get some help. Please stop this madness. [sobbing] [indistinct] is complete. I became one with every woman. They all became an integral part of me. And through me, into the soil. And into the flower. [Kelly] You killed an angel. She was an angel. [Ben] The angels are in heaven. Her lasting beauty is down here on earth. You're so wrong. Her lasting beauty was in the hearts and the minds of the people who knew her. Just like all the other women. You don't own them. You'll never own them! I don't think you understand. But Betsy did. Betsy? [screaming] No! No! No! No! No! I [indistinct] you down the garden path on that one, didn't I? She should've been a cop. What do you think? I think I'll make her into a Lilly. White or pink? You're gonna pay for this, you demented fuck! My destiny is really none of your concern. Oh, which reminds me. I have a little surprise for you. I'll be right back. Okay. Yes. Open. Open. [phone ringing] Hi this is Kelly, I can't come to the phone right now. So, shoot. [voicemail tone] Dammit! Where are you Kelly? Shit! [sighs] Here's the DNA reports. It's a match on Iris. [breathing heavily] [door opens] [panting] [Kelly groans] It's time for your rebirth. [Kelly screams] [tense music] [Kelly screams] [Ben laughs] Now, Kelly. There's only one way out. And that's through me, sweet Kelly. Where are we? Where do you think we are? Underneath my garden! [panting] Why didn't you find it in the search? Well, you nearly did. Those idiots. They thought the dogs were barking at a dead rat! Well, that was ingenious of me, wasn't it? You don't have to do this, Ben. [Ben] Oh yes. I do. [Kelly screams] [Ben screaming] [glass shattering] [tense music continues] Kelly! Hope you like it. Was built by the previous owner. A bomb shelter. It gets very confusing, doesn't it? All these tunnels. [indistinct] Not much light. Kelly? [groaning] Kelly? [indistinct] [sobbing] [screams] [indistinct] you. [Ben screams] You [indistinct] [Kelly coughs] [coughing] [sobbing] Kelly. Kelly? [tapping] Kelly! That's enough of this nonsense now! Come on. It's time! [suspenseful music] [light shatters] Shit! [knocking on door] Police! Open up! Open up! [Joe] Kelly? Kelly? Lucky, lucky, lucky. Shit! [indistinct] No, no, no. Take this. -Allow me. -Yeah, I guess you're right. One, two, three! [Joe] Hold on a second. I can't get it open. [door unlocks] Shit. [whispers] Joe? Joe? What? [indistinct] [Kelly screams] Dean! No! No! No! I know you're-- Shit! Bitch! [glass shatters] [Kelly screaming] [Ben screaming] [glass shattering] I'm gonna recreate you as a rose. Thorns and all. [Kelly screams] [gunshot] [gunshot] Dean! Dean! [sobs] Dean. Dean. [sobbing] Oh God. How did you find me? [Dean] The DNA came in. It confirmed Iris. You weren't home. I put two and two together. I owe you my life. I guess you gonna want the paperwork on your desk, first thing tomorrow morning, huh? First thing. [emotional music] [sobbing] Oh. Iris. Help me! Oh my God. Help me, Kelly! Please help me! No! No! No! Help me! [screaming]
