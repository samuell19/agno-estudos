Good morning, Marvin. Good morning, Hannah. Activate morning routine. Activated. It's December 7th, and today's weather in Seattle is a cold one. You'll need to bundle up. Sports news is next, after a song to get us in the Christmas spirit. Marvin, turn off the speakers. Speakers deactivated. Marvin, check my mail and texts. 52 new emails. Three missed calls from Lucy, two missed calls from Jason Gallagher. Marvin, schedule a call with Jason Gallagher at 3:00 PM today. Call scheduled. Hannah Morris speaking. Hannah Morris? The creator of Perfect One, North America's most popular dating app? Hey there, Sis. You know, for someone who works in tech, you're not very easy to get a hold of. Yes, I know, I'm sorry. It's been hectic. Christmas is our busiest time of year, everyone's looking for love, and I just have to make sure the database doesn't crash. So, without you, love could be lost? The pressure. Speaking of looking for love, how is Jonathan? It's Jason. Close enough. He's great. We have date number 10 this weekend. Wow, 10? You must really like this one. Yeah, I do, I do. He's... He's smart, he's successful, he's organized. Always on time. He's got all the things on my list. He sounds like the male version of you. What does he do again? Stock market? Financial analyst? He works at a private equity firm. Right. Sounds thrilling. You know, I can actually hear your eyes rolling? So listen, I'm only going to ask you this one more time. Are you absolutely sure you can't come home for Christmas? Dad would really love to see you. It's been years since you spent the holidays in Jackson. Hang on, I was there two years ago. For, like, 12 hours! We miss you. She really means it, I swear. You know I would love to see you guys so much, I just... I have to stay close to the office in case something goes wrong. But, a... as soon as things slow down, I'll come out and see you, okay? Okay. It's just sometimes, it feels like... you intentionally avoid coming home. What!? What's wrong, are you okay? I'm sorry, I gotta go, this is a... a work emergency. We dropped again? For the third month in a row? This is our most popular time of year! Could... could the new report be wrong? I'm afraid not. I was hoping we would have an upswing, with it being Christmas and all, but... We are officially in trouble. No one is falling in love on Perfect One. And word is spreading. Fast. That can't be right. I designed the algorithm to match people with their perfect companion based on an extensive personality test, birth order, economic status, everything! I've been reading our user feedback all morning, and people are sick of the lack of romance involved in online dating. I guess people want to fall in love the old-fashioned way. How? At a speakeasy? This is the 21st century, for crying out loud. That's what you need to figure out. Why just me? You're the creative brains behind this whole operation. I'm business and sales. And you create. Okay. Naomi, we can't let this happen. We built this company from nothing. It's already happening. And it's only gonna get worse; we need to start thinking about a total rebrand to come out of this alive. Okay. Okay, I, I will re-examine the algorithms, I'll make 'em better, more precise. What if we need to take a step back from the numbers, and focus on understanding the spark. The spark. What is that, like a new software program? No! The spark. You know, when we meet someone, and it just feels like everything is magic? It's the moment we realize we're starting to fall in love. That's what people wanna feel. Especially at Christmas-time. And Perfect One doesn't have that. Have you ever been in love? Yeah. It was forever ago. So... Before smartphones? Yes. Exactly. You have to find a way to blend the traditional and sentimental ways of falling in love... with modern technology. Okay. I will stay late every night. So, what you need is to get away from the office and get inspired again. I'm sorry, a... away from the office? It's almost two weeks until Christmas. Take that time to spend more of it with Jason. I'll stay here and manage the PR and the budget cuts. Go find that spark. Jason! It's Hannah, again. We need to talk? Can you just, just call me back? When you get a chance. Soon? Please? Thank you. Okay. Bye. Incoming email from Jason Gallagher. Yes. Good. Good, good, good, good! "Dear Hannah, I got your messages. "I know you don't like long, drawn out emails, "so I will keep this short. "This just isn't working." What? "I'm sorry. "I can't be in a relationship that lacks any real connection. "I might as well be dating a robot "with all of the automated messages I get from you. "I wish you all the best, but we just aren't right together. "Merry Christmas, Jason." Did I just get dumped via email? Okay. Okay, who else can I spend time with? Let me see, let me see, let me see. Okay, let's see, let's see. Mike. He's a little clingy... Jeremy! The weird eyebrow thing happening. Come on... Chad. Yeah, Chad was nice. He was good. Okay. Marvin. Call Chad. Calling dad. No. No, no! Chad! Marvin, hang up. Call Chad! Hello? Hi dad! Hannah! I'm so glad you called. I feel like I haven't talked to you in ages. How's work? Saving the world, one set of lovebirds at a time? Not exactly. Things are not going super well at work right now, to be honest. I'm sorry to hear that. But you'll turn it around, you always do. I'm not so sure this time. Does Naomi have you working over the holidays? Not anymore. Well now, wait a minute. Does that mean you can come home for Christmas after all? No! No! That's not... Great! It'll be like old times again. I'll get your room ready. Wait, hold on. Dad, I... I... Can't wait! Your sister will be thrilled. Hannah! Dad! I told you not to wait up! I was too excited to sleep. Welcome home. Where are all the decorations? Normally you have them up by November 1st. It's just me in the house. It seemed a bit silly. Not even a tree? You love decorating a tree. It's your favourite tradition. Well, sometimes, you have to let go of the past, and Lucy and Joe always invite me over to decorate theirs anyway, huh? Come on, get this stuff upstairs. You must be tired. There we go. Some things never change. A lot of happy memories. It's late. I'll let you unpack. Glad to have you home. Goodnight, dad. See you in the morning, Sweetheart. Okay. Marvin. Close the blinds. Marvin. Please close blinds. Marvin! Yeah. Good morning. Good morning! How'd you sleep? Fine. That, mattress could use a little upgrade though. Hey, what's the WiFi password here again? I should've told you. I got rid of the internet a few months ago. Are you serious? Well, what can I say? An accountant always looks where he can save a buck. Plus, I've got it at work. Why do you need the internet all the time? To check my email? The news? Social media? Bank account? Number of steps I've taken? Number of hours I've slept? I could go on. I'm surprised you know how to breathe without it. Okay. Where's the coffee maker? About that. I went to that new doctor in town about stomach pains, and he suggested I quit. So... there's no internet or coffee? I'm sorry, honey. I have lots of tea! No, it's... it's fine, I'll just... go to a cafe in town after breakfast and get some coffee. Check my email. While you're out, would you mind, mailing some Christmas cards for me? So you're still writing out all those cards to everyone? Some traditions I just can't seem to let go of. You know, if you had WiFi, I could set up your email so that a virtual Christmas card goes out to everyone automatically every year. It would save you a ton of time. You know, snail mail really is a thing of the past, dad. There's more to life than increasing its speed. Come on. Thanks dad, this looks great. Well, your mom's old recipe. So, how are things going with the new guy you're dating? Well, he broke up with me actually. In an email. No. I'm sorry. You deserve better than that. It's fine. We weren't really working, anyway. Do you ever think about meeting someone new? Putting yourself out there again? I wouldn't even know where to start! Well, I could get you a smartphone. And then, you could sign up for Perfect One. I'm sure there are tons of women out there that would love to spend time with you. You're a total catch! I'm too old school for that techie stuff. Besides, I'm fine as I am. Are you? Of course! I have a good life. I have two beautiful daughters, and the most wonderful grandson. Don't you worry about me. Can I help you? Grande mocha frappuccino, hold the whip. And the WiFi, please? Is that order a joke? Hannah. Sam. You're home! You're here. I own the place. I... It's, it's very vintage. Yeah, I took it over five years ago. Figured I'd keep it the same way. How nostalgic of you. Well, if it ain't broke, why fix it? To improve things. Keep up with the 21st century. How are... how are you? How are... how are your parents? They're just a couple of snowbirds now. They spend the winters down south. Are you gonna go down and see them over the holiday? Got a business to run. I'm sure you can remember I wasn't exactly Mr. Christmas. Right. Right. Speaking of Mr. Christmas, how is your dad? I haven't seen him for a few weeks. He's good. He actually seems a little lonely. Kinda wish he'd meet someone new, it's been so long since... Yeah. Look, I'm... I'm sure he'll find someone when he's ready. You can't rush these things. I updated the inventory. We are all stocked up. Thanks, Julie. Did... did I interrupt something? No. - No. - No. Julie, Th... this is Hannah. We... went to high school together. She's the reason I passed physics. So, you knew Sam back in high school? I bet all the girls had a crush on him. Something like that. I, gotta go! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hey, didn't you want a... coffee? Aunt Hannah! Max! Oh, my goodness, you're a giant! How did you get so big? How are you? Good. I just signed up for Christmas Cupid! I've never heard of it, but that sounds amazing. I can't believe you're really here! How'd you know where to find me? Dad called me. Also, everyone knows Hannah Morris can't go more than two minutes upon waking without her caffeine fix. You, my dear, have a problem. By the way, speaking of which, thanks for telling me that Sam now owns the cafe downtown! It's exactly the kind of thing I was hoping to avoid. Yikes. Awkward small-talk with an ex? The past. Was it weird to see him? No, we broke up when I was a sophomore in college. I mean, we were kids. It was like the Mesozoic era. You were alive with the dinosaurs? Cool! Yes, I was. You didn't answer my question. Okay, fine. Next topic. Dad invited us over for lunch today. He's so excited to have you home. It... it's making me question who his favourite really is. Does he seem kind of lonely to you? He hasn't even put up any decorations. I know, but what do you expect? He lives alone and spends all of his time at the office. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. What's that mean? Mom, can we go to the candy store now? You promised. Yes, yes I promised. Do you want to come with us? I just have to drop off a couple Christmas cards for dad at the post office first, but then, I will meet you back at the house, okay? See you there, sis! Hannah Morris! What a pleasant surprise! Mrs. Monroe! I haven't seen you since I taught 12th grade English. And please, call me Martha. I didn't know you worked here. You bet, ever since I retired from the high school. What can I do for you today? Yeah, I just need to get some stamps for these. You interested in signing up for the town's Christmas Cupid? My nephew was just talking about that. What is it, exactly? Well, it's an old Christmas tradition the town used to do during the Second World War. Strangers would write to each other in the hopes of either forming a deep friendship, or better yet, falling in love. All you have to do is sign up, and I connect you with a secret pen pal. Match-making's my specialty. Pen pal, huh? Yup. Then all the letters have to be delivered either to that mailbox over there, or the red one outside. And I'll make sure all the letters get to the right house. That seems like quite a bit of hassle when it's so much easier just to meet someone online. Well, you'd be surprised how many people prefer to write letters. Half the town signed up. So, why did the tradition stop? Well, during the war, the post office made sure that letters were delivered very quickly. It was the only way loved ones could keep in touch. But once the war ended, using the phone became cheaper, more efficient, and more modern. A little too modern if you ask me. This could be perfect. Great! I'll get you a signup sheet. No, no, no. No, not for me, no. For my dad. Can I run home and bring him back? Of course, but today's the last day to sign up. Okay. I will be back. Thanks, Mrs. Monroe. Martha! Thanks for waiting. Dad! Yup? Hey! So, you have to sign up for Christmas Cupid. It is the perfect way for you to meet someone new. Hello to you, too. Joe. Hi! Good to see you! Is that that pen pal thing everyone keeps talkin' about at the office? Yes, exactly! You are such a great writer. Aren't pen pals for kids? No! Liz, would you just tell dad that he has to sign up for the Christmas Cupid thingy? I signed up, Grandpa! Maybe we'll be pen pals! I think it's a great idea. See? For you. What? For me? Now that I can get on board with. Okay. Nice try. But... no! I need to spend every waking moment trying to save Perfect One. Naomi needs me to focus on researching old fashioned ways of falling in love that are both timeless and sentimental. No. For... for other people! Not for me! Besides, I don't, I don't even wanna meet someone new. I just got dumped. So... Technically, you're not meeting them. You're just writing to them. Yeah. Okay, you know what, this whole thing was supposed to be about dad? So, I'm not quite sure what's happening. Why don't you both sign up? Brilliant! Really? Now that seems fair to me. The only way I will sign up is if you do, too! You serious right now? Do we have a deal? You know what, it might actually be good for research purposes. So, okay, fine. That's the only reason I'm doing it. Well, looks like Christmas just got a lot more interesting. Boy, I'll say! Yeah. Here you go! You're back! Nice to see you, Teddy. You too, Martha. Somehow, my daughters have convinced me to sign up for this Christmas Cupid affair. Well, I think that's splendid. I'll get you a signup sheet. And one for my Hannah here, too. Delightful! You're just in time. The first letters are gonna arrive tomorrow. And after you finish signing up, something sweet to say thank you. All right. Woo! Now, the first rule is, every letter has to be handwritten. No computers, phones, gizmos or gadgets allowed. But typing is so much faster. Speed is not the goal here! Music to my ears! And the second rule is, you have to come up with a pen name. A fake name? Why? The experience will be so much richer if you don't know who you're writing to. Plus, on Christmas Eve, there's a Christmas Cupid festival, where everyone will finally reveal their true identities to one another. It's gonna be so fun. Try to think of a name that reminds you of a special Christmas memory. How about Bing? White Christmas was a favourite of ours, wasn't it, Hannah? Yeah, we used to watch it every year. Great choice. How about you, Hannah? Stardust. Here goes nothin'. Hey, dad? Yeah? Do you remember how your parents fell in love? I do, why do you ask? I'm just trying to figure out how people from their generation met. Well, it was an ice cream parlour. Dad worked there, and she came in every... every Tuesday for a root beer float. Eventually, he mustered up enough courage to ask her to a movie. That, and an extra scoop of ice cream sealed the deal. I'm guessing you don't know how mom's parents met? I wish I did. But your mom was too young when they died. I would have loved to have met them. Yeah, me too. Ooh. Hey! Hey! Look what I just found! That did not take long. One for Bing. And one for Stardust. What is hangin' off of these letters? It looks like an invitation to something. Yes! "Welcome to the First Annual Christmas Cupid. "Since 1945. "All participants are invited to a free skate "at the local arena tonight at 6:00 P.M. "Come for a chance to brush shoulders "with your new pen pal." Well, I haven't skated since, sixth grade? So, yeah. Count me out. Hey, nice try! We're in this together, remember? Well, in her defence, she's possibly the worst skater in the country. Yeah, that's... That's my point exactly. A deal's a deal, kiddo. Come on, read your letters already. Okay. All right. "Dear Stardust: I must confess "that I almost didn't write this. "I've never been good with words, "and don't really know why I signed up in the first place. "Martha somehow convinced me. "She said that Christmas is a magical time of year, "and anything is possible if we truly believe. "I think that I could use a little bit of Christmas magic "these days. "Look forward to hearing from you. Hutch." So? He spelled "believe" wrong. What kind of a person doesn't know that it's "i before e, except after c?" This was such a bad idea. Give him a break, Judge Judy. No one is perfect. What about you, dad? How was your letter? She sounds very interesting. She has recently taken up painting. I mean honestly, did Martha set me up with a second grader? Give it a chance, Hannah. You never know what surprises will come out of this. Spellcheck was invented for a reason. Honey! Are you okay, Aunt Hannah? Yep, good, just figuring it out. It's gonna be great. It's gonna be great. Welcome, welcome! I'm so glad you came. Thanks, Martha. Hannah! Are you okay? Fine! Fine. Good. Look! It's the Mayor. Have fun! Well, if it isn't the Morris gang! What a pleasant surprise! Susan, great to see ya. Hey, Susan. Hannah, I haven't seen you for years. You are looking more and more like your mother! She was a little bit better on skates. Isn't this great? I swear, the whole town is here. Martha, she sure knows how to bring people together. Does she ever! This is really something. How are the kids? They're great. Nicole is in Mexico with her family for the holidays, and Simon is still finishing up his degree in France. Fantastic. You must be proud! I should really introduce you to the ladies from my book club. They are gonna be so excited that you signed up for Christmas Cupid. What'd I tell ya? They're just over there, on the other side of the rink. Okay. I'll meet you over there. I'm just waiting for Hannah, here. No, no, no. I'm fine, I'm fine! You go! I'll... I'll catch up. Are you sure, Honey? Yes! Go, go. Get outta here. Get outta here. Okay. Okay... I'll just... go... I can do this. Yeah. I got this, I got... Ouch! Hannah Morris on skates. I never thought I'd see the day. Sam. What are you doing here? Don't tell me you signed up for Christmas Cupid. I'm just serving hot chocolate as a favour for Martha. Okay. Did... you sign up? I... I'm doing it for research. Plus, also, my dad refused to do it unless I did, so... Yeah. I can't imagine having to write a new letter every other day for the next two weeks. Sounds... Stressful. What are you talking about? You used to be a great letter writer. Back in the day. I think I still have a few of those, somewhere. Well, I knew extortion was somewhere in my future. So, who do you think he is? I don't know. Honestly, I wish I hadn't signed up. I just want the next two weeks, and Christmas, and anything to do with it over with. That does not sound like the same girl that once dragged me carolling while wearing a lit-up Christmas sweater. Well... You know, some things change. I'm gonna go check on my dad and Max. See you later! Try to have fun. Okay! Sh- Hannah! - You okay? - You okay? That was a hard fall. Here, let me help you up. Thank you. Ouch. That's a good one. Yeah. Is she okay, Dan? You two know each other? Yeah. I'm a regular at the cafe. Hey, hey, Sam, would you mind finding us a bandage? Thank you... I'm Daniel Harrison, by the way. Local MD. And you are? I'm, Hannah Morris. Local... figure skating champ. I will be signing autographs later. In case you're interested! Well, Hannah Morris, you might wanna think about taking some skating lessons. Doctor's orders. You must be the new doctor that told my dad to stop drinking coffee. What, Ted? Yeah! Guilty as charged. I... I just moved here a few months back from Chicago. Took over Doctor Tucker's practice. Chicago? It's kind of a small town for a big city guy. Well, my sister and her husband live here, so it makes sense. Get to see my niece anytime I want, now. It's nice to be close to family. But with how much I work, I don't really get a chance to meet anyone outside the office. Which is why I signed up for Christmas Cupid. You signed up for this? Yeah! Why do you think I'm here? I don't know, for like... ice skating Emergencies? Technically, I'm supposed to be off duty. Sorry about that. Here you go. Thanks Sam. Perfect. Actually, I'm pretty excited about it. It's such a unique way to meet someone new. Secretly, I can't wait 'til she writes me back. I dropped my first letter off last night. Really? I just got my first letter this morning. I should get back to the stand. What? Yeah, okay. Great. Thank you! Looks like you're gonna be okay. Okay. Thank you. Hannah! Sarah? Sarah! Hi! It's been so long! Are you okay? I saw you fall from across the rink! Yeah, well, thanks to Doctor Harrison over here, I think I'm gonna live. Daniel is a lifesaver. Sarah and I went to high school together. I haven't seen you since... When? My 21st birthday bash. I think I should let you two catch up. It was really nice to meet you, Hannah. You too. Put ice on that tonight, okay? Okay! Got it. Isn't he great? I have never been so grateful to be so bad at skating in my entire life. How are you? How are you? What's been going on? Good! Good. I moved back here a few years ago, got a job teaching fourth grade. Yeah, Max is in my class! What? Yeah, but, okay, how about you? Sounds like you've been busy hanging out with Mark Zuckerberg? And doing TED talks? Your life sounds amazing. I actually went on a few dates with a guy that I met on Perfect One. Really? Yeah, it's just, you know, it didn't really work out. Like, it... We didn't really have that... Spark? Exactly. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited about this, though. Yeah, I've skated around the rink five times already. Trying to see who my pen pal could be! Do you really think it's possible to fall in love through a letter with a total stranger? Why not? It's like Martha said: "anything can happen at Christmas." Even falling in love. Oh. Okay. Dear Hutch, thank you for your letter. Like you, I thought about not going through with this. Sometimes the Christmas season can be hard for me. It used to be my favourite time of year, especially decorating the tree with my family. But now, things are different. Really different. We don't even have a tree this year. However, I'm beginning to wonder if perhaps Martha is right. Maybe there is still some Christmas magic left to be found. I just don't know where to look. Any suggestions? Look forward to your reply. Stardust. Finally! Hey, Naomi. Yeah, sorry, I've been trying to stay on top of my emails, but my dad just gave up his WiFi. So, how is everything? Our numbers are still continuing to dip. We lost 3,000 users just this week alone. Our... our investors are threatening to pull out. You've gotta be kidding me! How long do we have? If we don't have a solution by the new year, it's bad, Hannah. Have any brilliant ideas landed in your lap? Not unless you consider a letter from a stranger "brilliant." Come again? I signed up for my hometown's Christmas Cupid, which is this old tradition from the '40s where people are matched with anonymous pen pals in the hopes of finding friendship or falling in love. It's all pretty ridiculous, but I thought it might be good for research. Sounds fascinating. I... I'm intrigued. Is it working? Well, I don't really even know anything about the guy. But I am holding his second letter in my hand as we speak. Well, open it! Read what it says. I don't know. Come on. Okay, all right. Okay. All right. Okay. Here goes. "Dear Stardust" That's my pen name. "I understand what you're feeling. "Sometimes we romanticize our past so much "that we can't enjoy the present. "So let's try to change that. "I challenge you to get a Christmas tree and decorate it "with your loved ones, whoever they are. "It might feel different than it did before, "but maybe somewhere in that old tradition, "Christmas magic still lives." He sounds so sweet! So, when you gonna go? Go where? To get a tree? No, I don't know. It's a... it's a nice thought, but I'm... But what? This Christmas pen pal cupid whatever thing may be just the inspiration you've been needing. You gotta go with it. Okay. Okay. But I have to wait 'til my dad gets home from work. Unless... Unless I surprise him with one. Now you're thinking. Hannah Morris? Greg. Greg Williams, hey! If it isn't the high school valedictorian before my very eyes. How are you? I didn't know you still lived here. I am actually just in town for the holidays. I live in New York now. Really? Yeah. I work at Frank and Oak Real Estate. You're looking at one of the top ten real estate agents in the city! That's very impressive. Thank you. I thought I saw you at the skating rink. Wait. You signed up for Christmas Cupid too? Yeah. Mrs. Monroe... Martha. Martha, right. Martha. She basically forced me to when I ran into her. Yeah, sounds about right. Listen, I mean, I gotta run. Do you... do you want to grab a cup of coffee while we're both in town and catch up? Sure. Great. Call me. Okay! All right. - See ya. - See ya. Okay. Tree, tree. Yeah. This is the one. Hi! Hi. Excuse me? Can... can I get this tree? Sure. You just use one of the carts over there and bring it to your vehicle. Wait, you don't... You don't deliver? Good one. Thanks, Julie. Say, Sam, when are you gonna get some new options in this place? I'd pay good money for a pumpkin spice latte. Yeah, that must take a lot of courage, to say that out loud. Trust me, Mike, I've been telling him that for months. What's the saying? "Stubborn as a mule" or "dumb as a doorknob?" I think they both work. You still on for hockey tonight? Starts at 7:00. Don't be late. I'll be there when I get there. Hey Spencer, what's up? Hey Julie. I'm good, how are you? I'm- I... I mean, not much. Not much. Not much is up. I'm good. Are... are you good? I... I'm... I'm good. Good. Good. Good, good, good, good. Did you want anything, or? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sure. I'll... I'll take that. The pink butterfly cupcake? Yup. It's for my sister. You have a sister? How much would that be? $3.00. Okay. Well, hey. Keep the change. Thanks. Okay. Good. Okay. Bye. He has a serious crush on you. Who? Spencer? He's just awkward. No way. I know someone who was just like him. You? Almost passed out every time I tried to talk to the girl I liked. I ended up having to stick a note in her locker in 11th grade, just to ask her to a movie. Did she go out with you? Quite a few times. We ended up dating for almost four years. Four years? How have you never told me this? The point is, don't be so quick to brush him aside. Who was she? Forget it, you're not listening. Someone I know? Stop. Was she pretty? She was- Hannah! It was Hannah? Would you go fill some mugs or something? Large coffee, black. Should I even ask? I was trying to surprise my dad with a Christmas tree, but I don't have a car. It was the perfect tree. No, it's on the house. Thanks. I... have my truck. I could take you. Seriously? Wait, now? As opposed to? Aren't you working? You know, Julie's here. Hey Julie? Yes? Can you hold down the fort for a bit? I'm gonna help Hannah with something. As you wish. Ooh, could you drop off my Christmas Cupid letter on your way? Fine. Are you sure? Well, you can't give up on the perfect tree just because of a bump in the road. Now, let's go before I change my mind. You too. Looks great. You picked a beauty. My dad is gonna be so excited. Thank you so much, Sam. I could not have done this without you. I owe you one. How about one of your mom's famous apple pies? I think I could find that recipe somewhere. Never in a million years did I think that when I came home, I'd be buying a Christmas tree, or writing to a Christmas pen pal. How's that going, by the way? He seems really... sweet, actually. It feels like he's listening to me. Says the girl who wished she never signed up? Yeah, well, I'm trying to give it a chance. Well, don't get too excited. You could be writin' to Principal Cullen for all you know. I saw him at the rink. What? That's so gross! Remember how much nose hair he had? Yes! And how it connected to his moustache? Yes! Well, it still does, but... Hey, maybe he's the one. Love knows no bounds, after all. It "nose" no bounds. Okay, that's just a terrible joke. You should never say that again. Can you... You know, you need to stop! Right now. Forget I mentioned it. Hey! Is that Sam I see? What a surprise! Ted. A tree! It's the perfect tree! Well, you know, I figured we hadn't decorated in a long time. I thought maybe we could do it tonight. Unless you threw out all the decorations. Threw out? I don't think so. Come on, Max, let's go find them. Well, I should get going. Yeah. Hey, thanks again for today, Sam. Glad I could help. Sam, you should come back later to decorate with us. Yeah? I... I don't know... He did help bring it in. Only seems right that you should get to help decorate it, too. I mean, unless you're too much of a Scrooge to participate in something so merry and jolly. Alright, count me in. This might be our best tree ever! It definitely beats the year a live squirrel jumped out. It practically gave mom a heart attack. Just like that movie. We had to chase it around the house. We? I think you mean Sam. He chased that thing with an old pot and saved the day! Come on. It's a true story. We have to give Joe some credit here. He screamed every time that thing ran by, so at least I knew where it was, right? You're my hero. Why thank you! It really is perfect. Not yet. We're missing the star! Would you like to do the honours, Mr. Max? Really? Cool! Come on, Joe. Give me a hand with this guy, here. All right, ready? One, two, up we go! Good guy! All right, you got it, man. Hannah? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry. What's wrong? It's nothing. It's... it's stupid. Is this about Max putting the star on top of the tree? I know that used to be your mom's job. You remember that? She is hard to forget. It just doesn't... It doesn't feel right without her. This whole Christmas season just makes me miss her more than I can bear. It's too much. You know, the way I see it, continuing old traditions you used to do with your mom will only help keep her alive in your heart. Just because you added a twist to the tradition, it doesn't erase the past. She would love to see Max putting the star on top of that tree. It would break her heart to see you avoiding the Christmas season just because she isn't here. I know. I know, you're right. I just thought that I would be over this by now. It's been so many years. I'm just tired of feeling sad. Well, sometimes it doesn't matter how much time goes by. We can still miss someone with our whole heart. And that's okay. It just means we love them fully. When did you get so smart? I know what it's like to miss someone. Come see the tree, it's all done! Come on! Okay, I promised your mom we were just looking today, so don't try to trick me into buying you anything. Hey, look, it's Doctor Harrison! Hey! Well, if it isn't my favourite figure skater? How's the wrist? It's good, it's good. Thanks for asking. Good. Hey, Max, good to see you again, buddy! This is Lizzie, my niece. Hey, Lizzie! Did you find anything interesting in here yet? I'll show you! Come on! I miss it sometimes. Just being a kid, getting so excited by everything. And what made a nine-year-old Doctor Harrison fill up with excitement? Dreaming of becoming a doctor. Really? You... you knew you wanted to be a doctor from the age of nine? I was six, actually. I guess I just always knew what I wanted. I... I think that's an incredible quality to have. Did you accomplish everything? Almost. There's just one thing left. Yeah, what's that? To find someone. The one. And, if Martha is as good a cupid as she says she is, I think it's my pen pal. I've got a good feeling about it. Really? Even though you have no idea who you're writing to? Who knows? Maybe she's standing right next to me. Hannah. Hey, Martha. Or, should I say, Stardust? How can I help ya? I just came by for some stamps. How's it going with your Christmas pen pal so far? You happy you signed up? Yeah, he seems great. I just... can't really wrap my brain around the whole concept of falling in love through letters. It seems a little far-fetched. How come? Anything's possible at Christmas. Plus, look at all the couples that ended up together in 1945. I found this digging through the archives at the library. "Margaret James and Thomas Floyd "married three months after Christmas Cupid." "Jill Hartwick and Hal Bradford." These are... these are my mom's parents! You're kidding? "The two began writing right before Hal went off to war, "and it wasn't until the following Christmas "when he was discharged that they finally met in person. "They married two weeks later and quickly became pregnant "with their only daughter." That's my mom! This, this is incredible. I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for Christmas Cupid. I told you. Writing letters is magical. So, hold on. First, you didn't even want to sign up. And now you're telling me that you think he could be your soulmate? Do you have any idea who it could be? No! I have no idea. It could be Doctor Daniel. Or maybe even Greg Williams. Did I tell you I ran into him the other day? Apparently, he's very successful. And you know how I love a good work ethic. Mail! Ooh! Okay. Okay. Here, here! Well, what does it say? Hang on, hang on, hang on. "Dear Stardust, to help you on your quest to finding "the magic of Christmas again, I've drawn you a special map. "If followed correctly, "you will find a Christmas treasure at the end. "Can't wait to read your next letter. "Thinking of you often." He drew you a map? He drew me a map! I think we're supposed to go through the gate. Okay, if you say so. 'Cause we just came through here. Okay. Excellent. You go. You go! You go! Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, I think we just keep going down this- This guy better not be the Zodiac Killer or something. Don't say that, he's not the Zodiac! You don't know that! Hannah! Look! Okay! What am I supposed to be looking for? There's an arrow! No, no, no! I'm not putting my hand in there. Hang on. I think I feel something. Oh god. Please don't be someone's big toe inside. Stop it! Okay. Please, please, please. Okay. Here. It's so cute! "Found these at an antique store and thought of you. "I can't explain why. "Apparently, they are over 60 years old and were inspired "by a wonderful old book called The Christmas Star." "I hope you like them. Hutch." Did you tell him about the book? No! God, I think I just felt it! What? The spark! Dear Hutch. What you did for me today meant so much. More than you could possibly understand. I will forever cherish those earrings, and whenever I wear them, I will remember the feeling that you gave me today. Thank you. You are more than I could have wished for. What are you doing up so late? Making Christmas Cupid cookies. Christmas Cupid cookies? Who blackmailed you? Well, since everyone in town was participating in the thing, I figured it would be good for business. Which... I could use right about now. I can relate to that. Really? Your company, it... Yeah. We've been taking a turn for the worse. I may be back to waitressing, come New Years'. Yeah. Hey, I've heard the tips are great. Have you ever, like, thought about getting WiFi in here? Or, you know, like setting up a rewards point program to give customers incentives to keep coming back? No way! This place would lose its soul with that stuff. You know, someone once told me that just 'cause you add a new twist to an old tradition doesn't mean you're erasing the past. Really? Kay, well, he sounds like a doofus. A... a doofus? Really? Yeah, that's a... That's a thing I say. It's a good word. More grown men should use that word. Right. These look amazing. Yeah, I just need to finish with the icing now. Well, put me to work. Okay. Be my guest. Great. They are so delicious. Thank you. And thanks for helping. It's actually an old family recipe. I just added marshmallow for texture. Wait, so like, you added something new into an old recipe, and it made it better? That's so weird! Okay. Okay. Look, I get your point. I just don't want to see this cafe turn into some hipster place where everyone's wearing their headphones, and they're more focused on their apps than they are on each other, you know? Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. No, no, no, no, no. It's totally fine. I am starting to understand the importance of really... really connecting with people, face to face. Instead of, just... you know? Through our devices. But I do think that technology can do a lot to bring people together. Yeah. That's totally true. I mean, what would we do without viral cat videos? I don't even know. I don't know either. So, you have anyone in your life these days? Sort of. I'm... I'm getting to know someone, but... yeah. It's nothing serious. Anyone I know? I doubt it. Look, it's... it's complicated. Um, anyway, how's your Christmas pen pal? He's actually... pretty amazing. Wait... are you falling for this guy? I don't know. Maybe? I think so, I don't know. Look. Remember what I said? Don't get your expectations too high. I'd hate to see you get let down. He's already surpassed my expectations. He's helping me understand what I used to love about Christmas. I haven't enjoyed this time of year since... Since my mom died. Must be midnight. I better go. Yeah. Goodnight, Sam. 'Night. Hannah? Yeah? You still owe me your mom's apple pie. Right. One at a time, folks! One at a time! Let's keep the casualties to a minimum. This isn't Black Friday! Hannah! Hey, Sarah! This is insane. People are really into this! No kidding! Between you and me, I kinda think my guy might be Daniel. He is a hot commodity around here. Who are you hoping for? I want it to be Sam. Sam? He's not doing it. But he was at the ice rink. He was selling hot chocolate, but he never actually signed up. Sorry. But, you know, that shouldn't stop you from getting to know him. I mean, just 'cause he's not your pen pal doesn't mean you can't, like, ask him out. Really? Yeah. You wouldn't mind? What? No! No, we're like, ancient history. Cool! Thanks Hannah. Sure! I'll talk to you later. 'Kay. Hey, Jeff, how's it going? Daniel! Hannah! What a nice surprise! What are you doing here? I was just out shopping, I saw you come in, I thought I'd come say hi. I'm glad you did. Please, take a seat. I'll take your coat for you. Thank you. How's your wrist? Much better, thanks. Yeah. It's so funny you're here, I was just thinkin' about you. Really? Yeah, this whole Christmas Cupid thing just has my head spinning. Yeah, you're not the only one. And, I was thinking about how... Hold that thought. The pager. Okay. Ahh, shoot. I... I'm sorry, I gotta go. Work calls. We'll finish this conversation soon, okay? Sure. It was nice to see you. You too. As short as it was. Oh my gosh! So, Sam shoots the 8 ball, it bounces off of the pool table, and smacks me right in the mouth. I lose two teeth! No! It was hilarious. One time when I was in college, we were playing pool, and Sam actually broke the TV with a cue. No, no, not the pool cue. It was actually the cue ball, right off the break, just Bam! Remind me to never play pool with him. You want another drink? You gonna leave me with these two clowns? Yeah, good point. Come with me. Okay. Can we get another round, please? This is fun. Yeah. I'm... I'm really glad you're here. Me too. Hey Sam! What? Would you look at that? Kiss her! What? What are we, in seventh grade? Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! It's just a kiss, right? Yeah, right. Right. Okay. Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! Thank you. The cookies sold well yesterday. I saw that. I'll have to tell Hannah. She helped me out with the icing. Hannah? When? A few nights ago, she popped in. Ooh la la! No. It's not like that. We're just old friends. Come on. You can tell me. I can keep a secret. There's nothing to tell. Besides, she's this big city tech whiz now. Sam, you own a business. That's... that's a big deal. On top of that, you can cook and bake? Any woman would be lucky to date you. Okay. Now I know you've lost it. Well, hey Sarah, what can I get you? I'm not here for coffee, actually. Oh really? Can I help you with something? Well. I was talking to Hannah. I had mentioned to her that I was interested in getting to know you better, and, she encouraged me to ask you out sometime. Hannah told you to ask me out? I was thinking maybe we could grab a drink tonight at Winston's? It's... it's okay if you... don't. No, no, no! The cafe doesn't close 'til 9:30. And then I have to count the... I... I'm... I'm closing tonight. Remember, Sam? He would love to go out tonight. Really? What time can I pick you up? Hey guys! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! How do you spell "triceratops?" You know what? Just sound it out and see where you land. I'm gonna get the dictionary. This needs to be perfect. He seems to be enjoying his pen pal. What are you doing here? Do you think it's cheating if you're forming a relationship with someone you've never met, but then you accidentally kiss someone else? What? Who did you kiss? Kinda... Sorta... Sam? What?! How did this happen? Sit down! Tell me! I went to the bar to spend time with Daniel, but then he had to go, so then I wound up with Sam and his friends, and there was this whole, like, mistletoe situation and it all happened so fast. It didn't mean anything. Are you sure? Yes! I'm sure, yeah. Plus, I'm really trying to give my Christmas pen pal a shot here. I am just worried that Sam might think that it meant something. I do owe him one of mom's apple pies, so I'll make a pie, I'll bring it over, we'll have a talk. Do you want the recipe? Yeah. Yeah! Do you have it? Yeah. It's in the cupboard. In mom's old recipe book. Hey, Julie, is Sam here? Sorry, he left early to go out tonight. Go out? Where? With who... with who? With Sarah. They're going to Winston's! Sarah? She didn't waste any time. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good. Yeah. I brought this for Sam, but I can bring it back another time. It's fine. Not necessary. I can just give it to him. Oh... 'Kay. Ooh! Thank you. That... works too. Hannah! Hi, Greg! I was gonna get a cup of coffee. You want to join me? Yes. Yes. I would... I would love to. But I, you know, actually, I'm just thinking, it's kind of late for coffee. You want to go to Winston's and grab a drink? Absolutely. Great. To Winston's. Okay. Hi. Welcome to Winston's. How many? Just two. The wait will be over an hour. Hannah! Greg! Hey! Look who it is. What are the odds? What are you two doing here together? Well, we were hoping to have a drink, but the wait is over an hour! Do you guys wanna join us? We could pull up two extra seats. Oh, no. I'm sure they'd rather have their own table. That would be great, thanks. So then, I get an offer on the apartment. It's insanely over asking price, and you'll never guess who the buyer was. Jimmy Fallon. No way! I love him. He's great. He's great. Really shy, if you can believe it. Say, Sam! What've you been up to all these years? Well, I stayed here to work after high school, as Eddie's apprentice at the cafe. I started managing the place at 26, and eventually, I bought it. Isn't that amazing? Thank you. I was laying down roots. Let's get another bottle. I'll be right back. Could we just get one more, please? Thank you. Excuse me. Are you okay? I'm just getting some fresh air. Why are you here with Greg? Why are you here with Sarah? I don't know, you tell me. I thought you were dating someone else. Like I said, it's complicated. Why does it matter to you? It doesn't. Really? Seems like it does. I just... I can't keep bumping into my past. It needs to stop. I gotta focus on my future. With Greg and the big shot Williams? With my pen pal, okay? Whether it's Greg or not. I just, I need to give it a shot. With your pen pal. Yes. Okay. So what are you saying, exactly? I'm saying I... I can't be around you, all right? And why is that? You know why. No. I really don't. Tell me. You don't know why. No. I don't know why, Hannah. So why don't you tell me? I'm here, right now, in front of you. You just, you walked out of my dorm room that night, and you never came back. You made it very clear that you didn't want me around. I didn't know what I wanted. My mom was dying. I... I needed you. I'm not a mind reader. You said you wanted to be alone and I respected that. What was I supposed to do? It doesn't even matter anymore. You should probably just get back inside. You think it's easy for me to see you? That it's only hard for you? You're up late. I went to a movie with a lady from Susan's book club, Cheryl. A date! How'd that go? It felt a bit forced, truthfully. Well, maybe if you keep trying it'll feel right? I don't think that's how it works. Is everything alright? No. Maybe. I don't know. What's on your mind, kiddo? Okay. When I signed up for this Christmas Cupid thing, I wasn't just doing it for research. I was doing it because I wanted you to find someone. I was worried that you seemed lonely and isolated, and that you'd never get over your heartbreak over mom. And now I'm realizing that this whole time I've really, pretty much just been describing myself. This about your pen pal? He seems... perfect. He's kind and thoughtful, and there's something about the way that he writes. I feel like, I... I don't know, I feel like he understands me. I think he could maybe be the one. So, what's the problem? Well, I mean, besides the fact that I still have no idea who he is. I'm still thinking about someone else, and I can't shake it. Sam? Is it that obvious? It is to your old dad. Love isn't rational, my dear, it's magical. You'll figure it out. How'd you know mom was the one? Well, I think I knew for sure when we were out for dinner, and I was so nervous... I started to stutter. She reached across the table, put her hand on mine. It was like a jolt of electricity, a spark. Suddenly, my stutter went away. And I knew right then and there that everything would be okay, as long... As long as I had her by my side. Do you ever think that... you could have that spark with someone else? No one will ever replace your mother, Hannah. But if this Christmas Cupid experience has taught me anything, it's that it's... it's okay to move forward. To feel something for someone again. Nothing would make your mother... happier. It's so hard to let go of the past. Well, maybe... maybe it's not about letting go entirely, but maybe not holding on quite so tight. I'm really sorry I've avoided coming home as much as I have. Sometimes the memories were just too much. I really miss being home. You're here now, that's what counts. Okay. Here. Gimme some of that. All right. Good. I second that. I can't believe Sam said that. I said some pretty harsh things, too. Well, if it makes you feel any better, I had a doctor's appointment this morning, and guess what? What? Doctor Daniel told me that he hopes that you are his pen pal. Really? A doctor for a brother-in-law? I could get on board with that. Look, it's a flyer from Martha! Here. Come here bud. What does it say? "Dear Christmas Cupid participants. "This is a reminder to write your final letters "to your pen pals before you find out who they are. "Include how you plan to reveal yourselves. "Looking forward to a night of serendipity on Christmas Eve! "Martha Matchmaker." Okay! Thanks! Susan! Happy almost Christmas Eve. Ted. Thank you. You too! What are your plans for the big day? Since Paul passed away and the kids aren't here, I'm just in a house by myself. Why don't you come have Christmas dinner with us? I don't want to impose on your family, I... No, no. No imposition. I promise. You know what? That would be great. Thank you. How was the date with Cheryl? Oh, goodness, that woman is a chatterbox. I hardly said a word. I should have warned you about that. Bye. Bye! You're late. By one minute. You're still late. Since when do you care? Since now. You're grumpy. Why are you grumpy? I'm not grumpy. Okay... Fine. Hannah came by and dropped this off for you. I don't want it. Throw it out. What? Throw it out? Yeah. Now. Gone. Capiche? Okay. Look, I might have only just turned 20, but I know what's going on here. You're in love with her. I beg your pardon? Hannah? You love her. Stop trying to deny it. I can see it. Sam. You have to tell her. Dear Hutch, I can't believe it's almost Christmas Eve already. Strangely enough, I wish it was further away so we could keep writing one another. Your letters have meant more to me than I ever thought possible. You've helped me realize that it's time I moved on from the past, and really let myself see a future. I haven't told you yet why I chose the name Stardust. When I was growing up, every single year on Christmas Eve, my mom would read the book "The Christmas Star" to me and my sister. Yeah. The same book that the earrings you found for me were designed after. Pretty serendipitous, huh? It's this beautiful old book from the '40s, and sadly, ever since she passed away, we haven't been able to find our copy anywhere. Anyway, my mom would always tell me that every time I look into the sky and see a shining star, it is a reminder that she is with me. I can't wait to finally meet you. I'll be wearing the Christmas Star earrings, eagerly searching the room for you. And, if I forget to say it at the festival, thank you for everything. Your pen pal. It's Hannah. I told you I was not good with words. The idea of writing to someone in the hopes of finding love sounded ridiculous, but I'm so happy I did. I feel deeply connected to you and this whole process has made me realize how closed off I was to the world. Thank you for opening my eyes. No matter what happens after tomorrow night, know that you mean so much to me, and that I care for you deeply. I'll be the one holding a book. With love, Hutch. I can't believe how nervous I am. What if it's Principal Cullen? Stop! Martha wouldn't do that to you. I wonder why his name is Hutch. You can find out tonight! I'm just so glad that I don't have to see Sam tonight. The last time we saw each other was so bad. Why are you thinking about Sam the night that you might meet your soulmate? I know, you're right, you're right, you're right. Hey, speaking of soulmates? I told Naomi that I think Christmas Cupid is, it just might be the fix that we've been looking for. Really? How? By matching people with a pen pal. She loved the idea. We're gonna call it "Perfect Pen Pals." I love it! It's great! You look great, Aunt Hannah. Your pen pal is one lucky guy. You are absolutely beautiful. Your mom's dress looks perfect on you. Thank you, dad. You look so handsome. Are you ready to go find your spark? I'm ready. Let's take a picture! Sam in a suit? What are you doing here? Did you sign up? I can't believe you signed up and you never told me. It's Hannah. What? My pen pal is Hannah. Are you serious? This is crazy. It's like fate. I know. How do I look? Okay, yeah. Perfect. Really? Definitely, she's gonna love it. Surprise. Oh my gosh, Spencer? It's been you this whole time? I... I can't believe it. Are you disappointed? No. No, of course not. Let's dance. Okay. Good luck, Sam! I really hope Hannah is my pen pal. I had a huge crush on her in high school. I think now could finally be my chance. Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up too high, because Daniel and Hannah are basically spoken for. They are both convinced they are each other's pen pals. Really? The doctor? Hannah thinks they could even be soulmates. She's totally smitten. I feel bad for Sam, though. I think he's still hung up on her, after all these years. He needs to get over it already. Move on. She's a tech mogul for crying out loud. Hey, Sam. What are you doing here? I just came here to give you this. What's this? It's Hannah's. Martha told me that you two are pen pals and she left it at the post office. Could you give that back to her? No way. She's my pen pal? That is amazing! I was hoping it was her. I... I'll definitely give this to her. Thank you. Hey, Sam. I think she's the one. I really do. Isn't that crazy? Yeah, well, she's one of the most amazing people I've ever known, so... be good to her. Of course. Sam! What are you... what are you doing here? Martha, wanted my help with something, but I'm... just leaving. Have a great night. Is that... is that... is that it? What do you want me to say? I don't... I don't know. Look, I thought about what you said the other night. And I think you're right. I think it's time to move on from the past. You look beautiful. Thank you. Yeah. Bing. Susan, you're Comet? I was hoping it was you. To be honest, I was wishing for you too. May I? Susan, would you like to dance? Yes, I'd love to. Lizzie? Max! Are you Dial? You're Skywalker? Come on! Looking for someone? Daniel. I believe this is for you. I'm... I, I just... I... I can't believe it's really you! Do you want to go somewhere where it's quiet? Yes. Yes! Can you give me a minute? Yeah, I'll just go grab our coats. Okay. Sarah? What are you doing sitting here all by yourself? My pen pal isn't here. I think he stood me up. What? I'm sure he'll come. Just give it time. Well, I'm only gonna stay a little longer before I leave. One sec... one sec. So you were right, Yeah, I guess I was. He's waiting for you. Go. Are you sure? Yeah. I'll be fine. Okay. Do you want my coat? No, I'm actually fine. Thank you. It's funny. We had so much to say in our letters and now it's... hard to find the words. I know. It's weird. You know, I think I know what might break the ice. Wait. I'm sorry, I, I... I don't think I can do this. Are you not happy it's me? No, I am, I... I wanted it to be you more than anything. I just... I don't know, I thought I would... I thought I would feel something more when I saw you tonight. I know what you mean, I mean, I... I expected to feel... Like a, like a... spark. Yeah. Exactly. I just, I don't think that we should force this. Our letters. We were so connected. I know. The way you opened up about how your brother's deafness affected your family. Brother? What? I don't, I don't... I don't have a brother. What? Wait, are you Hutch? Hutch? No. No. You're not my pen pal! I'm not? No! No, there must have been some kind of a mix-up. I stood up my pen pal! You need to get back in there, it's Sarah! She's waiting for you, and she's about to leave. Go! Sarah? Yes! Look, are you sure? I can't just leave you. I'm fine, I'm fine. Go, go, go. Wait, wait, wait! What about the book? Who? To Hannah, I just left you in your dorm, and your first day of college is tomorrow. I'm so lucky to call you my girlfriend, and more importantly, my best friend. I love you, and I'm so proud of you for going after your dreams. I know you're gonna do amazing things. I believe in you, Sam. "Beleive". "I before e." It's Sam. It's been Sam all along! Okay. Dad? It's so late! You're not gonna ground me, are you? It's Susan, can you believe it? She's so great, dad. I've always thought so. It's funny how you can spend years knowing someone without really seeing them. I know what you mean. By the way, I told Susan she'd be welcome here for Christmas dinner? Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. Tell me about your night. I saw you leaving with Daniel, and the next thing I know, he's dancing with Sarah Anderson. I am so confused. I think I finally know what I want. Is that all I get? Yes. For now. More later. But, I gotta go before it's too late. I love you, dad. His cafe lights are on. Dear Hutch, my name is Hannah Morris. Many years ago, I made the worst mistake of my life, when I decided to break things off with the most amazing person I have ever known. It has taken me a long time to realize that the key to finding Christmas magic is spending it with the person you love most. Which has always been him. Thanks for everything, Hutch. But now, I must say goodbye, and do everything I can to make things right with the man of my dreams. Even if he does occasionally forget that it's "i before e, except after c. Sincerely, Hannah. Hi. Hannah, I'm so sorry that I stood you up. I'm... sorry I lied about signing up. When I realized it was you I was writing to, it was almost Christmas Eve. So you gave the book to Daniel? You said you didn't want me around. Sam. You said you wanted to focus on your future. You are my future. I love you, Sam Watson. I love you too, Hannah Morris. I always have, I always will. Even when you don't know what you want. Even when you try to push me away, I promise you I will never stop loving you. That's what I call a spark. Merry Christmas, Stardust. Merry Christmas, Hutch.
