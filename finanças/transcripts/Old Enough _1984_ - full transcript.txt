Hey, Karen, I think you got a piece of dirt on your face. It's a beauty mark. Hey, Karen, we're just kidding. [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Car door closing ] [ Music playing ] Hey, Red Raider. My name's Lonnie. You live here? Yeah. Which floor do you live on? All of them. All of them? Your father is the super? What? You got all four floors to yourself? Yeah. It's our house. You got a big family? Four people. That's it? Yeah. So can I come in or what? Why? I don't know. She's coming over for a while. Who's she? Katherine. She takes care of us. Come on. Come on. Do you wanna play something? Huh? I've got some games. Like what? LONNIE: Life, Risk. No, that takes too long. Monopoly? Stratego? Candy Land? That's stupid. Scavenger Hunt? Domain? [ Music playing ] Holy shit! Oh, Christ. [ Laughs ] It ain't funny! Sorry. So, which do you wanna play? I'm not in the mood. Where'd you get this? It was a present. KAREN: Real? I guess. You can tell if it's fake, if the probe part comes off when you scratch it. LONNIE: Hey! I guess it's the real thing. [ Laughs ] I bet it cost a lot. [ Laughs ] I'm going. [ Music playing ] She dresses funny. Yeah. I like it. [ Music playing ] [ Car horn honking ] [ Car engine revving ] KAREN: Come on. What? I wanna teach you something. I can't. I got to get on. Do what you want. Sounds boring to me. LONNIE: Wait a second. I don't feel good. I'm going home. It's okay. My mom will call. [ Car engine revving ] Wait a second. Hang up. This is a cinch. They'll know. They'll figure it out. Trust me. Shh. Uh... Yeah, hold on a sec. Say, "I'm concerned about her health." -It's what she always says. -Huh? -Just say it. -Uh... I'm concerned about her health. Lonnie, Lonnie, yeah. This is Missus, Missus... -LONNIE: Sloan. -Sloan. Yeah. She's sick or something. I'm sure she'll be all right. Yeah. Yeah. Listen, don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. [ Laughing ] Jesus, they already got you dead and buried. -So? -So, no problem. Okay, you ready? For what? Well, if you wanna hang around with me, I got to teach you stuff. -Okay? -Okay. Just don't look anyone in the face or you're cooked, and that includes me. Got it? Yeah. So, go. And get good stuff. WOMAN: Excuse me. LONNIE: Sorry. Don't take all day. Can I help you with something? No, I'm just looking. Chicken. I'm cutting out here now. [ Gasps ] MAN: You forget something? -No. -Maybe paying? You in on this, too, kid? No, it's just me. She didn't do anything. Yeah, but you did. Let's have it. Show him what you got. MAN: In your back pocket. And what's in the bag? Come on, all of it. What about you? I told you. It's just me. Next time, steal it from your mother. Now get the hell out of here and stay out. [ Car engine revving ] [ TV voices in background ] I'm never going in there again. That guy sees everything. Not everything. Wow. I've done better before. How'd you get all this? Simple. I like this color, though. Look. Purple passion, that's good. What I really want is fiery red. That's my color. Hey, I got perfect lips, you know. Two points, perfect. No, you ain't got it. Sister Mary Margaret is always getting pissed off at me for wearing so much makeup. You know what I told her? Told her that if God made me perfect, I might as well show it. You know what I mean? She threw me in Father Stitch's office for that one. You have nuns for teachers? Yeah. Don't you? I don't think so. Every one of 'em, and they all got the exact same glasses. You know, those plastic gray kind? The kind with the chain around the neck? And they all wear them cripple shoes. They don't get married, you know. Yeah, I know. But I seen Father Stitch and some of them nuns. My music teacher was in love with my science teacher. How'd you know? You could tell. Whenever we had music, he'd come in and ask her some dumb question. Like, "Do you have an eraser?" Or "When's the period over?" Big deal. And he leaned over her, way over her. What are you, queer? Did they ever kiss? I guess. KAREN: Where? How do I know? They ever make out? Are you kidding? Sister Evangeline was making out with Father Stitch right in the chapel, at the altar. MRS. BRUCKNER: Karen? Karen? KAREN: This is Lonnie. She lives around the block. Nice to meet you. What do you want? I want you to try this on so I can hem it. KAREN: That thing? I'm not wearing that. What do you want me to look like, some wrinkly nun? Don't talk about the sisters like that, do you hear me? This is a confirmation, not some party of yours. Slip it on. -Now? -Now. I thought I told you to be here at 3:00. It ain't 3:00 anymore. -Sorry. -What? Apologize right to your father. I said I'm sorry. Okay? Sorry don't fix water pipes. Look at me. I had stuff to do, Dad. Stuff? Yeah, things. Oh, things. I sure don't wanna mess up whatever things you got going. Yeah, right. Come here. Over here. Here. If I got things to do, your things ain't worth shit, you hear me? Smith from 4B called, the toilet's backed up. They called twice already. Jesus, what the hell, are they swim in it? Hmm? Or maybe they dance on it? Oh, stop that. Mother Mary, stop it. I have work to do. You're gonna look real nice. KAREN: Hey, Sloan. Uh... Thanks. LONNIE: For what? For covering for me over at the store. That's okay. Okay. See you tomorrow, then. I can't. I have camp. KAREN: So? Skip out. Tomorrow's an overnight, two straight days. I'm not supposed to be home in-between. So? Take an overnight at my house. It's better than sleeping on a hunk of mud. How can I? I don't know. Figure it out. [ Music playing ] [ Car engine revving ] How was camp? Good. MRS. SLOAN: Mm-hmm. I mean, okay. You know, the same. We had nature today. MR. SLOAN: Oh, great. You had nature yesterday. Oh, yeah. I guess I mixed it up. We had boating today. MRS. SLOAN: Mm-hmm. LONNIE: It was pretty good. I mean, it was fun. That's the first positive thing I've heard you say about camp in a month. Maybe we should sign you up for three or four more weeks. No! [ Laughing ] I mean, you can't. It's over at the end of the week. Just keep you out of trouble until school starts. I'm not in any trouble. MR. SLOAN: Just to keep you off the streets, you know. I'm not on the streets. He's only joking, Lonnie. I know. Diane. DIANE: What? Can you keep a secret? Yeah. I have to tell you a secret. What? You have to promise not to tell anyone. How can I promise if I don't even know what it is? You have to or I can't tell you. Is it about that girl? And what if it is? Then, I'll keep it. -It is. -Tell me. I skipped camp. I know. And I'm gonna do it again. [ Music playing ] What are you doing, honey? What? Nothing. Just sitting. -[ Phone ringing ] -I got it. [ Phone ringing ] Don't worry, I got it. Well, if you got it, then, get it. Hello? Yes, it is. She's still sick. [ Knocking ] -Two days? -Yeah. All right. Look what I got. The passkey. Could you believe it? He was right there in the room, and I got it? Come on. LONNIE: What if someone's there? It hasn't been rented yet. Come on. LONNIE: What are you doing? Just looking. We're just looking, Mr. Bruckner. Are utilities included? You need to fix the plumbing yourself? Should we take it, dear? It's roomy, but it's got a good view of the garbage cans. We can put the TV in here. Yeah. I'll put the a Tangier over here and the piano over here, and the Davenport over there. Are you gonna eat or are you gonna stare at me for an hour? No, no, no, the food's not on the table yet. Charles, serve the Vichyssoise. What? The soup, the Vichyssoise. It's perfect. What are you doing? I'm eating my steak. It's just the way I like it, thick and juicy. No. We're having pressed duck. Charles, bring us the pressed duck, please. Well, what do we got to drink, Charles? White wine, please. White wine? Yeah. White wine with poultry. It's perfect. I want a chocolate shake, Charles. Fine. Bring her a chocolate shake. And we'll have bananas flambe for dessert. Bananas for dessert? Yeah. It's very elegant. Your bananas is rotten, and this whole dinner stinks. [ Footsteps approaching ] Shh. I think I hear him coming. Lucky. Let's get out of here. Hurry up. Simple. [ Gasping ] Go ahead. I'll be there in a minute. What are you doing? Nothing. Oh? -Where is the key? -I don't got it. I'm showing a new tenant the apartment, and I ain't got the key, so let's have it. Okay. Okay. Here. [ Slap, gasps ] Don't you ever go in a tenant's apartment again. -It was empty. -I don't care. If I ever catch you in an apartment again, you're gonna wish you were somebody else's kid. And that goes for your friend, too. -Karen. -Shut up. Just shut up. I called Father Stitch. [ Music playing ] [ Coin clinking ] Where are you going? You haven't finished. You didn't confess. Go on.

You told the priest what we did, right? No. Oh, boy, you're gonna burn. Burn? Burn in the pit of fire. In the pit of fire? I mean, just 'cause I didn't tell a guy what we did? Well, I told him, so I'm okay. Well, let's go back. That's not all you got to do. Come on. I got this at first communion. The one I got now is better, but it'll do. Come here. Like this. No. Left to right. Okay. Hail Mary-- put your finger... on that bead there. Okay. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, amen. Okay?

It's French for good-bye. Au revoir? Right, au revoir. Au revoir. Hey, your friend ain't bad, give her a couple of years and send her by. You're a pervert. I hear they ain't letting you confess 'cause what you've been telling them is too sick. Very funny. Leave her alone. She likes me. How do you know? She came over, she spent the night. How do you know she wasn't over to see me? I saw her looking up at me at dinner. She likes me. She don't need you. Leave her alone, she's mine. MRS. SLOAN: Lonnie? What are you doing? I'm sorry. I didn't mess anything. -No. -I'll clean it up. I didn't know you use make up. I mean, I didn't know you were interested in that kind of stuff. I'm not. I mean, not really. No, it's okay.

Now, get your partners, we're going to play a cha-cha-cha, everybody knows how to do the cha-cha. One, two, three.

Where'd you get that? 24 bucks. All right. I don't think that lady in the coat check room had such a hot time. She was sleeping through the whole thing. You mean you stole that? Yeah, I got it. You can't do that. Don't act like you never took nothing before, Sloan. It's just like in the Five & Dime, except a whole lot better. It's not the same. Stealing's stealing, and your friends aren't gonna be missing a few bucks anyways. You can't do that, not there. What? You can't take that money. You just better watch what you say to me, Sloan. Your head's getting pretty big these days, and I'm getting about ready not to like you. What do you mean? If you wanna keep hanging around, you just watch it, is all. Just watch it. [ Music playing ] Let's burp you, okay? Big burp, big burp for mommy. Watch out! What? You just fell out of the window. -There. -You're dead. Pfft. Now you're not. Thanks. Why don't you go into the living room? I have to be in with the baby now. Where's that girl? You don't have to whisper. It's not a secret anymore. Don't you wanna play with her anymore? I don't know. Hi. Hi. Where you been lately? Here, around. I thought you were sick or something. No, I'm not sick. I'm sorry about the money. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay? Yeah, okay. All right. So you gonna come over or what? I want you to come over. You wanna come over? Okay. Where is everyone? Old lady Kramer kicked off last night. She died? Bit the dust, but didn't come up chewin'. So where is everyone? Kramer's funeral. They couldn't wait to stick her in the dirt. How come you didn't go? JOHNNY: What do I want at some old bat's funeral? Where are you going, Red Raider? I don't know. Just 'cause your best girl ain't here don't mean there's nothing to do. So, what do you wanna do? I got an idea. What? Come on, I'll show you. -Tell me. -It would be a surprise. Don't you like surprises? Come on. [ Music playing ] Sit down. Sit. You're acting like you ain't never been here before. We never got a chance to talk, you and me, huh? -Wanna drink? -Yeah. Okay. How old are you? Almost eleven three-quarters. That's pretty old. So, um... got yourself a boyfriend? No. How come? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I don't know. I guess I'm not ready. -Look ready to me. -What? You know, I was ready when I was your age. Don't you think you're ready? You wanna play cards? Karen's got cards. Strip poker? No. That's the only game I like. You know Gin? Gin? Yeah. Okay. We'll play your game, but we'll play with my rules. Okay. You've had it, Red Raider. You're not out yet. If you lay the card I think you're stupid enough to lay, you're a long goner. I got you figured out pretty good, Red. Gin. No one's beat me yet. What do you got? Not bad. I almost had it. Yeah, but almost ain't worth shit. So what are the special rules? Okay. Put your hand there. -Why? -Are you asking or playing? Put your hand there. Whoever wins gets to hit the other guy in the knuckles. Ow! Oh, come on, I didn't hurt you. I hardly touched you. You should see what I do when I play with the guys. Some of them I smashed ain't doing much with their hands these days. Hey, I didn't hurt you, did I? I'm sorry. [ Door opens ] We're playing stickball outside. You gonna pitch or what? JOHNNY: Ball? Yeah, sure. I'm changing my clothes. Meet me outside. [ Music playing ] JOHNNY: Keep your eye on the ball, okay? This is right. Now, see where it says, "Bingo every Friday at 7:15 p.m."? If you swing and you hit right over that, it's a single. If you hit right over that sign, it's a double. And if you hit right over those arches, it's a triple. And if you right over that cross, right over that cross, it's a home run. Okay? Okay. So hit one for me, all right, Red? Okay. Great. KAREN: Hey, lay off. I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to her. KAREN: Don't listen to him. Nail one for me, all right, Red? KAREN: Don't do it. It's okay, I'll play. Good choice. Good choice, Red. All right. Let's go. -MAN: Ball one. -Yo, come on, Johnny. Johnny, what's going on? MAN: That's ball two. Why don't you watch the ball, not the pitcher? You're pitching a walk. Come on, Johnny. MAN: Ball three. Oh, Johnny, man, you're pitching a walk. MAN: Ball four. MAN: Let's play some real stickball. MAN: What, are you sweet on her? Pussy-whipped pitcher. Thank you. So, who's coming? Oh, I thought I told you already. I forgot. The Drakes. Mr. and Mrs. Sagers. Remember you met them in the country? Aunt Linda. That's all. You can come if you feel like it. LONNIE: No, thanks. Mom? Uh-huh? How come Aunt Linda comes alone? Oh, I don't know. I guess I never know who she'll like, so I just don't invite anybody for her. LONNIE: Isn't she married? If she were, you'd have probably heard about it. You don't tell me everything, you know. I'll be sure to tell you about it if it happens. There's lots you don't tell me. Oh? Well, what would you like to know? I don't know. Do you think she's ever... you know...? Ever what? Mom! Honey, I don't know what you're talking about, honestly. You know, been, like, with a man. Well, um, I'm pretty sure she has. I mean, I've never really asked her about it, but I'd be willing to bet on it. But she's not married. Lonnie, lots of single women go out with lots of men. That's how they find the right man. Oh. She must've had a lot of boyfriends. MRS. SLOAN: She's had her share. When was her first one? Oh, Linda started pretty young. -MAN: Couldn't these guys --? -Yeah. Very nice. She's moving in? Yeah. Croner's old place. Not bad, huh? She's pretty old. JOHNNY: She's alright. Good legs. Not bad. Not bad by a long shot. Hey, Carla, let me take them. Thanks, Johnny. Looks like you're feeding an army. Just some friends. You got lots of friends? Everybody's got friends. What kind of friends you got? Same kind you have. Probably a little older. I ain't got no friends around here. Just a bunch of assholes. Sorry. But you know what I mean. They're all wimps. They'll grow up. I like older people, anyway, you know, adults. They got, you know, more. More? Yeah, more. Anyway, older people like me better anyway. Always have. CARLA: That so? Yeah. I guess they think I'm mature or something. You look pretty mature. Yeah? Do you think? I don't know, I think so. Yeah, Johnny, real mature. Yeah? Like older people could go for me? Sure. Well, what do you know? -Well, thanks. -Oh, I could take 'em. Oh, no. It's okay. Let me take them. They're heavy. It's a man's job. You're a sweet kid. You can put them on the table. Come on, I'm not gonna bite you. I... Thanks. You're a good kid. Go on. Go on home. I got some people coming. Oh, yeah. Okay. See you later, little man. KAREN: Hey, look, there's Carla. Look at the way she's dressed. LONNIE: Her pants are so tight. KAREN: Yeah, she has to lie down and put them on. LONNIE: You know her already? KAREN: Yeah, I know all about her. I know she's 32. And I know she works in a beauty parlor. She does nails. -Hi, honey, how are you doing? -Hi. -Okay. -Oh, I like your belt. Look. Let me see your nails. They look good. Nice. See you later. Alright. And I know she doesn't have any guys. How did you know? KAREN: I'm not stupid, Sloan. Single women go out with lots of guys. That's how they figure out who's the right one. Well, she told me she doesn't. Yeah, but I'll bet she does. You don't even know her. Where did he go? Who? Him. Your father? I guess he's up fixing something. Fixing what? MRS. BRUCKNER: I don't know. He said something about air-conditioning for 3B. Well, that's Carla's new apartment. MRS. BRUCKNER: Mm-hmm. Well, she wants air-conditioning? I guess so. Well, we don't have air-conditioning. If she wants to pay for it, she can have it. Oh, fancy. You take care of yourself. Don't go worrying about nobody else. Finished already? She ain't got the right parts. KAREN: She doesn't have all the right parts? Yeah. [ Sighs ] But the one she's got ain't too bad. It's you. Yeah. Who else? You going in or out? Out, I guess. Okay. See you later, then. Hi, Dad. Hi. What's up? Nothing that wasn't up a minute ago. You finished with these tools here? MR. BRUCKNER: Yeah. I've had just about all I can take with those tools today. I thought I'd, um-- I thought I'd finish fixing that pipe up on 4, like you wanted me to. That's good. You're learning. Are you gonna follow your old man's footsteps? Yeah. Sure. MR. BRUCKNER: Do me a favor. Don't. [ Music playing ] [ Knocking ] Oh, it's you. Yeah, it's me. Are you expecting somebody else? No. Your dad was just up here. He's gonna put in the air-conditioning. It's gonna be real cool up, because. Yeah? What'd you bring the tools for? I don't know. I just thought... Just thought you'd come and see how cool it is? Yeah, exactly. [ Music playing ] There she is. Come on. Jesus. I think she's walking to another country. Come on. We'll lose her. KAREN: Forget it. Sloan, you're really stupid sometimes. You can't go here. Why not? We don't belong here. Get it? We're going back. Now. [ Car honks ] [ Music playing ] [ Crowd chatter ] [ Speaks Spanish ] MAN: Check it out. [ Speaks Spanish ] [ Crowd chatter ] MAN: Yo, man, check out this mariquita, man. [ Speaks Spanish ] [ Speaks Spanish ] Huh? [ Crowd chattering ] [ Speaks Spanish ] [ Speaks Spanish ] How many you want? One, just one. MAN: Anything else? No, that's it. [ Speaks Spanish ] I mean, 25 cents, please. You're a fool. You could have gotten killed there. Yeah, but I didn't. So you found out where she works, is that it? Found out everything. She's got a man. So she's got a man, that it? What else do you wanna know? I bet there's lots more to know. Only I don't have to go anywhere to find it out. I got all the information, not you. [ Lock rattling, door opening ] You can't find out anything without me. Pretty nice... air-conditioning and everything. I guess she does more than just talk with that guy. -What? -Look at her bed. Bet you didn't find anything like this up where you went. Here. Have one of these. This is good. Come on. What? Karen, what's the matter? My dad's tool belt. What's it doing here? He was putting in the air-conditioning. Well, that's in the other room. I know. What are his tools doing--? Oh. JOHNNY: Carla? Are you here? It's Johnny. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I thought I heard something. I mean, I had to check on some pipes. Look at this. So what? So what's it doing here? Well, wasn't dad putting in the air-conditioner? The air-conditioning is in the other room. Wait. You mean, you think him and her... up here? I don't know. He's been coming up here a lot. Well, what do you know? I never thought the old man was up to it. It's not funny. What do you know? It's not funny. You think it's funny? Your own dad up here with some slut? She's not a slut! Oh, she's a slut, all right. -Oh, grow up. -You grow up. [ Door slams ] We better clean up. I don't know where she got this from. JOHNNY: On the hook. What are you staring at? I don't know about you, but I'm getting out of here. [ Door closes ] Don't worry. She won't be home until 6:00. How do you know so much about her? I talk to her. Ain't I allowed to talk to her? It was you up there, wasn't it? What if it was? Tell Karen. JOHNNY: Why should I? She was crying. She'll be all right. [ Knocks on door ] [ Knocks on door ] What do you want? I have to talk to you. Forget it. LONNIE: I have to tell you something. What? That my father was up there with that slut? No. Get out of here. -LONNIE: Wait a minute. -Just get out of my house. [ Music playing ] Hello? Is Karen home? It's Lonnie. She's not? Oh. Okay. Bye. [ Music playing ] Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of death. Amen. Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. [ Music playing ] Hey, hey. Did you tell her? No. Then, I'm gonna tell her. She should know. Hold on. Hold on. I, um... I didn't get a chance to yet. You see, I thought maybe you'd help me figure out how to tell her. Well, just say that it was you. No, no, no. Not here. Come here. Come on, Red. I'm not gonna to bite you. Wanna go for a ride, Red? -No. -Come on. Get on. I don't wanna do this! Too bad. Let me off! Look out! [ Music playing ] [ Cars honking ] Watch out! Pretty scary, huh? Stop it! I wanna get off! No way. Stop it! Forget about it! Look out! [ Van honks ] -Let me off! -No. LONNIE: Look out! Stop! You keep your face out of other people's business. You got that? This is nothing compared to what I'm gonna do to you if you tell Karen. Do you hear me? -Yeah. -What? Yeah, I hear you. So you just keep it to yourself! KAREN: Keep what to herself? Keep what to yourself? It was Johnny who was up there with Carla. It's not your father. You? Yeah. Yeah, it's me. What are you so surprised for? I thought it was Dad. Well, it wasn't. Anyway, you're too busy with your friend here all the time to see what's going on in your own damn house! Wait a minute. Where are you going? -It's all your fault. -What? You had to know everything, and you had to know all about her. I tried to tell you. You mean you knew? You knew all along, and you didn't even tell me? I tried. Just go home. Just get out of here. Aren't you going to go home to your mommy? Ain't your maid waiting to open the door for you? -Shut up. -What? I said shut up. [ Slap ] [ Knock on door ] Yes? It's me. Hi, honey. You can come in. You want anything? No. Daddy and I are going to dinner, so it's just you and Diane. You're going out? MRS. SLOAN: Yes. Your top is undone, you know. Oh. Don't you want to do it up? MRS. SLOAN: Oh, I'll get to it. I'll do it. Can I do it? Okay. That would be nice. Lonnie? What's wrong? Tell me what's wrong. First day of school tomorrow, huh? Diane's so excited, you're gonna have a great time getting her to go to bed. You had a good summer, huh? Yeah. Oh, Lonnie. Look. You have the most beautiful eyes. [ Knock on door ] Hurry up. I'll come when I'm ready. What are you doing? You're not allowed. It's not in the dress code. Nice, huh? I hate these uniforms. I like them. It's so stupid. Colors are nice. I'd rather be purple. There's that girl. [ Crowd chattering ] So? She's coming over here. Hi. Hi. First day? Yeah. School. Yeah. Summer was better than this is ever gonna be. I mean, it's not like it was-- it was different than other summers. Just hanging around and stuff. It was different. Yeah, I know. [ Bell ringing ] I got to go, anyway. Yeah. Well, I'll see you around? I guess. JOHNNY: Hey, Karen, let's go! KAREN: Hey, Sloan! Your color... It's good. I mean, this fiery red you copped for me is better. But what you got's okay. Yeah, I like it. [ Music playing ]
