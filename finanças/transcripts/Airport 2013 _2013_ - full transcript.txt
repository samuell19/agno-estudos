Yamada, did you have a bite of this? No. You haven't eaten it yet? I always thought it was dug up, until yesterday. Look, it says here, this is burdock with sesame sauce. It says "dug up", but it's actually picked. Freshly picked burdock. I know. It's already pickled, but really, was it dug up, or picked? You already know, right? Yeah. Okouchi! Hold onto this for me. Okay. Welcome. I'll be in your care. Then, when the passengers arrive, please take care of them. Understood! It'll be pretty tough, but hang in there! How do we explain the situation to the passengers? Just say the weather conditions in the Kanto region has deteriorated rapidly, causing bouts of tornadoes, and therefore planes cannot land at Haneda. What if they ask for the new departure time? The latest information just now puts the new departure time at around 1 hour from now. Ah, what about the meal vouchers for the restaurant? I have them. You're only supposed to give out one per person, Okay. but if a passenger asks for more, it's fine to give them a few more. Fulfilling all of the passengers' requests, that's how we do our job. Understood! But, no matter how hard you try, there will definitely still be passengers who complain. Hang in there. I'll give it my all! Come find me if you can't handle them. Okay! Then, I'll be going. Ah, about that thing we were discussing last time... Excuse me. Please consider it again. Manager! Please stop bringing that up. I'm serious. I know that! My mother isn't very well, I want her to rest easy. If you put it like that, now I have to, right? Of course, it's not just because of that! Manager, didn't I tell you yesterday? I respect you, Manager, but I never saw you in that way! Then, please see me in that way. The plane is about to arrive, let's focus on work! Roger that. Then, excuse me. Okouchi... Yes? This side of you... I love it! Thank you for your patience. Thank you for your patience. Hey! How do you feel? Hey! Good work. My heart is racing a little! It's good to try it once in a while, right? You're always just sitting around anyway! That's not a bad idea. How do you feel? The passengers will be getting off the plane soon. Really? I heard the flight to Haneda will land here. Really? It's good to try it once in a while, right? You're always just sitting around anyway. Right! Hey... Do I look like I have that much free time? Look, isn't it about time to receive the passengers? Oh, right, are you free tonight? I know this really authentic Chinese restaurant! I have something I want to discuss with you. That's rare! Someone proposed to me! Who? That's not important. It must be someone in here, right? Of course not. What are you going to say? No! Of course it's a no! I hate office romances. Right, that's why you left your last job! Why does everyone find their love interests from around them? Hey! The passengers are here! We'll talk later. Good luck! Okay! Here I go! Pleasure to be working with you. Likewise. Thank you for your patience. We're really sorry. Thank you for your patience. We're really sorry. Hey, hey, can we return to Tokyo by today? Once the weather at Haneda Airport settles down, the flight can resume. If my schedule gets delayed because of this, I can get proof, right? Um, what's it called again? A delay certificate. Right, that. If there is a need, it can be issued. May I ask if you require one? No, we don't. We don't have any plans after this, we're only going home. Wouldn't you ask for that normally? Let's have it anyway. Then, please check with the office later. I can't get it now? Yes, now is... Excuse me. Yes. How long will it be? It shouldn't be too long. But there's still at least one hour to go. Crap. There is a restaurant upstairs, if you don't mind, you can have a meal there. Here are some meal vouchers. Each voucher can give you one free meal. What should we do, dear? Isn't there anywhere else I can pass the time? I'm really sorry. There is only a restaurant in the airport. Sorry, the airport is a bit small. Can we go outside of the airport? We don't even know what time we will fly again, it's better to stay here, right? If you want to go outside, you can, but there's not much out there. It's a bit rural. Then we better go to the restaurant. Can we get one meal voucher per person? Of course. We have a few people... We have six. Please give me 6 tickets. Right away. Can we only get one voucher per person? No, there's no particular limit. Then, give me 8 tickets. Don't do that. She said it doesn't matter. The meal voucher is only valid for today. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. There. Excuse me. Yes! How long does it take to get to Tokyo by taxi? Taxi? Taking a taxi back, don't be silly! Just asking, nothing wrong with that. Well, about the time, it would take 3 hours. We'll already be in the air if you wait for an hour. Should we go to the restaurant now? Well? We won't get much done by just standing around. It's better to go early. There's a lot of other passengers as well. That's right, if we don't hurry there won't be any seats left. Then, can you take us there? Of course, please, this way. Grandpa, let's go! I'll stay here. What do you mean? I'm not hungry. And walking all over the place is a pain. You guys go without me. Come on, everyone should go together! Let's go, father! What's it matter? Gramps said he wanted to stay. So what will you do? Then, wait here for us, grandpa. We'll go have a meal. Please, enjoy yourselves. Wait here for us, okay? I won't come and find you if you get lost, okay? They're treating me like a kid. I'll stay with gramps. Don't you get it? Gramps wants to stay here with grandma. Leave them in peace. Then, let's go! I'm the ground staff, Okouchi. I'm Tanokura. Pleased to meet you. Ah, Yamada-san! Yes? I'll take the Tanokura family to the restaurant. We're going, okay? Got it. This way. This is Matsumoto Airport, right? That's right. It's my first time here. I didn't know this kind of airport even existed. The supermarket nearby hasn't even opened yet. Well... Only one or two flights land here per day. Please. Take the escalator to the second floor. Right this way. What are you doing? Aren't you taking the escalator? Employees have to take the stairs. Excuse me! Yes! I heard there were free meal vouchers for the restaurant. Were you on the Haneda flight? Yeah. For the trouble we've caused, we are sincerely sorry. No problem. Again, sorry, but can I see your boarding pass? Boarding pass? Huh? Where did it go... Eh? Do I need to show my boarding pass? That's right! But, did those people earlier show it? I saw them coming out of the gate. I came out along with them! Excuse me. Huh? Hey, you. Sorry for the wait. Is that the restaurant over there? That's right. That's actually the restaurant! I think it's full already. Is that so? Please wait here. I showed it to them, but they still won't let us in, attendant! I'm the ground staff, sir. Excuse me! Yes? Any room for 5? Sorry, with this situation... Then, can we make a reservation? Yes. One for the Tanokuras, 5 people, please. Okay. How long is the wait? 20 minutes. We'll be outside. Okay, my apologies. Please wait a bit longer. It'll be another 15 minutes. What will you do? I've already made a reservation for you. If it's only 15 minutes, we should be okay. I'll tell my husband. They said it'll be another 15 minutes. Can't be helped, it's not like there's anywhere else to go. Can you come for a sec? Okay. There's something I want to ask you. What is it? Is there a room I can use? A room? I have a very important work call to make, but I don't want anyone to listen in. Understood. Please wait. Excuse me. Is the VIP lounge occupied? Okay. Roger that. I'll take you there. I'll be back quickly. Thank you. This way. Um... Excuse me! It's fine. Yes? Don't mind her. Is it fine? Don't mind her. Understood. Right this way. Please. If there's anything you need, I'll be outside. You can leave us. But... We'll be okay. Okay, sir. I don't get it at all. Didn't I explain this to you already? What's the problem? Explain it to me again! Like I said...! Some tea, perhaps? Please leave us. Sorry. So? How are the passengers? Well, not too bad. Just as we thought, the departure time is still an hour away. Until then, hang in there. I'll give it my best. Excuse me. About what we were saying earlier... Manager. Not right now. Not now? That means I can expect to hear from you later? Right now, I want to focus on work! That's the spirit! Give it your all! Okay, I'll do my best! Let's do our best! Okay! Excuse me. Manager. I told you, right? About why I left my last job. Why is that again? I didn't talk about it in detail, but anything related to an office romance, I'm never trying again. Excuse me. I can leave my job here at any time! Excuse me... Where is my husband? He's taking a work call right now. Is that so? Where's Tanokura? He's in the VIP lounge inside. There's that kind of room? Let's go have a look! He's in a very important call, Let's not bother him. Ma'am, do you want to buy a magazine to read? Is there a book shop around? They sell magazines over there. Thank you, I'll have a look myself. You're fine? Mayu, hold onto this please. Excuse me. Yes? Is there something like an observation deck where I can have a look at the view around here? Yes, just take the elevator there to the 3rd floor, there will be an observation deck. Thank you. Thank you very much. Are you going to the 3rd floor as well? Yes. This is the 3rd floor. After you. After you. Excuse me. Thank you. Umm... Me? I knew it. It's been a long time. Umm... Don't you remember me? I suppose you wouldn't recognize me, dressed up like this. I'm sorry. Would be nice if you could remember. Give me a hint? Which college did you go to? Saga Women's College. High school? East Imari High. Middle school? South Imari. Could you be... Tachibana? It's been a long time, senpai. No way. It's you, Tachibana? You're so handsome now! Senpai, you haven't changed at all. I knew it was you from just one look. What are you saying? I feel like an old lady on the inside already. That's not true. You're the same as you were all that time ago. Cute. What do you do nowadays, Tachibana? I'm a pilot for domestic airlines. Of course. I should have known from your uniform. Oh, what am I saying? Are you alright? Senpai, are you here on travel? Please, don't call me senpai. Sure, but, how would I call you? Just like how you used to. That's a bit embarrassing... Ms. Tsuruhashi. Tsuruhashi. Feels a bit stiff! Can I just call you by your first name? It's Miyoko. That's right, Miyoko! Are you here on travel, Miyoko? That's right. Because my mom passed away, I went back to my hometown for the funeral. We were on our way back to Tokyo, but because there's bad weather at Haneda Airport, we could only land here. I think we have to wait here for at least another hour. But, then I run into you here... How should I put it... This... makes me feel... as if it was fate bringing us together. Doesn't it? Tachibana? Ma'am! Here! There are seats in the restaurant now! Thank you for coming to get me. Everyone is waiting downstairs. It's good that you knew I was here. The shop assistant told me. The view is beautiful here. The clouds are clearing up. On the right is Mount Otaki. On the left is Mount Hachimori. It must be nice, to be working here everyday. Well, I wouldn't say that... Up until last year, I was still working at Haneda Airport. Really? A lot happened since then. So I've only started working here this year. I'm a local here. Is that so? Let's go, madam. Okay! Miyoko! Wait, wait. He's my brother. I see. This is important. About that... The elevator will be a bit, would the stairs be okay? We can walk and talk. Everyone is waiting. I need a favor. I can almost guess what you want. Can you please ask your husband again? Absolutely not! I need 600,000 yen, no matter what. You still dare to ask? What? Didn't I tell you before? It's the last time, no more. You promised me, right? I thought it would be as well... You promised, right? Yes, I did promise. Then why are you still asking me? Give it up. If I don't get 600,000 yen, all of the previous investments would go up in smoke. I can't help you. The planetarium was my childhood dream! That's the first I've heard of it! Do you want me to give up my dream? What else can you do? There's not enough money! I beg you, without this 600,000 yen, the night sky will be empty. Is this money for light bulbs? Small bulbs. 60 yen each, and I need 10,000 of them! That's... too strange. What is? No matter what you say, your plan seems too simple. What does an amateur like you know? Even an amateur can see that! If you can't even buy light bulbs, how can you even build a planetarium? You've been lead on, brother! Don't interfere with my damn work! I really need to borrow that money! Enough! I may have come on a bit strong. Please! I'm in trouble here, help me out, please! Your husband must have the money, right? 600,000 isn't that much to him! Please, ask for me! You can go ask him yourself, can't you? Even though I don't think he'll lend it to you. Didn't you receive condolence money from the funeral? I beg you! You got money from mom's funeral, right? Miyoko. Sorry about the poster. It's fine... Are you interested in planetariums? I... I'll get Mr. Tanokura. What's with him? Mr. Tanokura. I'm Okouchi, with the ground staff. Mr. Tanokura? Come in! Please excuse me. What is it? Your seats are ready at the restaurant. Thanks. Well, go. Then, we'll continue this talk later. Honestly... I don't get it. How many years have you been married? Your daughter is entering college. 22 years. You've been together for that long, why not break up? What's it matter how long we've been married? But you don't love her anymore. You said that before. I heard it. I didn't say that! How awful! I didn't say I didn't love her, but after living together for 22 years, what's between us is not love anymore. That's what I said. So, what you're saying is you don't love her anymore. So break up already, I don't get you. Don't be silly. Then we can be together! I already said I can't do that! Can you consider my situation here a little bit? Huh? Ah, sorry. What did you say? I didn't hear you. Anyway, don't talk to me again until we get to Tokyo. My family is waiting for me, so I'll be going. She wants to stay here for a bit longer, is that alright? Yes, of course. I don't get it! Do you need anything, like tea? Nope. Then, excuse me. You should know what's going on, right? Please rest assured, my lips are sealed. You must not tell my wife. Understood. We won't pry into your private life. Did you meet her at work? You call this "not prying"? I'm sorry. My teeth have been healthy, ever since I was a kid. No cavities or anything. About half a year ago, I went to the dentist for the first time. Got my wisdom teeth pulled. She's been with me from that time on. A dental hygienist. At the dentists? Tanokura! What is it, brother? Where are the others? They're inside. Actually, there's something I want to talk to you about. I can almost guess what it's about. You know what I want? It's obvious. Then, take a guess! What a bother. Hey! Take a guess! You really are annoying. It's about a loan, right? Bingo! I respectfully decline. Here, here. Please help me again, just once more. This will be the last time. Why are you always asking? "Always" is a bit... Always! Not always... Always! It's not always! I'll be clear. I think this whole thing is a bit suspicious. I don't want to hear that kind of talk. Why a planetarium in this day and age? Tanokura. My planetarium is really different from what you have in mind. Listen. It can show the night sky from sundown to morning like a movie. You can see the clear night sky again, that's what I have in mind. So it's completely different from what you have in mind. Isn't that just like any normal planetarium? That's right. Mhm, yeah. There used to be lots of planetariums, but now they're going out of business, can't you tell? So why are you building one now? I'm building it because there are few around! Really? Brother. Forget about it. I know what you'll say. I know what you're going to say! Amateurs shouldn't be in this business. Is that so? You really didn't understand what I just said. Why can't an amateur do it? Wanting to build it is fine, but you need a more detailed plan, more research, project management, without that it'll definitely fail. Even though I'm an amateur, they're professional. I don't want to say this, but... Then don't say it. That's not what I mean, I'm just being polite. Being polite... That's not it! I feel like whoever you got on this project... ...is bad news. Kageyama is a reliable sort of guy! Kage... I recall you saying you met him in a bar. He sat next to me by chance. If that's not fate, then what is? I'm really sorry, but I can't help you. The planetarium is my dream! Miyoko told me. She said you never looked up to the night sky, even as a kid. You've never even been to a planetarium, right? Everyone has their own planetarium, inside their own hearts! You're something, brother. Please! No, no. Everyone is waiting for you guys! Enough! If we give up now, the previous investments would be gone! Ow, ow, ow! I won't chase you on what I lent you already. And the interest too? You're dreaming. I want interest, but I'm not going to make you pay it now. Please! Please! Let go. This conversation is over. You almost broke my wrist! You're crazy. Looks like he isn't in a good mood today. Mr. Tanokura has a lot on his mind, I'm sure. Like? I just feel like he does. If you don't mind, here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 left. Can I exchange this for money? Unfortunately not. Excuse me! Yes! Over here. I found my plane ticket. What's that? Can I get the meal vouchers? Huh... Where did it go? It was just here... I'm very sorry, but we're out of meal vouchers. They're already gone? If you give me your receipt, I can refund you later. Receipt? Yes, if you'd excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Yes? Any news about the flight? I'm really sorry, but there hasn't been any news yet from Haneda Airport. It's over... What's going on? Doesn't matter. Let's order first. I'm fine with anything. Order properly. Don't be like that. It's fine. It's not fine, we still have an hour left. Stop that. Brother, brother, calling for me? I'm fine with anything too. Not you. Then you'll order first. Don't be like that too, Mayumi. Really, I'm fine. Father? I'm fine with anything too. Mutsuo! Order. I said it's whatever. Then, what about the Tonkotsu ramen? It's the best dish here, in my opinion. Then, 3 Tonkotsu ramen please. 3 Tonkotsu ramen! And a coffee for me. And a coffee! One Chef's salad for me! Sorry, we're sold out. Then, 2 Tonkotsu ramen. Okay. That's too much. None of your business. We should really call grandpa up. He seems kind of lonely. I can get him for you. If you can, please. No problem. Thank you. Leave him be! He's reminiscing the old days. I'm coming too. What about your ramen? Quiet. So the flight is still grounded? That's right, when the weather at Haneda lifts, we'll inform you right away. Sorry for the trouble. I'm fine, but... My brother seems to have something on his mind. Can't even sit still. Sorry to add to your troubles. Is it alright if I asked you a few personal questions? Like? Is that man your mother's sibling? He is my mom's brother, why? He's an interesting person. He's always switching between jobs. No family. He's a little strange. But I like him. And, what does your father do? I don't know. Well, I get it. I also don't know what my dad does. I heard he was a legal consultant. Your name was Okouchi, right? Yes, what is it? Have you married? No, not yet. Then, a boyfriend? Have you introduced a boyfriend to your family? Boyfriend? I've introduced one before. Is that so? And? Nothing. Granddad, your family is waiting for you at the restaurant. I said I'd stay here. They want to eat together with you. No need. I'll wait for the flight here. But the boarding gate is on the second floor. How about we wait on the second floor? I want to have some quiet, to think some things over. When the flight resumes, you can call me. Right. My wife passed. It must be tough. It's fine, she left peacefully. Here, hold her. That's okay, no thanks. Have a look inside. I'll pass on that. She became really small. Hey, grandpa, got a moment? I'm just going to tell something to grandpa. Then, I'll return upstairs. Can you stay? Me? Do you remember we talked about Mr. Inuyama? It's who we were talking about before. Can't recall, huh? Who is he? Him! Ah, yes, yes. Still can't remember? He's the person I'm seeing right now. Actually, about that, he's here right now. Here? He was on the same flight as us. He flew from Saga with us? I said to him, I'll introduce him to my parents. So he hurried over to Saga. But then, there wasn't a right time to tell them. So he came with us. Do you want to meet him? Sure, call him over! Pochi! Mayu! This is Inuyama! My grandpa. Nice to meet you. I'm in your care. This is... What was your name? I'm ground staff, Okouchi. I found my ticket, can I get my voucher now? Sorry, we're out. Well? He's just like I described, right? He looks like a healthy young man. Not really young anymore, still. What do you think? What do I think? About Pochi! Be honest. How should I put it... I feel like he needs a makeover. What do you mean by that? I want to introduce him to the family. That's a good idea. Right now? I feel like destiny had a hand in this. What do you think? I don't think now is a good time to introduce them. Why? How do I say... timing? I don't think now is the right time. Really? Your father seemed to have a lot on his mind. Is that so? And, speaking frankly, I think your parents will be quite shocked. Is it my clothes' smell? It just happened to smell today. It's not because of the smell. Excuse me, but... Can I ask how old you are? I'm 46, why? And you? I'm 21, why? I'm 78, why? Well, no reason in particular... Age is not a problem if you're in love, but... I approve. No use worrying about age. Thank you, grandpa! Thank you, Grandpa! So, how did you guys meet? I worked at an internet cafe, and he was a regular customer! You looked at manga all day, right? Mayu went out of her way to bring me coffee, when it should've been me! If I'm being honest, I actually don't like it if you leave the drip coffee for too long. But you drink it all anyway. I drink it all! And afterwards, you even give me a curry rice! Excuse me! I think... You two! I think it's best if you take this one step at a time. It's not going to be good if you suddenly introduce him to your parents. You should greet the parents first, then... That's a pain! That's right, it'll be a pain, but I think it's a good idea anyway. And, excuse me, but, have you been married? Anyone at that age who hasn't been married yet is a turn off. I've been divorced 3 times. You shouldn't meet them today. Why is this person raining on our parade? That's not my intention. Pochi, now what? I'm fine, but... Isn't it fine? When will you get this chance again? Gramps! I don't know about Tanokura, but Miyoko will definitely like him. I think so too! Me too! Only you're against it. Well, I'm... I'm just an outsider, your opinions are more important. I'm fine either way. Mayu, I'm starving. Haven't you had lunch? She wouldn't give me the meal vouchers! There's a store on the second floor, let's go! Maybe there's bread! Let's go! There's a store over there as well. Thanks. Mayu! We're going. We're going! To be young again. Well, there's only one "young". Then, when the flight departs, I'll come get you. Please do. Excuse me. Hey! Come here! Quick! I had a long think, and it was good to turn him down. Turn what down? The proposal! Did you forget? A lot has happened today, honestly... Kaoru, life sure is interesting. Are you just going to ignore the proposal? Of course not, that's important. Right? Listen, "Don't bite the hand that feeds you." That's boring! Too boring. We should turn our eyes to the wider world! Are you listening? Don't act shocked, but I saw Kunikida just then. Kunikida... That Kunikida? That's right! Dressed like a pilot, riding so confidently on the escalator! What the hell that guy up to now? He really gives us a lot of trouble... Can you tell Jun? He should still be in the airport. Got it, I'll go. Thanks! Hey, worry about yourself, okay? Hey. Yes. Get me Tanokura. Tanokura. You understand, right? Yes, yes! Tell him Kurashina Yuriko wishes to speak with him. Understood. I'll be waiting outside. Okay. Excuse me. Just this once. Kunikida! Say that again. I dare you to say that again. What did you say, you bastard? I'll kill you! Excuse me. Mr. Tanokura, a moment, please. Me? My boss is asking for you. For me? I think he said, you both saw the same dentist in Tokyo. Then I'll have a chat. What about dad? Seems like he isn't coming. Look, I told you. Ms. Kurashina is waiting for you downstairs. I don't want to see her. My woman's intuition tells me, it's better to go see her. Really? Really. What the hell are you saying? Where's the stuff? Where the hell is it? Let's pretend we didn't hear anything. I didn't think she would be like this. She doesn't know you have a family? Of course not. I didn't hide it from her. Really? I told her from the start. Now look at me. I thought she would understand, but I suppose not. I thought she would be more reasonable than this. But this was my fault. I get that. So she followed you all here. Do you understand how horrified I was when I saw her at Saga Airport? Even though I did say we would see the Hot Air Balloon Festival at Saga... Hot Air Balloon Festival? She really likes it. Look, I get it's my fault. I have Mr. Tanokura for you. What is it? I want a smoke, give me a light. Now. I can get one at the store. This doesn't involve you. Thank you, you can go now. You called me here for that? Are you angry? Hey, let's go to Saga again in autumn. What are you saying? The Balloon Festival, I looked it up, it's in November. I can take leave now. Find someone else to go with you. How cruel! So cruel! Please, forgive me! Don't be like this, hey! It's my fault! My fault! My fault! What am I going to do with you? You're letting him off? Just look at how pitiful he is. I was just trying to apologize. To make up for it, kiss me. The heck are you saying? Now! Here? You're dreaming. Please! Is there somewhere we can go? The park around the back is usually empty. No way, no way, no way. Can I smoke here? Yes, it's fine. Got a smoke? I'd be grateful. Here. You really have one. I only smoke one a day. Hey, don't go. Let's chat. With me? You're free anyway, right? Here, for you. I could only eat two Tonkotsu ramen. Thank you. The weather hasn't changed at Haneda? I can confirm for you. Don't bother. No point in getting back early anyway. There's nothing good waiting for me in Tokyo. The more I hang around my sister's family, the more I feel my worthlessness. What have I accomplished so far? Do you have your own family? If you count a cat as family. A cat doesn't count. Then, I have none. My sister found herself a nice, straight-laced husband. Some sort of a lawyer. Their kids have all grown up, living their own lives. Compared to me... Though, in elementary, we were completely the opposite. I had good grades, and I was good at sports. I was an honor student. Really? I was on the sports festival committee! My sister's grades weren't good. She was overweight, and really scary. But it all ended in the autumn of the 6th grade. It may not look like it, but your blessed sister also has her own troubles. Not a thing. She has a good life, isn't that fortunate? It doesn't seem that simple. You're saying my brother-in-law is being unfaithful? That stuff will never happen to Tanokura! He's such a stiff, I bet you he'll never even find a mistress! I want money! You want to see a planetarium as well, right? Everyone loves a planetarium! Tanokura, lend me some money already! Is that a camera? Yeah, I work for a tabloid paper right now. Gossip column. I do some photography myself, so I usually have it with me. There's still time, would you like to take a walk in the park? Maybe you'll get some good pictures. I don't do landscapes. You should go anyway. I told you, I do celebrities. Would you let me fool you into going? Is there something really good back there? If you're feeling lucky... off you go! Okay! Tachibana! Ms. Miyoko. I'm sorry, I got your message a bit late. The shopkeep was busy, they could only get it to me just then. I should've told you directly, but you were with your family. I'm glad. Ms. Miyoko. Tachibana. I wanted to see you once again, no matter what. Me too. I didn't say it when we were in school, but... I feel like I can say it now. I've always been your admirer. Someone will see us. My feelings may be wrong, but... Tachibana... Don't you think we met here, because of fate? I think so too. Miyoko... What I'm about to tell you... You might hate me for it. What? Will you hate a man who comes on strong? I still have feelings for you. To tell you the truth, I was in Okinawa until yesterday, and my wallet was stolen at the hotel. That's terrible. No, no, they phoned me just then, saying they found my wallet. That's a relief. But... there was a bank card for the union inside. A union? The Pilot's Union. I haven't told you that I'm the accountant for the Pilot's Union, right? That's the first I've heard of it. Actually, we're planning a holiday trip together, and, today... we were supposed to pay the travel agency, but, I just lost my wallet. The account has been frozen, I can't take any money out. That's terrible. I'm so ashamed. There's only one hour until the deadline, I'm too ashamed, to ask this of you. How much do you need? It's on today, can you really? How much do you need? That's... Before you say it, I don't have much money on hand right now. 202000 yen. That's an odd amount. You really forgot. Doesn't matter what I say, it's still too shameful! So ashamed! It's okay, Tachibana. I received condolence money. You can't use that money! It's fine, an old acquaintance of mom's from Saga, gave me about the same amount that you need. No need to force yourself. Won't you get into trouble later? It's okay, only I know how much condolence money there is. I'm saved. Me too, I'm glad I could help you, it makes me happy. I'll get it right away. You're not going to hate me for this, right? Of course not. Miyoko. Sorry, I have to go. I have to get a vaccine shot! There's a disease, I have to get vaccinated! Don't you fly domestic routes? I'm flying to Sado Island next! I'm going to Sado Island! Sado Island? Do you need a vaccine to go to Sado Island? Damn, he got away again! Madam, madam. The man you were just talking to was a fake pilot. Don't let his appearance fool you. That guy is a conman known around here, by the name of Kunikida. Kunikida? Yes. I was scammed of 202000 yen before as well. He's handsome, so people just start trusting him. You've got the wrong person, I think. His name is Tachibana, he was a junior in my middle school. That's impossible! It couldn't have been another person! That was definitely Kunikida! Kaoru! Madam, are you alright? Listen up, you mustn't give money to him. Also, madam, we just received news from Haneda, the weather has improved there. We will be taking off shortly. Oh no! What have you decided? There isn't much time, so I will make the introduction later. Thank you for your input before. It's nothing, nothing. I have the meal vouchers, if you still need them. Do I look like I need them? I'm good, thanks. When we go upstairs, you can't talk to me, okay? You're so cute! I wish you two the best! Excuse me. Please hurry for the departure. Can you recommend a few tourist attractions around here, for her? Are you not returning to Tokyo? I want to see what's around before I return. See you. Tanokura, take care of yourself. You too. Until next time! Goodbye for now! Hey, what do you mean? I'll call you. Hey. Hey! The zero magnetic field power spot in Ina City is worth a visit. Can you tell me where it is? There's an information counter that way. Excuse me! Here. It's her, right? You're a godsend. Did you get some good pictures? Lots, now I can get some good money. That's great. Anyway, that guy sure can go at it! I agree. And, I recall meeting that woman. I met her at the hotel lobby in Saga too. I'll dig up some more once I get back to Tokyo. Kurashina Yuriko, dental hygienist. I heard they met at the dentists' in Tokyo. Are you a cop? Kunikida won't show his face again. Madam, please realize. He's a conman, a bad person. I knew that. I knew it. That man wasn't Tachibana. The Tachibana I knew... Even back then, he was 207 centimeters tall. Then, why? I've been married 22 years, I only live for my family now. When I get back to Tokyo, regular life will resume. Isn't it good? I thought... I would be foolish. Just this once. Miyoko, hurry up. But, it's over now. Okouchi! Finally, the weather at Haneda lifted! If it stayed like this, we would have to arrange bus and trains for them. Worse, we might have had to arrange accommodation for them. But thank god! Very lucky. Okouchi. Yes? Hurry to the passengers. I'll be going. Good work! Good work. Thank you. Leave it with me. Here I go! Go through. Thank you. Good work. Thank you. Here. Thank you very much. If we took off now, how long until we get to Tokyo? If you take off now, you will arrive at 4 o'clock. Awesome! What, you have a date? Not really. Tanokura. Last time... This again? 600,000, please! Were you deaf? I was hoping I can get the money today. How about when we get back to Tokyo? How many times do I have to turn you down? Mutsuo. Miyoko, please listen as well. Ah... Hey, Miyoko. Just tell me your bank account number. It's written here. But, I can only give you 500,000. There's also this. 600,000... And this. Doesn't your leg get tired in this pose? No, give it here. I'm not kidding, give it here! Please, delete it already! Hey, hey. If I had another 100k, I could build a better planetarium. I'll pay! Really? I love planetariums! I go everyday! Thank you! So please, delete it! After I receive the money. You better, brother. Of course I will. How can I lie to my little sister's loved one? That's rich, coming from someone who threatened the same person. Okay, trust me. People who love planetariums are good people. How did you know about this? I was walking around when I heard something strange coming from the grass. You just happened to be walking around there? You, did you tell him? What are you referring to? Only you knew, right? Okouchi, Okouchi, Okouchi, Okouchi. Yes. Excuse me. Bad news. Manager! Manager! Ow! Are you alright? To passengers on the Fuji Dream Airline flight to Haneda, may I have your attention. Flight FDA-532, to Haneda, due to weather circumstances, has been delayed again. What? Damn it! Please calm down! Sorry for the inconvenience, please remain patient for longer. So when do we fly again? We don't know. This is the worst! Why are you in such a hurry? Shut up! Is there something urgent? It's all over! He's so damn impatient, huh? Tanokura. Get up! Get up! Sorry. Mutsuo! Didn't you leave? You can't go back, right? I can't! Hurry up and go exploring! No way! Why? Mr. Tanokura. Your father has something to say. Tanokura. Please join him. Tanokura. I have something important to say. What is it? Important... no. What? It's nothing too big. What is it then? No, actually, it's quite important. Um... What? What is it? It's hard to find a chance, but I've been wanting to tell you all for a while now. And this seemed like a good time. Looks like the plane isn't taking off anytime soon, it should be fine now. Let's hear it, grandpa. What is it? About Tsuneko... Before I go on, I should use the toilet. I... What? I feel it coming a bit. Then, go. Nevermind, I can hold it. No, no, just go. The toilet is that way. Just go! Okay, let's go. No, actually, I'm fine. I decided, I have two pairs of underwear on anyway. No, you can't hold it in! It's better to go. Just, listen to me. We're listening. Um... Then, speak first. I have some... Ah, that's not it. Where was I up to? You saying it or not? Right, Tsuneko. Ever since my wife passed, I've been thinking this over and over. That is, about the days coming. That's right, mom's not here anymore. It's tough being by yourself, right? No, it's not that. Then what is it? Hear him out. Honestly... Me and Tsuneko were in an arranged marriage. It was our parents' idea. I can say now, that I didn't want it to be like that. The first time I felt that, I was more attracted to men than women, was when I was about 10 years old. When I went with my family to the sea bath in Imari, and I saw men in swimwear, my heart beat uncontrollably. But I didn't feel that way when I looked at women in swimwear. I thought, what's with that? And I knew that I preferred men more than women. Wait, what are you saying? Hear him out. But, it was different in the past. That type of thing was not widely accepted. So I've been silent the whole time. Even when I got married. I haven't told a soul. Of course, Tsuneko didn't know. She never did. So, today, I'm saying it for the first time. I... like men. Is this a sudden coming out? It's a coming out. No way. Then, did you not like mother? No, no, not at all. Tsuneko was my loved one, that's why I kept it from her. But, now that Tsuneko isn't here, I have no need to hide it anymore. From today on, I'll live openly. What do you mean, openly? Will you wear makeup? Will you be our grandma now? No, and don't stare like that. Explain it to them, please. It's not what you're saying. Listen, homosexual and transsexual are different things. It's only a mental thing with gramps. Just... he won't be wearing women's clothes. So, father, you're... Gay, right? That's right. I can't believe it. Don't overreact. It must've been hard for you to say that, gramps, I'm moved. Me too, grandpa. Live your own life from this day on! I think so too! Thank you! I'm not comfortable with this. What? I just feel like mom had been lied to this whole time, poor her. What are you saying? Gramps tried his hardest, right? You have to see that! It's only thanks to gramps' hard work that we're here today! It must've been painful for you. A little. Well, that... But, that... No, no, I always tried my best to love Tsuneko. But, in the end... Well, you know. You can't force some things. In the end, I couldn't love her. But, Tsuneko wanted children. So, at that time, I... To be able to, you know... I imagined a scene in my head. There was a man with a very solid chest at the convenience store near the station exit, his name was Ma-chan. Gramps! Stop! I don't want to hear the details! Sorry, sorry! What... But, it was good to say it out loud, right? You must feel a load off your chest. Thank you, but... I won't change much even after this. Hey, that's enough, right? I just can't accept it. What are you crying for? But that's my own problem. Time will heal all, right? I'm happy for you. Thanks. While we're here, I have something to say too. Are you sure that's fine? It's okay. I'm also coming out. Don't tell me, you as well... Pochi! Mayu! Sorry. Mother, father. This is Inuyama. Huh? He's my boyfriend. I'm Inuyama, pleased to meet you. What's the meaning of this? We're in a serious relationship. With him? That's right. He's a good, healthy, young man. You knew? I only told grandpa. He's got a nice chest. Father, please stop. I'm a bit confused, why are you here? He's been following us ever since Tokyo. But I couldn't find the right time to introduce him. So, with that, this is Inuyama, please take care of us. I'm in your care. How do you do, I'm her uncle, Kuranosuke. Hello. Wait just a minute! It's fine, anyone Mayu brings home is a keeper. Thank you, Uncle! I'm still confused. I'm saying, I'm going to marry this man! What the hell are you saying? What? No way in hell! I have to ask... 46 years old, divorced 3 times. No goddamn way! Dad! I refuse! Mom! I think I'm going to faint. How about you? That's why I said, don't spring it on them. You knew? Well, kind of. How come her own father didn't know, but someone working at an out-of-the-way airport knew? Who do you work for? What kind of question is that? Uncle, help me! Leave it to me. Tanokura, give them your approval. No way. Would these change your mind? And this? There's more. Give it back! Excuse me! What are you doing? Don't be dumb! The memory card will break if you get it wet! You got it wet! Don't bite it! It hurts! No, no way. Absolutely not. I do not approve of this! Passengers with Fuji Dream Airline, flight to Haneda, may I have your attention. Flight FDA-532 to Haneda Airport, the weather over Haneda has returned to normal, but due to an excess of flights attempting to land at Haneda, this flight has been cancelled. What the hell? We will proceed to process the flight cancellation, please make your way to the reception counter on the first floor. Everyone, let's go ahead first. This way! I absolutely do not approve! Can I go with you guys? My daughter is 21 years old! That's all! He's got a nice chest. Doesn't matter what kind of chest he has! Give me my memory card back! My memory card! Please take care. What should we do? Please, go ahead. I guess you have to take it step by step now. I told her before, I should've told them that she's carrying my child. She's pregnant with your child? That's right! That's something I'm good at. Do you have other children? This is my fifth. Never bring that up. But it'll come out eventually. Just don't tell them today! Let them all calm down, and find another day to tell them. Then, will you be there when we tell them, Ms. Okouchi? Do you think I'll be there? Right. Mayu, let's go. See ya. Bye. Let her be. If it doesn't work out, well, that's also a lesson for her. You can only say that because they're not your children. Haven't you seen how much I dote on your kids? Doting is doting. How would you understand a parent's feelings? Okay, let's go downstairs. How long is it to Tokyo by train? You have to get to Matsumoto Station, so, maybe 3 hours or more? What about a coach? Also around 3 hours. I'm screwed. Mind your step. Mutsuo, come here. Mutsuo, a word. What is it? What's with you tonight? What? I always felt something was off, you're acting weird today. I'm not. What about that suspicious call earlier? Not your concern. Answer me. Why do you need to get back to Tokyo so urgently? What's it to you? Excuse me, please consider the other passengers. My apologies. Let's move to the lobby. Watch for our luggage. Okay. Roger. I wasn't speaking to you. And stop holding her hand! Come. Dad is scary today. Really? What's happening? Explain yourself. I have an audition at 6pm today. Audition? What audition? A theater company. Theater? It's a famous one, but you wouldn't know. Famous? It's Mr. Makidai's one, right? Uncle, I knew you would get it! Why are you auditioning at a theater company? Isn't it obvious? I want to be an actor. You? That's the first I've heard of it. I'm going to be actor. I've made up my mind. When? A long time now. I've checked out a lot of theater companies, and this one suits me the best. I auditioned for a day last month, I'm the last of 10 people. Today's the second round. What about college? I dropped out last year! I think my brain is going to stop working. Mrs. Tanokura! Hang in there! Sit down! I'm fine. You quit school? I quit. I didn't hear about this! I'm not going. Waseda Business School doesn't help my acting. Do you have the skills to be an actor? I don't know! What will you do if you don't pass? All I can do is believe in myself! And on my first audition I got Mr. Makidai's approval! Who the hell is Mr. Makidai? Okay, I have an idea! I'll give you an audition, right now. What do you mean? Haven't I told you before? I used to be an actor. You, uncle? Really? When I was small. I starred in "Middle School Diary" twice! I picked up a lot of talent then. Do you have what it takes? We'll see here. Here? Now! Life is a stage! Then, please be seated. Excuse me? What is this guy talking about? Okay, just sit down. Grandpa, look up from the paper for a second. An good play is about to start. You prepared a scene for your audition, right? Then, let's do that, whenever you're ready. Okay, ready. Start! What the hell you saying? Do you want to die? Is this a goddamn joke? What the hell kind of crap is this? I'll fucking kill you! You asshole! Okay. Not bad. What the hell was that? Huh? Did you come to kill me? You've got some guts. Get back! Come at me, if you bloody dare! I don't want to die. I don't want to die. That's all. Cut! You pass. We're still rolling. Rolling. Listen up. Your acting needs a lot of work, but you're devoted. To be actor, the most important thing is devotion. Understood. Thank you very much. He'll be a great actor. What pass? I won't accept it! Amateur, what does he know. Listen, you'll get another shot. Okay. Just not today. I'll keep at it. And, when you got shot, that was a pistol? No, a knife. Oh, a knife? When you get stabbed by a knife... Hey, if you're in a rush to get back to Tokyo, I can get a helicopter. Helicopter? Yep. I can charter a helicopter. Can you get one here? Should be able to. I use it often. Takes maybe an hour back to Tokyo? That's great! If you take it, you can go straight to the theater. Won't you take it? But, won't that cost a lot of money? Well, of course, but it's only around 600,000 yen. Excuse me, but what kind of work do you do? Affiliate marketing, that is to say, net business. Net business? You're a man of the times! He doesn't look it, but he's actually rich! You couldn't tell, right? Well? Do you want to charter a helicopter? Please. Okay. Coming through. Excuse me, a helicopter, please. He's a rich guy! So what? He's a keeper! That has nothing to do with it. It'll be here in 5 minutes. Thank you very much! No worries. Great! You should've mentioned earlier that he's rich! He won't let me say it. Being rich isn't all there is to me, I just don't want people's impression of me to be based on that. I understand. I feel like we took a big step forward! Looks like I should've brought that up earlier. What big step? Mr. Tanokura. Well, if it isn't Mr. Tanokura. Do you still remember me? Of course, I do! And these are? My family; my wife, children, and co. Would you introduce us? She works at the dentist's that I always go to, uhh... Uhh... Ka... I'm Kurashina Yuriko. Thank you for taking care of my husband. Have we met somewhere before? Last night in Saga, at the hotel lobby? Where's that? I think you mentioned that this is your hometown, right? That's right! I'm born and bred from Matsumoto. And I just happened to run into you guys today. Is that so? Are you traveling with your family, Mr. Tanokura? Yeah, you can say that. Can I bother you for a minute? My wisdom tooth has been hurting since last night. That's not good. What the hell do you want? I didn't think we'd see each other again so soon! We really are tied together by the red string of fate. Give it a rest! Give me a kiss. What are you saying? Please! Didn't I kiss you before? Last one! But my family is right there. Is there any place that's convenient? The nursing room is that way. Come. Okay. If you tell anyone this time, I will make you regret it. Miyoko. Tachibana, these clothes... Don't ask. I didn't ask. 202000 yen, hold onto it. Okay? Madam. It looks good. Kunikida! Quick! Run! Found you! Ciao! It's him! Quick! After him! Get him! Hurry! Who's that? A friend from the women's college. Everyone! The helicopter has arrived! Everyone can fit, right? Can we fit? It can seat 5, should be fine. Where is my husband? I'll get him for you. The helicopter has arrived, please make haste. Am I going too? Of course you're going, just go! Yep. Then, everyone, please follow my lead. This way, please. Grandpa, you too. Okay. Gramps. Inuyama. Yes? Are you interested in planetariums? I love them! But, there hasn't been any good ones lately. I was thinking, isn't it about time for a few new ones? Mayumi, you found a great guy! Thank you! My luck is turning! I haven't felt like this since graduating from elementary! To be honest, it'll take another 3 hours to get back home in Tokyo. I feel a bit bad. Dear, Inuyama seems like a good person, right? I won't acknowledge him. Father? It's easy to get lost. Yes, right. Okay? I'm fine. What's wrong? Your face is red. No, it's nothing... Nothing, nothing. Are you tired? No. Excuse me. Please let them through. Please. This is so cute! Excuse me, can I take this? Sure. Thank you very much! We'll part ways here. Everyone, it's been a pleasure to serve you here at Matsumoto Airport. Thank you very much. Please visit us again. Thank you, Matsumoto Airport! Sis, aren't you coming? We'll go our own way. Hey, wait a minute. Besides, the helicopter can only take 5 people. I booked an airport coach earlier. I'll get your daughter back to Tokyo safe and sound. Really? I'd rather take that. Okay, let's go. I said it before, but I don't approve of you. Let's talk more next time. My daughter is only 21! If she was pregnant, that would be a different story. Enough already, let's hurry. Let go off my daughter. Honestly. Don't forget me. Dear. That woman with the Kansai accent came to see you off. I'll be off then. Goodbye. Next time, we meet as strangers. That... Bye bye. Bye. Let's have something before we go. Sounds good! Take care! Thank you for looking after us! Take care. You let him go quite easily, huh? Because he kissed me already. Huh, so you do keep your promises? If I don't keep my promises, when he breaks his promises, I won't have a leg to stand on, right? Ah, that's why. And, anyway, he'll be back for more. You're confident! Hey. What is it? Let's meet again in Tokyo. We'll decide what happens after that. Why? Didn't you say we wouldn't meet again? That's true, but... Next time we meet, you'll just be a patient to me. Anyway, let's meet once more in Tokyo. I'll call you. Then I'll change my number. Yuri-chan! I'll think about it. Then... Can you not stare? Take your time. See? Can I ask you something? Go ahead. What do you like about that man? I wish you could see, Tanokura's face under anesthesia when he was getting his teeth pulled. I don't think I really want to. I can't resist the face of a man in pain. So I always want to make it hard on him. I completely do not understand. Sorry for bothering you all. Ah, thank you. No problem. Where will you go now? Ina City's power spot. To acquire more power? See ya. Take care. Alright. I should have a break. I want to hurry home and take a bath... My shoulder is so sore. Alright. Kunikuda! What's that face? Before you do anything, I haven't done anything wrong today. Cosplaying isn't a crime, right? It's a free country. I guess you're right. The door will close. But anyway, that was a strange family, huh? Everyone has their own secrets. Is there someone who doesn't have one in this world? But, They didn't lie out of ill-will, they lied to protect the family. Having a family suddenly seems more attractive now. Those words don't suit you. But look, you're still quite beautiful, you know. You haven't changed one bit. Alright. See ya. Ah, right, about that lady, she saw through it, right from the start. The proposal... Should I accept it? This is the third floor. Manager. You didn't need to react like that. I was just thinking about you, Manager. About me? Yes, I've thought about it, and maybe it's not immediate, but I'll think seriously about what you said. But, I'm just thinking, weighing the options, that's all. Please don't misunderstand. Actually... I... Hey, what are you doing? Get back to work. I'm sorry, the wind is just such a cruel mistress. Huh? Well, the Tanokuras just boarded the helicopter. I see. What's up with you? Nothing. There's something I need to tell you. What is it? Actually... Mr. Muraki purposed to me! And, I think I'll say yes! Sorry for saying one thing and doing another. Ah, is that right? I think you two are very compatible. I'm happy to hear you say that. It's early, but we should be done with the process within the year. His mother is not doing well. And I want to let her rest easy. I see. I didn't think happiness was beside me all along. You have to work hard as well! I'm sorry. It's okay. Let's go. Any woman would do, huh!? What was that? What was all that? Oh, that was so embarrassing. Take care! English Translation by Timothy L
