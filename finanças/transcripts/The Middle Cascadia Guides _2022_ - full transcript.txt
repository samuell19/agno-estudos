Hello everybody. My name is Terry Linch. In with Oregon Ufology Um. I found myself. Searching for a passage way one day. And that passage way leads right across A section of the Cascades. Which I'm sitting at the moment on top of Paulina Peak. I wanna make sure that everybody sees... The type of things we find in the process of research. For ufology. I've located a... Couple that's sitting here on top of Paulina Peak. She's facing south, he's facing north. Both of them are an elongated skull... Just Just like a... Grey Alien. Hi. My name is Terry Linch, I'm with Oregon Ufology. The process of my research. I found this location. As I was uh... Searching for satellite imagery. And I ended up locating this Thing that I like to call.. The Cascadia Guide. Alright. Its a male and a female with elongated skulls. This thing has been here.. In gonna say for probably 5.. to 6 thousand years. Trying to make sure that we get a good accurate detailed thing of this report of this area. That there. These are the guides... cascadia guides. And that right there is Diamond Peak off to the side and that is also if you look very close You will see there is also Crater Lake In gonna get after facing the sky I'm after.. UFOs But when you get to the mountains What's going on here within the mountains. Is..their taking and using the Rosenbridge the mountains.. Seems to be..the.. the home of these things the harder the more complicated it is to get to. That's where were gonna be finding these things. Where its almost impossible for people to walk around. If your uh.. If your on a jagged cliff area of any mountain or volcano any riffs that are really hard to walk through places where were not gonna be that's where they are And they go into the earth they live inside the earth. They... are constantly above us in the sky And were actually..were the thing in the middle we live in the middle of this whole settlement. No matter where you are on the planet Your in The Middle Oh there is some good pictures of the flow here. Yeah I got some pretty good pictures of this flow the big flow on top of Paulina I cant wait to analyze some of the film you took on top of the paulina peak. To see what kind ugh.. Things were passing by us while we were up there. That's gonna be ugh.. Interesting to see with your cam because yours is a little more technical than mine. You can shoot in faster faster speeds than me. With your Sony um..I'm really curious to what..what a.. Happens when Chris Hamall gets a hold of that footage Starts to uh.. show us what Seems like every time I take uh any kind of video footage on top of Paulina Peak.. Uh Mr Hamall in Australia seems to find everything that comes out of the sky. In really looking forward to uh.. Him getting hold of research and what he's done with mine I wanna see his research And.. now that we have.. A camera of the caliber of Alien Strand... has brought and LEDZ entertainment has brought up to this area the possibilities are limitless on this. Um.. You guys have definitely shown me that I need more than Nikon I need some Sony. My goal is the P1000 its a 3,000 mm camera. Ill be going back up to the top of Paulina Peak with that. At some point And I will be aiming towards Mt Shasta I can actually see what's coming out of the mountain from Mt Shasta. Um.. I have this long run that ill be able to track and that's a couple of hundred miles but ill be able to track with the P1000 from Mt Shasta all the way along the cascade line it goes all the way out to Mt Adams from Washington state. This one is the one I got the Tic Tac craft with. It was passing overhead..I had this focused in on a uh.. Jet that was passing by with a chem trail. Behind it. I use jets for chem trails as a beacon..its a place for me to focus. Once I focus in on that um..the craft will pass You don't sit here and look around like this for the craft what you do is set and set in one spot. You don't move from that spot Tripods are king with these things. Everyone of us is going to have full communication up on top the uh.. Of the mountain Were using Motorola handhelds I got 3 of them Jonathan has 2 himself. Jonathan's are all this kind Um..his are a little bit newer than mine but we got uh..we all have the exact same.. Radios..so we can stay in contact because we are gonna be on top of uh of a mountain 8000 feet up... in the middle of the wilderness Here's... here is part of the plan were gonna go ahead and go down to uh.. First were gonna go up to the top of Paulina Peak were gonna go up to the cascadia guides A little bit later were gonna go down to Hole in the Ground And were gonna look at a mile wide crater in the earth in central Oregon. This is..this is right on the edge of central Oregon heading towards eastern Oregon and what we refer to as the Oregon outback. We will be looking directly at Paulina Peak from the east side of Paulina Peak. This is a location where almost every time I go there to film I end up getting craft flying over the top of it they usually move pretty fast when craft move over this its usually at 22 miles per second about as fast as blink your eye I guess the past couple of years been hanging out with Terry and kinda giving him a little bit of wilderness backup I guess you can copy and talk about You know we go out. We hit the woods we hit the mountains..uh I've always made it a goal to find the top of every butt I find out here so... that's kind of what we've done When me and Terry met he kinda chipped right to the same thing you know lets go to the tops of buttes because I can use that as a vantage point I like it just because it a beautiful scene out here. You know Terry..Terry kinda strung me on to that next side. That next uh... piece of what were investigating and watching the skies. Uh so.. I guess my ultimate job is to get Terry where he needs to be Get him the best view on the sky.. And uh.. Watch his back for the most part We are in the wilderness we are in the great..Oregon outback here... so uh you know..we got a little bit of wildlife to worry about gotta keep everyone safe... on their toes Oh hell yeah I love going out just being in the woods. Most of the time like he said I go out ride around try to memorize each trail just by the way it looks.. the way it goes.. where it ends up. How I get there. But ..yeah Its..its a lot of fun especially with a lot of people if I go out with like a group me and my dad go out with some other people Its always a blast just to go out and have some fun That's what you get no go ahead. What's that? Again why are we armed? Sooooo.. I always take everything in the Oregon outback all the same. Its all wilderness..its all wild animals. So.. In not expecting to go out there and draw arms on people..and such. But I do not go out in our wilderness without some kind of side arm for protection And this was the first time. Uh... this..this Cascadia Guides has ever been documented. We are the very first people to document we've looked everywhere..there's nobody.. Has ever documented that. Then ...maybe an airplane flew over and took a picture Maybe a hiker stumbled..stumbled upon it at some point but you don't see anything. You can just stay to the side so you don't feel like your gonna fall off. In a little more mountain goaty so... Ill get out here. Ok... well this right here gives you a shot right down to the volcano itself. Your literally looking here.. At he side of the mountain that blew out. This giant crater here is 2 lakes here.. There's Paulina Lake and East Lake. This area here is bigger than crater lake by far. This volcano is the largest volcano in the cascade mountain range. Um... the last time this volcano erupted was 6000 years ago. This is a very short period of time that this volcanoes... been dormant as a matter of fact its not dormant. Were starting to have earthquakes underneath this volcano USGS just reported one 2 weeks ago Yep this is a caldera what were looking into is a big caldera. Um..In literally, In standing on the edge. Of the volcano Sheer cliff right here drops down uh..about 1000 feet. Various different types of wildlife up through here. Last time I was up and out the cascadia guides I I physically seen a bear walking up that there's a hill over there on the side of it and I saw it going up the side of that as soon as I saw the direction it was going.. I went the other way. Just a wise thing to do. They don't like being pet.. Just like the buffalo in Yellowstone, you don't pet them. In Jonathan Mitchell with Oregon Ufology and were here at the top of Paulina Peak. Just kinda sharing some stories about uh. what we see winter time up here. Uh..behind Terry here is an elevation sign. Kinda a good marker there the snow is usually at.. or above that when were mid winter Uh..so.. Really a cool area to be up here summer and winter to ride to the top here... we were sharing a story we watched a guy ride this crater with a snowmobile out along the edge here. Pretty sketchy look..this is a pretty steep bowl. Uh.. seen some pretty cool adventures up here I hope to see some more as we uh.. Proceed down the trail and... down the mountain and into the bowl. Isn't that clear down You know what its like to hide a rock in a bunch of rocks ha ha. Native Americans would see that.. type of thing. And to them they would say the last steps a doozy.. There it is. Jinga Those things will stand up like that. Its really weird how that works. There it is. Right on! Next earthquake its a goner though. Next breeze of wind! That's pretty cool. good balancing John. That's cool. That's a nice little build right there. Ooo that actually looks pretty tall from back here. It does! It looks really neat when you got the lava flow behind it or the..obsidian flow behind it. You know. That's a really cool contrast there. Nice work. Ok Come on guys, follow me to the cascadia guides ..were here. Their right here. There they are. Look at that! He's facing north, she's facing south. Did he say? These are the Cascadia Guides. I have uh video footage. Of uh..2 craft dropping straight out of the sky and their coming along, and I have them moving up the ridge line like this. Up high and then they drop back down to this V which is a clear view of the Cascadia Guide. Uh when these craft did this One of the craft turned up on end And it threw out a light. Indicating that the craft could see this. And that's what let me know That this right here was something from them. Somebody's gonna try and put up their hand and say I did this. Um.. If you did this then you were also in that craft that turned up on end And ..signifying you were turning here. Um..those craft were slowed down they were moving. Pretty close to 22 miles a second The speed of these craft are so hard to see sometimes you just don't even realize it I mean literally They could be passing over the top of my head within feet And I wouldn't know it was there. Neither would you. As these things pass us.. We... We.. Sometimes you feel like your being watched or something like that That's why your feeling that. These things move so fast And they hide from fusing this speed and that technique It doesn't matter... it doesn't matter how big it is or how small it is You can move an aircraft carrier at 22 miles a second and you wont see it. Lets go Terry here real quick. Back up just a little bit. We can kinda guess work here. On top. Kinda give us over all. The male subject From head to toe. In sitting position is 33 feet. The female subject.. From cranium to foot. In sitting position... is.. Right at 28 feet In also giving you a reading from head to hand. This is just a little bit off ..but north North is.. Exactly this way. So on the Cascadia guides I an extremely grateful that I ended up meeting a expert by the name of Ken Wells Jr. he goes by K.B.Wells Jr. Uh..he an author and written several books on just this subject. I cant wait to find out what his analysis is. He's waiting to see what my measurements are. And to get back to him with that. Um. He.. Was pretty amazed with this and I cant wait til..til we get his two cents... because This is definitely an ancient thing. My name is Ken Wells.. In an author a researcher and have been looking at petroglyphs and pictographs rock art along the south west for over 20 years. My journey first started... really how all journeys start..is with a shifting of consciousness Was 9 mile canyon in Utah. Which is a beautiful drive, with rock art on both sides. Of the... of the road... and uh.. Rock art just speaks to you it changes you. I know there's one person that I ever came across that have not been changed Uh..not by looking at a book necessarily. By encountering, searching, finding uh..rock art and having it speak to you. There is a lot of different reasons for this there is all different types of rock art. Around the world, ancient Egypt Gobekli Tepe Australia, Italy, Spain cave art its everywhere..and these images and symbols they have the power to bypass our usual channels of understanding and meaning to speak directly to consciousness. And that's where my journey started That's where Terry's journey started as really in fact, that's where all journeys start. Is where you have an expansion of consciousness.. a trigger and that takes you to places you would never ever imagine you would go. We lived in a very small town In the Sierra Nevada mountains near Yosemite and that's where the early visitations from what... some call extraterrestrials. Uh began.. It journeyed through electronics, computers through psychic seminaries ghost hunting adventures various kinds of explorations in technologies Such as free energy healing like rife machine uh Laskouski coils and then eventually into rock art symbology, muldevite semiotics is the study of how meaning is generated in the mind. But when your ..when your looking at symbols rock art, or your touching something brings symbols to your mind like muldevite Meaning is derived directly away from consciousness..its not what you learned and its not what you've been told Its what your consciousness perceived. And that's a whole different deal and that's exactly what I think happened to Terry when he had his encounter his mind was ready for a change.. His body maybe not so much.. Bus his mind was ready for a change..and then he came across rock art uh and petroglyphs and they started to speak to him in different ways..it happens a lot uh.. my thoughts on the geoglyph totally stoked I think we have a lot of information here uh.. a good amount of measurements, angles Id like to get home draw this out map it out see if we get some correlation..maybe some transferable information onto a map uh..or a constellation we'll see where it points and where it leads. The heads are facing directly toward the Grand titons over in Wyoming We have a friend that's part of this endeavor She's a Ufologist names Shanna Gilms out of Twin falls Idaho and she's just South of a what they call Craters of the Moon Idaho any time you see lava flows..your gonna find these craft they like to go in and out of them its part of how they get in and out of the Earth. So anyway she has a large majority of craft circling her area and they give her a nightly visit in the Idaho Falls area. Uh..she's on the other end of the Cascadia Passage and she's a welcomed part to uh.. Share her stuff inside of the middle..because she is in the middle. I see something here that uh.. Looks like somebody broke this rock.. fractured it.. There's a fracture..I was just wondering what would be underneath it. So this kinda.. kinda resembles a It looks .. it looks to resemble a sphere. Like a one of the round craft. In gonna assume of what this is..because its definitely not a seeping circle. There's uh.. too many rocks in the middle of this. This represents something and its actually within eye sight of the cascadia guides. Actually kinda surprised that this is here I didn't..I didn't notice the last time I came in. And I hadn't paid attention to it on satellite imagery. You know I know I flew the drone pretty high I've might of got it on drone..and you can probably see it. Yeah were under 100 yards.. I think your gonna have this on drone. I bet you there's more stuff up that way So maybe what... the other one is pointing to? It could be .. I bet that ones pointing at this and that ones probably pointing at another one like this on the other side. Its a possibility... It could be... There's more to adventure up here that's for sure. And we sound.. We got a rolling tape that will go to a mile. Do you? So we can map these a little bit further..especially if we find another one. Yeah..if there's another one of these? What that make this This and that... and that's the size of the Glyph. So ill be curious to see Terry if we venture a little more higher up on these rocks to a higher point..see if we don't Climb over a visual point that looks over our geoglyph here. But maybe explains more about our geoglyph. Up on the rocks.. whether its a glyph or a drawing. Yea correct.. if we look close like out of a Uh just southeast of us here. There's a giant glyph on the ground..a geoglypy on the ground what you just explained basically that's the same thing. They got a petroglyph right on the wall and up behind it there's miles of this giant geoglyph is the exact same thing that's the Elk... the elk oh I'm sorry.. that's the Antelope heart mountain refuge out on Flook Lake... sure.. Which also happen to be under the lines of the Cascadia Passage Alright..Were smack in the middle of Windago Trail The windago trail starts from the windago pass Just south of us and it goes all the way north of Mt Jefferson. This right here was a safe passage way for most of the native Americans. They were trying to stay away from the white people just over the mountains. In Bend.. they could..they could either trapping or trading and all kinds of things through here. So what they have here is the windago this windago is a warning.. even to Indians. When they see this guy... they know that there are cannibals in the area and there's a possibility you gonna get eaten.. So... don't.. Be messing around in the area..you didn't wanna be here in the middle of the night. What this is telling you. This is a warning..don't be here at night. We are directly underneath the cascadia passage right now. Uh... This is a line that goes from Mt Shasta in California..that direction. All the way to Mt Adams in Washington state that direction. And were directly underneath that passage line Which means if you pint cameras up here your more than likely to see a craft going by. And you'll have to slow the footage down because they are going pretty fast. Um... sometimes you get to see them going real slow.. Sometimes you get to see them going real fast. Hello I'm Eric..from Bend, Oregon. I have a couple of kids and wife. Wever been here.. Really we were here in central Oregon since 2015. I've had several experiences over the years.. They don't ever feel like their connected cause its been a lot of time and distance..but The more I realize it there's more going on there. The first time we ever experienced any kind of UFO or whatever you want to call it. I simply ended up with missing time.. Uh.. I was driving down the road.. I knew where I was headed. And then like... the blink of an eye. Me and the guy that was driving the car were looking at each other What just happened That was weird.. That's when we realized a couple of hours were missing. And we were a couple of hours down the road. But like our watches our time had only been like... seconds less than a minute I've still never been able to explain that but that was like my first experience where.. I was like... what just happened. One when I was driving back from Washington up on highway 97 coming back down into Border from Washington, Oregon and there was... I..I..I don't know what to call it..like a.. A block in the sky.. It was lighting up the fence line.. Like you could see the sheep on the fence line.. And when we looked back on the pictures we had taken ..you can see.. That, that's what was lit up..but there was no sound. It just went ..went like large impending object Just kinda tracking along side of us.. I do believe that the mountains are energetic in some way and definitely attract attention. They attract people..they attract what else is going on. And so there is definitely a lot to that. You can feel it when your in the mountains. And I believe there is definitely something more Its that next level of consciousness if you will. Where they are aware.. Become aware..of.. of a different reality Reality that exists side by side uh.. with our current one. And you see a lot of the same kind of experiences happen with..uh.. People that witness UFOs.. People that are abducted by UFOs extraterrestrials..people that are abducted by extraterrestrials. Yo have the same kind of click Or... or Skakbuku in consciousness... that swift. Spiritual swift kick to the head. That will alter your perception forever. My names Kimberly. I live in Bend, Oregon Been here for about four in half years..came here right after the solar eclipse in 2017 soon after And I was born it Wichita. And I lives in Arkansas a very long time. In not sure about my first encounter, but the most impactful you should focus upon. I've never seen anything like this and I was.. Gobsmacked May 25th of last year. Paulina Reservoir That's also a place pretty well known for folks that reveal here. For the Eclipse..um were there..and I always heard there was a lot of activity. I just decided I wanted to go somewhere one evening me and a friend. We had just met. Went to go check Paulina Reservoir knowing the area well and everything..and I said I've never been there lets go. And I've heard about activity.. While we were there .. I found a mistletoe.. we had just met Don't mind the things I say for comedic affect. Uh.. but then this huge ship appeared! It was filmed that night.. for.. It was there for hours and hours.. witnessed by many people throughout Oregon and Washington. Bird..birds and bugs don't put out an EMF. Aright..I uh.. If your wanting to find out the difference you have to get the filters. I have some filters that I use myself for a.. When I take still shots... And I put filters on to see if any type of field around it.. I put on infrared filters to see if there is any field around it. These things also show the different heat sources. An EMF around the craft is almost visible to the eye sometimes. You can also watch the magnetic flux tubes. As they bend under the craft If you see it bending this way.. it means the craft is moving this way. If they bend this way they are going that way. Straight up and down..probably going straight up.. But... with ...with the filters. You can see these things move... you can see..the .. the around the craft You can see a magnetic field.. Around it... that's called.. That magnetic field is called a magnetic flux basket and that's how the craft is held inside the basket. Inside those magnetic tubes that are going between the earth. And up the ionosphere. Chris Hamall in Australia... this is the guy that when I do all my filming..this is the guy my go to for. For a... having my film filtered.. Having slow the stuff down even more than I did when I did my settings he slows it down even more and he shows how the craft are coming in from out of the sky My name is Chris Hamall... I uh live in Australia New South Whales New Castle My expertise in the field is I'm a sky watcher.. These days they call them a Ufologist. I also do analysis on UAPs and footage from all over the world. And I've also had my personal experiences in the last few years. In a father of 3 beautiful children and a husband to a beautiful wife. In a business owner. In also a accomplished musician. An award winning musician. Myself and my wife have experienced..uh. Seeing something really unusual in the sky. Um..I guess uh.. All the things that run through your mind is it a plane or helicopter..what could it be I guess uh.. In life you sure know what a helicopter or a plane is so when you see the lights up to 15 lights in the sky flashing and doing all kinds of weird stuff give you a very uh.. Euphoric feeling of something unusual is going on You always cant believe what you are seeing.. When it comes to analyzing footage..I use different filter software to help enhance the footage to see thing like the ultra magnetic field Um... also obviously the contrast and things like that so you can bring out things you cant see with your eyes This does help and assist the process of analyzing footage Other equipment that I use for analysis cross referencing for my own sightings..I use Satellite trackers. I use flight navigation trackers... just to make sure I guess to eliminate..its not a plane, satellite a way to start analyzing footage from other people from around the world.. I use all different filter equipment. Which is to get the red and stuff like that which is still in the process My name is Valentio gallegos. In over here on the Hilo Reservation just south of Phoenix... I'm 33 years old Gonna be 33 I'm 32. I've been filming for about.. 4 years now.. I filmed all over the valley from Kingman to Tuscon almost all the way south of Douglas I've been.. I literally caught UFOs everywhere. I've always been interested ever since I was a kid. Just watching shows about them. And.. I've seen.. I have my own uh. Sightings and stuff like that every now and then. Then .. like I said I was on the road a lot for work so... In sitting passenger almost half the time. And there is nothing to do for hours at a time. So I started recording out the window. And as you know I started catching a lot of stuff, researching the areas that were hot spots I just started picking up on how to uh.. Or where all the active areas were at.. When I seen my fist sighting I actually seen a whole fleet of them. Me, my Mother my Grandmother. My Uncle and my Nephew all seen a fleet of them.. When I first seen them.. I seen one flying near an airplane I went inside got my mom. I was like I need you to come check this out real quick. I don't know what it is.. When I went out there to show her.. there was more of them. We walked on the side of the house you can see at least .. what I can say..100 of them. 100 of them in the sky ..we all seen them. They were there for a good hour almost hours all of them doing different..different maneuvers ..everything Some were just being still..some were going sideways. There was triangle formations.. Everything..it was crazy. It took a little while a little while to really I'm starting to catch them all. Or seen a lot of activity And..I don't know its almost like drawn to them or ..they..they wanted me to see them. Or... or um.. There just always..but then when I payed attention the feeling just to look up. I always seen like something in the sky. I use a couple of different ones the only thing I ever do is just bring it out..try to bring it out more and I filter it so people are able to see it. And just to slow it down so people are able to catch it. Because a lot of the times they are very very fast. and if you don't know what your looking for You not gonna see it at all.. I have a lot of people try to tell me oh wow I didn't catch it .. I didn't see it.. Or what you talking about.. But then I.. I always try to share the slow motion video first. Or screen shot of what I caught.. then slow the video. Then ill show the original video at the original speed. And um.. people ever catch it. Phoenix .Arizona is literally in the top 5 almost every time And I see it every year a city ..uh.. Is up there with the top 5 maybe number one. And I know it would be a lot more if I reported my stuff too. I know it would be a lot better. Not too far from where were at right here on the other side of the mountain. There is a place called Stardust Ranch... where a guy.. a good friend..named John Edmond..he passed away. Or he got a lot of activity where he was getting visited by small grays My... experiences are different than everybody else's. Uh. there is people that have dreams..other people get abducted or.. Or... or just some of its bad when they do get abducted.. I talked to other people who have told me the stories. And experiences, but I think every one is just different when they have or when they made contact with them and stuff like that. Mines just..mines just different. My name is Elizabeth Jeffries and I live in Pecos, New Mexico I did see one event early on when I moved into the home in 2006 Um the only reason I remember it.. It was right before my anniversary. And I found it strange..well I was asleep and my dog was barking out of control it woke me up..I was startled and I went to the front window.. To see what was going on and I wasn't sure what was happening. Uh.. I thought there were kids playing out there maybe in a vehicle..driving around..uh on the grass I just wasn't sure of what was happening. So.. it was cool outside..its cool in April And I uh..opened the door. And uh. I also remember all the other dogs that were barking. But that point.. I thought so what the heck's going on? So I went outside and I couldn't fugue out why all the dogs were barking. Well this light that I had been watching for a couple of minutes started getting closer and closer.. But what I noticed was a huge uh..beam of light and I couldn't tell where the light was coming from..at first I thought. That must be a.. Police officer..maybe they have helicopters but there was no noise.. Uh.. I looked up at the sky..it was dark I couldn't even see the stars that night.. And I couldn't understand what the problem was or why the dogs were so out of control. I didn't hear a fire department, engines or anything like that. So they just kept on barking and barking and I thought I don't know whats happening but something weird is happening. So as I started to look at the lot. I noticed that the beams of light were coming in and they were bouncing so it was oval in shape and I couldn't tell tell how big it was until it got close enough.. At that point I got kind of excited. Because I thought if its not a helicopter... then what is it. As I saw the lights from the window Um..the light in the field at the time was completely vacant... a vacant lot. So there was no development what so ever. So as I started walking across the road. I was bare footed mind you. So I notice the lights were getting.. they were oval. And it looked like it was coming straight down off the ground. So as I was looking up at the sky thought it was a helicopter at first And..I thought for sure someone was being chased there was nothing there..there was no sound..so it was pitch dark that was another thing. So typically the stars are very bright.. they look bright out here and I couldn't see anything. The dog was going insane howling and I kept looking up at the sky..so I decided to start walking And I walked all the way across over here and as the lights were bouncing all the way. It was like they were searching for something and I didn't know what they were searching for. You could see every blade of grass.. it was very very bright So... as it got closer and I noticed it was right here. And it must have been the light was hitting right here. I saw it and I stood right here and thought do I want to walk into the light.. Probably not. I wasn't sure... I got a little.. A little worried about that I wasn't sure what was gonna happen. Because of the uh.. The idea of What am I looking at? There's no noise. I don't see a craft Is it a UFO? Is it all in my head? Or um.. Why am I the only one seeing this... nobody else outside..was by myself And I was hoping that my husband was gonna come out outside to see what was happening but he never did. Came out the door.. it was just me. So um needles to say as the lights would go they would bounce on off..on..off..on.. Until it got to the edge of that other home on the end there then it finally just stopped..and then... it went away. So it was a little unnerving. To say the least and I finally decided to call MUFON Not call them but actually wrote email to let them know about the event Because I wasn't sure if anybody else had reported it. Most ofter I have come across people that their lives are changed from that point If their mind is ready as Terry's was and they see that image. Its communicated past directly into their consciousness..it doesn't go through what they learned in school or what they saw on television It really goes back to you know the source we're all connected through consciousness. I've been working.. I started in ufology 2019.. We ..after I had seen and witnessed my uh My CE3 I decided I needed to find out more about this. I spend a lot of time trying to a understand what I had seen in the sky. This thing was very close to me. And I had to figure out how that worked. So.. Immediately I started listening to Dr Leonardo Suskein uh..hes a Hes the lead theory physicist in the world uh .. hes also the director of Stanford University physics department He .. he gives uh.. Two in a half lectures for free.. On the internet.. all you have to do is have two in a half hours. Well if you take that science and mix it to the science were seeing these craft perform. Its basically the same thing. We do have this technology. In the form like CERN Where we send out hydrone particles different directions. Uh.. were using hydrogen in case them so they will move at this speed. And when you look up and see a jet its got the hydrogen cone around it These guys are starting to break into something Ok they're not actually there..but they're starting to break into it. Their uh.. Like the craft will be a complete white ball you'll see complete white ball moving.. That means moving at a speed that... is cutting through the vapor in our air and cutting through the hydrogen creating and encasing it inside of a ball And now your seeing this thing move across like lightning. Or.. You'll see it slow down then all of a sudden like a yellow or orange ball going fast. Because its moving at a forward speed. Or when their moving at full speed the TIC TAC craft the navy is chasing. Those tend to have to cones on them Was 100 percent correct he was talking about Ununutainium 115 Looking this stuff up anyone can find this information looking this stuff up you find out when you bombard this material 115? To radiation.. What he says its a... Amplifier.. Well when he says amplifier..what pops into my mind magnetrons ..just like in your microwave oven Uh.. that magnetron is a nuclear Ad what its doing its taking the molecules in your food by vibrating them. At frequencies of microwave frequencies And its turning the things inside hot out. So.. what it does..it disrupts the molecules and that's hoe..everybody has a nuclear device in their homes by now just in the form of a microwave oven. Magnetic flux tubes that are going down are acting as wave guidelines and what their doing is their shooting... D1 sharp .. the sound D1 Sharp.. Kind of a low hum... hmmmmmmm that you can get when your You can hear this from the craft..everyone says their silent. A lot of people hear the hum. Ok.. this hum What it is their slowing down the intervals of it when they want to slow the craft down When they want to speed up turn up those intervals and the craft can move Right at relativity. One of the key factors to this location Hole in the Ground and off in thew distance you see Paulina Peak. Right at that top where we were earlier today. Where you can see the Cascadia guides. Well this is one of the locations their guiding them to. This is another landmark on the ground almost you can see from a long ways up. This Hole in the Ground is 1 mile across you see Paulina peak off in the distance right there. And those craft I have I have photos of some from that location directly over I have 2 of them. Oh ..I got a fuckin nucleus and everything on this. I am stoked man.. Its got a nucleus. Every once in a while I get flicker just past it. This is cool shit. Man what a good spot..what a good spot. What happens here is you got this..the whole thing had water on top of it. It was a big volcano. Underneath. And what happened was the heat superheated the water and collapsed. Right into the ground. I would like to come out here with um.. Some equipment to check the magnetism levels as well as the radiation levels at this site because down inside of there I believe craft are going in I believe they are going into the center of this and into the earth. I believe they are also doing it by Fort rock as well as up at Paulina Peak. Other petroglyphs their just a stone throw away actually from Paulina Peak. Fro. the guides. Is near long lake and those before Winamuka Lake was dated. Those were actually are the oldest ones to be in North America. Just a stone throw from the peak. And those were dated to be six to seven thousand years old. so it varies a lot. Whats even more interesting you start to look at it globally You know where there are cave paintings that go back have been dated because of the pigments used and the preservation of the of the material. They go back 30 to 40 thousand years So there's definitely a there's definitely a shift that has to happen And how we think of time We think of time what we learned in the 6th grade text book but that's not time at all. So when you talk about and think about time in terms of petroglyphs. And you bring in the extraterrestrial visitation you really have to take the whole picture into account. Because there's a very good likely hood that there was a very advanced civilization On this planet that was ended by this event. By the Younger Dryas impact that happened 15 thousand years ago. And they preserved it the best they could by burying the story.. right um.. And its wonderful they did it in rock just like the ancient Egyptians did. Because had we found a compact disk and or somebody's iPod from that time it wouldn't have meant very much to us ..but Again.. their speaking in symbology. A language that speaks to consciousness And so they were aware enough that was the only way they were going to communicate that message. When the craft came over the top the the one craft flipped on end it lit up. Directly over the top that looks like 2 back to back aliens They look like large Greys Uh.. me and my team were up in the mountains researching on this... we did measurements We took measurements of the entire thing Volcanoes are the big key to these UFO's That's why I got so involved with the geology of it I wanted to learn more about the volcanoes around me their hiding in. My name is Donald Ledesma owner and host of Alien Strand Podcast Been doing podcasting now for 4 years on UFO's Alien abductions ufo encounters and everything of the unknown. I came across Terry's story about 3 years ago When he showed me a find on top of Paulina Peak that something that looks like 2 aliens that are back to back. Very strange rock formation And then..he sent me photos of ufo craft he was catching in the general area. We started putting 2 and 2 together and figure out that mountains the geological aspect there in Oregon all on the western side of the United States have a lot to do with UFO encounters So now at this point we've gotten footage from Jodi Gordon Anibal Caballero... Chris Hamall Tino Gallegos Shanna Gillmer A lot of these folks have caught these crafts in the sky. And way above these areas of mountain peaks We feel that... Mountain peaks..Ufo's Petroglyphs..geoglyphs all connect together as one. Why their connected together But until now its up to us to figure out as ufologists what were gonna do. And how were gonna do it. And I believe were on the right track. I think their gonna start realizing maybe there is something to this. Alien deal..I mean and you know They always talk about different aliens and there's different forms. And uh..Yeah why not believe it. I think that anyone looking at a documentary gonna say WOW there's people out there seeing these things or that have observed it or really kinda put 2 and 2 together Thar maybe uh were not the only ones here. When watching documentaries one of the biggest thing is hearing peoples stories. When people are more comfortable to share theirs Because I think a lot more people have been describing And that's what we hear It is a big thing to talk to one another. You talk about Anytime your searching for the truth I think its gonna come out one way or another. I am surprised as far as people feeling accepted to open discuss proof... Overall. Consciousness we see and interact with today verses the consciousness that really exists that we are shielded from. Because of our awareness I think the very same thing applies to extraterrestrial visitation They are the same kick to our consciousness That kick that changes our perception forever. I want people to see that.. To work and see the good in them. The good and the bad that come out of it but mostly the good once we all we are always our level of consciousness first before were able to make contact with them or they are able to make contact with us We .. We.. Put the compass on, we wanted to make sure definitely he was facing yo the north Making sure she was facing to the south We got a pretty good reading on how large everything was. We got some pictures now for size I put my.. we had my team get a picture of the top of it so you can actually see how big this is. From the bottom of the guides the Cascadia Guides. This little V.. this craft 2 of them One of them turns up on end like this. And it lights up signifying that we are here at the Cacadia Guides Yes I uh.. do feel like In connected with them I am a what they call a CE3 I've had eye to eye contact with the Grey... large Grey...
