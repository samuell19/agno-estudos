How long must we tolerate the destruction of our environment by irresponsible industry? Our government has here by its record is prepared to stand up When the interest of big business conflicts with the interests of the people. Lone shark. Our forefathers settled this land to escape the swallowed Europe with the industrial revolution. This great and beautiful land of ours is being raped. Who are you calling a bore! We pledge to preserve this wide, brown land of ours. If it continues to pollute, it will be closed. Our golden beaches will not be despoiled by With no thoughts of restoring them. Open cut mining. And who will pay for this? Industry. The same industry that three years ago who come from this country, will reinvest a large part of these profits into the country and its people. Let's get outta here! We're movin' on. You old bitch. You taught me a newie tonight, didn't ya? Oh, go on. You know 'em all. Oh, yeah, you reckon? See you on Monday. ...who was fatally shot while speaking at a Save The Environment campaign at the Domain on Sunday. Meanwhile, police fear an outbreak of bikie violence following the death on Thursday of Go Down, third member of the Grave Digger's Motorcycle Gang to be killed within a week. The unreported deaths of the bikies only came to police attention following funerals for the dead men were rival bike gangs have demonstrated their solidarity with the Grave Diggers. Police report over 400 motorcycles gathering at Gosford to escort the body of Go Down to Sydney where he will be buried with full bikie honours. ♪ Standing here on planet Earth ♪ ♪ There's just one thing I know ♪ ♪ Though you try so hard to live ♪ ♪ One day you gotta go ♪ ♪ If I'm glad for all of the pain ♪ ♪ I've had the right to choose ♪ ♪ Seems a heavy penalty ♪ ♪ To know I'm gonna lose ♪ ♪ Cosmic flash here you are ♪ ♪ Cosmic flash now there you go ♪ ♪ Cosmic flash now here you are ♪ ♪ Cosmic flash now there you go ♪ ♪ When you know, you never, never know ♪ ♪ No, you've just one chance ♪ ♪ That's the day when you get up off your knee ♪ ♪ And start to dance ♪ ♪ Yeah, I played the game of life ♪ ♪ Although the rules are rough ♪ ♪ Go ahead, think of us, remember me ♪ ♪ No, no I was too late. ♪ Okay, Go down, you got it. But believe me, whoever got you is gonna get got too, and that's a promise, right? Right. Know you're going down for the last time, mate. But don't worry because we'll be thinkin' about ya 'cause you're our mate, right? Right. Anyway, well Satan will be in there with ya, so you'll be all right. Let's get it over. Okay, Doctor. Satan! Sweet prince of darkness, here comes one of yours. His name's Go Down and he's going down to meet you and we want you to take care of him for us. Okay. There's your colours, Go Down. Now you keep your identity down there, man. Let's get him in there. Now, the reason we're burying you standing up is so as you don't have to take anything from the evil one lying down. Right? Right. What does that pack a morons think they're doing? Burying one of their mates. I can see that. Didn't you tell them it's against the law to go around burying people? Yeah, but it's been approved by the authorities. They're a religious sect, call themselves Satanists, yeah. Ah, hell. Go Down. You always wanted this of me, eh, and I never let you have it. Well, I figured I owe you now, eh? So there you go, son. Hey, I'm sorry. No! No. No, Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Please. Christ. Well, we can't wait all day. Hey, Undertaker. Here come the pigs, man. Come to pay your respects? I've got better things to do with my time. Well, go and do it. We're holding a religious service here. Unless you start telling me what you know about these killings, you might be holding a lot more religious services. Listen, Piggy. We can look after ourselves, right? You animals'll do nothing. We'll do what we fucking like. We're not going to hang around getting knocked oft one by one while you smartass bastards do your investigation routines. Anybody gets in our way, we'll kick 'em, man. We'll kick him to death. Now look here, fellas, we're only trying to get a job done. We don't wanna see any more of you blokes get killed. Now look, if you’ll only tell us anything that you know. You know, take a few minutes- Don't give us that nice guy crap. Somebody's been doing it to us and we're gonna do it to them. Right? I think you'd better keep right out of this. Look, I don't wanna hear any more. You're persecuting a minority religion. Right. So why don't you just piss off? Yeah. Okay, fellas. See you some more. Yeah, ya pigs. What's yours, love? Bottle of scotch. Gotcha. Oh, piss off. What's your problem? You look at me when I speak to you. Come on, sonny! Hey man. I thought he had you there for a minute. You blokes. You're not real good at public relations, are ya? Who need public relations? You only get arrested for indecent exposure. I wouldn't worry about a little thing like that. Let me handle the patter. What do you want? Do you sell beer here? Yeah. Well I'd like to buy some. How much do you want? A glass'll do for a start. Looking for someone? Yeah, the president of your club. Undertaker? Right. What do you want the Undertaker for? Isn't he the head man? We're all heads here. Joke, joke, joke. Now what's the deal? You pushing dope or something? No, it's about these mates of yours that have been getting killed. Why? You know something about it? No, I thought maybe you would. Why would you think that? Hey, I've seen this bloke, he's a pig. Hey, hold the phone. When I was up for pushing that last time. He gave evidence on a busted case before mine. Yeah? Yeah, that's right, I'm a cop. I've been sent to find out who's been killing your mates. Why would you wanna know that? That's the way I earn my living. Well, go and earn it off somebody else, we don't need you. Look, man, don't get heavy. Just listen to what I have to say, all right? Piss off. Look, man. You're gone, man. I didn't want any trouble. I don't want any hassle. Okay, I just wanna talk to your mate. Get those bloody lights out. What's happening, man? You're in big trouble. What's the score man? You've got a pro after you. A pro, yeah? It was a crossbow. A what? A crossbow. Three shots fired in 10 seconds and all pretty accurately. Now there's nothing left up there and there was a getaway car waiting. Give us some light. Stay there, Stinky. Thanks, man. Yeah, man, that was cool, we owe ya. Like I said, that's the way I earn a living. Well, you'd be the first pig we ever knew that did any good for anybody, man? He didn't do much for Harry the Horse and the drug bust. Yeah, but Harry the Horse never did much for anyone, either, except mess up a lot of heads. Okay, mate, what's your ploy? What do you wanna know? Well, I'm supposed to find who's knocking you blokes off and why. Well, for Christ's sake, man, I mean, you think if we knew that we wouldn't be out there kicking the shit out of them ourselves? So, what do you think you can do about it? Well, how about if I ride around with you blokes for awhile? So what's so funny about it, Undertaker? If it wasn't for him, man, the Captain would be nailed to that wall. Listen, do you wanna see the Grave Diggers riding around with a pig? So who's gonna know? He sure doesn't look like a pig. Shut up, mole. Listen, man. The whole point of us being outlaws is because we're against pigs and everything a pig represents. Now how are we gonna do our thing with a pig riding around with us? Dig, man. Like, we owe the cat a favour. Listen, man. I don't care how you carry on. Your ploy is breaking the speed limit, smoking dope... I don't know, I don't care. I'm supposed to find a killer. Okay, Diggers, what do you reckon? Midnight? I'm going with him. Septic? Yeah, man. Zonk? Nah. Death? Why not? Buzzy? 69? Ferret? Stinky? No pigs. Bad Max? Yeah. Scrag? Hooks? Give him a go, mate. Pinball? Oh, Forget it. Toad? No way. Well, I'm against you man, but it looks like I'm outvoted, so okay, you're in. But we don't wanna know any bullshit from you, man. Just ride at the back of the pack and keep ya spanners off our moles. Except by invitation only. Shut your face, Tart. He's only one cop. He gets too heavy, we kick his teeth in. Yeah, man, that's cool. All right, it's a deal. If you blokes wanna blow, I'll get the boys from ballistics over to look at the damage here. Hey, Septic, find out where he hangs out and he'll pick you up in the morning. Let's get outta here. See ya, pig. Hey, you can't go around calling him that. It'll crew our reputation. So what's your name? Stone. What? Stone. Hey, you mean like, that kind of stone? Yeah, something like that. Been for your swim? Everything working all right? How can I be sure of that? You just have to take my word for it. Ooh, a rejection, a rejection. I told you that bloke was coming around to pick me up this morning. Oh yeah, Rent-a-Bikie. Why do you always get picked for these weirdos scenes? Type casting, I guess. So you'll be living in some stinking cave with those mutants for an indefinite period, right? Something like that. Oh, well I suppose I might as well move out for a while. Oh, why don't you grow up? What do you mean? All this fearless gang busting? When's it gonna end? When all the fearless gangs have been busted, I guess. Why don't you do a centrefold for our magazine... Big boy? You mean I passed the audition? Oh, bugger it, Stone, I sick of you pissing off on all these Boy Scout adventures. I've gotta earn a living. Well, why don't you do something honest like sell used cars to old ladies? Give us a kiss. Sorry, honey, I gotta go, that's my escort. Morning. Follow me. Hey. Hey! Slow down, will ya! Hey, man. Wow, man, what a place. Yeah, well, man, when the dudes started getting knocked off, huh, we moved in here so we can protect ourselves. I mean, we got cats stationed all over the place. Come on, let's go. Hey, Blue, get up, man. We got a little generator upstairs. Give us some power. Doesn't that guy ever stop? Nah, he speeds a lot, man. I ain't never seen him sleep. Hey, Undertaker. The man's here. Hey, Stone? Hey, in here, Stone. What's you doing, man? G'day. G'day. Come in. Grab a seat. Don't look at that. How is it? What a place, what a place. Oh, yeah. Thanks. Come on. Okay, you blokes. Now look, nobody's gotta know that this cat's a pig. So just keep your head shut and we'll be all right, okay? Okay. Alright Stone, Get into those. They smell crook, man. Try it on for size, mate. They'll never know your true identity. Need to put it through the washing machine a couple of hundred times first, don't you? You do that, man, you ruin a good set of originals. Yeah, you kill their character. Anyway, the Phantom never washes his suits. I haven't seen him. Woohoo! So that's what fuzz really look like. Yum yum, pig's bum. Hey, C'mon, ya clown. Put your own on. Anyone think you're expecting a flood? Haven't you forgotten something? Uh-huh. Yeah. Now, that is a thing, huh? Yes, nice. That is a thing. Yes. Hey, Stone? Break his bloody neck. Got him Okay, Doctor. Yeah! This is gonna hurt. Put another hole in his head. I can't get it down. I'll pull it off, man. Wear 'em with pride, man. Maniacs. Hey, you want a beer, man? No, thanks. Well, you're gonna get one. What else do they do for kicks? Is that meant to be a personal question? Is that part of the deal? I just dig the taste of blood. You're in. By the sound of it, so is everybody else. Right. Just relax, love. How's Stone? They sent him off to chaperone some awful bike gang. How uncool. He'll probably reform them and recruit them all as telegram boys for the PMG. Like to screw it on, do ya? My foot slipped. Oh, yeah? Wanna drag, do it our way. Drag, folks! Hey, Midnight. Come on. Midnight here can blow there rest of us off pretty easy, so if you can get anywhere near him, man, you're doing okay. Now you've been around the circuit here. Yeah. Yeah, well you know your way. Right, once around the circuit. Back to here wins. Fire up your engines. You dropped it like as bag of spuds, Stone. How are ya, Stone? You got some guts, son. Now, anybody tries to knock you blokes off, give 'em enough time, you'll do it yourselves. Who'd wanna kill a lovely bunch of guys like us, eh? Everybody wants to kill those mad men. I know plenty of people that really enjoy seeing all those outlaws bulldoze into a mass grave, bikes and all. What sort of people? Ordinary bike riders that get the rough treatment. You know. Go on. Well, blokes who own garages. Guys who own pubs and run milk bars, hamburger joints. Like would you believe just about everyone? You? Oh, no, no. They don't give me no grief. Besides, they've got a bit of class, the old outlaws. Keep their bikes going well, and they know what hard riding's all about. But, I always managed to keep a bit ahead of them. Oh, wow. I bet that really moves past the competition, eh? Baby, it makes mincemeat out of them. Well, I don't know who'd actually want to kill 'em, you know. Well rough 'em up, maybe. They do you any harm? Oh, yes and no. Well they knock stuff off. Sauce bottles, knives and forks, stuff like that. And they turn up the jukebox hell of a loud with pliers and screw up the works. And they park their bikes everywhere. I suppose they scare away a lot of potential customers, eh? No, that's the funny thing. This is kind of their joint, you know? People actually come here to see them. What sort of people? Snotty looking guys in big cars with they're snotty looking girlfriends. Anything else? Yeah. A lot of birds by themselves, you know. Go on. I've seen the Grave Diggers soon sort them out. They're pretty strange chicks, I tell ya. They didn't do much sitting down after a couple of weeks after the Grave Diggers have done it to 'em. Any outraged boyfriends? Yeah, well these birds are their own people. Like they head Grave Diggers chick. Oh yeah, Vanessa. You know, she was a big model. Made a lot of dough, really big time. Now who'd think a chick like that would wanna be an outlaw mole? I mean, she was famous, had her face up everywhere, and then she met the Undertaker, and good night. Wow, man. Like I really love the Grave Diggers. They are far out. You know they're really, they're too cool. How come you love 'em? Because they did me a big favour, man, a big fat, beautiful favour. They came in here one night with the Orgasm. They're a group, they're good too. Some of 'em had laid some really good acid on the Diggers, so the Diggers used to travel with them and it was collection night. How's that? Don't lay that hard cuttin' jive on me, man. You're a fuzz, the protection bit. Anyway, the Diggers were hanging in here grooving and in come the heavies, the protection collectors, you dig? Well, they hung out in the crowd in their jivey looking clothes and hats and things. And the Diggers started putting them on, you know, seeing them up gutless, sort of feeling their gear. The next thing, they got nasty and it was on. Wow, what a freaky scene, man. Those racket guys are mean. But the beautiful Diggers kicked 'em almost to death and in time to the music as well. The way they danced out the side of those hoods heads, Fred Astaire would have lost his mind. Anyway, the Diggers soft shoed them right out the freaking door. All the heavies, they really didn't groove on it at all, but the Diggers loved it so much so that they made this their place and the collection men haven't been back since. This has gotta be the only night-time groover in town that doesn't have to pay protection, unless of course you count a few caps from time to time for the Diggers, but that kind of protection we can handle, you dig? Yeah. All right, okay, so you think the Grave Diggers are good news, right? But what about the protection men? What do they think? Who cares, man, but the Grave Diggers, they're beautiful studs. They are just beautiful. There's a cop on the phone for you, Amanda. Inspector Hannigan? Amanda St. Vincent speaking. Yes, yes, that's right. What have you done with him? Well, yes, I know that but... Well, I haven't seen him for... No. No, but dear Inspector Hannigan, doesn't he get any time off? Why for me? Yes. I miss my policeman a little bit. Well, couldn't you relieve him with someone? Oh, really, Inspector. Surely anyone can look after pack a bike hoodlums. Or did you pick him because he has a university degree? Yes, I know he's a good policeman, but he's a good tennis player too and we're one short here. Well, you can't keep him on duty for 24 hours a day. Oh, maybe I should run that article on police brutality. Indeed, Inspector. But you must understand, Inspector. Doesn't your girlfriend get lonely when you have to work long hours? Yes, I know you're married. Bye, inspector. Thank you. What will it be? Gin and tonic and a Bacardi and coke, thanks. Give us a cigarette. Umm. Ah, yes. Give us a... kiss. What? I said give us a kiss. Hey, fellas. Yeah? He won't give me a kiss. Ohhhh. Poor old Toad, eh, they won't give him a kiss. Here, Toad. I'll give you a kiss. Who are you staring at? Wasn't staring at anyone. Fancy me, do you? Not really. Why not? What's wrong? You're staring at me again. Toad? Yeah? You want a drink? No. I've got a couple. Bye. Oi! Thanks for the cigarette, gentlemen. One for you, Doc. One for you, my darling. One for you, Stinkfinger. One for me. One for you Doc, and another one for you, sweetie. One for you, Stinky. One for me, one for you Doc. My darling, one for you. Stinkfinger, me, Doctor Death and my little beauty, one for you. Stink, me, Doc, my sweetie. Avery, uh, special one for you, my darling. Stinky. Show your cards. Hey, man, it's the Black Hawks. Well, if it isn't our old mates, the Gravies. Bird Man and his Dodos. Doesn't seem to be too many of your own lately. Been living up to your names, eh? Who's riding this? I am. Hey man, where'd you get that? He made me an offer I couldn't refuse. Jap crap. It fell over. Cool it! Cool it, man. Take it easy. You wanna get heavy? Take it easy. Come on, you wanna get heavy? Come on, piss off. We're going. Get outta here! So, there it is. Prime real estate at a reasonable price. But the most attractive aspect is if we control this land we control the whole surrounding area. We've had a bit of luck. The Grave Diggers were involved in a fight with another bikie gang and firearms were used. It seems to me to be a perfect opportunity to, uh, set them up for a major hit. Transfer the blame to the Black Hawks. Good way to put all our eggs in the one basket. Grab a chair, man Sorry. Man, we better check the west, right. Come on. Ferret. I can't believe your bike. Yeah? Really goes, doesn't it? And you screw it on in second. Wow, the vibrations. Slut. Rip him, rip him. No, Undertaker. I told you to keep your spanners off our moles. You think we're a pack of imbeciles, don't you? Yeah, right. Listen, what Tart did was against our laws and when you break the law, you get punished, right? If she doesn't want to be Toad's woman, all she has to do is tell him and it's finished. Oh yeah. Well that's a good law. All based on violence. All law is based on violence, man. And any cat that breaks the law gets clobbered. Only difference is our law only applies to us. Your law, sends young blokes to somebody else's country, to fight people you know nothin' about. As long as you keep on shooting them, they hang metals on you. When you don't shoot them anymore they shut you in jail. And now somebody's knocking off our mates and you tell us we're not supposed to do anything about it. That's bullshit man. Shit, it's my watch. I'll come with you. I wanna see Toad. How'd y'all get together? It's peculiar. But when you've been conditioned into believing something and you blow it, I mean, you really blow it, you get this incredible sense of shame. And it's funny because you can almost recognise fellow travellers. And when you ride bikes, man. I mean when you really ride bikes, I suppose it's inevitable. No, thanks man. I thought you were meant to be on the drug squad or something. Yeah, well they don't encourage field research. Are you into dope? I'm into a natural thing at the moment. And bikes, of course. Right. Hey, well man, when I was cranked over on that last corner and you were coming around the outside of me, I really thought you was going to take me. I had to lean so far over that back wheel started to come up. And of course it did. Hey, Midnight, where'd you learn to ride like that? Up in Coonabarabran. Used to round up the stock in the old BMWs. I never rode in the tar before I come to the city though. Do you miss the bush? No bloody way. Live in a humpy on Gunnedah Hill. Work for nothing. Hang around the main street on Saturday night. Stick that up your ass. Hey, I remembered who you were. You fought that world rated at heavyweight right in the States, right? Right. You were in hospital for a week. I wasn't ready. That hungry manager of mine was off to some quick bread. When I came out, he was gone. Undertaker was then in the army nick. When they let him out, we just got on our bikes and rode. Everyone just came together. They found us or we found them. Now we've got a good thing going. Yeah, that's what bikes do for ya. Right, that's right, mate. When you're on a bike, I mean a big bike, you've got all power. That big iron thing, man. It's all fins and rods and edges and noise. It's power and you're part of it. Strong like it is. Yeah, it's the greatest feeling in the world. Yeah, once you've really ridden a big bike fast and hard, who wants to do anything else? That's right, understand, right! Right, it's a good thing. Yep. Well that's we're here man, together. Because when we're out there riding with the Grave Diggers, right, Christ, we own the world. What can stop us, man, what can stop us? Hey. Sun's up. Who's for a swim? You gotta be kiddin'. No, it's the best time of day. Best time for the sharks, man. Well, we won't tell them we're coming. Who's idea was this then? Give us one of them yarnies there, man. Stick it in there and make this bludger burn. What a beautiful way to go to work. Yeah, with your head stuck in a newspaper. They catch the fastest boat they can so they don't have to look at the view. Suppose if you went fast with every day of your life, you'd get bored too. That's why you gotta keep moving. Who wants some beer at the pub? You've got beer here. Feel like getting out. But this is a fortress, man. And you're safe here. Who needs it? Oh yeah, I nearly forgot. Some joker come in this morning. Left this for ya. Said you'd be interested to get it back. Anything wrong? Yeah, man. That's Go Down's helmet. Right. Someone's been missing with his grave. Who brought this in here? I don't know. Never seen him before. He just said to tell ya it was the compliments of the Black Hawks. Ah yeah. Intrepid bird man, eh? Bloody clowns. We better get over there. You moles wait here. Stick with them them will you, mate, this is our business. Come on, fellas. Hey, hang on. Hey, Undertaker, you gotta be kidding man. I mean, this is, this is a setup. It's a hit. That wasn't left there by the Black Hawks. Yeah? Surprise, surprise, man. Look, man. You'll walk into a bullet. We'll make out. Okay, buddy. Listen, this is police business. Will you come off it. You're wrong, Stone. This is our person. I need change for your phone. Drop your guns! Get down. Cool it. Get up! Get their guns. Come. Over there. Round the back. That's him. That's the man. Okay Toad, I got him. Come on, let him go. Hey man, how are ya? You okay? I got him, Undertaker, I got him. Course you did, man. Hey, who is he? The lead. The guy from the demo. The demo we was at, he shot the other cat, right? Dr. Townes. Right, the politician cat. He shot him. I saw him do it. Why didn't you tell us, mate? I was tripping so hard, see? I was on rad. I was off my head, right? I did some figuring, thinking it was my fault and you'll give me a kickin' and kiss me off. And I got scared. Oh, fuck. Oh, I'm gonna die. Bullshit, Toad. Two small holes like this, no way. Right. I can tell, I think. How your guts? My guts is in a knot, son. Oh well, we can fix the old saddlebags up for ya. You can have 'em out the back while you're riding. Yeah. You'll be able to crap in a plastic bag. I'm not scared, 'cause it doesn't hurt, right? Oh, I'm sorry, mate. Forget it. Still together, right? Right. Where's our Doctor Death, then? He finally made it, man. I'll be there too soon, hey? Doesn't feel bad. It feels quite good really. What a fucking trip it's been, eh? Cool it, Undertaker. Get back, son, he's ours. Keep still all of ya. This is what my job's all about, right? I'll kill ya. Look, man, this cat is wanted internationally. Man, this cunt has killed six of our mates! If you put him in, he'll get 15 years and he'll be back out on the streets in 10. I gotta protect him, man. Bullshit. I will kill you! You really are a pig, aren't ya? All right, you can fucking have him. You can have the lot of 'em. We'll be back. Come on, let's go. That bloody fool. He'll have every cop in the state looking for him. Why? What have they done? Well, there has to be an inquiry to be charged with illegal possession of firearms, starting firearms in a public place. Christ knows what else. That's if they’re caught, and they will be. Will they go to jail? It's hard to say. And you better get rid of that before Inspector Hannigan sees it. I don't think so. I can't understand why you like them. Well. They got something going for 'em. They've got a sort of a sense of honour that I like. They just up and do the sort of things that people would like to be able to do. Yeah. I like the old Grave Diggers. I'd be glad to see 'em any time. Get out of here! Inspector Hennigan. No cops. No cops. No.
