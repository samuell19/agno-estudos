Alex? Oh, hey. What are you doing here? I let myself in. You don't live here anymore. I know, but you told me to get my things from the house, so that's what I'm doing. That was six months ago when we broke up. You don't have anything else here, I checked. You know, I thought about the same thing and then I remembered... Christmas. Okay. Since... Since when do you even like Christmas? You know, it's not me. I don't. It's Bianca. She's my fianc√©e. Yeah, I know you're engaged, Alex. Ah, she loves, loves Christmas. Oh, ooh, yay. - Yeah, she does. - Fun days... Oh, good. - Yeah, she does. - Great. Yeah. You know what she did? - Hmm? - She got us a vacay during the holidays. - No! - Yeah. Wow. - Can you believe it? - No. She completes me so much. - Oh... - Yeah, she completes me. - Oh! - Oh, my goodness. Great, take whatever you need, take everything. - You know what? - Hmm? I think, uh, I think that's it. Good, okay, great. Get out. Merry Christmas. I just... - Happy holidays. - Gotta get ready. - You know, so out you go. - That's... Yeah. - And you know what, actually, hey. - Hmm? I want to say thank you for being everything - that you've been. - No, that is mine. - Okay. - I think that's... Just so understanding of our situation, you know. - Uh-huh... - I know when couples tend to break up, especially on the terms that we did, they're usually at each other's necks, like, you know... Yeah. Oh, yeah, no. Especially when your boyfriend of five years breaks up with you to find himself and then gets engaged six months later. - Yes. - A lot. Yeah. See, exactly. - Yeah. - And that's why you're cool. Yeah, right, I'm a super cool ex-girlfriend. I guess I'd have to be, you know, 'cause I just wanna, ahhh, kill you, 'cause, you know, you got engaged on our anniversary. - Yeah, but you're the best. - Hmm... - Out, out. Okay, bye! Bye! - Okay. Bye. Yeah, thank you. Alex, put that back. Okay, thank you. Back. I'm going back to bed. Hello, answer the phone, sis. I know you're up, Terri. I know you're up, answer the phone. Terri, sis, come on. I don't want to talk. Not now, not ever. What time is it? Oh, my... Sis, you and Alex were not meant to be. I mean, come on, he ordered cooked fish at a sushi restaurant. Shauna, please, just let me lay here and wither. I just want to wither. Terri, you're beautiful, supermodel gorgeous, pre-Botox, impeccable skin, with a heart like Mother Teresa. You can do this. Get up, get out of the house. We have a business to save. I can't do this without you. I don't want to run a business. I don't want to leave the house. I just want to go live in a monastery. I think you mean convent. Whatever. Oh, that Trinity School education is really kicking in. Daddy would be so proud. I miss Daddy. I wish he was here. Daddy's always here with us, sis. He's always looking down. And if he was here, what would he say? He would say I was his sunshine. And not to cry because joy cometh in the morning. Amen, sis. How are you? Well, not good. We're not good. We have not had a new client in six months. Not sold anything in months. I'm terrified we're going to lose everything. We need our star back. I wish I could be there for you. I want... I want to... I just... I need you, Terri. I need your help. Dad left this business to the both of us, not just me. Plus, you're the best real estate agent ever. You could sell ice to an Eskimo. No! It's true. And I need you to use all those skills like right now. T, you remember Claudia? The girl in our hot yoga class? I did not, no. Well, she just gave me the juiciest tidbit of information. Get this. George Camden. George Camden, Black billionaire hedge fund dude? Yep. It seems like George caught his lovely wife doing the backstroke with the pool boy. It was a huge scandal and created a big wave in the financial industry. This is not Page Six. What does this have to do with me? Well, he owns a magnificent penthouse on Park Ave. And he'd like to dump it, quick, before the divorce. He doesn't know it yet, but he needs the service of Manhattan's best real estate broker before the judge offloads it to his wife and Mr. Phelps. Okay, so what do we do? How do we get him? Well, that's where I need you. I need your ice selling skills and your perfect form doing the downward dog. Yoga? Yes, sis. He attends Claudia's class on East 39th faithfully every Tuesday for the past eight years. He's not going to talk to me. What did Dad say? Make opportunities. Exactly. So whatever you have to do, we need that commission. How am I supposed to do that? How am I supposed to get him? Heh. Again, I thought you'd never ask. I traded my hair appointment with Bronte, the diamond district diva, who was literally booked a year out with Claudia. In advance, she accidentally double booked you and our billionaire boy wonder in one private session together. The depths of your deception never cease to amaze me. Bronte's had eyes for my trainer Jacques for two years. A blind date is currency exchange in these times. I'm a business woman. I really, I don't care and I don't want to know. Tuesday, 8:00 a.m. And whatever it is, it better be tight. Come on! Bye, love you. Bye. Man, can't even work out. Yes, Vivian. I'm in yoga, same as every week. Why, why do you ask? Okay, I don't have time for this right now. Shake it off, shake it off. Having a stroke? Heh! I'm not really sure what you're trying to do there. Ahh... No, no, I'm just... Just a little stressed. And besides, it seems like my yoga instructor isn't here yet, so yeah. Well, then I guess I'm just on time. Yeah, you are. You want me to help or...? By all means, you can help, yeah. - You know what, so if you, um... - Whoa. - I was gonna show you warrior pose. - Okay. Um, if you just put your leg out in front... It's very good for stress relief. If you just push down on your shoulders. - Okay. - Yeah, oh, okay. - Need a little challenge. - Yeah, yeah. Um... Oh, if you've got that, then you come up to your front leg and pick up the back one. - All right. - Yeah. - Ooh. - Tip forward... Oh. Okay, you're a pro. - Ooh. Whoa. No, not a pro... - Excuse me. But you'd at least think I'd be halfway decent with all the money I've spent on these private lessons. Ah. Yeah. Do you know where Claudia is? - She's usually never late. - No, I... Oh, my gosh! - It's my first day. - Are you okay? You all right? - Um, yeah. - Whoa. All right. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I am sorry about that. - No problem. For being in your space. Yeah. Yeah, the... Um, it's all right, yeah. - It's your space. - A lot better than... the assistant she had before, that's for sure. Oh. No, I'm... I'm not the assistant. Sorry. Sorry I'm late. - Hey, there she is. - I'm never... never, never late. Yeah, she's never late. Never. George, I'm so sorry. Let me set my things down and I'll be right with you. Again, I'm so sorry, this never happens. No, no problem, it's fine. See, your assistant's been very helpful and kind. I'll say. Georgie! Georgie! Vivian, what are you doing here? Stopping you from making the biggest mistake of your life. Ladies, I'm so sorry. Sorry. Look, you're too late, all right? It's over. - Oh, no, not that. - What? You've reduced the spending limit on my credit card. - It's Christmas, for crying out loud. - Are you kidding me? I'm not gonna have these talks with you, all right? You cheated on me, remember? It always has to go back to that. Can we stop living in the past? That was weeks ago. I have nothing more to say to you. If you don't like the way the proceedings are going, then have your lawyers talk to my lawyers. Heh, well, funny you say that. Surprise. You've got some nerve to hand somebody... Are you insane? Why does everyone keep saying that about me? - Maybe you are. - Yeah. Heh. Is this a conversation you two wanna have in private? - Mm-hmm. - We're fine, thank you though. Look, you're the one that filed the injunction on me to have me to stop from moving my money. It's our money. No, no, no, no, this is my money. I just... Keep it. See, that's your problem. You've lost touch with reality. This is real life, not an episode of Good Times. How do you expect someone to live off of $12,000 a day? - Are you kidding me? - It's Christmas! - Get out of here. - Fix it. Yo. We need the entire team. We're going to go full war room. I need the entire team. Yeah... No, this is priority. I need a plan to end this once and for all. Yeah, I need it done within 48 hours. No, Vivian's gone way too far this time. All right. Thank you. Ladies... Look, I'm sorry, okay? This is very stressful and I really don't wanna be stressed. Is it possible I could have both of you there, yes? We'll be there. Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks again, I'm sorry. And thank you as well, and Merry Christmas to you both. - Merry Christmas. - I... What was that? Heh. It's complicated. What's complicated? In my defense, he's a billionaire and you don't say no to a billionaire, especially with the rent prices of this place. Okay, what? Heh. What's going on? You helped him, I guess? Oh. Okay. And he thinks you're my assistant. - I'm not your assistant. - Okay, but I need you to be. George Camden is assembling a war room to bring down his wife. He's talking lawyers, a PR team, a tech department, health and wellness. Health and wellness? Okay. That'll be us. And he only wants me there because he wants you there. So I really need you there. What... Me? Where? And I need this job, so you need to learn yoga. I hate yoga. Oh, my God, I'm gonna kill Shauna. No, I can't do it, I... You should've seen her. She's like... Jessica Rabbit came to life and walked into the yoga studio. Well, you better double up on your air squats, bat your little eyes, and tap dance like Sammy Davis Jr. On the Vegas strip. Whatever it takes, we need this listing. We have minus $14.07 in our bank account. The bum on the side of the street that I just passed has more than us. And he's at zero. Let's go. Uh-uh. No, I can't, I can't do it. Terri, please. You have to. I don't think we're going to make it. I've literally done everything I can. I've called everyone that I know. He thinks I am a yoga instructor. This is better than we can ever imagine, sis. How is this a good scenario? He's got an emergency meeting at the Deer Lodge Resort to finalize his divorce proceedings. He's literally going to divide his kingdom. We need somebody on the inside and you're it. You'll have untethered access to his most vulnerable moments. Untethered access as a yoga instructor, not as a real estate agent. We'll figure that part out. Right now, you need to pack. Oh, my God, you are so the evil sister. I'll do an evil laugh, but this is serious. This can really work. No. No. I should have walked in and given him my business card. Hello, how are you? Here's the card. That's it. Why did I have to be helpful? Which makes you the good sister. So go be the good sister that you are and save our jobs and apartments and everyone that works for us. That, that was spot on, that was a good one. Seriously, sis, we need this. No. Shauna, there are too many things that could go wrong. I'm sorry, there will be other listings. Not like this one. This one listing puts us back on top, covers all of our bills, all of our debt, and can even give some loyal employees a Christmas bonus. You know, that's the other thing... it's Christmas. Who hauls their staff away this close to Christmas? I mean, who is this guy, Ebenezer Scrooge? Well, show up as the Ghost of Christmas Real Estate, but get that listing. George Camden thinks I am a yoga instructor. How many yoga instructors do you know that land multi-million dollar listings, Shauna? I told you, we'll figure that part out. This is a stupid idea, no. What is that? What are you showing me? That's our debt. You see what I just sent you? Is...? Is that...? Our business account. And that's a negative sign. Uh-huh... Okay. I'll go pack. I'm packing. I'll go pack. I'm going. I'm doing this, I'm going, I'm packing. Just going to be a yoga instructor. Wow. Hello! Welcome to the Deer Lodge Resort. Don't be alarmed, your TV is on a motion sensor. Be excited about all the amazing things you can do during your stay here. Hi, I'm Marvin, and this is the Deer Lodge Resort, Santa's home away from home. He and Mrs. Santa come for the skiing, but they stay for the magical environment. This is our most romantic time of the year. We're completely booked up because of all the love in the air. So whether you are looking to sit by the fire - and sip some hot chocolate with that special someone... - No. No. - or if you'd like to take a long romantic walk... - No. Not gonna... we've got what you're looking for. Perhaps you'd like to get a couples massage or rev up the romance and hit the slopes. We've got what you're looking... We'll let you know exactly what we can do to help you... Or maybe I'm not interested in any of that, Marvin, because love doesn't exist, okay? And all I do is lie to everyone anyway. Did you ever think about that, Marvin, hmm? Yep. Coming. I'm coming. Hi! You must be Terri McKenzie. Yes. How did you know that? We know all sorts of things. That's not creepy. Heh. Right? Most importantly, you're here for the George Camden retreat. - Yes. - I'm Marvin. I'm the head bellhop here at the Deer Lodge Resort. I just wanted to personally welcome you. - Again. - I'm sorry? - Hmm? - Hmm? No, nothing. Um... I think you were saying something? I was saying that I hope that you're finding everything to your liking. Now, how are you enjoying your stay so far? This is a magical place. - So I've heard. Heh. - You heard right! Gosh, you're just like a little human espresso machine, aren't you? And you're here at the most romantic place on earth alone. - Right? - Uh... There's only two people that are single - staying at the entire resort. - This is a work trip. It's business. Speaking of which, I have something for you. Here are your accommodations for this weekend's activities. Thank you. "Yoga instructor." Yoga instructor. See, that's, that's me. Nice to meet you. Now, is there anything I can do for you? Yes, yes. It is a little bit cold in here and, actually, they made me leave all of my luggage at the car. Thermostat. Your things will be up here shortly. Now, if there's anything that we can do to accommodate you, my staff will stop at nothing, so do not hesitate to call. I will not dare. Heh. Hesitate. I will call. I... Will do, thank you. Oh. I had to leave my purse in the rental... everything is... Of course they did. Well, you have yourself a nice day now. Yoga. A meet and greet today at... I... Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. I'm late. To my very first meeting. Oh, God. Shauna's going to kill me. Okay. I can do it. Okay, I can do it. No, I... need a second. 'Cause I'm late. It's probably... It's probably too late. Okay... I am a yoga instructor. I do yoga. Namaste. Namaste. Okay. No. Yes... No. I'm going. I can't do this. This is such a crazy idea. Okay, okay. Okay, I'm just... Go, why would I be...? No. Excuse me, hello. Oh, are you okay? You're the yoga assistant, correct? Yeah, just, um, practicing my Zen poses. I see. Well, come on up, come on in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, uh-huh. Namaste. Heh. Namaste. Hey. - Hey. Yeah. - Come on up. Good... Whoa, whoa. Nice to meet you. - Or see you again, I should say. - Yeah... - see you again. - Heh. Yeah. - This way? - This way. Well, I really do appreciate you stopping by. The actual war room doesn't start till tomorrow though. Oh, but the itinerary said that there was a meet and greet. That's just an excuse to get people here a day early so they can settle in. My staff and crew work pretty hard for me, as you probably know, and sometimes on a whim. Like to give them a chance to settle in with their family and loved ones, take a view of the entire place. But no one seemed to come to the meet and greet. It's not because I'm an Ebenezer Scrooge. - Oh, heh, wow. - Oh, God. I was, um... You know what, I'm going to get out of your hair. I've definitely embarrassed myself enough for today. Well, I'll definitely remember to... And you're, uh...? You're, uh...? Are you sure that I, um... - Your... - Oh! I'm Terri actually, not that you would know from that. Heh. Yeah, I'll make sure we get you another one of these. At least I know the next time I have a meet and greet, one person will show up. And by all means, bring your boyfriend. I'll set out wine, crackers, and cheese, and you guys can have the whole run of the place. - No boyfriend, just me. - Oh, really? - Mmm. - I don't find too many people that come up here alone. This place is magical. Yeah, I've heard a lot about the magic and... I'm sorry, I'm gonna see you tomorrow. Okay, all right. Hey, and, um, I'll be here. But one question, if you didn't mind. - Yeah. - Do you ski? I'm Black. - So there's that. - There you go. Well, the fact is that you're here alone, and, technically, you still have more time with the meet and greet, so would you like to learn? You're a very hard man to say no to. Well, that sounds like a plan. - Let's do it. - Let's do it. - Jinx. Heh. - Yeah. Heh. Right this way. Be careful of the stairs. Hmm. Okay, so they just close ski lifts to civilians? Private lessons. Should we go around again, or...? Uh, we can, or we can, uh... Or we can just sit here and talk. That okay with you? Yeah. All right. So what's on your mind? If you had told me last week that I would be at a ski resort with George Camden, I wouldn't have believed you in a billion years. Well, if you would've told me that I would've have been fighting to keep my finances from my cheating ex-wife so close to Christmas, I would have said that, uh... Ah, I guess that wasn't, that isn't too hard to believe, after all. Yeah... So why here? And not at one of your skyrises or an exotic beach somewhere? Well, I think you've seen Vivian. She's a disruptor. She cheated on me and there's already 12 articles in the newspaper. She's going to contest the prenup, then she's going to contest half, and then she's going to protest getting it all. Is that even possible? Yeah, well, I'm not going to wait to find out. - I have to move now, so... - Hey, everything is... No, really, everything is going to work out. - Here, look at me. - We'll see. Hmm? Um, you should close your eyes and take a few deep breaths from here. Good, good. - That felt great. - Feel better? Yeah, I do, thank you. So, why fight with her? You don't really seem like the type that cares about money. Hmm. I'm a billionaire, Terri. When people look at me, they see money. What do you see? Just a kid from Queens. I did people's math homework to keep 'em from beating me up, that's all. I don't know how to date supermodels or live this public relationship life I've been thrusted into. Then what is this all about? Well... She manipulated me. I'm never going to let anyone use me like that again. She didn't love me. And this may sound silly, but, uh... fighting for true love, whoever that is, she at least deserves that. My future kids deserve that. You can make more money and buy more penthouses. Yeah. I bought that penthouse to raise a family. It's the same building my mother used to clean. You know, I used to have conversations with... her wanting to provide such opportunities for her kids. I just wish she could see how well her son was doing now, you know? If Vivian gets that penthouse, all she's going to do is rent it out for Instagram photo shoots. I'd rather give it to a deserving family than have it rack up emojis and likes on IG. That's... No. Wow. What? You're romantic. You are. - Stop it. - Hmm. I'm also a terrible skier, so I hope you are ready. Heh. You invited me! - Hey, it's... - Are you being serious? I'm very serious. - You're joking. - No. - I don't know what I'm doing. - I don't either. We'll learn together. - Oh, no. - Yes. How do you get off of this thing? - All right, it's time. - Okay. - Stand up, right? - You don't even know. I'm telling you, I at least know this part. - You stand up... - Okay, stand up. Then you lean forward and just go. Bye. - Ah, yeah, all right. - This is beautiful. I like it, this is nice. It's beautiful. So what time is this lesson? Well, we are a bit early, so, uh... This is the place he told us to meet, so I'm pretty sure he'll be here soon. Heh. What? Oh, no, it's just funny. The three times we've bumped into each other, I was either on time, late, and now we're early. Maybe it's fate. Yo! Hey, hey. Hey! - Hey, there he is. - Is...? That's the ski instructor, the bellhop guy? You know, your guess is as good as mine. I don't know. Oh... He doesn't seem like he knows what he's doing. I... No. Oh... I'm okay! I think we're in trouble. I'm alive! Looking good. Look, we can just back out. That's a big hill. Um, again, Black. Not gonna be mad about skipping that. Let's go. - Yeah? - Yeah, come on. Oh, thank you. All right. Hey, dude! You guys here for the beginner lessons? I thought you said this was a private lesson. No, it is a private lesson. It's a maximum of two couples. Just because I don't like crowds doesn't mean I don't like people. Hey, we were just leaving. We were just about to leave. No, heh, you can't leave. You can't fully appreciate Deer Lodge without experiencing the slopes. This is Santa Claus' favorite mountain. Rumor has it he learned to ski in this very spot. Only way back to the ski lodge, down that hill. - Oh, boy. - You guys should stay. You're such a cute couple. - Oh, thank you. - Not as cute as us, baby. I love you so much. - Maybe we should just stay. - I love you, sweetheart. - We're already here. - Oh, I love you. Oh, come on. Come on. Oh, gosh. I'm Alex and this is Bianca. Oh, I'm Bianca Harris, but soon to be Mrs. Bianca Wright. Oh, yeah, under the glove, I see, right on. I'm George Camden, nice to meet you. This is... You're George Camden? Uh, yeah. Heh. Is...? Is that Vivian Camden? - Oh, my God. Vivian? - No. - Dude, are you famous? - No. Well, if it's not football or a Will Smith movie, then I'm lost, bro, you know what I'm saying. Are you guys trying to work it out? Oh, my God, that is so cute. No, that's not... - It's so cute. - Uh, no. They think that you... - Yeah. Totally, yeah. - Vivian, I am such a huge fan. Viv... Oh, my God. Oh, hey, hey. Oh, wait, whoa... Hey, whoa! Wait! Wait! Oh, my gosh. I thought we were going together, come on. Wait! Hold on... Just wait. Wait, I haven't gone through the waiver yet. I have an entire speech prepared on the history of this slope. I hope this won't reflect negatively on the customer satisfaction survey. Don't panic. Nobody panic. Everything's fine. Come back! You're not even supposed to be down there yet! Okay, okay. No, no. Tree. Oh, slow. You're supposed to... Agh! Slow! Whoa. You all right? You okay? Heh. Let's do that again. Give me five minutes, I'm gonna head... Catches up with ya. - Ah. Ah. - Yes. Well, so much for Black girls that can't ski, right? - That was amazing! - That was. - I'm a professional. - Yes. The smallest hill on the entire slope, but it was still cool. And you can never say that again. - Yeah! - And that would be just... fine. - No... - I feel like I did it. - We're good, we did it. - I'm done. All right. Let's get out of here. - Okay. - Let's go home. Oh, baby, I love you. I love you too. Don't let me fall. I won't, not like that. Oh, be there, baby. - Yes! - Namaste! Namaste. I don't even know why we're laughing. I could have died. You couldn't have. You don't have to walk me back to my cabin, you know. Well, for the next 48 hours, you're on payroll. From what I've seen, you are definitely an insurance risk. Ha-ha. Okay, I don't think you're getting like the full picture of who I really am. - Really? - Mmm. Well, from what I've seen thus far, you are amazing. Don't think I've ever met a yoga instructor quite like you. Ah, yes. Well, I am an amazing yoga instructor. Right this way, Miss Amazing Yoga Instructor. This door. Oh, wow. Whew, it is freezing in here. Goodness gracious. You sure like it cold, huh? Definitely do not. I think it's broken. - Oh. - Oh, my goodness. What a day this is turning out to be. Hey, I'll tell you what, I can call the front desk, see if they can get you another room. Well, the bellhop slash ski instructor guy said they're totally sold out. In fact, there are only two single people staying in the whole resort. Oh... Well, um, there's got to be some way that I can help. There's gotta be somewhere else you could stay. Or maybe that works? That was the way I can help. - Yeah? - Yeah. Oh, please, I wouldn't know what to do with that. I'll figure it out. Ah, let's see. Um... Well, I have good news and I have bad news. Oh, all right. Ah. So what's the good news? The heat will be back on in two hours. - Oh, that's what I'm talking about. - Yes. Bad news? - My luggage. - No! Somehow between the car and the cabin, they lost it. - They don't know where it is. - Are you kidding me? - How is that even possible? - Have you met me? George, that's like probable. - After you, by all means. - Oh. - Yeah, ladies first, right? - Yeah. No, it's fine. I'm gonna call my sister, have her wire me some cash. You know, I'm sure the souvenir shop has - like the coolest mom jeans. - Right. Oh, I've heard the Deer Lodge sweatshirt's like to die for, so... Well, you know, if I had my laptop, I'd go to their website and check right now. Yeah, I think it's a sign. I need a new wardrobe... I've been a bit of a sweatpants and fluffy slippers kind of girl. - I get it, I get it, yeah. - Yeah. What? Mmm. It's nothing. - What are you laughing at? - It's you. - Me... You're laughing at me? - No. I've never seen someone roll with the punches as well as you do. How do you do it? Oh. I think I've just had a lot of practice. Oh. Thank you, I really appreciate you starting the fire for me. I'm sure you have like a thousand things to do. - Oh, no. - I'll be fine. You know what, actually, that is very kind of you. Do you mind? Just a quick check. Is that all right? Thank you for that. Ooh. Wasn't expecting that many calls. Anything important? Uh... no. Nothing my lawyers can't handle. Ah, you know... Yeah, I could tell you're kicking me out, it's all right. I'll see you tomorrow morning. - Oh. - It's all right. You could at least finish your cocoa. I mean, it's kind of the perfect setting. Well, I can't say I don't agree. - It is a cocoa moment. - Mmm. I mean, this moment could be on the box. - Yeah. - Yeah. It really could. Yeah. I'd buy anything you were selling. I'll be right back. Oh, well, you'll be back? Yeah. Oh... Why am I just now hearing from you? Things must be going well. A little too well. I don't think we should do this. Is he not putting the penthouse on the market anymore? He's definitely putting the penthouse on the market. So what's the problem? He thinks I'm a yoga instructor. Just tell him that your sister, me, the one who is doing everything in her power to keep this business afloat, is in real estate. You're already in good with him. Just make the referral and I'll close the deal. Easy. It's not that easy. I... I just, like a small itty, itty-bitty... I think I like him. You said love was for suckers. Never said anything about a budding connection. We need this. I can't. I can't. He's been hurt and used before and I just, I don't want to do it like this. I feel bad and excited for you all at the same time. But right now, being broke trumps all of that. We need this. You know I wouldn't ask you if we didn't really need it. Fine. Fine. Call you when it's finished. Love you. Ah. Sorry, my sister's a bit of a chatty Cathy. No, it's-it's fine. I should really get going. I did finish the cocoa, so you know. Oh. Yeah. But what happens if the fire goes out before the heat comes back on? You know, I could throw some more logs on the fire if you'd like, yeah, by all means. - Could you? - Sure. - Thank you. - Yeah. I mean, the heat could come back on any minute. - It could... come back on. - So maybe you should stay. Yeah, I could stay a little longer if you like. Yeah, it could be any minute. - Okay. - Yeah. So it's settled. You want... - What do you...? - My place? Do you have heat? Oh, do I. The best. - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, I... - I'm just going to change. - Okay, that's fine, totally. I'll change too, when I get back over - to my spot. - Yeah. You know what I mean? All right, I'll see you in a minute. - I'll be back! - Okay. There. Everything in life... Oh, my gosh. Comes smooth and easy. That boy good! Has anybody ever told you that you are a sore winner? Just joking. That was humble. What are you talking about? Oh, maybe in your tax bracket, not in mine. Oh, man. Play another game? Sure, why not? Oh, I might like getting whupped. You know what? - Rack 'em. - What do you mean? I won. Oh, okay, well, I'm going first, so... - Heh. Okay. - Rack 'em. Ladies first, all right. Do you mind if I ask you a question? Is there any way I can stop you? What happens after this weekend is over? What do you mean? Well, you and your lawyers find some clever way to protect your money in warp speed time, and then what? You hide all your assets in offshore accounts or...? Ah, you know, someone has been watching too many movies. Heh. - Movies, Twitter, Tik Tok. - Yeah. These are my go-tos for learning, in that order. Come on, George, you know what I'm saying. What happens when this is over? Are you going to downsize, move back to Queens? No. Don't really think I want to stay in New York. Think I want to downsize too. Why do you ask? Hmm. Just didn't seem like you really wanted to sell your penthouse. Maybe you should keep it. Well, people like my soon to be ex-wife, only thing that makes them happy is money, so sooner I sell, the faster I can come to a settlement and an agreement and get her out of my life. Just want this done, you know. George. - Um, you're rich. - Oh. You probably have dozens of properties you could sell. - That is true. - Mmm. You are absolutely right. I am rich. But penthouse property, that is the only one I bought with my heart. But it is my heart that got me in this current situation. Besides, it's a hot and sexy property. My lawyers tell me that if I put it on the market, it should get an offer within the hour. Hour, please. That place will be gone in minutes. The commission alone's like winning the lottery. Ah. Market-savvy yoga instructor. That's a first. Yeah, no, I'm like full namaste. - Oh, I see. - Uh, my sister is a realtor and, uh, she talks about it all the time. I think the lingo is just, ahem, rubbing off on me. You should talk to her. I mean, she probably knows more about this stuff than your lawyers do, right? Hmm. I don't know, I'm just a yoga instructor. Just a yoga instructor. Ah, I'll tell you what. Have her call my office on Monday. Just like that. Just like that. I trust you. From the moment I saw you, you made me feel at ease. Never felt more like myself until right now, with you. Really raising the bar for the next meet and greet. Heh. Well, that's my way to clear the way. For the second date. This is a date? I don't know. Tell me. Oh, my God. Oh, I don't know what just happened. I... Don't know what happened either. I'm pretty sure you and me were as close as one might... Okay, can we just not...? Can we just pretend it didn't happen, George? Just wait a second, wait. Okay, if that's how you want it. That's what I want. You know, because... - I don't... - Yeah. I don't believe in love at first sight. - Oh? - I'm jaded and I'm cynical. - I don't even like romcoms. - I see. But this isn't the first time we met, so give yourself a little wiggle room. But duly noted. The heat is on. Yeah, it is. In your room... - Oh, my God. - Through the vents. They said it should be on by this time. Heat is on in my room. Okay, yeah, thank you, ahem, for telling me that. That's what you were saying, the heat in my room. The heat in my room is on. What if I don't want to pretend that this didn't happen? If I want it to happen? Terri, you're a breath of fresh air... George, George, whatever you think I am, I'm not. Trust me. You're beautiful. You're smart. You calm me. - You're honest... - Okay, you know what? I think we should just keep this professional. I'm sorry, I definitely misled you. Just friends. Oh, good old friend zone, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay, friend. Friends. I'm going to go. I'm gonna go. Okay. - I'll walk you out? - No. Namaste. Namaste. I was hoping you could stay. Hmm. Hi, Shauna. What am I looking at? Is that a wall or a ceiling? It's a ceiling. Well, I didn't call to look at the cobwebs. I want to see my sissy. What's the matter? I can't tell if you're happy or sad. I don't know if I should ask you if the plan worked or if you kissed him? What if I told you both? Terri. I know, I know. I don't know what to do. If he finds out I'm a fraud, he will never forgive me. And if I tell him the truth, we lose the business. Look, I feel partly responsible for the situation you got yourself into. Oh, really? Do you think so? I know it. Are you sure about him? No. No. We just met. I mean, how can I be sure about him? He could be a serial killer. I mean, he could hate sushi, and you know what happens when we overlook guys who hate sushi. It's a very important detail. I mean, he could hate dogs. You hate dogs. No, I d... I hate big dogs. I love little dogs. They have cute names. So what are you saying? I don't know what I'm saying. I think he deserves the truth. I mean, honesty should be the least of it, right? Whatever you want to do, I'm going to support you. Shauna, what about our business? We'll figure it out, okay? You have to do what's best for you. I got you, sis. I don't know what I want to do. It'll come to you. Just sleep on it. Sleep on it. Mm-hmm. You're going to obsess about this all night, aren't you? I could write him a letter. That's a terrible idea. Please don't do that. Okay, I won't do that. I'll just sleep on it. It's been a long day. A little sleep will do you some good. You're right, you're right. I'll sleep on it. I love you. Bye. I love you. Yeah. Yes, yes. Mm-hmm. Oh. Hmm. Salutations! Mr. Camden felt horrible about the whole bag switcheroo thingy, so... you get a wardrobe! You get a wardrobe, you get a wardrobe, you get a wardrobe, you get a wardrobe! I get... I get a wardrobe. No, I get it. That's right, Santa came early this year. No, no, no. Stop, please. This is not nec... Thank you. This is not necessary. This doesn't even make any sense. Getting gifts around Christmas time doesn't make sense? No, I mean, of course that makes sense. But we did have a great night together and it was... We really connected like it could be something long-term, but you know, I just, I just met this guy. You know, I mean, this is too much. Well, you just met me and you already told me way too much. That's fair. This is... This is my problem. Wait, wait, wait, no, no. I will just tell him I can't accept. Is that a Fendi? No. No. No, I will just tell him no thank you and he'll understand. I'm sure he's not gonna mind having his kindness and generosity rejected. Exactly what I was going for. Just rejecting kindness. Thanks, Marvin. But wait, there's more. Okay, look, if this is about yesterday, I can explain. - Actually, I... can't. - Ah. Well, look what else Santa brought. Oh, thank you. Ooh. Thank you, Marvin. I don't know how I'm ever going to be able to repay you. Ah-ha... Yeah, we'll just tuck under there. Yeah, I just don't carry cash... Well, that's not a problem... I take Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, or you can CashApp me at $marvy1482. Okay. Marvin, I don't have any of those things and I need to deal with this, but I promise I am going to get you, I swear. - Okay, I will get you, I swear. - That's no problem. - You are the center of my universe. - Okay. - Let me know if you need anything. - Okay. By the way, I still need you to sign that waiver. Okay, bye! Kindness rejected, that's, that's my thing. Ha. Hi. You wanna...? Okay. Heh. Thanks. Venmo, is it? Oh. Heh. Fendi? Really? Anything? George, I just think that if we... Okay, well, come on, spit it out. We file for divorce in New York, not California. Okay. New York's divorce procedure differs drastically from that of California. In New York, there is no formal waiting period for a judge to grant a divorce where fault is alleged. So what are you telling me? We file for divorce in New York before she files in California. There's a mandatory six month waiting period in California. What does that mean? A court will not finalize a divorce before those six months are up. That can't be waived. Vivian can do a lot of damage in six months with your money. We file first in New York. Okay, what's next? Make her an offer. Uh, but before you do, liquidate your assets and fast. Fast, how fast? Is yesterday fast enough? I don't want the B-team here. I need you and the rest of the A-team. So get on a plane, drive a car, jump in a sleigh with reindeer, whatever you have to do, just please get here, all right? Thank you. Okay. Are you serious? Are you the only person that works here? - Heh. No. - Heh. Okay. But I lobbied for the opportunity to be the resort ambassador for the George Camden retreat. Okay. And how can I help you today? I just need to get in there, I'm, uh... Oh, I'm a part of the health and wellness team. Ah. Staff uses the side entrance. I'm not exactly staff. You just said you were. And you just saw the... You... The gifts? "You get a wardrobe!" - Okay. - I'm sorry, he's really busy in there right now. Yeah. Okay. Can you give him a message for me? - I can do that. - Great. Can you tell him that I need to talk to him? I will. And you are? Mm-hmm. Random angry lady. Thank you. George. Thank God, for a minute I didn't think you'd show. Why did you think that? Because I don't know you! Okay, why are you here? We have to yoga. We have yoga and we couldn't use the lodge. George has been super busy at his place, so now we're here. Just stand over there and look Zen-ish. - Zen-ish? - Yeah, just don't talk, okay? The last time you did, you got yourself a free trip, and next you guys are going to be kissing by the fireplace. Kissing by the pool table actually. What? Nothing. Listen, this is really important. Mr. Camden is really stressed and we have to have an extreme yoga session to calm him. Okay, Claudia, I really need to talk to him. Not my problem. It's important. My job is important, okay? I didn't do 200 hours of online yoga for nothing. If you have to talk to him, just do it after the session. - George. - Hello, hello. I need to talk to you. Whoa, you got gifts and presents. - Yes, I need to talk... - That's really good. Okay, no, I need to talk to you and that's kind of what this is all... And I need us to do yoga. - Claudia... - Mr. Camden, I prepared a beautiful session that I'm more than confident you'll enjoy. Not right now, Claudia, okay? I'm freaking out, thank you. Yoga might help. Yoga later, yes? Can we talk now, please? - Yes, thank you. - Thank you. Oh, gosh. All right, so you said that your sister is a real estate agent, correct? Yeah. Okay, is she good at what she does? - The best. - All right. I need her to sell my penthouse and fast. Can you please call her? George, slow down, wait a second. Is... Is this what you want? I have to sell it. Otherwise, it is an albatross hanging around my neck, okay? I don't think you want to do this. It's not about what I want. I need your sister's help. Can you please call, please? Of course. Yeah, I'll call her. Thank you. Like you're heaven-sent. God, you always know exactly what I need at the time that I need it and I appreciate it. Thank you for your help. No. What you mean, no? I can't help you, George. I won't call my sister. You trying to joke with me? You talkin' about a joke? George, you don't want to sell it. - Hmm? - Everyone's just running around here afraid to tell you that there's another way. Hey, I'm not a tyrant. If everyone is afraid to tell me the truth, obviously you didn't get the memo, huh? That's what we need to talk about, George. Oh, you know, if this is about the wardrobe, okay, in my defense, I had my assistant do that. Ah, it was after the phone call with your sister, but it was before the kiss. Which was really nice. It was before the kiss though, it really was. Okay, it's not about that. I mean, it is a little bit about that. So what is it about then? There's just another way. There has to be. You know there's another way? Well, I don't... I don't know, but doesn't there have to be a way to change course when you've made a mistake? But how do you know? Because I've made a huge mistake, George. And I'm praying with every fiber of my being that I can change course. Hey, it's gonna be all right, but what are you talking about? I have no idea. I just need it to be true. Terri, Terri, Terri, Terri. You seem more stressed. Maybe you're the one that needs to lighten up. It's going to be all right, all right? Isn't that the pot calling the kettle black? Yes. I have... I have to tell you, George. I'm falling for you. Okay, I said it. Well... Stop... No. - This is crazy, George, stop. - I mean it is crazy, but look, us meeting, you kissing me. Twice, yeah? I'm keeping count. And then the realtor that you recommended me, and then you won't, you won't call her when I need you to call her, right? All of this is happening while I'm planning my divorce about a woman that's cheating on me. Matter of fact, I'm afraid it's going to cost me millions of dollars. Oh, I really just can't stand her, but... through all of this, all I keep thinking about is another moment, another moment with you. Terri? Alex? What are you doing here? Would you believe... Dude, why do you look so familiar? Baby, it's George Camden. Yeah, I met you guys at the slopes the other day. Right, you're married to the famous woman, the one who's divorcing the rich dude. Yeah. Uh, do you know this guy? They were just leaving. Goodbye, Alex. Well, we should hang out. How... How do you know him? Just, just, we just know each other from work. - Can we go? - Oh, so you're a yoga instructor too, huh? No, I'm lactose intolerant. I'm a real estate agent. We were competing real estate agents. Actually, we were, we were engaged - and we had an apartment and... - Oh, Walking Dead. And we used to watch Walking Deadtogether. Oh. You what? I'm a sucker for zombie movies, what can I say, bro? Yeah, not that. Um, what? George. Engaged? A real estate agent? Hey, she's the top agent in Manhattan. Oh... - What are the odds of that? - Please, please, you have to let me explain. - George, you have... - You don't have to explain. What's his problem? So no drinks? We can get drinks, baby. Oh, baby. Merry Christmas. Hello? Welcoming committee. Okay. Yeah. I thought you'd be buried under your blanket. What are you doing here? What I should've been doing all along, helping you run this place. - Terri... - Let me show you something. I know that I blew it with the penthouse. You didn't blow anything. I did, but I've been doing research, okay? And I have landed us three new listings. Not as nice as the penthouse and the commission won't be as massive, but this will get us through the month. - Terri... - Look, I already called. I got us extensions. It's Christmas. No one is that cruel. I am making this work. Terri, stop. This is my fault. I should've never asked you to do this. Shauna, please don't, okay? Because you were right, this is what I'm good at. It's the love life that's the whole other thing. I'm going to let you do this to yourself. I'm not. Doing it to myself, okay? I've been moping and I'm done playing that song. I can't control all of the other... All of the mistakes and all of... This, I can fix this. - I'm going to save this firm... - Sis. Even if I have to work through Christmas to do it. - Terri. - Shauna. We need to talk. Yes, I'm talking to you. And so who are you and how did you know I was here? I think you two should talk. You owe me big for this one. I got you. So if you're one of those Vivian drones or paparazzi or just looking for a sucker to take advantage of, just so I can let you know in advance, I'm all used up. I'm here about Terri. Like I said, I'm all used up. You're making a mistake. And who are you again? I'm her sister. Yeah, I should've known. What was the plan, huh? Find a vulnerable rich guy, make him fall head over heels for her, then just use him? Been there, done that. So what are you gonna do? Yeah, that's what I thought. A business card. The first time you guys met, she was going to give you our business card and make the pitch to use our company. So you come to my yoga studio. Couldn't just make an appointment? Have you met you? That would have taken years. Look, I know we went about it the wrong way, but don't blame her, blame me. And what if I want to blame both of you? Blaming me is better. She really likes you, Mr. Camden. And from what I can tell, you really like her too. Because if you didn't, you wouldn't be sitting here still. Well, how about now that I'm not? Okay. You're right. What we, mostly me, did was wrong. Let me ask you. Does being right change the way you feel about my sister? Oh, man. Anything? Come on, Farrah, this isn't rocket science. Yeah, it's more nuanced. I mean, do, do you have any what you're asking? Yes. In addition to stopping Vivian, I want you to help me sue my yoga instructor's assistant. - Can we do that? - Well, I'm Farrah Hightower. I can make any and all things happen. That's what I'm talking about. Uh, but I do have one question. What is it? On what grounds? Come on, you know, she... I don't know. Look, that's why I pay you. You figure that out. Okay. George... Okay, look, I am not aware of any legal principle that requires someone to be truthful with their significant other, or potential significant other. Okay. Uh... Uh, uh... What about fraud? Yeah, you know, uh, breach of promise? There you go, bingo. Breach of promise. Wow, that's a... Maybe, just maybe you met someone and you made a real connection. Come on, man, you know, it happens. Okay, just keep working. - Yeah. - Yeah. Uh-huh. Whew, okay. Breach of promise, I'll have to write that down. I know, I know it's Christmas Eve, but if you give us that listing, I swear to you, no one will work harder for you. You will? Great, I will send the contracts over tomorrow and we... Not tomorrow, tomorrow is Christmas. Obviously. Um, enjoy your holiday. I will send that paperwork over soon. And, um, again, thank you and Merry Christmas. I just got us two new listings. And you don't seem... Did someone ruin your coffee? What? What are you doing still here? It's funny that you would ask. I'm just in here saving your whole life. I mean, look what I found. Could you imagine if somebody else had found this evidence? Look, I can explain about... Yep, I'm sure you can. I mean, I'm sure you have a reasonable explanation for lying, but why print up every single picture on her social media? Right? Right. Ugh. You see this one? Oh, and what about this one? Because this right here... Sorry I got you into this mess. Don't. What you did is give me motivation. It's not like we're living in a romantic comedy. You know, we're not defined by whatever relationship we have with a guy. We're business women, we tried to land a deal, it didn't go our way, so can we just drop it? You would've made a cute couple though. Okay. No more man talk, subject change. Oh, and this one. This is definitely proof of manipulation. I get it. Do you though? I mean, you're standing here in the office kitchen with your attorney on Christmas Eve. You're here too. Well, I'm trying to avoid my mother-in-law. What's your excuse? Thank you. You're welcome. Merry Christmas. Mr. Camden. Merry Christmas to you as well. Heh. See you later, George. - Terri. - Hmm? - Shauna. - What is this? I told you, no money for gift exchange this year. Yeah, well, this is also our first Christmas without Dad. Fine. With a card for coffee. I know it's not much, but it's the least I could do for the one who's been burning the midnight oil to keep us afloat. - I love it. - Do you? It's perfect. - I love you. - I love you too. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - Give me a Twizzler. Heh. - Ah! I want it, I want it, I want it. Fine. What do you want to watch? Shauna, your feet, gross. Answer the door, I don't have any friends. - It's for you. - All right. Coming! Sis, the FBI's here, somebody in a suit, FBI. Look at the guy. Just go get the door. - For me? - Go. But why? Is this about the tipping? Not this time. What is this? I'm not at liberty to say. Marvin, what are you doing here? I'm not at liberty to say. Not at liberty to say. Okay... - Sis... - Who's this? This is the bellhop, the ski instructor bellhop. Heh. Former bellhop that she was telling you about. - Oh. What's he doing here? - Great. He's not at liberty to say. What's that? He won't tell me. So open it. Is this a bill? You're not at liberty to say, right. This is "Please meet me..." Will you be attending? There'll be a car waiting for you downstairs if the answer's yes. Terri. What now, Marvin? I'm not at liberty to say. I didn't think you would show. You're a hard man to say no to. - Terri... - George. Can I go first, please? I'm sorry. What I did was wrong and I did have my reasons, George, but... You're such a great guy and I wanted to tell you the truth, George. I've heard it all before. George, please. But I really have heard it all before. I'm the one that should be apologizing. I wanted to tell you the truth about... but I was afraid that if I did, we'd have never gotten the chance to know one another. And I'm ashamed of how we met. Oh, I will regret it if you read one more word. I will regret it if we don't give each other a second chance to start over. I just, and I shouldn't have. I'm the fool. Heh. How did you...? Marvin, he found it in your cabin. That's why you hired him? Not at liberty to say. Your sister, she helped a lot as well. I bet. Don't tell me you're going to hire her too. No. So why here? This is where we met. This is where everything just... Fell into place? Fell into place. I'm going to keep the penthouse. Got some really good advice on that. I think your sister can help me unload the other properties I have. I'm gonna keep it. Think I wanna raise a family there. Pretty sure my mother would be proud. She's so proud. Yeah. There's one other thing. I promised I'd get you another one. - For me? - Yeah. Aw... Heh. Open? By all means. I love it. It's really perfect. How about that first lesson? Hey. Do you see it? I know, so pretty. Did I ever tell you, before Daddy passed, he made me promise to look after you? I know, it's kind of funny, right? It's always been the opposite. You are my little guardian angel. Come on, sis, you know there's no crying in Gotham City. I'm not crying. You're the one who's crying. You're always the one who's crying. I love you. I love you, love you, love you, love you, I love you! Love is not a big enough word to describe my feelings for you, sis. You have been our rock, a rock for me and a rock for our family. You saved us, you saved our business. I'm so happy for you and you deserve all of this. Joy cometh in the morning, like Dad always said. Heh. Yes, he did. I'll see you when you get back. And I'm helping you with the wedding plans because you have tacky tendencies. Okay. So thoughtful, thank you. Your love story's coming next... I love you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - Hey. Cheers. - Cheers. - So? - So? What do you think? Think it's beautiful, just like you. No, don't change anything. - Okay, I just... - I like it there. All right, no problem. It can stay. Thank you. You're welcome.
