A Mongolian prince taught me this, Taylor. An ingenious device for the right occasion. You'll never lie to a friend again. And you'll never kiss another man's wife. Where is Bob Taylor? - He went on his own there. - Alone? Well, after what happened last night I met him, he tell he shouldn't stay with us. - What did he say? - He didn't say anything. It's Taylor's. I can't find white man. I guess it's eaten. Evelyn, you got to forget the Orient. I know it was horrible, you can't go on like this. Eric, I never want to see that country again. Now, why don't you take a stroll around the deck. I'll catch up with you. I'm getting a wilds of Dr. Evans zoo. What are you laughing about? Just what I wanted to find out. - What? - She can smile. Roger, I'm seriously worry about you, please don't let him see us together again. He'll be out any minute. He's making a racket of you Evelyn, because you're all tied and knotted. Something peculiar about your husband. Something I can quiet make out. Oh, let's not talk of him. We mustn't talk about anything. Evelyn, don't go, Evelyn. We got to talk, Evelyn. Tomorrow we will enter the harbor. - We're docking tomorrow. - I told you it's hopeless. But you can go on living with Gorman. You can break your life because you made one mistake. Eric would never let me go. Please Roger, he'll be coming any minute. - I'm going to have with him. - But you can't. I know him, I know what his doing. On the exhibition a man named Taylor tried to kiss me. My husband saw it. The next night he was found in the jungle dead. The tigers had been there, there no way of probing an... It's the most interesting group my husband has ever brought back. Everyone is talking about. - The ship hold as a regular menagerie. - Good evening, Mr. Hewitt. Good evening. My wife has been telling you about my animals? Yes, she has. I've no idea you were interested in animals. Perhaps you'd like to come along with me and see them? - It's rather late, isn't it? - Maybe your right. They'll be at the public zoo up tomorrow. I would like to have you see them. - I'll enjoy it. - Splendid. It would be a great pleasure to introduce you to the zoo. - I have a message for Professor Evans. - Follow that path to the right. - You'll find him at the office. - Thank you. - Well, I need back to work. - Oh, don't go yet, Jack. That one keep flirting with you and I'm getting jealous. You'll have to choose between us. You have a message for somebody? - I am looking all over for Prof. Evans. - They are nice, aren't they? He's over there, in the laboratory building. Thank you. Thank you. This is Evans, of the zoo. I have a man in my outside office named Peter Yates. Applying for the job of press agent. Gave your name for reference. - He seems quiet bright. - Yates, he's Ok, he's a fair guy. I hate to disturb you Dennison, but what about him? - He drinks a little now and then. - Ha, you layoff him easy. Oh, is my last chance. He brush in top on every job in this town. Mr. Evans, Mr. Dennison out is a gross falsehood. Well, I admire your nerve. Yeah, I had a hunch you would. - Come in. - Yeah, right behind you. Young man, your recommendations are satisfactory. We do need a press agent. The zoo is in desperate financial stress and we want every bit of public interest and support we can get, but... Well, then you can go wrong with old man Yates's boy pick. Why, I put more business on the blink scary a map, than anyone two men since Mason and Dickson foot left their famous line. Who the hell would've heard of Niagara Falls until old Pete came along. Look, I got a picture somewhere here. There your are, there it is. See, there am I standing on the bridge. You can't miss in the fall, can you? - No, no. - Well, that's efficiency. And if you turn to page 48 you will see why I made Bimsons combinations button hook and can opener a household world. And that's just a small idea of my ideas. And besides, I need the job, am I in? Well, I must admit Mr. Yates, I'm favorably impressed. But, do you know anything about animals? They been my constant companions many of nights. - I mean... - That's bring me the point. About your drinking. Oh Mr. Evans, I will be frank with you. There was a time in my life through sorrow and financial reverses, but I have sworn off. Do you believe me when I tell you I haven't tasted a single drop for... Well, I considerable time, a long time. Two days and three weeks, to be exact. Well, I give you a chance. Thanks. Consider the zoo as a success. There here is your first assignment. Mr. Gorman gets off the boat from India this morning. Hey, you're able to start with a good story, wouldn't you? Oh, it's a natural to have in the front page of every paper. Good, you come with me I'll introduce you to Dr.Woodford. Yeah, be glad to. Oh, oh excuse me. Maybe someone else wants to see this. Woodford is my associate. He is a very clever young biochemist and toxicologist Jack, I want you to meet Peter Yates. This is Dr. Woodford. - How are you? - Yeah, I'm Ok. I just hire Mr. Yates to head of our publicity. - Good, we needed. - Yeah, that's what I think. Hand me the bottle of Bethane disulfonic acid. Ii did it? No, don't mind, I'll get it. Oh I'm sorry, I'm strange here, you know. - I think you better go out to the boat. - Yeah, good idea. - Hello, Dad. - Hello, dear. This is my daughter Jerry. Mr. Yates is our new press agent. - How do you do? - Well, I'm feeling much better. Well, well, this is a swell place you have here. - You think so? - Yes, sure. - Oh, my. Stuffed? - Yes. There nice that way. Oh, look it. Hey, you got to have this place screened. Oh, not locust Mr. Yates, rattlesnake. - She don't like your book of clipping. - Oh my God. Here's the time to meet the boat and I find myself waiting worthy hours with snakes. Well, goodbye all. - Oh, you forget your book. - Let them read it. Oh, for goodness sake. I just saw Pete Yates, looking for Gorman. - What do you suppose he want? - Probably a drink. No, he's on the wagon, he's working for the zoo. Come in. OH, how do you do? I'm Pete Yates, Mr. Gorman. In Publicity Department for the animals. This is Mr. Hewitt, Mr. Yates. Oh, my goodness, did you get in the wrong, did I get in the wrong cabin again? - How are you? - I'm Mrs. Gorman. Oh, I beg your pardon again. Where can I find Mr. Gorman? He's down in the hall, getting ready to unload the animals. Animals? Yes, thanks. I rush right down there. I beg your pardon, but would be asking to much if I inquire what kind of animals? Oh, all kinds. Tigers, wild boars, panthers, rhinoceros... - Did you say rhinoceros? - Yes. Yes, of course, rhino, rhinoceros. Well, goodbye now. Rhino... When he knocked, I thought it was Eric. Oh, please, don't stay here longer, Roger. - Promise you get in touch with me tomorrow? - I promise it. You better go. Yes, I promise you stop being afraid. If I only could. Let me handle your afraid problem. It will be lots of fun. - Where can I find Mr. Gorman? - Over there. I'm afraid she has a cold. You want to see me? Yes, I'm, I'm Peter Yates from Municipal Zoo. - Oh, yes. - Publicity Department for animals. I came to hear the story from you about, about these things. Fine, fine. - A cute little thing, isn't it? - Yes, shake hands. Oh no, no. I never met the gentleman. It is a lady. R3eally, Mr. Gorman I... Mr. Yates, shouldn't be afraid of wild animals. Let them alone and they will leave you along. That must you can say about humans. You don't meant say you really like these beasts. I love them. Their honesty, their simplicity, their primitive emotions. They love, they hate, they kill. - I'm speaking of tigers. - No, no, I, I didn't say a word. Mr. Gorman, I... Mr. Gorman... I have some reporters on deck and... some photographers who are very anxious to take some pictures of you. I'd like to have you pose with Mrs. Gorman, she is very attractive. - You met her? - Yes, I hope I didn't offended her. Offended? Well you see, I thought the gentleman in the stateroom with her was you. Tell, was Mr. Hubert or Herbert or whatever? - Hewitt... - Hewitt yes, was he part of the expedition? No, no, just a very good friend. You know Eric, the size of your new collection worries me. Whether If we haven't room for them all we'll built some new cages. Yes, yes, with thicker bars. That doesn't seem to be exactly the problem, it's the expenses of it. You know Eric, since you've been gone, you don't seem to realize our budget it's been cut four times. Good heavens, man. Why didn't you cable me? I know what I'll do. I'll get to some of the most influential men in town. And we make up the differences by private subscriptions. - Oh, that would be wonderful. - But how? I, I beg your pardon, Mr. Gorman. I have a grand idea. Why not give a dinner here? Spread on a long table among all these magnificent animals. Think of it. Photographs in every paper. Ha, I can see the front-page now. Lovely ladies languishing among lions and lamas. Multimillionaires medicating amid monkeys and mongooses. Yeah, monguises. Enthusiasm, novelty, contributions pouring in. Fantastic. How would you like to eat with lions and tigers? Well, if we had the dinner late, then they will be all sleepy. I wonder... I do think the thing has values, it's clamorous. Let us do it. I'll attend to the arrangements. - You, you mean to say you like the idea? - Immensely. Oh, for good a sake. Well, that's just the small idea of my ideas. - Mr. Evans, consider the banquet a success. - Just a moment. Woodford, this is something you should interested particularly. - What's this? - A snake. A green mamba. A new variety I pick up in India. It kills hundreds of natives every year and no antitoxin has ever been developed for her. I thought you might want to work on it. That's great, I'll start this afternoon. It won't be easy, it's a swift active poison there is. We'll see what we can do, how about it Jerry? All right, Jerry. Good. Right after lunch, we'll see what we can do to make the world safe from mambas. You have to find an antitoxin after all Mr. Gorman it's done. You know, I'd break a leg for the dear old zoo. That Gorman bird is said of the animals friend, but... I know what you were going to say. - You were going to say that's he's... - He's what? Oh, isn't not nice to dislike him after he's be so kind. You realize what the success of his plans would mean to us? I can go on with my laboratory work. And you'll have to quit stalling about marrying me. - Mr. Roger Hewitt? - Apartment 8B. - Shall I announce you, sir? - Isn't necessary. He expects me. - But Roger... - Do not argue with me. You sail for Paris Friday. I warn you. When we are married, I'm going to run this family. Here your ticket. Don't be worry darling, you will be guarded in Paris night and day. I look after that. But... I got to but those buts out of your system. You bring your passport? In the moment I get my divorced, You'll come over in next boat. No, on the boat just ahead of your divorce. Everything seems so simple when I'm with you. - I wouldn't marry this girl. - I don't blame you. - You cable me every day. - No. - What? - I'm calling you. - Darling. - Come in. Mr. Gorman to see you. Go in that room. Ask him in. - Hello, Hewitt. - Gorman, how are you? Splendid. I've pup in to have a little chat. - Fine. Cigarette? - Thank you. You know... I was rather surprised to find that a man like you just take an interest in something which is... shall we say, outside of his province. I mean, on the boat you and I seemed to have... - a mutual interest. - I'm afraid I don't quite understand. I was referring to my animals. Good. I'm giving a little dinner at the zoo on Thursday night. I'd like to have you there. I'll be delighted to come. We try to raise some money. I know you're one the few fortunate who still have a little left. I thought perhaps you might have to give a notable contribution. - Well, certainly, can count on me. - That's final then. - I hope I hadn't disturb you. - Oh, not at all. Good. - Until Thursday then. - I'll be there. I can promise you a really unusual evening. Ah, ladies, ladies, you don't realize how fascinating these wonderful animals really are. Really. Stop the man. Stop, stop the man. Stop that man. Take your hand of there. Don't pull it, don't pull anything. Is all right ladies, be calm, everything will be all right. - What's the matter? - Matter, matter... That's for when they want to clean the cages, that's for if they have a fire, they pull that thing and wind go outcome every lion, every bear, every tiger into new cages. But the little cages aren't there. And if you pull that thing, Oh me, Oh my, Oh mercy. OH, put it back on the hook. Here's the story: Photographer almost releases avalanche of animals on zoo banquet yesterday. No, not boys. Boys listen. Listen, no, that's not the right attitude. I'd tell you, we got to make this thing lovable, pleasant and beautiful. See, and, and, and beautiful. He loves me. Now look... When I'm at the pinned table and I make my speech and I dos this. See, that's your signal for take the flash lights, you got it? - Ok, we got it. - Don't forget now. Hello Doc. - Say, do we eat? - Oh, sure. That's just the small idea of my ideas. Oh, miss it. Ladies and gentlemen... if you all gather around and find your respective places we'll put on the feed... Will party it of the refreshments you'll find we have all on the menu, from soup to... nuts. - Roger? - Someone is been very thoughtly. I think,.. Ladies and gentlemen. Friends... Friends... it is with keening heart and warm fraternal hand... that I welcome you to the zoo. This is the zoo of zoos. You may search up the entire world and never would you find another zoo such as this zoo. This is... This is a zoo, beyond any question of a doubt that you can go, you may look, you may search as I said before, you may go from India to Newark and never would you... - find... - Come on boys, there is the signal. Let's take some pictures before Yates close his ear off. Your attention, please. Photo, still. Don't anybody move. Thank you. Thank you, boys. It is however, with the posting love and gratitude in my throat, that that I wish to thank Mr. Eric Gorman, for not only sponsoring this delicious and splendid banquet, but for bringing back from India with him... some of the worst, some of the best most interesting animals in this wild universe to entertain and intrigue you. Keep your places everyone, Mr. Hewitt is fainted. Dr. Woodford will take care of him. - Get him out of here, doc. - Yes, bring him this way. Right this way. Please stay here and help keep the others calm. Put it on the table. He was holding his leg. It's swelling. It looks like a snakebite. Do we have any snakes with fangs such as wild as that? - Maybe is a mamba bite. - See if that mamba is on it's cage. If it's a mamba, the chance is no good. I see a dozen cases like that in India. He was dead within five minutes. You mean the snake was in there among all those people? Gorman, get everybody away from that table. I'll do what I can. There's no antitoxin, it's nothing you can do for him. The mamba is gone, it's cage is open. I'll try to keep everyone quiet. Get out of here, everybody, is a poisonous snake loose... Get away from that table, there's a poisonous snake under. It's a mess all, Fred, grab some pictures. Where's their telephone? Come on, Freddy, let's go. Where's a telephone Miss Evans? Where's the phone, I'm of the Morning Records. Please, don't you see that is for everything is skate-out, everything. Skate-out? Going to be a sensation. Oh yeah, just as soon not be suppose to it. Come on, let's find it. - Where is Evelyn? - I don't know. This is horrible, unforgivable. Well Woodford, it's been a rush of such chances of bring me outside help. I know it, I can understand how that snake got out. Loose carelessness on your part and it might be six people as well as of one. Mr. Gorman, it wasn't his fault and I know it. I saw him put the snake in the cage and closed it, I've been with him minute. Come Evelyn, I want to get you out of here, dear. You are trembling. Let me get you some brandy. You killed Roger Hewitt. No my dear, you're not yourself. Drink some of this. That's why you sat oppose him. Evelyn... you don't think I sat there all evening with a eight foot mamba in my pocket, do you? Why, It would be an injustice to my tailor. I don't know how it happened. But why would he stroke and no one else? Why aren't you more concern with my narrow escape? - I sat within two feet of the snake... - Oh, don't touch me. - I've never saw you looked more beautiful. - Yes Eric, I know. - Now you're going to make love to me. - I never wanted you more than now. - Oh, you're not human. - I'm not going to kiss you... - You're going to kiss me. - Kiss you? I hate you. Hear, Roger and I loved each other. I was going to leave you for him. Now will you let me go. My dearest... why didn't you come and tell me? You know I have to giving affection to ever stand in your way. What do you... - What is it that makes me love you so? - I hate you. Open up, open the door, Evelyn. I'm coming back in five minutes and I expect to find this door open. Guard. - Is Dr. Woodford here? - He is at the house. - I'm Mrs. Gorman, I got to see him. - Certainly, Mrs. Gorman. My dear you don't know what you're doing. - Give that, give it to me. - Let me alone. - Hear now, you're all up are excited. - You killed him with it. You murder Roger just as you murder Taylor. Anything I've done, I've done because I love you. If I like to come to kill you... I couldn't expect to you go on loving me. Put your off hands away, don't touch me. I hate you. I hate you. Come along... Les, let's go home. You expect me to go home and forget you're not human? You think you'll never be find out? Your wrong. - I going to tell everyone. - Just about enough. You can't fright me anymore, I'm going to tell them all... That you are a murderer, that you have no right to live. I'll make sure they hang you, I don't care what they do to you. Please let us in mister, we can not see step out.. Sorry, we can't let anyone in until we find the snake. We are no afraid of no snakes. Fred and Jim sneak in there, I've seen them do it. They have no business to. Sam, get those boys out. It's dangerous. You kids ought to be glad you're not in there. But out here we sure don't have any fun. Look what I got in the stick. Looks like somebody got ate. Maybe we'll find a package with some money in. Hey you kids, you got to get out of here. Nobody is allow in the zoo. Oh, we won't hurt nothing, mister, we've been here hundreds of times. I'm sorry boys, but you got to go. No one is allowed. What you got there? That's just part of a lady's dress. We fished out of the pond. You boys get out of here in a hurry. Some children sneaked in here fished out the alligator pond. There some other pieces floating around in the water. - Who was at the main gate last night? - Perry. - Where is he now? - Down the quarts. Is Perry there? I want to speak to him. Perry, anyone come in the gate last night? Mrs. Gorman came in here last night, wanted to see you. Hello. No, she isn't here, Woodford. She hadn't been here the whole night. I'm very worried about. I called all her friends. I can't understand. Wish you hurry over right away, I'm afraid something dreadful is happened. I'll come right over. What is it Evans? Something about Evelyn? For heaven's sake, tell me then. We are not sure. Can you identify this? Why yes. I. I believe is part of a dress that... belong to Eve. Is she dead? For some reason that I don't know... Mrs. Gorman came to the zoo last night to see me. She never reach the house. This morning Baker found that... in the alligator pit. But, why did she come here? - Why did she come here, Woodford? - I tell you, I don't know. You'll never know Eric, Woodford is telling the truth. This is a frightful thing, if there's anything on earth that we con do. There's nothing you can do. You were responsible for the Hewitt death. Your carelessness and stupidity, and now my wife has died here. Died, horrible again because a carelessness. I'm done with this zoo, Evans, It's a public menace. I going to see the city close before anymore of these cases happens. And for you, Woodford... I'm going to have you prosecute for complete negligence. And the charge ought to be manslaughter. What? No, this is the zoo. The zoo. ZOO. Yeah, what? Oh, what you said? Hey Lion, cut up, will you? I'm shaving. I know you boys have families. Hate to let you go but there's nothing else I can do. - So long Mike and get luck. - Thank you. - Well, so long, Johnny. - So long, Johnny. - I'll be seeing you. - Bye. - Oh, do you want to see me? - Oh, yes Mr. Yates. Father is going to San Francisco to try to sell the animals. - I know you're press agent. - Yeah, Publicity Department for the animals. That's what I mean. I hate to ask you, but... if we don't know you can stay and help us with them must are going to starve. Yeah, good. - What? - No, no, no. I'm, I... Oh why, of course, I'll be very glad to help. Baker, Mr. Yates is going to help us out. - That's fine. - Sure, any little thing that I... Yeah, follow me. Oh, for Golly's sake. - Anything I can do something for you, Peter? - I could use some perfume. Now look, I'll only be here for a little while longer if it there's something else you can look at. Oh, Help, help, help. - What's wrong, Peter? - It's the ma, ma, ma, ma, mamba. I'll get a stake, hold it. Oh, you don't think I let her go, do you? Help. There it go, Peter. This is one decent press story you'll be able to get to the papers, Peter. Peter, Peter, speak to me, say something. Is there a good laundry in this town? - I won't be off to dinner. - Know I bring you something on the tray. Sometimes when I see you working so late at night I wonder if you're going to make a very good husband. I only have a few more days left in this laboratory... - and I've lots of work to finish. - Oh, you don't have to explain, dear. Yes, what is it, Woodford? If I were you I hurry up here right away. I just make a discovery that would interest you. I'm not interested in anything you have to say. - It could come down in court. - Fits me perfectly. On second thought, I'm going to hold back what I have found out until we get to court. - What you mean? - I don't care to discuss it over the phone. Alright, I'll come over. Come in. Good evening. Sit down, Gorman. Yes, well, what is it? Why didn't you tell me about the other mamba you brought back? Other mamba? I don't know what you talking about. The mamba that killed Hewitt. The mamba you killed Hewitt with. Why, my friend you are mad. Hewitt was like one of the family. And that's the motive you brought me here for? Why, it isn't even funny. Trying to cloak your own negligence by accusing me. Look at this, Gorman. We found the mamba today, I measured the fangs. The spread is entirely different from that on the wound in Hewitt leg. A brilliant discovery. And you intermediately judged the conclusion that I have another. There's no other conclusion possible. Here's the measurement of the fangs of this mamba. And here's the measurement of the bite on Hewitt's leg. A difference of 8 millimeters. No Gorman, this mamba never killed Hewitt. Another one did. And by your own admission no one but you in the country could have one. A large and vicious snake... That I carry under to a banquet and trained to bite my friend but not my wife who was sitting next to him. Your wife was coming here to tell me of the other snake on the night she was killed. I think I know how she met her death. Very ingenious, not you, Woodford? I told the truth, Woodford. There was only one mamba. Ah, Woodford, Oh, Woodford... - Hello. - Hello. You happens to know where Dr. Woodford is? He called me and asked me to come over. He was in the laboratory. We found the mamba this afternoon and he probably ought to show to you. Oh, Jack... Jack. - Why look... - What is it? The mamba. - Jack. - She must have escaped. He's been able to kill her before he felt. He's alive, I'll get the antitoxin. - What? - Antitoxin, we finished it today. Antitoxin? - Can I help? - No thanks, I got it. Call a doctor. Hello Hello... All right, all right, sweetie I'll hold your head on. Peter Yates, Publicity Department of the animals, speaking. Gorman? What? He killed? Police? Did he shoot it? Did what? Police, yes, yes, yes, yes. Hello, hello, Dan, Dan. Yes, sound the alarm right away. No, no, never mind asking why. Sounded, sounded, go on. I'll tell you later. This is Whiff, there's a trouble at the zoo. Ok. It's got him. Dr. I like to congratulate on your antitoxin. It's a splendid piece of work. So far has worked on three guinea pigs, two rabbits and one Woodford. Say, where can I find Peter Yates? Well, just go outside and yell you're from a newspaper, he'll turn up.
