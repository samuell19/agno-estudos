Jan! Josef! They sent for you, too. What the hell is it all about? I was on leave, out of the blue they called me back. That's all I know. So? The general will see you now. Stand at ease. Do you three know each other? Uh... Kubis and I do sir, but... uh... Alright, introduce yourselves. Karel Curda, sir. Born near Prague. I was a customs officer before the war. Jan Kubis. Born in Vladaslov. I was a farmer. Gabcik, sir. Josef Gabcik. Born in Pilsen, Locksmith. Good. The mission we have in mind... can only be undertaken by men with your qualifications. For the past three months you've been closely observed. You're here now because you've shown us that you have courage, endurance and resourcefulness. I am going to ask you to undertake a mission, that regardless of outcome, will certainly be one of the most dangerous of the war. I need hardly say it, you are at liberty to refuse. Good! First, I am going to give you some background information... and then I'll talk about the mission itself. The Code name is "Operation Day Break". Reinhard Heydrich came to Prague three months ago to take up his post as acting Reich Protector for what the Nazis now call "Bohemia and Moravia". That means he has absolute power of life and death over all Czechs. We believe if Adolph Hitler were to die, that Heydrich would become F?hrer of the Third Reich. His orders: one, to crush all Czech resistance... two, to deport large numbers of the community to work in Germany as slave labor. Do not underestimate him. He is not a barbarian like Himmler. He is the man of the highest intelligence... ruthless, ambitious and he is the only one to whom Adolph Hitler really listens. Herr Reich Protector... I have a petition signed by all the inhabitants of a small village near Pilsen. Begging you, sir, to show mercy to the nine young hostages due to be executed tomorrow. Not one of them is yet twenty years old, the youngest is only sixteen. The villagers do feel that... Reich Protector says that whatever happens to a Czech... or to any Slav, is of no possible interest to him. We intend to parachute you back into Czechoslovakia. To assassinate Heydrich. Heydrich is closely guarded night and day. When ever he travels, he is escorted by highly trained SS men. So it will be up to you to formulate a plan and to carry it out. You must find a way to kill him. When do we leave, sir? You'll be confined to these headquarters until further orders. Thank you very much. Good luck. Stand by chaps, we're over Pilsen. Home to mother! Stop! Don't try anything. You're Czech aren't you? Keep walking. Well, I am Czech too. Move! Jan! - Twisted my bloody ankle. - Can I have a look? Don't touch it for Christs sake! If I catch the bastard who said we were gonna drop on a dry clear morning... Did you see Curda? No, he drifted off in the other valley. He could be anywhere. Let me lean on you. Damn shame. Enough silk there to make knickers for half the girls in Czechoslovakia. Even the snow tastes different. Typical... You've got no feelings at all. Can you manage? Feels worse than it is, come on. Papers, your papers. Where are you going at this time of the morning? To work. Where? Pilsen. Walk to work everyday. You walk two hundred kilometers everyday? You're no where near Pilsen. Where have you come from? Hands. Hands! Come on! Let's go. Bastard R.A.F., two hundred kilometers from Pilsen. Dropped in a wrong bloody place. God knows where Curda is. So now what do we do? Lost the radio operator... I can hardly walk... and the entire German army looking for us. Never mind where we're going, we don't even know where we are. And you're a lot of use. No feelings at all. Christ, we're in a quarry. Two men. I know you're in there. It's alright. We won't harm you. I'm coming in. Come inside, both of you. Close the door. You can't stay here. You're parachutists. Look, we can all be shot. I've got a wife and children. I've hurt my foot. We need some help. But the place is swarming with Germans. Really! I haven't spoken to you... and I haven't seen you, Please go away. See who it is. Germans. Get into those overalls. Parachutists. Have you seen anybody? Tell him you've seen nothing. - But what about... - Do it before he comes. Well, have you seen anything? It's serious. Ah, it's you! What's going on in there, eh? One of my men, got hurt in the blast. His foot. Give us a lift to the doctor. I'll make it worth your while. You've been pinching somebody's ducks again? Better than that. Bring him. Over here. Thank you. Good morning. Is your father in? What's it about? Emergency. We're from the quarry. This fellow's hurt his foot. Come this way please. Father, two men from the quarry. One's hurt his foot. Show them in. Go in please. Lie down. Take off your shoe and sock. How did it happen? I fell... twisted my ankle. Can you move the toes? That's good. I haven't seen you before, have I? No. Does that hurt? How long have you been working at the quarry. Well, about six months now. It's a sprain. Nothing serious. The Germans are busy this morning, ...looking for parachutists. Yes, we heard. Yes, they've been searching the whole area. I expect they were up at the quarry. Oh, yes. Yes the quarry would be a good place for the parachutists to hide. But I doubt if they'll get very far. Not now. Now no one will shelter them. Not after murdering those Germans. Everybody will be too frightened. Put your finger there, will you? Stand up. That will do. I won't hesitate to shoot. Sonia! Yes, these are the other two. You will forgive me? We have to make sure you're not spies planted by the Nazis. Welcome home. Oh God! You bastard! Adult education? Come in. Find a place. Good afternoon. For the benefit of the those who are entering for the higher certificate, today we are going to talk about positive and negative ions. You managed to convince our friends in the country as to your identity. Now you must convince us. Marvelous isn't it? Come a thousand miles to help... How do you mean convincing? We want proof. We don't carry papers signed by Winston Churchill, if that's what you mean. What was the name of your commanding officer in England. Answer the question. We are Czechs. We were born here and we've come back to fight... and that's all we're telling you You say you're Czechs. Your home, where is it? Vladaslov. I know Vladaslov. What's unusual about the bridge there? It doesn't exist. Huh? Why? It was blown up in '39. Anyone could know that. I was a member of a group that lay the explosives. There were three of us caught by the Germans, I was one of them. Anyone could say that too. Get dressed. So now you see... We have both positive and negative particles in a vacuum. Karel. Where did you come from? Don't ask me any questions. I... can't say anything. I knew you'd come. I knew it. I knew it. I was a bit worried. I thought you might meet somebody else. Who? I said I'd wait and I meant it I never dreamed. How long are you going to stay? I don't know. A Day? A Week? I don't know. I'll come to see you whenever I can. I promise. See you in the morning. OK. - Good luck. - Thank you. I'm Curda. Mommy, he's here. Good evening and welcome. Thank you. My daughter, Jindriska. I'm Karel. Call me Aunt Marie. Everyone does. I'll show you to your room. Thank you. Oh... There's just one thing. My husband works on the railways and knows nothing of this. As far as he's concerned... you're from the country and looking for work in Prague, alright? My son, Ata. - Hello. - He studied at the conservatory. I'll get you something to eat. Thank you. Oh... When you wanna contact your friends, you tell me. - OK. - OK. There are eight streets leading off the square. Which one do you take if you want to go to Aunt Marie's? The one by the clock. And St. Nicholas Cathedral? The next one past the clock. Walk straight past. Don't look side ways. You've seen nothing. What's happening? I don't know but we mustn't stay... Heydrich! Come away please. You mustn't stand here. Josef. I think our fat one in Berlin will like this. Pick the best and put it on my train. I'll give him a little present when I go to Berlin. Berlin? The miners strike... Is it still on? Yes. Unfortunately Have six of them executed. That should put a stop to it. Frau Rostock, my best wishes. Lieutenant Rostock, congratulations. I have something special to show you. Follow me. Don't think this is your wedding present. These are the Crown Jewels. Made to the special order of Charles IV... by the finest craftsmen in Europe. Here, take it. Have a good look at it. Heavy isn't it? Try it on. There's a legend that says: "Any unrightful person who wears the crown... "will die within the year". - Herr Reich Protector. - Yes? There is something I'd like to ask you. Please... You mentioned in the church... I mean, are you planning to go to Berlin soon? Yes, very soon. I have some proposals to put to the F?hrer. He has agreed to my visit. Yes, it's all arranged. I see... Don't worry, Frank, I'll put in a good word for you. Thank you. Would you care to say a few words to the bride and groom? Well... If I have to. Ladies and Gentlemen. The Reich Protector wishes to address a few words to the happy couple. My dear friends. It gives me great pleasure. To propose a toast to the bride and groom. Two fine representatives of Germany's future. Lieutenant Rostock is a brave soldier... and his wife, Monika... is the prototype of the ideal German woman. Together, they will serve our F?hrer... and together, they will purify all Europe... in his glorious name. It's late, Ata. You should be asleep. I didn't realize, father. All well with you? As usual. Is Karel in? Yeah. Good night. You're very late, Carl. God, what a day. Panic from the moment I went on. You should have seen the chaos. Cattle trucks. The Germans want every single one. Cattle trucks. God knows why. On top of all that we got an order for Heydrich's special train. He's going to Berlin in three days. Heydrich. I knew it. I knew it was something important. I thought, perhaps the ?koda armaments works... Well? I don't know. I'm not sure. I'll have to think about it. Perhaps we should wait for the other parachutists to arrive. No. We can't take the risk. We have to do it the day he leaves for Berlin. It might be the only chance we get. Have you thought what they will do if you succeed in killing him? We have our orders. People who gave you those orders are safe in London. They don't have to suffer the reprisals. Think what they will do to this country. The world will come down on our heads. It's a chance we have to take. My God! They send us children. Do you imagine we didn't think of assassinating Heydrich? Why didn't you then? Because we know what the consequences will be. We are soldiers. This is a war. If you won't help us we'll do it alone. We never said we would not help you. What do you want us to do? Where is the best place to kill him? It's coming. And so... our beloved F?hrer takes time off from affairs of state to welcome to Berlin one of the men who is helping him in the glorious task of governing the Third Reich... SS ObergruppenF?hrer, Reinhard Heydrich... Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia. Reichskommissar Himmler watches as the presentations are made. The F?hrer and his two most trusted advisors are to meet in secret conference at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin before the F?hrer leaves for the ceremony at Berchtesgaden... to decorate our victorious generals who have brought honor and glory to the Third Reich and to the F?hrer. We should have stopped that other train. God, if only we could get accurate information. We'll have to send for those men from London now. Wireless operators to set up a communications network. All this time and energy and thought and for what? Killing. Christ... we're young. We should be out enjoying ourselves. If it was peace time suddenly... now. What would you do? I'd go out and buy a dress. A bright red dress made of silk. I'd see a good football match. Maybe get drunk afterwards. Parties, dancing! It's bad luck to be our age. Yes, bad luck. Oh, don't bother to iron the back. Nobody sees it. Dance with me? I... I don't know how to. You don't know how to dance? No. I never had the chance. Never? Shouldn't you be leaving? It's late. He's getting used to you. Excuse me, sir... A message from Berlin. Good news, I hope. See for yourself. - The whole of Europe? - Yes. Yes, it was my idea. The F?hrer has accepted it. I must go to Berlin immediately. May I be the first to congratulate you? Thanks. Well, Frank, you'll probably be my successor. Assuming, of course, that the F?hrer agrees. Of course... of course. Dear children... Thank you for your wonderful singing. Christmas is the time for children... and you are close to our hearts. For you are the future. The glorious future of a large and strong family which has as its head our F?hrer. This calls for a celebration. May I announce the news? A message has arrived from Berlin which I have been authorized to translate. "For the duration of war emergency "I hereby appoint you commissioner and protector "for all occupied territories in Europe. "Arrange your affairs in order to arrive in Berlin without delay". Adolf Hitler. - Thursday... Are you sure? - I'm sure. What's happening? Next Thursday. Doesn't give us much time. We must give us time. We'll use one or two of the new fellows. No. No. Curda is right. It's too dangerous. That's for us to decide. It's not for you to decide. There are too many Czech lives at stake. I'm gonna stop this. I'm gonna notify London. London's orders were perfectly clear. Kill Heydrich at all costs. We've been here weeks. Why should we think of something in four days? Perhaps it's because we've been looking for a safe way. Maybe we're going to have to risk everything. What do you mean, everything? Something we've been thinking about for some time. He rises at 7 AM. Breakfast, bathes and then he's dressed by his valet. 7:45 precisely, he usually says goodbye to his daughter, gets into his Mercedez, which is driven by a Chauffeur Klein. When the car proceeds down the drive... he is escorted by an armed troop carrier, one jeep and an armored car. The convoy travels fairly slowly, at about 40 miles per hour. The first part of the journey is through the country side. Tree lined roads and small villages, along a road specially constructed to take him into Prague. He enters the outskirts of Prague at this point here. Proceeds around the bend at Holesovickach junction. And then enters Hradcany castle at 8:05 AM precisely. And he's been doing the same thing every day without fail. It never varies. What do you think Jan? There's only one place. Here. We kill him there as he comes around Holesovickach junction. But he's heavily guarded all the time. He slows down. You're gonna stand there? Pointing your guns a few feet from Heydrich... in full view of his escort? We'll never get away with it. It's the only place. It's suicide. Faster... We're running very late. Yes, Herr Reich Protector. Faster! But sir... We'll lose the convoy. Do as you're told. Run! Right! You two! Pick him up, put him in the back of the baker's van. Come on! Be careful. Easy, easy. Bulovka hospital quickly. I said it was impossible, we should never even have tried. It's on the radio, he's still alive. They're offering a reward of ten million crowns. It jammed. I had him! I had him! Mommy, have you seen my bicycle? Oh Christ, I left it outside of Kinsles. Quickly Jindriska, get it and bring it back here. No, I must go. No, go alone Jindriska, it's safer. Hundreds of splinters from the grenade penetrated deeply into the lumbar region. We removed what we could, but his spleen and kidneys are seriously damaged. But much more dangerous is that fine splinters of horse hair... and material from the car upholstery have entered the blood stream. We may have to operate again. No, you are not to touch him. But Herr Frank? The F?hrer's own surgeons are coming. Keep him alive until then. But if blood poisoning sets in? Oh Father of mercy. We pray to thee for thy servant Reinhard Heydrich. We remember now, oh Lord, his qualities of leadership... his sense of service... the inspiration he has been to all the people. And we pray... that he may long continue to lead, to serve and to inspire. Amen. It is only these two? Oh... Sort of... What do you mean sort of? Is it or isn't it? How many will there be? Three... Four... Seven. - We must go. - Where's Curda? He should have been here hours ago. We'll have to leave without him. But we can't leave without Curda. The longer you stay here the more dangerous it is. You'll have to go. No, I'm sorry, we can't leave without him. Listen to Janak. It's too risky. Talk to him, make him see sense. No, I'm with Jan. Three of us landed together and we are gonna stay together. We wait. How long for God's sake? We'll give him... 12 hours? Now State Secretary Frank salutes. He has vowed to root out the criminals who are responsible for this cowardly crime. Anyone who assists them or fails to give information will be executed... ...they and their families, until justice is done. Now it is the turn of Frau Heydrich, Her face veiled, to kneel and kiss the flag. She steps back as the six officers take up their positions, either side of the gun carriage. The coffin is raised, the command is given. The escort comes to attention... and the sad procession makes its way towards the train. Karel. I've never asked you for anything, have I? Don't go now, please. No, I won't. I won't ever leave you. ...where he would be laid to rest in the presence of the F?hrer. Liditz. Liditz? Never heard of it. Liditz? You will. Muller! Liditz... 20 kilometers northwest of Prague. Lieutenant, you will command the attack. For translation. In the next news broadcast. "Communications Office of the acting Reich Protector. "In the course of the search for the murderers of Obergruppenf?hrer Heydrich, "it was found that the population of village of Liditz, "approximately 20 kilometers northwest of Prague, "had helped and cooperated with the perpetrators of this crime. "Accordingly a detachment of the SS division Prinz Eugen, "commanded by SS Obersturmf?hrer Max Roshnov Rostock, "was dispatched for Liditz at dawn. "All the man have been shot, "women deported to concentration camps, "the children sent to appropriate houses for re-education. "All the buildings of this village have been destroyed... "and the name of the village removed from the land register. "The village of Liditz has ceased to exist... "and it's name will never again appear on any map". Come. I'll take you to the others. Father, I want to confess. I confess Father, to murder. Mass murder. The people of Liditz. I am responsible. How were you responsible? I killed Heydrich. What happened to Liditz is because of that. You are wrong. By that reckoning, I am just as responsible. Simply for harboring you here. No, we're at war... War is the greatest evil. In war, no man can hold himself responsible for the sins of his enemy. But Father... I can't help but feel it. I'll give you a penance if it's a penance you want. Anything Father. Anything. Learn to forgive your enemy. Pray for them Jan. Pray for them... and for the souls of the departed. I absolve you in the name of the Father and of the Son... and of the Holy Ghost, amen. Hi, Josef. Hello. - Hello, Josef. - Hi. Isn't Curda with you? No. We couldn't wait any longer. I've got some information. Yeah? About the Reich Protector. Sit down over there. I got some cheese for you. Thank you. I'll give you one guess. Don't tell me. Don't tell me. - Yeah, sausages. - Sausages. Good news. Yeah, four aces. You'll be out of here in 24 hours. The R.A.F. is sending a plane, they've given us a map reference. Marvelous! You'll have to be out of here by day break. We'll make all the necessary arrangements. I want to ask a favor. I want to go out this afternoon, Janak. I need to meet Anna. It's only for an hour. Alright. Good. Have her meet me on the embankment of Charles Bridge at 2:30. Thank you. Ata, you better bring in some provisions tonight. OK. Yeah, and champagne and caviar. We'll have ourselves a bon voyage party. Come this way. Name? Karel Curda. Occupation? I'm a parachutist dropped by the R.A.F. I understand you wish to make a statement. Yes. You realize that whatever you tell us may not have the value you put on it. I am a member of the group that killed Heydrich... and I can identify the others. First you must give me an assurance. But before we make a... let's say bargains, we must find out what you know then we will see. Oh. Please sit down. Who are these men? Can you give us their names? Where they are hiding? Josef Gabcik, Jan Kubis. We were dropped together. Why are you telling us this? Is it for the reward? I want to protect my family. I don't want my wife and child shot, please. Do you think you could tell us which of these was found at the scene of the assassination? This one is Gabcik's. Carried his STEN gun in here. Where are these two men? I don't know. Hiding in Prague somewhere. You'll have to do better than that. Where are they? I don't know. Mr. Curda. How old is your child? Who is it? It's alright. I'll get it. Raise your hands. Turn and face the wall. What... What do you want? Where are they? What are you doing? Tell them to stop. I want to know where they are. Who? Who're you talking about? Kubis and Gabcik. The assassins. Where are they? Assassins... there's no one here. Only my wife. Just take me. My husband knows nothing about it. Hey Fleischer! I'm sorry. Mommy. Quickly, you must warn Ata. Go to the conservatoire. Tell him he must not go home. He's to go straight to the crypt... and you... Hurry up! What's the matter? I haven't any money for the tram. There. Mama! Jindriska! Papa! My love... Just tell me where they are. Why protect them? Why be so obstinate? You are a music student, I see. Ah yes, you play the violin. We're leaving at day break. I know. The war will be over someday. I'll be back. Stay with me. I can't. I'll hide you. You'll be safe. We'll leave Prague and go somewhere else. Anna, it's not possible. Why? Try and think of afterwards. That's what I do. When it's over I think of coming back. Seeing you again I wish I knew you better. I wish we had more time. You're right, we don't know each other at all. I know nothing about you, Anna. You don't even know my real name. It's not important. I never did get that red dress. No, I never saw a football match. Curda? So pleased to see you Curda. I... I didn't tell him... about the church... I didn't tell him. What church Ata? Saints Cyril, Resslova street. I... I didn't tell him. I didn't... I... I didn't tell him. Come back soon. Jan! What happened? My mother's... There's nothing for you here. Kubis. Lieutenant! - What's the matter? - They found us. The street is swarming with them. How did they find us? Who the hell talked? What difference does it make? Hundreds of them. I gotta warn the others. No, there isn't time. - Bahtz take cover. - Bubrich follow me. Father Petrek? Father Petrek? Give me a hand. The passage! Father Petrek thought it might lead to the river. At least this must go on to the street. That's ridiculous! Three men hold back a whole battalion? Impossible! But Herr Fleischer... No excuses! I don't care how you do it, but bring me those three bastards. Understand? They are re-grouping. Jesus Christ, those poor bastards up there. Alright, who are these men? Are these the assassins? No. Who are they then? Bach... Bubrich... and Korel. They were dropped after us. Where are the others? Search the church from top to bottom, but find them. Come on! It's our only chance. It's hopeless. The priest was wrong. There is no passage. What's going on here? We've searched everywhere except the crypt, but we can't find the entrance. There must be one somewhere. Get this matting up. Here it is. There must be another entrance. A window perhaps. There's probably a ventilator. What are you waiting for then? That must be a ventilator. Open fire on it. It's from the F?hrer. They must be taken alive. Tell them to surrender. Jan! Josef! Josef, give up! It's useless. Here! Here! I've found another entrance. It's cemented over. Blow it up! Josef, Jan! Listen! Jusech, help Josef go up the stairs. Go on! Josef! There must be five feet of water now. They haven't a chance. They must surrender. Right, we'll wait. How many you got? Enough. It's all over. Move on. Move on. It's all over.
