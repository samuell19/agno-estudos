WHATEVER. NO, I'M SERIOUS. HIS DAD USED TO HIT HIS MOM, AND HE NEVER THOUGHT HE COULD ACT LIKE THAT. I KNOW HE GETS INTENSE SOMETIMES, BUT IT'S ONLY BECAUSE HE LOVES ME SO MUCH. YOU CALL THAT LOVE? AND WHAT DO YOU CALL LOVE? GOING DOWN ON GUYS? KELLI. KELLI, I'M SORRY. I-I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. KELLI, HEY. YOU ALL RIGHT? K-- HEY. ARE YOU DITCHING? 'CAUSE I'LL DITCH WITH YOU. WE CAN GO HANG OUT AT THE LAKE. WHY, SO I CAN GO DOWN ON YOU, TOO? UH...NO. I DON'T THINK I KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH FOR THAT. OKAY. HEY, LIZZA-BETTY. READY FOR JUDGMENT DAY? NO. YEAH, ME EITHER. [ LAUGHS ] [ CHUCKLES ] SINCE WHEN DO YOU KNOW TY BENCHLEY? SINCE HE SITS BEHIND ME IN CHEMISTRY CLASS AND TRIES TO CHEAT OFF ME. AWW, IS SOMEBODY JEALOUS? DO I HAVE A REASON TO BE? NO. WHY ARE YOU LETTING GO OF MY HAND? BECAUSE THIS IS MY CLASS. WHY ARE YOU SUDDENLY ACTING ALL WEIRD? I'M JUST BEING A GUY. [ CHUCKLES ] OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU AFTER CLASS? [ BELL RINGS ] SO, WHO ARE YOUR PARADIGMS? "PARADIGMS." MM. GOOD WORD. ALANIS MORISSETTE. MM. THE RAMONES. MM. NORA JONES. DO YOU EVER THINK OF YOUR, UH, POETRY AS LYRICS? YEAH. I KNEW IT. CAN I READ WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WRITING? NO. [ CHUCKLES ] WELL, NOT NOW. BUT SOMEDAY. [ Laughing ] I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE. COOL. LOOK, I CAN'T SKIP THE WHOLE DAY, JUST TILL AFTER ENGLISH. I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE SEEING AUSTIN'S STUPID SMIRK. DID YOU NOT KNOW HE'S AN ASS, OR DO YOU JUST LIKE GUYS LIKE THAT? ALL GUYS ARE LIKE THAT. NOT ALL GUYS. WHATEVER. NOT ALL GUYS. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? I WANT YOU TO BELIEVE ME. WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHAT I THINK? BECAUSE... I LIKE YOU. [ LAUGHS ] LIAR. AND YOU, MISS JONES... IT CONCERNS ME TO SEE SUCH A DRASTIC DROP. I KNOW. I'M SORRY. IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. CAN I GO NOW, PLEASE? SOMEONE'S WAITING FOR ME. ALL RIGHT. JUST FOCUS, YOUNG LADY. [ GASPS ] NEXT TIME I'LL CAUSE A DISTRACTION. YOU JUST MAKE A RUN FOR IT. [ LAUGHS ] MARK! YOU LEFT ME SITTING IN THE QUAD WITH MY THUMB UP MY ASS WHILE YOU'RE IN THERE MESSING AROUND WITH TY BENCHLEY. MS. EDMONDS MADE US STAY LATE AFTER CLASS. I SAW YOU! I KNOW YOU'RE INTO HIM! I KNOW THAT SMILE YOU GET! I WASN'T FLIRTING WITH HIM! I SWEAR! MARK, PLEASE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? JUST LISTEN TO ME, PLEASE. [ GRUNTS ] [ GASPING ] [ LAUGHS ] YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN. LIZZY, OH, MY GOD. ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH, I'M FINE. YOUR FACE IS COVERED IN BLOOD. HEY. WHAT HAPPENED? MARK HIT HER? MM-HMM. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. I'D LIKE TO CALL THE POLICE, BUT ELIZABETH IS DENYING SHE WAS HIT. SHE'S INSISTING SHE TRIPPED. [ GASPS ] I FELL. KELLI'S LYING. OKAY? SHE HATES MARK. HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA KEEP DENYING IT? I-I FELL! I TRIPPED OVER THE CURB! I -- YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR! OR WHAT? TELL ME YOU DID THAT TO YOUR FACE BY FALLING! MOM, WHERE -- MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU WEREN'T IN A CAR ACCIDENT THE OTHER NIGHT. HE HIT YOU, DIDN'T HE? NO, NO. KELLI SAID SHE SAW HIM CRAWLING OUT OF THE WINDOW. HE WAS HERE THAT NIGHT, WASN'T HE? YOU HAVE BEEN LYING, AND YOU HAVE BEEN SNEAKING AROUND TO PROTECT WHAT? A BOY WHO HITS YOU?! [ BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY ] "SORRY." WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO BE SORRY FOR, ELIZABETH? YOU ARE NEVER, EVER SEEING THAT BOY AGAIN. DO YOU HEAR ME? [ Voice breaking ] YOU DON'T GET IT, OKAY? I LOVE HIM. I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HIM. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE HIM. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?! HE HIT YOU! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, OKAY?! IT WAS MY FAULT! [ CRYING ] YOU GET THAT THOUGHT OUT OF YOUR HEAD. DO YOU HEAR ME?! [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] OH, MY... AUNT MARIE, IT'S KELLI. MARIE: Hi, honey. I WAS JUST CALLING TO SEE HOW ELIZABETH IS DOING. UH, THE DOCTOR SAYS SHE'S GONNA BE FINE PHYSICALLY. IS SHE MAD AT ME? No. CAN I TALK TO HER? YOU KNOW, KELLI, THIS JUST REALLY ISN'T A VERY GOOD TIME. OKAY. I UNDERSTAND. HONEY, THANKS FOR CALLING... AND FOR HELPING LIZZY AT SCHOOL. [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] SHE SAID IT WASN'T A GOOD TIME. IT'S GOOD YOU CALLED. I SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING EARLIER. ABOUT MARK? YOU DID. YOU SAID SOMETHING TO ME. NO, THAT WAS BEFORE. I FOUND OUT THE TRUTH LATER, AND I STARTED TO TELL AUNT MARIE, BUT THEN I DIDN'T. OH, KELLI. LIZZY BEGGED ME NOT TO. BUT THEN I SAW HER IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL, [ Voice breaking ] AND HER FACE WAS COVERED IN BLOOD. OH... SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW SHE WAS BLEEDING. [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] TALK TO ME. SHE JUST LOOKED... SO...LOST. AND -- AND I KNOW JUST HOW SHE FEELS. I DO THINGS. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I DO THEM. I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE THAT ANYMORE. [ Crying ] I DON'T WANT TO MESS UP MY LIFE. I DON'T WANT TO BE LOST. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] [ SIGHS ] IF SHE WON'T ADMIT IT, IF SHE'S NOT GONNA PRESS CHARGES, I'M GOING OVER THERE. AND DO WHAT? HIS FATHER WILL CALL THE POLICE. HE'LL HAVE YOU ARRESTED. WELL, THEN, WE HAVE GOT TO MOVE HER TO A DIFFERENT SCHOOL. I DON'T THINK TAKING HER AWAY FROM ALL HER FRIENDS IS A GOOD IDEA RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS A GOOD IDEA, MARIA? I'D REALLY LIKE TO KNOW. YOU'RE THE LAWYER. CAN WE HIT HIM WITH A CIVIL SUIT? NO. NOT IF SHE WON'T PRESS CHARGES. [ SCOFFS ] I THINK WE HAVE TO GET HER TO A THERAPIST IF SHE'LL AGREE TO GO. OH, SHE'LL GO IF I HAVE TO PICK HER UP AND PUT HER IN THE CAR MYSELF. [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] IS IT MARK? HER PHONE'S BEEN RINGING NONSTOP. [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] MARK, YOU CALL HERE ONE MORE TIME, I'M COMING OVER THERE! I'M GONNA RIP YOUR DAMN HEAD OFF! DO YOU UNDERSTAND?! [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] [ CLATTER ] HEY, KELLI. IS YOUR COUSIN OKAY? YEAH. I THINK SO. I'M SORRY FOR BEING SO WEIRD YESTERDAY, ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT YOU SAID. IT WASN'T, UH, EASY TO SAY IT. I'M SHY. [ CHUCKLES ] YOU'RE NOT SHY. WELL, YOU EMBOLDEN ME. EMBOLDEN? IS THAT EVEN A WORD? YOU'RE, LIKE, THE SMARTEST, COOLEST CHICK IN SCHOOL. YOU SAY STUFF LIKE THAT, YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME THINK YOU'RE FULL OF IT. WELL, MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T SEE IT. I-I JUST DON'T THINK I'M READY TO LIKE SOMEONE BACK YET. IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T LIKE YOU. IT'S -- IT'S JUST THAT -- NO. HEY. I GET IT. I GET IT. Mark: HEY, KELLI. I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT ELIZABETH. DID SHE COME TO SCHOOL TODAY? WHY WOULD I TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT ELIZABETH? SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND. I'M THE ONE THAT FOUND HER IN THE PARKING LOT BLEEDING AFTER YOU BASHED IN HER FACE. SO, YOU'RE GONNA START DISSING ME AGAIN? HEY. JUST STAY AWAY FROM HER. EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT YOU DID, MAN! WHAT ARE YOU FEELING RIGHT NOW, ELIZABETH? I'M TIRED. I HAD A HARD TIME SLEEPING LAST NIGHT. YOU MAY FEEL OUT OF SORTS FOR A WHILE. POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS IS COMMON AFTER BEING IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. [ SCOFFS ] I'M NOT IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. WE HAD A COUPLE BAD FIGHTS, WHICH WERE MOSTLY MY FAULT. MARK LOVES ME. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? 'CAUSE HE SAYS IT? NO, BECAUSE HE FEELS IT. AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT MARK HAS THAT FEELING? [ CHUCKLES ] HE KISSES ME. HE TELLS ME I'M BEAUTIFUL. HE WAITS FOR ME EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL AND -- AND DRIVES ME HOME, GETS ME PRESENTS. SO, YOU KNOW HE LOVES YOU BY THE WAY HE ACTS TOWARDS YOU? YES. WHAT DOES IT SAY WHEN HE HITS YOU? YOU KNEW THAT MARK HIT HER BEFORE? WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU KEEP A SECRET LIKE THAT? SHE SAID IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN AND THAT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME. AND YOU DIDN'T WHEN I TOLD YOU MARK CLIMBED OUT THE WINDOW. OH, MY GOD. I ONLY HEARD WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR. [ SIGHS ] I KEPT THINKING YOU'D CALL ME LAST NIGHT. WHY? SO YOU COULD GLOAT BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER TURNED OUT TO BE EVEN MORE SCREWED UP THAN YOURS? OH, MY -- YOU KNOW, SHE STOPPED SPENDING TIME WITH HER FRIENDS. SHE WOULD GET SO ANXIOUS WHEN SHE COULDN'T TEXT HIM BACK RIGHT AWAY. I MEAN, I'M HER MOTHER! I NEVER SUSPECTED ANYTHING! I LEFT HER VULNERABLE TO THAT MONSTER. OH, MY GOD. I DIDN'T PROTECT HER. [ SIGHS ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] WHOA. DOES IT HURT AS BAD AS IT LOOKS? [ SIGHS ] DOES IT REALLY LOOK THAT BAD? YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED IN THE MIRROR? YOU THINK I DESERVE IT, DON'T YOU, FOR STAYING WITH HIM? I KNOW WHY YOU STAYED WITH HIM. BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM. AT LEAST YOU HAD THAT. MY PARENTS THINK I SHOULD BREAK UP WITH HIM. THEY DON'T THINK HE CAN CHANGE. AND YOU DO? HE LOVES ME. [ SCOFFS ] I KNOW YOU DON'T GET IT, BUT WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEONE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY DO. YOU KNOW WHY THEY DID IT, AND YOU CAN FORGIVE THEM FOR IT. OKAY. SO FORGIVE HIM. JUST DON'T BE WITH HIM. DON'T KEEP GETTING BEAT UP. HE WOULDN'T DO THAT ANYMORE. LOOK IN THE MIRROR. JUST LOOK. [ INHALES SHARPLY ] [ SIGHS ] HOW'S WALT HANDLING IT? HE'S HOLDING EVERYTHING IN. IT'S LIKE HE'S READY TO EXPLODE. ALL I KNOW IS THAT ELIZABETH IS NOT LEAVING THIS HOUSE UNTIL SHE BREAKS UP WITH THAT BOY. ARE YOU SURE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GO? SHE'LL RESENT YOU FOR IT. IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT A GIRL DOESN'T NEED HER MOTHER TO BE HER BUDDY. CHILDREN NEED A PARENT WHO'S WILLING TO LAY DOWN THE RULES. CAN I HAVE MY PHONE, PLEASE? I'M READY TO DO IT -- READY TO BREAK UP WITH MARK. [ MARIE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] IT'S ALL RIGHT. OKAY? [ SIGHS ] SO? WELL, HE DIDN'T MAKE IT EASY FOR HER. IT WAS...AWFUL. HE JUST KEPT CRYING AND CRYING. [ SIGHS ] HE'S JUST TRYING TO WORK YOU. HE'S A MANIPULATOR. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? YOU HAD TO END THIS, LIZZY. IT COULD NOT GO ON. HE'S NOT WORTH YOUR TEARS, LIZZY. CAN I JUST GO TO BED? I'M...REALLY TIRED. OF COURSE. [ SNIFFLES ] YOU DID THE RIGHT THING, SWEETHEART. [ SIGHS ] DID THEY BUY IT? [ CHUCKLES ] I CAN'T LET YOU GO. I JUST... I CAN'T. [ CHUCKLES ] SWEETHEART. OH, THANKS. HOW DO I LOOK? YOU LOOK VERY NICE. YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL SO SOON, SWEETHEART. IT'S JUST BEEN A COUPLE OF DAYS. NO. I THINK SHE WANTS TO GET THINGS BACK TO NORMAL. HE'LL BE THERE. I KNOW. YOU KNOW, HE WOULDN'T BE THERE IF YOU'D JUST ADMIT TO THE PRINCIPAL WHAT HE DID, AND THEN SHE COULD PRESS CHARGES, AND -- DAD, I'VE ALREADY HURT HIM BAD ENOUGH, OKAY? I'M NOT RUINING HIS LIFE. YOU'VE HURT HIM? ELIZABETH! I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE GONNA BE MAD AT ME, BUT I DON'T CARE. I'M NOT SENDING MARK TO JAIL. THE THERAPIST SAID YOU HAVE TO RESPECT MY WISHES. Kelli: LIZZY! HEY! HEY. YOU LOOK GREAT. DO YOU WANT ME TO WALK IN WITH YOU? YEAH. DOES, UH, EVERYONE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? [ SIGHS ] LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT YESTERDAY. [ SIGHS ] LEAVE HER ALONE! DON'T YELL AT HIM LIKE THAT. WHY SHOULDN'T I YELL AT HIM? AFTER WHAT HE DID TO YOU? IT'S JUST -- IF I'D BEEN A BETTER GIRLFRIEND, MAYBE HE WOULDN'T HAVE LOST IT. YOU KNOW? [ SIGHS ] NEVER MIND. I BRING MY DAUGHTER TO YOU FOR HELP, AND YOU COMPLETELY UNDERMINE MY PARENTAL AUTHORITY! I-I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T -- YOU TOLD HER THAT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO MAKE HER BREAK UP WITH A BOY WHO ASSAULTED HER?! I SAID THAT PARENTS HAVE NO AUTHORITY OVER WHO THEIR CHILD CARES FOR. THAT'S RIDICULOUS! DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO PROTECT ELIZABETH, BUT...GETTING OUT OF AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP IS DANGEROUS AND DIFFICULT. JUST BECAUSE A GIRL SAYS IT'S OVER DOESN'T MEAN IT'S OVER. THANKS. [ CELLPHONE BEEPS, CLATTERS ] AWW. MARK'S LOOKING AT YOU WITH THOSE PUPPY-DOG EYES. YOU REALLY CAN'T FORGIVE HIM? LAINIE, LOOK AT HER FACE. YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T DO SOMETHING TO MAKE HIM SO MAD? IT TAKES TWO TO FIGHT, RIGHT? WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM? PEOPLE ON FACEBOOK ARE ALL "FORGIVE AND FORGET." IF YOU EVER THINK ABOUT FORGIVING HIM, I WILL NEVER SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN. DID YOU SEE WHERE MARK WENT? [ VEHICLE DEPARTS ] IF PEOPLE KNEW WE WERE STILL TOGETHER... [SCOFFS] THEY WOULDN'T GET IT. I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY ELSE THINKS. AS LONG AS I STILL HAVE YOU, THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU... SO MUCH, IT HURTS. [ CHUCKLES ] NOTHING CAN KEEP US APART, OKAY? NOTHING. THIS IS A FIRST -- YOU COMING TO ME FOR ADVICE. THIS THERAPIST THREW ME FOR A LOOP. SHE SAID THAT IF I DON'T ACCEPT ELIZABETH'S LOVE FOR MARK, THEN I'M PRACTICALLY PUSHING THE TWO OF THEM BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. YOU CAN ACCEPT HOW SHE FEELS WITHOUT LETTING HER STAY WITH HIM. I'M SUPPOSED TO ACCEPT MY ONLY DAUGHTER'S LOVE FOR A BOY WHO BEATS HER? EVERY BONE IN MY BODY IS TELLING ME TO STAMP THIS THING OUT. JUST LIKE EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY TOLD YOU KELLI'S FATHER WAS GONNA RUIN MY LIFE? WELL, YEAH. IF YOU HAD LISTENED TO ME, YOU WOULD -- I DID LISTEN TO YOU, MARIE. THAT WAS THE PROBLEM. YOU MADE ME FEEL SO STUPID FOR LOVING HIM THAT I STARTED THINKING HE WAS THE ONLY ONE ON MY SIDE. YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S MY FAULT THAT YOU MARRIED THAT LOSER? NO, BUT... I JUST WISH YOU'D SAID, YOU KNOW, JUST ONCE, "I GET THAT YOU LOVE HIM. "YOU'RE NOT STUPID FOR LOVING HIM, BUT DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE TREATED THAT WAY?" WELL, I NEVER THOUGHT THAT... [ SCOFFS ] I NEVER REALIZED THAT. I DON'T THINK YOU DO REALIZE HOW YOU COME OFF. YOU'RE SO STRONG AND SO SURE OF YOURSELF, WHICH IS GREAT MOST OF THE TIME, BUT SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE YOU EXPECT EVERYBODY TO FEEL EXACTLY THE WAY YOU FEEL AND TO DO THE THINGS YOU WANT THEM TO DO. I THINK THAT THERAPIST WAS RIGHT. IF YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ELIZABETH AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW SHE FEELS, YOU'RE GONNA PUT A WALL UP BETWEEN YOU, AND SHE'S GONNA BE ALL ALONE ON THE OTHER SIDE -- WITH MARK. [ SIGHS ] YOU GO IN THE SOUTH ENTRANCE, OKAY? HEY. DON'T FORGET TO KEEP YOUR PHONE ON. YEAH. OKAY. LIZZY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [ SCOFFS ] LOOK, IF I WANT TO TALK TO MARK, IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS, OKAY? OH, BUT YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT. YOU'LL PROBABLY BE RATTING ON ME ANYWAYS, RIGHT? IT TOOK ME HALF A DAY TO FIGURE OUT YOU GUYS ARE STILL TOGETHER. YOUR PARENTS AREN'T DUMB. THEY'LL FIGURE IT OUT, TOO. THERE'S NOTHING TO FIGURE OUT, OKAY? ME AND MARK ARE STILL BROKEN UP. HE WAS JUST REALLY UPSET, SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE HE WAS OKAY. IS THAT TRUE? YEAH. [ BELL RINGS ] HEY. I'VE BEEN TEXTING YOU. WHY HAVEN'T YOU ANSWERED? WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE OUR PHONES ON IN CLASS. SO LEAVE IT ON SILENT. I DON'T WANT KELLI TO SEE US TALKING. SHE KNOWS I LEFT EARLIER WITH YOU, AND -- I'M GONNA TALK TO HER. NO, DON'T. JUST -- JUST LEAVE HER ALONE. THEN YOU TELL HER SHE NEEDS TO LEAVE US ALONE OR ELSE I'M GONNA HAVE TO TEACH HER A LESSON. DON'T DO THAT, OKAY? DON'T THREATEN MY COUSIN. I'M SERIOUS. LEAVE HER ALONE. SHH. SHH. CHILL. I WAS JUST -- THAT'S JUST A FIGURE OF SPEECH. I WAS JUST KIDDING. YOU OKAY? YOU SEEM KIND OF TENSE. THERE'S THIS THING ON THE INTERNET, AND PEOPLE ARE JUST -- YEAH, I KNOW. PEOPLE ARE SAYING ALL KINDS OF STUPID STUFF, BUT WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT, RIGHT? I GOT TO GO. MY MOM'S WAITING FOR ME. HEY! I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. OKAY, SO PROVE IT. LEAVE YOUR PHONE ON. OKAY. HI. ARE YOU OKAY? DID SOMETHING HAPPEN? YES. NO. I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS JUST HARD. DID MARK GIVE YOU A HARD TIME? NO, NO. I BARELY SAW HIM. WAS IT THE OTHER KIDS? YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR THERAPIST THIS AFTERNOON, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO. WHY WOULD YOU THINK I DON'T WANT TO GO? I DON'T WANT TO FORCE YOU TO DO ANYTHING THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME THINGS THAT YOU THINK I WANT TO HEAR. I'M READY TO LISTEN... IF YOU WANT TO TALK. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] THIS IS MY DAY FOR SURPRISE VISITORS. HOW'D YOU GET HERE? WE TOOK THE BUS. "WE"? [ LAUGHS ] THAT'S CODY. HE DIDN'T WANT ME CROSSING TOWN ALONE. I'M CONSIDERING HIM FOR A BOYFRIEND. CONSIDERING? WELL, THE WHOLE BOY/GIRL THING'S REALLY CONFUSING. [ SIGHS ] TELL ME ABOUT IT. AND? [ SIGHS ] LIZZY'S GONNA HATE ME FOR THIS. SHE LIED ABOUT BREAKING UP WITH MARK. THEY'RE STILL TOGETHER. Woman: HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING SINCE YOUR BREAKUP? A LOT OF GIRLS TELL ME THEY CAN'T STOP CRYING. EVEN WHEN THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A RELIEF TO BREAK UP WITH THEIR ABUSER, THEY STILL FEEL SAD. HAVE YOU BEEN SAD? I GUESS. HAS MARK BEEN TRYING TO CONTACT YOU, TALK YOU INTO TAKING HIM BACK? [ CLEARS THROAT ] NO, NOT REALLY. OKAY. RATHER THAN ME TRYING TO FORCE YOU TO TALK WHEN YOU CLEARLY DON'T FEEL LIKE TALKING... I NEVER SAID THAT. ...I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A LITTLE ASSIGNMENT, AND THEN WE CAN CALL IT A DAY. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK UP A WEBSITE AND READ ME A FEW THINGS, AND THEN YOU CAN GO. THAT'S IT? JUST, UH, SEARCH THE PHRASE "SIGNS YOU'RE BEING ABUSED" AND TELL ME WHAT COMES UP. I ALREADY BROKE UP WITH MARK. THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? FINE. I'LL READ IT. AND THEN I GET TO GO, RIGHT? [ CLEARS THROAT ] "DOES YOUR BOYFRIEND ACT IN WAYS THAT SCARE YOU? "DOES HE ACT JEALOUS OR POSSESSIVE? "DOES HE TRY TO CONTROL WHERE YOU GO "OR NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AT ALL TIMES? "DOES HE CHECK YOUR E-MAIL, "YOUR PHONE MESSAGES, OR TEXTS? "DOES HE TELL YOU WHAT TO WEAR OR MAKE YOU CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES?" [ CHUCKLES ] "DOES HE CALL YOU OR TEXT YOU EXCESSIVELY "OR INSIST THAT YOU ANSWER HIS CALLS WITHIN A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME?" [ CHUCKLES ] "DOES HE SHOVE, H-HIT, OR KICK YOU?" [ CLEARS THROAT ] JUST ONE MORE. THEN YOU'RE DONE. [ SCOFFS ] "DOES HE BLAME YOU FOR THE HURTFUL THINGS HE SAYS OR DOES?" [ CLEARS THROAT ] IS KELLI SURE? OKAY, WELL, THANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW. TALK TO YOU SOON. [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] [ SIGHS ] I FEEL BAD FOR RATTING HER OUT. BUT THEN I FELT BAD WHEN I KNEW AND I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE. I THINK YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. YOUR MOM SEEMS COOL. SHE IS. SO ARE YOU. IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE, THAT WAS ME TELLING YOU THAT I LIKE YOU. WELL, HOW COULD I MISS IT, THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ME AROUND? [ Laughing ] WHO'S BEEN FOLLOWING WHO? [ CELLPHONE RINGING ] SO, THE WHOLE THING WAS A SHAM? WELL, I'M GONNA GO LAY DOWN THE LAW WITH HER RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU TRIED THAT ALREADY. IT DIDN'T WORK. IT MADE HER LIE TO US. SO, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO -- LOCK HER IN HER ROOM UNTIL SHE'S 18? THEN WHAT? I DON'T KNOW. WE'RE HER PARENTS, MARIE. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT HER. BUT WE CAN'T SAVE HER. SHE HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT FOR HERSELF. [ CELLPHONE RINGS, VIBRATES ] [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] HELLO? I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU! I'VE BEEN TEXTING YOU! WHY HAVEN'T YOU ANSWERED? MY PARENTS HAVE BEEN AROUND ME ALL NIGHT. Okay. Okay. Okay. C-Can you sneak out and meet me? [ SIGHS ] I DON'T THINK SO. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE WITH ME, YOU'LL FIND A WAY. I HAVE A LOT OF HOMEWORK THAT I NEED TO DO. AND THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN ME? NO. I GOT TO GO. MY DAD'S COMING. W-Wait. Uh, um -- [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] ELIZABETH... [SIGHS] YOU AND I ARE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE TALK. I'M REALLY TIRED. CAN WE DO IT TOMORROW? THIS CAN'T WAIT TILL TOMORROW. I THINK IT CAN WAIT. SHE'S EXHAUSTED. THANK YOU. [ CELLPHONE DIALING ] I'M CALLING YOU RIGHT NOW. WHERE'S YOUR PHONE? I ASKED YOU A QUESTION. MARK, I'M BREAKING UP WITH YOU. ARE YOUR PARENTS LISTENING? [ SIGHS ] NO. I'M SERIOUS. I'M BREAKING UP WITH YOU. IT'S OVER. BUT YOU LOVE ME. [ Voice breaking ] I KNOW. BUT I'M STILL BREAKING UP WITH YOU. WHY? BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE SCARED ANYMORE. WHY ARE YOU SCARED? I HAVEN'T HIT YOU AGAIN. IT'S NOT JUST THAT. YOU CALL ME CONSTANTLY. YOU TRY TO CONTROL WHERE I GO. WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM? IT DOESN'T MATTER. I'M STILL BREAKING UP WITH YOU. YEAH, WELL, IF YOU DO, I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF. I SWEAR TO GOD, I WILL. DON'T SAY THAT. [ Voice breaking ] I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU. SO I'M GONNA HOLD ON TO YOU UNTIL YOU TAKE ME BACK. LET GO. NO. I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU. I'M GONNA HOLD ON TO YOU UNTIL YOU TAKE ME BACK. LET GO OF ME! SHH! JUST BE QUIET. YOUR PARENTS ARE GONNA HEAR YOU. GOOD! MOM, DAD, HE'S HERE! [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] IF YOU COME ANYWHERE NEAR THIS HOUSE AGAIN, I'LL BREAK EVERY BONE IN YOUR DAMN BODY! WHAT HAPPENED? SHE'S STILL SEEING HIM. NO, I'M NOT. I SWEAR. I ACTUALLY BROKE UP WITH HIM FOR REAL THIS TIME. YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME. You have to believe me. OKAY. [ BREATHES SHAKILY ] OKAY. [ CRYING ] OKAY. SHE'S SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HER BED IN A DAZE. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US SLEPT ALL NIGHT. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, MARIE. WE HAVE GOT TO GET A RESTRAINING ORDER. HONEY, SHE DOESN'T WANT TO PRESS CHARGES. IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE UNLESS IT'S HER CHOICE. THE THERAPIST SAID WE HAVE TO SUPPORT OUR DAUGHTER. WHAT IS IT, HONEY? WHAT? OH, MY GOD.
