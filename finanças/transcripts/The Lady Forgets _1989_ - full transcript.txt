(MultiCom Jingle) (metal clanging) (lively jazz music) (junkie breathing heavily) (mysterious music) - Thanks a lot. - [Doorman] Goodbye. (suspenseful music) (Rebecca grunts) (head thuds) (suspenseful music) - [Woman] Help her! - Do something! (people chattering) What on earth, do something. - Damn junkies. You all right, lady? (Rebecca groans) Lady, are you all right? Okay, you just sit tight. There will be an ambulance here in no time. - Oh, I don't, I, I don't need an ambulance. I just slipped. - Slipped, come on, lady, I saw it, but you don't wanna take the time to file a complaint, right? - Complaint, no, really, I'm fine. - Yeah, sure. What's the matter, none of you got any place to be? Here are your things. - Oh, that's not mine. - If it ain't yours, what the hell was it doing in your purse? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Lady, in case you decide to sue somebody, I'm gonna need a name and an address. - Yes, of course, Rebecca Simms, 2489 Walnut, Valley Green. (mysterious music) - Damn it. (suspenseful music) (mysterious music) - You and Betty Friedan would do the same for me, right? (mysterious music) (dog barking) (mysterious music) (doorbell ringing) (mysterious music) - Julie, I love you, T.C. I forgot to leave the key under the mat again. No hug, no kiss, no nothing? (suspenseful music) Priscilla? - Andrew! - What happened to your hair? - [Priscilla] Andrew! (mysterious music) - Rebecca? - I thought we agreed to discuss things around here for a change. - Rebecca. - Why is there a new car that we never even talked about sitting out there in the driveway? - After all this time. Your clothes, your hair. - I'm sorry I'm late, but I told you this morning, right before I left that I was going to the museum, and I would be home late. Did I tell you that or not? - Oh yeah, you told me that all right. - Well then, I don't understand why you're upset. - Two years ago! - You're not making any sense. - Now, I'm not making any sense. I mean, maybe this wasn't the worlds most terrific marriage, but I never believed you'd walk out on your own child. Not once in those two years did you even call her. - That's ridiculous. Priscilla, Priscilla, did I give you $2.00 for lunch money this morning or not? - Not even a birthday card. (mysterious music) - Mother. - [Operator] We're sorry, you have reached a number that is no longer in service. If you feel you have reached this number in error, please redial or check your directory. - Your mother moved to Glenn Falls. - [Operator] We're sorry, you have reached a number that is no longer in service. If you feel you have reached this number in error, please. - She would've told me. (mysterious music) - She didn't know where you were. Rebecca, I'm, I'm glad you're okay, but, look, why don't you go in, throw some water on your face. I'll get your coat. (mysterious music) (Rebecca screaming) (glass crashing) (mysterious music) - Priscilla? (mysterious music) - The doctor gave you something to sleep. He asked me how you got that bruise on the side of head. I said I didn't know. - I uh, tripped or something on the sidewalk walking from school. - Ah, you haven't been here or Saint Anne's in over two years. - That's not true. - No, what do suppose something like this costs, 10, 15 thousand? - None of that's mine. - Who's Julia, Rebecca, who's T.C.? - I don't know? - And who spent a month at the Empress Hotel? - I don't know. - The first week you were gone was the worst. I mean, the police wouldn't do a damn thing. I looked everywhere, hospitals, the morgue. Why couldn't you have at least told me you were going, and what do you suppose it did to your daughter, Rebecca? The Valley Green cop, the one that took the missing persons report, said to me, "You better face it pal, "for every missing woman we find murdered, "a hundred just walked off with some guy." And I was too stupid to believe it. Don't be here when I get home tomorrow, Rebecca. (light piano music) (Rebecca sighs) - Priscilla, Priscilla. (Rebecca sighs) (light piano music) (train rumbling) - [Man] Oh yeah, all right, go ahead. (light piano music) (moves into suspenseful music) - Obviously, it caused us no small amount of concern. Not to mention some inconvenience. - My last day at Saint Anne's, the date. - May 11th. - Yes, of course, we made Mother's Day cards last week. - Two years ago, Mrs. Simms. I'm afraid you didn't leave a forwarding address either. I'd like to be of more help. - You said there was a teaching position open. - [Sister] Yes. - I'd like my job back. I'm a good teacher. - Yes, you were, but under the circumstances, I'm afraid the Monsignor. Maybe there is something I can do. Let me call Dr. Bennett. I'm sure you remember him from the school board. - The psychiatrist? - I could set up and appointment if you'd like. (light piano music) (fence rattling) (suspenseful music) (horn blowing) - [Man] Hey, watch it! (suspenseful music) (cash registers beeping) (suspenseful music) - It is you! - [Woman] Hey, ow! (suspenseful music) (horn blowing) (tires screeching) - [Cabbie] Lady, what're you doing? - Go! - Hold it, hold it! Hey, stop, damn it! I said stop or I'll shoot! (glass crashing) (horn blowing) (door thuds) - I'm sorry, I didn't have any place to go. - This really isn't a good time. I'm about to go and bid on a landscaping job, and it's gonna take me a couple of days just to-- - This is gonna sound crazy, but I uh, some man followed me. He had a gun and I think he wanted to kill me. - Why are you telling me this? So you can come back? Please, don't, I finally got my life started again, Rebecca, and it just doesn't include you anymore. - Do you understand? He followed me to Saint Anne's. For all I know he could come here. - Except you don't live here anymore. I got a sitter coming in a few minutes. Now, I really don't have time for this. Just put the stuff in the car, okay? I suggest you go back to wherever it is you've been for the past two years. Maybe they can help you. - Why can't she stay until you get back? - Because she doesn't belong here anymore, that's why. - She's still my child. - A court might find that debatable. I'll cancel the sitter. Go on, honey, upstairs. I'll see you later. But be here when I get back, Rebecca, because there are a few things we gotta talk about. One of them being a divorce. (door thuds) - Thank you, baby. It's getting late. Aren't you tired? Do you like her? - She's okay, I guess. Didn't you remember anything? - No. - Not even living here? - No. - Not even me? I got school tomorrow. - I love you. (mysterious music) (Rebecca moaning) (woman gasping) (Rebecca gasping) (mysterious music) (Rebecca screams) (Rebecca gasping) (suspenseful music) (Rebecca gasps) (suspenseful music) (telephone ringing) (suspenseful music) Priscilla, wake up, honey, get up. Honey, somebody's trying to break into the house. We have to get out. Put your jeans on. (window crashing) (suspenseful music) (train rumbling) All right, you stay right here. Glenn Falls, Mrs. Jarman, J-A-R-M-A-N. No, I don't know what street. Oh, thank God. I was afraid you'd still be out of town. It's me, Rebecca. Momma, I don't have time to explain. Please, just listen to me. (train rumbling) Honey, I'm only doing this because I'm afraid for you. - But, why didn't you call the police? - There was something wrong with the phone. - Not that one. - Here, her grandmother's coming to meet her at Glenn Falls. Take care of her, please. Priscilla, Priscilla, Priscilla, I'll come to see you. I promise I will, Priscilla, honey. - When you told your husband you were going to be late that night, do you remember why? - I was going to the Civic Museum of Modern Art to see a painting. - Did you go there often? - Yes, I took art classes, but this was different. Someone had donated a painting. It was private. - You were invited? - No. - How did you plan to get in? - The guard who lets me in the nights I take classes. - Just relax, let yourself drift back. See if you can remember walking up to the front door. - Yes, I can see the guard inside. He doesn't want to let me in though. He's sorry, he promised, but he's afraid someone will find out. No, he's going to let me in, but I have to hurry so he won't get fired. - [Dr. Bennett] Did you see the painting? - Yes, but only for a moment. (mysterious music) People were coming. Mm, there's a door and then a hallway. The door's open, I can see a light. Voices, people are talking. No, they're arguing. - [Dr. Bennett] Do you know them? - No, I never saw them. Oh, oh, oh. (vase crashing) (Rebecca groaning) - One, two (fingers snap). What happened, do you know? - Something was broken (exhales deeply). - Mrs. Simms, you were a widow with a small child when you met your current husband, weren't you? - Yes. - How would you characterize your second marriage prior to that evening? - Difficult. - Mrs. Simms, they're are different kinds of amnesia. They can be physiological. An illness, for instance, or a blow to the head. It can also be psychological. A way of escaping something that we find painful. You see, Mrs. Simms, it's quite possible that the only thing waiting for you at the end of that long hallway was simply the painful reality that your marriage was not going to work. Maybe that's what was breaking, Mrs. Simms. - In uh, gallery three. - [Rebecca] Hi, I was afraid you wouldn't remember me. - I uh, I remember. - Could I uh, talk to you, please? - I got a break coming up. Maybe you wanna take a look at the Massey Van Gogh for a few minutes. - Sure. (mysterious music) - [Guard] What does she look like? - Guard, be advised, she's got blond hair and dark coat. I'll check in here. - [Guard] Yeah, I'll check the north entrance. (mysterious music) Hey, stop her! Hey, lady! (suspenseful music) Hey, hey, stop, stop her! (suspenseful music) (siren wailing) (Rebecca crying) - Hastings? - [Driver] Yeah, this goes to Hastings. (sirens wailing) (light jazz music) - Could you help me? Have you ever seen this before? Well, you have to keep a register or something, don't you? - So. - Wouldn't it tell who rented that room? - This is almost two years old, lady. - You want money? - Room 202, Julie Black. - Are you sure that's the right name? - Lady, nobody uses the right name in this dump. - Have I ever been here? - Yeah, I could've seen ya before. Then again, another 20 bucks. Have it either way. - Could I see it? The room I mean. - For $35.00, you can do anything you want in it, lady. (mysterious music) (woman gasps) (Rebecca breathing heavily) (glass crashing) (Rebecca gasps) - Yo, baby. Hey, honey, hey. Girl, what's the matter with you? You been in jail or what? Honey, honey, I'm sorry. I thought it was somebody else. (light jazz music) (moves into suspenseful music) - It's 35,000, excuse me a second. Hello, how are you? Hi, glad you could make it. Hello, I'm Diana Bernstein, the owner. Do I know you? - I'm just here with someone. - Oh really, who? - Will I do, Diana? - Oh, well, I'm really glad you could make it. - Thanks. - Now, I believe we really have met somewhere before, haven't we? - I don't think so. - Oh, I'm almost certain. - Um, would you mind terribly getting me a glass of white wine? - Certainly, now don't go away, will you? - (screams) Oh, stupid, idiotic thing you. Do you believe her? - [Woman] Oh! - [Lady] Excuse me. - [Man] Hey, hey, hey, hey, watch out. - [Female] Excuse me! - Julie, excuse me a second, Julie! What happened to you? Where the hell have you been? Julie, who was that old guy out there with the crew cut? - Julie? - Hey look, this is no damn time for games, okay. I thought I told you never to come down here. (pounding on door) Damn it, it's a private office. - [Crew Cut] Open the door! I said open it! (pounding on door) Open the door! - Rick's, okay, the place we used to meet on Kay Street. You wait for me there, all right, go, go. Hey, hey, damn it, what the hell! - [Crew Cut] Get outta my way! (suspenseful music) (light piano music) ♪ Got the wishin' for you blues, baby ♪ ♪ Except wishin' don't make it true ♪ ♪ Got the wishin' for you blues, baby ♪ ♪ And it's got me feelin' really blue ♪ ♪ Hang in there Tony ♪ ♪ It's only two, she'll show ♪ ♪ Starts so damn hot with lots of lovin' ♪ - Thanks for cheering me up, Rick. ♪ All I really know ♪ ♪ When it's over and you're hurtin' ♪ ♪ Ain't none of it understood ♪ ♪ Got the wishin' for you blues, baby ♪ ♪ Except wishin' don't make it true ♪ ♪ Got the wishin' for you blues, baby ♪ ♪ And it's got me feelin' blue ♪ - Hey, hey, I was afraid you weren't gonna show up. Act like nothing is wrong, okay, hey. Okay listen, my car is parked on the next block, let's go. That old guy from the gallery, you ever seen him before tonight? - No. - You gotta know I looked all over hell for you. You wanna tell me where you been? - Maybe later. - When we get home, right? - Home? (light jazz music) (light jazz music) - Can you tell me what the hell's going on? - What do you want me to say? - I don't know. How about I'm sorry? I'm glad to see ya. I'm happy I'm home. - It's just this uh, headache won't go away. - Well, I'll get ya a couple aspirin. Those nightmares, huh? I keep trying, but uh, I can't seem to get you right. Hey, do you have any idea what I went through in the last three days, huh? Afraid to turn on the TV or look in a newspaper? Positive that they might have found ya? - They? - You know that there's no statute of limitations on murder. - Murder, you think I killed someone? - Who are you? No, not the name we made up. Who you really are. - [Rebecca] I don't remember. - You remember me finding you in the parking garage at the museum? - No. - Nothing, Saigon Charlie, the guy that doctored you up at the Empress Hotel? Franklin Tilly? - Who's Franklin Tilly? - Not is, was. The highly overrated curator, pompous ass, vicious art critic. Hey, I, I never even got to the reception. On the way, on the way to the hospital, on the radio I heard that Tilly had been shot, and they gave a real nice description of the woman that did it. - Me? - Close enough. - Then why didn't you turn me into the police? - Because I figured amongst the thousands of people that wanted Tilly dead at least once, including myself, you probably just got there first. You didn't look like the murderess type, much less did you know who or where you were when I found ya. (light jazz music) Do you remember me giving you that? - No. - Have you read what it says inside? Well then, you know why I brought you back to the Empress Hotel. I didn't plan on falling in love with you, I just did. (Tony whistling) Good, you're up. Look, I'm already late, here. Listen, that phone rings today, you let the answering machine pick it up, all right? Stay in today, please. I think it'd be a good idea if you went back to being a redhead. Be safer that way. I love you. (light jazz music) (telephone ringing) - Hello, who is this? Hello, hello. I don't know who. It could be Tony's cleaning lady for all I know. - [Limo Driver] Call again and ask this time. (telephone beeping) - Jarman, J-A-R-M-A-N. (telephone ringing) (mysterious music) - Here you go. - [Rebecca] Thank you. - Nice to see you again. (mysterious music) - The tragedy occurred only minutes before Payton Massey was to formally donate the 43 million dollar Van Gogh. Massey watched helplessly as the woman shot the internationally known art critic and managing curator. Dozens of guests who later witnessed the woman's desperate escape provided police with an excellent description, see. (mysterious music) (knocking on door) I tried to call. - I must've been at the market. - Shouldn't Priscilla be home from school by now? You let Andrew take her back, didn't you? - You know with my arthritis I can't take care of her. - Momma, I only asked for a few days. - Rebecca, for two years I didn't know whether you were alive or dead. In the middle of the night I get a call, no hello, how are you, no explanation. Just Priscilla's on the train. - [Rebecca] You don't understand. - No, I don't, but maybe you can explain to me how you could dessert your own child. - No, I can't. I don't know. Momma, I'm in trouble. - What kind of trouble? Can you go to the police? Because they think you might've done something. Have you, have you? - I don't know. - I was afraid it was something like this. Especially when he came asking about you. - Who came asking about me? - He had one of those funny, old style haircuts, you know. - Crew cut, Momma, I gotta go. - Rebecca, where? Dear God, what have you done? (mysterious music) - [Payton] Tony, my dear boy, this is Payton Massey. I know this is short notice, but I, I thought I'd open up the summer house in Shelter Bay for dinner with a few friends tonight. - Hello? - [Payton] I'd love to have you join. - Tony? - [Payton] And please, bring someone. Preferably, one of those lovely things I always see hanging all over you at your shows. Don't disappoint me, Tony. See you at eight. Tony, dear boy, this is Payton Massey. I know this is short notice, but. This is Payton Massey. House at Shelter Bay for dinner with a few friends. - [Tony] You've been out. - [Payton] I'd love you have you join, and please bring someone. - I went to the library. - The newspaper articles again? - [Payton] Preferably, one of those lovely things. - Did you ever think that maybe you never really will remember what happened that night? - [Payton] Don't disappoint me Tony. See you at eight. - How do you know Payton Massey? - He was the first really important private collector to buy me. Against Franklin Tilly's advice I might add. - You're friends? - Well, I met him at the museum at the gallery. Not exactly like I get invited to dinner, why? - We've been invited to dinner. - Just forget it, all right. The whole idea is totally insane. I mean, why do you think I kept you away from the gallery and everything else? - [Rebecca] Maybe he won't recognize me looking like this. - And if he does? - He's the only one who saw the woman. - Well, according to him the woman he saw was you. - Do you think it was me? - No, I don't know. - That's why I've gotta ask him. - Yeah well, it's completely out of the question, because there's something that you don't understand. I love you. - I need time. - All right. - Did I love you? - I thought so. (light jazz music) - Shelter Bay, please. (light jazz music) (moves into suspenseful music) (Rebecca gasps) - What the hell are you doing here? - What're you doing here? You left two hours ago, and why is he here? - I thought I could lose him. He followed me from the time I left the loft. He knows where we live. - Tony, there's something I've gotta tell you. - Listen to me. Now, where almost there. I want you to take the ferry back. You get a room at The Empress, and you wait until I get there. I love you. (suspenseful music) Go! - [Crew Cut] Damn! - What a delightful surprise. Oh good, the limousine is here. You are going to Payton Massey's? - Yes. - [Man] Good. Is this your first time at the summer house? - [Rebecca] Yes. - [Man] I think you're in for quite a surprise. - Good evening, ma'am. - Is everything all right, hmm? Come on, we're horribly late for dinner. - [Butler] Good evening, sir. - Mm hmm, ah yes, come on. There's someone I'd like you to meet, Tony. Good evening, Senator. Mrs. Simms, Mr. Tony Clay. - Ah, pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Simms, and so nice of you to invite me, Payton. Oh, do call me Payton, everyone does. Delightful chap, isn't he? - Of course, I did meet Andy Warhol once at a discotheque in New York. - Must've been something. - Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll be so kind as to return to the salon for the musical. I'm sorry, sir, the salon is that way. - All right. (mysterious music) - You wanted me to come here. - [Payton] Yes, and you are wondering why, are you not? - It's the Van Gogh you donated. The painting in the museum is a fake. - No, not a fake, Mrs. Simms. A stunningly magnificent counterfeit. So good that even the fools who call themselves experts will never discover it. - But why? - I come here, I get to keep it. Oh, and a 43 million dollar tax write-off. It's a very interesting act you've been putting on, Mrs. Simms, pretending not to recognize me, but we both know that you do and why? - I didn't even know who you were until-- - Oh, come now, Mrs. Simms. - Why won't you believe me? (light violin music) You're not gonna let me leave here tonight. - On the contrary, I will be quite happy to let my chauffeur to drive you home, to your real home that is, in Valley Green. In fact, if you hurry, you may just arrive there before the police. - Why would the police come to my house? - Now, where would a desperate woman hide a murder weapon, hmm? Closet somewhere, a shoebox perhaps? Yes, yes, you're right. The very weapon you used to kill poor Franklin Tilly. - If I had killed him, how would you know where I hid the gun? - Because we put it there. - Why me? - You know, a jury will believe almost anything of a woman who abandoned her daughter to live with her lover. Wouldn't you say, Mrs. Simms? But then, perhaps you'll have time to explain all this to your daughter before you're arrested. (light violin music) (guests applauding) - Ah, damn it! (suspenseful music) - You're very lucky, Mrs. Simms. That night at the museum I really was going to kill you, except you crashed through a window, and by the time I get to you you disappeared. - The man with the crew cut, he worked for you too, didn't he? - [Limo Driver] What man with a crew cut? - Well, how did you know I was there the night you broke into my house then, not Andrew? - It was the girl. The one we hired to be his girlfriend. Home sweet home, Mrs. Simms. - Please tell me why? - You really don't know, do you? Wouldn't help you now, Mrs. Simms, even if you did. (sirens wailing) (suspenseful music) (knocking on door) - Andrew! (knocking on door) - No Rebecca, no. Now, whatever this is all about. Whatever's going on out there, I don't need this! I've had it! Rebecca, what the hell are you doing? - Didn't you know she was working for them? - Who, what're you talking about? Rebecca, Rebecca! (suspenseful music) - [Priscilla] Mom! - Those bastards! - Leave her be, Rebecca, leave her be. You've upset her enough! - No matter what they say, baby, don't believe it. I love you. (sirens wailing) - Have you gone completely insane? (sirens wailing) - [Officer] Roger, here we go! - [Policeman] Let's go, go! - Gibson, Seger, Briggs! Police, open up! Open up, police! - [Rebecca] get out. - I'm afraid I got bad news, Mrs. Simms. You see uh, I unloaded that myself. - I don't believe you, but then I have nothing to lose by finding out, do I? - Go ahead. (gun firing) (glass crashing) - I think you better get out. (suspenseful music) (knocking on door) - Come in, Mrs. Simms. - Don't say anything, he's a cop. - A little out of my jurisdiction, but I was convinced they were gonna retire me before I ever saw you again. Better give me that. - Julie, where'd the gun come from? - Just a wild guess, I'd say it's the gun that killed Franklin Tilly. - You planted it at my house in my daughters bedroom. - Nice try, Mrs. Simms, but I knew it was you we were looking for the first time I saw your picture on the missing persons flyer from the Valley Green PD. The trouble was you stayed missing, and then two years later out of nowhere, boom, there you were. - Hold it. - [Clayton] Put that gun away. - Careful now, Mrs. Simms. Let's not have another murder. - This police officer is here to arrest Mrs. Simms. - He can't. (vase crashing) - I remember. - The price has just gone up Payton, one million. - [Payton] You made a deal with me. - My integrity is really worth more. - [Payton] Integrity, you never had any integrity to sell. What I bought was your silence. - You have more to lose than I, Payton. - [Payton] You fool. - No, don't! - [Payton] You're threatening me? - No, don't, Payton! You're mad, Payton, no, no! (vase crashing) - Put that gun away, you damn stupid fool. - You don't understand. He can't arrest her. - Payton, you're mad, Payton, no, no! (vase crashing) (gun firing) - Get her! (suspenseful music) (glass crashing) - You killed him. - Get back, it's the gun she's got, Payton. - [Payton] What the hell are you talking about? - I forgot to unload it. You're fingerprints are all over the bullets. - I'll be damned. Payton Massey on a murder one. In homicide they'll put up a plaque with my name on it. - Including the date of your unfortunate demise. You realize they all have to die now? - I know, I'm, I'm sorry, Payton. It's the, it's the only time I've ever let you down. (gun firing) - I wouldn't! Think about it, Massey. All your money, I'd take my chances in a courtroom. - You all right? - [Crew Cut] It's all over, Mrs. Simms. - The Van Gogh in the museum is a fake. The man he killed must've discovered it. - Actually, I paid Franklin Tilly a half million dollars not to discover it. Unfortunately, he was also a greedy man. No one blackmails me. Rather a nasty surprise seeing you in that doorway, Mrs. Simms, but you have to admit, I took brilliant advantage of your unexpected presence. - If it's all right with you, I'd like to call a cab and get her out of here. - I'll need a statement. Tomorrow will be soon enough. - It's okay. - Where to? - 2489 Walnut, Valley Green. My name is really Rebecca, Rebecca Simms, Mrs. Andrew Simms. I teach, I used to teach art at Saint Anne's Elementary. I also have an eight year old daughter who may never forgive me for any of this. - Is that where we're going? - It's where I'm going. - What about us, what's gonna happen to us? - Tony, if I remembered any of the things I just told you, there never would've been us. - That's it, you just go back, and you forget that you loved me or I loved you? - No, I'll never forget any of this, especially you. - Don't go. Forget I said that. Just forget it. Drop me off at the train station first, please. (light jazz music) - Tony, wait, there won't be another train till the 6:12 commute. - Yeah. - I wanted to tell you who I was on the ferry. It's not like I wanna say goodbye, you know. - Then you won't mind if I don't. (light jazz music) - [Priscilla] But why, Andrew, why? - Some things can't be explained, honey, especially when I don't understand them myself. (car door thuds) - [Priscilla] Is it Mom? - No, no, it's uh, some policeman. Probably forgot something. Now, you get to bed now, okay. I'll see you in the morning. Well, you gotta find Sergeant Taylor, and tell him that she's here. (knocking on door) Thank you. - The police? - They've already gone. I've made some coffee if you want some. - We've got a lot to talk about. - Yes. (knocking on door) I don't know who that is myself. I better go find out. - Momma. - Baby, sweetheart, come on. - Momma, Momma, I'm so scared. - It's all right, baby. Everything's gonna be all right now, okay. - [Crew Cut] Hello, Mrs. Simms. - What's happening, Rebecca? - I'm sorry to bother you again, but I'm afraid there's a couple of loose ends. - What kind of loose ends? - The child isn't upstair, upstairs. - I'm afraid you're all loose ends, Mrs. Simms. - How could he buy you? - Ah hell, Mrs. Simms, they're gonna retire me at the end of the month. 30 years I've been a cop, and the only damn thing I got to look forward to is a pension I can't even go fishing on, and an ex-wife who wants half of that. - Sorry, Mrs. Simms, wrong time, wrong place again. - No, Tony won't-- - Will probably be at the station until the 6:12 commuter arrives. Plenty of time. - Let's get on with it. - Andrew. (Andrew grunts) - They'll wonder why you did it, Mrs. Simms. Guilt probably, hmm? Leaving your only child. - You talk too much, Massey. - Understandable how that would drive someone to destroy everything and everyone until they kill themselves. How long before you get greedy? (gun firing) (Rebecca screaming) - What the hell! (Rebecca grunting) It's not gonna work, Mrs. Simms. (gun firing) - Okay kid, right by me at the door, now. Drop the gun, do it. - Help me. - [Sergeant Taylor] Get away from him, Mrs. Simms. - Get me out of here, how much? A million, five million, no, huh?
