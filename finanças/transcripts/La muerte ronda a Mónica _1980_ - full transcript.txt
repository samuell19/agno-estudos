Mister Haimer, the contracts for the buildings in Montreal? Elena will deal with them. We have other things to do. - Today Elena is coming late. - She'll deal with them when she comes. If someone asks for me, I'll be at the boss's office. Eurozona. Yes, good morning. One moment please. Signora Monica it's already nine o'clock. - And my husband? Has he already had breakfast? - Yes. Today he left sooner than usual. I didn't hear him leave. Pardon me madam, but don't you think you're taking too many pills? They're only light stimulants, they can't harm me. Your husband doesn't agree with this. - If only I could resolve everything with pills. - Shall I prepare you your bath, madam? The "Belle Arti" will never grant us permission. - Is it a big project? - 150 rooms Bermuda style and 60 bungalows. This doesn't regard me. It's Arturo's responsibility. Ha! Now you're salting the wound. Luisa is searching for Arturo since Friday and he's nowhere to be found. - Did she call his home? - Yes, she left numerous messages. She even sent him a telegram last night. He never changes. Always unpredictable. Luisa? Come here please. - Yes sir? - On Arturo's desk there's a green notebook. It contains all of his private numbers. Call them all and ask for him. - I'm calling in your name? - No, I'm afraid it wouldn't work. - In his lawyer's name? - He'd know it was me. - From the police? No. Pretend you're one of his lovers. - But what are you saying? - It'll work. If he's there he'll come to the phone, I'm certain. - But I don't know how to do these things. - It's time you learned. - Elena hasn't arrived yet? - I don't think so. Call her at home and tell her to come here immediately. - And what about the "Belle Arti" business? - We'll deal with it later. Now call Elena. - Ok. Hi Maria. Is the signora awake? Tell her it's me and that I must speak to her urgently. It's very important. - Yes madam. Signora it's miss Elena. It's the tenth time she's calling today, but you were asleep and I didn't want to disturb you. Says it's important. Ok, let's see what's it all about. Yes, hello. Hi Elena. What, right now? It would be better if I came at your place. Yes Federico is at the office. Don't worry. They're used to my delays at the office. There are things more important than Eurozona to me. I'll be there as soon as possible. Bye. It was embarassing. Please don't ever make me do such a thing again. - What's the name of that girl? - Joan, her last name I don't know. One of the girls from the club told me that. Here's the address and her phone number. - It was a success to find out her name, but really embarassing. - Calm down, have a drink. - No, it would only make me feel worse. - Ok, as you wish. - Federico we don't have much time. - Where are the blueprints? - There. - Ok, let's go. Arturo, someone's at the door. Who cares. What are you doing, put aut the lights! Where are you going? One can't have a moment's quiet around here. Who is it? - You've got mail madam. - Leave it outside in the box. - You have to sign, it's a telegram. A telegram? - Where is he? - But you're not the postman. - How did you guess? Hey, wait a minute, what do you want? - But who, what are you doing here? - Rise, be quick. It's time for work. - But why did you let him in? Leave me alone. - Leave this house at once. - Look beautiful, don't waste my time You can do what you like, but he's coming with me, is that clear? You know something? You're not bad looking. Why don't you jump into the bed with us? - Another time gorgeous. Come on get up! - Leave him alone. Can't you see he's resting? - Don't bother. You don't know him. If he says I must go, I must go. He's more stubborn than a mule. Hey, who the hell are you? What do you mean who I am? You don't remember? - We met at the club. - Yes, now I remember. Federico, I present you my friend Joan, a woman who can make you forget all your troubles. - Pleased to meet you. - But what's going on? - Today we must present the contracts. - Every time you let panic get the best of you. And how the hell did you manage to find me? - Diego, what are you doing here? - Vincent, old boy. Is this the way to greet a friend? After all it's only been 10 years. 10 years and one day to be exact. - What do you want? - Just to chat. You haven't changed at all. - When were you released? - This morning. Hey, it seems things are going well for you. No, they're rather bad. I barely manage to pay the taxes. - Times have changed. - Don't worry, I'm not here to ask you for money. - But I'd gladly have something to drink. - Certainly. - A propo, what about Federico? - Federico? Have a look at the projects. Haimer must deliver them today at two. You must be crazy. With Monica's money you could live the rest of your years without working. And still, you're working like a slave. I really don't get you. You still aren't over the fact that I stole Monica from you? Now wait a minute. You haven't stolen nobody from me. She wanted to get married and you know my views on that subject. That was the only reason I left her to you. The only one! - Stop here for a moment. - What now? - Wait, I have to go to that boutique. Only for a minute, please. Don't waste my time. You lousy good for nothing, you rotten bastard, you! You didn't even send me a card! How could I? I was in the desert! Sure and in the meantime you were dating my cousin Marianna! - Darling, calm down. What will those nice ladies think? - I don't give a shit about what they'll think! - Out of here now! No, dear, you're staying with me. You swine. Let's continue our talk. - You were always on my mind. - And what about my cousin? - I haven't had the pleasure of knowing her. - Tell me what have you been doing all those days. - I'll let you know with a kiss. - You are incurably crazy. - You should be happy with someone as unpredictable as me. - I'll send the girls away, we'll lock the door and... - No, no. I can't, there's a client breathing down my neck. Pardon me madam, can I have my associate back? You must sign a very important document. - Why did I listen to you when you proposed to me to become a patrner in the company? - Finished? Let's go. - We could have lunch later. I'll wait here. - Don't count on it. Today we have a business lunch and Arturo can't be absent. Then come after that. And if you're tired, you could rest here with me. I'm sorry, but he's so busy that he can't dedicate to you not even one minute for the next 3 days. - Has anybody told you you're hateful? - Yes, many times, but I don't let it bother me. We're running late Arturo, let's go. Next time you won't find me, I swear. Bye darling. Who knows if I'll still be waiting for you. Easy. - Goodmorning Maria. Is the signora expecting me? - Yes. - Does he bark like that at everyone? - Yes, he's an excellent watchdog. At night Isidoro sets him free and you can be sure that noone dares to approach. - What a temperament! - Clean up those lipstick marks, if you don't want Elena mad at you. Yeah, that babe's crazy for me. But I can't handle them all anymore. - Morning Monica. - Hi Elena, you came fast. What's going on? Is it that important? More than you can imagine. How are things with Federico? Something tells me that you can answer that for me. You're right, but first I have to hear it from you. Tell me honestly. Is your marriage happy? Lately something has changed. I don't know. For more than a year now, Federico only thinks about work. - Undoubtedly that's strange, right? - Yes. Do you know something that I don't? I'm afraid yes. I'm here to help you save your marriage. And I hope it's not too late. Let's hope not. Tell me Elena, I'm listening. The company's name is Eurozona. It's in the area of Casteleri. - I don't know the number, you'll find it in the phone book. - Very good. I'll leave my suitcase here. I'm going to pay a visit to our partner. I'm sure he won't be glad to see me. I'll let you know how it goes. - Diego, listen, if you need anything, some money... - No thanks. Our friend Federico owes me. And now it's time to collect. It's nice here. Maybe I'll come and stay with you like I used to in the past. See you later. Ah, don't call him, ok? I'd like to surprise him. - The thought didn't cross my mind. - I'm glad. It would be innoportune. - Is that her? - Yes. Her name's Eva. A model. Anything else? Federico met her during the publicity campaign for the new residential area. It was my job to find an interesting face for the campaign. And she was among the girls you chose. You must believe me. I wouldn't have told you anything if I thought it was just a fling. You mean it's more than that? I'm afraid so. And that could also compromise the company's good name. The trust that the banks have shown to Eurozona is also based on the proprietor's moral standing. I don't care about the company. I'm worried about my husband. That's why I'm here dear. Your husband spends a lot of money for her. Jewels, furs. And he's gonna give her an appartment in the new residential zone. I was aware for sometime now that something was wrong. In order for you to deal with this situation, you must first be certain for your feelings towards him. - Do you love him? - More than ever. - And despite everything you are determined to save your marriage? Despite everything. What should I do in your opinion? That's it Eva. Show me your thigh. Good. Now move a bit, come on. Nice. Taxi! To Castelverde. Listen, maybe we should stop. You don't seem into it today. How come? - I don't know. - Want to call it a day? - No, let's try again after the break. - Excuse me, where can I find Eva Schiller? - She's there with the photographer. Ok, we'll give it another shot in the afternoon. - Today there's something wrong with you. Are you not feeling well? - No, in the afternoon I'll be fine. - I hopo so. Don't eat too much, eh? Eva, someone's here to see you. Put your cards on the table. Apart from the morbid desire to see what your husband's lover looks like, is there something else? - Yes, I love Federico. That's wonderful, but I don't see what that's got to do with me. I love Federico and what he represents. In other words, my marriage. That's the reason I'm here. I only found out this morning and I decided to come and see you. You shouldn't have come. You should have controlled that impulse. In your place I wouldn't have done it. Your husband is a reasonable man. Why don't you clear matters with him? What does Federico mean to you? Would you be ready to give up everything for him? No, please Monica, now you're being melodramatic. And melodrama is outmoded. So let me ask you a precise question. Tell me what do you intend to do? Are you going to ask him for a divorce? No. This whole situation is new to me. - Does Federico love you? - He can't live without me, that's what he always tells me. - Could you live without him? - I don't feel like confessing to you. Listen to me, talk to Federico. It's he who must make the decision. How much do you want to forget Federico for ever? You keep on behaving like a little girl. - Money doesn't mean anything to you? - Of course it does. And I can tell that it means a lot to your husband too. He married you, didn't he? And now I have to go. I must continue my work. Have a nice day. What if the bank blocks our credit? What then? - Then we're in deep shit. - I suggest we go for lunch. I know a formidable russian restaurant, I'll ask the secretary to book us a table. Yes, tell me. Doesn't ring a bell. Did he tell you his name? Yes I remember. Ask him to wait. I'll see him in a minute. Thanks. Trouble? No, no, nothing. Someone I wasn't expecting to see anymore. What happened signora? - You're not well? - No, it's nothing. - Signor Arturo? - Yes gorgeous? - The table has been booked for 2 o'clock. Good. You're an angel. If the business weren't going so bad I'd marry you. Ok, we have a table, but we must promise not to talk business. It's just the two of us. Federico doesn't feel like it anymore. - What happened? - Nothing important. You go ahead. We'll meet here at six. Pardon me. As you wish. let's go. Ok Luisa, let the gentleman in. And I don't want to be disturbed, ok? Signore, you can go now. Who knows what that urgent business of Federico's about? Why are you laughing? Must be an affair of the heart. I know about those things. He's trying to imitate me. You said it. He can only imitate you, but never surpass you. - You were unlucky, that's all there is to it. - No, the fact is that they were informed. Somebody must have talked to the police. Perhaps. - But there wasn't anyone else in this but us. - And isn't it strange that you got away with it? - Just luck. - Right, and luck is blind. - Let bygones be bygones, we can't change what happened. I paid for both of us. in the meantime you've had quite a career, from what I see. - It's not as good as you think. - We'll talk about it some other time. Now let's talk about my compensation. Ok, let's hear it. I want half of your part of the company. You're crazy. You don't know what you're talking about. - You think so? - You're far from reality. Is that your wife? Not bad, my compliments. - I would have sworn that she'd be older. A beautiful woman. I bet you're happy together. - Did you come here to talk about my personal affairs? - Poor signora. It has passed now. Are you feeling better? - Yes, much better. - You want me to call your husband? - That won't be necessary. You can go now Maria. Thanks. Even if I wanted, I couldn't. We are three partners in the company. So every payment must be approved by all three. No problem. There's always your personal account. It's a joint account with my wife. - Any withdrawal needs both our signatures. - Then we'll ask your wife. I'm sure she'll understand. - Understand what? - That there will be a new associate. Her husband's associate. Listen to me Diego. My wife must stay out of this. She knows nothing about your past, right? About the contaband, the drugs, the kidnappings. These things belong to the past. Very well. Then make me an offer. How much do you think that my silence is worth? You must have access to some money for emergencies. Take it. That's all I can give you. I didn't come here to ask for charity. But I'll accept it as a down payment. - We're done Diego. No more checks or visits. - I don't think so. It won't be difficult for someone like you to get a bank loan. - Don't talk nonsense. - It's not nonsense. It's a regular business transaction. And better think twice before going to the police about this. Remember that you have to lose a lot more than I do. - Get out! - Easy friend, calm down and start looking for money. These are just enough for me to drink to your wife's health. Be seeing you. Bye. Monica came to see me this morning. - What? - It was tremendously comical. Like a melodramatic film from the forties . She came to offer me money to leave you. She offered you money? Yes. What should I do? It's an absurd situation. How should I handle it? It's just too ridiculous. Not for me. - Now what are you doing? Leaving? - Yes. I want to find out what's going on. - Monica? - It's me. - Hi dear, how are you? - I'm feeling better. I'm glad. So, did you see Eva? - Yes. - How did it go? It was a terrible experience. And what are you going to do now? - I have decided to leave Federico. - But dear... ... are you certain about it? - Yes, it's an irrevocable decision. - You obviously know what you're doing, but try not to get too upset. I'll call you later. Bye. - Bye. - Please call me tomorrow? - Ok. - Bye darling. - Bye. - See you soon. Hello? He just left. - I need it immediately and don't tell me no. - But Diego, try to understand. Do as I say. You must be pleased. We finally made it. Monica decided to leave him. - Now how am I supposed to behave with Federico. - Simple. As before. Don't forget that your bank account will be benefiting significantly from this. Besides, this morning appeared someone who could prove very helpful to our plans. That's precisely the moment in which Federico should have emotional complications with a woman like you. - I don't understand Elena. - It would be very useful if he was to fall in love with you so deeply that he would lose his bearings about the other stuff that concerns him. And after Monica's and Federico's separation what's gonna happen to the company? I'll be the one who controls it dear. - And what about Arturo? - The majority of the shares is mine. But what if Monica doesn't leave him? You mean that she might forgive him? - Exactly. - I count on you for that. You're too beautiful for this to happen. - I see it's no use trying to talk you out of it. - Exactly. It's useless. No matter what you told me, I wouldn't change my mind. After our first year of marriage you've ignored me. I thought your work was to blame. Now I know I was wrong. I met that woman at a difficult time for me. - Can I try to explain? - You don't have absolutely nothing to explain. - This morning I went to see her. - I know. I was curious to meet her, but it was a horrible experience. When I saw her in front of me I almost lost it. It was as if my world was collapsing. But then I found my self control. I calmed down. Now everything's over. I'm leaving as soon as I've packed my things. - Please listen to me. - Sorry, it's too late now. - I will leave Eva. - For me? Amusing. You wouldn't be worried of losing my bank account? Not to mention the presidency of Eurozona? Admit it Federico, that's the truth. No use deceiving ourselves. For you I was just a bank account with many zeros. I'm only interested in your money up to a certain point. - You know that very well. - What are you afraid of? Of the scandal, or of your associates' reaction when the bank stops giving you credit? Is that what worries you? - How wrong you are Monica. - No, I'm not wrong, I'm certain about it since this morning. - What do you mean? - That I'm not as naive as you thought. The profits of the company should be divided in half with you, right? Then how you account for these losses? I see you are well informed. My compliments. I've assigned the case to my lawyers. The counsil of administration must be informed that our funds are no longer common. - Are you certain about this? - Yes, absolutely. But you don't have to worry about a scandal. I'll do everything discreetly. Regarding Eurozona, you must get used to consider me a simple advisor. I'm sorry Federico, but you no longer hold the majority of the shares. Ok, I got it. But it's time to stop Monica. Till now I listened to you. Now you must listen to me. The most important thing for me now is to save our love. - Hi. - Hi. You're not feeling well? Has something happened? Monica knows everything about me and Eva. Wow! Must have been quite a blow for her. What are you going to do? I'll find the most reasonable solution possible. The arrival of that man who talked to Monica last night gives me a clear perspective on the situation. What are you trying to say? That now is the time to make a definitive decision. Which would be? I love Monica. That's all. You mean that you'll leave Eva? Exactly. I know your boss isn't here for anyone, but I bet he's gonna see me. - I must speak to him. - One moment. Yes Luisa? Yes, he can come in. My friend is back. - Want me to call the police? - No, I'd rather you didn't. Ok, as you wish. - Good morning. - Good morning. Come in please. - Thank you. - Good morning mister Arturo. - Good morning. What did I tell you? Your plan has failed. It was a waste of time. I knew that he'd never leave her. Don't be such a pessimist. It's not certain yet. Have patience. I'll call you in 30 minutes. There's no money Diego. I've told you. - Is that your final word? - Yes. Even if I wanted I couldn't give you any. It's all invested at the moment. I must say that your wife is really cute. Last night I was able to admire her in person. But things don't seem to be working out. You came home late, or to be accurate, at dawn, and she was waiting for you rather anxiously. And she made a scene. Where were you? What are you trying to say? If I was in your shoes, I'd be more discreet. Your servants don't spend the night at home. There's only that watchdog. Not a problem for an expert. Federico it's really simple. - What do you have in mind? - Just to have a chat with the one who has the money. If you don't have them, I know where to get them. You bastard get out of here! If you come close to my house or this office again, I'll break your neck. You won't do a thing. Your prestige is more important than anything else. You and your wife will hear from me. Now that scandals are in vogue many magazines would pay a fortune to be able to publish a story on the things that I know. And haven't told anyone yet. Bye Federico. Certainly I'll meet you tonight. That's a promise. See you later darling. Monica you look fabulous. If your husband weren't my associate and if I didn't respect him so much, you and I could be more intimate than just friends. So what happened? I know you too well. When you rub your hands like that it means you're about to say something important. - Am I right? - Yes, it's important, at least to me. Okay, let's hear it. I'm all ears. - Federico has a lover. - Federico has a lover! I can't believe it! What sort of absurdity is this? Unfortunately it's the sad reality. That's why I asked you to come here. You're my best friend, you know that? The only person to whom I can confide. And here I was thinking that you hated me for having introduced you to an infallible robot, and now it's that robot who commited a mistake. What does she look like? Is she old? - Here. That's her. - Hey, will he lend her to me if I ask him? Don't joke about it Arturo. What will I do? Should I forgive him? Nonsense. There's nothing to forgive him for. I'm not saying that you should thank him, but if you love him, You do love him, right? - Yes, despite everything. - Then there's no problem. - I'm sure that he has told you that it was nothing serious. - Yes, but what if he was lying? I hope you aren't expecting me to do away with that babe. Come on Monica, be reasonable, if Federico promised he'll stop seeing her, he'll do it. - Thanks. That's what I wanted to hear. - I bet Elena had something to do with it. Have I guessed right? Yes, it was her who told me, but she did it with the best of intentions. Certainly, with the best of intentions, and you were this close to destroying your marriage. Go figure. Let's try to use our brains and everything will go according to plan. We're very close to winning Eurozona. Let's not forget this. - Yes Elena. - Good night. - Good night. Do you need anything signora? - No, you can go. - Will your husband be dining here tonight? - No, he'll be back late. See you tomorrow. I hope that I have the right to know one thing Federico. Are you absolutely certain of what you're doing? Please Eva, don't make it more difficult than it has to be. You don't love your wife. Isn't that right Federico? Goodbye Eva. Tomorrow I'll send you the contract for the appartment. I'm not going to give you up so easily. Goodbye Eva. Who is it? What do you want? Don't move! Don't come any closer! I have a gun! Don't move! Who are you? What do you want from me? Go away! Don't force me to shoot! Federico! Federico! What happened? - What's going on? - It was horrible. - I've killed someone. - What are you saying? He's in the house. Calm down. How did he get in? From the kitchen window. He broke the glass. His face was covered with this. - Did you take it off him? - Yes. Someone must have heard the shots. I don't think so. Isidoro and Maria are sleeping on the other side of the garden and had they heard something they would be here already. It's possible that noone heard a thing. - And now what, Federico? - Calm down, you have nothing to fear. - But I've killed a man. - It was he who attacked you. And you killed him in legitimate defense. - But will the police believe that version? - Get dressed Monica. - Shouldn't you call your lawyer? - I don't know. Let me think about it. Now get dressed and stop worrying. - I think I've found the solution. - Are we going to the police or are we informing the lawyer? Neither. - There would be a scandal and we can't permit this. I knew that man. - You knew him? Yes he was an extortionist, one of the many seedy types that scourge the business world. - So what are you going to do? - Are you better now? - Yes. - You want to help me? - Sure. - This won't be easy. - What do we have to do? - We must get rid of the corpse. - What are you saying? It's the only solution. - But it won't resolve anything. - On the contrary, it will resolve everything. There's nothing that connects you to this. So they'll find a dead body, but why should they suspect you? - Where will we take him? - Come. Here the lake is very deep. It will take time before someone finds him. I can't believe we're doing this. Stay calm. There's nothing to worry about. What happened is over now. As soon as we get back to the house, you'll take some sleeping pills and go to bed. And try to forget everything. - You haven't told me how things went with Eva. - It's over. When I return from Barcelona we'll talk about it. - You must go to Barcelona? - Yes. I'm leaving early in the morning, but I'll back in time for dinner. I've an appointment with the bank's general director that I can't miss. - Is it so important? - Yes. But as I told you I'll be back soon. Please don't go. I don't want to stay here alone. Don't be afraid. It's almost seven. Isidoro and Maria will be here soon. Try to get some rest. See you tonight darling. See you tonight. - Good morning. - Ah, good morning. - Here are the documents you asked for. - Thanks. When you're done here don't forget to clean up the garage. Isidoro! - What? - It's horrible, look! Who could have done such a thing? Signora wake up, wake up! Hi beautiful, I know a hungarian restaurant that's the eighth wonder of the world. It's fantastic. There's a couple of violinists who continuously play sentimental songs that will move even the most cold-hearted. I'm very tired. I didn't get much sleep last night. One more reason for you to accept my invitation. - Don't insist. - Come on Monica, this could be your chance to get back at your husband for cheating on you. Lunch was just an excuse. Tell me, how are things with Federico? - Fine. We discussed things. Now he's in Barcelona. - I know, that's why I called you. - Pardon me but I insist... - No, thank you. I just want to get some rest. - Maybe that's what you need. Bye Monica, I'll see you tomorrow. - Bye Arturo. - Do you think that Monica went with him in Barcelona? - No. I'm certain she remained here. - What, you had the nerve to call her? - Not me dear. I sent that cretin, Arturo, this morning to her place to check on her. I hope you haven't told him anything that could compromise us. No, I just told him that it would be nice if he offered her emotional support, now that she's dealing with a marital crisis. Then everything's ok. So now she's alone, at our disposal. - But for how long? - She'll be alone all day. I arranged things so that Fedrico would encounter certain difficulties in Barcelona. His return will be delayed. And we'll have plenty of time for playing with our dear friend Monica. See you later darling. But you told me you would be back tonight. No, nothing happened. But I'd feel better if you were here. Yes, yes, I know, it's important. I could get a plane and be there soon. It's not absurd at all. I don't want to stay here alone. Fine, tomorrow, you promise? Yes ok. Call me to tell me the number of your flight and I'll come to pick you up. Don't worry. I'll be fine. Bye. Hello? Ah, Elena it's you, yes fine. Very well. Come and pick me up in ten minutes. I'll wait for you. Bye. And now ladies and gentlemen, we will transmit a concert of a Bella Bartock symphony performed by the New York philarmonic orchestra. - Monica. - Yes, speaking. - Good evening Monica. -Who is this? - Listen, I must see you... Are you listening? Yes, but who are you? That's not important, I a friend of Diego's. You must have the wrong number. I don't know any Diego. But you do, and very well. You killed him last night. You and your husband threw him in the swamp. - What do you want? - I must speak with you immediately, otherwise I'm going to the police. - No, wait a minute! - Come and meet me. I'll be at the old place at the entrance of the residential area. The place where your parents used to live. Remember? And don't try any tricks. Come alone and as soon as possible. I'm very impatient. Yes, but I... Barcelona Palace Hotel, good evening. No, I'm sorry he already left. Yes I can assure you. No, I only know he's gone madam. I understand. Thank you. You've reached Elena Di Fuentes' answering machine. You can leave... - Careful of the stairs. - I'll fall into your arms. Who can it be? - I must answer the phone. - Oh, the hell with it. Could be urgent. - You mean that there's something more urgent than me? - ???? Yes, hello? Probably wrong number. Wait in the room at the tower. We'll be back when we'll be certain that noone has followed you. - Hello? - It's me Arturo. What? Has anything happened? - Please I need you, come immediately. - Ok, are you at home? No, but I'll be there soon. Please don't be late. I'm coming. Sorry baby but we have to postpone it. - What do you mean? You'll leave me here alone? - Turn the tv on, it'll help you fall asleep. Monica! What's wrong? What happened to you? - Monica you know that sometimes the effects of sleeping pills can... - No, I don't suffer from hallucinations. - I saw him upstairs. - What did you see? - The man that I killed. - What did you say? Yes, yes. It's incredible. You said that the spot where you dropped the corpse was at least 20 meters deep. - It would take a team of divers to drag him out of there. - Could be, but now he's here. What's going on? And Eva and Elena, who could have killed them? The same person who brought the corpse here. - I think I should inform the police. - You should have done this long ago. We were afraid. Federico thought that we'd be better off without the police. - Wasn't he supposed to return this evening? - He called me and said he's coming tomorrow. But then a strange thing happened. I called him later at his hotel. You wanted to tell him something? Yes, but they told me he had already left. I see. What's on your mind? The man you killed was an extortionist? That's what Federico said. Did you know he was your husband's partner? - That's impossible. - He was. That's why he was blackmailing him. But for what reason? There are things in your husband's past you know nothing about. That man was a member of a group that was founded by your husband. They were involved in contraband and many other things. The police arrested him and he paid for all of them. He did time and recently he was released. Didn't Federico tell you? No. Now I'm beginning to understand. You can't be suspecting Federico! You are always the proprietor of the residential area. That means that your husband can't sell the company shares without your approval, right? Though I can't see how the two corpses that you found in the old house fit into this. And why they sent you there. Listen Monica. You will not leave here. I'm going to check the old house. - Please don't go. Let's call the police. - No, not yet. First I must understand what's going on. Federico's strange behaviour, the fact that you killed a man who reappeared, maybe in that house I'll find proof of what I suspect. Don't open the door and don't respond at any calls. - Don't leave me here. I want to come with you. - You must stay out of this. Maybe this whole thing is a trap for you. Someone wanted you to go there but I don't know why. It could be very dangerous. You'll stay here. - Please be careful. Don't worry Monica, I'll be back soon. What happened, what's wrong dear? - What's the matter? - Stay where you are. Don't move. Don't come any closer Federico. - Come on. Give me the gun. - I said don't move! Come on, give it to me. Monica! Monica! Open the door Monica! Monica open! What have you done? - He was going to kill me. - Yes, just like he did with Elena, Eva and someone else. Because Monica, you didn't kill Diego. - What are you saying, I shot him. - Yes, but you did so with a gun prepared by your husband. Come here, look. This is the hole from the bullet's entrance. But the one from the exit isn't here. You get it? - No, I don't. - The gun was loaded with blanks. That's why there's only one hole. I noticed that before I left. And as I was driving to the old house everything became clear. The murderer is your husband. He wanted to incriminate you for his crimes. - But why? - It's really simple. So that you'd end up in the madhouse and he could have all your money. You'd have acted under the influence of barbiturics and the jury would have fallen for it. And Elena? Eva? Federico did it because Eva had a special relation with Elena. Last night he found out. Elena was using Eva to extract large amounts of money from him. He couldn't swallow it. He lost his mind and killed the both of them. Then he sent you to that house. To involve you in that crime also. That would be the coup de grace for you. He had prepared a solid alibi, his trip to Barcelona. There's still one thing I don't understand. - The other night that man was here. - That man was your husband. He made you shoot him with blanks to make you think you'd killed him. And then, after he hit you, he placed the real corpse beside you. - That's what really happened? - Exactly. Yes Arturo. Exactly. It all happened exactly this way. - Federico! - And the only one who could have possibly known is you. It was you who killed Diego. -In the way you just described. - You don't know what you're saying. This time it was I who substituted the real bullets in the gun. Just like you did the day you came to see Monica. I have suspected you since the beginning. I couldn't figure out your motive and I didn't have any proof. But yesterday I finally found out what was your game. You wanted to convince Monica that she was a murderess. You forced her to pull the trigger. A trap worthy of you. You lie! That story of yours is not credible at all! - Why would I... - With Elena out of the picture and me dead from Monica's hand you would be the sole proprietor of the company. Want more proof? You knew about Elena and Eva's affair. And for a male like you a sexual relation between women was unacceptable. Stay where you are! Don't move! Even if it was true, you wouldn't convince anyone. Eneryone will think you made it up. Noone will believe you. First of all you don't have an alibi! Moreover I don't have a criminal record. While your precedents would make you a perfect suspect. Hadn't you thought of that? Now's the time to call the police. And each will tell his version of the story. Stay where you are and don't move. Keep your hands where I can see them. - Is that him? - Yes, he entered the residential zone with two women around 10 o'clock. An hour later he exited the zone alone. I'm absolutely certain. subs by Bryan for cinemageddon
