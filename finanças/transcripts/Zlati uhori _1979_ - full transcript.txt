- I nearly saw my granny. - What? - Are you trying to kill us all? Take care! Slow down, I've had enough! Stop, you hear! Remember you have three kids. Where are we to sleep? There are beds for the women. As for us guys ... SUNG: A vagrant's home is anywhere. Moon and stars ... ... are his blankets. - Dad, stop, go back now! When we have come this far? Have you ever seen anything so beautiful? - Dad, who is that? - He's the ferryman and sorcerer in one person. Nice catch! Didn't I tell you? There's a lot of fish here. Now this is what I call the art of fishing. Angling with a rod. Have a look, mom. It is a concert. Can you hear Kubelik? Ladies and gentlemen, you are now witnessing the capture of a red assed minnow. Pure elegance. Did you notice its beard? A bellied rutilus, champion of the swift currents. It found its master at last. Ladies and gentlemen, this is true art. You have the right attitude. Never mind what people say. - Two more. - Three. - Why? - I don't want to be left out. - Tell us about Amman. - Anam. - It does not matter. - About the Japanese outpost in the jungle. - You don't know the story then? - I do not. - I would rather call it a log cabin though. A few bamboo houses protected with machine guns. We started walking normally. But in the end we crept like snakes. We knew how cruel the Japanese are. What's going on here? Quiet now and go to sleep! Come on! - Here What cover was daddy singing about? The stars will be your sheets. - Moon and stars will be your blankets. - But what will be your own cover? You know what, if you are concerned with your father, just bring it to us. I'll take it to him. Here I was lying, trying to keep stay clear from the Japanese. Something tickled me on the back. I dared not move. All I could do was roll my eyes. I may even have closed them. A cobra, one foot thick was crawling there. The creature was poised to attack. Action was needed now, so I stabbed the cobra with my dagger. It went for my head. No Japs in sight at that moment. - It just set me back. - And then what did you do? Then I ... What did you do about the cobra bite to your head? I was wearing a helmet. That saved me. And this wasn't the last time. So you still needed it. - What about your mustache? - Here we can make jokes about it. - I would immediately cut off my mustache if I had one. - Up yours, mr. Hitler! But we have a guest. He is a beautiful young man. You came to see your dad? Come closer. Fish for the gentlemen. Chub, tench, barbel trout and what not? I was on the river, not the creek. - And what about eels? - You give bloat. Here to Franco. - Udime is acacia wood. - You can't tell the difference. - We have a visitor. - Our youngest. Come over here. From now on this is your uncle Prošek. - What do you want? - Mommy ... - Mommy told me it is complete paradise out there. And we stay here. - Special shape. - Why? - These hooks are manufactured in the USA. The narrower the better. - Ouch, that hurts. - Eel are mysterious fish. Unpredictable. They hunt in the moonlight. This soil yields worms. I use them as bait. There are so many of them. Aah, got it. It tried to escape, but we've got it. Isn't this delicious? We need more. We have to move the soil ... ... to resist any eel. They are going after is the bottom. Sometimes they are swallowed. Sometimes not a single worm is left. Look how it is trembling. Come all into the box. As I said, eel is a mysterious fish. It has the finest meat. It is best smoked, but you can prepare in 72 ways. They serve it on silver. Kings get it on gold, but they gladly pay for it with gold. Do you notice its colours? It is a common minnow. These are the eel's prey. One movement and they've had it. Did you see that? Trout! You could catch them with bare hands. - Daddy, take me to the eel. - You're still too small. I'll make them a feast. What I really need is a long rope. - When will your brothers returned from playing football? - Not until the evening. If you bring me the rope, I'll take you to the eels. You'll find it just there. - D'you want something? - No, nothing. I can think of something you want. Are you hungry? Lunch is in a minute. - Can I at least have a slice of bread? - But don't let it spoil your appetite. Thank you. That's it. Well done. Now let's go to the river. - It's raining cats and dogs. - Beautiful, as what we need. Have you seen a washing line? Mom, this is no time to worry about such trifle things. It is eel time. Come with us. - Will you? - It's raining too much. - But not forever. - Daddy, the water is rising. - That is correct. The rain brought ... ... swarmss of insects. Fish have a priority now: stuffing your stomach. Do you hear that? Our golden eels are coming out. Just waiting for us. It's a beautiful night. Let's do it. - Take off your clothes. - Why? - Do not ask. You wanted to come with me. So undress. Take the stone into the river. When the rope is tight, drop it to the bottom. Not too fast. Easy now. - Daddy, the water is getting deeper. - Don't worry, go on. That's my boy. Go. Just a bit further. Just a bit. Two, three steps. - Daddy! - Don't let go! Hold the line! You're safe now. This is my biggest catch ever. What has come in to you? The boy might catch pneumonia. - He could have drowned. - I saved him. - And you can't even swim? - I had your washing line. You risked his life? Look at him. A father of three. Next time go into the water yourself. Drown yourself. Stop this silly game. It was a pretty good night, but maybe it was not the right night. There really was too much water. - But next time we'll do better. - Daddy, will the golden eels arrive? Definitely. Just you wait and see. We'll catch a whole bunch of them. Ouch. - Are you ready? - Yes. - We have no bait for the fish. - Can't uncle come with us? - He's not feeling well. Well, let's go. Daddy, Daddy. - Stay with your mom. - You heard your father. Shut up, stupid dog. - What ails you? - It's an old shrapnel wound from the war. Don't be angry. Here you go. Good dog. You like fish? Take it. So drink. Cough. Now come with me. Look, I kept it for you. It's from the willow tree. Let's go and catch some. Be quiet! Gotcha! Ouch. You're mine. I'm proud of you. - This is a nice one. Who put it there? - Uncle Prošek. - Who caught it? - Uncle Prošek no doubt. - Who? - I did. - Don't lie. Wow. - Good day, mr. Janouch. - Have you seen Prošek. - I caught a fish. - How big? - Look. Smallish. Apart from the bone it is very little. Let's see our new fisherman. - Where's my bass? - It's not there? - You stole it! - Maybe the wind blew it away. - Or it was eaten by a cat. The dirty rat! - Come on, it wasn't eaten by the cat. - Where is it? - Prošek took it. - It's not true. - It is. It started to smell, like your self-praise. [SUNG:] The two rocks were tramps, that had nothing to do ... ... but playing the guitar. - This will do. - Here, here, too. - Let us use this wire. - Because the normal line ... Barbel usually break them. They are the fiercest. They fight like lions. You made an error and it will cost you dear. Got it! Show it drop! Leave him! Leave him! - Let go a little and now pull! - It is getting away. Come up a bit, a little more. Allow a bit slack, go against the water. Give me the landing net. Come here. And it's yours. - I'm sorry. - Grab it firmly with both hands. - It will pay for the mistakes in its final battle. - Will it hurt? Not any longer, it gave its all in the battle. You won. It knows that it lost. Now be brave. You're here. How cold you are and slippery. I wonder how I can get you. You're there. You're still there. If you made a mistake ... ... you will have to pay for it. [RADIO:] Summer returns, a time full of desire, a time full of longing ... ... and sunny days, yet full of distress and dubious dreams. I brought you something. How sweet, but you should have left it there. It's still a baby. Marching through the rustic forest, fate swiftly approaches ... Look. - What funny stones. - It's not rock, those are mushrooms. - Why are you crying, Mom? - Masses of mushrooms predict war. Old wives' tales. Your grandmother said this before World War II. There were thousands ... ... of white mushrooms. And soon there was misery and hunger. Who is there? Prošek, look what has become of us. At least we still have this house. Grandmother was right. This is from the pub. This from Janouch. Prošek, you didn't poach, did you? What if you are caught ... Roe will strengthen the body It will last a long time. - Oh, Prošek what am I to do? - Whose bike is this? - Uncle! - What fish did you bring? - Just a carp. - Carp are good. - But there are patrolmen watching. And German soldiers. Dad and my brothers had to run. I would go as well, But apparently I'm too small. I want daddy to catch eels. That is my favourite fish. Uncle, take me with you. Ok, but not a word to your dad. - Uncle, do you use a cord? - What? - For the bait. - I don't, it's stupid. - But, dad ... - All manuals will tell you so. I will help you pull. - They will come one after another. And when they do ... - We'll pull! We might catch two or three solitary eels today. Here are some worms for you. You had better bite ... ... I know you can't resist them. Eels, wake up and come. It's a mysterious fish. I like to feast in the moonlight. Dad. I already have one! You are there, you can't fool me. I can see you, fish! Do you have a feast. Come to a set table. Two! We will win. Dam up the river. We will make them a barrier of bait. Make sure you stay in sight. Daddy! - You must go home. - I did not sleep, I have two eels. - And maybe a third. And this one makes three. - Three is enough. - Daddy said it was toward your timber. That's right. Acacia wood is excellent but expensive. Three eels would not pay for it. Frantisek, do not be greedy. Give me my acacia. This lot is worth 10 oxen. Do you know where is his dad is? - So, what we have today? - We have venison in red wine and cream. Venison? They don't even serve that in the Crystal Palace hotel in London. - Dad, I have an appetizer. - Let's see it. What will it be? Sausages with onion? - Did you catch them yourself? - Yes. - What a smell. - Pretty golden. - Not quite. Will you ever go for the golden eel? - Daddy. - So, hooray to them. The finest piece of meat. Frantisek is a jerk, it is much too salty. Mommy, what about the venison? They are no good. It's that stupid Janouch. - Go away! - We are going tomorrow. Come on, we'll help you. Daddy! - I've grown, I want to go with you. - That would leave your mother alone. - Couldn't we all go? - Women are not allowed where we are going. Someone has to sacrifice and stay with mother. - Take care of her. Will you promise me that? - Yes. Go away, off with you! What are you concealing? Wodka perhaps? What do you have up your sleeve? Is that a spoon you are hiding? Sure enough, it has to be a spoon. Lord God, help me. Mr. Oplt, you too help me. When my grandfather got married, he was very generous to you. Amen. - Dinner time. - No sweat, I'm coming. I got you! You villain, stop! Halt, or I ... Tycho. Silence! Where is he? Did you see him? - Tomorrow I'll be back with gendarmes. - Guard the fish well. - They are beautiful. Where were you? - Mr. Oplt gave them to me. This one I'll swap for flour, and this one for lard. - And we'll roast the fat one. - And let's send something to my brothers. So they came from mr. Oplt? You could have been seen from the castle. Gendarmes, fish guard. Who knows how many have seen you. - Nobody. - At least now I do not lie. You know what I can do? I'm hiding a man the Germans are looking for. So he can take revenge for his misfortune. You must promise me that you won't go see him. Promise me. You're taking a big risk. I only have you. Is anybody there? Don't go there. I got you, you rascal! I'll teach you! Scream! I'll punish you, you villain! Now cry, or do you want me to really hit you? - Aaaaaa! - That's better. - I will kill you. - Mr. fish guard, that's enough. - Leave it. - Mind your own business. - Aaaaaaaaaa! - You can stop now. Do you write to your father and brothers? - Could you send them something? - Yes. What were you thinking? A nice spot for carp, where everyone can see me? When there are so many better places on the other side, Do your fishing in the morning, when everyone is still in bed. Now go home and don't forget to limp. And make some aromatic dough ... ... Carp like that and bite quickly. - You did not listen to me? - I brought you ... - What was I saying? - We need it. - The fish guard could hurt you. - I promised dad nothing will happen. - I promised him. - Thou shalt obey! - And I will not! - What did you say? Do you think I don't know where they are? They are in the camp and they are hungry. They need to eat in order not to die. It's for them that I caught the carp. Even if they kill me. Boy. - Mommy, is there a heaven? - Why do you ask? - The boys in school said so. - It's not true. Certainly not. So send this to daddy. And this dream that we have. My little ones, brave fishermen. - Where were you? - At school. - I was there. - They released us home, Prihoda did not come. - Why? - Lidice's little one. - What did they tell you? - Just to go home. - But you did not go. - We went to see the creek. - Which one? - The one that flows from Lidice. The creek is drying up. We wanted know why. We went upstream. But a farmer chased us, shouting at us that the stream will not flow ... ... because he blew the pond into the air. Such bullshit. - What is the matter, mom? - Please go to uncle Prošek ... and stay there. - We could go fishing for barbel. - We're not going anywhere. - I could go on my own. - There are no barbel around. - Bass then?. - Come and sit here. Quiet, I'm going to fish. - Let me see, young man. - Bravo. Down! - Halt! Closed! - I'm ... - Away with you, go! - I brought you some trout. - Thank you. That's not the paratrooper? And what's this? A walkie-talkie. Stop, stop! - Where are they taking him? - Where? Well, what about you? Take her away! And what about the stench? - He's mine. - Who is that? - A drunken fool. A harmless man. Like some fish? Then drink. Ouch. This is a good day for fishing eel. I have everything prepared, You can catch a full trough there. Definitely biting. They respond! Stretch! These are the golden eels! Golden eels certainly arrive. I saw them ... ... These are splendid. They come from everywhere. You were right, daddy. These are your golden eels. Go, sail! Navigate to the sea.
