What did he say? We are going to the Magic Kingdom... You said you booked a hotel at the Magic Kingdom. That everything was taken care of. What is this, we are not even on Disney property. Shit. Joao booked it for me. I don't know. You had your assistant book our honeymoon hotel? What are these stray children rummaging about? This is a welfare, slum motel. We're spending our honeymoon in a gypsy project? Find another place. Check the Polynesian first. Or the Grand Floridian. This is their independence holiday. The resorts are booked. I'm not staying here.
