Subtitles by explosiveskull [curious music] [bird cawing] [Mary] My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am 18 years old, and I live with my sister, Constance. She is the most precious person in the world. The Blackwoods have always lived in this house. We have never done anything to hurt anyone. We put things back where they belong. And we will never leave here. No matter what they say... or what they do to us. Never. But a change is coming. And nobody knows it but me. [music continues] [weathervane creaks] [birds singing] [man on record] I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl. The secret mischiefs that I set abroach I lay unto the grievous charge of others. Clarence, whom I indeed have cast in darkness, I do beweep to many simple gulls, namely, to Darby, Hastings, Buckingham, and tell them 'tis the queen and her allies that stir the king against the duke, my brother. Now they believe it, and with all whet me to be revenged on Rivers, Dorset, Grey. But then I sigh, and, with a piece of scripture, tell them that God bids us do good for evil. - [Constance] Merricat! - And thus I clothe my naked villainy - with odd old ends stolen forth of Holy Writ... - [meows] - ...and seem a saint... - Merricat! - when most I play the devil. - Merricat, come on! [Constance] Please, wash your hands. What are you reading? A pretty sight, a lady with a book. I'm reading something called The Best Practice Guide to Canning, Uncle Julian. [Julian] Admirable. I don't seem to have any information on whether your father took - his cigar in the garden that morning. - He did. - He always did in the morning. - I should begin the chapter with that. "I won't have it." I heard your mother say that. Your father said, "We have no choice. I mean it." End quote. - Here's the list. - Mr. Elbert doesn't like big bills. - All right now. - The coins are better. You'll go to the town. You'll check out our books and records. You'll buy our groceries - and you'll be back in time for lunch. - Do I have to...? Lock the door. [curious music] [Mary] Tuesday is the most terrible day. Because Tuesday I must go to town and see all of those who hate us. I read in my book of spells that if you bury something evil or touched by cruelty you may take its power and you cannot be harmed for one whole day. [speaks spell softly] Protect me. We live at the end of Blackwood Road, which runs in a great circle around the village. Father, like all the Blackwoods before him, was very rich. And he built this gate to keep us safe. But it could not protect him. People here believe that six years ago Constance killed Father and our family and poisoned Uncle Julian. They think she is wicked and should be sent away. But now we live as two queens in a castle on top of the highest hill. You eat rats! [chattering] They wish for our ruin. But they don't understand. - [item thuds] - [man] A rack of lamb. Eggs. Coffee. Flour. - Walnuts. - Thomas. Peanut brittle. Thomas, stop it! Anything else? [bell tolls] Good morning, Merricat. How are you today? Fine, thank you. - Black coffee, please. - Sure. [doorbell jingles] [man] Hey, Stella! [Stella] Gentlemen. - [Mary] As soon as I heard his voice... - Where's the fire? Yeah, it's practice drills this morning, ladies. ...I knew my spell of protection had been broken. Lady. Long ago, Jim Donnell fell in love with my sister, Constance. He wanted to steal her away from us in his automobile. But I told Father. So... And Father was powerful ...they tell me you're moving away. ...so Jim Donnell lost his job and his love. And then his automobile. They tell me you're moving away. No. No? Must've just been gossip. Did you ever hear anything like the gossip in this town, Stella? Leave her alone, Jim. I'm not bothering anybody, Stell. I'm just asking Miss Mary Katherine Blackwood here how it is that everybody in town is telling me her and her sister are going somewhere else to live. Hmm? Yeah. It's a pity when the old families go. Though I guess you could say... most of the Blackwoods are gone already. Well, I can always tell people that, you know, I knew Constance Blackwood. I knew her real well. Did they ever do anything to you, Bobby? I could tell people, I fixed their broken step once and never got paid for it. Well, that must've been an oversight, Bobby. I tell you what, now that John Blackwood's gone, you can march right through the gate and see her. [laughs] She'll see you get what's coming to you. [whispers] Didn't fix it. Excuse me? Father said shoddy work should be punished, not paid for. Is that so? [bell tolls] [Jim] Go away. Maybe you should run along home now. They'll be no peace around here till you do. [Bobby] You got that right. Now, you just say the word, Ms. Mary Katherine Blackwood, and we'll come up there and we'll help you pack. Free of charge! [tolling continues] [eerie music] Merricat. Merricat. [young boy] Where's old Connie, home cooking dinner? "Merricat," said Connie, "would you like a cup of tea?" [younger boy] "Oh no," said Merricat, "you'll poison me." [older boy] "Merricat," said Connie, "would you like to go to sleep? Down in the boneyard ten feet deep!" - Kids! - [older boy] Bye, stupid! My mom says you and Constance eat rats. Go home, you witch! [panting] [Constance] Merricat. Look how far I came today. Next thing you know, I'll be following you into town. You wouldn't like it very much. Tonight, I believe I will commence Chapter 44. I will begin with a slight exaggeration and from there go on into an outright... lie. Constance, my dear? Yes, Uncle Julian? I am going to say that my wife was beautiful. [gentle music] I'm always happy when you come home from the village. Yes, you bring me food... but also I miss you. I'm always happy to get back. How was it in town today? I'm getting better. I went so far down the lawn today. Someday I'll go. I'll take you to the moon. It's beautiful there. We will be picking lettuces soon. The weather has stayed so warm. On the moon, you have lettuce all year round, yes? On the moon we have everything. The locks are solid and tight. It's just you and me. And the sun would shine every day. [sighs] The world is full of terrible people. [Mary] Constance believes in the goodness of people. Nothing bad will happen, Merricat. I promise. [door hinges squeak] - [whistling, song begins] - [door shuts] [song continues] [singing in Italian from record player] [muffled song continues] [Constance speaks Italian] [Mary] A new wickedness is coming, I feel it, so I cast a spell of strong protection. I bury another silver coin along with a doll Father gave Constance whose eyes can never shut. I nail the book Father gave me to the pine tree. As long as they remain in place, Constance will be safe. - [song ends abruptly] - [birds chirping} She's brought someone else. Are you frightened? No. I'll send them away. Answer the door. Good afternoon, Mary Katherine. I brought Lucille Wright. You remember her? And Mr. Clarke, of course. Goodbye, dear. I'll come pick you girls up in an hour. Goodbye, Mary Katherine... Oh, Helen, the staircase. Oregonian pine. Shame. Nobody sees it anymore. [Constance] Tea? [Helen] The garden looks beautiful, Constance. I do so love a garden. I do. This year we raised $600 at the Friends of Miss Porter's Iris Contest. Six hundred dollars! An iris contest this early? Adrian Whittle won with her plum iris. You could have beat her to a pulp with your Night Ruler, Constance. You're missing so much. [whispers] So much. [Helen] I care about you, dear. Your mother and I were such... It's spring. You're young. You're lovely. You have a right to be happy. Come back to the world, dear. We've forgotten the milk. Thank you, dear. I mean, not too much at first. That would look odd. - [Lucille] Or, perhaps dinner. - [Helen] Dinner. [Mary] Make Constance stay. Make Constance stay. Make Constance stay. [crashes] I'll think about it. [Mary] No one will come here. They're too afraid. [Helen] Good heavens, Mary Katherine. - They hate us. - Nonsense. I don't listen to their gossip, and neither should you. People will gossip. Father used to say the townspeople were lazy animals. - Trash. - Rum cake? [Mary] He said if they only worked a little harder they could have a castle too, and then they could grow things like stores and roads - and beautiful gardens. - Do you really suppose people are afraid to visit here? [Julian] Afraid to visit here? My niece was acquitted of murder. There could be no possible danger in visiting here now. Julian Blackwood. Hello. Lucille Wright. - Hello, Julian. - [Julian] Though one could say there's danger everywhere. Danger of poison, certainly. My niece, Constance, could tell you of the most unlikely of perils, garden plants more deadly than snakes, and simple herbs that slash like knives through the lining of your belly, madam. That's all been forgotten. No one ever thinks about it anymore. A most fascinating case, one of the true genuine mysteries of our time, of my... time, particularly. And I survived to tell the story. I followed the trial... Julian, there is such a thing as good taste. Taste, madam? Have you ever tasted arsenic? You mean you remember? A family gathering for the evening meal. Never supposed to be the last. The dining room? Just a glance? Lucille! Lucille! I used that sugar myself on my blackberries. Luckily, fate intervened. Some of us, that day, she led inexorably through the gates of death. [Julian] I took very little sugar. I told her not to mention it. I swear I did. Constance, I swear. I wouldn't have brought her here. My brother, John, at the table that night. And you will notice my sister-in-law, who was, madam, a delicate woman, a woman born for tragedy. And the girls. Yes. Constance. Merricat... was not at the table that night. A great child of 12, sent to bed without her supper. I remember the meal perfectly. Spring lamb roasted with mint jelly... But the blackberries were the important part. I can see that you are about to ask why she should conceivably have used arsenic when she can put her hand upon a bewildering array of deadly substances without ever leaving home. But she bought the arsenic, - [Lucille] she told them. - To kill rats. [Lucille] Why? Why did she do it? Unless, of course, she's some sort of homicidal maniac or a mass murderer. [Julian] Why? She was let off by the jury. Too pretty and well-bred to be locked up forever. But she told the police it was her fault, that they deserved to die. I deserve to die. We all do, don't we? [car horn honks] - Don't we? - [Helen] Lucille. We're leaving. - I told you not to mention it! - [Lucille] I'm sorry. - I know. I know, but... - Didn't I tell you?! - [Lucille] I didn't know that he was going to... - [car door shuts] You stupid bitch. Constance, how was I? Charming, Uncle Julian. You didn't need your notes at all. It did happen, didn't it? Yes, it did. If I'm spared the time, I will write the book. If not, please see to it that my notes are entrusted to some worthy cynic who will not be too concerned with the truth. [eerie piano music] [wind howling] [Mary] Father? [Constance] What are you doing? [Mary] I heard Father in his room. They're gone. I feel him coming back. [pencil scratching] Merricat! I need you to go to town. It's not my day to go. We're out of sugar. I want to make a rhubarb pie. I dislike rhubarb. But it has the prettiest colors of all. Nothing looks so beautiful on the shelves as rhubarb jam. Make it for the shelves, then. Here are the coins. But it's not my day. You'll be back in time for lunch. [Mary] I didn't know I would be going to town. Lock the door behind me. - [bell rings] - [Mary] Sugar. I had no time to check my safeguards. The house would not be secure. [man] Nothing but trouble. If I would have known I needed to go today... - Whoa! - ...a Thursday... Hey, Mary Katherine, where are you going all dressed up? ...I would've checked my coins. And my doll. And I would have checked Father's book was firm on the tree. [gasps] There you are. Constance, Father's book has fallen from the tree. It's our cousin, Charles Blackwood. I knew him at once. He looks just like Father. [Charles] It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Mary. Got a hug for your cousin? [Constance] Merricat, he's come to see us. [ominous music] [panting] [whippoorwill sings] [Julian] "I won't have it." End quote. - [meows] - "And I listened at the door... [Julian continues] of course... as they quarreled hatefully." You slept in your garden on the moon, didn't you? I didn't come in in time to hear what they were quarrelling about. Silly Merricat. [Mary] Uncle Julian doesn't like your omelets anymore? The fruit is for Charles. - [Charles] Morning. - [cat hissing] [Charles] Oh! Uh... Oh, it's okay. I've got it, Charles. [meows] Good morning, Cousin Mary. - Shy? - [Constance laughs] We don't see a lot of strangers. Mmm. Now that's a handsome cat. What's his name? Jonas. Jonas? Jonas? Is he your special pet? - Yes. - [Jonas meows gently] Well, we're going to be very good friends, you, Jonas and I. [Julian] Charles. [Mary] I see Uncle Julian and Constance light up for him. His presence is a strange new spell. - Are those pancakes? - I am powerless before it. It's been a long time since anyone's made me pancakes. - Delicious. - But he came unbidden, and I will drive him away. Your, uh... great, uh, great-grandfather... planted those trees over there. [Charles] Hmm. They're really nice. A little crooked. Should we...? Oh, that's all right. I... need my exercise. Don't tidy Father's room this morning. Charles is staying there. [exhales] [gentle music] [Charles] But Venice is my favorite. You lose yourself in a maze of beauty. Canals of singing gondolieri and narrow streets where every corner looks the same. But, what is most chilling is that when you walk, your footsteps echo behind you, and you think that someone's following you. Your shoes are loud on the cobblestones, and when you stop, it sounds as though someone else has stopped. But, I suppose, if you had someone walking with you, if you were not alone, then it wouldn't really matter if you were being followed or not. I've never been anywhere. Too bad. Why is that? Father said everything that mattered was in America. Uncle Julian, here's a biscuit. Eat the soft side. Constance, do you think I should begin Chapter 45 with: "It was a fine morning, a bright fine morning, but none of them knew it was their last." Uncle Julian, do we need to discuss that right now? It was so long ago. That chair is my dead brother's chair. That last time I saw him there he was foaming at the mouth. Can it all just be forgotten? - Forgotten? - [Charles] We don't want to talk about that bad time. Okay? I believe that you are speaking slightingly of my life's work. Sit down, Constance. Why don't we tuck in your napkin here or you're gonna mess yourself, buddy. You're missing a button, Charles. I'll sew it for you. Oh. I, uh, noticed this morning there was a broken step out back. How about I fix it for you? That would be very kind of you. And I could also go to the village and pick up whatever you need... I go to the village on Tuesdays. - You do? - But I worry about you. I'll give you a list, Charles, and some money and you shall be the grocery boy. [Charles] You keep money in the house? Father didn't trust the banking system. It's all in the safe. Amanita phalloides contains three poisons. Mushroom Amanitin, which is slow but potent. Phalloidin, which attacks the liver and kidneys. - [Julian] John... - And Phallin, - which dissolves red corpuscles although it is the least potent. - [Julian] John... I taught her all the deadly ones so she won't eat them. The first symptoms do not appear until seven to 12 hours after eating. John, I'm telling you, investments aren't what they were when father made his money. - [Mary] Or even 40 hours. - But he knew times change. - Who's he talking to? - Cold sweat. Oh, he thinks you're his brother, John. - Vomiting. - Times change. - All right. Enough. - Vomiting. Vomiting. Do you think I should begin Chapter 45 with, "It was a fine morning, a bright fine morning, and no one knew it was their last." [Constance] There you are, dear. Constance, he should be in the hospital. I'm going to get you a sherry. [Julian] Do you know what it's like to be poisoned and live? No. [Julian] Hmm. It's... It's terrible... to lie here waiting to die. Please, don't touch my papers. [eerie music] [birds chirping] [Mary] May I have my lunch? There you are. I think I'll wait to have my lunch with Charles. I'm making gingerbread for him. [Mary] I am beginning to think my spells no longer work. No matter how many things of Father's I bury, I cannot protect Constance or make Charles go. Our land is beginning to fill with them. This web of terrible things. I will need stronger magic to keep us safe. [Charles] Hey. What are you doing over there? Oh... You're planting too deep. Let me show you how you do that. Gotta use two fingers, all right? See? Constance? Constance? Yes, Charles? What the heck is she doing? She's gardening. Connie, th... this thing is made of gold. That's my dead brother's gold watch. - I thought he was buried in it. - It's not important. [Charles] Not important? Well... The hell of a way to treat a valuable thing. Nobody wants it. You could've... You could've sold it. I certainly did think he was buried in it. It's worth money. It's probably worth a great deal of money. Sensible people don't go burying valuable things. - [scoffs] - Charles. [Charles stammers] Yes? You look very flushed. [chuckles] I... It's gold. Are you hot? Maybe. Would you like a bath? [whistling] [footsteps approaching] I was just leaving a towel. [Mary] Constance... has he said anything about leaving? He's our cousin, and he's decided to come visit us, and he will go when he is ready. [footsteps approaching] Cousin Charles. Cousin Charles. [clears throat] Well? I've decided to ask you, nicely, to please go away. All right. You asked me. Please, will you go away? Cousin Mary doesn't like me. Here I've come to... see my two dear cousins and my old uncle who I haven't seen in years, and... Cousin Mary won't even be polite to me. Well... Constance likes me. That's all that matters. [mid-tempo song plays on piano] [Constance's piano playing continues] [Mary] I try to find the right words to expel him... [Charles] Constance! ...but his power is strong. [Charles] Constance! Constance, will you make Uncle Julian a little soft cake for his lunch... Constance is busy now. Run along and play. - I'm sorry. - But Uncle Julian's going to... She's busy right now. Your sister works like a slave. He wears Father's suit, sleeps in Father's bed, smokes his pipe, and glides his tonic all over his hair. And Constance does not see it. [chattering] She obliges him and pretends he is not like Father. And now she frowns at me... I love you, Constance. ...as though I'm the one who is different. I'm so tired. [hammering] Constance? - [Julian] I cannot work in here... - [Charles] Constance? ...if Charles is going to talk all the time. - This is too much. - What now? Have you ever seen anything like this? Look at it, Connie. Look at it. Look at it. I suppose it belongs to Merricat. It doesn't belong to Merricat or anything like it. This is money. There are 40 silver coins in here, Connie. This is outrageous. She likes to bury things. She has no right to bury things. [Charles] This is terrible. - She has no right. - No harm is done. It's fine. How do you know there isn't more? How do you know that crazy kid hasn't buried 40,000 coins around here we'll never find? Goddamn kid. How's the step coming? [Charles] I need more nails. Here. Just take some of these. - And if that's not enough... - Con... Constance. ...you can just charge it to our account. Th... Constance. Con... Hey, I can buy half the market with this. You shouldn't keep that much money in the house. And you should have a phone. It became troublesome. Thank you for fixing the step.

Well, well, well. - Everybody's here. - Charles! Oh, Connie. I was thinking, while I'm here, I should go through your father's papers. Don't touch my papers!

The Cicuta maculata is the water hemlock, one of the most poisonous of wild plants if taken internally. The Apocynum cannabinum is not a poisonous... Stop it! May I have my lunch, Constance? - Of course. - Constance... But first you have to explain to Cousin Charles. Please don't be angry, Charles. I'll clean your room right away. - [Charles] Mary Katherine! - [Julian muttering] I'm gonna give you one last chance to explain. Why did you make a mess in my room? I cannot work in here if Charles is going to talk all the time. This is none of your business. Answer me. [Julian] John, how often must I tell you, I know nothing about it and it is none of my concern. - My name is Charles. - It is a quarrel between the women - and it is none of my affair. - May I have my lunch, Constance? - Of course. - I do not involve myself in my wife's petty squabbles... - Shut up! Please. - I'd advise you to do the same. Constance, the sooner you're out of here the better. I will not be told to shut up by my own brother! We will leave your house, John, if that is really your desire. I will ask you, however, to reflect. Charles, when are you leaving? I'm not leaving. - I'm staying. No! - This is all my fault. All of this is my fault. - This is a crazy house. - You stay away from my papers! - Uncle Julian... - You keep away from my papers, you bastard! My dear, I apologize to use such a word. It is merely a word used among men to categorize an undesirable fellow! I tell you I've had enough of this. You have forgotten yourself, to take such a tone to me! Please be extremely quiet now. Not until I am done with Mary Katherine. My niece, Mary Katherine, died in an orphanage of neglect, during her sister's trial for murder. But she is of very little consequence to my book... She's sitting right here. Enough! You must either be quiet or you must leave this room. - This is a mad house. - You look very tired. You should go rest until lunch. I'm not going anywhere until something is done about this girl. Why should anything be done? I said I would clean your room. Constance, why aren't you going to punish her? Punish me? Punish me? You mean send me to my bed without my dinner? You are a very selfish man, John. Stop it, Julian! It is not fitting for men of dignity to reproach... - Please... - ...threaten when women have had a falling out. - Shut up! Stop it! - You lose stature, John. You lose stature. - Stop it! - You lose stature, John. - Not another word, please. - You lose stature! You lose stature, John! - You lose stature! - Do you hear me, Julian! You're a ghost and a demon! Merricat, enough, okay?! You are making it worse. - [voices begin to fade out] - [Charles] Answer me! - [eerie music] - [Constance] Stop it! Stop, Merricat, please! Answer me. [panting] [Mary] Some terrible force has brought everything I've ever buried to the surface, like the opposite of a spell. What could be the opposite of a spell? [deep exhale] A curse. [man] You should have a new book. Should Mary Katherine have a new book? She should have anything she wants. Our most loved daughter should have anything she likes. Mary Katherine... we love you. You must never be punished. You are to see to it that our most beloved daughter is never punished. [gentle music] [Jonas meows] [Julian] Chapter 36. "It was a beautiful meal." Here she is. Wash your face and your hands. Get ready for dinner. Cousin Charles is already angry with you. Your sister and I have had enough of your hiding and destroying and temper. We're going to have a long talk tonight after I enjoy the beautiful meal that your sister made for me this afternoon. Run along, Merricat. Your dinner will be cold. Let me ask you a question, Mary. Why don't you like me? - [Constance] Oh, Charles. - No, it's okay. I'm just asking. Why don't you like me? She likes you. No... she doesn't. I think I know why. Lord knows I have my theories. But you never really never did give me a chance, did you, Mary? She likes you. I came here to offer assistance... and guidance. And from the look of things, I think I got here just in time, but... what did I get in return? Not even a thank you. Perhaps if John knew that it was their last day, he would have not begrudged my wife her sausage. [annoyed exhale] What took you so long? [chuckles] Forget it. Don't even say a word. I just want to enjoy this meal in peace. [quiet chuckle] - Amanita phalloides contains three poisons. - Don't. Mushroom Amanitin, which is slow but potent. - Enough! - Phalloidin, which attacks the liver and kidneys, and Phallin, which dissolves red corpuscles. I mean it. I won't stand for it. [Mary] The first symptoms do not appear - ...until seven to 12 hours... - Not another goddamned word! Constance? - [screams] - John... [continues screaming] [Charles] Get out there, goddamn it! - No. No. - [Mary muttering spell] [Charles grunting] [Constance whispers] No. No. No. No! [laughs] - No. No... - Father, stop! - No! - Be quiet! Shut up! - [Mary] What are you doing? - [Charles] Be quiet. Just shut up! Shut up! Shut up! - [Mary] Father, stop! - [Charles] Shut up! - Shut up! Shh! Shh! - [Mary whimpering] - [Charles] Shh! Shh! - [Mary sobs] Father, stop! No! [Charles] Be quiet and shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up. Shh... - [Mary sobs quietly] - [Charles] Shut up. [quietly] Shut up. [panting] [low roaring] What is that? What is that? [Mary sobs, speaks incoherently] [Charles] Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire, Constance. Grab a bag. Constance, quick. Hey, hey, hey. Grab the money out of the safe. Okay? Do you hear me? Constance, fire! [panting] I'm gonna get help. [honking while driving] [continues honking] [dog barking] - [faint horn honking rapidly] - [Stella whispers] Fire. Fire! Fire in the Blackwood House! - [Constance sobs] - [Mary speaks spell softly] [panting] [flames sizzle] We just cleaned it. - Constance... - It has no right to burn. [continues honking] [Constance coughing] [fire engines approaching] Uncle Julian. [Constance] Uncle Julian! Uncle Julian, open the door. [knocking] Uncle Julian, open the door. [Jim] Clear the house. Do you hear me? Clear the house! - [gasps] - [panting] [coughing] Throw up that bottom line and get up in the tanks. That's a fire, all right. Oh yeah, that's a fire. [crowd murmurs] Why not let it burn, Jim? Now, Bobby, you know sure well we can't let this fine manor fall. We're firemen. We gotta put it out. [indistinct shouting] Move it, move it! Everyone out! Clear the house. [faint shouting] Clear the room! [Jim] Let's go! Let's go! - [man] Come on! - Let's go! Water! - [man] The hallway! - [firemen chattering] Water! [man] We need more water! [crowd chattering continues] [man] We should have burned it down years ago! Let it burn! Let it burn! Let it burn! [crowd chants] Let it burn! Let it burn! Let it burn! Let it burn! "Merricat," said Connie, "would you like a cup of tea?" "Oh no," said Merricat, "you'll poison me." - [chanting continues] - Let it burn! [boys taunting] Merricat. Merricat. [crowd cheers] [Mary] The sound of their hate is another kind of fire moving through the bones of our house. I know now that all of my spells are broken. What was buried here in this village, their want for our ruin, has come to the surface at last. [man] Where are the girls? Fire's all out, folks. [woman] Should have just let that fire burn, Jim. [man] Should've burned down years ago. [man 2] Now what do we do, Jim? [man 3] Crazy witches. [indistinct chatter] [panting] Constance, we have to go. What are you doing?! - [window shatters] - [crowd cheers] - [woman] Take it! Take everything! - We have to go outside. [crowd screaming angrily] - [grunts] - Get the money! [crowd shouting] Let's get some of that gold! [shouting continues] What the goddamn hell is going on here?! [Charles] Get out of here! Get out! [panting] [Woman] Don't forget the candlesticks! Go! [older boy] Merricat! [grunting] [older boy] Merricat! [younger boy] Merricat! Merricat! Stop it! - [mob shouting] - [Sam] You crazy, drunken fools! [Helen] Where are they?! What do we got here? [boys taunting] Merricat! Merricat! [man] Look who's here, the little debutante. [screams in fear] - [screams in anger] - Where're you going? - [screams] - [Mary] Constance! Sam! [all shouting] [mob chants] Burn! Burn! What are you doing? Leave them! [Stella] Stop it! Stop it! No! No! That's enough! Stop it! [Sam] That's enough! You listen to me! - Leave them alone! - Listen to me! - [extended honk] - [grunting] -[gunshot] [mob quiets down] [panting] Julian Blackwood is dead. There's been a death in this house. You get out of here! [Constance sobbing] Go on now! Get out of here! [both panting] [birds singing] [gasps] We're on the moon at last. [Constance] Uncle Julian. Poor Uncle Julian. Who will write his book? [footsteps approaching] [sighs] My kitchen. [Jonas meows] I'm going to put death in all their food and watch them die. Like you did before? I'm sorry. He was wicked. He was a very wicked man, our father. He was very wicked to me. I put it in the sugar. I know. I knew then. - You never use sugar. - No. No... no. That's why I put it in the sugar. [Constance] You saved me, my Merricat. We'll never talk about it again. Never. - Never again. - [knocking] [Helen] Constance? [knocking continues] Constance? [insistent knocking] It's Helen and Sam Clarke. Open the door, dear. Never again. Never. [whispers] Never... [Sam] Constance? I just thought you'd like to know that your Uncle Julian's funeral is the day after tomorrow. There's a lot of flowers already. I think you'd be very impressed if you could see all the flowers we all sent Julian. We're your friends, dear. You shouldn't drive away your friends. Constance, everything's fine. We're going to forget all about it. In a few weeks, no one will even remember what happened. [water dripping] Sam, break down the door. No. Every window's already broken in the place already, Helen. I'm not gonna break anything else, for Christ's sake. Then climb in a window, for God's sakes. No. Look, leave them. They'll come out when they're ready. They're not children. We can't go upstairs. [pounding on door] [Ned] Hey, Miss Constance? Hey, Miss Constance? I... I got a chicken here. My wife roasted it up nice. [stammers] And there's some cookies and pie. I hope you can hear me. I, uh... I broke one of your chairs. I'm-I'm sorry. [stammers] I'll just leave it here. Sorry again. Do you think it's as good as my pies? - [hammering] - [Constance] Leave it, Merricat. Let some sun in. [knocking] More food. We're the biggest church supper they ever had. [insistent knocking] [Charles] Connie? I'm back. Constance? [Charles] Darling. Let's forget all that ever happened. I want to be friends again. Will you open the door? Connie, I didn't mean for that to happen. I didn't. I'm sorry. I can help you, Connie. I can. We can have a life together, away from here. Don't you want that, Connie? Italy. Remember how that felt? Remember... when I held you? Connie... Please, you have to open the door. You understand? I can't help you if you don't let me. Do you hear me, Connie? I can't help you if you don't let me. And I'm not going away. I'm not going away, Connie. - [jiggles door] - [groans] There will never be anyone like me, Connie. Who's gonna love you? Nobody. Nobody's gonna love you. Is that what you want, Connie? I don't deserve to be treated like this! [stammers] I could just walk away! I could! Is that what you want? I don't deserve this! I don't deserve this! I don't deserve to be treated like this! I came here to help you! [pounding on door] [gasps] - Hey! Connie! - No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! - Hey, Connie! - No! - No! No! No! No! - Connie! - [Constance screams] - [grunts] [body thuds] [panting] May I have my lunch, Constance? You can have whatever you want. [birds chirping] [curious music] My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am 18 years old, and I live with my sister, Constance. She is the most precious person in the world. The Blackwoods have always lived in this house. [man] Let's just put the bag down and get the hell out of here. We have never done anything to hurt anyone. Merricat. [younger boy] They're probably not even in there. Merricat! - We put things back where they belong. - [older boy] Merricat. Merricat! Merricat! - And we will never leave here. - [older boy] Merricat! Are you cooking up some stew? What's for dinner? Babies? I bet you like to eat babies! [younger boy] I heard you eat rats! You should have burned! - Baby rats! - Burned with all the rest of your things! Would you like a cup of tea, you rat witch! Come out and get us! You stupid bitch! [older boy screams] He didn't mean it! No matter what they say or what they do to us. Never. What will we have for lunch today? Rhubarb pie. I wonder if I could eat a child if I had the chance. I doubt that I could cook one. It must be terrible to be so afraid. I love you, Merricat. [slow instrumental music] Subtitles by explosiveskull
