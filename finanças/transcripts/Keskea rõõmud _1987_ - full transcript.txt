Why didn't you come yesterday? I already had it done. Stainless steel. - Put it here. Budge up, out of the way. in the film MID-LIFE DELIGHTS What was the house number? - Hold on, I'll check. Fedyuninski 40. Turn it up. Can one change oneself or is it all set in stone? While women come with problems before the divorce to see whether something could be done, many men have come... - Make a left here. ... who is at fault and whether they should blame themselves. We have noted that the average age is 36 for men and 34 for women. You said that men often come after the divorce. But shouldn't they come before? Hello! - Hello! - Good day! No, don't go. - What is its name? Taufa. - Taufa, yes... A boy... - No, it's a girl. Yes, a girl, we are currently on heat. Oh, we are on heat... Are all the unwell here? Let's get a move on! Now you'll find out all about yourself! - Get in. Hello. - Hello. Fill it up, 40 litres. - Grade 76, was it? Have you got any oil? - Should get some next week. Towards the end? - Yes, not before. Silva, give me some cash. Thanks. Pille Loorits, born on 29 January 1951. - Correct. Lived on this Earth 12,755 days. - 12,755? - Yes. Could just as well erase the last day because of that bastard. I don't get this. - Here's June, pluses here, minuses there. This here is the emotional state I is for intellectual. That's a state we don't have. - P is physical. - And S is sexual. That's another state we don't have. - Put your seatbelt on. - Done. Is Helena riding with them? - I guess so. You're having a non-day today. - My whole life is a non-day. Oh shut up. What would I do without you? Same as with me, only with someone else. - Silly you! God, how I love travelling. If it was possible, I would not do anything else. Kulli Meeta at our office recently went to Austria... - Australia. No doubt you know better where she went. The trip was expensive, but Austrian nature, mountains... - Australian. Please do shut up. Wish I could go to Paris, even once! What is it? Airport. Go on, go to Paris. By the way, it's in France. You know what, you're a bastard. Yes, everyone should visit Paris. But I'd like to go to Domrémy village. Where Joan of Arc was born. Did you know that Joan of Arc also had healing powers? - Like Nigul? I know she was 16 when Duke Charles of Lorraine sent for her. I wonder how she healed that Charles? She told Charles that he had to heal his soul and go back to his virtuous wife. As for me, I am fine and we could turn back and go home. But you are not the Duke of Lorraine. - Yes, I am a bastard. Please stop the car. I... Please let me out. You going to Paris as well? - I left my coat in Silva's car. Will you stop acting like a pig? What can Helena now think of us? You're the same with the child. That's why he no longer... - Why do you, women, whine all the time? What is wrong with you? No sense of humour whatsoever. Tell me, what is our life worth? I think I'm a pretty nice guy: funny, hardworking, nice to women. Silva! Silva, stop the car! What happened, miss? - Oh, nothing, everything is fine. Perhaps I can help? - Can I phone from the car? - Of course. We're going in such a big bunch, I'm not sure he'll even see us. Oh, he will. Everybody has always agreed to see me. What's with Helena, why is she coming? - No idea, but she did insist. A free single woman, does what she wants. Wouldn't you like to be free? No, believe it or not. - Why? I guess I still believe in you. Oh, here we go. - Just what we needed. - You be quiet. Give me the licence. Pull your feet back, they're always in the way. Militia lieutenant Kaseorg. Your documents, please. - Here you are. What's the matter? What is it? Have you not lost anything? We didn't tell her to get off, she wanted to. - She herself wanted. You be quiet, get in the car. Alright. Assaku station informed us that your acquaintance is there. Go and pick her up and be more careful in the future. You may go. Is everything alright? - Yes, just drive on. Hello, they are here... Yes... Yes. Very well, come here. Over. You will be picked up in a minute. - Really? Thank you. You don't believe me, but that's how it was. She was leading armies at 17. - I know, she was under-age. Her wits were so sharp that the entire committee was unable to confuse her with any canon law or theological question. But they interrogated her for three weeks. Old men were amazed at her spiritual education. - Yeah, yeah, But education is not everything. We here have seen such intellectuals that... Actually, it was not Joan of Arc's wits that saved France. - What then? Divine providence. What? - Divine providence. May I see your document? - Yes, I only have my work certificate. What happened back then was a miracle, but we are no longer able to believe it. At 13, she began hearing voices, and later, saints appeared to her. You work at the central library? - Yes, as a bibliographer-programmer. If you want, I could calculate your bio-periods. - What for? You will learn when you non-day is. - We do not have non-days here. What was Joan of Arc otherwise like? - She had a good figure and high bust. That's what historical documents say. - Are there no photos left of her? Thank you. That was Hubert Raud. - Who? It was a long time ago. When Hubert was drinking, a child was out of the question. And then we were verging on divorce. - Tõnu and me are still verging. Now it seems we're too late. Look, a cow. It is never late. Believe me, a child would fix everything. I no longer know whether it would or wouldn't. Well, Nigul should definitely be able to help you with that. I'd like your brother Hubert to help me with that. It went so swiftly for Tõnu and me. After tech school, I was training at the factory sanitarium diner. Middle-aged people with their kids - I could have died of boredom. The chef was practically the only single man. We even kissed with him. He smelt of vanilla. And the suddenly I thought, what if that is what I've been waiting for. But that night at the club I saw my Tõnu. Oh, he was tanned, hair sun-bleached, teeth white. And when he smiled... In spring, Evelin was born. Look, I brought a photo. Yes, Evelin is a pretty girl. Pretty, but terribly stubborn - hasn't talked to us for a week. Comes home, wraps herself up and gazes emptily at one spot. In love. - I don't think so. Nigul will tell what's wrong with her. I was like that in the ninth grade. It will pass, no need for Nigul. Well, Tõnu and me need Nigul. Hey, listen, don't be startled. - Dear god... I am Ott, a student from Tartu. I thought that such nice, humane-looking ladies. So I stepped in, to maybe get a lift with you to Tartu. We are going to Põltsamaa, so sod off right now. - Hold on. Very well, if you're patient, you can get to Tartu too. - I can? Is something coming out? - Yes. This is the simplest thing. I've got several more at home. Like a pipe. Start collecting them. At work, one guy collects old locks. We call him Carl Lock. I would then be Inhalator Hubert. - Carl Lock sounds better. - Yes. Carl once showed me a book of locks. Very funny. What exactly? - Chastity belts that were put on women when men went to war. Just put a lock on your wife when going on a business trip. But if you lose the key, you have to pick it or weld it open. There were fine locks in old days. Like the ones to lock prayer books - small like wild strawberries. Honestly, I would lock all the books. Why? - Too many smartasses have sprung up. One should first shovel for 8 hours, and then read, otherwise everyone has higher education, but no one can be bothered to work. Do you not read books? One must work, then there's no need for that crap. I work. - It's play, not work. You'd be the first I'd give a shovel to. - What about me? You I'd just lock. Do you know where the securest locks are? Here. I told you it is better with four. - Hello, aunt. - Hello. Hello. - Hello. Where is aunt Luise? - We buried her in early May. And so now we have a trio. Mother, I' in a hurry. - Heavens, you come here once a year... Edvin asked me to take Roy to Tartu. - Roy? - Yes. Roy, where are you? What are you laughing at? Who is this? A seagull. - Not. it's not. - A cuckoo. Correct. But who is this? - A pigeon. - A nightingale. A lark. - No, it's a nightingale. - Of course it's a nightingale. How about this one? - This bird is Yma Sumac. Tõnu... - No, it's a starling. A starling? - Yes, it sings, what it has heard in its childhood. A starling? - But who is this? So, a starling is a true polyglot. - Yes, something like you, can chirp everything about everything. Invite the others in as well, you could even have a cup of tea. I don't have much at home. We are performing at the culture house tonight. We're in a hurry. - Like always! You come once a year and then hurry. Hello, madam. Hubert, darling, hello. Glad to see you. - Roy, hello. Why do you always rush and hurry? And you've wasted away. We're going to Võru, to see Nigul. - The quack doctor? - Yes. What's wrong? - Nothing terrible, Hubert still gets asthma attacks. Come on, let's go then. - You're already going? Mum, where's the dog leash? - I'll get it. - Roy, let's go. That Nigul, he's world famous, he even heals great men in Moscow. Look: this is sirsasana, against indigestion. Don't hurt yourself. - No, I won't. Hello, children, you've arrived! Come inside, don't squat out here. Hello, darling. You've lost so much weight, that's not good. Wait, I'll take a picture of you. Roy, let's go on the picture. - All of you, gather in the centre. Not me, I'm not presentable. - Never mind, you look good. Attention, watch the birdie! Quick, get in the cars, let's leg it. I need to go to the department store. Is it far? - Bloody bedlam. We'll walk, come here. - Listen, next stop: department store. Did you hear? Come on girls, hurry. Come, let's go. God, how I'd love to live here. Tõnu wants to buy a farm, but I don't want to live out in the country. Would you like to live here? Own house, sauna, garden. - And mother-in-law. Do you not get on? - She is too musical for me. She divides people in two: those who can hold a tune and those who can't. But you can. - I'm the worst type. When she heard that I had quit music school for volleyball, she said that Silva shouldn't marry me. - Silva herself has quit most things. That's supposedly also my fault. We've been thinking with Tõnu. You should adopt, if Nigul can't help. Many people do it. - Don't stick your nose is other people's business. Perhaps we still want to see the world. - You and Silva have seen enough of it. If god let everyone see as much. - Perhaps it's not enough for us? You're too ambitious. - Your Tõnu has no scrap of ambition. That's what he is what he is. - What? - Primitive. Hey, you don't know where and how he grew up! - I don't want to know. Better an honest hick than a... Hubert! Wait up. Hubert! Do you have these boots in size 43? How about 44? - Sold out. I really need them, check under the counter. - I told you, sold out! Hello, Mare. - Hello, how are you? Long time, no see. Not bad. Listen... I'll check. - Oh, you have? Hello. What size? - 44. I'd like to try them on. - Over there. Excuse me, what are you doing? - Trying it on. But that's my boot. - No, it's not, yours is that one. No, it's mine. - Have you bought it? What's the problem? We'll be spreading manure in the country. I need exactly these green wellies. I've got a green coat, you've seen it, and green socks as well. How much do I owe you? - 65 roubles. The fat one, you sung together in Laine. - Ingeborg? - Yes, that one. Is it true she married a Finn? - No, it's not. But you still live with your husband? Someone said you sing at a restaurant and have remarried. No, I've not been singing for ages, I'm an administrator at Philharmonics. I travel around and... - And look at me, so settled. Hello? Why is it the other way round with birds? Males are prettier than females. Females have other things to do, they have to lay and hatch eggs. Males have secondary roles, that's why they try to stand out, crow and beat their wings. - Easy for birds, they have feathers. Nature has everything, open your beak and swallow... Damn, this'll take awhile. But who leads the flock when they fly south? - A male bird. And you're saying that males have a secondary role. - Tõnu! Don't make your trousers dirty. Tõnu! - What? Look, females can't be trusted with any leadership. - Why not? At 17, Joan of Arc rode into Orleans, leading the armies. But to lead an army in the Middle Age meant being half a step ahead of them. Did she wear a chastity belt? - No need, she was holy for the soldiers. Are you capable of understanding, that one person may be holy for another? An Estonian city, Tartu, on the banks of Emajõgi river... Wake up. You'll miss Tartu. I miss everything in life, apart from my husband coming home. What time did he come last night? - Half past two. But sits at the wheel like an iron bolt. - He is iron. Unfortunately, I'm not. Edvin's going mad with worry. We said we'll come by one, and it's gone two. Damned Helena, bought herself thermal underwear. Roy! Mid-life delights. - What? Tõnu calls thermal underwear 'mid-life delights'. Oh, what a spinster! Three eels, three steaks... - I only want soup. Tõnu and me are buying. - I said, I only want soup. Tõnu, I want champagne. So you're a student? A biologist? - Yes. Very interesting. In which year? - Third. Student years are the most beautiful time of life. - Yes, not bad. Where did you study? - I have an odd education: music school and one year of conservatoire. But for women, education is not of highest importance, eh? - Depends on the woman. I guess you travel a lot? - Yes, especially in the summer. Have you been to Nigul? - No, and won't got either. Hello, boy. - Hubert, for you. Hello, boy. - Uncle Raud! - Do you have a moment? Can I steal Hubert for a moment? - Yes, go ahead. - Let's go to the bar. Who is that? - How should I know everyone. I'd like to have the photos you took. When in Tallinn, stop by. Thanks. I don't have a business card to give you. - It's all ahead of you, business cards and other joys. - Perhaps... Turn here, please. Please stop here. Vika! Be a good boy and see what my watch says. Almost half two. - I'm getting old, can't see so well in the dark. Remember: I haven't said a thing, but be prepared for them to offer the position to you. Many in the Federation opposed your candidacy, you understand, why, but the old an and me, we said that we believe in you. We believe you could take the women to higher league in one year. Make sure you don't let us down. Oh no, I haven't had a drop for a year and a half. - That's good. Then go for it, do some work. Come on, get out. Let's go. He's gone out. A long time ago? - About an hour ago. Does this dog bite? - Depends. And don't forget, it's the top team. You know what that means. You must work really hard. The game's moved on, loads are higher. See what my watch says now. - Ten to three. Then I must go. Please walk with me. Joan of Arc Soviet Woman Joan of Arc Problème et mystère de Jeanne d’Arc is out, Levandovski is here. Since when are you interested in mystics? Since I've been interested in Joan of Arc. What happened to Joan of Arc and what she was, is a miracle. I couldn't call it anything else. - You want to write about her? Don't know yet. I first want to understand what went on there. That's why I'm even going to a clairvoyant who is also supposed to... Oh my God... Thank you. You want some coffee? - Yes. - Come and sit down. Are you going to pop by the upstairs? - No time, someone is waiting for me. Do you take sugar? Sugar is over there. You haven't married, have you? - Oh no. It's quite enough for me to watch my friends' marriages. - Yeah... You know, I don't understand what has happened to men. The clever ones are weak. The strong ones are stupid. Yes... 14.29. Tõnu... Dear god, he's started drinking again. Tõnu, do something. Do something. He plays quite well. Stop fussing, go and sit in the car. Have you paid? Bernhard! Watch out, kid. What are they going to do with him? Nothing, I would have thought, he wasn't drunk, just playing the piano. Was he drinking juice at the bar then? - Stop whining, Silva'll take care of it. What would that poor man do without Silva. Here they come! Hello, Kilburn! I'm starting to get fed up with this malarkey. If we got to Nigul, all would become clear. All is clear to me anyway. We've just been together too little. I wonder whose fault that is. Don't know. Such is life. That's how it is, silly is your little heart. Doesn't let you la-lal-lal-laa, but it's still your very own heart... I need to get in the water, I'm soaked through with this dog and the drunk tank. Hold on, where are you going? Pille, come in the water! It's warm. We're not going to get anywhere this way. - Never mind. Come on, don't be afraid. - Hold on. Come on, come on. Helena, you come as well. - I don't have a swimsuit. You bought swimming trunks at Põltsamaa, didn't you? Tõnu, don't swim far. Tõnu, wait! - Pille, come on! What are you gaping at? Can't you see I'm naked? Stop that! That's enough! Hold on a bit more. You know what we're going to do on Monday when we go to town? We'll go to the old airfield, and I'll teach you to drive. In autumn, you'll take the exam and get a licence. It'll be good for your and merrier for me. We'd come from a birthday or restaurant... Oh, like you take me to a restaurant. Last time was maybe three years ago. What about today? - Hubert took us today. Hubert, it's summer. It's all alright. - What's alright? It's warm, birds are singing. It makes you feel glad. What good is the summer, if there's no point. I could argue with that. What has no point? My life. There isn't really anyone to live for. I was offered the position of the coach of the women's volleyball team. First I was glad, but now I'm thinking, what difference does it make, whether I train a team or a schoolboy. I will still remain the same. - You think the clairvoyant will help? Ah, I don't know. The why are you going to him? - I don't know, Silva wanted to. Then my health'll be all catered for: got inhalators, seen the quack doctor. You believe the inhalator helps? - No, that's why I'm going. See, you don't believe in inhalators, for they're too simple and real, but then your mind also rejects miracles. We're like pilgrims, but we don't know what we believe. - Tõnu knows. That's why he is so healthy. - I think Tõnu is disabled. He thinks money can buy everything, but can't see it won't buy peace of soul. I'm not sure he is that greedy. But he sure knows how to live. Let's teach Evelin as well. Imagine how nice: us two oldies in the back, and our daughter driving. Come here. Tõnu? Where are you? Tõnu! Tõnu! Tõnu! Tõnu, where are you? Tõnu! So. Turn right, get hanged. Turn left, get drowned; go straight, get a kingdom. I don't need a kingdom, if I could just get the car debt paid... Hello, madam. - Hello, grandma. Hello. - How do we get to Nigul's place? To the old schoolhouse? To Nigul's place? - Yes. Go straight on, up to the bridge, then turn right. Then go straight on until you see a big tree, and then turn left. Then go straight on until... - Have a good day, grandma. Oh, it is good! What happened? How do I know, I haven't had a look yet. Right, so here we are. What is it? - You can see for yourself, oil everywhere. Maybe we ran out petrol? Ladies, this is a toilet stop. Quick, into the bushes, all of you. Tõnu, please tuck your shirt in. - You too, on you go, into the bushes. God, how you can... - You, make yourself useful, get the spanners. I can tell you the same thing a hundred times... Crappiest crap, I say. - Here you are. - Give it to me. And now do what I say. - Okay. - Be quiet. The road is also like a great bio-rhythm, up the hill, then down the hill. It's all pluses for Tõnu and me on 6 September. What does that mean? Don't know, the computer just shows, but does not predict. Ask Nigul. - I won't even dare open my mouth in his presence. Wonder what he's like? - Supposed to be an ordinary man. No, our men are ordinary, there must be something special in him. Yes, hands or eyes must be special, otherwise I won't be able to believe him. I wonder how old he is? - Oh dear, maybe he's a young man? This is making me shiver. Maybe he can also read your mind? Let him read, maybe learns some wisdom. Hey, is it something serious? - Yeah, crap roads. Now we're stuck. What do you come here for then? - Tell us which way to go. To where? - To Nigul's place. - I don't know no Niguls. Look, you got a crack in here. - What crack? Carburetor's blocked. But perhaps it's the vent belt? - Oh, it's not that bad. Do we have to stay here for the night? Hello. - Hello. Meeta, come and greet the guests! I'll finish here, then I'll make your bed. - Oh, thank you, I'll do it myself. Stop faffing around, you old git. Go take the pillows and blankets, people want to go to bed. My husband used to be very nervous, always tended to drink. No idea what Nigul did or said to him, but now everything is alright. What kind of a person is this Nigul? - A nice person, a good person. He says diseases come from wrong thoughts. But where do the wrong thoughts come from? Do you have a serious ailment? I have told you, no sitting and listening at the table. Chop-chop, off to bed! ...and if you keep them, always keep two, for no human or animal wants to be alone. Then they're a lot easier to keep. Your take them to the field, put on chain and they'll stay there till noon. Heavens, how good it is that we came here. I had a chance to talk to everyone, even my husband. - Good for you. My husband sometimes doesn't talk to me for days. Yes, Hubert has changed a lot. He used to be chatty, merry. I guess sports has left its mark. - What sports? Spent his best years on booze. - At least that's alright now. What's alright? Back then he got drunk, but acted like a man. I'm like a grandma. Pampering him, driving the car, finding medicine. You, and a grandma? You've got a figure to kill for. Wouldn't ever say you're 35... Oh dear, I've caught the sun. Do you have any cream? - Is your skin greasy or dry? Sometimes dry, sometimes greasy. Take this one then. Yes? Excuse me. It's not much here, but it'll make do for one night. We've had people from Tallinn before. - We'll be alright. Excuse me, I wanted to ask, did you not perform here in our village a few years ago, singing? Yes, I did, but a long time ago. In that case I was right, and I was still a bachelor back then. Could I get your autogram? - Yes, of course. Dear god, you haven't changed a bit. Silva Lippus singing Here you go. Sleep tight. - Good night. - Good night! Come and light my cigarette, my hands are dirty. Where are they? - Left pocket. Here, take it. You want me to clean you nose too? - I don't need to be pampered like some. Like who? - Like some wusses. You're a true hick. - Oh yeah? Then your sister is a wife of a hick. Is that so? - Unfortunately yes. I could say a thing or two about your wife as well. Like what? - Like this! What 'this'? - This 'this'. You gone nuts? - Bloody hell, I'll fucking kill you! Don't be silly, put the scythe down. Stop being silly. Put down the scythe. Guys, stop being silly! Stop screaming. What is it? Come on, let's go. Let's put him here. The other leg, damn it! Lady. Who's there? Come on in, don't hang in the doorway. Lady, do you know any fairytales? - I do, but shouldn't you be in bed? Come here then, but quickly. Sit here, properly. Put your legs... - Right, are you settled? So, here we go... - This is Tallinn, the time is 23:00. Once upon a time France had been locked up and the key had been thrown in a well in Orleans. And the well was guarded by a great dragon. The dragon had many eyes and ears, it heard and saw everything. Everyone was afraid of it, but in one of the villages there lived a girl called Joan and that girl had friends. Those friends came to her in the woods like fairies. They were invisible. No one heard or saw what they told Joan. Even the dragon didn't hear. And one day the friends told her that she has to go and fight the dragon, to take the key out of the well and unlock France. Why do you think it had to be Joan? It was because Joan was the purest girl in France... Kids, go to bed right now! Come here. - Every night we have to go. I wanted to hear the fairytale. - Go to sleep, I'll tell you tomorrow. Come on, go. Good night to you. Lady, what happened then? - If they're not dead, they're still living happily. I see. Good night. - Good night. According to the media the leaders of the gang, who until now had only been known as Katarina and Margaretha, confessed that they had aimed to topple the ruling order and turn back towards nature. Be a good girl. - Thank you for putting us up. Things are not that simple with Nigul. - Why? What can be that complicated about it? It's not like you go limping to Nigul and come back dancing. You should rather see a doctor in town. - I want to go and see Nigul! We all need to see Nigul. - Well, I guess it's up to you. Goodbye and thank you the lodging. - Don't mention it. Come again. What the hell is over there? An accident? You're already on the list. To see Nigul? - Yes. What's this? - Queueing number. You're now in the queue.
