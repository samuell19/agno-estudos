'Apple of my eye; my dearest' Why is uncle going overboard with his sacred antics? I don't know who he'll target this year to tarnish their life Why is your house locked? What are you doing here? Where is your interest due? - I'll pay you soon, sir - What's with you? What is this disguise? Lord Karna, sir You are unable to pay the interest for your loan And you'll dress up as the generous king Karna, huh? "In the paddy fields lush and green Indian beech trees with flowers seen" "In the highways bustling with activity tamarind trees blossom in plenty" "In directions 8, everywhere our neem trees rustle with fanfare" "Knowing you'll be coming, at that moment the flowers open their eyes in excitement" "One who graced Vaigai river as our savior Our Chozhavandhan Mariamma we favor" "Shall I receive You with love?" "Our Goddess who came from above" "Shall I welcome You with happiness One who wears a garland of durva grass?" "Shall I invite You with gratitude forever One who cures chicken pox in the summer?" "Come, o' Goddess of rain" "The leafy canopied ghaf tree was cut down with utmost sanctity" "To carry my favorite deity carved as a casket sturdy" "Inside that wooden casket my kohl lined deity basked" "Epitome of fury Avatar of Kali" Do you know how our Mariamma was enclosed in that casket? "One with turmeric paste applied With dhavanam's perfume alongside" "Shall I call my deity to bless us The copper statue so wondrous?" "Come, Goddess Shakthi" At a time when there was no famine when pangs of hunger attacked us When all these people assembled and wondered what to do Lord Krsna commanded Varuna the God of rain and said Shower rain in abundance Heavy rains lashed flooding the land it seems The casket with our Goddess carried by the ripples of the Palar river In the waters sweet as honey floats the casket of our Mariamma Your casket slides to the banks green with the waters gently lapping in between When everyone wondered what this casket contained Our deity Mariamma dear to bring us prosperity here "Goddess in a casket, shall I welcome You? The renowned one, who comes to our rescue" "Shall I welcome You, avatar of Shakti? One with name and fame in totality" "Goddess Cholavandhan Mariamma" "Our Chozhavandhan Mariamma, our savior Our Goddess whom we fear and favor" "Shall I welcome our Sornamuthu Mariamma?"

Why haven't so many farmers paid back their loans? Who will take up the responsibility of this loss? Madam, the problem here is- Villagers are not soft like the city bred They may be a bit violent I am mentioning this because many of our officers had bad experiences Where there is honesty both anger and violence co exist It's alright We'll face that too So bring all the pending files to my notice - Okay - Okay, madam Thank you! It's rare nowadays for girls to work in villages Why are you scaring them? Will they dole out loans with open arms in your city? Don't be unrealistic Appa, look who is here You are dead meat today He'll close your chapter Uncle, stop it Stop it, all of you How can you do such injustice? What did I do? How often should I repeat it? Even Americans use a neem stick as tooth brush The world is going green If I say all this do I look like a fool to you, huh? You are a genius But leave us alone Natural fertiliser won't be conducive to this soil This land has got used to this manure I can't repay my loan if I don't harvest 3-4 times a year Change your habit Yov! This is our Mother earth Even if you stamp, doesn't she support you and me? For that at least shouldn't we protect her? All our documents are collaterals in a pawnshop! Wonder who jinxed me this morning Why are you bugging me while I am working? Couldn't you find anyone else today? Why are you perturbed? I'll gladly give you earthworm fertilizer for free Just say yes, I'll bring it from my house and pile it here Please don't use those chemicals Don't betray the soil that trusts you You don't understand my plight I've bought all this fertiliser on loan Aiyo! Uncle, I don't intend leaving till you change your mind Kanna, what are you doing here? We've been looking for you all over Look at what uncle is doing Didn't he promise to use only organic manure that day? Look what he is up to now Sir, I didn't think when I promised that day Please forgive me Uncle, we can't keep forgiving you For the next harvest change to natural fertiliser - Say 'yes' - I swear I'll change I'll buy organic manure from you Leave me alone now, sir You heard him Let's go, Kanna Let's attend to our work Muthu, how are you? Hey Kanna Nowhere to be seen I saw you in the temple that day You left before I could talk to you That's a big story By the way where is your husband? - Where will he go? - Come, Kanna - Would you like some tea? - I just drank, Chandra - Buttermilk - No, it's alright Hey Kanna, you are a smart young boy Why are you still roaming around single? Karuppu, you tag along always Can't you find a girl for him? You expect them to? If they are with me, even a girl who flips for me will flee - Hey Chandra - What, Kanna? Count the coconuts and unload them I'll buy whatever price you quote When have I bargained with you? Whatever Muthu says is fine with me If the buyer fixes the price their sales is really one of a kind! He is my childhood friend Now you know what trust means? Kanna, let me look for a bride Don't worry if I don't find one I'll divorce my husband and gladly marry you Kindly do me this favor Take her with you If you succeed I'm freed of a life sentence Don't think you can escape from me, dear That will never happen Am I the pawn in your game? Hey Karuppu, are they serious or is it their weird sense of humor? They were classmates Don't be suspicious Okay, let's go Muthu, see you - Send me the money - Prompt as usual Muthaiyah has taken 8 loans He has repaid 4 Kazhuvaayi has taken 5 loans And repaid 2 Kamala Kannan has taken 9 loans for his cattle Not repaid even 1 There isn't even a gap of 2 months between each loan Who approved his loans? There are many adjustments in this locality If you delve too deep into it ...VAO, collector, tahsildar the whole system will oppose us Forget how it was given and focus on retrieving the money Sir, we can't use local thugs like private banks do Madam, most of them who availed loans here are proper thugs Let it be I won't step back from taking the required legal action I need to meet each and every one of them - And we will start with Kamala Kannan - Okay, madam Did you drive the tractor or roll it in mud? Full of muck and mire Who listens to you here? Our vehicle is their training tool! Kamala Kannan sir, I'm Vetri Kumaran - From Madurai Grama Bank - I know you We would like to discuss about your cattle loans We are paying the dues Even sir knows it Who paid? Records don't show a single payment She is our new manager Her name is Bharathi Good afternoon, madam Namaste, Mr Kamala Kannan You look educated But why are you doing this? You own a lot of property Should you avail Govt loans and cheat them? Can't you lead a straightforward life? I can understand if you really can't repay By greasing their palms... ...isn't there a limit to indulging in fraudulent deals? If I have done anything wrong I'll face it legally See, let me keep it very simple If you don't repay your loan I'll take action So be careful Kanna, you must slap her at least once 'What temerity!' She dares to come here and threaten us 'She should be taught a lesson' Many of them who take loans have no intention of repaying They wait for a new Govt to dissolve their loans I'm not targeting the poor who can't repay I just can't bear to see the affluent ones who trick the Govt through loans Fraudsters! That isn't true Miss Bharathi If we handle those with clout in a diplomatic manner ...it augurs well for us Will big shots have 2 horns or what? Will they pierce us? I'm not scared of all this It is my duty This is just a simple cattle loan of a villager What will you gain by intervening and investigating? How can you take a cattle loan so lightly? Do you know the worst corruption in India is cattle fodder? In our country cows are the biggest problem People's taxes are used as loans We stretch our hands for our salary Shouldn't we do justice to it? When those who cheat are brave why should we be scared cowards? Hey, wait right here I'll be back Bro, what about your security? Dai! 1st take care of the car Don't come inside Stay in the car Our bro doesn't look the least bit angry He'll bottle it up inside Thanks - Mathrabootham sir - Tell me, madam Ask why Kamala Kannan of Vadipatti is waiting out? Kamala Kannan sir Come here 1 minute What are you waiting for? Madam wants to know the reason I want to thank madam Madam, he wants to thank you Thank me? Why? I didn't ask Shall I ask him? It's okay, ask him to come She asked you to go in - Tell me - Madam I repaid 2 loans as per your suggestion - When will you pay the balance? - Give me some time I'll repay one by one Do it fast What you've done is forgery Repay before I take any action Why do you need to thank me? You said 'Can't you lead an honest life?' I liked that a lot I have work to do Thank you so much We need signatures from 2 witnesses for our Home's registration You are here The other witness is on the way Good morning Namaste Congratulations Madam, please sign I really feel very proud This Old Age Home is being registered as Mother Teresa's Home I thank Miss Bharathi of Madurai Grama Bank And my dear friend Kamala Kannan advocator of organic farming I ask our friend Kamala Kannan to say a few words now Good morning to everyone Brother Chozha Nagarajan referred to this as Old Age Home This isn't an Old Age Home But Care for the Elderly Old age is an unavoidable phase to every human being on earth For those who have reached that stage before us I firmly believe this care center will provide all the required comfort Thank you See you, bro What is this place? If parents had a son like you this is the haven they must seek! Zip your lips and open the door Should I explain even an Old Age Home to you? 'Our guest in today's farmers' program is Kamala Kannan from Vadipatti' 'Greetings' 'How did you get interested in organic farming?' 'When I was studying in Agricultural college' '...I grew up reading books by Nammalvar agricultural scientist and green crusader' 'Johan Fredrik of Germany and our own Gandhiji' 'I was enlightened, I felt only we can save our own land' 'Why shouldn't I give this my full fledged support?' 'So this became my dream' 'Farming alone won't do We need organic manure' 'We are producing earthworm fertilizer' 'Our earthworms will save our soil that was ruined by chemicals' 'People are leaning towards natural organic farming methods' 'What do you think?' 'I'm very happy people prefer the 'Go Green' movement' 'This boosts up my faith in my dream even more' 'I am sure a change is just round the corner' Bill it please - Yes, madam - Vetri sir Kamala Kannan has graduated in Agricultural science in Madurai He belongs to an agricultural lineage He's a landlord too Why should he avail 9 cattle loans? I feel something is fishy If you are in doubt we can enquire, madam - You go and find out - Okay, madam Who the hell is this? Why are you honking in front of a locked gate? - We were sleeping - What do you want? Madam wants to inspect all the cows for your cattle loans Big shots can't show up Take the nonentities Both of you go Bro, don't come to the road and get caught, that's all I can say Go now, don't I know you're Kasi's son? - Are you a pilot? - I'll tweak your ear He's a Govt employee That's how he'll talk - Let's attend to our work - Our work is to go back to sleep! Watch your step This cow Here, huh? Take care Namaste We are from the bank Is this your cow? Yes, sir My son is a drunkard His liquor ate up all our lands We can't pay our house rent I have pledged all my possessions I was struggling without even 1 square meal a day Kamala Kannan lad came to my rescue and availed a cattle loan for me Due to the circumstances and our situation I couldn't repay Don't blame Kamala Kannan Please ensure you won't hassle him He's like a son to me Thanks to him we are able to survive May God bless him I'll show you the next candidate Let's go My parents were well diggers My father died while digging a well He fell prey to a mudslide My mother and I were somehow making ends meet I was working in a telephone booth Not a well paid job Kamala Kannan said 'Don't worry, Mary I'll help out' He got us a cattle loan and that's how we are making ends meet We'll pay up very soon Don't ask him to pay this Please wait, madam I'll pay definitely - I'll take leave - Okay, madam I told you I'll repay all my loans Why did you go to their houses and threaten those poor souls? Kannan sir, madam wanted a clear picture about your loans That's why we went It's our duty, sir - Yes, madam - Ask him to come in You can go in and talk to madam Sir, you feel like donating Do it with your own money Why do charity with bank's money? This isn't charity It's a job opportunity for them If you give them cash they will spend it They will be focused in their work if they have to repay the bank That's why I got them a cattle loan Haven't you heard of the fish and bait story? Give the bait and not the fish That's what I did Please don't go and talk to my people hereafter I take full responsibility Repay your loan We won't disturb you 'A few days later...' Grandma, a girl has come to see you - Who are you? - I want to meet Kamala Kannan bro Why, dear? I've passed 12th grade I've got a seat in a medical college I must get his signature regarding my education loan Can I meet him? Who told you he signs for all this? Bharathi madam in Madurai Grama Bank told me - Is anna here? - Who is she? A new Bharathi 'madam'? She's the fair swan in Madurai bank Our enemy Ignore her - What is your name? - Venmani, bro How much did you score? -1189 - Very good What do your parents do?

NEET exam is very tough How did you prepare for it? Aiyo! That's a big torture, bro Even 3-4 students who excel failed in this exam, bro My father sold his land and sent me for tuition class I worked heart and soul and I passed the exam How can we study Central board questions not taught in our state board syllabus? How do we answer such questions? Aren't students who passed out before us regarded as doctors, bro? My dear girl don't get me wrong Your awareness of politics is super If you studied law instead of medicine ...you have a bright future No, bro This is my ambition What did you study, bro? Just like you, I went in for a professional course Our country doesn't offer a job nor show respect for my subject I took a degree in agriculture in Madurai Agricultural college So you've passed 2 exams simultaneously You must be exhausted What to do, bro 1st they grabbed money from us by way of college admissions Now tuition class became a big scam True that With such a vast syllabus and varied subjects... ...to force students to attempt all this at the same time is just not fair at all Those who need to know should get enlightened! Hey! What's NEET? Waking me up and asking me irrelevant questions All that is academic related Just go back to sleep So even you don't know? They didn't teach us all that in 8th grade It has been added only now I'm quite surprised by Kamala Kannan Only yesterday I saw his Facebook profile He doesn't have a single girl in his Friends list He cleared all the bank loans day before yesterday, ma'am Sounds good Come along Hello, Kannan sir Madam told me Give me your file Vetri sir, what is the % you charge for educational loans? 10-12% Sir, what do you mean?

People above 60 don't qualify Only pension is available Ask them to collect that cash Why can't a person above 60 qualify for a job? Our prime minister, president, chief minister are all 60+, right? Don't they hold an office? You're such a nuisance, I swear! "As I walk on the road thinking of you Unaware, I pass my house like a fool" "Seven + seven as 10, I add My math has never been so bad" "I can't discern east from west now I've lost my sense of direction somehow" "In whichever direction you maybe seems like the auspicious east to me" "You are the water in my roots complete You are the honey in my flowers sweet" "What else will you do to me, I entreat?"

Stop, man - Ezhumalai - Uncle, open the door - Unlock the door - Ezhumalai I won't harm you Unbolt the door 'Open the door' 'Unlatch the door' Let go of this Ezhumalai, why did you take such a rash decision? Do you have any sense? If you die, that news won't even be reported! Who will take care of your daughter? We borrow money for farming The fertilizer seller takes half the amount Moneylender grabs the remaining amount, sir Look at this bulb hanging here The manufacturer decides on its price But the crops we produce with our blood, sweat and tears ...we are unable to fix a price Even the consumer doesn't get it Even we farmers don't benefit It lines the pockets of the middle men alone As a protest in Delhi we ran without a stitch on us, we even ate rat curry Did anyone in this country ask why? Everyone just watched us with amusement or curiosity How can we survive under such conditions? Aiyo! I don't have the money Otherwise I'll definitely pay, sir Sir, we didn't come here asking for money Please pay when you can Thank you very much, madam Uncle, times will change It won't continue the same way If you don't work, people in the cities will starve Trust me You are like God Whatever hardship please don't resort to this - Hello...? - Bharathi, this is Kannan here - Kamala Kannan - Tell me, Kamala Kannan There's an alumni meet in my college tomorrow morning I'm attending it If you are free can you come with me?

I heard about Bharathi That Madurai bank officer Her family and relatives We don't know their customs and habits They won't understand our lifestyle We belong to a family of agriculturists I don't know what to say If no one in our family circle approves then what do we do? Father, just like that how can I say 'no' to her? I didn't tell you to forget that girl Hey, Ramasamy What are you saying? What does he know about deceit or dishonesty? He doesn't even know to differentiate a burnt 'paniyaram' from a good one Discussing all this with such a naive boy Her complexion, the way she talks or her home and surroundings Who knows what he saw and flipped for her My dear grandson You were just 5 years old Your mother handed you over to me and died From then, only we have been taking care of you We know to decide what is good and bad for you Take me to that girl's house Let's see if it will work out Or if we can iron the creases if any Otherwise... ...what I decide is final!

My grandma is enquiring about you downstairs You are questioning me here on the terrace You can come up with the answer too She'll be asking about our caste How did you guess so right?

Kanna, come up You are wanted here I'm coming Drink less and eat fast Kanna, best wishes for your first night What do you mean by 'first' night? Hasn't he seen a night before? Partner, in every marriage a girl gets a husband But a friend loses his friend Understood? Tanked, huh? Grandma, I'm leaving for work I'm off to work Old people look forward to their daughter-in-law ...taking over the household chores The tables are turned here Like Indira Gandhi, prim and proper, with a purposeful stride 'Then who is to do all the household chores?' 'Who will cook?' Who will wash the clothes? Am I her servant maid to do all this? 'At daybreak women usually come to my house to work' 'A woman from my household shouldn't go out to work' Ganesha 'Yes, bro' Is the farm house empty?

I am leaving half my life behind Please take good care of my son As far as I know instead of living in a joint family after being married ...you are the 1st man to go live independently Usually sons argue with their father Then raise their fists But like a rooster under a spell, you agree to whatever your father says That's how I am Naresh, why are you doing all this? Take it from him You come in - Sorry - Please go, Your Highness - Saw that? - No, I didn't You should have been his brother-in-law, go in Hey Karuppu Let me carry an item No one is scared of me being their manager!

Nothing It's okay Speak your mind out Shall we bathe together? "Chrysanthemum of mine Island of orange skies sublime" "You came before me like golden honey" "You ignited my dormant masculinity" "My husband, my true-blue Brave heart from Tamil Nadu" "You came like a vision in front of me" "You fuelled my femininity" Bharathi Bharathi It's early morning The sun has risen Why has this 'moon' not yet gone? - Not going to work today - Why?

Whatever I do will always be right, dear Your grandma and others haven't understood you well enough Your education and job come across as temerity to them At this juncture if we are a joint family... ...their hints and digs at you Their ignorance will only hurt you The 1st year of marriage... ...should be happy memories to recollect later on I didn't want you to lose that pleasure That's why I decided Uncle, I never understood your thoughtfulness or farsightedness Please bless me with a happy, healthy life It's okay, dear May you be happy You'll always do well in life - Wait, I'll be back - Okay, sir Tell me, Arumugam Do you know this news or not?

Bring a plate of rice Let's taste it 'Days passed by' What is bothering you, Kannan? You are here out of the blue?

Okay! Kanna, pick up the phone! When will you pick up the phone? Isn't that Kannan? Why is he talking to this fellow? Must be some lending and borrowing between them, come inside You came home to borrow money Don't you know to return? If you intended to return you would've come home I never said it isn't your money, no? Will you even say that? What is this, bro? Hitting me while I'm talking to you I thought you're educated and you're trying to cheat royally? Muthu, did you see that?

Scrawny fellow Hey, Alagar Come fast to our common grounds Hey, Nagendra Come out With whose permission did you lend money? Before lending, did you ask the elders in the family? I have enough assets to last for the next 4 or 5 generations Why should we borrow money from you? Nagendra, why did you lose your temper? You hit my grandson who is always as righteous as Lord Rama ...who doesn't hurt anyone He doesn't even stamp a worm You thought no one will defend him? She's from a respectable family If she curses us, we won't prosper Dai, are you coming out or should I come in? Nagendra, come out, da How dare you hit my- It was wrong on my part to hit him Forgive me I should have asked you before lending the money Send the money Give him the money How could you? Did you just watch till he borrowed 300000? Why is he so short of money? If he had asked his father he would've given, so would you Why does he need so much money? - She would've told him not to ask - Who...? New addition into our family Walks erect like Indira Gandhi She married him just as she wanted, right? Arrogance!
