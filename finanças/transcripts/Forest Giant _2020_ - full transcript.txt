THE FINNISH FILM FOUNDATION FUNDS FINNISH FILMS BASED ON A NOVEL BY MIIKA NOUSIAINEN Hello, boy. - It's a girl. Yes, it's a girl. You can see it here. - Oh. Here are the arms and legs. Hi, Katariina. When can you come to the office? -In an hour. 45 minutes. Do you want to advance in your career?- Yes. So? - I'll see you in 30 minutes. You can see the fingers clearly. All five of them. She looks like she's boxing. The umbilical cord. Katariina wants to see me at the office. - Now? Now. Aren't we done here? The apartment showing is at 5. - Yeah, yeah, I'll be there. I know you want a house, - but I've got a good feeling about this apartment. Apartment buildings are so depressing. - This one isn't. Aren't you going to drop me off so I can buy the stroller? C'mon. - You'll do fine, honey. Be on time. I've talked about stepping-stones. This is one for you. Okay. I'm sending you to Törmälä. Is that a problem? No. Not at all. - Good. The plywood mill needs optimizing. At the moment, it generates 9 percent of our revenue. Increase it a couple of notches, - and you may be sitting here some day. I'll take this desk with me, though. You can buy yourself a new one. - Sure. A couple of dismissals, early retirements, - no rebel activity, no headlines. You know what? - What? Seems pretty straightforward to me. - Good. They trust you because you grew up there. Fucking Törmälä. DIRECTED BY VILLE JANKERI FOREST GIANT The rural town of Törmälä, in Central Finland, - was founded in the early 1900s. Tycoon Sven Ljungkvist stumbled upon the area while on a hunting trip. He fell asleep outside, drunk, and dreamed of a sawmill by the river. He built the sawmill, - and the village of Törmälä grew beside it. The mill increased its capacity. It produced plywood, which was used for floors, signs and furniture. In the 1960s, the era of the tycoon came to an end, - and the Törmälä Plywood Mill - merged with Metsäjätti. Over the following decades, the mill expanded and hired more workers. One of them was forest harvest operator Jarmo Raninen. His porn collection is rumored to be - the largest south of Lapland. He used to tell masturbation stories to local kids. Today it would be a crime, but back in the 90s, - it was an essential part of the town's character. Jarmo Raninen has worked his whole life in the plywood industry. The plywood industry uses the best part of the tree, the log. The paper and pulp industries use whatever is left. Yet, people working in the paper and pulp industries make more money. Thus, their houses and cars are nicer. Paper mill workers can buy new cars. Plywood mill workers buy used ones. This injustice pisses off the Törmälä mill workers on a daily basis. The population of Törmälä is 5,253. The official flower of Törmälä is the tufted vetch. Törmälä's twin town is Polish industrial town Świętochłowice. All in all, Törmälä is a normal Finnish town. It's nice in the summer. Maybe not during the 90s' recession, but in the 80s during the upswing, - people had a good time in the old lumber port on sunny days. At least in the early evening. Friends, we have more than one reason to celebrate. Last month was the best in the mill's history. The capacity has been close to 80,000 cubic meters for quite a while. You're doing a good job. I can't praise you enough. Good job, Jari! - Yeah, yeah. But we have to remember - that we have to do as well or better in the future. This might sound alarming, but we don't need to worry. Headquarters is sending the head of development here - to review our process. What the fuck? Let's remember we just broke our record. They'll lay people off again. - They can't be that stupid. They want to use us as a model. That's what they want. They're sending a good man. I'm sure many of you know him. Pasi Kauppi. A local boy. Did he say "Pasi"? - Gutter Pasi. Yeah, him. - Piss Pasi. All right. - Hi. Hello. Welcome. Sorry. - Up we go. Oh my. 125 beautiful square meters. This is unique. You won't find another one like this anytime soon. The lights don't work. - They haven't been installed yet. Right. What if there's a blackout and the elevators stop working? They won't. There's a backup generator in the building. Pasi. Take your time. Please don't hesitate to ask questions. They're building a similar high-rise next to this one, - but it won't ruin the view. How'd the meeting go? - Well. It went well. The promotion is mine. So we'll take this? - We will? Should I call my dad? - No, you should not. So we're taking it? - Yes. We're taking it. - We're taking it. We don't want to look too eager. Let's be cool. - Yeah. Let's be cool. - Okay. Well? Looks like you're interested. Maybe. - Somewhat. This does indeed feel spacious. I want to go with you. - No, you don't. I've never been to Törmälä. - There's nothing to see. I want to see all the places you told me about. I'll just be working there. In and out. I'll be back before you know it. It would've been nice to meet your dad. Yeah. You must miss him. Do you ever think about him? I'll miss you when I'm with the whiny Törmälä folks. Shall we have dessert? I will anyway. - Why not. Pasi Kauppi. - Jari Virtasalmi, mill manager. Kuisma, chief union steward. In the spring, we replaced the feeder on the conveyor. We also added laser micrometers on both lathes. And last month we broke our production record. You've also worked here, right? - Yeah, I've worked here summers. I'm sure it was quite a sight - when half the lake was full of logs. You should prepare yourselves for some layoffs. - What the fuck? You can't do this again. I trust you not to talk to the staff yet. We'll know more in the next few weeks. What's next? Let's go see the soaking basin and the debarker. Fucking shit. BAT techniques. Best available techniques. Moving on. Pasi! Pasi, dammit. What? - Well... This. How long are you staying? When can I see you? I mean, I'm seeing you now, but for real? I'll be around. Let's call. - I have your number. Or do you have a new number? See you. Let's move on. In Harrisburg you have to close the windows in a hurry In Finland you don't need to worry Harrisburg is on another planet Things like that just don't happen here Pasi. Everything's gonna be fine. Welcome to Törmälä. Jorma Lahtinen. - Mauno. Mauno Kauppi. Hi. Sirkka-Liisa. All right. We know how to do this. We can watch the Olympics together. Hey! Shit! - What the hell? Janne, goddammit! What happened? Are you hurt? You'll be okay. Apologize. - I'm sorry, even though it was an accident. All right. Pasi, calm down. Looks like she'll be the world champion. Laying down some twigs... -Goddammit! Marjo! Marjo! Marjo! Pasi! I didn't drink all of them. Or at least I won't admit to it. Er... I have work in the morning. So do I. So, Metallica or Maiden? What? I don't care as long as it's one of the two. Heavy metal is the best. It's a bit like the mechanical forest industry. You do the basic things properly and cut corners a bit, - and the outcome'll be... solid. What's going to happen at the mill? I can't really talk about it. And I don't know exactly yet. Headquarters wants to optimize, even though we're breaking records. What we need here is a railroad. There's already the foundation for a branch line. We used to play there as kids. I'm sure you've discussed these things at headquarters. Thanks. Pay for your own drinks. Thanks. Wow. To Vesa's memory. - To Vesa. Shit Antti. - Yep, Antti. He shoved my head in the toilet all the time. - Me too. Fortunately precocious puberty or bench-pressing 100 kilos - doesn't guarantee success. - In junior high it did. I work with him on the same line. - Janne. How come you never got out? You have potential. For what? What's wrong with this? Hi, Janne. Pasi. Jonne. Sit down. How long are you here for? - A while. How are you? - All right. You're here to fire people. Stop, Antti. - Yeah. He's Pasi. That's right, Antti. Fuck you. I can always ask, can't I? Lake Päijänne is so grand Lakes Keurusselkä and Kuuhankavesi with their waters so clear The noble beauty of the majestic land Oh, I make my home sweet home there I know how we can make Törmälä more profitable.- Tell me more. We don't need layoffs. We'll hire more people. Stick to the plan. - Listen. This is by far the best way to increase profitability. We can't expand. - We can, with a railroad. Too expensive. - The municipality can pay for it. Okay. I remembered there's a foundation for a branch line. It's not in our maps. 3-5 kilometers, depending on how we route it. We'd take property by eminent domain? Törmälä people understand the forest industry. You're sure of the numbers? - I just sent them to you. Check them. Well, it sounds hopeful that they're considering investing in Törmälä. Can I trust you to support the project? I already talked to the mayor. She seemed sympathetic. Yeah, she's not from here. That's why she doesn't have a negative attitude to change. We naturally want the railroad. The mayor isn't the problem. Then who is? Järvinen, the Left Alliance. - Pasi Kauppi. Mauno's your dad. - That's right. I worked with your dad. At first it went well. A railroad. - I see it as a good thing for Törmälä. Investing in the railroad would guarantee dozens of jobs. - At least. So the municipality would buy the railroad for the plywood mill. The municipality wouldn't only help with the costs; it would show investors - your ecosystem is favorable for the company. - Ecosystem? You've let us down so many times over the years. You're asking us to invest a hell of a lot of money in a railroad, - but it doesn't guarantee us anything. You plan ahead five years, maximum. I don't think we need to discuss this any further. Pirkko, let's go. Get ready. Go. One, two, three, four. Hi, Pasi. - Hi. The boys are in Vesa's room. Hi. Look, exactly like Krista. It's not worthwhile. - What? Nothing's worthwhile. No matter which road you choose, - the expected gain is never better than making no choice at all. - Huh? This here is Sigma. It represents your hopes and dreams - of Krista being interested in you. This here is X, the unpleasant reality - where she's not interested. It's hopeless with girls - because you have to take so many things into consideration. Competition with other boys, appearance, the quality of jokes, - courage and things like that. Oh shit. -What's this? Oh, that. That was almost worthwhile. But in the end, nothing's worthwhile. You're being so gloomy again. Boys, have a soda. What are you doing sitting here in the dark? Come swim with me. Vesa, you too. They have three stories, an Amiga 500 and an indoor swimming pool. Can you imagine, an indoor pool? -Pasi. I don't want you hanging out with that rich kid. Why? - It's not worthwhile. You and Vesa agree on that one. There you go. You see, there are people who live in a house - and us who live in an apartment. That's the way it is. Get ready. Three. Two. One. Go! Piss! Piss! What the hell are you doing? - We're playing! Playing what? - Gutter hockey. Piss! Piss! What the hell? - The boys are playing gutter hockey. Ten marks to Pasi and Janne. Ten marks to Pasi. How can anybody be so damn stupid? This is Törmälä. Nothing's worthwhile here. We'll continue with the original plan? - No. We're not giving up. The !eft Alliance is the biggest party on the municipal council, - followed by the Social Democrats. The two leftist parties have always been in the lead here. What's the chairperson of the Social Democrats like?- Kuisma? The chief union steward at the mill. He'll support the railroad for sure. Okay. This turned into a lobbying gig. How? - We'll make the railroad the Social Democrats' electoral weapon. When is the municipal election? - !ate October. You know the locals. Find candidates who would support the railroad. This was a bad idea. - No, it wasn't. One vote can be decisive. I don't mean that. I meant your car. - What about it? A fancy car will arouse suspicion. You mean I should've rented some old piece of shit? - I have a car. You're saying we should've taken your old piece of shit? Talk more. Take control of the situation. It's a gift from my late sister. But this one I found at the market in Kuopio. In 1964. Very nice. - Was it expensive? No. But this one, from the 1920s - is worth something. Is it Jesus? - Do you believe in Jesus? Right... I have nothing against him, but I don't. I mean, he hasn't moved into my heart. Yet. Even though I've kept all the windows open. ENSURE THE MILL'S FUTURE! It's hard work making you a politician. I can't lie to old people. - Start learning, for fuck's sake. If you want to vote for big business, vote for the other party! If you want to tell the capitalist minions to fuck off, - vote for the Left Alliance! A vote for us is a vote for the railroad. A vote for them is a vote for unemployment. - That's right! A vote for the railroad - is a vote for an impossible dream! We need the railroad. International competition is tough. We have to keep up. Janne, you've got our vote. Can we start drinking now? Sure. We could increase the degree of product processing if we expand. We could have a new assembly line and produce a new type of plywood. The future of the Finnish forest industry - lies in these products! - Janne for parliament! Together, we can build Törmälä into the plywood capital of Finland! That's right. If you have a drink, raise your glass. What? - Weren't you supposed to go back to Helsinki today? Shit. Can you clean up? All right. Nice to see you again. Sorry I'm late again. - That's okay. Congratulations. Great decision. - Thanks. Enjoy. - Thanks. Hi. - Hi. You've been lobbying hard, huh? - Yes. How are you? - Okay. Good. I love you. - I'm coming with you to Törmälä. You'll get bored there. - I'll get bored here too. You're not coming with me. People in Törmälä aren't like you and me. People in Törmälä? What are we like then? I mean they're different. They listen to heavy metal and eat fish sticks. What's wrong with that? Why are you like that? I think I'm nervous. Because of the election. Honey. It'll be fine. All right. That's my bottle collection. But Janne didn't drink them all. - True. I love Laphroaig. - So do I. I can finish a glass in no time. That's the sign of a good whiskey. Thanks. All right. Welcome to Törmälä. - Thanks. Pasi told me you played on the same team. - What? Hockey. - Hockey? Yeah. He said you were the top scorer. Oh, you're talking gutter hockey. Yeah, we played quite a bit of hockey. Pasi's exaggerating my achievements. - And you never said anything to me. Linda, what do you do for a living? - I work at a bank. Asset management. Some people have too much money, - and we invest it in stocks, bond funds and things like that. We also offer tax advice. Then we just hope the money'll grow. So you work in the care sector. - In a way, yeah. But our clients are neither sick nor poor. What do you do? - I sell beer at the local bar. That's awesome. - She sells it very well. Oh, honey. Okay. It'll start soon. - Yeah. ELECTION This is an MTV3 news election special. Good evening. We'll be covering the election returns in this special broadcast... Okay, here we go. Both parties have 9 seats. Where's Janne... 7 votes. At least my family voted for me. And a couple of other people. Sure we'll go to the bar anyway? - Of course. The count isn't over yet. And our campaign event was after the early voting. I'm not sure people knew whose event it was. Okay, friends. The results will be in very soon. What does it look like? - We don't know yet. Now. Janne. Janne. 37 votes. - What a pity. Holy shit. - He's in! Congratulations! - Thanks. The Social Democrats got 10 seats! - Yes! MUNICIPAL ELECTION You're a council member, dammit. - I voted for you. Congratulations! Thanks. - Thank you. Thanks. - Have you heard the Santa Claus story? Don't tell it. - Oh, it's a forbidden story. Sorry. Katariina's calling. I trust you. The Social Democrats got 10 seats. The Left Alliance 8. The Santa story. - I can't tell it. There's nothing bad in the story. Unlike in what Mauno did. - Tiina... What did Mauno do? I'm sure he's talked to you about his dad. - Yes, he has. He told me he died of cancer when Pasi was in Helsinki - and that his mom died earlier. - In Helsinki? Yeah. He didn't tell you he was living with us? No. I didn't tell them anything. They're expanding the Savonlinna mill. They're going to build the railroad in Savonlinna. - What? What about Törmälä? There'll be layoffs. They can't do that. - That's what they'll do. Goddammit. - I had no idea. So everything we did was in vain. All the effort. The fucking election! I made promises. Handed out soup to grannies! It's not Pasi's fault. He didn't make the decision. I can't show my face in town. And now I'm a council member! Fuck! Shall we go? I heard something about your dad you never told me. Okay. You can tell me anything. Okay. Promise you'll tell me later. I promise. I don't think I can do anything right now. I'm hungry again. There's plenty of food. You want me to fix you something? You don't have to. Try to get some sleep. Everything's okay. We won't give up. Oh, hi. - Hi. The lights don't work. - No, it's not that. Mauno didn't pay the electric bill. - Where is he? Somewhere drinking. - He's fucking unbelievable. Do you want macaroni? I made a big batch, since it's Christmas. - Sure. You have ketchup? Or would you rather have sugar and cinnamon, since it's Christmas? What's that? - A starter pistol. Let's go. Santa Claus! Pasi. Pasi. What is it? I'm sorry. - What? Please forgive me. - What exactly are you apologizing for? This is what your dad is like. Give me a hug. Give me a hug. Everything's gonna be fine. Why Savonlinna? Why not Törmälä? - That's thanks to you. Your idea for a railroad was looked into at all the mills, - and Savonlinna was the best one logistically. Just get the layoffs over with. We'll start with 70. 70? - Okay, 50 will do. When they haggle down to 50, they'll feel like they've won something. I guess we can start. Hello, everyone. I'm Pasi Kauppi, - head of domestic plywood production development. I grew up in the apartment buildings on top of the hill - and worked here summers. That's why this mill is important to me. The global market affects a country like Finland - that's dependent on exporting. We have to act accordingly. Get to the point! - That's right! Let's listen till the end and do this nicely. It'll improve everybody's chances. Russian timber duties and EU sanctions are forcing us to... How many people are you laying off? 53. Half of them will be early retirements, - and the rest can seek employment at our other mills. The people in question will be informed personally during this week. Thank you. Get lost. You don't have to worry. - What? I just wanted to say you don't have to worry. Well, that's great. Fuck you. Isn't that good news? What do you suppose the people who are laid off are gonna think? The people who have a family? There's nothing I can do about it. Lay me off too, then. That's what they're paying you for. You're a fucking clown in a suit. I could've stayed here to drink and whine about life. But I worked hard to get out of this damn place. I'm not to blame for the layoffs. - The people who got laid off are? You should be happy you still have the mill. At least there are people to lay off. If not for us there would be no mill. Head of development. Get the fuck out! This ain't nothing. We grew up together. Played gutter hockey. Don't do this to me. Please. I'm sorry. Are you going to take the severance package? If you quit your job, the company will no longer have - any employer responsibilities towards you. The severance package is ten months' pay and a holiday bonus. If we have to fire you, - we'll have to hire you back - if the employment situation changes over the next two years. That is, if you want. The turbulence in the New York Stock Exchange - has slowed securities trading all over the world. The Helsinki Stock Exchange closed in positive territory. Metsäjätti stock soared. Investors saw the Törmälä mill layoffs as a positive sign. The stock climbed... In 1986 there was the Chernobyl disaster. Jarmo Raninen's mother heard about the accident - on her way to the laundry room. She put her laundry basket down and said, - "I guess there's no point in doing laundry anymore." Epidemics and viruses followed. Viruses like HIV - that you could pick up - sitting in the sauna without a seat cover. People were terrified of those things. Then came smaller fears. For example, the damage - caused by a metal object left inside your new microwave. People were afraid of black adders, diadem spiders and lockjaw. People thought spasms were a bad enough thing relaxed, - let alone having lockjaw. Adults were afraid of losing their jobs, interest rates shooting up, - recession, stumpage prices going up and old pop stars' careers ending. Or continuing. Or something else. Some summers were ruined by red pine sawflies. The destruction of forests was a sure sign - that every family in Törmälä would be ruined. People were afraid in vain. When there were a lot of red pine sawflies, more birds were born - and the following summer the situation was under control again. Daddy could also take a bath. You smell. Bad. Little frogs, little frogs They're so funny to watch Little frogs, little frogs They're so funny to watch No ears, no ears They don't even have a tail After a pleasant youth After a troubled old age The earth will have us The earth will have us Get up, for fuck's sake. Fucking drunk. Hey! Get up, for fuck's sake! You missed my graduation! You fucking clown! CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR BIG DAY. LOVE, DAD Why don't I make hot chocolate and sandwiches. I'm sorry. Ugh, never mind. He was a weak piece of shit. He tried. Trying doesn't count. Pasi couldn't make it? Could you give him this. It's not a lot, but it's something. Keep in touch. Stay strong. Hi. - Welcome to Consolidated Forest Giants. What? - We were sold. Who? - You, me, the head honchos, everybody. The meeting's starting. Come. My family had a summer cottage in the Finnish archipelago, - so I know Finnish curse words. All right, ladies and Gethsemane. Metsäjätti has changed its name to Consolidated Forest Giants. From now on, "CFG" will be written on your paystub. That's the only change caused by the merger. That's what the head office promised. Our jobs might actually be even more secure. The mill isn't profitable. - It's more profitable than ever. No, it's not. If it truly is, we have to recalculate. What's the real reason? Why Törmälä? - Don't play dumb. I'm sure you understand we laid people off to sell Metsäjätti. We're one of the big boys now. - So what? We made a deal. The global deal - required everyone to close one mill. Shit... Shit. So I'll go to the mill and just pretend we're laying people off? I didn't come up with the law. If you had, there would be no employment relationships. Yeah. But you'll notice this change in your paycheck. I don't want it. - When I had my first child, - I wanted to make the world a better place. I bought organic bread - and was convinced five nuclear power plants instead of six were enough. You're quite an activist. I'm a bit disappointed in you. I'm disappointed because you can't see the big picture. Part of the big picture is that you give nice numbers to the owners. There's something good too. We're investing in our Uruguayan mill. That'll make people in Törmälä happy? - Forget Törmälä. Where's your global solidarity? Didn't they teach you - in business school that we're all equal? You, me and Jorge. Who the fuck is Jorge? - He's some Uruguayan mill worker - who wants to buy the same things Törmälä people have. What do Törmälä people have left? They have a trampoline in the yard and a cheap living room set. The Törmälä mill doesn't deserve to be closed. Okay, maybe not, but this is pure mathematics. Get yourself together. Törmälä is your responsibility. You'll represent us in the media. I won't do it. It's your job. Pasi. Soon you'll know how to convince people in your sleep. In interviews, you'll repeat the word "bio" ten times - and the word "develop" five times. - How about "biodevelopment"? If you manage to convince people you're something, - you'll be that for the next 2,000 years. Like Moses. Metsäjätti merged - with Consolidated Forestry, a Swedish company, - and Consolidated Forest Giants was born. What does this mean for Finland? Are we going to see more layoffs? This merger was our answer to the latest trends in the market. We'll review our strategy and scrutinize production - at all our mills, both in Finland and abroad. I have a document - that tells about the closing of the Törmälä plywood mill, - even though the mill's management hasn't been informed of the layoffs. Pasi Kauppi, doesn't that sound illegal to you? That can't be true. I'm sure you have false information. I got this document from your colleague. It has dates, severance packages and recipients' names. It was signed by you, Pasi Kauppi. Shit. I don't know how... - Let's stop for a moment. Good. It was going okay until you took this document. Okay. Okay. - This paper isn't worth your attention. The document doesn't exist. It teaches you to expect anything. Yeah. - Let's do it again. Ask the chief union steward to come here. Your turn. Did you say everything you were supposed to? Yes, I did. It's starting, honey. - Consolidated Forest Giants - announced today it will close its Törmälä plywood mill. Demand has decreased globally, - and we were faced with challenges in competitiveness. What now? - Go, Kuisma! It's possible I'll get drunk. I'm getting there! Why was the Törmälä mill closed? - Piss Pasi! It was closed because nothing is worthwhile. At least not enough. Our profits must increase constantly. We felt this was a necessary development. - Blah, blah. Bullshit! My dad worked in this mill in the 80s. He was laid off in the 90s, and then he drank himself to death. I'm not blaming the markets, but these things have an effect. Times always seem to be hard and that's when you see - what both people and companies are made of. Sometimes they both have to compromise. The workers should look in the mirror, - but the company's owners should also think about their ethics. - Right! We should make sure we make it through the tough times together. Selfishness and self-interest are virtues in these times. Companies aren't taking social responsibility. This kind of society is bound to collapse sooner or later. Törmälä collapsed today. We killed it. I've done media training. I can help you if you want. I'm sure you want to know how necessary the closing was. Yes. How necessary was it? - Good question. If 10 percent profit isn't enough, then it was necessary. May I say hi to someone? I want to say hi to my little daughter. I hope she makes it in this world. We witnessed this outpouring today - when the closing of the mill was announced. Why didn't you tell me about your dad? I don't know. I didn't want to. And then it was too late. What else haven't you told me? Linda, honey. Don't. Dad, he hasn't told me anything. I don't know. Can't you understand? Okay? I'll see you in a minute. Okay, bye. Sweetie, let's go. We're going now. Linda. Don't let them walk all over you. Say yes. I have better things to do. Since this is a multinational company, - will you also translate this? Fuck you. I understand unemployment may feel daunting, - but you have to focus on the future. I have three rules. One: face your fears. Two: Accept yourself. You have to fail in order to succeed. Three: Your posture speaks more than words. Go ahead. - I can see your posture is good, - but my posture is shit. I can't learn a new trade or learn new things. And even if I could, who would hire me at this age? METALLICA. WORTHWHILE? It's never too late. Tough times need tough guys. Are you tough guys? Today you'll learn to walk on burning coals. If you can do this, - you can create a whole new life for yourself. You can do anything. Okay. Who wants to go first? Should we wait for the flames to die down? METALLICA. WORTHWHILE? What? Nothing. Welcome. 125 beautiful square meters. This is unique. You won't find another one like this anytime soon. Look. Wow. Sorry, honey, I have to answer. Well, what do you think of the view? What? Dad. This is Sofia. Everything's gonna be fine. One of the chapters in Guinness World Records is entitled - "human achievements". It tells us of the first people on the Moon - and who ate the most hot dogs. But the makers of the book forgot the most important thing. They don't understand what kind of equation the world is, - the world where Guinness World Records is written. We're a pretty motivated species. We get up every morning. A bus driver drives people to work. Bosses boss. Drunks drink. Store owners sell products. The world has been divided into countries - that communicate and trade with each other. Mostly peacefully. It's unbelievable that a system like this hasn't collapsed. That should be in Guinness World Records. I don't know if it would be classified as a human achievement. But this is what it would be like: 'A system that seems surreal - and has stayed in one piece - for a relatively long time: Society.' A toast to society. A toast to us who haven't given up. Well? You have news? No matter what the future brings. Pasi Kauppi, Woodgood. We got the deal. We have to hire more people. 10 to 15 more. Törmälä first, then the world.
