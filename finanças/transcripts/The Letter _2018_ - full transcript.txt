Gross. - Then why are you still in uniform, then? - Why are you home so late? - Don't change the subject. Why were you going through my stuff again? - You're lucky Mom's working till 10:00 tonight. Gives you time to "study" some more. - [chuckles] Maybe I will. But did you notice Mom left a note on the fridge? I think it said she'll be home at 5:00 p.m. Psych! What do we have here?

I have a feeling it may be-- - No. - But Rogelio, this may be our chance to-- - Shh. - I really think that this will-- - Shh. - Be from-- - Shh. - Papa! - Marcela, if Mom hid this from us, then it was for a good reason. This is way beyond your mental capacity. I'm gonna hold onto this. Or maybe I should just give this to Mom instead. - Rogelio... - Leave this to us adults. ♪ ♪ - Come on.

Do you promise to keep this locked in your heart till death do you part? - Yeah, sure. - Cross your heart. ♪ ♪ Okay. So I've been doing some research, and I think I may know a bit more about Papa than you, Rogelio. Remember Papa's first letter last summer? He never really mentioned who he was working for, but sent us these gifts from San Diego. He sent me this penny with a boot on it. And you got a deck of cards with cheerleaders on them. - Wait, how did you-- - I found it under your bed. So I decided to keep it in the name of research. Anyway, Papa's job, according to him, was in Los Angeles. The only place that has these has to be a place known for cowboys. The cheerleaders on your cards aren't just any cheerleaders, but they're Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders. Pretty weird gifts from San Diego, wouldn't you say? A few weeks later, I snooped on Grandma telling Mama that Papa was muy misterioso. A very strange response, wouldn't you say? So I decided to dig a little deeper. I looked into his drawers, and sure enough, I found his suit and briefcase. - Dad doesn't own a briefcase. You mean his tool kit? - I'm pretty sure it was a briefcase. - That's ridiculous. When has Dad ever worked an office job? - Sure. Tool kit. Whatever. Point is, it was missing. Two important items of business, wouldn't you say? At this point, it all started to make sense. - What are you getting at? ♪ ♪ - Just imagine it. Always on the run, traveling to cool locations... ♪ ♪ Fighting henchmen. ♪ ♪ Knowing secrets that could destroy lives. - Wow. - I knew I had something. - You, uh... you really got me there, Marcela. I definitely thought you were going somewhere with this. - But it's true. It's just like the movies. Here, there's more proof. - I think I've seen enough. This just confirms what I already know. - No, but listen. It explains a lot. - This explains nothing. It...it's not real. - Him not calling anymore or having time to write, he's trying to protect us. - If he was trying to protect us, then he'd be here right now. - Stop saying "was." He's still here. He's still trying. I don't understand why you never missed him. - There was nothing to miss, Marcela. He was never here for us when he was here, and he was never there for Mom either. - Where are you going? - What's your damage? - If you think Papa's as bad as you say he is, then you're not too different from him. - Then look at the letter, Rogelio. - Just shut up and leave it alone! - I won't. Quit acting like a coward and admit that you care about him. - He stole Mom's money. - What? - Do you want to know the truth? Screw reading the letter. Do you want to know why Dad stopped writing to us? Do you? Well, if you searched hard enough, you would've realized that Dad did take his tool kit and his suit. He also took all the money in Mom's savings bag and lied about paying it back when he got to the States. - What are you talking about? He sent us money. - What, once or twice? Everyone knows that when you go to the U.S., you don't come back. How don't you see it? - That's not true. - Everyone knows the truth. The whole neighborhood. Everyone but you. - No, but Papa-- - Get it in your head! He's gone! He started a new life with a new American woman... ♪ ♪ Having the time of his life... ♪ ♪ - You're lying, Rogelio. - Kissing good night his new, blonde kids. - Shut up! - He's a lazy coward, and he forgot all about us. Grow up! - Stop it! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Leave me alone, Rogelio. I don't want to see you. - Please, just listen to me. I didn't mean to act like such a... I'm sorry, Marcela. - That's because you are. Did you just come back here to tell me more about Dad having fun with his white family? - That's not true. - What? - I read the letter. I was wrong. - What did it say? - Remember how you said Dad may be traveling? Turns out you were pretty close. Dad's been traveling from town to town, trying to find better-paying jobs along the way. Seems really happy getting to experience and explore the U.S. - But? - But, sometimes, when you have something so good, it... can be hard to let go of. Sometimes, that decision can turn your whole life upside down. Dad made a dumb decision. He was letting us know that this was gonna be the last letter we'll ever receive. It was his good-bye. - I don't believe you. I-I don't-- it probably meant he's coming home and can't write at the moment. - I'm so sorry, Marcela. ♪ ♪ We're gonna be okay.
