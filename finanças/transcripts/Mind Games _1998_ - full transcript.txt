I don't know why you didn't show. [sighs] I know you're angry with me, but.... don't do this. After what we were to each other, I... I thought you'd be happy for me. We have to talk. I... have to talk. Please. [beep] [engine revs] [screams] [laughter, indistinct conversation] That's great. Oh, you look wonderful. Daddy! Daddy! -Hi. -Hi. Hey, hey! Whoa! You're on time, unbelievable. Come on. [woman] Her world is an unlikely mixture of kiwi shampoo and saved whales, banana bath gel and aid to orphans. Her social conscience and profitable products make Virtues America's fastest-growing chain. Success, respect... Hannah Berrick has everything. [cheering and applause] You make more of this than it is. Oh, absolutely, more than you deserve. Well, actually, um... that's not possible. [man] So when do we get to see this? -Yeah, she's gonna make us buy one. -Yep. -All right, they can see it. -They can? -Yeah, go get it. -[couple laughs] Hey there, big guy. You wanna come on downstairs? Your mom and Amy are down there. What you working on? [boy] Nothing much. Well, we're there when you're ready for us, OK? All right. [woman] This is gorgeous! OK, pay attention. Hannah Berrick. [cheering and applause] [man] Come on, Hannah, give us a speech. -OK. -[husband] Give it up. [laughter] [Hannah] Well... Virtues hasn't been a solo act. Everyone here has played a part. Uh, my team... Cora, Jeff, Jennifer... [chuckles] ...and, uh... especially my husband and my kids, for putting up with my absences and my obsessions. Without them... without all of you, uh... [woman] Oh! [murmuring] [woman, distractedly] It just came out of the ceiling! -What is it? -[woman 2] I don't know. [worried murmuring] Luke! Come on. Tell me, Luke, how's school? How are you doing? You OK? Yeah, I guess. [Doug] Luke, pay attention. You're a football fan, right? Remind me. Uh, Bears, isn't it? [Luke] No, baseball. [Richard] Ah, Cubs, I forgot. Yeah. You're still doing all these paintings, Luke. [Luke] Well, sometimes. [Richard] I'm wondering about this one. Damn traffic, I'm sorry. You wouldn't believe Michigan Avenue. [Richard] It's OK. [Hannah] Sorry. Keep going. [Richard] You see, this one looks different from some of the others. Mother arrives late, doesn't greet the son. Sits with her body away from him. [Richard] Hey, Luke, uh... Tell me about this, uh... this fire. Uh, it's just... just fire. [Richard] Yeah? Well, uh, who is this, uh, stick figure here? [Luke] No one. [Richard] No one? [Luke] No one. Anyone. It's just a fire. -[Richard] Hey, Luke? -[Luke, softly] Yeah. Is there something you wanna tell your parents? No. Patient withholds emotion. Shows signs of stress, which increased as the mother arrived. -[Richard] You sure? -Yeah. [Richard] Something you wanna tell me, without your parents here? Note. Could the problem be with the mother? Dr. Ryan, I, um, saw the Berricks were in again. Yes. The son keeps acting up. Behavioral problems. Sudden onset. May be panic disorder. And you've, uh, tested for ADHD? Oh, a bunch of things. We haven't got the whole history yet, but at school-- He can't concentrate, he cuts classes, he can't keep his friends. It's your basic cry for help. It's right up my alley. Thanks. I put Karen Sorenson in on this. She's with him now. You have a problem with that? No. I mean, I guess after everything she's been through, Karen could use some professional support. -There you go. -Our professional support. -Mm-hmm. -Yeah. I can do that. I know you can. All right, I'm pouting. Remind me not to take a vacation. [chuckles] So, would you two mind if we videotaped our session? We use them for our teaching program. -No. -Sure. All right. [Karen] OK. Now, to answer your question. Yes, I will see Luke, and soon. But I want you two to remember that Luke's flare-ups are not isolated. He is part of a family system. Yeah, we've heard all this, but, um... Look, I'm not so sure we even have a problem. It's on and off. He's testing us, it's probably a phase. With this much acting out? Well, he taunts his sister. Uh, the nightmares, the incidents at the school. Even the... even the paintings. Hannah, I don't think he's testing you, I think he's putting you through final exams. Look, it takes time to get to the root of the problem. But we have to admit there is one. Now, you've only been here a few times. Yes, and you haven't even seen Luke. No. But I've seen you. Don't worry. Hey, we're three smart, accomplished adults here. You don't think that we can figure out one 9-year-old boy? Well, one smart, accomplished 9-year-old boy. Uh, I want to, um, cut this short today. I'd like to regroup. We'll call you when we're ready to see you again, OK? [woman] ...and profitable products have made Virtues America's fastest-growing chain. Success, respect... Hannah Berrick has everything. Success, respect... Hannah Berrick has everything. Do you remember when we got this place, how excited we were? -Uh-huh. -You're an architect, you barely inspected it. You said, if we looked hard enough... we could find fault in anything. Maybe we're looking too hard. Well... his school suggested the family therapy. Now, if this is the wrong technique for Luke, I think that we're gonna know soon enough. Do you think we really could be the problem? I can't even remember the last time we fought. What have we got to be scared of, huh? Can't we just wait, hmm? Just... just until my London trip's over? To see if it is just a phase? [Doug] Hmm... Overseas, we're aiming at 12 new shops within the year, eight in London, four in Paris, with the, uh, whole new line, including the Mango Cleanser. -I know you hate it, Jennifer. -[telephone rings] As usual, each shop will pledge a percentage of its profits -to public agencies and, uh... -[woman whispering] ...we started a scholarship fund for teenage mothers to finish school. [woman] You better take this. Excuse me, everyone. Uh, Warwick, will you break down the schedule? -This is Hannah Berrick. -[Karen] Karen Sorenson. We've already set six of the eight sites in London. Didn't you get a note? We're postponing therapy for now. [Karen] I did get it, and... it concerns me. Well, yes, but it's what we're choosing to do. I can understand your impatience. Who wouldn't? But if Luke were physically sick, you'd take him to a doctor, wouldn't you? Well, are you telling me that Luke is sick? I'm, uh, saying there's pathology here that could use attention. Yes, but what does that mean? Ah, nothing, never mind. I'm not pushing. It is your decision. Look, uh, I'll call Doug and I'll call you back. I already spoke with him, Hannah. He made an appointment for both of you at four o'clock. This afternoon? Well, never mind, uh... I'll either see both of you today or not. Just call Appointments and let me know. You of all people should understand. [Karen] Don't you think I do? [sigh] And... I don't think it should be this hard. [Karen] Maybe we should talk about that a little more. Nice of you to consult me on this; where were you anyway? I called. I was at the job site. Look, I know that we agreed to put this off, but it just seemed so important. You know? Forget it, I know you're right. It's just really a mess, is all. Listen... I wanted to thank you for giving me the Berrick case. For your vote of confidence. It's never wavered. You know that. Anyway, how goes it? Well, I'm still evaluating the parents. Especially the mother. You'll update us at the team conference? Yeah. Oh, by the way, they refused videotaping so my report will have to be oral. Really? Hmm. Well, it's their prerogative. Something about this whole process just gives me the whim-whams, you know? But we can deal with it. We're grown-ups, right? Right. Come on. [Karen] OK. So, everything's going along fine, and then... Oh, here. Three years into your marriage, you close your architecture firm and become a foreman of a landscape crew. Right, um... Someone else's crew. But I had no choice. You see, one of our subs screwed up and the client sued. And, well, my idiot partner, he never renewed the insurance, so, uh... we lost everything. Hmm. And that was nine years ago. Oh, right before Luke was born. -No, it was after. -Like two weeks after. Right. And right then Hannah starts her business. What does this have to do with Luke? [Karen] Well, when I reread your case file, it occurred to me that... maybe Luke's birth actually caused some anxiety for you. Resentment, even. Not for one second. It's all right to feel angry, Hannah, even towards your son. I was never angry at Luke. Who, then? Doug? No. We were frantic. No money coming in. Damn lawsuit hanging over us. It was awful. You didn't know how she felt? No. So it was a secret. Oh, yeah. And you, how did you feel? I felt that I had screwed up everything. Like a failure. Maybe I wasn't so forthcoming with my feelings either. How did you handle pressure? Where did it show up between the two of you? Well, it wasn't in our sex life, anyway. [chuckles] We were at it like rabbits. That's attractive. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You want the truth? The truth is, it was rough there, but we got through it, all right? And, uh, now? Do you ever just, uh... touch, hold each other, just to be close? That's never been a problem with us. [Doug scoffs] Can you show me? Um... a hug? [Doug chuckles] Well, if it makes you too uncomfortable... You know, um, at some point you're going to have to learn to trust process. That's right. That's what it will take. Absolute... trust. [Ben] You gotta be kidding. [laughter] Is that normal in counseling? -[waitress] Excuse me. -[Doug] Who can tell? It's pointless, all this talk about sex. You brought it up, Doug. It was a joke, Hannah. You know, it was getting pretty serious in there and I just wanted to interject a little humor. -Now, where does Luke figure in? -[Doug] That's the question. [Ben] Mm-hmm. You know, Hannah, you're probably right. Should probably just take him to a normal child psychologist. [Ben] What? And miss all that hugging? I wouldn't. [Cora] Yeah, listen to him. I suggested we go to couple therapy, he told me to take the dog. -[scoffs] -We learned something about ourselves. It's only good, right? It's total crap. Why are you so down on this? What happened to you in there? -What? -I don't know. Great. What did happen to you in there? Oh, you see, she's got this, uh... way of looking at you. Like she's seeing inside of you. Everything that should just be left in the dark. Absolute... trust. Absolute... trust. Absolute... trust. ...trust. [Hannah] We didn't have money for a nanny, or much of anything else. But you still didn't answer the question. [Hannah] Because... we've been over this. Doug looked after Luke and they became more than close. Yes, after I had him, I became the outsider. Yeah. Sometimes that did hurt. And do you think that you wanted revenge on Doug somehow, for excluding you? Of course not, absolutely not. No. [Karen] Some people say the serpent wasn't really evil. He was just offering Adam and Eve knowledge, plain truth. What most people find so scary. Tell me the truth, Hannah. Tell me your real secret from Doug. I just can't. Come on, Hannah. Talk to me. Luke was two years old. I had a... I had a conference in New York. Luke got a fever the night before, so Doug stayed home. And I met someone. An Englishman. He was a World Health Corps doctor. He was... He was intense and passionate. He just wanted me. It seemed like a hundred years since anyone felt that way about me. [Karen] Have you seen him since? No. I don't even think about him. Just about how guilty I feel. [Karen] Now, do you think this might have happened because you felt Doug let you down in some way? What difference does it make? It happened. I let it happen! But I... only loved Doug. I still do. Did Doug give you that scarf? It's very beautiful. My sister gave it to me. [sniffles] Oh. Well... you're lucky on all counts, then. I always wanted a sister. So... what now, Hannah? What do you mean? My God, you want me to tell him? Well, don't you think that it must weigh in on Luke's problems? Kids take those things in, you know, like a wound, and bury them. Doug would never forgive me. After seven years? [Hannah] It's worse, I never said a word. I'd only be telling him to feel better about myself. -That's wrong. -Wrong? Wrong for the sake of your marriage? For the sake of your son? Suppose he couldn't forgive me? Isn't it time you found that out? Luke. -Come on, give it to me? -What? The lighter, give me the lighter. -Give it. -Fine! Take it. [Doug] What is all this, anyway? This is just swell. Where'd you get this stuff, huh? [Luke] I found it at school. You weren't at school today. Mr. Kerry called. [Luke] Mr. Kerry didn't go today, how would he know? Luke! [Luke] Ask Josh, he knows. Just call him... -...and ask him. -You are really pushing your luck, young man. I need to know where you were today and I need to know right now. [Luke] I told you, I was at school! [Doug] Just tell me the truth, Luke! -Mommy. -[Luke] I did, I told you I found it! -[Hannah] Oh, hi, honey, hi. -[Doug] Where did you find it? What's wrong with Luke, Mommy? He's being weird. He must have a lot on his mind, but he's not ready to tell us. Be patient, he's in a funny age. I don't think it's so funny. No, neither do I. Let's get you ready for bed, OK? Well, he's packing up his shopping spree that he didn't pay for, OK, while he wasn't in math class on a school day that he didn't ditch but his principal did. Doug, listen, uh... We went over new ground today, Karen and I. Yeah, yeah, that's great. You know something, we're gonna take specific action. Maybe we'll make him confess. Hmm? Make him take everything back and face the owner. The angry owner. Where's his number? What do you think? I know how he'll feel. Scared, not sure what will happen. Exactly. We want him to understand that his actions, they have consequences. Doug. What? You can always take something awful and find humor in it. Something I love about you. Tell me you love me, Doug. Please, I need to hear it. [Doug] What's the matter, hon? [Hannah] Doug, please, stop. [Doug] Oh, I get it, I get it now. You felt unloved and unlovable. You thought that you could cure it by taking two aspirin and the nearest stranger. How could you tell me something like this?! -[Hannah] Quiet! -[Doug] What did you expect? [Doug] Who was he, anyway, huh? Some financier? Some groupie from the... So you told him. [Hannah] Yeah. I don't know what good it'll do. Aren't you due to go out of town soon? In a few days, but... Make it sooner. Give him room. You know, Hannah, you really shouldn't beat yourself up about this. What you did took a lot of courage. Doug will see that in time. But for now, I really think distance can help. By the time you get back, things will be different. [nanny] I'll put an apple into these. [Luke] Gimme it. -[Luke] It's mine. -[telephone rings] I want the granola bar. -[ringing continues] -[Luke] I don't like this kind. -Yeah, Doug Berrick. -[Karen] Doug. Karen Sorenson. -[Amy] I might die. -Hold on a second. Jason Adams died because of chocolates. Honey, honey, Jason Adams died because he had a very weak heart, not because of chocolates. Now, I wonder who told you that. -[Luke] Ow! I didn't... -Yeah. About our appointment today. It's Thursday, the day I generally see my patients in my home office. -[music plays, kids fighting] -Hold on a second. -[Luke] I want the peanut butter. -Please. -[music stops] -Uh... Listen, Karen, um... today's not really a very good day for me. So when? Actually, uh... I'm not planning to continue. Well... I understand. Everybody has to decide what it is they can handle. [Doug] I'm glad you understand. I usually like to have a final session with my clients, though, for closure. Now, they take a bit longer than normal, so, uh, just let me check my book. OK, I can make you my last appointment then. Eight o'clock. 432 West Briar. -Uh... -I'll see you then. Um... [buzzer sounds] [door buzzes] Oh, no, honey. Just, uh... When he gets home, just tell him I'll call tomorrow, OK? No, no, I'm still in New York. I'll call before I get on the plane to London, OK? All right, kiss your brother. All right, all right, don't kiss him. I miss you, too, honey. Bye-bye. [Doug] Then I wanna know what made her tell you about that guy, about what happened in New York. Doug... I was against her telling you. Wait a minute, she said it was your idea. -[Karen] My idea? -Yeah. [sighs] You know, maybe we should just give her a call. No. Be wasting your time. She's gone. She left early. I don't understand. Did I... miss something? This what you were looking at? Would you like a little? Sure. So, Doug. Why do you suppose Hannah would pick now to tell you? After seven years. I don't know. Just what I've been asking myself. Thanks. You blame me for this, don't you? I mean... therapy. It has released some demons. All right, if I suggest something, I say a word, you say the first thing that comes to mind, what would your reaction be? I'd say, uh, "You're kidding, right?" Well, I know it's a bit like a comedy skit about therapists, but... I'm not kidding. Try it. Luke. Oh, come on, give it a try. Come on, indulge me. Luke. Uh... Confused. -[Karen] Hannah. -The same. -Success. -Failure. -House. -Home. -Luke. -Love. Hannah? Anger. -[Karen] Amy. -Mine. [Karen] What? Say it, whatever you're thinking. You said that, um... it was seven years ago? That it was seven years ago that she had that affair? You're crazy! You know that? I mean, that's a crazy thought. I mean, what are you saying, that Amy's not mine? Of course she's my daughter. She's my daughter! [Karen] I understand what you're feeling, Doug. I know how much it hurts. Betrayal. [scoffs] Oh... I know how much. But don't be afraid. It'll be OK. It'll be OK. It's OK to be human. Lots of people are. You don't have to worry. I won't embarrass you with a scene. It's, uh, so not me. [sighs] I realize that the relationship between the therapist and the patient is supposed to be based on trust. And I broke it. Crossed a line with you. But I want you to know... that I don't regret it. Not one single second of it. Doug, I, uh... I... I don't know what I'm calling to say, exactly. I guess I'm, uh... just calling, that's all. I don't know why it happened. I... It's been torture carrying this around with me. I know it's... it's hard for you to believe... to believe it when I tell you that it had nothing to do with us. I want us to survive, Doug. I... Yeah, I'm just... I'm just calling, that's all. [phone hangs up] [Richard] All right, moving on. The Berrick family. That's Karen. Karen's report will be oral. They passed on videotaping. OK. I've evaluated both parents, together and individually, and in my opinion, the boy's problems stem primarily from the mother. She's preoccupied with what I call sexual territory. On the one hand, she's convinced that her husband has been unfaithful, and yet on the other, she's admitted in solo sessions she's had several extramarital affairs herself. How many is several? Two or three a year. Puts a different spin on "Virtues," doesn't it? Now, she justifies her own promiscuity by claiming it's the husband who's been unfaithful. She has an almost pathological need to be in control. How was she toward the children? [Karen] Detached. Especially toward the son. She sees her family as an obstacle. I'm worried about that. What? That she'll leave them? Maybe worse. Well, that's some leap after a couple of sessions, Karen. -Isn't it? -Well, maybe not. Karen? [Karen] She has dreams, much like her son's paintings, that she sets fire to her own house. Is it such a leap to see that as a unconscious wish? -[man] No. -[group murmuring] [Richard] And you propose what as a line of treatment? Well, I was hoping for your input. [man] I have nothing. Increase the sessions for continuity, if nothing else, and get the son in with them, yesterday! [Richard] Hold on a second, Wanda. Anybody have anything to add? Oh, uh, one last thing. Uh... Suppose the marriage is beyond saving? The focus of therapy will extend to their relationship and, uh... you'll help them ease their way out. Of course. I'll do everything I can. [man] Good work, Karen. Everybody, Wanda, thanks. [Hannah] Jennifer, fax everyone. Start with London. And if Warwick calls, tell him to give Cora daily status reports. [Cora] He already called from the airport. [Hannah] And check with the airline about my bags, OK? -[Cora] What is going on here? -[Hannah] I need you to hold the fort for a while. Hannah, you left Warwick to handle London, he barely shaves. -You know how hard it was to get funded for Europe. -Was I supposed to clone myself? I need to be here, I need not to be away from my family. If you were married to Ben, some time apart would seem like a real gift. How do you do that? -What? -You guys battle all the time. It doesn't mean your marriage is shaky. Exactly. It's a war, but... I sleep with the enemy. I'm losing it, Cora. All of it. -It's just slipping right through my fingers. -Oh, sweetie. [Amy] Dog. [Doug] Dog named Mick. ♪ And if that dog named Mick can't talk ♪ ♪ Daddy's gonna buy you a... [Amy] Doll. [Doug] A doll. Doll that walks. ♪ And if that doll can't walk too far ♪ ♪ Daddy's gonna buy you a... Candy bar. [Doug] A candy bar. ♪ And if that candy bar's... What is it? [sighs] Nothing major. A bug. What happened? Guys from London cancel your trip? No, I did. I did what you always tell me to do: delegate. You know, I really don't think I should, uh... stay at this house right now, Hannah. Doug, I came back so we could try to work this out. I'm going to be staying at the Pickwick Hotel if the kids need me. And if I need you? Hannah... you know, I, uh... I really admire the way that you deal with your anger. It's like this tornado takes over your body and you just let it go and it... blows over. That's something that I thought that I'd learned to do. Something that I thought that I'd got from the marriage. But, uh... you know something? I didn't... I didn't learn a thing. Not a thing. Doug, please. I honestly don't know what it will take to pull through this thing. I don't even know if we can... now. I tell you, though, I know what I feel about that child in there. I don't want her ever doubting my love ever. I have made her mine, do you understand that? [telephone rings] Hello? [Karen] Hannah. Is that you? You're home. Why did I listen to you? Tell me what happened. I didn't go. So he did. So he's left you? Is that it? I don't know, I think so. It... It was so many years ago. What about all the years since, the kids? I said to give him room, Hannah. He just needs time. Karen. Can you arrange for us to see you together? It might help if you're there. He's at the Pickwick. Can you call him? Please? [Karen] I can try. All right, let me try. Let me see what I can do. [hangs up phone] [exhaling loudly] [bartender] Thank you, sir. -Two out of three. -Catch you later. -[Karen] Vodka martini, please, double olives. -[bartender] Yes, ma'am. [Doug] Wait a minute, don't tell me, you were just passing by. Be careful what you wish for. I thought you could use the company. My mistake. Maybe we both made a mistake, Karen. Do I scare you that much, Doug? You know, I was, uh... just thinking about what you said. Martini, two olives. About, uh, breaking a trust. And I don't think that you broke it for me. Not at all. I think you did it for you. [Karen scoffs] [Karen] You were my occasion of sin, Doug. And I was yours, no more than Hannah's. We came to you for help. I understand your anger. She's taken everything away from you, your self-respect, everything. It isn't fair. Now, sometimes a marriage has to be destroyed in order to save the individual. So, was that your treatment? Was it... save me and kill us? Is that what you were going for all along? [Karen] No, no, Doug. No, it's over. And I can help you face it. Yeah. It's over. What am I gonna tell the Family Therapy unit, that even with the sex, the therapy was a failure? Huh? Too many meetings. You packing it in early? Uh, sorry, pal. I'm not going to any meetings. Jack Stonehill, the Hedge Fund Seminar. You're, uh... Doug Berrick. And, uh, you got the wrong guy. Maybe so. [doorbell rings] Hi. You're Luke, right? I'm Karen, from the Family unit. Is your mom here? Yeah, she's upstairs. I'll go get her. OK? Mom? [Karen] Oh. Hi. I'm so sorry to barge in so late. Uh... I hope I'm doing the right thing here. Did you, uh... You spoke to Doug? [Karen] Yeah. Yeah, I did, and maybe it was just the liquor talking, but... We all have... a shadow side... a dark part of ourselves that we don't want to look at. Doug has been living under that shadow. Maybe all of you have. You're scaring me, Karen. [Karen] Doug says that what's happened in the marriage is his punishment... for what he's done to Amy. Now, I hope to God I'm wrong. But I couldn't... just couldn't let it go. But he adores Amy. It's how he proves his love to her, Hannah. Physically. Now, have you ever noticed anything? How he touches her? Does he make excuses to be alone with her? Some little clue? Look, I know you've been busy with your career, and sometimes the mother is the last to know. Why are you saying this? [Karen] Because I have a duty to that child up there, and so do you. I want you out of my house. Do you hear me? Leave now. It's unspeakable, Hannah, I understand that. And your denial is natural, but if there's a tiny chance-- Did you really think I could share my life with a man and not see something like that? Hannah, look, I know it's not... It happens. Even in the best of marriages. Not in this one, not in mine. [Karen] You're forcing me, Hannah. I'll have to make it official. I'll have to go to the courts. You do whatever you want. I listened to you once. Never again. It takes about two minutes to get out that door and through the yard. I'm giving you one. [door rattles] That lady downstairs... did she come about me? No. Not about you. You remember that? Best fastball for a dad. Where'd he go? He just, uh... He had to go away for just a little while. Don't worry, it's just, uh... just a work thing. Lie down, OK? You know, when, uh... When you love someone, Luke, you have to believe in them. And you have to keep believing in them or it can all fall apart. Love isn't... something that survives or doesn't, it's... it's an act of will. You know what I mean, jelly bean? Oh, there you are. I need your case notes on Berrick. The mother's asked for a meeting. No, no, no, no, that would be a huge mistake. -Richard-- -Good morning, Dr. Ryan. Don't buy into this. The woman is a control freak, I told you that. Now... I know I'm gonna break through with her any minute. I just need to run with it a little longer. Karen, I can't risk another inquiry. I have responsibility here, to the patients and the unit. Well, and maybe to me? Just, just a little? You know, I've, um... I've really missed you. I want the records on my desk tomorrow morning, all of them. And I want the whole family in to see the team. [school bell rings] -[Luke] Wait a second. -Right. It's about time you and I spent a little time together, what do you say? How about some ice cream? I don't know, the guys are waiting for me on the bus. Or we could talk in my office with your mom and dad hearing every word. Pick your poison. I'm sorry your dad couldn't pick you up today. I know he wanted to surprise you. [Luke] He never said anything about that. He had to go away. For work. [Karen] Is that what they told you? That's... that's what my mom said. Come on. [Karen clears throat] Do you know why your parents want us all to talk? Luke... Your dad has left home. It's all because of me, isn't it? [Karen] Yeah, I know it's been tough on you. It's been tough on all of you. For your dad being out of work. He has a job. [Karen] Supervising a landscaping crew? He hates every minute of it. The only reason he's doing it is because he's too proud to live off your mom. And, and with her gone all of the time, he's left being a babysitter. Dad likes taking care of us. Oh... look. You see, Luke, sometimes, when married people have to do things they don't wanna do, they sometimes wind up hating each other. Kids like you get caught right in the middle. [Luke] Then what'll happen to me and Amy? Who knows? But your parents don't strike me as the kind of people who would get divorced and just ship their kids off to a boarding school. It's OK to be angry, Luke. I had parents. I know what it's like to get angry at parents, to want to get back at them for something. You've got to learn to trust that anger. It can help guide you. It can be your friend. Like me. Oh... You had me so spooked. What, did Coach Byrum keep you after again? -No. -Luke, you know... You know that I am constitutionally unable to have to sit and wonder where you are. -Sorry. -Hey! Hey! Take your stuff up with you. Fine! Doug? [telephone rings] Yeah. Just picking up a few things. Hello. Yeah, London. Hello? Warwick, you gotta hold firm, it's a bluff. If you come unglued, they're gonna nail you. You gotta tough this one out, OK? I can't talk now. I gotta go. -[phone beeps] -[Hannah hangs up receiver] [Hannah] Sorry. Think I just fed Warwick to the wolves. There's no need to apologize, Hannah. A little late anyway, right? Doug... We have to talk. About the therapy, about what it's doing to us. I know that. I would do anything to undo the damage. Anything. Just tell me how. It's not just you, Hannah. Whatever's on your mind, just say it, already. There's something that... I have to know. And it has to be the truth. Go. Is Amy mine? It came up in a session with Karen and I need to know about it. [Hannah] How she can just walk right into our lives and... It's not just unprofessional, it's misconduct, it's-- -[Doug] It's revenge, Hannah. -[Hannah] Against who? For what? I slept with her, Hannah. The day that you were on your way to London. Oh, my God. -Wanna play a game of poker? -[Doug] It just happened... -[Doug] Because I was angry... -What for? [Doug] ...and I couldn't say no, just like you. Is that supposed to make everything all right, -that you let it? -No, like you let it. Like you let everything else screw us up, Doug. You were weak with the insurance, weak with the bankruptcy-- -You know that that was not my fault! -The hell it wasn't. You were the senior partner! [argument continues indistinctly] [Hannah] You blamed me for my success, what was I supposed to do? Somebody had to work while you were sitting around at home drowning in self-pity. [Doug] Everything that I had ever planned for, Hannah, it was all shot! Take some responsibilities, Doug, for God's sake! You made a mistake, it's not a crime! I am sick of the secrets. I am just sick of this pretense! Enough! [Hannah] So you slept with her to punish me? -What, so I could suffer too? -No. Well, you got what you wanted. [Doug] Hannah. You can ask me about Amy when all the time... -You bastard. -Hey, wait a minute. Where are you going, huh? She's ours, she's part of us! I loved you! [smoke alarm beeping] No, no, no, call 911! [fire crackling] OK. -I'm being gentle. -Ow! You wanna tell me about this? You might not think much of me as a mother, Luke... I do too. Will you listen to me? You know, sometimes, uh... sometimes I come into your room and I just watch you sleep. And when you were inside me, I used to put on Peter Gabriel. And I would sit there with my hands on my belly so I could feel you kick. You couldn't see those things. Maybe I just didn't show you enough how much I love you. Maybe I, uh... maybe I needed to tell you more. I might not be the best mother... but I am not the worst, and if I'm going to get better, I need you to help me. I can't do it alone. She said that you'd send us away to boarding school. Who? Who said that? [Luke] Karen. She says when parents get a divorce, they ship their kids off to boarding school. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I want to file a complaint. An official complaint. -Based on? -Professional misconduct. Specifically. What? Karen Sorenson slept with my husband. She also tried to convince me he'd been sexually abusing our daughter. That's, uh... that's some accusation. [Hannah] Oh, there's more. I wish you were the first client that wanted to lash out at the person they think has caused their pain, but Karen Sorenson is an experienced therapist. She's a destroyer. She has to be stopped. She is trained to analyze patterns of behavior. What are you saying? I'm asking you, what triggers your suspicion that Mr. Berrick cheats on you? You make that sound like a chronic condition. No, but it may help you avoid thinking about your own behavior. When a person has a need to be loved or noticed, being promiscuous can fill one of those needs. [giggles] She has you all fooled, doesn't she? She'll say anything. She's there, isn't she, watching us? Listening. Mrs. Berrick, I'm sure whatever you feel about Karen and what you think she may have done with your husband, it's all very real to you. Why? Why are you doing this? I'm sorry, Mrs. Berrick, really, there is no one there. [Cora] Purple. I like this one. You wanna put that in there? -Hi. -[Hannah] Hi. [Hannah] Hi, honey. So... what happened? Did you make the complaint? -[sighs] -[Luke] No! No, I just made a jerk of myself. -Is Doug here? -He's upstairs. [telephone rings] Hello. [Cora speaking indistinctly in background] Hello? Who is this? Hello? [Karen] When you can't see me, Hannah, just know I'm still there. She's used every secret against us like a weapon. Yeah, well, and we keep feeding her the ammunition. Every fear, every weakness. [Hannah] I'm gonna put a stop to this. I want her address. I take it you remember. Yeah. I know. I'll go with you. No, Doug, I'll go. You are not the only person that has been hurt in all of this, Hannah. We can't stay guilty and angry forever. [Hannah] No. Maybe... sometimes we just have to accept our mistakes and... move on. Is that what you want? I don't know. The address, it's downstairs. Wanda, I have to run out. I switched my phones to you. Do you mind? No problem. Listen, if you want, I can sit in on the Berrick case. As backup. You think I need backup? Is that what you're saying? No, I know how it feels to lose a patient; mine was a college kid, too, only she didn't throw herself under a car, she overdosed. I know it just takes time to get back-- Wanda, you don't know a damn thing. My patient had a death wish, and he made that wish come true, period, end of story. Practice on your own patients. I mean, I can feel it. I'm... almost ready for a... real relationship. Aren't I? Is that a problem? [Karen] No, it's fine. If that's what you want. Even if I do... w-we'll still mean something to each other. We always will. We're a part of each other. [Karen] Well, only you can decide that. You think you're ready to say that? You think you have a right to say that? Well, there's... there's nothing wrong with that. Please, just tell me it's OK. It is OK, isn't it? [door closes] -[gasp] -What happened? [Hannah] She had a knife. She would have killed me. -We've gotta go to the police. -Wait, wait, wait! And say what, "Arrest that woman, she's a bad therapist"? -We don't have the proof. -That boy on the tape was her patient, Doug. Right, so was I, Hannah. Don't look at me like that. Let's just go. It's not stopping. It's not gonna stop! -[Hannah gasps] -[Doug] Come on! [tires screech] Wait! Wait! I just wanna talk to you about Karen Sorenson! We'd all be better off if you talked to me. I've seen you before. -[Doug] You been following me? -You know him? [man] At the hotel. But my name... is not Stonehill, it's Wexford. You know something, nothing that you can say is gonna help her. -Let's get out of here, Doug. -I don't wanna help her. I know what she's been doing to you. I know how she's trying to hurt you. I know how she can. She did it to that boy. You better hear me out. What are you, a cop? Once, not anymore. Well, who are you helping? Someone. Who? Doug, let's go. [Wexford] All right, fine, don't talk to me. But you gotta know you're in danger, Berrick. Real danger. Don't talk to me, but you gotta talk to somebody. You gotta talk to somebody who knows about her. Cora. Cora, listen to me. We're not going to be back right away. It is not safe in that house. Can you and Ben take the kids to the cabin, please? No, no, no, don't wait. Right away. I'll explain later. Just, uh... Tell them I'll meet them later, OK, we'll meet them later. Cora? Thank you. [Doug] You know, this whole thing could be a setup. You know what kind of chance we're taking here? [Hannah] A fraction of the one we took in seeing Karen. Don't look at me like that. Can't help it. Just thinking if we can start over. Well, we can't. Right, right, can't be new, not like the first time that I saw you. So moody, logical... crazy... mine. I don't know where that person went off to. [Hannah] This is where we turn in. [dogs barking] Thought you gave it up. No, not the smoking. Just, uh, hiding it. I'm Anna Sorenson, Karen's sister. She said she didn't have a sister. Well, that suits me just fine. Wexford said I should see you. I hope he didn't get your hopes up. Karen is trying to destroy us. We wanna know why. There are no why's. Not with Karen. Oh, it's Hannah, right? Hannah, Anna. See? Something simple as that can be the "why." [music in background] Lucy, turn that down! It's bedtime anyway. [Lucy] All right. [music stops] She's not your shrink? Yeah, she is. I have a private detective, Wexford. He checks her out every couple of months. As long as I know where she is, I'm safe. -You're hiding from her? -[Anna] Do I have a choice? I have two kids in there. My God, that's something beautiful. Karen sees anything beautiful, she has to destroy it. [Doug] Wow. Doesn't even look like her. [Hannah] A suicide pact. My God. Finding your parents dead, it almost makes me feel sorry for her. Don't. You know those toys you get in the gumball machines? For 30 years, my father worked in one of those factories, inspecting them. Never let a bad one get by. Never missed Bible class on Sunday, at Rotary Tuesdays. Trustworthy. That's what they called him. "Trustworthy Tom Sorenson." That was the public face. Private one... whole other story. He did things to us, Karen and me. When my mom would be asleep, he'd come to our room. First he'd just cuddle. Then more. I was away at summer camp and, uh... I came back and found Karen at the police station, all grief stricken. They bought every word. Was she ever a suspect? The whole family is a suspect until they're not. Karen really knew how to play the orphan card. [Anna] Wexford was the investigating officer till he retired. Wouldn't believe it. She charmed the whole department. [Anna] Later... she showed me how she did it. Mother first, one bullet... then him. She put the rifle in his hands. She was proud of it. Do you believe in evil? I mean, that some people are just born that way? Well, my father opened the door to it, but, uh... Karen walked right through and never looked back. How about that boy, the student who died? The suicide? He was her patient. You think suicide just follows her around? Even when there's proof, there isn't any. People just believe her. But you, you're proof. You've never come forward? -[dishes clatter] -It won't work, Wexford. You brought them here to change my mind. The answer's the same. It's been the same, forget it. Just let it go. It's been ten years. I can't forget it. Don't help me, Wexford. Don't help me! You know, she needs to be stopped. Now, we'll do whatever it takes to get you whatever protection you need, whatever it takes, so you feel safe. If I talk... there's no safe harbor. She's made that clear. No safe harbor. Not for me, not for my kids. Sooner or later, she's gonna find you. Oh, no. I don't think so. She doesn't need me anymore. She has you now. Please, Anna. We have kids, too. [telephone rings] -Can I walk on the floor? -Yep. -Thanks. -[telephone rings] -Virtues. -[Hannah] Cora. We found her sister. She's gonna come forward. Karen Sorenson won't hurt anyone anymore. That's great. Look, I'm not gonna get to the cabin until tomorrow. Ben got them there OK? [Cora] Yeah, he was glad to do it, said it would make him more human. -Not a chance. -And he has to head back as soon as you show up, OK? Wait, Ben's got both of them alone? Yeah, your kids are still talking, to me anyway. And one other thing, I got a fax from Warwick. The London end is signed and sealed, Paris next. So he shaped up after all. [Cora] Yeah, well, a little help from a friend. -Thanks, Cora. -[Cora] OK, bye. [dog barking] [car door opens] [closes] [footsteps] Hello, Anna. [knock on door] -[Ben] Oh! -Ben, thank you! Thank you. Your kids are asleep, which is fine. -I was planning to drug them. -[Doug chuckles] Yeah, easy for you to laugh. I got a meeting in the morning. Great. I figure you owe me three years' slavery minimum to repay this. -See ya. -Bye. -Bye. -Thanks. I'll go check on the kids. Yeah. So... is this the deal? I keep looking at you and you look away? You send a fax one day saying that you retained Burns & Burns. I get visitation rights, but the mango and ginseng lines are yours? Is that a joke, Doug? [Doug] Oh, no. No, Hannah, I can't find one funny thing in any of this. And look at you, you're still angry. What happened to us, Hannah? Why did we stop being able to help each other. Hannah. Is it over? I don't know. We created it, we made it happen. No. No, Karen did that. She set out to do this to us. She helped. But she was right, about Luke anyway. He sensed our secrets, he acted out. It's gonna be a long time before he's over that. But we didn't walk away. We hung in. Hey, we woke up every day... and... and we chose to go on. We chose. [Hannah] So, what do we do now? Um... I don't know, um... -Get back in the boat. -How? We sunk it. Only if we say so. We got too much going for us to lose that. We need each other. It's an act of will. You know? I do know. [Amy] Mommy? [Luke] Mom, Dad, get up. Mom, Dad, please get up! [Doug] Luke? Mom, Dad, Karen's got Amy! [Amy crying] Honey, you're gonna have to stop that now. If you don't stop that, something really, really bad is gonna happen to your mommy, do you understand me? -Karen, please! -[Amy crying] [Doug] Karen, what are you doing? Don't come any closer, or I swear I'll break her neck. Karen, please don't hurt her. [Amy whimpering] How does it feel, Hannah, to lose something precious? Like the end of the world? I know... I know about your father, Karen, how he hurt you. Is that what Anna said? Well, she won't be saying it anymore. -[Amy crying] -[Karen] Anna hated my father. But I didn't. She hated what he did to us, but I didn't. The more she resisted him, the more he wanted her, and the less he wanted me. But he loved me, I know he did. Until she took him away. So I had to take him away from her. -Karen, please! -Not one inch closer! -[Amy crying] Mommy! -[Karen] Come on, in the car. [Doug] Karen, let's just talk. Karen, please! -Please, Karen let her go. -[Hannah] Amy! [Doug] Amy, open the door! Unlock it! Hey, Karen! Look out! Uggh! [Hannah] Amy! [Amy screaming] [Hannah] Doug, do something! [Doug] The car, get the car. She's headed for the ravine! She's got my coat. She's got my keys. [tires screeching] [car crashes] -[Doug] Amy! -[Hannah] Amy?! [Doug] Amy! Honey? Amy! Honey? -[Hannah] Amy, honey? Is she OK? -[Doug] I'll go around. [Hannah] Just hold on. -[Doug pulling door] -Are you all right? Hold on, Amy! Get the window. [Doug] OK, OK. I can't reach it! [Hannah] Hurry, Doug, it's filling with smoke! [Doug] Cover her head! -[Doug] I got it. I gotcha. -[Hannah] Go on, honey. Oh, thank goodness! You'll be safe now. Daddy's got you. -[Amy whimpering] -That's OK, honey. You're OK now. [Hannah] Is she OK? Are you OK? -[metallic bang] -[Karen, weakly] Help me. -Karen. -Hannah! Amy, sit there, don't move. [Hannah] Come on, come on. [Doug] Hannah, get away from there. [Hannah] I can't! She won't... -[straining] -[Doug] Come on! It's gonna blow, Hannah! It's gonna blow. Let's get outta here! -Come on, sweetheart. -[Hannah] Let's go. -We're going home. -[explosion] OK, don't look back. There you go. [Karen] Richard, it's me, Karen. By the time you hear this, it will be over. You believed in me, Richard. You were the only one. But you were wrong. See, I can't get it straight. Families and love and... death. It's all tangled up. Why do they love you? Why are you supposed to love them? I only know what I tell my patients. It's an act of will. -Show me. -Oh, right. Well... I redid the master bath. And instead of having the vanity right here, I moved this stud wall out four feet that way. So now you're gonna be staring at me? Don't look at me like that. You know... I don't think I ever stopped. [Karen] The thing is, once you start to destroy your family, you've destroyed a part of yourself. And then... where does it end?
