There once was a fuzzy little town called "Bo". It was a typical town as fuzzy towns go. But at Christmas time, it had an extra warm glow. Sadly, however, that was long ago. Today, everything is just go, go, go. But among all the critters bustling to and fro was a Christmas-loving creature named Beebo. And Beebo loved everything there was about Christmas. The fun and tradition, he made it his business. Including much to this orator's frustration. Taking over the part of the Christmas narration. I la-la-la-la-la-love the holiday Strike the bells, it's Christmas Eve We're one day out, I can't believe We've got so much to celebrate, it's almost wait Recheck the date Yep! The hour are getting fewer I'd hold my breath but I'd just turn bluer. Got my traditional holiday list! Each box gets a check Well, you get the gist I sang Christmas carols, made angels in snow Then offered my finger to help tie a bow I la-la-la-la-la love the holidays It's Christmas time Beebo styles I la-la-la-la-la love the many ways we celebrate this special day There's nothing to sing about, Beebo. Not when it's Christmas Eve and I haven't finished my Christmas shopping yet. Oh, Turbo! Christmas isn't about shopping. It's about so many other wonderful things! Remember when we used to go door to door singing Christmas carols? I have eight hours to get my three children their one big gift, Beebo. I don't have time for these things anymore I'm not la-la-la-la-la listening It's Christmas time Beebo styles I la-la-la-la-la love things a certain way You'll come around, it's just been awhile None of that now, Beebo. I'm to busy finding the perfect holiday meme to send to my followers. Now what will get more likes? Cat dressed as Santa? Or a snowman-fail? Why don't you just send out old fashioned Christmas cards? Do you know how many followers I have? That's a lot of stamps to lick. Oh, but remember how we used to send out together? You'd stuff 'em and I'd lick 'em shut! Dun't fuhget, I gut a grut tung for lucking Chrustmus stumps. There's no time! Look at all the things I have to do first. I'm la-la-la-la-la looking the other way It's Christmas time Beebo style I la-la-la-la-la love things a certain way You'll come around, it's just been awhile Carrots and cookies! What a lousy combination. Don't be silly, Fleabo! The carrots are for the reindeer. The cookies are for Santa. How could you forget? We used to eat the raw cookie dough until our stomachs hurt from eating raw cookie dough. I've got more important things to do. I'm la-la-la-la-la-laughing your words away It's Christmas time Beebo styles I la-la-la-la-la love things a certain way You'll come around, it's just been awhile You may have found, as I was dancing through town That among all the smiles there were one or two frowns But there's no need to worry, no reason for pause 'Cause I sent off a letter to my friend Santa Claus And that's the thing about Santa, he won't fuss or complain He'll be on this dilemma just like candy or cane I love how la-la-long this songs going for It's Christmas time Santa never fails I la-la-la-la-la left a word with him I'm sure he reply is in the mail "Dear loyal customer. A form letter. Someone should tell Beebo he needs to take down his Halloween decorations. "Loyal customer"? Beebo, is that you? What's wrong? My wish has been received? "Thank you for your interest"? That's not how Santa talks. First, my friends are too busy to take part in out traditions and now I get an auto-reply from... The North Pole Care Team? What if something's wrong with Santa? I've got to get to the North Pole immediately. And there's only one logical way to get there. Mr. Postman. Take me to the North Pole. Oh, gee, Beebo. I could, but I've got so many holiday deliveries. You wouldn't get there 'til after Christmas. Even express mail. Sorry. I understand. Have a merry Christmas, Mr. Postma... That's... That's some dry skin, Mr. Postman. You should moisturize those hands before they crumble like Christmas! I've got to get to the North Pole to save Santa. Coming Santa! Look out! Coming through! Gotta save Santa! Watch it, kid. I'm trying to deface this poster of Santa. Oh. Sorry, Fleabo. But why would you want to do that? Santa's the best. Because he makes us wait until Christmas for deliveries. Hasn't he ever heard of express shipping? But he's already got a mustache, already has a bear. Can't even graffiti this guy. How about an eye patch, hat and blacked out tooth? Good one! That will get Santa to pay attention to me. I tried writing him a letter, and all I got was this. That's the same one I got. I knew something was wrong with Santa. I was just going to the North Pole to check in on him. You're going to see Santa? Then I'm coming with you. See, I knew you care about him. Care? I want to give him a piece of my mind. Did you say you're going to the North Pole? Yeah, something's wrong with Santa. I'll say! He's got an eye patch and a missing tooth. No, I mean, he doesn't seem himself. Fleabo and I both got form letters from the North Pole so we're going to check it out. Then I'm coming with you! Hop in, I'll drive! You want to help save Santa too? No. I want to get my kids the new Gaming Wow: X edition. Everyone's sold out. I sent a letter to Santa to see if he had any and his reply just said, my wish was received. You got the same form letter? Hey guys, over here! I got a new app that turns everyone into reindeer. You can't post that. My head's a heiny! If everyone's getting these form letters then something is definitely wrong with Santa! That's why we're going to the North Pole to save him. Really? Then I'm coming too! Finally, someone wants to help save Santa. A selfie with Santa is exactly what I need to really go viral! Well, at least I got some friends to join. Hey, gang! We're about to take a trip to the North Pole to get a selfie with Santa. And lodge a formal complaint. And find a Gaming Wow: X edition. But really to check on 'ol Saint Nick! And I will be posting the whole thing on my profile so keep refreshing that feed! Wait! Santa doesn't need to refresh his feed. He sees us when we're sleeping, he knows when we're awake! He hears us when we're screaming from a car! We're coming, Santa! Starting directions to the North Pole. Look at this! A holiday road trip with all my friends! Arrived at: North Pole. Wow. That was closer than I thought. I can't believe we're actually at Santa's workshop! What's up, 'bo hive! We're approaching Santa's workshop. Wow. Snows a lot harder at the North Pole. What is this place? GPS says we're at Santa's workshop. That can't be. Where are the lights, where's the cheer where's the Christmas magic? Welcome to Santa's workshop a subsidiary of the North Pole Care Team please state your business. We're here to save Santa. Playing Oh Susanna. An american folk song. No! Stop. I got this. We're trying to find Santa Claus! "Panda claws" are very sharp... Tell Santa if he doesn't come down right now I'm reporting him to the better Christmas bureau. Letter B, for Burro is a Spanish children's book. This isn't good. If we can't get inside, my Christmas will be ruined. Thank you, Turbo. Can you tell me where to find a Gaming Wow: X edition! Everyone, please! We're not here to complete random chores. "Here to see Santa Claus"? Yes! Searching directory. Please enjoy this music as we put you on hold. We did it! We're going to get to see Santa! See, that wasn't so hard. Sorry. Claus, comma, Santa cannot be found in the directory. You are listening to Beethoven's fifth. Press 1 to continue to hold. Press 3 to hang up. Santa, where could you have gone? It's just not Christmas without you. I did not drive all the way here just to leave empty handed. What am I going to do if I don't hear from you? If I don't check all my boxes, Christmas won't feel magical. Expect me to be this close and not deliver the goods to my followers. Beebo, you're gonna wanna get up. That's a good idea. We'll decorate the Christmas tree. That always lifts my spira... So that's how you make potpourri. Let's face it. The odds were against us from the start. Guys, isn't this the time of year when the impossible can happen? And isn't Santa's magic the exact thing that's missing from this holiday. I don't need magic, Beebo. I need a place to charge my phone. Okay, that was pretty cool. Now we can get some hot chocolate. Hot chocolate fixes everything! Yeah, we don't do that. I can do a minty-matcha-mocha-chocolate a peppermint-pumpkin-prancerchocolate or a candy-cane-coldbrew- fruit-cake-frappe with chocolate. You don't have just plain hot chocolate? If it's not on the fancy new menu, I don't know how to make it. But I think the new guy does. Santa! That's what the name tag says! Santa, we were so worried about you! Can I get a selfie! I need a Gaming Wow: X edition. What right do you have to climb down my chimney every year? Everyone, wait! Santa, what are you doing here? We got these weird form letters and went looking for you but you weren't at your workshop. That's because I was... kicked out! Hey, who swapped out the music again? 'Supposed to be the Holiday Jams, not classical. You were kicked out of your own workshop? There's an elf, he's a mad man. Or maybe he's a genius, I don't know. His name is Sprinkles. I'm sorry. "Sprinkles"? Oh. There he is. Wow. Look at all those followers. I could learn a thing or two from him. See? Maybe I'm the crazy one. What do you mean? Sprinkles had a plan to modernize the North Pole. Make it more efficient so we could get more done. Seemed like a good idea at the time. He made some cuts. Got us ahead of schedule. Even convinced me I could take a three day weekend. But when I came back? He had cut the elves, the reindeer! And even me! Christmas without you? That's like cutting the magic. So you work here now? What choice do I have? I'm locked out of my own workshop! But hey, with some hard work, maybe I can become employee of the month! If I can just wrestle it away from that perfectionist, Jack Frost. Well, Santa, If I could cash in one wish it would be to have the magic returned to Christmas. And to get a hot chocolate. Not necessarily in that order. Oh. Sure. Coming right up. Guys, Santa needs our help. Well, at least he has a job. He's seasonal, by the way. We tend to lower our standards around the holidays. What's so bad about Santa? Please. Have you seen his belly? Shakes when he laughs like a bowl full of jelly. Nearly wrecked the place. Here we go! Hot chocolate for all! I know, I know. They make me use chestnut milk. Chestnut milk ruins everything. This isn't right, Santa. We have to get you your old job back. I appreciate you trying to save me, Beebo. But it's not 'ol Saint Nick that's in jeopardy. It's Christmas. At least the Christmas I knew. But maybe... maybe it's time for a change. No! These are the things that make Christmas magical. And they get their magic from you! It's okay. There's plenty of things I can do. My skills aren't limited to just Christmas things, you know? Besides, maybe it's time I tried something different. I wonder what I'll do for Christmas this year I'll watch a streaming service. There's plenty, I hear The local theatre tribe Will give a hefty cheer When I finally agree to star in King Lear And oh! At final curtain, I'm absolutely certain I'll shower cast and crew in gifts with bows That's kind of Christmasy, isn't it? But that's okay. I'm sure that anyone could fill in your shoes We'll get the Easter bunny, what's there to lose? He'll dye the ornaments In springtime pastels We'll all sing Jingle Carrots Instead of Jingle Bells And oh! On Christmas morning As the kids awake all yawning They'll find their gifts were hidden round the yard Bizarre Well, maybe at first, but it might catch on. 'Cause I'm sure I can be useful, outside of my norm I'll go back to school and live in a dorm Should I get a math degree? Already I am torn I'll pledge fraternities. Get the admissions on the horn And oh! At graduation, they'll think I'm a sensation When I make the dean's list of nice girls and boys Oy! That's kinda like my naughty nice list, huh? Yep! But you make a real good point We don't need you at all Kids can wait in line for Cupid When they visit the mall 'Cause every child's dream Is to have their gifts delivered By a naked boy with wings and an arrow in his quiver So no! I see no issues With a kid I know might misuse The mistletoe that's hanging 'bove the door Sure! You go ahead and do your thing. We'll be fine here. I was simply saying I might be better suited for something else. Then go for it! We got this! I think I see where this is going. So you'll be in better hands? We'll be fine this season You'll ask a leprechaun? It stands to reason And instead of yelling out, "On dancer! On prancer!" He'll yell out in a brogue, "O'Donnell! McMaster!" And O'Shonnock, the team leader Whose nose will now glow greener? Will trade in Christmas treats for Shepherd's pie I cannot stand for this anymore! It's all wrong! Santa is what makes Christmas so special. And nobody can do what I do! So I know what Santa Claus is doing tonight He's festive! He's merry! He's handsome! Yes, very And I'll deliver children's presents Tonight Yay! Oh, Beebo! You were right. There's no way I could give up Christmas. What a silly idea. This is what I was telling you about! It's about a 5.3 on the jolly scale! Someone needs to update that poem to say "shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jackhammers." It's a medical condition. Sorry, boss. Let's get down to business. If we want to put the magic back in Christmas then we need to put Santa back in his workshop. So our first move will be... To figure out where he stores the Gaming Wow: X edition. Sorry. Force of habit. That's probably number three. Maybe four. Guys, we're over-thinking this. We just gotta remind Sprinkles that it's Santa who keeps the magic in the holiday. How will we even get in there? Santa's the last person he'd let get within a mile of that place. He'd need a disguise. And we couldn't even get in the first time. How are we supposed to do it now? I'd like an extra-extra large fruitcake frappe. And megasize it. I have an idea. This disguise is great. How did you ever come up with it? Let's just say we had a feeling it would suit you. Welcome to Santa's workshop, please state your business. Coffee delivery for a Mr. Sprinkles? An extra-extra large... Press 2 to enter. That wasn't hard. I thought you said that was gonna be hard. I have pairs of pants that are harder to get into than that. Oh my! Get a load of the new North Pole. This is the North Pole? It's so... sterile. Definitely not photo-worthy. This place makes even me look cheery. No magic at all. Where are all the homemade toys? I love you! I love you! Machine-made? And what's with that dopey voice? - What? - Nothing. Do you all feel that, or is that my third triple latte kicking in? Coffee intruder. Now if I simultaneously launch a second set of drones in the eastern hemisphere those Christmas gifts will be delivered in half the time! Another letter to Santa. It's amazing he got anything done with all these interruptions. Sorry, Hendrix! No time to read your Christmas wish but my Elfin-Mark-V will figure out exactly what you need! Coffee alert! See? He knew what I needed before even I did. I'd love a coffee. Christmas crackers! Who could possibly lift something that big? Santa Claus! How did you know it was me? You look exactly like our new limited addition Santa-as- snowbuckspirate-Christmas ornament. What are the chances? But how did you get past security? I had help from some friends. Ta-da! So you've swapped out elves for furry monkeys now, huh? We're here to bring the magic back to Christmas! Where's the singing, the decorations, the holiday cheer? And where's the Gaming Wow: X edition. Sorry, we're gonna get to that, Beebo, do your thing. You're ruining Christmas. According to who? According to us! Christmas just isn't the same without the carols and tinsel and... The Gaming Wow: X edition! I agree, this was a much better time to bring it up. Efficiency is the new magic. And it makes people even happier. For example, you're looking for an Gaming Wow: X edition? There it is! My quest has ended. See? Another happy customer. Not so fast, Sprinkles. I have a number of complaints for you. - First of all... - Hold on! I want to address everyone of them so please file all your complaints in my suggestion box. A suggestion box! For complaints! And suggestions. But also complaints! And before you upload another single post, my fine furry friend I suggest you download my new app: Sprinkedin. Once you have it you will instantly be connected with all my millions of followers. It's a Christmas miracle. I now have over a million followers. Oh my goodness, I have got to DM them all a hello at once. Now Santa what were you saying about the world missing your version of Christmas? I'm spreading holiday cheer faster than you ever could! But at what cost? I know you're trying to help, Mr. Sprinkles but Christmas isn't about machines and computers. It's about magic. Not about machines? Have you seen the lawn decorations people put up nowadays? I think they're gonna be fine with a giant robot elf. Especially when they see what he can do. Elfin-Mark-V! Wrap those presents. Wow. He even went with a flattened victorian tri-fold. Impressive. But I like wrapping presents. I don't want it to be fast. I want it to be memorable. Then you're out of touch, kid. I know what Christmas is all about. Joy? Togetherness? Cuddles? No, stress! The shopping, the decorations, the obligations. It's too much! But thanks to me, the world is gonna have a very efficient Christmas. Efficiency's the thing that's trending And I've got no problem bending Things that may seem like tradition To bring my new plans to fruition 'Cause that's what I call progress That's what he calls progress Instead of toys for girls and boys Let's just give gifts to kids named... Roy And then next year, so there aren't tears We'll just give gifts to Guineveres It'll go like that for every season You'll get a gift It stands to reason But the time we'll save will be a lot Which is why I fired the elves on the spot And that's what I call progress That's what he calls progress Holiday cards will be swapped for texts I could kiss whoever put "mas" after "X" Let's give an award to the one who invented turducken So get the canned if you want cranberry An efficient Christmas is better than merry And that's what I call That's what I call That's what I call Progress That's what he calls progress Mr. Sprinkles, I'm not gonna lie. That was very entertaining. And you're right! - What? - You agree? So it's okay I keep this? The holidays have become stressful. But I don't think the way to fix them is too throw out the old in favor of the new. I think we need to embrace the things we forgot. See, I believe we actually want the same things. We just see the solutions differently. Wow, kid. You're right. - What? - You agree? - Didn't we just do this? - I am? Yeah. We do see things differently. Sorry. That's one of the filters of the new app. Another thing the Elfin-Mark-V can do? Take care of intruders! Wrap 'em up good and tight. And don't open until after Christmas! So, this is what it's like being a toy. Guess it serves us right. I shouldn't have folded so quickly like that. Now instead of getting a present... I'm wrapped like one. Sorry, Beebo! Yeah. Me too. I was so caught up in the app I lost touch with everything else. And now that you see the damage cell phones can cause you're able to release yourself from it's addictive pull? No, I just don't get any service in here. - Oh. - I regret nothing. Fleabo! This is the worst Christmas ever. But we can still turn it around, can't we? Beebo, there's only four hours left until Christmas. Face it. We failed. But it's Christmas Eve! That's when all the best miracles happen. And we've got the main guy responsible for them right here. We just need the 'ol ripple effect. When you notice others lacking any Christmas joy Start a little ripple Start a little ripple Give it a rest, Beebo. Doesn't need to be elaborate like a present or a toy Just a little ripple There's no stopping him. Just a little ripple A hug! A smile! A wave from a window sill Will pick up speed like a snowball down a hill So, if you don't hear singing from around the Christmas tree Start a little ripple Start a little ripple The feeling is contagious, it will spread from two to three With a little ripple Just a little ripple - Your family - Your friends Even folks you do not know Will feel that spirit rise inside and burst like a volcano And if you're one of the lucky ones who can call Saint Nick their friend Start a little ripple With a little tickle And all your problems will be on the mend Oh, no! Oh. That felt good. We did it! Now we just need to expand that ripple to include Sprinkles. How? We already tried to change his mind and it can't be done! We can't change his mind. But maybe we can change the Elfin-Mark-V! If we can get to Sprinkles' control panel I might be able to reprogram the Elfin-Mark-V to think like we do! You can do that? Please. If I can repost 10 hours of CW content from a third party social platform to fourth party tock-box this'll be a piece of cake. None of those words make any sense to me. So you're saying that if we can get the Elfin-Mark-V to think like us then maybe he'll also fight for us! And then Sprinkles will have to give Santa his job back. It's worth a shot. Then we need to program that robot with all that's good about Christmas. The problem is we need to get Sprinkles away from the control booth. I love you! I think I have an idea. You guys, head to the controls. Turbo and I will take care of the rest. Don't you look cute? Just zip me up! I love you! I love to complain! Why does wrapping paper cost so much when you're just gonna tear it up anyway. Why do Christmas songs get stuck in your head so easily. A bear-jam? You keep wrapping. I'll clear this up. Alright, time to fill this guy with all the best things about Christmas. Like ornaments. And sleigh bells. And snowballs. Oh, and don't forget cuddles. Beebo la-la-love cuddles. Where would you even store ten lords-a-leaping? Well, here's the problem. Are candy canes red with white stripes or white with red stripes? What is with this one? It's working! A proto-type of next year's Gaming Wow: X edition. My kids will lose their minds if I get them that this Christmas. No, no, no, Turbo, don't do it, don't do it. But I have to! What the... You! Turbo, what did you do! Wait a minute. You're not a sweet, soft, cuddly little creature. You're a grouchy, soft, cuddly little creature! Beebo, run! Elfin-Mark-V! Apprehend them! I said apprehend them! What's wrong with you? We just programmed him with all the good things associated with Christmas! Show him, Elfie! Elfie? That doesn't sound good. Joy! Christmas! Presents! Sledding! Cuddles! Hugs! Hugs! No, that's not how hugs work. Here, let me show you. Beebo wants hugs! Or maybe not! Hope you're happy, Beebo. You got exactly what you wanted. 300 tons of pure, unstoppable Christmas joy! Run! Must give hugs! This way! Where are we? Wow! Santa's workshop! I forgot I sealed it up. Amazing. I've got to livestream this. Hey, gang! I am streaming live from inside Santa's workshop. Hugs. Hugs. Hugs. Hey, what's this? Why, that's... That's my crystal ornament. It connects me with kids across the world. Is that how you see when we're bad or good? Sleeping or awake? It was. But it only works when I'm near it, so... it's been off for awhile. Look! Something's happening. Magic. Guys, isn't this the time of year when the impossible - can happen? - That's me from earlier. We've been over this! People don't need magical thinking. - They need smart, efficient... - No, they don't. They need cuddles and hugs. Guys! I don't want to spend my last moments debating the holidays. Who even knows what makes people enjoy Christmas anymore? I like untangling the Christmas lights with my dad. I like staying up late to bake cookies for Santa. What's happening? People are responding. I've been live streaming this the whole time so the whole world knows that Santa can hear them. And they're answering you. I like singing in the car while we're stuck in traffic on the way to grandma's. It's not all about efficiency. I like having a good cry while watching my favorite Christmas movie. And it's not just about hugs and cookies. - It's about... - I look forward to listening for... - I like singing songs about... - I never - miss a chance to dress up like... - I enjoy writing letters to... Santa! It's about you! Not just me. But what I inspire. My ripple effect. But how? My algorithms I programmed them to figure out exactly what people need before they even had to ask. How do you do it? It's not so difficult really. I just listen. I thought if I could make Christmas more efficient I could give people more time for their favorite traditions. I thought I knew what those traditions were. But when I looked at my list I only saw what the holiday means to me. I thought Turbo wasn't enjoying Christmas because she was running around having to shop all day but now I'm realizing that she may actually enjoy that. My favorite part of Christmas is watching my kids open their gifts so running around like a crazy person beforehand has sort of become my tradition. And Tweebo, you seem distracted by your phone all the time, but now I realize you're just trying to stay connected to the people you can't be with. My family lives far away so connecting on social media has kind of become our thing. Our tradition. And Fleabo? Well, you're just a grump. Got that right. Beebo, Sprinkles. You were both just trying to make people happier. And that's not a bad thing! We all just have to remember that Christmas looks different to everyone. Because it encompasses more than just one feeling. From what I've seen in my travels Christmas is made up of all types of feelings: joy, nostalgia, melancholy. Even sadness. So the real magic of Christmas is that there's room for all of it. How about fear? Is there room for fear? I'm afraid we're not gonna be able to stop the Elfin-Mark-V. Nothing can stop the Elfin-Mark-V. Our only hope is to wait for his battery to run out. How long will that take? Approximately 36 hours. Thirty-six hours? But we'll miss Christmas. And we'll starve! No one's going to starve. My workshop always has an endless supply of cookies and hot chocolate. Yes! Hot chocolate fixes everything. Chestnut milk? Chestnut milk ruins everything. Chestnut milk does ruin everything. And I wonder if it could ruin the Elfin-Mark-V. The best way get it into his system is to pour it directly into his main oscillator tube. And where's that? His mouth. One of us has to face that thing? I'll do it. I'm the one who filled that robot with dangerous levels of happiness and joy. I'll be the one to feed him a healthy does of reality. Reindeer, snowmen, ribbon! Mistletoe, garland, cuddles! Cuddles! Cuddles! Wait! I la-la-love cuddling. But how about we start with some yummy hot chocolate first? Hot chocolate? Sure. Drink it down! Detaching chestnut milk, chestnut milk. Did it work? - It worked. - Yay! I told you hot chocolate fixes everything. Oh no, Sprinkles. Your factory. It's been destroyed. I don't care about that, but what about all the toys? How are we gonna fill the wishes of all the girls and boys now? From where I stand, I see a team who can do anything. You guys up for it? - You got it! - You bet! Tonight is Christmas Eve and that means tomorrow we celebrate Christmas in all styles! I la-la-la-la-la love the holidays It's Christmas time Beebo style I la-la-la-la-la love the many ways we celebrate this special day We kept our word Helped every child Made new friends This guy's named Kyle We traveled north Left with a bang Then saved Christmas No big 'thang Now we're atop Santa's sleigh Singing duets So take it away It's Christmas time in Turbo fashion My holidays are filled with passion Shopping has become an art You get in my way, I'll tear you apart Each year I'm back for more and more You see me comin? Get out of the store It's Christmas time - ala Tweebo Still on my phone sending festive gifts but I'm talking GIF's. It's Christmas time Sprinkle's way Lured the reindeer back with Hay Rehired the elves at twice the pay Not a bad way to end the day I'm sorry, but I just don't sing. Plus it's cold up here. But it was quite a trip. And what Santa doesn't see, Santa won't know. Santa sees everything! And while doing-it-all is still a temptation I'm gonna hand back the Christmas narration. Oh wow! My wish has come true. To play second fiddle to a fur ball of blue. But still, it's an honor, for, I'm sure that you've heard the best gift of all is to have the last w... Merry Christmas, everyone! Beebo la-la loves you. Translator: SPECTRA MEDIA
