This is the men's bathroom. Really? Sorry. I know... LULU IN THE NUDE BASED ON THE Some women have kids but they still keep working. Well... Excuse me. Hello, yes? Yes... No, this is the parent company based in Saint-Gilles. You need to speak with our workshops in Angers. Mrs Rouxelle, you're welcome. Hello? Yes, I'm done. I'll be right there. Just start without me. Right. Sorry about that. You know how to use Word and Exel... Yes, very well. Wouldn't it be enough for you to help your husband at the garage? No. I would like to work. You know, I'm available a lot of the time. Even at times that don't suit other people. I can really be very... I have a lot to offer the company. I think I can bring my maturity and my motivation to this company. Sure, and that's something we value in our company. I would really like to work. Very well. I'll be honest, we don't have a job for you now. Alright? But I'll keep your CV safe here and I'll call you if something opens up. - Alright. - Alright? Okay? - Thank you for coming. - Thank you for seeing me. - Can I give you some advice? - Yes? Make an effort. Presentation is also important. Alright, thank you. - Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. Could I talk to the twins? They're at your sister's, I'm at work right now. What are you doing? When will you be home? I'm late! It didn't work out, you know. What? What didn't work out? I was saying that I didn't get the secretary position. I knew it! Did you make a fool of yourself again? You wanted to show off... See you later. Hi, Morgane. It's Mum. I missed my train, I don't know how I managed that. Tell Daddy that... I'll be on the first train tomorrow. Explain it to him so he doesn't get mad. Can you also check on the twins? They have a test tomorrow. Look at their homework, they shouldn't go to bed late. And as for dinner, there's a gratin in the fridge which you can serve with sausages. Well... thank you so much. Kisses, my big mouse. I love you, see you tomorrow. - How many nights? - Just one. - Bathtub or shower? - Excuse me. Is it more expensive with a bathtub? It's 60 euros. Without then. Without bathtub. That's nice. - A Mother's day gift? - Yes! - They're winkles, right? - Yes. So... - There you go. - Does it include breakfast? No. That's six euros extra. - Should I... - No, I'll be okay. - And... - It's on the first floor. Thank you. - Reception, hello? - Oh, no. Sorry! Sorry. Sir? Sir? Sir? Excuse me, have you come across my wedding ring? No, what did it look like? - Which room? - Room number 4. I left it by the sink. It must have fallen down the pipe. The pipe? I'll have a look later. - I'll come back then. - Sure. No chance of finding it down the pipe... You have three new messages. Can you call me back? I don't know what to do! Could you tell us when you're coming home? What are you doing? What the hell are you doing? Where are you? I'm warning you, if I don't hear from you... Cécile? This is Lulu, how are you? I should be asking you that, Lulu. I'm good, I'm okay. How are the children? The children aren't doing great you know. Well about that, I won't be coming home right now. Why not? If you're not coming home right now, when then? What should I tell Serge? I don't know. I'll take two or three days to... But what's going on Lulu? I'll call you back. Sir? Sir? Sir? Oh, no... Sir? Sir? I'm sorry, I thought you were dead. It's important to be able to play dead in life. Hello, I'm Charles. Are you on holiday here? Yes, you could say that. Saint-Gilles is a good choice. With its beaches, weather and the pelicans in the morning! There are pelicans in the morning? - What's your name? - Lulu. - For Lucienne? - No, for Lucie. Lucie? That's a beautiful name. If that were my name, I wouldn't like being called Lulu. I've always been called Lulu. "Mummy, Mummy!" - Sorry. - Is that your children? No, not at all. That's my sister's. I hate it, I thought it was off. I feel like a dog on a leash with this. Really? Then... There you go, the leash is gone. Why did you do that? I'll go get it. It'll just need to dry out. That's not possible! Your husband said the card was stolen. You'll have to wait for a new one. How long will that take? Around 10 days. Alright, thank you. City Centre Garage, hello? City Centre Garage, hello? Lulu? Is that you? - Will you blow me? - What? - Stop it! - Blow me! Are you crazy? Wait! Where are you going? Come on! Just blow me! Come here and suck my cock! What are you doing? I found it! Thank you. - These are my brothers. - Where? This one and that one. - This one? - No, that one. - Hello! - Hi! Hi! - Have you ever gone sailing? - No, never. - What about diving? - No. Water skiing? Skiing on snow is hard enough already... Doing it on water is impossible! I've never skied on water either. But that's what's nice, all these things left to do. Yes, you're right. Yes, I like this. Three or four times a year, I hop on a train. I visit the region. I book a hotel somewhere. I eat in a nice restaurant and I visit the town. I like it. Here, this is it. Well, next time, maybe we could... Sure, okay. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - I didn't find your ring. - That's okay. Thank you, good night. You're broke, aren't you? I am... Does it smell good? - There you go! - Thank you. Careful... Here you go. You don't... I ate with my brothers before we went out. Thank you. You were hungry, weren't you? - Hey! - Hey! Hello! What's going on? Are you cooking? Hi. - Hi again. - Hello. That looks nice. What is it? Do you want to share? I wouldn't mind having a little bite. I'll make more eggs, are you hungry? - I'd like to taste it first. - Let her eat. No, thank you. Go ahead, eat! We can share. - I'll make more eggs. - Just a little bite then! - I'll make more eggs. - Okay. Here, this is my bedroom. I'll sleep in here. Here's the shower, if you want one. I wanted to thank you. You're welcome. Do you want to swap? No, of course not. You need to walk a bit. But it's worth it. Well... Someone broke in here. These people are scum. This isn't the first time this has happened. Criminality here is exploding! It's a good thing we keep watch. - Otherwise... - We keep watch and we punish. There you go, this is for you. - After you, after you too! - Right. - There's a kitchen, show them. - Right. - Right here. - Look at this kitchen! - Isn't it great? - It's spacious. Did you meet someone? Are you crazy? Why do you say that? I'm trying to understand. Just put yourself in my shoes. What are you doing all day? What is there to do in Saint-Gilles? I walk around. I go camping! Is that all you have to say? Camping is nice, good for you. Just so you know, Pablo is wetting his bed again. - Why do you tell me this? - When are you coming home? I don't know, in a few days. It's not the end of the world! Do you think this is funny? Listen, I'll call you back, okay? Kisses. - Sir, madam. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. Pan-grilled lobster served with sherry vinegar on a bed of radishes and turnips, accompanied by a fennel mousseline. Do you really have to yell? - I think it's classy. - Sure. I like it, I think it's classy too. This will all be served with a white wine, a nice bottle from 2004. If you please... Are they always like this? No, only on special occasions. It's stuck. I'll cut the head off... And then... Thank you. Bon apétit! - Is it good? - Yes! I haven't had sex in two years. Why am I saying this? It's been much longer for me. Well... Thanks for this evening. - See you tomorrow. - See you. Good night. - Lulu? - Yes? Err... Is something wrong? - No, I'm okay. - Don't you like me? No, it's not that. - It's just that... - Do you regret it? Not at all! On the contrary! It's just that... I wonder how... How I managed without for so long. - Are you okay? - Yes. - Am I too heavy? - No. Excuse me, madam. Excuse me. I'm looking for the campsite. I don't know where that is, I'm not from around here. Lulu! - Excuse us a minute. - What do you want from Lulu? Who are you? Why are you following her? She's my sister. I don't need your permission to talk to her! We don't care if she's your sister. - Am I dreaming? - We don't want to see you. - Get back to your car. - And who are you? - Hey! - Just do it. Are you crazy? Let me go! - See, this is your car. - We'll tell you what to do. Alright, alright! This is over. - Goodbye. - Goodbye and thank you. Say hello to everyone back home. Oh! And let me tell you one thing. I'll only tell you this once! He's very happy with Lulu. That's all that matters, so you can go. Lulu has three children waiting for her back home and I wouldn't want to start a fight with her husband. - Lulu? - A husband? - I'm sorry but she has no ring. - Right! - She does have a ring. - No. - She doesn't? - No. Hey! Hey! Come have a look! Your sister seems fine to me! That's right! What do they call it again? - Happy? - Happiness! Don't you get tired of following me and staring at me? - Don't you have a job? - What? - Hey! - Lulu has responsibilities! But you don't know anything about responsibilities. - Hey! - Wait! Wait! What did you say? Leave me alone! Hey! - Stop it! - Will you... You watch yourself! You go. Lulu! That was so nice. But so cold! - Can you hear me? - What? - Morgane is coming tomorrow. - Really? - Yes. - Why? How did she find out? You know her, always eavesdropping. She made up a story, she said she was going to a friend's house. I don't know if Serge believed her but he has so much work, he'd rather not have the kids around. What about you? Is everything okay? Well, it's not simple. - Are the boys with you? - Yes, they're with me, of course. - Are the boys with you? - Yes! - Can't you hear me? - Where are the boys? Where are you? - They're with me! - Alright. Hello? Can you hear me? - Hello? - Don't tell her about the man. Of course not. We didn't do much, we hung a little sun over there, we just added a few waves here. Do you like it? - I love it, well done. - It's pretty. Not bad, is it? And the fire too! Just a few things, some colours and all. It's a shame I don't have my guitar. I like to play the guitar. I haven't played for a long time but I used to like it. You know... Charles just got out of jail, he spent four months there. Because... Well that doesn't matter. - What? - Well... Some people aren't happy to see him out. That's the problem. - What happened? - Actually... It was a miscarriage of justice. It was this close to a miscarriage of justice. - We're not quite there yet but... - But that's it. What you need to know is... - He isn't a bad guy. - No, he isn't. Let me tell you, and I won't lie to you... - That's why we're sort of his... - His bodyguards. If the guys show up, we're here. - Then "bang-bang"! - We're his bodyguards. Because for now... For now, he's taken this job at the campsite but it's temporary. It allowed us to stick together in case these guys were to show up. He's in love and that's important. - It's that simple. - But... - Don't forget that. - It's that simple. How do I explain this to her family? Should I say she's having fun with a former convict and that we need to give them time? Convict... Rather miscarriage of justice. Of course. - Well... - It's not simple, of course. Morgane! Did you leave your family too? It's becoming a habit. - I need to explain... - Where's Mum? It's not that simple. - Sometimes grown-ups... - Leave their family. I just want to see her. - Shall we? - Okay. I can't believe it, he's not even handsome. He's fat too. - Mum isn't good-looking either. - Come on! She doesn't have to make a spectacle of herself. - Do you smoke now? - Yes. What does your father say? I don't care what my father says. All he does is yell. Look how this turned out for Mum. - Leaving us for him! - She isn't leaving. It's just a fling, it happens and it's no big deal. Sleeping with this guy is a fling? - Yes! - It disgusts me to picture them. Let's not picture them, okay? - Would you do this? - What? Well, I don't know, leave Uncle. Leave your children and sleep with the first man you meet? Sure, I love sleeping with men like this. Can't we ever talk seriously? Morgane, come on! At least Mum is really going for it. And that will teach Dad a lesson. That's lovely! - Did your mother teach you? - Yes. Perfect. You look like an angel. Wait, I forgot to take off the label. There you go. When I was a kid, I had a trick to become invisible. I'd say I had a switch in my hand and when I'd press "on", I would disappear. When I wanted to be alone at recess, or if I didn't want the teacher to ask me a question, I'd press "on" and I'd disappear, and I thought that it worked. Are you coming? Yes, I'll be there in a minute. My purse! Help! My purse! I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me. I'll walk you home if you want. So you can strangle me quietly in my home? Not so fast! Not so fast. That was the first time I've ever done that. I noticed. I don't know what got into me. You don't look like a tramp. What's wrong with you? My nose is bleeding. Is your nose small or something? Let me do it. There you go. It's out of date. Your pâté expired a long time ago! Don't you think for a minute that I'll throw away food! It's still good. Isn't it good? Isn't it? - Yes. - You see? Hey! Easy on the water! Oh, sorry! If I can do anything for you, please let me know. - Hey! - Yes? - I know what you can do for me. - What is it? I'll tell you tomorrow. Go to sleep. Go to sleep... Here. That's Yvette and this is me. We would tell each other everything. We would do things just to tell each other afterwards. Thank you. I messed up. I messed up badly. I would like her to forgive me while there's still time. So I thought... With your friendly face... And since you don't know what to do with yourself... Err... Could you go see her for me? Sure. But what did you do to her exactly? Err... Something bad. She got really sick. She was in the hospital for a very long time. So... I slept with her husband. Really? - Excuse me? - Are you looking for someone? Yes, I'm looking for Yvette Merle. She doesn't live here anymore. You might be able to find her at the swimming pool. She used to do aqua-aerobics. Where is the pool? You go straight and then left, then it's next to a little café. - Alright, thank you. - Goodbye. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Higher! One, two, three, four. Did you offer him a croissant? Yes, but he only wanted coffee. And you give them what they want? Lower your eyes when I talk. Virginie? Come here! This isn't a church. Hurry up! Straighten up, you look like a beggar. The staff today... Coffee? - Yes, please. - A croissant? No. Excuse me, could I get a coffee? Would you like a croissant? - No, thank you. - Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. - One coffee. - And? - And a croissant. - Just one? Yes. Thank you. - Here. - Thank you. See what happens when you try? Excuse me, ladies. I'm looking for a woman called Yvette Merle. I don't know if you know her. - I've been told she did aerobics. - What do you want? I'm a friend of a friend of hers who would like to know how she is. How she is? You should have asked long ago. - Why? - She's been dead for three years. Really? I'm sorry. Is that you, Lulu? Yes. Could you come help me? I'm in the bathroom. Sure, I'm coming. Come on in, don't be shy. Pass me the towel there. Grab me under my arms. Nice! There we go. On the count of three: one, two... Under the arms, like this. One, two, three... No! No! How do you do this on your own? - Well, I don't take baths! - Alright... Show a bit of gumption! How do you do this with your kids? - One, two... - And three! Do you have anything to tell me? Sure, I have. - What then? - Well... Well, your friend Yvette... Yes, Yvette, did you find her? - Well. - Why didn't you say something? - It's just... - What did she say? She moved. - Really? - Yes. But she remembers you perfectly! It wasn't easy to find her. She does aqua-aerobics. She's in great shape. She was nice to me. Does she have a stick like me? - No. - No? Well, she's lucky! I'm happy for her. Is aqua-aerobics nice? Yes, I think it is. I told her you were sad to not be able to see her anymore. She's very sad too. "Life is short, you shouldn't let go of people you love." That's what she said. She said that? She's forgiven me then. Yes. Lighter. Beautiful flower for young woman! Are you kidding me? You call this clean? Those glasses are clean. Mind your own business and drink! Do you think this is clean? You'll see if this is clean. See? Get some work done. Do you think you're on welfare? Do you think I pay you to do nothing? Do you want another, Jean? With ice? Don't sulk! - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. Hey! Have you been working there long? - It'll be four years in June. - Four years? Your boss doesn't seem easy to work with. Why are you telling me this? No reason. Not bad, right? What about you? How are things with your Charles? It was... Better than with your husband? Come on! Don't be stuck-up! No, I'm not stuck-up. I've never been married. Husbands are a drag! And children are worse! You'll come see me one day. I'll introduce you to my kids, you'll change your mind. I'm sure I will. My boys are funny, they make me laugh so much. My daughter is a bit angry, but... She grew up too fast. And I was young, time just flew by. I would like her to study later. I got a degree. I wasn't bad, but I dropped out because I lacked confidence. - How much do I owe you? - Four euros. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - And where are you from? - A small village near Angers. Ah. I don't know Angers. - Is that OK? - Thank you. Paris is my dream. I've never been there. - Don't you have any savings? - No. Why? To be able to consider your options. Life isn't scripted, you know. You can decide to do something else. Otherwise, one day you might have regrets. You're young. You're beautiful. What's keeping you in that café? You don't owe the landlady a thing. - You shouldn't waste your youth. - Do you have a job for me? - No. - Then why say all this? Virginie. Don't take it the wrong way. This is Virginie. I invited her. Is that all right? Let's see. What's Simone de Beauvoir's first name? - Simone? - Good answer. - I like this kid. Come in. - Go ahead. Excuse me? Will you go? Those three... Yes? We need new beers. These are warm. - Warm? - Yes, warm. - Not chilled. - Not chilled? Are you just going to repeat everything I say? All right. We'd like to be served by the landlady. What a pain in the arse. What's wrong with my beer? Are you the one in charge? Can't you tell? What do you think you're up to? - Tell your friends... - You really are quite a bully. What's your problem, you old hag? Shut up! Shut up! But before you do, apologise. Apologise to the girl, or I'll have your place shut down. I'll call in the hygiene inspectors, health and safety! Then we'll see what happens. It's not very clean here, is it? In fact, it's disgusting. Get out of here, all three of you! I don't want to see you again! Life's good. Yes. - We get on well, don't we? - Yes, we do. Not quite what I had in mind. I must have mixed it wrong. It's a bit purple. Oh, well. I think I look younger. Marthe... I'm going to go home now. I thought you might. Will you forgive me? I'm so sorry. We were happy together. Yes. But... everything comes to an end, it seems. - Is that yours? - I'll admit it. Help me, won't you? - Want to go for a ride? - Do you have your licence? Yes. Why? What do you want to do? - Guess. - I don't know. No, I've no idea. Before you ditch me, we'll go visit my friend, Yvette. Yvette? But we can't go see her. We must call first. We can't just turn up. No, it'll be fine. It's better to surprise her. You'll see. Now's the time. I'm ready. Where the problem? You lied to me, didn't you? You don't have a licence. Never mind. I can drive. And the car been in here too long. Yvette's dead. She's... dead? Yvette? - Yvette Merle? - Yes. She died three years ago. I'm sorry I lied. I wanted you to think she'd forgiven you. - Be quiet. - And I'm sure she would have. I can't believe it. I'm really sorry, Marthe. I thought it was for the best. For the best? Do you enjoy thinking for others? You're all getting on my nerves! I'm so sorry. It was for the best. How would you know what's best? I'm tired of this! I'm tired. And I'm sick of being old. - What are you doing here? - I missed you. But how did you find me? I could have taken the train... Oh, right. With what money? And not all roads lead to Angers. I thought you were sick of me. What I don't want is to die alone, like a dog. Like Yvette, all alone. It's no Mercedes. Is anyone home? Is anyone home? Come along, Marthe. Follow me. Is anyone home? Looks like they've all gone out. - I like it here. - Do you? Good. You're here? Didn't you hear me come in? I did. - I'm glad to see you, big mouse. - I'm not a mouse. Did you remember that you had kids? Nice of you to think of us. I can see why you're upset, but... You needed to find yourself? Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie is perfect for that. But we get up in the morning and nobody is there. I'm bloody furious with you and you're not even aware of it. I hope you had a ball. Because we had a great time here. You chose a fantastic husband. I was afraid you'd never come back. It'll be fine. I'm OK. It'll be fine now. Have you grown taller? The make-up suits you. Come. I want you to meet someone. Come. No, he was with a client, so we didn't have time to speak. - Was he angry at you? - He was with a client, so... We weren't really able to talk. - Will you be OK? - Yes. It'll be fine. Do you want me to be there when he comes back? - No, it won't be necessary. - Are you sure? No. See you tomorrow at school? - We can have a coffee. - OK. OK. See you tomorrow. Stop. Stop. Serge. Serge, stop. You've found someone else, haven't you? No, further to the right. That's it. Perfect. You thought you could just come back? Who do you think you are? Look at yourself. Mum? Mum. Answer me, please, please. Don't just stand there. Call an ambulance! Wake up, Mum. - I'm here, Mum. - Hello? There... There's been an accident. - Mum, answer me, please. - My wife... fell. - Her head. Yes. - Open your eyes, please. Shit. What's going on? Get the ventilator. Ventilator on 19 revs per minute. I want you out of here by tomorrow. How did get all your friends to come? I promised them a party. - Really? Where? - At home, if you don't mind. - When? - Next Saturday. You're sure it's this way? - I said, sure it's this way? - Yes, it is. Really? How do you know? - I looked it up on the Internet. - Ah, in that case, no comment. - And if we can't comment... - Well, when one is in love. And all thanks to the magic postcard. The love note that says... What's all this about a stuck switch? - What if her husband's there? - We'll follow the plan. - We don't have a plan. - Exactly. - What are you doing? - We're coming along. No, I must go alone. What will we do, then? What did you do while I was in jail? Go to the visitors' room. You'll have to find some new activity, then. - But we want to know how it goes. - I'll tell you. Well, go on. - May I? - Sure. - I have some croissants. Want one? - Yes, please. Thank you. - Is your mother not home? - She went for a walk. She won't be long. - May I wait for her? - Sure. SUBTITLES: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
