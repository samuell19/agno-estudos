Last night, at the local bar, somebody said, and I won't say who, that a tie against Guastalla would be enough. What the fuck! Everybody listen carefully. I want the Borgorosso Football Club, this team which I raised from the shit of an amateur league, up to the threshold of being promoted, to enter, heads held high, in the upper category. We only have two matches, both from home, on the opponent's turf. We must win! At any cost, even at the cost of dying! Be careful and remember that the Guastalla boys are no fools! So, no nonsense! No stalling tactics! No bullshit! We shall win! Holy shit! - What is he doing? Are you crazy? - Why are you braking? Doctor! - Why did you stop? Passeretti, come here! What's the matter? - What is it, idiots? The president is ill! - The president? What is it? I told him to stay home this time! - My Lord! Descend on us and stay forever! Amen. Amen. May I come in? It's Benito. Oh, dear Benito. - May I, Monsignor? I was in the print shop. I think, the first sheet of the series, Priesthood, the color is too bright. If I may, I'd like to burn it, I wouldn't want it to fall into the wrong hands. Yes, burn it. Have a seat. It wasn't that I wanted to talk to you about. Do you remember Don Regazzoni? Ah, right, you left Romagna when he hadn't yet taken orders. 30 years ago, I left Borgorosso, in Romagna… - And your father? You haven't seen him for 30 years? - Not since '46, Monsignor. When I had scarlet fever, I remember vaguely due to a high fever, he came by briefly avoiding my mother. You know that my parents… Benito, the time has come to forget some misunderstandings. They're not misunderstandings, Sir, but concrete facts. The wrong my father did, I can't forget. - A little while ago, Don Regazzoni called to tell me your father had a heart attack. - It's not the first time. However, this could be his last one. And at this moment, your exact duty as a son and Christian, your place, is to be by his side. And… you must convince your mother to go with you, my son. I can forget the wrongs I suffered, but my mother won't! And I'm sure she won't step one foot into a house where she was so insulted and humiliated! If you don't hurry up, you idiot, that cow will snatch the sheets too! THE PRESIDENT OF THE BORGOROSSO FOOTBALL CLUB How much do I owe you? That's 4,900, Sir. - OK. Mama! 4,900. Thank you, Sir. Keep the change. Thanks. - Bye, dear. Goodbye, Sir. Damn your ancestors! They're even coming from the Vatican! Did you leave him the 100 lire? - Mama! It fell in the sewer! Must we pay? See? The monument of Baracca, the hero. - Yes, I know, Mama. I remember, it was in the school books. The countryside is flourishing, eh, Mama? - Yes, the fruit is wonderful. In fact, they throw it away. We've driven many miles, Mama, and we haven't seen even a dog. Really? Nobody? Not even one person. Where is everyone? - Who knows? Where are the people? You're right. - Is there an epidemic? We're here. This is Borgorosso. This town is deserted too. Where's everyone hiding? CAMILLO FORNACIARI Fervent Patriot - Enlightened Spirit Who was that, Mama? My revolutionary great-grandfather? Mama! Excuse me? May I? Hey, Riccardo! Dad's old studio. I didn't remember it being on the ground floor. Mama… Mama! Mama! There's nobody here. - Maybe they took him to the hospital. Or Don Regazzoni exaggerated. - God forbid he gets better. I don't remember the house being so big, beautiful, warm, welcoming. I hate this house! There's daddy, Mama. - Yes. What do we have here? A delicatessen? Disgusting. - You think so? Is anybody here? Excuse me! What a smell! Mama! What are you doing? - Here's your heart attacks! Look at that salami! - Aren't you ashamed? - Scipione? There's someone, Mama. - Scipione! Excuse me, Reverend… - Yes? Ah, Mrs Amelia! My dear, don't! Then you're Benito? - Yes. Don't you remember me? I'm Don Regazzoni! Benito! - Dear, Don Amleto. So nice to see you again! You look much like your dad, you know? Thank goodness, you came in time! - Where is he? He's upstairs but unfortunately, I'm afraid this isn't a good time. I wanted you, Benito, to make peace. Your father is a fine man. You came just in time. We told him to be calm. - Is it serious? Unfortunately, your father has the tired heart of passionate men! Scipione, how are we doing? - Bad, still 1 to 0. Darn it! - What? We're losing! Who are they? - Maybe the wife and son. To the right. Benito! Benito! Come. Of course, the house after so many years… If I may, I'll show you the way. Excuse me. This way. What's this? And why? I must be really sick if the crow is here. Don't move! Your place is here! Mrs Amelia, where are you going! - You saw her? That slut! - Yes, but this is not the time, please! You surprise me. What are you saying? I'm back after 30 years and still find her there! - What? But that's not Adalgisa. No, Adalgisa has been dead a long time, since Fiorentina won its first championship. That's Erminia, her niece. Excuse me a moment. Hello, who's this? Yes, Pasolini, go on. Darn it! …a magnificent play by Giorgetti! Giorgetti II is a loser! What is it? Nothing, what should there be? Don't be a Jesuit. What's going on? In Massa, Celerina tied. - No! Pasolini called me just now and the match ends soon. Damn it! - I know. If we don't tie, we're screwed! Goodbye, promotion! Erminia! - Yes? Tell the coach to switch Giorgetti II. Let Passalacqua in! Pierino? Get Giorgetti out and let Passalacqua in. You hear? - The President says to hurry. No, I won't switch out Giorgetti II. - If you won't, I will! But I'm the coach here, and I can't… - No, you're an animal! He's right! Come on Passalacqua, get up! Warm up! Attack, come on! As soon as he entered the field, Passalacqua threw himself… Excuse me, Ma'am? I'm the accountant Braglia. I take care of the administration. … a great heart, which beats in unison with its great President! Tell him to stop talking bullshit. Don't crowd the center! Spread out! They'll never pass like that! All right, President. Send the order to the coach. You're Benito? Yes. How pale you are. You're really ugly! Passalacqua! Goal! A goal! Passalacqua has scored! Bravo! - Bravo, President! - You were right, President! Long live the Borgorosso! - We did it! Bullshit! If Celerina ties, we'll be even! The decisive battle is still to be fought! Next Sunday will be the championship. I'll be at the bench, I'll show you! Damn it! Holy cow, how disgusting! Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? - What is it? The president… - What does he say? He'll no longer say anything. If you can understand, I absolve you from your sins. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Yes, on the sixth page and in the biggest possible bold characters. And in the obituaries, please. Excuse me, Ma'am, a quick phone call, and I'll be right with you. Be patient. The title: "The death of Libero Fornaciari Valle, President of Borgorosso Football Club." Yes. The text: "With Libero Fornaciari Valle, a great sportsman disappears," "an exemplary figure of Romagna football." "An enlightened and successful entrepreneur," "he had put all his energy and enthusiasm" "to empower the Borgorosso Football Club." "In the soul of all sportsmen," "beyond the great sense of emptiness for the passing of its president," "an anxious question is urged," "Who will take his place?" "Who will be the new president of the Black and White Zebras?" "And we ask ourselves too. Who will it be?" Me! I assure you, Accountant. I've never seen such a beautiful cellar. The barrels were your father's great passion. Together with the football team and together with… You understand me, Professor? - Perfectly. I know to whom you allude. In fact, by the way, tell me… - Yes? That woman, you know who I'm referring to? - You mean Erminia? Yes, Erminia. I think it'd be good to make her see that she's no longer welcome. - I'll talk to her. However, I don't know if it'll be easy to replace her. You see, these girls have had an exceptional performance, which allowed the relaunching of the company. Because while your father took care of the football team, Erminia was running the cellar. Here, Professor, this is her office. - Yes? Please. You see? I do see. It looks more like the office of a sports club than the office of a winery. How happy he was in that photo. It was when Borgorosso promoted. That's when the trouble started. At first, 10 million was enough. 10 million? - Too little? - Too much! Then look here. Your father spent 30 million to buy these 3 idiots. - Madness! Of course it is but try to tell that to the Borgorosso fans. Everyone is a fan here in town. Starting with Don Regazzoni, who, on Sunday, right after the mass, runs off to see the game. Do you know how much your father has lent out to Borgorosso? - No. 157 million. Come in. May I? Excuse me, I need to talk to the professor about something private. I'll wait outside, Professor. If you like, we could go to the Tredozio Farm before breakfast. What I have to say to the professor won't take too much time. Please, take a seat. - No. I prefer to stand. Listen, Professor, you know who I am. And I'm sure you know the nature of my relationship with your father. No. Actually… - I've been his woman for 20 years. And I loved him very much. But I've always known my place. I knew he had a wife and a son and one day, Erminia would need to go. It is the law of this country. But I'm not complaining. I was happy with your father and he with me. But if my presence annoys you, just say so. I'll leave right away. Dear Miss, you spoke to me frankly and sincerely. And I must be equally frank and sincere. It's true, a little while ago, I told Braglia to inform you that… …were not welcome here. But upon entering this office, I've changed my mind. Now it's me, Miss, who'll say, "I'd be happy if you stayed here at your post." OK, as long as you don't call me "Miss" anymore. OK, as you wish. Well? What are you doing, girls? Back to work! There are 24 hectares of land. On the hill facing south, all vineyards. We should renew the vines, your father talked about getting funds from the Green Fund with Bulgarelli. Bulgarelli? I remember the name. - Bulgarelli Deli. He became Mayor. He'd do anything to become the president of Borgorosso. Why? - Out of vanity, ambition, interest. But also for electoral reasons. Your dad could've become a member of parliament, if he wanted. Taste this wine. "It smells of sea and gorse", as your poor dad would say. Listen, speaking of dad, you assure me, Accountant, that Borgorosso will pay the 157 million? Absolutely. It has already paid it. You see, Borgorosso is, or rather was, owned by your father. Now it's yours. Therefore you are a creditor, to yourself, for 157 million. - Then it's a joke! Have a word with Bulgarelli, if he wants to buy the team, I'll accept. I can negotiate but what will the councilmen say? - Don't worry. Think about selling the team, I'll take care of the others. Accountant Braglia is an asshole! Let me tell you! What are they doing? - Training. Sunday's match will be decisive. - If we win, we go to Series B. Did my father built all this? - Everything. Every cubic centimeter of cement and every clod of grass. All his work. I imagined my dad very different. - Like what? Like different… What should I say? - Want to meet the players? No. Meet them? They're all sweaty. And what would I say? - Say hello. Look, Benito, tomorrow we have a game we'll surely win, moving to Series B and the team'll be worth double. So you'll hafta give them a prize. A prize? - 100,000 lire each. - No, wait! - Come over here, guys! Come on, guys! - Under the grandstand! We're coming! - It's 100,000 lire each! It's 100, 000 lire each, eh! - Thank you! - OK. You're welcome. Heavens, are you in mourning too? - I'm the goalie. - I'm glad. You're welcome. Go on now. I'm doing fine, you know, Mama. I would've never believed it. I didn't think the vineyards were so beautiful, you know? I know them. Did you fire that tramp yet? - No, Mama, not yet. I must be careful. I mustn't alienate the staff. I'll fire her, don't you worry. You must fire her. - Yes, Mama. At the right time, don't worry. Now, I must deal with the team. The mayor would do anything to become the president of Borgorosso. It's a mania! But I'll make him suffer! Mama, the amazing thing is that I'm becoming a shrewd business man. I'll be back in Rome soon. I'll marry Alicia and travel the world. You'll be paid for all the sacrifices and wrongs you've suffered. Why are you talking like that? - I've a candy in my mouth. Don't eat too much, eh? Be careful with the local food. It's fat and heavy. And with your liver… Sure, Mama, don't worry! Tonight, soup in broth, soft-boiled eggs, stewed plums. Thanks for the reminder, I'll tell her. Stewed plums! - What?- Pour it on. Bye, Son. Come back soon, very soon! - Don't worry, Mama. You phone Alicia. Tell her, I think of her often. Bye, kisses for everyone, Mama. A bottle of Sangiovese from '54. It's a delicacy. - Let me taste it. Blessed are those invited to the Lord's table. Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. Oh Lord, I am not worthy to attend Your Table, but just say the word and I'll be saved. Come up whoever wants communion. You move it! Move out of the way. - What is it? What's happening? Come on. Hurry! The Body of Christ. Please, Ma'am, go. Next. The Body… The Body of Christ. Go on. Next. The Body of Christ. Go away, Ma'am, please. Next! Hurry! Move it! I'm going, Don Amleto. See you at the stadium. - Go, my son! Excuse me, Reverend, may I say something? - Yes. You don't celebrate mass. You rush it. Of course, I rush. Don't you hear the people outside? You expect me to get there when the game has already started? Mass is more important than a match, no? - Sure, it is. You see, it can be long or short. I do the short. - Yes, quite short. You skip pages. When reading the Gospel of Matthew 10: 16-22, "I send you like sheep among wolves," you skipped, "Brother will kill brother." What, my son? You know all the saints and gospels by heart? - Yes, all of them! So, I'll be more careful next time. Come, Benito, let's go! "Children will rise up against their parents and will put them to death!" Death to the referee! I'm going on the field. If any player gets hurt… - OK, bye. Benito, these are our seats. Careful! - Where? I want to introduce you to Mr Ermanno, President of Celerina. Benito Fornaciari. - May the best win. And who's the best? - Celerina, of course! - What does he want? Cheer the president! Thanks! Thanks! - This applause is also for you. Come on! Go! Kill him! Kill him! Come on! Pass the ball! Watch out for out of bounds! They're terrific! What happened? - We scored! We did it! So sorry. - Go to hell! Change places. And take off those black glasses! I knew you'd bring me bad luck! Giuseppe, sit here. - You're wonderful! Are you a fan too? - Fuck you! That's not a kid but an animal! - Youthful enthusiasm. Borgorosso! Borgorosso! Borgorosso! Borgorosso! Go on! Attack! Did he get hurt? What did he do? Referee, fuck you! Out! Out! That'll be the first thing to bring us bad luck! Reverend, when a player gets hurt, what happens? Soon after, according to the rules, he can be replaced by another player. Come on! Courage! Come on! - Go! Borgorosso! Borgorosso! What is that fool doing? I haven't seen a goal like that for years! - What? A goal like that hasn't been seen for years! What? Are you fucking with me? Don't take it seriously. Sports enthusiasm! It's the outlet of animal instincts! Pass! - Shall we go, Reverend? Where are you going? Pass! We've already won. - Won? There's still the second half! The first half will end soon. Careful! Give away that ball! Those sheep deserve a good lecture! Let's go down to the locker room. - Shall we go? Where are you going? - What do you want? We'll fuck you up now! - Tell your mama that! They kicked your ass! Wretch! Scoundrel! Piece of shit! Ass! You shut up! You've lost your mind! Look what he did! - I don't want see anything! You gotta knock him down, you coward! Tired, eh? - What do you want? Think you won? You'll see, we'll kick your ass! - Don't you know any other words? Sweaty, eh? A tremendous effort! I'm curious, Referee, why do you run so fast? What do you mean? - I said… Wouldn't it more comfortable to sit on those high chairs, like in tennis? Is this your first football match? - Yes, the first and the last! Look, go sit down. Sit down. - Yes, I'll sit down. Keep the opponent under control. The great secret of football is here. Pierino! I found him. He was hiding in the Celerina locker room. Say a word to the boys. - Me? What should I say? Good luck, guys! What are you saying, you wretch? - Son, are you crazy? What should I say? In the wolf's mouth? No, we say, "In the whale's ass!" It's always the ass! - Come on guys, everyone out! Let's go! Come on! Move it! Let's go too. Behave yourself! Hey, easy! What are you doing? I lost my badge. Is this the way, you participate in a football match? Come on, don't incite the crowd! Go away! You don't know who I am! They were beasts, Mama. Indescribable! Simply beasts! A dreadful spectacle! Truly indecorous! I endured only the first half, then I left it all in disgust! Alicia's here. I'll put her through, eh? Yes? Hi, Benito. - Hi, Alicia dear. How are you? I'm fine. I'll be back soon, you know? I really miss all of you. Me too. What are you doing in that plain? My uncle, the Monsignor, asked about you yesterday. Dear Monsignor Montanari. Give him my dearest greetings. Of course. Benito, can I do something for you? Do you want me to join you? If you want, I could ask for special permission from the Red Cross. You say, "no"? I'd better not? - Benito! Don't eat too much. And don't drink, please. Did you fire that woman? - No, Mama, not yet. Now the most important thing is to fix the team, the Borgorosso Football Club. With today's victory, it went into a higher category. If Mayor Bulgarelli wants to become its President… …he'll have to give me more than twice what poor daddy spent! You only think about money. Are you really sure we won? In the first half we won 2-0, in the second, I bet they went wild. He's upstairs. They're coming, Mama! I've got to go. Kisses! I look forward to celebrating the victory! Here are my friends! Come, let us toast to victory! What are you doing there? Come up! How many goals did we score? - 2. Good! And the Celerina? - 3. Goo… does that mean we lost? - Yes. Damn your ancestors! So, let's get to the point. - I know you spoke to Accountant Braglia. Yes, he told me that you want to get rid of Borgorosso. - No. "Get rid of" are not the right words. I want to sell it to a person worthy of taking over from my father. I believe, modesty aside, I am. I hope nobody doubts it. Oh, heavens, no! So, I looked it over with Braglia. - Yes. I'm willing to accept the presidency of the Borgorosso Football Club. - Yes. Taking on all the responsibilities of the management of the company. - Good. Naturally, from the day of your dad's death onward. - Death? And the past? As to the past, we wipe the slate clean. - Clean? My father spent a fortune! Just the locker rooms, the stands, the central grandstand, were 50 million! And the team? Last year, for 3 players, Cocchia, Furlan, Bordon, know what he paid? 30 million! - 30? They ain't worth 30,000! - Who says so? I do. - My advisers say they are good. Professor, you're surrounded by incompetents, leeches exploiting you, like they exploited your father. I'm being honest. And to show that I care, I'll offer 10 million. - 10 million? That doesn't even cover the land cost. - The land belongs to the municipality. The municipality? - Sure. And there's a regular deed of gift for each work. - No! Yes! Yes! Yes! He's right! Bulgarelli must have thought me a fool! Did you know, that not even the land is ours? Your dad was fond of his field out of sentimentality and didn't pay attention… Didn't pay attention? My father may have been fond of his field but I'm not! And excuse me but these important details, you don't tell me? Who's that? You only said that we needed to finance the vineyards! - May I? Valentino Zuccotto, old friend and admirer of your father. You want to talk to Braglia? - No, I don't even want to look at him. I'm here to talk to you. - About what? Your poor father and I had made a plan to strengthen the team. Don't talk to me about football, I'm sick of it! - Tell me about it! I have been dealing with players for 20 years, therefore I know perfectly well these depressive states. Once the moment of anger for the defeat passes, the passion… - No! Football disgusts me! - But it's a safety valve. It's the opium of the people. You trade in opium? You know that's illegal, right? Football isn't on the drug list. - Let's hope it'll be there soon. However, look, I've no intention of buying! And selling? Sell how? You have players. Most of them suck. But if you authorize me, I could try to sell those 4 or 5 which don't suck as bad. Close the door, please. So I can sell players and you don't tell me? Accountant! Football disgusts me. - You're repeating me? Zuccotto, please. You're amazing, Benito! 32 million for 4 big boys! Incredible. - And that's nothing, Mama. Zuccotto, who's an expert and a friend, promised to sell one of the fullbacks. Benito, hurry back home. And did you fire that woman? No, Mama, not yet. She's not a bad woman. Very useful in the company. A good worker. She's a whore! - Mama! I've never heard you say such bad words! - She's a whore! Whore! Whore! Whore! He doesn't care! He just wants to make money! Impossible! - Pierino already called the paper. You'll read it tomorrow. What are you talking about? - Benito sold Bondavalli, Ceron, Benussi and Galli! He's crazy! - He's a scoundrel! - No, he's a saboteur! He ruined the team! - We can stop it! We can't do anything! He has the power to do it! The team's his and he'll do what he wants! - The fault's Bulgarelli and his money. Braglia told me. - Bulgarelli's a sack of shit! What did you expect from that pig killer? - Let's set up a limited company. This way, we can buy the players back. - Don't fool yourself! For Borgorosso it's over! It'll take 5 years to recover! - No, don't give up. That Jesuit must pay! Have you heard? The president sold the strongest players! -The fool! He goes against his interests! - Without those players, the team's over! Madness! - They phoned me now from the paper. The news is right! Everybody listen! Friends! Friends! Fellow citizens! The National League's medical commission found in the Celerina players' urine traces of amphetamines, and by virtue of Article 8 has decreed that the Celerina Football Club has been penalized 10 points! Great! Meanwhile, the Borgorosso moves to the top of the ranks and enters the upper division by right! Great! Amazing! - I'll go tell the Mayor! Mayor Sir! Mayor Sir! - What is it? Celerina was disqualified and the Borgorosso promoted. I could slap myself! I could've had the Borgorosso for breadcrumbs! I could slap myself! - Slap yourself, eh? Libero Fornaciari's dream has come true! Idiots! The best players are gone! - Yeah, right! And now we got a really good team! - Damn that Roman! I told you we should've kicked him out! I'm really satisfied, Accountant, to have resolved everything so well and quickly. There's the traitor! The Roman! And who are these? - Maybe some rally. No, they are mad at us. - Us? Yes. What do you want? I don't understand what they mean. They're insulting you, Professor. -They're using curses! What do they want? They take advantage because I'm in here! Tell them to get mad at Mayor Bulgarelli! Hey! Why don't you explain it to them, Accountant? - Yes. Shame on you! Stop! - Calm down, guys! Oh, my goodness, they're enraged. Think of something. - Me? I'm getting out. Talk to them. Excuse me! Sirs, excuse me! - Worm! Excuse me!Gentlemen! - Go home! Stop that! Stop! Go home! - Shut the door! Hurry! Stand back! - Hurry! Come in! Hurry! Hurry, lock the door! Don't let them in! Where's the phone? I gotta ask for help! - Near the window! Reverend, have you seen the President? - No. Let's go look for him! Hello, Fornaciari Valle's residence. - Your father's house will be your grave! Where is he? - You're asking me? You're supposed to protect him! - If they catch him, they'll lynch him! He disappeared! - Disappeared? Search for him! You'll return to Rome in a hearse! You damned, ungrateful worm! I order you to cease talking! This is the Marshal! Guys, come with me! Let's move from behind! Come! Let's pass through here! Hello? Hello! He's not even in the cellar! - Maybe upstairs. Look for him upstairs then! Leave the line open! That's an order! He's not upstairs. - I looked under the bed. Where could he be? Benito, where are you going? Erminia, go after him! Hurry, come on! Close the door! - Stop! Stop! Professor, come out! I know you're here! I saw you going up! Professor! Come on! Let's throw stones! Stop! Stop, in the name of the Law! Stop! Are you crazy? Stop! Maybe he's in the closet. Here he is, Ma'am! Professor! What are you doing in there? - What am I doing? You put me here! I know nothing! What do those men want? You're a disgrace! Did you want to start a civil war? I don't want anything! You're all nuts! What do I have to do with it? You sold the players! - Sure! They were mine! I inherited them from dad! For the last time: get back or I'll shoot! Get back! Get back! Fools! All this because of 4 players? - They'll kill us all! Kill us? Oh, God! You're afraid, eh? You really deserve to be beaten from head to toe! Not because of those 4 players you sold! - No? But because you're a wimp! The fault's mine: I shouldn't have let you grow up with those damn priests! Dad, what should I do? - Remember the name you carry. Get out on the balcony! The crowd is female! She loves to get fucked! Men and women of Borgorosso! Generous and faithful! Listen to me! Listen to me! I speak on behalf of my father! A group of traitors, hidden in the shadows, wants to take over the glorious team, which belonged to my great, illustrious, unforgettable father! Now, don't overdo it, Benito! Sowing the seeds of malice and provoking your fierce but legitimate reaction! I'm accused of having given up the strongest on the team! Well… … at this point, allow me to laugh! The strongest? They were donkeys! Useless players! Who showed their cowardice on the field! What then, do you accuse me of? I've only tried to interpret your aspirations, which were also those of my great father! Prepare yourselves, fans for a new Borgorosso: powerful, invincible! That's the point! Why did I sell them? Because I wanted to buy! I want to replace everything: coaches and players. All! I want the players of Borgorosso to become a team of authentic champions! It's like the old man talking! - That's what I did. If I'm wrong, I'm here! Punish me. But if you agree, answer with a "yes!" Yes! Can I count on your cooperation? - Yes! On your trust? - Yes! Men and women of Borgorosso, on your self-sacrifice? - Yes! On your enthusiasm? - Yes! And then my heart and yours will have to beat hard in unison! For the greatness and the ever higher goals of our Borgorosso Football Club! - Erminia! White! Black! Borgorosso! - Rosso! Rosso! Rosso! White! Black! Borgorosso! - Rosso! Rosso! Football Club! Rosso! Rosso! Football Club! Who? - Football Club! Football Club! We'll see you tomorrow for the Alpine stage, which Italian fans have longed for. That's all for cycling. - Thanks, dear. Let's get to football. As you know, the market is in full swing. We're about to connect with Milan, in particular with the Gallia Hotel, the traditional venue for acquiring players. Here the presidents who come and go are the real protagonists. Their handshake can sometimes be like a real contract. Here you see a group of fans, eagerly awaiting news. Here at times, the fate of a championship is decided. Did you have a good trip, President? - You know everyone, right? - Good day! Would this be the fabulous Hotel Gallia? Have you talked about our Borgorosso? - Zuccotto doesn't talk, he acts! Maybe we'll score big together. - Good, let's! I can't say much about players, but the coach… There's the TV! Wait! Look, another idiot who waves at cameras. Why wave? At whom? Please turn off the TV before sitting down. I can't listen to football anymore. Mama! I wanted to see the Armed Forces! - No, turn it off, please. The business volume will exceed the limit of 15 billion… Mama! That's Benito! - Benito? I knew it. He's at the Gallia hotel, buying players. - Buying? Selling! If you keep going back and forth… - I'm the president of Borgorosso Football Club! I don't care! Go inside and get lost! - Hi, Mama! Then, under the photograph, put this caption… yes. "Professor Benito Fornaciari," in parentheses, "the new and dynamic president of the Black and White Zebras" "doesn't mind expenses…" yes. "to secure the collaboration of a famous coach." "Borgorosso scores big!" "The new coach is the famous Italian-Peruvian, José Buonservizi." "The Borgorosso Football Club will be able to aim towards ever brighter goals." This time no one will stop us! Excuse me, Buonservizi. - Call him "Mister." - Yes? But he's South American. - No matter. Call him that. Mister, can we be sure of the acquisitions? - Sure, leave it to me. Don't worry. When will I see the players? - August 15th. They're all at sea now. I'm going to the sea too. Who told this wizard? You might wonder why I accepted to coach a modest team like Borgorosso. Yeah. How come? - How come? I wanted a revolution! A revolution? - Don't worry, we South Americans love revolutions. And you want a revolution in Italy? - A football revolution! Thank God. - Yes, from a football point of view. See those guys? It's Moschino, Santarini, Bet, Ghezzi and the great Omar Sivori! What are the players doing here? - They come here on vacation, every year. Excuse me, Mister, but you know Omar Sivori? - Sure! Would you introduce me? - Of course. - Yes? Omar! Omar, come here! - What a phenomenon he is, Mister! Meet the president of Borgorosso. I'm very honored to meet you. - A pleasure. - Truly very happy! As president of a small provincial team, I'm not used to meeting football stars. Don't mention it. - Tell me something, Omar, Why do the refs always disqualify you? I think it's due to the liveliness of the Neapolitans. For example, they always called him a cuckold and he always took it out on me. Good one! - Who is that guy? Who? - Him. The great Coach Buonservizi. Coach of what? - Football. - Football? - Yes. I don't know him. How dare he call me? - Sorry. I bet he said he didn't know me. - Yes, he said he didn't know you. See: a boy who came up from nothing, now disowns me. No! Don't take it personally, Mister! August: It's starting! The call for football. The championship, as you know, begins its long vigil in these days. The season for retreats begins, that habit of collective training, to which no society, neither small nor large, can no longer do without. Bienvenida, President! - Hasta la vista, Mister. Here they are! Los muchachos. Antonio. - Bravo! Francisco. - Bravo! - Giuseppe. - Our new acquisition! Good! Carmelo. - Bravo! - Luis. - Excuse me, Mister. You told me "young, strong, brave." Isn't this one a bit too old? I said young for football. These have children and no money. They have the determination of the hungry. Players are like bullfighters. With money, they're afraid of the bull, clear? - Very clear! Luciano. - Bravo! - Vincenzo. - Good! Siçito. - A pleasure! - Giovanni. - Bravo! Nicola. - Hello! - Mario. - Our other acquisition! Sergio. - Good! And our masseur, Trinca! - Great! - That's all of us. Only Guardavaccaro is missing. - Celestino Maria? - Yes. A player not punctual? I don't like it! - How dare he? Mister! Mister! - Who's that? I stopped to eat in Ferrara. My wife was hungry. - You got married without telling me? I got married this morning. You get married before the championship? You've shocked my good faith! Did you know? - You've shocked my good faith! Leave this to me. Celestino, you give me a great pain. I promise, I won't do it again. - I don't believe it! A promise of honor. - Listen. Come, Mister. Excuse me. Tell me, Mister, who the heck is he? Celestino Maria. What? - I know, but is he a player? There are 4 players. Can't you see? - Even 5 but he has glasses. - So? When he plays he wears contact lenses, like Stiles on the English National team. I see but isn't he too big to play? - He's huge. In fact, he doesn't play. He doesn't? - No. But with training, in a year I'll make him lose 40 kilos. I promise he'll be a champion! - You keep your promises, Mister? I do. - Muchas gracias! Hablas espanol? - Hablo espanol? Un poquito, Mister. Bueno, bueno. - Excuse me, Mister. Qui eres? - I'm Guardavaccaro's wife. Celestino didn't tell me he was leaving right away. And you're staying. - What do you mean? All players will retreat for two weeks. You'll stay with the other players' wives. Eat, drink, sleep. All paid by our president. Todo! Non estas contenta? - No! - No? No, no! - Non estas contenta? How spoiled this lady is! Every player, at the beginning of marriage, is half as good. Then she must be kept away from that calf. Mister, we're ready! - Coming! Coming! Will you excuse me, President Sir? - Please. Do you know how he calls the players? - How? By first name, like the Brazilians. Being president with that wizard will be child's play! Vamos, friends! Come on! Vamos! The Black and White of Borgorosso! With me! The road is unlikely to be ready by the end of the year. - Who's that? Mayor Sir, the Zebras of Borgorosso greet you! He's aged 10 years. - He wanted to be president. Now he's eating his heart out! How are you, Ma'am? - Fine, thanks. - Give it to me. I've asked you to come for something very important. Does it concern Benito? - Yes. I'll explain everything in the car, Ma'am. Come this way, please. The total purchase of the new players amounts to 64 million. He says they're just promissory notes. 64 million? - Furthermore, the coach has demanded 38 million in advance and a 3-year contract. The financial situation is beginning to suffer. I knew nothing about it. - Yes. On the phone, he always said that everything was fine. Was I right to ask you to come? - Yes, you were. Only you, kind lady, can restrain your son's madness. The team has retreated here in Tredozio. Luckily, the players are on a diet or they would've emptied the pantry in 2 days. Here, now you will understand. That is the new bus he bought to transport the team. And this is president's new car. 7 million and 318 thousand lire. Painted with the team's colors. - 7 million? And 318 thousand lire. - My God! What happened to the Mercedes? What did they do, Ma'am? It was destroyed by the public fury. The president didn't mind. He said it was better suited for a priest than for a president of a football club. I should've never left my son alone at the mercy of these madmen! Where is he? Tudina, where are you? - Who is it? Mrs Tudina! - What is it? Where is the president? - He's at the training ground, there! Over there. Is this the system, you would like to adopt, Mister? A physical exercise, adapted for football players. - Ah! Bueno! Mama! Mama! What a nice surprise, Mama! Why didn't you tell me? - My son, what are you wearing? A training suit, mama! Thank you, Accountant, for bringing her! - Guys, lunch is ready! Come here, Mama. Next to me. Attention, boys! We thank the Lord for the food which you have given us today. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Sit. - Thanks. What has our Tudina cooked for us today? Tortellini. - Tortellini! By the way, mama… Look. This is a diet that Mister imposed on the team. It's a table based on carbohydrates, from 60 to 40 daily points. It has been scientifically studied by NASA for astronauts. Why, are they going to the moon? The moon? He's sending us straight to the cemetery! Mama, tortellini are worth 25 points. Therefore the players can only eat with their eyes! Right, Mister? - Sure! Estos para nosotros. They don't exist! Well, maybe you'll laugh but among these guys, I (sorry, Mama), for the first time, I feel at home. I don't know if I'm clear, Father. Better than you think, dear. Your poor dad often said looking at his boys, "This is my family!" Monsignor Montanari said to me, "When will our Benito return?" Mama, I wrote Monsignor Montanari. I explained all the features of my business and how seriously I take them. I resigned, Mama. - Resigned? I hope he understands and accepts it. - You want to bury yourself in Borgorosso? No, Mama, I was buried in the Vatican. I am reborn to a new life. Can't you see how I look now? I used to be all white! Celestino, don't get desperate and don't look at other people's dishes! Have you finished eating your grass? Go train! Jump! Anda! Anda! - I'm hungry! No complaints! Mama! Look! See that big 130-kilo baby? He's Guardavaccaro. I paid 22 million for him. - 22 million? So? Celerina offered 30 for him. I wouldn't give him to them for 100! Mister promised me he would lose 40 kilos and become a formidable attack panzer! More than Nordahl! You know, Mama, football, if well managed, is an exceptional investment. You can earn 100%. Hombres! Boys! Lunch is over! Work starts! Anda! Anda! Y arriba el corazon! How lucky I am to have a coach like that! They call him a wizard! Anda! Anda! Mrs. Tudina, I smell roast, may I? Muchas gracias. Come! He has his shrine up here. Mister has received from Europe, and also from South America, all publications on football. He spends his nights studying. And now friends, I've a surprise for you. Et voilà! It comes from England, just imagine! Excuse me! Here, now I'll show you how it works. It is a modern means of planning home games. Let's take 3 pins, which are 3 players, our Borgorosso strikers. Good. We will call them A, B and C. A passes to B, who moves rapidly to position B1. C instead advances to position C1. Here is the ideal position to shoot a goal, but instead he stalls! Then he passes the ball to B, who moves from position B1 to position B2, running from his opponents, runs, shoots, kicks, goal! Isn't it terrific? - All right. And the opponents? - What opponents? They must take it. Would you go with me to the station? There's a train at 6:45. - Are you leaving? And the president? - The president, as you call him, pays me no heed. I'll know whom to contact in Rome. You'll hear from me in this garbage town! … and everything happens automatically. And the automatism is obtained with these exercises.You want to see? Come. Come. You see? They help coordinate muscular reflexes with the psyche. See? I want it because I see it. Sacrifice, effort, commitment: this is the footballer's life, Don't worry, relax your nerves. Close your fist, think of summer, winter is coming! - Mister! Shhh! They're meditating. One, two, three. Tranquility. Come in. May I help you, Ma'am? - Monsignor Montanari. Mrs Fornaciari Valle and her niece. - Have a seat. Monsignor, at this moment, has a very important meeting. He'll just be 10 minutes. Exactly 12. Excuse me. Alicia, you must be direct with the Monsignor. Yes, Mama. I will say, "Uncle", "after 20 years of betrothal, Benito must decide. Either his team or me." "Else, I'll break up with up and go to Africa." - Very good. Quiet! Think about playing. I'll take care of the arbitration. You locked him in, you two! Second penalty. Go! - Is that Monsignor? Your uncle, too! Mama, I think I'll go to Africa! You shouldn't have let let my mother leave. Accountant! Excuse me President, you know your mother better than me. And I don't think there's anyone capable of making her change her mind. No, if my father couldn't succeed. - With all due respect, he was a man… I know, Accountant, there's no need for me to repeat it. Poor mama. She'll think I'm crazy but she'll come around. Will you open the door, Scipione? It must be Pierino Ribaldi. - He always shows up before dinner. You should sign these bills, President. - What are they for? For the renewal of those 18 million discounted at the Agricultural Credit. Let's hope they'll grant the renewal. - Of course they will, otherwise you'll remove the deposit and put it into another bank, no? It's Mrs Guardavaccaro. What does she want? - To see you. Have her sit in the study. We were saying? - Transferring deposits in another bank. Exactly. - The deposits at the Agrarian Bank have been sold out for a long time. There are so many other banks. Aren't there?- These are difficult times. Banks no longer grant loans. - Accountant, you take care of it. I don't understand administrative matters. Else why are you here? - I'll try to do my best. Shall I go? Yes. - Goodbye. Good evening, President Sir. - Evening. What a nice surprise. Can I help you with anything? Want to sit down? A cigarette? - No, thanks. Sorry for bothering you but I can't take it anymore. Celestino told me to turn to you, since you're so kind. When did you see him? - I didn't. I went to Tredozio but Buonservizi threw me out. Not even a look from afar. Good! Buonservizi has done his duty. Do you understand the damage you could cause to your husband bothering him during preparation? - Bothering? - Yes! He's my husband, isn't he? - So? Before marrying you, your husband married Borgorosso, you know? Then he's a bigamist. - You're joking, aren't you? Absolutely not. Rather, if my husband won't act like one, I'll report him for deserting our bed! And I'll report you too, for kidnapping! Your husband signed a regular contract! - The contract states only he must play and not that he can't… You understand me, right? - Sure, Ma'am. I see your situation. You've been married for a few days. - 11 days. Well then, Ma'am… pretend not to be married and pretend you're still engaged. - I wish. Before we got married, we used to make love. Now we don't do it anymore. Everyday? - Ah! Even more. Well, take a rest, Ma'am. You're not alone in this situation. Think of the other players' wives. I don't care! I'm 19, you know? - Damn! 19? - What did you do at 19? I had typhus fever. - Please, President Sir, help me! Help me. - What can I do? Give Celestino 2 days leave. - No! Never! On Celestino, Borgorosso places all its hopes. This guy can become a champion, it also depends on his sacrifice! No, Ma'am! What are you doing? Come on! No Ma'am, don't do this! Help! How heavy you are! Cleopatra! Scipione! Come on, be good. Why are you acting so? Wake up! Be strong! Snap out of it! Ma'am, don't act so! What's wrong? How do you feel? - Breathe… I can't breath… I can't breath. - You can't breath, Mrs Guardavaccaro? Air… - Air? Air… - Air? Yes, Mrs Guardavaccaro. President, what are you doing? She felt sick, you see. I was using mouth to mouth respiration. I learned it on TV. - More. More air, dear? Mouth to mouth respiration. The things you can learn on TV! Let's go, dummy! Borgorosso - Passatore, 2 points. Vis Pascoli - Borgorosso, tie. Borgorosso - Excelsior, easy victory, 2 points. Of course. Saline - Borgorosso, as well, 2 points. Borgorosso - Brighella, 2 points. Trebbiano - Borgorosso, tie. Porque? We'll win. We'll win. The Trebbiano is weak on the left. We shall win for sure. 2 points. - Do I put 2 points? OK - With Trebbiano, we must win! Borgorosso - Garbino, 2 points. San Luca - Borgorosso, 2 points. - No, no, no! That is not safe. San Luca is strong in home games. It's not safe. - Assign 1 point? 1 point. - 1 point. A single point? Borgorosso - Cavese, 2 points. If we don't win, we're suckers! Total: 51 points! Viva! We will win! Promotion awaits us and we will conquer it! Borgorosso! Rosso! Rosso! Rosso! Black! White! Rosso! Rosso! Rosso! Black and Whites, Admiral Nelson, before the battle of Trafalgar, said to his men, "England expects each of you to do your duty." Thus, I say to you, "All Borgorosso expects each of you to do your duty!" Let's go. Muchachos, let's go! He who doesn't fight with rage, doesn't deserve to get a wage! He who doesn't join the fray, does his squadron betray! He who does his teammates ditch is one big son of a bitch! Vamos, muchachos! Good day. President of Albana. - May the best team win! And who's that? - Borgorosso! Let's hope they win. They're too quick to attack! Jerks! Borgorosso! Rosso! Rosso! Black! White! Rosso! Rosso! They lose the ball too easily! An injury of the defense. No biggie. The defense? - The defense doesn't worry me. Keep watching and you'll see! - Yeah, yeah… Now they'll attack. It's difficult to play against a team that doesn't know the rules of football! Sorry, President Sir, we're just a team of poor guys. This is what prevents Italian football from progressing! They're passing wrong! - They are. But matches aren't won midfield. But this is a massacre! We don't know the rules of football well. I'm so sorry! I can't stand this guy. There's a limit to everything, right? You see what is happening? - With such a defense… Don't talk during the game. Blundering Borgorosso. Albana wins 3-0. Excuse me, Mister, but from what I understand, you predicted we would lose? I did, President. I'm not worried about the result. Excuse me, Mister, if I interrupt you but many have noticed one thing. That while we were worn out, in the end, they were as fresh as a rose. - I confirm it! Sangiovese is already over-trained, while my theory is that players need to get in shape little by little. You're a doctor, you should already know this. Don't you know that if players make too much effort early on, then they suffer? Right? - Exactly! - Good grief! Exercise that lasts an hour and a half and only once a week! The most dangerous thing is to take the lead at the start. You then become the team to beat and thus create a fearful tension. This not only wears out the muscles but also the nerves. But then Mister, if I understand correctly, we must be the dog, not the hare? Exactly! Because the hare ends up in a dish! Eh, but you must get the hare first, to put it in a dish! Excuse me, Mister, but tell me, shouldn't Guardavaccaro play in the second half? - What? No, I meant… - No! No! The muchacho is not ready yet. And then we mustn't reveal our weapons too soon. Guardavaccaro is our trump card! He'll beat 'em down! In the hands of Passatore, Borgorosso is defeated with a firm 2-0 If it weren't for the pole, it would've been a magnificent goal. - Sure. But they always take the poles. - Too exacting! I honor my promises. Borgorosso will win next! No doubt! The defense moved muy bien! We only lost due to one goal. It was bad luck! - Dear Mister, I respect you, but look at these papers. They don't understand football! They made one mistake, unfortunately. And we lost the game. Defeated on its own turf, a humiliating 3-0 If they didn't take the pole, we would've scored! What matters is teamwork. - When does the comeback start? I said we'll be champions and I honor my promises. My team needs a heavier turf. With that, they'll be invincible. We trust you, Mister. - Winning's my middle name! Shipwreck in the rain: Borgorosso, a new defeat 2-0 It wasn't rain but a flood. It seemed to me that our players were slipping. When they ran, they even struggled to stay upright. - No! Could it be their diet, Mister? - No. The diet will make them light. They'll fly like butterflies. We just need some time. A teeny bit! "Defeated at home by Excelsior and Borgorosso is last in the championship." "The situation is no longer critical, it is decidedly tragic." "The fans are in turmoil." "What is he waiting for, the Black and White fans are asking," "to take those measures that any manager would, as they are not only…" "… necessary, but not to be postponed." Right? What are you doing? You agree? You too? Very good! President! - Well? What are you doing? Are you mad at me too? I did what you wanted, didn't I? You wanted the players, I bought them. You wanted a wizard! 100 million, he cost me. Damn him! Is it my fault if the team keeps losing? Who do I have to thank? Borgorosso's friends! Benito, listen. Can I tell you something? Your father, when the team lost, would ask himself, "What did I do wrong?" And he would find the answer and the solution. He was a great president, your father. He would've deserved an Inter, a Milan, a Juventus. - A Roma. No one deserves Roma. Look Erminia, do me a favor. Sit down. Help me. Tell me what to do. Because I thought I knew football. Instead, I don't know a damn thing! - The less we know, the better It's not about understanding football but men! But what are the players? They're kids! It's useless to give them speeches. They need an iron fist. Injections of enthusiasm. And trust! Your father knew that he could galvanize them before the game. And he kept them locked up at Tredozio, like chickens in a coop. And if they complained, he said, "If you feel like fucking, fuck the ball!" And he was right. Because I don't know if you feel the same but when the ball enters the net, one feels, inside oneself… Well… You understand me. Do as your father did. Don't listen to anyone. Take the reins in your hand and don't spare the whip! You hear me? You know what to do? Oh, Lord, our President is coming! Our patron who treats us with such generosity! You guys, be happy, please. President, what a surprise! - Yes? I don't think it's so nice. Guys, there's a bus waiting outside. I give you 5 minutes to get ready and come with me. Where are they going? - To the coop! - Non comprendo. Wizard, whether you do or not, I don't care! You will remain here ladies, at my expense. Let's go guys! You're the President but you can't offend me! - I won't even answer you! My embassy… - You're from Naples! What embassy? - At my consulate… I gave you 5 minutes! 3 have already passed! Go! Nobody move! Guys, I know Fornaciari, if he gets angry, watch out! Let's go! What are they doing? - Going to the retreat? It's us who'll lose out. To see Celestino, I'll have to wait until Monday. We'll stay here, in seclusion? - Let's hope it lasts only a few days. If they lose, prepare a widow's weeds. - Damn football! You can't treat me like this! I've a regular contract! I want my money! Damn you! You'll have to pay me to the last cent! Where are you going? My money! They're burning everything! Look, Mayor Sir. - What is he doing? He's leading them. - And what are the players doing? They chop wood, cut the grass, pile the hay. He's ruining them! He treats them as if they were peasants. Well, they're not lawyers. Come on, this is no time to be joking around. They're athletes, Mister built every day, both physically and psychologically. The President isn't entirely wrong. That's what they do in Germany. If the idea wasn't his, the method wouldn't be that bad. If all Italian football adopted this system, there'd be more goals! And agriculture would increase! - Yes, joke around. They no longer follow any diet. The farmer's son told me yesterday. They eat like wolves! Yes. Tagliatelle, cappelletti, agnolotti, lasagne. Ravioli! - All carbohydrates, 200/300 points a day, a disaster. Do you know, Mayor Sir, he didn't let me check the players. He kicked me out. - You know what else? Yesterday, I called and said I could come and give the boys mass on Sunday. You know what he said? "Don't worry, Reverend. There's another priest here, he'll do just fine." "He says mass even better than you!" The team must be got from him before he ruins it. It would be better for you, Mayor. So next year, you can get Borgorosso for chicken feed. Right, I should take a broken team with devalued players? You should hurry to get the team out of the hands of that madman! Let him cook in his own broth. At most, after 2 or 3 Sundays, he'll be kicked out. You're right! Come on, Ciccio. Don't get excited. Sit down. Why don't they defend the goal? This is not the right tactic! Damn! What do you want? - Shall I undress? What are you saying? Guardavaccaro, don't break my balls! Sit still! Hush! Come on come on! Borgorosso boys, come on! Press the opponent! Power! Violence! Stronger! Don't stand there like statues! Why don't you go in like men? Attack them, damn it! - Sit down! Immediately! The presidents are never seen at the bench! Go! He's being warned by the referee! Calm down or I'll send you out! This is no football game but a bullfight! A bullfight! Please! Fine, I get it. And they cry if you call them a cuckold! The ball is yours. Come on! Leave it! Don't fall in love with the ball! Pass it down! What are they waiting for? Why don't they break out? You had to pass it to the center! Come on undress, I'll let you in. Go! Go! Goal! Goal! What are you doing, asshole? Sit down! There! Here are some good tactics! Did you see that stuff? - Crazy! He has never scored in his life! You see, when you play like that, even the worst can score. Come on, pass the ball! Come on, action! Rush forward! Come on, don't get glued to the ball! Pass it! Goal! - Goal! Goal! Phenomenal! I can't watch this bad spectacle anymore! The League will get me my money! Of course, for a man like that, to see such a game must be just heartbreaking. Meanwhile we're winning. - What are you saying? Are you joking? With a team like that, even children could beat them! - Be quiet! Come on, Borgorosso boys! Get on them! Break their legs! They understand! The plan is working! Go on the attack! Come on! Come on! Goal! Goal! Then I don't go in? - No! Smile! Asshole, don't look like that! Come on! And from now on, for every victory, the prize will be doubled! Don't thank me. It is I who thank you. Goodnight, boys. Sleep well. Stretch out your nerves. Relax. And if you feel like fucking, fuck the ball. Dream. Dream of only hating your opponent. He who does his teammates ditch? - Is one big son of a bitch! Goodnight. Zanon, go! Your wife is waiting! - Going! My dear! - Hi, sweetheart! Hi, dear! Oh, God! The cow! Who goes there? Mamma mia! The President! Run! Go away, cow! Who's there? - It's me, President. I'm Mrs Zanon. Nice, Mrs Zanon! - I had to talk to my husband. You could've called him, no? You know, one can't say certain things on the phone. And above all, one can't do certain things, right? President Sir, I speak also on behalf of the other wives, we're entitled to celebrate the victory too. Ma'am… The players, at this hour, must sleep in the arms of Morpheus. And not in those of their wives. And in the arms of their wives? - A teddy bear. You think I'm cynical, right, Ma'am? No. I'm the President and as such I must impose an iron discipline on the team, for the glory of the players, your husbands. But as a man, I'm ready for any sacrifice. For the peace of the wives. Mrs Guardavaccaro told me that you're very nice and friendly. Did she say only that? Finally, a victory! Long live Borgorosso! Borgorosso! - Rosso! Rosso! Rosso! Listen to them cheering! Idiots! A bit put out because they won without your wizard? If we were true sportsmen, we would be ashamed of a victory like today's! - Why? Let's hear Gianni Brera. - First of all, I'm not Gianni Brera. I'm a sportsman and an honest reporter. And I say that we should be crying over the fate of our team, abandoned in the hands of an incompetent maniac! BORGOROSS SNATCHES THE TIE FORM GARBINO Yes! He's so lucky! I've never seen the like! How much did you get? - 87 million. Good. UNEXPECTED AND UNLUCKY VICTORY FOR BORGOROSSO 30 million at 4 months date. Thank you very much. - No worries. Say hello to your father. - I will. The Tredozio Farmhouse: 17 million. The mortgage on the cellar walls and the 2 floors of the house: 21 million and a half. - Good, Accountant! You fill out the documents, Training's at 2:00. I'll see you tonight. - OK, Professor. You know it too, no? He'll end up in a hospice. Mister, I'd like to know one thing: Should all these successes be attributed to luck or not? Sure! After a period of bad luck, when I was there, the good luck came! Of course! - But he takes credit for the victories? And he steals them from me. But I'll take all the dinero! Enter. This is the notice to appear. But the professor isn't here now. - I'll leave it with you. Name? - Accountant Quintino Braglia. As soon as he returns, I'll let him know. He has 48 hours. Goodbye. You only have 5 minutes to tie! Under attack! Cowards! 3 wins and 2 ties! We can win this round! I wonder how experts, as you claim to be, can praise a few off the cuff successes! It might be so but 8 points in 5 games is significant. In 5 games, I've scored 6 goals! - You have? What are you? Bulgarian? 8. Not 6! It's 6: one was an own goal, the other a penalty. Wasn't the penalty given by the referee? If we want to be sportsmen, we must recognize that ties and victories are due to a series of favorable circumstances that are difficult to repeat. Who cares? The important thing is winning! No, dear Salsiccia, you're exaggerating. With the tactics devised by that madman, no player knows his role anymore. - It's a modern game. Don't talk crap! We'll see who's right against Sangiovese! - We will, unfortunately. Sunday night, you'll cry bitter tears. - Whatever! The truth is that the president treated you like dirt. You and your fool of a wizard! Here we are, Ma'am. My boys. - Hello, everyone. Give me your foot. - Give her your foot. Give me your foot. - Give her your foot. Give me your hand. - Your hand. Give me your foot. - Your foot. Give me your head. - Give her your head. Let's go. Enter inside. "Squeeze a lemon, cut a chicken…" Close the door well, or the snakes will get out. "Evil-eye, over me pass. Tarantula, protect my ass." "Evil-eye, over me pass. Tarantula, protect my ass." Do you want to hear the latest what that fool is doing? Give me a drink. Now, his father, an atheist from head to toe and due to a heart attack couldn't eat meat, so he only ate steak twice a year: once on Good Friday and another time on the Ascension. I say, his father, before the match with Sangiovese, always brought the team to the Madonna of Pratobello. And we've always won. Right? His son… …raised inside the Vatican, do you want to know where he brought his team? - To the Sanctuary of Monticino? To the nuns of Poggio? To the Cappuchin friars? The gypsies! In the ditch of death to make spells! Borgorosso-Sangiovese: The Derby of Truth Sportsmen, your tonic is Fernet Branca. Fernet Branca Digestion Aid. Sportsmen, try the American Hookshot. Hookshot: very American. I know you, boys, that you'll do your best, to bring victory to our glorious Borgorosso! And I know that you don't need, let's say, any financial incentives but you won't mind knowing, that in the case of victory, here, lies ready for you… … a million! How happy they are. Watch out for the tarantula! "Evil-eye, over me pass. Tarantula, protect my ass." "Evil-eye, over me pass. Tarantula, protect my ass." Attention! Attention! The game is about to begin! It's exactly 2.58 pm. Exact time from a Bulova watch. A man who knows what he wants, wears a Bulova. The space age watch. Borgorosso! Borgorosso! Borgorosso! Borgorosso! Borgorosso! Sangiovese! Sangiovese! Sangiovese! What are you doing? What? Quick! Pass it over! Make the triangle! Continue the action along the line! Watch out for the opponent! Pass to the side! That's it! Good! Go down! Go back to your place or I'll throw you out! Quick! - Sure, I perfectly agree. Get back on the bench and don't get up again. - I'm going. President, it's a bombardment! Celestino, get ready! You're going in! Right away, President Sir! - Come here! On your knees! He who does his teammates ditch? - Is one big son of a bitch! What's on your head? - For the sweat. You haven't started and you're sweating? Defend the goal at any cost. Go! What are you doing? - You push me and hafta ask? Come on, hippopotamus! Defend the goal at any cost! He's in? - Yes, the big one's going in. We've hope in him He cost me 22 million, that's a 150 thousand lire a kilo! Bravo, Celestino! Come on, Celestino! Defend at any cost, you bison! Bravo, Celestino! He's a wall! What a chest! What is that retard doing? Catching the ball with his hands? Penalty! Penalty! 22 million, he cost me! Calm down? I let him in and he gets a penalty? The ball. - Here's the ball. It deflated. What can you do? A ball! Quickly! Here! "Evil-eye, over me pass." "Evil-eye, over me pass." Yes! - A monster! He caught it! What is the referee doing? Referee, you're a cuckold! Cuckold! Filthy cockroach! He's right, President, Testa moved. - Testa? Moved? Why did he move? You're a bastard! It's a true conspiracy! Calm? Maleficent gypsy, help me! Away! There went our chance! Go to that animal, tell him to leave the defense. He must go on the offense! Let him destroy the opponents! Let him go on the attack! - Celestino! What are you doing, fool? Get outta there! Celestino, go on the attack! Destroy them! Leave him alone! We're giving instructions! Come back here! Come to the bench! Don't you hear the referee? That crow! He dresses like a funeral! That's it, President. - Overwhelm your opponent! Pass the ball to Celestino! Was I right? - Yes… Say it! Isn't he a tank? What is it? They blocked him and he whistles at him? Cuckold! What is he doing? - See? Sorry. - Be more careful! This is not football! Excuse me. What are you doing, you animal? And what about you, referee? You can't warn him, he took the foul! Celestino, why are you sorry? You're warning him, but it's he who… - Leave the field immediately! You don't know anything about football! - I don't want you on the field again. You're humiliating a player! I'm President Fornaciari! - Leave! Don't put your hands on me! Go away! - Hands off! I'm President Benito Fornaciari! I appeal to you! Why do we hafta put up with this? No! No! No! What are you doing? Stop! No! No! Don't do this! Stop! Wait! What are you doing? Be good! Are you crazy? Wait! They'll disqualify us! Wait! Listen to me, my friends! They'll disqualify us! It'll be the end! It'll be the end of Borgorosso! I beg you! "The thunder of the league falls on the Borgorosso Football Club." "Eight weeks of disqualification and 1 million fine." "Compensation for damage to Sangiovese, for damage to the team's bus." "Compensation for damages to Referee Donzelli, who also lost his watch." "The President is forbidden from the bench for one year." That's only fair. - Right. The situation is serious. I would even say critical. And I'm not only referring only to the financial side: the fines, the damages. The fact that the proceeds of the team, playing on neutral ground, won't even cover travel expenses. Not counting the morale of the players. - I couldn't care less about the players. Excuse me, Monsignor. The professor has signed more than 100 million in notes. As long as the bills were in the banks' hands, they could be renewed. But since Bulgarelli swept them all up, either he pays or he goes bankrupt. You see, Monsignor? This is the result of my son's madness! And what does this Bulgarelli propose? Commendatore Bulgarelli has proven to be very understanding, due to his friendship with the late president. That's not true at all. They were at odds with each other. Let's cut to the chase. The Commendatore proposes a reduction of 20% and the renewal of all bills, if Benito gives up the presidency. But that's crazy! A ridiculous offer! How dare you? Mind your business. Right, it's not our business. We've only been in this house for 30 years! They come for 3 days and think they're in charge! - I appeal to you, Monsignor, try to convince my son. And tell him that if he refuses, I'll have him banned! A plot! Benito! Open, it's me, Monsignor Montanari. And I'm President Fornaciari! Who do you think you are? I won't be imposed upon by anybody! Not even from the Pope! But I don't want anything. I just want to talk to you, a chat. Between sportsmen. - No! I won't talk to anyone! Try to be reasonable, dear son. I'm not your son. I'm my father's son! I won't give up the Borgorosso presidency! Tell my mother, I won't change my mind! She has tormented me for 30 years. No more! Borgorosso is mine, mine, mine! I'm the President! Benito, we've decided… - While you argue, they're killing each other outside! Benito, where are you going? Stop! Benito! - Benito! Salsiccia is setting himself on fire like a Buddhist monk! He did it out of shame! No! Salsiccia! Why did you do it? Why did you do it, Salsiccia? Let go of me! I want to burn too! - You gotta go. You think, Roman, I'd burn myself for you? We'll burn you, if you don't leave! You'll get the president you deserve! All of you! Mama, let's go. Let's go back to Rome. Guys, he's going away. Our ruin… - It was time for the fool to go away! Here he is, the fool is leaving! Go away! Go away! And don't come back! Go away! - Never come back! - Go home! Is it true you're giving up the presidency? - Not just that. I'm leaving everything. You'll never hear from me again! - Your father would never give up. But he was a man who knew what he wanted! You're not worthy of being his son! You're all against me. All! - That's not true, President Sir. This morning, when we learned that you were giving up, we cried. Don't give up, President. Defend the Borgorosso! Black! White! Borgorosso! Rosso! Rosso! Rosso! Rosso! Black! White! Borgorosso! Rosso! Rosso! Rosso! Rosso! Black! White! Borgorosso! Rosso! Rosso… Mrs Erminia, the president's leaving! - I don't believe it. Friends of the Council, members and members of the Borgorosso Football Club, a serious hour beats on the bell tower of the history of our glorious club. You've all witnessed what happened after the painful disappearance of our great president, in whose memory, I invite you to observe a minute of religious silence. There's nobody. - Go! Go! Be seated. Professor Benito, for his incompetence and his erratic training systems, for his mind-boggling game strategies, brought the Borgorosso Football Club to a crisis. Therefore, therefore, the Council, albeit reluctantly, asked and obtained the resignation of the current President, Dr Benito Fornaciari Valle. Silence! The Council, sure in interpreting the votes of all the members, offered the presidency to our mayor, Commendatore Aristide Bulgarelli! Clown! - Get out! Silence! Silence! We want Benito! Benito! Friends of the Council, members of Borgorosso Football Club, you all know how modest I am. - Crook! - Clown! I hesitated a long time before accepting the heavy inheritance offered to me. - He hasn't come. …the presidency of the Borgorosso Football Club… - Go outside! … just as I restored the municipal budget… - By increasing taxes! - Yes! And selling your pigs to the town! - And trusting to your generosity, I'll work to restore balance to the Borgorosso Football Club! Bravo! Bravo! Very well done! The only thing left is to vote by a show of hands. Those is in favor of the appointment of Commendatore Aristide Bulgarelli to the presidency of the Borgorosso Football Club, raise your hand. One moment! - What is it? There is… I'd like to say something! I believe I have the right. I'm a lifetime member in good standing. Yes, you may speak but be brief, please. Now then, I wanted to say, if we go back to the origins of Borgorosso… - Please, get to the point. If you want to say something, be succinct, understand? - Yes. I understand. And I also understand that you and another, would rather not have me speak! Be quiet, Erminia! Forget it! There he is! You want to kick him out? You're right. Benito is coming. He's here with his Maserati! Tell us another time! - Fine! I'm finished. Then we can move to the vote. Those who agree, raise your hand! Friends! It's me! Allow me! I want to apologize for interrupting. Excuse me, men and women of Borgorosso, for delaying this extraordinary assembly. And you too, Mayor Sir. Excuse me. I had left and didn't want to return. But then I reflected and told myself that maybe my absence would've been interpreted by you as an act of mistrust and resentment. No, friends. None of that. You know that. I have always loved the Borgorosso Football Club team with all my heart! Long live the president! - Hurray! And if I were wrong, friends, it was due to an excess of love. And now, my friends, before I say goodbye forever, allow me to offer you a small gift. I'm sure you will like it, being the great and experienced sportsmen that you are. To play with us and bring back the glorious team to great victories, I brought back from South America, alive, well and in the flesh, Omar Sivori! Thanks to your president, I'm back in Italy. Glad to play before this audience I love so much and who is the most generous in the world. Starting today, friends, Omar Sivori is a property of the Borgorosso Football Club! This is, friends, my gift before I say goodbye. Goodbye! No! Benito, no! Thank you. Thank you. Thanks! Leave me alone! Mayor? What mayor? My foot! You'll pay dearly for this farce! Don't show up at the Town Hall again! And don't come to eat at my house! What do you want? - That note… I'm sending you to jail! All of you! We're ruined. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you! 21 and 32 barrels. 32 barrels of 125 quintals each. Close the inventory and proceed to seal the doors. Medallion depicting Frederick Barbarossa, total value… well, let's say 40,000 lire. Can I clean upstairs? Of course, we'll continue the foreclosure. - OK. Ancient cage, without a bird, 30,000 lire. Go away, go away! It's closed due to bankruptcy! Estate sale: 24 hectares of land, cultivated with vines… The winery is bankrupt, the farmhouse and the land of Tredozio are foreclosed. The bus and the Maserati, the house with all the furniture: all confiscated. Only the bed is left. - I've always said he was crazy. Like his father. Honor the Borgorosso! - Black! White! Borgorosso! Rosso! Rosso! Boys, sit down! The inclusion of our great champion Omar Sivori, guarantees that the Borgorosso, contrary to what all the other Italian teams do, including the National World Championships, will play to make goals, and not to give goals! Long live the Black and White! Long live the Borgorosso! Long live Romagna! Sit down! Onward to victory! It seems that Sivori is still very strong, a true scourge of God. Don't say the Lord's name in vain! - What shit! Yesterday, he scored 3 goals in training. - Yes, it's true. You know what I say? I don't want to miss it. Benito! Wait! I'm coming too! Boys, yesterday I received a telegram from a high Vatican official, Monsignor Montanari. Here is the text: "I disinherit you, I'm leaving all to the Church, I'm no longer your mother!" Sorry boys, I got the wrong telegram. - Benito! Benito! I'm here too! I'm with you! Wretch of a priest! Not with me! With the Black and Whites of Borgorosso! We're with you, Benito! - We're with Borgorosso! Rosso! Rosso! Rosso! Rosso! Long live the Borgorosso! Boys, here's the telegram: "Obtained blessing from the Holy Father for your beloved team." "I humbly join his blessing with mine!" In hoc signo vinces! Guys, let's all go! Football is the nicest game I know! The president I am and I don't give a damn! My only true passion is to form a great squadron! The Borgorosso will be always worthy of my daddy! Guys, let's all go! We'll show them a thing or two! If with Borgorosso, they want to dance, we'll make them shit their pants! Come snow, rain or sun, scoring a goal is quite fun! With that goal then we'll see, who'll move up from Series B! Guys, let's all go! Football is the nicest game I know! He's the president and he doesn't have a cent! We'll all go up against the sun, while you get the goal done! With that goal then we'll see, who'll move up from Series B! Revised English subs by sineintegral@KG
