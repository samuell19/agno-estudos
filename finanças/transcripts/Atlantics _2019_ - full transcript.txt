NETFLIX PRESENTS [mooing] [indistinct chatter] Every time it's "just a bit longer." [man 1] You've been working here three years. Yeah, but we haven't been paid for three months! Those three years mean nothing, we've forgotten them! We want our three months' pay! We want our three months! Don't talk to him on the phone. Make him give us our money! That's enough! [speaking Wolof] [man 2] Earlier, on the site, I told you we were going to pay you today. But we've just heard Mr. N'Diaye is away on business and hasn't left the money. We don't want to hear that. [speaking French] Put that phone down and talk to us! [man 3] Cheikh, I'm talking to you. I don't want a cozy chat. We're here for our money! [man 3] I'm talking to you as their leader. Talk to everyone. - This concerns everyone. - [speaking Wolof] There are four of us. In this office we're working, just like you. Do you understand? What's happening here isn't our fault. [Souleiman] That may surprise you, but not me. We've gone three months without pay. Four now! You know what? Keep the money. But remember that we have families. I know. He's right. Our fathers, mothers and brothers depend on us. [Souleiman] They're the reason we work. I'm so in debt that I wait till 8:00 or 9:00... I wait for it to get dark before I go home. That's not right. That money is our due. [men singing indistinctly] [men singing] [men continue singing] [indistinct chatter] [train horn blaring] [Ada] Souleiman! Souleiman! Take the dress. [Mariama] Ada, you're still seeing that guy? [Ada] Take the dress and go. [chuckling] [Ada] You're just watching the ocean. You're not even looking at me. [Souleiman] You're so beautiful. Even more so today. Don't make fun of me. [Souleiman] It's true! You're even more beautiful. Because I haven't seen you for three days? Yes, maybe. [Souleiman] You're too beautiful. I swear. [speaking Wolof] [chuckles] You're a joker. [Souleiman] Me? Too bad if you don't believe me. Wait... What's wrong? I heard footsteps. Footsteps, here? It's nothing. Hey. There's no one. I heard someone. [man] Hey! What are you doing here? Who are you? - What are you doing? - Who are you? [man] Get outta here! Hey, calm down. [man speaking Wolof] - [Souleiman] Don't talk to us like that. - [man] Hey, don't argue! Out! - This isn't a whorehouse! - [Souleiman] What did you say? - [man] Get outta here! - [Souleiman] Lucky for you... - [Ada] Leave him, Souleiman, let's go. - Get outta here! [laughing] What's so funny? Did that guy annoy you that much? Anyone would get annoyed. Here's your bag. I'm going. - Is that why you're laughing? - Yes, that's why. Okay. I'm going. It's late. - Why so soon? - I have to go. You don't do anything at home. I have to go. Wait a bit. I have to go. It's late. It'll be night soon. I'll see you later. Tonight? What's wrong? [speaking Wolof] I wanted to give you that. It's really nice. Thanks. - I'm going. - You're the loveliest. Why in such a hurry? I wanted to tell you... Tell me what? I have to get back. Tell me later. Come here. - Kiss me again. - Tsk. Wait till tonight. [speaking Wolof] Wait till tonight! I'm going. [pop music playing in distance] What is it? Nothing. - Come for your bag? - [Ada] Yes. Come here. Take your bag. There it is. Mariama. [Mariama] Why the long face? - Did you lose your virginity on the way? - [chuckles] What did you do? Nothing, we just walked. [Mariama exclaims] Ada. You know you're marrying Omar in ten days? Before God. But I love Souleiman. Don't make me laugh! You know what he wants? To sleep with you, then he'll dump you! Forget it, Mariama. Ada! Ada. Ada, we've been friends since we were little. It's my duty to tell you the truth. Hanging out with those sluts has changed you. Nonsense! Keep this between us. No one must know. That's all I'm asking. But... don't you get it? God is testing you. He put Souleiman in your path to test your commitment to Omar. [speaking Wolof] It's obvious. You must be blind not to see that! Mariama, it's okay, I've got it. But can we keep this between us? Okay, then. [chuckles] [kisses] But you're asking a lot. [chuckling] You're crazy! - [coughing] - [Mariama speaking Wolof] Go on! - [Ada's mother] Have you called Omar? - [Ada] No credits left. [Ada's mother] Call him before he catches his plane. [Ada] Okay. [Ada's mother] Call him, okay? - [Ada] Grandma... - Hmm? Are you okay? [Ada's mother] Ada? Beep Omar so he'll call you back. Let's see the dress. [gasps] [Ada] Hello. May God protect us. [Ada] Yes. No. Yes. Okay. Have a nice trip. Is that how you talk to Omar, your husband-to-be? Huh? You shouldn't talk like that to your husband. [Ada] How should I talk to him? [Ada's mother] You speak sweetly to a man. "Darling," "my love," "I miss you"... - "Sweetie." - [Ada's mother] Right. That's good. Otherwise, he'll take a second wife before you're pregnant. Get it? [Ada's mother speaking Wolof] Do you know how many other women would love to be in your place? Hold on to that place. Times are tough! What did you expect? [singing indistinctly] - [girls laughing] - [pop music playing in distance] [speaking indistinctly] [pop music playing over speakers] Ada, the boys have gone. What? Out to sea. Ada. They went in a boat. Souleiman, Cheikh, all of them. [woman] Abdou, my little brother? But Abdou doesn't have a clue about the sea! You know he can't swim! No, no! I don't believe it! [indistinct chatter] It's too late. They've already gone. Please calm down. [speaking indistinctly] [Souleiman on voicemail] Souleiman. [waves crashing in distance] [birds calling] What also worries me is that the club could go bust because of this. [Thérèse] No. Once the girls hear from the boys, they'll be back here to dance. [Dior] Girls come here for the boys, not to dance alone in front of the mirror. Let's pray they get to Spain safe and sound. [breathing deeply] [Mariama] Eat something, Ada. Ada. Eat something or you'll get sick. Leave me alone. [Mariama] You have to get a grip. Don't lose it now. Ada. Aren't you listening? Get up! Ada. Ada. - Get up. - [Dior speaks Arabic] [in Wolof] Ada, are you okay? I'm okay. - You're all right? - Yes. Where's your phone? I couldn't reach you. I was sleeping. [Mariama] Why don't you come in through the door? Can't we stand where we like? Don't start! Ada, come on, let's go for a walk. I don't feel like it. Come on, we'll get some sea air. We won't go far. No, it's okay. - Ada... - Please. [gasps] [Ada] Some old local fishermen come back from fishing with such a full net that everyone follows them to see what they've caught. People rush forward, shouting that they've caught a huge fish. Children and the whole neighborhood come for a look. But as they approach the net, it's not a fish they see there, but Souleiman's lifeless body. [window opens] - [thunder rumbling] - [wind gusting] [thunder rumbling] Ada, come here! Ada, come here! What are you doing? [Omar] I wasn't sure about the color. [Ada] Thanks. [Omar] You'll see, it'll change your life. Do you like it? [Ada] Yes. What's the matter? Nothing. You haven't eaten. [Ada] I'm not hungry. [speaking Wolof] [singing in Wolof] [singing continues] [singing continues] [Omar's father] We're very happy on this great day. And we praise the Lord because it's the day every parent wants. Since Omar's birth, his mother and I have hoped to attend his wedding. Ada, welcome. This is now your home. If you had had a brother, he would never have been as welcome as you are in this house. Only a woman in her nuptial veil. The beauty of a woman comes through marriage. It is the will of God. And it's part of our tradition. Such is the ritual of marriage, which is a divine blessing. So let us praise the Lord. I thank you all. Imam, let us pray together. [speaking Arabic] [Fanta] Wow! [in Wolof] Look at this room! [woman] It's gorgeous! It's really pretty. May God protect you. Ada, congratulations! Thank you. Ada, your bedroom is awesome! I can't believe it. You'd think that... I don't know what to say. [Dior] All right, Fanta... No, but have you seen this room? I'm never leaving here. Omar can marry me, too. [chuckles] I've been seduced by the bedroom! Everything is new. Ada, let's take a photo. Leave me out of it. - [Fanta] Come on! - I don't want to. - [Fanta] Ada, come on. - Leave me alone. [Fanta] Ada, come on! Don't keep nagging. - You show-off! - [chuckles] All right. - Like this. - Look. One last pose. [Thérèse] You're really showing off. You got the jackpot here. The house is amazing. [Fanta] We'll post this one. Ada, just one. Didn't you hear me? [Fanta] One more. Tell Omar I want to be his second wife. [chuckles] She doesn't know her worth. Those girls she hangs around with... Sluts! Hmm. [Ada sniffles] [Dior] Ada. Ada. Ada, I'm talking to you. Ada, why are you doing this to yourself? Look at me. If you can't do this, let's just leave. When I advised you to marry Omar, it was so that you'd enjoy it. Not for this. It was for your happiness. So you'd be at peace. In your own interest. [sniffles] But look at you... Come on, let's go if you can't do it. [Fanta] Are you crazy? You love money more than anything and you're telling her to leave? To go where? Have you seen this beautiful house? Tsk. You witch! It's you telling her that? You're crazy! Don't listen to her, she's full of shit. Fanta, if it was me, I'd gobble up his cash without any scruples. [Fanta] Let her do the same, then. Have you seen her? She can't do it. - [Fanta] Where are you going, Ada? - I'll come with you. But you should understand one thing. Out there is one big struggle. You'll have no father or mother. It'll just be you, all on your own. If you'd rather face that reality than stay in this house of happiness, then let's leave. Don't tell me that Souleiman... [Dior] Fanta! Just look at her and think. [Ada] I'll never love Omar. Who says you have to? You have everything here. [Dior] Fanta, shut up a minute. Look at her, if she's your friend. [Fanta] Omar is only here three months a year, the rest of the time in Italy. You're not thinking. He'll hardly be here. - We'll have the house to ourselves! - Shut up! Ada, I have something to tell you. Ada, come on. Not now. She has something to say. - [Ada] What? - You're not coming? I've just seen Souleiman. He ran away. Souleiman? What? - [Mariama] I saw him. - Why are you lying, Mariama? We saw him. - Where? - Ada, calm down. [Ada] You witch, stop lying! - I'm not talking to you. - [man shouting indistinctly] Did you hear that? - [man] Fire, fire! - [people shouting indistinctly] [speaking indistinctly] [speaking indistinctly] [speaking indistinctly] [commissaire] You'll have to make a statement. It's a formality, but it's important. Just a second. - [commissaire] Issa. - [Issa] Commissaire. - [commissaire] Are you okay? - Fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm fine. Because yesterday you collapsed and... [chuckles] No, it was nothing, I was just feeling faint. Have you seen a doctor? I will, Commissaire, but everything is fine. - Are you sure? - [speaking Wolof] Inspector Issa Diop. Our young star. He'll be investigating. Mr. Niang, the owner of the property. Pierre will give you the file. Pierre! Give it to Issa. The witnesses all say pretty much the same thing. Mr. Niang. Are you going? I'll see you out. Thank you. Guys... [Pierre] Feeling better, Inspector? Yes, I'm fine. Gloves! No breaking and entering? [Pierre] No, nothing was forced. Okay. It's weird, nothing sparked the fire. Nothing sparked it? The mattress just spontaneously combusted? [Pierre] So the firemen said. [knocking] Hello, Madam. Are you Souleiman Fall's mother? Police. Is that him? What's happened to my son? - Where is Souleiman? - He went to sea a week ago. He was seen last night at about 10:00. Where's his room? My son? Where was he seen? Where's his room? Who saw my son? That's impossible. He went to sea. Tell me where he was seen! Who saw my son? - Hey! Sir... - Madam. Listen. No, no... Wait! [Issa] Calm down! He's wanted on a serious matter. Let me do my job. Sir, you can't search through my house like this! [Issa] Madam, let go of me. Where is his room? Where is Souleiman's room? [indistinct background chatter] [waves crashing in distance] [horn honking in background] Look at me. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Where is Souleiman Fall? I don't know where he is. Really? But you know him, don't you? [Ada] Slightly. Hmm. Only slightly? Look at me. Do you know where you are? Yes. Where? At the police station. Do you know why? No. Souleiman... is wanted for arson. And you're helping him. [scoffs] That's a serious matter. I don't understand. - You don't understand? - No. You don't know what he did? - I don't know what's going on. - [speaking Wolof] Okay. You know what you did? You were his accomplice in setting fire to your wedding bed. That's impossible. Really? Souleiman went to sea. He couldn't have started a fire. He went with the others in a boat. A week ago. He's either at sea or in Spain now. You expect me to believe that? You're lying! No. Out of you two, I believe Mariama. She wasn't the only one to see him. Why do you believe Mariama? I'm telling you the truth. [remote clattering] [Issa] Youssef! How many times have I told you about the aircon? I want it fixed by tomorrow! [door slams] [sighs] Huh. Where's Souleiman? I'm telling you the truth. I don't know where he is. He went in a boat. [Issa] Stay here. Inspector. Are you okay? Send Ada Niang home. We'll carry on tomorrow. - [cell phone ringing] - [Ada's father] Who's that? Who's calling you? - Give me your phone! - No, it's mine! - Give it here! - [speaking Wolof] Here! If you'd brought her up right, we wouldn't be in this situation! Dad, give it back. It's no one. [continues arguing] These girls were badly brought up. It's your fault! They must have had good reason to question you. If you're involved in this, you'll have me to answer to. [panting] [inaudible] [panting] - Fanta, drink this. - [groaning] It's sugar. Fanta, what's going on? Huh? You're freezing. What happened to you? I don't know. Where does it hurt? Tell me. [doctor] It looks a lot worse than it is. - [Mariama's mother] Mmm. - [doctor] She just fainted. When Mariama wakes up, - give her two pills. - [Mariama's mother] Mmm. Then two tomorrow after her breakfast. Hmm? [cell phone vibrating] [panting] [vehicle honking] [door opens] [man and woman chuckling] Oh, God! [N'Diaye] Hey. Who are you? What are you doing here? - Well? - [Fanta] Where's our money? - [N'Diaye] How did you get in? - Who cares? We're in now. Laye... what's going on here? Who are they? [woman] He knows. [Fanta] Yes, he does. [N'Diaye] What the hell is this? Who are you? [Thérèse] We'll refresh your memory. Building 13. The tower site. [Fanta] Give us our money! [N'Diaye] Don't fuck with me! You know what? Get outta here! [women chuckling] [Thérèse] Our money. Yes. The 32 million that you owe us. Four months' wages. [Mrs. N'Diaye] I'm calling the police. You hear me? [N'Diaye shushes] Calm down, I'll sort this out. Here's what we'll do. I'm asking you to leave my property. Understand? Don't make me lose my temper. There's no need for that. We've come to warn you. We'll be back. Thirty-two million, our wages. Our money. Give us our money! [women murmuring] [Mariama] Mum... Mum! Mum! Mum! [Ada's mother] Ada. Ada! Hey! Ada! We're going to the clinic. Omar's parents want you to take a virginity test. A test? You leave us no choice. Get up. Ada. I'm waiting. Can I have my phone back? We'll see. I'll wait outside. [speaking French] [in Wolof] Clench your fist. [nurse] Congratulations, Madam. Your daughter is a virgin. - [Ada's mother] Thank you. - [nurse] No problem. Give me back my phone. Don't look at me like I took you to the devil. My phone! You got what you wanted. Your father wanted this, not me. Ada, come here! Where are you going? Hey! Where are you going? - [doctor] No, wait! - It's all right, let me go. The marabout said that a spirit got in through my belly button because I don't dress correctly. Tsk. The marabout is talking crap. Something took hold of me last night. [Dior] Are you serious? You've gone totally crazy. - Don't believe me, then, I don't care. - [cell phone ringing] [clears throat] - [Dior] Hello, Ada? - [Ada over phone] I've called four times! What's up with you? I'm at Fanta's. What's the matter with you lot? [Ada] We have to talk. Come to the fast-food place. Not on the phone. Come now. [Dior sighs] Look how gorgeous you are on that photo. There were no spirits then! [laughs] Dior, you shouldn't joke about it. Just wait till it happens to you. [Dior chuckles] Me? The spirits are scared of me! Dior, swear you won't tell anyone. Tsk. Don't tell me you're possessed by a spirit! Never mind. Tell me. Swear. Swear, for real! - [speaking Arabic] - [waitress in Wolof] What do you want? [Ada] Nothing for me. A coffee. Excuse me. An espresso, please. - What is it? - Swear. - Swear to keep it to yourself. - [sighs] I swear. Now you've got me worried. Souleiman is here. What? Look at his message. TONIGHT 3AM AT DIOR'S SOULEIMAN [chuckles] Seriously? What the hell is this? What do you mean? Ada, it's the police! The police? I've done nothing wrong. Think about it. They want to get you. - Me? - To trap you. I'll call to check. Don't bother. It's Souleiman, I can feel it. Dior... [scoffs] - [man] Hello. - [speaking Wolof] [man] Who's that? You texted me last night. Who are you? [man] I helped out a guy who wanted to send a message. What did he look like? [man] A young guy. I don't know, he looked blind. - Blind? Are you messing with me? - [speaking Wolof] Dior. Stop being paranoid. I'm going. - Ada, no... Tsk-tsk. - Give me your keys. It's a trap. I'm a big girl. Your keys! It's a trap. Dior, I'm a big girl. Your keys! Ada, you can't be serious. Dior. What would I do without you? [Issa] Mrs. Niang. - [Dior] What's going on? - [Ada] Dior, leave us. Move along. - [Dior] Let me talk to her. - [speaking Wolof] Leave us. - [Issa] I'm not done with you. - Don't you get it? I don't know where Souleiman is. You can't follow me like this! [Issa] You don't know the law. Talk or you'll make things worse for yourself. - What do you want? - Tell me where Souleiman is. I've already told you. Souleiman went to sea. No, he started the fire. Look at me. Talk or I'll lock you up. You really want to know? It's true, Souleiman was more than a friend. That's no revelation. Now leave me alone. Where are you going? Let's go. Leave me alone! - Let me out! - [officer] Shut up! Let me out! I haven't done anything! Tell me what I've done! [officer] Don't make me come over there. I haven't done anything. What have I done? [Issa in English] Mrs. Alvarez? [woman in English over phone] Yes, the boat comes from Kafountine, in Casamance. [Issa] That's not the one I'm looking for. [woman] Anyway... The survivors tell us something that maybe interest you. I'm listening. [woman] You know there was a storm a few days ago. Yes, indeed. [door opens] [woman] Hello? [Issa] Yes, I'm here. [woman] They managed to stay afloat. They're fishermen, they're used to it. But the next day, they ran into an overturned boat. No sign of life anywhere near. The boat might have been drifting for a while. It was... It was broken in half. The chances of finding survivors are bleak. Hello? Yes. Yes, I'm listening. [woman] I'll call you back if anything comes up. Okay. Yes, thank you. [woman] Bye, good luck. Thank you. Good luck, too. - [in Wolof] Commissaire. - Issa. Did you lock up the girl who's shouting? Yes, I want her to talk. What's wrong with you? Her husband's here. Let her go. Ask me first next time! [sighs] I couldn't reach you last night. Why? I felt ill again. Have you seen a doctor? Yes, it's nothing serious. If it's nothing, then be reachable 24/7. Right. Some girls got into Mr. N'Diaye's place, asking for money. - Girls? - About ten of them. Put a patrol there from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Got it? I don't want to hear any more about this. Commissaire... Were the girls there about the unpaid wages? What unpaid wages? That's not our problem. They broke in, that's all. Sort it out. I want it to stop. Mr. N'Diaye has done a lot for us. Now let the girl go. [door unlocking] My phone. And my bag. - Is this it? - [speaking Wolof] What is it? What are you doing? What's wrong? - Huh? - Nothing. Did they do something to you? - No, nothing. - So come on, let's go. What's the problem? I'm not coming with you. Are you mad? Did you bang your head? Tsk. Stop it, come on. Leave me alone, Omar. I'm not coming with you. What's going on? What are you waiting for? What is this bullshit? What's got into you? Get in, I don't have time for this. Let me go! Why are you shouting? - I'll shout if I want. - I'm your husband. I'm not your wife! - [Omar] What? - [shouting in Wolof] What? We just got married and you're not my wife? I don't love you. Let go of me! [Omar] She's gone mad! Where are you going? Have you gone mad? You know what? Piss off! You wouldn't give me a hard-on, anyway! She's mad. [muttering indistinctly] I want to sell my phone. iPhone. Two hundred thousand. I'll give you 150,000. No, 200,000. [man] Is it yours? Yes, it was a present. - I'll give you 150,000. - 200,000. - Is that your last word? - Yes. [man] Do you want a replacement? [Ada] That one. [man] Let's discuss the price, then. [breathing heavily] [imam] As soon as she wakes up, Mariama must plunge verses of the Quran into a bowl of clean water, and then pour the holy water over her head. That will instantly drive away the spirits. Then, if your daughter behaves like a good Muslim, says her prayers five times a day and wears the veil, there's no reason for the spirits to come back to torment her. God bless us all. [speaking Arabic] [in Wolof] Thank you. Thanks again. Have a pleasant evening. Mariama? [Dior] Watch carefully. You see this bit? You put it here, - then turn it. Huh? - Mmm-hmm. And pull. The other end is for opening soft drinks and beer. Vodka and liqueurs go in the small glasses. [Ada] Mmm. I hope you're getting this. Soft-drink glass, wine glass, spirit glass. - Got it? - Yes. - You have to remember it all. - [speaking Wolof] [cell phone chimes] Ada... How can you still believe it's Souleiman? You shouldn't go. [cell phone chimes] [waves crashing in distance] Where's the money? [dog barking in distance] We'll wait for you tomorrow at 3:00 a.m. in the cemetery. If you don't have the money then, we'll burn your tower down. [fire alarm blaring] [commissaire] Hey! Hey! Where have you come from? I'm talking to you! Hey! Hey! [knocking at door] [knocking at door] [Ada] Souleiman? Souleiman, is that you? - [Issa] Ada... - [gasps] Souleiman, it's the police! Run! Ada. Ada... it's me. It's me, Souleiman. [Ada] Dior! - I saw... - Ada. - Tell me! - The boys are back. What? [Dior] Ada, wait! [Ada whispers] Fanta? [Thérèse] Ada. Souleiman told me about you in the boat. You know... in your final moments, you unburden your heart. He told me... that he regretted so much not having said goodbye to you. He couldn't. None of us could. Ada. Souleiman... You were the love of his life. He wanted to come back for you. And be yours. It was about 5:00 a.m. It was quiet in the boat. As the sun was rising, the guys were quiet. I thought we were nearly there because I could see a mountain in the distance. I thought we'd reached Spain and we'd finally be able to call you all. I shouted for joy. Then it all happened so quickly. A strong wind whipped up the sea. We were terrified by the power of the waves. Some were shivering with fear. Others were sobbing with distress. What I'd thought was a mountain was a wave. Immense. It lifted up our boat, which collapsed like a building. We were cast into the depths. Chief! The girl has gone. [indistinct chatter in background] MISSED CALLS (3) FROM CAPTAIN SY You know what happened last night? Another fire. A fire is raging and you're sleeping? At Mr. N'Diaye's. Again, nothing sparked it. [Issa] Commissaire, let me do the investigation. Please. Please. Go ahead. Thank you. [indistinct chatter] [women singing in video] [singing] [pauses video] - [plays video] - [women continue singing] - [pauses video] - [typing] [plays video] [vehicles honking] [shouting in Wolof] [honking] [breathing heavily] [Thérèse] Twenty. Twenty-two. Twenty-four. Twenty-six. Twenty-eight. Thirty. [N'Diaye] Let me go. You have the money. [Thérèse] You're going nowhere. It's your fault we're dead. Never forget. I'm sorry. - [Thérèse] "I'm sorry." - [all laughing] You have your money. [Thérèse] Thirty-two million. It's all there. Let me go. [Fanta] Not yet. Dig our graves first. Look, he doesn't even know how to dig. [chuckles] [Thérèse chuckles] That's real work! Dig till your hands burn. [Fanta] Faster! [Thérèse] Every time... you look at the top of the tower, you'll think of our unburied bodies at the bottom of the ocean. [grunts] [waves crashing in distance] [Ada] I knew you'd be back. It could only be you. I'll always taste the salt of your body in the sweat of mine. [Souleiman] How beautiful you are. I saw you in the enormous wave which consumed us. All I saw was your eyes and your tears. I felt your weeping dragging me to the shore. Your eyes never left me. They were there, within me. Pouring their light into the depths. [indistinct shouting] [Fanta's mother] Fanta? [Issa] Commissaire. The case is closed. ["Huvhimi" playing] [objects clattering] [Dior] Come on, girl! [Ada] Some memories are omens. Last night will stay with me, to remind me who I am... and show me who I will become. Ada, to whom the future belongs. I am Ada.
