Your son's not a common man, he's Superman. I'll take him on my wings. Superman, take your cape? - Quiet.

"I wrote salutations for the first time." "I wrote a letter to my beloved." Wow...brother Mehboob, two in one. Well, your brother's filled with talent. But no one recognized me. If someone had held my hand on time... ...then even I would've been in Bollywood. It's all fate. - What about my fate, brother Mehboob? I gave so many auditions? Did you get any reply? He's not hero material. Take a look, he's been chasing after me... Acting never matters here, it's all about looks. Take a look at me. I came here to be a hero and now I am an assistant. Hey laeeq, come here. - Coming. Take a look, assistant. He's not hero material. Will he do a Re-Enactment? What are you saying, brother Mehboob? I do theatre... - Who watches theatre anymore. At least you'll be seen on TV. I don't want to do TV like this ... keep your TV to yourself. You've a loose mind... Do one thing, make your own drama. I get you auditions, runaround and your illusions don't end. It's not about illusions. - Enough! Listen to me. - I am telling you. Stop it. Father said leave the village. Everyone said leave Paro. Paro said quit drinking. Today you said...leave this manor. There will come a day when they will say...quit acting. Enough acting. Switch to the news channel, he'll be here any moment. I wonder why he's late today. Go get some bread. - He must be lecturing someone. He's out to set Pakistan straight after all. Friends, on this joyous occasion... ...your host, your friend Ghalib Kamal present to you... Box in a Box... Cake in a box! Your brother and mine... One in a million. Wait...wait there, Mehboob. Stop Mehboob. Stop. Trying to give us the slip. I wasn't ditching you, I was going to the get the guy... - We'll teach you a lesson now. It's Brother's birthday today. Not today. Where's your boy? - Where is your boy? What happened, brother Mehboob? Please save my life. Please do it. Please. What are you saying, brother? Those tubelight can injure me. I am an actor...it'll ruin my face. What are you making me to do? - I cannot do this. This is acting as well. You would've done it if it was a film, right? - But this is not a film. Don't you get it? It's not a film, brother Mehboob. You are just... I came to get snacks, I cannot do this. I cannot do it. Its brother's birthday. Fine...don't do it. I'll tell them to thrash me. Its brother's birthday. Come on, guys. Come on. What are you doing, brother? - Come and hit Mehboob. Come on, hit me. I got him so many auditions. Happy birthday brother! - But you can't do such a small thing for me. Come on...come hit me. I've seen your friendship. Friends. Presenting before you... The sympathizer of poor... The savior of the weak, And...the brother's favorite! Shehenshah! Shehenshah! "On the cold dark nights..." "...and lonely streets." We got the job done and saved the money. - "On the cold dark nights..." "...and lonely streets." "To eradicate every atrocities." "A savior sets out..." "...and people call him Shehanshah." Please forgive me for any insolence. Life is unpredictable. Who knows whether I'll be coming back from Hajj (Macca) or not? Mirza sir, you're fortunate. No everyone gets the opportunity to go to Macca. Just take my name while praying. Pray for yourself as well, brother. That you win a case before retirement. Otherwise we'll have to call the Guinness Book people. Not lying is a record in itself. Won't your Guinness people come for that? Absolutely right, Mirza sir. By the way, what's your son doing these days? K...k...k...ka... G...g...g...ga! K...k...k...ka... G...g...g...ga! P...p...p...pa! Acting is a dream. Every person wants to be an actor. But only a few become one. Many famous people around the world wanted to be an actors. Did anyone tell you that even Quaid-e-Azam (Mr.Jinnah) wanted to be an actor? But he became a lawyer honoring his Parents wish. And what's funny is that... ...there's not much difference between the Parents... ...back then and those in this generation. Even Parent's today look down upon acting. Anyway, these voice exercises will help you in classical plays. Sit. So...how's your acting coming along? See... Be quiet. He's already been bitten by the acting bug, stop provoking him. Father, there's nothing wrong in it. He's taken after you. Even lawyers act all day in front of the judge. What else do lawyers do? Uncle, I heard that even Quaid-e-Azam (Mr.Jinnah) wanted to be an actor. This is the limit. Not you or me... He's deeming Quaid-e-Azam (Mr.Jinnah) as an actor. If he was an actor... ...then you wouldn't be sitting in this free country. You would be a slave. You would be cleaning toilets in some whiteman's home. He was a great lawyer... he formed this country. What can the greatest actor do? What is the stature of an actor? Listen... Quaid-e-Azam (Mr.Jinnah) listened to his parents. He was obedient. He wasn't useless and disobedient like you. I am tired of telling him over and over again. But he doesn't get over it at all. Just pray that I don't return from the 'Haj' at all. And you can do whatever you like. No one to stop you, or listen to. Don't be disheartened. You know...he's short-tempered. Come son, eat your food. He's apologizing to everyone else, and breaking my heart. Mother, even you think that I can't become an actor? Pray for me... that I become a big actor. The biggest of all. - Yes. Annie, why aren't you opening the door. Go take a look. Brother, it's 10 o'clock, get up. Go on. I should open the door too. Is he in? He's a fine actor. Didn't you see his audition? Acting runs through his veins. Tell Humayoun Saeed to run for cover. Because he's going to blow him away. Yeah. Fine, okay. Who are you talking about, brother? There's an actor, but he's a bit eccentric. I see...go get some tea. Some Cake Rusk too. Take a seat. Sit down. What... What's the role? The role is Humayoun Saeed's boss. - I see. You'll be a factory owner...in the movie. Is it a lead role? One scene. - Tea. One scene? Yes???... I can refuse if you want. Think about it. Do it, brother. And get me Humayoun Saeed autograph for me. It's a film scene. Even flies are visible on the big screen. Think. When 300 people will be watching you in the dark. Even if you breathe, that will get registered. The rest is on your acting. Even the biggest actors...spend all their life working on TV. And this is your first debut... in film. Opposite Humayoun Saeed. Sir, should I open the umbrella? Humayon Sir is here. Lights ready. Okay. Art-department. Sir, this is the scene for today. Bring Me Coffee First, Forget the scene Okay, sir. Get some coffee for sir. He comes late, and then the attitude. Zameer, ready the shot. Turn that way. Brother Mehboob, you said one scene...this is just one line. My brother, please do it... don't be so stubborn. Do it. How about I shift it to the 27th? Brother Mehboob... - Do it. ...sir was requesting. Yes...so did you rehearse the lines? I even rehearsed the hero's lines. - Come on. Stop it. Come on. Yes... You rehearsed these lines, right? - Yes. Okay. Get that out of here. Come on. Okay. Mazdoor, Scene 5 Take 1. Action! "He's not God...who can take our right to live." "The labors who all their lives..." Cut... Leave me. - Humayoun sir, it's "All year, your factories..." Okay, okay, fine, we'll do it again. One more. Mazdoor, Scene 5 Take 2. And action. "He's not God... who can take our right to live." "The labors who shouldered the burden of your factory all year..." "...today they became the factory." Cut! Sir...its burden on the factory! I just said that. You said they became factory. Okay. Okay. Makeup! Didn't you rehearse him the lines? How about some mangoes? What do you think this is? Is this a fair? Get lost. Come on everyone, get back to your jobs. Come on...come on. "He's not God... who can take our right to live." "The labors who shouldered the burden of your factor all year..." "...today they became a burden on you." "With their sweat...their blood..." - Cut. What kind of a script is this? Who wrote the lines? He's really sc**** this. This is unbearable. The dialogues are not right. I just don't get it. We'll do it again. Hold it. - Okay. Mazdoor, Scene 5 Take 3. Action! "He's not God... who can take our right to live." "The labors who shouldered the burden of your factor all year..." "...today they became a burden on you." "They used their sweat... and blood..." Sir, it's fuel... Used as fuel. Right? - Shouldn't I take a pause? I was taking a pause. - Sorry, sir. Sorry. Where did you get this guy from? Who is he? Who is this actor? Who brought him here? Did you? Mazdoor, Scene 5 Take 15. Mazdoor, Scene 5 Take 20. Mazdoor, Scene 5 Take 21. Mazdoor, Scene 5 Take 25. Action! "He's not God...who can take our right to live." "The labors who shouldered the burden of your factor all year..." "...today they... -Sir, factory. Factory, sir. Leave me. Are you a great actor? Then make him do it. Humayoun sir, sorry. - What sorry? Packup. Who is that actor? Humayoun, baby. Get lost. Call Samina. - Juice, sir juice. You spoiled his mood. This isn't done. You should do your scene first. He ruined Humayoun's mood. He thinks he's a great actor. Look at him. Why did you have to be the hero? Couldn't you just stand there and do your job? You think you're a great actor. You'll teach Humayoun Saeed acting. You've lost your mind. You can't do it. You are not an actor. You... You want to hit me...come, hit me. Don't ever come back looking for a job. You get humiliated and get is humiliated as well. Great actor. Get lost. He took the clothes. - Then go get them. What the... 'Brother, father said to collect his things from the court.' Son, for God's sake please don't say no. If our lawyer is absent today... ..then, we'll lose our jobs. We'll have no means of livelihood. - I am not a lawyer. Stop telling white lies wearing this black coat. You're saying you're not a lawyer. - I said I am not a lawyer! I am not a lawyer! - Then who are you? Who are you? Who are you? 'You can never act.' What can the greatest actor do? 'You're not an actor!' What can the greatest actor do? Your honor, since the past many hearings... ...my client and the court's time is being wasted. This is a clear case of down-sizing. Whenever there's recession in the world... ...many people lose their jobs. My advice to my hard working people is... ...that they go and find a new job. Your honor, my client is not God... ...who's promised to give food/livelihood all his life. Yes, he's not God. He's not God who can snatch their rights to live. These labors shouldered the burden of your factory all year... ...now they have become a burden on your factory! Those who used their sweat to fuel your factory... ...and worked under the scorching heat to pay for your air-conditioned rooms! They kept laboring even when they weren't paid their wages... ...even though they knew that you are not God. You built your riches by snatching the slates from their children's hands... ...but did you think, how will their face their children during festivals? Your greed for wealth has snatched their square meal. Firing them from their jobs may not make a difference to your bank accounts... ...but the tears in their children's eyes. It will definitely bring tears in their eyes. You should've been an actor instead. Well done. The court orders... ..to reinstate these people on their jobs. "My heart's beat races fast-fast." "Like I am being cast." "What's done is done." "Now this coat-pant suits me." "I've been given a role...that says I must speak." "Open the doors to good luck." "Sway like crazy." "Spread your wings..." "Spread your wings..." "Spread your wings...and fly away." "Actor-in-law." "Have some sweet." "Actor-in-law." "Come on have some sweet." "Actor-in-law."

"Actor-in-law." "Don't stop no matter who says." "Actor-in-law." "Don't think, just do it." "Actor-in-law." "Look I've become..." Having fun, huh? Never seen a drenched girl before. - I wasn't looking at you. Rascal, where else were you looking at? Are you cock-eyed? Who was looking at you? Rascal, you were staring at me. Bloody pervert. Is this what you learn in college? How to check out the girls? Sister, leave him...leave him. I will slap you... Meenu, what are you doing? Shameless. Meenu, let him go. Now you're gone. Has she lost her mind? Get in the car. Take her away. Who was staring at her? Let's go. Do put this on Facebook! Take this you dog! What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? Everyone was watching. - Exactly. Everyone was watching! It's entertainment for them. Their eyes follow everywhere the girls go. - I see. And what was the scene at the office today? What is this? I think it's a blog. Don't tell me you haven't written this, okay. Are you writing against your channel? Yes. I have written it. And it's true. I don't take money and lie like him. How dare you talk against me? I am Mudassir Sultan. Pakistan's no. 1 anchor! I have one million followers on Twitter. I can ruin your career in one hour. Ather, this is pure character assassination. Character? You're characterless. You lie on television every night. - Hey madam, do you have brains? Stop screaming. - I do. I do. I don't lie like you. You are going to ruin the channel some day. You're getting paid for nothing. You don't have any brains. Bloody fool. I was right, wasn't I? - Yes, of course. Good. Very good. Well...your home's here. - Oh... Okay, thanks. Bye. - Bye. 'You should be an actor. 'Even lawyers act in front of the judge all day.' 'Quaid-e-Azam wanted to be an actor.' 'You should be an actor. 'Even lawyers act in front of the judge all day.' 'You should be an actor. 'You should be an actor. 'You should be an actor. Going on a shoot again? Get me Humayoun Saeed's autograph. 'From today this is my theatre.' 'This is my TV and my film!'

I think I am jinxed I don't used to get roles Now I am not even getting a single case Not a single case. Broken down again. Curse those electricity guys... its blown again. Stop supplying electricity if they can't handle the voltage. This hide-n-seek games everyday... - Yeah, fine. Keep it there. It will cost you 1000 rupees. I just got it fixed 4 days ago. Did I spoil it? It was the electricity department, go argue with them. I feel like suing the electricity department. What? I am a lawyer. Would you like to file a case? I would if I had the money. You don't have to give, you will get compensated. You didn't get this one. Don't listen to him. I'll do it for 500. No one gets paid from the court. Dollar girl is coming out of a van like a Film heroine We have Heard that she has a tattoo on her left hand too Where were you taking all that money? You know what to shoot... do it, I will come in a bit Ok madam, I know Your honor, take a good look at this dead body in the witness box. Dead body? But this is a fridge. - You're right. You're absolutely right. This was a fridge until yesterday... ...for which his owner saved money, every penny... ...even took a share from his children's fund... ...and bought it on installments, your honor. This fridge brought happiness in my client's home. His nine small children. Pappu, Laddoo, Gudiya, Mano, Kashi.. ..Guddu, Munnu, Billoo. And... - Fullstop. Fullstop. Your honor, they would drink cold water after coming from school. Get the camera to the fourth corridor. Now. Sister-in-law didn't have to knead dough all the time. Even the leftover meals from the night would be used in the morning. From eggs to okra...from sweets to medicines... ...this fridge would make life easy for everyone, your honor. This wasn't a means of comfort for just them. When his neighbor Iqbal sir would have guests... ...they would get ice from this fridge. Aunt Jamila's insulin used to be kept in this fridge. In fact everyone was booking for Bakra-Eid, your honor... What do you want? Money. - From the court. The electricity department! Issue a notice! Great. Hello...where are you? We'll be there in 10 minutes, sir. We need this news for the 3 o'clock bulletin. Sir, you'll be really happy today. Why? Did you get Tattoo closeup? Sir, I've an amazing shot... that will make you forget about tattoo. What? This is real news, sir. Run this, sir. It will get ratings. Rating? I see...so now you'll tell me how to get rating. Sir, please. Trust me for once. Run this, sir. This will definitely get you ratings. And if you don't, then you can fire me. Fire you? wow! Fire you? Excellent. Why didn't I think of this? You're fired. Yes...you're fired. You are fired. Fired? I am tired. I am tired of your channel. What do you show on your channel whole day? Baby doll's tattoo? Whether she took two hours for makeup, or four. Some cricketer's wedding... ...and then the breaking news of him having kids. As if it's some dinosaur's child. And when you don't find anything... ...there's Sheila's body or Meera or Mathira. You're not some news channel, you should run a gossip/Masala shop. Keep the tape down! Keep the tape down! It's a channel's property. You can't take it with you. Thanks for firing me. What are you all watching? Do your jobs. Is the news tape ready? -Yes its there Dead people's cases often come to the lower court... ...but for the first time the victim's body's been brought to the court. This body doesn't belong to some human being, in fact it's a fridge... ...who died due to sudden power-failure. Yes...this is a unique case in itself... ...which sounds like a joke to many, but on the other hand it's a question... Brother... - For those who've been mourning over... ...their stuff that short-circuited due to load-shedding. We must watch whether this case makes a difference... ...to the common man and the electricity department or not. This... Wife! I am taking this TV to court tomorrow. What's going on? Quaid-e-Azam (Jinnah) wanted to be an actor. What are you doing here? I am acting. You said yourself that lawyers act in front of the judge. How long will you do it? - As long as I don't get a new role. And...even father wanted me to be a lawyer. Fake lawyer? Now this is a real lawyer. You're fighting for justice... ...the rest are only chasing after money. Son. I've been sleeping amidst mosquitoes for 6 days. I want my fan back. Sir, it's time. Our case is next. - Come. Come on...pick it up. Your method is wrong. But you're doing the right thing. And yes...one more thing. If you ever get stuck... let me know. Yes... Write this under this point. Your honor, there was just one body in this courtroom today. But today it's an entire morgue out here. Objection, my lord. This is more like a madhouse. He wants to turn this courthouse into a madhouse. He's right. He's absolutely right. We're all crazy. We're crazy to pay those long electricity bills... ...and also endure hours of load shedding. And also bear the loss of our expensive items. And if we don't come to the court asking for our rights... ...where else do we go? The electricity office? Where no one ever answers your calls. And if someone does answer the call... ...they first ask your area, then address, then bill number. And what do you get after going through all that? One complaint number. With a condition to call back after an hour. And even if you call after an hour, no one answers. What's that? An hour sir, An hour What kind of language is he using, sir? Is that the kind of language used in the court? My language expresses the condition of my heart. There's no trace of electricity... ...the common people are going through such atrocities. Wow! Wow! Wow! Objection my lord. This is not some poetical gathering... ...where he can sing few lines and get praises. He's not coming to the point, wasting the court's time. I think this case should be dismissed... ...because he has nothing to say. - I've lot to say, your honor. I've a lot to say. Yesterday we had one complainant, today we have 101. Because this entire Pakistan's problem. If every complainant expresses about his problems... ...then it will take days, but this case will never end. And then my learned friend will say that the court's time is getting wasted. My request to the court is that... ...this case shouldn't be treated as a waste of time. And don't close the only door of justice for the common people. I am giving you the next date. And you too...come prepared. We'll show him in the next date. - What... Sir...sir...sir...sir... Sir, do you think the electricity department will pay. Sir... sir... How much are you getting paid ? Sir, please...answer us. Sir, you must answer. Sir, you must answer. Sir... Sir, you must answer us. We'll show this on TV. What's the guarantee that when you do... ...people will have electricity - Move. Sir, answer me. sir... Sir... Sir. Did you see how the lawyer left us speechless? And if he argues like this in the court, then the electricity department is F** oopss.... Shoot that again. "What's the guarantee that when you do... ...people will have electricity." Yes, it is a shock... But this time to the electricity department. As good as 5000 watt. That's what you call a jolt! That's what you call a jolt! Big shock...with a delay. Your honor, I think even their lawyer is experiencing load-shedding. The common man's electronic items are burning up, getting spoilt. If you had been in power, would you have given them compensation? Your honor, their lawyer didn't show up again. Please...take strict action. Strict action. Why not? It's the common man's right. Where are you taking that? - I'll get a new one from the court. Your honor, can we get another date. Even this blew up due to fluctuation. Curse this lawyer. Today on 'Karwa Sach' we're with someone... ...entire Pakistan's been looking for. Ms. Bijli. Listen, will you bring Pappu home from school. I am going to the court with the washing machine. All you do is sleep all day. Why don't you take this machine to the court? The electricity department is giving compensation. Your honor, we don't get electricity... ...and all we get is another date. Date...upon date. Date...upon date. Order. Order. Should I go to the court as well? Would you like to go to the court? - No. We've to go to the station, will you go. Take this machine to the court, you fool. Take another date. - Why, sir? I am not feeling well. Driver, let's go home. Why do you take a up case if you can't defend it? And that too worth 5000 watt. This is called... - Mom, lower the volume. Are you playing it for the entire building? Take a look. The electricity department's been summoned to the court. Look. Shan Mirza is like a ray of hope for the common people. Those troubled by electricity know that they are facing lots of trouble. It's the winter season now. But the load shedding increases during the summer season. You fired me on covering this and then you ran it. Aren't you ashamed? This was my news. My news? Every news belongs to the channel... ...and we make it big. Channel my foot. Earlier this news was nonsense. Now that you're getting ratings, it's become breaking news. You're a liar. You're a shame to reporters all over. Your channel should be called 'Sold'...you sell news. I will break your face... What is he saying? Your honor, the lawyer couldn't make it this time. If we can get another date... I object, your honor. The reason for my learned friend's absence...is his humiliation... ...which he's been displaying since many cases. I apologies, your honor. But these people sitting at the back... ...come here expecting justice from the court. Not another date. If the defense doesn't arrive in an hour... ...then I will announce my verdict. The court is adjourned for an hour. Good one. It's been so long, when is he coming? The judge is very angry. Where is the lawyer? - His phone's unreachable. What do you mean unreachable? I already spoke to him. Don't tell him. Where are you? You said we'll take another date. We have an hour's time. Come immediately. Hello. Sir... Sir...Mr. Lawyer. You know... the claim's worth millions. Think. Don't worry, just watch what I do next. Your honor. I've been involved in this case for a long time now. And after careful thinking... ...I've reached to the conclusion that, my learned friend is right. These people should be compensated for their losses. He's right. They must get compensation. But...not from the electricity department... ...but from the companies that make such bogus equipments... ...which cannot endure one single jolt of electricity. And I am ready to give my learned friend.. ..a helping hand in this case. Thank you. Yes... Your honor, if right here...in the court room... ...my learned friend dies. Then what should his family do? Be patient. - You're right. Your honor.. if today...I shoot you... ..outside the courtroom... ...and you die...then what should your family do? What insolence is this, your honor? Objection over ruled. - Tell me... ..what should your family do? They should file a case against you. Why? Why not against the company that made the bullet, your honor? Is this a joke, your honor? - You're the one joking with us. Who's advising us to file a case against the manufacturers? Wait a minute, your honor. See this, your honor. I've a warranty card from a company which is reliable, your honor. They make fridge, TV, washing machine, microwave and other electronics.

Cases are not lying in my pocket. They just come. Listen son, where is Salim Computer shop. Uncle... Son. - Yes. Where is Salim's Computer shop? Uncle, go straight and you will come across a wall.

But on all the walls in this city... ...which is filled with their advertisements. Their advertisement makes you feel... ...that every man in this country is impotent, women are childless... ...and everyone's doing black-magic. Your honor, these walls have ears... but I wish they had a tongue too... ...and they would've spoken themselves. How these people have tainted their beauty. Be quiet.

Yes, sir. - Of course. Sir has said no writing on the walls. Stop the boys. Hurry up. - Why? Sir, please answer our questions. Sir. If political parties don't write their slogans on the wall... ...where else will they write it? Outside their manors. On their imported cars. On their expensive clothes, or...on their fake faces.

Greetings. - Greetings, uncle. How are you, Mr. Lawyer? Meenu, this is... - Are you prepared? And you? He's the lawyer? - But you filed the case. Your name...Meenu Screw... - Screwala. Yes...Screwala! So you're... - Yes, I am a Parsi. Exactly. Exactly. Ms. Meenu Screwala, according to you people stare at you. You claim that it's their fault. - Of course. No, I mean...did you ever feel that there's a fault with you? Fault? What do you mean by fault? Do I break the signal on foot... ...that I should be stopping by blowing a whistle? Am I am agent for another country... ...that it's necessary to chase me? Or am I an alien that people look so closely at me? No, no, no, you're not an alien. You belong to a respectable minority. Maybe your garb forces people to look at you. Have you ever tried wearing better clothes while going out? What do they call it? When in Rome do as Romans do! Then why are you wearing a pant? When Pakistan's National dress is shalwar qameez. Madam...right now we're talking about your clothes. People stare at you, not me. - Objection my lord. Yes, please speak. My lord, it's nowhere written in section 509... ...that which kind of women can be teased, and which kind cannot. And this law doesn't discriminate any women on the basis of her religion or sect And this law is equal for every women living in Pakistan. Sir, my motive is not to target any minority. The minorities have all the rights in our country. By the way, the white color in our flag is for them. And that's where the pole is too. Order! I will need strong witnesses in this case. I am giving the date for next hearing. 7th January. Court dismissed. Listen, don't you have any friends who are facing the same problems. What are you saying? All the girls have this problem? But all girls don't come to the court. But now they will. Madam, this is the court. Even men are scared of coming here. If you can get a single woman here, consider this case won. Excuse me. He says not a single girl will come. - He's right. No one will come. You won't come either. - Have you lost your mind? With great difficulty I got permission to work. Father will break my legs. Boys always stare, just ignore them. In fact, do yoga. Who amongst you are stared down by boys? So who will come with me to the court? No need to meet her again. - What happened? Better explain her. Uncle, please try to understand. Spare us. The idea's really nice, dear, and I wish you luck. But nothing's going to change. Please father, say yes. No more discussions on this topic again. Concentrate on your studies. Decent girls never go to the court. My mother-in-law will kick me out of the house. This is not America. If you like adventures, then go with your friend and feed poor children. But don't get into such acts. Listen, ask Dilnaz. Tell your daughter to stay away from my Dilnaz! Leave me. Feels like...there are no girls left in this world. I tried talking to everyone I know. I wish I had a sister. - I do. What? - I have a sister. Yes. - Why didn't you say that before? Will she come to the court? We must file a case against these rascals. I will go with you. - Thank you. But father? Excuse me, please take this. Hurry up Annie, we're getting late. The key... This is your acting. You're an imposter. Imposter. A cheater. If you wanted to be a lawyer, why did you leave college? I grew old working hard. But never fed you a morsel of deceit. People will shun me. Humiliate me. How will I face them? Get out of this house! I said get out. No... Rafiya. Rafiya, be patient. We'll think we never had a son.

I filed this case willingly, but a woman is taking this case back. Because she's scared of the humiliation while coming to the court. Your honor, this isn't about a few women. 51% of this country...which means more than half of our population... ...is devoid from getting justice. I've already lost this case before I could defend it. And the reason behind it is all those women... ...who value their honor more than their rights? What's funny is that this honor is not theirs either? It's the honor of their brother, their father, their husband, son... ...and these are the same people who ogle at women. Whistle at them... harass them. And today a woman... ..is withdrawing her case against all those men! Keep the video-link ready. And don't forget the watermark of 'Karwa Sach'. Look, this is a live show, so I want everything. Everything. Polls...sms'...texts. And yes, Faizan keep the DSNG ready. Okay. - Yes, sir. And yes, right after the show... ...we need show comments, the people's opinions. Listen to me carefully. The ratings...are going to go off the chart. - So be it. Of course. - So be it. And I will create history. Camera 3 ready. Sir, call for you from Islamabad. - After the show, my darling. Sir, this sequence... - Give it. Show me. Clean the mirror. - Sorry, sir. Are we ready in the Comm Room? This time I don't want any goof ups in the switching. 3...2...1... Queue. Greetings, and welcome to 'Karwa Sach' (Bitter Truth) with Mudassir Sultan. Live and exclusively, from the studios of Bold News. Today I am going to unmask a ugly face of a man... ...which no one can deny. Neither the courts of this country, nor the law... ...nor the Media or the People. Take a close look at this video! That's the 'Fake' lawyer. This is the man...the cheater, who duped an entire community. This is Shaan Mirza. He's a local brat. He's a Show Off - Wana bee He's not a lawyer. He's just an Failed actor. He's the imposter lawyer, who kept saying white lies wearing that black coat. Carried out publicity stunts in the name of public interest. For the sake of cheap fame... ...he got slogans erased from the walls, but... ...but he tainted the law itself. Is he telling the truth? He used the court as his stage. And degrade all institutes of the country He thought the law is actually blind. But he didn't he know that the media and journalist of this country is not blind. My blood boils saying that he defamed a honest profession... ...like that of a lawyer, which is belongs to Mr.Jinnah The Founder of the Nataion. Now it's time that the lawyers should come out. ...and raise their voice against this man. I request the upholders of the law and the people... ...that Shaan Mirza should be arrested immediately and jailed. And strict actions should be taken against him. Are you with me? I know you're with me. Because the people are always with the truth, no matter how bitter it is. Thank you. Thank you, team. Shaan. Shaan, where are you going? Yes, this is the house. Let's go inside. Come on. We're standing outside Shan Mirza's home. Everyone's looking up, We must see... We must see... We must see... Is the camera ready? - Yes, speak. Right now we're standing outside the imposter's house... ...who thought the law was blind. Father's a real lawyer, and son's an imposter. This is Shaan Mirza's home. Sir...sir, please tell us something. Sir. Open the door. Open the door. You will be defending the case against Shaan Mirza. And you know what it means to win this case. The BAR has decided that... ...no lawyer will defend Shan Mirza's case. In fact, we'll Protest against him. We'll take him to the streets. We'll show the people that we're only with the truth. Go Shan Go! Go Shan Go! Go Shan Go! Go Shan Go! Go Shan Go! Go Shan Go! Go Shan Go! Go Shan Go! Go Shan Go! Country News has done it again. We're inside the accused' home. The place where he spent his childhood... ...and his youth, but now he'll be behind bars. Our channel is the first who's getting inside Shan Mirza's House,.. ..you can see how embarrassed his father looks, who's trying to hide himself .. ..and his family from our camera Rafaqat - Arent you shameful of getting.. ..someone's house with out their permission it's a crime, shame on you .... I thought something is definitely fishy. So I thought it was my duty to tell the media everything. I've told the truth, but I don't know what your duty is. You must do your job now. - Did you take money? - What? Money? - No, no, no...I didn't take any money. I am just doing my duty. We just found out that the accused Shan Mirza has surrendered himself. And the police have taken him in custody. City News is bringing you this breaking news first. Come...come... Please tell us...why did you surrender yourself to the police? Tell us. Shan Mirza. Why don't you answer? You've been exposed. We're bringing you this breaking news. Tell us...answer us. Breaking news! Breaking news! The light has shone... Shan Mirza's been exposed. Breaking news! Breaking news! The light has shone... the liar's been defaced. I told you... no one heard this story before. Everyone just heard what interests them, Because no one's interested in listening to the truth. We understand only what's shown on TV. We're the best lawyers for our own mistake. But for others... we're a strict judge. Shaan Mirza, forget who he is. And remember what he did. And for whom? It's true that he's an actor. But today... he's an Actor-In-Law. Whatever he did, was for the law. And what is the law for? For the people. So whatever he did, he did it for you. Now what can you do for him, you must decide. I think you should publish this in your newspaper. It's our responsibility. Because no Batman or Superman are going to solve our problems. Only a common man will. Now you must decide whether you're with him... ..or against yourself. They say one voice can't be heard in a crowd. But if the same voice becomes a crowd, then it echoes. This is your story, and you must decide its end too. Brother! Listeners, Today Shan needs us! He needs you. Everyone says that he's a liar. But I say there was honesty in his lies too. If you lie for the sake of truth... ...it still remains the truth. And Shan's Truth is way biger than his lie. Today, we all must stand with him. If we cannot do anything for him... ...then no one can do anything for us in future. If he cannot be pardoned... ...then none of us are worthy of being pardoned. None of us are worthy of being pardoned. The law is really blind, sir. Your honor, today there's a lawyer in this witness box. I am sorry... Let me correct myself. An imposter who was impersonating as an actor. Who's been trying to fool court of law for so long, Your honor, every lawyer is a harbinger of truth and justice. But he's stained this profession with lies.. ..and deception. We should mistake his crime as a trivial one. In fact, we should make sure that he meet dire consequences. Infact, we all should make him an example so that no one else should do anything like that I request the court, that it decides in the favor of truth... ...and against the fake. We make the witness' swear to tell the truth. But maybe now we must make the lawyers swear... ...so that they fear the wrath of God while telling a lie. That's all your honor. The prosecution has recorded their statement. Is the defense ready? You can't even defend your own case today. Who is the accused Shaan Mirza's lawyer? The accused Shaan Mirza's lawyer come forward. The accused Shan Mirza's lawyer come forward. I am his lawyer/Defendant You said no one will take his case. His existence doesn't matter. He never won a single case. - I see. Your honor, I am advocate Rafaqat Mirza. The defense lawyer of the accused. Although I have nothing to say in his defense. I know...he's a fake lawyer. And he doesn't have a degree in law either. But still he represented the common people problems in the court. He spoke for them. And that is a crime in the prosecution's opinion. Your honor, it's a crime in the view of the law as well. I request my learned friend... ...to defend this case as a lawyer, and not just a father. Because the court gives importance to justice, and not emotions. And justice also suggests that we must find the truth. It is very important for the prosecution to win this case. And the reason is, if he wins this case today... ...then tomorrow he'll be considered as one of the biggest lawyers of the city. His pictures will be posted in the newspapers. Every channels will be praising his capability. And in order to achieve all this... ...the prosecution is using this court as his weapon... ...and provoking a capable judge like you to give a verdict against my client. You know better, sir. This court is not a medium to fulfill someone's personal interests. It's for giving justice. The judge and the lawyer who do justice... ...have a responsibility to examine the intentions behind the actions... And I can surely tell you... ...that my client had no ill intentions. Objection, your honor. - Over-ruled. Please continue with your arguments. Your honor, if this young man loses today. Then it won't be only his loss. It will be a loss for all those people... ...who have come out of their homes, and to the court... ...in order to testify about his goodness. It will be a defeat for all those who want to do something good for the country. It will be a defeat for that labor who wants to fight for his right. It will be a defeat for hopes. It will be a defeat of good intentions. It will be a defeat for the people. And it will be a victory for a system... ...that lets a minister without a degree spread corruption... ...but doesn't let a common man do a good deed. Objection, your honor. - Objection over ruled. Your honor, my motive here is not to go against the law. But looking at the conditions, and as we see... ...that we can't doubt the good intentions of my client. So...I would request the court to give him a warning and let him go. But with the advice, that along with doing a good deed... ...degree is a must. That's all, your honor. The court will resume after the break. Thousands of people are holding their breath. We must see who wins. The people or the system. This crowd of people is evident... ...where there's no act of law, there's a Act of God. Media has done its job. Now the court will do its part. But it's an open and shut case. Shan Mirza is guilty, it's been proven. We must see how he's penalized. Now excuse me, please. No, no, I am sorry. Please excuse me. Sir, what do you think the verdict's going to be? Whatever the verdict, we'll benefit from it. I never won any case. But I won't lose today. I am proud of you, son. I am proud. After examining all the aspects of the case... ...the court has reached on a conclusion... ...that the accused Shan Mirza Being a common man he crosses his limits, and he did contempt of law so the court finds him guilty. The court finds him guilty till the rising of the court. Shaan Mirza is a culprit...but only till this court is dismissed. These people need a leader like you. Don't disappoint them. My dear friends. Pakistan is at a verge where we're surrounded by countless Problems. But I...as the prime minister of Pakistan... ...I assure you, that the day is not far when our country... ...will rise as a new power. Cut it. What a shot. Wow sir, what a shot. - Thank you. What a shot. Bravo, sir. Wonderful. Hello. - Come in your balcony. Why? - Come on. I see...coming. How am I looking? - Like a hero. Will you marry me? - You forgot. I am a Parsi. Even Quaid-e-Azam married a Parsi.
