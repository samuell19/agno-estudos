What is that? Could that be one of those gemstone dolphins? I've never seen one of those! Boys, let's bring him in! You're a frisky one, aren't ya? Yeah, she's gonna pay a pretty penny for this one. Let's make a move! No... Emerald! Don't worry, I'll come after you. You guys stay here so they can't catch you. I'll find him. Whoa! Is this whole place ours? Sure is. Not bad, huh? Not bad at all. It's even better than it looked online. Hey, look, there's even an upstairs. It's like a treehouse! So cool. Wow... If I'm dreaming, don't wake me up! Speaking of dreaming, I can't wait to sleep on these cozy beds. You can see the whole resort from here. It's awesome. Whoa... And there's even a slide! What? We have a slide!? Where's Mr. Floatie? I'm going in. Hmm... Huh? Wow... These binoculars are super powerful. Thanks for getting them for me. No prob. It's the least I could do for you and your foot. You see Ken yet? Uh... There he is! Aw, he caught a sweet wave! Must be nice. Do you know how disappointing it is to sprain your ankle right before going on vacation to a beach that has the best waves in the world? I know, it's beyond a bummer. I'm not saying we won't miss you, but I'm sure you can find other cool stuff to do. Collect some shells, check out the birds, build sandcastles? Building sandcastles is not really an extreme sport. Besides... you've never gotten sand inside a cast, have you? Not exactly comfortable. Nope. You've got me there. At least you get the cast off tomorrow. I can keep you company till then! Thanks, Chels. Oh, check it out! Our own blender and fresh fruit. We can make smoothies. Easy does it, little guy. I'd love to trade places with you, Stace, 'cause, frankly, I'd prefer to stay inside and work on my photo blog. But how are you going to get that prize-winning underwater shot if you don't actually go in the water? Good point. Hey! What do you think? All settled in? This place is amazing, Ken. You're so lucky to be doing your marine biology internship here. And we're super stoked to be here! I'm so glad you guys could come visit. Have you seen any mermaids yet? Mermaids? Chelsea, Ken's here studying real sea life. Mermaids live in the sea. Just because you've never seen them doesn't mean they're not real, Skip. Well, have you seen any dolphins? Dolphins? No. I'm mostly studying starfish and sea urchins. And by "studying," he means "cleaning their tanks." Yeah, you're right. But I've got another hour before I have to get back to work, so who wants to see the reef? Me! I wish. Skip, you're coming, aren't you? Hey! Stop it! Slobber attack! Good thing this is waterproof. Come on, Skip, let's go get ready. I'm coming, I'm coming. Whoops! Almost forgot this. You gonna keep an eye on us, Stacie? Or are you gonna check out some cool birds? Nah. Bird-watching is for... the birds. People are much more interesting. We could just snorkel at the surface, but I'd recommend free-diving if we really want to get a good look at the reef. What are we gonna see down there? It doesn't look like much from up here. Just wait, Skipper. You'll see. Technically, you're not supposed to dive in like this, but... Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Here goes nothing. Whoo-hoo! Come on, Skipper. Hmm? ♪ I can light up the world ♪ ♪ in the blink of an eye ♪ ♪ You'll see something you've never dreamed ♪ ♪ You won't believe your eyes ♪ ♪ I'm holding stars in the palm of my hands ♪ ♪ I'll make them fly I'll make them dance ♪ ♪ It's such a sight if I just take a chance ♪ ♪ So beautiful, so wonderful so magical ♪ ♪ So beautiful, so wonderful so magical ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ Huh?

You guys saw that sea creature, right? Yeah, but I never got a good look. Do you know what it was? No idea, but it went that way. What do you say we follow it? Sure! I have time. What's that, Mr. Floatie? You say you can't get enough of this slide? Well, neither can I! Whoo-hoo! Huh? Whoo! Stacie, are you still people-watching? Nope. I'm watching Barbie, Ken, and Skipper on the boat. Are they coming back already? Doesn't look like it. They're headed in the opposite direction. Let me see! Where are they going? What is that thing? No fair, it's a bright green dolphin! A green dolphin? You're dreaming, Chels. See for yourself. Are you kidding me? Told ya. We have to go check it out! What are you talking about, "we"? You can't even walk! Huh? I souped up my ride. Whoa, sweet! Let's go! Whoo-hoo! Hey, wait up! Emerald! There you are! I'm so happy I found you. Are you okay? I know. We need to get you out of here. I can't get this open. It's stuck. Hmm, there must be a way. Don't worry. I'll figure it out. Gotta go, Emerald. I'll be back. I'm pretty sure whatever it was we saw was headed in this direction. Wow, what is this place? This is the research facility where I work. Come on, Chels, move those feet! Yeah, I'm trying! Wow! Whoa! Hey, guys, what are you doing here? Barbie! You have to see! What is it? It's a dolphin. I know, but he's green. Looks like the puppies are curious too. I think he likes you, Taffy. Hi there, little guy. I've never seen anything like this. Neither have I, but the locals talk about the myth of the Gemstone Dolphins. I thought they were just stories, like the Loch Ness monster. Is he supposed to be in here, Ken? Hmm... I don't know. I was told this pool was for rehabilitating sick or injured animals. He doesn't look sick or injured. I wonder if he got himself in and can't get out? He seems like he wants out. Hey! Get away from there! Ken, what are you doing? Why would you endanger this animal by opening the gate? We weren't opening the gate. We thought maybe it was ajar, and he got in by mistake. And how would you know? Are you a dolphin expert? Well, no, of course not, but... Uh, Marlo, this is my friend, Barbie. Barbie, this is Marlo, my... boss. Oh. Nice to meet you, Ken's boss, who I've heard so much about. He just seemed like he wanted out, so I thought maybe he was trapped. He isn't trapped. Can't you see he's sick? He's under observation. He doesn't seem sick. Hey, I'm the expert! Uh, Marlo, is this one of those Gemstone Dolphins? It doesn't have the special markings, and I thought they were just a myth. Uh... No, they're not real. People just make up stories about things they can't explain. You mean like mermaids? They're really just dugongs, right? Right. But mermaids are real! Anything is possible, Chels. Marlo, are you sure he's sick? Look, this dolphin got caught in a fisherman's net and needs to be checked out. The vet is flying in from the mainland tomorrow afternoon. He'll give the dolphin a thorough examination and decide if he's ready to be released. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like my research assistant back. Sorry, Marlo. I'm here. Can we help? No. I don't think so. In fact, I think your presence here is stressing out the dolphin. I'd ask you not to come back until the vet arrives tomorrow afternoon. But we just got to meet him! Then it will be all the easier to say goodbye tomorrow. Time to go. Let's leave him be. After you, Marlo. Obviously. Whoa! What are you? Shh! Shh! Quiet down, dolphins of the land. That's it, nice and easy. Now, don't tell anyone you saw me, okay? It'll be our little secret. Whoa! It's been a while since I walked on these land legs. How do I get you out of here, Emerald? What if I just... Shh! Okay, okay! I know you're excited, but you've got to keep it down. Wait! Where are the puppies? They must be back at the cove. I'll go get them and meet you back at the resort. Better not let Marlo catch you. I won't. I'll be right back. Huh? - I know, Emerald, I'm trying. - Stop. What are you doing? Uh... nothing? You're trying to open the gate. Well Yes. It seems to be stuck. It's not stuck, it's locked. Well, then, give me a hand. No, stop, you shouldn't be doing that. Why? He needs to be free. But he's sick. What? What are you talking about? Well, the dolphin expert says he's sick. He's not sick. He's fine. How do you know? Do you work here? No. So, do you live here? No, but I grew up on an island, a really remote island. Okay, so... So I've seen enough dolphins to know he's not sick. He's a Gemstone Dolphin. He's supposed to be this color. Really? That's amazing! Wait, how do you know about Gemstone Dolphins? Have you seen one before? Uh, yeah... a few. There are more of them? Marlo said Gemstone Dolphins didn't exist. Who? Marlo's the dolphin expert. The one who said he's sick and needs to stay here. Doesn't sound like an expert to me. Look, I agree that the dolphin should be free, but... But what? But Marlo's got a vet coming in from the mainland tomorrow. She said the dolphin got caught in a fisherman's net, and that he needs to get checked out before he can be released. I'm sure you're right, and he's completely fine, but isn't it better to be safe than sorry? It's just one more day. Hmm... Okay, I'll make you a deal. You don't tell Marlo about the other Gemstone Dolphins, and I'll wait until the vet arrives tomorrow. Deal. Well, I guess Emerald approves. Emerald? You know his name? Uh, well... I mean, he's green, so the name sounded right. It suits him. It suits him. By the way, I'm Barbie. I'm Isla. Nice to meet you, Barbie. Are you here on vacation with your parents? Oh... No. I'm on my own. So are we. Hey... Since the vet won't be here till tomorrow, why don't you come hang with me and my sisters? Uh, well... Unless you have somewhere else to be. Not that I can think of. Great. Follow me. I'll see you tomorrow for your release. You're gonna love my sisters. Hmm... See any cool birds? I could add them to my photo blog. Birds? Uh... no. I'm watching people, remember? What? Huh... I'd suggest you keep an eye on your stuff if you go to the beach. Puppies, you're back! Who wants treats? Hi, guys. This is my new friend, Isla. - Isla, these are my sisters, Skipper, Stacie, and Chelsea. Hey! Hi! And you've already met the puppies. Aw... Hi again! Wow, she really likes you. Don't forget, it's our secret. Hi! I'm Chelsea. Where are you from? Are you on vacation? Do you have any sisters? I'm from a remote island place. No sisters, just me. Lucky. Hmm. You trying to tell us something? Kidding! I'm just really sick of hand-me-downs. Are those pics from today? Yeah, I got some good ones. But I can't stop looking at that mysterious thing we saw. I can't tell what it is. Well, you know, there are lots of weird creatures in the sea. It could be anything. Hey, maybe it's another Gemstone Dolphin. What? - Where? I thought you weren't going to tell anyone. Sorry, I thought you just meant Marlo. Sisters tell each other everything. Well, just make sure you don't tell Marlo. It'll be our little secret, okay? You can't trust humans, you know? Humans? I mean people. Hang on, is that a sandwich bar? Did you say sandwiches? No one loves sandwiches more then me. You mean like a witch made of sand? You crack me up! A little help here? You're on your own, Stacie. See ya there! Hmm. Look out! Coming through! Whoa! Ah! She's really fast on that thing. I'll take one of these, and... another one of these Guess I'm not the only one who likes sandwiches. Look at all this food! Where do we even start? How about over here? Whoa... Huh, what is this? Uh... bread? Hmm. Mm! Oh... I love bread! It's so... dry. You're quirky. Listen, Hugo, can you make it here earlier than tomorrow afternoon? Good. I want this to be done before we have an audience watching. See you bright and early. Don't worry, little dolphin, you're going to make me a lot of money. These s'mores are the best! See if you can follow it. It's so obvious. That one. How did you do that? Hey, guys! Well, look who finally made it. Oh, wait, this is perfect! Group selfie! Smile, guys! Whoo-hoo! Whoa! Isla, have you met Ken yet? He grew up next door to us. We think of him like family. Nice to meet you, Ken, I'm Isla. Hey! He's interning here with Marlo. Oh. Hey, Isla! Huh? So, you're playing shells, huh? You know it. She's been trying to beat me for years. You mean you've been trying to beat me. You ready? Bring it! Here we go again. Round and round she goes, where she stops, only I knows. Sorry, it rhymed. Oh, I got this. That one. You're good. Just not that good. What? What can I say? I got skills. Aw... Whoops! I got it. Huh?

Well, I clean the tanks where we keep the starfish, and... Why do you keep them in tanks? So Marlo can study them. Oh. That doesn't seem right. Where's your cabin, Isla? My... cabin? Yeah, where are you going to sleep? Oh... I'm sleeping on the beach. She kills me, this one. Wait, you're serious? Why not stay with us instead? We have plenty of room. And I can take the puppies. That's perfect! Thanks, Ken. Isla, you in? Okay. You know what this means, right? Sleepover! I think I ate too many s'mores! Whoo! Here you go. Thanks. Always carry a spare. She's, like, uber-prepared. Oof! Hmm... Well, thank you for letting me borrow your clothes, and this, um... Uh... toothbrush? Right. We love an excuse for a sleepover. Whoa! Heads up! This looks great. Oh... This is the softest thing in the world. If I slept on something like this, I would literally never get up. Ever! Well, I guess the sleepover has officially moved to the "sleep" part. Okay... Isla... Isla, are you awake? Huh? Isla..! Chels. Whoo-whoo! ♪ I get my boot off today ♪ ♪ I get my boot off today ♪ Whoo! That's great, Stace. That's right, I almost forgot. Well, she's gotta get up sometime. Whoa, impressive. She was serious. She's never getting up. Hi, Honey! Cutest alarm clock ever. Hi, guys. Bye, guys. Sorry, duty calls. Ken, wait! When does the vet get here? This afternoon. The dolphin looks great. I'm sure the vet will give him the all-clear. I hope so. We'll come by later to say goodbye to him. Cool! I'll see you guys there. How's it going over there? Nothing. I think I know what'll work. Breakfast sandwiches! I'm up! Mm... Who knew sandwiches were good any time of day? It's official, you like sandwiches way more than me. That was great, but now I need to go see Emerald. I don't think there's much we can do until the vet arrives. Plus, Ken is there. He'll look after him. Hey, how about we go for a swim? It'll take your mind off of it. Uh... I don't know. Oh, come on. Okay, sure. Let's go! Whoo-hoo! Ah, Wow! Gemstone Dolphins! This is amazing! Look at their colors! This is so cool. Isla, this is incredible. I know, it never gets old. What? You've done this before? Uh... Ruby! Wait, "Ruby?" How do you know her name? Hey! Ruby, no! Uh... What in the...? Isla? So... You're a... Mermaid. Yes! A mermaid! But, but... Don't freak out, okay? Are you kidding? This is the coolest thing ever! I mean, how did this happen? Were you born with a tail? Do you have magical powers? Can you talk to dolphins? Are you even human? Slow down. Yes, I was born a mermaid, with a tail. Magical powers? I guess so. Your necklace! Uh-huh. The necklace lets me switch from tail to legs and back again. But Ruby knows the trick, and likes me better with a tail. I can't exactly talk to dolphins. It's more like we "get" each other. Barbie, this is Topaz... Amethyst... ...and Ruby. Guys, this is my friend, Barbie. Hi, guys! Nice to meet you. Show off. And no, I'm not technically human. But listen, remember what I said about not being able to trust people? Yes, but I would never... Not you, Barbie, of course not. But not everyone is like you. Some people would try to take advantage of others' specialness. You can't tell anyone, not even your sisters. But... Not because I don't trust them, I do. But the more people who know a secret, the more chance it will get out. Of course. I understand. Your secret is safe with me. I promise. Thank you. I just need to know one thing. Yeah? Can you teach me to swim like a mermaid? I think so! You're already a really strong swimmer, but... this will help. You'll have more power if you move your legs like they're one. So cool!

You go, girl. It's good to be out of that boot. But it was kind of nice to be forced to just sit and stare all day. More like stare at people all day. What? I've been observing nature. But now I can do all kinds of stuff, like body board, and surf, and swim with that green dolphin. Easy there, tiger shark. One thing at a time. Besides, I don't think Marlo's going to let you anywhere near that dolphin. Yeah, she seems a bit strange. Yeah, I know what you mean. Hmm... I think I could get more out of this image. I'm running it through a filter. Hey, Skip, check out the helicopter. Sweet! Photo op! Hey, Marlo's waving it in. That must be the vet. That's him? I thought he wasn't coming till this afternoon. What? Now you're both people-watching? I thought Stacie getting out of the boot meant we could go do stuff. It does. Let's go find Barbie and tell her the vet is here. We don't want to miss saying goodbye to Emerald. Huh? Hey, wait up! ♪ Say it loud say it proud ♪ ♪ We gotta live in the moment, moment ♪ Hey, do you hear that? It sounds like Emerald. I wonder why we can hear him this far from the cove. Come on! The clicking came from this spot. Hey, there's a cave down there! Really? Perhaps it's a tunnel to the cove. Wait here. I'll go check it out with Ruby. I'll just be here, uh, floating. Any luck with that mystery image? This filter is taking forever. Whoa... That's some serious machinery. Rookie, Taffy, wait up! Follow those dogs! Man, that crab gets around. Aw... cute walrus! Hmm, kind of a weird logo for a vet... The sooner we get him out of here, the better. I want him transported to the mainland facility safely and immediately. That Gemstone Dolphin's gonna make you a fortune. And my rates just went up. Let me be clear. That dolphin is going to make me a fortune. You won't see a dime of it if we don't take off in an hour. Get everything ready. The sooner we get him out of here, the better. Did I just hear that right? So he's not a vet? No, and we need to find Barbie, quick. Come on, Skip. Hang on a sec. What did you find? There's a maze of tunnels down there, but it's too confusing. We kept getting lost. Right, Ruby? Ruby? Where'd she go? And where's Amethyst and Topaz? They must have headed to the cove. Aw, you look scared. Don't worry, little buddy. The vet will be here soon... Ken! Stop pestering that dolphin! Uh, I was just checking on him. He seemed sad. He's fine. See? Huh? Are those... It can't be. Ken, quick, open the gate and let them in. They're stressing him out! Uh... what's the code? 4-8-3-5-6. Huh...? The markings... An entire family of Gemstone Dolphins! I can't believe this. Ken, quick, close the gate! Are you sure? Now! Before they get out! You're the boss. Don't let them out. I'll be right back. I knew there was something weird about Marlo. Really, Honey? You have to go now? Fine... Hugo, I'm on my way, and we're gonna need more nets. Quick, it's Marlo. Hide! What's she doing out here? Shh! What? You need more time? Who's she talking to? Shh! The image. It's a mermaid! It's a real mermaid... Shh! Hold on. Who's there? Hmm... Anyway, just make it quick. Come on, let's go. Oh no! The dolphins! Hey! Open the gate! Ken, what are you doing? Marlo wanted to bring them to make Emerald feel more comfortable. He's stressed. She didn't bring them in. She trapped them. You need to let them back out. What are you talking about? Ken, please help. I'll explain later, I promise. Uh... Please, Ken, we don't have much time! Okay. I... think I can remember the code. What? That's gotta be the number! How is that wrong? She just told me! I never should have trusted you! I could have gotten him out on my own, but now they're all trapped! Isla, I'm so sorry. I didn't know. No. You didn't. I'll figure it out myself. Isla, wait! Barbie! Marlo's up to something! This guy, Hugo, arrived by helicopter, and he's definitely not a vet! What? I took a picture of the logo from the helicopter and ran a recognition scan over the web. The helicopter is from a sideshow company, and Hugo owns it. Are you serious? Oh, and Skipper saw a mermaid. That picture I took? It's of a mermaid! Isla... Really? A mermaid? Marlo wants the Gemstone Dolphins for herself! That's exactly what Isla said. Marlo? How could she? She's supposed to be helping the dolphins. Okay. We have to get them out of here. Ken, you've got to try the code one more time. All right, I'll give it a shot. Too many passcode attempts. User locked out. New code sent to master device. What!? Ken, what's the master device? It must be that little remote Marlo's been carrying around. I wondered what it was. Hmm... Okay, I have a plan, but I'm gonna need everybody's help. You got it. Sure. Ken, you're with Chelsea and the pups. You need to keep Marlo occupied long enough for Chelsea to get the master device to Stacie and Skipper... Skipper, once you have the master device, you need to sync it to your tablet, and download the new passcode. Stacie, you're going to be the eyes and ears of this operation... I'll come up with a distraction if we need it. But first, I need to fix things with Isla. Hey, Isla. Hello, Barbie. Isla, I was wrong. I'm sorry. You were right about everything, Marlo isn't to be trusted at all. She does want to exploit the dolphins. I'm not surprised. I can't take it back, but I can say I'm sorry. I have a plan to fix it, but we need your help. Count me in, and thank you, Barbie. Showtime. Hey, Marlo! Hey, how's it going? Having some lunch, I see. Good lunch? What's for lunch? Ken... Finished your morning tasks already? Yup. I cleaned the palm fronds out of the tank, and checked the water level. Then... I recorded the temperature and collected a sample. I checked the sample in the lab. Boom! Looked like normal wet, wet water, nothing fishy. Fishy... Anyway, uh... What's next? What are we doing next? Gross! Who let a dog in here? Gross, gross, gross! I'm allergic to fleas! Aah! There's one on me right now! Get them out of here! Shoo! Out! Is this your dog? Oops. Sorry. I'm trying to eat. Go play somewhere else. Okay. So, Marlo... What-what are we doing next? Swimming with the dolphin? Uh, playing with the dolphin? Feeding the dolphin snacks? Here you go. Nice work, Chels. We have dolphin snacks, right? We do not have dolphin snacks. Go check the radio antenna if you're looking for something to do. Come on, come on! Great! Great, gr...eat! Great. Consider it done. Uh, then, then... then what? Why don't you start with that for now? I've got to go. Clear these. Now! What was that? Huh? Where did it go? A mermaid? It's hanging! Get back there and be ready! Oh, uh, keep watching! It might come back! We're running out of time. Come on! Yes! Done! Quick, put it back! Huh, I guess it's gone. Well, we could wait for it to come back, but, uh, I don't think it's gonna. Huh? Well, I better get back to work. Hmm... Whoo-hoo! You guys were amazing! And you came up with a brilliant plan, Barbie. How did you get Isla to look so much like a mermaid? Oh, we just improvised. Special effects and stuff. I can't thank you all enough. But especially Barbie. You've been such a good friend to me. And it's a hard thing to ask a friend to keep a secret for you. Especially from her sisters. What? So... Huh? Wow! Whoa! A real mermaid! You're the mermaid from my photo! See? I rest my case. Thank you guys for keeping my secret too. And these are my puppies of the sea. You know Emerald, and this is Topaz, Amethyst, and Ruby! Cool! Wow! Sweet! Hiya, guys! Now, let's get you out of here. Yeah. I'm on it. Here comes freedom! Yeah! Yeah! What? User locked out. New code sent to master device. That should have worked! It can't be. Come on! Come on! User locked out. New code sent to master device. You looking for this? When I realized you'd hacked my device, I reprogrammed it. But it doesn't matter. I'm taking the dolphins out by helicopter. I don't actually need to open the gate. No! You can't do this! Already done, sweetheart. What? Where are the dolphins? I didn't want to spoil your dramatic moment, but... they escaped. There's no way they could get out! They're probably miles out to sea by now. Hugo! We've got to get that helicopter in the air! Do you think they really got out? I'm not sure. Where were you? We found a hiding place which was actually a tunnel. I thought it might be connected to that cave we found earlier, Barbie, but we couldn't find a way through. Every turn we took led us back here. If only we had some way to guide them through the tunnels, some signal from the other side. Barbie, you're a genius. I've got something that might do the trick. Really? Wow! Here, take this. Go to the rocks on the other side. When you get there, hold this in your hand. It's something mermaids use to find each other in the vast ocean. If two merpeople each hold a shell, it creates a current of light and color that can be followed underwater. It should also work with friends of mermaids, and it will lead me right to you. Great, we'll give it a shot. Let's go, Stacie. Wait, hold up, Stace! Here, take this in case your leg gets tired. Thanks, Ken! We'll stay here and keep an eye out for Marlo! Sounds good! This is the spot. Keep an eye out for the helicopter. Got it! Whoa! Whoo-hoo! Yes! It's working! We'll see you on the other side! Yeah! Whoo! Huh? Oh no. What? They were there the whole time? Follow them, Hugo! They're escaping! Let's go. The magic is working, but they haven't made their way through yet. The helicopter! Hide! The magic stopped, and there's still no sign of them. Oh no! Yes! It worked! You made it! Barbie, thank you, thank you, thank you! Get in! We can get you out of here, fast! Hurry, hurry! What do we have here? Ken, Go! Oh, ho, ho... You want a chase, do you? After them, Hugo! Try to lose them, Ken! They're still on us! What are we going to do? Faster, Hugo, keep on them! They're trying to out-maneuver us. What? Where are they? We can't let them escape! I think we lost them, but not for long. We need a plan. There's a fast-moving current just off shore. If we can make it there, we can get far away quickly. Then I guess this is goodbye. I'm going to miss you, Isla. I'll miss you too. Here. This belongs to you. Please. Keep it. Uh, guys? It's getting really shallow here. Hold on! Whoa! This is as far as we can go. They found us! There! Ha ha! I know. I have to swim with the dolphins from here. Thank you, Barbie. Thank you all for everything you've done. We're gonna miss you! Bye! Good luck! Swim fast, Isla. You can do this! Goodbye. Huh? A mermaid? Is that for real? But I-I thought they didn't exist. Forget the dolphins, Hugo. I want that mermaid. You got it. Scatter! Oh no, they're after Isla now. I need to help her. Where'd she go? There she is! We've got her now. Is your net-launcher ready, Hugo? Primed and ready. Perfect. I've got little miss mermaid right in my sight! Yes, I got her! No! Oh no! Oh no! I hope you know you're going to make me a lot of money. Oh, hi, Marlo. What? This... this can't be! I hate to break it to you, but I don't think anyone will pay to see me as a mermaid. There was a real mermaid. I saw it. You saw it, too. Right, Hugo? Right? I'm not sure what I saw. But what I do know is that I came out here for nothing! Good riddance, Marlo. Oh, don't worry, Marlo. I'm sure you'll find a new career after they take away your research center. A real marine biologist wants to help animals, not just use them to get rich. No! Hey, there's Isla! Whoo-woo, you made it! Goodbye, Isla! Goodbye! I'll never forget you! Thanks! Nice work, Chels. Don't forget this. Castle Malibu, fit for a queen. She'd better be tiny! Whoo-hoo! Coming through! Awesome! Hey, Barbie, my photo blog won first place. That's great, Skip. Did you submit all the photos from our trip? All but this one. It's not our secret to tell. And besides, this is the best shot of the trip. It sure is. I wonder how Isla is doing. You should go and try that shell again. Yeah. You never know. Maybe someday. I miss you, Isla. Then it's a good thing I followed that current. Isla! You found us! Well, I probably wouldn't have if you didn't keep trying. But every time you did, I was able to get closer. Thanks for not giving up on me. I would never give up on my sister of the sea. It's Isla! Awesome! We missed you! Hi again!
