25.000 English-SDH The Land Before Time XIV Journey of the Brave (2016) NARRATOR: Long, long ago, in the Land Before Time, great beasts ruled the world. These mighty beasts were the dinosaurs. Yes, it was a place of wonder, but also filled with danger... (ROARS) ...where survival was uncertain and families were sometimes torn apart. (CROAKS) Which is how the young Longneck named Littlefoot came to live with his grandmother, grandfather, and his close friends in the beautiful Great Valley. The perils of the world had claimed his mother and separated him from his father. Then, a miraculous day came. Littlefoot and his father, Bron, were reunited. During the time they were apart, Bron had become the leader of a large migrating herd. This meant he couldn't stay with Littlefoot in the Great Valley. Bron wanted his son to join him, and Littlefoot wanted to be with his father, but he also didn't want to leave his home. So Littlefoot made the tough decision to stay with his grandfather, grandmother and friends. Now each year, when the Season of New Growth follows the Cold Time, and the warm sunshine falls softly on the Great Valley, Littlefoot looks forward to a visit from his father, leading the great herd on their yearly migration. It's a reunion he dreams about all year long. And it will be happening today. (GASPS) Today's the day! (GROWLS) (ROARING) (RUBY GIGGLING) (GIGGLING) You can't find me!

DUCKY: Today is the day! CERA: Hey, hey LITTLEFOOT: Today's the day ALL: Today's the day! (SPIKE SIGHS) (ALL LAUGH) (CRACKING) (GASPING) The eggs. (CRACKING) Ohh! (CHIRPING) (CHUCKLES) Hello, little guy. Hey. (LAUGHING) He got you, Petrie! He sure do. (ALL LAUGH) (CHIRPING) So cute. I am Ducky, your sister. (CHIRPING) And this is Spike, your adopteded brother. (MOANS PLEASANTLY) And me Petrie, your adopteded brother's... Uh... Me just Petrie. (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) (CHIRPING) (LOUD FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Grandpa! Grandma! Look, it's the hatchlings! (MOANS) Ah. What a special today this is. Today! I forgot. Today's the day my dad comes back! Great! Special day! We are so happy for you, yes, we are. Can we go watch for him? (LAUGHS) I thought you might want to. Come, Littlefoot. Now, Grandpa, keep an eye on the ice. It's still slippery. We will, Grandma. Come on. We're lucky to live in such bounty, Littlefoot. Not many of our kind do. There they are! My dad's herd! You're right, Littlefoot. But where's my dad? I don't see him. That is strange. Bron is always at the head of the herd. I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. WILD ARMS: Help! Help! Help! Who's that? We'd better take a look. (SCREAMING) Help! Oh, I'm safe. Am I really here? Somebody pinch me, please. No! Not you! No. Not you. (LAUGHS) I'll pinch myself. Ow! Ouch. Why did I do that? And you are? I, uh... Well, everybody calls me Wild Arms, though I never really figured out why. Oh. (LAUGHS) That makes so much sense now! What happened, Wild Arms? Aw, I mean what didn't happen? The earth shook and spit liquid fire. And the heat... Like you've never seen before! But, it's too upsetting to talk about. But if you must know, it all started with a horrible boom! The Fire Mountain exploded. It just blew its top. Fire everywhere you looked. There was no escape. And the Longnecks, oh, they were hit the hardest. Let me tell you, their leader was brave. He wouldn't leave any of us behind, even though he was in danger. I only escaped thanks to my superior grace and agility. The leader is my dad. Who? Bron. Oh, yes, yes, that's him! Bron! What a brave Longneck he was. Ooh. Er... Is. Uh, is! 'Cause he's still is... He still is... I'm sure. What happened to him? I don't know. I lost sight of him at the Fire Mountain. He's in trouble? Grandpa, we have to help him. Littlefoot... Will you take us back there? You know the way. So, you want me to take you across the earthbreak, through the Land of the Feather-Head Sharptooth, along the moving water back to the same Fire Mountain that I just escaped from? How foolish do you think I look? Let me put it another way. The answer is no! Please. That's my dad. He needs our help. He's right, Littlefoot. We can't do it. But... You'll go, won't you? I'm sorry, Littlefoot. It's too dangerous now. We must wait for the mountain to stop spitting rocks. Bron wouldn't want us to get hurt. But my dad needs us now! Your father is very strong and wise. He's lived through many earthshakes. I'm sure he's on his way here right now. Where are you, Dad? CERA: There you are. We couldn't find you anywhere. We all worry about you. We are sorry about your father. Yes, we are. Yes, we sorry. Thanks. I think he's in trouble. He needs me. What can you do? I'm going to the Fire Mountain. I'm going to help him. (LAUGHING) Oh, that funny, Petrie thought you say you going to Fire Mountain. I... I did say that. I'm going. No seem funny now. What are you talking about? You don't even know how to get there. Wild Arms said how. Across the earthbreak, through the Land of the Feather-Head Sharpteeth and along the moving water to the Fire Mountain. If you think we're going to the Fire Mountain... I don't. He's my father. I'm going alone. (SQUAWKING) (GASPS) (ROARING IN DISTANCE) (TWIG SNAPS) (RUSTLING) (GASPS) (PANTING) (GASPS) Guys? (ALL GASP) PETRIE: Oh! Littlefoot, you scare us. You scared me. What are you doing out here? You cannot find your dad all by yourself. You cannot. Littlefoot need us. (MOANS) Uh-uh. It's too dangerous. I can't let you come. You can't stop us. (LITTLEFOOT GASPS) Oh, looking down make Petrie dizzy. (THUD) (ROARING IN DISTANCE) (NERVOUSLY) What do we do now? Wild Arms said we have to cross the earthbreak. Did he say how? No. We don't have to go across! We can follow it to the Long Valley. (WIND HOWLING) That will bring us to the Fire Mountain. Well, even if the Long Valley does go there, that will take longer. We've gotta cross now! (SCOFFS) Let me know when you find a way. LITTLEFOOT: I know! If we can knock this tree down, we can use it to cross. Hmm. (STRAINING) (TREE TRUNK CREAKING) (STRAINING CONTINUES) (GROANS) I know it will reach if we could just... (STRAINING) CERA: Look out! (GASPS) (THUDS) (GRUNTS) (TREE CREAKING) Yeah! (ALL CHEERING) Cera did it! (CLAPPING) Yes, she did! Thanks, Ducky. Well, if we're gonna go, let's go! DUCKY: Now what? I guess we go there. But that's the Land of the Feather-Head Sharpteeth. It look scary. It will be okay. Everything looks scary to you. My nest not scary. My... My tree not scary. (DISTANT ROARING) (GULPS) That scary. We'll never make it through! The Sharpteeth will smell us coming. I think we should go back and try the Long Valley. Petrie like any way that's not that way. But this way's the fastest. If we go around, we may be too late to help my dad. If we get eaten, we won't help him either. What do you think, Spike? Spike? (WIND HOWLING) CERA: Where's Spike? Oh! Sharptooth ate Spike! I think Spike is doing the eating. (YELLING) Spike! Spike? He can't have gone far. Where are you? Spike? Do you see him, Petrie? No. Spike! (GASPS) Looks like he went this way. (FLIES BUZZING) Ew! Ugh. Petrie smell something not good. That's stinkweed. Yep, yep, yep. (SPIKE CHOMPING) (CHUCKLES) LITTLEFOOT: There you are. Spike, we don't have time for this. My dad needs me. No more food stops. Okay? Why did you eat stinkweed, of all things? Ducky... (BURPS) (SINGING) Spike, you are my friend My very special friend (MOANS) And we all like you very much We know that you are happy when you fill up your tummy But what you are eating now is not so yummy (MOANS) No, no, no! It is hot and stinky Stinky and hot It may feel good inside your hungry spot But when you are eating things that taste all mucky You will be smelling very yuck-yuck-yucky So you should not eat what is hot And stinky (SNIFFS) Wait a minute. Spike, you just gave me an idea! (GRUNTS) Maybe there's a way to go through the Sharptooth Land and be safe. That's impossible! But what if we cover our smell with stinkweed? They'll smell that instead of us! You sure it work? Would you go near Spike, smelling like that? Petrie would not go near Petrie smelling like that! Let's see if this will work I think this plan can work Yeah, because you're always right (SCOFFS) If we're not lucky and a Sharptooth meets us He think we stinkweed and won't want to eats us Because we ALL: Hot and stinky Stinky and hot We'll walk right past him and we won't get caught He will not see us with his big red eyes-es 'Cause we be wearing gooey green disguises No, he will not If we be hot ALL: And stinky Your turn. ALL: You've got to got to be Hot and stinky Stinky and hot You can all be goofy, but I will not But that nasty Sharptooth will smell you if you let it I don't like stinkweed and I say forget it BOTH: No, you cannot ALL: You've got to, got to, got to Got to, got to, got to, got to be Hot and stinky Hey, stop that! ALL: Hot and stinky Ew! ALL: Hot and stinky Stinky and hot Now we all stinky and hot (LAUGHING) (BURPS) (GROANS) Okay, everybody, stay together. Here we go. CERA: I hope you know what you're doing. LITTLEFOOT: Me, too. (GASPS) (ROARING) (WHISPERS) Get back, everyone. (FOOTSTEPS POUNDING) (ROARING) (GROWLING) (ROARING) (SOFTLY) Seems like the stinkweed's working. Quiet, now. Yes, Petrie be very quiet, quieter than quiet, so quiet nobody hear me. (GROWLING) Petrie. What? Oh, yes. Quiet. (SNIFFING) (GASPS) (SQUEAKING) (SCREAMS) (GROWLING) (ROARING) How much further, Littlefoot? I don't know! It's hot. And I'm stinky! I don't like being hot and stinky! No one likes that. No, no, no. Look! Water! (ALL EXCLAIM) CERA: Yeah! DUCKY: Water! (ALL LAUGHING) (EXCLAIMS) Um, guys, maybe we should go soon. I'm not ready. My belly's only half full, which means it's half empty. (GROANS) (MOANS) Spike. No eating the stinkweed. We need to keep stinking. (STRUGGLING) Spike, let go. Ahhh! (SPLASHING) (CHUCKLES) Littlefoot go for swim. I want to swim. No, Cera! Me, too. (BOTH GIGGLE) (LAUGHING) (SNIFFING) (ROARS) (SNIFFS) (ROARS) (GIGGLING) Um, guys, the stinkweed... Stinkweed! It's washing off! (ROARING) (SHUDDERS) (ROARS) (BOTH SNIFFING) (SHIVERING) (GROWLING) (ALL GASPING) (GROANS) (GROWLING) Run! (ROARS) Come on! Come on! Whoa! (ALL PANTING) (ROARING) (ROARING) (ALL WHIMPERING) (ALL SCREAMING) (CRASHING) (GROWLING) (ROARING) (STRAINING) (ROARING) (ALL SCREAMING) (CRASHING) ALL: Whoa! This way! (ALL STRAINING) Come on! Come on! (STRAINING CONTINUES) ALL: Whoa! (ALL GASP) We're trapped! We should have gone my way! Cera, I'm trying to think. (HUFFS) LITTLEFOOT: Hey! You all get behind those rocks. Spike, Cera, grab each end of that vine. When I tell you, pull it tight. Okay? ALL: Mmm-hmm. Here it come! (ROARING) Oh, no! This it! (GULPS) (GROWLS) (ROARS) Over here, big guy. Right here. (ROARING) Now! (GROANING) (GROANING CONTINUES) (ROARS) (ALL CHEERING) (ROARING) (ROARS) (ALL GASP) DUCKY: The other one is coming! Let him come. (STRAINING) (CRASHING) (GROANING) (ALL CHEERING) (GROANS) CERA: Bye-bye! (SIGHS) We are all in one piece. (CHUCKLES) Better than million little pieces. (RUMBLING) It's the Fire Mountain, like Wild Arms said. We just have to reach the moving water and we'll be fine. Fine? What do you mean, fine? We are nowhere near fine. (GROANS) Huh? (GASPS) DUCKY: Look, guys. Spike found a way down. LITTLEFOOT: Thanks, Spike! (HOWLING) Well, hello there, Ruby and Chomper. What can we do for you? Is Littlefoot here? Did you look at Cera's? We've looked for him everywhere, and everywhere we've looked, he isn't. I don't like the sound of this. (ROARING IN DISTANCE) (WHINING) (EXHALES) Petrie glad we leaving Land of Feather-Head Sharpteeth. Until we have to go back home. Oh. Petrie stomach feel funny again. (YAWNS) (THUDS) (SNORING) (SNORING CONTINUES) Come on, Spike. We have to keep going. Spike is tired-ed, Littlefoot. Ducky, can you help move him? (SNORING CONTINUES) Okay, Spike, let's keep going. (STRAINING) (YAWNS) (SNORING RESUMES) (YAWNS) Ducky. (YAWNS) Nothing makes me tired like almost getting eaten by Sharpteeth. (YAWNS) (YAWNS) Petrie so sorry. We find your dad tomorrow. (ALL SNORING) Littlefoot isn't here, and Cera should be home by now, too. I haven't seen Petrie either. Oh, dear. I assumed Spike and Ducky were still out playing. I suspect the young ones have gone looking for Littlefoot's father. Cera, too? (STOMPS) What was she thinking? We have to find them right away. I saw Littlefoot listening closely to what Wild Arms said. I would guess he went the way he described. Thankfully, there's some light from the night circle. We'll leave now. I'll ask Wild Arms to guide us. (SOFTLY) We should go, too! (SOFTLY) Yes, but let's not let them know we're going, too. (WIND HOWLING) (ROARING IN DISTANCE) (SHUDDERS) (WHIMPERING) (ROARING CONTINUES) Okay, guys. Ah... (CHUCKLES) I'm sure you can find the Fire Mountain without me. I mean I'd love to come, but, uh, I got a thing to do, and it's called "live." We need all the help we can get, Wild Arms, with these little ones out here all by themselves. Of all the wild stunts these young ones have pulled, this is the worst. We'll find them, Mr. Threehorn. We've got to. (ALL SNORING) (SIGHS) Through there is the Land of the Feather-Head Sharpteeth. Right, Mr. Wild Arms? You mean the land of certain death? Yes, that is it. Okay? Or we can just be sensible and go back now. I vote sensible. Who's with me? I mean, come on. How do we even know if the little ones came this way? Well, what do you think, Chomper? Chomper? I believe we have some followers. Chomper? Ruby? CHOMPER: I don't know what you mean. We're not here. It's okay. Come on out. Hello, everybody, everybody, hello. Hi. (SCREAMS) Sharptooth! Run! Save yourself! (SHUDDERING) (CHUCKLES) No need for panic, Mr. Wild Arms. Chomper here is a friend. Uh, have you taken a good look at his teeth? (CHUCKLES) It's all right, Mr. Wild Arms. Chomper only eats bugs. We don't need another Sharptooth when we're walking into a whole land of Sharpteeth. Oh, finally someone who's sensible! Up top! Okay. Four more eyes are four more chances to find them. Please? (SIGHS) Well, guess we can't just send you two back on your own. BOTH: Yay! (BOTH CHEERING) Hey, Mr. Wild Arms. (EXHALES) (LAUGHS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Would you mind, Mr. Threehorn? I knew I'd end up carrying him sooner or later. (WILD ARMS GROANING) Chomper, can you smell if Littlefoot and the others went this way? Uh-huh. (SNIFFING) Littlefoot. Cera. I smell them all. Come on, through here. (SNIFFING) CERA: You said we'd find the moving water by now. It should be around the bend. That's what you said two bends ago! (STOMACH GROWLING) (GASPS) Sharpteeth! Do not worry, Petrie, that is just Spike's belly. Oh. (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) We're all hungry! And thirsty! I have an idea. I'm going to go up there and look around. You all wait here. Hmm. LITTLEFOOT: I see it! The Fire Mountain. And there, the moving water leads right to it. But how come we can't find it? (GASPS) Can I see, Littlefoot? Um, uh... (GASPS) Spike? I don't know if you should come up here. Oh! Petrie want to see, too. CERA: Hey, wait for me. Um... I think this ledge is too small to hold all of us. I want to see for myself. Cera... (SIGHS) We're nowhere near the moving water. It should be around... "Around the bend." I don't think you know where we're going. We should have gone my way! (THUDDING) (ALL GASP) (CRACKING) Oops. (ALL SCREAMING) (ALL GRUNTING) (MUFFLED STRAINING) (GROANS) (GASPS) (GRUNTING) Nice going, Littlefoot! Me? I told you not to come up there! None of this would have happened if we went through the Long Valley, like I said. If we went on instead of stopping last night I'd be with my dad! You wouldn't be anywhere without me. You? You're just slowing me down. You all are. (ALL GASPING) I'd be better off alone. You want to be alone, that's fine! Fine! I'm gonna find the Long Valley. I know where that will lead. You coming with me? (GROANS SADLY) Good. We're better off without him. (SINGING) Who needs friends to slow you down Wasting our time with too much talking Who needs friends to grumble and frown (SQUEAKING) When we should just keep walking I'm just fine On my own (GASPS) I will be better off alone Who needs friends who get you lost And don't wanna listen when you tell them That you know the best way to go And you're just trying to help them Might as well Talk to this stone Ow! I'm sure I'm better off alone And who needs friends Who needs friends To boss me around To boss me around BOTH: That's really hard to swallow Can't she see? Can't he see? It's so clear to me It's so clear to me BOTH: I should lead... And she should follow? And he should follow? BOTH: My mistake I should have known I would be better off alone I'm sure I'm better off alone We're so much better off alone I guess I'm better off alone (WIND WHOOSHING) Huh? It's too soon to be dark. (GASPS) Oh, no! Sand cloud! Cera? Guys? (GROANS) Petrie feel bad. (MOANS IN AGREEMENT) Spike, too. Me, three. I miss Littlefoot. (WIND WHOOSHING) Petrie hate wind! (YELLS) (GASPS) Petrie! Help! Hurry, Spike. Hurry. (GASPS) Guys? (GASPING) Sand cloud! (GASPS) ETTA: Don't tell me you're thinking about going back out there. That's a sand cloud, case you didn't notice. My friends are out there! Well, then you'd best hope they find some shelter like you. You don't understand. They're only out here because of me. Well, getting yourself killed is not a way I ever heard of showing you care. Nothing you can do but wait out the storm. (GROWLING) Mmm. Nope, not dead. You still got time to grow up and learn to listen. (SIGHS) (GROANS) (LEAVES RUSTLING) (GRUNTING) (SPLUTTERING) Ducky? Spike? Petrie? (GASPS) Who's there? (BOTH GASPING) (BOTH SIGHING) (SIGHS) Spike. What are you doing sneaking up on me? Where's Ducky? (BOTH GASPING) (SPLUTTERING) Here I am. Good. What about Petrie? The wind tooked him away. Oh, great! I guess we'll have to look for him. What about Littlefoot? He's probably far off by now. I'll bet he missed the storm. I do not know. Well, I do. Let's go find Petrie. The storm covereded everything with sand. Which way? (MOANS IN AGREEMENT) Um, that way. I do not think that's right. No, no, no. Well, I say it is. Come on. Petrie! Petrie! Where is he? (SHIVERING) Ducky? Spike? Anybody? (SHOUTING) Anybody at all? (GASPS) (WHIMPERS) Littlefoot! Cera! (SCREAMING) Help! (WHIMPERS) Nice diggers. Nice diggers. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) (WHIMPERS) (WHIMPERS) No! (GRUNTS) No eat Petrie! ALL: More. (GULPING) More? ALL: More. More? ALL: More. More. More. (ALL CHEERING) Hello. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Me Petrie. ALL: Petrie! Petrie! Petrie! Whatcha doin', hon? I'm gonna go help my friends. Aren't you nice. You know, I had a cousin who was nice like that. She put her head in the mouth of a Sharptooth just to help a friend. Course, she's not around anymore, 'cause... Well, she put her head in the mouth of a Sharptooth. (LAUGHS) Oh! I'm Etta, by the way. What's your name? Littlefoot. Sorry. Nice to meet you, Fiddlefoot. You don't mind me saying, you look more like a Littlefoot. That's what I'm gonna call you. Nice to meet you, Etta. Look, Etta! Daylight! (RUMBLING) What? Earthshake! Whoa! Etta! (CRASHING) (BOTH GASP) (SIGHS) That was a close one. The opening. We gotta move this. (BOTH STRAINING) Looks like we're good and stuck. (SIGHS) CERA: Petrie! Petrie! (MOANS) Hmm. Are you sure this is the right way? Look! Footprints! Now we're getting somewhere! Hmm. But that's Spike's footprint. And yours. Oh, you just led us in a circle. Oh. Well, maybe I meant to do that. (GASPS) (STUTTERING) What's going on? Hey! Get away! Big dinner for leader! (GASPS) Get leader! ALL: Leader! Leader! Leader! (STAMMERING) I'm not afraid of your silly old leader. Here come leader! (BOTH GASP) Petrie! We found you! Huh? (MOANS EXCITEDLY) (SIGHING) Petrie so glad to see you. You? You can't be their leader! ALL: (CHANTING) Petrie! Petrie! Petrie! (CHUCKLES) Me think me can. You don't even know how to be a leader. Oh, it no hard. Watch. ALL: (CHANTING) Leader! Leader! Leader! Huh? I wish Littlefoot could see this. No find yet? (MOANS SADLY) He's probably at the Fire Mountain by now. (GRUNTING) (SIGHS) We should find the Long Valley. What do you think we should do? I just told you. I mean Petrie. Who cares what Petrie thinks? ALL: (CHANTING) Petrie! Petrie! Petrie! They care. Well? Petrie think... Well, Petrie think, um... We're waiting! Uh, being leader hard. (SIGHS) But Petrie miss Littlefoot. (MOANS IN AGREEMENT) Us, too. Yep, yep, yep. Well, how are you supposed to find him? We don't even know where we are! So we are lost. (GULPS) No, no, we're not. I mean, not really. Okay, we are lost. And I miss him, too. Let's go find him. Petrie must go and find friend. ALL: No! No! No! No be sad. Um... Petrie order no be sad. Petrie always remember you. And you. And back there, all you. ALL: Petrie! Petrie! Petrie! (RUSTLING) ALL: Oh! (LAUGHING) Leader! Leader! Leader! (CHEERING) Yay! (SPIKE GROANS) (LITTLEFOOT GRUNTING) Littlefoot, leave it be. Honey, no one can break through that. Cera could. But she's not here. (SIGHS) It's hopeless. Come on, Littlefoot, cheer up. I had a sister once used to say, "Just when things get darkest," "that's when you look for the light." Unless, of course, it's too dark to find it. You don't understand. My friends only came out here to help me find my dad. And now I can't save him. Well, what... What happened to your dad? He got trapped by an earthshake when the Fire Mountain blew up. That's what Wild Arms said. Wild Arms? Oh, heck, I know a Wild Arms. Moves like this? Yes, that's him! He travels with my dad's herd. They all made it out okay, except my dad. Oh, my. Is your father's name Bron? Yeah, it is! Oh, honey, I was there, at Fire Mountain. What happened? Please tell me. Okay. But you may not like it. The Fire Mountain was shaking and rumbling. Trouble was coming and everybody knew it. There was only one longneck who knew what to do and that was your dad. He ordered the herd to head down the mountain as fast as they could. But the Fire Mountain didn't wait for them to get down. (EXPLODING) Ow! I barely made it out myself. Someone fell. I think it was Wild Arms. Your father went back and saved him. And that's when it happened. There was an explosion. Your father got separated from the others. Well, honey, that's the last I saw of him. That's my dad. He wouldn't leave anyone behind. Even though it meant risking his life. I guess that's what you do for your herd. And your friends. I never should have left them. Now, Littlefoot, don't give up. Get off your tail and we're gonna get out of this cave. How? (SINGING) When you're stuck in a hole and you don't know where to go When it's too dark for you to tell Your tail from your toe You wonder which way is wrong And which road is right? The best thing for you to do is just Look for the light Look for the light One little spark A little bit of hope to lead you out of the dark Somewhere deep inside of you, it's shining so bright All you gotta do is look You gotta look for the light If there's a wall, sometimes you bump it A big old rock, you have to jump it Maybe you're tired Maybe you're scared (GASPS) But the only thing you have to be Is be prepared To look for the light And open your eyes You never know when you're gonna find a surprise Some things may tickle you (GIGGLING) Others may bite So, listen to my sister, mister Come on and look for the light Get up and look for the light Get up and look for the light Come on and look for the light Well, that's what my sister used to say, but you can't exactly go by her. She ran into a tree once and been a little funny in the head ever since. Hey, Etta! Maybe that's a way out! (SIGHS) It's just light shining off the water. Oh, I'm sorry, Littlefoot. (SIGHS) That's okay. Let's keep looking for the light. That's the spirit! It's water, Etta! Heard ya the first time, but we're looking for a way out. Like I was saying about my sister... Etta, if water's coming in the cave, you know what that means? It's wet? No. It means it has to be going out, too! If it wasn't, the cave would be filled with water. Oh, I didn't think of that. If water can find a way out, maybe we can, too! I like the way you think, Littlefoot! She had a lot of sayings, my sister. Like... You know, "Don't use your tail to sniff the trail." (LAUGHING) Oh, that got me every time. (MUMBLING) Littlefoot! Littlefoot! Littlefoot! Littlefoot! (MOANS EXCITEDLY) Hmm! Oh! Look! Littlefoot's footprints! He must be close, yes, yes, yes! Nice going, Spike! That was hard to see with all these Sharptooth footprints around. Sharptooth? (GROWLING) (ALL GASPING) (ROARING) (SCREAMING) CERA: This way! (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) (SHUDDERING) (GROWLING) (ROARING) (GASPS) Look, Etta. It's the moving water! My friends and I were looking for it. Oh, my. It's under the ground! That's why we couldn't find it before. I bet if we follow this water, it will lead right to the Fire Mountain. Now all we have to do is find my friends. Hmm. But how? They could be anywhere. (INDISTINCT VOICES) That's funny. It's like I can hear them. (INDISTINCT VOICES) Etta, can you get up there? Hmm. My wing got a little singed. But I can try. (HUMMING) Hmm. Now what? Poke through! Okay. (THUDDING) (SHUDDERING) ETTA: Yoo-hoo. (ALL SCREAMING) (LAUGHS) Sorry to startle you, but I wonder if I can have just a moment of your time. Are you by any chance friends with Littlefoot? We are! He says you should come with me. What's a Bigbeak doing underground? Well, that's an interesting story and I'd love to tell all of you that. But first, maybe we should get you away from that Sharptooth. (GROWLING) Honey, would you mind giving that rock just a little shove? You got it! (STRAINING) Go! (ROARING) (ALL SCREAMING) Whoa! (STRAINING) (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) (SIGHS) Littlefoot! Hi, everyone! Oh, Petrie miss you! Spike and me, too! (SOFT CHUCKLE) I'm so happy we're all together. I... I should have never left you. Yeah, well, maybe we all shouldn't have left. I'm sorry, Littlefoot. Me, too. Etta, these are my friends. (LAUGHS) I can sure see that! Hey, look what me and Etta found. It's the moving water! It went under the ground. That's why we couldn't find it before. I think this will take us right to the Fire Mountain. I mean... If you still want to go with me. I will go with you, Littlefoot. (MOANS IN AGREEMENT) Petrie, too. Hey, hey, hey! Count me in. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! Jump! Whoo-hoo! (LAUGHS) The water's great! (SCREAMS) (YELLS) (LAUGHING) Look out below! ALL: Ooh! Ah! (SCREAMS) (LAUGHING) (ALL EXCLAIMING) (ALL GIGGLING) Look! Light! We're coming out! Petrie see only sky. (GASPS) CERA: Oh, what does that mean? (GASPS) Falling water! (ALL SCREAMING) (ALL LAUGHING) Whoa! (LAUGHING) (GIGGLING) Ooh! That was the best! (GIGGLING) I want to do that again! (MOANS IN AGREEMENT) Anybody know where we are? ETTA: Yep. I'm afraid I do. (ALL GASP) (EXHALES) Petrie like the water more. What now? Etta, where did you say you saw my dad? Just over that ridge, that's where your father fell. Littlefoot, you might not like what you see. (GASPS) Littlefoot? (GASPS) Dad! Littlefoot? (ALL PANTING) (STUTTERING) What are you doing here? We came to get you. Thank you, all of you. But my leg is stuck. There's nothing you can do. (SNIFFING) They came this way. (SNIFFING) (SNIFFING) Sharptooth! (SCREAMS) (YELLING) Sharptooth! Nobody make a sound! Everybody needs to be very, very... (SOFTLY) Quiet, Wild Arms. (ROARING) This way. (SHUDDERING) (WHIMPERS) (WHIMPERING) I wanna go home. (SHUSHING) Oh, no... Why... (ROARS) He's gone. (SHIVERING) You hear that? He's gone! (CLEARS THROAT) He's gone. Isn't that great? There has to be something we can do! (WHIMPERS) Me so sorry. Etta, please take them home. I am not going! (EXPLODES) (ALL GASPING) Littlefoot, your dad's right. You didn't give up on your herd. I'm not giving up on you! We want to help, too. ETTA: Uh-huh! (MOANS IN AGREEMENT) Cera, do you think you can move that big rock? That one? It's huge! I know. But you can do it. Look out, I'm coming through! Guys, Etta, we're going to need a tree. Get that one. ETTA: Okay. SPIKE: Mmm-hmm! What can Petrie do? Go up high. Let us know when the flowing fire starts coming for us. Petrie will! Huh? Hang on! (GRUNTING) (GASPS) (GROWLING) (STRAINING) Cera, you can do it! Get ready! You're going down! (STRAINING) Yeah! Whoa! (GASPS) Yeah! Dad. Littlefoot. (BOTH STRAINING) Okay, put the end in here! (STRAINING) Everyone get ready! When I say, "Push down!" Hurry! Ready, set, push! (ALL STRAINING) (GRUNTING) (ALL STRAINING) Dad, now! Hey! Petrie think you should hurry! Go! Go! Go! (ALL GASPING) (BRON GRUNTS) (ALL CHEERING) MR. THREEHORN: Cera! Dad! (GIGGLING) Thank goodness. (MOANING HAPPILY) What are you doing way out here? We came to save you. Oh, we thank you but no need saving. This time we do saving. ETTA: Wild Arms! What are you doing back here? Well, Etta, I volunteered to lead the rescue. That's what I'm doing here. (CHUCKLES) You volunteered? Really? Well, uh... (CHUCKLES) Yeah? (LAUGHING) Grandpa! I see you found your father. He did. We all did. (ALL AGREEING) You've got quite a group of friends. You remind me of someone I know. Come, everyone. Let's all go home. Finally someone who's sensible! Let's get out of here. (LAUGHING) NARRATOR: Littlefoot had found his father. And he found something else, too. Something he wasn't looking for. The realization that he and his friends would always be together till the end of their days in the Land Before Time. subrip from NTSC-6.01GB-23.976 ? 09-09-2016 synch 25.000 ? 13-09-2016 (ALL LAUGHING) PETRIE: Ooh, you'll be very stinky.
