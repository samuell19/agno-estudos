'tis the season for holiday crafts that will blow your mind. Four teams will bring their own crafty secrets... Whoo, child. ...To battle it out over three rounds. nailed it. They'll need to wow the judges... Um, genius. I don't like it. ...And out-craft their competition... What just happened? What just happened? ...For the grand prize of $10,000... Oh, my god. Wow. ...And the title of ultimate holiday crafting champion. This is "holiday crafters gone wild." Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! what's going on? I see sparkle. hey, guys! oh, my god! So, out of the blue, the floor is literally moving. Here comes... Jay! hello! Hi! I love it. welcome to the workshop, crafters. yay! I love this energy! I'm jay Manuel, and I'll be leading you through our winter wonderland. You'll be battling it out over three rounds of competition to see which of you will be going home with their stocking stuffed with $10,000 and the ultimate "holiday crafters gone wild" trophy. each round, we'll start with a quick craft. The winning team will win an advantage going into the main challenge, or what we like to call a colossal craft. And if you don't wow the judges, you'll be put on santa's naughty list and sent packing, and that's not cute. you'll have access to the crafting shelves, a pantry stocked with everything that you clever little crafters will ever need. But who will take home the $10,000 prize? That will be up to our judges. Interior designer and hgtv star, Kim Myles. looking gorgeous. Festive as always. I brought my outfit like you did, jay. and holiday crafting expert and event planner to the stars, Mikie Russo. you look festive. Like, you're doing the Christmas tree. I'm the tinsel. Yes, I'm the tree topper. You're the tree topper. for the first quick craft, you'll have one hour to create the ultimate centerpiece... ...For a holiday table fit for the big man himself, Mr. Santa Claus. We're going to be looking at your overall concept and creativity, and of course, craftsman or craft-womanship. Okay, my little holiday elves, your one hour starts... now! Now! Now! So, what things make you think of the holidays? Family, winter. Oh, this is good. Good, good, good. Okay, okay. Okay, and I saw some pine cones. We need to bring in some of ... just the woodworking stuff that we kind of do, but we have to, like, elevate it, right? For our centerpiece, we're gonna make some modern lanterns that are really sleek and natural-looking, but have a really fun pop of color. Inside the lanterns, we're going to bring in some really modern Christmas trees ... just basic triangles. I think that's gonna work for this. I'm already stressed out and I'm only painting. Listen, you need to do a little zen breathing before you get behind a saw, my friend. we're good. Okay. We're good. After painting as many pieces of wood as possible, I run outside to the miter saw to cut some of the trees. I want to hydro dip some of these plywood trees that we're gonna put inside the lanterns. It's literally spray paint and water. It's gonna look sort of like marbling with paint, but in half the time. I do a little chh-chh-chh-chh-chh. I dunk the first one, and it looks amazing. She "sleighed" it. okay, so, if we were talking about my family and holiday ... it's like cha... chaos. It's chaos. So, we want to go big, big scale and make a huge funnel cloud. I'm gonna take a foam batting, and I want to put flashing lights inside of the foam. Bringing in the floor element, I'm going to use petals to create raindrops on a fish line, as if the storm is getting bigger and bigger. Can we get a motor and put it on? I will ... make it spin. I'll work on that. I'll work on that. We don't speak basic. When you come to us for a wedding, we're going to elevate, we're going to activate, and we're going to blow that spot up. We create experiences. That's our whole thing ... the experience from the beginning all the way to the end ... and that's what people remember. Right. I'm gonna flip it. Gonna cut it. Here we go. I want to put these lights in it. Duh. We want to try to create lightning, wind... Rain. ...And rain. Creating a storm, but in a stylized fashion. Look at these look at these. So good. So good. We are making a rustic, authentic centerpiece for this fantasy dinner party for Santa. Our centerpiece will include tree branches that we fuse together, doves, Spanish moss, pine cones, lots of glitter. You do that one. I'll do this one. Yep. This is going to be about three feet tall, so we have a lot of branches. And didn't read wintry, necessarily, so we felt, "you know, we should paint these." do it kind of thin, so you don't want it to look opaque. You don't want it to look okay. You want to see some natural tones of the wood. Okay. Let's do this. We gotta think of, like ... things that we are good at. Magic. Magic. Mario is a magician, and I am his manager/wife/co-adventurer. We spend most of our lives traveling, doing theater shows, and trying to inspire the next generation of kids. Everything that Mario uses in his magic show, it's all made out of cardboard and crazy objects that kids can find at home, and that's the goal, is to inspire them to go home and make something. I think you could create, like, a floating element. Yeah, the science ... that levitating tension. We are creating a floating pedestal where the top looks disconnected from the bottom. It's embellished with paper flowers and boxes that are designed in a pop art, 2d way. Okay, so, then, I have to cut wood. You cut wood, I'll cut leaves. Okay. I have to cut certain pieces of wood at, like, the precise angle for it to work. I'm making calculations in my mind. You know what I say? You measure twice and you guess. what? Meanwhile, I am cutting 30 paper leaves, outline each of the leaves with black on both sides. And, ideally, this will look kind of like an illustration come to life. All right, don't get your tinsel in a tangle, but there's only 30 minutes left. Oh, my gosh. okay, okay, okay, okay. This is nerve-wracking. We gotta get the tension of the strings perfectly perfectly in order for it to stay balanced so we can put stuff on it. Okay, good. One main string in the center is what holds the table together. So, let's see if it floats right now. There's no "plan b." if we don't get this up, we are doomed, basically. We're doomed. All right, does that look level to you? Oh, is it working? Yes! oh, that is so cool. I want you to build me one of those for my house. Thank you! It's physics. Science, science. this one. Let's hope this works. I brought a few antique flower molds. They're made of metal, and I use an iron to heat it up, and then I spray-starch some fabric, and then I use the heated metal to press these shapes into the fabric. That is so cool, Mariana. Let's hope it works. I can't wait. ho-ho-ho! But there's only 10 minutes to go! Ten minutes? Ahh! If you can glue and I nail, that'd be perfect. I run these pieces for the lantern back into the workshop, and I have to nail them into place to assemble the lanterns. You ready for me to give this a test for a second? Oh, I'm ready. Now it's time to see if it can take the turning. This is do or die, 'cause if this has a problem with the spinning, then we're gonna have to re... spin it, spin it, spin it, spin it. And it spins. Wait a minute ... yes, yes, yes. yes, yes, yes. We don't keep basic. We don't speak basic. Guerdy, Garrett, what is going on? This is a lot! That's exactly what 2020 needed, was a Christmas storm. Right. ♪ this is craaazyyy ♪ very short amount of time left, and I am lining the present boxes with 2d lines to continue that pop art style. Let's put it on top. Already? Yeah, let's get this rocking and rolling. Three minutes! Auugh! Augh! Should we just paint the edges? Yeah, let's do that. In fact, that probably would be easier than sanding. Um, glitter, glitter, glitter. That's what we need, yes. Oh, my god, Mario. Making me nervous. If it falls down now, we're ... Yeah, I gotcha. 30 seconds, teams! Ahh! Steady, steady, steady. Steady. Little flop sweat. It's almost time. It's almost time. Okay, hurry. Okay, hurry, hu... hurry, over there. 6...5...4... I'm scared I'm gonna knock it all over. No, no, no, no. ...2... Okay, step away. ...1. All right, that's it! Time's up! Good job, crafters! Ah! That was so stressful. I know. Sam and Charlotte, explain to us your concept. We wanted to combine woodworking and Charlotte's beautiful eye for color into something that still felt festive and not too harsh. I like the exposed wood counterpointed against the color, and I like the simplicity. Yes. I will say, if you do a simple craft, it needs to be polished across the board. I do notice a little bit of paint on the outside, so maybe we can just clean that up a little bit. When it's this simple, there's nothing to distract the eye from the mistakes. All right. Thanks, ladies. We'll see you guys later. Thank you. Good luck. Guerdy and Garrett ... the storm of the century. so, talk to us. What is the concept? We wanted to capture what happens at a family dinner ... chaos! Oh, very true. I do love the simplicity of the petals that you created, and I do like the lights inside. You guys went big, and there's a moving element with the turntable ... that I am concerned about my ability to have festivities across the table. The turntable feels unfinished, unloved, empty. When people are sitting at a table, they see what's directly in front of them, so it's not always what's above. Thanks, guys, so much. Good luck. Terry, Mariana! Talk to us about your concept. So, this centerpiece, the doves that you see symbolize hope, and the tree, a new beginning. All the different branches ... different branches of your family all coming together for a celebration. Ooh, you guys thought through this. Detail police ... mikie. I mean, I'm the glitter king. I love glitter. I feel like it's slightly too much. Too much?! You can never have too much glitter! I know, I know. Because I feel like it has such an ethereal, natural feel. Okay. Okay. I think the height is great, and I love that you hand-made the flowers. I love that it's the first thing I'll see when I sit. But they blend in completely because there's no color differential. So this fine handwork isn't popping and being presented because it's all monochromatic. Mm-hmm. The magician and his wife, Mario and Katie. hi. So, tell us about this concept for your centerpiece. The goal was to create something very friendly to kids that maybe they could make in kindergarten, you know? But elevate it. Oh, I like that. It does have a childlike feel to it, but it's gorgeous. I will say maybe a little more holiday. It's missing. Okay. Slightly more holiday. It comes alive, mikie. I gotta do this again. What do you think of the illusion? It's so funny. Like, I love that. So, if I made this ... when I got up from the table, I'd give it a hard nudge just to make sure everyone saw what happened. I have to say, I really like the presents. I like that they're so spare. I think the only thing that gives me a little pause is just execution. And some of it, I get the childlike vibe of, like, "it doesn't have to be 'perfect.'" I'm not looking for that. But there are little details that I'm like, "eehhh." all right, thanks, guys. We'll see you later. all right, judges, have you guys come to a decision? We have. Yes. All right, Kim, let's see. Okay, teams, it's time to find out whose centerpiece filled the judges with holiday cheer. Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! Whose centerpiece filled the judges with holiday cheer. Mario and Katie, the blue team! aww, thank you guys so much. Congrats, Mario and Katie. Not only do you have bragging rights, but you've also earned a big advantage in the next challenge. Okay. So, crafters, now that you have the perfect centerpiece, it's time to get the rest of the table ready for dinner. for your colossal craft, you'll have two hours to create an epic holiday tablescape with all the trimmings. We want to see a cohesive theme that matches your centerpiece. So, Katie and Mario, since you guys won the quick craft, you guys will get to select your table first. Okay. Whoa. That one in the corner. There's no weird shapes. It's not an oval. There's no corners cut off. It's just nice and clean and easy to work with. Okay, teams, you guys have two hours... ...And your time starts... now! ...Now! Now! Keep it clean. Okay, this is our canvas. All right, so, let's rock this. For our tablescape, we want to continue the 2d elements. 2d tablescape, 2d everything. Everything looks like its hand drawn. Painting the lines on the chairs ... And then, the outline of the tablecloth and illustrated plates. So you feel like you're sitting in a comic book. I'm just gonna outline it, and then I'll thicken the lines after. The most difficult part by far is painting the lines on the chairs. It's super time-consuming, but it's one of the most important design elements. You're rocking it, Katie. That's great. Let's create really high-end architecture in the back. I think the chairs is where we can really go designer on that. We decide to go with "stormy holiday" with a black-tie twist. So, first, there's chairs, and we know we've got to cover that and make them predominantly white. But then, with a pop of color of black, I think we'll do snow globes as well as some texturized foam to give you that snowball fight effect. Let's see what we can come up with. Maybe I'll stop here. We need the biggest table to help the scale of our centerpiece. Right, but two hours is all we got. Can we pull it off? I don't know. Right. This is no-sew seam, where you glue and you keep moving. So, right now, I'm just holding my fabric into position. So, a no-sew seam is ... you're gonna cheat. You're gonna pin it, you're gonna roll it, and you're gonna glue it. Make or break. It's an important design choice. Okay. So, they want just a little bit of color, 'cause the flowers were too close. Yes, I'm thinking either, like, blues or purples. Something like that. You know I love purple. Our theme for our table is "winter wonderland fantasy table-skate." we are making a table overlay with sparkly elements, faux fur chair covers. And I'm going to hand-paint flowers with purple paint to really pop at the base of the centerpiece. Hearing the judges' feedback that our centerpiece was too monochromatic, it was an opportunity for us to make some changes and get it right. One of the reasons we work really well together is, we have the foundation of a 12-year friendship. As a fashion school grad, I love to sew, and I bring a lot of that into my work. One of my strengths as a crafter is, I'm able to repurpose different items that we find in a garage sale or an antique shop. Can I ask your help to pin, like, the ruching? And then, I'll start sewing. Sure. While terry is working on our table overlay, I start sewing to get some dimension and some texture onto our table overlay. just have to trust the machine that it's not gonna break down on me. I wasn't expecting a round table. We're gonna make it work. Everyone grabs all the tables, and we are left with a small oval table. We have lots of square, straight lines and really crisp edges. I was just too slow. I think I'd rather focus on the runner, 'cause that's gonna be the biggest project on the table. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For the centerpiece, we did sort of a modern woodland holiday. And so, for the tablescape, we want to add to that and make it a modern evergreen holiday. We're going to start by painting a runner onto the table, and then cut a wood box with an acrylic top and lights inside to accent our centerpiece. Then, we're going to custom-hydro-dip plate chargers and seat backs, make tie-dye napkins, and to top it all off, we're going to have real pine tree seedlings for party favors. okay. This is definitely a gamble to put down a coat of paint on something that we can't undo, but I feel confident. While Charlotte is inside painting, I'm going to grab the tools, and I'm going to start cutting away at all of the wood elements that we are incorporating into this table. For me, holidays are all about handmade gifts. So I just love being a girl who can use power tools and build really cool stuff. My aesthetic is rustic and natural, and then Charlotte literally brings the color into my life. One of my favorite things to do is to find really simple, accessible items, and then transform them into something that makes them unrecognizable. She's pretty much a creative genius. All right. Try this. We are in "get-weird" mode. You know, we just want to keep our chaos theme, but we can now show off how we can refine. I'm hot-gluing and spray adhesive-ing each feather down individually. There's something therapeutic about doing it ... about creating. It also could be the fumes of the spray adhesive. that's right. But it is. It makes you feel good, you know? Guys, we have an hour and a half left. Chop, chop. Let's go. What?! What?! What?! What?! That is unacceptable! All right I need to outline the last one, and then we can go back and touch them all up. All right, and then, I'm gonna break spoons and I'm gonna make a tree out of spoon heads. It's not about the object. It's about the passion you put into the object that you're holding. I love spoons ... like, plastic spoons ... and it's fun to break things, right? I have to break these spoons, like, so that we just have the spoon part and some hot glue all around till we get to the top. If you did an accent line on every single spoon, it would really create that element that it's ... sweet. Yep. You still got a lot to do, huh? Oh, terry, how are you doing? I am working on this trim around the table. I find this silvery, shimmery fabric that I thought would work out great for our tablescapes, and I start to do a tuxedo pleat. You take the fabric and make multiple pleats resembling a tuxedo shirt. I feel like he's wasting a lot of time with the fabric, and I feel like there's just a lot going on with that look. Mm-hmm. Mariana, are you showing off over there? Looking around, I realized that Mariana and terry are doing something that's pretty similar to ours, and I start to get a little nervous on that. She was sewing up like nobody's business, so we're concerned. so, the show-stopping piece for this table is going to be this runner that I'm building with wood and acrylic. And we're gonna add lights and make it glow, so this thing has to be perfect. No pressure. you know the saying, "measure twice, cut once"? Just didn't do that. Arrghh. I cut the pieces of plywood way too short on two ends, and now, the runner is not fitting together. This piece has to look literally perfect, because it is the centerpiece of the table. So if it doesn't look perfect, like, the entire vision of the table falls apart, and like, I don't want that to happen. And now, I'm freaking out a little bit. Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! you know the saying, "measure twice, cut once"? Just didn't do that. Arrghh. So, the show-stopping piece for this table is going to be this runner that I'm building. I cut the pieces of plywood way too short on two ends, and now, the runner is not fitting together. I know that doing this the right way is gonna pay off in the long run, so the best course of action here is to just suck it up and rebuild the frame. Do we have trees? Trees are over there. Why don't I quickly hydro dip ... okay. Perfect, done. We already have some trees hydro dipped for the centerpiece, so this is a super easy way to continue with that pattern. So I'm gonna do the same thing for the chargers and the big trees that are going on the back of the chairs. Sam, I didn't expect this, but do you see how the marble kind of looks like a wood grain, almost? That's perfect. It's so cool. They look amazing. They look awesome. All right, this is gonna get tricky. I decided to take areca palms, and I'm sitting here creating the tail of the actual chair. Okay, okay. We wanted the drama to go from all the way above the table, all the way to the floor. Guerdy's working on her chair covers. What I'm loving about that is, I have no idea what's happening. I realize that we've created a two-hour project but for a five-man team. We gotta move on from chairs, so hurry, hurry, hurry. Guys, we have one hour! Ahhh, it's not enough time! one hour. I need like six. Me, too! All right, so, I'm looking to make chair-back covers out of this very fuzzy, fuzzy fur. You want to keep the blade as close to the backing fabric as possible. This way, you don't hurt the strands. So I cut out several rectangles of faux fur, stitched in some ribbon ties to secure it to the chair, and we're ready to go. Terry, terry, terry, terry, terry. I love it. Okay. I love it. We're going to do, I think, some tie-dye. The next thing I'm moving on to are the tie-dye napkins and the tie-dye placemats. I'm gonna fold all of my linens like a fan. I'm gonna try to make it even, and then I'm gonna fold them into triangles. We have very simple elements, but the color and the pattern is gonna make the tablescape go from basic and plain to really exciting and layered. I always put my tie-dye in a squirt bottle. That is something that I have learned just from doing this with kids. It's such an easy way to control it. It's also really quick, and quick is the name of the game right now. Okay, I'm gonna let that sit. Well, I gotta do it, so... So, Mario, when you come over here now, just be really careful. There's a black line of wet paint. Okay. I need to continue the 2d all over the table, so I outline the perimeter of the table. Mario's cutting out paper to decorate the top of the table. Okay, what do you think? Awesome. Based on the judges' feedback, we realized we really needed to amplify the Christmas theme, so we're doing "joy" and "peace" cut-out. So, hopefully, that'll work. Guerdy and Garrett. What is going on? There's a storm. There's a storm, especially right now. We need to really tailor this runner out. Yes. We want to cover this motor. Yes. Thank you, sir. For you. Thank you. I want you to know I'm thinking gold star. okay, good luck. I promise, Kim, that I was gonna cover that turntable. I think that the time we used for that is gonna come back to bite us. Mario, I need you to work some magic for me. Come on, work some magic for me. You guys got this. At this point, I am feeling so much better about the runner working, and I can't wait to get it together with Charlotte's help. Oh, my god, I'm freaking out. like, not in a good way. So, this is the moment of truth. It's time to put together this runner. This one, it's going. This is going lower. It is? Yep. You keep saying, I know it's gonna work. I know it's gonna work." but I know it's gonna work! I know it. all right, ready? Yep. Okay. ♪ yeeees ♪ okay, you are like my secret ingredient. at this point, we have to get the tape off of the table so we can set up the tablescape. So we pull the tape back. Clean edge, clean edge, clean edge, clean edge. They're minimalists. It's really clean. I appreciate that, but I feel like Sam and Charlotte need to give me magic. Make my heart grow three sizes. I kind of like that. So, I'm painting all of these leftover hand-pressed flowers from the first round in order for them to really pop at the base of the centerpiece. Hi, guys. Hello. How are you? Doing good. How are you doing? It's coming together. I like the notes that you took. We're both like the idea of lilac with this existing color story that we had. I'm digging it because it actually picks up the colors in the glitter ... little leaves. That's exactly what Mariana used as inspiration. I like it. Okay, good luck, guys. Thank you. Thank you so much. It's time to unwrap my tie-dye. I'm saying a prayer. Craft gods, please. And I open it up. yeees. It looks amazing. It's the perfect amount of white linen and color. I'm super excited. Yeah, you slayed it. Is that good? Mm-hmm. Okay. Eight minutes to go, guys! Eight minutes?! Eight minutes. You can do a lot in eight minutes. 80? 8. Augh! We got our centerpiece? Yeah, we got our centerpiece. Awesome. Oh, my god. Things are getting crazy. I'm sweating. And then, Mario has this idea that he wants to add turkeys. There's a lot of magic routines with handkerchiefs, and this is an old vaudeville gag. You know me ... there's gotta always be an excuse to do some type of magic. And if you pull these corners like this, it looks like a little turkey. you see? I'm making these turkeys, and then mikie comes, you know? Okay, Mario and Katie, how are you guys doing? The one thing that's jumping out at me at the table is the turkeys. I don't know. You don't know! Mikie does not like the turkeys. Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! eight minutes to go, guys. Eight minutes?! No, g...! Mario has this idea that he wants to add turkeys. I'm so excited to do this. Mikie does not like the turkeys. I'm gonna do some magic and make them disappear. Oh, god. oh, no. Instead of heeding his advice and ditching the turkeys, we dig in deeper. Little booties. All right, yeah, let's rock it. We add oversized frill booties. You know, like those paper things that you put on roast turkeys? That really helps. they talked about wanting to honor children. If you were five, would you have liked that? No. How are those coming? The snow globes? Think we're good. To continue our swan theme, we're gonna make individual snow globes... As party favors. ...As party favors. Just gonna glue the base of the snow globe to this one. Okay. Oh, no. Putting this swan in this little globe is like putting a ship in a bottle. Right. It's a nightmare. Come on, get in there. Okay. we wanted to be as dramatic as possible, so we decided to do a little spinning of the plates, as well. Are the swans spinning, too? We might get a little vertigo. you've got this, Katherine. We can do it. Time is running out. We're getting the last touches. We are. I'm gonna do lines on the chargers. Wha? Everything's drawn. My hand's shaking, but I'm trying my best. Katie, the bubbles. Try to do it. Man, if I can rock this somewhere... We need one more magic trick. Just one more. two minutes, guys. Make the most of it. We got this. I'm just gonna do all the lights, and then I need your help. We'll put it on top and tuck the lights in, you know? Yeah. We're setting the runner up on the table. We're getting the lights underneath. Let's add some sparkle. The table is so fun to put together. We have the pattern of the placemat. We have the wonderful wood of the chair backers. I'm making little party favors for all of our guests to take home. Everything that we're making for this tablescape is made from wood, so gifting a seedling is kind of our way of giving back. Crafters, get your sugarplums moving. You got one minute light. we're getting there. Okay, what else do we need? Jay starts counting down, and I reach over ... I grab these two glittered branches, and I start smacking them together. I didn't know what else to do. 7...6...5...4... Okay, good. Yep. ...2... Ahhhh! ...1. Hands up! what just happened? What just happened? it's one of those things, like ... there's so much I would do. Like I would make everything perfect, you know? - Oh, my god. - We did it. What do you think? I think it's good. I love it. We did good. Oh, gosh. Oh, wow. it's like I'm sweating. Charlotte, Sam, the woodworking continues. I see. I'm actually really impressed. That's a lot of wood work. It was a lot. It was a lot. so, the theme is "modern evergreen holiday." it's a little bit of an ode to the forest to just say, like, "thanks for all the wood that we used for this table." it's kind of cool. I love how clean everything is. Yes! So, it has very clean lines. I like that there's a little disco in the forest with the lights. But I have to say, I love the favors. Are those real? They're real. Okay, because you cut so many trees down to make this. Exactly ... that was the thought, is, "here are some seedlings." I love it. I think it's perfect. I'd use it for my table. my question for you is, how practical is it to actually paint the table? See, 'cause if that was in my house, my mother would beat yo... The one note that I have ... I feel like a surprise color could have helped my eye travel the way it needs to. Yeah, for sure. All right. Thank you so much, ladies. We'll see you soon. Thank you so much. Thank you. I love it. Thank you so much. guerdy and Garrett. Now, tell us about this storm tablescape. We decided to do "stormy holiday" with a black tie twist. We wanted to give a nod to swans dining out in the snow. I have to say, my favorite part of the whole tablescape is the little swan on the globe. These are just storage containers that have a screw top, so we had to work the swan in there. And then, we put the snow in, so it becomes a snow globe. I love that. I have to say, I have never seen anything like this, so I love that. And I really appreciate you taking the note ... covering the base ... but I think there is a lot going on. I appreciate that you crafted the feathers yourself. I will say, though, the finishing on the chair covers, it's just not great. All right, thank you guys so much. Good luck, and we'll see you later. Hey, guys. Hello, welcome to our party. We created a winter wonderland fantasy tablescape. I think this is really lovely. It's ethereal. It's soft. There are so many details. You delivered on the sewing, for sure. I love and appreciate that you painted the flowers, that you added color to the centerpiece. I think that's great. There's a lot going on, but it's not overwhelming. The chairs are done impeccable. The craftsmanship is really, really beautiful. I love all the things that you made by hand. I wish maybe I saw a little more of that. I agree, I felt like the centerpiece itself was slightly too "purchased" versus crafting it. All right. Thank you, guys. Thank you. We'll see you guys later. Thank you. Thank you. Mario and Katie! So, you guys won the quick craft. Yes. You had a leg up on the competition. Now, tell us about your tablescape. We wanted to bring you guys the holidays in 2d. With my magic show, a big thing is accessibility ... seeing things with construction paper or yarn. Even the trees we made out of plastic spoon heads, you know? I love that. But this table does magic. Oh, let's see the magic! If I howl, it does something. Watch. I think this is so fresh. Like, so fresh. I love the graphic quality. I really focus in on the elements you want me to focus on, and I love the spoon trees. That is the definition of crafting, y'all ... I mean, taking something that you never would have thought of and transforming it, finding new life for it. I absolutely love everything about this table, but I always notice linens. The tablecloth is slightly uneven. It's uneven, I know. This is such a "simple" concept that all the details matter. So some of the marker lines on the plates and the bowls, I feel like a little more attention to those details would have really just sealed the deal. All right, thank you guys so much. This is gonna be really hard to judge. So hard. Oooh. Thank you guys so much. Thank you. See you soon. crafters, I'd be honored to have a meal at any of those tables. You all really nailed it, but, unfortunately, one team will be ending their time in the workshop now. It's time to see which team was naughty and which team was nice. Mario and Katie and Sam and Charlotte, please open your presents. I'm so scared. congratulations. Those ornaments mean you are safe, and you will continue on to the next round. Mariana and terry, guerdy and Garrett, one of you will receive a lump of coal and be asked to leave our workshop. Please open your presents. Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! Mariana and terry, guerdy and Garrett, please open your presents. Congratulations, guys. Guerdy and Garrett, unfortunately, that coal means you guys are not advancing to the next round. Thank you for the opportunity. It was so fun. Thank you, guys. Take care. Good luck. You guys are fabulous. You, too. congratulations, crafters, for making it to the next round. Awesome! Congrats, guys. Now it's time for my favorite part of the holiday season ... trimming the Christmas tree. these days, theme trees are all the rage, but, for me, it's the tree topper that really steals the show. For your next quick craft challenge, you'll have 45 minutes to create a stunning tree topper that will set the tone for your theme tree. The team with the ultimate tree topper will gain a huge advantage in the colossal craft. And trust me, this advantage is going to be lit. what does that mean? okay, teams, get ready to deck the halls. Your 45 minutes... ...Starts... Now! ...Now! Now! All right. Okay, um ... so, what are you thinking? I was thinking the chattering teeth. Oh, that's a good idea. We could have it, like, open. We need something circular, like a donut. Yes! We're gonna use cardboard to create the 3d image of the chattering teeth, 3d image of the donut, and then we're gonna cover that donut with felt, felt sprinkles, and add a little wire and tape and hot glue. And that's our tree topper. Like, what we do at home with our kids ... we get delivery boxes, cut them up, make stuff out of ... Cardboard is the most amazing medium. I gotta just try not to cut my finger off. Yeah, be careful, please. I work with my kids with PVC pipe all the time. And that's so easy to cut. Yeah, I think we'll use the chop saw...it's super easy. What I love about hardware is that everyone has access to a hardware store, and everyone does not have access to a craft store. We want to put a modern geometric twist on the star, and it seems to us that we could use PVC pipes, adding some colors, softening it a little bit with tassels out of a mop. I'm gonna work on the tassels. Okay, I'll be back. Go. While Charlotte works on the tassels, I am going to take the PVC pipes to the miter saw, cut them, and then paint them so they dry in time to assemble. These are gonna be awesome. So, what are we thinking? Elves ... like, pointed ears, hats. Well, hats, because it's the top of the tree, so it should be elf hats. Our tree topper will consist of three elves' hats sewn together and embellished with glitter spirals and pompoms. The color scheme is gonna be very, very bright. Something that you would see maybe in a children's book. okay. First things first, I cut the fabrics. I grab my sewing machine and start to get to work. using craft felt that's pretty easy to sew. This is the spongy quality, so it's a little more forgiving for your stitching if you're doing some detail work. Mario and Katie, doves on the tree? Doves on the tree! That would be too expected. Got to keep you guys guessing. We know we only have 45 minutes to do this, so we're trying to keep it simple. Mario is working on cutting the donut. We're gonna roll it up to give it some flexibility so when I hot glue it, it'll form better. Okay. okay. Did you guys just catch Charlotte? She just pulled out a mop head and put it on their table. Like, a mop head. I wanted to make tassels out of a mop because it's already a nice big chunky cotton fiber, and big is the name of the game with this star. So I count the different strands of the mop. I fold them over, wrap it around with a piece of tape, and I'm done. It's genius. Hey, crafters, we got 25 minutes to go. Oh, my god. Okay, okay. I gotta tape faster. This is insanity. This is insane. I was feeling confident, but now I'm just, like ... I'm running out of time. I think we're gonna do six triangles, and then we'll connect the points so it has some structure to it. Charlotte is doing this amazing thing where she is running the wire through the PVC piping to make a series of shapes. But we are worried that it is big and potentially heavy, and it needs to go up on a tree. So, I think this will sit like ... the tree will sort of come to here. Right, yeah. Exactly. Okay. I'm glancing at the other competitors, and they're, like, rocking out piping, and I'm sitting here looking at this beat-up mail... just cardboard and paint and tape and wire. So, if the message doesn't come across, like... Yeah, we're in trouble. We're in trouble. oh, that looks good. That looks good. At least it's one of the colors. You got this, Katie. So I cover the teeth with tape so that when we paint it, it doesn't get soaked into the cardboard. So we can get that bright color ... that bright red, that bright white ... real quick you know? It looks like teeth. Okay, okay. So, that's good. That's good. So, I got to just do that one more time. So, I am working on the crown of the tree topper. You know, our last challenge was so monochromatic, and I wanted to repurpose these spiral sprays. So I start gluing these pompoms to the perimeter of this tree topper, and I realize it's gonna take forever. Hand me the bin. Put it right in the middle. If we don't finish covering this base, we're screwed. Like, it just won't look finished. Okay, not to be a nutcracker, but you guys have five minutes left. Oh, my gooooosh! okay. Good? Yes. The insi...you know? Oh, yeah, the inside. I know we didn't have time to do the inside. Are they gonna finish the back of that donut? I mean, I don't think there's a plan for that. They're not considering the 360° view of the tree right now. I don't feel good about this. Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! Is it too many tassels? "too many tassels"? okay, Charlotte, okay. It might be the most wonderful time of the year, but not if you don't finish those three toppers. You guys got two minutes left. Two minutes! I got this. I got this. I'm gluing it. You put the pom-poms on. Pom-poms? Okay. Yep. I'm burning my fingers. We're dumping these pom-poms on the tree topper. Expletive, expletive, expletive. Okay. Got it. okay. One minute, guys! Ahh, one minute! What can you do in 60 seconds? This is easily the most stressful thing I've ever done in my life, and I went through 9 years of college, like... I've had five children, and this is right up there. 30 seconds, guys! Maybe we can throw some tape on it real quick. Can you do that? On the inside? What? Hurry up! We don't have time to put the white. I don't even know if we have time. 5...4...3...2...1... Hands up! alright, so, Charlotte, Sam, what was the concept here? Hardware holiday. I see PVC pipe. Yes. I know I saw a mop head. Yes. This is so fun. I think it's so unexpected, and I am a huge fan of a humble material being elevated, which I think you guys do really well. It's whimsical, and the colors are not traditional, which I'm loving. My only nervousness is the scale. Yeah, I agree. The scale has me really wondering how the balance is going to happen with the rest of the tree, but I like that you went big, so I'm ready to see. I love it. I think it's genius. Thank you. Cool. Thank you. Hey, Mariana and terry. talk to us about your concept here. Our tree topper is a whimsical elfin holiday. It's so colorful. You guys went completely opposite from the tabletop challenge. Yes. And so textural. I feel, construction-wise, there are a couple of little issues for me. The base is a little off-kilter. That's my nit to pick. I have to disagree. I'm sorry. I think the craftmanship of the sewing is spot-on. This sewing is fantastic. There's no beef with the sewing. So what are you saying? Look at the balance of it. It's whimsical. Okay... oh, and I will say one more thing. I love how the tree topper goes all around, because sometimes you do see the tree from all angles. Well, good luck to you guys. We'll see you in a bit. Katie, Mario. What was the concept here? If kids could decorate a tree, what would they do? Exactly. I love this. Like, so deeply. I have never seen this kind of tree topper before. It's fresh. It's a really cool departure of a tree topper. I love the use of material. It's so creative. You could feel the cheer from it, you know? Awesome. Yeah. I think the only thing I am concerned that I can see ... the inside, unfinished cardboard of the teeth. It's looking a little rough, unless you're standing right where we're standing. okay, teams, it's time to see whose tree topper has all the holiday magic. You guys were clear on your decision? We were. So clear. Alright. Let's see. The winner of this quick craft challenge is... Sam and Charlotte! the green team! Congrats, Sam and Charlotte, you guys have earned a major advantage for the next colossal challenge. So speaking of, now that you have the perfect topper, it is time to trim the rest of the tree. for your colossal craft, you will have two hours to decorate your entire tree. Your trees must include ... handcrafted ornaments, a tree skirt, garland, a motorized or moving part, and of course, no tree is complete without lights. Speaking of lights, Sam and Charlotte, because you won the quick craft, you'll get to use already-detangled lights. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. And the rest of you guys ... well, you'll get to use these. Merry Christmas. No, no! Wow. This is so mean. I'm sorry. It's so mean. No... This is a total Christmas nightmare. The rest of you guys ... well, you'll get to use these. Merry Christmas. No, no! Wow. This is a total Christmas nightmare. Crafters, you guys have two hours, starting... - Now! - Whew. Alright, so... We got enough hats, so. Think booties, think sleigh. Eyeballs. They're round, like ornaments. Eyeballs. Why don't we do a tree skirt with dowels? I love that idea. Like ... our topper was hardware-store-inspired, so we're just gonna continue that theme through the rest of the tree. I'm going to be building the tree skirt out of plywood and wood dowels. PVC piping for a colorful garland. For ornaments, chip brushes with the ends dipped, and for the moving element, a spinning snow globe. Godspeed. Got this. What is a Christmas tree without lights? Oh, no. This is ridiculous. It's like a ball of yarn. Wait, hold on. Hold on. This is a tangled mess. Oh, my god. This is bad. This is bad. We have to untangle this before we can even start decorating our tree. Ugh. My magic is not working! For a moment, when I was looking at it, I was like, "man, this would be an awesome tree topper." Yes! Yes, we got it! yes. We did it! Alright. The theme of our tree is whimsical, elfin holiday. We had elf hats, I thought we should have the elf booties as well. We want to use the spirals that were on our tree topper in our garland. The motorized element is gonna be elf legs that are sticking out of the side of the tree. For handmade ornaments, we're making sleds out of Popsicle sticks. So I'm stuffing the sock, trying to make it look like a leg, so it looks like our elves are just diving into our tree. How do you like our foot? Oh, that looks so good. Cool. Hey, crafters, guess what? 30 minutes down, and we got an hour and 30 minutes to go. So you've got an hour and 30 minutes. I saw Mario just panic. So when you do eyes, like, super cartoony, full of colors. We have to think about the style of the topper we did. We call our tree "holidays through the eyes of the children. We're gonna do eyeballs. Yeah. We're gonna continue the donuts and the amazing slimeballs that you create. The garland's gonna mimic that zigzag of the felt crowns. For our moving element, we're gonna take these ornaments, these eyeballs, wire up a servomotor, and make the eyes look around. It's looking actually pretty good. Yeah! I'm gonna try to mount a servomotor to this. I'll see if I can get... For our tree, we're going to incorporate PVC piping into a fun, colorful garland, so I have to cut PVC pieces, drill holes in them so that we can attach them together later. When Charlotte comes out here, she can spray paint them with all the rest of the garlands so it's all the same color. Okay, I love this blue, I love this pink. I think a little green ... that's gonna be perfect. For ornaments, I'm starting with the brushes, because I want them to dry, so rather than dipping them, I'm just gonna paint the top of the bristles, so there won't be as much paint. Fun tip ... they will look dipped, but they're not. So, those look great. Alright. For the ornaments, I'm gonna make a sleigh out of Popsicle sticks. let's see here. Aw, did you write all the names of our nephews and nieces on there? I did. Aww. Holiday crafting is a lot more fun when it's meaningful, so we're putting the names of our nieces and nephews on each sled. This tree is definitely for the kid in all of us. So now it's time to build the drum for this tree skirt that the dowels are going to be attached to. Timber! so far, so good, but clock's running. It's really important that the circles on the outside of the drum are perfect, to make this beautiful, continuous circle shape around the tree. So, what do you think? That'll be awesome. Yeah? Do it. Put a little shimmy. Put a little shimmy. I'm in garland-making mode. I am spray-painting the PVC pipes and I'm spray-painting tin caps. These are really similar to the colors that we have on the topper. Okay. So, we got some motors. So we're gonna add a servomotor and then I'm gonna try to control that. My favorite thing about robotics is the simple, humble servomotor. It's just a little, plastic arm that moves 180, and you can program it where you want it to move. look at that. And I took that servomotor, attached it to an eyeball. So this, technically, should move. Technically, it should move. And I'm gonna do a test right now and see if it actually works. Robotics is a way for me to bring my art to life. That's what I love about it. It's alive! Yes! It's alive! I love it! So it's just gonna sporadically, like, look back and forth like that? Yeah. Exactly. that's perfect. I feel like your tree is giving me dirty looks. I don't like it. I need shorter screws. Do we have any, Sam? I've got them, yes. Thank you. Okay. Okay. This is edge banding, and typically you use it to cover the raw edge on plywood. I'm assembling it with wire in the middle to give it a little structure, and these are gonna be really fun Christmas tree ornaments. These are gonna balance the large PVC tree topper, so we decide to bring the tassels into these ornaments. Not only does it add to the size of the ornaments, but it brings in more tassels, which I am always a fan of. That looks awesome. All of the paint for the dowels is dry. It's time to see if they fit on this drum. We need a drum roll. nailed it. Gonna keep going. Gonna push out as many as I can. What's our time? We're halfway there. You've got one hour left. Yes! No! Mutiny! I'm in the zone. Things are going well, and then all of a sudden... ugh! ...The nail gun jams. Ka-chunk. So annoying. I don't have time to fix a nail gun. Charlotte! Yes? The nail gun jammed. If we don't have a tree skirt, we could be eliminated. The tree is, like, naked without a tree skirt. On a time limit here. It's scary. the glue gun is plugged in. Oh, yep. That one's plugged in. I'm in the zone. I'm building the tree skirt out of some plywood and wood dowels, and then all of a sudden, the nail gun jams. Ka-chunk. so annoying. If we can't un-jam the nail gun, do we hot glue them? Can we hot glue them on? Yeah. I don't have time to fix a nail gun on top of building a tree skirt, so I'm gonna have to just hot glue the rest of the dowels to the tree skirt does it work? Yeah, and there's no nail holes. Luckily, I nailed enough of the dowels into the tree skirt to make it super sturdy, so using the glue gun is totally working. Not what I wanted to do, but it's fine. making little decorative things for the garland. Yeowch! This glue gun is hot. Our plan for the garland is to take blue, sparkly mesh and bend some pipe cleaners into a whimsical shape. Glue pom-poms, and then attach the whole thing to a garland. I'm getting goose bumps. Do you see Mariana and terry's tree? That garland has twirled it out. Okay. Right now, I'm doing this tree skirt. What gets me nervous is that there's so much going on that if they don't keep it clean and neat-looking, it's going to look like a complete circus. Yeah. I agree. I'm gonna do the garland. I'm just cutting big, bold zigzag and attach it all together and create a whole ribbon around the tree with that. We really wanted to go into the brains of our kids. What would they put on a Christmas tree if they had free reign to do whatever they wanted to it? What's the next step? Should I do the slime green balls? Slime! Slime. Okay. I'm gonna melt hot glue on these ornaments, and then we'll paint them bright green, like a fluorescent green. Our kids love slime. They're always trying to make slime, add things to slime. There has to be slime. So I'm just spraying them, give them a good coat, let them dry off. And it clicked. Like, one coat of that made it shine like slime. Alright. I'm gonna let these dry. I'll be back. Time, anyone? There's only 45 minutes to go. Nooo! Ahh! We have to get this done. We're good. We're good. We're good. Charlotte, please start to decorate the tree. You're getting me so nervous. Where are the lights, Sam and Charlotte? We're getting there! We're getting there! Where are the lights? We have a lot to do. I'm sensing a theme here, where we just love to make our lives difficult. Down to the wire. Ahh. Hey, terry, since we have all these legs, what if our motorized thing is, like, legs kicking? I love it. Yeah? That is a great idea. Okay, I'm gonna make pants. I said, "okay, well, I'm making pants." I am making little, elfin, crazy pants. terry, what do you think? I love it. Okay, cool. So terry found this great, little motor. And there's a mechanism in there that makes the legs go up and down. And this ... it's an attachment that secures to the trunk of the tree. We incorporate these moving elf legs that are sticking out of the side of the tree. Alright. Does it feel good? Yes. Okay. - Ready? - 1...2...3. It's time to install the tree skirt, which means that one of us ... I choose Charlotte ... has to lift up the tree... Ready? Walk forward. ...Because we just love making our lives difficult. Uh-oh. We're good. Oh, my god. oh. Oh, it fits perfectly. Oh, my god. tree is in, it fits, and it looks unbelievable. Awesome. I'm sweating. Sam, I feel like I need to move on to the globe. Okay. We still need to figure out this motorized component. We really just need a fan or something to create movement, we need some fake snow, and then we need a globe. I see this fishbowl, and that will work perfectly for the globe. Maybe I can cut a hole in the bucket to create a place for the wind to come in. And I decide to tape a piece of PVC pipe to the end of the hairdryer, to create the wind for the snow globe. Genius. This will be a miniature paint can, and so I want paint dripping. I try to think of some cute, little, mini hardware items that might work. I'm seriously amazed that you just, like, made a snow globe out of things in the workshop. I'm really impressed how you guys pull your concepts together in the final moments of a challenge. - Wait, did you just ... - You mean like this? How did you just do that? This tree is very, like, hardware chic. Do you have a black marker somewhere? Oh, you're using that? I'm using mine, but here. Here. Okay. Ho, ho, ho, there's only 10 minutes to go. I'm just gonna outline some of these boxes to match that tablescape. That looks amazing, Katie. So, one of the ideas is to put eyeballs inside of a present and then have the lid pop up. I hot-glued the servomotor to the inside of the case. This is gonna open up the box. It's the moment of truth. We have to test the eyeball present. Are you ready? Yeah. Okay. Here goes. and we stand there and we wait and nothing's happening. Hold up. I need this robotic element to work. That's the kicker. I need this robotic element to work. That's the kicker. yeah. it did work! That is so good. Okay. It's on a little delay, so... I was a little scared. I'm not gonna lie. So, it's on a delay. It'll go every, like... That's perfect. Yeah? I love the surprise element. You don't know when it's going to happen. That's why you have to keep your eyes on the prize. terry and Mariana. The sleds are cute, but they are very visually disconnected from the rest, so tie it together. Thank you. Maybe some spray-glue with glitter. Glitter. These are visually disconnected, so let's put a pom-pom. Let's put pom-poms. Alright, guys. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but 2 minutes, so use them wisely. Is there time for one more? With minutes to spare, I run over and I grab pom-poms and cross my fingers that it's what she's looking for. I'm looking at balance. Do we want to add more legs? We need to go all out, and take the risk. Okay. Clock is counting down, and I realize, "oh, my god. We have so much empty space." we're putting legs all over the place. Like, we got to go for it. Literally 60 seconds. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my god. There's no way. 5...4...3...2... Mariana, make a decision really quick... 1! Hands up! we did it. Yeah, we did. Oh, my god. Sam, Charlotte. Talk to us about the tree. So, the theme for our tree is "hardware holiday." we have PVC pipe, edge banding, we have brushes, we have zip ties ... oh, and we have some of our mop tassels that we love. - Really smart. - I love the snow globe. How are you achieving this? A hairdryer. This is the only time I use my hairdryer, is for crafts. I have to say, you've taken the whole hardware situation to the next level. I love the little bulbs made out of edge banding. That's such a versatile item. I love seeing it used this way here. I love the PVC piping, how you cut it to make the garland. I just love it. The tree skirt ... Sam, you got me nervous. The gun broke, right? Yeah, it jammed up, so I ended up hot-gluing the rest of the dowels. This is truly a showstopper. I love it. My only negative, I would say, is there just needed to be a little more depth into the tree. And that could be with light and the ornaments, just the placement. Thank you guys so much. - Thank you. - Good luck. - Hey! - Hi! Mariana, are your fingers tired from all the sewing? Yes. tell us about your tree. It is magical elfin holiday. - Elfin holiday. Okay. - I like it. We used craft felt that comes in really bright colors, which is obviously what we're going for this time around. What are your moving elements for your tree? Please work. that's me looking for my gift. I notice there are names on the sleds. So, those are the names of our nieces and nephews. Oh, wow. That's great. Aww. I love it. As a seamstress, I just want to give you kudos. Your sewing technique? Flawless. Thank you. From you? Thank you so much. I mean, you really have executed. The seam work is fabulous. I love the garland as well. And the ornaments ... I love the little sleds. I'm not necessarily loving how those little sleds play with the rest of the tree. Maybe a little glitter, maybe a little paint, just to pull it in and tie it in. Okay, so when you say "ornaments," I'm looking for the ornaments. I don't see ornaments. That's the only thing that's missing for me, so I would have loved to see something tucked away. So, that's my only negative. Alright. Thank you guys so much. We're gonna get the elf out of here, by your elfin tree. Thank you. - Hey, guys. - Hello. Mario, wow. You're already ... you already look nervous. Talk to us about the tree. The theme of our tree is the holidays through the eyes of the children. We have two kids. If they could pick what to put on our tree, what would they say? And they would totally say something like, "donuts and eyeballs," 'cause kids are weird. but what about the little guy popping out of the presents? I live for him. So, I'm gonna be completely honest ... I don't like it. Oh. I love it. I actually thought he didn't like it. I'm so surprised I do love it because I'm more of a traditional Christmas caroler. It's so inventive, it's creative,it's you guys, and the tree looks completely filled. The whole tree, it's saturated. It looks really well-put-together. And I appreciate the depth. I appreciate that you buried eyeballs deeper into it so that we're seeing layers within the tree, but I'm not loving the detail on the eyeballs. I'm looking at disease happening here. I don't know what's happening. I feel like that's the beauty of the tree. Like, it shouldn't be perfect. But the eyeballs are a big feature. They're a big feature, mikie. It's an eyesore. What do you want? This is what I'm saying. It's an eyesore. well, thank you guys so much. Good luck to you. Thank you guys. o-m-tree, you guys really brought it to this challenge. Santa would be proud to put presents under any of these epic trees, but unfortunately, 'tis the season for our next elimination. It's time to open up your presents. For some of you, it might not be what you're looking for. Open them up. unfortunately, 'tis the season for our next elimination. Open them up. aww. I know, it's not the best present. I'm so inspired by you guys. Yeah. Team Mariana and terry, sadly, it's your time to leave the workshop. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Thank you, guys. Bye, guys. Bye. Good luck. Bye, guys. Congratulations, crafters. Oh, my gosh. That means one of you here is going to win the $10,000 and the title. So I need you guys to get your rest, and see you tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you. what... Oh, my god. Happened to the workshop? We see these two adorable houses. Ring it. did somebody just ring our jingle bell? Welcome to sweet street. Hi, guys. congratulations, crafters. You guys have made it to round 3, the final round. For your final colossal craft, you need to turn these plain houses and yards into a winter wonderland that is sure to wow us. And since we're on holiday sweet street, your crafts should be inspired by some of your favorite holiday confections. Crafters, you'll have five hours for this challenge. With $10,000 on the line, we want you to blow-ho-ho-ho us away with these houses. Okay, teams, this is it. You've got five hours to deck the halls, the lawn and the mailbox. Which means your time starts... Now! I don't do that outside of our house all that often. I am pretty accustomed to decorating trees, decorating inside the house. I don't do much to decorate the outside of our house. I don't know what that looks like. When I think of candy, I think of, like, pastels. Yes, exactly. Should we just do like pastel, pastel, pastel? Our theme is sweet holiday charm, and we're gonna give you all the cavities. We're thinking hard candy lights wrapped in cellophane, cake pops for the outside of the house, candy buttons, led lights on our planter boxes, giant gumdrops on either side of the walkway, candy necklaces. We've got a lot of candy on the brain. First things first, we need to cover the red door, but it's a gamble. Covering red paint is really hard, and we don't have a lot of time... It's always a gamble when you're painting over such a dark color with a light color... ...And it is not going fast. ...But I also just don't think that our plan works with a red door. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. How does that feel? Yeah, I mean, we may have to shorten each one of them, I think. Alright, so let's rock it. I think so. So, I'm gonna start drawing it out. Our plan for our holiday sweet street is a pop art Christmas carnival experience, and we're gonna bring back that giant teeth structure. We're gonna put a big mouth. It's gonna be chomping on a giant candy apple. And we want a big peppermint candy melting onto the lawn. The walkway, we're gonna do a ball pit of candy leading to the mouth. Like, a consistent critique that we've gotten from the judges is the level of neatness, so I think we should try our best to really, like, tighten up the lines. I agree. Because they're all huge items, like, it's gonna take us a long time to do this. Yeah. So, that's scary. This is feeling pretty good. Awesome. Yeah. So, we started with the teeth. We need to paint them, and then we need to let it dry. We have to paint the inside of the mouth too, you know? 'cause that's one of the critiques. We can't disappoint them. Yeah, exactly. It's a process. It's a process! There's $10,000 on the line, Katie. I can't believe we made it this far. It's unbelievable. I know. It's crazy. It's awesome. I've painted one coat on the door... ...So I go work on some of the other projects. I'm gonna cut a bunch of pool noodles, pool noodles actually could be the perfect shape for a giant, oversize candy necklace. When I cut foam, I use an electric carving knife, and it just goes through the foam like butter. Now, I don't want this to look like a pool noodle, so I need to shape it a little bit more. So now, all of a sudden, pool noodle candy. It really is coming to life. The pastel colors on the pool noodles have transformed it, and I'm super excited, because it looks like a candy necklace. while Charlotte is painting, I am working on the cake pops for the outside of the house. To make a cake pop, I cut circles out of plywood, and I am going to texture them using a wall texture spray, spray-paint them in those pastel colors and then hang them up with dowels. I'm so stoked on this texture. It looks so good! It's fun. It's a great ... I'm not usually a pink person, but I feel like pink might be the one. I was gonna say, you're coming around. I'm a changed woman, Charlotte. There's a mouth. The mouth needs something to eat, so that's coming. I need to create big, bold elements out of cardboard, 'cause the teeth are huge. We're creating spearmint candy. I want to make this one 3-d, 'cause I want it to stand on its own. It looks amazing done, but so time-consuming. We're also cutting out this candy apple with felt sprinkles. You guys are awesome. thank you. What you do with cardboard, it's ... I cannot wait to see. okay, I don't like that sound. We're in the zone. We're getting work done. We're feeling so successful, and in walks jay. Oh, hark! Is that angels singing? Oh, no, that's just me here, ready to deliver another twist. Oh, great. What ... how ... there's ... what? okay, I don't like that sound. We're in the zone. We're getting work done, we're feeling so successful, and in walks jay. Oh, hark. Is that angels singing? Oh, no, that's just me here, ready to deliver another twist. There's a twist! I mean, we have so much to do already. How could we possibly incorporate any kind of twist? We all know that everyone loves to visit an over-the-top holiday display, so in addition to decking out your homes, you'll have to give your house a little extra magic and add in an interactive element. What? What? What does that even mean? Can we put a bowl of candy? Does that count? It's up to you. You just got to figure it out. Interactive, and not a bowl of candy. What ... how ... there's ... what? Mario, what's the motor that we need? What is it? How can we utilize this design and make it interactive? So, what if you open the mailbox and everything lights up and the fog comes up? Add the sign to open the mailbox. How are we gonna have time to do all that? I don't know. What is something we could do without having, like, an advanced degree in engineering. Right, or magicianry. What about just, like, a game? Are there games that people can play with? Yeah. Yeah, totally. There's so many yard games. Like, yard games. Yard games. I actually made, like, a bean bag toss game before. I could probably build one of those pretty quickly. Like these guys. Yeah, with a hole, and then you toss. Okay. The coolest part about making a game like this is you can paint it whatever color or pattern you want. The trickiest part is just making sure that everything is square and precise, and obviously, we're short on time and I obsess. Check this out. Yeah, she did. Yeah, I did. Look at that. Woo! I'm gonna go ahead and assemble, okay? I'm holding it with one hand, and it feels fine. So then, we can just put something that stretches out over here, right? Yeah. So with a mouth this big, we have to build supports. I'm so worried that that mouth is gonna be unfinished, falling off. But it's part of the process. We wanted it to look solid. it's gonna work. Okay. And then the finishing touch is this big, long plastic pole. It looks awesome. It does look good. the candy toss is assembled. It went together beautifully. Oh, my god. It looks so flipping cute. We definitely need lights. I have this idea to transform basic string lights and somehow make them into hard candies. So, I noticed these takeout containers, and I just thought that they would give really nice shape to our hard candies. Takeout containers, Christmas lights, cellophane on top. Like, she made life-size hard candy. And she's making hard candy. So ingenious. Those look like hard candy lights. I had this great idea for the walkway ... like, a candy walkway. I am going to dump a bunch of these balls and start, to see what it looks like. Okay. Just to see. Do it. So, I made a little cage, here. There's not enough ball pit balls. It's very sparse. It's just sparse ball pit balls. How are we gonna fill this? There's no way. This is impossible. I mean... oh, man. Is there any more? That's it. That's it? So what do I think? We get ornaments. Okay. I found plastic ornaments. I'm taking the tops off, sticking them in there, giving it some texture, some pop. no, it looks good. That's awesome. One of the things we want to do on the house is kind of swap out those planters. We want to make the front look like candy buttons. Two. Three. Gonna have to space it out a little more than that, Sam. We keep getting critiqued for, like, things looking messy, and I don't want it to look messy. One or two inches may seem like nothing, but there were a couple of times that I stood back and it just did not look right, and the last thing I want is for anybody's eyes to look at the spacing that's off. Hey. Type a. I know. I know. I'm trying. I'm trying. I know. Let's go. I look over, and Sam's been measuring for awhile, and now she's taking the candy buttons off. She's pulling the candy buttons off the planter. We are under a time crunch. This is so stressful. hey. Type a. I know. I know. I'm trying. I'm trying. I know. Let's go. I look over, and now she's taking the candy buttons off. She's pulling the candy buttons off the planter. I'm not sure what's happening. Oh, my lord. I am so happy that I took the extra time, because when I step back, they look amazing. Okay, I'm happy. I'm happy. You were right. I was right. Oh, yeah. That looks way better. Okay. see, now, the interactive part is Mario's strength. I feel confident he has another trick up his sleeve. Oh, always. Right? There was a fog machine I found, and then I'm, like, trying to hack this all to make a switch with the light machine. I'm using a microcontroller and a relay to do all the hard work. You open the lid, everything turns on. Press the button, smoke in the mailbox. This is not good. I went down a rabbit hole where I feel like I spent most of my time. I need another power strip. What am I doing? I'm using the wrong tool. So I don't know what's gonna happen, at all. Alright, guys. 90 minutes to go. That's an hour and a half. Wow. So, Katie, you making the sign? I'm trying to make the sign, so I'm hoping your thing works. Let's rock it. So, I decide to add the sign to carry on that graphic element, and also to just kick off our interactive element. Yeah, that looks great, actually, like... Yeah. I feel like these ... these should be colorful, right? Totally. Because they're like sprinkles, right? Like rainbow sprinkles? To bring a little texture and flair to the cake pops, I'm gonna make some sprinkles, and we will glue them on top. So I'm gonna add just a little bit of paint, to give it some color. sprinkles. And they're all painted. It's like going to craft battle. You want to hold it, maybe, and I drill? Yeahhh. Okay. The house has this big, empty space on the opposite side of the window that needs to be filled... Yeah, like right there, I think, would be perfect. Really? Okay. Actually, yeah. ...And cake pops are a really cool way to do that. Ahhh. Alright, guys, guess what? 20 minutes. - Oh, my god. - Oh, my gosh. What? if I painted a bunch of broken spoons from the first round, could I try to make some yellow ... you can try. Very short amount of time left, and then Mario has the great idea to use the spoon heads, like we used in the tablescape, paint them yellow, and they'll be like a little fake light. I really love that, you know? They're so cute. Oh, wow. But like, if you look at them from far away, they look like lights. And it represented so much from the first challenge, carrying it all the way through to the third. Mm-hmm. There's eight lights. Okay. Here. Alright. Yeah, I think it's really cute. Hey, crafters, guess what? ♪ five golden minutes ♪ The time has gone by so fast. I'm freaking out, because we have to finish this house, and there's just not much time left. Last few minutes, we are in total scramble mode, and we are just trying to make this house look perfect before the judges come to see it. Ahhh! 4...3...2...1. Hands up! I'm just gonna, like ... just take a nap. Mario, Katie! So, tell us about your holiday sweet street confection house. We've created the pop art Christmas carnival experience. It was really important to us to continue our story that we've been trying to present over all of the rounds. We wanted to also give a few callbacks to some of the other elements ... like we always love to incorporate a little bit of the black and white graphic design. And, you know, even just a little leaf on the apple And our little Christmas light spoons. Yes, oh, the spoons. The spoons. I loved those. So, when you guys ... whatever you want, you can ... follow the directions. Yeah. okay. so, when you guys ... whenever you want, you can ... follow the directions. Yeah. Okay. oh! Oh! I love a good smoke machine. Hope we don't set off any alarms. Just so great, watching jay, like, smoke and everything. Posing in the smoke. It's music video time. We knocked it out of the park. It was awesome. Yeah. You two ... I love this house. I love that it is fun. I love that it's kid-centered, and I think that the smoke machine from the mailbox is super, super fun. So, the negatives. You focused on three major elements. There's a lot of space that is untouched. For me, it's a little empty. So, I love the overall concept. It's a big impact. Obviously, you nailed the sweet part of it. It's candy, and it looks delicious. And the mouth again, it's carried through the whole theme. I think it's incredible. But ... there is always a but ... my biggest, biggest, biggest disappointment is the planter boxes ... that I can see the bushes, I can see the plastic. They're completely untouched. That, for me, is just one of the big downfalls of the house. Good luck to you, and we'll see you soon. Thank you. Alrighty. how are you guys holding up? We're tired. We're good. So, talk to us about your home. So you guys asked for candy and sweets, and we gave you candy and sweets. I love it. Our home is really an ode to all of these fun childhood candies that we grew up with while still making it festive for the holidays, right? Absolutely. With the interactive element, we made a beanbag toss game. I used to love that fruity, striped, flavored gum that lost its flavor in five minutes. Like, that's what that's an ode to do. Do you guys want to do a close-up inspection? I do. I need to. So, let's look. I think we need to look and play a little. Yes. that's a point! Okay, so overall, I love everything about this house. For your interactive element, I loved the candy toss. It's so cute. It's clever. That's great for kids to just come up to the house and play with that. One of the downfalls, for me ... I wish it was, like, slightly more holiday. You two ... I love this house. I feel like we told you we wanted it to be so sweet, it made our teeth hurt to look at it, and you took the opportunity to really make everything a confection, to give everything a little sprinkle of sugar. I love chalky pastels. I think they're beautiful, but I feel like that's where my eye's going, and it's a holiday house. You want to catch the eye, right? So I think the color palette, it's so soft that some of the great work is a little dampened. Thank you again, and good luck to you. Thank you. Thank you. Good luck. I have to say, that was a delicious stroll down sweet street. Don't you guys agree? Absolutely. Both teams, you both really wowed us with your holiday crafts, but unfortunately, only one team can win the sweet gift of $10,000 and the trophy, which is dripping in diamond dust. This was a truly difficult decision for these judges, but unfortunately, only one team can be crowned champion of "holiday crafters gone wild." and the winning team is... ...Sam and Charlotte. congratulations! Yes! I'm shocked. We are beyond thrilled, but we're also just proud that we did it. You guys just earned $10,000 and the holiday craft champions trophy. we feel so happy that we did weird, big, bold things, and ... and did what we love. You don't need to be a pro. You don't need to have a huge budget. You don't need to have giant craft stores to be the ultimate holiday crafter. Congratulations! Oh, my god, thank you!
