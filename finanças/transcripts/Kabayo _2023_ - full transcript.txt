Nightmare? Yup. My poor baby. Are you okay? I'm good. Oh shit. - I'm gonna be late again. - Stay here. Max will get mad at me again. Why? Let's do a quickie. Please. It'll give us good vibes. Before we... My brother knows that I'm the favorite daughter. So I always get what I want. Do you want me to call Max? I'll tell him that you have a stiff back. Please stop saying his name. Let's do it. Okay, okay. Hurry up. Let's be quick. The party is tonight, okay? What kind of party? Easton's welcome back party. He's back from New York. I'm busy tonight, babe. Huh? Why? All my friends will be attending. Is Wowee attending? He's the only one... of your friends that I'm close with. Really? You're gonna love Easton, promise. You already said that before. What? I'm getting close. Okay, go faster. I'm leaving, babe. I love you. See you tonight. Really? Timmy is absent. The deadline is today, okay? Why can't Gallardo do this instead? I still have a lot of deliverables. You can do it. Why are you late? You had sex with my sister? Nope. Don't lie. I doubt it. That girl's a slut. There's no assurance that if you make her happy that you're also making me happy. 5 PM on my desk. Sharp. Hi, babe. Sorry, I'm about to leave. Babe, hurry up! Easton is already here! Yeah, I know. I'm just finishing up this task that your brother gave me. We won't do it tonight if you won't hurry up! Forget about getting married, and having kids if you won't head here right now! Yeah, I'm leaving right now. Hurry up, babe! Leave your office! We're about to run out of alcohol! Okay, babe. Give me 20 minutes. What? No, come here now! I'm so close to getting wasted! Okay, okay. Ten minutes. Whatever! Bye! Hey, guys! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Shot! Woo! Party! Babe. Babe! Sorry, I'm late. I'll introduce you to Easton. He just arrived. - Easton! - Hey. Conrad, Easton. Easton, Conrad. Easton. Did you know that your girlfriend has been bragging about you since earlier? So the rumors are true. Sorry, babe. - What rumors? - Damn this tequila. I'm already drunk. I told him that you have a huge... - Sorry, babe. - She's been here since earlier. She was waiting for you. That's her second bottle. Why are you late? I haven't seen you around. Hi. I'm Mara. Conrad. This is my girlfriend. Don't mind these two. They're messing with all the guests around here. Sorry. What now? Are we just gonna stare at each other? - Shot! - Go, go. Normal isn't allowed here. Shot, babe! Shot, guys! Shot, shot! Shot, shot! [crowd cheering] - Thank you. - Laur. Laur. What's your bet? You think your brother will be rejected by Amy? Shut up. I believe in Max. - Sure? - Sure. Okay. Hassle. - Okay. - Shot. - Go, Laur. - Go, Laur. That's it? One more. One more. Let me show you how we do it in New York. Alright? Amy. Amy. Come here. Hi guys. Wait. Amy, lay down. Alright. - Take a bite. - Go, Amy. Salt. - Are you ready, Amy? - Go, Amy. Okay? - Go, Easton! - Go, babe! Okay. And the last part. - Pour that. - Wow. Yeah! Alright! So, Easton... are you back for good? Well... New York was great, but this is my home, man. And besides, my daddy needs me here. You've had a lot of women there, huh? Well it gets tiring. If women back there like you, they'll be the one to approach you. They really like our tan skin. Good thing I didn't allow Conrad to go back. Ladies there would have stolen him from me. I'm a good boy already. The gay community over there will love you. You're definitely their type. Strong, tan skin. So that's what they're into. Exotic. Really? Exotic? Oh, shot. Are we just gonna stare at each other? - Shot, shot. - Shot. - Guys... - Finish it. Shot, shot! What's this? Your dick is so huge. What can't it get up? I think I've done too much earlier. Are you dumb? Why are you talking back? I'm your master right now. Get it hard. Damn you. It's already hard. There. There you are. Ouch, Laurene. It hurts. Madam Trash! - Madam Trash. - Who's Laurene? Call me Madam Trash. Madam Trash. What's that? Say "I'm so stupid, Madam Trash!" I'm so stupid, Madam Trash! Are you mute? Louder! Madam Trash. You feel so good! Say "I'm dumb in the office and also in bed!" Wow. Wait, Laurene. Wait. Why? I'm not yet finished. What's the problem? - Your dirty talk is turning me off. - Shit. Sorry. What now? - Let's just rest for tonight. - What? Max, take care of that deal, okay? I'll take care of Iton Manuel. I can handle it. Hi, dad. Hi, grandpa, Hi, mom. Good morning. How's my beautiful daughter today? I'm fine. You seem to have stayed up late. - Hello, mom. - Good morning. Good morning, dear. You look blooming this morning. Thank you. - Did you get penetrated? - Mom. Grandma is wild. I thought Conrad was joining us. He had to work this weekend. Is it unpaid overtime again? Of course, that's his backlog which shouldn't be paid. You're too demanding. So... when are we gonna meet with Jacob? We're gonna have a merger with his IT company. Talk about it with your partner? Maybe? Stop it with your blind date suggestions. Jacob has his own successful company. Is it my fault that he's gorgeous? Besides, don't you want your own company? So you're saying that you'll give it to me but I have to date Jacob? My God. No way. Hey, everyone. Good morning. Good morning. - Hello. - Uncle, aunt, good morning. - This is my girlfriend Mara. - Good morning. You just came back and you already have a girlfriend? Easton, how's your stay in the US? Well, uncle, it was okay. It was fun. I just had to go home becauseI missed all of you. Really? Maybe Uncle Spanx just demanded that you return home. Well, that's one reason. Duty calls. Dad needed me here for our business expansion. Grab a plate. Regards to Spanx. Okay. Uncle... Can I talk to Laurene privately? We need to talk about something. Damn. Wasn't last night wild? It was lit. I know, right? It was too wild. My God, Laurene. Con was so drunk last night. Your boyfriend is a party animal. I know. Anyway, Mara bought a new house and she needs an interior designer. Who else came to my mind? Of course, it was you. He showed me your portfolio. - You're so talented. - Oh, thank you, love. The house is bare. Is it okay? Of course. Sure. Why not? So, we can set a dinner date? Or double date. Say yes. Con and I have already made plans for tonight. You know, quality time. You mean... sexy time? Yup. We didn't finish last night. Sexy time, quality time, next time. Yeah. Maybe next time. Thanks. Sir, one shot please. Hi. Am I a drink? No. Then why is it... that I'm already too wet? Why are you laughing? It's supposed to be sexy. Oh really? You should've briefed me with the timing. - Get ready. - Okay, okay. Game, game. I'll be serious this time. Okay. Again. Hi, are you alone? Well, thanks for the drink, but I already have a girlfriend. It's just a girlfriend. You're not yet married. I'm planning to marry her. Really? What if she declines? Why? Is she having second thoughts? I mean... maybe she wants to explore first. Does she want to explore some more? I want to explore... you. I'm not wearing panties. You don't have panties? Let's go. I'm gonna take this off. Get on your back. Be more quiet. Speak softer. I'm almost done, babe. Are you almost done? - Tell me when you're about to finish. - Okay. - I'm almost there. - Are you done? Go, cum for me. - Are you done? - Yes. I'm almost done. Don't move. This will only take a moment. Why? Babe! Wrong hole. Why? Don't go there. That's huge. But you're already done. - It won't fit. It'll hurt! - Why? Let me finish. Seriously? I can't take that. Please, baby. It's just for now. - Let me finish this. - No. I don't want to. Is it always gonna be like this? - No. - I'll always remain unfulfilled? No. It'll hurt. Come on. It hurts. Are you crazy? Somebody's outside. They caught up on us. Faster. Faster. - It's your fault. - Someone's outside. It's a quickie and yet I didn't get to finish. You're crazy! - Faster. - Please wait. We're good, we're good. Do you want me to get the toys out? Why don't you want children yet? Because we're not yet married. Aren't you the one who didn't want to get married? Have you already offered me a ring? Do you see anything? None, right? You know that my situation is difficult. It's too complicated. I'm not in a rush. Maybe that's what's missing. We need to have a baby, family. Our relationship has already reached seven years. Maybe we have to go to the next level. What if the ring comes afterwards? The proposal will happen first. The ring will come later on. Con, I love you. You know that I'm not ready, right? Everyone, I want you to meet our new creative director, Rain Buenasol. He's award-winning in his motors edge account. I've been working on his transfer to our company. You mean busy pirating me from my company? Since both Conrad and him are creative directors, we're gonna have a Team Conrad and Team Rain. And to welcome Rain, we're having drinks at Chile's tonight. This whole office is invited. Everyone should join. Conrad, come with us. Everyone will join, okay? Welcome, Rain. Okay. Sir. Thank you. Your house is beautiful, babe. We're gonna enhance it more. I'll come with you to the mall to buy stuff. Okay, sure. Conrad, I heard that you work in advertising. - Wrong topic. - What? Bad day at work? Don't we all go through that? That's always his rant. My brother. - Everyday. - Rant? Share it with us. Nevermind that. You'll just get bored. No. I insist. How will our night be nice if you're just gonna frown all night? Get your feelings out. Long story short. Laurene's brother is an asshole. He's Conrad's boss at the Ad agency. He's been an asshole since we were children. I also have a brother like that. - Asshole. - I know right. Conrad, I've always wanted to put up my own advertising agency. I just haven't found a great creative partner. - Really? - Yeah. Interested? Just hit me up. Wait. Are you pirating my brother's employee in front of me? - Really? Employee? - I'm just joking, babe. Your brother is a real asshole. Let's put it this way. If you're unhappy where you are, just leave. - Right, babe? - Yes. It's not that easy. Wrong. It's that easy. How long are you gonna slave yourself away? How long until you start following your own dreams? Didn't you fly back here because of your dad's family business? Oh, touche. Stop, babe. Careful with your words. Where's the restroom? I'll show you. Let's go. No. I'm good, bro. No, I insist. Come on. Let's go. How did you and Easton meet? Thanks, but you didn't need to come with me. It's okay. Anything else I can do to help you. Work, business, anything. - Just name it. - All good. I can also be your... sponsor. I'm just joking. I'll wait for you there. The food is delicious, right? I just had an idea. Why don't you visit the horse ranch in Talisay? It'll be fun. We can do a lot of things. Anything goes. - Really? Anything? - Yeah, anything. Babe, come with us. I can't. I have a Europe tour coming up. But Easton will take care of you. We have an agreement. I'm gonna miss you, babe. I'm gonna miss you too, babe. I'll take care of them, babe. Sure. Easton's life is so exciting, right? Why? Are you jealous? Don't tell me that you're not jealous. I'm happy with you alone. Really? Isn't being in a threesome your fantasy? It did cross my mind. Yeah. You complain that I always get my way. Why don't we try your fantasy? A threesome with a girl? Why not. Let's do your fantasy, and we'll do mine. That's fair, right? What's yours? Us with another guy. Like who? Easton? I don't know. Let's see. Two of us women, and you. You're too choosy, Conrad. Think about it, babe. Okay? I love you. I love you. Wow. It's so nice here, babe. Of course. Now that is a statement piece. It'll fit in your living room. Conrad is also a statement piece. You seem to make him happy for him to stay. Well, we met in college. We've been together for almost seven years. But of course, when you've been together for so long... What? You know, we were wilder in the past. Almost everyday, we made love. In the CR, auto, you know what I'm saying. It's normal for new couples. But after a while, spice it up. I think we've tried everything. Role-playing, BDSM. Conrad is open to these things. Like threesomes? Well, not that open. But of course when we first met, he thought I was an angel. He didn't know I was naughty. Threesomes are easy to setup if you like. - Really? - Yes. Easton's network is wide. Work hard, play harder, right? Hey, your hair looks good. Which salon do you go to? Can I touch it? Okay. It's so pretty. What? Are you two okay? It's like you're in a funeral. I know what you need. Shots. So, let's go. Game. There. Cheers. I found out online that anal orgasm is possible. Yup. I've had that a few times. - Really? Did it hurt? - Not if you do it right. You should be relaxed, with slow breathing, and most important, lots of lube. Lube? KY Jelly? Just anything to lubricate. Sometimes spit is enough. Who's your crush in the film? Angelica. She looks so innocent. Then the super sexy Ayanna Misola. Her boobs are too natural-looking. - Threesome with Ayana. Game? - Game. Okay. This is my strap-on dildo. It's so huge and also black. So he was on his back, while I was wearing my strap-on dildo. When I was about to insert my dick inside him, in doggy style, he suddenly faced me. He asked me if I put it inside him, does it mean that he's gay? I was dumbfounded. It was crazy. That was the best sex in my life. But after that, I never met him again. Why? I was developing feelings. Wait. Ladies room. Cheers. Oh, shit! Babe. Why? I'm late for my pitch. You want me to call Max? No. Fuck that. I need to go. - Thank you, Ma'am. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. We look forward to working with you, sir. Take care. Max, sorry I'm late. I just had an emergency. It's okay, bro. Don't be sorry. We won the account. What? Really? I should really thank you. Rain lead the presentation. He was so good. But that was my pitch, wasn't it? It isn't my fault that you weren't around. Rain will replace you as lead, okay? Sorry, bro. What? I won't allow it. I worked for it, right? It's done, bro. Damn. - Where are you? - Bar. Why? I lost the account to Rain. My poor baby, I'm sorry. We shouldn't have done the threesome. Why did you even think of it? Are you blaming me for this? You wanted that too. Hi Amy, are you out? - So where's Laurene? - She's not here. Does she know that we're here? Amy, eat me. Come on. Suck me. Harder! Deeper! Wait, easy. Sorry, sorry. Okay. Go. Suck it good. Almost there. Almost there. Here it comes. I'm cumming. I'm cumming, Amy. Sorry, sorry. I have to go. I need to leave. Sorry, sorry. I have to go. Please don't mention this to Laurene, okay? - Hey, pretty girl. How are you? - Hey. I'm fine. Hi, babe. How are you? I'm okay. Guys, we're friends, right? I'm here to talk about business. Is there a problem? Easton, are you serious with the ad agency offer with Con? Of course. Why? Is Con okay? Well... me and Conrad aren't in good terms lately. We haven't talked these past few days. I see. Bedroom disagreements? No. You know that I'll do anything for Con, right? Can you help me with that? Anytime. I'm gonna show you a secret. I love secrets. Surprise! Welcome to my little hideout. Wow. Laur... I didn't expect this. You naughty girl. Now my secret has been revealed. Such a naughty girl. Hello? Conrad? Who's this? It's Easton. Hey, what's up? - Are you free later? - For what? Let's meet. Bring your materials and your pitch, I want to see your stuff. You mean for your agency? Okay. I'll bring everything. Alright then. Great! See you later! Okay. Well, for the last few months, their VP has been tracking the millions. Impressive. Well, if you don't mind, how much is your current salary? I'm still in the mid level. What? Mid level? You are undervalued. I wanna show you something. Here. That's my offer. Wow, are you serious? This will change everything. Well that's the plan. I have full creative controls? As long as the clients are happy, we have full control. But... why me? You know, Conrad. Ever since I came back here, you're the only one who wasn't fake towards me. You're real. And I like that. You know that I can't tell lies. I know. And I also believe that you wouldn't let this partnership go. And besides, I want to get to know you more. Our lead generation is tracking high, low bounce rate, 83 percent CTR and 20 percent conversion rate. Impressive. Good enough. Of course, it wouldn't have been possible without Rain. You might've found a new favorite. Maybe Conrad can already get pirated. Why? Are there other offers? We have a potential client. Beauty product line. Amy San Diego. You know her, right? Yup. We've met at Easton's party. I told her that you were fully booked, that's why I referred her to Rain. What? Speaking of the devil... Rain? - Did you invite him? - It's okay. I got this. Sit down. Sit. You know my sister, Laurene. Of course, this is Conrad. Hi. Max speaks so much about you. Well you're even prettier in person. Thank you. Damn you. Don't mind my brother. I heard you did well for the happy sponge account. Well the client loved it. Of course, it was the keyword generation, and the SEO that made it successful. Which I made. You made it, but you weren't present in the pitching. Both of us were there. It's good. But you know what? I need to make some minor adjustments. Really? I've seen your marketing page and landing funnel. I can easily add five, or six more points to the CTR and UTV. If that was me. Really? Okay, fine. Can you share us one of your award-winning ideas? Oh that's right. You don't have any awards. Guys, chill. Chill. Why did you assign him to the Amy San Diego account? Isn't it that Amy requested for me? Why? Are you dating Amy? Guys, chill. I invited both of you here, because we have a team building next week, right? I want you to be friends, okay? - Enjoy your lunch. - Babe. Babe, wait. Babe. Babe. Babe. Babe! Conrad! That asshole is so overboard! He thinks he's better than everyone! Babe, take it easy. Let's go back inside. Do you want me to go back there? You don't know how disrespectful he is! He's your brother! That's why I don't tell you everything. I know. I know, he's an asshole at times but he's a good guy overall. He's an asshole! He's not kind! Stop making excuses for that asshole! If you're gonna pick him, then stay together. Both of you are assholes! Hey. I'm sorry about what happened earlier. You know your brother. I didn't know that Con was coming. It's okay. You know what, Laurene, you're beautiful. And the way you handled the situation earlier, I can see that you are a mature woman. What? You don't even know me. If you allow me, I want to know you better. No. I want to see you again. You are an Uytingco. I am a Buenasol. - We're a match. - I'm sorry. Your place is so nice. Thanks. Why are you here, Laur? Like I said I wanted to give you free design advice. Laur, are you okay? Is there a problem? You seem a bit off. Off? No. I'm okay. Really? Conrad is more straightforward. Conrad? Did Conrad visit here? Not here. At the hotel. What did you two do? - Did you... - Oh no, no. We didn't do it. More like he fucked my mouth. Anyway, we've been together before, but he hasn't done that to me before. - It was kinda hot. - Are you into that? Sometimes. What's the problem, Laur? It's Conrad. Okay. Spill it out. Where have you been? Sorry. My friend and I didn't notice the time. Who? Amy. Amy? Then what happened? Nothing. Girl talk. I don't believe you. Don't believe me then. I'm tired. I'm really sleepy. I'm gonna sleep. Wait. You're telling me that you went to Amy, until late hours and were talking, but nothing happened? None. Why are you so suspicious? Bullshit. What difference does it make if there was? She's a woman. Didn't you put your dick inside her before? Right? Right? So what? My point is that you didn't ask my permission for you to go out. Didn't you two talk last week? You told her that you're having problems. That's why she visited you for you to talk, right? Is that all? I'm tired. I'm really sleepy. Alright. Congratulations. The moment we've all been waiting for... The battle of Art directors. Boss Conrad! It's still a bottle flip challenge. If Team Rain wins, I'll give a 50 thousand bonus. If Team Conrad wins, it's doubled to 100k. - Let's go, let's go. - That's crazy. Okay, let's start. Ready, go! - Team Conrad! - Go, Team Rain! - Team Conrad! - Go, Team Rain! [crowd cheering] Go on. Try harder. Go, a little bit more. Just a little bit. Give it up. [crowd cheering] And the winner is... Team Rain! What now? 100 thousand was wasted. What a waste. Your team leader failed all of you. Failure! Sorry, guys. Sorry. Damn you. I'm tired of your games. Are you okay? Damn you! Asshole! I heard that you punched my brother. I heard that you punched my brother. Wtf, Con. Why? What's up? I want you to meet our first potential client. Hey, man. Chill. We still have a meeting with a client. Why did you punch him? What? Laur just informed me. She's freaking out, dude. He's a real asshole. That's nothing new to you, right? Why did you even wait this long? It was just a stupid game. But I was really mad. I'm not sure what happened. You lost control, right? You were too nice before. You let them use you. You let them walk all over you. My whole life, I've been a victim. What's even my fault? I don't even do bad deeds. I know. There are only few people like you. Handsome, hunky, and full of talent. They're intimidated by you. People like you, are the ones that they try to bring down. I didn't do anything wrong. I don't even like hurting people. But I had no choice. With the rage I felt I wanted to... Hey, hey. Chill. I feel you. Relax. I see that you're a good person. I see you for who you are. You just want to love and be happy. You just wanna stop hurting, right? You're tired of being angry. Anyway, who is our first client? You wanna meet her? - Let's go. - Alright let's go. Cheers. Bottom's up, dude. - Amy? - Come in. Come. So you've met each other? A little bit at your party. A few more times after. So you're our first client? Amy is the owner of many companies. She wants to rebrand. Okay, cool. Okay, look. I know everything. It's okay. What everything? Who among you and Laurene did you think was hooking up with Amy? I'm serious with business, Conrad. I'm very demanding. I'm a boss everyday. But in some days, I just want to get dominated. To be abused. Can you abuse me, Conrad? Easton? Conrad, nobody said that business can't go well with pleasure. No one. Okay. Good morning. Breakfast for my baby. Wow. That's so early. Here you go. Thank you. What's happening? Why did you make breakfast? Because today is the day that I quit my job. Oh, good. Are we celebrating tonight? Aren't you disappointed that I'm leaving your brother's agency? Who cares? Wherever you're happy, I'm happy too. Babe, I'm so excited for you. Yeah, I think the... We feel like our wave of numbers here are high... We also have a score that's... What do you think? Is there something wrong? - Wait, Amy... - Sorry. It's not for me. Wait. Is there a problem? Conrad? See you soon. I guess. Hey. Why were you absent? Did you know that we failed to close the Amy San Diego account because you're always absent? I've already filed my resignation letter. You're here because of my sister. You're aware of that, right? Where will you be transferring? I have an offer somewhere else. Offer? What offer? Did you have sex with the CEO's sister? For you to have an offer? We all know that you weren't able to book Amy's account, because your pitch sucked. And also, everyone in this office knows, that your dick is tiny. So you overcompensate to look cool and seem masculine. But guess what, Max? Amy enjoyed my pitch, and also enjoyed me. What? That's the first thing I'm gonna steal from this office. And for this to be official, Max. Damn you, asshole. I quit! What is everyone looking at? Back to work! Damn you. Damn, bro! Damn. You said all that? Screw him. He's an asshole. Look, dude. Seriously I am very happy for you because when I first met you, you never stood up for yourself. But now, look at you. I'm so proud of you, now you're really happy. I wouldn't have done that without your help. You exerted the effort, man. You did everything by yourself and you deserve it. No. Seriously it was all you. If you never put your trust in me, I'm really sure that I wouldn't know where to pull strength from. I'm still shocked. I really said that to Max. In front of the whole office. Damn. I'm so excited for the beginning of our new agency. - Cheers. - Cheers. To our new agency. To Digital Mark. We're gonna target all of Max's clients. We're gonna steal all of his clients. Even all of the pretty women. That's dangerous. You're dead if Laur finds out you got someone pregnant. I'll be busted. I'll get someone pregnant then. Let's press release that you're the biological father. Will that be okay with you? It's okay as long as we both take care of the child together. That would work. So this agency is like our baby. Then we're the parents. So what are we? Lovers? A couple? What? Damn. Sorry, sorry. It's okay. Well, this is not the first time that a guy attempted to flirt with me. I just don't want you to think that I'm doing all of this because I like you. I really like you. But of course, business first. I believe in your abilities. That's what I hold on to. Thank you, Easton. Cheers. Are you Ma'am Laurene? - Sir, thank you. - Sure. Babe. Easton seems to be serious with his offer. The agency offer? Yes, what's the update regarding that? It's still gonna push through. But? I think Easton wants to do me. How did you come to that conclusion? I think Easton is bisexual. I'm not surprised. Easton has always been bisexual? - Why didn't you tell me? - How would I bring that up? What should I have said? Like "Hey, babe. Easton is interested in your dick." Like that? I don't have a problem with bisexuals. What's the problem? Maybe he wants to try me? Babe, if Easton likes you, I'm sure that he sees something in you. And whatever he sees in you, I've already seen way back. You're a very talented person. Your talents should be recognized worldwide. Okay. Are you done with that? Not yet. I'm about to finish. - Hey, what's up? - What's up? How are you? Okay, okay. Hey, pretty. Here it is. Welcome to Hacienda Verde. It's so beautiful here, Tons. Of course. You know, everytime that I want to hide from the world, I always come here. It's beautiful and peaceful here. Besides, the land area here is huge. No one is here. We're allowed to do anything. Guys, have you had your breakfast? Not yet. Let's go. I thought you guys wouldn't come. This is the farm that I was talking about. We can wander around. We can go anywhere. Actually, we can do a lot of activities here. That's Marvel. Our star horse. Handsome. Has he been here long? He's been here a long time. The tourists here love him. This horse is really kind. We never had a problem with him. He's very well taken care of. He is given all the luxuries. Trainers love him. He follows all commands. Let's come closer. Hey, Marvel. Marvel. Admiring the view? - Am I too obvious? - It's okay to look. I'm not selfish. - Are only looks allowed? - Easton, behave. What? Can you blame me? Look at him. But I'm serious, Tons. I'm not selfish. Meaning? Don't fool me. I'm not stupid. But Tons, promise me that you won't make him your toy, okay? - Of course, Laur. - Or else, I wil destroy you. Destroy me now. I had fun today. What are doing tomorrow? A lot. But drinking is forbidden. Boo. We almost cancelled. Oh, really? Why? What happened? Should I spill it? Laur, really? Conrad is worrying that you seem to wanna taste him. Laur, Jesus Christ. Laur, I didn't say anything like that. No. I had to say it. If we don't talk about this today, then when? Sorry, Easton. I did not say that. I didn't say that. You did! Didn't you say that you were worried? We talked about this. Right, Easton? Tell him. It's okay. This is also my fault. Conrad, I admit. You're handsome, smart, and hunky. Only someone stupid wouldn't fall for you. But for me, business is business. The main reason why you are here is because you have a creative mind. You're skilled. And for me, this is just work. That's what's important to me. So this is all just business? Well, I'm sorry Conrad that those unexpected events happened, like that with Amy, you, and me. I shouldn't have let it get that far. I'm sorry. It's okay, babe. You knew? About what? Your threesome? Yes. Who told you? Easton, Amy, it doesn't matter. I'd be mad if it were strangers. It's just Easton, right? It's nice to get it off your chest, right? Is everything resolved? Are we good? Can we enjoy? Alright. So let's cheers to that. Hey, what's up? Did you know that a gay guy courted me previously? He was nice. Very generous. I accepted all of his gifts. Dinner dates, money, material things. But there was no sexual intercourse. I limited us to only friends. It lasted for a year. But one day, he asked me if we could be more. I said that I wasn't gay. He got mad. He told me that I wasted all of his efforts. But I felt guilty because... I felt the pain that he was feeling afterwards. I love Laurene, but I feel safe with you. I can't explain it. It feels weird. I'm just sure that... I feel so at peace when I'm with you. You knew from the very start that I'm not gay. I am bisexual. It's different. Why? Are you confused? Yes, with you. I'm so confused. I cannot do this. Give me some time. Give me some time to think. Good morning to my favorite couple. I slept really well. Nice. How about you, Conrad? Did you sleep well? I slept really well. Well, eat up. We have a lot of activities today. What do you guys want to do? Trail, hiking, we can also do KTV. Anything. Just tell me. She's a very good singer. Really? I want to try. Can we, Conrad? I guess. I love it. There. Let's finish the food. This will give us energy. Our family had a lot of businesses before. But Yolanda destroyed everything. The flood was so high. It was up to our roof. We thought we wouldn't be affected. But the water was so deep. I didn't know that it would burden us. I found my mother's corpse on the field. I was the one who closed her eyes. Sorry to hear that, though. I was the breadwinner of my family. I did everything to raise my siblings. I tried everything. I sold stuff on the streets and on the market. You know, Conrad rarely opens up about Yolanda. It's just now. - I love you, babe. - Love you. Hey. What's that? Tons, do you wanna sit here? No, I'm good. I saw both of you earlier. What? It's just now that I saw you with extreme happiness. - It's vague but... - How did you see us? I got jealous. Why did you get jealous? What are you saying? Maybe it's your imagination. I'm not dumb, dude. I admit. Conrad and I haven't been good lately. Part of me is happy seeing him like that. So what now? - What? - What? What's our plan? We're just gonna stare at each other? I don't know. Easton, help me. What? Come on, babe. I want to see both of you. Lie down. Suck my dick. What? What did you say? - Damn! - What's your problem? What am I to you? Are you just using me? Like a damn dildo? - Con, it's not like that. - Don't touch me. Everything that I do is for us. Easton and I have a lot of plans for you. Easton's plan for me? That's not how it sounds. So this was all a big plan. And everything that you said was all bullshit. Con, everything I said was real. And all of my plans are for you. Damn you! Damn you too! You're a match. Stay together, assholes! Con. Sorry about last night. I've made mistakes but I want you to know that... I don't wanna talk about it. I was serious with our business plan. Please take time to rethink. Please. I'm leaving. I need some time to think. This is all my fault. Stop it. You were perfect. We just need to settle some things. I wish we can still fix this. Thank you. Sometimes I forget that you're handsome. Because I got used to having you around. But you already know, right? That I'll never give up on you? Hey, Mr. President CEO. Congrats on the Ligato deal. Was it the fifth closed deal for the last two months? You just assembled a great team. I'm just guiding them. Humble brag. Anyway, you wanna celebrate that tonight? My treat. Thanks, but I have a date with Laurene. And by the way, please tell everyone that lunch is on me. Right. So see you then? - See you. - Right. Nice ring. Thanks. Your fiance seems to be wealthy. CEO. I have an offer. Remove that ring just for tonight, and I'll give you 100 thousand pesos. Only 100 thousand pesos? 100 thousand, cold cash per pop. What's your other offer? I also have a good friend and he really wants to meet you. - Hi. - Hi. He also offers the same rate. 100 thousand. How many rounds can you do? I can do five. Same. Cheers. Well I think you're not at a loss with that offer, and besides I'm sure, we're all gonna enjoy. So, what's the plan? Game? Your offer seems to be inadequate. Whatever your heart desires. Whatever it is, name it. I want both of you to pop it inside me at the same time. Wherever it is.
