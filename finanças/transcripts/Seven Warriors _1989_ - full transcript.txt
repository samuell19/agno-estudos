In the 1920s, China was divided by warlord regimes, and suffered from civil wars. Many defeated soldiers, as a result, became homeless and then turned bandits that were bound to commit robberies and rapes and so forth. People found it hard to tell good from bad, and bad from good. Those poor, innocent peasants too weak to fight against were inevitably put to misery! Over here! - Over there! - Yes, sir... Move it! - Go check over there! - Yes, sir! Over there! Or I'll blow you head. Are you going to speak or not? Ok, I'll speak! Hung shi-Jin taught us that "unity is strength‚Äù and that we should go up against you... - Where is he now? - Behind the hills Sis, are you alright? Hurry! Sis? Get on the horse now! No! I want to go with you! - I said get on the horse! - No! You go first! No! Either we go together or I won't go. - I am not leaving you! - Go or you'll die! Stay right there! Go! Anyone who goes against us is dead meat! We're here to offer you protection! We're the farmer's protection army This man is possessed by devil mistaking us as bandits so our leader had to shoot him dead, display his brunt corpse. Don't you ever take him as an example or you would die a hard death! As for that escaped village girl, our leader said... Those who let her take shelter is doomed! Get lost! Don't you want to live? Get lost! Continue your farming work... We'll meet again during harvest! Go! Rebel! That's what's to be done! Rebel? Can't you see how shi-Jin ended up dead? All because their rebellious attempt! They've brunt our village to the ground! That was because you haven't sought help! Help? From where? Where comes the money needed? We can hardly feed ourselves, let alone paying for help. I don't think everyone is for the money! Why if not for the money? I've seen a lot more than you did. You might as well save it. We are no match to them. Madam ping... no... I want you dead! How can you feel the pain? - Please don't... - Let go of me! What about your "no rabel" talk now? Till then, let the bandits burn your own house kill your own children and rape your own wife what venomous tongue! When did you women started to have a say? Head of the village, sir, those bandits are cold-blooded. They burnt my husband to death last year. How could you forget so soon? Remember how you become crippled? Remember how your wife die? You couldn't even bury your father intact! Have you really forgotten it all? If we swallow it, our children's children would be living under their shadow! Sir, these are not much but all I can give for the cause... If only we all donate our pin money! We can surely find someone to help! Look! Madam ping is a widow and she's willing to give her money for the village's good. Let me go to the city with your money or help! - We'll be back in no time! - Bye, mom! Madam ping, I'll take good care of your son. Want some hats? What are you looking at? Haven't you seen a bike before? Come take a look! How about a pistol? 50 coins. Made in Germany. Good stuff! How about 407? Would I interested you with 30 coins? What? Master Jin is looking for a bodyguard. He's offering 30 coins a month. For those who could endure three punches, noodles are served. For those who couldn't, please see yourselves out. Someone take him out. Is there no one else? Here... Get ready Not even close. Go on. Stop! Give way! What kind of test is this? Even the able would be disabled... Look, look at yourselves! How could you call yourselves Chinese when you'd be humiliated for money? These rough tyrants only know bullying. Why are you working for them? We Chinese... Should sacrifice ourselves for the nation's sake. - Fix him! - Yes, sirl... Over there! Freeze! Don't go! You've broke my stall. Now you want my rod? Stop! Get out... Want to play? We'll die together if anyone fights again. Go! Blow up... - Let's split! - Hero! - What's the matter? - Wait a moment! Call me wong way-wu! Way stand for might, wu stand for power! I hate those who Rob the poor people. - Please help me! - Find another one! It's the responsibility of youths like us... To save the ordinary people from troubles. They are in trouble but you don't help them. You're so cruel. I'm not made for fighting robbers. It is just a waste. Is it right? You're chicken shit if you said so! I don't fight a losing battle. - Hero... - Let him go! Count on me! There're 400 million Chinese. We'll find help anyway? But half the population had turned to robbery! Have some tea... - I don't think so! - Will you help us? We soldiers have duty to help people! People are moved by my righteous look. But our group is too small. We have to find more people. - Good idea! - How much money do you have? I've only got ten dollars or so! Give me! I got a few cents too! We can find people for help than! Thank you... No need to worry! Hay, where will we meet again? Chase them! Don't go! Uncle au! Uncle au! It's cold! Come on! Mouse-meat and bone of cat! We didn't catch a single mouse.

I'll find him! - Where to find? - Search everywhere! - Harvest! - Uncle au! Are you alright? I'm alright! I've meet uncle Yung. - He promised us to fight the robbers. - Really? I'll be a winged tiger with his help! You couldn't even catch two thugs. How could you fight against robbers? You can help us with your kung-fu. Your kung-fu is a bit worse! But we don't mind! If I cannot get back the money. I won't be called way-wul! Wu! How many robbers are there? Who's the leader? Hundreds or more! The leader is piu! Piu? He's a tough one!

I'll do it voluntarily! - No payment! - I do without payment! Fight the robbers! Are you joking? Fight with four guns only? Yes! It's a difficult task! Anyway, count me in! I'll be right back! What is the treasury? Ming or sung? Ching is equally good! - I tell you... - I know... volunteer! No reward! Okay! He looked silly but he survived several great battles. He's really something. The greatest trouble-maker is now outside. Go settle him! - Ching! - Commander. Is he giving your trouble? I'll get rid of him! No, he'll fight the robbers with us. He's a miser. How will he help us? I don't believe that! Let me kill him! Release me... it's no fun! I won't go with him. - Ghost! - I won't go... Ching, you're a military school officer at nanking! Why comes to this place of poverty? Sir, my dad told me to follow you. His letter. Your dad told me to kick you back! You've saved me once! I must pay it back! It's ordinary in battle! You don't owe me anything. You help them. I help you! 1,2,3,4,5. One more to go if uncle ghost will help us! We'll set off early next morning! Just pretend that I didn't read this letter. Thank you, sir! Let's go, everybody! Yes! Havest.

Silence! Alert! Get up! - Fall in! - Line up... Hurry! Line up... No way! - Attention! - No. You no need to fight, line up. Fire! Why doesn't it work? Au! Polish these knives. Yes, commander! I've said that we'd lose. If we fight, we'll have a chance to win. We'll solve the shortage of weapons. From now on, I'm your training officer. Obedience is the first rule of war! Do you know? - Yes, sirl... - Louder! - Say again! - Yes, sirl... Here we are! Here the village entrance, let's go in! Loosen up or it won't blast. 2... 3... 4...1 Can you see?

If the robbers attack from our back. This forest will give them a good lesson. I agree... - You mean... - Miner! Had the powder made by the peasants been tested? Not yet! This village is beautiful. It's a waste to let the robbers destroy it. Master! I've torn down the robber's flag. Put it back now! - What? - Yung is right! Don't make them suspicious! Put it back at once! - Hurry up! - Go!

Are you one of the robbers? - No... - She's on our side! Don't listen to them till they're settled down. I know you! You're a robber! No, I am not really! I'll shoot you if you don't tell the truth. Hang... no... we know her... She's from the nearby village! Robbers killed her brother. It's you who the robbers were looking for! You'll bring us trouble if you stay! Hang, where can she go to? I don't care! Those robbers had said, those who let her take shelter is doomed! - Is it true? - Yes... get her out! - This girl... - Go away! - I want her to stay! - Go away! He hits Mel... We should accept her, shouldn't we? Wu! - Am I wrong? - Keep quiet! She had helped us before. We're outsiders anyway. - You're the one to make decision. - Master! She belongs on our village! She can stay! Mrs ping, be reasonable please! I'm a widow! I need a helping hand. Now I adopt her as my daughter. How can you do that? Harvest is near! I want her help! - Chiefl! - Hang. Be reasonable! They're right. Just let her stay! Have you heard it! Give me the gun! Go! You're a excellent chief. It's really a difficult task! The harvest seemed to be good this year! Yes!

Chi, you appeared at last! Long time no see! I know you're here! It's good! Right, we didn't met for a long time! Four years nearly! Time is running fast! Piu, what a coincidence? I am no sweet talker. My flag was erected here. I'll give you a share after the harvest. Then what about my brothers? Seven parts? No way! Please don't be cruel to these peasants. Both of us shouldn't take it. Then what can we live on? These peasants should serve us! Or they won't be called serfs. The difference between the peasants and us is that we have guns! Yes, because we have guns, we can be the leader. You don't have to help those serfs. You bastard, we've got guns too. We've become strangers to each other after these years. You knew me very well before! You knew me well too. Okay, today is for us to know each other! We'll leave! The boundary of the village is too large! We should concentrate inside the village. House at forest, farmland and river, we cannot reach for. There will be no protection. You know that house is mine so you don't protect it. You do this because I refused to fight. Hang, our army is really too small. You're playing trick! I step back, it's just for safety sake! We can build you another house later. Yes, we can build you another house! Yes, let's settle this way. Do the other way round! Would you just protect my houses and just forget the rest. Do you agree? - You fool! - You're fool! I don't want to say in the beginning. - Hang. - They won't admit it. But I can see. They behaved... Like good friends. They knew each other before. You can't cheat me? I'm not that foolish. Fight yourself! I won't go! Let's go! Hang, don't go! Stand there! Don't go! It's an command! We go back to pack things up! Go! It's beautiful! - It's for you! - I like it very much! I know what you mean, but, man don't like getting success too easily, or it won't last long. Think it over! No need to hurry! Thank you for your consideration! I am on duty. Do you feel bored? I can stay with you! Back to sleep! She's Yung's wife. Isn't she beautiful? It's none of my business. Yung have wife? She was dead already. Dead? Yung loved her very much. He won't marry again. He's really a great lover. So are you! Yung said you fought bravely to get those money back from the robbers. Really? Stars are pretty tonight! Let's walk over there. Come on! Wu, today those robbers had gone. But they'll return soon. So we still have chance for revenge. Would you stay after our victory? No, I was a born wanderer. - Man is for everywhere. - So am I! Good! Do you know the name of that star? 70% for me and 30% for you, agree? Fifty fifty and no argue! Throw over there! Let Mel... We're rich! Ghost, you greed's going to kill you. You promise to let me go. After I framed ghost? - Really? - Don't break your promise! Yung! Why don't you sleep? I bring it back to you! Sorry! I misunderstood you. Don't be silly! Just joking! I haven't dated girls before! This is my first time! Be careful! It's troublesome! Yes, it'll tie you up like a snake. Yung... - What is it? - Something wrong happened. Come on! When two tigers fight, only one survives. I give you face by not killing him. You'll be all dead and my men half gone. Not economical! You and ghost are my friends! I don't want to hurt our friendship. Why do you stick with those serfs? Listen to me! These slush will betray you at anytime! - Does it hurt? - No... Does he worth your help? - Hang! - No, please! He betrayed you! I shoot him for you! Stop! You'll lose certainly if we start the battle. And I won't get any benefit! Release ghost and hang first! Hang... Chi, make up your mind! Take them out! Go! Hurry up! You're controlling their lives! - We leave! - Leave? - Release him! - Go! Go! Wu! - Ching-ching! - Wu! - We've found the village girl! - Wu... Leave her alone! Leave her? We've been looking for her! Kill her! Release her or I'll kill all of you! I'll chop you up if you shoot. Clam down! Piu, don't go too far! It's your woman! Take her! Ok! Let's go! Commander! Commander! Don't go! Into the village! Yung! It's almost a time. Good! Help! Help! Watch out! - Help! - Shut up! - Mom, I'm scared! - Shut up! Mrs ping, it's mine! All are here. Follow me! Help... don't! Help... What are you doing? Do you know how my wife died? - I want to piss. - You have a lot of urine! Commander! Ching! Piu will attack from the front! Wu, go to help ching! We should concentrate here! No problem! We'll be alright! Listen all of you! Don't shoot without my order. Yes, sir! Don't be too restless. Shoot precisely. Don't waste bullets! Ready! The cane farm is easily penetrated by robbers! This hidden place is made for ghost. Au, go with him! He goes with me! It's your luck! Spread out! Enemy will attack the main gate. Gun fire won't work here! Enemy will send the big-swords. Mao, how many people do you need? Mines are enough for the forest! - Yung! Handle it! - Yes! Karl, you take care of the village's safety. Yes! Commander, I can handle myself! Wait for the target! - Draw back! - Why so premature? Draw back! Hurry upl! Forward! Go! Mao had fought away robbers attacking from the back. We in the front can't stand too long! The robbers' fire power is very strong! What should we do? Tell ching to pull back. Yes, commander! Cane farm Go! Enough... hide away! This place is easy to guard. Stay here! I go to see those guys! Okay, don't worry! I go now! Piu is not at the back. He must be at the front. Hurry upl! Fire! I cover you! Be careful! One bullet for one. Don't be afraid! Damn it! - What's the situation? - We can stand it! Commander! You should at the farm! Why are you here? Au is enough for the farm! Here is more important.
