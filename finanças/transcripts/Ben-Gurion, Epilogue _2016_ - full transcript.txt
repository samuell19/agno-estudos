Recording the Ben-Gurion interview at Sde Boker, Israel, 24 frames... ﻿In April 1968 David Ben-Gurion agreed to give a filmed interview ﻿to a British film crew that built an elaborate film set near his desert home. ﻿The interview with the leader who declared the establishment of the Jewish State in 1948 ﻿and served as its prime minister for 13 years, ﻿took place when he was 82 years old, ﻿five years after he suddenly resigned from the government. ﻿We happened to find the interview in the Spielberg Archive in Jerusalem ﻿which we came to in order to restore a feature film ﻿on the life of David Ben-Gurion produced in the late 60's. ﻿To our surprise, next to it we found a pile of 35 mm film reels including his unknown interview with Ben-Gurion. ﻿The interview is 6 hours long, and we found out ﻿that it was used for research for the screenplay of the feature film. ﻿Unfortunately, the soundtrack was lost and the image remained silent. ﻿The search for the lost soundtrack ﻿led us to the Ben-Gurion Archive in the Negev. ﻿There, an 86-year-old British Jew ﻿who served as soundman for the interview, ﻿had deposited the original sound reels a few years ago ﻿without knowing where the silent video portion of the interview was. ﻿Thus, in this film, for the first time is revealed ﻿a long, intimate, rare interview with David Ben-Gurion. ﻿The interviewer is a young American Jew, ﻿Dr. Clinton Bailey, ﻿who came to Israel and, following Ben-Gurion's example, settled in the desert. ﻿The interview was conducted just four months after his wife Paula's death. ﻿Ben-Gurion lives alone with his bodyguards ﻿in his desert home. ﻿Mr. Ben-Gurion? ﻿Yes, please. ﻿What do you do with your tin^.e nowadays? ﻿You see, I left the Government, in 1963, for a single puripese. ﻿To write the history... ﻿of the remaking of the Jewish State. ﻿Which I regard began not in May 1948, ﻿but in 1870 ﻿How long will that take you? ﻿Another six or eight years. ﻿Do you have faith that you will be able to do it? ﻿It's possible, but I'm not certain. ﻿Tomorrow there may be some accident, and I am finished. ﻿Almost every day I hear there is an accident. ﻿People are being killed. ﻿But, in general, you don't fear death? ﻿Will it help me if I do fear? Why should I fear? ﻿It will not change anything. ﻿How did your Zionism come to you when you were a young man? ﻿First of all, they came to my father. ﻿And, it all began in... Plonsk (Poland)... ﻿I didn't like that life at all. ﻿What, were the 'things you liked to do as a child? ﻿I liked'to read'. ﻿I read Uncle Tom's Cabin when I was'about eight/years old. ﻿I admired that there is such a person like Tom, ﻿and such a great man, although he is a slave, ﻿and I was astonished that there are people who have slaves ﻿and misuse them. ﻿Because there are terrible stories there in that book. ﻿When you got your Zionism at a young age ﻿it came with a lot of dedication. - I was very young. ﻿When Herzl appeared in our little town they said: Messiah's come. ﻿And I believed it. ﻿He was a very beautiful person ﻿with a large, long, black beard. ﻿What did you expect when you came to... ﻿What shall we call it, Palestine or The Land? ﻿Eretz Israel. ﻿Well, it depends on what point of view. ﻿From a Jewish point of view, there were very few Jewish settlements. ﻿Many came, but, almost the same day ﻿or a week later, they left again. ﻿Very few remained. ﻿This is before the First World War. ﻿There was complete anarchy in the country. ﻿One village was fighting with the other. ﻿My ideal was to work on the land. ﻿I saw every day, thousands of Arab workers, are coming, ﻿and going straight to work ﻿A Jew must stand near the synagogue. ﻿The farmer came and looked at his... ﻿Muscles. ﻿And he choose one worker. ﻿And it took me ten days until I got the first day of work. ﻿But, then I got malaria. At night it was terrible. ﻿I couldn't work, ﻿I ﻿couldn't eat. ﻿I wrote eve'ry week, two, three letters to my father, ﻿describing the:country. ﻿so he thought I am happy. ﻿But there were many people from my town, ﻿and they were going and coming back ﻿and they told my father how am I living. ﻿When he heard that he sent me a letter: ﻿"Come back!" ﻿So I understood that he learned... ﻿They have told him... ﻿I sent him a letter, "Aba...", Aba means Father... ﻿"You know I will not leave this country." ﻿So it strikes me that in those early years of yours ﻿you were a rebel, ﻿you were not ready to accept the normal life, ﻿the conformist life, you were against it... ﻿What is normal life? ﻿The normal life was abnormal life... ﻿We wanted to create a new life. ﻿Not the life which exists. ﻿I believed that we had a right to this country. ﻿Not taking away from others, but recreating it. ﻿So when did I reach the ideal to create everything from the beginning? ﻿Only fourteen years ago. ﻿I once came back from Eilat (southern border of Israel). ﻿And suddenly I see there are some young people, a few huts, ﻿so I left my car and I went down, I said: "What are you doing here"? ﻿They told me, "We were fighting the War of Independence in this place." ﻿Here I saw that that dream can become a fact. ﻿And I decided, although I was then prime minister ﻿and minister of defense, ﻿I decided to join them, to start building up, ﻿in the desert, where there is no soil, no water, no grass, no rain... ﻿So you mean to tell me, that only fourteen years ago... ﻿Beginning... -That's it! -Your dream.. ﻿That's it! That's it! ﻿Create everything from the beginning, because until then it was impossible. ﻿Mr. Chairman, Knesset members, it is my duty to inform you on behalf of the government ﻿that unfortunately Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion ﻿announced yesterday at the government meeting ﻿that he has decided to resign as prime minister and defense minister. ﻿Solitude... -Yes? ﻿Has... played a great role in your life. -Yes. ﻿You've always worked among men, you've been a leader of people, ﻿yet, by your own choice, ﻿you've sometimes desired and have gotten solitude, whether it be personal or political. ﻿Has solitude been important to you? Is this part of a philosophy of life? ﻿It is not correct that you say "solitude. ﻿For instance, when I decided to come here, ﻿to live here, it is not for solitude. ﻿But you don't mind being alone. ﻿No, when I have to do some work I was born to be alone. ﻿Or to read. I can't read with others. ﻿But no, not to be alone... or solitude... no. ﻿But I will tell you what is my view on these things. ﻿I believe that every human being can be good and can be bad. ﻿It depends a great deal where he finds himself, ﻿what people are serving as their example. ﻿This is why, for instance, I am against having big cities. ﻿The big ©itfes are not good for humanity. ﻿It's better to live in a small place where each knows the other man. ﻿They can be more friendly. ﻿We don't ne'ed-a city more than 10 or 15 thousand people. ﻿Why big cities? ﻿All Jews are going to Tel Aviv. ﻿They should... You can have 100 cities. Even more, 500... in the Negev. ﻿The most important thing which I learned, ﻿I learned by living here. Living this life. ﻿I want to live in a place when I know ﻿- that my friends, and myself, we did it. Everything. ﻿I﻿t's our creation. ﻿You see, the trees which I see, I know we have planted it. ﻿The trees then speak to me in another language. ﻿I know it can be created by man. ﻿Rain fell in Sde Bokerthis morning, reason enough for celebration ﻿in a settlement located in Israel's most arid region. ﻿The celebration of the rain coincides with another celebration, ﻿the dedication ceremony of the radio-telephone network. ﻿Mr. David Ben-Gurion commented on the general importance of the achievement. ﻿I want to thank you ﻿for bringing us the dubious blessing of the radio-telephone. ﻿I say "dubious" because one of my pleasures has been ﻿not knowing the curse of the telephone ﻿which always interrupts me when I'm reading a book, ﻿but I guess there's no avoiding it. ﻿Since now we've become Northerners; the distance from here to Eilat ﻿is greater than the distance, when I came to Eretz Israel, ﻿from the southernmost point in Eretz Israel to the most northern. ﻿The time has come to put the new device to the test. ﻿Hello. Oh, hello, Mr. President! ﻿I'm sending you greetings from the Negev settlements ﻿over the radio-telephone that we're dedicating now. ﻿In honor of this important event the rain started falling ﻿but our guests are happy and we send our regards. ﻿The greatest teaching, which in my view is the greatest teaching, ﻿is words - which are not connected with deeds ﻿"are absolutely nothing". ﻿In our kibbutz I told them my name is David. Not Ben-Gurion. ﻿So every morning I came to see what David has to do, ﻿and I went to do the work. ﻿This is what our prophets said, ﻿to serve as an example to other people. ﻿One of the greatest prophets in my view is Jeremiah. ﻿I have the feeling that what he was saying is true. ﻿And when he said: "God said to me"... ﻿he heard it in his heart, he didn't talk with God, ﻿nobody can talk with God. ﻿But this was his deep feeling. ﻿And he was a great statesman. ﻿He understood politics more than the kings. ﻿But he was unpopular. ﻿A statesman who is not considering the things which ought to be done, ﻿whether it is popular or not, ﻿then he is a dangerous man. If he looks to be only popular. ﻿But you've had many decisions to make which were unpopular. ﻿At the time you decided to accept German reparations, for example. ﻿That was very unpopular. ﻿Of course it was unpopular. ﻿First of all, I thought that the attitude to all Germans as to Nazis is wrong. ﻿It's unjust. That's all. ﻿I couldn't say that Adenauer is a Nazi, he was not a Nazi. ﻿Violent demonstrations throughout Israel today. ﻿Adenauer raus! ﻿Blood money! Guilt money! screamed the crowd ﻿as stones were thrown at the parliament building. ﻿At the center of the storm are the negotiations ﻿between Israel and Western Germany ﻿on reparations to compensate the survivors of Hitler's concentration camps. ﻿The survivors insist: Genocide has no price. ﻿Adenauer's Germany ﻿is not Hitler's Germany. ﻿The Germany of our time will never again be what it was before WWII. ﻿You Germans knew. ﻿Now what we call reparations ﻿you call wiedergutmachen. ﻿When I hear that German word.. ﻿do you know what it means in Hebrew? ﻿Rectifying the injustice! ﻿Not only did they kill six million men, women and children, ﻿they stole our money, tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars. ﻿It was a very emotional problem. ﻿People had lost relatives, they'd lost family. ﻿Yes, I know... ﻿Therefore with people, who were living in Auschwitz, ﻿I don't discuss this question. ﻿I know I can not explain them. ﻿I don't expect them to understand it ﻿so with them I don't discuss it. ﻿I discuss it with only with people who didn't suffer themselves. ﻿But by reason. It is not reasonable, ﻿it is unjust, it is not Jewish. ﻿Because both Jeremiah said, and the same thing said Ezekiel. ﻿"In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, ﻿"and the children's teeth are set on edge..." ﻿"every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge". ﻿Those who are criminals, they will suffer, but not their children. ﻿And not the fathers for their children, and this is right. ﻿Although in history it is not so. ﻿America is suffering now from the crimes of their forefathers. ﻿They brought slaves from Africa and they are paying now for it. ﻿Mr. Ben-Gurion.. ﻿But this is immoral. History is not moral. ﻿This morning at 9:30 ﻿David Ben-Gurion and Chancellor Adenauer met ﻿in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel where they are both staying. ﻿My meeting with Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, affected me a lot, ﻿For a long time I've been an admirer of his strength ﻿and his statesmanlike accomplishments. ﻿I wish the Chancellor every success in his efforts ﻿to guide Germany in its path of democracy ﻿and international cooperation. ﻿Thank you very much. ﻿Adenauer and the Israeli head of government, Ben-Gurion, ﻿signed a secret document concerning West German deliveries of arms to Israel. ﻿So far more than 5,000 Israeli soldiers ﻿and officers have been trained by the Bundeswehr (German army) ﻿on the basis of West German-Israeli secret treaties. ﻿Currently 52 West German scientists and over 400 arms experts ﻿are working in Israeli research institutes ﻿which deal with the military application of nuclear energy. ﻿The nuclear plant in the Negev Desert is available to them for practical experiments. ﻿Bonn has spent over 81 million marks for these purposes so far. ﻿Jews, don't forget and don't forgive the Nazis! ﻿Not only did they kill six million men, women and children, ﻿Do you think that before the Nazi era ﻿we could have saved more Jews? ﻿You can not save people who don't know what is their fate. ﻿Those who accuse the Jews that didn't defend themselves, I think it's wrong. ﻿They were powerless. ﻿Well, a million children were killed, what could the children do? ﻿More than a million mothers were killed, what could they do? ﻿They were undressed, called to stay here, ﻿and then they were killed. ﻿I read whatever was written about that, ﻿I doubt whether they could have prevented it. ﻿The others could have prevented it, ﻿allowing them to come to Israel. ﻿This yes. But they didn't allow them. ﻿Could Churchill have prevented it? ﻿I doubt it. You see, I can't accuse him. ﻿Churchill had one task, to defeat Hitler. ﻿Churchill was a good friend of Zionism. ﻿But he was right in thinking that the main task now is to defeat Hitler. ﻿But they could have saved many Jews. ﻿They were asked to bomb Auschwitz, ﻿Treblinka, they could do it. They didn't do it. ﻿What were yo,mr reactions when you saw the Jews in Europe ﻿after World War II? ﻿What were you doing in Germany at that time? ﻿When the war was over, I decided to go to see the Jews in Germany, ﻿the DP's (displaced persons). ﻿Were you moved when you saw these... ﻿Did you actually see the camps themselves? ﻿Oh, I was in all camps. We, the last remnant of European Jewry, ﻿we accuse Europe. ﻿We are stateless, homeless. ﻿It was the Jewish people who made Palestine, ﻿that was Palestine who made the Jewish people. ﻿There is an obligation ﻿to encourage the administration of Palestine ﻿asking for freedom of Jewish immigration ﻿which will result in a free and democratic Jewish commonwealth in Palestine. ﻿Many Jews think of Israel as a place of refuge for unfortunate Jews. ﻿Why should the Jews come back to Zion? ﻿Well, our mission.. We had a great Jew. ﻿It's about 3,300 years ago. ﻿He was the greatest Jew we ever had. ﻿His name was Moshe. ﻿He said: ﻿"You are the smallest of the nations". ﻿"and you must be an Am Segula". ﻿"Am Segula" could be translated as "a nation of higher virtues"? ﻿This is one of the meanings. ﻿What would be our virtues, then? ﻿The virtues we should aspire to? ﻿Well, the virtues which we were asked by our prophets, ﻿was to be just, truthful, ﻿helping all those who need help, ﻿and love other men like yourself. ﻿These are the virtues. ﻿Do you think Israel is carrying out that mission? ﻿Not yet. ﻿When you were head of the movement ﻿and were prime minister of this coumtry, ﻿did you also tell the people, or try to, ﻿tell the people to be an Am Segulla? ﻿As soon as the war (1948 War) was over, ﻿as long as the war was going on, ﻿I thought security is our main business. ﻿When the war was over, this was the beginning of January 1949, ﻿I called together our best men which we have here... ﻿Buber... Hugo Bergmann... and others. ﻿And I said to the;m: While until now, ﻿we had to fight, which is against our belief and our faith, ﻿but destiny imposed it on us. ﻿And unless we will keep and increase spiritual superiority, ﻿I doubt whether we will be able to achieve what we ought to achieve. ﻿And therefore we need you. ﻿This is a very big day. ﻿It's Mr. Ben-Gurion's Birthday. ﻿The whole family, his children and grandchildren, ﻿have come together with many lifelong friends. ﻿Amongst them is the president of the State of Israel, Mr. Yitzhak Ben-Zvi ﻿who has come to offer his congratulations to his long time colleague and associate. ﻿A president's suit must be cleaned, ﻿and Mrs. Ben-Gurion takes care of that. We grew up with and without a father. ﻿When I was a child, my father was the secretary of the Labor Federation ﻿and it didn't pay very much. ﻿When we sat down to eat and I said: "Come eat with us, Mother," ﻿she'd say: "No, I'll eat with Father when he gets home." ﻿When he came home and said: "Come join me, Paula," ﻿she'd say: "No, I ate with the children." ﻿She deprived herself because there wasn't enough food. ﻿Father never knew of this. ﻿He was in a different world. ﻿It was hard for our mother. ﻿Moving from the city to a wilderness with no company, ﻿young people... It didn't bother Father, ﻿all he needed was paper and a pencil and a book. ﻿Mr. Ben-Gurion, I like the idea of talking to you ﻿in this kibbutz where you've retired. ﻿We spoke about your resignation, in order to come down here, ﻿suppose was for you the end of politics. ﻿The end of politics... ﻿was very much against it. ﻿You were against the resignation... ﻿The resignation of the politics. ﻿You'd like him to go on in politics? ﻿Yes, because he could not exist without politics... ﻿I can exist without politics. ﻿No, you can't... It's born in you. ﻿Mrs. Ben-Gurion, did you share your husband's Zionist enthusiasms? ﻿Yes... We obviously have some difficulties. ﻿I also have my opinion. But I thought that is the right thing. ﻿It must have been a difficult time to bring up children with all this going on. ﻿How did you make out? ﻿I had no alternative, I had to make it out. ﻿It's a good thing they^came out something, when I took care of them. ﻿Well, this was really her task, because I was traveling... ﻿Of course, but you managed to do that? ﻿Of course, with nci piaster (monetary unit) in the house... ﻿Your life must have undergone a tremendous change when... ﻿you were describing ﻿how looking after the children with no piasters, ﻿and then you find yourself the wife of the prime minister... ﻿I knew he was a leader, what's the difference, ﻿I knew he is a leader... ﻿So, it really didn't make much difference? -No. ﻿And when they addressed me as the prime minister's wife ﻿I told them, I'm not the prime minister's wife, ﻿I'm the wife of Ben-Gurion. ﻿There is a country, Israel, their nation... ﻿Yes. ﻿How is that going to affect, ﻿the character of Jews as we've known them? ﻿I'm a Jew, not only an Israeli, I'm an Israeli Jew, but I'm a Jew. ﻿And what about the Zionist? ﻿Well, Zionists, I've declared ﻿that I'm not a Zionist more than 10 or 12 years ago. ﻿What does that mean when you say you are not a Zionist? ﻿See, when I became a Zionist I thought "I'll be a Zionist" ﻿means to return to Zion, that's it. Not to live in Plonsk... ﻿Then you think they should all come here? ﻿Yes. When there wasn't a state ﻿nobody is coming, so what is the meaning of Zionism? ﻿But they are entitled to call themselves Zionists, ﻿so I'm not a Zionist. ﻿I married a Zionist and he is not a Zionist!? ﻿Then I saw the name "socialism has no meaning... ﻿and I asked myself a second question, ﻿who calls himself a socialist? ﻿Hitler, on one side, National Socialist, and Stalin. ﻿If Stalin is a socialist, ﻿I have nothing to do with that kind of socialism... ﻿Mr. Ben-Gurion, you are not a Zionist, ﻿you are not a Socialist, what are you? ﻿I'm a Jew who wants to live in a world ﻿where there is peace among all nations ﻿and where there is no exploitation ﻿but mutual help among human beings. Paula Ben-Gurion, died from sudden internal bleeding. ﻿Ben-Gurion's friends arrived in Sde Boker to share the grief of the family. ﻿Many shared the grief of her death. ﻿Your life must have changed considerably since your wife passed away. ﻿Yet you go on working, you're not a crushed man. ﻿A crushed man? No. Why should I be crushed? ﻿Many people are crushed by loss. ﻿By? -By loss. ﻿By loss... Yes, well of course. ﻿I don't feel now what I felt even four months ago, ﻿but I can't help it. ﻿I didn't expect that, I was certain that I will die before her. ﻿But fate decided otherwise. ﻿This cannot be changed. ﻿I read many of the letters that you wrote to Paula ﻿in the early years of your marriage, ﻿they reveal a great love, a great tenderness. ﻿You see... she was a remarkable woman. ﻿She was not a Zionist, she had very little Jewish feeling, ﻿she was an American, she was an anarchist. ﻿At that time, all the progressive youth were anarchists. ﻿And her hero was an anarchist woman, Goldman. ﻿This was the greatest man she knew. ﻿She had no interest in Israel, ﻿she didn't know what for, ﻿America is better, why do we need the land of Israel? ﻿But when we decided to marry each other ﻿told her that you will have to go to Israel, ﻿and I told her what Israel is, then. ﻿And she agreed. ﻿And so she really later came in November 1919 ﻿she came to Israel with the child. ﻿Then, suddenly, 50 years ago, I told her: I'm going to the desert. ﻿She thought I am mad ﻿that I am resigning the government and going to live in the desert, ﻿but she did. she followed me. ﻿Not many women would do that. ﻿So she was very much devoted, and this is a great thing. ﻿And now I am alone but I can't help it. ﻿I'm now a half-man but I must do what I can. ﻿In the channel of Zin Creek at twilight ﻿the graduation ceremony took place for the first cohort of the high school ﻿near Sde Boker Academy. ﻿Among the large crowd sitting on the soft sand ﻿the energetic, active initiator stood out. ﻿His weathered face and white quiff ﻿blended into the scenery. ﻿The current sings in the pipes ﻿The pipes are the arteries of the Negev ﻿This is the way of the song ﻿From the valve to the soil ﻿Turn, turn, sprinkler, hey... ﻿When he was asked to speak ﻿he said: "I have nothing to say. Bless you." ﻿I tried to get the man to speak. ﻿I asked if he'd agree to discuss matters besides the Negev ﻿but he refused. ﻿He skipped over the rocks and sand, got into his car ﻿and returned to his green cabin in Sde Boker. ﻿I'd like to ask you a question about yourself. ﻿You can work almost under any circumstances... ﻿I once spoke to Feldenkrais ﻿and he was disparaging willpower. ﻿I said: Ben-Gurion has willpower, and he said: No. ﻿And his definition was this: ﻿Willpower is something you need to do what you don't want to do. ﻿Ben-Gurion doesn't work on willpower, ﻿he likes what he does. ﻿Would you agree with that? ﻿That's true that I like what I do. That's true. ﻿But, you still need willpower to do it... ﻿Perhaps he is fight... ﻿What type of exercise did you do with Feldenkrais? ﻿Oh, it is very complicated. ﻿He knows his work. ﻿Before the Sinai Campaign I again was with lumbago. ﻿He knows th'fe entire- anatomy of man ﻿like no doctor which I met in my life. ﻿And he healed me, and no more lumbago. ﻿When he started going out on walks ﻿people would phone him, wanting to talk to him. ﻿He said: I don't have the time, ﻿but if you want to come walk with me, ﻿we have an hour and we can talk. ﻿He couldn't fall asleep at night. ﻿And he'd read not just one entire book, ﻿he'd read several at the same time. ﻿Why did I make him stand on his head? The whole world was against it. ﻿But I said to Ben-Gurion: ﻿"Look, you have a small body, ﻿"you've never been proud of your body ﻿"which is why you neglected it and as a youth you got into intellectual matters ﻿"without every having had a youthful stage ﻿"like everyone else. You're lacking that now, ﻿"which is why I want you to do something ﻿"which you see as a circus trick. ﻿"What can't you do at all?" ﻿He said: "Stand on my head." ﻿So I said: "Stand on your head ﻿"and you'll see you do it better than many people younger than you." ﻿Once he managed to stand on his head ﻿he was the happiest man in the world. ﻿He competed with Yehudi Menuhin in Tiberias. ﻿Yehudi Menuhin stood on his head. ﻿Ben-Gurion said he could stand on his head longer... ﻿Mr. Ben-Gurion? ﻿Yes, please. -Yes. ﻿I'd like to ask you a question ﻿about your connection to Jewish history. ﻿Jewish history? -And, it's this: ﻿The prophets, in the Bible, ﻿had a vision for the future. ﻿and they connected that vision with the faith in .God, ﻿the presence of God is in the prophets. ﻿Yes. ﻿They needed strength and they turned to God. ﻿Do you also turn to God when you need strength? ﻿Are you sure that they turned to God? ﻿What do you mean by saying turning to God? ﻿Does God live in some place and you' turn to him? ﻿They could pray to God... -God is everywhere. ﻿What do you think-they turned to? ﻿They turned... turning to God is thinking deeply'about something. ﻿They turn to God..? ﻿They take his address and go there? ﻿Thinking deeply about something? -Yes. ﻿Meditating? -Meditating. Of course. ﻿This is turning to God. ﻿Well, the Rambam ^Maimonides) said: "God. doesn't talk". ﻿He's not a humaip tojeing. ﻿Do you think there is a lot of room in Judaism for meditation? ﻿Is meditation a theme in Judais^?’ Well, I'm afraid now you use the word meditation in the Buddhistic sense. ﻿In the Buddhistic sense? -You, I think. ﻿Meditation is not that meaning which you now apply to it. ﻿In Buddhism... There is a context for meditation in Buddhism? ﻿Yes. ﻿Did you find that in Buddhism, when you were interested in Buddhism? ﻿No. I saw there people were doing it... meditating. ﻿Do you find that meditation is helpful? ﻿No... Well, there is meditation and there is thinking. ﻿Thinking I think is helpful. ﻿Yes? -Yes. ﻿Are there other things in Buddhism' that interest you? ﻿Oh, there are manuy. He was a very great man. ﻿See, U Nu said, we had a talk, he was sitting in Hong Kong, ﻿﻿I was in Jerusalem ﻿and the American television man was in New York. ﻿Good evening, ﻿tonight's Small World unites two statesman and scholars ﻿who are also old friends. ﻿Shalom, Mr. Ben-Gurion. ﻿Shalom, Mr. U Nu. ﻿U Nu, in a recent speech you said that part of the world's troubles and ills ﻿came from the repeated use of the word "I." ﻿According to Buddhism ﻿this is the, the very source of all the troubles. ﻿So if we want to get rid of all these troubles, ﻿first of all, we must get rid of this "I." ﻿"I consciousness." ﻿What do you think we should do in order to get rid of this "I consciousness? " ﻿Meditate. Meditation is the only way by which we can get rid of that "I." ﻿That's why, when I visited Israel a few years ago, ﻿I had invited the prime minister to come over to Rangoon, ﻿and have a little bit of meditation. ﻿He had accepted it. ﻿But meditation, my dear U Nu, is not enough. ﻿Meditation is merely a personal thing. ﻿Every one of us must do something for the world, for humanity. ﻿The "I" is not so bad in itself, ﻿the question is whether it's a selfish I ﻿or a human I. ﻿Buddha also believed in the non-self, Anatta. ﻿His teaching was a teaching of love, human love. ﻿He said: Hatred doesn't cease through hatred, ﻿only by love. ﻿This is in Dhammapada, they said. ﻿And this was said 500 years before Christ. ﻿And this also what you find in the Torah. ﻿Very deep, old human morality. ﻿"You shall love your fellow man as yourself." ﻿"You shall love thy fellow man like yourself." ﻿So the German teachers of the Bible, they interpret it, it means only Jews. ﻿But they forgot that in the same chapter, Chapter 19 Leviticus, ﻿it said a little later: ﻿"If a stranger will live among you, ﻿"he should be to you like a citizen and you should love him like yourself ﻿"because you were strangers in Egypt." ﻿So it doesn't mean only Jews. ﻿Mr. Ben-Gurion, do you think Israel is going to have to fight the Arabs again? ﻿And if so, can we win? Not... What I would say, ﻿they maybe, they have to fight again. ﻿Even several times, but I wouldn't say that they must fight again. ﻿For instance, take the prophecy: ﻿"Nation will no longer fight against nation, nor learn war any more." ﻿They shouldn't learn war any more. ﻿They shouldn't spend their money and their time ﻿and their people, their young men, ﻿preparing for war. ﻿But if a country has to defend itself as in the War of Independence? ﻿I think this is the unique case in the history of the world, ﻿certainly in our time, ﻿that a new state, in the same day when it was proclaimed, ﻿when it became a state, it was attacked by all their neighbors. ﻿I don't know of any other case. ﻿Of course this compelled us to give our best youth, ﻿and our best brains, ﻿for security. ﻿Ten years ago today ﻿Mr. Ben-Gurion read the Israeli Declaration of Independence ﻿at the historic assembly. ﻿Now PM Mr. David Ben-Gurion will speak. ﻿The event that took place in this hall ten years ago ﻿is engraved on the pages of both Jewish and world history. ﻿I, your humble servant, was one of the few ﻿who didn't take part in the celebration. ﻿My heart was full of grave anxiety. ﻿And I would not express this personal experience ﻿if I didn't think it would have important consequences. ﻿Now the first lady of Israel theater, ﻿Hanna Robina, approaches the microphony. ﻿She will read the declaration of independence ﻿which was read by Mr. Ben Gurion ten years ago. ﻿"The Land of Israel was the birthplace of the Jewish people. ﻿"Here their spiritual, religious and political identity was shaped. ﻿"Accordingly, we, ﻿"the members of the People's Council ﻿"are here assembled on the day of the termination of the British mandate ﻿"over the Land of Israel. " ﻿But you knew that when you declared a state ﻿the community here was in danger. ﻿There were people, United States for example, ﻿which counseled a delay of the declaration of independence, yet you went ahead with it. ﻿Were you confident at the time that Israel could make a stand? ﻿Or did you have doubts? ﻿I knew that we can win. ﻿I couldn't say to myself "I'm certain that we will" ﻿because it didn't depend only on me. ﻿It depended, will we be able to bring over the arms. ﻿In other words, if you had the arms you could depend on the people. ﻿Yes on the people, yes. I knew the people, we can depend on them. ﻿They had the right qualities? ﻿Yes. This I knew all the time. ﻿What were these qualities? ﻿These qualities were love for peace ﻿but capability of fighting when necessary. ﻿The first organization that has shown that was HaShomer ('The Guard'). ﻿This was under the Turks, before the Mandate. ﻿But the new thing which we'd done was to guard ourselves. ﻿Meaning self-defense. ﻿To defend the Jewish villages when necessary, ﻿but to make an effort to have good relations with the Arabs. ﻿And this was the spirit of the Jewish army, ﻿to have a force which will be able to defend, ﻿but also can assure peace and good relations. ﻿In that respect we didn't succeed. ﻿HaShomer succeeded more in that than we. ﻿11 know the type of people/ that laid the foundations ﻿for the State of Israel since 1870. ﻿I made a study and I knew them personally ﻿since I came to this country nearly 62 years ago. ﻿They were not that type. They didn't come for war ﻿and for conquest. ﻿They had that vision and that pioneering spirit and that devotion. ﻿But when there was a danger to their existence, they must defend themselves. ﻿Do you think there's any danger that if the military ﻿continues to have such a prominent role to play in the affairs of state... ﻿Not our army, no. Not our army. ﻿The army here was not merely a military unit. ﻿It is the great educational institution we have in the country; ﻿They brought together different ethnic groups, ﻿European communities, Asian communities, African communities. ﻿And when I saw that there are many who cannot read and write, in the army. ﻿When he came to this country he was already 15 ﻿so you cannot compel him to go to school. ﻿But he must go to the army. ﻿So he came to the army and he cannot read and write. ﻿I gave an order that for 6 months ﻿they should be free from military service and only learn. ﻿And he got it. So he feels he is rising, he feels great. ﻿So this is the best school for uniting the people and giving them trust in their leaders. ﻿In Eilat, Israel's southernmost port and its gateway to the Red Sea, ﻿he reviews a parade of young soldiers. ﻿How do you feel about your work as minister of defense ﻿as you look back on it today? ﻿I think it was not bad. ﻿And when a person has to make big decisions involving countries, lives, ﻿there must always be the fear of making mistakes. ﻿How do you get over the fear? ﻿You can never know if you are not making a mistake. ﻿Because if you know you are making a mistake, you don't make it. ﻿You do something because you think it's right. ﻿And I never assumed that, no, I can't make a mistake. ﻿But from what I could understand, I thought it ought to be done. ﻿But there were several things, which the government didn't accept, ﻿and the majority is ruling. ﻿But most occasions they accepted it. ﻿You know that most of the countries that have been established since WWII ﻿have failed at democracy. ﻿Can Israel's democracy survive? ﻿I hope it will. ﻿And sometimes democracy can make mistakes, ﻿but it's better to make a mistake in democracy, than make right wing. ﻿When you are here, do you miss... ﻿some of the people that you've been associated with for many years ﻿who are now politically alienated from you? ﻿Well, who? ﻿Dayan, Golda Meir... -For? ﻿Do you miss them? People that you were accustomed to see... ﻿I don't miss them, I am sorry that they are doing not the right thing. ﻿They are very nice men, like them. ﻿And I am sorry they are doing certain things which they shouldn't have done. ﻿But all right, perhaps everybody... ﻿I'm afraid I also did certain things which I shouldn't have done. ﻿I know one speech which I have made in the Parliament, ﻿now I wouldn't make it. ﻿You wouldn't make it? -No. ﻿Immediately after the war... the Sinai Campaign was over. ﻿I was so.. ﻿﻿In seven days they took the whole Sinai. ﻿I thought it's impossible. ﻿The area of Sinai is at least 5 times as big as the whole of Israel. ﻿So I got a little drunk with that victory ﻿and I said a little too much ﻿which I wouldn't say now. ﻿went too far. ﻿Some of the government thought ﻿that I want to have Sinai as a part of Israel. ﻿And I was asked this question: ﻿Will you annex Sinai if you catch it? ﻿I said: "No. Our intention is to go to Sinai, ﻿"is to ensure freedom of navigation in Eilat". ﻿Let us not forget what happened this last year, ﻿the Six-Day War. ﻿Good evening. This, the third day of the Middle East war, ﻿has shown convincing proof of Israel's military superiority. ﻿" Israeli armored columns continue their sweep to the (southwest ﻿beyond the Gaza Strip and to the south in Sinai. ﻿How did it happen? And, more important, what happens now? ﻿Mr. Ben-Gurion, is this 1956 all over again? No, this is 1967 And is it better than 56'? ﻿Well, people must make progress. You think you are making real progress today? ﻿﻿I hope so. ﻿Where would you like to stop? ﻿Are you going to occupy the whole of Jerusalem? ﻿No, we are satisfied with our present boundaries. ﻿Do you wish to increase the land area of Israel? ﻿If they will try against our part of Jerusalem, we will show them. ﻿Do you wish to increase the land size of Israel? ﻿No. We want to have peace on the basis of status quo. ﻿We've captured the Temple Mount, over. ﻿Roger. Well done. ﻿This is the Western Wall, and I'm touching the stones of the Western Wall. ﻿I was in London when the war broke out in '67, ﻿and near to after the war, while I was in the hotel, ﻿a telephone rings saying, Tel Aviv calling, and there was Mr. Ben-Gurion. ﻿And he urged me to some at once, ﻿and I said 1 want to come, ﻿this is my ceuntry and I want to come, but... ﻿I will choose the time for coming. ﻿I jusst can't come now. ﻿He did. ﻿And I saw him in England. ﻿I came out with suggestions as far as Palestine was concerned, ﻿I said: We think that the Arab case of Palestine ﻿sheul'S be presentee! by the Palestinians 'themselves. ﻿But we don't have the means; we don't have the possibility. ﻿Does that mean that I am a beggar, or anything... no. ﻿Of course, I have known Mr. Ben-Gurion for more than forty years. ﻿I used to see him almost daily. ﻿And to like, very much, Mr. Ben-Gurion, because of his frankness. ﻿His frankness was sometimes frightening ﻿when he would express his views ﻿about the destiny and the future of the Arabs. ﻿We disagreed, ﻿but we always wanted to try and find a common ground. ﻿But I'm afraid that he's out of politics, ﻿and you are now in the flush of your war victory ﻿and we are under-the spirit of being defeated ﻿and being downtrodden and all the rest of it. ﻿And so both of us are in abnormal conditions. ﻿I consider you just as much abnormal as we are. ﻿Because you are not considering the future, ﻿you are only considering the present. ﻿And we are not'considering the distant future, ﻿we are considering our present suffering. ﻿gut I do believe that this’country ﻿has the making of a country of pease. ﻿Mr. Ben-Gurion, ﻿since you've been in this country, practically, it's been in a state of war. ﻿Almost half a century... ﻿I'm more than half a century here. ﻿I was reborn here. -You were reborn... ﻿I consider my birth when I came to this country. ﻿In 1956, in the Sinai Campaign, Israel withdrew under some world pressure. ﻿Do you think there is any hope for a permanent peace here? ﻿Or is this a kind of state that's going to go on for another century? ﻿﻿I can give you my personal view, ﻿you know I don't belong to any party. ﻿I don't speak on behalf of anybody here. ﻿﻿If I would have a choice ﻿between peace and all the territories which we conquered last year, ﻿I would prefer peace. ﻿Because I know that within the boundaries ﻿which we have got before the Six-Day War, ﻿we could settle as many Jews as are likely to come ﻿within the next twenty or forty years. ﻿The West Bank of the Jordan, occupied by Israel during the Six-Day War, ﻿and the scene of some of the most bitter guerrilla fighting ever since. ﻿And now the center of a new political storm ﻿with the American proposal that any peace settlement with Jordan ﻿must in,elude the handing back of this territory. ﻿Mr. Rogers first meeting in Israel was with Mr. David Ben-Gurion. ﻿Mr. Ben-Gurion, did you present to Mr. Rogers ﻿your well-known views about the future of the Israeli-occupied territories? ﻿Yes, but I told him it's only my opinion. ﻿Retreat - danger! Retreat - danger! ﻿Mr. Ben-Gurion, Israel is once again faced with an historical challenge, ﻿that is the negotiation of a peace treaty ﻿recognizing secure boundaries. ﻿Do you think that the government's policy ﻿is one that can achieve peace in the Middle East? ﻿You mean the Israeli government? -Yes. ﻿They made only one mistake in my view, ﻿when Rogers made his plan... -The Secretary of State. ﻿They didn't accepted it entirely. ﻿They did not accept it. -No, only under conditions. ﻿Egypt accepted it. ﻿I myself think it's a mistake. ﻿I knew that we are entitled to the whole of Israel. ﻿This was our country, it was never a Palestinian people, ﻿there was never a Palestinian state, ﻿and we never gave up our hope to come back to our country, ﻿and it's our country. ﻿But, if I have to choose the entire country or peace, ﻿I think peace is more important. ﻿My own view is that if you can have peace ﻿we should give up all the territories which we conquered, ﻿with two exceptions: Jerusalem and Golan Heights. ﻿Withdrawal, then? ﻿Everything. ﻿So withdrawal today is one of the most sensitive ﻿and politically controversial words. ﻿Do you think that Mrs. Meir (Prime Minister) ﻿has to hold an election ﻿to ask the people for a mandate on withdrawal? ﻿I don't know, ﻿I only once talked with her, ﻿we met for some reasons. ﻿What is your question? Whether she will... ﻿Whether she should. If you were prime minister ﻿would you hold an election on the issue of withdrawal ﻿and put the question before the people? ﻿If I would be prime minister I would say this is my view, ﻿if you don't accept it, ﻿you are entitled not to accept it, but then I must leave. ﻿I will resign. ﻿Happy birthday to you... ﻿This meeting ﻿is dedicated to the 85th birthday of a unique, special man, ﻿none other than David Ben-Gurion. ﻿Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, ﻿honored Knesset members, ﻿current and future, ﻿since I mainly concern myself, since I retired from government, ﻿with the future, ﻿I won't argue about things I have a lot to argue about, ﻿instead I'll speak about the future. ﻿Our historic yearning has been for a new society ﻿built on liberty, equality, tolerance, ﻿mutual aid and love of man, ﻿a society without exploitation, discrimination, slavery or tyranny. We cannot boast that the nation in Israel is already an exemplary nation. ﻿Our status in the world ﻿will not be determined our supposed material wealth, ﻿nor by our military might, ﻿but by the moral light of our undertakings. ﻿And although there are some shadows, ﻿among them heavy shadows in ouir lives now, ﻿"We have grounds to believe ﻿that we can be.an exemplary nation! ﻿Let us celebrate ﻿Let us celebrate and rejoice ﻿Let US celebrete ﻿"Let us celebrate and rejoice ﻿"Let us sing, let us sing ﻿"Let us sing..." ﻿Now, what kind of music do you listen to? ﻿Do you listen to Classical music most of the time? ﻿Sometimes, not very often. -Not very much. ﻿Heaven help the child who never had a home ﻿Heaven help the man who gave that child a gun ﻿Heaven help the people with their backs against the wall ﻿Heaven help us all ﻿Heaven help us, Lord, ﻿Hear our call ﻿When we call... ﻿When you think of your own contribution ﻿to the fulfillment of the reestablishment of the state, ﻿what are the main areas of your contribution? ﻿If I would be alone, I would be able to do nothing. ﻿Pardon me? -I alone wouldn't be able to do anything. ﻿It's such a matter ﻿which doesn't depend on a single person. ﻿This is the mistake in general... There are many historians, which say: ﻿Oh, this was done by that leader and by that leader... ﻿﻿I don't believe it. ﻿There are things which been done by a single man, ﻿for instance, the theory of relativity. ﻿This was created by Einstein. ﻿Although when I spoke with Einstein, I read in his biography ﻿that Einstein was the only scientist which from pure thinking ﻿came to certain new ideas about science. ﻿I asked him: Is it true? ﻿He said: It's partly true. ﻿I myself didn't make all those experiments. ﻿But I knew the experiments which others made, ﻿and I drew from them certain conclusions. ﻿But without those experiments I wouldn't be able to reach my theory. ﻿But in history, I don't believe that a single person can change things. ﻿Unless it is done by the people or by a part of the people, ﻿it can't be done. ﻿And if we wouldn't have ﻿the pioneers of the first generation, ﻿we wouldn't be able to do that. ﻿But you can't deny that-you had a role? ﻿Of course, I was appointed prime minister, ﻿And you've guided Israel well? ﻿I didn't guide Israel, ﻿I guided myself. ﻿I never guided Israel. ﻿Do you fear for your country? ﻿Oh, I always feared. I always. Not only now. ﻿That the state does not yet exist. ﻿It's a beginning only. ﻿Thank you very much, Mr. Ben-Gurion. ﻿So we're finished? ﻿No, not yet, another ten minutes. ﻿We came at twenty to eight and now it's thirty to ten, ﻿so it's not yet two hours. ﻿ e can wrap this up. -Can we wrap this up? ﻿All right, all right, I am ready.
