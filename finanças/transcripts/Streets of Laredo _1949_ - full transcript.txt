* STREETS OF LAREDO * This is a tribute to men of courage and perseverance... men who were steadfast in danger and hardship... and whose history is the pride and heritage of the Lone Star... They had no uniforms... they lived hard... they fought hard... they died hard... carving out a record of glory in which every American shares... To the Texas Rangers! Let's go friend. Thank you for that, my lady. Damn thieving crawling vipers. I swear I will remember what you are like, from head to toe! Don't worry, the Rangers will catch you before the end of the day. Lorn, if you keep shooting like that my head will fly. Have you seen me fail, Wahoo? No, but when you do... Jim and I are looking for another partner. What? Do you feel bad? What? Well, this is going to pay us a good party. Whatever one says, so be it. And without making yourself beg. What will happen tonight? Do not ask, this puts you to lose. I just imagined it. Whatever it is, it will be great. Maybe we should share that too. Which is? I wouldn't understand, Wahoo. It is a women's article. It comes straight from Paris. That means problems. Scarce half of fabric. Give me your share. It is clear... Not so fast. It's for your safety. I take full responsibility. I will pay you everything. And if I'm done, I won't ask you anymore. You wouldn't have to give it to me. You got it? Ah, yes, yes, now I understand. But of course. And now let's go quickly. What? Hurry, Wahoo. This is a land of Rangers. Rangers? And what are we waiting for? If we could do some odd jobs and go to New York... would open a canteen, with the largest class that has ever been seen. Do you think that if I grow a mustache someone would recognize me? New York, Patricia. New Orleans, Felice. Here, Consuelo, or maybe Rosie. Everywhere the same. Except in Fork City, Utah. No matter where, there is nothing sweeter than lavender. Yeah, until it gets closer. Whoever it was was not good for you, friend. For me, there is only one good thing. Which is? Friendship, friend. Friend. Friend? Friend. It's in the valley, let's go. If that cattle must belong to someone, it better be ours. Go ahead. Come Wahoo. Take the cattle, please I take care of these fools You represent the law, I hope. It arrived in time. In this mess someone can get hurt. Do you mean it? Is he worried about you, is he your friend? He and his henchmen, I know him. Everyone knows me. Charley Calico. I only know what the evaluators in the office tell me. Evaluators? Nice name for some thieves. You must pay to protect your cattle... and if you don’t do it they’ll pull you away and burn the barn. These are the things that make me hate my job. Liar. Who, me? I own property, the biggest saloon in El Loso, I don't lie. Do you know? I do not believe that a man of his position... want to pay for those cows. I do this willingly. Remove the top weight. Point it out. You do not represent the law. You did the right thing. It left us with a good impression. Sure, sure. Perhaps we will meet again. Shooting as you do, why didn't you kill him? Wow, you are a wild lynx. I get along better with people who don't forget I'm a lady. I only see a lady who is the antithesis of beauty and charm. She speaks as well as she shoots. Well... there goes Uncle Gil's last cow. I always told you that one day, they would come for them and I would be drunk. And the cattle? There were few heads of cattle. Did you let them go? They had a lot of advantage. It is very beautiful, if you are a girl. Should I take them by the hand, to prevent their feet from embarking? We come back, to see how you do. I took care of one, the other paid and left. This was no time, to be sentimental. Did you make Calico pay the cattle with the idea of ​​giving me the money? How honored you are. Do you have the money? Oh, wow!... I forgot. How many heads? I didn't count. Okay, pay it and let's get out of here. The least Uncle Gil can do is invite you to have a drink. Wait a minute, is your uncle in there? Better not to go, in it doesn't look right. He was not very skilled, except with the bottle. But it was very good for me. I hope there is a lot of wine wherever it goes. I am the resurrection and the life, says the Lord. Thus the fate go and... Amen. What about the rest of your family? Everyone is there. What do we do? We must do something for her. What? Do you want to babysit a wild lynx? Who the hell do you believe you are? Has anyone asked you, to take me? Do you think I want to be seen as a presumptuous... who believes that going with someone who is not a hindrance? You do this very well, it is the first time that it touches you to receive this gentleman. And now, get out. Before I forget that I'm a lady... and kick your ass, quick. And you too. Come on, get out. Yes ma'am. Stop thinking about that Lynx and go to sleep. Yes, don't worry, women know how to take care of themselves. Are you looking for someone? A place to camp. They have already chosen the only one here. Okay, listen to me... My name is Rannie I don't like being followed. Nobody is following you. Are you the owner? We marched quickly and I don't think joining us... it will be pleasant for you. To get together? Do you think I'm stupid to join a gang... that eats crap... and who only knows how, to tie the horses about 30 meters from the nearest pasture? I think the lady is right. We would eat well and they would be better too. I'm not asking for favors, I can take care of myself. Take it or leave it. I think it is better to go back, to the ranch. It was burned. This is a lie. Go see for yourself. Okay, Lynx, make a bed. Am I allowed? Have you gone crazy? Where's your chivalry, friend? Welcome to the club. Play these five. Why do you do that? By none. Deep down it's as smooth as you or me. You are hungry? I ate on the road, thanks. Are you sure your house was set on fire? I hope so, I used all kerosene to start the fire. Forget. You'll get over it, it's just a girl. Yeah, but children have a habit of growing up. Especially girls. Yeah, and the older the more tricks they know. Maybe it's a girl, but she already knows some tricks. I think I overslept. Where are we going? Ah!... You know, the inspectors of cattle go anywhere. I wondered what they were. It couldn't be ordinary cowboys. Okay, Lynx, but remember, we don't carry alarm clocks. I will remember. Well, we're finally home, huh. Pop Lint has been a father to me. Really? I haven't seen him for centuries. Iuh-hu!. Come on. I want to surprise you. Hello, old vulture. Who are you? Well, I think I'm the person you're looking for, Pop Lint. Hey, you come from the appraisers office, right? Listen, Pop... No, you listen to me, son. This is mine. The house, all that land... but you haven't seen trees that give money, right? I can't make cattle grow faster, right? You tell Calico that I can not afford. This Calico seems, to be everywhere. Don't you work for him? Yesterday I saw him for the first time. How much money do you want to get? Other 500! 500? It's like skinning a live calf. Hey, Pop, I offer you a deal. I bring a customer. What is the problem? You are an old friend of mine... You who raised me. From childhood? And that client will stay here for as long as it lasts. And it's $ 500, for a guest, Pop. 500! Hey, I suppose this guest will be human. The guest is a girl, Pop. A girl? But seeing it you wouldn't say. Done? It's a lot of money. Good. Old friends know how to keep a secret. Come on, Pop wants us to stay a couple of days. It looks like a home to me. Come in, you'll get used to it. Pop, these are Wahoo, Jim and Lynx. My name is Rannie. I never thought I would get, to know them. But any friend of yours is my friend. Let's wash up and go to the city. We have something to celebrate. Can I use my old room, Pop? There is the kitchen, son. She keeps forgetting. It was Poly's. My wife. Now it's hers. Thanks. Sometimes I have an aspect that I can't believe. I don't care what you propose, but I would like to know. You have never seen this Pop in your life. Nor had I seen a talking Lynx. Maybe Pop has some money for us. Let's go. How far is El Loso, Pop? An hour. It will not arrive before dark. What is that? I hope to be as well dressed as you are. You are very good. Well, I don't know, I think it's a little bit fair. Uncle Gil bought it in Kansas. I think it got small. You are absolutely incongruous. Really? That is good? What you think? We'll tell you everything when we get back. Or almost everything. Sometimes I feel that way too. You have to deceive her for her own good. If we hadn't said we would be back... we would still have it behind us. She trusted her word. Perhaps that is your mistake, my friend. Give women what you promise. And where does that take you? It took me 90 days, but it was worth it. I don't want to scare you, but I think we have company. He's the smiling guy who took your cattle. We will have to speak again. Goodnight. I think they are going to check my good name in El Loso. You will like El Loso. El Loso appreciates me. Does the Sheriff appreciate you? Oh yeah. Will you have friends in the appraiser office? Yes, a good friend. Me. Well, let's go to El Loso. Not everyone can be proud of escort. Let's split up, quick. They lost us. We missed something else. He took our money. Money doesn't worry me. You'll be fine. "SOLITARY THIEF STEALS BANCO DOS BOIADEIROS" The Sheriff says his description looks like Lorn Reming. April 6, 1878 "250 DOLLARS OF REWARD" by Lorn Reming. Last Achievement Lorn Reming: Bandolero steals... $ 16.000 from, a Wells Fargo office. Eighth theft in two years $ 1.500 reward. Wanted for robbery the station of the Diligences of EL PASO. These rangers are making it difficult to earn a dollar worthily. Yes, just two years and we even engaged the horses. Why do you expect to find Lorn here? Look at this. This work was done on the eastern border. This he did along the western border. It never fails. If they look for you in the north, we'll wait here. All right... As he is gone, he may not like us to find him. I know Lorn well. I am sure that he is also looking for us. Here it comes. Before dinner we can buy a pair of horses. Remember, don't move until you see how everything is going. Then, by giving you the signal... if we do it well, the driver won't even notice. Go up? Yes, until the next town, let's get a pair of horses. Yes, we had to kill ours. They stuck their paws in a squirrel's nest. The two horses? Yes, both. All right, go up. In between. Ready Joe. Come on, up. Do you expect any problems? When you take so much money, anything can happen. Rangers? Yeah. Francisco is the best sniper in the company. Not that she expects an assault, she is guessing. You have to be crazy to steal a stagecoach. More than crazy, he would be suicidal. Yeah, I have a feeling that on this trip nothing will happen. Well, if nothing happens, Francisco will be very disappointed. You can stretch your legs while we give the horses water. Hurry up, Joe. Don't get too far either. Yeah of course. You were right, the driver won't even know. What do we do now? Nothing yet. They will leave you like a sieve. Robbery! Hey it's me. Give it to him. Did you catch him? This is very well. Well? He is still alive. Stick it on the stage. He will not come with us. Of course he will, I will charge a reward. I don't know if we will get to enjoy it. So, as a member of the Texas State Guard Corps... I solemnly swear, to keep the peace... impose law and order, doing everything in my power... so that Texas can be a safe place to live. With God's help. With God's help. Well? With God's help. Sign here. Your $ 200 reward dollars, you earned it. You started well. Here we don't ask anyone about their past. We suppose they ride and shoot better than most... or they would not have enlisted. And that is all I need. These men died in the line of duty. Not for earning $ 40 a month, but for an ideal. So, Jim Dawkins and Ruben Jones... you have joined a corporation that has a great heritage. And if you have good qualities, it will shine. If not, it will shine too. I think it's fair. Yes, very fair. Now I would shake hands and wish them luck. Well, I wish you luck. But, we have a habit... it may seem silly... But we prefer to wait, to meet the hand we shake. They will be assigned, a platoon and a duty. That is all. Hello Hello. Okay, I'm difficult to reason, obtuse... but can you tell me what we are doing? We had to swear to comply, with law and order. You are crazy? Did you see the date of those photos? Dates? Some of those guys weren't twenty. There were a couple of more than fifty years. They signed up late. But that's not the question, why are we here? Look at this. My God, it's Pete. Who made this? He is dead? Carefully, boys. This is a very difficult place. Let's quit and quickly. Just a moment. To get Lorn out of here, we need to come and go as we please. So we must be in the corporation. Yeah, that is right. We released him and put his hand on 200 turkeys. But I would like to do it now. I don't think he's very comfortable in that cage. I was walking... through the streets of Laredo. I didn't know what city I was in... it could have been anywhere. She also walked... through the streets of Laredo. These old adobe walls... became gold... when I saw her there. She smiled at me when she passed... and her eyes found mine. All together now ay, ay, ay... it looks like the view has a new glow. Now I'm not going for a walk... Through the streets of Laredo. Friend, all set. You want to know why we caught you... but there was no time... Now let's not go for a walk... through the streets of Laredo. Where's Jim? I was walking... Look, it's Lorn! He's running away! Come on, get it! What's on your mind? What were you thinking about? Even a novice would know how to enter a cell... to feed a prisoner. By all the saints, what trick did he use with you? Everything I know, Major, is that he took care of the horses when a cyclone came over me. It is the first prisoner that escapes I am responsible. Thank you both. A ranger's first responsibility... It is knowing what the word responsibility means. And until you learn... Here comes more. I just received the news that Malenty Land and Cattle... it takes a flock to the south, but I don't know if they will try to cross the river. It will take all the men in this platoon. You two included. I hope this is the last time that the company Malenty... sell your cattle in Mexico without having insurance for your loss. All ready to go in half an hour. Through the Quemado area. You are crazy. They will try Del Rio. The one by Ford Pinto. The major reserved Clay Bluff's crossing for them. See if you follow through. They don't trust us, Jim. And he is absolutely right. We left the rangers' detachment so quickly... who don't even know where we are. Come on. Just a moment. We can't leave without knowing anything about Lorn. He hit us and left us stretched. What do you need to do to convince yourself that he doesn't care about us? I think he had his reasons. He could tear your belly and still say you're right. Sometimes it is necessary to count on someone, whatever happens. Hey, in the valley. Aren't you going to mess with them? Let's go. Wait a moment! I thought that if the Major, wanted to patrol this area, he would send the Rangers who he least trusted. I figured out which rangers I wanted to see. Come on, dismount. Of course, friend. Yeah, you won't believe that, but when we decided to lock you up in jail... it was with the best intentions. Are you going to get off the horse? Sure, sure. Anything for a friend. We have a couple of things, to do. First. Wahoo, piece of rascal! Lorn! Jim! How is it going? Where have you been these two years? Looking for you. Did you take our heads off that night? I had my reasons. I needed two rangers with good reputation for passing a coup You do not understand? Sorry, this time I don't understand. I have no idea. Rangers know when there's a load of gold... or livestock movement. You just have to follow the Rangers... and give me the information. Yes, but you forget something important. You don't play with these rangers. I understand you, but you won't do well. Because? You said that two guards with a good reputation... but there is no one with a worse reputation than us. When you return these cattle to the city... what will the major think? That you must be the best Texas Rangers. Not so fast. There are four types below that don't think the same. Come and see them. They are from the company Malenty. They will not cause you problems. They are packed and ready to deliver. My bad luck was running into the Rangers. You are Rangers, right? Do your job. Rangers! Is that you? We will be in touch! Well done, guys. Yeah, it was a good game, rangers. Good job, guys. I feel like Napoleon. Wait? Didn't Lorn do that? Congratulations. You're in luck, guys. Yes, you are the happiest again. You go back to being like before. You will be hard to beat. Dawkins, Jones, I want to see you. It is the first occasion that we have to be alone. Congratulations on Malenty's cattle. It was nothing serious, just courage and brains. Thank you, Major, I know how much that means. I think the Malenty issue has been resolved... they must know how, to deal with other issues. Problems? The worst kind. Miss Carter, I offer two examples... of Texas Rangers. It's her? Is. Jim, Wahoo! Rannie! Oh, let me see you. Didn't I tell you that girls grow up? Yeah, yeah, you are fine. You are Rangers. Yeah. Where? What are you doing here? Wasting my time, which is what I do. I want Major to send us the law and order... that you are supposed to defend Before it's too late. I see that you know her well, you may be able to explain. The law prohibits guards from getting involved... if city officials don't officially ask. Calico would skin the Sheriff alive only if he looks at a ranger. Well, it could get most citizens to sign a petition. Pop asked your opinion on a petition... and you should see what they did. Texas should be a safe place to live. Is this how they do it? I'm sorry, Major, she's very outspoken. Come on, we have a lot to talk about. Jim, wait a minute. Show the barracks and see if you can convince her... to obtain a petition. Anything that makes your demand official. Yes sir. Pop and I did really well. We have sold 4,300 heads since you left. But we have nothing left. Calico still exploits us. Cattle and clothes, do you like it? What is wrong? You might like a cow... But a man wants to see clothes that highlight what you have. Do you know, that I see you... Inconsistent? I like these clothes. You know, running a ranch is, a difficult life for a woman. Digging ditches by day and feeding calves at night. Take care of cattle that may not be able to sell well in the summer. Women don't like that. Maybe some don't. Whoever it was... thinking like that he shouldn't even try. I did not say that. I just think a pretty girl... it must be in a place where they know how to appreciate it. And if you stay at home, marry a guy who knows how to value you. There is no law that forbids her to do what she wants. Yeah, you are right. I was stupid to think that all are the same. All but you. We've been thinking a lot about you. I thought about you too. In the three. You know, when you should go. I know. If nobody is going to say it, I will. Where is he? What he is doing? Yeah, you mean Lorn. Well, you see. He... Isn't he?... Oh, no, nothing happened to Lorn. I should have thought of that before. Come on. Where? Stay here, Wahoo. Friend Lorn, you won't like this. Not just Pop and me, Lorn. Calico has the whole community at hand. We work hard and he benefits the most. You're not happy to see me, right? Of course, Rannie. What do you want, to do with she? Explain what you try, to bring her here. I said that I prefer to be alone, to see a herd before buying. Every time we see each other there is a problem. Why do you pay Calico to protect you? Protect them from what? Himself. You have no proof of that. You just look for someone, to take a chance on you. It was easier for you to say no. Who said no? Calico has broken the law, right? I am your man. I will go to Mr. Calico. Thank you, Lorn. Pop and I appreciate that. She grew up. Yeah. I'll see. It has done something good. Good? It is the occasion that we hope for. Someone has to take Mr. Calico's place. And it has it in front of you. Believe me, Pop, we will never have to pay you again. I know what I'm saying. Rannie. It's time to tell Calico that we don't want him to protect us. This change of opinion comes from his visit to the Rangers. The rangers have nothing to do with it. How did you know where I went? Pop said he suffered one of her attacks. But Cantrell visited him, because he cannot walk. I did not say that. I'm leaving. I didn't come to bother you. Don't wait for it, to pass by her office. A woman and an old man. You like to play with an advantage, right? The thing is balanced. Miss, don't try it. Good afternoon. You don't want to bet, right? What do you ask? To pay them $ 400, more dollars on Saturday. Oh! Now I remember you. We will expect you on Saturday. You know business. So it is. It's your bride, right, huh? Get out. I hope to see you on Saturday. Where are we going? Do not worry. I have a surprise for you. Lorn, always comes, when I have problems. Well, who knows, this may be the last time you have them. It's not so bad, just a little hurt in your dignity, is it, Sheriff? Watch him until I get back. This afternoon, he sent an official request to the rangers... And I don't want, to change my mind. Good afternoon, Mr. Jessup. Hello. A bottle. This is what counts, right? Not for you, Mr. Jessup. It is not for me, my wife has, an attack of rheumatic fever. It was prescribed by the doctor. It will be $ 500, Mr. Jessup. Is something wrong, Mr. Jessup? I just refuse to pay more fees to your boss. Oh, no one regrets more than Mr. Calico who burned the office. Especially after begging, to let him protect you. That's right, Phil. You have a beautiful family, Mr. Jessup. It is a house. I would do well to protect them as I should. Tell Calico that if you try, to do something... He will come out with his feet together in front. You understand this? I am looking for a man named Calico. Because? To arrest you for murder. Read this. Officially requested on this date... by Sheriff R.E. Olsen. Bob Olsen, that hollow head traitor. I go... Not so fast. Calm down, Cantrell. The murder? A couple of years ago. A girl and her uncle had a small ranch. Her uncle was killed. Where does Calico live? Well... I'll tell you, Ranger. Do you know the Pop Lint Ranch? Continue left. Follow the gorge until you reach the needle cayion. Calico is on the other side of the canyon. Thanks! A bottle. Here you are, Mr. Jessup. Thanks. Thank you Ranger. No, no, Mr. Jessup, didn't you hear the boy say about the house? Isn't that what he said? On the house. I prefer to pay for it. Tell Calico that it will be much better if you surrender. I don't think to tell you anything. Did you see that? I'm glad to see you, Ranger. Follow him, Pipes. We'll camp out of town. We will see Pop at the ranch in the morning. Right. Wait here. Oh, Jim. How did this happen? I was there watching the barn burn. His heart did not resist. I'm sorry, Rannie. They were looking for Lorn. They searched the house and found the Sheriff. Then they told Pop that they would teach him a lesson. Perhaps they thought Lorn was in the barn. I have a problem to solve. You'll be fine? Pop is dead. Stay with her, Wahoo. It is not normal for Pipes to be late. Yeah let's go. Come on! Pipes! Better not touch me. Who was Pipes? Was it Calico? I want to sit. I think I walked more than I should have. I didn't believe I would walk... after they stripped me. They wait in the canyon. Be careful. Stay calm, friend. He can't hear you. Stay here, see you later. No way, I'm going with you. You heard Jim, the Major gave you command of the mission. Take care of Pipes. Yeah. Enough. Welcome. It's a pleasure to see you. It is in your house. You are under arrest, Calico, for murder. Murder? This is very serious. Who did I kill? It all started a long time ago. And it ended last night, with the shredding of a ranger. Let's go. Make a big mistake. I wouldn't hurt anyone. You are the first Ranger to set foot in this house. Last night there was another one here. Perhaps my men have seen him. Let's ask them. Beautiful guitar. That's all I have left of my mother. Pipes Benson, company D of the Texas Rangers. He pull his revolver. With the left. Leave the. Push it with your foot. We assumed that it would have taken another path. We're spoiling the surprise party. Do all rangers drive a guitar? Give me that rifle, Glyde. I always said that the best marks are in company D. Thank you Ranger. I couldn't have said that a week ago. But today as mayor, I think I speak for El Loso... when I thank the Rangers for bringing law and order. Well said, Phil! Well said, Phil! The man who, in our opinion, has all the qualities... that we admire, in a Texas Ranger. The citizens of El Loso, want to give you... this small sample of your thanks. For ranger Jim Dawkins. Thanks. This is too much for me. And yeah... Drinks are on me. For the Rangers! For the Rangers! To the Rangers. It looks good, doesn't it? Friend. Good job, guys. Now, keep your vultures out there. I will take care. Give me the bottle, I think I will need it. Buddy, let's forget everything. What you want? Let me leave this city as I left it. Clean. You changed. Call it what you. I like the Rangers. This is what you want? Yeah. Unless that doesn't change my friendship for you. I'm happy. Let's go, Wahoo. I... I think the same. I will stay with Jim. How cute. Sometimes I think I know them... and others I don't think so. Are you going out of town? I will not cross your path. Thanks. Good luck buddy. Yeah. Wait here. Thanks for the drink, Ranger. Good heavens! I am happy to see that you are overcoming what you have endured. Pop would like to see you like this. I have a surprise for you. Well, I have one for you. That's the surprise, he came back. I thought you said... I had to say goodbye, right? I told Lorn about the wonderful work you did. Yes, she told me everything. For me? Thank you, Jim. I'm came to... I wanted to ask you something. Tell me, Jim. I can come back later. No, this is good. I don't have to say anything that you can't hear either. Maya, hat I have, to tell you is not easy. I'm not very good at saying those things. It's crazy to ask someone, to live on $ 40 a month. É... Do you know what you are doing? A proposal. Thank you, Jim. The only reason someone rejects you is that... there is another person. And there? Maybe. But I want to make sure that you feel the same way I do. That's all, Jim. Yeah. I don't think I'll ever learn. For anyone, once is enough. But for me, it has to be twice. If you listen to me. You better get back, to the barracks. I am not proud of myself. Nobody should do that to Jim. He's used to it. Get my things back. I see nothing. Is weird. I feel like something is trying to squeeze my life... like the ties on an apron. We don't need strings. Get out. And never come back. Don't you dare come back. Because the moment I see you... It would have been better if he hadn't come back. $ 2,500 reward, for Lorn Remington. Did he take that off? Yes, sir, and he ordered me to say that... Say what? Not even the picture of my head... nor does the price they pay for it do me justice. Please fix everything. Where did you see him and when? He left me here, at the door. At our door? For all the saints! Dave, set up a patrol. It's Reming! It has just been at our door. Remington has not been more than ten minutes from here. Move! Lorn is not foolish. When he does something you notice it. He doesn't do the Rangers... but us. "5.000 DOLLARS OF LIVING OR DEAD LORN REMING" Rangers? Yeah. Lie on the floor, gentlemen. Face up. Steal our payroll under the noses of the best Eangers. Well, let's get this over with. Now. We also know how to set up traps. Her favorite trick. No passengers? Are there no Rangers? What's in this box, feathers? And now, I want answers. Did you see any Ranger on the road? No, but I think they'll be here soon. Who's there? What you want? What are you doing here? Mary, come help! And Rannie, did you go for a walk? It's not a big reception, for a man who has been patrolling for more than 48 hours. What happened? Will you deliver me? You know you don't. I do, my friend. I never did a job near here. You have become very famous. The only reason for coming here, is that there is nowhere else to hide. Do you know? You're really bothering Companhia D. There will come a point where we either kill you or recruit you. I vpu go back to the barracks. You'll be fine in a week. Are you going to leave without him? He'll be fine if you take care of him. Oh, right? Jim, you have to get out of here. Calm down, lynx. Rannie, there may be things that you can't understand. Delayed... but I understand now. I was hoping you would come back, friend. I lost. I will not come back. I'm going to shoot you out of that innocent $ 40 dollar job. You don't have enough bullets. But a lot of money in Laredo's bank. And part of it is yours. No thank you. Take care of him. Maybe I should give it to you. Try it. Did you want to see me, Major? Yes. As you know, we hunt a man. Any fat feet? Is. Lorn Reming. Huh. We located an Indian rancher who stole a horse a month ago. It's your big chance, Jim. Find it. I couldn't imagine anything like that. It will be better to explain. Ah, not much to think about. Is that really... I had thought about having, a small license. You will have, when you have solved this problem. Take four men. Choose who you want. I have to resign, Major. I didn't expect to hear that from you, Jim. You were doing great. You have a pending promotion. However, I accept your resignation. MacMullan. You'll be stuck, Jim. Because? Not so long ago you and Remington Lorn were two bad guys. You were and continue, to be good friends. Very good friends. Let's go, Mac. Hey, big head. Does it bore you to be out, or do you get tired of your friends? In this situation, it is not funny. You'd rather rot there than chase Lorn, right? Wahoo. Yeah? I think the friendship between Lorn and me... worth as much as anything else. Maybe... or maybe not much. I think my friendship with Lorn is not as strong as yours. Where are you going? Take a walk. Official business. I don't comment, with common criminals. Something important? Something like. I can get a promotion. Don't move, I'll see what I can do for you when I get back. See you later, sucker. You brought me uck for a change. What is the problem? I have to do something, to calm myself down. Your gorillas jumped on me. I'm sorry, Wahoo. I think that in my situation I must control my visits. I recognize that it does, things very well, Lorn. What's the business? I want to free Jim and explore this territory. I always wanted, to take what Calico left. But I gave Jim my word. We have thought of everything. How much booty will be n this area only. The El Loso bank alone will leave us 10,000 turkeys. And how do we free Jim? I'm in there, it'll be a cinch. Looks good. Let's look around. You will not see any Ranger here, friend. I didn't expect to see. But someone may have followed him. Did you get that Jim leave the rangers Don't be like other women. You can go out? I can try. Good. Listen, go to the city telegraph operator. Tell him to send a message, to Bailey that I'm going with Lorn. Let your men place, a kilometer from headquarters. This will come in alone. Understood? Understood. Wahoo, are you... Go away. You're going somewhere? I don't want you to leave without saying goodbye to Wahoo. Take it inside. Did you see Rangers? Do not. Not a shadow. Pleased? Yeah. Wahoo, I missed you. Really? A friend is always strange. I think you deserve, an extra portion of the spoils. Really? Wasn't it thanks to your efforts that we got back together? Well, sure, but you are the brain. You will have everything you deserve. And much more. I think you're overreacting. Let's clear this up. You want me and the boys to go into the barracks... and help you get Jim out? That's right. Are you sure he didn't agree to lock me up instead? Like the message you tried to send to Major Bailey. You discovered me, friend. I'm glad I don't have, to hide it anymore. Now I can put my cards, on the table. Me too. I should have known, I couldn't fool you, friend. Major Bailey, Major Bailey! They left before we saw who brought them. It's Wahoo. Greetings to the rangers... and that this serves as a warning. P. S: Jim, I send Wahoo back... so that you can give him a first-rate funeral. I feel unable to attend in person. Lorn. That pig. Francisco, lke, MacMullan... introduce themselves to the sector. Command, Major. I give you complete freedom, take it. Yes sir. Prescott, Cogswell, Gomez, head to Concho Country. On the move. Major! Major Bailey! Major Bailey! What happened? Let me go after him. I want to catch him! How will I know that you will not try to join him? This is Wahoo, Major. Lloyd. Lloyd, open the door. Yes sir. Hank, get Jim a horse. Yes sir. My revolver? Yours, for that. Too late, Jim. He's gone. I should imagine. Why are you here? Do you think, you know where he went? Rannie, I have to stop you. Wahoo? Yeah. It didn't give you a chance. It was brutal. Cold. We'll take you to the city. This is no longer a place for you. You are everything I thought he was. Now it is too late to tell you. No, it's not too late. But I need to do this first. She crossed the border, talked about going to California. I will bring it. Let him go. If you find him, there will be another death. I know there will be. It will kill you like it killed Wahoo. When you least expect it. When you have your back. Can it be like this. Jim, go back to the barracks. Tell them he left the state. It is the only thing that matters to rangers. Rannie, I'm doing this for Wahoo. You left me like a rag, but you got rid of it. I didn't do it for you. You heard me say to Jim... of an animal that kills at will. You were truly inspired by California. And I think it's convenient to take it with me. Oh no. You have to run, not me. Okay, so I'm staying. Jim will be back. This is what you want, right? May we meet. When do we leave? There is nothing that I would not do for him, right? Well, we have some savings to collect. Hello. I knew you wouldn't go without this. Half is yours, if you still want it. All I want is for you to come with me. I would love. But we always work things out with a drink. This is something that has no solution. But we can still have a drink. Clear. One sip. Two. Doubles. Yes sir. It's early. Yeah. Yeah. As he said, it is a little early. I've always liked you, Jim. I liked you too, Lorn. And Wahoo. I'll tell you. You didn't come here with tricks. Tell me bluntly. I gave up on the Rangers, so I wouldn't have to go after you. Wahoo took my place. But, now I don't resign. Either you come with me in peace and bring your money, or... Or what? Or you will come as Wahoo. Jim, you are crazy. Draw your gun, count to three and I'll still win from you. Yeah, you are fast... but that doesn't mean anything. This is no place for you, lady. Jim. Well, Lorn, we are going. Aren't you going to say hello, to Rannie? Jim, I know I lied to you. I wanted you to stay out. Let him go. I make sure you don't come back. Go, I won't be long. Come on! Jim. You better go, Rannie. Pick it. I thought about that. You like Rannie and she is in love with you. I leave them, Jim. What do you say now? I say we will. I'm leaving, Jim. Goodbye. Turn around. Don't go through that door. Are you ready friend? Jim! Drop the gun! It will be better for you, Lorn, if you come with me! I'm going out, Jim! "THE END"
