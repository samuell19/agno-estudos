- [Announcer] The programming usually featured at this time will not air today so that we may broadcast the following live report. (mysterious music) - [Reporter] They took off 30 minutes ago from a strip at Edwards Air Force Base. America's first space shuttle, the Enterprise, is flying piggyback onboard a jumbo jet. Today we are making a little bit of history. And this, they tell us, is the crossing of a threshold to the future. Together we have entered a radical new sort of Space Age. Today America is leading the way in beginning to harness space for all mankind. (engine roaring) (light guitar music) - [Man] Are you excited? - [Boy] Yeah. (chattering on radio) - [Man] Good, you should be. (chattering on radio) You have to celebrate your country. See anything yet? - It's all blue. - That's what we get for coming out here instead of right by the base. Better crowd out here, though. Should be right over those mountains. You're too young to be interesting. At least you're too young to admit you are. (chattering on radio) - Those give you cancer. - Sometimes you have to make your own choices in life. Screw what people say. (coughing) - You're gonna be a good man someday. A real good man. (chattering on radio) I know that. (engine roaring) - I see it. (chattering on radio) - [Man On Radio] Altitude 27. Air speed 239. (chattering on radio) (light guitar music) - [President Bush] Some citizens wonder, after 11 years of living with this problem, why do we need to confront it now? We've experienced the horror of September the 11th. We have seen that those who hate America are willing to crash airplanes into buildings full of innocent people. Our enemies would be no less willing, in fact, they would be eager, to use biological, chemical, or a nuclear weapon. Knowing these realities, America must not ignore the threat gathering against us. Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun, that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud. (dog barking distantly) (insect buzzing) (groans) - So tired. (sighing) I need a shower. - No, don't go. Stay. I'm gonna come with ya. - I need room to shave. You have to get Judith ready. - No. (phone ringing) (groans) (sighing) - Hello? This is his wife. One sec. - This is Brian. Mike, hey, yeah, no, it's really good to hear from you, thanks for calling. (somber guitar music) Yeah, yeah. Been in shipping in district since '94. (door closes) Yeah. No degree, no. I dropped out after a couple years. Geology. Well, I found that I could make more money managing people than rocks, so. I'm very interested in the position for sure. Wow. By the end of the month is gonna be tricky. No, it's a big move, and I got an eight-year-old, and DC's not exactly around the corner from California. To be honest, I need a day or two to talk about it with my wife so we... I'm sure it's not gonna be a problem. We can be flexible when we need to be flexible. I will let you know as soon as I know, okay? Okay. Thank you. (lighter clicks) - Dad? Have you seen my snake? - Since when do you got a snake, Gromit? - His name is Phil, he lives in our back yard. - Yeah, you should probably be careful with the snakes, they can be poisonous. - It's just a king snake. - Hon, it's kinda late. You gonna eat? - [Brian] No, I'm not hungry. - Okay. Who was that calling? - Just work. (dog barking distantly) - [Ramona] Judy, you need to pack your back for Tito's. - I'm looking for my snake. - His name is Phil. - What are you doing playing with snakes? - He was in our back yard. - Yeah, okay. I don't want you playing with snakes. - He's probably lonely. - She says it's just a king snake and she knows the difference. - The car in 10. - Hey, you might wanna check over by those bushes, 'cause they like the shade. - [Judith] Thanks Dad! - Brian. Maybe Omaha shouldn't this end early. - Get her done now, and then you guys take off. - Why are you limping? - I got another ingrown toenail. My boot's all packed with gauze and shit. - Go see a doctor. - I don't have to see a doctor, I just need to get in there and dig it out some. - Jack, do it. - I will. - Cigarette? - Thanks. (lighter clicks) - I gotta take off early, all right? Just wrap things up for me, okay? - I'll handle it. (light music) - [Reporter] Investigating a string of sniper shootings in the DC area. (country music and TV chatter overlapping) - Hey. Who the fuck are you? - That's Charlie. Comes to work with me sometimes. Rub under his neck, he likes that. (chuckles) - That stuff freak you out? (country music and TV chatter overlapping) - Not really. That's why I got this. Can I get you another round? - No, thanks, I'd love to, but. - Right there with you, boy-o. - What's up with the toothpicks? - Started in the 1940s, World War II. Each one was put up by a soldier going off to war. So when he comes home, he takes it out, gets a free drink. - What about the ones that are still up there? - I'll get your tab. The next time you're in, come and sit at the bar. We'll keep talking. - Okay. (country music and TV chatter overlapping) - [Jessica] See you tomorrow. - Thanks Jessi. (knocking) (chickens clucking) (speaking foreign language) Are you ready to go, honey? - I'm not done. - [Ramona] Oh, no? - Okay, we can pick up where we left off tomorrow, huh? - Okay, pack your bag, baby, I need to talk to Tito. (speaking foreign language) - Kiss for Tito? (chuckles) - Can we get some ice cream? - Aha, there is ice cream in the freezer. Bye Dad. - Buh bye. - Come on, you. - [Man On Radio] There's certainly also a lot of calls in the area with regards to shootings, shots fired, they are all being responded to by the police. I wanna stress that none of them have been found to be related to the shooting. But we also admit that everyone is edgy, things that may normally be overlooked are certainly getting a higher response from people and their anxiety. (dog barking distantly) - Dad? - Yeah. - What's five times eight? - 40. - Oh. Thanks. - That a new purse? - I just haven't used it in a while. - What happened to that pink one? - Nothing, just a change. (dog barking distantly) - [Judith] What's four times nine? - Shouldn't you be doing this yourself? Mm-hmm. Someone tipped a 10. - Must've thought you were cute. - Hmm. - Busy day? - Business keeps moving along the interstate. - What's seven times nine? - 56. - 63. - I was close. - I worked all day to make it fly. It looked so sad, I don't know why. But then I found some paint, and then I found a brush, and all around me in the garden, there fell a sudden hush. With just a little color, the scrap wood bloomed with flowers. Then I heard Mom holler. She said it was long past sleeping hour. (insects chirping) You passed out early. - What time is it? - It's after nine. (Brian sighs) You know you stuck Judith with Dad for like 10 hours today. - Sometimes I gotta work late. - Yeah. We're lucky to have him. Good night. (switch clicks) - Something happened today. - [Ramona] Can we talk about it tomorrow? - Tell me that you love me. - You're scaring me. - I got a promotion. It's the kind of promotion that's gonna lead to other promotions. - [Ramona] Okay. - They want us to move out to DC by the end of the month. Say something. - What do you want me to say? - I didn't think that I'd get it. - I mean, it's amazing that you got a promotion, it's great, but Brian, you haven't thought about this. Those shootings have been on every channel. - This kinda work, we could stay put and we could think about buying something. - You want Judith growing up in a city? Away from her Tito. She won't be like us. - Good! We could move to the moon and she'd be happy as long as she had a box of crayons. - I can't do this. - I really need this, Ramona. - [Ramona] I'm going to sleep. - Are you fucking kidding me? - [Ramona] Good night, Brian. - Mom? Dad? I can't sleep. - [Brian] Coming, sweetie. (light country music) - [Judith] Can I tell you something? - [Brian] Yeah, what's up? - [Judith] I think I'm gonna dye my hair blue. - You're gonna have to ask your mom. - Emma did it. But she's in sixth grade. - That sounds pretty punk. You like where we live? - Yeah. - Do you ever wanna live in a city? - Not till I'm 30. - [Brian] If we lived in the city, you could get a bigger room. - I like our house. I'm going to sleep now. - I love you. - I love you too. Good night. (truck beeping) - It's just gonna be hard for us to come before this sniper stuff's done. I mean, my wife, she watches the news, it's rough for her, seeing that with a daughter, it's... Of course, you gotta fill the position when you gotta fill it. No, thanks, I do, I think it's a good fit. I understand, and I will have an answer for you tomorrow. Thank you, thank you. (muffled country music) (people chattering) - Man, I am hung over today, boy-o. - I got a feeling I'm gonna tie one on tonight? - Yeah? - I got a promotion. - That is something to celebrate. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - I get to move to DC, I'm gonna manage the whole east coast. - Man. I wanna come with you. - You could. You could come. You'd be my drinking buddy. - It's tempting. - It's really sweet. My wife and kid aren't so hot on the idea. - [Annie] Oh, you got a kid? - Yeah, she's eight. Comes from my wife's first marriage. But as far as Judith's concerned, I'm the real thing. - [Annie] That's really nice. - It's neat. - Check up on you in a bit. (muffled country music) - [Ramona] Where were you when I got home? - At the bar. - [Ramona] You're that guy now. - Yep. (door closes) (door closes) (Ramona sighs) (knocking) I hate this house. - [Ramona] I think it's pretty. - Hola. - Hi. - Welcome. - How long has it been? - Too long. Brian. - Hi, hi. - Nice to see ya. There you go. - Great, thank you. - Welcome. All right. It's really good to see you guys. - How are you, Brian? - Good. Well. - [Man] And Ramona, how about you? - We just started looking to buy a house. - [Woman] Congratulations. I'm sure Judy has outgrown the trailer. - Yeah, she's gotten real big, that's for sure. - And with my dad, I don't know how long he's gonna be able to manage on his own, so. - [Woman] You'd have him move in with you guys? - [Ramona] I can't imagine him anywhere else. - [Man] If I had to live with her parents, they'd drive me crazy. - So did you guys hear the news about DC? - Six dead. Sicko. - He's a heck of a shot. - Heck of a shot, you bet. - So much violence. That's what I hate about cities. - [Man] It was probably the same fuckin' rag head. - Mark. - [Mark] What? - All they had was a white box truck. - All they needed was box cutters. - This isn't that. - You know what, you should get a gun. I bought one over a year ago and I feel safer about it. - It's a nice security blanket to have. - [Ramona] We don't need a gun. - He's excited about it. Let him have his fun. - Tell you what. After dinner, I'll let you hold it. - Okay. - Colt .45, from World War I. - Nice. - It's more than nice. Six shots, .45 caliber rounds, this right here's a piece of history. Go on, take it. How's it feel? - Light. - Yeah, I know. Be careful, that thing packs a punch. Go on, point it out there. Get a feel. - I don't know about these things. - Any man with a daughter needs this type of protection. There's some freaky shit out there. Go on. You go shooting, I guarantee you'll be sold. (imitates gunshots) Nice. - [Hillary Clinton] Because today, Mr. President, we are asked whether to give the President-- - Look at that. - [Hillary Clinton] Of the United States authority-- - The scablands made 20,000 years ago when a massive ice dam collapsed, letting an inland sea flow on that land. All those ripples in the rocks carved just like sand on a beach. - [Hillary Clinton] And its nuclear program. - Can you imagine 2000 feet? - I can. Sort of. But my father would tell you that was impossible. - How so? - Well, because this blessed world wasn't here 20,000 years ago. (chuckling) I mean, if you choose to believe all that hoo-ha. - [Hillary Clinton] Many have contacted my office about this resolution, both in support of and in opposition to it, and I am grateful to all-- (sighs) - Baby, I've been thinking about DC. You know I would never want you to miss out on something because of me. It's not what love is. - You wanna go? - Well, I want you to go. If that's what's best for you. - You don't think I'm making a mistake? - You could get outta here. Get a dog. Go for a drink every once in a while, it'd be nice. - Without you? - I don't know what's best for you, but DC isn't best for me or Judith. Not right now. Maybe after things settle down. Maybe after she's older and Dad's gone. - When Diego's gone? How long you wanna wait? - I don't know, but not right now. That's all I can say. - Are we gonna stay married? - Well I'll still love you. How can you look me in the eye and say we have to stay together when you leave. - Okay, I don't wanna be with anybody else. So is this me? - You missed the point. - I heard it. (dog panting) (muffled light rock music) (horn honking) - [Brian] How's it going, gunslinger? - [Annie] Are you ready for this? - I suppose so. - All right, one sec, let me get my purse. Ready to try? - I'll watch first. - All right. So you cock it right here, and you gotta make sure that the safety is on as soon as you're done shooting. There's some kickback, so be ready for that. Don't put the barrel in the dirt and don't point at anything you don't want dead. Don't hold your breath, keep both eyes open. (chuckles) (gunshots banging) - I hit anything? - Don't think so. (gunshot bangs) (exhales) (gunshots banging) (laughing) (clapping) - I hit something! - Good job. - Huh? - Nah, keep it for a little bit. Practice so you won't be shit next time. Let's open a beer. (muffled oldies music) - Hi honey. I'm too drunk to drive home, so I'm just gonna sleep it off in my car. I'm sorry too, but we won't do that again. We're gonna talk more on it tomorrow. I love you too. - Bad news? - No, good. Cigarette? - Sure. Let me just wash my hands. I just remember thinking how ridiculous it was that I got so upset over something that turned out to be nothing. I don't cry like that anymore. Do you cry much? - Not in a long time. I can kinda make the face. If I make the face long enough, I start to get this feeling in my nose. (laughs) And if I concentrate on that long enough, I get tears. But I gotta really try. - Yeah, that sounds like a lot of work. - [Brian] It is a lot of work. (chuckling) - I guess you should just smile then. (phone ringing) (somber guitar music) - Mike, yeah, it's Brian calling. Sorry it took me so long to get back to you, it's a big decision, so. But I talked to my wife about it, and it looks like we're gonna do it. So we really are. I should be out there in a couple of weeks, and I can't wait to get started. Thanks, Mike. (groans) - Shouldn't sleep outside. You'll get bit by something. - I didn't wanna wake you up. - There's spiders out there. I saw one in a hole the other day. - I wasn't sleeping in a hole. - You're in a nasty mood. - I'm not. - Sorry. - We should go to the Salton Sea. - You wanna go on vacation? Now? - Not on vacation. To the Salton Sea. - When? - Today, we should go today. - What about Judith? - Diego won't mind. We both need to start doing things different. - This isn't about DC, is it? You know how I feel. - We need to spend some time together. - [Ramona] I'm not driving. - I'll do it all. Trust me. - Okay. I trust you. (muffled country music) (man singing indistinctly) - Is he okay with it? What did you say? - I told him the truth. (light guitar music) (man singing indistinctly) - Feels good. To be moving, out of the mountains, towards something else. You think? - It's hotter than last time. Can we stop soon? - Sure. Yeah. This stretch reminds me of the shuttle landing. - [Ramona] That was out here? - No, it was the other direction, back at Edwards Base, you know, the Mohave. My dad woke me up early, it was still dark out, and he said "we're going on a drive." I don't even know if he told my mom, I just remember she was really mad when we got back. - [Ramona] I know the story. - Let me tell it again. By the time we got there, the shuttle was already in the sky, it was just like a little white speck. Barely make it out. I don't know why, but my dad told me I was gonna be a good man. The shuttle landed, a crowd waved and cheered, and they had flags. Just felt so natural at the time. Patriotic, but not cheesy. Everyone was so excited. They were proud. I don't think this is what they expected. (camera clicking) - Thanks Jack. That'll be good training for you. I'll call you Tuesday, just call me if anything gets crazy. All right. - So I guess next stop is dinner? - Yeah. We could explore around here. That's pretty cool. - [Ramona] I guess. - We don't have to. - Let's do it. It's creepy! - [Brian] No. Hello! - [Ramona] Hello? (suspenseful guitar music) How long do you think it's been since anybody's been here? - Not that long, probably. (gasps) - Don't do that! (laughs) - Stop hitting me. - What are these? - Kids suck on 'em, they get high. (insects buzzing) We need to go now. - Why? - We need to go now. Now, we should go now! (Ramona laughing) (muffled country music) It was on this ride that I first fell in love. - [Ramona] We were on our honeymoon. - [Brian] Became a deeper kinda love after that. - We were so clever. Honeymooning at a $30 a night motel. Near a city that no one's ever heard of. - [Brian] It was our finest hour. (laughing) - [Ramona] I'm hungry. How much further? - [Brian] There's a map in the glove box. - What the fuck is this? - It's Mark's, I just borrowed it so I could practice. - Practice what? Jesus Christ. - I wanna know that I could do something if I had to. - Do what? You gonna fucking kill someone? Are you John Wayne now? Fuck. Do not take that out again. Fucking kidding me. (light muzak) - You're right. It's hotter than last time. - A gun, Brian? I can't believe you. - Why's it so hard to believe? - What if Judith would've found it? You're giving it back. - Of course I am. I can't even hit anything with it. (laughs) - You tried? Even better. (muffled country music) ♪ Alone with all my sorrow ♪ ♪ It's so hard to be ♪ - Where are we? - We're overlooking the sea. ♪ Because I know ♪ You know, the sea sits directly on the San Andreas fault. It's overdue. The earthquake that swallows Los Angeles is gonna start right here. - You're so dramatic. (yawns) (light guitar music) (camera clicking) - Why you taking those? - I wanna see what's changed. Smile. (camera clicks) What are you looking at? - The desert. - What are you thinking about? - It smells like eggs. We should get drunk. I wanna get drunk. Tequila. - Sure. I'm gonna change first. I'm hungry. Could you get us some food? - Sure. - [President Bush] Well first of all, it is a form of terrorism, but in terms of the terrorism that we think of, we have no evidence one way or the other, obviously, but any time anybody is randomly shooting, randomly killing, randomly taking life, it's cold-blooded murder, and it's a sick mind, it's obviously loves terrorizing society. - Had to go all the way to India. - I'm exhausted. - Can I borrow your toothbrush? - Did you forget yours? Use your finger. (sighs) (somber guitar music) - 100 years ago, the Colorado River was diverted into a system of irrigation ducts and canals. When the river fused, it ran to spanks and rolled downhill and rushed across the desert until it found the Salton slick. The river pooled there and formed a sea where the day before there had been none. When fish were introduced to the lake by 1920, it was a major tourist destination. - I read that last time we were here. You gonna eat your fries? - [Brian] Yes.

Joey has a ton of cuts and bruises. Goes way too fast. (laughs) - Can I jump rope with you? - Yeah. (Ramona chuckling) - [Ramona] Thanks. - Miss Susie had a steamboat, the steamboat had a bell, when Miss Susie went to heaven, the steamboat went to hell. - Hello operator, please give me number nine. - [Girl] Faster! - And if you disconnect me, I'll kick up in the behind the fridgerator, there was a piece of glass, Miss Susie sat upon it, and broke her little ask me no more questions, and tell me no more lies, the boys are in the bathroom, zipping up their flies are in the meadow, the bees are in the park, Miss Susie and her boyfriend are kissing in the D-A-R-K. (laughing) (clapping) Thank you. This is like Southern California after the bomb. This place could've been huge. - Maybe. - No, like rival Palm Springs. Sinatra sang at the scene, Beach Boys. - It's a far cry from Palm Springs. - No, I can see it. There's water skiing, colorful drinks. I don't know, I kinda like it like this, quiet. It's nice. - This whole city just for us. - Think they have any cops? - I don't know. Think they need 'em? - [Ramona] Maybe. (muffled country music) - The snipers want money delivered to a drop-off. - Can we not talk about the news, please? It makes me sad. - Okay. It's important to know. - I get by just fine without it. - Hey guys, how's it going? You from an island? - No, Yucca Valley. - Ah, Yucca Valley. Yeah, I have a sister who lives near there. Hey, I'm Hank. - Brian and Ramona. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, guys, you know I hate to bug ya during your meal and all, but I'm just looking for someone to help me out. I've got a son down in Brali. He's a cute kid, six years old. If I don't get down there this weekend, his mama's gonna call the judge, and I won't even get that. My buddy, he says he'll give me a ride, but he needs money for gas, and well, 20 bucks, huh? - We got nothing. - Come on, man. I'm not looking for a handout, I'm good for it, I just need it till Sunday. Ask the bartender, talk to Roger, he'll tell ya. - [Ramona] Here's 10. - Oh, hey, thanks a lot. - Have a good time with your son. - [Hank] Of course, thanks. - Fuck that guy. Gonna go and smoke some speed. - You know, if that's what he needs, I'm fine with it. - Okay, you're fine with it. - I guess I am. (waves lapping) (Ramona sighs) That air is so clear. You can see forever. God, you can see the mountains, we live in those mountains and you never see them. - There's a lot that we don't see. We need something big. You know, a big decision that we can just sit in the middle of. I took the job in DC. They need me there by the end of the month. - I hope you find everything you're looking for. - You're coming with me. I need you. - Stop and think about what I need. - Okay. What you need. You need money to live and for Judy. You know, you work for tips, Ramona, still. I asked Judy and she says that she wants to come. - Why would you ask an eight-year-old about this? God, you think that DC is the solution to all your problems. - I want something to be proud of! A good job, a house, a tree in some stupid skinny yard, I want a family! DC is what I wanted my whole life. - Judy and I don't make you proud? We're not enough? - Do you ever wonder what a kid of our own would look like? - Fuck you. (train rumbling) (sighs) - I miss you. - [Ramona] I just can't keep doing this. I'm shutting down. - I love you. - [Ramona] Loving me doesn't make you right for me. I'm gonna get changed. (sighs) - It's Brian. Sure, it was what we needed. Can you... Yeah, I just wanna say good night to her. Hi Gromit. What did you do today? Huh? That sounds fun. Oh yeah? What'd that look like? That's pretty awesome. Yeah, we're gonna come home tomorrow, but it's not gonna be till very late. I miss you too. I really really really do. You have a good sleep. Okay, good night, sweetie. (phone hangs up) (Brian grunts) - [Ramona] You're grinding your teeth. - [Brian] Was I? - [Ramona] Go back to sleep. (somber guitar music) (water running) (crying) (door opens) - [Brian] I love you. - How did it feel fucking me like that? Fucking me like you hate me? Like you were pounding a nail in the wall and it bent, and you just kept going anyway. - Ramona. - I can tell you a million things about you never cross your mind. I can tell when you love me and when you don't, just by your eyes. You don't know what you want. If you wanted to go to DC, you would be there. You wouldn't let me stop you. Because you're too scared of what's right in front of you. (light guitar music) - Hey. Mike, it's Brian. I apologize, I've been away with my wife. Look, it seems that I accepted the position too soon. It's just not a good time for us to come to DC, I'm sorry. I understand. Look, just thank you for considering me. Maybe some other time. - [Ramona] Thank you. - Yeah. (light guitar music) Cigarette? - No, I'll just share yours. (lighter clicking) I like it when you smile. - I'm okay. - We have a good life. And I'm happy, Judith is happy. Isn't that the point? Are you happy? - I suppose I am. - Then you made the right choice. You don't have to worry. You're a good man, you know that, right? - I don't know. (sighs) (groans) - Morning baby. - I think I'm gonna die today. - What? - I'm gonna die today. - Are you serious? How do you know? - I don't know. I can just feel it from here. - Wait, like a heart attack? - No. It's like an inkling. (sighs) - Baby, you're fine. You just need a couple days. Church is soon. You should do something with Judy today. (panting) I gotta shower. - Okay. - You can join me if you want. - Okay. (panting) - [Priest] The fact is that Jacob loved all of his children. He had 12 sons in all, and in time, each of these sons was to be the father of one of the tribes of the nation of Israel. He raised all of them, and taught them to be respected citizens. Jacob taught them the ways of the Lord, and was a father who deeply cared. He provided for his children, and spend time with each of his sons and his daughter, training them to be successful in life. - Good sermon today, huh? - Yeah. - Something on your mind? - Just wanna get outta here. - I hear you got a big job offer. - Yeah, a big one. - What does Ramona think about it? - I guess you know what she said. - Ready to go, honey? - Yeah. - [Judith] I love you. - Come on, you guys. (somber guitar music) Hey Gromit. How's that drawing? - [Judith] Good. I'm having a lazy day. - [Brian] Is that for Mom? - [Judith] It's a surprise for when she gets back from work. - That's real nice. You know I'm proud of you, right? You're a good girl, and you're gonna be a good woman too. You wanna go somewhere? I got somebody I wanna introduce you too, she's got this big dog named Charlie. - Will we be home in time for dinner? - Oh yeah. No, we'll be home before Mom. Charlie's gonna be happy to see you. (light rock music) How was last night? Pretty good for a Sunday? - Thanks there, boy-o. You, unfortunately, like, good. (chuckles) Hi, I'm Annie. - [Judith] Hi. - Come on, sweetie, sit down, okay? - Why? - [Brian] Because you're gonna break your neck. - Why? - Because everything is gonna break your neck, so just sit down and Annie's gonna whip you up a nice cup of hot chocolate. - Fine. Doggie, come here. - She's pretty great. - She seems it. So I went to this bar once, in DC, it had sawdust all over the floor, real cowboy kinda place. Maybe you can take me there sometime. - Any time we can make it out. (chuckles) - You must be excited. When do you take off? - Last day of the month. - Well, if you don't tell anyone, I'll let you put a toothpick up in the ceiling. How about another one? - Yes. - So I'm thinking, on Monday, if it's slow, I'll close up early, and we'll go out. - Let's go to that place with the sheep's head. - That one, and this other one you're gonna like. (dog barking) (Judith screaming) - Ow, ow! - He's never bitten anyone before. What do I do, I'm so sorry Brian! - Open the door! You're gonna be okay, sweetie. Just keep that there. - Should I call the hospital? I'm so sorry, Brian! - Put that fuckin' dog down. (Judith crying) - [Annie] I'm sorry. - You were supposed to be watching her. 10 stitches, Brian. Come home or don't. I don't care. 10 fucking stitches! Give me a cigarette. (somber guitar music) (breathing heavily) - Hi. Hi. Hi. (dog whining) (Brian crying) (dog whining) (muffled light rock music) - I guess it could mean many things. - What's that? - Being a good man. - It can. But this is what your dad meant. - You ready to go? - Yeah. An hour to go. Sure you're okay to drive? - [Brian] Yeah, I'm good. Just keep the radio on. Can I put on the news? - [Ramona] Sure. - [Man On Radio] Throughout this horrible ordeal, the residents of this community proved that faith and hope always triumphs over darkness and despair. - [Reporter] Tonight, the people of the Washington metropolitan region are breathing a collective sigh of relief as police have made arrests of two suspects they believe are responsible for the deaths of 10 people. - [Man On Radio] We've all experienced anxiety, but in the end, we have not given in to the terror.
