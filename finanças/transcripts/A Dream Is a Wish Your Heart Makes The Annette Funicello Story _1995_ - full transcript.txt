(children chattering) Hey, that one's mine. Give it back! Hey now, you rascal! This is a wedding day and there's going to be a big reception in this room later. So it's out of bounds until you see a bunch of adults laughing and singing and dancing. Out you go. Sorry about that, Virginia. How's Gina doing? Virginia: Nervous as a bride can be. How's Annette? Man: Just as happy as the mother of the bride can be. How are you? Is "grandmother of the bride" an official term? Man: It is in this house. Oh! Hello. What's your name? -Heather. -Heather? Well, Heather, your friends are outside. They're not my friends. What do you mean? Won't they let you play with them? Why not? 'Cause I'm too shy. They don't play games that shy girls like? Oh. Come with me, why don't you. Hi. Annette: Hi! Who have we here? Her name is Heather. She's a soulmate of yours. She's shy. Can she stay with you? Well, we shy ones have to stick together. Heather, will you stay with me? What's your favorite thing? My doll. What do you like to do with your doll? Tell stories. What's your favorite story? Cinderella. Really? That's my favorite, too. Really? Maybe you're Cinderella. That's silly. You want me to tell you a Cinderella story? Okay. Well, this story is different than the ones you've heard. This story starts in the city of... Young Annette: ...Utica, New York, just after the Second World War, which was a long time ago. Uncle Pete: You're going to California in this? -Joe: You bet! -Maria: Why is this the first we've heard about it? Old Man: Because they knew it would be a big fuss, like this. Virginia, this is pazzo! Oh, pazzo, that's good. "Crazy" sounds better in Italian. Crazy is crazy. California is a place you visit for a few days. -When you're older! -Well, we don't wanna wait till we're older. We wanna live there now. -Uncle Pete: Why? -what's in California? Well, I don't know, Mom, that's why we wanna go there. Do you have a place to stay there? No. Joe, you got a job, huh? Uncle Pete, you wanna stop? Here, Joe's Auto Repair is bringing in good money. You got a nice home, you got family. Friends who care about you. Mama, we're young. We want to see what there is to see and do what there is to do. We got plenty of time later to get settled and old. But you're throwing away security. Enough Maria, enough. They have a dream... not so different from the one we had, remember? "Go west, to America, make a new life." We did it. Now they do it. Then, it was the Bronx. Now, it is California. (chuckles) They're following the sun. They are not going to fall off the edge. All right, go. You want surprises? You'll get them. Uncle Pete: You'll be back. You'll be back. You'll be back in Utica before Christmas. Jeez! (sighs) Maria: Poor little Annette, all alone in California. Young Annette: Then, like in any good fairy tale, this particular Cinderella's parents had to go and see a fortune teller. I see a journey, a long journey. See? Eh, they always say that. Joe. You are traveling across the country. All the way to California. Oh, my God! Well? Well? Oh, I don't know. It's pretty good. Except that we only told every one of our 200,000 relatives, some of whom are probably her relatives too. Shh, please. You will live and prosper in California... -There you go. -...and you will have another child in California. (chuckles) Thanks, but two is enough. A boy. And-- and he will be famous. Really? He will be beautiful. I hear him singing, and singing. -A singer? -Yeah. Your child will be embraced by the world. And then, a cloud... a deep secret, a hurt. What? What is it? Nothing. Well, is the journey gonna be okay? There will be some problems, but, uh... What? What problems? -An illness. -Who's gonna get sick? Don't worry, huh? Don't worry. I'm sorry, I, uh... I can see no more. Yeah. Right. How much, uh... do I have to give you? Thank you. Oh, no, no, please. I don't accept money. Just give something to the poor. California will be wonderful. Thank you so much. Thank you. Huh? So, what, you're not convinced? You're convinced, don't tell me you're not convinced. (kisses) Come on, let's go. Come on, a journey, California. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A baby, a baby boy... Joe: I can't believe how big this country is. We've been on the road forever and we're only in Ohio. Young Annette: Ma remembers that that extra person with us on the trip was the fortune teller. Joe, come in here, will you, please? -Take a look at this. -What is it? Chicken pox. Illness? The fortune teller was right. That's okay. Hey, then she said we'd live and prosper. -Yeah. -Mm-hmm. And then a cloud. -You still wanna go? -Sure, don't be pazzo! We're gonna go to California and make a baby. ♪ Eliminate the negative ♪ ♪ Latch on to the affirmative ♪ (inspirational music) -Joe: Come on, folks, let's take a look. -At what, Daddy? The promised land, honey. Annette: What did the land promise? Virginia: Everything, honey. -For you, Virginia. -Thank you, Joe. (girl laughing) Virginia: Annie! Annette! Hm. Honey, what are you doing over here? Go get in the game. -No. -Why? Come on, I'll take you. No, Mama... Young Annette: Mama thought I'd grow out of my shyness. (laughs) But I didn't. Like Cinderella, I've always been shy. I still am. I want Grandpa and Grandma. I know, you're homesick. But soon you'll go to school, you'll make a lot of new friends. I promise. Young Annette: One of the things Mama did to help was enroll me in a dance school. Joe: Are we going or not? Of course. Annette, what are you doing? -Come on! -Do I have to go? Honey, yes. It's your recital. Annette! What have you worked so hard for, honey? You don't want to let everybody down, do you? No. -Well, come-- (groans) -(telephone ringing) What, you're gonna get that? -It's Mama. -It's her weekly check-in to see how we like California. You're gonna say what we always say: "Mama, we like it." Come on, let's go. (sighs, groans) (ringing continues) What I don't tell Mama is it's just like Utica. ("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" by Tchaikovsky playing) (audience chattering) (man shushing) (whispers) What? Excuse me, would you mind very much? I really need to sit here. What's the matter? Are you okay? Are you all right? All these people. Feel my hands. Aw, honey. Look, put these on. You'll be fine once you start dancing. Here, here. Maybe I shouldn't do this. Really? Because, you know, you should only do it if you love it, and if it's fun, and it's a good way to make friends. (audience applauding) So, what do you think? I don't know, Mom. Oh, honey. Annette? Come on, honey. It's your turn. Because it's fun? Look, don't worry about the whole audience. Just dance for one special person. (scattered applause) ("Swan Lake" by Tchaikovsky playing) Miss Funicello. (inaudible) (music crescendos) (scattered applause) (loud applause) (telephone rings) (sighs) Hello? Virginia? Al Gilbert. Oh, hi, Al. Virginia, listen... Walt Disney was at the performance last night. You mean the Mickey Mouse man? I mean the head of Disney Studios. He's putting together a new kids show for television, and would like Annette to audition to be a Musketeer. Weren't the Three Musketeers all men? I remember Errol Flynn, Tyrone Power, was it? I-- (laughs) I don't think we're interested, Al. Virginia, it would mean a lot to me and the school to have a student auditioned by Disney. Oh, all right then, we'll talk it over. -Bye. -Bye-bye. (click, dial tone) No, Mama, I don't want to do it. Fine, honey, if you don't want to do it, we won't do it. I mean, they have their pick of the best dancers in Hollywood, why would they want me? Well, Mr. Disney saw you dance last night. I guess he liked you. No. No, I can't. It's fine, sweetheart. I-I'll call Al. W-What would they expect me to do at this audition? Dance. Later on I think there's gonna be some fencing. It's nothing to worry about now. Would you be with me? (chuckling) Of course! -Well, what do you think? -I think... it's something different, a great adventure, but it's up to you. Mr. Gilbert's been so nice to me. I'd hate to let him down. What's the worst thing that can happen? I wouldn't get to be a Musketeer? And you'd be no worse off than you are already. Okay. -Really? -Let's do it. (upbeat music) Finally, I'm out of Utica. (child playing accordion poorly) (music stops) Man: Thank you very much. (mispronouncing) Annette "Funisello." Walt Disney: Hello, Annette. It's nice to see you again. Hello. What are you going to sing for us today? Oh, I don't sing, I dance. Yes, we saw you dance, and it was very nice. Now we'd like to hear you sing, too. Just a chorus from any song. Um...

Honey, they asked us to wait. Take it easy. (door opens) Woman: Good afternoon. Mr. Disney's office. Annette Funicello, welcome to "The Mickey Mouse Club." You're going to be a Mouseketeer. A "Mouseketeer"? New word. Think it'll catch on? (chuckles) I sure hope so. What do you think, Annette? I think I can't believe that you picked me after you heard me sing. (chuckles) Well, I did. Come on, let's get to work. (upbeat music playing) Soundstage 4, where the Mouseketeer set is. -Mr. Disney. -Hi. Woman (over PA): ...report to Stage 4. So, you invented Mickey Mouse, huh? Well, let's say I discovered him. (laughs) Like you discovered me? I guess so, yes. Oh, this is a nice studio you've got. -Thank you. -You're welcome. She's never done this much talking to anyone, Mr. Disney, outside of the family. You must be a family member. (chuckles) I would consider that an honor. Me too. (Disney laughs) But I have to go now. I hope you'll like working here. I think I'm going to. Good. See you soon. -Good-bye. -Bye. Oh, Mom, look! What are those? I'm going to be on television? (chuckling) That's the idea. Oh, Mom. All those kids watching! Suppose I can't do it? You just showed them you can do it. That's why they picked you. Mom, I did it once. But every day, five days a week? With 23 other kids who are better than me? Annie, all our dreams of moving to California have been fulfilled. Our life here is wonderful, your dad's garage is doing great. We have our own orange tree. But it's okay to have new dreams, too. And if they can come true, that's fine, and if they don't come true, that's fine, too. You'll be there with me? Oh, sweetheart, I wouldn't miss it, would I? -No! -(giggling) (car honking) Young Annette: All summer, we rehearsed and rehearsed. We danced and we sang. And we started becoming great friends.

(theme song playing) (Funicellos laughing and chattering) (Joe laughs) Look, it's you! (giggles) Virginia: She looks so pretty! Look, it's Annette! Roll call! Annette! Moochie! Lesley! Skippy! I want a pair of those ears. Janet! Jimmie! Older Annette: I've said it many times before. I owe everything to these ears. Can I see them? Oh, you look so pretty. Straighten them out. Oh! -Oh, there. -Yes! You're a Mouseketeer! Man: Places, people! Good morning, Mr. Disney. Good morning, Annette. I'd like to change my name. Can I? I see. Well, we can't change "Annette," it's sewn into all your costumes. Oh! Well, I wanted to change my last name. To something easy. Everyone has trouble with it. Ah, but once they learn it, they never forget it. It's unique. It's like a song. (Italian accent) "Funicello." It's beautiful. Besides, if you change your name, what will we do about all the fan letters that are written to your old name? You're getting a lot of letters, my dear. Wouldn't want to plug up the whole mail department, would you? No, I wouldn't. You mean the letters for me would plug it up? There's lots and lots of them every day. -You know why? -Why? Because they like you. (giggles) Well, I guess it's not as bad as I thought. Still, it's up to you. Thanks, Mr. Disney. You're welcome, Annette... (Italian accent) "Funicello." Bill, Roy? (laughs) I love that. Young Annette: Mouseketeers all had to be accompanied by a parent, which was usually a mom, 9 to 5, six days a week. (Virginia vocalizing playfully) He doesn't want bread, he wants you to drive the truck. It was really hard on the family. My dad, of course, learned to cook, and Mom had a close friend watching my brothers during the day. We all worked together as a family unit. We were very strong. I never thought I'd be able to bake a cake. (laughs) I told you, nothing to it. Okay, baba, go ahead, blow it out. One, two, three! -(blows) -Yay! One more! One, two, three! -(cheering) -Happy birthday! (kisses) Young Annette: A lot of people didn't know that we Mouseketeers worked at Disneyland, and that we used to make public appearances. (excited chatter) I felt it was a privilege to bring a little happiness to people. Mama said it was a sign of maturing. I-I hope that everyone here has a very merry Christmas. Okay, Mouseketeers, it's time for us to go. Goodbye! Man: Bye, Mouseketeers. Bye, Annette! Annette: Merry Christmas! Can you... please stay? I'm sorry, I have to go. (sniffles) Young Annette: I was maturing in more ways that one. Even Cinderella grows up. (giggles) Thanks, Mom. (both laugh) I started doing TV serials. First, "Spin and Marty," and then my own, called "Annette," where I met Shelley Fabares. We are still the best of friends. -Oh, man, he's gorgeous. -Oh, gosh. (laughs) He has-- You could braid his tail, just like with your hair. Glen: Come on. Virginia: Happy birthday, honey. Annette: Oh, he's so beautiful, Glen. Young Annette: One of the great things about growing up is that people trust you with more and more responsibilities. Like owning a horse. You know, a famous rider once said, they're dangerous at both ends and uncomfortable in the middle. But if you're gonna go ahead and ride them, you better ride the best. Happy birthday, Annette. Thank you! Thank you! Man: Happy birthday. Take good care of her. (kisses) Thank you so much! Virginia: Is she gentle, Glen? Lifetime guarantee. Come on. Joe: Cheese! I loved my years at Disney Studio. I always found Mr. Disney to be somewhat of a shy person. But he was a real kid at heart. And I think that's why he wanted everyone to call him "Uncle Walt." (giggles) I feel so honored to have been a Mouseketeer. Do you know why I asked to see you, Annette? Because I'm too tall? For what? For the show. You have to fire me, is that right? No. Well, any part of it? Well, you are growing up. So, I guess being too tall is part of it. But you're not getting fired. In fact, I would like to sign you to a recording contract as well as a player contract. (chuckles) You would? It's time for new things, Annette. Making records could be a good transition for you, from child to teenager. Singing? (Disney laughs) When you sang on the show the other day, thousands of people called in and wanted to buy the record. I thought it would be a good idea if we made one or two... million. Oh! So, you mean new things as well as The Mickey Mouse Club? No, dear. We're gonna be shooting the last episode of that very soon. Last episode? But the studio wants to keep you under contract, though. If that's all right. And Sharon and Lonnie, and-- No, dear. You're the only one who's staying on. Oh.

Older Annette: It was one of the saddest days of our lives, and I speak for all the Mouseketeers. We truly were a family. -Hi. -Hi, can I listen to the story? Sure, come in. I wasn't part of a club anymore. It was like leaving Utica all over again. Moving away from another family, strictly on my own. I was scared to death. Wow, you were a really big star. How old were you? Sixteen, seventeen. -Cool. -Is it neat being a big star? Well, it was kind of scary. I mean, singing was never my favorite thing. But it was kind of fun. Awesome.

We were engaged, going to elope, secretly married. Was he your first real boyfriend? No, he wasn't. We kept missing our chances. Cinderella has to have a Prince Charming. Annette: And I did. And he was very charming. His name was Paul Anka. Was he your boyfriend? He sure was. (girl giggles) Teenaged Annette: He was always really mature for his age. We were all a little overwhelmed at first, even Mama. This is quite a place, Paul. I'm glad you like it, Mrs. Funicello. It's my favorite. I recommend the Veal Piccata, by the way. I'm thrilled you were able to come tonight. Yeah, me too. It was nice of you to ask. I don't believe anyone's ever asked Virginia and me out on a date with Annette before. It's an interesting approach. (chuckles) (laughs) Yes, sir. Well, the thing is, I wanted to get to know Annette, and I figured getting to know her family is the best way to get to know her. Oh, that's a lovely way to think. How old are you, Paul? Uh, I really love your songs, Paul. Paul: Thank you. Well, maybe you'd like to do one of them sometime? I would love to. Did you know Dick Clark was putting together a traveling show? -I heard something. -Yeah. It's called "Caravan of Stars." How would you like to join us? (gasps) Really? I already talked to Dick. In fact, the whole thing was his idea. Oh! (chuckles) Come on, you'll love it. How long would the tour be? -Six weeks, tops. -Oh, my! Annette and I have never been away from Joe and the boys for that much time. Well, maybe Annette should go on her own. Um, I-I couldn't do that. Um, I would be singing live in front of an audience. I've never done that before. It's time you did, don't you think? I mean, this tour can be a real challenge for you, Annette. And I think you're at that point in your career where you need to start taking challenges. Don't turn me down, now. Think about it. Please. (rock and roll playing) Paul: You know, it's so easy to get trapped as a singer, doing the same stuff over and over again, boring yourself and your audience to death. But it's different for you, because you do all that other stuff. You conduct and produce and everything. I can't stop. I know, you're just so much more driven than I am. I can't help it. I'm just happy to sing, "Jo-Jo The Dog-Faced Boy." Well, you're too easily satisfied. Look, you haven't found your true voice. That's all right, we'll work on it. We'll get you better material. You have to try jazz, blues, country. When you explore all the possibilities-- Hey! Explore the possibilities in the morning, will you, please? We're trying to sleep here tonight. -Uh-oh. -(both laughing) That was delicious, Mrs. Funicello. I'm glad you liked it. -Annette: It was delicious. -Thank you, Paul. Thank you both. You want to go in the living room and talk? Yeah. (Annette giggles) (groans) How come they don't have to help, huh? Well, you know, one of them's making movies all the time, the other one's on tour all the time. I thought, they never get to see each other. In the interest of romance they should... get off doing the dishes. What are you doing? Stop it. -Don't do that in the kitchen. -Yeah. (piano playing) Mm. I can't play when you're this close to me. (Annette giggles) What's this? It's for you. Joe: (whispers) Hey! Oh, Paul, it's beautiful. It symbolizes my heart. And now I've given it to you. -Come on, let's put it on. -I love it.

"The Longest Day." It's more like "The Longest Year." Hey, I know it's gonna feel like forever. But this is too good an opportunity. And I'm not just talking about the acting. Mr. Zanuck's giving me the opportunity to score my own film. Is that what this new machine is for? Yeah, I'm playing with this short film to show him what I can do. Paul... Stay. I can't. Look, I figure once I'm in Europe, I should play a few clubs. So, Syd booked me in Rome, Paris, Berlin. Maybe something in England. Oh, great, so I'm never gonna see you again. I hate this!

Paul, while you were away in Europe, I had a chance to do a lot of thinking about us. (sighs) And... I want to be married. And have children. I'm ready to start a family of our own. Look, Annette, in this business, your 20s and 30s are when you make it or you don't. -I know that, Paul. -Okay. So, let's get our careers to a nice, safe place, then we'll ease off, we'll worry about other things. But I love you. Don't you love the singing? I mean, the audiences, the excitement? -We can have it all. -But I don't want it all. But I do. I know. Okay. (sighs) You didn't just live happily ever after with Paul? No, I didn't. Is that the end of the story? Well, really, it's like the beginning. You know, at 18, I didn't know what happiness was. I didn't know who I was. I really didn't know what life was all about. I'm glad there's more story, but... did other things happen that made you happy? They sure did. Teenaged Annette: Life has a funny way of playing tricks on you. I didn't get to marry Prince Charming, but I did get to play a bride in Babes in Toyland. I do, I do, I do. Who wouldn't, huh? Oh, you better watch it, Frankie. I may just dig up a priest and hold you to that. Jack? Are you okay? You're beautiful. Thank you. It's the dress. What dress? Oh, you guys are good for a girl's ego. Hey, did you read the script to Beach Party? Yup. What's the deal? Sandra Dee not available? Very funny. Now, it's perfect for us. Frankie's right, Annette. I mean, when you were a Mouseketeer, you were every boy's first love, and every girl's best friend, but now... you've grown up. You're beautiful, warm... Now, speaking as one of them, the guys want that love affair to keep going. Oh, well, not all the guys. This thing can't miss. I mean, do you know how big California beach music is? Surfing? It's huge. I know, I like it. Just waiting to hear from Mr. Disney. -Oh, you are? -Oh, sure. Even if I wasn't under contract, I'd still ask his advice on everything. You would? Excuse me, Miss Funicello, Mr. Disney would like to see you right away. Okay, thank you. -Bye, boys. -Bye. (distant phone ringing) You look beautiful, Annette. Very grown up. Thank you. It's the dress. Is it? (clears throat) Sit down. (clears throat) I've read the script. Yes, sir. Not exactly the Disney style. We've never exposed a woman's navel before. At least, not a human navel. N-No, sir. I guess it's time to let you grow up. Uh, pardon? I think you'll have a wonderful time doing this picture, and I think you'll do a terrific job in it. -Really? -Really. (laughs) This is great! Thank you! I'm very proud of you, Annette. Well, none of this would have happened without you, Mr. Disney. You and those ears. You mean the mouse ears, I hope. Oh, you're ears aren't that big. You're just sensitive. (chuckles) Thank you, I'll try and remember that. But honestly, I'm just so grateful to you. All I did was help you be who you are. You just go on being true to yourself and you'll have all the happiness and success you deserve. Yes, sir. Thank you! (both chuckle) You're welcome. Remember me to your parents. I will. (poignant music) (pop music playing) Isn't this great, Dee Dee? I can't believe we're finally here, all alone, by ourselves, just the two of us. But don't you miss everybody? Absolutely not. Oh... Dee Dee, is there something you wanna tell me? Oh, Frankie, I just couldn't help it, the house is so big and everything, I invited everybody over. Oh, Dee Dee, how could you? Well, it's just more fun with the whole gang. Not what I had in mind. Well, would it make any difference if I told you I just don't trust myself to be alone with you? It hurts more. I'm sorry. Director: Cut! Print. Brilliant. -Fabulous. -(bell ringing) -(overlapping chatter) -Moving on. Next. (chatter continues) Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Isn't that my robe? Yes, it is. Aren't you my agent? Yes, I am. Does it seem normal for you to pay more attention to her than your client? -Yes, it does. -Oh-kay. -(giggling) -Let's go get Frankie! -Excuse me! -(women giggling) -You okay? -Yes, thank you. You don't want to join the crowd? Oh, no. I'm really not much of a joiner. I believe that about you. Listen, why don't you have someone to give you your robe? Where's your agent? He should be punished. I don't have one at the moment. -You don't? -Mm-mm. Well, how about me? -Seriously? -Yeah. I'd love to represent you. You've got a deal. Great! Oh, excuse my hand, it gets clammy when I get nervous. You sure it's you? Mm, pretty sure. I don't know. It might be me. So, I said, "Excuse me, Mr. MacMurray, I think you are standing on my eyelashes." (both laugh) Don't ever change, huh? Well, I don't know if I can promise that. No, I'm serious. I mean, you're everything I hoped you'd be. You're funny, you're--you're open, you're honest. Being here with you, it's like... It's like a dream come true. Virginia: What's going on in there? Um, Jack was just giving me a ride home from the studio. -Which led to us talking. -Right, and I was telling him-- Talk inside. Come in for dinner. You want to stay for dinner, Jack? Thank you, ma'am, but I should-- Manicotti. Deal. (pop song playing) (Annette giggling) -Well? -I have one question. -What? -Does Dee Dee's hair ever actually move, or what? Hey! So, take a look. How's it feel? It feels great! Now, the real question is, when do you start the sequel? And how much you're gonna get them to pay me. -That goes without saying. -Yeah. In fact, I've already got a figure in mind. -Really? -Yup. Yours. (chuckling) You're such a goof. (sighs) (giggles) They really liked it, didn't they? They loved it. And Frankie was great. Yes, and so were you. Oh... really? -They loved you. -Really? Really. And I love you. Really? Really. Look... I'm no Frankie Avalon, I'm no Paul Anka, I'm just an ordinary guy who happens to be crazy about you. I'm Italian, I'm Catholic, I want a family. And I love you. Do I have any chance? Yes. -Do you feel-- -Yeah, I do. I do. Uh... Will you marry me? (gasps) Um, you're gonna have to ask my father for permission. You're joking, right? Would I joke about something like this? You know, that's what I love about you, Annette. You're just an old-fashioned, beach party girl. -(giggles) -Come here. -(knocking) -Annie, your father's here. Oh! Annie, you're so beautiful. Thank you. Did you see the roses that Mr. Disney sent? Mm. Isn't he amazing? Even when he's so ill, he's still thinking of me. They're lovely. Annie, your father and I didn't have much of a wedding, but it was a wonderful day just the same, and we've never regretted it. And your grandmother gave me this that day, and now it's my turn to give it to you. St. Anne. It's your namesake. Mom, it's perfect. Thank you. I hope that you and Jack will be as happy as your father and I have always been. I know we will be. We love you so much. Don't you make me cry, Mom. Don't! Adult Annette: We honeymooned in Mexico. It was very romantic. I was so homesick that when we got back, we went right to my parents' house. (squeals, giggles) Jack: Joe. Oh! Oh, Annie, you're pregnant. Oh, Annie! It's a blessing from Saint Anne to get pregnant on your honeymoon. Get your mind out of the gutter there, Virginia. What? They're married. This is what happens to married people. -This fast? -Yeah. Trust me, I know. You're gonna be a father, Jack! (kisses) Break out the cigars. Virginia: Come here, I wanna know everything! Did you buy this in Mexico? And Cinderella and Prince Charming lived happily ever after. At first, it felt that way. But being a wife and mother was the most important thing. I was so happy. Girl: Did it feel like Fairy Tale? No, not really. It didn't? Well, at first it did, but real people have different dreams, and sometimes they don't match. Jack: Annette? -I'm in the kitchen. -(door shuts) Hi, honey, I have a surprise for you. (kisses) And I have a surprise for you. I made your very favorite: Ossobuco. Very gourmet. Very intimate, very just you and me. Annette, I'm so sorry, but we can't. We're meeting Sidney Poitier at La Scala in 45 minutes. (frustrated sigh) Jack! Well, I'm sorry, the whole thing came together at the last moment. I didn't have time to phone. Well, I guess you better just go ahead and go then, and I'll save this for leftovers for tomorrow night. No, you have to come with us. I can't, look at me... Listen, Sidney Poitier is dying to meet you. Now please, this is important. Okay. Okay. I'll even help you dress. As a matter of fact, I'll help you undress. (laughs) (gentle music playing) She's so beautiful! I know! I know! You're looking pretty good yourself there, kiddo. Thanks, Shelley. Thanks for being my friend. Always and forever. I have never seen you look happier. I have never been happier in all my life. You know, it's-it's funny, I-- have always been dependent on-- on Mom and Dad, and... Mr. Disney, and... Jack. And for the very first time in my life, I have someone who's totally dependent on me. (knocking at door) (whimsical music playing) (Annette gasps) -Oh! Ohh... -It's Mickey! Hi, Mickey! Oh, it's for you. (Virginia shushing) (baby cooing) "Now the world has two dolls. Sincerely Yours, Walt Disney." Adult Annette: So Jack and I took our little doll Gina to our new home. We were very happy... for a while. (Gina sneezes) Bless you. (Gina cooing) Okay, Daddy, I put enough milk in the refrigerator for you for the whole night. I put extra. And, um, do you have the numbers where we're gonna be? Don't worry about a thing. -Annette? -Go, go, go. -Come on, we're gonna be late. -Okay, okay. -(kisses) I love you. -She'll be fine. -Come on. -Okay. Okay, Daddy, call us if anything-- -Good night, bye-bye. -Thanks, Joe. -Okay. Bye! -Oh, baby-- Bye-bye! Oh, yeah. Oh... Adult Annette: As a wife and mother, a job I did feel qualified to do was selling peanut butter on television. Man: All right, the set's hot! Leave it alone, folks. Man 2: Turn on the radio, quick! Man (over radio): This just in-- Walt Disney died today. The genius who gave the world the antics of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and their friends, the first full-length animated feature in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, -Did you hear about this, Mom? -...and some of television's most popular programs, today died of lung cancer at St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank, at the age of 65. (sobbing) Adult Annette: He stayed with us until I was grown up enough to bear losing him. (emotional music) (birds chirping) (somber, pensive music) (bells clanging) (clanging gets louder) Adult Annette: 125 stitches later, everything was back in place. (sighs) It's healing better than I ever thought it would. You've done a fantastic job, Doctor. Thank you. Well, it is easy when you're working with great material. Now, what caused it? What was it? It was a fluke. -It wouldn't happen again? -No. It was a once-in-a-lifetime thing. It's just that I've never felt dizziness like that before, and those loud, clanging bells-- -Couldn't it be a warning? -It could, I guess. But, uh, I think it's over. I think it's affected my eyes, though. Yeah? Well, if you're concerned, I can refer you to a specialist, but you look great, Annette. I mean, Why can't you let yourself feel great? Good question. (sighs) Adult Annette: Jack's career was flourishing, and my babies were growing up. They needed me more than ever before. Jack and I were growing far apart. What on earth is wrong with you? I just can't take it anymore, Jack. You can't take what anymore? The-- The openings and the premiers, and all the parties. I just can't stand the show business social life anymore. Do we have to? Oh, I don't know if we have to. -I have to. -Why? You know why, Annette. You know how this business works. Yeah, well, I hate it. You hate it? Well. Well, that may very well be, Annette, but it's what I do. Does that mean you hate me, too? Honey, no, of course not. But? "But" what? It just sounds like there's a "but" in there somewhere. You know what? I don't think you're being very fair. No, you're not being fair. Now, these social obligations, the seeing, the being seen, they're all part of the work. Well, I'm very happy to give them all up. I'm not very happy to give them all up, I can't give them all up. I like it! Well, I don't! And I wish you would spend more time with me and the kids. Why can't you say no to the business more, so that you can spend more time with us? No. What? Annette, I am not about to feel bad for loving my work, and it does not mean that I love my family any less. Annette... when we got married, I wanted us to be together, everywhere, on everything. And we were, weren't we? Yeah, well, now, I go out, you stay in. We never see each other. And we never talk because the only thing I know is the business. And every time I bring it up, you get annoyed, and-- and more and more distant. I'm sorry, but... I can't go on feeling guilty about doing what I love. In name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, may peace be with you. -And also with you. -Amen. Gina: Amen. What is it? Mama... (sighs) I'm so sorry. I just feel like I've let you and Daddy down. I feel like... a failure, and-and like I've sinned. But we're just not happy, and I see how it's affecting the kids, and the pain that it's putting them through, and it's just not fair, I mean... I'm asking Jack for a divorce. I'm sorry, Mama, I'm sorry. Shh, Annie. Annie. I love you very much. And, um... I-I don't believe in divorce, but I believe in you. And you have to do what's right for you and the children. You do. (emotional music) Adult Annette: And after the divorce, my old friends were there to support me. Ah! "Frankie and Annette Return to the Beach, 2." And 3 and 4 and... (laughs) Actually, I always thought that maybe we would do something together that was a little more serious. A little more serious? -Yeah. -(chuckles) Well, overlooking the double-entendre for a second or so, let's just consider what kind of more serious stuff we could have done, okay? -Okay. -All right, let me think now. How about, uh, "Mr. and Mrs. Macbeth Take Malibu." -Good one? -Good one, good one. Okay, another. Uh, how about, "Romeo and Juliet Hang Ten"? -I like that one. -You think they'd buy that one? Or uh... Uh, I can't think of anymore. Nope, the double-entendre's just too powerful. (laughing) You know, Annette, uh, I've had some interesting fantasies about you through the years, -I gotta tell you. -Yeah? Yeah... Well, what ever happened? We just seem to keep missing. How come we never worked out? Well, maybe we did. Maybe it's still to come. You okay? Yeah. Jack and I are still friends. And he's a great dad to the kids. We all still get together for church. It's just, um... lonely mostly. (chuckles) Oh, come on. Annette, please. There'll be somebody else. When? You know, Annette... a new beach picture could really work. I mean, I really know it. Let's see what the writers can come up with, okay? Okay. (somber, pensive music) (engine starts) (discordant notes) -(car honks) -(tires squeal) What is wrong with me?! (sighs) The blind spot is still in your right eye. But it has gotten smaller? Yes. And it could dwindle even more. Or you may have to live with it. Uh, Doctor, about five years ago, she had some dizziness, clanging bells, a very bad fall. Could this be related to that? Possibly a result. It was palsy, but of the optic nerve, which is passing. But what caused it? Could it happen again? What can we do to keep it from happening? I wish I knew, Mrs. Funicello. So whatever it is could just happen again tomorrow? Or never. (scoffs) Oh, great. Always nice to narrow things down. Adult Annette: While the script for Back to the Beach was being written, I decided it was time Gina had her own horse. So we drove out to our old friend Glen Holt's ranch. -It was Glen who got me my first horse. -Well, well, well! Two beautiful women with that certain look in their eyes, both heading my way with a smile. Now, why do I have the feeling I'm about to be trimmed, dressed and cooked? Gina: Mr. Holt, my mother says that-- Just hold on a second there, darling. I've got some greeting to do with your mother. Hello, Annie! Hello, Glen. Oh, you are a sight for sore eyes. Not that my eyes are sore, but-- Oh, it is good to see you, too. I heard about your divorce and... -Yeah. -Sorry. (sighs) Thank you. (awkward laughter) We always were fabulous conversationalists, weren't we? Well, now, little lady. I take it you're Gina, all grown up. Well, yes, I am. And I'd like to buy a horse. Well, all right, good deal. I got some to sell. Come on. I must say, Annie, I'm very happy to see that time has been too busy with the rest of us to have gotten around to you. You are enchanting as ever. (goat bleating) -I got a dozen possibles in there. -Thank you. -Did you dust me off just for the occasion? -Oh, yes I did. I saw the car and I nailed it up. Luckily I keep it in a handy place for just such emergencies. Normally, I have a large picture of Elvis hanging there. Oh, I'll just bet. No such thing. I put that up when you gave it to me. It's never been down. You're family to me, Annie. Mom? Can I see this one, please? Oh, you don't wanna see that horse. (laughs) Well, why not? 'Cause if you see that horse, you're gonna buy that horse. And he's way more than I think you're willing to spend. Well, that's an interesting sales technique. (laughs) Yeah, and it always works, too. (all laughing) -She's gorgeous. -Gina: She is a beauty. Mm. It is so beautiful here. Glen: I know. In all the years I've had this place, I'm still finding new wonders on it. Amazing sights. I'm talking about you. Oh, so now I'm one of the sights? Well, you were always a sight. Now you're an amazing sight. (laughs) You know, they say if you can get a girl to laugh, you can get to her heart. Oh, who says that? -Well, some people I know. -Who? -All right, no one. -Okay. (laughing) -It still could be true. -Yes, it could be. That's good. 'Cause I've gone to some bother. (gasps) I love you, Annie. I've loved you for a long, long time. I'm hoping we can make a home for each other for the rest of our lives. Will you marry me? I love you, too. Adult Annette: Two months later, I got married for the second and last time. Glen: I do love you, honey. You got a cramp? No, my feet are cold. Hmm. Doesn't feel cold. Well, they feel cold to me. Cold, and-- and tingly. What is it, Annie? I don't know. But I-I-I don't feel right. I'm getting those dizzy spells that I can't explain, and my vision is getting worse. And my hands and my feet are numb half the time. Well, we better get back and see that doctor. But it's probably nothing though, right? It's gonna be all right. Don't you worry. I'm here. I love you. I love you. Adult Annette: And somewhere in there, we finally got a beach script Frankie and I liked. Man: And action! Oh, the sun, the sand, the surf! You know, I thought this part of our lives was over when we got married. Well, it doesn't have to be. Yeah, well, we had a pretty good life in Ohio. -Mm-hmm. -(laughs) But... the beach. -The beach is special. -Mm-hmm. Wow. On the beach, you know, I don't even feel married. Man: Hold that... and cut! Man 2: Okay, that's lunch, people! (Annette laughing) All right, let's go find the chow line! -Come on! -Okay. -Oh! -Hey, whoa! You all right? Oh, fine, fine. You sure? Yeah. Standing up too fast, huh? Oh... yeah. I know that's been happening to me a lot lately, too. Must be that old age, huh? -(giggles) -Yeah. (Annette chuckles) Do you remember the last time that we waited like this? Mm-hmm. Mr. Disney came through the door and told us that I was gonna be a Mouseketeer. A Mouseketeer. (tearful laugh) Mama, what if it's a tumor? Annie! Annie... What about the kids, and Glen? I-I can't take care of them, then who's gonna-- Miss Funicello? The doctor will see you now. No, mm-mm. I-I want you to stay. I have to take this alone. (door opens) (emotional music) (crying softly) (sobbing) (machine buzzing) (footsteps approaching) (deep sigh) Annie, what is it? Well, she says that there is no doubt... (tearfully) She said that I have multiple sclerosis. -No! -Yes... No! (emotional music) (both crying) Multiple sclerosis? This is what Jerry Lewis does the telethons for? No. No, honey, that's muscular dystrophy. MS is a disease of the brain and the spinal cord. Basically, when my brain wants to send a message to another part of my body, like my hands or my feet, then... the nerve endings are blocked. Well, how'd you get it? They don't know, honey. But it's not contagious, and it's not hereditary. Well, what do we do to get you over it? (sighs) Well, it's... There is no cure. Oh, that I refuse to accept. But you don't look sick, Mom. I feel fine, mostly, and then all of a sudden, I... I get dizzy and I lose my balance, or I get a fever of 104 degrees, or I can't hold my fork. If there's no cure, does it just get worse and worse until-- No! No, honey. I am not going to die from this. It's just that we don't know how it's going to hit, or... or when. Jack Jr.: Why you, Mom? You've always been so good and tried to do the right thing. It isn't fair. You've taken such good care of yourself. This shouldn't be happening to you. Now, don't you... Don't you count me out, okay? (crying) (sigh) I am gonna manage just fine with your help, okay? I'm gonna be just fine. (tearfully) I plan to be around for a long time and be in the front pew of all your weddings, okay? Now, one thing, very important: this needs to be our secret. Okay? I don't want anyone else to know about this. Grandpa? Uncle Joey? -Uncle Mike? -No, no... (sighs) This is a private thing... because sometimes MS just goes away. And now, I'm not counting on that, I'm not holding out hope, but... but there is a chance, and so that's why I don't want anyone else to know, just yet, okay? Avalon: Now, this is great, listen to this one. Variety says, "Funicello's comedic technique has sharpened, and her ripe beauty is breathtaking." Ta-da! -(Annette giggles) -Wait, my favorite of all. Annette, you've got to hear this one. This one says, "The reunion of Annette and Frankie "is a monster success. When can we expect the next?" -Mm. -What do you think, huh? There's more, there's lots more, and they all say the same thing. Annette, you and I have outfoxed old Father Time. We just get better and better. Now, let me ask you... I can have us a new script in about six weeks. -Is that good for you? -Oh, Frankie. Don't count on me for the next one. Oh, funny, very funny. No, listen to me, I-I can't do it. I can't do another one. -You're kidding. -I'm not. I think that it's great that we made such a strong comeback, and I just wanna quit while we're at the top. At the top? We haven't reached the top. The next one will be even bigger. I know, I hate to let you down, Frankie. Well, then, don't. Annette... is there something I don't know? I... just changed my mind about going ahead with the films. (deep exhale) Hmm. Oh, a lot of people are going to be disappointed. Me the most. You'll change your mind. I won't. I just think this is best for everybody. (sighs) Hm. I'll keep in touch. I'm sorry, Frankie. -Me, too. -(door opens) (door closes) (groans) I hate lying to Frankie like that. (sighs) It's hard with your father, too. I... I just feel like I can't let anyone know yet. -I can't explain it. -It's all right. Annie... I just feel like I would be letting them down. We're trying it your way. It's okay, we'll see. (sighs) Was this one of those bad days? Mm. Oh, Annie, all those years ago, that fortune teller we saw in Utica. This must have been what she saw and couldn't tell us. Mom... no fortune teller could ever have predicted how wonderful my life would be. And still is. I'm gonna be fine, I am gonna walk down that aisle at Gina's wedding, and I'm gonna sit in the front pew. -(deep exhale) -Come here. Mm. (metal clattering) I'm stuck. (patrons chattering) Man: Johnny, want to help these people here? (chatter continues) -Hi. -Hi. Well, I beat you. -I know. -I can't believe it. (laughs) I know, I just can't seem to get my timing right on anything anymore. The city has changed so much. I-I hardly get out anymore. Tell me about it. Remember, I'm the one who keeps calling. So, how is everyone? -All good. -Ah. You know Gina's getting married. -Yes. -How about your gang? The same. And you? -Fabulous. -Good. Because that is exactly how you look. -Oh... -It's true. How is work? It's fine. Can I ask about the cane now? Oh, that's-- it's nothing. It's just tendonitis. No, it's not. Well, it's something like that. I was a dancer. Oh. Of course, I-I, I mean, I should have known. It's so automatic. Dancer equals cane use. Fred Astaire. Well, no. Cyd Charisse. Uh... no. Leslie Caron? No. Shall I go on? No. Annette. We have been friends forever. What's wrong? I can't. Um, it's just, it's really... -It's nothing. -Please. Help me with this. You've been avoiding me. I practically have to threaten you to get you out of the house, and now you have a cane. People... people think you're drinking. (scoffs) That's ridiculous. I'm telling you, it's in all the tabloids. And with every agent at the Polo Lounge. Is that what you think? No, of course not. But... honestly, I, um... I don't know what to think anymore. I'm sorry. Shelley, I am so sorry. What is it? There-- I-- I am going through something. But I just, I can't tell you just now. Okay. How can I help? Oh, you already have. Thank you for being my friend. Always and forever, kiddo. Adult Annette: Frankie wouldn't give up. He and Dick Clark had organized a Back to the Beach tour, and wanted me along. Give me one good reason why you can't go. Well, you know being a mother always comes first with me. Your youngest is 16, he drives. I mean, you really don't have to carpool anymore. I-I hate to travel, I... I'm scared to death to sing live. Annette, don't put it off, do it now, while you and Frankie are at your best. I say this as a friend, not a promoter. Annette... We really ought to do this. I mean, who knows if we'll ever get another chance. (sighs) Okay, I'll do it. But we play mostly on the weekends. And it's booked so that I can come home after every few dates? You got it. Okay. -Okay! -Okay! ♪ Jamaica Ska ♪ ♪ Now everybody Can do the Ska ♪ ♪ It's the new dance That goes like this ♪ ♪ Now bow you head ♪ ♪ And swing your arms ♪ ♪ Shake your hips ♪ ♪ Now do a dip ♪ ♪ Ska Ska Ska ♪ ♪ Jamaica Ska ♪ ♪ Ska Ska Ska ♪ ♪ Do the Ska ♪ Now what do you think, huh? Hot or what? I think it's gonna be very good. I think it's gonna be... great. (panting) I can't-- Avalon: Here, let me get some glasses. We'll have a toast, okay? I can't do this, Mama. I can't keep pretending like this. I'm sick. I'm very sick. I have multiple sclerosis. You knew? I knew. You know somethin', dolly? I've been so very proud of you, since the moment you were born. And you've been a joy to me for all your life. But you can be a pretty stubborn kid sometimes. I didn't want to worry you, Daddy. And you didn't want to disappoint your fans by letting them find out that your life has a cloud over it. Am I right? Something like that. No more secrets, honey. I promise. Maybe you can actually help out others who have this disease. Bring it out into the open. I don't know, I'm not ready yet. I-I'm not ready for everybody to know about it. Frankie, did you know, too? Annette, I knew. I... I was so worried, I went to Glen and... Look, I told because I couldn't be up here on stage with you. I wanted someone to take care of you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (sobs) I'm sorry. I've been the one who's living the lie. Oh, gosh, I've got to tell Shelley. Virginia: Shelley knows, honey. I told her. I had to tell her, Annette! She was so worried about you. (sighs) It's gonna come out, Annette. You're gonna have to talk about it. You know the tabloids smell a story. It would be much better if it comes from you. If you were the one who told the world. You're right. You're right. (deep sigh) No more pretending. (upbeat music) Adult Annette: Daddy was right about helping people. I received countless letters from people who were able to come to terms with their MS because of my coming out in the open. And the outpouring of love and support was just overwhelming. Well... let's see what the postman brought us today. You always get an amazing amount of mail. Isn't that nice? Yes, it is. Cinderella has a happy ending! My story doesn't have an ending... yet. I think only fairy tale people know the ending. Come on, kids. Time to go. Okay. -Let's go, come on. -All right. (overlapping chatter) Bye, Annette. Thank you for telling us a story. You're welcome. Bye! Bye. Girl: Bye-bye! Okay, Mom, are you ready to go? I really wanted to walk down the aisle today. But, I promised I'd be in the pew. I didn't say how I'd get there. It makes me so happy when I hear from people that my going public makes them feel stronger. They're not embarrassed to use their canes or to be in a wheelchair, because if I can do it, they feel they can, too. -(wedding march playing) -(whispering) ♪♪ Like Cinderella, I believe a dream is a wish your heart makes. I've had a dream life, and I look forward to each new day with a smile. Priest: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today in the sight of God and the face of this congregation, to join together this man and this woman...
