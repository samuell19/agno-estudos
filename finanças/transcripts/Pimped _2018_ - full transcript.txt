- It doesn't make any sense at all. You think it's a lot of money so your mind's telling you oh, don't spend any more, it's just for kicks. This pissweak little voice inside your head is telling you to accept lesser quality. Like even though you're willing to spend your hard earned cash on what is already an expensive purchase, this little voice is telling you to accept poor quality on your investment. But any way you look at it that's third world economics. Invest more, I say, go for gold. Compared to your initial purchase, percentage wise, it's low. And your friends are going to be happier. It's a gift. And now you're happy. - Thank you. - I've got some people you need to meet. - Your house is huge! - You like it? - I like it a lot. - I love my house. - This is yours? - This is my house. After you. I'm ready. It's awfully quiet. - Sounds like bliss. - Domestic bliss? - Relax. - Well I would. But I see things that need to be done. Can't help wanting to be the one to do them now, can I? - You're a saint. - I am what I am. - I'm not listening. - Yet you still hear me. - The Charlington Estate is huge. It's like a maze. You literally have to get there by boat. They have their own wharf. We hunt them in pairs. We give them a 90-second head start and then we head off. Most guys, they run. Sweating, creaming their pants, but no, no, no, no, not us. See they only hide from the ugly ones. You know they, have their own nine-hole golf course? - I'd kill for my own golf course. Be my guest. Wouldn't be the first time. - Bit much, don't you think? - I agree. - Sweet! - You're good, you're very good. The floor's warped. - Oh yeah, yeah, there's a lot of width in here. Man, I am getting sick of winnings! - I don't feel well. - Shy will get you nowhere. You're beautiful. - To your god-awful rich parents and their snooty little country club. - To mummy! Now, to the winner go the spoils. Pour it yourself, Richie Rich. - You have to be such a cunt? - Takes one to know one. - Indeed it does. - Hi. I'm Lewis Henry Robinson , at your service. I'm Lewis, Lewis Henry Robinson. I'm Lewis Henry Robinson. Hi, I'm Lewis Henry Robinson. At your service. I'm Lewis Henry Robinson at your service. A whisky neat, thank you. I used to sneak into a joint like this when I was 15. With my brother's ID. And now, here we are stuck in this miniature time warp, just 15 years too late for the party. To time travel, and for those who aren't afraid to get a little dizzy. - Warp speed. Technically speaking, warp speed isn't time travel. - Is that so? - Well, you know, it's more like hyper drive. You see, matter doesn't just disappear and reappear someplace else. You just get to where you're going a hell of a lot faster. - And where's that? - Well if I knew that it wouldn't be near as much fun. Sorry. I'm such an idiot. - If you could time travel, where would you? - Back. - Reason? - Fix my fuck ups. You? - Fast forward. - But that'd be cheating. - Do you really need to be in here? - He's handsome. - I should go home. - No way, I'm not let letting you run away. He's perfect. - I'm not you. - He likes you. - I don't wanna do this anymore. Okay then, let's leave. And then what? Sit around at home, trying not to think about him? Others? - I could do that. - You're back. I thought you might have fast forwarded to somewhere better. - Evidently not. - Lewis Henry Robinson. At your service. But you probably already knew that. - Nice to meet you again, Lewis Henry Robinson. - You're forever pushing me away. See-saw, she saw. Buckle up, kiddos. - The key to survival is the end of this sad, deluded idea that we actually possess a soul. - And here I was thinking it was food and shelter. - Well no, the end of fatalism religion, magic, rebirth, all of these delusions that have crept into our psyches without our even being aware of them, gone. All those smart enough to accept everything that's unchangeable, life, death, randomness, they're going to be the winners. Or it could be nothing, nothing at all. - My money's on nothing. - So you're a gambler? - Oh, everyone gambles. Most people just aren't awake enough to realize that's what they're doing. So, in this unique brand of anarchy you subscribe to what's off limits? - Hey! That is no way to treat a host. Come back! You are fun! Come back! - Oi. - Kenny, where's the party at? Kenny? Kenneth? Bloody hell. I can explain. Kenneth is a monster. Can we talk this through? Sarah Rachel Montrose. 34 Clauson Parade, Lillyvale. You came a hell of a long way to get laid. - You come any closer and I'll slice your balls off. I'll do it, fucker. - Yes, you're quite capable. - Give me my bag. - Come on Sarah, let's just talk about this-- - Now! - Come and get it. - You can't leave without it. - Just give me bag and then I'm leaving. I should call the cops. - Oh, you wanna call the cops? Call the cops. He raped me. You raped me. You set me up to be raped by your friend. - Rape is such an ugly word. - There's a reason for that. - Yeah well, you just got more than you bargained for, didn't you? It's hardly an excuse to kill a man. And let's say you did go to the police, I'm positive there would be CCTV footage of you and me leaving the club together. And if pushed, I would have to tell the police the truth, that you were simply a horny pick-up who wanted to party. Officer, it was just me and my friend. We were just having a good time and she fuckin' killed him, she killed him with a fucking golf club. Jesus! Maybe I should call the police. - What if you couldn't call the police? - That's interesting. But there's no guarantee. It would just get messy, and it's already pretty messy, wouldn't you say? - He's right. - Listen, neither of us wants this to follow us around for the rest of our lives, do we? We need to work together on this. We bury the body someplace far away. We do it together and we are bound to eternal secrecy because of our complicity. - And then what? - If anyone asks, we'll just say Kenneth wasn't in when we got back from the club. He'll just become another missing persons stat. Sarah. - I keep the knife. - Good girl. - Better yet, I'll give you a shovel. We need time to work this out. Just keep your distance. - I killed him. - You were amazing. We're good together. - He knows where we fucking live. - You were saying? - You look like you've done this before. - I won't stop you. - Oh, you couldn't. - Did you get bullied at school? - Don't try and justify what you did. - Don't cut yourself. Okay. Ready, Kenny? Oh, shit. Just going to wash up. He's not going to jump in by himself. I get it, I really do, but I'm not interested in having two dead bodies to dispose of. - Neither am I. - Then grab a leg. One, two, three! Why didn't you call the police? It's too late now, but you could have. - He thinks you're hiding something. - That fucked up vanishing trick, you played that before? - Not with the same result. - He ever line one up for you? - I don't need help. So that's your thing, you bait women into being fucked by your friend. How charitable? - I lost at golf. - What? - I let Kenny win, of course, makes him feel better about himself, his pathetic life. And he doesn't charge me rent. - You lose a game on purpose. You bring home somebody to rape. You think you're special. - What'd it feel like to kill him? - It felt like someone else. - What about when Kenny entered you, did that feel like someone else too? - You're a piece of shit. - Oh, you get what you deserve in this life. - More two-bit philosophy. - Think of it like reverse karma. Whatever happens to you is kind of zen, you know? Kenneth, he deserved to die. - Told you. - And I deserved to be raped? - I don't believe any victim has a right to complain. You either get what you deserve or you learn a valuable life lesson. - So where does that leave you? - Me, I'm merely the provider, a fixer. - And what's the valuable life lesson I'm meant to have learnt from all this? - Well, you're really the only one who knows the answer to that. - Hmm, well, how convenient for you? - But if I was to hazard a guess, perhaps it would be something about understanding your power. - She's got one hell of a swing. - Your power over men. See, males are inherently weak, well, most males. That's why some men insist women cover their faces, their bodies. You know, it lessens the female power. But you walk into a bar dressed like you are tonight and you have incredible power. You're a beautiful woman. - If you're looking for a sympathy fuck, you're talking to the wrong girl. - The value of things is random. Take my car for example. I buy it for X amount of dollars and it seems like a lot but one could argue that now it makes for a pretty cheap hearse. But there's an exception to the rule. There is one thing in this life whose value is not random but biologically predetermined and in fact vital for our continuation as a species. - Her pussy. - Your pussy. Maybe this has all been about you acknowledging how your pussy has affected your life. And you know, it'll take time for you to understand. Your mind's been programmed since childhood. You imagine things that aren't real. - Fuck you, Lewis. - Things that you think you want and then something like this, random happens. And it changes everything. - There's nothing random about what you did. - Well, could have been anyone sitting on that bar stool. - As fucked up as he is, you've got to admit he's hot. - He's sick. - Exactly. - Yeah, you're not helping. - Okay. I'm just not sure what I'm supposed to do here. Sneak up behind him? - You're full of shit ideas, just like him. - Straight to the grave. No drags marks, hmm? Three, two, one! - My knickers, if you don't mind. - I'm sorry. - I need you to say you're sorry. - It wouldn't change a thing. - I need you to say you're sorry for what you did to me. - It would be a hollow statement. It's important, for me. In words, written. I know you don't understand but I need to be able to look at that one day and-- - What's it worth? - This is no longer a game, Lewis. - How about a drink? This is a lot harder than I thought it would be. - Happy now? - You have no idea what you've done, do you? - What I've done? What I've done. What about what you've done? You have a short term memory, don't you? - I presume you're Lewis. - Correct. - Oh, thank goodness. I thought we were going to be stuck out here all night. - The flight from hell. We're Kenneth's parents. - Oh. - Do you mind? - Of course. Please, come in. - Thank you. - I'm Michael. - Great. - Grab the other bag, would you Louie? - He's not here. Where's my boy? - We were hoping you could tell us. - This is Sarah, my girlfriend. - Sarah, this is Kenny, Kenneth's folks, Michael and-- - You're wearing Kenneth's clothes. - It's nice to meet you. - Big night? - We um, actually, we just got home. - And Kenneth? - Well mean, he wasn't here when we got back. - I spoke to him from Dubai. - And he knew you were getting in this late? - Yes. - He never mentioned it. He loves his surprises, does Kenny. - Would have been a surprise if he had shown up. - Oh well if it wasn't for that rubbish airline you booked I'd be home relaxing already. - And where is home? - Sanctuary Heights. - Great golf course. - I don't understand. I've called him a dozen times and he doesn't call back. - I have exactly the same problem with Kenny. He never answers his phone. Look, I'm sure he's fine. Probably just holed up with friends. He'll be here any minute. - I need a hot shower. - Of course. - Oh yes, go and look after your back. - You, ah, obviously know where everything is. - I ought to, I built it. - Oh, very beautiful. - As much as Kenneth likes to think it's his. - Cup of tea? - Well. - Still feeling bad about Kenneth? - Not so much. - Kenneth never really told me much about you. He did say he's enjoying the extra company. - Oh, that makes two of us. - So, how did you meet? - Funny thing, we actually met right there in the lounge room. Through a mutual friend. - He is a social creature. - Yes he is. - Who's a creature? - Ah, Kenny. I was just telling Mrs Hanson-- - Oh, Sophia. - Oh, I was just telling Sophia how Kenny and I met. - Hmm, well maybe if Sophia would like to hear how I met Kenny too. - You think? - Oh, this is not like him, not to be here when we arrive. Why are you sorry, Lewis? - That's um. - Darn, it's part of this silly housekeeping system the boys came up with. - Yeah. - Whenever one of them leaves a dirty plate laying around the house or a takeaway container, or whatever, the other person has to write a sorry note. - The first person to write five gives the other person 50 dollars. - Oh , well someone's making a fortune. - I'm afraid it's not me. - Persistence is the key to good housekeeping, Lewis. - Very true. - Very true. - That, and good appliances. You know, we bought Kenneth the best vacuum cleaner money could buy. Perhaps we should have got him a maid. - Kenny would love a maid. - If you fuck this up, then we are both done for. - So boy genius, come morning and Kenneth still isn't here, what then? - He knew they were coming tonight and never said a word. - He's laughing his arse off now. - Little cunt. It's in the genes. - What the fuck? Do you have any idea what this is doing in the boot of my car? - Your car? - Yes. - Oh those? They're um. - They're props. - Yeah. - Kenneth offered to drive me to rehearsal tomorrow. - Sarah's a performer. - Actress. Just amateur stuff you know, local theater group. Kenny said to put them in the boot. - Props? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, we're doing The Firewalkers. - Oh, it's great. - The El Boging Secundo laundered his bloody underpants and handkerchief stiff and crackly with black sputum. - This is crap! Where is Kenneth? What the fuck are you talking about? - Sophia, what she's talking about is a pair of bloody underpants. Why don't you try them on? - What? - Well, it might bring back fond memories of you being young enough to menstruate. - You little prick! Oh. - Sophie? Sophia! Sophie. Where are you darling? Sophie! Oh my God! - Maybe we should just leave. Leave everything. - I see things that need to be done. - Thank you. - To getting a little dizzy. - Kenny have any brothers or sisters likely to pop in? - Only child. - Hmm, clean sweep. - Thanks to you. - I can feel everything. - You're more like me than you know. - Maybe I am. Maybe we're all a bit like you. - No, no wait, wait! No, no, no, no, no! - What the fuck? Sarah! Fuck! Sarah. Sarah. No, no, no. Sarah, you do not! You do not have to do this. Sarah, please, please. You do not, you do not have to do this. - Don't talk. - Hi, we're in this together. Remember? - Look, it's okay that you don't give a shit about me, or anyone else. It actually makes this easier. - No. We were wrong. I, I see that now. - Words Lewis, they're just words. - Yes, yes, yes. It's a bad habit of mine but please, I just have a lot on my mind right now. Is that really what you want your last words to be? - Fuck you! You think you can walk away from this? I'm, I'm truly sorry. Sarah I'm, I'm truly sorry. - You don't want to do this. Why? - Because I hurt you. - Let's just leave. - You keep trying to ruin my life. - Is that all I'm doing? - That's what it feels like. - You're fucking crazy. You're fucking insane. Sarah, Sarah, please listen to me. I can access Kenneth's bank account. I can access his account. I can access his account. Okay? Sarah, please. Please, please, please. - Mummy, look! - Hey rabbit! Oh, it's magnificent. - An owl gave it to me. - Did he? Come here. Hey you. - I found it in the garden. - Oh, did you? - Oh, my God! - Oh, is it tickly? - Yeah! - How'd you go? - Yeah, great. We had a really good weekend, didn't we? - Good. - We played all weekend, and we collected the eggs. - Did you collect eggs? Were you good for Dadda? - Yes. - The sounds of birds chirping made them smile. Deer walked off with Tiger by her side. They didn't say anything. The setting sun warmed their faces. The wind rustled their fur. It was time for quiet. And anyway, they knew what the other was thinking. - The end!
