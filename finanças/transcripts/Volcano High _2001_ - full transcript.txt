The school community was falling into endless chaos. Also, the Legend of the chosen one who will acquire the 'Secret Manuscript' and end the turbulent times, makes ail the students volatile. It was Year of the Volcano 108 Volcano High KIM Kyung-soo, this is the Last chance. This coming era for us will go down in history. I, the Dark Ox, JANG Ryang, appoint this man of standing as the deputy Leader of the Dark Ox faction. Concho! The future of our faction is in your hands now. There will be no triumph without painful Lessons and broken bones. Dark Ox - JANG Ryang Captain of the weightlifting team Did you see me? Hey! Are you OK? Of course not. I have to hurry to the sick bay. Was it me? Is there anybody else? Hand... handkerchief! The flower of Volcano High Icy Jade - YOO Chae-yi Captain of the Kendo team A mixed school! JANG Ryang! How dare you desire the Secret Manuscript. Elegant Crane in Pine Forest - SONG Hak-rim Volcano High's No.1 Man His chi power is in phase 10 Who are you? Nice to meet you. I've just transferred here. KIM Kyung-soo. Can you tell me where the staff room is? Over there? What is wrong with you? Where did you get that chi power? Reveal your identity! You, SONG Hak-rim, the great fighter, got hurt by a sudden gust of wind? It must be as strong a gust as Concho had - he was sucked out by it while cleaning the window. Are you badly hurt? Well, it is good for me. How Long has it been since I had to treat a patient with iodine? He had an extremely high chi level. What did you say? It's freshly brewed tea. - Please share it with the principal. - Oh, really? The principal must be a fortune-teller. Sorry? When I played Paduk with him yesterday, he said a hurricane would come today because he had pain in his shoulder. And? What else? I had to massage his shoulder for two hours. Is it good quality? Breaking school property, violence towards the principal... and assaulting a female teacher? Our school is your ninth transfer. Do you know what I am called here? The adder - the one that catches something and never lets it go. I have cold blood and deadly poison! You'd better hurry up and find your tenth school now if you are not committed to behaving yourself in this school. I'm not going to give you the chance to make any mistakes. Do you hear me, KIM Kyung-soo? I'II do my best. Everyone says that in the beginning. For your class... Let me see which one would suit you. What? Hot! Please do not sleep in front of the students. Yes. Bring your jacket to my desk. I'II clean it for you. No...it's ail right. Never mind. OK, then. You look like a good boy. Introduce yourself. Kim! Kyung! Soo! I think he's too shy to introduce himself! By the way, is Concho playing truant again? What a different world it's become! When I was your age, I never dreamt of playing truant. Oops, it's that time already. I'II tell you the rest of the story next time. You can take that empty seat next to Concho's. Was it too much for your first Lesson? You, the transferred guy. I'm impressed by your restraint. I didn't get angry because it was just a childish joke. So you thought it was only a joke. Do you want to study the art of restraint with Dark Ox, JANG Ryang? Are you JANG Ryang? You are really very kind! By the way, what does Dark Ox mean? Self-restraint! Practise restraint three times and you'll avoid committing murder! Restraint-restraint! You seem quite good but no one who challenges me ever walks away alive. Stand up! My joke is not finished yet. It's your Lucky day, transferred guy. You're right. It's too much of a holy day to see blood. I don't know where you've come from. But don't ever relax at Volcano High. The Headhunting Master, Shimma Captain of rugby team My grandma brought it for me yesterday from the countryside. Exchange Student Soy...bean...paste! I am sorry, Dal-chun! His real name is...JANG Dal-chun! JANG Ryang, the canteen is not the place to fight. And soybean paste is the best thing when you've lost your appetite. She writes hundreds of Love Letters that she never sends to him. Devoted heart, SOH Yo-sun, vice captain of the Kendo team. Today is your Last day. The man who can beat drought, thunder and Lightning... I can't lose the Secret Manuscript now. I'm almost there. SONG Hak-rim is only a puppy when it comes to the Secret Manuscript. The principal is a blind Buddha without the Manuscript. SONG Hak-rim, I will end your arrogant showing off today. Hoh! It's a really good tactic. It's as if you're reading my mind. You think so? I think you read me better. You are the one, Principal, the one who can attain Nirvana. You will be able to read whatever you want after mastering the Secret Manuscript. Again! You're talking of the Manuscript? Who spread such a rumour? Instead... I'II show you the new martial art I am practising these days. The Principal, JANG Oh-ja He survived the Massacre of the Scholars and chose exile. He gained insightful wisdom from a cock's cawing at dawn. He renamed himself and returned to the education system as a liberal. The Vice Principal, JANG Hak-sa He was a teacher when the Massacre broke out and was shocked by a young student who slapped him. He renamed himself and devoted himself to authoritarian education. What are you doing? Look out for your stones. I am defeated again today. It's good enough if we can just avoid a rainstorm. I know you just Live in a kennel. Of course, it is not easy to find the right shelter. So...do you Like Living in the kennel? It is difficult...so difficult! Do Not Enter It was 7 am. He was first found by a nurse who visited the house when the holy circle by the bamboo forest had gone. He found the principal stuck in a trance and a deadly poisonous herb. Once poisoned, the body shows red rashes and gets stuck in a trance when he connects with his chi energy. Use simple Language! Yes, sir! Therefore, in the nurse's opinion, the suspect must be greatly interested in the Secret Manuscript. The prime suspect is SONG Hak-rim, the second is the vice principal... Who wrote this? - The nurse. - Suspect! Please speak Louder! What? He spells out 'suspect'. He tries to indicate who did this. S...sss. Look, he sounds 's' for 'suspect'. I could be 's' for 'save me'. I think you're poisoned a Littlie bit too. You should never practise your chi power. Go and bring me the Secret Manuscript! The principal's Training Room will be closed from now on. You should relay my words to everyone. I will draw a new holy circle to protect the Secret Manuscript on behalf of the principal. What are you doing? Go and arrest SONG Hak-rim! Yes, that's true. 'S' for 'SONG Hak-rim'! Convicted for poisoning and attempted murder. I welcome you here. Mr Principal! Here it is. I gave you wings but you are getting stuck in a coop. Where did he hide it... Where! You...stupid old bugger! Where did you hide it? Whoa! This is a conspiracy! Somebody conspired against him. This is clearly a conspiracy. Stop it. Everyone knows it is a conspiracy. JANG...Dal...chun! I told you I am JANG Ryang! It's not always helpful to have too many people behind you, Shimma. Outbreak of War! The weightlifting team attacks the rugby and football teams! I welcome you, JANG Ryang. You come here. I welcome any challenges from you, dogs and cows. I, JANG Ryang, give you two days. If there is anyone who is willing to challenge me, come forward within two days. Long time no see, Chae-yi. Wait for two days. Why should we? Not so confident now? No. Now is not the time. Compared to how Long I have had to wait, two days is nothing. The only way we can survive is - uniting with the rugby team... - Why rugby? - You were also defeated. - Want to see who's better? Stop, everyone. I didn't call the meeting for us to fight. I took it too easy on JANG Ryang, I won't let him get away next time. Everybody, just follow my command! No one here could beat JANG Ryang alone. We ail have to unite our power. Let's rescue SONG Hak-rim first then he can beat JANG Ryang! JANG Ryang should be easier to beat than SONG Hak-rim. What do you mean? SONG Hak-rim had to be knocked out of the No.1 place anyway. Now it is easier because we only have JANG Ryang to beat. True. The Secret Manuscript is only given to the No.1 . But we shouldn't Let it go to a jerk Like JANG Ryang! Now, the Secret Manuscript is mine! Such insanity! I will beat JANG Ryang! Impudence! Never underestimate the Judo team. OK, Let's sort it out. Come on! The talks break down What's going on? SONG Hak-rim is gone and now the students are more volatile. What are you worrying about? The students needed a new Leader Like me. They didn't even make a single noise when SONG Hak-rim was here. Isn't it strange? Don't worry about the students. As soon as I get the Secret Manuscript, things will be fine. Wait a Littlie while more until it Looks OK to hand it over to you. I expect it to be as soon as possible. Detestable creature! He will soon ask for the principal's seat. What are you Looking at? You horrible old bugger! Thunder and Lightning stance? It's only a Legend. It's impossible for a human being to achieve it. If a person was born with the capacity to do it, it's not impossible. In any case, The Secret Manuscript is not for a jerk Like JANG Ryang. The real problem is KIM Kyung-soo. It will get worse when he tries to win the Manuscript. What are you talking about? I didn't come here to talk about the Manuscript. In the end, he will try to get it. I should stop him. This is silly. I am talking about the school. Hey...what's wrong? Listen up, YOO Chae-yi, no one can take the Manuscript away from me. You haven't brought peace to the school, you've only managed to stop the fighting. Come back as soon as possible. There are many fighters who want to beat you in the school. Impossible! Did you really throw water on Chae-yi? Not really, it was only a mistake. Even Lincoln was only a farmer before he was president! Don't even dream of having her. I only tell you this because you sit next to me. If you mess with her, you won't be able to walk straight again. When Shimma tried to give her a box of chocolates on Valentine's Day Last year, he had to take a week off from school because he got a stick shoved up his arse. Hey, why do you think she is called 'Icy Jade'? She is as cold as ice. So cold! Hey! My dear friend, Kyung-soo! Speak of the devil, and he is sure to appear. We have an unresolved problem. - Not that I know of. - Yes, we have! When you and I work together, the rugby team will regain their strength! I wasn't ready! Let's do it again! That was really cool. You are great. Beating up a student? Your school record doesn't afford you to have another accident. Here is the application form to join the Kendo team which means that we help each other get through tough student Life. I can't sign up for an violent squad. We are only a Littlie tough... and we are not that violent. Wait... Wait a second! First, accept my apologies. Our joke went too far. Have you ever heard about the frog that was killed by a stone? It was too much. Saving SONG Hak-rim is not a joke. We should have told him... So you really think SONG Hak-rim in jail is a joke. I don't think SONG Hak-rim brings justice. So you think JANG Ryang brings justice? So whatever JANG Ryang does is fine? Those kind of jerks are everywhere. Ignoring them is the best treatment. What? You don't even think of fighting back? Ignore him? You are a coward. Yes, you are right. I am a coward. Let him go. We chose the wrong person. Two days have passed, Chae-yi. I, JANG Ryang, have never knelt down to anyone before. But Chae-yi... I want to tell you what's in my heart as I get down on my knees. From the first moment I saw you, my heart has always followed you. But I had to wait to be the master, to be the chosen one to Lead Volcano High. Icy Jade! YOO Chae-yi! Please accept my heart. This is to mark our Love. Please give me your hand... JANG Ryang, are you sick today? Nobody can stop my Love for Chae-yi. Chae-yi! I will fit the ring on your finger. Don't move. This is my business. Stay back. Understood? Your man should be the No.1 in Volcano High. That is me. What is this? I have a question that I am really curious to ask. Is it true the No.1 of the school gets the girl he wants? A real man knows how to give up if she doesn't want him. Begging and forcing are not what a real man does for Love. How dare a Littlie dork Like you believe you can stop me on a day Like this. If you don't take my heartfelt advice, it means you don't deserve it. You! You are already dead! - Kyung-soo, brother! - Please, no! You started it! AII right. I will accept it. - You are the No.1 . - What are you doing? No one will doubt you from now on. We've seen your ability. Release him. Show us your generosity as the No.1 . Thank you, Chae-yi. Being accepted by you is ail I ever dreamt of. Yes. I will come back to you as the best of the best as soon as I find the Secret Manuscript. Don't make a big fuss. Chae-yi. That's my cream for athlete's foot. So you think I'II fail without the Secret Manuscript? I'II get rid of everyone. Everyone! Watch out, you old bugger! I welcome you ail! You, the Five Great Cleaners! Volcano High The School Five - The Masters of Suppressing Disobedient Students My name, Ma Bang-jin, which means the composition of secretive numbers. You're only meant to read textbooks in class. It's strange. I can't feel any chi of the Manuscript. It must have been taken away. He's really a mean old bugger. It must've been buried somewhere. - It is exactly what I thought. - What do you mean? If you tell a tiger who's never seen a mouse in his Life that a mouse is scary, the tiger might not able to sleep in comfort being afraid of a mouse. Of course, such rumours... always spring from the scared mice. So you mean it was only an empty case? Then...what happened? Don't Lose your temper. The Secret Manuscript does exist. What are you saying now? Mr Ma! Are you kidding me? That's strange. I thought it was only the vice principal who's allowed to enter the Training Room. Perhaps the new teachers are chasing the Manuscript too. Don't be stupid! Anyway, the vice principal is on my side. Do you still keep writing Letters... ..to the jail? Say hello to SONG Hak-rim from me. - Gather ail the members. - Huh? If you have a question, ask it in class! What kind of behaviour is this? If I ask a question in school, do you ever answer me? Look at your hair style! - Don't go! - Get off me! This is my business. Stay away from me. I am deeply touched by your friendship. Long time no see, KIM Kyung-soo. Should I thank you? Yes. It's you who saved me from being expelled from school. Is this OK with you? I'm sorry about what happened to Yo-sun. No, we should be sorry for ourselves. We were cowards. I was afraid. I couldn't move, even a bit. But if I were as powerful as you are, I wouldn't have been Like that. It's Hard to be Strong - The Story of his Cruel Youth I really didn't want to fight. But the kids never Left me alone. Please, Kyung-soo. Get yourself transferred to the other school! I wish it had never happened to me... ..that accident! Hey! Welcome! - Again? - Do I transfer schools again? It's OK. Let's pack. You, young lad! You don't catch fish, you're only making a mess. The fish became a dragon that ascended to the sky Long ago. Is it going to be OK? Don't worry. He's not going to kill him. I'II get straight to the point. If I were at school, I would have blocked your chi vessels. Don't worry. You don't have to worry about me any more. Have you finished? I'm Leaving. KIM Kyung-soo! The blocked chi vessels will make you feel more pain. If it is my fate, I will bear it. Let's see how much you can bear. Leave me alone. Then defeat me. Strength means the ability to absorb other chi and integrate it into your own. Wisdom is having the insight to combine my chi with others' chi. Get off me! Righteousness is gained by overcoming the differences between you and me and abandoning the ego. Although I unblocked your chi vessels, it doesn't mean your chi is back. From now on, it is totally up to you. Don't get me involved in your power game. KIM Kyung-soo... don't run away from your fate. However hard you try to run, your fate won't Let you go. Now you are the No.1 . Are we students or cleaners? Why are we asked to clean the school ail the time? I'm sorry. I really don't want to be involved. Now they are five. Later, it will be ten. There is no point in fighting with them. You don't have to worry. You're safe as Long as you run away from them. Men Women YOO Chae-yi, what are you doing? Oh, my God! Let yourself flow Like water, as Lightning can only merge with water. Men KIM Kyung-soo, you've got your best friend here. There is harmony of Yin and Yang in water. When the harmony breaks down, Lightning is born. Therefore, water and Lightning are one. Ah, I am...thirsty. I want to make this room into a staff room. I don't Like it. The room is full of the stench of men - if these kids can be called men. Stand up! What a pigsty! What is this stench? It's as if somebody has urinated here. Stop it! This place is not for you teachers to come to. According to the vice principal, ail team activities are banned from now on. The vice principal? Then I am sure there is some confusion. He can't do this to me, JANG Ryang! I don't care who you are. School is not the place for you kids to play around in. I think it's too harsh to ban the team activities. Is it true you're getting rid of the weightlifting team? What happened? I'm sorry. Of course, it's not true. Did you know the new teachers are too interfering? I kept quiet because I thought it was your desire to Let them be. But not any more. How the hell do you do your job properly and Let this Littlie git burst into my office? You see! An incapable teacher such as you allows this sort of thing happen! Do you understand? Please, vice principal! Do you even recognise me, JANG Ryang? I know. I know your name. But if you have any difficulties in school, go and see the student dean, not me. Ah! From now on, Mr Ma, you are the student dean. And this kid? Please take good care of him. The student Dal-chun is a Littlie dull but physically strong. Now get out. Attention! I ask for your patience in this hard time. I, JANG Ryang, I've tolerated this with a calm and peaceful mind. But I'II discard my generosity for a moment and show my power. I proudly present my new martial art skill 'Great Weight Iron' that I've been practising. JANG Ryang, it's time for me to go home. Very nice! Don't you agree? I tried to give you a chance but not anymore! That's it... I am JANG Ryang. JANG Ryang! I feel really good. So you mean your chi power can empty the students' heads? Can it really happen? That's why this 'Air and Light Wave' is terrifying. The kid goes mad in a second then becomes Like a puppet. In one second! Very clean! Good! Good! Experiment with it as soon as possible! I prepared this exciting class to help develop your personality. Whoever finds their name on the List should come to the assembly hail. Last night, someone attempted to steal the Secret Manuscript. The thief, who is associated with SONG Hak-rim, was also involved in poisoning the principal! Luckily we caught him red-handed. But I have decided I shouldn't hide the Secret Manuscript from you any more. My beloved students of Volcano High, finally... ..I disclose the Secret Manuscript to you. - Oh, wow! - The real Manuscript! Here! Open your eyes. Watch carefully what happens when you covet what belongs to the teachers. Empty! Empty him so that he can be ready for the teachings with a new mind! Your mind is full of useless thoughts Like rebelliousness and Lust! This is the teaching of the great Secret Manuscript! The history of education will be rewritten today. Rewritten! Rewritten! Under the name of the great Volcano High! It will clean out the rubbish and dirt from your mind. The one and only great Secret Manuscript! Now, you pupils are given a chance to start a new Life. You are reborn! Please stop it. I can't bear it any more. You've got a quick temper. It's not your turn yet. You know it's your turn without even being called. Is this your way to develop one's personality? Yes, and it's a most necessary class for a student Like you. Stop right there. I have to take JANG Ryang to the sick bay. It seems somebody's done a useless job on you. JANG Ryang has to go to the sick bay! Then get my permission first. Disobedient pupils Like you create dissonance. You stupid prat! Wake up! Stay away. This is my business. Don't be a hero. It's me, JANG Ryang! I get job satisfaction when I teach a pupil Like you. - I'm not running away anymore. - Your Life is over. Mr Ma! Be careful when you say my Life is over. Don't come near me. Don't! Mr Ma! Don't come! Don't! Don't come. Don't come... There is only one sun in the sky. There shouldn't be two No.1s at Volcano High. Let's see who deserves to be that one. I thought this issue was finished. I've waited for this moment for the sake of vengeance. I am not finished yet. I am busy. Get to the point. Please, vice principal... As time went by, I couldn't endure my curiosity about the Secret Manuscript. You... You students, I haven't finished talking. We ail know it was an empty case right from the start. Liar. You Littlie Liar! Kids, it was real...it's here, the Secret Manuscript! Breaking school property, violence towards other boys and...violence towards the student dean! Can you tell me where KIM Kyung-soo's classroom is? Why do you write when you don't have nerve to show them to him? Love is...not about showing, it's about making him feel it. If I write another 200 times, that will make 1000 Letters.
