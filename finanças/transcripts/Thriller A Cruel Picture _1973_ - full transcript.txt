Good morning, Frigga. How is the milk today? One quart. I must say you're looking very pretty today, Frigga. That's good. Your mother says you're feeling better lately. Thank you. Have a good day. I feel sorry for that poor girl. Such a shame. They say she'll never talk again. I just get so damn mad. I know. But, what about her parents? They just love her too much. Poor people. They spend everything they've got sending her to those special doctors... and she'll still never be right in the head. Mark my words. What's it been? Fifteen years now? Sure. Someone said that old man is dead now. He never even went to prison. What kind of laws have we got anyway? Putting a crazy man back on the streets so he can rape another little girl? If it was up to me, I woulda hanged him! I don't understand why she can't talk, though. Do you? Well, the doctor said it was the shock. Who knows about these things? Frigga. You'd better hurry. You can't be late for your appointment with the doctor. You can't afford to miss a treatment. I'll bet you can't give me one reason why you shouldn't ride with me into town. Hi. Tony's the name. I just picked up this car today. Terrific, huh? 3000 GT. 357 horses. Got yourself a pad way out here in the sticks? Huh? You hooked up with somebody, babe? I had them put on every accessory they got... but the one thing they don't include is a chick to drive around with. Hey, let's have something to eat. Credit cards pay for everything. The menu, Monsieur. I think we'll start with cheese and herring... and then the pepper steak flambe for two... Figs in cognac flamb√© for dessert. With the entree a nice Burgundy. But first, champagne. I know a lot of chicks. Most of them don't know how to keep quiet, but... I think you set a new record. Come on. Straight ahead. Here, let me put some light on the subject. Let's get rid of this, huh... Yeah, that's cool. Sit down. Well, I've got a great bottle of wine inside. Here we go. Here, relax. To us. What's the matter? You're not drinking. This stuff's too good to waste. Cost me a fortune. To us. Hi, sweetheart. Is the doctor in? It's Tony. Is he with a patient? That's good. Tell him it's me. Uh huh. Yeah, it's Tony. You better bring some of the stuff over, right away. Just bring whatever you need. The money's here, no problem. No worries. She's sleeping. Right away, yeah. Hello sweetheart, it's Tony. I just found another one. I'll have her ready in ten days. Yeah, that's right. That makes five this year. I figure in another couple years we'll have all the money we need. I'll call you tomorrow. Right. Well, that was fast. She's on the couch. She's out like a light. Yeah, don't get excited. Ah! Just sign your name at the bottom. The copy, too. Here. I didn't say anything about reading. Just sign it, baby. Well, have a nice rest? All right, sweetheart. Here's the setup. I've been pumping you full of heroin. I don't mean the watered down crap they push on the street, either. The cleanest, strongest stuff you can find. So, what I'm saying is very simply, you've been hooked... and without your jolt, you can last 48 hours at best. But we won't have that problem, right? If you cooperate with me, you'll get what you need... and everybody will be happy. Ow! Goddamn bitch! "You never knew how bored I was living on that farm. I never saw anybody under fifty. I lived your way long enough. I'm gonna live my way from now on. I want to see the world. If it were up to you, I'd still be wearing starch dresses and pigtails. Well, I'm grown up now and I'm going to do what I want. Whether you like it or not. I finally found somebody who really loves me... and understands the way I feel. I want to forget the both of you... and your phony sympathy. I don't expect you to understand. Just accept it. I made up my mind. I don't care what you think about it, either. And if you haven't figured it out... this is the last letter you're going to get. Goodbye." It's just signed "Frigga". Well, baby, you begin a whole new life today. You'll get two of these every day if you cooperate... and do as you're told. Your first customer will be here at 1:00. You make sure he goes away happy. Come on. Let check out your happy new home. He'll be here any minute now. See that you please him. So you're the new one. Well, take off your clothes. Tony, you son of a bitch! Look what she did to me! How can I go home like this? What am I gonna tell my wife? Are you crazy bringing in broads like that? My God! I'll be scarred for life! Oh, fine. Fine. Which one? Yeah. Oh yeah. "One Eye", you mean. Let's see... Let's see... You said Friday? She's free at two o'clock. Yeah. But, she'll cost you more than Sally would. Yeah. She's better, that's why. Okay, I'll write you in. My pleasure. See you Friday. Well... Now that all the unpleasantness is out of the way... and you're ready to work... we'll pick up where we left off. Every morning at 9:00, I'll give you your list of appointments... and the makings for two fixes, to get you through the day. Monday's your free day. That means you'll be getting twice as much of the stuff on Sunday morning... to hold you until Tuesday. Do a good job, and you may earn a bonus from time to time. That's the deal. You dig? All right, you start the morning with one of our winners... Mr. Weirdo Anderson. Hmm? What? Oh, yes you're right. Here you are. Get undressed. I'm Sally. I know what you're going through. It's always worse at the beginning. You just want to crawl into bed and die. In a few weeks, it'll pass. Take my word for it. Don't try to do without the stuff. At least it'll keep you going. I tried it once. One night, I crawled out of a window. Thumbed a ride, and went back home. To mama. In less than a day, I fell apart. I was climbing walls. I would have died if Tony's hoods hadn't come for me. Real gentlemen. You know, the kind that will knife their own grandmother. Well anyway, I was almost glad when they brought me back. The most you can go is about 36 hours. Then it gets real bad. You begin to shake. There's no way to stop it, either. You feel like you're dying. It was horrible. I'll never be able to forget it. Some day, I'll be out of here. I've got a plan. I started to hit all the customers for extra money. For a little extra service. In about a year, I'll have enough money to leave here... and take off for Switzerland. They've got this new narcotics clinic there. I found out about it. It takes four months, they say... and you come away cured. But it costs a hell of a lot. You pay $6000 in advance... but it'll be worth it. I just want to get out. Sometimes, I can't stop crying. I don't know why. I'm all right. I was just going to come into your room anyway. I stole this out of Tony's mail. "Your letter came as a terrible shock to your father and me. How can our little girl hate us so much? Do you really feel this way? Do you realize that your letter nearly Killed your father? Last Friday night, he slashed his wrists. They say he'll be all right, but I'm afraid he might try it again. Neither of us can understand your hatred. But, if you ever change your mind about us darling... just remember one thing. Your parents are here. We'll be here waiting for our little girl... to return to us again. Darling, please darling... please come home to us. Frigga, without our little girl we have nothing to live for. Nothing." I'm glad I wasn't the one who found them. Imagine walking in there and seeing them both dead. Yes, and dead for three days! What a sight. Suicide's a terrible thing. You never know what's going on in people's minds, do you? Oh, I could see it coming. These past few weeks they were so depressed... I guess suicide was the only way out. And, it's all that girl's fault. Well, she wasn't the one who poisoned them. She might just as well have poisoned her parents... with that horrible letter she wrote them. - But, we don't know for sure. - What else could it have been but the letter? But, one thing I do know for sure... they took it very hard. Very hard! A little more forward. Bend at the waist. Try to keep your legs straight and roll over. No. Watch me. Hi. I never taught a girl how to drive this buggy. But, I'm willing to try. Get In. I'll take half for now. Let's see what you can do. We'll begin training with this weapon. It's a Mauser, and was used in both world wars. Quite effectively, I might add. All right, lie down. A little further back. That's good. Now, cradle the butt of the weapon against your shoulder. A little more... Now, look through the sight. Ok. You're ready to load. Lower the weapon. Pull back the bolt. Straight back, like this. Insert the cartridge clip. Press it down and push the bolt forward. Hold the butt against your shoulder. A little higher. Look through the sight... and squeeze the trigger. Never pull. Good. Now, pull back the bolt to eject the cartridge... push it forward, and down. A little higher. And, squeeze it off gently. You'll be getting a new customer this morning. See that it goes well. This is Tony. Well, we haven't seen you for a while. Yes. Fine. We're busy. I don't have too much to complain about. This Friday? Well, let's see... Got the book here. Friday? Friday. Friday... Come back. Try it again. You have a tendency to strike too soon. Get in closer. Like this... All right, come straight ahead. That's better. Come back. Eyes straight ahead. Move in! I want to show you something. Say you come into a big curve... and you begin to skid. Always steer into the skid. Never try to pull your wheels over the other way. Hold it till you come out here... then give it the gas again. Right foot behind... now bring the arm over and behind... turn his body and apply leverage. Get out! You wait here. I brought a little surprise for you today. An extra fix. Oh, our friend Sally is gone. She asked if we could move her to some other city. We try to accommodate people. Yeah. Well, I know we all hope she'll be happy. Come on! Easy lady! All right, that's enough! There's not much more I can teach you. Ten bulls eyes. I'd say your training's over. You want hard stuff and a new car, too? You got the cash? Come on. I'll need two more big ones for all this. You know how expenses are going up. See you. Ahhhhhhhhhhh! Three beers. We've got a peck of trouble. Frigga killed one of her regular clients yesterday... and, I'm betting she's out to get the three of us. I've booked a couple of airplane tickets for you. Stay away at least a couple of weeks. Just lay low until I straighten it out. Damn! Yeah? Yeah? Rod, listen, this is Tony. Get over here right away. Got a rush job for you. Huh? What? It's always been $1000! Because it's not worth that much money to me. I pay $1000, that's it. Yeah? What do you want? What? Axelsson? Slow down... Scared? Who? Old Tony? You better believe it! She's high on horse! She's liable to do anything. I'll have a contract out on her this morning. All right, it'll cost. Listen! I think we better put a lid on the whole operation... while we get this cleared up. You agree? I can handle everything on this end... if you wanna get out of town for a little while. Right. I've gotta go. The boys are just coming in now. I'll be in touch. Yeah. All right, here's the scam. Frigga killed three of her customers yesterday. Find out where she's getting her stuff, and set her up. Then get rid of her. I'm cleaned out. Finished. I don't have any more. But, if you're willing to pay... there's the hot dog man down at the docks. He'll fix ya up. Ahhhhhhhhhhh! Ahhhhhhhhhhh! Well, I'll be a son of a bitch! She's really gone off the deep end. She challenges me to a duel. I can pick my choice of weapons. She ought to be put away. She's crazy. But crazy or not, I've got to get rid of her. I'll fix her ass for her. Hey, we ought to be able to talk this over, Frigga. Huh? I came out here to offer you a deal. How about coming in with me as a full partner? You see, I'm a reasonable man. Why don't you put the gun down and we'll talk? Frigga, come on. Frigga? That was stupid! You better start praying, One Eye! Now I'm gonna teach you what it means to threaten me, you little bitch! And I'm gonna enjoy it!
