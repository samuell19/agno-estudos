Daphne! 'Daphne! What's the matter? You've got to help me. Come in, come in. What is it, darling? Kay, what? What is it? In the kitchen... He's dead. I should be... Is it who I think it is? Yes. Come on. Right down. Come on. Now, tell me. What is there to tell? It's done. I, I... Come on, you've got to get a hold of yourself. This has to be faced. What happened? You remember, a week, ten days ago, I don't know. Louise went off on her vacation. Yes. It was a Saturday. There was no school for Timmy. We drove her down to the bus... down to the pier. Au revoir, Louise. Bon vacances. Merci, madame. Au revior, Timmy. El sois bein sage. Oui. I will. - Bon jour, monsieur. - Bon jour, madame. Well, I told you what our Ensign would do with his shore leave. The Picasso of the Sixth Fleet. Hey, Mark, we're going up to the casino later. Why don't you join us? Nope. Picasso saves his dough. Okay, Grandpa Moses. Hi, sailor, sir. Hi there. I'm an American, too. You are? What ship are you from? Crazy. Which is yours? The carrier out there. - You're a pilot, huh? - Engine room. What're you drawing? Right now, that medieval tower over there. In the old town. Why don't you get closer to it? I will eventually, if I can get a cab. You want a ride up there? We'll drive you. - Who's we? - Why me and my mom... Come along, Timmy, I think you've bothered this gentleman long enough. I'm sorry if... He's from the carrier, mom. The engine room. He wants to paint that old tower close up. He can't get a cab and I said we'd drive him. You've got a nice hospitable son but believe me, I don't want to intrude. I know how kids can speak out. Not at all. I'd be delighted. I just have to drop him off at the house to meet a friend and I'll drive you on. It's only a few minutes farther. Well, it'd be the nicest ride, I ever thumbed. - But you're sure? - Absolutely. The car's right there. I'm Kay Stanton. Mrs. Neil Stanton. Mark Dominic, here. Ensign. Very well, Mr. Dominic. We're off. - Come along, Timmy. - I'll help him, mom. They're not here yet. We might have to wait a little for the children's bus. Would you like to come in? Fine. Funny, the names on these French Villas. That means "Roosters." I figured that one. My next door neighbor has a quaint one, "Le lit d'un Ange." Let's see the bed of... That's right, "The bed of an angel." Sounds like a peaceful household. Well. Get your jacket, Timmy. It'll be cool by evening. Okay, mom. They really do these very nicely. Genuine Sixteenth Century Provencal farmhouse. Built around 1950. How'd you know that? I've always wanted to be an architect. Bon jour, Madame Stanton. Monsieur. Where's Timmy? Bon jour, Pierre. Timmy. Pierre's here. Alo, Pierre. Je suis pret! Un moment! Mais no use sommes en retard! Les roches! Le piquenique! Now, Timmy, you don't have to take Julius... But I want to take Julius, mom. He needs the exercise. So long, sailor, sir. Hope I see you again. Same here, Tim. - Bye, mom. - Have fun. We will. Oh boy, a rock hunt. AU revior. Pierre's mother runs the school Timmy goes to. They're off on a rock hunt. And who's Julius? A small, green, and rather unhappy lizard. On a rock hunt? I give up. I'll put these in water and we're on our way. Sure. Well! Hello. Hi. Where's Kay? Mrs. Stanton? Arranging some flowers. Little celebration of some sort? - I don't know. - Oh, I'm Mrs. Fields. Daphne Fields, the next door neighbor. I'm Mark Dominic. An old friend of Kay's? Just met. I'm off the carrier. She was kind enough to give me a ride up the hill. Well, bully for her. - Daphne! - Oh, there you are, darling. Look I'm in a frightful dither. Half the Navy's going to arrive in a few minutes and I'm out of vodka. Could you manage a couple of bottles? Sure. You've introduced yourselves? Naturally. How about you breaking down just for once, and inviting this charming man to the party? Oh, no thanks really. I must be shoving off. He's an artist. He wants to paint the old tower up on the hill. There goes Louise, she's locked the liquor cabinet. She claims the gardener will steal a bottle and then try to attack her. Gee, you ought to see Louise. She should be that lucky. Now, look what I've found in her room. She told me she wanted one, I said absolutely no, and she went ahead and got one. - Is that loaded? - I don't know. Here. These things go off if you breathe on them. It's loaded. Honestly, Kay, that woman's simply dotty. When that psychiatrist husband of yours comes back from traipsing all over the continent I'd have him put her on the couch. We certainly can't have this. That'll do it? Thanks awfully. That is sweet of you. Well I must fly. Oh, uh, listen, Kay's allergic to my parties, but if you should change your mind, drop over. Really, I can't this time. Alright, I'll give you a rain check on it, any time you're in port. It's Le Lit de'un Ange. And don't take it literally. Au revior. Now, what'll I do with that gun? With Timmy around I have to... Up high some place, where he's least likely to come across it. Let me see. I know the kitchen. Would you, uh... - Sure. - Please help me. There, how about in one of those? Good. I'll put this here and... there. That should do it. Thank goodness. Neil would have been furious. Your husband's a doctor, I gather? A psychiatrist? Hmm. He's in Zurich now, at a convention. Does he practice here? No, he's Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University. We're over here on his sabbatical, a vacation supposedly. Excuse me. Mrs. Fields? OI' Dick Blogett told us to drop by. This is Lieutenant Commander Lee... I'm sorry gentlemen, you've got the wrong house. Mrs. Fields? Right next door. Oh, pardon me, ma'am. Thanks. Uh, but I sure would settle for this one. - You ought to switch names. - How? I mean her place should be called the Rooster and this place the Bed of an... I wouldn't judge Daphne too harshly. She's had an unhappy marriage and she's just searching. Looking I guess. She's a very warm friend by the way. It's 2 o'clock, we must go. You've been so darn nice. May I take you to lunch some place? - Oh, no really... - Look I'm hungry. And I'm sure you must be. Well... Louise left a bowl of chicken salad for me. I'd be glad to share it with you, if you'd care to. That'd be wonderful. We can eat out on the patio, if you wanna go out and take in the view. Fine. I'm sorry. I didn't offer anything to drink. Oh, no, thank you. - Sure? - I don't drink. That's a surprise from a sailor. Oh, I've made a noble try, but only a couple of drinks and then depending on my mood, I either wanna laugh myself stupid or tear the town apart. Very sensible. Chicken salad coming up. But here I'm telling you the story of my life. Go ahead. My mother's death really hit dad pretty hard. And you see, having been Navy all his life he retired a chief. He wanted me to be an officer, and go to Annapolis, and he sure scrimped to give me the education to make it. I couldn't disappoint him. Of course not, Mark. Mother, she... thanks for the Mark, by the way. Why not? Just thanks. Anyway, Mother, she understood the architecture bit, but dad, he claims all good Greeks have been seafaring men. But I'm sure some of my ancestors must have designed a temple or two. You've got a decision to make, haven't you? I'll do my three years anyway. It's nice to talk to someone like this. Kay? Kay, have you gone? Out here. Oh. Here you are. Well, how very cozy. So you didn't go painting after all. You know, darling, I can quite understand your wanting to keep him to yourself. What is it, Daphne? Well, you'll never believe it, but I need another bottle of vodka. I've got an endless stream of guests. You'd think they were Russians. Of course. Why you little devil you. Honestly, darling, where did you find him? I didn't interrupt your posing, did I? Daphne, you're behaving like a complete idiot. Now take this and go. Well, I don't blame you with Neil away all the time. Oh, goodbye, Mr. Dominic. Don't forget my rain check. Goodbye. Remember, darling, don't be like me have the game but avoid the name. I apologize for her. Oh, a little stoned, I guess. - I'd better get going. - Yes, we should. Oh, no thanks. I'll just walk down the hill. The exercise will do me good. I'd be happy to drive you up to the old town. No. The light's gone now anyway. I sure thank you for the lunch. You're very welcome. Sometime whenever we're in port, would you like to bring Timmy out to the ship? If my husband's here, we'd be delighted to. He comes home Wednesday. Oh, that'd be fine. I'm sorry, your afternoon was wasted. It wasn't wasted. Not wasted one bit. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Thank you. Dr. Stanton ici... - Mrs. Stanton calling. - Oui. - Neil? - Kay! Kay, sweetheart. How are you? Oh, fine. Well no, let's face it, I'm lonely as all get out. I'm counting the days until Wednesday. Mister, will you get a welcome. Honey, look, Wednesday's out. I'm just about to leave for London. I've been asked to give a series of lectures at the Academy. Then on up to Edinburgh for a week's seminar. Neil. This is supposed to be your sabbatical, remember? Your vacation, ours, remember? Not to mention we planned and looked forward to it for seven years. You think I don't miss you too? Please try to understand, Kay. I will. I do, dear. - How's Timmy? - Oh, fine. He and Pierre took Julius on a rock hunt. - Oh! Great. - Your cab is waiting, sir. Oh, uh, look, honey... Oh, I hate to ring off on my best girl like this, but my cab's here. I gotta run. I'm too far away to hold you, get going. I'll be staying at the Dorchester in London. I love you. Goodbye now. Me too. Goodbye. Timmy. Are you up? All dressed. Can I turn the percolator on? Thanks, dear. Hey, I just looked out the window, the fleet's gone. That's good. Why is it good? I mean they're... they're off on exercises. It shows somebody's minding the store. What store? The country's store. Yours and mine, dopey. Oh, yeah. I get it. I love you, mom. "Dear Mrs. Stanton. Realizing that your husband is home “by now, I'd be delighted if you and he and Timmy "would join me on the terrace of the Carleton Hotel about noon this Saturday." "It will be visitors day and I hope you'll allow me "to take the family aboard for Timmy's sake "as well as mine. Sincerely, Mark Dominic." Sorry, I'm late, darling. Well, where's young Captain Hornblower? He said around noon. I can't imagine him standing you up. Anyway, here I'm as promised, your protective camouflage. Daphne, would you please stop trying to read something into this that isn't there. Listen, you could have had him paged, you know. Left a message explaining, polite but firm. - Oh, Daphne. - Oh, come on. I'm only pulling your leg. After such a nice decent invitation, the least I could do is... Here he is. Hello. Nice to see you again. You remember Mrs. Fields. - Of course. - Few men forget, sir. Um, Dr. Stanton's bringing Timmy? I'm sorry. Dr. Stanton's still in London. I know he'd would have enjoyed it. Oh, that's too bad. But what about Timmy? There was no way to let you know, but Timmy's had this weekend planned for a long time. Madame Dubois and her husband have taken the children up to the mountains for the last of the snow. Anyhow, it was nice of you to show up. And Mrs. Fields, of course. Well, as I said some other time when Neil's home. You bet. May I buy you a drink? - Nothing for me, thank you. - Wait a minute. You're the would be artist, aren't you? Architecture or something? Well, the least we can do for this poor lost soul is to give him the grand tour. You know, the old hillside towns back of here. Have you seen them? I've wanted to do that since we first dropped anchor. Can we? It's a marvelous idea, Daphne. Leave the station wagon here and with the top down on my car he'll have a much better... Darling, you don't think I'm including me? I'll never look ancient bricks in the face again. Beginning to look a bit like mirrors. - Daphne? - Besides I've got a date. Actually, he is a bit ancient himself. Nice to have seen you again. Have fun. And if it's clear when we get up here, you can see the snow peaks where Timmy's gone. Oh, yeah, sure. Timmy. Did he take Julius with him this time? Julius is no longer with us. - Deceased. - No. Escaped. Pierre was holding him and, uh, he decided to bite, so Pierre dropped him and he got away. Lucky Julius. You know you're much prettier than most French bus drivers. Thank you. Here we are, Mougina. Mm. This is something. See anything you'd like to paint? Plenty. Here. It's a beautiful fountain. It only needs your profile in the foreground. I think you caught me studying it when we started out. Perfect. Don't give me that old Greek coin bit. We're gathering a crowd. Ever played boule before? No. Spares and strikes? You see how close you can come to that little yellow ball. Vous permettez, messieur? Merci. - You stand in this circle. - Um-hmm. Then you take two balls. - You're on. - Nothing to it. No, no. You have to click them together first. Why? Don't ask me. Nothing to it. That was practice. Nothing to it. - Magnifique. - Merci, Messieur. Make a fool out of me. It's not fair. We play that all the time at the house. - Now, where? - Well, let's see. You certainly should see the new art gallery in St. Paul-de-Vence. You've been to all these places a million times before, haven't you? Yes, but... Look, I don't feel particularly arty all of a sudden. Something more exciting, huh. How about the casino? No go. Not in uniform. Oh yeah. How's this? Horse races in Nice. French Provencial style? No kidding? You like horse races? I love them. If we hurry, we can catch the last four. - Come on. - Oh great. You're trailing. I'm just being polite. Look at her. Look at her come. Look at her run. Well now, how about tomorrow? I'm busy tomorrow. Monday then. I've got three days leave and... - Mark. - What? I'm not going to see you again. Why? Just because I... Because it's wrong. I'm married to a wonderful man and I love him very much. I know. You're just lonely, sailor. Really now. You should accept Daphne's invitation. She knows every pretty unattached girl in town. I might. Good luck, Mark. Thanks, Kay, you too. Hi. I was just coming in to say goodbye to you. Where are you off to? Villefrance, for a couple of days or so. Well, of course that rather depends on him. Do I know him? No you don't. But just wait till you do. I'm upping myself in rank. A full commander. Man of distinction type. You know handsome, touch of grey on the sides a widower and independently wealthy. Every goody in the book. When are you going to stop being so naughty? That's rather easy for you say, isn't it? You've got Neil and Timmy. Still, don't stop me trying. Daphne... I'm sorry, I had no right to say that. Rubbish. You had every right. Let's face it, I should get a V for vagrancy. Oh, how was yesterday with young Hornblower? We had a very pleasant time. You seeing him again? No. I'm not going to see him anymore. I thought as much. You're smart. Well, wish me luck. I might break the bank with my three striper. - Bye. - Bye. Good morning, Dorchester Hotel. One moment, please. Yes. Mrs. Stanton calling sir, long distance. Oh, put her on please. Go ahead, Mrs. Stanton. Neil! Sweetheart, hello. How are you? Fine, dear. Just fine. I just took a chance. I thought you might have gone on to Edinburgh. No. No lecturing on Sundays, darling. Tomorrow. Neil, I've had a marvelous brainstorm. Why don't I pack up Timmy and myself and join you in Scotland? But look, Kay, it's not such a good idea to take Timmy out of school just now, is it? No, I suppose not. Oh, well it was just an idea anyway. Heaven knows I could do with a look at you. But Louise is on her vacation, isn't she? And you could hardly leave him with Daphne. No. Oh, well. What are you doing today? They're picking me up and taking me out to, uh... Lord and Lady Somebody's place in Surrey. I think they're having a cricket match. Hmm. That'll be relaxing for you, won't it? Give my best to the wicket. Kay darling, don't be angry. Is anything wrong? No, I'm fine. Just being mean because I'm lonely, that's all. Let me know where you're staying in Edinburgh, huh? And, uh, hurry on home. Will I? I love you. Me too. Bye, darling. Bye, sweetheart. I, I tried to call you from the airport. I took a friend to the plane, but your line was out of order then disconnected or something. Mark, I thought you understood what I... Oh, I know. I kept the cab waiting. I just wanted to drop by with a present for Timmy. It's a game for everybody as a matter of fact. That's very sweet of you, Mark. It's a sort of a farewell present really because I won't be hanging around here after tomorrow. We got orders last night. We're pulling out in the morning. Going back to the states. Anyhow, it's all been great. So, so long, Kay. Bye, Mark. Maybe, if I'd write you'd answer, huh? Mark? I was just about to drive down for a swim. Would you like to come along? Would I? Hey, le addition. Pour le taxi. Vite, Vite... That was fast. Battle stations. Is that your dog tag in case you get wounded? If you're in that big a hurry, let's go. Okay. Ooh, it's freezing. Come on. Ooh. It's cold. Let's see now. "First one that makes it topple is a Square." The second time you're a character and the third time you're a blockhead and out. You're through. The boys aboard ship pass around quite a lot of money playing this. It's fun. Where'd you find it? Nice airport. The last set they had. The girl didn't wanna sell it to me because there was a piece missing. That little, yellow heart-shaped piece there. It had fallen out on display or something but you can still play without it. I've had too much sun, I think. If we wanna go to that Art Gallery at St. Paul-de-Vence, we better get started. Sure. I'll do that. You hop to it. Right. You like this place? It's beautiful. The Colombe d'Or? The Golden Dove. But why Golden? The birds are all white. You'll find out. Any moment. What more can I find out? What's the name of that, piece, please? It's lovely. D'un instant a L'autre, madame. A moment to moment. Merci. Funny, that's me. How? Moment to moment. That's what I'm living right now. There they go. Now watch. It's breathtaking. See? They've turned to gold. Every afternoon just as the sun sets they fly out to say goodbye to the day. Me, I can't. We should go, Mark. Your hand is shaking. Why'? I don't know. The storm, the mistral. It always makes me a little nervous. Kay. Mark... It isn't the storm and I can't say goodbye to the day. I can't say goodbye to you again, Kay. Mark. No. Please. Kay, I thought you were... You're so beautiful. So beyond anything beautiful. No, Mark, please. You have to listen to me. What, Kay? What's wrong? Almost everything. Now that I realize what I've done. Everything. Wrong? What's happened to us is wrong? I'm in love with you, Kay. It's right. And it's going to be that from now on. Forever. All we have to do is to decide what to do is... Oh, Kay, darling, for you to think that what... That's just it. That's the wrong. I've led you to believe something that isn't true. What is true then? Because of you. Not stopping to think or care. It was some sort of animal hunger with no thought of Neil or my life with him. I'm so ashamed. Please... Please, forgive me. Well, what's to forgive? Hunger and ashamed, huh! Well, if you can toss it off with a drink, I guess I can. Mark, I'm trying not to hurt you. I wouldn't hurt you for anything in the world. Am I bleeding some place? You can forget this. Sure, place it away in my memory book along with my high school diploma. Don't drink anymore. Why not, huh? Maybe it will put things in proportion this time. Spell it all out clear. Why sure. It's simple. She just played hard to get, that's all. Not like that English dame with a neon sign, but very subtle. She teases you along. - Part of the jollies. - Oh, Mark. Watch out for the gal in the red Citroen, fellows. She sends her little boy over to pick you up. And the maid's on a vacation. And the husband's out of town. The poor chump! She stages it beautifully. First off she listens to the story of your life. The next she gives you the tired bit about not seeing you anymore. But you're hooked, mister. Because at the same time she let's you know you've rung that little bell. Oh, yes, and her little boy's away for the weekend. Up in the snow. Then she takes you around the old towns and shows you the architecture. Then she takes you swimming and gives you an eyeful of hers. Then she starts to simmer. All of a sudden you wind up in the henhouse, buddy, and you're one of the roosters. You crow at midnight! Oh, Mark! But she's, she's classy. She's top drawer. We always pay accordingly, huh? There's a 150 in that. Pick it up. Pick it up. Damn you, pick it up. Kay, Kay, Kay, Kay. Darling, I'm sorry. Please open the door. No, Mark! Mark. Mark. Mark. Mark, stop it! I'm gonna shoot the lock of that door. Nobody's gonna lock you away from me. Mark, give me that gun, Mark. Maybe, you and I go together, Mark. Mark! Kay? Kay, let me in. Kay, it's me, Daphne. Did you hear that shot, then a scream? Yes, I thought it might be a car and some tire scraping. Oh, it didn't seem as if it came from the road. It was almost as if it came from here. It scared me to death. I... I'm sorry. I, I don't, uh... Hey, what's the matter with you? You alright? Just groggy, I guess. I took a sleeping pill. Oh. Do you mind if I take a drink? I'm cold and still shaking. I thought you were in Ville France. I just got back. He's rather a dear, my commander. Do you know I could quite easily fall in love with him. - Oh, well. - I'm sorry, Daphne. I'm afraid I'm not very good company tonight. - It's late and... - Oh, that's alright, darling. There's always tomorrow. - 'Night. - Goodnight. You know that's funny, I could have sworn that was a shot and then... Oh, well, if it was a murder or something, we'll hear about it. Go on back to bed. See you in the morning. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Daphne! Daphne! What's the matter? You've got to help me. Come on inside. Come on. Not a clue. Nothing, nothing, nothing. Well, there's nothing here. No. Nothing. Oh, it's no use looking, it would certainly be on the front page. It's been four days now. I'm going out my mind. He could still be lying out there. Don't be ridiculous, darling. You phoned the police. Which wasn't such a good idea anyway, but I couldn't stop you. You told them exactly where he was. The shrine and everything. Anyway, I've got to know. I'm responsible. I, I practically killed him. And with Neil coming home... Listen, darling, you've gotta pull yourself together. And leave well enough alone. It's quite possible the Navy's is keeping it quiet. Anyway, I've got to know. - Kay. - Are you coming with me? Certainly not. Now listen to me, Kay. I'm going now. You're out of your mind. Alright. Just one minute. Have you thought what you'll do, if he's still there? Madame Stanton. One moment please. A word, please? You're Madame Neil Stanton? At least your license plates are registered in that name. I am. Allow me. - Yes. - I'm here on business, madame. I'm Inspector Albie of Cannes. Officer Givet. Lieutenant Commander Hendricks, head of the American Shore Patrol in this area. How do you do. May we continue this conversation indoors, madame? Certainly. Forgive me for being rather puzzled. I should enlighten you, madame. What a charming interior. Delightful. I so dislike leaving Paris during the season but now I am compensated. Yes, Madame Stanton can you explain why you stopped your car on the road to Vallauris about an hour ago? Opposite the roadside shrine. Certainly. My scarf had blown off and I stopped to pick it up. You did not then, uh, let us say, drop it over the side of the car? Uh, no. How utterly ridiculous. You were observed very closely, madame. Inspector Albie's binoculars. They've been used continuously to cover that area ever since the body of an American officer was found in the ditch there. A body? Exactly. That of an Ensign. Ensign Mark Dominic. A prepossessingly handsome young man. Even in... Well, did you know him? I'm sorry. - How perfectly awful. - Isn't it? Uh, do you or your husband own a small firearm, say the type of a 25 caliber? Of course not. I wouldn't have such a thing around the house. Not with an inquisitive eight-year-old son. Most sensible. After you picked up your scarf you stood for a while looking, why? I always enjoy the view from there. Ahh, but most of the time you spent looking down into the ditch and it was noted that your expression was quite disturbed. That. Inspector De Fargo, have you ever seen a woman who has forgotten her marketing list and is trying to remember what was on it? Touche, madame. Yet later you spent almost an hour in the church. Still trying to remember? Or at confession perhaps. Inspector, this is a startling case you're working on. Why haven't... Cigarette? No, thank you. - Gentlemen. - Thank you, mademoiselle. - You're saying, madame? - Thank you. Why haven't I been reading about this in the papers? Well, we kept it from the press because I rather felt that a woman who telephoned the police the night of the shooting, would one day return to the spot to make sure the body was gone. I see, I'm beginning to understand why you should jump to the conclusion... And also the temptation of the criminal to return to the scene of the crime. Of course. Did you telephone the police about the body in the ditch? Inspector De Fargo, once and for all... Do you speak French, madame? - Yes. - Then this will aid you. Will you please repeat to me in French the following. "You will find the body of an American officer in the ditch on the road to Vallauris, opposite the roadside shrine." Is this cloak and dagger really necessary? Do me the honor, madame. Vous trouverez le corps. Much faster. Vous trouverez le corps d'un American dans le fosse juste en face d'un petite chapelle sur la route de Vallaruis. Merci. You speak excellent French, madame. Thank you. But of course, a trace of an accent. Naturally. The lady who telephoned the police that night also had an accent, either American or English we're not quite sure. Madame Stanton, that Sunday night, where were you? I was here. With your husband? Dr. Stanton was in London. Now in Edinburgh. The servants? Our maid's on her vacation. And your young son? He was away for the weekend. So you were alone. Yes. Americans and others who live in Cannes frequently entertain members of the fleet when the ships put in here. On Sunday night were you entertaining an American officer, perhaps? Inspector DeFargo. After all, the young men are a long ways from home. And so is my husband. Forgive me, but sometimes that offers an ideal opportunity to entertain a male visitor. Please have the good taste not to waste my time or yours by being insulting. My apologies. Now, Madame Stanton, I want you to consider very carefully before you answer my next question. Did you shoot Ensign Dominic? Or did he possibly shoot himself? Inspector, I thought I conveyed to you that I... You see, madame, report radioed from Ensign Dominic's carrier included the fact that the previous evening he had just drawn his pay about a $150 and it was found on his person. So that indicates that the event did not happen in some low establishment. The motive was not robbery, but possibly stemmed from some sort of extreme emotion. N'est ce pas, madame? Aren't you nearly through, inspector? Nearly. The bedrooms are up here, of course? Yes. It would not be too difficult. One man could have handled it. Or two ladies. Particularly, if one lady owned a station wagon such as you neighbor, Madame Fields. Inspector, I have a great many things to do. I realize. We have inconvenienced you too long. Come, gentlemen. I must ask for your passport. My passport? We think it would be better if you did not leave the country before this little matter is cleared up. I'm not even sure where it is, frankly. My husband always takes care of that sort of thing. When will your husband be home? He returns the day after tomorrow. Very well then. Inspector Albie will present himself and pick it up at that time. Wait. I, uh, just remembered where it might be. Albie will wait for it. Au revoir, madame. Yes, they've already transported the body. Your passport, please. We'll have it checked for fingerprints. - Oui. - Oui. - Madame Fields. - Yes. Inspector DeFargo, Police Judicial, Paris. Lieutenant Commander Hendricks. Would you allow us a few moments? Uh, please. What on earth have I done this time? I haven't had a parking ticket for ages. A few questions, madame. I know what it is. Don't tell me. It's those terrible old sour-faced Bouche's sisters just across the street. They threatened to complain, you know, but quite honestly I didn't think they'd have the nerve. I swear to you inspector that my parties are the absolute utmost in decorum. I keep the record player low like that all times. And I mean, the boys from the Fleet are such absolute darlings and so well behaved. I mean just a few drinks and some dancing. Uh, would you like something? No thank you. Madame... Honestly, the way those two old bags carry on you'd think I was running a... Well, I... I know it's quite possible they might slip out on the lawn or the back porch for a quiet bit of smooching, but looking at you, inspector, I'm sure you understand. Madame, your entertaining is not in question. Do you know a young officer, Ensign Mark Dominic? Dominic? Dominic? No, I'm sure not. In any case ensigns are rather young, aren't they? Where were you last Sunday night, around midnight? Last Sunday night... Now, let me think. I was here at home. Yes, alone. During the evening did you hear anything sounding like a gunshot? A shot? No. Why? What happened? Please read aloud in French... Albie... what is on this card. "You'll find the body of an American officer..." - You mean there was a murder... - If you please, madame. I'll not keep you further. - In French? - In French, please. Vous trouvez le corps de el official de American dans... dans. What's the word for ditch? - Fosse. - Dans la fosse. Well, it's all very well for you, but I can tell you frankly that I haven't gotten very much further than la plume de ma tante. Anyway what is this, a French lesson? Thank you very much, madame. I'm sorry I've disturbed you. Merci, madame. Ah-ah, oh, Inspector? This is terribly exciting and really rather juicy. It isn't secret, is it? I mean I can tell my friend, Mrs. Stanton. I think she might be very interested. Yes, Louise? Oui. They've just been to see me and they came here. I told you not to go up there. I knew it would start something. Well, it's done now. Well, what did you say, what happened? I denied it. Covered as best I could. I'm sure he suspects something. I know it. Did he give you that tape recorder business? Yes. - Were you talking to Louise? - Mm-hmm. Oh, what's gonna happen when she gets back? She will find her gun gone. The house full of police asking questions. She's bound to put two and two together. I know. I told her we were going on a trip. She could stay at her brother's in Marseilles. Well, you're keeping your head. Mine, I'm not so sure. They took my passport. No. Yes. It gets worse and worse. If Neil wants to go on a trip... Oh, darling, don't. We'll pull out of this. Let them suspect. They can't prove anything. Not a thing. - Mr. Singer. - Inspector. Sit down, please. Thank you. What's new in the Mark Dominic situation? You're acquainted with a Dr. Stanton? An American psychiatrist living in Cannes? Oh, yes. I've come to know Neil and Kay Stanton quite well. A wonderful couple. But why? Well, he is returning home day after tomorrow and I would like you to ask him to be of service to us. How? In what way? I have just talked with Madame Stanton and I picked up her passport. I'm sure you will officially sanction it. Kay? Kay Stanton? What the devil could she have to do with this? Let me inform you of my progress. We have been watching that road to Vallauris near the shrine and this morning... - Hello, sweetheart. - Darling. - Hello, Timmy, how are you Son? - Hi, Dad. They called me from Dublin. Want me to come over to Trinity and give a week's seminar there. - You know what I told them? - What? Gotta get back home, my private practice. Very special patient. Boy, I never thought that plane will get here. What a headwind. I almost got out and pushed. Pushed, Daddy. What are we stopping here for? We have to get Timmy back to school. It's terribly late, as it is. A few more minutes won't hurt. First things first. Everybody out. Surprise. Ah, Dr. Stanton Neil Stanton, did you get my letter? Oh, yes, Dr. Stanton, everything is in order. Your schedule and your itinerary your accommodation and the full amount. Selling date a week from today. Wonderful. Oh, Daddy, a trip on a boat. Yes. On this beautiful boat, right there. Oh, boy. Look, Daddy, it's got two swimming pools. You think that will be enough? See, darling, we'll be in Rome on the 15th a week later Athens around the Aegean and back for the end of Timmy's vacation. Now did I come through or didn't I? But, Neil, I... Your vaccination is in order. Oh, yes. You'll mail us a check, Dr. Stanton? - Sure thing. - And I'll need your passports. Well, I'll bring them when I pick up the tickets. - Thank you, Dr. Stanton. - Thank you, sir. Now, is that service, madame? But, Neil, it's so expensive. Don't you think we should wait? For what? What's holding us, are we in jail or something? Jail. Oh, Daddy. Boy, is it good to be home. Hey, Louise! Ma belle reve! - Louise isn't back yet. - No? She asked for another week and I gave it to her. Oh, that suits me. Especially right now. Oh, Neil. - I love you. - Good. You know, you were a little uppity when I talked to you in London. You scared me. Only you.. Forever. Hello. Oh, hi, Bob, how are you? But... but look, friend, I just got in the house, can't you make it la... Really? That important? Well, okay, I'll be there. Alright. See you. Bob Singer, he want's me at the consulate right away. I don't know what, but he said it was important. Oh, darling, I know. I'll make it as fast as I can. How lovely can a girl get? Neil. What honey? Nothing. Yes, it is most gracious of you and Monsieur Singer to help us out. Now, this is where he was found. The shrine. The ditch. I thought it best that you familiarize yourself with the setting. Outside of the voice of the unknown woman on the telephone this is the only evidence we have. Ah, what a charming house, Dr. Stanton you must be very happy here. Kay. Kay, darling! I'm up here. Can you come down? We have guests. Well... one moment. Get you a drink, Inspector? No, thank you. Never on duty. Dr. Stanton, that paper explaining the theory you spoke of, could you show it to me? Well, sure, it's in the study here. - Ah, excuse us, please. - Certainly. Here you are. Mrs. Stanton, I'm Mark Dominic. Oh, yes, darling. Ensign Dominic. He has a problem which Inspector DeFargo has asked me to help him with. Inspector, my wife. A great pleasure, madame. How do you do? Neil, don't you think you could excuse yourself and get out of those travelling clothes? You haven't had a chance to change. You know, I'd like that. You don't mind if I quick change and shower, do you? Please, go ahead. Then we'll get back to more questions, Mark. I think we might be able to open something up. Fine. I was roped into this by Singer. That young officer was found shot in a ditch a while back. They thought he was dead at first. They transfused him at the hospital and he got off lucky. The bullet just whizzed around his chest well, missing heart and lungs and ended up right back here. What do they want you to do? Try and bring back his memory. His mind seems to have a complete blank prior to his being shot. Possibly from a heavy bruise in the back of his head. Either where he was struck or had fallen. He tells us that he remembers his first shore leave setting up his sketch equipment near the pier and then nothing until he came to in the hospital. How is that possible? Why that's not an unusual reaction after a brain concussion. It happens quite often in automobile accidents for instance. Retrograde amnesia, we call it. Inspector, see you a minute. What about that little boy, Timmy? He could easily have been around and would recognize him. I will not involve a child in what could be a tragedy. Maybe as a last resort, but we are progressing well. You're the skipper. Come along, Mark. Hey. Boule. You have played it? - Here perhaps? - No. No. It's just that... I don't know. Some other place, no doubt. Come on. Who is it? Inspector DeFargo, madame. Who? Inspector DeFargo, madame. Oh, come in, Inspector, the door isn't locked. Will you be patient with me for just one minute, Inspector. If I break the rhythm, there will be a complete collapse. If you want to lead a full and active life you must as the boys scouts say, "Be... prepared.” Madame, please, allow me to present Ensign Mark Dominic. How do you do. How do you do. I thought you might have met before... one of your parties? You recognize Madame Fields? This room? - No, doesn't seem... - Oh, no! No, I, I certainly would have remembered him. Wait, is he the one you were... Yes, madame. I am sorry to have disturbed you. - Come along, Mark. - Very nice meeting you. Yes. Why did you go to visit Mrs. Fields? Why I have talked with Madame Fields before. I thought he might have attended one of her functions, but nothing. Well, good try. Come along, Mark. We'll carry on in the study, darling. Please, don't let me stop your game. This is all just like Houdini. And that DeFargo character bringing Neil in like this. He's diabolical. There's only one good thing about it. Mark is still alive. I know I should care about myself, but I... I have to care about Neil and me. And Timmy. Do you think Mark's pretending? Realizing the situation and being decent about it? I'm sure not. Besides Neil could spot it in a minute. What if Neil does bring him out of it? I just don't know. Mark, do you usually sketch or paint when you're ashore? Oh, yes. Why did you do nothing during your stay here? The reports from the carrier said there was nothing in your cabin but a roughed-in-sketch of the bay with an Old Town on the background. And two of your fellow officers, Crawford and Vance saw you working on it near the flower stalls. I... I seem to remember that. But nothing more. With your interest in architecture I mean, the old hilltop towns around here offer a wonderful material. You must have visited them. I, I remember planning on it. But... that's all. Madame Stanton. Could I have a glass of water, please? Certainly. Ah, the housewife and her eternal shopping duties. You are not thinking we are staying for dinner, I hope? No. An interesting case your husband has taken on. - No? - A very. When you planned on visiting these towns had you read about them? Did you know their names? - I knew... - Now, wait a minute. That's the Square at Mougins. And this is St. Paul-de-Vence. Naturally the art gallery there. - You know those names? - Yes. Well, you've been there. But, how could I draw them when I don't remember being there. It's planted in your subconscious. You keep going, boy. Anything. We may be on to something. Inspector, look at this. Fascinating. Look, doctor, the woman's head in the foreground here. A handsome young sailor on shore leave, hmm? One thing and an oblivious one I think we have touched on only lightly. The little matter of sex. - Mark! - Yes, sir. Mark, this woman's head here does that mean anything? Wasn't there any girl? It seems as though. I keep trying to... But when it isn't a blank, it's just all confused. Got to shove off, doctor, they want him back at the hospital by three. - Come along, Ensign. - Yes, sir. Well, we've gotten some place. Kay. - Yes, darling. - Mr. Dominic is leaving, dear. - Now, about tomorrow. - Goodbye, Mrs. Stanton. - Very nice to have met you. - Goodbye. Tomorrow we drive you up to Mougins and all the rest. I think we might get somewhere. Doctor, it seems ashamed to keep you from your charming wife. After your having been away. Perhaps Madame Stanton would care to go with us tomorrow? Thank you, but I'm sorry Mrs. Fields and I are playing Bridge tomorrow. It is our loss, madame. AU revoir. Now, don't scatter your thoughts. Only the things that you and I have talked about already. Now, tomorrow we'll go up and see these places... Now, this theory of yours, the "triviality of association." How does it apply? Some triviality he might have seen when he was here could register and start him remembering. That little donkey cart. That broken shutter up at the window. Even a phrase or remark he might have heard. A remark from someone he has known. Not necessarily. Anybody. Does this place seem familiar at all? It seems. But I don't... Every afternoon just as the sun goes down they fly out to say goodbye to the day. Goodbye to the day. You remembered something, Mark? Yes, vaguely, for a moment. You asked me about it yesterday. - There was a girl. - You were with her, here? It could be, the doves flying up like that. What type of a girl was she? Surely not some midinette or some little Poule? Not here? Oh, no. She was very lovely. Very beautiful. Everything satisfactory, monsieur? Yes, thank you. Ah, look we have a small wager. Have you ever seen this gentleman before? Recently as a guest here perhaps? I'm sorry, monsieur. It's impossible to say. We have so many American naval officers. Thank you. Look, Doctor, could we return to your house and possibly prevail upon your gracious wife to ask us for dinner. I should be very grateful if you could continue to question your patient until he leaves on the plane. A good idea. Let me telephone Mrs. Stanton. Getting a little closer, eh, Mark? ...I hope so. But, Neil, with Louise away and all... Well, it'll have to be pot-luck. I see. Alright, dear. Hmm. Bye, darling. They're coming back here for dinner. Until he leaves for his plane. Neil says they're making progress. You'll stay won't you? Oh, now, look, darling, you've been doing fine all by yourself. But I'm shaking now at the very thought of that DeFargo man he's a cobra. I'm terrified I'll say something or do something that... Wait, what about Timmy? He'll be home, won't he? Yes. I know. I know. Hmm. Looks like we're in for another mistral. - Oh, that door. - I'll close it. Thank you, Inspector. Thank you. Ah, there she is. Martini, darling? - No, thanks. - Really? - Just don't feel like one. - Good evening, Mrs. Stanton. It's nice of you to invite me to dinner. You're quite welcome. - Good evening. - Good evening. Oh, honey, what about Timmy? Shouldn't one of us go fetch him? He's staying at the Dubois for the night. She's taking Pierre and him to the movies. Oh, well, I'll call him later and say goodnight. I'm sorry, you missed him, Mark. He's a wonderful kid. Crazy about the Navy, by the way. - Good for him. - Doctor. May I use your phone? Certainly. Ah, this storm coming up. Mistrals they call 'em. They get pretty wild. It's possible you could have experienced one. It's possible. I might have. Madame Stanton, I regret I cannot stay for dinner. Some urgent business had arisen. The police car is on its way so to save time I shall start walking and meet it en-route. I'm disappointed. Then I am flattered, madame. You are taking Mark to the airport? Yes, Mrs. Stanton and I. I arranged it with Hendricks. Well, I wish you bon voyage, Mark. Thank you, sir, and thank you for your interest. I am sorry we could not have been more successful, but perhaps something will reveal itself between now and the plane. More about the mysterious lady, Could be. Anyhow I'll compile my report and, uh, give it to Hendricks. Clever fellow. Oh, I didn't tell you, Kay. It hasn't been a total loss we did discover that Mark here had a romance. Tell me, Mark, if it wasn't just a pick-up some little Poule as DeFargo said and she was as lovely as you say... We'll be ready to sit down in a minute. Right. Now... May I say something, Dr. Stanton? What? You have a very beautiful wife. I think so. I think I'd like a smoke. - Have a cigar, Mark? - Oh, no, thank you. It was sure a wonderful dinner. Thanks. Hey, what's this? It's a game, I bought it for Timmy for his birthday. "Blockhead, the new bouncing game" "for kids of all ages." Oh, yes, the boys aboard ship play it a lot. Really? Well, come on, let's try. - Okay. - Sit right over there. It might touch off something. Neil, please put it back. I'm saving it for him. Why? It's not birthday wrapped yet. When the kids are away the grownups can play. Who can tell. This is the sort of thing we often use for, uh, mental therapy. Now, let me see. How does that go? First crash, square. Character. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, let's try. You better start, huh? I think we start with this as a base. Then, build on it. My turn, huh? - There's a piece missing. - Hmm. The small yellow heart-shaped piece. This one. Did you hear that, Kay? You should complain. Ah! Those shutters again. That one's liable to tear itself loose. Take my place, darling, I'll help you with the dishes when we get back from the airport. No, I'll finish clearing the table. We should be leaving shortly by the way! That jammed it good. - My play, huh? - Hmm. Pardon. But when one brings a surprise one does not knock. What's this? How did you happen to... Long as I'm here I want to get my book. What's Timmy doing here? He should be in bed, Inspector. Madame Stanton, please, allow me my little surprise. At Madame Dubois we saw the boys coming back from the cinema and... and as I heard doctor say he wanted to say goodnight to Timmy I took the liberty of driving him over in person. And I will drive him back naturally. I showed him my credentials. You hurry back over there, Timmy. Just came to say goodnight, Mom. Gotta hurry back. Goodnight, Daddy. Goodnight, Son. But, Timmy, you haven't spoken to your father and mother's guest. A real American Navy Officer. Ensign Dominic. Oh, hi, sailor sir. Hi, boy. Come on, please, mister. Madame Dubois'|| get mad. I congratulate you on a fine son, madame. Again, bon soir. Well, that was a silly thing for him to do. I think he just meant to be nice. Isn't it time for us to go, Neil? Yeah, I guess it is at that. It'll be cold out, Mark. I've got an extra coat upstairs. Thank you. I forgot something. I didn't tell you about Julius. He got away. Pierre claimed he bit him and let him go. Goodnight, sailor sir. Goodnight, Mom. No, escaped. Pierre was holding him and, uh, he decided to bite so, Pierre dropped him and he got away. Lucky Julius. Kay... No, Mark... What's wrong, Mark? Nothing. I just felt dizzy for a second. I thought you might have remembered something. No. No. You better go. Are you sure you want to come along? - Of course. - Very well. - There you are, Mark. - Thank you. Well, the storm doesn't seem to have grounded you. No. You could probably use some reading material, Mark. - How about a mystery? - Why, I... I'll pick up a couple. You know, I remember now, don't you? Yes. I was a fool to put you through all this. But I'll never forget you, Kay. We were both very foolish, Mark. But it was my fault. You'll forget. You'll find your girl. I wonder about that. Having known you. Have a good life, Mark. Good evening. Stop by and say... I'm stunningly aware of that. So, I said to myself, "DeFargo has failed." But then, little Timmy, on the way back to Madame Dubois tells me of his admiration for you, Mark. And how you stopped at the house that first day. Out of the mouths of babes, n'est pas, madame. Inspector DeFargo, I beg of you, don't bring a child... The details would be interesting to pursue, but if the parties involved do not seem to wish it why should the State? The case is closed, madame. Although you, perhaps might have further difficulties. My regards to your talented husband. Your passport. To you both, bon soir. It's ten francs, fifty centimes, monsieur. Thank you. You want a bag? No, thank you. Just a moment... That, uh, heart-shaped block isn't that from a set of Blockhead? Yes. I sold a set to an American Navy Officer some time ago. It was missing. But I thought if I saw him again... Tell me, was it by any chance that young officer sitting over there? By the pillar? Talking with the lady in the beige coat? - Yes. - Thank you. Attention please. Passengers flying to Paris and New York flight Caravelle... Here you are. That's your plane. Thanks so much, Dr. Stanton. Well, I'm, I'm sorry for... for all the... You better get aboard, Mark. Yes, sir. Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mrs. Stanton. Goodbye. Well, he's on his way. - Nice young fellow. - Yes. I think I'd like to stop off for a night cap. Allard's, huh? Alright. Ah, Madame Stanton. Dr. Stanton. Good evening. Your favorite table. Um, Vermouth Cassis. Kay. The same, I guess. Lovely piece, isn't it? Yes. Mark Dominic reacted very strongly to that tune when they started to play it this afternoon up at the Colombe d'or. Yes, Kay. Neil... you know, don't you? Yes. Oh, Neil. What have I done to you? To us. To what we have. Well, perhaps I haven't been so smart either. Like that game. I was the missing heart-shaped piece. I wasn't around when I was needed. - Kay. - Yes? Do you still love me? Oh, Neil. Let's go home. Hey, hon-bun, what's wrong? I'm not that late, am I? No, darling, you're just in time. Just to see how beautiful the world is when it wants to be. Isn't it though? Isn't it?
