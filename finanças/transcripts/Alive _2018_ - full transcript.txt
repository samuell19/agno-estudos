We got an officer down. Officer down. We need medical right away. - Fuck you. - No! Very strong. So impressed, the way you crawled down that hall. Just breathe, nice and easy. Now, I know it's painful, but you did rupture several stitches when you fell off the gurney. I knew you were a fighter when I found you. You just keep fighting. Now, bear with me a moment. I know this... I know it hurts... ...but pain means you're alive. Trust me. Hello. How are you today? Can you say anything? Hmm? You're getting better every day. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to have to tend to the young lady for a moment, and then we'll talk. All right? Here we are. Lovely. Right. Now then, let's see what we have here. I think a little rehab might be in order today, don't you think? Can you try to move this a little bit? Huh? Just small movements, nothing big. Here we go. Oh, good, that's good. Like I said, small, simple movements. Pain is a good thing, it means you're healing, yes? Try again. That's right. Come on. Come on. Now. Look... I must have misjudged your progress. My mistake. Right. Don't panic. I'm just tucking you in. Can't have these stitches opening up again, can we? Hmm? Right. Don't go away, I'll be right back. I think you're taking rehab into your own hands now, aren't you? I suppose I should be mad, but I'm not mad at you. Sorry about this. Got to get you better, my boy. I'll fucking cut his throat open, if that's what it comes to. Hello? Don't hurt yourself. You've been out for days. I need someone to talk to. How are you feeling? Can you talk? Okay, I'll ask you questions, and you nod or shake your head to answer, okay? Do you know where we are? What do you think of our caretaker? That's a hard question to answer, isn't it? Do you like him? He keeps telling me that he saved us. Do you know what happened to us? Do you know who I am? No. Are you lucky enough to know who you are? I can see you have no... No idea what our connection might be. Strangers? Brother, sister? Husband, wife? Do you know, I wish I recognized you. You're handsome. I would like to think that I'd remember that. How do I look? I don't know why it matters, but it does. Is it bad? Am I just... Fuck. Oh? Oh. Hello, sunshine. She's coming along. You're both coming along. Yes, it's a miracle, a real miracle, eh? They say cleanliness is next to godliness, eh? Of course, if you go by that saying, well, judging by the appearances here, I'm a complete and utter bloody atheist, aren't I? Eh? Yeah, but to be sure, it's hard for a man my age. Very hard. But of course, now that I have company, well, I have to keep up my appearances, mustn't I? Oh, dear. What's that? Let's take a look at that. Huh? Oh. dear, oh, dear. I'm afraid I'm going to have to go in. Otherwise you're going to risk a bacterial infection, my friend. And we can't have that, can we? Eh? Breathe in. No, no, come on. I know, it's all right, it's all right. You're going to have to go down. I'm afraid I can't have you awake. Breathe in. Breathe in. Breathe in. ♪ Good morning ♪ ♪ Good morning ♪ Hello, Angel Eyes. Time for some food, perhaps. I know it's not gourmet, but this is my own special recipe. It's a mixture of some homegrown herbs from the garden, vegetables and some grain. It's everything you need in order to heal, so who's first? Hmm? Huh? You're not even going to try? You must be hungry. You don't want to try? Huh? Come on. Mmm. Come on. Come on, take a mouthful. Eat it. Stick it in your mouth. I think... I think I could try. Wonderful. Let's give you a little taste. Ready? Here we go, a little spoonful, yes. That is so bitter. That's the goldenseal root. You see, that happens to fight infection and muscle spasms. I mean, cocktails of drugs these days, everybody wants to take all of these drugs just for simple little aches and pains. But I've got to tell you, the earth, the earth is the answer. It has every single thing we need. This is a licorice root. And it was invented as far back as 1750 before Christ. It is known for its rejuvenative properties, and it's 50 times sweeter than processed sugar. Are you ready? It's kind of amazing. See? Huh? I'm so glad you like it. You do like it? - It's better. - It is, isn't it? I mean, look at me. Fuckin' I'll eat it. Mmm. Mmm. But I'm gonna let you carry on eating. I'm going to try to feed this monster over here, all right? Let's get you out of these straps, back into the wild. - There we go. Can you grab that? - Mmm. Mmm. Excellent. Now you. Right. Come on. Put it in your mouth. Open up and put it in your mouth. Open up and put it in your mouth. You've got to eat, okay? You've got to eat. That's right, come on, open up. You've got to eat. Come on, stick it in your mouth, stick it in your mouth. That's right, come one, you're gonna do it. Come on. Open up. Don't you behave like that! Come on. Come on. Come on. Yes! Yes! - Oh, thank God. - Don't. It's okay. It's okay. Ah, you're all right. Come back. Come on. Come with me. Oh! This is the second time I've had to save you, my little angel. Come on. Let's get you back into bed. I, uh... I'm gonna let you pull yourself together, and I'm going to go and prepare for the day's events. What do you have planned? What is this place? Don't tell me you've never been in a hospital. Not like this one. First step is always the hardest. Come on. Up on your feet. Are you sure we're ready for this? Yes, yes. Come on. Up, up, come on. That's it. Up. That's it. Come on. Come on, little baby steps. There we go. Now we're moving. A little bit of physical therapy today. Take a seat. Over here. - This arm... - I can't, I can't, I can't. ...in there. Come on. Up. Up. This one in there. That's good. This is all about finding your core. That's good. Simple movements. Now you. We're going to build entire strength from resistance. So we're going to move slowly in... Oh, see what I mean? Is that choking you? You've got to push out, haven't you? Push out. I'm helping you. Push out. Breathe out. That's it, very good. And in. Come on now, you can do a little better than that, can't you? You're a big, strong lad. And out. Very good. I'm helping you here, but this is mostly you. And back in. And out. Out, I'm helping you here. In. And out. Very good. Now back in. It's too... It's too much for him. A little faster now. That's it, and out, and in. - And out, and in. - Please, stop! - Out. - It's too much for him. Quiet. Faster. In. Out. Faster! Faster! Faster! It's too much! It's too much! I won't lie to you, I'm very disappointed. You know, you have to put a little effort in, otherwise you're not going to get better. All right? So... We'll try it again tomorrow. Here we are. Hmm? I think this might be my favorite place on Earth. It's always nice to get outside. I'm so happy to share it with you. Whoa! Don't mind him. He's harmless. Morning. Hello. Sleeping Beauty. Hello. Hello. I want to welcome you to my own little piece of paradise. Isn't it beautiful? It's lovely. Yes. And you? Huh? It certainly helps me feel better. I don't think it's just the placebo effect. The gym just simply isn't as effective as a good old-fashioned walk in the wilderness. Take, for example, every single one of these plants right here. They have various properties, which can either heal or perhaps harm. Would now be a good time to talk about how you found us? Yes. Why not? What do you remember? When I was choking, an image came to me. I was attacked. Wow. A man in a mask. And he... Well, I... Was that... Was that what? Me? For God's sake, I'm a little bit old, don't you think, to be creeping about? Hmm? Wasn't you, was it, young man? Well, I'm not familiar with what happened before I found you. I simply came across you well after that. Is there anything else you can recall? No. You know, I'd love it if you would just think of this place as home. That is very nice of you. But I think we'd like to go to our real homes one day. And where is that? Well, I don't know exactly. Not yet, anyway. And how about you, young man? Where are you from? It's a big world out there. Very big world. Where should we begin? Maybe you could tell us about how you found us. Maybe... Maybe then we could start piecing it together. Well, I don't know how you came to be in such a state where I found you. I just know that you're lucky I came across you when I did. Much longer, I doubt you'd even be here today. Did we have any ID on us? No. None whatsoever. As I said, I wasn't there for the how or the why, I simply showed up for the what to do now. Well, is there someone we could call? No, I'm afraid not. I embrace my solitude. I don't use phones here. I... Well, we would like to leave. Soon. People have got to be looking for us. What makes you say that? But that's what people do when you disappear, they call the police, they search for you. So I'm a criminal now? No. I'm hiding you. That's not what I meant, it's just... Did you know that if you allow one section of a plant to wither, it can kill the rest of the plant? You've got to cut out the rotten part, otherwise the rest of it will wither and fester and die away. Stop, please, no. Stop what? Stop what? Stop what? Doesn't this place... Doesn't this place feel like home to you? I really want it to feel like home. Yes. Home. Yes. This is home. Home. Thank you. Moving on. What about you? Is this home? Don't make me wait for my answer, just answer. Just say it. Say what... I mean, he should say what it is on his mind, don't you think? Look at the way he's looking at me. Well, I think somebody wants to join me in cutting out the rotten parts, doesn't he? Let's help him out, shall we? So let's give the young fellow the shears he wants. - No, no, no. - Come on. No. No. No. - Come on. - No, okay, stop. - Come on. Come on. - Stop! - Stop. Please, okay, stop! - Wait, wait. He's quit. He's quit. No, stop it. Stop it. It's not me, it's him. No! No! Stop it. No! Stop it. It's him. No, no, stop, stop it. Please, don't. - No. No. - No. Stop it! - Not her. - Stop it. No. - No! No! - Not her! - Stop it! Help! Let me out! - No. - Stop it! - Stop it! Look what he's doing to her. - Stop it! Stop it! - No! No! No, stop it! Help! Stop, somebody help! Help! Stop! Home. What? Home. Ha! He speaks! He finally speaks! This is home. We're family. We've had a very long day. I'm going to prescribe both of you a good night's sleep. Some lovely little flowers here. You'll wake up in the morning, and you'll see these. I'm sorry about today, but it was hardly my fault. You just have to know that I'm really trying to look after you. I'm doing the best I can. So, we're going to get a good night's sleep, and we're going to start all over again in the morning. Good night. Mind the bugs don't bite. If they do, get a shoe, beat them till they're black and blue. You okay? Yeah. I'm fine, I guess. You know he's gonna kill us. But he saved us. Were you not just in the garden? You keep pissing him off. You need to be more agreeable. We're alive because of him. We're alive because of him? He brought me back this morning. Why would he do that, and then want to kill me? Are you fucking serious? I don't know, okay? But I know what I saw, and someone attacked me. Yeah, him. No, it wasn't him. It wasn't me. I never said that. Yeah, well, you're implying it. Have you thought any more about who you might be? No. No, I got nothing. I feel like I have children. I can't see their faces, but... I mean, for all I know, I might just like kids. Someone has got to be looking for us, and until they show, I say that we do our best to make nice. I'm not convinced of that. Well, the alternative is that you keep pissing him off, and how's that going so far? You know, you have a tattoo on your shoulder. What's that from? Shit, look at that. Doesn't ring any bells? Look, I don't need to know who I am to know I'm not supposed to fucking be here. And I'm not staying. How are you gonna get out if you won't even eat? Oh, I'll eat his shitty food. I'll "Yes, sir, no, sir," get my arms and legs working, and then I'm fucking out of here. How? There's two of us, and one of him. You wanna stay here? Fine. One day you'll wake up, and I'll be gone. You coming? Yeah, you're coming. ♪ Good morning, good morning Good morning ♪ Yes, yes, it appears that I have developed a rather thin skin after all of these years of being around by myself. Ah! Uh, we... No. These shots can fix anything. Believe me. I know. Good girl. Likewise for the young gentleman. Everything we need for the day. Earth has blessed us with all of these beautiful, miraculous things. Life is a blessing. Life is not to be trampled upon. And I... I was just hoping that I could share that with you. And that there would be some measure of respect and admiration for the world, and for... Me. But I find that instead, I am received with cold and calculated silence, and stares, and contempt, and the judgement of my inferiors. All I did was clothe you and feed you. In fact, you didn't eat your breakfast yesterday, did you? Hmm? Eat your breakfast. And as for you, I have made up a special dish. Now dig in. Good boy. Another one. Open wide. That's it. And another. Now then. - How is it? - It's delicious. Is that so? On a scale from 1 to 10? Oh! Ha-ha! I see the seeds are having their effect. What are you doing to him? A simple, mild paralytic, just to ensure that he eats exactly as much as I want him to eat. You didn't need to do this. He wanted to eat. he was going to eat. We talked about it. Oh, you talked about it, did you? You talked about it. Well, let's put a little more food in that very active mouth of yours. That's right. Somebody's got a big appetite today, haven't they? That's right. Eat. A little more eating and a little less talking. The sooner you get the blood pumping, the faster the toxin will move through your system. Just keep moving, and you'll be fine. Right. And now you. You think you're going to be able to stand by yourself? Oh, a brave new world. There we go. Wonderful. That's it. That's excellent. Let's just get you undressed, shall we?

Is he all right? Shh! You know, I was a lonely child. My father was a doctor. He was a brain surgeon. The first brain surgeon who was able to do a brain transplant on a chimpanzee. He was a brilliant man. A genius, really. Oh, look at that. I think he's in trouble. I think we need to check on him. When he goes silent, then he's in trouble. Until then, just calm down. Everything's all right. We're making you nice and clean. Fresh as a daisy. Hey. What's the matter? What's the matter? I'll go get a towel. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. You're right. We gotta get out of here. He's gonna kill one of us. Yeah, me. All right, let's go. What the fuck is this? You can run. You can run like rats in a maze, but there is no exit from here.

You know who said that? Bakunin, a great Russian philosopher. Great Russian philosopher! And I have come to the conclusion that there's something wrong with that fellow there in his head. So, we are going to change things. I mean, I've tried my hardest to make him feel at home. He just won't come to terms with it, you understand? He just can't come to terms. Just, not like you, you've come to terms with it all. You understand that there's no leaving this place unless I initiate it. Isn't that correct? You're gonna have to tell me something. You're gonna have to talk to me, you're gonna have to... I mean, I have to trust you. I have to know this unholy union is over. You're gonna have to talk to me. Tell me what he does when I leave the room, for example, and I turn out the lights. What happens at that point? Huh? Tell me. Now! When I turn out the light, what does he say to you? Honestly. He plots. He schemes against you. And you, what do you do? What do you do? I've listened. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Right. You're gonna help me now, okay? You're gonna help me to decide what we're gonna do to him, okay? I could blind him. Yes? We'll do that? What do you think? Huh? Castration? I can also, uh... I could kill him. Tell me what you want! Huh? How about I just shut him up? - Just shut him up. - Huh? Just shut him up. And you will never listen to any of his little plots again? No. No. Are you going to go into the nursery ever again? I will not. Aye, say it, "I will not," what? I will not go into the nursery again. Are you gonna listen to me? Are you gonna tell me everything that's in that little head of yours? Yes. Say it! I have a daughter. Please, help me find my little girl. Yes, of course. First of all, I'm going to give you something that has passed down through my family for generations and generations. And they belong to someone very special to me. This is a little reward of your loyalty to me. There you go. What do you say? Thank you.

We'll be all right, we'll be okay. Oh, we'll be all right, we'll be okay. We'll be all right, we'll be okay. We'll be all right, we'll be okay. We'll be all right, we'll be okay. Ta-da! Look at him. He's like a nice little quiet house-trained puppy now, isn't he? And so we learned today that actions have consequences. Repeat after me. Actions have consequences. He speaks, you listen, I act. He spoke, and I listened. No more. We are one, you and I. Look at those little beautiful earrings you've got now. - They're beautiful. Give me a smile. - Mmm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm. I need a little advice from you. See, I'm not sure his mouth is good enough. Look at his legs. Look how big and strong they are, like an elk's. He can run. Do you think the big toe will be enough? Yes. Yes, I think so, too. Stop struggling. I'd hate to take more than is necessary. Die, you fuck! So sorry. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I'm so... I'm so sorry. Nice earrings. Fuck! Fuck. Hey. Wait, wait. Hey. Hey. Come here. Go. You see that? What the fuck? It smells so bad. What is that? Hold on. Hold on to the rail. Here, here. Oh, my God. Dropped the damn axe. Fuck it, let's get out of here. Come on! Easy. What the fuck? Well done. It seems I have two able bodies on my hands. You're survivors. I told you as much, and now you've proved me right. So why don't we just sit down like adults, - and I'll explain everything. - Move. No, no, no, no, no. You don't understand, the family that you're hoping to find is right here. We're not interested. We don't need him. We'll find you a new companion, my dear. Last chance? Fuck you. You will not like how this goes if I have to come find you. Here we go. Come on. Quick, get up here. Okay. Trust me, all right? Trust me. What's wrong? I don't know. Oh, my God. Oh! Hey. It's okay. Relax, he's gone. Okay? He's gone. Hey. Look at me, look at me. You're all right, okay? Fuck. Oh, hey, hey, hey. Oh, hey, hey, this one's gonna stop. Hey! - Hey! - We need your help. Hey. Holy shit! Wait! Wait! Fuck! Come on! Fuck! Why wouldn't they stop? 'Cause look at us. Do you remember anything yet? Look, I know you do. I can see it in your eyes. Why aren't you telling me? I just... I just hope I'm not the guy I think I am. Come on. Hey. Thank God. Hey, can you just take us to the nearest town? Shit. No! Let her go! Go, go, go. Run! Hey. Get away from us. You've had your fun for now. It's time for us to go home, and I'll look after you. You can come home now, or you can die. Fuck off! I'd rather die. No! Okay. You're gonna be okay, you're gonna be okay. You know, those earrings, they meant a lot to me. Help me. Help me. - Okay. - Why do you always choose him? Please. You have to help him. Please help him. Please, please, please help him, please. You have to help him. Please help him! You have to help him! You can to do something! Please, give him one of those shots. You have to help him. Oh. Please help him, please. Just give him one of those shots. For him, just for him. If only you felt that way about me. Hey! You want these? Those have great sentimental value. Catch. No! No! Hey. It's okay. He's gone. Okay, we need to get you some help. - Okay? - All right. Okay. Okay, ready? Okay. - Oh, no, no, no, no. - Oh, fuck! Okay, stay with me. It's okay. Someone help us! Please! Somebody help us! Hey. Hey. Hey. I'm sorry. I am. I'm sorry I ever brought us here. Stop it. - If I did anything... - Stop. Whatever I was before, all right? Whatever I did. That doesn't matter anymore, okay? Our lives start now. Okay? What's your name? What? Remember your name. I don't know my name. You can call me Joe. Joe? Yeah. That's a nice name. What do I call you? What do I call you? Uh... You can call me... Elizabeth. Yeah. - Elizabeth. - Yeah. Okay, Joe. Joe, I'm Elizabeth. And we're gonna call each other that for a long time, okay? Okay? I don't know, that's so regal. Okay. Get up, get up. We're gonna get you up. Okay. Okay, okay. Eeny, meeny, miny, mo... Where are we? At a real hospital, with real doctors and nurses. We made it? I told you we'd make it. Good morning, Doctor. Has anyone notified our family? I think it would be better if you spoke to the detective about that. Morning. How's everyone feeling? Fine. Great. Everything okay? While you've been recovering, we have run your fingerprints and DNA. I'd like to speak to you both separately. Why can't we be doing this together? There seems to be a problem with your fingerprints. They don't match. They don't match? What does that mean? Mom? You're not supposed to come in here. Stop it, okay. Get your hands off of her. Orderly. It can't be. Is that her? That's her daughter. Let's go, come on. Hey! Stop it. Get your hands off of her. Stop. Get your hands off of her! What's going on here? What? I didn't think this was possible. Your fingerprints, they don't match. You fucking said that. What does that mean? - It's going to be all right, sweetie, I'm home. - No. It looks like you, but it can't be you. - You're not my mom. - I am your mother. The fingerprints on your right hand match Allan Ray, former death-row inmate. The prints on your left match Billy Dolan, highly decorated cop killed on duty. It is me, of course it's me. Who else could it be? You're my daughter. I am your mother. I sat next to your bed every night. I know the attack was horrible, okay? But I am better now. What attack? I helped take care of you when you were sick. Sick? Doctor, tell her about the burglar. The woman that lived in that apartment had no children. But... She... She's my daughter. Sense memory. Muscle memory. Trauma. Those things can leave an imprint on the body. What? I remember. I was only four years old. I watched you die. They're not victims, they're bodies. Just bodies. They were already dead. He wasn't killing anyone. He was bringing them back to life. He was sewing people together, and bringing them back to life. But I'm not familiar with what happened before I found you, I just know that you're lucky I came across you when I did. Much longer, I doubt you would even be here today. The family that you're hoping to find is right here. Trust me. Pain means you're alive. It was home. No, no, no! What are they doing? Okay. Wait. Okay, I want you to stay calm. What are you doing? What are you... Get off her! What are they doing? No, no, no, no! Try to remain calm. Try to be calm. Just get off. Fuck! No, no. Get off me! Wait. Fuck! He was right. Fuck, no! Where are you taking us? Where the fuck are you taking us? You have no right. Let us go. Elizabeth. Elizabeth, listen, I'm right here. It's all right, I'm right here. Come on, let me fucking go! Be careful. The agency needs her for testing. No! No! No! What the hell? Whose idea of a sick joke is this, huh? It's not funny! Hey, man. I seem to have bumped my head. Oh...
