♪♪ Newscast: Headlines, the trial in suburban simi valley is like no other in Los Angeles history... Spanish language newscast: Theodore briseno y Laurence Powell... ( Continues in Spanish ) Newscast: The jury in the Rodney king police beating trail has just reached verdicts in all but one of the charges against the four LAPD officers in that case. They've deliberated three days now on just that one count. The trial itself took 35 days and the jury was in the 7th day of deliberation when they announced that they did reach a verdict on all but one of those counts. I believe that Brian Jenkins is ready for US. Brian has covered this trial right from the very beginning, so let's hear Brian live now at the courthouse as he finds out exactly what's happening. Brian? Jenkins: Well, Patty, it's a state of fear... Uh, state of fearfulness just waiting for this decision to come down. The court's been adjourned for seven days of deliberations. The last three we are told have been devoted to just one of the five counts against the four officers. There are people outside, court watching... How's school, Jeffrey? It's fine. Including opening and closing statements, and they of course have opinions of their own. There has been a beefed-up security here everyone's in a state of breathless anticipation. Pat? I got pulled over... ..has declared as to that count... ( Door buzzer ) Man on security camera: Every time I come up in here you be following a nigga around like we stealin' and shit.

I get a check tomorrow, mama-San. Tell Mr. Lee I said it's okay for small bottle. I'll take care of it tomorrow, mama-San. Ha ha ha ha! I'm sick of the way you let these fools walk all over US. This is the toehold on our dream, Jeffrey. This is not a dream. It's a nightmare. We wanted so many things for you, Jeffrey. Things that your father and I could never possibly have. It's just... He never stands up to 'em. And they're always pushin'. They're always pushin'. It's like we owe 'em something. We don't owe 'em nothin'. It's been handed down for generations. 24 karat, always willing to bend. Mom... Try to bend 14, and it will snap in half because of its rigidity. Your lustrous sheen can sometime be very blinding. What you view as your father's weakness is an illusion. What you don't see is his strength. ( Rap blaring from car ) You need anything else from the store? He loves you, Jeffrey. What's happening, Jeff? Why your mama be like that, nigga? Yo, Yoko Ono-lookin' motherfucker, gonna scratch my face.

And now, looking at rocks and bottles being thrown at another car in an intersection. They're attacking the driver right now, they just broke out the window. Newscopter 13 has been fired upon by people with guns down below, we've seen the muzzle flash and smoke. What we have down here, folks, is a lot of angry people rioting in the street. Here's a live picture. They're now pulling the door off the car, they're cracking the windows, they are in the process of destroying an automobile. People have been injured. The fire department trying to respond here just a short time ago. They came under attack, and they have now pulled off. Jeff. They are literally unable yeah. You gotta take me back. To enter this area. In terms of police presence, there is none. There is no police presence here as of yet. You don't want to come down here. They're attacking everyone that...

Hey, don't be banging on that TV! Your brother gave me that TV. No wonder it's a piece of junk. Damn door still don't work. What's wrong, baby? No luck today? There's nothing out there. No work, nothing. You know, mijo, I have a friend that works at the airport. Maybe if I ask her she can help you, no? The airport won't hire Cisco. We all know why. Computers, mom. You can't get away with nothin' today. Unless you're a cop. ..Definitely gonna change my life, and I gotta find something else to do with it. Ay. He keeps kicking me. I gotta go. I promised Iris I'd meet her by the mall. Sister: Iris, huh? Are you gonna take her to the dance on Friday? I don't know. Maybe. You wearing condoms when you mess with that girl? Cisco, por favor. We're at the table. Mom, I just don't want him to end up like me. What's that supposed to mean? What do you think it means? I can't even afford to buy that kid in your belly a damn baby carriage. Manuelito, mijo, I wish you wouldn't go out tonight. This Rodney king thing is scaring me. Ay, ma, I'm not a little kid. I can take care of myself. Babe. Hmm? I can see. ( Chuckles ) Ay. Cisco, could I borrow the truck to go to the mall? The truck has a flat. You know that. What, the same flat? You've had that flat tire for a week now. That's right, and I'll have it until I can find a job and get some money to get it fixed. You all right, man? Yeah. It's just... You know... Life. Look, I could always quit school and get a job. What? And fuck your life up like I did mine? I just want to help the family, man. You want to help the family? Then you stay in school, and you stay out of trouble. Entiendes? You gotta keep the faith, carnal... Carnalito... And you'll be all right. And in the the meantime, try the bus. You don't want to keep the little lady waiting. ( Exhales ) Hey, baby. Hey, cutie. Guess what. What? I got some crazy news to tell you. What is it? Well, I'm pregnant. Ay! ( Laughing ) I got you! Jesus, Iris, don't do that! I got you! Shit. I'm only playing. That's no way to play. At least I told you I was playing. There's this girl in my science class, she lied and she told her boyfriend she was pregnant just so she could keep the money for the abortion. Damn, that's cold. It may be cold, but she took that money and she bought herself this fresh new dress, you know, for the party at the center next Friday? Well, you know me, I'll be going wearing that same old worn-out dress and my holey panty hose. Yeah, but at least you got a clear conscience. Yeah, a clear conscience and empty pockets. Big fuckin' deal. Damn, Iris, you're so hard sometimes. Ten years from now when I'm walking down these streets I want people to look at me with respect. You mean to tell me you still plan to live in this fucked up neighborhood ten years from now? Yeah, well, where else am I gonna live, eh? I don't know. But man, if I'm still here ten years from now, then I'll know I must have done something wrong. ( Indistinct shouting ) Hey, what's going on over there? ( Burglar alarm blaring ) I don't know. Man: Whoo! Come on. ( Shouting continues ) ( Car revs engine, tires screech ) Hey, that was Carlos. Carlos! Carlos! Over here, homes! What's up, man? What's going on? These people were yelling "Rodney king" over and over again, then the broke into the store, and then they broke into this other store. The people are striking back, carnal. You better come and get some goodies before they're all gone. You better stop this shit before the cops come down here and throw your ass in jail. You ain't seen the TV? Ours is broken. There ain't no cops around here for miles, man. Them poor fools are too scared to come down here. So I'm like, "fuck it, I'm gettin' mine," you know? Carlos, wait! You're not anywhere, okay? The fool's tripping out or something. We gotta stop him. ( Indistinct shouting ) Check it out! It's that new panasonic jamming! Let's get out of here. What the hell are you doing, man? You said your TV was broken, right? Well, here you are, every kind of TV you could possibly want. Fifteen inches ain't big enough? Take twenty-seven! Only thing is I ain't helping you carry that big motherfucker home. We don't need your help because he's not taking anything, okay? He look like he don't need my help ever since he married you! All right, everybody, this is it! Everything must go! We've slashed our prices to the bone, motherfuckers! Our prices are so low we're practically giving it away! Fuck, we are giving it all away! ( People shouting, alarm ringing ) There are gonna be cops here any minute. We better move it. When have you become such a wuss? What?! You're the one who's real bold, doing crazy things with lots of people around. Why are you so scared now? If you think what the cops did to Rodney king was something, you just wait till they come down here and see all the shit that's happening now. They're gonna be stomping in people, including US! They don't give a fuck, Manny. To them we ain't nothing but a bunch of wetbacks and niggers, okay? Yo, let's go! Get in the sneaker store! Don't even think about it. I-I just want to see what's going on. Nothing's gonna happen. What about the cops? What cops? Ain't no goddamn cops. Manny! Oh! My size, too! Are you, crazy, Manny? Now you're gonna be like these other maniacs around here? Get out of my way! Carlos: Hey, homey, you finally figured it out, huh? Took me a little while too, and then I finally realized, shit, man, all my life people been telling me I can't have this and I can't have that. That's right, unless you're paying for it, asshole! What, asshole? You're the ass, Iris. I paid for this. My parents paid for it, too! Take your hands off my shit! Breaking their backs working for whitey! I'm like, fuck it! I'm gettin' mine, man! That's it, I'm outta here. You coming with me, Manny? Hey, man! Get outta here. Shit! Damn! What happened? Manuel, put them back or I'm gonna tell your mother. What are you talking about? It's only a pair of sneakers. Carlos took five of them. Now you're gonna be like Carlos? Well, let me tell you something about Carlos... he's a jerk! Ain't nothin' the matter with Carlos. I never seen Carlos steal nothin' in his whole life. Well, that sure has changed, hasn't it? Come on, Iris, it ain't no big deal. I mean, shit, I could have taken one of those tvs before, and I didn't, right? Oh, yeah! Yeah! Whoo! They broke into the store across the street! Come on! Oh, shit! Thank you, god! I promise I won't take nothin'. ( All whooping it up ) I just want to see what's going on. I just want to be part of the party. ( Alarm blaring ) This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life. When you think about it, it makes a lot of sense. A lot of sense? Please. Yeah. I'm serious, Iris. I mean, how much bullshit do you think people can put up with before they crack? They watch TV. They see whitey with everything. And then they look at their own lives and see that they ain't got shit. Manny, that's bullshit. If that was true, then I'd be stealing too. I'd be grabbing things, taking things that didn't belong to me. But this is a bunch of... Oh, my god. That's beautiful. Why don't you put one on? I can't. Imagine if you went to the dance next Friday wearing one of those. No, I-I can't do that. Mrs. Rodriguez? ( Nervous laughter ) Iris, Manuel. Como estan? Mija, what do you think of this? Well, anything you wear looks good on you, Mrs. Rodriguez. Oh, you're so sweet. Gracias, muchacho, gracias. Come on. Oh, my god. What? I never realized how beautiful you are. You look like you'd be on the cover of a magazine! ( Laughs ) Oui? Yeah! Jesus, look at you! Oh, stop it. I wonder how many girls there are out there like you, girls who just never had the chance to know how beautiful they are? Is this the dress you want? Manny, you promised me you wouldn't take anything else. Me? I'm not takin' it. If you want it, you have to take it yourself. Well... I can't. I can't take it. Hey! Hey! That's mine! That bitch stole my clothes! Holy shit! Who the fuck is that, prince barria? Yo, Manny, check this out. Look what I found. Oh, my god. Ese, get rid of that shit. I ain't keepin' it, dog. I'm gonna sell it on the street tomorrow. Come on. Vamonos. Let's go! I'm Wendy Walsh live in south-central Los Angeles, and as you can see, chaos is rampant here on the streets around the city. Excuse me, young man, what are you doing? Hey hey, america, what's happening! Carlos: Hey hey hey! What's up, america! Yo, check it out! Looks like you're getting something, mijo. Yeah? What program is that? I don't know. It looks like the price is right or something. Oh, my god. Que Paso? Manny: Look at my girlfriend, she got a new dress! And I got some stuff for my family! Carlos: This stuff would have cost thousands if we bought it! Walsh: Are you saying that you stole these items? Carlos: No, no, I wouldn't call it stealing, it's more like creative shopping. Dios mio! Manuel! Ay, dios mio! It's hermano Manuel! ( Continues in Spanish ) This is too much shit to be carrying around, man. Let's take that car right there! Whose car is that? I don't know whose car it was, but it's mine now! Today everything is free! You could get it started without the key? My cousin's an auto mechanic. He taught me all the tricks, homes. You're gonna be so stupid to steal somebody else's car?! If we don't take this car, how are we gonna get this stuff out of here? On a magic carpet? Come on, what are you waiting for? Manny, don't do it. You know it's wrong. What you gonna do, tell his mother? Manny, you gonna let this bitch talk to you like that? I ain't no bitch, faggot! Look at you, all dressed up like a goddamn queen! You deserve to have that dress, but I can't have this car? Someone ripped of my clothes. What am I supposed to do, run around naked? You put it on! You wanted that dress! You deserve to have nice things in life, but I don't deserve shit? All I said is that it's wrong to steal this car. Fuck her, Manny. Give me your stuff. Come on. Oh, shit! It's my brother! Maybe we could use his truck! Hey, bro, what are you doing here? What the fuck are you doing here? You should see all the cool stuff we got for you an alisa. Motherfucker, get your ass in the truck. I'm taking you home. Oh, shit! Fuck! Did you hear what I said? I got you a baby carriage and a tire! Man, I don't care what things you got! Get in the truck! I'm taking you home! Cisco, please, don't diss me in front of my friends, man. What are you, stupid? Fuck your friends! Fuck your friends! Let's see if your friends visit you in fucking prison! None of mine did! You hit me, man. You're a man now, huh? I'll beat your ass just like a man, chavala, the same way they'll beat your ass in the joint, you keep fucking around! Yo, Manny, let's go! There's a cop over there! Oh, shit! They're whipping his ass! Ha ha ha ha! I've never seen anything like this in my entire life. I ain't goin' with you. I'm goin' with my friends! What? Fuck you! I ain't goin' nowhere with you! Hey! Get the fuck out of here! What are you doing? You're stealing a car! I don't care. Get in! Fuck it! Go! Man: Hey! Manny! Hey, that's my fuckin' car! Who the fuck does he think he is?! Fuck him! When he was in fucking jail, I took care of the family! I'm the one who drove his woman to the hospital when she was feeling sick. I'm the one who drove mom to work every day! Fuck him, man! Fuck him! If I were you, I wouldn't let nobody drag me down today. Fuck everybody today, okay? Today is the greatest day of my life. And god bless Rodney king! God bless that motherfucker! We're going over right now to another mall 'cause the night ain't over, ese! It's still young! Let's go! ( Helicopter hovering ) We gotta get more stuff! Fuck yeah! Iris: You're fucking hurting me, you asshole! Shit! Fuck! Carlos: Get off of her! What are you doing? Yo, get off of her! ( Iris screaming ) Get the fuck out of here, motherfucker! Man: He's got a gun! Get the fuck out of here! Motherfuckers! Goddamnit, Iris, I thought we told you to watch the goddamn car! Fuck you, Carlos! They attacked me, you idiot! You're the idiot, you punk bitch! Fuck you, Carlos! Is this who you decide to follow around all night, somebody who ain't got no respect for anybody or anything? You're a bitch! Shut up! Hey, hey, hey. ( All shouting ) All right, but just check her. Take it easy, Iris. It's over. It's over. You're damn rite it's over. Where you going? Away from you! Iris! You made me so ashamed! You're no better than any other boy from the barrio! Yo, forget her! She just lives down the block. She'll be fine, man. Come on. Fuck, man. Hey, I wouldn't let nobody ruin my night tonight, man. Come on we got over today, man. For one day, for one fuckin' day in my whole life, I came out on top, I came out the winner. Me! Carlos Sanchez! You know? You know how my family's gonna freak when they see all the stuff I got them? I'm gonna be a goddamn hero, homes. A hero. And they're gonna love me. For once in my life, I want to know what that feels like. Yeah... I know what you mean. Mr. Lee: You're welcome to any store items. You hungry? To take any store items... Please, don't burn our store. Please take whatever you want. Mrs. Lee: Don't burn down our store. Take what you need. You're welcome to any items. You thirsty? Man: Fuckin' slope. Man: Let's grab some shit from the back. Come on! Our personal things! Please don't! Sony! No motherfuckin' baloney!

Carlos. Bro! Oh, shit, bro! Jeffrey: Dad! Dad! Jeffrey: Dad, please! Come on, open up! Open up! Open up! Daddy! Come on, open up! ( Hissing ) Aaaah! ( Gas line hissing ) ( Coughing ) Oh! No! No!!! ( No audible dialogue ) You know, I'm really getting to hate these gooks. What gooks? These Vietnamese bitches in my aerobics class. Yesterday one of them started giving me shit. She said there was too much "hiyee-impack work." I mean, I could hardly understand what she was saying. They've all got such an attitude. Can't even find a street sign in English on garden grove boulevard anymore. Did you notice that? It's like everything's in Vietnamese. The verdicts come in today. I met this producer yesterday. He wants me to do a workout video. I tell ya, these guys are gonna get crucified. What guys? Powell, koon, briseno, wind. What are you talking about? Rodney king. I am so sick of hearing about that asshole! See, that's just it. Don't you realize what has happened? Don't you realize what this has done to the department, that all it took to bring down the LAPD is one drunken asshole doing 100 mile-an-hour in a 35 mile-an-hour zone? What happened to this country? Where did it go wrong? How did we go from Martin Luther King to Rodney king? Can you tell me that? When are you gonna get some furniture for this place? When are you gonna move in with me? I'm not moving in with you until your divorce is final. And that's final. It should be the end of the month. You can stay here rent-free until then. You know, boomer, I'm not a gypsy, and I don't like to live like one. I don't like camping out. Just look at this place. Does anybody live here? Hello? I want my own home. Is that too much to ask? Maybe you should think about being something other than a cop. Okay, okay. Look, your brother is a successful developer, right? If he can do it, you sure as shit can. I know, I know. Just think about it. Just think about it. Okay, I gotta go. Hi. Hello. Where's Heather? Getting dressed. Want some breakfast? No. The grass needs cutting. Yeah, I know. I've been busy. Yeah. I see evidence of that everywhere I look. Where are the light bulbs? Oh, I moved 'em. But this is the drawer for the light bulbs. This was the drawer for the light bulbs, and now they are over there. I don't think over here is the best place for them. Boomer... If you want to put the brown socks with the brown socks and the black socks with the black socks, be my guest, okay? It's not about socks. TV: The verdicts are expected today in the police beating trial... Oh. That asshole. Today's the day. What do you think is gonna happen? I think they're gonna get nailed to the shithouse door. What do you think is gonna happen? Don't you think those cops went a little bit too far? Hey, come on. They lost it, all right? They stopped being officers of the law and they started being guys. "Guys"? Oh, so, it was a guy thing. Oh, really? Look, they just started wailing on that asshole and they forgot who they were. They forgot what they were there for and that they are professionals. How inconvenient. And look at that, they keep showing this videotape. That's not gonna help anything. That's not doing anybody any good, and you know what? They have no idea. People have no idea what it was like for them out there, because they weren't there. Fuck! Hey, baby. Hi, sweetheart. Hi, daddy. How are you? Ooh! So pretty today. Give me some of that. Ready for school? What were you talking about? Rodney king. The man in the tape who got hit so many times? Yeah. Yeah, Rodney king. Rocket scientist. Baby, do you want grape, strawberry, or peach jam on your toast? What is this, a restaurant? My mother never gave me three choices. Well, boomer, I'm not your mother. And you know what? This is a restaurant. It's my restaurant. And I'm gonna run it the way I want to, okay? Come on, sweetie. Come eat your breakfast. ( Sighs ) Why are you so grouchy? I'm not grouchy. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. ( Sighs ) Okay, you're right. I am grouchy. It's because this guy Rodney king... That was a terrible thing that happened to this police department. It destroyed morale. People have no idea... Emily got a computer for her birthday. Her parents are taking me and Lauren to magic mountain on Saturday. That's great. Do you have a girlfriend, daddy? ( Sighs ) Well, do you? No. There you go. I miss you, daddy. I miss you a lot. Do you ever think you'll come home again? Well... I don't know. Maybe. Bye. Ahem. Hey, amigo. How's it goin'? It's goin'. Dawn, this is my partner boomer, boomer, this is dawn. Boomer? Is that really your name? No, it's just what they call me. Way cool. Yeah, cool. Yeah, that's me. Listen, keep it running, okay? Okay. It was nice meeting you. Yes, it was nice to meet you, too. Wow. Where'd you find her? Redondo beach. She's a professional volleyball player. Professional volleyball? She gets paid to play volleyball? You gonna marry her? Of course. TV: So far the demonstrators have remained calm, do I get to be best man? But simi valley police officers are standing by should any violence occur. Fuck you, Rodney king! Eat shit, motherfucker! Kiss my ass, you lowlife scumbag! That moron's gonna walk away from this thing a friggin' millionaire. And he still won't know which way to wear his hat. I mean, don't you know that? The reason the brothers wear their hats backwards is because there's not a label on the inside that says "this is the front and this is the back." Chas, you're trouble, brother. The only reason Rodney king was hit in the head so many times and didn't sustain any permanent damage is because that was the only part of his body that didn't contain any vital organs. I want to know how one videotape has made this whole department a big fuckin' joke. You can thank Rose bird and her clusterfuckin' liberals for what's happening. Speaking of bird, you know how many times I've been flipped off this week? Yeah, and fuck George holliday and his fucking video camera. Man, the only mistake those cops made was they got caught! No, no, the mistake they made was they lost control of the situation. Those motherfuckers blew it. No, boomer, the mistake they made was, they followed their training. It was like they were taught in the academy... Don't tie up with the suspect. Don't get in close. Use your Baton. "Don't tie up with the suspects." I mean, come on, how many times have you heard that, boomer? That's what they told US, man. The day they took the barham control hold away from US, now, that was the day we started losing control of the streets. And what happens if you don't have enough upper body strength and you can't use your Baton, huh? Yeah, man. I mean, that was Powell's problem, right? He wasn't strong enough to take mandingo out. Yeah, and he wasn't alone either, was he? Well, what they teach you in the academy doesn't always work that way in the jungle. Chas, don't give me that jungle bullshit. They became the fucking jungle. That's the problem. Fuck that shit, man! Have you ever thought about what might happen if they let those cops go? Have you? I mean, has anybody thought about that? That's not gonna happen. But if what if it does, boomer? Huh? I'm just saying what if it does? Then what? Then we take care of business. I don't think so. Any of you guys think so? And you know why, boomer? Hey... you know why? Because we don't have a plan. I mean, do we? What if the station comes under fire from a sniper? Have we been issued any riot gear? Fuck, no! Have we had any special training in the past three months? Fuck, no! Is there a contingency plan in effect? Fuck, no! We're fucked, man! The department's fucked! Everything's... fucked! Hey, come on. We got two minutes to roll call. Let's go. No, I called in sick. What? Yeah, I got stomach cramps, fever, my ears are ringing. You name it, I got it. You don't look sick to me. Actually, I, uh... Forgot my wallet here last night. It's the only reason I'm here today. Look, boomer, if those people out there think we're such a bunch of fuck-ups because of what they saw on the tape, well, then, fuck 'em, man. You know? Fuck 'em. Just gonna take the day off with miss redondo beach and play with her volleyballs. That's bullshit, man. You're a cop. Whether you like it or not, you do have a job to do. You're right, boomer. Yeah. You're absolutely right, I do have a job to do. But unfortunately, not today, because today is for me. I'll see ya. ( Distant siren ) Motherfuckin' bastard! Get out of our neighborhood! TV: Rather heated exchanges between those who have been watching the trial, there are several members of the African-American community who have voiced their displeasure and their wanting for a conviction for all four officers involved. They've been here every day. You've got a lot of people here who are in total support of the police officers. One man delivered a box of donuts to officer Powell as he went inside. Hey, boomer. Cheering him on as he went in, saying that they supported him. It appears that we are going to have a verdict read. There was some concern that the judge would send the jury back in the event that they were deadlocked on one of the counts, but it does not appear that that is the case. Judge weisberg did just that in a previous trial. And here's the reading. Juror: We find the defendant Laurence m. Powell not guilty yes! Yes! Of unlawful assault with a force likely to cause great bodily injury and with a deadly weapon. How about that boomer? Yeah, how about that. All right, LAPD! Yeah! Cop: Justice, finally! Justice. You call that justice? Justice for who? Ain't no goddamn justice. Goddamn rip-off, man. No goddamn justice. That's some bullshit there, that's what that is. It's a damn joke, man! Justice for who? Excuse me. Excuse me. Fuck the LAPD. Hey, I'm an LAPD officer. You don't talk to me like that. You got it bro? I ain't your bro. What? What you gonna do? You gonna beat me down like you did Rodney king? Just watch your mouth, mister. Cop: Forget it, man. These guys are assholes. Forget it? Come on, boomer, get over it. Let's go. Let's get out of here. Fuck 'em, boomer. Fuck you. Let's get out of here. What? You want some of this? All y'all, you can get some of this. Fuck 'em. You know what I'm sayin'? You know what I'm sayin'? Hi. Yeah, you heard what happened? With the verdicts. Yeah, I can't believe it. Where's Heather? She's in her room doing her homework. Good. Keep her in there. Don't go out. I need you to make sure you know where your gun is in case you need to get at it. Keep the television on. What are you talking about? What's the matter? Nothing yet. It's just... You know, some people might not be happy with the way those verdicts came down and you don't know what can happen. Do you think there's gonna be trouble? Maybe, maybe not. Nothing we can't handle. You, uh, you want me to come over? No. I'd rather you didn't. I just want to make sure that you're all right. Boomer... It's over. Why can't you understand that? Yeah. Sure. Tom Bradley on TV: We are determined that the message will go out. Los Angeles will not tolerate rogue cops, will not tolerate improper conduct on the part of any of our police officers. Marching about white supremacy... How can there be peace here? We're just trying to keep the peace, make sure people don't get hurt, that's the only reason we're here. So what we have in essence is four officers who walked out of this court free men, free to continue their lives as they were before, no doubt they'll have some changes they'll have to deal with, but now it falls to the community as to how they react to this. ( Siren blaring ) ( Angry shouting ) Get out the car, motherfucker! ( Shouting continues ) Boomer: All right, get off the car! Get back on the sidewalk! Back the fuck up! Clear the roadway, people! Right now! Back up! Motherfucker! Every one of y'all! ( Shouting continues ) Back off! Officer needs assistance. Dispatcher: 12-0-51, disregard group and do not get involved. Cop: 12-a-1, we have a major 415 group. Situation is critical. Requesting additional units. ( Siren wailing ) Five-oh! Cops! Let's get out of here! Cop: Back, buddy. Back! Hands behind your head! Drop 'em back! Spread your legs! Back the fuck up! He's hurtin' my boy! Let him go! He's just a child! Ma'am, we are arresting this child for vandalism! Tell the judge that! ( All shouting ) What's the call? The call is get the fuck out of here! Headquarters is pulling everyone out of the field. The chief's not talking to the mayor, and the mayor's not talking to the chief. I guess they're mad at each other, just like my five-year-old and my seven-year-old. Back up! Back up! Now who's in charge, boomer?! There's nothing we can do. This place is going up. Give me back my boy! Get the fuck out of my face before I arrest your black ass! Hey! ( Shouting ) We got citizens here that need our help! They're tearing this place up! Now, come on! It's not our fuckin' problem! These assholes got themselves to blame! Our orders are to be redeployed and return to the station! Over and out. We got Rodney king to thank for this shit! You wanna play robo-cop? Fuck you! We're outta here, boomer. Come on, man! ( Banging on police car ) Give me back my boy! Just stay back! Woman: I hate you motherfuckers! Just stand back! 12-0-51, officer needs assistance at the golden west mall. We have major incidents here. Fires are being set, people are looting. Dispatcher: 12-0-51, there are no units available at this time. Officer needs assistance. Repeat: Officer needs assistance. Withdraw from the area. What?! Repeat that! I repeat: All units are to withdraw from the area. Hey! Hey! Back up! Back up! ( All shouting ) Back off! Boomer: Are you all right? Beating victim: Oh, shit. Sir, are you all right? Are you okay? Come on. Do you have a car? Do you have a car? Get in it. Go home. Go! What are you gonna do, man? Yeah! Son of a bitch! ( Explosion ) Oh, yeah, we gonna get you! Back up. Ain't so fair now, huh? Look at you! Yeah, man! Let's fuck him up right here! Goddamn piggly-wiggly! Oh, yeah, we gonna get you! Vamonos, hombre! What you gonna do with that stick, huh? What you gonna do now? ( Car alarm ) Fuck him up! ( Siren wails ) Go to hell! Odelle! ( Gunshot ) ( Gunshot ) ( Screaming ) Woman: Well? Man: What am I lookin' at? Do you see that tiny little light right there? Yeah. What about it? That's your child. We're a family. They let me keep the tape. Now, I know we said that we wanted to savor our first baby, but I can work all the way up until... Hey, whoa, whoa. Don't worry about that. That's... that's our baby? Yeah. I'm a father? That's me? Yeah. Mmm. Thank you, Turner. I know this move was tough for you, but it's gonna get better for US, especially now. You'll see. I mean, we got more space, you're closer to work.... It's just what we said we wanted, right? Right, right. Yes. So why you been acting like we runnin' out on somebody, then? I mean, we just changed streets. Is there something wrong with wanting our child to grow up without worrying about being shot at every day? Now, listen to how you sound. You know people get shot at all over this whole city. I lived in crenshaw all my life... Both: And nobody's ever took a shot at me. That's right. And you either. Am I right? Right. All right. We're cool. But I don't want to take that chance with my baby, Turner. And neither should you. You're right. You're right. Mm-hmm. Oh, I'm sorry, I just... I want this to work out for US so bad, Turner. We earned this. And we could really build something here if you just give it a chance. Sweetie, listen, I'm happy to be here. You are? I love you. I'm a father! ( Laughs ) Hey, I'm a dad! Everyone's in a state of breathless anticipation. Pat? What is the mood right now, Brian? You say there is beefed-up security. Are there fears that there may be some kind of violence? Hey, Turner. Uh, do you have to go down to your mama's house today? Well, I told her I was gonna get my stuff. Something wrong? Is something wrong? No? Huh? Just promise me you'll be careful. 'Cause if they let those cops off... Baby, they can't be that stupid. Just promise. I promise. I promise. I'm gonna bring you back some pickles and onions. Mama's gonna flip when she gets the news. Pickles and onions... I got 'em! And ice cream. That too. I got all the flavors you need! I got mo' flavors! Bye, baby! ( Starts car ) ( R & b on radio ) ♪ If you just open up ♪ ♪ tonight ♪ ♪ slow down ♪ ♪ We gotta pull out, people ♪ ♪ tonight, so right... ♪ Man: Hey, Turner. What's up, fellas? Vernon! Man: Turner! Come on back, boy! How you doin', youngblood? Hey. Young enough to kick your rusty behind. Got some beans for ya. Yeah, that'll work. Man, you know, this place has not changed in thirty years. I told you this before, vee, but I'm glad you left my pop's name up there, man. I owed him that much. You know, your father had a rare gift. Yeah? What is that? He never asked nobody for nothin' he couldn't give back to 'em by the end of the day. He was his own man. I hear that. And I look at you. I look at you, I look at my dad... Y'all started your own business. Me, I got no stake. I don't own Jack. Your father always said you want something bad enough, you gotta do for self. Well, you're not doing so bad, Turner. You got a good woman, a new house... I'd change places with you anytime. Brother, it's all good. I cannot complain. Matter of fact, you got any of them big-ass cigars laying around? I'm gonna drop some of them over at the barber shop. You know where the cigars are. What's the matter, somebody have a baby or something? That's the rumor. Come on. Come here! I'm so happy for you, Turner! Your gonna make a great dad. Nate's boy. I'll be damned. TV: Well, you heard the verdict, the verdict came in. You're probably surprised some of you, a sense of surprise among some of the journalists here in the media-slash- jury room upstairs. We've got basically "not guilty" on every count.. They let 'em all go? Woman on TV: Shall we accept the fact that this was a race trial? That it was white america's justice system trying itself for the beating of an African-American male, something they've done for years, since slavery. You go check on your mom, make sure Maggie's okay. I said, "it's gonna be an acquittal." Man: I just want to say to everybody in the community that we need to stay calm, stay cool, we don't need no unnecessary confrontation with the law, because god will take care of US in times like these. Because "'vengeance is mine, ' sayeth the lord." Now, do we we understand that? Honk for justice, young brother. ( Honks horn ) I'm with that. All right. ( Men shouting ) Get outta here! Yeah! Keep your ass out of this neighborhood! ( Horns honking ) This is not gonna be an overnight decision based upon what the verdict is, but definitely gonna change my life and I gotta find something else to do with it. Look at the devil smiling! Would you hold still?! I told y'all they was gonna let 'em off. Ain't no way in the world they gonna lock up them white boys. And they policemen too? Shoot. I knew that when they moved it to simi valley. Ain't but two negroes out there, and they both in jail! ( Laughter ) Lisa, find something else on that TV, please. Yo, L.A.'s fittin' to go crazy. Y'all can believe that. Turner: What's up, man? Yeah, right. Hey, buddy boy! Hey, mama. Hey, Turner. I thought you were coming by after work. I took half a day off. I can do that now, mama. I'm the manager. Yo, Turner, you see that verdict? Man, I'm not even thinking about that madness. They didn't even try and give 'em a fair trial. White folks do whatever they want to. So what else is new? I'm gonna tell y'all one thing- black man needs to watch his step tonight. You're damn right, because it is open season on a nigger! Yo, hold on, right here. TV ..Lerman was less reserved. Lerman: It sends a bad message. It says its okay to beat somebody when they're down, and kick the crap out of 'em, and it's okay because if it's not videotaped don't worry about it, another brother officer won't turn you in, and if a brother officer does turn you in, don't worry, we'll get white jurors or whatever it takes, and you'll walk. I know my client would have made a hell of a good witness, he wanted to testify, but they chose not to... They didn't even let the brother testify?! Lisa, if you can't find something better to watch, turn it off. Turn it off? Unh-unh, Maggie! The revolution's gonna be televised this time! You shut up. ( Laughter ) It's gonna be televised this time. This time it's on. I'll get you some change, Cheryl. They gonna show this one. In living color. ( Laughter ) Mom, you're working too hard. You look tired. I am tired. If I hear another word about Rodney king, I'm gonna beat up on somebody myself. Let me see these feet. Oh, that feels good. I got something for you. All right. For your new house. You're gonna have a lot of family pictures on your mantle. Nate and Maggie, lookin' cleaner than the board of health. Look at you, mom. ( Both laugh ) Thank you. You know, I stopped by the old liquor store today. Vernon says hi. You always say that like you own that place. Maybe sometimes I wish I did. It's got nice memories for me, you know? You ever feel that way, mom? Unh-unh. All I see when I look at that store is the place where your father died. Why'd you stay in L.A.? Where was I gonna go, Turner... With a three-year-old boy and a half a stake in a burned-out liquor store? You coulda gone back to Texas. Unh-unh. I owed it to your father to get that business back on its feet. Then why did you sell it later? A lot of bad memories in that store for me, Turner. There comes a time when you just gotta move on. How's Linda? Oh, Linda's cool. She want to the doctor, and her hormones are jumping around like they're on soul train. ( Chuckling ) She's all right, though, huh? Yeah. She's just a little pregnant. Well, you tell her that I said she... She's what? We're gonna have a baby, mom. ( Both laughing ) I'm gonna be a dad, grandma. Thank you, son. Thank you. This whole thing would have never happened, all this money would have never been spent and all this ill feeling would have never taken place if one individual had been traveling 55 miles an hour like he was supposed to be doing. Listen to this devil. ( Loud crash outside ) What the hell was that? Oh, shit! Look out there! Do you see any police out there? That shit is crazy! Y'all come on away from that window, I got an announcement to make! Raoul oughta take a look at this. All right, Keith. Turner got some news. Tell 'em, Turner. Gonna be mad city. What the hell is going on? ( Glass breaking, people shouting outside ) Where you going? Where you going? Why don't they just drive off? They better get out of there. Serves 'em right! Woman: You ought to be ashamed of yourself! ( All shouting ) Get him! Get him! Boone, go out there with him, please. Yes, ma'am. ( Shouting ) Lay off, man! Get the fuck off! This Mexican wasn't on the jury! They gotta pay! What's up with your man?! What you doing around here? I thought you moved. You picked the wrong day for a visit, nigger. What's up with you, man? Just getting a little payback, that's all. That's for motherfuckin' Rodney king, bitch! You wrong, brother. Yeah? We handin' out ass-whippings as casual as the fuckin' LAPD. To who? To US brothers? Does that shit make sense? Does the fuckin' verdict make sense, fool? You better wake up, brother. They don't give a fuck about you. When you go down to it, this might be the only thing that does make sense... An eye for a motherfuckin' eye. Fuck that bullshit! Take that shit to simi valley, not here! Boone, you need to take him on out of here with the rest of the house niggers, because the field hands is takin' over the plantation today, motherfucker. Yeah. Yeah, fool. We ain't got no more cheeks to turn, brother. Bee, you're wrong. This is our neighborhood, man! Come on. Where the fuck are the police now, huh? I ain't never seen nothin' like that. Lisa, call 911. We closed, y'all. Go on home. Lord! If they ain't protestin' down in Parker center. What's wrong with you, running out there in that mess? Somebody's gotta do something. I said y'all go on home. Anybody going towards inglewood? I would rather not wait on the bus. I'll give you a ride. Hey, Boone, check you out later. Y'all get home safe. Mama, get your stuff together. I want you to stay with me and Linda at the house. There are times you look just like Nathaniel, you know that? You have a lot of him in you, too. Son... Please, don't underestimate these people out here. Most of 'em, they're just lookin' for an excuse. Mom, get your things. We're gonna be fine. Really. We're all gonna be okay. Go get your bag, all right? I couldn't get through to the police. Lisa, you need a ride? Yeah. Thank you so much, Boone. I'll see you tomorrow, miss Maggie. Take care, baby. Please take care. Oh. What was your news, Turner? Oh, uh, Linda's pregnant. We've having a baby. Oh, that's great, Turner! Okay, bye. Congratulations. Come on. Let's go. Now! Now. Mom. Mom. We gotta go. Yeah. Yeah. ( News statement playing over loudspeakers ) we all saw with our own eyes wasn't a crime. Senseless and brutal beating of a helpless man. Today that jury said we should tolerate such conduct by those who are sworn to protect and serve... No, our eyes did not deceive US... Raymond! What we saw was a crime. No, we will not tolerate the savage beatings of our citizens by a few renegade cops... No... Turner: Mom! Mom, come on! Mom! We gotta get Vernon! Give voice to our great frustration. I know that we must express our profound outrage, our anger, but we must do so in ways that bring honor... ( Siren wails ) Girl, come on. ( Shouting ) Come on. I don't want you in the car alone. Mom! Come on. Come on. Let's go. ( Shouting, horns honking ) Now ain't the time to be joy-riding. Vernon, we came back for you, man, so get your stuff. We're gonna go. I'm not going. There won't be be four walls standing in the morning if I leave here. Don't be a fool, Vernon. If they get in here, it'll wipe me out. You know that! Y'all go on now. Vernon, come on. We ain't got time for that mess. I'm tellin' you. ( Knock on door ) Come on in, odelle. Hey, man, it's spreading. What you gonna do? I'm gettin' the hell out of here. It's nothing but an old dry cleaners plant. They want to loot it, the hell with 'em. The insurance company or the government will pay for it anyhow. Bullshit. You stayin'? I gotta stay. These are still my folks, right or wrong. Yeah, well, your folks are fittin' to burn down the whole damn neighborhood to the ground. I'm gettin' out of here. Be careful, now. Y'all go on now. What are you gonna do against all these people by yourself? Don't you see they're getting ready to explode? And they don't care who they hurt! Maggie, everything I got is in this store. Everything. Now, I survived '65, and I'm gonna survive this one. Vernon. Y'all go on now. Besides, I'm not all that helpless. Vernon, we're not gonna walk out of here without you. I'm serious, now! I'm stayin'! Stop it! This place took one man away from me already, and I'll be damned if I'll see it happen again! Nathaniel underestimated all those people out there, and it cost him his life. Please... Please... don't make the same mistake. ( Glass breaking ) Mama, stay away from the windows. Vernon, don't go out there! Vernon, I got this. I got your back. Hey! What the fuck you doin'?! This here is a black-owned business, and it's closed. You got it? Yeah, right. What's the matter with you? You didn't get enough shit from the mall? Huh? Then take your ass on down to city hall and show them how you feel. Buses ain't runnin', Turner. You need to take that shit home, man. You're the one that need to go home, brother. The revolution is on right now. I am home. Now, think about this. Is this how we're gonna protest the verdict? We're gonna tear our own shit up? You think they give a fuck? They're laughing at US! What the fuck do we own around here, brother? Y'all got your geography mixed. That's right! Why you wanna burn down your own neighborhood? If you want to uprise so bad, why don't you go rise up the man's ass... oww! Yeah! It's on, baby! Vernon! You all right? Vernon. You okay, man? Yeah, I'm gonna make it. ( Glass breaking ) Oh, put that back. Why you doin' this? I gotta go get mama. It's not fair what you're doing! Fair ain't got nothing to do with it! Give me my pocketbook. She took my pocketbook! Hey! Go on with you! Move out of the way! Oh, god. Call the doctor. Call the ambulance! Vernon, can you handle it? Mom, there is no ambulance. I'm gonna get the car. Carlos: Get in! Fuck it! Hey! Hey, motherfucker! That's my car! ( Glass breaking ) ( Horns honking ) Did you get a doctor? They took the car. I'm gonna get odelle and we'll get help. We've gotta get him out. I'll be back, mama. Turner, please! Mom, I'll be back. Turner, no! Turner!!! Over here! Over here! Baby, I got it. Nate, please, you don't understand. Don't worry about it. I don't want you to go out there by yourself.

We've got to get Vernon out of here. Didn't find no help, huh? Come on, y'all, come on! We ain't gonna find any help around here. ( Glass breaking ) Don't do it, son. Don't do it. That's not all that's left of him, believe me. Please. You're right, mama. We're what's left of him. Me, you, the baby. Vernon: I guess that's that. They didn't do shit to help rebuild the last time. They're not gonna do shit to help rebuild now. It's just like you said, Vernon... Time to do for self. ♪♪...
