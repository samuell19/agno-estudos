Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Irene, allow me to be the first to issue many happy returns of the day. Now that you are 21, I- Just a moment. I have a birthday speech all prepared. All right, go ahead. - Lovely Irene- - Just one moment. I'd rather not have any quarrel between you two. I'll make the speech. - Not a chance. - Oh. You're the youngest. - You'll have to wait. - Come, come, come. - No, no, no. - Don't fight about it. No, no, no, no, no, I'll make the speech. Who has a better right than I? Irene, darling, you know how they, your three good friends love you. But all three of them do not love you as much as I. We wish you every happiness. Oh, thank you, Father. That's very sweet of you. There. Now, give us all a nice birthday kiss. Let's sit by the fire and have a smoke before we turn in, hm? - Irene? - What, Tommy? Stay here a minute. Well, what is it? I've known you for years, Irene. That's a long time. A long time to love you, and not even tell you. Why, Tommy! Well, I was afraid to tell you, but now you're 21 and I can ask you. Irene, will you marry me? Oh, why, Tommy, are you serious? More than you know. I guess I haven't much chance. I haven't a glib tongue like Frank, I'm not a clever newspaper reporter, I don't wear a handsome uniform like Walter. - Now, Tom- - Irene, Thomas, why all the secrets? Coming. For only one love. My heart is aching. If I am sleeping. If I am waking I can't help but dream of you. Two hands so gentle. My fate are holding. Until the day when. True love's unfolding I can't help but dream of you. My heart is longing. For you I long, beloved. When you are smiling. A world of joy I see. No words can tell you. How much I really love you. You'll never know, dear. How much you mean to me. Throughout each day, each year. You'll find me near I'll wait for you. Until you say to me so tenderly. I do love you. Then all my longing. For you I long, beloved. Will not have been in vain. For then you will be mine. Lovely. Thank you. That wind, it makes me shiver. Lovely night to be out. Just the sort of night to tell good goose fleshy stories. Frank, Frank. You know, I'd like to meet one of these old castle ghosts that one hears about, just for an interview. But- - Oh, what a story that'd make! I'd get a promotion on a scoop like that. You joke about it, but strange things do happen, even in these days. Mysterious things. You know what I'm thinking of, don't you, Mr. von Helldorf? I? Why? You know, the Blue Room. Why talk about that? It's Irene's birthday. What about the Blue Room? Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. Just-Tommy means the blue salon in the castle here. The room has been locked for 20 years. Didn't you know about it? Locked for 20 years? Have we a ghost in our midst? Do you mean the Blue Room is haunted? Oh, nonsense. There are no spooks. - But- - But what? Remember what happened to Blue Beard's wife when she got too curious. Tell me about it. Well, three persons met death there, under strange, peculiar circumstance. - You can't- - Yes, Paul. We have house guests, you can't come in tonight. - I will not be any problem? - No, no, no. Wait at least until they're all asleep. I'd rather not speak of it. It's long ago now, and better left forgotten. You can't stop now, you've got to go on. Yes, Father, do tell us. I've never know what really happened. And you might find a solution to all the mystery. I'm afraid that's above even our Frank here. Oh, Mr. von Helldorf, I don't think I'm so brilliant. It's other people that do. Well, if you must hear it. Irene was still a baby. My sister was staying with us at the time. She was sleeping in the Blue Room, our guest chamber. One night, I was just about to retire. It was one o'clock. And suddenly I heard a scream from my sister's room. I ran across the corridor and tried to get in. There was no answer to my pounding on the door, so we broke the door down. The Blue Room was empty. The window was wide open, and underneath lying in the moat, we found my sister's body. An accident of course, that's what I thought. And I still would believe that today, if four months later, my best friend hadn't been found shot in the same room, the same hour, one o'clock. That couldn't have been suicide? Suicide was very improbable. My friend was living in the best of circumstances, happy with life. We'd just parted, the best of spirits. And yet at one o'clock, a shout rang out in that fatal room. No revolver was ever found. And both happened at one o'clock. But you said there were three tragedies. Yes. A detective made up his mind to spend a night in the Blue Room. In the morning, we found him on the floor, dead. On his face was still frozen the look of agonized horror. The physician claimed the death was due to heart failure, caused by a great fright. This is better than any story I could write. Even you admit it. Now you understand why I never want to go into that room again. Paul, our butler is the only one who has a key. Oh, come on now. Snap out of it. We are not at a funeral. Not yet. Oh, he will see the bright side. Coffee, Sir, Good heavens, I was frightened to death. That's when you get for bringing up the subject. I'm sorry, it was all my fault. He must get credit, even when he's at fault. Let's talk about something else. What should it be? Polo, bridge, love? Let's talk about the man Irene's going to marry. What'll he have to look like? Well, give me time to think him up. Please, Irene, let's have it. Well, if you insist. First of all, he must be very good looking. Good looking? That lets you out, Tommy. You may go outside. He must be young, but not too young. All right, Tommy, you may come back again. And most of all, he must have courage. I have courage. Look at the brave young man. All right, laugh if you like. I'll prove I have courage. I shall prove it to Irene. This is going to be good. How are you going about it? I shall sleep in the Blue Room tonight. No nonsense like that, Thomas. I mean it. I'm going to prove that I'm no coward. Would you do as much? No one is questioning your bravery young man. Why be absurd about proving it? You're afraid? I don't need to prove my courage. Leave him alone. I think it's a great idea, and what's more a great story. A night with a ghost. I shall certainly accept the challenge. And what about you? Well, all right, I am with you. You're making too much of all this. Not at all. I propose that each of us will sleep a night in the Blue Room. It's my idea, so I should be the first, but there's one point we'll have to agree to. If something should happen to one of us, it mustn't prevent the next one from spending the following night in the Blue Room in spite of what may have occurred. Is it agreed? All right, agreed. Fine. Paul? Get us the keys to the Blue Room. Shall I, shall I give them the key, Sir? But of course. I really wish you wouldn't do this. Irene's right. It's absurd to take unnecessary chances, but it might result in a solution to the entire mystery. Don't worry, the goat won't bite us. Here we are. Come on, Paul, open the door. I want to warn you Mr. Thomas- - We know, we know, there's a horrible curse on the Blue Room. Come on, open it. Well? Where's the light? Here, here it is. So, this is the Blue Room? Looks rather comfortable to me. How musty is smells. Old rooms always smell like that. Oh, is that window where- - Yes. It's about 20 feet down to the water. It was here we found my friend. And over there, the detective was lying two days later. How uncanny it sounds. Better leave this closed. And each time the door was locked from the inside? Yes, that was part of the problem. There was never any indications a second person could've been in the room, - and yet- - How curious. Maybe it was you, old Iron Sides. How's your nerves holding out old boy? Still time to back out you know? I'm not backing out. Are you? Well, at least you'll leave the door open, Tommy. You needn't be anxious about me, Irene. I can take care of myself. Well, brave boy, it's time to go to bed. Sleep well and don't be late for breakfast. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight, Tommy. Goodnight, Irene. Well, goodnight, Tommy. We'll all be anxious to hear how you get along with the ghost. Oh, by the way, I hope it's a lady ghost. It's impossible tonight. Somebody is sleeping Blue Room. - But when- - Come back tomorrow. I'm sick of you. Walter? Walter? Listen. Walter, tell me... Oh, put down your book. What do you want? Say now, you don't believe in all that do ya? Ah, tomorrow morning we all be laughing about it. Yeah. Oh, come on. Let's get some sleep. Goodnight. - Oh, Irene. - Oh, Tommy, I was so nervous. - But dear, I- - I know something will happen to you. Please, Tommy, don't stay in this room tonight. You wouldn't want me to be a quitter? Why not? Oh, I couldn't stand having the others laugh at me. Oh, it must be terrible to be a man and have to be brave. Thank goodness I can be a coward with a clean conscious. Tommy, please don't stay here tonight. Irene, if I knew that you were worried because I mean more to you than anyone else... Oh, Irene, I'd do anything you ask. Oh, please, Tommy. I'm going to stay. Goodnight, Tommy. Goodnight, Irene. Walter? Walter? Oh, what's the matter now? It's one o'clock. It usually is this time of the night. What if something happened to Tommy? Oh, nothing's going to happen to him. Please, let's get some sleep. Now listen, of course that story is nonsense isn't it? Well, I tell you, I don't know about that. You see, one o'clock was the hour. Yes? And after all- - "After all," what? And after all, go to sleep! Listen. Say, what's the matter now? Don't you hear anything? No. That's very strange. What? Helldorf's car just left. Now, at this hour? I wonder what that means. Oh, well, we'll find out tomorrow morning. Maybe. Goodnight. There's no sound from Tommy either. Of course not because he's asleep. Goodnight once again. Goodnight. Mr. Thomas? Half past eight, Sir. So worrying about Tommy kept you from sleeping? Yes, I was afraid for him. Lucky boy. But tonight, I shall have the honor. And tomorrow night young lady, I shall look forward to a very exploratory evening. Morning, darling. - Good morning, Father. - Morning. - Good morning. - Morning. Where's Tommy? Oh, I guess he's late as usual. Mr. von Helldorf! Mr. von Helldorf, Mr. Thomas doesn't answer. I've knocked and knocked, Sir, and I can't seem to arouse him. Tommy? Tommy, open the door. Tommy? Now none of your joking. Oh, Tommy, please answer us. Give me the key, Paul. I haven't the key, Sir. Mr. Thomas locked the door on the inside. And there is only one key? Yes, Sir. Oh, I hope nothing happened to him. Oh, please, quiet! Let's break the door down. Mr. von Helldorf, this window was closed last night. Yes, exactly the way it happened before. Oh, don't say that. Oh, everything can be explained. Well, go ahead, explain. He possibly opened the window and leaned out too far. You mean suicide? Ridiculous. What reason could he have? Well, maybe it was an accident. Well, I'll have a search started for him at once. I'll go with you. Oh, this is frightful. Oh, Irene, don't excite yourself. I'll take you to your room. You better have this lock fixed right away. Right away, Sir. Mary, Mary, did you hear what happened last night? Don't tell me the old cat's had kittens again. No, no. It's Mr. Thomas. What? He disappeared. Where to? If we knew where he was he wouldn't be disappeared, stupid. He slept in the Blue Room. The ghost room? And he's gone. Paul, is it really true about, Mr. Thomas? Yes. I warned 'em, but they laughed at me. But I tell you that anybody who sleeps in the Blue Room is never heard of again. Good morning, Max. Good morning, Sir. Trouble? Yes, the ignition's gone bad again. Must've happened this morning, huh? This morning? Mr. Faber said he saw the car leave here about one o'clock. Mr. Faber must've been mistaken. The car hasn't been out since yesterday morning. Well, it's easy to mistake a car at night. Yes. Wait here. Very strange. Too strange. Anything new? Not much. We found this. Tommy's. Yes. We found it 20 yards beyond the castle. Across the moat? Yes. This thing grows more involved every moment. I think you oughta call the police. - I think you're right. - No, no, don't, don't. Let us search the water first. Don't bring the police here, not now. That only means the newspapers. If we can find the body there without the police... Well, have you thought it over? Yeah, and I don't wanna have anything more to do with ya. All right, then I'll tell them what happened last night. You don't dare. You just watch me. Eh, you! No, I can't believe it was an accident. The coincidence is so- - Paul, what has happened? I heard Ms. Irene scream, Sir, and I found her on the floor. Irene, Irene, do you hear me? Tell us, darling, what has happened? Walter, is he gone? Who? Who was here? A strange man. He came at me and grabbed me. A strange man? Did you see anybody, Paul? I did not, Sir. A stranger could hardly have entered the room. Every door leading to the outside is locked. Oh, but he was here, I saw him with my own eyes. He came at me and... Well, of course someone was here. Irene couldn't have imagined that, and what's more he'll be coming back. You think so? Perhaps sooner than we think. Providing we don't call the police. Why? Because if you call the police, he's be warned. But if he does come back again he'll find me. I will sleep in here tonight. Good evening, Paul. What are you doing here? - Oh, I- - Goon. Go to bed. I beg of you, Frank, please don't stay in that room tonight. Now, Irene, just because something happened to Tommy, it's no reason for me to show the white feather. - Yes, I know, but just- - It's no use. Ever since we found out that this ghost seems to have human features, I'm very anxious to see that. All right, Frank, but it's understood if you hear the slightest noise- I know. I shoot. And six chambers ought to be enough for any ghost. Well, time to go to bed. Now, I don't want you to be worried. I'll take my courage with me. So long. Goodnight, Irene. Goodnight. You sound as though you were saying goodbye. Goodnight, Walter. Goodnight, old boy. Oh, I think Frank was right. It's bed time for little girls. Oh, let me stay up with you. I'm too scared to go to bed. All right, darling. Where's your father? He went to bed an hour ago. - He wasn't feeling very well. - Hm. We haven't found Tommy yet, you know? Oh, I know, it's dreadful. And now, if something should happen to Frank... Oh, don't worry, nothing's going to happen to him. He'll be a jump ahead of whatever it is, - a ghost or- - Or what? Anything. Walter, you've got to promise me you won't sleep in that Blue Room. All right, Irene. I believe I can promise you that. Thank you. Are you sure you wanna stay up all night? Yes, I think it's better that I stay awake. Then I will too. Oh no, Irene, you shouldn't. Why? You see? It isn't worrying Frank much. It's nearly one o'clock. Oh, don't be frightened. And still, you may keep on being just a little frightened. You see? It's all over and everything is all right. Walter, don't go up there. Walter? It came right from there, Sir. Frank? Oh, Walter! Irene, please. What's happened? Yes, Frank. Frank? - He's shot. - Good God. We must let the police know now. Get Commissioner Forster from Homicide Squad. - Yes, Sir. - I shall lock the door myself. I want to talk to him personally. Yes, Sir. Not a shot fired. Hello, Homicide Squad. Captain Brink. Thank you. Captain Brink speaking. I want to talk to Commissioner Forster. No, Commissioner's away until morning. What's the trouble? Murder? Where? Helldorf Castle? All right, I'll get in touch with him right away. He can be out there by nine o'clock. All right. - Forster's coming. - You know him? Oh yes, he's a very good detective. Let's hope he'll put an end to all this. Someone is ringing from the Blue Room. What? That's impossible. I locked the door with this key. Don't you hear? - Come on, Paul. - You better stay here. How did a cat ever get in here? Are you sure there is no other key to this room? There is no other key, Sir. The gun! Oh, Mary, the Commissioner wants to talk to you upstairs. What have I got to do with your murders? They ain't my murders. Don't believe in mixin' myself up in other folks' murders. Come on, get along. Where's Betty? In the garage with Max. Go and get both of 'em. Oh, did they do 'em? Nevermind your questions. Maybe you did it yourself. The whole thing seems to have no solution, Commissioner. We'll see, Mr. Brink. Everything can be solved. Oh, come in, come in. Don't hesitate. Won't you sit down? Now everybody is here I believe. Let's begin. Who was the first to discover the dead man? The butler and I. And a little later, Ms. Irene. Where were you when you heard the shot? Here, in this room. Anyone with you? I was sitting there with Ms. Irene. Did you leave the instant you heard the shot? Instantly. Did you note the exact time? About half a minute after one. Thank you. The butler, please. You also heard the shot didn't you? Yes. Where were you at the moment? I was in my room. I was getting ready for bed. Where is your room located? In the right wing of the castle at the end of the corridor. That's enough now. Sit down. Kruger? And now, Mr. von Helldorf, please. You also heard the shot? No. I was fast asleep. I had gone to bed at 11 'cause I wasn't feeling well. I didn't wake until I heard the commotion. Thank you, Mr. von Helldorf. Thank you. That's very interesting. The butler again, please. There's something else I want to ask you. Come here. You said a moment ago you heard the shot in your room. Is that correct? Yes. Exactly how much later did the butler arrive after you, Mr. Brink? We both arrived at the same moment. Well, well, isn't that remarkable? I learned from my assistant that it takes exactly a half a minute to run from your room to the Blue Room. Now how do you explain that your arrived there at the same time as Mr. Brink? Well, what have you to say? Then may I answer for you? At the time of the murder you were not in your room. Is that correct? Yes. There, you see? Where were you last night at one o'clock? Come on, where were you? I was in the corridor. I wanted to make certain all the windows were locked. Oh, and you didn't have a chance to do that sooner I suppose? I suddenly got nervous. You see, the disappearance of Mr. Thomas was still praying on my mind. I, I was nervous and couldn't sleep. Oh, you couldn't sleep? Well, isn't that too bad? That's enough. Sit down. Mary, the cook. Mr. Commissioner, I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't hear a thing. And I'm deaf anyhow, so how could I commit a murder? And anyhow, I was asleep all the time. You believe me don't you, Mr. Commissioner? All right, all right. Stop your bawling. And please remember it isn't my murder. Not so sure about that. The chauffeur, please. Did you hear the shot? No, Sir, I was asleep at the time. What's more, I couldn't have heard the shot because my quarters are too far from the house. Where were you the night Mr. Thomas Brandt slept in the Blue Room? In my room, Commissioner. And yet, the car was out of the garage at one o'clock. What's your answer to that? I know nothing about it, Sir. Don't believe him, Mr. Detective. He's a liar by the clock. You seem to be well informed, young lady. Come here. Well? I saw him drive the car that night myself with these two eyes. - That's not true. - It most certainly is. I stood in the back of the garage and I saw everything. Don't you believe here, she's lying. You're lying. You're lying! Just a moment, one of you must be lying. Probably both. The question is, which is the better at it? It's him, Mr. Commissioner. He can give you cards in spades on lying. After all, I've got two eyes in my head and I see what I see. And when I told him I was gonna tell right out there in the corridor, he grabbed me and choked me. He said he would kill me if I told a living soul. When did all this happen? Just now, about five minutes ago just before we came into this room. Every bone in my body still hurts the way he shook me. Oh, Mr. Commissioner, you don't- - Just a moment, just a moment. It's still lighted. Mm, good cigar. It's yours isn't it? Young lady, do you realize how accomplished this man is? He managed to shake and choke you without dropping the ash? What reasons have you for incriminating him? - Mr. Commissioner- - Don't you realize that in making false statements you incriminate yourself? I'm going to place you under arrest. That's a very good idea, Sir. Get up and sit down. Mr. Commissioner, please, I'll tell everything. It's high time. Go on. Last night I saw a strange man leave the Blue Room. What time was that? It was about a quarter past 12, just before Mr. Faber entered the Blue Room. You're not making another mistake are you? This strange man story doesn't sound quite convincing. But Sir, I recognized him. Who was it? Come on, let's have it. Well, the strange man that left the Blue Room was not alone. Did you recognize the person with him? Who was it? Oh, I- - Answer my question. Is that person in this room now? Where? Mr. von Helldorf. Is the statement of this girl correct? No, the girl's lying. Oh, I see. You can sit down. You told me that you went to bed around 11 o'clock. Is that correct? I did. And you were awakened by the noise? Yes. At what time did you arrive at the room of the murder? Well, I can't say exactly but- - Oh, excuse me, Mr. von Helldorf, but you arrived just after we got there didn't you? Oh, I see. What did Mr. von Helldorf wear when he arrived? I... Oh, the same suit he has on now. This is interesting indeed. I thought you said you were asleep at the time. How could you dress and get to the scene of the murder so quickly? Mr. von Helldorf, forgive me if I'm obliged to doubt your statements. Sorry, but it can't be avoided. Nothing in my power to prevent that. At any rate, I must insist that nobody leaves this house until further orders. Phone headquarters and have 'em send a few more men up here. Thank you very much. That'll be all for the time being. Oh, and Maid, you stay here. Come on, come on. Now we're going to have a nice, friendly little talk all by ourselves. You seem to be very well informed. Tell me, have you noticed anything else out of the ordinary? - Yes. - What? - Well, last night- - What time was it? It was 10 minutes after 12. I was going along the corridor and I saw Paul, the butler, standing in front of the window making funny signals with a flashlight. What else? Go on. What else? Nothing else, that's all. Now there's one other thing I'd like to learn. Sure. What were you doing so late in the corridor? What were you doing in the garage that night? And why do you roam all over the house instead of going to sleep as good girls do? And how can you tell time so exactly? She cat. Did she try to get my head in a noose. Max, tell me honestly, didn't you do it? What, the murder? Somebody did. Don't be foolish. I will admit I had the car out that night. That's true but... There you are. You know where I was? Committin' the murder. I was over at the village seein' a new girlfriend of mine. I take her out for a ride every once in awhile. That's why Betty's jealous. Oh, that's it. Yeah, and am I glad to be rid of her. - Max? - Hm? Tell me just one more thing, didn't you honestly commit the murder? Which one of the windows was it? Oh, this one. No, a little more to your right. I can't believe Helldorf has anything to do with the affair. The idea seems to be out of line. My dear, Mr. Brink, you'd make a very poor detective if you let personal feelings influence you. But when I phoned for the police, he was standing right by me. That proves he couldn't have removed the gun. Nobody said he did. Still, there is the possibility he might have some connection with the person who did. Impossible. I can't understand why you defend Helldorf. How do you account for his connection with the strange man he was seen with by the maid? All right, get ready. Let go. Let go. Let go of me. Follow me. Yes, but how in the world did the cat ever get in here? It's simple enough. Somebody has a second key. And who do you suppose has it? If I knew that do you suppose I'd be kneeling down here on the floor? Wait here. - We've got him, Sir. - Bring him in. Come in. Good evening. Get Helldorf, Ms. Irene and the maid. Yes, Sir. Will you sit down? Well, I hope you don't get tired. What did you come into this house for? Did you understand my question? Yes. I shall not answer it. Oh, come in. Don't hesitate, ladies and gentlemen. Is this the man you saw leave the room with Mr. von Helldorf? Yes. That's the man who attacked me. Mr. von Helldorf, I must insist that you tell me all that you know of this man. And if I refuse? I must place you under arrest as his accomplice. Father! What's your answer? Oh, it's no use anymore. I'll tell you everything. No, please, don't. I must. Can I speak to you alone for a few minutes? Certainly. Will everybody leave, please? And take good care of him. And now, what is it you want to tell me? What I'm going to tell you, Mr. Commissioner, has nothing whatever to do with either of the crimes committed here. The man you have arrested, my brother. What? Yes, and more, he's Irene's father. Do you expect me to believe that? Yes. 20 years ago he left his wife and little Irene. Go ahead. Well, I took care of them both. The mother died shortly afterwards, and Irene grew up in the belief that I was her father. The only other person besides myself who knows the truth is our butler, Paul. And in all that time you heard nothing from your brother? No. Not until the day before yesterday when he came here, broken in body as well as his spirit, and wanted some money to leave the country. I was about to give it to him tonight, but the detectives arrested him before I had the opportunity. How do you account for the attack on your daughter? Oh, that wasn't an attack. He hadn't seen his daughter in 20 years. He forgot himself, rushed toward her and... I can tell you now where I was last night. I'd gone with my brother to talk things over. When I returned, the murder had been committed. Why didn't you tell me all this before? Well, I- - Nevermind. It's just a thought I had. Of course I'll have to check your story with the facts. Certainly. May I go now? Certainly. Thanks. I beg of you not to mention this to anyone, particularly Irene. I understand. Thank you. Walter, I still can't believe that Father had anything to do with it. - Oh, it seems impossible. - Irene? Father, what does all this mean? Don't get excited, child. I had nothing to do with any of this. But who was the strange man? He, uh... I'm feeling very tired now. I must get some sleep. All right. Any new developments? Von Helldorf gave me an explanation. - What? - Such as it was. His story sounds a little melodramatic. You think Helldorf is guilty? In any case, he knows more than he's telling us. Commissioner, I am going to sleep in that room tonight. - You believe them? - I believe nothing so far, but I want to find out. If Helldorf's guilty, nothing will happen tonight because he'll be cautious. But if it is someone unknown, he may return. You're right. Of course, you realize you may be risking your life. I'm not afraid. I've got an idea. Come with me. And you'll meet me downstairs in my bedroom? Yes. And the house is surrounded. Oh, but the other detectives are officially dismissed? An hour ago. Let's hope that our preparations bring results. We shall get him, whoever he is, sooner or later. Goodnight. Goodnight. Be cautious. Two minutes to one. Not a soul in here. Get rid of that dummy. Helldorf has left his room. You three search the house. It came from directly behind this wall. Get an ax quick, we'll have to tear it down. You stay here. You three follow me. Oh, Walter! Walter, are you all right? Yes, dear. Come, this is frightful. No. Come on. Tommy! Thomas! You probably won't believe me if I tell you why I've done this. Oh, Tommy! You confess to the murder of Frank Faber? - Yes. - Why did you do it? I knew that Walter and Frank stood between me and Irene. You see, I really loved her. You thought after committing this crime Ms. Irene would still marry you? Oh, I must've been insane. I see it now. But how did you choose such a fantastic round about way to get rid of your rivals? A few weeks ago, I found the secret entrance to this room. From that moment, my mind was made up. Go on. I took advantage of the room's history, the old tragedies. So, on Irene's birthday I proposed that each one of us spend a night in this room. After all, you would have had to turn up again, what about that? Well, then I planned to tell about the secret passage. That I was kidnapped, kept prisoner. Come on, Irene. Oh, Mr. von Helldorf, I owe you an apology. I had suspected you. I know, Commissioner. That's why I left the house tonight. I wanted to find the guilty one myself. I hope you won't hold it against me. Why, of course not. Come on. Walter, I still can't believe it. Oh, the poor boy. He couldn't have known what he was doing.
