CANNES 1966 FESTIVAL DEBUT AWARD FOR DIRECTOR MIRCEA MURESAN This whole land, as you can see, was once ours. Over 20,000 pogons, along Arges. (100 square km) It was simply called "Amara Estate". Or lura estate. Now we have less than half. The part beyond the forest was the first given away. The owners become strangers to us. They don't even live in the country. Babaroaga is in this direction. The estate is on the right. My wife's dowry, about 2,500 pogons.(12, 5 square km) Beyond, towards lalonita is the Lespezi estate. It belongs to my brother-in-law, Gogu lonescu. Another 2000 pogons. Both estates are leased to a certain Cosma Butuga So.. In that direction is the village of Humele, the estate of General de Darlat. Further to the left, the village and the estate of Ionita Rotompan, a genuine boyar. Good friend with my father. Domains Ghica... I don't know how many thousands of pogoans. Of course, leased. Stop it, Petre. I want to show you our lands that we still have. What you see here, across the road, is all we have left. About ten thousand pogons. A bit of a chopped piece of land, to my father's despair. However, the most important domain of the county The villages of Barlogu, Ruginoasa... and finally, Amara. Everywhere there is a nice mansion. You will see them. Let's go, Petre. This road leads to Roci where the prefect Boierescu, your rival, has a beautiful estate. All right, Grigore, you showed me so many estates. Estates and estates. Big and beautiful. But where are the lands of the people? The lands of the people? Yes, the lands.. Do you see? That's the peasant problem. There aren't much lands. THE RIOT SCREENPLAY ACCORDING TO LIVIU REBREANU'S NOVEL They're leaving... they're leaving once again.. What is it, Petre? Nothing, boyar... I was talking about cranes, they are leaving. Who's stopping them? The new mansion. I built it six years ago, in 1900. My gift to Nadina for the turn of the century. The old house is over 200 years old. Here's Dad. Hey, God bless you, Mr. Baloleanu. You're just like your father. Welcome, feel yourself at home. What do you know about Nadina, when will she come? I received a telegram, she will be here in a few days. You go hunting? Until you are ready please excuse me. I hope you feel at home. You will rest as a king. There's a silence of paradise here. Please don't be late. Dad maybe upset. Take the luggage to the room over there. Settle in and I'll pick you up. Welcome, sir Grigore,. You heard what it happened to me. I mean, how could? Heard what, Cozma? Your boy. Yes! He's grown up! What is he studying? I sent him to study the law. How much did they steal? At least half a wagon of corn, sir. You see, their luck. It was my fault. It's not a joke... When more peasants gather for stealing, it is no longer a joke. Let's not exaggerate, Dad. The peasants stole another time, too. So, what? Thieves always existed. This is the result of the small talk with which you filled the ears of the peasants. Send here the mayor and the chief of the gendarmerie post. they must find my thieves no matter where they are. Otherwise I take them responsible. Woe to me, Coane Miroane, do you want to set me on fire, to destroy me? I only came to you to complain. I'll take care of this. I consider it of exceptional importance. Evil must be stopped at the root. In time. Izbasescu, go with him. Grigorita, dear, what do you know about the Babaroaga estate? Does Nadina intend to sell it? From me it has only! It's her dowry. But without your consent you know very well that she cannot give away anything! My consent... she has it in advance! No matter to whom she sells it? Yes. Did you come, Petre? You're upset, Petrica. You're mad at me for getting sick. What's my fault, Petrica? I'll get up tomorrow and see my work. Can I get you something to eat, Mom? I brought them, sir. Now tell me who stole the landholder's corn. Are you guarding the barn? You must know who stole. It's a corn wagon! Tell me, boys! What can we say? What wagon? Sergeant... The damage should be about three bags... if it is. If.. Boyar Cozma, the landholder, has also recognized... What else do they want? I swear on God! It's not enough that you stealed, you're naughty, too! And you swear to God too. F***! I mean, how's that, Mayor? The boyar says a wagon has been stolen and the landholder, three bags. Well, the steal of a wagon is investigated different from the steal of three bags! The peasant issue cannot be resolved without sacrifices, Mr. Iuga. The peasant wants land. He knows only that and it hurts him. Forgive me, dear Alexander. It's easy to stir up desires, it's harder to fulfill them. No, Grigorita, that doesn't mean stir up desires. This is dangerous election propaganda. I would like to see you prefect, Mr. Baroleanu, for the peasants to come and ask for your land. I am not discussing the issue in particular. I disregard that you are the owner and that I am doing politics. In fact, if sacrifices were needed, I'm sure that... But you're wrong! You're wrong, buddy. I will not make sacrifices! I will never agree to break up with an land to which I am connected by a past of difficulties, of pride and everything! For me, the land means life, not politics! You see, Dad. But as long as the land is into the hands of the tenants no renewal... You, Grigorita, speak like a sentimental woman with a high education in Leipzig. Old and honest appointments are all right. Not the tenants... today's politicians are ruining the world. Let's not exaggerate, Dad. Boyar Miron, I didn't mean... Grigorita, see what that gentleman in peasant clothes wants. He's the teacher, Dad. So you don't want to say... Leave them, Mr. Boiangiu. You don't say voluntarily.. ***! ***Leave them! The boyar! Kiss your hands, boyar.. Let them go home. Boyar, the boyar Miron.. If they say they didn't steal... I know, sir, they didn't steal I know, woe is me. I investigate But... the boyar Miron. He ordered me.. Now leave them alone. Aye, sir! He killed us for nothing, boyar! Have mercy on me too, boyar. Bogdaproste... May God give you health. Don't be careless, boyar because the day of judgment is near! And you'll be sorry you didn't listen And horsemen with swords will come to punish the world. Kiss your hand, boyar... What's the matter, boys? Beautiful day. Well, what have we done, folks? The boss is killing us and we don't have the courage to say a word to him? Damn you! What a mess! My brains were shaking! Welcome, my dears. Thank God! My dear, happy to see you! But you don't see me anymore. If your wife has a craving for strong emotions, she must find other clients, not me! Dear Alexandre, I would be old-fashioned, but take me by train. Ah, were you? I didn't even recognize you under this disguise. I took him to make my company more pleasant. You won't get mad, will you? Rudolf, be careful not to miss anything. Here's Alexander. Daddy! Finally! Welcome! Finally we've got you, beautiful and unsteady brat. I stay only two days, Daddy, but I'm sure I'm here for Christmas, I promise. Grig, dear, do you want to take care of Raul? Find him a room. He's just a stranger here. Come on, Florico! Come on! Florico, why didn't you come? I couldn't, Petrica. Dad is watching me. He said he'd hand you over to the gendarmes if... Florica.. Let's run. Where, Petrica? Where? Florico! Florico! What are you doing here? Signora... forgive me.. I'm Petre, a peasant from Amara I have a heart too and I would like to.. Signora, you are a woman and you understand. Have pitty.. I'll pay you as best I can. Give me two pogons of land (0,01 square km)! Why are you laughing, signora? Go away, before I denounce you! And me, who was thinking... Get in! Good morning, conasule. What can I do for you? Why do you think I called you, Florica? Are you afraid of me? Say it right. I didn't take any exams because of you. I don't want.. Will you tell me something, Daddy? Something very serious, Nadina. I heard you want to sell Babaroaia. I would buy it. Although I don't like doing family business, my dear daddy deserves an exception. Too good.. What is he doing, killing us? Don't be afraid, lady. Why didn't you go sledding with me? You wrapped your arms around his neck with such zeal as if... I didn't even realize it. I didn't mean it. Let it be, Balolene. Only you see that way because you are in opposition. I do politics, Prefect. I am obliged to see the reality, no matter how unpleasant it may be. No no. Something needs to change. What should it be? I don't know exactly. Well, it depends... It depends on the circumstances. The government must keep the right balance. Only this! This government? Yes. Bunch of weaknesses! You exasperate me. I can't stand it nomore. Why are you tormenting me? Be patient. Don't hug me like that! You promised me solemnly. I will wait for you, will you come? Yes. Shut up. To the table, welcome to the table! The rising star rises like a great mystery The star shines and proves... Carolers! Come see them! Happy Christmas! There you go, teacher. Come in and have a glass of wine with us. Come in! And the kids, of course. See, Mr. Baroleanu. it depends on how you plant love in people. I'm not member of any party, Mr. Prefect, just to keep my judgement free. But the country is boiling. I don't accuse you, director, but Baloleanu, because he is my rival, I can't admit being denigrated. Listen, sir... what's your name? Teacher... Dragos. That's it, Dragos. Tell me, you who live among the peasants, and you are of the people. But tell me sicerely. Is there peace and order around here? Or it's anarchy, as he claims. It's quiet, Prefect. We have peace and quiet. But there is also a lot of poverty. Poverty is not the responsibility of... It's Christmas and people no longer have corn... They are too indebted. So, what was I saying? And the government? What is the government doing? Hundreds of Moldavian peasants come to Bucharest. As long as they come, it means they still believe in something. When they don't come anymore... People don't help each other, that's it. When the so-called serious people proclaim that the peasants cannot live... how can the peasants respect the order? I live at my bank office but I have the impression that the peasant has embarked on an evolutionary process A process that could be fatal to us. What process? The peasant is just cunning, he drinks. What, now he wants to have corn, to have reserves, to play as he likes. Well, Daddy... peasants, land and land again and Christmas. I want to dance. Raul put on a waltz. Daddy, I invite you to the waltz. Are you satisfied, my love? Yes, but I'm very tired. You danced too much, but it's nothing. Good thing you're happy. Good night, my heart. Grighi..Vino! You are so cute.. Good night. Wait... wait a minute, please.. It's too late... Wait! You're leaving tomorrow. You were? I thought it was some servant. Whore! Grig, you beat me, my dear! I thought I'd be the first. What a sunny day! Who would have thought, after the snow tonight! You have a quarter of an hour. Hurry up. You leave at once for Bucharest. All right, but.. I mean, what do you mean, you're denying me credit? My dear, we are too old friends not to refuse you. Yes. Farewell. Daddy... But what happened? Daddy, when you come to Bucharest, stop by my place. Goodbye. Goodbye. All the best. What happened? I thought she wasn't to leave. I'm divorcing, Dad. Don't hit me! You wanted gentlemen, eh! Leave me, woman! ****! You f* with gentlemen! What is it, Lupule, what happened? What the hell happened to you? Don't hit me, father! Leave the girl, you're going to kill her! What did she do? You'll get tired of it! You know better, sir! Do you know where your son is? Ask him out to tell you! My son is in Bucharest for exams! Woe is me, but what did he do? What did he do? God should repay him, if not, the people will repay him. He raped my daughter! And I served you as a fool! Let it go, Lupule, these are the things of youth, it happened before... The world has not perished! It hasn't perished, boyar,and it will not perish THE WORLD! You look for another one to help you. Wait but.. God sees and judges! *** Special edition! Moldova on fire, the government is shaking.. Special edition! What is he shouting? Maybe is burning some place.. In Moldova What the hell of heat will be there? Take a newspaper. *** them lies! C'mon C'mon! Special edition! Stop giving money Here's the car, "sir". Here it is... Twenty-three. Come on, quickly. What are you doing here? To live..What do you want? Good morning, boyar. We come from Amara. We'd like to talk to the lady. Give this to us. Oh, my...right now? Please, be human, we come from afar. and our only hope is this. Yeah, well... Stay here. Can I help you with something, honey? No. We kiss your hand, lady.. I don't understand why you bothered. I told you clearly I'm not selling. What else do you want? And if I sell, I want money! And you don't have, so.. Lady, we could... We can... Yes! Well, go home and get to work. Yes, yes, sure... Minister, the situation is getting worse every day. It becomes unbearable. Exaggerate, exaggerate Baloleanule. Minister, now or never. Please forgive me... One moment. Aren't you from Amara? You are Petre! Well, didn't I take you in the carriage? Well, what wind brings you? So you know us. We would like to buy the lady's estate, but.. Folks, I'd help you... but I don't have time now. I have a reunion at the Parliament. I will defend your interests, you know. Wait for me at the Parliaament. When I'm done, we'll talk. You know where it is..We can handle it. How lucky we are! Curious kind of statement, Balolene! Excuse me, please. Yes, where is the Parliament? Good luck to us. The opposition wants to drown the country in blood! The opposition should be loyal to the government in these difficult times! The government.. Shame!.Huo.. Quiet, quiet. The government is not able to solve the peasant problem. The unrest affects the whole country and the government, instead of taking effective measures, reduces the petrol tax! Sir, what's your name, you have no say in this chamber! Every patriot in the country is in danger! He has to take a stand! Only an agrarian reform could reassure the peasants! The land must be given to the peasants! Shame! In the end, the opposition kisses the government! Land for the peasants! Freedom, equality, fraternity! The beels are tolling for vespers That gentleman forgot about us! We stay here for nothing. Why, Toadere? If he said to wait for him... I say to ask about him again, Seraphim. We don't ask anything more. Come on, f*** him, God forgive me! I'm frozen like a log.. I was right, teacher. Then we kind of finished it. Come on. F* him! It's not worth it. May rest in peace! May God forgive him! You make fun, also? You will be executed! What is it, sir, what did he do? So what he is an officer? Why he had hurt the man? The dead man is a landholder from Moldova, Colonel Stefanescu. He was killed by the peasants of the estate. Yes? Where, sir? In Moldova, near Dorohoi. So why he had to be beaten? Somebody of them must be killed, so you'll see how they learn. Shut up, I ****! Go away from here, all of you! You beat me without mercy.. Shut up! That's the justice in the Romanian country (Valahia)! Shut up! They rip off seven skins from us and they beat us, also! Take care, I'll take you to the police, they'll soften your bones! Everybody move! Get away! The pe-ople from old vil-la-ges ri-bel-led and burned the man-sions.. That's it.. Nothing will change until we get our hands on the ax... Shut up, Seraphim, shut up! Eh, what's the matter? Look, I came and I'm here to ask you what's wrong with you. We work, we work, and.. We can not stand any longer, with the old agreements, boyar. That's enough, boyar! It's too much for us... Stop it! Talk one by one, we are not in a fair! Talk, what about the agreements? On whose behalf do you want to talk to? On behalf of the villagers, Mr. luga. Did they charge you? No, but my conscience dictated it to me. Then put an end to it. I don't need your intercession to find out what my people want. Mediators like you are the nuisance of the peasants. They poison their simple souls. They disturb their lives. Please believe me.I.. Enough! I have nothing more to say to you. Others should talk. And you, put your mind to it. I will not pray for anyone. And if you will ask me, I will not give in. Sign the agreements as they are, because they are good. Go! The land should be worked if these bastards wouldnt resist the agreements. Dad, you should intervene for the teacher. I mean, to humiliate myself in front of the peasants? There's no humiliation, Dad. Dragos did not commit any crime that... Your Dragos is the instigator of my peasants. What you did in the city he did in the village. Dragos is indispensable in the village at the moment. Only he would be able to restrain the instincts of... The brake is me, Gregory, not anyone else. I didn't mean to upset you. But don't you read the newspapers? Bucharest is horrified by what is happening in Moldova. Not only did they set fire to mansions, they also killed several tenants. Live with your feet on the ground, Dad! The country is burning and you want to buy estates! You never understood me, my dear. You didn't even understand that. Your father does not give in to anyone and only bows before God. Then all I have to do is leave as I came? I think so. Besides, Nadina is coming too. Dad, why did you call her? But what, she got the plague? If you're divorcing... Not because of it, Dad, but... You're exaggerating, as always. Return quietly to Bucharest and let me defend my land. As long as I live, that's my duty. You, Luca. Don't you believe me? I saw with my own eyes! All the mansions, by order of Voda (the king)... Get away from here! All the mansions between Rosiori and Alexandria burned down! Voda could no longer bear the boyars! He put others in their place! Even these they befriend with the generals! To kill the poors! Why are you listening the madman? Which Voda's command? Good day, sir! What are the people waiting for, Ichime? Not even them know what they're waiting for. They are fools. Neica(big brother), Shut up! Get out. Mother is sick. God, Petrica! I'm afraid you'll get hurt. You get involved in everything. I don't get involved, Mother. But if people call me, I have to go. I would be ashamed to do nothing. Petre! Take care of the chid. Shut up, Mom. You'll be with Florica? She's not to blame. She's not to blame. Suddenly I saw two white riders coming. I also saw the riders in Ruginoasa. Dressed in white as the snow, and with swords. Overseas. They sent us from Bucharest to let the people know. To drive away the boyars and tenants, to set fire to the mansions! He who does not obey the command.. "Green leaf of mandrake, joy doesn't foretell happiness." Hello, yes, station Amara. The boss. Are you, Badescule? It's quiet here, but there? What, they set the mansion on fire? Which one? In Vlasca? It's not that far. All right, all right, I'll take care of it! All the best! Look! Take a look yourself! What do you want, sister? Leave me alone, we have issues! Mr. Mayor, Mr. Prefect is coming to inspect. Why did the lady and the prefect come? Why?Look why! To sell the estate to him! What's up, Petre? What's the matter? Sir, stop it with Babaroaga. What, man, but what happened? You know what. Well, folks, I don't get in, I don't get involved. If you take it, I... Well, that's why! Don't interfere! Why not? Because we are soft and scared! If they knew we took their money would they still dare? If we continue to behave cowardly like then... But we better set them on fire! I confess to you, Mr. Prefect, I don't trust it, but if you believe... Dle luga, important e.. I don't want to seem inflexible. Yes, Mr. luga. In the face of imminent danger, the duty of all Romanians, is to... Kiss your hands, boyar! Here it's still quiet! What did the boyar Miron speak with the prefect? Good luck, glad to meet you, guys! Good day, Mr. Prefect. Kiss your hands, sir Miron! Are you the mayor? Oh, yes, I know you. Is it quiet around here? Everything is in order? Bravo, that's how I like it, boys! Bravo! Make way... This way, Mr. Miron. Yes, doesn't matter.. Once again, glad to meet you! Brothers, you know that opinca (the peasant's shoe) is the sole of the earth. The government is defending your holy work. The Romanian peasant is good and hardworking and the king and the government take care of you. We came for reconciliation, that's why we brought Mr. Miron luga! TTo reach a great peace! With him, we will see, Mr. Prefect! But now it's time of the revolt, the people want some land because they have none! Everyone grabs a peace of land where the fire passes! There are enough estates that the boyars have renounced and others keep them! Just to squeeze money out of our work and make fun of us! We can live in peace, but give us land! Land?Where from? Which land? But why did you come here with the lady? To sell you the land? Why he came?To rape our children? Shut up, you! She must go where she came from, to her "ciocoi"! What does she think... Shut up! Take your hand off me! What am I, your mouth? Why are you getting your hands on him? Look, children, you have upset the boyar! How's that possible? Stay well and be calm! Make room! Come on, move! Get out of here! Where is that one going? At Babaroaga. Beware, come on! Beware he's coming! Rudolf! Rudolf, get the car ready. We're leaving immediately. I can't start, miss! The magnet broke! But I say it wasn't good you to leave at night, on the road... Sleep here in Babaroaga. Don't worry, nothing will happen. The prefect spoke to the people. I'm telling you the truth, at first I was scared,too. No. I want to leave immediately. I don't want to sleep here tonight. Why, lady? Our people are quiet. I know them. Besides, you don't even have a train until tomorrow morning. Who is it? Open! What is it? Ruginoasa is burning! Oh, my! Mr. Chief! Look, sir! What are we doing, Mayor? How do I know? Let's see! Let's go to Ruginoasa! Let's drop a cart! Good evening,.. Uncle Busuioc, open, the clinents are coming. Do you like it? It seems to me Christian people, that the revolution has come! That can't be... it's like an island. Stop, you! Where are you going, boss? The duty...What duty? To beat the people! Have you heard it? Run away! Come on, f*** them! Let's go to Babaroaga! Come on, hurry up, give me something to wear! Go after Cosma. Go and look for a carriage, a cart or something else... God, Holy Mother! Leave him alone, people! Don't hurt him! What do you want to do to him? Kill me, but don't harm him! Stay put, little rooster, we will castrate you! You won't jump anymore on people's daughter and wives. Decorate him! Put them on his chest! Don't move! Don't scream! Don't move, lady Don't move, lady, if not I'll kill you! You made fun of me, why won't I do the same? Leave me! Go away, you devil! God forgive me! Come on, help yourselves, brothers! Pour in it.. Mother! Mother, look. Good food, you will see how quickly you will feel better. Mother.. Mother! Oh, my.. I hope you aren't dead.. God forgive you, Mom Yes, I see that all the village is here. Who called you here to ruin my garden? Couldn't you wait in the backyard? Or now you became boyars since you talk about revolution and misdeeds? But now if you are here, what else do you say? It is the order of the voda, boyar, to take the land. and those who won't obey... Well, are you listening these fairy tales, guys? Politicians talk for nothing and you believe them. You're crazy, kids. Stop, boyar, we didn't get up like that for nothing. You shut up, thief! Why should I shut up, I'm your servant? You call me "you"?(disrespectful) Get out of my yard right away!" I won't leave. Are you facing me? You don't have a yard anymore. Wait, I'll show you, thief! Get out of here at once, or you will get out on the stretcher! Listen, boyar. I'm not going out. Try if you dare. God has satiated him of land. Petre! Come on, they are killing the old man, the boyar! My father sent me. Go away! Where is the boyar? Indoors. Is he dead? Isn't it enough that you have killed him, you don't even let him rest in peace? Nea Luca, at least you be more reasonable! Mind your own bussiness! Don't make damages, people! Brother.. What are you doing here? Run home! This girl's shame! What, are you crazy too? You have nothing to look for here! Get out of here! Get out! What is it, Toadere? Look at her..how she makes fun of us.. Kill her! That's it, Petrica! What are you doing, brothers? Burn it all! Congratulations, my dear. You take over as prefect in such moments... I congratulate you, though. I wanted to welcome you here, in the heart of the county, so hard.. Griguta, who would have thought that the worst would happen at Amara... Do you know anything exactly? Please don't... ... Nothing exactly. Let's hope nothing bad. My dear ones, we are living the most terrible tragedy in the history of the Romanian nation. Hang up. I am in possession of the reform manifesto. An excellent pacifying weapon. When the peasants began to revolt for the land they will hardly be satisfied with Platonic reforms. Don't you think that it would be possible for your estates to be divided? Now... I don't. You thought so. One is an intimate belief at some point and another is the possibility of its realization. What a terrible dilemma. However, the reforms.. I doubt the effectiveness of the current reforms. To love the peasants doesn't mean to tolerate their robberies! Prefect, we're ready, we can start! I hope what I heard is not true, Mr. luga. Please forgive me. Yes, yes. Are you going in the direction of Amara? Unfortunately, first to Rociu My painful.. ...duty. What is it? No, it seemed to me. I'm horrified that these peasants might one day be organized. Ahh ("Nonsense") Congratulations from the bottom of my heart, my dear. You are a young prefect. We were opponents. But now... What? What is this? Who ordered the shooting? They fired, as a precaution. Look at them, you see them standing? Avoid them. Don't stir them up. The peasants are enough trouble for me. Do you want to create a conflict? Do you know that they went on strike in Pascani? They didn't get on the locomotives. We replace them with the military. With the military? And who will lead the troop train? We must force them by force of arms. Are they coming? Hold it. They are coming. What are we going to do? What, are you scared? Why didn't you stay at home? Why did you rebel against the boyars? Or did you think that the boyars were doing nothing and will let us take their estates? If even Voda is lying... then he's a pig! We show them! You haven't listened the one who teaches you well, and now... Everyone, young and old, should go to the head of the village. But not with empty hands. Let everyone take what they find. A scythe, an ax, a fork, something. Land for free is impossible to find. Either you pay it with money or with something else. It's not possible without payment. From now on, it's God will. Let them come, we are waiting for them! Unfold! Calm down, Captain. Let's not lose our temper. As you wish, Prefect. But you see them, you can convince yourself that they deserve nothing else but... Calm down, sir. First I must.. I hope your soldiers are safe. The Romanian soldier executes the order. Nothing else. Let's finish them,****! Trumpet! Trumpet! Follow me! What shoul we do, Nicolae? What, loane? Our duty. Which one wants to miss the target? Which one, because I'm in the mood to hit him! Sergeant, put the cannons in position! Bastards soldiers! Shame on you! I'm not afraid of your rifles! Shoot! Look here! Shoot! Don't shoot this woman, because the boyar killed her husband! She's crazy! She doesn't know what she's saying! Go away, the time has come! People need to know the truth! Prefect, you don't hear the urges to disobey, don't you hear? How dare you to raise your voice? You obey my orders, not me, yours! Trumpet next to me, trumpet! Back! No! No! Let's not let them her kill, brothers! Attack them! The robbers are attacking the platoon, you see, Mr. Prefect. All right, but.. Still, the manifesto.. What manifesto? Get away of here! They are not allowed to shoot at people! Don't be afraid, old man. Me? ...old man Luca. Go home, woman! Don't give up, brothers! Captain.. The peasants are attacking us. Can't you see, sir? Trumpet! Fire sounds! Load weapons! Fire warning! Fire! They shot at us, brothers. There is sound of rifles! On them! Fire! What are you doing? Brothers! Don't run, brothers! Don't run! Don't run, brothers! Petre!
