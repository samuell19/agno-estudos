(Upbeat tropical music) What a hot cookie. [Voiceover] So sexy. (Girls laughing) He's so delicious. (Girls moaning) A little faster gals, I'm starting to get a crust. Don't you wanna join us in the cabana? Thank toots, but I'm not feelin' it. Oh, are you feeling a bit crummy? Just thinkin', if it weren't for that stupid floozy At that bakery who turned me into this, I'd be blowin' custard all over all three of ya. (Girls laughing) Look at me, I'm shootin' flour here. Don't be so down on yourself. I've been sitting on my lard for far too long. I promised my momma that I'd finish what I started. And I never lie to Mama. It's high time that I find that gal And cut her down to size. But how ya gonna find her? What's this? Huh. Holy shit! [Voiceover] Who is it? It's that bitch that turned me into this Tasty shell of a man. What are ya gonna do when you find her? I'm gonna fuckin' kill her! That's awesome! (Girls laughing) You're the best cookie! [Voiceover] He's so hot! (Suspenseful music) (String grunting) Would ya stop gruntin' all over the merch, man? That shit costs money. Man, that shit's heavy! You are wheezin' like a beaver, bro Frazier. You sure you're cut out for this gig? You aren't payin' me. You are doin' a great job, dude. Just be careful with the goods. All this shit is comin' outta my own pocket. How could I forget, you sound like a broken record. Take it down a notch, Tarzan, you are at a nine And I need ya at a six. Fuck off! That is blatant insubordination right there, Which is how an uprising starts. Smack talk leads to black helicopters, And the ape resistance is never far behind. Man, I've been workin' my ass off all day Without so much as a break! Handlin' all this beautiful merchandise. It's a shame none of it's ever been tested first. Well, we don't sell used merchandise. All right, say I'm a paying customer And I wanted to buy this right here, and I promised A couple hot ass bitches to get 'em flyin'. Then it's all plugged up, don't even work! Then they bring it back as defective. Dude, it's more than defective man, I didn't get laid because of you. You wanna get a rap as a cock blocker? You got a good point, you don't have the hooch, Ya don't get the pooch. (Lighter fires) Give me some of that before I revolt. (String inhaling) (String coughing) You are a beast with that bong. Cool it down man, you're gonna start a tornado in here. This is how I let society keep the boot around my neck. Otherwise, I'd be a rager emerged world. Incredibly creepy. What's all the commotion out here? Your body is a wonderland. We're just settin' up shop out here. Looks like it. (Music of wonderment) Ya know, if that mail away business course Taught me anything, rewarding employees Begets higher profits. He looks rewarded, doesn't he? Pull my string baby. Maybe not so much with the happy from now on, Lerno. Yeah, might've been a bit overzealous. Just a tad, but you always have the best of intentions Which is why you're going to be a huge success. Thanks. (Psychedelic music) Those fairies are a good idea for the shop, bro. Employee discount! - We'll talk about it. - Yeah! [Larnell] How's the office lookin'? Everything is in its place, and the computer Is all set up. Thanks tiny dancer, ya know I couldn't do this without ya. Hey, you did all the heavy lifting, I'm just here to help. Speaking of, how'd you get into the business anyways? Well, that's a long story. And a really messed up one. Tellin' ya, they should make a movie about this shit. It all started when I was a worker drone, like yourself. Not a business man like I am now, but we'll get to that. (Upbeat rap music) Large bong for sale, originally purchased In the 1960's in New Orleans. Recently deceased owner claims it was possessed. [Larnell] My best buds and I were slackers right, Always gettin' stoned and buyin' Stupid crap off the Internet, then one day We get this knock on the door, And the best worst package of our lives showed up. Are you Larnell? What do you want, bro? Package for ya. Larnell, perhaps it's the item? [Larnell] Item. You've been waiting for? Item I've been waiting for. Yeah, that's it. It's the item you've been waiting for. (Upbeat rap music) [Larnell] It was beautiful, man. And then, it turned into a nightmare. You won't believe it dude, but that bong was evil. It was an evil freakin' bong. It's name, Ebee, and she was a nasty bitch. Once you smoke from it, ya get taken into the Bong World, where your deepest desires come true. Only it turns your desires against you. (Man groaning) Monkey. (Static) (Disembodied whispers) (Rock music) [Ebee] Welcome honey, welcome, make yourself at home. (Voice laughing) We have everything here that you desire. Goth boobs, huh? That's cool, that's cool. (Skulls growling) Oh that feels good. (Man screaming) It's the bong, man, it's evil. Well if it's dangerous, then why'd you Put it up for sale? I didn't put it up for sale, man. My wife, she sold it man, I had it in storage. She sold all my shit, man. Sold my Hot Wheels collection, man I miss those little cars. How do we stop it? Stop what? The bong? I don't think it can be stopped, man. [Ebee] I could take him with my Hands tied behind me, come on, come on! You know you not gonna win, Jimbo baby! Yeah, but I ain't gonna lose either. Put this in your pipe, you evil bitch. No, no, no! (Bomb explodes) I can't believe we got outta there alive. I got so high once, I woke up in a zoo. They kept feedin' me so I stayed there for a week. (Man laughs) Nice work. Well I haven't even gotten to the good stuff yet. (Mystical music) Hey, any of you dingle berries know where we are? I think maybe we took a wrong turn at the river. Dude, we took a wrong turn at Kimona, This was the dumbest idea. No, it wasn't. Look, in order to cure your afflictions, We need to research the bong's origins, We need to find where Jimbo bought the bong, In order to do that, we need to find where he was Serving in the peace corps in the 60's. Ah, cannibal chick! Who are you guys, and what do you want? We, my name is Allister and we're from California. We seem to be a bit lost, Miss... Felicity. [Larnell] We thought we were rid of Ebee for good, But like a bad buzz she came back with a vengeance. But when it came to King Bong, she was a sweetheart. Oh man, it's the evil fuckin' bong. Who put her back together? Well, it's good to see you too. Welcome to the jungle, mofo! Look, there's another one of 'em. Glad you took that dick out yo ass so you could see me! It's amazing, it appears to have been here for centuries! Oh but I still got it, suga! Let me know if you ever want a little taste of this, hmm? This bong can talk too, just like the other one? Don't let him play ya girl, he ain't All he's talked up to be. [Larnell] And I haven't even mentioned The Poontang Tribe. Must be the Poontang Tribe. I'll say! Oh, you don't understand, there's never been any proof That they ever existed. No one's ever seen them before. (Man screaming) OK girls. (Laser beam shooting) (man screaming) [King Bong] Oh yeah. Ah, what happened to the delivery dude? He's right there, on the floor. Come on now girls, show 'em what you're workin' with. Help, I'm a fuckin' doobie! [Both] He's tiny! Now! Ah! Wait, what the hell is goin' on over here? Wait a minute, what is that! Boy, you'd better give me that necklace back, Don't you touch that necklace. You know how much money I spent on that shit. You better not, boy, ow why you gotta, Boy I will whoop your monkey ass, do you understand me? Don't you hit me again, please don't hit me! Please, I'm gonna have to kill you! Ow, Mama! Somebody please! (Bong mumbling) (Bong exploding) You left one thing out of your story. They were skanks? We are so done talking about them. Yip! Your grandpa, don't forget about him, God rest his soul. Oh, I've been tryin' to forget about gramps, But not enough good weed in the world can do that. Hey now, he played an important part in all of this. He sure did, that insulting old turd. (Bright twinkling) What the fuck are you doing here? Well if that's the way you're gonna play it Then that's on a need to know too. What you need to know, sonny boy, Is that if your ensy weensy teeny little penis Was a worm on a hook, it wouldn't feed a God d*#* guppy! Hey, how 'bout I just leave you two to your Little love fest here, OK? Who was it summoned the good doctor? That'd be me, Gramps. [Grandpa] You? Actually Gramps, we kinda need your help. The only help you're likely to get from me Is a retroactive abortion. [Larnell] He's the one who led us Into that jungle in the first place. I have it all under control, Earth. (Laughs) Shit, Larnell was right, these aliens are Gonna totally work us over! [Larnell] And then that alien bong fell to Earth, And he thought he could use it to take over The world's weed business. (Man making karate noises) [Alien Bong] Oh, I feel that something is amiss. No, no, no! (Electric noises) (Bong exploding) We barely got outta there alive, again. Yeah, but if it wasn't for your gramps, We would never have met. Every rose has its freakin' thorn, man. That's the biggest crock of shit I've ever heard, man. Alien bongs, king bongs, evil bongs... Insubordination... Eat a dick, Dick! The hardest part to believe is you got friends. Where are they, call 'em up. Well, we don't talk about them anymore. Hey baby, why don't ya go out with a real man? Once you go small, you're never gonna go tall. You are the worst employee ever, freak! How am I gonna build an empire on your shoulders? You're not. OK, while you two lovebirds sort this out, I've got a real job to go to. Oh, don't go yet babe. I'll come back after work. (Sighs) That's cool, but bein' the boss Is a lot tougher than I thought. Hey, keep your eye on the prize. Big profits, big future, big ring! The biggest. You know, we've never really talked about it, But I am so glad that evil bong is nowhere to be found. Oh yeah, it's long gone. I don't know if it was destroyed Or lost to time and space, but I'm just glad that it's gone. And I hope it stays that way. Of course it's gonna stay that way, I mean Why wouldn't it, she is gone for good, totally gone. Never gonna come back. Are you OK? Yeah, perfect, perfect, I am perfect. Completely fine. You're acting weird. Well that's what studs act like. OK, I'll see ya later. Love you. Love you dude. (Sighs) She makes me wanna touch myself. (Suspenseful music) (Bell rings and door opens) (Door closes) (Slow drum beat) Well it's time to make some greenbacks, Tarzan. Now listen, I want ya to keep an eye on Those two morphodites. Why? Well, to my trained eye, they look like People of nefarious taste. Check it out. That's nice. To my untrained eye, they're in a head shop, And they're your only customers all day. See, this is why I'm the big boss man. Watch and learn Romeo. Phase one is to make the customers believe Ya have a superior product. Knucks. So what the hell are you two lookin' for? We were maybe in the market to procure a, Like bong or somethin'. Well freaks, I'm sorry to tell you that you are In the wrong place for such dubious treasures. We don't sell bongs, we are solely in the business Of selling water pipes. (Scoffs) Cut the shit, Dick. My name's not Dick, that's just the name of the dude Who used to run this place. I am the new purveyor of this establishment, And my name's Larnell. Whatever, people don't use these things To blow bubbles, we wanna score a gnarly bong, And we wanna blaze our future away, man.

Easily arranged. Every time I see you, it's a giant pain in my ass. Oh, I assure you, my friend, I have changed my ways. I've heard that tune before, man. It sucked the first time, really blew the second time, And the third time was total butt vomit. I have learned from my past mistakes. Really, because the last time I saw you, You were a priest. That was a momentary lapse of reason. Are you aware that it's frowned upon to Grow weed at a monastery? Fuckers, the sacred plant is God's gift For bad days and ass holes. That's what I said, and apparently it's a huge no no Selling it out of confessionals. Total buzz kill. Fact. I don't care man, OK? I'm movin' on and I'm not lookin' back. You and I are more alike than you think, my friend. I too am a business man. He's a travelin' salesman. That's true, and the outdoors is my office. Well then, why don't you go back to your office? There's the door. Hey, give me a minute, would ya? I didn't know this was your store when I walked into it. And a fine store it is, too. Where are the other guys? Yeah, where are they?

Yeah, Larnell, you're doin' good, you're gonna do good, You're already doin' good, look at this place! Ya know, you may be interested in what your Old friend Rabbit has in this case. Maybe, but probably not. But, for old times sake, you've got exactly one minute. Go. (Sinister music) Whoa. Dude. That's Ebee. That's right, all handcrafted, branded, Official merchandise based on that damn evil bong. But you don't own the rights to Ebee. Does it really matter? Ya know, really? It's not like she's really around. I gotta admit it's some really gnarly merch. Yep, told ya. You won't find this anywhere else, my friends. I'm the sole maker, supplier, distributor In the Western Hemisphere of the known universe, That's a pretty wide area of penetration, If I do says so myself. And I even have a few trademarks in the works. So you're keeping all the profits for yourself. Yes, I mean no. Ya know Larnell, it was Kizmit That I walked into your store today. Maybe, but probably not. Every time I see you Rabbit, it's like I'm getting Finger blasted in my ass hole with a razor blade. Let me make it up to ya, Larnell, here. A little medicine for Papa? Let's see here. It's all sticks and skunk, man. It's worthless. It's still got a good kick to it. You're not gettin' anything in my shop Unless ya pay for it. Well, I wish there was something I could, You were always kind of goodish to me. Well that cookie looks pretty tasty. That cookie looks pretty tasty, Rabbit. (Rabbit moaning) My groin's all tingly. (Laughs) I can't believe I'm sayin' this about a cookie but, That is one sexy lookin' cookie. Ya know where I can get one? It's a brand new bakery down the street, Dough Re Mi Bakery, it's run by this real hot chick. She reminded me of Luann. Oh whoa, didn't ya read the sign, man? Every time I hear that chick's name it's like A bad acid trip. Sorry Larnell. Did you come back into my life just to torture it, huh? It's just been a long day, man, all I can think about Are those damn cookies. Where was that place again? It's close by, you can walk there. All right shoestring, now I want ya to Man the joint, OK? Keep an eye on this guy. Don't let him touch anything or do anything. Rabbit, now I want ya to sit in that back room And not do anything. Don't touch anything, don't say anything, kapish? You don't have to worry about me! Famous last words. (Door opens and closes) (People talking) (Curious music) What can I get ya? What one's the hardest one to reach? Huh? Huh? Oh nothing, uh, uh, uh... I want this one. No! Not that one! I really had my heart set on this one right here. No! Not that one. They're all the same. No they're not. This one's much better. Okie Doke. Oh that's it, that's the one. I can't seem to get my hands on it. Oh you will, just keep tryin'. (Man moaning) Oh, hey! Oh! Hey, I told you the other day to get outta here And I meant it! Got it! We're cool. Next time I see you, I'm callin' the cops. Yeah, get out! (Door opens) I can't believe some people. (Door shuts) That was really hard core of you though, I mean I've never seen you bark like that at somebody before. Believe me, the old me would've never talked like that. Certain things in life changes you. If you don't mind my asking, what was the turning point? I don't like to talk about it. But, let me just say, that it taught me life's a gift, And it's far too short to take crap from anybody. You have to stand up, stick up, and fight for what's right If you're gonna make it in this world. Because nobody is gonna do it for you. Whoa you sounded just totally like the Terminator! (Women laugh) Oh, and speaking of moving up in the world... (Woman laughs) The paper came. I haven't read it yet, I wanted you to read it first. Front page of how great the bakery is? Can you believe it? Best in the city! Well, what's it say? Nothing, it's just a stupid article. Bake for her life, blah, blah, blah. Dough Re Mi, yea! Lone survivor of the serial killer Millard Findelmeyer? That's you? I'm so irritated at that stupid reporter. She said she wouldn't mention that part of my life. Just focus on the bakery. Well ya have to admit, I mean, it's a Pretty good sellin' point. You're a celebrity! Come on, tell me the whole story, I mean, There is always more. I just really wanna forget about The whole thing, really, OK? I'll never bring it up again, pinky swear. I always loved diners, and I dreamed of owning one On my own at one point, Until that day. (Sparkling music) And I'm required to do what my mother always taught me, And that's to finish what I started. And I'm not gonna kill ya, but I have to honor my mother. (Suspenseful music) Can't, Mother. Ah! (gun fires) Ah! [Sarah] I gave up the diner dream, of course. My mom and I, we opened up a small bakery instead. It also says here, that after they fried him In the chair, they cremated him, and sent his Ashes to his mother in Coonsboro. How sick is that! [Sarah] Somehow he came back as a cookie, And he killed all my friends and family. (Electricity sparking) (Disembodied whispers) (Gingerdead man laughing) But I got him in the end. That's my story, that's who I am today. Whoa, that explains the funky gingerbread cookies. They're about your real story with that psycho. I struggled for years to get that outta my life. Finally I just decided to own him. Ya know, it's a part of me. When life gives you lemons, I make gingerbread men. You are a freakin' super hero. I am not a hero. (Laughs) I'm just somebody who did the right thing. But you're normal. I mean, most of the time you meet survivors and, You know, they're not like you. What, they wear capes and utility belts? No but, ya know, like they get all messed up, And then they walk around smellin' like cat pee. I was almost the cat pee lady, I couldn't bake for years. I couldn't even be around flour or eggs without Freaking out, and then one day, something just changed. Like, a switch was flicked. And I realized that life has to go on. I got Millard in the end, and if I stop livin' my life Because of him, that means that he would've won. Heavy. Don't make a big deal about it, I'm over it! I just want the world to enjoy my cookies. Well, if that's your goal, then maybe you should've Started with that perv back there. Hey! (Women laughing) All I know is that Millard Findelmeyer is dead, OK? He won't be bothering anybody anymore. (Crowds talking) Hey, how's it goin'? Good, how can I help you? Name's Larnell, I actually own a store Right down the street and I was hopin' maybe we could Talk some business, but first, I have gotta get One of those cookies. Awesome. So fuckin' good.

(Rabbit humming) Larnell said don't touch anything. (Laughs) Larnell said don't say anything. (Laughs) Oh maybe he's right, I can't control my urges. Well screw you Larnell, some stallions can't be fenced in. I'll show you skunk and sticks. (Ebee mumbling) I knew this was good, I'm hearing the angels.

Go on and get outta here so I can get to killin' already! So I was sayin' that I own this store down the street. Ya know, I'm thinkin' that your bakery and my store Might have a little synergistical chemistry. Ya know, maybe we can do a little cross-promotionalization? Somethin' to kinda help us both out? How's that? Well, seems like your bakery is in the business Of curing the munchies, while my store is in the Business of providing the munchies, so to speak. What kinda store do you say you own again? Ya know Dick Head Shop? I mean, Dick's Head Shop, that one. Is that the one in the empty space next to the eyesore? No, I actually own the eyesore. Oh, I'm sorry, that is not my thing. Look, I promise you it'll be worth your time, OK? I've totally turned things around, it's actually Pretty nice inside, all classy and shit. I don't know.
