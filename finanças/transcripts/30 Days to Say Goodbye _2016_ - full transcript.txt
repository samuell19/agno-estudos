[MUSIC PLAYING] I had to take Jack to the doctor today. Jack's my son. He has a rash. Turns out he's allergic to our cat. Well-- my husband's cat. [SIGH] The doctor gave him a prescription because we can't get rid of that cat. My husband loves that cat. We got it when we first got married. I wanted to have kids right away, but he said, let's get an animal, and see how we deal with that first. Of course I was OK with it, because I thought he was going to get a dog. But when he came home, he just had this kitten perched on his shoulder, like a bird. I asked him, why didn't you get a dog? He just looked at me and he said, I didn't choose the cat The cat chose me. [MUFFLED SOB] And he smiled. He has the most beautiful smile you can say no to. Jack has a smile. Our daughter, Morgan, has his eyes. Mr. Walsh, we're doing everything we can to make him comfortable. You're just waiting for him to die. How can you still think he's going to die, after what happened? Alex, there's no evidence of cognitive functioning. Don't you fucking dare say that to me. He's alive inside. You took him from me! Alex, you need to listen to Doctor Roberts! You weren't there. You didn't see it. He was with me! Alex, he is my brother! This is hard for me, too. [CRYING] I'm sorry. [CRYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Jim called again-- Dad. I didn't answer. I don't know if he's truly sorry, or if he's just lonely because mom is not around. It's that's time again, Mr. Walsh. I'm staying with him tonight. Oh, you'll have to clear that with Dr. Roberts. I already did. We want to see if we get another spark out of him. I hope you do. Easy. Dad, why are you so sad? I'm-- I'm sad because of your daddy. Hey, you. Time to wake up. James! Hi. I hope I didn't miss our anniversary. No, it's still a few weeks away. Great, man. Stay right here. I have a surprise for you. James, wait! [TIRES SQUEAL] [CRASH] James! What'd they tell you at the hospital? Which hospital are you referring to? The one the ambulance took him, where they stabilized him and then kicked him out because he was gay? Would it be the second hospital, where they wouldn't accept my insurance, because they don't recognize our marriage? They didn't say much, other than my husband's mostly dead. So after they decided that he'd never speak to me again or acknowledge our children again, we're here. Sorry, Mr. Walsh. Sometimes these things can be mishandled. Unfortunately, that does not change the fact that patients with as severe brain damage as your husband's simply do not recover. People worse off make a full recovery. They didn't even give him a chance. They just decided he wasn't worth saving. James's catatonic state is not psychosomatic. It's um-- not reversible. His brain is severely damaged. And it is ceasing to function. Whatever time he has left, rest assured that our staff are here for him, and hospice, and to help you with, um-- this time of difficult transition. Difficult transition? This would be the time to get things in order, OK? To spend time with your family. In the meantime, we'll take James out every day for fresh air and sunshine. There's a park bench-- overlooks a beautiful park. It's very peaceful. What did he say? Will they take James? They will. Oh, thank God. I'm going to go check on him I talked to my parents today. What's wrong? They're going to fight you for Jack and Morgan. The fuck they are! No one's taking my kids away from me. Look, I am on your side, OK? But they have a case. Your marriage isn't recognized by the state. And the twins share his DNA. For a reason. It doesn't matter what the reason was. They think the twins will have a better life living with them. They don't want to remove you from their lives-- as If that makes what they're doing OK. He's still alive, and they're already trying to pull this family apart. You know, I was good enough for their son, but not a grieving faggot trying to raise their grandchildren! [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR OPENS ] Mr. Walsh? Mr. Walsh? Alex. Alex, why aren't you outside with James? His sister and the kids are out there with him. I figured they wanted some alone time. May I? Please. I'll be out of here in just a minute. Take your time. It'd be nice to talk to someone who hasn't been crying for nearly a month. Oh, well, you should have seen me when I first started this job. I cried every day. Not anymore? Only on special occasions, ha. I guess you see this kind of stuff all the time. No, I don't. Everybody's different. You have a beautiful connection with James. Not everybody has that. You two were lucky to have found each other-- a true romance. I met James at a crossroad in my life, just after I got out of the military. It was very romantic. Well, hellooo. You are cute. I actually hadn't come out, prior to meeting him. I was always afraid to. But he made it worth it. He's made my life better than I ever thought it could be. Did you know you were gay before you met him? Oh, I've always known. I just spent my entire life hiding it from everybody. You know, during the time I was in the military, it wasn't easy to be a gay man. And the thought of disappointing my parents was heartbreaking. And how did your parents take it? Whoo-- about how I expected. This is some kind of sick joke, right? Dad, this isn't a joke. Where did I go wrong? You didn't do anything wrong. I told you. I told you you hugged him too much! Now he's condemned to hell-- condemned to hell! What will people say? [CRYING] You need to get out of my house. You need to get out of my house. Dad, I'm still your son! Bullshit. Stop it! You made your choice. ALEX: It's not a choice! Get out! Mom, please. FATHER: Get out! Dad-- Get out of my goddamn house. You've chosen to be a stain on this family's name. I will not have a cocksucker for a son. Oh! Ah, ha-- what, is that that faggot you're going to hell for? Is that the faggot you're going to hell for? Well, fuck you, and that AIDS-infested faggot. I hope you both burn in hell. Say faggot one more time. Faggot. Oh! It's not worth it. FATHER: Ah-- you are my greatest regret! I no longer have a son. Don't ever come back here! You're dead to me. Dead to me! Mom! I take it you don't know too many gay people. So-- they've never met their grandkids? They didn't even know they had grandchildren until just before my mother died. She died having never met them. And I don't speak to my dad. Ever? Well, he's been trying to reach out ever since James-- I can-- I can understand not wanting to add to what you're going through already. But I've noticed, when people come to love and accept family-- regardless of whether they deserve it-- well, it tends to be easier on them. James actually forgave him. He took the kids to meet him last year. He'd say, it's easier to forgive and move forward than to hurt and hold onto the past. It's what makes James the most beautiful person I've ever known. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SOBBING] I'm sorry. Hey, listen-- did I upset you? No, no, you-- [CRYING] James. You look just like my husband. He's the most wonderful man I've met in my life. We have-- [CRYING] Two of the most beautiful children you could ever imagine. James, this is me. It's Alex. [CRYING] Alex? Yes. If you see Alex-- [INAUDIBLE] [CRYING] James. Tell-- tell him I'll always be with him. OK. [CRYING] Tell him-- tell him to let our kids know that no matter what they do in life, they'll always be our greatest accomplishments. You-- you can tell them. You can tell them that yourself when you come home. [CRYING] James. Alex? Yes! [INAUDIBLE] Oh, James, James. [SOBBING] It's test time, James-- just some simple tests. He's OK. He was speaking to me. Mr. Walsh, hopefully the tests will confirm that. The sooner we get started, the better. Where are you taking him? [INAUDIBLE] James, James! [MUSIC PLAYING] You would have liked James. Some for you, some for me. Cheers. Cheers. Mmm. Oh, that's tasty. Let's have some for the dogs. Yeah. Some for you, some for you, some for you, and a tiny bit for you, [INAUDIBLE].. I'll be right back, baby. OK, Daddy. OK. Hey, buddy, go play with your sister for a little bit. How did you get daddy, and I got stuck with dad? Because I thought of it. [CHUCKLING] Big day next month. Yeah, what's that? I bet you thought I'd forget. Wait-- did you forget? I didn't forget. [CHUCKLING] I hope you didn't make any plans, because I got us reservations at-- Daddy, the tea is getting cold! [LAUGHTER] OK, baby. i guess it's tea party time. Oh, you're lucky. I never get tea party invites. That's because dad is more into sports. Yeah, that's true. Hey, buddy. Tell your dad you love him. I love you, Dad. I love you too, baby. I love you, big guy. Tea time, huh? You want some? I'd love some. How about Daddy? Can Dad have some? Hmm? Oh, thank you. Cheers to us. Cheers. [MUFFLED SOB] [MUSIC PLAYING] BARACK OBAMA: Our nation was founded on a bedrock principle-- that we are all created equal. The project of each generation is to bridge the meaning of those founding words with the realities of changing times, a never-ending quest to ensure those words ring true for every single American. Progress on this journey often comes in small increments-- sometimes two steps forward, one step back, propelled by the persistent effort of dedicated citizens. And then sometimes, there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice. That arrives like a thunderbolt. This morning the Supreme Court recognized that the Constitution guarantees marriage equality. In doing so, they've reaffirmed that all Americans are entitled to the equal protection of the law, that all people should be treated equally, regardless of who they are or who they love. This decision will end the patchwork system we currently have. It will end the uncertainty hundreds of thousands of same-sex couples face from not knowing whether their marriage, legitimate in the eyes of one state, will remain if they decide to move or even visit another. This ruling will strengthen all of our communities, by offering to all loving same-sex couples the dignity of marriage across this great land. I'm sorry. [MUSIC PLAYING]
