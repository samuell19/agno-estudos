Produced by: Ogawa Production At Sanrizuka, protest against construction of Narita Airport has been going on for 7 years. The New Tokyo International Airport Public Corporation has destroyed old villages. eroded their fields and tried to confine the villagers to the ear-shattering environment of the airport. This film is a documentary of the people of Heta and their fight against the Corporation in conjunction with Narita Shibayama Opposition Alliance Group. Interview with one of the hamlet elders, Kizo Ryuzaki There was a major fire here in 1870 or 1871. It started in the centre of the village. At the house of Monem. The flames leapt from house to house. Burning Magobe's place... Juzem's... Niya's and Chozem's too. After the fire they rebuilt. Because it had burnt right down to the end of town. It's well known as the Heta Conflagration. Afterwards the Monem's moved up into the hills. After all, they were the ones who started it. The villagers didn't kick them out. They moved of their own accord. Up to where they're cutting wood. Monem's neighbours paid to rebuild his place. It was the natural thing to do. Was that where Monem's place was? Yes, it was. Was that how they apologised? There was no formal decision made... It just happened. By moving they made amends to the villagers. Same thing happened at a nearby hamlet. The 7 families descend from the Ryuzaki line. Here in Heta you've got the main branch. The Tanakas descended from us. And the other 5 from our 2 main lines. So the 7 Ryuzaki families form one clan. Ryuzakis were samurai in service to the Genji clan. Who lost out to Toyotomi during the Civil Wars. Came to Heta and became farmers. Each family has its own style of house. In our place for example... The living room is to the right of the workroom. The others have theirs on the left. So they live on the left and we on the right. Every other house has theirs on the left side. Why do only the Ryuzakis have it on the right? I don't know. The Ryuzaki temple's the same, isn't it? Yes, again the right side. I suppose you could say... It's to do with water. The village water supply. Being handy to the workroom. Where the cooking takes place. But perhaps it's not so... Anyway, as for the reason... I don't really know, we just do it. Grandad, over next to the Magobe's... Wasn't that a sake factory? Can't make sake without good water, eh? Exactly. The water here is excellent. Very pure water. In the old days... They came from afar for water to make sake. They travelled here to get water for sake? Yes, it does require pure water. It's very clear and pure. - Previously the Miyasaka Sake Factory - Used to go up to the hills to get water. Our water supply is natural, spring water. Everybody uses it. By the "hills" do you mean that forest? Where the sake factory was? Yes, that's right. Over there on the corner - Was that road there in the old days? Which way did it use to go? Over there by the electric pylon. Yes, you can see the bridge. That pathway was the old road. This road wasn't there then? It was a paddyfield. - Old Road - The old road was wider than most. We used to call it "The Path". The Path? Anyone could use it. And the landowner couldn't complain. It used to go up over there. Then they built the school up there. And the students used it to go to school. And the owners couldn't complain? The old Mr. Tonojita... A member of the Retired Folks Action Group. Very active member. Joined every protest demonstration. The thing I remember most about him... He really loved the land, that old fellow. He taught me much. About wild vegetables, flora and fauna. How to cook wild birds. What was in season, nuts, flowers... And how to prepare them. He taught all of us. Why is that place over there deserted? The Niya place. The village pariah...? Yes, and they ended up leaving. Well, the story goes... It started 8 years ago... When the anti-airport group started... As it became more and more active... Niya became an airport supporter. And the villagers stopped socializing with them. - The Niya House is now Deserted - At that time, old man Niya died. Of course there was a funeral. And the villagers planned to attend. Someone sent a message to the committee. Saying the old man had died. The funeral committee? Yes, of course. Asking for help with the funeral, but... But no-one went. But it wasn't an organized boycott. And then, when the Niyas - Brought the body back from the hospital. No-one helped bear the coffin. Because no-one went there. Ended up taking him to the crematorium by car. And cremating him. Here, we usually bury our dead. It's not usual to cremate? They couldn't bury him. No-one to be pall bearers. Or dig the grave. Just the family attended? Yes, and relatives from outside the village. And some nearby aquaintances. Mainly people from outside Heta came. A small, quiet funeral. After that they thought they couldn't live here. So they left the village. Any other cases like that? No, no others. Shuku village divided into pro and anti factions. But still assisted at funerals etc. But here in Heta the anti faction... dominates and so others think we're strong. That's what they say, anyway. Perhaps we wouldn't do it now. Anyway, the anti group is very aggressive. And the funeral happened right at the start. Coincidental, really. About the cremation. As the Niyas bore the coffin... someone started beating on the alarm drum. It really was coincidental. The villagers heard it as a summons. The Niyas thought we were going to attack them. - Emergency Alarm Drum - It disrupted their procession. They thought we were attacking the procession. The villagers used it to warn of danger - - The Niyas Were Said to be Moneylenders - If the police came. The Niyas misunderstood. And were terribly shocked. When in actual fact it was a coincidence. Which they misinterpreted? Yes, they were terrified. But it made our point. We really didn't intend to go that far. - Narita - Heta Village Narrated by Shinsuke Ogawa. On September 16, 1971... A group opposing the compulsory acquisition - of land for the airport construction demonstrated. In the demonstration 3 policemen were killed. It was a coincidence. None of the farmers, students or workers - died in the demonstration. But the possibility of death was high. And what was coincidental about it... Is that the police are attempting a frame-up. To destroy the village of we protestors. And thereby break up our opposition group. So many police came into the village. They poked around and upset the people. Agitated the whole village. This film documents... How the tumult in the village - was handled by the villagers. The human solidarity, the actions - the villagers took to deal with it. Young men from Heta spent the 1972 New Year in prison. January 11th - The arrests started on December 8th, the excuse being the death of three policemen during a demonstration on September 6th. There is no happy new year for the villagers. A further problem has arisen in connection with the Tennami Public Graveyard where one of their leaders, Meiji Ogawa, is buried. His family and the others have signed the graveyard over to the Corporation. This shocked the Alliance who had built a concrete fortress around it for protection. Heta, the birthplace of the clan head Ogawa, is particularly hurt by this action... A rare, heavy winter rain fell. At that difficult time. And in opposition to the Alliance's policy My kin surrendered a graveyard to the airport. The immediate family didn't know anything. There was nothing we could do and it upset us. The family of Meiji Ogawa (deceased) Today, Naokatsu first told us about the graveyard. I'd heard it from the village official So when he told us, I was already aware of it. Said he wanted to relocate his father's grave. And wanted we relatives to help. When I heard what he said, I too said - We can't expect the other villagers to help. That's all I could say. If I were in his position - I would have done the same thing. The Heta villagers helped the four Kinone families that remained after the others had left the village. They shared the work and the fighting but weren't informed of the Kimone decision to part with the graveyard. Heta understood that they needed assistance for relocating the remains... But still the four young men of Heta remain in jail... Meiji's son, Naokatsu - really wanted the villagers to help him - relocate his father's grave. But they don't have the right to ask us. He came and talked to Magobe and I. We suggested that whatever the conclusion - He should take it up with the village officials. - Yuichi Hagiwara - He came to my place straight away. Naokatsu told us what they'd said. And he asked me what he should do. I said don't ask the villagers to help. He did as I suggested. The villagers kept to the Alliance's policy And refused to give up the graveyard. I nold Naokatsu that I couldn't help him. That's what I said to him. The Leader Ogawa and Naokatsu - always helped each other out but because - Naokatsu never mentioned the graveyard surrender - It's his responsibility and Hanzem is upset. Naokatsu's fields and his house... are his own, unlike the grave. He'd never sell them. He's joined the Alliance and is working hard. Over and above that... - Hikoshige Uriu - Regarding Meiji's body. The problem of relocating it. As villagers and Alliance members - how should we handle it? If any of you have any ideas. We'd like to hear them. As I see it, the stand of the Alliance, - And the stand of the villagers - Differ slightly. The 3 remaining families in Kinone Hamlet - Including Naokatsu, joined us last year. The Corporation has undermined the Kinone folk. Most have left and the hamlet is broken up. So we've encouraged them to join us. Bearing that in mind - how can we help the remaining three families? And what line should we take in the future? I want to think about this as a villager. When we had his father's funeral. We named it the Anti-Airport Alliance Funeral. We men dug the grave and our women catered. I won't say we did everything. But we did the important things. The Grave of Meiji Ogawa In the Tennami Public Graveyard The Tennami Graveyard, Resting Place of M. Ogawa Through the actions of the Corporation It now belongs to the Corporation. The issue of what Naokatsu will do from now on. Depends on whether we support him or not. We must stick by him. I think Naokatsu and the others want that, too. And as for helping relocate the grave, The family feel they can't really ask the villagers. So they say... There's a concrete wall around the grave. It's 30 cm thick and 180 cm high. - The Fortress Around Meiji-san's Grave - It's no small job to demolish it. Especially with our simple farmer's tools. It's no easy job for a couple of men. The Corporatioon is bound to come. That's not to say that our fight ends here. Even though we've lost on the graveyard issue. We must stand by them and what is theirs. If not, the Corporation will do their worst. And we're not going to let them! We, the people of Heta, must act - before the Corporation does. Therefore, we must join together. And, in this regard - we must be close and united. Using the death of the 3 cops as an excuse - They're bound to come and arrest more of our young. And the Corporation has a plan. A plan to break the bond between Kinoe and Heta. Which would bring Kinone onto their side. - The clan of Meiji Ogawa Take Ogawa - And effectively break-up the Alliance. Our young men in prison. Are victims of the Corporation's policy. I'm not good with words. But that's what I think. Tomorrow's newspapers may say that - "Kinone Sold Out" The villagers asked the opinion of those close to the imprisoned men. Many of our followers are now under lock and key. Young Farmers Action Group (YFAG) member Shinji Ishii. One thing that we must do is - adopt the tactics of the Corporation. And never, ever give in! For that reason, the Alliance - in each and every village must resolve its doubts and join together. - YFAG members - It's very easy for all of us - to call Naokatsu and the others to task - for what they've gone and done. But if we say that - if we dwell, on the sale of the graveyard. We'll lose the three families - the only ones left in Kinone. That's what I think. And we have a responsibility - to tell this to those in jail. Even though we weren't aware of it at first. Because we are involved in this - we must cope with the consequences. Whatever happens as a result. We must tell them frankly. Because if we don't, they'll feel betrayed. Those 3 young men from Heta in jail - will feel it, I think. Recently, the 3 lost their leader - Before he died - He tried to save the graveyard. By taking the leadership. But, as you know - he couldn't continue the fight. Because he martyred himself. He had a strong wish. The wish that we would save the graveyard. But now we've lost the graveyard. And the Corporation has won it. Now, the best thing that we can do is - not dwell upon this defeat. What can I say? It's one step backwards. But we must do something. To get out of this vicious circle. That's what I think. We must try again. To make Naokatsu and the others in Kinone - realize just how we feel about it. Therefore, we must help the family members - with the task of relocating the body. "After death, the spirit..." "still fights against evil." Is carved on his gravestone! The last request of Meiji Ogawa, our vice-chairman. I believe his spirit remains with his family. And with us of the Anti-Airport Alliance. Therefore, those that he left behind - must respect the wishes of his spirit. Until the very end. With his spirit we'll oppose the airport. The villagers themselves decide to help relocate. - The Villagers - - The Tennami Public Graveyard - They brought the remains back to Heta Temple. - Heta Hamlet - The word "Heta" implies edge or corner. 1.000 years ago it was called "Hishitamura" Located at the very edge of the old Kazusa area, Heta was one entrance to Hishitamura. So the villagers also called it Heta Entrance. To all the people of the Hishita area - please gather - this is an emergency! This is the Hishita Farmers Broadcast Center! At this moment - at the home of Sannomiya in Heta Hamlet - The riot police are invading his house. Please gather in front of Sannomiya's house. The police - just recently - finally released him on bail. And then when - he tried to meet with his family. Young Mr. Aikawa from Sakashioka - Just after he was released on bail. They re-arrested him. The parents... His fellows at the YFAG Had no time to even greet him. In connection with the July 26th incident. They re-arrested him. Today, again the police - Have unjustifiably arrested 3 others. And they have a warrant for one more. And now, yet again - with some intention - they've come to the house of Sannomiya in Heta. They've invaded his house. To the people of Hishita - your attention please. We ask each and every one of you. To gather immediately. At the house of Sannomiya in Heta Hamlet. Please gather. Go to the grave! To the grave of the dead boy! Last year on October 1st, the son of Sannomiya - suicided, leaving a note which started - "I hate those who brought this airport on us..." Go to the grave and pray! You cruel bastards. - Old Man Miyasaka - The first time in our country's history. You come investigate at the house of the dead. Go pay your respects at his grave. You kill him and dare come here to his house... Think of how he must feel. How dare you come here brazenly? You know Fumio's in his grave, don't you? You have the face of men but not the spirit. We'll sound the alarm and kick you out. You're not coming to get us, we're gonna get you. You're no better than gangsters. Police came to the house of the dead Fumio because he was a member of the YFAG - they took away an empty oil drum... We farmers buy our oil in drums! You drum thieves! Plainclothes cops! Plainclothes thieves! Next time we'll have to pay for a new drum, too. Why are you taking that drum? Everybody with a car has one. Are they forbidden to us? Shit! Up to this point over 40 youths had been arrested. The women gather to honor the gods. She offered two-pronged radish to the god. It's my turn and I want to make it funnier. - At the Public Hall - Mrs. Tsubaki makes phallic doll - important offering. The funnier the better. The last time our fraternity - only had small radishes. And so, to make it interesting - we decided to make the phallus. It represents the important part of the god Koyasu-sama. Simply put, "father of children". Because it's the father of children. And it's very important. The phallus - god of safe births & upbringing. And mark of respect to the god Koyasu-sama. This radish represents the male organ? That's right. We do it as a mark of respect to the gods of - safe births and upbringing. Where I was born we consider it - to be very important. And over and above other offerings - this is the most important thing - and we treat it like a god. Here they used to only offer 2-pronged radishes But since last year - When you came here to film. You thought it was interesting. And we had a lot of laughs making it. It is very funny. Yes, making the phallus of a man. In the village where I was born - We don't peel the radishes and they're much longer. So they look like this. Do they use the dragon's beard there, too? Yes. You call this, "Dragon's beard", don't you? As the pubic hair. Without it, it's not very realistic. And these sweet potatoes. Crudely put, they're the balls. Compared to the radish, they're small, eh? Maybe I should cut it smaller. With the hair you can't see the balls. You can't see them. I don't know what the next person will do. I said "Take a good look!" The Heibe clan's matriach - Taka Tsubaki. In the village the clan is called "Heibe". their surname, perhaps their first ancestor's. She is one of the staunchest fighters. She's often appeared in our production - of the fight scenes in The Narita Series. Thanks for suggesting the sweet potatoes. It's a good addition. They're very realistic. Yes, without the balls - it won't serve the purpose. Compare it to your own. Which is better? The harder, the better. This old lady - came as a bride from Kuju Kuri. Kuju Kuri is a fishing village. And it's apparent in - her way of thinking, festivals, relationships. Her way of doing things - show very well that she is from Kuju Kuri. The radish that she's prepared. The phallus that she's made from it - shows the influence of a fishing village. I was the one who thought this up. They didn't use to make it like this. How was it before? They'd take a two-pronged radish - and offer it with the leaves still on. But we completely revamped it. We're first among those who take it in turns. So we thought we'd make it like this. But we don't know what the next lot will make. Tonojita's group is the next in line. Remember this when you leave us. Give you something to laugh about. How Heibei made a work of art. That's one finished. Next, pour rice over it. Even with their boys in jail, the rites continue. Which is the front? Shall I put it up higher? - They Pass it on to Next Years' Group - Tsubaki & Aoyagi this year Uriu & Ryuzaki next. The handing-over ceremony. Four women carry the small box. And solemnly make a circle. Inside the box is a book. Recording the names of those born in the hamlet. If the child's name is recorded in the book - it means the child is accepted. That's their custom. So, brides coming from other villages - worried about their children being recorded. If it wasn't written in the book. It meant they weren't accepted. It was very important in the old days. You haven't cleaned up after yourselves. Thanks for your help. I've got a present for you. Thank you. Those Next in Line Accept Responsibility for it. The hamlet has many fertility rites like this - dating fom ages past. Ones for men, women, old people, children, etc. They've almost disappeared. But recently, here in Heta - they've been revived. In order to fight the outside world - the villagers have drawn closer. Realized the value of the folk-rites - and treated them with due respect. Not just the old things are valued. Many new groupings, clubs in the village. Women's Action Group. Young Farmers Action Group. Retired Folks Action Group. These groups are the basis for tomorrow's - historical rites, I think. - From Winter Thru Summer - Hanzem's great-grandmother is now 86 years old. And she always had a word for us. I came here as a bride when I was 20 years old. The following year we cleared new fields. My husband and I spent a total of 7 years - clearing the new fields. Worked hard for 7 years. Then came back here. Because he got sick... In the head. He soon got well. But once he attacked me. He almost killed me. Fortunately, the knife didn't - hit a vital point. His father was the head wood-cutter - that's why there was a big machete in the house That machete... My husband... At the new land... He became ill. And our relatives came to get us. At the time, my husband... Wanted to stay there with the children. "I want to stay here." He said. But one of the relatives talked him into - coming back here to his father's house. And so we came back here. At 20 years old, she went by horse to the virgin land carrying 2 sacks of possessions. They laboured to clear new fields and earnt pence making charcoal. As was the custom, they assumed his father's debts. After 7 years of toil her husband left to pay the debt but she saw him hide the money under a tree, and flee. He didn't return. Time passed and she heard he was back in Heta. Gathering her 3 children she went back to the village. It was in November of that year... By the lunar calendar... The night of November 23rd it was. Very early in the morning. He got up and sat by the hearth. Told me to cook breakfast. Even though I knew he was ill, I said yes. And so I got up. And, very soon after. He went out to the kiln. He waited for me with the machete. So I went up to the kiln. Thinking that if I did something constructive - it might calm him down. As I was thinking... I went to grab a piece of wood. Perhaps I moved first... Or maybe he struck my head first... I fell down. The lady from the next house. She's the mother of the old man next door. We'd often worked together in the fields. As I lay, my husband hacked my legs twice. He cut them twice. And the pain was so bad I couldn't stand. So I crawled over to her house. I screamed at her to wake up. "Catch him!" I shouted. And I could see him running away - across the paddy field. On the other side of the field. There's a pathway that rises slightly there. On the left side in the bushes there's a well. And he fell into the well. Not deep enough to drown in. It belonged to the neighbouring hamlet. Very, very shallow. That night, the Hyoem family from across the way - They were observing the equinox festival. And all the men were there. They'd been gambling all night. When they heard all the commotion. They came running to the well. And pulled him out. They made a fire to warm him up. And lent him a dry kimono. Then they all helped to carry him - to the temple, where he was locked up. He was in there for 10 days. I stayed there and the doctor came - every day for a week. If he'd hit my cranium, I'd have died instantly. I've still got the scar. The blood poured out. My eldest boy was 5 then. When he saw me crawling, covered in blood - he cried, because he was so young. So, I had him stay at the house on the corner. Now the Koyabas live there - At that time it was our relatives, the Kados. They really looked after my little boy, Waichi. - After that he Recovered and they had 8 Children - I had a hard time. I've been here for ages. Came when I was 19 and now I'm 86. I've had a long life. When you get to this age you can die anytime. When I die... If I don't have a funeral photograph - It'll be hard for my kin - to get a photographer to take the picture. If you can take one of me mow. You'll save me a lot of worry. When I was 18. There was a man who wanted to see my photo. And I was going to... Can you make a print from the film? Yes, we can. We'll make one for you. I'm so happy. The matriarch of the Hanzem line is 86 years old. We went to her house to do some filming. But she didn't quite understand - the difference between a movie and still camera. So she thought we'd come here to take the - formal portrait displayed at funerals. She saw it as her final act - so she wanted to look her best. - The Matriarch at 18 - She had them brush her hair. And then arrange it. We thought it was alright as it was. - The Matriarch Talks About Gambling - Furthermore, she got out a very thick - deep purple, formal cushion. And arranged her own bonsai tree next to ner. There she was, a tiny lady, sitting royally - on her cushion next to the bonsai. "What shall we talk about?", she asked. I'll never forget the image she created. When she first came here at 20, gambling was rife. In the old days in Heta - If three or more men gathered, they'd gamble. I really hate gambling. That's why we had to clear the new fields. Did gambling really affect you? Yes, very much. I hate gambling. It's a way to get money without working. Rolling those dice - Odds or evens - And the winner grabs all the money. He'd put a little aside each time he won. And we'd have to buy food with that. Why did they gamble? The men loved to gamble. Why did they like it? All of the men in Heta loved gambling. After I came here my father-in-law - was arrested twice for gambling. While he was in jail - they had him husking rice and wheat. Then he took the husker and - BANG! That's exactly what he did. And they got so angry with him. So then they switched him over - to making fishing nets. He got quite good at netmaking. That's a true story. I had it hard in the old days. Did your generation have the chance to go to school? They built the school when I was 13. There were four in my family. I was the eldest. The first born. So I looked after the others. When I was 13, there were girls going to school. But I didn't go. If I'd taken the baby with me - I'd be able to write my name... That's why I hate elections. You have to write your name, I hate that. Now I can't even walk there. When I was 13 - girls were going to school. A long, long time ago. - Gambling Disappeared When the Movement Started - So you've seen many changes here over the years? Yes, many changes. Changed completely. The gambling has slowly disappeared. No-one here left to play. It's four kilometers from - the station at East village to Heta. So my parents advised against me coming here. "Such a remote far-away place", they said. So why did you come? He was so persistent. And finally talked them into it. You fell in love with him, too? I guess I did. A long, long time ago. - Suddenly She Chanted a Sutra For Us - These words of the Buddah save all life. I've prayed for you. Thank you very much, grandmother. Please have a long, long life. Thank you very much. You said you wanted to talk. That's why I spoke of the old days. Whenever we have prayers, even at a funeral. I'll say a prayer for you. I'll get the priest to join me. There's no-one else, only me. - The Next Day - - Early morning, July 5th, 1972 - - Haruo Ryuzaki was Arrested Again - My son, Haruo - they've just come and arrested him. I wonder if they've also taken - young Masahiko of the Tsukinuki clan? No, not yet. I don't know if they're both involved. The warrant was for... ...assault resulting in death? Something about "assault..." Can't remember if it was that or not. Hey! You bastards! You've no cause! You're all fools! - Haruo's Father - Masahiko's not in the vehicle. - The Police Came to Masahiko's That Afternoon - This time they had a lot of charges. Obstruction of justice. Assault and assault resulting in death. Resulting in death...? Death? You're kidding? Why charge him with that? I want to see the arrest warrant. He's here, there's no hurry. Read it carefully. You've plenty of time. Let him read it. Head every word of it. "The Hotta Army and..." Get back, get back. Get those cars back. Just pull those cars back. You can't just come barging in. You bastards! Why the hell do you come barging in here? This is a private road! Who's in charge? Which one of you idiots is in charge? Don't upset them. "Assault resulting in death", it says. "...resulting in death"?! What did Haruo's say? Haruo Ryuzaki's? His was the same. That's not true! Read the next page carefully, too. Are you in charge? I want to know who's in charge here. What's his name? Who's in charge? How do you read that character? What's after "Yoshikawa"? Han. Han Yoshikawa. Get Masahiko's jail bag. Where are you taking him? We are taking him to Matsudo lockup. Matsudo? Do you want to check it? Not if it's only his necessities. His clothes... Are there mosquitoes in the lockup? Yes. He'll need money. There's a little in the bag. Send him straight back! There's a long-sleeved shirt in there. You can sleep in it. Don't kick him out in the middle of the night again. Bring him back without fail! Without fail! You're all fat pigs. Give it your best, Masahiko! You should use your bloody heads! If you did, you wouldn't be doing this. Taking such a serious young fellow. Drive him back here! You big ugly bugger! They're our tools, not weapons. Keep your head up, Masahiko! Don't let them get you down. Don't worry about us. We'll manage. Let go, he can walk. No violence, please. Keep your chin up. Don't worry about us. We'll do the worrying. Good luck! I'll go along. You treat him carefully. And bring him back by car. You understand? - Masahiko, Don't Worry About the Watermelons - The riot police came here this morning. They were watching your place. So many mosquitoes, I couldn't sleep last night. So earlier this morning. I heard them shouting. They woke you up? But you've a good son, there. He's got a good attitude. My grandson, Haruo read the warrant. He threw it back in their faces. Again they're arresting our boys. State Power - Riot Police We farmers opposed to the airport construction are angry at your tactics. We will do whatever we can. Young men of Heta. Join together and raise your voices - at the injustice done to Masahiko. This is the Hishita Farmers Broadcast Tower. This Day They Arrested the Following Young Men ****HIROKO RETYPE THIS ONE USING hamlet Asakura Hamlet: Kenichi Akiba Sakashioka Hamlet: Akira Saitoh Shuku Hamlet: Hideo Yanagawa Toho Hamlet: Shoji Shimamura Nakago Hamlet: Akira Kiakawa, Shigeo Tomura, Katsuo Maeda Higashi Hamlet: Susumu Ogawa, Hiroshi Ogawa Heta Hamlet: Masahiko Uryu, Haruo Ryuzaki Yokobori Hamlet: Yukio Ono Activity Starts in the Village. July 26th. They were indicated for assault and assault resulting in death. August 1st. - The Situation is Worse Than They Expected - No matter how good the conditions - people soon tire of the same institution. That's what the Central Committee has asked us to do. - Village Rescue Squad Member, Yuichi Hagiwara - Hospitalized or imprisoned by the police They've held them these past 30 days. Dragged away from their homes - seeing no-one but their interrogators every day. They're normal boys so they must really - be suffering, I think. If it was Koyaba instead of his boy - I doubt he'd last three days. They're suffering and bearing up well. Even when they're in jail - surely they're worried about us here. About their own work. How we're managing without them. That's all they're thinking of. Feeling isolated and alone. The poor boys - Listening to lies and false statements. Being told that the others have confessed, etc. Each and every day. To the point where they can't believe anyone. They're bound to start doubting... And they're burdened with that load. To relieve them of the burden - we must take up their work load so they've a home to come back to. Because if we don't - then "Rescue Squad" is just meaningless words. We should have discussed this matter - When they first came here to arrest them. That was last December. At that time the YFAG took up the burden. So we didn't have to worry about it. But now most of them have been arrested. In the beginning those who were released - carried the load for the next to be arrested. Not just visits but meals and everything But this time - They've got most of them and none have returned. So now the Parents Alliance - must take up where they've left off. And we parents - must provide support in every village. The main Alliance is busy building the tower. In front of the runway. So it's left to us to support our boys. That's what the Central Committee have asked us to do. Juzem from the Committee, I and two village officials - went to visit them today. We must make more efforts at this kind of support - now and in the future. We've got to consider their feelings. Our concern for them must not - become a burden to them. We're all busy with our work and our fight. But we must - We must join together and work together. The most important thing to encourage the boys in jail and help their families with their chores. - Fater of Jailed Haruo, Katsue Ryuzaki - I'd like to say something. Since my son was arrested - some of you - have helped with visits and food for him - and helped us on the farm. We appreciate it. And as a result we're still here. In my opinion - we are obviously oppressed in the fighting And we've been fighting for 6 - 7 years. As it now stands my son is in jail - and has been for a month. You've all been very supportive to us - and you've taken up the burden of our worries. I can't speak for my son. But I feel badly about what we've brought on you. I think you've all been too kind towards us. And so, from now on - in the matter of visits and flood for him - I think it's sufficient - to visit every 10 days or 2 weeks. We've brought our troubles onto all of you - and what I'm saying now, my words alone - will seem perhaps a little cold. But please don't judge me harshly. Thank you very much. I disagree with that. Before, when some of our boys were released - their parents told them - how everyone had pitched into help. I think that's wrong. Because they, our young men - went to jail in place of the rest of us villagers. So, they shouldn't feel they owe us - for the visits and helping out on the farms The arrested Masahiko's mother - Sumiko Uriu. Sorry that our need has kept you from your work. Not at all. We are keeping up with it. So the families of the imprisoned boys - should not feel that they owe anything - in the way of debt to us. Your suggestion would distance us from you. That's not our intention. I feel the same way as Mr. Ryuzaki. It's not necessary to visit them every day. He can survive without it. That may be so but they are fed - and they won't starve. You don't have to... We're not overdoing it. We'll continue as we have been. - If the villagers feel constrained the human relationship will suffer We're well aware of the pressures on us all. And since they started arresting - The Young Farmers Action Group The newspapers have carried stories saying - that our opponents feel we're starting to crack - because of financial hardships. The authorities have made detailed studies - of how this whole thing is affecting us - financially and emotionally. So therefore, in the worst case - they arrest all our boys - then we won't be able to do anything. Not even to pay their bail. That's what they want to happen as soon as possible. So if we stick close together - they can't do anything to us. Because the worst they can do is to take our boys. And we shouldn't help them to do it. We've got to stick close together. They have, and will continue to make - multiple arrests for the same supposed crime. They're recording who goes to visit and when. As well as what's in the parcels we take. That's for sure. It's one source of collecting data about us. They'll use it to decide such things as - how many to arrest next time. That's how dirty they act. Our ties are the most important thing for us. They know that and they try to split us. They did it by taking our boys. And we can show that we're not splitting - by increasing, not cutting our support for them. Recently when the mothers visited them - they gave a little money to each of them. And the boys complained about the amount. They replied, "It's not the amount -" "it's the spirit in which it's given." And when the authorities hear things like this - they take them into account. So, we must remember - that all we say and do stacks up - and encourages our boys in prison. So even if we're busy on the farms - we must still support them. And show our defiance to the authorities. On the other hand, during harvest - we suffer if they're not here to help. And if the authorities know that - they'll think they've scored another victory - towards breaking up the village. Put yourself in place of the cops. Even we could come up with that tactic. And if they do destroy us - it means that the 6 years we've dedicated - will have been meaningless. The airport is still not built... Because we've fought it all the way. The press say they can't start flying for 6 months. The cops, especially the top brass - are planning ways to break us apart... And no doubt going into great detail. After the 3 cops died our Alliance - has steadily lost mementum. A speech by a Construction Ministry official stated - the building of a new dam claimed only a few lives. And now the police are using the 3 deaths - as justification to finish the airport construction. - Eisuke Ishii - The police haven't yet murdered any of us - according to the letter of the law. But they have indirectly caused some deaths. Here in Heta there have been victims. And the cops have covered up these deaths. the cops will do everything to use the 3 deaths - as an excuse to smash our Alliance. Every single activity that we've carried out - has been done properly. But by indicting our boys for murder - the cops have skillfully manipulated the mass media - into describing us as criminals. It's obvious how they're using our boys. We've must taken this into account in our strategy. It's not really our boys that they're after. - Seiji Akiba - They want to smash us and destroy the village. That's why they arrest them. They're taking our boys as a form of blackmail. If they know that we understand their tactics. It's going to really upset them. So we must understand this. The innocence of our boys will turn to guilt - if they do manage to smash our Alliance. If we let them set the pace then, truly - our sons will be judged guilty of murder. If we do our best they will be found innocent. Village Official - Nobuyoshi Ogawa. They're not just oppressing our boys - they're also oppressing us. The important thing is for us to realize - that each of us is being oppressed. We must each make sure we realize this. It's easy enough to understand the words - But we must also understand the meaning. And do something to counter it. That's what we must do. If we don't, then our efforts at assistance - will be a burden on them. In order to prevent the destruction of the village - they must help those who've lost their bread-winners. When the situation stretches out, the family hesitates to ask for help. If I have to go and ask them what they need - then they're reluctant to ask for our help. So I'd like the neighbours to judge - their needs and report them to me. It's the best way to do it. For all concerned. And we won't be wasting time. One more thing... Let's not get too formal. By asking "what do you need?" Sometimes I don't have time to go and check. And we shouldn't call out in passing. What do you think? I agree. The best way for all concerned. If we do it well. Without making it too formal. So no more calling for help from outside. For the time being. Keeping it within the village is the best way. And when our fight ends, we should keep it up. - One Week Later - In the heat of summer a detective came to the house of the suicide Fumio. Why now? - Fumio's Father, Takeji Sannomiya - One was a Section Chief, detective Watanabe. The other was in uniform. He's from nearby. The detective, I've never met before. How can I say it...? You should have heard him. He was really ill at ease. And tried to be friendly. What did he want to say? What could I say? We kind of stood shoulder to shoulder. He expressed sympathy over the death of Fumio. "The thing is..." he said. "We didn't think he was so involved" He seemed very sympathetic about it. "The other boys being questioned said -" "Fumio was their leader when it happened." That's what he said to me. I heard him out in silence. "But it's sad about Fumio." Then he went on to say - "I'm here to find out what he did -" "on the day of the incident." "Perhaps you can help me there." Of course I told him that I didn't know - anything about his activities. And I know nothing about what happened that day. And that's the truth. "Is that so?" He said. And didn't press me at all. He seemed sympathetic. Kept trying hard to be understanding. He kept his cool. So I didn't let down my guard either. I just listened to what he said. And then I said to him - "I don't like talking to you about this -" "But I think my son was a great man." "A very great man." "And I still think so." "no matter what anyone says about him." - "I'll never change my opinion." "And from how on -" "I'll never entertain the possibility -" "that my son was a fool." "And so, I've nothing to say about him to you" That's what I told him. He said, "Is that so?" Then asked me one more question. - The police Suspect He Remove Pages From His Son's Will: Hence the Investigation. "You found his will" He said. - Mother of the dead Fumio, Shizue Sannomiya - "Did someone take a few pages from his will?" - Would a Bereaved Father Remove Pages From the Will of His Son? - They suspect that I did it. As if I could do such a thing. Suspecting people is their business. If you hadn't seen me - When I found Fumio - You couldn't understand how upset I was. I would never do... The house of Sannomiya - is trusted and respected by all - the villagers in Heta. Because they're good, hardworking folk. Whenever something happens in the village - Sannomiya is one of the first to be consulted. Their first-born son, Fumio - committed suicide as a protest - against the airport construction last Fall. The villagers have treated them carefully. When the detective came out of the blue - asking questions. It upset the villagers very much. So much that they held a meeting. Shown in the previous scene. At that time, the detective visited - other villages in the Alliance. Asking questions at the homes of the arrested boys. They went from house to house. And the story was different at each place. Upsetting the families of the boys. It seemed as if he was trying to - make each family suspicious of the others. Trying to find the villagers weak points - and upset the harmonious balance. Then smash the Alliance. It was so obvious what they tried to do. As far as the indicted boys are concerned - They don't think they're innocent till proven guilty. They must find them guilty. They don't have a shred of evidence. So they're looking for witnesses. From their point of view - the boys in jail know something - and they think they can make them talk - by sowing doubt in the homes in the Alliance. That's what their tactic is. We don't know where they'll come next. But they will come to the village. on any little pretext. So we must understand the reason - behind their excuses for coming. They'll act cool, they're professionals - and they'll pick up any information. Without fail. If they come, sound the alarm and kick them out. That's all we can do. It's only going to get harder for us - from now on. You're right. It's not the kind of action we can see. It's not like dealing with riot police or being hit. At least we could see them. Now we don't even get that. We won't be able to anticipate things. If we can see our opponents - we can call the others to battle. But if we can't see them. It's hard to fight back. Remember that no-one showed us what to do - When we first started our struggle. Let's think like we did back then. That's the key to solving this problem. None of us should doubt the others. That'll breed distrust between us. For example, in my work as an official - I have to go out every day. And I've come to worry about my own fields. But if we really think about it - our protest has become our work. And our boys have been in jail over a month. So helping out every 3-4 days is our duty. I firmly believe this. If we do, we'll never doubt each other - and our village will be a model of solidarity. I think that's what we should strive for. We all have our own problems - even without the drama of our protest. Those problems pile up. And affect our relationship with each other. Let's go back to the beginning - as our tactic to fight this new problem. So if someone says - "Today I don't feel up to it..." "OK, I'll take your place." No matter how minor the help is. It's important to build up that trust. The 20 indicted boys were not released for the O-Bon Festival - In the fields - As for me - just the other day - when I went to see my boy. There was a woman sitting next to me. Asked where I was from. I told her, Heta. She said she was - from Saku village. And both her husband and son had been arrested. She was half-sobbing as she told me. At first the cops came to get her husband. He was trying to protect his forest. And they caught him up a tree. No-one else from Saku was arrested - Said she felt like a fool losing both. Then she said - "I've caused trouble for the villagers." "I've no place to hide." "That's wrong!" I told her. "But..." she said. "Only our house..." She was sobbing the whole time. How sad... Each village is different, eh? - Each Village is Different But They Share The Fate Of Their Boys Being Arrested - Tears were running down her face... I told her not to be too upset. But she said - "Why don't they let our boys go?" She was very worried. The people in Saku - cry when they visit the jail. The boys cry too, I hear. When we leave the jail - we always ask if they need anything. They never do. We Heta mothers are very strong. So we never cry. We never cry when visiting. And neither do our boys. Each village's different and the people, too. That's what I thought. In villages where the ties are loose - the mothers soon cry. Here in Heta, we're all part of the Alliance - But in the villages where they're fewer - the women tend to cry. That's right. Because the village bonds are strong - that makes us strong. Because of everybody else. In places where the bonds are weak - they have no energy. There's a big difference in the spirit of - those parents from committed villages - and those who are not. It's harder on them. When everyone's not committed - the villages with loose bonds - with less opposition - they tend to tears. If I lived in that village - If I were a mother from there - I'd probably cry, too. - Mother of the Arrested Haruo - Tomo Ryuzaki. - My relation's boy from up in Iwayama - last March during watermelon planting - he was first arrested. The next time was during the tomato harvesting. His mother just gave up and spent her time crying. Her uncle was pro-airport and she asked him - to go visit her boy in jail. My husband told her not to. But she was so busy. She ended up asking him to help in the fields. And we looked after her boy in jail. But her relatives helped in the fields. Even the pro-airport ones. In Iwayama village - The family helps in the fields. Relatives of those in jail helped with harvest and all the crops are in by now. I hope that no-one - complained about helping out. But someone would've said something. Up in Iwayama - those whose boys are in jail - round up the villagers - get their cars out and ask them to - go visit their boys. Right, let's start. This is a harvesting scene. It's now the harvest season. They sell the rice from this field - And use the money for Alliance activities. For example, bail money. And the many other uses that arise in their fight. The men have a field, too. This field is village property. It's interesting to note that when those - who were pro-airport left the village - they abandoned their fields. And then, those fields - sprouted weeds and bushes. When the farmers see these fields - It makes them feel as if their flesh is rotting. So they went in, cleaned and planted... The fields of those who left are used by all. The police and the Corporation - look upon it as trespass. And bring in their laws. They call it larcency and trespass. Arresting the farmers for their crimes. But in reality - the sight of these wasted fields - full of weeds and abandoned - repelled the farmers like their own flesh rotting. - October 3rd: Night - - The Young Men were Released on High Bail -??? They're back! Welcome back! Welcome home and thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. At the front of the Public Hall. Thank you very much for all your assistance. You've been in for so long, haven't you? Yes, we finally came home. Good to see you. Don't you think I've gotten fat? I didn't use any energy. I got fat. How is your health? I'm fine, thank you. Thank you, for everything. I really appreciate it. Yes, all of them are released. Everyone's fine. We had a lot of time to talk. Thirty cells in a row... And the ones on the end were lookouts. - That night all of the young men were released and returned to their villages - Good work. Haruo and Masahiko have spent 90 days in jail. Tonight they're back home. They have fought a battle that we - couldn't imagine. And tonight - they're back home where they belong. During their absence their families too - suffered much and bore a heavy burden. For these 90 days, thanks to all the villagers - the students and Ogawa Production. Your visits, your gifts of food, your labour - attending the trials. The many things you've done to help. We offer our heartfelt thanks. Your assistance and support - helped to bring home our boys, today. The trials have yet to come. And there are many things unfinished. But we will continue with the ties we've forged. Let's continue! Thank you all for coming tonight. What an excellent speech! Truly great. Since my son, Masahiko - was arrested last July 5th - 90 days have passed. Tonight - he has returned. - Masahiko's Father Hikoshige Uryu - And it's all because of you people. Recently, when we were so busy with harvesting your kind assistance - to my son and my family. Visits, gifts and your help in the fields. I can't find words to express my gratitude. Thank you so much. We must make a fresh resolve to hamper - the airport construction to the very end. That's what we must resolve to do. I would like to say a word of thanks. - Haruo's Father, Katsue Ryuzaki - Today marks the 90th day since Haruo's arrest. In this time, your gifts - your visits, your help with our fields - your kind thoughts and deeds. The encouragement you've given us all. I have no words to thank you. Today, Masahiko and Haruo - are back in our midst. Even though they've been arrested - their spirits have not been imprisoned. And they'll continue the fight. I firmly believe. The fight we now face - Is different from the past. It's no longer a contest of strength. It's become political and more difficult. We must strengthen our ties and work hard - to stop the airport. My son, myself - all together. Thank you all for everything. That's all I have to say. During the 90 days I spent in jail - - Masahiko Uryu - sometimes I was lonely - but your visits, your gifts. and your support gave me strength. Thank you very much. Haruo, you must say thank you. Thanks to everyone. Thank you everybody. - Haruo Ryuzaki - Today we returned to our village. I can hardly believe - that I'm back home again. I'll probably take a couple of days. I will never give up the fight. They've pushed me right to the edge. There's nowhere else to go. It's a new start. I feel there's a new beginning for us. Now, more than ever, we'll be oppressed. And our fight will get harder and harder. I will fight to the end. For the Narita Shibayama Opposition Alliance Group. I want to be found innocent. But I don't care if I'm not. More important to stop the airport - by any means at all. That's what I want above all. We often hear the phrase "Giving in". But we will never, ever give in. Why? Because this is our home. Even if we receive long sentences - we'll come back here, to our homes. There's no other place to go. Whatever we do, there's no place to run to. Our minds are made up. All of us. We know what we've done. And we know what we haven't done. We'll stick with the truth. We have no way - or reason to apologize to those 3 who died. - While Imprisoned - Many, many times - I wished I were a student. "I'm giving up the fight." They said. "Going back to Tokyo." "It's not my fight." I couldn't say that. I can never break my bond with you. My home is here, in this village. As you well know. We're not politically sophisticated. That's their strong point - and our weakness. Yesterday I went guarantor for bail - and went to the courthouse. They said "Your son may destroy -" "vital evidence." And I said - He's the firstborn of a farmer - raised to be the head of the family one day. And he works hard. He'd never destroy evidence or obstruct justice. And he'll never run away. That's what I told the judge. His name is Judge Kondo. The morning I was arrested - I first thought to escape. I ran out when I heard the alarm. And saw the police nearby. At the house of my friend. Perhaps they won't come, I thought. But as I did, they came down the hill - heading towards my place. I thought of running to the mountains. But just for an instant. Your grandfather told us that - "You've got plenty of time to get away" He said. You replied... "Anyway, they'll catch me sometime." Then they came and took you away. He told that tale many times. You were busy with the harvest. You were the best worker of all. In retrospect, escaping wasn't such a good idea. But it seemed so at the time. Yes, yes. It's not something that ends with escaping. You put your youth into the watermelons. Those melons were due out the next day. It wasn't such a good idea. I didn't expect it. If I had I wouldn't have been so shocked. Assault resulting in death, wasn't it? They got you that morning? I wasn't at home then, they got me later on. I'd been sleeping in the Ogawa Pro building. It was like a dream. When I saw the warrant. "Assault resulting in death", it said. I thought it was some mistake. I thouqht I'd be out in 2-3 days. But when I got there...! If you're tired go to bed. We slept ten hours a day in jail. We'll follow your lead. You've suffered so much in there. Your dad can go tell your grandfather. "Your grandson's free." It'll all come out in the trial. Were your cells nearby? We were 10 cells apart. A gangster was next door. He handled it better than me. He'd been in for a year, murder charge. Not at all afraid. When the cops came he told them off. He kept trying to cheer me up. I saw his friends when they came to visit. In two big Lincoln Continentals. Another one of them came in a Ford Thunderbird. Most were about 23-24, the oldest around 28. The one next to me was from Kisaratsu. The fishermen there received a big settlement. About 20 or 30 million yen. The gangsters took 7 or 8 million off them - in one night of gambling. He often had 50 or 60 million in cash. Never, ever told on their boss. And they were in jail - taking the place of their boss. It helps them advance. Get out after 6-7 years. And live the good life. But it's better not to go in at all. For the average person. It was hard for me - But you visited and encouraged me. And you all waited for me. So it was worth it. But the boys from Iwayama - they looked fine... But were really suffering. This village of ours, Heta - all pulled together. So I could trust in you all. We've fought since I was a boy. But the village always remained firm. Heta has spoiled us young men - but whatever happens to me, the village remains. That's what kept me going. I dreamt that my ties to the village - were cut and I couldn't return. I was separated from the village. In thought and deed. I was a man without substance. And the villagers, too. It was terrible. The jail was hell. - Days Later at the Public Hall the Women Hold a Ceremony - Buddah, we honour and worship you. The morning glory is bedecked with dew only in the morning That's the only time it is alive Buddah, like the flower, we, too, are shortlived We believe in the Buddah We cannot be without prayer While we offer prayers to you We are in your holy garden Flowers are from the heavens The brilliant, holy five colours When we pick the flowers And gaze on them Every flower Every single flower They are all imprinted with your prayer Praise to The Lord Buddah I believe in the Lord Buddah - Will They Come to Destroy the Village? - We thank Narita Shibayama Opposition Alliance Group & Heta Opposition Alliance Group.
