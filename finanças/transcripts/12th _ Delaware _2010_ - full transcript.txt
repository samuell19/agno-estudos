Arnold, you know, god wants to get close to you. Look, let god into your life. Don't... this work is not gonna help you. This is... this is the work of the devil. Oh, Candace, why are you doing this kind of work? You could do so much. You could help people so much more because you're a nice lady. God wants you too... especially wants you, Candace, to be close to him. Can't you do some other kind of work? This is not right. You have grandchildren. Don't you know how precious they are? These little babies are precious. Life is precious. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, amen. - Holy Mary... - man: Ain't the dogs come out? I'd like to offer this to you, miss. - We can help you. - Man: We got a place next door. - Y'all can? Then give me some money. - Maybe we can help you out. We'll help you out right next door. That's what they do. Mary: Oh, mothers... please, dear mothers. Mothers... you're a mother of a baby right now. Don't have this abortion. Choose life. Woman: You need to know the facts about abortion. God made you pregnant. It's not a mistake. We're here to help you. There is so much help available. Even right across the street there's help. Come on, please. Wait... Think about yourself. 95% of women will tell you they regret their abortion. You're not gonna be different. This just makes everything worse. Trust me. Oh, where's my baby? Around this time he goes for the... killer... That's what an abortionist is... And he'll zoom out of here in his white... In his yellow... what's that? A car, mustang, or whatever it's called. I don't know cars. But that's what he does. Then he'll come back a half an hour later with the... Ahem, quotation marks... "doctor" under a sheet. I don't know what they tell the people inside what we do. - See, there he goes. Here he goes. See, and I'll stand... I'll stand in front of the car 'cause I know his sched... Oh, hi there, miss. Hi. You know, you haven't got much time for the baby to live. But... I know, it's not your... but it's... This is your baby... this... No, but you're here to help this woman have an abortion. Hello, Arnold. Hi. Hello, Arnold. See this? Huh? Huh? See these little babies here? Look at this... This was your granddaughter. That's your granddaughter that you love so much. This is your granddaughter. That's how she was. And these are the size of these babies here. Why do you do this kind of work, Arnold, huh? That's choice for you, right? That's choice. Okay, it shows positive. Okay? It shows you at about 10 weeks, okay? Which is about this size here. Okay? You can hold it. - Okay? - Mm-hmm. Um, are you surprised? It's okay. It's okay to be nervous, all right? Just wanna let you know that. So we would like to offer you an ultrasound, okay? Is that something that you think your mom would like to be here for? Are you close with your mom? - Not really. - Not really? Okay. Do you wanna have your sister come in? - Her test has shown positive. - Ugh! Widline... Woman: You can put her at 11:30. Anne: She just got out of school. She's 15. She's in school. She's not communicating at all. Just turns her head. I wanna go inside. I just wanna get it done with. Brittney? Well, actually I'll just see brittney first, okay? - Man: Okay. - All right. You can have a seat. When you say one pregnancy, are you counting this as a pregnancy or you had a previous pregnancy? - I had one before. - You had one before? - It ended in abortion or it ended in miscarriage or... - an abortion. So you're considering abortion as your number-one option? Yeah, I don't feel ready for... for the baby. I don't have insurance. I don't have a job, you know. What motivated the abortion decision the first time? - Um, I think... - just the same... just uncertainty or... No, I... in the beginning I wanted to keep it, but my mom didn't want me to because she said that it was gonna ruin my life and stuff. So I just... I don't know. I didn't want my mom to be mad at me and... I don't know. Do you think she would react the same now? I think she'd be more mad. - Yeah? - Now, yeah. - I think she'd be really upset. - Yeah. - I don't really wanna tell her. - Right. Well, you know, at this point there's not really a whole... There's not reason, really, to rush off to tell her. Looks like you'd be at about seven weeks. - Okay. - Okay? Seven weeks is about this size here... The littlest one. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Okay? - The growth is pretty quickly. - Yeah. Yeah, they grow pretty quickly. It's kind of an amazing thing. - And that's how big it is? - Mm-hmm, yeah. That's how big he is at seven weeks. You can take him out. We can get you in to have an ultrasound and just... You know, so you know we do offer free ultrasound, because it's a visual, you know? It shows you what's happening inside there. Got him. - Woman: There's the baby right there. - Mm-hmm. If you look real close, you can see his little heart beating. Right there. If you look real close, it's flickering. - It's quiet, but you can hear it. - Mm-hmm. Anne: You can see it too. - Woman: There, you see? - Oh, yeah. Man: Oh my gosh. It's pretty tiny, but definitely there with the heartbeat. - That's crazy. - Right? Um... Anne: And the baby doubles in size every week, so next week it'll be twice that. - Man: Wow. - In the beginning they grow at an amazing rate. Yeah, like you can see... This is seven weeks and this is eight weeks. You know? So they do grow pretty quickly. Man: Oh, yeah. Wow. You want me to drive? Hmm? - Huh? - I'll drive. I'll drive. Gosh... "Hi, mommy and daddy." - That's tough. - I know. Tony: You're not defending it. You're letting it be murdered. It's the same thing as have somebody kidnap your son and beat him to death. The difference is your son can speak up. This child cannot speak. So someone has to stand up for it. You're not. And you can ignore me all you want. You can ignore me all you want. You're gonna stand before god and before Jesus... Have to give account of this. What are you gonna say? "Oh, I didn't want it"? "I couldn't afford it"? Wrong answer. - I have one for your record books. - Huh? For your memories of freaky things that happen in the United States. It's this breaking news on the operation rescue website. Philadelphia women's center on Tuesday had free abortions in honor of George tiller. - That's not a joke? - This is totally not a joke. Yes, and they're proud of it. They did it in honor of tiller, late-term abortionist. - That's crazy. - Yeah. Sick. - Well, here they come. - Yeah. They came down the other way of the street. Anne: You wonder what's the, like, keyword. You know, "we're in" or "cover down" or... you know. Man: Come on out. Oh my gosh, could you imagine if it came out like an albino? - Oh. - Don't worry. Girl: No, like, white hair and red eyes. Oh my god. No, it really is. I know an albino person. This is Satan's baby. Ew. You can get breast cancer from an abortion? Girl #2: I don't know, man. Girl: That's, like, not cool though. It's scary. Hello, brittney? Hi, this is Anne calling from the pregnancy care center. How are you? Good good. I was... I was hoping that I'd be able to reach you today. You doing okay? Yeah? How... You're what? Did you... did you make any progress towards making a decision or... How are you? Yeah? And? Yeah. Did you go through with it already? Yeah? Well... Yeah. Okay. She aborted. She aborted. That was very quick. They must have aborted on Saturday. I'm sure they did it across the street. I'm sure. I think that even though it's hard and, you know, I go through things like this, my situation makes me the perfect person to do a job like this. I'm an unmarried person with very few responsibilities in terms of other things that I have to tend to. It's basically my two dogs and myself that I have charge of, you know. And... I think I'm at a point where I do really understand that this battle is just so vicious and that the evil is... So powerful and so brutal that I really think god's doing everything he can. It will end. I know that. I just don't think it's gonna be pretty. Anne: The abortion clinic in fort Pierce is run by a wife and a husband. They're doing it because that's their paycheck. It's like walking into a car dealership... They want to sell you a car. And walking into an abortion clinic... They want to sell you an abortion. You're not going to get the truth. You're not gonna get neutrality. You're gonna get a sales pitch. Clearly our competition is the abortion clinic. We are actually on opposite sides of the street. You know, abortion clinic, pregnancy care center. You know, darkness and light. You know, death and life. I mean, it doesn't get more distinct than that. We have two women who call... She's fearless or she's fearful. That's it. If she's fearless, she's not even saying hello. She's, "hey, how much do you charge for abortion?" I need to make an appointment for an abortion." She's often times rushed. If you don't hook her right away, she hangs up on you. When she calls and she says, "do you do abortions?" I say, "are you calling for yourself or are you calling for your friend?" She says, "I'm calling for myself." I say, "well, when did you have a pregnancy test?" And we engage in conversation. Because if she calls and says, "do you do abortions?" And I say no... click. They're not always sure who they're calling anyway. They don't know if they're calling us or the abortion clinic. But again, I'm not trying to talk her out of it. I'm trying to get her in the door. Take control of the conversation. There's a lot at stake here. I don't mind the criticisms of "taking control" doesn't... that doesn't sound fair. That doesn't sound... Well, then too bad. You walk her to the room, you sit her down, you close the door, you excuse yourself and you come back. It's okay that they're sit in the room by themselves, because inevitably what do they do when they're in there by themselves? They read. And since we're the ones putting out what is read in the room, we know it's good information. And there's no deceit in this, okay? There's no deceit. Trust me. And whenever I have any doubt about any direction, I ask father Tom. Look at this morally. You know, look at this from an ethical point of view. Is this okay to say? Is this okay to do? And he examines it. And trust me, if it weren't okay, he wouldn't allow me to do it. Here, Arnold, see the baby? See? See the little baby, huh? Doctor, you don't have to do this kind of work. These are what you kill. Huh? Look. Are those... scumbag. Father Tom euteneuer: When we dedicate ourselves heart and soul to pro-life, we are doing something prophetic. My friends, as we go on in our society in the future, I predict that it's going to get a lot more difficult to be pro-life. The forces on the other side are solidifying their power... Their political power, their social power... And they're becoming more militant against us... Because the abortion industry is more and more looking like a diabolical religion. Think about it. In the United States, most of the abortions are done in these free-standing abortion clinics. They're like temples because inside that clinic you have an altar, which is the abortion table. On that altar they offer up a blood sacrifice. It's ritualized blood sacrifice. There's got to be demons involved in that. There are policemen who protect it. They're kind of like their guardian angels. They have their hierarchy called planned parenthood. They have their dogma called choice, and they enforce that dogma. For them it's an infallible dogma. So my friends, we're talking about something deeply diabolical at the core of our country because the forces that we are fighting are not flesh and blood, but they are the powers of darkness. Anne: Arnold does all the pick-up of the abortionists and they use a bright yellow mustang. This is supposed to be not drawing attention to the whole abortionists coming in to the abortion, though? And you can hear the car... Voom... start up. In fact, in my office I can hear it. They painted their building gaudy orange. They... we don't know what their tactic was on that, but it might have been a way for them to be able to say to their own clients, you know, "come to the bright orange building as opposed to that other one," because they thought they might have been getting too many... Losing too many clients to this place. It hasn't really impacted... I mean, we still get women coming in here thinking they're going there. So we... we attract them. Now if they move somewhere else, yeah, we'd have to think about that because I think there's an important value in being as close as you can. They did move from port Saint Louis up here. And I was at both places. Now I remember the time when they had the fence up in front of the place. They put the fence up because we were talking to women, you know, and we were effective in taking them away. But the fence went up and so we decided that... Or I decided that I would talk to women over the fence by bringing a ladder and getting on top of the ladder and talking to them over the fence. And so of course that generated a 911 call because I was now talking down to women. Oh my... Cop. I don't know. It's gonna be a hard one. Very hard. Anne: She's totally abortion-minded. It's just like abortion logic, you know? She has two other kids, da-da da-da. I got to scan her today. I don't wanna lose her. If I make her come back, she might not. Do you remember the one day I was in the client... In the counseling room with... Like, six hours with that girl and jan was like, "so like now their new strategy is lock 'em in" till they decide to keep the baby?" It's just like her. Okay, Victoria, it does show positive, okay? The nurse can scan you today. - It wouldn't be right away. - Okay. I know you said you were hungry, okay? I'm actually hungry too. No no no, I'm gonna treat you. Yeah. Just tell me. - Thank you. - Yeah. Lunch is here. Okay, um, let's see. Ahem, how old is he? - The same age. - The same age? Well, he's 23. I'm 24. But he's not the best boyfriend, huh? I don't think so. I don't think so. He is verbally abusive and... He's verbally abusive? - Yes. - Yeah? For all you know, the baby changes him. I have no idea. I don't know. But you know, I mean, you're putting yourself through a surgery, through an emotional trauma in order to not be more tied to him or not to extend your relationship with him. I mean, as a mom of two already, I have to do what's best for me and my kids. I've seen it so many times over that you think you're suffering's not gonna be too much. I'm still waiting for a woman to sit where you're sitting and tell me, "I'm not suffering from my abortion." I'm not regretful. I'm not depressed. "I'm glad I did it." I know for a fact that I won't regret it. I don't know for a fact that I won't be depressed. Maybe I will. I don't know for a fact that... That I won't stress about it. Looking at the pictures stress me out. I'm... I'm like, you know, all like... You know, that's... that's bad. It kind of... You know, it hurts me. But that's what abortions are for. Abortions are to terminate unwanted pregnancies. This pregnancy is unwanted. I will have no regrets at all. The only regrets that I have is sleeping with him... Sleeping with him without a condom that one time. You know, that's all it takes is one time. - That's what I regret. - That's all it takes is one time, but condoms... - That's what I regret. - Reality check here... Condoms are only effective 85% of the time, okay? - So even using a condom... - Yeah. Doesn't save you. - Yeah, but 99.9%... - No, 85%. - Condoms are 85%? - Are 85% effectiveness. Okay, well, all the times I used condoms, I never got pregnant. The times that I haven't used condoms, that's when I get pregnant. That's what I'm gonna base this off. If I'd used a condom, I wouldn't be pregnant. - I'm gonna step outside and make a phone call. - Oh, sure. Go ahead. It'll just be a couple of minutes - on the ultrasound anyway. - Okay. Man, this bitch is getting on my fucking nerve. You know, if I have this baby, she's not gonna take care of it. She's not gonna get up in the middle of the night, make a bottle for me. She's not gonna be there. Well, the thing is, I don't... I don't care. Like, don't try to talk me out of nothing. I told her my mind is made up. And in a few minutes I'm fixin' to get the ultrasound so I can get the hell up outta here. - She's ready. - Okay. - Was the parking lot full when you came in? - Yeah. Or in the front wasn't... In the front. - Oh, I didn't know about the front. - Oh, okay. I was getting ready to go here, but I didn't see any... Some days are, uh, busier than... than others. - Is that it? - Woman: Um... There appears to be something there, but I can't confirm it yet. Victoria: I'm sure she probably does that a lot because of the way she did it to me. I mean, she offered to buy me food. I found that crazy because, you know, I reached in my pocketbook. I had my own money. Maybe she thought because she bought me some McDonald's that was gonna change my mind, but... They're some, like, anti-abortion... I see a baby doll right there. I don't know. I feel like it's kind of crazy for them to just sit out of an abortion clinic. I mean, the baby has nothing to do with them. I don't know. When your mind is made up, though, it can't be stopped. - Woman: Are you the one with the sign? - Yeah. I just have a few questions about it. - Why are you parked in there? - Why am I parking there? - This is an abortion clinic. - I understand what it is. - Okay. - I had to park somewhere to talk to you. - So park over there. - Well, I'm already parked. - Okay. - That's not what I'm worried about. I just would... I wanna understand why you guys use signs pointing to this building saying... - Because they perform abortions here. - "Baby killers"? Okay... Number one, the Bible says not to judge. What is that doing? - The Bible also... - Pointing the finger. - There's a difference. You're misinterpreting it. - No no no. - Yeah, you are. - How about the sign you guys hold out here - in front of the school for these little children... - Right. With a baby torn apart? Why are you shooting the messenger? They're the ones performing abortions, not us. - I'm not shooting the messenger. - Yeah, you are. I'm just trying to let you guys know... - This place was here first. - That this is not helping. I just have to pass this every day - and it just disgusts me because... - it disgusts you? How do you think god feels about it? So how do you think god feels about it? He's creating these children... - when you're holding up signs... - Please let me finish. - God creates us in the womb, yes? - Yes, he does. They're being destroyed here. They're being murdered. Right, I understand that completely. That takes "precedent" over everything. - If you do not value life, then what do you value? - Okay. That takes precedence over everything. Okay, well, I'm not gonna keep repeating myself. Woman: Keep pointing the finger. Go ahead. Woman #2: We're not pointing fingers. We wanna close this place down. Tony, she's just giving her opinion. Unfortunately, she's been manipulated by the enemy because if she knew better, she would not be parked there... - no, she's being an overprotective mom. - She's being a f... Her son or daughter goes to this school. You know? Tony: When the owner of the abortion clinic goes to pick up the abortionist, he's covered with a sheet so that we cannot see who this person is. His identity is hidden from us so we don't harm him. Now what has come to light to me within the past month is I've discovered, thanks through god, that I know where the owner of the abortion clinic meets the abortionists. I know where he picks them up and where he drops them off. Right now what I wanna do is I wanna check the super Wal-Mart and see if one of the doctors is parked there... If it's the doctor I'd seen the last time, if that's his vehicle. That's him. It is the same guy. Okay. 'Cause I've watched him and this is the same plate. That's him. Little do they know little old me is following them. This is the part of doing this that drive you crazy. You just have to wait. I've been talking to a few people, a very small circle of people, about this information and hoping that they have contacts with people that can take this information and... bring it to light, tell me who the names are, where they live, et cetera, et cetera. And then... And then I was thinking of doing... is making a fairly big billboard, probably like 4x4, with a picture of the abortionist and say "this doctor performs abortions." I'm not worried about the risks. I'm not worried about any of that. I'm not concerned about that because this is worth it. This is life and death we're dealing with here and these people just don't see it that way. Somebody came up with the idea that it's a woman's right. It's her body. She can do what she wants. Well, unfortunately, that is not true. Ho-ho, yes! He came in a different direction. He just... the owner of the abortion clinic dropped him off. Opens up the car, goes in. It's as if nothing happened. He's just living his life, walking through it... La-di-da-da, as if nothing happened. He's just going about his everyday life. Has no effect on him. He could be going home to spend the day with his family and that just totally sickens me to death. He just performed abortions and then he's going home and being affectionate to his wife or his... And his children. That just tears me up. Candace: We had a chiropractor across the street and he put his building up for sale. The sign went up one day, it literally came down the next day... within 24 hours. And it was them. They are relentless. They just... They never stop. I mean, they don't have a life. Evidently, they don't have a life. I mean, every once in a while we think about, oh, we can go do a protest on their corner of the street, but we don't have time. We're too busy raising grandkids and kids and working and making a living and living our lives. We're not obsessed with them, you know? If they would just stay on their side of the street and do what they've got to do... And whatever they do over there, I just... Oh, and I think one of them just showed up. Lots of times they leave signs that they bring with them. And there's a... that one big bloody fetus sign that shows the head, the arms, the legs. They say it's eight weeks and... Which is a bunch of junk. They left it out there by the telephone pole or the pole out there, and we grabbed it and brought it in. We take them home and destroy them. All right, first things first here. Let's see, 46 years old. I'm still older than you. "Do you have any doubts about your decision today to terminate your pregnancy?" "Very very small ones." Explain that to me. What kind of doubts are you having? It's okay. Just I have no children. And, um, in my 30s I got rheumatoid and they told me not to get pregnant. Then I got divorced and I'm with a great guy, but only four months. But I'm 46, and if I have this baby, I'll be 47. When that baby's 20, I'll be 67. Those are the reasons I'm doing this... - Simply age. - Age? I don't know if I'll be physically able in my 50s to handle a toddler. I wanna do it now before the child gets older in my womb. Okay. Okay. Well, as long as you're okay with everything, everything else will be okay. We just wanna make sure that... That this is definitely what you need to do, not want to do. Nobody ever wants to do this, okay? Nobody ever wants to do this. But if it's what you need to do... And it's your decision only. - Nobody's forcing you to do this? - No. I take the responsibility to heart. I can see you're a very serious person. Okay. Woman: Call upon your god. Call upon your god. Woman: Arnold, this is somebody's grandchildren here. Somebody's grandchildren. I would be ashamed too if I were you. I would be ashamed. I pick up the doctors because I do protect them. The sheet is to cover them up so they won't know who they are, so they won't recognize them. And then they go to their houses and they protest over there. So we don't want them to do that. I do worry about Candace. When she's out there by herself, you know, I tell her all the time to come back home before it gets dark. "Shot in the back three times at close range" as he arrived to perform abortions. "Police say Griffin has admitted the slaying." Hmm. "Second doctor's death closes clinic." Yeah, they got a replacement and that doctor was killed too. Thank god none of my doctors got killed. Thank god. The physicians that I know are very cautious about where they park their cars, who... They have guns. They carry weapons. They wear bulletproof vests. You try to protect them, but there's only so much you can do. There's only so much you can do. And then if they quit or get killed, where's the next doctor coming from? He did move that camera closer to the building. That's the alley, so we can see them when they're trying to get on our property, get too close to the building. October 8th of 2000... We had a fire that started in this room that was undetermined, but they thought the fax machine kind of started it. But they pulled the plug out from the wall and there was nothing wrong with the plug. So it didn't start with the fax machine. I suspect foul play, that someone... It was arson. I do. But I'm not a fire marshal. I'm not an expert on fire or arson or anything. I know nothing about it. But I just know that was an awful year and we were closed for six months and it... We almost lost everything. No, it looks pretty quiet. Did you hear about yesterday? Yeah. So that's why I do think they are killing. I just don't know when. Man: All right, ladies. The abortionist is here. You still have time. It's not too late. You still have time not to go through this procedure that you're gonna regret for the rest of your life. Man: Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, amen. Man: When I say love, you say babies. - Love. - Crowd: Babies. - Love. - Crowd: Babies. - Love. - Crowd: Babies. Unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, o loving, o sweet virgin Mary. ♪ Hey hey, you you, we don't like abortion ♪ ♪ No way, no way, got to save the babies. ♪ For the past 14 years, we pro-lifers have had it easy. That's all changed. Elections do have consequences. Man: What god has promised to all... the right to life... No man, including president Barack Obama, can take away. - Get ready to say yes to life. - Crowd: Yes! We may have lost an election, we have not lost the war. Man #2: You cannot outlast us and we will defeat you! Anne: It's a right to free speech. I mean, I just got back from Washington where there was a block full of these signs in front of the white house. It would strike me as very curious, you know, that there would be a city of fort Pierce ordinance that can overrule the constitution. Yeah. There is a thing that says "obscene pictures." - I don't see anything obscene, so I'm not worried about it. - Okay. The major point here is we need to make sure you stay off of their property. Oh yeah, nobody's interested in that. Nobody has any interest in being on their property. - You're staying or you're going? - I'm staying. Okay. Do you recognize anybody out there? The only one I recognize is Cheryl, the one with the life mobile Van. - Oh, that. - She's across the street though, talking to somebody. I'm surprised James ain't out there. But I don't recognize all the older people. - There's someone out there with a Walker. - A Walker? She's sitting on it. That's ridiculous. Candace: Started this a long time ago... All the little brochures that they hand out on the sidewalk that we have kept or... Just collected over the years. "Complications of abortion." Possible immediate complications: Excessive bleeding, possibly causing removal of the uterus "and a resulting inability to have children." Oh, what language. Breast cancer. There's been so many studies done on the breast cancer thing and they all deny that. And one... and one of the physicians that I've worked with for many many years says that if that's true, everybody who has a miscarriage would get breast cancer, and that's just not true. I... I don't know where they get their medical information from, but I know that's totally wrong. I've had patients who have booked an appointment. I've given them directions on how to get here and they get confused because on the other side of Delaware and south 12th street is that pregnancy care center... That sounds so nice. The patients get confused and go to the wrong building. It's like two hours later and the girl will ask, "well, when am I getting my abortion?" "Oh, we don't do abortions here." That's when the patient figures out that she's in the wrong place. - Stop. - Why? ♪ Nervous nervous nervous ♪ ♪ Nervous nervous nervous ♪ - ♪ Nervous nervous nervous. ♪ - Shut up. That's your name for the day... Nervous, miss nervous. What do you think is the motivating factor for... - Me to get this? - Yeah. My future and... I can't take care of a baby right now. I'm only in 11th grade. I'm 17. I turn 18 in December. I can't take on the responsibility of a baby by myself. I just can't do it right now. Do you really know what you choose when you choose abortion? You will be given an anesthetic... Two needles... into the cervix. The doctor would use the force of the suction to essentially tear it apart... all the limbs. The head would be crushed and the doctor would be using it to pull out the baby basically piece by piece. And then it winds up, in the end, in a little jar. You can't just walk around with, you know, pieces of the decaying fetus inside your body without developing an infection. If a toe or a finger or a piece of the baby is left inside, then that produces a risk for you. Narrator: In some cases, the patient will experience bleeding that is heavy enough to require a transfusion or hysterectomy. In the most serious of these instances, she will die. Can you cut it off? I can't see it. - Anne: You don't wanna see it? - No. Wanna go with the computer animated? There's no blood. It's not real bodies. It's computer. - That was a real one? - That's real. - Kind of scary. - Yeah. I hate my life. Yes yes! Yes! Two in one day. Ashante is keeping her baby. We thought this one was Gonzo. - Woman: Priggins? - Priggins. I couldn't freakin' believe it. She got up to the point... She made an appointment in Fort Lauderdale. Never went. Never went! Widline: I'm seven months pregnant now. I didn't want no child at this age right now because people will look down at me and say I won't be nothing. I tried everything in my powers to get rid of it, like drinking vinegar and, like, lifting heavy stuff up and moving heavy stuff around. Anne told me about abortion. A woman... she can, like, lose her life over abortion or don't have kids at all no more in the future. So, um, I didn't wanna take that risk. I don't think he's gonna, like... It's gonna be harder with the baby. I think I'm gonna get a lot of help. I hope so. Is this the abortion clinic? Candace: Yes, it is, hon. Come on in. - Across the street? - Yes. And she made me watch this video of a surgical abortion. It was very vivid and showed everything. It was gruesome. It was like watching a scary movie. Just like... There was so much blood and all these... It was just disgusting. There's not blood all over the surgery room, sweetie-pie. I promise you. Abortion is one of the safest procedures. It is safer than having full-term delivery. It's safer than having your tonsils out. There's not blood all over the place. I promise you. You did an ultrasound already? Yes, I took one across the street. - And how far along did they say you were? - I just went Wednesday. They told me I was seven weeks, two days. - This past Wednesday? - Yeah. - Seven weeks, two days? - Yes. And two weeks before that, they told me I was five and a half weeks. When was your last period... first day? - August 13th. - I think that would... - Okay, August. And it's October, right? - Yes. That would make you, according to this, 10 weeks and one day. Between 10 and 11. Well, we'll find out, okay? See, because... No way. On a chart that I have, 3.5... That would be considered 10 weeks. - 10 weeks? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, they told me I was seven weeks, two days. Okay, so you're only gonna pay $400 total. I'm gonna take $50 off to have it done. - Okay. - Okay? - Good? Yeah? - Mm-hmm, yeah. - Okay, baby. Okay. - Okay. I'll see you next Friday at 9:30, honey. Okay? All right. Man: No, these are not my words. These are the words of... Candace: The pregnancy care center that's across the street from us... They told her she was seven weeks. They lie to patients about how many weeks they are so they think they have plenty of time to think about it a little bit longer. I don't even think it's to get them to change their mind. I think it's to have them be too far so they can't get it done. That's what I think. Or have to go to another state, another county, because clinics usually go up to, like, 12, 14 weeks, and that's it. I... I don't get them people. I just don't get them people. It makes me wanna... Makes me wanna cry. Don't even... I don't even know why, but I do... I wanna cry today, because that's... I just wanna go over there and shake them people and be all like, "what the fuck are you doing?" Why are you messing up these girls' lives? "Why are you playing around with them like that?" Oh. Anne: Ooh. No. Arnold. Arnold. Arnold, brother, let's speak. Come talk to me. I haven't talked to you for a while. Let's talk. Euteneuer: Of the father, of the son and of the holy spirit, amen. We offer this rosary for all of our regular pro-life intentions, especially the end to the evil of abortion, the conversion of all abortionists, to the conversion of those who come to this place, those who work at this place, those who support this work. Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. - Amen. - Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. - Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now... And at the hour of our death, amen. - Holy Mary... - Pray for us. - Holy mother of god... - Pray for us. - Holy virgin of virgins... - Pray for us. - Mother of Christ... - Pray for us. - Mother of divine grace... - Pray for us. - Mother most pure... - Pray for us. - Mother most chaste... - Pray for us. - Mother inviolate... - Pray for us. - Mother undefiled... - Pray for us. - Mother most amiable... - Pray for us. - Mother most admirable... - Pray for us. - Mother of good counsel... - Pray for us. - Mother of our creator... - Pray for us. You know what? No more sex. He can't have any unless he wears a condom. - Are you married to him? He's your husband, right? - Yeah. You got to fight it. That means take birth control pills, - use condoms... - But you know... He's got to use condoms. No, you're not stupid. You just got to be more careful. They don't care. They're like... They're like dogs. They're like dogs. - Yeah, I swear. - Yeah. How old are your babies? You're not a mon... You would be a monster if you... If you had a baby and then mistreated it. Oh... Don't cry, sweetie-pie. Don't cry. Now are you like this because you're pregnant? A lot of girls get kind of like this because they're pregnant. They have hormones and it just goes zzz. You never wanted to do this? What's hurting you? To have the abortion? So why are you making yourself do this? You are young. You can have babies later on. You really can. If you can't... I don't want you to do this if you don't want to do it. I mean, nobody ever wants to actually do it. But, you know, if it's what you need to do to take care of you and the kids... If you feel that way, why are you making yourself do it? Mm-hmm. Good afternoon. A woman's world medical center. How can I help you? Tomorrow morning you'd have to be here at 6:30 in the morning, okay? We do want you to bring your photo I.D. With you, a pair of socks, and we don't want you to eat anything after midnight tonight. And when you get here in the morning, there may or may not be protesters outside. If they are out there, just ignore them. Come inside. Yeah, if you needed to, we could send the lab tech out to walk up with you if you felt more comfortable. Are you the father of this baby? Don't give up your rights. It's not a dead baby yet. You come out, you're gonna be the mother of a dead baby and the whole family tree line is kaput. Woman: These are the facts. I know women that have had abortions and were never able to have a baby again. And the only baby that they had is a dead one. She is... she is thinking about it, but she wants help, money help. I'll do it today. Whatever. - Today. - Whatever you need... Whatever you need... I will go to the bank today. Whatever you need, I'll help you. Even if you have babies, I'll give them clothes. I'll give you money to help you with your rent, your gas, whatever you need, ma'am. Whatever you need. I'm not lying. I tell you the truth. Please. I let you talk to the family. Tell her I'll let her talk to the family. Woman: Right now. Hola. I'm Jim. Everything's free. Everything's free. Come on in. Come on in with... okay. Jim: Yeah, she did great, didn't she? Oh my god. Oh, thank you, lord. Candace: If they really did change her mind, that's fine. I just don't know who they think they are to try and control somebody they don't even know. They talk that person into having another baby and they promise her everything in the world to get her to keep it, and then they don't deliver. I've heard that story over and over again. Jim: You think you're crying now? I'm telling you, we see these women come in here, cry cry cry. They can't stop because they think, "what did I do?" What did I do?" And you're a nice person. We can tell. You know, you would never hurt anybody. You love children, right? You have six children. Okay? I wanna give... come here, I wanna give you a present. Come here.
