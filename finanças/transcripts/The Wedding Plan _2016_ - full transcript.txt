- Have they been inside for long? - A few minutes. I got the fish. They're in the fridge. - What color bags, honey? - Black, two bags. - Are you coming for Shabbat? - No, I'm going to Grandpa's. God bless. And take out the garbage, honey. Sure. That's my son Shimi, bless his soul. He owns a wedding hall in Jerusalem. Nothing fancy, but... the food's delicious. 120 shekels a plate, bring 250 people and he'll give you a discount. God willing. - What's your name, sweetie? - Michal. How badly do you want to marry? - Very. - Stop lying- Why would I lie? - Want to knead the dough? - Sure. Come here. Knead it, with your fists. Really dig in. Harder, sweat it out. It's good for you. Enough, I think you killed the dough. It has a strong smell. That means you're full of the evil eye. How long have you been waiting? 11 years. Okay, stop now. Separate it. There are two bags there. Amen. - What now? - Come sit down. It's all right, don't be afraid. Everything's fine. Give me your hand. What do you want? To get married. Don't lie. - What? - Don't be a joker. I don't want to be alone. That's not what I asked you. What are you gonna do with that fish? - Sweetheart... - No, it really stinks. Want me to stop? No. What do you want? Love. I want love. What else? - To please God. - Stop lying. It's not a lie. Speak freely, sweetheart. You're safe with me. What should I say? Honey, you're funny, but cut it out. If you don't tell the truth, how can we clear the obstacles? What do you want? I want... I want to be normal. Mm-hmm. I want... to be respected. I want people to respect me because I have a spouse. - Okay. - I'm sick of feeling humiliated. I want to invite people over for shabbat. I'm sick of being invited. - I get it. - I want to make Shabbat with a man. I don't want to be alone anymore. I want someone to sing to me. - It'll happen, don't worry. - I'm sick of being handicapped. But you're beautiful, sweetheart, you're good. I want stability and I want to live. You're already alive. I want to give and I want to receive. I want to love and be loved back. - You will. - That's what I want. You will. - That's it? - Yes. Clean yourself, you're a mess. Tell Shimi I said to cut you a deal. Other side, too. Yuck. Shall we start? Let's wait till everything's served. Oh, right. Okay. Everything okay? - Everything's great. - You sure? Totally. Good. Let's start anyway, before it gets cold. What's going on, Gidi? Nothing. Why do I sense it isn't nothing? - You're doing it again. - Doing what? Over-analyzing. I just want to know why you're so distant. It's called breathing. Do I suffocate you? Sometimes. I'm no fun. You haven't started yet? It'll get cold. Here's some chicken wings. And some chicken breast. Thank you. Are you on a diet? Eat! I'll be in my office if you need anything. - Great. - Thanks. - Bon appétit. - Thanks. What do you want to taste first? I don't know. What do you prefer? We could discuss that too, if you want. Okay... Let's start with the chicken wings. All right. Amen. Come on, Gidi, what's going on? You tell me. What do you mean? It feels like you're looking for a fight. Not at all. I just wonder why you haven't been nice all week. Where are you going with this? What do you want me to say? Nothing, I just wonder why you've been so distant since we got engaged. It's normal. Okay, elaborate on that. I'm 36, I'm getting married for the first and only time, so not everything is rosy all the time, Michal. Define "not rosy." - Why? - I really want to understand you. It's nothing, it could only ruin things. Ruin things. It's that bad? - What do you want? - To know what's eating you. Even if it could ruin everything? If it's that bad, wouldn't it be better to know now? I don't want to tell you. - You have to. - No, I don't. - You can't take it back now. - Something's wrong with you. Please tell me. I'm begging you. I don't love you. Thank you. She doesn't want a hug now, Feigi. That's okay. Come on, it isn't... He just panicked. He'll put it aside and call to apologize. For sure. Count. 10, 9, 8, 7... You should call him. You want my life to be as messed up as yours? Leave me out of this, it's not the same. I promise you playing princess isn't the right move. How are you? Did he call? I called him a thousand times. He didn't call back. Do you think I'm ugly? You're laughing? It's not funny. I did the math. I've been dating for 10 years, right? That adds up to a 490-hour date with 123 guys. - How long can a person date? - Quit. What does that mean? Quit. Tell me how. Just do nothing? I feel like eating a steak. Steak. Oh, sorry. Yes, Mom? Calm down, I can't understand you. Oh, come on... Okay, where is she? Stop hiding like a worm! Be a man and come down here, Sag“! - Lady, please stop. - Chicken! Tum around and walk away. Fine, just tell him to be a man, and to face me. Stop or I'll have to bring you in. Sagi! Tell the cop to get the hell out of here! Get into the patrol car. But he said he'd never leave me, he swore! Honey... - Michal, tell him. - Okay, okay. You're a loser, Sagi! Get her out of here. - You'll come back to me! - This is my last warning! - I'm taking care of it. - I can walk, Michal. Okay, okay- He called a cop... When you aren't screaming at him you're begging him to stay. Michal, are you on my side? Actually, you drive me nuts. - I gotta go. - Where? He leaves for work in 10 minutes. You'll get arrested! He'll never press charges. How do you know? He is my husband. End of story. I know him better than he knows himself. He needs me to need him. Fine, go to him but no more of this drama. - I can't keep coming here. - You don't have to. We're fine. And it'll end when it's meant to. By the way, I think we had a breakthrough today. What? He didn't come down when the cop showed up. If he'd come down... but he didn't. Call you later with an update. Who knows, my sister's so confident maybe it'll work out. Well, men aren't fans of needy women. I gotta get ready. What time is it? Where are you going? I'm meeting the guy Rabbi Brand fixed me up with. - What guy? - The guy who converted. Who are you talking about? - I don't feel like going. - Why not? Okay, because he's Japanese. Japanese? He's a Japanese guy who converted. Cool. Sounds interesting. Yeah, right... - Say, did you give Ziv... - Don't change the subject. - Who is he? How old? - It doesn't matter. I can tell you right now we have nothing in common. It's intriguing, he's from Japan. Eat sushi, do origami. You just think he's the only guy I'm gonna get. - Why would you say that? - I don't wanna talk about it. - Then don't. - I'm not. I can't see myself going back. Going back where? I can't picture myself waiting for another guy, another date, another year, another decade. I need a change. A' Two half-souls, we came into this world A' - What's so funny? - Just that you sang "gloom" instead of "groom" so I wondered if you're getting - married or divorced. - I'm already married. - Sorry. - Sorry for what? I don't know. What don't you know? I don't know, I just thought you looked single. I don't know why... I don't know why I thought you weren't married. You okay? Yes, thank God. You sure? Of course, I'm getting married. Okay- - Can I help you with something? - Yes. How much will it cost us to reserve the hall for 200 guests? Is this some kind of joke? Why a joke? You aren't marrying Gidi. Right? Uh...no. I guess not. Gidi isn't the groom. Is there another groom? Of course. That's why I want to reserve the hall. Your mom said you'd give me a good price for over 250 guests but I want a good price for 200, including a buffet. - Okay. - How much? 8th night of Hanukkah? Yes, 22 days from now. How much? 15,000 shekels will do. You're a character, Michal. So I am. I just hope you're not going crazy on me. - I'm not crazy. - Really? I'm getting married, on the 8th night of Hanukkah. But who's the groom? I have a hall. I have a dress. The apartment is almost ready. By the end of Hanukkah. Marta, you hear that? Michal's getting married and she doesn't have a groom yet. - Feigi. - What do you mean? Let's hear what she thinks. You can't get married without a groom. There will be one. I don't understand. Marta, don't you believe God can find me a groom by the end of Hanukkah? He can. - But maybe He doesn't want to? - Why? - It doesn't work like that. - How do you know? - Come on... - I believe that if I'm 100% sure that God will find me one. He will. Why? No offense, but who do you think you are? The Talmud says, "The world was created for me." - Well, lucky you. - But why does that bother you? You need to take it down a notch and lose the arrogance, okay? Or God won't give me what I want? - It's possible. - Why? Maybe it's not what you need. If it is, will He give it to me? - I don't know. - Why, is He cruel? No. But we can't understand God's ways. - Is He good? - Of course. Then if it's good for me He'll give it to me. How should I know? What's wrong with me getting married? - I don't know. - It's only good. Only good. There is nothing good in being alone and I'm sure of it and nothing's going to stop me. I just need to find the courage. It's the only thing I lack. I'm so nervous I'm gonna faint. You won't faint. MICHAL'S PETTING ZOO Okay, pick a number between one and five. - Two. - Two, very good. We're calling two matchmakers right now. Let's call Fried and Zeidman. - How about Fried and Klapholtz. - Okay. Forgive me. L don't forgive you. Wow, you have such a beautiful laugh. You have a beautiful laugh. Thank you. Michal... Will you marry me? Wow. I feel like I've found what I lost. What? You know nothing about me. What's there to know? You know, something simple like... what do I look like? We've been here for two hours and you haven't looked at me once. I have a whole lifetime to look at you. Only at you. Tell me more about this trick. If I never look at another woman, my wife becomes the most beautiful woman in the world. That's my gift to her. Ronen, listen. Let's make a deal. I'm listening. Since I just met someone crazier than me, which is a first for me... I'm with you. I promise that if you look at me, I will marry you. Are you serious? Totally. You're just saying that so I'll look. No, no. Not at all. No. - No way. - Oh yes. Oh, yes, and if you don't mind, we're getting married on the 8th night of Hanukkah. I have a feeling this is a test for me. No, that's not it. That's not it. That's not it. This is really cruel of you. No, what makes you say that? That's not it. I get it from your energy. My energy is following yours. You can't force me. You think I'm trying to force you to marry me? Maybe not force me, but you want me to look at you so you can mess with my head. Nobody's ever tried to make that deal before. You've proposed like this before? I always propose. What? You come across like a sane person. I believe that God will only let me marry the right one, so I tell all the girls they're amazing and the one who really wants me will say yes. No conditions, no driving me crazy... Thank you. Your words are very powerful... - I don't think it's working. - Yes, you're right. Maybe you should take out the snake? I'm afraid it'll scare them. Want to see the snake? Yes! Okay- Meet... Avi. Avi is a snake, a Hack combat. He isn't dangerous to humans at all, he actually helps farmers - by eating lizards and mice. - Ew! But I buy him chicken at the supermarket and only sometimes I give him a mouse or a lizard. Where do you get mice? - I just get them. - That's so gross. Girls, who's brave enough to pet Avi? No. I'm sure there's one girl here who's brave enough to pet Avi. - No. - You. - What's your name, brave girl? - Sarah. - Sarah. Will you pet Avi? - Yes. I'd actually rather she didn't. Why not? She wants to. - I'd just rather she didn't. - Why? Too disgusting. But that's why you asked me here. Let's let Sarah pet Avi. No, I don't think so. Do you know what that thing eats? It's gross! Thank you. I think they ended up enjoying it. - We enjoy being frightened. - Apparently. Can I ask you a personal question? Sure, why not? Doesn't it make it hard to find a match? A delicate woman with mice and snakes. Maybe I'm not so delicate. So my mate isn't looking for a delicate wife. All men want a delicate wife. Let me take this, okay? Hello, Mrs. Fried, how are you? Good, thank God. But, Mrs. Fried, we've already discussed that option. Okay, but how are we supposed to communicate? L realize this is strange. How are you handling it? I'm used to strange. What do you do for a living? Mrs. Fried was a bit vague about that. I have a mobile petting zoo. Wow, that's unusual. But I'm considering changing jobs. Why? Because I have... I had a snake that eats mice and someone suggested that it wasn't very appealing that I fed Avi mice, although I usually gave him chicken that I bought at the supermarket. Tell me the truth, do you want me to find that unappealing? Why, do you find it appealing? Very. Don't change jobs. Mrs. Fried told me he's... you're a psychologist. I treat deaf people. Amazing. Very quiet... Why did you agree to meet me now? I know you were offered a meeting with me a year ago and you refused to meet him... Me. Because I thought it was... too complicated. So why now? Should I tell the truth? Only the truth. Despair. What? What's wrong? Why do you act this way? Whatever you need, I'll give you. If can, gladly, with all my heart. What? - Truce, Mom. I'm tired. - Okay. Just stop this madness. Rabbi, perhaps you could explain it so she'll understand. Michal, did you understand what I said? Yes, I think so. The Rabbi's not sure it's the Jewish way and it's not the way of our community. What you're doing is called "counting on miracles." It's not a question of our community, even saints wouldn't expect such things. Who gave you the right? Do you really want an answer, Rabbi? - Yes. - Go on. I'm not demanding anything of God. I only demand from myself the courage to believe His plan. As a rabbi, you understand the nuance, right? And I'm not obsessed with getting married, but I want this drama to be over, and for this story to have a happy ending. My wedding plan is like a karate chop, if I focus 100%, I'll break through the wall. At 99% I'll break my hand. Just one thing. If you don't get married on Hanukkah, what'll happen to your faith? How much is this costing you? - Does it matter, Mom? - Is something wrong? Michali's getting married. Still with the marriage nonsense? Excuse me, Rabbi. - I'm calling Gidi. - Why? He should know what's going on and take some responsibility. - It has nothing to do with him. - Yes it does. It has nothing to do with Michal's madness. Sure it does. It's driving me nuts. Rabbi, Noam was my problem daughter, but Michali? If she weren't so religious, she'd be nearly perfect. This makes no sense. What is she even talking about? Michal. As soon as your flight lands - say a prayer for me and Sagi. - Okay, sis. Pray that he has a change of heart. Rabbi Nachman will be pleased that even my sister is getting religious. Not quite. Ladies and gentlemen we are beginning our final descent. We wish you a pleasant stay in Ukraine. UMAN, UKRAINE - Bye. - Where are you headed, Michal? - I am going now to the tomb. - Where are you staying? I don't plan to sleep. THIS WAY TO RABBI NACHMAN'S TOMB I'm a liar. A liar. I can't feel you. I don't feel anything. Where are you? Why did you create me this way? Everyone feels you. I don't feel you at all. I'm a liar. Hey... I'm a liar. Hey... Just give me a sign that you're okay. Who's there? The tomb is half on the men's side and half on the w omen's side. What? Who are you looking for'? - What? - Who are you looking for? Who's looking? It sounds like you're really missing someone. As if it's hard for you to let go. It's too much for me. I'm sorry. Aka)'- What's your name? I'm tired. Forgive me. I'm too tired. I'm leaving. Just go with the flow. The flow to where? Rabbi Nachman watches over us, honey. Hey, what's your name? I'm starving. What's your name? Michal. Bon appétit, Michal. Michal? You're Michal, right? It's been a long time since I heard someone call themselves a liar. Excuse me, are you Yoss or am I a total wacko? You aren't a wacko. But why are you a liar? I was really touched by what you said. - Really? - Yeah, it was like... - It had a kind of groove. - Define "groove." Define "groove"? I don't really know. I was too touched to analyze it. What touched you? You did. - Me? - You. You were honest. Honesty is the real deal. Yoss, do you know what you're doing? What am I doing? You're healing me. Wow. Totally wow. Let's go for a walk. I'm meeting my friends at the car in 5 minutes. - What are you doing in Ukraine? - We had a gig in Kiev and Yoni decided that we have to visit the famous Rabbi Nachman. - Coming? - I don't know. Pretend we're at your house and you're walking me to my car. Hm? All right. Let's go. So what made you so unwell? I'm healed. Don't you remember? - If only it worked that way. - If what did? A few words and the soul is healed. It does work that way. Where do you live? - Jerusalem. - Address? - Why? - What's your address? 4 Arnon St. Why? So you don't disappear on me. I won't disappear. Okay- Want to hear a secret? Sure do. 12 days from now, the 8th night of Hanukkah, I'm getting married. With the man of my dreams whom I have yet to meet. Are you on something? - What do you mean? - Are you high? - You mean if I'm on drugs? - You sound like it. I don't know about being a druggie. "Druggie"? Not really, no. Good for you. You're getting married but you have no groom? It's much simpler than you think. I just believe, sweetly and gently, that in the next 12 days I'm going to... meet...the love of my life, my best friend, my husband and the father of my children. And if you don't meet him? But I will and there will be a wedding. You're really... Will there be guests? Or aren't you inviting anyone? Of course I am. I've invited 200 people. You're invited, too, by the way. Imagine how our kids will react when we will tell them. Did you think I meant "our" kids? - Didn't you? - No, no. Not at all. Sorry. I meant me and my husband's kids when they hear that our friend the pop star was at the wedding. That's all. You got scared. Yeah. Is it that scary to marry me? No. NO, fight? - Your friends. - My friends. Will you marry anyone who's willing? No, this isn't like hunting season. But finding the love of your life 12 days before Hanukkah, is no more a miracle than finding him at all. It's not about who will be "willing," it's about the one man who wants this like I do and he'll be mine and he'll be the one for me. Michal, you're a real surprise. I wish you well, Yoss. And I wish you well, too. Take care. Take care, Michal. I listen to him all the time, I have his CD. I have ALL his CDs. - I know, it's unreal. - So how did it end? My heart broke, that's how. Can you believe it? Look, you've had a crazy experience. You're not thinking straight. No, you don't get it, it was... it was brief, but it was so honest and so intense, whoa! - Don't lose your head. - No. God will watch out for me. Try this song instead. It's a little long. Hello, Mrs. Klapholtz. - Michal? - Yes. Where've you been? I've been looking for you. I was out of the country for a night. - I just got back. - Fine, you went away but I'm still here working hard for you. Not because I feel guilty about Gidi, but! want to find someone soon. I'm sorry. No need to apologize. It's actually for the best. Anyway, I have a great guy for you. You listening? - Yes. - His name is Assaf Stern, he's 35, religious for three years, road engineer, studies, works, a Breslov Hasid like you wanted, studies with Rabbi Schechter. He's a real catch. When can you meet him? Today. It's short notice, but I'll try. - I'll get back to you. - Great, thanks. You said I could pay half now and the rest after the wedding. I have great respect for you, please don't ruin that. You don't believe this is happening. No. Well that's a shock. Why? I was sure you'd be understanding. What are you trying to prove, Michal? Shimi, don't upset me right now. Gidi. Ziv told me you're here. What are you doing here? What am I doing here, Michal? - Tell me. - You tell me. No, I want to hear it from you. I can't. Yes, you can. Tell me. Please tell me. I'll tell Shimi and he'll tell you. Tell her. No, don't tell. Tell her. No, no, don't tell me. Tell her. - Shimi, don't tell me. - Tell her. - No, don't tell me. - Tell her. No! Sorry. How long after the wedding can I start entertaining? - Listen, there's a problem. - What's up? Sit down a second. - You're worrying me. - You have to sit down, okay? Speak LIP- Gidi and Ziva are getting married. Who's Ziva? - Speak up. - Gidi the jerk and Ziva the doctor. As in Ziv my roommate? It began when she called to convince him to take you back. Is this some kind of joke? I'm dead serious. It's only been two weeks. Come in. My poor sweetheart. How long have you known? We just found out. What I wouldn't do to that witch- Enough, Mom. - To both of them. - Where is she? What do you need, Michal? ZN'? Ziv! Ziv, open the door. Open the door, you can't run away. - Ziv, open up! - Calm down first. You calm down! Shame on you! I'm not coming out. Oh yes, you are! Either way, lady, - you're opening this door! - Stop it, Michali. Why? I just want to talk! - It doesn't seem that way. - I'm not coming out. Open up, I'm gonna lose it. - You hear me? - Michal, you're out of line. I'm out of line?! Shame on you! You, of all people?! Ziv, I want to talk! Whoa! L don't know why it broke. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Go away. Not now. - Just take her away. - No way. You don't get to be the star of this show, do you hear me? - You have no right. - Michal, relax. Stop it! Stop. So, Assaf, what are you looking for in a woman? The complete opposite of you. - Pardon me? - Someone just like you. - I don't get it. - How am I supposed to answer? Good answer. Where did you drift off to? As if you care. I don't care. - Thank you. - For what? For being honest. It's thanks to you. - What do you mean? - You have this nutty energy. - Nutty? - Nutty, Why did you just go pale? Are you some kind of actor? You recognize me. - I didn't mean a real actor... - Took you a while. Was I supposed to recognize you? - I'm a star. - A star? I thought you recognized me. No. What's going on here? Not even my mom thinks I'm a star. Then what are you? An observant Jew. God's servant. Simple as that? Simple as that. So why did you go pale? I can't believe you're asking that again. Then why don't you answer'? - Why am I pale? - Yes. - Let me think about it. - Take your time. I think I'm pale because... My ship sank. And because I'm all alone now out at sea. I'm out of breath, I'm tired, I'm exhausted. I'll survive. What about you, Assaf? Why are you so pale? I'm not. We're all pale. Tell me, what's your paleness? Don't want to be alone out there, huh? No. - Sorry. - No, it's not fair. - It's all right. - No it isn't. - You'll live. - Not necessarily. There's no time. That's what I'm saying, there's no time. It's true, I'm alone out at sea, clinging to a board or whatever, then I look to the right and see... Assaf, you're here too. Just like me, adrift at sea and I don't have the strength to swim, but you do. Then you say to me, "Michali, follow me." And I swim behind you and I find the strength. We swim and swim and we reach a beautiful island and it's deserted. - And no one can rescue us. - How do you know? Because I'm the one telling this story. We reach the island and we're alone, not a living soul, and we can't leave. You and I on a desert island forever. Do we get along? "Getting along" isn't enough. I think if we were together on a desert island we'd become the best of friends. That's what I call true love, and you'd become the most important thing in my life. What do you want? To brush my teeth. It can wait. It's okay, come in. You look nice. That's what it's like when you're a bride. It's a special kind of beauty. You have a visitor, girlfriend. - Who? - You won't believe it. Hello. Hello, hello. What are you doing here? Two sugars, please. Sorry. Want some coffee? - Tea? - No. Nothing. Just making sure you weren't gonna kick me out. I can't believe you're here. What's with the Biblical Zoo? It's my job. I have a mobile petting zoo. You're not for real. You won't believe this, but no man ever sat in this room. What do you mean? No... male has ever been in this room. Wow. Suits me. I need some water. Can I get you a glass of water? Sure. Hello, is Feigi home? You have no idea what a distraction you are. Thanks. - Distraction? - Totally. - I'm offended. - I could never offend you. I'd play along with you since this is so surreal, but I'm untethered now. I'm at war. I don't even have time to think. Sit down. So what about when we met in Ukraine? Let's please forget about that. Why should I? Let's focus on the present and admit this isn't realistic. It isn't realistic? L know this is a surprise and I feel like some stupid kid right now but... I want you. Listen, my head is spinning. I don't understand what you're saying. I'm saying I'm ready now and I believe in you and me. What are you saying to me? Let's get married. I have to put a stop to this. L-I don't get it. Are you trying to mess with my mind? I'm taking you seriously. I have no choice. - It's okay, relax, Michal. - How? How can I relax? It's easy for you to come here with that... face of yours and throw lines at me and I, like some idiot... buy it. It's humiliating, so please stop it, okay? I'm looking for something real and simple. You want thrills. But I'm playing by your rules and I don't want you to marry anyone else. I'm out on a limb here... Stop it. This is cruel. - Cruel? - Yes, very cruel. It's a game to you, but this is crucial for me. You're trying to win over the religious chick or whatever your trip is, and if it doesn't work we can just end it, but I'm sorry, I can't. I'm looking for the real deal. I see. You see what? I don't know. It's interesting. What is? I'm over games, but you're the player here, Michal. I'm right. And you're too far into it to stop. It was wishful thinking that I'd find my true love here. - Hey. - Hi. What... - Aren't you at the tasting? - I was. Am I disturbing you? No, not at all. So how's our food? - Good, huh? - Very good. Yes. - Sure I'm not disturbing you? - No, not at all. Not at all. Everything okay? - Everything... - Mostly okay? Listen, I want to make a little change to the invitation. Maybe it'll help me connect. All right. Come sit down. I may be panicking, I hope that's okay. It doesn't show... I could faint any second now. You're funny. What... Can you add a decoration to the groom's side to balance it out? What? "Mystery Groom"? I'm doing my best here. Shimi, do you live here? - Is that a trick question? - No, I just want to know. I work here, so... There are late weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, so sometimes I sleep here. How many times this week? Are you from the authorities or something? L Pay my taxes. What does your wife have to say about it? My wife... Doesn't say much. Lately we haven't... Said much of anything. - Telephone. - Right. Hello, Mrs. Klapholtz. How are you? Fine, thank God. Okay. Sure, I understand. But what do you mean I "freaked him out"? Fine, fine. Do you have someone else for me? Thanks anyway. All the best. I wish you well. Would you marry anyone who proposed? Why would you say that? - Did you even like that guy? - What guy? The one she set you up with? I liked him very much. Assaf is... the salt of the Earth. So why are you giving up so easily? He's not into it. What can I do? Hold on. What about your heart? Shimi, I don't stop for a second. You think I have time to deal with my heart? - Then what are you dealing with? - God. Oh. - Good for you. A real saint. - No. Don't exaggerate. I'm serious. You're in a league of your own. What are you saying? That when you're not around I believe your Hanukkah miracle could really happen. And when I'm around? I wonder what you could be thinking. Shimi, do me a favor, assume that my Hanukkah miracle will happen and don't plan to see me until my wedding day, okay? - Okay. - Thank you. Michal. It's great you can relax in your new apartment. Can't take that for granted. Can you get me some water, sis? Thanks. You said you had an event at six. It's already five. Yes, the animals are already in the car. Thanks. The washing machine guy said he'd be here by seven, so I hope they won't be late. Okay- How are you? Good. . Very . Yes? Hello? Hi. How's it going? Can I call you back in a few minutes? Sure. Bye. Excuse me, who was that? Who else? Sagi? - It couldn't be anyone else. - No way. Unbelievable. How did that suddenly happen? It's not suddenly, it's a whole life, Michal. It's commitment, responsibility. How come you...the most unbalanced person I know, always know how things will work out? You know, too. I've never known less. You do know, but your head is in the clouds. You need to come back to reality. Decide what is true and what is false. I say, truth is what works for you. Anything else isn't real. He's amazing! a' Come to me, Mama, come to me I Yoss! Yoss! - Yoss, can I get a picture? - Sure. - Can I get a picture, Yoss? - Sure. Great. - You were awesome. - Thanks. Can I please have your autograph? Thanks. Will you please marry me? Get in line, girl. How are you? Okay- - I don't know. - No? - I don't know. - You don't know. And you? Everything's light. - Light? - Yeah. What do you want, Michal? I feel like... everything I say comes out wrong. That's true. The words aren't working for you. Then tell me what to do. What am I supposed to do now? Michali. You are full of light. You don't have to do anything. Listen to me. In two days you'll be married. - How do you know? - I just do. You play to win. Yeah. Yoss! That was the straw that broke the camel's back. Not necessarily. How's about we go to the beach? Okay, let's go. How are you? Good. You are getting married in two days. Mot Feigi, daughter oi Eliika, tell me the truth and nothing but the truth. Do you believe it will happen? - Just a little? - I'm counting on it. It's the salt of the Earth guy I met last week. So answer. I have a good feeling about this. Michal? Yes? What's up? Sorry I'm calling so late. Is it okay? It's fine, great. How are you? Good. Very good. Glad to hear it. How are you? Is it okay that I'm calling you? It's great. I know it's late, I just want you to know that you're hotheaded and super uptight, but I can't get you out of my mind. okay- I think we should meet again. Michal? Where are you tonight? I'm on army reserves duty. When do you come home? In a week. - Michal? - Yeah, I'm here. Are you okay? I'm getting married in two days. What? When did that happen? With whom? I don't have a groom... But besides that, it's a done deal. Are you joking? No, and I want to apologize for being so uptight on our date. L can't tell if you're joking. 7 p.m., 8th night of Hanukkah, the King David Hall. Assaf, you're more than welcome to come. Wow, I'll have to wrap my head around this. Good night. Kosher. MICHAL'S GETTING MARRIED Kosher. You've immersed properly and you're pure. She's so lovely, so beautiful. Congratulations. Are you the mother'? What a lovely daughter you have. It's so exciting. What an honor. Congratulations. Shosh, with respect, please stop it. We have to keep her spirits up. We need to be there for Michal. You're right, but how I feel is no joke, either. What do you feel, Mom? Humiliated. You can't imagine how embarrassed I am. I'm sorry. I know. Will she freak if she sees me? - If she won't I will. - Bad idea. Maybe Michal wants to reconcile. Don't go. Okay? Sta}!- My darling. My sweetheart. Thank you. You're the icing on the cake. No way.. No way are you "not" getting married tomorrow. I'm certain of it. I know it. Know it. Michali? What time is it? 7:30. Are you coming? - Coming where? - To Michal's wedding. Of course. Of course I'm coming. This is it. Say it. Anything can happen. Everything is possible. a' Now the heavens are opening up for us... I Michali, we're here. Wake up, honey. Let's go. I'll go park. My darling, my darling. Come, darling. Good luck. Mind if I go out for some fresh air? Go ahead. I'll go with Mom, okay? We're all rooting for you here, honey. - This bubble is about to burst. - No. You must believe. HEY- How are you? I don't know... I'm feeling overwhelmed, Shimi. I understand. Want something to drink? I'm fasting. You really got everyone's attention here. You think that's what I'm doing? Big time. How come there's no groom here? Thanks, Shimi. I was sure... I don't know, that someone would be here. I'm glad you've been paying such close attention, - but... - Marry me. Now, you and me, like in the movies. - What? - Let's just do it. Put an end to this. What are you saying? The suspense is killing me. Seriously. Hold on, Shimi. I don't follow you. I'm fasting and I'm dizzy. You're already married, aren't you? Honey, why don't we tell the band to play something? What do you say? This silence is deafening. - Whatever you want, Mom. - Something upbeat, right, honey? - What? - I'll go tell them. How are you? - What? - Forget I asked. Feigi, I'm weak. God help me. Who were you talking to? Listen to me, I'm on the brink. I think I'm starting to hallucinate. I'm not sure my heart can take this. - Tell me what you want. - Reassurance, Feigi. May r;? Can you come with me for a moment? You're married, aren't you? Not as of one week ago. We've been separated for a year and suddenly she agreed to a divorce. Weird, huh? Can you come with me? I tried to get up before and I got dizzy. I'm so weak. It's time for a wedding now. Look at the chuppah. Just look. Let's fill that chuppah with people tonight. Shimi, what do you think all this is? What do you mean, "all this"? Some kind of circus? I want the real deal. I don't want to tick off "wedding" and then get a divorce. - Why a divorce? - That's what you're saying. I didn't say divorce. - No? - Never. You're being silly because you just got divorced. You don't understand, we didn't stand a chance... Say it clearly, I'm fasting, I'm dizzy and I can't follow what you're saying. She didn't want me. She didn't want children, she didn't want God, she didn't want anything. What do you want from me? To come with me. - Where to? - To the chuppah. I'm telling you. - Why? - Because! - That's not enough. - Sure it is. - I don't buy it. - Sure you do. You are not communicating. - You're not listening. - To what? I want to marry you. Tonight, here. For real. Cut it out. This wedding plan of yours is like a crazy beautiful start-up venture. - I have to sit down. - You are sitting down. Relax. I'm totally out of it. It's just the adrenaline. Look at me. Look at me. Well? What do you say? You're one hell of a man. Really. And your heart is... amazing, but you're doing this out of pity. What? I'm not saying it's not charming, but that's not the point. Michali, you think I pity you? You pity me. Absolutely. Remember the first time we met? When I came to book the hall, about 1,000 years ago. No, we first met at my mom's. You sat there reading "Psalms" and I said to myself, "No way does she need my mom to get married." This is totally crazy. It's so crazy. You know why? All month I've been thinking, "If no man "comes to walk you down the aisle... I will." Michal... imagine how amazing it'll be if you marry me now. Are you with me? Who's your closest friend? Feigi. Imagine saying to Feigi, "Let's go, we're starting." Imagine her face. Two minutes ago nothing was happening and suddenly... here it is. Imagine... That I promise to care for you. That I'm committed my love only to you... And respect you... and cherish you. What do you say, Michali? Will you go for it? You smell so good. You're really... I'm going to talk to the Rabbi. Well? Feigi, get the oil lamps. I'm getting married. This is too much. Shosh, please tell me, where are the oil lamps? - What oil lamps? - The candles. Mom, the groom is coming to cover my face now. - Stop it, baby. - You can't fool me. Feigi, he's coming. I'll end up having a stroke. Shosh, let's go look for the lamps. Give me an update. Shimi is the groom. Who's Shimi? The owner of the hall. Remember the lady with the fish I told you about? He's her son. How can I help? Take off my earrings. Okay, it's all taken care of. Tell me you're okay. This must be what drugs are like, Feigi, but way better. But pray for me that I'll never take this feeling for granted, okay? Neither of us will. What is this, Michali? The end of the world as we know it, Mom.
