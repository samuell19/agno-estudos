[upbeat music] Hi. My name's TJ. I'm 12 years old, I'm British, and I'm from West London. I'm all right, actually. And I've never been in trouble in my whole life. But today, June the 13th, for no reason at all, it's all about to change. [PA] We've got many special offers today, June 13th, on all barbecue food items. Many items are half-price. Many are buy one get one free... [announcement continues indistinctly] ["So In Love" playing] ♪ You are the one who gives me joy ♪ ♪ You're the one who makes me smile ♪ ♪ You are the one who fills my void ♪ ♪ Every day and night ♪ ♪ You are the one who gives me hope... ♪ [girl] Hey, TJ. Hey, Tanya, you all right? What you doing here? Shopping. I'm surprised to find you here. What are you doing? -I just came to check out the laptops. -Dreamer! Have you done the maths homework? It's kinda hard. [TJ] Not yet. But it ain't due until Friday, is it? [Tanya] No, but I'd rather do it now than later. [TJ] True, true. -Did you watch football in the week? -[Tanya] Yeah, it was kinda boring... [TJ] This is Tanya Richards. Tanya's the prettiest girl in my class. [chuckles] My God! She looks so pretty. [indistinct conversation] I think she likes me. Well, I'm not too sure. We'll see. [Tanya] Yeah, so our history and geography teacher, Mum thinks that she's erm, a bit strange. -[TJ] She doesn't like girls. -No, and we get told off for gossiping. You all right? [TJ] Oh, no! Rodney Marsh! Yeah, I'm fine. What do I do? Oh, no. Trouble. You're not scared of him, are ya? [scoffs] Me, scared? -Nah. -I didn't think so. Just carry on walking. Stay calm. Stay calm. [sighs] Rodney Marsh, can you get out of our way, please? Why don't you get your African boy and make me? Hey, Dumbo! Can you speak? English! [laughs] African boy can't speak English. TJ, I ain't got time for this. Come on, let's go! [Rodney laughs] What's so funny? Your African boy, he's scared out of his wits. Look at his face. [mimicking monkey] [laughs] What are you doing? -Stupid! -Tijan, I ain't got time for this. Come, on, let's go. Oh, Tanya! Please, please, save me! What are you gonna do, African boy? [Tanya] TJ, come on! Hey rod-head! My name is not African Boy! Who're you calling rod-head, African Boy? African bo-bo! TJ! Are you all right? Look what you've done to him! That's for calling me rod-head. No! TJ! TJ, stop! -Please! -What's my name? -Tijan! -What's my name? -Tijan! -Say my name! -Tijan! -Louder! -Tijan! -What's my name? -Tijan! -That's right! -[Rodney groans] -[Tanya] Come on! [TJ sucks teeth] I'm not even African. [knocking at door] Yes? Can I help you? Are you TJ's mum? Yes, I am TJ's mum. Why? Hello, madam. My name is PC Andrews. This is WPC Olu from Blackfield Police Station. We are here in connection with a complaint lodged by Mrs. Marsh regarding an incident involving your son, TJ. -Can we come in, please? -Where is he? Where is the little bully? -Take it easy, Mrs. Marsh. Calm down. -Relax, sweetheart. Who are you? Sorry, madam. This is Mrs. Marsh. And this is her son, Rodney. May we come in? Look at him! Look what your little tramp did to my son! -Tijan did that to you? -Yes, he did that to him. We let you lot into our country, and all you can do is pick on-- That's enough, Mrs. Marsh. Sorry, erm, may we come in, please? As long as you can get her under control. That way. [TJ] Ooh! I am in deep doo-doo. So, how did this happen? About half hour ago, I come back from the pub, and what do I see? Rodney looking like a bloody punch bag! Madam, is your son home? We'd like to ask him a few questions. Look at him! This is GB-bloody-H, this is! -Why don't he pick on someone his own age? -Tijan! [Mrs. Marsh] Where is he? I ain't got all day. I'm getting him suspended, I am. Who's this? That's TJ. [Mrs. Marsh] What? That's my son. TJ, did you do this to this young man? [TJ] Yes! And I enjoyed every minute of it! Is this him? Is this the boy that did this to ya? That little thing there beat you up? Rodney Marsh, you are a bloody waste of space, you are! Just like your bloody father! D'you know what? I'm going home. [Mrs. Marsh] Why you doing still standing there? Get your arse out this door before I give you a bloody good hiding myself! Come on, move it! And as for you, you little tosser, you aren't heard the last of this, mark my words! For God's sake, Rodney! What are you playing at, being beaten up by a little tyke like that? [Mrs. Marsh's voice fades] He called me monkey and stuff. He hit me first. Shut up, TJ. Young man, in the circumstances, I could be arresting you and putting you in a police cell, so I'd watch your tongue, if I was you. -Is his father around? -No. I mean, what has it got to do with this? I'm a single mum, all right? His father is back home. In Gambia. No Problem, madam. Erm... I suppose what we do is take some details, and we wait and see what Mrs. Marsh intends doing. -May we? -Yeah. Definitely. [excited chatter] Please settle down, guys! Put that away, now! -Settle down! -Settle down, guys! Right! Quiet! Quiet, please! Thank you. Thank you. Right, OK, so... Tijan. Come to the front of the class, please. -[boy] Tyson! -[children shout] [TJ] Tyson. That's what they started to call me after the fight with Rodney. -I like the sound of that. -[teacher] OK. Now, class, I want you to listen because Tijan here is a star pupil and a very popular young man. However, I've got some sad news to announce, because our dear Tijan will unfortunately be leaving us soon. -[girl] Yeah! -[chatter] Excuse me? Excuse me? Well, very soon, actually. Tijan is going to live in Africa. -[laughter] -[TJ] What? [teacher] Excuse me? -It's not funny! -It is. He's going to live in the Gambia, because his mother... has got a new job out there. Well, we're all gonna miss you very much, Tijan. Would you like to say anything to the class? No? -OK. Well, I understand. -[sighs] But well, cheer up! I mean, it's really exciting. It's a new adventure, eh? [TJ] You're joking, right? OK, well, we're all going to wish him the very best of luck in the Gambia. -So, come on, good luck, Tijan! -[boy 1] Go on, TJ! -[clapping] -[boy 2] Go on, TJ! -[cheering] -OK. Right, class, come on! Get your books out, quick as you can... [indistinct chatter] [TJ] What the hell am I gonna do out in Africa? I don't even know anyone there. [child shouts] Tell me it's not true. I don't know, Tanya. My mum didn't tell me nothing. For real. She didn't tell me nothing. She's been acting strange since I had the fight with Rodney. Mrs. Nugent said you're staying there. Nah, I ain't staying nowhere. My parents might be Gambian but I'm British. [sighs] I've had enough of this. [sucks teeth] Does your dad know you're coming over there, then? My dad? He doesn't even know I exist. [sighs] I'll... I'll run away or something. I ain't even joking! Don't do that. Just talk to your mum or something. My mum? My mum won't listen. She's just angry. She's always angry! I've got to go now, but I'll see you later, then, yeah? Yeah. [TJ] That was it. One fight on the 13th of June has changed my life forever. Nobody, just me. This is ridiculous... [TJ sucks teeth, sighs] It's like I'm really on a plane to Gambia. Somebody wake me up. Are you all right? Of course I'm not all right! This is unreal. [sighs] You would love it in Gambia. I don't know what you're worried about. You are African, and you should be proud of it. [frustrated groan] I hate her! I was born here. I'm British, not Gambian. The more reason you need to go home. To discover who you really are. You might carry a British passport, but your blood is Gambian, so get used to it. Mum say Dad lives in Gambia. I've never met him but she gets angry every time I mention his name. Will I get to see my dad? You already know the answer to that. So, don't ask me stupid questions. This is mad! [music plays through headphones] Welcome to the rest of my life. ["Road to Victory" playing] Welcome! Hello! How are you? -Hello! -[camera clicks] Welcome to the Gambia! [indistinct chatter] [chatter] OK, mate! All right. You can go of me now. I'm not a baby. All right? Let go of me! -Whoa! -[women groan] -What was that? -[woman] Already? -Tijan, where are you? -I'm here, Mum. What happened? Erm, blackout, darling. Welcome to Africa. Oh, my God! I am gonna love this country. [upbeat pop music] Look at her, pretending to be rich. Back in London, she always complained when I asked her for lunch money. This place is really depressing. What am I doing here? [chatter] [gasps in pain] [hip-hop plays through headphones] [cackling] [claps hands] [sighs] [sucks teeth] These mosquitoes are freaking me out, man! I'm not even joking. [cackling] [indistinct chatter] [door creaks] [water drips] [clattering] [woman 1] Help me! He has hurt himself! [woman 2] What happened? There's this boy I saw here, in the room, but then he disappeared. -Disappeared? Where? -Is there somebody else in this house? -[women] No! -I saw the boy at the mirror! You saw the boy in the mirror? Yes, in the mirror! He smiled at me and walked this way! -Tijan, please don't start. -Why don't you ever believe me? Because you are seeking attention again, -and it's pissing me off! -[woman] Maybe he's scared. I'm not scared. I know what I saw, OK? [groans] See what I mean? I'm not standing here to listen to this. We leave first thing in the morning. [woman 1] Don't worry. Let's just go inside. [woman 2] Someone clean up this mess! [woman] Sit down. I'm coming, all right? [TJ] Good night to you too, Mum! ["Road to Victory" playing] [TJ] It's him! The boy from last night! [indistinct chatter] God, don't let this happen to me! Don't let me get lost in this place! TJ? My son, my little boy... My... My boy, TJ. He's, erm... He's... -[man] Don't leave your bag. -No, I need a police station. -I can't find him. -We've got a police station there. -Where? Where? Wh-Where? -[indistinct] [TJ] Who are you? Who are you and what do you want from me? Why do you keep following me for? What do you want from me? Was that you at the house the other night? What? Who are you? Is this a game? Some stupid joke? Look, I need to find my mum. Wait a minute. That girl couldn't see you, could she? It was like you're invisible or something, and I'm the only one that can see you? What did you do that for? You're some crazy kid! Leave me alone. I need to find my mum. You're not real. You're just in my head. Leave me alone! Journey? What journey? Look, I'm not going anywhere with you! You need to seriously get lost and leave me well alone! If you ain't gonna help, I'll find someone else! [indistinct] From London? Erm, Sergeant, please, I just need to find my son. Look, I will do anything, OK? This is a photograph of him. [sergeant] Fine boy. Madam, we need to start immediately. -You have a car? -Erm... You see, the police van, there is no petrol. I don't have a car but I will buy the petrol. -Please, let's just go. -Constable? -[both] Yes, sir! -If SO comes in, tell him I'm on emergency. Come! Keep this bag for madam. Make sure you keep it very safe. I don't want to hear any stories. Madam, let's go! We have to begin from the market, where everything started. [dramatic music] Come. [engine fails to start] Start now, start now! [engine fails to start] Madam, I'm sorry. I'll have to get the boys to push this car. [TJ] Where exactly are we going? I have to ask questions. Every time I keep asking, you keep giving me all these riddles. I'm tired of the riddles. I'm scared of this place and the animals. What should I worry about? On what? And if we're on the wrong track? Wow! [TJ] What is it? [bird caws] [laughs] [groans] [laughs] Help! [TJ] Help me. Help! Help! Please! What are they gonna do with us? You're finding this funny? You said that you were sent for me. Oh, shit! My hands! Think faster before these men have me for dinner. -Help! Help! Please! -I said shut up. Shut up. [sergeant] Don't worry. We'll find the boy. They have stopped doing those rituals in this town. But if it were before, say five years ago, I would have said let's forget it. -What do you mean by rituals? -You don't know? These men, they use human parts for protection and for more money. Hey! This country! But they have stopped doing it now. That is why I say we will see him when the market people have all gone home and the place becomes clear. -What time does the market close? -About six o'clock. Don't worry. This is my case. I have studied it. I will find him for you. [drum beating] [in dialect] Here comes our beautiful queen! [drum beating, clapping] My arms and legs are killing me. When are you gonna to come up with some ideas? [excited shouting] What are gonna do with me? And what does that mean in plain English? What? Kill me? Do something! Cut me down! For God's sake, cut out the he-goat riddles. Just get me out of here! How can I say that? [in dialect] I will wrestle your champion! I will wrestle your champion! [laughter] [TJ] What have I said? Why are they laughing? [clapping] What should I do now? What? Him? He'll kill me. I can't fight. Fighting got me in this place in the first place. [TJ] You want to fight me? Come on then! Come on! Show me what you've got! [cheering] Come on! [cheering] What did I do? [TJ] You told me to fight! This is Tijan Jacobs. He's missing since morning. The last time we see him, he was wearing jeans, white shirt and canvas. Aishatou Toure, Kids With Talent radio. Where was the last place he was seen? Outside Serekunda Market. Police is trying to find the boy, so that he can join his mother. Teema Jallo, Observer newspaper. Officer, what are you saying to the public out there about this boy, Tijan? If anybody sees or knows anything, please go to the Serekunda Police Station and ask for me, Sgt. Ceesay. There is 200,000 dalasi for any person who will help us find the boy. Nancy Njie, Today newspaper. Madam, what can you tell us about this boy? [Teema clears throat on TV] My son, Tijan, is very nice little boy. He will not hurt anybody. So, if you know anything, or if you've seen him, please contact the police. And, erm... Tijan, baby, if you can see this, I need you to go to the nearest police station immediately. OK? I miss you. I miss you so much... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [sobbing] How do you know that? Yeah, right. [chuckles] So, why do you talk like you're 100 years old or something? You're just a boy. You're probably not even as tall as me. You're not even as old as me. [scoffs] Yeah, whatever! So, don't your parents worry about you? Really? When? I said your parents, not your grandparents. How can your parents die before you were even born? What kind of stupidness is that? You serious? So, how old are you? I mean really. More philosophy. I give up. What are you talking about? Look who's talking! I do wanna go and stuff but you're no better. You're like a stray dog. No offense but you're the wandering spirit, not me. Exactly, I don't know anything about you. I don't even know your name. You could even be... a ghost, for all I know. All right, then. If you're so smart with your African philosophy and stuff, where was I-- How... How did you know? Who told you? Can you tell the future? No, really. Can you tell what's going to happen next? What, you know about Tanya too? What the hell is this stuff? Wine? My mum will kill me if she knew. OK, OK. There, there. Nice one! I can't believe you know Tanya, you know? She's nice, isn't she? But you're spooky. [scoffs] Me? Afraid? I'm fearless African Boy! What about the fire? Hello, Sergeant. Hm? -Wrong number. -[phone beeps] [rooster crowing] Yeah, but I'm getting tired of all of this. Do you know what? I'm going home. Stay away from me, OK? I'll find my own way home. [Mirror Boy] Come back! Look, I don't know you, and I don't need you. I followed you since yesterday and look where it's landed me! Tijan! Tijan! It's the last thing on my mind right now! Mike, I can't talk about that now. My son is missing! You... You're not listening to me! You know, I have to go. We'll talk about this when I get back. All right? [indistinct chatter] -I'll wait for your call. -[woman] Thank you. OK. -Sergeant? -Madam. Please, sit down. We have not heard anything yet. I think it's a little too early. By the time the market women come in... we will know something. Don't worry. You know what? Go back to your hotel and rest. If I hear anything, I will just call on your mobile. Rest? You actually expect me to rest? Sergeant, my son is missing! Has been missing for 24 hours. There is no rest for me until I find him, do you understand? I'm sorry. [sighs] If I don't find him by 12, then... I'll have to alert his father. His father? Where is he? In London? Makasutu. Makasutu? That's not far away from here. It will be OK. We will find him. [coughing] Oh, Leema! Strange. [TJ gasping] [Leema] Where are you coming from? Boy! Let's go! [indistinct chatter] [man chanting] [all chanting] [TJ] This man's not happy to see me. Is anyone ever friendly in this place? This is it. I might as well leave right now. My friend, welcome! Welcome! [chuckles] Papa! Welcome, my friend! Papa wants you to take your shirt off. Relax. What's changed? No, thank you. The chair's enough. -I thought he didn't like me. -Papa is strange. No, thank you. Tell him, if he wants to help me, to take me to the big city by the sea. My mum will be waiting for me there. [speaks in dialect] A-ha! Hungry? Food? [indistinct] Ah! [TJ] Help! Help! Somebody help me! Help! Anybody! Help! Help! -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. I have information, information about the lost boy. Know how many people have been here today saying they have information about this boy? This is the truth, Officer. OK, what information do you have? Ah! [chuckles] Officer, bring one million, talk. No one million, no talk. My friend, would you get out of this place now? [female officer] Out now! Or else I'll arrest you for wasting police time. -What is the matter here? -We have information about Tijan. What? Did you see him? -Yes. We know where he is. -You do? Are you his mother? Yes, I am. Where is he? Is he OK? Officer, you said on TV that anyone that sees this boy, that you'll give him plenty of money. Give me one million! Look, I have some money-- -No, no, no! -Tell me where he is! No, madam! No, madam! It's not like that. -My friend, where is the boy? -Will you give me a million? One million? Where did you get that from? It's 200,000 dalasi we promised. Yes, we will give it to you if you take us to find the boy. My friend, where is the boy? Where's the boy? He's in my village. -Where is your village? -Marakisa. -Ma... Wh-Where's that? -That's 30 kilometers from here. Thirty... How did he get that far? When did you see him? Is he OK? Yes, he is fine. My father kept him somewhere safe. [sergeant] Where did you find him? I saw him in the desert, so I took him home. Did you say the desert? My son? That's... that's not possible... Are you sure of what you are saying? What was he wearing? Dirty white shirt and jeans. My father made him take off his shirt because it was hot. -He has a mark on his chest. -Oh, God! That's my son! Let's go, let's go, let's go! -My friend! -Oga officer, bring money! [indistinct chatter] You? Where have you been? OK, but can you get me out of here? Assignment? What assignment? OK, point taken. But can we have this conversation once I'm out of here? [chuckles] OK! OK! Please, Mirror Boy! Please can you get me out of this hole? Please! Please, Mirror Boy! I don't have a choice, do I? [indistinct chatter] What is he looking for? Where is my son? [in dialect] Honestly, I swear by almighty Allah, I put him here! You mean you put the boy in this hole? You are crazy. -You put my son in a hole? -No, madam! No, madam! -Where is he? -Let's find the boy first. Then we can deal with him! Where is my son? Madam, please, don't kill my papa. That's his shirt. [sobs] What have you done with my son? He told me that a spirit, a little boy was taking him from the city and was taking him home. Spirit? Little boy? What's going on here? Where is he? Where did he go? Where did the spirit take him? He said something about where his umbilical cord was buried. Wait. His father always said he will bury his umbilical cord in his home village, and he did pick it up. immediately it fell out. -Where is your husband's village? -Makasutu. But Tijan has never been there. He doesn't even know the name of the place. -Are you sure? -[Leema] Yes. Let's go, madam. Let's dump him in the next police station. Please forgive me! Please forgive me! [sergeant] You never told me your husband was royalty. No, he's not my husband. We didn't get married. He did mention his father was a chief. Actually, the last I saw of him was days after Tijan was born, when he obviously came to collect the umbilical cord. And... I was told you were looking for Njanko. Yes, this woman wants to discuss with him. Please, make it quick. We are very busy today. Erm... where is he? I need to speak with him. [man] And who are you, my daughter? My name is Teema. I am the mother of Njanko's son. Mother of Njanko's son? Alkalo, did Njanko tell you anything of sons in London? He told me a lot of things, but never about a son. Are you sure we are talking about the same man here? Njanko, son of Njuga. Came to London to study medicine, ended up studying history. He left in 1995 because his father was ill. -[Alkalo] OK. That is enough. -No wait! Let me finish. He has a mark on his chest. So, where is the son, then? Is he still alive? Erm... yes, I hope so. He's alive. Thing is, he's kind of missing. He is alive but he is missing? What is this woman talking about? She came from London, and in Serekunda Market, the boy got lost. This is what I am investigating. Please, I just need to speak with Njanko. He needs to help me find my son. [Alkalo] Njanko cannot be reached now. When you see the boy, come back and we'll talk again. We've got work to do. Please, I just need five minutes with him. I-- No! You can't, stranger. Njanko is dead. He died last week and was buried this morning. He was our king, and his queen is distraught. So, you see, your little story is not helping us at all. Unless you can produce your son and prove that my nephew was his father, the palace guards will see you out. Njanko is dead? Don't pretend, woman! If you did not hear about his death, what are you doing bringing him back after all these years? Look, if you are here to play games, we do not have time for that. We are not amused. I... I didn't know he was dead. I didn't even know he was king. I was only taking Tijan to his aunt before all this madness started. Where is here, and what am I really doing here? So, where are you going now? Where are you returning to? I still don't know your name. I get the idea. No more riddles So, where do I go now? Where do I go to find my mum? Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. Pregnant? Evil woman? -Sorry. You've totally lost me now. -[sighs] You have to go now, don't you? I can sense it. I am sorry for all the bad things I said to you. I was kind of freaked out. [TJ] Hm. The weird one has a heart after all. -I need to speak to you, Your Majesty. -Go on, Samba. In private, Your Majesty. [clicks fingers] -He is here. -Who's here? Who else? Njanko's son. -Ah. -Everything is going to fall apart. -What do we do? -Calm down, Samba! Calm down, OK? Calm? After all we've gone through? Your throne is safe. You shall be the king, and I shall still be the queen. And our unborn child, what becomes of-- Be quiet! Be a man for once! Have you no liver? No heart? If I had a heart, I wouldn't have done what I did. Nonsense! Nonsense! Things don't just happen! People make them happen! This clan should be grateful to you, to us for changing their destiny! Where's this mere boy? Is he in the palace? He has not yet arrived. His mother came here, looking for him. The boy went missing on his way here. And his mother turned up, asking for Njanko to help look for her son. Make sure that woman doesn't leave this palace. But she's here with some policemen. How can I do that? Remember, Samba, if I go down, you are coming right down with me. [TJ reads] "It is with deep sense of loss that the people of Makasutu announce the death of His Royal Highness, King Njanko the Third, who died on the 13th of June." 13th of June. Madam, you have to come with us. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go and look for my son. I've caused enough trouble, and it's not my intention. The Queen wants to see you! You have to come with us. Let the police leave. No... What? Don't! Stop! -Tijan? -Mum! -Stop! My son! -Mum! Tijan! Oh! Help! Water, please! Let somebody bring water! Help me! Tijan, don't do this to me! Wake up! Wake up! -Water! -Don't stand there! Bring some water! [sergeant] Water, please. Tijan! Open your eyes! Don't do this to me! Open your eyes! Tijan, wake up! Wake up! Open your eyes! Open it! Are you OK? Oh, God. This is my son. -This is my son. -Bring them in. Thank you for helping us find our boy. [chuckles] The police is your friend. We have been working very hard on this investigation for two days without sleep. This is for your troubles. [chuckles] You need not pay me. I was only doing my job. Never mind, Officer. Take it as a sign of our gratitude for helping us find the boy. But you can go now. The boy and the mother are resting. Say hello to madam. -I'll do that. -Thank you. I don't know what I was thinking bringing you back here. [sighs] I promise, as soon as all of this is over, we're going back to London, OK? I really needed to come. But we were too late. I know. [sighs] Your father was a good man. And I'm sorry I denied you his love. -But... -But what? Why did you hate him so much? I didn't hate him. No, I loved him. Probably still do but... But then he denied you first. He didn't believe you were his son. Until you were born, that is, and then he saw that mark. I didn't think anything of it at the time. If he knew that I was his son, why didn't he ever come for me? I never let him see you again. He didn't have any of our addresses. But you know what? He always said you'll come home when the time was right. I guess he was right. You know I don't know how... how I thought I could live without you. I missed you so much. That's all right, Mum. I needed to come. A tree that won't bow to the wind is destroyed by a storm. What? Where did that come from? TJ, is that you in there? -[laughs] -It's me. I was led here for a reason. Er, led here by whom? Some things are better left unsaid. Oh, dear! What have they done with my son? OK, we are going to see a doctor as soon as we get back. -What happened to you? -I have to learn. A dog can't run faster than its tail, as the Mirror Boy would say. Who is the Mirror Boy? So, it is you that is causing all this trouble in my kingdom? We can't choose what hand fate deals us. [Queen] Shut up! You sound just like him. You think this is a joke? No, Your Highness, we mean no harm-- Who asked you to speak? Er... we're just about to leave. This has been a mix-up. Oh, sit back down! OK. Don't worry, Mum. We're all instruments in the hands of God. All right, you are not helping. [sighs] Oh, dear. What do we do now? We banish them! We send them away! That is what we will do! We cannot do that! The boy has the mark on his chest. And how are you sure that the mark is genuine? Quiet, Samba! I know the mark of Ham Ham when I see it. I wasn't born yesterday. [sighs] I know you are worried about your inheritance. No! No! No! Let me finish! You can still be king. A regent. Until-- I don't want to be a regent! I don't want to hold the throne on loan for a fatherless boy that's just crawled out of the forest! What are you going to do, then? Are you going to kill him, like you killed his father? I see things, Samba. I hear things! Although I never saw eye to eye with Njanko on most issues, yet I will not go as far as you've gone. -Maybe the Queen had you under her spell. -What? Spilling your own blood once may be forgiven, but let's stop it there, and right there! Otherwise, this little tragedy will spell disaster for the clan. I have said my all. [sniffs and sobs] -[Samba] Get them out! -[TJ] Uncle! -Don't call me that! Move them! -[Teema] Where are you taking us? -Wait, Uncle, there's no baby! -What? He said to tell you that she's not pregnant. That it's all part of her plan. How did you know this? Who told you? There is no baby, is there? Oh! What are you talking about? Tell me the truth, now! Keep your voice down! Remember, if I go down, you are coming right down with me. It was your hands that took out his life. I did not touch him. Oh, yes, you did! Get out! Let's go! Go? Where are you taking us? [TJ] Mum, don't argue. Let's go. I'll drive you to the city. Please, don't come back. Go back to London, or she will kill you! Let's go! But I need my handbag. I have my passport, our passports, in there. They're in the car. When we get to the city, you'll get them. Where are my shoes? We have left the palace now. You can sit up properly. Oh, my darling husband. What do you think you're doing? Just let them go. We've done enough. The game is over. We have unfinished business in that car, and you're telling me it's over! [Samba] Leave them alone. That boy is innocent. Your evil beauty means nothing to me, not anymore. Baby, I'm carrying your child! There's no child! I know that now! [Queen] Who told you? That little boy? And you believe him over me? You disappoint me! [mutters under her breath] [laughs] Oh! Are you weary from your travels? [Samba] Stay away from me! [Teema whimpers] Get off me! Get off me! Mum! Let my son go! -[screams] -Mum! Mum! I have to see Teema now! Now! [TJ] Get off me! [Queen] Oh, yeah! [TJ] Leave me alone! It's over! Over! Look at your ugly soul! It's... over! [Queen screams] [Teema] TJ? -TJ! Hey! -Mum! -Are you OK? -I'm fine. -Are you sure? -I'm fine. -Are you hurt? -No. No? -Are you OK? -I'm fine. When I did not hear your call, I knew something was not right. This is why I came. This has been a terrible tragedy. Let's take you home to safety. Come. Er, my bag, my passports. [indistinct conversation] I am only holding the throne until you turn 21, as the custom says. And a man with borrowed clothes dances with caution. That's your great-grandfather, Amata. He had one son, your father's father, Njuga. He was a 106 years old. -106? -Yes. And when he died, his grandson took over. And then, finally, your father, Njanko, took over. And there he lies. -I know this boy. -Yes. That was your father, Njanko, when he was about your age. He was very fond of that picture. [young Njanko] I never knew what to expect when I was sent to get you. I'm also happy that we ran this race together. No, Tijan, I can see it. It is not safe down there! Tijan! Many forces don't want you to fulfill your destiny! Don't play into their hands. Listen to me, Tijan! Tijan! [sobs] ["Road to Victory" playing]
