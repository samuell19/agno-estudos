That is a series wrap on our queen, Issa Rae. You guys, I am incredibly humbled and blessed. - I love you. - I love you too. This show has been a part of the revolution. The way you showcase our humanity and portray us with grace and accountability, the way you love your city, the way you love black people, in your city, is part of the revolution. The give and share credit where it is due is part of the revolution. The way you created and collaborated with the intention of our fucked up, incredible, and beautiful black full humanity, baked into the identity and heart of this show is part of the revolution. The way you look so damn good, even when you ashy, is part of the revolution. You recognize at all times that it's a collective effort. There are no heroes, we get us free. With this show you made big girls feel seen, you made dark-skinned women feel seen, you made toxic black men feel toxic... and understood. You made people realize things about their mental health. Together y'all shifted culture, there is no revolution without art. INSECURE: THE END After five successful seasons, Issa Rae decided to end her acclaimed comedy. The fifth and final season shot for 111 days during the pandemic. Final table read. I would've never thought six years ago, we'd all be here. Making a show, and not being able to see people that look like me, be able to do a show like that here, that now the groundwork for others, it's just really special. You don't get to be a part of those things a lot. Let's shoot this shit for another three months guys, season six. I came into this, not knowing anything about television and not feeling confident in my role. I had a web series and a mentor who's selfless and has put his ego aside time and time again, to make sure I could create the show I wanted, with the people I wanted. I'm coming out of this a different person, a better person. I hope you guys are too. Thank you to the love of my life, my brother. Start of Production: Season Five We are back at Stanford shooting the first episode of the final season at my Alma Mater, this is crazy. Stanford has never done this before and they let us shoot here. I got mad because I didn't want the characters to go to Stanford. Because of a mistake in season one, we established them as that. But then we went with it. So, I did not imagine we'd be back here shooting, but when we came up with the reunion, it made sense and felt meta perfect for this season. We're returning to the place where Issa and Molly became friends. Okay, here we go. It feels so good to be back. It's picking up from last season, post Issa, Molly fight with them, on their road to reconciliation. Things are still awkward, but you can tell they both want to be back in that good place. At Stanford, I was into theater because I had been in plays in high school. Then I got into film, because of Love & Basketball, specifically. I wasn't thinking about TV because TV wasn't that popping. There wasn't enough representation and it didn't made me feel like, "I want to make what they're making." I love The Office, Curb and Seinfeld. That's what influenced me to write television later on, but I never thought about starring in my own TV show. Stupid bitch nigger, I hope you drown. That'll turn my frown upside down. I heard about Issa Rae, like most people, seeing her web series. In "Awkward Black Girl" she showed what we look for in all of our shows. We want the audience to recognize themselves. On the comedy side, we want them to be able to laugh in recognition. Issa showed she was willing to put herself out there and mine her own humanity for laughs. Call me Lil Kim, because I got to crush on you, want to make you my boo, carpool with you to school. Be staring at you in geometry, fantasize about you on top of me, I'm a virgin, but I promise thee, I got that ill nana. No foxy. The development process with HBO was long, but necessary. Issa had an initial idea for the show, we went into HBO, we pitched it to Amy Gravitt and Casey Bloys. It was set in the nonprofit world and it was about my experiences and it still was kind of similar to "Awkward Black Girl", but I didn't want repeat that. I was nervous, I was reading off of the paper in the meeting. I can't just engage people, like "Look at my show"! I was like, this is what it's about to be. They bought it in the room. They said, "Exciting, let's do it." Then we were development about a year and a half, two years. When I tell you, coming from the internet world, I was like, I can make this now, what is the problem? She had this notion that she wanted to do a workplace comedy. The idea was centered more around what became, "We Got Y'all". We'd meet as she was developing the outline and talk about the script. But also she had stories about a friend of hers. At one point she even showed us a text and it then Casey was like, that's the show! It's you and your friend and the world around both of you. He did not sad face you, I will slap you... Bish, what? That's my life. I got to rewriting. Then I said, fuck it. I'm putting all of my life in here. You hungry? Just... Take it! So I can say this is authentic, this is a real story. And that's when they were like, "Okay, green light." I had to find a show runner. HBO sent a couple people my way. Ashley Holland, an agent, said "Think about Prentice Penny." We met in person when you came to my book signing in Eso Won. Eso Won, yep. Then we ended up using Eso Won for the show. - I wrote you a letter. - Yeah. To tell you what I'd bring to it. But, what was it like to get it? People don't send letters anymore. It went such a long way. Obviously, I hadn't gotten a letter from anybody. I saw we were in the same area, you'd worked in the nonprofit world. So I thought you got it. By the time you came to the book signing, I already thought you were cool. And I hadn't read shit that you did until I already said yes. I was just like, he seems cool. But you helped me make every decision. And camera, action. The director process, to find one was soul crushing. HBO wanted someone established. They wanted someone with a name. We found someone and they flew me to New York to meet this director. After that meeting, I was like, "I don't think he gets this show." We had other directors I loved, but still didn't get the show to me. Casey said, "If you had to take a risk, who would you want?" I said I'd been following Melina Matsoukas, who could be dope. People didn't give opportunities to directors like me. I had done music videos and ads. I had really broken in that space, but it didn't translate to film and TV. So I was offered series I didn't relate to. When I read this, I saw myself in the words, fell in love with her on the page. And then I met her and I was like, "She ain't bad. We can collaborate." We did a Skype meeting and it was terrible. It was like, "you knew we're seeing other directors, you didn't prepare". I was on the East Coast, visiting my family. The wifi wasn't working, it was hard to connect. I knew I liked them, they weren't sure if they liked me yet. Her rep was like, "How did it go?" I was like, "Tell her to come correct." And she was like, let me get her another meeting, I woke prep her. I watched every comedy pilot possible, I put together a reel treatment and pitch deck and I brought it with me and that meeting was phenomenal. It was everything. She blew us away. We knew she was the one. With the pilot, I didn't think about it as something that hadn't been done. I thought about it as how I approach any project. I wanted to get inside of who Issa Dee was, what influenced her, who she spoke to and for. I wanted everything to feel authentic to that character. So do y'all have any questions? Don't be shy guys, fire away. When editing, she called me up and said, "Come watch my cut." "I want someone else's feedback." And she played it back for me. I'll never forget this, but I watched that cut, I got really emotional and it was almost like I was silent. And she was like, "You hate it." I was like, "No, they'll love it." It was the first time I realized how important this show could be and how I hadn't seen a black woman represented in that way. This show was going to be a success. I knew, there is no way people can see this beautifully crafted pilot, beautifully shot, beautifully acted, its humanity, comedy relatability. How could you not give it a chance? And legend has it that, when we got a serious pickup, it was one of the fastest pickups in HBO's history. That shows the love and energy put into getting that pilot right. START OF PRODUCTION SEASON 5 Look at us looking like a Diversity brochure. I remember the first audition I went in for jalapeno poppers. - Tasha. - For Tasha. The description said hood hot. And I was like, I am not hood hot because you have to know your strengths. I'm shaped like an iPhone, sleek lines and rounded edges. I knew I wasn't going to get cast. So was like, "Vicky, I won't book this. Is there anything else? She's like, "They got early 30s. Ivy league graduate". That's me! Sophomore year, you hooked up with a Lisa Turtle lookalike. That's different. Women can hook up and we're not considered gay. It's different for men. My first audition with Vickie was, how come I don't know you? Because it's LA and nobody knows a little black girl like me, who don't have no agent, no nothing. After it was done she was like, "You're good. You're good." She really stepped up every time she came back to audition. You'd give her a note, she'd take it. She was a diamond in the rough. Sorry, but I'm not looking for a relationship. Sad face. The fourth one, that was like, oh, if y'all don't want me... That's how I felt walking down Rodeo Drive and Beverly. - I think I skipped. - I will see you soon. It was the scene where we had the fight in the car. The slam lock is on. And I couldn't get out. I was like, I'm going to go for it. And I said "open the damn door". Motherfucker, open the door. The child lock's on. They were like, "That's funny." I was like, that was a choice. I felt really good after that. Between audition three and four, it was between paying my cell bill and getting a private coach. I was like, I'll have to get coach. I hope they can contact me, because Sprint is dead! I'm the only one that's been a director, cast member and writer. It's been incredible. Natasha went from being a writer to being Kelli in a very specific way. A lot of times we'll read it to see, how does it feel. She read Kelli so great that we couldn't imagine anybody as funny as Natasha was being Kelli. Ever see lock up abroad? They going to lock a broad up. God, a favorite Kelli line. That is so hard. I improvise so much. I don't remember what's an actual line or something I've said or something I've said never made the air. I like "remember me different", only because I say that in my real life all the time. Fuck it, you said Beyonce. Remember me different. It's like, look at me doing this. I also love "you know what that is?" It's gross. You a big girl. We wanted to make a good show at the end of the day. I was talking to Jonathan at the end. He said, "You know this never works?" "There's always a power play between a creator and a show runner." The first time you bucked up, although it's the wrong word, was in the depiction of Lawrence. That made such a difference, he could have been written differently if we didn't have your perspective, as a man. As a man, what he not going to do. I heard about "Insecure" from Clarence Hammond. "Have you heard of Insecure?" I was like, "No, what's that?" "It's Issa Rae's new pilot at HBO. Read it, there's a character for you." I read the script and I'm thinking he's talking about Daniel, not Lawrence. Lawrence is on the couch, eating cereal. He forgot his girl's birthday. I'm just getting my shit together. You've been doing that for four years, Lawrence. I never imagined the guy thought Lawrence was the character for me. And I remember walking in and I did Lawrence first. My shoulders were hunched over. I didn't want to be there. But I felt that's where Lawrence was in his head. I put my sides down, turned around and I was like, bam, let's do this. And all of a sudden was like a whole new person to do Daniel. I was like, I booked that. Three weeks later, I get a call. "They want to test you on Insecure." Cool. I never asked my rep what character they wanted to test me on. I thought I'd read for Daniel again. Then found out it was Lawrence. So what are you saying? I didn't think Lawrence would make it past the first season, let alone the first episode. Jay Ellis is so great. I think about Breaking Bad. Jesse wasn't a main character, he was supposed to follow Walt. And Jesse, is obviously the show and I think about that with Jay Ellis. He was great. We always want see what Lawrence is doing. The moment I knew the show was a success was after our season finale. Prentice said, "People will go crazy over the finale." I read it and I thought it's not that crazy of an ending. But then I realized I was going to be butt naked. When I logged onto Twitter, just independent of anything, saw people tweeting about Issa and Lawrence. I'm not on the hashtag. But on my entire timeline, people talked about these two characters. I thought it was incredible. They were invested in them. I didn't see it coming. But it hit people. I haven't seen a sex scene hit people like that before. We wanted to celebrate the bodies of men on this show in the way that they weren't on other shows, as opposed to the female body. I like that wording. I did an interview with a magazine. Did I ever tell you this? A woman asked me, why is the sex so graphic? Is that how blacks do it? - What? - On God. White woman? What kind of white? Euro white? American white? Karen white? I told my family not to watch. I tried to tell them. They said... You naked on Instagram anyway. What's the issue? But it's my titties, not my dick. Or my ass. Cue marker. - Hey. - Hey. Sorry. I wasn't trying to scare you. When you ended things, I understood. I had a son on the way, I was moving, but things changed. I'm changed. I'd hate to leave here tonight knowing that I could have said something and I didn't. Or like, I didn't fight hard enough for you. Thank you. That was passion. I loved how you were making the point. I want to try a take where time is of the essence. Talk, because you don't know how much time you actually have. - Okay? - Cool. Prentice is mad at me because he's team Lawrence. He acts like he's unbiased, but he's not. I'm going to get it out of him, I'll figure out the finale. I always rooted for Issa and Lawrence. In season four, I thought some things just don't work out. They tried. In season five, I don't know if I was team Lawrence. Early on in our conversations Issa the person was like, Issa the character would be a dumb bitch to stay with Lawrence. But throughout the season, she asked, does that have to be the way? And Issa, the person also got on board with that ending too. Last year, with the episode where Lawrence and Issa have a night together, we basically wrote an episode about how they're soulmates. By the time we got to this season, we'd told the world they're soulmates, so they have to end up together, we'd say the protagonist doesn't deserve to be with her soulmate. So there was no other way to end the show. - Tonight made me happy. - You make me happy. When we first talked about Issa's arc as a character, we talked a lot about what it meant for her to stay at We Got Y'all. There was something limiting about. Why is she still here, if she established she don't want to be here.? Even with her romantic arc in the beginning, by the end of season one, she's going to kiss Daniel. If our goal is to show a flawed black woman, who isn't all perfect, then we have to show her make flawed decisions. That means quitting your job without knowing what's next. Or fucking the dude, not just kissing him. Or lying to your partner and then talking to this guy at your event. What bad things she could do that she can correct from, that make her more dynamic and more believable as a character? One of the things I was looking for was learning from the way of things I had been seeing for seven years. I knew I didn't want repetitive voices. Like, if I have a black woman, I don't need any other black women. And no black women can speak for all black women. Agents sent us voices that felt like, "I'm going to send you eight Issa's." But I was like, I have Issa. I don't need eight Issa's. I need something contrary to Issa. Writing on Insecure has been a fulfilling experience. It's the safest I've felt a in room, I never felt like anything I pitched was too stupid or too bad, I could say anything. Every season, we wanted to make each other laugh and make Issa laugh. It felt like a talk with friends, where you happen to create a plot. You have to let writers have lives, to be able to make a show. Otherwise, they're just in a writers room all the time. Prentice arranged happy hours on Fridays and events on weekends. We went to Disneyland, which that made us feel like friends, and it jst made us better at our jobs because we were open and sharing and giving ourselves to the content. I was proud of the rooms we assembled. We didn't have a lot of turnover in our room. The first three seasons we're all the same writers. Then obviously as a blessing, those writers got opportunities We replenished with four more writers who stuck with us to the end. Morning. When Issa comes to me, she goes on a vacation. She's on some island right now. I like early calls. They mean you get out earlier, sometimes. It's always great to be able to work. For me, it always starts at the top. However the lead is, that's what you get. And we're doing good here with our lead. I'm old school, I can go back to working on Martin. And I did the Bernie Mac Show. Been doing this for a minute, but this is an amazing talent, because you're working with a younger, amazing people that have taken this industry to another level. With their creativeness. I love that. This is my time to make love to the hair. I always say that her hair and my hands have a love affair. She likes my hair more than she likes me. I love you too! I love you too. But this hair is everything, it's my favorite. I found out about Awkward Black Girl because natural hair was emerging. At hat time I was running around with Jill Scott who help a lot of people to look at natural hair very differently. People told me to see Awkward Black Girl. Her hair is natural. I remember a time where you'd see a woman with short hair or Afro, and not think much about it, but they made it a really big deal that Issa had natural hair and had cut it off and talked about that on her show. So I started watching it and I was like, this is good. I get it. And every now and then I'll get messages from women saying, "I can't wait for the next season to see what you do with the hair." Because I get ideas for work and going out. And it's great that you are anticipating the next season or episode for the hair. When I look back at the photos I've taken of the hairstyles, it's like a thousand hairstyles, it's crazy. I do not plan them. They are kind of like a creation between Issa and I in the morning. Sometimes I have an idea, but once I see the wardrobe, it could change. It's off the cuff. There's our superstar. I'm so glad we're doing this. Me too. Let me show you what our brand partnership looks like. Brand perception and awareness are up significantly... I didn't want to make a comedy that looked like any other comedy. Cinematically we could push this and allow it to live in a different space because it's a specific show so it should have its own look. Everything was based in authenticity and having it feel as real as possible, lighting black people in a way that I was used to, celebrating their bodies and their skin and their joy. We were successful the first year. Second year, Ava came on board. She came from indie film. I loved her work and aesthetic. I already had strong ideas on what I would do differently. There were some missed opportunities visually, with incorporating cinematography into the DNA of the show. One of the things I said when went in there was you're missing how cool this show is, you're missing literal color in people's skin, in Los Angeles, the warmth, the architecture. I wanted to feel the environment more in this visual storytelling. Insecure is more than a comedy. It's part of a cultural movement, part of visual culture and I wanted it to be that, to show up for that. We're going to try to do this again with them. Everybody look at me, I want to make sure nobody's blocked. Just make sure I don't lose you. Nathan? Yeah? All the girls look great. I think Kelli looks amazing. She looks good right? Did you tell her about that? As soon when she got here. I said, you look beautiful. - I'm going to tell her again. - Do it. I love the floral. I love this, great. He has decent shoes. - Can I get a raise? - I don't control that. Costumes are like cinematography, which is like production design. There's a story in all of it. I believe in how we tell a story visually. The show is also about the diversity of black people and women. Each person must have their own style and sense of expression. You know your neck's not long enough for these turtlenecks? I'm exchanging all these. Condola got me meeting in fancy spots. I gotta change my wardrobe. First and second season we'd have clothes, but limited budgets. In the pilot when Issa was on stage, she said, that's my outfit. I was like, this is perfect. - You love this. - I do. It's cute and it looks good on her. But then are we wasting it here? I loved this too, but with a different shirt. When I started at Insecure, the aesthetics of the main characters were already carved out. That was a unique challenge because I continued that narrative, but added my own twist, my own personal touch. For Issa, we elevated her a little bit and that was really exciting to see. Diversity is always top of mind. In addition to the team we hire, we focus on using and shooting and purchasing designers of color, black women, young up and comers in LA. That's a way to support financially, designers of color from our community. When it came to work on episode 507 with Amy, I suggested only featuring black female designers on our principles. We wanted to feature black female designers for every aspect, from the earrings to the shoes to of course, all of the clothing. She was really up for it. It presented a lot of challenges, but it gave us an opportunity to support black female designers in a way that we haven't done on the show. We've obviously incorporated them, but never a true focal point. It played into the story of these women coming together one of the last times and supporting each other as they move on to different experiences. I'm directing episode 507, called "Chilling, okay?" It's special. All the girls are together almost the entire episode. It's like you're planning to go out and then you never make it out. It's playback action camera, you start smoking and then on action Issa, you deliver your line. I've been working on Insecure since the beginning. I feel like I worked on pre-Insecure, because I wrote for Missadventures of Awkward Black Girl. Insecure has different levels of directors and a lot of new talent. Many friends ask me from season one, are you going to direct? I was like, "No, this show, it's so hard." Growing as a producer on set, supporting many different directors and seeing how they work, I felt like for four seasons, I was shadowing directors. Not about to argue with someone who wants a... All right, let's cut. When I came to Insecure, it was the first time I'd been on a set where people of color were at the top. The vibe on set and the people, it was diverse for real. It wasn't PA diverse, it wasn't one person over here diverse. It was diverse in all aspects. This is the first show I've been on, where, when I get into a scout van, which includes director, cinematographer, assistant director, that I'm the only white guy in the van. That is the first time in 30 years that that's ever happened. I'm not straight, so there were no straight white guys in the van. I see many women in the camera department because I make it that way. This show has been about giving people that shot. I was given that shot and I want to give it to others. When it comes to giving chances, people will show you they're ready. And I love passionate people. I love to be around people who love to do the work. That tells you all you need to know. First time I met Issa was 2009. Issa did this workshop. The Insecure onset contest HBO put on. At the end of 2016, the winners got to move to LA and work on the show as set PAs. Afterwards, I stood in line and talked to her. "I'm writing now." I hadn't had any real eyes on my work yet. I was so bold. Even though I was PA-ing, I tried to let people know I'm a writer, talking to Issa whenever I could. She read my pilot script and Issa personally emails me. "Hey Kindsey, not sure what you're up to, but we have a spot opening up for writer's assistant, if you're interested". And I'm like, of course I'm interested. I dropped everything and I came to become a show runner's assistant and a writer's PA for season one of Insecure. Now I'm a showrunner of Rap Shit for HBO Max. It's crazy. Six years ago, none of those people had professional writing jobs and now they're show runners and writers on other shows. I see how in five seasons, we've given eight first time directors their opportunity to direct their first episode of TV. I think seven writers over the last five seasons, got their own deals. Six writers from these five seasons went on to become showrunners. We've hired and broken in two costume designers, a new DP, and across the board, you really see growth. That is a testament to their legacy and to the legacy of the show. We always tried to open many doors for as many people as possible. I met Issa Rae at a 7/11 randomly, years ago, before Insecure. We talked about Hollywood and what we each do. Years later, she's very successful. I have a wife and kids and I'm trying to figure out how support my family. I thought getting into a union is one of my best opportunities. When COVID hit I was discouraged, didn't think it was gonna happen. I happened to work on a show with one of the producers from Insecure. I was wearing an Insecure hoodie or a hat. And he asked, "Do you know Issa? Do you work on the show?" I said, "I do." I was telling her about how hard it is to get into a union and she said to me, there's always a way. If I can get you on the show and help count towards your days, that's a win. It's also a win for inclusion and making sure that this show is continuing to create opportunities. Fast forward a few months and I got a call. It worked out. This show means so much to me, it's helping me take care of my family. I can go home and look at my wife and she's proud of me. At the beginning of this season we'll have an art walk in this area. And we should look for artists in Crenshaw and Inglewood, black artists in particular. Creatively it took a good three weeks, but to physically put it together, we did it in two days. Issa is very specific in embracing all the locations that we've seen in all five seasons. If it wasn't going to be Leimert Park Plaza, there wasn't really an option. It wasn't really an option. Look who's over here shopping! The Black Art Walk is an event where Los Angelian African American artists show off their work. As with everything Issa Dee does, there's a verisimilitude that has to do with what the real world is doing and what she's doing in the show. Her master plan was she was going to come down here and spend the money for us to be working in this community. It ain't Insecure if we don't have a block party, if we don't have... In the neighborhood where the blacks are... Hello? I'm trying to shoot over here. Oh, it's the black Yukon. Suge Knight is coming through, I don't know who's there. I said, it's not Insecure if we don't have a big... Y'all disrespect other actresses like this? Oh, now it's a party. You know what? This is why we do what we do. They said, "Oh, the cameras is rolling? We have a party." I love it. So you were saying, how does it feel to shoot in a black neighborhood? This is how. It's a cookout, a party, we going to get in on it too. It's not only Issa Dee, but Issa Rae's desire and mission to promote the black community, especially, one where there's so much culture, art and feeling here. That's what Insecure does best. We show how alive this area is. It's not just the Hollywood Hills or Sunset Boulevard. Inglewood, Leimert Park, we got stuff here too. Three weeks ago, we were shooting down in Manhattan beach. I went down Hyde Park Street, where the Dunes apartment is. There was three families taking photos and we shot the Dunes like season two or three. People are still going to the Dunes, taking photos of Insecure. It is proven to be a lot of positivity, acceptance from this show. I'm extremely proud of Issa. It's wild to me that the Dunes is a cultural landmark. You don't think about those things when you're filming. We moved out of those apartments by season two. I get tagged three or four times a day by people in pictures. It's dope. They treat it like the Hollywood sign. When Insecure started, it was like pulling teeth. We were set on creating a certain authentic look to the show. We realized the vets in the industry weren't really used to that. We asked them to go to neighborhoods that other shows didn't film in. We asked for locations never filmed at. We fought hard for that. It's refreshing being able to show new places, whether it's neighborhoods or businesses, on television. In South LA, it's different protocols you have to go by. You go into certain neighborhoods, you must deal with hood logistics. You have to know the politics of Leimert Park in order to film. Everybody knows and loves Issa. She employs a lot of black people. She puts a spotlight on communities that other TV shows don't. We got to see the great people who live and make this community work and all of the great cultural things that it has to offer. I grew up on Normandie in Florence. Anyone who's outside of LA know it is because that's where the riots started in the 90s. That's not the best representation of LA, but it is what it is. I rep my city pretty hard and it feels really good to see the LA that we know and love represented as opposed to the one Hollywood typically portrays for us. Everywhere we shoot is my stomping ground. In the Baldwin Hills Plaza, people I grew up with is our security. To work and see my friends and they see me doing this... look at my smile. It's really dope. I love the thug Yoda representation, because it's humanizing somebody who's "blood" from our neighborhood. - We was about to watch the bear bears. - Care Bears, Daddy. You have these type of relationships with these people. It's an accurate description because it represents the side that's not shown. Yoda was based off of someone I'd seen at the post office, in Inglewood. I dropping my mail off. Super hood post office. It was a dude on the phone with his daughter in his arm, cussing. "Yeah, nigger. Don't fucking play me." And he would be like, "You good baby? All right, yeah..." I was like, this is a character. Come on to the Brenshaw Mall. - Oh shit! - Oh, shit! I'm glad when I see a cafe I go to or a barber's my son goes to, on my street on HBO and with a bunch of white people watching, but just let's not continue all the gentrification. South LA is great, but you can stay in another neighborhood. I don't know why I told you about this neighborhood. Y'all take everything. Can we have anything? Leave! I've been blamed for gentrification. The show has been blamed for it. Something went LA viral on Twitter where this girl posted, I went to Worldwide Tacos, and I didn't like them. She misquoted Worldwide Tacos as being in Inglewood. So people were like, "Bitch, go home. This is Issa's fault." "Didn't nobody tell you to review these tacos?" Anyway... And I was like, damn. It's the beauty and the blessing of exposing these businesses but then locals being mad that people come in here being overly familiar with these places that are so dear to us. We had a nice shoot on Saturday. I got called at 6:00 PM and we didn't finish until 5:50. We were in the van going back to set. 6:05, I was on my way home. And then today is Monday and I got picked up at 3:54 AM to come here. It's Wednesday. Hi, I'm Issa Rae. Life is so hard. I didn't have a 24 hour... She didn't work on Saturday. She was posting shirtless pictures of her doctor. Sounds like hatred. Someone's mad at my life. But I'm just Issa Rae, I own everything, boohoo. Why do you to laugh? I'm off camera, you know you got to make it worse. - What happened to you? - So bad. I own everything. I heard that finale script dropped last night. - It did. - How do you feel? Good, it's out there. We'll keep retweaking it. You can ask Kira our script coordinator, but I hit her up. I finished it on Saturday and said we'll send it out in the morning. Then I dreamt about it and wanted to change it. Kira said she could recall it. So I made another change and then had another idea. I was like, "Kira, did you send it?" She was just about to. Then I read something up, literally three times, because the cast and crew are seeing it and I want the first impression to at least be... We know we're keep working on this, but I still feel confident in it. And when I think about, actors who dedicated five years to this show and crew members, if it just ends with a, "Aw man, that's it?" I don't want that feeling: "I dedicated my life for five years and this is it?" So I wanted to make sure that it was all represented and I'm excited for the table read. A weight was lifted off my shoulders. Issa sighs as Quoia opens a door wide to Crenshaw's Warehouse main room, it's completely dark. Issa steps inside. Coria, why is this so dark? You got a night plumber? - She flips on a switch and... - Surprise! It's Issa's 33rd birthday and they're all gathered to celebrate her. With this show, I'm most proud of the doors that it's opened. It's showing black people's humanity and regular-ness in a time when that wasn't the focus for anything else on television. And opening doors for so much other talent behind the scenes, in front of the camera. That's what we'll be known for, just like "Girlfriends" and all the other legendary shows that that came before us. Thanks for coming and making me look good in front of my new client. We got you girl. - Let's take a photo. - You got it. - Now let's do a fun one. - No, we're good. I love that I got to play Tiffany. At first, it was more a trope of the bougie light skin, AKA. - Where's Tiffany? She mad at me? - Don't know. She hide in the closet. Yes, I know he's our little weed baby, but I just want to be home with you. And we got to see her develop into a mom, into a more compassionate friend, into the truth teller of the gang. We're all doing great, look at you getting fit, look at Kelli. Look at Molly, taking interviews, taking names. Look at Issa. I feel like people have come to see Tiffany as part of this legacy of bougie black women in television, from Hillary Banks to Whitley Gilbert. To be in the company of that, within the African American cultural cannon is just a dream. All right, let's do it, everybody pictures up. Good, cut. It is time to say series rap on Natasha Rothwell. When I got the show I was like, I don't know if I can do this. It's very vulnerable for me to say, but it's just true. Over six years, the show taught me that you can grow into those positions and to meet those expectations. We're limiting ourselves when we take those risks and have the courage to just try. Again, it's about visibility and not one singular black female voice. And yet Issa's voice is singular and I'm excited for disruption, shaking the table and infusing the culture of Hollywood with more black female voices. Now we are inside of an international hotel. It's a party. Everyone's dressed up, drinking and mingling. At some point, I'll crane back out, but we're craning in. It'll be super loose and then... That's the scene. The steady cam will be coming behind you. Let's make a wedding! Smile at her, yeah. Listen to me, don't... Just smile. Smile at her. Molly has been a delicious character to embody. She taught me things, I think I thought her some things. Though these are writer's words, I'd like the think that I brought my growth and my healing to her, but she also brought her growth and her healing to me. By the time we get to the end of season five, she finds herself. - And cue Jay. - Action Jay. I never thought about where Lawrence's story should go, from season to season, I was here for Issa's story. So whatever Issa wants is what I want to do. Being able to bring Lawrence's journey full circle from who he was at first, from a dude sitting on the couch, crippled in fear, who couldn't take care of himself, much less anyone else... To see him come full circle to being a father going after what he wants, being okay with himself and knowing "I have figured myself out, and this is the type of relationship that I want in my life"... And it's crazy, because it feels so real. We have to wrap up this day with the very multifaceted emotional news that this is an Insecure series wrap on Jay Ellis. Now we're done, it's the people, man. Right here. - Nigger, we did it. - Love you too. That shit. He did it. Y'all sill got something to do. It's rare to go to work every day and love not only the work, but the people that you're with. And for all of us to walk out six years later and still love each other, it's all you could dream for. It's all you could... Thank you. It's all... All you could dream for in a show. - What's up? - It's the black Santa. I'm going to miss every person we've had on our production, from sound to camera and Issa. And Issa. It is very rare to have... the creator of your show be your costar and your biggest champion. I'll miss the shit out of it. The party's over. Issa helps Molly take her wedding dress off. Issa unzips the complicated dress and Molly sway still tipsy. Okay, just one more row. How you feeling girl? Happy. Like really, really happy. As long as you're around, I'm going to be okay. Yeah. Me too. - I love you. - I love you too. And cut. - Let's cut. Let's keep it quiet. - That's it. All right, everybody, bring up the house lights and come here. I gotta scream or I'm going to start crying, let's go. No... This is a serious wrap day... Damn it. This is a series wrap on Yvonne Orji. Man, thank you all so much. Come on! For real, thank you guys. Issa, I owe so much to you. We all do. I'm grateful I got to rock with you by your side as your number two for six years. You changed the heck out my life. Everybody, cast, crew, writers, Prentice, I love the heck out of y'all. We did it. We made a show. The role I'm most proud of is not even being Molly, it's just being able to serve you. That's what I take so much pride in. I've wanted to protect you because you literally were the head. And I know that heavy is the head that wears the crown. We did it. We did it! We always said the true love story of Insecure is Issa and Molly. We wanted to show you can get to a place, not with every friend, but in this friendship, at least, that they were growing at different paces and eventually lined up and grew in sink again, by the end. They realized that no, you're my person. You're my friend. For life. This wasn't a friendship for a reason or a season. But one for a lifetime. We ain't shit for some tricks. Hello, what? Pick up the phone, hello? You're so stupid. Bottoms up! This spiked? I love you. We are saying goodbye and goodnight and a series finale to Prentice Penny. I don't know why I still have this, I'm COVID tested. When we met, I always felt like, if I was a young Issa, how would I want my person, a showrunner to be? It was very important for me that I walk away from this that you could say, he helped me make the show I wanted to make and he never got in the way once. That was always my north star. You realize you're just a brick in somebody else's story and you have a bigger function to serve. I think about all the times I was the only black writer in rooms and going through the things I went through for 17 years, good and bad, I tried to pour all of what I knew, everything I learned, every skillset, to pour it into you. You exceeded and went farther than I could have dreamed for you. The beauty is that you'll never know those things that I saw, you only create a new path and I will miss you so much. I love you. And... Yeah, I don't know. I love you. Thank you. - What will I do without you now? - You'll be fine. You got 18 shows. Baldwin Hills Last Day of Production And action. Poor thing. She went to bed at four. Had a 8:42 call time, I just looked at it. That's what happens when you have your own show. Go ahead, baby. I hope in the future that people see that it was a classic. I really feel like it was a beautiful picture of how we live now. When you think back to our era, you'll think back to Insecure. But I also hope that other shows will follow in our footsteps and diversify that landscape. And that's a cut of the last shot of Insecure, the HBO series. That is a series wrap on our queen! Let's go. You guys, I am just incredibly humbled, blessed. I'm honored to know a lot of you. When I set out to do this... Y'all know me. I'm not the most talented person, I'm not the funniest person. I'm not the best person... But you aspire and you dream and you imagine, and I never imagined I'd get to work with all of you in support of this and to meet so many amazing, talented people. I think about my loved ones, my brothers and sisters and cast. You guys elevated me. I've learned so much from you along the way. I've learned so much about myself through you and am blessed to be in your presence and to know I have family for life. That's a wrap! When I look at other shows growing up, I had not seen a family like mine in black television until I saw Cosby. That show inspired me to think my idea of life can be on screen and it made me believe it was possible. So if I had to distill it down, I'd hope people would watch Insecure and go, "Achieving at a high level, creatively, opportunity-wise, is possible." And sometimes in this country, you don't always get to think things that look like you are possible. That's what I hope its legacy is. Whatever people need it to be, to know that it's possible. - How do you feel to be done baby? - Baby, I'm tired. All right. You're too pretty, baby. I started this shit. I ended this his. We're done! Insecure, bitch! I love you. I love you. Can we go eat? The hardest working people in showbiz. - Love you boo. - I love you more. I want it to go down as people's favorite show, it's super simple. In the way that I talk nostalgically about the shows that shaped me, that make me smile when I think about them, that I reflect on a specific time in my life, happily, I want our show to do the same. I want people to think about scenes and the first time they watched them and imagine where they were in their lives. I want it to be a part of who they are. That would make me happy. INSECURE: THE END
