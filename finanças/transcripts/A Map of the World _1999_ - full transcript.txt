That's all. ♪ ♪ ♪ How come Theresa doesn't come around anymore? If Mom can't ever come home, can we go live with Theresa sometimes? So we can be with a lady? She has a family of her own. But I want Theresa. I want Theresa. I want Theresa! I want Theresa! I want Theresa! Oh my... God... Excuse me. She don't even know what hit her. - Hmm. - Who? Dyshett. Some of them girls were saying Dyshett beat on you, but... I seen it. I seen every single move. Just when Dyshett was about to get on you... ...you went into a blur.

I don't care if she builds a golf course. Well of course, you know, extensive renovation will be required, so... That's why your offer will be considerably less. Look, t-to be honest with you my sister is dying of leukemia. The medical bills, as I'm sure you can imagine... - Oh I'm so sorry. - Please just make it happen. You want me to? 'Dear Alice... I think I'd be a good used car salesman.' Um... 'Mainly because I've lost all of what you used to imagine were my redeeming qualities. I'm no longer calm, or moderate. This afternoon Emma called me a liar. I'm sorry about bringing the girls. It was a mistake. Claire and Emma have learned to cry like adults. They sit by themselves and cry without making much noise.' ♪ 'We need you with us for plenty of reasons, but... ...not least to gently help the girls shake off a few years so they can again have a tantrum. What a relief that would be. Howard.' ♪ ♪ Come on. What kind of kids you got? We're playing. What? What are their names? Dyshett... I said that we were playing. How old are they? Shit!

Don't cry Miss Alice... I got two babies. Just like you. Sorry I haven't come down. Haven't taken Emma and Claire. I felt kinda mixed up for a while. I didn't feel like I could see you. How's Alice? I've gotten a letter every day this week. She's terrified I'm gonna sell the farm. She always knows. Well we can't stay here anymore. It's obvious. Even if she's acquitted... ...but you love it here.

Don't you Alice... Did you ever think of putting that chair over by the window? No. Not really. Well here, I'm gonna help you. Grandma, what are you doing? Oh, just a little redecorating. Mom... Put it back. Well I'm happy to see you too. You look so handsome. So official. Now tell me, aren't you glad this great farm experiment is over? Tommy Gidding's mother was a waitress in the same restaurant where Carole Mackessy worked. Norman Frasier's mother is her hairdresser, and Donna Stuck's mother is her best friend. I leaked this coincidence, and miraculously, all three dropped their charges. Even better! The judge has approved my motion to keep any mention of Lizzy, the drowning, the whole episode... out! It's inadmissible. And for dessert... God. We have Mrs. Shepherd. Oh... You are going to love her! Love her! She's gonna be our, o-our star witness with higher billing than even you! Having fun? I wouldn't be any good if I didn't. But, you can rest assured, rest assured that I'm enjoying the prospect of getting our story, the real story, out! So she unzipped the pants first, and then she unbuttoned them? I forget! Do you like your Mom's boyfriends? Objection. Your t.v. has 64 channels. Wow! And your mom lets you watch whatever you want? Yep! Do your mother's boyfriends ever stay the night? Objection! Did you ever see naked people on t.v.? Is the court paying for tissue? She tied me to the chair. She tied you to the chair? - She said she'd bite me. - Did she bite you? She said she'd bite me if I moved. She said my blood would come out! Your blood? She always pushed me down. So, the nurse, tied you to the chair, and pushed you down. - Yes. And she bit you. Yes! So Mrs. Goodwin tied you to the chair, pushed you down, and bit you? Stop asking me that, you're hurting me! I'm hurting you? I said, you're hurting me! No further questions, your honor. You know I wish... You wish? What do you wish? That that Robbie Mackessy had been the one to drown. Oh Howard, not now. Well wouldn't he be better off at this point? I swear I've never met anybody like Reverdy before. Makes me sick. Makes me feel like I want to vomit. Uh-huh. I'm gonna get the girls. Or we'll be charged for the next hour. You know, you never listen to me! You know that? Howard... I am listening. I just don't know what else to say. Robbie didn't drown. Lizzy did. If not Reverdy, who? Maybe I should have copped a plea, and served a sentence. Would you have liked that? I could say 'I'm sorry' every minute for the rest of my life, and it still wouldn't be enough. I'm sorry for Lizzy, I'm sorry for Robbie, I'm sorry for Theresa, I am sorry Reverdy makes you sick. I'm sorry for you, and for Emma, and for Claire. I'm sorry! I am just plain sorry! And maybe, just maybe... Reverdy will get me off. And we can try to begin again. Or whatever. I didn't believe him at first. Then he started getting nightmares. Would you like some water? No, ma'am. Please continue. I didn't know what to think. I kept asking him, and he told me the same story over and over. And I still didn't believe him. Then he started wetting the bed. I just knew something bad had happened. So... You came to the house to have sex? Correct. After the sex, did you ever spend the night? No. Where was Robbie... when, you and... his mother were... ...having sex? I don't know. Robbie came to my door. He looked so frightened. He took me by the hand... Where did he take you? He took me into his house. Into the den. This isn't easy for me. I appreciate that. Mrs. Shepard, what did you see? It was dark, the music was loud. But I could see her. Mrs. Mackessy. Naked. Tied to a chair. And a man was behind her. Biting her neck. I'm gloating. I'll pay for it someday. But I can't help it right now. I'm gloating. What is it Alice? Surprise. Yes, we were neighbors and friends. Did your children play together? Very often. Several times a week. Did you ever... ...suspect Alice Goodwin of... Neglect? Or foul play? No. You never saw anything.. Any... Signs, or any flares to alert you? Never. Your daughter was always happy to go t- Daughters. I'm sorry. Your daughters were always happy to go to the Goodwins? Yes. Thrilled. Would you allow... your daughter to stay unchaperoned with the Goodwin family at this time? I can't impress upon you enough that Alice would never inflict... She never did any of those things. Objection. Answer the question please. Mrs. Collins... Would you allow your daughter to stay unchaperoned with the Goodwin family at this time? Yes. Woo! Sexual abuse, reckless endangerment, child abuse. And how did you plead? Not guilty. And how did you find the jail? Objection. Your honor, I think my client deserves the chance to say a few sentences about the time she spent in jail as a result of these charges. She was beaten, and suffered a severe injury. So severe, she had to be hospitalized. You may proceed. Now, how did you find the county jail? I was in awe. You were what? I was in awe of the women there. Not an experience you'd care to repeat, I take it? No, but... In all of the... what? 25 visits we have recorded here, Mrs. Goodwin... Did you ever touch Robbie in an inappropriate way? I'm sorry, what was the question? Did you ever touch Robbie Mackessy in an inappropriate way? Yes. Godamnit Alice! I don't know- How could- I don't know what the fuck you think you're doing! I told the truth. You told the truth. Something you neglected to tell me! I don't know what to do, Howard. I don't know what to do. Let Oprah be the judge. Oh Jesus. Let me, and Robbie, and Mrs. Mackessy and Howard, and Theresa, and Dan... Let all of us come before Oprah. And let the studio audience decide. You just tell me what you did to that fucking kid. I hit him once on the face. It was a slap. Robbie was a difficult kid to treat. He was disrespectful, he made personal remarks... His contempt overwhelmed me one day... ...and I slapped him. I know that's no excuse. Is slapping Robbie Mackessy one of the charges that's been brought against you? No. What did you mean... Mrs. Goodwin, when you said to... ...Detective Groban and Officer Melby: that "I hurt everbody."? What did you mean by that? Our neighbor, a two year old, had just recently drowned in our pond, and I wa- Objection! This is inadmissible! Will Counsel please approach the bench. Are you playing games with me, Paul? Because if you are, you'd better tell me right now and I'll declare a mistrial and we can start this whole thing all over again. Now, Miss Durkin, Your colleague has opened the door, and I want you to know you can have as much latitude as you want. Are you aware... that it is against the law for a school employee to hit a child? Yes, I am. And still you struck Robbie Mackessy? That's correct. Did you report your conduct? No, I did not. So you lived with the knowledge that you hurt Robbie Mackessy, just as you lived with the knowledge of the other abuse? Stick to the facts. "I hurt everybody." That's what you said in your admission to Officer Melby. What do you mean by 'hurt everybody?' Um... For a parent... Not taking action, not doing a certain thing, can be just as damaging as striking a child. Not paying attention. Turning your back, just for a moment... Letting go of their hand when they need you. Sometimes it seems that every minute, there is peril. Everything fell apart those few weeks after Lizzy drowned. The Officers and I... ...we were having a general conversation. Or so I thought. I meant that I was human. And that therefore I had hurt the persons closest to me. Did you tell your husband that you hit Robbie? No. So, you were secretive about it? Yes, I was. It has taken me a long time to know how to remember last year. ♪ ♪ ♪ On occasion I've thought that we are where we belong. City people return to the city.

I understood that forgiveness itself was strong. Durable. Like strands of a web... ..weaving around us. Holding us. It's so good to see you! We are no longer friends, really.
