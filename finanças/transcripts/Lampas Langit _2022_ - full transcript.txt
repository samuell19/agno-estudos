--== McEphie ==-- It was an ordinary day when Jason first laid eyes on Bettina… the girl who would be his "Muse" the quote, unquote - "girl of his dreams". Bettina... who took his breath away when she moaned "I love you so much, Jason" at the peak of her orgasm but not once did Jason ever dream that Bettina would take his fate into her hands, twist it like a pretzel, and irrevocably change it... forever. And now he’s hopelessly in love with the memory of her that echoes in his heart over and over… Bettina... a ghost who relentlessly pursues him… a ghost from another time… another place… Such a hassle... Careful. Can you hurry it up? I told you so. You were in a hurry earlier. Get up! You look stupid! Jake. I'm hungry. Can you cook something? Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake. Jake Hold on. Wait. Jake My, I'm working. Jake. My, Ten minutes. I'm almost done. Look. "He said 'Where are you?'" I'm halfway, look. See? Look at this. Why? Why? He said. I wish it was you. I'm in the middle of... - Look. - Jake. His reaction surprised me. Can you help me instead? Myls. Ten minutes. Give me ten minutes, okay? Jake. Ten minutes. Ten minutes, okay? Wait, Myls. Let me finish this. Fuck! Fuck! I said I'm busy. My. My! My... Hey, Hey! Mylene! Mylene... Motherfucker. Are you scared to lose me, Jake? Fuck! Fuck, My! What's your problem? This is not right. Fine! I'll find myself a new playmate. Then go fucking find a playmate. Fuck you! Asshole! This is fucking wrong. Fuck. Why are you staring at? What are you looking at? What the fuck? Are you gay? There's blood on your lips. Allow me to introduce myself. Arman Fuentez-Diaz. And you are? Arman. Arman Fuentez. The Arman Fuentez-Diaz, the writer? The novelist? Unfortunately, I wanted to write for televisions. Soap operas... Pot boilers. But I don’t write fast enough. I'm Jake. We just moved in last week. Jake de Vera. I figured. Okay. Good luck! Just say hello to the ghosts here. Hold on, Sir. Ghosts? Is this place haunted? This building stands on an old lot. The rumor is, it used to be a cemetery. So there are still energies left behind by the dead. Energies? Memories... Dreams... Lost loves... Broken hearts... Intense emotions... those who commit suicide out of depression and despair, but don't worry, not all ghosts are supernatural, or paranormal. But I’m boring you… No! No sir. Actually, I'm very... Okay, back to reality. Deadlines. Deadlines! - Deadlines! - Okay, sir. It's good to meet you, Sir. Sir! Thank you! Do you have "Mga Gintong Palad (Golden Palms)"? Do you mean, "Mga Gintong Pilak (Golden Silver)", sir? Correct! It's over there, sir. Bottom shelf. How much? Five hundred. - I've missed you! - I miss you! - Hello! - You're back too! Oh my God. How was Boracay? - So fun! You should've come with us! - I saw your photos. I'm green with envy! - Join us next time. - Hold on. Let me fix this. - I like this design! It's so nice! - My God, Yeah! I know. I designed it! You're really good! - Your boobs look great in that suit. - Yeah! No! They're sagging! I haven't been to the gym. Hey, drama queen. If I had your boobs, I'd have them insured for a million bucks! Are they too heavy? - Not really. - My God. I'm used to it. Mine are small. Wanna rent mine? Whatever! They're so heavy! Tell you what, we need a guy's opinion. - Let's go! - Good idea. Jake! Jake! My God! Looks so good on you! - Thank you! - Told you! I know, right? Looks great! My boobs are tiny! - Want to borrow mine? - Chill guys! Chill! I designed several for you gals! Hold on. Honey! - Honey. - Yeah? Hi Jake! Are those great boobs, - or are those great boobs? - How are you, Jake? Yeah. Do that later. Feel it! - Go ahead. - You can touch. Yeah! - Go! - Go! Yeah. They're... They're fine. Fine?! My goodness! Thanks, Jake. Don't feel insecure, okay? I made lots of suits for you. Don't worry. I'll be flaunting these babies. Yeah. Bye bye, Babe. Babe! You're too busy! Bye, Jake! - Try on another one, okay? - Sure! Let's go. I'll get back to you girls. I don't like your shirt. It looks cheap. Come on, you bought it. What are you talking about? You bought it. Jake! The maid! Stupid idiot! Help. Please. Help... Help me... This is wrong! What the heck? I made myself clear! I told you, small! Why is this medium! Jake, I made you coffee. You wait. Here you go. - Go ahead. - Thanks. Go and write. Bye! So what now? You can't do anything right! I told you, small! Why are all of these medium?! Ma'am, that's the size you gave me... Oh, so I was wrong? It's my fault? I didn't mean... Just shut up! Yes, yes. I need those labels by Saturday! It will take me two days to attach them. I told you that. I have a delivery on Monday! Tues... I thought it was settled! Know what? I'll just find another supplier! Stop making excuses! Goodbye! Ah, Jake. - Good evening, Sir. - Good evening. Come in! Come in! Thank you for accepting my invitation, Jake. Actually, sir, I should be thanking you. Mylene, my wife. Hi, sir. Good evening. A pleasure to meet you. Thank you, sir. This is for you. Oh, thank you! You need not have bothered. Actually, sir... What a beautiful husband and wife… the perfect couple, as they say... the guy's good-looking, the woman's seductive, they're obviously bourgeois, educated, well-bred, moneyed, newlyweds, apparently, about to start a new life together. How enviable Oh dear… Pardon a writer's habitat. It's messy, especially when we have deadlines. That's alright, Sir. To tell you the truth, I'm also a writer. Ah, really? What kind of a writer? You know, I really want to become a novelist like you. I was in high school when I began idolizing you, and that's when I started to write. Hopefully, I can achieve my dream. I have a copy of your book. Is it okay if you sign this, sir? Please? "Mga Gintong Pilak (The Golden Silver)" You know, this was inspired by a true story. I'm sure this is a reprint. I could tell that you're a writer too. What do you mean, Sir? How did you know? I could smell it a mile away. What's the joke? Belle, these are our guests, Jake and his wife, Mylene. - Hi. - I immediately saw it. How Jake stared at Belle. His eyes, devouring her… Being a writer, I'm an expert at assessing people.. I know how Jake felt when he first saw Belle... it was as if he slowly fell from a high cliff down to a ravine… or suddenly slipped on a banana peel... but either way, he'll surely break his skull. Please… sit down. Belle, wine for our guests. Your daughter is lovely… Belle? Yes. She takes after her mother. Jake, what would you like to write about? Raunchy... Raunchy love stories. That's what sells nowadays. Ah, millenials... Yes, sir. And also, they have the buying power. - You're right. - Very good. You're thinking of the business side of it. But they're strange bedfellows. Who, sir? Art and Business! Just like us! I mean, like you, Jake is an artist. While I'm an entrepreneur, so we can never get our schedules together. When he's asleep, I'm awake, so it's really difficult to have sex and… You know, do stuff. Arman yakked away the entire evening… about his experiences when he was a new writer, the awards he collected when he was in his forties… Wow, what a life! Really cool. I just kept my eyes on him, assenting to everything he was saying but I couldn’t absorb any of his words Nothing registered, nothing was making sense… Because my mind was set on Belle... The curve of her waist Her lovely, lily-white neck… Her delicate, fragile hands… The touch of her hand... Here's to new friends and neighbors. Cheers. Thank you, sir. Do you like books too? Yes, I do. What are these? Limited edition. Collector's copies. "For Loy and Noreen." - May I take a look? - Sure. What are these names? "For Ramon and Vina." Those are... "Danny and Ysay," who are they? Family, friends. Students in my writing class. They’re so lucky! Their names are now immortalized! Don't worry, Mylene. I'm dedicating my next novel to you and Jake. Really, sir? Oh my God! Thank you! I can't wait! Arman, dinner? Guys? Dinner is served. Sure. Please. "When their hands touched, a jolt of electricity coursed through the body of..." Jules? No, no, no... Jerick? Ah, Jason. Jason. "Jason shakily steals a glance at... Bettina but her face is devoid of emotion. So Jason wonders, 'Did that really happen?' Did our bodies touch even if it was just for a split second? Or... was it his intense desire for Bettina that stirred his imagination? Was it possible that even while he was still on this earth, he had already gone to heaven?" "Beyond Heaven" At long last, I can now use this title... How intriguing. So apt… My editor will be happy. "Everyone could tell that they were newlyweds, just by the glow on their faces, "…shining from a million dreams which lit the path towards their forever life as a married couple." Belle. Jake. You forgot this. Belle? Who is it? Oh, Jake. Sir! I came back for my handkerchief. He forgot it. Come on, Jake. Stop calling me sir. Call me Arman. You also forgot your book. I already signed it. Thank you very much, sir. Jake, since we're friends now. Don't hesitate to come over when you need help with your novel. Okay? Yes, sir. Alright. - Good night. - Good night. Why are you still up? I'm not done with the... Do it tomorrow. Time for bed. How have you been? Fine.. What day do you do the laundry? Depends. Depends on what? Depends on when I have clothes to wash. What's your fabric conditioner? Me? SilkCon? Imported? I don't really know. Mylene buys it. But you do the laundry. She's too busy. And you're not? Actually, doing the laundry helps me think… Of what? Whatever… Story ideas… While I'm watching the clothes swirling about, a calmness comes over me… Like… in meditation? Yeah. She knows Randy is my boyfriend, but she still flirts with him! That maniac! Crazy! She's horny as hell! So I heard! She even fucked her boss, the foreigner? “Standing just a breath away from Bettina, Jason could hear a melody playing inside his head… He knew then that he had fallen in love with Bettina. He compared love to a song that played over and over inside your head... And there was nothing you could do to make it stop… It's like you're trapped in an emotional cul-de-sac…” "Is this how it feels to be in love? I can hardly breath when I'm with Jake. When we're together, everything else disappears and it's just the two of us. It's not only my body that feels this but also the deepest part of my soul. I'm trying to suppress my emotions because I can't fall in love with him..." These tiles are lovely - But of course, nothing beats David - when we went to Spain. Ah, did you know that when you enter a church for the first time, you're allowed three wishes? Really? You believe in that stuff? Yeah. Why not? Okay. But be careful what you wish for. It might just come true. Over there. No! There! Come on! Let the dead envy us. - Wait. - Stay there. What's going on? - Why? - Let's have a quickie before the mass. Right here? Wait. My! My! Can you not? Better go to confession. I'll just take pictures then. Give me a date. Five weeks. Make that four, okay? Four and a half. Jake, I'm only asking for a first draft. "Loving You and Everything Else..." sold very well. But those were just short stories. What you need to do now is follow it up with an honest-to-goodness novel. That's just it. It's harder. It's a novel. You can do it. I know that. But this is a different genre. So much stuff going on there's a bit of Millenial, it's something with a little bit of soulful sex, you know. You think Millenials will go for it? For sure. That's what's missing in their relationships. Boom! Do you have a title? "Love Sick." I smell a bestseller! I love it already, Jake. Thanks. Hi, Belle! How are you? Long time no see. How's your dad? Papa? Yeah. He's okay. Did he meet his deadlines? Not yet... Well, Jake never meets his deadlines. He writes depending on his mood. Naturally... It's so hard to live with a writer, right Belle? I mean, I wouldn’t wish them on anyone! Okay, Belle. Regards to your dad. Weirdo. What do you mean? Nothing. There's just something off about her. She's like a ghost. Floating, you know. Whatever. I can't put my finger on it. "He couldn't explain the topsy-turvy emotions that turned his soul upside down. 'What's the matter with you?" his wife asked, frowning with exasperation. 'You always look like you're out of it. Are you here or on another planet? Did I marry an alien?' He did feel like he was out of his body whenever he thought of that woman. 'Who am I?' he asked himself. 'What am I? He felt like a stranger, even to himself..." I need air. Don't wait up for me. What happened to you? The elevator conked out. Didn't you come from Arman's? I saw you entering their unit. Yes, I stopped by. I took the stairs, then I dropped off something. The elevator was fine when I went up earlier. It acts up. Oh, well. The closet drawer is stuck. Can you fix it? Yeah, sure. I just need to write something down. Oh, okay. - I'll do it after, okay? - Yeah. When he held my breasts and squeezed them, I almost fainted… And when he slid his roaming hand under my skirt and caressed what was between my thighs, my whole body was on fire... although I was so wet… Karl! Karl! Yes? Your Adam's apple's gone! - So you noticed. - Karla! Whatever! I'm not used to it. Actually, I'm thinking of changing my name to Greta. What do you think? I suggested that! - Don’t you love it? - Yeah! It suits you! Iconic. Of course! The ultimate fantasy. Sex with an icon. Jake, the pretzels please. - Yeah. - And another bottle of wine. Oh my God! Finally! The late Fabellas! Hi! Long time! Oh, sorry! Traffic, as usual. Or were you just too lazy to get your asses out of bed? Hey, the honeymoon's only for a month! Don't look at me. It’s Ginny who can’t get enough. Right? - Hey! - I'm going out for a bit. Dude, what's up? I'm good. We ran out of beer. - I'll go get some. - What for? Ross brought vodka. That's not enough. You're the only beer drinker here. Fine! Hurry back! Guys! Hey! The gender breakers! Wow! And the cherry picker himself! Join us! Gin! Hey, looking good! You've put on some curves there. Thank you! So... Ara? Are you game? Huh? Threesome. - Come on, it's too early for that! - Threesome? Guys, are you talking dirty? Ah, not dirty enough because you’ll need some Shiva to your Shakti. I'm lost. Honey, the way you’re going, you’ll never be found! Shiva, male energy. Shakti, female energy. Yes, and they both need to be balanced. So might I suggest, a foursome! Count us in! Excuse me, Ross? My husband's not gay. I still prefer women. No facial hair. Come on, Karl! You're so passe. You're so old-fashioned. - Karla - Greta. Whatever. It's sexual liquidity nowadays. Sexual fluidity. - Same banana. - No, it's not. Whatever brings the marriage together, right? My goodness. Cheers! To sexual liquidity! Fluidity! Belle? Belle? Shhh. I hate him, Jake. I wish he would just disappear. You know what I mean. Belle, he's your father. So... What's going to happen to us, Jake? He wants to keep us apart. Why? Did you tell him about us? Did you tell him? No. I didn't, Jake. He said... he could smell it. What will happen to us? Jake. I can't bear to lose you. Jake. Caress me, Jake. Fondle me as if I'm the first woman you've ever touched. Get to know my entire body… As if you're exploring it for the first time… you've ever been here... "Think of me as an adventure… a place that you've only just discovered… without a map… mysterious... a landscape never before penetrated… Still virgin." "Search my body for its secrets… my hidden caves... my concealed hollows… "Come, enter my forest... bathe in the deepest stream of my soul's marrow and understand at last, what desire is..." I love you so much, Jake… I love you. I love you, Jake. I'm going. Coffee? I'm late. I'll see you later. “Thank God we're sexually compatible. We both enjoy long foreplay, tongue kisses… oral sex… he knows which part of my body is easily aroused... at last, I've found my soulmate... For the first time in my life, I find sex pleasurable Every night I pray that this relationship... will not be like the others… That this time, it will be forever..." Oh, hi. Am I disturbing you? No, no! Please come in! Sorry. It's my turn to apologize I had to rush some orders. Coffee? Tea? Anything? Beer. - Ah - If... you have any. Of course! Jake always stocks up. That was three years ago. You still look like newlyweds. Seriously? Three years is still the honeymoon period. Three years is already boring. I don't understand how a man can get bored with a gorgeous wife like you. You're so wrong, Arman. I mean, you don’t mind that I call you Arman, do you? I mean no disrespect… With your status and all… But somehow I feel comfortable talking with you. I get that all the time. My students even call me Father Confessor. Because you're a good listener. Maybe it's because I'm a writer and a teacher. Anyway, you were saying… Oh yeah... Don’t be fooled by me and Jake. We were about to split up when we decided to give our relationship one more try. So we left my parents' house. We thought that maybe, being on our own and living like a real married couple would revive our feelings for each other. And? I’m really trying my best. Sometimes, even when I don't feel like it, I would intiate sex which I would not usually do. So you don't really enjoy sex? Honestly? Not really. I don’t like it, but I feel guilty that I don’t. So I try harder. Doesn't your... husband make you happy in bed? Actually, I feel bad for Jake. He tries... or used to... But like I said, I'm bored with it. Don't worry. You're normal. I am? That's really how women are. This is how they’ve been wired to behave for hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution. Sorry, but... I don't get it. The cause of this sexual malaise is monogamy itself. Women don't normally feel aroused for their sexual partners. They get sexually bored... because they're only horny at some points in their lives. A man's sex drive is higher, that's why he rarely experiences sexual boredom. Men are always horny, that's why they prefer a woman who's at their beck and call… always available and willing. So are you saying monogamy doesn’t work? Monogamy sucks... and it creates all kinds of problems. As humans, we're not designed for it. "Are you insane? No way will I allow my partner to fuck someone else! So I'll settle for monogamy and just endure the boredom, the drama, the betrayal, the divorce, destroying my family, etcetera..." Sorry, sorry… So rude of me. Why did you drop by? Did you want to tell me something? I already did. Oh, hi Belle! How are you? Hey, our building is pretty small, yet we hardly see each other. Don't you go out much? There's really nowhere for me to go. Just to church. Why? Are you a loner? Don't have any friends? I'm not allowed. - By whom? - By Papa. My husband's underwear is so sorry-looking. Thinned out. See? Oh, sorry. Look. I haven't had time to go shopping. What's wrong? Have you never seen a man's briefs before? Oh my God! Are you still a virgin? You're wasting yourself, Belle. With your beauty, you deserve to have a man to make you happy or maybe you prefer a woman... Or a man and a woman... I'm looking for a woman for me and my husband. It might be you. It's simple. Jake and I will be doing you a favor and in return, you’ll be doing us a favor… It will be a secret among us three… "Aren't these lovers aware that they're trysting on hallowed ground amidst the souls of the cremated dead? And one day, their solemn vows of eternal love will also turn to ashes? On the other hand, doesn't their abominable screwing, add spice to their bittersweet, forbidden love?" Fucking hell, Jake! I'm sick of this! Myls, sorry. You know that my fucking work is all I can think about. What else is new? Well, then go fuck your stupid book! Stop it, Jake! So. Is this what you want? Okay, I'll give it to you. Jake, what the fuck are you doing?! - Wait. I'll give it to you. - Jake! I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. Is it this? - Is it this? - Jake! Huh? Is this what you want? Jake! Enough! - Is this what you want? - Please! Jake. Jake! Myls, are you happy now? Fuck you! - Happy now? - Get lost! All good? You're disgusting! Fuck you! Wait! Hi. Hey. - Belle. - Wait... Jake. He's not here. It's not that. Come on. What's wrong? The room is messy. Belle, that's what I like. I don't like mess, Jake. Why can't you... What is your problem? What's this? What's this? I'm on my period. I'm confused. Does your period come twice a month? My period is irregular. Didn't you know? I've been monitoring your cycle so I don't get you pregnant. Are you seeing other guys? Come here... Wait! Tell me. Stop it! What's that? What? Goddamit! Tell me! It's Papa's! He hurts me, Jake. He forces himself on me but I'm helpless. He's cruel. That's why I always bleed. Afterwards, he asks me to forgive him. Over and over, Jake. He won't stop. Since when? Since when? Since when? Since when? Since when? Ever since I was a little girl, after my mom died. Jake... Please don't go… Don't go. Don't leave me. He'll make it worse for me. Please! Jake! Please! I can't deal with this. I can't deal with this. Fuck! "Everyone has his own notions about love and death... Our whole life, we seek love and hide from death. "'Do we really have to talk about this?'' the woman asked in annoyance. 'There's nothing you can do about it anyway Love and death are out of your hands. The man persisted. He was wide awake. Isn't it a scary thought?" he asked. My heart leaps with anxiety But it also gives me a thrill… Just like bungee-jumping... You could either hit your head, or you could fly. Only one thing's certain in love or death, you never know what lies in wait… The woman stared at the man coldly. Belle. "Tell me the truth… Do you have a lover?" The best hour of the day when the world says “fuck, to hell with it” and decides to just shut down. Duck egg? Don't you like duck eggs? No. How about women? Because duck eggs and women, same banana. After you suck the juice out of them, and extract their essence, they're worthless. The beauty of it is... You'll never run out the supply is endless, a dime a dozen. Women aren't duck eggs. They aren't duck eggs. You're right. Sometimes, penoy. They're all dried up. Now, listen well, Jake… I'll give you some guidelines on novel writing First of all, you have to obsess over the topic, story, or the character you want to write about Second, get to know everything about them. Research, research, research... Third, It's the heart. The soul... The soul! This is the core of your writing. Here. It's where you'll draw inspiration from! Traversing the expanse of a landscape. Oh, what a glorious sunset! If we had never met, I would have killed myself a long time ago… When I'm in church, I always pray, for God to take Papa, so he will no longer hurt me. You know what, I was such a fool to admire your father. It was wrong... Have you ever had a wish come true? When I was a little girl, everything I wished for came true. When I desired something, it was granted. Everything I hoped for was fulfilled. So when I met you, I wished so hard, that you would love me too. Don't worry... I'll never leave you. I love you so much. Do you really love me, Jake? Yes. Prove it. From this day on, we'll never be separated from each other. Never. Where were you? Out working. As in the whole fucking day?! Yes! As in the whole fucking day. I've been calling you since last night, Jake. Texting you! You never replied! Because when I work, I do not fucking check my messages. - Bullshit! - Work is sacred! Work is sacred! You used to always text and call when we weren't together! What's going on with you?! You've changed! My, who... who the fuck walked out on me, huh? Who is she? What do you mean who? Your fucking mistress! My, what the fuck are you talking about? I don't know what you're fucking talking about, My. Fuck you, Jake! I know you're seeing someone! Tell me! Who is she?! Tell me! Who? My! You know what, You've got quite an imagination there. You should have been the writer. Don't you get it? I work! For us! - Damn you. - For us? - Yeah! - For yourself! Asshole! Fuck you! Bitch! Mylene. Hi, - May I join you? - Sure. Sure. How've you been? Where's Jake? Let me guess. He stayed up all night. That's how we writers are. We breathe, eat, drink, and shit words. Get used to it. Shit is correct. And Jake has been giving me a lot of it lately. Is there a problem? Jake is having an affair. How do you know? Just like you. I can smell it. What are you going to do? Kill them. Who? The woman, or Jake? The woman first. Then I'll cut Jake's balls off. And watch him slowly bleed to death. Do you want me to help you find out who she is? Please. Please. Please. I don't know what to do. I don't... I feel helpless. Hey, Jake! I'm glad you're here. I really wanted to talk to you. Jake's my guest. And I'm taking him to my room. Whatever we do in there is none of your business. I'm no longer afraid of you. And I told Jake everything. So from now on, I'll do what I want and you can't stop me. What the hell? That was brave of you! How'd you do that? What must he think about us? We can't do this! He has more to fear! I can ruin his reputation He can go to jail for what he's doing to me. So bring him to justice. He's still my father, Jake. How will I survive without him? Hey… You know that I'm here now. I'll take care of you. I can give up everything. I want you to be mine. I can do this because of you. For you. You mean it? I get my strength from you. Only from you. Wait, wait. Hold on! He's right outside. I feel nervous. I can't do this... I can't. Don't worry. He will no longer be a problem… Not ever… I’ll leave her already… I'll leave Mylene for you. When will you tell your wife? Soon. Soon, I promise. Fuck you, Jake! You motherfucker! Mylene! Mylene! Fuck! - I knew it! You're fucking that bitch! - Stop it! Stop it! You're fucking crazy! No! You're crazy! I know what you're capable of! Fucker! That Belle is a slut! Mylene... I'm sorry. Belle's not here. She left earlier. She goes to church on Mondays. Jake. Didn't you drop in to borrow some writing books? In your hurry, you forgot this. Thank you, sir. Jake. We talked for hours and... I'm still "Sir" to you? Arman... "That night, the woman came to see me tears streaming down her face asking to be forgiven for causing a scandal, apologizing for all the accusations that came out of her mouth. Baseless allegations. She claimed that she lost her mind, and forgot that she was a decent woman, driven insane with jealousy because she loved her husband so much. Ah, Love can send you to the edge of madness, you can get intoxicated by a person and the only antidote is alcohol. Alcohol, in order to forget, or to remember? There's no difference, drunkenness loosens the tongue and unlocks the heart. It's a tragedy that there are men who can't be happy with just one woman. It's confusing, even to a man like me. Why does this happen after a man marries the woman he had desired and dreamed of? What man will lose interest in the meal that's laid out for him when all he has to do is to partake of the feast? Mylene… Mylene… You're a book I'm yearning to read… Page by page. Why is she here? You know why. Send her home. Mylene! Fuck. Sir, I apologize. Jake, tell me something. It seems to me that you're sick and tired of these silky legs. Sumptuous thighs. And this desireable... Fuck you, Arman. Will you bury me alive in here? I'm burning down like a candle! Life is out there! Belle, have a bit more patience with Jake. I've had enough of him. I want... something new that I've never experienced food I haven't tasted not the same old, same old. I'm sick of it. I have a student... who grew up in America. So, what else is new? He's looking for a tutor. He wants to learn Filipino. How old? Younger. I'll teach him how to play "rock paper scissors"! Belle, Give me one more week to finish the novel. You're not finishing that. I am. But of course, my dear! You'll end it. Bring that to the pawnshop tomorrow. The down payment for the book is all spent. - You want it? - Give it! Then get it. Look at him. Just look at him, Belle. He's so arrogant! Just because he's done with his novel? And here I am. With nothing. Didn't meet my deadline. Fuck him, Belle. Fuck him! Thank you, Jake. Fix your shirt. The other writers might recognize you. That's the book he signed for you, right? Are you okay? - Let's go. - Yeah. I'm really sorry for your loss. What's the matter? - Are you okay? - Yeah. Sure? I just need to go to the bathroom. Okay. Belle! Belle! Belle! Jake, What's wrong? Belle? Belle… Belle! I'm having a hard time. Jake, you barely have two weeks for your novel, okay? - I understand. - It still needs editing!
