Is that what you're saying? What is the point of owning a house if you don't have anyone to live with? So, Mom, I'm gonna marry a burger-loving, pale American man and share my home with him. Hey, here we go again. Well, find me a burger-loving Ethiopian man. Your father was a great man. They don't make men like that anymore.

Kiss me! Mom, I grew up with him! He's like my brother, and he saw me pee in my pants when I was five, no. You know, he works with his hand. He's a surgeon. Oh, no, yuck, that is not right, no!

When Abell and I were in college, he used to irritate the hell out of me, 'cause it seemed like he had this fascination with hammering nails in the most random places to hang his pants. So of course, I'd wake up and hit my head on those things every morning. When he moved out, he took all his nails with him. This morning, I woke up having the urge to start filling all the holes back with nails. Then I realized I wouldn't have anyone to blame for my clumsiness. Your brother, he didn't mind taking the blame for other people's faults. If you ever need someone, call me. Thank you, Yohance.

She had to go and see a doctor, she was hurt by you. I should apologize for him, but I've never been very good at apologies. I'm the dad, I'm Logan. Think your mom let me in. ELENIE: Oh, yeah, sorry about that, my mother is helping me out today. Come on in, I'm Elenie Tariku. Hey, Logan Thompson. Nice to meet you. Charley, I need to speak to your father privately. Do you mind waiting in the hallway? He's gonna tell me what you say anyways. Wipe that tone of voice off your face, bud. Come on, come on. I don't know what's been going on with him these last few months. ELENIE: Oh, he'll be fine. You know, when kids move to a new school, a new environment, they tend to act out. LOGAN: My wife and I are from here. We actually went to the same school, good old Larsen Hill, except I was the one beatin' up on kids. So where did you move from? Troy, Michigan. My wife got this great job opportunity at (MUMBLING), and I got laid off. Mr. Thompson, it is your right to refuse counseling, but considering this is Charley's second outburst, if he continues this way, the school will expel him. You can call me Logan. Your eyes are so expressive. It's because they're big, isn't it? (LAUGHING) No, they're beautiful. Isn't it funny the things you were teased for as a child, you always get complimented on as an adult, right? Where are you from? I mean, if you don't mind me asking. I'm from Ethiopia, do you know where that is? Of course you do, I'm sorry. If I'm not mistaken, it's the birthplace of coffee? Wow, I'm impressed. You know, most people would jump straight to the famine we had back in the '80s. I got some good jokes. No, I'm totally... I'm kidding, that's ridiculous. Anyways, I recommend Charley and I meet twice a week. LOGAN: Doctor knows best. ELENIE: I'm not a doctor, I'm just a counselor. Six seconds, (MUMBLING) you ready for this? He dribbles, he dribbles, six, five, dribbling really quietly because the neighbors are asleep. All right, oh, he's makin' some fancy moves! All right. Two, one. (IMITATING CROWD CHEERING) Yes, and the crowd goes wild! Yes! So Kobe, how do you feel about talkin' to a counselor? It's whatever. So are we gonna talk about this? Well, I was looking forward to having a long conversation... Being serious, buddy. You know, you don't have to tell her everything. You just want to be careful, you know, for me, for you, for us. I know. Cool. Oh, I forgot something. What? This. No! Put me down! No, no, put me down! He's a winner! No! He's a winner! WALLACE: Mila, Mila Thompson. (WALLY LAUGHING) Wally? What are you doing here? I transferred. Wally, I can't breathe. You moved back without calling me? I know, we just moved back last month. You look as good as the day we graduated high school! Well, on that day, I was six months pregnant. Wally, how are you? Oh, you know, I'm good, fine, perfect. Unemployed, per usual, and always looking for a story. You know, I sent cover letters and articles, but people must use it to wipe their ass 'cause I don't get so much as a you suck. On top of which, Mom left, so now I'm raising my sister with Dad. Sorry. Oh, it's fine. Life is what it is. What are you doing here? Oh, I'm just visiting my sister, Maddie. MILA: Why? Oh, you know, the school said Charley Thompson, and I just didn't put it together. Charley, my Charley? Yes, he was involved in an altercation with Maddie, some schoolyard tantrum, you pick on me, I pick on you thing. I'm sorry, I had no idea. Doctor said she'll be okay, she'll be out in no time. How have you been here a month and not called me? My mom got really sick. And actually, she died. Geez. I'm sorry. It's fine. I haven't really been talking to anyone about it. I don't know what to say, really. We moved back so Logan could fix her house before we sold it. He's still doing construction. Cool. It's hell. Wally, I wish I was back in high school. You're sweet. Logan, didn't tell me anything happened with Charley at school. Well, maybe he didn't know. Yeah, likely story. They cover for each other. (LAUGHING) (WATER RUNNING) Thank you, Lenie, but not tonight. (WATER RUNNING) (MAN CHATTERING ON TV) Really? (MAN CHATTERING ON TV) (GROANING SOFTLY) CHARLEY: No, no, no, stop, stop, stop!

(MAN CHATTERING OVER TV) (SIGHING DEEPLY) (LOUD POUNDING) I said I'm doing it. What? What are you... Love you, babe. (WATER RUNNING) (MIRROR SQUEAKING) Shave if you're gonna do that. Were you planning on telling me about what happened with Charley at school? I was waiting until you were relaxed, which is what I'm in here trying to do. (MUMBLING) Oh, Mrs. Thompson, you have, quite possibly, the very best knees of anyone I've ever seen. Logan, you haven't put me in the mood to come home to this. You're Charley's dad, it's a school night. What kind of rules are you settin' for our son? Yeah, I'm not perfect, established that when I flunked algebra. And just to be exact, it's been three weeks, four days, five hours. What? Since what? Since the sausage went in the biscuit. Charley was playing with your phone again. LOGAN: Huh? I said Charley was playing games on your phone again, and now, your phone is cracked. Oh. Since the ham went in the sandwich. Dammit, Logan, have you fixed anything in this house? Yeah, you know what, I've been painting the walls in every room. But if you want, why don't you give me a prioritized list, you can sign off on it at the end of every night. How does that sound? (WATER RUNNING) I wish you and me got married, 'cause you and I know how to have a civilized conversation without it ending in someone saying something retarded. Well, you know, I'm still available. Get off the phone, you're keeping your sister up. Slamming my door's helping! (MILA LAUGHING) (GROANING) I have to move out, I'm too old for this shit! (LAUGHING) I know, you're so pathetic. You should move in with us, but I actually don't think living here can be any better. The school called about Charley's behavior again today. Charley knows we've been fighting. I'm sorry, that sucks. Wally, I miss our moms. It's awful living here. Death is so shitty. I hear ya, death is lame.

These are just clothes, Ma! Come on. Believe me, Abell and Pa would be more upset to see you wearing these clothes than out of them. You have to do it for them. Okay? Fine. But this is our deal. Okay, our deal. Beyonce's tits. Excuse you, Charley, we're not talking about Beyonce here, so you're gonna have to think of something else besides a celebrity, okay? Your mom. Charley, you are out of line, you need to apologize. (TOY CLATTERING) Is he gonna be okay? Ask him yourself. You're the freakin' therapist! Charley!

Women don't wear dresses anymore. I guess a dress makes you feel like a lady, right? Totally. (BOTH LAUGHING) What if I dared you to wear jeans? Course I do, it's all I used to do when I was a kid. I was a tomboy, you know? Really? Yeah. I would have never ever guessed that. ELENIE: Yeah, I was. Like, tomboy like you used to play sports? Of course. I was in every team you can think of at school. You look so uncoordinated. Oh, my God! (BOTH LAUGHING) (SOFT ENERGETIC MUSIC) Turn left here. Why'd you point right, though? Oh, sorry, I'm dyslexic, you know? Oh, that makes sense. (SOFT ENERGETIC MUSIC) You know, I have the same problem with my mom's ring that she gave me, it's a little too big. Yeah, I got mine when I was 17. Fingers were all ballooned up from taking too many steroids. Wow, that sounds unhealthy to me. The marriage or the steroids? ELENIE: Why so young? You remember that 11-year-old in your office? He pretty much sealed the deal. I don't know, it's hard, but it's good. ELENIE: It's right over here. Really, you live right here? Yeah. LOGAN: That's crazy, I live right around the corner. ELENIE: What a small world! I mean, it's Brooklyn. Nice digs. Thank you, but it's kinda too big for the two of us, you know? It's just the two of you? I just recently moved back home with my mom. (PHONE RINGING) (PHONE VIBRATING) ABELL: You've reached Doctor Abell Tariku. I can't come to the phone right now. My God!

I don't know, I could use some advice, I guess. So are you and your wife ready to start family therapy, or? I think his teacher's overreacting, I mean, don't you? I mean, come on, Charley's not, you know, he's not a bad kid. Then you should give it some time. Time will tell, things will change. I just want him to be happy, you know? Sure. (LAUGHING) Are you all right? I'm just hungry. (LAUGHING) Me too. Oh, here comes our food, cool. Oh, wow! It's colorful. Enjoy. Thanks. She forgot the forks.

Cactus. (PENSIVE MUSIC) (WOMEN SINGING AND CLAPPING IN UNISON) (MEN VOCALIZING) (WOMEN TRILLING) (TENSE PENSIVE MUSIC) (TRAIN RUMBLING ON TRACK) Say something so I know it's not true. I didn't know what else to do. No, no! (TENSE MUSIC) No, no, Logan, no! No! (SOBBING) (TENSE PENSIVE MUSIC) (HEART BEATING LOUDLY) (TRAIN CLACKING ALONG TRACK) (MILA SOBBING) (CHILDREN SCREAMING IN EXCITEMENT) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) (TRAIN SCREECHING) (TRAIN RUMBLING ALONG TRACK) (CHILDREN CHATTERING) (TRAIN RUMBLING ALONG TRACK) (PENSIVE MUSIC) (TRAIN CLACKING ALONG TRACK) I appreciate you coming. I understand that you don't want to press charges. I just want to say that I'm very sorry. It was an accident. You are Charley's father? Lenie? Lenie. What? Oh, I see. Oh, dear Jesus. I want to choose my words carefully before I speak. If we don't say the words out loud, it will harm us. I want to know what happened before I decide how I feel. Charley, when somebody drops their phone, you give it back to 'em, it's called not being rude. That's okay, he could play with it, I don't mind. CHARLEY: Say hi. Are you recording this? CHARLEY: Yeah, you're in my movie now. Say hi. I'm really sorry about him. That's all right. I'm Logan. ABELL: Abell, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. CHARLEY: No, no, no, say that to the camera. Hi, I'm Abell. Let's go! I'm Dad. (CAR HORN HONKING) (MUMBLING) CHARLEY: Dad? Look behind you, there's, Dad! (MEN GROANING) No, Dad, no! Dad, no! Run, Charley! CHARLEY: Oh, God! LOGAN: Charley, please get up. (SOBBING) (TRAIN HORN HONKING) (MAN SCREAMING) My God! Run! Run! CHARLEY: Oh, my God, no! What did you do? LOGAN: It was an accident, Charley, run, run! Don't look back! I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I didn't know that he was your brother, I swear. Doesn't matter! Lenie... No! No! Stop, Ma. Please, I'm sorry. I didn't want them to take Charley away. I've been holdin' on to this. (SAMARA SOBBING) It's killing me. It's destroying everything, my family... Your family? You've destroyed my family! You don't deserve to look at my mother in the face. (SAMARA SOBBING) (MYSTERIOUS PENSIVE MUSIC) (PANTING) (WINE SPLASHING IN SINK) Yes, I would like to cancel a service, please. (MYSTERIOUS PENSIVE MUSIC) MILA: We'll find something nearby. What about Dad? He'll be nearby. Promise. Okay. (MYSTERIOUS PENSIVE MUSIC) Do you want some breakfast? No. I can't get another thing in my stomach. (SNORTING PLAYFULLY) I'm so ashamed, Ma, and I'm disgusted in how much I embarrassed you. I'm sorry, so sorry. I'm really sorry, I hate myself for it. Don't hate yourself. You don't embarrass me. You make me proud every day. I'm the one that is sorry. You're stronger than me. I don't understand how you could forgive him, or me, for that matter. When they killed your father, I was so angry. The rage burned me inside, and I let it. For the last 25 years, it prevented me from doing anything. All I had was you and Abell. And if you don't turn out the way I planned, I told to myself, I'm a failure again. I don't know how to say it in English. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) A whispering guilt, a voice that keeps tugging at you. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) It haunted me. It's with me when I'm awake, when I sleep, all the time. You know what it says to me? No. You must be at peace. Find peace, choose peace. I have not been listening to that voice for many years. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) I don't want to hold you responsible for my joy. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Like I did with your father, sweet love. I want to walk down the streets wearing beautiful dresses and feeling attractive, the way I felt with your dad. I'm serious. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) I'm serious! (LAUGHING AND SNIFFLING) I hope you'll forgive me.
