(dramatic music) (creatures chirping) (footsteps thudding) (creature growling) (gun banging) - You must have government. And the history of the human race has demonstrated, needing it or not, we are prone to have some. What you must do is guard that it does not impinge upon these rights which pre-date it. The villain is not your next door neighbor, it's the authority in your town. (dramatic music) - Check. - Call. - How about you, cowboy? * Where the soil's just so right * (indistinct singing) - Fucking fold, son of a bitch. - I remember you. Didn't we meet at that place near Winstar? The one with all the naked paintings on the wall and shit? - Roosevelt's. - Roosevelt's, that's it. Sam, a little surprised to see you back at it after that blood bath. - Yeah, well. - You look different though. You had less hair back then and it was real short, you know, like a cop. - Are we here to play cards or just talk like a bunch of fucking schoolgirls? You know, I can always go home and watch the Rangers lose. - Playing with an Indian? - That's right. That is one Comanche I would not want to be chasing down. - I've got to make a phone call, boys. Good luck. - That's an outrage. The libertarians don't support communication and Thomas Jefferson. Now see, it's one of those things if you say it fast enough, it makes a great deal of sense. And since reporters are usually lazy (phone ringing) and will take the spoon feeding, which is given them, particularly when the individual doing the feeding. He just said, oh, that's right. Printed it as if it were gospel truth. - Hello. - And went on about the business. Neither of the reporters- - Stay off your phone. I'm on my way. And never read Jefferson on public education. (intense music) - Thanks for coming. - What I tell you about talking on the telephone? I spoke to the Indian. He said you're still going to be short. - How short? - 30 plus the points. That will be an extra 6. - $36,000? - What did you think it was going to be? - I don't know. God damn it. Something less than that. Fucking 30, 20. - It's not. - How much time do I got? - God dang it, man. Are you seriously asking me that right now? Suck it up, dude, and be a man. Pay your debt. It's that simple. - I can get you 10 by Friday. - Jessup, 10 looks bad, OK? 10 is, 10 is way too low. Are you back at the tables? Please tell me you're not back at the tables. - You think I need that heat right now, all right? I'm not back at the fucking tables. Now listen, I called you because I got something. I got something big. I wrote some things down. Think you can help me get my hands on that shit? - Jesus Christ, man. Who are you going to war with now? - It's just a precaution. But you gotta give me a week to get my ducks in a row. Then I'll get the money. I'll get you all of it. - Jessup, you know better than anybody, that's not how the Indian works, OK? Once your name goes down in that book, it stays in it forever. - Can you do this or not? - Three hours. I'll meet you behind the apartment. - All right. See you then. - Stay off your phone. (dramatic music) - Ricky. - Mitchell. What are you, what are you doing here? - I came to see an old friend. - Hey, I'm done with all that. I haven't placed a bet in over six months. I work behind a desk now. My family- - Would you like me to come back when you leave for your family? - What do you want from me? - Take it. Read it. - I can't do that. - You will do it. Or I will come back and burn this motherfucker down. Do you understand me? Nice. This one's a little bit more compact. But you know what, I don't need to be getting in your business. I just, I need to make sure this isn't going to come back at me. - It won't. - Yeah, but how do I know that for sure? - Ricky, it's not my first rodeo. You know, hold on. This is for your trouble, OK? Oh, hold on one second. I have one question for you. Look at me. Are you OK with getting up every single morning, jumping in this little family minivan, driving your happy ass to work and sitting behind a desk? Because to me, that's not you. - It pays the bills so- - Pays the bills. Where's that other voice that I'm used to? - Man, it pays the fucking bills. What do you think? (chuckling) - That's it. That's the one. That one looks good on you, Ricky. You need to keep that one. That's the one. I'd go to war with you with that face on. - Nice. - It's not a charity, man. This stuff cost me just over two bets. - $1,000? - Yep. Everything in here, nothing is traceable. What? You don't have that kind of cash? - Lying around, no. - Then we got to get on top of the points. That or you can let me in on your big play. Your choice. - Big enough to buy my way out of this shit. Both of us if it's done right. Got a guy that can get us in. Snatch and grab, simple. Why doesn't this guy cash it in himself? He's not that kind of guy. Jessup, man, what kind of guy are we talking about? Guys like us. I'm listening. I said I'm listening. Let's take a ride. You're driving. Don't smoke in my car. (water splashing) (dramatic music) What's wrong? Just give me a second. I thought you said the key was safe, man. It is. God damn it. All good? Yeah, we're in. I've got to get the power. Which room are we going to, man? Upstairs, last room on the left. (dramatic music) Are you sure there's no one else here? Not for another week. This girl takes 14 days. OK. Take this downstairs and wait for me there. Wait, how are you going to handle this? You got her cell phone OK. There's no landline from what I can tell. She can't call the cops. 30 minutes is all you said you need, yeah? Theoretically yes. What if she's got a fucking weapon in there, a fucking gun or something. Damn it, murder was not part of the plan. It was just kidnapping, man. Will you lower your fucking voice. Jesus Christ, you can kidnap somebody in their own house. Grandfather's house. Yeah, I know that. Same difference, man. It's only breaking and entering unless we take her somewhere. Go downstairs. Wait for me there. We find that walk away cash. We gotta get the fuck out of here. Good? Hey, what did I say about talking on the phone? No password. Who does that? What? She's a mute. She's a what? Oh God, man. She doesn't talk, Jessup. You're messing with me. Man, if you box me in on this, so help me God, man. The money is here. The money is here. We just have to get her to tell us, that's all, all right? Do what you do best. Scare the shit out of her. She better tell us. Lilly Waltman, is there a reason you won't answer my partner's questions? Man, this is pointless. Now if I gave you something to write with, could you write it down for me? Now the only way no one's going to get hurt is that if you cooperate, do you understand? What did she say? The police are coming. I suggest you leave. Let's try this again. I want you to write down the exact location of your grandfather's money. Write. What did she say? Oh, we intend to. We just don't know where it is. But I have it on good authority that you do. Is there a safe? Anything. All you have to do is us in the right direction and we disappear like that. Oh, I got that one. Did you get that one? Yeah, real funny. Tie her back up. Give me your hand. Put it there. You got 45 minutes to jog your memory or else your night gets a hell of a lot worse. Otherwise, I'm going to come in and shoot you in the face. I'm done with this girl. God, in there. He's alive. What happens now? We make her tell us where it is. And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful, OK? She can never get out of this house. As a matter of fact, she can never think she's getting out of this house. Are we going to kill her? No, not just yet. We'll give her the 45 to clear her head. And if she ain't playing ball still, we move her ass to the barn. Barn? We know he's out there right now. Way more motivation at the barn. I don't think it's a good idea to bring her in here, man. Well, what do you suggest? We leave? How does that play out when the Indian gets here? No one has to die, Mitchell. Nobody is going to die. Please have the balls to follow through with this, man. Think about it. If you were her right now, how long could you play the stupid game she's playing? Fucking pathetic, man. We press her ass until she cracks. Let me have it. It's leverage, let me have it. It's been 45 minutes. Good, go get her. I'll wait down here. What is this? What is this? You called it in? You're gonna tell me where it is. Do you understand me? God damn you. Do you understand what's going to happen to you? Do you have any idea what he's going to do to you down there? Please, please, please, please. Please, you fucking idiot. Hello. Seems a little unnecessary you not being about talk and all. I was curious though, can a mute girl scream? Hm? What do you think? You think she can scream? I can't stand these uncomfortable silences. Lilly. Your grandfather was a financial backer of a group of marijuana smugglers who operated in the United States in the 1970s. He owned a small fleet of shrimping boats out of Port Arthur. Now each week he'd commission round trips from South Texas to Columbia. Rumor has it they brought in over 106 tons of marijuana in just two years. They call themselves the cowboy mafia. But when one of the boats was seized, your grandfather was convicted on 10 counts of racketeering and interstate commerce violations. But he was a Texas Ranger, did you know that? So he only did five years and he got out clean. He died three days ago. The feds claimed what they could from the ranch. Now Lilly, I know you don't own six ranches, a welding supply company, oil and gas holdings, without having a healthy stash of ransom money hidden somewhere safe. This is where you come in. You either tell me where he hid the money or I'm going to drill a fucking hole through your bone into the other side of this god damn chair. You got me? Can you hear me now? Huh? We spoke to your brother. He says you know the exact location. Are you ready to talk? Here you go. Write that shit down. You've got five seconds. Start writing. 5, 4, 3, 2- That a girl. That wasn't so bad. I don't understand. Which part? That this job was total bullshit or you had bad intel? Hey, my information was good. Her brother is dead. You're talking to the wrong guy. Look, man, I like you, I always have. And I agreed to come in on this. But 50% of nothing, man, is nothing. How is this going to look when the Indian gets here and sees me knee deep in this bullshit? It's not going to be good. You clean this mess up yourself, all right? The guns and supplies are on the house. You're right. It wasn't your idea, it was mine. My debt. My idea to take her hostage. But it was also my idea to take a boy I trusted, a brother to set us up for life. Guess that all is bullshit, the money, the fucking books, the fucking Indian. I can own that. But what I cannot walk away from is knowing there's a fortune out here on this land, $80 million. Think about it. All right. What was his name, this so-called brother? He goes by Brady. He's a squirrelly looking fucker who works at the security firm that got us in the front door. There's no Brady in here, man. I mean, why would he lie? I don't know. Look, she doesn't tell us where it is by the time I get back, I'm going to bury a slug in her ear, OK? Where the fuck you going? Handle it. I'll be back. When I was a kid, my family used to make these trips down the shore. There was this bridge along the way. And you always knew you got close because the air would change. I would start smelling the salt. Anyway, my father, he'd always drive and he'd make us listen in this '80s radio station of his. And we all hated it as kids growing up. Well, now I like it. There was this song, "Don't Know What You Got Till It's Gone" by Cinderella. Have your heard of it? I didn't think so. When I sit here and I look at you, and I just think about the words to that song. Don't know what you got till it's gone. Don't know what it is I did so wrong. Kind of sounds like you and I, doesn't it? You losing your voice. And me just being the way I am. Tonight is not going to go very well for you if you don't tell me where that money is, do you understand me? Now write it down. This is not true. You heard my partner said. Did you not hear him? Walk away money buried somewhere out here. And your grandfather was not the type of person to put it in the bank. I mean, if you don't know where it is like you say you don't, then he must have left a will, correct? Correct? Write it. Tell me where it is. Write. Now I'm sorry about this. I didn't want to hurt you. If that money is found and that will is where you say it is, then you'll be free as a bird by tomorrow, all right? You changed your hair. I wonder why. I was looking over this will. There's not much of a family left, is there? Who is Giordana? His coke dealing whore mistress. That's lovely. Does she know anything? What about your mother? Did you ever talk about your grandfather's money with her? Did she never mention anything? Do you ever talk to your mother about anything, good point. So that's it then. One of Texas's wealthiest drug smugglers dies. The state takes most of his assets, the ones they know about. And the granddaughter and the mistress get the rest. Any chance the old man buried the money on the property? Think, property lines, maps of the ranch. You know he's keeping this shit somewhere safe. What about his office? Are they there? Lithium pills. You're bipolar. My sister used to take the same ones. (dramatic music) Fuck. Did you find him? In the trunk. Wait. Did she talk yet? There's a will. There was nothing in it about money. You're going to search on foot, it's over 500 acres, man. Well, you got a better fucking idea? It's safe to say your buddy here isn't related to the strong silent type in the barn. Oh yeah, the Indian called. He's turned the hourglass over on this thing, man. He's going to be here in less than 24 hours. I'm sorry. You told him? Yeah. I intend on living past tonight. (gun banging) Put it down. No way, man. You first. Think about it. If I wanted you dead, you never would have gotten the shot off. Put it down. You have trouble finding that thing? It was where you said it was going to be at, under the spare. It looks like he roughed you up a little. Yeah, roughed me up a little bit more than what you said he would. Well, you were supposed to go willingly. Didn't you get my text? What did I say about being on the phone, man? Yeah. Yeah, drives like a maniac too. Yeah, I know. What are we going to do with the body? We'll strip him down, put him in the trunk, and bury the rest. What about his ride? We'll get rid of it after we're done like nothing ever happened. All right. Did you find the money? No. You didn't tell me the girl was a mute. What, she couldn't hear? She can't talk, asshole. How the hell was I supposed to know that? I'm a security guy. Just shut the fuck up and help get him in the trunk. All right, then we'll pull the car around front. How are doing to do that? Come on, man. I need your fucking help. Look how big he is, God damn it. I know. One, two. OK. Is it just me or you think a big guy like that would have a bigger nut sack, huh? What the fuck is wrong with you? Huh, just saying. Are you done? Yeah. That too. Anything else? Oh, the girls phone. Oh yeah? Check for nudes. In the fucking hole. Hey man, she's hot. Shut up. You need to lighten up. Have you ever fuck a midget before? Shut up. It's fucking crazy. What? We need to talk about how we're going to fix this. I did my job, pal. I got you in here, right? Yeah. Thanks a lot, Brady. I really appreciate it. But nothing's worked out the way you planned it. Don't you get that? Hey, if you mind, I'm going do wipe my ass. Are you going to stare at me? Oh my gosh. I thought you said she can write, had to tell you that way. She doesn't know where the money is. Oh, that's bullshit, man. She's lying. It's not that easy to make $80 million disappear like that. I know that. It's a lot of fucking money. Damn straight it is. And we're going to split it 50/50, like you said, right? I mean, that's what you said. You said I get you in the house, we take out the redneck, and we split the dough. - I know what I said. - Am I right? I know what I said. OK, I'm not arguing with you about that. But half of no money is nothing, Brady. Where the hell is she now? God, you stink so bad. I feel a lot better though, I'll tell you that. (dramatic music) Hey, hey, should we wear a mask? She's blindfolded and she's scared shitless. What are we going to do to her? I've walked every square inch of this property. I don't have a clue where to start. All I know is we got 24 hours. So we've got to get her to talk. What's happening in 24 hours? You don't want to know. Yeah, I do. I want to know what's happening in 24 hours. That guy you buried, the man that he works for isn't going to care about money we don't have. He'll kill us both. Both? Wait a minute, pal, this your gig. I'm just helping you out. In and out, you know. 50/50 right? Right. Shit. What? She's fucking bleeding, that's what. OK, so? She wasn't bleeding when I left. OK. I found the property deeds and the maps in your grandfather's office. And I took one long walk around this fucking place. And I'm no closer to finding what I came here for. Now there's a new player on board. And he's going to be here real soon. He's not going to care about what happened here. He's not going to care about the money or any of that other shit. He's here to take my blood. And he's not going to leave any witnesses. Do you understand me? So now it's time to stop pretending and do the only thing that's going to save your life, the only thing that's going to save our lives. Yes, damn straight. And that's to tell me where that fucking money is. Do you understand me? Untie her right hand. Get her the pen. Hm? What? Wait. She stabbed me. Is it bad? Jesus Christ. Oh my God. Sorry, brother. (gun banging) You. You. You are going to tell me where that money is. Do you understand me? Do you understand me? Do you understand? You're going to write it. Take this fucking pen and put it to the paper and you write it down now. Or I swear to God, the next one's to be in your fucking head. Copper Bill? What is that? No, no, you tell me what it is. You tell me where it is. You tell me now. Do you understand me? Three, two, fucking pen. We both know this isn't a horse stable, but I'm believing you. So what I want you to do with your head, I want you to show me where they stalled Copper Bill. Show me where they kept that damn horse. Yeah? You're sure? Damn it. Damn it. Asshole. Ugh. Son of a bitch. God damn it. God damn it. Mother fucker. Fuck. Are you fucking with me, girl? Fuck. Oh God. Let's take you and get you cleaned up. But you've seen my face. That changes things. We've got to go get rid of that body in the barn. Come on. (dramatic music) (footsteps thudding) (intense dramatic music) (music ends) When me and my sister were kids, we used to always dream about growing up in a place like this. We were broke as shit. We couldn't have been more apart even though we were twins. By the time I was getting out of rehab the first time, she was already a year out of law school. That's when I got the call sheet on her cell. Should have been me, I guess. For her to do something, to do something like that, and to think all these things about me right here to your doorstep, looking for your grandfather's money. Shit. I don't know why I'm telling you all this, I'm just tired. But I don't want to see you get hurt. If I can get us out of this, can you promise not to jam me up on the other end? Good. He's here. Ah! Don't you move. Don't you move. Do you want to live through this? Do you want to live through this? Because he's going to kill us both. So you do exactly as I say. Sh. Walk, walk. Good afternoon, ma'am. I was driving past looking for the driver of that car. A friend of mine who drives that same make and model has gone missing. I was wondering if you can help me find him. Ma'am? You don't speak? And the car? Sorry to bother you. Thank you. If you change your mind about seeing our friend, I won't be far. Pack a bag right now. Move. Hurry, move. Where are you? We don't have much time. All right, that's enough. Come on, move. Stay right here, OK? When I say three, you run to that car and you don't stop until you get to that charger. Do you understand me? Do you understand? All right, ready, 1, 2, 3, go. Move, move, move. Move, move, go, go. Move. What are you doing? If you stay here, he's going to kill you. I'm leaving in 3, 2- Come on, piece of shit. Gun out. Slowly. Girl out. Walk slowly to the front of the car. Stop, on your knees. Cross them. Hands above your head and keep them there. Now you. You have some explaining to do. I can get your money, man. I know where the money is, man. Hey. Hey. Can you move? Yeah. Don't become. (speaking in foreign language) We can't fucking understand you. I can help you with that. Looks like I missed out on a little bit of fun. Mitchell. What he said was he wouldn't mind killing you. Nobody want to see somebody so pretty get split in half, especially me. But that's just a loose translation, of course. Who the fuck is Mr. Rogers here? There are no more innocent people left on this earth, just different levels of responsibilities. Take our Indian friend here, he works for me now. What? Mitchell didn't tell you about that? That old kook. He thought just because I drive a minivan that I forgot where I left my ball sack. I don't have your money, man. I don't have your money. 30 grand, I lost it. You fucking gambled with our money? Half of it. I thought I could win it back and I fucked up. Mitchell said you shot the cash. It's all gone, chief. So you just killed him? I had to have him help me pull the job off. There's money out here hidden on this ranch. Cowboy mafia legend, it's true. Mitchell came in on it with me. And this one, she can't talk so we don't know where the goddamn money is. And here we are. Well, I am a business man. So how much are we talking about here? 80 million cash. And you don't really know where it is, do you? She's fucking lying, boss. With the cutting horse, goes by Copper Bill. The money is supposedly buried with it. You find that horse, you find that money. Cutting horse. I remember overhearing a story this foreigner was telling in Vegas. This foreigner was talking about taking cutting horses and packing their asses full of drugs and shipping them up from South America. And when they get here, they cut out their anus to make it easier to pull the drugs out. He said it was messy and a lot of animals bled out. Fuck me running, that gives me a great idea. Give me that knife. (metal clanging) Ugh, motherfucker. You tell me where the money is right now or I'm going to slice this fucker's asshole open right in front of you. Don't tell him anything, God damn it. If we kill him, there's no need for you anymore. Don't trust him. He'll kill you anyway. You shut the fuck up. You got a serious decision to make. So what's it going to be? The money or his blood? The pad. Give her the fucking pad. She'll write it down. God damn it. Fuck. Damn bonds. Fucking asshole. (intense music) Like I said, I'm a business man. Here, find that. And dispose of him quickly. All right, I've got to go. Movie night tonight. Here it is. You have an hour. Are you sure about this? I said dig. Fucker. It's all fucking rock. Fucking stones. You don't fucking get it. Fuck this. Fuck it. Fuck you. I'm not doing it, chief. You're going to have to shoot me. Dig. You motherfucker. You Indians never understood a cowboy. What the hell is that? Who else is here? No one. It's just us three. He's lying. I honestly wasn't expecting the cell phone to go off. I assume you buried it with your friend's body? You can talk. One sec, was that a question? What the fuck? Yeah, OK, not being able to talk and not talking are two very different things. You see, you and your friend just didn't push hard enough is all. Pick up the shovel, keep digging. I wasn't lying about the money. He didn't bury it all there. There's enough underneath your feet to make anyone comfortable for the rest of their God given natural lives. So that's your plan, have me help you find the money. Dig it up and then what? You shoot me? Yeah. It's kind of convenient you're digging a hole, isn't it? I don't understand. People died here. When I was 7, I fell off my grandfather's favorite horse, Copper Bill. I only lost partial hearing. But I was able to convince my family that the accident affected me enough to turn me mute. I spent all my summers here, learning sign language, learning how, how, learning how not to speak. Most importantly, I learned to be alone. I'm more alone than someone like you could ever imagine. Why? My grandfather kept secrets. You see, he never trusted anyone who liked to talk, because he always thought they were the weakest. So I stayed quiet. He'd tell me things he'd never tell another soul. Because he assumed I couldn't speak, so who would I tell? And that's how I learned about the money, money the feds couldn't even find, money that was stashed away with the horse that changed my life. Changed your life? Never speaking to another person for 18 years. When I was young, I remember how people would act towards me. Some assume you're stupid, you're just doing it for attention. But this was a choice. It cost you your life. It cost me everything. It cost me my family. It cost me a shot at a normal fucking life until today. Was it worth it? What do you think? Look around you. Look at what it made you give. You know what? You're a free man right now. I've done you a favor you couldn't possibly repay. How about showing a little gratitude? Gratitude? I had to kill two men to get here. Who's free of that? You put that on yourself by coming here. It's not my problem. So keep digging. No. Do it, or I'll shoot you. No. You want the money? Dig the hole yourself. Fine. (gun banging) (gurgling) (body thumping) (water splashing) (dramatic music) How much did you get? Enough. That's my girl. Your chariot awaits. * Where the soil is west side story * * Where the soil is just all right * * Where the soil is west side story * * Where the soil is just all right * * Amen (soft harmonica music) * It's just all right * Just all right * Where the soil is west side story * * Where the soil is just all right * * Where the soil is west side story * * Where the soil is just all right, all right * * Just all right * Just all right * Where the soil is just all right * * Where the soil is just all right *
