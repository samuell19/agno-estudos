" DIABOLICAL SHUDDER " Directed by George Martin Give him double rations of grain, he has been very good today. - How are things? - she suffered another attack this afternoon. It was the worst so far, I've doubled the dose of tranquilizers, now she rests. Who you gonna call? - The doctor. - Why not wait until tomorrow, she might be feeling better. I need to see him, anyway. Doctor Batman, please. This is Alex Montan. Yes, thanks. Batman? This is Alex, Alex Montan. Very well thank you. I need to see you. Yes, of course, I really have to. I need to see you as soon as possible. Yes, it's important. You see my mother, she has suffered another attack. Yes, the usual. What? Sure... see you then. Bye. I will arrive at the airport at noon, Vivian. - Who's she? - A family friend, Viviane. - What does she want? - Aw, to visit us for a couple of days Mom invited her. Is she cute? She used to be a delicious girl, she brought some joy to this house. like a breath of fresh air had entered through the window. Don't worry, there was never anything between us. I propose a toast. To Vivian, the image of purity. She devoted all her love to my stepbrother. My brother, my beloved brother! She has overcome the crisis, but the tension is too much for her weak heart. Give her one pill, every 3 hours. - How old is she? - She is as old as the world. She lives tied to the past. She's like a medieval relic. - She may have a thousand years. - Do you believe it? - I only believe in what I covet. - And what would that be? - Answer me. - Money, I want money and power. But also the white skin of the girls. And you, Batman, what are your beliefs? I've opened soft white skins with the help of my bistoury. And I can assure you that from the inside, they are all equal. Nah, I don't believe in women. - Then, what do you need? - I don't want money as badly as you. Perhaps in the folly of men. In the power over the human mind, I believe in blood too. Maybe it's a practicing pathology, But the truth is that I love to see it spring, seeing blood flow. I bet you so begins a criminal mind. Nah, I am a scientist. Although it attracts me to see the blood flowing, alive. As a farmer enjoys seeing running water that fertilizes the soil. We just need a start. We can do great things together. Alex... we must be careful not to forget that there is the law. Is the devil acting outside the law? All of us we carry evil. There is an intrinsic human sadism, and it occurs when the time is right; then takes over the will, overflowing. We are not perfect, Alex. I don't know who's playing better cards? The devil, or our consciences? Tonight, you will find out. Warn the conspirators, we will meet tonight. - At mindnight. - They know it, I hope you are able to convince them. - The hour has come, the risk is high. - See you, Alex. I must admit that your master has infected me with his lust for power and money. Bye, Rene... Hey, by the way, I've always thought that your silence makes you the perfect servant. Alex has said great things about you. You will be a good tool to use in the days ahead. There will be a lot of money for everyone. If you are loyal, you will be rewarded. Of course we should keep our eyes wide open. I heard that the dumb have a sixth sense. I hope we can use that extra sense. Bye. Be welcome, brothers of Satan. Have a seat. Every 100 years, on the third night of the invocation, along with the last stroke of midnight, the king of Darkness comes to his disciples, In the Castle of the Montan, to drink with his brothers, the blood of a virgin, and to share his power on earth. Our generation will never experience a moment like this. Century to century, the Montans have assembled gathered in this very room, to the chosen ones. This is the first night. We are all here. - Do you accept the sacrifice? - We do. You always get away with it! I want you and I to be married at once. I don't have enough money, we have to wait longer. - Your mother is wealthy. - My mom is nutts, she believes she's talking to devil. I'm scared. I swear there are nights that I hear the cries of your ancestors. Shut up! Hallucinations from your own mind. - Are you nutts too? - I don't know. Sometimes I think that you don't care about me. - You used me like you use those fanatics. - Those men only come here to forget the boredom! Don't you lie! You met last night and spoke of a human sacrifice. Rubbish! We don't sacrifice a thing in this house! I am not a criminal! The legend states that the night of the 23th of June, this year, the Montan family will sacrifice the life of a young girl. Do you believe in legends? I love you Alex, but I fear something beneath your skin. Sure, I'm the Devil. You have not seen anyone! the two of them are dead, you know? He has come, I've seen him. He wore the blue suit from the school party. Mom, Clay died when he was 32. He and his father have come to see me many times, and they cry because they are afraid. Death must be sad. Leave it, you don't know anything about it. Look mom, by the way... the attorney needs your signature here. I will not sign! you have always coveted my money. This inheritance is my right! I wasted my youth to take care of you! Everyone is dead, and you will sign this paper! I will not sign. Clay and Walther will return. Clay is dead. And he was no son of yours. I'm the only Montan. That money is mine! No! That will never be! The fortune belonged to his father, so Clay deserves it. It will never be yours! Only Clay can claim it. That was my promise. But mom, lack of money leads me to do wrong things. You will receive your share, the castle and the lands are ours, Walther! Clay! Why did you leave me? Easy mom, don't you worry. When you get better we'll speak again. I like the girl, so your choice is a success, Batman. She has been carefully selected. I guess you have investigated her, what is her personal data? Alma Beilan, aged 22. Orphan, lives by herself. No relatives, She was recently admitted to the clinic. Hopefully no one will miss her. - Should I go? - Seems great to me. The pay is great, just a few days of work. I'll drive you there. - But we just started to know each other. - I'll visit you. Vivian! Welcome, Vivian! - Hello, how are you? - Happy to see you again. - How was the trip - Fine, but it took a long time. Step inside. Mom will be happy to see you. This car belonged to Clay, how come you...? My car had an accident, now I use this car. - I remember you liked it. - Please tell me what happened. Not now. I want to see you happy. We will pick a better time to talk. You delayed your visit much We thought you had already forgotten about us. Clay's death has affected me much. At first I fell ill. And then I realized there was nothing for me here. Nonsense. We all love you at home, and you know I have feelings for you. No? Step inside. Well, on our way! How is your mom? How is she feeling after the death of Clay? It was very hard for her. The hysterics are more frequent now. - How are you! - Vivian, I'm glad you're here! My girl, stay here forever. Alex, leave us alone. Have a seat. I'm very sick. I have something I want to show you... Have a look. This is Clay, I know he loved you. He and I would have married. But he did not want to upset Alex. Before then, the three of us played as kids. But my love for Clay suddenly appeared. Our love. Everything was so perfect that it now seems like a dream. I loved Clay. And I will love him forever. But we had to go slowly. Alex thought he loved me too. Clay really didn't want to hurt Alex. And never wanted to upset you. He loved you as his real mother. He was so different. How did the accident happen? Alex doesn't want to talk about it. Perhaps to spare me suffering. Alex and Clay were not friends. They used to fight. One day, Clay threatened to leave, he was excited. He the took the car and left, but the car went over the cliff and caught fire. It was horrible. They could hardly recognize him. But he comes to visit me. He didn't forget about me. My husband comes very often, I speak with him every night. This is really weird. Clay was such a great driver. You know, the idea of returning here wasn't too exciting for me. But now, I'm glad to be here, with the family. Remembering our adventures, you, me and... Clay. Yeah, you always made me sit on one side in the games. You wanted to be alone. Do you remember? Look, that door leads to the basement, do you remember how scared I was? I want to have a look. - It's closed. - Yeah, the roof is about to collapse. Come, let's check the stables. Tomorrow we'll take a stroll through the countryside. Here is your Castle, my queen. So long, my darling prince, I hardly know you, but I will miss you. You look like a girl on the first day of school. - When will we meet again? - Next week. - It will be a long wait. And for me too. Morning, I want to see Mr. Montan. I am a nurse, sent by doctor Batman. Greetings miss, I'm Alex Montan, how are you? I'm fine, although I am somewhat impressed by this Castle. To live in a Castle has it's advantages and disadvantages. At first it may seem a little disturbing, but you will find peace within its solid walls. Once you get used to being here, it is very hard to leave this place. Don't worry, I will try to adapt very quickly. I'm Vivian, hello. She's a nurse, and she'll be taking care of mom for a while. Be welcome, I hope we become friends. You will see that this place has its charm. - What's your name. - I'm Alma Deilan. I want to introduce you to Simone, she is our housekeeper. Simone is very helpful. She knows, as nobody else, the secrets of this place. - Nice to meet you. - Simone will take you to your room. - Dinner at ten. - Sharp. When will you introduce me to your mother? Tomorrow, Mom is resting now. Simone, please take the lady. Follow me. Don't forget, dinner at ten! - What have you come here for? - I beg you pardon? - Why are you here? - They have not told you? - I'm here as a nurse. - I'm the only one who has cared for the lady. Then, what am I doing here? Are you really the housekeeper? I'm... follow me! First the demise of my stepfather, and then the death of my brother, were the leading causes of mental disorders for my mother. Your help will be very useful to us, ma'am. I've always thought that nurses work requires great vocation. Yes, indeed. Much patience is needed. Life as seen through the eyes of a nurse can't be very good. Well, you are professionals and the pain of others does not affect you in the same way as us. I'm trying to say, this is the result of being professional. the heart is cooled very quickly. and science prevails over reason, without warmth. What do you think about it, miss? I think that when you don't have love, or the vocation of giving life to others, our profession is meaningless. Very well said, you have given us a lesson. What's happening? That is my mother, she often suffers from these crises. The first few minutes are critical, but her condition will improve with time. Simone, go to her and give her some pills. You shall meet her tomorrow, if she see you now, she could get more anxious. Every hundred years, and after the call of the last stroke of midnight, the King of darkness will appear in the Montan castle. And will meet with his faithful disciples to drink the blood of a virgin, and to share his power on earth. The virgin may be identified by a cross in the palm of her right hand, I'm Mina Montan, the mother of Alex. You're the nurse who has come to look after me. Sorry if my presence here is sudden, but I wanted to talk you. Don't be afraid. Come. Fear not. How can a poor old woman scare you? - So, you're the girl we were waiting for? Yes, indeed, Ma'am. - Have they spoke you about my illness? - Barely. Well, I'm totally nutts. They said so. I'm nutts! - Who said that? - Simone and that woman. They both want to see me dead. No, my dear. This is not part of my dementia. It's the truth. They want to see me fall dead to get their hands on the inheritance of my husband. They will not succeed in this. My husband will return some day. Despite what they say, he never left me, and they will have to face a huge surprise. He has also a son... Clay. A good boy, he was his inheritor. Clay... died. So you are here to take care of me, no? Yes indeed, Ma'am. Well, you just sank into a nest of vipers! Leave! Leave before is too late! Show me your hand... No! The left one! - Ah, you're not already marked. - What do you mean? Ah, the attack once again! Bring me the medicine, it's in the dining room. Go on, hurry up! Run my dear or I will die! Goo... Good evening. Ma'am! Vivian! Where is the lady? That dumb man has given me a terrible fright! I'm scared, I can almost hear his step behind me. Take it easy, you should not fear. I just left her in the room. That dumb man is an old servant, unable to do the lesser evil. No one will hurt you. Try to rest. - There are no ghosts in this castle. - I Still don't understand why you come here on vacation. Come on. Take it easy. You need to rest. Fear not. See you in the morning. Nite. Vivian! Vivian! You can't run away from me! You're already mine! My stay here has been unforgettable. I love you, Clay. Let us go. Alex keeps stalking me. We must wait before our wedding. She is sick and we shouldn't upset her. You'll see that Alex is just driven by a passing caprice. I don't want to leave without you! I can't believe that your father disappeared a year ago! - Vivian... - The matter was too mysterious. Vida is sick and needs me. When she married dad, she took me as her own son. - Now, I can't just turn away. - But Alex is her son. He must take care of her. Alex only wants her money. I will not leave her, and not now, after what happened to Dad. I have a hunch: If we parted we'll never meet again. The legends of the castle have influenced you. Alex is the promoter of these lies, he uses the legend to beguile a few believers. - There are still fanatics like that? - A lot of them People willing to pay large sums, this represents a risk to Alex They increasingly ask for more and more in return of their money. I must prevent this from overflowing. Have a chair, Brothers of Satan. Everything is ready for the sacrifice tomorrow. You have been informed that the price for the victim is very high. Are you willing to pay the sum that has been set and communicated? - We are. - All arrangements will be finalized. I'm coming! Wait for me. Do not fret. Wake up. Wake up! I have many things to tell. Vivian is here, do you remember her? That girl who ran around the castle. Yeah, before I hid you in this place. You know, many people want to know where your hideout is. Why are people so curious? They remain wondering. This is our secret. I will tell nothing. Why do you never answer my questions? Why are you so quiet? Speak to me. Speak to me! You wanted to leave me. To run away with that woman! You didn't love me. You never really listened to me. You were saying that I was nutts. And I loved you! So I decided to lock you up here. So, you will run no more! Tomorrow I will come to greet you. Please do not shout at night. The idea was yours, right? - Oh no, she asked for it. - You lie. You have an inordinate interest in Vivian. She wants to ride a horse? Let her go alone! Simone, don't make trouble, she's part of the family. You have never invited me to ride. I'm just a mere housekeeper, your maid. But I have always to be available for your desires. But, you haver never learned about horses. You're jealous, come on. You know that I only love you. Hello. Top of the morning, Vivian. You're more beautiful than ever. - You're very kind, Alex. - I would like to hold back time, just to enjoy this forever. That can't be done. Time is relentless and never stops; time drags everything, to death. Men should rebel against those laws. What do you think about it? At any rate, that would be a useless rebelion. Come Vivian, the old paths in the field, may allow us to go back in time. If I were you, I would take advantage of the present, you two are still young, to live only in memories. It makes a lot of sense. Did you hear that, Vivian? We should take the doctor's advice. We will meet again tonight, I have to return to my office. You should take care, the horse is very young. Thanks. Remember how to ride? I really hope so. By the way, miss, you haven't told me how you like the castle? Well, I'm not really used to it yet. In this house there is no way to close my eyes at night. Are you scared? Leave that for old farts and kids. I warned you, this is a rebellious horse. It's not easy to control it. Well, it's more fun this way. Lovely lake! Remember how many times we swam here. I think I will never forget. You can't beat me! I will not fall! You will see! Let's see if he can endure this. Tricky kids! You will see! I dare you Vivian, I will jump over your heads! Hey! I am a fish in water! He's silly! Come Vivian! I challenge you to a race! Deal! I'm by myself here. You don't know the castle, all my relatives were born and died here. You see, There is a rosebush over 500 years old. It has never stopped giving flowers. Just like the Montan bloodline! Thanks, you're nice. Please go with Rene, he will show you the place. Then come back to me and let me know what you liked most. You're an angel. - This has been a wonderful day, Vivian. - Yes, it was worth returning to this place of memories. With you, I'm a better man, a new one. Now, there are no barriers between us. - Are you happy? - I have a weird feeling. Every single thing on the road, brings Clay to mind. Clay is dead. That's forever. Please think about us. It's easy. I can't Alex. I came up here just to overcome the memory. But everything has been worse. I feel like I love him more than ever! He's an ideal in your mind, so you're dazzled by a mirage. - I can help you to forget him. - Better tell me how the accident happened. I prefer not to talk about it, I know it's painful for you. I want to know about it, I have the right to. It happened in a stupid way, as many accidents occur. I tried to stop him; then he lost control on a curve, drove off the cliff and the car caught fire. And you couldn't do anything to save his life? It was useless. By the time I reached the bottom of the cliff, he was only ashes. It is doubtful, Clay used to be a great driver. Forget it. Think about us. You know I love you. And I've waited for this moment! I beg you not to talk me that way. I can't see you as... Enough! What he has given you that I can not provide? I'll be very rich. You can have anything you want. I don't want money. What I seek in life is something that your mind can not understand. That is the fundamental difference between you and Clay! Hands off! Vivian, wait! Vivian! Let me go! Help me! Let her go! Oh Vivian! this has been awful Damn you! The next time you do something else against my orders, I will kill you! That's enough! - Hello. - I want to talk to Dr. Batman, or Dr. Pierre, this is an emergency. Hello. Ah, hello Alma. Pierre, I need to talk to you urgently! When can you come here? Yes, I want to see you. I can't talk but you'll hear it when you see me. My mother waits for you upstairs, time for medication. Yes. "Find a girl", Montan family firm. Urgent. No relatives. Alma. Vivian! Strange events are occurring! Alex cut off the phone line! I don't want to stay here any longer! Let's go. We must leave at once. You have to help me, please. Yes, I guess you're right. They are all nutts. I'm afraid too. But we must leave at dawn otherwise, we'll get lost in the woods. Close the door, and try to rest. Yes, you are the one. I thought I'd lost you forever. Knowing that you live is the only thing that drives me to survive. All this time. I love you, Vivian. This is me, Clay. Don't be afraid. You probably can't recognize me. No, fear not. This is me. Clay. Go on! Run! Over here! I swear it's him! He has escaped! Faster! Here I am Alex, come and get me! What's up! What's all the fuss! I've seen something very strange. He looked like a dead man! Alex! Don't you hide! Damn you! How have you got out? Take him! Now! Everything was like a hallucination. This can't be true. I can't believe it. Am I losing my head too? What happened to you? Did you see something? She claims to have seen a monster! I saw Clay, it was him. You're anxious; it must have been a bad dream. Take it easy, try to get some rest. You have a very active imagination. Yes, you're right. I'm going to bed now. - You should do the same, miss. - Oh yes. Good night. See you in the morning. - Who's is it? - Vivian... I've seen Clay. His eyes... his voice. I'm worried about him. We must find him. Can you come with me? Of course, I wont stay here alone. Come. Don't touch him, he could be deranged! It's him! It's Clay... alive! Why is he locked away here? Vivian? I thought I would never see you again. Alex did this, HE is deranged. He wants my father's money. Please leave. Greed has made him a man without scruples. Please leave, Vivian. I don't know what's happened to me. I can't move! I will not leave. We have to take you out of this place. I found you, we will not be separated again. No Clay, always together. Vivian... leave... Vivian. Leave me here. This is a very strong drug! It's a high-powered stimulant. This makes him upset. Now I fully understand the situation. He's under the influence. And this is a powerful sedative, combined, they can cause dementia. My dear Vivian! This is a mistake, you shouldn't enter here! Now, you know too much. This forces me to take extreme measures. Leave... go Vivian... They should not leave here! Run Vivian! Not her! Get the other one, she must not escape! Come! Stop! Stop, please! Oh, thank God! Doctor, please take me away from here! This place is full of murderers, they want to kill me! The police are on their way, calm down. I'm very afraid doctor. Vivian is in great danger. Please calm down, Alma. Please get in the car. Perhaps the police have already arrived. We were lucky, it all could have gone to hell! Congratulations doctor. If she had escaped, what a mess. By the way, there's a suprise for you, instead of just one victim, you have two! I like surprises, especially in this class. Is everything ready? We followed the instructions; we'll proceed according to the ritual. I hope there are no more problems, but we must keep our eyes open. - If someone discovers the plan, we are lost. - My men are guarding the place. - Is all the money already here? - Yes, Alex has it. The brothers of Satan will arrive at the stipulated time. Remember your men are paid to safeguard the sacrifice. As you ordered, sir. The new order is to kill all who approach the castle. The important thing is that the sect feel safe here. Understood? Sure, nobody will bother you. My men are ready. It's about time. You have done well to ensure the safety of our customers. So the show will pass quietly. Some of them were nervous, but they will all be here. They can't wait. This will be unique. They will not forget it all their lives. Yes, this is inevitable; When these fanatics are part of the ritual they will give us all their money. They will deliver to the last penny, and be our slaves. It seems perfect. There is just one thing I can't fully understand: Vivian, I thought you loved her. Beautiful women always bring complications. Love is not the main thing, she would rather go to hell with Clay. She doesn't know that her beauty will be useless soon. You're too hard. I don't understand how you can be so cold towards love. To my mind, it's the feeling most grounded in men. Beyond power and money. True love is a lie. There's only desire. Once satisfied, everything ends. And when this is not satisfied, it easily becomes hatred. But leave feelings off the table, better to think of the distribution of money. That money that now comes into our pockets. Don't you think so? You are right. At the end, only the money matters. And we've got it this time. I'll go and change my clothes; I want to look good as a host. Stop, all that money is mine! I'm still the Duchess of Montan! The owner of this Castle and the land right to the horizon! History is on my side, I will not be deceived. Sorry, but that money is not just for me. your son and I have the following arrangement: You end up with nothing. Never in our history, has there been a human sacrifice, with the absence of the householder. This is useless, the Devil will not come. I'm the only one with the power to invoke! Take it easy, if that is what you really want... I will talk to Alex, and you will be part of the ceremony. What are you doing? You are deranged. I made a mistake with you! You can't fool me anymore, I know it all! Your brother Clay is still alive. You've kept him in the dungeon all this time. Those were his cries! I have lived with your lies, deceived. You're sick, Alex. You're crazy. As crazy as your mother! And all that gang are just a group of sadistic murderers! You want to sacrifice the girls? Over my dead body! I will call the police. And I'll free Clay! Sorry Simone, I'm a little lost. Help me to prevent that crime. Those are the murderers! You are right! They forced me.. I couldn't help it. I could not do anything. Now, let us go to release my brother. Please believe in me. Come, come with me. I love you, please help me. Only you can save me. I would do anything for you. Please, come with me, let us free my brother. Brothers of Satan, have a seat. All gathered on the third night, after a fast of one hundred years, and to assist the miracle of light for the shadow men, with their bloodthirsty bodies, all wills distressed by the long wait, be united in the desire to see Satan appear. Here represented by the skull of an anthropoid, with which the intended victim, will be marked, so that the knife will sink into her body, at the moment of the last stroke of midnight. and then, everybody will drink her blood. Follow me. All eyes focus on this skull, and all minds together in an invocation to Satan. This is the victim chosen by Satan. They are about to kill her, Clay. She is going to die! Only you can help her. Run Clay! The door is wide open! The victim will be marked, so the knife blade can seal her body. At the moment of the last stroke of midnight. Hand me the key for the shackles. I know that you have it in your pocket. Hands off, you bastards! Let us run, now! Look out! Stop, he is my son. The only thing I have! Alex... Alex...! Don't be afraid. Don't move. Stand still. Alex! Alex! Alex! Come on, hurry, follow me! Alex! Oh, you! Thank God! - Pierre... - Calm down. It's all over. One more step and I'll kill you. I don't want to hurt you. Give me the spear. Listen Alex, trust me... I'll talk to the police. I assure you that nothing will happen to you. Please give that to me. I have always spoken the truth, Alex. Believe me, give it to me. You can not fool me. One more step and this goes right through you! You are sick, you are not responsible for your actions. - Stop! - Don't do this! Clay! My love! Poor thing. :: Subtitled for CG :: :: Proof-read: Fearlono :: :: Translation + timing: Spinal :: April 2012
