(FIRE CRACKLING) (MUFFLED RADIO SPEAKER) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (WHOOSHING) (SOMBER PIANO MUSIC) (FAINT RADIO BROADCASTS ECHOING) MALE RADIO DJ: And we're back from our commercial break. When we left off we were talking to Chris in Fort Lauderdale. Chris, are you still there? Chris? (OMINOUS MUSIC) Annie, is Chris still on the line? CHRIS ON PHONE: Ugh. I don't know what to believe anymore. I mean, I feel like there's... (CHRIS SIGHING) I feel like I'm going crazy. All the evidence. All the evidence says that I'm not. MALE RADIO DJ: Okay, Chris. Just tell us, again, what's going on so that people who are just tuning in, they can catch up to speed. (OMINOUS MUSIC) CHRIS ON PHONE: Well, things have been coming up missing and reappearing in places I don't leave 'em. I'm waking up in the middle of the night and my nightstand's always knocked over. Blinds ripped down. And they'd be these bruises. Bruises keep popping up on my legs. It has to be aliens! ANNIE: Sol? MALE RADIO DJ: Yeah? ANNIE: Ask Chris, what's his work schedule? SOL: Annie, you don't have to be nervous. You can ask him. ANNIE: Ask him, please. SOL: Chris. Chris, I don't mean to cut you off. But do me a favor and tell me something. CHRIS ON PHONE: What? SOL: I wanna know about your work schedule. CHRIS ON PHONE: My work schedule? I'm not really working much right now. I drive rigs. Big rigs for a water company. About nine months, I think. SOL: Okay, Chris, then so you've been taking uppers for like nine months? And then now you quit because you're on break, right? CHRIS ON PHONE: Yeah. But I don't really... SOL: Well, Chris, unfortunately for me but fortunate for you, you're not being abducted. CHRIS ON PHONE: What? What? SOL: Chris, you're sleepwalking. CHRIS ON PHONE: Sleepwalking? SOL: You're sleepwalking. CHRIS ON PHONE: No. SOL: Your body has created an addiction to these stimulants and you've been on them for like nine months and then you just stop. CHRIS ON PHONE: No, no, Sol. That's not, that's not right. Well, okay, Chris. Well, just continue cutting back on the stimulants and you'll be fine. (CHRIS MUMBLING ON PHONE) You know, no more bruises, tipped over furniture. CHRIS ON PHONE: I'm okay. And voilà, you'll be back to normal. And with that, folks, Annie's giving me the signal that we are out of time. Tune in tomorrow night to see what our brilliant Miss Annie has in store for us. So until then, drive safe, sleep tight and keep an eye to the sky. ANNIE: Seemed a little off today. Yeah, I haven't been feeling right for the past few days. I have these spots that popped up on me. No idea where they came from. My heart was like jumping around. I went to the doctor, he puts me on this heart monitor for a month. So I have to just wait and see what happens. But it's strange. But enough of that. Now, with you, what's wrong with your accent? What're you having a problem with it for? (CHUCKLING) Look, I'm just not comfortable doing it. I appreciate you trying but I'd appreciate it more if you didn't. Well, you know I'm gonna keep pushing you. Yeah, you wouldn't be you if you didn't. Well, on another note, what tipped you off about this last caller being a sleepwalker? Well, my dad, he used to work crazy work hours when I was little. Sometimes, 25, 26 hours straight just hopped up on coffee. Oh. One day he lost his job (SOMBER MUSIC) and we started noticing weird things. Like, his tools would be out of place or the fridge door left open or the car keys in the toilet. In the toilet? But the weirdest thing was he had these bruises all over his legs, so one night, I stayed up pretty late reading my mystery stories and I heard footsteps down the hall. It was my dad. So I follow him to his room where my mom's dead asleep and as he walks to the bed, he slams his legs into the night stand. So that's the whole thing, that's it, that's the story. 20 years I've been dying to get a real story and as soon as it looks like I have one, you knock it right out from under me. (LAUGHING) But overall, a good night. Well, yeah, that's true. And no worries. I'll be digging up a really good topic for tomorrow. Yeah, I'm sure. But in the meantime, go home, get some rest, or you'll be coming in here with bruises on your legs. That's true. All right, all right, I will, I know. (DOOR CRACKING) Hey, guys, I don't mean to break anything up. I was told to get the studio prepped for Fabian's morning show. Yes, sir, boss man. I guess that's my cue, so. Would you drop this off at the break room? ANNIE: Will do. SOL: Thank you. Of course, sure. Wow. (MUFFLED RADIO SPEAKER ECHOING) WOMAN: Goodnight, Annie. Goodnight. WOMAN: Good show tonight. Thanks. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (ENGINE RUMBLING) (RADIO BUZZING) (WOMAN SPEAKING MUFFLED ON RADIO) (CAR HORN BLOWING) (KNOCKING) Hey. That's not good for your car, you know? Huh? Just letting it idle for so long. I read online it starts to build corrosion in your... Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I get it. Strange guy by your car in the middle of the night. Mm-hmm. Yeah, look, I'm Jared. I live like one door down from you. Watch you almost every night. Oh. Oh, no, no, no, I didn't mean it that way. It's a bad choice of words. Look, I work customer support online but I work it from my house and I'm kind of a night owl so I take the graveyard shifts. I usually pop out at like one or two and I see you pull in and you fumble with your things as you go to your door. Mm-hmm. Okay. I know Sol. I mean, I don't know him, know him. I mean, he was friends with my grandparents and I knew he sold you his place out here, so. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Sorry. I guess that just me. So, Jared? Jared, yeah. Nice meeting you. Likewise. I just, I thought it was kinda weird. You know, you pulled in a lot later than you usually do and then you just kinda sat here. Well, yeah, I might have zoned out for a minute or something but... What time is it? What? - What's wrong? - No, wait. Wait, what's wrong? Kidding me? JARED: Is everything all right? Yeah, yeah. It's fine, it's just... I just don't remember driving home. I remember heading to my car and then you knocking on my window. Highway hypnosis, have you heard of it? That's what it is. Like, I drove from here to Miami and back on one cup of coffee and I can't remember a thing. I can't remember why I drove out there. I think it was for my training or something. Annie? (FIZZLING) Annie? Oh, yeah. - Sorry. - Hey. Look, how about we get you to your apartment? I guess so, all right. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Look, Jared, I'm fine. You don't have to do this. Annie, at least let me fail at being a gentleman on my own. Oh yeah, I know. Just trying to be nice, right? Anyways, here we are. Yep. Here we are. Here you are. Thanks. It was nice to finally meet you. Yeah, nice meeting you. Hey, this is against my better judgment but would you like to come in? Just have a coffee or something? Yeah, sure. I've got time. Okay. Cool. This is it. TV ANNOUNCER: Water is what gives us life. It's a precious, limited resource which is vital to our... JARED: It's funny. What? This. I never expected it to be this messy. (CHUCKLING) Really? JARED: It's like a bum became a crime investigator or something. Okay. There goes the point where you begin failing as a gentleman. Oh, no, no, I don't mean it that way. It's, it's refreshing to see a woman that's so involved with her work. Hmmm. I can tell you're not knee-deep in the latest fashion or running to the bathroom every five minutes to fix your face. Okay. Have you ever successfully given a woman a compliment? All right, look, wait, you got coffee, right? Yeah. How about I make us a pot? Sounds good. (MUFFLED TELEVISION COMMOTION) JARED: Looks like you're all out. Is ice water just as good? Mm-hmm. You know, that was an amazing show tonight. (WATER FAUCET RUNNING) Oh, you listen? Friends with Sol. Kinda. Yeah, I listen. I mean, a lot of people think Sol's pretty nutty but I think he's right on the money sometimes with a lot of his stuff. I mean, that's... That's clearly why you work there, right? I mean, you have to believe in all the extraterrestrials and UFOs. Oh, no, no, no. Me believing in these show topics isn't a part of my job. I was actually hired because I don't believe in this stuff. Well, how does that make sense? Well, 'cause I'm there to disprove the little stories, weed out the hoaxes. Find logic in the bigger ones. All right, I can see that. It's kinda like religion. Like how some one would rather be preached to by a former atheist turned Christian than someone who's been a believer in God their whole life. There's just something more powerful in the words of skeptic-turned-believer. It's kinda genius, actually. Especially once they make you a believer. (MUFFLED TELEVISION COMMOTION) Try and get some sleep, Annie. (EERIE MUSIC) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (ELECTRICAL BUZZING) (WHOOSHING) (GASPING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) TV ANNOUNCER: To stay hydrated, we must drink half of our body weight in water a day and that's why you should drink Arch Filtered. Our water is naturally purified using the same process that occurs in natural springs. (SOMBER MUSIC) (MUFFLED TV COMMOTION) You know what's on them satellites come crashing down? Diseases. Diseases we ain't even got a name for. Space germs. YOUNG MAN ON TV: Can't nothing live out in space, man, not even germs. There's no atmosphere. Odell, give my quarter back! (MUFFLED TV COMMOTION) (ANNIE BREATHING HEAVY) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (CLOCK TICKING) OLD MAN ON TV: Sit done, Smokey, you'll get dizzy again. YOUNG MAN ON TV: This machine has had it.

I'm getting ready right now. I'll be there as soon as I can, okay? SOL ON PHONE: Calm down, take a breath. You're not in trouble. We were just a little worried when you didn't show up. I know, I was just, I don't know, I must have... I just had a weird night, that's all, but I'm getting ready right now and I have a great story for tonight, okay? SOL ON PHONE: All right, all right. Stop apologizing. Just get yourself together and get down here. Okay, all right, thank you Sol, see you soon. SOL ON PHONE: See you soon, kiddo. Taking a look at our seven day forecast, we've got plenty of clear skies headed our way starting with today at a high of 87, a low of 81, bringing us into a little cooler night tonight with a high around 69 and continued clear skies. And speaking of clear skies, Janis, I don't know if you caught that surprise meteor shower last night. We've had photographs flooding in from our viewers in Gulf Breeze. Really beautiful stuff. Well those are some beautiful pictures, Stan. Can't beat surprises like those. And to continue the subject of the sky, our next story involves strange sounds heard from the sky this morning. The story has piggybacked on the meteor shower and is one of the top trending topics online. Have you seen this? Or better yet, have you heard this? The authorities' emergency lines and new stations have been flooded with reports of strange noises being heard all around the world and just as close as our backyard here in Gulf Breeze. That's right, we've experienced a first time taste of "the sound" this morning. Our own news station believed it to be a hoax until researched proved this is not to be an isolated event. There's more on this story at 11. Oh, come on. Let's see. "Gateway to Hell Found." "Superpowers." (MUTTERING) (SIGHING) How is this not on the news? (TRAFFIC COMMOTION) (MUTTERING) (COMPUTER KEYS CLICKING) Okay, so I've never done a blog before. This is my first one, so here it goes. So the other night I heard this sound, right? Yeah, so I heard this sound and it was about three o'clock in the morning and I thought it might be a plane but it was continuous. I had never heard anything like that before so I did some research. I found a video online that was from Berlin and I'm in Michigan but it was the exact same sound. Leave a comment if you know or maybe you heard it too. I can't be the only one. I heard the sound again tonight. I caught the tail end of it. It must've literally just stopped. My boyfriend thinks I'm screwing with him but I know I heard it again. If anybody else did, you know, send me a message or comment or anything. Just let me know somebody else heard it. Okay, I have finally caught it. It's, I mean, it's like 3AM. But I finally caught it. I've been waiting up every night and I've finally caught it. So I'm gonna show you guys, all right? Here, here we go. All right. (MECHANICAL RUMBLING) I don't know how he's sleeping through this, it's crazy. It's like, it's louder than it's ever been before. (MECHANICAL RUMBLING) You guys must be able to hear this. It's like this crazy metal sound.

Oh yeah, ha, ha, really funny, very. I don't know, I don't know what happened. I think I'm just in some kind of funk right now. Well don't go getting sick on us. You are what makes the program interesting. Hmmm. I have to check in on studio one. If you don't need anything else, that is, sir. You're good to go. We'll see you after the show. All right, kiddo. Annie. Feel better and if you need anything, just let me know. Will do. (DOOR CREAKING) Talk about a crush. How're you doing, kiddo? Ugh, all right, I guess. Just a little out of it, it seems like. How so? I don't know, like me oversleeping today. I mean, I knew I was tired but four hours? And then I'm constantly thirsty. And what about now? Yeah, all the time. Just, I don't know, and last night I don't remember driving home. I remember being home, sitting in my parking lot but nothing else. Oh, and thanks for not telling me about Jared, that neighbor guy. He came to my car, knocked on the windows. Scared the hell out of me. Gosh. Annie, how can you not see what's going on? What do you mean? Lost hours, (EERIE MUSIC) oversleeping, dehydration. Yeah. This all speaks of... (CLINKING) alien activity. Ugh. (OMINOUS MUSIC) See, I knew I couldn't tell you this. I knew you wouldn't take it seriously. But I am being serious. I mean, what other explanation could it be? Oh, let's just save it for the show, okay? Great. Okay, look. We have a few songs left until we air, so I stumbled upon a great topic for tonight, actually. I had something yesterday but this is way better. There's been reports about this strange sound being heard thousands of miles apart and nobody knows what it is. Not the NSA, not NASA, not the government. Nobody has answers to what it is. Well, it sounds like we have a good show on our hands. You have no idea and it's all right here. Tell you what, why don't you get yourself a strong cup of coffee, get one for me while you're at it and I'll look at what you have here. Cool, sounds good. Oh. I have a recording of the sound right here. And we're going to play it. (COFFEE POT BUBBLING) Hey, when did we get that? Huh? When did we get that? Oh, this? The station got a new sponsorship from a water company, so naturally they want to put their product everywhere. Mm-hmm. Well, folks, we're back and we're ready to hear what out audience has to say about what can only be described as "the sound." So, we'll be opening up the lines for your calls and I believe Annie has our first call ready to go. Mm-hmm, first we have Jack from Cocoa Beach on line one. SOL: Hi, is this Jack? JAKE ON PHONE: Yes. This is Jack. And you're calling in about the sound, so go ahead and tell us about it. Yeah, yeah, the sound. Here's how it went down. A few weeks ago, me and the buds, just camping out one night. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Well, we saw, I don't wanna freak anybody out or anything, but man, we saw some crazy shit, man! SOL: Well, Jack, what did you see? Well. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (BONG BUBBLING) So, we're like camping out and sitting around the fire and, like, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, I mean the sky just lights up and it was just awesome! (OMINOUS MUSIC) So glorious. And then, all of a sudden... Something doesn't sound right. Recheck his facts, please. SOL: Okay, Jack, so a few weeks ago you and your buddies were camping and taking plenty of hits off of who knows what, (LAUGHING) when a crazy spaceship took off but what you saw was a space shuttle off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. - No way. - And with that, folks, we'll be right back. Aren't you the one who is supposed to be screening these calls, Annie?! I'm sorry. (LAUGHING) I just thought he had such a convincing story. I thought you would want to talk to someone who had a firsthand account of the sound. All right, now that we have had our laughs, can we get back to business? All right, our next caller is Mary from Gainesville. Well, folks, we're back and we're ready to hear what our audience has to say about "the sound." Okay, Mary from Gainesville. Mary, are you on the line? Hello, Sol? I'm a first-time caller (OMINOUS MUSIC) and a first time listener but I just had to tell you, I know exactly what that sound is these people are hearing. SOL: Fill us in. That sound is the good Lord's trumpet calling his faithful to Paradise. SOL: Well, folks, there you have it. Now wait a minute, Sol, I'm not done speaking. Th good Lord is calling his faithful before the end of days. So they can be saved. Well, Mary, if you're correct, have you heard the good Lord's trumpet? MARY ON PHONE: Well. (PHONE CLICKING) Hello, Mary? Well, folks, I guess she heard the good Lord's trumpet. Well, in order to minimize the crazies calling in, we think you should have a little more information and our program director, Annie, has dug up some pretty interesting stuff. So we will let her tell her tale and open up the lines. Annie? (OMINOUS MUSIC) It's over to you. What are you doing? I'm not reading the stories, I just give them to you. - Payback. - Eh? Payback. ANNIE: No. Sorry, folks, I caught Annie off guard but she's collected her thoughts now and she's ready to go. Over to you, Annie. Okay. This is Annie. And... Within the last week, authorities and emergency lines and news stations have been flooded with reports of strange noises being heard all around the world and the first big report to break national news happened last week in Nevada. The second was in Berlin and the third was in Michigan. (CLEARING THROAT) (EERIE MUSIC) Upon further investigation, local authorities were unable to pinpoint an exact location of the source of the sound due to the wide range or reported locations. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Again, many people believe it's just a wide-scale hoax. After a bit of digging, I found that these sounds have been reported as early as 1991 but there were less people actually reporting it. And then just two days ago, all reports of the sounds stopped except for one place, right here in our quiet town of Gulf Breeze. The sound was heard for the first time this morning around 3AM. And with that, we would like you to tell us what you think we could he hearing under the stars. All right, Annie, now before we take our break, Annie told me that she has a recording of the sound and we're gonna play it for you folks right now. (OMINOUS TEMPO MUSIC) (MECHANICAL HUMMING) (GROWLING) (MECHANICAL HUMMING) Um, uh, um... All right, folks, there you have it. What do you think it could be? Give us your thoughts when we come right back. (DOOR CREAKING) Two things, one, you did amazing like I knew you would. Thank you. It felt good. And two, game's over. I want a real phone call when I get back. Yes, sir, boss man. Seriously. No, yeah, I know, will do. (DOOR CREAKING) "Under the Stars," this is Annie speaking. What are you calling about tonight? (OMINOUS MUSIC) Hello? Okay, I'm going to hang up if you don't say anything, caller. MAN ON PHONE: Hello. Yes, hey. This is Annie and you're with "Under the Stars." MAN ON PHONE: I need to talk to you about the sounds in the sky. I know what it is. What it really is. The Arch Corporation, it's them! They are the ones that are make... Okay, sir, please calm down. So you say you know what the sound really is. Can you explain? MAN ON PHONE: Listen, I don't have a lot of time. They are the ones that are causing these sounds! It's like, I don't know, okay? I don't know exactly but it is making the sound. Okay, sir, before I can put you on, I need just a little more information, okay? Listen to me! I work, worked for them! I escaped! They are keeping something there at the facility that is not human! It is pissed! It is dangerous! They have been doing experiments on it and there's no telling what it's gonna do! I know what they are, okay? Okay. Okay, I'll put you through. We still have a little time left. Can you tell me what the sound is? The sound is a physical phenomenon caused when something tries to cross over into our world through the tears. The sound is... (FIZZLING) You're hearing matter being translated into our world. You are hearing them come over! Who's "them?" MAN ON PHONE: I was a lead engineer hired to work on a device codenamed "Project Harmony." I saw something cross over when I tried to turn it on and that's when it made the sound. Okay. I'm putting you through now, okay? Just... (OMINOUS MUSIC) Just a second. You have a creepy caller on line four. He wouldn't give me his name. All right, folks, and we're back and Annie has a caller on the line that apparently we really need to talk to. All right, caller, who am I speaking with? MAN ON PHONE: This is John. SOL: Well, welcome to the show, John, you're on the air. Everyone listening must pay attention! Remember these words! The Arch Corporation, Project Harmony. A device was built as a result of Project Harmony. This device replicates a singularity here on Earth, manufacturing... (FIZZLING) space time. Okay, I don't who where... (MUFFLED SPEAKING) Annie. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Annie, we're losing him! Annie! (PHONE BUZZING) (JOHN SPEAKING MUFFLED) Um... Our signal's fine. It's being cut from his end. (EERIE MUSIC) (RADIO BUZZING) (FOREBODING MUSIC) (MECHANICAL HUMMING) (MECHANICAL RUMBLING) (EERIE MUSIC) (ALARM BEEPING) What the hell is going on? Stay calm. The backup lights will be on in a second. ANNOUNCER: A fire emergency has been reported in the building. Proceed to the nearest exit and vacate the building. Do not use the elevators. (EERIE MUSIC) Sol! MAN ON RADIO: Who are you, my brothers and sisters? Telling you that we are not alone. I want to remind you all today that we are not alone. We are not alone today. (OMINOUS MUSIC) We have never been alone. We will never be alone. "Why?" you ask. "How?" you ask. You see, my brothers and sisters, we are in the presence of He who is called "I Am." The first and the last. The Almighty. We are in the presence of God! (CAR HORN BLOWING) Do you believe Moses was alone when he parted the Red Seas to save his people? No. Oh my Gosh. MAN ON RADIO: Do you believe that David was alone when he slayed Goliath to defeat the Philistines? No. Do you believe that Noah was alone when he loaded two of every creature on this green and beautiful earth on to that ark? (MUFFLED RADIO SPEAKING) To rescue them from the Great Flood? No!

I don't remember any of it. I mean, that's eight hours of my day that's just, just gone. Just nothing, I don't remember any of it. (MAN MUMBLING) Yeah. MAN: We just talked about this.

(CRYING) (EERIE MUSIC) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (LAUGHING) I figured it out. (LAUGHING) I figured it out. I figured it out, I did, I did. You know, me losing time and just everyone acting crazy. It's aliens. It has to be aliens. It is and it's them trying to get into your brain. Can't get in. Bye. If they can't get in, then you're safe. So I'm safe. (LAUGHING) They're not gonna get me. No. They can't get in. (KNOCKING) (BREATHING HEAVY) Hey. ANNIE: Hey, what's up? Sorry to bother you. Is your cable acting funny? Mine's under the fritz for like the last half hour or so. What? I don't know. I hadn't had it on since I've been home. Would it be too much to check to see if yours is the same as mine? - What's? - Um. You look flustered. Did I, uhh...? I didn't scare you, did I? Like bad timing? No, it's... Sorry, it's okay, I'm just a little, a little on edge - but you can come in. - Sure. It's fine. (DOOR THUDDING) (TELEVISION COMMOTION) You can have a seat if you want. Or you can just stand. We interrupt your program to bring you this breaking news story. A grizzly murder scene has been discovered at the water filtration company in Emerald County, just two counties over. Local authorities are looking for this man, 33 year old John Maner, believed to be - armed and dangerous. - Seems okay. Yeah. Like I said, it comes and goes. NEWS ANCHOR: But we're asking our viewers with any information about the whereabouts of... You want a drink or something? No, no, I'm covered. Okay. (TELEVISION COMMOTION) (WATER FAUCET TRICKLING) Are you sure you're okay? ANNIE: Uh, yeah. Hey, you haven't been feeling strange or anything, have you? Me? No. Aside from a bad burrito I had the other day, I'm feeling pretty good. Why, you getting sick? (TELEVISION COMMOTION) Okay, listen. (EERIE MUSIC) Okay. You need to promise me you won't call me crazy or anything, okay? Sure. (OMINOUS MUSIC) I wrote this before I came home but I wasn't in control when I was writing it. We just had this weird phone call about this topic I stumbled on and, you mention earlier, like, strange sounds being heard all over the place, you know? JARED: Right. Okay, so, I talked to this man on the phone and I'm starting to write these numbers and words but... It's like I'm just on autopilot or something. This isn't even my handwriting. You get a weird phone call, you write these notes down and then you black out? I don't know, yeah. I just have, like, these gaps in time... Time gaps. I don't remember anything. Can I have a look? Yeah, yeah, yeah. (EERIE MUSIC) Whoa. This is weird. Do you see something? Yes and no. Do you have a pen? Yeah. Here. This is an anagram. The letters in the sentence have been reorganized so for the untrained eye, it doesn't make any sense. Okay. But if you rearrange the letters, one of the sentences I get out of it is, "They want to colonize." (OMINOUS MUSIC) Yeah. I don't know. The rest is a little more complex. It's like a big puzzle. You just gotta figure out where the pieces go. And these numbers, here, they mean something and I think it has to do with whatever you wrote down. Look, I'm not the best at this but I think I know somebody that can figure it out. Okay. Whatever this is, some part of you didn't want you to know what it means. Oh God, you start sounding like Sol. No, no, no, no. Seriously, let me take these and I'll get this figured out. ANNIE: I trust you with this, okay? JARED: Okay. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (THUDDING) (EERIE MUSIC) (COMPUTER KEYS CLICKING) "Sorry, the blog you are looking for does not exist." What? Shit. (COMPUTER KEYS CLICKING) "Sorry, the blog you are..." Shit. (COMPUTER KEYS CLICKING) "Sorry." "Sorry, the blog you are looking for..." (THUMPING) Jared! Hey. Where are you going? You look different. What did you find out about the notes? I'm just going to the dumpster. Come on, Jared, it's really not the time to joke, okay? What did you find out? Where are my notes?! You're Annie, right? Yeah. And you're Jared. Yeah. And you've been to my apartment two nights in a row. So now, if we're done stating pointless facts, I really need you to tell me what you found out, okay? Or give me my fucking notes! (CRYING) (EERIE MUSIC) JARED: Just hold on. You really don't know who I am, do you? Look, Annie, I'm really sorry. I've been forgetting a lot of things recently. What do you want me to do? If I've done something to you, I'm sorry. (FOREBODING MUSIC) Looks like you're all out. Is ice water just as good? They're telling me things that I'm doing that I can't remember. It's aliens. It has to be aliens. It is and it's them trying to get into your brain. (OMINOUS MUSIC) It's the water. How many did you have of these? None. Maybe since yesterday. Okay, good. This is going to sound strange but don't drink any more of these, okay? Sure. Sol. I need to get to Sol. I know what to do. Oh my God. (OMINOUS BEAT MUSIC) (SINISTER MUSIC) (SUSPENSEFUL BEAT MUSIC) Hey, hey, hey. Where's the fire? Sorry, sir, I didn't see you. James? Yeah, I know, it's different. Yeah. I don't know. This morning I just woke up and just felt, (EERIE MUSIC) new. Sorry, where are my manners? Oh, no, thank you. It's ice cold. Yeah, thank you but no. (OMINOUS MUSIC) JAMES: Annie. (WHISPERING) Sol? How are you today, Annie? (GASPING) (MENACING MUSIC) Sorry, I was just looking for... Didn't mean to scare you. Sol? No, it's find. I just need to talk to you, okay? Wait. (EERIE MUSIC) I think you were right about everything you said. I think everything I had going on has to do with... Aliens. Just get ahold of yourself, Annie. Stay hydrated, you'll get back in the swing of things. ANNIE: Where's your coffee, Sol? That's something, isn't it? No more marks on me. No more heart monitor. I have to get ready for the show. They have everything ready for me to go. What do you mean? I haven't even prepared anything. Look, there are bigger things going on right now, okay? You need to listen to me. Things have changed, Annie. I want to go into a different direction with the classics and current events instead of all that alien stuff. (DOOR THUDDING) (CRYING) You're not Sol. (LAUGHING) (EERIE MUSIC) (HUFFING) Oh my gosh. (EERIE MUSIC) (HUFFING) (CRYING) (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Annie. Annie. It's Jared. I remember, I remember everything. What happened? Listen to me. I'm locked in the back room of my place. Why? Why are you locked in your bedroom? Because there's men in your apartment. (THUDDING) Just listen, Annie. I don't have much time. I don't know who they are. But I found out it has something to do with the water. (JARED MUFFLED SPEAKING) (GLASS SHATTERING) And they have the same bottled water that's in the bottles of water I've been drinking. (DOOR CREAKING) (EERIE MUSIC) (FOOTSTEPS THUMPING) Annie? Annie, are you still there? (DOOR CREAKING) I'm here. I'm in one of the stations. It's different. (ANNIE CRYING) You gotta get out of there. You gotta get out of there right now. Did you hear me? Okay. What about those notes? Listen, the numbers you gave me, the numbers in your notes, I think they're coordinates. It's... 30.44, 33 degrees north by 87.214 degrees west. I'm not sure what's going on but those numbers hold some kind of answer. (EERIE MUSIC) (DOOR CREAKING) What're you doing here? What do you want? (GROWLING) Jared! - Oh no! - Oh no. - (CRYING) - JARED: No! Jared, can you hear me? (GROWLING) (CRYING) Oh no. (GASPING) (CRYING) (PHONE RINGING) Hello, Jared? Jared, can you hear me? GARGLED VOICE: Hello, Annie? Is everything okay? Annie? Are you there, Annie? Annie. (CRYING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (HUFFING) (GROANING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (MEN CHATTERING) (EERIE MUSIC) (HEARTBEAT THUMPING) Annie, wait a minute. (HEARTBEAT THUMPING) I just want to have a word with you. (UNSETTLING MUSIC) (SUSPENSEFUL TEMPO MUSIC) Damn it. (GASPING) (FOREBODING MUSIC) Oh shit. Open the door, Annie. No! No! Please? ANNIE: Get away from my car, James! Don't you wanna be one of us? (OMINOUS MUSIC) ANNIE: James. Don't do this, please. Don't do this to me, you don't have to do this... Open the door, Annie! (ANNIE YELPING) Open the door! (COWORKERS MOANING) Open the door! WOMAN: Annie. JAMES: Annie! (ANNIE SCREAMING) Open the door! COWORKERS: Annie. Join us. Okay! Okay! (SOBBING) Okay.

It's a site that I woke up at. I don't know where I am. I don't know where this is but it's a remote location that I know Arch is using. This is not, this is not just me. People have been disappearing every day. I've seen it happening around this facility. There's people that disappear and then they come back and they're not the same person. I don't know where, I don't know how I got here. I'm trying to find answers and I know they're here. This form is documents that I've seen, I've seen this work, I've seen these notes. I don't know what they're trying to build or what this is supposed to replicate. It's not anything that has been done before. (MECHANICAL GROWLING) (GROANING) What's that?! God! What is that?
