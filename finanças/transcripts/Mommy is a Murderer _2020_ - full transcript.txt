[dramatic music] [intense music] [dramatic music] [intense music] [no audio] [indistinct chatter] We ask whoever took our Emily.. ...please remember she's someone's child. We come to you with an exclusive this morning as new breaks that a three-year old girl was abducted from her home in Copeland County late last night. Investigators say that the young girl was asleep in her room when an assailant forcefully entered her home and abducted her. An amber alert was issued this morning as the unidentified suspect is still at large and potentially dangerous. If you have any information.. [instrumental music] Any little girl dreaming of being a ballerina loves our dresses made of tulle. But...satin dresses are pretty popular with the budding princesses, but my personal favorite is the tulle dress paired with sneakers. [clears throat] [chuckles] And, um, these just, uh, pull the look altogether. Makes you wish you were five again, right? Um, I'll go wrap this up for you. I think I even have a hair bow to match. Be right back. - Hi. - I'm working. - So am I. - No, you're distracting. - Okay, I was working. - Well, go, continue. But I need your approval before I can keep going. Excuse me? I'm just gonna wrap this up in the back where I have the tissue paper, okay? - What do you think? - Oh, Ryan.. Yeah? I mean, whoever we sell this to is-- Maybe we don't sell it. We have a store for selling things. Maybe just put it in the store window but don't sell it. Ah, you stop right there. Or maybe I don't and then you'll be so glad that I had this thing ready to go. We're not ready. - We're ready. - We're almost ready. How much longer? When it's time. But right now I have a customer. She's fine. We cannot behave this way at work. - Says who? - Your boss. [instrumental music] (Cameron) And then he calculated what each of us owed on the tab down to the cent. - Oh, boy. - Yeah. And then I had one spring roll and he divided a quarter of the price of the rolls and added it to my part of the tab. I mean, no wonder he's still single. I-I threw down my cash and I wished him luck. I mean, can you imagine traveling with this man? - I feel sorry for him. - I-I-I know. I mean, he's completely clueless. Well, get back out there. You're gonna find someone. Between work and school, I-I'm literally exhausted. Well, a couple of more tests and you're gonna be a nurse. Yeah, it's that easy. Oh, of course not, but then we can get back to brunches and game nights. Mm, so you can slaughter me at trivia? I'll take you anywhere I can get you. 'Cause I'm your favorite. ♪ Now and forever ♪♪ [chuckling] - Thank you. - Thanks, honey. But, um, Karina, you do need to find another brunch buddy. - Don't say that. - Seriously. I mean, you came out here to get the shop going and to start a family. Shop is doing great and the family thing is well, well, as you say, in the works. [laughs] So it's time, right? I-it's time to find a local lady-friend to have some fun with between our visits. - Are you breaking up with me? - Well.. - I am actually seeing someone. - Oh. He looks an awful lot like a text book. - Stop. - Babe, I love you. I don't mind sharing you. You put so much of yourself into that shop I-I just want you to enjoy this life that you have here. I just don't know anyone out here. You know, it's not as easy to meet people as it was in college. It's not like I work in an office. So what do I do? Well, uh, next time a nice customer comes into the shop ask her to lunch. Start there. Okay. But if she brings out a spreadsheet to calculate the tab? - Run! - Yeah. As fast as you can, okay? - I'll drink to that. - A drink to that. [laughing] ♪ Na-na-na na-na-na na-na na-na ♪ ♪ Na-na-na na-na-na na-na na-na-na ♪ ♪ Na-na-na na-na-na na-na na-na-na ♪♪ Hello there.

She's good, you know she's very close to making all her dreams come true. She just never comes up for air, you know? Oh, I know someone else we could say that about. - The business is doing great. - I know. You can start enjoying the life that we've built here. I know. And I'm not trying to pressure you. I know. I wanna build a family, too. But I just had this idea that when we raise a family, we'll be in a community. And every time I see Cam, it becomes very apparent. - That's not what we have here. - Yet. That's what we need to start building. Not more stuff. Uh-uh. Ooh. - You're right. Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. - I'm right. Mm. - Mm-hmm. Just let me finish the hem. Please. Thanks.

Sleeping safely in her bed was a normal and curious three-year old girl. Then an unidentified assailant kidnapped the child. Now, five years later investigators officially put an end to their search declaring her dead in absentia. Tonight, we bring you this story and others like it in CBN-7's special report on child abduction cases that have run cold in California.

Let's see, shall we? [clears throat] Excuse me, Mr. Hippo. - This little girl-- - 'Mallie.' Mallie would like to know if she can borrow the fairies' dresses. [Karina gasps] The Hippo said the fairies would be honored to share their dresses with you. - I read the most books-- - 'Mallie!' (Lena) You can't take off like that. Mallie, what did I just say? Mom, look. Honey.. ...you are my most precious thing, okay? I don't know what I would do without you. Sometimes I'm just so fast, I can't control myself. I understand, honey. I bet, and you're fast at reading, too. I get a medal in front of everyone! So this dress is for a celebration, huh? Honey, remember, we-we're not doing the ceremony. - Just the dress. - I've never gotten a medal. You're going to get the medal, okay? Her school is honoring the most avid readers in each grade, so.. How exciting! I mean, I don't, I don't love the idea of my daughter being paraded in front of a bunch of strangers. But, you know, you hear all of these things that go on these days and it's.. - 'Yes, of course.' - Yes. Well, how about.. ...you try it on? Oh-oh. Okay. [gasps] - She's so cute. - Thank you. I'm sure I-I sound crazy. It's just you hear these stories these days. And I, I mean, I don't mean to be over-protective but she's, she's literally all I have, so it's.. Of course, you know, I can't even imagine what it's like to parent these days with all the technology-- It's crazy, they're exposed to the world like that. It's.. Well, good for you for keeping such a close eye on her. Thanks, I try. Oh, uh, how about you? Do you have any kids? Mm, not yet. - Not yet. - Yeah. But you-you work here, huh? I own here, actually. - Well, good for you. - Yeah. Little bit of advice for when you do have kids. What they say is true, it takes a village which is something I do not have. - It doesn't fit. - Aw, honey. We'll find you something else. How about I make you a dress? But who made this dress? Fairies or you? Well, I make the dresses for the fairies and I can make a special one for you. (Lena) 'Oh, you don't have to do that.' (Karina) Nonsense. Come on, let's go get you measured. [indistinct song playing] So I'll see you for dinner, instead. [song continues] This is more beautiful than my mind could ever think of. We, uh, we can't thank you enough. You're nice people. It was my pleasure. Sweetie, go get dressed 'cause I've to get to the post office before it closes, okay? But I never wanna take this off. I can watch her while you head over. - Are you sure? - It's no problem at all. Okay, I'll be real quick. Be dressed and ready when I get back, okay, honey? Thank you. Mallie, I have to help this customer right here for just a sec. But over there there's a book shelf. You can read any book that you want to. Okay? I'll be right with you. - Hi, how are you? - Hi, how are you doing? Great. Um, are you interested in this crib? (female #1) 'Yes, I am. I'm very interested in this crib.' (Karina) 'Well, my husband designs all the cribs.' 'He does all the woodwork himself' 'and it's kinda supposed to be reminiscent of' what you would have played with at your grandparents' house when you were young. 'Awesome.' Um, and he also designed the dresser to match so it's kind of a set, uh.. It's trending with all the hipster parents. [indistinct chatter] Mallie, stop! Hey! Hey! [intense music] Honey, sit down, just read a book right there. [panting] Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh. Hey. - What's going on? - We need to call the police. Why? A man, he-he tried to take Mallie. I think, I'm-I'm assuming that it wasn't her father. (Lena) 'No, her father's not in the picture.' Okay. If I hadn't stopped him, he just, he would've taken her. You did, okay? You came to the rescue, so don't, don't call the police. A man tried to kidnap your daughter and you don't wanna call the police? I don't wanna alarm her. Can you imagine a little girl, her age, talking to the cops? They're not exactly good with kids. How can you be so calm? It's just, children pick up on a lot more than they let on and I just.. Please, I-I, I don't wanna make her feel unsafe. You understand? Please, I-I.. I'm so sorry, it happened so quick and I-- Honey, you did, you did great. Really, you're a.. You're a godsend, I mean, I don't.. Oh, my God. How am I ever going to repay you. Oh. Actually, I could start by-by paying you, I mean.. - Here. Please take, take extra. - No, no, no. It's okay, it's okay. Um.. [sighs] I don't know, maybe we could go out for a-a bite sometime you know, I don't know very many people around here. Oh, honey, a bite would be great. - Okay. - On me, okay? - Okay? - We'll see. - On me! - Okay. Thank you. [intense music] Just keep thinking I should've reported the incident today. I mean, what, what if it happens again? Well, you definitely should let people know but you got to respect her privacy. Yeah, but what happens if he succeeds next time? Then what? Oh, that's why we all have to exercise caution. How, when she won't report it? Maybe she doesn't wanna scare her daughter. Yeah, but what about other people's children? I bet you spooked him. - He won't be back. - I hope you're right. Turn that brain off. - Go to sleep. - Okay. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - I am so glad that we did this. - Yeah. I just, I don't tend to get out on my own. Well, the life of a single mother must not be easy. [sighs] Uh, I know that I'm not the only one in town but it really feels like it sometimes. - You know? - Yeah. Does your ex help out at all? He.. [indistinct chatter] [intense music] I prefer to keep anything involving him in the past. I mean, Mallie and I moving here was really about a fresh start you know, so it's important for me to-- Yeah, I-- Lena! Congrats are in order. Dylan told me that Mallie won the Eager Reader Award. - Oh, hey. Thank you. - I'm not surprised. Hi. I don't know you, I'm Emma. Hi, I'm Karina. Nice to meet you. - Our kids share a teacher. - Oh. And thank goodness it's Mallie, too. I mean, Dylan could never. I mean, he's way too shy. 'But your little Miss Thing is gonna steal the show!' Yeah, I'm, I'm not sure Mallie wants to be part of a show. Oh, but she has to, we're gonna have all the winners read a passage from their favorite book you know, to inspire the other kids to read. I'm head of the parents' association. We're always looking for volunteers. Are you local? I am, I own a children's store on 3rd. Get out! What's it called? Juvenile Shop Children's Boutique. I know it. I'm gonna peek by for myself. Mallie got a dress from my shop that I made. - She wanted-- - Actually, about the-- No kidding! We should have you present an award to the kids. You know, we need to show.. [intense music] ...our community supports each other and it would be great exposure for your shop. - I would love it. - Lena, always good to see you. And, Karina, nice to meet you. I've got to run. Always a million things. I'll be in touch. She's a ball of energy, huh? Oh, she sure is. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Yeah, I'm fine. - Will Mallie be excited? Yeah, I guess I am. Have to take back all of that. Oh, my God, I-I.. I'm so sorry, I thought that you, you changed your mind I assumed that-- - It's fine. It's fine. - Oh. I.. Did Mallie say anything about the other day? She, uh, she thought the man knew where the fairies lived and was about to go right along with him. [sighs] See why I have to keep such a tight leash on her? I mean, she's amazing, but she's a handful. Well, I can help keep eyes on her if you'd like me to. That's.. I don't wanna burden you with that. It's not a burden. It's what you do. - Cheers. - Cheers. [intense music] Sounds like you made that new friend you were hoping for. Is it strange that I feel more connected to Lena's kid than to her? You want one just like her? I do. Careful, Lena's gonna think maybe you're trying to swipe her for yourself. Poor Lena. You know, she was so unnecessarily worried about the worst thing happening, and then it almost did. This is the world that we're living in and this is why I have such hesitation. What if I can't protect-- Don't start thinking like that. We live in the kind of world that we make for ourselves and you and I are working towards the life we've always wanted. [instrumental music] We are. - Speaking of work.. - Karina.. You have everything it takes to be a great mother. - I'm glad you're so sure. - I am. I wanna be sure, too. I just hope that one day.. ...I can be everything that a child needs. [bird cawing] More sugar, anyone? Mine is perfect. Thank you. Mine needs more flavor. What kind of tea are we having today, my love? - 'Oh!' - Ooh. I thought I detected, um fresh notes of the garden in my tea. - Delicious, like always. - Mm-hmm. Oh, honey, mommy really needs some caffeine. Are you okay if I go inside and make Karina and I some coffee? Sure, and then you can get rid of the yucky taste with my world-famous delicious tea! (Lena) Okay, my love. I'll be right back. So, Mallie, did you come up with this recipe yourself? Yeah. I just maked it up. Well, it's delicious. Well, I've been having tea parties for a very long time. [laughs] I used to have tea parties with my dolls. Brings back very good memories. Yeah, me, too. I miss my dolls sometimes. - Well, where are they? - I-I don't know. I had different dolls and toys when I was called Emily. Well, is Mallie your middle name? No. At my other house my name was Emily. Right. You moved here right before you started school. Yup. Well, did you change your name when you started school? Mallie? (Mallie) Mom, can we have those treats you were saving for a special day? Well, you're gonna break me down anyway, so, yes. - 'But only one, okay, love?' - Okay. [chuckles] The coffee will just be another minute. This is nice. Yeah, it is. You gotta, you gotta watch her. She'll take two and tell you otherwise. [both laughing] - Yeah, she's quite a character. - Yeah, she is. She, um.. She told me her name used to be Emily. [laughs] Really? Last week she was telling people that her mom was famous. Can you imagine their disappointment when they meet me? I mean.. Oh. What am I gonna do with her? It's odd, isn't it? (Ryan) 'It is, but she's a kid.' 'Kids say things and don't analyze them the way adults do.' Yeah, but what if she was trying to tell me something? - What do you think's going on? - I don't know. But what if something is? Well, you asked Lena and she gave you an answer but you weren't satisfied with it. I think she was dodging my question. Well, uh, she left her husband or something along those lines. Maybe she needs to protect their identity. But what if it's not that and it's something worse? [door chimes chiming] Hold that thought. Emma? Hi. What a little treasure trove. I can't believe I've not been here before. Oh, I brought you a flyer for the assembly. Thanks. Gosh, really, just too cute. Oh, it was so great meeting you the other day and thanks so much for stopping by. I'm sorry I interrupted. But Lena would've kept you all to herself now, wouldn't she? She keeps a lot of things to herself. I mean, you know, in contrast to Mallie because she's just such-- A little spitfire? I know it. Dylan had kindergarten with her, too. So you must know them really well. No one does. Lena keeps her head down and to herself. Which is why I was so happy to see her with you. Well, yeah. Why do you think that is? Well, she's a pinch older. And, well, despite our efforts to rope her in she doesn't strike me as much of a joiner. Yeah, well, you know, it must be hard being all on her own. But, I mean, let your kid take a school picture, am I right? What do you mean? Mallie doesn't do a picture day. Lena is afraid of child predators and how stressful to be wired that way. But enough about Lena. 'I don't want you thinking I'm all gossipy' when we're just getting to know each other. - No, that's not-- - I'm kidding. I'm kidding. But I'm telling you, get ready for a rush because I'm gonna tell everyone about this place. That's so nice of you. Do you hike? I have a group. We, uh, hit the trail and then we gorge ourselves over lunch. Sounds like my kind of group. I know where to find you. (Karina) The books I ordered came in so I thought I'd swing by Lena's and drop 'em off to save her a trip. I should be home within the hour. (Ryan on phone) 'No rush.' - Okay, bye. - 'Bye.' [thuds] [cat meows] [intense music] [line ringing] (Lena on voicemail) 'Hi, it's Lena. Sorry I missed your call. Leave a message.' [woman screaming] (woman on phone) '911. What's your emergency?' Yeah, hi, I'm at 1-1-0-3-0 Woodland Avenue. There's an incident, uh, an altercation, maybe. I think my friend's in trouble. - 'Are you inside the home now?' - No, I'm-I'm in the car. I just saw a man go into the house. I, I think I hear them struggling. 'Officers are on their way, ma'am.' 'Please stay inside your vehicle.' Thank you. [indistinct chatter] - 'Right now!' - 'Lena, Lena..' (male #1) 'Lena, put that down.' [indistinct chatter] 'Lena, put that down!' [indistinct chatter] [indistinct yelling] (Lena) 'It is none of your business. Keep her out of this.' (male #1) 'Okay. You have to stop. Lena, no, put that down.' 'Put that.. Lena, no, no! No.' (Lena) 'Get out!' 'Get out! I said get out!' [screams] Sorry. [panting] [intense music] [siren blaring] Karina? Wh-what are you doing here? Lena, I called the police, they're on their way. Lena! Lena, are you okay? Lena! God! Are you alright? I-I heard you scream and there was glass breaking-- It-it was just an unsuccessful burglary, that's all. Well, you did the right thing. Is she okay? She can sleep through an air raid. [chuckles] Lena, why don't I take the couch tonight? No, we're... We're fine. I mean, the police were thorough. There's no reason for you to trouble yourself, really. It's no trouble. It's just, then I'd have to explain why you're here and, you know right now she doesn't know anything's amiss. I would, I would just rather keep everything status quo for now. Understood. What did you tell the police? Exactly what I told you. [scoffs] The same story. I'm surprised they didn't wanna question me. Oh, I'm sure they have bigger emergencies to tend to than this. I mean, I didn't wanna keep them when we're fine. [intense music] (Ryan) So what's your analysis? - What? - Well, is it edible? Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry, babe. I don't mind you being out to lunch but we're currently out to dinner. I know. I just have this bad feeling I can't shake. Can you please try? What if Mallie is in danger? What if she needs our help? Look, we can only be so involved. I mean, I understand that Mallie has an over-active imagination but I don't buy that as an excuse to hide what's going on around her. Would you do that? No, but we're not her parents. Just if something else happens to her and we're-- Your empathy for her is a sign you're gonna be a great mother but we have to let Mallie's mother take care of her daughter her way. I get it. You want me to drop this whole thing. [sighs] Maybe I am misreading it. But if I'm not do you promise that if Mallie's in danger 'we will help her?' (Ryan) Of course. I've always got your back. You know that, right? I know. Thanks. - Eat before it gets cold. - Yeah. (Lena) 'Luckily, they're gonna keep the incident under wraps, so..' (Karina) 'I'm so surprised you think they want to alert the public.' Well, I, I shared with them that I've spent years trying to conceal our whereabouts from my ex-husband and if they ran a story on me all of those efforts would go to waste, so.. So your ex-husband, do you think that he's the one that tried to take Mallie? Oh, it was almost successful when she was a little baby but I'll never let that happen again. So it wasn't him. When's the last time you've.. I've spent so many years off the radar for Mallie's sake it's-it's not natural for me to you know, settle into a community. But you have been just a wonderful gift for us. - Oh, you guys, too. - Don't get me wrong. I mean, the parents here are, are welcoming. It's just they're so involved in everybody's lives, you know it's just, it's nice to have a friendship that isn't forced because, you know, a play date went well. Yeah. So when are you and Ryan getting in the baby-making business? Technically, we already are. What did I tell you? Isn't this the cutest ever? - Oh. - Karina, this is Jenn. We were just talking baby shower registry and I brought her straight over here because you have all this stuff. I mean, all this great stuff. I wouldn't know what to call it. I could've really used this place when I had Dylan. Great to meet you, Jenn. Congratulations. Thanks. And you, too. Emma said you're new here. You know, it's been about a year, but it's taken a million to get settled and to get this place up and running. Well, you've done a great job and now you need to get acquainted here. Do you hike? Yes, I do, but I am more inclined to do so if it's followed by a brunch. - What did I tell you? - She's gonna fit right in. [gasps] Oh. So her husband does all the wood stuff and she does all the dresses. You're kidding.. Wow! So talented. Idea. So I'm hosting Jenn's baby shower. What do you think if we have it here? I mean, we can move all the middle stuff out and have the food over there. I mean, it would be great exposure for you and you get to meet everyone. I love it. You know, that sounds like fun. Just let me know what I need to do to help. She said yes. - You don't mind? - I love the idea. - That is amazing. - Unique, right? I'm tired of the same old shindig. [instrumental music] Since we're here, um, we could actually do these things as parents, you know? We could. Is it weird that we don't have a kid? We're going through the motions. It's so easy, we just.. Speaking of that, wait, wait. I have to go. I told Lena that I would go check on Mallie's dress before the ceremony started. Okay? Sounds good. Do you want me to save you a seat? Yes, please. I'll be right back. [gasps] Mallie, you look so beautiful! Are you excited to read your book to everyone? (Mallie) 'Can I read Karina my favorite part now?' Oh, honey, uh, you, you h-had the book. You had it in the car. I had to carry my bag with both hands. 'And my dress is too tight.' N-no problem. I saw a couple of copies at the front desk. I can watch Mallie if you wanna go get it. - Okay. Are you sure? - Of course. Okay, hon, remember, you're my most precious thing in the world, okay? Turn around. Let me see. Uh-oh! I know what the problem is. You've been doing some growing. I just knew what was happening. Mm-hmm. I'm just gonna stick my hand right underneath here. - Okay? - Okay. Oh, what's this? What happened? Oh, that's just my ugly spot. Honey, no part of you is ugly. The ugly goes away when I keep the Band-Aid on it. Oh, I see. Band-Aids help things heal. Does it hurt? No. It's been there as long as I can remember that I forget. Like a birthmark or a freckle? No. Just a spot that no one is supposed to see. That's why my mom puts a Band-Aid on it. Hey. Every part of you is perfect, okay? I don't want you hiding any part of yourself. I think what you're saying is true. Unless you're playing hide and seek. [chuckles] Mallie, I think that you're right. Let's see if we can fix this dress. And that's one of the things I love about this book which I recommend to everyone and even their dogs. [laughing] (Karina) 'And that is our last recipient' of Willow Elementary's Eager Reader Award. Let's give them all a hand. [applauding] Okay, it's picture time. [dramatic music] Hey. Hey, hey, hey, where are you goin'? Don't you wanna get your picture taken with the group? Where do you think the picture will be? Maybe in the newspaper. For everyone to see? Even people that don't live here? - Probably. - Will our names be in there? Maybe. You know, I've always wanted to be in the newspaper. Mom's not gonna like it, though. Why not? She doesn't like us taking pictures. Oh. Well, we better not, then. Hey, how about I see if I can still get your name in? - Would you like that? - Yeah. - We're gonna take off. - Oh. They're just gonna do a picture. But.. [intense music] (Emma) But let your kid take a school picture, am I right? (Karina) 'What do you mean?' Mallie doesn't do a picture day. [screams] (Karina) 'I called the police they're on their way.' She, um, told me her name used to be Emily. [laughs] Really? Oh, what's this? What happened? Just a spot that no one is supposed to see. [doorbell ringing] - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Um.. W-well, since you guys left so quickly the other day uh, uh, Mallie didn't get her book. - And I, I brought you this. - Thanks. - Come on in. - Thank you. [dramatic music] Emma came by my shop the other day and, uh, she brought Jenn. She was just glowing, it was really great, um.. And they invited me on a hike on Sunday. Have you ever went hiking with them? No. Actually, I haven't. Just some things don't make sense to get a sitter for. - So.. Thanks. - There you go. Um, Ryan and I are happy to watch Mallie for you any evening that you wanna go out. We're, uh, we're okay. Lena, about the group photo yesterday.. Are we okay? Uh, sure. I just, I mean, uh.. Sorry, I was.. What? You know, I, uh.. Mallie wouldn't take her medal off. You must be so proud. She's a good kid. I'm lucky. Do you...ever wish that her dad was still in the picture? No, we're.. We're fine on our own. Do you mind me asking what happened? [chuckles] Well, there's really nothing to share. We, uh.. We just moved forward. Why don't you let her take a picture, Lena? Why don't you stay out of this? I'm just concerned. You know, if you are hiding from something you can let me know. I-- Excuse me? How dare you suggest I'm hiding something? - I didn't say that. - No? You're not a parent. You could do me a favor. Stop trying to parent my child. Okay? That's not what I'm doing. - No? - No, I am concerned. - Mallie has told me something-- - Mallie is a child. You have, you don't have any business talking to a child without their parent there. I mean, she is a kid. Kids say things.. I mean, come on. Especially kids who read a lot of books. - I mean.. - I know. And I am not a parent and I have no idea what you've been through. But I want you to know that I am here if you need me. What I need right now.. ...is for you to leave. [intense music] [door shuts] [bird cawing] [shattering] [laptop keys clacking] [dramatic music] Are you Karina Harlow? I am. Uh, come in. We were visited by a Lena Colbert. - Do you know her? - I do. Well, Ms. Colbert's requested to file a restraining order against you. Why? What did I do? 'According to Ms. Colbert, there's been' some inappropriate behavior regarding her daughter. Like what? That's crazy. Did you tell her that her daughter was taken by a man while the child was in your care? Well, yes. 'Were you outside of her home' 'when you thought you saw a man enter' 'and you took it upon yourself' to call the police? 'Did you gift her daughter with several items' 'including a custom-made dress' 'that you later made alterations to' while it was on the child, with no other adults present? That's not how it happened. That's not how it happened at all. This is not right. Ms. Colbert is feeling very uncomfortable with the multiple false scenarios that you've created and embellished on with no actual evidence that they've occurred. I didn't make any of this up. Well, you've attempted to involve the authorities on more than one occasion, all of which Ms. Colbert feels 'are the product of delusional paranoia.' 'Now her daughter has expressed discomfort as well.' Did you even talk to Mallie? If we do go through with serving you you'd have to appear in court. I know that might not be the best thing for a business that caters to minors so she has agreed to a polite warning. She's not right. You have to talk to her about her daughter. - She is hiding something. - Ms. Harlow. If I have to speak with you again it'll be in regard to a court-ordered appearance. Respect her wishes. Have a good day. Is everything alright? No. Should I be worried? Lena's trying to cast suspicion on me so they don't suspect her. (Lena) 'I know I have a tendency to keep to myself' and I hope it doesn't insult you or your efforts to include me. It's just, being a single parent is.. [sighs] ...it's hard. Of course. We're here if you ever need a hand. Actually, that's why I wanted to, um, talk with you guys and.. I don't wanna start any problems or.. But Mallie has, has said some things to me and I just, I can't, I can't ignore it. [sighs] Mallie has shared that there have been some things that have made her uncomfortable. And again, I don't, I don't want to jump to any conclusions or cast anyone in a bad light but, you know, she's, she's my kid. Of course. What happened? It's Karina. I would really appreciate your help in ensuring Karina keeps her distance from Mallie. Did she do something to Mallie? She can be a little aggressive in her urges to parent my child. And I just.. I feel a line has been crossed. T-thank you. I-I'm sure this wasn't easy. I just, I felt as a parent.. ...you had a right to know. You have our support. [cell phone ringing] It's Karina. - That's uncomfortable. - Right? [sighs] It's so sad. This couple that has a business that caters to children.. ...they can't have a child of their own. Just breaks my heart. Hey, so I don't want to alarm you or anything but there's been a man hanging around here. Uh, he was in a blue Jeep and.. Just keep a close eye on her. Are you kidding? I had Maya the same month that little Emily went missing. We flew out of Copeland County as soon as I recovered from my C-section. I'll never shake that. Emily? That little girl that was kidnapped. About five years ago. What a nightmare. [sighs] Have a good one. (man on video) 'Please, we beg you.' 'Return our little girl.' [woman sobbing] If anyone has seen anything or knows any information.. '...please..' She has a birthmark. Right here. Tragedy strikes in Copeland County this morning as a married couple was killed in a car crash just south of the I-45 bridge. Lacy and Tom Worthington were on their way to the airport at around 6.30 a.m. says the Copeland County sheriff's office when their vehicle lost control and flipped upside down. 'The couple was killed instantly.' 'This news comes almost two years after' 'the late couple's daughter was abducted from their home.' Tom and Lacy leave no surviving family. 'But friends mourning at the crash site say' 'they were inspired by the couple's tireless search..' Ryan, you have to see this. This Emily Worthington would be nearly eight and Mallie is nearly eight as well. And they're both blonde-haired, blue-eyed. I hate to say it, but so are most of the other little girls that go missing, and Emily is a pretty common name. And what about the car crash? [intense music] But this girl was taken right out from under her mom's nose. Right from her bedroom in Copeland County. And she has a birthmark. - Who? Mallie or Emily? - Both. Mallie has a spot on her shoulder that Lena makes her cover with a Band-Aid and Emily had one on the back of her shoulder in the same area. Well, could Mallie have heard this story somewhere and just kinda made it her own? I don't think so. She was three when this happened. Wow, I don't know. You're gonna have to talk to Lena about this. Well, if I ask too many questions she just might pick up and disappear with Mallie somewhere untraceable. Well, once you make an accusation like this you can't come back from it. Start with Lena before you do or say anything to anyone. I just have to do right by Mallie, you know and she doesn't want me anywhere near them. And now I know why. [cell phone vibrating] Hey, Jenn, what's going on? Hey there, so I really appreciate you offering to host the shower, it's just, the more I think about it I'm starting to feel like a hot-air balloon and I think I just wanna keep it intimate and easy. Yeah, of course. Yeah, We're just gonna do it at my house with family and a few close friends. I don't want a fuss. I totally understand. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help. (Jenn) 'Thanks. You take care.' You, too. Lena's already going after, uh, my new friends. What do you mean? The friends that I just made, they're pulling away. I'm not backing down. Okay, I support that but she's actively going ahead of you to discredit you. Are you really up for that kind of a fight? I have to do right by Mallie even if it costs me my reputation. Maybe go around Lena. You know, enlist the help of someone who isn't in the circle. You're right. (Karina) Hey, Cam, can you meet me? It's urgent. (Karina) 'I'm just trying to figure out why she would wanna' keep this burglary quiet. I mean, I would wanna get this guy, right? Well, by the sound of the bleeding, I mean, she got him. Maybe that's the reason why. Maybe. And I went to the local library to find out what I could on Emily Worthington case. There wasn't much, she's from a small town there wasn't a lot of coverage on it, but.. ...I found this picture of her. This is her, this is Mallie. That's quite a striking resemblance. You know what, can you send that to me for reference? Of course, of course. And would you mind presenting this to the authorities? I just don't think that they would take me seriously right now. Absolutely. (Emma) Karina? Sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to say thanks again for your offer for Jenn's shower, but.. I know. Jenn called me. Well, I'll see you around. (Emma on phone) 'Karina was having lunch with some woman' 'showing her a picture of Mallie.' 'It was so strange, when I came over, she hid the picture.' 'I was sure she was up to something' so I waited and got her friend's license plate number. I have a friend at the DMV who gave me her address. I think you should go and talk to her and figure out what's really going on. [intense music] [music continues] [music continues] [Cam humming] [sighs] [coughing] 'Oh.' [groans] [sniffles] [dialing] [line ringing] (woman on the phone) '9-1-1. What's the emergency?' [air hissing] 'Hello?' I'm sorry, I-I just felt like I took too much of a break today and I need to catch up. I left you some food on the counter. Aw, thanks. I'll be home in a bit. (Ryan on phone) 'Well, I'll try to wait up for you.' Uh, no, that's okay. I'll snuggle into bed next to you. [sighs] Alright. Love you. You, too. [intense music] [grunts] (woman on PA) 'Paging Dr. Roth, please report to Emergency immediately.' [groans] Hey. - Hey. - Hey. Um.. Help me get this out. - No, sweetie. - We have to go. No, no, the doctor said if you hadn't turned your head when you did, this could have been fatal. I'm fine, I promise. We have to go. Honey, no. The police think that this was a robbery. It was not a robbery, Ryan, please. Honey, Look at me. Look at me. This was a really close call. You've been in some really dangerous situations lately. Okay, it's time to take a step back. Please. [cell phone vibrating] That's weird. Hello? Yes, this is she. Oh, my gosh. Is she okay? (woman on PA) 'Will the orderly on duty please come to reception?' Hey. Love ya. I couldn't ask for a better friend. I'm so sorry. Karina. I couldn't protect her. I can't even protect myself. Hey, you couldn't even if you wanted to. How am I gonna protect Mallie? Okay, these incidents they are unfortunate, but they are unrelated. Do you honestly believe that? Because I'm not gonna be able to forgive myself if I don't do something. Okay, that may be, but you shouldn't do anything without the help of the authorities. They're not going to listen to me or you. We have to push forward. We can't handle this, we're not equipped, we need their help. The police think that I'm a danger to Mallie. They've already threatened to slapped me with a restraining order. Why would we waste our energy trying to convince them that they're wrong when we can use that to help Mallie? Sweetie, you're upset. Okay, I know this is very difficult to see Cam like this but, sweetie, please, I need you to think clearly. Is that really, really the best choice of action? [scoffs] [indistinct announcement on PA] Lena's not well. I know it. And if she's mentally unstable, then she needs to get help. We have to think about Mallie here, someone has to because if Mallie is Emily then we have to be sure, you know? I mean, one day we might have a Mallie and if she's in trouble, wouldn't we want someone to do everything that they can to help her? Okay, okay, I just think we're entering territory here neither of us know how to navigate. I know that you're scared, I'm too, but we have-- Do what, exactly? The man that tried to take Mallie or the person that was at their house that night they may have been involved in the Emily kidnapping or they can know something about Lena. Okay, I don't want you doing that alone. I can start by reviewing the security-cam footage from the day that Mallie was almost taken. Maybe I can ID him or his car-- Karina. And I won't do anything else without you. Now can we please get me cleared to leave here? (woman on phone) 'One minute please, ma'am.' That's why I'm so surprised he didn't report it. I.. My son said that he scraped the side of the car pretty bad. The poor man's probably worried about how much this is gonna cost him. That's exactly why I wish he had left a note and.. I'm just trying to teach my son responsibility for his actions that's why I want him to call the man and properly report the damage and apologize. Can you get me a number? (woman on phone) 'I found a similar Jeep under an Ivan Serling.' Ivan Serling. (Ivan) I know she's dangerous. I was trying to get Mallie away from her. I thought you were trying to kidnap her. No, I understand that in retrospect but you don't know my wife like I do. - I had to take the chance. - Lena's your wife? Technically, yeah, but I haven't seen her in years. For the last week, like I said, I've been tracking her to try to save Mallie from her. How long have you been tracking her? Oh, her real name is Isabelle Redder. I searched every county court in the state for her name change and a few weeks ago I finally got lucky. And it was here. One day I saw her, but she was with a little girl. For a brief second, I lost it, I thought "What if that little girl was mine?" You know, m-maybe she didn't wanna raise a child with me and so she tried to kill me.. Then I came to my senses and I-I realized w-what's bothering me is that she looks so familiar and not because she may be my daughter. A few days before she left me we went by this park and.. ...she was fixed on this little blonde girl about three years old. Said it reminded her of her littler Abby, you know the one who was taken from her. Where were you living at the time? Copeland County. I think that toddler might be Mallie. I knew she was violent. But kidnapping? I never thought that she'd be capable of such a thing. But I-I.. I don't know anymore. You should try to understand that Lena wasn't always this way. It's because of what happened to her when she was a child. Isabelle, or Lena gave birth at 16 but Lena's doctor diagnosed her as having a mental illness and that meant she was incapable of safely raising a child. (Ivan) She refused to give that baby up for adoption. She ran away with the baby. Her doctor told the Department Of Children And Family Services who came and took the child from Lena. This was your child as well? No, no, this was years before I met Isabelle. Her daughter is in her twenties by now raised by a, a loving family, we're told. You need to tell the police what really happened. What's the point? They won't believe me. She's too dangerous. (Ivan) 'Who knows what could happen?' 'And think about what she can do to Mallie.' [door chim[door chimes ch] [intense music] You made a terrible mistake. [grunts] [gasps] I will do anything for my daughter. [screaming] [groans] [panting] [intense music] [music continues] (Mallie) And if you all don't mind, I would love for you guys to try my newest recipe. It only takes a few moments for the magic powers to mix it. Abracadabra. (Lena) 'Mallie, come on, it's time to go.' - But I have guests. - Don't argue with me. - Five more minutes? - Say goodbye to your friends. - Now. - Okay. Psst. Mallie. - Karina. - Shh, shh, shh, shh. [shushing] You came just in time for tea. - I'm so lucky. - Come in the yard. Actually, I was wondering if, uh, you wanna come with me. If I come with you, can I at least have a tea party? Of course, sweetie, of course, you can but you can only come if you feel comfortable. I think maybe I would like to go to your house. Okay, great. Come on, let's go. (Mallie) 'Are you going on a trip?' No, actually, we-we're kind of on a trip right now. This is my best friend's house and she's not here, so we're watching it for her. So it's kinda like having two houses. Fun, huh? Yeah. Karina, I need to use the restroom. Okay, go ahead, it's right in there. What if Lena goes to the cops? She wouldn't risk it a second time. How can you be sure? How can she report her child missing if her child is actually a missing child? Okay, the way we're going about this, it looks really bad. Like, we're taking a child as well. What? We didn't have a choice. She was gonna leave with Mallie. We were never gonna see her again. Mallie is Emily. No one's gonna care how we prove it. And how are we gonna prove that? Well, Lena attacked me at the store. I can go and get the video surveillance of it. Wait, Lena attacked you at the sore? Ryan! You promised me that you would do this. Please. - Right, I'm going with you. - No. Mallie, hey, can you do me a huge favor and, uh, take care of Ryan? 'Cause I gotta leave for a little bit. Oh, sure. I think he might need a hair cut. I think you're right. Sit right down here, sir. [chuckles] Okay. [laughs] So where did you learn how to do this? Some things people just have a natural talent for. Well, you are very talented at it. I miss my daddy. Yeah? Thank you for bringing me here. I really like having you here. [instrumental music] [intense music] [sighs] Oh, no, Lena. [cell phone vibrating] [intense music] [automated message] '...to an automatic voice message.' Ryan! Ryan! Damn it! Ryan! Mallie! Oh, my God, Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! [groans] Mallie's gone. Call the cops. [groans] [siren blaring] He's stable, but it's best we keep him overnight. The doctors would wanna run some tests. Uh, we've notified the police, so expect a call. Get some sleep and you can visit him in the morning. Okay, let me know if anything changes and I'll come right over. We will. - Any change. - We will. [intense music] [music continues] [sighs] My purse. (Karina) 'My sister and my niece are staying with you.' I was wondering if you could tell me if they've checked in yet. My sister is staying with you and I was wondering if you could tell me if she's checked in yet. My niece, she's seven, she's got blonde hair and.. Yes, I understand that information is private, but.. I understand, I understand, I was just wondering if I could give you the make and model of their car and you can tell me if you've seen it? Can you tell me if our car is still there? I-I, I just don't know if she's left to come pick me up yet.. The license plate number is 3-D-H, that's all I know. It's California plates, though. It.. Yeah, yeah, I can wait. It is? Well, um, th-thanks so much, um. Actually, my mom just texted me and she was, like, in the shower when I called. Okay, thanks a ton. Bye. [intense music] [music continues] (Lena) 'Mallie, are-are you ready? Do you have all your stuff?' - 'Think so.' - 'Mallie.' (Lena) 'Gather up your things, okay? - 'Mom, you said--' - 'Come on, honey, let's go.' - 'What's wrong?' - 'Sweetie, grab your..' (Lena) 'Grab your bag. The car's here.' [indistinct chatter] Mallie, let's go! Mallie. Honey, hurry, come on. [car engine starts] Seatbelt. No, no, no! (Mallie) 'Mom, where are we going?' (Mallie) Mom, why are we moving again? (Lena) 'Honey, please stop asking so many questions.' (Mallie) 'Mom, why are we moving again?' (Lena) 'Oh, I'll tell you what, let me find somewhere to pull over' 'and I'll tuck you in so you could get some sleep.' 'Is that okay?' Ivan. I need your help. [cell phone vibrating] Isabelle Redder? I'm sorry, you have the wrong number. (Karina on phone) 'I know it's you, Isabelle.' 'I'm sorry about Abby.' I'm sorry they took her from you. And I want to help. - Please let me help. - Stay out of this, Karina. You took Abby to the overlook to see the city 'and that's the last time you saw her.' That.. That's not what happened. You wanted her to see the lights. I bet you can't go there without thinking about her. Lena? [engine starts] Hey there. Hardly any cars have passed through. Well, we only need one. This was the spot. I took her here more than once and she would just sit here staring at over the city whispering to herself. Thanks again for doing this. Listen, I'm gonna park my car up there, out of sight. All I need for you to do is to distract her long enough for me to grab Mallie. Okay? [engine revving] Anything? Not yet. Wait, wait.. I do. It's a gray sedan. (Karina) 'That will be her.' Uh, what if she sees me and bolts? Lay low until she gets out of the car and then you approach her. 'Can you see a little girl with her?' No. Not from here. Keep me on speaker, okay? Don't hang up. You got it. [intense music] You always loved to come up here and look at the city lights. Don't think I didn't expect to see you here. Isa, I have missed you. I know you have missed her, but.. ...you have to stop running. Ivan. Don't make this harder than it has to be. I agree. - Look, let's just start fresh. - She's not yours. - And I'm not giving her up. - Who? [scoffs] I'm not stupid, Ivan. Is there someone in the car with you? If there were, do you really think I would let you near her? We can be a family. I'm not falling for this, Ivan. [dramatic music] What, you, you surprised? - Look, you are not gonna-- - Oh, I am. - Because I have to. - Put the gun down. You know why? Because you will never stop looking. Please put the gun down. - She will never stop looking. - Please. It's over, Ivan. Lena! No! [gunshot] [groans] God.. Help! Help! - Karina! - Help! Ivan! Ivan? - Can you hear me? Are you okay? - 'No.' (Ivan on phone) 'No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm shot.' Karina? You're something else. I trusted you. I let you into our home 'into our lives.' This is about what's right for Mallie. This is what's best for Mallie. [grunting] It is not what's best for Mallie. You don't know what's best for her. - I'm her mother! - It's not! You're dangerous! - She's not safe! - She is safe with me! - I'm her mother! - Ah! What? You didn't uncover that in your research? Huh? Yeah, that's 'cause I'm good. And I'm an even better mother 'and I will do anything for my Mallie.' [grunts] - '911. What's your emergency?' - 'Hello. I need help.' (Karina) 'She has a gun.' 'Track my phone. I..' Ivan. Ivan, are you okay? It's okay, help is on the way. - Okay? - Karina! Lena, you have to stop running. You have to stop hiding. You have to give Emily up. You still have a chance for a relationship with Abby. Don't you want a relationship with her? [siren blaring] It's too late for that. That's not what she told me. - W-what? - We found her. [siren blaring] It's time to stop hiding. Please put down the gun. Police. Put the gun down! Slowly put the gun down and step back. Please put down the gun. (male #2) '...gun down, ma'am.' 'Ma'am, put the gun down.' It's okay. [instrumental music] [music continues] [no audio] [Mallie slurping] Do you want a cracker? Who else needs a cracker? Yum-yum yum-yum. [Mallie humming] - Emily. - Yeah? Come on out front, Ryan and I wanna talk to you. Okay. Bye. Whoa! Emily, we have something very important to tell you. Well, what is it? Well, we just found out this morning.. That you're getting a baby sister. My own baby sister? I love you. We love you, too. Thank you for everything. Thank you. [laughing]
