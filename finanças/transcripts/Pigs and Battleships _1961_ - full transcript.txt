I'm speaking the truth, so that your mother won't worry. What did you say? How can you teach others in this way? What did you say? What do you mean? I said you should teach her like that. You can't teach her to marry someone for money. Every person has his own choice, And none of them should be taught to make choices for money. What's wrong here? What do men like you actually know About pain of our women. No! in my opinion I've never met a people like you. You don't know the situation at all But you still teach others to do everything.

And how can I do it right? Husband Are you OK? Haruko Haruko don't think too much. You need not to care what sister have said just now. Marriage without love will make no happiness.

Keep it. Just keep it. Haruko What's your problem? Where have you been? I've been looking for you for a long time. I want tell you, we! Could you say it later? Brother may be dead. There are likely another 3 monthes. So we need to treat him better. It's unbelievable. You will be like this in the future. It's just a matter of time. As long as you go on being together with whose people, And you never consider about your future. It'll be too late when you want to save the situation. Mr. Yoshimiya say so as well. Why did he tell you this? He said he'll give me money that you can't afford. Why did you take his money? I refused him. But It's absolutely none of your business. I won't mind it, and I can't mind it. You make choice as you like. You can do anything as you like. don't bother about me at that time. I'll never bother about you, Even you are dead. Is it?
