No, put Carlos in front, you go in back! And talk to him, get him to say something. Whatever it is, get him to talk. What do I say to him? I don't know. Víctor. Whatever you want! Damn, he's a kid. Shut up and snap out of it! Don't you go to sleep too! -Nothing will happen to him. -Don't leave me alone! Don't take him to my place. My mother can't see him! Fuck! Call Nora, she always knows what to do. Carlos, wake up, wake up... Fuck! Fuck! Nora, Nora. Fuck, Carlos! Talk to him! Víctor? Tell me. Víctor. Let's go to your house. Take me to your house. Carlos, don't fall asleep. Wake up. Tell me anything. Whatever it is. You talk! No, you, please. -Talk to him! -Víctor, you talk to him. Talk! Do something! Snap out of it! I can't. Fuck, fuck! Do something! SANTA ANA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL Where's Abel? At my place. But he's... You're going to help me, Víctor. I can't do anything. If only I could. Yes, you can. UNBRIDLED SIX YEARS LATER THURSDAY Good morning. Good morning. Political corruption has marked the days prior to a historic investiture session. The People United candidate, Abel Ruiz, states that he will fulfil his campaign promise and that his first goal at the head of the Andalusian Government will be to put an end to political corruption. Ruiz does not want the return of the scandals like those of the top advisor of the ex-government of Andalusia, Gonzalo Alarcón, in prison... -Can you stop for a moment, please? -Here? Yes. Just for a moment. ...and diverting public funds to a "B account". All this indicates that there will be no surprises and the foreseen scenario will see Abel Ruiz named as the new Andalusian president in four days, thus breaking the traditional two-party system. Despite maximum support in the ballot boxes, the opposition is on a war footing due to Ruiz's controversial past. The People United candidate has been surprisingly candid for our political class and has not hidden his struggle against the ghosts of his past. INCOMING CALL - UNKNOWN Abel Ruiz once again shows his willingness to change our country's tainted politics, working for all Andalusians... Lady, I can't stay in the middle of the road. -Do we go or stay? -Yes, let's go. ...pledges to be transparent and showing this commitment... A CHANGE FOR ANDALUSIA PEOPLE UNITED WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU Abel, I'm just saying that this report is no joke. It's the first time that such a major medium, plus that fucking Sunday rag that everyone reads, have recognized that this is history and doesn't treat us like the idiot brother of the usual bunch. And on the cover, shit. I mean that it wouldn't be bad if this weekend at your house there was someone trusted with this photographer, just in case. Just in case? In case of what? In case things deviate from the party and focus on things that are nothing to do with what we've achieved. And that no one gives a shit about. It's important... Everyone already knows about all that, Martín. Abel, you've got better approval than the Secretary General, and three years ago we didn't even exist. You were wasting away at that university teaching some brats how to do things, and now you're doing those things. I know this is just the start, but we have to get it right and this report is a huge fucking opportunity. THE "NEW FACE" OF ANDALUSIA Gee, Martín, they did a good job today, we can't deny them that. Yes, I saw the photo this morning. I don't know where the bastards got it. Fear makes them rummage through the trash. What's this? I've been doing my job, trying to understand why you're so interested in him doing the photos. And what do you think? About the photos or your interest? Félix is an old friend of mine, and of Nora's. From when? It's a good time for bad friends. Félix is different. One of the few decent people in that period. The photos are good, too good in my opinion. But they're good. He's good. What Félix wants will only come about if we're alone. Plus, it was the deal with the paper. Two mutts that shared a doghouse that nobody had any hope for and who finally got out and made something happen in the world, each in his own way. And they see each other again to talk about it. The two of them alone. Here. No, you keep it. I just wanted to take a look. And you should look for an apartment downtown to make life easy for everyone. Yes. Anyway, I can always sleep on your sofa, right? If Tino lets you, it's fine by me. -Your cat is a son of a bitch. -He sure is. -He hates me. -He hates you. Good, that way you're ready for what's coming at you on Monday. Bastard. Go fuck yourself. Right. See you later. Blondie. Hi. You taste bitter. The coffee. Go on, help me. I got my dad's old room ready for Félix. This heat's crazy and the sun doesn't hit it until the afternoon. He'll be better. -I really want to see him. -Me too. It's been so long... I left the building plans for the bedrooms on your desk. You have to tell me if you want parquet or if we leave the tiles as they are. Up to you, Nora. Whatever you say is fine. I prefer to keep the tiles and give them a good acid bath, so the house doesn't look so strange to me. That's just fine. Do you know who came this morning asking for you? You'd just gone. Virginia... Illescas, is that her name? Dark hair, always went with you to El General. She was an actress, right? Yes, and what did she want? She was visiting Seville and wanted to say hi to you. I'll call her later and see if I can catch her. Are you alright? Yes, just a bit spaced out from this humidity. If you don't want to, don't call her. Do what you like. No, it's not that. I'll see later. She said she wanted to go take a look at El General. You didn't tell her it'd closed? Yes, I told her that since they opened the new freeway there's nothing there. She then said "congratulations" and left. A real weirdo. I'm going to lie down upstairs for a while. You eat and tell me when Félix arrives, okay? -I'll tell you. -Okay. I went to Rosa's this morning and bought some flowers for your brother. I left them in your office. If I can I'll take them. Please... If I can I'll take them. I told Félix I'd devote the whole weekend to him and his report. It's no joke, eh? At least call your parents and tell them I forgot to buy them. Your mother's always saying the niche never has any flowers, that they get stolen. I'll do it this evening. I promise. Go get some rest. What's up, ugly? How are you, handsome? It's luck. Remember the photo of the president with the Nazi mustache? When I took the photo I didn't realize that just then something was making a shadow there on his mustache. I was fascinated by our president's cold sores, which were all gooey. Looked like a toad to me. -Gross. -I was fascinated. So I clicked and, well, and I got a 50,000-euro prize for an accidental Nazi shadow on the president's gob. 50,000 big ones. That photo was a hit everywhere. They even made T-shirts of it. That's hitting the top in my profession. No shit. He's a lucky fucker, I've always said it. Yes. Abel, not at the table. Just a moment. Abel. Sorry. It was Martín. We're to invite Alberto Gómez and his wife to the party. You invite them if you like, I don't know them at all. And it's a friends thing, not a work thing. Now you have friends in that sewer? There are some left of all those sewer rats. You should start with that pearl in Monday swearing-in speech. Yes, the media would love it. The media will love whatever you say. Alright, alright... Besides, now they'll be working for you, right? Who? Your friend, Víctor Alarcón. "Don't know, no answer". Doesn't he still run the coven? -What's "the coven"? -Nothing. Félix, what is it? The private hunting estate of the Alarcón family. Jeez... It's the Board of Public TV and Radio. Anyway, Víctor's still there, where his dad put him, right? But now he's at the service of the good guys. "Don't know, no answer". Alright. THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV DOSTOYEVSKY FRIDAY Why did you devote yourself to politics? My mother served in the Alarcón family house for over thirty years. In precisely the last year, Gonzalo Alarcón was advisor to the Junta. She didn't tell me, but she'd watch the TV in the living room from a wicker chair in the kitchen. When she was in the Alarcón family house, I mean. We didn't even have a TV. She'd take the chair to the door and watch the TV from a distance while she did what she had to do. That was how she saw Massiel win Eurovision, sitting in a wicker chair, folding clothes. She loved Massiel. I only saw her like that once. One night I had to stay with her. She didn't even look at me, out of shame I imagine, or dignity. My father always told me that shame and dignity are two problems of houses with no money. Well, that night, my mother sat me on her knees and we both stayed there, in the kitchen, in silence, watching the TV yards away. I remember that Mayra's "One, Two, Three" was on. That's why I devote myself to politics, for the people who have to sit in those chairs. FOR SALE Wait, please. I won't be long. The meter's still on. It doesn't matter. Wait for me. -Thanks. -Alright. Shit. Hello. Víctor, can we do this some other time? Impossible. I'm sorry. Please. What's wrong? Nothing. Did you come with someone? No, in a taxi, as usual. What's that car? It looks familiar. Abandoned, like everything here. Here. Thanks. Would you mind...? You want the receipt? I have to ask you something, Nora. It's important. I have to go, Víctor. Give it to me, please. It'll just be a moment. We'll get into the car if you like. I just need to tell you something, then you can go with your receipt. I haven't had much time lately to clean it. I don't care. No. You do. You won't even put your back on the seat. What do you think is in there? Bedbugs? Do you know it was Abel who brought me here the first time? "We're going get hooked on this place", he said. He dragged me and stayed up for almost two days, not leaving the bar, not knowing what time it was. We had a great time here. Pity the party always ends. But you were the friend of the son in the family. Víctor and I were kids when my mother served at the house of his family. I suppose making friends was inevitable. The house could get very lonely. Let's carry on later, okay? -Are you alright? -Yeah, yeah. All these photos in a row, I'm not used to it. Do that outside. Give me a puff, go on. Are you sure? Give it here. You won't get hooked again and ruin your Jesus Christ image? Fuck off. I missed it, eh? I even miss a good hangover. They're still an option. I imagine so. Aren't you... I don't know... scared that this whole thing will take its toll somehow? No. It's all here. Thanks. Give me the receipt, please. The taxi's waiting and it'll be a fortune. Don't worry about that. I'll pay for your taxi. For the bother of coming here so many years. What's wrong? Isn't it enough? I don't want your money. This is new. It's the same money that saved Abel. Take it, woman. It's nice that... you only need it now for a taxi. You keep it, you need it. Give me the receipt. It just occurred to me that you should send my father a present... in prison. Something to cheer him up, put him in a good mood. He's having a shit time inside, you know? That's what you should do. And put a proper end to your debt. You have to be grateful and good to the people who help you, Nora. I'm even with you and with him. Give me the receipt. It's fair and... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Lying son of a bitch. Don't do this to me, Víctor. Do what? Don't humiliate me in front of Abel. It won't happen if you help me. And you're going to. What do you want? If Abel kicks me out, I'll squeal and it's goodbye to his career. I'm sorry, Nora. Shut up, you're incapable of feeling anything! I asked for that money! He didn't know! -I was the one that... -That what? You didn't ask too much in case the truth hit you in the face! I didn't know! Fuck! I didn't know! That's the truth! A truth nobody will give a fuck about. Call me when you do it. Or write if you don't want to talk, I'll understand. But if I don't find out by Sunday morning, I'll take it for granted that Abel is sticking to his decision. Then I'll take mine. It depends on you and on him. I'm sorry. Nora? Are you alright? Are you alright? What are you doing here? I was on my way home and I suddenly saw your car from the road. I recognized it and asked the taxi driver to stop. I was in the area, just passing through. I called yesterday to warn you. I know, I know. That's why I stopped when I saw your car. Take me home and tell me about it. Sure. Look, Nora gave me that when we got back from Barcelona with what little was left over from her old man's bequest. The rest she spent paying for all the time I was in that clinic. She paid for it all. All of it. Every one of figures living there symbolizes a year further away from the shit. And the lies. People get cured. Then they can cure others. Even in my shitty profession. That's why I'm not scared. I read in the press that Víctor's dad lives in prison like some god. Well... He's even got a flat-screen TV in his cell. Don't act innocent, it doesn't suit you. They don't make life easy for anyone in those places, much less someone like him. In fact, I know that they've given him the odd scare. It works when it wants to. It's alright. Feeling better? Yes, it was just a dizzy spell. My mouth tastes awful. Have you got any mints? You always had them, right? This car's full of trash. Sorry, eh? I'm sorry for not returning your call. Lots of people have been calling lately who hadn't called for ages. Relax, I figured that you didn't know who called. They cut my line, I changed my phone number and... Sure. You look good. I look horrible. I'm fucked up, eh? You do look good, you look like a different woman. Both of us. Both of us are doing just great. See? One bang and it works, like all old stuff. Do you have somewhere to stay while you're passing through? I LOVE YOU - VÍCTOR Come in. No? What? Has your friend Virginia settled in? She's on it. Just as well you didn't want to see her. It wasn't that. I was embarrassed about forgetting she existed all this time. Right. So you pick her up like an injured animal, eh? It'll only be a couple of days. Besides, it'll do me good to have someone help me with Sunday's thing, it's a lot of hassle for me alone. The food, the flowers... But has she come to stay? I don't know, maybe. She was looking after her mother, but I think she died, even though she hasn't said anything. She's so weird... No. She's doesn't like talking much, that's all. She is weird. -You're the weird one. -Me? I saw Víctor today. Where? He was walking down the street. I was in a taxi. He didn't see me. I don't like you taking a taxi every day, as if we were millionaires. We have to present a good image, especially now. And you've got the bus stop, 15 minutes away? He looked a wreck, like someone else, so thin... Yeah? Is it true what Félix said? Will he be in your service now or will you fire him? I don't want to talk about that. But they say he's great at his job. -Great, huh? -That's enough. Okay? Abel, you're different from the others, you believe in people. Not in that kind of people. Maybe you should show it by giving him a chance to change than by kicking him out. What's all this about now? Nothing. I saw him looking so bad... Maybe he's sorry and needs you. He needs me? Or needs your help. Sure, like he helped my brother, eh? Was he here? Was he here and asked you to speak to me? Did he dare to do that, the fucker? -Don't talk rubbish, please. -I'm not talking rubbish. Answer me. Look at me. You look at me. He wasn't here and he didn't ask me for anything. I feel sorry for him, that's all. -You feel sorry for him. -Yes. Like your friend? You feel sorry for her and bring her home. And what do we do with Víctor? Do we whitewash everything he and his family did? Because we feel sorry for them and embarrassed? It was his father! His father put him there, doing what the fuck he liked. Sure, now he's a good guy. Hard knocks taught him that. If Víctor's ruined paying off what his father stole, at least he's not using the people's money. Don't be naïve. Víctor isn't sorry. He's furious because he knows they're taking his bone away. You're not involved in this. You're doing great. Really, I'm proud of you. SATURDAY THIEVES SON OF A BITCH SON OF A BITCH It died three days ago. My mother thinks it flew off and will be back when it's hungry. This way she handles it better. I think I threw it in the trash and forgot about it. Do you smell funny? I don't know, the usual. Wait there. Good morning. Who was it? Nobody. I liked it better before. What? Your hair. When it was short and people thought you were a lesbian. Shit. I forgot that you hate coffee. Do you want some tea? I think I've got some. Or chamomile? Whatever you want, it doesn't matter. I'm asking you, tea or chamomile? Whatever you want, Víctor. It's a quarter after nine. Right. This is what I want. Something we both like. You won't make me drink alone? You owe me. What do I owe you? A toast. To the reunion. Why don't you throw it out? What? I'll water it later. Don't bother. It's dead. It's bad luck. If it's bad luck, I'm sure it's the cause of everything. Are you here for breakfast, Virginia? I just wanted to see how you were. Okay. So you've come to clear your conscience? That's hard for me to swallow, you and I aren't like that. What are you and Nora up to? See? See how easy it is to tell the truth? Don't you feel a lot better? It rang a bell, that car at El General. What were you doing there? What do you want, Virginia? I don't know. -Do you know Nora's been here? -No. But she's scared, I know that. You must be desperate to smell fear on someone. -What did you see? -You tell me. No, you tell me, you're sitting right there, five years after disappearing without a word. Tell me what you want. Is she cheating on Abel? You want money. Then ask Nora, not me. She's much smarter. She knows when to shut up. Get your money from at the good guys' place, not here. There's only useless stuff here. Stuff nobody cares about. Just a little. So you warm up your stomach and don't run off again, which is what you want to do. Víctor. Fuck, Mom! I dreamt about your father. Let me. What are you doing? Who are you? Nobody. She almost never does anything like this, I'm sorry. Leave it, I'll do it, you've done enough. I'm used to it. This is a job for daughters. What daughters leave behind, nobody gives a shit about, right? Is it too hot? Come on, Mom. Got a cigarette? Keep it. Virginia, what were you doing at El General? I drove there without thinking. It's the last place where I had nice memories. I think we should lend support to People United. To what will happen from Monday because Abel Ruiz and his group have shown that another form of politics is possible and that they're going to clean out the corrupt. I'm going to love seeing these opportunists exposed. There's Víctor Alarcón, clinging to a job that was a gift to him on the Board of Public Radio and TV. And that after his father took 6 million in public money allocated for social services! What a scumbag. And his son charging for turning up now and then at the Board and talking crap. I had to chance to interview Abel Ruiz this week and he insists that he'll fulfil all his promises one by one, including the immediate dismissal of any person of responsibility linked to any corruption issue, that is his priority. Priorities change when one begins to rule. Don't forget that Víctor Alarcón and Abel Ruiz were friends. So time will tell if in the end he's able to kick out his drinking buddy. -No. -Yes. I found it. To play this Sunday at the party. He turned the house upside down to find this. What is it? 173 songs in the car from the Barcelona clinic to here. You remember? You're tacky. No, no... Stop it. Put down the fucking camera, this isn't part of the report. This is real life. No, no. Not here. What happened? Nothing, it's nothing. Abel... I'm pregnant. What? Seriously. I didn't want to tell you until I was sure it was all going to be alright. You're really pregnant? This is more important than anything else now, Abel. -More than anything. -Of course. If I can ask you a favor, please... I don't want to squirm every time the phone rings, thinking that something bad might happen to you. I don't want to go through that now, not with this inside me. I won't let anything happen. -Anything can happen. -What do you want me to do? Don't let Víctor lose his job, please, don't replace him. Trust me. What is it with you and Víctor? Nothing. I'm doing it for you. Kicking him out won't make you forget what happened that night. On the contrary, it'll stay there, simmering. You have no idea what happened that night. You don't know. I know that you can't look your parents in the eye. Or go to a niche to lay the flowers I give you. And I don't want Víctor to use that to hurt you. You think that's why I want to kick him out? Because I feel guilty? No, I only... I want to so that I have something to be proud of. Proud of what? Proud of not being afraid of these scum who think they can buy everything with money. Give me that. Víctor, I need more time. Please. I can't. I need to know by tomorrow morning... I'm sorry. CALLING... VÍCTOR It looks good. Your hair. It's hot. It's better like this. May I take some photos? -Of me? -Yes. Where do I figure in your report? No, it wouldn't be for the report. It'd be for me. I like looking at faces that say things. No, mine doesn't say anything. Yes, it does. -You have your story there. -Yeah? And what story is that? I don't know, let me shoot you and we'll find out. It could be good, eh? He knows a lot of people. Maybe someone will see you. Have you had a look at his book? It's around here, isn't it? Yes, I'll find it later. You were an actress, weren't you? I am. It could be a good opportunity. No. I'm sure it would be. Thanks for giving it to me. And it won't cost you a thing. He'd love to do you a favor, right? Sure. Then take the photos whenever you like. -Thanks. -No, thank you. For giving me this opportunity, thank you. In fact, let's toast. To men who give women opportunities. -Go on. -No, no, no. With water it's bad luck and none of us here want that. Where have you got something good to toast with? Your father kept the expensive wine in the cabinet, right, Nora? Well, you must excuse me. I've never understood wines. I just know that the expensive ones are good. Virginia, sit down. Why? Sit down! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm... a moron. I just wanted us to toast to the wonderful men who give women opportunities. We're going to do it. With water... and with balls. Luck doesn't exist, Virginia. Besides, we don't need it now, right? Cheers! -Nora. -What? I'm sorry. I didn't want to upset anyone. Then what did you want? What the fuck did you want? From the road you couldn't see my car at El General. Impossible. I made sure of that myself. I didn't want anyone to see me sleeping there. I was ashamed. Then what are you doing here... if you saw us and chose to hang back? I'm here because you asked me to stay. Because you wanted my help or you wanted me close to find out what I'd seen, I don't know, but you asked me to stay. Here. Go outside. I'll be right out to get some air. I owed Víctor money. That's why we were there. Help me with the table. I needed help and Víctor needed to stop remorse from driving him crazy. Do you remember Carlos? Yes. Abel's little brother, they were always together. I can't place his face right now, but I do recall seeing him in El General. He was always... Drunk. Say 'drunk', hammered like Víctor and Abel. Following the example of the older guys. The boy learned fast. The animals, there were nights when they could barely speak. What happened to him? An overdose, right? That's what I was told, that he died in the hospital. It depends on how you look at it, but yes, he died in the hospital. At the door to Emergencies, thrown out like a dog. Víctor and Abel left him there and got away unseen. It wasn't their fault, the kid was out of control, but they were scared and left him there, alone. Víctor didn't want any scandal blemishing his father. You see the irony there. And Abel... Abel was so wasted that he didn't remember a thing. But Víctor did, he remembered everything. And it was driving him crazy. Then he came to see me. I took advantage of his conscience. I made him feel guilty so he'd give me enough money to leave here and cure Abel, as long as it took. I admitted him to that clinic in Barcelona he talked about, as if it were a trip he was dying to take, but didn't dare because he didn't have the balls or the money. I gave him both of those things. And now Víctor wants it all back. He already has it. All of it, down to the last euro, I swear. I gave it back any way I could, getting it from wherever I could. Some of my mother's jewels are still left. And Abel never suspected a thing. He thinks I used an inheritance from my father that doesn't exist. He couldn't stand me owing Víctor anything. It'd break him inside. He hates him. That way he shakes off his part of the guilt. With hate he's managed to forge ahead. Everyone does what they can and Abel's done it with hate. If you don't owe him anything, what does Víctor want? He's going to be dismissed. He and some other higher-ups. Abel's cabinet doesn't want anyone in public office with links to the previous party, even if they weren't in it. It's a promise they made and they're going to keep it. And Víctor's like a rabid dog, it means taking everything from him. He's going down. And if he does go down, he'll make the loan public. The money was stolen, wasn't it? He's got both our voices in his phone, admitting that he gave me his father's money and I took it... for Abel. I let myself be recorded, like an idiot. Fuck... He seemed to recognize your car. I didn't know you knew each other. I never told anyone. Nora... I can help you. If you help me. I can try to convince him. I think I know how. It has to be tonight. Lourdes wants to go over the outline of your speech, but she'll do it at your party tomorrow. Maybe we can sort out the issue of the change of headline for the Sunday cover. I don't know, it's fine by me. It's counterproductive. "The People's Plunder..." Plunder? What fucking "plunder"? We haven't stolen anything. I need to get across the sensation of legitimacy, not armed robbery. And we may have a slight problem with Mateo. A tweet three years ago, joking about a Jaén councilor, the whores and coke guy. Why? What's wrong? It's kind of nasty. He deleted it. But I wouldn't be surprised if next week screenshots appeared from the Inquisition demanding his head. -And you? -Me what? You're still in time to tell me. Tell you what? Any tweet that got out of hand one night during your "glory days"? Bodies in the basement? You know, those things that later are a huge headache, Abel. Nothing. Is everything alright there? How's the report going? Good, good. It's all fine. Got your "communion suit" ready for Monday? It's right there so I don't forget. Ironed and with glistening sailor epaulettes. That's the way I like it. I'm sending you a message to back up what you have to say in the interview. It's crucial that you say we are the people's discourse. It's very important. It's a semantic thing but this way we bring in the concept that we are the people... I want Virginia to go tomorrow. I don't want her here. If you're going to puke, tell me and I'll stop. What do you care, this is a fucking trash heap. What are you doing? Tomorrow I'll have to get the train to get my car because of you. I'm thirsty. Do you know, last year I had it in my mouth for 7 minutes? 7, exactly. I counted. I don't want to know about it. I don't give a fuck if you don't want to know. Do you know why I didn't pull the trigger? Víctor, you're drunk. Cut it out. Because a friend of my father did the same thing and blew off his jaw, straight onto the office wallpaper. But he didn't kill himself, he was on the floor, not knowing what to do, bawling and trying to squeal like a pig, but he couldn't because his tongue hung to one side. He shat himself. When the ambulance came, the stench was unbearable, but he was alive, conscious. I was scared that the same thing will happen to me. I wouldn't die, I'd just be staring at my teeth on the wall. I was scared of the pain. The smell of my own shit. I didn't pull the trigger, I didn't do anything, as usual. Say it. What do you want me to say? That my mother and I deserved it, all this shit. Yes, we deserved it for making out we didn't know what was going on. If you know that, why do you want me to say it? I stink like a drunk. SUNDAY Abel. It's very early. I'm nervous. Are you alright? Shall I make you some herb tea? No. It's because of tomorrow. I don't know if I'll be able to do it. Of course you will. I'm going to run a little before the heat sets in, to clear my mind. Sleep a bit more. Rest. Martín, it's Víctor Alarcón. No, don't hang up! I can't locate Abel. Listen to me! I'm going to enjoy fucking up your party before calling the press and telling them what Abel is really like. And where he got the money to get cured. Remember Carlos, Abel's brother? The press are going love how he died. ABEL, CALL ME. URGENT. Hello? Oh, hi, Martín. Go ahead. No, he's not here. He's gone out. I don't know, for a walk, I guess. You know he always leave his cellphone everywhere. Yes, I'll tell him when I see him. Martín, is something wrong? Yes, I'll tell him it's urgent, okay. Will I see you soon? 'Bye. What happened? Are you alright? Yes. I'm just clumsy, I'll pick it up. You're leaving? Yes, I'm going now. The newspaper will come for my stuff when it suits you. Tell me where to leave it so it's not in the way. Stay, please... for the party. For Abel. I can't. I don't want to see Abel lose everything he's fought for. What he's achieved is very important. Don't spoil it. Don't take him to my house, my mother's not to see him. To Nora, to Nora! I couldn't do anything. I'm sorry. I only ask one more thing of you. What? Lend me your car. Now. I'll take you wherever you want. Lend it to me. He's scared but he's back. I told you he'd come back when he's hungry. -He'll kill himself if he keeps that up. -Leave him. If he's come back, it's for a reason. Where'd you find him? I told you, he came back by himself. It's another one. I have to go get the car, Mom. Will you be alright? Yes. He's here with us. And that's good. SON OF A BITCH The train for Seville Central will be arriving shortly. I was looking for you. Have you seen my phone? I can't find it. You'll have left it lying around, as usual. Nora. Thank you. For everything. It's a gift for you. Is it true what Martín said? Is it true or not? Fuck, Nora... Víctor was always bragging about all they had... I thought what he gave me was peanuts for him and his dad. -And it was just... -What? Just what? Money... just money. -Just money? -Yes. Money that grows on trees? That scum's money is never just money. It's always something worse. I didn't know what to do and I wanted to help you. But I gave it all back, we don't owe him anything. Don't be ridiculous. That money, that debt, will never go away. No, don't touch me. Don't touch me. I don't want you to touch me! -Listen to me... -No! Shut up! You have no right to say anything! None! So shut up! When the press hears the recording, I'll have to give it all up. I'll be remembered as one more liar, because of you. You're the same as your father. Letting himself be bought by anyone who puts a collar around his neck. You did the same thing. You let Víctor and his father put one on you. And what's worse, they put one on me. That fucker must be enjoying the joke. It's my fault. That's the truth and I don't care who knows. If only. But nobody will give a shit about that truth. Don't you realize? Yes, I'm starting to. Now? It's all over now. You've turned me into what I hate. You've made me weak. If I go, you have options. No, you're not going, Nora. You have to face the consequences of what you've done. Say you did it out of despair, out of ignorance, whatever the fuck you want. But I have nothing to do with it. Say whatever... What'll happen to me when I do? Abel. Not now, Martín. Give me a minute. Víctor's outside, -asking for you. -Where is he? In the hall, alone. Take it easy. I don't want to see you on the Internet tomorrow beating each other up. -Abel. -What the fuck are you doing here? -Get out. -Listen. Abel! Get out or I'll tear your head off, you son of a bitch! There you go. Do what you like with it. I don't want it near me, it's over. Are you going to pop up every time you want money? How many copies do you have? You're poison, just like your family. Look at the way you talk. And you're not even drunk like you were before. Sober and happy to be. No, I have no other copy. You'll have to live with that. Only Martín knows. And you trust him, right? Why? Do you know how scary it is for someone to want you dead? And to think you deserve it? Maybe in a couple of years you'll know how scary it is. -You and I are very different. -No. You and I are exactly the same, Abel. Only your wife gave you a second chance. Go. I forgot. Have a good time. You've got a party, right? -It's a good day to celebrate. -Go. Everything's alright. Nothing's going to happen. I'm glad. You must've had some shitty days. I know now that everything you did was to help me. The same as everything you did for your father. We'll forget. We deserve to. I love you. Abel, I'm leaving. Where are you going? I don't know. Are you listening to yourself? You sound crazy. What about you? Do you hear me? Do you see me? Do you listen to me? You want the woman who sings a cheesy love song like it's all fine. Who says nothing. What do you mean by that? That you're right, that it's no fucking fun anymore having a collar around your neck. I don't want it. All of a sudden, I sing and feel the wind flow over my hands. Everything is different when I look at myself. Now I understand... If the world explodes...
