No, we got enough land. Enough for you, but not me. I'm goin' after that land and you're not gonna stop me. This is my chance to get a ranch for nothing and I'm gonna get it. Ever since I adopted you, Hub you've been a disgrace to the name of Ordley. For the last time I'm tellin' you I'll tolerate no underhanded methods on this ranch. You either change your ways or get out. So, that's the way you feel about it. [dramatic music] [indistinct chatter] You're a little girl on those bags, fella. Come on there. Hurry up! Say, Frayne, that ring leader, Chip Carter's starting trouble again. I'll make an example out of him. And I'll teach the other prisoners a good lesson. Now, send the men on down to work on the dam but keep Carter here in camp. Right. [all clamoring] Why don't you let him alone! You're killin' that boy! - Get back now! - He's only a boy! - 'Let him alone!' - 'Quiet!' (Frayne) 'And one extra, one for sassing your back.' [Chip grunts] [laughs] Well, how was that, Gorman? Yeah, you're gettin' better than ever with your black snake, Frayne. You got what it takes to boss a camp like this. I make 'em or break 'em here. Yeah, mostly break by the looks of that. - Shall I take him down, boss? - Yeah, take him down. And throw him out to the buzzards. His kind ain't no good to me. When you gonna send me some men? Some real men for a change, Duke. Why, with kids like this one we won't finish the dam before rain time. Hub Ordley's yelling for action. You know what that means to us? To get it to him, pronto. Wait'll you see what I send ya next. Five of the huskiest galoots you ever saw. Ah, good, I can use all you can send me. Because we gotta get this dam done so we can get our dues from Ordley. Hey, Butch, take him down and cool him off. Right. Come on. [chuckles] [music continues] [laughter] Well, I guess that'll wake him up, huh? [all laughing] Go on. Get over there! [dramatic music] Don't let him get away! On your horses! [gunfire] [music continues] I'm sorry you killed him, Butch. You know, the citizens been talking about the prison camp lately. We've gotta be careful. Well, if he got into town with those welts on him they'd talk a lot more. Who's that? [instrumental music] He looks like a big, husky guy you can use, Frayne. Yeah. Let's ride down and take a look. They got me, but it, it's better than dying in that rotten hell! [coughs] I got your scheme all figured out. You'll never get away with it. They can't get away with what, kid? You oughta know? You and your bunch of killers! You wait until Holladay gets back. Wouldn't have gone this far if he hadn't gone away two years ago. Say.. Say, you're Tal Holladay, ain't ya? I'll get you into Red Town, there oughta be a doctor there. No. No, it's too late. I.. I'm going fast. Don't go into Red Town though. They'll kill you. [dramatic music] Hello, sheriff. Looks like you're right in time. - Somebody just shot him. - Why'd ya kill him, feller? Well, you must be fooling, sheriff, I-- Murder ain't no foolin' matter. Why'd you kill Chip Carter? Why should I kill him? His father's one of my best friends. Ya, grudge killin', huh? What's your name, cow han-- Shut up, Spane. I'll handle this. - You let me do the talkin'. - You're the boss, Gorman. Just what is your name, feller? Maybe I've heard it before. - Smith J. Brown. - The "J" is for Jail. Get on your horse, I'm takin' ya in. Well, wait a minute, sheriff. You can't railroad me-- I'm doin' it, ain't I? Let me see his guns. Alright, you just take a look at those guns they haven't been fired, that oughta be proof enough that I didn't.. [gunshot] Fired now, Smith J. Brown. Laugh that off your brisket. Here, take 'em, Spane. Climb on that jughead of yours and ride. Judge Barko's sure tough on murderers. Why, you! [dramatic music] Try anymore of your fancy tricks and Red Frayne will build his dam without your help. No, I can use him. Come on, get on your horse. What'd you get this time, sheriff, another wife-beater? Toughest hombre I ever pinched. He killed Chip Carter. Caught him in doing it too. Good morning, Ms. Ordley. 'Just in time to see a real killer' 'before I lock him up.' That's a lie, Gorman, and you know it. Don't believe a word of it, ma'am, it's a frame up. He doesn't look like a killer, Mr. Gorman. You wouldn't make a mistake, would you? I never make a mistake when it comes to law-breakers. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Say, listen, I don't know just what your game is-- That's enough out of you, Brown. Another crack out of you and I'll fix-- Save it until some other time. There's a lady present. You're a Texan, aren't you, Mr. Brown? Yes, ma'am, and proud of it, considering the type of men you have here in the Territory. Shut up, you! I'll have to be leaving, Ms. Ordley. See ya later. (Tal) 'I'll make you regret this, Gorman, when I get outta here.' [Gorman chuckles] When you do get out! Yes, when I do get out. When I get through with you you'll be lucky if you ain't wearin' a wooden box in a six foot two hole Smith J. Brown. Trouble is comin', talkin' about a coffin leads to a killin' every time. My grandpappy talked about building hisself a coffin one mornin' and a Maltese shot him before he got back up the mountain. (Gorman) 'Shut up, you!' You ain't scarin' me none, mister. I ain't shuttin' up for no man. Come inside these bars and I'll mush you up like a Willow Creek wildcat mushes up a skunk. [laughs] Oh, I say, the beggar has a saffron streak. Eh, what? Yeah, he's as yellow as they come. Go on, hop it. Shove off! Come on. Yeah, I'm glad he didn't take me serious. I was running the whizzer on him. Uh, what are you doing here? Well, they call it murder, but I call it a frame-up. What are you here for? Uh, breaking the bank at the, uh, Wet Your Neck saloon. That's if I didn't have all the filthy money in the place. [laughs] Rather, the croupier called me crooked silly ass, and here I am. (Pewee) 'Can't even breathe around this place without gettin' pinched.' Really, why, if I could afford Smith's then I could kill anyone I like. He said I'd be safe from the law in Indian Territory. Uh, by the way, you're an Indian, aren't you? - Hmm. - Thanks, I thought you were. Trouble is brewin', I tell ya. The varmint's eye sees everything. When the varmint's eyes close somebody gonna die. If you wanna know somethin' just look in the varmint's eye. Well, maybe he can tell me why the fella I'm supposed to have killed says "Wait till Tal Holladay gets back." Hey, listen, I'm Tal Holladay. Does that mean anything to you fellows? Does Gorman know you're Holladay? No, I told him my name was Smith J. Brown. Well, keep it dark then. You're wanted on the Texas side of the river for killin' your own father. My father, dead? I've been in Montana for two years, I didn't-- Makes no difference. Posters down there say Tal Holladay's wanted for the killin'. By the way, the Holladay Twisted-T-Ranch used to be yours, didn't it? Used to be? Why, it still is. Well, your father was shot six months ago. A fellow by the name of Jim Cudlow is runnin' the Twisted-T now. He claims it's his. [keys rattling] Come on, you fellas. You're goin' to court. Hurry up! How you gettin' along with the dam, Frayne? Alright, judge, but I'm looking to you for some more men. Well, I'll get 'em. (Gorman) 'We convict six this morning, Your Honor.' What's the charges, sheriff? Spooks Wilkins, sellin' liquor to the Indians. Listen, Your Honor, where I come from it ain't no sin to run off a little cold squeezings and share it with your neighbors. You got any liquor with you right now? No, sir. (Barko) 'Five years of hard labor.' 'Next case.' Pewee Reming.. ...caught beatin' his wife nearly to death. Well, judge, I-I never did have a wife. I was just watchin' a card game in the Wet Your Neck saloon when Gorman pinched me. There ain't enough women in the Territory to go around now let alone you beatin' 'em up. Two years' hard labor. Next case. This here's Reggie Manors the dude that figured he could cold deck Lou Larkin in the Wet Your Neck saloon. Found four aces up his sleeve. Territory ain't wantin' tinhorns. Oh, I say, Mr. Sherlock Holmes isn't that puttin' it on a bit thick? By Jove, he must be up the pole. Quite barmy, you know? Huh! So help me, fish and chips. Two years of hard labor for the dude tinhorn. Next case. Smith J. Brown. Murder of Chip Carter. (Frayne) 'Yeah, I saw him do it myself, judge.' Smith J. Brown.. Ten years' hard labor. 'Is that all, sheriff?' That's all this mornin', Your Honor. No, it's not, we demand a fair trial by a fair jury and a judge that's not in cahoots with this outfit. Why, sheriff.. You dare speak disparaging of Judge Barko elected by the citizens of Red Town? [instrumental music] Add two years extra for each case for contempt of court. I should kill you. You're more valuable alive than dead right now. We'll sweat the starch out of you in the prison camp. Take him away. If I could only get my grandpappy's squirrel rifle. [instrumental music] [clears throat] Hurry up there. Say, you.. What's your real name? Smith J. Brown, why? Brown, huh? I've seen you before, somewhere. Ever been in Cut Bank, Texas? Maybe. I've traveled around a lot. Go on, get back to work. [music continues] I say, do you know that filthy bounder? Why, I put my brand on his cheek a few years ago caught him whippin' a horse. If he ever finds out who I am.. There's speckles on the sun today, Tal. Triple trouble comin'. I got an ache in my bones like swamp misery. Woe is on the way. Hey, you. Come on, get up! I don't tolerate weaklings here! - Get up, I said! - Wait a minute, Frayne. That man's all in. Oh, you're interfering, eh, Brown? Well, I'll take care of you. [dramatic music] Get back. [clamoring] Get right back. Get right back to work. I'll take care of you tonight, Brown. In camp. Now, get back to work. Grab those shovels and get back to work. [indistinct yelling] - How are you, Mr. Ordley? - How do you do? (Frayne) Thought you'd like to inspect the dam, huh? (John) Yes, we thought we'd look it over. 'Well, come on over this way.' Would you care to visit the dam, Ms. Ordley? No, I can see all I want to from here. Oh, alright. Right this way, Mr. Ordley. (John) 'Thank you.' If you're interested in that convict, forget it. - Are you comin' or not? - No. I'm gonna try and make a getaway. Now's your chance. While they're inspecting the dam. [indistinct yelling] Come on, Gil, let him have it. Teach the others a lesson. [gunshot] Hold on! (male #1) Ms. Ordley's horse got away, come on. [clamoring] [dramatic music] - Karan, are you alright? - 'Yes, father.' - You're not hurt, honey? - No, I'm alright. - Many thanks, Mr. Brown. - I'm grateful to you, son. Oh, that's alright. Get off that horse, wise guy. Forward, march! 'Come on.' Oh, my. What a beastly day. If we could get out of here if I could get me a squirrel rifle. Hey, you.. You're Tal Holladay, of the Twisted-T-Ranch. I'd know you in a million, Holladay. I used to work for you and your father. - 'Who are you?' - 'Slats Dawson.' (Tal) 'Listen, Slats, what's it all about?' - What happened to dad? - Plenty. Tell me about it. It was deliberate murder. I didn't see the shootin' but I found the body in the creek back of the Twisted-T bunkhouse. I saw a couple of fellas hightailin' it away after the shot. I ain't sayin' it was Butch or your Uncle Jim Cudlow that killed your father but they threatened him a couple of times. Why did they threaten him? I don't know unless it was on account of the river. It's common talk, the Ordley's are damming the river. You ought to know why. I'm beginning to see light, Slats. The river has a habit of changing its course. Why, they're stealin' my ranch from me and I'm helpin' them do it. They shot my dad to get him out of the way. Hey, Brown, come on out here. Frayne's waitin' for you. - Well, what do you want? - Plenty. You're gonna get back that punch in the jaw you gave me today. Gorman here gets first crack at ya, fella. He's kinda riled because that Ordley gal wants you to break a horse for her on the O.K. Ranch. He's gonna change your looks a little, handsome. Yeah. Come on. Let him have it, Gorman. [dramatic music] Come in, Gorman, give it to him! Come on, Gorman, let him have it! Come on and get up. You ain't givin' us no scrap at all. You dirty Texan. I'll kill you the day the dam's finished. Take him back to the Ordley Ranch in the morning, Butch. If he gets tough, bend your gun over his head. That won't be any trouble at all. Come on, you. Get in there! Go on! [instrumental music] Well, come on, Butch, do your stuff. Yeah, and you remember you're here to break a horse and not be funny. Just watch your step. I'll be keepin' an eye on you. Don't worry, if I had my way I wouldn't even be here. You don't have to stay, Mr. Brown. I thought I was doing you a favor for what you did for me. Where's the horse you want me to gentle? Over there in the corral. [instrumental music] Come on, Brown. You've got a horse to break. [dog barking in distance] - Well, he's hurt. - Yeah, my ribs are caved in. Thanks to you Ordley's and your friends Gorman and Frayne. - Get goin'! - Oh, leave him alone, Butch. Whoa, boy. Easy, easy. Easy! Easy! Whoa-ho! [instrumental music] Say, if I had his spirit, I.. Just what would you do, mister? I'd turn him loose in the hills. He doesn't belong in a two-by-four corral. I want Sky Rocket for my own private use. Now, can he be gentled or not? Well, his kind can be gentled, but it won't be with quirt and spurs, it may take a week my way 'and I'll need a catch rope and a gunny sack.' Hey, Brown, you're supposed to be breakin' a horse. I'll be responsible for Mr. Brown. You don't have to hound him. Gorman's orders, Ms. Ordley. This fellow's dangerous. I don't think so. Just let me have full charge of him for a while. Well, if that's the way you want it. - Thank you, Butch. - 'Thanks, ma'am.' (Butch) 'Come on, boys.' Nice fella. [instrumental music] Pretty music, isn't it? You're beautiful, Karan. Did anybody ever tell you that? Don't tell me you have a way with women like you have with horses? - What do you think? - Well, perhaps. - I don't know yet. - Maybe I better demonstrate. No, I think you're here about a horse instead of a girl. - Lovely tune. - I used to sing in Montana. - Then sing it for me. - For you? ♪ When moonlight ♪ ♪ Is riding the range ♪ ♪ I'm riding alone ♪ ♪ But I'm dreaming of you ♪ ♪ It seems that I hear you ♪ ♪ I feel that I'm near you ♪ ♪ When moonlight ♪ ♪ Is riding the range ♪ ♪ So ride with me ♪ ♪ Out on the range ♪ ♪ When deep purple shadows ♪ ♪ Are turning to blue ♪ ♪ Together we'll wander ♪ ♪ To somewhere out yonder ♪ ♪ When moonlight ♪ ♪ Is riding the range ♪ ♪ The prairie is lovely ♪ ♪ When day fades away ♪ ♪ When you learn to love me ♪ ♪ You'll know what I'll say ♪ ♪ I want you beside me ♪ ♪ With your love to guide me ♪ ♪ When moonlight ♪ ♪ Is a-riding ♪ ♪ The ♪ ♪ Range ♪♪ What are you doing here, Karan?

It won't do you any good. You have no right to interfere with my affairs. Now, get out, before you start something you can't finish. So long, Hub. I don't understand Hub. He is my foster brother, you know? No blood relation. So, don't pay any attention to him. [laughs] Don't worry. I won't...yet. That bronco-snapper galls me sore. He fits into my plans like a glove. Listen, Gorman and me are fixin' to take this whole ranch. You fellas are in with us too, see? But first we got to get old man Ordley out of the way. And it's going to look like Smith J. Brown done it. - How do you figure to do it? - Easy. It will take him at least a week gentling the mare, the way he's doing it now. That'll land him up Saturday. Ranch payday. You'll be takin' him back to the prison camp, Butch. Well, he'll get away from you, see? It'll be about time old man Ordley's comin' home from town with the payroll money. Well? Oh, Brown will hold him up. The old man will go for his gun.. ...Brown will have to kill him. [instrumental music] Come on, handsome. You ain't goin' to no dance tonight. We're due back at camp. Now, come on! We're late. Alright, handsome, now you can finish up makin' yourself beautiful. How'd you make it out, Tal? Did you learn anything? I told you that girl would help us out. - Has she? - Well, not exactly that. But...me gentlin' her horse got us this. Take it, Pewee, and hide it. 'You and Wells look like you ought' to be able to handle those. By the time I get finished gentlin' that horse I would have guns for all of us. You're takin' an awful chance smugglin' guns in here to us. - You could go it alone. - Ha-ha. Against that outfit? No, we all got to stick together. To the last drop of tea in the blooming cup, old boy. Hey, what's goin' on out here? Come on, hurry up and finish up and turn in. Get goin'! Come on. Hurry up! And you too, handsome. Come on. Careful, Mr. Brown. [upbeat music] Ride him, cowboy! Take the wild edges off him. [clattering] [music continues] Come on! I wish I could remember just who that hombre is. It won't make any difference after tomorrow. He's gonna kill old man Ordley. And the crowd'll string him up. Well, I've been workin' him for about a week don't you think you better come in and get acquainted with him? - Well, not yet. - Oh, don't be afraid. I'm makin' him a one-man horse, and when I get through with him he'll kick the daylights out of anybody that comes near him, except us. Oh, Karan, this has been a wonderful week. - Tomorrow and.. - Tomorrow and what? Well, if anything happens I just want you to know that.. Well, I'll try to see you sometimes and make you understand-- Why? What-what can happen? Anything. Everything. I've got to clear myself of this murder charge and get back what they took from me. Tomorrow may be our last day together. You said it, bronc buster. Come on. Get the saddle off that fuzztail and take it in the bunkhouse. It's time we was back at camp. Well, I'll see you tomorrow and we'll see how Sky Rocket acts. [instrumental music] - What you got there, fellow? - Some old clothes. Well, throw 'em away. You won't need 'em. - But-- - You heard me! Oh, let him have them, Butch. They'll at least make a pillow for him at camp. Alright. Come on, get goin'. [instrumental music] Halt! Tomorrow we'll be gettin' out of here. Now, you've all got guns, so keep them hidden. - Get everything ready. Shh! - You can depend on me. Alright, come on. Hurry up, come on! [dramatic music] (Butch) Tryin' to light out on me, huh? Well, Sky Rocket shied and I couldn't hold him. His saddle-- Yeah, you get any ideas of running out it'll be just too bad for you. Oh, put your gun away. He won't run out on you. Hey, what's the meaning of this? - Back up to that tree. - I'll get you for this. Put your hands behind you. Sorry, I have to be rough, Ms. Ordley, but you know what I told you and your father back there or your outfit woulda killed me if they'd known I was Tal Holladay. Now, it's my turn to do a little thing that you Ordley's have been doing. You, Tal Holladay? Yes, are you gonna sit down while I tie you up and be peaceable-- I'll do nothing of the kind. You put a hand on me and I'll.. You better kill me now, Holladay. Because the next time we meet, it'll be my turn. Yeah, I will when I find out what you were doing on the Twisted-T the night my father was murdered. Here are the keys to nurse's handcuffs. Now, if you squirm hard enough, you can be loose in a couple of hours, I'm gonna take Sky Rocket with me but I'll leave you a horse so that you won't have to walk back into town. You'll regret this, Tal Holladay. [instrumental music] You fellows follow him out of town. You know the rest. [dramatic music] [instrumental music] [gunshots] [gunfire] [dramatic music] What's the matter? What happened, Mr. Ordley? Looks like a robbery. They shot me. I'm mighty grateful to you, Brown. Well, you ought to be, because if I had known it was you in this trouble, I'd have kept my nose out of it. - Why, I-I-I don't get you, lad? - You don't. Well, you will when you get back to the ranch. Karan will tell you why. [instrumental music] [dramatic music] Alright, get those guns out. I got horses down the river. Now's our chance. [bell ringing] What's the matter? What happened? I don't know. Someone hit me on the head. Well, they must be makin' a break. - Search the yard. - Come on. Can't go that way. Put that table up there. Try to knock down this wall.

What did you find out about the dam? Well, I've been watchin' for two weeks, just like you said. They finished today and moved the prison camp but Frayne's still up there with a dozen men guardin' the dam. (Tal) Well, we'll take care of that dam tomorrow night. What we need now is some dynamite. I saw a box of it at the O.K. ranch, we'd better get it. Come on, Spooks. You better come along with me. Bring that good luck charm along with you. We'll probably need it if we run into trouble. - So long, boys. - So long. I think I'll go and saddle my horse. Right. Oh, I'm going to have a lovely evening. Looks clear, I think I can make that tool house and get the dynamite. I hear the squeak of a field mouse. Grandpappy always said it was a sign of trouble. Well, your grandpappy ain't here now. [instrumental music] Wait here. Stand where you are, Tal Holladay. - Well, why don't you shoot? - Don't you think I ought to? You tricked me, Holladay. You stole my horse and left me tied up out there. - And now.. - Now, you're gonna turn me in? Oh, what difference does it make? What difference does it make? Can't you see it's a matter of life and death? If Gorman gets his hands on me again, he'll kill me. - Can't you see that-- - I see, alright. You were heard to threaten my father and Hub. Now, why shouldn't I send you to prison? No reason in the world, Karan. I figured if I kept an eye on you, Karan I'd soon find this galoot. Drop that box and stick out your hands. Yeah, I'll drop it, but it's full of explosives. - Wait a minute. - Drop your gun. You too. I'm sorry to disappoint you, Ms. Ordley but I'm not going back to prison tonight. Now, you go on up to the house, incase Gorman changes his mind. You get goin' over that way, one false move, and well.. This box'll make a lotta noise but I'd just as soon go up with it 'as go back to your rotten prison camp.' Come on, Spook, we're gettin' outta here. - With the sheriff? - No, just as far as the horses. - Then we'll leave him. - Ooh, be careful with that box. That'll be far enough, Gorman. Well, what do you want me to do? Oh, just stand there and count 500 until you get ready to make a holler. Well, so long, we'll be seein' you again soon. [instrumental music] (Butch) What's the matter, what's up? You idiots must've been sleepin'. Tal Holladay was just here. Get your horses! - Who? Holladay? - Tal Holladay. - What was he doin' here? - I don't know. He was in the tool house carryin' out some dynamite. That means only one thing, he's gonna blow up the dam. - We gotta stop him. - Come on! [dramatic music] (Butch) That galoot's as slippery as an eel. Got clean away, again. Look, he's got dynamite, you go to the dam and tell Frayne to double the guard. Right. (Gorman) Come on, fellas. [harmonica music] [horse trotting] (Pewee) Why, it's Tal. - Hi, fellas. - Hello, Tal. Any luck, old bean? Listen, I've got to blast that dam and make a channel so deep 'that water'll never come into my land again.' Well, that's gonna be a tough job, men. I just got back from the dam, Frayne's tripled the guard so even a snake couldn't get through it. Who are you and where did you come from? [chuckles] Why, just call me Chris. You fellas left a trail up here a blind man could follow. Say, do you need an extra gun hand? - Who sent you? - Karan Ordley. - She wants to help you. - Karan? Why, her bunch got us into this mess. She said she owed it to you for what you did for her dad. I've heard your side of the story. I'd like to tag along with you. He looks alright. Looks like he might be a fast gun hand. And we need all the help we can get around here, Tal. Alright, Chris. Pick out a spot and go over and sit down. Now, remember, if there's any funny business well, there'll be trouble. Alright, big boy. [chuckles] You fellas don't have to worry about me. Say, it's about time you did something about the dam. I don't see how though, the guards are thicker than flies. Ah, don't worry, I'll get to it somehow. - Well, you'd better do it soon. - Why? I heard Hub Ordley's bringing John Logan the Secretary of the Interior in to establish the boundary between Texas and the Territory. Now that the dam is done and the river's flowin' across your land.. You know what Logan will do? Sure, he'll make the river the boundary and throw the strip in the favor of the Ordley's. Secretary's in Red Town today. There's gonna be a big celebration down at the dam. Hub Ordley's plan is ace in the hole. Well, then there's only one thing for me to do. I'm ridin' into town and see Logan and lay my cards on the table. - It's my only chance. - Don't go, Tal. Look, the varmint's eye is winkin'. The devil is laughin' and somebody gonna die. Ah, don't worry about me, Spooks. I'll be alright. You just stay here and keep your eye on the camp till I get back. It ain't right for you to be meetin' double trouble. I'm ridin' with you if I can get my hands on a squirrel rifle, look out! By Jove, I'm going too. Let's all go and give them a bashing about. - Yeah, let's all go. - Ah, thanks, boys. What are you gonna do? Think I'll go too. [instrumental music] Say, do you see what I see? - Tal Holladay. - Yeah. Well.. I wanna see Mr. Logan. You'll find Mr. Logan upstairs. Come home to roost, eh, Holladay? Now, you'll get a welcome. This town's waitin' to string you up on sight. - Drop that gun down and fast. - Hurry up. [indistinct chatter] The Texas killer, folks. Tal Holladay. Just in time to make the celebratin' interesting. Yeah, get me a rope and we'll string him up. [indistinct yelling] - What are they doing? - They're gonna hang Holladay. [instrumental music] Come on, let's give him a necktie party. He's the one that killed Chip Carter! [clamoring] I want to do this, boys. It ain't just accordin' to law. How'll it feel swinging up there, Holladay? You'll find out someday, Butch. What's goin' on here, Gorman, what you tryin' to do? Now, don't try to interfere, Ordley, the crowd's pretty ugly. And they might hurt you too. You keep out of this, dad. Holladay's got this comin' to him. No, he hasn't. Maybe some of the rest of you, but not him. (Gorman) 'Killed Chip Carter. He tried to kill you too.' - 'Now, didn't he?' - No. It was Tal Holladay that drove 'em off. He didn't shoot me and I don't think he shot Chip neither. Throw Ordley out, go on with the hangin'. [clamoring] [gunshot] Back up! (Reggie) That's right, gentlemen. Give over. Keep your arms suspended or as they say in America, "I'll plug you, sure enough." Now, if any of you take it into your head to follow us or even take a shot at us, don't forget that rifleman up there. He's got his eyes peeled. You mean you're gonna leave here without gettin' Gorman and the rest of this bunch? Eh, that'll come later. Come on, boys. [instrumental music] Ms. Ordley, I wanna thank you and your father for trying to stop that mob. Be careful! [instrumental music] [dramatic music] - Tal. - Well, Cudlow. You killed my father so you could steal this ranch. They made me do it. Hub Ordley and Gorman. They made me and Butch do it. They'd kill me. Butch, it was Butch. He did it! I'll give you a chance. Back up and draw. Listen, Tal. You can't shoot me down like this. It's not fair. [gunshot] [instrumental music] (Pewee) It's a mighty big crowd over there, Tal. Yes, now listen, Pewee. If I can't get anywhere with Logan your cue to set the dynamite off will be a shot from me. Come on, boys. [crowd applauding] Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the United States of America I congratulate you on this memorable occasion. [applause] And, now, my friends it gives me pleasure to establish for all time the boundary line between the Indian Territory and your proud neighbor, Texas. [applause] In the future, there will be no disputes between the two domains. Now, first, I want to thank that public-spirited citizen Mr. Hubbard Ordley. That's him! [crowd cheering] Hey, what are you doin' down there? Shut up or I'll blow you to kingdom come. [screaming] Hey! Run! He's blowing up the dam! [all screaming] [instrumental music] - What's the meaning of this? - It's Holladay. - He's gonna blow up the dam. - Why? What's his reason? No reason, except he wants that strip of land for himself. He's an outlaw. He killed Chip Carter and a lot of others and we gotta put a stop to this! (Tal) 'I'm afraid it's too late.' Wait a minute! Don't pull that gun. Make one move to shoot me and up goes your dam. Now, Mr. Secretary, maybe we can talk this thing over peacefully. Well, from all I can gather your name is Tal Holladay. That's right, sir. Tal Holladay of the Twisted-T-Ranch in Texas. I'm ready to hear what you have to say. But I'm warning you, I've heard some bad things about you. Well, Mr. Secretary, these men here are using you and the United States Government to rob me of my ranch and to rob Texas of this strip of land. I don't understand. How could they do that? By simply building this dam and changing the course of the river. Don't listen to him, Mr. Logan. He's wanted on both sides of the river for murder. Yeah, he killed his own father. Yeah, that's right. We've seen him kill Chip Carter after he'd already shot Custer Holladay so that he can inherit the ranch! I had him in prison camp, but he escaped, he and his pals. And then they all turned outlaws. It won't do you any good. Jim Cudlow's confessed to everything. Mr. Secretary, these men are trying to blame me for exactly the same things that they have done themselves. Your public-spirited citizen, Hubbard Ordley over there is responsible for the whole thing. 'First, he had my father killed while I was away in Montana.' 'Then he had this dam built with the help of innocent men' 'whom he framed so he wouldn't have to pay for their labor.' Alright, Mr. Madden. Just what did you learn? Who is he? I don't know. Mr. Madden's the new United States Marshal. I asked him to investigate this thing and help establish some real law here in the Indian Territory. Mr. Logan, I've been riding with Tal Holladay here for several days and I'm ready to swear in open court that everything he's told you is the truth. My first official act out here is to place you men under arrest. From now on, Hub, you don't bear the name of Ordley. Alright, men, drop those guns and make it fast. Just a minute, fella. Keep 'em on. You try droppin' yours, Mr. Marshal. Drop it! Get your hands up. All of you. Get those guns. Both of them. [instrumental music] I'd advise you and your men to surrender peacefully. Boys, we're safe just across that river. Let's go. (Tal) You'll be in Texas if that dam goes up. [gunshot] Wait a minute, that's his cue to blow up the dam! [dramatic music] Look out, boys! - 'Come on. This way.' - 'Here.' [explosion] [water gushing] [intense music] Well, I guess that just about settles everything. Mr. Secretary, that'll send the Red River back in its own channel where it belongs and leave my ranch on the side of Texas. I guess you can establish the boundary for all time. [chuckles] [instrumental music] You know, Karan, if you could cook I could use you on the Twisted-T. ♪ My prairie's lovely ♪ ♪ When day fades away ♪ ♪ When you'll learn to love me ♪ ♪ You'll know that I'll say ♪ ♪ I need you beside me ♪ ♪ With your love to guide me ♪ ♪ When moonlight ♪ ♪ Is riding ♪ ♪ The range ♪♪ [instrumental music]
