Dear God... ...don't let a miracle happen. Let me get well in a normal way. Amen. AGNUS DEI A Convent School Mom... It's best for you right now. We have said goodbye to mother now, I think. Your mother can't take care of you. First she has to find a place to live. She's decided you should stay here. And that's the end of that. It's best for you right now. Sister Augustina is helping you. She'll look after you. Can you say "Sister Augustina"? "Sister Augustina"... Sister Augustina. - I can barely hear you. - Sister Augustina. That's better. Much better. Sister has permission to speak to the newcomer. The faster they learn the rules the better. In there mass is said for boarders on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays. On other days, morning prayer, and Advent and the Holy Fast. Come along. The convent was built in the 19th century. The nuns live here. It's called the Enclosure. Nothing there concerns you. Come along. The boarders' quarters are on your right. There are up to 60 girls, divided into smaller groups and classes. The older girls help see to the young. And we consider it a virtue to report irregularities. Starting each semester we issue 5 pencils and 3 exercise books. The prioress is our supreme authority apart from the Pope - - the Holy Virgin and the holy Trinity of course. You may undress. And be quick. We wash once a week. Collars are passed out twice a week - - except during fast, when no meal is served. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Come along. This is known as a closed convent. We go for air in the cloister. Letter-writing is on Wednesdays. Get in line... Stand still, girls. Hello, Sister Augustina. This is Johanne. - I want complete silence! - Yes, Sister Augustina. I'm Sister Barbara. What was your name? - Johanne. - What? - Johanne. - Her name is Johanne. You must wash yourself all clean. You can go first because you're new. But it was my turn. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Our Holy Lord, Almighty Father and Eternal God. I thank Thee for Thy kindness in feeding me - - a sinner, your unworthy servant. And he who with Thee and Thy Holy Spirit lives and reigns - - God from eternity to eternity. Amen. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. You may eat. You know what? You moved your lips wrong. Come on. How long will you be here? - Why are you here? - Why? - For no reason. - We're all here for a reason. Margrethe, because she has no parents. Lonni, because her mother has too many children. And Nanna, because her parents are abroad, right? I'm here, because my mother can't control me. So why are you here? My parents are divorced. I'm here because mom and I think it's best for me. Best for you?! Hear that? Best for her... The prioress is coming! Good morning, Prioress. You may sit. We have a new girl. Johanne. Stand up. Last time we talked about the seven deadly sins. Can you name one of the seven deadly sins? Teasing... That's not a deadly sin. Yes, it's dead wrong to tease people. Sit down. As I mentioned last - - the difference between ordinary sins and deadly sins is - - you must confess a deadly sin. If you don't confess them you don't go to purgatory - - and will be eternally cut off from the mercy of God - - and go straight to hell. The seven deadly sins are... Say after me. - Pride. - Pride. - Covetousness. - Covetousness. - Lust. - Lust. - Envy. - Envy-ness. - Gluttony. - Gluttony. - Anger. - Anger. - And sloth. - Sloth. Sister Augustina wants to see you. Me? It's in there. She's waiting. Go on... Didn't I tell you not to go in there?! You're to stay out of the Enclosure. But Marianne... You suck up... Chicken. What are you doing?! Leave the newcomer alone. - It was because I told on her. - Go to bed everyone! Are you out of your freaking mind?! It's good to see you smile. Sister Barbara! What are you doing? - Sister Barbara? - Yes, Sister Augustina? Please take a tray up to Sister Ingrid. "Dear Parents..." P-A-R-E-N-T-S. Parents. Remember you must never begin a sentence with "I". It looks immodest and selfish. Therefore: "Here everything is fine." "Soon we will prepare for the big celebration." "First Communion of the young." I expect you can spell "communion". You may write the rest. Leave the letters on my desk, when you're done. I don't think I'll survive this... This I won't survive, I think... I think you better re-write this, Johanne. We mustn't make the parents worry. Where are we going? What about breakfast? It's fast, you idiot. We have mass. What's a fast? Where do we do it? What do you do? You look holy. I can do it. Why on earth didn't you tell us you didn't receive First Communion? She's old enough. And from a Catholic family. Yes... Say the Our Father... ...who art in heaven. - Who art in heaven. - Hallowed be Thy name... - Hallowed be Thy name. - Thy Kingdom come... Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. - And forgive us our debts... - Forgive us our debts. - As we forgive our debtors. - As our debtors... - As we...! - As we... As we forgive our debtors...! Use the head Our Lord gave you. The head Our Lord gave you. As we forgive our debtors. - As we forgive our debtors. - Lead us not into temptation. - Lead us into temptation... - Not into temptation! The nuns live in the Enclosure. Nothing there concerns you. They won't come and help you. It's best for you right now. We don't want you here. And we don't like you. I want out! I want out! I want to go home to my mom. - Calm down... - No. I want out! I don't want to be here anymore. Sister Barbara... Go on. Go to bed. I miss my mom. I want out. The Virgin Mary is our real mother and God is our real father. God spoke through his son, Jesus: "Let the little children come unto me." God knows everything, understands everything. - But I don't know God. - God knows everyone. - How can He? - God sees and hears everything. - How does He hear? - When you pray. How do you pray, so he can hear? Come... Pray with all your soul. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Why are you here? We've received a letter from your mother. She writes that she is fine... But she doesn't know when you can come home. So Johanne must come to terms with staying here and living by our rules. - The child is baptized a Catholic. - She hasn't received First Communion. My God and Creator... What'll I do with that child? I'm asking to join the religion. Get up, child. Did you go to church with your mother? - On Christmas Eve. - Otherwise not? Jesus says: "Let the little children come unto me, and forbid them not." Does that include me? Or am I too big? God bless you, my child. Dear God... Are You listening to me now? Sister Barbara says You're my father too. Well, my name is Johanne. I'm sorry I messed up the other day. I want to come to You... If you want me. I expect You've heard me now. God bless you, my child. Johanne... - You have to attend another class. - Why? You're taking Religion. You'll be receiving First Communion. I spotted it right away. She's one of the young. Undeveloped. Look at her. - A little twerp. - That's right. With that...? Thanks. - I'll trade you that. - With this one? Mom and dad gave me this one. - God bless you, children. - Good morning, Sister. Let's see. Can anyone name the Virtues? Yes? - Frugality. - Very good, Judith. You may sit. Any others? - Yes? - Piety. Johanne... Can you name a holy virtue? A holy virtue, Johanne? Divine goodness. There she is. How are you coming along? - She is diligent and able. - Yes. She's one of the good ones. Johanne? May you carry the tray up to Sister Ingrid? - Holy priss. - I'll pray for you. It's Johanne with your dinner. She'll be receiving First Communion. Sister Barbara, is Sister Ingrid sick? - Why do you think that? - She has wounds on her hands. Go to bed. Come... Sister Ingrid means a lot to us all. Sister Ingrid is very saintly. More than any of us. Why? Because she has holes in her hands? Because she loves Our Lord Jesus so much she shares in His sufferings. The world would be a better place if we all were as saintly. - But she's bleeding. - And you have a sleep. May I see your picture, Johanne? It's the holy Teresa. She's so beautiful. Let's pass it around for everyone to see. Take your seats. Listen closely. Many years ago there was a woman in Spain named Teresa. She felt the pain and suffering of Jesus Christ on the Cross so strongly - - that she one night began to bleed from her side. Exactly where the soldiers had stabbed Jesus on the Cross. And her forehead began to bleed where they'd put His crown of thorns. And from her hands and feet where they'd put the nails - - when He was crucified. And no doctor could stop the bleeding. And the holy Teresa knew - - God had spoken to her, that she had a purpose. She saved many souls and many convents were built in her honor. She performed miracles. Many of those who prayed to her were comforted and healed. - Come on, Nanna. - Stand here. Come... - Hurry up. - Margrethe, you're the boy. Why me? What about Johanne? Johanne is a holy priss. - It's so red. - Your turn, Nanna. I'd rather wear lipstick than be the boy. That's out of the question. Stand here. - Now I'll show you. - Gross. Gross... Gross... gross! Come on, Lonni. Someone's coming! You can put your letters away now, children. We're getting closer to the big day. First Communion. Can anyone tell me what that is? Yes, Nina. It's the first time we'll receive the holy bread, which is Jesus. Correct. Today we'll talk about the holy confession. You'll go to your first confession before receiving Our Lord Jesus. Can anyone tell me why? Yes, Johanne. For Jesus to feel welcome. It's actually true, Johanne. You can sit. Sins, dear children. What sins do you know? When you forget to pray at morning prayer - - or if you let your thoughts wander during mass. Do you know more? Pickyness. If you dislike the food and give it to the girl next to you. A naughty one. Yes, Emma. If you forget to wash your feet. Nanna. Nanna! It's your turn, Nanna. - Where are you going? - It's a secret. I can't tell you. Come on. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name - - Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... Go ahead, my child. Go ahead. I confess that I have sinned. And... I didn't want to be here. And... I don't like it when Sister Ingrid bleeds. - There's something else too. - Go ahead. - Is it a sin to know something? - Know what? Some of the other girls have a secret. You should confess your own sins. Do you pray morning and night? Almost always. Say 2 Our Fathers and 3 Hail Marys, for your forgetfulness and vanity. Goodbye, then. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. - She's had an unhappy love affair. - You think? She's had a man in her life. That's why she's not loony like the other nuns. Will she be a virgin again after her calling? Stupid. She'll marry Jesus soon. She'll get as whacky as the rest. Augustina has never been with a man. You can tell. Sister Augustina is a witch. - I saw some of her hair. - Whose? - Augustina's. - You did? When they turn their heard - - you can see the neck under the vail. It's grey and greasy. They cut their own hair once a month - - and wash under their arms with vinegar water. Now, girls. Have a look at this. You've cleansed yourselves at confession. So you're ready for your white dresses. Look... Sister Barbara? It'll be your turn next. What does that mean? What will happen to you? Oh, Johanne. It means that I'll pledge my eternal vows. - Eternal vows? - Questions, questions. Yes, I'm getting married to Jesus. Until now we've just been engaged. I'm going to be a nun. - Aren't you now? - I'm just a novice. Is it true you've never been ...in love? Jesus has... well, proposed to me. And I'll pledge my life to Him. Then you'll never get out? Will you be here forever? - Won't you ever be human again? - It's not that way at all, child. Once you have your calling you won't want to get out, as you say. Hail Mary, full of grace, The Lord is with thee... It's freezing. You'll catch cold. Pray for us sinners... Eternal are my baptismal vows and the Church I will honor on its foundation I will build and follow in its teachings Thanks given to our gracious God the Church of Truth has taught me: I never it abandon will Girls... psst! It's time. Congratulations. There you are. Congratulations. Marie and Johanne! - Congratulations, Marie. - There you are. Congratulations. There's our Johanne. Congratulations. I've heard many fine things about you. There you are. Congratulations. Thank you. Did you know that the holy Johanne died as a martyr? She gave her life for her faith. We expect a lot from you, Johanne. Thank you. The Lord is my shepherd. I give my soul to the Lord. Ursula and Benedicte! Can I see? It's so beautiful. - Congratulations, Benedicte. - There you go. Congratulations. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Bless us, Lord, for the gifts we are about to receive - - from Our Lord Jesus Christ... It's about time. I was fasting myself to death. We've prepared a little entertainment for Your Right Reverend Sir. You have a fever. Her fever is high. If she doesn't feel better tonight we'll have to give her penicillin. I'm not so sure. You may go now... doctor. We must never forget that God in His great wisdom - - situates us where it's best for us to be. We expect great things from you, Johanne. How's our little saint? Are you asleep? Mom? I miss you. I miss you too. See if you can cheer her up. Johanne? When you die... ...can I have your prayer book? Johanne? We're calling for the priest. ...the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou amongst women - - and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God - - pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of death. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God... I don't want to die! Johanne, my little angel. You look a lot better. - She's still very pale. - The fever's gone. Pulse is normal. - How can you be sure of that? - Everything's fine. It might come back. It was a miracle. Johanne! Come and stand behind Marianne. - There's the resurrected. - Get in. We can't get it off. Go on! Johanne has gotten breasts. She has breasts. It's about time. Are you feeling better now? We've missed you. - It would be a pity if you died. - What...? Now that a life in the convent awaits you. Dear God... I beg you. Please don't make me a little saint. I don't want to. And I don't think I want to be one of Your children. Not because I don't like You... I just don't think I'm suited for it. Besides, I'm too big, right? Please let me off. Lonni... - Johanne? Johanne! - Wake up. What is it? It's your turn. - To what? - To come with us. You stay here. Stay here. Hold the candle. - Anyone want a cigarette? - Yeah, me. What about her? - Who is she by the way? - Just someone I brought. - She's kinda pretty. - Don't touch her. She's holy. She's going to be a nun. - Really? - No. Don't think you'll get out of here. I don't want to be a nun. It's not for you to decide. Once you've gotten your calling, that's it. Just you wait. Johanne, will you bring Sister Ingrid her tray? I would rather not do it. Go on. It's good for you. - How would that be good for me? - You don't know what's good for you. We know what's best for you. Make sure Sister Ingrid gets her food. Sister Ingrid? Sister Ingrid? Sister Ingrid? Hello, Sister. Johanne... Johanne. Johanne... Johanne? - What's the matter, Johanne? - Sit down. Get your knitting out. "They must wear their new spring garments on the seventeenth - - and they broke out in..." - You'll be fine by yourselves, right? - Of course. - Quick! Get up, Margrethe. - I don't want to. Hurry up. We want to see who's holy and who's not. She has hair on it, alright. You next, Johanne. - I don't want to. - You have to. I bet you're bald. Johanne is a holy priss. What are you doing? Dear God... I beg You. Don't make me a holy. I want to get out of here. I want to be like the others. Just ordinary. No miracles and stuff like that. I beg You, dear God. Give me proof that You don't exist. I beseech You. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. We're not going to see much of each other in the future. I brought something for you. What's that? - Marianne, are you sick? - Not at all. You want me to get a sister? I feel sick from all that blood too. Shut up about it. - Can I come in? - Shut the door. I'm with child. I'll kill you if you tell. - Will you do something in return? - What...? I don't want to be like Sister Ingrid. I don't want a calling. Once you have it, that's it. Can you do anything not to get a calling? - What do I do? - Kneel down. - My hands too?! - Of course. Someone's coming. What are you going to do? - Do...? - With the baby? Get rid of it. Can you do that? You can do what you want. Say "Satan" three times and "cock" three times. - What's "cock"? - Just say it. Satan, Satan... Cock, no. Satan... cock... ... cock ... cock. - Amen. - Amen. You think it'll work? You can always hope. Satan, Satan, Satan. Cock, cock, cock. Amen. Marianne... - Why haven't you touched your food? - I can't eat it. What's that all about? I'll let it pass this time. You don't have a fever. Go to bed! - Good night. - Good night, Sister. Get some sleep, Marianne. - Can I lie in your bed? - Sure. - Why didn't you eat anything? - I'm nauseous. - What'll happen if they find out? - All hell will break loose. Can I see your stomach? - You can't feel it yet. - Is it contagious? You better go back. No, you silly fool. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. You may eat. Marianne! Eat something. What's the matter? Get up. Marianne... What's with you? - We'll have to get you examined. - I don't want to go to the doctor. What if they find out you were down there too? - It's not contagious! - Marianne probably told on you... Johanne, the prioress wants to see you now. Come in. We expected great things from you... ...and had hoped you would stay with us longer. But it can't be helped. They'll come for you tomorrow. She forced me to go. But I'm not infected. You are talking nonsense. Your mother called, she's picking you up tomorrow. My mother...? She called? - Here? - Yes, she did. I also think it's too soon for you to leave the convent. But the ways of the Lord are past understanding. I'm going home! Dear Lord, thank you for not giving me a call. Johanne! Johanne! Where are you? Johanne?! My dear child, you're coming home. I can't come home after all. Come... I can't. I have to stay here the rest of my life. I'll never be able to come home. Look... Don't you see I've gotten my calling? I can't get out now. I have to be a nun. Come here, Johanne. It's not a calling. It's just because you're growing up. You're a big girl now. I'll tell you everything about it. - Bye, Johanne. Write to us. - I'll pray for you. Take care. Write soon. - I'll pray for you. - Bye, Johanne.
