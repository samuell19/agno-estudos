I don't know what to tell you. - Listen honey something's wrong. Can you meet with me? Please say yes. - Here's your answer, it's three o'clock in the morning. - Come by the factory, I'll take you to lunch. - You ain't gotta do that. See you tomorrow. - Ray, thank you. - Goodnight PJ. - There you are. Hey. - Hi Priscilla June. - Hi sweetheart. Ooh you look like you had a hell of a night. - I'm okay. - Place hasn't changed much has it. - Well it looks a lot worse sober. - Shame on you. - Old Budgie around? - You crazy? That's why I told you one o'clock. He's on lunch. - See he couldn't fire me twice. Still haven't heard from Marty He's just gone. Something's wrong, I just know it. - He'll call. - I know him sweetheart. If he hasn't called by now. - I wouldn't worry honey. It's just been overnight. - I guess. Anyway, thanks for coming down here and all. It's good to see you. I'll be right back. Just let me get changed. - Sure, you look great. - So how's your daughter? - Fine, it was her birthday yesterday. - Did you buy her something? - I took her out to dinner. No place fancy. - You mean she was in town. You should've called me. You know I'm dying to meet her. - Well it was all of a sudden. She surprised me. Only in town for a day. - Well maybe next time - Sure maybe next time. - Come on let's go and get something to eat. - You should eat more Ray. You look pale. - I got a nervous stomach. - It's the booze. Don't fool yourself. - You never let up do you? It's the southern blood. What's the matter? - Nothing, just thinking. - What about? - Why do you stay with Marty? Why do you let him walk all over you? Every time I see you with him, you're fighting. Just dump him. You could do so much better. You're special. - Come on Ray I don't need this. - It's the truth. Marty doesn't deserve you. You need a husband. Go out and find someone who respect you, someone you can trust. - He loves me. - He doesn't love you, he needs you. - What's the difference? - There's a difference PJ. - Jesus Ray, you're being kinda pushy don't you think? - And you're selling yourself short. - I can take care of myself. Anyway Marty's not the problem. It's his brother in law. - Might as well be brothers. - Look how come you're so down on them all of a sudden? He won't lend you money anymore. I'm sorry. I guess I just wanna figure things myself this time. You can understand that can't you? - Sure. - You will try and find him won't you? - I'll do the best I can. - You're a sweetheart. Ooh I'm late. Listen call me. Maybe we can go and see a show or something. - Yeah that'd be nice. - Bye. - Get up. I said get up you little shit. Get up. You're one stupid son of a bitch Ray. In fact, I don't think I've met anybody quite as dumb as you. 20 years under. - Richie it was an accident. - Accident? Jesus. - You think this is funny. You think this is some kind of joke. You meet me Sunday morning with my money or you're gonna be a headline in the post. - Richie I don't have anything. - Well then you come up with something. Now please, don't try taking off because I can find you. Sunday morning you meet me at Georgie's at closing or you're gonna be - I can talk to someone.

I just had it all fixed. - Nothing's gonna happen to it. I'll pay you. My check comes any day. I'll pay you back tomorrow night. - Money's got nothing to do with it. I make my living with that car. That's how I get into the city. Look maybe there's something else that I can do. - I have to see my daughter. I have to talk to her. - Well you can't drive all the way to Washington and back in one day. Why don't you call her? - She doesn't live in Washington. - What do you mean? - We don't get along. We never have. I was never around when she was a kid. I was in the service. Her mother and I, she started seeing this guy. One of her teachers. We got in a fight one night. I'm in some trouble now and I've got to see her. - I swear I don't even recognize you. - Okay? - Hell yes, it's terrific. You should shave more often. - Yeah? - You look like Johnny Cash or something. - Is that good? - Johnny Cash are you kidding? Burns a little oil and you can't step on the gas too quickly or the motor cuts out. Other than that it runs pretty good. What's the matter? - I don't know I think I lost something. - What? - It was a present for Cly. Must be back at your place in my other coat. - I took everything out of your pockets and put it on the coffee table when you were in the shower. I'll take a look around when I get back. Well, I better get going. I gotta get my laundry done and get to the store. - I really appreciate this. - I hope you work everything out. Good luck. - I'll call you when I start back. - It's okay. Just be back tomorrow morning. I promised mama I'd drive her to church. Bye. - Mayor Koch could not be found for comment.

Look I made a terrible mistake. Nothing is gonna take this away from you, ever. - What are you saying? - I worked something out. I don't need the money. - You scare the hell out of me over $20,000 and the next day everything's fine. I'm supposed to forget all about it? I don't wanna be lied to anymore. - I'm not lying to you. - I've waited for you. I wrote to you and this is how you come to me? I don't want a part time father anymore.
