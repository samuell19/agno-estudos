Tartu, May 1918 The Republic of Estonia, occupied by German Keiserreich Are they really going to do it? - Sure. Exactly at 3 p.m. Cheers! - Cheers! So a sovereign state after all! - Yes! The best moment has arrived. And what do the locals think about it? - They will thank us. Come! Here will be the Baltische Herzogtum. Historically it is a German territory. I think it has been Russian. - No, no, it has been German! A new flag will be hanging here soon. Henn, come quickly! - Ants, look! Let's stop time! THE NAMES IN MARBLE December 1918 Defeat in World War I ends the German occupation in Estonia. Soviet Russia attacks Estonia to establish itself in Europe. Mobilization of the Estonian Defense Army fails. The only hope for the young country are the volunteers. People from our age-group don't have to join the army. - So what? Let those go who have to! - It's not our business! You are like my old man: We'll never ever beat Russia... It has been so and it'll remain so. - But that's the way it is! - No, it's not! Boys, K?sper came! The boys from Treffner College will all volunteer. In corpore! Damn it, I will join also, you can do whatever you want. Me too! - And me! Me too! - Who else? Konsap, are you coming? - Who, me? Yes. - Good, Konsap! Kohlapuu? - I can't shoot at a human being. Kohlapuu is a coward! - I'm not! I can't discharge a gun at a human being. What about discharging in your pants? Then you can say, that there is "shit in your pants"! Check your own pants! - Great! K??mer? Why not? Why don't I want to die for the rich? - For the Republic of Estonia! Which Estonia? Mine or yours? Everybody's. There is only one Estonia! I'm not going to argue with you. I raised the flag with you, but I want no part of your Estonia. Have you turned into a...? - I have. And if you would care for our people, you would too. Now what? - Think against whom you are going to fight! You, damned pinko! Damned red! K?sper. K?sper! - What? Call K??mer back in! - What the hell...? He didn't agree with you, but at least he didn't attack you. Invite K??mer back in! Then I will go too. Ahas, wait! - What? - Are you a Red commissary? I am a student of the Tartu School of Commerce! K??mer, wait! Let him defend his riche's government himself! Red Army will be here any moment and everything will go back to its track. But that means foreign rule. Better foreign rule than guys like K?sper. Oh, excuse me. - Not at all. I think I should go now. - Sure. Serves them right! The mobilization notice was torn down. Dear brother' how are you? You had to wait to receive this letter. Sorry' I'm not much at writing. So' I am leaving Tallinn. I got no work. I will stop by our parents' house and try to figure something out. But you' brother' stay put in Tartu until these iffy times are over. Remember what mom told - you're the hope of our family. If you study hard each day jellyrolls will come your way Remember' when we stopped the time just for fun? Now the time has come. One has to do what one has to do. There is a new life ahead of us. Volunteer Mugur! Volunteer Konsap! Volunteer Martinson! Volunteer Miljan! Volunteer T??ker! Volunteer Kohlapuu! Captain, Sir, the 2nd platoon is lined up! Good. Look! A schoolboy! Let's get him! Turn to the right! Where are you going? Stop! Come on! Get him! Our forces left the town to the Reds. We were defenseless. And then the schoolboys started to shoot at people. They were guarding the storages at night! They kept order in town! They were the Commerce School boys. And then they left towards Viljandi. Please, tell your admirer... - Uncle! ...not to walk around with the student-cap on. The Red Militia is after them. Please take your cap off! Your cap! Everybody freeze! One man to the left, one to the right! It's too crowded here. I'm the head of the Tartu Militia Brigade. The law in the city is in our hands. Until the coming of the Red Army. Well, you White Guard bastard! Come here! He is Estonian, just like you. All three of you, come along! There! It's that schoolboy! No! He was not among them. I vouch for him. You were not with K?sper, were you? Were you, Ahas? You bourgeois-leeches, and you schoolboy-snotnose, march! Please. - Damned bourgeois! To the car! The other exit, quick! To the car! What are you waiting for?! Get in! It's already the third town we are giving up without a fight. Not a shot was fired. What a shame! So much for the republic. Serves us right, too! What the hell are you saying! And you are an Estonian official! Half of the country is still ours. Why are you running then? Why don't you fight? Who's going to join me? - Wait a minute! We announced the mobilization, we turned to the allies... What good does it make, if even Estonians aren't joining in! And the men who came wouldn't move a muscle, saying they had no supplies. - But that's just an excuse! - Of course. But back home they went to hide behind their wives' aprons. Like now in Tartu. Last year in Finland we at least took sides: Either Whites or Reds. Damn it! How far is your father's house? - About five miles from here. Well, then it's all right. You've got young legs. Our house is on the way towards Viljandi. You keep on walking and finally you're there. - Uncle! Well, if it happens that you can't stop dreaming about each other, then the young knight will come riding to his princess. Or will you come with me to Viljandi? To fight? I should go home first... - All right, then. Hello, brother! - Ants! You came home? - Not quite! But you? Going to the war. - Me too! Let's drop in first! - Well... You'd better stay here. - I can't. A lot of boys went from our class... - Punks! No clue what so ever! I've been racking my brains, discussing, contemplating... ...and you! Just go. Better go home to mom and dad. They wouldn't survive this. Let's go in and be together at least for a moment. - I'm in a hurry. I have to be on time. Remember' how we stopped the time just for fun? Now the time has come. One has to do what one has to do. January 1919, Southern Front How many schoolboys have we got now? - The platoons are full. Only the 2nd is undermanned. - How many boys are there? - Eight. Yours? - 2nd platoon! Insects and bugs' cockroaches and flies' came from Russia and waved their behinds. Russkies, start digging your graves! Force majeur is approaching! I took from a Russkie the boots I wear' the Russkie ran back over Peipsi feet bare. Take your positions! We will continue on foot. Our task is to cover the left flank. If possible to cut off enemy retreat. The Reds? - No, the Blues! - Yes, right by the village. How many? - Boys, form a battle line! Boys, take cover! - What happened? - They shot Ahas! Are you hurt? - I guess not. Look! They are coming! Load your guns! Run! I'm spent. Let them kill me. Take your guns! They would have surrounded us. - Who would have surrounded you?! You were running from a retreating enemy! They didn't fire a shot. They weren't even coming towards you. Why did you run away? - Everybody was running! You were the first to run! - I was not! - Who was then? I don't know. - Who the hell knows then? I was not! - And why did you throw the gun away? Whatever happens, never throw away your gun! Throw away everything, even your pants, but keep the gun. K?sper, that's enough! - Running from the retreating enemy! I was not the first one! - Shut up! We're all alike here! - I'm not like you. - Who are you then? I'm the leader of the 2nd platoon, who was left alone in the battle. I was not the first one. I am a volunteer of the 2nd platoon, I don't want anyone to yell at me. Then don't run like a coward. - Me! A coward! You'll regret it! Boys, boys! - K?sper! K?sper, listen! I ran first. I don't know what got into me. - I ran after Ahas did! I will never run again. I would rather die. I'm sorry, guys. I just flipped out. Damn, it was the first race I've ever won in my life! Damn, I ran so fast that even the fat around my belly was shaking. Damn, they broke a good mug! Men, we have to catch up with our troops now. Let's go one by one so they don't notice. Let's tell them that we got lost in the woods. - Picking mushrooms. 1st platoon! Did you notice that no one noticed! 3rd platoon! Good evening! - Good evening, battalion leader, Sir. Not bad for the first time! Well done! Especially you, schoolboys! We thought that you should have been kept away from the front. But you should have been introduced to the Reds earlier. I'll write you an absence note for school! Men, our duty is to hold the Southern Front, helping that way to quickly liberate Tartu and all of Estonia. That's all! Organize the guard-posts and let the men rest. - Yes! May I speak, Sir? - What is it? 2nd platoon is volunteering to stand watch. Everything is quiet. Messenger of Death. Don't shoot, I've got him. 2nd platoon! Here. - Damn, he is one of ours! Leader of the platoon K?sper? - Stop haunting! I thought the enemy was mounted, it would make us run faster. Take your men back to the village. The enemy is moving. Yes, understood! Scared? Never mind, we all shit our pants at the beginning. Do you have a light? - I don't smoke. - I have! Take cover! 2nd platoon, fire! No retreat! That's an order! Don't be afraid of their Maksim. They are aiming too high. These are ours. Attack! To the manor! 2nd platoon, attack! Open up or I'll throw a grenade! - Don't throw! Konsap! What are you doing here? Hands up! Freeze! Boy, calm down, we're all Estonians like you. "All Estonians like you", get lost! If I should fall today' I'll be dead tomorrow. My friends carry me to the grave' in tears and sorrow. I think they ran all the way back to Russia. I've got a new girl-friend. A war-trophy! I'll look around a bit. There won't be one enemy standing! Victorious troops - please accept the thanks from the local folk. Long live our beautiful meadow' live and bloom' our homeland. Sisters-brothers' come to the fields, take the flags and let's sing! Cheers, guys! I filled the bottles! What are you staring at? All right, I'm scared! I'm scared... I'm so scared... Come quickly! Look, who is here! I'm also scared. Let's join the others. Oh! The young master himself! Nice to meet you! - Same here! A real gentleman! Did my friend want to ask me something? - No. Something about Marta? No? "No" is a "no". What? Is this manor from the 19th century? - Yes. A Tudor from 1881. A small copy of Windsor Palace. Built by Count Freidrich von Berg. As to Marta - she stayed at home. Care for a dance? - Me? I hear you're the life of the party and a fabulous dancer. Up to the main road. Turn right at the ruins. The house is not far. So, aunty, would you care for a dance? Konsap, if somebody asks for me, tell I'll be back in the morning. Hello! - Hello! I'm getting cold. Take off your coat. Oh, so heavy? - Yes, that's the way they are. Do you want to eat? - No, thanks. We just ate with the boys. We had a little party at the manor, celebrating our first victory. I know. But I didn't know you would be there. I'll be right back. The towel is next to the stove. My mom and dad. Where are they now? - They died in 1905. Come, have a cup of tea. I adore raspberry tea... I have been pampered too much. - You?! Uncle allows me to do everything I want... I have an elder brother. And he is... everything to me... ...he loves me so much... What are you laughing at? - Nothing. It is so quiet. As if there was no war. What is it? - It's time. I have to be back in the manor in the morning. Take this. Put it on. This is my dad's! To my brother' from brother Ants. Give me a cigarette! - What? Are you deaf! A cigarette! - I don't have any. Are you Latvian? - Yes. I'll go? - Fine. Hey, guys, give me a cigarette! Hello, comrade! Is this St. Petersburg? Are Germans close by? The Latvian Red Hunters arrived! Oh, the cannons are here! The Estonians will regeret tris day! Go, go, chick! Stop! "Bitte!" You are invited to the head-quarters! Come in, close the door. Put the gun over there! So, you think I don't remember you, schoolboy? Quick! Let's get out of here! Let's go! Quickly! He needs help! Guys, we have to get them, quickly! Let's go! Go after them! Let's move! - Right under the fire? - Our troops are there! Where is the 2nd platoon? - Don't know. They've all fled. Marta! K?sper, go to sleep. - Captain, sir... - Go, I'll stand watch. Reinok and Vassiljev sent a message that everything is quiet back there. K?sper, in the morning we'll examine the situation in the village. Are we going to win this war? - Yes. And some day we'll have to defend our country again... and again. - Yes. On the clouds are many gods. On the clouds without me. I'll go and replace Kohlapuu. K?sper and the Captain have been gone too long. Mugur! - You're a total idiot! What are you doing? - "Dum-dum" bullets. Look, cut the tops off so that the tin would show. When a Russkie gets hit by this one, he won't ask for more. Why wouldn't he? - Oh, go to hell! K?sper is coming! Everything is fine! The conscripts ran away and the battalion leader went after them, but the good news is that the main army is marching on Tartu! General offensive? Kuperjanov's men, Finns, armoured trains - everybody! What about us? - We'll go together with Reinok's and Vassiljev's platoons. When the Reds leave the manor to move towards Tartu, we'll stop them. And if they won't? - Our troops will come to relieve us. Get ready! Where did you leave our Captain? - Captain? Here, take your gun. Ahas, come here! Somebody saw Marta in the village. She's fine. Thank you! What happened? - Nothing. What the hell! - Attack the enemy! Look at our bloody pacifist! What happened? - Our Captain is dead. I don't know exactly what happened. Four of us were returning from the village, when a shot was fired. The captain fell. We took cover, started shooting, but there was nobody there. Compete silence. Who did it? - I don't know! There is a bunch of reds somewhere here. It could have been them. I'm afraid I'm leading you all to certain death. Reinok, let's go! Where are you running? - To see K?sper. - Off you go... Our troops should be here by now! Tartu should be freed by now... Vassiljev, how are your men doing? - The boys are tired, otherwise fine. We'll go back now. Ahas! I told Reinok and Vassiljev not to fire prematurely. If something should happen, I want you to take over the leadership. That's an order, Ahas! Don't sleep, soldier! - You are a born idiot! Throw me the knife! Stop it! You are getting on my nerves! - Excuse me! Are they coming or what? Once upon a time a man didn't eat for two weeks, hoping someone would invite him to a wedding-party. But nobody did. Then what? - That's all. What a dumb story! - Go and tell him! Ow! - What is it? - I cut my finger! - Down! How dumb! They are coming! Be quiet! They are marching in file. They think the coast is clear. Let them come closer. - Latvians! Soon we'll blow them all to smithereens! Shit, too soon. Fire! Well, full-fledged communists! Faster, T??ker, faster! - Shut up, pacifist! Done! My gun is jammed! - Take mine! Damn, what now? - Don't know! The chain is O.K. - Is it jammed? Damn, the Latvians must have turned green in their faces! Cover me as soon as you are ready! - Bloody Russian girl-friend! Wait for me! Down! Down! You son of a bitch! What are you doing there? Miljan! Take cover! Leave the bag. - Leave the bag, idiot! Take cover! What are you doing, you fool! - Miljan! Down! Cover me! Hang on friend, don't die on me! You are too young to die! Kohlapuu, where are you going? Don't go, you fool! Come back, damn Kohlapuu! Stop! - Come back, Kohlapuu! Attack! Are these the boys? - Yes. Battalion Leader wants to see you! Let's go! In the name of the Republic of Estonia I thank you for bravery. We do not have any medals to hand out... Thank you, boys! Captain will escort you home. You'll take the armored train. I hope the war is over for you... ...forever. Permission to address the captain? - Yes. Captain, Sir, I would like to serve in your team. Who will study then? They will study for me as well. They do it better anyway... Even a soldier needs an education. Captain, Sir, the Red Cross train-car has arrived. - Hook it up! Private Ahas, you have a visitor. Go. - Brother? Henn! You forgot it at my place! My dear! Sorry! Marta! Hello. - Hello. How are you? - Fine. And you are that railway station boy? - Yes. Great. Are you going to Tartu? - Yes. We'll meet there! Go on with it! Estonian heroes! Well, heroes - home we go! Our classmate. Marta, can you come for a moment? Well, my friend how are you? That's good. Look, what I've brought you! They asked to say that this goes for a medal! Our battles are over, now. Before the... Yes - before the end of the war! Before... the Sun goes to bed' I'll go to... war. Damn! This track was supposed to be repaired. Men, set up the guards! A piss-call. - Why are you dragging the gun along? A real man never leaves his "tool" behind. Henn, I'll be waiting for you in the hospital car! I wish I was home, fresh after the bath, between clean sheets. Mother will make pancakes in the morning... Don't do anything foolish, guys! Ants! - Brother! Ahas, you guard him! Let's go, guys! You could have told me! - Told what? Wait for me here! - Henn! Henn! Remember' when we stopped the time just for fun? Now the time has come. One has to do what one has to do. There is a new life ahead of us. Believe me' brother' we have everything ahead of us! The War of Independence ended in 1920. In 1940 the Republic of Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Russia. Estonia became an independent state. Not a single shot was fired.
