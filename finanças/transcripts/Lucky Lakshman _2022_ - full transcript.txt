Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir. Order, please. Sir, good morning. Order, please. I’ll call you back in a while. Okay, sir. Good afternoon, sir. Order, please. I’ll call you when I need you. Go away. Good evening, sir. Order, please. Didn’t I tell you that I would call you when I need you? Go away! What happened? The customer at the second table has been sitting there since this morning. When I asked him to order food, he’s getting irritated. And even if I wish to say something to him, I am reminded of our owner’s policy of “Customers are gods”. Alright, fine. Let it be. The owner will take care of this when he gets here. Yeah, that’s all we can do. Did you just wake up? -Good evening, sir. Alright, fine. Call me later. Good evening, sir. How’s the business doing today? -It’s not bad, sir. Since the weekend is tomorrow and the day-after, I am certain it would do even better. The customer at the second table has been sitting there since this morning, sir. He hasn’t placed a single order. And when I asked him to order something, he got all angry. Please talk to him, sir. Fine, you do that. -Sir. Get me two cups of coffee. Okay, sir. - Come fast. Have some coffee, young man. I don’t want it, sir. Don’t worry about it. Have it. It’s free. I am the owner of this coffee shop. Even so, I don’t want it, sir. You don’t want it? If that’s the case, why have you been sitting here since this morning. Well, why don’t you tell me what you want? I will ask them to bring it for you. I don’t want anything, sir. If you really don’t want anything, why are you still sitting here? Just tell me what you want. I will make them get it for you. You can take it with you and leave. You’ll give me whatever I ask for? Yeah, I will. What is it that you want? If so, I want this coffee shop. Will you sell it to me? What? You want me to sell you this coffee shop? Alright, fine. I’ll sell it to you. If you want to purchase this coffee shop, I am sure there is a very big story behind it. I am sure that that story gave you a reason. The thought of buying this coffee shop must have stemmed from that reason. I don’t have the energy or the patience to listen to your entire story. Just tell me the reason. If I like the reason, I will think about it. Thank you, sir. I spent the maximum amount of time with my favorite person in here. From today onwards, she’s not going to be a part of my life any longer. Ever since I’ve been sitting here since this morning, this entire time, I felt like she’s been sitting right in front of me. I felt like this is the right place for me to replace her memories. That is why I told you that I am interested in purchasing this coffee shop, sir. When I expected you to tell me a reason, I imagined that you would give me a very strong reason. But I never imagined that you would give me such a pathetic reason. You’ve already wasted a lot of time. Please leave. Sir, please listen to me. -That’s enough.Leave. Please listen to my entire story, sir. I’ve heard enough. -Sir, this is my life. I am not interested. -Just listen to my story for an hour, sir. If you don’t like my story, I would never look at this coffee shop ever again. Didn’t I already tell you no?What was it that you said? What? Listen to my story, sir. Not that.After that. If you don’t like my story… After that…at the end. If you don’t like my story, I will never look at this coffee shop ever again. Yes, what should I do to get you to take that step? Please listen to my story for an hour, sir. Will you leave if I don’t like your story? If you don’t like the story, you can do as you please. Alright. Even though I have absolutely no interest in your story, I am going to listen to your story because you say that you would never set foot here ever again. Tell me. Sir, this story dates back to the time when we were in our 10th grade. It’s 12 o’clock? Yes, he is sleeping. Why did the volume increase?! Come on, switch off! What happened here?! Come on, switch off! Father, well… I am unable to sleep. That’s why I am watching cartoons on TV. Really? If you had told me, we would have watched it together. I am coming there. Alright, come to bed. Oh! Looks like you were very curious right from when you were young. That’s not me, sir. That’s my friend Kiran. I already assume that getting to know you is a waste of my time. Why would you tell me about him? Well, sir…. since I have one hour of your time… I just wanted to get in to a lot more details in the story. Alright, go on. Excuse me. One second. Isn’t your name Sita…Geeta or something on those lines? Yes, it’s Geeta. Geeta, right? One second. Take this. What is this? A letter of absence? Foolish girl! If it’s a letter of absence, I would hand it over to the teacher. Why would I give it to you? Well, what is it then? -It’s a love letter. How dare you stop me on the road and hand me a love letter? Do you know what will happen to you once my mother gets to know that you gave me a love letter? This letter is for your mother. Give it to her and tell me what her answer is. I will be waiting for her reply. You are not the kind to just look and enjoy. You prefer acting upon it, is it? That wasn’t me, sir. I was talking about my friend Charan. Could you give me an approximate estimate of how many other characters you would be introducing? Roll no. 3? -Present, ma’am. Roll no. 4? Present, ma’am. Roll no. 5? Present, ma’am. Roll no. 6? Roll no. 6? Present, ma’am. Sir…. that’s me. My name is… Kiran, you failed in the exam, didn’t you? Sir, I didn’t do well because a day before the exam, I was down with fever. You were down with fever just a day before the exam? Yes, sir. Should I tell you how fever feels like after you get your results? Sir, no… Sir, please don’t. Don’t hit me, sir. Sir, please …no… Rascal! -Sir! Girl, why did you fail in the exam? I did not take the exam, sir. Really? Why? I got my period, sir. -Oh? Charan, why did you fail? I didn’t attend the exam, sir. Why didn’t you attend the exam? I got my period as well, sir. You got your period? Rascal! -Sir, no! It would have been better if you copied in the exam. You would have passed the exam. Look at how you’ve grown your hair. Like a Jumanji! Period, huh?! He is always partial towards girls. Laxman. -Sir, good morning. You are school topper. How is it that you failed? Sir…well... What is it? Guys, move. Everybody move. Is it possible he fainted because he is pregnant? Yes, it’s possible. Hey, go outside. Hey, go outside.Get out. Charan believes everything he is told. Mindless fellow! Menstration, huh? Stop that, Charan. Were you trying to sprinkle water on my face or wash it? What an escape. Well, you are the smartest and the most intelligent in our batch. Did you think I was on menstration like this guy here? What does ‘menstration’ mean? Well, matured means not flaunting your maturity around. I don’t think that’s it. You keep making up something or the other. Let’s see if you can summon up the courage to talk to the girl in the first place. When my family moved here first, there was an older brother who was our neighbor. He had a girlfriend when he was in the tenth grade. But later, he got into some mess because of the girl and so, had to leave town. That brother always had the best things to say about his girl. But before he left town, he told me something. He told me that even those who lose their wealth would be able to bounce back. But those who place their trust in a girl will never rise to height. Those words made a very deep impression on me, Charan. Ever since then, I have been keeping my distance from girls. I mean…. I just enjoy them from afar. They’ve got nothing to lose and neither do I. What happened, Lucky? You seem bothered. Nothing at all. -Tell us. Forget about all that. Are you coming to the picnic tomorrow? I am not going to make it. Are you kidding? Is this why you were acting like something was bothering you? You guys go on ahead. I am not interested. Nothing doing. Are you going to be coming or not? Guys, please try and understand. If you don’t come, we will not go either. Buddy, what happened was… Before I came to school today… Father? Everyone in the school is going to the picnic. How much? -Hundred bucks. Come here. Don’t be shy. Come. Lift your pant up. If I really had those hundred bucks, I would have bought you better socks. Why would I send you to school in a sock that you need to hold in place with a rubber band? Oh, my dad! Mother… What is it? Everyone in the school is going to picnic. Tell them that you have a stomach bug. Mother. I used that excuse when we had to go to the museum. Well, tell them that you were throwing up. I used that excuse when we had to go to the exhibition. If so, try something new this time. Mother, it would sound horrible if I keep giving excuses every time. Just this once, let me go, mother. Please. How much? -Hundred bucks. Come here once. Give it to me, mother. Give it. Everyday when you come back from school, you would complain that the food is unseasoned. Did you think that I couldn’t cook? I am mindful of the expense of even our spices. How would I have a hundred bucks on me? Alright, fine, mother. I didn’t want to discuss that horrid tale. That is why I said that I wouldn’t come to the picnic. One minute. -Kiran. Here. Shall we go to the picnic now? You guys are true friends. What’s the meaning of this? -Shush. The other day, didn’t you look at me in the classroom? -Me? I didn’t look at you. -I saw you looking at me. My gaze must have wandered off casually towards you. Have you been looking at me casually for the past two years? Why are you being like this with me? I love you. If anyone see us, it’s going to scandalous. Are you scared? I will get rid of your fears. Hey, please. Don’t do that. Let me go. I don’t want to do such things. Hey, what are you guys doing there? What is it? I was heading to the library to study. But he pulled me aside and is confessing his feelings towards me, sir. How she turned the tables?! What’s going on with your son, sir? He was a school topper. And recently, he failed in a subject. Now he is misbehaving with girls. Sorry. I didn’t expect this. Sorry, sir. This sort of thing will never happen again, sir. I am letting you off because you have a good academic record. Sir, I… Stop it. The principal is speaking. Please continue, sir. I am letting you go because of your father. If you repeat this, you will be out of the school. Remember that. What the hell is this? Father, I didn’t do anything. She called me aside… That’s wrong. You shouldn’t speak about girls that way. Father, she was the one who pulled me aside. The is a women in our house as well. You mustn’t speak that way. What is it that you are saying? I shouldn’t tell you what I want to say? Tell me. I was headed to the library to study. That girl pulled me behind the building and said, “I love you”… You are doing it again. I told you that you mustn’t speak about girls that way.Why don’t you listen? Alright, father. I am in the wrong. I will never repeat this mistake ever. Let’s just go home. Alright, fine. This is how our lives are going to be. Charan, don’t you think it would be better to stop watching TV in the middle of the night and instead, get some CDs. Perhaps a pen drive would be better. What do you say, Lucky? What is it with my father?It doesn’t matter what I ask him,he simply says that he has no money. But if I insist on the money, he tells me that he spends all his money for my education. And I understand that it’s for my future and so work hard at my studies. But, shouldn’t he trust his son a little at the least? Why would he believe everything everyone says? Forget about all that. In a couple of weeks, we will be sitting for our board examinations. Just focus on your studies. Why does he seem so off? What happened, buddy? Nothing at all. Just the usual at home. Leave that. Where will you enroll for your intermediate studies? I am going to the next town. And he is headed to a hostel in Tirupati. My father’s business is not doing too well. He said that we should head to Hyderabad. I heard he even sold his shop. He told me that he’s going to look for a job and get me educated there. That might be the case but leaving behind the place of your birth is always a difficult thing. This is just my place of birth. But we don’t even own a house here. Don’t dwell on it, buddy. If you do well in life, you can buy as many houses as you want here. Let’s move on from there. At present, we need to make a promise to each other. What is it? We must meet during our summer holidays. Okay? -Okay. No, not like that. You need to promise me. It’s been two years since we made that promise. During this time, I didn’t meet the either of them. That’s cause succeeding at life is a more important and urgent ambition than meeting the both of my friends. And my father… He said that I would be in a better place in life once I finish my tenth grade. And later he said that I would be in a better place in life once I finish my intermediate studies. And now he says that I would be in a better place once I am done with my engineering degree. I don’t know if he is telling me the truth or it’s just a bunch of lies. But I don’t have any other option than studying. Come, Lucky. Sit down. Since today is your first day of college, I made you something special for breakfast. Idly. You consider Idly to be special? Alright. Is there some chutney to go along with it? Here, I made you peanut chutney. That’s not special either. I heard that freshers are bullied in engineering colleges. Please be careful. He knows all that. Pack his lunch or else he’s going to miss his bus. He thinks I must be punctual because I go to college riding in a college bus. I’ll be taking an RTC bus. There’s a bus to catch every five minutes. Don’t talk back. Take your time to pack me lunch. I wonder how my life turned out this way. Mother, make it fast. I’m coming. Here. -Give it here. Son, please wash your hands. I will wash them in the college. Don’t nag me. -Lucky. All the best. -Alright, fine. This is my engineering college. They say that four years here are going to decide the next 40 years of my life. I must stay away from girls. I am used to staying away from my father at home and staying away from girls in the college. But earlier, when I was headed to the college, my mother talked about seniors bullying the freshers…. …I was flippant about it. But after I came to the college, I am beginning to feel a tad bit nervous. Do it. That’s enough for today. Go on then. Go. -Thank you, brother. Hey, you! Come here. Me? Not you, I am calling the short fellow speaking over the phone. I just came to the college. -Brother. They are calling you. Come. Keep walking. Come on, come on. Let me take a look at your phone once. Brother. Give me your phone. My father bought it for me. Take a look at it, buddy. I didn’t call you. Why did you come here? Brother, I was the one who brought him here. Since you came without being called, stand aside. There’s nothing on this phone. He didn’t get a call. What the hell is this? Brother… brother… Brother? -Who is your brother here? Sir…sir… Sir… You are overdoing it. Let me take a look at your bag once. Brother…please….no… Give me that bag. What is wrong with this water? That’s water from the bore, brother. Go and get me a packet of water. Brother, go and get me a packet of water immediately. Would a packet be enough or should I get a bottle of water? Get me a packet of water. Alright, brother. You came even before I called you over. So, I’ll give you something simple to… Brother, the packet of water you asked for. Open the water packet. Open it. I might soil it with my saliva. -Just open it. Sorry….sorry….I apologize, brother. Pour it down. Not here, you fool! Down there. Do you know how to swim? Yes, brother. Back in my village, I swam a lot. Ever since I was young, I wanted to learn how to swim. I’ll give you a suggestion. There is a swimming pool close to my house. They charge only 50 bucks for an hour. Do you want me to speak to them? Let’s learn in that pool later. But first, teach me how to swim here. How would this amount of water be enough? If needed, get some more water. I want to be taught here. Alright, alright. Send him here.I will take care of it. Go, child. -Come here. And you…. come here! I wanted to give you a very simple task. Do you see that red color car over there? Yes, brother. It’s a Benz. There’s a girl in there. Go and propose to her. Brother, apart from them, you can give me any other task to do. Just do it. Ever since I was a child, I couldn’t really get along with girls. Go on. Go. Buddy, hold on. Brother…brother, please. Go and propose to that girl and come back here. Go. Go on, young brother. Go ahead. Why won’t you give me such kind of tasks, brother? You are quite a clever one. Excuse me? Tell her. Miss, I love you. Okay, thank you. I told her, brother. If you did propose to her, why would she walk away? Say it again, loudly. It’s the head of our department. Scurry! Excuse me. I love you. That’s fine. You already told me that, didn’t you? Miss, earlier, they didn’t hear what I said. That is why I said it out loud this time. Where are they? There’s no one there. I swear, Miss. Earlier, I was being bullied. They asked me to propose to you. That is why I said it. I am telling you the truth. Fine. What is your issue now? If you go and file a complaint against me, the first day in college for me will turn out to be the last day, madam. Please excuse me. Why isn’t this guy leaving yet? However possible, I must escape from here. Close your eyes and say sorry for ten time. I will forgive you. Okay, madam. Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Madam? Where did she go? Excuse me? Hello, excuse me? Please listen to me. What the hell is your problem? I said it because a senior ordered me to. There he start again. You mean to say that if I don’t scold you or slap you, you won’t believe that you are forgiven? No, miss. You are the second girl that I spoke to in all my life. I had a bad experience with the first girl. Ever since then, I’ve been staying away from girls. I don’t even bother with girls. When I proposed to you, you didn’t react how most girls would. You said, “Fine, thank you.” I am just worried that you might go and file a complaint against me with the principal. You don’t have to feel so bad. I receive proposals on a regular basis. -Hello, I love you. …just like this. Okay, thank you. You can leave. That is why I react that way. That is why I reacted the same way when you proposed to me. That is all there is to it. Okay, miss. Thank you. interesting character. So, let’s be friends. Shreya. Sure, miss. Won’t you tell me your name now? Laxman. Nice meeting you. That event led to our friendship. And within a span of a few days, we became even closer friends. Shreya, didn’t you go to the class yet? I am not in a great mood. You go on ahead. I am getting late. I shall be leaving. Won’t you at least ask me what’s going on with me? Oh yes. Why are you not in a great mood? When I was heading here, … What the hell?! Sai! You? Yes, it’s me. How much longer are you going to keep this up? Until you agree to it. If I really feel something for you, I will surely let you know myself. Please. I am getting late to the college. I am not moving from here until you agree. You… You’re upset over just one such incident? Not just one incident. I am being proposed to by at least 3 people on a daily basis. Shreya, I love you. Okay, thank you. Did you see that? I have an idea. Come close, I’ll tell you. All these boys have been proposing to you because they all think you are single. What if you tell them that you are committed? Yes. Watch me. Excuse me, I am already committed. Sorry. Shit, my bad luck. Okay? Come, Laxman. Sit. Comfortable? - I’m okay. Hey, there have leaves here on this. Oh, it’s just plastic. -Forget about it. The cold coffee here is really good. Especially hazelnut cappuccino. Is that an ice cream? Why would there be flavors in it? I am sure we can find some coffee from brands such as Bru or Nescafé. Well… Get out of that Yousufguda mindset and get into a better neighborhood mindset like Jubilee Hills. Take a look and see what you would like to order. All the items listed here are so expensive. I don’t know anything about it. You take a look. Alright. Excuse me? -Yes, madam. Two hazelnut cappuccinos. Okay, madam. Why do you like studying so much? Ever since I was a kid, whenever I asked my dad for anything, he would always say no or that we can’t afford it. He would say the same thing to my mother as well. My father wouldn’t fulfill even the smallest of my wishes. That is why I don’t like my father. In the future, when I get married and have children, I have to make sure I study well, succeed so that my children wouldn’t hate me. I have to take good care of them. That is why I am working hard at my academics to take better care of my children. That’s quite a heavy story. Alright, have some coffee. Hey, Shreya. Are you on a fast? Is that why you didn’t come for lunch. No, I am not in a great mood today. Same expression… Are you in the same situation as before? I already gave you the solution before, didn’t I? You already told me to tell people that I have a boyfriend. But a few of those people don’t believe me. If they don’t believe your words, you should show them. You are right. But who do I flaunt around as my boyfriend. Just get some no-consequence fellow as your boyfriend. That would get the job done. Which no-consequence fellow can I present so suddenly? No… -Please… No… -Please, Laxman. No… -Please… You mean to say I ama no-consequence fellow. Nothing like that. -Definitely not! Rakesh. -Why is she here? I already told you many times not to chase me around because I already have a boyfriend. But you never believed me. That is why I brought him here today, in person. Here, take a look. He is my boyfriend. Laxman. Don’t chase me ever again. Okay? I don’t believe you. I am telling you the truth. If he is really your boyfriend, you wouldn’t be that far apart. If I don’t make him believe, I will never ever be able to get rid of him in the future. Do you believe it now? There’s still something wrong. If he still doesn’t believe me… this is going to be the last resort. Oh goodness! -Do you believe it now? I am half convinced but not entirely. But I cannot get more physical than this on the road. Please try and understand. Don’t ever chase me again. Okay. Gosh…couldn’t get her either! Laxman, come on. Let’s go. Maintaining the circuit and protecting the resistor… How do you understand these things at all? Why are you making me sit here and trying to get me to study? Shreya, I love you. Your looks, lips, my hips… Your height matches with mine. I mean my heart. Okay, thank you… -Stop that. You kept saying thank you and encouraged this behavior. I will give you a more permanent solution. What is it? You trust me, don’t you? -Yes, I do. Okay. Raju, come here. Sit here. I am coming. Sit down. Well… -Tell me. Do you know this? The both of us are in a relationship. I don’t believe you. Someone who is a bookworm such as you is incapable of impressing girls. I don’t believe it. The situation called for it. Even then, I don’t believe this. -Really? Alright. Now do you believe us? Oh my rose! I will believe you. When you are so brazen with your kisses on her, why wouldn’t I believe you? I believe you. Look at her behaving like the innocent one here. She is a dangerous one. Alright, fine. Carry on. Well, are you free now? Why? Are you going to kiss me? I mean… could you please tell everyone in the college that we are in a relationship. You want me to spread this around the entire college? -Tell them. Of course, I will tell them all. Why wouldn’t I? Get lost! Take it! All my money’s gone down the drain. Don’t be a public nuisance by kissing so brazenly in the public. Whatever it is, go and do it in the car. It’s embarrassing to watch you guys. It was in the same situation back then. And I experienced the same reaction. Do you remember that day? -Yes. Get up. Get up. From today onwards, no one in the entire college is going to bother you ever. Don’t worry. Okay? Are you happy now? Let’s go. Hi, Shreya. -Hi. I have a flat tire. Could you please drop me at Banjara Hills that’s beside Jubilee Hills? I am not going home right now. I am heading to my cousin’s place. BHEL. If you could drop me somewhere along the way, I will try and manage somehow. Please, Shreya. -He isn’t letting this go. Laxman. Come here. We planned a date this evening, didn’t we? He’s always on time like a loan shark. Please continue this pretense. Okay? -Let’s go. Alright, fine. What a great actress! Come, come. Let’s go. Go on. Nobody reciprocates the feelings of someone like me who is sincere with love. It’s getting late. Won’t you go home? My parents are affectionate towards me. They don’t impose any sort of restrictions on me. What about you? Quite the opposite. only restrictions no affection. I am living with my parents because I don’t have a choice now. Your parents don’t take good care of you? They are the perfect example for how not to treat your children. Forget about it. Who are you guys? Get down. You stay in here. I’ll go and talk to him. Come, come. Come on out. Sir, just a minute. Come on. Won’t she come out? How much are you paying her? Sir, please don’t talk that way. Are you going to teach me how to talk? The both of you are here in this area, at a time such as this… And you are in the car with a girl. Don’t you think we understand what’s going on? Sir, we are students. Everyone who gets caught says the same thing. Sir, it’s the truth. Just one minute. I’ll be right back. What happened? Give me the ID card. -Why? Just give it. -Alright, here. Sir, take a look at this. We are students. Students? That means I have to call your parents. Come with me to the police station. Sir, please. Please try and understand. Sir, please don’t call our parents. -Young man. If there’s something you want to say, you can say it in the police station. Get in the car and follow us. Laxman! Well, sir. Come! Just come! Looks like she is calling you. Go and come back. Just one minute, sir. What is he saying? He says that he’s going to call our parents. If my parents find out about this, it’s going to lead to problems. Just one minute. Don’t be tensed. I will take care of it. -I am scared. I said I’ll take care of it. Don’t be scared. Sir. Take this, sir. Such a lot of money? -Alright, fine. SI sir will be making the rounds here soon. Just get back safely. -Thank you, sir. Why do you have such a lot of money? My father gave me that money to pay my college fees. I couldn’t do it this morning at college. I had that money so, I gave it to him. Why did you give him such a lot of money? If I didn’t give him that much money, he doesn’t seem the sort to let this go easily. What about your college fees? I don’t know. In that situation, I thought saving the girl I am with takes priority over anything else. That is why I didn’t give it a second thought and simply gave the money away. Forget about all this. I hope you are alright. Let’s go. Hi, Laxman. -Hi. Here. Go and pay your college fees. Never mind that. I’ll do something and try to explain it to my father. Why should you try hard when you are the one who saved me? Go and pay the college fees. Go. Take it and go. Go. Alright, fine. Okay, fine then. Did it you pay it? -I did. Okay, get in the car. -Where are we headed? I’ll tell you. Just get in. Do we have to make someone believe that we are a couple? No, it’s a surprise. Just get into the car without fussing. Laxman, don’t. Control yourself. Control. I can’t control myself. Who the hell…. Sorry. -Stop it. Did I say anything when you hugged me in front of all those people so many times? You even kissed me. I didn’t say a word. In fact, I even cooperated with you. And I hugged you just once when there was no one around and… I hugged you from behind. How could you slap me for that? This is how women are. Actually, I brought you here to say something. Even before I could say it, you spoiled the entire experience. Tell me… What is it that you wanted to say? Tell me. I will listen to you. Actually, the reason why I joined this college was to get away from my rich friends And make friends with like-minded people. That is what I told my dad to convince him to let me join this college. Hold on…hold on. Is there any connection between you joining our college, bringing me here and slapping me? Just be patient and listen to me. The day I joined college, I met you on the very first day. I began to believe that I would find very good friends here. Unexpectedly, the idea you gave me worked and I distanced myself from all those guys who were pursuing me. My respect for you grew. That day when we got into trouble with the police, you didn’t even think about how your decision would impact your education. Instead, you wanted to save me. That is when I realized that I see you as someone more than a friend. The reason I got you here today is to propose to you. But even before that, you ruined it. I love you, Laxman. Is this really true or is this some kind of pretense? Of course, it’s true. This love seems a new. This is a strange feeling that I have never encountered before. Even so, it’s quite beautiful. This is a never-ending feeling. I want to stay with you. You are my world. I have forgotten myself. This love seems a new. This is a strange feeling that I have never encountered before. I am bewildered and I watch, This spell will never be broken My loneliness is growing distant from me when your hugs come close. Let’s become one and stay together. Let’s just stay with each other and keep the entire world out. This love seems a new. This is a strange feeling that I have never encountered before. Just like the flying birds and just like the wind, Just like the flowing river, like the aged crescent moon Like the moon light, like the shining star, like the never-ending sky. Let’s just stay like this. This love seems a new. This is a strange feeling that I have never encountered before. Buddy, look over there. He is such a lucky guy. How could a girl such as her fall for a guy like him? And she bought him a bike? Everyone in the college is so jealous of him. Girls who are rich love dogs more than men. Did you look at that? Why is she coming here? If you are really capable, try and win a woman’s affections. Stupid. You are all talk, buddy. And you put on such airs! Forget about this. Tonight, I am going to put him in his place. Why did you hit him? He is a senior. So what if he is a senior? He was belittling you. And I can’t take that. After giving it so much thought, I finally understood this. What is it? Even though you gave me a lot, I couldn’t really give you anything in return. Even if I want to give you something, I won’t be able to. You are here with me. What else would I need? Those words are very sweet to hear but they are not all that matters. Fine, I will give you something. What is it? Extend your palm. Promise. -Promise? From now on, I am always going to tell you the truth. I won’t lie to you. You mean, all this while, were you lying to me? I mean… Just a few times… very tiny white lies like… I told you that I already reached when I was on the way… Or that I was in the tea shop instead of coffee shop. Such sort of white lies. From now on, I wouldn’t tell you those lies ever. Promise. I will tell you the truth. You made it sound so serious over such small things. Lucky. Fine, let’s go. What’s this? Why are those seniors here? Today, he has to be taught his place. You always keep saying that. The one who drives the railway engine is… Hey, it’s you. When I saw you in the car that day with that girl, I thought you would end up on the road like this. But you are a little early to this condition. Young man? Young man? Sir, look behind the bus stop. Who are they? My seniors, sir. They came to beat me up. So what do you want me to do? Please help me, sir. Help? You want money now? I came on the night track. I don’t have the money. I will not be able to help you if you don’t pay me. Sir, I have an ATM card on me. -Does the card have money? Yes. If that’s the case, alright then. -Come on out. Out from there. There are ten of them. My god. Namaste, sir. -Namaste. Who the hell are you guys? Why do you have those weapons on you? Nothing sir... Alright go. Okay sir -Thank you sir. Call them back here and warn them, sir. I already told them off, didn’t I? -ATM. Hey -Sir. This man is sort of related to me. He is one of our men. If you start this behavior again… Okay, sir. Careful. ATM, sir. -Shall we go to the ATM? Shall we? Lucky, are you going on a college tour? No, mother. I am leaving this house. What?! What do you mean you are leaving this house?! I don’t want to stay in this house ever, mother. I am unable to get along with your husband. If needed, you stay with your husband. Why should I stay in this house? What is all this? Please stay until your father gets here. Why should I stay here? And for whom? Did he ever fulfill even one of my wishes? Son, please don’t be hasty. Lucky, please listen to me. Everytime I ask him for something, he always says that he doesn’t have the money. Goodness, just listen to me. -Please, mother. Lucky, please listen to me. -I am leaving.Let me go. Lucky, please stop. Please listen to me. Lucky, stop. What happened? Why do you seem so off? Nothing. Oh? Are the results out? Yes. What happened? Are you feeling bad that you scored 95 marks out of 100? No. What else? Nothing. -Just tell me. Failed in four subjects. Me? Are you feeling bad for me? So sweet. I wasn’t talking about you. I failed. What do you mean you failed? Well, calm down. You can take the supplementary exams. Why are you feeling so bad for something small? I am not feeling bad because I failed. Well, what then? I worked hard and filled up 30 pages in a span of three hours. But you wrote three pages in your exam and passed the exam. You are feeling bad because I passed? Well, how did you pass? Well, that is ANTU. I don’t understand. In ANTU, the marks are not given based on the answers you wrote. It depends on the mood in which the examiner corrects your papers. So, after completion of first year, we will immediately start with 2.1Okay. Where shall we go after? Donkey, though you have failed in all the subjects in your first year, you continue to speak in the class without listening to the lecture. Madam, that’s not what I was doing. Just get out. Get out of my class. Get out, you donkey. What is it, Laxman? Why are you checking your phone? I am not in a great mood, madam. Why is that? Is it because you failed? Don’t fret. You can take the supplementary examinations. And I am here for you. Don’t worry. Do this. After we finish the class, come to the staffroom. We will speak in private. -Okay, madam. Alright? It’s been half an hour since he went in. How much longer are you guys going to speak with each other? Shreya, -What happened? Why did it take so long? Well… -Tell me…tell me. Hurry up and tell me. Hold your.. Since I failed in the examination, she asked me not to fret over it. She asked me to come to her house in the evening for a tuition. What did you say? I told her that I would see when I am free and go to her. Really? You go on ahead. You can take care of this. I am leaving. Shreya, listen to what I have to say. I only agreed to it because she asked. Alright. Don’t speak to her again. Okay? -Fine. One minute. A useless fellow. Who is it? Yeah, there’s someone. Is that a girl or a boy? It’s a guy. He is a childhood friend of mine. Charan. I am already warning you. I am quite possessive. I cannot handle it if you speak to anyone besides me. Understood? Okay, fine. Doesn’t he have anything better to do? He cut the call again? I’ll call him again. Just…Just a minute. Why are you bringing him up now? Well, sir… Well, we promised to meet each other. Not that. Is he really important to the part of the story that you are narrating to me? No, sir. Since it’s a no, get back to the story. sir. I wanted to study hard and settle down with all the good things in life. But Shreya already gave me all the things that I dreamed of. So, I set my studies aside and started spending all my time with Shreya. One day, in our final year… This is the first time in the three years that I have been away from you. Why did you leave then? It’s my cousin’s marriage. So, I have an obligation to attend. I'll be back in 3 days. Aren’t you missing me? It’s because I am missing you that I came to the college to be reminded of our memories. Love you. Okay You never say that you love me. Why don’t you even say it back when I say it first? Okay, love you. You sound like I forced you into it. I don’t want your words. Okay, no love you. Shreya. Hey, okay. My mother is calling for me. I will call you in the night. Bye, bye. -Okay, bye. Enough about that. Why are you dressed like this? Did you think you were attending a party instead of college? I will dress according to my wishes. Who are you to tell me otherwise? Don’t harass girls. Just let her leave. Alright, alright. Leave. Go on, leave. He stood up for you. Hey, you come over. Come on here. Hello, sir. Thank you. Sir? What is that? Call me Laxman. Since you are a senior, I have to be respectful towards you. Alright, fine. Sir? -What is it? If anyone bothers me again, may I use your name? Alright, fine. Use it. I must do something and bag him. Mr. Laxman, I need to speak to you urgently. Alright, sit down. Stop calling me with such respect. I sat down here with a book. I am a student as well, aren’t I? Just call me Laxman. That’s enough. Okay What happened was… during the lunch break, someone tried to bully me and I used your name. They said just taking your name is not enough. Instead, I was told that I needed to call you. But I don’t have your number. Here, take my number down. Why is it that you are behaving that way with your senior? If you have the senior’s support in the college, the advantages that you have are completely unique. You will understand this in the days to come. Hello? -Hello? Who is this? -It’s Madhu. Madhu? Which Madhu? You saved me from getting bullied this morning. And you gave me your number in the evening. Oh, it’s you. Tell me. Why did you call me at this time? Well, I just wanted to thank you. Gosh, that’s alright. One minute. I’ll call you back. Why did he cut my call suddenly? Shreya, what’s up? Why does your phone seem busy? Who was it that you were talking to? This morning, I saved a girl from being bullied this morning. Her name is Madhu. So, she called to thank me. You saved her this morning and she calls you this evening. Is your number on the notice board? Well, actually…that girl… Alright, fine. Are you going to talk about her or do you have something else to say? What did you do at the wedding? Why is he taking so long to pick up my call? Hello, who is this? It’s me. Madhu. -Which Madhu? Didn’t you save my number? -Ah, yes. Madhu. Tell me. What’s up? I heard that you are popular in the college. Today, when someone tried to bully me, I showed them your number and they let me go. Okay. What else did they say? Well, while returning home in the evening… someone was trying to get funny with me at the bus stop. And I mentioned your name. Why is his phone busy? Madhu, I’ll call you back. He cut my call in the middle of our conversation. Hello? -Why was your phone busy? I told you yesterday about a girl called Madhu. She called me and was speaking some weird nonsense that I am quite popular in the college, etc. Why is he talking about that girl now? He knows that I am possessive. Is he deliberately trying to tease me? Hello? Why aren’t you saying anything? Nothing. Tell me. What are you doing? I am telling you the truth. That girl was trying to… You’re talking about that again? Alright, fine. Go and talk to that girl No, no. Please talk to me. Now he sees some sense. Okay, bye. Good night. Okay, good night. I am going to hook him today. There are so many backlogs. I don’t even know the name of the subjects that I failed to pass in. I wonder how I’m going to pass. Hello, Madhu. Why are you calling me at this hour? Well, I wanted to tell you something important. -What is it? Well…Don’t hesitate. Don’t hesitate. Just say it. I love you. I will speak to you again. Stay on the call. Since he didn’t cut the call, he might be considering my proposal. Hey, Shreya. -Tell me. What is your Madhu saying? Should I tell her the truth? It’s better if I do. Let’s see how he would react if I really tease him about it. Why aren’t you saying anything? She called me and said that she is in love with me. He is just going on putting up an act. I will deal with him. Shreya, are you on the line? -Yes, tell me. What should I tell her? Why would you ask me that? Just agree to her proposal. Do you really want me to? Yeah, that’s how you go about it. Just confess to her. Alright, I will tell her later. But first, talk to me. Okay, okay. What did you eat today? Okay, bye. -Okay. Love you. Miss you. Don’t miss me much. Hello? You asked me to stay on the call. The call got cut. What do you want from me? I told you that I am in love with you. What is your response to it? Alright, okay. I am feeling sleepy. Okay? I am off to sleep. Bye. Thank goodness! He agreed to my proposal. I am going to use him. What’s going on? What’s the progress of the relationship between you and that senior? I confessed my feelings for him. And he agreed to my proposal. Now, no one’s going to bully me ever in this college. How long are you going to keep this on? I am going to look for a good opportunity and try to get rid of him. Where you are? -Sweetie, look to your right. What? You set your ringtone to a caller tune. There’s no song with your name in it. That’s why I picked one out in random. He’s trying his best to tease me. I will not react at all. Shall we meet in the evening? I am already going to the movies with Madhu this evening. He’s at it again. Well, are you free this afternoon? Yes, I am free. Where shall we meet? Where else? Let’s meet at our favorite coffee shop. You finally found some time to meet me. You’ve become quite busy after Madhu came into your life. Forget about that. Let’s order something. Waiter? Something feels weird. What happened? Well, it’s nature’s call. I shall be back. You just order. Okay? Two chicken club sandwiches. -Okay, ma’am. Madhu? He’s not really that kind of person. He’s doing this to tease me. Two more hazelnut cappuccino. Someone is calling him again. It might be important. Hello, Laxman? Are the tickets for the movie confirmed? It’s IMAX, is it not? I hope they are corner seats. Should I have to call you again? Why couldn’t you pick up my call the first time? Hello? Lucky? Hello, Lucky? Say something. Hello? So, all this while he’s been telling me the truth. Where is she? I forgot the phone here? Hello? It’s good, isn’t it? The second half is even better. Did you already see this movie? -I saw it long ago. We could have gone for another movie, couldn’t we? A good movie will make you want to watch it again and again. Do I look good to you? Are you going to look at me again and again? Why get into all that? We came to the theatre to watch a movie. We are not here to look at each other. What do you want to eat? Anything light is fine. I already had my lunch. How about sweet corn or popcorn? -Popcorn? Small, medium or large? Will this size do? Yes, that will be enough. Why is no one speaking? Just break the silence! You already have a girlfriend? All these days why didn’t you tell me? I am not in love with you. Why will I tell you all these things? You said that you loved me. I just said okay. And I said okay because she told me to. Now that I know that you have a girlfriend, what else is there left to talk about? Goodbye Go away. No one here is begging you to stay. If you say something, we can leave. What? You want to leave? Does this seem like a joke to you? Just take it easy. What’s the worst that happened here? I told her what you said and I told you what she said. And now she left. Now, let’s just continue. Okay? Have you gone crazy? How could you even think of betraying me? Betraying you? What betrayal? I didn’t lie to you and there was no betrayal here. I told you everything that happened with that girl. Why go that far? How did you get to this theatre? You came here because I told you about it. And you came with a popcorn bucket. How am I in the wrong? You are saying that you did nothing wrong. Is that it? It’s your problem if you don’t believe me. That’s not my fault. Hey, where are you going? What so bad about what happened? What am I to assume if you walk away without saying anything? It’s done forever. Forever? Forever? Alright, fine. You’ve finally shown the true colors of a woman’s personality. You took a little more time than the others. Nasty girls. If not you, there are hundred thousand girls who are interested in me. Hundred thousand girls? I need two people now. Who do I call? Kiran? Charan? Haven’t you guys grown up yet? If you meet us after five years, this is how we are going to look like. Wipe your eyes first and then take a look. You’ve grown thick and hefty like donkeys. Why don’t you pick up the calls? It’s been five years. You don’t keep in touch. Do you even remember us. Where have you been living? Stop it! I am already in a bad mood and you guys are making it worse. If your mood needs a change, we need to change the location first. Even though the location’s changed, my mood hasn’t really changed. Now it’s going to change. Take a look. Do you really think that my mood would change looking at this? It will definitely improve once you have some of it. Just have some of it. How do you feel now? I am feeling better, buddy. If you have a four more of those, that ‘better’ would turn into ‘best’. What happened, buddy? You asked us to come over immediately. At least now, tell us what happened? Don’t remind me of that horrid experience. My mood’s improved. Well, what have you guys been upto? When my father was alive, he didn’t do anything for me. But before my grandfather passed away, he gave me a car. I am using it for wedding and living off the income. What about you, buddy? Even though I finished a three-year degree course, some of the subjects have been pending. So my father told me that I wouldn’t get my degree ever, I will not be able to settle down in life And I would never be able to marry. Now, he’s looked for a match amongst our relatives and is now forcing me to marry her. I don’t know what to do. That is why I used the excuse of coaching for bank exams and am now living in a hostel. Why would you get married so early? Well, my father feels that I will never be able to settle down in my life ever. He thinks that at least through a marriage, I would settle down and lay some roots. Do you think a person settles down in life once he’s married? How is that possible? Well, the dowry for the wedding is going to be 2 acres of land and ten lakh rupees. Do you think you can settle down with 10 lakh rupees and just 2 acres of land? That’s true, buddy. More than getting married and settling down… Hold on a minute, let me explain… Marriage settles….settled… Hold on, I’ll explain. Instead of settling down after marriage, isn’t it better to settle down first and then get married later? There are a lot of rich men in Hyderabad. We need to get married to their daughters and settle down in life. Looking at our faces, even if we assure them that we will pay the bride price, no one is going to get their daughters married to us. I am not talking about us going to them. Instead, they are going to come to us. Looks like he is really drunk. Buddy, don’t you believe me? Do you think I am speaking this way because I am drunk? Tell me. Buddy, I don’t think so. Keep talking. Keep talking, buddy. I will listen to you. Buddy, we are going to look for the richest girls in Hyderabad. Yes, we are. We won’t go to them. They will come to us. We will select the top three richest girls amongst them. The top girl is going to be for me. The second girl is for you. This guy doesn’t believe me but the third girl is for you. Yes, yes. For him. He’s quite drunk. No, buddy. I am quite serious. All these things don’t happen. Buddy, I am being serious. It will definitely happen. How? Let’s start a marriage bureau. Only for rich people. Yes, for sure. We are going to select three girls from all the matches that would come our way. The top one is for me. The second one is for you. And even though he doesn’t believe it, the third one is for him. Yes, yes. Definitely for him. Do you know something? What is it, buddy? I already have a name for the marriage bureau. Really? What is it? Lucky Marriage Bureau. Elite Matrimony - Only for the rich people. Rich girls. How does that sound? It’s useless asking him about this. You tell me your opinion. Buddy, it’s su… My head’s hurting. To get rid of this splitting headache, I need to have another cup of coffee. Vijay? When a girl loves you so sincerely and takes such good care of you, you break up with her and start a marriage bureau. You wanted to find a girl who’s richer than your ex and settle down in life. You are such a great man. There’s nothing wrong with you asking me if I would sell my coffee shop to you, Lucky. So, what happened after that? Sir, actually, I need to tell you something. What is it? Well, it’s already been three hours more than the one hour we agreed upon. That doesn’t matter. I am completely engrossed in your story. Tell me. That’s alright. Hello? Buddy, I came to Lucky. My life is going to be very well settled from now on. I won’t return to that village ever. That’s all. He will take care of everything. That’s it. He is there for me. I don’t have any problem. When did you guys come? Cut the call. I’ll call you back. It looks like he is still drunk. Buddy, weren’t you the one who called us yesterday and told us to hurry because it’s important. Yes, that was in the park. Now, do you remember? That’s correct. But when did we come to the room? Weren’t you the one who asked for a change in your mood. And I went ahead and changed the location. That’s right. After that, we had a lot to drink, didn’t we? Thank goodness. Now he remembers. I am safe. I don’t remember what happened after that. Buddy, don’t say that. Please. I laid all my hopes on you. I already told everyone in the village. What did you tell them? You spoke some nonsense while you were drunk. He just took your words seriously. Just don’t mind him. All my dreams have disappeared like camphor. Stop that! Tell me what happened? Lucky Marriage Bureau. Wow! I spoke such great things. What great planning I have. Our elders said that drinking alcohol sharpens one’s mind. Even though late, I proved them exactly right. May be that is why I wasn’t allowed to drink alcohol for the past three years. Perhaps of the insecurity that the ideas in my brain would come out and make me successful. She is quite dangerous. Who is she? She’s not important now. Now, this is important. Who the hell is this? I meant my plan. The plan that I made last night. Let’s go and start a marriage bureau. First, let’s eat something. Please. Alright. Everyone starts good beginnings with a bar of Dairy Milk chocolate. But we will start with Dosas. Idiot, first brush your teeth. Brother, get me the thicker chutney. That chutney is only for take away. Then, I want this in a take away. I don’t want this. Well, what do we need to start a marriage bureau? Before we start any business, we need to have an office first. You think so? Of course. Let’s go and check out some offices. Where and how? There and like that. Sir, this is the reception. -Okay. All this is an empty cabin. Okay. Well, this is all ours. It’s not ours. It’s mine. The idea was mine. Sir, this is a conference hall. Next, the work stations… -That’s not necessary. How much is the rent for this space? 70,000 rupees in rent and 5,000 rupees in maintenance. Half month commission is non negotiable. We don’t have money for maintanence. How much space is this? It’s around 3,000 square feet. 3,000 square feet? That’s going to be too small for us. Let’s do this. I need that sort of a building. I want those glass fittings, the buzz of such a building and all such. I get it. I shall take my leave. If we had those 70,000 with us, we would be able to live happily. Why would we need this office space? Looks like you are hungry. Go and have two more Dosas. Thank you, Lucky. Go ahead. Why do we need an office space? If someone wants to speak to us or if we want to speak to someone, we need a good place. That is an office. We need a good place to talk, -huh? A good place? I have a great place in mind. Come, let’s go. Buddy, have your Dosas later. -Kiran, come on. How does this place look to meet people and talk to them? We can meet with hundreds of people here. Buddy, do you know of anyone who is rich amongst your circle of friends who are unmarried? Just give it a thought. Buddy, forget about rich. There are a lot of people who are unmarried. I am serious. Tell me. No, buddy. That is why they say that it’s an advantage to have a good circle of friends. I didn’t make any friends other than the two of you. I’ve been with her during all the three years of my college and didn’t make any other friends. Such a pity that lecturer Sri Devi always was warm towards me. She didn’t let me speak to her either. Buddy, remove your hand. Lecturer? Was she friendly with you? Is she good looking? Good looking? She is stunning. She is unmarried as well. If that’s the case, why don’t you get her married? That’s right. This sounds like a good idea. She is already rich and she looks good. And she is friendly with me. Buddy, our first match is going to be her. Sir, where is Sri Devi madam? Since it’s 2:30 p.m. she is going to be in the chemistry lab. Where would she be if it’s 3:30 p.m.? She would be in the canteen. Looks like you keep track of her schedule. Who the hell are you guys? What the hell are you talking? Laxman, are you well? -I am well. Brother, we need to be somewhere urgently. So, please step aside. Who the hell are you guys? I didn’t see you in the college before. Brother, they are my friends. -Friends. Brother, the Chemistry madam is going to head to the college canteen if we a late. Please, brother. Please move aside. Hey, hold on. How do you know that Well, the chemistry madam and Physics sir… That’s a different topic altogether. Please let us go, brother. Different topic? It’s about marriage. Please move, brother. Brother, we shall take our leave. -What? A marriage between physics and chemistry lecturers? What’s going on? What are you saying? It seems physics sir and chemistry madam are in love and are going to get married. Who told you this? Nothing…nothing really. They are going to be married. What’s happening? Hurry up and forward this information to everyone. Is this true? Physics lecturer and chemistry lecturer? She is our chemistry teacher. Isn’t she good looking? -She is stunning. Yes, she is. Hi, madam. Hi, Laxman. How are you? It’s been so long since I met you. Madam, I am fine. But you need to get married immediately. Excuse me? Please get married, madam. Please. Buddy, let me try and convince her. -What are you talking, Laxman? Alright, fine. Give it a go. Madam….madam… You are so beautiful. Please get married. Please, you must get married, madam. You are really beautiful, madam. Please get married. Madam, these two here are my friends. -We are his childhood friends. What the hell is this, Laxman? Just because I was friendly with you, you think have the right to behave as you please? Is this some kind of prank? It’s not a prank, madam. I am being frank. Enough, Laxman. It’s my personal. It’s no longer personal, madam. The rumor that you and physics lecturer are in love has spread across the entire campus. How dare you? Buddy, let’s get out of here. -Idiot! Get out! Buddy, is the idea of marriage bureau no longer going to work? Must I get back to coaching for bank exams? Just quiet down. Order something and eat. Thank you, buddy. Just think about it calmly. -Waiter! Hi, Are you well? I am well. -Are they your friends? Where is Shreya madam? I will tell you all about it later. But why haven’t you been coming here for a week? I paid a matrimonial broker to arrange for a marriage alliance. They are just moving me around and introducing me to potential alliances. I paid ten thousand bucks. They didn’t show me even ten matches. Okay. One minute. Don’t worry. We will settle it for you. -Okay, brother. Good morning, sir. Welcome to ‘Get your Match’ matrimony. How can I help you, sir? Who needs your help? My buddy here paid ten thousand bucks for this service. Please don’t worry, sir. I will help you. I came all the way here because I am worried. Are you just whiling away the time with the ten grand that my friend paid you? Can I get your ID, sir? He needs your ID. Tell him. I didn’t ask for your email ID, sir. I asked for his matrimonial ID. Tell them your ID. -218265 One second, sir. Sir, you can select from these. The one behind. No, not good. She isn’t good looking either. He has a lot of profiles. If we send him out, we can take all the data from him. You take care of that. I will manage here. Alright, go ahead. I didn’t like even a single profile. We paid 10 grand. Won’t you at least give us some water? Sorry, sir. Do something and make sure he doesn’t come. don’t worry. I will take him outside. You manage it here. Take a look. Are you going to serve us just some water? We paid 10 thousand bucks. Aren’t you going to offer us a cup of coffee? Sorry, sir. How much longer do we have to wait? Sorry, sir. I will go and get him. Such disrespect even after we paid ten grand for this service. -We aren’t valued here at all. Buddy, take it out. -Take it out. Transfer the data. Go on ahead. -Hurry up. Transfer the data. Come on, hurry up. He’s going to be here. -Hurry up. Sorry, sir. Ten minutes, sir. -It’s okay. You made us pay ten grand and you want us to wait ten minutes for a coffee that’s worth a mere ten rupees? If not this service, let’s head to another one. Let’s find another one that’s even better than this. Let’s go, guys. Why are they so frustrated over a cup of coffee? Buddy, we managed to get the data but I don’t know how to proceed with this information. Good morning, brother. -Good morning. What’s going to happen to me. Don’t worry at all. I will take care of everything You go about your work. I am on it. Alright, brother. Buddy, go back. Go back. Do you know him? He is the son of the MLA from our village. Give me his details. You have all that information in the biodata that down below. I am not asking about him. I am asking about his father – The MLA. The MLA is a very nice man. He is very religious. He constantly performs pujas. No matter who goes there seeking whatever help they need and at whatever time possible, he would immediately help them. Let’s go. Where to? -Let’s go meet the MLA. That is all well. How are we going to go meet him? I have my grandfather’s car. Which car is it? Remember that car we used to sit in and talk? We are the ones who called you. Please get in. Why does this car look like this? Are you wondering why this car looks like this? You must have seen Audi, Benz and BMW. But this is LMBC. Lucky Marriage Bureau car. It’s going to be thrilling. Get in. -Whatever nonsense it may be. Let’s just go. Hello, priest. Namaste. -Namaste. Namaste all. -Let’s go. Since when are you so courteous? Ever since I got into this car. Are the subsidies reaching you on time, lady? If that’s not the case, please call me. I shall take my leave. -Namaste, sir. Good morning. Namaste, sir. Namaste. Sit down, please. Thank you, sir. You said that you are from our village. I thought you might have a problem and so gave you an immediate appointment to meet with me. Thank you, sir. Sir, actually, the reason why we came here not to talk about our problems. We came here to help you with your problem. My problem? I don’t have any problems. Of course you do. Sir, for the past two years, you haven’t been able to find a proper alliance for your son, isn’t that the case? Well, I couldn’t find any matches that both my son and I liked. That is why we rejected all the matches that were shown to us. No, sorry. You’ve got it all wrong. You are not the one who’s been rejecting those alliances, sir. It’s the planetary influence on your stars that’s making you do this. Sir, one second. The priest would explain this better. Did you see your son’s? -What are you talking about? I was talking about the astrological chart. He is an Aries and so are you. Perhaps that’s the reason why you are in this predicament. If he had gotten married in the last two years, he would have ended up dead. Why is he ruining this? Priest, stop that. I will explain it to him. Sir, what the priest was trying to tell you is that… If your son doesn’t get married within a week’s time, your son might never get married all his life. What? In a span of two weeks? We didn’t get any closer to agreeing on a match for the past two years. How is that going to happen in a week? Of course, it’s going to happen. We are all here to do exactly that. Introducing Hyderabad’s number one. Lucky marriage bureau. Sir, this is only for elite people. You mean you are broker for marriages? Sir, not a broker. I am a consultant. And elite. You said that you were from our village. Who is your father? Not the village, sir. I am from the same district. That doesn’t matter. What’s your father’s name? Do I really need to disclose his name? Hello, young man? -Sir, it’s Venkateshwar Rao. Which Venkateshwar Rao? Paruchuri Venkateshwar Rao, sir. Okay. If you find a good match for my son, please bring it to our notice. Sure, sir. Thank you, sir. Namaste. I shall take my leave. Let’s go. -Let’s meet later. Do you always play the roles of a priest? Thank goodness! Somehow we’ve managed to get the MLA onto our side. If we can find a girl for them, the match will be fixed. Hello, if you give me my remuneration, I will be on my way. No matter how much you perform, the remuneration is going to be the same. You’ve been shouting since then. Pay him and send him on his way. What?!Two shorst? What colors? Is it the blue one or the black one? What’s with those shorts, underwear and such nonsense. Hold on. I’ll call you back. My friend’s gone out of town. So? He went back to his hometown because his family was looking for a matrimonial alliance for his sister. Apparently, that didn’t work out. He informed that it’s going to take him some time to get back to the hostel. Do you really need this conversation given the situation we are in. He is really worried that his sister’s matchmaking wasn’t a success. What was it that you said? I said that my roommate is feeling awful that his sister’s matchmaking wasn’t a success. Sister…..marriage. Is the family rich? Yes, they are rich. In fact, my roommate is the richest guy in the hostel. Why didn’t you tell me this before? It’s only been a month since I’ve joined that hostel. Call him. Call him. Hold on a minute. I am calling him. Buddy, start the car. Come on, let’s go. Horrible thing! It doesn’t open when needed. I’m going to climb in. Buddy, start the car. Hurry up and go. Keep moving. The phone’s engaged. Just hold on a minute. What happened? Hello? -Have you run out of balance? Hello? -Is there no signal? You guys look like you are still in college. How are you guys eligible for match making? And for people who are rich like we are. I don’t believe. Sir, one second. Hello? Sir, this is Laxman from Lucky Marriage Bureau. Yes, tell me. -Sir, what are you expecting in terms of dowry for your son? I already told you that I don’t need all that. If the girl is good, that’s enough for us. Okay, sir. By this evening, I will send you some good profiles. Okay? Okay, send them to me. Okay, sir. Bye. Who did you think that was? He is an MLA. The clients that our company deals with has a certain image and class, sir. Would you like me to arrange for an alliance such as this? Why “Such as this”? Why can’t you fix us up with this match? In times such as this, that man has said no to dowry. Such a good person. May the marriage happen in a week’s time. Sir, Namaste. Hey, Laxman. It’s you. Sit down. -It’s alright, sir. You send a goddess of wealth to our house and how can I have you standing there? Sit down. It’s alright, sir. I wanted to speak to you regarding the payment. Oh, sorry. One minute. I forgot about it. The marriage happened in a week’s time and it was such a busy time… You know how it’s like, don’t you? -Yes, sir. Give it here. Here. I’ve already written down the cheque for you. Thank you, sir. If he’s given us cash instead of a cheque, I am sure it’s big bucks. Sir. What is it? There’s an extra zero in this. Read the words that match the amount. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Bye, sir. I shall take my leave. You are harping on that zero. By some misfortune, did he write a thousand in there? Buddy, are you shocked? -Ten lakhs? You are great. Buddy, you are truly awesome. You’ve earned ten lakhs in a week’s time. It’s no easy task. You are simply great. Not just this. There’s some more money to be collected. Let’s go. What brings you by? Sir, the payment. Rahul, bring me the cheque book. Would 50 thousand or one lakh suffice? As you please, sir. Well, how much did my in laws pay you? -Ten lakhs I don’t believe you. It's true sir, If the matrimonial alliance is made by someone they are usually paid 50 thousand or one lakh rupees. Ten lakhs? I don’t believe. -You have to believe, sir. Here, sir. It’s as he said: ten lakhs. If they gave him ten lakhs, at the minimum, I must pay him 12 lakhs. Shall I give you twelve lakhs? -As you please, sir. Look how I managed it This success and this party are dedicated to our Lucky. Do you really need to point out the obvious? Are the bottles ready? -Here, there are. What about the opener? Buddy, all that we need is here. Everything is ready. Let’s just start drinking. Please, buddy. Once our buddy gets off the phone, we can start the party. I shall take care of it, sir. Why are you on a call at this hour? Bye, sir. It’s an MLAs acquaintance. He wants me fix a match for his offspring. Buddy, everything is ready. Shall we start? Of course, we shall. But there’s something missing. What is it? -One second. Voice recorder on. -What’s that recorder for? Just like that day, once I drink, my creativity and plans would start pouring out of me and I might end up forgetting them. What if you guys end up using them? That is the reason why the ideas are mine and I am just being safe about all this. Well, who is the guest for the opening? Do you know of anyone who’s luckier than me? Luck said hello, hey moon Gave a hug and said come on, hey moon Oh my God overnight, hey moon He turned a rich kid, hey moon Fate changed and route changed Top to bottom style has changed New charm came over the face God witnessed his fame going great Goddess Lakshmi is sitting over his head It is a festival, whole life is a colourful festival Lucky Laxman! Lucky, lucky, lucky… Lucky Laxman! Lucky, lucky, lucky… Lucky, lucky, lucky… Lucky Laxman! Now, the girls who are rich fall in love quite quickly. And they find it hard to break the news to their parents. We will scout for such girls and go to their parents. We will go to their parents and set the girl and the guy up as match making proposal. So, parents would feel that they are agreeing to arranged marriage while the children here consider it to be a love match. Exactly. So, you mean to say you need to go to them? That’s not necessary. I’ve already put two detectives on this job. Buddy, you are awesome. Good morning, boss. Good morning. Brain is sharp, he draws a map He is the greatest hero He doesn’t give a gap and never takes a nap He rocks always ramp This brain and the currency bundles We can’t count, hey God Lucky time came straight And has gone flat over him, hey… Lucky Laxman!

Luck said hello, hey moon Gave a hug and said come on, hey moon Oh my God overnight, hey moon He turned a rich kid, hey moon We need to interact with them. We need to find out what their requirements are and the kind of girl or guy they are looking for but end up sending them only one photo. What if they don’t take the matter further? We are counselling them. He knows public pulse greatly He’s so smart So many files and business deals Wallet has gone very heavy So many plans, none can imagine about Life isn’t empty Whatever he touched has turned into gold So many turns twists in the future, hey Lucky Laxman! Lucky, lucky, lucky… Lucky, lucky, lucky… Lucky Laxman! Lucky, lucky, lucky… Lucky, lucky, lucky… Lucky Laxman! Good morning, sir. No…no…no… Let’s not waste time by wishing each other a good morning. I hate wasting time. Come to the point. Sir, if you could tell us your requirements, we would show you the suitable profiles, sir. I have 300 crores. If the girl has a net worth of 500 crores, the total’s going to come up to 800 crores. We will spend our lives in happiness. Do you have any expectations regarding the qualities that the girl ought to possess? I mean… If the girl’s net worth is 500 crores, why would I bother with her personality? Okay, sir. Very soon, I will be able to fix you up with a good match, sir. We have come to the first anniversary of Lucky Marriage Bureau. Exactly a year ago, we didn’t have enough money for maintenance either. From that situation, we are now in a position where we bought the office as well. Our Lucky’s USP is luck and a brilliant mind. Lucky, you have ensured that we are never tensed or worried about our future ever again. We started the marriage bureau to get married to girls who come from wealthy backgrounds. We decided on marrying a girl with millions because we didn’t have a penny to our names. But we ourselves are earning millions. Why do we need to hurry? Let’s marry whoever is right for us. Okay? Time waste…Time waste… I don’t like. I avoid. But, Time waste likes me. I can’t avoid. At the very least, you could have wished me a ‘Good morning’. Isn’t wishing each other a waste of time? We’ve already wasted one year, brother. Sir, you want a girl whose net worth is 500 crores. And those in the 500-crore club want someone who is in the 1000-crore club. But you have only 300 crores. So, it’s difficult to find a match, sir. Well, if that’s the case, can’t you set me up with a girl whose net worth 300 crores? Okay, sir. I will try. Try? Hey, why are you coming inside? Why are you so anxious? Do you have indigestion? Hello, do you know where you are? Do you even understand what’s going on? Isn’t this a marriage bureau? This is a marriage bureau. But it’s not for someone like you. It’s only for the rich. -Show them. Is this enough? Hello, sister? -Who is your sister here? I mean…sorry, madam. Please come inside. How dare you call me inside? Madam…Madam… Sorry. Let’s sit down inside and talk. -Buddy, stop it. Come on in, madam. -Sorry, madam. Tell us, madam. Are you looking for a bridegroom for your daughter? Do I look like someone who has a daughter? Is it for your sister? -My sister? What do you mean? Guys, keep quiet. Sorry, madam. They are quite generous with their tongues. Tell us what kind of groom you are looking for. I want someone who wakes up at four in the morning. Why? We have buffaloes in our house. They need to be cleaned. How many buffaloes do you have? I have about 50 of them. What else do you have? I have 300 goats, 300 rams, 40 cows, 20 buffaloes and many more such animals. Is that all or do you have something else? I have 10 pigs that are exactly like you. -Forget it. Other than the animals, do you own any land? Why do I need to answer to him? Why don’t you tell him? 100 acres of mango orchard and 100 acres of coconut orchard. You forgot about the corn fields. They amount to around 20 acres. Sorry once again, madam. Are you expecting any bride price? Why would I need bride price? We have a lot of wealth ourselves. What kind of a guy would you like as your groom? Fool, I just told you. Why are you asking me about this again? Fool? I didn’t understand. I was distracted by the nonsense they were spouting. Could you please repeat that once again, madam? He needs to wake up by 4 in the morning. He needs to clean all the buffaloes, milk them, feed them grass and their usual fodder mix, and their shit… He needs to clean up their shit. Shit? He needs to take them to the fields and put them to plowing the fields. And most importantly, he needs to take very good care of them. Madam, what I understand from this conversation is that you don’t want a husband. You want a servant. Go and search for him. A man-servant would help you milk the buffaloes. Years are slipping by. Why can’t I find a good match? Sir, no one is willing to entertain your proposal because of your net worth of 300 crores. What about those with a net worth of 100 crores? It’s difficult, sir. We’ve already given it a go. What about 30 crores? Sir, I will try it. I don’t think we can do anything more than this. Someone in the 30 crore club needs to be convinced? When people come to us asking for profiles of potential partners, they ask for their social status and personality traits. You are only interested in the money. That’s making things quite difficult, sir. Since I have lowered my expectations to 30 crores, why don’t you try again? What is it, father? -Marriage. Why do you always nag me to get married? For the past four years, you’ve been doing fine. What happened to you suddenly? The proposal is for 2 crores and 20 acres of land. Should I get married for 20 acres of land as dowry? Of course. Father, if you keep this up, I will not come back to the village. Son….listen… For the past one month, he’s been continuously nagging me. Hey, good morning. Forget about the good mornings. What happened? Did you not eat Dosas today? You seem very downcast. That’s not it. -Then what is it? For the past one month, my father has been cornering me about getting married. Didn’t we already decide on a plan? Why are you worried still? Buddy, my father is not convinced. Please do something and fix me up with a good match. If not, my father is going to look for someone in the village and get us married. Even if they fall short of a few crores in dowry, it doesn’t matter. Hurry up and set me up with a good match, Lucky. Please. Why are you worried when the Lucky Marriage Bureau is at work? I will send you a profile through WhatsApp by tomorrow evening. But you need to get the commission ready. It’s best to segregate business and friendship. What happened, buddy? You’ve cleaned up really well. Smart watch…Smart looks… Did you brush your face with some powder as well? Stop it, buddy. Buddy, I forgot to tell you something. First, delete the photo that I sent you. Why buddy? I am going to send you another profile. Check it. Who is she? The photo that I sent earlier is of a girl who had a net worth of 200 crores. Yesterday, her shares lost 50% of their value. Now, she is worth only a hundred crores. The girl’s profile that I sent you now is worth 300 crores. Their shares have been stable for the past three years. Isn’t this better? Let’s go with this. Why did you change it just like that? I already explained why. In any case, he didn’t meet with the girl yet. Do you like the profile? -Yes, she is here. Where? Hey, hi. Hello. Don’t worry, she is quite rich. Be careful. Why don’t you stay? If I stay here, she will fall in love with me. Is that okay with you? Please leave. Buddy, go on ahead. Bye! -Bye! I mean…we are really thick friends. Sit down then. Idiots! Buddy, I forgot to tell you this. I have a bit of work at the bank. I’ll just go there and be back. You head on to the office. Alright, take care. There isn’t even a water bottle in the car. How much is it? -Just a minute, sir. Sir, 40 rupees. Hey, what is this? Is this complimentary? No, sir. We don’t have the exact change. Is that so? Hold this. Give me back the 50 bucks. Here, take it. Sir…money… Didn’t I already give you? This is a chocolate, sir. -Well then, what is that? We didn’t have the exact change, sir. You mean to say that if you give me a chocolate, I must accept it. And if I give you a biscuit, you will not accept it? It’s not like that, sir. -What do you mean? I gave you the chocolate because -I didn’t have the necessary change. Since you didn’t have the exact change, you gave me a chocolate bar. Sir, this is worth ten rupees. -Forget it. Call your manager. Why take this to the manager, sir? Just call the manager. Sir, please. -I don’t want to talk to you anymore. Please call your manager. Madam? Yes, what is it? Did I really see it right? Is she really Shreya? I don’t understand what’s happening. What could have happened? Given the dirty look she threw at me and didn’t say a word, I am certain that it’s Shreya. Four years ago, when she left me, she had the same look. What could have happened? It’s not that difficult to find out. Let’s get to the bottom of this. Detective Damodar reporting, boss. Damodar? -Boss. I need the details of a girl. -Tell me, boss. I don’t want my friends to find out about this. -Okay, boss. Alright, I will share her photo with you. Take a look. What nuisance is this? Why is he calling me repeatedly even though I keep cutting his calls? Hello? Good morning, sir. It’s the reception. Sir, your father is on the line. If my father wishes to speak to me, he would call me. Why would he call you and ask you to connect to me? Anyhow, I don’t have a father. If you connect me with such calls in the future, you can go ahead and look for another job. Thank you. -I am sorry, sir. What happened? He isn’t even acknowledging the fact that we are still alive. What do you want me to do? If I call him, he doesn’t pick up. When I go to meet him at his office, he is instructing his employees to turn me away with the excuse that he isn’t at the office. He is doing the same thing when you call him as well. Yes, Damodar. -Tell me. Sir, that girl is very wealthy. Three years ago, her father provided collateral to their relative’s company. And that company went bankrupt in a year. Since her father provided collateral, his wealth was attached in the court cases. The case has been in the courts for the past two years. The decision is likely to be in their favor. But it takes time, sir. What about the girl? After the incident, the father suffered a heart stroke. He became bedridden because of the deeds of their relatives. She is working as a store manager to take care of the family. she broke up with a guy and went into deep depression. She was unable to finish her graduation. Since she doesn’t have any other options and she has to take care of her family, she is working as a store manager at the super market. Oh, really? I don’t know the details regarding the guy she broke up with. I will find out the details by this evening and give you a call, boss. That’s not necessary. Don’t tell my friends about this. Okay? -Okay, boss. So, Shreya is poor now. Why isn’t she out yet? Hi, Shreya. What is it? What made you come by? Are you here to make fun of me because of the state that I am in? But, you helped me a lot by giving me a bike, laptop, mobile and… What else did you give me? Yes, clothes. Penthouse, etc. So? Hold your horses, I am getting there. When I was not in a good place, you gave me everything. But now, you are not in a good place. You are going through a lot of hardships. That is why I wish to do something in return. Did you see? That day you told me that I was in the wrong and left me. But now, look at where I am and look at where you are. But still, I am still the same good Laxman. I wish to give you ten times more that what you gave me. Take it. Have it. Have fun. Don’t fold it like that. The signature would fail to match. Even though she lost her money, she is still as arrogant as ever. Hi, Miss. -Hi, sir. You can call me your elder brother. That’s alright, sir. I am not here representing your parents. Actually, at this company, the number of love marriages are more than the arranged marriages. We use the excuse of counselling to talk to the kids but we turn love matches into arranged ones. If you need such help, you can tell me. We can work it out. That’s nice, brother. If my father thought exactly like this, we wouldn’t have such a situation on hands. It’s alright. Who is that guy? I shall take care of it. His name is Aravind. What about his father’s name? His name is Laxman Rao. Oh, it’s my name as well. What does he do? You mean Aravind or his father? His father. He works as a clerk at SBI. What about Aravind? he will be able to secure a salary package of a minimum of 20 lakhs per annum. What does your father say about this? He told me that if I get married to a guy of his choice, he would be earning 20 lakhs per month. Whereas the guy I wish to marry would only make 20 lakhs per annum. He compared the two scenarios and tries to convince me. When I told him that I am not interested, he arranged for this counselling session. Isn’t your father right here? How is he right? Let me explain. If you get married to the guy that your father selected for you, Your life is going to be very happy. But if you get married to the guy of your choice, if he gets a job at a call center or he is in between jobs, what’s going to be your situation? Are you going to talk exactly like my father does? Listen, brother. Oh, I am sorry. Listen, Mr. Laxman. If a person has money, he might live a comfortable life. But if he marries the person he likes, life will turn memorable. Money only gives materialistic things. But only love can give the happiness that the heart desires. These are things that people like you and my father who are only concerned about money would never be able to understand. You might have earned a lot of money. But did you earn the heart of even a single person in your life? If you turn and look back on your life, you will notice that you don’t have even a single person in your life. Earn the love of at least one person in your life. You would understand how lovely your life is. If possible, earn the love of a girl. Come, buddy. sit down. What happened, buddy? Didn’t you sleep well? Why do you seem so down? I have no peace, brother. I know of disco Shanti and Vijay Shanti. Who is this peace, brother? Don’t joke around, buddy. I am being serious. What happened, buddy? She isn’t the right girl for me, buddy. She is worth 300 crores. What more do you want? To be with a woman, money is not the primary requisite. Compatibility. I don’t understand what you’re saying? What exactly happened? After you guys left me at the coffee shop… Hello? Since this is our first meet, Couldn’t you have planned it in a better place? Well, this place is quite sentimental for us. That is the reason why we planned this date here. Let’s move to another place. You are meeting my friends tomorrow, aren’t you? -Yes. You must wear a Burberry shirt. Okay. And…wear a Balmain Paris pants. Okay? Madam, coffee. I am on the phone. Don’t you have any sense? Put it there and leave. Should I pour you a cup? I already told you once. Don’t you get it? Get lost. Go away. Were you talking to me? -Not you. And wear a Rolex watch. Okay? Since you are meeting my friends for the first time, don’t plan the meeting at that pathetic coffee shop. Book fine dining. See you. Okay, bye. -Bye. I called you yesterday and told you to wear a Burberry shirt. Why would you wear these kinds of clothes and come here? Since you told me this last night, I didn’t have time to shop. Alright, fine. I called you and told you to book a good place. Why is this place like this? I mean…this is quite natural and open. That is why I planned the meeting here. The food here is really good. Right! You did such a good job. It’s true. The food here is quite tasty. Forget it. Don’t ruin my reputation in front of my friends. Hey, guys. -Really sorry. This place has some really good food. So, we planned here. Meet my fiancé, Kiran. -Hi. Shake their hands. This place… Damn it. You ruined my reputation in front of my friends. I already called you about this. I texted you about this. I told you about this this morning as well. And you ended doing nothing of what I asked you to do. Why is this place like this? Goodness, girl! I give up. Eat the food that you want to. Go to the place that you want to go to. Go wherever you want to. I can’t take this. I am leaving. Well, you understand things better only after you experience them. She is really not at fault either. She grew up with a lot of money. It’s my fault for wanting to be with a girl like that. Buddy, how arrogant of her! She wanted me to wear Burburi shirt…Burburi shirt! It’s not Burburi. It’s Burberry. Whatever! Do people continue their married lives based on the T-shirts that one wears? Forget about it. All the wealthy girls behave in the same manner. Hey, not everyone is like that. Only a few are like that. Really? How do you know that? -I am saying it because I know about it. Really? Who is this girl that we know nothing of? Shreya. It’s that girl from before we came to our senses. Buddy, give me that bottle. Buddy, I will be back after I use the washroom. It’s urgent. I’ll be back. Do not believe them. Do not believe the girls who are rich. If you do believe them, they will ruin your lives. Buddy, is he done with narrating the story? We are safe. Let’s get him to bed. Lucky would be better able to advise us. Let him come down. He will come down soon. Why didn’t you guys go to the office yet? We would like to discuss something important with you. That is why we were waiting for you to come down. We can talk about it later. -Come here. Let’s talk about it. Alright, fine. I’m coming. He is coming here, is he not? Hold on.Why are you still anxious? He is going to say that I am right. Let’s talk to him. -Alright, fine. What is it? Buddy, I am still confused about something that happened in the party last night. I am saying that we should find another girl who is rich and get him hitched. If the groom and the bride are in love, they will get to know each other very well. So, there will be no problems there. Since we own a company that sets up matrimonial alliances, how would it be if we go after a love match? Lucky, please talk some sense into him. He is right. How is he right? It would be better if he is in love with the girl and then get married. Yes, talk some sense into him. What is it, buddy? Are you still hungover from last night’s party? No, buddy. I am quite serious. In his case, he’s talking that way because of what happened with that girl. Why are you talking about love and such things? Life is all about ambition; not relationships. This is exactly what you told us. That’s correct. Ambitions are only until we see success. But relationships are for life. What’s going on, buddy? You are philosophizing about love and all. Today, he is giving us the very same counselling that he gives our clients. If there were really such sort of women around, why is it that we haven’t all through these four years? Sometimes meeting them might be delayed but meeting them is a certainty. Really? What do you say, buddy? At times, even when we meet them soon in life, we won’t appreciate their worth. Who did you meet and whose value are you talking about? What happened? Tell us. Nothing at all. Lucky, you are hiding something from us. Please tell us. Lucky, tell us. -Nothing at all. At least, tell me. Will you tell us or not? Please. Shreya. A girl was sincerely in love with you. She questioned you about why you kept speaking to another girl. Just for that reason, how could you have let her go and started a marriage bureau instead? What I don’t understand is, if you were in her place, how would you have reacted? What if that girl spoke to another guy and kept telling you all about the guys she’s been speaking to, what would you have done? Tell me. What would you have done? Forget it, buddy. Don’t say a word, Lucky. Go and apologize to that girl. What are you thinking about? Go and apologize to her. Shreya? What is it this time? Are you going to give me cash or card? Looks like you haven’t forgotten what happened. Forget it. When we broke up, we were both at fault. That was an immature decision. Let’s not apologize for it now. Please. Let’s start our relationship once again with a fresh start. Shreya, listen to what I have to say. Lucky, what happened? Tell us. Did everything work out well? What did she say? She didn’t say even a word. She just shot me a dirty look and walked away. The mistakes you made weren’t little. Of course, you have a lot to account for. That girl didn’t slap you. You should be happy What do we do now? What can we do? Try and convince her until your patience runs out. You must beg until she accepts you. Do you think so? -Yes. Let’s go. Lucky, it’s not time to be worried; it’s time to be sorry. And both of you marry. Let’s go. I am very sorry…I am very sorry… My sweetest girl, don’t look at me angrily with those tear-filled eyes. I am very sorry…I am very sorry. Just keep making me chase you while you keep slipping away, Please forgive me this once I am requesting you to talk to me. Baby, I am pleading with you in all honesty. Please, calm down. My dear girl, in my heart, I only want you. Oh my dear one, I keep following you around. Oh, my dear girl, I cannot let you go. You are a blessing to the eyes, that press on my hands. What should I do to make your anger subside? Dear one, if we do not fight, we are not in love. If we learn to let it go, our story will reach a happy ending. Don’t say shut up and shut me up. Don’t say get out and make me go away. Don’t lock me out of your love. My dear girl, in my heart, I only want you. Oh my dear one, I keep following you around. Oh, my dear girl, I cannot let you go. Don’t glare at me, don’t hold grudges. Everyone’s watching us, please don’t make a fuss. Why don’t you listen to me? Why do you bring it a situation where it’s the last straw that broke the camel’s back? Don’t prolong this fight. Don’t turn this into a small storm. Magical girl, please don’t fan my flames. Don’t be so dramatic. My dear girl, please don’t harass me any longer. Please come to me. My dear girl, in my heart, I only want you. Oh my dear one, I keep following you around. Oh, my dear girl, I cannot let you go. Stop this. Why are you following me around and irritating me? Thank you for agreeing to speak with me. And I apologize once again for what I did back then. Of course, you might be angry with me. But let the bygones be bygones. I want you. I cannot see you like this. Please come with me. I will take really good care of you. You want me to come to you so easily? Yes, come with me. My parents are dependent on me. What’s going to happen to them if I go with you? Do you really need to discuss them? If they made right decisions, would you even be in the position that you are in now? If I was with them, would I be in the position that I am in now? I am happy and successful because I am not with them. So, it’s better if we don’t speak about them. It’s better to not talk about them. And it’s better if I don’t talk to you. That’s because I thought you changed. I thought you came to me because you understood the value of relationships. But you are still the same. That’s not what this is. Please listen to me. You don’t have to accept my parents. And you absolutely have no need to think about me either. That’s because the one who is willing to accept my parents along with me is already in my life. We will be married in three days. Since you say you are in love with me, and if you truly wish that I am happy, I would truly like you to vanish from the rest of my life, just as you did for the past four years. I will be happy for the rest of my life. So, if you really love me… Please leave from here. Don’t let me see you ever again. Please leave me, Laxman. Please. When I understood that Shreya would no longer be in my life, I didn’t know what to do. That is why I came to this coffee shop. When I sat here, I felt like she was sitting right in front of me. For the sake of her memories, I wished to buy this coffee shop, sir. Even if the reason is pathetic. The story is really engaging. So, what do we do now? How much are you willing to pay for this coffee shop? Sir, the price… -Hold on. One only thinks of memories with a person when the other person is dead. As long as she is alive, wouldn’t it be better to stay with me? I mean to say, if your love is true… You could have tried to convince her until the day she gets married, So, when you are giving up so easily, how can you call it true love? You are right, sir. She is giving me a lot of reasons to push me away. But does that mean I should let it go? She could give me a hundred reasons to reject me. But I have only one reason that could convince her. My love. Every time she rejects me, I am going to shower her with more love. Bye, sir. I need to go. Hello? Don’t you want the coffee shop? Just let it go, sir. Alright, as you wish. One minute. I need to tell you something. Thank you very much. Sorry, sir. I should be the one thanking you. Thank you so much, sir. No, no. I asked you to tell me your story in an hour so that I could send you away soon. But when I got to know that you are the Laxman of Lucky Marriage Bureau, I decided to listen to your story, no matter the number of hours it takes. I didn’t get you. Two years ago, my friend’s daughter had problems with her marriage. That is when my daughter decided that she doesn’t want to marry. As her father, I couldn’t really force her. That is when I got to know about Lucky Marriage Bureau. I took her there. She agreed to get married and she got married too. When I came there to pay the fees, I also wanted to meet the person who helped her make up her mind. But that day, he wasn’t there. Two years later, the very same Laxman who counselled my daughter, came to me and discussed his love problems with me. Today my daughter is very very happy. The thanks that I was supposed to say on that day, I am saying it now. Thank you very much. You are welcome, sir. Thank you. Where is Shreya? -It’s her weekly off today. Do you know where she lives? I do know that. But what have I got to gain from telling you? If we have a daughter, I will name her after you. If so, fine. Every time she is down, she goes to central park. Alright, fine. Hey, do you even know my name? Once she agrees and once we have a daughter, that is when I will find out your name. Shreya? Why are you here again? I told you not to show yourself to me ever again, didn’t I? I didn’t come here to ask you to love me or to come with me. Oh really? If that’s the case, are you letting me go? No. Forget about you being with me. I will stay with you. Forget about me accepting your parents. Ask your parents to accept me. I am ready to leave everything behind for you. Money, marriage bureau…everything. All I want is you and to be with you. So, what you’re saying finally is that you are accepting my parents, is it? Yes. -What about your parents? Sorry, sir. Sorry. It’s broken. I am sorry, sir. It’s okay, young man. Neither of us is at fault. Sir, I hope you are alright. No, I am fine. You are Laxman, aren’t you? Yes, how do you know me? Your father Parachuri Venkat Rao is a really good friend of mine. But I’ve never seen you before. -We are childhood friends. Are you the one who fixed up MLA Venkat Ratnam’s son’s marriage? Yes. -The MLA is my maternal nephew. Okay.Nice meeting you uncle. I have some important work. Dear, since you are going that way, why don’t you drop me? Since my glasses are broken, my sight is strained. Please. -Urgent… Alright, sir. Please come with me. Thank you. Young man, how is your father? He must be fine. Any father would be ecstatic to see his son in such a remarkable position. My father is not responsible for my success. I am responsible for my success. My father did not contribute to my growth in any way. Why would you say that? How could a father not give even 100 rupees to send his son on picnic? Do you even know your father well? What else could I possibly know? He distanced his son because of being an incapable person. His poverty pushed him into distancing all his relatives. And regarding my mother… she has no choice and that is why she stays with him. Your father… If you want to talk about my father, please refrain from talking to me, uncle. Okay? I know more about my father than you do. There’s no need. Please take a cab. What the hell are you talking? Do you even know anything about your father? When you were five years old, you collapsed while playing. When you were taken to the hospital… Doctor, what happened to my son? How is he? Sorry to say this. But your son has a blockage in his artery. The chances of this happening are one in ten million. And it’s rare amongst children. If it was an adult, we could have performed a bypass surgery. But there is no treatment for children. So…I have no choice but to say this. The maximum he can live is two weeks. Doctor, please don’t say that. Please show me a way to keep him alive. Please, doctor. Okay, okay. I can understand. But… Doctor, he is crazy about his son. He’s distanced himself from his relatives because he prioritized his son over all others and spent most of his time with our son, since his birth. Even if there was no one with him, he would always proclaim that his son would always be with him. If my son is no longer alive, what will happen to my husband? There is a way. Tell us, doctor. -Tell us, sir. In the US, bypass surgery is performed legally on children. But it would cost you 50 lakhs And you need to get it done in a week’s time. There’s only 1% chance that he would make it. And with us, the maximum we can keep him alive is two weeks. That’s all. How will you be able to arrange for 50 lakh rupees so suddenly? It’s difficult to arrange for 50 lakhs this soon. But since you say it’s for your son, I shall do it. Thank you, sir. But you have to write your entire wealth off for those 50 lakh rupees. Yes, sir. Please arrange for the money. You there. You keep signing. I will bring the money. Your property is worth 5 crores and he wants to get it for 50 lakhs. He showed his true colors. He’s making money off the misery of the people. Let’s go. Let’s try to arrange the money somewhere else. Even if you pawned it, you would get 50 lakhs off of it. Can they really arrange for it so suddenly? 50 lakhs, is it? All of a sudden… It might take you a couple of days. But if you hand over your entire property, what is going to happen to your life tomorrow? Right now, saving my wealth is not my priority. My priority is to save my son. Please… What’s going on, Venkateshwar Rao? Didn’t you sign it yet? I am signing them, sir. Here. 50 lakhs. Now, sign it. I am signing it, sir. Here, take it. He used that money to take you to the US and get you treated there. It’s because of the treatment that you are still alive. Come, sit down. What’s all this, brother? You enjoyed such grandeur and prosperity. What is the situation that you are in now? Who is it all for? Is it for him? You are like this. Your wife is going through such hardships. Please don’t mind, brother. The both of you are still young. If you tried for another child, you might have had another one. Yes, if we tried for another child, we might have another child. But that child wouldn’t be this one. Just because you’ve started a marriage bureau, did you assume that you’ve become successful at life? Who would pay you ten lakhs for arranging a match? Who do you think that MLA is? He is the son of Yesu Ratnam, the MLA who stole all your property for just 50 lakh rupees. The reason that Yesu Ratnam died is because he had a heart attack out of guilty. I wanted to come home and break that news to you. But, by then, your father left the village. It’s because you told him your father’s name, he agreed to get his son married to the matrimonial alliance that you set them up with. He paid you 10 lakhs because he felt thankful towards your father. The reason that you’ve achieved success today is because of your father. The reason that the alliance you brought them was agreed to, is because of your father. You can earn how much you like with those ten lakh rupees. But if you didn’t have your father, imagine what would have happened to your life. Imagine what would have happened to your success if he wasn’t around. And look at the consequence it has upon your marriage bureau business. Your father did so much for you and this is how heinously you talk about him? Forget about all that. Even though your father did so much for you, not even once did he say that he did all these things for you. That is how great your father is. And the way you talk about him… It’s just my birth place in name. We don’t even own a single property to call as ours. What’s going on with my father? Every time I ask him for money, he keeps saying that he is broke. And when I insist, he counters that he’s spending all his money into educating me. What horrible fate! Why don’t you wait until your father comes home? Who should I wait for? And what for? Just listen to me. No, mother. Let me take care of my life. Lucky… -Please listen to me. And he keeps calling me and disturbing me. Anyhow, I don’t have a father. What happened, son? What happened? Is there a problem? Don’t cry. Nothing’s going to happen. I am here for you. What is this, father? Ever since I started remembering things, I have been hating on you. I left the house and distanced myself from you. Even when you tried to talk to me, I insulted you. You should have told me what you did for me. I didn’t do all those things to boast about them. I did that to save my son. That is what made you stand here in front of us today. You should have told me, father. Our lives would have been entirely different. Hoping that something would change and wishing that my son would change if I told him all that… I don’t like both the options. That’s because doing things is in our hands. God’s going to take care of the rest. You should have told me about this, mother. Your father said that same thing to me and stopped me from disclosing anything at all. Alright, fine. Forget about all this. I need to take you somewhere. Where to, son? I need you to meet a very important person. I’ll tell you. Come with me. Come, mother. Hey, stop. Stop. What is it? If you had agreed the other day, I might not have said this. But now, I have no choice. What is it? I will only accept you if my parents accept you. Is that so? -Yes. What do you say, uncle? Up until now, he didn’t inform me before he undertook something. Do you really need my approval for such blessed beginnings? So, can I come to you now? One minute. I really didn’t think you would agree so easily. Actually, what happened was… After I said that I was getting married and asked you to leave… Shreya. Dear girl, why did you scold him thus and asked him to leave? Don’t you know how bad he’s going to feel? Who are you guys? I am Charan. I am Kiran. So? Do you even know how much he loves you? He only wants you. Who the hell are you guys? We are his childhood friends. Childhood friends. When we were in college, whenever you guys called, he would say that you are useless people who kept calling him frequently. Was that you? Why bring up the past? He isn’t the same person that he was before. He’s changed a lot. If he spoke about you people like that when he was with me, I can only imagine how he would have spoken about me after we broke up. So, it would be better if you didn’t tell me about him. Alright, since you won’t believe us even if we say something, allow me to tell you how he feels in his own words. Take a look. Take a look. Who is Shreya? She is the first person who made me feel like I was truly Lucky. Even before I asked for anything, she would give it. She would assume every nonsensical thing that came out of my mouth to be love. Even though I put her through pain, she never said a word. When did this happen? Forget about when that happened? When she is in financial hardship now, I went and gave her a cheque. That’s the worst behavior…the worst. Even though she lost her money, her character never changed. That is my Shreya. Why go that far? She is the reason why the thought of starting a marriage bureau came to me. Even when she left me, she managed to do good for me. Today, I am very angry with God. Why, buddy? God gave an idiot like me to such a good girl. I am angry, buddy. All this while I have been single not because I wasn’t courted or proposed to. I waited because of the faith I had in my love. I was sure that my faith would change him someday and get him to understand the value of love, and bring him to me. Today, I spoke with the very same faith. But even today, he doesn’t understand the value of love. That’s because, in everyone’s life, the first love is always their parents. If he doesn’t understand the value of parents, how will he know my worth or the value of my love. The day when he realizes the worth of his parents, I am a hundred percent certain that I would accept him. Since you came with your parents, I accepted your proposal. All this happened behind my back? Yes. Well, where are those who fixed our marriage? I salute you. I will never be able to repay your kindness. I shall do something for you. I will find you a girl whose net worth is around 100 crores and get you guys married in the same auspicious time as my wedding. That would take care of things, isn’t that so? No, buddy. I am going to fall in love and get married. Just like you. Well, what about your situation? Well, if Shreya has a friend or a sister, I will be okay with it. So, none of the three of us would be getting married through the marriage bureau proposals, is it? In life, only those who have money are not the lucky ones. Anyone who has good parents, good friends and a good life partner is a lucky person. Let’s look at the profiles on Facebook and send a friend request. Lucky, what’s next for us? What is he saying? Perhaps, it’s something new. Look over there. Lucky, what is this? Lucky Marriage Bureau is no longer elite matrimony. Everyone’s matrimony. Lucky… You are awesome. Brother?You said everyone. I am okay with anyone. You said you wanted a girl with a net worth of 30 crores? I hit 30. Any woman would do. Alright, fine. Alright, fine. I shall take care of it.
