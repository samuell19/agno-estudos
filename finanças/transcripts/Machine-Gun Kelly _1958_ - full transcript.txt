- You have good time, honey? - A hundred proof, bottled and bond. - Somethin' funny happen? - Is gonna happen. The cops are gonna find Howard's hat and coat a couple of miles downstream, a gun on one road, a magazine on another. A ditched stolen car, and there'll be no Howard, no Maize, and no Kelly. And no Tommy. - Glad you had a good time. - My goodness, Teddy dear, I wonder what this is all about. What do you think the police want with us? - I don't know, Harriet, nobody's told me yet. - Just a check. - Hello, officer. Now, go ahead Teddy, dear. Now you show this nice officer your license. - I don't need your license, sir. Did you see anything of a 1931 Cadillac sedan, black, three men in it? - Did we? I think we did. Yes we did, right up the road about three miles. Or was that a maroon car? Well anyway, we saw a car with three people in it, I'm sure we did. Didn't we, Teddy dear? - Nope, we didn't see one. - Thank you sir, sorry you've been delayed. - Honey, you oughtn't look like that. You oughta smile pretty. - You know, kitten, I'm gonna get you a nice little white mouse to play with. - Capo. - See your license? Get outta the car, open up the trunk. - If there's something you're looking for, maybe I can help you find it. - No, no, give 'em the keys. Here, open it yourself. - Seems like you're pushin' hard at me, mister. That makes me think you maybe got a reason. - Go ahead, search the car. Search us, too. You think those brass buttons you got give you a huntin' permit on respectable citizens, don't you? You search 'em, push 'em around, eye up their women. - Joe, found the Cadillac sedan about eight miles off the west of the highway. - Car switch? - No sign yet, but the birds scattered. This block is canceled. - Okay. I'd like to take you up on your offer. I really would. - Darlin', you tryin' to push us into a cell? - Well, he was easy. Cops like to turn you sick scared just by starin' at you. They start you to runnin' and hide, and then they laugh in their fat guts. They beat the cement with the night stick to make you run faster. Well, that might work with booze hounds and bums and kids stealin' apples, but not with me. Not with me. Come on, let's go. - You know, sugar, the cops scared you. - You don't listen to me so good sometimes. Stop callin' me cute names and showin' your garters. - Georgie, you know I don't wear stockings. - You like to be looked at, don't ya? You like to be petted, you like soft things like silks and satins, fur for your neck. You just remember, baby. Somethin' soft'll choke you right into a soft death. Car ready for Maize? - Yeah. - It'll reach the highway in about an hour. You pick 'em up. - Okay. Uh, gas? - Fill it up. Wild Mountain, hey you got one of those overgrown tomcats in one of your cages? - Nope, it's the real McCoy, George. Caught him on a little trip about a month ago. - You're a real big game hunter, ain't you? - Time I was, before I caught the fever. Before that big striped cat in India savaged me. - Striped cat out of a bottle. Hey Harry, they tell me that drunks that slip far enough drink anything with alcohol in it, even hair tonic. You know, you stink of it. - What I say is true, don't matter if you believe me. - That's eight gallons. A buck 60. That's, uh, $201.60. - Yeah well, here's a buck six bits. You can keep the change. - Two hundred, George. - You'll get yours when the payoff's made, just like everybody else. - It's not the same. I'm a hired hand, not a partner. - Listen, great white hunter, you take the pennies when I get 'em and be glad. Or I'll have Flo here slap you silly. - Want me to, Harry? I think you'd like it. A slap's better than no touch at all. - I remember African hyenas showed their teeth just like you two, dirty smilin'. - Oh George, I'm thirsty. Leave him alone. - You know, you stink of those mangy animals, too. Go get us a couple bottles of pop. Nevermind, the stink might sweat right through the bottles. - Like to see the big mountain cat, George? - You catch him yourself? - I had a little help. - I guess. Okay let's see this big bad cat of yours. - Don't get too near the cage, he's mean. He don't like the smell of men. - Where'd you buy him? - Buy him? I caught him. Trapped him, roped him, tied him off. You know, lions'll try and stare you down if they can. And if you break, they'll make a try for you. There was a time once in Kenya, wandered about 200 yards from camp, no gun. Stumbled onto a black-maned lion in the scrub. Rose up and faced me. Why, it was a queer feelin'. Him lookin' at me, and me starin' right back at him. Then he skins his teeth once, turns around, and walks off. - Harry, you're a liar. - If you say so, George. You think you could weight him out. - I'm lookin' at him. - I mean, if he was outside the cage. - Harry, put the lock back on. - I want my 200 bucks, George. - I'd hate to lose you, you're a good man with cause. - Gimme my money, or I'll leave Maize inside the dragnet. He's a nervous man like me, and he probably talks a lot. - There, pick it up, put the lock back on that cage. - You won't be mad at me after, will ya George? I had to do it. I gotta have that double C-note. - I'm just glad to see you got some guts, now go ahead. - I was only only bluffin'. I wouldn't let him out, you know that. - You can keep the two bills. Eh, it's only a scratch. Come on, get up. You make sure you pick up Maize. - Read all about the big bank hold up. Bandit gets 41,000. - What're you making? - God of good fortune, Chinese idol. - Hm. What's that stuff? - Jade. Beautiful stone, isn't it? - Mm-hm. You like beautiful things, Howard. - More than anything else in the world. - Get away from him. - Everybody here? - Except Fandango. - Did you keep those parts? - Eh, I shoulda dumped 'em. Made me nervous. Cop stopped me. If he'd have searched me, we'd all have had it. - You mean you would've had it, don't you, Maize? - What's the sense of keepin' these parts? Breech blocks and pins are like signatures, that's why. Besides, parts are hard to get. I had to heist the state arsenal for this. - Fast. - Two minutes, 38 seconds. And blindfolded, only 42 seconds more. - My baby can handle a Tommy gun like most men can't even handle an automatic. Machine Gun Kelly's my little baby. Best gun of 'em all. - That's funny? - I was just thinkin' Machine Gun Kelly, that's a hard nickname to say. See, what would be short for that? - How about - Hello. Gee, the way you're all lookin' a me, you must've been worried sick. And that rough road you had me on just about chipped me to pieces. - Anybody stop you? - Yeah, an officer on a cycle. Tall, good-lookin' blonde fella. And very polite and courteous. We talked about my little run about for a while. He's an amateur mechanic, whaddya think of that? - Does it check? - 36,000. - Isn't someone gonna offer me a drink? My throat is just parched with dust. - Howard, get the paper. - There's some bourbon on the bureau. - Bourbon? Haven't you got anything lighter than that? Like a cordial or somethin'? - We got bourbon, you want it or not? - No thanks, I don't think so. - I think maybe you better have one. - All right, if you insist. A small shot with a lotta water. You know, plenty of body and very little spirit. - I'll get it. - Read that. - Yeah, everything worked out just fine, didn't it? - Right here, read it out loud. - The State Trust Bank of Lebanon was robbed this morning by two armed bandits with automatics and a machine gun. They got over $41,000, and the bandits ignored securities and bonds. - All of it. - Well, there is all of it. I didn't even open the black bag. - You better be nice, Fanny. - Don't call me Fanny, and that could happen, you know? You know how newspapers exaggerate and everything, and maybe it was a teller or a cashier or. - He wouldn't be dumb enough to have it on him. - He thinks he's smart enough to charm his way outta anything, this guy. - Oh, don't touch me, I tell you, let me alone. I'm, I'm, hurt, you hurt me. I'm hurt. - Yeah, that's it. One part's broken into. - What he already took, we'll call his share. - What's the matter, can't you take a little joke? I want my cut, I tell ya, I want my cut. - You already got it. - Don't you try, I'm warnin' ya, just don't try it. - Flo, give him some refreshments. Now you know Fanny doesn't like strong liquor. Why didn't give him some cordial or something? - No. - Where's the file on bank operators? - A new bunch on our backs. - I guess. - Should I try to use the weapons file? - Might as well. - I'm sorry, I didn't spot any of them. - Don't worry about it. We've got a lot more going for us than they have for them. Print files, mud files, MO files. And if they're not in there anywhere, they will be. - They wanna be known. Can't be important unless everybody knows what they've done. In a way, they actually wanna be caught. Better check on machine gun specialists now. - You still foolin' with that thing? - It's a different one. I finished the god of good fortune. This is the god of death. Ugly lookin' character, isn't he? No, hey look. What's the matter, is it hot? - You keep your junk away from me. - It won't hurt you, George. Just a symbol. It's like the skull on the bottom of poison, or the fires of death. - You know, one of these days, your educated wisenheimer ways are gonna buy you a seat on a hot rock. - Well at least you're always threatening to, George. - Are you crazy? Not here, and not here, don't shoot. And don't stay mad. George always gets upset about things like that. - And don't ask him to hold off. - I've gonna carve a map of hell in your kisser. - Don't, for god's sake, don't. - Come on. I'll stitch a new belt right across your belly. Come on. - Drop that! - Put the knife away. Open your coat. Loosen your arm, go ahead, try me. - Go, let it go, let it go. - Come on. - You're crazy, George. - Playing games? Better not be so noisy about it. There's a beat cop downstairs. Maybe he has nothing better to do than to pick you up for disturbing the peace. What's the matter, Howie? You look sick. Oh, getting thick. You'll have one that ends up in curls. How's the boss, baby? - That's me. Well, did you look it over? - Better than that. The assistant teller thought he was a real sheik. We had a talk. - I told you just look, not try and be smarter than you are. - Oh, he was easy. So was the bank. Be a lotta nice money coming in Saturday. There's a big construction outfit that pays Saturday night. The armored car makes the delivery. It's in the vault and checked out, 15 minutes later. - What about the armored car? - They leave a soon as they get the receipt. That's seven or eight minutes. - That gives us about three minutes with only the guard to worry about. - Three minutes isn't enough. - I'll work it out. We'll take two cars, two drivers, and two guns, no picking. We can use Fandango to drive. - I already stopped in to see him. He said fine. - You mean his feelings weren't hurt? - No. He said all was forgiven. Fandago doesn't forget people mauling him easy. One of his buddies who had a mad on against him told me that Fandango was waiting for a chance to even things up. - Ah. But he'll talk about this deal, huh? - Uh-huh. - Okay, Maize. You go down and talk to our friend Fanny. Tell 'em I wanna set the plan. Tell 'em we meet Harry's Gas Station about two miles. Flo, sketch out a floor plan. I'll be back after a while. - Gee, Harry oughta clean up this place. Looks terrible around here, what a mess. - Yeah it does. - Hey, where's Howard and Maize? - They already know about the plan. No sense in making this a convention. - George, you didn't tell me I was point out player this time. - That's what I wanted to ask you, Fanny. - Ask me, I don't even know what bank you got set up. - I mean the squealin' and the sound of singin'. - George, sometimes you talk in riddles. - You know Fanny, one of your friends doesn't like you. You weren't nice to him, so he's talkin'. - George, I don't like your sense of humor. - Fanny, why didn't you take the beatin' I gave you like a man? - No, no, no no, no! - Teller's cage is here, the vault's back here, guard'll be here. The alarms are here, here, and here. This door leads to the hallway. Down this side is the washroom, and the other way leads to the vault area. - We'll be to the bank the same time the armored cops are there. Gives us an extra minute or so. The minute they leave, we'll move. Right then, Howard, you ask the teller if you can use the washroom. Then go the other way to the vault. I'll be over here by the alley. - I thought you said we were in the bank. - No guts to be alone for a couple of minutes? What's the matter with ya? You want me to hold your hand for ya? I'm gonna have a chopper and a suitcase, I don't want even the chance for the guard to get curious. Now look at here. The minute that armored car leaves, I'll be in the front door with a gun on everybody that might be there, including the guard. You pick the letters, Howard, and Maize. You be across the street. Now you move right up front the minute you see me go in. - You know, even bein' in the bank to pick up time, it's cuttin' it pretty close. The construction payroll crew could arrive too soon. - Well, Flo's gonna be up about three blocks with a conked out car crosswise in the middle of the road. - And poor Floey will be sitting there with tears on her face, just helpless as can be. - That's right. - And if tears don't stop the money. I can always show 'em a little leg. - Sure, a little. - What's the matter, ma'am? - I don't know. - Well, maybe I can help you. - Shake a leg, Joe, we gotta pick up that payroll. - Get outta there! The alarm! - Florence, baby, oh it's so good to see you. - Hi, Ma. Ma, this is George, I wrote you about him. - You never could pick your men, could you? - I'm tired, and I'm hungry old lady, let me in. - Oh, ya punk. - Ma, please. - He's awfully cocky for man who can't even crack a hick town bank. - He does real good, Ma. It's just that something happened, we didn't figure on it. - I read all the clippings. The cops got a perfect description. You got a couple of months of trouble and worry. - We're clear now. Otherwise we wouldn't have come. - Okay, go back to readin' your magazines, and you wipe that chocolate off your chin. And stop eatin' 'em, you're fat enough. - This a new girl? - Shut your mouth, she's my daughter. - Ain't we all? - No respect. Oh, these young girls nowadays. Come on into the dining room, I'll get you something to eat. - You hungry, George? - Come on now, you sit right down here at the table. Now I'll fix you up some nice cold chicken and potato salad. Frank, come on in and see who's here! You know, your father was real worried about you. Would you like a little salad with that? - Chicken and potatoes will be fine, Ma. - I can heat the chicken up if you like. Say, how about a nice belt of rye whiskey, good stuff. Bonded warehouse stuff, 12 years old. - Hey, that's for me. - It's a wonder booze wouldn't make you sick. Seein' as how you served two stretches for running it in. - You tell your old lady to keep her wise cracks behind her teeth 'cause she's gonna be wearin' false ones. - I already do, smart Alec. - Ma, I could use the chicken. - Right away, have it in a jiffy. Frank, yoo-hoo! Don't you wanna come and see your daughter? - Well, you look fine, just fine. - This is a friend of mine. - Sure, Kelly. Machine Gun Kelly. Bring one along? - I always got one with me or close by. - Here have a drink. - Yeah sure, thanks. - Too bad you lost your driver in that bank job. He was a good man, so I heard. That other fella got away though, that's good. - Not so good when I see him again. - Not your friend now? - He run when he saw cops and guns. - Happens many a-time. One wrong apple and the whole cider barrel goes sour. And they can yellow out at funny times. Little things shake 'em. They're no good, you can't depend on 'em. - You know, you gab too much, I don't like talkin' to people, get outta here. - Sorry, only tryin' to be friendly. - Here we are, now don't be bashful, eat up. Not very fancy, but he food's good, and plenty of it. There ya are. Some people are makin' the headlines, not you, though. Number one boy, public enemy number one. - Just because some bum stumbles over his own feet and shoots down a couple of feds, he ain't so much. - He ain't so much. - I'd like a bourbon and water, please. I'll take it over there. - I beg your pardon. My name is Phillip Ashton, I'm a friend of Michael's. - Michael? - You call him Fandago, I believe. May I join you? - Why? - There's something you might like to know. Thank you. You have a friend named Kelly. You work with two others, Maize and Howard. Howard blames Mr. Kelly for a certain large amount of money, the death of his friend, and a shallow palm. He joined with some other gentlemen in the suit of his profession. But he hasn't forgotten. He means to kill Kelly if he sees him. - How is Fandango? Thank you. - He had to lose his arm. He doesn't find it too difficult. - He tell you how it happened? - Yes. - Now what are you telling me about Howard for? - His new bunch wants Kelly to stay out of banks altogether. They say he might die. Please, allow me. - Now the whole trick is in ridin' and whippin' like this. Oh no no no, never fight a chopper, what you do is drift with it. - Oh, I bet that kicks a lot. - Plenty, but I like things that kick a lot, like pepper and cheap booze and a tommy gun, but especially a big, grown, beautiful broad. Mm, Flo sure has the nicest sister. - And that makes you my brother-in-law. - Yeah, that's a couple of relatives. There's no harm see, it's all in the family. - Mm-hm. - Hey, play somethin' steppier, will ya? Come on sister, you show me, huh? - If you say so, brother. - Go sit in the corner, girl. You oughta put a muzzle and leash on that. - Ah, get outta here old lady. - You hit me. - You wouldn't, George. - You hit me. - On the spot, Howard wants to kill you. He'll gun ya down, George, you hear me? He's in with a new bunch, they're warning you. - Everybody out. - Girls gotta right in this room. Go hold your wake somewhere else. - You get 'em out, or there won't be much good of you, either. Get 'em out. - He's no good. His wives gave him the air, didn't they? You better wise up and do the same. Come on girls, don't stay in a room with that. - Do they know we are? - No, it was you who didn't do right. Wasn't it? - You know where they are? - No, but I can find out. You weren't in the bank in time to cover the guard. - This new crowd, are they big, Flo? - Well, Howard isn't alone. - Flo. How should I handle this? - You askin' me? Somethin' scared you, George. - Yeah, I'm askin' you. - You tell me, George. It was you who did wrong. - Flo, you know how somethings get me. I can't help it. It comes all over me like a cold sweat. - Now tell me, George. You were scared, weren't ya? - Yeah, I was scared. But you're the only one knows that. I'm not afraid of anything else, you know that too, don't you? - Sure, baby, I know. - Well, I've gotta get Howard and the rest of 'em, all at one time. - Gun 'em where they hang out. Your name's Machine Gun Kelly, ain't it? Show me. - Oh, shut up, Ma. George, there's only one thing to do. I'll turn 'em in for the Lebanon job. - A daughter of mine's goin' fink? - Why should George do what the cops can do better? - Listen, this is inside, this guy's after Kelly. Then let Kelly take care. - There's a mob behind Howard now. - So all right, so let Kelly take 'em on. Unless he's yella. Run away brave boy. Tough boy, there, Machine Gun Kelly. - He isn't running. George isn't afraid of any man living. - Afraid of gettin' your hair mussed, Howard? Eh? - So they warned me outta the bankin' business, huh? We're gonna get out, all right. - Why, sugar, we doin' all right? - Eh, it's nickels and dimes. And your old lady wants some headlines, I'm gonna give her some headlines. We're gonna get into somethin' big. - What's that, honey? - Kidnappin'. - Are you sure she hasn't got anybody to meet her? - Positive. I've been watching her for two weeks, haven't I? - If she was my kid, I wouldn't let her come walkin' home from school alone. - She only lives around the block. She doesn't have to cross any streets or anything. - Looks like the last of 'em. Maybe she was sick today. - Uh-uh. I saw her go in this morning. - Well, maybe she got sick in school, and they sent her home. - George. - Funny lookin' little flapper. If I was her old man, I wouldn't pay a dime to get her back. - Smile George, be sweet. - Hi, hi. - Hello. - Don't you remember me? - I don't think we've ever met. - Oh, you can just bet we did. You were about oh, so big then. - How big? - About so. - Then I couldn't remember, could I? - Well, you got me there. Hey, you know your dad sent us to pick you up. Hop in. - I can't, I'm waiting for my nurse. - Nurse? - Yes, here she comes. - Let's go. - No, everything's set, the note's already on its way. We'll take her with us, too. Get the kid. You know, you're a very pretty little girl. How old are you? - Nine. - Come on with me. Come on, Daddy's waiting. - We're gonna take your nurse, too, come on. - I don't understand. - You don't have to. Scream, and you die. Why don't you hold the kid on your lap, you'd like that, wouldn't you? - Sit on my lap, Cheryl. - Why can't we sit in the back? - Well, this is cozier. - We'd have more room. - This is much cozier, isn't it? - We're just going for a little ride. It's all right, Cheryl. - All right you two, get out. - You're late. - We're here, ain't we? Get in the other car. - What are we doing out here? - It's all right, honey. Come on. - Hurry it up, hurry it up. Go home and get the rest of everything. - See you tonight. Kiss? - Save it. Okay, let's go. Hit the radio. You still scared? Eh, you don't have to answer. I wanna tell you somethin'. If that kid cries or squawks too loud, I'm blamin' you. There's no price on your head, so I'm not gonna worry about damagin' the merchandise. You understand what I mean? - Yes. - You seem pretty cool. Maybe you're workin' up some cute ideas. Well, forget 'em. If I see anything that bothers me, I'm not gonna ask questions or wait for answers. So don't hang any steppins to dry in the window. Steppins in the window. There's a room in there, and you can sleep with the kid. Now, whenever you want, you can fool around out here, you know, play the radio. But when I say get in there, you do it. - May we go in there now? - If you want to, but leave that blanket on the window. Keep the door open all the time, even when you're sleeping. - Cheryl won't be able to sleep very well with the light coming in from this room. - You see that she does. - We interrupt this program to bring you a special new bulletin. Camden Ohio police report that nine year old Cheryl Vito may have been kidnapped. When the daughter of steel executive Andrew Vito didn't return from school with her nurse, Miss Lynn Grayson, a search was made, and no sign of the child or the nurse was found. Authorities suspect that Miss Grayson, only a day in the Vito employ, may have been the contact for a kidnap ring. No ransom notes have been received as yet. Stay tuned to this station for further reports as they come through. - Did you hear that, huh? How's it feel to be number one suspect? Where you goin'? - To our room. - Well this time, you didn't say may I? - Aren't you a little young for Giant Steps? - Look at that, you made the great stone face laugh. I didn't know you were such a wisenheimer. You smart off with me again. - May I? - Yes, you may. You may take three butterfly steps. - We're just one great big vaudeville act, ain't we? - A ransom note has been delivered to the home of Andrew Vito. This afternoon, nine year old Cheryl Vito and her nurse, Miss Lynn Grayson, disappeared from the school grounds only a scant block and half from the Vito home. Police have not released the details of the note as yet. This station will report on them as soon as possible. - What are these two doin' here? You're supposed to be back in the city. - But the child's probably cold and frightened and hungry. And I'm not leavin' till I see that she's all right. - Listen, you kind-hearted, white-haired old granny, this ain't a weekend's fishin'. Too many people up here outta season, and the whole works can blow. - Don't bother me. - You're supposed to be back handlin' the contact. - Just came along for the ride, Kelly. I'll go on back. This way you can get rid of one of the cars, too. - Hungry? - Yeah, I am. Why did you bring a parade? - I couldn't find them. - I just brought some little things for the youngster. Gee, I could've brought some of Martha's things for you if I knew what size you were. - It's awfully kind of you to think of Cheryl. - Well, it's not her fault that Daddy's rich. Is it, sweetheart? - Are you my grandma? - Heavens no, honey. But I'd like to have a little girl like you, though. - There's only her father. She's all he has. - Guess what's in here? - I can't see it, I don't know. - There you are. Something to keep you company. - I have Lynn to keep me company. - Say thank you. - Thank you. - I'll take care of the baby doll, and you can take care of me. I don't know what you have to do with this. Please, won't you help us? - Now look, don't ask something I can't give. You just do as you're told, and the both of you'll be home before you know it. You hungry? - No. - Well the little one is. Go on, get out there and earn your keep. Go on, go ahead. Oh now, now. Look here. You don't see her cryin', do you? And she's even littler than you. - More information on the Vito kidnapping. The contents of the ransom note have been released to the press. It's on a standard Western Union form. The message cut out of newspapers and magazines. It reads, your daughter is safe, she will stay safe, as long as you follow instructions. Go to the police if you want to, but be ready for the worst if they get in the way. We want $100,000. Stay by your phone, remember the number you hear. - Okay, get your old lady and Frank outta here. - Ma is with the kid. - She oughta buy a cap and a rockin' chair. - Very funny, Georgie. - Well, I guess I better see this is clean. - How old are you? - What? - How old? - 25. - Hm. - Married? - No. - Oh that's right, they said miss on the radio, didn't they? You got a boyfriend? - In a way. - Nice guy? - Yes, - Big, tall? - Fairly. - Big as me? - No. - Is he good? You know, as long as we're here, and we're gonna be here for a couple days, there's no reason we can't get some good out of it, eh? I mean, put the kid to bed, go on. Now, don't start yellin'. You wouldn't wanna wake the kid, would you? Now, there's nothin' to be afraid of, sweet face. I just wanna show you how to live a little, that's all. You need a big man. - Okay, big man. Sit down. - That's a big gun, George. - That's right. Why don't you go outside and take a look around. - Yeah. - Thank you. - You're gonna be a lot of trouble. - This station is kept to inform about the kidnapping of little Cheryl Vito. Now we turn over our facilities to her father in hopes that her words might have some effect upon the people that have taken her from him. - I want to say to whoever has my little girl that I'm ready to pay anything you ask. I got the telephone call, but I couldn't hear the number, you hung up too fast. Please, please call again. - What's he tryin' to pull? - You know I've called in the police, but they promised not to interfere, now please believe me, this isn't a trick. I just didn't get the number. I just want my little girl back. She's all I have. Please believe me, please believe me. - That was Daddy! - People of this entire nation beg the kidnappers to do nothing in panic. There is no trap possible here. Please call again, call again. - Get bright eyes in bed, it's past her bedtime anyhow. Come on, come on! - You think you have a talent for this type of thing, Mr. Kelly? - Get in there. - Your girlfriend's back. - I heard it on the radio. - I don't like the sound of it. - It's nothing. Frank must've gotten a little nervous. - Okay, you go back and tell him to speak clear this time and do it now. - It can wait. It'll make Vito riper. - Get down to the store and call now! - Well. - We ask again that the kidnappers please call back. Mr. Vito is prepared to cooperate fully with your demands. Please call back. - Hangin's too good. - They use the chair now. - That's even better. The kind of people who do somethin' like that. Yes ma'am. - I go the wrong cigarettes. My husband smokes Camels. Better make it a carton. - The whole carton? - Mm-hm. - Yes. - We ask again that the kidnappers please call back. Mr. Vito is prepared to cooperate fully with your demands. We will repeat this every 15 minutes until we receive further instructions. - You know this kidnappin' business is awful. - Oh, yes it is. - What kind of people, what kind? - Well, hanging's too good for them. - That's just what I said, exactly. - Ah, I gotta get going. - Okay, stop around later? - Maybe. Haven't seen you around before. - My husband and I rented a cabin for a few days. - Hunting? - No. Hunting's out of season, and you know it. My husband's a writer. He writes articles. We thought he'd write better up here. - Just like to know who's about, but just in case anything happens, we can help you. Call if you need me. - Thanks ever so much. Now what? - Tobacco for his pipe? - Mm-mm, smokes cigarettes. Only one thing to do, call him up. - Oh, you can put a sack of flour in the car, if you please. - A whole sack? - Mm-hm, if you please. - Yes, ma'am. - Anything wrong? - No, I just wanna see you off all right. Woman late at night's not always safe. - I'll be careful. - How long will you be staying? - No idea. - Been here long? - Mm-mm. Got here this afternoon. - Plate from New York, huh? - From the middle of the city to the middle of the country. - Well, good night, and be careful. - Uh-huh. - You forget something? - To call in. - The little lady must be expecting to do a batch of baking bread and biscuits. - Yeah? - Bought a whole sack of flour. - Susie, this is Freddie. Just put a couple of calls through from the General Store. Where to? Just one, to Youngstown, Ohio. Susie, put me through to the state police. - I knew I should've waited until morning. - What's the matter. - A cop was in the store. - I put a call to Frank in double talk. He got the message all right. When I came back, the cop was still pokin' around the car and asking questions. - How many did you have to answer? - Oh, I don't think enough to hurt. - Wrap the kid up, we're gettin' outta here. - What for? So some cop noses around the car. Maybe he was just lonely for a good-lookin' broad. - We'll clear out to a gas station, wrap the kid up. - We repeat the message to the abductors of little Cheryl Vito. Mr. Vito is prepared to cooperate fully with your demands. - Well, here's the tracer on that Youngstown, Ohio call. It's a bar called the Blue Sky, public booth in it. - Got a man there? - I posted one as soon as I found out. The Ohio office is checking out for us. - Clinton. Okay. - They just identified Howard as one of the men mixed up in the Lebanon bank job and that Elizabethtown mess. - State boy described a Louisville paper found in the suspect car. Those two bank jobs six months ago, Lebanon and Elizabethtown. Whoever gunned Howard and the others might be tied in. One of them used a machine gun, the mob was sieved. - It's possible. Elizabethtown got Maize killed and Howard hit. Check up on everybody who knew either one of them. We need more. - A set of phony license plates, the newspaper, the description of a girl. We have them running. Let's hope they don't dump the kid so they can travel faster. - We repeat the message to the abductors of little Cheryl Vito. Your message has been received. We will repeat this every 15 minutes until we receive further instructions. - Now we can make the pickup and the first payment. Apple, you go in-- - I'll give the orders, Flo. - We planned it this way, that's why Apple's in. - Now I changed my mind. - You don't mean I'm out. - No, but we're bringin' somebody else in. - Well, you have to cut Harry in extra as is. If you didn't run from the cabin, we wouldn't have. - It was you who almost blew the lid off back at that general store. - I did? I did nothing, nothing! What about your, uh, little goof at the Elizabethtown job, eh? A coffin scared you silly. - Don't say any more, Flo. You know I don't like to be called about that. - You don't like? You silly, scared bum. Not just of coffins, graveyards and things. He's scared to die, to get hurt, to do anything. - Well everybody is, Flo, everybody. - Not like you. You were peddlin' watered down gin when I picked you up. I gave you the machine gun, the name, the reputation. I gave you a backbone. - Look, there's no locks, you didn't have to stick. - You know why? Because you were dumb enough and scared enough. I could use you, make you do anything I wanted you to. You were my gun hand. - Don't shame me, Flo, don't shame me. - I could've had 50 better than you, and I still can. They wouldn't push around so easy. - And you're the one that's scared. You're scared when your looks went, you'd have nobody. - That's right, smart guy. But I was gonna leave you after this one. I finally pushed you to the big time, big kill. I wasn't planning for you to be around to spend the money. - Flo, you're not bein' very smart. 'Cause I'm gonna kill you now. - Ah, you haven't got the guts. - There was Howard and his mob, wasn't there? - Because I made you do it. I made you beg me to understand why you were afraid of dying and things about death. I mothered you till you went out to prove to me that you were a man! Everybody knows you're not. - You were always so soft and so easy. I never knew that. - Leave her alone. Shut her up, or I'll slap her silly. - You want to be as brave as your man? - Flo baby, you want a new man now? - Sure. Sure. - Get your hands off me, I don't want your help. - I feel sorry for you, George. I never saw anybody look the way you did when she told you about yourself. - Georgie shouldn't do things like that. He's hitting old Harry again. Apple, slap the boy's wrist, huh? - Go ahead, Apple, and I'll peel and core you. - Put the gun away, George. - Yeah, you must be crazy, Flo. Well, Apple? 'Bout time I killed somebody, go ahead. - Oh, we wouldn't have made a very good team, anyway. That's how I like it, baby. - Flo, get her and the kid in the other room. - Go for your gun. Harry, you pick him up, take him outside. Harry? - Yeah? - I ain't ever gonna hit you again. - I know, George. - Blue Sky? Is Fandango there? Put 'em on, will ya? - Why you calling Fanny? - I need him for a job. - He hates you. - We're not scared of him, are we? Besides, we need him to make a pick up. Hey, Fandango? This is George Kelly, Machine Gun Kelly. I got a job for you, what you do like better, money or revenge, huh? - I'm not mad at you anymore, George. Say, you really made the headlines this time, didn't you? Where should I drop the money? Oh, all right, bye. - All right, how'd you lose your arm. - 1917, the war, you know. - You were about 15 then. - Oh? May I have a cigarette, please? Thank you. Actually, I lost it when I was a boy. Match, please. I was working in circus as a trapeze performer, and one night, I fell and smashed it badly. - Who was the call from? - What call? - The one at the Blue Sky? - Oh, that. A friend. - Who? - I told you, a friend. - Tell me again. - His name's Phillip Ashton, you don't believe me? If you don't believe me, you can go call him and check. - We will. - Well, anything else you wanna know? - No, you can walk now. - Oh, well thank you very much. Bye. - Well, that's it. You'll step wrong sooner or later. - I've got my best man on him. - Let's hope he's the pickup man. The kidnappers contacted Vito. He's all set to deliver 50,000 in cash. If Fandango's the one, we can follow him through the hoops. - He got away. - Where? - Down the hallway. - Well how did it happen? - Well, he stalled for a minute, then ducked into the ladies' restroom. - What? Yes. What did you say? - Listen, you want the kidnappers? Well shut up and don't stall for a trade. The gang is run by Machine Gun Kelly. Later on, I'll tell you where. - That call may have been from our friend, Mr. Fandango. The head of the gang is George Kelly, sometimes known as Machine Gun. - When rabbits roar, it's a bad time. - Harry? - Yeah. - You feel all right? - Okay. - You're a good boy, Harry. You know, you've been real good this time around. You're no longer a hired hand, I'm gonna make you a partner. That's right, a full partner. 1/3 of the pie is yours. - A third, huh? With Fandango, that makes four of us. - Well, Fanny won't be playin' fair. At least I don't think he will. He'll be pickin' up the money pretty soon. Why don't you take the car, go down and meet him after he gets it, see? But don't walk right up to him, follow him a little. And if he doesn't head straight for the meetin' place, you bring him in. - I got ya. - They all right? - They're both asleep. - That's good. - You worried about 'em? - I'm leavin' George. - I don't have to tell you now, hurry back, huh? - I'll hurry. - No, I'm not worried about those two in there. I was just hoping they'd sleep through so they won't know. - Know what? - When they were killed. Flo, we're not going for the hundred, we'll take 50. That'll be enough for me for a while. - You? - Oh, you know I mean us. We can stall the cops a couple of more weeks by having more instructions and messages go through. By that time, we can be out of the country. You know, all we have to do is hire a couple of blind stiffs to make calls they don't know anything about. Maybe it's better the kid won't have to bother growin' up. - You ready, Mr. Vito? - Yes. This money doesn't mean a thing to me. You're not staking out this place where I'm going. - Don't you worry, Mr. Vito. We won't make a move until we know your little girl is safe. - Well, all we can do is wait and hope the informer calls us. We could pick up Frank Ellstrom and his wife now. - Good. - Speaking. Yes. It was our little bird, gas station out on the highway. - All right, Fanny. - Oh, Harry. - Goin' home? - Yeah, as a matter of fact, I was. I gotta go pick up my car. - Good, I'll keep you company. - Oh, all right then, would you mind carryin' this for me? Because I wanna light a cigarette. - My good arm's occupied, Fanny. - Oh. - Turn to the left, get onto the highway. - Left, meeting place isn't that way. - No kiddin'. We figured you'd yell copper, so we changed our minds a little bit. - Oh, fine. It's all right with me. Where are we goin', your place? - Mm-hm, you'll be glad to say hello to your playmates, sweetheart. - Oh Harry, don't be cruel. You were following me very well. I didn't even see you, and I could hardly hear you. I guess your experiences as the great white hunter-- - Knock it off, cripple. - Okay Harry, bring your friend in. - He's our little friend. - Hello, fink. - What do you mean by that, Flo? - George, stop! What's the matter, honey, what happened? - I heard a scream, someone was screamin'. - Gonna lay down, sir? - Tell me what happened? - I was in a coffin. You had put me in a coffin! - You're crazy, honey! You had a bad dream! - I'm pretty sure you're gonna be in one. Shut her up! - Kelly, George Kelly. We're out here, Kelly. - How did they found out? - Me, me, I told 'em Georgie boy, yeah. I was weak enough to be pushed around, mangled, maimed, that's what you thought. Now they're out there, go on, go fight 'em. Go fight 'em, yeah, yeah make those dreams of yours about coffins and burials come true. - Not you, Fanny. - Yeah me, you stupid animal, me! Yeah, I told 'em, do you think when you were talkin' to me over the telephone, I didn't hear that mountain lion? That's a sound I couldn't forget very easy, could I, George? You thought you were a wise guy, huh? Wise guy! - Harry, stay away from the window, they'll shoot, they'll kill you! Harry, stay away! - You wanted the jungle, now live in it! - Harry, don't shoot, don't shoot. - They got a sniper out there. We'll all get killed. - Oh, no we won't. You out there, listen to me! The little girl and her nurse are here! You keep shootin' I will put them in a place where they'll be hit! - Are you Florence Becker? - Yes I am! - We have your mother and father in custody as accessories. It's all over, there's no place to run, even if we let you out of there. Don't do anything foolish. Let the child and her nurse go, and we'll offer a recommendation to the courts. - Did you hear that? We'll live. - You always wanna give up, don't you? - Well Flo, why die for nothin'? Just to show that we got some guts? Flo, I don't wanna show mine with my life spillin' out of 'em! - You watch it, Georgie, your shadow'll scare you to death someday! - Flo, please do what I say, put the gun down. - Uh-uh, Machine Gun Kelly. You liked being called that, didn't you? Well, I made you, and I'll make your name stick whether you like it or not. For those two dead, you'll get the chair, and I'll plead that I'm a woman, and I'm scared of you. It'll be a nice touch, huh? - I never wanted any of it. I didn't want to be public enemy number one. I didn't want any part of it, Flo. It was all your fault. It's your fault. It's your fault. - You all right, miss? - This one got in the throat. - He's dead. - You the tough man in the crowd? You got a tough name, Kelly. Why didn't you shoot it out? - 'Cause I knew you'd kill me. - Machine Gun Kelly. Come on along, Top Gun Kelly.
