THE LAST SUIT THE LAST SUIT Okay, everyone look over here. Clarita, Nico... Micaela's missing. Micaela doesn't like photos, zeide. It was my only request. One less. Why not take it with those who want to instead of thinking of those who aren't here? Dad, your leg. Cut the crap. Tzures is fine. Maidele! Maidele. Maidele, is it so hard to please your zeide? I don't like having my photo taken. Either take the photo, or leave my house immediately. This house isn't even yours anymore. Okay, tell me what you want. An iPhone 6. - A what? - It's a telephone. Like this one, a little bigger with a digital print. What's the damage? You can get one in Miami for 1,000 dollars. You're mishiguene! I can't give you that much, sweetie. I'll give you 200, come on. I don't like having my photo taken. Get this into your head. This photo is for those morons at the retirement home so they'll think my great grandchildren love me! I'll give you 400 and that's that. I don't like having my photo taken. 600, not a peso more. That photo is worthless if I'm not in it. You lost the 600. I'm sorry for you because you're an idiot. Eat shit. I'll give you 800, but you're robbing me. Not a peso more, your mom can pay the rest. Okay. You disappoint me. You gave in too quickly. I had the 1,000 dollars to give you. I lied. It doesn't cost 1,000. It costs 600. I've even got 200 left over. You know what you are? You're... You're the favorite! The favorite! Whiskey! - We already settled this. - But it's perfect for my house. Okay, Sergio, but that's it. We already decided. What's eating the two of you, may I ask? We talked to Besuievsky. They'll have to decide in the operating room. Your leg is worse than they thought. They have to see if they can save it. Tell Besuievsky not to create problems were there aren't any. Tzures is fine right here, where he is. First you send me to the retirement home and then you take away Tzures. How nice. What do I do with this? - You need to rest your leg, Dad. - Cut the crap about my leg. Listen up. We're going to say something. - Tell her to come in. - She's with the kids. We're going to be fine. Sometimes we old people don't accept our age. But we don't want to be a burden for anyone either. So... we're going to face the time we have left to live with gratitude and joy. The best decision you've ever made. Then you'll understand that we're a little tired. And that we want to be alone to say g00dbYe to the house where we lived the last 50 years. Of course we understand, Dad. We'll pick you up at 10 to take you. Don't you want to come eadiefl? Come earlier. Come, we'll be waiting. Me and Tzures. We'll go together. Bye. Come on! Come inside! Bye, dear. - Bye, zeide. - Say goodbye to zeide. Bye. I love you very much. See you later. - Bye, beautiful. - Come on, David. - Bye. - A kiss. You want me to stay tonight? No. I don't agree with what they're doing to you. We'll be okay. Claudia would never do this to you. I don't know any Claudia. Paulina. Shalom. Where to, Grandpa? Want to tell me? I'm not your grandpa. It's a way of speaking. Sir. Sir. Sir, are you listening? Lavalle between Junin and Unburu. Excuse me. Do you mind if I smoke? Every man picks his own cancer. Now when we get there, I'm going to get out to run an errand and you're going to wait for me there, without moving. Don't even think about moving. We have to go somewhere else after. May I ask where to after, Grandpa? Sorry, I meant sir. You may not. No schleppers allowed! Come on, let me in. - No! - Come on, goyshe kopP- Tarnapolsky's daughter's expecting me. Tama's daughter went to Israel 15 years ago. Now it's the granddaughter. But I don't think she'll see you at this hour. She's a theater actress. It's urgent, Isaac. Good evening, Mr. Bursztein. It's late, I'm busy right now. You have your grandfather's eyes. Thanks. I'm in the middle of a rehearsal. - If you'll excuse me... - Do you recognize this? Yes. He gave it to me, one week before passing. What do you need? I want to go here. - Poland? - Yes. Come back in the morning and I can help you better. It has to be now. Now? Please. You're a sweetheart. The first flight to Poland is Thursday. No, today. Are you on the run? Don't ask such things. Find me the first flight leaving for Europe. There's a flight tonight to Madrid. It's a little tight. Can you go straight to the airport? Yes. Okay. But what will I do in Madrid? Everything's nearby in Europe. You can take a train. Okay. When do you want to come back? Never. Okay, then. From Madrid to Warsaw by train, but in Pan's you have to take a taxi to change stations. - Should I buy it? - Yes. A one-way ticket plus the train costs 3,230 dollars. How much with the discount? Your grandfather always sold me tickets and I made all his suits. There's no discount and there's no time. - Do you want it or not? - Yes. What the hell are you going to do in Poland? If I find out you told anyone I was here, - |'|| cut off your veitzm. - No, not that. Good evening. May I ask what you're reading? I asked you what you're reading. Amagazine. Yes, of course. I can see that it's a magazine. Any particular subject? Music. Any type of music? No. Jazz, rock... Are you a musician? I'm reading, sir. Yes, but you look like a musician, that's why I was asking. Are you a musician? Yes. More or less. More than less or less than more? - Right, you want to read. - Yes. Please. Do you play an instrument? Piano. Or drums. - Piano. - Piano, I knew it. Abraham Bursztein. Nice to meet you. Your grace? Leo. Not your sign, your name. - Leonardo. - Oh, Leonardo. How funny. The piano. All the greats always wrote for piano. Rimsky-Korsakov, Verdi, Salgén... - |'m going to get a little rest. - Why? Why What? Are you tired? You're from Buenos Aires? Are you taking a vacation or are you playing somewhere? Because musicians travel a lot. We have an issue with you, Mr. Bursztein. You have no return ticket, you're broke and you won't give a reason for your trip. No, look. I told the other gentleman I'm here to deliver something. And I do have money. I didn't trust his face, that's why I said I didn't. Look, sir. We're your gateway to Europe fight now. How much do you want? Are you trying to bribe me, Mr. Bursztein? Come on, kid. I have things to do. How long do you plan to stay in Europe? How long should I say? Look, if you don't collaborate, it's straight back to Buenos Aires... The first thing I asked you is how much you want and you say I'm not collaborating! Okay. Back to your country then. They'll bury me alive. Mo'? My daughters. They sold my house, they want to cutoff my leg and lock me up in a retirement home. So you ran away to Europe. Yes. This is where I'm going. POLAND Why show me? Why not say "|'m going to Poland." Because I don't say bad words. You were born in Poland, right? What will you do there? Deliver this. To who? To a person. - And he's expecting it. - Yes. When was the last time you were in Poland? 1945. And you told him you're coming? He's expecting you? - I promised him. - V\/hen? When we said goodbye. - In 1945. - Yes. - But you stayed in touch. - No. What makes you think you'll find him if you haven't stayed in touch after 70 years? He's expecting me. I'm sorry, but this all sounds a little weird. Weird? Do you know the history? Do you know what happened to the Jews in Europe? Something. If you know "something," why does it sound weird? If you want to kill me, send me back. They won't let me in. I lived here illegally for a long time. I have no return ticket, no money to show them. I have a 4-year-old daughter waiting at home. Round trip, you bozo. - Reynoso. - Here. I'm a little tired. It's my age. When a man my age says "Good evening," you put down your shitty magazine and answer. It's not a shitty magazine. It's the best alternative music magazine in the world. I'm talking about something else. All right. They're called manners. I apologize. Apology accepted. You know what? You can have it. Abraham, sir. Here's my number. If you want, I can come get you tonight and take you to the station. It would be my pleasure. Besides, I owe you my life. You don't owe me anything. WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR MONEY PROBLEMS THE LENDER WENT OUT TO GET PAID BACK WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR BELONGINGS Good morning, Miss. Do I look like a Miss to you at my age? When in doubt, always go with "Miss." How can I help you? I work for a travel agency and I'm organizing a package for Argentinean retirees - who want to come to Madrid. - How many? Thirty. - How long will they stay? - Aweek. I can offer double rooms for 30. - 15 per person? - Yes. Okay. I'm going to stay until tonight. I have to catch a train - at 9:30. - 50. You said 15. For 30 people for one week. But I'm organizing the package, my lady. I'm not your lady or anybody else's. Glad to hear it. Glad to hear what'? That you're nobody's lady. Mister... - Bursztein, Abraham Bursztein. - Mister, I don't have time for gallantArgentineans, I'd almost say they're not allowed in my house. If you want a double room for one night, that's 50 euros. - Miss... - Gonzalez. First name? No first name. Okay, Gonzalez. Do you want the room or not? A little boy was walking through a forest. When he reached an open field, he saw what looked like a dead star lying in the grass. He ran to his village and told a {We girl what he had saw, but she didn't believe him and made fun of him. The boy swore that he wasn't lying and convinced her to follow him. So they ran back to the field and reached the star. But they were afraid to touch it because it had scary, sharp tips. Then the star surprised them because it turned on. "I'm not dead," said the bright star. “What happened, “ asked the boy. "I fell asleep, forgot to float and fell out of the sky." That's why we know that stars never sleep, because if they fall asleep, they forget to float, and if they forget to float, they fall out of the sky. Mr. Burszteini! Mr. Bursztein, for God's sake, open the door! Abraham? Abraham? Abraham. What happened? What time was your train? At 9130. You missed it. It's 10110. I'm hungry. Then I'll take you somewhere. - Is it a date? - No. A little more... and we might get along later on. A time more, I bring the scent of new affection. Let's take the road to love again, no matter what you might have to forget. If we're going to make a painful mistake, it's better to beg. A little more... will offer relief for two failures. And if you leave, a! Seas! take my tired arms with you. Why are you so angry with men? I had three husbands. The first walked out on me and my two kids. Oh, you separated! He separated, without a word. I looked for him for 7 years. And the 7th year he showed up. The second showed up. And the first never came back? Yes, that's why I left the second. And you know what the jerk did to me? Jvfimich one do you mean'? - The first. No, I don't. What did he do to you? He left. - He left again? - Yes. And I realized I'd made a mistake with the second, an exceptional man, with plenty of balls, and I begged him to forgive me, on my knees. And he told you to go to hell. No, he forgave me. One always returns to the old places where they loved life... A generous man, huh'? Understanding. A son of a bitch. Easy, Casanova. You came with me. Hey, I was greeting the lady. I can't be rude. You'd better be. You're jealous because that lady said hello to me? No, go ahead, follow your balls. They probably reach the floor, by the way. They reach as far as your tits. No, I had my tits operated on. My balls too! You old degenerate! What... What are you going to do in Poland? Deliver a suit. You already said that, but tell me about it. No, finish your story, it's much more interesting. Which one? The second husband who forgave you. Tell me why, after taking you back, after you left him for your first husband, you call him a... Son of a bitch. Yes, that's what you said. Because he forgave me, but it came at a high price. Oh, right. Did you leave the window of your room open? What window? Answer me. Your window, did you leave it open? I didn't open anything. God! 15,900 dollars. And you tried to haggle the price of the room. 50 euros a night and this place cleans you out. What do I do now? The sign in reception is big and written in capital letters. Please, leave me alone. I'm very sorry. Not as sorry as I am. What are you going to do? I have a daughter who lives here in Madrid. But I can't ask her for anything. Why? Because we had a fight. Then it's time to go see your daughter and patch things up because you can't even pay for your breakfast. No, she's the one who has to apologize. Why does she have to apologize? Because she humiliated me in front of everyone. She only had to say three words, three nice little words. - And that's why you got angry. - Yes. Because she wouldn't say a few words. Yes... Oh, my God. This. A friend gave it to me one week before he died. How much can I get for this? You have to talk to your daughter. And tell her what's happening to you. No. Then find somewhere else to stay. Was it her? Eh? Let's go. Why didn't you do anything? I won't be able to. My daughters, I've had a hard life, I'm very tired. I've decided to put my house in your name and my life savings. The only thing I ask in return, is that each one of you, in a few words, tell me how much you love me. And when it was her turn, she said that she was ashamed of all the falsehood she had heard in her sisters' ridiculous speeches, that you show love through acts, not words and that she refuses to participate in such an absurd ceremony. Then I said: "Immediately leave my house and family forever." And she left. You're crazy. She disrespected me in front of everyone. She was the only honest one. How did it end up with the others? The others sold my house and wanted to put me in a retirement home. You see? You deserve it. Help me sell this, please. That's priceless. A friend gave it to you. You're a great person, you know. You aren't. Yes 7. Claudia? Yes, who is it? Me. Are you there? Dad? Yes. Stay where you are. H! be right down. She told me to go to hell. Stan the car, let's go. Go on, start the car. I heard it all, Abraham. What's happening, Dad? I've come to apologize. I made a mistake, I was wrong. Who is it'? Agentleman. Hi, gorgeous. Hi. What's going on? I'm going here. Dad, wasn't Poland a bad word? I'm going to see someone. Jvfimo? - A friend. - In Poland, Dad? - Yes. Why are you here? I'm here to apologize because I was wrong. And to meet her. I'm going to write Sara. They're desperate. Don't even mention Sara. They sold my house and kept everything, even your share. I gave it to them by mistake and now they're worried, poor babies, they're desperate. - They didn't keep my share. - Yes, they did, I gave it to them. And they gave it to me. Damn wretches! Look, Dad... Didn't you just say it was a mistake? You only had to say three words. Why are you here? They opened the window and broke into the room. - What? - I lost everything. Who? Shoshana, Sara? I don't even have money to eat. I don't understand you, Dad. Is he my grandfather? I have to get to Lodz. What are you talking about? I gave my word. And all my money got stolen. Let's go upstairs. Come on, they're desperate. I can do with two thousand. Money? Well, a thousand. I'll get you a thousand. Come on, sweetie. Come on, let's go. This isn't your home anymore. - For God's sake, !et him in! - Silence! Shut the door right now. - I'm letting him in. - I said shut the door. I'm letting... him... in. Piourek, Piotrek! They'll come back and want their house back. You owe everything you have to his father. You're... you're a bad person. Can you hear me? You're home. Ladies and gentlemen, we?! be arriving shortly at Paris Montparnasse. Ladies and gentlemen, the Gare de YEst invites you to visit the Train Museum. Good day, Monsieur. How are you, sir? Do you speak Spanish? I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. Give me some paper. Excuse me? NO ALEMANIA - POLAND Yes, but... No, no. Your destination is Warsaw. I'm sorry sir, but I don't understand you. Sabine. ! don't understand what he wants. Good day, sir. Can we help you? I want to go to this country without passing through this other one. Not even a meter. Not even a centimeter, not a tiny piece of this one. Do you understand? Can I help you? Who could possibly think of a Jew crossing all of this by train like it's nothing and change trains... in this city? I think he wants to go to Poland without crossing Germany. Then he can take a plane. It's not possible, sir. Sir. Sir, your ticket! Excuse me. Excuse me, do you speak Yiddish? Yes, I do. Good morning, my name is Ingrid. Abraham Bursztein. They made fun of me. No, they didn't understand. »Yes, they did. - I don't think so. You, as a Jew... I'm not Jewish. I'm German. I studied Jewish history in college, that's why! can speak Yiddish. If you're not Jewish, don't speak Yiddish. I speak Spanish too. I'm trying to help you. You're not well. Sorry if I bothered you. And Sheine? What happened to her? You changed your mind. I'm glad. I'm an anthropologist. You know what anthropology is? Just tell me what you want and let's get this over with. What are you going to do in Poland? I'm going to see a friend who saved my life when you people left. Us? You people, yes. We're in Germany now. I'm divorced. My kids have grown up. I travel a lot. Things changed in Germany. We Germans, even those of us who hadn't been born yet have understood something. We're all responsible for what we did. I think countries and people can also go crazy, commit atrocities... Please go away. Personally, I feel ashamed. They ripped her from my arms. Mo'? I understand. I won't bother you again. Kid... If you want to do something for me, find me a way to not have to set foot in your country. That's okay, I'll do it. I'm doing it! Excuse the inconvenience. We're under reconstruction. My mother was a teacher. My father, a tailor. I had a brother and a little sister who made up stones. She hypnotized us since she was little with her stories. Beautiful. Unique. In summer we went to the river. My uncles and aunts came, my cousins... During happy times, at the parties, we were more than 60. We were happy, but we didn't know. You know what my fathefis crime was besides being Jewish? Having an accordion. You know what my uncle's crime was? My mother's brother? Having a violin. A bullet in my uncle's head, a bullet in my father's head. I wasn't told about it. I saw it. From my window. Excuse the inconvenience. We're under reconstruction. You know what my little sister's crime was, the one who made up stories? Not having been born one month sooner. Ten thousand children. From babies to ten years old. Twenty wagons packed to the roof with screams and tears. You had to be 11 years old to be saved. She was only one month short. I wasn't told about it. I saw it. She looked me in the eye... before she got on. We inform passengers that the express train to Warsaw will be arriving on platform 4. What's wrong? And what will you do now? Hey, you. Where are you going? Come here, kid. I said come here! Tell me your name. You're scared, aren't you? Show me the garbage between your legs. Show me! Can you hear me, Mr. Bursztein? My name is Gosia and I'm your nurse. Can you hear me? Can you tell me your name? Where are we? In Warsaw. Warsaw. Tell me your full name, please. Abraham Samuel Bursztein. Date Of birth? January 15th, 1927. Nationality? Argentinean. Place of birth? Lodz. - Then you're Polish? - No. - Can you speak Polish? - No. Tell me your fathefis full name. Josseff... Jaim Bursztein. Your mother's? Sun Rfika... Klainberg. Do you know you came back from the dead? Yes. You're a lucky man. Depends on how you look at my life. Your leg was in very bad shape. The doctors decided to amputate it. Doctor Janowski found out and wanted to see it. The surgeons had an argument. I heard Janowski shout that if your leg had any chance at all, they had to save it. Can Tzures walk? Tzu res? Tzures is my fight leg's name. Your rehabilitation will take sometime. Miss Gosia. When they let me out of the hospital, would you be kind enough to take me to a friend's house? Yes, of course. Where is it? Lodz. Lodz? Lodz. Okay, tel! me more about your friend. He's Nadia's son, she worked for us. And Olek, my fathefs employee at the tailor shop. He was his right hand. Piotrek was born the same winter as me. He was a very shy kid. We called him the Mute. He only talked to me. And when he spoke, he had a beautiful, gentle voice. It was like a caress. So you and Piotrek grew up together. We were like brothers. Until we had to go to the ghetto in '39. After the ghetto, I was in two labor camps. When the occupation ended, before leaving, the Nazis were going lo kill us all. They marched us to an extermination camp, but I escaped. I got lost in the forest and climbed a tree. I ate birds, roots... I drank rainwater. When I couldn't take it anymore, I left the forest and found out the Germans had left because the Russians had arrived. They didn't kill Jews. I don't know how 1 managed to survive and reach my house in Lodz. Piotrek took care of me. He put me in the same service room where he had grown up. And when 1 recovered and got my strength back, Piotrek gave me clothes and his father's savings, which he had stolen himself. There was a letter in the house from an aunt who had gone to Argentina before the war. And Piotrek gave it to me, with the clothes and money. I promised to write him, to come back one day to see him to tel! him how my fife had turned out. I don'! know why, but I didn't keep my promise. You're keeping it now. No, this isn't it. That wasn't there. It must be somewhere else. Have you got the address? Piotrkowska 122. It's there. We turn left into the alley. It's less than 100 meters. I'm scared. Of what? That he's not there. That he is. Of everything. We should go back. What are you talking about? What if he left? If... It's very likely that either he left or he died. But it won't do you any good to leave without finding out. - What do you think? - Me? I think there's only one God. We call him different things, but he's the same for everyone. And whatever happens, it's his will. I was referring to Piotrek, not God. VWI he be there or not? It's not as different as you think. I'm only going to say one thing to you. You're a great man, that's why you've come this far. I suppose we have to knock. I suppose. What do we do if he's not here? He will be. We'll ask here if anyone knows him. Don't be sad, sir. After so many years... I should have come sooner. You did what you could. Piotrek is gone. What do you want to do? Go with him. What about there? This... is my last suit. I used a pattern you gave me in '45. A blue one? Yes. Let's go home.
