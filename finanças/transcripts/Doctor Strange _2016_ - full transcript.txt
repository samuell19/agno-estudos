Steven Strange... ...might I offer you some advice? Forget everything that you think you know. You're a man looking at the world through a keyhole. You've spend your life trying to widen it. You work saved the lives of thousands. What if I told you... ...that reality is one of many, I don't believe in fairy tales about shockerers or energy or the power of the belief. You wonder what I see in your future? Possibility. Why are you doing this? There are other ways to save lives. So much you don't know. Teach me.
