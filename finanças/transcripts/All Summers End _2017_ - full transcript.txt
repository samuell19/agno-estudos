Subtitles by explosiveskull Alright, you ready? Yeah. Alright, stand back. Can I try? Go ahead. Get the flame right on the wick. Careful. OK, stand back. Hey. How's it going? It's going. Just out taking a walk. Is it cool if I join you? Yeah. I was young... once. Be back by eight, yeah? Come on, Dad. Let's go. When we're young, we think we're invincible. But then life teaches you otherwise. I was 16-years-old the summer I met Grace Turner. Hey. What are you doing? I'm throwing this bridge in the river. Here. Go ahead. Toss it over. OK. Doesn't this upset the fish? No. They just move and then forget why they even moved in the first place. Whoa. I'd hate to live like that. Like what? Like, not remembering things. Think about everything you'd lose. All the great memories you wouldn't have. Well, I guess I better get going. OK. What would you say if I told you you were gonna be my first love? What would you say to that? Um... I don't know what I'd say. OK. Think about it, and get back to me when you do. I had no idea what I was doing. Our town was trying to kill us with boredom. So Hunter insisted this July 4th would be the greatest act of rebellion since 1776. Timmy was more concerned with the practical matters of manhood. The three of us were in a race to see who could get to third base first. So..., what are you... what are you doin' tonight? None of us wanted to lose. You know, she totally wants you, man. I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? She told you for Christ's sake. I guess. Give me that. No guessing, man, alright? She wants it bad. Dude, if I was you, I'd be getting on that shit. - Mmm. - I mean, you gotta make sure she knows that you're the one calling the shots, you know. I mean, otherwise we might as well just forget the whole thing. She probably just wants you for your body anyway. Yeah, probably. - Shut up, Tim. - Ohh! Come on, guys, let's get outta here. You guys want any more of this? - I'm good. - Nope. Naw? Alright, I'm gonna chuck it. - Do it. - Chuck it. - Uh-oh. - Uh-oh. - Here we go! - Chuck, chuck, chuck! Kaboom! And the crowd goes wild! Conrad? My father left us five years before, and home hadn't been the same since. To fill the void, my mom had latched on to me so tight I could barely breathe. So, today, things were gonna be different, I had an invitation I couldn't refuse. One way or another I was gonna make my move. Well, look who it is. Come on. We're all out back. How 'bout another burger, Conrad? Uh, I'm OK. C'mon, you need to put some more meat on those bones of yours. OK, you talked me into it. There you go. Eric, could you get me a beer? Sure thing, Dad. It's nice of you to join us, Connie. Your family didn't have any plans? Uh, well, my mom, she's outta town, she's, uh, out on business right now. Oh, a working woman, huh? See, honey, I told you they existed. That must be so hard. Dad, tell her to stop. How 'bout your father, what does he do? Oh. Problem there, Connie? Eric, just shut it. See? Always with the attitude. Be careful, man, you're gonna have a hard time keeping her in line. Dad, tell him to stop. - Gracie, relax. - He's trying to embarrass me. You do that on your own. Stop being such a shithead, Eric. Watch the language. Oh, my God! Eric, I think you know better. C'mon, I was just jokin' with her. Right. Hey, Connie! Uh, listen, man, you like my sister, don't ya? Yeah, well, I mean... It's cool, man, don't sweat it. OK. Play it cool, OK, don't show her you're too interested. But, don't hold back too much either. Yeah, I guess. Gotta make the first move, man. - Be aggressive. - Cool. But not too aggressive, alright, she's still my little sister. Yeah. - Good luck, buddy. - You too, man. Hey. I'm really sorry about my family. They're so annoying. They seem pretty great to me. Well, looks can be deceiving right? Hm. So, you coming to the fireworks with us tonight, or what? Uh, well, I kinda told the guys I'd hang out with them tonight. Oh. Let's hope I survive it alone then. The winds blowing nice today. Yeah. Hey, hey, hey. You two hooking up or what? - Hey, guys. - Hi, Grace. Hey, Timmy. Hey, Hunter. You, uh, teachin' our boy the ways of the world? - Dude, shut up. - Aw, look at that, defending his girl, how sweet. I'm sorry, Grace. Hey, hey, hey, did you just say sorry to her, man? Cause, you were supposed to meet up with us like three hours ago. It's cool, Conrad, if you wanna hang out with a buncha children go right ahead. - Ohh! Burn! - Oh, God! How am I gonna recover from that one? - It hurts! - Hunter, how am I gonna recover from that? See you later? OK. Gentlemen. - Mmm. How ladylike. - Ohh, yes. Bye. - Bye, Grace. - Have a wonderful day. You got yourself a keeper there, Conrad. Dude, what the hell are you doing? Hey, calm down, man. Why'd you have to do that? You're embarrassing me... What are you talking about? Dude, I don't even know where his hands have been. Where they been, Connie? Obviously not on Grace. Ohh. You hear that, Con? Obviously not on Grace. That hurt. That hurt. So, you'd, uh, get a little kiss? No, you totally blew the moment, dude. - I was going to. - Blew the moment? - Yeah. - Aw, did you hear this, kid? Yeah, I'm hearing it. Stop with the angry game, Con, alright? You ditched us for her. I was just leaving to come find you guys, I swear. Ohh, OK, well, looked like you were just trying to find something, if you ask me. Oh, man, finding something for sure. Should we even include him in tonight's plans, Tim? See, uh, I don't know. I just don't know. - I don't know either, man. - Just tell me what's goin' on. Alright, we got wheels. My Granddad's taking the night off, so we'll snag his truck. He won't even know. You can't drive. Dude, I got my permit alright, don't be a pussy. Why can't we just head over to the fireworks like everybody else? Lame. Lame! Oh, we're doing it with or without you, Con. I mean, you wanna ditch us again, go for it. - C'mon, man. - Oh, no, no, no, no, it's cool, man. Have fun, buddy. See you later. Peace. Alright, Tim, open the trunk and take the wheel, alright? Go, go! Open it man, open it. Let's go, let's go. Look what I got. Let's go, c'mon. - Oh, shit let's go. - Hunter, let's go. C'mon, c'mon. Go, go, go, go, go. Damn, dude. You need to stop pulling that shit. Jesus, you were loving it like five seconds ago. Yeah, what's your deal, man? I mean, ever since you started getting pussy, you've turned into a pussy. Man's got a point. You're just jealous 'cause I'm actually getting some. Ah, if you're such a man, then why don't you prove it? I'm not proving shit to you. Oh, wow, what do you think, Tim? Think he'd prove something to shitface Grace if she asked him to? I bet he would. Yeah, I think so, too. No real man chooses some chick over his best buds. Hey, Tim, make a left right here. Fourth house on the right. Dude, you don't have the balls. What the hell? Hey! Eat a dick, bitch! Did you see the look on his face? What the hell, Hunter, he saw me! Jeez, man, whatever, OK, it's dark. He doesn't have a clue. Besides it's a stupid plant, alright, who cares? Oh, shit! Shit. Alright, chill out, you guys. Make a right up ahead, we're gonna lose him on the outskirts. Connie, you need to throw that goddamn plant out the window. No. Hunter, what are you doing? - Hey, don't, hey! - That's the point, man. - What the hell is wrong with you? - Calm down. I can't get rid of him! Got it. Hey, look out! Is he OK? - He's dead, isn't he? - Shut up, Tim. Oh, my God. He's still breathing. - Let's get the hell outta here. - What? It's a public road, Conrad. Someone's gonna drive by any second, and when they do, they'll get help. And we need to get the hell outta here. I'm not gonna leave him there to die out there... we're not gonna leave him. He's not gonna die, godammit. Look, he's breathing, Conrad, OK? Alright, we take a vote, OK? Hunter, we're not gonna leave him here! I say we leave. We're not gonna leave him. What's it gonna be, Timmy? God. You need to vote, Tim. Look, I need you to trust me here, Conrad, alright? Everything is gonna be fine. C'mon. Swear to God, I'll leave you. Hey, I'll take care of the ornaments, alright? Conrad? So you did come home last night? Yeah, I... I got tied up with Hunter and Timmy. Tied up? You ran off when we had a whole day planned. Mom. I'm sorry. I didn't... Didn't what? Come eat breakfast. What's that? What's what? On your shirt? Is that blood? Go on, get it. Hello? Ms. Williams. Morning, Rachel. This is an early surprise. Oh, my God. I appreciate you telling me first. This is terrible, they must be a mess. Call me if you hear anything more, will you? Bye-bye to you too. Hey. He's dead. Did you hear me, Hunter? I said he's dead. Whole town's talking about it. Well, what're we gonna do? What'd you mean? He hit a deer. Alright, nobody needs to know any more than that. Hunter, we shoulda done something. And just what do you want, Con? We can't just bring him back to life by saying a few words. What happened, happened, Connie, and there ain't no changing that. Would you stop with the damn ball? You know we can go on and on about what we shoulda done, but in the end we still didn't, alright, we walked. - And that was our decision. - That was your decision, Hunter! That was your decision. Oh, yeah, was real nice of you to help him out. I said stop with the damn ball. Guys, guys, guys! No, stop, stop! I was furious, at Hunter, at the pain, at myself. But I had it coming. Consequences, they don't always hit you right away, but when they do, you feel them. Oh, my God! Wh... What happened to you? I'm OK. Grace... I just heard. I'm fine. I just... I'm going for a walk. I, um, I'm stopped now, but I was going for a walk. Stop, I'm OK. I'm fine. Jesus, you're covered in blood. Did Hunter or Timmy give you that? Hunter. God, why do you hang out with those dicks? - Grace, I'm really sorry... - Conrad, I said it's fine. I mean, Jesus Christ, just shut the hell up for like five seconds? Yeah. Thanks. No problem. C'mon. Let's get you cleaned up. Here, give me that. Come here. Where are you parents? Uh, I don't know. Upstairs probably. I'm sorry about yesterday. About what? I was just... I was angry, and I wanted it to feel right when it happened. I mean, I've kissed other boys before, but with you, I don't know. I wanted it to be, like, important, you know? Um... you lost a lotta blood. Want some juice or something? Uh, sure. - Apple or orange? - Orange. Correct. That's a point. A point? Yeah, I'm keeping score for you. You're at three now. - What if I wanted apple? - Well, we don't even have apple, so you definitely would have lost a point. What are my other two points for? Well, one is for my parents, I think they like you. And the other one? Never mind that one. Grace, can I... can I tell you something? Just say it. Just give me a sec. Oh, Grace, I'm sorry. Hey, listen. We heard about what happened, and wanted to do something. This is not much, but... It's... It's, um, tuna noodle casserole, the recipe your mom loves. - How's she doing? - She's good. - Oh, hi. - Hi, uh, Conrad. - Nice to meet you. - Uh, her friend. We live across the street. Are you OK? Yeah, oh, yeah, I had a bloody nose earlier. I think Mr. and Mrs. Turner are upstairs. I could tell 'em you stopped by? - That'd be great, yeah. - I'm here, Conrad. Thank you. Um... this helps. - How's Lynn doing? - Ah, it's gonna take some time. Conrad, maybe you should go home and get cleaned up, OK. Oh, yeah. Sorry. You need anything, I mean, anything, don't hesitate. I mean it. Bye. Bye. - Nice meeting you. - You too. It is in the times when confronted with death, that we are reminded how truly precious life is. This is never more present than when a life is taken away at such a young age. It is not always evident in the moment as to the ways of our world, and it causes us to question, for it is through this imperfect world of ours that we all must travel, and as Eric has done as he leaves this earth... I wasn't invited. But I forced myself to bear witness to what I had done. Hey, a little help over here? Thanks. Yeah, I figured it was you up here. Man, he really did a number on you the other day, huh? Uh, yeah, for what it's worth, I think he's sorry. Thanks for the apology, huh. Thanks. C'mon man. You know how he is. Man, I don't even care about that. What are you up here for? What do you want? I've been thinking about Eric's family. Better get used to it. 'Cause now we have to for the rest of our lives. What if we said something, you know? What if we... what if we did something to fix it? Timmy, he's dead. Can't fix that. Hello? Hey. Oh, hey. - Can you come over? - What's going on? I need to talk to you. Yeah. It's easy to think that life will fix your problems for you, somehow everything will turn out alright. Psst. Hey. Climb up. That's the thing about fear, it can convince you of anything. C'mon. We gotta be quiet. Just watch where you step. I know it's a mess. OK... when you left the picnic that day, you said you couldn't stop by the fireworks. Yeah, well, I told the guys... Will you just shut up and let me talk? I don't care that you didn't, I just need to get this out, alright? Alright. After the picnic, Eric and I got in a fight. I don't even know what it was about, but... I told him that I didn't want him to come to the fireworks. He didn't come because of me, Conrad. If I hadn't... he wouldn't... It's not your fault, Grace. It's not your fault. Sorry.... Um... Wha... Come here. - Sleep with me? - What? Don't be stupid, just sleep next to me. Just for a little while. What about your parents? It's just that... I haven't been able to sleep for days, and... I think it would help. OK. Gracie? Yeah, Mom, just getting the paper. - Bye. - Bye. Suddenly, it struck me... one day... Grace will be older than her older brother, she would grow up, follow her dreams... but he would always be 19. Hey. What're you doing? Eric was gonna... Gracie's out riding her bike. She's gonna be awhile. You need any help with this? No. Naw, I'm good. You sure? I got it. I'd be happy to do whatever. Alright. Knock yourself out. Um... take out the one-bys and then, uh, take it down with the frame. - Got it. - Alright. There you go. Grief has a way of uncovering the things we'd rather hide. Hi, Connie. Come on inside, I made some lemonade to take the heat off. Sometimes it pulls us together, sometimes it pulls us apart. How's Gracie, Conrad? - Um, she seems alright. - That's good. That's good. He was just like you, you know. Not now, I mean, but when he was your age. Her brother was much different with her when she was young. Don't forget that part of you, OK? - What's going on? - Hey, Grace. Your mom was just giving me a glass of lemonade. There's some more in the fridge. What's your Mom like? Total freak. Without my Dad, it's like she thinks I'm his replacement or something. I mean, all I wanna do is just be a kid, you know. God, I just don't get them sometimes. It's weird, right? Like, but when we were younger, they were sorta like gods. All knowing or all powerful. And had all the answers in the world. Yeah, totally. But then, like, you wake up one day, and you realize that your parents are just as crazy and messed up as we are. Whoa, what is this place? C'mon, I'll show you. Whoa, cool. So, is this like where you and the guys hang out? No, they don't even know about this place. - Well, why not? - I don't know. I just don't think they'd get it if I brought them here, you know? I like you. I feel different around you than I do with the guys. Oh... I would hope so! Shut up. That's not what I mean. I mean, I can be myself more. You know, say what's on my mind. Instead of all that stupid stuff. I like how you worry about me, and that look you give me. I don't really know what it is, but I like it. So, do you think someone used to live here, or what? Yeah, I guess. Something must have happened though. - It's totally a mess now. - Yeah. I mean, it's not as bad as your room. Shut up. - Pick something out. - Huh? Anything. Anything you want, pick it out. OK. Um... here. What about this? - That? - Yeah. Are you sure? OK, c'mon. What are we doing? Hurry, quick, before it burns out. OK. I know it's dumb, but this stuff has so much history. These things people used to love, they're just objects, but they've been through so much, you know? Sometimes people forget that history's all still there. But it's weird like, you burn it, and it's gone. You were the last person in its life. ...and suddenly nothing's left. Where's that all go? - Hello. - Can I help you? I'm Katherine Stevens, um, Conrad's Mom. Uh, come in. Um, I was so devastated when I heard about your loss. I hope he hasn't been too much of a fuss? Connie? No, no, he's a real good kid. He's a pleasure to have around here anytime. Is he here by any chance? You're beautiful. Guys aren't beautiful, they're handsome. Beautiful, too. So are you. Wanna see something? There's more? Whoa. What happened? When I was eight, Eric and I got into a fight about something, and he pushed me into a pole down in our basement, and a screw on it dug into my back. Ah, jeez. That had to hurt, huh? No... it didn't, actually. That's the funny part, I didn't even know it happened until he told me that I was covered in blood. It was 13 stitches. Scar'll probably be there forever. It's ugly though, huh? No. No, I like it. Guess we better get going, huh? Yeah. Oh. Um, hi. I'm Kathy Stevens. Conrad's mom. Ah, my hands are filthy. Sorry 'bout that. Uh, I see you're building something outside. Uh, yeah, it's a new gazebo. So, Conrad told me that you were away on business. Excuse me? What are you doing...? Would you stop? I can't believe you went over there! I was doing something nice. Don't you think I wanna see where my son's disappeared for the last two weeks? Don't you think I worry?! Yeah, Mom, I'm sure you get real upset. I don't like your tone. Eh, I don't... I don't know what's goin' on with you! - Hunter and Timmy said... - Hunter and Timmy are assholes, Mom! - What are you two up to? - Just hangin' out. You said it yourself, I should watch out for her. I didn't tell you to spend every waking moment with her. I got news for you, kiddo. As long as you live under my roof, you owe me answers. - Fine. - Where you goin'? - Just get outta the way, Mom. - Where you think you're goin'? - Don't you... no... - Move, just move. Just move! Wow, you guys built this in grade school? Yeah. My Dad helped us build it. We barely ever come here anymore, though. You shouldn't even be in here, actually. Seriously? No girls policy. Yeah, well, it's kinda like our place, ya know? I thought you didn't hang out with them anymore? Yeah, I guess. That was a while ago. Awww. Aren't you guys cool. So now what? Hey, go slow. Hold on, hold on. Sorry. OK, it's OK. Just go slow. Holy shit. Wha... What's up, man? Oh, what's up, man? You tell me, playboy? Nothing, we were just hangin' out. OK, these two were just hangin' out, Timmy. - Oh, that's cool. - Oh, wait. Oh, wait, I'm sorry, did I say, "hanging out," 'cause what I meant to say was Conrad's over here finger-blasting the hell outta Grace. - Dude, Hunter, shut up. - You shut up! Let's just get outta here, dude, they're fine. - How's this not piss you off? - Are you two gonna leave? 'Cause we were just getting started, and I'd really like to get back to it. C'mon. C'mon, let's go. Jesus. What the hell, man? Grow up, Hunter. I'm seriously sorry about that. Stop apologizing for them. I bet neither of them even kissed a girl before. What are they doing? Um, they're heading up north for the night. For what? To pack up Eric's dorm room. You're not going? No. - Don't you think you should? - God, stop. - What? - You sound just like them. I'd just get in the way and be miserable the whole time. Besides, if I don't go, then we'd have the place to ourselves. You don't think your parents have thought of that? Yeah, they gave me this whole lecture on trust and stuff. But I'm not a child. Sleep with me tonight, Conrad. It's just that, I just... wanted things to be about us right now. Ya know? I want to. I just... I just... What? What? - I don't know. - What, what? Well, I guess you think about it, and then you can come back later tonight... Whatever happens, happens. But... if you do want to, then we need to be ready. Know what I mean? Yeah, think so. Alright. See you later tonight? Alright. There you go. Can I help you with something? No. I'm good. Sorry. Is that all? Yeah. And some condoms, too. - What's that? - Um, some condoms, please. What kind? I don't care. It doesn't matter. Eighteen seventy-nine. Oh. Watch where you're goin', dude. You watch it. - Hey, hold up, man. - Just stay away from me. Look... I'm sorry. Alright. No, no, no, seriously, I am, OK? It's just not the same without you around. I mean, we're all supposed to be in this together, right? And now Tim doesn't even wanna talk to me anymore. Oh, so now because you lost your two best friends you feel bad that we let some kid die? Hey, can we just talk for a minute? I didn't think you'd ever get here. Hi. Wow, you look beautiful. Thanks. Have you ever played "what if", Conrad? What do you mean? What if our lives never crossed? Like, what if we never met? You wouldn't be in my life. And everything would be different. This whole summer would be different. Yeah, it would be. You make me really happy. You OK? You OK? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Was last night OK? Yeah. It was perfect, right? Yeah, totally. You sure you're alright? I'm great. What are you doing? Goin' to church. Mr. and Mrs. Morris will be here to pick me up any minute. - Are you gonna be gone long? - No, just a couple hours. You can make yourself at home though. My parents won't be back until the night. Grace, we're home. She's in the shower. Where is she? She went to church. You're not supposed to be home... We welcomed you into our home, and this is what you do? Mr. Turner... Leave. Hi, Grace. Hey. - Do you, do you have a second? - Can you just leave me alone? - It's important, OK. - What do you want? I want to say, um... I'm sorry. Sorry for, uh, for everything. I just, uh, needed to say that. Jesus, you're a spaz. What if lies don't cover up the past? Maybe they cover up the present. Turn us inside out, and force themselves to the surface. I'm not gonna to stop seeing him, Dad. Frankly, Grace, after what you've done, you have no choice in the matter. Grace. - Don't you turn your back. - No! - We trusted you! - Let go of me. You promised you wouldn't betray that trust! And yet you go right ahead and walk all over it, right when your mother and I needed you most! You both just can't stand the fact that I found something good. That something actually makes me happy. - Gracie, please. Stop. - Grace. Honey, you need to be honest with yourself, and do what's right for this family. You gotta be kidding me. Grace, It's already been decided. Decided by who? The two of you? You've barely even talked to each other since Eric died. You... you've barely even looked at me since he died. He has nothing to do with this. He has everything to do with it, Mom! Grace! Grace! Conrad? Conrad? Oh, my God! Conrad! Thank God. I've been looking everywhere for you. You... You OK? - Your parent's came home. - I know, but listen, I don't care about what they said, or what they want, or about them at all. You're the only one that I care about anymore. Just... just run away with me. - What? - I'm serious. Let's just go. Our parents are crazy. We're better off alone without them, together. - Say you'll think about it. - Grace, listen. Grace, listen. You've already runaway. We could live here for a while, - and plan something out. - Grace, stop! What is it? Conrad, talk to me. I let your brother die. Wh.. What? - I'm sorry. - Wh.. what are you talking about? The night of the accident I was out with Hunter and Timmy, and it was just supposed to be this prank, and nobody was supposed to be home, but he was. - Slow down. - He chased us and he hit that deer. You're not making any sense. What are you talking about? He hit the tree, and we didn't, we didn't stay, I wish we had. No, no, he was alone. He wasn't, Grace. This isn't... this isn't funny. This isn't a fun joke, don't... tell me you're joking. It's true. Oh, my God, it's true, - I can see it in your face. - Grace, please. - You watched him die. - I didn't watch him die, Grace. - I wanted to stay, I wanted to help him. - You said you were there. I did. Oh, my God. - Why would you do that to me? - Grace, stop, listen. No, don't tell me to stop. I let you sleep with me, Conrad! I let you sleep with me. Grace, I love you. I don't want to see your face. I never want to see anything of you ever again. Mom? Dad? What's wrong? Gracie! I'm sorry. We thought he'd be OK. And then when he wasn't... I just didn't know what to do. You mighta saved that boy's life... and you might not have. Gonna be an old man one day and you'll still wonder. Yeah. OK. As we get older, we all come to a fork in the road. As we choose our path, some of us grow wiser... and some of us don't. Some relationships last... some disappear. But what once was, can't stay the same... no matter how much we wish it otherwise. Truth is, no one gets it right, but I think we're all supposed to try. Mr. Turner, please. There's something I need to tell you. I'm sorry. I don't remember what I said on that porch that evening, or how her parents exactly reacted. Moments like that, they cloud your memory. Leave only a feeling... a feeling you can't ever shake. Wherever she is, I hope she's OK. Losing someone, you don't really ever get over it. I'm home. Hey. You have a good night? Yeah. Pretty good, I guess. Well, that's good. Go on inside and tell your Mom you're home. Mom. Making peace with the past, well, sometimes it seems impossible. Maybe it's supposed to be. Dad, you coming? Yeah. I'm coming, Eric. Subtitles by explosiveskull
