Who is he? The Hunter (2011) DVDRip Wait at the bar. This is not the way to greet an old friend. You kept me waiting for 2 weeks. Right! It's Paris. See the sights. I am here for work. It is a little grand to cover. Difficult terrain. Remote. They told me to send someone with you. Two men is security risk. This is an important job. There is no room for mistake. So do not make any. It must be very nice, William. Not to need anyone? The client is Red Leaf. A military biotech. They're after something extremely rare. You are to bring back biological samples. Blood, skin, hair, organs. For the rest, make sure no one else can ever find it. What Red Leaf wants is very valuable. Tasmanian Tiger. But only if they have exclusives on it. You're looking for something most believe it's extinct. The rarest, most inclusive creature on the planet. Client has evidence it still exists. If so, it may be the very last one. THE HUNTER The client has his reports from a reliable source. Two confirmed sightings in the last year. Until now, these sightings have been kept secrets... ...but word always gets out. We have only a couple of months, maybe less. After that there will be competition. Perhaps there already is. Hello? Hey! What are you doing? You can't wake her up. I'm Martin David, from the University. Hello, Martin David. My name's Sass. This is my brother Bike. Mom said we should take you to see your room. Come on. - The bulb is gone. - No, we have no fucking power. - Excuse me? - It's the generator. Stopped working. You're gonna fix it? I got plenty stuff that needs power. It worked before, but then stopped. Dad says that fuck is fucking broken. - Where is your father? - Got away. Up there. But he'll be back soon. He can fix it if you can't. It's cold water in the hottub. And the toilet is outside. - Are you okay man? - Just need to use the restroom. You wanna drink first? Right. - Beer? - Sure. SAVE OUR NATIVE FORESTS - How much the rent of a room? - No vacancies. - Not even one small room? - Already preoccupied by livings. I can pay double. May tripled if you want. Doesn't make any difference. Hey, you! - You wanna rent? - Yeah. Yeah. When you can have one. -You're from US, don't you? - Does it mean you got a room? I can pay. No. The thing is...might We already have a lot of greenies. So, if you enjoy your life, Jarrah fucking Armstrong... ...fuck off. - You're on, Dougie. - I come. I've arrived. The lodging is... not what I excepted. The communication may be a problem. So, I call when I have something to report. What is she singing about? She sounds sad. Yelling like that. She's not yelling. Have you ever listen music? Jo. Dad loves "The Boss". Who? "The Boss". Bruce Springsteen. He rocks. Shouldn't come here without knocking. You're looking for my dad? No, I'm researching Tasmanian devils. If you see him, will you tell him to come home? I'll be up dozen days, then I'll come back for two days to supply my paperwork. And I'm not back until Wednesday next week. Take with you this when you go up. Keep it for while. It's my Dad. We gave it to him for his birthday. It's what he looks like. Okay. 44.30 ... Those are my coordinates. They're points on the map. Now, listen. - When your mother wakes up ... - I know. Dozen days. Jack's here! - Where are my soldiers? - Jack! Hey, little princess. Hi, Bike. There he is. - Good night. Jack Mindy. - Martin David. How's going? - Is the room allright? - Yeah, it's fine. Thanks. If there is something just let me know. Sort it out. As good as it is. Quiet, convenient. The block from the university told me you needed a guy. - Really? - Yeah. I can take camp... - No, no, I, I don't... - No, no, no, it's not problem. Get your stuff and follow me in your truck. Alright? Who were they? Greenies who are against deforestation. - Jarrah was the kingpin. - The children's father? Jarrah, yeah. A lot of time Jarrah is a good block, a real greenie. - Where is he now? - He went missing last summer. He was out doing in his rescue work and never came back. - Didn't the university tell you? - Different university. Anyway. Rescue team searched after him for two weeks... ...not a trace. And his wife? Lucy is not doing too good. She is... um, I do what I can to help. Your rent money will help them for a while . All way back is logged. - What is it you study? - Devils. They are a nuisance. Still, makes a change. From what? There are a lot of tourists chasing Tasmanian tigers. They think they can take a ticket for day trip... ...and find an animal that it's been known extinct. - What do you think? - I heard one once. I was a kid. I was camping with my dad. 50 years ago but I still remember. I mean, there again some claim sees one but... ...no one can ever prove it. On the Sunday stroll,...you want it Mr. David. Paddle is highlands. Never been mapped. There are satellite maps, but it doesn't mean that anyone has ever been there. What do you think happened to Jarrah Armstrong? Slipped, fell, broke a leg, froze, starved... And then devil got him. Eat you alive if give them a chance. Although not to find a trace. Well, depends if any one of them tries lift. I knew some enemies of Jarrah. He was a foreigner not like yourself. And decided to save the trees. Logging trees is the only reason for any people here at all. For the town his appearance was as popular as... ...a snake in a sleeping bag. - God! - The word of the day, Mr. David. Thank you, Mr. Mindy. I'll take it from here. You what? I'd like to go alone. - Are you sure? It's... - Yes, I'm sure. Well, suit yourself. I will leave it to you then. See you in couple weeks. And watch your steps. GO HOME GREENIE SCUM Good day. You're back then. - You're intimidated? - Sort of. - Seen many "devils"? - Yes. Sick or healthy? Healthy. Don't let me stand in your way. Brought some supplies. Dinner is in the kitchen. - Is that your father? - What? Yes, he did it. - Why is scratching his head? - He's not. Looking for something. But you never guess what for. - Away out of here? - A tiger. Really? A tiger? - What kind of tiger? - A Tasmanian tiger. A Tasmanian tiger? - That's very interesting, but you know, they no longer exist. - No. Oh, are not. My dad saw one last summer. It's a secret. Must have told someone else. Somebody, besides you? - Have other people seen it? - I do not know. Ask him. Hello. I heard you're doing some research on the plato, "Devils", right? - Yes, that's right. - Very cool. - I'm Free by the way. He's Simon. - How's it going? You should stop by some time. We'd love to hear about your work. Sorry, but I don't have any time. You're not using traps up there, are you? Steel traps? No. I won't do that. Thanks. I bet you've helped your dad too. What is that? A monkey's face? OK. Here we go. - Where did these come from? - It's a prescription from a doctor. Mindy Jack brings them. Your mother does not need these anymore. So, no more, OK? OK. Go and run the bath. Sass, come help me. Wash her fingers. I have to go back up tomorrow. You gonna have to take care your mother. - She's gonna feel sick. - OK. Give her lots of tea, water and rest. - OK? - OK. Out! You can't come with me. You know these are exctint. They're gone. I don't know what your father told you but he couldn't have seen one. Come on. Well, if I see one, you will be first to know. - Where is your mother? - In town with Jack Mindy. She's better now. Did you find anything? It's not my dad's. - What are you doing? - We're going in. - No, you can't. - But we always do. - Wait until I finished. - No, the water'll be cold. Besides, my dad says when we have a bath it's shame... ...to waste all the hot water. I am not your dad and I do not think your mom would like this. - He tells us a story. - I do not know any. - None? - No. - Not even one story? - No. - What she keeps singing about then? - She's just singing. What would it be? People never sing about all things. I've never met someone does it. She can not sing about all thing. So what she sings about? He's back. - I'll better come in. - I'll be fine. I'll see you soon. Thanks. Want some water? - Hi. - Hey, Mom. They do not like to waste the hot water. - You guys hungry? - Yes. I'll get the dinner ready. A tiger in the trees. Which trees? There are lots of trees out there. Winter appears something else, especially when the snow comes. - A little wine? - No. He drinks tea. - Jamie! Dinner is ready. - Who's Jamie? - His name is now Bike. - Bike? Not a bad name. What about you, Katie? Dou you have a new name? - Sass. From "Sassafras." - It's very pretty. - Jamie? - I'll go and get him. Hey ... time to eat. - So, Mr. David ... - Call me Martin. Martin, how's the study going? Definitely the kids cause much troble. No. Not too much trouble. - I ... - Katie, it's disgusting! - He likes it stronger. - Like Jarrah. My husband would liek the tea with color of rust. - Have you ever read his book? - No, I haven't but it's on the top of my list. Honey, go get daddy's book. Do they teach all the changes these days? Same stuff. Hasn't change much in the past ten years. Do you know Judge Morris? He's form your neighborhood. Columbia, right? I couldn't find it. Finished. Can you tell us a story? - Martin and I'd like to have a little chat. After that... - You promised. After that, I'll do. OK? Katie said that you washed me. In the bath. The children helped. I'm not a bad mother. It's just hard. What are those speakers in the trees? Jarrah. He wanted to have concerts supply when we moved in. I had this idea to gather here artists, scientist, town's people... ...like festival of Woodstock. I had lots of ideas. Too many. Too many to hold even one. We are lucky, Jack sent you. . - Hey everybody, he's Martin David like I told you. - Hi. Hello. What did you to your eye? - I got a stick in it. - Gorgeous. - Where is your mother? - She's inside. In the kitchen. What's going on? - We have a little Woodstock festival? - You're back! Your eye ...my god! What happened? Sit down. Sit down. It's not too bad. We're gonna....Logging the forest on road... ...another touch in next six months, after...complete ecologic survey. - We're celebrating. - They are friends of yours? I helped with documents and interpretation of some researches. I was doing my PhD Plant Science when I met Jarrah. Ecophysiology. You look different. I went to the hairdresser. - Do you like it? - I liked the better before. These, all the signs of the tiger killed. She eats the heart first. And this is the cave. She's been there. She probably has dents all around the area. She moved between... ...but sooner or later she will be back here. I wonder if she's the last one. Alone. Just... ...hunting and killing, waiting to die. Hello. Why won't you telling the university. No. Thank you. Guess you will be heading North since you got what you wanted. No, cut off the job. - Working for the government. - Searching for tigers. - National Parks found footprints. - It's a fucking top secret! And we know the area, so... There is no tigers up there. - You don't know that. You only know what they want you to know. - Here we go. Maybe ...a pile of money if we find a Tasmanian tiger. Cloning and shit. You're a scientist. What will you do if you find a tiger? It is not my field. I just point his nice job wasted down the road on the wind. So Jarrah would've done. Isn't that right Lucy? - Take the kids inside. - Come on. Katie. Listen, fellows ... It's not personal. When you take away our jobs, it's personel damn right. -Come on man. You're gonna shoot the women...? - Get out of here. Are you gonna doing that way? Yeah. Come in. I'm making tea. Would you like some? - No, thank you. - You sure? No. I'm gonna turn it. I got to go back up early tomorrow morning. I'm sorry about tonight. Do you think those people have something to do with y...your husband? No. They're angry that they're out of work but they wouldn't hurt us. On monday their kids will go to school with my kids. Jarrah thought that somebody was following him though. Not one of the locals. Well, if not, then who? My husband pissed off a lot of people. - You tell the police? - Yes, they said that there was no evidence. No will. Body. Besides, they knew Jarrah was there and what he looks like. Do you belive that someone was following him? I believe he believed it. How is it going Mr. Mindy? I heard there have been a trouble up the hill, last night? Everything is under control. Maybe I should talk to the University ... ...find you somewhere else to live, somewhere with less distractions. Lucy is better. She is off the pills and the kids are fine too. I don't think you need to come around so much. - Hello? - This is Jack Mindy from Tasmania. - Yes, Jack? - You said to call if there was any problems. - Go on. Well, the scientist of yours, he's... He's becoming a problem. Mam?. Beer, please. You think you can get back here. Why don't you go up there, with the greenies chaps, ha? I know what you're up to man. All fucking town knows about it. It's what a waste of the taxes. You and fucking Armstrong bitch deserve each other. Stay away! Good. Clever boy. -It arranges father. -I help him while he is away. -Can I help? -Well, then. Thank you! -What worked with your husband here? -Worked and worked ... He worked for Red Leaf? I saw the name on the back of one of children's drawings. I thought he had burned everything. They made him paranoid. -Why? -He chased a tiger there. He said the tiger had a specific poison that paralyzed prey. And that Red Leaf would have exclusive rights to its DNA. Jarrah tried to stop them. It's probably best that it is extinct. If it did, people would constantly look for it and chase it. -Mother? I can not sleep. -What is it, Katie? -I am afraid. I will sleep in your bed. -Okay, I come. Shall we go on a picnic tomorrow if we get nice weather? Good night. -May we take pyllerne with? No! I do not even know what a pyller is. Pyllerne. Hens! Cross, where you look! Do you really want to be seen with us? Yes. Will you talk to him? It is for you. N u he will come. -David Martin. - I've heard stuff. You attract your attention and interact with the locals. Concentrate on the task, otherwise someone ahead of us. I have found a cave ... a sort of cave. I've been there. Why are you there now? We will see results. I'll get your result. pardon -What do you mean? -I must be up there again. -I must finish my work. -What about the children? -Here are my coordinates ... -Forget it. Get down on your knees and face away from me. Where is the cave? What cave? Hands by your sides, palms up. Where is the cave? - Up there. - How far? Two hours of walking. You need to take me there. Let's going! I can't navigate like this. Jack! Jack? Stay there! You stay there! - Do not you make me. - Where are they? It was an accident. Police... ...said it was an accident. Candles landed inside the barn and incinerated the house. Where are they now, Jack? Lucy and the girl...are dead. They're dead. The boy? I took him away from here. I can't look after him at my age. I found a good place for him. Was someone paying you to follow me, to keep an eye on me? No. I thought you were a scientist, like Jarrah. No one is paying me. You should've never come here. What did you tell them, you idiot? They sent someone to replace me. Will send someone to replace him... ...and will keep on sending people until they get what they want. What you want is gone forever. Do not bother looking for me. I'm going to see the sights. The Hunter (2011) DVDRip
