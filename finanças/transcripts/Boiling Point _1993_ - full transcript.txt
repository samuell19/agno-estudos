I'll have it here. - Be with you in a minute. - Sure. Here you go, man. Two burgers, two coffees. Six bucks. - Fredrick, how's it been, man? - 'Pretty good, man, thanks.' Alright. Take care. - 'Alright, you too.' - See ya around. - So? - All set. Did like I told you? No problem. The phone will ring in ten minutes. Put this on it. [laughs] [siren wailing] [indistinct chatter] - What time you got? - 10:20. That's what I got. [male #1] 'Hey, Train.' 'He's getting there.' 'Better wake up Brady.' Hmm, wise-ass. - 'And all set for tomorrow?' - What's tomorrow? [male #1] 'Saturday, man, we're taking little Train' 'on the pony rides, remember?' Oh, shit, I forgot. Ah, she wasn't gonna go for it, anyway. [male #1] 'Yeah, she want him to grow up and be a pussy' 'like his old man?' 'Just tell her his godfather is countin' on her.' Alright, it's time. I think you'd better make that call. [telephone ringing] - Yeah. - 'Hello, Ronnie.' 'This is Salvatore. You together?' 'Room 105 at the Hollywood Vine Motel.' 'Come alone.' [Ronnie] 'Okay.' [Salvatore] 'He'll be right over. He said he's right down the street.' 'You know, he sounded a little nervous over the phone.' What's he carrying, Jimmy? Two-inch in his ankle holster. [instrumental music] [knocking] Here he is. [Ronnie] 'I've got the paper in the case. Let's see the real stuff.' [Salvatore] 'Take it easy, ten grand's right here in the paper bag.' 'Here, take a look.' [gunshot] [tires screeching] Shit! Oh, Jesus. [Brady] 'Yeah. Brady.' 'We got shots fired an agent down.' '1133 Vine Street.' Requesting agent-in-charge and police notification. Yeah. Never had a fuckin' chance. [man on speaker] 'San Fernando, Oxnard, San Bruno' 'Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo..' Well, stage one is complete. We're ahead of the game by ten grand. That's not bad for openers. You know, I noticed when he went down he had an ankle gun on him. I mean, if, if I hadn't done him, he would've done me. Right? You did exactly the right thing. That was a major leap. I'm proud of you, kid. Your old Red buddy is proud, do you hear that? Proud. And you know what the best part is? There ain't gonna be any heat from the cops. When they find that stiff the first thing they're gonna do is take fingerprints. Then they're gonna see that this guy has got an arrest sheet. Then they're gonna figure it was just another thief's beef. And that's as far as it goes. Case closed. I know how they think. To them, a dead thief is just less work. [man on speaker] 'Your attention, please, this is your first call..' Come on. First thing you do.. Dump the car. You've got a good spot? What about Central Avenue? Cops will just think an African-American stole it. I like that. [laughing] What about the sawn-off? Ah, it's okay there for a while. Listen, what you want to do, kid is take a few days off and enjoy yourself. See that broad that you were always talking about in the joint, huh? How does that sound? - What are you gonna do? - Same thing. I almost forgot. Here's a grand for you, right off the top. Buy yourself some clothes or somethin'. I'm gonna need the rest of this to start settin' up that friend I was telling you about. These things take money. You got to put the bucks in.. [both] To get the bucks out. The suckers are out there, kid. They're just waiting for your old Red buddy. I'm telling you, kid, if you trust me you'll be set for life. And that is no lie. Go get him, kid. [instrumental music] [knocking] Oh, it's you. Yeah. Listen, I just wanna see JC for a minute. Are you serious? He's been asleep for hours. Yeah, I know that. I'm not gonna wake him, I just wanna see him. Why can't this wait until tomorrow? It's Saturday, he'll be home from school. Look, are you gonna let me see him or not? Alright, but don't wake him. Where'd you find him? Steven and I met in class. If that's what you mean. Well, you think you could get rid of him? - I wanna talk to you. - I can't do that. Besides, there's nothing we have to talk about. Russo got killed tonight. [instrumental music] [music continues] Hi, Mona. What the hell are you doing here? I just thought I'd stop by now that I'm out. I heard the bad news. [sighs] So, what do you want? What do you mean, what do I want? I just got out and I came here. 'Doesn't that mean anything to you?' Yeah, trouble, which I don't need. Now, get the hell out of here. I know what you probably think about me. 'But that's what I want to talk to ya about.' This last stretch has brought me to my senses. I finally wised up. And believe me, that is no lie. No lie? That's all you can do. That's your stock and trade. You are not capable of telling the truth. You're sick. Not anymore. I mean, I used to be. But now.. Now, what, a new man? - Yeah. - Bullshit. Listen, I just got out a month ago myself and there's no way in the world I'm going back in there unless I'm dumb enough to let a piece of shit like you back in my life. His name is Steven. And he happens to be an extremely sensitive and understanding person. Yeah, well, then he'll understand me stayin' over tonight. First of all, you're not stayin' over. And if you did, he's secure enough to accept whatever explanation I choose to give him. Well, then, you better come up with a good one because I'm stayin'. That's not gonna change anything. That's right. I see you living better than ever. Hmm? Even better than we did before. I don't like to see you slingin' hash. It really hurts me. [scoffs] Slinging hash hurts you. But making your wife turn tricks to pay off your debt.. ...that you can live with. Making me a whore to save your ass is okay. That somehow doesn't hurt. For you to do what? Pull another one of your swindles? One of your operations and end up in prison anyway? - Listen, Mona-- - Don't you dare touch me! You are, without a doubt the lowest piece of dog shit on the face of this earth. Does that mean that we won't be seein' each other later? I get off in an hour. No more bullshit. I want you outta here right now. Okay. [groaning] That's not what you want. Is it? Maybe you're right about this not bein' the life.. ...for you and JC. Of course I'm right. Your way of life makes no sense at all. It never did. And it's just too big a price to pay, honey. Yeah, well, Russo didn't think so. Russo didn't have a wife and kid. Ex-wife. Listen, Red, I'm gonna be serious. No yelling, no screaming. Just straight talk from me to you. Sure, babe. I want you to get up, put on your clothes and get out of here. I don't ever want to see you again. Ever. Is that straight enough? Jesus, what the hell brought this on? Don't make me say it again. Just do it. You mean I can't even call you to say hello you know, just to make sure that you're alright? Don't start with the con, not now. Well, Jesus, you could have fooled me. What the hell was this all about then, huh? What is this, a mercy fuck? I don't know. Maybe it was. Maybe it was more for me than you. But that's something you wouldn't understand. [instrumental music] Yeah, I know it's expensive, but on the other hand it's not exactly what you've been getting at home. Yeah, Tony Dio, please. [sighs] Well, you should have told that to Frankie, the bell captain. He would have told you there's no exceptions. So, it's up to you, honey. You know what it is. That's right. 'So, do I come up or not?' I'll be right there. That's great timing. You tell Tony I'm in the lobby. Right, right, I'll be right up. - Hey. - Penthouse? - How did you know that? - Tony Dio, right? Oh, the phones. Hey, my name is, uh, Red Diamond. Huh? - Ha-ha, what's your name? - Vikki Dunbar. Hey, you know, if you're not doing anything tonight, uh I could use a little company myself. - I'm busy tonight. - Oh, yeah? How about tomorrow, huh? Why don't you talk to Frankie, the bell captain? Oh, yeah. Just ask for Vikki. He'll know what you want. Okay, it's Vikki. Jesus. No sleep, no shave. Am I in that much trouble? It's good to see you again, Jimmy. How long are you in town for? We'll let the department decide that. - You had breakfast yet? - No, I'm not hungry. Come on, have some coffee. We got a lot to talk about. [Red] I mean, I'm-I'm just sayin' all I need is another couple of months. You know, to sort of get back on my feet. Red.. In the old days you know, when we were just, uh, starting out to.. Ha-ha, hey, Tony. There was no quibbling about a couple of bucks here or there. - Right. - You know why? We were young. [laughing] And when you're young you got plenty of time. Sit down, sit down. Ah, but, now.. ...we're not young anymore, huh? So, time is very important. In fact.. ...it is the most important thing we got or haven't got, in your case. Do you understand what I'm trying to say to you, Red? Do I understand? You don't have to tell the old redhead about time. I just did a nickel in Terminal Island. And when you're over 50, that's doing real hard time. This is it for me, Tony. My last shot. So, when I tell you I got a real big project all set to go it's set to go. So, what are you telling me? I'm telling you.. I mean, I'm just sayin' that as soon as this project goes off I'll be able to pay you off, with interest for the whole five years. Anyway, what do you got to worry about? You know that I'm good for a lousy 50 grand. Now, first of all.. ...I never worry about getting paid. He does. And second, I know you're good for it. Ah. That's why I let the debt ride while you were in the joint. Yeah, but now you're out. So, we gotta talk about how you'll make it good. - But that's what I'm sayin'. - Well, you see.. You're telling me and you're sayin' again. How much did you bring with you today? Eight grand. Here, put it here. So, what's the problem? - Take your time with the rest. - Ah, Tony. [laughing] Take another seven days. I'll wait a week. How 'bout another 30 days, huh? I mean, you know, there's always these last-minute details to work out-- Thanks for dropping by, Red. Tony, seven days, huh? Alright. Your operation wasn't by the book. It should've gone down out in the open. No one waved the book at all the others that Russo and I busted. Look, don't be naive. This time, we lost one of ours. [sighs] So, what are they gonna do to me? They've done it. You're transferred. - To Newark. - To Newark? Oh, shit! As of when? As of when I left Washington. I'll assign someone else to this mess. No, no, no. You can't do that. Now, you gotta give me time, you gotta delay this thing until I can find the son of a bitch who killed Russo. The director'll never go for it. Fuck the director. Look, you just tell him that I'm the only one that saw the killer and can identify him. He'll sit still for that. You know it. - Did you? - Jerry, I need time. You gotta give me two weeks. Hell, give me one week. I just need a little time so I can find the guy. I mean, have you got anything to go on? Not a goddamn thing. But neither will anybody else that you put in here to try to replace me. Look, Jerry, Russo is my responsibility. He was my friend. You gotta do this for me, as a personal favor. Alright, I'll give you one week, but that's it. Seven days, and you're outta here. But you got to give me your word on something. What's that? You keep your head. Nothing crazy. It's got to be by the book. Do I have your word? You got it. And I give you my word on something else, too. When I find this motherfucker I'm gonna put him in a box. By the book. [Jimmy] I'll see you later. I got us a week. - What did you get? - Zip. I spent the morning going through the mug book like I know what I'm looking for. Good. I don't think we got a good look. - Anything overnight? - Nothing at the motel. No hair, no prints, no nothing. All the internal reports come up empty. Well, now we won't have to waste valuable time on hard evidence. [gunshot] [tires screeching] [Jimmy on speaker] 'Shit!' Jimmy, the guy must have cased the motel. That's why he wanted Russo in 105. Otherwise, it would have been easy to park at a lot. Wait a minute. I didn't hear him start the car. He just got in and just drove away. Getaway driver. So, now, there's two of them. [telephone ringing] Shit! Tech room, Mercer. 'You sure?' - Alright, thank you. - What have you got? Lab says the fifties come off of an old Freddie Roth printing. First time they showed up in five years. I was gonna approve the pass until I find out about his old lady. - His old lady? - She wrote him a Dear John. We still read all mail coming in. One of our few remaining privileges. It seems she moved in with her brother since Freddie has been in here. He thinks he smuggled this out to her. He says he's gonna get out of here and kill 'em both. Long time, Freddie. Have a seat. This place is a little different from my old Malibu pad, huh? - Remember those days? - Yeah, I remember. What do you want to talk to me about? Some of your old fifties have shown up recently. - Which old fifties? - The ones that got you here. - Remember? - Yeah. The plate had a bad key on the treasury seal. I should have burned the whole bunch before I put them out on the street. Who has the rest of the notes, Freddie? Now, wait a minute. You come here to lay a goddamn case on me while I'm in the joint, huh? What the hell do I know about who has a few fifties I printed five years ago? How the hell do I know what's happening on the street, man? I'm in the cage. I'm in a cage, man. Thank you, Freddie. Sorry to have bothered you. What? You can go back to D-wing. I don't have any more questions. No, wait-wait-wait, wait-wait, wait a minute. What if I was to remember something about a stash on the outside? What's in it for me? What do you want to be in it for you, Freddie? Well, it's like this, man. I'm on the list for a gate pass so I can work outside on the grass. I'm sick, man. I need a little fresh air and sunshine. Vitamin C, you know. You talk to the captain, you get my name moved up on that list I might be able to remember something about the fifties. - 'Will you talk to him?' - I already did. But listen, man, if anybody.. ...finds out that I'm talking to the Feds, I could end up getting shanked. There's guys in here that actually like to do it. Who has your stash, Freddie? I gave it to a friend to hold for me. He got about 50 grand. This friend have a name? He's a real friend, man. I don't wanna see him drop behind a deal when he's just doin' me a favor. You know what I mean? How bad do you want this gate pass, Freddie? Hmm? What's his name? [sighs] 'Virgil Leach.' He deals in paper, but he's just holding it. He said he wouldn't pass any. Where do I find him? [sighs] He used to hang out at the Paradise Isle downtown. Want another drink? Yeah, Scotch and water. Hey, look, you sure this Virgil Leach guy's comin' in here? He'll be here, it's still early yet. Alright, when he comes in, tell him I'm sittin' at that back table there, alright? 'Okay.

Yeah, you could say that. Look, I'm looking to make a couple of bucks before I go back East. You know, maybe score some paper or some cashier's checks, or something that'd go down easy without an ID. Sorry, I can't help you there, pal. Well, well, Freddie told me that you could. He said, I should tell you that I got all the right connections to come up with the buy money. How fast could you deal? Tonight fast enough for you? Yeah. You interested in some really nice green stuff? What flavor? Numero50. Ten different serial numbers. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. How much heat is on the batch? Look, if the Feds are onto the serial numbers I don't wanna have nothin' to do with it, alright? I can't go back to TI. No, no, no, no way, man. This product is cool.

Glad you could make it. - Hi. - Hi. I was really looking forward to this. Then I'll try not to disappoint you. Well, I'm sure you wouldn't have to try too hard. Did you get a room, or do you want me to? No, you know, I don't think we're gonna need one, um.. I've got something else in mind. Oh, yeah? Like what? Well, are your, uh are your shoes comfortable? What, are we gonna take a walk in the park? No, but for what we're gonna do you really need a good pair of shoes. Wait a minute. I'm not very good at this kind of thing, okay? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

What do you got, a two-way mirror back there? A couple of peepers there? [laughs] Sit down. Hey, aren't you gonna warn me of my constitutional rights? No need to. You already been bought and paid for. So, you deliver four counterfeit fifties to the man. And that is that. You wanna know what I think? I think I was entrapped into this whole thing. And I think that we should cut the shit and see if we can cut a deal. Now, what I want is the names of everybody you dealt the fifties to and the location of the rest of the stash. That's what I want. Now, you tell me what you want. Doesn't matter what I want or don't want. 'Cause I ain't saying a fucking thing. And that's no shit. You must be one of them freaks that actually likes the joint, huh? - Is that it? - Yeah, that's it. I like the joint about as much as I like looking at your face. 'But I've been around long enough to know' 'that since I'm on parole' 'I'm gonna be violating.' 'Which means I pick up another 18 months' 'of which I'll only have to do six.' Or, in your case, uh, with the four fifties? That will be dropped by the US Attorney in the interest of justice 'so as not to clog up the court.' 'Since I'm already going back to prison' I mean, what the hell's four fifties anyway, right? Huh? [chuckling] Hey, I'm lookin' at four months. Maybe only three. Seeing as how the joint is so overcrowded they're giving early out time. So, for 90 days you want me to become a snitch? Take a chance at getting a shiv stuck up my ass? No way, man. No fucking way. Yeah, but there's one thing you're forgetting. What about your old lady? Let me tell you something. If I find the stash in your pad and she's there I'm gonna bust her ass. You wanna get her involved? What the fuck do I care? She's a dumb junkie bitch. A friend of mine gave her to me. When you guys go there and you find counterfeit money it's hers, not mine. [door pounding] [pounding continues] Counterfeit possession with priors, Connie, is very serious. Very serious. So? So, we want you to tell us who Virgil was peddling to. I'm not a snitch. You know, Connie, you don't look so good. When is the last time you had a fix, huh? Ah! Ah, you're making me throw up. You'll have plenty of time for that in jail tonight, Connie to give yourself the dope. [coughing] Who did Virgil give some of the counterfeit money to? - Nobody. - Bullshit! He's holding it for a partner who went to the joint. He didn't wanna pass it 'cause the Feds had the serial numbers or some shit. I don't know. I don't know! Well, I think you better get dressed. Man, the bag is Virgil's, not mine. Connie, thinking back, did you ever see Virgil give even one of these counterfeit fifties to anyone? Huh? Talk! Virgil's the only man who ever showed me respect. I'm not rollin' over on him or none of his friends. Go ahead and put my ass in prison. I'll just sit there. [Virgil] 'What the fuck do I care?' 'She's a dumb junkie bitch.' 'A friend of mine gave her to me.' 'When you guys go there and you find counterfeit money' 'it's hers, not mine.' You call that respect, Connie? [sobbing] Fine. Fine. Virgil told me to deliver some samples to a guy who'd be in front of the Palace. When was that? Well, a guy came by a couple days ago. He said he needed 'em for a scam or somethin'. What kind of scam? He didn't say and Virgil didn't ask. Who is the man? What was his name? Virgil called him Red. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] - Hi. - Hey. Hey. You'll never believe in a million years what I've been doing. [laughs] I don't think I have that long, so you might as well tell me. The happy hooker plays Ginger Rogers. 'Could you believe I've been dancing?' Was that Fred Astaire who just kissed you goodnight? He was actually a sweet man. You'd like him. 'Vikki, what are you drinking?' [Vikki] Um, the usual. Thanks. Well, this makes it the perfect evening. I get to see my favorite T-man. 'So, how are things back at the mint?' Russo got killed Friday. There goes the perfect evening. You wanna talk about it? No. You wanna go get something to eat? I'm not hungry. Well, if we're not gonna talk, and we're not gonna eat.. ...what are we gonna do? Why don't you get the drinks and the rest of the night's on me? Anyway, you saw that John that I was with before. Yeah, from a distance. What does he have to do with it? Well, that's how it all started. Turns out, all he wanted was someone to go dancing with. You know me. Anything to please. So, away we went. And of all places, we went to the Palace. It seems the poor guy was dumped by his old lady or something. So, all he could talk about was how he used to get off dancing to all those bands that used to be so popular. Anyways, he starts getting heavy into this nostalgia trip and I thought the poor guy was gonna break down and cry. Especially when they started playing one of those slow, mushy ones. So, then, he just clams up, closes his eyes and I know he's not with me anymore. Well, he never really was, anyways. So, there he is, thinking about his old lady like I wasn't even there. So, I figure I'd do the same thing. I'll think about someone that I'd like to be with. And what do you know, folks? I come up with you. Hello? - Hmm. - Mr. Excitement. Well, how did I do? Better than I thought. Good. You ever take your old lady dancing like that? Nope. Would you take me someday, maybe? Yeah, if you let me go to sleep. It's a deal. Hey, Max. Good to see ya. I heard you were out. Yeah. Last week, huh? Thought I'd drop by to say hello. Glad you did. Listen, um, I'm right in this building. You drop by and see me sometime. Anytime, Red. Uh, what about now, huh? No time like the present, huh? Can't do it, Red. There are people waiting in the office. Uh, this'll just take a minute, Max, listen. I'm onto something really big here, you know? It's a monster. It's gotta be my biggest score yet. Listen, it's an oil lease deal with a structure that's foolproof, and all I need is a little backin'. - And not a whole bunch.. - Red, please. I know you just got out and all that and how tough it was. I'm sorry. But there are too many people involved in this kind of thing. The cops are onto you. You've been down too many times. Now, you take my advice, you forget about this. You won't raise a nickel with another scam. - Hey, you didn't let me finish. - Oh, I'll finish it for you. The answer is no, nothing, nada. - Hey, Max-- - Don't touch. Please. Okay? How 'bout you loaning me, personally? Fifty grand. Hey, now, you know I'm good for it, huh? See, this is what you said to my people five years ago and you leave them sucking wind. Hey, I ended up in the stinking, fucking joint. Don't you do that to me. You know how sorry I am about that. How sorry you are? You'd be sorry if I'd have handed you up to the grand jury. What is this, Red? What? You tell me. What is this? Is, this is a shakedown? You think you're gonna muscle a lawyer with a beef where the statute's already run out? Don't be a schmuck. No, you owe me. For keeping my mouth shut. And for walking that fucking yard alone. That's what I think. Well, your thinking's all wrong. You come to me for bucks. Don't you bring me some scam, some daisy chain bullshit. You bring me something tangible. Coke, grass, papers, stocks, bonds, I don't know. Now, you have my card...use it. This is everyone from LAPD and sheriff's records. - Great job. - You got a minute? Yeah. - Okay, what have we got? - Just what ya asked for. We got a photo of every red-headed male adult ever arrested in Los Angeles County in the last 15 years. Nine hundred forty-six of 'em. - Good luck. - Alright. Help me get these together so I could take 'em down to lock-up and show Connie. 'Forget it, Jimmy.' Connie was released on her own recognizance at 07:00 hours. I don't believe it. Connie! 'Connie!' Connie, no! No, don't! [explosion] What do you think about this? I just got this today. You cannot tell the difference between this and a real one. What do you mean? It's your lucky piece, right? No, not this one. That was an earlier sample. Wasn't perfect. Now, I went to the guy that makes these, huh? To redo it. Now, it's a winner. Huh? This is a dummy? Dummy? No, it's real. I mean, it-it's not real. It looks real, huh? How many you got? Well, that's the problem. Guy doesn't have enough cash, you know? To go into full production. The way I got this mapped out is we need another score to make this move.. Well, what about the money from the hotel? It's already bein' used, uh, you know to set up the front I was telling you about. I've even got a firm doing market research just to make sure that the suckers are there. Huh? Old Red, buddy, does not miss a trick. Market research? Like I said.. ...we need another score. You pull this off, partner we're on our way to Vegas and that is no lie. So, you say you got my name from Stimey? - Yeah, I met him in TI. - Oh. Stimey. He's a good man. I got a letter from him a week ago. He's doin' his time real easy. Did you? Well, the letter must've come by pony express 'cause Stimey got iced in a fight six weeks ago. [chuckling] You can't blame me for being too careful. No. Difficult time for this sort of thing. Mm-hmm. So, do we talk or what? What quantity are we talkin' about? Two hundred and fifty grand. Well, I've seen better. I can offer you ten points on the package that's 25,000 for you. Thirty points is the usual price. [chuckles] Where is that, Poland? Fifteen, that's it. I oughta get 20 or I walk. Okay, tough guy, 20. I don't have time to quibble. Okay, so.. Twenty into 250. That's 50 grand for you, you get it in $100 bills. I get to see the buy money first. - Oh, you do? - Yeah. Well, that's customary, don't you worry about it. And it's gotta be tonight. - How's 9:00 PM? - Okay. You go to the north side of the parking lot at Union Station. You know Union Station? - Yeah. - You wanna write this down? - No. - There's a phone booth there. I suggest you get there early to avoid any problems. At 9:00 PM, exactly 9:00 PM, the phone will ring. When you answer it, you'll get your final instructions. Now, Ronnie. Is it Ronnie? [chuckles] You make the delivery five minutes after you get the phone call. If it doesn't ring exactly at 9:00 PM, the deal is off. There's somethin' gone wrong. Hey, you, you understand me? Yeah. [Max] 'Any questions?' [sighs] Yeah. Who's gonna do the deal at the station? Well, Ronnie, the one thing I guarantee is it's not gonna be me. Well, that's a, that's a shame. Kinda feel better if it was. [phone ringing] - Yeah. - 'Ronnie, the deal is on.' [indistinct] [male #1] 'You're together?' Who the fuck are you? I work for Max, I'm here to do some business. Why didn't you say so? Yeah, I'm together. Let's see your buy money. Max doesn't buy anything without seein' the full package. Max said I could see the buy money first. 'No, that's not the way it works.' This is safer for everybody. You know what I'm saying? Look, I don't wanna get ripped off any more than you do. So, I'll show you the papers same time you show me the buy money. Otherwise we stand here jerkin' each other off about who's gonna show first. Right? Right. So, you have no objection to me pattin' you down first, right? Go ahead. I ain't packin'. You got nothin' to worry about from me. Paper's nearby. All I gotta do is give the come ahead. Alright, good, you stand right there where I can see you. Give your mule a come ahead. Fifty grand's right here. [sighs] If anything goes wrong, I'm gonna kill you first. Take it easy. Nothing's gonna go wrong. Call the mule. Nothin' at all. Alright, open the trunk of the car and lay the case down in there and show me the paper. I wanna count it. While I'm doin' that, you can count the money in my belt. Sounds fair enough. Take off the belt. [instrumental music] [gunshot] [gunshot] [music continues] [chuckles] - Red, man! - Hey. [chuckles] Huh? Any problem? Not for our side. Attaboy. Huh? Well, where's the money? Under the seat. Jesus. [laughing] Dear God. Got a little messy. Oh, shit! What? What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. You got dealt a fuckin' gypsy bankroll. Let me see. [Red] You know...we got fucked. That prick Waxman, tradin' paper for paper. I can't fuckin' believe it. Now, I'm really glad I wasted that fucker. We can recover from this. We just gotta use our heads. Yeah.. Yeah, you'll think of somethin'. I mean, you always do. Yeah. You can bet on it, kid. You can bet on somethin' else, too. That whatever it is.. ...next time, it's gonna be for all the fuckin' marbles. [engine revving] Intelligence lists him as a transaction man for an attorney named Max Waxman. Oh, yes, Waxman, I know him. He's a money man. Usually has somebody else to do his dirty work. Uh-huh. - Any witnesses? - No good witnesses. A Japanese tourist saw two men talking by the car, but it was too dark. She can't give a description. You think it's the same guy who did your man, Russo? I know it is. - Mr. Waxman. - Yes. Like to ask you a couple of questions about the murder of your investigator. I've already talked to the police. I have no knowledge of Michael's private affairs. Yes, sir, I understand that, but I would like to talk to you privately. Oh, good, you can talk to me in my office in the morning. It's very private. Sir, I'd rather not. I'm very pressed for time. Yes, sir. This won't take long. Oh, Jesus Christ. It's stuffy down in the garage. Much better out here, don't you think? Where the hell have you taken me? You know, I really don't understand the need for this secrecy. And what do you people have to do with this anyway? I was interviewed by the robbery homicide people last night and if you'd bothered to check, we wouldn't be wasting all this time. They seemed more than satisfied with what I had to say. A week ago, a treasury agent was murdered with a sawed-off shotgun while he was working undercover. Someone using the name Ronnie another man with red hair, about the age of 50 were the ones who did it. I think they were the same ones that dumped your stooge last night. So? So I want you to tell us who they are. And I guarantee that what you say to us won't go any further. [chuckles] Do you gentlemen really expect me to sit here in the back of this car, and give you a statement about something I know absolutely nothing about thus incriminate myself? Did you know I was an attorney at law? May I offer you one of my cards, either of you? We already got your card downtown. It says that you're a money man. And that you never dirty your hands. Then I should keep 'em that way, don't you think? I'll tell you what I think. I think that they came to you with a counterfeit sample. You made the arrangements, and you agreed upon the price. Then, they met your man in the train station and ripped him off. That's what I think. Michael was not acting on my behalf. You don't understand. See, I don't care. I mean, it's, it's history. It's over, forgotten. That is, if you wanna tell us who they are. I mean, you have my word on that. Look, you have nothin' to lose by helping us. On the other hand I have nothing to gain, do I? - Oh, yes, you do. - And what would that be? Our word that we won't completely ruin your business. What does that mean, now, what does that mean you'll ruin my business? I'll tell you what it means. It means that if you don't help us then we turn the heat up full blast the minute you step outside this car. And that tomorrow morning, your whole office is subpoenaed by the federal grand jury. And I guarantee you, TV cameras will be there just when you appear. I'll contact all your clients ask 'em the same questions that I'm asking you. Then I'll put the word out on the street that you're a snitch 'and that you're ready to roll over' 'on every major dealer in town.' I will dedicate my life to fuckin' you over so bad that no one in his right mind will ever wanna put you behind a deal again. You'd be back to chasing ambulances. Stop the car now. I want outta this car, right now! Get your hand off of me, you miserable cock sucker before I break it. If you don't take me back to my office I'm calling the United States attorney and having you brought up on charges of kidnapping and threatening my life. Do you understand? Why wait until we get back? [Waxman] 'Why are you stopping this car?' Don't you wanna make your phone call? [intense music] Either you tell us what you know or we're all gonna take a walk over to that phone booth. 'It's your choice.' What makes you think there's a red-headed guy involved? You first. There's a fellow named Red Diamond just out of Terminal Island. 'A con man, he came by to see me a few days ago' and wanted me to lend him some money. The only redhead I can think of. Ronnie's a walk-in, he came by yesterday. I've never seen him before. I would've never guessed the connection with Red Diamond. [engine revving] It's the right house alright. His name is on the mailbox. - Anything doin'? - No. No lights, no TV, no noise at all. Unless he's sleeping, I'd say he's out. [Dio] 'Are you telling me you don't have' 'what you're supposed to have by tomorrow?' No, no, that's not what I'm sayin' at all. All I'm sayin' is that for the moment.. ...the money's tied up in somethin'. [Dio] 'Tomorrow is your deadline.' 'I'll be open for business at my hotel suite.' 'You be there after 6:00 PM with the cash.' 'If you're not' 'you'll have visitors.' [receiver clicks] [intense music] ♪ Have you tried ♪ ♪ To laugh away ♪ ♪ Things that cause you pain.. ♪♪♪ [sighs] What's up? You want a drink? Nah. Anybody know you here besides me? No. Why? We got trouble, baby. There's paper on ya. For what? Who put a contract out on me? You know the dago that you offed at the Hollywood Vine Motel? He was connected, man. - Yeah. - Says who? A friend of mine who knows the people. That's bullshit. You and me were the only ones there. No. There was a backup man outside the motel, recognizes you from the joint. This is no lie. [sighs] Do you think these people are for real? I'm talkin' plugged in. - The guy that put the paper.. - Mm-hmm. You know, he's a juice man. Tryin' to make himself look good. Nah. We put him away, that's the end of it. No baby brothers. - And Ronnie's home free. - Hmm. How will you do it? I already talked to him on the phone. The juice man. I told him I wanna talk about it alone. [chuckles] This juice guy's got backup. Yeah. But they always got hard cash layin' around, too. - That's true. - Hey, now, look. There's no other way. Who's this guy? Guy's name is Tony Dio. He's nothin', he's a piece of shit. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, tomorrow he won't even be that. [instrumental music] All good things come to those that wait. Yeah, but no Ronnie. Shit! We can't wait much longer. Tomorrow's our last day, remember? Jimmy, we could take him, squeeze the son of a bitch and hope he hands up Ronnie. No way he will. If he has half a brain, he knows we can't even hold him based on what we got. Then the ballgame's really over. Listen, Sam, um, this guy's probably gonna stay in the rest of the night. I got somethin' I wanna do. You know, if Red meets up with anybody and they split you go with the other one. We know where to find him. Alright, okay. I'll contact you on your radio when I get in the car. I'll be here.

I'm turnin' in my badge. - Just like that? - Yeah, just like that. Soon as I get even for Russo, I'm outta here. Well, what about your kid? Yeah, well, I thought about taking him with me. Matter of fact, I even went over there tonight to ask if I can have him. What'd she say? [sighs] I never asked. Figure he's better off with them and I'm better off alone, you know? That is...unless.. ...unless you wanna come along. Christ, I was willing to settle for just going dancing you remember? So, is that a yes or a no? [sighs] It doesn't work. I tried it. - What doesn't work? - Running away. - We're not running away. - No? What would you call it, a fresh start? Honey, there's no such thing. We are what we are, we gotta do what we gotta do and that baggage travels with you wherever you go. So, I open up a cathouse in Des Moines. Make you a star. How's that? Make it Newark and you gotta deal. I told you, I'm packin' it in. Come on, you know you'll never be happy unless you're crawling through sewers and catching rats. What's the difference where it is? You don't get it, do you? Look, it's already cost me my wife, my kid, and now Russo. That's it. I can't pay anymore. Well, at least...with me it wouldn't have cost you anything. Good luck. [instrumental music] Vikki! Thanks. - Hello.. - Hi, Vikki. Jesus Christ. Do I look that bad? Hell, it's only been 24 hours. The way we're goin', be ready for another 24 hours. [instrumental music] [dogs barking] Guess your old man's back there. [indistinct chattering] Hello, Red. Oh, glad I caught ya. I was just rushin' off for a meeting. - I thought we said that-- - I know, I know. Come on, now. Ahem. Sit down. It's just that I've been thinkin'.. ...this whole week that I haven't seen ya.. You know, about us and everything. We can make it, Mona. I swear, this time it can't miss. If this meeting tonight goes the way I think it will I'll be free as a bird. Red, you're gonna be late. Yeah, Mona.. [inhales] ...I gotta tell ya somethin'. Somethin' that happened to me last night and I don't know how to say it. But, uh.. ...it's somethin' that you gotta know. I'll only know if you tell me. I was with someone last night. A woman? Yeah. But nothin' serious. You know, just, uh.. Well, just someone to, um.. To go to bed with. You know what I'm sayin'. It's just that I'm no good with anyone else. Now, I don't wanna believe that. You know, a man's got to feel that, uh he can do it on his own. But after last night.. ...I know that I can't.. ...that I'm no good without you. You're gonna be late. You already said that. What do you want me to say? [sighs] I want you to say that you'll give me another chance. I'll give you another chance. Well, that's great. Now, you won't be sorry, and that's a promise. - You better go. - Listen, we gotta celebrate. Later, you know, after this meeting. 'Cause we're gonna have a new beginning. And I know how to kick this thing off. Listen, tonight is the last night of dancing at the Palace. We gotta be there. It'll be just like old times. What do ya say, huh? Alright. I'll meet you there after I get off work. I have to do some things and I wanna get dressed. So, where will you be? You just look for the happiest redhead in the whole world.

Yep, briefcase and all. [engine revving] Sawed-off's gotta be in the case, Jimmy. We could bust 'em right now. Not enough. They're in possession, that's enough to put 'em away. Yeah, but it's not enough for Russo. [music continues] [music continues] Something's going down. I know it. Listen, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. We'd better bust 'em now before that freak goes crazy and kills somebody or else you're lookin' for trouble. [intense music] [sighs] You don't want ear plugs, right? What? Ear plugs. Had my ears running for two days when I did that guy in the motel. Shotgun's a loud motherfuckin' piece, man. [music continues] Okay, now. When it's done wipe the shotgun, drop it. Then we're gonna split up, okay? What about the money? No, I'll-I'll take the money. Uh.. I want you to meet me at the Palace now. In one hour, that's 9:00 PM. Then we'll cut up the pie. Drinks are on the red guy. Huh, how's that? You wanna get in on the fun? Huh, no, I don't get in your way, kid. You said they'd be two of 'em. You might need it. Ah, I hope not. [elevator bell rings] US treasury. You seen this guy? Yeah. I checked 'em out. They said they were goin' up to the penthouse. Jimmy, let's go. Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow. - Alright. - Don't say anything. [Red] Kick in the door. Then you do your number. Alright, remember, I'm gonna be right behind you. - You ready? - No, I need this for the money. Remember we're going off the roof, huh? - Yeah. - Okay, kid. Now kick in the door.

Okay, I got the money. Come on, kid, let's go. Let's go! [laughing] Wait, the door's here. Get in there, just get in. [music continues] Check the roof. Here, it's clean. Go. Take the stairs, we'll split this later. - Okay. - Huh? [music continues] [indistinct chatter] - Don't shoot. - 'Out.' - I'm out. I'm out. - 'Out!' Ronnie's gone. He must've taken the other stairway. That's okay. 'Cause Red is going to tell us where he is. Right now, motherfucker. The Palace. That was the plan, meet him at 9 o'clock split the money. But if I'm not there.. ...he's gonna know something's wrong. In that kind of crowd, heh-heh, you're never gonna find him. He's right. We still don't know what the fuckin' guy looks like. [instrumental music] [indistinct chattering] Okay, get up there. Okay, this is Mercer. Friendly's moving into position. [music continues] [music continuous] Suspect is moving up the north staircase. Wearing a yellow sport jacket. 'Sam, don't take him. Wait for back up.' [music continues] - You okay? - Got your piece with you? - What's wrong? - You brought the cops, look. Let's get outta here, baby. You lead the way, okay? - Hmm? - Okay, go! He's got a gun. [gunshot] [gunshots] [dramatic music] [guns click] [indistinct chattering] What's the use?
