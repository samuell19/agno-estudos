Number 14, please come to counter 4. You mean my house will be auctioned off? Yes. Know what that house is? No, sir. It's not just any old house. I saved for 25 years, since I was 20 years old, to… If you can't repay by the 30th, we'll proceed with the auction. Actually… I lent money to my friend. He said he'd pay me back. I could kill that bastard! Sir? I'm sorry. I apologize. Sorry. Did you just curse, sir? No, I didn't mean it. Sorry. Seriously, isn't there a way to resolve this before auctioning it? Isn't this a bit harsh? You should've borrowed what you can afford. Other customers are waiting. Next, please. Number 15, please come to counter 3. Right. I spent too much. I spent money like water. Excuse me, sir. Found a way to help? - Sir. - Yes? Happy birthday. TOOTHPASTE Thanks. Just give me one. Why spend so much? Goodbye. There he is. Where'd you go? When did you start? - Such a handsome man. - Really? So uselessly in the country. Whatever. Snap out of it. Your debt is a headache, but you gotta work. Forget it. Does anyone need this? Take it. Toothpaste? I got it as a gift. You'll catch him someday. I heard the inspection team will come this month. What? Why? The bastard must've told his lawyer that we took bribes. Can't you clear that shit, Chief? Ungrateful jerk. Did I take them all? I shared them with the team. Really? Then what? Chief. You know I took it just once for my loan payment. I'm not like this rotten snake. What? You want me to take the fall? Why, you... Hey! It's not for sure yet. Let's not worry now. Chief Kang, did you hear? Ki-hyeong said he went and saw Yong-bae in the Philippines. Yong-bae? That damn con artist? Is he sure? Where in the Philippines? He wasn't sure. He passed him in a car. They all run to the Philippines. Damn. Oh my. Byeong-su… Oh no… It's all rusted. I should paint it again. A voice phishing call to a cop? I'm a detective. Byeong-su? It's me. ♪ Happy birthday, dear Byeong-su ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - What the heck? - Did you eat cake? I almost forgot because you go by the lunar calendar. Cut the crap. Who's congratulating me on my birthday? It's Yong-bae, buddy. Doing well? Thanks to you. I'm looking at my precious house that you made me lose. How's Ji-yun? Is she going to school now? Is your wife healthy? Of course. She exercises hard day and night. She says she'll kill you when you're caught. Hey, pal. I found it. I know you're in the Philippines. Word travels fast. We're rich, man. - What? Let go! - You can't fool me. Cut the act! Where are you? I'll find you. Hello? That son of a bitch. Trying to con me on my birthday? Million? Why are you out in the cold? Go. Go! Go home! - Ta-da! - Dad! It's cold. Shut it. Oh my. I'm hungry. Anything to eat? Like cake, maybe? You don't like cake. No chocolate cake? How would I know? I told you to come home early. Don't rip that! The month isn't over! Who cares? January comes around every year! ANNIVERSARY It's our anniversary. Let's just eat noodles at the Chinese restaurant. What's the big fuss? I know you're ten. Third grade at Daecheon Elementary. What? What? Tenth anniversary. Then we'll order some more dishes this time. I'm sick of noodles. Stop and ask anyone. Ask who hasn't been on a trip abroad. No. Forget going abroad. I haven't even been to Jeju Island! Mimi's mom from next door bragged about going to Waikiki! Why did I trust you and have her at 20? I'm the crazy bitch! I must be crazy! I'm crazy! There's a beach here in Daecheon. It's not Waikiki! I'm not asking to go that far! Why can't I travel abroad? Mom doesn't even pee in that direction. You didn't know? It's where you two first met! Fine. Let's go. To Jeju Island. It's too cold to go there in the winter! One week in the Philippines for 399,000 won. It's a bargain sale. What's with you people and going to the Philippines? - Why? Who else is going? - Forget it. It's less than 1.5 million won for the three of us. Don't say 1.5 million easily like it's a dog's name. The name of the pub's dog is Million. - It died. - It's dead? Yes! Just eat noodles and die! If we won't go to the Philippines, let's just die! Million is dead? - Oh my. - I'll just die! I can't even go the Philippines… Oh no. You really want to go? Yes. We do. How many times must we say it? You really want to go? Let's go. Please? Just once, Daddy? Jeez… DETECTIVE TEAM 3 GO? DON'T GO? Going on vacation? Where did you hear that crap? What crap? Your wife called. You're going to the Philippines? That damn woman. DETECTIVE AHN, DETECTIVE HONG Here. It's not much. Take it. What's this? Give it to him nicely! What? - Why did you hit me? - It's your tenth anniversary, right? Yes. We pitched in for your trip. It's so unexpected. You missed your honeymoon to catch criminals. Go abroad and eat good food like big crabs. Who knows? You could get lucky and catch Yong-bae. - Yong-bae? - Hey. Just keep your eyes wide open. Will I shit blood after taking this? Forget it if you don't want it. How much did you pay? I'm kidding. Thanks a lot. Man, I'm so hungover. Hong Byeong-su! - Let's go, Hong Byeong-su! - Let's go, Hong Byeong-su! Let's go, Hong Byeong-su! Yes, like that! Hong Byeong-su! - That bastard! - He cheated! That's cheating! - He cheated! - Look! Yong-bae. Yong-bae! No! - What? - How do I look? You win. Let's go. Why, you… - Finally! - Hey! Why did you dress her up like that? Oh my… MANILA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT Mrs. Hong? The bus is over there. - Hello! - Hi! See you later. Wait. Dad! Hurry up! Okay! Wait up! Hello. I'll be your guide here in Manila. I'm Park Min-seok. How about a big hand? Stand close together, please. One, two, three! Ready? THE PHILIPPINES AT LAST! One, two, three! - Jump up. - Look over here. Jump! - It's hot. - You call this a picture? Look at that. Like this one? It's so hot. This is nuts. No smoking, okay? I can't even smoke here. Jeez. Just keep going straight this way. Jeez. Bathroom break, folks. Working hard? Where are you going to eat? - I'm eating at the Korean diner. - Seoul House? - How's it going? - Well… - How about a drink? - Dad. What? Nothing. - Dad. - What? - Know him? - No. - It's 50% off. - Mister. Gotta go. Mister! - Ji-yun! Go to the hotel! - Dad! Where are you going? Honey! Stop! - Hwang Man-cheol! - You got the wrong guy! That jerk! You bastard. Hwang Man-cheol! Hey. Wait… Why am I running away? What? This is the Philippines! So? I have no reason to run. Shit. You're no INTERPOL! Put it down. I'm a boxer. Stay back! Remember? I used to box, pal. You bastard! Man-cheol. I said I'm a boxer. Shit. The Philippines. Your mom got so old from all the stress you gave her! Why bring up my mom? How could you con folks with rice? And rice harvested by old ladies who worked themselves to the bone at that. It's a misunderstanding. If my mom and your mom weren't friends, you'd be dead! Have you seen Yong-bae around? I heard someone saw him here in the Philippines. - You didn't know? - What? Yong-bae is in prison. What? You really didn't know? He killed a man. What? PRISON OUTSIDE MANILA Kim Yong-bae, you bastard! Why, you… The color suits you. Really? Orange suits me because my skin is dark. Whatever. You even killed a man? You're total trash. Don't you believe me? I trust dogs more than you. I've been framed. I'll get out soon. Framed? You took all my money and ran away to the Philippines. Of course you've been framed. You should've kept better relationships. Hey. Got a smoke on you? Not for you. What brings you here? He's on a top-secret case. Why, you… He's on vacation here for his tenth anniversary. Right? Really? Already? Time flies fast. Damn right. I've been paying the interest on the money you took for five years. When will you pay me back? Byeong-su. Can you find someone for me? Not again. You know Park Chun-sik? The actor who grew up in a nearby town. Give me my money! The guy who played Bok-dol in Three Families? That's right! The child actor. He goes by Charlie Park here. He was with me that night. This is your car, right? He's my only witness. But he vanished. See? You kept shitty relationships! Jeez. Come here. Shit… Come here, Byeong-su. Oh my… It's the Philippines. Just speak Korean. No one will know! I found it. You remember, right? Yamashita's Gold. It's here. During World War II, a general went to 12 Asian countries and took all the treasures he could get. His name was Yamashita. So that's why it's called Yamashita's Gold? So no one would take it, he set up bombs and hid the treasure. Know how much it's worth? How much? Ten quadrillion won. Is that a lot? You idiot. One quadrillion is a thousand trillion. You need to study, Man-cheol. What will you be when you grow up? Don't pick on just me! Byeong-su is no better than me! Why, you… Byeong-su will go to the Olympics as a boxer. He's not like you. Anyway, I'm going to save up and find the treasure. When I do, I'll give you 30%, Byeong-su. It's okay. It's to thank you for saving my life, pal. If we don't find Bok-dol, what happens to Yong-bae? - Execution. - What? Or life, if he's lucky. Oh my. Damn it. What? Nothing. What? Enjoy your stay here. Come here at 9:00 a.m. I have my business, sir. Why, you little… I could arrest you and take you back, you know. This isn't Daecheon. It's the Philippines. You can't arrest me. Take some mangoes instead. See you. Bye. He's a thief, not a detective. Jeez. What if we get lost here? We can't speak English. I can't either. I don't believe this. What's wrong, Dad? What is it? Gather around. This really sucks. - What? - It's a family trip. We should tour around the Philippines together. But I got a call earlier. From INTERPOL. Where? International police? That's right. - Why did they call? - How did they know I was here? They said to catch a Korean drug lord here. That's crazy. Are they nuts? Why would they ask you to catch him? That's what I said. Why me? But they said it's best because the drug lord doesn't know me. I said no, but they shoved money in my bag. - It's an investigation fund. See? - Something's fishy. You can't speak English. What international investigation? I got this from the government. Go eat and shop with that. I'll meet you at the airport on Saturday. What's "Saturday" in English? Look at all this money. Don't stare at me like that. Think about it, Byeong-su. What's 30% of 50 billion won? It's 15 billion won. If we find it, it's yours. A 30-year-long friendship… - Dad? - Oh jeez. You came here to work, didn't you? Sleep. Let's just sleep. Okay. Think you can snatch all the gold I searched for for 20 years? What do you mean? You killed Jun, right? He was my friend. Patrick. Kill him. You understand Korean, right? Just listen. Go on. Kill him. He's saying his last prayers. I need help from the police. Get what I mean? Good. It's Charlie Park. Park Chun-sik. - I changed my mind. - Mr. Actor. Still in the Philippines? Yes. Not going to Korea? I will once I get the wire. Send me 200,000 dollars more. Ji-yun! I'll see you on Saturday. Smile. - Bye! - Let's go. Have fun and eat lots, Ji-yun! Dang. Let's get started. Give me my wallet! What wallet? - You took it yesterday! - Right. You're a thief. Don't look inside my wallet. Is he your son? You've only been here for five years. How do you have a son? Of course he's my son. He doesn't look like he's got a drop of Korean blood in him. - Man. - Get out. What? No way, man. I'm a boxer, remember? Let's go. Where to? Where are we going? You have to tell me where to go. Stop asking! I'm thinking! - Jeez. - My goodness. What is there to think about? Where else would gamblers go? They gamble and fool around with girls. Isn't it obvious? Why aren't you looking for him? Shouldn't we go? He's not here. We have to stake the place out for a while. It's a given. How can you investigate if you don't know that? Why, you little… Get up! Fine. Take this and try it. The closest to nine wins. You got it! - Nine. - Nine. - Nine. - Yeah. Oh my. - Let's go now! - We're not going anywhere yet! Here. Wait. Here. - Nine! - Nine! Nine! Nine! Nine! - You sure? - Park Chun-sik is a regular here. - Hwang Man-cheol. - Yeah? Why, you… You're enjoying heaven here. Yes! Who's this? She said she saw Charlie Park. - Really? - Let me introduce you two. - Michael? - Michael. You need an English name here. I go by Trump. What? She says her name is Stella and that you're handsome. Why are you looking for Charlie? You don't need to know that. It's nothing. Stella! I drank too much. - Philippines! - Philippines! Jeez. You know how to drink, sir. Stella! Cheers! I have to find Park Chun-sik… What's 30% of 50 billion won? It's 15 billion won. If we find it, it's yours. Yong-bae! Yong-bae! No! Ow, my head. My bag. My passport. That son of a bitch. Byeong-su, just tour around and go back quietly. I'm warning you, fool. This is the Philippines. - If you act up here, you'll die. - That bastard. Yours truly, Man-cheol. PS. Watch out for cars and pickpockets. Stay alert. Leave me out this time. Buy drinks then. It's Byeong-su. - See? - What? Did he catch on? Don't answer it. It's long distance. Shit. Chief? Gotta go. Hi, Mr. Nam! Why are you calling from abroad? No one on my team is answering the phone. Didn't they tell you? Tell me what? Things were crazy because the inspection team came. They said you'd take all the blame. They said you took the most bribes. Anyway, I'm busy. - Have fun! - Damn bastards. Hello? Mr. Nam? That's why. Those damn bastards… Where's my bag? My bag! My suitcase! Where's my suitcase? Where's my phone? Cell phone? Cell phone. Where's my phone? Mango… My mango! Mango. Why is the Korean embassy closed on a holiday here? On holidays in both countries and on the weekends! "Come back tomorrow"? I've heard that a dozen times! I'm a cop too. I have no money or passport. I lost my wallet… Help me! - The embassy is closed today. - Help me! They're not cops! - I'm a cop. - Help me! I'm the actor Park Chun-sik! I'm the actor Park Chun-sik! - Help me! - Park Chun-sik? - Did you say Park Chun-sik? - Help me! Taxi! Taxi! Bastard! Stay still! Is he in here? What do I do? - You can't come in here! - Wait! Pee! I need exercise. Should've taken one punch. I don't know. I swear! Where is Yamashita's Gold? I don't know! Boss! There he is. Boss! Chun-sik! Run! You bastards! You're lucky I didn't get firearms training! Shit! Damn it. I'm already out of bullets? Chun-sik! What the hell? - Chun-sik! - Don't follow me! It's me! - What the hell? - Chun-sik! - It's me! - Who are you? - Run! - Who are you? Who are you? Yong-bae worked his brain like hell to take it all with Jun. I see. But… Police? I'd like to make a report. I saw someone getting killed. We're rich. Only two people know where the gold is. One got killed. The only one left is Yong-bae. Why can't Patrick find it himself? Do you know how many islands there are here? - Nope. - There are 7,107 officially known ones. And it's buried in the sea. He can't find it. After all that, why isn't Yong-bae spilling? So he can survive. As soon as he does, he knows he's dead. Anyway, let's go to the embassy at daybreak. You want to die together? No way. I'm not going anywhere without protection from INTERPOL. Damn. It's all because of Yong-bae, that bastard. You have to go and testify so Yong-bae can clear his name. How much will you pay me? What? Wait. Don't open the door. What the hell? Me? Michael? Stella! Right. Why did you call her? She doesn't understand Korean. We have to know who's after me to run or testify. Why, you little… Sir. So, you want to hand him over for money? Yup. I'll take him to Patrick. Once I get the money, we'll leave the country. Okay? What are you talking about? Patrick's men are everywhere. We have to lie low here for a bit. I asked her to hook me up with someone higher up. That's not a good idea. Where are you going? Bathroom. What did she say? She has to pee. You trust me, right? Yup. What the heck do I do? PATRICK, YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES OR THERE'S NO DEAL - Give it back! - Hold on. What's this? I'm texting a friend to say I'm leaving for Korea. - Really? - Yes. Don't trust anyone. You'll get in trouble. Right. 200,000 PESOS DEPOSITED TO PHILIPPINES ISLAND BANK I'm a cop from Korea! There must be a misunderstanding. Please. I'm just a normal tourist visiting the Philippines. I don't really know him. You're Yong-bae's friend. Yeong-bae? Never heard of him. I have a friend named Yeong-cheol who raises pigs back home. Two years ago, he said he'd die with his pigs during the foot-and-mouth outbreak. You son of a bitch! Listen. I'm a cop! Sergeant Hong Byeong-su of the Daecheon Police! I'm not someone to be messed with by you bastards. What? Really? You're a real cop? Yes. So untie me now. So, if I untie you, I'll be okay? If you untie me, I'll forget everything that happened. I'll just go back to Korea quietly. What the hell? Hello? Patrick! Hello? - Hey! - Hi, Yong-bae. What will it be? - If I spill, you'll stop? - Of course. If you give me the key, your friend will go to Korea. Do you have to do this? Aren't you close with him? Scared, huh? Yong-bae, you bastard! You bastard! Cut the crap and put my friend on. - Byeong-su! You hear me? - You made me go broke in Korea! And you ruin me here too? Yong-bae! Listen carefully, pal. When we were kids, you burned beans to eat in our field. I warned you to stop! But you ended up burning your family's grave site! Then what did you say to me? That if your dad caught you, you'd die! Then you framed it on me! - Heard that? What a bad friend. - I got beaten up by your older brother for that! Be a man! How could you… Shut him up, will you? Fine! Don't touch a hair on him! - Come here! - Open up! What will it be? Send him to the embassy now. If I do and you bail out? Damn. It's your choice. Then you'll never find it. So think it over and call me back. Have you arrived? Put my friend on. Byeong-su. Listen carefully. The bastard will send you to the Korean embassy. Get on the first plane out of here. You hear me? Byeong-su? - You son of a bitch! - Don't think of anything else. Don't do anything. Are you listening? Byeong-su. Go home. - You bastard! - I'm sorry. I tried to do good. Believe me. You bastard! Give him what he wants! Where is the key? So many rich people, huh? What? I thought it wasn't going to fit. Excuse me. Yong-bae! It also needs a code! Oops! I forgot about that. I'm getting old. What's the code? You made a big mistake! Everyone makes mistakes. But, you know, if I get some fresh air, it could come to me. - Just letting you know. - Kim Yong-bae! That damn son of a bitch! Call Sean now! KOREAN EMBASSY IN THE PHILIPPINES What happened, sir? Were you robbed? If you don't tell us, we can't help you. - Where's the ambulance? - I'll check. It's so he can survive. As soon as he talks, he knows he's dead. Sir? Dad hasn't called once. Should we call him? Forget it. He must be busy with the case. Sawasdee ka. Hey! You can speak Filipino? Wow! This way, please. It took me all day to find you. Where's Hwang Man-cheol? I knew it! - Hong Byeong-su, damn it! - Dad! Look at all the sweat on you, Son. I told you to study hard. Dad? Your friend is here. Your dad doesn't have friends. Bye! Have fun, sir. You raised your son well. He speaks Korean well. Man-cheol. Yes? Get in. Yes. Sir? I could die. Really? My mistake. I made a big mistake in front of our dear Man-cheol. - I'm sorry I made a mistake, pal. - Gosh… How could you do that? Sir? It's a misunderstanding. - Really? - Yes. I'm the stupid one! Sir? You're on TV. - What the heck? - You're… You're a wanted killer. - Cut the crap! - Look! See? You're on TV as Park Chun-sik's killer! The prime suspect is a Korean man who was with Park in a hotel. He arrived here recently - on vacation with his family. - What? Officials were shocked to learn that he is a police detective in Korea. - How do I look? - Great! Make sure you get the sea. Jeez! Stop texting me, people! Ji-yun? Text them back. Tell them we're vacationing in the Philippines. Oops! Mom? Dad… What about him? It says Dad killed someone! What? It's a classic set-up job. - A set-up? - You got pulled into it. With no firm evidence to clear you, you'll rot in prison for life. He bought it. Money can buy anything. It works, right? Don't flaunt having a gun! Know how to shoot? They're all the same. I'm a cop, man. Good for you. Good for you too. It hurts! Let's go. - Wait. - Why? It's dangerous with just us, so I got some bodyguards. - Really? - What's taking them so long? There they are! What the heck? Some bodyguards! They're tambay and scarier than they look. You call that scary? Trust me. Where to? Where do you think? The crime scene, of course. The first step in an investigation. Let's go! They call that preserving a scene? People are walking in and out. What can you tell by looking inside? The answer is always at the crime scene. Does he think he's FBI? When the police come, call me. Watch it! Man-cheol! Stop! It's dried up. What can you tell? Cut it out. Be honest. You've never seen a murder scene, right? First time? How could there be no witnesses? They must've heard gunshots. Sir. Let me explain. Folks here don't interfere in other people's business. There are no witnesses in murder cases here! Can't you say hopeful things? It's the Philippines. Jeez. - Why, you little… - What? - Jeez. - Why are you hitting me? - I just explained what happen here! - Let me run my business. - I mean... - Quiet! I'll see, then decide. They're coming in! I think it'll take some time. Jeez! That should be enough! Please go, so I can clean. What? Did you hear that? What now? I have to open the hotel! If you can't, give me my money. Okay, we'll go. Why weren't you watching? We almost died! - Almost died! You know? - I'm hungry. Let's go. Okay. I said call me before people come in. But you called me after they came in! They just eat and do nothing! Why'd you bring them? Aren't we eating too? Go buy a bottle of water. He's got hands and feet! Police. He's from INTERPOL. He's looking for a criminal. Let us see. See? - It's like this here. - Damn it! Know how many bums are in Cavite Village? How would I know? Know how many bums are in Cavite Village? Over 600. More than 1,000 if we bring in another village. So what? Over 600. More than 1,000 if we bring in another village. Get lost. Scram! We're skin and bones. We can last ten days on a bottle of water and a mango. - That's scary? - Sorry. What if over 600 bums come, stay outside the store, and beg for ten days? Your boss will lose business. Then you'll lose your job. If you lose your job, your kids will end up on the streets. Then they'll become bums like us. What's this? My dentures! You don't have teeth? Why, you! What are those men called? - Tambay. - Tambay? What did they say? I'll tell you later. Focus! Missed it. Go back. - Hey! - What? Found it. - What? - We found him! I'll get you. That's it. It's that car. Sir? Think it over. If you act up, you could die. I have to pay him back. You should plan things through. Give it some thought, you know? Or just go to the cops. Stop! You picked the wrong man. If I die, Yong-bae dies. You okay with that? You dare mess with a cop? Know why people live unhappily? Easy. It's because they waste time believing in something worthless. Stuff like true friendships or love. Think that exists? It's so shallow and superficial. What the hell are you talking about? Think Yong-bae sincerely tried to save you? You really think so? If that were the case, he would've given me the key and the secret code too. Then you wouldn't have been framed as a killer. What the hell? Yong-bae once said that if he claimed the earth is square, a friend in Korea would believe that. Damn criminals! They all talk too much! Damn it! Oh no. The gun is 200 dollars, but bullets cost 500 dollars? Buying or not? Okay. Give it to me. Just the gun. There's one bullet in there. One bullet inside? Okay. Hey! Get down. Man-cheol, that idiot. Who are you? You can't kill people, can you? You little twerp! I didn't think you'd use it. What? I told you they're damn scary. It's all on here! My name will be cleared. But it's game over for you. Hey, country boy. Know where this is? Stop. Don't say it. It's the Philippines. Say, "Ah." Why? Eye for an eye? I'm a boxer. How much longer do I have to wait? Mister! - Jeez! - You scared me. I waited hours for them to look for a few minutes on the damn USB! When will you uncuff me? Things are slow here. Please wait. I'll handle it. Ask her when they'll uncuff me. Come on! Jeez. Uncuff me now. Uncuff me, please. Why are so many bastards pointing a gun at me today? Wanna shoot me? Damn. They're all crazy about money. Man… There's nothing on the USB. Finally, they're here. Take the cuffs off. She says there's nothing on the USB. - That's not true! - What happened? Arrest him! Take him away! What? You're with him, aren't you? This is a set-up! What? Money does all the talking. Get it now? You bastard. I'll kill you no matter what. I'll kill you! Let's talk. Byeong-su. We need to talk, Byeong-su. Don't say my name. I don't want to hear it from you. And I won't be calling you ever again. If you had left, this wouldn't have happened. Why stick around and cause trouble? Thanks a lot, bastard. Did you do it because of me? Wasn't it for the gold? Why, you! Byeong-su. Think I would've given you 30%? Think I'm nuts? For what? You wanted the damn money. You pulled all that shit for that? You bastard! Shit. Hi, Yong-bae. It's 1201, right? I knew it. It's so complex. Where is it? You son of a bitch. Damn clever. Now, what do you want? Open the gate! Dad! - Ji-yun! Baby girl! - Dad! Why are you here? - Are you hurt? - I'm fine. Dad! Let's go! When we get back home, you're dead. Does it hurt? Did you have fun? I guess. I should've come with you. Why, you! Man-cheol! Tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. Thanks. Why would you carry money in this? That's weird. Here. What? I haven't seen this in years! I look better with a slimmer face, huh? WANTED CRIMINALS Wait. Isn't he that bastard? What? - Who? - Hold on. - Look. - It looks like Patrick. Maybe not. WANTED FOR MURDER SON BONG-GU What happened? Things are crazy here! What else? I've been framed. I'm not going till I catch the real culprit. Byeong-su. Turn yourself in. What the hell? - No way. - Wait. Are you in prison? No. Check for Son Bong-gu on the wanted poster. He died a few days before you left. - We found his bones. Remember? - Forget that. - We're waiting for the DNA test. - Forget it! Hello? Byeong-su! You're the real winner today. No matter what, you deserved the gold medal! Crazy fool. I had to forfeit because of you. Jeez. Is that important? Just forget it. DAECHEON HONG BYEONG-SU What are you doing? My baby girl! Look at the stars. How many are there? One, two, three, four… Five! Five? That many? I want to ask you something. What? Do you know when my birthday is? Nope. It moves around every year. My only daughter doesn't know? Do you know my birthday? Weren't you born in April or May? You don't know either! Jeez. But I have a friend who always calls on my birthday. So? We fought. Really? Then apologize to him first. Friends shouldn't fight. But it's his fault. Still want me to apologize? Good grief. You're a good man. Apologize to him first. Good folks apologize first? Right. Then I should do as you say and apologize first. You were born on April 6th on a Saturday. Think I don't know? Right. I'll do as you said. Tell me the truth. Is it the gold or friendship? It's a friendship like gold, man! Whoa… - Stop! - Okay! It has to be him. A butterfly tattoo on his butt… I just need to check that. A butterfly tattoo… KOREAN-STYLE SAUNA WITH PROFESSIONAL SCRUBBERS A sauna? Jeez! Stupid. Damn it! - Boss! - Hey! - Damn bastards! - Forget it! Are you okay, sir? That's it. - Don't make a fuss and bring me a suit. - Yes, sir. - Sean? - Why? It's your last job. Tomorrow afternoon… at 5:00 p.m., we'll sail out. Bring Yong-bae out, okay? Here. Start. So many… What are you doing? Yes. Look lower. Sorry. It's not here. The butt. - A butterfly… - Hey. Yes?

Stop right there! - Hello. - Where did they go? - Get Yong-bae out now. - What? Bring him out now! - You plucked out so many! My goodness. - Sir? What? I don't know if this matters. - Know what Bong-gu said? - What? He said he'll take Yong-bae out of prison tomorrow night. Why didn't you say that earlier? At least I said it now! Why, you little… I think they'll take him out to find the gold tomorrow. - Then we gotta go first. - What? Turn around. Turn around now! - Hurry! - I am! - Floor it! - I am! - Is the Korean gone? - Yes, sir. What the… One… It's here! - Over there! - Okay! Where is it? Over there. Over where? It's here. Tell them to come around that way. Come around that way. - Go down. - I'm going! What's going on? Bring him up! Cut the act, you asshole. Hey. Know why it's called Yamashita's Gold? Cuff him. Okay! It happened in June 1945. The Americans blocked off the seaways to the Japanese. Then what? You have to hide it, of course. The general in charge was… Yamashita. But that bastard… didn't want it taken… and set up explosives. IMPERIAL JAPANESE ARMY You bastard! Clever thinking. There's no such thing as Yamashita's Gold. Then I have no use for you. No! It exists! The gold exists! Wait! Yong-bae! Are you okay, pal? - Byeong-su! - The cops will come soon. - Don't worry. - Did you come alone? I came too! We came together! Are you nuts? - Use your head, Byeong-su! - Wait. You know the scary tambay? We came with them too. They're not here yet. What? Why not? You told them to go around. That way. Kill them. What? Freeze! Don't move! Freeze! - Isn't that gold? - What? Gold! Yong-bae! I'll kill you, bastard! Your friend will die. He got shot. Not going to save him? Sir! Byeong-su! Come on! Save him! How annoying! That idiot! You're not getting away! Damn! That bastard! He's hit. Byeong-su! Sir! I'm slipping away. Really? Are we going to die like this? Yong-bae! Yong-bae! Yong-bae! No! Yong-bae! Wake up! Yong-bae! You're alive! I thought you died! Byeong-su! What is it? It hurts. Where? Where does it hurt? Sit up. - My shoulder! I think I got shot. - Where? - Man-cheol. - Yes? What happened to Bong-gu? Who am I? He's over there. - Where? - Uncuff me! My arms hurt! STUPID What the hell? Damn bastards! Stop being a baby! Hey! I'll get you next time. Go ahead and try. Don't drain your energy being investigated here. You'll be investigated like hell back in Korea, Bong-gu. Bong-gu! Greedy Bong-gu! Try to work hard for a living next time! Give me some water. Police! Wait. By the way… What? It doesn't exist? What? Spill it. How may I help you? It's been a while. Open it. It's 1201. My birthday. I go by the lunar calendar. TOOTHPASTE I hate being indebted to anyone. I spent appropriately. Use it for the year. SIX BILLION WON I came to pay off all my debt. What would you like to do with the remaining balance? May I suggest a high-interest savings account? The change? I want it in cash right now. Why are you doing this to me? I want new bills. Subtitle translation by Esther Kwon
