Peek-a-boo, a diving club. Peek-a-boo. I'm Shinji Tokita. Kotobuki Ryuujirou. And, the members. Stop it! We're here at Toshio-san's store to help him and do our club activity. Nanaka-san as an Instructor and Chisa as a club member. Why did it take until 2 weeks to tell us. Why have we lost our memories? You two just unfortunate to meet us. Welcome~ Why isn't there a club with a group of high school girls! For what I'm coming here! There it is. You two joined us.. basically, you're a club member. And that's how happen, we carried you to the University, Why being naked?! Hey, newbie! The student's job is to learn! Need to go to class! Don't forget it! I never get lectured like this! One more thing! Don't forget about this! Nanaka good at Judo- and siscon. Chisa-san~ If you make any move on Chisa, you'll be put in that locker. Said it earlier! Get locked there. It's really dark and cramped. It's truly scary. Imamura Kouhei. Kitahara Iori. Welcome to Peek-a-Boo. Impossible! It's useless! Kitahara! Damn you! No place to go! No clothe to wear! Did you join, Peek-a-Boo. No! I'll not join! I see. What's wrong? It's nice to have a junior in the club. Why am I need to join? It's all on your face. Any plan on doing diving? About that, ah... Ah, want to do it? I can't swim. You're bad at Japanese, right? I asked if you want to "do" it, but you answered whether you "can". If you only stick with what you already know, you'll never get anywhere. The important is... whether you're interested or not. Please don't be stubborn. Such a simpletic senior, right. Are you okay? Water? Thanks. Hey, what's wrong? How it can light fire on it? It's sake, right? You just have to drink it. What does all this mean, hey! Iori Kitahara! I'll make you drunk! I won't fail to do it! Such a nasty idea for sacrificing someone else! I'll make you drunk too! Kouhei Imamura! And here... Peek-a-Boo staring contest. The rules are simple. Whoever sprays their drink first loses. Be ready, Kouhei Imamura! Start! I used to be an otaku. You lose, Iori! It's good that both of them are so open with each other, right, Chisa-chan? Stupid! Mother! Iori~ I think we're on the same page. It's the worst thing. This is not the university life I dreamed of. You know? Apparently it's May now. I've never been to college with my clothes on. Even my own lodgings are a bit fuzzy. Can you see it, now we have to get out of this island. There's an event over there for Nanako's CV, Mizuki Kayano. It sounds something important right now. Please. No! Please! No! Huh, why? Don't tell me... Hey! Senpai! Everyone here on this island is Peek-a-Boo's member. Hey! Stop! Save us! What's this? It's all the equipment you'll need to dive. Borrowed from Toshio-san. Today, we'll use this to practice at sea. This weird?! Just like a real diving club. Hey, did your head hit somewhere? Refrain yourself from over drinking. Okay, let's go! But, I can't swim... Don't worry, it's okay! Let's go. Not going to take in? Working right now. Hey, Iori. Do you excited to start a university life? Speaking of which... I'm excited about it. If so, I'm sure you'll enjoy this. Eh? Take care. I'll go with Kouhei. So, I'll go with Iori. Okay, let's go. Already? Take care. It's not scary if your feet hit the ground? Yes. You'll simulate what it's like to breathe underwater Okay. This regulator and then breath using this. It feels different. Just like need a force to breath in. Try it underwater. Breathe in deeply and slowly and never stop. Got it? Yes. Good, so let's try it. I'm out of breath! Then, for what that tank on your back? Because I'm scared of breathing underwater. Sorry. No need to feel sorry, Even I get scared when I think about what would happen if I run ou of air. This is called as octopus. You give it to your buddy if they run out of air. Like this. How is it? The weight belt always faces the same way, it's so you can remove it quickly if something happens. The others equipment also like that. It's not only for your own safety, but for your diving friends too. We did a thorough safety check. The weather is perfect. Weather like this one are been advised by the fisherman. Fisherman? It's important to ask fisherman about sea. Trust me. Your fist. Your fist. Auch... My head is getting fuzzy. Here I go! Chisa! Chisa! It's amazing! What happen? It's amazing to be able to breathe underwater, even I can't swim at all. I'm really excited about this! Iori! Go change first. I'm not scared anymore! It's really amazing! Yeah, it's truly... such a new world. Yeah. If only I could learn to dive deeper... I thought about it. It's a new world beyond the thought. I've been thinking about it too hard. It's embarrassing, but... Let's give it a try. Yeah. Our seriousness. Over drink yesterday. Let stay in bed a bit longer. So, let's eat. Thanks for the food. Who's it? Who's she? Ah, she's our member from Oumi Women's University, Azusa Hamaoka. Why is she sleeping here? Maybe because there was a futon. Good morning. Good morning. Iori-kun, right? Just like I heard from Nanaka. Huh? That you're okay with a man too. Let me go! We're back! It's not like that. Don't worry. I'm okay with both too. Huh?! With him, right? I'm over drink again. Like handsome man, huh? No! It's nice to meet someone who's into the same stuff. Let's talk someday, okay? No! It's not like that! Hold on! Chisa! Nanaka! You're cute today. Siscon. Bisex.

I've still struggling while other's still diving, I've been a burden to them. You don't have a good eyes on others, right? Huh? You thought they'll think like that. I'll vouch them that they're not like that. Okay. Hey! What did you two do?! They're calling! Let's go! At this rate, you're the only one who's going to fail. Bad! Bad! Bad! I'm going to be the only one left behind. Good bye! I'm going to let that happen! There's no other way around... There's a way! There's a way! Iori would fail. Why did laugh like that back then?

Are you sure you're okay with me? You're the only one. What's wrong, Cakey? That screaming is from your heart. I don't want to talk about it. What's happen with you? If you don't have any weights, you'll float. It'll be hard to practice. Then we can just put heavy things on me. Can you tie me up? Is he have awakening the sexual fetish? What'll you do? That's kind of dangerous. Yeah, from the beginning it was. If so, at least... step on me with all your strength! Okay. I'de never imagined he'd awaken... Damn you! Love. Be harsh, okay! I'm ready. Where are they going? You're going to wet. Okay. I'll take off my clothes. What are you doing? What are you doing?! Cakey! What are you doing?! There's a stone just dropped into the pool. There's no one going to take out a stone in pool during night time! Tell me the truth! Practicing diving. Why won't you tell me the truth! He's telling the truth. But it's clearly that's something suspicious here! This is just the beginning. Huh, what? There's more to come. This still nothing. Still nothing? Practicing mask clearing. Yeah. I'll be laughing stock if I can't do it, right. I won't. More important, I just wanted to see that new world. So I'll do my best. Let's do it again. Do it better! There's two girls are drowning a man in a pool. We got the license! Bravo! I've never thought that I'll get diving license. Me too. But I can't remember the last time I was this desperate. Don't underestimate a young man who has found his goal. That's right. A normal campus life just like a dream now... Ah, on the other way... this one like a dream. Food's ready! Eat! Tomorrow... let's go, just the two of us. Let's go! Good bye to this island! Good bye to this life too! If only I could learn to dive deeper... I thought about it. It's a new world beyond the thought. I've been thinking about it too hard. Can we run from it with diving? I'll get out from here! Let's try? Our seriousness. No! I'm serious about diving and want to see more about that new world. World where there's no naked men. I'll do my best. So I can get out from here. A normal campus life just like a dream now... Ah, on the other way... this one like a dream. But the worst one. That's right. Our stuff?! Already been sent. About them? Still sleeping. Perfect! Nasty, right? Yeah, you too... It sounds like a compliment. Is the tide flowing well? Yeah, there's no worries at this time. If it's about sea, just ask to the fisherman. It's fun to be with everyone at Peek-a-Boo. Thank you, Chisa! I really love diving! But I much more like Nanako-tan. Yeah, me too. I want to go to campus wearing clothes. Thanks everyone! I love you all! Come visit later to the new world! Chi!
