And they give great tips. Thank God for all-night diners. I tip well, too, baby! Oh, I know you're upset about losing the firm. It's been a rough six months, you know? But if you don't like me working these, uh, shifts, maybe you should consider going back to work. You know, they're looking for a general manager. A discredited shark intruding on a greasy spoon? Talk about a double-sided coin. Well, with your skill set, uhh, you would be a great conductor. And you are no intruder. All the expertise that you would bring. And we need two incomes. So, umm, I'll see you in the morning. And there's sweet rolls in the fridge for you and the kids. Good night. Oh. And lock the door. Hmm.

Time's up! ISAAC: Give me five more minutes. Ugh. We had a deal, Perry Mason. How long does it take to shave a face? I got some legs that need some TLC, tonight. Another date, Em? Another interview, Mr. Unemployed? Hey. Easy on the cross examination. I am the lawyer in the family. Well that's nice. But you're still unemployed. Five more minutes. And don't cut your face up, bro'. [SOUND OF METAL CLATTER] What is that? It was my doorknob. First the bathroom, then the back door and now this. I'm looking for a handyman. How'd it go? Really well. I think. I'm following up next week. Good! [SLAMMING SOUND] Emily, a handyman is going to cost us a fortune. Even if I get this job, I won't be seeing any money until next month. I had a feeling you'd say that. We could rent out Mom and Dad's old room. I thought we decided that wasn't a good idea. Mom and Dad are at the old folks home. Retirement community. Okay. Yeah. Whatever. Look, they gave us this home. We can do whatever we want! Look. I do well managing the sleep disorder center. But my salary alone? I can't afford the upgrades here. And your unemployment checks aren't going to come in forever. I know. Okay. So, how do we find a tenant? What? What did you do? [PLAYFUL AMBIENT MUSIC] I may have already listed it on Craig's List. - Look what I got. - Well, it doesn't surprise me. Well I wasn't going to let you plea bargain me out of another brilliant suggestion. What do you think? Mmm. I'm getting a serial killer vibes. Yeaaah. Well, hey! You're a criminal attorney. There's your next case! Hahaha. Right. Alright. Hmmm. She looks like she steals things. My things. Yeah. You don't need that. Nope. Ooo! What about this guy?

You're not the prosecution and I'm not the defense. I withdraw the comment. Ughh. ISAAC: I'm sorry. It's just, difficult. ISAAC: You know, with the space, the angles. Once you fix this place up, you can remodel that shower. And then you can stop using that as an excuse. And the night is young. Uh. I've just got a lot on my mind. I need to be alone. Again? Just, just forget it. Forget it? You won't even let me get close to you anymore, Isaac. Look, I think we need a break. All the secrets and the chilly reception every time I try to just touch you-- - It, it's, it's-- - No. No, Isaac. If we're not going to talk about these things, I can't do it. I can't be fifty percent with you. SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES IN] I can't. Ash. Ash! Happy Anniversary, by the way. It was seven months today.

It's the only face I got. You're waiting for me to say something so you can sit on your high horse and judge. Well? Are you going to say something? Why don't you shut up? You're always trying to make shit hard. FAITH: You know that? Now, let us know what's up. We want to help you, babe. - With all my time off work- - Yeah, what is up with that? 'Cuz I mean with your attorney skills, you'll get snatched up like that. Like always. Are you confused about something? - Since I can remember. - Uh-oh! Shut your mouth! - Did Isaac just come out? - What? Did those rusty closet doors come flying off their hinges? - James! - What? Dude! I knew you was gay since high school-- And what makes you such an expert, RuPaul? Have you been hiding something from us? Have you been double-dipping after hours? - I'm not gay. Okay. Okay. - I'm not fucking gay. Okay. Okay, why are you confused? Is it Ashley? Ashley broke up with me. FAITH: Aw, man, babe. I am so sorry about that. Didn't see that coming! Owww! We was all getting the vibes! I'm not going to baby him. FAITH: You really lack empathy, you know that? You and Isaac have been friends the longest. And you are still such a fucking ass to him. - Right. - Yeah. You are being an ass, James. Wow. Was I being an ass when I saved your life? In case you forgot? Oh! And who did I save your ass from? I haven't forgotten. Right. ANT: Ughh, God. That 'phobe needs to shut up and be more understanding. Isaac, you were seventeen. That was over ten years ago! He has to stop holding that over your head. Even it was a hate crime he saved you from. - He took a beating for me. - Okay. Fine. He got his ass kicked. Isaac, he's holding you hostage with that. So. What's going on with you? Being with Ashley. It, it never excited me. - Maybe the first few times-- - Wait. It didn't excite you? As in, it didn't arouse you? - I don't know. - Come on. It's me. ANT: Okay, fine.

Great minds think alike. I spent many happy hours tucked away in those rooms. That's crazy. We were both there at the same time. I wonder if our paths ever crossed?

One of these other firms is going to snatch you up before you know it. You're sweet. By the way, your sister, uhh, She's a kick! Yeah. She's been through a lot. That's what she said about you. We- She. Had a very difficult childhood. We were adopted. And lucked out with really loving parents. Especially our mother. And then, Emily started having these horrible nightmares. I can't go into it, but it was really horrific. The counselors couldn't get to the heart of it. And she refused to talk about it, even now. Do you? Have nightmares? [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] Why do you ask? Well, last night it sounded like you cried out. In your sleep. I mean your door was locked, but It sounded like you were wrestling. With your sheets. Or maybe your demons? The crime lab analyst yields his forensic eye. Can we talk about something else? Sure! What about the uhh, the old love life? Is Mister Smith playing the field? I believe in client confidentiality. - Oh, do you now? Hmm. - Mmm-hmm! [EERIE TONE] ISAAC: He told me that if I ever told my parents, ISAAC: he would come back and kill them. ISAAC: And my sister, too. MARK: And they never caught the guy? I overheard my Dad talking about it. Apparently, the intruder just walked right into the houses. That's what the papers said. What I overheard. I don't understand why the guy kept targeting our house. How do you know it was a man? It could have been a woman. He penetrated me. [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES IN] The people that- do those awful things. They're really good at hiding. A lot of times nobody finds them. Emily said you, umm, you broke up with your girlfriend recently? Yeah. I was dating this girl but- something didn't feel- right. It happens. We all grow and, and change and sometimes people grow apart. I can tell you're going through a lot. So if you ever need somebody to talk to, I want you to ask me. SOFT DRAMATIC AMBIENT MUSIC] Hi!

You still have that look about you. You came from a place where this, SHAE: wasn't encouraged. SHAE: Most of us did. Some people come here to forget those times. Those moments. But people also come here to be proud of who they are. Proud to be who they really are. On the inside. You don't have to feel shame by looking at other man's body. Or whatever it is that's giving you that pain I see behind those eyes. Have you fallen in love, yet? And you've been hurt, I take it. Just don't get too caught up in your first gay love, Isaac. And don't you shy away from that word either. You own it, baby! I'm buying his. You should embrace who you are. Don't hide it. That's what love's all about. ¶ DRESSED IN COSTUMES THAT YOU PLAY ¶ ¶ JUST A CAST TO MAKE YOU SHINE ¶ [HIP HOP BEAT FADES IN] Yo, what the fuck, bro'? So, James.
