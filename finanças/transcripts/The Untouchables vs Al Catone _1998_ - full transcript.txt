The hard-working citizens of Cheesecago were continually menaced by a powerful gangster. His name, Al Catone. By using his gang of thugs and racketeers to carry out blackmail and extortion, Catone had cornered the cheese market and fixed prices to make himself a fortune. Money cheated from the citizens of Cheesecago, was used to bribe the highest officials from the city, including many police officers. With all the city's bigwigs, and nearly the entire police force under his control, Al Catone was virtually immune from prosecution. Politicians, judges, reporters, and sports stars, all got entangled in Catone's web of bribery. But the chest of a very important shipment of cheese was to have grave repercussions for the gangsters, for it was to bring about the Federal Mousehole of Investigation's decision to send its best agent to Cheesecago, Elliot Mouse, Gordon and Mister Wilson, and I was there on the spot to cover the breaking news. I'm Tino Beratti, top crime reporter for the Cheesecago Tribune. They say news travels fast. Well let me tell you it travels fastest, right here in the city police department. - And you can be sure of this department's fullest cooperation Agent Mouse. Now, what hotel are you staying in? - Hotel Gorgonzola. - Very well then gentlemen, I shall be in touch. - Room 215 to be exact. - Hello? Yeah, put me through to Mister Catone's suite. (phone ringing) - Yeah, who is it? - Yeah hello, is that you Mister Nitty? - Yeah, what's up? - I'm calling from the police station, and I got a very interesting bit of information that Mister Catone might want to hear about. - That's nice, don't move. That's perfect, well we're finished for the day. - Al Catone, friend of the common people, now go throw those rags in the garbage Anselme. - Okay boss, that's a shame, I thought I looked swell in this outfit. What do you think, Scalezi? - Come on Anselme, you look ridiculous, stop acting the clown and get that stuff off, will you? - Don't worry, we can find that out. Thanks for the information. Come by when you want to pick up an extra ration of cheese. - Thanks. - Senor Catone? - What is it, Nitty? - Some fed by the name of Elliot Mouse is out to bust us. I just got word of where he's staying. - That's great Nitty, why don't I just send Anselme and Scalezi here to welcome him to the neighborhood. (laughing) - Something sure stinks in the police department. Boy, I could sleep like a log. - Yeah, it smells bad to me too, Wilson. So the sooner we get on with it, the better. - Say when are we gonna eat, Elliot? All this traveling around has really whetted my appetite. - Your appetite doesn't need whetting Gordon, you're always hungry. - Me, always hungry? What are you talking about? - Excuse us sir, we have three rooms reserved here under my name, Elliot Mouse. - All right, just wait a minute and I'll have a look, okay? - Well guys, you could hardly call this place the Stilton or the Ritz. - I hope the food's better than the decor. - Right, here are your keys. Now these rooms have just been newly painted, so please don't go messing them up. - Thanks very much fellow. - Hey, this stuff's heavy, ain't we gonna wait for the bellhop? - Yeah, that's it. That's just about got it fixed. Now, we just tie it off. Those cops are sure gonna get a big bang out of it, when they open the door. - Bang. - What you doing? Shut up you fool, someone's coming upstairs. - Hey, just a minute, wait up you guys. Wait for me, will ya? - They're coming. Yeah that's them, come on let's get out of here. Not through the door stupid, out the window, come on. - 211, 212. - Here Gordon, let me help you, huh? - I'm way too hungry and I need something to eat. - Come on you idiot, come on. - Wait, wait. - Incredible, from what I've seen there are at least 20 violations of hotel law on this floor alone. - 215, well, this is my room guys. (yelling) (explosion) - Hey hey, we got him Scalezi. - Welcome to Cheesecago. - Wh- wh- wh- what was that? - A loud bedbug, or a booby trap. - What is going on? What have you ruffians been doing? - I love explosions. - I knew my idea couldn't fail. Come on now, start the engine. We gotta let the boss know the good news right away. - [Hotel Clerk] Hey, wait a minute, come back here. - So your plan couldn't fail, huh? - Move, let's pay a call. - Don't just sit there you lamebrain. Get after them. (tires squealing) - Who is going to pay for the damages? Hey, come back here. - [Gordon] So where is it we're going? - To the police station, Gordon. - You think the police might have had something to do with that bomb, don't you? - They're the only ones who knew where we'd be staying. Hit the deck. (machine guns firing) (tires squealing) - Look out! - Boy that was close. - Well that didn't hold them up for long, we'd better keep moving. - They're getting away, you moron. Come on, move, stop wasting time. - [Anselme] Look Scalezi, a pretty fountain. - [Scalezi] Come on, get this car out of here before we drown. - [Gordon] They're on our tail again. Better put your foot down. - The pedal's already down to the floor Gordon. - Okay Anselme, we got 'em, head 'em up the road. - They're gonna force us off. - Not if I can help it, they're not. - Come on, push 'em over the edge. Get rid of them. - Hold on tight! (groaning) - Those guys nearly finished us that time. - Wilson, Gordon, you guys okay? - I'm okay, but there is something that'll make me feel a whole lot better. - Yeah we know, eating a cheese sandwich. - So long, coppers. - These bad guys take their job seriously. - Time they found out who they're dealin' with. (guns firing) - Hey fellas, let's take 'em down shall we? - That bridge could be our only hope. Cover me while I go to the other side and cut them off, Wilson. - Wait a minute, I counted their shots. My calculations show they'll be out of ammo, now. - What now, my machine gun's empty Scalezi. - Keep firing. Come on, let's go. - Seems like you calculated wrong. - Hold it right there and drop your weapons. Missed, hold it, you're under arrest. - Run Wilson, Elliot needs backup. - Hey, you guys can't get away. - Who says so? - I say so. - Huh? - Come on, they've got us surrounded. - What do we say to Mister Catone? - Just drive stupid. - Cheese and crackers, we nearly had 'em. - Yeah, that's true, but at least we got 'em off or tail, Gordon. - Yeah, but for how long, Wilson? Those guys ain't about to give up that easily. - Yeah, you're right Elliot, welcome to Cheesecago. - Cheers guys, it's been quite a day. - Yeah, first the bad guys try to put us out of action by planting a bomb in our hotel room. Then they tried to drive us off the road, which they succeeded in doing. And finally, they shot at us. Have I missed anything? - So let's see, we've got no office, no car, no friends, and nowhere to stay tonight. - And if Gordon keeps drinking those cheese cocktails, we'll soon be out of money, too. - You were saying something.

Over by the stage? - No thanks Frenchy, I don't want a table, I come to get your order for cheese. So what'll it be this week? - Well you see Monsieur, if I may be allowed to explain. - Another rip-roaring night. - Are you saying you won't buy our cheese? - Oh just this week Monsieur, but these are difficult times, you know. - If that big rat-faced louse thinks he can push my partner around, he's got another think coming. - All right, cough it up. Where have you been getting your cheese from? Who's (speaking in foreign language)? - No no no, Monsieur Nitty, we only buy cheese from you, I give you my word on it. - That guy is now starting to annoy me. - Come here. Huh? - What do you think you're doing? - Ah Deborah, my cheese heart, how's things? Oh well, I was just discussing a little matter with an employee of yours. - He is no employee, he's a partner. - Ah yeah, sure, forgive me my sweet cheese, it's my memory. Well, my little fondue, your partner was just telling me that you do not require our cheese this week. Just a mistake. - There's no mistake, Nitty. Your prices are way too high. The prices are too high, and the cheese quality is very low indeed. - You know that could change if you wanted it to, my cheesecake. Come here with me, why don't you? All the cheese in the city could be yours. - Hey, now that guy's taking liberties. - I'm sorry, Mister Nitty, but I already told you I don't want your cheese. It just ain't good enough. And as a matter of fact, I think you should have some of it back. - Where am I? - That's it. - No one covers Rat Nitty in cheesecake. Sorry about this, sweet cheese, but I ain't gonna be nice to you, no more. - Oh, I'm really heartbroken. - Excuse me. - Huh? - Hey, don't you know it's bad manners to point a gun at a lady? - That was dumb, mister, you don't know who you're talking to. - Sorry, I forgot to introduce you. That was my good friend, Bull. - So it'll probably be better if I confiscate this one, so no one can get hurt. - Yes, you wait, you schmucks. I'll be seeing you again, you can bet your life on it. You've been a rat twice. - Go on, get! All right, you know where we'll be, cheese ball. Personally, I hate seeing good cheese wasted. - That rat won't be bothering you again, Miss. The name's Elliot Mouse. If you should be needing my assistance again. - Thank you Mister Elliot Mouse, but I know how to take care of these types myself. Now, if you will excuse me, you're not the only customer in the club. - Hoo, that sure is some woman, huh? - Oui Monsieur, Mademoiselle Deborah has a very individual way of doing things which brings nothing but trouble. - Speaking of trouble, I'd say that you fellas certainly know how to find it. - We ain't looking for trouble, why do you say that? - For good reason, you mean you do not know who you have just humiliated? - No. - Oh my dear, that was Rat Nitty, the right-hand man of Al Catone. You will all leave this city now, if you know what is good for you. - Leave Cheesecago? That's absolutely out of the question, friend. We're not here as tourists, you know. We're special agents with the Federal Mousehole of Investigation. - Oh, that's just what we needed, rookie policemen. - So you are the ones, we have been expecting you. And may I say it is a great pleasure Monsieur, to see that you are honest policemen. So, where are you going to start mon ami? - Well, we can't do very much just right now. Someone set a trap for us when we got here. We don't have a place to stay or any transport. - Yeah, we haven't even got somewhere we can go and eat. (speaking in foreign language) - Perhaps you can help them, Monsieur Jack. - Me? Oh all right men. You look like decent enough mice to me, so I'll take you to a place where you'll be safe. - [Waiter] Thank you Monsieur Jack. - [G Men] Yeah, thanks Jack. - Upset? Me upset? Just because you let some rookie feds make monkeys out of you? You bet I'm upset. The booby trap bomb gag never failed, boss. It'll be a cinch, boss. Lame brains! - But boss, you don't have to worry about them rookies anymore. They got away, but we scared 'em. - Listen boss, I'm sure they've left the city, already. - Senor Catone. Senor Catone I've got something very important to tell you. - What's that smell? You know I hate the smell of cheese, Nitty. - I found out something important. - So speak. - Someone else is selling cheese in our district, Senor Catone, and now no one will buy our cheese. What's more, they even went to the expense of wasting it by throwing a cheesecake right in my face. - You don't say? - That ain't all, at Deborah's club there were three thugs who threw me out in the street. - So who were these three bad men? - I don't know, Senor, I've never seen them before. Except that the head guy wore a daberdeen, and there was a fat sharpshooter, and a third guy was-- - Hey. - Huh? He wear specs? - Don't mention his glasses, you moron. - Yeah, he did. How did you guys know that? - Well it could be those agents who got away from us. - Huh? - Now these feds are starting to annoy me. Thanks to you numbskulls my business is suffering, and my reputation is tarnished, and that ain't healthy. Not for them, and not for you. Now the Cheese Paree is getting cheese from somewhere, so tonight you've got the warehouse, understand? - Yeah boss, we understand. - If you do see somebody stealing, don't stop them, just follow them. I've gotta find out who's behind all this. - Yeah boss, we'll find 'em. - Here we are fellas. It may look a bit of a mess, but you'll be safe here. Make yourselves as comfortable as you can for tonight. I'll try and find you something better by tomorrow. - Thanks Jack, that's a big help. - Well, this isn't all bad. - Yeah, at least there's a mattress over there to sleep on. - Yeah, and we also got ourselves a friend. - Well folks, looks like the shows over for today. But things should start humming up tomorrow. (light instrumental music) (sniffing) - Hey fellas, my nose smells cheese, and my nose is never wrong, and it's coming from over there, come on, this way. All we gotta do is follow my nose. - Oh dear. He's always thinking of his stomach. Hey, shouldn't we wait for Jack? He might not want us poking around his place without his being here. - Bad news fellas, the security guards at the cheese depot didn't all asleep once. - Oh heck, that means they've woken up to the fact we've been stealing all their cheese. - Hey, that means no more cheese. What are we gonna do now, Moony? - [Moony] I don't know Junior, but I don't see why I should put my whiskers on the line for this cheese just to give it away. - [Junior] You disappoint me Moony, sometimes you sound just like a gangster. - Maybe being a gangster ain't so bad. - Look at this! Hey Elliot, Wilson, come and see what I found. - Come on you guys, let's get out of here. - Huh? Hey! - We gotta catch them little squirts, Elliot. - [Elliot] All right you kids, hold it right there. - Sorry mister, I'd love to stop and chat, but I've got an appointment. - Will somebody tell me what's going on? - We came just in time, Jack. We caught these petty thieves in your garage, they were trying to escape. - Petty thieves? No, these little guys are my friends. Are you all right there, Junior? - Oh boy, I got a headache. - Hey, are you saying that you know these guys, Jack? - That's right, no worry Robin, you can trust them. They're federal agents. Elliot Mouse, that one's Gordon, and Mister Wilson. - You mean these guys are really federal agents? - Excuse me, where'd all the cheese come from? - It comes from Catone's warehouse. - So you know the location of the secret warehouses, where all the cheese stolen from Cheesecago's businesses is kept, right? - That's right. The whole city knows it. Only these three have the courage to take cheese away from Al Catone. - And you fellas keep it all? - No, what we do is return it to its rightful owners. - A noble gesture Jack, but the correct thing to do would be to tell the police about it. - Now that wouldn't do a bit of good, lad. I left the police force because so many of my buddies worked for Al Catone. Now I feel I'm being much more useful. - Well, we still won't get Catone this way, but if we join forces, can we visit Catone's secret warehouses tonight? - Yeah, we sure can. The security guards are bound to be asleep tonight. - Don't you worry about the security guards, shortstuff. Tonight they're gonna be the ones who'll have to worry about us. (snoring) (dark music) - I don't believe it, Anselme's asleep again. Then he says it's always me who falls asleep on duty. How could I with snoring like that. - There, up ahead. - Huh, hey wake up Anselme, we've got some visitors. - Huh, we got visitors? Oh no, is it the boss? - No dummy, it'll be some lowlife thieves. Now hurry up and hide. - Federal agents, this is a bust. Now come out with your hands high and don't try anything. Come on. - Shall we go out then? - What are you, nuts? Quiet, stupid. - Doesn't look as though there's anyone here, guys. Looks like it's all ours. Come on then, let's load the truck as fast as we can. - What do we gotta do now, Scalezi? - Nothing, the boss said to follow the thieves, and find out who their working for, so we'll just have to wait for a little while, till they leave. - Roquefort, 29. - These guys sure have the good stuff. - Oh. - Here's another one. - Robin, we were real stupid to let this Elliot Mouse talk us into this. Now Catone's gonna know who we are. - I trust him. I ain't never seen an agent as brave as him. See. - Here. Come on fellas, just a few more left. - What are we gonna do? Huh? - We'll let our guns do the explaining for us. We ain't got no choice. - Hey, leave those. You can't get in another single cheese. - Well, I can always find room in my stomach for one more. Here. - Huh? Hey, thanks Mister Gordon. - [Wilson] Well, that just about wraps it up. - Good, how many have we loaded, Wilson? - Well, if the weight on the boxes is correct, a little over two tons. - Well done everybody, now let's get this load down to the police station. Right Jack? - Yes, to the police station, 'cause that's the best way of showing the people of Cheesecago that we can take on Al Catone. - That's right, Jack, justice is coming back to this city. And with a little luck, it won't be long before law and order gets the respect it deserves. Huh, oh no. - Moony has stolen the truck. - They're all leaving Scalezi, who do we follow now? - The truck, ya dummy, 'cause that's where the cheese is. Come on, let's go get the car. - I don't understand it. - Looks like your little speech didn't convince Moony, and he's taken off with the cheese. I just wish I knew what he plans to do with it. - We've gotta find him fast, Elliot, before he meets up with some real gangsters. - It could be easy but we don't know where to start looking. - But we do, now come lads. We'll search the whole of Cheesecago. - Great Jack, we'll head for the police station. Despite what you said, their help might still be useful. - All right, if you must, but trust no one except Chief Stalk, despite his defects, the man's an honest cop. - Sure thing, Jack, I'll keep that in mind. - Yes, do that. Well, we'll see you back at the club. (jazz piano playing) - Hey, it stopped in front of the boss' place. - Oh. - Come on, let's take the stairs. (knocking on door) - Hey, big nose. - What do you want, you scruffy little brat? - Go get your boss, rat. I got some business with him. - Oh yeah, well why don't you tell me all about it. - No, I gotta tell him personally, I don't deal with hired hands. - Oh yeah, well just who do you think you are, midget? - Our cheese thief. You're too late, kid. We got ya. - So I shouldn't say anything about this cheese, Mister Mouse, is that right? - Not so loud. They might hear you. - [Chief] What'll I tell my men, so they can look out for the stuff. - Simple, you tell 'em to look out for a kid driving a truck, and that he's too young to have a drivers license. - Remember, don't say what's in the truck. - No, we wouldn't want to lose all that lovely cheese. - Shhh. - Give out the info, who you workin' for? - I told you already, Nitty, I'm only working for myself. It's like a told you, the bad guys took us down the the warehouse, but I was too smart for them see, and I took off with the goods. - Reminds me of myself when I was young. - So why'd you come here? You trying to tie Senor Catone into selling cheese? - No, I just heard it was real easy to trick you, Nitty, and I wanted to do business with your boss, see? - Well, you got your information all wrong, half pint. Give him another soaking Scalezi. You know he hates water. (phone ringing) The soda's on you kid. Yeah, who is it? - It's me Bourbon, the feds are looking for some little kid in order to get the cheese back. - It's our man inside the police station, Senor Catone. He says that Elliot Mouse is looking for the boy and the cheese. - If Mister Mouse wants to find him, we'll let him do so, but in the right place. - It's our cheese truck. That mug Moony's done just what I thought he would. Trying to strike a deal with Catone. - Hurry it up. Let's move. To the docks. Let's get out of here. - Hey Pierre, how's tricks? Give me the usual will you? Had any news from Jack, yet? - Afraid not, Monsieur. - The poor kid, he should have had more faith in our plan. - You gotta do more than show a badge to get someone's trust in this town. - Guess I'm finding that out Miss Deborah. - There an Agent Mouse here? - Yeah, I'm Mouse, what's the news? - Chief Stun sent me to tell you that we found the truck. - Come on, we ain't got a moment to lose. - I guess you were right after all, sonny. The business you wanted to do with us was very important. So important that we're gonna be able to get rid of Elliot Mouse and his meddlesome friends, once and for all. - Uh oh. I gotta warn Jack. - Sounds like our visitors now, let's hide. - This is the place. - Elliot, door's open. - Watch your backs, we're going in. - Wait, I thought I heard something. - Hold it right there, copper, you're little outing's over, so drop the heaters. - No, tell your goons to drop theirs, Nitty, it's four against three. - You're right copper, but it's three of you against four of us. - Okay fellas, drop the hardware, nice and easy. Now don't try anything. - You lousy double-crosser. - Ha ha ha, we caught you Elliot Mouse, we're the greatest. - Just tell us what you done to Moony, you rat-faced put. - You don't have to worry about your diminutive friend, Mister Mouse, he's about to go on a little trip. - Huh. - [Nitty] To the bottom of the leak. - Moony? - [Junior] We've asked everyone we know, and none of them have seen Moony. - Jack, Junior, Moony's been taken. Catone's gang have taken him to the docks. - Sounds like they pulled a fast one. - And they've laid a trap for that agent Elliot Mouse and his friends. - Well, what are we gonna do, Jack? - [Jack] We've gotta move, and fast. I think the time has come to test the project I've been working on this past two years. - Hey. - Gentlemen, I give you the Armstrong 326. Now hop in and hold on tight. (tires squealing) - Oh boy. - Now this is what I call a car. - [Jack] Now let's go and rescue Moony. - Come on, stop fooling around lamebrains, get him in the cleave. - We can't Nitty. - Yeah, this guy's too fat. - Boys let's fit these nice gentlemen with some cement overcoats. - The kid's all set, Rat Nitty. - This is it, hairball, time you went for a little dip. - Let Moony go, Nitty, ya two-bit hoodlum. - We're here, there's the storage depot. It's impolite, but we'll go in without knocking. - I got it Nitty, you just give me the word. - Seems we're just in time, gentlemen. - And boy, are we glad to see you. - Now then, these racketeers have been careful. Now they'll see what this baby can do. - What was that, Jack? - It's melted cheese, just one of my beauty's many surprises. Are you okay? - [Elliot] We are, but Moony's still in danger. - Don't worry Moony, we'll get you down, hang on. - Hey now, what happened? - Hey, get us out of this fondue you idiot. - So, how's everything going? - Fine, I've almost got it. - Hey Jack, that cheese of yours, can you eat it? - Huh, can't you see that Jack's busy? - Well, you sure took your time. - Got it. - Hey hey, it works. - Huh? Look out, those thugs are getting away. - Just leave 'em to me, let's see if they think I'm fat now. - Come on dope, move it. - Lighten up, I'll give them something to think about. - No, Moony! - Give me some slack, Jack, I'm going after the kid. - [Gordon] You need me here? - That's all right, we can take care of this. - Good, I've got some business to take care of. - Hold on, Moony, okay? They're coming up. Well, you made it just in time. - Are you all right, Elliot? - [Elliot] Did those hoods get away? - [Robin] Mister Gordon went after them. - Come on, Anselme, the feds are here already. Start the engine, Scalezi, move it. - All right, you asked for it. Go get 'em Bill. - Hey, what is this? Get off me. Help, get off. Hey, Nitty, stop. Help me get rid of this thing. - Okay Moony, I'll crack this like a nut. - Okay young man, you owe us an explanation for your behavior. - I just thought that since the cheese would end up in Catone's hands anyway, I'd take it and get something out of it myself. - Well guys, I can assure you that this cheese will not fall into Al Catone's hands. And at the same time we can make him realize that we're catching on to his little racket. - Yeah we had them in the palm of our hands, Senor Catone. There were so many we were lucky to get away when we did. It was real close. (phone ringing) - They'll take the cheese to the police station. - Our friends there'll get it to us. No problem. - [Al] Right, see that they do, and don't come any closer Anselme, you know I hate the smell of cheese. (burping) - They did what? - What is it, Nitty? - It was one of our guys in the police station. Elliot Mouse is distributing our cheese to the poor people. - What? Why you idiot. - All right, now who's next? - Me, I got my receipt right here, buddy. - Four roquefort and two Swiss cheese, come on Gordon, hurry up, there's still lots of work to be done. - I had my heart set on a truckload of cheese. - Hey Chief, why is the cheese being distributed like this? - Oh, we're simply returning it to its rightful owners. - So this is the cheese that was stolen from all the cheese stores in Cheesecago? - Sure, and it was recovered by Elliot Mouse, and friends. - And why is all cheese being returned so publicly. - So the residents of this city don't give up hope. And to prove that together we can outsmart all the gangsters in Cheesecago. (big band music) - So how about it Jack, you feel strong enough to join the fight once again? - The truth is I find it rather exciting. Count me in, and you can use my car and garage. - A garage, yeah, wouldn't Jack's garage make a great headquarters for us? - Yeah, there we'd be safe from Catone's informers. - Yeah, you said it Elliot. No one could bribe us, not with all the cheese there was in the world. We'd be untouchable. - Bonsoir Monsieur, compliments of the house, speciality, Cheese Paree. - Compliments of the house? - As an apology. - Let's drink a toast to the untouchables. - The untouchables? - Yeah, let's drink to it guys. Here's to us, the untouchables. - [All] To the untouchables. - Hey, excuse me gentlemen, I'm Tino Beratti from the Cheesecago Tribune. Mind if I take your picture? - Go ahead, but send us a copy. - No problem, now say cheese. And that is how Elliot Mouse and his friends came to be known as, The Untouchables. In the weeks that followed, The Untouchables laid siege of the criminal empire, of the gangster Catone. - Get your hands in the air. - Hold it, wise guy. - It's the FMI. - Drop the heaters, nice and easy. - [News Reporter] There wasn't a door built that could keep out the fabulous Armstrong 326. - FMI. You're under arrest. - [News Reporter] Jack's invention revealed a dazzling array secret weapons. The Untouchables' tenacity led them to the most elaborate hideouts, enabling them to reclaim vast stocks of cheese. - [Gordon] Guess we found what we were looking for. - [News Reporter] And when the bad guys made a run for it, Gordon's special bullets were always at hand. - Okay bad guys, think you can run fast, huh? Well try and outrun this little beauty. Get 'em Beryl. - Let's get out of here. Move it lamebrain. - [News Reporter] The poor suckers didn't stand a chance. - Go get a bite to eat, Paul. - [News Reporter] Law and order was slowly returning to Cheesecago, but it was still too early to claim a victory. Someday soon. Catone's goons could easily bribe their way out of prison, and the fat cat himself was proving a tough nut to crack. Other criminal gangs were quick to seize the opportunity to move in on Catone's territory, as pressure on the Neapolitan gangster increased. - Get out there and protect my investments Scalezi. Run our enemies out of town, and get those feds off my back, now move it. - [News Reporter] One such gang was that of dangerous racketeer Dog Moran, and his cohorts Kevin Nighs and Sharpnose Clark, who were quick to exploit the ever-widening cracks in Catone's empire. Every dog must have his day, but Moran had more than his fair share. - Business is booming boys. - [News Reporter] Events in Cheesecago even attracted the attention of the major film studios in Mousywood, such as Paramouse, 20th Century Dog, and Metro Goldwyn Meower. Paramouse decided to shoot their next gangster movie on location in Cheesecago itself. It was to star the beautiful Rita Mouseworth, who had recently been awarded a Cheddar by the film academy. She arrived in Cheesecago, accompanied by Bushy Siegel, a known gangster and racketeer from New Gruyere, who loved hanging out with the stars. His presence in Cheesecago warranted discreet but close surveillance by The Untouchables. - Ah, welcome madame. - Hey over here son, be careful not to touch any buttons on the dashboard, it could be dangerous. - Yes sir, whatever you say. - Hey Deborah, I heard they do a great three-cheese fondue at this restaurant. Nice, huh? - It sure is, and I'm looking forward to trying that fondue. Before we eat Elliot, what's behind this invitation tonight? - From the first time we walked into your club, things have been going great for us. Being close to you brings me luck, you know. - Oh great, I always wanted to be somebody's lucky charm. - It ain't that Deborah, it's just that I feel I-- - Your three-cheese fondue, Monsieur. Madame, please allow me. - Great, I just can't wait to try it, come on Deborah, we can't let it go cold. - Don't worry Elliot, the fondue won't get cold. It's got a burner underneath, so you can continue with what you were saying. - Oh yeah, I knew that, I mean yeah of course. - Huh? - Huh? - [Woman] Look, isn't that? - [Man] Yeah, Rita Mouseworth in the flesh, wow. - What's going on over there? - It's only some movie star who's just arrived in the city, and wearing too much makeup if you ask me. - What would sir like tonight? - The usual. - Of course. - The most expensive dish you've got here, the caviar we had yesterday, all right? - [Waiter] Beluga caviar and a beer. - And bring plenty of it. Nothing but the best for my girl. - Sure thing honey, always the best. - Hey I'm sorry, my piece of bread fell into the pot, Deborah. - Well there's a custom in this restaurant. The first person to lose their piece of bread in the fondue has to invite the other one out to dinner. - Well I don't think I'll have any problem with that. - And just maybe, you'll pay attention to me then. - What are you talking about, Deborah? I'm giving you my full attention. I wouldn't, huh? - Cut the soft cheese Elliot, ever since that Mouseworth broad arrived, you haven't been able to take your eyes off of her. - [Elliot] Yeah well you know, it's not often you get a chance to see a film star like Rita Mouseworth close up. It's natural to be curious. - Excuse me ladies and gents, I hate to interrupt. I'm looking for Mister Bushy Siegel. - Hey I'm Bushy Siegel. Who wants me? - Well I got a message for you from Al Catone. Welcome to Cheesecago. (screaming) - All right. - Hey! (screaming) Eat this. Oh no. Hey hey, it burns. Hey, what happened? Who took my car? - Oh, the valet parked it. - I never told the stupid kid to park it. - He ran around to the parking lot. - [Valet] Hey, I didn't park it yet. - [Gangster] Get off of my car. - We got the license. - Good, we gotta trace that car. That thug just tried to shoot Bushy Siegel. Let's get some answers. Where's Gordon? - He's inspecting the kitchens Elliot. - Well that passes the Gordon inspection. - It's okay honey, calm down, it's all over. - FMI, you need some assistance, Ma'am? - Gordon, what are you doing here? How did you get to the restaurant so quickly? - What, you mean Elliot didn't say anything to you about helping out with our stakeout? - About helping out with what, Gordon? - We're keeping this guy Siegel under surveillance, that's what we're all doing here. Look, here come the others now. - I'm sorry our evening got interrupted like this, Deborah. I was having such a good time. - Oh my hero! You saved my life! Oh, help protect me. My sweet baby! - Calm down Miss, you and your friend should report this to the police station. - No thanks mister, I don't like spending too much time at police stations. - I'll come with you my knight in shining armor, I will go with you to the ends of the Earth if necessary my darling. - Don't get any ideas about using me again. Goodbye. - What's got into her? Why is she so angry all of a sudden? - Oh who knows? I really don't have any idea, Elliot. - Come on, Gordon. - I've checked the files and license number 5846 belongs to Dog Moran's car. - First an unknown gunman uses Catone's name in front of a room full of witnesses. - But Catone would never let any of his thugs implicate him, and the guy was a stranger. - That's right, Gordon, and now it turns out that the car this would-be assassin used belongs to Dog Moran. It don't make sense at all. - Maybe Moran did it to try and get Catone the blame for the shooting. - But Jack, in that case, why would he use his own car? - Help us out here, Mister Siegel, do you know of anyone who'd want you out of the way? - I don't even know these guys, only what I read about them in the New Gruyere newspapers. This is my very first time in Cheesecago, you can check. - The attacks were definitely aimed at you, Mister Siegel, no matter what you say. The best thing you could do is head back to New Gruyere immediately. - All right I'll do it, I'll take the first train back to New Gruyere, just to show you I don't want any trouble. - Hey hey hey, whoa. - I can't leave Cheesecago till I finish the movie. Who'll protect me? Will you stay beside me, Elliot? - I'm sorry, I have other official responsibilities Miss Mouseworth. - Call me Rita, and please say you'll never leave me Elliot. - [Elliot] Well okay, we'll accompany you to the film set. - Who'd have thought in such a cold city I'd find the flame of true love. - [Elliot] We've arrived. - This is quite some hot rod you've got here, mister. What make is it, exactly? - Mine, I designed it myself. - Oh yeah, well I like it a lot. How much do you want for it? Money is no object. - [Jack] It's not for sale. - [Bushy] Gee, that's too bad. - What the-- all right then, you cheese balls. This is it, show down. Try and set a trap for us, will you Anselme, well trap this. Not forgetting your friend. You two put your hands up and don't budge an inch. - Yeah yeah all right, but we haven't done anything. - What's going on Gordon? - I caught 'em red-handed Elliot, looks like they were plotting something against that Bushy fellow. - What are you talking about, you dumb fed. We only came here because they wanted some tough guys to be in their film. - That's what I call a tough guy, wouldn't you agree with me, Mister Stronghead? - Yeah, we think alike for once, Hotstein, bond him. - You want me in a film? - That's right, allow me to introduce myself, Dashiel Hamster, the writer of this movie, and you'd be perfect for the part of Scratchface. - True gangsters, that would be the lead player. - Me play a gangster, no way. - You gotta be kidding, he ain't got no experience. We're the ones who should play that. - Hey, it doesn't seem like such a bad idea to me Gordon, while you're here you can keep all the rotten apples in one barrel. - Well, I still don't like it. - Gentlemen, we can leave for the station whenever it suits you. I put my luggage in the car already. - Okay, let's get to the station. - Okay sweetie. (grunting) (screaming) - I got you Laurie. - Oh thank you, my hero, you saved my life, oh hold me tightly. Thank you. My brave boy. - Cut it yeah gut. - Oh, Elliot! So did you see it? How was I Elliot, what did you think? - You were great, but I've seen that act somewhere before. - I've finished for the day, wait until I change, then you can take me out somewhere nice. - Okay sure. - Come along everyone, to their places, we have another scene to shoot. - Hey Elliot. - Hey everyone, take cover. - Come on Elliot, don't get the cheese up, it's me. - This car gives you certain kinds of-- - Cut it out, it's only makeup, in the meantime I'm keeping the hoods under surveillance. Gotta go, I'm wanted on set. - I'll just find us a cab. - Where are you taking me on our first date, Elliot? - I happen to know a great little club where my friends are waiting for us. - With your friends, that sounds romantic. - Here's a present for you. - Move it Rita. Get down! (explosion) Are you all right, Rita? Okay, here you go. - But Elliot, I'm scared. - Don't worry, it's all over. Now where did I see that car before? - Here we are. Okay. Just as I thought. - Ah, Monsieur Elliot, welcome welcome, we have not seen you here for an age. - Tell me, Pierre, who's honoring us with their presence tonight? Who's the one with the car? - That is Monsieur Nitty's car, but please come in and have a wonderful time. ♪ A rat out of me ♪ ♪ I'm cute and I'm cool but I'm nobody's fool ♪ - Right Nitty, I'm gonna settle with you once and for all. - What are you doing? Let me go. - What's going on? - Hold it, Elliot, what's got into you? Calm down, will ya? - What do you think you're doing? I do not allow brawling Mister Mouse, how dare you start a fight in my club? - This ratfink threw a grenade at us a few moments ago. - It can't have been Nitty, I've been keeping him under surveillance. I haven't taken my eyes off him, and he hasn't left this club all evening. - That's right, I'm also a witness. - Yeah listen Elliot, he's been sitting in this club for precisely two hours, 13 minutes, and 26 seconds. - It's okay, you all right Nitty? - Oh sure kid, it weren't nothin'. If this is how you're gonna pay attention to me, he can hit me again. - And when exactly did you become a gangster's nurse? - Mister Nitty and I have a date to go out together after the show, if it's any of your business. - What, you mean you're thinking of going out with that cheese ball? - So now you think you have the right to tell me who I can and can't go out with? - That's not what I'm saying, Deborah, and you know it. I just don't think you show very good taste, that's all. - Boy, that's rich coming from you, seeing the harpy you've got on your arm. - How dare you talk to me like that, blondie, take that. - Hey, stop that, come on. (cross yelling) - Oh no, look Elliot, I've broken a fingernail now. - Hey, it ain't that bad. - What do you mean, it ain't that bad? It's a good thing the studio took out insurance on me, before I left for this dreadful city. - What insurance? - They insured me for several million cheese dollars. - Are you people gonna leave my club, or do I have to call the police? - Please, do not do that Mademoiselle. These are our friends, remember. - Let's go fellas, we've got something important to discuss, and I don't trust this place, or the kind of clientele they've got here. So the beneficiary of your policy is the film studio itself? - [Rita] Yeah, to cover any losses they might have if something happened to me. - Friends, I think we've been mistaken from the beginning, but now I know that the object of all these attacks has been Rita, herself. - So the attack on Bushy Siegel, and attempts to implicate Dog Moran, were to put us off the scent? - Exactly, I think the studio's behind the whole thing. And I'm betting they want to cash in Rita's insurance policy. - I don't get it. Why would they want to claim Rita's insurance, when they could make a lot more money with her starring in the movie? - That's something we're gonna have to find out, if we're gonna prove it. - We need to prove they wanted her out of the way, but you can leave that to me, Elliot, I've got a feeling I know where I can get all the information necessary. - In the meantime, Jack and I will stick with Rita. With the help of Scratchface Gordon, we'll have her under protection, all the time. - [Jack] I can't wait to see how Gordon's coming on as an actor. - I stand here, that right? - Yeah, yeah, that is perfect. Only then we will make it even more dramatical. - Now look here Mister Stronghead, none of this is in the script, I didn't write a word of it. - Yeah, I know, but I'm making this change to make this storyline more profound. - Dead end street scene 27, take one. - Cheese is the root of all power. Have it or have it not, that is the question. Whoa there. - Cut, cut, cut. The fan must blow softer, I need wind not a hurricane. Okay, give him some more cheese and we go again. - Here we go again, dead end street scene 27, take two. - [Director] Action. - The root of all power. To have cheese or, not to have cheese, that is the question. - Cut, way to early, bring more cheese. - I think I may have something for you, Wilson. Rita Mouseworth's last two films bombed at the box office, and the film studio's practically gone broke. That help? - So Elliot was right. And that explains why they want to collect Rita's insurance policy. - It's all here, just take a look. - Of course, why didn't I think of that before? I'm going to the train station. - Hey, wait up, I'm coming with you, you promised me an exclusive on this, remember? - Dead end street scene 27, take 93. - Ah, to have cheese or not to have power. - Stop, enough, I can't take any more. On to the next scene everyone. - Shouldn't we at least try it again? - We must shoot the next scene of the film, everyone get ready. - [Man] Ready for you now, Miss Mouseworth. - Okay, they're calling me onto the set, so I'd better get going now, Rita. Do you think they might possibly take me for you? - I guess anything's possible, but I always do dangerous scenes myself. Why should today be the first time I use a double? - Now, here's how it goes. Listen, Scratchface runs down the alley with the girl, you tell him to stop, but he pulls a gun. - And so you open fire. Scratchface with the last desperate act of courage, throws himself between the girl and the bullets in order to save her life. Okay, so everyone, positions please. Let's make this a doozy. - Wait up Gordon, we don't want anything going wrong. Have you checked the weapons? - Of course, they've all got starting pistols, except for me, so if anyone starts anything, then they're gonna be in for a big surprise. - Good. - Everyone in positions, start the fan, now. - Okay, here we go, dead end street scene 45, take one. - Police, get your hands up, you no good gangster. - Don't shoot, don't shoot. - Not you dummy, you're playing a cop, remember. We're the good guys. - Stay back, you'll never take me alive, you dumb flatfoot. - Take it. - I hate you, even with blanks. - Hey relax Elliot, those ricochets are only firecrackers stuck in the wall. - Look out everyone. - Cut, cut, am I going crazy, I did not ask for feathers. - There he is, Gordon. - It's okay, I see him. This is a job for you, Boll. Go get him. - Hold it. Okay, get up wise guy, you're coming with me. You're under arrest for attempted murder. - Hey, I thought we were supposed to say that, huh? - Shut up moron, this ain't part of the movie. - Okay tough guy, you're gonna tell us who you're working for. (Rita screaming) - [Rita] Help! - [Bushy] Hold it right there. Don't take another step, flatfoot. - It's Bushy Siegel. Yeah, you guys ruined everything with your interference. But don't you think I'm gonna let you get away with it, Mister Mouse. - This way, Mister Siegel, one photo for the press please. - I got a couple of things to put to you, Mister Siegel, my right fist, and my left fist. I was wondering if I'd see some action. He never left Cheesecago at all. He stopped to try to collect Rita's insurance in order to cover his previous losses, huh? - Oh, my hero, you saved my life. Oh, hold me tight. - Oh, now calm down Miss. - Turns out, Siegel himself is Rita's studio boss, and when her films lost money, so did he. - Someone get her off of me please. Come on guys, help me, help! - And goodbye my friends. It's been a wonderful experience and thanks to you I've been able to finish my movie. Also I must say you're terrible acting caused me to cut scene 27 altogether. - It doesn't matter, it's better like that, just as I wrote it. Goodbye my friend, and thank you. - Goodbye my knight in shining armor, I'll never forget you. - [Wilson] Yeah, thanks a lot Miss Mouseworth. - Hello Elliot, Pierre convinced me that I should come and apologize to you after acting so badly. - No Deborah, not at all. It's me who should be the one apologizing, and by the way, I still think I owe you a dinner, so would you care to accompany me to the Fondue Door this evening? - You got it, Elliot, but on one condition, that while we're there you promise not to run out on any special mission. - You got a deal. - And that's how The Untouchables put Bushy Siegel behind bars, but the story doesn't end there folks. New Gruyere police want Bushy Siegel. Existing warrants have caused Siegel's transfer to New Gruyere by the Untouchables. Already, plans are underway to spring Bushy Siegel, as key players in the underworld convened a special meeting in Cheesecago itself. Some of he most dangerous gangsters in the country were arriving in Cheesecago that very morning. Lucky Catiano, Bushy Siegel's close associate from New Gruyere. Vito Catlione, and the Brothers Luigi and Vincenzo Catlobrese. (dramatic orchestral music) Say, hi ya Gordon. Tell me, who's the old guy in the wheelchair? - Hey now, shhh. What are you trying to do, tell everybody who I am? - Take it easy Gordon, there's no one looking. Do you know who it is? - Well I don't know, I can't make him out from here. Hey now wait a minute. (popping) - Ah, my foot! My little tootsie. - Yeah, that's Don Lupo, he suffers from terrible gout, you know. - Don Lupo himself? Big cheese of the Black Mob, the most powerful crime syndicate in the world? Huh? Where has Agent Gordon gone? He must have smelled cheese somewhere. - Will you require an armed escort for Siegel's transfer to New Gruyere, Agent Mouse? - I don't think that would be a good idea, Chief. We don't need to attract the attention of more gangsters to this operation. - But what if they find out what you're doing? You know they're gonna try and spring Bushy Siegel, and you can bet those hoodlums will have every route covered from here to New Gruyere. - Don't worry Chief, I've got it all figured out. We're gonna use a double to throw anyone off the scent who might be following. - Besides, I'm sure a little action now and then wouldn't do us any harm, right. - Here we are, open up Officer Catlamity. - Here you go. - Well if it ain't the famous unmentionables. So Mouse, to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit? - We're getting you out, Siegel, and you're going on a long trip to the inside of another jail cell in New Gruyere. - Think you can get me all the way there, Mouse? - Huh? - I very much doubt it. You ain't got a hope. - Excuse me, Officer Catlamity, would you mind removing your hat and standing next to the prisoner for a moment? - Okay, yeah sure, if you want me to. - Hey fells, don't you think they look like each other? - Superficially, they're very similar, and they're exactly the same height. - This guy don't look like me, he's hardly got any hair. - We can solve that problem, Siegel. - Well, here's just what we're looking for, guys. Allow me to introduce our double. - You can't be serious. Officer Catlamity is jinxed. He brings nothing but bad luck. Ever since he's been in charge of the cells down here, there's not been one prisoner escape, do you hear me? Not one. - Well so what? How can that be bad luck? - Just try asking any of the prisoners who try to escape. - Okay, you ain't taking me nowhere copper. - There you are, what did I tell you? - Sure was unlucky. Well, I still think we'll take our chances. Okay fellas, come on, let's go, we've got a lot of stuff to organize. - Did you hear that, Catlamity's leaving. - This is great, someone up there must have heard our prayers. No. - [Catone] So everyone's here, right. Let's get down to business before our boys start getting trigger-happy. - I agree, so if Don Lupo will give us his permission, we can begin. - Yes, it's time we got this meeting started. - What do they say, it's somebody's birthday. - No, it's a black power meeting Senor. Do you give your permission for it to begin? - Of course, let's start, but I get to blow the candles out, right. - Let Lucky Catiano speak, he call the meeting. - Well, as you all know, my best friend, Bushy Siegel, was arrested by federal agents right here in Cheesecago. - He came looking for trouble, and he found it. - That's right, he tried to start a war between us, but we can do that ourselves, right Catone? What do you say to that? - [Lucky] I think there's some misunderstanding here. - All right, it's just the telephone. Calm down, will ya? Now then if you will excuse me? (phone ringing) Yeah, this is Rat Nitty here, who's speaking? - This is Officer Catlamity for Mister Catone. - Senor Catone can't be disturbed. So, what do you want? - I'm at the headquarters of the Untouchables. They've got Mister Siegel, and they're transferring him to New Gruyere tomorrow. - Nice work, can you tell me anything else? - Yeah, they want to use me as Siegel's double to trick you, and I'm gonna be, what? Everything's falling to pieces. - Hey Catlamity, are you still there? Why is it we can never get information from that schmuck without something bad happening? Huh? - It seems to be a misunderstanding. So let's decide how to help Bushy. - Let the rules of the Black Mob be applied. Dog Moran and Al Catone should engineer the rescue. - I agree with the Brothers Catlobrese, but to be fair, Bushy Siegel and Lucky Catiano should be made to pay for our services. - Whoever frees Siegel will be well-rewarded, I swear. - That's the kind of deal that I like. (knocking on door) - Excuse me, but the refreshments you ordered have arrived, Senor Catone. - All right, bring them in. What is it, Nitty? - That was Officer Catlamity, he's inside the Untouchables' headquarters. They're transferring Bushy Siegel tomorrow, and they're gonna use him a double. - Better not say anything, we'll keep this information to ourselves, right? Okay friends, I'm gonna tell you the latest news, but please, eat. - This is really good food. - I have just been most reliably informed that Bushy Siegel is being held at the headquarters of The Untouchables, prior to their transferring him over to New Gruyere tomorrow. - I want the cake, I want one. - Hold on, Don Lupo. Hey, these are sweet pastries. - The best in old Cheesecago, anything wrong? - Doc says, sweet things are Don Lupo's enemies. I eliminate Don Lupo's enemies. (gun firing) (crosstalk) - All right then, so we're all set. So when they come out, we launch a surprise attack. - There, there's Moran's goons so they ain't left yet. - Lucky for you, lamebrain, you know you could have made us late. - Sorry, I was really sleepy. - Shut up will ya, and take off that ridiculous cap. - Okay, get ready guys, here they come. - All four tires are blown. - You can relax Gordon, I've installed a self-repair kit. - The blown tire gag never fails. Let's get after them. - Look out Jack, that vehicle's headed straight for us. - This is a job for Boll. Go get 'em Boll. (whistle blowing) - Hey, what are you doing, stupid? - [Dog] Stop sign, have to stop. - Now, what's your problem? Get out and change it, hurry they're getting away. - Well come on Nitty, ain't we going after 'em? - The person in that car, ain't Bushy Siegel. - Well what makes you think that? - We got information that they're using a double, so the logical thing for them to do is to bring the fake Bushy Siegel out first. Do you follow me? - Come on, hurry it up, let's go. - Hey Scalezi, look over there. Hey wait a minute, that's Deborah's car, but what's she doing here? Come on, we gotta follow her. (dramatic music) - There's no one around, it's safe to get out now, Elliot. - Yeah, I doubt those hoods will try anything anyway. - Huh? Elliot Mouse? - Well, how can I thank you for all your help, Deborah? - How about a kiss, Elliot? - Oh yeah, sure, you got it. (whistling) Sorry Deborah, I gotta go, the train's about to leave. - He just (muffled crosstalk). He's using my Deborah to help him get the real Bushy Siegel to New Gruyere. No, my Deborah. I can't believe it. - Snap out of it, you lovelorn lug, they're getting away. - Last call for the Cheesecago Express, all aboard! - Come on, hurry, we're gonna miss the train. - What a minute, I can't go, I left my sleeping cab behind. - Come here. - I ain't going, nothing matters if I can't have Deborah. - Get on! Get on now. (crying) - Quit griping Nitty, this gives you more incentive to do the job right, and get your gal. - Yeah, well I guess you're right, I should take it like a rat. Okay come on, we'll shoot that copper. I'll finish him off if it's the last thing I do. - That's perfect, there's no one around, so we'll be able to change compartments. You just wait here and don't move. Aw shucks, it broke. This is no good, I'll have to go get the conductor. Well, looky here, it's the 326. At this speed, we're getting to New Gruyere before they do. - Excuse me, can I see your tickets, gentlemen. - Where's that conductor got to? - [Conductor] Your tickets please. - [Nitty] Hey want our tickets, here. - [Elliot] Hey, who turned out the lights? Oh, excuse me. - [Nitty] Get out of the way, you moron. - Sorry fella. Ah, there you are. Say, you all right? What happened to you? - Those punks, they attacked me for no reason. - It's him! - We got him, now he can't get away. Now, where'd he get to? - Here! - That wasn't very nice, mister. Hey I did it, I beat Elliot Mouse all on my own, yay! Wait a minute, no one else was here to see me do it, and what am I gonna do now? I'm all on my own. - I don't want to do that again in a hurry. Well, the 326 should be along any minute. Hey fellas, wait up, hey. - Elliot, hey what happened to you? - Let's say I met up with a couple of old friends. Luckily I got rid of Nitty and Scalezi, before I fell from the train. - Hey, does that mean they know about our plan, Elliot? - It would seem that way, Gordon, but it can't be helped, we can't waste any more time. Right now we've got to catch up with that train, and quick, our friend Anselme is still on board. - It'll be difficult to catch up. The route by road is longer. - There's still one other possibility, there's an aerodrome near here, they might be able to help us out, Elliot. - Good idea, let's get over there Jack. How's our passenger doing? - [Jack] Sleeping like a baby. - Hey, what's that? - It's nothing, it's just a dummy. - Hi ya fellas, glad we met up with you. - Hey, where did you two come from, huh? - Well, we were coming along in the train. - Well, it's like this you see, we wanted to get ahead of the Untouchables, and set up a trap for them, but before we could get anywhere, we fell off the train. - You fell off the train? That's funny. Enjoy your walk to New Gruyere, fellas. I'd ask you to come with us, but we're going after Bushy Siegel, and we don't want you animals tagging along. - Wait a minute, you guys are on the wrong track. You won't free Bushy Siegel without our help. - What rat face saying? - Bushy Siegel ain't in that car, and I ain't saying nothing else unless we come to some sort of gentlemen's agreement. You guys listening here? - All right, we'll take you, now cough up the information. - [Pilot] So you want me to catch up with the Cheesecago Express, and land you on one of its cars? It's an interesting challenge. - Will you do it? I'll pay you top dollar. - Have it on me, we're having a special on crazy stunts today. - You can't do better than that, Elliot. Good luck. - Okay, see ya. - Yeah, just like I told you, there's Elliot Mouse himself, the louse. And now he's gonna try and get back on that train, where he left Bushy Siegel. - Hey, take a look, Kevin, it's true. That can't be Bushy, he ain't got no hair. - You're right, he must be on the train, so what do we do now? - I know a guy at Cheeseville Station, I'll call him and ask him to hold the train until we arrive there. - Yeah, that be good idea. - Just let me know when you see that train you're after, my friend. To tell you the truth, my eyesight's not what it could be. - Huh? Ain't that dangerous? - [Pilot] The train's down there somewhere, isn't it? - Yeah, it's there. - Hey, it's one of them hairy planes with Elliot Mouse inside it. Now, I know what to do. - Hey, whoa, where did you learn to fly like that? - [Pilot] Now, according to my nose, we should be halfway down the train, son. So unbuckle your seatbelt and get ready to jump. - [Elliot] I'm ready. - Goodbye son, and don't forget to recommend me to all your friends now. - Made it anyhow, that guy's really dangerous. - Hey Mouse, well ain't you gonna say hi? - Hi and goodbye. - You can't get away, this is the end of the line for you copper. - Looks like I'm running out of train. Hey there's a tunnel coming up. - A close shave, but another one bites the dust. Let me get back to that compartment. - Cheeseville, the New Gruyere train will leave in two minutes. - Hey, looks like you're losing a lot of oil down here. - Really? Where from? - Here. - Two minutes was up a while ago. How come we ain't moving? Huh, not again. Why can't things ever be easy. Come on, this time you're coming with me. - What's the matter, why aren't you leaving? - We got problems. - Maybe I can help. There's no time to explain, can you get us moving? - Come on, hurry up, it's pulling away. - Fast as you can, engineer. Ah, they made it. - Now what do we do? We can't get through this way. - We can get to the locomotive along this walking board. Go and see if there's one on the other side, Loomis. - Board here too, but me not like ride iron horse. Ah, bad sign. - Got ya Mouse. - They ain't here. Where could they have gone? - You lookin' for me? You're through Nitty, throw down your weapons. I'm gonna take you in. - Bushy, good going. - Yeah, nice one. - No, it's me, you see Officer Catlamity. - Where's Bushy, huh? - They've taken him in the car. This idiot here gave me his Billy club, to defend myself from you, what a greenhorn. - I never trusted you, Catlamity. So I took the precaution of stuffing my hat to cushion any blows. All right, the party's over. - It's a stinky brown-smelling cheese grenade. - That's some fondue, huh? - Wait, the controls are gummed up, they won't work. We're headed for the city, we can't stop, we're going to crash. - Then we'd better unhook the cars to save the passengers, come on. - That's it. - [Elliot] Yeah, good work. - Well, Jack got here before the train. Well I guess that must be a through train. - Obviously, Catlamity's jinxing ability is greater than any of us realized. - Reunited at last, huh fellas. - Oh Elliot it's you, I'm so relieved. - Did I hear you say Elliot? Hey, are you the famous Elliot Mouse from the Untouchables, of Cheesecago? - Right, and we brought you Bushy Siegel as promised. - Of course he might look a little bit different. We had him visit the barber. - You stole all my hair. - Hey, there's someone in here. - With their dangerous journey now at an end, the Untouchables have once again fulfilled their mission. But some of the other passengers weren't so lucky. Officer Catlamity, Rat Nitty, Scalezi, Kevin Nines, Johnny Key, and Sharpnose Clark, were all carted off to prison. They forgot about Anselme, but he made his own way there. - That's Nitty and Scalezi in there, hey, wait for me, fellas. - [News Reporter] Catone was left alone in the ruins of his criminal empire. ♪ 'Cause I was hungry and cold ♪ ♪ And down to my really last dime ♪ ♪ The world's gone C-R-A-Z-Y ♪ ♪ The whole wide world's gone crazy ♪ (audience applauding) - Go ahead and enjoy yourselves my friends. With his henchmen in prison, Al Catone is in no position to disrupt the lives of the citizens of Cheesecago. But there's still a job to be done here, the fight against crime goes on, and it needs all the publicity it can get. - Are you saying you're asking us in the press to help you out, Mister Mouse? - I'm asking for everybody's help. Now if you'll excuse me for a minute gentlemen. - Hey, just a moment Mister Mouse. - Okay, that'll be it for now boys. I hope you got everything down all right. - Well, Deborah I believe we've got some unfinished business to take care of, wouldn't you say? - Sure, it's like you said, Elliot, you still got a job to do here. - This was true, there was much to be done before Cheesecago could return to normality, but the city's residents knew they could depend on four brave agents, whose skill and determination could get the job completed.
