CURFEW This isn't the way home. I've got a surprise for you. What is it? Guess. You're warm... Very, very warm. Kenya? What about the clinic? Serge will take over. I've never been that far. I have something to tell you. ...in the region, coastal towns will be most affected. The level-4 storm will bring strong winds of up to 200 km/h. For safety reasons, the A1 will be closed to traffic at the end of the day. I've found a hotel 50 km away. Paradise. You can think about something other than physio. There's a lovely view. Just what we need. I'll drive slowly. I promise. Darling... They're closing the roads. What are you doing? I don't want to ruin it. I'm going shopping. The mini-market is open. With luck, they'll have champagne. - I can go up on my own. - I'll come with you. - It's fine. I came down, I can go back up. OK. We won't let a storm beat us. Not leaving? I thought I was ready. But when I tried to get in the car, it all came back. That's normal. Come and see me on Monday. We'll talk about it. Are you going? I'd happily go for good. - But I'll start with the weekend. - Do I know him? No. I have to go. I've lots to do before I leave. See you Monday? - I'll take it up. - Thanks, Goran. - You're staying? - It looks that way. If you need anything, call me. Thanks. This isn't good. This isn't good at all. Lift available. Doors closing. Keep fighting, Valentine - Dr Petit? - Yes. Laurent. Laurent Fromentin. Elisa's husband. Valentine's physio. We met before. There's been an accident during the evacuation. The injured have been taken to the centre. - You need help? - Yes. - My car's here. I'll follow you. - OK. - I hope it's not serious. - I'll let you know. - OK. - Are you cross? No. Don't worry. Laurent said you hadn't left. - No. - Are you OK? Yes. Are you in pain? - It's the damp. - Shall I take a look? That's good. Your muscles are getting stronger. - You can keep going. - OK. You'll soon be able to go back to Paris. - OK? - Yes. Sorry. Is it the baby? It's just... he keeps kicking me. It's silly, sometimes I... I imagine how he'll be when he's 4. I can see his face. We hold hands, he jumps, and we have such fun. He's moving a lot. Want to feel? No, thanks. Sorry. Forgive me. It's fine. - Like some more tea? - Yes, please. This storm is crazy. The town is empty. It's scary. I'm pleased Alain is here. You've got Laurent, you're not alone. Sorry? I said it's good you won't be on your own. Yes, but Laurent will be working, I won't see him. What will our life be like? I can't even get into a car. Valentine, you nearly died. No-one thought you'd come out of the coma. No-one thought you'd walk. Give it time. Don't put yourself under pressure. Cool. Breathe. How long? How long will he wait? Alain loves you. How many men would drive 400 kilometres to see you every weekend? Answer. - Answer. - Hello? Alain. It's me. Come home. Something's happened. Alain? Shit... Going down. Doors closing. Shit! Anyone there? Hello! I'm stuck in the lift! Shit! Hello! Over here! Hello! Hello! I'm stuck! Are you OK? Thanks. Miss Valentine, you mustn't do that. What if the power had come back sooner? Was that you on the stairs? Yes, there's no-one else in the building. With these power cuts the fuses might blow. Everything's fine. It's over. You shouldn't go out. It's not safe. It's because I... I saw something. I heard a scream. We must tell... I have to go home. What scared you? I don't know, but I have to go. - Sorry. - I can stay with you, if you're scared. I'll be fine, honestly. Sorry. I don't mind. Shit! Darling! What's wrong? I couldn't hear you. Are you hurt? What's wrong? I was stitching a patient. What's the matter? Something happened to Delphine. - Delphine? - Delphine Berthot. That girl I meet. She lives opposite. The psychiatrist. I saw something. It was awful. What do you mean? What did you see? I saw someone attacking Delphine. Are you sure? Delphine Berthot, the "hot" psychiatrist. There's been an assault. Thanks for coming. How's it going? No more injured. For the moment. Shouldn't you be careful? Why? Should I? Delphine Berthot? Police. Delphine Berthot, are you there? Something's happened to her. We can't force our way in. She may need help. Let's sort this out. What are you doing? Carole, stop. Sorry, boss. There are provisions in the emergency plan. One states we can take action to help victims. The wardrobe's empty. No toothbrush in the bathroom. Was she leaving for the curfew? Yes. She was getting ready to leave, this evening. So what? I saw her fighting in the curtains. Maybe it was the wind. What do you mean? You think I imagined it? I'm looking at all possibilities. Don't worry, you were right to call us. - Do you have her number? - Yes, yes. Voicemail. It's the storm. Calls aren't getting through. Are you OK? I'm not sure. I saw... I saw something in the mirror. It's not that simple. Memory loss is a common protection reflex for witnesses. If you saw something, it'll come back to you. Once the curfew is lifted, we'll investigate fully. There you go. - Something wrong? - Are you the caretaker? She thought she saw an assault. Were you around? Yes. Did you notice anything? No. You mustn't touch anything. You can sign your statement when the storm is over. Bye, Valentine. Thanks for coming. I appreciate this isn't a good time for you. There won't be a good time this weekend. Maybe I shouldn't say this, but Valentine often comes to our house and she drinks quite heavily. That and the morphine... I know. Elisa told me Valentine was pregnant. She'd just found out. She won't be able to have children now. My wife is pregnant. I can imagine how you must feel. Listen, in my job, I see a lot of accidents and it can happen to anyone. She took it all. I was unhurt. It was an accident. It's not your fault. Thanks for what you're doing for Valentine. You're welcome. - Bye, doctor. - Bye. Let me do it. You rest. I'm not made of china. - Valentine, are you angry? - They don't believe me. They do believe you. Do you? Of course I do. You're stressed because of the storm. We all are. Including me. I didn't tell them everything. When I saw what I did out the window, I went down and I saw Goran. - He was in the corridor. - He's a caretaker. He had scratches on his arms. As if he'd been fighting. What? What is it? I saw him this afternoon. Poor guy... The neighbour's cat bit him. But I do believe you. This will help. Tranquillisers? I prescribe them for post-operative stress. I've taken my painkillers. It'll help you relax. Please stay indoors. Barricade your windows as best you can. We will be patrolling the area. The storm will arrive in less than 24 hours. Anyone remaining, please stay indoors. Barricade your windows as best you can. We will be patrolling the area. I'm going back. I have to go. I know. They need me. Of course. Be careful. Lock the door and don't let anyone in. OK. Didn't you hear what they said? - I'm right next door. - Come in. I was going mad on my own in the flat. And after what happened... Laurent told me. It's crazy. You must've been scared. I couldn't sleep. You don't look like you slept either. I'm OK. Well, I was throwing up all night. But I'm OK now. I fell yesterday. Could you look at my legs? That's normal. I'm compressing the muscle. You should be careful. It'd be stupid to ruin all this work. Avoid bending it too much, and stairs. Stairs, I know. I was going to watch a film. Join me? Why not? Anthropophagia? Nothing more fun? Cannibalus. I've seen it 3 times. Valentine, are you OK? The vase. Valentine, what are you doing? We can't go in. I'm sure I saw it. What is that? It proves I didn't imagine it. Delphine was attacked. The wind blew it over. And picked it up and put it in the bin? It could be association of ideas. You'd seen the vase at Delphine's. Maybe she broke it. No. I saw the vase fall over. I know I did. How can we be sure it's her vase? I don't know. Check for prints. The lab is 100 km away. They have other priorities. Why won't you... - We'll let them get on. - We're on our way. We have to go. 2 more people have ignored the curfew and been injured. Some people just won't listen. I'll see you home. I'll come with you. Will you be OK? Are you sure you're OK? I'm sorry. You're under a lot of pressure. Alain blames me. It's my fault we're stuck here. He's trying to be patient. And now with all this... I don't know why I'm telling you all this. I'm not mad. I saw her. I'm not mad. A car belonging to Delphine Berthot. Find the registration and put out an alert. Let me know when it's found. Hello, Mr Perrec. I wanted to ask you something. Do you recognise these photos? Did you take them? Can I come in? Sorry. Valentine... Mr Perrec knows something. He slipped these photos under the door. - Why wouldn't he talk to you? - He was scared. Of what? We need to find out what he saw. Valentine... We'll both go and see Mr Perrec. Mr Perrec? Mr Perrec, are you there? Mr Perrec? He took photos of everyone in the building. That's me when I arrived. A broken angel We can't get forensics in. We'll have to manage until the curfew lifts. It looks like suicide. Why would he do such a thing? He had Alzheimer's. This is given to advanced patients. That's why he took photos. Those shoes... I've seen them. I saw them in the mirror during the attack. Goran wears them. He was after Delphine. She told me she was meeting a man. He must have heard. OK. We'll check. He's not there. His things have gone. We've put out his description. He won't get far. Now, listen to me, Valentine. If Goran attacked her, he knows you saw him. So until we catch him, stay indoors and don't go out. OK. Thank you. Alain? I don't mean you any harm. Or anyone else. I loved her, you know. I was jealous, but I didn't harm her. I've searched for her everywhere. Something's happened. And now they're all after me. I don't blame you. Maybe I'd have done the same thing. I tried to talk to you, but the police were there. I shouldn't have disappeared. But I was scared. What will you do now? I'll leave town tonight. They'll find you. They've put out your description. I'll take my chances. I just came to say it wasn't me. And to tell you to be careful. Trust no-one. Be careful, Miss Valentine. Very careful. This is the voicemail for Dr... It's me. Where are you? Can you call me back, please? I'm worried. Call me. 4. There were 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Valentine! Darling... - Sure you saw nothing? - Yes, certain. Anything to identify him? He was wearing a hoodie. And you? I didn't see anyone. Only Valentine on the floor. What was on the photo he took? Delphine in bed with a man. What did he look like? I couldn't see his face. You were right, Mr Perrec must have photographed the killer. If you hadn't been there... It's just that... I couldn't sleep for the wind. I went down to the courtyard. To smoke a cigarette. That's how come I heard you. I should never have left you alone. No more taking risks. Don't go out alone. You've been warned. Normally we'd post someone outside, but with the storm... Otherwise you can stay in a cell. No, no... Absolutely not. I'll take care of her. If there's a problem, I'll tell you. You got there in time. I didn't believe you. - Not really. - I know. I should've listened to you. It's my fault. I made you stay here with me. You didn't make me. I like being with you. If I get my hands on the bastard... It wasn't Goran. If he wanted to kill me, he would have. Other than us, only Elisa, Laurent and the cop know I saw something. There must be an explanation. Did you go outside to smoke? Yes. Why do you ask? No reason. It's the clinic. I have to take it. Hello? I know. Calm down, I'll take care of it. I said calm down! Yes. This weekend. It seems they can't cope without me. I told them I'm with my lover and to leave me alone. It'll do you good. Are they tranquillisers? Are you hurt? What's wrong? I was stitching a patient. I went down to the courtyard. To smoke a cigarette. Valentine! Darling... Berthot It's Delphine. I got your message. I'll call you later. What are you doing? I heard a noise outside. It woke me up. It'll be an overturned bin. No, I think I saw someone. - Want me to go and look? - I just thought that maybe... Aren't you afraid for me? If there's a killer... What do you mean, "if"? You still don't believe me? I'm not leaving you alone. I'll lock myself in and watch you through the window. Valentine! How are you feeling? Why did you go out? You gave me a fright. I thought something had happened to you. What were you thinking? I don't understand. Are you scared of me now? Don't you want to talk to me? I was scared. I didn't see you go outside. I heard a noise on the stairs. You went out with that madman about? Here, take this. What is it? Valentine, stop playing games. There. Now try to relax. You'll be OK. I won't let you out of my sight. It'll be fine. I made breakfast with what I could find. I can't make tea. There's no heating, no electricity, nothing. Here, take this. I don't need it. I just woke up. Don't you trust me? Right... I'm going to take a nice cold shower to start the day. What are you doing now? You really must get some rest. I just wanted to get out of the room. Did you think I wouldn't find them? What are you playing at, Valentine? I don't understand you. You want to spend the rest of your life in that chair? Right. Back to bed now. Hello. Did you have any problems with the power cut? No. Everything's back to normal. Is your wife OK? Yes. She's had a shock. She's sleeping. Anything you need? No, thank you. No! She has pain in her legs. But I've given her some medicine. Right. I'll make up your injection. Hello? Hello. Delphine! I can't believe it! Alain! It's not possible. I'm going mad. I'm going mad! Calm down. Alain! Alain... I'll take care of it. Yes. Don't worry. Liquidated this weekend. What's got into you? - Keep back! - Valentine... Put that down. It's the tablets. Valentine! Valentine, open the goddam door! Open it! What are you doing? Valentine! There's been a landslide. Laurent gave you this in case there's a problem. - The baby's not due yet. - He worries. Elisa! He's been feeding me tablets for 2 days. I heard him talking to someone. He said he'd liquidate me this weekend. That's crazy. Why would he do that? I don't know any more. He lies and hides things from me. He's got huge debts. I inherited money. Maybe... Calm down. You're having... Sorry. There must be an explanation. He's there all the time, I doubt that he... It's not me he comes to see, it's Delphine! - That's not possible. - It is. I checked his mobile. They've been calling each other, and he pretends not to know her. - Why would he kill her? - She isn't dead. She isn't dead. I saw her cross the courtyard an hour ago. It's a set-up to make me think I'm mad, stuffing me with tablets to get rid of me... I don't understand. I don't know... You were right. Delphine Berthot is dead. We found her car at the foot of the cliffs. We're awaiting confirmation, but it seems she didn't die in the accident. There were strangulation marks. You were right. Stay here and don't open the door. I'll try to find your husband and keep you posted. OK. I don't understand. I'll put you in here. - You sleep in the spare room? - Yes, when I'm feeling sick. And Laurent doesn't sleep much right now. The toilet's in the bathroom, just in case. And I'll... I'll leave you a torch in case of blackouts. Elisa! Elisa, open up! Don't open it. - Please! - Maybe you should talk. You can't leave him like that. If Valentine's here, I want to talk to her! I don't know. With all that's happened, the drugs... You can't ruin your relationship over... suspicions. Open up, Valentine! Give him a chance to explain. Let me in! You can't leave me here! - I want to talk to you! - You're scaring me, Alain. You stuffed me with tablets! You lied! Of course I gave you tranquillisers. Remember the state you were in? What you did to me? How can you think I'd hurt you? Don't you know me? No! No, I don't know you. You lie! You... hide to make phone calls. Shit... Let me in, I'll explain. Right, OK. I have gambling debts. I gamble, there! I lost a lot of money. I have to pay back what I borrowed by this weekend. What about Delphine? What about her? Stop pretending you don't know her. I saw your phone. After the accident, the baby, I was afraid I'd lose you. You wouldn't see a shrink. You wouldn't talk to me. I asked Delphine to look out for you. I was paying her. I didn't know what else to do. Valentine, I'm soaked! I need... I need to be alone. I'm staying here tonight. I gave her that. Valentine said you and Laurent were sleeping apart. It's not been going well lately. Was he sleeping with Delphine? What happened? Did you go to see Delphine, to talk to her? Did you argue? Did you lose it? If I was dumped when pregnant, I'd have lost it too. Hello. This is Dr Alain Petit's voicemail. Leave a message after the tone. Alain, it's me. I'm at the police station. I'm sorry about before. Really I am. I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to say... The accident... wasn't your fault. Still nothing. Something's not right. It doesn't add up. Delphine Berthot's one thing. But why would Elisa try to kill you at Mr Perrec's place and not hers? The story about the red mac doesn't wash. And I don't like that. - Where is she? - In the cells. - You can't go in. - What is this? You know the procedure. She's my wife. Let me by. Exactly. This one's not for you. Who do you think you are? OK, I'll calm down. I'm calm. Carole... A guy's having a fit downstairs. - You go. - Carole... I'm not allowed. I have to talk to you. I'll be right back. No! No! No! Seen Laurent? - I just passed him. - With anyone? - I think so. - Where did he go? - Towards the cliffs. - Shit! Why didn't you give it up? Why? This is all your fault! Why... did you do it? You just don't get it! For Delphine Berthot What's she doing here? I asked the judge's permission. I thought it'd help her to talk. A psychological trigger. It's not Laurent in the photo. It was a woman with Delphine. She had a tattoo on her heel. I get it now. It wasn't Laurent having an affair with Delphine. It was you. I imagine you think it's your fault he killed her. But no-one forced him. He made the decision alone. I don't know what happened. Or how. I was married. I thought I was happy with Laurent. And... then there was Delphine. It was like falling in love for the first time. And... And then I... I got... I got pregnant. I didn't know what to do. I was desperate. And then... she asked me to spend the weekend with her. I was scared, but I said yes. I so wanted to be with her all the time. I wanted to be with her all the time. At least once more. I should never have told him. But he could tell. We argued. "What you've done is bad. "It's bad. It's not right." He left in a rage, slammed the door and... And I knew... I knew something was going to happen. I didn't do anything because I couldn't. I couldn't move. I wanted to warn her but couldn't. Why didn't you tell us sooner? Because it's my fault. It's because of me. Because I told him. And was it you in the courtyard in the red mac? He made me do it. He did it all the time. Wait a minute. You're not guilty, Elisa. Once the judge works it out, you'll be free. I promise. Go ahead. Subtitles: ECLAIR
