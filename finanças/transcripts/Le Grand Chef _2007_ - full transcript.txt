He wanted to show her that he could make the best charcoal. You crazy bitch! You can't run away from me! Come here, You bitch! No! Don't! Please! Stop it! No! Don't interfere in my life! Here's a home-cooked meal for you. The happiest time in my life was when I made charcoal. Although the hot fire slowly blinded me... It didn't matter. 'Cuz the one I wanted to see was always there in the flames. Thank you, Sung-chan. Your sweet potatoes melted away my resentment towards my mom. There is a tree near where my mom's house used to be. It's the most suitable wood I know of. The beautiful flames will turn it into the best charcoal. I wish you luck. It's amazing! This'll make the best charcoal ever! You'll never find a better tree than this! Let's rock and roll! Careful, it's hot! This is why HAN wanted to look at it even if it blinded him. Your sweet potatoes melted away his resentment. The best food in the world is equal to the number of mothers. Pretty cool saying, isn't it? I'm going into town, wanna come? Duk-gi burned his hand. Need anything else? Hurry back so we can celebrate. Who are you? What are you doing? Take the charcoal and run! Don't touch that! Drive. What happened? Are you okay? What happened? The charcoal's all ruined. I'm so sorry. We couldn't protect it. Now this is some charcoal. Look at that bright color. Let's have a taste. The meat's juices are most important. You need to cook it quickly over hot fire to seal in the juices. The juices are brilliantly sealed in. The scent of the charcoal on the steak is mouthwatering. It's the best! Birch tree charcoal, am I right? Bastard! You stole it from us! Let go! Duk-gi! What's with you? Aren't you angry? He's the one who stole it from us! It's obvious! Who says Where's the proof? Bong-ju is way in the lead now. If he doesn't catch up in the next round, he won't make it to the finals. What's the next round? Beef carving You wait and see! I'll make sure he pays! As you can see, our cattle is grown with the utmost care. Wide stables and pastures, red earth and salt on the floor... Sorry, forgot to turn on the camera. Man... It's on. As you can see, our cattle is raised with the utmost care. - Wide stables... - Sorry, battery's out. Battery... You're doing it on purpose, aren't you? It's working now. As you can see, our cattle is... - # look at me! - 'Look at me! ' Hello? This one looks pretty good. What exactly are you looking for? It's been days. We went through all the major markets. - Let's go eat. - Man... I wish I could see in your head. What is your perfect cow? A cow to your standards doesn't exist. You want something that doesn't exist! This is why you couldn't find the right cow. Why the heck did we trek all across the country? This is the best cow there is, man! Shut up. What did you feed her? Let's use this one. - Stop it. - This is great! What? It's perfect! What? Why? That's not a cow. What? Is it a pig? That's Sung-chan's baby sister. He raised her from birth like family. Could you slaughter your own sister? How can he? But it's just an animal. But to Sung-chan... Just drop it! Or else! Don't bring it up again! Got that? It's the brackens rain. When this rain falls, the boat out to sea can't return. When the brackens rain falls, it's time to say goodbye. You're the first thing I bought after leaving Woonam-jung. I needed someone to keep me company back then. She's a beauty, sir. Come here. Let's go. You fool! Go on! Cut it! We raised it all so dearly. It's nothing but a piece of meat. A good chef doesn't get attached to the ingredients! How can I butcher something I like so much? Why you! Where'd you get such crazy ideas! From your grandpa? I promise you. Your sacrifice won't be in vain. Finals - Beef carving He started on the neck bones. The neck should be stripped completely clean. The judges will announce the results. Chef OH, first place with a total score of 670. Sung-chan, second with a total score of 580. These two will advance to the finals. You should've taken my offer while you still could! Will the final contestants please come to the beef grading area. Who cares. It's over. Even with a perfect score, we won't win unless OH gets a zero. Hurry up and eat. I want to start home before rush hour. Damn it! Why are you so pessimistic? I'm being realistic, stupid. You wanna fight! Come on! Thanks for all your help, guys. Sure... The last contest for Royal Chef's knife shall begin. The final judgment will be on the amount and quality of the meat. Points will be awarded according to five different grades. Let the judging begin. Weight, size, percentage of fat... Grade A beef! Good job, Sung-chan! Excellent marbling and maturity, top grade! Go, boss, go! Meat color, no. 4 clear! Fat color, no. 3 clear! Mr. OH? Still undecided on the new stores? The competition's over. Make the calls. I already have. Go! Woonam-jung! Go! Now we will announce the final scores. Chef OH, 770 points. Sung-chan, 680 points. The new owner of the Royal Chef's knife is OH Bong-ju. Look here. Isn't it a muscle hemorrhage? Wait! Hold on! Wait! Hold on! See here? This is a hemorrhage. What the hell are you doing? It's a hemorrhage What! It can't be! We have a correction to make. A hemorrhage has been found in Chef OH's beef, so it is disqualified. - Alright! - Sung-chan! What are you talking about? You made a big mistake while transporting the cow. What the hell do you know? Cows are very sensitive animals. If they get stressed, hemorrhages will form. Damn it! Since we have a tie, another competition will decide the winner. Details on the final competition will be given later. I knew the Royal Chef's line of descent was broken, but I had no idea his grave was so neglected. It's shameful. But 'cuz he stood against Japan, his grave would be left neglected. I'm very sorry. My apologies... Do you know how the Royal Chef died? The last Royal Chef had two apprentices. But I heard that one of the two poisoned the Royal Chef. Poisoned him? Perhaps solving the mystery behind his death will determine his true successor. Mister? I have a question to ask you. Wait! Please! What do you want to know? I heard you've been here a long time. Do you know who killed the Royal Chef? Which apprentice killed him? Sung-hyun did. Sung-chan's grandfather. Why did he do that? Say it again. Who killed the Royal Chef? Say it again! Now! When King Soon-jong lost Chosun, he stopped eating in sorrow for his people. Then one day, the honorable Royal Chef made and offered up a bowl of beef soup for his king. And to his surprise, the bowl came back empty. According to the court subjects, King Soon-jong cried as he ate it. What soup was it that it moved the king to tears? All we know is that the beef soup has been passed down in secret. This is why we have chosen beef soup for the final round. We believe that the true disciple will exactly recreate the secret soup. Secret Royal Soup Who will carry on the tradition of the Royal Chef? And be the new owner of the knife? Best of luck to both of our finalists. I will not take part in this contest. Cut! Chef OH, what's with you? I'd rather quit than to disgrace the Royal Chef's honor. He was poisoned by an apprentice. The Royal Chef had two apprentices. One was my grandfather, who inherited Woonam-jung. The other was his grandfather. The Royal Chef was killed by Sung-chan's grandfather. I couldn't believe it... Stop making up stories, you coward! Go on Ms. KIM. Tell them. You knew about this? Is it true what he said? Are you resigning from the competition? No, I just refuse to cook. Are you going to give up the Royal Chef's knife? It's... Remember when I was kicked out of Woonam-jung? You made me your special beef soup. I was sobbing inside. Angry for being falsely charged, and sorry to you. I even resented you for teaching me to cook. I miss the beef soup you made me back then. I want ribs. Ribs? Make it for me. Okay, grandpa. Looks good, huh? Here. What's wrong? You said you wanted ribs. This is wrong. I want ribs. Grandpa, that's what this is. Buy it for me! Okay, if you eat this, I'll buy you ribs. Come on try just one bite. Ummm, yummy. What is he doing? He's making Secret Royal Soup for the contest on Independence Day. He's been at it for a week. Maybe he doesn't know the secret. Say something, old man. Didn't you wear this when you made it? Secret Royal Soup! What the hell is it! We're gonna keep the traditional taste. Rotten bastard. I heard the contest will be held on Independence Day. I decided it's best to finish the competition. More important than the contest, the Secret Royal Soup will be revealed. It will be a very meaningful day. Do you think Sung-chan will take to the challenge? I gave you ribs, ma'am. I didn't want pork, I want beef. But you said ribs. I meant beef ribs. Sorry, I thought you meant pork. Get it right next time. Please, make the noise stop! I don't want to hear it. Stop the banquet. Stop it. It must be stopped! 1926, just after death of King Soon-jong Adding Japanese flavor to Korean food makes a great combination. I will carefully protect the secret recipe. It's been passed down through generations in our family. Guard it well and give it to your descendants. I will, sir. I heard there is a beef soup that brought tears to the king. Will you cook it for our next banquet? His master made that for the king. Who is your master? The one I serve has past away. I have no reason to cook. I'll just drink in peace 'till I die. But it's a very important banquet. Sung-hyun! See that he gets some soup before he goes. What a refreshing taste. What's the name of this soup? He asks what the name of this soup is. Master! Master! The Japanese soldiers are here to force you to cook for their banquet! Please don't do this master! I have no use for my hands anymore! Master! What are you doing, grandpa? You're cooking beef soup? Great! I really missed your cooking... Grandpa? What's this? Did your mentor give this to you? Shouldn't we prepare some food for the guests? Why don't we just order it from here? I'll make it. It's the last thing I can do for him. I want to do it myself. I'll go buy the groceries. I need beef ribs. Bracken from Jeju Island... I'll make the pepper oil myself. Please get some oil while you're there. And the taro shoots... The taro shoots... This is not it! I want ribs! Grandpa... Is this what you were trying to tell me? That's what you wanted to teach me? Am I right? Master... That'll do... I want to rest in peace... No, master... Give me the wine. Let me rest in peace. I don't want to hear their celebration any longer. Please... Sung-hyun... Now, I can prepare a banquet for my king... Your majesty... Your majesty... Master! I'm so sorry... Although he had no choice, he felt guilty for his master's death, so he left Woonam-jung. And Man-sik the betrayer ended up becoming the owner of Woonam-jung. But Sung-hyun would've been the real Royal Chef. How can that happen? Does Sung-chan know? Sung-chan? Where are you? Call me when you hea this message. Yes, chief. Sung-chan showed up at the competition. - What? - Where are you? Get here, now! The Royal Chef's knife has a spirit. It searches for its rightful master. I will win to avenge the Royal Chef's death! Independence Day, Aug15th - Final Round And show you that justice will prevail. Soon the Secret Royal Soup making contest will begin. What was the secret soup that made King Soon-jong cry? I gotta go! Leave the shop open! But today's a holiday. If Sung-chan wins, we're giving out free food! Hon! Wait! Your pants! Let's see who will unveil the Secret Royal Soup. I heard a shocking story about Woonam-jung. Quiet. Tell me later. Mr. Fujiwara, who is returning the Royal Chef's knife, will also act as a judge. Let's start with Chef OH's beef soup. I made this with my grandfather's secret recipe. It is exquisite, a taste I've never come across before. Let's unveil Chef Sung-chan's beef soup. What's this? This is the Royal Chef's secret soup? It's a common, everyday soup, but it's grandpa's last gift to me. This isn't a market stall. Get that cheap soup out of here. The judges are taste testing. Let's wait for the results. What's going on? They're taste testing, but there's no response yet. Camera 1! Full shot on Fujiwara! Now I understand... ...why King Soon-jong was moved to tears. This beef soup contains every aspect of Korea. The long-serving cow is Korea's grass-roots democracy. The hot pepper oil is Korea's hot and lively spirit... The taro shoots represent a nation that does not submit to foreign power. The bracken is the vigorous life that spreads like wild grass. What the Royal Chef cooked for the King was not just simply beef soup. To the King who had lost his country, he demonstrated that Korea's spirit will live on. The king could read the Royal Chef's heart... And that's why he cried... It's hard to believe that a king would be so moved by a cheap bowl of soup. What proof do we have that this is Royal Chef's soup? My father said the name of the soup was Yuk-gae-jang. What's the name of this soup? What's the name of this soup? Yuk-gae-jang is correct. - Yes! Alright! - Any comments on Chef OH's soup? Tell me about that. It's delicious, but it's not something the Royal Chef would've made. You moron... Using fried bean curd and soy sauce is a Japanese tradition, not Korean. I'm actually stunned. This tastes exactly like a soup that's been in our family for generations. It's as if my mom came to life and made it for me. Camera 4! Go! What is he saying? I don't know how you learned to make it... But whoever gave you the recipe, probably didn't want it to be revealed. Because... it's a soup with both Korean and Japanese origins. This is absurd! The true descendant of the Royal Chef is Chef Sung-chan! Congratulations. You are the new owner of this knife. The great knife of the Royal Chef has finally found its owner. Please give a big round of applause to Chef Sung-chan! Alright! Free Food Today! Congratulations... How to eat the best ramen Eat it when you're hungry. P.S. You must be really hungry. - Hosung Four bowls for delivery! I'm here, mom! There's my son-in-law! Wait! Have some food before you go. I can't. Too many deliveries to make. More kimchi over here! My daughter will be here soon. That rotten girl... Maybe next time, mom. There she is. Let me introduce you two. My daughter Jin-su, and Sung-chan. Jin-su, Sung-chan? ' That means a great feast, doesn't it? I didn't realize that. Get me more rice over here! Go on, say hello. - Hello... - Ah... hi... Over here, please. Oh, yeah. Noodles for table five! Three noodles please! - Yes, sir. - Coming up. Have a great day. More kimchi, please. - Check, please. - Coming! THE END
