Adaptarea: Legendofmir Traducerea: DOOMNEZEU It was supposed to be a really good day. The best of days. The Germans had surrendered. The war was over. Or so we all thought. None of us were really that keen on the plane. You could tell. We all just wanted to be back at home with our families and our friends. Smiling and laughing, embracing strangers on the streets, cheering with all the crowds. That wasn't to be. We were given this last mission. It was supposed to be over. And then the sky erupted with all these explosions. These huge deafening crashes, and blasts. Did you hear that? - And the shouts of men. - What's going on out there? - Turning into screams. - Fuck! We're sitting ducks! Sounded, a bit like a war. A war that we were told was over. It was all finished. We gotta get out of here. And we were just going to clear it up. And we'd been sent right back into it. We're sitting fucking ducks up here! We gotta get out of here now! We gotta go! I don't wanna be here anymore! Why are they fucking shooting at us! Look who they fucking shot! I plummeted through the air, desperately tearing at my parachute. And I somehow woke up hanging from a tree. Plane had been shot down, but I was lucky. I could see the bodies of men, who had been sitting near me minutes earlier dead on the ground. Planes were still flying overhead. They seemed to be getting closer. I didn't know where I was. If I was in front or behind the line. But I knew I needed to get down, and quickly. I found my knife, and started to try to cut through the mess of cords tangled around me. And I managed to cut through them, and I fell again. And I landed on my knife. I grit my teeth, pulled it out. Fuck. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry, I don't understand. Come with your hands up. Drop the gun. - I'm dropping the gun. - Down on your knees. - Down! - Okay, okay! Okay. I'm just reaching in for paper. A letter, letter. - Come on! - Can you... Can you give it to my family please? Kid, get up! Kid, grab your gun, we have to go. - Who are you? - It doesn't matter. Grab your gun, we gotta go right now. Come on. Get up, go! Get down! Get down! You good? Your leg, you're good? Yeah, yeah, flesh wound. Be quiet. Grab their ammo. He had a pretty little wife. We should get out of here. We need to keep moving. - You alone? - Yeah. Hopefully there are others. But we need to get out of here, before more germans come. Oh they're already here. They're looking for you not me. You trying to get yourself killed back there? Thank you for saving me. What are we gonna do with the two of us? Probably 100 Germans out here. Maybe you can't do anything but I can. If you don't wanna fight, just go. You gonna kill every Kraut by yourself? Every one of these german bastards I kill, means one more of our boys gets to go home. We don't know where we are, or how many germans are looking for us. You. They're looking for you. You think they won't kill you too? I'm gonna get every one of these pricks. They wiped out my unit, my brothers. They wiped out yours too, or did you already forget that? We need to get going. They're looking for one soldier, not two. So I'm gonna stay and I'm gonna kill, as many of these Krauts as I can get my hands on. Great. Suicide mission. You Yanks have to be heroes. Are you going to stand there or are you gonna help me? Thanks for helping me out back there. You mean saving your life? Yeah. Saving my life. But now I'm going. Good luck with all the killing. You don't wanna go that way. I'm fine. This is why I'm gonna kill as many, of those assholes as I can. Some of them might still be alive. - We gotta help them. - They're all dead. - How do you know? - I checked 'em. - One was alive, barely. - You sure? I'm not an idiot. Then why didn't you save him? There's nothing I could do. He just stopped breathing. It could've been me. Yeah. Well it wasn't. You take a good look at 'em. 'Cause they slaughtered us like fucking cattle. And if we stay here we'll get slaughtered too. I said you can go. These men were my friends. So maybe now you understand. Why do you have a death wish? I see you motherfuckers. Don't creep up on me like that. I could've killed you. What makes you think I wouldn't of killed you? I told you to go. They're all dead. You're the only one out here. We need to work together. You want 'em dead, I get it. I don't wanna kill anybody, but I'll do what I have to. Is your gun loaded? I never actually killed anybody. It's easy when you got a reason. I got a reason, so do you. Yeah. We gotta take 'em out. If they find those bodies, we're gonna have the entire german army on our ass. Yes. What's the plan. I'm gonna circle around behind them, you're gonna stay here and keep cover. Remember why you're doing this. My letter. Where did you get that? Dropped it on the road. Thank you. My name's Sydney Baker. William Summers. Down. Get in there. What? They didn't hear anything. You're insane. You're gonna bring them right to us. Shut up and cover me. Gustav? Stay there. Shoot him! I don't understand you. Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Do you speak German? A little. Like thatguten tag shit? I know that. Guten tag? Shut the fuck up. English. Do you speak it? Do you understand what I am saying? He has no idea, he's a dumb fuck. - We can still use him. - He's useless to us! What's the matter with you? We could of used him to get out of here. This is war. You really think he would've let you live? We gotta move. - They'll of heard that shot. - Yeah, a shot you didn't have to make. There's probably germans surrounding us, in every direction now. Look's that way. I know you don't wanna live, but I would like to go home and see my wife and child. Stop deluding yourself. You're not gonna make it home. This was always a suicide mission. - We can both get out of here if we're smart. - Look, I told you to leave. So if you want you can just go and find... - What was that? - Dogs. - Did you see a dog with this group? - No, it must be a different group. They don't give up do they? Well that's why we kill them, and don't take 'em prisoner. Move, move! Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute! I've gotta fix my leg. If those dogs catch up with us we're done. Here. Let me. Think of your little girl. You good? Thank you. Go on. What are you doing? I have an idea. You keep a lookout. What was that? I'm getting the dog off our back. Go. Go, go, go! It worked. Yeah. You killed a dog. Hopefully. I like dogs. This one would have torn you to pieces. Probably. You think we got them all? Well if it didn't it distracted them. We gotta find a place to rest, it's gonna be dark soon. You don't wanna carry on through the night? No, it's pitch black out here at night. You can't see anything. We don't have any lights, we won't know which way we're heading. Do we know which way we're heading now? Like I said, it'll be dark soon. We don't do we? How long you been married? Just over a year. A picture. She's a beauty. They both are. What I wouldn't give to be at home with both of them now. What are their names? My wife's Irene and my daughter's Mary. Sounds like you got the perfect little life back home. I do. Well it was going to be. Mary was born just a month ago. I got leave for the day. Got to hold her, and back to maneuvers. You'll see 'em again. Maybe. You will get home and see 'em again. You hear me? What about you? What about me? Any girlfriend, wife, back home? I mean you must do something else other than kill people. I'm not a killer. I'm just doing my duty. Yeah, I yeah know. - I didn't mean anything by it, honestly. - You know what I was before the war? No. I was a mechanic. I fixed things and put 'em back together. I didn't... I was just trying to kill people who were tying to kill me. If I didn't do what I did back there, you'd be dead too. I was a train engineer. I was good enough for the effort until now. Maybe you should try and get some sleep. Yeah. Well go ahead and try. I'll take first watch. - Did you hear that? - Yes. Stay down. I can't see anything. Neither can I. But they might hear you, be quiet. Movement dead ahead. I see 'em, you stay here. Wait, wait, wait, just let them pass. I can't, they're setting up camp. - How many do you reckon? - I see 3. Make that 4, 2 o'clock. Shit. He's heading this way. Grab me the bag behind the tree. What bag? Shit. What are you doing? Hold this. Don't lose it. No. You sure this is the best plan of action? You ready? Let's go. Klaus? Klaus? Klaus? Klaus? You really are insane aren't you? Get this shit off me! Why did you wait so long to shoot? I had to wait for the right moment. - You did great. - Thanks. Let's not do that again. You're gonna be exposed. Keep your eyes open. What happened? Get out of here! Go! Get up, go come on! Get up! Baker, come on, we need you! Baker, don't do this right now! - Come on! - I can't! I can't! - Baker you can't do this right now! - I can't! I can't! I can't! I can't do it! Think of your little girl! I shouldn't be here! Motherfucker! Get up! Up! Come on! Listen! Listen to me! When I tell you to run, run! Got it? You got it? Run! Summers, Summers we gotta go. What's wrong? You're fine, you're fine, you're fine. You gotta go. You gotta come with me. You're killing them all remember? I'm not gonna make it. I got a family. Can you, can you, can you get this to Sarah? Can you tell her I tried? I tried real hard. And my boy. Get this to my boy. His name's Jake. You tell him I tried. You get home to your family. I was in the middle of God knows where. No, even he didn't know. Alone, exhausted, with the single thought of trying to get back. I was wanting to curl up in a ball and give up. But I put one boot in front of another, and another, and then... Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. I leave. I'll leave, I'll leave. Just let me go. Drop it or I'll shoot! Do you have a family? I have a family. Drop it now! Nobody has to get hurt anymore. Let's both put our guns down. You really wanna do this? You made me do it. I didn't want to. He didn't leave me any choice. And I think that was you. And I think. Thank you. A gun shot in all that silence. I went as fast as, I could to escape to get out of that damned forest, to get us home. I came across this barn. I, I talked to a horse. Boy. You're a good horse aren't you? You have no idea what I've just been through. Well maybe you do. I almost gave up. I did. But my friend, he, he told me not to. A bit of pillar really. And the owner came in and I readied myself. I thought I was going to die again. But this man, this barn owner, he hid me. He grabbed me and he hid me. This Dutch barn owner. These two Germans came in and they must of tracked me. I was never as good at this as you. And then he managed to get the soldiers to leave and fly after a ghost. Thank you. Are you all right? They will never surrender. What is your name? I'm Baker. Engels. You can rest. Are ya hungry? Hungry? Eat? Yeah, yeah I am. And then he fed me. He put me up in his home. And when the war was over, when it was finally finished, when the fighting had actually stopped, he got me back to Britain. I owe two people my life. A stranger of a dutch barn owner and you. An american soldier. The best of men. Private William Summers. I wanted to come and see you, for years. But after the war, I was terrified of flying. This is the first time I've left England. I tried to contact your family. I really did, I tried. Promise. I brought my family. My little girl, grandchildren, and I had a son. He's here too. I know I haven't got much time left, and it's only because of you that I'm here at all. Thank you, for giving me my life. Not a day goes by that I don't think about what you did for me. You gave me the courage to fight, when I didn't think I could. Thank you, my brother. May you rest in peace.
