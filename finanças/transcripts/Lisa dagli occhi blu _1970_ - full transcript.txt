Good morning. The 2 B direct train has arrived. Why did you open the window? - What are you doing? - We're getting some air. Hurry up. The bell will ring in a bit. - Who put these flowers here? - I don't know, principal. - Nobody ever knows anything. - They are so nice. They remind me of hippies. In times of protest, the less I see them, the better I feel. I can't stand hippies anymore. Devoted... Good evening! What is it? Omar Sharif. You are the principal of our dreams! This is hippy stuff. What did I say? Well? What's so funny? Is this "Canzonissima"? - You committed an unworthy action... - Yes. You be quiet. ...In our institute. If that's the principal of your dreams, I'll kick you all out! Yes, because I can't stand Omar Sharif. - And Crisafulli eats. - She always eats. Crisafulli, come here. Put down that roll. Go to your place. The person responsible, take one step forward! - Are they being funny? - Always. I said the person responsible take one step forward. - The usual Prandi. - Don't get upset Agenore. I did it. - You? - Yes. - You? - Yes, yes. - Did you call me by name? - It's the fashion, more "in". - More? - In style! Then go out! It's more out. Suspended. Supermilan. S-U-P-E-R-M-I-L-A-N. Go far away, to Paris with the highway, to Berlin with the subway. Supermilan. S-U-P-E-R-M-I-L-A-N. Every day Milan gets bigger. It keeps growing and becomes this city. It widens here, moves out over there. It pulls you up, it pushes you down, Milan! Supermilan. S-U-P-E-R-M-I-L-A-N. Slowly, slowly. You mix up Montemerlo with the Pincio and the canals with the Po. Go far away, to Paris with the highway, to Berlin with the subway. Supermilan. S-U-P-E-R-M-I-L-A-N. Supermilan. S-U-P-E-R-M-I-L-A-N. Slowly, slowly. You mix up Montemerlo with the Pincio and the canals with the Po. Go far away. To Paris with the highway, to Berlin with the subway. Supermilan. S-U-P-E-R-M-I-L-A-N. S-U-P-E-R-M-I-L-A-N. Lisa, I'm repeating to you that if you're suspended again, I'll have you put in a cloister convent as in the 19th century. Since I've become a father, I believe it was a good century! They slapped children and they went to bed without fruit. - That's nonsense, Daddypooh. - Don't call me Daddypooh! You get nervous about anything and must take tranquillizers. - Why did you stop? - We're at San Maurilio Institute. Bye, Dad. Don't bother, Giovanni. Don't ever bother! You don't open the door for my daughter, the car is dirty. What kind of driver are you? - Hi, girls. - Hi. - Is there a movie? - They'll be showing docus. They could've shown "Doctor Zivago". Wake up. We will watch a movie! Did you do math? Good girl. - Who is he? - He's from the Space Center. He's the added science professor. - He's so cute that I'll diet. - Eat this too. Girls, to you places. Miss, will you close the windows, please? The first documentary of this course, will be dedicated to rocketry. Silence, please! - He's cute. - Rocketry is the future. The value of the first steps that humanity took on the road of science that brought outside the Earth, is important. Do you have a match? - Do you smoke? Miss... - Lisa Prandi. And you? - You know you can't smoke in class? - You lit it for me. You asked me for a match and I... You thought I wanted to set fire to the class so you gave it to me. Enough. Put out the cigarette and be quiet or I'll send you out. I'm scared! Ok. I'll behave. There's a movie so class is better. The documentary was shot by NASA technicians. - Is it Saturn 5 or 6? - It seems like Saturn 6. You're cute! So! The first space in steps... The steps space in first... I mean... The first steps of man in space... Is he a rocketry professor? Let's go to the heliport to see him. The list of your titles and references are the best of all. The Space Experimental Center needs young people like you. - Thank you, sir. May I hope? - Certainly. You have top quality titles. Degree in Electronic Physics, 110 with honors and academic praise. Assistant to Professor Calcabrina at the University of Pisa. Professor at San Maurilio Institute. I'm not a regular professor there. I'm just a substitute. - So the title of professor... - It's temporary. In order to obtain it, I must hope for some professor to get ill. You won't need it anymore. I confirm that you are astronaut student number one. - Am I hired? - Yes. - Beginning now? - No. You will start next month. Astronaut students don't have a salary in the beginning. - Their expenses will be paid later. - Thank goodness! At this point you'll take the helicopter test at 300 meters. - Who? - You. Aren't you happy? - I never piloted a helicopter. - Don't worry. I will pilot it, remote control, with these devices. The other apparatus will tell us what your reaction will be, your reflexes and your condition. - Will I be alone? - As alone as a hermit. - Among the clouds. - You must not worry. Imagine being in an armchair at home. You can do what you want. Tie your shoes, simple actions with total indifference. - Did you call, sir? - Take him to the flight field. He will do the helicopter exam. Thank you. Man alone in the mirror. What are you doing there? You look like me. You look like me. I was going in the wind at 200 an hour with red eyes, red from crying. I run home, I close the door. What do you care if I'll cry? Turned up nose, you're no longer here. I'm already history for you. I'll erase your lipstick even from my heart, turned up nose. Wonderful! I told him to be serene, and he's actually singing! Man alone in the mirror, what are you doing there if she's gone? If she's gone? You were hiding behind another man, but I saw you. Yes, I saw you. And this defeat burns. What a tight house without you. Turned up nose, you're not here anymore. I'm already history for you. I'll erase your lipstick even from my heart, turned up nose. You already belong to someone else, turned up nose. Hi, Mario. Are you busy? I found a job for us. - You always think of everything. - We'll sell the encyclopedia "Mayer Und Mayer". One million copies, 20% to us. - Is it easy? - Yes. Get on. Are you there? - Let's go. - Go! - No! - Madam, let us speak at least. - Don't make me waste time. - We offer something indispensable. The only indispensable thing is money. - With a modest amount... - You'll get an encyclopedia. - My husband can't even read. - What does he do? - Telegraphist. - How does he do it? - What do you mean? - That I'm fed up with you! Mr. Bramieri! We looked for you everywhere. Here too? Or at the park? We're here to offer you an encyclopedia. - It's complete with everyone. - If Milva isn't there, I'm interested. - They are 187 volumes. - 800 pages per volume. - 400 colored pictures. - Rice paper. Chinese stuff! They are 187... Plus one updating a month. Twelve volumes a year. In 10 years, 120 volumes. - Sure. - In thirty years, 360 volumes. Plus 187... That's 546. Wow! To buy it we must knock down the wall to make a big bookshelf. How much do you want for not selling it? Good morning, dears. What a villa! Money comes out of their gate. We'll sell our encyclopedia here. You'll be a German professor. Germans in Science have always been successful. - I don't know how to be a German. - How do you know? Open your eye. Say "ja" and ring. Seven! 7 and one is 8! - "Scopa" with 4! - Scopa? - It's not Scopa with 4! - And this? - It's a 5. - Scopa! What? Are you stupid? You're a Martian! You want to cheat me. Seven and one is eight. The 7 of diamonds is mine! - 5, 4 and 3 is 12. - This? Scopa with 5! You always do Scopa with 5! You are a cheater! I won morally. Shall we play another game? I think the villa is uninhabited. There must be ghosts. Come on! Are you scared? Go on. Ring! Again? Ja! You make me laugh. They're ringing at the gate. Go open. I won't go. If it's a Carabiniere, I won't go. - Are you wanted? - I won't go. - Go open. - I won't go! Open. You are the butler! I'll throw the apple in your eye! Go open. Let's do odd or even. Who loses, goes and open. There. Like this. Put your fist like this. Odd and even? Ready? - Hello? Who is speaking? - I'm Agostino. Play with the phone? You are... Did you get sunstroke? - What should I do? - Come on. Ask! - What should I ask? - You must ask for odd or even. - Odd or even? - Odd! Show me. What is it? Odd. One, two and three. You open the gate. Did I lose? Darn it! Let's do it again. Let's do it again. - You won't fool me! - You don't trust me? Wait, wait. Question. I ask. Odd or even? - Even! - Show me. - What did you do? - Even. One and two. Go open. Darn it! Idiot! He's really stupid. - Let's go. Nobody is here. - Calm and patience. Remember. - My gosh! - Did you ring? - Yes... - What do you want? - We wanted to talk to the owner. - You can't come in or talk. - We must... - Entrance to beggars is forbidden. Go away, beggar! Go away, scoundrel! - Come in, gentlemen. - Thank you. - Forgive him. He's an idiot. - A relative? He's my twin brother. Do the gentlemen have an appointment? German? - What? - I'm polyglot, unfortunately. - What? I know Russian, Polish, Czech. Agostino, accompany the gentlemen to the villa. - First I'll finish the solitaire. - Were you playing? I'm playing a solitaire to see if destiny helps me. Destiny won't help you, loafer. You'd like it to kick me here! - Please get in the Ranger. - Ok. I'll accompany them. An ex runner from Monza must drive that cart! I won 7 races. You should know! He's upset with me. My dear! Come here. Don't make me run. My foot is delicate. Ingrown toenail! I'll close you in an orphanage, you brat! - You've driven a long time? - Ten seconds. No. I meant if you've had a driver's license a long time. I never had a driver's license. I drive by instinct. - No hands! - No! Help! The car has gone crazy! It won't stop! - How do you drive? Be careful! - Are you drunk? I don't understand a thing anymore. Fortunately I'm insured! - My gosh! Every man for himself! - Help! You should drive a buggy, a horse, a mule! The pool! I can't swim! Help! Good! A gypsy had told me. "Agostino, you will be a scuba diver one day." The car! - Careful! - It's coming at us! Help! - Run, Mario! - Run! Run, Mario! Hurry! Hurry! What do you want? Help, Mario! You want to hit me? Stop! Oh, gosh! - It stopped. - Who was driving it? I don't know. Either me or Martians. - Who is he? - Did I scare you? It's the automatic pilot. I want to put it on Dad's Mercedes. I wonder how funny it'd be in traffic! Instead of sending him to the office, I'll send him to Switzerland. - Daddypooh wouldn't notice. - Good. Electronic stuff. What car does Dad drive? Mercedes? Very good. - Talk to him in German. - Where is your daddy? - Where is this famous professor? - Madam! May I? Professor Von Graghen of the Catholic University... - German from Innsbruck? - No, Munich. Cote d'Azur! Do you know Grace? Ranieri? - No. Munich. - Oh! Do you know Hitler? - Actually... - It doesn't matter. What matters is that you're a professor. I'll be right back. Madam. Imbecile! I didn't want to be a German professor. Don't worry. German always works. This is a cuckoo's nest. Oh, God! A bulldozer in my room? This stuff even in bed! No. I don't want to see it! My God! A bulldozer in bed. Is it possible? There's a bulldozer! It's not here anymore. It's gone. Coco? Coco? There was a bulldozer in bed. My dear. Listen, Coco? The phone. I'm coming! Hello? Who is it? Gino, The German professor has arrived. The German professor? Yes. Have him come. It left. No. Don't send him away. Have him come. The bulldozer left. Coco... - Please, follow me. - Certainly, miss. - Enrico, I'm the professor! - Go. She'll stay with me to show me the house. - I must accompany the professor. - Come with me. - She'll accompany me. Oh, yes. I'll stay alone. If I'd known... Sir, Professor Von Graghen is here. Yes, yes. Come. Come in, Professor. My life is a nightmare! I, Gino Prandi. Edil Moderna, an enterprise on the Stock Market. All construction needs. "A house for the future. A house for every Milanese!" I'm a human wreck. Life gave me everything. Joy, honor, riches, family, physical appeal. - I look like Marlon Brando. - Actually... If you didn't notice, it's ok. You didn't notice. Do you have a cigarette? I can do it! I can do it! I'm sorry. Coppi is about to win... Do you want a cigarette? Smoking is bad for you. It's terrible. Sorry. I don't do it on purpose. I'm ready for the nuthouse. Everything began 2 years ago. After a day of intense work I went to bed. I turned around to wish Coco goodnight. Coco is my wife. One evening I turned around and instead of my wife's face know what I found on my pillow? A brick. A tile! You didn't understand. A tile... Forget it. I was nervous, took tranquilizers, called the doctor. Poor Coco. She took tranquilizers too. They say to take them without water. You can't without water. After all the cures, injections, pills, I don't see the brick, but a bulldozer on my pillow. Huge, enormous! A bulldozer, Doctor... Sorry if I called you doctor. Professor, do you understand? From bricks to bulldozers... Ouch, my arthrosis! What should I do? Save me! Save me! - I don't know. - You don't know? I called an outside specialist, not the State doctor that costs 2,000 Liras a visit! You're German! When your bill will come, if I don't take a tranquilizer I will have a stroke, and you don't know? I'm a professor in Nuclear Physics. I wanted to explain to your wife. She didn't let me speak. You can't speak with her. I can't speak either! Coco! You're embarrassing me with the German professor! Coco! It's just a few meters to the finish line. Coppi is disqualified. Remus wins, followed by Romulus. Coco? Why didn't you say he's a Nuclear Physics professor? You send them in the room without advising. I thought he was the German psychoanalyst. He was to come from Nuremberg. Are you still here? - We lost. - You didn't you tell the lady? Coppi had almost reached the finish line. - Coppi? The cyclist? - No. A horse. Horseracing, dear. Is Coppi a horse? Those horse people don't respect anyone. - Disgracing the honored name! - He runs fast, sir. - You should've seen him on Ghisallo! - No. He runs on flat land. - Even the lady... - Horseracing is exciting! Tomorrow I'll go to San Siro and order a stock of thoroughbreds. - Very good, Mrs. Coco! - You encourage her? All I need are horses with white socks, and I'll go crazy! There's a bulldozer in the room, a Nuclear Physics professor comes... The Nuclear physicist has a bomb hidden in his bag! - There's no bomb in the bag. - No bomb in there. So much fright for a few firecrackers. I'm trying the new electromagnetic field converter. - Daddypooh gave it to me. - You too? You'll make me die. - Take him away. - Don't worry, dear. Ginetto, don't bother Dad. He's confused enough. - See you later for the horses. - Of course, Countess! - My wife isn't a countess. - Let's go back to us, sir! We come from the Mayer Und Mayer publishing company of which Professor Von Graghen is a valid representative. Our encyclopedia... - Has he become mute? - Professor! You're here? - Since when do you see Germans? - Germans? German? Oh! The German is Professor Von Graghen, from Mayer Und Mayer encyclopedia. - Is it Carnival time? - Where are you going? He's interested! He's interested! He is! I don't care about the encyclopedia. He put his glasses on! Professor Bongiovanni sells encyclopedias. Always the same jokes. - Professor Bongiovanni is coming! - The chicken is mine! Good morning, Professor. You can sit down. - Would you like some? - No, thanks. - Will you fix the screen? - "Ja, mein professor." - It's not a German lesson! - We can't say it, huh? - Has the cold gone? - Yes, thanks. Go to your place. Today, before the screening, I'd like to talk to you. About the Mayer Und Mayer encyclopedia with installment payment. Some experiments were done on the Cameroon fauna. - Cameroom with bathroom or not? - With bathroom. What do you want? Go, go! Miss, either eat or go out. Hurry up. The more you remove it, the more dust forms. This poor owl has no more feathers, he's been cleaned so much. This tail is all plucked out. - Good morning, blondie. - Lisa, finally! - Hi, Luca. - You can't always make me wait. - Professor, did you see Castellozzi? - Yes. He dresses like a redneck, but he has a lot of money. I found you a job for tonight. 12,500 without deductions. - A small club... - I don't want to sing anymore. - I have a Nuclear Physics degree. - How will we pay the rent? - You bet the money on horses! - I tried. If it'd gone well, you wouldn't sing. It went badly, so you sing. I found you a fantastic stage name! - Hi! - You're here! Where're we going? Not in the usual places with kids full of money. Lisa, you prefer proletarian kids with big muscles and sideburns? - There's "La tavolaccia". - Can we eat there? - You always think about eating. There's a terrible dance hall where every evening Aunt Polly... - Aunt Polly? - Yes, the police for brawls. - It's full of southerners. - I like fights! Let's go. - If they'll fight, I'm leaving. - We have nothing to do with it. - Come, Lisa. - No, you first. - Me with Luca? How exciting! - Funny! Population, Milanese and surrounding people, southerners, Swiss from Lugano and Chiasso, don't make noise. I have the honor presenting in Milan, my city of birth, where I grew up, an international number, coming from worldwide triumphs! He sang in Brooklyn, at the New York Music Hall, At TBC of London, the great Italian-American singer Bob Giuliano! Chord! He'd like to tell us many things. He's very excited and so am I, so I asked what he'd sing. He'll sing... - "Red Moon". - No. It's old. He's modern. - He'll sing... - "Pompadour". He's a modern singer. Bob, sing what you want, but sing. When the room is full, it's very acoustic. Go for it. - Agent! - What do you want? - You said he'd attract many people. - Don't worry. In due time. - Time is money. - I know! Is there a phone? You only had a flower in your hair and a little girl's sweet smile. You blushed if while we danced I held you tighter, little girl. Hello, Cesena? Did De Gaulle arrive? Yes, De Gaulle. He didn't arrive. I knew it! He never arrives. - He's important. - I'll call Rome. - Please, hurry up! - I will. Who are you? You're not my little girl anymore, because you're a woman as many others now. Who are you? With your make-up, I don't know the color of your eyes. Your skirt is well above your knees on the legs of a little girl. Your lips covered with lipstick to show you're not a little girl. Who knows where you threw that simply colored dress, little girl. In becoming a woman you're not naive anymore. Who are you? You're not my little girl anymore because... - Is Sinatra there? Making a fuss? - He always sings the same songs. - It's a quadruped! - Does he have four legs? - Give me the advance. - I don't have cash. Money is coming! Hey! Ciccio! Please, you'll dance later. Good evening. Good evening. Please, sit down. Your eyes! Who are you? You're not my little girl anymore because... Something modern now! I met a girl... Professor, will you sing a waltz? I never saw anyone more beautiful... - I'm leaving. - Hey! Giuliano! Giuliano! - What happened to you? - I'll explain later. I'll report you for moral, material and spiritual damages. - Talk to De Simone. - Agent! De Simone! You can't do this to Pasquale. I have a lawyer. - What are you doing? - Looking for a number. You and Giuliano are swindling me. I have a lawyer. - I have a sure horse. - Go away. Get lost! I'll confiscate your instruments! The reaction of the nuclear cells on the African fauna didn't bring mutations. She just had a flower in her hair and a sweet smile of a little girl! Get out for the entire lesson! - Professor... - I said out. I wanted to talk about a docu. "The Secret life of Bob Giuliano". Out. Silence! Crisafulli, you go out too. Ladies, you are witnessing Crisafulli's meal. I mean... The jaguar's meal. Hold the rope tightly. Ready with the firecrackers? Let go! It must stay at the height of the principal's window. That's it. Good! Good morning. Light it. With the blast the principal will look out the window. It's unheard of! I can't believe it! - I'm sorry, Professor. - Good girl. Nice joke! The projector and documentary are destroyed. I must pay for them. I'm sorry. It's my fault. I take full responsibility. 800,000? I said 800,000. 800,000. I call. - Is a 7 enough? - I don't think so. Two aces. - I knew it was a bluff. - What lousy luck! It's that monster's fault. It looks at me like that. How can I win? Antonia? I'm sure it brings bad luck. I've hated it for years. Antonia? - Mommy? - What is it? It's you, honey. - Will you give me 30,000 Liras? - Is this the right moment? I'm losing and you ask for money? Now that I'm already losing? - I'll stay and bring you good luck. - Look at the baron's cards. - Did you call, madam? - Take that cross-eyed away. Throw it out the window. It brings bad luck with those eyes. Ok, as you wish. Give it to Peppino. Tell him to throw it out the window. You too. - I must jump too? - Dear, don't be silly. Don't make me nervous. Go out. Peppino? Peppino! Peppino? Mr. Peppino. Illustrious Peppino. I don't even need to say it. So... Clean it. There's a spot. Don't go around like this. Well? - Madam sends this to you. - What should I do with it? She says to throw it away or sell it to someone. I'll go on the street saying: "Want to buy the painting"? In my room there's a humidity spot. I'll cover it. Let's go. Come on, quick! You've another spot there, on your rear end. If I am late with delivery, the banks won't give me credit! The contract gives millions. I need 300 million for cigarettes! - Come here. - Why are you whistling? I'm sorry. I'll come immediately. Why are you whistling? If with 300 million you light cigarettes, give me 30,000 Liras. Are you crazy? Are you kidding? With 300 million you light cigarettes and can't give me 30,000? You're awful. The workers are right in hollering "Death to capitalists". - They're right? - Yes. You're just an industrial. Out, degenerate daughter! "Death to capitalists"? Superman, would you make an exception to your stinginess? Lend me 30.000 Liras. I'll give you back 40,000. - I can't today. I'm upset. - Chocolate indigestion? I'm intoxicated. I don't want to even put the helmet on. I'm through as a scientist. - Can you lend me 30,000 Liras? - No. Why? - You're not intoxicated. - Yes, but not stupid. - 30,000 Liras is enough. - I don't have any money! The bank is closed. I can't, Lisa. My Carmelino, always peeling potatoes? Always peeling potatoes. I know you. When you say "My Carmelino", you just want money and I don't have any. I created this geranium. I called it "Geranium de Bergerac". I'm bright! Yes, and my compliments on how you pruned the hedges. A perfect symmetry. Symmetry! It's thanks to the job I had before. - What? - A barber. From the razor to the sickle. I was really good! - Can I ask you a favor? - I should cut your hair? Don't be shy! I'm good. I must buy something without Mom knowing. I need a loan. I need 30,000 Liras. I'll give it back to you soon. - You said 30,000 Liras? - Come on, please. Alright. Let's see. I should have it. I was mugged! Now I remember! I lost it playing Scopa and poker with that cheat Hamlet. What is this horror? A female with a beard! Silence. A female with a beard! Listen to this idiot! You're the idiot of all idiots. I have your medical certificate, so I can show it. - You know why he has long hair? - Because he's a female. Stupid! He's a gentleman of that age. Gentlemen had long hair. I am a gentleman, then! You are a gentleman? You are a poor devil. I curse the day I promised my mom to keep you with me. I still think it's disgusting with the beard! What are you saying? Mademoiselle's whistle. They should kill you! Mademoiselle. No, mademoiselle. This time I won't budge. - I don't understand. - I know. I'm not stupid. He won't give you money because he wants to hide it. Yes, no money. This time you won't find it like you did before. Not under the brick, in a chair, inside the mattress, because this time I hid it very well... So you could find it! It's 30.000. I'll give it back soon. Mademoiselle, my savings... Don't worry. You'll have it back with interest. All my money... All your money! All your money! - You're saying I'm a thief? - Weren't you even in jail? You stole military blankets. You did three months! It was a judiciary mistake. You were sentenced to 10 months and only served 3. I'll take you to the boss and have you fired! Just like that. Without waiting one minute more! - I'm not coming! - You'll come and don't run away! - Your brother's orders! - I won't come. A blunt object! A blunt object! You burned yourself! Stop! Stop! Look around! In Italian, Castello Sforzesco. How do you say "sorella" in English? Mario, hide back there. Try for the one with green eyes. I'll try for the giant. All Italians sing. You sing too? - You're little. - Are you teasing me? I was walking at night. I don't sleep anymore. - It's not night. It's day. - What do you care? When I met a girl who was alone, like me. I'm not alone. I'm with my group. I hope you are loaded! Go. You're alone! The face of a little boy... - I don't understand. - You'll realize it. She had everything. You know why? She had such green loving eyes! She had tears... You're not singing. You're a little cheater. I'm allergic to flowers! I'm allergic. You see? Give me a handkerchief. You are very sick. I'll cure you. What? I'm healthy! We went around the streets like lost swallows. We lived one thousand years in just two hours. When morning woke us, without talking I kissed her. She had such green loving eyes. And I kissed her because I love her. She had such green loving eyes. - Your friend sings very well. - I taught him. She loves me. Bravo. You're the pride of my old age. Sing. Believe, believe. She had such green loving eyes. The song was kindly offered by Milan by Day. A souvenir for me? A gift! What gift? Viking, give me back the souvenir! Look at her! - Darn it! - It wasn't the way to make money. He who thinks can make mistakes. I think too much. It's disgusting! - Think less and do more. - It isn't easy! Professor? Your friend Enrico said you were here. - I had the projector repaired. - You shouldn't have. I checked the film. The more ruined part is the jaguar one. - We can do it over again. - Even the jaguar? A friend of Mom's always brings back some wild beast from her safaris. - She can lend it to us. - And the jungle? - Here's our jungle! - It looks just like Mato Grosso. - We need water. - The jungle is jungle. - What is this noise? - Sounds like a typewriter. See how he looks at me? I'm not hungry anymore. - Let's go. - Enrico, get the animal. Why should I go? Send her! It's not a cat. His name is Attila. Attila, scourge of God. Where he passes, grass no longer grows. - He's a cub. - It could be a precocious jaguar. - Get him. I'll prepare the camera. - Yeah, sure! Hey, handsome... Hey! Want to smoke? Put it in this direction and zoom in on the jaguar's face. Good boy. He's heavy! Good boy, Where do I put him? - Don't scream! - You made him run away! Women, stay home! Attila, come back! - And now? - You look there. We'll look here. If we don't find him, Ivonne's maid will get in trouble! - Who cares! Shall we split up? - Yes, go on. You go ahead. Attila! Madam, did you see... He went this way. You're up there because you saw a jaguar come by? - No. I'm going to play football. - The jaguar is fierce. I starred in many movies with tigers and lions. I'm Gordon Mitchell. If I see the jaguar, I'll kill him! You've been warned. My stars are beautiful! Lollobrigida is beautiful. Rosanna Schiaffino is beautiful too. My kittens are all beautiful. Cats are all beautiful. He is beautiful too... That isn't a cat. My God, I'm scared! Must be from Vicenza where they eat cats. Giovanni... Giovanni, do you see what I see? - What is it? - A jaguar waiting for the bus. - I don't see any jaguar. - Don't look at it or it'll get mad. I don't see any cat. Must be one of your visions. - Take a good look. - It's not there anymore. They are full of dust. From morning till night I'm always here. Always dusting. I don't understand. My gosh! The jaguar rose from the dead! Teaching staff, I've asked you to come because we're in an ugly situation. You have been too lenient, especially with 2 B. What must your motto be from now on? Iron fist in an iron glove! You must be strict and pull out your claws. You must roar! - Did I scare you? - Did you see the ja... - Did you see the ja... - What? What's its name? - It's a cat. - It's a jaguar. It's a jaguar...alive. We won't find Attila. I hope nothing happened. Maybe Enrico found it. I'm afraid it can bite someone. It would be my fault. You won't be involved. I'll take the responsibility. - I won't let you go to jail alone. - You'd ruin your future. So you... You care a bit for me. Well... Yes. Me too, Mario. - Lisa, I... - Me too. Let's go. Attila is back! - Are you happy? - Yes and no. You're an industrialist's daughter. I should come to your villa and live off of you my whole life? - You've a Nuclear Physics degree. - But I've no money. - Money doesn't matter. - It matters a lot. - Mario, don't talk like that. - I must go. It's midnight. - Will I see you tomorrow? - I'll pick you up. Mario, I love you. It's midnight, little girl. Your father is waiting for you and you know it. A window that lights up is a signal, and you leave. You leave. Little girl, sleep until you want. Don't look at the ceiling. I'll go around the city. My heart is not sleepy. Sleep for me too. You can be sure that I'll go to bed early because I'd never cheat on you. The coffee milk tomorrow morning will be sweeter than ever. You'll think about me. The shadow of a kiss, then you rush up the stairs and leave. You leave. Little girl, sleep. Sleep as much as you want. Don't look at the ceiling. I'll go around the city, but my heart is not sleepy. Sleep for me too. I'll go to bed early because I'd never cheat on you. Sleep for me too. I looked for you all over Milan and you are here! Did you eat? I did. Did you? The 10,000 Liras I gave you? - Giovanna ate it. - Another woman? Of course! A four-legged one with a tail. A horse! What do I care? The same missile reactors were assembled on that plane. It's the fastest plane in the world. It came from Milan for us of the Space Center to see. Would you like to take a ride? How strange! He's my father. Excuse me. - Dad! - Sorry. Sorry... - Daddypooh! - Lisa, dear. How wonderful! Are you real or a vision? Sometimes... No, you're real. Sorry. I have the plane. I'll explain when I return. Wait. I'm coming! It's my flight. - You don't even give me a kiss? - Bye, my joy. I'll give you one for Mom too. Don't worry. It's nothing. Bye, my joy. I'm cold. It's humid in this area. Bye, Lisa. Write! - What happened? - Maybe he's hiding something. With his obsessions. I want to see Mom. Take me home. Maybe she knows what's happening. I hope it's nothing serious. I'll always be close to you. Thank you. You're a dear. Come. I'll accompany you. Gino is ruined and found refuge in Beirut. - Ruined? - Ruined with money, honey. Money, bank account, gold. Completely finished. I know nothing about business. He had to run away to Lebanon to give lawyers time to patch things up or he'd have gone to jail. - What can we do? - Honey, don't ask me. They'll confiscate the villa. I've a head-ache thinking of everyone who'll want to talk to me. Head-aches cause wrinkles. I don't want to be negative. There are lots of poor people. Aren't there more poor than rich? We'll become proletarians. Keep calm and wear a red bandana! You make things sound easy. Luca called. He knew everything. He asked for your hand. If you marry him, he'll fix things up. It was nice of him. Miss? Miss? I must go to the kitchen to get leftovers for the dogs. Are you hungry? You catch fish with stones? I must make a serious decision, but I don't want to. Don't do it, then. If you take it against your will, it'll be bad for you. - It's not easy. - Hamlet, you're so naive... - Idiot! - You'd sacrifice for who you love? - Of course! Miss? She's so nervous. What a lovely armchair. It's transparent! I will sit on it. There... Fire! Fire! There must be a fire! They're screaming "fire". Look at that idiot! He's in the water screaming "fire"! Imbecile! - Fire! - Imbecile! Idiot! - Superman, know what's new? - Yes. Daddypooh is in trouble. Why did he run away? There were more modern solutions. - I proposed them to him. - Did you talk to him? Yes. I proposed an extraordinary hit. An electronic hit at the bank would've fixed everything up. He didn't accept and preferred running away. - What'll you do now? - I'll sell my lab. With the money we'll face the first problems of poverty. Then I'll try getting hired in a factory and work. - At your age? - Now I'm the man of the house. I'll support you, and you behave. I'm more strict than my father! There will be no need. Bongiovanni, this is for you. It's from Miss Prandi. - Always extravagant! - What? Love, I'm sorry. I'm about to do something horrible. I must marry Luca. I still can't explain why yet, but if you'll be able to love me anyway, maybe one day I'll come back. Divorce is being studied. Don't hate me. I kiss you. Beautiful, as nothing else in the world were you for me. Just with a shadow of a smile, you broke the emptiness inside of me. The stars are already disappearing in the sky. Your smile has already disappeared in my heart. The new day that will come tomorrow will find you happy, but all the love inside of me will disappear with my tears. Tears that were born from a smile. From her smile that now flies up in the sky, is not for me. No. It won't be for me. If you should cry for me, repeat that you're not crying for love but for someone that was never loved. Pretend you have pity on the great love inside of me and my heart will die. Pretend you have pity on the great love inside of me and my heart will die. - You sing by yourself? - Leave me alone. Mr. Peppino, the Carabinieri are here for Mr. Prandi. Please come in. - Mr. Gino Prandi, please. - Please, come in. I walk badly because I have an ingrown toenail. Yes, ingrown. Mr. Prandi is waiting for you. Over there. - Mr. Gino Prandi? - It's me. - Why are you here? - You asked about me. - About you? About Mr. Prandi. - I'm Gino Prandi Junior. There's been a mistake. We're looking for your father, Gino Prandi Senior. If we arrest a little boy, we'll have to take him to nursery school. - The Carabinieri? - I got rid of them! Good job! Peppino, call Mr. Luca. Tonight at ten is fine. - Astronaut! Want to go on the moon? - On Mars, but away from Lisa. You'll go on Mars later. I found a club for you. You can say goodbye to Mars, the Moon, the Earth and Lisa. - I found you a job at the institute. - Is mine disgusting? You'll sing at "Nostromo". I'm the manager's friend. Come! A man is nothing in the world if he doesn't have a woman. If he doesn't have a woman. Lover never forgives. - How are you, Luca? - Not bad. - Please sit down. Thanks. May I, Lisa? - Moet Chandon 1959? - Perfect! I lost her because I made a mistake. I left her alone too often. I didn't think I loved her and I'll never see her eyes again. And now I'm a lonely man in the world. I don't have my woman anymore. The singing professor. What a career! Are you still interested in him? Nobody hears me now. My woman doesn't love me anymore! I breathe, but I don't know if I'm alive. Each voice seems like her voice. My life is like an empty sea. I'm a man who doesn't have her anymore. A man is nobody in the world if he doesn't have a woman. If he doesn't have a woman. Shall we dance? And I didn't know how to love her. I made a fool of her and now I'm a lonely man without her. And now I'm a lonely man in the world. I don't have my woman now. I don't have anyone around... Bravo, little professor. You sang very well. Here. Don't show up anymore. Behave, guys! You must sing and you respect who works. If I do this, I'll have you both kicked out. - Come, Lisa. - Pretty hair! - Let's occupy the villa! - Yes, yes! I'll sleep in the owners' room. The one with the canopy where Napoleon slept. I'm not more stupid than him! Everything we eat, peppers, watermelon, I planted, my dear sir! - Agostino is right! - Wait at least a month. Let's do something. Excuse me, please! Stay here at the 50%. I'll pay you. - How? You don't have money. - You shut up. - You'll go steal, thief? - No stealing! Let's show that at least the servants have a heart. A little boy is here! You want to convince us with emotions? When facing a little boy, when facing childhood, hats off to you! Cheers for Garibaldi! - So we'll stay? - Will you trust me? - We'll stay for the boy! - Thank you. I heard everything. I recorded it. I'll have Dad hear it when he gets back from Beirut. Good. You deserve a prize. I have the keys of the basement. Everybody go to drink! Drink, drink, drink. Gulp it down, and you'll see what a nice party! The medicine of the world in ruins. Don’t worry. It's this one. When Galbusera drinks Barbera, he slaloms around the lamp posts. Anyone is good at avoiding them. But he knocks them down. Beatrice uses the washing machine that her husband bought for her and when she drinks she has a hangover. When she is full of drinks, she stops. Drink, drink, drink and gulp it down, and you'll see what a nice party! The medicine of the world in ruins. Don't worry. It's this one. Then there's Hamlet who wants to secretly drink and begins to perform. To be or not to be drunk? The atrocious doubt will remain. Antonia only drinks cologne. She's the sophisticated type. Her hiccups smells so good that it becomes a snobbish matter. And drink, drink, drink. Gulp it down, and you'll see what a nice party! The medicine of the world in ruin. Don't worry. It's this one. If Granddad drinks a good Grignolino, he hears bells ringing. So dream of serene hangovers that will take place after life. And drink, drink, drink gulp it down, and you'll see what a nice party! The medicine of the world in ruins and they will drink in after life. Scopa! Scopa with 4! Here. The watch... See? See? All my savings. Patience! Patience! Maybe this really brings bad luck, with those crooked eyes. You know what? I'll take this to the pawn shop too. Bring them bad luck! - You can take these things. - Thanks, Miss Lisa. It's you, Luca. I see. They threaten a strike. Alright. I'm going to the factory. The workers want to occupy the factory. Good morning! I got scared! How ugly! Are you the man of the hole? Go away, idiot! I'm idiot. But I realized you're going to the pawn shop. And when Miss Lisa drops water from her eyes, I'm sorry... Here. Take this there too. You made a big effort! Death to the bosses! Just the day I was to introduce my girlfriend. This working class has no sensitivity for certain things. Don't worry. I've sedated worse revolts. Let's hear what they want. - You go. - No. You are our representative. - You must talk on our behalf. - I don't feel up to it. Please, do it for me. - Go, Riccardo. - I'll do it for you, Carola. They want to negotiate. I'll go, l'll unionize, and come back. Miss! Miss Lisa! - What is it? - We're safe! Safe! - It's a Michelangelo! - What? The old woman with the beard is worth two billion! Cheers for Michelangelo! I locked it up in my room! How wonderful! Cheers for Michelangelo! Cheers for Garibaldi! Cheers for the Risorgimento! - What are you saying? - Miss, that daub. The old woman with the beard, with crooked eyes. That disgusting painting that your mother thought brought bad luck is a Michelangelo! It's the "Gentleman of Verona" that was thought to be lost. It's worth one billion and a half. Two billion. Three billion! - What is it? - We are rich again! - I won't sell, then! - No. You won't. Peppino, I adore you! I don't have to marry Luca. I can't wait to tell him. I'll go now! You tell Mom. - Let's occupy the factory! - Calm down! Don't run! Don't push! Calm down. Don't hurt her! Make way. It's Lisa. Defend your rights from exploiting bosses! - Lisa, what are you saying? - Don't give up. Don't be scared! Defend your rights. Don't be deceived by my Mercedes. - I'm one of you. He has the yacht. - If you do this, it's no good. I won't marry a Carl Marx in a mini skirt. Ok? We won't get married tomorrow or ever again. I won't marry you! - I won't marry him! - Good! Here's the ring. Just friends. Or better, just enemies. - Giovanni, help me down. - Good girl! I won't go in the Mercedes anymore. What a girl! What a temperament! What... Carola! Hey. Yes, stop! Yes. Stop! Take me to the outskirts, I need to go to the Center. To go downtown catch bus number 47. No. At the Gorgonzola Space Center. There's no more gas in your car and you want me to take you? - I have a car, but I hate it! - You don't know our situation! - Do you have a heart? - I'm not a butcher! - I must go to the Space Center. - Easy. You'll break everything! Nice friend! I didn't want to do my military service and you found me a job as a cop. You're complaining? It's your first serious job. Did you see your love? She's marrying "pretty hair" Sunday. 2,500 guests, gold party favors. Not even wedding candies for you! Agent De Simone, go back to your place. Go back to your place! I understood! Stop! - I must go inside. - You can't. - What kind of officers are you? - Enrico! - You are Enrico? - Who are you? The lady blocked me at Gorgonzola... - Why Gorgonzola? - If your heart is on the outskirts... When I arrived... Was I clear? - No. Start over. - I must see Mario. - You're marrying Luca. - I won't marry him anymore. - You won't? Come here! - Where should I go? Can you read? You must disguise yourself or you can't go around. Walk as a man or they'll catch us. Come, sir! This way. Lisa with blue eyes, without your braids you're not the same anymore. It rains, there is silence between us. I'd like to talk to you, but you just leave. Yet until yesterday you called me love. - There's a interference. - Radio Montecarlo is everywhere. Isn't he the one who sang in the helicopter? It's a fixation! Our love began there. Lisa with blue eyes, without your braids you're not yourself anymore. Spring is over, but maybe life begins like this. Love made of wind. You were my first regret. Lisa with blue eyes. I search inside your eyes for the tenderness you no longer have. Yet until yesterday you called me love. But I am no longer in your thoughts. Class 2 B. Who would've imagined it would end like this. It rains, there's silence between us. I'd like to talk to you, but you leave. Spring is over, but maybe life begins like this. Love made of wind, you were my first regret. Spring is over, but maybe life begins like this. Love made of wind, you were my first regret. Bongiovanni, it's our turn. - He's not here either! - It's a labyrinth. It's lit here. Control room. Drills are starting. It's about to begin. I repeat. Control room, we are ready. I'm waiting for the ok to begin simulator drills. Over there! The helmet. Hurry! Thank goodness! I'd like to verify... With my own eyes, the efficiency... Your astronauts! Is it possible? This way. What is going on? I don't know.
