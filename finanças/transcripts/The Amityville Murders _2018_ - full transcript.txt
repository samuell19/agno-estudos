Subtitles by explosiveskull Testing. Okay, so here we are. My name's Dawn, Dawn DeFeo, and this is where I live. It's finally here, my big day. Eighteen and ready to conquer the world. Back here, my family's throwing a party. As if Italians need another excuse to celebrate. Say hello to my new camera, Allison. Hello to my new camera, Allison. Smartass. Just my luck, right? Born on the same day as my big, dumb brother. Bring it back! Shaggy took my Weeble. Fanabla, Jody! You ruined my shot! I'm telling! Hey, cut it out, you pigs! Marc, don't make me break your other arm. You rotten little shits! Stop it! Mom! And this is my mommy, who makes the best cakes and the best cannoli in the whole entire world. I spent all day long making this cake. What're doing? Ronnie! What are you doing? You're turning my $1.19 a pound ground round into charred ash! Where's Butch? Better not be smoking that shit again. - Get out here! - All right, I'm here. Quit busting my chops. Get out of my face. Now look what I've gone and done. Ma, I'm not six years old anymore, all right. Cut it out. Hey, watch your mouth. Don't get smark with your mother. Been looking for you for 20 minutes. Where you been? I was with Donna Benedettio, helping her fix the antennae on her television. I bet that wasn't all you were doing. Donna Benedettio. I don't want you hanging out with that puttana. She's from the gutter. What plays in the gutter stays in the gutter. Don't forget that. Right, we're from Brooklyn. Makes us practically royalty. I'm sorry, what'd you say? Ronnie, please, stop it, it's his day. His day, every day's his day. Hanging around my house like a bum. Huh, smoking pot with his hippy friends, not out in the real world making something of himself, fighting for his country like a real man, huh? Send him to that hell so he can come back in a bodybag? Besides, he's applied to Syracuse for next semester, didn't you, Butch? He's gonna get in, I know he will. Come on, who you kidding? He ain't got the brains for college. Whoo! Now everyone be nice. Okay. - Hello sweetheart. - Hi Papa. - Hi honey. - Thank you for coming. Oh, we wouldn't miss this blessed occasion, Louise. They grow up and they don't want to visit Grandpa... - Silenzio, Michael. - ...in the city. - Good to see you. - You too. - Sweetheart. - Hey, Pappa. Look. You're going off to college, I understand. Yeah. How you gonna get there? You're not gonna walk. There, buddy. Don't be jealous. - Doll, here. - No way. Pappa, no, it's all too much. Family is everything, you know that. I own the dealership, don't worry about it. Thank you, Nona. Guys, look! You're kidding me. Oh my gosh. These are some foxy wheels. This is groovy. Oh my god. - How do I look. - You look so good. Give me those keys. If he wants a car, he should earn it. Like I did. The last time I checked, you were on my payroll. Give those back to the kid. He's my grandson. I want him to have those keys. Now stop this shit. Go inside that fancy house of yours. Go get me a glass of vino, please. Maddon'. You call this marinara? That's how Ronnie likes it. Well, it tastes like your father's old socks. - Ma, don't! - What? Ronnie don't like his gravy so strong. Is that man putting his hands to you again? No, Ma, everything's good. In fact, we've been talking about the future. The future? Yeah. I didn't want to say anything until we made our decision, but... Ronnie got a job offer in California. It's good money, and chance for him to forge his own path. You know, and with Butch and then Dawn going to college next year, we really don't need all this room. Are you selling my house? I don't know, Ma, we... Like I said, we haven't made any decisions. Hey Nona. Hi sweetheart. Mmm. Love you, Mom. I don't want you kids down the cellar all day. We got company. You know, they say if you play this song backwards you can hear the voice of Satan. It's the sound your mother made when she gave birth to you. Ha ha ha, real funny. All right, name your first crush. Loretta Lynn. Shut the fuck up, Beak. I've got it. Angie fucking Dickinson, Police Woman. What I wouldn't do with those two magnificent melons. You're so gross. Butch DeFeo. Okay. Next one. A verb. Great, now I'm busy smoking it. She said verb, not herb, you putz. One more time, Pelskie, and I'll... And you'll what, huh, Beak? Hey, guys, mellow the fuck out, okay? I'll choose. Murder. Okay. Next one... Current state of mind. Insane. Okay. And last one... favorite room in the house. Any room where I can do this. You are disgusting, you know that? You're a pig, Pelskie. Oh, get off me. - Get her. - Mess up my hair. Well, mine would be the red room. What the hell is a red room? Well, read it, and I'll show you. Okay. Butch DeFeo is going to murder you after going insane in the red room. This used to be our secret hiding place. Come on, follow me. Whoa. Get off me. Hey, did you see that? Watch your fuckin' hands, you jerk! That wasn't me. That was a ghost. Come on in, gather around. Nope. Butch, aren't you coming? All right. Right here. Now that everyone's here, we can begin. Okay. Now, growing up on Long Island, we've all heard the stories about how this area was believed to be a portal of spirit energy, a place where the living could commune with the dead. This book belonged to our grandmother. In order for a summoning to take place, there must always be an offering. She taught us that if we focused our thoughts hard enough we could harness that energy and invite it in. Hmm. Your mother sucks cocks in hell. Shhh. Now that is seriously some heavy shit. What in God's name is going on down here? Daddy, we were just playing around, okay? Get your ass upstairs if you know what's good for you. Hmm? Goes for the rest of you. Get the hell out of my house, you goddamn losers. All of you, get out! Get out! Get out! Daddy, listen to me. Okay, it wasn't his fault. I'm the one that told them they could go in there. Haven't I told you I don't allow dopers and whores or mulignans in my house, didn't I tell you that? - Huh? - That's funny. 'Cause all I see is a sad, pathetic old pig. No! Butch! Are you okay? - What'd you call me? - Daddy, no! No, not that, please! No! No, you're not doing that, Daddy! Huh? Huh? Who do you think you are? Don't you ever... ever... ever talk to me that way again. That's enough! Daddy, please. Get upstairs, you little pansy. Change your clothes. Your mother wants to cut the goddamn cake. Butch, let me see. Are you okay? Oh my god. It's okay. It's looking better. Gotta get out of this house, Butch. Just gotta drive somewhere, far away, as far as we can go. I've tried. - Right? He always finds me. - Please. It's never gonna end, until that son of a bitch is gone for good. It's either gonna be us or him, you know that. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday Butch and Dawn ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday, Butch, my favorite brother in the whole wide world. Thanks buddy. Happy 23rd, son. My baby's all grown up. I'm so proud. Hey. See? My son. Okay. This song gets me so hot. It's the best. The best! What's wrong? Hmm? Can I get your attention? Take me inside and fuck me. You know I can't do that. Why not? Are you afraid big bad Ronnie'll catch you in the act? Give you another beating? Hey, shut your trap! Hey, did you bring that acid tab for me? Really? We've been going together six months. - That's all I'm good for? - No. You're listening to WAGL 1340, the smooth sounds of Long Island. But you brought it? Oh shut up already. All right. Last train to nirvana, ready for departure. Donna? Donna, someone's inside. They've got a gun. Stop! Stop! Get off! Get off! Get...! Donna, get off! Donna... Dawn?! Needle dick, piece of shit! Son of a fucking bitch! Have you lost your goddamn mind?! Damn you, Ronnie, let me back in this goddamn car! I need my fucking shoe! Fuck you! Whoo. Who's there? Some people have a deep, abiding respect for the natural beauty that was once this country. And some people don't. People start pollution, people can stop it. Ow! What...? Oh my God. Mom? I'm home. And now, for a morsel of mind-melting madness. Trick or treat! Oh, look what the cat dragged in. Hey, leave some for the rest of the block. Why do I have to be Cinderella again? Woolworths don't have Howdy Doody in your size. Hold still. What's with these flimsy five and dime costumes these days? In my day, Halloween was a serious business. In the old country we called it La Notte delle Streghe. The Night of the Witches. Witches? Real witches? Ma, enough. I don't want you scaring the kids. Yes, Bella, witches, real witches. See, in ancient times, it was the night the dead returned to their homes, when dark spirits ran amok across the countryside, and when offerings were made for the coming of the winter solstice. Offerings like giving candy? No. I'm talking about real offerings. Sacrifices. Ma, give it a rest. Bang bang! - Oh no! - You're dead! Jody, no shooting in this house. You can't kill the undead. Who are you supposed to be? ♪ She was a V-A-M-P vamp ♪ Why don't you get your big, fat vamp off my piano, huh? You let her go out dressed like this? Daddy, get with the times. I'll get with the times when you go upstairs and put on a coat. - No, but Dad... - But nothing. You listen to your father. Butch, what are you doing out of bed? I thought I heard something in my room. Come here, you. Shoot up all of Dodge City. Who are you, Wyatt Earp? Bang bang bang! What... What did you hear, son? It sounded like voices. Voices? Butch, we've all been downstairs. No, not your voices. Voices coming from my wall. All right, let's get this show on the road. I don't wanna be out all night, all right? All right. Will you drop me off at the train station? - Bring me my pocketbook. - Oh, my gloves. Yes, we'll take you to the train station, Ma. Let's go. Now Butch, I want you to go upstairs and get in bed, subito. And if you get hungry, there's minestrone in the ice box. Ronnie! If I see you, you're dead. Come on, where are ya? Show your face, I kill ya. It'll be okay, Jody. It's gonna be okay. Broke into the wrong house, guys. Why would they do this? They didn't even steal anything. I don't know. It'll be okay. Where are ya?! You're a dead man! Stay. Ronnie! Son of a bitch! Goddamn it. Where is he? No! No! No, Ronnie! Please! Get off me. Where the fuck is he? Fucker. Where is it? Where is it? I'm asking where it is! Tell me, you son of a bitch. - Don't! Stop it! - Where is it? Did you steal from me?! Did you fucking steal from me?! Did you fucking steal from me?! Did you fucking steal from me?! Stop, Daddy! If you fucking did I'll kill you. You son a bitch! Let go of him! Let go of him! Let go... That would be the cops. I called them. Don't do it. Don't do it, Daddy. No broken windows, no signs of forced entry, and you're not away of anything that was stolen? Well, my husband's personal safe... Nothing was taken, officer. - I put the kids down. - Where's Butch? Who's Butch, ma'am? Oh, he's my eldest son. He's the only one who's been home tonight. And is Butch in the house now? Well yes, but he's been quite ill. Doctors say he's got the bug that's been going around. I'd still like to speak with him, if it's all the same. You know, it's Halloween. It's probably some neighborhood bums playing pranks. But they didn't take nothing so let's just call it a night. - What do you say? - Your son, Mr. DeFeo? Yeah. - Are you Butch DeFeo? - Yes sir. Mind telling us what happened while your family was out? I don't know. I was asleep upstairs, like my mother said. I didn't hear nothing. Butch, sweetheart, you don't look so good. Go upstairs. Hold on, hold on. You expect us to believe that someone ransacked this house, except for the one you were in, and you didn't hear a thing? If my boy says he didn't see nothing or hear nothing, he didn't hear nothing, that's all. All right, Mr. DeFeo, thank you for your time. If you or your wife think of anything else, or you find out that something was stolen, please, give us a call. Oh, thank you very much, appreciate it, guys. Incidently, sir, shouldn't have your firearm out like that. Yeah, you're right. Have a good night, guys. Keep your family safe. Let's get out of here. Did you do it, Butch? Did you take the money from the safe? You'd be the first to know if I did. You've been acting weird ever since... Since the moment you decided we should play the game with them again. Remember when we used to talk to them? And they would keep us safe whenever Daddy was drinking or in one of his moods? Well, something different happened there the other day. Okay, I don't know what it was or how to explain it, but... it was almost like we made them angry. How? What did they used to tell us? How we would always live here. We've been talking about moving out. Mom and Dad have been talking about moving out. Come on, Butch. We were kids, playing a game. It was all in our imagination. Well... if we did wake them up... then maybe there's a way we can put them back to sleep. - Talk to me. - Where is it?! What? - Where is it?! - I don't understand! Where is it? Where is it? What's happening? - Where is it? Fucking money! - What?! What?! I'm gonna die, Louise. - Ronnie! - I'm gonna die! And here's the star of Name That Song, Jack Atwater. Quick, shut the door What's going on? There's someone parked across the street. Butch, they've been watching the house. Yeah, they're still there. Butch, go look. They're right there. Butch, don't let 'em see you. I wonder if it's the people who broke into the house. Do you think they're casing the neighborhood? Should I call the cops again? Looks like they're gone now. Butch, I don't know. I have a strange feeling that something really bad's about to happen. Butch, why ain't you talking to me? You okay? Stop playing around, okay? You're really scaring me. Butch, stop, what are you doing? Yes. Yes. Don't blame her. It's not her fault. Yes. Let go. Yes. I can't do that. Not now. I promise. What are you doing in here? Butch? Daddy, what is going on? - Stay right here, don't move. - No. Knock it off, Shaggy! It's just me. Shh. Good boy. Daddy! Son of a bitch. Come to my house in the middle of the night! Show your face, you coward! Come on, I'm waiting! Come on! It's okay. Yes. For the last time, I wanna know what's going on. I know. There's nothing going on. go back to bed. But I can't. I'm scared. I saw a man in a car outside my window. I don't want to. Would you listen to her? Your family's lives are in danger. You can't make me... You're insane? This goddamn family's gone insane! ...kill them. I can't talk about it right now, Ma, I've got too much going on. Yes, I'm gonna make the lasagne. I'm making your favorite recipe. I'm gonna kill both of you if you don't knock it off. I've got finals to study for. These kids are driving me up the wall. No, Ma, not this weekend. I've got too much going on. Tell Dad thank you for the card. Of course we're coming for Thanksgiving. Oh shoot! I don't remember, is it two cups of polenta or three? I've gotta go, Ma. Ronnie's almost home. Talk to you later. Love you, bye. That's not fair. I want some. Marc, what did I tell you? No fluffernutter before supper. Goddamnit, Ma, these are the best things going! You watch that filthy mouth or I will wash it out with soap! Oh, Ma. Allison, do not even think about drinking out of that bottle. Oh, damn it, Allison! Sorry. It was an accident. - Clean it up. - I'm cleaning it. - Hey, Mrs. D. - Is Butch around? - Hi boys. He's up in his room. - Scram. He's still feeling under the weather. What's wrong with him? Haven't seen his ugly mug for weeks. - I wish I knew. - Give me that! - It's almost time to eat. - Is there pasta? - Do you mind? - I don't mind at all. - Doesn't your mother feed you? - Sure. There's no comparison between her rump roast and yours. Stop. Cut it out. Stop. Come on, guys. Last one upstairs is a rotten egg. Stop. It's my dad. Well, I guess I'm late to the party, huh? Ronnie, they were just horsing around. Yeah, I can see that. Having a big party? Butch should be down soon, if you wanna stay for supper. Yeah, sure. Why not? Therefore... I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. It's been three months, they're still playing this bullshit. Leave it to the bleeding heart liberal media to stick it to the last great leader. What do you say, fellas? Can I offer you a cold one? Uh... Sure, Mr. DeFeo. There you go. Yeah. Daddy, I'm just trying to study here. Ahh. You know, back in my day, when we paid our neighbors a visit we showed our elders the proper respect. We didn't put our lazy unshowered, good-for-nothing keisters on their fine furniture. We didn't sit inappropriately next to their teenage daughters. Daddy, please stop. And we especially didn't make lewd sexual remarks in front of our own mothers. Hey, Mom, I'll help you. Back in my day... - we showed 'em who was boss. - Daddy... - In my day, that's what we did! - Daddy! We showed 'em who was boss! We showed 'em who was boss! - We showed 'em who was boss! - No! You see that?! Is that what you want?! You fuckin' mutt! Leave her alone! Let's show the boys a little party. Is that what you want? You little whore! Is that what you are?! You want these fucking mutts all over you?! Is that what you like? You want these animals all over you?! You want these fucking mutts all over you?! You want these fucking animals' hands all over you?! I'll fucking kill you! I hope that I will have hastened the start of that process of healing which is so desperately needed. I regred deeply any injuries that may have been done in the course of the events that led to this decision. ...rediscover those shared ideas... Let me see, Mom. This has been going on for years. It has to stop now before it's too late. Did I ever tell you I used to have the most vivid dreams when I was a girl growing up in this house. I dreamed of having my own family, the children I would bring into this world. Your grandmother told me they were premonitions. And she was right. But lately... my dreams have been different. I see the end coming. A terrible... beautiful... end. I see rain... and blood. And when it's all over... ...I feel... at peace. Because... we're all together when it happens... in our safe place. In our home. High Hopes. Yeah, it don't take much to point a gun at somebody. But it does take some serious balls to pull that trigger. You made me proud today, son. But remember this, next time it might be you looking down the barrel of that rifle. What the hell? I'm fed up, Ronnie! I don't wanna hear it no more! Louise, I've had that rifle 20 years. Never once did it misfire, not once, okay? I checked the chamber. There were two rounds in there. Should've blown my fucking head off but it didn't. I know why now. I was spared, Louise. That's just great, Ronnie! Now it's a sign from God of your redemption? You think locking us up in these bars and putting statues all over the house of the virgin Mary is gonna make up for all your sins? You said yourself there's something wrong with this house. You've always said that. Maybe you're right. You really don't get it, do you? It's not about the goddamn house. It's about you. No. Open your eyes. Butch is in trouble, serious trouble. What are you gonna do about it? I've told you a hundred times, Louise, I've got the goddamn devil on my back with that fucking kid! Butch is not the devil. He's our son. And he needs us, now more than ever. Six months in basic training with the corp, that's what that kid needs, they'll make a man out of him. He's hooked on drugs. He needs professional help, not a goddamn drill sargeant. No son of mine is going to some methadone clinic. I'll commit him to Bellevue before a place like that. I am done with this conversation. Louise, I'm talking to you. What are you doing? Where are you going? I am going to my mother and fathers' and bringing the kids. No you're not. I need time away from this house, and time away from you. You're not gonna leave me now. I'm under so much pressure. Okay, listen to me, I'm begging you. Just listen to me, Louise. If I don't come up with that money I don't know what I'll do. I'm sorry, okay? Just stay and talk to me. Be with me now, okay? Please, I'm begging you. I'm begging you, don't go over there. Don't go away now. Stay with me. Just... stay with me now. Jesus. Come with me. Butch? Look at this. Holy shit. Found it this morning. How much is there? $50 thousand, maybe more. Butch, you said you didn't take it. I... I didn't. I mean, my mind is all twisted up. I can't eat, I can't sleep. I just spend night after night after night... watching. Watching what? Watching you. Did you know that the natives on this part of Long Island have a ritual for burying their dead? Every winter... they would banish all the most savage criminals, all the outcasts, all the enemies of the tribe. They would tie them to trees, leaving them to die slowly from the exposure, starvation... disease... madness. And then, when they were dead... they would bury them, face down. Butch, look, I don't know what's going on with you, but you have to get out of here. Did you know that everyone in this house sleeps face down? Every single night. No one stirs. Not even a sound. It's as if everyone goes to the same place... shares the same dream... All tucked warmly in their beds. So quiet... a calm... so at peace. Butch... Butch, look. Butch, we have to get out of here. Come on, let's go. What the fuck?! What have we done? We awakened them. Hey, Butch, I overheard Daddy earlier. He was saying he wants to have you locked up, committed. All right, we have to get you someplace where he... I'll be okay. But I think you should go. - What? - Tonight. Okay, what are you talking about? I'm not going anywhere without you. What do you think is gonna happen to the kids if I'm gone? Don't you think he's gonna go after them next? There is no way out. No. Not for any of us. Except you. He's dangerous. Go away! Go away! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Go away! What if he refuses to go? - He's not gonna cooperate. - He's lost his mind. We'll have to restrain him. I'm telling you, it's either us or him. I already mixed in a sedative. I'm getting him out of this house. What if he refuses to go? I've got the devil on my back. We might have to restrain him. Does everybody know what to do? Do not let him know what we're planning. I think I hear him coming. We were getting worried about you, son. You've been sleeping all day. Huh? You must be hungry, son. Come on, join us for some supper, what do you say? Got my cast off today. Looks like I can beat you up, again. Says someone who fell down the stairs. You pushed me. - I did not. - Yes you did. Go ahead, take your coat off, son, have some dinner, come on. Butch, come sit down, baby. I made you your favorite dish. Hey Butch, any idea where your sister might have gone? - No sir. - I'm sure she'll be back soon. Why don't we just enjoy our last meal together? Jody, would you like to lead the family in grace? Thank you for our home so sweet; Thank you for the food we eat; Thank you for the birds that sing; Thank you God for everything. Amen. That was lovely. Shall we eat? Some storm we have tonight, huh? Want some? No. No! God...! It's just a storm. - Go away. - Butch. Go away! Butch, calm down. What's wrong with you? Leave us alone! Come on. Whoa. Put down the knife. You're gonna... Everybody stay back! Whoa whoa whoa. You're gonna hurt yourself. Crazy son of a... Leave me alone! Go away! Butch, don't be afraid. Where do you think you're going? Sorry to show up so late, Nona. Oh, the storm's getting closer. I had to get out of there, Nona. There's something really wrong with that house. You've always known that the house is... special. But what is it about the house? When I met your grandfather he had big ideas and big dreams and he worked hard. When your mother was born he took me out to Long Island. He was already working two jobs. But... he scrapped together enough money to buy a small parcel in Amityville. He felt a strong connection there, we both did. He bought the land from a wealthy man named Moynahan. My Michael spent the next year building our house, your house. It was everything he ever wanted for his family. And that's why we named it High Hopes. Over time, we attained a life of certain means. The house took care of us, and we took care of it, you see? But Nona, the house, whatever lives there, it makes things happen, bad things. Were you reading from the book? Nona, we were just playing. Just like you taught us when we were small. Conjoration isn't a game, bambolina. You know this. Now come on, tell Nona everything. I'm afraid, Nona. It feels like we're being... haunted. We're all haunted by something, by our past, by our mistakes... by our sins. Shhh. You'll be safe here with Nona tonight. Bogeyman? Where are you going, child? Home. I'm going home. It's not safe for you out there, not tonight, not with this storm outside. What have you done to us, Nona? They are angry. Dawn, please don't go back to that house! Mom? Dad? No! Oh my God! No! Allison! Allison! Oh my God. No. Oh my God! Butch. What are you...? What are you doing? Please. Butch, don't. You have to help me. Butch, what are you doing? Please, Butch, you have to. Please. Please stop! No! Butch, don't. Please, don't! You don't have to do it to me. Butch! No! Please, Butch, you don't have to do this! Stop! Butch, no! No! There's no way out, Dawn... - I see rain... - ...not for any of us. ...and blood. There's no way out. And when it's all over... There's no way out. ...I feel at peace. What did they used to tell us? How we would always live here. There's no way out, Dawn. We're all together when it happens... in our safe place. What did they used to tell us? That we would always live here. ...in our home. High Hopes. Now I lay me down to sleep; I pray the Lord my soul to keep; And if I die before I wake; I pray the Lord my soul to take Dawn? Dawn? Six members of a suburban New York family have been found shot to death in their beds. It appears that all of them were murdered while asleep. The victims have been identified as members of the DeFeo family. They were found by a 23 year old son Ronald DeFeo who is believed to be the only surviving member of the family. You're going to love this one. It's a real charmer, perfect for a new family. George and Kathy, come on in. Let me show you how the other half of Amityville lives. Subtitles by explosiveskull
