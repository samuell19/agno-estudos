My great-great-great... ...great-uncle was a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and my mother's side started building New York before the Revolution. You get the idea. I went to a party once, and there was a palm reader there, and... when she looked at my hand, she just... She froze. And I said to her, "I know." My life line is broken. "I know I won't live past 30." You know those photos of smiling families you always see on a mantelpiece? I can't even look at them because you never know what they're hiding. A Lifemagazine photographer came to our house to photograph the ideal American family. And we looked happy and pretty, but... underneath it just wasn't that way at all. Looks like the country is disintegrating, lost all its hope. There's always hope, no matter what's happened before. Yeah? Where's the hope in that? You know, when he first started painting, everybody thought he was mad. Can you imagine? God, wouldn't it be wonderful to know that students were looking at your work, analyzing it? That depends on what they're saying. I mean, people say he's a no-talent freak. - Well, I mean, he's changing the way that we look at the world, isn't he? I think people who manage to do that must have the hardest time in life. Are you sure you'll be okay in New York? I'll be fine, I've got Chuck to look after me. Oh, Syd, why won't you come too? 'Cause my folks would kill me. Where I come from, it's not easy to get a scholarship. You know, I'm not so sure about Chuck. He can be a real shit sometimes. Don't worry. Edie! Chuckie, how can you want to go home? We're in Manhattan. To become an artist, I had to get out of that classroom. And to me New York was Jackson Pollock sipping vodka and dripping paint over a raw canvas. There's so much to see, Chuck. Look where we are. Yeah, we're taking New York by storm. Two zombies. Chuck and I had come down together from Cambridge. You know, he was a flamboyant socialite who carried a pocketful of calling cards. He made me feel I wasn't alone. Can we play the game? I don't want to. - Come on. - All right, go. - Lamb. - Chop. - Pony. - Snout. - Shy. - You. You think I'm shy? Sometimes. - Guess I can be shy sometimes. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. What are your sins, my son? Well, I have this friend Mark. And, well, he buys all these clothes from Bloomingdale's. But because he's from London, everybody on the Cape keeps talking about his "fabulous English look," which really is so good. He was at a party up there last weekend, and Norman Mailer walked up and punched him in the stomach. And when Mark asked him why, he just said it was "for wearing a pink coat." I know I should've been happy for Mark that Norman Mailer punched him, but all I could think was, "Will Norman Mailer ever punch me?" I didn't even have a pink coat. Or get invited to those glamorous kinds of parties. Andy, why do you come to confession? Well, because it's a sin not to. Edie, come on now. It's going to be over by the time you're done. You're not even going to meet him. We're going to be late, very late. Well, I just don't understand. Why are Jasper's selling and mine are not? And who would it be so people know about art? Well, we know how to buy it. I wonder if Picasso knows who I am yet. Who cares about these people? They're so '50s, so boring. Not very chic. Very English. I love the English, don't you? Mick Jagger is so sexy. I always hear he has a really big cock. What? Andy, what are you doing here all by yourself? Well, I'm not by myself, Syd, I'm here with Lex and Molly. Of course you are, sorry ladies. May I steal him away? How's the movie business? Oh, well, it's busy, but I wouldn't call it a business. I mean, I haven't made any money off of it yet. Of course you haven't, Andy. The movie business is the most fickle in the world. - You know that. - I know. Listen, I have met the most remarkable lady. - Oh. - Old money, very old. Oh good, does she want to buy a painting? Who is she? Oh, thank you. Oh! That's her. That's Edie Sedgwick. - Oh. - What good manners. Chuckie, pay attention to these gentlemen. You just might learn something. Oh. She's so beautiful. It's like a morgue in here, please. Her father struck oil out West. She escaped to art school in Cambridge or somewhere. Made her way down here last year. She's done some modeling. Tried to get into a gallery, but no one has ever seen anything she's done. When you said old money, you made her sound 50. Is that the Andy Warhol? Want to meet him? Of course. Edie, this is Andy. -Hi. Oh, it's just amazing to meet you. I think you're just a genius. Oh. No one is doing anything like you right now, and that in itself is a sign of brilliance, don't you think? I'll leave you two alone. Oh, there's four olives. Oh, is that really bad? Well, not if you eat them because I just couldn't bear the thought. Oh, well I don't really like olives, but I'd love you to be in one of my movies. I would love for you to eat my olives. Oh. And what would I have to do in one of your movies? Just be yourself. Well, which one? Well, you talk to Chuckie 'cause he handles all the little details. You're the boss, applesauce. What'd I tell you? Is she a star or what? Oh, I would sure love to work with her, I've never seen a girl with some many problems. Andy, in your films, what are you hoping to do? We're just trying to make it so bad, but doing it well. You know, where you get the most scratches you can on a film. Or all the dirt you can get on a film. Or... Zooming badly, where you zoom and you miss the most important thing. And... Your camera jiggles so that everybody knows you're watching a film. How do you work with your actors, then? What do you tell them? Well, I don't like to tell them what to do. I mean, I just think people are so interesting. Some say your work is pornographic. Oh, yeah. Isn't that great? So... Do you work in hay? Oh yeah, we're making a cowboy movie. Who are all these people? Oh. Well, that's Rotten Rita, and Silver George, Debbie Dropout. The Turtle. I don't know who that is. Who's that? This is Ondine and Brigid. This is Chuck and Edie. Hello. Andy, I got a new book to draw in. It said on the front The Topical Bible. I didn't know what the theme should be, so I thought, "What rhymes with topical?" And then I started rhyming. Topical, bopical... And then I got to "C." Cockical. I mean, it's perfect, right? An entire book about cocks. Yeah, that's great. Her last book was called Scars, but Cockshas a nicer ring to it, don't you think? Like a cock ring. I wish my phone had a cock ring. Yeah. So, who's gonna be in your book, anyone famous? Maybe we can get the President's. Oh yeah, Johnson's Johnson. Brigid, you got to call your father. Are you insane, Andy? Do you know what my father would say to me? Maybe he'd want to be in the book. Yeah. Brigid's father has an empire. He's very rich. Oh, you should do your cock for the book too. Oh, this one is mine right here. Hey, Bridg. What if the cops come here? Where's the sign? Who took the sign down? Hey, Andy, we're ready. Oh, we're gonna do the movie. You want to see? I can give him a tranquilizer. Tranquilizer? I'll take one of those, Mary. Will you put the microphone in lower so we can see it? Yeah, neat. Have you used one before? - No. - It's easy. Why don't you turn it on? - Yeah? - Yeah. Andy Warhol's Horse. Which one of you has a gun? Which one of you has a gun? Look at the size of it. I want to ride it. You've seen bigger, yeah. Hello? Easy boy, easy. What do you think of The Factory? Do you like it here? - Of course. I think it's always good to get beyond your experiences, you know? And I hate it when people take themselves too seriously. Don't you? Oh, yeah. I read somewhere that you were born in California. Is that true? Yes, but we were from back east originally. Well, Fuzzy got sick. And so he wanted to move to a warmer climate, and he bought a ranch in Santa Barbara, California. And that's where I was born. Who's Fuzzy? Oh, Fuzzy's my father. Oh. My father. And is Chuck your best friend? He's my best girl friend. Who's your best boy friend? Oh, that's easy. That would... Actually, it's not that easy. I would have to say my brother Minty. Oh, well, you should bring him over. I can't. I wish I could. He's dead. Well, who is the first boy you made it with? The first boy I made it with was at Silver Hill. Oh, the hospital? Oh, I hear it's very chic. Didn't Cornelia Vanderbilt go there? All I had to do was walk in on Fuzzy fucking our neighbor. And then, when I told my mother, well, Fuzzy said that I was imagining it. There has to be a better way. But even after all the pills that he pumped me up with, I knew what I saw. And so he sent me off to Silver Hill just like he did with my brothers Minty and Bobby. It was sort of the Sedgwick way. Who was the first boy you ever kissed? Fuzzy. Silver Hill. I can't take it anymore. I want to die. Why do you want to die? Because my credit's no good at Bonwit Teller. Because I just stole $30 worth of underwear from Bergdorf's, and I think I might do it again. Is that you, Edie? I thought you might be lonely on the watch. Don't lie to Wanda. I've known you for too long. But really, Wanda, everything is just super. I met the most fantastic people. I went to this gallery. You know, Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol. And I may get a show there. And somebody asked me to be in a movie, Wand. Wouldn't you love to be in a movie? Are you still seeing a doctor? - In today's news, rioting continued in Alabama as civil rights demonstrators converged on the courthouse steps in downtown Selma. ...who could grant any wish. - Andy was a little boy who needed to be taken care of. I mean, his mother moved in with him when he was 22. As a child, he had this horrible nervous condition. It made him feel like an outsider. - Thanks, Mama. - I like your Sunday personality better. - Hello? - Hello? - Hello. Hello. How are you, dear? - Well, Andy, I'm just about ready to flip my lid. Henry Winthorpe III just left The Factory. - Oh, the toothpaste heir? - How were his teeth? - Oh, I didn't notice, but his cock was beautiful. - Was it big? - Listen. - Did he know you were taping him? - He insisted. Andy, I'm getting such good tapes. - Jeannie! - I don't care if she is wearing a wig. It's a movie about boys. It's supposed to be an all-male cast. - But Edie looks like a boy. Like a beautiful boy. - And I think she's fantastic, but she shouldn't be in this. It throws off the whole concept. It's supposed to be about thugs and JDs and hooligans. - Oh, I know. - I know. - Is she gonna say anything, or is she just gonna sit there like a mannequin? I just don't think she's cut out for this. - Well, Gerard, maybe Edie doesn't think that you're cut out for it either. - Vinyl, a film by Andy Warhol starring Gerard Malanga. - I'm a troublemaker. A hooligan. A real motherfucker. So if you got a problem, I can stick it where I can put it whether you want it or not. - Why is he doing that? Why doesn't he stop? - In The Factory you were accepted and encouraged and even expected to be different. Andy made me feel comfortable, and I believe that he felt comfortable with me. No, I'm serious. Let's say you're on a TV show like Steve Allen and he says, "So, Edie, any plans for getting married?" -Okay, fine. But I could only marry four, maybe three people. - Oh, who? - The future Earl of Litchfield, but he'll have to be the last, I think. - Oh. - And oh, Mick Jagger. - Oh, yeah. I hear he has a really big cock. - And then who? - Nureyev. But I don't think he likes women. - Are you allowed to say that on television? - Oh, Andy, we couldn't say anything on television. They'd have to tape our mouths shut. - It's so much more fun in New York since you showed up. - Those were really the happiest days of my life. When we were experiencing life on our own terms. And what better way to say goodbye to Edith Minturn Sedgwick, the Mayflower girl. - Andy, what do you think of Edie's new look? - Oh, it'll be great. - I can't wait to see it. - Andy took ordinary objects and made them iconic. And I always thought that he was throwing America back in its face. You know, turning the assembly line into a punchline. - Hello? - Andy. - When are you going to show me your drawings? You've showed them to Gerard and Brigid. - I want them to be the right ones. - Well, just put anything together. We'll make a show. Ileana Sonnabend is coming to New York next month, I'll introduce you. - Really? I will. - This weekend I'll... - Oh no, not this weekend. We're supposed to go to Fire Island, remember? - Well, when am I supposed to get it done? - It'll happen. - I wouldn't worry about it. - That's easy for you to say. You have nothing to worry about. - Oh, that's not true. The Sculls canceled a whole order of Brillo boxes. - Andy, I know plenty of people in New York who are looking to buy great art. - Edie, I just think it will clash terribly with the Biedermeier chairs. - Well, you can just say whatever color you want. - I just picked up a new blue from Pearl that's fantastic. - Well, Mrs. Shingle, just so you know, my mother had one done last month, and she was so happy with it she ordered three more. Your mother always did have excellent taste. Taupe I think would work best. - I wonder if people are gonna remember us. - What, when we're dead? - Yeah. - I think people will talk about how you changed the world. - I wonder what they'll say about you in your obituary. I like that word. - Nothing nice, I don't think. - Oh, no, come on. - Let's say... "Edith Minturn Sedgwick, beautiful artist and actress." - And all-around loon. - Remembered for setting the world on fire and... - Escaping the clutches of her terrifying family. - Made friends with everybody and anybody. - By creating chaos and uproar wherever she went. Divorced as many times as she married, she leaves only good wishes behind. That's nice, isn't it? - Well, I hope I die first because I'd be too sad if you died before me. Tell me other places you lived after that. - I lived in Paris when I studied art. - The French, they're just so good-looking. - Andy, we should go. You know, actually, when I say it it makes sense for you to be there right now. - But I didn't think they liked new art anymore. - You just take some of the flower paintings and the movies, and they'd appreciate you so much more than they do here. You know, here people don't really know why you do what you do. But in Paris, they don't care. So you're free to express it however you want. Or they only care that you know why. - Oh, well, I just do it because I'm ugly and there's nothing else for me to do. You're not ugly, Andy. - Well, I do have my good days. - Three shrimp cocktails, extra lemon, extra cocktail. And then I'll have the salmon grilled. - Is it fresh? - Oh yes, ma'am. - No butter, but extra parsley. Oh, and lots of Russian dressing. - $200? - And you? - Oh, I'll just have a peanut butter sandwich. - I'll see what I can do. - Oh, and put everybody on my tab. - Yes, ma'am. - I don't understand. These are all your bills? - I know, they're huge. You might have to start paying me. Either that or I'll have to move into a one-bedroom or a studio. Oh God, where would I keep all my clothes in a studio, Andy? - What should I do? - Oh, nothing. I just think what you're doing right now is so glamorous. - Really? - Yeah. - Darling, where did you get that blouse? It's simply divine. - It's Donald Brooks. - Here, try it on. We're about the same size. - There I was in the midst of Harry Carey when it hit me. 24 hours in the life of Edie. One day. One movie. - You are so much fun. How come you don't spend more time with us? - Because of my lips. - Your lips? - They have a hard time kissing Andy Warhol's ass. - Yeah, that's great. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Right? - How well do you and Edie speak French? - So, Andy wants to take us to Paris with him. - Oh, fabulous! - Let me settle the check. Waiter! Everybody, we're leaving. Brigid. Oh, darling, we're leaving now. Would you charge it to my account? - If you could wait here for just a minute. - A minute? - Why, that's a complete lifetime. I mean, there are things that are born, live, and die in a minute. Well, don't ask me what, dear, because I couldn't tell you, but I have to go to Paris. No, you just tell Mr. What's-His-Name to send me the bill. Oh, and how's my hair? - Stunning, madam. - Well, I don't know. I guess I'm bored with it. So I'm just going to quit painting and we're going to make movies now. Make Edie a big star. Well, I'm not going. I have nothing to wear. -Why don't you just try on some clothes? - I don't feel like trying on... Why do I have to try on clothe? - You have a whole closet full. - Do I look different? You know, I ran into an old friend who said every time I saw him I looked so different he hardly knew who I was. Well, do you think that's true? - Edie Sedgwick in Andy Warhol's Poor Little Rich Girl. - Bravo! - Oh, that's so nice. - I just love that he doesn't speak any English. Aru, I want to touch your cock. - Oui, Andy, oui. - Oui. Isn't he great? I can't tell what he's saying, but he just keeps talking about Edie. Just take your pants down. - Andy, critics may love you in France, but here they say your work is superficial and that you wouldn't be where you are without Edie. - Oh, well, I don't pay attention to what they write. I just measure it in inches. - Edie, I understand you're an artist too. - That was a very long time ago. - Edie's too beautiful to be an artist. I think artists should be ugly. No, Edie's a superstar. - Superstar. - That's crazy. - There's one more thing on the sidewalk. - Look at that. - Oh, that's what he said. - I got it. - It's like a madhouse in here. Oh, Andy, this is my mother Alice! She just flew into town to help me furnish. - Oh, hi. Oh, you're so beautiful. It's so nice to meet you. - No, no, no, no, no, no. - Careful with that box, love. - It's Waterford. Betsy Johnson. I know, isn't she fabulous? She asked me to be her first model. Anyway, I've got to go. Ciao. Oh, he made it, isn't he beautiful? His name is Waldo and I got him an Abercrombie flannel. Did you have a nice trip over? Oh, Mum-mum, aren't you proud? Pretty soon money will be falling off trees. I won't need any help at all. - There's a novel idea. - But, Mom, don't you think that Fuzzy would get a kick out of all of this? - Oh, please. - Your father's so square, he doesn't even pee in the shower. -Mum-mum! - Hello. - I think your daughter is gonna be super famous. - And what would be the value in that, Mr. Warhol? - Oh, well, I think everybody wants to be famous. - Well, I had much higher hopes for Edith. - Oh. - You know, I used to dance twice a day. I'd do this jazz ballet. And I'd wear leotards and black tights, and I was too lazy to take them off. And I decided to go with it. - Divine one, I am entirely superficial, and I intend to stay that way. But you, my dear, you are the real thing. America's next "It" girl. We'll put you under contract. - People started to notice, and it sort of caught on. You know, the earrings, the thick black eyelashes. It was all a part of the show. - This is Andrea Romando with the BBC. I'm here with Edie Sedgwick at the infamous Factory. She is known as Andy Warhol's superstar. And in New York, she has been dubbed the Queen of Underground Cinema. Edie, how does your family feel about you having this title? - They hate it. - They hated the idea of my doing any modeling to make my own way. And as soon as I started all of this, they're sending telegrams saying, "Oh, you've got to go model, please." - At an Andy Warhol art exhibition... - The glamorous Miss Edie Sedgwick unraveled her long white... The Plymouth Rock princess and her commoner companion Andy... In town last night at Max's Kansas City... Hollywood legends... - The first girl to bring sex appeal to American high society. - I'll have a porterhouse. - She'll do the sirloin. - Actually, I think I'll try the chicken tonight. Coq vin, please. - Miss Sedgwick? - Why don't you have the grilled fish? No butter. We don't want you blowing up now, do we, honey? You game for a steak, Warhol? You sure look like you could use one. - The Met is thinking of buying some of Andy's work. - Oh, lovely. - How about this? I've just been commissioned for a 30-foot bronze stallion in downtown Santa Barbara. - Oh, Edie does horses too. - Well, where do you think she learned that? Has Edie told you about my studio? - Yeah. - I've seen some of your work, Warhol. You're really more of a printmaker than an artist. What's your family do? - Well, my father was in a coal mine. - Andy and I are thinking about making some more movies together. - If you can call them that. - You can call them whatever you want. Like Dorothy, or... - Ondine. - Hillary. - You know, this whole time I'm thinking, "Who is this guy who has my little girl all turned around? He must be some kind of man." Then I talk to you for two minutes, and I have to smile because I don't have a thing to worry about, do I? You're a full-blown queer. - Andy, we can go now. - Edith. Don't you dare make a scene. - Minty had been... I guess an embarrassment to the family because he was different. He was... He was a homosexual. And Fuzzy knew it. And when Minty came clean, Fuzzy called him a faggot. You know, he just, he broke him. And when they closed the casket lid on my brother Minty... I remember Fuzzy just standing there. No reaction, just... standing there. like a stone. And for days, the whole family just sat around the ranch as though nothing had happened. And at his funeral, no one cried. No one. Not even my brother Jonathan, and I ran at him, and I pounded my fists on his chest. And he didn't cry. I... I had to cry for all of them. - Oh, you made it. - That's great. Oh, hi. Look who's here, everybody. Hi. - Hey, Mick, how are you? Oh, it's great to have you here. I love the album. - Jesus, Richie. - The tissue's hardened, Brig. You got to really push. - Hey, Brig. What are you girls up to? - Cocktails, darling. - Adderall, Digoxin, and Dextromethamphetamine. - It's certainly more kick than a martini, no? You go to med school, Brig? - My parents have had me doped up on diet pills since I was ten. - Well, my parents plopped me in the bins before I could drive. - You're an Aquarius, aren't you? - No, I'm an Aries. - I know an Aquarius when I see one. I just adore Aquariuses. You thirsty for a poke? It's divine. - Edie, why don't you tell us a story? Tell us about Arthur Bainbridge. - Charles, I do not want to tell that story. It's so sad. - Oh, I've read about him. His mother's family made a fortune out of real estate. - That's him. Well, we went out a few times. You know, nothing chic, but all very fun. And one night we were all set for this date at Tavern on the Green, only Chuck and I got into this very deep and long conversation about the tarot and the "I Ching" and all this completely fascinating stuff, and Arthur shows up, and he's just so possessive. And I didn't want to hurt his feelings, I knew he'd be furious if he knew that Chuck was there, so I had him hide in the closet. And Arthur got down on one knee just like in the movies, and asked me to marry him. He bought this ring from Tiffany's. And, well, he kept going on about children and Connecticut, and can you imagine? - Could you? - No. No. But he was in tears. A boy who has everything in the world was just reduced to absolutely nothing. And then Chuck jumped out of my closet laughing hysterically, and Arthur was just mortified. - Oh, he was boring. - Yes, but he was sweet. I mean, Chuck, you really are completely ruthless. - Hey, Rich. Did you see my mother's face when she met Andy? I thought she was gonna burst. - I know, my mother's horrified. Brig keeps threatening to invite him to Christmas dinner if she doesn't up our allowances. - Well, no wonder you never run out of money. - Edie. - Syd! What are you doing here? - I've been sent to find you. - Oh, that sounds mysterious. Who sent you, the Red Chinese? - No, but... I am working for someone pretty big. - Rockefeller? - Bigger. - Bigger than Rockefeller and the Red Chinese? Well, pray tell, who? - Why don't you come with me and I'll show you. - Who's that? - Taxi! - Oh, darling, I landed straight down on my Margaret Jarrold pumps. Thank God I didn't break an ankle. You know, when I came to New York, I was a bit... - Second Avenue and Fifth, please. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Open the windows, dear. - Windows. But I realized that I wasn't an artist, but who was I, a model? That didn't seem to fit either, you know? - That'll be 85 cents, please. - Shit, I don't have any cash. You gotta be kidding me. - Well, I never carry any either. - What? - Well, here, take this. - What's that? - That is a beautiful ring just for you. Are you coming? - You're still sculpting, I hope. - That was just my great escape. - Do you remember that time when we went to that restaurant, oh, what was it called? Durgin Park in Faneuil Hall. And all the waiters were so crusty, and, oh! - Watch it. - Watch it! Jesus. - And then I was dancing on the tables, do you remember? And I think that they thought that I stole something, when really I only meant to borrow it. Oh no, it wasn't you! - I don't know what you're talking about. - It was Don-Don. - And Chuckie was there. - Edie. Edie, Edie, Edie. - I nearly died laughing. - Edie, I have somebody that I want you to meet. This is Edie Sedgwick. Edie, how about a picture? - Well, hello. Put your arm around her! - Hey, how about one shot? One shot, Miss Sedgwick? - I got to go to work, sweetheart. - Well, I wasn't interested in him because he was famous. It wasn't as if he was the first famous person I'd ever met. But he was so different. - We caught a couple of your films last week at the Cinematheque. - God, you did? And? - It was... They were good. No, no, no, they were good. We just, well, we didn't really understand what they meant. - I don't know if they're supposed to mean... It's just sort of like, you know, I'm watching a Henry Moore sculpture, but a little bit out of focus, you know? - Well, I don't know if it clears it up for us, but... - Sounds very, very pretentious. Can I get a little milk for my coffee? And what about you? Your songs are pretty profound. What are you trying to say? - I'm not trying to say anything. I don't know, I guess I write about what I see. That's really good. - It's a doodle, it's not... - No, no, no, no, that's a good drawing. So, you're an artist? - Oh, no, not really. Anymore. - What? You're not drawing anymore. Why? - I don't know, it's just hard to find the time to sit down and be alone. I just find it hard to sit still. - Seriously, you gotta find the time to do this. - The music was just hypnotic. - I just think he's so maximal. - Isn't he? - And he just has that power. You know people who have that power. - Like Superman? - You can't really explain why it is. It just is. Well, what do you say to someone like that? I mean, he's just so famous. - We didn't really talk, you know. - Oh, you didn't? - It was just nice to meet him. Andy, what do you think of this? Très chicor très fou? - Oh, très chic, definitely. - Well, I have to watch my spending. - Especially on clothes. - Oh. - You know, I already stopped wearing underwear. Shit, what other sacrifices do I have to make? - Who do you think you are? Your family is so rich. I mean, you're living on Easy Street. Oh! Oh, Mama would love this. - I can buy it for you. - Oh no, you need to watch your spending. So, tell me more things. Who else was he there with? - I don't really remember that, you know? But it was just something about those lyrics. What he was saying was really poignant. Like he really had something to say. - I was just saying that he really had something to say. - How much is this? - Seven. - $7.00? - $7.00. - Oh no, that's too much. Well, I could give you $4.00. - What do you think? - I think you look beautiful. - Oh, I don't know. - What's wrong? Is this about that Syd character? - Have you ever analyzed things to the degree where you can't really remember the difference between what's real and what you've created in your head? - I know that I'm real, and I know that you're real. And I know that that's real. - I don't know, I just wish that life could be more simple, you know? James, dear, what are you doing here so early? - I... - Sit down. - We had an appointment at my office at noon, Miss Sedgwick. It's30. You've known me since I was three, James. Call me Edie. - Your... spending, Miss Sedgwick. You're going to be bankrupt soon. - James, you take life too seriously. How could I possibly be bankrupt? My grandfather invented the elevator. - Then you should be familiar with the concept of up and down. When you got here, your trust f... Thank you. Your trust fund was up. After a year and a half, it's almost in the basement. - Oh, shit. - What, what, what? - Well, what about all the money that I'm making? - Well, you keep spending it. Your father is very upset with you cavorting with drug addicts and fringe elements. - You tell Fuzzy for me that those are some very talented people. - If you don't change your friends, you'll get nothing from him. - Rich, will you make sure the oven's off? I'm sorry, I have to go. - Oh... - Oh, looks like Cupid's been busy as a bull dyke. You look beautiful, honey. - Hello. What are you doing? Thought you weren't gonna paint anymore. - Oh, look, it's Judy Garland. Wouldn't it be funny if it turned out she was really a man? - Wouldn't it be funny if it turned out Gerard was really a man? - When you get through sucking on that, come over and see for yourself. - Only if I can record the slurps. - Oh, Andy, Sam called. He's sending a limo for us for the show tonight. - I hear rock stars like limos. - I think it's just delicious that Edie has a boyfriend. - I'm not looking for anything like that. - Oh, okay. - Don't be jealous, Andy. - He's nothing like you. - Oh no, I'm not. I've just never made it with a rock star before. It must be neat. - I'm not making it... - Why do you do that? Why do you have to make me feel guilty? I hate it when people make me feel bad. - Well, you lied to me. - You said you didn't talk to him, and then that picture in the paper... - Andy, this is absurd. - It was a photograph. You know, we barely met. You meet people all the time. Do you fuck them? - Well, I just think sex is too abstract anyway. - Andy, what do you think about the war in Vietnam? - I don't know, ask Edie. - What do you think, Edie? - Well, we prefer I Dream of Jeannie. - Andy, in the story of your life, who would you want to play Andy Warhol? - Oh, Edie. - She's so perfect. She does everything better than me. - Hi. - Hello. - Andy, I need to talk to you. I've gotten myself into a little pickle, and I was just wondering if you could maybe pay me for some of my work? - Edie, you know the movies haven't made any money yet. So you just need to be patient. - Well, I can't be patient. - I have nothing to live on. - Andy, you and I both know... - Sam. - ...that you are never giving up painting. You've just been saying that to get publicity. Well, guess what. - What? - It worked. - Great. - Come on, everyone wants to meet you. This way. - Hello, kitty-kat. - Hello. That's a wonderful scarf. - Thank you. Left my tux in the shop. - You here to buy a painting? - Tell me, why are all these cats gonna pay a fortune for a soup can? I mean... - You just have to look beyond the obvious. - Am I stupid, or... - I don't get it. - Am I stupid? - You're being a little stupid. I mean, don't you think it's intriguing? Not just a little bit? You know, it may just be a painting, but it's an idea. And the man behind that idea is what's interesting. - I think the man has got his priorities all out of whack. Whole world's burning up, and this cat's making... gods out of garbage. - Well, the whole world may be burning up, but that doesn't mean that we have to be cynical. You see, when I look at my drink, I don't see that it's half empty. - What, it's half full? - No. Oh, no, it's time for you to go to the bar to get me another. There, your smile. - Got the whole world on a string, don't you? But inside there... Well, it's as empty as your friend's soup can. I'll see you around... Superstar. - Well, you're just so smart, Chuck. I just think you should start directing. I mean, you did the camera so good. We always need people like you just to make things happen. - Well, I mean, I'm really just here for Edie, you know? - Oh. Well, it's just such a pity that she should get all the attention when you're the one who found her. I hope she still wants to do more movies. - She does. We do, we love movies. I mean, in fact, I had this... - I just don't know if she's being... Well, I mean, you know her better than me. But, it seems like when the camera's on sometimes she just doesn't seem... I don't know, I just wouldn't want it to be disappointing. - It won't. I can have her say anything you want. She trusts me more than anyone. - Oh. - Yeah. - Oh yeah, that's much better. It's less baggy. - Did I smudge it? - There. Darling, you look fabulous. El fabulisimo grande. - Hey, Andy? We're ready. - Okay. - Beauty Number Two, an Andy Warhol production. - Daddy, will you pass me my martini? - Edie? - Yes, Chuckles? Chuckles, didn't I give you that name? Edie, do you like horses? - Horses have whiskers. - Yes, horses. Do you ride? - Since I was a little girl, I've just adored them. Daddy taught me to ride before I could walk. My first horse... - Your father was a handsome man? - Oh, Fuzzy? He still is. - How about your brothers? They were quite attractive, too, weren't they? They must have had a lot of women then. - What? - Did they find you attractive? - Of course. - I was their family. - Did you find them attractive? Do you... - Can you change the question? - Find Gino attractive? That's what I was going to ask you, Edie. - Gino? He's devastatingly handsome, isn't he? - Kiss him. Are you scared? Come on, Edie. Like you mean it. Gino, she likes when you get rough. She likes those tough men. Strong men are what turn you on, isn't that right, babycakes? - No. - Not like your brother Minty. Your father wasn't so keen on him, was he? Who was he keen on? You? - Okay, enough! Enough! Andy, are we finished? - No, Edie, we're still rolling. We'll send you one of our brand-new WNYJ baseball caps. I don't know if it's a boy or a girl, I can't tell by the name anyway. And it's 56 degrees in New York. How's the traffic? - Okay, it's looking clear. - Sedgwick! Edie Sedgwick! - Hello. - What, are you trying to kill me? How'd a nice chick like you get mixed up in the whole acting racket? - It was Breakfast at Tiffany's. You know that poster with Audrey and her hair's pulled back and she's smoking through the black cigarette holder? - You want to live in a movie? - I never saw the movie. So then you haven't read the book? - Well, Audrey isn't in the book. - Book's a bit different. Book's about a working girl and a writer. An artist. You see, the artist steals the girl's stories, makes a fortune, and the girl doesn't get anything. - Why do you have such a problem with Andy? - Because of what he worships. - And what about you? I mean, I saw your face in those flashbulbs. You pretend to be some sort of crusader, but I saw you basking in it. - Oh, don't get us confused, sister, all right? Those bulbs, they get a message out. - What exactly is the message aside from "Look at me"? - Nah, I'm just a guitar player. - That's all. - No no. You're an overpaid prophet and I'm a poor little rich girl. - Lady, you don't know shit about shit. Open your eyes, you know? Take a look at the world around you. - It's very easy for you... - It's not all Park Avenue. You do know that, don't you? - ...from your wonderful, very glorified position where you have your cars and your houses and your fucking bike. - You think I give a shit about any of this? - I think... - You think I actually care? - It's obvious you do. - It's not real, babe. Big house? - Big house. - Big family, too? - Big family. - Tell me about your house. We lived on a ranch. We lived on two ranches in California. - Two ranches? - Two ranches with... - Must have been a big family. - It was a big family. We had horses and cattle, and we had... - Lots of brothers and sisters? - We had eight brothers and sisters. Now I have six brothers and sisters. - Well, what happened to the other two? - Minty... hanged himself at a place called Silver Hill, which was sort of... a rehabilitation center. And... - Bobby... - Jesus. - ...who was my elder brother, ran his bike into a bus on Fifth Avenue. But the funny thing was was that I was in a car accident on the same, it was New Year's Eve and... Well, he died, and I didn't die. - Babe. - I was out with a couple of heavies tonight. We talked about you all evening. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, guess who. - Diana Vreeland? - No. - John Lennon? - No. - Edie Sedgwick? - No, I haven't seen her. Don't know where she is. - Hey, you wanna hear my new idea for a movie? - Think I can invite her for dinner? - Who? - Edie. - You wanna introduce her to your mother? Why? - Well, I hadn't thought, I don't know. Might be nice. - Geez, Andy, you must really miss her. You never invite anybody else over. - Oh, cut it out. - You can't be that mean. - Well, you never invited me over. - You need to lose 25 pounds first. My mother's not gonna feed you. She's nastier than you are. - She is not! - I draw too, like Andy. - Oh, you do? - My husband work in coal mine back then, yeah? And he very, very good-looking. Beautiful white hair. Every girl want this boy, but he want me. But I no want. - Well, why didn't you want him? - I 15. - Oh. - But then one day, he bring chocolate... For purposes to marry him. So for this candy, I marry him. Oh! You make my Andy so very happy. - Oh. - Oh, my special boy. With you, I think, all his skin blotches go away. - Mama, dost. - Let me help you with that. - You the boss, applesauce. - You know, Andy, I've been spending a lot of time with Billy. And I think that the more I think about it, I really think that you should meet. You'd really like each other. - Why would he want to meet me? - Well, because you're a genius. And he's a genius. Well, isn't he a genius, Julia? - Oh, my boy a genius. - Can you imagine how, I mean, if we made a movie or something, wouldn't that be fun, how explosive that would be? I just think if we took him to The Factory everybody would respond very well. Plus, he'd look beautiful. - Edie, I just wanted to get that for you. I know it's only $50, but, well, I just like the word "genius". I just think you should say it over and over. - Genius, genius, genius, genius... - Yeah, I dream of genius. - Genius? - He used that word? That sounds like your word. - Well, genius, brilliant, superstar, they're just words. What's important is the sentiment. - What's important is the word. - Well... You say you want to make a movie with me, let's make a movie. - Why? You want to make a movie with me, I need to know why. - Oh, babycakes. You're gonna hurt that enormous brain of yours with all that thinking you do. Oh, Andy, don't be nervous. - Oh, he's here. Chuck, get the camera ready, he's here. - Oh, hello. - There she is, baby. - You know Andy. - Hey. - Say hello, this is Andy. - Hi. Oh, you're such a beauty. Oh, here, would you sign my book? - Yeah, man. - Oh, great. Thank you. - So, this is everybody. This is The Factory. Should we start? What do you think? - Yeah, let's... - I think we should discuss salary in the beginning so there's no misunderstanding. - Oh, Drenna never pays the actors. - You expect him to work for free? I could give him $11. - $11? He's got $11. $11. Maybe we just take 11 of these instead. - No, man. Don't sweat it. I think my grandma's got like 11 of these stacked in her basement, you know? So... So... - Oh, oh, oh, you want to make a movie? - Oh, yeah. - Where do we start, Andy? - Yeah, do you want to just sit down here in front of the camera? - You know what, man? Nah, I don't wanna sit. Can I just stand in front of the chair? - Oh, yeah. I mean, you know, you can do whatever. It's your screen test. - No, it's not. It's yours. Come on, man, direct me. - Well, sit down. - I'm sorry. - You could just look at the camera maybe. - Yeah, I could do it. So this is where you work? This is where you paint your cans of beans or whatever? - Yeah. - It's a big space, man. - Thanks. - Right in the city. Must be real expensive. - Oh, no. - No, it's not. - Guy like you... must be really generous? I mean... - No. - Taking care of all these people. Do you smoke, man, or you just do that faggy speed shit? - Just the "faggy speed shit." - Come on, man. No, man. Keep it, that's for you. - Here. - Yeah. - I think we got it. - Well, great. Yeah, that was so interesting. Thanks. - Don't you think, Chuck? - Yeah. - Okay. - Got everything you want? - Oh, yeah, it was neat. - All right. - Thanks. - Let's split. - Well, I guess you can't have your cake and Edie too? - What the hell was that? You understand that... - He's your what? - He's my friend. - He's your friend? - He's my friend. - Baby, your friend is a bloodsucker, you know that? You're his prop. Okay? You're disposable to him. Man, you should fucking hate him. He'll fucking kill you. - I can't hate him! - Come on, man. Let me out. I'm not kidding, man. Let me out. Edie, come on. Come with me. You're so scared, baby. You're so scared of losing everything that doesn't mean anything. Take care of yourself, babe. - It was the biggest mistake of my life. He was the first and the last person that I ever loved like that. And I know everyone says that about their first, but when he and I were together it felt perfect. - Are you filming right now? Oh. So this is the movies. - Andy, Andy, I saw the craziest thing. - I always thought they'd be bigger. - Do you want me to talk? - Ingrid, tell us another one of your hilarious stories. - You're going to be such a big star. - Ingrid Superstar! - Well, you know, I've never done nothing like this before. - Just be like Edie. - Except the part where she takes too many drugs. Is there another part? - Oh no, I don't do the heavy stuff. - I think Edie and Ingrid look like sisters. - Andy, she doesn't look anything like me. - Andy, she doesn't look anything like me. - Oh. The resemblance is uncanny. - Tell me about the first time a boy touched you. - Oh yeah, Charlie Connell paid me a nickel to put his hand up my dress. After that, it was so easy I charged all his friends a dime. Seriously, by the time I was 15, between me and my friend, we had 68 bucks, which was enough for a bus ticket and cab fare and a hot meal at Cafe Figaro, where you guys picked me up. - Miss Sedgwick, open up! Miss Sedgwick! - Merry Christmas, Mrs. Whitley. - Christmas was last week, Miss Sedgwick. So was December. November was the month before that. And we all know when October was. Happy New Year. Your rent's three months late. - Taxi! - I need money, James. I need it now. - It's all spent, Miss Sedgwick. - I need to pay for my apartment. - Your father pays half your rent every month, period. He calls it tough love. In my opinion, young lady, he's been quite generous. - You want to know what tough love was for me, James? Trying to keep my father out of my bed since I was eight years old. - My God. Does your mother know? Did you ever tell her? - Yeah. - What did she say? - Nothing. - Miss Sedg... Edie, I can help you. You can have what I've got here. Oh, child, child. Child. - Hello? Andy, it's Edie! He's not here. - So, Silver... Can I borrow some money? - Yeah. Let me have 50, and I'll give you 10. - I'm serious. - You know, sweets... Andy's not the only game in town. I have a friend Max. He's friends with a friend who knows Alfred Hitchcock. I think it could be good for your career. - I started to scheme about how to get drugs. I shot heroin to come down from speed and keep the big sadness at ba. But I got completely out of control. - She really is like a glamorous Viking, isn't she? - An East Berlin original. - You're so beautiful. - Well, we're sponsoring a new band. Oh, what are they called? - The Velvet Underground. - Oh, yeah. And since I don't believe in painting anymore, we thought it would be a nice... - A way of combining music, films and art. - Nico, how about a photo? - Hello, M-Mum-mum. - How are you, dear? - Is Fuzzy there? - You're not going to ask for money, are you, honey? - No, no. I just wanted to say hello. - Oh, yes, of course. - Let me get him. Fuzzy, darling, it's Edith on the phone. - You talk to her. - You've got to talk to her. - Fuzzy. - It sounds like she's desperate. - I hate the bitch. - Talk to her, she's your daughter. - Tell her to go make her movies. - He'd love to talk, darling, but he's tied up at the moment. - Take care, Mum-mum. - Call you right back, okay? - I'm just so tired. - Andy Warhol superstar-slash-socialite Edie Sedgwick was taken to Lenox Hospital today after starting a fire. - She almost burned down the whole fucking place. - She suffered first-degree burns on her arms and legs. - What do you want me to do? - I don't know. See if she needs anything. I'd help her if I could. - What's up, baby? - Richie, honey, I need to ask you a favor. Richie, darling! It's been ages. How's your father? - He just bought my mother a 10-carat stone. If anyone else, you'd think he was screwing the Rockettes. Diana, I'm calling about Edie Sedgwick. - Yes? - She's been trying to reach you. I have her here. I'm gonna put her on. - Hello. - Edie. Divine one, how are you? Your pictures were incredible. I'm afraid we can't sign you right now, darling. - Why not? - The board feels, they feel... Andy Warhol's mise-en-scene, it's become too seedy. The drugs, darling, the riffraff. The patina is damaged. They think you've become vulgar. - Vulgar? How? - I don't know, but it's better than being boring. Now do take care of yourself. - You what? - I hope you're happy. Everyone in New York is laughing at me. I can't leave my apartment. I can't get a job. Your movies have made a fool out of me. - Oh, no. - They've made you famous, Edie, and that's what you wanted. - No one will have anything to do with me because of you. - But every teenage girl from Jersey wants to look like you, Edie. - Andy, I have nothing. You owe me that money. I need that money. - But I gave you $50. I gave you money. Did you spend it already? - 50 fucking dollars? - Well, I'm sure if you wait a year or two, someone from Hollywood will put you in a movie with Tony Perkins. And then you can earn all the money you want and spend all that too. - You think that I'll go to Hollywood? You think I can't function without you? I'll be fucking fine. - Are you going to live there with your boyfriend and his wife? - You filthy, filthy, fucking... - Edie, enough! - You fucked me up! - That's enough! - It's your Factory! You fucked me up, and you know it! You look at me. Look at me! Look at me! - Enough, enough. - Look at what you've created! You're the boss, applesauce. - Andy... Who is this you are talking about? - I don't know what to say to her anymore. And I don't know what I did. She's such a beautiful girl, but it's like she just wants to be ugly now. I don't understand why anybody would want that. How do you stop somebody from not doing something if they don't want to? - Well, we will say a prayer for her and then we will go and light a candle. - I never met anybody like her before. - Who is he? Don't you remember? This is my friend Max. The guy who knows the guy who knows Alfred Hitchcock. - Oh, right. Is your friend stealing my silverware? - No, he's just borrowing it. Is that okay? - Just because I let your friend fuck me last night doesn't mean that he can take my silver. Did he film it? - Yes, and you were great. Are you done? - Yeah, that's a wrap. - How do I look? - You look groovy. Hey, Edie, can he borrow your coat? - That looks really good on you. - Thanks. - All right, sweets, I gotta go. - Don't go. Don't leave me now. Maybe I'll come back later. Don't forget to blow out all these candles. God, maybe you should just sort of... Ciao. Take off her coat, man. - She said I could borrow it. - No, no, no. - Either you take it off or I'm gonna take it off for you. It's your choice. - Hey, man, she just said that he could borrow- - Take off the fucking coat! - Hey, man, just mellow out, man. - Now get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here! - Okay. We were just leaving, man. - Don't fuckin' touch me. - Peace, man, hey, yeah. Bye, Edie. - Syd, is that you? - Let me see. What are you doing? - I said it all to him. I told him. I said it to Andy. I said it all to him. Is that why you're here? Are we going upstate like he said? 'Cause if we are, I just need to put a few things into a bag. - He's out of town, all right? But maybe, maybe when he gets back. All right? - Did my father call you? Is that why? Is he gonna lock me up again? - No. - Oh, Syd, will you stay the night with me? - No. Edie. - Lately, I... I feel like I'm gonna die. - You're not gonna die, Edie. You're gonna be fine. I promise. - Yeah? - Yeah. Hey, how about I buy you something to eat? Can I do that? - Looks like an accident. It may be a while. - Where are we going, Syd? - I want to show you something. Do you remember that girl? - Yeah. What was I thinking? - The only reason I ever went to that class was because of you. It's true. Do you remember her? - No. - Edie! - I'm not saying that anyone else is responsible. I made decisions, life decisions that I regret. But I really feel like I can do this. I can stay off the drugs, and I realize that it will be a battle every day, but... so far so good, right? But I'm home. Santa Barbara is my home. And I have a small show. Did I tell you that? I mean, it's nothing major. It's just in a frame shop, but it's something. - Well, I just think people forgot what emotions were supposed to be. I mean, it's too hard to care. I mean, you know, I still care, but it would just be so much nicer not to care. It's just easier being detached. - What about Edie? - Oh, what about Edie? I haven't seen her in years. - You know she died yesterday? - Oh, yeah. - Do you think your breakup had something to do with that detachment? - Well, it wasn't a breakup. I mean, that makes it sound like we were... I mean, this is gonna be really hard if we have to... You know, it was just so long ago. I mean, I hardly knew her at all, so. I wonder if people are gonna remember us. - What, when we're dead? - Yeah. - Well, I think people will talk about how you changed the world. - I wonder what they'll say about you in your obituary. I like that word. - Nothing nice, I don't think. - Oh, no, come on. It'd say, "Edith Minturn Sedgwick, beautiful artist and actress.." - "And all-around loon." - "Remembered for setting the world on fire." - "And escaping the clutches of her terrifying family." - "Made friends with everybody and anybody." - "Creating chaos and uproar wherever she went. Divorced as many times as she married, she leaves only good wishes behind." That's nice, isn't it? - Edie seemed to understand from the beginning her life was going to be short. She was a blip on the radar suddenly. It just blew out everybody. You would walk into a room and Edie was there. Edie was what you saw. - There was something so vulnerable about Edie. She was a person that everybody adored and kind of worshipped, but you knew that she was basically fragile. - Time sort of stopped when you were with her. She was an exquisite creature. She had sort of a gamine look. Very long legs, very pale face, very pale lips. And a waif, in a way. And I think probably the weakness of her showed there. Andy was very struck by her, and, Andy would always invite somebody, to say, "Would you want to be in one of my movies?" And of course, Edie took Andy very seriously on that. - Who was Edie Sedgwick? Edie Sedgwick was a combination of all the tragic women who came before her. - She looked great in front of a camera. And she loved being in front of one. - Edie was taken advantage of, and hugely because she was so loving and trusting. She was very trusting. - She looked into your eyes. She listened to what you had to say. She made you believe that you were the most important person to her or on the planet. - Yeah, I think Edie took on Andy as the father that she didn't have. - Everybody I know that really knew her wanted to save her. That was one of the things, trying to keep her off drugs, trying to get her to pull her life together. - If you said "I love you," she just brightened up. So you got an immediate response, and I think that's how she caught people really strongly. - She had her own sense of style, which no one had ever seen before. She invented an entirely new look. - She inspired us all to want to take care of her. But believe me, that was some job. - And of course, she had a terrible time with drugs and also the character that comes with that. Endless searching through her bag to try to find a key or to try to find lipstick or whatever. But still enchanting anyway.
