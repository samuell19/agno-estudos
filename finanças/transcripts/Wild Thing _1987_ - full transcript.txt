She strings rosary beads. What's it to you? You're not as tough as you think you are, Lisa. There are people out here who'd eat you for breakfast. Like who? (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) BOY: Yes, sir.

I hope I have some clothes left in here. What... Jesus! What? Father, that's one of the men that attacked me last night. -You sure? -Yes, I'm sure. What are we gonna do? Gonna work in the Zone, you might as well meet the competition here. Those guys came up short. I don't want have to make the rounds. Hey, Father, what's up? Having another bake sale? She says your boy here attacked her last night. No, Dink wouldn't do a thing like that, would you, Dink? (SCOFFS) Never. CHOPPER: Uh, besides him and maybe another dozen reliable type people were over at my apartment all last night. I just got it redecorated. I wanted to show it off.

They said you saw the Wild Thing. Well, yeah. I think I did. Why? Have you ever seen him? I thought I did one night. I was messed up on crack though. So who knows? -What's crack? -(CHUCKLES) Where'd they get you from? Stevens Point. -It's in the middle of... -Wisconsin. -I know. -Why? Have you been there? Close enough. Grew up in Green Bay.

I mean, they get very personal, these decorators. It's like going to a shrink. He says that I'm entering a new phase in my life. "Serenity", he says, "that's the ticket." So down come the centerfolds from Easyrider magazine, down come the beer ads and up goes this. Well... What have we here? I'll kill that little twitch when they find her.

Something happened? Something bad happened? They were... They were shot? Killed? They were shot. Somebody shot them. And... And the police caught them. No? Police shot your parents? One.

We'll bring in a chimpanzee to translate. -We should go to the cops. -Go to the cops an hour later the house gets torched. -That doesn't mean they're in on it. -Sure. Look, Lisa, I'm just trying to take care of you. You can barely get yourself up in the morning. How are you going to take care of me? Come on. -He couldn't have set the fire, he was with me. -Oh, yeah? Where was that? It was on the streets. Look, miss, right now this guy is our number one suspect. He isn't saying anything in his own defense. Yeah, well, that's because he is afraid of the uniforms. Oh, he is afraid of the uni... Oh, that's interesting, I never heard that before. Yeah.

You've been dipping into the contraband down there, Trask? How do you figure? The girl, the social worker, whatever. She was talking to me. He remembers us. (EXHALES) Well, then the ball's in your court, huh? -What do you mean? -Well, he's in your jail. -Right. -Jail is a dangerous place. No. No, you've been bleeding me for too long. I ain't gonna kill nobody for you. Not for me. For us. We've come a long way, friend, by looking out for each other, huh? (SCOFFS) You know, I'm thinking all these years... And this kid is alive. (LAUGHING) I mean, I've been having nightmares about this kid drowning in the water. (CLICKS TONGUE) Well, you've already done the time, you may us well do the crime. I should have killed you. Then you wouldn't have anybody to look out for you. Yeah... (ENGINE STARTS) What was that all about? Conscience. You always said you can do anybody, anyplace, anytime. Within limits, yeah.

(SIGHS) You got away. -You okay? -(EXCLAIMS SOFTLY) I'm sorry. (EXHALES HEAVILY) To get to the monkey boy we have to get to the social worker. To get to the social worker, we got to get to the kids.

Sleep seeing I'm with Leah again. I see her burning. Ah, it's a dream. It can't hurt you. No, it hurts here. Sparks in the power station. You're always talking about electricity. Leah taught me. She learnt when the company put it through her head. They put electricity through her head? To make her be like them. If you're the wrong voltage, you can't fit in their socket. If you're the wrong voltage, you try to live with them, sparks! Blackout in the power station. Have you ever wanted to be with other people? Who's that? Is that me? (LAUGHS) It's nice. You make me feel... Like this. -That's just because you haven't seen that many women. -Yes, I have. I've seen as many women as there are cockroaches. None of them make me feel like this. Do you know what... ...men and women do... Together? Body bump? Is that what you call it? I've seen it. (MIMICS KISSING) (MOANING) (SCREAMING) It hurts? Well, not really. Sounds like it hurts.

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) This one we can squeeze. Pick him up. -You got it. -(ENGINE STARTS) Night time on top, day time underneath. -They say there're alligators down here. -Alligators? They're kind of long, green and... Knobby with big jaws. -No alligators, only devils. -Devils? (SQUEAKING) Get thee behind me, Satan! Oh! -Devils! -Devils. If you go back, they'll hurt you again. That's one of the chances you take when you live with other people. You take care of yourself. -I really think you should be nice to us, Paulie, huh? -Oh, yeah. After all, the good shit we sold you, huh? Look man, I told you. I don't do that shit anymore. Sure! The thing is, Paulie, we know who your hot girlfriend is. And we can do a real number on her, huh? Huh? Yeah, but we just want the social worker, kid, you know? Don't or you'll be pushing pencils out of a cup, Paulie. Huh? Look, you promised you won't hurt Lisa. (LAUGHS) Never. Never. Trask, 45, was found in his office last night, an apparent murder victim. What, if any, connection his death has with the Wild Thing case is still unknown. Meanwhile, police continue to scour city streets, in search of the Wild Thing. They really expect us to find the Wild Thing on the streets? Nah. They just want to keep us out of the station house. Keeps the reporters away from asking about Trask. Do you think this Wild Thing is still around? Yeah. Yeah. And I got a feeling it's is going to be a long night. We've caught her. Wait till she comes out with the others. Chopper said no loose ends. Well, there's no way I go to the cops. That's out. Okay. If I give you a ticket, will you leave town? And go where? I have a friend in Boston, who runs a place for kids. -Yeah. Anything beats this dump. -Good. Okay, Father. I'm going to take them down to the station. -You trust us? -Should I? None of this is your fault, Father. You've been good to me. -Be careful. -Okay. Come on, let's go. How are you doing all this and you're not even a nun? Because I like this.

You didn't see all them ambulances all filled up. -But he dead, man. -You believe that? I've seen it on the news. Man went down in the river. You try and stay out all night in the Zone sometime. You'll see. Wild Thing got nine lives, sucker. Only used but one or two. Come out here some night. You think you see a shadow moving, you think you hear some voice singing all high and pretty. That's Wild Thing, man. Wild Thing lives, man!
