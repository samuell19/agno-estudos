- End of the week. They'll be at it all night. (horn blowing) (distant drumming) (frantic drumming) (screaming) Do you see what we're up against? Pre-historic savages. I think we've seen enough. Kevin? (frantic drumming) (screaming) - [Voiceover] Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! - Do you see what I was telling you? - What is there to see? - The Dimbala, Presidente. (frantic drumming) (screaming) - President has forbidden the practice of voodoo. You should know that, Simone. - I know Colonel Esteve, but look! (frantic drumming) (screaming) - [Presidente] Who is she? - [Simone] She's called Mama Dora, Presidente. The people from the island are under the spell of her magic. (frantic drumming) (screaming) These are our people, Presidente. They've brought back the old ways from the island. - [Presidente] All of the old ways? - [Simone] Yes. Before the night is over, a man will be skinned alive. - What do you suggest we do about it? - Stop them! How can we move forward as a nation if we can't free ourselves from the ways of the past? Presidente, please understand, the Makumba is stronger than ever. Only you can stop them. - I'm afraid Simone exaggerates, Presidente. - We are in America, Simone. - Look! You've got to stop them! (frantic drumming) (screaming) (tense music) No! (squelching) (frantic drumming) (screaming) (screaming) (squelching) (screaming) (energetic electronic music) - Morning, Barney. - Hi, Jane. - Getting ready for the marathon, huh? - Yup. - I bet you'll do great. - [Barney] I hope so. Is Llewellyn in? - Not yet. - Would you tell Llewellyn I'd like to see him when he gets here? - Sure, are you here for the day? - No, I'm gonna do a couple of hours in the park at lunchtime, why? - You really should follow up on the Brighton account. They're waiting to hear back from you. - Let me jump in the shower and then we'll get 'em on the phone. All right? - All right, Barney, you tell me when. - 10 minutes, okay? - Okay. (gasps and yelps) Harold, you startled me. - Give it up, Jane, he's getting married Thursday. - Oh, Mr. Llewellyn, you're really-- - The boss's son would be quite a catch, but don't forget the boss is dead and this dodo doesn't know what he's doing. - Well, give him a chance, Harold. He's only been here for six months. - And he hasn't generated enough business to keep him in jock straps. - He'll be closing the Brighton account this morning. - Excuse me if I don't jump for joy. - Mr. Brighton, good morning. That's right. Well, according to my figures, your employees are working for you between nine and four. It's why we call these burglar's hours. That's right, burglar's hour. Mr. Brighton, you have more than 9,000 people working for you. The odds are that on average that five of them will be robbed or vandalized each and every month. Are you aware of the kind of stress this creates? Has a very bad effect on your cost effectiveness ratio. - Oh, Harold, that is not fair. Barney didn't ask to inherit this business. He is doing the best he can. - His best is not even going to keep us equal with the competition. The kid has to buckle down and get involved with moving this company into the future. His father would have-- - His father died in the middle of a meeting about moving this company into the future, Harold. - Jane, I've got three new weapons and two security programs in development. And who do I have to push them forward? A would-be Ironman with three college degrees and six months' experience in a real world, six months that has put us into the red ink for the first time in 20 years. - Now, we're prepared to offer you both personal security systems for each of your employees at an individual rate that's gonna put your bottom line problems to rest. Well, our least expensive model is the barking door bell. Yes, that's right, a barking door bell. Well, whenever somebody rings the bell, the system plays a recording of a large dog barking. Hello? Hello, Mr. Brighton? (tense music) - Let her go. - You best be on your way, friend, or you can kiss your arms and your legs goodbye. (woman gasps) (yelling) (punching) (grunting) (punching) (grunting) (gun clicks) (whooshing) (tense music) - Waldo Warren's as good as they said he was. Any suggestions? - Kill him. - Always the obvious. - Thank you, but I can take care of myself now. - Whatever you want. - It was no accident that you were there, was it? - What can I say? - The truth? I mean, that flying knife wasn't exactly standard issue good Samaritan equipment. - Okay, somebody asked me to look after you. - Who? - Sorry, business. - Business? I think we're talking about my life. - You know more about that than I would. - So, you know who I am? - What's to know? You're a girl with lots of mommy and daddy's money, and if somebody steals you, they'll be on Easy Street, if it works. - So wrong, so wrong. (pensive music) - [Harold] Hadley Shipping is the first account your father ever had. Even with the times as tight as they are, old man Hadley still keeps sending that retainer like clockwork. - That's fine, Harold, but what about these accounts paid? - What do you wanna know? - Well, for a start, how the hell do you think we're gonna pay for all of them? - Research and development has always operated separately under (mumbling). - I understand that, but I'm looking at $2,000,000 built out for bodyguards and security. - So, what's wrong with that? - So, I have nearly that much in research and development bills alone. I mean, what is this? Look, what is this? Experimental animals, purchase and maintenance. Are we torturing defenseless creatures? - We're training drug and explosive detection dogs, Barney. - Oh, well, they sure as hell gonna have to do better than those door bells. - Are you trying to tell me something? - I'm telling you that if we don't land a major account within the next few days, Sanford Security Systems is finished, over. - What happened with Brighton Industries? - They decided to go in another direction. You know. - So, we're close to packing it in? This happened before, you know that. - And my father saved us, right? - I didn't say that, Barney. - But that's what you were thinking. - Barney, all I was thinking was that maybe this company isn't the one you were meant to run. - Harold, I've watched you and my dad work in the lab since I was a kid. Okay, maybe I haven't been too involved in the past few years, but that doesn't mean I haven't cared. Just tell me what to do. I wanna make this work. Here, San Caribe, have you heard of it? - Of course, tropical island on the verge of revolution. You already have a basic security deal with them, nothing special. Who wants 'em? - Head of state, embassy reception. - Cocktail party, casual, you've done this before. - And a press conference. Should we take it? - Depends. It's a bad situation, a power play that could go either way. - So, which side's on the right? - We're not in the business of deciding the morals of a government. - We aren't? Why the hell aren't we? - (sighs) What are they asking for? - Bodyguard, top grade only, for the president, one year contract. Who do we have who can cover it? - Nobody. There is someone who can handle this. - So, what do we do? Sub-contract? If this guy isn't with us, how do we get him? - It isn't that easy. He was hurt once working for your father. I had to introduce a few experimental procedures while putting him back together. - Start in the middle, we haven't got all day. - He's a top bodyguard in the business. They call him the Gunman. He only works when he wants. - The Gunman? I like it. - He only works when he wants. - Harold, this money is too good for anyone to turn down. A bodyguard, plus his support system that we supply, I mean, just buy a right-around ticket. Who is this guy? - His name is Waldo Warren, and he can't be bought, Barney. - Harold, this is great. Don't you see? The company's on the verge of bankruptcy, only one man who can save us, and you tell me I can't buy him. - This is great? - Yeah! I finally have a chance to show everybody that I have what it takes to run Sanford Security Systems. I'll bring in a $1,000,000 contract. Press coverage from the embassy alone will generate all kinds of new business. - First, you have to get Waldo Warren. - Okay, where do I find him? (upbeat electronic music) (chattering) - I have to talk to you. - Not now. - Please! - Later. (upbeat electronic music) - Waldo Warren? - That's right. - Can we talk here? - If you want. Doesn't matter, we're being watched. - We are? Where? (upbeat electronic music) - I told you, it doesn't matter. The moment you took this job, you grew a tail. I thought this was your family business? Would you be more comfortable outside? - Yes, I think so. - Follow me. (door creaking) You ever been on a case like this before? - Wait a minute, I don't even know if you're gonna take it yet. - You haven't figured it out, have you? - I don't understand. - Your dad's been dead for six months now? - [Barney] Mm-hmm. - I got another six months to go on my contract. I'm already on the case. - Wait a minute, I know every piece of legal paper my father had. - Your dad and I go so far back, we didn't even need a handshake. - That's impossible. You're not much older than I am. - Sounds like you need to have a little chat with Harold. - I still don't understand. - If you got any problems, talk to Llewellyn. In the meantime, let's talk about what we have to deal with tonight. - Right. - These two again. This isn't even work. Let's get 'em, Barney. (suspenseful music) (slapping) (grunting) (punching) (grunting) (punching) (grunting) (punching) (loud thudding) - Who were those guys? - You got a contract, don't you? - What do you mean? - San Caribe. - Yeah? - Well, somebody wants to take you out. - But how could they find out? Nobody knows about this job except for the head of Secret Service. - Barney, you've got a lot to learn. (threatening music) (screeching warble) - Barney, help her! (screeching warble) (loud exploding) (sizzling) (threatening music) - Like I said, Barney, you've got a lot to learn. Nasty neighborhood. (ominous music) (mellow keyboard music) (chattering) - I thought you said this was gonna be casual. - Nothing is that casual. - Where's Waldo? - Don't worry, Barney, he's here. - I hope so. I'd hate to blow this one. - I think I liked you better before you cared how the company operated. - Well, after last night, I look at everything. (mellow keyboard music) - Mr. Llewellyn, how nice to see you. - Madam Davalos, the pleasure is ours. President Davalos, may I introduce you and your wife to Bernard Sanford? - Hello. - Sanford, you are with the security company? - He owns the company. - How do you do? I'm standing with two presidents then, am I? - I guess so. Hi, how do you do? - Oh, thank you. - So, Mr. Sanford, you are here to give me a life, yes? - We'll do our best, sir. - And just what does your best include for us this evening? - Well, we have-- - Madam Davalos, we have additional electronic security, as well as a double contingent of guards working with your people and the police. - Good, I assume you know that there's been an incident involving our daughter yesterday? - Yes, that was most unfortunate. I'm glad our operative was able to offer his assistance. - I Would like to meet this man. For some reason, our daughter took an instant dislike to him. - I'm sorry to hear that. He's here this evening. - [Madam Davalos] Where? - I'm not sure. When I contact him, I'll make sure that he's introduced to you. - Please do. Come, Henri, it's time to attend to our guests. By the way, Mr. Sanford, San Caribe is part of Hispaniola, not the South Seas. (mellow keyboard music) - Wow, is she a Dragon Lady, or what? - Whatever she is, it's on wheels. - Everything under control? - Seems to be. Harold, I wanted you to be aware of this. - What? - Ciprian Lane and the boys are here. - What? - Look. - [Harold] How the hell did they get in here? - [Jane] They had invitations, I checked. - Who are they? - Competition. - Jane, what a thing to say! - Well, they might as well be. - Isn't it about time for you to visit the powder room? - All right, all right, I can take a hint. Don't need to hit me over the head with a brick. - All right, Harold, who's Ciprian Lane, and what kind of name is that anyway? - Lithuanian, I think. - Come on, Harold. - Ciprian Lane runs a freelance government surveillance company. - You mean like ours? - Barney, it's nothing like ours. This guy would sell out his mother for the high bid. - Wasn't it you who said it wasn't our business to make moral decisions? - Barney, let me lay it out for you. This job we're on right now is what you might call judgmentally ambivalent. We're not taking the food out of the mouths of the starving poor. We're simply taking precautions to ensure that no one is killed or abducted during this evening's affair, and that no one is murdered on Thursday, during the government press conference. Other than that, our opinions are our own. - Oh, so we could be protecting the most corrupt regime on the island, and it wouldn't make any difference? - Sounds like you've been doing a little research. - Yeah, I've been reading. - And? - And our people sure better be on their toes because this government could be smashed by their own citizens before the last shipment of American aid is out of the country and into a Swiss bank account. - I hate to agree with you, but you're right, but we do need the contract. And there is a chance that some of the forces that work within the government can make a change. - What makes us any better than Ciprian Lane? - We know where to draw the line. - We do? - Yes, Barney, we do. We've never contracted with a fascist government, we've never dealt with the communists, and more important than anything, we've never been for hire on an elimination. - An elimination? You're kidding. - No, Barney, I'm not. - Ciprian Lane's company does that kind of thing? - A lot of companies do. - Then what the hell is he doing here? - We'll find that out soon enough. (mellow keyboard music) (chattering) - Having a good time? - I'm doing all right. - I should have known. My parents are paying you, aren't they? - Not that simple. - How much simpler could it be? They know, don't they? - Know what? - (sighs) Don't give me that. They know, and so do you. - Anjanette, why don't you just let me look after you? You can have a drink, talk with a few people, and then call it a night. - (laughs) Oh, sure, and then everything will remain business as usual? You must think I'm a fool! - I'm just here to make sure you don't get hurt. - How? By the Dimbala? Did they feed you that old voodoo line? Crazed island natives trying to kill the leaders of their country? - There is talk of a revolution, you know that. - And what if I was a part of it? What would you think then? That I was some sort of voodoo priestess with the Makumba blood lust? Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but all I want is for the people of my country to get help. I mean, your government has poured a lot of money into our treasury, and practically none of it has reached the people. Look at my mother. She's wearing enough jewels to feed more than half the children of my country. - [Waldo] So, you'd be happy if your family was no longer running San Caribe? - Draw your own conclusions. (tense music) - Colonel Esteve, how nice to see you. Jane Maynord, Sanford Security Systems. I delivered you the final contract. - Oh, of course, Ms. Maynord. It's a pleasure to see you again. - Thank you. - As you can see, President Davalos, we have covered all the main points of illegal entry. We've also trained cameras on the regular entrances and exits to the embassy so that the identity of your visitors and service people can be monitored. - Very impressive, Mr. Llewellyn. I'm sure my wife will be pleased. - Ciprian, just how did you manage to get in here? - Harold, you know you can do anything if you put your mind to it. President. - Mr. Llewellyn, I must admit that Mr. Lane is here at my invitation. - [Harold] Oh? - Yes, Mr. Lane approached me when Mr. Sanford died. He has offered to supply security for our government at a price slightly lower than the contract that we made with your company. - I see. - Although we have been very happy with the service you have provided, as the representative of the government concern, it is my duty to see what other company are able to give us. - Of course you understand that some of what Mr. Lane could see is confidential, and available only from Sanford Security Systems. - I do. - Harold, I assure you, anything you don't want me to see will remain private. - Thank you. - And you are? - Ciprian, this is Bernard Sanford, the new president of Triple S. - Such a young man for such a big job. - How do you do? - Fine, thanks. - Ciprian, you wanted to see what we're using? Let's start the tour. - I believe we have a branch in your country, in Caracas? - Caracas is in Venezuela. - Oh, that's right, Venezuela. I'm sorry, I... I've never been to San Caribe, but I hear it is a magnificent country, and the Andes-- - The Andes are in Chile. - Of course, I should have known that. I saw a book recently of Latin America, and there were some interesting photos of your ancient pyramids. - Ms. Maynord, there are no pyramids in San Caribe. - Oh, are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. - Oh. (sighs) (tense music) - That's it, Ciprian. The rest is top secret, sorry. - Thank you, Harold, I'm impressed. You are very well-covered on all sides that I can see, President. When one adds that to whatever Mr. Llewellyn has chosen to keep under cover, I'm sure your embassy is being protected by the most professional people in the business, aside from us, of course. Harold, my compliments. I couldn't have done a better job myself. Now I can't wait to see what you're keeping to yourself. Enjoy the evening. - That was painless. - Don't be too sure. Lane's always got a wildcard up his sleeve. - I am glad that the two of you agree on the safety of the system. You must know that the climate of our government is extremely volatile. - I don't think you'll have anything to worry about tonight, Presidente. - Can I get you something to drink? - No, thank you. I think I'd like some air. There's a balcony over there that overlooks 5th Avenue. - I'll follow you. It's nice out here. - You don't have to make conversation. I know I'm stuck with you for the evening. - Knock that chip off your shoulder, I mean it. - Sure you do, just like you believe in the Makumba? - I'm not even sure what that is. - Voodoo, Mr. Warren. - Call me Waldo. - All right, Waldo, it's still voodoo. People like you all think we run a country dripping with the blood of decapitated chickens. Some people want us to be better that way. - A lot of people in this country kill giant birds every year and eat them. We call it Thanksgiving. - I'm serious! San Caribe isn't a backward ignorant country! Now, of course we have those who believe in the Makumba, but there are many more who are concerned with the health and the welfare of our people! - You won't get an argument from me. - Good, because this government is about to change. Those of us who care about our people will soon be able to take control of our own destinies. (tense music) Who's that man? - You don't know him? - No, who is he? (tense music) - Let's go back inside. (chattering) - Good evening, Colonel Esteve. I see you have met the lovely lady who's accompanying us. - Why, Mr. Llewellyn, you do this woman an injustice. She is much more than lovely. Why, I would call her a beautiful flower who represents her country with grace and elegance. - Jane, would you like another drink? - The Colonel has already ordered drinks, Barney. - Yeah, sorry, later then. - Harold, have you met Miss Davalos? - A pleasure. - I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Llewellyn. Hello, Father, and your company. - Miss Davalos, this is Bernard Sanford. It is his security company you've heard about. - Mr. Sanford. - Anjanette, I was beginning to wonder if you were going to put in an appearance. - Mother, between displaying our wealth for the international community tonight and telling an interesting story at the press conference on Thursday, you know I wouldn't miss it for the world. - Anjanette, this is not the time for that kind of display. - Well, when is the time, Mother? - Marianna, Anjanette! - Jane, how 'bout a dance? - The orchestra isn't playing, Barney. - Father, I think it's time someone told you just what is happening. - Anjanette, what do you mean by that? - You know exactly what I mean, Mother. Father, not all the people who surround you are looking after your best interest. - Anjanette, I'm warning you to (mumbles). - What are you trying to say? - Father, I am telling you that there will be a revolution, and if you can't make the government change and accommodate the needs of the people, you will be finished. - You treacherous little traitor! You are talking to your father. - And my mother! You can't continue ignoring the people of San Caribe, you with your jewels and your receptions. Father, you must believe what I'm telling you. There will be a revolution. - Ridiculous, never! (guns firing) (screaming) (glass shattering) (threatening music) (loud exploding) - Don't move her! - Is she? - We'll have to wait and see. (tense music) - Sounds like it's over. We should go see what's happened. - Why, everybody's dead, aren't they? - Well, there's only one way to find out. (tense music) - Father! No! - Please, Anjanette, your father would not want you to see him like this. (speaking in foreign language) (sighing deeply) - Please, help me get her upstairs. (tense music) - Mr. Llewellyn, Mr. Llewellyn, Mr. Sanford, I think we have some work to do before Thursday's press conference. - Aside from a brief release, what on Earth is there for economic reporters to talk about? - We will proceed as planned. Madam Davalos will represent San Caribe in the interim. - The interim? - Of course, until new elections can be held, Madam Davalos will be the new leader of San Caribe. It goes without saying that your contract will remain enforced. What happened here tonight was not a simple breach of security. It was a full-fledged rebel assault by a military group. - Our company was prepared to deal with such a contingency. - This was not an ordinary breach of professional protection systems, Mr. Llewellyn. In no way do we consider your work to be second rate. - It's not our work that's in question here, Colonel, it's the ethics of presenting a government to world leaders and media two days after a massacre, as if you were conducting business as usual. - The guard in the surveillance room was murdered before the assault. - [Barney] What? - You heard me. - How do you know? - His blood was all over the monitor dials. Whoever killed him cut his throat and then turned off the monitors, before he wiped the blood off his hands. - This is outrageous. - Why would you say that? - Because this means that it was an, how do you say, an inside job. - That's what it sounds like. Have any idea who would be responsible for this, Colonel? - No, it can't be. - Colonel, if you know something, you have to tell us. - It's not possible. - [Barney] Please, Colonel, anything to help. - There's only one person who could possibly, no. - Who is it, Esteve? - The president's daughter, Anjanette. - How is she? - I thought she had a fever, but she seems to be sleeping peacefully now. Who are you? - Oh, you remember me, I brought your daughter up here. - I remember, that's not what I meant. - Getting over the shock? - You mean Henri? How could I ever... I know who you are. You're Waldo Warren. - And how did you figure that out? My daughter told me you were a big man with a bad attitude. - You're too kind. - What do you want? - You think your daughter wants you dead? - What are you saying? - She doesn't seem to agree with your politics. You think she'd kill you to get what she wants? - My husband is dead, Mr. Warren. Our daughter loved him. She would do nothing to harm either one of us. Get out! - Okay. Before I go, I think you should take a look at this. (ambulance siren blaring) - How much? - For what? - This is blackmail, isn't it? - Aren't you forgetting, lady, I'm still working for you. - That never stopped anybody, but... - Yes? - This proves nothing. - Then why don't we just bring it up at Thursday's press conference? - What? - You haven't heard? You're about to be installed the empress of San Caribe. You didn't plan it, did you? - You swine! I loved my husband, I loved him! I loved that man, I loved-- - What about this? - What about it? It's not the first lie linking me with the religious practices of San Caribe. - [Waldo] You wanna tell me about it? - There's nothing to say. There are some people from San Caribe who have come here, and they still believe in the Dimbala. I stand behind all my people, even them. - Enough to participate in their rituals? - Mister, whatever your name is, I was educated at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. (shouting in French) I have a degree in sociology from Princeton University. Do I look like the kind of person who would be a voodoo queen? - [Waldo] Now that you mention it, yes. (shouting in French) (crying) Now that we've got that out of the way, you wanna talk? (haunting music) - Are you ready? - For what? - The embassy, Barney, remember? Jane, a massacre, dead people? - Harold, don't do that. - Barney, you gotta do it, otherwise, you go nuts. - Okay, what are we doing? - We're going to the San Caribe Consulate to see if we can find out how in the hell we blew it. - I thought you said we didn't blow it? - Technically, we didn't, but if everybody doesn't get out alive, somebody's gotta take the rap. - I get it. Let's go. (tense music) - Colonel Esteve is expecting us. - Yes, sir. The embassy has been vacated except for the colonel. He asked if you would wait for him in the surveillance room. - Thank you. - This is really something, isn't it? - What? - You saw what this room looked like last night. If you didn't know any better, you'd never know what happened. Harold? - Just a minute. - What, what is it? - You said if you didn't know any better, you'd never know. - Yeah, so? - If you didn't know... - Harold, what are you getting at? - That's it, it was a setup! - But you already said that's what it was. - No, not an inside job, a real setup. - I don't understand. - A setup, Barney, the whole thing was a phony. - You were here last night. You saw dead bodies, you saw blood. - Sure, we did. Now we have to find out what really happened. (tense music) (screaming) (grunting) (yelling) (yelling) (grunting) (smashing) Chair. (gun fires) - Guns, gentlemen? What were you shooting at? Certainly not the help. - Are you kidding? Who works here, ninja butlers? - The consulate has been evacuated, Mr. Sanford. With the exception of myself and the security guard who admitted you, the building is empty. - In that case, you got a security guard who needs a seeing eye dog. - Where are Madam Davalos and her daughter? - They have, I'm afraid there's no other way to say this, gone into hiding. - What about tomorrow's press conference? - We will proceed as planned. - Where? - Here, of course. - Colonel Esteve, we are responsible for the safety of the Davalos family. I demand to know where they are! - Certainly, Mr. Llewellyn. I'm hardly trying to hide them from you. - Where the hell are they then? - (sighs) I'm afraid I'm going to be very happy when this security contract's up. - Get to the point! - Madam Davalos will be displeased if others know of this. - Know of what? - The Makumba. She could never rid herself of the old ways. - Do you have any idea what he's talking about? - Yes, voodoo. Go on, Colonel. - I see you are familiar with what we are dealing with, Mr. Llewellyn. - I am. - There's a building, an abandoned building near the river. Late at night, when the stars in the sky are in the proper place, people of San Caribe go there, and revert to the old ways. They become, you'll have to see for yourself. - Are you saying that Mrs. Davalos and her daughter are there? - I can really say nothing more. Even though you have been engaged to protect them, to go to that building tonight would be, there's nothing more I can say. - I don't believe this. - You don't believe voodoo exists? - No, I don't believe I'm gonna miss my wedding rehearsal. (distant frantic drumming) (frantic drumming) (screaming) - Amazing, isn't it? Practicing our corrupted form with their faith in the biggest city in the country, and nobody seems to know about it but us. (frantic drumming) (screaming) - Mother? Mother? (speaking in foreign language) - Si, I'm here. (frantic drumming) (screaming) - I'm not so sure this is the best place for us to lie low, Mr. Warren. - [Waldo] You could be right. Call me Waldo. (frantic drumming) (screaming) (singing in foreign language) Now, now, wait. - She'll be burned! - I don't think so. (frantic dreaming) (singing in foreign language) (foreboding music) - Some of these people look awfully familiar. - I wondered how long it would take you to figure it out. (frantic drumming) (singing in foreign language) (foreboding music) - Mother! - Baby! Oh, my baby. I knew you'd come back to me. - No one has to know about this, Miss Davalos. Your mother's secret will remain with us. - Now you must really think we're animals, don't you? - What? - You'll never understand, none of you. - What? - Please, I want to go to my mother. (foreboding music) (frantic drumming) (screaming) - What are you waiting for? (tense music) (gun firing) (screaming) (gun firing) (screaming and groaning) - I told you you would thank me for that some day. - What the hell was that all about? - Some other time, Barney. Right now, we have to figure out what Ciprian Lane and Esteve are going to pull next. - Esteve? - I knew he was behind all this. - Well, what did he have to gain? He was really running the government. He wasn't part of the rebels. - No, he wasn't, was he, Anjanette? - Anjanette, you? - It's not what you think, Madam Davalos. Your daughter and her people had no part in the attack on the embassy. - Then who did? - Esteve. He hired Lane to make it look like it was Anjanette's followers. - But why? - Because he had a plan, didn't he, Madam Davalos? - He... He promised me things wouldn't go this far. - Mother! - (speaks in foreign language) Please! Your father wasn't supposed to die. It was only supposed to look like he was wounded, that's all, so that we could proclaim martial law. - Why? - So that they had a month to loot the treasury of the country, before the real revolution took place. - Your father is not dead, girl. - What? - What I say is true. - I knew it, I told you it was a fake! - Where is he? - I think I know. (tense music) (energetic music) - Get her! (screaming) (gun fires) (hissing) - I just bought these, Llewellyn. You'll get the bill. - I don't believe this. - Wake up, Presidente! Wake up! This time, no drugs. This time, it's for real. (ominous music) Goodbye, Presidente. (ominous music) - [Anjanette] Father! Father! (bubbling) - No! (tense music) - He's dead. - Who ever thought you could watch the same man die twice in one lifetime? - I hate to say this. - What? - I have to take a leak. - Actually, that's probably not a bad idea. This is gonna be a long night. (pulling zipper) - Now what? - We track Esteve. - How, we don't know where the hell he went. - I've got a pretty good idea. - Yeah? (gun clicks) (suspenseful music) - Now's not the time to find out, Barney. (gun firing) - You what? - Barney, there are some things about this business you don't wanna know. - So, where do we go from here? - Where else? (pulls zipper) (frantic drumming) - They tried to stop us, but they can't. We move with the speed of the (speaks in foreign language). Never dies! The old ways never die! - [Voiceover] Colonel Esteve, kill him! (frantic drumming) (tense music) (whooshing) (smacking) (groaning) (frantic drumming) - They tried to find us, but they can't! - [Followers] No! - They tried to stop us, but they can't! - [Followers] No! - Those who do not believe can only die! (ominous music) (frantic drumming) (screaming) (clattering) (screaming) (frantic drumming) (screaming) - Get the feeling this wasn't the ideal time to show up. (screaming) - Oh, she'll skin him alive! - Mother! - It's true, she kept all the old ways! She lied to me! Oh, Mama, you promised me! - Old ways never change. You knew that from the beginning! You knew we would never change! - You promised. - For what? So that you could marry a man and then lie to him about where you came from? - Mama, no, Mama! - Your daughter, the girl I never saw before tonight, you were ashamed! - I wanted the best for us, Mama. - There is nothing better than the way of the Dimbala! Get that? Pay the price! (groaning) (screaming) (tense music) (fire crackling) Dimbala never dies! Never! The old ways never, never change. We will kill them all! (tense music) (fire roaring) (fire crackling) (fire roaring) (mystical music) - Don't worry, they won't hurt you. It's over. - I don't get it. (mystical music) (fire crackling) What's happening? - They're going home. - Why? How come they aren't tearing me to pieces? - Mama Dora was the last in the line of voodoo priestesses. Marianna refused to follow her lead. They knew the end was coming. (mystical music) (fire crackling) Death is the easiest thing for them to understand. It's almost all they know. I think they were waiting for it. - How? - Barney, it's over. They've accepted it, why don't you? (mystical music) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (clanging) - You can't escape me now. You know it! It could have been so easy, Anjanette. All you had to do is go along with everything, (gun cocks) like your mother and father did. You could have been rich, rich! You know what I have here? More than you could ever dream of! Much more! Don't you want to know? $17,000,000, 17,000,000, Anjanette! And there could have been more, much more, if you'd only given us the time! We had a cargo plane waiting on the (mumbling) in San Caribe, filled with every treasure imaginable: paintings, Rolls Royces, antiques worth a fortune, could have been ours, all of it, if only you'd given me the time to present your mother to the press tomorrow. And now, the plane is still standing on the runway, and you have nothing. Nothing! No one gives a damn about the 50 disgusting people on your island! They're stupid, ignorant, undeserving of help! There was never anything you could have done for them, you must realize that by now! So come on out! Come out, Anjanette! Show me the man, and we'll kill him. All of this can be yours too. We'll rule San Caribe together. You're the last one left. It's all yours, yours and mine. (gun fires) (energetic music) - I hate using my left hand. Never really know if it's gonna work. - And so, after a series of almost unbelievable events, Anjanette Davalos finds herself in charge of a new government. It's a job that promises to be one of the most challenging and difficult roles on the international scene today. Only time will tell if this unseasoned, but highly regarded, young woman will be able to bring peace, and perhaps even prosperity, to the troubled Caribbean island that is her home. (all yelling simultaneously) - What about the funds? What about the voodoo? - One at a time, please. Miss Davalos is ready to answer any and all questions you might have. (all yelling simultaneously) Please, one at a time. (all yelling simultaneously) Let's start with you. - Miss Davalos, what about the funds? (all yelling simultaneously) - Please. (all yelling simultaneously) Please! (all yelling simultaneously) Please! (all yelling simultaneously) - The state department called, they want Waldo exclusively. Something about the satisfaction of working for your own country. Here's a message from Central America, a dictatorship. They'll give you your own island, all the women you want, horses, cars, boats, houses, anything. The United Arab Emirates are offering the most pleasant climate in the Gulf, and money is no object. - Loyalty, Waldo, remember your friends. After all, we created you. - Oh, and Barney, your fiancee called. - Oh. - The wedding is off. - Well, I suppose that's all right. I didn't really wanna get married anyway. - No? - No, I have a good thing going here. I mean, now that I figured out what it's all about. I mean, a little adventure, little excitement, good money, I'm gonna be a gunman. You think I can make it? (cocks hang gun) (hand gun fires) (energetic music)
