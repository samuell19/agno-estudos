[man narrating] You know the fairy tale about the princess waiting for some brave prince to come and save her? Yeah, this is not that kind of a story. Meet Samantha. She's the second-born daughter of the royal family of Illyria, the smallest country in Europe. See? That one right there. Sam, here, has never been a typical princess. Unlike her older sister, Eleanor, who always seemed perfectly regal in every way, Sam wasn't. [Eleanor screams] [man] Things got even tougher when, at age five, she found out her father, the king, had died in a plane crash with his brother. After that, Sam's mom took over the throne and the job of running the country. [chattering] [man] But in a few weeks, Eleanor, the rightful heir, will turn 18, and she'll become the Queen of Illyria. [shutters clicking] [applause] [man] As for Sam, she's just never fit into this royal world. She's like so many second-borns just searching for her place. You see, Sam's destined for great things. She just doesn't know it yet. That's where I come in. But... we'll get there soon enough. [Sam] We're almost there. Good, 'cause this gear is not light. [Sam] Tell me about it. Hey, are you sure you wanna do this? -Last chance to turn back. -[Sam] Of course I'm sure. [chuckles] You sound like my mom. [boy] Come on. Do you know how many people would kill to be royalty? I would. You so do not mean that. You can do whatever you want with your life. You can just be yourself. My entire future is planned out for me. Second-borns are supposed to host cocktail parties and cut ribbons and smile silently in the background. It's not me. I wanna do something that matters. Makes sense to me. [speaker feedback] -Hello, Illyria. -[crowd cheering] We are here because we want change. Down with the monarchy. Give us freedom. We demand a voice. A choice. If you agree with us, make some noise. Hit it!

We gotta go. You get the gear. I'll distract the cops. [policeman] Hey, hey, hey! Get back here! [blaring continues] [grunts, groans] [gasps] [sighs] [bell tolling] [policewoman on radio] 88-14 clear. -Leave us. -Your Majesty. Hey, Mom. Again, Samantha? [Sam] You're in here planning Eleanor's coronation, but out there people are unhappy. No, some people, about 30 of them. It's a flash mob, not a majority. -The rest are content. -Really? Hate it or not, you are a princess, and if you could just stop rebelling against that, you might realize that it's actually a pretty cool opportunity. Whatever. I gotta go to school. Don't forget to wash your face. I'm 15. I don't need to be told-- Thanks. [school bell rings] [male announcer on PA] Good morning, young royals. Summer break is almost here, but not quite yet. Get to class. [locker beeps] So, Gwenyth124 asked me why I was spending my summer vacation in Haiti. And it's because I saw this video of these adorable, unfortunate orphans. They were caught in a mudslide, and I just knew that I had to do something, you know? I got to go. Love. Bye. [cell phone chimes] It wasn't a mudslide. It was a 7.0 earthquake followed by a Category 4 hurricane. Yes, a hurricane that caused a mudslide. And, besides, I don't think it really matters why the Haitians are suffering. The point is that I'm there to do something about it. -Which is what exactly? -Oh, I'm building an orphanage. Will you be carrying bricks, pouring concrete? I'm a princess. I'm bringing awareness. To Haiti, or to yourself? Listen, this is more than you've ever done for anyone. You just walk around hating on the monarchy and embarrassing your family. Your sister must be so ashamed to be related to you. That's why I have 106 million friends, and you have none. [guard 1] Level four is the worst of the worst. The most notorious criminals in the world. Inmates ordinary prisons aren't equipped to handle. -What's on level five? -We call him Inmate 34. [guard 2] All this for one guy? Who is he? Don't know. I'm not sure I want to. [controls beep] [device beeps, buzzing] [rock music playing] [boy] That was good. Still think we can do better. [Sam] Well, now that it's summer, we've got way more time to practice. No more school. No more Roxana, Princess von Selfie. Oh, it's so cool she's going to Haiti. Unfollow. [sighs] [Sam] Thank you. Look, the point is, we have our first paid gig coming up, and for us to be ready, we need to focus. Oh, I am focused. It is going to be the highlight of my summer. Not necessarily. To celebrate your release from Strathmore School for the Incredibly Entitled and mine from Illyria Public, I got us tickets to... [tambourine jingling] -Bramblebone! Tonight. [chuckles] -I'm not worthy. -Your dad's gonna let you go? -Well, he's working all night. Luckily, coronations keep a groundskeeper very busy. I will see you there. Oh, and you might want to brush your teeth. I can smell the garlic naan you had for lunch. That was... two days ago. Uh... [exhales, sniffs] Did you know that every snowflake is unique... each with its imperfections and flaws? That's what makes them so special. You're my snowflake, Sam. [Catherine] Samantha! Why aren't you ready? We're gonna be late. Late for what? [applause] [Eleanor] Thank you, Illyrian foreign press. Thank you so much for coming. Hey. You look wonderful. Thank you for coming. [Catherine] I apologize for being late. [Eleanor] It's not your fault. You know, the Queen does have the authority to imprison someone for tardiness. Well, you're not the queen yet. Four weeks. I can hardly wait. And if being in a dungeon means I don't have to wear this dress, then-- A photo of Your Majesties? -Thank you. -[cell phone chimes] I gotta go. I have a huge headache and a massive history final tomorrow. Your Highness, Duke Heresford. Straight home. Study and sleep. Thank you. Have a good prom. -Boo! -Finally. I thought you ghosted me. It's Bramblebone. Nothing in the world could stop me. IDs? [Mike sighs] I can't believe this. Must be a new rule. How was I supposed to know that they card now? [sighs] [keypad beeping] -[door unlocks] -Come on. I have an idea. -[keypad beeping] -[door unlocks] Wha-- How did you do that? I saw the guy enter the code. Right. Yeah, that totally makes sense. You could see those tiny numbers from super far away. Which brings me back to, how did you do that? I don't know. It's weird. Let's go. They're playing a new song. [playing "Kickin' In"] -[Mike] It's so good! -[Sam] I love this song! What's wrong? [Sam] I'm fine. -[insect buzzing] -[wings beating] [glass clinking] [fingers tapping] [distorted noise] Are you okay? I need to make it stop. -[alarm blaring] -[chattering] [sighs] What was that? We've been Bramble-banned for life. I don't know. It was like I was hearing every single sound in the club all at once. Even the wings on a fly. It sounds crazy. Well, not coming from the girl who can make out the numbers on a keypad from across the street and smell what I had for lunch two days ago. Maybe I have a brain tumor. You don't have a brain tumor, Sam. You know what I thought when I first saw you ten years ago? Why is she hot-wiring my dad's tractor? [chuckles] That you were gonna be my best friend. Although, the hot-wiring thing was-- It's pretty sick. [chuckles] I'm here for you, Sam. Everything's gonna be okay. You're gonna be fine. -This sucks. -[Sam] I'm sorry. -[alarm blares] -[door unlocks] Hey... Dad! You missed your history final. Professor Blake will let me make it up. No one will know anything about what happened last night, especially not my... mom. [sighs] [Sam] You knew? And you let me spend the night in jail? [Catherine] Actions have consequences. It's a miracle the only casualty was the band's sound system, which is coming out of your allowance. -[Sam] Of course. -I spoke to Professor Blake. He'll let you make up the final by attending summer school. -No way! -Very much "way." You'll live on campus. No distractions. Am I clear? Good. Go pack. -School starts... -Tomorrow? [Sam on phone] I know. [Mike on phone] Guess I can't complain about being grounded for the weekend. So much for our first gig. I will find a way to escape. -[knocks] -Oh. I gotta go. The person of the year just walked into my room. [Mike] Okay, bye. -I came to say goodbye. -You mean good riddance? The next time we see each other-- You'll be Queen. Like you've always wanted. I wish you could be happy for me. [Sam] I want to. But I don't understand how any of this can make you happy. Always being on display. Being told exactly how to be. We're royals. That's our job. I know it makes sense to you. It just never has for me. Maybe someday it will. [cell phone rings, beeps] [Inmate 34] Hello? I'm free. The apple was a very clever idea. Stick to the plan. Phase one begins tomorrow. [cell phone beeps] [man on PA] Summer school students, please report to room 203. Hi, there. Uh, hi, there. Heard you the first time. Oh, I wasn't sure. I'm January. I'm Palace School back in Luxembourg. Just here for the extra credit. You must be Sam. Our royal families go way back. My dad was friends with your uncle. I heard Strathmore is the best. It sucks. You'll love it. Uh, thanks, I guess. -So... -Look, June-- -January. -[Sam] Whatever. You seem like a perfectly typical princess who's genuinely excited to be here. I just figured since we were the only two people in the class... [clears throat] Oh, hi. I didn't notice you. -I'm January, this is-- -Sam. I'm Matteo. Nice to meet you-- [boy 2] What's up, breakfast club? So, this is Strathmore? My fourth school in three months. Bad news, you're stuck here. Good news, you're stuck here with me. How exactly is that "good news"? 'Cause I bring the party, Joan of Dark. Drop dead, Fresh Prince. [chuckling] It's all right. She'll come around. I tend to grow on people. -Like fungus? -Yeah. [Roxana sighs] It's so good to see you guys. All 108 million of you. Thank you, Evil Kitten, and no, I'm not looking forward to summer school either. But I am a survivor. Just like Beyoncé. [chuckles] Right, gotta run. Loves. I can't believe this is happening. Fourteen days of unexcused absence. I mean, I Skyped in every day from Coachella. [sighs] I didn't know you could be sent to summer school for having no fashion sense. -Go mute yourself. -Ouch. [January] Hi, Roxana. I'm a really big fan. I'm January, and I can't wait to get to know all of you better. Well, I'll give you the CliffsNotes. She's the most annoying person in school, and Prince Tuma over here, is a total jerk. He dated my BFF, and all he cares about is himself. And all you care about is what filter you use. I've always been no filter, and everyone knows that. Where's the rest of the class? There can't only be four of us. -Five. -[man] Good morning, class. My name's Mr. Morrow, but you can call me James. [James narrating] Yup, this is me. Your loyal royal narrator. [chuckles] I bet you were wondering when I'd show up. Little bit about me. I have a boyfriend named Henry, an iguana named Jeff, and a severe gluten allergy. Seriously, give me a bagel and I'm as good as dead. We are going to have fun this summer. Oh, God. We got the "cool teacher." Thank you. No one's ever called me cool before. This ain't my first rodeo. You guys are in good hands. He definitely wasn't the cool teacher. [chuckles] Quick question for you. Why do you think you're here? Oh, well, I threw a party. That doesn't sound bad. In the chem lab, burned down half the school. -It wasn't my fault. -[James] Incorrect. Prince Matteo, same question. [Matteo] Um... My parents got a letter from school. My social skills are a bit lacking. The principal thought a smaller class might help. Also, incorrect. Princess Samantha. It's Sam, and I'm pretty sure anything I say is gonna be wrong. Now, that is correct. The reasons all of you were sent to "summer school" were cover-up stories to get you all here without arousing suspicion. Oh! [chuckles] I get it. I'm on a reality TV show. Are you the host? Oh, no. Gosh. That's the dream, though. But, alas, I'm a prince. A second-born royal, just like you guys. Our siblings are the heirs, we the spares. Powerless. Without purpose... or so everyone thinks. [chuckling] Dude, you're a hologram. They had one of Celine Dion performing at my cousin's knighting ceremony. Maybe it's a twin brother? [James] Okay, here's the deal. There's a special gene exclusive to second-borns of royal bloodlines. A gene that gives some of us extraordinary abilities that manifest at your age. You guys have superpowers. Your abilities are unique to you alone. That is why you're here, to harness your untapped potential, which you will use as members of the Secret Society of Second-Born Royals. It's a mouthful, we know. So... [sighs] we're superheroes? [James] That's correct. There is one catch, though. Nobody, even your family, can know we exist. I've had that superpower for years. Dude, so sad. Now, to protect our secrecy, I'm going to have to take all of your phones. I'm so sorry to confiscate your phones for the immediate and not so temporary future. When you say, "the immediate and not so temporary future," you don't mean, like, the whole summer, right? The pain you're experiencing right now will only make you stronger. So, James, are you the head of the Society? [James] Not exactly. I am. Mom? Welcome to the Secret Society training program. For thousands of years, second-borns like you and myself have protected our kingdoms from threats, assassins and international criminals. We work in secret. Our rewards? Lives saved. Order restored. The next six weeks will be challenging. You may doubt you have what it takes, but whatever obstacles you face, nothing is impossible. Those of you who make the cut will join the Society. Those who don't will return to your kingdoms. You'll be stripped of your powers, and your memories will be modified to erase any recollection of this training. I wish you the best of luck. [Sam] You lied to me. I withheld the truth. There's a difference. Did Dad know? Does El? No, and she'll never know. That's how we protect those we love. How? You long to be more than a princess, this meaningless title you were born with. This is your chance. Go join the others and make me proud. [sighs] -[James] What did you tell her? -[Catherine] What she needed to hear. Any news on the prison break? He had help. Every Society operative around the world is out searching. We'll find him. [banging] [cell phone ringing] [cell phone beeps] Do you have something for me? [distorted voice on phone] Not yet, but I'm working on it. Meanwhile, keep strengthening your telekinesis. It's been a long time. I rotted in that cell Catherine put me in for ten years... waiting to escape while the world forgot I existed. Now I'm going to take everything from her. Ten years. [grunts] [James] Welcome, trainees. Now you're probably all wondering, "What are my powers?" I'm wondering that myself, but we will get to that. First, however, a little Secret Society tradition for new trainees. You're gonna like it. Actually, you might not like it. What's up? Does that involve push-ups? I have a doctor's note for that. [chuckling] All right. Yeah, you're definitely not gonna like it. [tablet beeps] [January] No way. This is amazing! Super basic. All you gotta do is get from here to there. First person who gets the pyramid wins the prize. That's it? [chuckles] Piece of cake. [groaning] Lesson one, expect the unexpected. Well, what are you waiting for, a royal invitation? Let's go. FYI, the lasers hurt. [grunts] Whoop. -[January] I'm going to beat you. -[Roxana] You wish. [James] Ah, you kids are really athletic. [grunts] [grunts] [screams, grunts] [screams, grunts] [groans] Ow, I chipped a nail. Guys, I just lost my thumb. I text with my thumb. Oh, my God. I'm melting. -That's your power. Invisibility. -A-plus. Can I have my legs back now? They're my second most-commented-on feature. You just lost your bottom. Right, that's it. I'm out. [gasps, grunts] Hey, forget her. Help me up. Coming. So demanding. Figure out this course and take me to the pyramid. [Sam] Why do I suddenly care so much about helping you? Because I'm charming. Not to anyone with a pulse. Maybe that's his power? He tells people what to do, and they listen. Fine. Tell me your most embarrassing secret. I've never kissed anyone. You see, I'd never admit that. He can make people do whatever he says. Greatest power ever. Duck! [grunts, groaning] Lesson two, be aware of your surroundings. It would be really useful if you gave us the lessons beforehand. Well, that would kinda defeat the whole purpose, wouldn't it? A word of warning, the lasers are still shooting. [January] How did you know? I heard it. I have super senses. [insect buzzing] Whoa! -How did you do that? -The laser bounced off the padding. -[grunts] -[January gasps] Ow. [gasps, screams] [grunts] [grunts] [panting] [Roxana] Can I have my cell phone back, please? -Well, that was a great success. -[tablet beeps] [Roxana] Does anyone want to trade powers? Super senses for kind of invisibility? I'm good. What about you, Matteo? You're kind of invisible anyway. Sure. You can have my power of being awkward 'cause that's all I have right now. [insect buzzing] So many bugs. Maybe we're late bloomers. We just have to be patient. -Just like that story about the tortoise-- -Stop talking. Well, that was rude. I just wanted to see if it'll work. And January was annoying me. [chuckles] Can you order yourself to be less obnoxious? Hey, that was a joke. Come on. You don't have much to freak out about, anyway. Your mom's the boss. You're in no matter what. You seriously overestimate my relationship with my mother. Oh, my God. Guys, you can see me, right? Everything except your face. What's wrong with my face? Where'd January go? Dunno. But I can see your face again. [chuckles] Hmm? It doesn't make sense. James said our powers are unique, and we already have an invisible girl. Not anymore. -[slaps] -Ow! Ugh, really? -You slapped me. -You deserved it. Ooh, I can talk again. -Slap yourself. -No, you slap yourself. -Ow! -Why did you do that? She told me to do it. I'm so confused. When January touched Roxana, she became invisible, and when she touched Tuma, he did exactly what she told him to. So, whoever I touch last... You take away their power, and it becomes yours. Great. Now I'm the only person without a power. Typical. Hey, you're going to find your power too, and it's gonna be awesome. [insect buzzing] Really think so? Yeah. Totally. I hope it's X-ray vision... or flying. Well, flying is involved. Hey, dude, your power's being a bug magnet. You're Bug Man. [chuckles] There are, like, 100 rooms in here. Why do we all have to share the same one? I guess they want us to bond? Oh, great. Let me know how that goes, yeah? Later. Oh, not too bad. Hey, we can work with this. I guess we should choose our beds, right? -Hey, give me that bed. -Okay. I love this power. Whoo. [chuckles] Did you have any idea you were different? Before today, I mean. [stammers] Yeah. About a year ago people started doing the craziest things when I asked. I always thought it was because I was super charming but now it all makes sense. How about you? I don't know. The last few months, I've been getting a lot of bug bites. I didn't think much of it, and no one else noticed, of course. One of the benefits of being invisible. Hey, you're not invisible to invisible girl. I saw that butterfly she gave you. She'd never go for a guy like me. Never say never. Hey, you can have this bed if you want to. I shouldn't have just-- It's okay. This one's fine. But maybe next time don't do that powers thing on me. Fair enough. As long as you keep your bugs to yourself. Deal. Mind if I take the top? My twin brother always took the top bunk when we were kids. He's the worst. He cheated on all of his finals. I'm genuinely worried about our country if he's the one who's ruling it. He was born first by a minute, so he gets the throne. So unfair. I hear you. Is your sister horrible too? Actually, no. She's perfect in every way. Being a second-born is bad enough, but when you always feel like you're second place... It's not just that. It's constantly feeling like I'm being compared to her or compared to how a princess should be. Like, we can't have our own identities. Exactly. [cell phone vibrating] [January] Backup phone. Smart. Don't worry, I can keep a secret. [James] Learning to use your powers is all about focus, concentration, precision. Right now, your powers are being controlled by hormones, stressful situations, peer pressure, social anxiety, physical attraction, even loud music from an overrated band. Now that you know what your powers are, training is about learning to control them. How do we do that? Practice. This test is designed to help sharpen your super senses. Listen carefully to the voices. -Okay, pay attention. -[voices from speakers] A little boy just told Santa what he wants for Christmas. What is it? [young man] Remember the last time we were here? -[young woman] Of course. -Not socks? [doctor] The results are in. Are you ready to find out? [student] I just don't have a good feeling-- The boy is asking for... [student 2] It's not a big deal. [student] I'm not going to cheat. Because he has the same answers to the final every year. I don't know. "To learn to succeed, you must first learn to fail." [voices continue] Prince Tuma, you have one of the more unique powers I've ever seen. -Thanks. -I understand you're quite the dog lover. Big time! I've got five purebreds back at the palace and they love me. Glad you said that. Because your powers rely on your interactions with others, you'll need a partner. Bring it. And seeing as no royal has ever been able to train Charlie, we thought your unique skill set could meet the challenge. Charlie? Prince Tuma, meet Charlie. [dog barking] If you can get him to obey your orders, you can get anyone to follow your command. What, what do I have to practice? Isn't my power borrowing someone else's? Yes, but you need to learn how to do it for more than a few seconds. We're gonna work on getting you to keep them for as long as necessary. In a pool? I wanna introduce you to someone. She is gonna help you with your training. Pleasure to meet you. I'm Princess Anna of Spain. My power is breathing underwater. And now it's yours. -Good luck. -[January screams] [coughs] Ready? -[insects buzzing] -Come on. Lift it. [James] Insects aren't just drawn to you, Matteo. You can also control them. -[buzzing continues] -[Matteo grunts] [grunts] -[groans] -[sighs] I love that you get me, James. Honestly, I've been so missing my Karma cycle class, but, you know, I wasn't about to complain. Oh, what's that? [James on intercom] Solar flare simulation. Agents must be prepared to deploy year-round, bearing the coldest of winters to the hottest of summers. That artificial sun is scrumpt-- Do you reckon I can still tan whilst I'm invisible? [beeps] Oi. That's a bit cold. [chuckles] Ah, goggles. Wise choice. [beeps] Oh. Oh. All right, James. I get it. We're ready year-round. All seasons. Please push stop. You disappear, I turn it off. Gosh, that's so annoying. Why can't I disappear? [grunts] [huffs] [voices from speakers] [young man] Remember the last time we were here? [Roxana sighs] I'm so over this. Hey! You've got the power of persuasion. Surely you can compel James to return my phone. Your fans won't care if you don't post for 48 hours. I've an image to maintain. A responsibility. What about serving your kingdom? Firsties are the ones with all the responsibility. Whole point of being us is hakuna matata. Hey, you're not the one who has to spend their summer running away from man's best friend. Okay, kids, lunch is up. Sam. [sniffs] This smells toxic. Relax. Only Sam's was poisoned. She needs the practice. Everything is a test. Everything. [Tuma] Dang. That's cold. [sighs] Here. We can share. Red apples are my favorite. Thanks. I just realized something. I've never had lunch with other kids at Strathmore before. [barking dog approaching] All right, I'm out. Time to train. -Hey, come on, Charlie. -[Charlie barks] -[Matteo] Oh! -[Tuma] Come on, boy. [Roxana chuckles] [insect buzzing] [buzzing stops] I'm gonna get malaria and die. -No, you're not. -You might. Yeah, actually, you might. [phone vibrating] -Hey. -Hey. Sorry I've been MIA. How's it going? What class are you taking? You know, the ushe. How's your summer going? Well, not as much fun without you, but it's gonna be awesome. I printed out the fliers for our gig. -[shutter clicks] -[phone chimes] Can't wait. I gotta go. Yeah, okay. Uh... Good night. Good night. Hey, those look great. Thanks. You know, I've been working for royals my entire life. They live in their own world. I'm just worried that someday she's gonna forget about you and move on. I don't want to see you get hurt. Sam's not like that, Dad. She's my best friend. Hey, James. You wanted to see me? Mom? [breathes heavily] Teleportation? -That's your power? -Mm-hmm. Next time call me a Lyft. James said you're struggling. Epsilon 97 red Q zero. [beeps] I'm guessing that's not your Wi-Fi password. Royal master code. Opens every door in the palace. Overrides any security measure. As the queen and the head of the Society, I'm the only person who has it. I'm sharing it because I trust you. Might wanna hold on to that chair. [Sam screams] [exclaiming, panting] [breathes heavily] [beeps] We have a Batcave under our house? Our headquarters. No recruit is supposed to see it until training is complete. Wow. So you're breaking the rules. I won't tell if you won't. What is all this stuff? Disrupter prototype. Stolen from a research facility in Kyoto. Recovered by us. Ultrasonic elephant whistle taken from a poaching ring in Chad. DNA-based nano-device programmed to target specific genetic sequences. It can isolate and contain cellular materials. Our most decorated operatives. Lots of people struggle in the beginning. What's with the empty frame? A former member who betrayed us. We keep it empty as a reminder our powers were given to us to defend the world, not rule it. You don't have to worry about that. I can't even figure out what some kid wants for Christmas. The key to mastering your power is mastering yourself. [chuckles] It's not helpful. I know how hard training is, but this is worth it. I don't know what this is. I mean, a couple weeks ago I thought you were banishing me to summer school, and then I find out that you're head of the Avengers. I have these powers that I don't know how to use, and I'm supposed to defend the world? I went through the same feelings when I was your age. I'm a second-born too. What did you do? I let go of the pressure I was putting on myself and allowed myself to just be in the moment. All I hear is noise. Try this. You are at one of those royal events you love, people, music, chitchat. What do you do? I tune them out. Mm-hmm. Now, find the sound you want to hear. You're stronger than you know, Sam. [Santa] There's many things that are different than a toy... [doctor] We have the results. Are you ready to find out? -...same answers to the final every year. -[student] I don't think it's a good idea. -...Santa could bring you for Christmas. -[student 2] Fine. Your loss. [young boy] I just want my mom to get better. [static, indistinct voices] The boy's mom is sick. He's asking Santa if she's going to get better. -Mm-hmm. Keep going. -[young man] Will you marry me? A guy is proposing to his girlfriend in the spot where they first met. [student 2] It's not a big deal. A girl has the answers to a bio test, but her friend doesn't want to cheat. -[James] Mm-hmm. -[doctor] It's a boy. And a girl. A doctor is telling a pregnant woman that she's having... [doctor] Congratulations, you're having twins. ...twins. [James] Excellent work. See? Being second-born doesn't mean you're second-best. -[Sam] Just one question. -Mm-hmm? Does the boy's mom get better? Yeah, she did. And yours would be very proud. Are we gonna go again? Okay, whatever you say. Please tell me you can't see anything! All I see is a princess who needs to work harder. James, I want nothing more than to get off this... stupid thing! But I just can't do it. [Roxana screams] Come on. Lift it. [insects buzzing] Yes. -[beeps] -How'd I do this time? You were under for ten minutes. [Anna] That's the longest you've held on to my powers yet. Yes. Brava. Quite the improvement. Hey, Charlie! No class for you today, Prince Tuma. Really? Sweet. -Yeah. Charlie's sick. -Oh. He ate something that didn't agree with him. Hey, buddy. Charlie. I didn't know that treat would make you sick. I was just trying to be nice. I didn't know what else to do. Everyone always just listens to what I tell them. [Charlie barks] Okay. Look, look, look. -This is my fault. -[cries] Clearly, physical duress doesn't trigger your powers. I got something really special for you, Roxy. Okay? -Oh, my phone. -Yeah. [chuckles] What are you doing? I know you missed your followers over the past few weeks. I'm sure that they would love to say hi, right? You're bluffing. I mean, you don't even know my password. With the click of a button, I can create the most sophisticated interactive obstacle course in the world. I think I got this. No. They can't see me like this. James, why are you being so mean? -And we are live in four, three, two, one! -I mean. I mean, look at me. No. No. No! No! -[Roxana breathes heavily] -Well done. Same time tomorrow. [Roxana] Can you please log off? Oh, I was never online. Reception's terrible down here. [chuckles] Everything okay? I turned myself invisible today. That's great. But it's not. I'm able to do all these really cool things, but no one will see me. So, what does it matter? I forgot, livestream or it's not real. Performance is part of being a royal. I've lived my whole life online. [sighs] It's always been me. Why can't you be you without all that? Because I genuinely don't know where to start. Well, I can't help you with that. Thanks a lot. [chuckles] Only because you have to figure that out for yourself. Yeah. [sniffs] -Yeah. -[chuckles] How do I look? Awful. [both chuckle] It's a new record. [indistinct overlapping voices] -[Matteo] Come on. -[insects buzzing] -[Matteo] Yes! -[Tuma] Awesome! -Bro! -[chuckles] That was awesome. -Thank you. -Charlie! You're all better! [Sam] Aw. Aw, that's my boy, Charlie. [chuckles] [chuckling] [exhales] Hey, Sam. I'm here. Got the gear. Super pumped. [sighs] Hey, come see our show. [cell phone vibrates] [imitates snoring] [snoring playing through phone] -[alarm blaring] -[James on intercom] Attention, trainees. Suit up and meet in the loading dock immediately. Attention, trainees. Suit up and meet in the loading dock immediately! [blaring continues] Let's go! Get in. Get in. Get in. Get in. Let's go! There's been a break-in at the royal treasury. If the thieves steal the crown jewels, they could be sold on the black market for billions to buy weapons of mass destruction. -So super low stakes. -Our first mission. We got this. Hey, come to our show. We're on soon. Thanks. Come on, Sam. Where are you? Hey, come to our show. We're on soon. [James] Your mission is to protect the jewels at all costs. [gasps, chuckles] [Sam] Wow! Look at that! -Those are some big rocks. -Yeppers. [Sam] You guys stay here and guard the jewels. I saw one of the thieves. I'm going after him. She's gonna need backup. They aren't getting all the glory. I guess it's just you and me. Or it's just you. Hey, guys. Wait up. [Sam] I saw him. He was wearing a hood. [January] He's got to be in there. Now what? Maybe we should just wait for James. No way. If we take this guy down, James is gonna be super impressed. [January] It's so dark. I can't see anything. [insect buzzing] -[January] Hey, look. -[Matteo] Come on. Come on. Come on. [Matteo] Watch out! Oh. I crushed that. [chuckles] You did it. Yeah, I did. Thanks. That was really smart. Uh, guys. That's my swim coach. Wait, why would your swim coach wanna steal the jewels? The jewels! Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. -This is bad. -Oh, you think? In a matter of minutes, you managed to disobey my orders, lose a priceless national treasure, and put yourself in a potentially deadly situation with no plan. Your degree of failure is remarkable. Thank you for your help, Princess Anna. Of course. Anytime. Wait, I'm confused. Where are the jewels? Oh, where they've always been, in the real treasury. Congratulations, you've all failed the test. I'm canceling tomorrow's training. Take the day to consider the consequences had this been real. Class dismissed. [cell phone vibrating] [beeps] Where were you? I'm sorry. I couldn't make it. Yeah, I know. I was there. What happened? I just couldn't. -Sam, what's going on? Talk to me. -I really wanna tell you... [door opens] But I can't. I gotta go. You okay? I don't wanna talk about it. [Tuma] None of us are getting in. Catherine said, "No matter what obstacles you face, nothing is impossible." She also said not everyone's gonna make the cut. Definitely one of those people. Hey, you deserve to be here as much as anyone else. I've been going to Strathmore for three years. You didn't even know I existed until this summer. But that wasn't your fault. That was mine. And we know you now. Until we all get our minds wiped. What if that really happens? We'll forget we even have powers. We'll forget the whole summer. Do we really want that? No way. Hanging with you guys has been the best thing that's ever happened to me. Well, if they're gonna make us forget, we can at least make this a day to remember. I have an idea. Come on. Told you I'd bring the party. Is this one as fun as the one you threw at your old school? Well, there are no explosions yet, so... [chuckles] How'd that happen anyway? My friends and I were messing around in the lab. Told them to mix a bunch of chemicals, as a joke. You know, see if we could start a fire. Didn't know I was using my power on them. Can't really use that excuse anymore. If I told someone to do something and something bad happened, it was on them. But now I realize it's on me. Took you a while, but you got there. Now I'm starting to grow on you. Maybe a little. Like a fungus. [chuckles] Yeah, like a fungus. [Roxana] We got the Popsicles. [chuckles] [Sam] Thanks. I want a pink one. Are they poisoned? [chuckles] They're all the same. If you go down, we all do. We should do this again. Maybe, like, Saturday? Can't. Sister's stupid coronation. You guys have fun. Yeah, must suck going to the hottest event of the season. With the prettiest dresses. It's definitely not the hottest event of the season. Just instead of only Illyria obsessing over my sister for an hour, the whole world gets to. I can always make Sam invite us. But mind control would be a messed up thing to do to a friend. I mean, if you guys really wanna go, I could use the company. -Really? -Yeah. Oh, my God. [screams] [chuckles] Okay. Never do that again. Oh, my God! You guys go ahead. We'll catch up. That was the best day ever. Totally, so why are you sad? It just hit me. I'm leaving soon, which means I'm not going to be here. After training, it's back to my kingdom and my stupid brother. [Sam chuckles] [January] We never even got a chance to hang out at your palace. How about now? Come on. Can't believe you talked me into missing curfew. We could get into so much trouble. I like it. They tightened security for the upcoming coronation. We can't go through the front gate without my mom finding out. Come on. Epsilon 97 red Q zero. [January] Wow! My dad converted the tower into a studio. He and my uncle Edmond would come up here and jam all the time. He always said, "Snowflake, it's good to rule, but it's more fun to rock." [playing Mozart's "Eine kleine Nachtmusik"] [January chuckles] It was either piano or ballet. Had a lot of free time while everyone doted on my precious brother. [playing rock music] -[January chuckles] -Sam? [Sam] Mike, wait! No. Mike, wait! Wait! I'm sorry about the gig. Yeah, and now you're in a band with somebody else? No, she's just a girl from school. -Oh, right. You mean another princess. -It's not like that. I can explain. Go ahead. I-- Yeah, that's what I thought. Later, Your Highness. Everything okay? We should get back. My mom really wanted me to do the whole ballet thing, but I'm happy I picked piano. It's so much fun to just jam, and, anyway, tulle makes me itch. [Sam] Mm-hmm. -[Inmate 34 grunts] -[grunts] [gasping] Really, James? Kidnapping after curfew? I mean, I get it. Lesson three, everything's a test. -[Inmate 34 groans] -[Sam] It's not a simulation! [Inmate 34 grunts] -Freeze! -[grunts] [grunts, groans] [insects buzzing] [Inmate 34 groans] [James] Sam? Another time... Snowflake. [James] What happened? There was this really scary guy, and he had powers too, and he threw January and Sam without even touching them. Go to your rooms. Lock the doors right now. -Who was he? -He's a very dangerous telekinetic. -Yeah, no kidding. -We have to go after him. That's out of the question. He called me "Snowflake." Only my father did that. -Stand down, Sam. -How did he know? That's an order. Okay. Go to your rooms and stay there. [echoing] Sam! Hey! Wait! [Sam breathing heavily] [breathing heavily] [heart beating] [gasps] Who are you? [grunts] [gasping] [James] Stop! -Hello, James. -Surrender. You know I won't. [Sam grunting] [grunting] [grunting, groaning] [grunting] [groans] [grunting] You can't win. There's too many of us. All I need is one. [grunts] -[grunts] -[groans] [groans] -[January] James! -[Tuma] January! [Matteo] Sam! [Roxana] Sam! Sam! [breathing heavily] You knock out the original, -you knock out the power. -[Tuma] James! Tell me who you are. For the last ten years, it has been "Inmate 34." -[Matteo] January! -[January] Sam! But before your mother took my name away from me... [Tuma] James! ...I was your favorite uncle. [Tuma] January! My turn. [groans] Hey. I've got your back, always. Let's go find the others. [female paramedic] All right. Here we go. Two bumps, and up. Radio the university and let them know we're ten out. [male paramedic] Will do. All right, just hooking him up here. [female paramedic] Vitals are stable. We'll start O2 if we need to. [male paramedic] Gotcha. I'm right behind you. Let 'em know we're on our way. This is all my fault. Hey, no. You did what you could to stop him. [sirens wailing] [Catherine] James is in intensive care. You put his life and yours in danger because you disobeyed an order. Is he really my uncle? [sighs] -Sam, it's complicated. -I'll make it simple. There was no plane crash. The empty frame on the wall, the man who betrayed the Society, that was Edmond. Is my father still alive too? No, darling. He's not. Edmond wanted to be king, so he murdered your father. I uncovered the truth before he claimed the throne, but nobody could know. Trust in the royal family would've been shattered. So you lied. I did the only thing I could. He killed my dad. And my husband. I stripped Edmond of his identity. I locked him up in our most secure prison. It's no coincidence he escaped so close to the coronation. He wants the throne, and he wants revenge. I wanna see him. Mom, please. [beeps] -[Edmond] Hey. -Snowflake. You wanna learn how to play? Come on over here. So all you have to do is you just strum the guitar like that. Can you do it? You're officially a rock star, yeah. [Edmond] Catherine? Have you come to gloat? Make it quick. Hello, Sam. Uncle Edmond. It's been a long time since I've heard my name. How could you kill your brother? It's an electric cage. And this collar projects a field that nullifies my power. Come closer. I loved my brother, you know? But great causes demand great sacrifices. You wanted power? I wanted to tear down the monarchy so that the people could live as citizens, not subjects. But your father wanted to wait. He said that change takes time. But that way nothing gets done. So you murdered him. You will never forgive me for what I've done, Snowflake. At least now you understand why. [Sam] El? [Eleanor] Sam. Didn't realize you were back. Summer school was a bust. Hey, at least now you can help me prepare for the coronation. Just please don't be late for once. You have no idea what I'm dealing with. Do you think you have it tough? You get to do whatever you like, and I have to live up to everybody's expectations because you never do. I never asked you to do that for me. You didn't have to. What is that supposed to mean? You were so young when dad died, and you took it so hard. I chose to be the perfect princess, so you could just be free to be a kid. And sure, there are some parts of the kingdom that feel old-fashioned, but I'm about to be in a position to enact real change. That means something to me, and every time that you yell, "Down with the monarchy," you are rebelling against everything that I stand for! [scoffs] [Roxana] I didn't realize it was going to get this real, this fast. Do you think Sam's coming back? Maybe, or maybe not. I mean, she almost got herself killed. She almost got James killed. Who even was that crazy guy? I have a bad feeling we're gonna find out sooner rather than later. Well, what are we meant to do now? Keep practicing. [Roxana] They'll give us a new teacher. -And what about the coronation? -Sam said she'd get us in. We should be there for her. Right? [somber guitar music playing] You awake? Yeah. I can't sleep either. Yeah, I know why. You're too excited to hang out with Roxana at the coronation. [chuckles] Be quiet. What I'm actually thinking about is what's gonna happen after that. If we're gonna get in. Into the Society? Yeah. For the first time in my life, I feel I could do something that actually matters. And let's be honest, royalty by day, superhero by night sounds pretty dope. No matter what happens, I'm glad I got to meet you. Hey, don't laugh. I'm not. I feel the same way. [sighs] This has been one crazy summer. [knocks] [Sam] Hey. How are you feeling? I'm a little sore still, but I'll be okay. I brought you a snack. Figured you could use a break from hospital food. Is this a bagel? You really are trying to kill me. Oh, don't worry. It's gluten-free. -You remembered my allergy. Put it there. -[Sam] Mm-hmm. [sighs] I feel terrible about what happened. You told me not to go after Edmond, and I should've listened. If it weren't for me, you wouldn't even be in here. Well, I am always right, but I forgive you. And I'm not entirely convinced that Edmond was working alone. We may not have seen the end of this. I was just starting to find my place... you know? I finally meet royals I actually get along with, and I was figuring out my powers. And then it all falls apart. Sam... I'm a second-born too, remember? I know what it's like to feel alone. And, thankfully, there's, like, 20 of me to keep me company, but... [chuckles] You're meant for great things. I really wanna believe that. Well, I do, and you should. And when the moment comes, you'll be ready. Enough of this mushy stuff. Give me my bagel and get out of here, okay? Yeah. [sighs] [Catherine] Happy birthday, darling. You look like a queen. What if I'm not ready? Can I tell you a secret? I wasn't ready either. Act like the leader they believe you to be. That's how you become one. [cheering] -Your Lordship, please. Thank you. -[shutter clicking] [Matteo] Props to Sam for coming through. [Tuma] It's hard to impress me, and even I'm impressed. [Roxana] Every single important royal in the world is here. [sighs] Is this not the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? It is. Too bad James can't be here. Hey, where's Sam anyway? Probably helping Eleanor get ready. Hey, excuse me, ma'am? I'd love one of those mints. It's my last one. Please. [whispering] That's weird. My powers aren't working. Where's January? This is a restricted area. Oh, hi. The queen sent me to check on the prisoner. We're gonna need confirmation. Open the door, now. [beeping] The plan is working. The apples were a brilliant idea. Sorry, I'm late. I had to steal Tuma's power. Nicely done. Epsilon 97 red Q zero. [cell powers down] None of them have any idea that we're working together. They truly suspect nothing. Phase two. Hey, there you are. Did you take my power? Come with me. All of you. Where? I don't wanna miss the coronation. Yeah, you do. Where's Sam? -How should I know? Give me back my p-- -Don't speak. The rest of you too. [insect buzzing] [computer beeping] [female electronic voice] Scanning all systems. Emergency alert systems deactivated. Communications deactivated. Stop. The alarms and external communication's been disconnected. I disabled the master code. [January] Smart. Even if Catherine figures out what's going on, she won't be able to stop us. We can still move in and out of here using this pin. Come with me. Get in the cell. All of you. [beeps] [cell locks] You'll thank me later. [door closes] [insect buzzing] Matteo? January, report. I put the second-borns in your cell. You're clear all the way to the target. Excellent. Everything is going according to plan. Proceed to phase three. [chattering] We have a straggler. Epsilon 97 red Q zero! Sam knows something's up. Catch her before she becomes a problem. [female electronic voice] Security system linked. -[clicks, beeps] -[female voice] Nano-device activated. Calibrating DNA target parameters. There are moments in the life of every leader and every parent that stand apart. This is one of them. I could not hope for a more deserving successor... and a more perfect daughter. [security system beeping] Hard way it is. Mike! Mike, I know you're in there! [knocking] -Mike! -Shouldn't you be at the coronation? I need your help. It's important. What? More important than our gig? -Go ask your new best friend. -Mike, I'm serious. People are in danger. It's an emergency. What kind of emergency? I can't tell you. Sounds familiar. Bye. Wait. No, okay. I-- Remember how I could read the numbers from really far away and smell what you had for lunch? Yeah, so? Well, it turns out I have powers, and summer school was a training program for a secret society of royal superhumans run by my mom. My uncle killed my dad. He escaped jail. My new best friend is his spy, and she can mind control people. And the palace is on lockdown, and they're about to do something really horrible to everyone at the coronation. [breathes heavily] That was the worst story ever. [Eleanor] Thank you all for being here. I've been preparing for this day my entire life. Queen of Illyria is a great responsibility. Stop. I love this power. Drop it. Don't worry. I'm not going to hurt you, but I can't let you ruin things either. You pretended to be my friend so that I would show you how to sneak into the palace. Sorry, Sam. I made a deal with Edmond. I help him, he gets rid of my brother. We've been working together all along. I deserve to rule. And I can't kill my brother myself. That would make me an awful person. I'm just looking out for my kingdom. Why did Edmond wanna get caught? Aren't we nosy? Let's just say, everyone of royal birth at your sister's coronation is about to have a really bad day. I don't think I properly introduced you to my best friend, Mike. Who? [grunts] Bull's-eye. I'm glad I believed you. -Mike, I'm so sorry. -It's okay. All right. What now? I have to save my family. Wrong. We have to save your family. Look, I know it's dangerous, and I don't have powers, but friends don't let friends save the world by themselves. Okay. [device beeping] [whispering] -You have a Batcave under your house? -That's what I said. Come on. [Tuma] Sam! [controls beep] The scary guy's on the loose. And January-- I know. We have to go after Edmond. -He's been working with January all along. -Wait, who's Edmond? -The scary guy. Also, her not-dead uncle. -I knew that guy would come back. -And who are you? -Mike Kleinberg. So... He's my best friend. Edmond wanted to get caught. Coming after me at school was a ruse. He needed something from this place. Something only the Society-- DNA-based nano-device, programmed to target specific genes. -It's gone. -One more time using small words. Think of a device that only works on certain people who share specific genetic traits. Like hazel eyes or freckles. January said that everyone of royal birth is about to have a bad day. Edmond is going to unleash the device at the coronation. It'll wipe out everyone with a royal bloodline, including my family. -Well, we have to call for help. -[Sam] There's no one left to call. James is in the hospital. My mom is leading the coronation. This one's on us. There's a way we can use the device to stop him. You want us to go up against him? We have something he doesn't. He's alone. We are a team. He's more powerful than any of us, but he's not more powerful than all of us. -Who's with me? -[Tuma] Let's do this. Obviously, I'm in. I can't sit this one out. [Sam] Edmond wore a collar in custody. It radiates a field that cancels powers. So, we just have to put it around his neck? Without him killing us with his pinkie. Or we get the other collars from his cell, and we build a trap. Here's the plan. We split up. That way he won't see us coming. Tuma, you climb up the elevator cable. Why can't I ride it? He'll hear it coming and send it crashing to the ground. -Oh. -I'll take the north air duct. Sweet. I'll free-climb the side of the palace. Sounds dangerous. [Roxana] Relax. I'm invisible. I'm just gonna take the stairs. All right. Well, what about me? You and Matteo are the most crucial part of the plan. [device beeping] [female electronic voice] Ready for deployment. [clicks, beeps] [Sam] Don't do it. Eleanor hasn't done anything to you. And neither have any of the people in there. This is the new beginning. Freedom. And not only for Illyria, but for the other kingdoms as well. It's a world without royals. Isn't that what you want? Not like this. This isn't freedom. It's murder. Time is running out, Snowflake. And you cannot defeat me. Not by myself. Disarm the device. Surrender now. You're not powerful enough to control me. I know, dude, but I made you look. [grunting] [Tuma] Give it. Give it. I'm right here! -Tuma! -Roxana! [grunts] [grunts] Come on! Yes! [grunts, pants] [panting] Do you swear to uphold the laws of Illyria? I do. [panting] [Mike] Hi. -[grunts] -Not gonna happen. We brought the collars from your cell. Your powers aren't gonna work in here. And without your powers, it's game over. Give me that or we're both gonna die. You programmed this thing to target royals. But we reprogrammed it to trap you. [Edmond grunts] [Edmond grunting] [screaming] [female electronic voice] Activation imminent. Three. Two. One. [rapid beeping] [Mike coughs] [Edmond screams] -[beeps] -[female voice] Subject acquired. [Mike] Sam! It's over. Your plan worked. We got him. Rise a queen. Congratulations. Nothing is impossible if you work together. [James] Welcome to The Secret Society. I had faith in you guys from the beginning. [Catherine] Go ahead, take your pins. You've earned them. Hey, Charlie. Give me a kiss, give me a kiss, give me a kiss. I've gotta say, James, dope idea having me practice on Charlie. I have a confession to make. Your power only works on humans, not dogs. Charlie obeys your commands because he likes you. So what was the point? To make you care about something other than yourself. [chuckles] [Sam] El. I just wanna tell you how grateful I am for what you and your friends did. Mom told me everything. She doesn't want any more secrets in our family. Well, it was my turn to protect you. I'm sorry about what I said earlier. You're not wrong that some things do need to change. For my first order as queen, I'm giving the people of Illyria a choice of having a parliament alongside the monarchy. We're more alike than you think. [chuckles] A few hours ago, a bank in Geneva considered impenetrable was robbed. Our intel suggests the funds may be used to finance a coup. We recovered a partial fingerprint. It matched to our database. As you know, we have Edmond in custody, but January remains free. She left that print on purpose. It's a message. "Come and get me if you can." You're going to do just that. The jet is fueled. -[Matteo] Whoa. We have a jet? -Wheels up in ten. Be careful out there. We got this, Mom. I know you do. [James] I've trained some very impressive second-born royals in my day, but this class, they may just be our most promising operatives yet. Pretty cool, huh? Well, what are you waiting for? A royal invitation? Let's go.
