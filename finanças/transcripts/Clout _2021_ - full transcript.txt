You were so good for me. See that's your problem Taurus. Everything has to be about you and what you need. Like when we were engaged and you had to be with a different bitch in every city you played in. So now I have my career. I'm supporting it. I have a new podcast. I'm supporting all of that, I'm supporting everything. Why are you like this, why do you always do this? Just go be the professional thot athlete that you always been. Angie, you know I'm not like that. I can't tell. It was just a phase. Oh, it was a phase? So what, you outta the phase now? I deserved that so I'm not even mad at you but either way, I still miss you. Boy, please. Angie you are the one I'm gonna settle down with. Whether it be now or later. Taurus you were back on the field in the week. This is when you're in tunnel vision, right? Let's just focus on that. See how well you know me. Tag, I can't. What the fuck you doing here, Teyana. I was trying to figure out why you were ignoring my calls but I guess I know now. Let me explain somethin' to you. I'm single, we had a fling, I don't owe you shit. Let's keep it a buck, I gave you the best week of your fuckin' life. So you just gon' ghost me like that. You dated a baller for a week, bitches would kill to be in your position, chillin' in my condo, chef service, shopping spree, meetin' celebrities. Not to mention, I gave you some good ass dick, I'm talking 'bout, put you to sleep. So just take it for what it was, it's over now. Good morning. Teyana, how you get up here? Look, don't worry about that. I just wanted to bring you a piece offering. I know your chef doesn't come on the weekend so I brought us some breakfast, no strings attached. Hey Teyana, this is the last time, like for real. Okay, I promise. Now, go freshen up for whatever. I'll get this ready for you. Teyana, Teyana, this is the last time. Okay, I know. Wake your ass up, man. I left my charge, I'm coming up to get it, this nigga. Man, you don't ever answer yo, phone. What's going on here? Hey, what happened? I gave him pills. What kind of pills? I don't know, my brother said they help with sleeping. I put 'em in his drink. Why the hell would you do that? I was just mad, I was trying to get back at him. He hurt me. I can help you. You can? Yeah, 'cause I've been telling this nigga, stop treating women like that. You know, womanizing and shit. I think he deserves it. So I'ma tell everybody that I came up here to check on him and nobody was here. Give you a couple days with him. But why would you help me? I thought you were gonna call the cops. Nah, we, are helping each other. And teaching this nigga a lesson. You have some more of them pills. Yeah. All right, if he starts to wake up, give him some more. Keep him down, but don't fuck around and kill him. Just give him enough to keep him asleep. Okay. I'ma go to practice. You know, so everything seems normal. Don't leave and don't let nobody know that you here. All right, I'll take his phone and I'll call you later. Help me grab this nigga. Okay.

You cut his reel to make him look like the star when actually it was the other guy. Yeah I went back and watched all their videos on blackface. That Brix kid. Yeah. He's the genius. You get him in my movie, then and only then we'll call it even. Goddammit! So the people wanna know, will Brix and Trey be making any more content together? Trey's doing his own thing and I'm doin' mine. Sometimes you get to a point where your journey becomes solely yours. He's a very talented individual. I wish him nothing but the best. Solely yours, he's a very talented individual. I wish nothing with the best. What the fuck is this! Fix this now because without him you are finished, finito! He won't talk to me! Trey, I put my reputation on the line for you. I went above and beyond and you can't even act. Do you know how that makes me look? Find a way to make him listen and get him on board. Well it's like trying to sell life insurance at a funeral, right? Right. Yo man, I need to talk to you bro. It's cool, it's cook, it's cool, it's cool. Okay nigga, what's up. Privately.

Look man, I told you all that because I know what type of nigga you are. Yeah, impressionable, always needin' attention. Always trying to fit in somewhere. Trey, he was a paw my nigga. Anybody who would give up their homeboy like that, is a easy target. Give up my homeboy, what you talkin' about? This ain't ever been about you. It been about Brix, man. We all know that he the one with the talent, even you know that. So we gas you up just enough to get you to do what we wanted you to do. Yo, so that night at the Blackface party. Doo, doo-dooh. Yo, that was playing. Checkmate bitch. It's only a matter of time before Brix blows and I'll be there to collect. Ain't nothin' like having a little dirt on a nigga, right? Yo man, how much. What you mean how? Yo how much for the video, Quick? I'ma need you to back up first but I'm pretty sure we can come up with some fair negotiations. What's up with Hercules over there, man. Ain't about to do nothin'. Wow man, these kids these days. Aye and don't forget to have those notifications up because you're gonna get to check out my new interview with the My Political Podcast, all right? I see y'all next time, peace. Oof! Hey baby.

It's cool bae. Okay. Yo, was this shorty from the radio station? Yep. Damn! Look man, I don't, I know you don't really talk to me right now but I got something you might wanna see. Trey, what the fuck is this man? Man, you gotta believe me, I had nothing to do with this. Quick and his friends, they drugged you at the party and they filmed this. Get away from me, Trey, yo get the fuck out, get out! Yo, I can't through that! All right, not until you agree to do the movie. That's the deal. Yo, this video will never see the light today. Are you kidding me? Not only do you backs stab me and let these get one up on me. Now you blackmailing me too. Who the fuck are you bro? Who are you! Yo! Yo, just do the movie. I don't wanna expose you. Nigga then don't! Do you know what the media do if this video get leaked? They will eat your ass up. Yo, just think about that, man. Yo, is it worth losing all of this? Yo, just do her favor for a friend, man. You know we do a couple of movies, do a couple of skits, easy. Hm, help a friend. Yeah, man. Right? We not friends Trey, you made that crystal clear. You know what? You do whatever you need to do with that movie but right now I'ma need you to get the fuck up out of my studio, you feel me? All right man, all right.

This is not your fault. Mm-hm. You're the victim, you're the victim of this screwed up industry. You're the victim being loyal to the wrong person. Brix, this does not make you less of a man, what happened. We're gonna get through this together. You got this, babe. I know that you all have seen screenshots and videos posted all over social media and today I'm gonna address it. I was a victim and I was drugged and filmed without my consent. The guilty party is attempted to blackmail me. That's my truth. I think it's important for me to address this publicly because we have to normalize letting Black men be vulnerable. We get victimized too. And we should be able to express ourselves in a safe space. And what's worse is I was betrayed by someone I once called my best friend. I refuse to be threatened, I refuse to be silent. I appreciate y'all's love and support, peace. That was so powerful. Thank you babe. You know, you're nothing without your team. You know, I'm just happy to be able to do something positive with my brother. You know, I got his back and he got mine. We get victimized too and we should be able to express ourselves in a safe space. I just feel so sorry for Brix. Trying to do everything he can to uplift his friend and he still got snake that quick. That's why you gotta watch the ones that's close to you, it be your own people. But anyways y'all, this is my last procedure. After this, I'm gonna look like the bomb show Barbie. I always wanted to be. See y'all on the other side, smooches. What's going on y'all? It is your girl, Donna Diva! Yes and I am in here with my BFF Stacey! She's in recovery right now but trust me, she's going to look fabulous. Make sure you guys follow her and send her L-O-V-E. Hey baby, check your phone. Let me see. Donna, how do you do this? My page is going up right now. It's got you such a fucking baddie. I post somethin', I get the little baby ass likes from my followers, small little dedicated fans. Girl, what are you talkin' about? You are a baddie too. And truth be told, you didn't even need to get all this work don, you was already beautiful. All right? Yeah, truth be told. You know, I never was the pretty friend. I always been the cool one. Nobody ever picked me. Stacy, don't say that. It's true, you know, sometimes I really envy you. I mean, you're gorgeous and you make it all look so easy and you keep gettin' booked for stuff. Meanwhile, my agency about to drop me. I ain't booked nothin' in two years. I was regular and it wasn't enough. So I got my nose done and I got my body done just so I can compete with girls like you. And now after I heal I'm going to be a baddie just like you. I'ma get my little followers up, I'ma be perfect. Stacy, you're already perfect. Okay, the grass isn't always greener. I get depressed too. I gotta be this character all the time. Living for the internet, act a certain way, look this certain way. It's stressful. I mean, you're beautiful. That sounds like a good problem to have. When you look like this, people respect you. When you look like how I used to look, you're invisible. But you're not invisible. Okay, you are beautiful, always have been beautiful. And if nobody else can see that, then guess what? It's their loss, all right, you're beautiful inside and out. Thanks boo. You ain't gonna need these are you? Donna! What! You're just playing. Just get surgery you'll be skinny. Girl, I am manifesting right now. All I'm thinkin' about is a size two and me lookin' like a yield sign, just stick and head. You need to look like an exclamation point, stand up. Yes! We gotta go, I'm feeling like I'm gettin'... Excuse me ladies. I don't mean to interrupt but you ladies are gorgeous. Thanks. And that bone structure, oof it's perfect, I love it. Oh, excuse me, where are my manners? My name's Carlos. I don't do hands. Hi, I'm Stacy. This is my rude friend Donna. Don't worry about her, she's harmless. She has trust issues. Whatever, hey.

Thank you so much, thank you, thank you. I will be on time! Okay, bye. Oh thank you Jesus. Oh god is so good! Why are you yelling in here? Okay, you're not gonna believe this. So I just got booked on Perry Tyler's new show as a series regular. Give your girl some! Oh. Damn! I think I'ma do this. Okay, I don't know, I just don't feel right about it. You know, the man seemed real rapey. You're just jealous 'cause he noticed me first and he thinks I'm a baddie. I'm jealous? Yeah. Stacey, I tell you you're beautiful all the time. Do I not? And now I'm jealous of you? Wow, see the only thing has changed lately is you and that little funky ass attitude of yours. Which I'm not likin'.
