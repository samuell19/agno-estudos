[upbeat jazz music] [murmuring] [claps] ["Oh, When the Saints Go Marching In" instrumental] - Oh, death, as it must to all men, came to William Topaz McGonagall, me. Mind you, there's the best Christmas box I ever had. Born earlier. Died later. But my story does not start here. It starts here, in the Theater Royal, Dundee. - [Man] Brothers! Fellow workers! [cheers] I've come up here, from downtown, from London, to call to you, my brothers, the Scottish workers! [cheers] - I'm gonna tell you something. The condition for the workers and the working class in this country is bloody disgusting. [cheers] Are we gonna do something about that? 'Cause I'm gonna tell you now whose fault is it the condition of some bloody oaf. - [Man] Whose fault is it? - I'll tell you. Hers! [boos] - [Voiceover] That very evening I had been accosted by the Provost of Dundee as was his custom who tried to sell me a ticket to the royal command performance. He wanted [clears throat] a pound's four for it, but finally, I knocked him down. Before he could get up, I had gained a bit and said it was there reading on the blind side of a candle, searching desperately through the Unclaimed Wills column of the newspaper, I first came under the spell of the royal enchantress, Queen Victoria, the Mark Phillips of her day. [O Tannenbaum jazz music] - Pass the wine! [raucous shouting] - Excuse me. Excuse me, out of my way. By God's reigning hand! [shouting] - Pardon me, but are you Queen Victoria? - What did you say there? - I said are you Queen Victoria? - Am I Queen Victoria, Albert? - Of course you are, my dear. - Yes, I am, yes, yes. - God prosper long our noble Queen. Long may she reign. Maclean, he tried to shoot her dead, but it was all in vain. [moans] But God, He turned the ball aside. Maclean aimed upon her head. And he was very angry because he did not shoot her dead. Arrest that traitor before he can ask amnesty. - [Voiceover] Then, instead of speaking, I said, - Do not go, Your Majesty. Pausing only to walk there myself, I suddenly went like that.

Willy Willy Winkie, are you gonna say it with me? - [Both] Willy Willy Winkie runs through the town upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown. - Very good! You'll be able to tell the baby yourself, won't you? - This must be the place. - Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip! [door creaking] - Oh, it's your father. Hello, Willy.

For heaven's sake, let me have it! [laughs] - A man has to do what a man has to do! [laughs] [audience laughs] - [Voiceover] About this time, a very important thing that would affect me later on happened in distant Africa. That's distant Africa now. And this is distant Africa much closer in. See. [howling] [horse galloping] [whinnying] This was one Second Lieutenant Frederick Rollo claiming to be a sincere well-wisher of mine. He entered into a literary correspondence with me. - To Sir William Topaz McGonagall G.H.A.D.W.A.B. 19 Paver's Lane, Dundee, Scotland, Great Britain. Nigger! - [Servant] Getting nearer. Bum bum bum bum, bum bum bum bum, bum bum bum bum. Yes, bwana? [puffs] - Make haste. We're being attacked at dawn tonight. - Oh, shit. [laughs] [rooster crowing] - Time for your Zulu war, sir. - Those are the black ones, sodomy? - That's right, sir. [war cries] - You're alright, son. [war cries] - Zulu warriors getting closer, sir. - Start the massacres. - Sir! Alright, now. Don't look at me, don't look at me. Keep your eyes on the advancing impis. [battle cries] Wait for it, wait for it. In your own time, fire! [yelling] - [Churchill] Quiet out there. I'm doing a report for the game. Piss off! - Ah, listen to this, Jean. Oh. Oh, yo! To the authorities of Berlin in honor of the Emperor consider it no sin to decorate with crape the beautiful city of Berlin. Therefore, Berlin, I declare, was a city of crape, because few buildings crape decoration did escape. Ah, did I really write that, Jean? Did I really write that? - Aye, you did, Willy. - Aye. [knocking] - I'll get this. - Hey. - Had a hard day? Sir William Topaz McGonagall, Grand Knight of the Holy Order of the White Elephant of Turson Street, New Burma? - Aye. - This is for you. I love that woman! - Quiet! - Well, Jean, it's from the First Royal Scots Fort Curtis Erhowe, Zululand, British Empire, Africa. - [Jean] That's nice. - Hey! - Dear Poet McGonagall, I recently received a copy of your poems from home. You black devil, take that! - Take this, my first opportunity of congratulating you, on the production of such a splendid work. - One can only wonder how you could produce such a selection of poems, commencing as you did in such a late stage in life. - Oh, I can't take that. - [Lieutenant] I loaned your book to a number of good friends and they one and all said that it far surpasses any of the so-called poets of the present day. [screaming] - Hoping this finds you fit and well, as I am your sincere well-wisher, - Frederick Rollo, First Royal Scots, news at 10, Nairobi. - P.S. - There's no P.S. - Oh, dear. [Military Taps] [knocking] - You're late. - Sorry. - Any reply? - Yes. There is no reply. - Africa's a bloody long way. - I know that! [knocking] [laughing] - [Voiceover] Aye, that was the day. The night I discovered myself to be a poet. The kit came complete with quill pen, berry, and clock. - No work again today. Thank God. [classical music] - [Voiceover] It wasn't easy for my wife Jean and myself, William. We had just put down the first tire purchase installment on a Christmas dinner for the winter, thereby postponing some much needed affairs to the people's floor above us whose roof was leaking. - Jean! - Good night, dear. Happy, darling! [upbeat music] - [Voiceover] It was during the Dundee holiday week in the faraway month of June that I realized we had both overslept. I seemed to be lost away in this kind of feeling stealing over me. A flame seemed to kindle up my entire bed frame. For the first time, I had a strong desire to write. - [Loud voice] Poetry! - To a cow. [mooing] [hen clucking] - The hen is a noble beast. A cow is more forlorner, standing in the rain with a leg at every corner. - Willy, it's four o'clock. You have to be at work at six. - Jean, tomorrow morning, I'm gonna give up my job as a-- prompt! - As a full-time unemployed weaver. - Full-time unemployed weaver. And give myself over to the Muse. My genius will be our provider. - Oh, jeez! I come for the rent. - Oh, Mr. Stewart! If you could give us a little time-- - Alright, lads! Get it up! RIght, come on, son! - Not the child! No, not the child! I have a check in the bush. Over my dead body, you'll take any of this. [screams] [grunting] - [Voiceover] Belying his unreasonable appearance, Mr. Stewart turned out to be a very reasonable unreasonable man. [fast gibberish] - I humbly beg the court for time to pay. - And why is it that you cannot pay Mr. Stewart the five pounds six shillings which is owed to him by his rent? - It's something to do with the shortage of money. - Will you answer the question? - Yes! - What is your trade? - For 20 years now, I have worked patiently as an unemployed weaver and I am currently training to be a poet and a genius. - Get your ass out your hairpiece! - Prithee! Beware! Never interfere with a poet's hair! Christ the savior had long hair and many more good men too, I do declare! - Who employs you? What are your wages? - I'm self-employed, so there's no wages. But, once or twice a year, I write one or two poems, but it's not what you'd call regular employment. - What would you call it, then? - Unemployment. [laughs] - How much could you afford to pay each week? - A week? [gulps] I was thinking a fourpence a year, my lord. - At that rate, it would take you nearly 100 years to repay the debt. - I'm a patient man. - Mr. McGonagall, can you think of any reason why you should not be sent to prison? - Yes. - After all, you are a self-confessed poet, but does that make you any different from the rest of us? - Different only that I am everyday subjected to the continual punishment by the forces of so-called law and order who prohibit me from performing my works in public, thereby denying me my right to earn my living as a training genius! Yesterday, at the unveiling of Rabbie Burns's statue, I tried to lay a memorial wreath and read one of my poems. But alas, I was stopped from doing so by one of your Bobbies! [raspberries] - Silence in court. What poem was this, Mr. McGonagall? Will you favor the court by reading the poem to us? - Oh oh, oh, immortal Rabbie Burns of Ayr, there's few poets can with you compare. Some of your poems and songs are right fine, To Mary in Heaven is most sublime. And then again, in your Cottar's Saturday Night, your genius there does shine most bright. as pure as the dew drops of the night. Oh, of the night! - 30 days. Next poem, please. - Dear Jean and the Burns, I'm being rolled of batter. But cheer up, buddy. [loud clash] - On your feet, prison doctor! - Stand on that mirror. You filthy swine! - Dear Jean, can you please send a pair of clean underpants? - [Voiceover] Despite me and my candle being thrown into an unknown prison, my native genius still flowered, even standing up. - Oh, beautiful city of-- beautiful city of-- of Edinburgh! Edinburgh. Capital E, capital E. Beautiful City of Edinburgh, the truth to express, your beauty is matchless I must confess. Oh, but none dare gainsay, if you are not the second most beautiful city in Scotland at the present day. - [Voiceover] Dundee, of course, being the first. Not forgetting also the fair city of Glasgow, where I was sent to school at an early age, and remained for some considerable time. - McGonagall, what's the shape of the world? - I do not know. - What's the shape of your father's cuff links? - Square. - Not the ones he wears on Sundays, on weekdays! - Round. - Very well then, McGonagall. What's the shape of the world? - Round on the week and square on Sundays. [laughs] [distant singing] [upbeat show music] - Uh, warden? - Yes? - I don't know how to tell you this. [upbeat music] - Uh, in another way... [upbeat music] - Could I have two suppers tonight? - [Voiceover] During my guest appearance at Her Majesty's prison, I spent the evenings improving my handwriting and perfecting the art of reading. The books I liked best were Shakespeare's plays, McVicar's editions, especially Macbeth, Othello, and the Two Gentlemen of Verona. I knew now exactly where I was. - Now, where was I, now? Oh! [chuckles] Oh, now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by this sun of York. Hey, come on, hey, come on, a horsey! - You are a little ill now. You take that, and you'll feel better, eh? - Thank you, ladies and gentlemen! For my next impression, I will be doing the unhappy Othello the Moor of Venice. Oh, the pity of it all, Iago! Oh, Iago! The pity of it all. - William, William, I'm just off to bed. - Great, I'll be with you in a wee while. Desdemona, Desdemona. - [Voiceover] My first appearance on any stage was in Mr. Forrest Giles's Penny Theatre, Lindsay Street, Quarry, Dundee. The character I showed that evening was Mr. Macbeth. [jeering] - You're on in a wee while, Willy. - Aye. - Down a touch, Mr. Cronic. - I hear I'm on in a wee while, Willy. - Yes, now look here, McGonagall. One pound was the agreed price due to me for your representation as Macbeth in my theater tonight. - That is true, Mr. Giles. - Well, now, look here. So far, your workmates have only been able to raise 18 shillings. - Aye. - I therefore suggest we ring down the curtain a trifle early. Now, no one will be any the wiser. - Just a moment, Mr. Giles! I'll hazard that the value of my deceased grandfather's roan gold hunter is suffice to cover your cost and allow me my full length of performance here in Dundee tonight. - Three minutes, Mr. McGonagall. - Oh, no, it goes much longer than that. - Ladies... - Mr. Cronic? - [Giles] and gentlemen! Good evening! Our play tonight will be a tragedy. Well, in the grandeur of tragedy, Macbeth has no equal! - [Audience member] How about Othello? - [Giles] Othello, yes, well that is correct. But you must remember, dear sir, that he was of the tinted persuasion. Gentlemen and ladies, it has scenes and good sections absolutely too bold for representation. Therefore, we shall not attempt these. - [Audience member] Heh, good. - [Giles] Our production tonight will be an intimate one. And so, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in this theater, and in any theater in this or any other planet, appearing as the ambitious and unscrupulous Thane of Fife, it is Macbeth, your own, Dundee's very own William McGonagall! [cheering] Your turn. [jeering] [Eastern string music] [cheering] [gong] - Oh, [mumbling] [laughing] [speaking gibberish] [Eastern string rendition of "Amazing Grace"] - Mr. Giles says to speed up the fight scene. - What's that? - Despair thy charm! Did you hear me? - Speak up. - And let the angel whom thou still hast served tell thee, Speed it up. Macduff was from his-- it's alright. Macduff was from his mother's womb untimely ripp'd. - Oh! Oh! Ah! Wow! Accursed the tongue that tells me so! I'll throw my warlike shield away. - Watch it! - Lay on, Macduff! And curs'd be he that first cries out, "Hold on!" Hellfire! Wah! - What are you doing? I'm supposed to win. - Never! - What are you doing? I'm supposed to win. - Never! [laughing] - [Voiceover] Suddenly, I had an inspiration. I decided to change Shakespeare's plot and have Macbeth win. - Good idea, Willy! - [Voiceover] And though I kill him, I keep the fight going so long as the audience did not throw things. - [Willy] so long as the audience did not throw things. Ah! - Mr. Giles says to speed up the scene. [jeering] - Get on with it! [sped-up gibberish] [laughing] - Willy, you'll wake the children! Shh! [cheering] - Ladies and gentlemen, for your further pleasure, McGonagall dies again. [cheering] [silly arrangement of "Thus Spake Zarathustra"] [cheering] [gasps] [cries out] [gasps] - Behold! The accursed usurper's head. - Oh, thank God! [laughing] Ladies and gentlemen, you've been such a fine audience tonight. I could not rest in my grave as for Shakespeare. However, I would like to recite to you a new poem entitled "Mr. Giles's Music Hall." Oh-- Mr. Giles-- - [Voiceover] Such was the acclaim of the audience and my financial backers that I was begged to perform the play three times, the ultimate accolade. And thanks to the generosity of the ticket-holders, that night, I invited the entire cast to a magnificent vegetable and fruit supper. - So, I decided to give him a chance in my theater tonight. [laughing] Oh! - Bravo, bravo! - [Giles] Oh! - Admirers from Edinburgh, Mr. McGonagall! A drink in celebration, Mr. McGonagall. - Pardon me, I do not imbibe. Mr. Macduff would like to see you apropos the outstanding anointments for the fish pie. - Yes, well I'll see to that. - I'll see you in a wee while, ladies and gentlemen. Well, I'll keep you a wee more. - As in the theater, the eyes of men when a well-graced actor leaves the stage are idly bent on him who follows next, thinking his prattle to be tedious. - William Shakespeare, if my memory serves me. Richard the two strokes. - You are acquainted with the Bard, Mr. McGonagall? - Alright, well could you stand over here? I wrote a poem to you. [sentimental music] [music stops] [sentimental music] - Oh! [laughs] Oh! Immortal Bard of Avon, your writings are divine, and live in the memory of his admirers until the end of time! [laughs] - Dreadful, isn't he? - Oh, your plays are read by families with wonder and delight seated around the campfire on a cold and brusky night. - Bloody awful! - Alright, then! Cup this, sir! Oh, beautiful bridge of the silvery Tay! - Where are the children? - Sorry, Jean! Oh, gee, these are some of my admirers that have come all the way down from Edinburgh to pay their respects to me. Ladies and gentlemen, this is my wife, Mistress McGonagall, who is with. [posh gibberish] Did you get that, Jean? - My dear McGonagall, such was your artifice that I thought this beard was your own. - It is my own, and these teeth are round. - But McGonagall, what about your genius? - Oh, day after day, she's doing princess treatment. - [Giles] Mr. McGonagall! - Sorry. - Mr. McGonagall, in the theater tonight bearing a message for you was an aide to a gracious majesty, Queen Victoria. - Oh, well, send him in! - Come in, Mr. Brown, sir! - Say, say, is anything worn under the kilt? - No! Everything is in working order. Ta-da! [flourish] [laughing] It's very good of you. - Aye, so you've heard about me, Mr. McBrown, sir? - Aye, and of your work! Many a night, Her Majesty sat up 'til the wee small hours listening when I read her aloud selections from your Poetic Gems. And I can tell you, Her particular favorite is "The Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay"! - Oh, beautiful bridge of the silvery Tay! Did you hear that, Jean? - Aye, - Oh, by the way, Mr. McBrown, sir, I'd like you to meet my wife, Mrs. Jean McGonagall, who is with. Fancy that! - An honor! You have my ravished success. - [McGonagall] Beautiful Bridge of the silvery Tay - You must learn the serum of the world. - [McGonagall] with your lovely arches in grand array. - You need to be more aware of that every morning, Mr. Brown. - Could I prevail upon you for your autograph, Mr. McGonagall? - Certainly, for you. - It's nae for me! It's for my Britannic employer, Her Majesty Queen Victoria. - Dear Queen Victoria, [laughs] - was your act at the palace great! - It's an honor, sir. And now, Mr. McGonagall, sir, I have the honor to bear this laissez-passer letter to you from Her Majesty, Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Empress of India. She is at present residing at Balmoral Castle and she requests that you repair there with all possible haste to favor her royal person with a recital of your songs and your poetry. - Ah! Oh! Tell Her Britannic Majesty, that her humble servant, William T. McGonagall, is deeply revered by the great honor that she bestows upon him. - I will. And now I must leave you. Affairs of state beckon. [laughs] Mistress McGonagall. - Mr. Brown. - Shall we say Balmoral Castle next Thursday at 4 P.M.? [laughs] - [Director] Keep going, keep going. - [Jean] What happened? - Shall we say-- should we say it again? - [Director] Keep going. You just say it. - Alright, alright. - Hold on, let' get this right. Last time I did it... - [Director] Keep rolling. Don't worry, just relax, just relax. I know, it was OK. OK, man it again. - [Man] He didn't say it. - [Director] I know, shh, OK, my turn. Action! - Shall we say Balmoral Castle next Thursday at 4 P.M.? - Joe, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. What was I supposed to say, there? - [Joe] It's, uh... - No, it's next Thursday at 4 P.M. Was that the line? - I'd like to do the take again, because it's all over the top. I was over the top. - [Director] No, just go from that and we'll pick it up after. So, it's next Thursday-- - Do you wanna go from there? - [Director] No, next Thursday at 4 P.M. Mark it, right. Oh, sorry, Balmoral. Whatever the line was. - RIght. - [Director] OK, mark it. - [Man] 93, take 3. - [Director] Stand back. Action! - Shall we say Balmoral Castle next Thursday at 4 P.M.? Sorry. - [Director] Mark it again. Just take a deep breath. - Am I, wait a minute, question. Am I supposed to repeat what he says? - [Director] Yeah, yeah. - No, he stopped because he laughed that time. - [Director] So, repeat it this time. Don't, you're just confusing the issue, John. - I repeat what he says after he says Balmoral? - [Director] Yeah, that's it. - [Director] You OK? OK. - Shall we say - [Director] Action! - Wait a minute, you didn't say "Action." - [Director] I did. There's only one. I'm trying to say it. - Sorry. - [Director] OK, sorry, sorry John. Action. - Shall we say Balmoral Castle next Thursday at 4 P.M.? - Balmoral Castle next Thursday at 4 P.M.? - [Director] OK, lunch. - Sorry.

And your good boots. - Aye, there's 60 miles to Balmoral. - Right. - Oh, and a fresh kilt. Aye, and a pair of braces. - What for? - I don't know, I just have that feeling.

You must stop him! He's erecting things all over the place. - I know, Mr. Brown, I know. But try as I may, I cannot talk Albert out of his erections. - Tea, Albert? - Ja, Vicky. - Sugar? - Nein. - One, two, three-- - [Albert] Vicky, - Four-- - [Albert] Why are you wearing the black dress? - Five.

I come here today to tea with Her Majesty the Queen and read her some of my Poetic Gems because I am... - There's no need for that, sir. William McGonagall! Your fame has preceded yourself. Might I ask you the favor of a small autograph? - This is for your daughter? - No, sir, it's for me. [laughs] - And thank you. My poetic pen. - Go right in, sir. Her Majesty is expecting you. Here's a wee bobby for you, Bobby. - Thank you, sir. You've got a lucky face. - [McGonagall] I got lucky to have a face! I was born Ayr East of Arran! - That sounds like the unknown Scottish poet, William McGonagall. - Come in, unknown Scottish poet William McGonagall. - Your Majesty, your humble Scottish servant. - That is correct. He is my most humble Scottish servant. - And who are you? - I am Queen Victoria. And I am very big in England. - Oh, Your Majesty Queen Victoria. I'm sorry that I did not recognize you the moment that I saw you. I now see that the fine queen, the finest I've ever seen. - Kneel. - Kneeling, Your Highness. - Hand me my dubber, Mr. Brown. - Oh, it's a great honor, Your Majesty. - I dub thee "mister." [huge bell clanging] Arise, Mr. William McGonagall, Poet Laureate. - Oh, congratulations, Your Majesty. Me, a Poet Laureate! Oh, Sir Tennyson will have something to say about this! - Not just at the moment, it's a bad time for me, actually. Come into the garden, Maud. For the black bat, night, has flown. Come into the garden, Maud. I am here at the gate alone. I am here at the gate alone! - Well. - Happy, darling? - Mr. McGonagall, what is it to be? - If I play my cards right! Well, Your Majesty, I thought perhaps an excerpt from my famous poem, "The Miraculous Escape "of a Fireman, Robert Allen, from the Burning Warehouse "in Buchanan Street in Glasgow" would do Your Majesty a power of good. - A new one. I would much prefer it were we to have a song. [waltz] - And then you wrote-- - Aye, then I wrote, I'm a rattling boy from Dublin town. - You courted a girl named Biddy Brown. - Her eyes were as black as actor's sloes. - She had red hair. - And an aquiline nose. - One night you caught her with another lad. - Says I, Biddy Brown, I caught you, by dad. - So with my darling shillelagh, - I gave him such a whack - [Queen] such a whack which left him lying on his back, - [Both] saying botheration to you and Biddy Brown. - Shall we dance, Your Majesty? [ballroom music] - Oy! Oy, oy! [moaning] [growling] [moaning] - Like it's the end of my kilt! [organ music] - Oh, stop! I can hear Albert on his organ. [German gibberish] - It's another of Albert's things. He calls it his Elsa erophonoscope. For my brave, brave troops at Balaclava. [slide whistle] [explosion] [airplanes whirring] - It's for projecting severe wounds onto the enemy. - Well, Your Majesty, but for my age, I too would have joined your army. - Oh, come now, Mr. McGonagall. You're only 45. - Aye, that's my age, but I do not-- - No, but come now, join up. Join up and travel to far and distant exotic places. Meet interesting and exciting people and then kill them. [loud war sounds] - Happy, darling? - Ideal. - I hope the day is not too far distant when every family in the land will be able to afford one of Albert's things. It is powered by steam, you know. - It's a Scottish invention. - Albert and I dance to it every night. Don't we, Albert? Hah! Ooh! You will agree that dancing by steam is a novel idea, Mr. William? - Oh, aye, aye. - It also projects selected postcard pictures. See! If you would be kind enough to give us your "Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay"? Albert and I will attempt to match your poetic vision with selected shots taken by Albert on our last Scandinavian haul. Oh! You really should have your whicker dusted, Albert. Turn on, darling. - Ja, Vicky. - [McGonagall] Oh! Oh! ["Amazing Grace" organ instrumental] - Oh! Oh, beautiful railway bridge of the silvery Tay! With your numerous arches and pillars in so grand array. And your central girders, which seem to the eye to be almost towering up to the sky. - Oh! The greatest wonder of the day, and a great beautification to the River Tay. Most beautiful to be seen, nearby Dundee and the Magdalen Green. - She kens my work! I notice your groomsman caught the son-in-laws. - Yes! He caught the daughter as well. I'm having him detained for my pleasure. - More steam, Mr. Brown! - Schnell! The Scottish instrument is boiling fit to burst! I will not be responsible for another operation. Very well, but on your own heads be it! - Oh, beautiful bridge of the silvery Tay! - Oh! - That has caused the Emperor of Brazil to leave his home far away. - Oh! - Incognito in his dress, and view thee ere he passed along en route to Inverness. Beautiful railway bridge of the silvery Tay, which has caused great rejoicing on the opening day. - And thousands of people came from far away to see the Queen, most gorgeous to be seen. - Hear, hear! - Oh, what a lovely holiday you had, Your Majesty! - [Both] Oh, beautiful railway bridge of the silvery Tay! And prosperity to Misters Bouche and Grothe, the famous engineers of the present day who have succeeded in erecting the railway bridge of the silvery Tay, which stands unequalled to be seen, here by Dundee and the Magdalen Green. [explosion] - [Queen] Oh, shit! We are not amused. - Oh! Oh, oh! Babbling dreams, perish! The distant clock has stretched the hour out. [bell clangs] Two! But my heart has-- [bell clangs] Three! But my heart is-- [bell clangs] not for the day. [bell clangs] Four! [bell clangs] Five! [bell clangs] Oh! Ooh. [knocking] - What do you want? Keep moving. - I, good evening, inspector. I have been invited here to take tea and entertain her majesty with some of my Poetic Gems. And my name is-- - Keep moving. - No. - Hello, hello, hello. - I thought they said quite clearly that I've come here to take tea with Her Majesty and entertain her with some of my Poetic Gems. And my name is-- - Keep moving. - Look, here! I have here a personal letter of patronage to invite me hear to take tea today. - Thanks, Mr. Brown. - Not at all, Madam. - Brown! Did she say Brown? - Yeah, Brown, this is owned by him. What's he to you? - That man is an impostor! I've seen real John Brown! He's the man that wrote that letter! I tell you, the Queen must be protected! Arrest that man! - It's you who will be arrested if you're not careful. Now, on your way, or I'll have you for not having a poetic license. - Suddenly, McGonagall realized that he was the innocent victim of a cruel practical joke by Mr. Giles's theater. This poor misguided fool is only doing his duty and he's living proof that the Bobby of today is a real bastard. I'm thinking I'm undone. - Keep moving! - I'm thinking I'm undone. - Keep moving! - I'm thinking I'm undone! - Keep moving! [melancholy music] [coughing] - Oh, son, what have you been up to? - I've been up to here in snow. - How many times? - No, I went to Balmoral to see Her Majesty, the Queen. - What was the nature of your business with Her Gracious Person? - Oh, I went there to read some of my Poetic Gems. See, I'm the poet William T. McGonagall of Dundee. - Dundee? - Aye. - Well, I, for one, would like to hear a specimen of your abilities. - Oh, where? - Here. - Oh, no, father. No, no thank you, no. I would like to express them to an audience of a doctor and that's not in the open air. No, I'm a sterling mountebank, you understand me? If you wish to hear of my work, you'll have to take me inside and pay me what will be your just dues. - Oh, not just dues. We're just Catholics. [rowdy jeering] Dearly Beloved, We are gathered here today to hear the poet William McGonagall of Dundee. He has journeyed here to give us a selection of his Poetic Gems. I trust you will give him a fair hearing and keep good order. Oh! Incidentally! There will be a small silver collection taken up during this entertainment. Amen! - Thank you. I should like to commence with some recent jottings of my impressions of London town. [crowd jeering] - Oh! As I stood on London Bridge and viewed the mighty throng of thousands of people in cabs and buses rapidly whirling along, furiously driving to and fro, up one street and down the other as quickly as they could go, oh! The Tower of London, gloomy to behold! The crown of England lies there, bejewelled with precious stones and gold, and Henry VI was murdered there by the Duke of Gloucester, and when he stabbed him with his sword, he cried out, impostor! Oh! Mighty City of London! You're wonderful to see! [screaming] [crash] [upbeat saloon music] - And what's it to be this time? A large brandy? - No! You give me my money. I'll divert you and your friends no longer. - What money might that be, Mr. McGonagall? The collection! The money you collected in that plate. Oh! - Didn't you know? That collection was for the poor of the parish. - I am the poor of the parish. That must be clear to you! [laughing] I'm tired, weary, hungry, and footsore. And in dire need of... [laughing] sustenance. - Hello, cheeky. Want an honorable time? - No thank you, son. I'm already having one. [jeering] [upbeat saloon music] - Hello? Who's there? I must warn you, that I'm a veritable giant of the land, with muscles of steel and legs that bear a tire. And in seven day's time, I'll come and kick sun in your face. [people loudly talking] - Good night, sir. I said, what you gonna do? I says, no. And she says to me-- - Mark! - That's what smoking will do to a man. - A constable! Constable, you've got here in the nick of time. I'm being followed by some villainous men that might molest me the moment that I'm alone. - What would you like me to do, sir? - Well, I'd like you to, I would like you to accompany through the near woods unto the main Balmoral Road. - Oh, you see, sir, I'm afraid I cannot do that. Sir, you see, I'm off-duty, sir. But, if anyone offers to molest you, you shout out as loud as you can-- [shouts] [laughing] - I might be murdered in my bed by the time you get there. Murdered! - Sir, here. You take this whistle. Now, you blow it. [whistles] - No, no, no, you blow that real hard. [whistles] Oh, that was first-class. - Well, I always was musical. - Now, sir, listen here very carefully. Here's the plan. I'll be over here at the door, you see? Now, I'm going to be listening very carefully. - Ah! - If anyone offers to molest you-- - Aye. - Or attack you, son, you blow that whistle as hard as you can and I'll come to your aide. Good night, sir. [whistling] See you at home. Good night! [laughing] [farting] - Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale yet will I fear none ill, for Thou art with me now and Thy rod and staff me comfort still. And all will still be sound and safe. [thrashing] [loud whistling] - [McGonagall] Help! Help me! Ah! Ow! [laughing] - You go. You go, you go! I'll give you five minutes for looking. [screaming] [whistling] [spitting] - [Showman] Altogether, now! It's a-- - Wonderful country that we live in [music playing] with a culture hard to beat. - Willy. Willy, you'll wake the children. Willy? [crying] Is that you, Willy? - [Man] Come along now, everyone. Come on, the show's about to start. What are you doing? Get up off there, you're ruining the floor! I say! I say, who are you? Where are you from? - The gallery. - What is the matter with that man? - Everything, by the looks of it. Give me a hand with him. Now, come on. - Oh! - 'Tis McGonagall, the poet! - He's not very good, is he? - Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please! Is there a doctor in the house? - Yes, I am a doctor. - Enjoying the show? - Oh, absolute magic. [laughs] - Oh, oh, oh. - Say "The Cabbington Catastrophe." - The Cabbington Catastrophe. - How is he, doctor? - Who? - Him? - Oh, him, oh yes. He's suffering from an attack of Young Monroe's sailor. Mrs. McGonagall, will you stand in front of that screen and take your clothes off? - No. [coughing] Shh! - Ah! - William, you'll wake the children. [groaning] - Yes, well I gave him some laudanum. If he's not dead by morning, I'll call again. If he wakes, change his potties. - Yes. - Now will you stand in front of that screen and take your clothes off? - No. But do as the doctor says, Jean. He knows what's best for us. - Alright, Mrs. McGonagall, good night. - Jean. - Whatever happened to you? When they found you, you were nearly dead. - Well, they would not let me see Her Majesty. And they said if ever I go that way again, that I'll be arrested. - Hush, now, you're home. - Aye, yes, yes. - The Reverend Gilfillan took your diary of the journey and has had it published. - Oh, it's caused a great sensation. It's made you famous. Look, all these letters that have arrived for you. - Oh! - You lay there quiet and read them. Now I've some dumplings on the boil and a bun in the oven, and have your potties to change, so I'll be back in a wee while, yeah? Stonehaven, February the 24th, 1890. Right at - [Gilfillan] Right at that time. Sir William, I have read your epic journey to Balmoral for which I hope you are now none the worse. [seagulls calling] I am here in Stonehaven taking the sea hours for a few days, but will be returning soon to see you. I enclose a postal order for seven shillings and sixpence, being all this the price paid to me by the newspaper reporter for your diary. I am sure this will come in very useful. Your friend, George Gilfillin. - William! Alfred Lord Tennyson and King Theebaw of the Andaman Islands are here, and they want to see you. - Well, they'll have to make an appointment. - When for? - Now. - Come in! - [All] Into the valley of death rode the 600! - Right, sir! Which of these Lord Tennysons made the appointment with you? - Him! - Then the rest of you are under arrest. Outside. I'm taking you to the station, and I must warn you, et cetera, et cetera. [groaning] Heel! - Mm, into the valley of death rode the 600. - Heel, heel, heel! - Ah, this seems like a good place for it. I am ashen face Lord Tennyson, age 65. - Lord Tennyson is 71. - Inside leg, 42. Mr. McGonagall, sir. Having the honor to belong to the Holy Fraternity of Points, as you do yourself, I have been instructed by Her Most Gracious Majesty, Victoria, Queen of England and Ireland, Empress of India, and her beloved consort, Prince Albert, to apologize on their royal behalf for the treatment meted out to you by the security minion at the gates of Balmoral, their palace in the Highlands, built in the Scottish colonial style, ratable value, 250 pounds per annum, with overhead gables. And also to urge your acceptance of the great honor that has lately been bestowed upon you by the most illustrious presence, the King Theebaw. King Theebaw has long been aware, from afar, of the many injustices which you have suffered. - Jean-- - And your modesty on several occasions has been noticed by him. - Could you get a cup of tea? - Therefore, His Illustrious Presence summoned his royal court together and with the greatest aplomb and esteem, proclaimed it throughout his present palace and kingdom that he had a great desire and intention to honor you. - He's a real lord, children. A real lord. [clapping] [exotic music] That's a real chinky-poo king! - Dear most highly honored and respected sir, Dear most highly honored and respected sir, will you consent to accept this, our kingdom's highest honor? - Oh, I do, I do. - So be it. Kiss my ring. Kiss my ring! - I kissed your ring, king. - Therefore, be it known, from this day forward, you will be revered all the way from John o' Groats to Vandelay, and known to all as Mr. Sir William Topaz McGonagall, Grand Knight of the Holy Order of the White Elephant of Curzon Street and Burma, and Poet Laureate of the Andaman Islands, by order of King Theebaw, Theebaw the King. - Long may you live to enrich the literature of this Great Empire. - On which the sun never sets, but only growing tired. - Agreed, agreed. His Illustrious Presence instructs me to tell you-- - Would you like a cup of Tahiti? - Kind sugar. - Kind sugar. - Their value inestimable. He therefore wishes to tell me that he will not wound your delicate sensibilities by offering you any payment. - Are you sure about that? - Positive. - Ah, God. - Happy, darling? - Aye, aye. - Are you happy, darling? - Aye. - I'm happy too, then. I'm so tired, though. I'm so tired. I'm so very tired. - Mistress McGonagall? - [Jean] I'm coming, doctor. I've just got to take this bun out of the oven and I'm now going to change his potties. - That won't be necessary. - He's not dead? - Is that how you spell McGonagall? - I think so. - Good, that will be five shillings. - William McGonagall had been known to me for some 25 years. He had a great proclivity for the elocutionary department, a strong voice, and much enthusiasm. I've heard him recite passages from his own works, and from those of William Shakespeare with great force. I believe him to have been a simple, good, respectable man. He will be missed, and I hope, remembered. Let us pray. - [Voiceover] Oh! I earnestly hope the inhabitants of the beautiful City of Dundee will appreciate the poetry written by me. And some of them, I will hope, will let a silent tear fall in dear remembrance of William McGonagall. [sentimental music]
