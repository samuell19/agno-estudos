I'm not proud of every choice I've made over the last 15 years. Don't you dare tell me that you are. 'Cause you know what I got? I can still look in the mirror and like myself. I'm pretty okay in my own skin. Can you say that? You manipulative, soul-stealing, son of a bitch. Hmm? Can you? All right. Let's fucking go to this bar then. - What? - Let's go to this bar.
