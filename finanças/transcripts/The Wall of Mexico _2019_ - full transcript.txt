Well, the Goddess is dead, too. Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead. But, at least, when you get to the crime scene, the Goddess' corpse is on top. My chest feels weird, - feels hyper and weird. - We can't wait. All right, if you subtract the remainder... - Melanie! - How are you guys eating so much? We have a healthy lifestyle here. That's why we don't live in L.A. or Buenos Aires or wherever people live these days, so... Also note that there's only one holding. Therefore, reconciliation should be fairly simple. - Melanie! - Simple. Drink a glass of water. - You'll feel all better. - Yeah. Um, Melanie, could you get Juana water? Okay, yes to one. No to two and three. Red meat is good for you. Cervical bruising is good for you. Exactly in that order. Hi, girls. Send it back to me by the 15th. What the fuck? ...certain sectors, we're definitely gonna... He is, isn't he? Handsome. Wow, such a long drive. I wish you lived in L.A. Oh, no, thank you. We only leave old Mexico these days to buy clothes or, like... What do you mean, "leave Mexico"? You're in Mjico. Whatever, dude. No, not Mjico. This here is Mexico. Okay, I don't get your jokes. What's "Mexico"? Mexico is a huge crowded nation a couple hundred miles that way. Mexico... is an independent crypto-micro-nation... surrounded on all sides by the USA. And you're in it. But it's true, though. That's what people in town have called our family's land - for a hundred years. - Really? The whole town calls it that. That's fucked up. How long have you been standing there? Just got here. Don't you start at 9:00? Uh, not on days when your dad has me on night watch. Uh, this came for you. Is it from Hong Kong? I don't know. Hey, you want juice? He isn't gonna touch it. Uh, yeah. O-Okay. Oh, no. Baby, no, no, not... not bottled water. Bring her a tall glass. Yeah, it's fine. Okay? No, it's okay. Go on. Thanks. "Why do you have a thermometer behind your ear? "Fuck. Fuck. Some asshole has my pencil." Is this expensive wine? You bet. How long you worked here? 35 years. - Jesus. - Jesus what? - Nothing. - How long have you worked here? A week. That's right. This is a much better job than it looks like. Don't assume I haven't had more glamorous opportunities. I didn't. Ah... I could have trained sled dogs. Iditarod. Okay. I had this one dog, fast as hell. Just don't judge my life again until you've figured it. Figured what? What's far from fucking normal about this place, the family. What's that mean? Ah, you'll know it when you know it, if you don't quit. Need help with anything? No. How long you lived here? Where? Here. Wherever. In Winfield. In the county. Oh, yeah, I live in town. For how long? About a month. Work for the Mexicans, right? What is this? Just trying to help you find everything you need. I work for the Arista family. The Aristas. Good customers. Okay, boys, back to work. Yeah, we'll get back to work. Have fun at the Arista place. Don't drink the water. Whatever, man. Why are you both so bad? Because we're just bad. Because we lack maturity. You do, anyway. I admit it. Can't do anything about it. The thing about being immature is that you can't suddenly decide that you want to be mature. It's already mature to want to be mature. Mm, speak for yourself. Why don't you tell me one of your theories, brujita? - Ah, don't call her that. - Why not? Only Papa calls her that. Look, a double bubble. Just my education didn't go to waste. Don't worry about that. Give us a theory. I like a theory with my tea. Really? But it's so nice out. Tell us a theory. Well, in the future, people will pay to have the Internet plastered with slander about them, false addresses, duplicate profiles, fake news, fake nudes, fake passwords, sex with their faces plastered onto actors' bodies. This will be the new privacy... anonymity within the overload. Personal data will be safe again once it's buried under an avalanche of fake embarrassments. That's not a bad idea. We're just not even close yet, though. But once there's multiple fake sex tapes of every human being on social media, then the release of a real sex tape will be harmless. That'll be sad. I like real sex tapes. What about you, brujita? What's your nasty habit this week? Uh... being sad, but looking happy. In Tokyo, I had a painless hard mass with irregular edges... in my left breast. - Really? - Really? Disappeared entirely the few days I've been home. Well, that's good. Fuck, man, these are heavy. - Yep. - They're complaining. They can complain in town until they're tired of complaining. This is how it is right now. I don't care... What's in these? Bricks? Don't know. Bullshit, you don't. Shit. Wine, maybe? Fuck, man. - She just wants to know... - Okay. Come back after it rains if she wants that. Tell her, for now, it's the same as it always is. - I'll count this in the house. - Okay. What'd I say? Uh... Shit. Mm. Oh. Oh, excuse me. ...fireball. That's right. He's with you. He's with us. He knows your life ain't no less important than theirs. He knows that the real purpose there is to make the honest, working citizens of our country look like fools. They did it with the new oil pipeline in the Dakotas... Hey, sorry about that, man. I, uh... No harm done. Thanks. You work in Mexico? Yeah. Good pay? Not bad. They let you drink the water? Man, is that some sort of, like, local racist joke or... You calling me a racist? Man... It's okay. Everyone's racist subconsciously. Read that in "The New York Times." Where's my straw? What the fuck? Hey. No, no, no, no, no. - I'm mad at you. - What the fuck? The guy can walk me. I don't want you waking Papa up. He says you're a symptom of imperial decline. "Symptom" what? Imperial decline! W-Walk me to the house. Hey. Hey. How strong are you? I don't know. Strong. Good. My feet hurt so badly, I can barely walk. Oh. Don't let dirt get on my dress. Pick me up. What, like carry you? The house is all the way over... way down there. Fucking piggyback. Get down. Yeah, okay. You smell good. James Dean's asleep in my barn. He's my pony. - Right. - Mm-hmm. Hey! Shit. Sorry. I hurt you? Don't bump your vertebrae into my pussy. What the fuck? How can you... Shh. Damn. Don't wake your dad up. Hey, stop. No, if you don't stop, I'm gonna put you down. If you put me down, I'll tell my papa that you slammed yourself into my pussy. What the fuck, dude? You're touching it right now with your back! Shh. Stop. What the fuck? I'm gonna put you down, okay? Don't test me, Don. Fuck, man. Fucking coke brain. Mm. Carry me to the house. That's what I'm doing. Also, right now, you're touching my pussy with your spine, but, like, that's socially acceptable until I mention it. And also people carry shit around in their intestines, so you're, like, always, like, like, like, a foot away from someone else's shit. Then it's... But, like, That's cool until you mention it. Mm. Put me down on the steps. That's what I'm doing. This is a good system for when I come home from L.A. at 6 A.M. and my feet hurt so bad. Ah, good night, Tania. You like that? Ow. Yeah, that's good. Uh, you wanted to see me? - Yes. Um... - Okay. Yes. This is a matter of some delicacy. Okay. Well, Don, um... we'd like to ask you about the well and the pump system. The well? Oh, yeah. What did you think we wanted to see you about? I don't know. Have you been using well water for yard work? No. Mike told me to use the county water from the spigot for the lawns and pools and groves. That's right. Mm-hmm. - Okay. Well, have you seen Mike or Melanie use the well taps or the girls' fountain for... I don't know. Filling containers? The well taps are the ones you use in the master bedroom for drinking and in the kitchen? That's right. Then maybe talk to Melanie if it's a kitchen problem. You do know, though, that we keep our water separate here. We only drink well water, and we use county water for everything else? Yeah. Yeah, uh, Mike explained it when... when he hired me. Fine. Well, the, uh... - The well... - the well is low. Do you want me to go down inside it? I'm not claustrophobic. I've done, uh, crawlspace work before. I did plumbing back in Florida. Oh, no. That's fine. W-We're sorry that we bothered you. Yeah. Um... - Okay. - But listen. Uh, for the next couple of weeks, instead of just walking around all the acres at night... Mm-hmm. why not just camp out by the well. - But out of sight. - Yes. Y-You want me to hide in the bushes? Uh, there's the big tree with the vultures' nest. Sure, but take a lawn chair so you're comfortable and a dark blanket. Yes, absolutely. We want you to be comfortable. Mm-hmm. But not obvious. I'm gonna get back on untangling Tania's necklaces. Okay. Thank you, Don. We really appreciate it. He doesn't know a thing. No, I agree. ...and then you're there for some reason, but you're eating virtual vomit off the floor. And you don't want to eat too much vomit, 'cause you're on a diet, but it just tastes so real, so... And, luckily for me, you've already eaten it 9,999 times, so there's barely any vomit left. No, that's not how simulations work. The vomit would obviously reset. Your simulations always lack a basic logical consistency. Oh, mine do? Yours are idiotic. If you think about it, it's the people with the preexisting conditions that are the people that cost the most. Are you listening to me? Yeah. Don't you care about politics? I don't know. Did you vote? Yeah. You've known those girls since they were little kids? Sorry to say. You don't like them? I've known them since they were in diapers. They don't even know my name. They know your name. They're godless, arrogant, sick-minded brats who waste a lot of electricity and water, but I like my job. They're nice to me. For a minute. Cleaning a barbecue. You're a boring kid, Don. Educate yourself. Fuck you, man. Where are you from, anyway? Florida. Then what's with this Oklahoma horseshit? What? Why do you dress like that? What's wrong with this? Go read a book. You go read a book. I dress the same as you. Fine distinctions. Get a library card. Man, why don't you go get a library... Agh. Ow! - Fuck. - Get a what? Go get a couple beers tonight? - Are you buying? - Yeah. Just don't ever kick me in the ass again. I'm not neurotic, per se. I'd say that you're more neurotic. Neurosis is no longer in the DSM, though. It's an extinct condition. But we're definitely cut off from something. We are. Look at the groundskeepers. Those guys enjoy a solid, authentic, working-class environment that we could never understand. Who were you impersonating? I don't know. The media. Mm, Tanita has a theory about the media. I don't have a theory. You have all the theories. - Switchy? - No. I'm not in the mood. Oh, come on. Come on. Switchy. Expand my theory, genius. Okay, fine. Go. Middle-class people think working-class people are... "salt of the earth," more real, more authentic, but this is really condesation... cond... condescension masquerading as... esteem. Not to mention, the world presented to us by our perceptions is not... reality, per se. To get anywhere close to... "authentic reality" means pushing at the boundaries of... neuroscience and fundamental physics. Careers in these fields typically require a privileged childhood and hundreds of thousands of tuition dollars. Conclusion... the world is authentically unfair and fucked up. Nice half-ton. New? Ah, I had it since December. Then why do you drive that piece of shit to work every day? So Henry and Monica don't think I don't need a raise. Are they not home? They went to Turks and Caicos, left early this morning. Turk's and who? Some islands in the Caribbean. Hey, did the girls go with 'em? No. Then, you don't care if the girls see your truck? No. I told you I'm invisible to them. Hey, could I get a... You know, your door's just open. Is it cold out there? Um, you know, I'm only 28. I'm only 36. What? No, you're not. You wanna see my passport? I just mean that, you know, I'm not that much older than you, and I like to party. Oh, yeah? You "like to party?" Ah, fuck you. Come on. Aren't you on the clock? Are you gonna tell your dad? You can come in if you do four lines in a row. Four? How 'bout one? Four! Hey, I'll do four if you stop making that noise. Ah, I already told you that one. You have to do two more. No, I did... I did the... No, no, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do it. Do it. Social contract, motherfucker. You agreed to four lines. 1, 2, 3, 4. Go, go, go, go. What? A Jew taught me that one. Shouldn't you be guarding the well? Man, I'm out there all night every night. Just I don't see nothing but fucking raccoons. Come on. Snort, pig, snort. Snort, pig, snort. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Mother. Henry, what are we doing here? Everyone... Henry, I worked here since... I know. I know this is demeaning. Uh, I just need to talk to everyone at once. Hey. It's not a police lineup. I just need everyone's attention. Okay. The well's at 30%. Last week, when we left, it was at 67%. - 30%? - That's right. And when will it replenish? When it rains. But does the rainwater immediately... - Shh! - So you think someone went in there and pumped all that water out without any of us seeing that? No small operation to drain a well. We just want to know if anyone has seen anything. - No. - No, Mama. No. I want you to install CCTV. Okay. No, this is a serious situation. Don. - Don. - Yeah? You've been watching the well? Yeah. All night? Yeah. Each night? Yeah. You don't sleep? Oh, I... I sleep at home, 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. Ah, changing of the guard. I liked your other truck. Boss is back. So's the beater. Mike. What? I'm late for dinner. What's the deal with the water? Henry and Monica are freaks about it. People in town are freaks about it. Ah... Now the girls are acting weird about it. Come on. What? Tell me what the fuck is going on. I-I'm gonna fuck something up and get fired if I don't know what's going on. Eh, the Aristas think their well water is healthier than other water. Certain other people think so, too. What, like spring water? Like mineral water? Sure. That's it? They sell it. I-It has a flavor, too, unusual, like... Ah, I can't describe it. I only tasted it the one time 10 years ago. Oh, so that's what's with the cases and the vans. You catch on slow. I mean, like, why all the security if it's just mineral water? Do they have their own brand of mineral water in the stores? No. Go guard the well. This job sucks. You asked for it. Wasn't night watch when I signed up. Evolve or die. - Hey, Mike. - What? What? Mm, you believe in evolution? Hell, no. It ain't the ghost If it don't speak in tongues. It's not a victory 'Til the battle's been won Something like mass destruction, fucking... Ah ah Hey. Yes? You guys not partying tonight? It's Friday. No. No party here. Just, you know... you know, last week, you guys and I... and it was cool, you know? - Just... - Hmm. Is Tania here? Yes. It's... I'm sorry. A-Are we not... we not friends anymore? 'Cause, you know, like, um... what happened to last week? Very strange question. Right. Uh, it's just... Okay, do you want to see her? Yeah, all right. - Hey. - Hi, Don. Hey. Hi, Tania. What's the problem? Ah, your sister's just being weird. I-I mean, you know, just she needs help remembering that we partied last week. Hey, you should go watch the well. Y-Yeah. I mean... that's what I was doing. Was... She's right. Yeah. Hey, why you guys treating me like I'm the... fucking hired help? Did I do something? I mean, you licked my mouth. I lick all kinds of things. She's like a dog. James, meet Don. Don, meet James. Okay, you should go do your job. We're all really upset about the water level. Good night. Yeah, good night. Yeah. Look at that. Push it. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Who the fuck's that? Is that a gun? I think so. Oh, shit. That is a gun. - Go! Go! - Wait. Hey! Hey! What the fuck? Fuck sake. Hey! Hey! No! What the fuck? Shit. Hey! Pussies! Ow motherfuck! Holy shit. You okay? I'm 71 years old. That's all. 71? Yes. You know, Don here can identify one of them. You can fingerprint those tanks to get the other two. We don't do that for misdemeanors. Except this isn't a misdemeanor. The well's at 29%, despite the rains, so this is grand larceny on top of trespassing. Well, trespassing is a misdemeanor, unless you live in Colorado or, I think, New Hampshire, if it's multiple trespasses. This is multiple. It takes months to drain a well three backpacks... Like I said, that's just New Hampshire. So what are you gonna do? What's going on here? Well, you come down to the station in the morning, file a report, and we'll do all we can. And you're gonna check the hospitals for buckshot wounds? You know, shooting a trespasser is a felony in all 50 states. Texas? Right, Texas. Not sure about Texas. Bad Papa. Did you shoot someone? Let's restart this. You and your colleagues down at the station know exactly what's going on here, so let's stop pretending this is a misdemeanor. I'm not pretending anything. Trespassing is a misdemeanor. Stealing water, this amount, first offense, $25 to $250 fine... Please stop playing games. I'll lose my temper. You lose your temper, and I'll arrest you right now for assault with a shotgun. So get some rest, and, uh, come on down in the morning. How dare you treat my father - with such disrespect. - Miss... You Bolsheviks think everyone in town should share our water until it's gone, don't you? Doesn't really matter what I think. But sharing's always nice. They taught me that in nursery school. Good luck asking them to police themselves. Why should they? Nothing in it for them. Honey, they have all kinds of problems, meth labs, illiteracy. It's evident what needs to be done. How old is that fucking thing... There we go. There goes our view. Of course, this is the logical eventuality of the current pattern. Wealthier nations will get wealthier, live longer, build walls. Yes, well, it's ugly, but what are you gonna do? Let 'em all come in and drain us dry? Didn't get paid enough? Don't just bang away like a monkey. If you have to wear a shirt under the thing, c-can you unbutton it? No, thanks. Open! I want nipples in the photos! At least give me a slash of flesh down the middle for contrast. Can you take the mask off, brujita? Absolutely not. Oh, come on. Why not? Same reason as before. What reason is that? I don't want my face in photos on the Internet until you are a world-class fashion photographer. How could I become one if you don't let me build my portfolio? Take pictures. Here. You're too curvy, anyway. Just shoot me like you'd shoot a man. How does that make any sense? All solutions are counterintuitive this late in the story. But I'm not going for that. I'm going for a kind of Lilith in Eden type of thing, and your mask is fucking it up! The cyborg does not recognize the Garden of Eden. That mask makes you a cyborg? Actually the ubiquity and invisibility of machines in everyday life make me a cyborg. That's great, brujita. Malfunction. Malfunction. Malfunction. Malfunction. Malfunction. Malfunction. Malfunction. Malfun... Aren't you on night watch? Worked on the wall all day. I can't work all day and all night. When you gonna automate this gate? Mike's gonna do it soon. What? Do you want to party with us tonight? I thought I was just the hired help. Thought you don't talk to me anymore. The help needs recreation, too. Where's your car? Did you walk all the way here? Some assholes left me on the road up there. Who? The cokehead guy? No, he's in Rio. That's in Brazil. Just local losers. But didn't I see you take your car out earlier? Some gringitospushed it into a red zone, and then it got towed while I was in town, and then some other gringos, they offered me a ride, but then they left me on the county road. What the fuck? Yep. So do you wanna come to the playhouse or not? Um... sure. Just... Just let me hide my truck outside the ranch. Change my shirt. So, uh, what are we celebrating? We aren't. You shouldn't think about champagne that way. It's not fair to champagne. You know, I-I like how you guys made this place, like, crazy. Yeah, it was our playhouse when we were little babies. Then we had Mike convert it to a habitat when we developed breasts. Ugh. What is that? Cocana negra. Are you addicted? Hello, Don. You kinda say my name weird when you say it. - "Weirdly." - What? So we're doing drugs with Don. Is that... Is that tonight's event? We have too much. Our culture is turning inwards and devouring itself. We need fresh blood! Actually, you were wrong. I found them exactly where I said they were. Now let me see. The... The problem is the World Economic Forum ranks us 48th in math and science education. It doesn't matter if you're intelligent if you're not likeable. Give me the other ones. Do it on her. Do it, Don. Yeah. Open your mouth. Open. - Ucch. - Yeah. We know no one person can succeed unless everyone else succeeds. Right? Right? Say something, Don. Say something hilarious. Say something not hilarious. That would be hilarious. It's more humorous to be not humorous. What... What do I do? Say something hilarious. What should I say? - Say something not funny. - Say something. - Just... Just don't look at me. - What do you want me to say? - Say something hilarious. - Come on, Don. Come on, Don. Come on, Don. - Do something. Do something. - Do something. - What should I do? - Just do something funny. - What should I do? - Do shit, fucker. - Come on, Don. - Speak, Koko. Speak. - What do you... - Speak! - Koko, speak! - Come on, Don. - Speak, Koko! Speak! - Rowwr! Do something! There is a God-shaped hole in the heart of every man. Amen. I admire your family so much, you know? It's like your mom and your dad, they're both just kinda perfect. A-And they have just great style, like clothes. And... And you all have great vocabularies. You want to dress like Papa? No. I'm just... Let's go get some of Papa's clothes for Don. No. No, I just mean that... I just... I like how you... how you live. Here is just... it's like a dream. The American dream. The myth of paradise on the other side. Ooh. Caligula wasn't the only good emperor. "American dream." Mm. How about another spoonful, Donny Donny? No, no. I'm not immune to it like you. Oh, don't be so tedious. - What the fu... - Do a spoonful! What's in it that makes it fucking black? Irony. What, like rust? Oh, poor baby doesn't wanna do another spoon. Nah. You two are freaks. Oh, he wants his mommy. He's scared. My mom died when I was 17. Ohh. He misses his mommy. He wants his milkies. What the fuck? Mm. Here we go. Oh, his mommy died. Poor baby. He wants his milkies. Don't do that! You don't... make fun of my mother's death. Come drink, poor baby. Fuck. Shit, you two are freaks. You just said that. But saying the same thing twice is not inherently a waste of breath. Come drink, poor baby. Why do you want me to... Same speech act performed a second time can radically reorient the context of both acts. Good baby. Good baby. I'm tired. I'm drunk. I was conceived in a test tube. Mmm. Good baby. Good baby. Good baby. That's a good baby. Good baby. You can fuck me if... brujitawatches. Who's brujita? My other baby. You serious? Are you really going to neglect your opportunities in life when you have so few? You're serious. Don't. Don't touch. What is sexual objectification? How does it function today in our particular moment when labor gives way to robotics, sex itself gives way to genetic engineering, bourgeois realism gives way to science fiction? Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Wh-What are you doing? Go. You, too? No, I'm merely helping. Okay. Looks like you're more than helping. Well, she's my little sister. She needs help with everything. Yeah, with this, too... Okay, step out. Oh, man. Just one second. I'm going to put this on you. - Please hold still. - Okay. Okay. You're a robot. Fuck her like a robot. - What? - Remember, science fiction. Ooh. Don't be a bourgeois realist, not in bed, at least. Don't look at her. Look at me. Sorry. You're both so hot. - Go faster. - Okay. You're an artificial life form. Except you're an early prototype... - Faster! - so you malfunction a lot. No, just don't listen to her! Machinery has adapted to the weakness of the human being so that the weak human being will become a machine. Faster! Faster! Ugh. Ow. Ohh. Get off me. Get off. Fuck. Ohh. Ohh. Hey. Where are you going? To the shower to use her shower-head, because her robot malfunctioned. I've learned that love is not a feeling And I've learned that all my heroes bleed Where is she? How many protestors are there? See for yourself. Mr. Arista, please take your guns back into your house. There's no law that says I can't carry a licensed weapon on my own land. This is not about any laws. This is not Winfield city limits. I have no authority here whatsoever. What exactly are they protesting? People feel that you've charged extortionary prices for your water for years, and now I understand that you've stopped providing it entirely. That's right. People also feel that this wall is antiprogressive and presents a message of superiority and lack of common decency. No, trespassing and theft have left us no choice. So, if we no longer desire to share or sell our water, there's nothing anyone can do about it. But we all know that the relationship between your family and the town is old and far from simple. Look, you employ citizens of Winfield, as did your father a-and his. People have been buying water from your family for generations. I drink your water. There are dozens of artesian sources in these hills. Why don't you just have the county drill more wells for public use? I think you know quite well why people want your water. I'd like to hear you say it out loud so we can all agree how farcical this is. I think you know exactly what the local superstition is and why people are legitimately concerned. You see, here we have a contradiction. You can't have a legitimate concern governed by superstition. I want you to say it out loud, and I want to know why you don't have any police down here. Look, just take the guns back into your house. As far as I can tell, these guns are why those illiterates over there are still over there and not overrunning our land. - No more wall! - No more wall! - No more wall! - ...wall! This wall is for them. Without it, pretty soon, there's no well water for them or anyone else. So maybe, if I get them to leave, you'll start selling the water again. For now, no. We're running very low because of thieves from Winfield, some of them probably right over there. - You can't... - No more wall! No more wall! They just crossed on our private property. I'm gonna start shooting feet. You should probably scram. I'll help build this fucker, but I won't defend it. You should follow my lead if you want to keep living in town. You might want to cover your ears. The report from a shotgun can cause tinnitus. This is no longer safe. It's okay. I can handle it. Mr. Arista, please, I'm begging you, be civilized. ...calling Winfield police... Stop! - ...on County Road 11. - No more wall! - No more wall! - No more wall! Hey, don't leave. - Hey, guys, no more wall. - Hey. No more wall! - They have 60 seconds. - You better listen to him. He really means it when he starts counting. - 55, 54... - Yes, sir. 53... Don. - 52... - Guys, guys, - stop. Stop. - 51... You guys calm... 50, 49... 48... 47, 46... 45, 44... 43, 42... 41... Hey, fuck you, Enrique! Go back, and fuck your daughters! There's nothing inherently wrong with it if you use contraception. All right. Gotta go back and make some calls. Make sure they all leave. Here. Help out Don. Guns are so outdated. And, uh, see if you can pick up a conducted electrical weapon. A what? A stun gun. Just trust me. Just... Just leave. He's not... You were joking, right? What, the incest thing? For me, there's no attraction. Tanita might do it if Papa would. He wouldn't, though. - We'll be back! - Right. Fuck you! What an anticlimax. One gunshot, and they all go back to their cars. Then again, most uprisings in history end in anticlimax. We just only hear about the ones that don't. Hey. Now's not a good time, okay? Who says, you or Tania? "You or Tania?" "You or Tania?" "You or Tania?" Just leaving, man. Just leaving. I don't speak Spanish, man. Just let me talk to her. Please go guard the property. Those protestors might come back. Come on. Not tonight, okay? - Hey... - Not tonight. Yeah. Yeah, I guess tonight's a bad night for me to not do my job. There you go. Good night. Yeah. Yeah. What? Raccoons. I'm so depressed. That's addiction, Tanita. Your brain needs more and more stimulation to feel content. But I am so, so sad. Mm-hmm. Sad. Not sad. Sad. Not sad. Sad. Not sad. - Sad. - Mm, stop it. - Stop it. - Not sad. Well, I'm sad, too. Papa's wall is not working. The other night, I was driving back from Vegas. Mm-hmm. I put on your echoey piano playlist. Mm-hmm. And there was a silent ambulance ahead... for, like, 50 minutes with its light on, but the highway was empty. And that made you sad? No. It made me the thing before sad that there isn't a name for. The foyer of sad. The cloakroom of sad. The House of Saud. The House of Saud. S-Saud. - Stop it. - Saud. Stop saying that. It's a nice paradox how human sadness is no less common the more the population is protected from things like war and starvation and disease and exploitation... Are you listening to me? Yes, Tania, I'm listening to you. Okay. Let me finish. Okay, go. Okay. So, with an ambulance, there's supposed to be a siren, right? Mm. So the lack of that did something wrong to me. Or to time. And I felt like I was an echo... being dragged for so long behind a silent ambulance. I felt certain that I was in the future, dying in it. Dying in the ambulance or dying in the future? Both. Seem more dead. Your manikin is tired and cold. Just hold still a few years. Global warming. You'll be fine. Maybe that's why the well's dropping still. Maybe nobody's stealing much from it at all. Do you think everyone here who isn't poor will have to move somewhere north in, like, 30 years? Not 30, no. Papa bought land in Alaska. Really? When? Last year. I couldn't live anywhere but here. That'll keep the claim jumpers out. Be here when the world ends. She's been driving up the price per gallon, too. Henry says the well's still dropping, though. Henry's pissed. Ah, let him be. It's good for him. Yeah. What's wrong with you? You're even poorer company than your usual worthless self. You can tell me, you dumb kid. Huh? Ah... The girls won't talk to me. Peanut brain. What did I tell you about that? Yeah, but... You wanna get laid off? You wanna get laid or laid off? What's wrong with your simple head? Yeah, but I already got laid. Bullshit on a hill of shit. Whatever. I did, though. Which one? Both, kinda. I-I guess just Tania. Nah. Whatever you want to believe, man. Magic, aliens, Jesus Christ, Fountain of Youth. You name it, I believe in it. Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! - Traitor. - ...call me? - I worked for your grandfather. - Traitor. Traitor. I heard you filling it up. - What were you doing... - What's going on? Fixing the enamel on your mother's goddamn vanity. Oh, with a jug of water? With a jug of whatever I want. What's going on? He's probably been selling it in town for years. - What's the trouble here? - Well, the mystery is solved. He's why the wall isn't keeping the well full. - Right. - Oh, and he controls the CCTV computer, and he's probably been working with those thieves. That's libel. Laws against accusing people of things like that. Let me taste it, Michael. No, I won't. I won't stoop myself to it. "Stoop myself"? Who says, "Stoop myself"? Michael, you have nothing to hide, so let me just taste the water, and my daughters will apologize. I'm going home. Not until I taste that water. No, I won't dignify it. Well... then, we'll have to let you go. You're fucking crazy. - I knew he had more money than... - You're all cabin fever wacko. It's very simple to solve this. Hey, Mike, just let him taste it. - Don, please. - You can taste my ass. - Michael. - I won't do it. Then, we'll have to let you go. You hypocrite. You ruined your children, you know? Your daughters are wolves, not people. Oh, I like that. Scorpions would have been more poetic. No, I don't like scorpions. - Piranhas, I like... - Stop. Okay. I can see we've finished our arrangement. Put the jug down, and go home, and I'll have somebody drop off your belongings and a check for this and next month's pay. Hope your well dries up, you all get colon cancer, something awful. Put the jug down. Fuck you. I'll use it to pay for a lawyer. I'm 'a go talk to him, - if you want. - No. No, thanks. It's okay. Please, just make sure he leaves the property. And change the gate code. Okay. - Hey. - Get off of me. Does Henry know you have this many horses? Hell, no. I'll talk to them again tomorrow. - They don't want... - They don't want what? And why does Henry have you over here already with my fuckin' check? They're nuttier than squirrel shit, all four of 'em. So is the water, I mean... I mean, what's the... You haven't tried it yet? Nope. Man, you're an honest little dope. Hey, you know, I'm starting my own contracting company. Why don't you come work for me? You pay as good as Henry? Twice as much respect. Rather have some money. Ah, you're just head over ass for those two putas, aren't you? Nah. They won't even talk to me anymore. Told you. Someone should kidnap 'em both and sell 'em into human trafficking. Fuck Henry. I ought to dynamite that wall. Hell'll break loose soon enough. Townies'll be back. Something'll snap. Me. Maybe you. Me? Yeah. You know... everything's got a breaking point. People, can't treat people like they do. Not me. Um, so, uh... were you? - What? - Stealing? The magic water? "Magic water." Such a dopey kid. Well, were you? Mm, maybe. I mean, yes. How the hell else am I supposed to feed my kids, my horses a red pussy hair above the minimum wage? I've seen that. No benefits and... Seen what? Red. Jesus. You don't know the first thing about women, money, politics... sky being blue... what kind of boots to put on in the morning. Fuck you, man. What kind of boots am I supposed to? This kind. Gotcha. What? I'm only tasting it. I just wanted to see what the big deal was. Don't tell your parents. Hey. Hey. Wh-What the fuck? What'd I ever do to you? Stop walking! Don't be a fucking bitch, okay? Hey! Stop walking. Tania! Tania! Hey, I-I'll tell your dad you snort that fucked-up black cocaine! Look, I know. I'm sorry, okay? I am sorry. It was just a small sip. I was just curious, what with firing Mike a-and the wall and all. I've spoken to my husband, and I've spoken to my daughters. We've decided, as a family, to hire some new staff. Monica, please. I need this job. You can't just fire everyone... It's been decided. What? All I did is just take one little sip of water. I just wanted to know what the big deal was. You're so rich, you can't afford just one little sip of water? It's not about the water. Then what is it, then? It's your conduct towards my daughters. What? They told me about your unwelcome advances. Unwelcome adv... Are you serious? Very much so. Ah. Okay. Yeah, all right. Okay, excuse me. Bullshit. Calm down, please. We're... We're happy to extend some severance pay for you. We're very happy to do that. It was the water. It wasn't the water. Hmm? You could fire me if you want, but at least be honest about it. It's not your daughters. It's the fucking water. I'm going to go get Henry. Henry can explain this to you. You know, your cokehead daughters practically begged me to have sex with them, and then I just take one small sip, and... And you, you can't treat people the way you do! Stop walking! I'll do something! Stop walking! I'll do something! Stop walking! I will do something! Stop! Wait! No! No! What are you doing?! Stop! What are you doing?! - No! - Stop! Stop! Oh, my God. No, no, no. No, no. Looking at you in the cold morning light Looking so pale, and cheeks so, so white I never intended To kill you last night I know about Willie And what you have done Oh, Emily, I believed I was the only one Today and forever You ain't seeing... What does it say? It says that my clients agree not to get the police involved in any way, not to press charges for attempted murder. - Hmm? - It also says that you agree that you asked Henry Arista to stun-gun you, and, when he did... - Is your dad coming? - No. - Tania? - No. It also says that he asked you to pour insecticide into his well as a part of an elaborate game involving theatrical elements. What? It means that you'll never go to jail for attempted murder of my whole family. Just read it all the way to the bottom, and sign. Attempted murder? Who did... Who did I attempt to murder? The Arista family. You premeditatedly poisoned their drinking water. But it says right there that they agree you did no such thing. What's "premeditatedly"? That you planned it. Oh. I didn't plan anything. I just was freaking out, just... I didn't mean to ruin anything. Your family's so great. You did, however, so will you sign it, please? I just wanted a little drink of water. I just wanted to be part of everything. Just, uh, read it, and sign. Are you all gonna get old now? It was always only a wishing well. What does that mean? There's no such thing as paradise. Then how do you all look so young, then? Money, dermal fillers, plastic surgery. So I-I didn't ruin your family, then? You don't have the power to ruin my family. Why'd we build a wall, then? We built a wall around a myth. Most myths are toxic, anyway. You merely added real poison. No. I don't believe you. Nobody looks like you do at your age. You don't believe me? No. Hey, I'm not an idiot. I know the water makes you not get old. Does it? Well, it probably gives you cancer now, thanks to you and your stupidity. - Ximena. - My stupidity. - Good. I'm glad. I'm glad. - Ximena. You know, you don't deserve to not get old. You almost have my sympathy. You're... You're like a dog. Ximena, can we get back to... Okay, let me explain the 21st century to you. My family has investments, real estate, bitcoin, commodity futures, catastrophe bonds, um... As the world gets hotter and more populated and less educated, we will be able to afford whatever unfair technologies continue to divide the wealthy from the poor. Our children, if we have any, will be safer and taller and smarter than your children. We will have well passed 100, with or without well water. You're evil. In a binary world of black and white distinctions, yes, yes, I guess I am. Somebody should kill you. Are you threatening my client? - No, competition... - No. and self-interest, yes, yes, probably somebody should. You know, if they could get past my wall. You're evil. I'm just telling you the truth. I'm not condoning it or celebrating it. Enough. Let's get this done. I hope somebody kills you. I hope someone offers you a glass of water from a magic well that grants not longevity, but the capacity to fathom irony and complex, insoluble zero-sum problems. I hope somebody kills you. Saying the same thing twice is not inherently a waste of breath.
