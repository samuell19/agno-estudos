Please try... warning. Security breach, main bridge. Security breach... Forget it, Captain. Jesus, Lieutenant, don't do this. The least you can do is congratulate me. I'm getting married. Wait a minute, remember the first time we all saw here. For God's sake, man, don't you remember what we all said? It's my fiancee you're talking about, asshole. Borman, I'm giving you a direct order. Fuck you, old man. Not having your best day, are you, Captain? Borman, eight. Crew, zip. You're mine. Jesus, Lieutenant, in God's name, don't do this. Ariel? Ariel? Got a light, fly boy? Come on, sport. Give your fiance a light. You know, all this sizzle and burn is making me hot. You, uh, you feeling horny, Borman, baby? Oh my God. Kind of makes you want to hit the sack, doesn't it? I mean, that is what you're all about, isn't it? Who are you? The future Mrs. Borman. Oh, come on, sport. There's no need to be so melodramatic. Earth, 2022 AD, maximum security prison, New Alcatraz. Shit, DJ. I'll teach you for cheating Let me in. Mancuso, Nick, navigator first class. What's he in for? Mutiny. Mutiny, huh? He was the ringleader, almost pulled it off too. You had a problem with the captain of your vessel? Yeah, I had a problem. He went fucking bananas. What kind of navigator is he? Rated in the top one percentile at the Annapolis Space Academy. You still want him? Yeah, I still want him. Shit. Damn, DJ. What is that? Top clearance on all system three programs. A real computer jock. He's as good as they get. What kind of time are you doing, DJ? Life without parole. Somehow he managed to penetrate the military budget requisition computers inside Mount Thunder. They picked him up inside a bank in Zurich. He was withdrawing $500,000 from his new Swiss account. How much does he have in his account? $20 million American. He'll do. God damn it, DJ. Peter McClellan, engineer first grade. Life no parole, drunk driving. Wiped out an entire family on the Autobahn outside Houston. A booze hound, huh? He's been sober for three years. Isn't that right, McClellan? Hey, what's all this about? Just answer the question, McClellan. Yeah, right, three years. Bring him in. Oh, shit. Go ahead. I fucking die outside. I die inside. What the fuck difference does it make? Crane, Lloyd, demolitions expert. Blew an armored car, took out a pizza joint along with it, five dead. You like to blow things, huh? Not as much as I like to fuck. I bet you like to do that a lot. Well, what do you want? I got a dick with a will of iron. What did you use to blow the armored truck? Plastique. I'd say you used too much. Well, welcome back, Lloyd. Thanks, DJ. Nice map you gave me. It sucked. If you could read, you Neanderthal, I got you outside, didn't I? Yeah, me and any 15 other guards. What did you do, sell them the map too? How do you think I got my laptop? I'm looking for a few good men. Four assholes doing life. That's the point, Mancuso. Flat out. None of you have much of an option on your future. As it stands now, each one of you is going to die in this hellhole. If you volunteer for this mission, you roll the dice, you hit your number, you're free men when we get back. And we roll snake eyes? You die a million miles away from home. Well, hell, ain't that like walking into a whorehouse with the lights out? I told you all you're going to know. A rescue mission? That's not much. Yeah. I'd like some input here. OK. There's a freighter running dark. We're going to go up there, hook her up, and tow her home. That's it? That's all you're going to tell us? It's need to know, or back to your cells. You're a gambler, aren't you, Mancuso? According to your dossier, you like the cards. You play the right hand, and you're a free man in eight months. And if I don't? Your cell's waiting for you, plus a couple of new cellmates. You guys got all the cards, don't you? Well, I tell you what, I've wound up with a lot of dogs in those dark rooms. Uh-uhn. I'll take my chances back in the stir. There's one more thing. The Aphrodite Program. What the hell are you talking about? He's talking about virtual reality. It's called The Weekend. You choose your woman, your fantasy. Friday nights at 5 o'clock you all have the weekend off. Our own private programs? You choose your poison. We choose the broads, huh? It's your weekend. Well, hot fucking damn. Vessel, USS Presley, Class E salvage vehicle. Crew, five man, one positronic android, Model 4. Mission time, three months into deep space. So then I hopped the barbed wire and I gutted the guard. Hey, pay attention. So then I gutted the guard. I grabbed his Luger and... I freed half the POWs in that camp. Why only half the POWs, Lloyd? Because, digit head, I knew the weekend was nearly over, and I still had to rendezvous with my Fraulein in the beer garden in Berlin. So what did you do, brainiac? Fix Al Capone's tax returns? Or did you slide your bookmark into Marian the librarian? For your information, Captain Marvelous, I was at the Kremlin naked in bed sipping a cold vodka with a Russian double agent snuggled up next to me. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Hm. Male or female? Hey, fuck you, Lloyd. Attention all crew members, weekend will commence at 1700 hours. Yee-haw. In about a half hour, I'm gonna be heading to the wild, wild west, where we'll do some shooters humping and grinding in the saddle, boy. Well you better be careful, Lloyd. Even though this is a fantasy, farm animals still carry disease. I knew that. Good. Hey, this is bullshit. Peter and Nick are already in their pods. They must have quit early. We should get extra time just for that. Quit your bitching. Get in your pod. Where are you going? I'm going to 1952. Yeah? Well, I'm going to the wild, wild west. See you later, cowboy. Yee-haw. Well, hot fucking damn. That feel good, Lloyd? Oh, it sure does, Amy. I ordered you the biggest steak in the house. Well, big steaks take a long time to cook, don't they? Oh. They sure do. Tarnation, Lloyd, you're some kind of mule, ain't you? Yeah. You ought to knock before you barge in on a man with a loaded gun. Now, darling, I brought you a big old piece of meat here. Looks like you already got one. Oh, did you hear? Frank Strange and his gang are coming into town on the noon train. Enjoy your meat. Frank Strange. Frank Strange, didn't you hear? Yep. I put that varmint in Leavenworth. But, oh, well. It was better than Paris, Peter. I've learned a lot since then, sweetheart. I want to be with you always. I never bet on tomorrow. Who knows what fate has in store for us, huh? Ah. Why don't you try knocking sometime, Leo? Just make a fist and hit the door. Mr. Peter, Captain Lubert is on his way here. I'll meet you downstairs. You may hear me singing the blues, baby. Please, don't get me confused, baby. For you. Thanks. Nice to see you. The usual. Captain Lubert is going to want to see the documents. Captain Lubert does not always get what he wants. When did she start working for me? Tonight. Mr. Peter, the documents, please? Relax, my old friend. Enjoy the song. A cheek to cheek slow dance. When I'm sitting the blues. Well, well. I think I'm thirsty. Then go get it yourself. I'm in the mood for a little room service. Hey, fuck you. No, fuck you. You got any gas, Pops? Yep. $0.25 a gallon. Two bits a gallon? Yeah, that's about the going price. Two bits. Is that all the money? That is highway robbery, Pops. Kid, take it easy. I...I...I... Hey, you know what I don't like about citizens like you? What? Look, just leave me alone, huh? Hey, you never. You never pull the trigger. Leave my grandfather alone. Please? Cool it, Turk. Hey, Nicky, hey. It was like totally awesome out there. The waves were out of sight. I'm like gushy flesh all over. So, what do you want to do tomorrow? Wind surfing sounds good, huh? I'm going to go take a quick shower. Nick, can I get you something? Come here. Amazing. Simply amazing. I'll wait for you here, OK? All right. Attention all crew members, weekend is now over. You know what, guys? I already can't wait till next weekend. Did you have fun in the '50s there, DJ? Oh. You ever ride a Harley before? I can't say that I have, but I can say I just rode the shit out of a bathtub. Hey, Marlon, did you get to screw the trash compactor? You're leaking. Morning, Marlon. Boy, something about seeing him on Monday morning reminds me why I'm not married. Hey, I heard a joke for you. How many New Yorkers to take to change a light bulb? None. Fuck you. Hey, guys, wait up. We're back. Where's Mancuso? He's on the bridge. You know, I've been up here with that guy for three months now, and I just realized he's a manic depressive. Now you ain't too quick on the draw, are you, partner? Did you have a nice weekend, Mancuso? You changed the course. That's right. I'm supposed to be the navigator. Why the hell didn't you tell me first? You're on a need to know basis, Mancuso. Or did you forget? So anyway, there I was, my six gun drawn, figured some jackass would come gunning for me. But it was a broad. I mean, Peter, I thought I had died and gone ahead. Are you trying to me you reprogrammed your weekend so that you have two women? Hell, if I could do that, do you think I'd settle for just two? Coordinates at cosine 0.75, projected gravitational sling past the Delphi System? So there we are. Are you sure? You should know. Computers don't lie. You come busting in here on me like that again, Mancuso, and I'll fry your cortex. I just ran a projection. You're taking us into G Sector. You got a problem with that? Yeah. I like staying alive. You're unique in that matter, Mancuso. I know what G Sector is. Well, you know where the door is. It's hump day, boys. Hump diggity dog day. We are sliding on down to the weekend. You boys keep worrying about that damn G Sector, and old Mr. Pecker going to pack his bags and go on home. Hump day. Your bet. The sector's uncharted, Lloyd. They've sent electromagnetic probes out there. Every one of them has come back blank. What are you saying? There's nothing there? According to our definition. But we're going in there to rescue somebody? Oh, great. Right smack in the middle of it. Dead space, gentlemen. Holy Jesus Christ, I can't believe I'm sitting here, playing poker with a bunch of Alices. No one's ever made it out of there, man. What are you, some kind of boogey man? Hell, the only thing that concerns me is whether that new filly is going to be sitting her fine self right here on Friday night. Oh, by the way... New filly, Lloyd? Jealous? No. Hump day. Where the hell did you get this? I found it. There's no label on it, man. Don't lie to me, you asshole. Where the fuck did you get it? Hey, shit, what's wrong with you, man? Easy. What's that? Let's go. What gives? It's a distress signal. The origin is in G Sector. I'm getting a Doppler reading on that distress signal. Got an ETA? Yeah, seven, maybe eight days. Thanks, big guy. What is this? Noose and a mosquito. A week, huh? That's the guess. Listen to the man. One week, seven days, and we hook that sucker up, turn around, and tow her home. We're all going to be free men. Gotta love this guy, right? A piece of cake. Space cake. I tell you boys what, I'm going to take you and you and DJ to the best little bar in Houston. Picture this. Ice cold brews served up by the most naked women you've ever seen. Real women, huh? The kind that will slap you upside the head you get out of line. You buying? Hell, you got all my money. I'll let you win a few hands. OK, you asshole. Brick shit house. You in? Yeah. What the hell's that? Damage control. Damage control. Oxygen line rupture, forward grid. Damage control. Damage control. Oxygen line rupture. Shut the main valve. I got it. It's frozen. What do we do? Air pressure at 30,000 and falling. Try to vent the... Lloyd. We go to auxiliary. Hey, this is frozen too. Get it down. We've got to go down to auxiliary, sir. Commander Skylar, you will take us down to your cabin and we will to auxiliary. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. What do we got? 22,000. Right here, sir. Get out. What? These codes are for eyes only, Mancuso. Just do it, Commander. Main power now offline. Auxiliary reactor online. That damn pipe should not have burst. That was too damn close. Listen, I thought you guys were supposed to have done priority section search on this. I stress tested it myself. Yeah, in your fantasy. Nice job. You almost fucking killed us. Hey, I didn't miss nothing. Easy, easy. Look, you go check the schematics, all right? Go ahead. Get out of here. Let's patch this sucker up and get on it. - I tested it, Nick. - I believe you. Let's go. Don't go anywhere, Marlon. Do you think this is going to hold it? We'll know in a minute. That son of a bitch. Hold it. Hold it. Hey. I'll fix that little wise ass. Jesus Christ. Relax, man. Just relax. what You heard it too? You fucking jackass. Hey, listen, wait a minute. Hey. Hey, I thought you were the only other guy around here with a brain in his head. Now, listen, you reduce the odds of us getting back any further, and I'll end it for you. It wasn't me, I swear. Look. I broke it myself. I broke it in two when I found out how it screwed Peter up. I didn't do it. Somebody's screwing with us, man. Big time. Shit. One week before we turn around and go home and this has to happen. Talk about bad timing. You think you fixed it? We'll now in a minute. What time is it? Two hours to Weekend. Well, maybe my timing is not so bad after all. OK, let her rip. OK, Skylar, let her rip. Let her rip. Maybe I spoke too soon? Maybe he's drunk. Well, whatever he's drinking, I'm going to buy that man a case. Mr. Pecker is talking. He says the weekend has arrived. Auxiliary power offline. Main reactor online. So you're going back to where men are men and the cows are scared, right, Hoss? Suck it, DJ. OK. Lloyd, Lloyd, you can't. There's too many of them. Annie, go on back to the hotel. Annie, I ain't going to live my life wondering when Frank Strange is going to come gunning for me. Besides, this town ain't safe till that skunk ass ploecat is six feet under. Now, go on. It ain't safe out here. Now go on. Give me that. I've been waiting five years for this. A man shouldn't wait that long to die, Frank. I don't plan to. What the? It ain't supposed to happen this way. Say good bye. Wait a minute. The program... Gary Cooper, you're not. Annie? Annie? I'm sorry. Do my back, cowboy? Hot damn. I like my blues clean. I like them dirty. As good as new, or like in 1930. Give me the blues in the morning, the blues in the night. That's the only sound that makes me feel just right. Ah, Captain Lubert, a cognac? Hand over the documents, then we shall have a cognac. I'm afraid I can't do that. You are a fool. Maybe. But there's a war going on out there, Lubert, and those documents are going to make a difference. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday. Peter, I'm afraid this is the end of a beautiful friendship. Arrest him. Mind if I finish my drink? I'm not playing the rest. I have felt my best while singing the blues. Peter. Get down. Oh. She's not supposed to die. Hey, I said, cool it, man. Hey, you better be ready for me, DJ. What's the matter? Ain't you got no gonads? You let citizens push you around? I don't let nobody push me around, not even you, Turk. Your old man's a pansy. Come on. Bitch. We gonna ride or what? I don't get it. Just ride. Some fine piece of machinery you got here, guy. Hey, you, get your hands off that bike. It's mine. Wait. Wait a second. What about your grandfather? Screw him. What are you doing? This isn't my program. That's nice. OK. OK. What? What's going on? Hey. Hey. Babe, what's going on? You. Where's the other girl? Oh, she's, um, she's taking a dip. Just... I told you I'm not into this shit. Oh, God. Whoever put you in the program sure got a nasty streak in him. Now tell me, tell me you don't like nasty. Oh. Oh, your body is saying yes. But your eyes are saying no. You got that straight. Hm, that's what I'm talking about. Knock it off. You know you want it. You keep telling me. Ariel. Ariel. No. No. What the hell? What's going on? The ship is breaking apart, man. We'd better get extra time for this, damn it. Whoa. Commander? Commander? Your ship is falling apart. We'll make it. We passed over. The G Sector. I thought someone was accessing my program. That's why I lost it when i heard that song. Well, we've all seen her, right? It's the same woman. In my fantasy, she tossed a lighter and blew up the entire gas station. Swear to God, her grandfather in it. You guys talk like it's real. Nick's right. It could have been an anomaly, probably, probably an electromagnetic glitch when we came over into G Sector. Well, maybe you're right, but stuff like that in a computer program doesn't just show up by itself. Somebody had to put it there. Somebody with a sick sense of humor. She ain't a fucking glitch. Then what is she, Lloyd? Well, maybe if you were a man you'd know. Hey, take it easy. God, come on. Hey, screw you, Mancuso. Oh, you got all the answers, don't you? You win all my money at poker, and now, you shit on my fantasy. Hey, you're slime. You're crazy. And you're history. Attention all crew members, report to the bridge immediately. Attention all crew members, report to the bridge immediately. Come on, guys, you deaf? Attention all crew members, report to the bridge. She isn't real, is she? Attention all crew members, report... Remember that bar of yours in Houston where the girls serve you naked? Yeah. Keep it in your head. I'm going to buy you the coldest beer in Texas. Let's go see what this is all about. What's going on? We found the Holly. Yeah. Where's that sum bitch? Left 2. Left, 2, commander. Hold it. Hold it. Stand by for firing retros four and seven. Begin now. 3, 2, 1, fire. Ignition. We have ignition. Confirm alignment on transverse connector. Alignment's confirmed. Let her go. We have a secure dock. McClellan, DJ, you stay on the bridge. Mancuso and Crane, board with me. Prepare to board. Damn it. All this way, I don't even get it go. Consider yourself lucky. So where are the triggers on these babies? Space commission charter forbids you from carrying weapons. When we board the Holly, you might wish you'd broken the rules, sir. Let me worry about that, Mancuso. Let's go. Holly's a sister ship. Everything an exact duplicate. Holy shit. Jesus Christ. All right, everybody keep going. Holy shit. What the heck is this? It's a series 40. Fail safe device. Every ship in the fleet has one. Yeah, they started using them in the year 2011. It'll keep the enemy from stealing our technology. Like a bomb? Oh, no, much more effective. Its turbines work directly into the pipes of the ship creating enough pressure to blow the whole God damn works. This guy was trying to blow up the whole ship. Why would he be doing that? You got any theories, Commander? You got any theories? What the hell are you doing, Mancuso? I'm doing my job, whatever that is. You won't find anything. The system's been busted. Oh, Jesus. You ask me, these guys were firing at each other, and the winner cooked himself. You gonna tell us what's going on here? We'll return to the Presley. Hook a line out and bring it back. God damn it, Commander, there are Americans dead all over the ship. What was the Holly doing out here in the first place? Get the hell out of here. Peter, where in the hell's that coffee? Peter? Quit playing with yourself and get me some coffee, please? And hold the cream, OK? Peter? Peter. Peter? Hey, a cup of coffee too much for you? You killed her. You know I live for caffeine. You killed her. God damn it, you killed her. You need to try some decaf, Peter. Oh, shit, Oh, shit, Booby trapped and this place is a goddamn minefield. Let's get the fuck out of here. Come on, we've got to keep going. Try it again. Nothing. This damn computer's not responding. Where the hell have you been? I tried to French kiss a meteor. Look, you've got to get inside this thing. You've got to override this computer, all right? I've given it a command for 180 degree turn, no dice. We're going home, right? You got that right, Bub. Now you push those buttons right and get this baby home. DJ? I can't override the ship's onboard navigational system. I'm locked out. OK, use everything you know, man, but get inside and get us the hell out of here. DJ said Peter just wigged out. He kept yelling, DJ killed her. Sh. Just like that, like a rabid dog or something. DJ had to take him down. Here we go. Is that identical to the Holly? Yep, five minute delay, whole nine yards. Can you disable it? No fucking way. Jesus, I thought you were going back to the quarters. You know, it's 20,000 bolts to the brain for a mutiny, Nick. The way Skylar is going on, the point may be moot. The real question is, can you get inside this thing? Hell, man, I can make a bomb out of a cowpie. Well, maybe you better start looking for some cows, bull breath. Here, boss. Here, baby. 50, 20... Find anything, DJ? Do you mind not smoking in my face? What, are we slipping into some black hole of hairless space? I thought you left your woman at home. Watch it, boy. Can't override this. There's no way. You can't put your initials in for high score? Ha ha. Hey, those are the virtual reality programs. Single, no. Double helix, shit, running diagnostic for infections. Infection? You mean, we can catch VD from these programs? Holy shit. This is serious. Do you mind? Why don't you go stick plastique down your pants and blow yourself. Hey, listen, DJ, if I need to be wearing chaps, you know when I'm riding in the saddle, you'd better come clean with me now, boy. Listen to me, Lloyd. If what I see here is right, we're going to need a lot more than lambskin to protect us. Ow. Ow. Ow. It's me. What? I found something. OK, I couldn't get into the ship's navigational system, so, I know. I know. So I tried breaking into other programs and I went through everything on the ship, and then I got to our weekend programs and I found this. So what am I looking at? It's a virus of some kind. Only I think it's screwing up every system we have on the ship. Use the antiviral program. I tried that. Nothing happened. So I ran a biochemical scan of it. You mean it's alive? Yeah, something like that. It's coded like our DNA, only it's like nothing I've ever seen before. You're telling me it's alien? What I'm telling you is, that in our world, nothing like this even exists, OK? Watch, I'll generate an image using the information from the DNA code. You clever, clever boys. You two have gone where no men have gone before. I'm proud. And you know pride makes me so horny. Oh my god. Oh, you won't be needing this anymore. You know, you came up here a boy, but you're going home a man. Stop it. Skylar, put it down. She's mine, Mancuso. So jealous. It's not a she. First, the Holly, now us. Whatever they are, they're sucking us in. Don't forget the Joplin. And that was the first. That was why the Holly was up here, looking for the Joplin. Of course, they didn't find much. I got off 10 seconds before she blew. And you came back, didn't you, pumpkin? This time to stay. They're going to send another ship looking for us, and another and another. How many men are going to die, Commander? Every member of your fleet, we hope. Shit. He's down coded it. Hey, where's Lloyd? She came to me, Nick. It wasn't the Weekend. It was real. Pete, will you knock it off? It's only going to take about two words from that holographic bitch for Skylar to be back in here wasting all of us. Listen to me, man, The Holly's gone, so's the Joplin. Who knows how many others? This guy's got to be stopped. - Hey. Hey. Jesus Christ, you're talking about mutiny. Yeah. I don't seem to have too much luck with authority figures, do I? Now, look, DJ, I'm going to need you. I need your smarts. Those assholes at fleet will never buy my story alone. Can I count on you? Yeah. Yes. Good man. Pete? I can't believe it. She was going to marry me. Pete. He's gone. Damn, you look good when you sweat. Return with me now to the thrilling days of yesteryear. This little gal sure enjoyed your six gun, Lloyd. You remember how it felt? So good. It was so perfect. I never met a man that fit me like you do. Do it, Lloyd. Do it. They we'll have forever. Lloyd? Huh? It wasn't locked. No matter. I just like to blow shit up anyway. You're the man. Ariel? She's mine, asshole. No, no, no. Bastard. self-destruct command initiating. Ship will self-destruct in T minus five minutes. You're dead, Mancuso. Oh, shit. DJ? Ship will self-destruct in T minus 4 minutes 30 seconds. - Ah! - DJ! Ah! Ariel, I'm ready. Peter, no! Come to Mama. Peter, don't! Ship will self-destruct in T minus 3 minutes 30 seconds. Ship will self-destruct in T minus 3 minutes. Ship will self-destruct in T minus 2 minutes 30 seconds. Drop it. You screwed up, asshole. I could have stopped the count down. There's always the escape module, darling. I'm going to frag your cortex. Ariel, Ariel, no. No. No. Not him. No, me. Me. I love you. Don't. No. I did it all for you. Don't you see? I love you. Why? Why'd you help me? I don't know. I guess, I just like you best. It's been nice knowing you, you bitch. Ship will self-destruct in T minus 1 minute 30 seconds. Hiya, sport. I;d make this a really dry batch. The ship will self-destruct in T minus 1 minute. It's just you and me now, right, babe? Ship will self-destruct in T minus 50 seconds. Ship will self-destruct in T minus 40 seconds. The ship will self-destruct in T minus 30 seconds. I really hope you don't die. I think we have something very special. Ship will self-destruct in T minus 10 seconds. 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, goodbye. I know it's going to be a little cramped, handsome, but we'll make do.
