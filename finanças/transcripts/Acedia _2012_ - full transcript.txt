All right listen. There's got to be some kind of solution There could be a doctor you can go to. I took care of it in the beginning. I went to someone who was able to handle it. And now everything's going apart. I can't lose it. But what do you mean someone who could handle it? Like a doctor? It doesn't matter. It does matter. If you go to the wrong person person that person could kill your daughter in the wrong way. The thing is she was good. Now all of a sudden everything's falling apart. I've got to make it better. I cannot lose her. It will kill me. I will kill myself if I lose her. Okay. You're not gonna do that first of all. You have to think about what you're doing and do not go to somebody who you don't know what they can do. Go to a doctor. Go to a priest. [Voice Fading] Gisella? Gisella? Gisella? Gisella? Gisella Where are you? Oh there you are you. You just keep on appearing everywhere and disappearing. Okay. I have a story. It's about a magical box. [Unknown Language] What's the matter? Take the box and wish on it. Everything you want will come true. What are you reaching for? Well. Tell me about it. All right. This is a magical box. And everybody loves it.

Eternity will be mine. This box is amazing. I know. I wish I can find it somewhere. Well maybe it could be in that window or behind the picture frame or anywhere. Yeah probably. I'm determined to find this box. I'll help you if you like. Okay. He's sick. Oh I'm gonna make sure I'm there for her. That's the thing.

You're really scaring me. The one thing I've learned in this situation is you've got to take matters into your own hands. And that's what I'm going to do. I'll make it right, I can fix this. Just don't do anything stupid. [????] [????] [????] Charles I will grant you a wish. Bring me new people to this town. If you Bring me people you will get your immortality.

I tell you now there is no box. He's not being straight with us. What was going on over there? It's the evilness of this box. Oh that Noah's ark box? Father Demetriouss. Do you know anything about this box. The history? Yes. Yes I do. There's a deep tradition about the box. It comes from the wood of the actual ark. This box has the ability to grant wishes to whoever finds it. Any wish of any kind. But it can also take away any wish. The box can be pure evil. Yeah we're only here for a plain exorcism. This house is cleaned. Well then we just do a standard exorcism. That's it. And we're done. Agreed. Let's proceed. Hi there. Hi. What are your names? I'm Danielle and this is Dede and Lina. They don't talk? No. They don't speak. They are six years old and I am nine. We are cousins and lived in that house before the fire. You lived in the house before the fire? We play in the garden all the time except when she's there. She doesn't let us play there. Who? The lady in white that doesn't have a name. Some say she isn't a woman at all. The townspeople call her the woman in the garden. Her son was killed and her husband died in the war. She visits that place waiting for both of them. And where is she now? [Birds Chirping] Father Dimitri. So I fully understand what is... Why do we have to wait? Well. In accordance with the bible and tradition the house must be made clean. We cannot just walk in and do an exorcism. There is a lot of preparation. Remember. This is not just anybody can do this. I have a lot of faith in father Dimitri. I trust that he will do fine. You guys will be safe. And remember. This is not our first one. We have done many. Help!! (Help. Please.) Always remember (Somebody. Help me) It is about the heart, mind and the soul. This is not something you can just go through. You guys see that? You need to be prepared to clean the house before you make the exorcism. Hey. You need help? I can help you. If you stop I can help you. Why do you run? I can help you. I'm here to help you. [Falls on the ground] Woah [Breathing Heavily] Oh Dear. Help me!! Father Demetriouss [Voices] Father Marcus [Voices] Somebody help. [Voices] When I was a little boy I had a nightmare and in that dream I couldn't move Wait a minute. There's still more time son. Come with me into the light. When I was a little boy I had a nightmare And in that nightmare I couldn't speak. When I was a little boy I had a nightmare. And in that nightmare I got lost in the forest. And no one ever found me. Something bad is gonna happen to you Jonathan. Stay close to us. Marcus. I need to tell you something. What is it? I went to the garden to sit and pray for a little while. And I saw these three little girls came up to me and They said that they lived in this house before the fire. Fire? Yeah. And They also spoke of this evil woman in all white. And I asked them Where is this woman? And they pointed and when I looked up there was this woman in all white. Very very pale yet dark at the same time. And then all of a sudden they weren't there. I don't know if I ever told you this but when I was a young boy My dad had passed away And before he died He had said to me; Jonathan. In your walk you're gonna see many things you don't understand. But you need to keep your faith and keep your eyes on Jesus Christ. I now know what he meant. Jonathan You sure you're not imagining this? There's three girls come on. If we tell this to the elders you know what will happen. They'll put us in the crazy house. There's a lot of strange things going on. And What does this talk about a box? I really feel like I need to tell the elders. No. No no no that is not. We don't need to do that. Telling the elders would be the worst thing to do. Don't worry about it. Listen to me right now. Look. Who brought you in? Who brought you in to this? I did. If I don't tell them and they find out and something goes horribly wrong Nothing will go wrong. Listen do you want to be excommunicated? We tell them we start seeing things We'd be tainted to death. You know I don't. Listen. Trust me trust me and have faith. What did Father Demetriouss say? I do have faith Then everything will be fine. We have nine hours to the exorcism. Let's do everything as planned. Fine Okay I won't tell them. Hi Hi. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm doing well.

Please please Leave me alone [not audible] You want to speak to me? Yes I hear that you're talking about the box. I didn't say anything about the box. The box saved my daughter. Why would I talk about it? It's not what I heard. It's all around town. Everyone knows you're talking about the box. I told one priest because it stopped working. The box stopped working. She's sick again. She hasn't been sick in a long time. I can't go through it again. I sacrificed everything for her. Yeah good. You already told one priest. You spoke about the box. It was one person. If the box could help her I wouldn't say a word It's our box. It's our secret. Fine. I'll leave it alone. Thank you. Marcus. I love you so much. Marcus. He said we would be together. Is that you? What are you doing here? Marcus. Marcus. Marcus. Brother Marcus. Alan? How are you? You seem troubled. Are you okay? What's wrong? Yes uh I'm fine I just You know when you think you've seen a ghost. No. What did you think you saw? Sorry. I'm sorry it must have been nothing. I saw this woman Woman? This woman in this black robe and she she... My father was the groundskeeper here before I and my grandfather was also a groundskeeper. And 50 years ago when I was just a little boy He used to tell me stories about Young brothers who had joined the monastery who came here and saw illusions of beautiful women. And there was no woman and they would run after them and chase after them And they'd go off into the woods right over there and they'd never be seen again. But yeah that's not gonna happen to you right I mean That was a story I thought he would tell me that story just so I would stay close To home so I'd be close to the family. But it's very odd that you mentioned that you saw that woman Yes. But I'm sure it's different I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. You're not worried. Are you? Are you worried? No. Don't worry. Not at all. Take care. Please. Go back to the monastery. [Bird Chirping[ Dad? Dad it's me.

Why turn away your son when today If you take the box and wish upon it. You can be with him. Right now and forever. Take the box. I believe in god's kingdom and I will see my son again. But it won't be but with that box today. Gisella? Where are you? Are you in here? Oh there you are. I've been looking for you everywhere. Me too. I've been looking for you. Okay well I wanted to do something with you. What was that? Um well like we could do something maybe like find magic box. Marcella. You must not go near that box it's really evil. Um well okay. But why is it so evil? I don't know. I just found information about it. Well. I really wanted to find the box. Me too but I don't want to go near it Because of everything that might happen to you. Like what could happen to me? It's your soul that goes in the box once you wish for something. Like does it make you do anything? Like does it make you do that bad things? It had bad things. It depends what you wish for. And if you wish for something in the middle of that box then It sometimes makes you do bad things. I don't like this box anymore. Let's not look for it anymore. Yeah well if we find it we can do some more research on it. Well I wouldn't want to take the risk. Yeah. We could try. Yeah. But we wouldn't make a wish. Yeah Promise? Promise. Okay.

And how you sickly little human repay me back? You confined in a priest coming to this town. Excuse me father. Can I talk to you for a second? You spoke to that priest and asked for help.

Pathetic soon you'll take your last breath here on earth. Every breath you take thereafter. You will be breathing in the fires of hell. I've taken away all of them. Everything I've given to every soul. I've taken. When you enter hell. It will attack your bones and pick them. And break them as to you're the blame. All the souls of hell will be waiting for you. I'll grow your arms 20 feet in length. So you'll never nourish your own body. Or embrace another person for the rest of your pathetic life in hell. Enjoy it. Soon you'll spend eternity with me. Where's father Francis? He was to be here over an hour ago. We searched the entire grounds. We will have to do it without him. We'll have to go into the room. We have to perform at exorcism.

How did you arrive here my son? Carriage. Four horses with you. Pulling us all the way here. A long road. A long winding road traveling up to this place. You know. You know it's me. I'm starting to believe you. It's me. It's me Just tell me one more thing. Who is that tinnitus? Who is that tinnitus? He was He was the father that taught you. Yes he was.

You went off to become a priest You're nothing but a filthy pig. You took my home. You took my money. No mama. You don't mean that. I took care of you. When I was a single mother I gave you the life you could never have. I took care of you. It is not true. How could you? For so long I've looked up to you. Everything. Everything I know I've learned from you. How could you? It is not true. Betrayal doesn't suit you father. Do you even know where your mother is right now? I know I know I know where she is.

He that is greater than he that is in the world. Resist the devil and he shall flee from you. Resist the devil and he shall flee from you. He that is in me is greater than he that is in the world. He that is in me is greater than he that is in the world. Do you smell that? I love the smell of blood. Why is it that we love the ones who ignore us. But yet ignore the ones who love us? You think it was about the girl? She was sacrificed by the same people coming here to clean her. It never fails. Threaten the livelihood of a small village And they always find their black sheep to send for slaughter. So I ask. Did you achieve your objective? You know who I am. I dwell in every corner of darkness In famine sickness hate and pain. I've been here since the beginning. The tree of life. The fruit. You put your faith in such. I was there. The day of the crucifixion. Today humans killed the only son of god that could set them free. Yet he favors you over us. Your species are a group of destructive. Radicals that cannot be appeased. And you will find great comfort knowing That your sister the heroin addict, thief and prostitute resides in the fires of hell with me now Your sister moans like a whore as she's ravished by the demons. Every night over and over and over. Tonight you will have your flesh eaten to the bones by the demons And all the darkness will know this was Jonathan the priest the fool who thought that he could outsmart me. Not even praying can save true evil. That's why tonight... The angels have given you a pass. Pity. I know how this ends for you Jonathan. Whatever it is you think you may know I know where my soul is going. For my faith and relationship with Jesus Christ Has always been true. Oh I do know how this ends. That's why I always win. Because if you cannot pass through the evil How could you ever know the good? [Screaming] I knew it. I know. Come on. [Crying] [Crying] Oh god. Dad? How can this be? Its me son. Is everything okay? It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine.
