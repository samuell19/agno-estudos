Let me go. You know it's a mistake. You stink! I asked you something, ah? Answer. Get up. Get up. What's the problem? When my dad was a kid a gang of Russians used to beat him up. Alex, what's the speech about? Go back to the dishes. In a minute. It's very simple. You go up to their biggest asshole... The Russian fucking mafia. ...and kick his ass while the others shit their pants. Bastards. Alex, come inside right now. You, get out of here. It's not over yet. I said come in. See this fist? Keep your fingers shut tight. Otherwise you'll break your fingers. WHITE PANTHER Work with your legs. Come on, come on... Kick his ass! Come on, come on... You're getting good, bro. Why aren't you at work? I got fired. Don't worry, I'll take care of the money. I'm not worried, they'll call tomorrow. He doesn't hire Arabs and the locals won't do dishes. Are you going to wash dishes forever? It isn't funny. Don't waste your talents. Remember how you used to watch me and Papa work out? Remember? That was fun, wasn't it? You're not a kid anymore. And this is no game. Listen, I brought a new guy. OIe9- Hey, Oleg. You've come to the right place. Let's go, 9UY5- Hi, everybody. I'm glad to see so many new faces as well as old. For those of you who are here for the first time, I'll explain who we are and what we do. We're... Russians. And we don't let anybody grab our balls and stick our nose in shit like they're toilet-training a dog. Because that's how they see us. A few weeks ago the their head rabbi made a speech on TV. He called the Russian immigrants whores and alcoholics. Our mothers, our sisters, our girlfriends, he called them all whores. They think we'll shut up and take it. The hell we will! We won't shut up and take it. That's why you're here, so they'll learn to fear us. Today you'll learn to tear apart every motherfucker who tries to grab your balls. Because we'll never be like... our parents. They're afraid to look up but we're different, we're the White Panthers. We're... The White Panthers! We are... -Russians! We are... -Russians! We are... -Russians! We are... -Russians! Russians! Russians! And never forget it! Alex, Alex... Alex. Stay away from Yevgeni. He'll get you in trouble. Focus on what matters, boxing, girls. Okay, Mama. Good night. They're good 9UY5- Good evening. May we? Just a minute, okay? Excuse me. At least the girls are pretty... How does this work? Wait on the side, please. Forget it, Yevgeni, let's go home. Home? It's Thursday. The club's going to hell, soon it'll be all Russian. Is there a problem? Grab him! Run! Run! Fuck offl Police. Get out of here. Back offl Back off, I said! You live in District D. You ruined the neighborhood, you kids hanging around with your tattoos, spraying Nazi graffiti. If it was up to me I'd send you all back to Russia. Your dad must be proud of you. Don't talk about my dad. Killed in action. Where, in Russia? No, here. In Jenin, in Operation Defensive Shield. Was he a soldier? No, a cook. Take his details. A kid with so much probation on his record... once he's in jail he'll never get out. Check if his father was killed in action. Yes, he volunteered to the army 3 months after he came to Israel. That's funny, David, his dad was a boxer too. Champion of Moscow. Delete all the details on this kid. But I started... -Then stop and delete his details. David... -Don't argue, I'm in charge of the kids in the projects. Do you want to be a boxer like your dad? I'm asking, do you want to be a boxer like your dad? Look... I have an offer for you. I have a club. Golden Gloves, in Tiberias. Instead of sitting here in jail, you can train with me. Are you shitting me? Do I look like I'm shitting you? But one little fuckup and I come to your house and throw you back in jail. Think about it. Itk fun to speak free Eminem can eat me I can freestyle ten times better than he... So if you got nothin' to say Just say "moron"and go away 'Cause I ain't here to play... It's Alex. Did they release him? Hey, bro, wait a sec. You're on probation, how did you get out? I cut a deal with them. We worked something out. Don't cut deals with those animals, they're only out for themselves. Remember who you are and who you're loyal to. Come sit with us. No, I'm tired. Alex... I love you, bro. It's that asshole. What's that junkie doing here? Yasmin, you go out, and all the boxers follow you. Sorry, dad. Get inside. Move in, force him into the corner! The corner! Great, great! Get closer, Danny, keep your right open. Arms back in place. Let's put you in the roster. Come here. This is Alex Zeitlin. Put him on our roster. How are you paying? -He isn't. It's on me. Everyone's on you. But how will our club support itself, Dad? Yasmin, don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong. Come. Breathe, breathe. Hold it. Concentrate when you hit. When you do, all of the force goes into your fist and it's less tiring. Breathing is the basis. Good. Good. Keep your left strong. Good. Hold me so I can't attack. Good! Get back in place, like this. When you open up, go right back into place. Concentrate. Good. There's the bastard who picked on Oleg. You guys, that's the bastard who picked on Oleg. This guy? Get him. What's up, Zion? You promised we'd meet again. Why are you running away? Oleg, come here. Come here. Hit him. He'll learn. Not like that. Watch me. Hit him. -Stronger. -Kick him. Son of a bitch! Motherfucker! Hit him stronger. Come on! One moment. Listen, Alex, find me two boys who want to make some money. What's the problem? I'll go. It's not for you, Alex. Tell them they'll get a few hundred shekels an hour. What's the matter, Yevgeni, aren't I good enough? Alex, you don't need this, believe me. Find me two guys. I'm coming with you. Moshe, how are you? Sasha sent me. Son of a bitch! Yevgeni, what are you doing? I have no choice. Someone has to pay the electric bill. I told you not to come but you insisted. Mama, what are you doing outside? You shouldn't be here... Alex, where were you all night? Mama, the doctor told you to stay inside. You shouldn't be hanging out with Yevgeni. I know what you're doing. I've lost both you and Yevgeni. You didn't lose me, I'm here. It's okay. I've failed. I couldn't... If only Papa were alive... Now I can't... I can't even visit his grave. What would I tell him? Yevgeni is a lost cause, I thought I could save you... but I lost you too. Let's go home. I can't take it anymore. Come on, let's go... Come on. It's all right. Let's go... -Alex... Where do you go? Why aren't you focused? Why aren't you focused? Huh? Yell at me. Yell! Louden Louden Good. Louden Alex. Come here. Take a break. 1969, I was the champion. I want you to be a champion too. Want some? Give me that. Have some. Just taste it. Good, huh? Take it, there's plenty. Alex, what did the cop talk to you about? About us? Sit down. Alex, we're family... How did that cop and his daughter steal you from us? Nobody stole me. I just want my dream to come true. You're so naive. Well, I won't burst your bubble. This is Alex, my little brother. This is Sasha. We're partners now. Sasha wants to invest in you, open a boxing club for you. We'll give you money, find you a place, buy you all the equipment. Get it? All your dreams will come true. You teach them to box and we'll take care of the rest. Come on. Guard your face. Give it to him! That's the way. -Use your right. Hold on. StOP- Why did he stop them? Let him hit with his right, if he lowers his arm, come in from below. He's giving him special treatment. Great! Put him in the corner! Goom Nice, Alex. He's a criminal. You give him special treatment. Won't you get it before everyone snaps at you? Enough, Yasmin, enough. Stay out of my business, enough! We're barely scraping by as it is, we won't survive this way. Is he worth losing everything for? Nothing's being lost. And no one's leaving so soon. Everyone knows he doesn't pay. And all the boxers are mad at you. How do they know? Who told them? You? Listen, David... It was a mistake coming here in the first place. You can arrest me if you want. Who'll take care of your mom when you're in jail? Take a seat. Listen, we can get the Boxing Federation to pay for your training. We just need to certify that you're a bereaved family. Right, Yasmin? Everyone will benefit. You want to train, don't you? Do you or don't you?! Yasmin, go home with him and find all the papers he needs. Dad, I'm not... -Yes you are. You sure are. I didn't ask you to be his buddy, I just asked you to get the papers. Okay, let's get this over with. Come on. Get up. Where do you live? I grew up here. It must have been nice before the Russians came. Don't put words into my mouth. If you don't like it here, go back to Russia. Always the same line, right? You said you're in a hurry, right? I love sweets, that's my weakness. Then take this. -No, no. They have filling, they're delicious. This is my marriage certificate. It's in Russian. These are my wedding pictures, I sewed my dress myself. -You're beautiful. Everyone's beautiful when they're young. Do you get your looks from your mother? -Thanks, my mom was beautiful. -Was? She died of cancer two years ago. What's she doing here? First my brother, now my mom? Get out of here. Why the hell did you bring her here? Yevgeni. -What? Get out. Get out. Thanks. Fuck! What now? Heavy, huh? I'm sorry about your mom, I didn't know. How could you have known? Your mom is really nice. So is your dad. I know you don't like the fact that we're so close, but I believe in him and he believes in me even if I throw the hard truth in his face. So don't ruin it for me. My problem with him has nothing to do with you. So why don't we trade, your dad for my mom, then I'll be both Israeli and Jewish. It doesn't go by the father. Your mom's Jewish, isn't she? Then you're Jewish. Your rules are complicated. Let's get going before my dad freaks out. Wait a sec, I need a rest. Remember what they did to Papa. I remember. Go take a shower, then you're coming with me. I'm tired. I'm not asking. Go wash off the stink of cops. Tell Alex to paint. Yevgeni said you should paint too. Alex... Do you want to be a boxer or don't you?! Now here. Again. Good boy. Your father was a hero. No, no... No... Drink. See that cemetery? My father is buried there. I remember when I was a kid he'd take me to kibbutzim to work. We'd stand in line to get food to take home. The kibbutzniks looked down on us like we were low-Iifes. When my dad died in the war they buried him outside the fence. Since my mom didn't know Hebrew me and my brother went to talk to the military rabbi. You know what he said? "He isn't Jewish. There's nothing I can do." Three days after my dad dies... he says a thing like that. I believe in you, Alex. I believe in you. Breathe, breathe... A month from now the national championship preliminaries start. I swore that this year the champion will come from our club. I was the champion of Israel. He'll do anything for that Russkie. Zion, if you don't like it, you can go. What's with you? Do you have the hots for that gentile? Shut up. My dad is talking. Keep it down. -Okay, Dad. I always dreamed of being... Besides, his mom is Jewish. Yasmin, we shower with him. He's no Jew. You can see for yourself. When I was your age I pictured Marcel Cerdan all the time, pushing me to succeed. Do you always look at guys in the shower? I have a good feeling about this year. Alex... How are you? Gana wants to talk to you. Alex, how are you? Fine. How's the boxing? Fine. I remember going with Sasha to see your dad fight. We were big fans. I remember how your mom used to look at him, she was so proud of him... By the way, how is she? Sasha made you a great offer, he'll open a club for you, a top-notch, professional club. We like you. Don't let us down. If your mother is dear to you, if you want your brother alive and well, don't do anything stupid. We don't want this story to have an unhappy ending. Don't forget who you are. Do we understand each other? "Peace upon you, angels of peace "Angels on high "From the King of Kings "The holy one, blessed be He..." "Blessed are You, O Lord, "who sanctifies the Sabbath." -Amen. Shabbat Shalom. -Shabbat Shalom. Do you like it, Alex? Alex, I was your age here. They called me the Black Panther. Just because you're a redhead doesn't mean we're so different. Even though this was 40 years ago I was much more messed-up than you. This is Rachel, Yasmin's mother. The minute I met her all my rage disappeared. Love is... more important than money, than race, than honor. Well, David, it's late, so... I'll be going. - Wait a minute. Listen, Alex, it's just Yasmin and me here, and tomorrow I have a big meal at the synagogue, so do me a favor, take this to your mom, Yasmin made it. All right. Thanks. That's weird. -What's weird? My dad never spoke about my mom like that. Not to me, at least. I'm sorry, sorry about how I treated you when you came to train. Don't worry about it, I'm not mad. I'm not mad at you. I better get back before my dad gets the wrong idea. Do you think she'll make you an Israeli? You sacrificed your principles for a girl? Don't talk to me about principles after what happened at the synagogue. I was just trying to wake you up. You're gonna wake up and find no one around. No family, no friends, but then it'll be too late. "Regional Boxing Championship" Welcome to the semifinals of the Israeli men's championship. Keep your guard up! On your toes! Well done! Defense. Alex, get him into the corner! Good. That's the way! Alex, Alex, Alex... Give him a right! That's the way, Alex! Good! The semifinal contenders are: In the red corner: Morad Bana, Kfar Yassif Golden Gloves. In the blue corner: Alex Zeitlin from the Tiberias Golden Gloves. Go. No. Use your right! Concentrate! Guard your corner! One. Two. Three. Foun Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Out. The winner of the Israeli semifinals, Alex Zeitlin, Tiberias Golden Gloves, knockout. That's my boy. Wonderful, wonderful... I got a call, the burglar alarm went off. Sorry, I must have... It slipped my mind. Is this how you celebrate a victory? Go out, have a drink, have some fun, you deserve it. Come to the Trapeze with me. They didn't even let me in when I worked there. They will if you're with me. Come on. Come on, I'm buying. Where I come from girls don't pay for guys. Turning into a Moroccan, huh? Come on, big shot. I never saw my dad like that, he came home crying. I haven't seen him cry since my mom died. It was amazing. Yasmin. -Liron, what are you doing here? -Come here a sec. Just a second. -Come on. What did they want? -Nothing. Never mind. What do you mean, nothing? Does it bother them that you're with me? They said my dad will go ballistic, not because you're Russian... your father wasn't Jewish. That's ridiculous. Your dad doesn't care, he said so himself. Don't worry, I don't listen to what people say, I only listen to my heart. Let's dance. Let's make a deal, you teach me to box and I'll teach you to dance. You're doing it all wrong. Come on, I'll show you how. First of all, move this leg back a little. When you punch keep your hand straight. Like that. Right. Move your hip too. Where were you? -I went out. With Alex? How many times have I told you, stay away from my boxers. Especially Alex. I thought love was stronger than race, stronger than money, stronger than honor. I wish you'd talk to me half as much as you do with Alex. You gave up on me long ago, Dad. You wanted a boy but you got a girl. I may not say so, but I love you. You're the most important thing I have. Remember how Mom used to say that love is doing, not talking? Don't tell me you love me. I'll be with whoever I want. He believes in you, don't let him down too. The beer% almost finished, though it was as tasty as a banana on a tree. Flowers and maybe something else... Want some? ltk strong and clean, like gin. Maybe... a pretty picture, 3 PTBTCV girl... Remember you told me that the happiest day of your life will be when you make your mom proud? Next week is the championship. Training regime. No going out, no hanging out until 4 a.m. Did Yasmin tell you? I'm her father. She tells me everything. Don't worry, David. I won't let you down. Hi. What's up? I wanted to wish you luck. Why, aren't you... coming with us? -No. My dad wants you to stay focused. I don't want to ruin this for you. Alex, get on the bus. I want you to do well. -Okay, all right. Get on the bus. What are you doing here? -I came to wish you luck. How many times have I asked you... National Championship What are you doing here? What do you think you're doing? What is this? Why isn't Yasmin here? I thought it was okay with you. Let's not talk about it now. Do you have a problem with me, David? Since you're asking, yes. Stay away from my daughter. She's not for you. We'll talk about it after the fight. You have a problem with me, David? With me? Alex, you know I love you, find another girl, someone with your mentality. You're infatuated now so you don't notice, but it'll tear you apart. Believe me. Let's talk about it after the fight. Come on. Come on already. Welcome to the Israeli Boxing Championship, being held in Kfar Yassif. In the blue corner: Alex Zeitlin, Tiberias Golden Gloves, and Amjad Jihadi, Kfar Yassif Golden Gloves. Box! Stop. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Don't push, please, don't push. What are you doing, Alex? Don't push him. Alex! Stop. One. Two. -What are you doing? Three. -What are you doing? Five. Six. Seven. Eight. -What are you doing? One... One. Get up, Alex. Three. Four, five, six, seven, eight. Stop. Up and down. Forfeit. Have you lost you mind? Why are you doing this to me? Find yourself another boxer, a Moroccan, someone with your own mentality. Your hatred leaves me no choice, to escape this paralysis I beat up all the suckers, the stupid motherfuckers. We aren't the mafia but we're thick as thieves through blood and death, through blood and death, damn it. Yes, this is a tough song. Whoever isn't with us is against us... Thank you, enjoy your evening and may you win lots of money. You were great. -Thanks. I'm glad you learned your lesson. Forget everything you learned, a soldier is no different from a boxer. Soldier? I thought I was training boxers. Listen, don't meddle in our business, okay? You still stink of cops. Don't mouth off to him again, Sasha, he isn't me, if you let him down, there's no way back. I told you to stay away from my family. I told you. Let's go to my house. Didn't I make myself clear? Yevgeni, leave her alone. Yevgeni, relax. You shame me and your father's memory. You're a coward. You too. You both make me sick. Come with me. Sasha's waiting downstairs. I don't want to leave Mama alone. It won't take long. Listen, you chose to come back to us. You made your choice. Sasha's waiting. Come with me. The most important thing is trust. I don't trust you. What do you want from me? I want you to prove your worth. Let's go. Now's the time, bro. Hey, old man. Yevgeni, what are you doing? He's just an old man. What are we doing? What's wrong with you? Do you realize what's this all about? Come here... Hit him, Alex. I said, hit him. Alex, hit him, I beg you. Kick his ass! Go ahead! Give it to him, God damn it! Take this... Fuck you. Go fuck off to your monkey friend. You don't have a home anymore. Asshole. Good thing Ohana isn't here, you were his biggest hope. What a fool. He thought he could save you. I want to call him. -Come here. I want to call him. Hello? David, please don't hang up. Listen, I... I'm at the police station and my mom is alone at home. Come get me released. Please. David, I won't let you down again, I swear. I'll do whatever you say, I'll stay away from Yasmin... I'll be the best boxer in the country, in the world. Please get me released, I swear I won't let you down. David, I have to be with my mom. David. David? Mrs. Zeitlin? Vera. Vera? Alex. David. "May His great name be praised and sanctified... "May His great name be praised and sanctified... "In the world which He created... "In the world which He created... "And may He rule... "And may He rule... "And may His salvation blossom... "And may His salvation blossom... "In our lives and our days..." Calm down, Alex. How did you get out? Alex... I told the cops everything that goes on here. I'm not afraid of you. What the hell? Fuck you, I'm not afraid of you. Of anybody. I PW you. You're like sheep, believing those scumbags. What are you, their whores? What did you say? Watch your mouth. Look at yourselves. They don't give a shit about your ideology. Use your brains before it's too late. Police. You're surrounded. Come out with your hand up! Yasmin, I... I promised your dad. Yasmin, I'm not a coward anymore. If you turn coward, I'll just up and leave.
