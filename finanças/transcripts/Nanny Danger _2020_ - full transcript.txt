[clears throat] you see, I've, uh, I've mentored a lot of young talent in this business but I, but think the enduring question is can they stick with it? Because it can be incredibly cut-throat. (jamie) okay, here I go. - Back to interviews. - Good luck, jamie. Your resume is amazing. I mean, ivy league. Phi beta kappa. Captain of lacrosse team. And the debate team. I would love the opportunity to work for this company. My degree in management has given me-- [sighs] I'm sorry we're just looking for more experienced candidates. I understand. But I was hoping to gain experience by working with this company. I'm willing to start wherever I need to in order to-- I'm really sorry. But we can't bring in any unexperienced candidates. How do I get experience if I can't get a job? I'm really sorry. Once your resume's stronger. Come back when you have more experience. It's a competitive market. Next. [instrumental music] no, I mean, it's like I have a sticker on my forehead that says zero experience. Have you ever considered joining the police force with your aim? [chuckles] - no, that's pretty good. - Eh.. And don't worry, something will come along. Ooh. - Ah! - Hm. - All three on the board. - Yay. I'll remind you of that when rent's due when I can't pay my half. Hey, you know who got the last job I applied for that I was perfect for? - The guy's nephew. - The guy's nephew. I mean, it just comes down to experience and who you know and I come short in both categories. - What are you gonna do? - Find a temp job.

Page, with page industries posting record profits this quarter. How would you respond to the public's outcry for local businesses to aid in their need? 'do you have any plans to reinvest' 'your funds into the community?' (walton on tv) 'well, you see, that's why we have a charity' we take ten percent of, of all the proceeds we make from page industries 'and we devote it to familial charities in need.' as a matter of fact, this is our latest and greatest project right over here. He's amazing. Jamie kassman? Zack becker? Whoa. I was wondering when I saw the name. Hoping actually. - Right this way. - Okay. So this is where you landed after vanderton. I took a travel year and then here, yeah. I wasn't surprised to hear you became senior debate team captain after I left. Someone had to uphold your high standard. You were untouchable. So I reviewed your resume very impressive. Thank you. Unfortunately jobs are few and far between these days even with a college diploma but I think I might have something that's perfect for you. In management? Actually, it's, um it's a nanny job. [sighs] are you kidding me? This nanny job will be different. It's our top client. It's a very big deal. The client is particular about their employee's background. Yours hits hard, it's a perfect match. You don't even know if I like kids. Well, do you like kids? Sure. Most. Jamie, look, I get it, okay? Trust me, I have been exactly where you are. But you gotta get creative I mean, you need to pay your rent, right? It's not a straight line anymore. And the money's really good. - Ah. - Oh. Fill out these forms and then we'll talk. Oh. Okay, ndas, background checks. What, are you gonna scan my retina? All of this for a temp job? A temp nanny job? Just fill out the forms, okay? And we'll be in touch. Okay. And the most important question is.. Yes? What are you doing Saturday night? [instrumental music] (jamie) 'park out back by the guest house.' [instrumental music] she's here, she's here. Hold up. Come this way. You must be the new girl. I'm annette and those monsters are gwyneth and madison. - And they're all yours. - Thank you. Okay. Which one of you is gwenny? I'm gwenny, I'm gwenny. Okay, if you show me around the house and tell me everything about yourself like your favorite animal and your favorite color then maybe, just maybe I'll tell you each a secret. [indistinct chatter] come on, come on. - Come on. - Jamie, come on. - Jamie, come on. - Okay. Come on. Look at my slippers. Those are my favorite slippers.

Goodnight. - Oh, hi. - Um.. - I'm so sorry. - Oh, hi, mr. Page.. Hi. No, call me walt, you must be jamie. Oh, sorry, walt. Oh, hey, listen, I really wanna thank you for the job that you're doing with the girls. - Fantastic. - Oh, thanks. It's nothing, really. I find that piggyback rides and tag are the ultimate draw with the under-eight crowd. You're right. [sighs] okay, I-I'm gonna go. Okay, look, if you don't have anything going on or if you don't have any plans, why don't you stay? I'd love to get better acquainted. - Really? - Uh, yeah. I have nowhere to go. - I mean, I, I would love to. - Fantastic. Well, why don't you have a seat by the fireplace? I'm gonna change real quick and be down in a few minutes. - Okay. - Alright. Great. I'll see you in a minute. So.. What do you do when you're not wrangling wild children? Well, I plan on taking my ivy league mba. Getting a job in management working my way up by working harder and being smarter than anyone else. Oh, yeah? And then I'll take my first vacation after I make the forbes under 25 list. Wow.

You need to leave. I'm not leaving till I find out what he did to my sister. Listen, I'm gonna call the police if you don't go right now. Just look. Look, please. I'm sorry. I don't know her. That's nanny mara! - Where did she go? - You need to go right now. Okay, you need to go or I'm calling the police. Get the girls inside the house, please. Where's my sister? Where'd she go? - 'inside the house.' - okay. Yeah. Where's my sister? I know you did something to her. I should ask you the same thing. - I know you did something. - Get back. She disappeared. She broke our contract. We can sue her. Buck. Mara talked about you. Tell me where she is! I'll tell you this. You come near me or my family again, I'll have you killed. Do you understand me?

Oh, yeah. No. Don't worry about that guy. He's nobody. The longer you're with me, you'll find that I've got more than my fair share of enemies. But that's why I keep buck around. He's a valuable deterrent. Actually, the reason why I wanted to you is because I have a business question. I was figuring that maybe we could stretch that resume of yours a bit, what do you say? Wanna give it a shot? Seriously? - Seriously. - Yes! Well, great, get over here. - Alright. - Alright. So there is this company called allister. Just filed for bankruptcy. You know it? Yes, I'm familiar. Foreign dealings, right? Yeah. Well, they were till about a week ago. So, you're gonna buy it? Oh, I already did that. Right before they declared. For ten cents on the dollar. [chuckles] I didn't know they were in trouble. Yeah, well, technically they weren't. But I saw their projections and I swooped in and made them an offer that they couldn't refuse. You see, jamie, in our line of work we don't wait for opportunities to present itself we create them and then we seize them. Always be one step ahead. Ah, that is right. Always be one step ahead. So, my question to you is.. 'have a seat.' - my question to you is.. - Oh. Now what? Um.. Well, depending on their standing holdings you could hold on to it collect off the dividends and interest but depending on their financials it might be more cost effective to divest break up all their holdings and sell it outright for a profit. Of course. Of course. Then what? Sell. Well, you know what? You are absolutely right. Sell is the right call. I put a seller order in first thing this morning. - That's very good. - Thank you. You're very welcome. - 'come on, nanny jamie!' - uh, that is definitely my cue. Yeah, indeed. Thank you for the business lesson. 'any time.' jamie. You're very impressive. That was very impressive. 'very bright future ahead of you.' - thanks. - 'you're welcome.' [seagulls squawking] you know, I, I can't believe zack becker asked me out. I can't believe jamie kassman said yes. You know, I used to think you were really cute in college. Too bad you aged so poorly. Right. Yeah. You look the same. But more. More.. More you. Which is amazing. Here's to reunions. And possibilities. ♪ baby I don't know why ♪ [instrumental music] ♪ when I said I love you ♪ ♪ I even made you cry ♪ - 'okay.' - 'alright.'

[laughs] I just, I like him so much. You guys always had a spark. I'm happy for you. You know, new job, new guy you're kind of rocking this adult thing right now. [sighs] I'm.. I'm not exactly rocking the job part. There's potential definitely but I still can't figure out walton page. Have you met his wife yet? Just in passing. She's never there. She's always at yoga or some charity event. - She seems.. - What? Unhappy. Which is crazy. Jamie, jamie, look at me. I mean, she's got great kids. Alright, let's see what you got. - Ha, ha, ha. - Oh, oh, oh. So close. (gwenny) 'wait, when we get inside we should play the floor is lava.' (madison) 'the floor is lava?

Don't touch me. [dramatic music] uh, I-I'm sorry, I didn't.. No. You.. Yeah, you're fine. We were, uh, just having a little conversation. Okay. Okay, sleepy.. [dramatic music] - huh! - 'that's our room.' - you lost? - Oh, no. I, um.. I just.. My wife and I, it's, uh.. It's been a little rough. Hey, you want a beer? Yeah. Great. Come on. Mm. My marriage is like a.. ...Never-ending performance art piece. - That sounds rough. - Oh, it's a mess. I'm sorry. You know, you remind me of sheryl actually. When I first met her. Yeah. She is ambitious, determined smart beyond your years. All engaging qualities. - Thank you, mr. Page. - Of course. I mean, it's so nice being around this youthful energy. You know, I mean, it's so, it's so light. Well, I could say the same thing about being here. You know, around you. Well, you could say we have a symbiotic relationship don't we? [laughs] well, yeah, I don't really see how it's even. You have all this experience and I'm just.. Intoxicating. ♪ the sun is shining brightly ♪ ♪ sure is gonna rain ♪ [instrumental music] I'm sorry. I have to go. He actually said that you were intoxicating? Mm-hm. Oh. Gosh, and, and I just.. I kept kissing him until I.. I just feel like such a fool. You know, I felt, like he actually believed that I was smart. He was just grooming me. He was testing me. He was testing my boundaries. And I, I didn't even stop him. No, he was your idol. And you're fresh out of college. This is on him. I just want to learn from him and all he wanted was-- he's a creep. [dramatic music] I'm so disappointed. What are you gonna do? Well, part of me just wants to crawl up into a hole and forget about all this, but.. Oh. I know this look. I like this look. Walton page says "opportunity is something you create. Not something you sit back and passively wait for.." so, you're gonna.. I'm gonna make it work. I mean, I can't afford to walk. So, for now, I'll forgive but I won't forget. I won't let him get in my head or touch me ever again. You know, I'm gonna beat him at his own game. I'm gonna get my power back. You first. - Almost - so close. - Oh. - Hi, girls. - Whoa! - Mom, you're home. - Mwah. - I missed you. I missed you. Oh, you must be jamie, the amazing nanny. - She really is. - She's so good. - I'm sheryl. - Mrs. Page. It's nice to finally meet you. Pleasure's mine. Well, hello, ladies. - Hi, dad, come play with us. - Hi. Hi, guys, I can't. I can't, I can't right now but maybe later, okay? Hi. (annette) 'dinner in your office, sir.' yes, that'll be great. Thank you, annette. Uh, mrs. Page, can I ask you a question? Sure. The girls were looking for their soccer stuff I was wondering if I could check in the garage for it? Of course. Come on, girls, let's go try on your new pair of clothes. - Whose bag is whose? - Go, go, go. This is mine. Annette, can I have a moment, please? Yes, sir. Thank you. Ms. Kassman. Mr. Page. Do we have a problem? No, we do not. But I do have boundaries, mr. Page. Understood. Do we have an understanding? We have an understanding. [car alarm beeps] "jamie, so you and I will always be in sync. "to a great future together. Respectfully, w.P." [chuckles] okay. Hm. So, not a creep? No. I mean, not a creep. I actually, uh, I feel kinda bad for him. He seems sort of lost. Walton page? Well, he's just a man in a complicated marriage. He's lonely. I think that's it, claire. I think he's just lonely. Well, he better not touch my best friend. Oh, he won't. We have an understanding. [crickets chirping] [instrumental music] [choking] jamie! Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I.. I've got it, I've got it under control. I'm okay. [sighs] [laughing] girls, it's time for your piano lesson. I can get them ready, annette. It's fine. I got it. Hey, girls. Girls, tell ms. Klein to teach you a little rock and roll this week. Daddy! We're only on scales on "twinkle twinkle." you serious? Alright, rock and roll next week then. Beat it. - Right. - Okay. Have a good time, ladies. - Alright. - Okay. Hey, jamie, can I have a word with you for a sec? - I really should go. - Just take a minute. [instrumental music] have a seat. [walton laughs] okay. Is that better? - Uh.. - No? More? More? I mean, I can go put it in the pool house if you want me to. Hm? Ha, ha. Sit down. Okay. I just wanna check in with you. I would imagine that you've got your, uh your resume floating around a few places? What do you mean? Well, as much as I'd like to have you here with the girls forever. I'd imagine that you're looking for a place to stretch that big bad business brain of yours. - I am. - 'yeah?' 'how's that goin'?' truthfully, discouraging. Yeah? You know what, I can, uh, I can make some calls. - Oh, really? - You kidding me? Of course. I'm tired of winning all these accolades and awards like they actually have some real competition for a change. Well, thank you, mr. Page. Yeah. Of course, here, let me. Oh, uh, I am, uh, I'm fine. - You don't have to. - Nah, you're getting burnt. Please, I do this with all my girls. - All your girls? - Mm-hm. Including sheryl? - Your wife? - Yes. Including sheryl, my wife. As we both know, she's, uh, pretty sustainable these days. - Mr. Page! - I'm sorry. Did I cross the line? Look, knee-jerk reaction. You know what? I saw you were getting burned. I figured I'd help you out. You know, I'm closing that allister deal tomorrow. I invite you to come sit in on the call. What do you say? See you tomorrow. Hey. You good? Yeah. Why? I don't know. You seem.. What? Off. Frustrated. Sad? Come on, jamie. You're my best friend. Just spill. Look, there's nothing to say. Walton has influence everywhere. And a letter of recommendation from him would mean everything to me. Well, it's not worth your mental anguish. It's not like he crossed a line. Really? What's that supposed to mean? I don't understand what you're doing. I'm trying to survive, claire. So what, you're just gonna hang around until he does cross the line? You're not that naive, jamie. I mean, this doesn't sound like you. You're a warrior. No, I'm just trying to navigate this, claire. Look, I can try to tough it out but I'm so outside of my comfort zone right now and I really just need some support.

But it was more. Yeah. You know, mr. Page, he.. Hey, look, I know that you signed an nda and I don't wanna compromise you. But if it helps, we can talk about it just refer to your feelings and generalities, okay? So, you can give me advice. As my boyfriend, right? Sure.. And as far as the watch goes feel free to graciously return it along with any other gift that makes you feel.. ...Inappropriate. [laughs] yeah. Okay. That's a very good idea. So, I'm your boyfriend, huh? Well.. Okay, well, as my girlfriend I think it's time we get some coffee to cheer you up. [dramatic music] [instrumental music] [door opens] morning, everyone! Morning, jamie. Too chunky. Oi. What's wrong? Oatmeal. Gross oatmeal? I love oatmeal. - Here you go. - Breakfast is served. Annette, do you have any left over? No. I just gave the last of it to the girls. It's organic and it's very good for them. Fine. Whatever. Ugh. I really love organic oatmeal. Please! She really, really, really wants it. - She's so hungry. - 'fine.' girls, give jamie your oatmeal, and I'll make you some eggs. Mm. Get it away. No, no. And I'm not blind, ms. Kassman. I see everything. Lucky for you, those girls are adorable and you are due in the office.. Thank you, annette! [mouths] go. (man on phone) 'so, the other issue was the foreign sales contract..' yeah, well, I put slattery on that so it should be taken care by this evening. (man on phone) 'the other point we wanted to discuss' 'was moving the sale up to this month instead of January.' yeah, I mean, I really don't see that being an issue 'as long as the comps remain the same..' actually, uh, hold on one second I need to consult with my, uh, my business associate. (man on phone) 'who's that, jacobs?' actually, no, gentleman, I'd like to introduce you to my latest discovery ms. Jamie kassman. (man on phone) 'pleasure, ms. Kassman.' hello, gentlemen. If mr. Page assumes ownership within the fiscal year then it's assumed he would also be inheriting your size-able debt to the irs, correct? (man on phone) 'correct.' whereas, if he takes ownership after the first of the year then it would be your contract to settle that debt, correct? Gentlemen? I mean, if you'd like to terminate this deal I'm sure that we won't have a problem finding another buyer. (man on phone) 'no. No.' - 'we're fine to proceed.' - lovely. (man on phone) 'I'll get the final agreements to jacobs.' okay, sounds like a plan. Ms. Kassman, is there anything else you'd like to add? Well, it's been a pleasure doing business with you. [chuckles] indeed it has. Fellas, we will, uh, we will send these contracts over to you asap. Thank you so much. Oh, my gosh. That was amazing. You were amazing. That was incredible. - It was incredible. - Oh. - 'walton!' - what? You really crossed the line. I.. [dramatic music] oh, my god, jamie, what are you.. Are you okay? Yes, no, no, I, I need to give my notice.. Honey, just a minute, wait a second. Stop. Annette? Annette! Jamie has some things to take care of. Can you cover the girls for today? Yes, mrs. Page. I can handle it. Okay. Now listen.. ...Why don't you take a girl's day. Collect yourself and come back fresh tomorrow. Okay? I'll see you tomorrow. Um, but, mrs. Page.. (sheryl) 'I'll see you tomorrow.' [phone ringing] (jamie) 'zack, it's jamie.' 'something really weird happened at work today.' [instrumental music] oh. Hey, stranger. Hello. Oh, sorry about that. Um, well, I went in and killed it on this conference call I was having one of the greatest moments of my life and then.. I'm sensing a but coming.. Well, and then walton grabbed me, kissed me and.. What? Are you okay? I mean, what, what did you do? Well, no, I, I got the hell out of there but on the way out, I ran into sheryl of all people, who just grabbed my hands told me to collect myself and just come back tomorrow. You didn't tell her? I wanted to but she just steam rolled past the moment. It's like she was very versed in having these kinds of pep talks. Anyway, I'm just trying to decode this contract I signed. Hey, can't zack help? I mean, didn't he make you sign this in the first place? He didn't make me sign it. It was just his job to give it to me. And I mean, if I talk to anyone about walton, the family or the company.. I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in court. - To anyone, or just-- - pretty much anyone. Lawyers, press, associates of the company. This sucks. I did make a list of pros and cons. Yeah? What's it telling you to do? You know, find that loophole find a way to win. Well, you do have someone on the inside who really seems to like you. Well, walton page is officially my least favorite person. I'm so sorry getting you involved. I don't care if he is the most powerful man on the planet. He cannot get away with this. Except.. Except what? It looks like he can. I mean, I'm not a lawyer, but these are pretty ironclad. I just want my life back. [glass shatters] are you okay? [instrumental music] [keys clacking] [beeps] [dramatic music] [chuckles] [instrumental music] hi. Uh, can I have a word with you? Yeah, of course. Please, come in. I'm glad that you came back. I, uh.. I wasn't sure that you would after happened yesterday. Mr. Page.. We should talk. We should. Have a seat. So.. ...What's the proposal? [chuckles] how did you-- well, I realized yesterday after I kissed you that I crossed the line. And I knew that there would be repercussions. So it won't surprise you to know that I want a new job. With a sizable raise. I want an executive position at the company. I'm aiming for operations chief but I understand that might ruffle a few feathers so I'd be willing to accept operations assistant. Okay. A demand as well as a compromise. It's, uh, it's pretty slick. Well-played. I've considered this thoroughly. And if I don't wanna negotiate? First, I go to sheryl then your most conservative shareholders and then I find a very visible lawyer. One that loves press. [chuckles] wow. You have thought this through, haven't you? Alright, well.. Good for you. You've come to play. Cheers. So.. ...Is this negotiating coming from you and you alone? Of course. Scout's honor? I never was a scout. Okay, well, I assume that you'd be interested in the numbers. [dramatic music] how does this number sound? [laughs] whoa. Wha.. - 'seriously?' - seriously. You've done nothing but impress me I would be an idiot not to bring you on to my company. So what do you say? Um.. - You have a deal. - Have a deal. [laughs] cheers. Hm. Negotiating can be fun. And to show you my gratitude I have a little something for you. Oh. [instrumental music] [chuckles] this is beautiful. It's tradition. I surrender. You win. Congratulations. Okay. Feel good? [sighs] yeah. - Okay. - Okay. Um, okay, so I will finish my two weeks give you time to find a replacement uh, and then, you can, you can prepare for my.. - My new.. - Your new position? Uh, yes. - You okay? - Uh.. Yeah, sorry, I just.. Um.. Jamie? [dramatic music] [grunting] - oh! - Whoa, hey! You're burning. You're high. Uh, come on. Come, come on. Come on. Let go. Ah ah ah. No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on, come on. - Don't. - Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. You, come on. [grunting] [dramatic music] - look, officer dallas, I-- - no, you look, ms. Kassman. (officer dallas) even if we test your blood, there's no proof mr. Page allegedly drugged you. (jamie) wait a minute, is that a picture of you and mr. Page? (officer dallas) mr. Page is a fine upstanding citizen. And I don't know you. Good day, ms. Kassman. Officer dallas took a report. Well, it'll probably get lost. I mean, he kept using the word allegedly with me. I mean, how do you allegedly drug someone? You don't. So let's go to a hospital and get a blood test. What's the point? It won't do anything. Walton will just say someone else drugged me. Oh but this is actually the best part. So I'm waiting to fill out my paperwork I look up at the wall with all the plaques awards and pictures and guess whose there right front and center? - Walton page? - Yep. Holding a big check, shaking the hand of the chief of police. Fifty thousand dollars to the police pension fund. [instrumental music] [grunting] ah, you good? Uh, uh, hey. [panting] [birds chirping] so, how are you feeling? [sighs] like I blew up my life and got hit by a bus. What can I do? I don't know, maybe this is what he meant when he said everything has a price. God, I just never wanna see that face again. Okay, let's focus on a solution, not the problem. So what are you gonna do next? I don't know, he's the walton page and I'm me so.. No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, come on. Come on. You're a fighter. You can think of something. Just think of someone who will believe you, and has leverage. Um.. Okay, yeah. Uh.. Sheryl. She's really hard to read but maybe she'll hear me out. I know she knows. [dramatic music] - sheryl! - Jamie. W-where are the girls? Are they okay? Ah, they're fine. You obviously haven't spoken to your husband. [scoffs] I rarely speak to my husband. Uh-oh. What now? Mr. Page.. He tried to.. - I don't know.. - Le-let's get some coffee. I'll be right back. Come on. [sheryl sighs] 'and after cornell' I was on my way to be running a fortune 500 company. I got my mba at london business school to seal the deal. [sighs] and then, I met walton. He was charismatic and funny. And I fell for him. But then suddenly my dreams of becoming a business magnate were replaced by supporting his dreams. Well, do you have any regrets? Every day. - Except for the girls. - Right. I was seduced figuratively and literally. First by him, but then by the prospect of the life he promised. Every day, we felt less like a couple and more like a.. [dramatic music] ...Partnership. And then one day I realized the love was gone. Why? You could just leave, right? Walton made it very clear that if I do leave it will be without the girls. Well, mothers don't lose their kids. Yeah, well this is mr. Walton page we're talking about this is not an option. But I have to do something. Cleary, he's threatened by you which is not a place you want to be. Trust me. I've been there. Well, what are you saying? Just give up? Madison and gwenny are the best things in my life. And I will never leave them. Can you help me at least? You're not hearing me. If I go against walton, he will take my girls from me. You really have forgotten how to fight. Haven't you? Well, I haven't. I almost died, sheryl. Your husband almost killed me. I will not give up. I refuse to let him take my life away. I won't become another you. Excuse me. [instrumental music] claire? Claire, you can't just leave the door.. Claire? Claire? Is anybody here? [instrumental music] this isn't funny. Claire, are you back there? [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [line ringing] (sheryl on phone) 'you've got sheryl. 'leave a message.' sheryl? It's, it's jamie, jamie kassman. My apartment's been ransacked. You can probably guess by who. Um, what's, what's next? Oh, my god. Jamie, I am so sorry I wasn't here. They wouldn't let me leave. No, I, he's everywhere. Not actually, but my brain is playing tricks on me. And I, I'm so paranoid. Okay, listen, I called a pre-law pal of mine and he did some digging and it turns out page has had some other harassment complaints against him. Yeah, that doesn't surprise me at all. Apparently, the last one was someone named mara jackson. Wait, I-I, um, uh, I know that name. Her brother came to look for her. Ryan. Oh, gosh, I-I feel like such an idiot. I should have seen this before. But I was so caught up in getting ahead and trying to learn from him. Stop. There's no way you could have seen this coming. Okay, look, there are six ryan jacksons. Which one is he? - You're a genius. - Hm. - It's this one. - Okay. - What are you doing? - Direct messaging him on insta. It'll be the fastest. And in the meantime we can find the others. The others? Yes. This is a list of all of his other nannies. Oh, jeez, that's a lot. Yeah, and they all have profiles like yours. Recent business grads and top of their ivy league class. It looks like walton page has a type. She loved working for that lunatic. I told her she was being obsessive and she reminded me that she signed an nda and shouldn't be talking to me about it anyway. - What happened? - We got into a huge fight. Page came between us. What, did he do something to her? Honestly, I don't know. I only saw her a few times after that but she was moody and refused to talk about him. 'she looked stressed out.' scared even. Then she disappeared. All I got is this. And they found this red trampled-on scarf in the stairwell at his office nothing on social media. Her landlord said she hadn't been home in weeks. I had to clear out her stuff. Mara was at top of her class. She was going places. I'm sure she's okay. I don't know what to do. The cops don't believe me. They won't even look into it. The same thing happened to jamie. And now page has a restraining order out against me. I can't get near him. [phone buzzes] maybe I can. Sheryl just texted me back. Maybe she is finally going to help. [instrumental music] uh, I was expecting-- oh, my wife, she's, she's indisposed at the moment unfortunately. I wanna leave. I understand. Look, I'd like to resolve this as, as quickly as possible. Why don't you come on in? Really, it's early, kids are up. We're hanging out. Please, come on in. Drink? No? [sighs] so.. What do we need to do to make our little misunderstanding disappear? - Excuse me? - Well, that little thing. That happened between you and I. Just give me a number, any number. You drugged me. Hm. Yeah. Says you. Or I could say that you had a little too much to drink and then when I tried to help you you assaulted me. There's no one else here, mr. Page you can stop lying. I'm not lying. You're lying. That's the point. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna make sure you stop victimizing women. [chuckles] victimizing women. Okay. Well, how are you gonna do that? I've got proof. There are others. The whole nanny merger thing that you're working on. - That's cute. - I'm just getting started. You really think that I'm gonna let you take me down? I've covered all of my bases. You should quit while you're ahead. What's that supposed to mean? It means that you're gonna lose. It means that you have no one. I've got ryan, mara's brother. Ryan, you mean that guy that trespassed on my property? That crazy guy? His thief of a sister. Yeah. There's a warrant out for her arrest. I have your own wife-- who delivered you right here to me. See, jamie.. ..You have no power. - 'what do you got?' - I have the truth. Oh, really? I got a version of the truth too? Here, check it out, these contracts that you signed to bankrupt you and your entire family for the rest of your life. So we can either go that route or you could graciously accept the severance package that I'm offering you and you could walk out of here with more money than you have ever had your entire life. If I can be bought, then where will I even be in 20 years? You know what, everybody's got their price, ask my wife. - I'm done with you. - Goodbye, mr. Page. [gasps] you're not going anywhere. Understand? (gwenny) 'daddy?' [grunts] - hi, sweetheart. - I can't sleep. Oh, I'm so sorry. I need you to go back in the house. Okay? I'll be up in a few minutes. I'll tuck you in. She promised to read the blue bunny story. Okay, listen, baby, you know what nanny jamie and I are talking, I need you to go to bed-- how about I read you the story? Honey, I need you to go to bed. - What did I just say? - She said that-- - what did I just say? - She said-- - what did I tell you? - I promised her. I promised her I'd read her a story. Come on. [gwenny sobs] [dramatic music] alright. Sleep tight. [dramatic music] (walton) I'm gonna kill you. [dramatic music] jamie. Nanny jamie. [panting] damn it, I'm blocked. [sighs] - here? - 'yes.' go. [car door closes] hey, jamie. I've talked to the women but they all signed ndas no one will talk. I'm just leaving the construction site now. Ryan? I need to talk to you. Hey, hey, hey. Look, look. I need to talk to you. I, I understand why you wouldn't trust me but your sister, I made a lot of mistakes with her as well. Listen, I know where she is, I can take you there. [dramatic music] [indistinct chatter] [grunts] [dramatic music] [grunting] I feel like a steak. Ryan. I got your message. Have you had a chance to talk to linda yet? Nothing but dead ends for me and claire but we're not giving up. Call me. (man on tv) 'right, right, right.' 'and so what's your best advice' 'for young kids today?' (walton on tv) 'well, I think the major problem today' is that everyone keeps lowering the bar. I mean, I don't understand when we started just being okay with mediocrity? I mean, you have to reach, you have to strive you gotta, you gotta grab hold of that brass ring 'you never let it go.' zack, I need a new job. I know, but, the thing is, we-- look, if it's about being overqualified I told you I am fine starting anywhere. Jamie, it's not that. Your file has been flagged. What's that supposed to mean? On the record? There have been.. ...Issues in your previous placements. Issues, they go by the name of walton page? I'm not at liberty to say. You're not at liberty to say? What, what can you tell me? You don't understand what it's like for me to be over there. This morning, I had to get my car back and I was completely freaked out. I could lose my job. Zack, it's me. Okay? Please. This, this is my life. Walton page has specifically stated he will not use our company if we employ you in our services. Jamie, wait.. [sighs] [lock clicks] I'm sorry, can I help you? Yeah, you can. [grunts] he's blackballing me! He doesn't own the entire town. (jamie) 'yes. He does.' no one in town will touch me. Have you heard anything from ryan? I sent him a text and left him a message but.. ...Nothing. You don't think walton got to him, do you? I don't know. I mean, he's got eyes and ears everywhere. So what do we do? We have to take him down. Ooh. You're gonna take me down. How are you gonna do that, jamie? Hm? Fresh popcorn, sir? No. Annette, get the girls ready. I'm gonna pay ms. Kassman a little visit. [doorbell rings] [laughing] - nanny jamie! - Nanny jamie! I've missed you so much! I missed you too. - Yeah. We brought ice cream. - Yeah. - Let's go eat it. - Go eat it. Mr. Page. Mind if I come in? Or is your boyfriend, zack here? (walton) 'cute place.' why did you come here? Oh, well the girls missed you. I missed you. You have a funny way of showing it. Blacklisting me all over town. [laughing] that's nothing personal. - It's just business. Right? - Yeah. It is just business. And you, my dear, are bad business. [dramatic music] hm. Well.. Such a beautiful family. They're still in iowa, right? 'your dad, still on the insurance business.' 'he had a good year last year.' hell, I'm impressed. Gosh, your mother, erin, she looks so beautiful in this picture. And she must be so proud 'of your little brother justin' 'for making varsity, that is' a hell of an accomplishment. Hey, is he still into old cars? Is he still driving the '72 chevy pickup? I love old cars myself but you gotta be careful because, you know, things wear out. Things become dangerous. - Brakes stop working. - Why did you come here? I came here to remind you.. - 'we should come here often.' - 'yeah, we should.' ...That you are a little minnow. And I am a great white shark. And that minnows don't last very long. I need you to stop poking around I need you to leave it alone do you understand me? Say yes. Say yes. Girls. Finish up, it's time to go. Okay. (walton) 'say goodbye to jamie. Okay?' - bye, nanny jamie. - Bye. Bye. (walton) 'come on, guys.' hey, uh, jamie? Give my regards to zack, okay? Wish him a speedy recovery. - Bye, jamie. - Bye, jamie. Yeah. - 'bye, nanny jamie.' - 'bye.' (walton) 'bye.' [dramatic music] [line ringing] (nurse mckay on phone) 'hello, this is nurse mckay' 'mccounty general, how can I help you?' [indistinct chatter on pa] [beeping] how's he doing? Well, he was touch and go for awhile there. We're all just hoping that he regains consciousness. He had a lot of internal bleeding. Is there.. Is there anything I can do? Just keep him company. From what I understand, his parents are overseas and that's gonna be a day or two before they get here. You're his best medicine right now. [indistinct chatter over pa] I'm so sorry.. Come on. Wake up. [inhales] zack, I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. I mean, it's all over my head and I dragged you into it I'm so sorry. I'll make this all go away. But you have to wake up, okay? You just gotta wake up. [instrumental music] rough night? What are you doing here? You either stop talking or everyone you care about will disappear. Even zack. If he makes it out alive. Anything can happen in a hospital. Be a good little girl and stop making noise. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] sheryl! You have to help me. Your husband threatened me again and my family! Buck beat my boyfriend into a coma! - I'm not the first person-- - are you insane? I know you know. I can see it in your eyes. You are playing with fire. Leave me alone. I mean it. You are jeopardizing me and my girls. Well, he's ruined lives, sheryl. Many women just like you and me. You are smart. Okay? You can stop this. You can help. You're all I have. I need to keep my girls. They're everything to me. Look, I know that. And I can help. I just.. Look, sheryl, we can do this. Together. He's gonna kill someone, sheryl. Don't you wanna be free? [instrumental music] (woman on tv) 'we're live here at los angeles county' [indistinct chatter on tv] '...Where proceeds will go to the city's homeless.' 'walton page and his wife sheryl..' wait, claire! Claire, I have an idea. Is this an "uh-oh" idea? Or a "yay, ice cream?" oh, whatever. Okay, I'm game for anything. Come on. Let's go. We gotta change. - Come on, come on, come on. - Okay, okay, okay. - We have to hurry. - I'm going, I'm going. Okay, where do we go? We're gonna go right through the side door. Security camera's broken. Okay. [instrumental music] [music continues] okay. Gotta find something on him. Okay? Just look for anything, anything that looks important any documents, keep a note he knows exactly how he leaves things. Okay, we've gotta find proof of money that he sent to women or contracts that he used to silence them. [sighs] hey. These look pretty official. Okay. I'm just gonna copy all of his files, look at 'em later and see if I can find any proof of payoffs. What's this? - 'what the hell?' - 'oh, my god. What the hell?' (jamie) 'claire, this is live.' he's in our house right now? Yeah. Yeah. They're not here. [door unlocks] someone's coming. It's annette, quick. Under here. [instrumental music] (jamie) I can't believe he's been watching us all this time. (claire) you don't think he'll still be there, do you? (jamie) buck? No. I saw him leave, right? (jamie) 'when you heard annette coming.' 'and the police won't listen to us.' 'we're on our own.' - you have the usb? - Yeah, I got it. - Do you have the folder? - Yeah. [instrumental music] seriously, I know you don't believe me but I'm telling you the truth. It's really, really funny. - Sheryl. - Hey. Uh, buck is tracking you. Look, I found something on walton that can help free the both of us. You need to get out of here. - Just take this. - No, I.. I need your help. [phone rings] (claire on voicemail) 'you've reached claire. Leave a message.' claire, okay call me back as soon as you can. [sighs] [grunts] [screams] [dramatic music] [tires screeching] claire! Claire. Oh, my gosh. What happened to you? Claire! Behind you! Ah! Jamie! Shut up. Jamie! Just shut up. (buck) 'come on.' [whimpers] [instrumental music] [sighs] she locked me out.

[sighs] I think we're in page's office somewhere. - I don't know. - Are you okay? Hey. You're not gonna get away with this. He's a lunatic, he's a monster. (walton) he's what? Hi. Take this one outside, we need to use her for insurance in case this one here doesn't cooperate. No. No. Come on. Ugh. - Wait. - No. (claire) 'jamie.' - okay. Where are my files? - I don't know. [laughs] [sighs] I really need you to give me back what belongs to me or we're gonna have a big problem do you understand? Is this what happened with mara? No. It's not happened with mara. She was a lot worse. See, mara was a bright girl.. Well, all my girls.. [chuckles] my girls. Because I love smart women. But you.. You were my biggest disappointment. I could have schooled you I could have molded you. I could have taken you all the way to the top. [chuckles] [sighs] such a pity. You brought this on yourself. Time for us to go. Just like mara, just like ryan. It's time.. [groans] [groans] [sighs] [grunting] whoo! Hey, where are you going? [grunting] [whistling] look, okay.. You broke our contract. I'll do anything you want. You'll do anything I want? Give me my files. (sheryl) 'hello, darling.' 'looking for this.' ah. Hey. Okay. Oh, it took me too many years to remember who I was. You were right, jamie. What are you doing? We're a husband and wife. Till death do us part. Why don't you shut up, walton? Do you know what your problem is? You think so highly of yourself that you have managed to underestimate everyone else. And when I saw all those video tapes of all those nannies that you blackmailed and attacked guess what? Your little wife here got smart and I got my own camera and I started recording you. That's right. Oh. Oh, you see it? We all know how much you love the camera, honey. So why don't you give the police a nice big smile because they're recording you right now. Ooh. That feels good. Come on, baby, let me see those pearly whites. Ha. How does it feel? Come on. Smile. [siren wailing] [indistinct chatter] found all your secret holdings. Shady business deals. Literally, where the bodies are buried. Your shareholders won't be happy. And neither is your wife.
