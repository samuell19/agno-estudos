And that guy Nick? He thinks he's all like, look at me, I'm so beautiful. &gt;&gt; Lisa: I think he's kind of cute. &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: No, no. I mean, he's kind of hot, but he's not God's gift.

But I knew, I knew he was looking right at me. So then we start talking about the. [LAUGH] I don't know, it was really silly. And I'm gonna just like, start talking about a lot of stuff. It was really nice. And then he asked me, well did you do the homework? And I said yeah. And he said, can i copy it? And I said yeah.

Otherwise, he's going to kill our whole family. Please, just be brave and choose me. &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Please, don't. &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Elliot: You got to. You got to. &gt;&gt; Lisa: Choose! &gt;&gt; Elliot: He's gonna kill us all if you don't. You can do it. &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: My mother. My mother. &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: What? &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Elliot: Please, come on. &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: My father, my daddy I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Elliot: Okay, that's okay. All right. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: And you will have to do the dirty work. &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: Pick it up! &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Elliot: You can do it, be brave, come on, it's me. &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: Your choices have ramifications, Daddy.

The two men, whose names are not being released yet, were last seen camping in the area of the lake. Investigators said a canoe was missing from the shoreline. The sheriff's department and the New York state police are helping in the search. We have a crew headed to the scene and we'll bring you more information as it becomes available. &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Thank you, Sandy. Do you like hot dogs, roasted corn, funnel cake, and cotton candy? Who doesn't? Well, you're in luck. The annual Hogwash Festival returns this week in with fun in store for the whole family. The festivities kick off- &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: The victim was 57 year old defense attorney Elliot Simpson. Police sources say that suspects bound and gagged Vincent and his wife. Then they say that suspects made Vincent's teenage daughter choose which parent should die, threatening to kill the entire family if she didn't. Police described the alleged killer as a Caucasian male, approximately six feet tall, wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and knit cap. Vincent was best known for his role in the highly publicized Wilshire-Barrett case. That case involved alleged sexual abuse in several state-run correctional facilities throughout the county. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] [MUSIC] [SOUND] [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Aah! &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: What the hell's the matter with you? &gt;&gt; Fiona: You scared the shit out of me! &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Well, you left your door open! Are you okay? &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: And you're certain that the door was locked? &gt;&gt; Fiona: Positive, I had just checked it. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Okay, cuz there's no sign of forced entry. &gt;&gt; Fiona: So you don't believe me? &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: I'm not saying that. &gt;&gt; Fiona: The door was locked. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Ever since this article came out, had like 50 phone calls down at the station, everybody in varying degrees of hysteria. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Oh, Dad. I know what you're thinking. Little Fiona, living all alone with an overactive reporter's imagination. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Easy, easy, okay? We'll dust for prints, we'll investigate, it's just, you want my gut on this? I think it's one of your stupid friends. &gt;&gt; Fiona: I don't have friends that will a prank like that. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Okay, what about Paul? &gt;&gt; Fiona: He's harmless. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Okay, I give up. I'm sorry, I'll take it more seriously. In fact, why don't you sleep at home tonight? &gt;&gt; Fiona: [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: For security reasons. Popcorn, old movies. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Dad. I lost the pigtails years ago. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; Fiona: I'm getting my Masters in June. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Not if I talk to your professors and they agree to flunk you. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Just dust for prints. Please? &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Okay. Let's talk about this for a moment, though. The scanner you're not supposed to have. &gt;&gt; Fiona: I know. I just like to keep track of people. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Of me. Not on your next story, big headlines. &gt;&gt; Fiona: All you, all the time. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: All right. Then clearly, you won't mind that I dusted it for prints, because as you mentioned. Geez, hold on. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Go for Wagner. Yeah. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Ouch. Okay, yeah. I have to go. Take this for prints. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Is everything all right? &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Yeah, everything's fine, just a domestic disturbance kind of thing. I'll, I'll see you soon. &gt;&gt; Paul: My mom would get the axe. She spends every dime of my inheritance without my old man keeping tabs on her. &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: I don't know, I guess my Dad. Or shit, maybe my mom. You know what, forget this. I don't even want to think about it. &gt;&gt; Paul: What about you Fiona, which one would you choose? &gt;&gt; Fiona: You are such a dumbass. &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Hello? &gt;&gt; Paul: Shit, I spaced it, I'm sorry, Fi. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Oh, look at that. Not having a mom has its advantages. &gt;&gt; Paul: How about this one? You have to sleep with that guy or me, choose. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Hm, tough one. &gt;&gt; Brian: I feel your pain. &gt;&gt; Paul: You have to choose, you have a gun to your head. &gt;&gt; Fiona: I don't, and I won't. &gt;&gt; Paul: Choose. &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Jesus, Paul, back off, why don't ya? &gt;&gt; Paul: I'm just kidding, God. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Look guys, I gotta go. &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Well, South Bat tonight? &gt;&gt; Fiona: No, I don't know, I gotta finish my paper. &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Yeah, blah, blah, blah. Just get your ass there, okay? Idiot! &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] [BLANK_AUDIO] [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; David: Little less staccato in that last measure. Otherwise, very nice, bravo I will see you all one hour before the performance tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: David, would it be all right if I hang back for a while and run through it on my own? &gt;&gt; David: By all means. Coming along nicely by the way. &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Late bloomer I guess. &gt;&gt; David: [LAUGH] Mind the house lights when you leave. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: [APPLAUSE] &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Hello? Who's there? Thank you. I was just leaving. Sorry, oh. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Hello? I just wanted to practice the end but I'm done so it's fine. I. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: David, is that you? Hello? &gt;&gt; [SOUND] [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Hey, stop screwing around. &gt;&gt; [SOUND] [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Hey. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: I'm still in here. Come on, open up. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Who is that? &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: I'am sorry. I'm a member of the orchestra. It's okay for me to be here. I mean I'm just David's friend. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Just, take the money. &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: I don't want your money, son. I am going to take something. Much more dear to you than that. Either you lose the ability to hear, or you lose the ability to play. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Help. &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: Stop this way. &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Okay. &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: And get on your knees. &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Okay. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: Choose, your hearing or your fingers? &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: I have five senses. &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: You have 60 seconds to decide. What's it gonna be? Five fingers. But, you have one more choice to make. All at once or one at a time? Choose! This. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Aah! &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Aah! &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: ISO 17. ISO 17. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] [SOUND] [BLANK_AUDIO] [SOUND] [MUSIC] [SOUND] [BLANK_AUDIO] [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Speaker 23: Hey, no sleeping in here! God damn it. How'd you even get &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Speaker 23: Shit. &gt;&gt; Al: So, the janitor found the poor bastard passed out on the staircase. No witnesses, no security cameras. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Great, what else? &gt;&gt; Al: Looks like we got a pattern. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: That's blood. &gt;&gt; Al: From crime scene last night. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: That's a match. Where's the victim? &gt;&gt; Al: Hospital. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Show me where they found him. How bad is it? &gt;&gt; Al: He'll live. I'm not sure how much he's gonna want to. Snipped off all his fingers and made sure they couldn't be sewn back on. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Shit. &gt;&gt; Al: Yeah, that's the symbol that I told you about. Already got Jamie on it. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Christ Almighty. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: For matching fingers. &gt;&gt; Speaker 22: Sheriff Wagner, follow me. Sheriff Wagner, any comments for the evening news? &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: No. &gt;&gt; Speaker 22: Come on, Tom. Throw me a bone, here. &gt;&gt; Al: Your kid wants to join their ranks? Good times. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Sources close to the investigation say the attacker forced the victim to choose between losing his hearing or losing his fingers. How does a person do something like that? You know, personally I think I'd rather lose my hearing and be deaf than lose my fingers, but the guy was a pianist so pretty raw deal either way, right? Hello? What is with you? You're acting all weird, are you okay? &gt;&gt; Fiona: If I tell you something, do you promise not to think I'm crazy? &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Forget about it. &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: No, tell me. &gt;&gt; Fiona: No really, let's just drop it. &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Dee. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: In her note, my mom talked about choices. And it never made sense. But what if someone made her choose? Choose between doing what she did or something else that was even more horrible. That would explain it, right? And it would make sense. &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Have you spoken to your father about this? &gt;&gt; Fiona: Oh God. I can't talk to him about this stuff. Last time I tried he totally freaked out on me. &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Maybe you should just try, Phi? Maybe you should just try. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: You're right. It's silly, I'm just being silly. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Mr Campbell? &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Not another one of you. I just want to get some sleep. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Of course. I understand. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Get on with it already. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Is there anything else you can think of that might help identify the guy who did this to you? &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: How many times do I have to go over this? It was dark. He had a flashlight in my eyes the whole time. I don't know who he was or how he knew my name. &gt;&gt; Fiona: He knew your name? &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: What else did he know about you? &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Nothing, I guess. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Did he say anything to you that stuck out or anything that you could think of that might have? &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: Something about choices and ramifications or something like that. I don't know. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: There must be a reason why he picked you. There must be a reason why he chose you. Can you think of anything? Do you know him? Have you ever met somebody that might do this to you or anything? Please, there must be a reason. &gt;&gt; Mr. Campbell: I just want to get some sleep. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] [SOUND] [MUSIC] [BLANK_AUDIO] [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay. &gt;&gt; Lisa: Okay, okay. No. &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Thank you. Try a little less [INAUDIBLE] &gt;&gt; Lisa: You got five photos? Frames. &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah look at. That's okay. Okay come on give me a nice smile. Just lean your head, there you go. &gt;&gt; Lisa: You know what I'm over this. I'm done, I'm done. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What an asshole. Let me see everything from the first camera right away just. Just forget about the other one for now, okay? &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Lisa: No, I just wrapped. A bullshit day, I know it. Well, I don't feel well. And listen, I need to eat, so if you don't mind putting in an order for me, that would be great. Yeah, I know. Baby, I know, but listen. Okay, fine! &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Hey, sorry. &gt;&gt; Lisa: What? &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I'm sorry. We're wrapped up so if you want- &gt;&gt; Lisa: Can't you see I'm on the phone here? Yeah, seriously. &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay. &gt;&gt; Lisa: Not a conversation for you. Get the fuck out of here. No, just some idiot. I'm sorry. No, don't be such a fucking asshole. No, I don't care. He just walked in here and eavesdropped my whole conversation. All right, yeah you better start thinking of me for a change, right? Yeah, okay. Yeah, well that's your opinion. I'll see you later. &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Lisa: If you wanna get laid tonight you better drop the fucking attitude. &gt;&gt; Lisa: What? Go away! &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Lisa: Listen, I'll be done when I'm done. Just give me a minute. &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Lisa: Are you fucking kidding me, what the? Listen you little shit, whatever the fuck your name is. If you expect to come back here tomorrow &gt;&gt; [SOUND]. &gt;&gt; Lisa: Hey, not funny. &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: I thought you loved the camera. &gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] &gt;&gt; Lisa: Who the fuck are you? You creepy fuck. &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: Sticks and stones will break your bones. &gt;&gt; Lisa: Don't touch me. Don't touch me. &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: Vain to the very end. Not afraid for your life just for your face. &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Lisa: Help I want to offer you a choice. You have 60 seconds to decide. What is more dear to you, bitch? Your eyesight or your beauty. You will either never be able to see yourself again, or the world will see what a miserable hag you really are. &gt;&gt; Lisa: No, no, please! &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: Now let me see those big, beautiful lips. &gt;&gt; Lisa: No, please! &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: The hourglass is handmade and I've timed it. It's exactly one minute, down to the fricking second. &gt;&gt; Lisa: Perfection is certainly keeping with the profile. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Hey Alice, my dad here? &gt;&gt; Lisa: Yeah, in his office. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: That's not two handmade hourglasses. They match perfectly to the last crime scene and now this one. We got zero fingerprints, zero hair. This guy's good, really good. I've never seen this level of expertise before. I'm just waiting on the DNA report from forensics, see if we can get anything on the blood. But, I just heard that Vick Simon Campbell's regained consciousness up at Covenant Hospital, so I'm gonna head over there and question him, all right? &gt;&gt; Lisa: And let me know if anything clicks with our piano man. Hey, Miss Pulitzer herself, how you doing? &gt;&gt; Fiona: Good, you? &gt;&gt; Lisa: Well you know, been worse, been better. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Hey. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Bad time? &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: No, no. Just promise me you'll never become one of these bottom feeders. &gt;&gt; Fiona: No comment. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: That's my line. The whole town's in a tizzy because there might be a mad man on the loose. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Well, isn't there? &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: It's a little early to be broadcasting that kind of hysteria. &gt;&gt; Fiona: So the crimes actually aren't connected &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: I'm not saying that. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Then there's a maniac on the loose. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Are we really having this discussion? You taking notes? God help the cops on your beat. Please, come in, sit down. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: I got a pop-up message this morning on my computer. Photographs of this woman tortured and burned. I think she might be dead. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Uh-huh. You know, that's terrible. I'm not saying it isn't, and I don't mean to downplay what you're going through here. It's just that it could be spam, it could be one of your stupid friends. &gt;&gt; Fiona: It had the same symbol, right there from that musician! Why didn't you tell me? &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Why didn't I tell you? That's classified information. Listen, I can't tell you everything, all right? There's this crazy little fuzzy line between being your father and being in charge of an investigation, not to mention your soon to be chosen profession. Don't give me that look. Your mother gave me that look. &gt;&gt; Fiona: You piss her off too? &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Quite regularly. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: What I wouldn't give for one of her looks right now. Oh Fi, she'd be so proud of you, all this nosing around. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Coming up on the anniversary, I know. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Right, it comes up so quick every year. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Aw, come on, Dad. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: There's a lot of stress in the office, in case you hadn't noticed. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Get your team to look at this. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: I will. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Please. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: I promise. Just promise me you're gonna stay away from this case. Okay, go, go, go, go already. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Told you she'd be a heartbreaker. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Yeah you did say something about that. Imagine if it was yours. Have forensics examine this hard drive, will you please. &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: We just got a call, it looks like we got another one. Photo studio, downtown. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Young woman, tortured, burned? &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Jesus, you're good. Where the fuck did you get that? &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Hello, are you coming out with us tonight? &gt;&gt; Fiona: [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: You know your doors open again. You got to get that fixed. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Yeah, I know. I'm kinda in the middle of something right now. &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Okay, fun or whatever the hell you're doing, it's your choice. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Oh god, it's gone viral already. Look, I'm sorry I'm in tonight, but thanks anyway. &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: All right, okay, suit yourself. But, will you just promise me you'll lock your door this time? &gt;&gt; Fiona: Yes, I'll lock the door, bye. &gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Okay, good-bye. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Hello? Hello? &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Anybody there? &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Lisa: Can I help you? &gt;&gt; Fiona: I'm sorry. I tried the office but no one answered. I was just leaving. &gt;&gt; Lisa: You're trespassing. I could call the cops, you know. But you, &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Lisa: You look like maybe you like to party. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Excuse me. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Lisa: You smell good. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Lisa: Like apples. I like apples. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Yeah? &gt;&gt; Lisa: You got &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Fiona: How you like them apples? &gt;&gt; [SOUND] [BLANK_AUDIO] [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Three, four, six. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Huh. &gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: I-C 6941.70 &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Paul God damn it! &gt;&gt; Paul: Little on edge? &gt;&gt; Fiona: A little. &gt;&gt; Paul: So you going to South Bend tonight or what? &gt;&gt; Fiona: I can't.

Well what I can tell you is, is that we have seven binary identifiers, a constant width module and an interweaving matrix. &gt;&gt; Fiona: English. &gt;&gt; Brian: It's bar code. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Yeah, I kinda got that far myself. Can you look it up? &gt;&gt; Brian: [COUGH] Yes, I can look it up. Just give me one second here. &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Brian: That's weird. &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Brian: No. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Brian: It's a codabar. This isn't current barcode. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Meaning? &gt;&gt; Brian: Meaning it's like old linear code used in libraries way before the digital age. Nobody uses this anymore. Where did you get these books? &gt;&gt; Fiona: Can you trace it? &gt;&gt; Brian: I can try. I really don't have much to work with here. I got nothing here. &gt;&gt; Fiona: You sure? &gt;&gt; Brian: Yep. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: The last four numbers look like the Dewey Decimal numbers. &gt;&gt; Brian: Holy shit. Who doesn't love a girl who knows the Dewey Decimal System? &gt;&gt; Fiona: Do you think the other numbers are a branch code, a city, a state or something? &gt;&gt; Brian: Maybe. It's not a bad idea. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Brian: Seven. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Brian: Milburn. &gt;&gt; Fiona: That's like a half hour from here. &gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, let's see. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Brian: The only problem is there are no libraries in Milburn. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Well, maybe it's a private school. An old folks home, or something else that has a library? &gt;&gt; Brian: I mean, it's a possibility but, I'm telling you. The only public institution I see here is Milburn Juvenile Detention, and that's about it. And it closed in 2000. Where the hell did you get these books from again? &gt;&gt; Fiona: Look up why they closed. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Brian: Whoa, holy shit. After extensive inquiries, charges were never filed, as the evidence was considered purely circumstantial. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Jesus. Does that look circumstantial to you? &gt;&gt; Brian: Absolutely not. The official story, the Milburn Guards were cleared of all charges. &gt;&gt; Fiona: But they closed the place anyway. &gt;&gt; Brian: Yep. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: These books are from there, he's from there. &gt;&gt; Brian: So are you talking about Mr Choose It? How the hell do you know that, Fi? &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Fiona: I just know. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Brian, thank you. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: So far the pattern is no pattern. Hundred miles apart, male, female, different jobs, lifestyles. The latest DNA check on the blood tells us what, Alice? &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Nothing matches the database so far, but the maze for Jenna Marlowe was drawn in Simon Campbell's blood. &gt;&gt; Lisa: If you're to know all of them, or at least new facts about them. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: That simply tells us that he stalked them. Well, we gotta start thinking about this in a whole new light. A different angle, different possibilities. Maybe the victim isn't the target. Case in point, young Sarah. What if she's the target instead of her father? She brings the killer to the family. She feels responsible, she takes her own life. &gt;&gt; Fiona: She was forced to kill her own father in front of her mother and brother. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: I'm simply suggesting that we examine this from. And by the way, when I say we, I'm of course referring to those of us involved in official police business. &gt;&gt; Fiona: It is my business. He keeps making it my business. He just dropped these off while I was in the library. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: We just tracked the same thing a few hours ago. Same book, in fact. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Yeah, but the real clue is more where they came from, not what's in them. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Fi, that's just dangerous. What are you doing holding onto this stuff? &gt;&gt; Fiona: If he wanted to hurt me, he would have already. Can't you see that he wants me personally involved? He wants me to find out about him, probably to publicize his story. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Okay, hold on a second. If he wants his story on the front page, he's got a dozen or so working writers here in town. Hell, the Times is less than a hundred miles away. No offense, but why you? &gt;&gt; Fiona: Look, whatever the reason is, he chose me. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: What have you got? &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: These books are from Milburn Juvenile Detention Center. These barcodes here prove that. They're actually codabar, an old system that they used back in the 70s. Milburn closed down more than eight years ago. These books came from there, so he came from there. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Okay, good work. We'll check it out. But for now everybody goes home and gets some sleep. Everybody. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: You look so very at home sitting there. &gt;&gt; Fiona: I am at home, dad, but you know I can't stay here forever. Class isn't a life you know. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Yes, I know. &gt;&gt; Fiona: I made some eggs and bacon for you. Over there on the counter. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Thank you, I saw that. I'm just saying it's nice to see you here, that's all. And I'm sure you feel safer here. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Yes, I feel safe. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: More coffee? &gt;&gt; Fiona: Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Whoa. Check this out. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Well, I would. You'll have to make the screen a little larger. I'm 107. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Lemme zoom in. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Holy shit, Choice Therapy? &gt;&gt; Fiona: Milburn. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Milburn. You just kick the police's ass with your laptop? Is that how it works? &gt;&gt; Fiona: That's where I get it from. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Well everyone knows that. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Come on let's go, gonna be late. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Wait a minute. What? &gt;&gt; Fiona: I emailed Benson, he's digging up an address, he's gonna call us on the cell. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: You said we, there can be no we. &gt;&gt; Fiona: You can leave me here and keep guessing what I'm up to or you can take me with, you know, for yourself? &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Yeah, fine. Go ahead, get in the shower. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Just for now, okay? Stay in the car? Seriously? &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: Hidey-ho. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: Step on out. &gt;&gt; Fiona: You scared me. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: Oh, sorry. &gt;&gt; Fiona: That's okay. &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: Doctor Ronald Pendleton. You already knew that. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Nice to meet you, sir. &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: You too. This way we go. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Just try not to. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Of course, this is in regards to your work at Miburn with Jonah Connection, and hoping that someone might come to mind. Which is why we've come here, hoping you could narrow the field. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: Could be any one of these candidates. &gt;&gt; Fiona: So the rumors, the abuse, was true? &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: The facts say yes, but the state? No, ma'am. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Right, sir, but if you could answer the question? &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: Well, I propose that even if you left here today with a name, you're not better off. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: And I propose you underestimate me. &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: [LAUGH] [APPLAUSE] I'm water, you're the horse. He brought you to me! The books, Milburn. He knows you're here, he wants you to be here. Under his terms, not yours. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: And it's safe to say your choice therapy wasn't exactly a cure-all for one particular boy. &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: Hey, I never said it was therapy, and I never ever said that it was any kind of a cure-all. It was more like a barometer about how the choices that we make define us. What better way to understand how the mind works than by analyzing the most difficult choices we have to make. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: He chose you, that's interesting. So far that I can see you're holding up your part of the bargain. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: That's also interesting, most people would have cut tail and run by now. But not you. And he knows that. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: And I'll tell you something detective, he's gonna catch you. And he's gonna catch you way before you ever catch him. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Do you believe this guy? &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: There you are. All you have to do is very carefully look at the tapes. And you know what, he's gonna jump off that tape and tell you exactly who he is. And there is no way that you will ever stop him. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Thank you, sir. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: You take care, take care of him. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: And you, sir, be warned. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: The choice is now. Snap her neck and leave immediately or stay here for another 10 years. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: What's your answer now? &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Speaker 15: I'd kill you before I kill this dog, you sick old fuck! &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Speaker 15: How about I reach over and break your neck? Do I get the money then? Or just another ten years? &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: That'll be all. &gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Fuck you. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: See, this kid I like. &gt;&gt; Al: That's done, here's the last one. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Young Nathan Jones: Yeah, I like her. &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: Let me ask you a question. If I were to offer you $1,000 to snap her neck, would you? &gt;&gt; Young Nathan Jones: No. &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: Are you sure? &gt;&gt; Young Nathan Jones: I wouldn't hurt Molly, would I girl? Just cuz I'm in here doesn't make me what you think I am. &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: Let's make it 10,000. &gt;&gt; Young Nathan Jones: You're playing a game, I get it. &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: A simple choice, yes or no. &gt;&gt; Young Nathan Jones: No, I wouldn't. &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: What if I informed you that she was scheduled to be put down anyway, later this afternoon at the pound. Nothing you could do to stop it. Then would you take the $10,000? &gt;&gt; Young Nathan Jones: No, I'm not a monster. &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: $100,000? &gt;&gt; Young Nathan Jones: I said no, now leave me alone. &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: Well, that choice is now. Snap her neck and leave immediately. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: Or stay here for another ten years. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: Please, choose. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: God, what have you done? My God, Jesus stop the tape. &gt;&gt; Young Nathan Jones: So I guess I'm free to go. &gt;&gt; Ronald Pendleton: Stop the tape! &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Al: Holy shit, what's that kid's name? &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Yeah, what is that kid's name? &gt;&gt; Fiona: Nathan Jones. &gt;&gt; Al: Nathan Jones? &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Al: All right, adopted when he was two months old. The adoptive parents return the kid to Child Services when he was three years old. Mentally unstable, destructive. &gt;&gt; Fiona: How destructive can you be at three? &gt;&gt; Al: I guess destructive enough for the state to take him back. That's pretty goddamn destructive for that to happen, don't you think, boss? &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Yeah, I never heard of that happening. Does it say anything else about what happens to the kid next? &gt;&gt; Al: Yeah, let me see, after several years in an orphanage, he was finally placed in foster care. And get this, his foster dad was Simon Campbell, the musician. It says here that there were allegations of sexual abuse. That was five months before he was moved out of Campbell's care. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Oh, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Al: And then he was placed in the home of Martin and Melinda Marlowe. He lived with the Marlowes for only two years, before the daughter, Jenna, accused him of rape. Charges were never proven, but Nathan was removed from their home. Shit, then he headed to Milburn, and that's when the real shit started. Hey boss, we got an address. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Let's go, right now. No, no, no, not you. Where are you going? You stay here, you've done good work, so keep following it. Alice can help you. Alice, you'll make sure she stays? For my peace of mind. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Okay. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Just stay. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Speaker 18: Oh, my goodness, what took you so long? It's went out last night. It stinks to high heaven in there. It's actually disgusting, right? &gt;&gt; Speaker 19: We'll check it out, we'll check it out. &gt;&gt; Speaker 18: It's disgusting. Please. &gt;&gt; Speaker 19: We got it. &gt;&gt; Speaker 19: Stay back. &gt;&gt; Speaker 18: Everybody's disgusted with the smell. &gt;&gt; Speaker 19: Stay back. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Okay boys, break it down. Ready? &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Speaker 20: Police! Don't move! &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: All right, uniformers, I want you to follow through. Watch your step. &gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Speaker 20: I can't wait my schedule. &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Al: Fuck me. I don't even wanna know what that shit is. Fuck me. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Speaker 19: Ken, check the back. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Speaker 19: Oh! Christ! Get forensics here right away. Jesus. Find White. Get him down here. He's gotta see this. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] [SOUND] [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Speaker 20: Chief! &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Yeah? &gt;&gt; Speaker 20: You better come take a look at this. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Worse then in here? &gt;&gt; Speaker 20: A little bit. &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Are you all right? &gt;&gt; Speaker 20: No. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] [MUSIC] [SOUND] [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Sandy: ISO 17, I 17. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Speaker 19: This thing cause a fuse to blow the mains on the entire building. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; Speaker 19: Which in turn shut off these air fresheners designed to mask the stench. We found his dog locked up in his bathroom over there. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Dog by the name of Molly? &gt;&gt; Speaker 19: Yeah. I can't even describe that next part. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Jesus, who the fuck is that? &gt;&gt; Speaker 19: That is who we believe is Dr. Ronald Pendleton. We found his ID under the tub. Forensics is running a check on it. I think you're gonna find the next revelation a little more disturbing. &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Yeah, what is that? &gt;&gt; Speaker 19: I'll show you. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Speaker 19: From the looks of it you are next. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Fiona, Dad, listen. I have some news. I need to talk to you. You gotta call me back as soon as you get this. &gt;&gt; [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Bye. Yeah, I still can't reach her. &gt;&gt; Al: So, boss, listen. What if this guy &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: Hey boss. &gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO] [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Hello? &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Anybody here? &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Hello? &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Oh, Jesus. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Open the door. &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: Hello, Fiona. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Let me out of here. &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: Welcome to a special place for bad little children. Don't be overly concerned with. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Open the door. &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: It's a harmless little gas. That will knock you right out. See you when you wake up. &gt;&gt; Fiona: [COUGH] &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: Well who's awake? &gt;&gt; [SOUND] [BLANK_AUDIO] &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: Your father made our mother choose. Your father, our mother, do you get it? &gt;&gt; Fiona: I don't understand. &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: When your father, Tom, was away at the academy, she met my dad. I was conceived right here in this room. Tom said he wouldn't raise another man's child. He made her choose. You weren't even born yet. She chose you over me. She told me it was the hardest choice she ever had to make. But I gave her one that was even harder. She made the ultimate sacrifice, for you Fiona. She chose to die so you could live. &gt;&gt; Fiona: You killed her. You killed her and made it look like a suicide. &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: No, I gave her a choice, she killed herself. &gt;&gt; Fiona: It can't be. &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: You should feel special Fiona, no one ever did that for me. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Why are you doing this to me Nathan? Look, I understand why you're angry, you have every right to be, but why am I here? &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: You think I'm ugly don't you? I'm not as pretty as you. It's no wonder she chose you. Three years ago, after our mother died, I put a gun in my mouth and I pulled the trigger. When I woke up I looked like this. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: Pendleton was right. Our choices define us. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] [SOUND] &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: Did you ever I wonder why he was so quick to put her in the grave and forget the whole thing? &gt;&gt; Fiona: Dad, can you hear me? &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: It must have been pretty painful that this where she had to end her life. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Dad. Dad. &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: I wanted you to know the truth want you to hear it from him. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Dad, can you hear me? &gt;&gt; Nathan Jones: Go ahead and ask him. Ask him, Fiona. Go ahead, ask him. Ask him, ask him what he did. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Is it true? Was there a baby before I was born? &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: You know I love you more than anything. &gt;&gt; Fiona: Nathan, stop! &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Nathan, I'm begging you please. Look at me Nathan. Nathan please. Nathan stop! &gt;&gt; Tom Wagner: Aah! &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: Nathan please! &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: No no please, no. &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: It's okay, breathe. &gt;&gt; [SOUND] [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Fiona: No God, no! No! &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] [SOUND] [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Speaker 21: Hey lady, you okay? You need some help? &gt;&gt; [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Speaker 21: And I forgot to tell you how much you remind me of your mother. &gt;&gt; [SOUND] [BLANK_AUDIO] [MUSIC] [BLANK_AUDIO]
