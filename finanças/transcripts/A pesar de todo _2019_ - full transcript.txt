NETFLIX PRESENTS Yeah. You are absolutely right. I should have told you in person, but you know I don't have time for anything. This is so sad. Right. But in a few days, things will look much better. Leave me the keys, please. Thank you. Bye. CLAUDIA: MOM PASSED AWAY. PLEASE CALL HOME. Come on now. Piss off. Go on! Honey. I wish I could go with you. -I'm going to a funeral, not a party. -I know. But what will your family think if, after a year together, I'm not with you? -My sisters don't know about you. -What? Maricruz, listen. About the situation with my husband. -Yes? -Don't say a word to my sisters. Yes, madam. We'll tell them that... he's on a trip, and that's it. But I thought your husbandwas on a trip. He is on a trip. That's what I said. He's on a trip. Yes, madam. How rude. Look who's here. Who told him? He's family. I mean, he's practically family. It's only natural. Who are all these people? Second uncles of Mom or something. -I don't know. -Or something. -What? -Mom had no second uncles, Claudia. -Or what's up with all those thongs? -What are you talking about? -The collection of thongs your mother had. -Come on. -Come on, Claudia. Please. -But... -Who wears a thong at the age of 70? -Sophia Loren. -And Mom. -Knock it off. Enough. That's what I'm saying, but... Please. Look. I bet you 20 bucks... that blonde is wearing a thong. -No? -I'll be right back. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. My deepest condolences. She was a wonderful woman. Wonderful. Thank you. Thanks for coming. Were you a friend of Mom's? Something like that. Wow... you look familiar. You are... Go away. You can't be here... at my wife's funeral. Be gone. -Be gone. -Dad. Dad. Take care of him. He'll need it. He's the best man your mother could have wished for. I have to go. Thank you. Thank you. -Who was that? -I don't know. You liked her too, right? I don't know any of Mom's friends. -Do you? -No, I don't. Well, you live in Madrid. I don't. Right, I live in Madrid. But I also have a busy social life. -Classes of courses that I'm enrolled in. -Please. I mean... I don't know. Where's your husband? Flying. Flying? You didn't tell him? I didn't want to upset him, you know? What do you mean "upset him", Claudia? Your mother is dead. -When do you expect to upset him exactly? -I'll figure it out. Or have you guys come to Madrid for two hours to arrange my life? You've got a nerve! -Which one is the lesbian? -The "thespian"? -The lesbian. -What? The lesbian! Ana. Hello, how are you? -I can't stand those old gossipers. -Ignore them. Sofía. Sofía! Bastards! -You're all bastards! -Dad! -You're all-- -Please, Dad, stop it! -Let me go! Get out! -Dad, stop! -Careful! Stop it! -Get out of here! My God! Stop! My God, he is completely insane. You all right? Sorry. I'm sorry. -It's OK, Dad. -Dad. -I'm sorry. -You need to rest. Sorry. -Where did he get this saber? -Saber? It's a butcher's knife, Claudia. -Dad is not well. -I think he looks in shape. -I'm going to see him. -Claudia. Sara is with him, it's fine. Oh, so Sara is with him? You're never here, or Sara, or anyone. -So I never know when you girls are here. -Oh, so now it's my fault? I don't want to rest. Just for a little while. Just a nap. -Just a short nap. -No, let's make a pact. Five minutes. Just a short nap. And... we'll continue... Alejandro? Hey! What are you doing? -What about Alejandro, Dad? -His show! It's on TV right now. Put it on for me, please. Because it's not you. I love you. All I know is I want to be with you... -...love you forever. -Too bad... -...that he's marrying Manuelita... -I'll wait for you. -...rather than any other girl. -I love you. I love you more than anyone in this world. I've realized I can't live without you. Hi. Hi. How are you? I'm good. Everything OK? If you need anything... -Long time, no see. You still in New York? -Yeah. Haven't you missed all this? -No. -Come on. What about a nice glass of wine? Or some ham? -What? -Paella at Casa Rita, -or tapas at Los Palomos. -Alejandro, this is full of people. I'm not doing a culinary tour right now. I haven't seen you in five years. Nothing to say? I have nothing to say to you. Sara, it was you who left. Do you really want to talk about what happened right now? What? You left! I waited for you for months. Not a single call. Not a visit. Not an email. Nothing. -Sara... -Just leave, please. -Sara, let me-- -Just go, please. This is so disrespectful. -Shit, here we are! I'm so stressed out. -Well, about time! -What happened? -I got held up. We were getting ready. -You have to wake up earlier. -We're only ten minutes late, OK? -Twelve minutes. -Don't argue. Is there a bigger drama queen out there? Claudia, I'm having a great morning, so don't fuck it up for me. We're going to read our mother's will. Please, for once in your life, can you not argue like some teenage girls? Let's get it over with and go home. Exactly. We read the will and we can all go home. This way. The notary is at number 2C, I think. Let me see. You must know that your mother considered this will at length. We spent so many hours together. So many hours? How many hours? First, you must know your mother wanted half her inheritance to cover the care and meet the needs of your father. Well, I think we are all OK with that. So that's great. So, what about the other half? Well, the other half... I think the best thing to do is to... hear it from her. Excuse me? Are you really going to play a video? I understand all this must be confusing for you. Don't worry. That is why I request your attention for a minute. You'll see that it's a lot easier to understand. Very well. Here? Ready? Yes. My dearest daughters... if you are watching this video, that means I'm no longer by your side. And that is why I want to tell you... you are the best thing that ever happened to me. The best. You have filled me with happiness. You have given me so many memories. You have made me so proud. Maybe I wasn't the best mom in the world. But I feel fulfilled. There is just one thing that... I have always carried with me. That I never dared to confess. But I don't want to take it to my grave. Because it has to do with all of you. I have always kept your real roots hidden from you. Today is the day that I confess to you that Dad... Pedro... is not your biological father. What did she say? But if you follow my instructions, you'll know your true identity soon. This is a joke, right? This is some kind of bad joke, right? It's amazing. What a fucking marvelous woman. Will you please explain to us what she means? Our dad isn't really our dad? What your mother meant is that your father... is not the man who conceived you. Shit, Mom. Unbelievable. Your mother was a special woman. Ravishing. -Right. -What about Dad? Your dad is sterile. -What? -All right. This is some intense joke. -Sit down. -Yes, I'd better sit down. Your parents made an agreement when they found out. It's obvious. Mom would fuck around while Dad stayed home, waiting for her. Would you watch what you say about Mom, since she is right there? -It's-- -What do you want me to say? -Am I being disrespectful to her? -Will you two stop this show? Will you calm down, please? One thing is certain, this fun party is our late mother's doing. -You're right, Sofía. -Yeah. We just said, "One minute. We'll arrange the inheritance and go home." Great. So why didn't they use artificial insemination? It was a different time. It wasn't as common back then as it is today. They tried twice, but it didn't work. So who is our father? Our biological father, I mean. That's the thing. So... you may not share the same biological father. Hold on, if you are trying to tell us that our mother was somewhat of a loose woman, I think we really got the message, right? I mean, I know this is not easy. Your mother wanted each one of you to find out who you father is yourselves. OK, all right. The whole paternity issue is super fun. But what about the inheritance? What did she say? I will only be able to tell you what share you are each entitled to when you solve the paternity conundrum. Like a contest, or something like that. This is fucking great. Pulling the strings even after death. -Fucking great. -Let me just make sure I got this. We need to do a scavenger hunt in order to meet our father. -Right? -Exactly right. I understand you. But what your mother wanted was to make sure that, despite being apart for so long, you would finally spend some time together. Fucking awesome. Great. -Fabulous. -Sounds like a plan. Don't touch me, please. Could you tell us where to start? It says here that we have to start with a guy named Pablo. Pablo. Who knows who that Pablo is? I'm not doing this shit. -Mom made it clear-- -Mom never cared about me. She wouldn't even care if I went with you or not. The thing is, if you don't go, none of us will get the inheritance, Lucía. Money can move mountains, huh? What about Dad? What do we tell Dad? About this scavenger hunt thing? No, we won't say a thing to Dad. He is pretty upset as it is. Hi, girls! Have you seen your mom? Dad. It's just I can't find my Prince of Wales pants, and I need them. I hope they're being ironed, otherwise... -We'll find them and bring them to you. -Yeah? -Yeah. -Now I'll ask you a favor. Please. Alejandro's show is starting today. And I would like to look elegant, majestic. -We'll get them right away. OK, Dad? -Yeah? OK, but I feel terrible. To me, that's our dad. As much as we want to find some new sperm now. Obviously. But that new sperm may help us understand why we are all so different. I don't know. I wish I could understand why I didn't belong in this fucking house. So what do we do? Do we search or not? Let's see. -Here? -Yeah. Number three, right? -Shall we go in? -Let's go. An artist. Anyway... Hello? Fuck! Is anyone here? Hello? Yes! I'm coming! Wait a minute, please. -I would fuck him. -Please, Lucía. That could be your father. -Who cares? -That could be Mom's son. Was he at the funeral? Excuse me, I was distracted. When inspiration strikes... I was painting my own body. What's better than your own body to explore? Painting is all about that. Hello, hello there. Wow. I'm Pablo. -Hi. -Sofía. Lucía. -Pablo. -Sara. -You'll get stained. -OK, then. -Pablo. -Clau... Claudia. Nice to meet you. Well, first, I want to apologize to you for failing to introduce myself at the funeral. It's just death and I don't get along. -I go blank. -Do you know who we are? Of course. Four beauties like yourselves? You could only be Carmen's daughters. And I am very happy, really, so happy that you decided to come here. Very happy. Because your mother always refused to let me meet you. Your father's will had to be respected. Not anymore? Can I have a glass of wine, if you have some? Wine! Of course! Wine is life. Follow me. He speaks French. Really? -I mean... -Wow, right? Have you seen that? It's a vagina. It's kind of big, right? It's a pussy, girls. A pussy. I know, but it kind of looks big. Blue vaginas, right? I see. I love this chaos. Wow. Here is the wine. Thank you. So you won't... I'll drink from the bottle. -Cheers. -Cheers. All right, about your mother. Yeah, I met her in a museum. I was an art student and I was fascinated by her. I followed her around, asking her to let me draw a portrait of her. Sorry, a portrait as in the kind of portraits you usually do, right? -Yeah, of course. -Yeah, I thought so. Oh, Carmen... Carmen, my darling... Your mother was a being of light. A pure soul. I still can see us both right there. Naked. Talking about good and evil and art for hours. It's true that I was a lot younger, but I always thought that love in the arms of a mature woman is part of the training of an artist. So the nude at home is Mom painted by you. That's right. -You have a great eye. -I've always liked it. Women. Naked women. Well, my sister also likes them dressed. I mean, she is a... -What's that got to do with anything? -Nothing. Well, only truly interesting people are capable of seeing beyond those trifles. They know love is more important than sex. Men, women, who cares? What matters is the skin. Connecting with the skin, right? With no sense of sin. Virgins, like we came into this world. My sister thinks we were made out of clay. God, no! That would be the void. I, for instance, investigate the cosmos through the human form. Especially through the female body, its most perfect work. I find balance in the curves of a lady. -I also find it, but in a man's body. -OK. Sorry to interrupt, this is very interesting. Art, the universe... Yeah. We're trying to find our father. -One of them. -Yeah. With everything that's happened with Mom, the clues she left for us, we think you might be one of our fathers. Maybe you procreated with our mother. Having sex. -I mean, we all procreate having sex. -Right. Well, I don't believe in science. I believe in the self. And I know I am in this world to share my art, myself. I have so much... just so much to give. -Fabulous. -That's deep. -Do you also paint? -No, not me. She does. I do. I'm an artist, too. All right, then you know exactly what I'm talking about. Knowing that you have a daughter, didn't you ever think... about taking care of her? Knowing... Not at all, I never saw myself raising kids. Maybe you could just tell us who you fathered out of the four of us. -Don't you know that? -No. What? -Actually, that's why we are here. -Oh, Carmen. Delicious. -She makes me laugh from the afterlife. -Right, this shit is not funny for us. Right, of course. I understand. If we tell you our birth dates and do the math, maybe we'll be able to know... No, it's not that simple. I was with your mom for many years. You all were born in that period. That means... I could be the father of all of you... or no one. -Then a DNA test is in order, right? -Right, given the situation... No, I told you I don't believe in science. End of story. Let's see. I'm not reducing myself, my individuality, to a laboratory sample. My body is a work of art, a temple. I'm not losing my mojo, my lifeblood. Can you tell us how we can work this out, then? -Yeah. -Let's go. -No, that's it. If you insist. -He's a temple. There's nothing we can do. -I can't believe this guy. -OK. -Let me take a look at you. -What? -Look at us how? -Well, I'm a painter. Let me look at you. I can see things that other people can't. -Come on... -Let me do a... -No. -No? Bye. -You. -This is not a beauty contest. Stay still. You have the same light as your mother. It comes from within you, like a beacon. Really? Really. Through this, I can see more of you than any damn DNA test. Look, you could have fooled any other girl but me. -Come on. Let's go. -Wait! Paint your damn father! -Let me paint you! -No. -Fuck you, asshole! -We're not fighting. Let's go. Wait! Please, what an idiot. I'm offering you immortality! -How long have you been drinking? -What? You're always holding a new glass of wine. Well, I mean... Seeing the state of things, it's not that strange. And what about your husband? What? Does Raúl know about Mom? Did you tell him? Obviously. I've told him, of course. And? Go figure. He is... in shock because... I mean, he loved Mom so much. -He's upset. Devastated. -Right. Girls, I've been thinking. I couldn't care less about Mom's sex life. -That's that. -But you heard Mr. Luis. -Mom wants us to find-- -Look... Excuse me, but I don't care what Mom wanted. We can't go begging around for our paternity like we were... I don't know. Then we'll call him and tell him we give up our inheritance. -And that's it. -No. I didn't say that, did I? OK. You know very well that, with no father, there is no inheritance. Call the notary and tell him we give up. Great, then do it. Call him. What do I care? -I won't stop you. -Well, maybe I will. -You will? -You've changed your mind? First it was stupid and now you want to go on? I do think it's stupid. I think Mom's laughing at us, even though she's dead. But I want to know who my father is. And we'll get this over with soon. All right. Let's vote on this. That's only fair. -OK. -Great. Who wants to continue? There you go. It's a tie. I agree with you, OK? But I think we should do what Mom asked us to do. -There you go. Three. That's a majority. -Is that it? That's a majority. Great. Let's see which father we're going to meet tomorrow then. RAÚL HUSBAND -Someone's at the door. -Yeah. I was going to get it and... Hey, Don Juan! -Come in. -OK. -Hi. -I'm going out. I've got plans. See you tomorrow. Alejandro, I... I don't know if this is right. No, these are for your father. So is this. All right. You need to put those in water. OK. Let's... try the flan. Very well. -Sarita... -No. How often do you come here? Well, exactly... Anytime he wants. This is his home. Now that we're here, maybe there's no need for him to come. What do you mean there's no need? This is the nicest flan I've ever had. Yeah, but we can ask him where he buys it. Actually, my mother makes it. Hey, your mother has to come here one afternoon and set up a tasting session of her authentic flan. Sara, what do you think? Dad... Alejandro and I are no longer together. You must know. Maybe we could ask his mother for the recipe. -Right? -Sure. Sara, I know you left your beloved to move to USA. You also abandoned your family. In addition, you moved to a place where there is nothing but hamburgers and lifeguards in hideous red bathing suits. I didn't abandon anyone, Dad. I went to USA chasing a dream, that's all. A dream? What can you do with dreams... when you are alone? Ask your mother. Mom never left you. Your mother left me... She left me a long time ago. She left me stranded. Like some old shoe. That makes two of us. I'll give you some advice, Sarita. Learn from her, from your mother's mistakes. Don't lose... the people who love you. And now it is time for an authentic flan. The real flan. How is it? FLORIST'S & TEA SHOP Hello! Hello. You're the youngest of Carmen's daughters, right? -Yeah. -Lucía. -You were at the funeral, right? -Yes. I'm Inés. -Nice to meet you. -Not so formal. Your mother and I were really good friends. -Really? -Yeah. Since she moved to this neighborhood. -Damn, that was over 30 years ago. -That's right. Thirty years. OK. What can I get you? I'll have two lattes and two espressos to go. Coming right up. -It's funny that we haven't met before. -You were too young. By the way, I'm sorry about my dad the other day. It's just... He's losing his mind. He's not well. Don't worry. I know your father. I know he is an amazing person. It can't have been easy for him... to know he shared your mother with so many people. What do you know about that? Well, I... You won't tell me? I prefer to respect your mother's will. She wanted her daughters to discover their identities themselves. -Right. -That's fine. It's on me. No, really. Please. This way, you'll come back, pay, and we'll see each other again. Would you like a cookie? -No. -And a brownie? No. -It's so nice to meet you. I mean it. -OK. Thank you, then. Goodbye, Lucía. Oh, Carmen. Do you think Mom travelled this far just to get laid? Hey, could we stop talking about Mom like she was a floozy? -She was a floozy, Claudia. -Please. -Claudia, what's your problem with sex? -Me? I have no problem at all. Really? When was the last time you got laid? Come on. What do you care if I sleep with my husband or not? No, I don't care. But you know what? You're always criticizing my relationships and Lucía's, so I just wanted to know. I mean, you can understand that finding out Mom was an erotic star -is shocking. -An erotic star? An erotic star? Mom was a perfectly ordinary person. Free with her body. Right, she was free. But ordinary... When was the last time you fucked Raúl? -I mean... Do I have to answer that? -Yeah! It's not a humiliating question. Raúl is your husband. Having sex is natural. Of course it's natural, well... -It's been days. -How many days? I mean... A couple of weeks. -Or two months, maybe. -Oh, yeah. That sounds about right. -Five months. -Five months! -What? -Nothing. It was obvious. -What's obvious? -Raúl and you are having problems. It's obvious you two are struggling. But don't worry, none of us will ask you -when you had sex before that time. -No. -All that Instagram couldn't be good. -Is this why you wanted to go in one car? So you could attack me while I'm trapped? -To rub in my face how much my life sucks. -What? No. -No. Hey! -No. Excuse me. That's right, my life sucks. But hear me out. At least I... I don't need to have sex with the first dude I see on the street because I need a self-esteem boost. Nor do I need to be with a different girl each night due to my commitment issues. Nor do I need to focus on work obsessively because I can't admit I'm still in love with my ex, and my self-pride won't let me forgive him. So, yes, my life sucks. But not more than yours, yours, or yours. I really want to hit you right now. I've never heard you talk like that. I love it! -I'm not in love with Alejandro. -Yeah, right. -I don't have any commitment issues. -Whatever. Well, I've never met a girlfriend of yours. It's all right, honey. All of us here have some amount of shit. It's OK, it's all right. All right, I have a proposal for you. Let's smoke the peace pipe. What peace pipe? -I don't smoke. -It's what Mom wanted, right? Come on. -I'll put some music on. -What is that? -It's a rocket, dummy. -I'm serious. What is that? -It's marihuana. -It's marihuana. I mean... -Come on! -Go on! Go on! Do you want me to choke? It's been ages since I last smoked. If I'm different from them I'm not anybody's I belong to no one Who cares what I do? Who cares what I say? I am this way I will remain this way I will never change Look, she loves it! -What? -Who cares what I do? Who cares what I say? I am this way I will remain this way I will never change Maybe it is my fault For not following the norm It is too late for me to change now I will stand by my beliefs I will hold my ground What's this guy's name again? I am Father Díaz. I appreciate you coming here to pay me a visit. I guess you know your mom refused to let me see any of you. Yeah, we are aware of that. Meeting you at last is a blessing for me. I've prayed to God for this day. I also asked God to look out for you. Father, I thought you guys couldn't... -No, she means... -...do it. We just didn't expect you to be... -A monk, right? -Exactly. -This way. -And blind. A blind monk. Blind people do it too, you know? He can still hear you! I still remember her. Those curves... That smile... The beautiful way she moved. -Father, you're getting off the point. -Yeah. -We're trying to find our dad, remember? -One of them. -Yeah. -Oh, right. Forgive me. The thing is... when I confessed my feelings to her, rather than slap me, Carmen offered to sleep with me. All this is so shocking. -And I'm supposed to be the loose one. -Shit, me too. It happened only once, but... it was enough to meet her needs. Months later, she wrote me a letter, thanking me for my collaboration. But I had already given myself to the Lord and I couldn't pull out of it. Sure, pull out, right? We know that moment meant a lot to you. -So you probably remember the date, right? -Sure, how could I forget? It was April 2, 1985. We made love from 6:55 to 6:60 a.m. -I mean, 7:00. -Don't count, it's Sofía. -Father... -My girl! -No... -My girl. -No, she is your daughter. Sorry. -Oh, my daughter! -It's not me. It's her. -Not her, either. My daughter. Let me... I always imagined that you'd be this beautiful. Let me give you a hug. My girl. -My girl! -It's the marijuana. -I don't know if it's a good idea. -What? Come on, it would be appropriate. -She knows who her father is. We don't. -I know. Sara, that guy is creepy. But she just has to go and do it. It's OK. You tell her, then. Me? -Hello. -Hey! Finally. I thought you didn't want to talk to me anymore. Marta... Listen... I know you are... expecting something from me that I may not... No, it's my fault. Why do you say that? Because I got my hopes up, Sofía. I think we might get engaged at any moment and... And then you disappear. And I don't hear from you again. Marta... You have no idea how hard this has been. I won't be here forever, Sofía. I know. We'll talk tomorrow. Till tomorrow. Hi. Hey. How are you? I'm not sure. -I thought things would go differently. -Right. I am a lesbian. An atheist. With a priest for a father. -It seems like a joke. -It kind of does. But, at least you know now who your father is. Right? Tell her now. -What's going on? -We need you, that's all. We need your help. Pablo isn't your dad, so only you can do something for us. Go to his studio and get a sample of his DNA. You heard him. He doesn't care for tests. Right. But while we were there, we also saw that... -Yes. -...he kind of liked you. -Exactly. -We thought you could go and talk to him. Yes, and then you could get a nail from him. Or a tiny hair. -Of course, or a hair. -It could be... A gum chewed by him would work too. -A small thing. -It would work genetically speaking. -You're kidding. -We're not. It would be easier for you to pose for him and get a hair from him. That's all. And we'll go on with the rest. Also, you can get a painting for free. Think about that. I have my own paintings. Did you see what that guy draws? Nudes. Right, but you're so open-minded. You are OK with that. Yeah, I'm open-minded. But you want me to get naked in front of one of your dads? -I don't mind if he sees you naked. -Me neither. -I also don't. -Not at all. You getting naked in front of a possible dad of mine wouldn't bother me at all. You know what? That's not the issue. The issue is none of this makes any sense. And you're all crazy. Come on, Sofía. The answer is in his DNA. Also, think about getting this all over with. I don't know. Please. Do it for us. Come on. See? Not everything had to be thrown away. What do you mean, Claudia? Mom didn't only sleep with hippies and priests. I hope so. This guy is elegant, I'm telling you. -We can't know that. We don't know him. -You can smell that sort of thing. -Hello. -Good afternoon. We have an appointment with Mr. Víctor... -Nozal. -Víctor Nozal. -I'll let him know. -OK. -Go to the seventh floor. -Thank you. Carrara marble. Impressive. Hello. Are you Víctor? -That's right. -Hello. -My pleasure. -Mine too. -Hello. -Please. -Please. -Let's go to my office. By the way, this building is stunning. Yeah, it was one of my first projects as an architect. I wanted to showcase the architectural waves that stuck with me as a student. Fabulous. Please, have a seat. Would you like a drink? -No. -Yes. That Cabernet Sauvignon is my favorite. Very well. Your mother... She was from another world. I asked her to marry me many times but... But she told me she'd never leave Pedro. I never understood how she could be so passionate in bed with me... then go back to another man. You can spare us the details, really. Thanks. Well, marriage is overrated and there are less and less honest people in the world. Víctor, are you all right? You came for the truth... and here I am, lying to you. Shit, come on. This office. This suit. None of it is mine. Not even the shoes I'm wearing. But you are Víctor? You were our mother's lover. Yes, but I'm not the architect of this building. I'm just... ...the janitor. And I clean the offices on weekends. Do you think we're in the mood for this? I didn't want my daughter... to know that I'm a failure. A man who lost everything to gambling and drink. Do you mean you are a homeless man? Can you remember the dates when you had relations with our mother? Well, our relationship lasted for years, but not continually. OK, so anyone of us could be your daughter, right? No, not just anyone. Only she... who bears my mother's name. What is your mother's name? Claudia. It's me. I'm Claudia. My girl. I love the studio. It's wonderful. Yeah. And I love the fact that I'm not your father. Why don't you lie down? Stretched out. It's more elegant. Of course. I'm not used to being on this side. -I'm always doing the painting. -Of course. And posing is difficult. -Would you take off your hat? -Oh, right. Oh, sorry. Sorry... Look. Wow. You know? I'm not sure how to do this. Could you help me? Yeah, sure. This usually works, although it's a bit uncomfortable. Move your hip forward. -OK. -And stretch your leg out further. I don't know if this helps. -These pillows might not be very helpful. -Right. Your feet. -Maybe... -There. Let's leave them like this. Better? Oh, I'm sorry. It's just being here... I'm having some kind of connection with my mother. A memory of her... Forgive me. I'm such a fool. Would you mind giving me a hug? If that's OK. You want a hug? No, it's fine. It doesn't matter. Forgive me. I will, of course. All I want is for you to be comfortable. All right. Sorry. OK. Yeah. I'm sorry! What happened? -I don't know... -Oh, my ring! -I'm so sorry. -No, it's all right. I feel so much better. I'm more relaxed. Thank you. I understand you. I'm also moved. Having painted your mother moves me. So does painting you now. Claudia. Hey. -Are you staying over? -I think so. You have nothing to be ashamed of. Well. A lot is happening in a very short time. -I lied to my father. -Technically, I did, not you. Right, but I couldn't bring myself to... I don't know. You'll be ready eventually. Right? -Get some rest. -Thank you. -Good night. -Good night. And good luck tomorrow. Will you calm down? I really don't get how you can be so calm. I mean it. -He is either your father or mine. -Well, the test will let us know. TENDHALS CLINIC CLINICAL TESTS -Hello. -Hello. We're here to pick up these results. Thank you. Hello? Hello? This is fun. -You're crazy. -No. -Excuse me. -I want to paint you again. Sofía? Sara! -What are you doing here? -Did you just have sex with my father? My daughter! Sara, I... Sara, hey! -Leave me alone. -Listen, it's OK. It's all right. That didn't mean anything. I don't care who you sleep with, Sofía. I don't care how open-minded you are. I couldn't care less. Sara. Listen to me. That was just an experience. I hope you enjoyed this experience... because this really means something to me. Come on, Sara. Don't be mad. You knew very well that he was the father of one of us. But you didn't care. You can't always do what you want. MY LIFE WITHOUT HER PETITION FOR DIVORCE Can I sit down? What are you doing here, Alejandro? Well, I could lie and say that this is where I walk the dog. Or that I always buy the newspaper in that kiosk. I come because this place reminds me of you. Sara, I know what you're going through. No, you don't know. You have no idea. You don't know. I want to say something to you. I'm leaving tomorrow. I have to go far away, start something new. Otherwise, I won't get over you. I made a mistake. I should have been on that plane with you, but I wasn't. There is no going back now. Sara... Sara, you'll always be the love of my life. I'm sorry I failed you. Hi. Hello. I came to see Víctor. The janitor? -The janitor, yes. -Seventh floor. Víctor. Víctor. Hello. This is a surprise. What brings you here? Where are your sisters? No, it's just me. Are you OK? Can I do anything for you? Well... -Yesterday... -Yesterday was a memorable day. A dream of mine came true. I got to meet my daughter, Claudia. Oh, sorry. Forgive me. Actually, I wanted to talk about that. The Claudia you met yesterday... isn't Claudia. That was Sara, my sister. I'm Claudia. What? I don't understand. What? It's just... We came to this wonderful building with the fancy office... and then you broke down. And I can be so stupid sometimes. And I was shocked. I wanted to apologize to you. Then it's you? Claudia? My daughter? There's nothing to forgive. I totally understand. I'm not the father you were hoping for. No. Maybe... I was expecting to find another kind of man, but, I'm telling you, you are the father I need right now. My girl. Give me a hug. Lucía. Are you all right? -Yeah. -You're freezing. Get inside, I'll make you a coffee. What are you doing here so early? -Of course she loved you, Lucía. -She didn't love me. She never loved me. She never cared for me. Not even when she said goodbye. Never. -Don't talk like that. -That's the truth. Didn't you notice? All my sisters know who their biological father is. What about me? I don't understand. What is it? I don't know... Don't I have a father? Am I adopted? I don't know. What is it? Don't despair, you are so close. Life can be so hard sometimes. Look at me. I haven't had it easy. I've cried so much. So much. Seas of tears. But I have fought for my happiness. It's important you go back to the notary. What? Call your sisters. Because there's one thing your mom hasn't told you. The most important thing for you. What do you mean? Let me go with you. Lucía... You will see. Trust me. -Good morning. -Great. Good morning. Sit down, please. Right, we'd better sit down. We never know what to expect from Mom. I'm happy that you found everything you were looking for. -If you could get to the point, please. -I see that not everything happened-- -Will you play the fucking video? -Yes. -One second. Don't worry. -Thanks. I'm so happy you're all watching this video. That means you have already found out who your biological fathers are. At least, three of them. Sara, my dear daughter... You are strong and independent. The one who is most like me. I hope this journey has brought you and your sisters together like never before. And I hope you have realized that what matters most in life isn't being number one... but being surrounded by all those people who need you and love you. My beautiful Claudia... I know you have a real heart of gold. You already had it as a young girl. I'm sure that, after all that's happened, you will be able to get back that tender heart... and you will also accept each of your sisters just the way they are. You will even accept yourself, without the need to care about what others think... or be waiting for the husband... who does not deserve you. My Sofía... You were always such a rebel, so brave, so free. Although you probably know you don't live in a world that understands freedom the way you do. The time has come for you to be honest with yourself. And if you really care about someone... go for it. Being brave isn't just about being by yourself... it's also knowing how to commit to someone. Finally... my sweet Lucía. My sweet baby girl. You don't know how special, how unique you are to me. You were never afraid to be yourself... even knowing that I was distant. I know it hurt you, and I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Forgive me. You are the daughter of my great love. My true love. I love all four of you so much. I hope you are as happy as I was. Goodbye, my darlings. I will always be in your hearts. Are you kidding me? How can it end like that? And my father? Who the fuck is my father? -Is it you? -Me? No. It's me. What? I'm your father. Your mother and I met 25 years ago. We fell madly in love. We really loved each other. So much so that we stayed together... even after my surgery. Surgery? She did it out of love. But man or woman... I'm here for you, my girl. Dad. Mom. Hello? Alejandro came to say goodbye. -If you don't go now to his mother's... -But... ...you will lose him forever. Go get him back. He really loves you, you fool. What's wrong? Sara. -Sara. -It's OK. Sara! Look, the car is here. -Don't forget to call me when you land. -OK, Mom. Come here, give me a hug. -Bye, Mom. I'll call you from the airport. -All right. Alejandro! Wait! Don't go. Wait! You can't go. You can't leave. I just wanted you to come after me and do what they do in love movies. Giving up everything for love, but... I've realized life is not like that, life is different. Forgive me. What? I'm in love with you. I want to give it another chance. Don't go. I love you so much. I love you! Hey, Angelita. I'm so glad to see you here. You have sweetened my life for so many years with your flan. -You couldn't imagine. -Well, making flan... is not what I'm best at. Good heavens. Hey, Don Juan! Careful with those wandering hands! You look so beautiful. I think I owe you an apology. Thanks for coming to my wedding. I couldn't not be your bridesmaid. Look how great I look in this suit. So you came because of that? Sorry. I don't know why I didn't go back to being single earlier. I mean, there are two guys... Did it have to be now, when I've jumped off the cliff? -What? -That's some rock! Wow! -I can't believe it. -Shit! I've got something for you. -The love rocket. -Again? -Hey, it's to make you happy. -Light it. -Come on. -Don't be too obvious. Subtitle translation by Olga Hernández
