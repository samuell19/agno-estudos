- It's quiet out here at night. Kind of lonely, like everything's all empty. But it's hiding stuff too. It is, you know, hiding stuff. I'm gonna tell you a story about some things that hide out here in the desert. Nobody knows what they're called. I don't even think they have names like we do, but I do know they were around long before us. Maybe even before the dinosaurs. If you've never heard of them, it's because most people that run into them never live to talk about it. No joke. They live places people usually don't go. And lucky for us, mostly they sleep. But sometimes they wake up, and that's not so lucky. Anyways, stories don't all start where they end up. This one started a long way from here.

(phone ringing) ♪ I wanna be you ♪ ♪ I wanna see you ♪ - Hello? - [Mom] Hey, Cindy, this is Mom. - Who? - Mom, the one who pays your allowance. - Oh, Mom. Hi, Mom. - Cindy, what are you doing up so late? - I couldn't sleep. - What's all that noise? - What? I can't hear you. - I said what's the noise? - Oh, um, Mike's just got MTV on. - Well, no wonder you couldn't sleep. - Hold on, I'll get Mike. Mike, Mike! Mike! - Huh? - Mom, it's Mom! - What? - Mom! It's Mom! - That's a wrap. - Let's go, amscray. Hi, Mom, how was the convention? - Not as much fun as it sounds like you're having. You're not having a party, are you? - No. (cheering) (fireworks booming) No party. Just a few people come over for a study session. (fireworks booming) - They're having another party. Talk to him. - This is your father speaking. How many times have I told you no parties when we're not there? - Ask them if they're making a mess. - Are you make? I'm not asking him that. That's not a father question. You ask them. - Are you making a mess? - Uh, no, no. Relax, everything's fine. I've got everything under control. - Put it on the speaker phone. - What'd you say, Mom? Hey! - Speaker phone. - Thanks a lot, Einstein. So what time are you guys getting home? - Well, we're not really sure. Dad just fell asleep at the wheel a minute ago. - I didn't fall asleep. I just closed my eyes for a couple of seconds. - At 60 miles an hour. We almost ran off the road. And now I think we're lost. - [Dad] We are not lost. I know exactly where we are. I just don't know where we're going. - Well, where are you now? - Well, we turned off exit 23 around 10 minutes ago, and that means we should reach junction 18 by now. But we're just out in the middle of the desert somewhere. - I've got my bearings. We should be home around midnight. We're just gonna be a couple of minutes late. - Marty, look, there's a town. Turn right here. Now, that's odd. - What do you see? Will somebody please tell me what's going on here? - I don't know. We just passed a sign for a town called Long Hand, and the road's dark. We can't see anything. - Mom, just tell Dad to pull over and call the automobile club. - What's that? - What? - Right there. - Mom? You there, Mom? - [Dad] Oh my God. - It's dead. - [Operator] We're sorry, but the number you have called is temporarily out of service. Please check your-- - Phone must be screwed up. - Didn't Mom and Dad sound strange? - They always sound strange, they're our parents. - Hey, guys, you got any more cheese puffs? - Kitchen's closed. - Sorry, kid. Party's over, folks. Where's the love? Come on, come on. Adios, andale, arrivederci, let's go. I know, I know, I'm the party pooper. Drive safe, or ride your bike safe, or whatever you do. If your parents ask, never here. - [Officer] We're very busy now, sir. - I realize that you're busy. No, you may not put me on hold. Don't put me on hold. Don't put... They put me on hold. - What a night. What a party. - What a mess. - [Arnie] Who are you talking to? - I'm not, I'm on hold for the millionth time. - With who? - Highway Patrol. Mom and Dad din't come home last night. - Are you sure? - Well, I didn't hear 'em come in. And I checked their room, and it hasn't been slept in. - Maybe they hit a motel. - Maybe they hit something else. - [Officer] Missing persons. - Yes, hello. Finally. Maybe you can help me. I think my parents are missing. - Hey, guys. - [Officer] Sir, they have to be missing for 48 hours before we can officially file a report. - Where's Mom and Dad? - That's what we're all wondering. - [Officer] And if you do decide to fill out a report, you'll have to come down to the station. - I don't want any excuses. I just want to find my brother! - [Officer] We're doing out best, sir. - [Jack] Well, you're the Sheriff's Department, aren't you? - And who are you? - Me? I'm Jack Reeves, the guy who pays your salary! - [Officer] Calm down, sir. - [Jack] Listen, what is your name? - [Officer] I'm sorry? - [Jack] I'm taking names. - Calm down, Uncle Jack. - Put your supervisor on. I demand action! - You'll get some action when they come and arrest you. - Yeah, well thanks for nothing! Idiots. - I told you not to lose your temper. - Honey, I didn't lose my temper. If I lost my temper, I would've called him a-- - What did they say? - Apparently, they've searched the whole highway. No sign of a crash and no one matching their description in any local hospital. - Well, people don't just fall off the face of the Earth. - Yeah, but they did. - No, they didn't. Your mommy and daddy are going to be home real soon. You'll see. I'm very optimistic. - And in the meantime, your aunt and I will stay in the spare room. So you kids just stay put. - Doesn't sound too optimistic to me. - Think our family tree needs a little pruning. (hard rock music) Hey, Einstein, what are you still doing up? - Searching the road maps on the Net. You know there's no town named Long Hand anywhere on route 18 or 23? There's not even a Long Hand in the state. - [Cindy] But that's the town they said they were in. - Cindy, it's late. Why aren't you asleep? - I can't. I'm too worried about Mommy and Daddy to sleep. - I know, we're all worried, but there's nothing more we can do tonight. - We have to do something tonight. The cops aren't gonna find 'em. - Well, what do you suggest? We put their picture on milk cartons? - I say we go out and look for 'em ourselves. - Yeah, and I'm going with you. - Wait a minute, time out. Who says we're going anywhere? - You're our big brother. I thought you always had everything under control. - I do have everything under control. When I hear a dumb idea-- - So it's a dumb idea to find Mom and Dad? - If we get busted-- - We won't. - Okay, let's get some food and water. And keep it down, you guys. We don't want to wake up Uncle Jack and Aunt Silvia. Let's go. (yawning) I don't know what the heck we're doin'. We've been driving back and forth all night. I don't know how much longer I can do this. - All right, let's try this again. Take exit 23. Take one more pass on the way home. - I got a better idea. How 'bout I pull over and let you drive? - No license. - Ah, good point. I don't get it. There's no turn offs. There's not even a hole in the guardrail, nothin'. There's just no place they could've gone. - Where are we? - We're going home. - What? - You didn't find them? - No. - Then why are we going home? - Because we already looked everywhere we can think of. - We gotta check back with the police. - Look, if they heard anything, they would've called us at home. Does that look like a gas station? - I guess you could call it that. - All right, guys, we're stopping. Last thing we need is to get stuck out in the desert with no gas. (horn honking) Yo, anybody in there? Last Chance Trading Post. Well, that's reassuring. - Expecting a 7-Eleven? Hello? - Yo, anybody here? - Hey, Mike, look at this. Is he dead? - Well, either that or he's really tired. Hey, can I get some gas? - Go ahead, it's self service. - Thanks. - Hey, you got any soda? - There's some over there in the freezer. - [Cindy] Thanks. - Hey, Mister, we're trying to look for our parents. We think they might've gotten lost somewhere along here last night. - Not many places to get lost on this highway. Just one straight road. - Yeah, the thing is we were talking to them on their portable phone, and they said they were going into some town called Long Hand. You ever heard of it? - Long Hand? Never heard of it. - Oh, come on, Mister. If you know anything at all, you've gotta tell us. - Dangerous place for young people to wander around. In the old days, a boy who wanted to be a brave, a warrior, he had to go out into a place of death. He had to face death. The child faces death and he dies, and he's reborn as a brave, as a man. Thing is not everybody gets to be reborn. Sometimes you face death, and you just die. Maybe it'd be better if you all just went home. - Hey, I've got everything under control with the car. - This guy knows about Long Hand. - Yeah? - I never said that. - [Mike] Well, whatever. Look, you know, if you know something, please. - Maybe I can tell you a story I know. - We really don't have time for stories. - You better listen to this story. It's about Long Hand. 120 years ago, some white men built a town. They built it on top of some old ruins. - Don't tell me, an Indian burial ground. - This place was a sacred place to all things that lived before mankind. Things that never really live. Things that sleep. Sometimes they wake up. Then one night, something must've woken 'em up because Long Hand disappeared off the face of the Earth. Gone, no trace. - Disappeared? - That's the truth. Sometimes it reappears. Sometimes people find their way in by accident, and they never come back. - So what are you saying, that our parents were swallowed up by a ghost town? - Maybe. - Here's for the gas and the soda. Come on you guys, let's go. There's just one thing I don't understand. If no one ever comes back, then how do you know so much about it? - Yeah, do you know how to get there? - The only way to get to Long Hand is to dream your way there. - Okay, I've heard enough. Come on, guys. - Hey, kid, did you know that if rattlesnake bites himself, it'll die from his own poison? They're not immune to their own poison. - Really? - You know what that is? According to some people, it's the tooth of a giant rattler that used to live in these parts. Here, that's for you. Careful you don't stick yourself with the tooth. There's still plenty of poison left in it. - Cool, thanks. - Cindy, come on. - [Attendant] Hey, kid. - What? - You forgot your receipt. Just remember, if you do dream your way into Long Hand, Long Hand doesn't need your permission to kill you. It's your soul it really wants, understand? It can't take your soul unless you promise it over. Don't make no promises in Long Hand. Not any way. Not to anybody. - Thanks a lot, that's great advice. See you around. - Yeah, see you around. - That's just what we needed, some crazy old guy. - Yeah, crazy. (ominous droning music) Mike! (tires screeching) Mike! You fell asleep, man. - Geez, I'm sorry. Everybody okay? - I don't know. Something weird was going on out the window. Maybe I was asleep too. - Where are we anyway? - There's a sign. Long Hand. - We found it, cool. - Dreaming. - What? - It's the exact same point where Mom said Dad fell asleep, and then they were lost. And you just fell asleep. - What are you talkin' about? - The Indian, he was right. - You know, for a pretty smart kid, Arnie, you can be pretty stupid sometimes. (shouting) (tires screeching) (horse whinnying) I don't think we're in Kansas anymore. - Arnie, who's that? - Well, it's sure not the Lone Ranger. - [Mike] You've got to be kidding me. - Arnie, where are we, Disneyland? - It's Long Hand. - This whole thing is nuts. - Hey, hey, Mister, can I ask you a question? What's goin' on here? - Yeah, what's with all the cowboy stuff? - Don't quite get your meanin', son. - Well, this is like the 1800s. - It is, 1882 to be exact. - Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me, ladies. Hi, we're just trying to figure out what's going on here. What's the story with all the horses and the Wild West get-ups? And don't tell me it's 1882, because that's a Chevy Impala, 1967. - Funny lookin' contraption. What does it do? - What do you mean what does it do? It's a car. - Kinda far from the railroad tracks, ain't it? (laughing) - Right. There's a hotel, maybe they can help us out. Come on. Well, it's not exactly the Hilton. - Who's James Garfield? - I'm not sure, but we play his high school in football. - Are you sure we're related? - Yeah, unfortunately. (bell ringing) - A room for the night, little ones? - We're looking for our parents actually. Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, did they check in? - Yeah, a couple of people about, I don't know, parent-aged. They may have been here last night. May I? Let's see. Yeah, right here, Martin and Ellen Reeves. - It's Mommy and Daddy! - We found 'em. All right, what room are they in? - Sorry, young man, they are not here in the hotel anymore. Not since yesterday. - Now we're really gonna be in trouble. They're gonna go home, and we're not gonna be there. - I don't think they left. - Okay, I'm stumped. What do you think? - I think they're still around. - Okay. Of course! I get it. - Get what? - This place. It's like one of those, um, you know, like Colonial Williamsburg. - You think this is a theme park? - Well, what do you think happened? That we've traveled back in time? That we've entered another dimension? Please, come on. These people, they dress up in costumes and pretend like it's the Wild West. It's a, what do you call it? Like a historical recreation. Check it out. Hey, Hop-along, what year is this? - What? It's 1882. Any fool knows that. - Right, right. Look at us. Look at the way we're dressed, huh? You know what this is? That's a digital wristwatch, baby. You know what digital means? - Can't say I do. Evenin'. - Well, don't you get it? There's no way they would accept us this easy if this place was really for real. It's just for fun, you know? It's like a make-believe trip to the Wild West. - How come no one's trying to sell us tickets? - I don't know, Mom and Dad must have paid for it. They probably stumbled in here, spent the night, and next day they went home. Probably right around the time we were leaving. Okay, you two go find a phone. Call home, tell 'em what happened, and tell 'em we're all right. - Yeah, but we're not. - Yes, we are. Look, I'm the big brother. Just do what I say, okay? I'm gonna go get us checked into the hotel, because I'm not driving anymore tonight. - But how do you explain-- - No, no, no, no, the explaining is done. Let's go, people. Let's move it, chop, chop. - How you doin'? Sign at the top? - That's right. You should read what it says there. - All right, what do we got here? The below signed agrees to the terms and conditions enumerated within, yadda, yadda, yadda. How much are we paying for this palace anyway? - Beg pardon, sir? - How much for the room? - 20 cents a night, sir. - Boy, I tell ya, you guys are really a hoot. I guess the real bill comes at checkout. - I'm afraid we're going to need the signatures of the others. - Right, well, I don't exactly know where they are. Fact is, I don't exactly know where I am, if you know what I mean. - I'm afraid we need the signatures of everyone staying at the hotel, sir. No signatures, no key. - Wanna bet? Yo, all right, I got everything under control here. Where have you been? - Looking for a phone. - Yeah, and getting laughed at. - If you ask me, they're carrying this whole historic recreation thing a little too far. It's no wonder Mom and Dad couldn't call. There's no phones. What a pain in the butt. Well, I don't know about you two, but I'm so tired I can't hardly see straight. I'm gonna mosey on upstairs and go to bed. Well, come on, y'all. Don't get up, no luggage. (ominous music) - [Man] Good evening to you, ma'am. - [Woman] Good evening. - What you lookin' at, Arnie? - See him? In a couple seconds, a lady's gonna walk by, and he's gonna say good evening to you, ma'am. She'll say good evening and walk by in the other direction. - [Man] Good evening to you, ma'am. - Good evening. - [Arnie] Told you. - Cool, how'd you do it? - That's like the fifth time I've seen him do it. They just keep walking up and down the street, crossing at the same spot every time, doing the same stuff over and over again. - Maybe they just hate to say good bye. - But it's the same with everybody out there. Even the horses do the same stuff over and over again. It's like they're zombies or something. - Zombies? You're startin' to scare me, Arnie. - This place is starting to scare me. I don't care what Mike says, it's no theme park. I don't think Mom and Dad ever left here. (light chiming music) See her? She's gonna stop and adjust her stocking and continue down the street. - She didn't adjust her stocking. - You're right, she didn't. Hey, Mike. Mike? - [Cindy] Where'd he go? - [Arnie] I don't know. Better stop him before he gets down there. (dramatic orchestral music) - Stop! - Excuse me, sir, we're looking for our brother. He came down here just a minute ago. - Sorry, young man, I didn't notice. By the way, there's a hotel rule that all residents must sign the register. - Later, okay? We have to find our brother. (dramatic orchestral music) - I'm afraid I'll have to insist. Signatures, please. - What's the big deal, Arnie? Just sign the book and let's go. - No. - I'm afraid I'll have to insist. - Leave him alone! Please, let him go! - [Clerk] Signatures. - Leave my brother alone! (screeching) Oh my gosh, I think I killed him. - You couldn't have killed him. He wasn't alive. Come on, we gotta get Mike. (hissing) (groaning) - Mike! - Mikey! Mikey! - Mike. - Mikey! - Wake up, Mike. It's like he's under some kinda spell. He's been acting strange ever since he signed the register. That's it, he signed the book. The gas station attendant told us not to promise anything to anybody. Signing the register is signing a contract. It's a promise. Wait here. (dramatic orchestral music) I tore out the page. - You gotta stop him. Mikey, wake up. Mikey! - What? What are you guys doin' here? What the? (growling) Talk about ugly. That thing's worse than my math teacher. - Come on, Mikey. - I was right, it was the book. - What book? - The hotel register. Tearing out the page with your name on it broke the spell. - What spell? - You should've seen yourself, man, you were like a zombie. - Maybe that's what happened to Mom and Dad. - [Arnie] Let's find out. (screeching) - I'm sorry. I'm afraid I have to insist to have your signature. I'm sorry. I'm afraid I have to insist to have your signature. I'm sorry. I'm afraid I have to insist... (ooze seeping) - Call me crazy, but this is not normal! - Mike, we've gotta find Mom and Dad, remember? - Yeah, and you got everything under control, remember? - Right, I'm in control. I'm in control. Okay, the concierge was just eaten by the floor, but I'm in control. - Mikey, get a grip, you're our big brother, remember? - I got an idea. How about you be the big brother for a while? - You guys, look, they're coming this way. - Hello, it's a lovely night. - [Arnie] How the heck are we gonna barricade this place? - You're supposed to be the genius. You figure it out. - [Arnie] Maybe we should just make a run for the car. - It's pretty far away. What are they, huh? What the heck are they? - They're like you were five minutes ago. - I don't think they're coming this way. - Maybe it's a decoy. Maybe they're trying to surround us or something. - Good evening to you, ma'am. - [Woman] Good evening. - I don't get this. - It's like the town became active for a minute. I don't think anything around here is what it looks like. It's like-- - Like what? - It's like the people are just shells. Maybe they were alive once, but whatever took over the town took them over too. - You've been watching too many Freddy Krueger movies. - I'm telling you, they're like pod people. - Pod people? - Think of a fungus. - Actually I'd rather not. - You know how a fungus infects a log and starts taking over the log and dissolving away the wood? Until finally it looks like a log, but it isn't. It's just fungus. - But these aren't logs. These are people. - At least they used to be. Gimme your knife. - What are you gonna do, whittle a log? - Just give it to me. (ominous music) (ooze seeping) Oh, yuck. - Oh, yuck. (ooze seeping) - See? The chair, the wall, the people, it's all the same stuff. All the same thing. - So it's like the whole town is one giant living thing. And the people and the furniture, they're all a part of it. - Yeah, and you wanna know what the crazy part is? - That's not crazy enough? - The town responds to us like our bodies respond to a foreign substance. First it tries to take us over, but in order to do that, we have to agree. We have to sign a paper or make a promise, like what a body can't digest, it fights. Like white blood cells or antibodies. You know, basic biology. - Yeah, basic for you maybe. - Maybe we ought to just get back to the car. It might be a little bit safer. - That's what I call good thinkin'. (lively piano music) Oh, thank goodness. I thought the car might be gone. Come on, guys, get in. - [Cindy] Hey, wait a second, what about Mom and Dad? - Look, Cindy, if we don't get out of here right now, we're gonna end up just like they did. However they ended up. Then we won't be able to help them, and they won't be able to help us. Look, I think we should just get out of here. - I don't think so. - Well, I do, now let's go. - So it's a stupid idea to find Mom and Dad? - It is if we get killed while we're doing it. (dramatic western music) - Look, if we leave now, that's the end of Mom and Dad. And I'm not goin'. - Neither am I. - So you with us or what? - Okay. If they destroyed the book, that would've broken the spell on Mom and Dad like you said, but it didn't. So that means the book must still be around. - Yeah, but where? - I told you guys, down below. - So the trick is getting down there without getting eaten. - Even if we could get down there, we'd have to find the book, and then find Mom and Dad, and then get back up here and somehow escape from this town. (gun clicking) And I don't think we can do any of that. - Whoa, slow down. All right, let's just figure out how we get down there first. - They were taking you to the funeral parlor. - Get down! (gunshots banging) Come on, guys, this way. What is this thing? - Some kind of membrane. - [Mike] Up there. Move it, Einstein. - Come on, Cindy. - Come on, let's go, let's go. - [Arnie] Come on, hurry, hurry. Get down! (gunshots banging) Get down, stay down! Let's go. - Hurry! - [Arnie] Come on, come on. Stay down. - [Mike] Here we go. Hang on, Arnie. Hey, guys, we should go this way down the stairs. Come on, out that way. - Wait. - Hey, I can't serve you, you're too young. - I don't want your whiskey. I want the gun. - I got a feeling this might come in handy. Arnie! Squirt, get behind us. What are you doin', waitin' for them to draw first? Shoot! (gun clicking) - The guns don't work either. They're just like the people. (fleshy squishing) (screeching) (flames crackling) (screeching) - [Mike] Come on, this way. - [Arnie] Where are we going? - [Mike] Where do you think? - [Arnie] If I knew, I wouldn't ask. (ominous music) Here it is. - I'll check in the back. Hey guys, take a look at this. I guess this is the way down. - [Arnie] Somehow I've lost faith in your sense of direction. - Grab that lamp, and let's go. - [Arnie] After you. - [Mike] Uh uh, after you. (explosion booming) (dramatic western music) (growling) - Oh, hang on. Listen. - It's breathing. - There's a pulse. - This is really staring to get creepy. - Relax, guys, I've got everything under control. - That's what I'm afraid of. - Hey, check this out. Well, we got a couple of different tunnels here. We gotta pick. - Oh, come on, not that. - Look, odds we go left, evens we take the right one. One, two, three, shoot. Four. We take the right one. - Nothing like a scientific methodology. It's like the guy at the gas station said. There was a whole city here thousands of years ago, and then it got swallowed up just like that town. Hey, guys, was evens left or right? Don't fool around, guys, come on. Guys? - Hey, Arnie, what do you think these things are? Arnie? Where's Arnie? - Where's anybody? - I thought he was right behind you. - I thought he was. - Oh, great, now we got three people lost. Arnie! Where the heck are ya? - Arnie! - Guys? Guys? Come on, guys. Arnie to guys. - [Cindy] Arnie! - [Mike] Arnie! - He has a beeper. - Oh, good idea, we'll just page him with that phone we don't have. (ominous music) (screeching) - [Arnie] Mike? - Those things, they must be nerves or something. - Well, whatever they are, my nerves are quivering too. - We probably shouldn't go this way. - [Cindy] Great idea. - [Mike] Arnie! Arnie, Arnie! - [Arnie] Mike? Mike, Cindy? - Arnie! - Dad, Mom. - What are you doing here? - Mike and Cindy and I came looking for you. - And where are they? - I don't know, we got separated. - Well, we'll find them later. Right now, we're getting you out of here. This way. - [Mike] Arnie! - And then we were looking for the book, the book that you signed. Because I figured if we destroyed the page with your name on it, then you'd be free maybe, like Mike. - You can tell us all about it in the car. - How did you find your way here in the first place? - Well, there was this guy. Some guy at the gas station. He told us. He said you had to dream your way here. - He said that? - Well, I didn't know what he meant at first, but Mike fell asleep at the wheel of the car. I mean, just for a second, like Mom said you did. And then we were lost. Must have dreamed us here. More of a nightmare if you ask me. - Hop in. - Wait a sec, what about Mike and Cindy? - Well, we'll get you out first. Now listen, Arnie, I need you to promise that you'll do exactly like we say. - But Dad-- - Don't worry about Mike and Cindy. We'll take care of 'em. But you have to promise to do what we tell you. Do you promise? - Sure I... - Arnie, you have to promise. (ominous music) (squishing) - Come on. Come on out of there. Come on. You have to promise. - Promise. Come here. Come here. Arnie, you have to promise me. Terrific. Ladies first. - Thanks a lot, Mike. - [Mike] Watch your head. - Mikey, I hear something yucky. - What do you mean? - Listen. (growling) - There, let's go. Careful. It smells like something died in here. - Where did you come from? - I'm here to help. Don't you trust me? - I can't even trust my own parents. Why would I trust you? - You're not ready. To find true courage, one must dig deep into their soul. - I don't understand. - Dig deep. In the pocket, kid. - This symbol, I've seen it before. What does it mean? - In time, you'll know. - Will you stop talking in riddles? I need help. I thought I had this place all figured out, but now I don't know. - Knowledge is not always enough. Whatever lies below, you must have courage to face it. To fight it. - I don't even know what it is. - Arnie, you must see it through. Behind blind eyes lies much sight. - What does that mean? - Nothing, I just like the sound of it. You ready to face death? - Will you help me? - I'll be with you in spirit. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Cindy] Maybe you shouldn't touch it. - You're right, you touch it. - On the other hand, you are the big brother. Go ahead. I think we found the sheriff. - Yeah, happy trails. I think there's one of these for every person up above. This must be where they get taken over. Where they get copied. - Yeah, like pod people. - Yeah. Mom. It's Mom! - It's Daddy! Mike, hurry, get them out! Be careful, don't cut her. - It's not cutting at all. - Well, the book. Arnie said to tear a page out of the book. - I don't know where the book is anymore. - It's gotta be down here someplace. - Well then you play librarian and find it. - Okay, I will. If I were a book, where would I be? Found it! (screeching) Come on, we gotta get it. Doesn't it seem like it's waiting for us? - Yeah, come on, let's play follow the leader. - Okay. I think we got it cornered. - Be careful, could be more of those monsters near. (growling) (screaming) - Mikey, help me! - I can't, it's got me too. Let us go! (laughing) (growling) What is that? - Let us go, let us go! - Don't look at it, whatever it is. - Mikey, I'm sinking! - Hang on! - I'm sinking, Mikey, help! - I can't get loose. (growling) - You want me? Come and get me. (laughing) Come on. Come on. Come on. Shoot me, come on. Come on, shoot me. Come on, shoot me. (gunshot banging) (screeching) - Bullseye! (screaming) Arnie! - You can stop it. Use the... - The what? - Use the... - Come on, Einstein, use the what? - Rattle. - Rattlesnake. Rattlesnake, of course. Cindy, quick, get the tooth. - I can't reach it. - You gotta try. Come on, keep going. - I can't reach it, I can't reach it! - Cindy, throw me the tooth. Cindy, throw me the tooth! Just do it. (squishing) (screeching) That's right! (dramatic orchestral music) (rumbling) The tooth, it was the same as the ones in the pit. A snake can die from its own bite. That's what the guy at the gas station said. - That's what this thing is doing now, dying. We shouldn't be in here while it does it. - Yeah, the book. Arnie, flat. (screeching) - Stab it! (speaking gibberish) - Come on, Cindy, we gotta find Mom and Dad. Arnie, wait! - What? That's the way out. - I know, but we found Mom and Dad, and they're not that way. - Where? - I don't know, I think that way. - [Cindy] Come on, you guys, let's go. - Are you sure? - Yeah, come on. - Come on. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Mike] Arnie, over there, get Dad. - Dad. - Mom, you all right? - Yeah, I think so. - Let's go. This whole place looks like it's gonna cave in. Hurry up, you guys. - Come on. - Cindy, the stairs. - [Cindy] I can't see 'em. - [Mike] Let's get out of here. Let's go. Car's over there. Y'all get Dad in the back. - [Cindy] Mike, there's an arm in the car. - [Arnie] Don't worry about it, Cindy. - [Mike] Come on, guys, go. (screeching) (dramatic western music) (engine revving) - [Dad] Mike. Mike? (squishing) - Yeah, there's a new sheriff in town. - Mike, watch out, the membrane. - I see it. Let's see if it's stronger than a Chevy Impala. (squishing) (screeching) We're out, we're out, woo! We're through, woo! - [Arnie] All right, guys, let's go home. - I don't believe it. I don't believe it. - Arnie, is it gone? Is it dead? - Maybe, I don't know. - It's close enough for me. - Mike-- - Yeah, we'll tell you about it later, Dad. You two just get some sleep, okay? - Yeah, okay, but you watch the speed limit. - Don't worry, Dad, we've got it all under control. - Yeah, just like always. (hard rock music) - Marty, I gotta tell ya, I had those sheriff people hopping. I said you find my brother, you find him right now. And here you are. I get results. What are brothers for, huh? - Thanks, Jack. - Come on, let's dance. ♪ Never know what he's gonna do ♪ - Got any cheese puffs? - Check the kitchen. - Let me check on the roast. ♪ Watch out for what he does ♪ - Feels good to be rockin'! - Feels good to be living. - Come on, man, you were never really afraid, were you? I had everything under-- - If you say under control one more time, I'm gonna splatter you with my guitar. - [Mom] Who wants cake? - [Cindy] I do, I do! - Looks good. - There's nothing like being home. - You can say that again. - There's nothing like-- - Aw. (laughing) You want a big piece? - Yeah, real big. - Okay. (ominous music) (screaming)
