OF LIFE AND DEATH I wonder how it happened. It's sabotage, of course. What else could it be? Could also be an accident. A biscuit? It was an ammunition train. I think it's horrible. Never mind about that... Let's just enjoy ourselves. Well, I think he's awful. Awful? On your honeymoon? Shame on you, Mr Jonsson! No, not him. But Mr Granlund says the accident was sabotage. Sabotage? That's stupid. Don't listen to that whippersnapper. Didn't I say that? You should be careful what you say, Mrs Lewen. Or keep your voice down. Listen, my young friend, you're far too young to criticise me If I think you're a whippersnapper, I'll say that. Oh? That's the difference in out upbringing. Even if I thought you were a bitch, I wouldn't say it out loud. Really! Just because you're young and inherited a company doesn't mean you have to be called a whippersnapper. I totally agree with Kirre. Old people don't have any respect for the young. It may not always be that easy to have it. Was that a dig at me? Arenâ€™t you finished yet? We can catch up with you. You'll join us, won't you, Kirre? - I don't think so. - What do you mean? You have to practice standing on the slopes! I'd rather be sitting down. I can't do that after Nisinsnaska. - Tsasinnjaska is the name! - Well, it hurt, anyway. Are you still not ready? Can't I skip this? I'll break my neck. In that case, I promise we'll send a wreath. Be happy that we want you with us. Only so that you'll have someone to laugh at. Now we'll have an easy run downhill. Keep your skis together. - Is that the way we have to go? - That's the general idea. You have to try. What have I done to deserve this? Why did I get myself into this?? Are you scared? Scared? No, I'm terrified. - See you down there. - Don't be too sure. Hurry up, Kirre. We're freezing! Yeah... who isn't?! Come on! Look out! 'tenshun! Platoon... You're to go back now and check your weapons and kit. I'll be taking the platoon, equipped for the two-day march, at 0730 tomorrow... for handover to the new platoon leader, 2nd Lt Holm... ...who's coming on the evening train. Sandstrom and Pettersson... ...are to be at the office at 1900 hours... ...to pick up the ensign's baggage. By the right, quick march! Hey, boys... Anyone have any idea what sort of guy Holm is? Just another conscript ensign. Not regular army? Will he fit in here? We'll get to teach him how to ski. I know just the slope. 'tenshun! Platoon... At ease. Pettersson... A message has come from regiment HQ. Rejection? No, your application is granted. You can leave Friday night. I can go home? Thank you, sergeant. I know how much you've looked forward to it. Congratulations! Imagine! Home again on Saturday. In proper clothes, missus on my knee... And I get to see Lill-Petter for the first time. It's too good to be true. Comrades... Gentlemen... Moments like these, one never forgets. First day in long pants... Your first experience of love... And when he gets demobbed. We have suffered with Peterson. Through snapshots we have followed Lill-Petter. How he's grown from 3,460 grams... No, 3,760. Yes, I'm sorry. From 3,760 to 5,340. We appreciate the idea of 5 kilos in these days of rationing. Four cheers for Peterson's reunion with wife and bub. Hurra, Hurra, Hurra, Hurra! Do you also think it was sabotage? It seems the most likely. We'll see what comes out of the report. But there was a secret transmitter that was in operation. There doesn't have to be a connection. But then, it was the first time it was heard from. Was it traced? It's somewhere in Stockholm. Before the radio cars could get out, it had stopped transmitting. Damned bad luck. Sure is. We want to know who's transmitting and who's receiving. Come in. Captain, 2nd Lt Holm reporting. - Welcome. - Thank you, Captain. - Good trip? - Yes thanks. Holm is our new platoon leader. Holm, this is Lt Lonnback. Haven't we met before? I was under you when I was conscripted. So you were. - I won't take any more of your time. - Good night, Captain. Sit down, Holm. If I might suggest, so that it will be easier... You went to Karlberg? Yes, six months of training. We don't have time for more, unfortunately. I have my own, thanks. You'll get a real baptism of fire, here. Your platoon will do shooting practice... ...and after that, a 30-kilometre march. Sergeant Lundblad set up exercise. Then it will be overnight in the mountains. I guess you're good with skis? Yes, Captain. Good enough, anyway. I could probably be a bit fitter. I'm unfamiliar with the conditions around here. That's understandable. You'll have a very good deputy, in Sergeant Lundblad. Don't hesitate to ask him, if you're unsure about something. Of course, Captain. There should be two men waiting outside for you. It's getting late. You have a long day ahead of you. Good night. All the best. Listen... Captain? One more thing. That train accident that happened last night... It was probably no accident. Saboteurs are active. Keep your eyes open. Report anything suspicious. Anything you see. You don't believe that any of our boys...? I believe nothing. We must ever observe the utmost vigilance. Yessir! Good night. - A3. - Miss. - But C8, then? - C8... Miss. F10. Hit submarine. Infantryman 83 Peterson reporting. Good. My luggage is in the hall. Follow me with it. Yessir! Where are you off to, boys? A plane has crashed. Seems pretty lively around here. Train and plane crashes a day apart. Yes, Ensign, We're not far from the Norwegian border. 'tenshun! Leader, 2nd Commando Platoon. -- 'tenshun!! 'tenshun! Good morning, men. Good morning, Sir. Platoon... I'm Ensign Holm, and I'll be in charge of you for the next 6 months. I hope we'll get along, and work well together. The first step in the two-day exercise is to be field shooting on patrol. MARKSMANSHIP - 8am - 1pm Anything for me, Miss? Yes, a registered letter. There you are. What was that? The thing you just stuck in your pocket? Just a bill I received just now. They have shooting practice. Shall we watch? I don't know... No, what if you got shot? - Darling, I shan't get shot! - You never know! Are you coming to see the shooting practice? So long as there aren't any birch trees in the way. Isn't it dangerous? Are we able to do that? We needn't get too close. Their artillery fires a long way. Artillery? Advance for shooters... 200. Target on far right... 100. Fire! Cop this, you ugly bastard! How about the right eye as well?! Yeah... little happier, please. They're shooting really well today. What now? Have we got a audience? We'd better get rid of them. It's so loud! Please, can't we go home? There's no danger. Glad we're not a target. Here comes a guy to move us on, I'd say. I'm sorry, but you can't be here. You'll have to be on your way. Please, Ensign, we'll just stay here. You're not allowed to be here. If I asked you really, really nicely? Gittan, come on now. Keep your flirting for Saturday's dance. - Are you coming on Saturday, Lieutenant? - I'm an Ensign. Would you please do as I ask. You're all to leave this area right away. What a meany! But awfully cute, actually. Pity he's only an ensign. They're so common this year. Are civilians always such a nuisance? Yeah... anything's possible. They get themselves lost sometimes and we have to go find them. They should be forbidden from going out alone. They don't always know what they're getting into. - How are you feeling, Kirre baby? - Don't do that! Order me an orange drink, would you please? Mr Persson, I must ask you... I need some help with this yarn. It's got all tangled. Hop to it, Lasse!... Give Mrs Lewen a hand. Hold this... No, not like that! This is the way to do it. Hello. Enjoying yourself? Was the shooting exciting? We were forced to leave. By a cute little Ensign. Oh, he wasn't so little. He was awfully cute. If only he'd been a lieutenant. Two more orange drinks. Lasse, where have you been today? I had some training on the slopes. Has anyone lost a notebook? - I found it outside. - No. I don't carry one. Maybe it's Kirre's. I wonder if there's anything in it. A-K-2, B-6, A-C-C? Isn't it impolite to read other people's notes? Are you solving mathematical equations? I was peeping in your notebook. Mine? No, this is not mine. Miss, give this to Miss Winberg. Tell her it was found. Darling, I'll just duck out and buy some papers. - I'll come with you. - No, don't do that... You'll catch a chill. Jonseman, you don't want me with you? Are you already tired of me? Snookums, how can you think something like that?! Bye for now! Goodbye. Hi, I'm picking this up. A small squarish package. Careful with it. It's fragile. - There you are. - Thanks. - Thank you, Sergeant. - Shouldn't we take a break? Thinking of me? Of everyone. It's not suitable here. - We'll soon be there. - Will we? We'll keep going. Well, Sandstrom, how does it taste? Good, Sergeant, with a bit more salt. Thanks, Sandstrom. Sorry, but are you making a ballroom here, Sir? Maybe it's big enough now. There's room for four... but only you and the sergeant will be sleeping in it. It's starting to feel quite homely. Yes, I'm going to miss this. You're leaving us, Pettersson? Day after tomorrow. For months I've been longing for my wife and Lill-Petter. "Lill-Petter" That's right, you don't know. He's our kid. I've only seen him in a photo. Then I can understand how you'd want to get home. At the same time I can't help feeling pretty low about leaving. Living in the wilderness gets in your blood. Sure does. They can be a bitch sometimes, but there's something special about the mountains, the emptiness, and everything. And the boys of course. They'll be missed. Along with the duty. Ensign...! - Chow's on! - Thanks. Thanks for the help, Pettersson. How are you finding him? He seems a bit pooped. That's only to be expected. There's been some steep climbing. How will he be taking the lead, though? Sarge will probably take the easier route. What is it? Thursday. Don't tell me it's pork and peas! That smells good to me! Same old dishes as usual. Enough to drive you crazy! I'm starting to feel homesick for the "Royal". I'll say! And all this fresh air's so dangerous. It can debilitate the strongest of us. I don't understand why they have to move us every day... Here. I think we'll enjoy this meal, don't you agree... ...old girl? What's bugging you today, my pet? I know you're hiding something from me. Darling, you mustn't be like that! I saw you fooling around with something in the closet. And why did you keep your suitcase locked? Can you keep something absolutely to yourself? Yes, what is it? I'm the saboteur they talk about. What?! I have dynamite in my suitcase. What are you saying?! Enough to blow the shop to smithereens. What shop? Darling, I'm kidding you! Don't do that... You scare me! A saboteur is not going to admit to it! How am I supposed to know that? Hey... do you think the ensign will come on Saturday? Which one? You needn't play dumb... I saw how interested you were. Gittan, sometimes you're unbearable. Don't be like that... we both like cute guys. Don't say that... you'll make me blush. If Kirre was a lieutenant, I'd marry him. Then I'm lucky I didn't join the army. Don't you want to marry me? Nor jump off the Eiffel Tower, either. You're mean! You're too childish to even think of marriage. - Not at all! - Oh yes! I maybe look quite young. But I have an awfully old mind. That reply definitely calls for another drink. Would you take my mess-kit with you? I'm going down to my quarters. You check the bivouacs, Sergeant. We'll rise at 6. You don't snore, do you, Sergeant? Not that I know of. Good night, Ensign. - Goodnight, boys. - Good night, Ensign. He won't need any sleeping pills tonight. Everybody up! It's 6 o'clock! Berra, wake up! Get moving, slowcoaches! What is it? Grub time? It's 6 o'clock! Thanks, we're awake. Ensign? Ensign Holm! What? Good morning, Sergeant. I didn't sleep well, last night. Yes, I heard that. Do you mean I snored? Yeah... a bit. I was so damned tired yesterday. But... where did I put my ski-boots? I packed them away. Otherwise they wouldn't have been much good for you today. We'd best go over today's program. The first 20km is uphill, right? Then two ways downhill to choose from. One is 10km longer, but much less steep So which one? There's nothing stopping us taking the longer way Not that much time difference Why not the shorter, anyway? There are some pretty steep drops. Are you worried about the boys? About the boys? Not at all. Well don't fret about me I shan't try to race anyone. Hey, are you sure this run is easy? Yes, I told you it was. The worst you can do is fall over. It's not so funny after 400 times. You packed mine, too, eh? Coming with us today? No, I'll go on my own. I've already done that particular run. - Not beyond you? - I don't think so. Isn't it a bit silly to go off on your own? Have you never done it. Sure. - I ski as well as you do. - Not quite. Well, quite well enough. Don't you worry. Do what you like. No one want to come? Forget it. See you later. - Just be careful! - Sure. Repeat... Sergeant in the lead. Poor thing... He doesn't dare. We'll probably change to the other way. Otherwise we'll be sending him home in a box, on tomorrow's train. This is somewhat steeper than I expected. Maybe best we take the longer route anyway? The turnoff is half an hour back. It looks like a snowstorm coming in. We shan't take the risk. We'll re-assemble at the bottom. Just take it carefully. Don't stand there staring. Get going! A nice little hill, that. Yeah... - Thank God we got home OK. - Just in time. Ulla, Miss Sjovall back? No, I haven't seen her. Wasn't she with you? No, she's be running into a headwind the whole way home. That wouldn't bother her. Sure. Isn't she home within an hour we'll need to search. Warn Kalle and Birger. That serious? We'd better tell the army. I hate having to bother them again. That was a shitty bit of weather. Sure was. I couldn't see 2 metres in front of me. 'Tenshun! Exercise completed. First and second sections to the sauna. By the right, quick march! You were great on that downhill run. Put us others to shame. Where did you learn to ski like that? I had a lot of school excursions in the mountains. I've taken lots of holidays there. I've done 12-14 trips up this way. But I always get stiff in my legs. The sauna will fix that. Come in. Message from HQ. Two patrols are needed to search for a tourist. She's got herself lost. Very good. Well then... Forget about the sauna. I can take one group and Hagberg the other... So you can stay here. No, I'll go. Of course it had to be some dollybird... She should get a good spanking. Pick 9 men. Volunteers if possible. Pettersson... Are you going to leave these behind when you go? Can I swap with you? You're are much better. - Yeah, sure. - You're a pal! 'Tenshun! Platoon... A tourist has gone missing. I need 3 men. Any volunteers? Sergeant. Get ready as quickly as possible. Looks like I'll need them one more time. You get them tomorrow, Berra. We meet here. You take the sandwiches and I'll take the thermoses. I should have forbidden her. You'd have no right to forbid her. Karin! - How are you? - You look exhausted! It's quite alright. I turned back when I saw the storm coming. Well done. Give her a hand. Number 11. Check her for frostbite. This is Persson. Have the patrols left? Damnation! She's arrived home. Try and stop them, if it's possible. Bugger! They've left. The exercise will be good for them. Andersson... you take the north side. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help me... Nothing? Thanks anyway. They haven't found him? Something must be done. They've searched all night. Is there nothing we cab do?! No, nothing except wait. Why don't you go and lie down for a while? Calm yourself down. Do you imagine I could sleep now?! Dear God, don't let anything happen to him! Calm yourself down. He's probably alright. Would you mind turning that off? Are YOU going to start with that, now!? That guy should have been leaving the army today. Well he he has, hasn't he? Do you know what you are? You are stupid, vacuous and a bitch. Who doesn't cry about a stranger having an accident? It'd be better if it was you. You're drunk. You here the truth from children and drunks. Existence is meaningless. People are dying morning, noon and night. That's what so goddamned terrible... WAR. People killing each other, just so some... No, your too young to understand. Kirre!... Have you become a conchy? No, but I have ideals, however strange that may seem. Goodnight. Good evening. Who is it? Only me. May I come in? Dear child... You mustn't cry any more. You need to sleep. I can't sleep! It should have been me that died instead! There, there. I understand how you feel. But you can't help that the accident occurred. No, but if I hadn't gone out alone... ...it never would have happened. Why did it have to happen? Well.. When one gets to be as old as I am, there's no point any more in asking "why". Hear that? What is? It sounds like someone telegraphing. Someoneâ€™s probably left a radio on. You try and sleep now. Then you'll feel better in the morning. I'm sure I won't... but thanks anyway. Goodnight, sweetheart. Goodnight, Mrs Lewen. Hi! What can I do for you? I'm here to see the company chief. What's new? If it hadn't been for that accident... A terrible business. I want to speak with that girl. Have you heard? That transmitter has been active again. A lot of suspicious things have been happening. Are you coming to the dance this evening? - I don't think so. - Why not? Alright then. Got your chosen one? Could be! She not coming? What? Is she not coming... your chosen one? She's likely returned home. She still might turn up. I'll go and have a shot at tripping the light fantastic. May I have the honour? - Certainly, Ensign. - It's Lieutenant Lonnback. You're a lieutenant? Lovely! - Wasn't this our dance? - Next one, Kirre, next one! Show you how a uniform can be useful. Where's Miss Sjovall this evening? She's in the lounge. She didn't want to come down. Why don't you try and persuade her? I guess I can try. - Have you been a lieutenant long? - Yes, about a year. Isn't it dangerous, if there should be war? Let's hope it doesn't happen. Isn't it terrifying? Haven't you heard of "the Swedish tiger"? - I'm dumbstruck. - So am I. Aren't you coming down to join us? Sorry Kirre, I don't want to. You don't have to dance. You'll only get more depressed sitting, thinking about it. Come along. There's an admirer waiting for you down there. Who? You'll see who it is when you come down. Come along! Ensign Holm. May I have the honour? No thanks. A dance would do you good. I'd rather us sit. Don't give up. A girl like her needs to be persuaded. Kirre! I'm still here. Go and dance with the nice ensign. Off you go! Why were you so reluctant to dance with me? Why didn't you want to? I don't know. That man wasn't your fiance, was he?? Not at all. It was just an emotional thing. Do I seem so repulsive? No. Really, all I want to do is forget about the reason. You aren't engaged, are you Lieutenant? - Oh no. - How come? I just haven't met the right one for me. I've done a cooking course. And I really love children. Are you staying long up here? Another 10 days. But I can't wait to get away from here. Why? Because of that boy's accident. How does it affect you personally? I was the one they were searching for. - Was it YOU? - Yes. What the hell got into him? Youngsters, youngsters...! You should have heard her! She'll be posting our banns before long. Why looking so glum? Didn't finish the dance? I left her on the dance floor, Are you enemies already? In the melodramas, that doesn't happen till Act 2. She was the cause behind Pettersson's death. All because of her stupidity. That's why you stopped dancing with her? Is that a feeling of duty? It's too easy to judge. Yes, in this case. She's been down at Astrom to ask if she could help the family. She's utterly shattered. She should be. The girl was most unlucky, and you have to carry on like an oaf towards her! Totally oafish! As if she isn't going through hell already. Do the right thing and apologise. I didn't know she'd been to Astrom. All right. Who is it? Forgive me for behaving so stupidly. I'm truly sorry. But the death of that boy and the way it happened, got me so upset. You don't have to explain. If I were you, I'd have felt exactly the same It was stupid of me to see you as nothing more than a scatter-brained society girl. Tell me you forgive me. Of course. How about we go down? I must look a mess. We can sit somewhere and talk. Yes, I'd like that. Are all the officers as sweet as you? They're much sweeter! They can't be! How long will you be posted here? Quite a long time. Can men posted here, get married? Oh yes, they can. I wonder what Mum and Dad would say. About what? About us getting married, of course. It's after 12... I really just be off. Can't you stay for a little while. Whereabouts is Holm? Holm? He's off canoodling with Karin. I wonder if he can make it home alone. I'm sure he can. Actually, I'd like to become a doctor. A private secretary isn't so bad. No, of course not. Isn't life sometimes empty for an independent young lady? Yes, of course you can be envious of those with a home and children. Hopefully, it's not too late. - How strange! - What is? That I should tell you that. I've never said it to anyone. Who'd be leaving at this time? Maybe a guest who lingered. No, it's after one oâ€™clock. That late?! So we've been sitting here for three hours. So pleasant. Time flies in good company. That was meant as a compliment, not a boast. If we're going to be up early for an outing... ...it's best we go now. I guess you're right I'll fetch you at 10. I think I'll be ready. Thanks for a truly pleasant evening. Thanks yourself. Goodnight. Gosh it's cold! If at least something happened. Take your mind off freezing Hey...! I thought I heard something. Quiet, a moment. No, it was nothing. I'm sure I heard something. What would it have been? Who is it? Only me. How was he? I'm dying of curiosity! Go on dying then! What do you mean? I tell you everything! He was very nice. And my lieutenant. I'm going to bed. Good night. Don't you want to know what he said to me? No. I couldn't care less. He almost proposed to me! Don't rush into it. You might get a chance at a captain. - You know, you're right! - Goodnight! Hey, Berra.. look! What on earth?! Go and report it and come back. Did he go off? I kept an eye on him... He slipped into the hotel. We have his cap. If we find his skis, we can pin him down. This looks like them. Yes, you can tell they've just been used. Wait... I'll put a mark on them. Here they are. I also have a marked pair. - You know what we are? - Completely taken in. Exactly. He's one smart cookie. But we have the cap. Identify all the all the marked skis. Yes, Ensign. Where do I start? No, I don't know whose cap it is. There are so many the same. Yes, it's a common type. Look, it has "LP" here. Who could that be? Lasse Persson, the ski instructor. Is he staying here? Yes, he has a room in the basement. Thanks for your help. - Can we keep this between ourselves? - Certainly. Yes, this is my cap. What about it? Were you out last night, after 1 o'clock? No, I was asleep by 12. Can anyone back you up on that? No. What's this all about? A skier was seen in a forbidden area last night. He fled our patrol and dropped this cap on the way. I can assure you it wasn't me. How do you explain your cap? He took the wrong one. Easy to do. There are many the same, hanging in the hall. And it would have been quite dark. Well, that was all I wanted to ask you. Thanks. Do you believe it was Persson? Not really. He seems a decent sort of chap. Sounded truthful. There were 10 pairs of skis marked? Yes. All done the same way. I wonder what he was up to. Placed an explosive device, perhaps? He wasn't anywhere near the railway embankment. No, that's too closely watched. But then... what if he placed a charge on the slope above it... It explodes... ...starting an avalanche into the embankment. That has to be stopped! Easy to say. A couple of platoons could comb the area today. But they's probably find nothing. It snowed last night. Send the company adjutant in. - Let me know if you find anything. - Yes, Captain. Gosh, I'm thirsty! A drink would go down really well. This is all very exciting. I thought spies and saboteurs only happened in books. No... I really shouldn't have said anything to you about it. Maybe I'm the mysterious X-27! The girl with the innocent smile. Wait... maybe you could be useful. Sherlock Holmes needs a Watson... Do you think it's Persson? Not at all. Me neither. But on the other hand... ...what do we know about the skier? Our mysterious skier. Well, we know he's a very good skier. His skis are marked. He took Persson's cap. Yes... I just thought of something. You spoke of a secret transmitter. The other evening, Mrs Lewen and I suddenly heard something that went... What?! We thought it was a radio. Certainly sounds like a receiver. Where was it coming from? I don't know. You couldn't tell. Who is there nearby? Old Mrs Lewen and the Jonsson couple. Gittan Kronberg above. No one below? Yes, Persson's in the basement, right beneath. Wait, we'll compare with my list. Sit over here, so I can see. Jonsson's skis are marked. But maybe he has a different cap. He may have taken another's to lead us astray. Gittan's skis are marked. Who could imagine Gittan as a saboteur?! She doesn't seem very bright, does she? Can be an act. Nobody could act that well. Lewen's probably not a great skier. That only leaves Lasse Persson. Persson or Jonsson, seems to be the choice. - Thanks for today. - Thanks. Now keep your eyes and ears open. Trust your Watson! The list of the ski-owners... Can I borrow it? - You've got a plan? - Maybe I have. Do they know their skis were marked? Only the one who did the new marking. When shall I see you again? Not until Thursday. We've got a training run. - I hope you do yourself proud. - And the same to you. While I'm away I'll leave it to you, Watson, to solve the mystery. I'll do what I can. Bye! Bye bye! Where's Lt Lonnback? He went on ahead. Did you find anything? Nothing at all. What ski-wax are you using today? I'm trying out Lapp-Glide. That's the top one. Did he mark your skis too? What do you mean? Some old guy from the Ski Association was doing an insurance check. Really? Don't know anything about it. The others got left behind. Did he mark your skis too? Who? The railway guy. They put a sticker on when you check in. There are the others. Let's go on. Those exercises are such a bore. I don't see my fiance for 3 days. Does he know that he's your fiance? No it'll be a surprise for him. How smooth a run did you have? - Great. - Me too. Did he mark your skis, too? Who? The guy from the insurance company. No, I haven't seen any marks. Was this guy cute? Cute? Really classy! A cross between Tyrone Power and Cary Grant. You're kidding! Shall we go back now? You're too late... He left yesterday. What a bore! I didn't get to meet him. The Prime Minister's speech has got some notice. Where? London has taken it as a warning to leave Norway alone. Was that what he meant it to be? Hard to say. We have to be prepared for anything. Like, you need to learn to ski properly? No, you can rest assured about that. Speaking of skis... Did yours get marked? Yeah. Cleverly done, eh? Sure was. Imagine the army guys finding 10 marked pairs of skis. Who told you about it? Yes, who was it...? One of the privates. Don't mention it to Holm, eh? The kid could get into trouble. No, I shan't. Trust me. In connection with the battalion's fire attack against the enemy bivouac... ...with ground and paratroops... ...at 5.15, with my platoon I will block the northern part of the pass.... ...and sty my enemy communications. Fire! Battalion HQ. Ensign Holm? They haven't come back as yet. We're expecting them some time today. Tell him to come to Fjallasen as soon as he can. It's desperately important. This is Miss Sjovall. Thank you. Granlund to open. Has to be worth a krona. I'm out. No cards for me. - I fold. - So do I. I raise you a krona, Kirre. And one krona more. You're bluffing, Kirre. I'll raise you. Can I see what you've got? Only if you pay. - Shall we share? - No way. Double the stake? You seem nervous, Kirre. You've chewed up a matchstick. Three jacks is all I have. Excuse me. Two pairs! God, how you bluff! - What's happened? - Come with me. It's you, Kirre. Sorry. - So you think it's Granlund? - Yes. It can't be anyone else His explanation may be true. You think it's impossible he knew about it from anyone else? There's no one. But then... he's such a hopeless skier. That was just faked... Gave him an alibi, whatever happened. Maybe you're right. It makes sense. Good evening. We've no proof. There's nothing we can do. There could be something in his room that would expose him. Yeah... Go back and keep him playing. - I'll be right back. - What'll you do? Find proof... if there is any. Full hand. I have 4 nines. I don't want to play any more! - I thought you'd left us. - I'm back in. I'll just dash upstairs for some cigarettes. Have one of mine. Thanks, but I prefer my own brand. - Kirre? - Yes? Could you be a dear and get me a lemonade? Sure. - Kirre? - Yes? Could you get it now. I'm so thirsty. Alright... - Three kings. - I have three aces. Didn't you have a full hand? Yes, of course. You have it. Here... want a cigarette? How come your hand's shaking? Has the gambling devil got hold of you? Miss Sjovall? Ensign Holm is in the hall, to see you. - Excuse me. - Everybody's running. How did you go. I thought he'd come up and find you. Found nothing.. Nothing? But I have an idea... come on. You're back? 1.50 to play. Why did he have to go again? A train's coming in at 11.30. They have to guard the station. Why would they need to guard it? They can't be too careful. They're frightened that something might happen here. Hopefully it wouldn't be like before. Don't say that, Mr Granlund! So, who's calling? What are you doing here? Calm down No one saw me. I have news. You could tell me tomorrow. I don't want it known that were connected. It will be too late tomorrow. The train comes tonight. Karin told me. 11.30 at the station. - Where from? - Like the last train. How's the weather? Moonlight, worst luck. Don't carry any papers. - In case something happens to me? - Exactly. Don't drop anything. Like what? Like a notebook. An accident. It could have led to prison for both of us. And the ski cap you dropped... For God's sake! That was deliberate! A cap with someone else's initials. I'm scared about Sjovall. She heard the transmission. I don't like her asking about the marks. And I don't like your answer. Train... ...tonight. I told you. 1... ...43. That must be wrong. No, they're never wrong. Never make mistakes. But Holm, then? Don't you understand? They suspect you. They've been fooling you. Looks as though they're trying to catch me out. But they don't know the train will come two hours later. Splendid! That train must not arrive. It won't. I have a strong feeling it will be hit by an avalanche about 1.45. I guess that's enough for tonight. Good night, everyone. What's the time? 20 past 12. Is it that late? Does it matter? Not at all. Poor little Holm... Now he's stuck, freezing, at the station. Poor guy. It's nice for us civilians to have our army. We wouldn't feel so relaxed without them. Have you never been called up? Oh yes. For 6 months, I was looking for secret transmitters. Well I'm gong to bed, too. Goodnight. Pleasant dreams about me. He's actually awfully cute. Very. Sergeant, new orders. Platoon... at the ready! Where are you headed to? There's a train coming at 1.43. - !.43?! - Why? - Is there something...? - No, it was nothing. Good morning, sweetie-pie. Good morning. I had such a good sleep! I wish we could stay another week... It's so lovely and quiet. But what's this about? I'm here with congratulations. What about? Today we've been married a whole two weeks! Have we really been married that long? A little gift... to commemorate the day. Was this what you were putting in your bag? Yes, it wasn't dynamite. But look at this... "Vol de Nuit." Exactly the one I wanted! Darling... Was Holm shot? Yes, and another five seconds and the train would have been hit. Was he badly hurt? No, it wasn't serious. That Granlund was a saboteur... He always seemed a bit of a rotter. I feel sorry for him. Sorry? For a traitor? Good morning. Who has my tickets? Are you leaving us, Mrs Lewen? I don't feel very safe staying here. The whole place could be blown up. To think that I'd chatted with that Granlund person... ...who turned out to be so awful. Oh, I'm so upset! You poor thing, Mrs Lewen. Terrible business. I hope we see you back here. I doubt it very much. Your book is in my room, Miss Sjovall. Thanks for the loan. A pleasure. Have a good journey. Goodbye, Mrs Lewen. Poor old girl. She was terribly upset. You did well, Ensign. So tell me, how long will you be bandaged up? Only a few weeks. Then you'll be ready to get back to field service training. Look after yourself. Hello again. I didn't realise you were on the train. Mrs Lewen, I know why you were at Fjallasen. Yes, my doctor said that I should. Did he also say that you should get Kirre to blow up an ammunition train? What are you talking about? That was the radio transmission we heard... the Morse code. What has that got to do with me? The receiver was in your room. In any case, it would be hard for you to prove now. You can search my baggage if you like... but I assure you that you won't find it there either. You're careful, aren't you! Maybe I am. Granlund wasn't so careful. What do you mean? Recognise it? He stupidly threw it into his wastepaper basket. What's that to do with me? A great deal. He made a few too many notes. Maybe it was deliberate... ...so he could spread the blame. Mrs Lewen, I don't wish to hurt you physically. Let me avoid a nasty fight and press the emergency brake. It'll be the best for you if you own up to it. If you confess, you'll have a better chance at a lighter sentence. I'll hang on to this. The train's stopping. So, are you coming? I hate you. But there are others who can continue my work. They can't stop us. Darling, how are you? I'm OK. Granlund was a poor shot. You sure you're OK? Where have you been all day? I got a saboteur to surrender. Are you serious? One can be as good as another! Come and sit in the sun for a while? Have you been a major long, Major? What? I asked if you'd been a major very long. There wasn't much to it, really. - You know what you are? - Damned stupid? You're the world's most gifted girl. - Gifted?! - Yes. You don't seem very flattered. A girl doesn't want to just be called gifted. Not by a smart young man... ...who'd she'd become interested in. So that's the way it is! Would she rather hear that she is ...cute, nice, soft and feminine? I guess she would. Well, that's what I think. Well, say it then! You are... cute, and nice, and soft and feminine. Yes, and gifted! â™« Your sun arises over evil and good... â™« for the world as well as me. â™« Oh may I have the patience â™« and love that comes from thee. 'tenshun! God save the king and the fatherland! God save the king and the fatherland! Company...! Fellow Rangers... the situation, as you are aware... ...is that the military readiness we maintain, is absolutely necessary. We have had, in recent days, been reminded... ...how every location must be ready... ...to take the initiative. This readiness has not been in vain. It is thanks to it... ..and the sacrifices our people have willingly made and are making... ...that the storm-waves of war have not swept over our country. Till now, only a few sparks from the fires have blown our way. Should the waves of war roll against us in all their violence ...we shall unleash our fighting skills... ...with the same calm determination... that we put into our strenuous and often dangerous mountain maneuvers. Company, move off! First platoon, forward march. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
