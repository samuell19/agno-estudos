PLOVDIV JULY 10TH 1994 Lechkov gets the ball and... GOAL! Leave it there, I know how it works. Now they are going to pay the German team back! Let us see how it goes just twenty minutes before the end of the match. Once again... NIKI ILIEV ALEXANDER KADIEV ORLIN PAVLOV BOYKO KRASTANOV Those are the hardest final minutes... Laura! Laura! - Hey! - It's 2-1 for us! My Dad turned the table over with joy! - We're off to the... hill. - Great. Come on, guys. He is stuttering again. - Bye, Laura. - Bye, guys! DILYANA POPOVA Leave him, Fatty. I was going to tell you, but we got together at the last moment. May I join you? We will be late. Maybe for the semi-finals, should we qualify. BASHAR RAHAL EVELYN KOSTOVA RAINA KARAYANEVA My brother ate those in Hungary! He said they were smashing! ISKRA DONOVA Come on, we told you to leave that loser. He's my cousin after all. STEFAN DANAILOV It was the Bulgarian's misconduct. Time is running out... And that was it! Bulgaria qualifies for the World Cup semi-finals! The best day of my life! It will be when you make sex for the first time. - So you know it all. - I do. The nurse at the doctor's... - No one believes your story. - I know. - I thought you'd take Laura with us. - I thought you'd take her. What for? Laura said she wouldn't make sex before she's turned 17. Stop it! It's just the four of us getting together one last time because we might never see each other again. - Of course we will! - But you are all leaving, aren't you? Then let's make a deal. Should we never see each other again... Which no one believes. Should we never see each other again until we've turned 30 or 40 let's say... - Let us meet again here in... - 25 years. We'll be old men then. We won't be able to climb up to here. - We'll be here again in 25 years. - If we didn't have the Alzheimer's. So it's a deal. One, two, three! THE REUNION PLOVDIV 2019 Fatty? Hey, Fatty! - Fatty! - You're mistaken, man. Oh, sorry, my bad. Just don't take me for a... Come on, it's high time you admitted it! I thought no one else would come. I'm sorry, mister, I don't know what you're talking about. I am to meet a person at least ten years younger. What a coincidence, I'd say the same about you. Deyan? Vicky? Wait a minute, how do I know it is really you? People know me from TV, you know. - From TV? - Stop pretending. How do I know you're not some fans of mine? - Oh, really? - That's exactly what I'm asking. Hey, Diddy! Well, yes... It was expected to be a little awkward. It's been so many years, so it's quite normal. So what do we do now? And where is Fatty? It was his idea after all. - I've organized the reunion. - No, it was him. - I made the group on Facebook. - Wait. Remember how I told you we would be gaga by now? And so it's a fact. Here is Fatty. Still lives in Plovdiv, no profile picture. And he still hasn't died of obesity. Honestly, I don't understand how you make money with that. Why wouldn't I? It's here, isn't it? - I guess it is. - Right. - What's the matter? - What? - Why are we hiding? - Wait. Isn't that him? - He looks a bit like... - His cousin. But it's not him. - Isn't that him? - Are you sure? It's not him. - What is it? - It's a letter of eviction. Fatty! - Hello. - Good morning! We're looking for Fatty. How many times have I told you not to call me that! Alex, is that you? - This is Fatty! - Look at you! Just look at him! - You're so fit! - We won't call you Fatty any more. Call me whatever you like. - He's so fit, he's not Fatty anymore. - Come on in! Honestly, I thought no one would remember our reunion. If it wasn't for Facebook I would've hardly recognized you. - But you'd know me. - Alex. Deyan and I arrived from abroad and I wrote it to you. I came from Sofia and refused a Tashkent tour! Was that your cousin outside? Right. Has he anything to do with this? I'm sorry I stood you up. I just don't feel like meeting people right now. Is this all because of that dumbass? He... He is taking the house. He practically owns it already. You mean this house? But you grew up in here. And more importantly, we grew up in here! Not that it matters more, but... Okay, I shut up. I'm sorry once again that you had to tramp all this way. Alex! I really liked it, Vanya. - It's Tanya. - Yes, of course. Tanya. Listen. Now, when I go to Tajikistan or Kyrgyzstan... What was it? Have they seen the series there? Uzbekistan, yes. Is there someone who... Good morning. So no one knows me there? Wait a minute. Whom am I going to perform for? Bulgarians? In a restaurant? Okay, listen, I accept. But it stays between us, no one should know, okay? Uzbekistan, yes. A star of my class! Okay, bye. The plane will be on autopilot, of course. The cockpit was so small last time. No driver waiting for me? Matthew is still coughing because I didn't take him to a doctor. An apointment that you made, by the way, without even ask me. I'm worried as I don't have abduction and ransom insurance. Say meow. What do you mean no one'd abduct me! Woof! I'll call you back. I'll call you back. I have to go. This is super weird. I'm surprised there's an airport in Tashkent! Very funny! Next, please. Next, please. Next, please. Oh God! My luggage! Now. Taking the house back won't be that easy. Fatty's cousin... I have to stop calling him that. That loser Branimir is not a loser any more. His shares have gone up. Many of the shops in the center turned out to be his property. However, he personally checks each one of them every morning. - The referee totally fucked up. - He was so unfair. Good morning! Welcome to our city! What brings you here? Some fun, eh? Zhoro, come here! - Do you know him? - Who is he? He is the one from... Who were you? - He is Ivan. - I am not Ivan. - He's not Ivan. - No. He's Andrey! - I am not Andrey. - Who are you then? - My name is Angel Damyanov. - Angel Damyanov! Angel Damyanov! Come take a picture. - Okay, I will, but this isn't him. - Wait! - Hey, wait! - Just one picture... How do you follow a person when you are famous? - With a newspaper. - What age do you live in? A tablet would be more realistic. You're such a loser. I was at the rowing base with a newspaper today. Branimir organizes a sports event every year. He's got a sports team and guess who always wins! - Who? - His team! They are all young men in their early twenties. I followed him to the bank. Good morning! Mr. Yossifov is going to see you now. What I saw there... We have all the reasons to be worried. - It's a pleasure working with you. - You too. Have a nice day! So what do we do now? Why are we following him? Why don't we just talk to him? And what shall we tell him, genius? -We simply buy the house back. -Exactly. "Hello, here's the money, thanks, bye." Right. But I am an actor in Bulgaria. How does this sound to you when you add a house buyback? I work in a bank. I know how this works. Working in a bank and owning a bank are two diametrically opposite things. Take a look at this. Consumer loan. Click. Just enter your ID number and you will have the money in 24 hours. Oh God, I'm devastated! When my assistant told me your names I thought she was joking. I can't believe my eyes, a TV star in my office! I'm glad to see you, guys. How long has it been, 15 years? - Twenty years! - Shut up! How time does fly! You must be busy so we'll go straight to the point. I am not busy at all with all these people here working for me. It sounded like I was bragging. Sorry, it's just my ego. We have to celebrate. - We need to drink to that. - Okay. - In fact, no need to. - Fine. But you're missing a lot. - We're here because of Alex. - Yes? Oh, you mean Fatty? I have to stop calling him that, he is so fit now! - He's got an eight-pack. - You don't say! Branko, we know that you own the house now. We're here to buy it back and give it back to Alex. That's very noble of you. The house is his only possession. And we grew up in it, too. Exactly. We have everything prepared. - Yes? - Take a look at the documents. You sign here. And here is the amount. Then you just push this button here... - And you get the money. - The same day! Just look how easy it is! I can't sell you the house, guys. I'm really sorry. - If you want more... - No, it's for business reasons. I'll demolish the house and build quite a profitable hotel there. The house is a cultural monument. Don't be naive! You know how things work. I will burn it, the roof will collapse and the house will be ruined. You may go now. Sorry. I have nothing to say. I do, but I'll keep it to myself. Actually, there's another option. I need to calm down and stop playing that role. It's been twenty years of waiting for this moment, me sipping whiskey and smoking while you're waiting for my decision. It feels so good! After all you did... If it wasn't for you, maybe I wouldn't become so ambitious and successful. But my ego is tickling me to pay you back, to make you depend on me somehow. Can we hear the other option or you'll go on with your sentiments? It was no sentiment, but a monologue of retribution, so to say. Here's the other option: You will participate in a marathon organized by me and you have to qualify in the top three of five competing teams. As a team, the four of you. The same team that wouldn't admit me in. If you succeed in that, I will give the house back to your friend. Ask Vicky for details about the marathon. He was watching me at the rowing base hidden behind a yellow newspaper. It was real fun. And you, Acho, Ivan, Andrey or whatever they called you. It was hilarious being followed by you hiding behind that silly cup. Or you, Mr. Banker with your deep relationship with an ATM machine. You heard my terms. Now off to your training practices or whatever. This feels so great! - No way! - Wait. This is another scheme of Branko's who only wishes to humiliate us. - But we can... - Seriously, guys. I appreciate that, but it's just a waste of time. - This went well. - You think so? - This is sarcasm, Vicky. - Please warn me when you're joking. - If you pay. - I don't have coins. - So what do we do now? - We continue without him. Do you think that was sarcasm? No, it's not! When I say something, I mean it. If we climb the hill like we used to, then we have a chance. Come on! Just a little bit more and we're up. Come on. Guys, I am not here for the sake of the house. Don't misunderstand me, I really appreciate what you're doing. But I can't stand the sight of you embarrassing yourself. Then what do you suggest? Let's be a team... Again. Watch out! Wait, easy... You could've caught me before I fell. I don't think it's broken, you're overacting. - You have to watch him perform! - I'm not talking to you. How do you know it's not broken? Perhaps you've graduated from a medical university? I am a coach, I've seen all kinds of traumas. A girlfriend of mine was a nurse. You're absolutely right. So when you stuck your flash drive into her port, you caught all her medical knowledge like an STD? Won't you say something as well? Perhaps your uncle is a vet? - So we're taking him to the hospital? - We have to. Finally something clever. I've been underestimating you. Or maybe not. Those two are morons. Enough! We have a more urgent issue. Our preparation is not going well. - You don't say! - Well? - Do you have something in mind? - I have bad news for you. It sounds weird but... We will have to live together. - Together? - Pardon? Just like a sports camp, getting up, eating and practicing together. - Sure, I'm staying with my folks. - And I'm staying at a hotel. - What about me? - It's decided, let's go. - But I can't tell my... - Stop blabbing and keep walking! Take him to the hospital, get your luggage and come to my place. - Unlock the car. - So we'll be living together? And we'll be practicing together. Just like Alex said. - Wait! Careful, please. - Easy. - My career will be over. - What career? Careful with my head. Easy with that leg. - Watch out with my anklie. - So how old are you, little Achko? Do not spoil my good impression of you, Deyan... Moron! Watch your step, shmuck! Yes, you guessed right, it's me. Satisfied now? - Sorry, are you talking to me? - Just say it, you want an autograph! Don't you see that I'm in pain? - Sorry, do we know each other? - Yeah, right. Good afternoon. Next, please. Acho? Kathy? Mom? What's going on? Sorry for interrupting, but it's been quite a long pause. Your mother and I... Obviously, you know each other. Spare me the details. No, it's not that. - Isn't it? - The kid is here. - That's exactly why I asked. - I won't tell how your mother and I... - Acho! - You know. - Why are you here? - I sprained my ankle. - But I'm fine. - Let me take a look. - Please, come in. - Are you sure? - I feel a little pain, but it's okay. - Come on! Kathy... Excuse me. So you finally introduced them to one another. He is a spitting image of him. And... Continue, kids. The same mistake. I told you a hundred times! Again. You can't be that stupid! - Sorry, but your foot... - Is at its exact place! You can't remember a single thing, you stupid! - Don't talk to me like that. - Then stop fooling around! - She asked you something. - What? You'd better listen to her. Stop interfering, moron! Sorry, but can't you see the kimono and what I teach? What I see is a bullhead... wearing pyjamas. So I'm telling you... Calm down. It's not broken. I'll smash you! Now you'll have to wait for your headache to pass off. - Do you like it? - Well... Do you want it? - It was his grandfather's room. - Exactly. If I have a girl over it'd be a little awkward... - You know. - It might not be that bad. Those springs haven't creaked for quite some time. Have some respect! I just don't understand why would you have girls over. After all, you are married. I'm getting divorced. I have to catch up. And yet, you are still not a divorcee. Technically. But you're a friend and you'll give the room over to me. I gave Laura over to you, but you did nothing. I gave Laura over to you. She was in love with me. I gave her over to you and you didn't even have sex with her. Hey, shmucks! Wait! I was so dumbfounded that I didn't even thank you. Maybe you don't have to. I might have left you without a dancing partner. We seem to be heading in one direction. I'm not following you or something. Sorry to hear that. - What do we do now? - About what? When a man beats another man because of a woman, it means he's ready to take his place. - I didn't know that. - I'm left without a dancing partner. And perhaps you are not a karate coach anymore, so... Now you have to tell me your name. Alex. I don't know why I wavered. Alex, short for Alexander of course. I knew it. And now if you say that you are a Sagittarius... Almost. Libra. My favorite sign. I just didn't have the courage to guess it first. So what do we do now, Alex, short for Alexander? Well, I... And what's your name? Dara. Short for Dara. In fact I'm a really good dancer. But... I just don't like it. Sorry. - I don't understand one thing... - I'm listening. How come it didn't even occur to you to help me with my bag? I don't want you to think that I'm hitting on you. Sorry to hear that. He was huge! Taller even than me! I'm too young to have such an old son. - So she's been hiding him from you? - I have no idea. I just ran. - Are you serious? - My leg healed that instant. They are blackmailing me, because I'm famous now. - But you met them by accident. - So what? Then you theory of blackmail is totally unsubstantiated. Is it even possible for me to have become a... Acho! Welcome to the club. I hope it won't reach the media. Why don't you start hitting on me? This bag is so heavy. - Gladly, but I'm turning right. - Great. So am I. - Girl... - It's Dara. Dara. Sorry. Do you think that if you continue like this, you'll get off easily? - Could you be more specific? - Yes, I could. I don't want to hear you backing down and saying you were just joking. - Is that a threat? - It's a promise. I am headed to 25 Hristo Stanchev st. It's up to you what you can promise me until we get there. I am headed to 25 Hristo Stanchev st. In fact I live there. Hey, shmucks! I know it's lame, but I think I fell in love with my cousin. Are you sure about the address? Alex... Alexander Vassilev? Yes, it's Vassilev. How do you know? Shit. She's in town for a contest and was to stay with her Granny Radka. Granny Radka has a new boyfriend and sent her to the house of her long diseased sister Kalina. Granny Radka is his Granny's sister. Yes, Granny Kalina is my grandmother. Alex. She is just a second cousin of yours. My uncle married his second cousin. They have a son and he is totally normal. So what are you exactly saying? They might not go to such extremes, but at least he can shag her. You're such a pervert. - And where is she now? - She's on the porch outside. And I just got to know that... ...I have an 18-year-old son. But your drama is much bigger, obviously. Judging by your faces, Alex has told you everything. That's right. Shall I help you with your luggage? You'd better not. It is there... to the right. You'd better watch out or you might get quite a surprise. Imagine if she wasn't his cousin. Welcome to ANIMA. I am Petya Stoycheva Krivitsky. The first session of training in peace is about learning how to be here and now. Is Vicky in the bathroom? And I have to admit that his voice... - Going to a black party? - I don't have other clean clothes. - Anything interesting? - Not with the two of us. But I wouldn't say the same for the left and right side of the yard. If you think about it, your thoughts are often in the past or in the future. It looks like a pending incest to me. Your mother and I weren't too careful and so, bang-bang, you came to this world. - It's not your fault or something. - It's a total disaster. So what are the two of us going to do? - What do you mean? - I mean, about Laura. Don't you want to know what's happened to her? I'd rather not see her or I might start stuttering again. DAY 1 OF THE MARATHON Guys, I'm out. - Deyan, don't. - Why not? We knew this would happen. We made fools of ourselves. - He wants us to fall out. - And he's done it. I'm not going through this again. Pull yourselves together, guys. Deyan, what are you doing? Deyan, wait. Isn't that your cousin? Yes, it's him. I didn't think you were able to hold a grudge. I'm not holding a grudge. I just have a perfect memory. Then how do you explain that? Midlife crisis. I fell in love with your kindness. I don't think those guys pose any threat to you. You must have fallen in love with the wrong person. Deyan! You just can't be the first traitor. Logic shows this had to be me. Just wait, please. Deyan, stop! Don't make me shout. - What's going on? - I see things as they are. It's just your point of view. We all admired you and wished to be like you. You're the only one with a family, a great job and a big salary. All my life I've been doing the right thing and now I see my son twice a month and pay alimony to my wife. And now I have to help my friends I haven't seen for ages. Why? Because it's right. And now I'm being mocked by some pseudo... I am sorry, but it's time for me to think of myself. Okay? I found Laura. No profile picture. She has an arts school nearby. - So? - I left a message. - We are to meet. - What did you write to her? I wrote anonymously that I want her to teach my wonderful kids. What kids? And why anonymously? So that we go to the meeting place and if she's become fat and grown some beard and moustache, then we'll just skedaddle. Otherwise we stay. This is the most biased statement I've ever heard, but it sounds like a plan. Come on! Let's go. - It fell into the water... - I've been looking for you all day! You found me. - Is it insured? - Yes. - Why are you behaving like that? - Like what? One moment, please. - I have to tell you something. -I'm listening. - I see you don't want us to talk. - Your ID, please. - No. - Unbelievable! Wait! Here you are. Don't you have peripheral vision? I wasn't talking to you. What's the urgency, Dara? - It's not the right time, obviously. - Wait. - I'll be right back. - Fine. Now. Let's start over. I am listening to you. You lost today, fine. But why are you blaming me? - I don't know who's blaming whom. - I know about the house. This should be an incentive. You had more personality when we met. Don't talk to me like that in front of other people. Why not? What will you do, cousin? Make another promise to me? Excuse me. This is your temp phone until yours is being repaired. Relatives. Thank you. What's up, dude? Wait. Listen to me. - We didn't start off too well. - Because you ran like hell. - Just like you did 18 years ago. - Wait a minute, that's not true. It's okay. My name is Angel. - May I go now? - I am Angel, too. But they call you Acho and that's lame. Wait. Let's go and have a drink, I mean soda. You're a bit late for that fatherly nonsense. - What can I do when your Mom... - Acho! This time I'll leave you two have a quiet moment alone. Do you have something to tell me? When were you going to tell me? There has to be a law obliging women to tell men when they become fathers. - This is a total crime to me. - I really tried. Several times. When I knew I was pregnant you were so excited about leaving to study acting. You kept talking all night and I fell asleep in the end. A week later I came to Sofia to tell you personally. I waited for you in front of the Academy and finally... I saw you kissing a girl. I was a kid then. - I don't even remember this. - It's true. I think my situation would've made you unhappy. And I don't think that the situation now is any different. - What if she's fat now? - That's why we're hiding. Well, yes, if she's fat now, we'll see her from afar. It's even worse than that. It's unbelievable. Oh man, she's so pregnant. This one is Laura. - You can't be sure. - She looks like her. She looks like the grownup sexy version of Laura from my fantasies. Maybe you should go and check before she's left. - That's right, smartasses. - Come on, let's go. You go first. What are those morons doing? - Waiting for her to talk to them. - Maybe she's forgotten them. With this body of hers, she's forgotten them alright. Act casual. Alex. Would you tell those two to stop acting like dimwits? And tell me why they called me. -Hello, Laurie. - Hello. - Laura. - We found her! Are you two serious? You show up 20 years later expecting something to happen. At once. - No one said it has to be at once. - He didn't mean that. - That sounded a bit weird. - Right. We can talk straight to each other. We're grownups now. What? I have an idea. We can make up a schedule. - A what? - A schedule. You can take the weekends and you, the workdays. Or vice versa. - Suit yourself. I am fine with that. - Pardon? My weekends are busy. I have domestic flights that can't be rescheduled. You can take him from Monday to Friday or we can take turns every two days. What? She's fooling around with us. I know so well she's joking! Why are you laughing at me? What about your weekends? Sorry about earlier. What? Did you say something? - I am sorry I behaved like a... - I can't hear you! - Could you repeat that louder? - Dara! Why have you come back? You cannot fail more than that, hopefully. So let's hear it. Branimir wants to take Alex's house. So we... We grew up in there, so we can't... You grew up in there, too. So many memories have come to us. It's not that we wanted something specific. - And we were hiding because... - I know too well why you were hiding. You wanted to see if I wasn't fat, bearded, having six children and all that mess. She hasn't changed a bit. She's that same old idiot. We were not discussing you. We were just talking about important stuff. DAY 2 OF THE MARATHON Don't you wait for us, Vicky! - What's going on? - Nothing's going on. I was so eager at the start, but now I'm wearing out. - Then say 'I will win'. Come on. - Why? - I will win. - Again. - I will win. - Louder! - Shout it out! - I will win! - Who's gonna win? - I will win! - Who's gonna win? - I will win! Come on! Come on! - Son! - Excuse me for a moment. Today, we won... Well, almost won the marathon. - But not thanks to you. - It doesn't matter. What matters is we're together now. And we can... How shall I put it? - We can hit on bimbos. - Are you serious? Just don't tell them that I'm your father. - Carrie, hello. - Hi. - I'll be over there. - I'll join you in a minute. Okay. While I'm just talking, you are taking action. Hello. Hello there. Sorry for interrupting, but I have an important announcement. The song was too boring anyway. Hello, boys and girls! My name is Acho. But I'm sure you all know me well. Whatever. What's more important, our team won today and I'd like to invite to the stage our hero Victor who is going to sing us a song. He's a bit embarrassed, but he sings like an angel in the shower. Just don't ask me how do I know that. Let's hear it for Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! - I'll kill you! - Just listen... I need a favor... Okay? I'll kill you. Hello and good evening. Go, Vicky! It's a bit high for you, isn't it? And now I'd like to invite here a young and very talented musician. His name is Angel Karayanev. Let's invite him to the stage and perform together. Let's hear it for Angel! He's so good, isn't he? - Yes, he is! - I am his father. I know, I'm too young to have such a big son... - Sorry, I'd like to listen to him. - Yes, sure. Come on! Cheers! - Cheers to you! - Well done, Vicky! Now, before we all get wasted, please explain to me what's going on? There's a party going on which you are trying to spoil. Okay, but why would Branimir do these things to you? - I'd like to know that, too. - I'll tell you. Branko was a nerd. And he'd always wanted to be in our group. He wanted to be a part of it. - But we felt that... - That he's not a good person. And now he proved it. I remember that, but how did he manage to take the house? My grandfather knew he was dying and he wanted to sign the house over to someone. I didn't understand how Branko managed to convince him about it. But he did. That's bad. Are you sure you don't want to sit here? - So you knew just now? - Yes. When you see your father for the first time in 18 years you expect him to be more serious. I was at an audition recently and I had to act like a bird. What is it that you don't like about him? He's such a funny pterodactyl. They said, 'don't lift your leg so much', and I was like... - He's a pterodactyl, not a father. - Oh, come on. You didn't know your father and I haven't seen my mother for quite some time. So... - I am sorry. - Don't be. Are you doing it on purpose? Doing what? - This song. - What about it? You used to sing it to me under my balcony while you were still romantic. It wasn't this song. Oh, yes. It was a long time ago, but women remember those things forever. What else do women remember? I remember how one day I decided to get down only to see you gone with your friends. If only... What? If only... But now we'll never know. Alex! Is that you? And posing with this. Do you know they called me Fatty? You are so funny, all of you. This is in front of the house. - This is Granny. - And this is my Granny. - This is my Granny Radka. - Yes, and Granny Kalina. - Are those the two sisters? - Yes. There's no resemblance. It's because my Granny was adopted. Her parents died... - I am so stupid. - You are. - Are you sure about this? - I don't know. I was a kid when she told me, I can't be sure about it. - I'll ask my Granny. - Let me call her. - You have Granny Radka's number? - Yes, I do. Just a moment. - After all, she's my Granny's sister. - Or maybe she isn't. See? Is this her phone number? Loudspeaker. Fun call. Your Granny has a fun call and isn't picking up. - Well... - Let's go then. - She's probably sleeping. -So what? Come on! Would you like us to go in and take a look around the house? Because you suddenly became interested in interior design? No. I really wanted to take a look around the house. That was to take away the tension of making the first step. That was cool. Okay, let's go and take a look. But nothing more. - Okay. - Fine. So you're an arts teacher now? And you're a banker? That's great. Ever since you were little you've showed... an aptitude for painting. So sfumato was a technique for painting air, wasn't it? Like... haziness. - Deyan? - Yes? Do you remember it? This was... - This was from fifth grade. - Sixth grade. Whatever. It was after our exam. My handwriting is still that ugly. Even then you showed propensity for numbers. I didn't draw the heart. No. It wasn't you who drew it. Let's join the others. Granny Radka! Are you out of your mind? Get a smaller one! Granny Radka! - It's me, Dara. - Oh, Dara! - And who's that shmuck with you? - My cousin Alex. - Cousin. - That's what we'd like to find out. Is it true that Granny Kalina was adopted by your parents? So you moron woke me up in the middle of the night to ask me this? That Granny Kalina... We haven't spoken for twenty years or so. Your Grandpa was so in love with me but that slut took him away from me! Granny! Get to the point! Were you real sisters? We were sisters! Just not by blood. Her parents had died of an illness. And my parents took pity on her and took in that pain in the ass! - So Dara and I aren't... - Come on, take her. You may both try out the strength of your bed-springs and let me have some sleep! He is my favorite singer, in fact. I really hope they aren't cousins. Acho The Second! Daddy's boy! - Shit. It's my father. - What? I am too late and he's coming to take me home. They are coming. Quick! Pretend nothing's happened. - How do we do that? - Just be spontaneous. Let me show you some wedding pictures. This one here is... It was really nice but my father is coming to take me. - But you're not a kid anymore. - Don't worry. - I've put clean bed sheets. - You can stay over. It's okay to stay here... Dad... Go. - Dad, I... - Go. But I was just... Well done, my boy! Just one more step. Drinking doesn't help. We've got three days only. Excuse us for being here to help you. Do you think we just came to jog around the amphitheatre? Calm down, I understand. Fine, that's enough for today. I'm working on it. - Is everything okay? - Sort of. How about you? Sort of. Well, there is something. My dancing partner Kiril, whom you beat up... - He let you down. We expected it. - But my contest is in four days. I am sorry. Is there anything I can do? In fact there is. No. Come on! I'll do the dancing and you'll support me. No. But you have such a good co-ordination! Why don't you get another dancing partner? Because only you and I can convey that passion into dance. I have to train for the finals in three days. - It'll be just several hours a day. - What? But I have to train my friends, too. - So you don't have time for me. - I have physical limits, that's all. But you don't have limits for other things. You are trying to manipulate me. It's the house we are fighting for. - The house is not just yours. - What? I have a brother and sister to look after. - I could start a dancing school. - Tell me about the house. - I could use those money. - The house. You care only for that house! Have you asked me what I want? - Good luck with the marathon. - Dara, wait. Where are you going? Dara! So you were passing by my house just accidentally? How come? I went out just to clear my head from the marathon and... And then I saw you. Maybe it's the Law of Attraction. The Law of Attraction... This is starting to look ridiculous. If you want to tell me something or do something... ...just be direct. We're not fifteen anymore. Well, then... Wait, wait... I was joking. Or maybe I wasn't joking, I don't know. Or maybe it was a joke with a grain of truth in it. I messed up... Could you drop me off over there? - Hi. - Hi. How are you? I'm doing fine. Could you stop looking at me like this? Like what? You make me feel nervous and I'm lost for words. Good morning, Miss! Okay. I know I'm interrupting a business meeting, but family scandals cannot be delayed. Please, excuse me. Why have you grounded Carina from school? Because she's hooked up with the son of my nemesis. What age do you live in? Nobody uses that word anymore. He's one of my worst enemies. Other questions? - You must be crazy to keep her here. - It's just for three days. You are involving Carina in that obsession of yours. - It's my fight. Stay out of it. - Fight... This must be another word from that same era. You live in the past, you know? - Stay out, it's none of your business. - You know what? I'm taking your daughter to school and if you try to stop me, I'll make the biggest scene this glass office has ever seen! Has something happened? Mom was right, you're only using people. And those are the words of a person who used me as a donor. Okay, I take it back. Just think your words over in the present situation. Unless you're interested in the sexual position that got to you. You got close to me just because Carina is the daughter of that guy. I had no idea whose daughter she was. You saw it yourself. My relations with Branimir have nothing to do with you or Carina. Carina is a fine girl. Don't treat her... The way you treated my Mom? Vicky? You're stuttering again. Is that what you came to tell me? I stutter only when I see you. Or at least I did before. You know what... I was thinking that... If nothing happened then, maybe it just wasn't supposed to. Maybe. I don't want you to leave. Neither do I. I overreacted a little. It's good that you came to stop me. Or you would leave just because you're so stubborn, right? - Thank you. - Not at all. In fact I could help you with those dances. It's okay, I know you're too busy. - Who is it? - Unknown number. Who is it now? - Don't go. - I'll be right back. Sorry for barging in like this. But, technically, the house is mine. You must be wondering why I'm here. I am looking for Dara. Here she is. Now maybe you're wandering what do I have to do with her. I brought her money. This is the moment for my favorite line: It's not what you think it is. In fact, Alex... It's exactly what you're thinking. I'm paying her. For? To love you, Alex. I'm paying her to love you. Money can do so many things. Women have always loved money in an envelope. And now, as I feel the situation has gotten too intense, I will leave you two so that you feel its weight. Alex... You said you were leaving. - You may go now. - Listen to me. Go! I know that. I just need... Can you put Matthew on the phone for two seconds, please? He will catch his... Guys, we just have to rank third and the house will be ours. This means we must not rank last. Are you crazy? Why are you here? I know. I'm sorry. I just needed to see you. - Someone might see us. - No one would see us there. Is that Mom? No, it's not your Mom. Go inside. What's going on? Alex, what are you doing? Alex, what's going on? What's the matter, man? What's the matter with you? Alex? Wait, don't. I still don't know why I'm here. What's happened to you? I fell while I was running. Because of me? - Yes, because of you. - But you don't know why you're here. It's not that simple. I'm still mad at you. So you rushed and battered yourself just to tell me that? It was impulsive, I admit. - Are you waiting for me to speak? - You betrayed me from the start! - I tried to tell you. - It was awful. If it wasn't for you, I would not have realized that I betrayed him. I have to thank you for that, but I can't because I'm so mad at you! - I don't understand a single word. - I know. But you have to get on the train and there's no time to explain. Aren't you here to stop me from leaving? No, you have to live with the consequences of what you did. But we could get together in a few years. So you're sending me into exile or what? Get on the train. Now you know what you're missing. - You fuck! - Traitor. - Moron. - Bitch. You won't hold on even for a few months, let alone a few years. All this just to pay him back. You're still suffering because of her. - I'm suffering because of him. - Why does it matter who it was? It could be anyone else, just not him. I'd be grateful. He is the reason we met. I can't be grateful for Carina not seeing her mother for ten years. Or because you haven't seen your ex for ten years. - Why would I be interested in her? - Your past interferes with our present. - He needs to realize what he's done. - The problem is that we all did. I hope you're happy now. Come on, Carrie, let's go. I knew you'd be here. You're all leaving, aren't you? Twenty years ago... It was more than twenty years ago. You were all leaving again and I was sitting right here. Everything's changed since then. But now I know what I want. It's just that I don't. I've started having doubts lately. Doubts give rise to fears. And fears prevent us from believing. Could you step back, please? Stop staring and get in the car. There you are! How was your little walk? Don't explain, just get in the car, your suitcase is already in here. Wait! I can explain everything! We are staying at the hotel. Don't call! Don't come! Do you remember when we were young and were leaving? We were to meet Laura and say goodbye. What happened then? I just didn't go so that you could go to her. It's not because of the house. What? We didn't come back because of the house. - Then why did we come back? - Just think. We came back for our own sake. - Wait. - What's going on? - It's not because of the house. - We haven't arranged that, I swear. I lied about Branimir. He is right to do that to me. I mislead you about him. And I don't deserve your help. I am sorry. That's all I wanted to say. I'm sorry. - Alex, wait. - Is that all? Yes, you were foolish and selfish. And we also participated for selfish reasons. We were going to come back and make it look dramatic. We were just looking for a spot to make a U-turn. But... Come with me. Forget it. She told you not to come. Daddy... - I know. - Why are you such an asshole? - Did you tell him not to come? - Yes. - Did you tell him he's an asshole? - I did. Dad, I've always looked up to you, but... - Your childish behavior makes it hard. - I know. - You're too young to understand. - That night, I was there, too. Is he still here? Angel and I haven't done anything. For now. - There. You failed again. - What have I done? Women always test you, you need to know that. - Have I told you not to come? - Yes, you have. You shouted it and wrote it and Carina told it to me, too. - Enough with that circus! - Shut up, both of you! If you didn't want to see him, we wouldn't be in his partner's hotel. You should tell her why you're doing this. And I don't want to hear about it! Yana, please. - You want to talk to Matthew? - No, I wanna talk to you. Don't know where to start. When I came back here I thought that all of a sudden I'm gonna be really happy. And it's true, I am having fun, but it's nothing compare to what I have with you and Matthew. And I know that I've said that I don't feel at home in London, but maybe... maybe home is a person, maybe home is where your family is, maybe home is where you guys are. I... I just... I just want you to come home, baby. - Why are you here? - And why are you here? Do you remember how on this very bench... ...we ate bread with mayonnaise? Of course I remember. - I put on three kilos because of that! - You still haven't lost them. Do you remember how you made me throw away all my ex boyfriends' pictures? And then I made you fish them out of the bin to prove it to me. Even more, you made me get into that bin! You psycho! You know... The last time I saw you, it was on this very bench. I was just thinking about it, too. I hope you are not dating someone? I could easily get rid of him. Or maybe I could get rid of him. I'll be right back. Laura. I realized something very important about myself that I have to tell you. I realized that I've been looking for happiness all around the world never to find it. Ever. And... Now that I'm leaving again, I realize that I might never find it. And if I leave, I will stray away from it. Maybe I shouldn't have left at all or should have left earlier. After what I've heard? - I see two options before us. - Okay. The first is accepting the facts the way they are because it was just not meant to be. And the second one is that... Maybe it's high time that we started altering our fate. It's up to you. Take your seats, quick! Excuse me. Sorry. It's a sign. No way. Laura. The truth is I'm glad you came. I know. This still doesn't solve our problems. Then we have to find a way to solve them. It's all up to you. You have to forgive. Forgive? Has anybody asked for my forgiveness? There's no need. Just do it for your own sake. - What have I done? - Don't you realize? - You live in your past. - Is that so? What have I got? I followed the rules and in the end I got hurt, not him. I don't even know why you came. I think I know what the problem is. Your ego is more important than your Granddad's memory. Fill it up with Extra force. Good evening, Mr. Vassilev. - Hello, Danny. - How are you today? Having a bad day. Second gas pump. I understand. Mr. Vassilev. I read the book you recommended to me. You were right. Victor Frankl said it very well. The pain stops being one the moment you find its meaning. But you probably already know it. Have a nice evening. Grandpa. So you've come to get your stuff? No, I came to see you. You should've brought Carina. I've seen you quite enough. Next time. But I guess she won't be glad to see your cousin again. - So you know that Alex... - Yes. He shagged your wife. I don't know what's happened to him. Had I been younger, I would have beaten him up. Let's not talk about it, Grandpa. Come sit for a while. There are people coming here all the time offering to build an apartment house, a hotel and whatnot. I chase them away, swearing and throwing rocks at them. But your cousin talks to them, bargaining, I see him. I planted this walnut tree. I did everything with these two hands. This is my life here. If the house is gone, it would be as if I haven't lived at all. You will live in our hearts, Grandpa. Stop that sentimental nonsense. You'll kick the bucket, too, one day. But the walnut tree will be still here. The stones will be here, too. Do you see this bush here? I mean that one. This is where I shagged your Grandma, and she conceived your Mom. Stop it. - This is a copy of my will. - No, Grandpa... He is a home wrecker. I don't trust him. I want you to promise me that I can rely on you. - Grandpa, I... - Branimir! The world continues after our petty lives are over. So we'd better leave something behind us. Something more than just a picture. Do you understand? I haven't much time left. That's why I want you to promise me that all this is going to live. This house, the yard, the fountain... All of this. Only then will I feel easy that I haven't lived in vain, my dear boy. Alright, Grandpa. That's my boy. A few months... OR ...a few years later... Let's hear you now!
