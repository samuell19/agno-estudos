- Then I heard was sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peels of thunder shouting, "Hallelujah, for our Lord God Almighty reigns." Tommy, please pick it up at verse 7. - Let us rejoice and be glad and give Him glory for the wedding of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready. Go on. - Fine linen bright and clean was given to her to wear. Then the angel said to me, "Right, blessed are those "who are invited to the wedding supper of the lamb." He added, "These are the true words of God." - You could stop there Tommy, thanks. Dennis, what do you think he means? - He means that we are the bride. Jesus is telling us that he is our bride groom. - It isn't Jesus talking; it's John. - The word of God? - You're both right. Yes Dennis, John's doin' the talking but we can never forget this is the word of God. A man might be writing the text, but only as a vessel to God. Christ speaks through the words. What he's saying here is we are the bride of Christ, the wedding is Heaven and we must remain pure for Him. Do you want to come to your wedding day and disappoint Him? No, we wanna remain clean and righteous in the eyes of God. - Can we get to the good stuff? - What would that be, Tommy? - Couple paragraphs down. Jesus kills the Beast, birds start eating people, blood and guts everywhere. - Let's pick up where we left off next week. I know most of you guys would be too busy in your daily lives to read the good stuff. But please read Revelation in your devotion time, so we can talk about it more next week. Let's pray, guys. - I've been dyin' to kiss you all day. - It's all I could think about. We'll be alone this weekend. I can't wait. We should go in. Worship's about to start. - One more. - Dennis, could I steal you away for a second? - The service is startin'. - Just for a second, if I can keep you two apart for that long. - It's okay, I'll find us a spot. - You have the dreams, don't you? I had them too when I was your age. Sometimes they still come back. The end of everything we know, the coming of Christ, others only read about it. We can see them. They always came to me at times of great temptation. I hear you and Kate aren't goin' home after the retreat. Don't look so surprised, Dennis. Jessica's discipleship leader and my wife keeps no secrets from me. - We're goin' up north for a week. - Alone? Yes. - Do you think that's a good idea? - We asked Charlie and Annette to go, but they can't this weekend. - I'll ask you again, Dennis. Do you think it's a good idea for you and Kate to go up there alone? - My parents don't have any problem with it. - I spoke to your mom and dad about it this morning. They're not excited about you goin' up there without a chaperone. - We're not children. - Dennis, you and I both know Kate's mom's not a believer. She hasn't had a man of God in her life in a long time. You, Dennis, you're her rock. - I know. - Are you two struggling with lust? - No. You don't trust me. - Dennis, I'm talkin' to you right now 'cause I do trust you and I want the best for you and Kate. Jessica and I both do. We know how difficult of a time this is. This has gotta be the hardest time to stay pure. Your wedding's only a few months away. It's easy to say we love each other, we're gonna get married, so why wait? Right? Right? - We're goin' camping, that's all. - I didn't tell you not to go, but I want you to be careful. - I promise we won't do anything. I'll be careful. - Don't be afraid of them.

And you two don't see any real ones? - Breaking - one of two convicts who escaped from the Maricopa County Prison has been found. He was surrounded in an abandoned home in the town of Buckeye and is now in custody. Police are still looking for the second convict. - 23.47. - Kate, go out and wait in the truck. I'll be there in a minute. - Okay. - 23.47. - It's wonderful, isn't it? - Yes, it's beautiful. - You haven't seen nothin' yet. C'mon. - Shouldn't we unpack first? - That can wait. C'mon, silly. It's freezing. Hurry up, slowpoke! Mom and dad used to take us here when we were kids. Haven't really been here since. You won't believe what you're about to see. Is this? Hey, Kate! What is this? - Where we go in. - Kate, we can't do that. - Dennis, I've been here before. - Like 10 or 12 years ago. - I actually never went inside. - See? You don't know what's livin' in there. - Come on, what are you so scared of, a big, scary beast? Hey you, Mr Mountain Lion, we're coming in. Hope you don't mind a little company. See? Nothing to be afraid of. It's just kinda cold. It's beautiful here. - You're beautiful. What's that? - Oh, it leads down to some older tunnels. A kid fell down there in the 70s and got stuck or at least that's what the Park Rangers told us when they told us not to come in here. Can we go? - Down there? - No, back to the truck. - What if we stayed here tonight? - You're joking, right? Two minutes ago, you didn't even wanna come in here. Now you wanna stay? - I don't know. When's the last time you got the chance to camp out in a cave? - Never? Lord willing, I'll never have to. Hey, come take a nap with me. - Let's go for a hike. - No Dennis, we just went for a hike. A swim? That waterfall was pretty. - No, my toes are still freezing from the first time they touched the water. Why don't we just lay down for a little bit, then we'll collect some wood and build a fire? - I'm not tired. I think I'll just read some more. - Alright, wake me up in an hour please. I don't wanna miss our weekend. - Alright. - Hey, I love you. - Love you, too. - You know you're on my land, don't you? - My girlfriend brought us up here. - It's okay, kids come up here. Been comin' up here for years. I don't mind much. As long as it ain't the kind that smokes whatever it is you all got these days; set my trees on fire. I don't take too kindly to them. - I don't smoke anything, sir. - Just up here for a little roll in the hay. - No sir, we're not married yet. - Right. You're not a Christian. Puritan, that's what you are. Puritans. They're afraid of the woods. They think there's evil in the forest. I happen to think it's the only place where there ain't evil, just nature. You deaf? Here. You can tell her you caught it. - With what? She won't believe me. - Boy, they'll believe anything if you say it right. - What's your name? - John. - I'm Dennis. - Hey, I've been looking for you. - Who are they? Aw, shit! - What'd you do, bro? - Dammit, stepped in shit. Hey, what's up man? C'mon, what do ya got right there? - Why are you goin' fishin' when you got a big piece of tuna right here, man? - Hey relax, man. We're just keepin' your Mrs safe. - From the lions. - Lions? - Cougars. Cruises. - You don't mind if we hang around for a little while, do you? - Yeah, we do. We are planning on it being just us and there's plenty of room out here for you guys to go elsewhere. - That ain't very social. - Well this is our trip. Trip. That's what we were plannin' to do. Check this out, we got extra. If you guys wanna stick around, you don't have to of course. - You guys must know John. Yup, he told me there were some guys hangin' out here on his land. I just spoke to him down at the creek. - You're right, there's plenty of room around here. Lions, tigers and bears! Oh my! - How did you come up with that? - With what? - The John or Jim thing. - I guess I just have an active imagination. - You know that's called lying. But it's like a white lie to protect me. Fiji. I can't wait. Aren't you excited? - Yeah. - Well you don't sound like it. - I am. I want it to be now. - What's wrong? Do you not want me to touch you? - I think if we let ourselves go too far, we might not be able to stop. - Okay. What if I don't want to stop? - Kate, we're gonna be married in a few months. - Exactly, so what does it matter? Dennis, I love you and you love me and we're getting married. What does it matter if we just do it now? - You know it's wrong. Look Kate, I love you. I do really wanna be with you. - No, yeah, you're right. - Greg warned me this would happen. Yeah. Jessica told me to be careful. It's none of their fucking business anyway. - Kate, don't say that. - Dennis, it's just us out here. There's no one watching us, looking over our shoulder. No one counting up our sins. - You know that's not true. He's watching. Kate. - No, please leave me alone. Dennis, where are you going? Dennis? Dennis, don't leave me! Why did you leave me like that? - I thought I heard something. - What did you hear? - Footsteps. - Dennis, stop that. What? - You're trying to scare me. - Kate, I heard footsteps. - Right, well I don't believe you. Do you think they came back? - Maybe it was the fisherman. - Fisherman? Nothin'. - Dennis, what's going on? Okay, you can sleep in the truck. Kate. Goodnight. - You almost let it die. Just went down to the creek to wash up. I feel better now. Ya know what a shiv is? - No. - This little thing. Now it woulda come in mighty handy in prison, lemme tell ya. Any pointed object, really. Anything you get your hands on, gold. Of course, don't mean nothin' out here. That your girlfriend? - She's my fiancee. - Ssh, you don't wanna wake her. Engaged, huh? You got really good taste in women, really good taste. - John's comin' by any minute now. He owns this place. - Oh does he now? Well then I guess you better start makin' him some breakfast. Maybe some coffee and when he gets here, it's a little cold. - The coffee's in the truck. - Yeah. - Dennis? - You listen to this stuff? I love Schumann. Incredible pianist 'til he broke his hand, of course. A lotta time inside and had a pretty extensive library. Speakin' of hand injuries, didn't some guy hack his own arm off with one of these? Jesus. - We don't have any money with us, but you can take the truck. - Just leave us alone. What, leave you two out here in the middle of nowhere? - You could drop us off back in town. Back in town, huh? Police still have not found the second escaped convict identified as Bob Berenger, who is serving a 15 year sentence for grand theft auto and assault. The prisoner he escaped with, Amos Balsam, was found last week on the outskirts of Tucson. Berenger's believed to have traveled north while Balsam went south. Please contact authorities if you have heard any information on the convicts whereabouts. - I told Amos to come with me, but he wanted to go to Mexico. Too bad. - What are you gonna do with us? - With you? Nothin'. With her? It's been a long time, a really long time. I got what I could inside but it ain't the same, I'm tellin' you. There's no substitute. - Dennis? - Don't you dare touch her. - I've been dreamin' a goddamn long while 'bout touchin' a girl like her. Heck, anything without two balls dangling between its legs. So yeah, I'm gonna touch her. I am gonna fuck you. You can lie there and take it and make it a terrible experience. Not for me, but for yourself. I plan on enjoying it no matter what. You could enjoy it too, if you want. I'd like that. Dennis over here almost let the fire go out last night. Why don't you come over here and warm up? For breakfast! - You're just gonna kill us here, aren't you? - Kill you? No, I'm not gonna kill you. Probably take your suggestion; leave you two out here. Drive the truck up to Colorado. Have you ever been to Trinidad? Used to be a mining town back in the day. Nice little place. Take your bra off. - What? - Take your bra off. I wanna see your breasts. Does this make it a little easier? - C'mon! - Dennis, stop! - What? - Where are we going? - Be quiet, he'll be coming any minute. - Outside. - Where? - Follow me! Do you think he's gone? - I don't know. - What happens when it gets dark? He probably just took the truck and left, like he said he would. We should check. - What? - Let's go see if he's out there. - Kate, no. - Dennis, we have no food here, no water. It'll be dark soon. - Okay, I'll go check. - Hey, hey. I love you. - Welcome back to the land of the living, Dennis. I told you earlier; I didn't have no plans to kill you. But what you did wasn't very nice. You won't be goin' anywhere anytime soon. - What'd you do to her? - Nothing yet. You tried to stab me with this. This big ol' rusted nail. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were tryin' to kill me, Dennis. Were you tryin' to kill me, Dennis? I asked you a question. Yes. - You're very lucky I'm the forgivin' type. Because I ain't gonna kill ya. But I'm still not gonna take any chances, buddy. You done? Will you shut up? He's the one in pain, not you. Take your bra off. Now! Don't be shy. Take your panties off. Don't make me ask twice. - Please. - What did I say? - I'm a virgin. - What? Buddy, does your dick work or what? - We're waiting. - Waiting. For what, the second comin' of Christ? - Marriage. We're Christians. - Dennis, you're tellin' me you got this piece of ass over here and you never tried to nail it? That's crazy. You're crazy. How old are you, Kate? Yeah. That is the last time I ask a question and you don't answer it. - 22. - What a waste. I'm sorry, honey. That it had to be me for your first time. You can make this hard on yourself or you can try and enjoy it. Yeah, I knew you'd come around. Stop it. - Honey, what's wrong? - Where is he? Kate, where is he? - I don't know. - It's okay, I still love you. - You guys got some nifty toys. Looks like you come prepared. - I'm cold. - Yeah, women are always cold. - Can you start a fire? - In this place? Sure, if you wanna choke on a bunch of smoke. Dennis, sure you wanna marry this girl? She ain't exactly the sharpest nail in the toolbox. C'mon, I know you're thirsty. It's from the creek. It's not like I pissed in it or anything. - I'm thirsty. - How's the hand? You're probably gonna need a tetanus shot. Can tell ya that much. Here, put this on for Christ's sake. In case of an emergency, ya never know. Damn, I almost forgot about those things. Menace to society. Where's yours? Don't do that again. I said don't do that again. Now what in the hell did you intend to do with these? Men, always thinkin' with their dicks. Don't worry honey, he won't need these. Whistle. I'm tryin' to figure out how I can leave you two up here in this cave. Someone might be able to find you easy after I take off. Maybe a trail of breadcrumbs. - Where are you gonna go? - Nowhere. - Trinidad? - No, probably won't make it. - With the truck, you could just take it and get on outta here. - No, no, no. They'll trace it. - We won't tell anyone. - Shut up! I won't make it. When did you ever hear of an escaped convict who didn't get caught? I just wanted to get some good-ass pussy before they got me. That's all that matters. You want her next? I ain't selfish. Think about it. I did all the hard work for ya. It should be easy from here on out. Go to hell! Already there, honey. Here, lemme help you with that. Don't think you'll need it anymore anyways. Here, eat somethin'. Here you go. You might not be goin' anywhere anytime soon. Might need a little help this time, Kate. Come on. - Please. Please, no. - Come on. - Please, no. - You realize this is all your fault. If you'd just been hospitable, we'd all have gotten along. Come on, come on. You know what to do. - Do that. - Don't get any bright ideas while you're at it. I'll make it worse on your one true love over here. Sorry I have to put you through this, bud. I just don't trust her. Come on. Faster. Faster! Better. Never had it like that in the slammer, goddamn. You bit me. Gonna get some shut eye now. Really takes the life right outta ya. It does. Good morning, sunshine. Don't wait up for me. Dennis? - Dennis. What are you doin' down there, Dennis? Is he still alive? - Yeah, he's alive. I can hear him movin' around. Dennis, don't leave me. - Looks like he don't love you no more, honey! You're damaged goods. Dennis? Dennis, please come back. - Lord, please save us. Please rescue us from this. - What's that? I can't quite hear you down there, Dennis. - We need you right now. Jesus, we need your help. Please deliver us from evil. - Evil. - Lord, God, please. - Amen! Hallelujah. - Dennis?

God, come down the steps. Deliver us. I need you. God, I fucking need you. - That's what's wrong with you people. You ask God to save you when you should save yourselves. - Dear God, what happened to you? Dennis, I had this dream about you and Kate last night and somethin' terrible happened. - They're not dreams, they're real. - Where's Kate? C'mon, we gotta get you both outta here. ♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪ ♪ Halle-lujah ♪ Do you hear anything? No. You eat too loud. Maybe he's dead. Dead, dead, dead. - Are you really gonna let me go? - Sure, why not? - What about Dennis? - What about him? - Do you really think he's dead? - Hell if I know. Maybe he got out and went to Vegas. Do you love him? - We're getting married, so yes. - You just don't seem too broken up that he's gone. - He left without saying anything, just ran off. - Well honey, get used to it. We never stick around. Yeah. How 'bout we go to Vegas? Just you and me. Get hitched, have a little honeymoon. Make all this official. - How far away is Vegas? If that poor soul could see his bride now. Ooh lady, I'd be afraid to tie the knot with you. Do ya think you could ever love somebody like me? Dennis? - Hey, no hard feelings or anything but Kate and I are gettin' hitched in Vegas now. You wanna be my best man? Ow! - Dennis! - Ssh, the cops usually say something first. - Dennis, is that you? - Ssh, shut up. That's a bigger problem. Son of a bitch. I'd rather burn, baby. I'd rather burn. I'd rather burn! Goodbye, darlin'. Muah, it's been special. I'd rather burn! - It's alright, it's alright. Nothin's gonna happen to you. Where is he? - Dennis? - He was going to kill us. - Dennis? - He has eyes like a blazing fire. He has a head of many crowns. He has a name written to him that no one knows but himself. - Why have you forsaken me? Go. - Dennis? You're hurt. You saved us. I need to get you to a hospital. Dennis? Stop! - He is condemned. The great prostitute has corrupted the earth by her adulteries. - Dennis, stop!
