A primitive life form occupying the savage planet Earth. We will land there soon and you will be left, banished. A generous action on our part. Better than you deserve. Banished. Exactly.

I was taking all these aminos and vitamins, eating all this health food and stuff, and I looked great. I'll tell you, I looked great. But, uh, everything's got its price, you know what I mean?

I'm Detective Pierce, and this is Detective Krieger. We're gonna ask you a couple questions, all right? What were you doing in the forest preserve last night? I already told the police. We were hunting. We were hunting deer. With a silencer? That's not what's important. What's important is we saw this flying saucer. Well, I mean, we didn't actually see it. It was more of this, this bright ball of light. And then this, this guy... This monster came out of it. The monster, he looked kinda like a lizard and a bug. A bug? Well, they were fighting. Well, my dad took a shot at him, but it got away. And then the guy, well, he looked kinda normal, at first. He comes up to us like he wants to thank us, or something. But when he gets up to us, he just hits my dad, knocks him down. And then this guy starts shaking, turning into this alien thing. Everything but his head. His head just, just exploded! Just completely disappeared! My daddy sent me for help. I got scared so, uh, so I went for the cops. When we went back there... my daddy... my dad's head was ripped off, and the thing was just, it was gone! Oh, look, I know I sound crazy. I don't know if I believe it myself. But it's true. And we deserve that money. We discovered it. My dad would have wanted it that way. All right, let's cut the bullshit, kid. What the hell were you doing in the forest preserve? Fuck you! You think I'm crazy, right? Would that make everything better, if I was crazy? Is that it? Would that make things better? Okay! All right, Kip, we just need to know what happened. Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you. It's the TV. It gives 'em ideas. The drugs make 'em crazy, and the TV gives 'em ideas. This country's going right into the crapper. Boo! You, come on. Let me go! I'm gonna get you, pig!

Hey, come on, man, don't do that. Hey man, what's the matter? You sick or something? Hey. Come on. Hey, man, spit it out. Hey, man, don't. Come on, spit it out. Oh, man! Jeez. God damn. Isn't that something? What happened to this guy? If I didn't know better, I'd say his head had been squeezed off. The lacerations around the neck are too irregular to indicate anything else, and it appears that a wild animal ate some of Mr Robert Laney, almost immediately after he was dead. Ate him? Not his best day. I have to run some tests yet. Do you think he was killed somewhere else, then dumped in the preserve? Probably not. That would be inconsistent with the condition of the body. Blood would have pooled in various places since the heart wasn't pumping. Connie, what do you think happened to the head? I don't know. Maybe animals took it. Do you think it's still at the scene? Oh, that would make your life a lot easier, wouldn't it? Hey, yo, ain't this the life? Think of all them fools up there running around, punching that clock, kissing somebody's ass, killing themselves for money. Look at us.

I didn't say on his head. I said in his head. This is too strange. And guess what. This one was eaten too.

I'm a police officer and you're under arrest for indecent exposure. Hey, look, Officer, I was just taking a leak, I- - Wipe it up. - Huh? Wipe it up. It's raining! Wipe it. Now. Look, Officer- - Hey, you, you, you. Go on. Get out of here. It's enough. Get outta here. Diana, I wanna talk to you. Krieger, I hate when you do that! I had it under control. Fuck! I think it's time you went home, Diana. I hate that. I hate that shit. You're making much too much of this. I've done it myself, you know. Dogs piss in the street every day. Well, good for dogs, all right? I wanna go home. Okay, kid. Let's go. Come on. Thanks. How you doing? I'm all right. Never a dull moment. Not on this job. Krieger? I've never killed anybody before. It's never easy. Maybe you ought to take some time off, kid. Ah, I'm okay. I'm gonna stay. - Yeah? - Yeah. It's your call. I just finished talking with the FBI. They wanna talk to you guys. About what? About that thing you found last night. They don't know what to make of it. Well, what the hell do you expect us to do? Just explain it away. You can't do that. You have to see it for yourself. It's not human. If it's not human, what is it? Detective Pierce, homicide. Yes. We'll get over there right away. Trouble. That thing we sent Connie, she thinks it's still alive. Connie? We came here as fast as... Connie? Oh, my God. Oh my god. What's going on here? - It's all right. - Everything's under control. Call downtown. Tell Captain Scarcelli to get his ass down here now. Will you do that for me, please? - Right away. - Thank you. You all right? Would you get her some water? You know all that money we're spending exploring outer space? We, we gotta stop. I, uh, I think my nose is broken. Fucking bastard! Take it easy. Take it easy. It's over. It's over. We'll take him. FBI. You can't kill it! It's dead now. Unit 20, come in. Unit 20. Where are they going? They don't know what they're doing. The Feds never do. No. Shoot it!
