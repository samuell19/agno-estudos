No. Are you scared? Come here. I want to hold you in my arms. Come here. I don't want you to think... I don't think anything. Have you ever been with someone? In a man's arms? Have you been naked in a man's arms? You can tell me everything. It was more like a boy... Completely naked? No. Have you ever made love? - No. - No? - You're not with your sister? - No, as you can see. Too bad. What are you doing today? I rented a scooter. In this weather? No thanks. I don't want to be tired tonight. Ask my sister. She's too young. What style do you dance? Come tonight, you'll see! Can't you tell me? Jungle? Hip-hop? It's...sensual. I get it. Too bad about this afternoon. - Will you help me? - Do you want to come up? - Yes, please. Very funny! Mathieu, come help us! Grab her! - No! - Get her feet! No, stop it! I have my period! Shit, stop it! I have my period! So what? So I can't go in the water! Poor thing! Assholes! Marion, my angel, are you taking Hugo to his swim class at 3? I can't. What do you mean, dear? We said last week it would be your turn today. I said I can't. Are you deaf? Do you have to talk to me like that? Do you have to let everyone hear you? Don't make trouble, sweetheart. You're annoying! Listen. Go to the beach if you want, but leave your brother alone! - Let go of me! I've had enough! I'm not his mother! You bring him there! You're always on tour! We're not nannies! That doesn't change anything! I'm not arguing with you. - It doesn't change anything! I don't give a fuck about his class! Ask Juliette! She just hangs around all day, the bitch! - It was my turn yesterday! And what do you do all day? I wonder. - Made a date at 3 pm, eh? - That's my business! Come on, let her scream until she calms down. We'll go over there. When you've calmed down, come over. I will not! I will not calm down! If you knew how ridiculous you are. - I don't care! I don't care! Fuck off! I don't care if I'm ridiculous! - What? - Come on. Why? Come on, you'll see. -I'm happy to see you. -Yes, of course... -What? -Didn't you leave? No, why? I saw you with a bag. Speak clearly, I don't understand. I saw you with a bag! Ah. I just changed rooms. -Are you eating at the hotel tonight? -I don't think so. -And tomorrow night? -I don't know, we'll see, maybe. -Why? Would you like that? -Yes. Hey, not so enthusiastic! Only if you save me a seat next to you, okay? But at the end of the table. I don't want to stay long - we can get away easier. Okay. - Goodbye then. - Goodbye. I have to go. Do you want to meet again? In Paris? If you want. -I do. But do you? -Do you? -Yes. -Are you sure? -Mm-hmm. Go back now. Go on. Hello. Hello. Come in. -Did you find it easily? -No. I went to the street, not to the square. But you didn't want me to pick you up. Come in, please. -It's pretty, that little heart. -I made it myself. It's for me? No. Too bad. I'll get you something to drink. Do you want a grenadine? Yes, sure. That was a dumb joke. I don't have any grenadine. Actually, I don't have much here besides alcohol. -Very funny. -Yeah, I'm a funny guy. I should have bought something, but... Then, water. Do you mind if I drink a beer? No, why would I mind that? You don't want to kiss me? Sorry you came? No. I've been thinking about you since Normandy. It did me good to meet someone like you. Like me how? -I don't know. Different. Someone so... I don't understand how you can kiss someone's feet like that. There's a lot you don't understand. But... -But... -What? I have to make a phone call. Hello? It's me, Marion. What did I want to say... Oh yeah...is tomorrow good, or no? No, I just wanted to make sure. All right - okay. See you later, ciao. -There's also the bathroom, if you want. -Yes, thanks. I'll do it. Let me see. Your breasts are pretty. The little scar is pretty. How did you do that? -I can't remember. -You can't remember? It was...in the nursery. I was bitten. By a boy. -A boy bit you? -When I was little. I guess so, in the nursery. What did you do to him? -I don't know. Nothing. -Nothing? He bit you just like that? It was the first thing I saw. It suits you very well. And what did you like about me? What attracted you to me? Nothing special. Nothing special. -Nothing special. -No, it was chance. It was fate. Then we wouldn't be here. You think it's fate? You ran after me. Nonsense, it was you who gave me your number. Yes, but it was you who called me. Yes, but... -...it was you who gave me your number. -Yes... because you asked me for it. Nonsense. Take your hands away. I just want to caress you. I won't do anything you don't want, I promise. What do we do now? Come on, I'll take you home. -What? -Come on, I said, I'll take you home. -What did I do? -Nothing, don't say that. Come on. No. Listen, I'll return you just as you arrived. Untouched. Stop with the theatre. You're sorry you came, me too. So hurry up, please, hurry up. Take off your T-shirt. No. Let me do it, I just want to caress you. Let me do it. You want it like I do. What we're doing isn't dirty, believe me. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it. I'm going home. I'll give you 100 francs for a taxi. Go home alone, I'm not taking you. Fine, I'm not a whore. I don't owe you anything. It's not my fault. To go after a 14-year-old girl. Like a cheap pickup artist! My mother was right about you! You asshole, you sleaze. You drink, you smoke... ...you don't even see it. You disgust me! You asshole! Fuck off. Get out. I've had enough of this shit today. I can't do it anymore. Look at you! Totally frigid! I don't want you, do you hear me? I don't want you. You make me sick! Get lost! What an asshole! An asshole? Then have fun with your own age group. Go away, now. Get out of here now! Take your stuff and go! Go! Go! You think this is easy? Come on. Leave me alone! Don't touch me! Stop it... Let me go! Please - it's my fault. Forgive me. I'm out of my mind because of you. Stop, please. I need you, I need you, Marion. I love you. Stop. Stop. Why are you so sad? Why are you sad? I'll do what I can for you. Stop it, I beg you. Don't go. I need you, you hear? Don't go. Please, don't go. I love you. Please. Please. Stay with me, please. Stop. Everything will be fine. Ow! It's okay? Stop! -Ow, stop! -What's wrong? You're hurting me. You're hurting me. Ow! Stop! -Did I hurt you? -Yes. It's nothing. It's not a problem. It's not a problem. It's normal. I'll do it. I'm hungry. You're hungry? -What do you want? -Cake...cookies... -Cookies? -Strawberry-flavored cookies. Okay, I'll look for some.
