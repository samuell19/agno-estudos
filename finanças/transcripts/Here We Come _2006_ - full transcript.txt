It was crazy, we sent invitations to all the oldschoolers and I really didn't think many of them would turn up. Langenfeld was there, Downtown Lyrics, some from Boogie Wave. I didn't even recognize those Boogie Wave guys at first. It's been ages, if you think of it. I knew him when he still had all his hair. At some point he looked at me... ...and I wondered why he was staring at me. Then it started to sink in. He asked if I didn't remember him... ...from Dessau. - Rico was there. - Enrico. Matze was there and Michel... ...and not to forget Hany. He even danced. It must be more than 10 years ago... ...that we met each other last time. It was on a news show on TV. They showed Mr. Robot... ...doing his legendary wave. I hadn't seen such a move before. My mum and I were watching and we thought the telly was broken. It was extremely inspiring - I guess it still is. - I was having tea... - No way. It was half seven. I saw this wave running through the screen and I thought: that's wicked! And all the others remained straight. It just looked impossible to me. I saw it on TV, on a game show. They had some guys there who did mirror-dancing and robot-moves. I thought: Wow, what's that? It's cool. What kind of moves are these? In the end the show master asked where they had earned that. They said they had taught themselves by practicing in front of a mirror. Then it clicked and I decided if you can teach it yourself that's what I'll do. I was 13 then. December '83. It was mental! I took my mum's wedding gloves, got in front of the mirror... ...and tried a kind of move like that. Something robot-like. I don't know - I guess I just stood there and tried it out. At some point... ...someone said there'd be another guy doin' it. It was Gero. That's how we met. He asked if I was doing it, too, and I said: sure I am. And he said... Wolfram Otto lived upstairs and one day we got talking... ...about how great it was to move like a robot. He thought so too. And that was sort of how it began. That's where we started from. My first diary entry is from January 1, 1984. It says: "I am making good progress doing the electric boogie." After that it really got going. In Dessau in 1984 all you could do was to choose between three major subcultures. You could be a break dancer or a kind of New Romantic... ...or like Depeche Mode who came at that time... ...or you could belong to the kind of guys wearing sandals... ...tough shirts and jeans... ...but we hated them because they had a habit of chasing us around... They had combs in their back-pockets with chewing gum stickers on them. They were always trying to pinch our hats... ...probably because we looked so nice and colorful. We talked about what it felt like living in East Germany... ...and we all agreed that it was nothing like they make it look in the movies... ...like in "Sonnenallee" for instance and in the media in general. For us it was our normality then. Looking back I have to say... ...I didn't experience it the way it is being presented most of the time. How did they react to break dance? At first they didn't accept it at all. They disapproved. Everybody totally disapproved because it was an American influence... ...and America was a capitalist country which we adored. That was not allowed. Here, Ramo. This is where it happened. The "Stretch Breakers" were founded at this street crossing. We were sitting on the curbstone... ...and we had to think of a name. We had lots of names in mind... - I try to remember what they were - ...but we didn't like any of them. Stretchbreakers sounded good... ...even though we didn't know how to spell it. We really meant something with scratching, but we were too stupid to spell it correctly, so we took "stretch"... ...like in stretch-trousers, meaning flexible. It was out of this confusion really... ...that's how the name came about. "Automatic Freaszy Crew". "Freaszy" isn't even a word, that's just bullshit. We were already in the same Crew at that time. Well, I was definitely proud to have a jacket with my crew name on the back... ...so others knew which group you belonged... ...even if they didn't know your name. People knew: ...that's an Automatic, that's a Stretcher... That was really important. At this crossing there was always something going on. That's where it developed, even as early as '83. That was when we started competing each other. We met here and there and performed. Against each other. People didn't really care, they just liked to watch the moves... ...but we started fighting each other. You could be sure to meet someone there either Saturday or Sunday afternoon. There were benches to sit down and then one day someone brought a linoleum mat. And a tape recorder. - This place had the big advantage... ...that you could check your moves in the shop windows... ...just like in a ballet studio - having mirrors was really important. Sometimes people would come together before any breakdancer had turned up. It was a meeting point. They went to the little cafe "Africana" just across the road... ...and watched out for someone to arrive... ...or until something would happen, like really loud music. Some little guy with a massive ghetto blaster comes along... ...and then it would start. I remember the arguments with my dad. He used to say: "This isn't New York. This is Dessau!" "You can't just walk up to the junction and start dancing." "You're much better off than..." "...those guys in the U.S. who have to dance to earn a living." Each time I answered: "I like doing it. I am a street kid." "You're not!" And then the whole argument would start again: "You don't have to do it." "But dad, I do it because I enjoy it" "and some day, you'll see, it will be just like Rock 'n' Roll, Blues or Jazz." "It will be a new cultural era." It's obvious, it's just like someone dying his hair green today. He wants to attract attention. It isn't relevant why. We looked different, too, we spoke differently... ...we had our own language... ...but we were not in any way politically motivated. Every time I went there I had to push through this crowd of people. I think that's what made me do it. People were interested. People were definitely interested. Were you ever there when they did us in? Yes, quite often... ...with the police coming from all corners. They drove up with a van... ...and backed up... ...against some passage... ...and then they drove us together like in a witch hunt. The only way out was through the passage... ...and straight into their van. I remember, I got away once, but I still had my blaster... ...and I went through an alley, back near where you live... I just wanted to get out, but the van was right there... ...and I ran straight in. - With your recorder! - Yes, with my recorder! Their van fitted exactly into the alley. And I tried to get away with my huge recorder. Then they took us off to police headquarters... ...where they questioned every one of us separately. And what do you think, why did they take you away? Why didn't they want you to hang around there? Because we were questioning socialist values... ...right in the center of Dessau. - By dancing? - Right, by dancing. That was short-lived, however, that they tried to fight us. The movement grew bigger like a wave and at some point they realized... ...they couldn't stop it. So they started to control it. They set up study groups in the schools. Study groups for breakdancing. At that time a lot of... ...youth clubs opened in the new parts of town. This one here is one of the bigger ones. It's called Kreuzer. They increased the number of leisure events... ...and opened up more possibilities for young people. It was only to get us off the streets because otherwise we would... ...have just continued doing it. It was all new to our comrades as well. "So those guys are doing breakdance, that western stuff." "Let's see what that is all about." So it was called "Youthclub of the Free Democratic Youth (FDJ)". Well, we knew it was called breakdance, we knew it was breakdance... ...but East Germany didn't want to call it breakdance. It came in handy really. It kind of freed our minds. We had a lot of fun this way and benefited from it. It was like wearing socialist underpants but still doing American breakdance. When someone came along with stupid arguments now... ...like decadent western subculture and other catchphrases like that... ...we had it written down on a piece of paper... ...why young people in East Germany... ...were doing breakdancing, too: Because they wanted to express their solidarity... ...with the poor and oppressed... ...in New York and in the ghettos. That's why the movie fitted in really well: Beat Street. Yes, then they showed that movie over here. My brother had trouble calming me down. I wanted to join in and go mad. That movie was simply the thing. - Absolutely wicked. - There were a lot of Russian troops in Dresden then, about 100,000... ...and of course their kids had seen Beat Street too... ...and we all danced together in the streets. It was funny - the police came up: "What's all that about?" You know you're not meant to do that. Who says? And they began to write down our names. Horst, who was very quick with answers... ...went up to one of the police officers: "Comrade officer, we are only practicing with our Soviet friends." And he just answered: "Well, okay, have a nice evening", and left. Great. Harry Belafonte was a kind of guru over here. He visited all the time. - He was always invited to shows. - He sang all those protest songs. And when he became co-producer with "Beat Street" everything was settled. Everyone was really interested in his production. And the whole story of the film suited the image America was supposed to have in East Germany. Unfortunately a Bronx hip-hop guy below the bread line... ...still had more style and looked better... ...than anything you could get in East Germany. In the first six months I went to see the movie 35 times. I kept a record. I still have a ticket, it was interesting, I always had the same seat: row 8, seat 13. I went to see it 36 times. At least 20 times. 60 or 70 times. That's Street Beat - this is for us. After I came home from the cinema my parents asked what it was like... ...and I said: Well, it was okay. We watched it so many times... ...we knew all the lines by heart. My tongue is heavy, my stomach is empty, my head is flat, I feel bad... ...and every mornings' strength in vain: same shit again. I'll always remember that. Hey Kenny, why don't you eat your toast? - Yes! I redecorated my room to be able to try out the moves I wanted to imitate. I had done gymnastics before, so I could do handstand, headstand, flic flac. I knew that's what I would do from then on. My goal was to learn doing windmills... ...although I didn't even know what they were called at the time. You saw it but you couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe how someone could just fly across the floor... ...with his legs up in the air. I simply wanted to be able to do it myself. We called it the "Helicopter" East Germany's nickname: "Heli". Li, the little boy in Beat Street, had a particular way of walking... ...and we all used to imitate him. I was ecstatic when I heard... ...the title track for the first time. I had never heard of it before but it triggered something inside my head: This was what I had been looking for, this was what I wanted. We didn't have a book or anything. There was just this film. So we went to see it twenty times. - Just to look at one particular scene. - We tried to memorize the moves and later discussed them for 5 minutes: how do they work, where do I put my hands... ...and then we started practicing in malls or in the middle of the street. People standing in a circle. A guy is doing the helicopter... ...and we couldn't see how he was doing it. So we tried it out and ended up inventing the Babyspider. The one I tried over and over again making a complete fool of myself. That's another East German thing. Wicked. It was almost impossible to get it right. It was a short sequence... ...in which he is doing the moonwalk and they put a fat baseline to it. And the scene where the Latino is playing the conga. You could hear the bass through the door. It comes from above; definitely wicked! All the people, the moves... It was similar to the euphoria when the wall came down! People left the cinema and all they wanted to do was dance, spray and rap! Aerosols were immediately confiscated after the release of Beat Street. We had to use paint and brushes for graffitis. We also started painting our T-Shirts. So that we could at least wear our pictures if not stick them on walls or metro wagons. I did a huge sweatshirt, which took me more than a year to finish... ...and then showed it to my mum. - It was painted on with textile colours. She liked it and washed it for me. The thing is - I hadn't ironed it yet. The paint had to be ironed in. It came out of the washing machine and the picture was gone. The colours survived lots of washings - good stuff, those East German colours. All that was left was the white primer. But the picture had taken me more than a year had gone. I cried. My mum tried to comfort me and said... ...that there still was a bit left to be seen and that made me cry even harder. "Equality, brotherhood and Social security" There's Beatschmidt in his yellow hat. Me with a black hat and sun shades. He is everything I would have liked to have and do: There are sneakers I couldn't buy. Scratching on the globe. What else? Doing graffitis - never done that. All my dreams are on there really. A ghetto blaster, I never could afford. Our whole lives revolved around the movie. We dressed like them and never mind what people thought of us. We wore tracksuits all day to be prepared to start dancing any minute. Our purpose in life was meeting other people on the streets... ...and dancing with them or against them. That's what it was all about. I painted "Puma" stripes on my sneakers. They were uneven in size... ...but when you stood like that it didn't show. The shoes were jeans sneakers I got as a present once. I just painted them white. Do you remember them? They were called "meal voucher shoes" because they were the same price... ...as a week's meal vouchers in school: 2,75 East Marks. We wanted to look like our heroes. They used to wear special shoelaces: fatlaces they were called which did not exist over here, of course. We had to improvise, we used a sort of cheap trimming material. Bernhard was the first to pick up on the technique. Each hole twice! They were that big we had to burn large holes into our shoes. Then we cut dad's old vests apart... ...and twisted them so they looked like sausages... ...and then you could fashion them into a 4. The insteps were much too small and it looked like shit... ...even with our improvised fatlaces. So we padded them with foam material. Then it looked like straight from the movie. You are easily influenced at that age and you're full of yearning... ...for the unreachable; especially if you're from East Germany and someone... ...rubs a "Nike" shoe under your nose. Carlos from "Breakcollection" is a Chilean and he was allowed go to West Berlin. He used to buy those wicked tracksuits... ...while we had to wear our hand-made stuff. Heiko waited for me in East Berlin. I wanted to go to West Berlin to get the suits and the shoes. The 100 mark notes had a silver strip... ...and I said they had to be taken out in case they had metal detectors... ...at the frontier and they would find out. There was a trick to it. You could roll the note between your fingers where the silver strip was so the note grew soft. - Absolute experts. - Then you could pull the strip out. We'd seen the movie, we wanted to do it and had to start from scratch. We had to improvise. Where should we dance? What should we wear? - What foundation could we dance on? - We didn't have sneakers, you see? We didn't have tracksuits. Once we went to Berlin to look for them. What kind of shoes are good for dancing? We had to try all this out: shoes too heavy, pants uncomfortable, the lino floor is not right... ...how do THEY do it? These thoughts dominated our lives. There were exchange bureaus where one could change East German money... ...into Deutsch Marks. 20 DM for 100 East Marks. I got in line - ...probably being watched by Stasi agents ...handed them a bundle of money and got about 1000 Deutsch Marks. We asked our mums to copy us some original "Puma" tracksuits. We bought the cheapest fabric, sewed in white "Puma" stripes... ...and copied the "Puma". It looked perfectly authentic. Black and white - we made it all ourselves. I met Gabor through dancing. He had studied to become a cartoonist. I visited him a couple of times and he showed me some of his stuff. And because he was so into dancing... ...it was probably the most obvious thing... ...to do a cartoon on breakdance or Hip Hop in general. The music was a problem when I started the cartoon... ...because no one in East Germany could perform or produce that kind of music. I did the animations in the right rhythm even though I didn't have... ...any music to go with it. I wanted to put music to it later, so I did the animation... ...and the editing so that it would fit to Hip Hop beats. We didn't have phones, no-one had a car... ...just talking to people or passing letters around. You saw someone dancing, a ghetto blaster on a streetcorner... ...and someone was wearing white gloves... ...or a baseball hat or those awful mirrored glasses... ...you could guess they were into that kind of stuff. It was here where we all got together for the first time... ...and eventually the town realized there was a movement of some kind... ...and that we actually had something going on. East German open workshop; that was the first official title for it. That was our "Battle of the Year", where we met once a year. Leipzig was the heart of it all. This was never official, of course. It was the unofficial GDR championship. It was never officially recognised. Workshop in Leipzig: we have to be there! Just to imagine, an event that was all about breakdance. It was something special. Outside everyone did their warm-ups; it was really exciting. And the actual dancing took place over here. It wasn't as bright as it is now. There used to be a porch which made it quite dark. - What about those partitions? - The partitions didn't exist. It was one open hall. I remember, when we did win it was a real rush of adrenalin for me. I couldn't believe it. It must have been one of the best days of my life. I can still remember it a hundred per cent. I just stood there and felt like crying. "And the winners with 85 points are the Dynamics." The officials were looking for some way to get young people motivated... ...and excited to become culturally active. And Hip Hop was their crutch. It is important to know that everything that wasn't totally Underground... ...was watched and classified and acknowledged... ...by the Ministry of Education and Arts. And as breakdance was publicly classified it also became... ...a publicly tolerated movement. We had those political puppets sitting in the relevant committees... ...who decided on how artistic the various groups were. At some point it got complicated... ...because more and more groups pushed into the market. There were organized classification events with up to 10 groups... ...performing one after the other and then the culture guys classified them... ...into basic, medium or advanced level. Within these categories you could be good, very good or excellent. It says it on here. You won't believe it. This is my dancing license. See regulations for recognition of artistic qualities and classifications... ...of People's Art Collectives and Solo Artists. Warranted People's Arts Collective of East Germany: breakdance group "Quick Animation." "Breakdance from exhibition center Leipzig with the BigCityBreakers." Only valid in combination with group classification. The license to dance. As a solo artist you were nothing. Of course it was political, because it was... ...a means of avoiding the officially decreed way of celebrating. It also was a kind of subculture... ...because there was no public awareness for a long time. Even the official representatives who towards the late 80's started... ...to embrace everything that smelt of subculture weren't fully aware. I spoke to our First Secretary and told him how it really was. He didn't like American subculture... ...and pointed out that we didn't want Western influences. So I said, "But this is something in its own right..." "...I've witnessed it during the workshop in Leipzig." That was very important in East Germany; they wanted an independent... ...socialist entertainment, free of Western tendencies. At first... ...the word "breakdance" disappeared... and I had to use that funny expression "Acrobatic show dance"... ...which sounded absolutely ridiculous. "Worker's house" "Sportforum activist" "Clubhouse Maxim Gorki" "Country Culturehouse" Breakdance was banned because it was considered an American influence... ...which had negative effects on the education of East German juveniles. That's how they would talk. It really was an American movement and then all of a sudden... ...the East German cultural cabinet becomes interested and from... ...one minute to the next it is no longer a danger but encouraged by the system. "And what do the experts have to say about American breakdance?" Those guys are doing it independently. They do what they want whereas we are made. I wanted them to get a professional license... ...so they needed a distinctive artistic profile. I told them, "If you do sports, it's just sports." "If you add some culture and make it into a show..." "...it's culturally valuable, that's what we want." They agreed. I had some artistic ideas: A couple of elderly people... ...talk about what to do that night. And then out of this dialogue "The Dynamic Crew" develops. "Hi Paul, can I have a fag?" "Of course, Franz!" "Not bad, your stuff." That kind of entertainment had its peak in '86 or '87. That was too much like ballet for us. It wasn't true, it wasn't the street. It felt more like a Punch and Judy show to me and Beatschmidt. He was the biggest anti-programmist. He hated doing synchronized movements. And believes in a line where one person comes up in front... ...and does his best moves. That is what breakdance is all about. Everything else is plain ballet. "Hey, what's all that about?" "You can ask! No sane person can stand it! What do you say?" "Yo!" They would always tell us how we were supposed to perform "a show". Too many regulations, if you ask me. Once they said we weren't funny enough. They wanted us to include something funny. I'll just get some more paper. Let's see, it used to be able to do 8 carbons. In the end the Free German Youth booked us... ...for parties with the big shots. Yes, we even got money for it. I can still feel their grip on my arm... ...when they arrested me and then all of a sudden everything was great. Breaklooping came next. It was the biggest thing. "Hello Breaker." "Dear Breaker." "Dear Breakfriends" It still works. Fantastic. What suffered from all this was the technique... ...breakdance itself and its development in East Germany. It sounds stupid but we got really very commercialized. We earned quite a lot of money, more than out of any other job. I remember an event in Görlitz or so. "Boogie Wave" didn't show up... ...they just didn't show up and the event had already started. It was nothing like today, like driving to Dresden or Rostock in 2 or 3 hours. Even a trip to Jena was quite a journey. It took five to six hours. Suddenly someone called the organizers and said "Boogie Wave" were on their way. Their car had broken down and they had organized a tractor because... ...even then no-one wanted to tow a car with a bunch of youngsters in it. The organizers turned the music down and you could hear the tractor arrive... ...and all the kids went wild: That's "Boogie Wave" arriving! The atmosphere was great, it was fun. Once we had more gigs than there were days in the month. We had two or three gigs a day depending on the distance between the locations. In our best time we had 240 performances per year. We had a flat for ourselves, a flat that was reserved for artists. It was in Berlin when we were 15 or 16, we played at the "Palast der Republik"... ...at night and got money for it. No-one in school did that. We usually went to bed at about 5 a.m. and had breakfast at lunchtime. It was chaos. And cleaning up! The places where we spent the night had to be cleaned up. It was hilarious, they had their ghetto blasters in the corridors... ...and off they went with the brooms. They would go to bed listening to Hip Hop... ...and in the morning... ...before they even brushed their teeth, they would turn the music on. "Theater spectacle." "Theater Spectacle", that's what it was called. We came up on stage with the lifting platform. We were all wearing gray suits with our names... ...graffiti style, written on the front. We appeared in a cloud of fog, right after "Johnson Crew's" performance: "Space is the place". I remember some live band playing. - I have to put that records on! And up we went! Do you get goose pimples, too? I was sure we would become the next Beatles. That's how it turned out. - Then we were up... ...and with the first beats... ...we walked to the front of the stage boogie style. Then the spotlights shifted... ...and I didn't look into the light but into a crowd of a few thousand people. I thought, I'd die or pass out - the place was sold out... ...and all these people were staring directly at me. That's how it felt, anyway. The feedback was incredible... ...the audience was screaming and clapping. And it did feel like... ...am I a star now? "East German Television" The host announced the TV ballet. They were standing at their positions, but then our music came on... And they had to leave the stage... ...because their music wasn't ready. So we were allowed on. I did a choreography for one hundred breakers... ...and we practiced in the schoolyard for I don't know how many days... ...so that everyone would get the moves right... ...and in the end: Honnie! (Erich Honecker) Everyone waved! - Everyone waved. I don't know if he even watched, he waved all the time, to everyone. Woosh - everyone was on the street circling on the floor. No, that's not true. - Sure! The front rows were to start on their knees... ...and a wave should go through the back rows. But the State Security walked up to those who were the first to kneel down... ...and that was it, everyone had to stand up again and the show was over. The whole choreography went down the drain. In '88 I distanced myself from commercial breakdance. I was part of the underground, showed up here and there... ...enjoyed myself with the others and that was it. Later we just started to rap because we got bored watching the others dance. We wanted to do something besides... ...holding the hats or coats of others while they danced or asking... ...if they wanted another beer. You couldn't get any equipment in East Germany. We did have some tape decks and a mixing panel... ...so we just cut together sound fragments with two tape decks: Pause, record, pause, record. We tried to get the beat right... ...and calculated a few extra seconds... ...to make it fit in the end. Boom, Boom, Boom, rewind, back in, press record, boom, boom, boom... ...cut it together. That's how the first mixes were born. We did that for half a day, editing it together three times. That got us a 2-minute instrumental to which we could rap. I thought I can't go to America anyway so there was no motivation... ...to learn English and to stay in school two hours longer than everyone else. I preferred practicing my Breakdancing to being stuck in school learning English. So I did have problems with the language but I still wanted to rap. After a folk group you can't very well do breakdance. Mono players - I got my first tape deck when I was eight. I still have it. It's over there in the window. Like to see it? It looks a bit worse for wear but it was the first one I had. Wow, how it shoots those tap out - really spontaneously. If you took the cover off, you could change... ...the speed of the motor. That's how pitching became possible. You could slow down fast beats... ...and make different beats fit better. I didn't even know they were using record players for scratching. I just heard a sound being scratched backwards and forwards. We had this mixer, a mono-mixer with triangular knobs for fading. Because of their shape they were hard to use. It was bad for scratching and at some point they just broke. What was left were tiny little shafts which were much better for scratching. Or we would build in light switches... ...because once the knobs were broken, that was it. It sounded like "djidji" and he could add "dadat dadadat". Human beat box was the thing... ...because hardly anyone could afford a drum computer. We had the opportunity to do a show on East German Radio. Unfortunately it was named after the German word for vibrations: "Vibration" - awful. There I had the chance to get to know Reggae and African music better... ...and I realized that Hip Hop would fit in quite nicely. Electric Beat Crew was East Germany's... ...commercially successful answer to Hip Hop. True Hip Hop, however, was taking place somewhere else... ...and quite successfully: in the "Tonhalle" in Radebeul. Everyone who was into Hip Hop at the time went there. People were streaming in by hundreds! You could hear the basses... ...as soon as you got out of the train. It is pretty quiet here and those houses did not exist at the time. In the summer when you came down here birds would be singing... ...walkers came by... ...and then sound check started. Some old guy walking his dog would go: "What on earth?" We had to find someone to host it. So I called a friend, an actor, and he agreed to do it. Well, he didn't show up and the show got closer and closer... ...so I said: "Okay, I'll do it." - And then you hosted it. - I had never been on a stage in my life and didn't know what would happen. So I just said: "Good evening, Radebeul"... ...and 2000 fans started to scream. GDR-Hip Hop, exactly, we are the Members. Rap didn't exist, it wasn't singing... ...so we didn't have a chance. Thankfully there was this "Rap Contest..." ...and drew attention to the movement... ...and to the fact that there were rappers in East Germany... ...that there was a universal Hip Hop family. We had a song which was about not wanting to be like "ElectricBeatCrew"... ...who were performing at the time and sounded very commercial. One song was called: "We are not commercial". Parts of the lyrics even made it into the English "Soul Underground" magazine. They asked how a band from East Germany could write lyrics like that... ...while they couldn't be commercial under their system anyway. Later we had to agree that they had a point: the lyrics were bullshit. Those lyrics came about... ...because at times we simply weren't conscious of living in East Germany. The world came to us. We didn't have to get out anymore. I personally didn't. You had a different opinion... ...but I was content. I could live... ...a Western Life in the East. That's how it was. I used my talents and made money out of them. Everything was fine. I couldn't have asked for more. - All went really well. - Yes, for you came a time around 1988... A little earlier even... ...when you just wanted to get out. I had the first problems when I was in kindergarten. - Political problems. - Not consciously political. I was always a little rebellious. My behaviour and what I said didn't conform. Her disposition did not agree with the East Germany system. From the age of thirteen I knew I wanted to leave this country. I didn't really know how but I just thought I'd apply for a visa. I knew I had to be 18 first to apply... ...and then wait for another 6 years. So I guessed I would leave the country at 25 or 26. I knew all this when I was 13. "Peter, some people from State Security are coming". "They'll send someone over to find out what we're doing". We met in his flat... ...and some guy turns up... ...a middle-aged, laid back guy. "Hello, State Security, I would like to ask you some questions." "My boss doesn't know what you're doing. So what is it exactly you're doing?" And I say: "Youth culture, USA." And then he goes: "Oh, USA". "Well is there an equivalent in Russia?" And I go: "Of course. Definitely." At the beginning I was really scared... ...but after the third question we realized that everything went smoothly... ...and peacefully without the use of baseball bats. Everyone who watched closely knew what was happening. - Personally, I didn't. - I did. I didn't feel watched over. I always used what was on offer. I didn't think about someone spying on me. That just gets you down. At some point you just have to learn to live with it. Every system has its advantages and disadvantages. I knew I wanted... ...to get out of there. I had a crucial experience in Hungary. My granddad had invited us for a holiday. His children were still students and lived the high life... ...while my parents had worked so hard all their lives like small squirrels. So I fled for economic reasons. I knew that's not what I wanted... ...to slave away all my life and still feel like shit in comparison... ...with people who haven't achieved anything simply because they lived... ...under a different social system. I couldn't deal with that. "Number 65 from East Germany." Number 65. Hungary was something special. It was a contest for dancing in general and breakdance was included. The best from East Germany would also be invited. So she was invited. And since we had decided earlier that we wanted to leave East Germany. We took it as a chance because everyone said Hungary already had open borders. But that was in May '89, there were no open borders then. When we bought a compass they told: Easy border, just cross it. That was wrong, there was still security, alarm systems and all that. They simply waited until someone came out of the bushes... ...or they would take their dogs in there. We could hear the dogs. Then the sun came up. We were just a short distance away... ...from the border, hidden in some bushes. We heard them talk in Hungarian... ...and then they found us and forced us to surrender. There was no other option then... ...even though we were barely 20 metres from the Austrian border. We saw the signs: 22 metres. - We had almost made it. We took some friends to the station, who emigrated that summer. Looking back it's really hard to describe how we felt. At the station we said goodbye to people... ...who took direct trains to Western Germany. That was on our minds all the time... ...sitting at home, crying about all the friends who had gone. We didn't know how things would develop. After some days in Budapest we were handed over... ...to East Germany, to the Security. So we were political refugees, prisoners. Some Stasi guy came up to us... ...and said: "Listen..." Then he opened his jacket. - Showed his gun and said... "You can keep your hands down." It was just a normal bus for tourists... ...going to the airport. He said: "You can stay there and be quiet or I'll shoot you. I don't care." I left Dresden on a Friday night. On Monday morning arrived in Hamburg. That was my getaway. All the others made it. We were just a little too early. We were the unlucky ones paving the way. In the West I realized how important friendships... ...and your surroundings are. I felt really lonely and homesick. I watched the reunification on TV... ...and the tears were streaming down my face. They were showing footage of bridges... ...on which people were hugging each other. It was all really traumatic in a good way. During that time things happened... ...which were physically impossible. The wall came down in '89... ...and we wondered if... ...anyone in Western Germany... ...still did or wanted to see breakdance. GDR breakdance culture... ...with classifications and making money out of it was all over. No-one was interested any longer and everything we'd had was dead. All the cultural values of the past were thrown away just like that. The community never really got back together again. It broke apart because of all the other attractions. Everyone wanted to earn money, own a car... ...and buy what he thought he had missed for the last 20 years. Foolish of course - because... ...other values were much more important. But you don't realise that until later. "We WANT to work HERE" "Closing down" "BUY FOR YOUR LIFE" It was a huge disappointment for many of us... ...that all the creative opportunities... ...which were emerging in fall '89... ...were rejected by the majority of people... ...in order to become part of an established, bourgeois community... ...that wasn't so very different from the one... ...we'd had to live in for so many years. When they were saying: My plan is called Starbucks. Everyone took on different jobs. Everyone wanted to earn money. Just think of all the possibilities! There simply wasn't any more room for coming together. In spring 1990 we still did 30 events. In the second half of the year though... ...the organizers told me there wasn't any money to continue. They closed the youth club in Wolgast and the club at the harbor. There was nowhere, we could practice any longer. We would have continued if there had been an opportunity. We took what we could get from East Germany. - Definitely. - We were ready for something new. And that's what happened. As soon as we had this poor, tiny flat we arranged our bedroom in a way... ...that allowed us to move everything quickly to start dancing again. And the beat goes on... That's what I love about it. I'm on the road every weekend, dj-ing. That's what I live for. It's almost as wicked as breakdance. Dancing is so important, breakdancing is the most important thing. Our purpose in life. The only thing... ...we could identify with, what we felt a part of. In the end it was like when we had left East Germany. We were stuck in a never-ending cycle of work, flat and social security... ...all those things we hadn't wanted in the first place. I sat here and considered what the hell to do. Going to West Germany? But why? All I can do is working in this youth club. So I stayed, held out and made the best of it. And because of people like Kretschi there was still Breakdance on Mondays... ...and people from back then. It helped in developing... ...the whole culture out of our shared history. The greatest thing was battling members of the Rocksteady Crew in New York... ...the guys from the movie we all loved so much. And that was it. I danced against my old heroes and that was it. All the old legends came to Schalowa. A jam session. And we met and just had a great party. - It was a hell of a party. - Crazy Legs saw her dance and was gobsmacked. He came over and hugged her and that was when we realized... ...that even a guy like him finds it incredible what the girl had just done. Naturally that was a milestone for me. Someone from Beat Street telling me... ...what a great performance I'd given. I wouldn't have dreamt of that then. Even though we had settled down in West Germany... ...that was the best thing that happened to us. People spent their everyday life there... ...with positive and negative emotions... ...and it was as diverse as anywhere else. I don't understand why young people ask... ...how we could live there, within that system. Well, I did not know anyone whom I could have called the system... ...so I just ask back: How do we live with our system now? How can we live with the system that exists right now?
