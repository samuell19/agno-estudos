Apparently they were thwarted because we have blue skies today, Bill. What's the story? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Can we order now, please? I'll be right back, okay? Just let me drop these off.

RENO: It might be a good idea to find out why, maybe clear yourself, maybe even find out what that fuckin' key is for. [SIGHS] [PANTING] Shh. [INSECTS CHIRPING] [PANTING] Wait a second. [PANTING] I found this back at the bar. [PANTING] This is my roommate's boyfriend. It's Brady. He was here in San Lucas. Yeah, Michelle's boyfriend. MAXINE: What? How did you know that?

There's only a couple hours left before the Festival begins. Man, I really screwed this one up. I don't know if this'll help, but-- RENO: Don't know if what'll help?

[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING IN SPANISH] RENO: No, no, not tonight. [SINGING IN SPANISH] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SINGING IN SPANISH] Where's Blake and the Greek? Out shining their shoes. SOAMES: I have a callout to Deltoid. He says if he doesn't get his bloody cup by tonight, we can piss off. What do you say, Charlie? I say she doesn't have it. She says she doesn't know anything about it. I got that bit out of her in a few seconds. What you been doin' for two days, my love? Ticklin' other's fancy? Look, I believe her. I don't know where we blew this thing, but the trail is cold. Well, it better get fuckin' hot again. "Leave her to me," you said. "I'll win her confidence." Yeah, well, your method with Brady was equally effective. Icing him before you get the traffic. That was Damalas. Anyway, Brady didn't have the key on him. He had to give it to this Michelle. Well, Max didn't kill Michelle. What's your concern about her, Charlie? Where is she? The deal's over. Oh, not hardly, Charlie. You haven't been tryin'. I guess that's up to you. [TELEPHONE RINGING] SOAMES: You're taking this awfully well, Charles. Bar Sin nombre? I can't sit through another double-cross, frankly. Gives one a very sore ass. WAITER: Telephono para usted. Great. And what do I tell Deltoid, Charlie? Soames, se va? SOAMES [OVER PHONE]: We haven't got it yet. Uh-hmm. SOAMES [OVER PHONE]: But the girl's here. You needn't bother. SOAMES [OVER PHONE]: You gave me the day. Uh-hmm. Uh-uh, there is no more time. Brady's girlfriend just called me. She'll be here in one hour. I'm dealing directly with her now. She insists that she has no understanding with any of you. Stay in touch. Well? You bloody twit. She's giving it to him herself. Cut her own scam. Nah, that's not possible. -Not her. -She's very good. She did you, Charlie. The bitch double-crossed you. Oh, the deal is going down, but it's going down twisted. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [FIRECRACKERS CRACKLING] Get out of the fuckin' way! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [FIRECRACKERS CRACKLING] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] WOMAN: [SPEAKS SPANISH] Yeah. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Did my sister-in-law come around here at all? [SPEAKS SPANISH] Um, mi cuniado. Ah, Tu cuniada? Mi cuniado, si, si... [SPEAKS SPANISH] Yeah, yeah, si, si, si, gracias. Gracias. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Oh, oh, okay. Vice, man, Miami Vice, now take a walk. Vamanos! -You drug smuggling freak! -[SPEAKS SPANISH] You freak! Funeralia, my ass! Don't even breathe. [GASPS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Taxi! MAXINE: Shall we share a cab? Brady planned for us to be in the car when it blew up. Maxine was supposed to be the witness. And when everyone believed we were dead, we'd meet up back here. RENO: Well at least Soames was right about one thing. Brady didn't have the key on him. Open him up. I can't. Open him up! I can't. It was your idea. I can't. Thanks a lot. MICHELLE: It's not my fault he swallowed it. RENO: Oh, man. Deltoid! Well? Nothing. Three million dollars. Give me the gloves. Give me the gloves! He's lucky they threw him out the window. So they wouldn't have to doan extensive autopsy. Oh yeah? He's one lucky stiff. MAXINE: Look, I don't know anything about a key and I don't know anything about a Crucible. I wish I could help you. I'm sorry, Mr. Deltoid. I don't think you understand. There's nothing to fear from me. I'm the source. Home base. I merely want to conclude this transaction, that's all. A young girl like you, there's a lot you can do with three million dollars. Sorry I can't help you. DELTOID: Then why did you call earlier? I didn't call. Perhaps I'm mistaken about other things as well. Anna, [SPEAKS SPANISH] gracias. Five minutes. Five minutes. You two come to an arrangement. MAXINE: Mr. Deltoid, wait, please. SOAMES: Let's cut the bullshit,shall we? [SIGHS] [COUGHS] Looks like we have a winner. Five minutes is not a long timeto come to terms. So let's be brief. He gets the cup, I get the money and you get to live. That way, we all come out of it and nobody loses face. Alright! Alright. I'll tell you where it is. Brilliant, love, where? The billiard hall. What billiard hall? [SCOFFS] I'm not an idiot. Prove it. I'll take you there. And I want half. Your plane is ready, Senor Deltoid. DELTOID: [SPEAKS SPANISH] Mr. Deltoid, Charlie sent me. DELTOID: Charlie? He has the Crucible. He wants to make a new deal. DELTOID: Uh-huh. MICHELLE:Bring the three million dollars. Am-mut, get the money. AM-MUT: Yes, sir. [LAUGHING] Charlie, you did it again. [LAUGHING] Eh, change your mind? SOAMES: No, come to her senses. DELTOID: Uh-huh. Michelle! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SPEAKS SPANISH] Can you hear me? Rapido, rapido. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR HORN HONKS] MAXINE: You set me up, you almost had me killed! -Shut up. -No, I won't shut up. You make me so mad! God, what I ever do to you, huh? What'd I ever do to you? [SPEAKS SPANISH] -Just tell me why. -For the money. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] SOLDIER: Vamanos, muchachos. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MAXINE: Michelle, I want you outof my apartment and I want you out of my life. Is that clear?

Listen, whatever happens in the next few minutes, just play along. Then go straight to the American Embassy. I thought you said they'd turn me in. I lied. SOLDIER: [SPEAKING SPANISH] I don't understand you. RENO: Hold that. Who are you, really? Just a hard working thief. Here, take these. -SOLDIER: [SPEAKS SPANISH] -[GUN COCKS] They're in there. -They're in there! -SOLDIER: [SPEAKS SPANISH] -What are you gonna do? -Improvise. I've got a hostage here.
