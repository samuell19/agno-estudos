While political and economic tensions rise across the globe, a new report shows that an even more dire trend is rising, nuclear proliferation. With the breakdown of various arms treaties, analysts say the manufacturing of nuclear weapons is now at an all-time high, since the end of the Cold War. This new arms race and current political rhetoric has caused many expert to conclude that a nuclear confrontation between multiple nations is inevitable. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Go, go, go! - Ah, let go! Eastern Standard Time. The president has moved the nation's defenses to DEFCON 2. Not since the Cuban Missile Crisis, in 1962, has the United States Armed Forces been on this high of alert. Threats of a nuclear-scale attack have been issued to West Coast cities, such as Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and as far east as Dallas and Chicago. We go now to our White House correspondent, John Smith. - Thank you, Carl. - Hello. Hey, sis, how's it goin'? - Hey, it's, it's goin'. When do you leave? - Tomorrow morning at 8 a.m. Fun! - Yeah. Have you been watching the news? - Yeah, it's nuts. Will you see James before you leave? - Yeah, he's coming over at like 6:30 or so. Okay, good luck with that. And be safe. I'll see you at Mom's, tomorrow night. - Yeah, thanks, I will. Hey, have you heard from Dad? No, he's doin' his thing again. He and Karen were supposed to come back yesterday, but I think they're extending their stay in Bermuda. Who knows how long, this time? - That's typical. Yeah. - Well, you know, whatever. I can't wait to see you and Mom. We can't wait. Love you, okay, kisses. Bye. - Love you, bye. In case you are just now tuning in, as of 6 p.m., Eastern time, the president has placed the U.S. military on DEFCON 2 status. And the problems are intensifying with further heated rhetoric from the president. With the situation deepening, panic across the nation has been growing. Officials are encouraging everyone to cease all but emergency travel, for the next 24 hours, until diplomacy can diffuse this nearly unprecedented crisis. And in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, a strict travel curfew will be in effect at 7 p.m., Pacific Standard... - Hello. - What up, dude? - Hey, man, what's goin' on? What you doin' tonight? - I am going to Katie's. Ah, is it tonight? - Yeah. - Dang. Wait, why don't you come out afterwards? The band's pretty low tonight, with the whole crisis and all. We'll do a little jam, too. We gotta practice for that gig next Tuesday night, anyway. - Ah, no, man. Yeah, I'm good. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you. The, uh, the gig Tuesday got canceled. Damn. - Yeah. - All right. - All right. - The offer still stands. Maybe it'll cheer ya up. - Yeah. Yeah, I'll think about it, for sure. All right, I'll have a cold one waiting for ya. - All right, thanks, man. - All right, cool. I'll see ya tonight. - Yeah, I'll talk to you later. - That's a definite. - All right. - Okay. I'll see you soon. - All right, bye. Bye. - There he is. - James! - My man, Antonio. - Hey. - Good to see you, man? - Good to see you, again. - You doing good? - I'm good. How are you? - Yeah, I'm good. I've been all right, yeah. - Traffic, uh, pretty bad out there? - Oh yeah, you know, this attack scare's got everyone runnin' crazy, you know, but, yeah, man, it's good to see you. - Okay. - Yeah. - Yeah, good to see you. - All right, later, man. The delegation at the U.N. has turned into a high-stakes poker match, with world leaders- - Hey. - Hey. While holding their fingers on launch buttons. - Can I come in? Yeah. - Thanks. - This will forever change the course of the world, just as Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and the Missile Crisis. - How you been? - Good. You? - Yeah, I've been good. - And San Diego and Los Angeles are having a difficult time managing panicked residents. This is footage, live from Los Angeles' 405 Freeway, as citizens try to flee the city. - Are you still planning to fly out, tomorrow? - Yeah. - I mean, I'm pretty sure they're gonna cancel all the flights. Dangerous and unnecessary. - The papers are right here. - Hmm. Thanks. In Portland and Seattle, the curfew starts at 8 p.m., Pacific Time, until 8 a.m. Airports in each of those coastal cities are grounding all evening flights and rerouting- - Told you. - I'm sure it'll all blow over by tomorrow. They're making a big deal out of nothing. How long will you be goin' for? - Uh, two weeks. - Really? Hospital's gonna give you two weeks off? - Yeah, it's just one of the perks about having a good job. - Ah. You thinkin' of moving back? - Can you just... I don't want this to take that long. - All right, right, sorry. You know, I read everything I sign. - Since when? - It's been a while since we've seen each other. - Also, you've had two weeks to look this over. - Just, you chill out, okay? - Well, I'm not packed. I have a lot to do, so- - All right, go do it, that's fine. I'll be right here. Don't worry about me. - Okay. - I'm fine. Seriously. - All right. - I'm not gonna steal anything, promise. Be in the bathroom. - Katie? Katie, I signed the papers. - Okay. I'll be right out. Okay, I guess that's it then. - Well- - Well what? You signed everything, right? - Yeah, no, it's just, it's this mandatory curfew. It started like 10 minutes ago, but I, I don't know how serious it is. - There's like a million people on the freeway. I don't think anyone's gonna- - Babe, will you just- - Don't call me that. - It's gonna take me three hours to get to Van Nuys, right now, and people are scared. I would just prefer not to be on the roads. - Okay, then where are you gonna go? Absolutely not. - It's not, it's not, it's just not safe. Okay. I just would prefer not to be in the middle of the freeway if something happened. I don't think that's crazy. - I think you're overreacting. - You saw the TV. You think I'm overreacting? - Fine. Fine. - Thank you. - Just don't come into the bedroom, okay? Into L.A., you must take cover immediately. I will repeat that. If you are in the L.A. area, don't hesitate. You must take- - Katie? Are you okay? Hey, hey! You okay? What the hell was that? What? What the hell was that? - Food, food, water, water, whatever you have, put it in a bag now. Let's go, let's go. Let's go, get a bag, a bag, just grab a bag! We're leaving in 30 seconds. Here. Oh shit! - Thank you. Where's your phone? Grab your phone. Mine's not working. No, no, it's not turning on. - Um, do you have that map, the map, the map when we first- - No, I don't know what you're talking about! - When we moved here, we bought a map. - Where? I got it, I got it, I got it. Where are we going? Where are we going! - I don't know. I don't know. Antonio, Antonio! You okay? - All the cars, they're not working. What are you talkin' about? What are you talkin' about- - We can't escape. - Hey, stay right here, for me, all right. You're bleeding. We're gonna- - We can't escape. - Escape what? Talk to me, hold on. Stay right here. - The bomb shut them off. I think we're under attack. Attack, what? - I have to get my things. - You need to stay- - Whoever attacked... I have to get my things. - Come on. Hold on, hold on, hold on! - Wait, wait, wait. Antonio, Antonio! - We need to go. Katie, we need to go. - Wait, was he sunburned, when you saw him earlier? - What? - Shit. - None of the cars are working. - Hey, hey, hold on, hold on. - Antonio, look at me. Look at me, all right? You're gonna be okay. - No one's car's working. - I'm gonna help you. - I'm goin' on foot. - How do you know that the cars aren't working? Hey, how do you know that the car's aren't working? - Antonio! - Where are you going? - San Diego! I have family there. We have to go now! - Hold on, hold on! - You're going to San Diego on foot! What are you talkin'... All right, grab the bag, let's go. Katie. Katie, we have to go now. - We need to get inside now. Those are radiation burns on his face and neck. - Half of the city is on fire, Katie. We have to go. - I think the bomb was nuclear. We need to get inside. We need to tape up the windows. The radiation from the fallout, we'll die. - Katie! - Antonio's gonna die. - Katie. - There's no stopping it. Katie. We need to tape up the window, like you said, okay. We probably should light some candles. You have anything, any duct tape? - I wanna go home. - You are home. - No, I'm not. This is not home. - We need to, we need to get, we need to get the tape up. - I don't know if that's even gonna work. - Come here. - Stop! Just leave me alone. We're gonna get really sick. The radiation- - You don't, you don't know that. - Yeah, I do. - Would you just trust me? For God's sake, just trust me. I trusted you. I'm tryin' to keep us focused. Yeah , yeah, like you're any good at that. - Okay, okay, what do you wanna do, because I said that we should leave, and you said no? Is this, is this gonna help us at all? Is it gonna buy us any more time? What do we need to do, Katie? - We need to stay inside. - Okay, and then what? What, what, what, what is gonna buy us more time? - Um, uh, potassium iodide. That's, that's the only thing that- - Okay, what is potassium iodide? - It's a pill for thyroid conditions. It's the only thing that counteracts radiation poisoning, slightly. - Okay, okay, do we know anyone in the building that had a thyroid problem? - No, I don't know. - There's a pharmacy, right down the street. - No, you- - Well, there's got to be a way to do that. - You can't go out. James, I don't... - Okay, okay, so what? What, we just give up? You just wanna give up? This reminds me of the hurricanes, back home. The power would go out. The storm would just be raging, outside. This one tornado came right over our house. And I remember running into the closet, to try and get cover. It's one of those, one of those times you're thinkin', yeah, this could be it. I could die. But somehow, I knew. I knew I was gonna live. - How? - How what? - How did you know you were gonna live? Oh. My dad. He told me I could do anything. Told me I could overcome anything. - 48 hours. What? - 48 hours until FEMA and the National Guard come. - How, how could you know that? What? How'd you know that? - The town in Oklahoma where my grandmother lived got hit by a tornado, and it took them 48 hours for them to come, and she complained about it for months. Our parents probably think we're dead. - They'll be pleasantly surprised. - Hey, who do you think shot first? - Well, Han, obviously. - This isn't a joke? - I don't know. Why does that matter? - It matters because people are dead, and our friend, our best friends are probably dead. - If they're dead, they're dead. I don't know. We have to figure out how we're gonna live. - I don't know why I even tried to talk to you. - Babe. - Don't call me that. See, that is exactly why we got divorced. It's because you never listen to me. - Well, maybe if you'd learn to talk things through- - Oh, and I'm the one that needs to work on that? - Yeah. - Do we want to talk about you and your gambling and your hiding it? - I don't do that anymore. - Yeah, but it's something that you did. - Oh, like Kyle? Is that what you did? - Don't even bring his name up. What, what do you mean don't bring his, what? - You're such an asshole. - Oh, I'm, yeah, I'm an asshole, right. I'm always the asshole. - Where are you going? - I'm, I'm gambling. - What, I don't even know what that means. - I'm gonna go find potassium whatever... Blow out, blow out the candle, blow out the candle. - We need to hide. Now. Shh. He took the computer. - We're not gonna survive here. - Well, what do you want to do, Katie, because there's radiation outside, there's looters inside? You said it, that this is the safest place for us to be. 48 hours, that's what you said, 48 hours. - Yeah, I know I said, I think we need... - Money, now. - That's all I have, I promise. - Get up against the wall, up against the wall, hands on your head. Follow me, and I'll kill you. - The radiation'll kill you, if it's not already. I wouldn't leave. That's a good one. - Yeah, you have a migraine, don't you? - Oh got a psychic over here. - If you take our food, we'll die. - Oh, you're a funny guy. - No, I'm just trying to tell you that- All right, all right, do what you need to do, man. - Y'all have a nice night. Get off him. - Get off! - Off the floor. Gimme something to tie him up with. Hurry up! - I think I'm gonna puke. - Don't do that. - I think I'm- - Shut up! Hurry up! Hold the gun on him. Come on, come on. Get off me! You know, you look too pretty to know how to tie a knot. - Hey, don't say another word, don't say another word. Do you understand me? - Hey, hey! - Do you understand me? - Hey, James, gimme the gun. Hey, gimme the gun. Gimme the gun. Gimme the gun, all right? It's okay. - Keep it on him. Come on, get up! James, James, wait! James. Hey! What are you, you're just gonna keep him in there? - Well, can he contaminate us? - Theoretically, yes. - Okay, then yeah, he's stayin' in there. - Let me outta here! Hey! - Well, where are you going? - I'm goin' to find this potassium iodide, whatever it's called. - No, no. - Yes. - No. - Yes, we have to find it. - No, I know we have to find it, but you stay here. You watch him, and I'll go. - No, I need you to stay safe. Well, that's why I've got this. Let me outta here. - All right, you go. - Okay. - Hey! Be safe. Hello? Open the door! - Oh shit! Shit. Fuck. - You know, that girl is pretty. - Shut up. - I was just- - You were, yeah, you were shutting up. - She reminds me of my wife. She was pretty, too. She's probably, um, probably dead now. - I'm sorry. She was crazy, man. I haven't seen her in, 10 years? - Why not? - Prison. You're an inmate? - Yeah, we got married at, uh, 18. Stupid. And I served seven years. I got busted for cocaine, last year, so I spent another 15. But the blast blew away half the prison, man. Some of the old boys got caught in the rubble, but the good Lord, He was lookin' out for me. Oh yeah, right place, right time. - Where'd you get the jacket? - Not too bright, are ya? You think your spot was the first of the night? - Right. - Am I really dyin'? - She says you are. - I deserve this. I deserve to die, right here. - We all make mistakes. - Yeah. But a lot of times, they're choices. - We make choices, but there's forgiveness. - Oh! Oh don't tell me you're one of them. - I didn't bring up God, man. You did. - Ain't no forgiveness for me, man. - I've been forgiven. - Yeah, yeah, for what? How 'bout you forgive me, and let me out of here, man? Come on, I wasn't gonna hurt you, man, I promise. You already got my gun, man. What else is- - There's plenty. Anything? - No. How is he? - Oh, he's asleep. You hungry at all? We should probably eat the stuff in the fridge, before it goes bad. - I only got stuff in the freezer. - Mm. - Thought you hated apple pie. - Freezer burn, it's really... - So what's his story? - His name's Artemis. I don't know. He looks bad. - We should give him some food, and I should look at his wounds. - We don't have enough food. - I don't think he's as bad as he wants us to think he is. - Are you kidding me? He had us at gunpoint. - Yeah, exactly, and he could've shot us, right there, and he didn't. - What? - I'm just saying, I don't think that we should give up on him. - You don't want to give up on him? - That's not what I was, James. - What? - Just, we have to stay focused, right? - You need to trust me, okay. This guy is unpredictable. - And I need you to trust me, when I say that I can handle him. Just get some rest. I'll watch him. - No, you rest. I'll watch him. How ya doin'? - Howdy. - Hey, I'm a nurse. - Congratulations. So, Miss Nurse, you gonna let me outta here? - Yeah, nice try. - You're boyfriend over there- - He's not my boyfriend. - Well, who the hell is he? - I'd really rather not talk about that. Pissy much? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, please. - Listen, I'm sorry. - Don't leave me here. Don't leave me. Listen, listen, listen, I'm sure we can work something out. Yeah, maybe tomorrow. - Hey, hey. Why you talking to me? - I don't know. I guess I just wanted somebody to talk to. - You got him. - Yeah. Yeah, he is, uh, he is really hard to talk to. Ain't that the truth? - Hey, so much for keepin' guard. - How long was I out for? - Just two, three hours. - You sleep at all? - Nope. - How's he? - He's sick. He's really sick. Okay. - Thanks for takin' me out of the bathroom. - You're welcome. - So how are you two related? - We're divorced. - Only through marriage. - Is that so? How long? - What divorced or married? - I'll take marriage for 200. - What is five years? - Not bad. Not bad. So what happened? - Hey, man, why don't you stop asking all the questions, or I can just put you back in the bathroom? - Why don't you just let me go, man? - Well, 'cause you'll die. - I'm dyin now. What's it to ya? Right. - There has to be something we can do. - It's only been 24 hours. - Okay, okay. What do we do if we they don't show up tomorrow? - I don't know. I mean, we could try to leave. Where would we go? And we don't have a car, so- - Let's try to look for the medicine again. - No, it probably wouldn't even help at this point. - You know, I'm sorry you never liked it here. - I did like it here. It was, I just, I just missed home. - That's the whole point, Katie. You were supposed to make this your home, here with me. - I did! I tried to! - But you gave up. - You act like I'm the one who wanted the divorce. You're the one who walked out the second that I called you on your bullshit. - Yeah, that's our greatest achievement Katie, is gettin' a divorce, 'cause we finally agreed on something. - You know, could you just do one thing for me, if you make it out of here, somehow, and I don't, could you just make sure to file the paperwork, 'cause I want it on record that we're divorced. - Whatever you say, babe. - Jesus Christ. Artemis! - Artemis! - Hey there, Miss Lady. Don't call me that. I'm starting to like you more, hoss. - Just drink it. - Hey, not too fast, okay? How much pain are you in? - No pain, no gain, right? Just, just let me go. No. - You're runnin' out of food, man. Why do you want to keep me? - I don't trust you. - Look at me, man. - Just do it. Just know that if you go back outside, you will die. - I'm dying now. - The best chance you have at survival is staying here, staying inside. The rescue teams- - Will take me back to prison. Hey, it's a willin', it's a risk I'm willin' to take out there. - Hey, just make sure you get under shelter, okay? - What's gonna happen is gonna happen. We choose how we deal with it. - If you come back, make yourself known. We might shoot you. - You won't shoot me. You love me too much. - Hey. Take it. - Thanks. Good luck. - No one's coming. - This could be everywhere. Every major city in the U.S. could be gone. - Maybe. - And we don't know if we retaliated. We don't know if the whole world is involved. - And here we are. Is there anywhere else we can look for the medicine? - No. I searched the entire building. What are you doing? - I was praying. - You never did that when we were married. - I didn't know how to. - Yeah, I mean, I remember a guy who didn't want anything to do with religion. - I still don't. I just want to make it through this. - And you think that's gonna help? Oh, Jesus Christ. - Yeah, exactly. When did you start? - About, about two months after we separated. Doin' any good? - I'm still doin' it, aren't I? - You're such a jerk. - I know. I know. - Well, hey, you let me know if, you know, you hear anything. - Yeah, I'll keep you posted. - What are you thinkin' about? - Nothin'. - Will you just, like, talk to me? About what? - I don't know. Anything, I don't care. How's the band? Not good. We hadn't been able to get a show in a couple of months. - Sorry. - Wrote a couple of good songs, recently, though, so... That's good. - Yeah. Yeah. - How's, uh, how's everything with your dad? - Oh, that's not good. Is he still, uh, seein' Karen? - Yeah, she is, she is such a spaz. Hey, what do you think your dad would say if he were here? - He would say, hold on. - Get the gun. Wait, what if it's somebody that needs help? - We cannot take that chance. - We have to, if someone's out there that needs help. - What if you're wrong? - Then at least we tried. Okay, okay. I'll get the door. - No, no. - You guard me. - Artemis? Get him up, come on. - There's not much we can do for him. - You can't bandage his wounds? - No, they're not the problem. - Janice, I'm so sorry. - Okay. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - I was supposed to hurry, Janice. I left you. I left you for such a long time. - It's okay. It's okay. - I'm gonna be sick. Are you okay? - Yeah. - You should come lay down. Get some rest. Have you seen anyone since we separated? - Katie- - We have to keep talking. We're just gonna go crazy if we don't. - I've seen one or two people. - Really? Yeah. - And? - And what? - What happened? - Nothing. - Really? - Yeah. - Will you tell me the truth? - About what? - About that night. Did you sleep with her? - I wanted to. - Why didn't you? - I don't know. - Did you? - Did I what? - Did you sleep with him? I think I'm gonna be sick. - Come on, let's get you to bed. James. Did he have anybody? - A wife. - Janice. - I guess. Said he hadn't seen her in a couple of years. You were right about him, you know. He wasn't so bad. I'm on fire. - I've been coughing up blood. You know what I was thinking about this morning? If somehow I live through this, I won't be able to have children. - Do you still want a little boy? - It doesn't matter anymore. - I still want a boy. - Do you still think you're gonna be able to survive this, you know, like your dad used to tell you? God, I wish my dad had been as inspiring as yours. All he ever taught me was how to run. That was the way to survive. He ran from my mom. I ran from you. - Katie. - But this time, I screwed up. I stayed put. We should've run, like Antonio did. - You know that wouldn't have worked. - And this is, just sitting here, waiting to die, just holding on to our delusions of getting rescued? - Let's go. Go where and do what? - You're not like your dad, Katie. You're brave. - I'm not as brave as you are. - You're not as stupid, either. - Well, that's true. If none of this would've happened, what do you think we would've done? - I think you would've moved back to Kenosha like you planned. What would you want to happen? - Oh, vacation in Hawaii sounds pretty good. - Oh God, make that two tickets. - Who said you were invited? - Oh, Jesus, help. - My mom, my sister, I wonder if, I wonder if Kenosha still even exists. - I'm sure it does. I mean, who wants to bomb Kenosha, Wisconsin? - Oh, I shouldn't be laughing at this. I wasn't the best wife, was I? Katie. - It's just things, things got so overwhelming. - I'm the one. I'm the one who messed up. I ragged on you about not communicating, but I'm the one who had the problem. I didn't talk to you about it. I just... I thought I could make it work, you know, with the band, and I thought I could get us to where we needed to be. - I wanted to be with other men. You can't take all the blame. And it was never sexual. It never went that far. I just needed something, and we couldn't figure it out. - We gave up. - Yeah. - You wanna do something? - What do you mean? - I don't know. Drink, sing, dance, I don't care. Anything but just sit here and wait. Damn. What are you doing? - It's just gonna get more painful. - Katie. Katie. We can't. - We're gonna die on this bathroom floor, and I can't do that. - Katie. We can't do that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that we're here. You're gonna have to do it. I can't. - Here lie James and Katie Shaw. If we are ever found, please tell any surviving family that we love them, and we took our own lives in order to spare the pain of a slow and agonizing death. We've tried our best to survive, but we can't overcome. I hope you can understand. Pray, pray for me. - I did. I love you. - I'm, I'm so, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! I love you, too. - You're, you're a terrible shot. Katie. Katie. Katie, do you hear it? Katie? Do you hear it? Katie, get up. Katie, get up, they're here. Katie, come on, they're here. Katie, get up. Katie, Katie? Katie, get up. Katie. Katie, Katie.
