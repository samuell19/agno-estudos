(claps) (eerie music) (chattering) (scraping) (eerie music) (engine rumbling) (eerie music) (coyote howling) (rustling) (ominous music) (rustling) (dog barking) - Settle down Palo. (dog barking) (ominous music) (ominous chord) (cries out) (whacks) (thunder cracking) (ominous music) - Where have you been? Aranjo? What the matter with you? I said where have you been? - I'm not your child woman. - [Woman] I spoke with Vincent's wife today. Said he got work in the city. She said maybe-- - I'm not interested. - We live like beggars while you wait for some fool to seek out Aranjo and his medicine. - Enough! You Lena and the others, all of you, you will learn to hold your tongue soon enough. I will have the power and everything will be as before. - Then that's all we need isn't it? I can put your chants and your spells over the fire, mix them with you power and serve them at the table. - Can you understand nothing? You stupid old woman! (thunder cracking) Look, look Lena. Then you understand this. Of course not but I do and that's all that matters. This is the source, this is the power passing over 100 years from the hand of the Nahalla into mine and soon woman Nahalla himself will stand at my side. - Nahalla? (scoffs) Crazy! That's what you are, crazy! - Wait woman. Wait and see! (thunder cracking) (ominous music) (rustling) (ominous music) (ominous music) (whisperings) (ominous music) (fizzling) (whispering) (door creaks) - What are you doing? It's late. Aranjo? Aranjo? (ominous chord) (screaming) - Lena? Lena? (ominous music) (snarling) Lena? (dog snarling) (screaming) - [Woman] Morning Carol. - Hello. - Hello. - Morning. - Professor Robert called twice already. - Gene Webber? Not before I've had some coffee. I'll get it. - Oh, one of the TV stations called and they will be here this afternoon for an interview. - That didn't take long did it? - Well I guess our friend in the vault is making a big hit with the media. - [Carol] Don't forget your 9:45. - 9:45 what? - With Dean Bell remember? And you have a meeting with the tribal elders at the excavation at 2:30. - Right. Listen Tom Eagle's going out there with me better give him a call around noon to remind him. - [Carol] Okay. - Oh, Paul before we get swamped with interviews make out a release and a fact sheet for the press not to technical but make it informative. Carol will type it up for you. - Okay, I'll have it later this morning. - Paul make sure the vault stays locked, no one's allowed inside without you or me. - Okay. - I've gotta get going. Carol, tell Webber I'll get back to him after my 8:40, please. - This is gonna be one of those days. - Good morning. Well we're only missing the usual's so we may as well get started. Now I believe we left off with the emergence of the ghost dance cult. As the 1880's drew to a close almost all of the western tribes shared a crushing sense of hopelessness and once again the white man's government wanted to reduce their reservations even further. So they were ripe for a messiah and that messiah was Wovoka. He started preaching a strange mixture of Christianity and the old Indian beliefs called the Ghost Dance Religion. Among other claims Wovoka swore that he had actually visited God in heaven. - Oh that gorgeous Rick Haley called said he was gonna be here at about 5:30. - Gorgeous who? - You know Rick Haley, the photographer from Geographic. - Oh no you mean the guy who was in here last month with the little cigars and the tight pants? - Mmhmm. - Well do me a favor, you handle it. - With pleasure, I think he's a doll. Did you know that Rick does a lot of stuff for fashion magazines? - You mean like whips and chains monthly? - And for you information, he said I have a very classic look. - Classic is not the word. - And he says he really wants to do something with me. - I'm sure he would. - God Paul, you're always so cynical about people you don't even know. Why don't you go play with your mummy. (phone ringing) - Anthropology. Hiya Ben, what's up? Oh brother, what did they get? - I haven't got a complete list yet but the grave sites pretty well cleaned out. - [Paul] What the hell are we paying that guard for? - Don't ask me, we can't even find him. Last time he was gone for two days you know that. - Yeah probably sleeping it off under a cactus somewhere. Alright look, call me back as soon as you know exactly what's missing. Yeah, yeah, talk to you later. (phone clatters) Damn it. - On page 215 in your text you'll find a depiction of the Ghost Dance ritual. The crude muslin shirt worn by the dancers were the sacred ghost shirt. This shirt was believed to protect the wearer against the white man's bullets. You'll see a number of similarities in some of the tribal rituals we've already seen. Isn't that right Phalan? I said isn't that right Phalan? - Huh? Uh sure, definitely. (laughs) - I'm afraid even the Ghost Dance couldn't bring you back to life Phalan. (laughing) It's important to remember that for the Indians the Ghost Dance cult presented a marvelous new world in graphic detail, a world inhabited only by Indians in which the buffalo would darken the land once again and in fact, previous generations of Indians would come back to walk the earth. (wind whistling) (eerie music) (ominous music) - [Ben] Watch it! Watch it! (ominous music) (crying out) (thuds) (crying out) - [Paul] Kay Montalos just called with some bad news. - [Kay] Oh please not today. - [Paul] Some more things disappeared last night. - What? - And that's not all, there's been an accident with one of the workers. - Well what happened? - He got pinned underneath a flat bed somehow. - Oh no, is he gonna be alright? - They don't know yet but his legs are pretty bad and Montalos figures you should get out there right away. - Well yes of course. If I can just get out there before the elders find out-- - It's too late for that, the elders probably know more about it than we do right now. - Well how could they find out already? - They had to take him to the infirmary on the reservation. - Oh Paul. - And they're on their way out to the site to meet with them now. - Alright listen, you're gonna have to cover my classes for me, tell Carol to cancel with Dean Bell immediately with apologies, I'm gonna go over and get Tom, I'll check in with you later. - Okay. - This thing's getting out of hand Kay. - Alright I'll handle it. Mr. Basowaya, you know Tom Eagle. - This is no time for pleasantries. We told you from the start that this would bring nothing but trouble. - Yes but you did give us your permission. - Some of us did Doctor, but not all of us. - Can you not understand what you have brought upon yourselves and on us if this is the resting place? - If this is the resting place-- - The Nahalla doctor. This is the resting place of Nahalla. The body that you found lying in the box, it was face down isn't that true? - Yes. - And was this not the way to insure the dead one could never revenge himself on others in the next life? - You really believe all that don't you? - Eagle, you of all people should understand. - Perhaps you have forgotten what the old man taught you. - You believe whatever you want. - Tom. - Enough has been said here. Doctor. But I tell you this, the man who was hurt was only the beginning, stop this work now! - Well you were a big help. I felt like a real heel standing down there-- - Look you can listen to all that nonsense if you want but don't ask me to. - Okay, okay. All I wanna know is do you know who this Nahalla is? - Kay he is just a crazy legend. - Well you might think it's crazy but you could at least have some respect for their feelings. - That's easy for you to say Kay you learned all about the Indians in a nice, air conditioned classroom, I lived it! I worked damn hard to free myself of these fairy tales and there's no way I am going to be dragged back into it. - I'm sorry. I just didn't realize how you felt. I wouldn't have asked you to come up here with me if I had. I'm sorry, I'm just a bit touchy. - It'll be alright. - But what was that business all about? You of all people should understand, what was that? - Oh who knows Kay. When you're out on that reservation that supernatural nonsense is about all you have left. (sighs) (creaking) (moaning) (banging) - [Woman] Oh my God. What if Dr. Foster is here. - [Man] You're sitting on my pants. - Paul? - Oh Paul. - You shut up. Give me my shoe Dr. Foster is that you? Ah, Rick, Mr. Haley and I-- - [Rick] Mr. Haley? I'm Mr. Haley. I wasn't Mr. Haley a minute ago. - [Carol] Oh it could be my job. Well maybe she has a sense of humor. (eerie music) (ominous music) (screaming) Get... (ominous music) (choking) (crying out) (ominous music) - Hey come on you know I love you but let's get outta here alright? Hey Carol? Come on Carol let's not play games, let's go. (ominous chord) (slashes) (crying out) (glass shattering) (ominous chord) (crying out) (screaming) (eerie music) - [Woman] Here kitty. Here kitty. - Senor Ocacio? - [Woman] Here kitty. (door snaps) (gasps) - I suppose you've already heard. About the digging place I mean. There's much talk in the village. - Now is much talk there and little else. - From some of the elders there's even talk of Nahalla. The people are afraid. Some want to come to you but others warn them to stay away. Some of them tell their children to stay away from me. Will you need me in the morning? - Yes child of the Crow, in the morning. (sirens blaring) - Kay why don't you on, I'll lock up. - No it's alright. I have to wait for Tom anyway, he's picking me up. Paul what do you think... What do you think our chances are of getting a solid history on that body? - It shouldn't be much of a problem. We know that area very well. I could probably develop a damn good profile on him I mean considering the artifacts that we-- - No that's not what I'm asking you. Is there even a remote possibility that we might come up with a personal background? - Oh you mean actually identify that specific body. Kay it's, it's possible, I mean it's... It's very unlikely you know but anything's possible. - Look Paul, you and I both know that the tribal council has been terribly upset about this project right from the top right? - Alright, now you're trying to suggest that there's something connected with what the council and what happened here? - It's occurred to me. Look but I don't think we should even think about that right now. Paul, some of the elders, unfortunately it's some of the more vocal ones, believe that what we have in there is the body of somebody called Nahalla and whoever it is they're scared to death of him. I have to tell you I didn't do very much for my scholarly pride to admit I've never even heard the name before. - So, neither have I, but we both know that every group has a whole category of dark legends and this is just one more. - Maybe. But if we can actually identify that body we can put the whole thing to rest. - Yeah, and then what if it is your Nahalla in there. - I know. Well in that case, we've got a problem. One big problem. (ominous music) (kissing) - [Tom] You want anything? - [Kay] No, no thanks, you go ahead. - Where'd you put the coffee? - It's on the stove. (scraping) (ominous music) - [Tom] Kay. - What? I'm sorry, I'm... What? - Are you alright? Sure you don't want any? - Hmm? Oh um, yeah, yeah. (clattering) - Is there any reason why Paul can't handle things tomorrow? You need to get away from there Kay. For a little while at least. Maybe we could both get away for a few days. (ominous music) What do you think? (ominous music) Paul can take care of the work for one day right? - What? Oh, sure. I mean no I've got too much to do. I'm alright, really. We'll talk tomorrow alright? I just, I just gotta get some sleep. - Okay, tomorrow. Lock everything up tight. (kisses) (door creaks) (ominous music) (door creaks) (ominous music) (water splashing) (ominous music) (scraping) (ominous music) - No they weren't play things. Kachina dolls were considered very sacred. The medicine men used them in mystical and religious rituals. They would often bury their dead with the dolls, in fact, they believed that the spirit of the dead person entered the doll. This is an excellent collection of kachina dolls. And this little fearsome creature with the blood stained knife is Soyah Wuhti or the monster woman. If you have any other questions please feel free to ask any of the staff, okay thank you. Kay. - Hi Paul. - How you feeling? You look beat. - I couldn't sleep, you know. - I know. Listen, I may have found something. Do you remember the private collection that came in last semester? - What, the one from the Lyndon Foundation? - That's it. I found an old diary in there that belonged to a guard at the Territorial Prison. And there's some references to a real hell raiser from the Saint Andrew group. Every time the guy referred to him he call him Nathan Hall, Indian. You know how they used to give the Indian prisoners Christian names. - Nat Hall, Nahalla. - Look it's a long shot but who knows. - Look was there anything about what area he came from? - No, not a thing but there's a lot of material I haven't even covered yet. - Okay, well look, let me know if anything else turns up okay? - Sure. Listen, when are we gonna get time to unwrap our friend? - I'd like to wait for the x ray before we touch a thing. - Well they should be back this morning. - [Kay] Good. (door bangs) (ominous music) (whispering) (whispering) (throat clears) (whispering) (door bangs) (gasps) - Oh for goodness sakes Paul. - Sorry. - It's alright. - They just sent over the x rays. - Well, why don't you give me a few minutes and we'll get started okay? - Okay. (door bangs) - [Kay] Paul? Paul. - What is that? - I'm not sure. - A tumor maybe. - Alright. We'll go over these tomorrow with the radiologist. What do you wanna do? Do you wanna quit or shall we open it up? - Let's do it. - Oh great, a man after my own heart. (ominous music) Alright, let's stop here or we'll both be at it all night. (gloves snapping) Why don't you get ahead and pull that outer covering back on and lock up. I'll give Tom a call before we leave. - Okay. - I am getting out of here. Alright Tom, maybe you're right. Wherever, sure, fine, mmhmm. No, no, no, it'd be crazy to come all the way back here, I'll meet you there. Okay, fine, bye bye. (phone clatters) Tom wants to go to dinner. You wanna come along? - No, no thanks. I gotta a whole mountain of term papers to... Oh, before you go, I found some more references to your Nahalla in an old BIA journal. And it seems that at the time of the Ghost Dance Nahalla was a renegade who couldn't accept the dream of peace with the whites. So he practiced his own brand of religion. Ritual murders, burnings, torture. - And he was from this area? - Came here in 1894 for kidnapping a white woman and making her his wife. But she seems to have fallen under his spell because she joined his cult and they became a murderous team. - Holy Jesus. - Yeah but that's not all. The woman's sister spent months trying to track them down, trying to convince her to leave him and go back with her and they tortured her for days before they killed her. - Oh come on, her own sister? - Yeah, nice couple huh? Anyway there's a cross reference to Colby's Indian Compendium but I haven't gotten that far yet. - Well we've got a Colby's around here somewhere. - Kay, do yourself a favor and let me handle it. You're tired, go to dinner and try to relax. I promise you I'll call you as soon as I hear anything. - Can I trust you? - Scout's honor. - I don't know how I'm supposed to relax after what you've just told me but I'll try. I've gotta get going. - Alright well I'll walk you to your car. - [Kay] What for? (chattering) (door bangs) (engine rumbling) (eerie music) (whispering) (eerie music) (ominous music) (tires squealing) (ominous music) (ominous music) (gasping) (ominous music) (tires squealing) (crashing) (crying) (screaming) - [Man] Take it easy lady. (crying out) Calm down now. - Where did you come from? - [Man] I think you'd better step back to the patrol car. - No, no a little fuller. - How's that? - Oh yes, that's it. - Thanks Bob for coming in. Goodnight. - [Bob] Goodnight. - Well? - I'll be honest with you. You're right. I have no intention of wasting my time looking for some mystery man out in the desert but if there are some people who are resentful enough of your excavation there's a good chance that one of them has decided to do something about it. You would be amazed at what people will do doctor, with or without a full moon. - Lieutenant I think I understand your position quite well. And I can't blame you if you just can't accept this as a serious occurrence that's-- - Now just a minute. Nobody is taking this lightly, most of all not me. We're talking about murder here doctor, two to be exact and there's nothing supernatural about that. Richard! Would you make a copy of this for the lady please? - [Richard] Yup. - Thank you. (phone ringing) Hello? Good. Thank you. Mr. Eagle is down in the lobby, he'll wait for you there. - Did they tell you what happened? - [Tom] Yes I think that-- - [Kay] You think I'm crazy. - [Tom] Of course not. I just think you're very tired that's all. - Tom. I was afraid to tell the lieutenant, he already thinks I'm out of my mind. (paper crinkles) This face, the man who followed me, it's the face of the body we found. (paper crinkles) - Listen to me honey, you've been under a terrific strain, out in the desert at night your mind can turn summersaults and whatever you see or hear can seem very real. - I'm telling you he was there. - Sure he was there and it doesn't matter if he was actually there or not because either way he was really enough to almost get you killed. - Tom please, if you do know something about all this, you and the old man, I don't even care anymore please, don't keep it from me. (crying) What's happening to us? I've never been so frightened. - Oh my God. (sighs) - [Recording] This is Dr. Foster. - Oh shit. - [Recording] I'm not in at the moment so please leave your message when you hear the tone and I'll get back to you as soon as I can, thank you. (beeps) - Kay, this is Paul. I don't care how late it is please give me a call as soon as you get back. There's something... Well there's something very strange happening here. The woman that Nahall kidnapped was a Melissa Stewart, and there's a damn good picture of her in Colby's Compendium and this uh, it's absolutely crazy but (beeps). Oh Jesus. (phone bangs) (door bangs) (ominous music) (clicks) (ominous music) No, no! (ominous music) (crying out) (clicks) - Special collections please. Yes, this is Dr. Foster in Anthropology. Would you check a title for me please? It's Colby's South West Indian Compendium 1911. (ominous music) Would you excuse us? Now please. - Lib give us a minute please. Kay what is the matter with-- (dramatic music) - Tom please, help me. - And even those who do not believe a word of it would just as soon have nothing to do with him. The man is, oh I don't know, strange. - Alright I understand that but can he help us? - There are some people who think this Ocacio is a sorcerer. (eerie music) (knocking) (dramatic chord) Ocacio. My name is Thomas Eagle, we come to speak to you about the trouble in the city. Many things have happened which the men in the city cannot understand and now, the name Nahalla is spoken. - They cannot understand themselves. How can they understand what goes on around? And they speak of Nahalla. Why? To run from their own shadows like frightened children? Just as you did. - Ocacio, I only ask that you speak with us, that's all. The woman is from the university, she thinks she has seen Nahalla. But a police lieutenant says that this all the work of someone who is trying to fool us. - Has this police lieutenant found such a person? - No. - Then let him believe what he wishes. He is content. - Ocacio, couldn't you just explain-- - This is not a school and I am not a teacher. First, I must see your excavation. - When? - When do you wish to be free of your troubles? - We could be here in the morning. - When is your morning? - At what time? - Whenever you want. - My morning is the gray before the sun, first light. - We'll be here, first light. (ominous music) I'll just be a minute Tom. (pounding) Would you see who that is please? (pounding) - [Tom] Sure. - Oh hi, I... - Sorry, the museum's closed. - Oh I know, I'm really here to see Paul Michaels. - You wanna leave a message? - Well Paul let me borrow this, but he said if I didn't get it back to him today-- - Look give it to me, I'll put it on his desk, call him first thing in the morning and tell him you really brought it back tonight okay? - Wow that'd be super. (door clicks) - Oh help me Tom won't you? - [Tom] Yes I will. - [Woman] Thanks. Thanks a lot. - [Tom] You're welcome. Hey wait a minute. - Yeah? - Do me a favor, I'm locked out. Could you please call the security guard and tell him to let me in? - Yeah sure, right away. - [Tom] Thank you. (rattling) (ominous music) (ominous chord) (crying out) (ominous music) (screaming) (ominous music) - [Kay] Tom! (ominous music) - [Recording] This exhibit represents only a small portion of the bird life native to the Sonoran desert which stretches from northern Mexico through southern Arizona. Listen carefully for the distinct call of each bird. (birds chirping) (ominous music) (screaming) (ominous music) (ominous music) (crying out) (ominous music) (bangs) (cries out) (gasping) (ominous music) - Kay? I'm sorry I bothered you. - [Security] No problem sir, goodnight. - Goodnight. Kay? Kay are you alright? - Of course. No, don't. - What is the matter? - Nothing Tom, I'm just tired that's all. Why don't you just go on and I'll-- - Are you serious? I'm not going to leave you alone with... What is that? (cries out) (whacks) (ominous music) (rustling) (engine rumbling) (ominous music) (coyote howling) - Now Tom Eagle, now you must help. - [Tom] Just tell me what's happening and I'll do what you ask. - This much I can tell you, if you will do just as I say you will have your woman back but if not, she is forever lost. - I'll do as you say. - There is a house just beyond, inside there you must find a leather pouch, no bigger than your hand, when you have it return the pouch to the body and burn everything. If one is not cremated the soul will wander forever. Stop for no one above all the woman, as long as she with Nahalla she is (speaking foreign language) and she will take your life and put it in the basket for him.
