Please sign the papers now. - I don't agree Don't you agree Mrs Bouvier? - No. We're never going to settle this. The judicial decision has been made.. It's about your visitation rights. - How often? - Once a fortnight. - That's not much. Both of you are going to sign. Do you understand, Mrs Bouvier? - It's hard. I don't agree because I love my son with all my heart. It's my son Sheep. I brought him into the world. But you do understand. That you're not able to take care of your child. - Who do you think you are? I raised him until now. - He's better off without you. - If you hadn't fucked up.. We wouldn't be in this shit. You fat whore! - That's enough Mrs Bouvier. The decision has been made.. We're talking about your visitation rights,okay? - No,I'm not okay. I do love my son you do understand,right? Of course I do..

I didn't do anything. You can eat chocolate fingers! - No. - You don't wanna eat? - You think I'm eating all the time? - I didn't say that! One button ,two buttons.. - You see?

If all goes well,it's a good one! - Louise! - Come on Tony! Show me a smile! - The two brothers together! - Show us your muscles! You don't wanna come? What's wrong? Hello Madam? This is Sheep. I'm calling to tell you a she-cat is dead. The white one. Are you okay? Bye. How huge it is! - It looks like my lubed cock,guys! Oh good job. Well done kids! You're all thumb! Hey guys, hello, it's me! Hello Audrey! - Hello. Hello! - Hello Audrey! Miss. You're a little ray of sunshine in the kitchen. - Thanks, that's nice of you. - Let's stay focused. Benjamin? Can you bring the white wine, please? - Bye. - Goodbye miss. You look happy, Sheep. - Yes, I'm happy today.. Don't know what's happening to me. Welcome to 'La Crmaillre'.. A room for Saturday? Of course. We'll see you on Saturday. Thank you. Goodbye. He's eaten.. - He just licked it. - Stop messing about now! - What's wrong with this kid? - I don't care! - Time flies.. One month until St. Anne's feast. - Soon? - Yes. What ever you want. - I wanna go to the fair. - We'll go afterwards, alright? Hey Louise! We saw you! I got a lover. - But with such breasts, such a backside. Such a fantastic body.. - This fantastic body isn't tor you. - You could even be hot. - I'm just hot for my lover. - You should try.. You could even enjoy it. - I don't think so. - With a body like yours.. You should try. Soup's on! Hey Tony,do you want some soup? Do I say:who wants some soup? - Who wants some soup? He turned back. He retraced his steps. The man chooses Sheep among all of them. He comes close to him, unlocks his chainsaw and plunges it into Sheep's arm.. It seem ed as if it were at random. It is said that dogs came out from nowhere.. Howling. Sheep's life was saved but he lost his arm. After leaving the hospital. He goes to stay at his uncle's in Picardy. We will see him again in a photo, with a dog on his lap.. And Louise will one day send him.. A short letter. I think about that moment. Over and over again. I can't sleep at night. I relive the horror every hour every minute. Your honor.. That night will keep on replaying inside my head. If I'm Judged guilty. I would prefer to be sentenced. To life imprisonment, your honor. It should even be the death penalty. If justice existed, your honor.. I would give my arm. I'm the one who started it.. Two arms,even. Two arms would be fair. Two arms would be fair. After deliberating. The court unanimously reached the decision. That the accused is guilty.. And that there are no.. And that there are no.. Extenuating circumstances. AS a consequence. The accused is found guilty.. And is sentenced to 10 years of prison. The court is adjourned. That's not fair! What your son did stinks! My son is better than any of you here anyway! Leave me alone. Fucking justice! How's he gonna work? He's handicapped for life now! And Louise will one day send him a short letter. She will announce her marriage to Mimi.. And the birth of their baby.. Will give news about Ben-J.. Whom she meets by chance at the bus station. All of this, and she knows it.. Will in fact be written for her own sake. She will end with a conventional phrase: I will never forget you. They live the rest of their life Be good, be kind.. Yes you are, my beautiful. I've finished. Go underneath. Then cut here. Does it disgust you? Don't you feel sick? - Uh, no. That's the way it is, one needs to eat. You see, it's easy. - Don't leave the fingers. - Well, no. So, what did you want, Madam? -A puff pastry. A cheese one. Anything else? That's 2.40 and 9.80. 9 plus 2 is 11. Goodbye. It went well.. You saw how to serve the ham? It's easy. Louise, choose anything you want. Don't worry about the price. Take what you want. Your boyfriend is here tonigh,enjoy! This. Goodbye. What's that? - Steak tartare. - I'm hungry. - Me too. Wait! Sorry to interrupt. I have something to say. My wife here, well.. - Wife-to-be.. - We're getting married. - Let's open the champagne! - So you're tying the knot. To the happy couple! - Congrats Mimi. - Nights out are over. You won't take him away from me.. He will be mine. - I need her for the wedding dress. - And the hairdresser. Organizing everything. He says that but he doesn't know when! - One year. - We have to organise everything. Of course you're invited! - They're already dressed up! - Was it so bad? - And the honeymoon? - Is it an offer? - Money,you know. - Louise, Venice? - Venice, it would be a dream! One step in the right direction. Mimi abandons a dog It's your fault! You're a pain in the arse! We're wasting time with your bullshit. Fucking rain! That takes the piss! Here,thank you! There's two of us,is that alright? - Like last time? - Is it 0k? - Shall I go first? She's sleeping. You would not? Of course not. Save me, Oh God, for the waters. Have ﬂooded my soul. I sink into the miry depths,the chasm.. There is no foothold. I have entered the waters of the abyss. The ﬂood engulfs me. They remember Sheep Hey young man.. What the hell? Go outside! What are you doing here? - Nothing. - Mum, he's smoking! Hello.. - Good evening ladies and gentlemen. - The paper and a bingo card.. - France Ouest and bingo card. - The paper and a bingo. My son feels miserable, you know.. Don't blame him. After what happened to Sheep. I should never have had that kid. - Come in! My brother! - Come on Tony, let's go. - Where am I bleeding. - Put out your cigarette! Louise! - Hey Ben-J! How are you? It's been ages. I'm pleased to see you. - How old is she? - Two months and a half. We got married and we had this little one. - She looks like Mimi. - The spitting image of him! What have you been up to? - Not much. - Really? It's the same old, same old. Mimi's still working at the kennel, meat the butcher's. Life goes on, right? You wanna hold her? - No, I'll drop her. - At this age, she's very small. Here is my bus. It's not very easy. See you later. By the way, did you hear from Sheep? I got no time to write to him.. We often think about him. - Say hello to Mimi. - I will. - Bye. We're on the bus? We're gonna see dad? Wanna a cuddle! Hi Sheep. At last I write you.. Let me announce the birth of Clara.. A sweet angel who messes around already. I'm still working at Sottiaux's butcher.. And Mimi at the kennel. Courseulles is still the same. And the weather is foul.. But at least we had a sunny wedding day. Ben-J says hello to you. Hope you're doing well at your uncle's. And that you enjoy Picardy. Your friend. Who will never forget you.
