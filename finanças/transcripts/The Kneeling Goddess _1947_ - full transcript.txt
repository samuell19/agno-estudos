THE KNEELING GODDESS - How many days now? - Why think about that? It would spoil the little time we have left. Is it little, then? This time it is. What I mean is time will be completely ours someday. Don't worry, Antonio, I understand. I never ask you anything. I've never wanted to ask you anything. That's a proof of our love. Never inquire about the mystery of the past, if we truly love our love. But it is so difficult to be strong in loneliness and we meet so seldom. Let us never abandon each other. It would be like dying. Then, let us shut our eyes... ...and live that dream. I will keep them closed so my soul doesn't escape from this dream. Kiss me again, Antonio. Mexicana Airlines announces the departure of flight 505 to Mexico City. Passengers, please board the aircraft. I can't help it, Antonio. Everything between us is so brief. Don't get impatient, I'll write. I'll be back on September 25th. Goodbye then. What? Are you moved? It's funny, you've become sentimental. A serious flaw in business. Don't tell me you're falling in love. Stop it. This is stronger than my will. Antonio is different from the rest. But don't worry, Nacho. We said that nothing could destroy our bond... ...except for ourselves. Don't blame me. I'm the one who is destroying it. Neither of us should have a past. True. But if you were ever to hear about mine, you'd know I don't deserve you. I don't want to go on deceiving you and I can't let you know the truth either. Forget me. Goodbye. Come in, José. Here is the letter. You shan't forget the instructions, shall you? Don't worry, Miss Raquel. As soon as that man comes, I'll deliver him the letter. - If he asks where you went...? - Tell him you don't know anything. - Good night, José. - Good night, miss. And believe me, I am going to miss you dearly. "So, ratifying our contract... ...we'd like you to send us your approval as soon as possible. Sincerely. Mexico City. September 25th". September 25th. This is the act from yesterday's council for your approval, sir. WEAR DESIRE LOVERS' PERFUME Let's leave it until I return from Guadalajara. Good day, sir. Everything is ready. - Here is your airplane ticket. - Thank you very much, Esteban. I almost forgot that you were coming. Look out the window across the street. Yes, sir. That sign they're putting up... a perfume. - "Desire"? - Yes, "Desire". Tell me, Esteban. What does desire mean to you? The word itself says it, sir. It is what one longs for, what one wants... That is, what one desires. Exactly. It's also a force that makes you, that drives you to get what you want... ...and to keep it if you already have it, right? Yes, sir. That force can grow, take on a shape, become free, greater than you. Then, it ends up destroying you. And, what's worse, destroying those close to you. Elena? - Yes? - I want to say goodbye. I have a surprise. I decided to put off my trip to Guadalajara. But, wasn't it urgent? It is no longer necessary. The matter I had to handle... ...I have solved definitively. Yes. I'll be right over. Goodbye. My talk about desire must have bewildered you. But there was a purpose to it. For a long time, I've gotten the feeling you desire... ...to take a vacation. Here. Sir, me... on a plane... I've never flown before in my life. Flying without an airplane would be dangerous. Miss, let's finish the dictation. Come at once. Wait for me outside. We'll go home together. Yes, sir. Antonio, I was so happy that you put off your trip. Now... Now, I am completely happy. Come. We're going to do many things together. We'll refurbish. We'll pretty up the house. - Yes, Elena. Anything you want. - Look, finish the fountain. It'll be ready long before our anniversary. - Don't you think it'll be beautiful? - Yes, very beautiful. But incomplete. What's the same as saying: "Not so beautiful". Something incomplete does not lack in beauty. There is Venus de Milo. True. And Schubert's Incomplete Symphony. Venus of Milo? That's it! You got it. That's what the fountain will need once it is finished. Something like the Venus, would be the best anniversary present for me. You're terrible. Really. Go to Demetrio's studio and pick out a nice sculpture. - Something in your taste. All right? - All right. The package of books you ordered from the library is in your laboratory. Doctor Vidaurri has arrived, madam. I will be right there. Elena. Have you been feeling ill again? It's nothing, darling. The usual treatment. I will call you as soon as the meal is ready. Raquel and I bade farewell with our usual secret inquietude. Would we meet again? Would that be the last time? Or, would there be others? Now I can answer those questions. After a terrible struggle, I defeated desire. Raquel... ...the woman who reincarnated it... ...has been banned from my life forever. The Kneeling Goddess. That's what Demetrio called her. Although she is really... ...a simple woman on her knees, just like all men like to see women. What are you doing here? Why are you talking that way? I warned you, you'd be disappointed when you saw the real me. You warned me? Antonio, fancy meeting you here! You've come to see her, haven't you? Look, isn't she fabulous? Her name is quite adequate. The Kneeling Goddess. The name, it's my masterpiece! Who told you that was its name? Mysterious voices in your studio explain it all. Look, such pureness in lines. Her torso is absolutely classic... ...the outline of her leg is the prettiest thing I've seen... ...and the whole form is the consummation... ...of the most perfect equilibrium. Difficult to surpass by anybody. - I've come to buy her from you. - Buy her? Naturally. I wouldn't have expected less from a connoisseur like you. It is a gift for Elena. Nothing more fitting. You are giving your wife immortality. That means that I am entitled to a part of it. How much does the whole immortality cost? Let's not discuss money now, it makes me nauseous. Tell me about her. So, you have fallen in love. That would be my greatest feat! I made her to inspire love. To bring about desire. You fulfill your mission. When I look at her I feel like I know her. As if a distant evocation had turned to marble. Exactly! That is how I felt in Rome when I saw the work of Michelangelo. When may I send for her? It's hard to say. She isn't finished, though she seems to be. - I'm a blasphemous. What is missing? - Everything. The last strike of the chisel. The one that will give her life. You'll have to wait a month, a year perhaps. If it's less than a century, let me know and send the receipt. Goodbye, Demetrio. She's ready! The receipt shall be ready tomorrow. - Does he usually buy statues? - What do you mean by "usually"? - Is it an addiction? - That's not what I meant. He seems like a strange fellow. No. Different. Of course, not at all like us. What about her? She's so fake and supernatural you could call her a true wife. - Somewhat insufferable, of course. - Quite the opposite, at least from him. He adores her. He sees through her eyes. Even when he looks at other women? He would never do such a thing. You'd be wasting your time. Could be. No, Antonio, this shows that we are trying to flee from each other. Don't blame me, Raquel. Sometimes what we do is determined... ...by dark, secret impulses. When I saw you today, my memories suddenly blended like an avalanche. Memories? What good are words? We have before us a reality greater than all words. We live in different worlds. That is our reality. But we have met again and we cannot deny what it means. Yes. Our madness was to imagine that we could live without the past. Don't take away my right to the one thing I've left. My own future. I'm not taking it from you. I want to be a part of it. Take me home, Antonio. We'd better say goodbye here. Goodbye. There is nothing worse than deceiving oneself. All my struggle was in vain. I understand that it is stronger than I. Madam shouldn't have come down. Don't worry, I feel well. Please reconsider, the effort is too large. I shall have to make larger efforts yet! Antonio! What are you doing here? You shouldn't have come down. The doctor forbade you to. I'm the one who should reprimand you. You haven't slept a wink. I... had to finish an analysis. Besides, that doesn't matter. You haven't been taking care of yourself, Elena. I should be taking care of you although it may seem like a contradiction. I get the feeling you're in grave danger, Antonio. It's your imagination. The only way nothing will happen to me... ...is knowing you are in good health. Rest assured, I am a lot stronger than you imagine. Nobody will tear me apart from you. Why do you say that? Women always feel a threat as it approaches. You are surrounded by ghosts and schemes that don't exist. Love is never deceived! I can see beyond your eyes, your sleepless nights and worries... I don't want you to be alone. I've decided not to return to the Rochester clinic. What? That is madness. - Don't play games with your health. - Our love's health is first! Stop insisting! You could truly compromise it If you stay. All right. I will return to the clinic after our anniversary. There is the risk that it may be the last. POISON Maybe I'll find a door out. A determination. The only one. Although it may be the most extreme and painful. I am like a man returning from a storm, Raquel. I wandered for hours and didn't even notice. Lonely and isolated, as if I were in a big, empty house. I would have liked to walk without stopping. Not interrupting an escape that suddenly seemed impossible. Then, I decided to return, do you understand? Taking your shadow with me was foolish for I couldn't get away from it. The image of you was everywhere. Alive and terrible to despair. You wanted it this way, Antonio. I tried to leave, but you united our fates again. Now you must have the courage for your truth. For the truth about both of us. Either you are mine or you destroy me. There is no middle ground. Because our love speaks another language. It says life to death. Fire to cold, and words to silence. You must understand this language with your own life. I too either am yours or destroy you. With no middle ground, either. And if we love each other there shall be no before or after. It shall be like the beginning of the world. I have the strength for that love. I swear. Decide within yourself. If you too have the strength... ...go back to your wife and tell her, for she will understand. Is that your condition? Yes. Now, go. I'll wait. No news, sir. Nobody knows where he is. But that's impossible. Keep looking, he has to be somewhere. I'll be expecting your call. Thank you. Come in. Her husband must know her condition. She has to stay in bed and may not leave her quarters under any circumstance. I'll be back after midnight. Antonio. It's me, madam. Have you any news? Where is he? He's coming, madam. He shan't be long. Naturally. He cannot be absent on our day. I have to get ready. Tell Maria to come up and help me. Madam, don't you think it would be wiser... ...to wait for him here, without such agitation? That's madness! Are you forgetting that this is our anniversary? It will be as always. The same friends, the same bliss. Go on, tell Maria to come. I'm sorry, Elena. You're home now. I don't want to hear anything. - Good evening. - How are you, Antonio? Is The Kneeling Goddess there? I waited for you in vain. I came only to know the reason of your determination. Is it lack of love or courage? You will understand if you allow me to explain. And if it isn't too late for an explanation. Time doesn't count between us. You know that. That's what's so terrible. I told you before, I will allow you no middle ground. There will be no before or after. You don't need an introduction. You immediately recognized her. The Kneeling Goddess. Demetrio insists on saying that nature copies art. It's not my quote, but it may as well be. Everything is ready, madam. Let us go to the dining room. MRS. ELENA G. DE ITUARTE DIED YESTERDAY THE FAMOUS MODEL RAQUEL SERRANO IS GOING TO MAKE ONE'S DEBUT AS A CABARET SINGER IN PANAMA I got married I got taken I have fallen in the trap Set by the woman In order to marry well, You've got to be smart You've got to be submissive For the catch But once you're married You've got to show your temper For by then we must Not care about our husband When you get married, Find yourself a wife That is elegant And very beautiful Because that way All your life You may have A lot of time to lose And now, gentlemen You can see for yourselves What happens to the man Who searched for a wife I don't know what love is I am ashamed to confess In my arms you will know Why I am a professor If I do not correspond Don't hold it against me My lovely little wife You have a crystal soul I knew love once. It is very beautiful. But for me it was brief and betraying. At first it was glorious, but later became despicable. Its law is pleasure... ...for money. Love For you, I drank My own tears Love You were my cross My religion Vengeance is fair And in the meantime Let us live Deceiving our hearts Love For you I drank My own tears Love You were my cross My religion Vengeance is fair And in the meantime Let us continue Deceiving our hearts Let us continue Deceiving our hearts To be happy And live without a care Don't let your heart speak out You will live your life Oblivious to pain Better to enjoy it, Better to laugh! - For you - For me - It must be. - The best Not to marry, Not to marry Because, I believe We will enjoy love more If we're not married, Not married I won't get married, If I did I would die Being single, That is what I prefer For you, for me, For everybody It is best to forget about love I won't get married, If I did I would die Being single, That is what I prefer For you, for me, for everybody, It is best to forget about love So, what are you? I am Panamanian Because through my veins runs Sensual blood So, what are you? I am Panamanian From that garden of dreams That is my Panama So, what are you? I am the owner Of the joy of my Panama Panama, tropical bliss Raquel! What's wrong? You are insufferable these days. The way that man drinks is intolerable. He hasn't been sober since he arrived. I think you've taken this affair much too far. You don't even know what his true intentions are. It seems strange he traveled thousands of miles only to get drunk. There's more than meets the eye. Don't complain, you've put it to good use. But if he stays here, he could get us into a mess. We should get a good indemnity out of him... ...and then send him off, in all courtesy, of course. It would be best... to send him off. What do you want? For everybody to drink up! To the last drop. Until there's nothing left. No middle ground. To extermination or to surrender. You know what I mean, don't you? Here. Go get a taxi. Go, what are you waiting for? Antonio, when will you tell me what brought you to Panama? Tell me. This man is mad. He meant to kill you. - We should hand him over to the police. - I know what's wrong with him. He will bring us trouble. The sooner we get away from him, the better. Your taxi is waiting, sir. Take him to the hotel. I'll talk to him tomorrow. Come in. It's me, Antonio. I came to say goodbye. Wait for me. I'll be right out. I brought you your lighter. You left it in the dressing room. How do you feel? I'm fine now, thank you. I must go, Antonio. Wait, we have to talk! I don't want to be late for rehearsal. I'll see you at the night club. Did you get the wire, sir? - What wire? - The one I took to your room. Oh, yes. Here. Figaro, Figaro, Figaro At last. What a mess! A woman wears so many clothes, and I had to fix your bags myself. I packed my stockings, my panties, I packed my girdle, I packed... So much... The ship leaves at five in the morning. Sky and sea to open destiny. To return to our free and pilgrim existence. Isn't this wonderful? "Goodbye... ...Panama". Nacho, I'm not going with you. What? You are joking. That's like throwing everything away. I have always lived doing that. We have always walked together. It was our only bond. - Wandering senselessly. Now, it's over. - What made you change so much? This. So, then it wasn't natural death, was it? Did you know his wife had died? Why did you hide it from me? I thought it was best for us both. From your perspective. Can you grasp the meaning of that wire? Yes. Her death under strange circumstances means many things. Do you mean to tell me that now...? I have come to understand Antonio truly loves me. I am not just a simple whim for him. Now that he is free he comes to me. He is free by his own hand. Listen to me. Antonio has killed for me. You are so easy to deceive by your own fabrications! You made up a triumphant and extraordinary world... ...where you are the goddess at whose feet all sacrifices are consummated. Don't be blinded by the idea that he killed for you. You don't know Antonio. He is capable of any extreme act. You won't always find a man who behaves as I do. Of course. Spite is blinding you. Am I to blame for not loving you? Maybe you're right. Raquel... ...today was the happiest day of my life. Try to understand, Nacho. I may just be assuming things, but I found this hidden in his lighter. Cyanide? There is enough poison here to kill a horse. Could it have been intended for you? I'm sorry. You may be right. It looks like Antonio poisoned her. Isn't this irrefutable proof? What do you think? You know? It isn't my own love that has me trapped anymore. I must have the strength to play out Antonio's fate... ...without fearing the consequences. Our passion made me his accomplice. Be warned! Our farewell number. To be happy and live Without a care Do not allow Your heart to speak You'll live your life And never suffer It is better to enjoy it, Better to laugh! - For you - For me - It must be - The best Not to marry, Not to marry I believe we will Enjoy love more If we're not married, Do not married I will not get married, If I did I would die Being single, That is what I prefer For you, for me, for us, It is best to forget about love - For you - For me - It must be - The best Not to marry, Not to marry I believe we will enjoy love better If we're not married, Not married I will not get married, If I did I would die Being single is what I prefer For you, for me, for us, It is best to forget about love I will not get married, If I did, I would die Being single is what I prefer. For you, for me, for us, It is best to forget about love Eleven thirty in my room. So, what are you? I am Panamanian Because through my veins runs Sensual blood - Shall I come and serve? - I will do it myself. - Happy New Year, sir. - Happy New Year. - Good evening, Antonio. - Good evening. Did I keep you waiting? I didn't mean to. Just enough time to make the kind of scenery you deserve. Didn't Demetrio use to say "The perfect frame for a work of art"? Demetrio... all that is so distant, isn't it? Yes, very distant. I think we have had to wander such strange roads just to get to the same point. Everything has been so strange. Also my presence here. Maybe. Why did you flee this morning? What were you afraid of? Of so many things. A happy fear I have not overcome. That doesn't answer my question. Why did you flee like that? I saw things differently. I submitted myself to the inevitable presence of your wife. But now that I know everything I have no reserves. If you were capable of killing for love I too feel capable of sharing your crime. Here. Now you shall have me completely in your hands. The fact is we are in each other's hands. I am also adrift. I too destroyed the rope behind me. Would you rather I read it to you? Everything depends on your attitude after I read it. You have to know what it says. It's the honest thing to do. It is presumed your wife didn't die of natural causes. Your lawyer seems to foresee some difficulties. I was scared to give it to you. I only opened it because it was from her. Such a difficult battle to win your heart over. God! We're overlooking the year is dying. The year has ended. To our listeners, all sorts of happy wishes. Joy and well being for the living and a memory full of gratitude... ...for who are no longer with us. Joy and well being for the living, Antonio. For us, the living. Thank you, sir. - Only unpack the things you need. - Are we leaving right away? We will be here as briefly as possible. I am so glad, Antonio! Now I believe in our new life. I have to leave you a few hours. I need to see my lawyer. The ticket agency will call to confirm the time of departure. We will fly to New York at dawn. New York, then to Europe. We will get married in Italy. I'll be right back. Sir, I was expecting you a lot earlier. - Did you have a good trip, sir? - Yes, Esteban. Thank you. Counselor Jiménez has called several times. What did you say? That Counselor Jiménez has been looking for you. You wanted to rest. I will arrange your bedroom immediately. Wait. It seems as if... ...nothing has changed since then. Who knows, sir. It seems things never change and they are always in their place. But they are not the same. They are lacking in warmth. They die, too. Whole months without lighting the fireplace. Everything has become dull and cold in this house, sir. Counselor. Just a minute. - What should I tell him? - I don't want to talk to him. He asks you to excuse him... ...and to give me a message. All right. I'll convey your message, counselor. Goodbye. Counselor Jiménez said he will be right over. He wants to discuss some issues concerning your late wife's insurance. Besides, he says it is urgent you give the names of the witnesses... ...in order to apply for your new marriage license. God has granted me life to contemplate such things. What am I to do? You regret it, don't you, Esteban? Who am I to regret it, sir, but a mere old... ...servant who knew your late wife... ...since she was barely more than a child. You cannot tell a heart by looking at a face. How can I know what is going on inside your heart, sir? You must have you reasons for doing what you're doing. Although I agree, that loneliness is easy for no man. For none. There is no worse punishment than loneliness, Esteban. Don't go yet. Stay a bit longer. Talk to me about her. I am afraid to sadden you with my memories which will also make me sad. This fireplace... ...has aged so much... that it lets the smoke leak now. You want memories, sir. It is natural. Your trip was meant to help you get over this. Wasn't it? My trip! It was like trying to put out a fire with a sea of fuel. But...talk to me. Tell me about her. If you will excuse me, she was a sweet, quiet child. But inside she was stern and full of willpower. I had to save my love from the dangers that were threatening it. Elena felt it. To protect us, I was prepared to everything. I must finish with the desire, by killing the woman that embodies it. But destiny was preparing me something different. It was the night of our wedding anniversary. I was about to complete my purpose. That was the decisive moment. But, the gaze of Elena got in my way. I felt she knew everything. So I had to postpone... ...the terrible moment of what I thought was going to be my freedom. Come! You have to light on the candles. It was me who suggested Demetrio to bring Raquel to the party. I prepare everything so they could stay at the end. That way, I could prepare everything I've planned for Raquel. - Let's go, Demetrio! - Don't go! Take one last drink! What do you prefer? By chance, as if something was helping me for my crazy purposes... ...each one had asked for a different beverage. Elena wanted champagne. Demetrio, whiskey... ...and Raquel, cognac. My chemical knowledge had helped me to calculate all... ...in a few hours, taking into account Raquel's physical conditions... ...I will achieve the desire effect, and no one could blame me for her death. Sir! But in those moments, something got my attention. Dr. Vidaurri wanted to talk to me about my wife's health... ...and about what had happened that day, it was severe. He waited for me at the lab, he didn't want Elena to see him. Your wife can live, just if she has a rigorous diet and if she doesn't have... ...strong or unhappy emotions. If not, I won't be responsible. Your wife's life is in your hands. Good night! Elena's life is in my hands. I stay there, thinking about this terrible fact. I promise to wholly dedicate myself to Elena. Meanwhile, in the living room, the desire must be vanishing... ...Rachel must have drunk the poison. One minute later, I don't know why, she left my home with Demetrio. What happened? Why did they go? What are you doing with that drink? Elena! Elena! Elena had drunk the drink. Trying to kill Raquel, an ironic tragedy made me finish with what I love the most. I tried all to save her. But everything was in vain. Those words were so terrifying and truth. A man can kill what he loves the most. A coward man with a kiss, a brave one with a sword. These few words surround my entire tragedy. I'm the murderer of my wife. Excuse me, sir. Mr. Jiménez has just arrived. I'll be there in a minute. What are they suggesting? It has been a murder, not a natural death? They just want to defend themselves. The expert doctors doesn't anticipate a sudden death. Knowing that the policy was bought by your wife when she was very healthy. That's why I sent you the telegram. Assholes! Don't do anything to obtain the money from that insurance! Any amount can help me to compensate Elena's lost. Ok! Good night! Hello! The plane takes off in half an hour, you have 15 minutes to arrive. At your service. 707. Raquel... ...I have to explain you something. If you prefer not to do it, I'll understand it. On the contrary... ...now it's better than ever. Both of us need this confession. A confession? I thought everything was clear between us. I told you everything on time. I don't want to go back. Listen to me. This is the end. We can't keep on with this. I've tried to kill you and... ...I can do it again. I don't understand anything. You are mad! What's going on? I have to tell you everything. You are very proud because you're telling me the truth. Now you think you're so big. You've always wanted to be like that. Generous, honest, worthy, pure. Why did you tell it to me? Because you feel mercy for me or for my rotten life? Are you feeling mercy for you? Or is just compassion for your own sufferings? You've never thought in anything else... ...just in yourself and in your own salvation. Your selfishness is wild and strong because you hide it. You want to purify your faults through the others. Yes, I can see everything. You tried to kill me and why? Because you love me or your wife? No. You don't love anybody. You just love yourself... ...your moral and integrity. Now you're defeated. You can't kill anybody. You can't kill me. You lost your last weapon when you confess. It was the strength that your silence gave you. You understood everything. Those are my own words. I repeated them constantly, day and night. Let me get lost! Don't make me take you to hell. Why have you come? Why are you looking at me that way? Go away! Don't repeat insults you will regret later. Now it is my turn to speak. I don't want to hear it. Especially not from you. Of course. It's like hearing your own conscience. But I don't want to make reproaches. Did you forget I'm your friend in spite of everything? - What has happened with Antonio? - I don't want to give explanations. - I can handle it myself. - It takes a stubborn person. I just want to help you as if nothing had happened. Speak! You can imagine what happened. He left you. - I told you so. - Unfortunately, you were right. I was blinded by the idea that he killed for me. Explain yourself. He killed her. But only due to a fortunate mistake. - He tried to kill me. - That creep. How did it happen? Did he tell you? He confessed it himself. He was becoming very bitter. Forget your sensitivity, try to grasp what that confession means. I don't understand. You changed since you met him. If he behaved poorly, why not pay him back with his own medicine? I mean charge him the harm done in real, counting money. After all, it would be a fair pay-back. I won't use your methods. Allow me to use mine. Oh, yours. You are in no condition of considering any methods. You have behaved in a childish, ridiculous way. And I'm being kind with words. I could use others. You walked out on me in Panama like I was disposable! Now it turns that you won't take advantage of a privileged situation. Nobody said that. But I claim my right of doing it my way. We would be in unsurpassable circumstances... ...for the creation of a chemical industrial subsidiary. The advantages of this perspective are obvious to anybody. We'd have access to more raw material than up to now. Excuse me, Mr. ITUARTE. There's a lady who wants to see you. How you dare interrupt? I'm sorry, but... she says she is your fiancé. Hello, darling. I'm sorry, I had to see you. I was at the insurance company. There is an unacceptable clause. The company reserves the right to perform an autopsy on me... ...if it is deemed necessary to pay in case I should die. Isn't that hideous? Or perhaps I misunderstood it? Aren't you going to introduce me to your friends? Gentlemen... Miss Raquel Serrano, my fiancé. Miss, at your service. - Miss. - Miss. It is a pleasure. Forgive my intrusion. Believe me, it was involuntary. I was outraged. I'll go now. You are all invited to our wedding, of course. Oh, certainly. See you, Antonio. I'll expect you for dinner. Mr. Antonio in the name of my associates... ...and mine, our greatest congratulations. And now, Mr. Villarreal will read the project... ...presented by Mr. ITUARTE in regard to the creation... ...of a mercantile corporation.subsidiary of Industrial Chemical, Limited. "Project for the creation of a limited company... ...between Mr. Antonio ITUARTE, Mr. Rafael..." Autopsy! Now she knows my secret, she will use it to the end. She will force me to marry her. I am my wife's murderer. To marry her! If they exhume her body they will find evidence. My wife's murderer. There is no possible alternative. Marry. I declare in the name of the law and society... ...that you are legally joined in matrimony... ...with all the rights and prerogatives granted by law... ...and the obligations it implies. Why do all my orders seem to upset you? I obey them, madam. Yes, but against your will. Tell me what's wrong. I'm listening. I wish I had told you before you asked. You have tried to obliterate Miss Elena's memory from this house. She is only a shadow now, but... ...it is stronger than you, and will win in the end. You mustn't forget it. That is all. Mrs. ITUARTE. The perfect frame for a work of art. More than a goddess. Now you can say that you're at the peak. Beauty, luxury, fortune. What else can you ask of life? That's what it comes down to for you. What else can it come down to? I am acquainted with life. Demetrio made a sculpture of you. I made more. I made a woman. You are my best piece. I sculpt living flesh. But then... ...that's not what I wanted to discuss with you. Although I am very modest... ...even a man like myself needs certain fees. Could you provide me with, say, one hundred thousand pesos? That would solve everything, including my silence. Try to understand my position. Mrs. ITUARTE has the word. I am listening eagerly. In that tone, Nacho. I don't know how to explain, but things have changed. - Oh, I can tell, I can tell. - Ask me for anything but money. I don't want to be a vulgar crook in Antonio's eyes. He would not understand. I see you have changed, and I congratulate you. But although you consider your husband's crime a declaration of love... ...for me it is still a blank check. The facts are brutal, but... ...they are the facts. I know your pride is hurt. I've told you it isn't my fault. If you want vengeance, go ahead. I am determined to everything, I have my own weapons. All right. - Is this your way of ending it? - Yes, this is my way of ending it. Speak Raquel, tell me everything. Take me out of this horrible nightmare. It was more than that, Antonio. Worse than hell... ...was the risk of you having a bad image of me. But, when you went to say goodbye to me... ...I realized in an instant that you loved me. That you had never stopped loving me. And giving up that wonderful truth was impossible. I was about to believe that you would never utter these words. It is clear that we are united by something indestructible. Something beyond ourselves. We cannot turn back now, Raquel. We shall go together to salvation or to death. I will help you dissipate the shadows that bind you. As terrible as our sin may be we have a right to our piece of heaven. Mr. and Mrs. Antonio ITUARTE. Upon your arrival in New York your funds will be available. - Thank you, counselor. - Have a good trip. - Mr. Antonio ITUARTE? - Yes. You cannot leave the city, there is a warrant. How is that? I am his lawyer. Please explain. On grounds of murdering his first wife. That is insane! Calm down. I will immediately apply a recourse and post bail. It's a maneuver based on interest. It is not so easy to get rid of a willing shadow. - What did you say? - Nothing. I was thinking of stalking you. You may rest assured that everything will be settled satisfactorily. Nothing matters if we are together. ANTONIO ITUARTE IS ACCUSED OF MURDER HE POISONED HIS FIRST WIFE ANTONIO ITUARTE PRISONER I swear he is innocent! Can you give us objective information on his behalf? Material facts; no. Like I can't prove that you are a murderer either, Officer. Antonio did not kill. Nobody who truly loves could be a criminal. Your words couldn't be more touching but they are completely worthless. I ask you to strike her statement... ...due to lack of grounds, from the offender's wife. In any case, she could turn out to be an accomplice... ...if I can prove it, as I hope I will. I wouldn't care if I were. He is innocent! Based on the chargers, I ask the body to be exhumed... ...and an autopsy to be performed. TODAY WE WILL KNOW THE RESULT OF THE AUTOPSY This document ratifies Dr. Vidaurri's certificate. "The forensic doctors commissioned by the District Attorney... ...render the following statement: One: No evidence at all was found that Mrs. ITUARTE was poisoned. Two: Cardiac collateral hypertrophy was found. And three: Mrs. Elena G. ITUARTE died of a sudden rupture... ...of an aortic aneurysm." In order to confirm the facts, I'd like to call one last testimony. Granted. Although the doctor forbade it, she joined the party downstairs. When all the guests parted... ...except for Mrs. Raquel and her companion; Mr. Antonio,... ...has been called by Dr. Vidaurri, and my Miss Elena... ...in a sudden manner and seemed to be very nervous. Very nervous. Your mission is over in this house. You are dismissed. Let us go, Demetrio! Good night, madam. It looked like she was about to faint again. As if she didn't have the strength to hold on to it... ...the content of her glass spilt on the carpet. Esteban. Call my husband. I didn't have to call him, he arrived at that moment. Naturally, I retired as not to be indiscreet. Antonio! You are free now, Antonio. Faith in our love has saved us. The strength of our love produced a miracle. You didn't kill her, Antonio, no. She died her own death. No shadow will ever come between us. Never. Nobody has been able to untie us! The night is gone forever, Antonio. Antonio! Antonio! Antonio! The End
