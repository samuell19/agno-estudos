All Of The Hostages Are Dead, Most Of The Arabs Are Dead, Three Of Them Are In Hospitals, What Happened ? And One Of Them May Still Be On The Loose. It's Over. Everybody's Dead. They're All Gone.

You Think They're Wringing Their Hands And Packing Their Bags Over This Thing ? They Came Here To Win A Goddamn Race ! Now, Maybe Viren's A Sensitive Humanitarian Back In Finland, But Right Now I'll Bet There's A Little Voice In His Head, Saying, "Hey, I Just Got An Extra Day's Rest For The 5,000."
