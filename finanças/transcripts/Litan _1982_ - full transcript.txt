TILL DEATH DO US PART, JACK + NORA At 9h30 at the cemetery. Hello, the geological studies office? Yes... Hello! Jock Macel, please. It's Nora speaking. Not there. - Then where is he? - Black Rocks. The Black Rocks? But... I hope you'll be back in time to finish my hearings, Nora! Hello, Mrs Nora. - Mr Thiraudet. Excuse me, I'm in a hurry. What's the matter? Come. I'm sorry. The Black Rocks, please. Take the bus down the street. - Thanks. When does the bus for the Black Rocks come? - I don't know; it's already late. Open the door. Get in! What's with you? Start it up. See you tonight. Pardon me, are you going to the Black Rocks? How could this happen? An ace driver like you! How could you lose control of your vehicle? Cornel! Cornel, where are you going? Come back! Don't be scared! Today is Litan's day, everybody is thrilled! Amen. Let's go. What's wrong? - The engine. Like every year on Litan's day, we're gonna chase the monster and catch it. On my signal, the chase begins. Go! The Black Rocks, please? Thanks. Dad, it's me, Eric. Did you see them? - They're right behind you, beat it! That way. Jock! At the top! Did you see the monster? Over there. - Come on. That way. - Shut up! Please, did you see a tall man? - Over there, Mrs. Excuse-me, I'm looking for Jock; Jock Macel. Isn't he working with you? You still didn't see the monster? Why won't you tell me where he is? Don't worry like this. JOCK! Help me... Help me. Eric... Eric... He was half drowned when I found him. Stupid scout games! Take him to the hospital with the car, I'll finish your job. At last, you're alive! What's wrong? I'm not the wounded one! I had a terrible nightmare. I dreamt you were killed. Nora baby, your dreams again? We caught it! Leave him alone. He's wounded! Wait! I'll come with you. Wait! Look! We caught it! We have to call the police. - To tell them what? That you have nightmares? No...To tell them the kid had an accident up there. He just slipped and fell in the water. Look, he's not breathing anymore. Take him to admissions, I'll go to the police. Jock, I don't want to stay alone with this guy. I'm scared. Your dreams again! Go on in, I'll be right there. What has Bohr done to you? What has he done? First he didn't want to say where you were. Then... He tried to catch me and kiss me. I... Don't leave me alone. I'm looking for admissions, doctor. My son... My son fell in the underground river at the Black Rocks. His head might be hurt. Don't worry like this. - That's exactly what he said. He'll never do that again. Go see the police. I don't even remember where it is. - It's just across the street. We'll meet later. Do you know where Mr Bohr and his son are? We've registered nobody under that name today. That's impossible, they arrived just five minutes ago. Then, they must be right here. Those ones have been waiting an hour already. You can't go in. - Do you wanna bet!? Can I help you? Yes. Can you tell me if you've seen a tall man with a boyscout come by? Try on the second floor or in the emergencies. Thanks anyways. Hello, Hello? The cemetery? But who are you? I don't understand. I don't understand. Who could have tried to burn my hotel? I only had one enemy in my life... 97And thank God, he died two years ago. Yes, but... The one who put those clothes on fire is well and alive... It's impossible, he's dead. - Miss? I'd like to have a word with you. - Can I help you? Yes. Hello. The geological department? Bohr speaking. I'm in the hospital. My son has been hurt. They're examining him right now. Send someone immediately to the Black Rocks to delay the detonators. Hello? I can't hear you. At the cemetery... - Who are you? That's impossible. Aren't you done yet? What's wrong with my son? Married? - No we're not. But that has nothing to do with my dream. - Nothing, because your dream is meaningless. Premonitions, visions... It's all bullshit. I repeat; Something terrible happened to Eric up there. The only terrible thing happening is that I'm missing my lunch for nothing! Come. As your mayor, I thank you once more for your good behavior, on behalf of the residents of our flowery city. As your mayor, I thanks you once more for your good behavior, on behalf of the residents of our flowery city. "Let's have a walk in the wood..." "Aren't you done yet? What's wrong with my son?" Excuse-me! I'm looking for a man... - You just found him! Do you fancy me? This laboratory is forbidden to visitors. Sorry. Murderer. You didn't see them either? - No, commissioner. Someone asked before you. Try upstairs. Did you see a hysterical brunette? - A brunette? She dragged me here then vanished. Whatever. Filthy butchers! You'll never get me! Never! Ok, Jesus Christ, that's enough for today. Come on. Bohr! Where are you? Bohr! If your son didn't... Filthy butchers! You'll never get me! Never! Mrs Clement, Estelle speaking. I don't feel well, I'd like to be covered for. At 3? I think I can handle it until then, thanks. Steve? Estelle. Can you come for a moment? I really need to talk to you. It's very important. No, I... Steve, I know what you've done. Here. He was tied to this bed. But... He was in this bed! Well he's not anymore. Unless he got younger. Cut it out! This is Mr. Flores. He's been in this bed for two months. You've also mentioned a corpse. Over there. He was here. He was here? His throat sliced. Yes! I can't see no trace of him. Let me clean this. There's always lots of blood in a hospital. I see. Thank you, Miss Servais. I'm really starting to be put off by you and your silly girlfriend. What?! I said I'm really starting to be put off by you and your silly girlfriend. Your face... Your face! It's nothing. Come. Commissioner Bolek speaking. Can you hear me? I want you to stop a 4X4 Mercedes with a brunette and a dark haired guy. Hello? Can you hear me? Yes, commissioner. Are you afraid of those kids? I just remembered Bohr's set detonators. They can blow up at any time. There's nobody left up there anyway. They're all at the party. Let's get our things and leave this city. You go first, I'll meet you later. - No way. I'll stick with you. Turn back quickly! Hey you! What are you doing? It's restricted! They saw us. We can't take the car anymore. Hey! Hey you! Hey! Did you see anyone come in? He's dissolved. He fell into the tank and he's dissolved! It's probably full of acid they use to clean the skins. Thief! Thief! No! Not that way! I saw him falling in my dream. But the dynamite can explode at anytime. Come! Mr Macel, tell my uncle I'm waiting for him. - As soon as I see him. Who is she? - Bohr's niece. Why don't you tell her that... - Because I don't have time! Are you sure he fell into it? - I saw him slip down on that drainpipe. Nobody thought about taking the body out? - No, I just stayed to keep a watch... What kind of acid do you use? How the hell should I know? Hey! What kind of shit do you put into this? Absolutely nothing dangerous for the workers. No acid or detergents? Of course not. Just some cleaning products. Yet it seems the body has been dissolved. Are you from the board of health? No. I'm in charge of the hospital's research office. What kind of research? We study why some sick persons stop struggling and die when some others in worse shape manage to survive. What are you doing here? I was with the commissioner when he heard about the accident and he asked me to join him. Let's get back to this. Whathappened after you saw the car? Come quickly! I told him not to put it here! Why didn't you report they're here? The radio's dead, commissioner. Run away! It's dangerous to stay here! Come, Natascha. That's insane. At least someone should had seen them. What?! She seems to be speaking some dialect. Anyone here understand it? I do. What did you say? Shit. What's wrong? - There are two missing. Don't you think he put them along the cemetery? No. I told him not to put anything there. It's like a small earth tremor. It wasn't worth the work. What was she saying before? She saw a man and a woman picking things from the rocks. Was the woman a brunette? Yes, she was. Ask her where she saw them. Over there. The motorcyclist's legs are broken. - We already called an ambulance. I'll take care of it. But who are you? Yann. But you're crazy: Yann is dead. You're letting this happen? That's your wife! Are you hurt? No, I don't think so. Slowly. Be careful. My God, what did they try to do? Excuse-me, I'm Miss Bohr. My uncle was working here and he's vanished. Can you help us find him? What was he doing here? He's working on Litan's research center. He just did what Mr. Macel asked him. I'll let you know if I hear something. But I can assure you'll see him again. Thank you, sir. - Take Miss Bohr back to the park. Commissioner Bolek wants to see you. There's injured people. The operation's all set. They can't escape. You seem at ease in this rathole! I love speleology. Like many others in Litan. We even have a club. You should come with us sometimes. No way. You won't get me. Where I come from, we like to see where we step... Look. The cemetery grounds collapsed because of the blast. Just what we needed! Do you think what's left up there is gonna squash us? No. I think the whole thing's collapsed already. It's not possible. The explosion couldn't have caused all this. That was a strong jolt. The consequences are bigger than what I'd thought. It can collapse at anytime. Did you ever wonder why we lock our dead in lead coffins? Because they're full of germs. And why we burry them in stone vaults as though we were afraid they'd escape? Frankly, I've got no idea. The same ray I saw in the tannery's tank. - It's just chemical. The tremor's liberated an unknown ore that's dissolved into the water. But how can you explain that I've seen those rays in my dream? I know nothing about dreams but perhaps it's nothing more than glowworms living in the river. You're just saying that to reassure me. Don't tell worms turn blue under water. - Then perhaps it's just another type of worm. In some countries, people try to know if their dead found a better life on the other side. What are you talking about? - In India, people come from everywhere to purify the souls of their dead in the Ganga's holy waters. So? - So the souls can have a better life after they're reborn. They can do what they want as long as it's away from my jurisdiction! Superstitious fools! - Just like me! I also believe in the metempsychosis of the souls. It's always smart and cultured people like you who believe in that kind of twaddle. The other... Look at this... It's a scarf. It belongs to the girl. Do you know why I'm afraid to die? Because you know there's nothing after. Just like a blown bulb; It's over! No. I don't think it's over when we die. Well... I don't know much about it. What's wrong? Look. The sides of the coffin are scratched... As though the buried one's tried to exit. But they can't bury someone without a death certificate. They can't! Of course. A doctor has to examine the body. But what if he's drunk or incompetent? By the way, you're right: if it's not finished after death, we bury the dead alive! Don't joke like that! I'd rather not think about it. You should think about it if you think there's life after death. I don't know anymore. I think there's a life after death. But I don't know if there's a God, a heaven, a hell... But if God exists, what difference does it make if you're alive or dead? I don't care about what's after death. All I want... is to live with you. - Then we'll keep each other company till the end of time! Commissioner! There's a crack. You can exit that way. Follow the river over there, I'll take them from the rear. But be careful, Macel is kinda violent. Are you coming, doctor? Be careful not to fall into the water, because of the rays. Cut it out with these rays of yours! We must get out of here. I'm afraid. How can you explain that... I've seen those rays in my dream? Listen... The police are chasing us and could be here at any moment. We must get out of here. - How? You just want to put me at ease. Listen... We have to follow the river. As fast as we can. As fast as we can. Have you seen Dr Julien? - No but we need him. The motorcyclist has fallen from the rope. Then take him to the hospital. The couple we're looking from can exit only by that way. We've only seen coffins and broken crosses, that's all. There's someone I'd love to see in a coffin. Once outside we'll have to split as quickly as we can. Do you think they'll try to stop us? - I do. That's it. It's not that bad after all. As long as I'm with you. I'll build one for two people, we'll be more comfortable. Mummy... He's the man who ran over the medic this morning. Come, come. Take them. And now you're gonna tell me what's really happened to Bohr. You'll never understand anything anyway! Steve, your wife... She is... When? - A few minutes ago. If they lock us up, we're gonna die! Probably from starvation because no one will be left to feed us. They're all gonna be dead! What's that noise? Look at your friend over there. You don't like my friend? Come on, calm down! You have to do something for the city! Don't speak all together. Leave me alone! Shut up or I'll lock all of you up! We're paying your salaries! This time, he's burned my hotel. Fire... Beat it at the first opportunity. - No, I'll stay with you! Don't worry about me! Jock! Tell the office what's happening here and then go home. And stay there at all costs! I don't agree with all this. - Tell it to the chief. The night will be falling soon. I know. We can't wait anymore. This time Koonst, you're gonna give back everything you stole from me. Are you gonna tell the truth now? Ok, Macel, shut up if you want. I'll lock you up for assaulting a police officer... Desecrating graves and maybe even for Bohr's murder. And then we'll lock up that stupid little witch of yours. For resisting a police officer. Thank you. You gave us the reason! Run, baby. Don't let them catch you! Let's beat it, buddies. This old fart freaks me out! Sir... Please. My husband is working for you. He disappeared! That's it, just seat on your ass! - Can't you see we need help? They can't hear us. They are... You're wrong, Mrs. I can hear you loud and clear. I'm maybe one of the last who can. Then please help us! I can't do anything. The phone is out of service. And all my staff is gone. I can just tell you to run away from Litan. As quickly as you can. Come. Anybody home? Anybody home? Over here, quickly! I'm looking for my uncle and cousin. I'd waited for them at the celebration but I... Your cousin is alive, I've seen him but he might be in danger. Do you know where they are? Get me out of here, I'll tell you everything I know. But where are they? Take the keys. Take the keys and I'll tell you everything. Take the keys. Take them from his belt and be careful of the gun! Take the bunch of keys, he won't stop you. Leave as quickly as you can! Come with us! We'll be safe if we stay together. - No, I can't! Arrest the husband of the chick, the one who always want to shoot himself. I'll meet you at Thiraudet's. At the stock, ok? - Yes, chief. You. Lock up the other suspects for extra questioning, understood? Yes, commissioner. Call him. It's a policeman, he'll know what to do! And what is that gonna change? Anyway, I'm my own police now! I've got an arrest warrant for Nora Macel. Did you see her lately? Not since this morning. She left as if she were being chased by the police. How long has she been living here? Hands up! Hands up, all of you! Drop your knives! Drop them, I said! But then it was true! They weren't lying. It was true. I tried to ask for help at the office. There was nobody. We can only rely on ourselves. As we did so far. - We're just the two of us. Two lonesome wolves. Blood brothers. Not brothers. Lovers. What does it mean to be dead, Koonst? Alone. Alone. Keep going. It's like floating. You can feel the other dead around you. But you can't neither talk to them nor see them. Is that all? No heaven, no hell? Nothing? Nothing. You're just there and you wait. Sometimes you dream for a while then you wait again. What are you waiting for? - To see the living die and join us in our dream. - What kind of dream? We're dreaming your life and when the dream stops, you die. But you came back. In Eric's body. We're like two shadows struggling for the same body. Soon we'll be just one soul. What will happen to Eric? He'll be just a memory of someone I was a very long time ago. Like when you feel you remember something that actually happens to you for the first time. Something or somebody. Someone who was inside you. You've replaced Eric. - No. I've been stronger than him, so I'll remember his life as if it had been mine. You'd took my wife Koonst, and when you died last year, she stopped enjoying life. She died this afternoon but she'll live again before tonight and she'll be mine. Steve, are you sure you know enough about it to succeed? Absolutely. Take us to the heliport, that's our last chance. Get in. This man's trying to go home but nobody will let him in. They don't recognize him. They think he's dead. She'll never love you again, Koonst. Neither in your new life nor in another one. "Alert. Alert. Dr Julien is needed." "Alert. Alert. Dr Julien is needed." Are you afraid? A little bit. But without you, my life is worthless. And you can't stop loving her... You'll have to be very strong or she'll dominate you and then never love me again. I'm as strong as her. Even stronger because I love you. What a beauty! Faster! Faster! Jock, don't fight, he's gonna kill you. It was in my dream! Stop it, Steve, it's too late! You're alive! But then, my dream... - It was bullshit. What about us? - There's rapids. We'll go by the mountain. We'll have to deal with the current. What if it's the same on the other side of the mountain? No big deal: 'cause if we die, we'll stay together! God almighty, have mercy on us. You'd chose Litan's day to put us through this terrible ordeal, God almighty. But we don't want to die a second time. We just want to sleep and dream. Be merciful on us, Lord. Sleep... And dream. Translation: Aquasantajoe Timing and proofreading: Pushwithlegs For Cinemageddon, May 2010
