Oh, Arthur, isn't this exciting? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just imagine, darling, in a few minutes we'll be man and wife. Yeah. I hope I know what I'm doing. Married amidst the birds and the bees and the little flowers. - You, you like little flowers? - Mm-hmm. What's the matter with LaGuardia? Why didn't we get married before we left New York? Why Maryland? Because it's more romantic eloping like this. Eloping from what? Who's stopping us? You're an orphan and my family disowned me for voting democratic. Come on. You don't seem very happy about marrying me. Oh, I am, Vivian. Believe me, honey, I'm, I'm very happy. But you don't show it. Listen, I said I was happy, didn't I? I know when I'm happy. I'm very happy. See? Come on, let's get this over with. The bells. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Arthur, isn't it sweet? I'm just about to give you the best years of my life. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just, just one favor, honey. For once, don't talk too much. When the justice says you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband, just say I do. Don't make a career out of it, huh? - 'Good morning.' - Good morning, judge. Yattaty, yattaty, yattaty, yattaty. Did I marry a woman or a tobacco auctioneer. Goodbye, folks. Goodbye and good luck. Thank you, judge. We'll come again sometime. Yeah... Now did you have to tell the guy you were an ex-chorus girl? Does he care if I gave up my defense plan to take a job in Washington? But, darling, I simply told him that you were the new assistant to Stanley Slade head at the Bureau Of Intermural Cooperation. It's the Administrator Of Inter-Bureau Coordination. Oh, uh, how do you expect me to remember all those big names? Why didn't you join something easy like the senate or the Supreme Courthouse? Vivian, you don't join the senate. It's not like the Elks or the Rotary Club. Come on. Hello, Dukey. Hello, little fellow. Were you lonesome, hmm? Did you miss your little mommy? I'm so sorry. Mommy's married now, Dukey. Hey, what did you mean when you told the judge I got a Washington job because I know President Hoover. Well, is that anything to be ashamed of? No, only Hoover isn't there anymore. They got a new boy now. Darling, are you gonna carry me over the threshold? Oh, I can't, baby, I got all these other bags. - Come on. - Come on, Dukey. Come on. Arthur, I'm surprised it's not so crowded here. From all I've read and heard about conditions in Washington... That's newspaper talk, honey. Just goes to show you how they exaggerate. - Yes, sir? - I, uh, I have a reservation. Yes, sir. Mr. Jordan? You can tell we're in Washington now, Arthur. - Look at all the brass hats. - Yeah. Uh, brass hats? Vivian, those are cuspidors. Good morning. You have a reservation, sir? Yes, the name is Halstead. - Arthur Halstead. - And wife. Of course, the honeymoon couple. I'm sure you'll like our bridal suite. Wonderful view of the Potomac. Although so few of the occupants notice it. 11B, please. Hello. Oh, hello, Mr. Jordan. How are... I what? But I can't get out. What am I gonna tell my bride? I explained that these arrangements were only temporary. I hope I'm not putting you out but I'll, uh, have to put you out. - Well, okay, Mr. Jordan, but... - 'Oh, Julian.' I wish you were up here and, and I was down there. Oh, Julian darling, I didn't wanna do anything while you were away, but now that you're back you can help me rearrange all this furniture. I'm going to take the drapes out of our bedroom and put them in this bedroom. Honey, before you do that... They'll look much better in there and... Oh, that awful desk in the corner, it has to go. And, uh, there's something else that has to go. - What? - Us. What? Your suite will be ready in a minute. You see? Crowded Washington. I told you it was only newspaper talk. Front boy, get up to the 11th floor. - They're checking our of 11B. - Checking out of 11B. Yes. They're checking out of 11B. - Somebody checking out? - Yes, sir. - Is somebody checking out? - Yeah, somebody's checking out. - Come, you little... - Somebody checking out? Yes, yes, indeed. Somebody's checking out. - Is somebody checking out? - Yes. Yes. - Somebody's checking out. - Is somebody checking out? - Yes. - Oh. Pardon me, somebody's checking out. Somebody's checking out. Somebody's checking out. Somebody's checking out. Hey, Joe, somebody's checking out. Somebody's checking out. Edna, those people are on their way up. Can't you pack a little faster? I only have two hands, you know? - You didn't marry an octopus. - Hey, where are you goin'? You're not thinking of taking a bath now, are you? What do you want me to do? Use the pool at the Lincoln Memorial? Oh, but, honey, you've got to cooperate. - This is a national emergency. - So is my bath. That's a very un-American attitude. Oh, is that so? Alright, so I'm a bottleneck. Expose me. Write a letter to Winchell. - Oh, hello. - I'm sorry, Mr. Cadman. - I thought you'd be out by now. - So did I. But I ran in to a red-headed bottleneck. Come on in. Well, uh, there's, there's no great rush. - I can wait outside. - Oh, not at all. Their time is up. Sit down. I'm sure Mrs. Cadman won't mind. Mind? I certainly do mind. You might at least wait until my bed gets cold. Make yourself right at home, Mr. Halstead. If there's anything you want, just ask for it. That's right. Just ask for it. Then try and get it. Uh, my wife's a little upset. The, the heat bothers her. Yeah, well, it, it bothers my wife too. - Does it? - Yes. As a matter of fact, she's down the drugstore now getting some bath salts. - She is? - Yes. I, I, uh, I know she can't wait to get in to a nice cold tub. - She can't? - No, Pollyanna, she can't. - Bring your wife up. - Sure. I'd love to have her. She can scrub my back! I want to apologize for my wife. - She gets a little excited. - Oh, I noticed that. Sit down, sit down. - Have a cigarette. - Thanks, I, uh... As a matter of fact, I'm a little excited myself. I just got married an hour ago. Well, I beat you by seven days. - Yeah? Congratulations. - Yeah, congratulations. We got married a week ago, but I don't know. There's a jinx on us or somethin'. Why? Well, five minutes after the ceremony I suddenly have to hop a plane to Chicago on business. - Without the bride? - Yeah. The poor kid had to stay here alone. Now I'm back five minutes and they're gonna toss us out. - On our honeymoon. - Oh. - Oh, oh, pardon me, pardon me. - Oh, silly. Must have a big deal to take you away from this. Oh, it meant my whole future and the deal still isn't closed. But do women understand those things? Do they understand what important business means? All women understand is talk. Talk, talk, talk, talk. Yattaty, yattaty, yattaty, yattaty... They just don't understand. Oh. Oh, I guess you're a little excited yourself. - Yeah, I guess I am. - Frankly, I think we both are. Women make you do the silliest things sometimes. Yeah, they certainly do. Well, I guess I better get downstairs and pay my bill. I feel like a heel getting you to rush back like this. Well, it's alright, don't think anything about it. Things like that happen these days. Sorry about my wife holding you up like this. She doesn't really need a bath. Uh, that is... Oh, excuse me. - Darling, this is lovely. - Isn't it? Here, Dukey, come on, up, up. Come on. Up. Attaboy. Well, baby, this is it. - My great big hubby. - Yeah. You know, I, I'm sorry I yelled at you during the ceremony. 'Cause I think you're the most beautiful little pie face. Flatterer. - You know what I wanna do? - What? - How about I order up a drink? - Oh. Well, get me one too. Okay. Room service. - I'll make myself comfortable. - Mm-hmm. Wait a minute. - Don't go in there. - Why not? There's a woman in there taking a bath. What? In my water? She's the wife of the guy who ju... What? Oh, it's busy, okay. Well, isn't she supposed to be out of there by now? Now, now. Well, I'll get her out of there. Honey, the woman's just taking a bath. Don't put your foot in it. Miss? Miss, I'd like to use my bathroom if you don't mind. - There's another one. Use that. - Well, I wanna use this one. When I'm good and ready and it might take weeks. - 'Listen, you.' - Beat it! Of all the rotten nerve, taking a bath on our time. Now, now, honey, she'll be out in a moment. I think I'm gonna freshen up, change my clothes. - What for? - What? Of course, you want me to make a first good impression on Stanley Slade. Well, yes, but not now. Couldn't you call him up and tell him you're busy or somethin'? I'm afraid the Administrator Of Inter-Bureau Coordination wouldn't understand. - Oh, Arthur. - Now, baby. Look, honey, I'll be back in a little while. We'll have a wonderful dinner up here, just the two of us. Then I'll have him send up a nightcap. Arthur, you're not gonna sleep in one those old-fashioned things, are you? Answer that, Vivian, will you? Hello, Dukey. Hello? Room service, would you send up a bottle of scotch and some ice water, please? 'Come in.' Where do you want this, lady? Oh, uh, put it in the... No, put it in there. That's it. Just open the door and go right in. This will teach her, Dukey. Get out of here! Excuse me. Hey! What are you doin' out there? Selling tickets? You've been in there so long, I'd forgotten all about you. Hello? Yes, it is. Who? Oh, put him on. Hello, Mr. Slade. This is Mrs. Halstead. You are so lucky. We just got in. Oh, well, I'm looking forward to meeting you too. Mr. Halstead is dressing at the moment. Can I take a message? Oh, that's alright. Arthur tells me everything. When we get settled here, you must come up. You and Mrs. Slade. Not married? Oh, well, that's too bad. Oh, we'll have to do something about that. Alright. Goodbye now. Well, well, well, well, well, well. Stop gushing, Stanley. She may not look as good as she sounds. Who? Oh, her. That was Mrs. Halstead. Must be a very charming woman. Hmm, I think I'll see her about joining my War Wives' Relief Corps. We need all the women we can get, you know. Uh, yes, we do, don't we? Ahem. Your car is here, Mrs. Cartwright. Well, thank you. Uh, Elizabeth Brush Cartwright. 'How large a donation do you want, Elizabeth?' - Uh, fifty dollars. - 'Fifty dollars.' Fifty dollars will keep my nursery babies in milk for a month. Get awfully mildewed, won't they? There you are. - Thank you, Stanley. - Hmm. - Tra-la. - Yeah, tra-la-la, tra-la-la. Who was that on the phone, honey? Mr. Slade. Stanley Slade? Why didn't you call me? What, do you have to jump just because he's your new boss? He'll wait. Help is very hard to get these days. Come in. Put it over there, waiter. - Shall I pour, honey? - Sure, sure. Go ahead. Help is very hard to get these days. Isn't it though? - Arthur? - Hm? Would you tell Mr. Slade that I'd like to get into something to help win the war? That should certainly change the betting odds. Well, before I went on the stage, I took shorthand and typing and I could brush up on it. Forget it, honey. The government's got enough trouble. Well, here's to us. Oh, Arthur, I love you. Couldn't have happened to a nicer fellow. - Well, goodbye, darling. - Bye. Oh, dear, will you take Duke downstairs? Oh, fine, fine. Come on, Duke, come on. Go on, Duke. Attaboy. Go along with daddy. Go along with daddy. Maybe I should take him to Slade's with me? Oh, no, don't bother. Just give Duke to a bellboy and tell him to walk him over to those Japanese cherry trees. Come on, Duke. Come on, come on. Bye, dear. If you're not out of there in two minutes I'm gonna call the manager. I'll be out of here in one minute and I'm coming out swinging. - Why, why, you... - 'Out of my way.' Here I come. And now you crummy little.. - Edna! - Darling. - Oh, what a surprise. - I didn't know it was you. Darling, I haven't seen you for months. What'd you do to your hair? Well, Arthur likes it short like this. You look wonderful. Oh, I've put on a couple of pounds since our hoofing days. Well, you aren't getting any younger. No, we aren't. Are we? Oh, is that scotch? Is there some soda? Phone for some. My, my, my. And almost full too. Room service? Busy? Oh, I'll hold on. Oh, the service in this place is terrible. I guess they're not used to having many people stop here. Room service. Send some club soda up to 11B right away. So you reserved this suite? Well, this is the break of the century. Julian and I were wondering where we were going to stay tonight. Say, I didn't know you were married. Well, darling, I didn't know you were married either. - Happened last week. - Correct me if I deserve it. But didn't this Julian of yours have a wife? Yeah, but she divorced him a year ago. Oh. Well, what's he doing in Washington? Waiting for an okay from the government. He and a chemist over at the Soviet Embassy have invented a new process for making cheap motor fuel out of soybeans. - Soybeans? - Sure. Haven't you heard the dirt about them? You can make anything out of soybeans. Caviar, Navajo blankets, eight-year-old scotch horse radish. Really? Think of all the horses they'll save. Come in. 'And I was mocking the service.' Sonny, you're just in time. - Uh, who takes these? - I'll take it. Oh, no, Edna, let me have it. This is my suite... No, don't be silly, I'll take it. - What's your husband name? - Arthur Halstead. - Arthur Halstead. There. - Thank you. Say, that, uh, husband of yours is a good-lookin' guy. Where'd you snag him? We were married a couple of hours ago in Pottsville, Maryland. It was so romantic. Pottsville? Sounds romantic. And, Edna, the funniest-looking justice you have ever seen. He must've have been 6'4" or 5". He looked like a prizefighter or a wrestler or somethin'. With a bashed and crooked nose. What do you care if he had a crooked nose as long as you're an honest woman? I'll take it. Oh, but it might be Arthur. Hello? Yeah. It's Julian, I'm sorry. He's been waiting down in the lobby. Fine language to use over the desk phone. Alright, darling, alright. But we don't have to look for a place. We can stay right here in the same suite with Vi. No. No. What do you care Vi who? Vi anybody. She's my oldest and dearest friend and she absolutely insists. Who's insisting? Alright, darling, go peddle your soybeans. Good luck. Meet us up here at 6:00 for cocktails. Please, Edna, you can't ask Julian up here. We'll take that room over there. - But Arthur will kill me. - No, he won't kill you. - It's against the law. - But... Oh, that's right. Shh, quiet. This is a surprise. 'Come in.' Hello, Dukey, Mr. Halstead will take care of the tip, boy. - Nan. - Vi. Nan darling, it's so good to see you. Where have you been hiding? I haven't seen you in years. Vi, are you a ventriloquist? I could have sworn I heard... Nan! Edna. - I don't believe it. - How'd you know I was here? Well, I ran into Duke in the lobby. He barked at me and I barked back. First friendly face I've seen in Washington. Well, here we are. - What are we waiting for? - Let's go. # Tada tada tada tada # Di di di di di # Di di di di di # Di di di di di # Oh, kids, we're, we're not as limber as we were in the good old days. What do you expect? Miracles. Vi, what did you do to your hair? Oh, Arthur likes it such short like this. - Arthur? - Behold! The child bride. And I am practically a bride myself. - Only not so childish. - How wonderful. Oh, that reminds me. I have to leave a message at the desk. Uh, hello, operator. If anyone asks for Mrs. Tom Dillon, I'm in 11B. Oh, please, please, Arthur will kill me. You've got to clear up, the both of you. Wait just a minute. What was that Mrs. Dillon crack? I also bagged myself one of the few available males. He's a flying lieutenant of Bolling Field. Oh, and you grounded him, eh? Come in. Oh, I beg your pardon. I must be in the wrong suite. Who are you looking for? I'm looking for Arthur Halstead. Oh, well, this is his suite. You've come to the right place. - Uh, yes, I can see that. - I'm Mrs. Halstead. Well, well, well, well, then it was you I talked to over the phone. I'm Stanley Slade. Oh, Mr. Slade. Come in, come in. Girls, this is my husband's new employer. - Mrs. Dillon, Mrs. Cadman. - How do you do? How do you do? Mr. Slade has a very important job administering between some bureaus. Oh, everyone knows Mr. Slade. Please sit down. Oh, thank you, thank you. That's very kind of you. - Ah, I'm so sorry. - Oh, well. Well, it's quite alright. I'm glad your foot wasn't in it. Would you care to have a drink? Uh, well, it's a little early for me. Yes. You just missed my husband. He went over to see you. Oh, he did? Well, that's too bad. Uh, is the candy for Mr. Halstead? Eh, well, no, no. I, uh, I took the liberty. Uh, you were so charming over the phone and as I was coming this way anyhow on, uh, government business, I just happened to be passing a little candy kitchen, and Delilah's they call it. And, uh, well, as long as I had talked to you on the phone... Oh, Mr. Slade, you didn't have to do this. Oh, yes, he did. Uh, well, that was alright. It was a pleasure. - Here's your drink. - Oh, thank you, thank you. Well, here's to something. Ah, there's nothing like relaxing in this bedlam. Uh, Washington, I mean. When I think how quiet it used to be in Wall Street. Why, I'd get down to my office at 10 o'clock and before lunch, I'd have finished reading "Look, Click" and sometimes even, eh, "Pick." Oh, I never knew what you men did all the time in Wall Street. I mean, these last few years. Oh, well, that wasn't my only activity. No, no. Mixed up in several things in those days. I backed one of the exhibits at the World's Fair. Hm, The South Sea Beauties. - Highly educational. - Hm, I'll bet. Uh, very talented girls. You see, we had a big tank and they'd dive into it. And then this man, he was got up as a giant lobster and... Uh, pardon me. Then this lobster fellow, you see, he'd swim after one of these girls and try to get his claws around her. And then she'd stab at him and fight him off with a knife. Wonderful girls. Practically lived underwater. Just came up for their salaries, I suppose. Um, um, yes, yes. Well, this has been very pleasant. Sort of brought me back to Wall Street. - Oh, must you go? - Well, I don't like to. But I don't want to keep your husband waiting, you know. - Mr. Slade. - Yes, Mrs. Halstead. I'd like to do something to end this war. - Quite an idea. - 'I can type.' And I can take shorthand if it isn't too fast. And I can file things and generally, I can find them. And if she can't, you can always offer a reward. Well, now, it seems to me that a young lady of your, uh talents ought to be squeezed in somewhere. It so happens that I could use another secretary. - You could? - Uh, just part-time, you know. This is the world record. I mean, take dictation, uh, speeches, you know. Perhaps attend some function or other. Might use up, uh, some of your evenings. Eh, would you mind that, hm? Not if it'll help win this war. Hello. Who? Oh, yes, yes. Of course, come right up. Please, please, Edna. Nobody else. - Arthur will kill me. - Well, not for this, he won't. Do you know who's coming up to see you? - Mr. Umbriago? - Much more important. Elizabeth Brush Cartwright. Three more people? Just one, but what a one. She is such a blue blood that the Red Cross turned down her plasma. Now important personality Mrs. Cartwright. A woman of great influence. Always in the news. Oh, yes. She had a big spread in "Vogue." Uh, big spread. Yes, that's her. Oh, if I were you ladies, I'd hide the liquor. Mrs. Cartwright is a teetotaler. Well, I don't care as long as she doesn't get drunk and pass out here. Dong! Well, goodbye, ladies, this has been most refreshing. And shall we say tomorrow at 1 o'clock? That would be wonderful. And then if you feel like a little lunch before you go to work, I think we can arrange that too. Oh, thank you. Well, hello, Elizabeth. I see you're right on the job. - Yes, uh, I see you are too. - I see... Well, goodbye, everybody. Bye now. I'm Mrs. Cartwright. Oh, yes, Mrs. Cartwright. Come in. Do come in. - So nice of you to call. - Thank you. Oh, this is Mrs. Halstead, Mrs. Dillon and I'm Mrs. Cadman. - Won't you sit down? - Thank you. Mrs. Cadman. Oh, yes. I've heard of your husband's process. Something to do with string beans, I believe. - Uh, soybeans. - Do they? Well, these are busy days, so I'll come right to the point. As you doubtless know, I am commander of the War Wives Relief Corps. You must join us, Mrs. Halstead. Well, really, Mrs. Cartwright, I... And your two friends too. This is my Lucky day. Three perfect recruits. Now if you ladies will just sign where the X is. Oh, you'll love the work. It's babies. Day nurseries for war workers. Every baby we take care of releases a woman for war work and every woman releases a man. My, it's a vicious circle, isn't it? How true. How true. Well, thank you, ladies. It's been a pleasure to have met you. And now I must run along. Oh, yes. Naturally, you ladies will have to go through a few trifling formalities such as investigation by the FBI. And, of course, you'll be fingerprinted. Fingerprinted to diaper babies? Only routine. Don't worry. It's nothing. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. And now you see, girls, we are in society. Do I have to diaper the babies? Well, you might as well get some practice. - I don't know. - Don't know what? Babies on a honeymoon. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Oh, Nano girl, what the matter? Don't tell me you're worried about diapers too. No, the FBI. - They might find out. - Find out what? - That I'm not married. - Not married? But you just told us you were. What's the big idea? How about the flying lieutenant? Didn't you just tell the operator you were Mrs. Tom Dillon? Now wait a minute, it's a sad story and I'll tell it in my own words. Very well, but don't forget your under oath. Proceed. Well, it's like this, Your Honor. - And leave my honor out of it. - Okay, okay. I was born and brung up in Brooklyn, USA. 'I met this here aviator, Tom Dillon' at Mitchel Field, Long Island. He asked me to marry him as soon as he got his advance trainin'. When Arthur married me, he didn't have any advance training. Order in the court, please. - And then what happened? - Somethin' awful. All of a sudden, he gets switched here to Bolling Field. So he tells me to hurry to Washington to marry him this mornin'. I hardly had time to pack me suitcase. Uh-huh. Left you holding the bag, eh? There wasn't no marriage. He got sent to the hospital last night. Oh, Nan. Is it serious? Yeah, he's quarantined with the measles. But the law specifies that it's no crime to scratch a marriage because of measles. Why do you fear the FBI? Well, this year Tom Dillon signed some army papers and put down his name as his wife figurin' we'd be married before the papers got through. Well, I ain't his wife and I can't be till he gets through measlin'. Aha! The corpus delicti. Who's dead? I'm afraid I am. Seriously, kids, what's going to happen if the FBI finds out about all this? Tom might get court-martialed. Oh, here I am as good as married... - Nothing's as good as married. - Listen, squirt. Just because you were hooked up by an ex-prizefighter... He was not an ex-prizefighter. Just because I said that justice was 6'5" and had a crooked nose doesn't mean... That must be Arthur. Coming, darling. Just a minute. Come in, sweetheart. Oh. Can I get my truck now? Well, yes, porter. Do you know where it is? Know where it is? He knows where everything is. Say, I wonder if they have a spare room at the White House. I'm stuck for a place to stay. Oh, we can put you up here if you don't mind sleeping on a cot. - No, she can't. - Porter, we need a cot. Would you bring one up, please? - Yes, ma'am. - But you can't do that. Edna, you have to go and, Nan, you have to go too. Arthur is paying for this suite and he's entitled to some privacy. It's things like these that bring on inflation. Okay, Vi, we'll find something. Don't be ridiculous. We'll stay right here. Oh, no, I can't, Edna. Her Arthur will kill her. Oh, no, he won't because I will kill her first. Well, whose honeymoon is this, anyway? I mean, anyway. Listen, baby, we've helped you out of some jams. Remember that stage manager in Boston? Well, he told me he was single. And if you wanna dig up the past, I can find a few skeletons I met in your closets too. And to think we hoofed together in three shows. I've never known anyone so selfish. Come in. Oh. I hope I'm not intruding. Not at all. Can I do something for you? I'm looking for Mr. Julian Cadman. Well, he's out at the moment, but I'm Mrs. Cadman. Oh. Well, well. - So you're the new Mrs. Cadman. - Mm-hmm. I didn't know his divorce had been made final. - Oh, didn't you? - No, I didn't. - Are you a friend of Julian's? - A very old friend. Mind if I sit down, Mrs. Cadman? Oh, not at all, not at all. Thank you. Edna. Oh, I'm awfully sorry. May I present Mrs. Thomas Dillon? - How do you do, Mrs. Dillon? - How do you do? Uh, excuse me, I didn't catch your name. I'm Mrs. Julian Cadman. Oh, the ex-wife. No. Just the wife. You will note this interlocutory decree was granted August 28 last year. Takes a year for a divorce to become final. Therefore, Julian is not free to remarry until August 28 this year. And today is only the 12th. But we got married last week. How could he make a mistake like that? Julian was always inclined to be a bit premature. So you see, you're not Mrs. Cadman at all. Then what am I? I wouldn't venture to say, Miss... Oh, excuse me, I didn't catch your name. Just what the devil are your plans, Mrs. Cadman? None of your stinking business, Mrs. Dillon. I love your hat. Just a little millionaire back home. Why did you come here, Mrs. Cadman? I came here to tell Julian that I'm going to call off the whole divorce and return to his side as a devoted wife should. - Devoted wife, eh? - Yes. You were anxious enough to get rid of him. That, my dear, was when he was a drug clerk. Whipping up pimento sandwiches in Madison, Wisconsin. But, uh, now that he's in Washington hobnobbing with the big shots, do you blame me? Cute, kid. Julian's pimento sandwiches didn't agree with you but now that he might become a big cheese. Crude, but correct. I'll come back later when Julian's here. So charming to have met you two young ladies. Goodbye. And, thanks, for keeping him amused, Mrs. Cadman. Shall we dance? How do you like that? I feel like a cheap novel in a circulating library. Can she do that? Just call off the divorce? Anytime before the decree is final. Edna, I'm awfully sorry for you. Really I am. I was listening. Yeah, we just discovered Julian had a spare he didn't declare. What I always say is people should be more careful about their dates and things. But don't you worry, kids, I'll stick by you even if you are illegitimate. After all as a married woman, I can chaperone you. But you both gotta find someplace else to stay. Are the hotels like this in Moscow, Natalia? Same thing, only different. In Moscow, everybody talks Russian. Honest, girls, if Arthur finds you here on our wedding night... He'll kill you, so what? Do you want to live forever? Hello. I brought you a visitor from the Soviet Embassy. Oh, Julian, you remember Nan. And this is Vi. - Hello, girls. - Hello. Who's your friend? I am Sgt. Natalia Moskoroff. - The great guerilla fighter. - That's me. I've read about you in the newspapers. - Oh. - Oh, this is my wife. Your wife? Oh. Your wife, you are so happy to meet me. - This is Mrs. Thomas Dillon. - Mrs. Dillon. Oh, beautiful girl. Big, strong. Good for drive tractor, huh? Uh, this is Mrs. Halstead. Mrs. Halstead. Tiny one. Little hands. No good for nothing. Wouldn't you like to take your gun off and sit down? No, thank you. I keep her with me. Take a look at that gun, girls. It's terrific. Get a load of that telescopic sight. You know, Natalia has shot 396 Nazis. Nah. 397. - How wonderful, sergeant. - You think so? My mother has shoot more as 425 Nazis. My mother is best sniper in Russia. Four hundred twenty five. That's marvelous. Oh, she could do better as that. But any day now, she's going for to have baby. - How can she sandwich that in? - It's no trouble. In small village I am coming from we have it there lovely custom. When women is gone for to have baby she tells her husband. How quaint. He's running quick to window with gun for to fire salute three times. One for mother, one for baby and for Joe. - Joe? - Joe Stalin. None for the father. Joe is the father of the country. What for this decoration? This? - I sniped one man. - You kill him? - Oh, boy, do I kill him? - That's good. I have a little message for you, dear. Is anybody sleeping on this tonight? Well, I don't know who you are but you must have the wrong room. No, no. I can't get a room anywhere. I won't be any trouble. I get up early... I'm sorry, but all this space is taken. Could I lie down on it for just five minutes? No, no, you'll have to leave. Hotel Carlton, Hotel Mayflower Smithsonian Institute. You know, I'm getting hungry. I like to eat a fish. - A live one? - Dead. - Cooked? - It's no difference. - Oh, Julian. - Hmm. This is what I want to tell you. Before you got here... Where do you want this, lady? I don't want it at all. Porter, you can just take it back. Put it right over there. But, Edna, you can't do that. You bring another cot. I sleep here too. - What did you say? - Dah. Soviet Embassy where I live is too much people. - It's not so many people here. - Oh, yes, there are. I like better here. I sleep here. But you can't stay here. It's free country, no? I stay here. - But Arthur will kill me. - She'll kill Arthur. - It'll be a round robin. - But wait. Oh, please, pardon the intrusion. Just dropped by to tell you that I phoned the FBI and asked them to expedite matters. Everything will be taken care of before the week's out. Lucky girls. Aha! Gets now more like Soviet Embassy. Gets now more like Union Depot. Hey, if you don't mind, I'd like to listen to the war news. I've got some war news for you too. Shh. 'Thus the Russian that dance on the right flank' 'imperils the elbow of the river' 'which is in reality the left flank' 'of the enemy's opposite flank.' That's Breckenridge Drake. Dear, dear Brecky is such a great analyst. Doesn't know his right flank from his left elbow. '...position makes almost certain the capture' of the great marshalling yard at Pschmitwitz. No, no, he's wrong pronouncing this word. Spells that, P-S-C-H-M-I-T-W-I-T-Z. - How do you pronounce? - Pschmitwitz. Hello, partners. Arthur! Hello, Arthur dear. This is my husband. - Hello. - Hi. - How do you do? - Arthur, I... Vivian, could I, uh, speak to for a moment, please? Uh, what are all these people doing here? Well, they dropped in one after another. I couldn't help myself. That's alright, baby. Just get rid of them fast. Call me as soon as the coast is clear. Uh, excuse me, everybody, important papers. Government business. 'This is Breckenridge Drake saying au revoir...' Arthur's been working so hard. Would you all mind leaving now, hmm? Just a moment, please. 'And now local news.' 'Justice of the Peace, Frank Ellis of Pottsville' 'was found tied and gagged' 'in a closet of his home this morning.' Pottsville. 'The house had been robbed by a man' 'who was described to the police as being about 6'4"' 'with a large, crooked nose.' No! 'According to reports' 'the couple interrupted the thief' 'and in order to avoid discovery' 'he went through the motions of marrying them.' 'Well, that couple are not married.' 'And they'd better hunt up another' 'Justice of the Peace quick.' Oh! Oh! '...dance music is transcribed.' - There goes our chaperone. - Oh! A wedding present from the management, Mrs. Halstead. A wedding cake. Oh, Arthur! - Arthur! - Yes, dear. Now, Miss Brown. The OEW telephoned the DMA that they can't act on that WMP matter until they get an okay from AIBC. And why didn't they get an okay? Because you canceled it, Mr. Slade. I thought so. Always some boneheaded, dim-witted... What? It's a lie! This is the most efficient office in Washington. Tell that to the OEW. I've had enough of this nonsense. 'This is a place of business, you understand.' And I'll get some action around here and know the reason... Why, Vivian. Come in, come in, come in. Well, where have you been all morning? - I finished that letter. - Good girl. Now, Vivian, I don't like secretaries who compose for their bosses. Did you type it just as I dictated it, verbatim? - Oh, no, it's word for word. - It's... Oh. Well, come over here and sit down and make yourself comfortable and, uh, uh read it back to me, will you? General, so and so and so and so. Something, something, regiment. Camp, so and so, Virginia. That's the address, hmm. Dear, general. In reply to yours of the second instant I refer you to my friend Leo P. Smith. Good, good. Further than that, general I can only say, my, my! What a beautiful shade of brown your eyes are. You know, my dear, if you were single and I were ten years younger... Uh, uh, stop. Vivian, would I say that to a general? Well, it did sound kind of funny. Well, naturally. I was saying that to you. Stanley, you were? - Oh, pardon me. - Uh, come in, Halstead. - Come in. Come in, come in. - It's only my secretary. I mean, it's only your wife. I mean, uh, come in. - Hello, Arthur. - Hello. Very clever girl, Vivian. Been here only five days and already, I'm beginning to lean on her. Uh-hmm. So I noticed. Mr. Slade, your lawyer is here. Oh, well, I'll see him in there. Would you excuse me? I'm changing my will. I've found a new way to beat the inheritance tax. I'm leaving everything to the government. Arthur? Aren't you ever gonna speak to me? I have nothing to say. Oh, Arthur, we're supposed to be married. What would people think if they knew you weren't speaking to me? They'd probably think we were married. Well, the only reason I took this job was because I thought it would be good for you. But if you don't marry me it's going to be very bad for you. Very bad for you. What, what, come. What, what, what... Well, an FBI man came up to the hotel this morning and I'm afraid he's gonna look at my fingerprints and find out we're not married. By your fingerprints? Oh, Arthur, you've got to marry me. I can't cope with the FBI. They're much too smart for me. You're just being modest. Let's jump in a taxi and go back to Pottsville. The real Justice of the Peace must be out of the closet by now. Listen. There'll be no wedding bells until you get those three squatters to evacuate my suite. My suite, you understand. Arthur, is that why you're angry? But, darling, the girls all left this morning. That doesn't make any difference. I still insist... What? Well, baby, why didn't you tell me? Uh, oh, uh, Vivian, I... Uh, when you're finished I'd like to have you do something for me. Nan, Edna. Where are you? 'We're out here enjoyin' a sunstroke.' Oh, there you are. Hello, Vi. Hello. Girls, Arthur's coming and you'll have to leave right this minute. We'd look cute walking on Pennsylvania Avenue, like this. I bet we could sell a lot of bonds. But honest, I told him you'd left this morning. Do you want Arthur to think I'm a dope? - He's got a mind of his own. - Well, that is unfair, Nan. You know, I've hardly even seen Arthur. You're beefing? I've so little of my husband they're starting to call me Eleanor. Well, Eleanor. I mean, Edna. You've got to go. Not a chance, pet. Julian's bringing Warren Buckley up for cocktails. I can't go now. Neither can I. Tom phoned they're lifting the quarantine and he's bringing a judge to marry us at 5:00. And if you think I'm walking out on that, you're daft. But Arthur will be here in 20 minutes. - Hello, pie face. - Arthur darling. Hello, baby. Alone at last. Look what I brought to celebrate. Pink champagne. - My favorite color. - Yeah. - What's that? - That? Oh, that's Natalia's mother. Looks more like her father. How'd she end up leaving these things here? Well, she didn't Arthur, you see. She hasn't quite left yet. Oh, Vi darling, I want to... Hello, Arthur. Oh, Vi, I'm borrowing this to wear this evening. It'll look much better on me than it does on you. No, I haven't even worn that one myself yet. If you must borrow something, take the black lace. That thing? Oh, I wouldn't wear that potato sack at Tojo's funeral. But I bought that dress to wear to the peace conference. - The peace conference? - Vivian. I'd like to have a little conference with you. Oh, hello, Arthur. Uh, Vi, dear, I forgot to tell you the manager brought this while you were out. I'm sure Arthur would want to see it. Four hundred and sixty three dollars and forty seven cents! Uh, you'll stay for my wedding, won't you? Girls, you mind if I speak to Vivian alone? Oh, not at all. We can hear everything from in here. - What's wrong, Arthur? - What's wrong? You told me when I got back, you'd have this joint empty. And what do I find? First them. Then that. Now these bills. Vi, I'm through unless you get those dames out of here. It's like a trailer camp. Well, don't lose your temper, Arthur. Four hundred and sixty three dollars and I haven't even slept in the place. Valet service, cleaning and pressing, $46. What do you dames do to get your clothes so dirty? What are you? Commandos? - But, Arthur... - Beauty parlor. $102. - Well, it can't be that much. - There it is written in blood. Shampoos, manicures with wax rinses, facials, mud packs, pedicures. Four permanent waves! I'm supporting four women and I'm still a bachelor! Arthur, darling... Compared to me, Bluebeard was a piker. Sturgeon flown from Barney Smiths pul... in New York. $76. - Who has to have sturgeon? - Natalia. She likes fish. What's the matter with sardines? Add tip, add tip, add tip add... I'm not gonna pay it. But things are so terribly expensive, darling. - There's a war on, you know. - You don't say so? What do you think I'm doing in Washington at a dollar a year? Lobbying for the girdle industry? Well, if you can't see it, I can't explain. - Well, I can't see it. - Then I can't explain it. Well, I can. I'm not gonna pay this bill until this recreation center's evacuated. I don't want it overrun with a bunch of hysterical hags. And get Whistler's grandmother out of here before I lose my appetite. But, Arthur, I tried to get the girls to go. What can I do? You got 'em in, you get 'em out! But, Arthur, aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye? Aren't I your cute, little pie face anymore? Listen, do me a favor, will you? Save that goo for when we're alone if ever. I'm gonna be back here in a half hour. A half hour, mind you in which time I expect you to have this this hen roost emptied of everything but you. Arthur, aren't you gonna marry me? Right now, I just as soon marry him! - What happened? - Yeah. It sounded like the last two minutes of "Gang Busters." Well, he gave me an awful talking to. Oh, that's the best thing men do. - Talk. - Talk, talk, talk. Yattaty, yattaty, yattaty, yattaty. Look, you've got to go, the both of you. If you don't, we'll be thrown out because Arthur won't pay the bill. What? He's got to pay it. He can't move us around like a floating crap game. Hello, you three drupes. What about Natalia? He can't throw her out. She's a guest of the government. I would like a fish. Well, you don't get a fish 'cause Arthur won't stand for it. Arthur, Arthur. How you pamper that man? How much is that bill, anyway? It's $463, that's what it is. It's very easy raise money. Lease lend. No, we can't do that in America, Natalia. No? Funny country. Hello. Sergeant who? Oh, there's no sergeant here. I am sergeant. This for me? Well, all the sergeants I know are men. Hello. Yes, Sergeant Moskoroff speaking. Who is it that speaking on other end? Soviet Embassy. Is Soviet Embassy. Yes..., dear, read it to me. They got their cable from Russia. Never did I was so happy. I got it baby sister. You are wonderful. Baby weighted 9 pounds, 6 chermoulas. - Six chermoulas? - How many red stamps is that? Ay! I must salute mamushka. What are you gonna do? You can't shoot pigeons now. Shh, quiet. Remember our policy. Well, there goes the ballgame. - Who fired those shots? - Me. One for mother, one for baby and one for Franklin D. One of the oldest rules of this hotel is that people who have not paid their bills must not fire guns out the window. - Am I unreasonable? - Mm, no. That seems fair. I believe it comes to some 460 odd dollars. Shall we say, uh, one hour? One hour. Your mother has a baby in Russia and we get thrown out of a hotel in Washington. The shot's heard round the world. Tonight in my village, we'll be dancing in the streets. Tonight in her village, we'll be dancing in the streets. Tonight in our village, we'll be sleeping in the streets. Now don't change the subject. What are we gonna do about the bill? Hello, girls. I brought Mr. Buckley up for a little drink. - Oh, hello, Mr. Buckley. - Mrs. Cadman. Mrs. Halstead and Mrs. Dillon. This is Warren Buckley Coordinator of Essential Commodities. - How do you do, Mr. Buckley? - How do you do? I work for the government too. - Do you know Stanley Slade? - Slade? Oh, yes. Uh, he administrates what I coordinate. - Can I coordinate you a drink? - Huh? Oh, yes, thank you. Make yourself at home, Mr. Buckley. Thank you. Would you like soda or plain water? - Both please. - Both. I, uh, I thought we could talk up little better here than at the office, Mr. Buckley, in more quiet, you know? Yes, yes, very attractive, ahem, uh, room. Here you are, Mr. Buckley. This is very flattering. You're about a businessman in Washington, I guess. Ah, yes. I'm doing the work of ten men. Who are they? That isn't exactly what Mr. Buckley meant, Vivian. Oh, I remember you now, Mr. Buckley. You're the wet wash king. That's right, Mrs. Halstead. Wet wash will win the war. And soybeans. - What's this? - Room service. Did anyone here call room service? I didn't. We didn't ask for room service. 11B, four dinners. Last night! We wanted you last night! You never showed up. The, uh, the waiter seemed a little confused, Mr. Buckley. 'No coordination, Cadman.' 'That's the trouble. No, coordination.' 'Uh, would you care for some more ice?' Stop. - What do you want? - I just wanted to lie down. I haven't slept in two weeks. Well, you can't sleep here, junior. We told you that. I walked all last night through Barney Brook's Park. There was a committee meeting on every bench. - Won't you please get out? - Alright. I'll go back to the men's lounge and get my shoes shined again. Well, the reason I thought we could talk things over better... Hello, girls, forgive me for bursting in like this. But our nursery is terribly overcrowded. And I was wondering if I could leave a few of the babies here for a day or two? Edna. Uh, Warren Buckley. - Just the man I wanted to see. - Hello, Elizabeth. Warren, my babies are very short of teething rings. They've been cutting their teeth on cigarette holders but they are not as good. Could you... I'll see what I can do about it, Elizabeth. Mrs. Cartwright, would you explain to the babies we're busy right now? Oh, I'll just vanish right into thin air. Now, Warren, don't forget my teething rings. I take it you girls haven't heard from the FBI yet? - No. - Well, you will. They're very conscientious. Look, Cadman, don't you think some other time? No, no, Mr. Buckley. We can go out in the terrace. But I'm planning to get married out there. - You can use this room, Julian. - Oh, thanks, Edna. Oh, Natalia. Now we can really talk things over. It's gonna be nice and quiet in here, Mr. Buckley. Buckley, you are the big coordinator, no? Yes. Keep the boats going to Russia. Uh, come right in here, Mr. Buckley. It's friend of my wife. She's a Russian. You know you can't... Natalia, we're very fond of you but you've got to go back to the embassy. Leave my friends when you are in trouble. - No, that's very un-Russian. - Un-Russian. Well, you got us in the trouble with your pistol. Shall we say, uh, 30 minutes? Listen, girls, we've got to do something about paying this bill. Say, I've got an idea. What about those diamonds and ruby clips Arthur gave you? - You mean pawn 'em. - All this nay been in before. Well, I know, but Arthur just took 'em out for our wedding. So what? He can take 'em out again when you get married. Well, I don't know. You swear you'll never tell Arthur? Sure. I always wear them pinned inside because the insurance company promised me a cheaper rate if I kept them in a safe place. Now does anybody know where there's a reliable pawn shop? - I don't. - Neither do I. 1650, J Street. All the way from Russia. Oh, Natalia, you have to go because I have to wait here in case Arthur calls. Huh? - See? - Oh, more decorations. How much you like to got? Last time I got $500, but I had to cry a little. I get you $600, he cries a little. If he don't... Ho-ho! But you can't do that, Natalia. You just can't go around shooting people. Terrific idea. If you owe anybody money, just shoot. Yes, could you arrange to shoot Saks Fifth Avenue for me? Saks Fifth Avenue? - What did he did? - He keeps sending me bills. - Point me him out. - Never mind, Natalia. Now get going and bring home the bacon. No bacon. Is meatless Tuesday. Do you think she'll come back with that money? Either the money or a dead pawn broker. Arthur will kill me. That must be Tom. - Oh, it's you, - Uh, uh, fine, thank you. And you. Yeah. Well, well, well, good afternoon, ladies. - Hello, Vivian. - Hello. How do you do, Mrs. Cadman? Uh, Vivian, I dropped in to pick up that speech. - Speech? - Hmm. Oh, I typed that out and left that with your secretary. My secretary? But I told you... May I use your phone, please? Hello. Vivian, I'm... Uh, give me Main 6034, please. That had nothing to do with my governmental duties. It's a speech I'm going to make at a stag dinner. Hello, Administration of Inter-Bureau Coordination? I'd like to speak to Stanley Slade ple... Um, give me Mr. Slade's office, please. Stanley Slade. S-L-A-D-E. Just red tape, you know, they know very well who... Uh? Oh, yes, there is a Stanley Slade. He... What? Look under livestock? Oh, never mind. - Arthur! - Oh. Well, well, well. Halstead, I'm glad you dropped in. I'd like you to run over to my office and pick up a speech Vivian left there by mistake. You can deliver it to the Bachelor's Club. - Me, sir? - Uh, yes, sir. You, sir. Well, sir, suppose I'd phone or have a messenger boy do it, huh? No, you'd better do it, Halstead. It's an important speech. But, Mr. Slade, I wanted to speak to Vivian. - Eh? - Uh, sir. Uh, don't worry about her, you leave Vivian to me. But, sir, I... Yes, sir. Oh, dear. Now, Vivian, can you give me a little time? Take some vacation perhaps, hmm? - Yes, Stanley. - Hmm. If that's for me, there is no Stanley Slade. Hello. Yes. Will I? You wait and see. In two minutes, well, hurry up, darling. That's Tom. He's coming over with Judge Franklin. - Yeah, am I in the way? - Oh, no, Stanley. - Oh. - Uh, Mr. Slade. Will you and Vi work out on the terrace? - Nobody will disturb you there. - What about my ceremony? It'll be just as binding in here, dear. Well, that's fine. Fine. Come, Vivian. Is there very much to do, Stanley? You know with our taking off a stitch we get a bigger crowd than Gypsy Rose Lee. I think I'll get married here. There's something homey about a fireplace. You better got those shotguns out of the way first. They give the wrong impression. I'll take it. Oh, if that's the groom he must have called from downstairs. May I see Julian, please? Julian? Why, whatever made you think he is here? Tsk, tsk, suspicious mind. - Haven't seen Julian for days. - Well, then may I... Darling, will you make another drink for Mr. Buckley? He's... Oh. - Hello, Sylvia. - Hello, Julian. Well, what do you know? Where are you living, Julian? Because I'm moving in. At the Potomac Bears, rooms for men only. You wanna move in there? Well, my place will be rather cramped for both of us. I'm living in a hole on the wall. Oh, and how are the other termites? Pardon me. Look, Sylvia. There's one thing we've gotta get settled. The two of us aren't going to live anywhere. Oh, no? I wonder if the government would do business with a man accused of bigamy. Well, umm, don't even talk like that. You know a scandal at this time would ruin me. Can't you be reasonable? Alright. I'll make you a sporting proposition. Either I go back with you or you come back with me. - Oh, now, look, Sylvia... - You got lost, Cadman? Oh, excuse me. Uh, be right with you, Mr. Buckley. Just one minute. - Is that Warren Buckley? - Yes, it is. Look, Sylvia, we can talk the whole thing over later in the lobby. You don't wanna crab my deal with him, do you? Of course not. What's good for you is good for me. And if you know what's good for you you won't keep me waiting in that lobby. You'll remind my husband, won't you, dear? Edna, I'm afraid this is where you get off. That dame has a priority. Well, I've gotta get back to Buckley. We'll figure out some way to get rid of Sylvia. I know! Oh, no, you can't get that stuff without a prescription. Well, your married life was exciting, but very brief. Yeah. Could pass me like a P-38. Zut! - Here I am, baby. Fill these. - Tom! Contact. - You must be Edna. - Hi, Tom. Uh, may I present Judge Franklin my best man Lt. Kerry? This is Mrs. Cadman and this is... Well, I want you to call her name. May I offer my congratulations? Thank you, judge. Oh, Tom, is this the bridal bouquet? Yeah, I hope it fits. Judge, could we get started right away? Uh, alright, my boy. Uh, may I see the license? The license? Oh, yes, I put it right over here. I wanted to make sure not to lose it, that's why... Say, this isn't bad. Quite a place you've got here. Edna, what did you do with the license? What did I do? I haven't touched it. Well, you saw me put it right here. It couldn't walk away, I... Vivian. She's always hiding things. - I'll ask her. - Oh, someday, I'm gonna... Look, dear, I don't like to keep the judge waiting. Pardon me, Mr. Slade. Vi, where did you put Nan's marriage license? - I didn't put it anyplace. - Are you sure? - She left it in the desk. - Well, it must be there. I'll be right back, Stanley. Think up some good sentences. Alright, Vivian. Yeah. Take it easy, Tom. They'll find it. The most important piece of paper you've ever owned! Nan, I'm surprised, leaving your license in such a public place. Well, paper is usually kept in the icebox? Why, I can't imagine what could've happened. Ah, you know I showed it to you last week. Sure, remember, a sheet of paper about so big with printing on one side. - Words on it? - I don't know. - 'What's the matter?' - That piece of paper! Well, what about it? Well, the boy came for the laundry this morning and I had to make out a laundry list on something and we were all out of stationery, so... Oh, no! You made out a laundry list on the back of my marriage license? But if you don't make out a list you know how the laundry loses things. Oh, Vi! Well, it's your own fault for leaving it around like that. How can I marry you without a license? I don't know, judge! Hello? Hello, valet service, please. Darling, I certainly never expected to... Uh, hello. This is 11B. Could you return our laundry right away? Yes, the dirty laundry! We're alright. Judge, they'll send it up in a jiffy. - Oh, thank heavens for that. - Well, that's better. Now, lieutenant, if you're in a hurry... Julian! Oh, Julian! - Julian! - Yes, what is it? Come on out. Nan's gonna get married. Well, well, from measles to matrimony, eh, lieutenant? Yes, but this time, he'll be quarantined for life. Judge, you better cut your ceremony down to a telegram. Lieutenant, if you and the bride will take your places. Over by the fireplace, please. Oh, Nan, don't forget this. Thank you, darling. # Bum bum bum bum bum be da rum ## That's enough of that. - Ah! The license! - I'll get it! You phoned for your laundry, ma'am? Oh, yes. Bring it right in. It was sent out at noon, ma'am but you'll have it back without fail in five days. - We hope. - 'Five days?' I'll be somewhere in the Pacific day after tomorrow. - What? - Well, I just got my orders. Honey, I was gonna tell you later. - Oh, Tom! - No license? Well, I'm afraid that changes things a bit. But you know we have a license. At this point, I don't quite know what I know. Please, judge, I'll go to the laundry personally. I'll have that license back tomorrow morning. But the lieutenant won't be here tomorrow morning. Well, couldn't you date it ahead a couple of days? Young lady, this is a wedding ceremony, not a check! Uh, uh, Vivian. Uh, you're keeping your government waiting. Who's that? If there's anything I can do to coordinate matters... Who in blazes are you? That's Warren Buckley and I'll thank you not to speak to him like that! What's he doing at my wedding? It isn't a wedding yet! You're a fine one to talk! You stay out of this. - Arthur! - Now what's goin' on? You're just in time, darling. Nan and Tom are getting married. - Oh, well, congratulations. - Thanks. This is my husband, Judge Franklin. How do you do? Now what about the laundry? You see what a mess you've made up? Are you satisfied? Well, how was I to know that Vi would lose the license? - Am I psychic? - You don't have to be psychic. Look at her, she's the type that loses things. Just a minute! I'll do the insulting around here. Thank you, darling, and anyway, I didn't hurt your old license. I only wrote on the back of it. 'I begged you to let me keep that license' but, no, you had to have it, you were gonna sleep with it under your pillow and think of me! Now don't start that again. It's fine for you, hop off to the Pacific or Corsica or someplace with bands playing and flags waving! All the excitement and glamour! But what about me? I have to sit home on my ottoman listening to Lum and Abner and Phil Spitalny! How do you like that, judge? Children, children, this must not be. If I can only be sure you actually obtained this license. Of course, they did, I can vouch for that. And so can my husband. Can't you, Julian? - Hmm? Oh, yes, yes! - So can my husband and I. We can vouch too. Well, in that case, I'm going to relax a rule. Will you take your places again? - Oh, thank you, judge. - Thank you, judge. You don't know what this means to me. We can't have a wedding without a little music! # Vum vi da lo # Vum vi da lo vum va da di # Vivian, I got it! Six hundred fifty dollars and here is pawning ticket. - Natalia! - For the love of Pete! Pawn ticket? What pawn ticket? - Uh, can't we go ahead, judge? - Yes, please. Natalia, Nan's getting married. Dah, get married? In Russia, we have it custom. Natalia! - May I go ahead now? - Just a second. This may be a funny time to bring this up but what did you pawn? Arthur, there's a wedding going on. What did you pawn? And answer carefully, because if you tell me you put those clips in again, I'll never marry you. - What? - Now be patient, judge. - Arthur. - Well, here we go. I beg your pardon. Uh, you and your husband are not married? No, and we're not going to be! I'm takin' those clips out for the last time! And that goes for you too! Arthur! Six hundred fifty bucks and he is yelling louder than the pawn breaker! - I don't got it. - Can't we continue, judge? Well, some of these people who have vouched for you hardly seem to be... Am I intruding? You certainly are! Who are you? Me? I'm Mrs. Julian Cadman and I've come to call for my husband. Your husband? And as the sun slowly sets over the horizon we wave farewell to beautiful Bermuda. Now, Sylvia, this is uncalled for. Judge, couldn't we just go out in the hall and get married? But I thought that this lady, uh... You mean to tell me that you two aren't married either? So sorry. - Did I speak out of turn? - Where's my hat? Oh, judge, you're not walking out on us. We've got to get married! You've got to get married? Everybody in this room has got to get married! So you're supposed to be in love with me. A fine bunch of sponsors you picked out! Well, if you're so bright, why don't you do something about it? I am, I'm going to the Pacific where I can have a little peace and quiet! Come on, Harry! - Tom! - I'm sorry, ma'am. Tom! - What will I do? - Can I help it? I seem to be causing no end of trouble. Don't you take all the credit. However, I'll get right out. If I'm not mistaken, you're, uh, Mr. Buckley, aren't you? Well, I, uh, I think I am, but right now, I, uh... - Julian. - Oh, uh... - Mr. Buckley, this is my wife. - Your wife? - But I thought... - No. This is my wife from now on. Oh. Oh, yes, I think I, uh... How do you do, Mrs. Cadman? So I've finally met the famous Warren Buckley. Shall we have tea down in the lounge? - Just the three of us? - Gladly. - Julian? - Gladly. I patronize your branch at home, Mr. Buckley. What a clever idea, having people call for their own laundry. - How did you ever think of it? - Oh, I don't know. How did Edison think of electricity? You're wonderful. I'll call you later, honey. Natalia, I think I got a little job for you. Well, that's that. Would you jolly spinsters care to split a bottle of arsenic with me? - I can use it. - So can I. I try a little of this too. I'm sorry, ladies, but your hour is up. Oh, no, it isn't because we've got the money. Here. Now, whee, took a powder. Uh, thank you, but I've already rented the suite to Mr. Breckenridge Drake the great radio news analyst. 'Don't drop that typewriter, for heaven's sake.' 'Don't bump that tiger's head.' 'I shot it myself, the poor thing.' Ah, it's wonderful to be home again. Well, the place hasn't changed a bit, Jordan. That's what you think. The ladies will be out of your way in a few minutes, Mr. Drake. A few minutes? But you can't throw us out like this. We haven't even packed! I gave you due notice. But that isn't fair, Mr. Jordan. We won't have any place to sleep. - Sorry, ladies, but I dist... - Now hold on, Jordan. Let's analyze this thing. I see no reason why these young ladies should be compelled to retreat. Locating quarters in this area is a major problem. But the ladies have overstayed their time, Mr. Drake. Suppose you just withdraw, Jordan. - You irk me. - He what? Irks. Oh. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Now, ladies, I shall require one of these bedrooms and you may share the other. And I shall also do my broadcasting in this room. Uh, boys, will you please put Mr. Drake's things in there? Oh, Mr. Drake, you're a duck. That reminds me. I would like a fish. I'll only be here a very short while then it's off to the wars again. Duty calls me. There are many great battles to be won and I want to get back in action again. Oh, did you just come back from the front, Mr. Drake? Yes, I've just made a tour of the Kaiser Shipyards. There's nothing more important in the home front, you know. Now if you'll excuse me, ladies, I'm going to think. What's this? All the clothes just came back ladies, the laundry couldn't take 'em. Is all that ours? Ye Gods! We're dirty. The stuff from the whole hotel got mixed up in the truck. You'll just have to pick yours out. Well, have at it, girls. Start pickin'. Be careful, my marriage license is in here someplace. What color is it? I hope they didn't lose my last pair of nylons. 'This waste of time.' In Moscow, whosoever laundry you get it, you wear it! I'll bet he's a romantic kid. Hello, girls. Surprise! I brought you some of my little darlings. Come in, girls! Careful now, don't crowd. Just spread 'em over there on the davenport. Careful. Don't jostle the little dears. Oh, aren't they adorable and so good-natured? And now you could have your first lesson in child care while we're at it. Well, well, well. What have we here? A madhouse! Brecky, what a charming coincidence. Uh, don't think me rude, but what are you doing here? We're sanitary engineers, lady. But we don't need a plumber. Leave us be the judge of that, doll. Come on, bright eyes. Uh, pardon me, um, are you Breckenridge Drake? Yes, I am, but I'm very busy. Gee, I've been listening to you on the air for many months, Mr. Drake. Oh, thank you very much. And I came all the way to Washington just to do one thing. - Yes, what is that? - This. Can't we have a little action around here? # Rock-a-bye baby! Uh-oh, here comes Mr. Jordan. The all-American pest. - Uh, good morning, Mr. Jordan. - Good morning. I wonder if I might speak to you ladies quite frankly. Of course, Mr. Jordan, we were just saying how sweet you've been. The word is patient. When you took over the bridal suite, it was to be occupied by your husband and yourself. In some mysterious way however, Mr. Halstead has disappeared and has been replaced by you ladies. To say nothing of your houseguest the Russian Sergeant York but, uh, who is going to pay the bill? But we've already given you an awful lot of money, Mr. Jordan. That was more than a month ago and... Oh, what about Mr. Drake? Mr. Breckenridge Drake is sharing the suite and naturally paying his part of the cost. Well, you'll be paid, Mr. Jordan. Here is your bill. It must be taken care of today. And don't try to remove your luggage. Do they do that in a first-class hotel, keep your luggage? You've got me, I've never been thrown out of a first-class hotel. Testing, A-B-C, testing, A-B-C... As I have predicted exclusively time and again the Allied Armed Force which appears weak is actually... We'll have to close that window once we're go on the air... which, although they appear strong are actually weak... They are in full fight, which after all is the same as being trapped except that they are going in a different direction! Okay, Mr. Drake, we're going out for a cup of coffee. We'll be back in time for the broadcast. Oh, hello, girls, I was just rehearsing my broadcast. Brecky, you were wonderful. So clear that even poor little me knows just what the situation is in the Pacific. Uh, thank you, but I was discussing operations in the European theater. You were? Well, that's just splendid. What I always say is, there's been too much talk about the war and not enough about the theater. Well, ladies, I'm leaving you today immediately after my broadcast. I must away to the wars. To the Kaiser Shipyards again? No. Far more hazardous this time. I'm off... to Lockheed. You've been a darling, Brecky, and we'll never forget you. To make sure that you don't I have a little souvenir for each one of you. - Brecky! - One moment. I hope he gives us something we can pawn. No, it will probably be an autographed picture of himself autographing pictures. Well, well, little man. - What now? - Is that for us? With the compliments of Mr. Jordan. - Jordan did you say? - Yes, ma'am. He hopes you ladies are enjoying your stay here in Washington. - Oh. - Now you see. Mr. Jordan is sorry. Well, here you are, you lucky girls! A few of my most precious trinkets. This is an epaulet from a Japanese officer's uniform. Oh, thank you, Mr. Drake. And for you, a piece of wood from the stern of the first Liberty ship. - And you're giving it to me? - I want you to have it. - And for you, Vivian. - Yes, Brecky? My stamp collection, the work of over 20 years. I didn't know you save stamps. I'd have given you some. I've been throwing them away. Well, ladies, I think it's safe to predict that I shall see you again before I go but now I must go to my room for 40 winks. I always sleep a half an hour before my broadcasts. I would get part of the stern. Now who do I know with one shoulder? Say, these stamps aren't worth anything. They've all been canceled. I wanna call Arthur. I thought Slade sent him out of town. - He's due back today. - Haven't you any pride? - I don't care, I love him. - Now wait a minute, Vi. Let's decide what you're gonna say before you call him. Yes, because if you're going to make the first move you'd better say the right thing or you're through. Oh. I wanna talk to Arthur Halstead at the Central YMCA. Will you call me? I know what I'm gonna say. I'm gonna be very sweet. I'm gonna say, Hello, Arthur dear. Why haven't you called me? And if he says he's been busy, then I'll say. Well, nobody's too busy to call and see how a person feels. Then he should say I'm sorry. But if he doesn't say I'm sorry, then I'll say. Well, a person could rot in this hotel for all you care. And then if he doesn't say anything, I'll say. Well, maybe you don't care how I feel, maybe there's somebody else about whom you care how she feels. And then if he doesn't say anything, I'll say hmph! It didn't take you long to find somebody else. Who is she? Then if he still doesn't say anything, I'll say. Well, I'll find out who she is. You've got somebody! Then I know what he's gonna say, he's gonna say I'm jealous and if he does, I'll tell him a thing or two. I'll say I might've known when you wouldn't take my clips out again that you had somebody else. Well, you can just stick to her! Hello, Arthur, you can go straight out and jump in the lake, I never wanna see you again as long as I live! - How do you like that? - Well, what did he say? He said hello. You were perfectly right. Darned if I'd let any man say hello to me over the telephone. 'Well, hello!' - I want a fish. - What happened to you? Where were you all last night? - I take walk. - A walk? Where? Some city, is on the Baltic. - On the Baltic? - Da. Baltimore, I walked to Baltimore and back. - What's the matter with Duke? - Oh, he couldn't took it. I got to rest his feet in double feature. - You went to a movie? - Two movies. Was "Watch On the Rhine" and "Destination Tokyo." Kills there plenty Nazis. Oh, apples. You mean to tell me you walked all night? Is not so much. One vacation, I walk from Minsk to Omsk to Pinsk, then back to Minsk. Hello? Arthur! - It's on again. - I didn't mean a word of it. Sometimes I just don't know what I'm saying. Honest. She's telling him. Yes, Arthur, I'm alone. Why? She's alone! Shh! You are? Now? Oh, yes, Arthur, I'll be right here. Yes, Arthur. Yes, Arthur. 'Yes, Arthur. Alright, Arthur.' Anyone we know? Now who can that be with Arthur coming? No watermelons. - Well, good morning, Vivian. - Hello, Stanley. - I wasn't expecting you. - Uh, thank you. Um, good morning, good morning. Well, and how are you this morning? I am exhausting. I think I lay down. Hmm, uh, uh, Vivian, uh... Would you hold that for me? Thank you. Vivian, could I speak to you alone for a few moments? Well, I haven't much time. I'm expect... - But this is rather important. - Oh. Wrong room. Vivian, the FBI cannot find any trace of your marriage to Arthur Halstead. - They can't? - No. And furthermore, both Mrs. Dillon and Mrs. Cadman have registered for government work and the FBI is slightly upset about them too. That's what the FBI get for being so nosy. Um, uh, yes. Now, Vivian, I, I don't like the idea of the FBI coming around, asking me questions about you. I don't like it all. Besides, they might find out about me. Might find out what about you? I have a floating kidney. - You have? - Yes, I have. I got it in '29 when Columbia gas went down to 7. Seven? Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Of course, as an administrator, I won't have to use it for anything, but still... Nobody will ever know, Stanley. Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. But the point is, what am I going to tell the FBI about you? But, Stanley, you believe Arthur and I are married, don't you? No, Vivian, I don't and I never have. - You don't? - No. Then what kind of a woman do you think I am? You're an adorable woman. You're a beautiful woman. I love you, Vivian. I love you and I want to marry you myself. But, Stanley, you can't talk to me like this. And you mustn't stay here. Arthur's due back in a minute. Oh, forget Arthur. You know very well I love you. I, look, I've been running around for days with this. Uh, uh, oh, here it is. I was afraid to give this to you but now I'm no longer afraid. - Oh, Stanley. - There you are. Oh! Oh, I can't. I absolutely can't, I... Oh, Stanley, it's a dream. - Y-you like it? - Like it? I... This is the most heartbreaking thing I've ever had to do. Yeah, now w-wait, wait, wait, you mustn't take it off. - No, I wished it on. - You did? Yes, and if you take it off it will bring us both very bad luck. - It will? - Mm. Oh, that's terrible because I've still got two years to go on a mirror I broke. Oh, let me share those two bad years with you and all the years to come. Oh, Stanley, I... Hello, Arthur dear. From the very moment, Vivian, I saw you, I... Well, well, well, Halstead, I see you're back. Yeah, would you mind taking your knife out of it? - Uh, uh, yes, y-yes... - Thank you. Now, see here, Halstead, I have every reason to believe that you and Vivian are not married. - You have, sir? - Yes, I have, sir. It's those snoopy FBI people. If you're really married, I owe you an apology. - You're forgiven. - Vivian, please. And if you're not married, and I'm pretty sure you're not I have just given Vivian a ring. - Oh, you have, sir? - Yes, I have, sir. Did you accept the ring from him? Well, I wanted to give it back to him, but he wished it on. Ha! Wished it on. Where do you get off giving Vivian a ring? But, Arthur, it's only 3 carats. - Uh, 4 carats. - I don't care what it is. First, you send me away on a phony trip and... Ah, get out of here before I throw you out. But don't, Arthur, he's got a floating kidney. And you took a ring from a guy with a floating kidney? Please leave my kidneys alone! Both of you. I'm leaving now, Halstead. But you haven't heard the last of this and I'm not kidney... I mean, kidding. Good day. Now you take that ring off. Arthur, I'm only wearing it around the house. Are you gonna take it off? But I wanna show it to Edna and Nan. - They never get anything. - Oh! I should have known you didn't give a hoot about me when you pawned those clips. But if you gave a hoot about me, you'd take them out again. All the way over here, I knew this wasn't gonna work. Arthur Halstead, do you mean to tell me just because I'm wearing this little teensy ring for a few minutes... Oh! Well, I was gonna take it off, but now I won't. After all, a person has some pride. That's the one thing we agree about. Arthur! I can always tell when Arthur leaves. He's such a gentle soul. What happened this time? Arthur is just impossible. He's so touchy. All on account of a teensy little ring. - What teensy little ring? - Stanley gave it to me. - Let's see it. - Oh. - And he objected to that? - Arthur's over-critical. He said I didn't love him anymore. I wouldn't have put the clips in again. But I do love him and I'll prove it. I'll get the clips out. I don't know how, but I... Oh, I know. I'll get them out by putting the ring in. The outstanding intellect of our time. - Natalia. - Oh. Come here, Natalia, I wanna talk to you. I have sleep like dead horse all through 26 battles but here with you three dames, it's murder. Natalia, I've got a job for you. - Saks Fifth Avenue? - No, the pawn shop. Now here's what I want you to do. Put the ring in, take the clips out. Put the ring in, take the clips out. - I don't got it. - Listen. # Put the ring in take the clips out # Ha-ha! # Put the ring in take the clips out # # Yes... # Put the ring in take the clips out # # Yes... # Put the ring in take the clips out # # Ra ra ra ra # Ra ra ra ra # Put the ring in # Put the ring in # Take the clips out # Take the clips out # Ra ra ra ra # Ra ra ra ra # Put the ring in # Put the ring in # Take the clips out # Take the clips out # Put the ring in # Put the ring in # Take the clips out # Take the clips out # Ra ra ra ra # Ra ra ra ra # Put the ring in # Put the ring in # Take the clips out # Take the clips out # Put the ring in take the clips out # # Put the ring in take the clips out # # Put the ring in take the clips out ## Whoo! - Hello, Mr. Buckley. - Hello. Have you seen Mr. Cadman's son? Yes, sir. He's in the steam room. Thank you. That's you, Cadman? - Yes, who's that? Mr. Buckley? - Yes, Cadman. They said I'd find you here. I, uh... I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. Not my soybean process? No, your process is okay. My bad news is of a deeper nature. Brace yourself, old man. Keep cool. I, uh... I'm cool. What is it, Mr. Buckley? Cadman, I'm in love with your ex-wife, Sylvia. She has promised to become Mrs. Warren Buckley. Oh, but you, b-b-but... Did you say my ex-wife? I persuaded her to let your divorce become final three weeks ago. We wanted to tell you ever since, but... Well, I lacked the courage until just now. I knew what a blow it would be. Oh. Oh! Oh! There, there, old man. Don't take it so hard. It's just one of those things. 'Mr. Buckley, you don't know what a thing it is.' You don't know what this means to me. Let me have the privilege of shaking your hand. Hmm. Huh? Oh, I'm goin'. Alright, I'm goin'. Yes. - What did Buckley just say? - Shh! I could hear if you'd only stop talking a minute. Oh! The pen, the pen, where's the pen? Did you have to knock us down? Don't sit there and argue. Where's the pen? - It's over there! - Julian's gonna marry Buckley. I mean, Buckley's gonna marry Sylvia because the beans are in her bag. I mean, Buckley's full of beans! What are you raving about? Sylvia's got Buckley, Buckley's stuckley aren't we lucky? Edna's so excited, she doesn't even make sensely. Here you are, Mr. Buckley. Ah, young lady. Thank you. The pen, as the French would say, cherchez le plume. Dear ladies, do you know why I'm taking Julian's process? Because I pride myself that I have always known how to judge men. - Oh. Excuse me. - 'Oh, hello, Stanley.' How do you do? How do you do? How do you do, ladies? Uh, how do you do, Mr. Buckley? Uh, I won't be a minute, I, uh, left something up here with my secretary. Uh, Vivian, I've been doing some very serious thinking. If you'll return that little, uh, circular thing I gave you, I'll be right on my way. Oh, must you have it today? Uh, yes. I'd like to have it at once. Well, that's gonna be kind of hard to do. May I ask why? I, um, I sent it out to be cleaned. Oh, well, then... Cleaned? Yes, it had a big, black spot on it. Uh, uh, Vivian, are we talking about the same thing? - I mean those, uh, carats. - Yes, those 3. Uh, 4, um... Could we talk this over in another room? Uh, well, yes, of course, Stanley. Uh, thank you. Will you excuse me? It's, uh, official business. Uh, thank you. Now if you'll ask my judgment of him I'd say there is a solid citizen. A man who gets what he goes after. Contract's okay, Julian? I'm on the last page, Mr. Buckley. Hello, Nan, is, uh, Vivian here? Oh, hello, Arthur. Oh, why, Arthur, come in! Uh, Arthur, you remember Julian and Mr. Buckley, don't you? - Oh, yes, hello! - Hello, hi. Uh, where's Vivian, in her room? Um, yes, she is, but she's, uh, sort of busy now. She's, uh, uh, taking a bath. Vivian, you're all washed up. 'And remember, if I don't get my carats back' you'll be a mighty sorry little lady. Oh! Hello there, Halstead, I... Arthur! Arthur! I seem to have come at a rather bad time. Yeah, one time's as good as another. You know that Slade disappointed me? First time I've ever been wrong about a man. A fellow in his position should be calm, unruffled no matter what happens. - Yes. - How you coming there? I just signed my life away, Mr. Buckley. Then here goes. Let's make history. Come in. I have a message for you, Mr. Buckley. - Thank you, thank you. - Yes, sir. Is my department organized or isn't it? They're gonna locate me at any hour no matter where I am. - Well, I'll be... - Anything wrong, Warren? Those miserable two-faced double-crossers. I knew they were out to get me. - Get you? - I'm fired. I'm not the coordinator anymore. Now wait a minute. Does that mean our whole deal is off? What do you think, you big lug? - Was that Arthur? - No, it wasn't Arthur. I'll go and see what I can do. Maybe there's been a mistake. What happened? Buckley blew his job and that leaves Julian out in the cold. Well, it's nice and warm out on the terrace. Come in. Good morning. You can't sit down, you can't take a nap on the sofa we don't know you and we don't want any more trouble so please get out. - Vivian Marsden. - What? - 'Uh, Nan Curtiss.' - Yes. Edna Stokes. My name is Walsh, Federal Bureau of Investigation. Thank goodness, I thought it was the FBI. It is, dope. Now I won't take up much of your time, ladies, I uh... - 'Mr. Walsh?' - Yes. Didn't I meet you at the party just last week? - No. - I didn't? No, and you're not going to meet me at a party next week either. Hmm. You three are a little rich for our blood. We've had about eight operatives checking on you girls. Two of them have been listed as parachute jumpers and another one is having a nervous breakdown. So we figured that to free the department for other work if you girls would sort of start packing. Packing? Now there's a lovely train leaves here at 1 o'clock and I have priorities on three parlor chairs. Compliments of the United States government. Just what are we charged with? Oh, now let's not go into that. That's what got us crazy. We've successfully rounded up spies saboteurs, blackmailers and kidnappers. But the case of the three groomless brides has us slightly bewildered. Uh, 1'o clock and if there are any questions I'll be waiting in the corridor. Well, I can think of one question. - What do we do next? - That's easy. We pack. You know, girls, I've been thinking there must be some easier way to get married. Ay! 'Hey!' Uh-oh, here comes Buffalo Billsky. Look your eyes on those. The ring, the clips and $6 left over. Thanks, Natalia. He's great pawn breaker but terrible pinochle player. I treat to the dinners, huh. No dinners, toots. We're being thrown out. Of the hotel? First the hotel, then Washington. Nan, will you unbutton me, please? Pardon me, is there anyone else here? Yes, what can I do for you? Oh, I, I must apologize for coming in this way, I... Oh, just a moment. Hey, hey, wake up, wake up, wake up. Yeah, wake up, wake up, hm-mmm. Hey, hey, hey, wake up. Yeah, alright, mm-mmm, sure. Wake up. Will you, please, wake up? Come on wake up, please. Yeah, yeah, get out. A-alright, I... Alright. Oh, yes. Look, what is this? It's been over a month. Haven't you finished your business in Washington yet? Yes, I finished two weeks ago. Then why don't you go back home? I can't get a train out. - Excuse me, mister, uh... - Uh, Forbes. - Forbes. - Forbes. Why, of course, you're Howard Forbes. Aren't you the president's secretary? - That's right. - Well, I am delighted. My name's Cadman, Julian Cadman. Oh, yes, the soybean man. - The president's secretary? - Yes. Uh, this is my, uh... Miss Stokes. Well, Mr. Forbes, were you, uh, looking for me? Why, no, I'm looking for Mrs. Thomas Dillon. For, Mrs... Huh? Oh, oh, Nan. Nan, come on out here. This is Mrs. Dillon. This is Mr. Forbes, the president's secretary. Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Dillon? I've come to extend an invitation for luncheon. You are to be the guest of the president and Mrs. Roosevelt at the White house. Hmm. Oh, oh, thank you very much but I couldn't possibly have luncheon with... President Roosevelt? Are you sure you have the right Mrs. Dillon? Oh, quite sure, your husband, Lieutenant Dillon is with the president now. Tom? In America? He arrived this morning. No, no. You'll learn all the details at luncheon and you'll also have the pleasure of pinning a decoration on him. Oh! We'll send an escort for both of you. - One o'clock. - An escort for both of us? Oh, yes, Lieutenant Dillon said he'd rush over here as soon as he was excused. - Goodbye. - Oh! I'll see you to the elevator, Mr. Forbes. Tell me, how is the president these days? Busy? What's the matter with her? Who was that man that just came in? Nan's having lunch at the White House with the president. I suppose so. You better finish your packing. No, honest, Vi. Tom's back. - He is? - Hey, what do you think? I got an appointment with Forbes tomorrow. Somebody much bigger than Buckley is interested in my process. - Oh, Julian. - I've got to get married. I'm not gonna be introduced to the president as Mrs. Thomas Dillon until I am Mrs. Thomas Dillon. You're right. Julian, you got to dig up a minister somewhere. But it's quarter to 1:00 now. 12 minutes to 1:00. How am I gonna find a minister so fast? What about a Notary Republic? There's one in the lobby. A friend you're needing, the friend in deeding. - I get you minister. - In 12 minutes? In more lesser time, it's done. I better try too. Just to make sure. Nan, if you can get Mr. Roosevelt aside will you tell him I'm one of his biggest fans? Yes, I will, Vivian. He was great in "Yankee Doodle Dandy." - Nan baby. - Tom darling. Come on, let's give them a break. That's more than anybody ever did for Arthur and me. Tom, you look wonderful. - Darling, your hand? - Oh, that, I... I sprained that shaking hands with generals. Mm-hmm, and, uh, how did you become a big hero? Oh, you don't wanna hear about that now. Oh, yes, I do. Please, Tom. - Tell me all about it. - Well, it was like this. The day after Harry and I got to the island... - Harry? - Mmm. You remember Lieutenant Kerry my best man the day we didn't get married? Well, we were out on patrol and all of a sudden we're tailed by 47 Zeros. Forty seven? Why, I counted two of them myself. Well, of course, we were badly outnumbered so we decided to set our plane down on a Jap-infested jungle. It was a dark and stormy night. Suddenly, I lost Harry. Then I lost my nerve. I could hear the enemy all around me. I got so panicky I started to yell. Harry, Harry Kerry. - Harry Kerry... - And? Two hundred Japs jumped off the cliff. Oh, no! Look, time's up. Aren't you two bored with each other yet? May I be the second to congratulate you? Thank you very much. As one war worker to another I think you should be kissed. Mrs. Thomas Dillon. Oh, Tom, you shouldn't have. I didn't do it. Mr. and Mrs. Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Mr. and Mrs. Franklin Delano Ro... May I see that, please? Just sort of forget that I came in here. This is the screwiest case I ever saw. Hello... Meet Father Nicolai. I happen to remember every Saturday noontime he's coming downstairs to get shave. He never gets it. - Can he marry us? - Why not? Well, here you all are waiting to hear my broadcast. - How very nice of you all. - Oh, we forgot about him. Well, you can still get married out on the terrace. Hey, kids, look what I found in the lobby. - Arthur, Arthur darling. - Hmph. Don't be angry. I promise I'll never see Stanley Slade again. Neither will I. He just fired me. And believe me, Vivian, if... The clips? - No more pawn brokers? - Never again. From now on, I'll go to the bank. They got lots of money. You pie face. If that's the way you feel, why not make it a triple wedding? - Oh, what are we waiting for? - Yeah, let's do it, shall we? We're on the air in about 80 seconds... Alright, alright, thank you. Quiet, boys, take down the trophies. We gotta get this over with. Father Nicolai says to stand around him. Make a group. - That's group. - Uh, honey, uh... And the brides, all on the left. "In conclusion, friends, thus we find that today three great new battles have begun." Goodbye now. This is Breckenridge Drake covering the battle branch from Washington, D.C. This is station WIL... # La la la la la... # Well, well, well, girls, it's nice to have known you. I'm off to the wars again. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Drakey. - Uh, Lieutenant Dillon. - 'Yes.' - Your escort reporting. - Thanks, lieutenant. - You're ready, Nan? - Oh, wait, my bag. - See you later, kids. - Goodbye. Come on, kids, why don't you ride over with us? - Shall we? - Why not? It will be fun. - Why not? It'll be fun. - See you later, Julian. Lunch with the president, this America. You know, I like it here. - So long, Viv. - Oh, Edna. Edna, what about your luggage? What'll I do? Do nothing till you hear from me. - My great big hubby. - This is it, baby. I can really carry you across that threshold now. # Da di da da da dat # Alone at last. Arthur!
