[BARKING] -[SQUEAKING] -[BARKING] -[BARKING] -I'll get it. [LAUGHING] [GASPING] [BARKING] Whoa! What's that? Come on! Let's check it out. It's so beautiful. [WHIMPERING] And shiny. MOM: Marzipan! Marzipan! In a minute, Mom! Huh? Wait. What just happened? MOM: Marzipan? Come on, Luula. [BARKING] Mom! I saw something amazing in the woods. It was this... sparkle-thingy. A sparkle-thingy, huh? It was so pretty. It all was like... [MAKING WHOOSHING SOUNDS] What do you think it was? I don't know. Maybe it was a giant firefly? Or... Or a really slow meteor, that was like, "I'm crashing to Earth, but in my own time." Well, whatever it was, why don't you play in the village today, just to be safe? Mom... I'm all grown up. I'm like two feet tall. And I'll never, ever get used to it. Have a great day, sugar plum. [BARKING] [GROWLS PLAYFULLY] [LAUGHING] We love you too, Luula. Have fun at work. You're gonna make a great... Assistant Workshop Manager of Elf Operations and Toy Distribution... Whatever that is. Aww. Thanks. Let's hope my boss agrees with you. BOSS: Walk with me, Cinnameg. You've gotta keep up, if you're going to be my new manager. Got it, Mr. Starsnaps. And please, call me Crumble. Will do, sir. I have a lot of exciting ideas to help improve the workshop. Improve the workshop? Why? Everything is fine just the way it is. But we haven't made enough toys, and Christmas is only a week away. Already? Huh. I missed that somehow. Eh, calendar schmalendar! It always works out in the end. Morning, Estrellastar. How's Santa's List coming along? We're in the groove, Crumble. Are we checking it twice? Always! [DINGING] [SPUTTERING AND POPPING] See? Everything's fine. [CHILDREN GIGGLING] Whoa! [LAUGHING] You wanna play? Here you go! Come and get it. -[GASPING] -[BARKING] -[LAUGHING] -[BARKING] [GASPING] Twelve Lords a-Leaping! Luula! Cathedral Cavern! There's that sparkle again! -[GIGGLING] -Hey! Hey! Did you see that bright light? Anyone? Anyone? Am I talking to myself here? [BARKING] We gotta find out what it is. Come on, Luula! CRUMBLE: Attention, everyone! Attention! Apparently, there are only seven days left before Christmas. [CHEERING] I know. Time flies, right? [SIGHING] Anyway, we're a gumdrop behind schedule. [GROANING] Hit me! We're gonna have fun, eat cookies, and keep making toys with heart! [CHEERING] See how I handled that? There's no low elf-esteem in my workshop. [CHUCKLING] You get it? [LAUGHING] Oh, I kill me! Crumble, I love your confidence - and your jokes - but those are things the elves were already doing. We need to modernize. You know, like the reindeer did! Okay, I have that report back on the status of the sleigh polish. It's looking really good right now. Looks like we've got a weather alert in Sector 5. Zoom in. Roger, Donner. Zooming. Optimizing Antler Radar. CUPID: It's a snowstorm, and it's headed our way. Great work, team. High hoof. Don't leave me hanging. We don't need any of that fancy-fangled reindeer modernization around here. For us elves, Christmas is about one thing... heart!

Hi, llamacorns! You're looking extra pepperminty this morning! [BLEATING] Hello, Winter Wishes Moose! Merry almost Christmas! Hmm. You, too! Hi, Gingerbread bunnies! "Grizzly Gap"? I've never been here before. [GASPING] Luula, look! The sparkle is still there! Let's go! Hey, Boss, I know you're on a cookie break, but got a moment? Sure do. What's up? I've been crunching the numbers on my Elfpad and this toy shortage is worse than I thought. We don't have enough trains, or dolls, or puzzles, and don't even get me started about the robots. Yes! Hey, Edgar, you want a cookie? Go long! Oh! Ah! Oh! Agh! [CRASHING] Nice catch! Cinnameg, what's this? Heart. And what is every toy in Santa's workshop made with? I see where you're going with this, and I'm not trying to get rid of the heart. I love heart. I'm, like, the captain of team heart! I just want to make sure we have enough toys for Christmas. I've been doing this for a 129 years and we've always had enough toys. I even got a pin for it. What's that say? CINNAMEG: "Chief Workshop Manager". That's right. So, stop worrying. You're in the North Pole. Chill out! [CHUCKLING] Heart you! Good talk. [WHIMPERING] I don't know if I like this place either, Luula. [WOLVES HOWLING IN DISTANCE] [WHIMPERING] Now, I definitely don't like it! [WHIMPERING] Ahh! Oh, thank tinsel. It's just an owl. Um, hi, Mr. Owl? Can you help us? We're looking for a mystical sparkly thing. Hoot-hoot! One more time. A little slower. Hoot. Hoot. Oh. Okay. I've really gotta learn how to speak owl. No, no, no, no, no! [SIGHING] Well, Luula, we should probably head back. It's getting late. Huh? What's that? [GASPING] Wait! [SNORING] Is that you, sparkle thingy? -[SNORING] -[WHIMPERING] And why do I hear snoring? Ahh! -[BARKING] -You're not a sparkle! [BARKING] [BARKING] You're a... bear! [GROWLING] Luula, don't move. We don't want to look like prey. Not that kind of pray. Although, it couldn't hurt. [BLOWING RASPBERRY, MUTTERING] It's not working. Uh... look fierce. [GROWLING] -[BARKING] -[MARZIPAN GROWLING] Feel my tickle power, you giant bear. [STRAINING] Take... Take that, Mr. Bear! And that! And here's under the armpit! Ooh, yeah, this should do it. Tickle, tickle, tickle. [STRAINING] Oh, right under the foot. [PANTING] Yeah, it's a weak spot. [GROWLING] What are you doing? I'm defending myself. From what? From you. You're Grizzly da Bear. Everyone says you're really mean. No offense. Uh, none taken. You know, you elves have been giving me a bad rap for years. And yes, I admit, I... have a temper. I may have pulled one or two Christmas trees out of the ground because they were blocking my view. That was you? But I gave all that up years ago. Yeah, I'm a good grizzly now. Although, I still run with the wrong pack of wolves on occasion. You know, a bear's gotta have some fun, you know what I mean? [WHIMPERING] Kind of. I'm saying there's a lot more to me than meets the eye, like right now I'm hibernating, or at least I'm trying to. Ah, something's been stuck in my hide. Haven't gotten any sleep in a month. Want me to look? No, I got it. [WHIMPERING] [CHUCKLING] You clearly don't. Let me help you. Why would you help me? Because I'm an elf; it's what we do. Now, stand still. Oh, it's only a little thorn. I'll get it. No! Ow! Ow! Ow! I... didn't touch you yet. Yeah, but-- but you're gonna. On a count of three. One... two... Ahh! Ow! MARZIPAN: Done. You big bear cub. Whoa. Look at the size of that thing. It could have punctured something. You're welcome. Oh, thank you. Anyway, if you're done making noise out here, I, uh... I gotta get some sleep. Capisce? Wait! Mr. da Bear? You haven't seen a magical sparkle, have you? No. And if I haven't seen something in the North Pole, it don't exist, kid. Good luck, though. If you need anything, my friends call me 'Grizz'. You know where to find me. [RUMBLING] [WOLVES HOWLING] Um, I think it's time we made our way back home. [BARKING] [SAGE] Okay, Elflings, snuggle up. It's time for your bedtime story. And tonight, we're going to read about how reindeer learned to fly. [OOHING AND AHHING] [DOOR OPENING] Oh, my elf! You're never gonna believe what happened! Marzipan, there you are. Sage Evergreen, I saw this amazing sparkle today, and it looked kind of like that. Really? Well, then you're going to enjoy this story very much. Now, where were we? At the beginning! Oh, yes. "A long time ago, in a village much like this one - because it was this one - there's a very special snow deer named... Glisten. She was made of pure stardust and could fly as fast as a shooting star." Whoa! That's so fast! My dad says that shooting stars can go like fifty billion miles an hour. Sounds scientifically accurate. Anyway... "One day, Glisten sprinkled stardust on the elves' garden. And when Santa's reindeer ate the corn on Christmas Eve, they could fly." [Elfling 1] What the...? [Elfling 2] This is different. "And every year after that, Glisten led Santa's sleigh, so they could deliver toys all around the world. And when children saw her, she sparkled with Christmas spirit." Green garland! That's the sparkle I saw. I saw Glisten! [DOOR CLOSING] Hi, I'm home! Mom! Hi, sugarplum. Guess what? I saw Glisten, the snow deer! That's impossible. Glisten vanished years ago. Uh, you ruined the end of my story. -[GROANING] -Oh, man! Sorry. It's okay. We'll read another one tomorrow. Come on, time for slumber noggins, everyone. Let's go. -Sweet dreams. -BOTH: Good night. But why did Glisten go away? No one knows for sure. But, according to the story, Glisten disappeared because people stopped believing in her. Oh. So, maybe you have to believe in Glisten before you can really see her. It's certainly possible. Okay, sugarplum, off to bed. -I love you. -Love you, too. Good night. Good night, Sage Evergreen. Thank you, Sage. [SIGHING] What a day. You know, Marzipan has a point. Maybe, sometimes, you do have to believe in something before you can see it. I know this much: there's no way we're going to get all those toys made in time for Christmas. Oh, no. Not enough toys for Christmas? Luula, we've got to help Mom. Cinnameg, have faith. I guess. Believing is the first step to making a dream come true. Do you see anything between us right now? Uh, no. Well, I do. Love. Remember, just because you can't see something doesn't mean it's not there. [SIGHING] I miss you, Jinglestar. Cinnameg, now that we're engaged, I want you to have this: the double-star amulet. It sparkles when you believe in the spirit of Christmas. I'll always believe, as long as you're by my side. [CLOCK TICKING] [BELLS CHIMING] [TRUMPETING] BOTH: Six days until Christmas! Ah, sir? Sir, could you look at this, please? All right, let's tighten that up. Merry morning everyone! You needed me? There's a storm headed to the North Pole. It's a few days away, but it looks bad. How bad? See for your elf. Hop for your lives! Ahh! [YELPING] Oh, crumpled wrapping paper! We've got to launch Santa's sleigh before that storm hits, which is impossible because I don't have enough toys. What's with Crumble not taking any of your ideas? Every time I make a suggestion, he starts elf-splaining to me about having heart. Well, you know elves, they love lots of heart... and lots of dancing. Crumble! What's going on? We're having a bit of a jig break. But there's only six days till Christmas! Come on, it's fun! Ahh! What about the toys? Can't help it, Cinnameg. When the music gets ya, ya gotta give in! Ahh! This is why I didn't become a dancer. [STRAINING] Whoa! Whoa! Whoo! But what if something else goes wrong? It's Christmas! Chill out. [ALARM BLARING] -[GASPING] -Oh, no! Holy holly, that's the alarm. What's happening? Oh, no! Help! The Nice Machine is being very naughty! ELF [OVER P.A.:] Emergency! Code Red Suit! I repeat, emergency! Code Red Suit! Don't panic, elf-ybody. Don't panic... [SCREAMING] And that's how you draw a snow deer. Now, let's see your drawings. -[ALARM BLARING] -ELF [OVER P.A.:] Emergency! Code Red Suit! I repeat, emergency! Code red suit! [GASPING] -[ELVES SCREAMING] -[ALARM BLARING] -Oh, no! -Help! -Mom! -[ELVES SCREAMING] [ALARM BLARING] [BELCHING] Excuse you. That wasn't me. What do we do? What do we do?! You're the boss. We gotta shut it down. But how? I don't know. Nothing's ever gone wrong in the workshop before. There's a switch! On the wall! Come on! [SCREAMING] Hurry! I'm about to get checked twice! Aah! It's got me, too! -[STRAINING] -Mom! I'll save you! Marzipan, stay there. We've got this. Don't got this! Definitely don't got this! This machine is not nice! Turn it off! I'm coming! [GRUNTING] Aah! Paper cut! Paper cut! So many paper cuts! Phew. Made it. [STRAINING] But... I can't reach. I know! Luula! [BARKING] Woo-hoo! Phew! Yay! Marzipan, that was elf-mazing! But never do it again. The machine was jammed. That's why it's been so glitchy. All these extra names were stuck inside. Oh, no! So, now, we have to make even more toys? What? We can't do that. That's impossible. Don't panic. We'll... We'll figure something out. I'm panicking. [BREATHING HEAVILY] I'm definitely panicking. Remember what Albert Elfstein said: "We can't solve problems with the same thinking that we used to create them." Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're... You're right. You're right, it's all good, as good as a gumdrop, good as a golden goose. At least Santa's not here. Ho-ho-ho, everyone. ALL: Santa! Ahh! Calendars? Toys?! Nice kids?! Lists? [BREATHING HEAVILY] Cinnameg, I think it's time for you to be in charge of the workshop. Oh! Um, okay. Everyone, Cinnameg is now the official Chief Workshop Manager. Um, what just happened? I think you just got promoted... again! -Congratulations, Cinnameg. -[APPLAUSE] I'll see you in my office immediately. Ugh... I need a cookie. Well, well, well, Cinnameg. CINNAMEG: I don't know what to do. We don't have enough toys, and there's this big storm coming. Hmm, hmm, hmm... Cinnameg, do you know about the tradition of the pickle? There's a pickle tradition? Yes. Very popular in Germany... and all the best sandwich shops. [LAUGHING] You see, on Christmas Eve, a pickle is hidden on the Christmas tree, and whoever finds it, gets an extra present. So, the pickle isn't just a pickle; it's a gift. It is? The nice machine broke, and that created a pickle. But then, you got promoted, so it's also a gift. I have faith you'll be able to get us out of all our pickles. You really think so? Because it's going to take a miracle for Christmas to happen this year. Mom needs help making toys, and there's only one bear big enough for that job. We need Grizz! -Come on! -[BARKING] [BLEATING] Hello again, llamacorns! [BLEATING] Merry, merry, almost, almost Christmas! What's up, Gingerbread bunnies? Aww. Love you more. We made it, Luula: Grizzly Gap! Oh! Hoot hoot! Hi, Mr. Owl. Have you seen Grizz? Hoot. I have no idea what he said. -We need our map. -[BARKING] This looks familiar. Grizz? Grizz? Are you here? Snore once if you can hear me! Grizz! [RUMBLING] Hey, please tell me this is some sort of bad dream. Nope. It's real. [SIGHING] I'm really sorry to wake you up. I don't believe you. It's just... my mom's in trouble, and there's this storm coming, and Glisten is gone! Are you still stuck on this thing? It's, uh, your eyes playing tricks on you. You said you'd help me, and that's why I'm here. I didn't mean that. It's... It's like when you say, uh, "How you doing?" But you don't really want to know, you know? Why would you do that? Ah, never mind. What's up, huh? Spill it. The elves need help making toys for Christmas. Christmas, huh? Yeah, I ain't never had one. Tinsel on a tree! You've never celebrated Christmas? Wow, you really are loud. As for Christmas, no, okay? I haven't had one. Um... First, I'm usually asleep. But mostly because, you know, I'm naughty, or at least that's what the elves think... and the bunnies, llamacorns, of course, owls, most other birds, Christmas trees, if they could talk. Anyway, you get the point, right? There it is: no Christmas presents for naughty, naughty Grizz. This is not okay. Now, you have to come to Santa's workshop. No thanks. But, Grizz... I'm on the naughty list, kid. The world sees me as a big, scary, naughty predator. But you're not. I know that, and you know that, but they don't know that. [WHIMPERING] But we need your help. Please? Forget it. Not happening. I'll be your best friend. Please? Please? Please? Please? Please? Please? Please? Please? Please? Please? Please? Please? -No, no, no, no, no. -Please? Please? Please? -Infinity. -Please? Please? Please? -No backsies. -Please?! Please?! Fine, I'll go. But you're lucky I have sensitive ears. Yay! You're gonna love Christmas, I promise. Okay, that's never happening again. Now, let's go before I change my mind. [GINGER BUNNIES SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [BLEATING] Attention, everyone! Attention! I found someone to help make all our toys. It's my new best friend. Drumroll, please. [BELL RINGING] Mm, close enough. Grizzly da Bear! Hey. [GASPING] [GROANING] Hmm. That went better than expected. Say hello, everyone. Don't be shy. Grizz has given up his winter 'hy-bear-nation' to help us out! Yo, what's up? How you doing? Don't worry. I really want to know this time. So, I, uh, hear you elves make a mean cup of hot toffee. I could sure use a pick me up, and then... badda bang! [SCREAMING] That means I'll be ready to work. Oh, um, good... good to know. [STOMACH GROWLING] Sorry, I, uh, skipped lunch. Uh, will someone get this bear some cookies, so he doesn't get hungry for an elf-sized snack? I'll help. -On it! -Me too! Edgar, you and Grizz have a lot in common. -We do? -Yes. You already love Christmas, and Grizz is going to love Christmas. -Cool. -Cool. Here's your snack. [SNIFFING] Please don't eat me. Wow, that's a mean cup of toffee. Thanks, Pal. Oh! Sorry! I'm okay. So, uh, how can I help? [MUSIC TINKLING] [ROARING] Um, that one's broken. Let's find a different way to help. How about video game testing? [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] [ROARING] [GROWLING] [BEEPING, CRACKLING] Or building doll houses. That thing's like a bear trap with curtains. MARZIPAN: Or roller skates. Ahh! Why would you make standing on two legs harder? Ahh! Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. I think we figured it out, Grizz. -Wow! -ALL: Wow. Thanks for the talk, Santa. Christmas is about believing, Cinnameg. It's about finding our faith when difficult things happen. It's about the pickle. I'll never forget it. And delivering toys is what helps keep the Christmas spirit alive. It's our Merry Mission. Santa, Marzipan thinks she saw Glisten. Is it really possible? Hmm, hmm, hmm... That's a good question. Glisten is made of stardust and faith, like all of us. Her magic comes from the spirit of Christmas. When our belief is strong, so are Glisten's powers, and that's when we can see her. And when the spirit of Christmas is strongest, the wishing star and the star of Christmas will align. My husband gave me an amulet with those stars on it a long time ago. Maybe it's not a coincidence. Now, go find that pickle, Chief. Will do, sir. I don't know why I'm saluting right now. [HUMMING] Grizz! You're doing great. [DOOR CLOSING] Amazing, actually. Who would have thought? We're building toys with the help of Grizzly da Bear - the notorious and scariest bear in the North Pole, who is on the naughty list! Ahh! What did you just say? -Oh. -[GASPING] Really, huh? Uh... That's still all I am to you, just some... naughty list grizzly bear from the woods, huh? [GROWLING] Grizz, try to stay positive. He's been working on his anger management. [GROWLING, ROARING] [YELPING] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] No, I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean it! [SCREAMING] Wait! Don't go! I have a temper, but I'm working on it. Grizz, it's okay. Look at me. We can fix this. [SCREAMING] Grizzly da Bear! [ALARM BLARING] What's that? Zoom in. [ALARM BLARING] What the...? Emergency! Code Red Suit! I repeat, emergency! Code Red Suit! Okay, this is gonna be harder to fix. [GROWLING] Grizz, wait! [ALARM BLARING] -[GRIZZ GROWLING] -[GASPING] [ALARM BLARING] Oh no. What now? [SCREAMING] Grizz, please! Wait! [SCREAMING] [ALARM BLARING] I thought they would accept you, like I did. I'm so sorry. No crying. And what did I say about hugs? Look, it's probably not your fault. I'm Grizzly da Bear, and that means... I'll always be on the naughty list. Not to me. Thanks. See ya around, kid. And it felt good to help, even if it was only for a little while. Oh, Luula... [WHIMPERING] Marzipan! Sugarplum! Are you okay? Are you hurt? [SIGHING] Mom, I'm fine. Thank elfness. What were you doing bringing Grizzly da Bear to the workshop? He's nice! That naughty stuff isn't even true. Honey, you have a big heart, but, sometimes, there are things we can't change. I thought Christmas was about being kind, even to mean old grizzly bears. Shouldn't that count for something? Marzipan, your mom and I know you were just trying to help, but how in the glacier did you meet a bear? I met him when I was looking for Glisten. Do you think Glisten's real? As real as the magic of Christmas. Remember, you never know what can happen when you truly believe. Well Jinglestar, I might be the first workshop manager in history to not deliver toys on Christmas. Ugh, I don't know why I'm telling you all this. Or if you can even hear me. [SIGHING] [CLOCK TICKING] [BELLS CHIMING] [KEYTAR PLAYING] BOTH: Five days until Christmas! Okay, everyone, how are we gonna save Christmas? Don't look at us. It's not our fault there's not enough toys. Here we go again. "The elves did this, the elves did that. "The elves used my antlers as a coat hanger." Uh, it's getting old. Everyone focus. We need to solve this before Santa gets here. Ho-ho-ho. Every Christmas has a story, but they're all about believing. So, here I am! Wow me. You got it, Santa! That's what I'm talking about. [CHATTERING] [SIGHING] If we're making all these extra toys, shouldn't we make enough for everyone? Even if they were naughty? -[GASPING] -What? -[GASPING] -That's not tradition! I know, but just because someone was naughty once, doesn't mean they're not good. Now, that's wowing me. Okay. So, if everyone gets a toy, then, let's see... Uh, maybe we can make enough toys, if we automate production. But... But what? We can only make one kind of toy. One kind of toy?! For every girl and boy? Hear me out. It could be a gift that every kid would love. Like what? I know! Carrots. No, no, corn! They love corn. Stick to the weather, flyboy. SANTA: Hm, hm, hm. Yes, Cinnameg may have just solved the pickle. In all my Christmases, there's one toy everyone loves - boys, girls, young and old, all over the world! Well? Are you going to tell us what it is? Oh, yes, of course. It's... a teddy bear. CRUMBLE: What? Santa's right. Everyone deserves a good bear in their life. Where's the heart? Elves can't make billions of bears with no heart. We'll never make gifts without heart. Love is why we make the toys. They'll always be filled with the spirit of Christmas. It's our Merry Mission. That reminds me of a story. Long ago, when I decided to dedicate my life to Christmas, I told Mrs. Claus my plans. And the next morning, she gave me the most wonderful present: a tiny heart... ...so her love would be with me forever. Wait a minute. What if we put a heart like that in each bear? Then, the elves can make a holiday wish on the heart, so children know the teddy bears were made with love. Marzipan, you are on fire today, like a Yule log. Let's do it! Okay, you heard the man. All hands and hooves on deck. It's teddy bears with heart for everyone! -MARZIPAN: Woo-hoo! -CRUMBLE: Nice job.

[LAUGHING] Elf-gratulations, everyone! Woo-hoo! Wow. Look at what you did. I can't say I'm surprised. After all, I taught you everything you know. You sure it's gonna work? It has to work.

Oh, my mistletoe. Phew. Glad I'm not in charge. -Launch is a no-go. -[GASPING] We're too dang heavy with all these teddy bears. I gotta think. [SIGHING] Why can't anything be easy? Don't suppose you know where to find another flying reindeer? Glisten. But does she even exist? I have to believe. Come on, Luula. Hurry! [BLEATING] [BLEATING] [SLOW MOTION:] Whoa. Whoa! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! I say, quite a storm we're having, isn't it? Hoot! Wait. Now you can talk? I've been brushing up on my elfish. Hoot! Ahh! My map! Hoo-hoo! Okay. Fine. I'll get there myself... somehow. Pull. -Pull. -Come on, team! -[STRAINING] -DONNER: Pull. BLITZEN: Put your backs into it! DONNER: Harder. Pull. -[STRAINING] -Everybody together now. BLITZEN: It's going to make it... [WHEEZING] Cinnameg, there's no way to get this sleigh off the ground without removing some teddy bears. That's not an option. Those children are counting on us. Wait a minute. Where's Marzipan? Umm. I haven't seen her since... I asked you if you knew any other flying reindeer. Oh, no. She's looking for Glisten. In this weather? CINNAMEG: I gotta find her. Need a ride? I'll get you some snow shoes. I don't need no stinkin' snow shoes! I'm a flying reindeer. Cinnameg, what's happening? Marzipan's missing. I'm going to get her. Remember what I told you. Have faith! You'll need it. Thank you. Just keep believing, Cinnameg. I'll try, Santa. She has to be here. This is the end of the map. I don't want to judge, but if I was a magical snow deer, I'd hang out in a much less scary cave. [BARKING] DASHER: I don't like what I'm seeing. Can we get a read on that? Let's get the light strips out there. I don't like the look of that storm. Oh, it's big, and Donner and Cinnameg are heading straight for it. [STRAINING] Oh! There it is! With any luck, we can beat her there! But I'm gonna have to fly real low to get out of these clouds. [STRAINING] We made it! [WHINING] [CRACKING] Oh... So, this is Cathedral Cavern. Okay. Now, I get why Glisten hangs out here. Glisten? Are you in here? Glisten? [WHIMPERING] There you are! And... you have friends. [GROWLING] ...who are growling at me. [GROWLING] This is not good. [BARKING] The storm's getting worse. We gotta pull Donner and Cinnameg back! Donner, the storm has gone from bad to coal. Return to base. No can do, Cupid. Oh, I'm so glad I'm not a giraffe. [WOLVES GROWLING] Okay, wolves. Just one question before I run for my life. [GROWLING] You haven't seen a sparkly snow deer, have you? [GROWLING] Didn't think so. Bye! Ah! [SNARLING] [WOLVES SNARLING] -[WOLVES YELPING] -[GRIZZ ROARING] Grizz! How did you know I was here? You have no idea how loud you are, do you? Wait. Grizz? As in Grizzly da Bear? What's up, pups? How ya doing? Ah, you know, just having fun and being naughty. Looks like we might have a Christmas feast tonight. Wanna join, Grizz? Come soon, Glisten. I believe in you. Sorry. She's with me. Really? [GROWLING] [GROWLING] Too bad for you, because it's winter and we are hangry. Too bad for you, because I'm nice now. -Nice? -Yeah, but I'm still all grizzly about it. [ROARING] [SNARLING] [GROWLING] [GROWLING] [GRIZZ GRUNTING] [SNARLING] Grizz! [SNARLING] [GRUNTING] How you like that? -[YELPING] -Or that? -[GROWLING] -Ah! [SNARLING] [GASPS] Ah! That's it, straight ahead! On it. Ah! Aw, dang flab it. We're in a vortex. Hold on. [SNARLING] GRIZZ: Ah! Ah! [GROWLING] [BARKING] [WOLF SNARLING] Ah! [SNARLING] [ROARING] [BARKING] [GROWLING] Ah! -[YELPING] -[GRIZZ GRUNTING] [YELPING] Run! [PANTING] [GASPING] [CRACKING] Grizz, stop! It's going to break! But this is the only way out. What else are we gonna do? Uh... We let them get closer. Closer? Just do what I do. [GROWLING] Come on, wolves! Is that all you got? [WOLVES GROWLING] [BARKING] Ah! [BARKING] -Oh, I get it now. -[MARZIPAN SCREAMING] -[ROARING] -[MARZIPAN SCREAMING] [SNARLING] [BARKING] [SNARLING] -[SCREAMING] -[BARKING] [ROARING] [GROWLING] Avalanche! Run for cover! Now! Whoa! No! No, no, no, no! -[WOLVES HOWLING] -[GASPING] Grizz! [WOLVES HOWLING] [BARKING] Grizz! Hold on! Don't worry about me, kid. I got this. Come on, Marzipan. Believe. I know you can do it. [ECHOING] I know you can do it. [ECHOING] I know you can... [GRUNTING] I'm coming for you, Grizz! SAGE EVERGREEN: Believe. I know you can do it. I know you can do it. I know you can do it. I believe. [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [SIGHING] Okay. I believe. I believe I can do this. [WHIMPERING] Ah! Whoa! Whoa! Pull up! Pull up! On it. Marzipan, stop! [GRUNTING] I'm fine. Ah! [GRUNTING] Can't do it. We're going down. -We're going down. -Ah! [BEEPING] -COMET: Oh, no. -BLITZEN: What? COMET: We lost Donner. He's gone. Donner, Donner, do you read me? Donner, are you there? Ah! -Ah! -[WHIMPERING] [GASPING] Ah! [ECHOING] Ah, I can't look. [GASPING] Woo-hoo! [LAUGHING] You can look, Grizz. You can look. Glisten saved me! Whoa. You're real? [WHIMPERING, GRUNTING] Hey, watch out for those antlers. Gentle, gentle. Whoa. Close one. Are you okay, Grizz? Me? Never better. Now, don't you have Christmas to save? Get out of here, kid. -[BARKING] -Come on, Luula. Let's go save Christmas! Ho, ho, holy star. She did it. Marzipan did it! Yahoo! Now, that's one good elf. Woo-hoo! Come on, Donner. Work with me here. My amulet. It's glowing. What's that? My daughter. Come on! Hi, Mom! Marzipan, hang on tight! Fly, Glisten, fly! -I got Donner! -[CROWD CHEERING] He's back! And there's someone with him! Yes! [LAUGHING] We're back. [LAUGHING] Donner? Is that you? It sure is, and Glisten. Prep the launch pad. This Merry Mission is on. [CHEERING, LAUGHING] Woo-hoo! Let's go, everybody. It's game time. We have three hours until Christmas. Move out! DASHER: Opening launch bay doors. [BUZZING] Are you seeing what I'm seeing? All the time. SANTA: Glisten, it's you. I always knew you'd be here when we needed you most. I believe. It's good to see you again. It's good to be seen, Santa. Mom! I love you so much. I love you, sugarplum. And this is Glisten. I see that. Thank you so much. It was Marzipan's faith that brought me back. You have the true spirit of Christmas in your heart. She gets it from her father. And I hope I get it from her. We got to go. Glisten, tonight is all you. Take the lead. Goodbye for now, Marzipan. Thank you for believing in me. Thank you to all of you. Hold on tight. I like to fly fast. Launching in ten, nine-- Uh, uh, blast off? Whoa-ho-ho! Merry Christmas! [cheering] Did I miss anything? And why is Edgar covered in glitter? Grizz! You're here! If I'm allowed to be. Of course you are! From now on, you're always welcome in Christmas Village. Aw. Can we get in on this hug? SAGE EVERGREEN: Me, too. Oh, you're so soft. And musky. Thanks. Now, I finally get why they call it a bear hug. [GRUNTING] Well, I guess now that the crisis is over, you can have this back. Oh, no. After all that's happened, I'm pleased to announce that you are the permanent Chief Workshop Manager... of everything! Are you serious? Do I ever joke around? Wait. Forget I said that. Mom, you did it! Thank you, Crumble, and as my first official act as chief, I'd like to make you our Ambassador of Cookies, Dancing, and... Heart. I promise to do my best. And, um, don't we have a little something for Grizz around here somewhere? Yes, we do. GRIZZ: A Christmas present for me? Everyone deserves a good bear in their life. [SNIFFLING] Grizz, are you crying? No, no. Uh, a snowflake got in my eye. [SNIFFLING] Now-- now, get out of here and go sing a Christmas carol or something and, uh, not a mushy one. [SNIFFLING] MARZIPAN: Merry Christmas, everyone, and to all an elf night!
