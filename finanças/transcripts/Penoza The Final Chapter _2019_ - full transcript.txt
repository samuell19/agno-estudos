THE PRESS CALLS TO CARMEN Carmen. TV: The infamous drug queen Carmen van Walraven is back on her own soil. Everyone thought she was dead, but we knew better. We never gave up on the search. TV: She grew up in a criminal family in Amsterdam. After the death of her husband, she took charge and worked with the Zetas cartel. That unleashed a drug war in the capital. Previous attempts to lock her up have failed. Public prosecutor Justine de Heer was after her for years... ... but went to jail for attempted murder and concealment of evidence. Jack van Zon was probably also involved... ... in the laundering of Van Walraven's drug money. He's been in for kidnapping and murder for four years. He has never hidden his obsession with the Widow. Van Walraven is in police custody... ... and Van Zanten is convinced that they can sentence her to life imprisonment. Thank you. JIM: Could I? Yes. Excuse. Do you think this puppet show will help? - We have her, Jim. We just shouldn't let her go. Otherwise all your work will have been in vain. Then she wins. Do you want that? This is your second chance. Carmen is not retarded. Until now we can't get anything to stick to her. Because she's careful. We have no witnesses, no evidence, nothing. So we need a confession. Get it. What is her weak spot? If anyone knows, it's you. Walk. MAN: I have a visual view of the suspect. What are you doing? I don't say anything without my lawyer. - You just have to listen. My boss wants a full confession. About everything. Your business, the cartel shipments... ...the murders. On Schiller. Uncles. Speedy. El Amarillo. The coach. Everything. They want the truth. - That's bullshit. Your boss wants a show. Nothing has changed. Turn it around. What do you want? Did you miss them? While they didn't know you were still alive? do you know what i think I think they really want to see you. That they missed you very much. And that they want nothing more than to hold you. Do you really think... I can arrange it. When I make a confession. Asshole. I want to go back to my cell. Carmen. And your kids? I determine the conditions. Where, how, how long. And not like that. I want to go back to my cell. Now. There are no suspicious activities in the outdoor area. About. HELICOPTER WHEELS That's not really necessary, is it? Boy. Bunch of pedos. Be careful, my hair.

She often babysits when I am in the gallery. I am so glad you are painting again. And not on the wall of your room now. - No. We don't have time for this. No, you shouldn't have brought them with you now. - Yes, yes. Yes. How is Zoë feeling? She's starting to feel a little nauseous. - Then it will be a girl, it has to be. Come on, the clock is ticking.

POLICE SIRENS Fuck off. You are vultures. LUCIEN: Get on with those cunt cameras. POLICE SIRENS WHISKED MUSHROOM Okay. And now: El Amarillo. Head piece of the Zetas cartel. He passed away on October 11, 2015 at your daughter's restaurant, RAAF. Mrs. Van Walraven, the sound recordings of that operation have unfortunately disappeared. And Mrs. De Heer's statement is... Well, let's say... flawed. What exactly happened that night? What happened to El Amarillo? Mrs. Van Walraven? Um... It's very simple: I shot him. Yes, you say that to all of them. Do you really think we believe the entire organization was made up of you? I didn't need anyone else. Mrs. De Heer stated that, in addition to Jack van Zon, your son Boris was also present. What is his part in the incident? Nothing. But when Mrs. De Heer came in, he was gone. We're here for Mrs. Van Walraven, not her son. Mr. Lawyer, the officer has the floor. Mrs. Sir wanted to cover up the matter... Sir. - And the murder of El Amarillo... ... took place under her responsibility. That is not our focus. - Not your focus? Mrs. Van Walraven. A few days later Justine wanted to shoot me. That is also not important? Those two fools are trapped by me. PEOPLE YOUR JUSTINE OUT Not because of your brilliant detective work. GEGNIFFEL Mrs. Van Walraven, will you please sit down? CARMEN ZUCHT - Thank you. Well, more tomorrow. Thanks. - It's your show, not mine. You did very well.

Do you know who your father is? Say goodbye to Dad. THE WOMAN IS CRYING: Paul. What a sweetheart. What beautiful children. A father should watch his daughters grow up, right? Well... Then listen to me carefully. BUZZER HUTTED VOICE: What couldn't wait until tomorrow? SHE TURNS ON THE MICROPHONE What couldn't wait until tomorrow? What happened? The Black Widow is still alive. Of course you wonder who I am, but that doesn't matter now. What's important is that you have to do three things. Three assignments. If you do everything on time, nothing will happen to your family. If you pass this on to anyone, especially the police... ... I'll have to kill them one by one. Am I clear? Good. As for your first assignment. I want to see fresh blood on your hands. It is very simple. Kill your witness tomorrow. MUTED: I make a confession. IN THE MICROPHONE: Which witness? - I had to make an urgent request. I can't say anything else. Sorry.

JUDGE: As a witness, you should tell the truth and nothing but the truth. I promise. Your presence is at the request of Ms Van Walraven's lawyer... ... to clarify your involvement in the murder of El Amarillo. Mr. Lawyer, your witness. WHISPERING: What am I supposed to do? HE CLEARS HIS THROAT Mrs. De Heer. Can you clarify the night of October 11, 2015? There were audio recordings. They have been miraculously lost. And Jack van Zon has been keeping his mouth shut about this night for years. He refuses to cooperate on... ... any research. JIMMY: Die. LAWYER: You conducted the investigation. You led the arrest team. It was your operation and El Amarillo has been exe... She killed him. End of story. Carmen van Walraven is a drug dealer and murderer. And I hope with all my heart that you'll put this woman away in a dark hole... ... and throw away the key. THE PUBLIC SCREAMS Aah. Ah, die, you cunt. - Letting go. Aargh. JUSTINE LOOKS FOR BREATH POLICE OFFICER: Come along. CARMEN: No, no, no! Walk. - Ah. Yes, Van Zanten. I, um... Are you ashamed that your colleagues did not intervene in time? No, no shame. It was a minor incident and Van Walraven is back in custody. I would like to continue to make the country safer. Can I go through? Thank you. Fiep. Fiep. Fiep. DROPLET A TELEPHONE IS RINGING Van Walraven has appointed the crown witness in the court in The Hague... THE TELEPHONE BEING ON Evert. Grandma is still not answering. LUTHER: Carmen has been pressured. This public display, this smear, has a reason. TV: Justine de Heer... Someone wanted Justine dead. ... she attacked her with a pen. But more importantly: That Carmen did it. MAN: We are closed. - Then you have to close the front door. What are you doing? The girls are further on. Not that your lame boss can do anything with it. Berry wants to speak to Natalie. Only. - No fucking way. It's about your mother. He's on the water, unarmed. Maybe he knows more about Mommy. I'll walk along. - That's not necessary. I'm not afraid. Hey, little one. It's a long time ago. If you wanna throw me in there, you're doing me a favor. Why not do it yourself? - Because I'm a big shit. There isn't a day when I don't think about you or Storm. Which I want to turn it back on. For you and the kids. What do you have left to live for? Not much. Why am I here? I've come to warn you. I have come to help you. Why did you attack Justine? - I won't say anything without my lawyer. I can't do anything for you if you don't talk. BUZZER Jim, I... PAUL: Don't say anything. - I had to... What? PAUL: Don't say anything. Carmen, don't say anything. I came as soon as possible. Carmen. Give me something. I want to say something to my lawyer in private. Good. Fine. I can't help you anymore. I don't want to help you anymore. I'm done here. BUZZER I have another message for you. HE KEYS SOMETHING We overestimated you, I believe. But do not worry. We'll deal with Justine ourselves. Well, I am a man of my word. And your blunder will be severely punished. WHISPERING: Oh no. One last word for your daughter? Mom. Do not worry about me. I was never meant to outlive all my children. Fortunately, it's not that mandarin in my head. It is better this way. Honey, I could hold you one more time. That was worth everything. Take the kids far away from here. These men never stop. Do it now, Carmen, now. CHOKING: Carmen. FIEP IS QUIET ALMOST WITHOUT SOUND: Aaaah. HER BREATHES GABRIEL SIGH So, that has been settled. Your children should help you on your next assignment... ... and get their hands dirty again. For their sake, let's hope they are more successful than you. Listen carefully. They have to free you in two days so we can meet. The rules remain the same. No surprises or your family will suffer. Your oldest son, Lucien, is next on the list... ... when they fail. I'm sorry about your mother. I'm ready. Wait. I want you to record a message. Grab your phone. Freeing your brain, thinking about nothing except your goal. It's the only thing that works if it's not cans. We don't have time for this. We have to find those guys. And then? If Berry's story is correct, there are nine of them and they have an arsenal. Then we need more people. - They are gone. EELCO: Boris. You have visitors. PANTING: They're back. And they just... ... murdered grandmother. Gore bastards. If we don't do what they say... ... they come after everyone. Now they want you to free me. But I don't want that. You must leave. Luther, get them out of here and then get me out of here.

Were you asked something? Listen, please, not my kids. I do everything. We go. The plane is ready. Come on, come on. - Walk. Storm. Wait. Wait. Ahh. Vamos. No tenemos todo el día. I love you. Prepárate, vamos. No. Venga. EMBRACING MUSIC IT IS DEATH QUIET CARMEN SIGH No, not glass. - Sorry sir. Toma un poco de agua. WHISPERING: Jack. He still loves you. You don't want to sit next to him for nine hours, do you? WHISPER: Who is that? From Sun. EXCITING MUSIC Vamos a bajar del coche. Vámonos, vámonos. Dale. This may seem like an exaggeration... ... but last year he killed two prisoners with bare hands... ... because they called you an ugly bitch. It's true. I did it for you, Carmen. You are beautiful. It's so beautiful that short hair. It makes your eyes stand out better. It looks so good on you. Hello, Angelica. Here you have them. - Thanks. My sister looks at us from heaven. I think she would be very proud. Welcome to my childhood home. My name is Angelica. We have something in common. My mother also committed suicide. She shot herself where you are now. A few minutes after my father came home from Amsterdam. After she saw his body. She couldn't go on without him. PISTOL SHOT Are you ready for your last assignment? Come with me. Carmen, I'll do anything for you. I love you. I live for you. After my mother died, my sister collapsed. Holy Virgin, why? She wanted to know what happened the night my father died. The lawyer said you were behind it. But an appointment had been made and we had to hold off on you. My sister just couldn't let it go. Two years ago, God gave her a sign to stop. You were killed, shot and you drowned. Finally she let go of her obsession. She got better. But then she saw the news. Luciana? The Black Widow appears to be still alive. The Black Widow had cheated on all of us and was still alive. You outsmarted the devil. This was too much for my sister. You cheated on me, bitch. You cheated on me. Where is my sister? Where's Luciana? She hanged herself under these arches. Luciana. I loved my father, mother and sister very much. And you are responsible for their deaths. Or not? I found this with my sister's stuff. It's the audio recording of the night my father died. Justine wanted to delete this. She hid everything out of self-interest. That's why she had to die. We had a mole with the police who stole it. Sorry for your loss. The lawyer gave it to us. I wanted everyone here to find out which one of you killed my father. Come on. Come on. Let's go for a ride. THE BULLS LOOSE Come with me. - Walk. Come on. Venga, muévete rápido. Venga, muévete. Muévete. Mueve el culo, venga. Bring them in. THE BULLS LOOSE Aargh. SOMEONE WHISTLE NATALIE CRYES Insert the CD. My grandfather was a bullfighter. A matador. He took my father to La Plaza de Mexico for every bullfight. I think that's where his bloodlust started. Let him in. THE BULL SNORDS EVIL THE BULL ROARS This bull is also very bloodthirsty. One of you will die on his horns today. The rest can go home. - You are lying. You are lying. - I do not lie. How do we know if you are telling the truth? I don't like to kill innocent people, only the guilty. What about my mother? I said I don't like to kill the innocent, but I am willing to. My uncle says it is useful to torture an innocent. Or to kill. To get others to talk. Venga. Mira. No. Please. Please stop. LUCIEN: Mom! Enough. HAPPY LAUGH LUCIEN: I'm fine, Mom. Mom, I'm fine. It was me. I killed your father. I do not believe you. This is too easy. We're going to listen to the recording. You're like a queen. - And you a king. If you are armed, give your weapon to your men. If anything happens, I'll kill your daughter myself. Finally we see each other again. Wine? - Gladly. Red? - Fine. Who are you? - Jack van Zon. First question for Jack. Why were you there? I wanted to be a gangster like Carmen. My suggestion is a weekly cocaine transport, or twice a week. Maybe daily. Do you think he'll ever do business with you? Is that right? Don't you want to do business with me? Never. Otherwise you will never see me again. Can you see it? What did you see under the table? Because after that you took off. Eavesdropping equipment. So you ran out of fear? I left because Carmen asked me to. Well fuck off. You don't belong here. And did he? Yes. Press play. CRACKS A DOOR OPEN WITH A BEEP WHISPER: I love you. I love you. Doesn't that mean "I love you"? JACK CALLS: Carmen. JACK: Carmen, I love you. Why do I feel like someone is lying? Release the bull on her. THE BULL LOYS FURIOUSLY No. Please don't. - Don't hurt her. No, I killed your father. No. No. NATALIE: Boris. CARMEN: Please. Boris. It was me. THE BULL ROARS Aah! NATALIE: Whaah! THE BULL PUNCHES AGAINST SHOT NATALIE: No! I did it. I killed him. CARMEN: Boris. Sure? No, please. Stop. Not my son. Stop. Stop. Release the bull on the boy. It was me. It was me. I do not believe you. - No, it really was me. I slaughtered your father. When I got back Boris was there too. I do not know why... ... but I shot your father. I pointed the gun at him. Your father was a mean bastard. No, it was me. Don't believe that stupid boy. Get revenge on me. Let the family go. It was me. I slaughtered your fucking father. - Did you kill my father? Yes, I killed him. Does everyone agree? GENTLY: No. Boris, I want this. Say yes. Did he do it? JACK SHOUTS Boris, say yes. I killed your father. Is that true? Did he kill my father? JACK: Carmen. This is the only way you have a chance. Did he kill my father? I want this. Say yes. I love you. THE BULL LOYS THE BULL BLOWS ANGRY THE BULL LOYS EVIL Aaaah! JACK Cries OUT IN PAIN HE CAN HE EXHIBITS HIS LAST BREATH Let them go. THE GATES SLIDE OPEN WHISPER: Hey, baby. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. THE DOOR BEeps LOADING BULLS Do I really believe Jack? A madman. I do not think so. Boris, what did you just say? The truth? Do you want to know what really happened? Indeed, my son killed him. But I made it that way. I made him a murderer. He didn't get the chance... ... to become something different with me as a mother. It is my fault. I grew up my children in this world. My world. Your father's world. My kids are like you. They never had a chance. If you want to kill the one responsible for all the death around you... ... and want to avenge your father, mother and sister... ... then I'm the real killer. Without pulling the trigger. BORIS 'BREATH IS COLLECTED Boris, I heard you can shoot well. And don't be a hero. If you kill me, your family will die too. Kill her and you can all go home. Please don't ask him this. He will be marked for his life. If what you say is true, then you have already done so. Kill her. Kill her and you can go. I can not do it. MOUSE QUIET: I can't. Sst. WHISPERING: Yes. This is the best now. After this you are free. Really free. I love you. And I love you, honey. Eternal. remember what Luther said? No emotion. Just the goal. Just the goal. BORIS SOBS And the goal is your freedom. Your safety. That's the one thing I've always wanted. I love you. NATALIE SOBS That's all you need to remember about this day. That I... That I love you.

I could only continue because of you. I wanted to return to the Netherlands every day, but I was not allowed to be selfish. If you were okay, then I was too. That had to be enough.
