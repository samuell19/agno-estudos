Jackpot. Bust it up, dog. No, no, no. Not right now, yo. I think it's the cops. Come on, stop being scared and bust the window out, man. I'm not being scared, man. This is what we came here for! Bust them out! - I'm just saying it's going be to... Shh. Somebody's coming. We'll handle this later. Hey, Elizabeth, it's me. Ahh! That's going to leave a mark in the morning. You go, check his wallet, check his wallet. Where's the money at, big boy? Here we go. Here we go. Yo, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. What else you got for me? What else you got for, huh? There's a couple hundred, boy. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm seeing flash. I'm seeing some flash. Shit! - You know what I can get for this, huh? Thanks, big dog. Do you know what happened? I'm not sure. Oh, my head. Can't imagine that feels too good. Mister... - White. - Jackson White. Mister White, you seem like a decent guy. Can you tell me why you're face down in an alley? Just... This isn't how I thought my life would turn out. But do you ever feel like you're not the man you want to be? You know, I wanted to do something that mattered. I want more. Can we focus on tonight? October 27th. It's my birthday. My 30th birthday. You were drinking? Yeah, there was a party. My client... What, what do you do? I'm a music manager. Hmm. He sang a song about my fiance. How can we contact her? Why do you keep doing this? What do you mean? My ex fiance. Liz! I screwed it up. Did you have any arguments? Anything out of the ordinary happen? Not really. Why did you sit down with Gammons? L.A.'s a small town, James. Dude, I don't want to talk about this tonight. I left early. What happened at the party? Is there something you're not telling me? Just talk to me about it. I feel like he's got a lot of big clients. He can do something. His company has a lot of big clients. He's a promotion away from answering phones and making fucking coffee. My biggest client James, I think he's going to sign with another manager. Just remember I was your client before I was your friend. Jackie boy, it's your gray haired daddy. I wanted to call you earlier but, well, happy birthday. I miss you, buddy. It's Elizabeth. Leave a message. Hey, Elizabeth. It's me, Jackson. I haven't spoken to you in a while. Um, call me if, if you a, if... That's the last thing I remember. - Go home. - We'll be in touch. Jackson White's office. It's me. Dennis wants to see you first thing. Where are you? I'm going to work out of the house today. Jesus. You've got three meetings and a lunch. Reschedule them. What do I tell Dennis? Uh, car trouble. Look, we need to find something for James immediately. I mean, right now. Find out who's looking for opening acts and put it in an email asap. People we know or everybody. Everybody, Stefanie. Everybody. He's moving more units in the Pacific Northwest. He's getting more airplay. I mean, this guy is the next John Mayer. It's the same act. Another girl with a guitar! Crisis control. It's what I do, man. It's what I do. It's what separates the men from the boys. I pushed them into Thursday. Friday you have a 9:30 staff meeting. Lunch with the head of the T Recs, you need to stop by the War Presidents' video shoot. When do I sleep? Oh shit, I'd got to get this. It's a Carolina number. Uh, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Good work today. Say hi to your dad for me. Yeah, will do. What do you want? Who? Oh, Foster! Hey, man, I haven't spoken to you in a while. Wait. Wait. Wait. Cancer. Sir? Sir, excuse me. I don't want to wake you up, but we're here. Oh, come on. This is great. Hello? You forgot a bag. Anyone back there? Sir, I'm sorry. We don't have you listed in our passenger manifest for Flight 319. One second. How is that possible? How do you think I got here? Do you think I walked? No. Astral projection maybe? Your name is White. Yes. Jackson White. My assistant made the reservation last evening. And it's W-H-I-T? I'll call you back. My ticket. My driver's license. My baggage ticket. Okay. That's odd, sir. We, we just don't have you in our system. You know what? I don't like how you guys operate. Have a good day, sir. They've lost my luggage. They've got Barney Fife behind the desk. Find it. You wouldn't believe the rental car they gave me. Yeah, I'll call the airline first thing and I'll get back to you. First thing? Call them now. Okay. I'll call them right now. I'm sorry. Listen, listen, you don't need to tell me we're behind. I know. Yeah, well I need copies of concert gate receipts, their published songs and other paperwork pertinent to the group's income. I also need you to find out who produced their merchandise and if the cost for... No, no, who produced their merchandise. And if the cost of production was subtracted before profits were divvied up. Yeah, get back to me asap. Yeah, no, no cell phones. I got it. I know. Uh, it's Chris White's room. You know where that is? 319. Thanks. Hi. Welcome home. I'm not sure you're supposed to be doing this. Well, I'm not supposed to do a lot of things. I missed you, buddy. Missed you too. You didn't have to come. How long are they going to keep you here? I go home tomorrow. Sure about that? Mm. What do you want? I was going to crack the window. I got it. Oh, that's right, you don't smoke. You shouldn't either. One thing has nothing to do with the other. Dad, come on. We're in a hospital. Everyone else give me shit. I don't need it from my kid, too. Apparently you do. Everybody else doesn't want you to die. They say you've stopped eating. I'm not hungry, kiddo. And you're just gonna light up whenever you... You hear about Dunbar? Tony Dunbar? Mm-hmm. Miami moved up to draft him. Riley thinks he's the hardest worker he's ever seen. Really. Mm-hmm. He got 32 in San Diego game. Baron Davis guarding him. What does he know? What? He's a good coach. He needs a haircut. He doesn't have any more hair to get cut. Jackson White. Hey. I'm really glad you called. Of course. It's no problem. This is real. Sorry, it's just that I haven't spoken to anybody since I got here. It's okay. I'm glad you came. Yeah. So, you're his doctor? One of them. Surgical resident. How bad is it? You should be careful up there. I thought you weren't going to come. Who are you? Let me give you a hand. Nah, it's all right. Bit of a mess. I haven't had people over for a while. Don't be ridiculous. Have a snack. Someday soon this will all be yours. Is the picture always like that? What do you mean? Are you running the cables through RCA's or an S Video cord? Huh? How old is this TV? Oh, Dad. No wonder it looks like a snowstorm. You're using a coaxial cable. Looks fine to me. That's Â¢cause you don't know any better. You know what you need? What's that? High def. Yeah, baby. This remote is for the television. You only need to turn the power on, then forget it. This one is for the cable. It controls the DVD and surround sound. This is the main remote you'll have to know. Okay. Okay. What are you... Dad, Dad, no. You didn't have to do this, you know. It's the absolute least I could do. All right, what does this one do? You know, back in my day, you just hit a button... You have no idea. You hit a button and it comes on. Now why is this not working? It's not working. Batteries. That was your job. No... I told you, aisle four. It was the only thing you had to do. Just walk up to the set, hit a button. That's it. Isn't it time for my medication? You going to ask every fifteen minutes? Only during the commercials. Nice. This guy. This wasn't the first time. The hospital, I mean. Foster told me. Why didn't you say anything? It would have sounded serious. I didn't want you to worry. You didn't want me to worry. Cancer is kind of a big deal. I'm fine. I just uh... You what? I don't want to fight. Fuck you! I want to fight. Jackson! No, no, no. Last night we're in the hospital and I let it slide. But you lied to me. I could never lie to you. Every time we talked it was a lie! Every time you didn't tell me! I thought we were closer than this. We are! Ashville Democrat. Are you looking for marketing opportunities? What are you doing? Homework. Can you do it somewhere else please? Why? Because this is my dad's office. This is his desk. That's his chair. And that's his pencil you're chewing on. The office is empty. Besides, the guy who used to work here got... I'm sorry. You're turning my dad's office into a study hall? Sorry, that's my son. We're all just so broken up about your dad. Maybe he'd come for a visit sometime. Maybe. I'll ask him. Well, I've got the Cobra and life insurance forms if you'd like to look them over. Okay. Mister Sheldrake... Yeah, I know sir. I haven't had a chance to get to him. Uh, no, no, I had to reschedule that. Sir, I'm doing the best I can. Well, I hope I have a job to come back to. Are you really going to threaten me while I'm packing up my dad's office? Fuck! Clearly this isn't a good time. Sorry. Don't be sorry. I'm Kat. Jackson. From New York? L.A. but close enough. Is there something I can help you with? Oh, I... I interned here this spring and I heard about your... I heard and, I want you to give this to him. Thanks. I'll make sure he gets it. You want to get lunch? Uh, no. Thank you. You already eat? No. Well, you got to eat. That's true. But not with me? No, not with a complete stranger. And not when my world is falling apart. Your dad said you were a snob. Excuse me? Not in a bad way. Just the prodigal son who leaves his hometown and doesn't look back. Hey! Need a hand with that? Familiar with the term stalker? Yeah, men tend to get attached to me. Well, why aren't you bothering one of them? He talks about you. A lot. We'll be quick. I think I put that... Okay. It's amazing. I like your song. You look and I, and maybe I'll, I'll steer. - Very funny. - Please. You got it? Yeah? Yeah? I got it. Thanks. Whoa! Enough with the emailing. I'm just gonna... It's Thursday. The music industry doesn't shut down because you want sushi. Well, that's a crime. Now put it away. Just one more and I'll put the Blackberry away. Okay? What? What are you doing? What? Wait! Kat! This is a street! I'm, I'm sorry. What are you doing? Where's the owner? I don't know. There's no tags. Then who do we call? He hurt his paw. We're taking him to the vet. All right. Asheville. Where good taste goes to die. I do not think that would fly with the Chamber of Commerce. You've always thought you were better than anyone else. I don't think I'm better than anybody. Well, maybe just a little bit better. I can't believe they can just lose a bag. What if I had something irreplaceable in there? What would be irreplaceable? I don't know. Uh... I'm sorry. I don't have a 32-33. I didn't even ask for black. What about the French cuffs? Let me check in the back. Should have gotten them the first time. Did the airline lose your manners with the luggage? I'm almost done. I can't believe that nobody in this town sells True Religion. You sure I can't get you anything? A new watch? A haircut? Anything? Consider it an early Christmas gift. Or a late one from last year for that matter. Well, I'm Jewish, Dad. I can't keep up with the dates. It's December 25th. Every year. Isn't that confusing? With Yom Kippur and Passover jumping all over the calendar? Does this look all right from the back? You look a little fat, but yeah. I don't really wear suits. Well, you should. You look good. Huh? So what do you think? The navy or the gray? Yeah. I like this one. Shouldn't we get something a little more practical? We both know I'm only going to wear this suit once. Yeah. It's going to be the white suit. You said I could get anything if I agreed to this. Anything at all. Then I want this shirt as well. Oh, Dad, that's revolting. Does he got any idea on this contract? This cracks me up. My snotnose little kid is buying me a suit. What's that? What? What? You upset? No, no. It's okay, it's okay. Dad, I love you. Yeah. I love you so much. I promise, I swear to you it's going to be okay. No. There's nothing they can do. I'm dying. There's nothing they can do about it. I'm so scared. Come here. Come here. So let me get this right. Your life's ambition is to not become your parents? Totally. They think that human life is defined by its consumer potential. Right. And what do you think? I don't know. But I want what I do to mean something. I'm not sure that one life can mean anything. One life can change the world. Wait until you're in the real world. You'll see. What does that even mean? This isn't real? The real world is where you're no longer driving Daddy's BMW and you have ramen six days in a row because entry level job roughly translates to "We can pay you as little as we like." Your priorities shift. Not mine. Don't patronize me. I got this friend, right? He thinks his novel is going to change the world. He's now 28 years old and he still works at our childhood camp. What's your point? My point is, he spends so much time dreaming that he's pissed his life away. And we used to be so close. Now I don't even know what to say to him. To a guy who still lives for a fantasy that's never going to happen. Dad? Dad? Is it seven already? Yeah. Oh. Here, dad. Thanks, darling. Give me five minutes. Wow! This is just amazing. It's amazing. You still like it medium rare, right? I don't know what to say. I really appreciate this. But? I don't have an appetite. I'm sorry, Jack, if I'd known you'd gone to all this trouble... It's okay. No, I mean it. This is great. They said they would like to see you at the office. I don't want them to see me like this. Dad, you're sick. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Mm. And one of the interns wrote you a letter. Who? Her name is Kat. Katherine Morrison. I like her. Enjoy being home? Sure. You want another one? Yeah. I got it. What's on schedule for tomorrow? I was going to run by the camp. Ben's working there full time now. That's about it. He wrote a book. Ben? Yeah. Is it any good? It's very good. It's very good. It's about me. How much of it? All of it. I didn't even realize until about a hundred pages into it. It's about a politician who loses his soul. He sells out his friends, constituency and religion for power. Haven't spoken to him since? I was supposed to head down to the music festival in August. But that didn't happen. It's good you're seeing him again. You can't leave things unsaid. What do I say? As a rule, the Jewish faith does not address the afterlife. We are asked to focus on the present. There's a reason the Mourner's Kaddish doesn't mention death. It's a celebration of the time we spent... Is she sleeping? Is she sleeping or is she just... Is she thinking? She's very pensive. Or is that sleep? Sleeping Beauty! Jordan! Wake up. Thank you. How could you, how could you sleep through this? Okay, forget it. Girls, can we see your art projects? I uh... I am a loser. Thank you. Well done. Let's see... He must be stoned. Rachel? Earth to Rachel? Are you? Who's the guy in the back? Jackson White everybody. Yeah, uh... I'll come find you. You're, you're Ben's friend. Yeah. Are you going to bust us? I don't work here. No, I'm not going to bust you. You guys want to shoot a round? You want some of that? Oh! How do you know Ben? We went to camp together. What's your name? I'm Jackson White. Wait. Holy shit. You're a legend. No way. You're the Rocket? Well I suppose I was. I'm him. Dude, I heard you dropped 40 points on Camp Barney one year. 43. Hello. He's open. Uh-oh. He's open. He's open. You still got it. Still got it. So what brings you to Hendersonville? Just visiting my dad. Everything all right? Yeah. How's Elizabeth? Or as we say behind her back, the Japinator? Uh, you know, she's as difficult as ever. Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm great. It's good to hear. Because you look like shit. Nine months out of the year I got this whole place to myself. It's great. I read. I write. Sleep till noon. I'm up at six. On a good day. Ouch. Sorry. I'm hooking up with girls, I'm way too old for. Does it ever get old? Not yet. Uh, no. I, I... Adulthood you know, it's it's overrated. It's all uh, tuition and erectile dysfunction. Adulthood's uh... It's working out for you, though? Well, you know I was thinking of becoming a camp counselor. You still thinking about grad school? I'm thinking about it. Doing anything about it? I'm thinking about it. It's great. All right? I read your book and I think it's great. I don't know how I became Sammy Glick. Look, Jackson, man. I never meant to hurt you. Sometimes the truth just hurts. Hey, Ben, we need you at services. Shit. Uh, hey, sorry, I got to... Yes. Yes, yes. On my way, over and out. Yes. Well, I, I should hit the road too. Yeah. I... The real world beckons. So, uh, we still friends? Always, brother. Always. Good. Be well. You too. 315, 317, 323. Where the hell 319? Can I help you? I don't know. Is this 319 Cypress? Yeah. Is that you, Jackson? Uh... Sorry I didn't tell you about my roommate. I just thought it sounded so collegiate. Well, you're in college. Hey, oh, look at your little paw. What's your name? Ophelia. Ophelia? Ophelia. I'm telling you, I have band. Do not leave my sight. Jackson. Alright. That's inside. Oh. Oh. Dance with me. Sorry about your mom. Dude, what the fuck? Come on, Jackson, Matt. Matty P. Six. I was the sixth man for Reynolds in '95. Matthew Price. Holy shit. What, what, what's going on? Living out by the Biltmore, I'm selling ins... What about you, man? I'm a manager for musicians. Fuck, dude. It's so fucking good to see you. Yeah. Yo, Trent! We got... We got the fuckin' Rocket over here, dude! Give him a fuckin' beer! Let's do it! You know what? This is great. My friend's in a band. Wow, you're married? Separated actually. Um... Separated really. You're not married. Not with who you're with tonight. Walking in here with Kat. You were always a pimp. She's legendary. She really goes down. And you're going to have a good night. What did you say? Okay, you know what? I see where this is going and I'm about six inches taller, so you're gonna want to take it outside or I'm going to do something. Do it. Do it. Good choice. Good choice. Take it outside. Go outside, go outside. Hey uh, we, we should go. Okay. Is everything all right? Yeah. Um... Let's just, I want to show you something. Who wants a fucking beer? Who wants a fucking beer! All right. I almost feel like you should, you should close your eyes as we're walking up. Yeah, Â¢cause this looks really exciting. It's a pretty scary part of town. Are we close yet? At least there's no lines. This here. Oh, shit! This is the place? No way. You've got to be kidding me. What are you? Kat. Good evening Asheville! So why did you leave school? I flunked out. You know, by the time I realized how poorly I was doing, it was too late. I went from walking on to the best basketball team in America, to living at home in sixteen months. And the first few weeks weren't so bad. You know I got a lot of calls, a lot of emails, but people moved on. Everyone but me. I sat in my room for weeks on end. I didn't know how to get out of that house. And this town was my personal prison. Hey, everyone's home town feels that way. And we came here for my 21st birthday. Ben, Foster, everyone. Nobody knew I was going to kill myself. But at that point, I don't think anybody would have been surprised. It's funny how therapeutic suicide can be when you decide to end it. Every worry, every responsibility just fades away. So we started drinking at dinner. And when we got here we were, you know, we were hammered. And by the time Whiskeytown came on, I was counting my final hours. And the most amazing thing happened. Ryan Adams. He climbed on to the stage like a drunken troubadour. He was young, sad and fucked up. Just like me. His songs were brutally honest confessions of his failure and pain. And he sang about all the things I thought I wanted to kill. It was the first time in my life I thought that everything might be okay. And I wanted to be part of the art form that celebrated imperfection. I recognized that it was our most human quality. I left him here. All alone. I was all he had and I just left him here to die. You know what? You lived your life. No. That's what you had to do. Your dad knows that. You have to decide on radiation soon. It'll be unpleasant but you got to fight this thing. That it, Doc? That's it. All I know is we're coming here for all your doctor's appointment. Shut up and drink your beer. Remember, it's basketball season. Let's talk about something important. Who do you guys like this season? I like the Bobcats. I think they're going to surprise them. Adam Morrison may need a haircut but the guy can play. It says here the Knicks might resign Allan Houston. You kidding me? The guy's legs haven't been right for years. I'm just reading the article. I mean look, the guy can shoot. He's no Adam Morrison though. Sure he can shoot. He set the SEC scoring record. Come on, he's human though. I mean, the body falls apart after a while. You told me that. At least he knew when to walk away. I'll be back in a minute. Hey, do you need any help? No. Are you sure? No. I can still wipe my own ass, thank you very much. And I don't intend on sticking around till I can't. I'm cancerman. He's not a superman. He's doing well. Yeah, he is. He's not eating well. Well, oxycodone, it's not really good for the appetite. Look, I can't prescribe it, but marijuana does help. How are you? I'm alright. It's unhealthy to keep it all bottled in. You know if I didn't have Allison... You know what I love about our friendship, Foster? What's that? We don't need to talk. Some people want to analyze and nitpick life down to nothing, but not you. You've always understood my not wanting to talk. You let everything be okay. Are you sure you don't want any more, Jackson? Oh, no, I'm fine. Four servings is really sufficient. Mind if I turn on the television? Oh, no. Go right ahead. This reminds me, ESPN Classic's playing the Georgetown game from '82. The championship? Yep. You can watch anything you like, Mr. White. Ah. Some people might think it's crazy to watch a 25 year old game. No one's ever accused me of being normal. Ain't that the truth. Yeah, we split Mom's painting room into offices. Just finished in March. It looks good. I never would have recognized the place. Thanks. Your dad loved this ball. I swear he must have told us about Hank Aaron every time I came here. Look, Jackson. You got to deal with this. I told you I'm fine. No, you're not fine. How would you know, Foster? Because it torn me apart when my parents were in that crash! You selfish son of a bitch. I'm sorry. I didn't want to bring that up. No, go ahead. You're the one that wants to talk. Tell me what an asshole I am for not coming to the funeral. What? That's not what you want to say? No, it isn't. Yes, it is. Say it. Tell me how much I suck at life. I couldn't leave my job, Foster. I'm sorry I couldn't finish school. I'm sorry I didn't become a damned doctor. Fuck you! What? You don't think I see it in your eyes? You're judging me. You always have. Hey. You have no idea how much I care about you. How much I value our friendship! Hey, we haven't been close since college. You think that's my fault, Jackson? Look, Jackson, I've tried. I've tried for seven years to be your friend. And I'll try for the next seven. But now that means getting in your face. Because you can't push this off any longer. You can't keep running from everything that makes you feel pain. You might find out the pain isn't so bad. It means that something matters, Jackson. Elizabeth left me. I figured. It's just that I'm falling behind at work and my dad's dying. And I'm going to be all alone in the world. What about Kat? She's nice. I'm not used to that. And she lives in Asheville and I don't. I think she's good for you in any regard. I think it's worth making an exception for. What is? Love. Have you ever been in love? I love my dad. I know you love your dad. That's not the question. I don't know, I mean I've told girls that I loved them before, but it's never been... Well, it's always been safe and easy. Just regular sex with someone I care about. Everything but that feeling. What are you laughing at? No. Nothing. It's just... If we hadn't spent the last hour fucking, I'd swear you weren't a man. I'm not a man? No, not so much. Men just want sex. Wow. That's all I want. Yeah, I know. You're... I'm what? I don't know. I don't know. Guys my age they just close their eyes and go straight ahead like I'm not even there. Well that sounds incredibly romantic. But your eyes are open. I can't take my eyes off you. I like that. Yeah, me too. What is it? What? It's the, I'm sorry, it's the music. I kind of... You don't like James Cooper? It spoiled the moment. No, I hate this song. It's amazing. I listen to it every night before bed. Do you know what it's about? Okay, well, I know it sounds sad, but it's about this guy who's in a relationship with this girl who keeps on hurting him. And then by the end of the song, he lets you know that he's going to find someone who deserves his love. And he says, close your eyes, come to me, tomorrow's where you're meant to be. Her tears are wet, complexion streaked the love that you have yet to meet. You okay? Yeah. I feel like I'm behind enemy lines. Your mom was uncomfortable here too. Is that why you broke up? It's never one thing. We were meant for certain people. She wasn't my soul mate. But she gave me you. I feel like he's looking at me. Like he knows I'm Jewish. God doesn't have an ego. He doesn't care what religion you are. Tell that to the Christian right. Why do you have to judge an entire faith on its most irrational faction? Let's go, okay? I'm fine, okay. Let's just get out of here. Whoa, whoa, what happened? Nothing. Okay? Just... Did he do something to you? No. It was my fault, okay. There is nothing you could have done that could... Hey! I hit him, okay? With a golf club. Many, many times. So let's just get out of here. Sorry about the room. Taking you back to my dying father seemed even less you know... Cheers. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, you know, I have to tell you something. And I'm not sure how you're going to take it. I'm really worried that you're going to hate me. No matter what it is... Just don't speak for a minute. When you showed up, my life was really complicated. Kevin has been my fuck buddy for some time now. Even when I've had other boyfriends, I I don't know, with you, I just don't want to. And he doesn't understand? No. He understands, I just... I freaked out. God, you're going to hate me. I'm not going to hate you. Not yet. Wait until you see who I really am. I'm a whore. You're not a whore. This is what I'm trying to tell you. Men use me for sex all the time, and I let them use me. You are not a whore. Every time I say "Never again" and... It doesn't matter. But it does matter. Not to me. It does matter! What good is my love if I've given it to so many men? Oh, this is a bad idea. I shouldn't have told you, I just... I don't know. I thought if I got it out of me that... I don't, I don't know what I thought. We should go. We should go. We need to go, okay! Come on. Please, I just want to go. Come here. I know you've been hurt. Over and over and over again. And you still managed to see the best in people. Have you got any idea how amazing that is? You made me find something. Let's go get it. They'll look for a nurse this week. You're sure you have to leave? I got to find a new job before I lose all my clients. That bad. I was holding it together with Scotch tape and baling wire before this. I'm so proud of you. I was terrified when you got back from Durham. I didn't sleep for months. You never said a word. You don't tell those things to your kid. You pulled yourself back up and carved yourself a life. I wish I understood you. Don't waste time trying. You're going to wake up one morning and be me. Life happens. No matter what. You uh... You'll get credit for what you don't deserve, blame for things that weren't your fault. You just have to stick around for the rest. Eh... Eh. Let's shoot some pool. How'd it go with Ben? Okay, I guess. Tell him you love him? It didn't come up. He probably knows, but you'll regret it anyway. You should say it. You certainly say it a lot. I love you a lot. I know. You do? It's the only thing I've ever been sure of. Nice. One more game? What can I say? The man likes to lose. Rack Â¢em up! Oh, I can't get comfortable anymore. Open the glove compartment. This? Medical marijuana. What's your disease? What kind of father do you think I am? I like this song. That's enough. Leaving for the night? Yeah. I told Kat I would stop by. You're seeing a lot of her. Yeah. Okay. Jack. Yeah? Thanks for coming down here. It means a lot to me. I love you. I love you too, Dad. You know, I was thinking we could turn this couch into a bed. Sheets, blankets, the whole nine yards. That won't be necessary. I could bring your bed down here. It was just a thought. The professor is completely biased against anything made in this country. And I'm like, "Come on, you teach American film." It's so frustrating. You know, why does something has to be in another language or just incredibly obscure to be artistic? Are you listening? You know, sometimes the most simple, direct things are the most beautiful. Kat... I love you. What? I'm sorry. I had to get that out there or I was going to burst. You don't have to say anything. Okay, say something. You're the most amazing girl. But? I've got to go back to L.A. And this isn't right for me. I wish I had met you five years ago. I wish I could be that guy. I can't. Too much has happened. You understand? Too much has... I know this is a bad time but it's really essential that you call me for Peter back. They're not going to cover our September or August expenses. You need to call me back. We're talking business affairs. It's signed. Have a drink. Celebrate. Not tonight. Is everything all right, Jeff? It'll be fine. He and Jackson were close. Did you regret it? I don't believe in regret. I believe in mistakes. Regret makes it sound like you can actually do something about it. This isn't even my robe. Come on, Kat! Open up, Kat! For better or for worse, my actions have made me who I am. Writing that book was a terrible idea. But if I hadn't done it, I'd be a different person and I'd be in a different place. I'd be with a different girl. I'd be with no girl. Dad! Yes. I'd like to report a... My dad is dead. Why don't you watch where you're going? You got something to say, boy? What'd you say? Ugh! I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready to see you back. Stay. Stay in Asheville. I can't. I love you. And you love me. You can't say it and that's okay. But I know you do. My life is here. This is your life. No. Me. Ben. Foster. Alison. We love you. You're so fixated on this idea of what you think your life should look like that you can't even see what's really going on. Right now! Here! This is your life. And itÂ¢s going to hurt for a little while. But you just have to do it anyway. I'm not going to leave you. Jackson. What is this? Tragic news from Los Angeles. Asheville native, Jackson murdered in late Saturday evening. Son of longtime Democrat columnist... Huh? Thanks, big dog. Hey! Give me... Get down! Get back down! You want to play somebody with a gun? What's his name, man? Dude, dude, dude, dude. What's his name, man? Jackson White, man. Jackson White. Let's go man. Let's go, D. Jackson. Look at me! Yo, come on, D. 30 years... Suspect is still at large. It's okay. Go. I love you too. I know. Jesus. Looks like a... How many days? Keep him behind the yellow line. What's the official time of death? 3:19am. No! Now do you know what happened? I'm dead. For a few weeks now. We should go. Are you God? I'm afraid not. An angel. Just think of me as a friend. I've always been looking out for you. I'm not the only one. Just listen to the people who surrounds you. I'm not sure that one life can mean anything. One life can change the world. You might find out that pain isn't so bad. That means that something matters, Jackson. Can't leave things unsaid. Are we still friends? Always brother. Always. You might be meeting someone who lets you know. But he's going to find someone who deserves his love. I'll never get to say good-bye. You already have. Did you ever lose someone whose absence shook your very core? Then one day you felt a flood of warmth and the pain was gone, leaving only those memories of love. Everyone makes this journey and your love never leaves this earth. Foster and Alison will help. They become a family, united by their love for you. And Kat? It's harder for her. She'll never meet her soul mate. Most people can deal with a lesser lot in life. You see them everywhere. Living life out of habit. She's not that resilient. She'll wake up one morning with an inexplicable sadness she can no longer carry. Kat! No! Don't worry. She will find you. Same way you found her. In this world or the next. It doesn't matter. We all find our love. Jackson. You have to finish this journey on your own. But you're going to be okay. It was such a pleasure to know you. This is where we say good-bye. Wait! What happens now? You live. Live. Welcome home.
