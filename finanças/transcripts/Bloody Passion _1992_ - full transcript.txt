TOEI COMPANY, LTD. Presents Tateo. Don't worry about Bunji. He'll show up out of the blue. The yakuza are eagerly looking for him. Isn't he being pursued for misconduct? Things are sticky among the bosses. How long do you think I've been a sister to a yakuza member? He must have done something terrible that'd cost him more than a finger or two. Why are you going on a trip during times like this, Tateo? Is my brother in Kyushu? Are you going to look for him there? Are you done? I have to catch a bullet train. Don't worry. He's a nice guy, so he's probably stuck with a ditsy gal. Saori. No, no, no, no and no! Saori. Don't go. Don't leave me alone. Listen. Take care of yourself. Let go of this town and our memories. What am I supposed to do all alone? Go now, you idiot! His peers confessed. They're the gangs in Kansai area. Bunji led the robbery of funds. I knew that he would pull a double cross. He even revolted against his Kansai peers and hogged the money. He has a sister named Saori. His insane behavior is unheard of. My dad adored Bunji. My intervention won't calm my dad's anger. He was betrayed by his trusted follower. Didn't Bunji contact you? No. You liar! You're the last line he's got. I'll do what I can to find him. Make sure to find out where the money is cached. You're not going to war. I'll look after Saori although I don't know if I can assume your role. Saori has no other choice but to live on her own. Hello, Brother? Is it you? Who is it? Say something. I know it's you. It's you, Brother. Bunji. Are you there, Bunji? Where are you? Bunji. Bunji, Bunji! Were you stabbed? The spelling of the real man is the same as that of the devil. That's so true. I now understand. Hang in there. Come on. I'm in deep trouble, Tateo. I can't escape. The members are the watch dogs. You can't fool the yakuza when they're really after you. We have to go as far as we can. I have nowhere to go. Been there, done that. Don't give up. I asked you to come so you can kill me. What the heck are you talking about? If they find me, they'll torture and lynch me. Please just finish me. Go ahead. I know you have a gun with you. Bunji, where is the money? I miss the good old days. It was a strange group of gangs, we had many buddies. Uncle Furuta, Jay, Risako, and Maki... We used to run wild. Where did you hide the money? I never imagined that I'd end my life at the age of 25. Where is the money? I'm suffering. Just do it. Please shoot me. I'm in pain. I can't handle it. Say hello to Saori. She wanted to go to summer school. Please shoot me, Tateo. Please, Tateo. Let's do it. Brother! Brother, Brother! Brother, Brother, Brother, Brother, Brother! Brother, Brother, let's go home. Bloody Passion Cast JINNAI Takanori ASO Yumi NAKAMURA Toru YANAGIBA Toshiro NAITO Takeshi YO Kimiko MUROTA Hideo FURUOYA Masato Directed by KUDO Eiichi Yokosuka Station You've come a long way. I ran out of good stuff. Sorry, this is all I got. This is how you do it. It tastes so good. Did you go to the hospital? You were always concerned about it. Where are you going? What are you going to do with Saori? Hey, Tateo, you're back. I'm back. I kept your room as is. Your warm bed is waiting from you. Go ahead. Do you want to drink tonight? Makiko. Welcome home. I waited for six years. I don't know if I can perform well. Excuse me! It felt good. It was great. It was wild and you're the best. You haven't changed at all. You'll be looking after Saori, right? So, we're over. You're too good to be over with. Forget about a horny lady. Bye! Shall we go? Let's go. Her past is too cruel to handle. I think about her future and only hope to erase her past. If she ever recalls everything about it, she'll never forgive me. I fully understand your situation, and I'll tell you about something that only you can do. Okay. In order to erase her past, we need to replace her memories with beautiful ones even if it's made up. Do you understand, Matsuura? We need to replace her memories with beautiful ones even if it's made up. This was a busy town six years ago. It's no place for yakuza now. Weren't you under the care of Kirishima? He dogged out of Yokosuka and he's climbed up the ladder in Yokohama. That smart one is out of m league. Hey, you. What are you doing? Hey! Can you let this month slide? I'll pay you next month. You said the same thing last month. You bastard! Get over here. Use your common sense and return what you owe. Otherwise, I'll go to the Defense Agency to make a violent protest. Trade me iron horse in for some cash. Are you okay? I'm fine. How diligent! I love it! By the way, how's Saori? I told her a lie. That's what her doctor told me to do. Who knows how this will last? It's no use. You're probably right. Kensaku, I've been having something on my mind since I was in jail. What is it? I wondered why Saori came to the harbor at that time. I don't know. I can't tell her what Bunji asked me to. What did he ask you? It's about summer school. Their hometown. Welcome back, Tateo! Congrats! Job well done. Sit down. This place is the same. I made sure of it! It's the Independence! It was my ship. You were a weird yakuza back then, too. You never got drunk nor caused any trouble. Instead, you'd spend time working diligently on crafting the imaginary town right here. Welcome back. I'm home. What's up with you? It's been six years. Aren't you excited? Maki is amazing. She's got all the big shots hooked. A street girl has now become a businesswoman. Risako, learn from her. Be quiet, you military bully! Let's have some drinks! Sounds great! Kensaku, be our server. Who are you to talk? You have a bad reputation. People say that your love letters suck! That's right. Shut up! Thanks to my love letters, love was passed on across the borders! Ah, huh. Yours is the only one that didn't make it. For Tateo, I'll strip my shirt. Knowing you, you'll strip for anything. Your job is done. It seemed long. Sorry for the trouble. How's this month? Not bad. For this dead town, it's not bad, huh? Come on in and wait. If I had known about your release, I'd have had my guys in black suits lined up in front of the jail for you. You're being such a stranger. I'm no longer in the loop. Reconsider. My dad has an executive position open for you. That's too much. After all, I couldn't locate the 300 million yen. He said that you fulfilled your duty by shooting your own friend. He's too lenient. You didn't do that o show faith. You shot Bunji for his sake. That's enough. It's a reward for your service. Take it. Hang onto it. I'll let you know when the value goes up. It might be time to leave the league for a man who can't let go of the past. A golf club is a perfect example. A tattooed man isn't allowed to bathe there. We can't walk around the golf clubs with our heads held high. I heard the complaints from the top yakuza about it and I'm in the process of constructing a golf club for yakuza. Atlanta is the target. Do you hear me? That's where the following Olympics will be after the upcoming one. We'd better get onto it before others do. I'll manage a bar that serves good beer. I'm afraid that I can't accept it. Excuse me. Did you see Saori? I heard that gangs in Roppongi got her hooked on drugs. Does she have any memories? No. Will you be taking care of her? Yes. I wish she could forget about everything. Damn it! Kensaku, can you gather people? You're motivated to create memories for her. Creation of memories? Something like that. Are you serious? Even if it's in vain and for a short time, I want her to live in a dream. I agree. She dreamt of studying abroad in Italy to become a chef. I want her to remember about her dream only while I create. beautiful memories of her past. If we don't play well, she might end up recalling the truth. It'll be a gamble. I'll make a bet, too. Trust me. I've already secured the location and folks. I think I know who they are. We only have three days till Saori's discharge. We'll be busy from! tomorrow. This one. Wonderful! I don't look like a principal. I wonder if Saori had a boyfriend. She was a young 18 year-old. She must've had a boyfriend or two. A boyfriend? Yep. Drove to Shonan beach and sailed with yacht. He was an elite Keio student. I know! It's me No one else can play this important role. Right, Makiko? Listen up. You're her ex. You dumped her. I would never do that. You did. You're the punk who started dating a rich girl right away. What? If didn't have any intimate relationship with her. Only a kiss? Not even that. What about a regular kiss, not French? Well, then, it's fine. What about touching her? Say it again and you're dead. Don't be so serious. I'm just kidding. As soon as you broke up, you got married. Nowadays, young ones marry late. But you did get married young! So don't even think about trying to reconcile with her. Are you asking me to behave in a way that she won't like? If you ever try to come on to her, I'll make sure that you can never open those puffy eyes. You're so mean. Well, whatever. Saori is so naive so when we broke up, it was very hard. I said, "Saori, you have a dream of becoming a chef. Don't think about a normal life like having a family with me." She broke into tears and I held her tight. No! She's returning to this town tomorrow. Without knowing that it's a fake town. Saori, your suitcase. Take care. Go ahead. Doctor, thank you for everything. I got all the kitchen equipment ready. Your brother used to say that he wanted you to learn cooking in Italy as you wished. Me? I know of a chef who'll visit his home in Italy in a month and he'll take you with him. Don't worry. He's also your brother's good friend. Studying to be a chef? Take your time to get better until then. I would like you to tell me things. I want to know about myself. For example, what was I like? What kind of a high school student was I? I'll tell you tomorrow. Okay. You can't quit now. They're on their way. The real principal will return in the afternoon. I can't do this. I don't look like a principal. You'd better not quit now. Kensaku, say something. Saori will suspect me and be sad to discover the truth. I don't want to see her sad. You've gone through hell in your life, but no longer have the guts. Shut up. I really can't do this. They're here. What am I going to do? Oh no. I can't. I quit. You'll be fine. Believe in yourself. You took like nothing but a gorgeous principal. Sorry. I don't want compensation, so let me go home. What compensation? What do you mean? I quit. Listen up. If you don't act a man, you'll be just a lonely guy for the rest of your life. What do you mean? You snatch 50,000 yen from girls you sweet talk. Is that how you want to live your life? Let's do this. Good luck! Come in. Excuse us. Principal, it's been a while. Oh, well. Principal! It's you, Tateo. I was waiting for you. You look great. Oh, ahh. You're Saori. I'm glad that you are okay now. I was looking forward to your visit. You were his last student. Is that right? Yes, that's right. He teaches English. Principal, she just got discharged from the hospital, so we'll get going. Oh, okay. What kind of a student was I? I remember one thing clearly. You were terrible in English. How funny! I must've enjoyed my youth here. I remember that you were a cheerful girl who enjoyed playing tennis. I see. You haven't change at all. It seems as though six years have never existed. Can I take a walk alone? I'll wait for you at Corleone. She could tell. She knew we were faking. I feel bad for her. What do I do now? Everyone. This is a famous Italian restaurant appearing on magazines. You girls are from rich Families in Yamanote and are young professionals with 50 million yen annual income. Jay Jay! Welcome. Quiet! Make sure to follow instructions. We can't fail. Rich kid, okay? Businessman, ready? Be quiet fag. Don't let your wig move. Calm down. I know. Welcome! I'll take your coat. Thank you. Sorry to be late. You must be hungry. Please come in. Hey! I'm glad that you're better. When are you coming to help out? I'm the only chef and we're busy. They're always packed and he's really having a hard time. Let's go to Sicily. I'll take you around. This is the owner. I'm Makiko. I've been waiting for you. Kamiya! I'll be right back. They attract high-end customers. Saori, do you want to wear it again? Is this me? Yep. You're Saori, a 24 year-old who has a dream of becoming a chef. You look great! She smiled. She did! What a relief! I heard that Saori was smiling. I wish I was there to see it. Did she smile? How? I had never seen a girl with such a beautiful smile. She's probably still wearing that apron and standing in front of the mirror. She continued smiling at her reflection in the mirror. Really? Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thanks to you, I feel encouraged to go through till the end. Everyone, thank you. Come on, let's have some drinks! Cheers! Good morning. Good morning, Saori. What's wrong? I can't wear it. What are you talking about? Why was everyone so good to someone like me? What do you mean by someone like you? My past seems too perfect to believe that this is me. Was I really that girl who always had a smile and a dream? Listen, Saori. Your brother was the first one who brought you here. He told us to look after you. He said that you were only good at cooking, so he wanted you to excel at it. He asked us to help you out. Tateo said that he'd help out and Furuta agreed. Since then, you have become like our family. Do you understand? Our precious sister returned home after six years. I think that seeking happiness create problems in the end. Don't worry about it and cheer up. She's fragile like a glass doll. She was presented with her past but is too scared to accept it. I feel like I'll probably be the one to break the glass. Hang in there. You're almost there until she overcomes her doubt. I guess so. You're right. What are you doing there? Calm down. Hi, Saori. We've been waiting for you. Hello, thanks for yesterday. Please follow me. This is Kensaku. Thanks for coming when you're busy. Sit down please. It's been a while but you haven't changed. Do you remember me? We had a great time going surfing and sailing in Shonan beach back in your high school days. Why did we break up? Well, that's because... Did I love you? Well, you and were... What made you end up not liking me? It's not that I ended up disliking like you. We met at Corleone and dated for a year. We were almost engaged. Almost engaged, but my parents forced me into an arranged marriage. You got upset and we broke up, so it wasn't because of you. After our break-up and my brother's death, do you know what I have become? Do you know about my tattoo? Was our relationship intimate? Please tell me. Sorry, only once. I see. You got married? No, I didn't. I'm single. I dogged out in the middle of the wedding. The reason is. The reason is because I couldn't forget about you. I still love you. Let's get going. You must be busy at work with Mitsubishi Corporation. I'm with Mitsui & Co., Ltd. Please go ahead. I'd like to talk with her. You're an idiot! What the heck do you think you're doing? I'm sorry. I got carried away and became such an ad-libber. Ad-libber? How are you going to mop up your behavior? I have to follow my words. You had planned it from the start and deceived me. You're an army bully and how dare you talk about your relationship and Mitsui & Co., Ltd? How dare you lie to her like that with such a straight face? I want to become someone else. I'm not the only one. Do you have any idea how we feel about creating her past? It's not only for her. We're doing this for ourselves, too. We all want to see ourselves who've changed to help her even if it's for a brief moment of fantasy. Can you make her happy? You're the one who killed her brother. What can you do, kid? Tell me! Say something. Tell me! You're responsible for who she is now. Why? Why didn't you run away with Bunji and I? We all agreed that we would! What are you doing? Saori... What's the matter? She left. Hey, what are you doing? The gangs in Roppongi got me addicted to drugs. It was only once. Forget that. I'm going to the police station to ask about my past. Will you come with me? Never mind. I'll go alone. Wait. Let me go. What will you do after you find out about your past? What's that mark? A mark? I have a tattoo. Who did it? My doctor said that it was just from the time I was hanging out in town. Is that all? When I first saw it at the hospital, I felt like it's the color of the blood that is circulating inside my body. The more I hear about my beautiful past, the stronger I feel about having a dark past. My tattoos tell me so. What can I do to remove it? Who will get rid of it for me? I will remove it. Will you? Will you, really? Do you promise? Kensaku. You are a weirdo as always. Watch your tongue. I'm sorry. I'm deeply into the play. How are things? Does Saori remember anything? Unfortunately, we're in the midst of re-creating her memory. It won't be at your mercy. How many times do I have to tell you? What you're doing will only help her recall her memory, not the other way around. By creating the past that didn't even exit, she'll recall her real past. Brains have repulsion effects. It's like shock therapy. She'll soon recall where that money is kept. It's an asinine idea. She's trying to become a new person. Doc, please give shock therapy to an idiot like him. I have a seal of approval from the doctor. I thought that you're both money hungry, but you share the same hobby, too. You must be sharing your butts, too. I finally got it. You're the one who took Saori to the scene where Tateo shot Bunji six years ago. You're evil. She was into Tateo. That was the very reason. You badly wanted to make her yours. But it didn't work out. She refused to be your girl even if she was nearly dead. Where the money? Where did he hide it? Saori, where is it? Where is it hidden? Where is the money? Saori. Saori. What do you want? Saori. Are you into this bitch? My dad instructed me to bury her alive in concrete and throw her into the sea. She lost her memory from being a drug head and forgot all about the money. It's your loss. I wanted to protect her. I had no choice but to put her into the hospital. We operate by gaining trust from our patients. We can't ask her about the 300 million yen from the start. This is reverse therapy. By forcing her to be someone else, her memory is likely to come back. 300 million yen is nothing to you... Until the end of the bubble era! Please leave Saori alone. True love. Please. Even if it was my command, you wouldn't have liked the idea of creating new memories for her. You planned to snatch Saori. Runaway lovers. Get out of here and go back to the play. All he cares about is money, that bastard! Saori doesn't remember about the stupid money. What was it for? What was this past six years? Damn it! Damn it. Sneaky bastards! A lonely man's song. How sweet of you! Where are you going? A hotel or a house? Take care! Be happy! Happiness! It hurts. I'll take you home. Hey. What happened to you? Kensaku! Hang in there. Who did this to you? Ambulance... Call the ambulance! Listen. It was all in Kirishima's plan. He brought Saori to the scene six year ago. Tell me later. Let's go to the hospital. Don't worry about me. I have to tell you now. Sorry. I never told you this, but I didn't even want to be a part of creating memories. Don't talk. When you chose to go with the plan, I convinced myself that Saori would be able to live a new life. I thought that I could live with her somewhere. You can laugh at me, but I was serious. Saori, come here. Sorry, Saori. I loved you. I loved you. Kensaku. Kensaku. Led by an angel and the rhythm of the trumpet, he will come down from the heaven. At that moment, the dead will rise. to the heaven, then we, the survivors, will follow. We will be lifted by the clouds to meet with the dead. This is how we connect with each other. Under the words of God. Amen. Forget it. Forget about everything. Kirishima is waiting for you. He'll kill you. Let go of everything. Go out of my way. Saori. What are you doing? Stop it. Stop it, Saori. Tateo, Saori is... How did you feel... when you shot my brother? Did you feel like you've fulfilled your obligation? Now, you're after the money? That's why you planned such a sick play. No. To tell you the truth, my memory was back ever since you showed up at the hospital to pick me up. A high school gal who enjoyed tennis, studied abroad in Italy and had a college boyfriend. I kind of had fun trying to go along with your corny play. That's not it. You were still the same girl as before. I've been thinking of how to put it all in words to get back at you... You who lost your head with money. You're lying. You're still the girl I remember from the time when Bunji was alive. Do you want to hear me out? You! Right here! With your hands! Killed me love! Right? There are Bunji's last words from that moment on this very spot. He asked me to tell you this. "I wanted to go to summer school." Bunji wanted to go to summer school. I'll tell you where the money is. I want to see how you'll change once the money is placed in front of you. Hey, it's me. Saito? Not at the bar? Okay. Hey, what's wrong? Are you all alone? It's cold out here. President, a call for you. It's me. Is Saori on that island? Is Tateo with her? Okay. I got it. Make an arrangement. This is where we considered home. It resembled our hometown. My brother used to say, "I'll buy you this island someday. We'll make it into our own island." Only in our dreams. That's news to me. He never told you because he thought that you'd make fun of him. Summer camp at an American school. That was the summer school, huh? You're desperate for this money? You're a killer. Don't even act like you're an angel. All I trust is this. We'll go home and talk some more. Wait right here. Saori. You dumped me as directed. I know that you killed my brother for his sake. He wanted it, too. Why don't you defend yourself? An atonement? Continuing to serve your jail time? It's certainly like a jail. I was behind bars for six years, and feel like I'm still in jail. You're free to go anywhere. I just couldn't recall anything about after leaving Yokosuka. I kept crying. I felt that I didn't need my past, then I felt better. Five years had passed and that summer, I thought about committing suicide. The following winter after six years, you returned to my life. I'll send you back to Yokosuka across the sea. Turn me to Kirishima. He won't kill me. He ruined your past six years. He'll ruin your future, too. I won't let that happen. I won't let him have you. Don't hurt the girl. Okay? The back-up will come soon. Saori. Saori. You were too drugged out to remember, but you were such a slut. Remember about the heavenly life? Huh, Saori? Quit it! What an idiot! Stay away. Boss! Let's go home. Let's go, Saori. You created my past. Create my future, too. I can't die in front of the girl I fell for. Saori, let's go. There you go. Saori. Here we are! The End
