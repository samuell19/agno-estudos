Welcome home, rocky. Compliments of the house. Why? I see all the big shots when they get off and on the trains. If they got their picture on the front page, paper's on me. Here. Take a look. Nice picture, huh? Add 5 years to it, it would look just like me. Gee, it must feel great- out of the jug and a big shot again. You lead some life, huh, rocky? Yeah. I'm a real dinger. Man: rocky. How you been? You might say all right, gus, but I wouldn't. Treated you rough, did they? Oh, I got a couple of bruises... up there. Well, you're out now. Yeah, and what's 5 years? You could do that just sitting around and waiting. Yeah. Aren't you gonna say hello to your buddy delong? It's been a long time, rocky. I guess I changed. Glad to see you. I owe you plenty. Right now I'll settle for a drink. I've forgotten the right words. I wouldn't even know how to order. Let me do it. I'll buy. Homecoming present? That, plus the fact I'd like to talk to you. The man wants to buy. Never argue with a policeman. A detective. Thanks. What do you say, rocky? Well, I had different plans for my first one, but, uh, my friend here looks thirsty. I'm always thirsty. No hard feelings, rocky. Don't bet any large amounts on that, gus. Could have been worse. A month ago, you were up for life, then your friend here turns up with your alibi. I gave you that same alibi 5 years ago. You'll have to admit it was a little thin. You said you were out drinking with some marines when the holdup took place, only the marines never show up. We landed, only 5 years late. Sorry to keep you waitin', pal. No, that's ok. I just would have wasted my time having fun, anyway. We all got shipped out after that night. I guess you don't remember the other boys. I couldn't remember any of your names. Then they all got it one way or another. I misplaced a leg somewhere, so I never heard about the mess you were in until I got back, about a month ago. How did danny morgan feel about your getting out? Well, how should he feel? It's no comfort station they run up there. Too bad he couldn't dig up a marine to alibi him. Look, gus, if this is just a social get-together, why not skip it? I want to talk to you about the money from the holdup. You should read my pardon that says I didn't have anything to do with the holdup. $100,000, and not a penny of it has ever shown up. Maybe it got inflated right out of existence. I figure you might know where that money is. Figure anything you want. I'm a citizen again. I'm gonna keep a tail on you, rocky, 24 hours a day. It shouldn't be too tough a job. I'm not going anywhere. When you do, we'll be right with you. Where do you figure I might go that would interest you, gus? You'll make a play for that money. It'll be easier than going to work. If I get you again, rocky, the army, navy, and marines won't be able to help you. You buy nice drinks, mister, but you talk so much. Good-bye, mr. Delong. I'll be seein' you, rocky. I count the hours. Hey, mac, 2 more over here. Let's move. Well, pal, you're now a free man again. Any questions? Just one. Shoot. Who are you? I figured you might be curious about that. You weren't one of the guys I was out with that night. I could have been. I was a marine. I was here in town that night. But you weren't one of 'em. No. It's all very simple, pal. I- I heard about your case, checked up on it in the newspaper files... found out I fitted your alibi perfectly. Here you are. Why'd you do it? Occasionally, I always drink too much. You went to a lot of trouble. Wasn't too tough. I wore all my decorations. I've got plenty. Eventually you'll get around to telling me why. Not eventually. Right now. You were up for life. There was the 100,000 bucks kickin' around, so I figured you might be... grateful if I got you out. You not only picked the wrong horse, you didn't even get the right track. Life could be beautiful with money. Maybe you didn't hear me. I didn't pull that stickup. You'll be an awful big disappointment to me if you didn't. So I'm a big disappointment. You didn't do it? No. But I know who did. Oh. Now I feel better. You know, I think I'm just like that policeman. I think I'll stick around for a while and see what you're up to. Then come on. I want to introduce you to a pretty girl. Nice car. I understand these things cost money now. I traded my left leg for it. Who's this girl we're gonna meet? Wife of a friend of mine. Sounds like a dirty trick, but I'm for it. She's danny's wife- the guy I went to jail with. She really pretty? She's out of bounds. I said she was danny's wife. Glad I never met the guy. Danny's one of my favorite people. Ok, rocky. I never was one to argue with a criminal type. Ooh, and she has to be the wife of a friend. Run amok, junior. That's the wrong girl. Hello, fellas. And a happy mother's day to you, too. I'm darlene la vonne. I'll bet you are at that, dear. Tell me, where can I find the manager? Williams? Oh, he's probably over there in the office. Thanks. You fellas gonna live here? Maybe, if you're a good girl and go to church on sundays. Aren't you the fresh one. Mm-hmm. ♪ Sailed across the sea ♪ ♪ she ran away from me ♪ ♪ to meet another man ♪ ♪ it was a dirty trick ♪ ♪ she got me all- ♪ hey, godfrey, where can I find the manager? You're talkin' to him. I want to rent a trailer for 2. When and for how long? Now, and I don't know. $10.00 a week. It'll break our backs, but I think we can swing it. All right. Follow me. Hey, rocky. I hope you were kiddin' about us staying here. Only a couple of days. Darlene will keep you company. I'd rather take her out of all this than move in with her. Manager: this is it. Delong: oh, swell. House beautiful. What are we, the poor relations? What about some of those places back there? This is all I got left. It's a wonder it didn't fall down before we got here. Well, the place looks lived in. Yeah, but by what? Take it or leave it. 10 bucks a week. You're a smooth salesman, mr. Williams. You talked us into it. Be careful how you spend that. It was a present from the taxpayers. Say, ain't you rocky mulloy? Well, I guess you could say that. Look, mr. Mulloy, I don't want any trouble in this camp. Then don't start any. You see, I got a nice little setup with lots of transits- we like it. It's quaint. There's no hot water. Suppose you wanted to shave? We'll ring for you. I think I'll go take care of darlene. Another man might walk by. Just the week, mr. Mulloy, huh? I don't know. You got a nancy morgan living here? Yeah. She lives in trailer 8. She in now? She works across town some place. What time does she usually get home? In about an hour. No kidding, mr. Mulloy, I don't- I got a bag in the car. Go get it, will ya? Let's get out of this hot sun into a nice, cool bar. In a few minutes, honey. So it's honey already. I call everybody honey. Darlene, what do you do? Well, I'm sort of a part-time model. Oh. I don't get it, rocky. Why do you want to fool around with that nancy morgan when I've got a lot of friends more cute and more fun? I may call on you for help later. Mmm. I'd like to see me with 100,000 hidden away some place and just gettin' out of 5 years in the clink. Wow. You know, alongside one of my friends, that nancy morgan's a deep freeze unit. What about that saloon we were gonna look up? In a few minutes, honey. Of course, you being her husband's friend helps a lot. I guess it'd be all right if you took her out, wouldn't you say? I'd say you talk too much. Hey, you gonna sit there and let him talk to me like that? Nope. Let's go to some nice, quiet place where we can't hear him. He's got some nerve. Look, you run along and wait for me in the car, huh? I'd still be willing to forgive and forget and call up a girl for him. Run along, darlene, before I fracture your spine. Some funny guy, aren't you? Gonna go after that money pretty soon, eh, rocky? Pretty soon. Yeah. Don't wait up for me. I don't like it at all, mr. Mulloy. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. I wish I knew what you were talkin' about. There's been a man in my office asking questions about you. Irish guy, looks like a saint, acts like a thug? That's right. I think he's a cop. I know he is. I been thinkin' about things. That mrs. Morgan- she's the wife of the guy who pulled the stickup with you, isn't she? No, she isn't, because we didn't pull any stickup. Well, what I meant- what's bothering you? I don't like the cops hangin' around. Well, forget about the cops. They're not interested in any two-bit setup you got here. Well, I don't want any trouble. Look, is my rent paid? Yeah. Well, then stop bothering me. I still don't want any trouble. Neither do I, from you or anybody else. Rocky. Hello, nancy. Better grab me quick before my knees give way. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to surprise you this way. Oh, that's all right. I knew you'd be here. Let me look at you. No change. Same height, same weight. Oh, you look fine. When did you get in? A few hours ago. I moved mr. Mulloy in, mrs. Morgan. I'm in inner sanctum number 12. I thought we all ought to get together and have a little talk- good-bye, mr. Williams. Hungry? Wasn't I always? You were lucky to get a place here. Mr. williams likes couples. Oh, he got one. Delong's with me. Oh, the marine. That's right. Invite him to dinner. We'll put more water in the soup. He's out bar hopping with a gal named- believe it if you can- darlene la vonne. When the marines land, darlene's always there waiting for them. Hey, this is nice. What a break, rocky- his showing up after all this time. It's more than a break. It's more like a miracle. How is danny? Just fine. He told me to have a drink with you for him. Is he really all right? Nothing wrong with him that getting out wouldn't fix. Only 6 more months. With luck. Did he mind your getting out very much, since he had to stay? I couldn't do him any good up there. Maybe I can down here. Oh? How? Well, delong proved they were wrong about me. I'm going to prove the same thing about danny. You're going to try to open up the whole thing again? I'm going to turn it inside out. But that just sounds like more trouble. What more can happen to us? We've had 5 years yanked out of our lives. That's a long time when you break it up into hours. Why don't you fix us that drink, rocky? It's in the cupboard. All right. You stop worrying. Remember the day I introduced you to danny? I was so proud of my girl, I wanted to show her off. That was a long time ago. 20 centuries. You both deserve a better break than this hanging over your heads the rest of your lives. Rocky, you never told me how your felt after we had that quarrel, and danny and I got married. You know how I felt. I crawled away and died for a few weeks. Only for a few weeks? It lasted longer than that with me. But you wouldn't change it now. Of course not. But sometimes I wonder. Don't. Not even sometimes. Rocky, why can't we just forget everything that's happened? Forget? I mean about the prison and you and danny and the holdup. Even if you are innocent- even if I'm innocent? I didn't mean it that way. Of course you did. No, I didn't. It wouldn't make any difference to me if you and danny were involved. But we weren't. I know you weren't. Oh, rocky, why do you twist everything I say? Oh, big homecoming, and I'm showing you a bad time. Sorry. Looks like lassie's home. Come along. I'll introduce you. Well, pull up some dust and sit down. You, of course, would be nancy. Of course. You're out of bounds. Am I? According to my underworld friend. Where's darlene? I'm very disappointed in darlene. She turned out to be a part-time model and a full-time pickpocket. We may very well have visitors before long. What happened? We had a great many drinks in this place she knew about, and when she thought I was tight enough, she went for my bankroll. Country boy, city girl. I slapped her wrist. The bartender didn't like that. What about the bartender? I let him have it over the head with a peanut machine. He's resting now, in the emergency hospital. Oh, swell. You better run along. He's right about the visitors. But what about you if the police come? We're old friends. We can always find things to talk about. Oh, rocky- see you tomorrow. All right. Good night. Have you read that book, what to do until the police come? I know all the answers. The bartender gave me a drink that tasted funny, and I don't remember anything after that. Give me the keys to your car. You burglars always work at night, don't you? And about 10 bucks. Sure, sure. We're partners. You want me to go along? No, thanks. Oh, uh, if you run into darlene, tell her all is forgiven. Delong, you go for the bottle an awful lot. You never get to the point where you say things you shouldn't, do you? What milk is to a baby, that is to me. Go commit your crimes with an easy mind. I'll see you later. I sincerely hope so. Where are you going, rocky? I've gotta go see someone. How long have they been here? They just got here. Isn't that a little foolish, carrying a gun just the day after you got out? You better go to bed, nancy. Be careful. I will. Oh, uh, you wouldn't be looking for a fella named delong, would you? Yeah. Do you know him? Friend of mine. Ex-marine. Wants to file a complaint with you boys. He wants to file a complaint? That's right. A bartender in some gin mill down the road got him tight, tried to roll him. Works with a dame named darlene, from here, I think. Well, now, that's not the way we heard it. The bartender said that delong got fresh. Well, of course he'd say that. Why would he tell the truth? Darlene's a good kid. She wouldn't tell a lie. Look, delong is carrying quite a roll. Anybody who'd try to rob a one-legged marine hero is 3 kinds of a crumb, wouldn't you think? Yeah, but how do we know? Well, go talk to him. I think the bartender is getting off easy. You ought to pick up his license for running a clip joint. Where is this delong? Inside. Come on. I'll show you. 35 cents, please, sir. There's a man following me. He'll want to know where I am. I'll save him a lot of trouble. Tell him rocky mulloy's in there. At the los amigos? That's right. Keep the change. I'll tell him, mr. Rocky. Hiya, rocky. Gimme a rye. Haven't seen you around lately. Don't tell me you can't read yet. Just tryin' to be delicate. Buy yourself a drink. With 10 bucks, I could buy the joint. Not many tips like this around here. I want to surprise castro. Thought maybe you'd forget how to use that telephone. Sure, rocky. Sure. I might buy another round on the way down. Fine. Fine. Oh, rocky. Thanks for the dough, but you shouldn't have bothered. Castro's expecting you, anyway. That's all right, russell. I got that 10 bucks from a typhoid carrier. Nice to see you, rocky. Yeah, I imagine you've been looking forward to this. It's always nice to see an old friend. Get up from your desk. Sit over there. We can talk better. I've been reading so many detective stories lately, I guess I'm just naturally suspicious. I don't blame you. I imagine you're kinda sore, huh, rocky? Oh, I was planning on taking you to dinner. That's quite a break, your getting out. Not for you. When I went up, castro, I was making 20,000 a year. 5 years-that's 100 grand. I'm willing to split the difference with you and settle for half. The dollar's only worth 50 cents these days. I'll stand the loss. Why should I, rocky? Because that was the deal you made when you dreamed up the job. I drive the car, I get 50,000. Yeah, but you didn't come in on it. Everybody pretended like I did. The cops, the judge, and a lot of guards up at prison. You told that story to the jury about me propositioning you. Couldn't make it stick then. How can you now? I don't have to make it stick with you. We know different. Besides, I'm not out to prove anything. I'm just here to collect some money. I only got half. Do you want all of my share? That's cheaper than dying. Would you kill me, rocky? Wouldn't you? Tell you what. Why don't I set you up in a new book, hmm? I just want 10,000 a year for 5 of the best years of my life. Can I reach in my pocket? Go ahead. There's $500. That's 1%. Put it on a horse called dragonfly. But place it with another book, huh? Suppose it loses? It won't. Should pay about 8 to 1. That's 4 grand. What about the other 46? You know, things have changed around here in the last 5 years, rocky. I'm 60% legitimate now. I see. I'm what you might call a pretty big man. Good. Then you won't miss the money so much. You know, big men don't scare easy. Then big men must get popped off pretty regularly. Where do I place the bet? Call me in the morning. Big, legitimate man like you still playing with loaded guns. Nice to have me back, huh, castro? Hey, mister... you owe me two bits for the game. Want a shine, gus? You, uh, didn't wan to recognize me in there, huh? I got a bad reputation. I gotta be careful who I'm seen with. You went to a lot of trouble to make sure I'd know where you were. Why? I want to make your work easy for you. I don't want you to make it too easy. You have some business with castro? We're thinking about opening up an ice cream parlor together. Look, I'm tailing you myself, and I want to get some sleep. What are your plans for the rest of the night? Home and mother. Don't cross me up, rocky. You wouldn't believe it, gus, but I want you with me wherever I go. I'll try and be there. Good. Uh, pay for my shine, too, will you? I'm fresh out of hot money. Hold it! I- it's me. It's me. What are you doing up? I thought I heard somethin'. What? Somethin' like a shot. Smell it. Huh? Smell the barrel. If it's been fired, you can smell it. Nothin'. Remember that if you decide to call the cops and tell 'em I've been shootin' up the place. Now, turn in. Such people you run around with. Put that out, will you? Can't sleep, huh? No. I can never sleep after I've been shot at, either. Well, one thing's sure. You certainly stirred up plenty of action. You must be getting close to the money. I just took a walk, saw a few people. Must have liked you. They followed you home. Go to sleep. I had an interesting evening after I got rid of the cops. Good for you. I had a drink with nancy. She's stuck on you. You're stuck on her. She's out of bounds, remember? You got a big problem, boy. Out of bounds, married your best friend. Yeah, you got a problem. Shut up and go to sleep. Is the door locked? You can relax. The bogeyman's gone. Good night. You turn off the shower? I couldn't even turn it on. You drinking that stuff so early? Listen, doll girl, when you drink as much as I do, you gotta start early. Well, you two made up? Darlene's gonna give up pickpocketing and start studying forgery. Aren't you ashamed of yourself, darlene? I was only gonna keep his money for him till he sobered up. That's like tying it up permanently. Can I use your car today? It's just a stock model. No armor on it. How about some coffee, rocky? Fine. I'll be right in. Your girlfriend know anything about the shooting last night? Why should she? Just asking. Gonna have a little party tonight. Keep yourselves available. That's me. Available. There's nothing I like better than a party. Would you like some coffeecake? No, thanks. There was a time when we used to think about having breakfast together every morning. Things go haywire, don't they? They do if you let things happen instead of make them happen. I thought you'd be at work. Not for a half hour yet. Rocky, tell me what you're doing. I don't know myself yet. Just probing a few sore spots. And getting shot at. Oh. Williams gets up early. I don't think they were trying very hard to hit me, just scare me off. From what? Where did you go last night? I called on someone who may be able to clear danny and me if I play it right. Did you talk to danny about what you're going to do? As much as I could. I only had about 5 minutes with him before I left. And what did he say? He's like you. Leave well enough alone. Then why don't you? Well, danny only got 1 to 10. I got life. I guess I'm just that much madder than he is. Where are you going today? There was a witness at the trial named fletcher. I thought maybe I might call on him. I'll go with you. Mm-mmm. Why not? Just in case that guy last night wasn't trying to miss, I'd like to keep you out of it. You know, this concerns me a little bit, too, rocky. You're awfully pretty alive. I'd like to keep it that way. Now drink up. I'll go change clothes and drive you to work. All right. I'll be ready in a few minutes. Next time, make my coffee a little stronger, huh? Oh, yes. I remember. What are you smiling about? It used to annoy you when I moved the mirror. It still does. Funny, I forgot to ask you- what are you doing for a living now? I'm a secretary. When did this happen? When danny went to jail, I had to find a job. I suppose it wasn't too easy to find one after the trial and all. People forget... if you let them. Turn left at the next corner. I'll pay you back for breakfast at dinner tonight. What are you using for money these days? Well, I've got a horse in the third at burlington that's collateral for a bank loan. Sometimes they break a leg. They got a picture of this one running first before the race even starts. Take care of yourself. Fletcher apartment? I don't need any brushes, but come on in. Mrs. fletcher? Yes? I'd like to see your husband. That's not very flattering. Would you like some coffee? Well, a second cup never hurt anybody. Cream and sugar? Black, please. My name is alice. Mind if I call you rocky? Why should you? Because that's your name. What do you want with my husband? Get him to admit he was wrong about identifying you? Well, the guy could make a mistake. He's had 5 years to think it over. I guess you don't know about arthur. What about arthur? Arthur's dead. "Fletcher, arthur, 43. "Service is monday, 2 p.m., "little church of the roses "memorial chapel. Cremation follows." Heart attack 2 years ago. He was 16 years older than me. You seem all cut up about it. He'd have died of shock anyway if he'd known you were getting out. What do you want with arthur? You're in the clear now. I've still got a good friend doing time on his identification. Tell me, did your husband ever say anything about maybe being mistaken? Arthur wasn't much of a talker. Oh, come on. What difference can it make to you now? None, particularly since the money's all gone. Money? Arthur came into a small inheritance just about the time of your trial. How small? $5,000. Must have been nice for you. Mm. He bought me some new clothes. Who left him the money? I never asked him. Would you tell the police about it? And get picked up as an accessory? I can have them check his bank account for that period. The money was left to us in cash. We kept it here and we spent it in cash. I'll deny all this, rocky, so don't bother trying to involve me. Why'd you tell me? You wanted to know. Besides, you look like such a nice man. If I promise not to involve you, will you tell the nice man who gave arthur the money? Drink your coffee. There's an awfully swell guy still sweating out a prison rap. Look, I'm sorry about this swell guy, but I never was involved in this, and I don't intend to start now. Well, thanks anyway. You're not leaving? Just when I thought things were beginning to get interesting. In what way? Well, we don't have to spend the rest of our lives talking about dead husbands and holdups. What else could we talk about? Me... or maybe you don't find that very interesting. Can I use your telephone? Help yourself. Oh, uh, this is rocky mulloy. Get me castro, will you? Hello, castro? You told me to call. Where do I place that bet? Crossley hotel cigar stand? I'll be seeing you. Now, uh, where were we? You were on your way out. I thought we were going to sit around and talk about you? Well, we're not. Get out of here. Oh. So my call to castro didn't set too well, huh? I said beat it. Someday, alice, you and I are gonna have a nice long talk. And you'll really do some talking. Go on. Get out of here. You said that. I'll have a pack of those cigarettes, please. I want to see the man. About a horse. What makes you think this is that kind of- I don't think. Castro sent me. You're a friend of castro's? We've met. Maybe you've heard of me. First name's rocky. I've seen your face. In all the papers. Society section. The pictures don't do you justice, rocky. What horse? Put this on dragonfly in the third at burlington. Right there. $500. That's a lot of money to throw away on a very long shot. In case I win, what happens? I see you again? No. The delicatessen downstairs. Ask for harry. But you can still see me again. Especially if I win? It won't matter. I work here every day, and I live upstairs in room 201. Thanks. I'll see what my nurse says. Announcer: they're off and running. At the start it's rule two, breaking on top. Flying cap is second. Papoose is third. Morningside is fourth. Fast furious, fifth. Dragonfly and red satin. Down the back stretch it's rule two leading by a length and a half. Morningside is second by a half a length. Papoose on the outside is third by 3/4. Flying cap is fourth by one length. Red satin is next by a neck, and dragonfly is closing ground on the rail. 'Round the turn it's rule two leading by a half a length, papoose challenging on the outside is second by 3/4. Morningside is third by one length, flying cap and dragonfly. Dragonfly trying to get through on the rail and can't find racing room. He's going to the outside. They're in the stretch, and it's rule two leading by a head. Papoose is second by a neck. Morningside is third by 3/4. And now dragonfly is going to a drive on the outside. Here comes dragonfly. They're coming down to the wire and it's papoose and dragonfly. It's papoose by a head and dragonfly. And it's going to be close. And now it's dragonfly and papoose. And it's dragonfly, the winner by a nose! Papoose is second by 3/4 of a length. Rule two is third by one length and morningside's finished fourth- 4 grand, huh? Well, I'll credit it to your account. You harry? No. Wait a minute. I'll get him. Hey, harry. 5 to one I know why you're here. Yep. Same horse. Well, that's the way it goes. That horse has really knocked me over today. You wouldn't believe it if I told you this was the biggest loss of my whole career. Really. Great for you guys. So what if a bookie gets hit hard? Big joke. Big joke. Never occurs to you that I got a wife and kids like other people. Well, there goes the 2 weeks at camp I promised the kids this summer. 4 grand. What are you gonna do with all that loot? Get an operation so I can play my violin again. Uh, swell. Big joke. Santa claus, soldier. I was a marine, not a soldier. For a while there, I began to think you'd gone south with my car. Busy day. Santa bring something for me? That he did. Here. Read this. Might improve your mind. "Does drinking affect your social life?" Here's an orchid for darlene... and I got a little something for you here that might keep her interested in you tonight. Where we going? Got a big celebration. There. Looks like about 1,000 bucks. Well, it should. You must have found the guy who did it. I had a horse working for me today. The horse give you the money to put down on himself? You got a right to know what I'm up to if you want to. I don't. Nancy's been after me all day to talk you out of doing whatever you're doing. Oh? Ok, I've talked. Well, thanks. You know, I don't think nancy's as worried about you personally as she pretends to be. What do you mean? I mean I think she's more worried about what you might stir up. You're a pint ahead of schedule. Only the blind can really see. Well, you're only half blind. I'll fix that. You know I had another friend once who had trouble with that stuff. He found a way to get off of it. How? He quit. Thank you, billy sunday. Comb your hair. We'll leave as soon as the girls are ready. Yeah. Good evening, lieutenant. Social or business? Business. I don't know why they ordered all this food. They're still dancing. Maybe they like cold steaks, or maybe they're just working up an appetite. I'd say they were stuck on each other. What difference does it make? Hey, waiter! You better put these steaks back in the oven. Oh, and cancel that strawberry shortcake and bring me a double bourbon. I got a bad tooth. Mighty handsome present, this dress. Mighty handsome girl inside it. This is like old times, nancy. Except I could never get you to dance. Funny. I like it now. I must have mellowed. Remember the last time we danced together? At the beach one summer. Mm-hmm. The summer I asked you to marry me- 3 times. 3 times? No wonder I lost out to the other guy. That horse must have paid good odds. 8 to 1. Did delong tell you I talked to him? Yes, but let's relax and have fun tonight. I'm really worried, rocky. Oh, nancy. You can't have any fun that way. Well, the marathon dancers are back. Gee, that's a pretty dress. Beside you, I look terrible. Good old darlene, honest as the day is long. Hello, rocky. Hiya, gus. We went ahead without you if you don't mind. I want to talk a little. Would you like to step outside? Not particularly. All right. If you're trying to bribe me, that'll do it. You spent $265 on clothes today, rocky. Is that illegal? With these bills it is. Where'd you get 'em? I bet some money on a horse. They're part of the aetna payroll. Got any more? Where's the rest? There's lots more. I told you I made a bet on a horse. If you checked me at the dress shop, you should have placed me at the cigar stand. I'm a busy man. I didn't wait for you to come out of mrs. Fletcher's apartment. What did you go up there for? I could have told you her husband was dead. How is mrs. Fletcher? I think I'll leave. Nancy. You might as well give him yours, too. You kiddin'? Somebody's loaded us up with hot money. It isn't worth a nickel. All right, fingers. Hand it over. Are you kiddin'? The man wants it-now. So you bet on a horse, huh? Where'd you get the money to bet with? Castro loaned me $500. Ok, rocky, who booked the bet for you? The girl at the cigar stand in the crossley hotel. Fine. And who paid you off? Guy named harry. Delicatessen. Same building. All right. Let's go check. We'll start with harry and work back. I'm sorry, nancy. You want to stay here, or would you like to go home? I don't want to stay here. You kids go on home. I'll be there in about an hour. Don't be too sure. I said an hour. Hey, where's harry? Harry? Yeah, the guy you dug out of the back room this afternoon. You must be mistaken, mister. There's no harry here, and there ain't any back room. Don't give me that. Hey, this isn't funny. Where is he? The guy who paid me off. Paid you off? The guy with the wife and kids who talked and talked. Where is he? Take it easy. Come on. Strike one. Crossley hotel? Come on. Look, honey, i- hey, where's the girl who was here earlier today? I don't know what you're talking about. I've been here all day. I was in here. I made a $500 bet on a horse. We don't book any bets. There was a very pretty girl here. Where is she? You sure this is the right place? No, this is a gag. She said she lived in 201. All right. Let's go see. Yes? Oh, I'm sorry. I expected to find the girl from the cigar stand up here. Oh, you did, did you? Well, I came back from out of town unexpectedly today, so there won't be any party tonight. Now beat it! Strike 2. You know, rocky, I think we better get down to my office. All right. Anything for me, frank? Not a thing, lieutenant. Get me louie castro on the phone. Right, sir. Sit down. This may take a little time. Maybe 20 years. What a prize sucker I am. Were you in on the frame, too? All you smart guys are prize suckers, and I don't have to be too bright to trip you up. All I have to do is watch and wait. Sometimes not so long, either. Yeah? Man: I have castro for you, lieutenant. He's in his office. Ok. Thanks. Castro? Lieutenant cobb. Couple of questions. I've got rocky mulloy down here. He says you told him to bet on a horse last night. Rocky mulloy? Is he in town? Cobb: yeah. He says you gave him $500 to bet on a race. Now, would I be donating to rocky mulloy? He's lying. Hasn't been around. Ok. Just checking. Strike 3. Ball one. Castro is high and wise. Says you were never around there. Well, you can't believe that. You saw me come down from his office. I'm surprised at him slipping like that. That phony bookie was just a plant to get that hot money on me. I wouldn't know. You gonna hold me? No. I don't think I will. I've been waiting for 5 years for some of that money to show up. Whether you got it or just scaring it into circulation, I don't know yet. As a matter of fact, I don't care. So go on. Keep pokin' around. We'll see what happens. Old clay pigeon me. Yeah, you're expendable, rocky. Hey, you've got all my dough. How about some cab fare? What are you gonna pay me back with, some more of that hot money? Maybe all of it. All right. There's 20. That's out of my own pocket. Remember, I got a wife and a couple of kids. I haven't met anybody lately who hasn't. Are you awake or do you want some more water? All right, don't talk, but you're gonna listen real hard. You don't know when to stop, do you, stupid? I'm out one day and you try to fix it so I'm right back in again. How big does the 50 grand look now? Can I get up? You can't move one inch. I love to see a big legitimate man like you flat on your back. In case you're curious why cobb didn't hold me, you slipped up, castro. He followed me to your place last night, which makes that little lie of yours about not seeing me kind of curious. He's beginning to wonder about a few things. That money's beginning to tie right back to you. Why don't you calm down? Because I don't feel calm. I talked to a woman today who told me about a mr. Fletcher who was bribed to identify me. You know anything about that? All right. You want the money. Let's make a deal. You got another horse for me? Let me get up. I'll put this right through your skull if you get up before I tell you. I'll get the money for you. I don't want the 50 now. I want all of it. How can I get it all? I've only got half of it. You can use that fertile brain of yours to figure that out. You make one more cute move and see how long you live. I'll have it all by tomorrow morning. You sure will. Now get up. 20 bucks? Gee, I can't crack that. Come on. We'll get it. Mm, he's back. Well, that was a long hour. Got any good money? Yeah, a little. Why? Pay the cabdriver. How much? Buck 95. Here's 2 bucks. Keep the change, and don't lose your head. Wasn't a very successful celebration. Oh, it doesn't matter. You can take those presents back tomorrow. Nancy, I didn't expect to do what I'm doing without getting in a little trouble. Well, what are you trying to do, get back to where danny is? Looks like we're about to have a very tense moment. Look, it's quarter to 2:00. We got plenty of time to make it to a bar for a nightcap. The time doesn't matter. I know a bartender. Keep this for me, will you, pal? You carry the money this time. We'll see if I can steal it from you. Aren't you the comic and insulter? Where are the car keys? If I'm not back by tuesday, drag the river. Good night. Aren't you taking an awful lot on yourself? Danny asked you not to. I ask you. I'm getting close, nancy. But one thing you seem to have forgotten. Danny doesn't get out in 6 months. He merely comes up for parole. Everything you're doing is just gonna make it that much harder for him. Believe me, it isn't. I wouldn't take a chance with that. Don't you think that should be up to him? After all, you're already out. I'm too close. I'm not gonna quit now. Oh, sure, rocky, have it your way. You always have. Rocky's gonna help his friends even if it kills them. You can't really think that. Oh, I'm just sick of the whole thing. I've been living with this hanging over my head for 5 years. I'm trying to fix it so it'll be easier for you from now on. Well, you're not. You're just messing everything up. You've always been stubborn. You make up your mind and nobody can change it, not even me. Call an ambulance. You needn't bother for this one. She's dead. Rocky: go on, I said. Call an ambulance. He still alive? Yeah, who are you? Police. I'm tailing you for cobb. Well, you did a great job. Where's the guy who did this? Guys-2 of 'em. My car was headed in the wrong direction. They were out of sight by the time I got the door open. You better leave him alone till a doctor gets here. Rocky, they thought that was you... of course they did. And me. They just didn't care who they got as long as they got me. Rocky, they thought that was me. Take it easy, dear. Don't go anywhere, mulloy. Cobb will want to see you. I don't want to have to look all around for you. No-good mess. They were after me and got you. Sorry. What's the difference- this or an alcoholic ward? How bad's darlene? As bad as she can get. Oh, that's a shame. I was gettin' awful fond of that little pickpocket. Yeah, I know. Look, rocky, this thing's getting rough. I think you got your neck out too far. Don't worry about it. Let's forget our whole deal and go fishing or something. You like fishing? Used to. At least it's healthy. You sure you don't know who did the shooting? No. By the way, officer, I'd like to talk to lieutenant cobb. Well, I'll tell him. If it's about that phony alibi you gave for mulloy here, cobb knows all about it. He's even discussed it with the d.a. I figured. That's not what I wan to talk to him about. Tell him that unless he wants me to sue the city, he better do something about getting me a new wooden leg. I'll mention it to him. Yeah. See if he can get it in knotty pine. I want it to match my den. Come on, mulloy. Cobb's waiting for you. All right. Rocky. Yeah? I know where we can pick up a couple of fishing poles cheap. Plenty of time. Look, they made a mistake. That doesn't mean they're gonna stop trying. For rubbing. Cobb: just like the old days- blazing guns and big black limousines. Aren't you indignant, and don't you want to call for your attorney? He's on his way. Well, this is murder- not just a cheesy matter of some hot money, but a dead girl and a shot-up soldier. You know they were after you, of course. It doesn't take an i.q. of 150 to figure that. And you, mrs. Morgan, except for a little mistake, you'd be lying on a slab in the morgue right now. Can you think of any reason why? No. I can't imagine. I'm not asking you to imagine anything. You're alive on a rain check. You better start remembering anything that might help me. Where were you last night when someone took a shot at rocky? I was in bed. Sound asleep, huh, and it never even woke you? Lay off her, gus. Oh, sure. I don't want to upset anybody. What's a little thing like murder? And you were in your bar having a drink with a couple of friends. That's easy enough to check. Yeah, you'd be awfully sure of that, yet you were home earlier when rocky slapped you around a little. Castro: that's right. Why did you go back to your bar? I couldn't sleep. I can't hold any of you, but I want you to know my fondest hope is that one of you bumps the other off so I can pick up who's left. Are we through? You are when I say so. Now, just get it through your heads that the pressure's on. I wouldn't give a nickel for your husband's chances before that parole board with all this going on, and I wouldn't give a nickel for your chances with those 2 apes running around looking for you. For you, I just wouldn't give a nickel. You two can go now. Not you. Cobb: oh, rocky. I'm taking the tail off you. You're on your own now. You picked a swell time to do it. That's what I figured. We'll wait for your attorney. I love to watch them operate. Wait for me, driver. I'll be right back. Don't go. I won't be gone long. Rocky, please don't go. I couldn't stand it if anything happened to you. Nothing's going to happen to me. If I told you you meant everything in the world to me- don't talk like that. I can't help it. I don't care anymore. Maybe I shouldn't say it, but I'm going to anyway. No, you're not. You're gonna stay here and get some sleep, and I'll be back in a little while. Rocky, please! I'll be back. Get in. Let's go to your place. Don't be a chump, rocky. This is exactly what cobb wanted you to do. Your place. It's too early. It's not even open. There's nobody there. That's why we're going to your place. Get in. Stop right there. Get up on the desk. Get up there and lie down. Lie down? We seem to talk better when you're flat on your back. You know, there's no use kiddin' you, rocky. I- I've been out to get you. I was kind of a chump to fool around with this at all. Like I told you before, I'm 60% legitimate now. You know, cobb doesn't have anything on us yet. He's trying to get us to fight it out for him. What are you doing? You ever hear of a game called russian roulette? It's supposed to show how much nerve you have. 6 chambers, one bullet. Oh, now-now, wait a minute, rocky. I- Now, take it easy, rocky. And every time I spin this, you've got a 5-to-1 chance. That's better odds than you gave my friends last night. Look, rocky, the money's in a safe underneath this desk. I'm not interested in the money now. Look, rocky, I'll tell you- I'll tell you where the rest of it is. It'll be a cinch for you to pick it up. That was a messy killing, castro. A pretty little girl isn't so pretty anymore. A one-legged marine is all shot up just because somebody thought it was me. You'll have $100,000, rocky. I'll help you get out of the country, huh? You don't get the idea, do you? Will you cut that out a minute! Look... you drag me into this thing and you're gonna ruin a couple of your very best friends. Like who? If you hadn't been so thick-headed, you'd have seen it a long time ago. Danny pulled that stick-up with me. You had turned it down, but he didn't. No, it's the truth, rocky. Danny killed the guard. Fletcher had identified him before I got to him with the 5 grand. He agreed to frame you and name danny as an accessory. Who do you think has the other half of the dough? Who? Nancy, his wife. How do you think I knew you were coming to my office the other night? She called and told me you were on your way over packin' a gun. Go on. She's been trying to keep your nose out of everything. She even took a shot at you to scare you off. So you tried to kill her along with me. Oh, she was shootin' off her mouth about fletcher. You said so yourself. All right, stupid, pick up the phone and call cobb. Oh, you're nuts, rocky. You want to play some more? What am I supposed to tell him? Tell him to get over here. You're gonna make a confession. Take it easy with that thing. Look, rocky- you're stretching your luck. Yeah? Lieutenant cobb, please. This is louie castro. What's the matter, castro? Hello, cobb? This is louie castro. Get over to my place. I'd like to make a full confession. You in trouble? Yeah. Rocky mulloy is with me here now. We'll be right over. Come on. Thanks, lieutenant. Well, that's that. Now will you put that thing away? I don't think we're gonna play with this anymore. Now that you've called your 2 boys, let's really call gus cobb. I think he'd like to meet them. And do me a favor, castro, while I'm on the phone, try to jump me. I'd love nothing better than shooting you right in the belly. They're all around us. Let's shoot it out. Let me get out of here, will you? You shouldn't be too anxious to get out there. The boys might think you called 'em into a trap. Give me a break, rocky. Let me get out the back door. Your first 6 months in jail, castro, are gonna be a little rough. You won't be able to sleep much. You'll be wondering what your friends are doing. I'm not gonna take this alone. I'll spill everything I know about danny and the girl. Of course, it won't be as tough on you as it was on me because you really belong there. This wasn't my idea. I only work for castro. I know all that. Give me the key to this joint. I haven't got a key. I'll tell you anything you want to know. Give me a break, will ya? Take him away. You wait for the coroner. We're goin' in the back way. You hear that, castro? That's the heavy foot of the law. Get yourself a good lawyer. If you're lucky, you might get off with life, like I did. The money's in a safe under the desk. Take care of him. Wait a minute, rocky. I don't suppose you have a permit for this? How much of the money's under the desk? His half. Where's the rest? I don't know. I said I didn't know. Who is it? It's me, rocky. Oh, rocky, I'm so glad you're back. I've nearly been out of my mind. Where have you been? Looking for castro. You found him? I went to his apartment, to his office. He's hiding out somewhere... or looking for me. You've gotta get away from here. Go somewhere where castro can't find you. I've been thinking about it. Take me with you. Take you? Yes, rocky, please. Where would we go? Anyplace. It doesn't matter. We've just gotta get away. Well, that isn't so easy. But you can't go without me. I couldn't stand to be alone again. Danny will be out in 6 months. You can stand 6 months. Rocky. What is it, nancy? I'm not gonna wait 6 months for danny. If he got out tomorrow, I wouldn't wait, and you know why. No. You tell me why. You're just afraid to admit it, but you know. Take me with you. I haven't got the cab fare to get us to the city limits. I've got some money. You couldn't be making much at that job you're doing. I've got enough to take us as far as we want to go- the other end of the world, away from castro, away from everything. That's a long way. Not if you've got $50,000. No, not if you've got $50,000. It's in a suitcase in williams' basement. In the old house? Oh, I couldn't tell you before. I'm surprised you didn't guess. Danny was in on it. I've had the money all the time. 5 years. Oh, I wanted to do something, but I couldn't. The whole trial you didn't say anything. Rocky, I couldn't. Castro told me if I said anything, I'd be arrested for having the money. You had the money, and I went away for 5 years. Oh, I didn't want to see you go to prison, but I was afraid, afraid of castro. Why didn't you tell me when I got out, nancy? I don't know. Oh, but we can forget all that. It's all worked out now. You're free, and we're back together again. That's all that matters. It's always been you and me, rocky. You know that. Yeah. It's always been you and me. Darling, what's the matter? You've always been in love with me. You still are, aren't you? I still am. Then you'll get me out of here. I'll get you out. This morning? Can we leave right away? We'll leave right away. I'll get packed. Sure. You'd better get packed, too. Sure. Darling, we'll have such a wonderful life together. Hurry. Rocky... I just came from the hospital. Delong's gonna be all right. Thanks. Did you find the rest of the money? Yeah. It's in a suitcase in the basement of the old house. I knew it couldn't be in her trailer. I've had it searched a dozen times. You might as well pick her up. She'll be packed. You feel pretty rotten about it, don't you? How would you feel?
