For real? Yeah..it seems like my Dad is working overseas.. And my Mom is busy with my work. I want to go over to my Grandma's house for summer vacation! I mean...my little brother is with me too. Hey...do you remember the mixer? Takaya-kun and Kanon-kun said it right? They asked us if we wanted to have some fun during summer vacation! I...have the perfect fated encounter scenario! For example.... What if he helped me out when I was lost on the road. And then it just so happens that he's a transfer student in my class! Then I'd be like "Huh? Are you from that one time?" That would be the fated encounter of a lifetime! Rio.. That's a little over the top... That won't happen! Hey Rio-chan...Have you never had a boyfriend before? You're just a playboy! You think so? That's right. I knew it! Fated encounters don't happen! Right? Nope, nope! That's why I'm worried about her! So I brought her over to this mixer! That's right! Rio-chan! You see all of us in front of you right now right? That's right! We're all right here! There's a ton of cool guys here! Okay, okay, okay! Can I get hooked up too? Sorry! Rio-chan! You're going home already? I'm Kanon Yuu. Sorry, I can't leave my little brother alone for too long... Do you wanna hang out during summer vacation? I want to talk to you more...and I think you're cute Mio-chan. Cute? Well... Do you want to exchange contact information? Okay! It's already this late!? I'm sorry! Can I not believe in fate? I don't want to meet him in a mixer but rather in a fated encounter. I'll fall in love if he tells me those same words. I'll definitely be happier...forever! Rio! Look! Look! Thanks for the ride! This is the best! I'll go buy some juice! Okay! I caught it! It's my first catch! It's so big.... That's amazing! Do you like bugs by any chance? Are you sight-seeing? Umm...not exactly... Have you looked over there yet? Awesome! There's a ton of fish! I'm glad that I brought you here. It's slippery. Thank you! Here! It's the card for my shop. We have juice and other goodies. I can even give you a souvenir if you'd like. Later! And then... It was the springtime of life that was more blue than hot! It was the start of the blue summer! Ao Natsu. Brought to you by Rjgman56 subs. Grandma! Grandma! You finally came! We're here! Long time no see! Long time no see! Can I touch him? Yeah, that's fine! Welcome! Huh? The girl from before? Thanks Gin-chan! Not at all. He's from the Izumi liqour store. His name is Izumi Ginzo. Ginzo? He's helping me out with my shop too. He's a lifesaver! These are my grandchildren Rio and Souta. Come on...I told you about them! I told you that my grandchildren from Tokyo are coming over! Your grandchildren? Good afternoon. Gin-chan is a senior in high school so he's two grades above you. He lives close by too! You can have a lot of fun together. Right? Obaachan. I'm going to go and get things ready. Thanks! Now then...come on in! You're tired aren't you? How wonderful! It's the start of my fated summer! Hey! Thanks for earlier! For taking me to such a beautiful place... You know what? You just leave your grandma alone don't you? You're the worst. I just have 40 more days huh? It's so hot! It really is hot! Obachan, I'm going to fix the soft cream signboard. Really? It's all beat up. Can I ask you to do that? My store is doing pretty good today after all. Hey! This summer! It's better if me and my little brother help this summer. We're here to help her until we have to go. That's impossible. What are you doing sleeping in until noon? Besides...you barely come here. You're gonna go home soon. This ain't Tokyo! That's why... Don't say anything irresponsible! Excuse me! Can I have some ice cream cones? Okay! Please wait! Grandma! Right away! Two of them please! Two? Got it! Move! You're sight seeing aren't you? That's right! Here! So beautiful! This is the card for my shop. It looks so nice! We have juice and other goodies. I can even give you souvenirs if you'd like. Thanks for the meal! Thanks for the meal! Thank you! Hey! Listen up... Are you trying to compete with me? Are you okay Rio? Stop doing stupid things that will make your grandmother worry! Gin-chan... You're so superficial and fake... If anyone got a beautiful card like that... If anyone? She's late... I...got a little pissed off... She just leaves you here alone for a long time. They just came over here acting like good grandchildren. No way Gin-chan! I don't get left alone! I go and visit them in Tokyo too! Look! I went to the Sky tree this year. And this is Soramachi. And then...where did I just go? Hold on a second... It was Harajuku! Is dinner still not ready? We'll eat when Rio gets back! Okay! Oh no... Oh crap! Oh crap! Oh crap! Nooo!!! Hey! Get a hold of yourself! It's me! Your Grandma showed me some pictures of her in Tokyo. She told me you don't leave her alone. I'm sorry for getting the wrong idea. I was a little envious of you. I thought I hit the nail on the head or something. Turn off the flashlight and look up. So beautiful! I thought you would have that kind of reaction. Let's go! Ginzo! Thanks for coming and getting me. Later! My fate.... I'll create my own fate! I'll make it and show you! They came from Tokyo. They are Naruse's grandchildren. Rio and Souta! Good afternoon! And then... These guys are... Villager number 1 and villager number two! Hello I'm villager number one. Good afternoon. Wait hold up! Who is villager number one? Properly introduce me bro! This guy is Namio and she is Satsuki! Please take care of me! By the way.... Have you already done the initiation challenge? Rio! You don't have to force yourself! If you're scared then back out! You can do it. Believe in yourself! Three! Two! One! That was the best! We underestimated Tokyo! That's right! I definitely couldn't do that! You're amazing Rio-chan. Hey! Marika-san! Good afternoon! Good afternoon! These are Naruse-san's grandchildren! She had grandchildren? I'm Otori Marika! I'm older than everyone but don't worry about it! Please take care of me! Please take care of me! Hey, hey! This girl jumped from that bridge! Isn't that amazing? Are you always here Rio-chan and Souta-kun? You're here until the end of August right? Then do you wanna participate in the Ueno festival? The Ueno Festival? We're going to participate in it by default. It's the only event where tourists and villagers are able to participate in it together! That's why we want people from Tokyo to join! Right? That's right! There's going to be a lot of people here this summer. I'm looking forward to it too! Best regards! Marika! Marika-san is always getting into an accident. She's always calling Ginzo for help. Well...he can't afford to let the future daughter-in-law die. Thanks Ginzo.. What are you doing? Thanks! Here you go. I'm home! I'm home! Welcome home! Wow, they've gotten so big! This is Gin-chan's Dad. Do you remember me? There's no way they're going to remember you! Is that right? Well, it's been quite a while! But man...they really are her kids! She looks like Nao-chan when she was in high school! There you have it! Is that right? Yeah! I was your mother's classmate. If I didn't meet my wife, I would have chased her all the way into Tokyo! Something like that! What are you saying? Thanks for always doing this Gin-chan. Sure! I really thought that my life would be over in the forest! That's why I'm going to do my best this time! That's Marika for you! I'm counting on you! You really are something! You need to step down soon. Wouldn't it be good to have a successor? Look! Look! Look! Come over here! Ginzo! That's not right! That's not right! What is it? It's fine! Come on. Have a seat over here. It's fine! It's fine! Together! You guys would make the perfect husband and wife! I'm going to take another drink! Fast, you gotta do it fast! You're drinking too much! I'm gonna sleep! Do you think I'm some kind of bed? Marika-chan really cares about you! She's weak with sake... Her Mom died and since then I don't think she can date someone other than another villager. She's a good girl! Ginzo! Take Marika-chan home. I know that... Marika! Let's go home! Be safe! Hold on! Hold on! Fiance... Future daughter-in-law... An announcement! The event for senior high school students for this year have been decided! Johnny live! There's no helping it! But...I'm still gonna do it! We need to make it exciting for everyone else! Alright! Let's decide the groups! Johnny live? Every year there is an annual live. It's his Dad! His Dad? Don't say that man! He's famous! No he's not! I can't imagine that at all... He looks just like him. No he doesn't! Hey guys! Check it out! Check it out! This is Namio's manga release for this month! That's amazing! You're a professional Manga writer Namio-kun? Yeah! That's amazing! I'll read it out to you! That's amazing! Amazing! No, no! That's still not enough! I won't stop here. Hey.. Tokyo is calling me! Well...there's nothing here after all. All we got is mountains out here. I wonder? Isn't Ueno an amazing place? There's nothing here. I mean... There's such a beautiful river here and... The air is so fresh and you can really see the stars here! And the vegetables are so yummy! The vegetables are yummy. Besides there's a manga artist and Johnny idol here! You're a super famous idol aren't you? I'm not! This is all amazing! That's right! Let's make a promotional video for Ueno! PV? What does that mean? Behind the live group and the stage we can have a huge screen like a movie! And then we can have a video that introduces people to Ueno! There's going to be a ton of people at the festival right? In that case let's allow everyone to get to know Ueno even more! Satsuki do you have free time after this? Yeah I'm free. What about you Yuko? I have free time. Alright, then let's start collecting data! Hey! Marika-san is your future wife isn't she? You're talking about that? It's just our parents arranging it for us! Is that right? They're always bothering us with that. Hey! Ginzo! Is that right? Ginzo! Have you eaten yet? No I haven't yet.... Alright! Can you really make this? It's okay! My Grandma taught me this when I was young. It's going to be yummy! Thanks for the food! Go ahead. It's yummy! Really? You really are her granddaughter! This can be sold at the store! Right? You have a photo album! Can I see it? No, don't look at that! Please! It's fine! Please! My bad.... Sorry... Ginzo? Did you make all of these Ginzo? You even made that shop card? Yep... That's amazing! That's amazing! I thought a brand name company made it! You have talent Ginzo! Those are just sketches... Hey! After you graduate high school you should come to Tokyo! There's a lot of art schools in Tokyo! And not only schools but a lot of job opportunities too! Oh, Rio-chan! Marika-san.... Don't just barge in here like that! It's fine! I always do it anyways! Is this today's Soba? I wanna eat some too! I guess I have no choice! Thanks! It's not going to be good if Ginzo's heart gets swayed. I'm chosen for Ginzo's future. You're a Tokyo girl and you're not going to be here after summer so... Things would just get complicated. There you go! Soba! Soba! Gin-chan made all of those right there. I have no clue on how to make that kind of stuff. He's a talented young man. Gin-chan has always wanted to be a poster designer since he was a child... But eventually he stopped saying he wanted to be one. Why? He is the son of a long generation of liquor store owners... He's seen a lot of young people go out to Tokyo... And he's probably thinking he's the only one who can carry things on in this town. He's a boy who puts a lot of responsibility on his shoulders after all. We should film it with a Canon huh? Hey... I've been to Tokyo once before. It was only for a school trip though. How can I say this? I was just scared out of my mind. The buildings were huge and there were swarms of people. But then I thought...if one of my projects touched the hearts all of those people... How would I feel? It's a little bit crazy when you think about it. What am I telling you? But like...you're the only one I've told this to Rio. I like you... I like you Ginzo. Sorry! I just got carried away in the moment! She confessed to him! That's the first time I've seen it happen! I can use this for my Manga.... Hey! What are you doing? You're so cool Rio-chan! When you jumped off the bridge into the river... I could feel that same courage here! What are you saying? There's no way she was serious! Are you sure? Of course! She's never even been here for that long! Right? It's a joke...(I'm serious!) Dummy! I decided that I will go there on August third! Okay! I'll be waiting! Also...Kanon-kun was telling me how he wants to see you! Alright! Kanon-kun would like to say a few words! Go ahead! Hurry up and say it! Hurry up! This is Kanon Yuma! She knows that! I would like an ice cream cone please! Yeah. This is a good shot. Rio-chan... There was such a beautiful view of the river here? I'm sorry....for calling it a joke and stuff. I'm very happy you told me that. But... We live in different worlds. And the things that are precious to us are different. I...like this town. There are things I have to do here. That's why... I'm not thinking about that kind of stuff right now. Just so you know... I'm popular in Tokyo! Sometimes guys will hit on me and try to ask me out. What the heck? Tokyo is scary... Let's spend the rest of the summer having fun!! That's youth... Summer is still not over until the end of July! Rio! Aya! Oh, Souta-kun too! Good afternoon! Long time no see! You came a long way Aya-san. It was so far away! I was surprised! Sorry about that Aya-chan... I'm glad you came! So happy! Rio! Oh, Ginzo! Ginzo-san! Is that a friend from Tokyo? Yeah! Hey...who is that hottie? He's the guy who is always working at the liquor shop. Is that right? What is it? You look like you're into him. No I don't! He's close with my Grandma. Is that right? Hey! Hurry up! Hurry up! I brought them here. Are you surprised? Yeah... Why did you? You're surprised? Actually...we started dating. Isn't that right Aya-chan? Right? No way...congratulations! Thanks! Thanks! Say something to her! Have you been doing well? Yeah..I am. That's it? You have something else to say don't you? T-the mountains here are amazing... Isn't that obvious? Look at the birds! Those are called Kingfishers. Kingfisher? Hey, you made me break that! Hey Rio-chan. The food is ready! I'm going to get some meat. I'll take that. Here! Thanks! Hey...you should eat too Kanon-kun! I like doing this. But this place is nice isn't it? But it must have been tough coming all the way out here... You have to transfer buses a lot... Not at all. I get to see you after all. Ginzo! Have you taken some good pics? Yeah... Tokyo is like that after all huh? What do you mean? That guy... He's just over there being all sweet and charming. He's a playboy. Ginzo...you're acting kind of strange. Not really... I just thought "That is so Tokyo.." Just so you know...you're a lot more of a playboy! I can tell by just looking at you! Rio-chan! Wanna go over there? Are you okay? Thanks! This place is scary isn't it? Thanks! You and Ginzo-san are pretty close huh? You think so? Just like you told us before... Is he your fated encounter? He's not! He's not! Ginzo is not like that! You're so easy to read Rio-chan.... How did you meet him? It's nothing special at all... He gave me his shop card at first. And then... He took me to see the river and the bridge... That's pretty much it. That's it? That's your "fate"? If you're fine with something like that... Then I'll take you wherever! It could be a river or a bridge or anything else! Hey Rio-chan. Would you go out with me? Announcement time! Gather around! Gather around! So the ones who are going to clean up... I want to have a competition against the Tokyo team and the Ueno team to decide who cleans! The Ueno team is... Ginzo! You go! Show them the power of Ueno! Ginzo-san huh? What are we gonna do? I'll go! Kanon is going! It's been decided. I told Rio-chan that I want to date her. I thought about having a competition with you before I go back to Tokyo. I have the distance advantage. Are you guys ready? Don't lose Yuu! Ready.... Start! Go for it! Just like that Ginzo! Do your best! And the last one is... It's a tie... Was that a tie? What happened Ginzo? You were the best candidate for Ueno! Since it's a tie everyone is going to clean up right? That's right. Well...you did good! You did good! Tokyo put up a good fight. You were amazing Kanon-kun! Ginzo! What's wrong? Alright...it's done! Thank you. If you get hurt you need to tell us right away! Hey! Rio-chan? Don't you like me? Well... You don't even like me... That's unfair! You're unfair Ginzo! What am I doing? Aya is leaving. Make it back safely. Let's have fun when I get back to Tokyo. Let's do that! Let's do that! Hurry and come back! Rio-chan! Is it okay if I get it this time? I'll be waiting for you in Tokyo. Bye! Bye! What should we do now? I'm starving! I know right? What should we eat? Soba! Soba? That sounds good! I told Rio-chan that I want to date her. I thought about having a competition with you before I go back to Tokyo. It's so hot! I'm home! Mom! Have you two been doing well? Yeah. Is your job going well? I got some time off. Where's your grandma? She's at a group meeting right now. Is that Gin-chan? Long time no see. You've gotten so big! And you've become such a cute boy! Yes? This is Funami. She's the same as always... You got that right... Oh! A souvenir! What could it be? Yes, hold on one second. I understand. I can do it right away. I'll send it by today. Yes, pardon me! Ummm... With this kind of job... You won't be able to do it if you stop studying the proper skills huh? Are you interested? Well... What do you want to drink? Anything is fine. Welcome! This looks so yummy! Excuse me! I'd like this! Okay! That will be 900 yen! Here! I'm kinda tired. This is cute! You can take it if you'd like. Can I get another one? Yes! Here you go! Good work! Thank you! Hey..I should put this on instagram shouldn't I? You think so? Isn't it pretty ordinary? It seems very countryside-like. You think so? There is an urgent change in plans! To tell you the truth... Advertising is not enough for the Johnny group...I'm under pressure! It's a senior event... They're telling me they want more young customers! How are we going to do that? Gin-chan made all of those for everyone. Are you interested? Excuse me? Funami Rio! How about we make a festive flyer? We can give it a more fashionable look! I see...that could work! Ginzo! You'll make it right? Me? That's good! Ginzo can do it! Right everyone? The Izumi shop card is pretty good! It's going to be super cute! I've never done something like this before. I'm talking about the flyer for the live. Well..it is a festival so I'll get it done. What about these here? Didn't you get these done? The stuff you make is amazing! It's cool and it's very eye catching! This! This one right here... It really caught my eye! I'm not as awesome as you say I am. I don't have the confidence that someone like Namio has for putting out results. Whether I have talent or not... Is something I can find out if I go to Tokyo. That's why I'm scared to go... If you think about the future... Then you are going to waste all the time you have in the present! Let's just say that things don't work out when you go to Tokyo... Then you could just come back here and take over the liquor store right? It's not that simple... Is having insurance lame to you? But... It's okay to be lame! Nobody lives a life without being lame! Hey... I... You're amazing! Do you have free time tomorrow? Do you want to go see the fireworks together? I was thinking of taking some photos for the flyer... Yeah...I'll go! I'll help you out! The firework festival huh? That sounds good! Alright, it's done! But I wonder if it seems like I'm too flashy? Why's that bad? It's good to be flashy. Your 16th summer is going to end. You're cute! Thanks. There's a lot of people huh? That's right. That's a good place for taking pictures. Let's go check it out. Hold on to this. That's amazing! It's so cute... What should it's name be? Ginzo? I'm sorry! Excuse me! Excuse me! Rio! Ginzo... I was freaking out... Me too... I thought I lost you for good... Sorry for losing you like that. I told you about my field trip to Tokyo right? At that time...I got left behind by everyone in Shibuya. Tokyo has some amazing signboards right? I was looking up the whole time and before I knew it, nobody was there. And then...I think I was close to a shrine... When I was lost...I happened to see some art on a wall. It was just a sunflower but I thought it was really cool! When I got separated from you I remembered that. I wonder if that artwork is still there? Drinking sake with you makes it so yummy! Be quiet! You went to Tokyo because of me. What are you doing right now? Is Rio-chan my daughter? No, no, no! We didn't date before then! When I think about it now...that was our youth huh? You aren't listening to me at all. You haven't changed at all! Hey.. What are you planning on doing with Gin-chan? Are you planning on making him give up his dream just like you did? It's not like I haven't noticed anything. But he doesn't tell me anything. If he doesn't have the resolve to stand up to me... Then he won't be able to do anything. Amazing! Amazing! It's so pretty! It's so big! That was the last one wasn't it? Shouldn't you have taken a picture of that? I really just wanted to bring you here is all. Ginzo... We can do whatever until summer break is over. When I go back to Tokyo you can just pretend nothing happened. Would you go out with me? Let's go back. I don't want to go back! If I go back now then I'm going to waste my summer... I want to be with you more...forever! You're saying until summer ends.... That's cruel to me! Let's go back. Sup! Hey..hey! Do you have goldfish food? I thought you were the one who got the Goldfish. No, it wasn't me. I won it yesterday as a prize. You went? You went to the firework festival huh? Goldfish food huh? Do we have some? I remember we had an order for it recently... Hey Ginzo. You like Ueno don't you? I found it! It's a little bit dusty but it should still be okay! Here you go! That will be 200 yen! Thank you! You're not going to go anywhere are you? Of course not! Later! We had a lot of fun didn't we? Hey Mom, I put your stuff in the trunk! I wish I had a little more time off work. Here you go! This is the last thing. Thanks! I'll leave them to you! Be safe. And don't overwork yourself. Yep! Be safe too. Oh, that's right! If anything happens then call me. I will come back here if something does happen. Later! Okay, I'm ready! Roger that! Later! (Later!) Be safe! Okay! Alright now.... Time for your homework! Sou-chan! Your homework! Homework...homework... Here.... Take this. Than...(Later!) Hey! Thanks! I'm sure the Kinzo is happy too! Kinzo? You're the one who got the goldfish Ginzo! So his name is Kinzo! I'm sure for saying something weird yesterday. Later! Saying things like "Until summer is over.." Means nothing. Be with me. With you? I love you... I understand it clearly from your voice. My heart tells me I do not want to forget. I want to make a lot more memories. I want to be with you forever. Is it okay if I'm a crybaby? You don't have to be strong. Even if it's short term love... I'm happy that I met you. Forever... Forever... I pray that this will continue forever. Even if you do not take my hand... I love you. Your dreams give you a peace of mind. You told me you don't want to wake up from them. I want to make more memories with you. I want to stay with you tomorrow. Hey... Hold on! Hold on! You're making a good face! No way! No way! It's okay! Just get over here! Wherever.. Wherever... I want you to be close to the insensitive me. Of course I'm going to mess things up. I'm a child so I don't notice anything but... I want to properly like you. It's because I'm always expecting something good... That I endure all of this. If I overflow.. Look at me, look at me properly. Look at me. Your shadow will grow and grow. It's not going to disappear. These feelings will never change. Forever.. Forever... I pray that this will continue forever. Even if you do not take my hand... I love you too much I have to hug you. It would be good if my(If my) time just stopped. I'm biting my lips today... Don't end. Don't end summer! Why didn't you kiss me? If I'm just going to be with you until summer is over.. I don't really want to... Let's go! It's really pretty! If you make a wish here... Then it will definitely come true! This place is famous for that. What should I wish for? Although...it's only a one time thing. What are you going to wish for? Hmm...I wonder? Give my wish to Rio! That's good for you huh? Now you have two wishes. Make Ginzo's dream come true! I just gave you my wish too... It just went to waste! I wonder? But this is my dream too! What's the other one? Well... I'm not telling you! What the heck? There's no reason not to! Where's your seat? It's the one all the way in the back next to the window. The one all the way in the back next to the window? That's a good spot isn't it? That's right! The one all the way in the back next to the window huh? The wind feels good... Ginzo! Sit next to me! It's cute. That outfit. It looks good on you. I wish we went to the same school. That way...we would see each other every day... And we would wear our uniforms everyday. 2 days left huh? Good morning Rio-chan! Good morning! Do you have a minute? Yes... Hey... I know that there are things that Ginzo wants to do. But Ueko needs him. This is Ginzo's village. Don't you need him too? I know that! It's okay! Marika-chan! Good morning! Good morning! You came just in time! I want you to carry something! Sorry! Where is it? So cute! Hey! Don't eat it bro! Rio-chan! The end is coming huh? It's going to be so lonely saying goodbye to you.... I'm going to be lonely too! Let's take a picture! Alright...say cheese... Let's take another one. Ready...go! That looks nice. Announcement time! It's going to be time for the the long awaited Johnny live... Alright! Let's get everyone fired up! Alright! Do your best! After the live is over...let's go to the festival. Ginzo! I'll leave the final project check to you! Later! Geez... Next we have the long awaited Johnny live! Look forward to it! There's a lot of people this year! There's a lot of young people! They came because of your flyer! It got a lot of attention on Instagram. We got an okay! Let's get them fired up! Satsuki... This the year for Ueko! Alright! Are you guys ready for this year? Are you doing well? Let's get fired up! Thanks for waiting! We're gonna put on the best show! Summer isn't going to end! We are Ueko! Is this really okay? Thank you Ueko! Seeing everyone's smiles was the very best! We are Ueko! Thanks! Satsuki! Where's Rio? I haven't seen her now that you mention it... Grandma! Gin-chan! Do you know where Rio is? Grandma? To tell you the truth... Ginzo! But I mean...she said she was going tomorrow... She said that saying goodbye to everyone would be sad. Rio! Rio! What's this about? Why are you going without saying anything? Rio! Rio! Just like that...the 31st of August ended. And our blue summer was over. Morning! Rio! Long time no see! Hey, hey, hey... What happened after that? You were right after all. A fated person doesn't exist after all. I was just a high school girl. How's it going with your boyfriend? I'm sure you will find a good person! Really? Just try it out! Were you happy with your pick? Not at all. But like...check this out. Isn't that pretty bad? Let's go! Let's go! University choice. I can't hear anything! I'm not going to listen to anything you say! Listen to me! No way! I don't want to listen to you! Just so you know! Even I can jump off the bridge too! Marika... Marika! Save me... You know I can't swim! You're full of stories Marika! You can actually swim can't you? I've made up my mind! I like Ueko after all! It's been good to me. Even I want to support what the person I like wants to do! But... If that means that you're going to leave me... Go to Tokyo and do whatever you want! Rio-chan! Long time no see. Kanon-kun... There's a place where I want to take you to. Can we go right now? Do you come to Harajuku often? I don't really come here often but... I've come here with Takuya and Fuku recently though. Oh, is that right? Do you come here often? School is close by! Is that right? Then...what do you normally do after school? What's wrong? How about we go over there for a change of pace? I'm in the swimming club but.. That's why you were so fast. Gin-chan...I think you should go to the Tokyo school of arts instead. You might still be able to make it in. Really? You still need some improvement but you do have talent. Thank you! Here! Hey Gin-chan. Have you told Rio that you came to Tokyo? Please don't tell Rio this. Why? I still don't know if I'll pass yet. If I'm able to properly start up my own dream.. Then I'll let her know. Is that so? I didn't know about this. You can walk over Rainbow bridge huh? You live in Tokyo but you didn't know that. I've always wanted to show you this Rio-chan. Bridges in Tokyo are nice too aren't they? Well...you can't jump over them though... Sorry Kanon-kun.... Right now, I... Want to show Ginzo this beautiful scenery.... Eating good food.... Finding new things... When I see beautiful scenery.. I think to myself "What would Ginzo say right now?" I want to show Ginzo this... That's what I think. I'm sorry... Earlier... I saw Ginzo-san in Harajuku. He might be your fated one just like you said. Go to him. Thanks. Kanon-kun. My other wish is that I want to kiss you! Everyone left me behind in Shibuya. I think it was by a shrine. When I was lost I found some art on a wall. I wonder if that artwork is still there? Why are you here? Why... Why didn't you call me? Dummy! Dummy... Didn't you just leave without telling me? I mean... I bowed my head to my Dad. I told him to give me more time. If I graduate next year... I've decided I'm going to come to Tokyo. I'll show you that I can become a designer! I want people to see my work just like they did at the festival in Ueko. You gave my dream back to me after all! That's why... I want you to wait for me until next year. Rio... I like you. I like you too. I love you! There is a fated encounter. There is a fate that you find. But I think that the fate that you create for yourself is also good! Thanks for watching! Like my Facebook page at Rjgman56 japanese drama subs for updates!
