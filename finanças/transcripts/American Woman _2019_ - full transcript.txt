Open the door. They tell me you won't have visitors. Not even your own father. Why did you ask for me? Could you get this to her? They're throwing the book at her, you know. Her lawyer may try to see you. Get your help. I'd sure like to know why you girls are so goddamn mad. ...fire ricocheted across the parking lot. Store clerks recognized the shooter as the kidnapped heiress, whose conversion to a radical cause has captivated the nation this year. We're coming to you now live from East Los Angeles, where local and federal law enforcement have surrounded what is thought to be a safe house of the kidnappers who call themselves the "PAL." The People's Army of Liberation. That's Los Angeles? They broke into Match Game. I mean, this is happening right this minute. It's that Army of People's Liberation, or whatever they call themselves. Radicals. And that poor, brainwashed girl. "Brainwashed"? Oh, Iris, read a newspaper once in a while. They snatched her from her own home at gunpoint. Next thing you know, they got her running around with them robbing banks. Surely, you've heard them on the radio? Their communiques. "Mom, Dad, I'm joining the revolution!" I'm alive. God only knows what they did to her. How do you know she doesn't really agree with them? Do you know who her grandfather is? Who her people are? A girl like that doesn't really change. Not a girl from that family. I'm hearing explosions. I'm hearing ammunition in the house blowing up. What I presume to be ammunition. The house is engulfed in flames. No one is getting out of there alive, I'm afraid. A tragic end to this very dramatic story. Oh, I'm going to need a yellow croquet ball. And I won't pay for a whole new set. I just want the one. You could go into the city if you have to. I understand that they have everything down in Chinatown there. "Dear Michael, "I love you. "I miss you. "It's hard hiding. "Hiding who I am, holding my tongue... "I don't know how much longer I can stand it. "I never wanted to be in this alone. "I need money or friends. "I don't have either. "Please write back." Iris? Iris, is that you? I hope you got lemons. Ah. And I see you picked up my pills. Good. What about my croquet ball? You were right, they have them in Chinatown. I knew it. Oh, and, Iris, somebody came by today looking for you. I hope you recall our agreement about room and board. Of course. No male visitors. It must be a mistake. What do you mean a mistake? How could it be a mistake? How many Oriental girls are there living in Upstate New York, do you think? What's the matter with you? Housekeeping. I'm not wearing a wire. Might be happy to see a friendly face. All my friends are in prison. How'd you find me? Some of those friends get letters from you. I figured you must have a go-between. Sharon sold me out? All she did was give me a post office box. And then only after I swore that I just wanted to help you. - I don't need help. - Why, because you have a plan? You saw this. - The safe house is burned. - Everybody saw it. Those poor people. They were good at getting attention, but does anyone really know what they were fighting for? Couple of those people weren't in the house. That girl is alive. Pauline? Her and a couple of the others. I've got them stashed in a safe house in the middle of nowhere up north. Are you out of your mind? Those are the most-wanted people in America. Exactly. It's a sensational story. They're gonna write a book. And I'm gonna publish it. They need someone to take care of the everyday things while they write. So, you know... Grocery shopping. Someone who knows how to hide. You came from them to me? Come on, you believe in their principles even if their tactics are a little far-out. They kidnapped her! Liberated her! And she calls it that. Come on. You're broke, you're alone. You can't go on like this. You're lucky it was me who found you. You know, as well as I do, if the Feds kick down the door, they won't bother to take you alive. Think of the deal I could get right now with what you just told me. They'd drop all the charges. I know you'd never sell anyone out. Six weeks. And then anything you want. Their book could do what we always wanted. How much does it pay? President is going down. Everyone knows he's a liar. Everyone knows it was a disgraceful war. A lot of people hated the war. They wrote letters, they marched. Not everyone did what I did. Get yourself the right lawyers. The right lawyers cost money. Get the book done. You'll have the best lawyers money can buy. Pauline does that. Keeps her calm. I'm Jenny. How long have you been underground? Couple years? I got a lot to learn. News is the manhunt's still in California. You've been spotted in Alberta, Tijuana, but nowhere east. Juan? Baby? This is Jenny. Michael Fisher's girlfriend. Did Frazer bring cigarettes? Hey. I'm Jenny. You make bombs. I used to. Juan says you bombed an office building. It was a draft office. A government target. It was the middle of the night. What the fuck am I supposed to do with one gun? This isn't one of your campus protests, man. You can't leave us defenseless. They murdered our comrades. This is a war. There's a time to rise up, there's also a time to lie low. Folks want to get behind you. Your book is gonna reach them. And fund your struggle as a bonus. He's right. We need to survive. - Thanks, man. - Okay. I'll take the pickup and leave the Beetle. It's clean. I thought maybe they could dictate the book, you could, uh, type it up. Just get them writing. You need to eat. I'm too tired. I can't sleep with all the mice. Eat. Our brothers and sisters all over the world survive on only one bowl of rice a day. Yeah, not like the fat pigs you grew up with, gorging themselves. Frazer brought newspapers. He thought you might want to read how they reported the fire. We watched it on TV. Our comrades burned alive while America sat eating their TV dinners. Search and destroy. That wasn't just something that happened. Let me tell you, that's a fucking policy. Juan fought alongside his black brothers in Vietnam. He saw things. You could write about that. About what? About the war, how it changed your thinking. You could write about how you grew up with so much and how little you need now. If you could change, maybe anyone can. The newspapers get it all wrong. They interviewed your parents while your comrades burned. What did they die for? What did they believe in? "You were the man of my dreams..." It sounds like a Hallmark card, "the man of my dreams..." No, it's romantic. She falls in love and... "You were the man of my dreams." Juan: Says who? "Evan, you were the man of my dreams. "We both grew up like birds in a golden cage. "Afraid that if we ever escaped, "we might not survive. "Like you, I'd always felt called upon "to fight the injustice, the racism. "Did I feel more called upon, "or less able to answer that call "because of whose daughter I was? "We had so much to overcome. "But you changed. "And you showed me I could change. "The poor man is our brother. "We are not afraid to pull your scraps from the trash." Where are you going? Hey. Hey! What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy? We gotta deliver the eulogy. Deliver to who? To the radio station. We need to get the word out there. - Where's the keys? - Not radio, a book. I can type it out for you. A-ha! You can't drive into town in broad daylight. You can't just mail it, it's basic! Don't tell him what to do. They won't arrest you. - They will kill you. - Do you fear death? - 'Cause I don't. - Where are you going? Our deaths will be righteous. I'm coming with you. No, you can't come with us. - Yes. - God damn it, I'll go. I'll go. There's a woman in the Midwest. She copies out my letters and mails them on. If you're caught now, it's the end of me, too. Okay. And get more wine! - You from Vietnam? - No. Huh. Just asking. Where you from? Never seen you around. New York. My brother went to Vietnam. What happened to him? He was fast, but the gooks were faster. You have a nice day, now. - Hello? - I've sent you something. When you get it, wear dishwashing gloves. Mail it to a radio station. I think it's something people need to hear. Shut up. You really shouldn't be doing that. You want a turn? No. The Orientals have exceptional aim. Great archers. Brace yourself, princess. They're saying she didn't even recognize her own mother at first. They're saying she was brainwashed. Seems to me, the main sign of being brainwashed is a sincerely-held belief that you have not been brainwashed. Maybe she was afraid. ...prepare to veto any bill that doesn't fit... Ego reconstruction tomorrow at dawn, then we'll do combat drills up in the woods. We don't have enough people for combat drills... We play each other, Yvonne gets you as a handicap. Fuck you. What'd you say? Jenny could join. Jenny doesn't want to do combat drills. She's a pacifist. You could be a real leader. You've got the chops. You've got the skin for it. My skin's got nothing to do with it. It's a privilege. Gives you a Third World perspective. I'm from California, Juan. You know what? You're too humble. Our leader, he was humble. He was also a hard-ass. I don't understand a pacifist that makes bombs. No one was ever hurt. So you were lucky. It wasn't luck. We were careful. Not careful enough. Your boyfriend went to prison. She's just jealous. The princess is a big step behind, and she likes to pretend that she isn't. Isn't that right? I said, isn't that right, princess? Yeah. Do you know how filthy rich that girl was? Her consciousness is our responsibility. What? Ugh. - Here, take care of it. - No, no! - Juan... - No, just let her do it. - Go ahead. - Stop! - Go ahead, go ahead. - Stop! Please! I can't, I can't... - Go ahead. - I can't, I can't! - Come on. - Juan... She needs to get her little, white hands dirty. I can hear them chewing. They made a hole. It's just mice. Hand me the tape. Tape it. Say please, princess. She's not your fucking maid. Thank you. Hey! Not-from-'Nam. Got enough wine to hold you this time? - What's your name anyway? - Alice. Thomas! I didn't see that. Don't forget to punch out. Already did, Mr. M. I'm sorry about your brother. Why? He was killed in a terrible war. A pointless war. Don't be mad, Alice, but I was just shitting you. My brother ain't dead. He was drafted. Then he ran off and never came back. So, it's like he's dead. My dad did the same thing. Refused the draft. But in World War II, he was angry that the government put the Japanese in camps. Who did? The government. After Pearl Harbor. They didn't teach us that at school. How much do they teach you about slavery? They didn't teach us shit about that. What happened to your dad? He went to prison for a couple of years. If my dad caught my bro, he'd wish he was in Vietnam. - Oh. Is this your old man? - No. - What are you doing here? - Who's this? Helping me with groceries. Hey, man. How you doin'? Good. What's your name, brother? - Thomas. - What are you doing, Thomas? Just saw Alice here and... It's a good thing I didn't make my move, right? Hey, you want a ride home? So, Thomas. You know me? You've seen me before, yeah? I don't think so. All white people look alike to you? I don't think so. You work for the Man, Thomas? - Sure. - No, you see, you should work for the People. Your people. My people don't own a grocery store. Where's your house, Thomas? Tell you something. Alice here, she ain't my old lady, so... So you still got a chance. She's my sister-in-arms. She's been helping me out. I had a feeling she was helping out someone. She was doing some extensive grocery shopping. Do you want to help me out, too? Sounds serious. Is there a bank out by your store? I guess so. Mr. Morton makes the night deposit. - Mr. Morton's your boss? - That's my house. I hope to see you again, Alice. - Cigarette, Thomas? You sure? - No, I'm good, man. Thanks. You know, Jenny, the war is over, but there'll be more wars. And with the draft gone, it'll just be poor kids like that kid back there going off to fight. While the rich kids stay home getting richer. Sometimes the only way things change is if you force them to change. What are you making? A mousetrap. I see why you were good at making bombs. Cut it out, princess. It's a compliment. I said, cut it out. Don't talk to her like that. Don't tell me how to fucking talk. You can't just sit around waiting to die or be caught. You have to start writing. Write the book, get the money. It's the only way you're gonna survive underground. Turn it up. Turn it up! ...in a Los Angeles safe house last month. The poor man is our brother. We are not afraid to pull your scraps from the trash. Another apparent survivor of the shootout issued a violent threat. After slaughtering our comrades in a battle of 100-to-1, we read that the chief picked our shotgun shells from the rubble. Do you desire a souvenir, pig? We've got something better for you. Vengeance for our slain comrades. Blood for blood. Bullet for bullet. The search for the fugitives is... Hello? I made a mistake. Hey. Don't do this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please... What are you... What are you doing with those people? The FBI is talking to everyone you used to know. Don't mail me anything ever again. I'm not your go-between anymore. Please. You're my only link to Michael. Please, Sharon. Don't say my fucking name. Don't ever call me again. New ideas in the air around me... New ideas, real ideas, and slowly I began to understand... ...the travesty of my former life. I heard a voice reading the stirring words of Karl Marx, Eldridge Cleaver, George Jackson. I longed to see the face of this kind and wise comrade. I begged him to take off my blindfold... No blindfold. No blindfold? She falls in love with him through the words. We have to know why she can't see him. I don't care if she fell in love with the words or with his big dick. No blindfold. You already said I couldn't be in the closet. For the last fucking time, it was a fucking pantry. Well, how would I know? I had a blindfold on the whole fucking time. You did? On the radio, you said you let her exercise. Read the newspaper. Eat with you. You said you were honoring the Geneva Conventions. She had to be blindfolded in the beginning so she couldn't ID us. That is standard. It's for her protection. How long were you in a closet? It wasn't a closet! I don't know what I thought, but not... Sister, you can see for yourself, Pauline is not some helpless prisoner. I'm more committed than you are. Hey, don't you dare talk to Jenny that way. I would like to see you do half of what Jenny has done. Are you kidding? The only reason why you think she's so great, - is because of her skin. - You watch your mouth. Why don't you shut your fucking trap, princess? Don't tell me what to do. Just stay out of it. Maybe she was afraid. Oh, she says she was scared the whole time. Afraid for her family. Her sisters. Says they told her they'd kill them if she even imagined getting rescued. I meant, afraid of you. Don't you know where all this leaves you? Good morning. One fucking gun. What do you do with one gun? Anything you want. You just have to get in and get out fast. Twenty hijackings every year, you never hear about it. Government doesn't want you to know how easy it is. They cover it up. If we go to Cuba, we wouldn't have to hide. We could get a place. We could write our book. We could keep the fight alive. We'd be alive. We've been so lucky this whole time. How you rode a desk over in 'Nam. How we weren't at the safe house when the Feds came. We can't... Hide. Sure smells good. I'm Bob. - Hi. - Hi. I'm the owner. Oh, I'm Jane. Uh, good morning. Hi. Uh... I thought... You know, I'm sorry, I'm pretty lousy with names... Deirdre was going to be here with her kids all summer. Yeah, uh, she took the kids to her mother... I thought I might as well check-in and see if there's anything anybody needed. - If everything's okay. - No, we're fine. And I always, like... I always... Hello. I always like to have a number. Hey. Hey. Wow. Um... Hi, I'm Bob. Good to meet ya. - You too. - Yeah, how're you doin'? I was just driving upstate and I thought I might as well check-in. My wife and I grew up in these parts. - Welcome back. - Thanks. Well, what do you say to, uh, taking a walk down memory lane? Yeah, maybe I'll go and see if the crick's runnin' low this year. Yeah, I'll come along with you. Haven't had much of a chance to explore yet. You know, I think that, um, Bob's looking to walk alone. You are not paying rent on this place to have me bother you. So, you have a wonderful summer. You too. Yeah, take care now. I'll call Frazer from town. Making coffee. You want some? Didn't want to lay our plan on you until we had it all formed and it was firm in my mind how things would go. We need to carry on the fight, but we'll need money to survive. You've been solid, so you're in. - "In"? - On the plan. We're going to hit that kid's store. Rob his boss on our way out of town. Yvonne, does this sound like a smart idea to you? His boss makes the deposit himself. We'll approach right when he's closing. Easy. Are you out of your minds? We want to make it up to you that you'll never get your cut for the book. No. We know that's why you're here. You've got to survive just like we do. No. I will not commit armed robbery, Juan. Give me the car keys, Jenny. You can go. Or you can stay and wait for Frazer. But this... This is over. Wait! - Just let me go, Pauline. - Jenny! Wait! He's not gonna let you just walk away. He thinks you're going to rat us out. Princess! He will kill me if you leave. Please, Jenny. Please! Princess, you better get back in that house in three seconds. - One, two... - Jenny's in. She'll do it. She'll hot-wire the car. Oh, well. Now, back in the house, both of you! Let's go, princess. You don't need her, Juan. You better be here when we get back. Let go! Grab her! Stop, stop! Stop! Jesus... Get her in! Come on, come on. Don't leave me, please. Oh, God, oh, God. Oh, God. What happened? Get in the car. Let's go... What happened? Oh, God, oh, God. Oh, God, oh, God. Oh, God. - She's good. She's good. She's good. - What happened? - Whose blood is that? - Go, go, go, go. Drive, Jenny. Now! - It's okay. - Juan, whose blood is that? Is he dead? Is he dead? No, no, no. He's gonna be fine. He's gonna be fine. Slow down, slow down. Don't speed. Take us back. Back to the farmhouse. Just take us back. Is he dead? He's okay. He's okay. He's gonna be okay. Let's go. Come on, come on. You're okay. He is okay. - He's dead. - No, no, no. He's not. Get in the car. Get in the car! Pauline, get in the car. Get in the car. Get in the car! Get in the car. I can't. I can't, I can't, I can't. Get... Hey! Hey! Stop! Jenny! Stop! Did Yvonne shoot someone? That kid's boss, is he dead? An innocent man... Wipe down the car. Wait here for me. I've called the police. Well, I'll be. Iris. Back to rob me, are ya? I suppose you've got your young man out in the bushes. I need to buy your car. I can offer you $200. It's quarter after 4:00 in the morning. And my car is worth much more than that. You don't drive, that's why you hired me. $400, that's the least I can do. I bought that car brand-new. You owe me three months' wages. A few weeks' notice is the norm. 250, and I'll leave you my car. You know you need the money. I said wait! This is my friend from New Jersey. My friend, Ann. Iris... I never took you for an outlaw. $300. Cash. And I'll consider it a favor to you. My parents will help us. I'll drive you to California, but I don't want their help. Did you ever send your father a sign? No. I haven't spoken to him in years. Even before I went underground, he thinks I made them write that we aren't loyal to our country, to this country. Did Juan ever explain ego reconstruction to you? It's a game or something. It's a trust exercise. The way that it works is you... You say "time," and then the other person has one minute to say anything they like. Like lifting up a lid to your mind. A minute can last a long time. Okay. You could just say one thing. Okay. I'll go first. - You ready? - I'm ready. Time. I wish you'd say one thing, as long as it's true. That's it? Yes, it is. Okay, time. After I'd been with the cadre for a while, our leader posed the question, whether or not I should join them. Juan and Yvonne voted no. Juan said that I would never fight to the death, and Yvonne said if I was ever caught, I would probably rat them all out. Mom. Dad. You should know I'm being treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention, because these people believe I'm a prisoner of war. A war you might not think you're fighting, Dad, but you are. I know you don't like to think about it. The whole system depends on you not thinking about it. I have been given a choice. The choice of being set free in a safe area, or of joining forces with the cadre to fight. But I've realized something. That's right. You can't be given freedom. You have to fight for it. I have chosen to stay and fight. Our leader divided us up into groups of three. He put me with Juan and Yvonne. And then he sent us out on this mission. Not a real mission, it was like a supply run. But I think, really, it was like a test. Juan said that if I ever ran away, he'd go personally to kill my sisters. What the hell are you doing? Get off me! Get off him! Get off him! Fucking pig! Get off! Let him go! I need some backup here! I need some backup now! Come on, baby. That's where we were when the FBI was surrounding the safe house. All the police and the FBI... There were no negotiations. And when the ammo in the house started to blow... ...they just let it burn. I wasn't inside the safe house. But the police thought I was. And they let them all burn alive. Do you think it's safe driving in this? Maybe we should find a place to stop for the night. You lied to me. Back at the farmhouse. You lied. Juan never would have killed you. Or me. I could have just walked away. Why didn't you just let me go? You needed a ride. You would have said anything. Damn it. Shit. Damn it! Pauline! Pauline! - Hey! - Pauline! Pauline! You have to hide! You have to hide! He radioed the state police! You have to hide! Go! - They're on their way! - Now is your chance! I'll stay, it's me they want! Just go, Jenny! Go! I'll never sell you out, I promise! I'll never sell you out! Please, Jenny, just go! It's over! You the girls who caused all this trouble? Yes, sir. Heard you need a jump-start. I don't want you to say anything in response to what I'm about to tell you. She's naming you as an accessory to the murder of a grocery-store owner in Monticello, New York. I don't believe it. Well, she's her father's daughter. She's realized the adventure is over. She's naming names. She's naming everyone she ever met. Sandy. Tom. Some guy named Rob Frazer. Your friends at the farmhouse, we've got them in custody. They're saying they don't know you, never even heard of you. It's funny who your friends turn out to be. You're lying. ♪ Well, I met him on a Sunday ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ And I missed him on Monday ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ Well, I found him on Tuesday ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ And I dated him Wednesday ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ I said, "Bye bye, baby"... ♪ Pelicans! They're beautiful! There were at least three of 'em that I interacted with. There could have been more. And they were just like hippies, you know. Kind of just hippies. I don't know when they left, but they paid through the whole summer. A house doesn't get wiped clean like this by accident. I've got a clear partial here. Right index finger, middle finger. Well, that's a pretty old mattress. It could have been my wife, we were trying to fix it up years ago. "June 12, 1974." Jesus! Would you look at this? Get that to the lab. Do a search on known radicals on the East Coast. And Wisconsin. The Midwest. I got a whole handprint. Do the whole damn country. What can I get you? I'll take a whiskey. Rocks? Neat. Little splash of water. Another one, Jimmy. Ladies. Next one's on me. This is our last one. Where you girls headed? - New York. - Casper. I don't care for Casper, guess I'm a country boy at heart. Now, New York, you'd have to bind me and gag me and carry me to get out there. I don't even know how they live in there. You? It's harder if you're used to wide-open spaces. Yes. We better get going. Gotta get to Casper tonight. Come on, one game of pool before you go. Let's do it. Okay. Did you go through Jackson on the interstate? No. We like the back roads. It's your break. You know what you're doing. You hit the white. That's right. It's not bad, for a girl. So what are you? If you don't mind my asking. She's a person. Crow Indian. No... Eskimo. She's Californian. How come you don't ask me what I am? Oh, I know what you are. You're a girl called Trouble with a capital T. Get us another drink. Little splash of water. Yes, ma'am. I don't want to be an outlaw. Outlaws always die at the end of the story. I want to be in a comedy. There's always a wedding at the end of a comedy. We have to go. Aw, don't leave. It's a waste of whiskey. She wouldn't have been using her own name, I don't think. Oh... They all look alike to me. Mind if I take a look in there? It's just an old thing I haven't driven in years. I know that's your car. It was stolen last summer in San Diego. I've got the police report around here somewhere. And I know who you gave it to. I don't know any of those people. You wanna take another look? Never seen her, man. Police. No! No. "I think of a monk. "A Buddhist monk I saw on the news who set himself on fire. "In protest against the horror of killing, of war. "That sight shocked me "more than anything else in my life." It changed everything. "I thought I knew what he was doing. "But maybe I was wrong." What? You? Wrong? I thought he wanted to shock us. Make us see him. But what if he meant something else? - It's better as a question. - Police! Freeze! Hey, freeze! Freeze! Freeze, God damn it, or I'll blow her head off! I got 'em, I got 'em. Stop! - Pauline! - Jenny! Jenny! Don't! You think that's how you change things? You really think that's how you change people's minds? Why did you come here? That's my little girl. She keeps running away from boarding school. Says she wants to come out here and live with me. Hates her mom, hates her stepdad, hates the whole goddamn thing. She says this country's built on Negro bodies and dead Indians. Her whole life growing up, you had the war, the cities on fire, that pimp Manson on TV right during dinner. Never had a president who didn't lie every time he opened his goddamn mouth. Please. Don't help her lawyer if he comes around. Defense will be she was always just a prisoner. But I think you and I both know that's not the case. It's her they want, nobody cares about you. Frankly, I think they'd go easy if you help them put her away. Take my advice. Cut a deal. Save yourself. Now, you and the defendant were together for approximately eight months, is that correct? Yes. And you traveled together across the country from New York to California, correct? Yes. Now, during this time, in your opinion, was the defendant malnourished? She smoked a great deal and rarely ate. Was she deprived of sleep? Yes. Was she frightened? Objection. I'll rephrase. Do you think she was capable of freely making decisions? I think she made one decision. I think she decided not to die. Would you say, in general, in your opinion, that the defendant was a captive during this time? I thought... I thought she was something else. But she was a captive. She was always a captive. She was found guilty of her crimes. And I was, too, of mine. She went to prison, and so did I. Then she got out, and so did I. Later, she got married to one of her bodyguards. And me... I watched it on TV.
