It's near where im going I?ll give you a ride if you say 'please' Could you give me a ride, please? Climb up! - It?s cold tonight, huh? - Yes. Have you waited a long time for a car? Not long. A quarter of an hour, maybe. It?s that my... - A quarter of an hour? - My car broke down. You don?t say! What a pity. What is it, was your car a mess, or what? No, the truth is that... well, I don?t know anything about mechanics, but... Just like myself... - Where do you live exactly? - By the riverside. By the riverside? There's a few houses, lined up. - Do you know them? - The ones the built recently? - Well, yeah. Relatively. - Yeah, yeah I know. - It?s a long walk till there, isn?t it? - Yeah. - Have you been to work or something? - Yes. What's your profession? - I sell encyclopedias. - Yeah? That's swell... - Spreading the culture, huh? - Yes... Oh, I was going to say something but I forgot. Ah, yes! Do you want to have a cup of coffee? - What? - I'll buy you coffee, come on. Where? Well... there is a gas station ahead and there?s a caf? next to it. See... I think it?s better I arrive home as soon as possible. Come on, we won?t be staying there for long. - Really, it?s too late. - Okay, as you wish. A coffee is not going to kill you. That?s not it. I worked hard today and I?m very tired. Tomorrow I get up early. What you need is a strong hot coffee. It will cheer you up! No, seriously. I don?t think that?s a good idea.They?ll kill me at home. Why is that? You can call from the cafeteria! Really. The last thing i need is drinking coffee. Also... it won't let me sleep later. I see. You can also have a camomile tea or a glass of milk.Okay, okay, I'll stop bugging you. - Sorry. - No, no, I just wanted to be nice. I know, and I appreciate it. Maybe another time. - What time is it? - I think it?s eleven o? clock...yes. - I don?t carry a watch. - So, you must be always late then. I like to make others wait. Besides... What?s wrong? I?m not feeling well. It must be the lunch. I?m sorry. Calm down. Do you think you have to vomit? It?s no use. I have a chronic stomach ache. I had anorexia as a child, you know? Maybe you could use some fresh air. No, what I need right now is a hot camomile tea. Do you mind? - Good evening. - Good evening. - I'm going to the bathroom. - Okay. A coffee with milk and a camomile tea, please. Teresa! Hi, it?s me! Yes, I know, but the car broke down on my way home. I am in a cafeteria now. No, I hitchhiked and a girl gave me a ride. It may take me a little longer to get back home. Yes, I?ll tell you later. No, I can?t right now. Hey, what do you mean? Teresa, it?s not what you... Teresa, you are misinterpretating all this. Teresa? Shit! - Who is Teresa? - My girlfriend. - What happens? - Some change you made. Ah, it?s better with the loose hair. Don?t you like it? No, no, you?re looking great. You surprised me, that?s all. - You didn?t tell me you had a girlfriend. - She just hunged up on me. - She?s a bit stubborn sometimes. - I already feel much better. Thank to you. Then it might be better that we leave as soon as possible. I?m getting into a mess. Oh, the commitments... Why does everyone make their lives so complicated? - Teresa is going to kill me. - What are you searching for? Loose change. I have to call again. - I hate these misunderstandings. - I have some. Calm down, Alberto, you call her later. How do you know my...? Come, sit. It?s hot! - What are you thinking about? - Nothing. - Come on, what were you thinking? - Nothing. - You can tell me. - What? But I really didn?t think of anything. It?s not true. One is always thinking about something. You were thinking about your girlfriend, right? - You would like to be with her now. - No, it?s not that. You are worried that she?s got it wrong. And it?s all my fault. It?s no one?s fault. But you?re not feeling well. You are mad at me because I?ve persuaded you to come. Look, no one has persuaded me to come and I am not angry. - You aren?t angry? - Not at all. - What is it then? - What do you mean? You might look at it as a stupidity, it?s only that? You seem different. - Different? - Yes... You?re not as nice as you were a while ago. You were so happy in the car, and now? You are so serious ... Yeah. Come on, tell me a joke. - Leave it be. - Come on! One you know. I don?t know how to tell jokes. Liar! You?re just embarassed. Come on, tell me one! No. Also, I don?t recall one right now. Looks like you?re being stubborn now, huh? Can't you see im doing it for your own good? You have to cheer up, Alberto. Cheer up! You know what? You should sell encyclopedias. You have a lot of tenacity. Well, then I?ll tell to you one. Let?s see... Who has... placed the... Mozart Cd into... the cookies box? Laughter is heard further away than crying. It just came into my head. It?s a Jewish proverb. Very clever. Yes... - But do you think that it speaks the truth? - What speaks the truth? - The proverb. - Ah, no. - I think not... - I do not know. I think the punishment always outweighs the joys. We tend to remember the past with nostalgia, but... I think in comparison... there are more moments of suffering than of happiness. Maybe... happiness does not exist. - Well... - Well. - Is your job interesting? - No. Do you sell many encyclopedias? No. Hello, Alberto! I'm very tired. - Hello, Alberto! Hello, Alberto! - Hello. Hello, Alberto! Do you sell many encyclopedias? You have already asked me that question. I just wanted to test you. You seemed so passive, as if you werent listening. Of course I?m listening. - How much do you charge for a encyclopedia? - It depends. Could you make me a good offer? - Are you interested? - You wretch! Looks like you?ve woken up again, huh? Yes. I really like books. I have a lot at home, at least 200. You don?t say! Seriously. The only thing I?m missing is a good encyclopedia. Convince me that your offer is the best. My offer is the best. Okay. Where do I have to sign? - Seriously! - Hey, you don?t have to hurry. - Take your time. - No, really, that's the way I am! You wouldn?t believe the things I?ve done without thinking twice. - I see. - Besides, I trust you. Well...Thins is iI dont have the necessary papers right here. Do you make home visits? - Sure. But first I have to... - Great! I?ll give you my phone number and my address. I?m usually at home in the evening. Perfect. I?ll come around some day. You better do that before I can change my mind. Don?t worry. Hey... you could give me your number in case something unexpected comes up. No, no, I?ll call you! - But... what if you lose my address? - Calm down. - Give me at least the number of your office. - It?s not necessary. Really. Well... So you have my phone number but I don't have yours. It seems to me that I?m putting myself more into this than you. - On what? - You aren?t cooperative, Alberto. Hey... I really don?t know what you are talking about! Don?t you like me? Have I done something wrong? - Not at all. - What then? - What do you mean? - Will you give me an answer? I?m sorry. I think I lost myself. Weren?t we talking about encyclopedias? Don?t play the confused one. You know perfectly well what I mean. - I?m waiting, Alberto. - See... Thank you for being so kind. You?ve been very nice to me. What can I say? - Do you like me? - Sure. - In what sense? - In... the general... - Specific. - I don?t know... I don?t know you that well. - Then why did you say you like me? - I didn?t say that, you said that. - So you do not like me. - No, no ... I mean, yes! It's getting late. - Do you want us to leave? - I think that would be the best. You can come to my place. What?! We could chat, I show you my books and make you a hot chocolate ... No, no, no. Hey, really. I want to go home. Where is the difference between your place and mine? - But I have to sleep. - Hey, in my house there are beds, too... - You?re kidding. - I?m very serious. I swear nothing like this happend to me with any woman. - I?m not any woman. - You can be sure about that. - Do you come? Yes or yes? - I can?t. Teresa is expecting me. Call her and tell her that tonight you?re sleeping over, she?ll understand. She?ll understand... You don?t know Teresa. You know what I think? I think, Teresa is not your girlfriend. You only said that to impress me. To impress you? So... who is she then? - She could be your sister. - The things you say! Besides, even if she?s your girlfriend, I?m not proposing anything dishonest to you. If you're going to reject my offer coherently, you?ll have to find a better excuse. Coherently? Excuse? But why should I have to find an excuse? You?re starting to make me really nervous. Why do you want to go to your home now? Don?t you ever accept a damn refusal? No one in their right mind invites a stranger home at one a.m. to show him her 200 books. Who do you think I am? You can?t just decide on my own life. Damn! There?s no need to talk to me in that tone. - Do you think I?m crazy? - I just want to go home. My home, I want to go home. Don?t you have anything else to say? Listen! If you don?t want to give me a ride, I can take a cab. Do you feel sorry for me? Not at all. Do I disgust you? No, no! Then...I don?t know why you treat me that way. I don?t know why... 210 00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,109 Wait. Sit down! Let?s do something. Today we leave the weird stories be and each of us sleeps at home. Tomorrow I?ll give you a call, we meet for a drink and we chat. Do you agree? - You must think I?m crazy. - No. I am very sensitive. Hey, you don?t have to apologize. So, we have an date Call it what you may. - So...when will you call me? - After work, around eight o? clock. - I do not know... - Okay... a little earlier. I don?t know whether to accept. - What?! - I accept if you ask me politely. - You are incredible. - I know. - Please. - Please, what? Will you go on a date with me, please? Yes. But I do not know if I?ll be home tomorrow. You better give me your number, just in case. Sure. - 5-74-487. - Perfect. That?s strange...only six numbers? - It... lacks a 3. - Where? - At the end. - Don?t you know your own number? It?s...a new number. You know what? I?ve been so lucky to find you on the highway. The bill, please. I think we?re going to be good friends, don?t you think? I?ll wash my face. Give me a line. Be careful with that girl What do you mean? Almost every night she comes here with a different guy. And when she does not come with anyone, she is a pain in the ass. It's worse than the plague! If you say yes to anything, you cannot get her of your back. Each time it gets worse. You know. One of these days she is going to hurt someone. - Stay alert - Don?t worry. Teresa, it?s me again. That's the last time you hung up like that! But what do you want me to do? I'm with a girl that is not right in the head. Me? It?s the first time I?ve seen her! But she insists on treating me as if we knew each other. No way! She had been crying. She even asked me the phone number. No, no, I made one up, of course! I hope to never see her again. Listen. We?ll be leaving now, so I?ll be there in 15 minutes, okay? No, don?t worry, I can take care of myself. I've dealt with people like this before. I have to hang up. Give me a kiss. Goodbye, darling. - What do I owe you? - 300 (peseta, about $2,40) - Can we go? - Whenever you want. - It's on me. - That?s very kind of you. - Bye. - Goodbye, good evening. - Look, the moon is beautiful. - How romantic! You are going to break my heart. Phew... I am so tired! Hush. You?ll be at home soon. Great, huh! Going home. Sweet home. Sure, when you arrive, Teresa will have prepared some dinner. I don't think so, it?s too late for that. And she doesn?t like to cook. I cook very well. I love it. I still don?t understand why you have declined my offer. - We would have enjoyed it. - I think we have discussed this issue enough. That?s true. Besides, we?ll see each other tomorrow. - You will call me, right? - Of course. Well, well. Right now everything seems to go smoothly. - Yes. - I'll confess that I like you very much, Alberto. - You are a very interesting person. - You too. I like you very much. You are... extraordinary. - My god Alberto! Such a compliment. - It?s the truth. You?re an angel. I never thought I could find anyone so nice. It?ll be alright, you?ll see. We speak tomorrow. Sure! We speak tomorrow. - Oops... - What? I think I left your number in the cafeteria. Can you repeat it to me? - I?ve already told you I?m going to call. - Just in case, Alberto. Just in case. Tell me, I have a good memory. It's ... 754-88-62. I mean 3. - Did I say something funny? - Not one... - What do you mean? - You haven?t got a single number right! 574487, oh yes, and a 3. Hey, I?m really sorry. Don?t worry. It?s not the first time. I guess I?m just too naive and will always be fooled. I?ll always have hope to find someone honest. But you are all the same. You are all just... bastards. - Okay, I didn?t trust you, that?s all. - But what have I done to you? Am I not likeable to you? Have I done something wrong? - No, no. - I only wanted to help. But i didn't know you at all. Neither do I know anything about you but I picked you up without thinking twice. I?ve given everything I have. I even invited you to a coffee and to my house! Why did you laugh at me? I didn?t laugh at you. - I am going to call you. - Stop lying! You are driving me crazy! I heard your conversation with Teresa. So you do not want to see me again? You think I?m an unhappy crazy bitch? I never said that. But that?s what you think! You think it, think it, think it! - That?s not what I think. - Shut up! Don?t try to fix it! You can forget me for all I care, you hear me? Forget me! I ignore you! I ignore you! Very well. - We act like an old couple. - This is absurd. Poor Alberto. Do you think you?ve solved everything? How romantic! You love Teresa and Teresa loves you. And screw everyone else, right? One of these days Teresa might run away with someone else. Or die in an accident. And that day you will have to deal with loneliness. - Look at me when I speak! - Enough! You hear me? Enough! Enough! Don?t try to avoid your responsibility! I am not responsible for anything, dammit! I don't owe you because I didn?t request anything. Neither did I ask you to invite me, buy the encyclopedia or show me your books... ...or tell me about your life. I do not even owe you an explanation! - You are very cruel, Alberto. - Do not call me by my name! You didn?t even ask my name! Because I don't care. You know nothing about me and I?m not your friend. I?m not your friend! Then we are enemies. Hey, hey, hey! Why did you stray from the track? where are we going? Okay, this has gone too far. Leave me here! Stop the car! Do you think this is a cab, you idiot? I?m making the decisions now. I?m sick of behaving well. I?m tired of being treated like an animal. Do you understand? Stop the car! Did you think I was going to make this easy for you, you son of a bitch? You understand now, huh? You don?t know who you?re dealing with. I think you should calm down. Let?s talk quietly. Oh, How educated you are now! How diplomatic! See how little help i need to have your attention? See how i can join your life to mine? Do you think these bullets are blanks, asshole? Alberto! You can not escape! I will stay here until you bleed to death. You'd better leave. I'm willing to talk, you hear? Come here. We need to talk. Or do you want to run? Alberto, I?m sorry. I didn?t want to do it! I don?t know why i shot. Please come out, we are civilized people. I swear it will not happen again. Okay. If you do not believe me, look what I do with the gun! Alberto! What have I done wrong? What have I done wrong? Alberto, please forgive me. I'm going to show that it is useless to hide. You see? These are the keys to the car. I can?t abandon you anymore. We will never go away from here! Hello, are you going up to the river? I'll give you a ride if you ask me politely. Subtitles by Dialectica
