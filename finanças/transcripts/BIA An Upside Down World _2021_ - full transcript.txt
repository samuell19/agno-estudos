[sighs] [guitar strums] [laughs] Sometimes I wonder how things would be like if everything was different... What do you mean? I don't know. Imagine how funny the world could be if it were upside down. What? Upside down? [rock music plays] I know you're looking at me And I seem like lightning when I pass by I'm not scared of anything I leave marks and footprints when I go around Everything feels good to me I'm fire and security I know where I wanna go No one else will tell me where Woah! I'm lights and action I'm guilty of it Your best song I'm not gonna stop, I'm not gonna stop I was born to shine! I'm not gonna wait, I'm not gonna wait I'm going for it all and I want more And I move in this game I'm close to winning And I smile It's fun Everything returns to its place to start all over again To start all over again Ooh! I play life, I give it my all It's the way I am Oh! I'm gonna try it I'm not going to lose control of life Singing endlessly The rhythm moves my feet Dancing without stopping Every moment is an A+ Where I'm going I bring sunshine along And all of you too! ALL: I'm not gonna stop, I'm not gonna stop I was born to shine! I'm not gonna wait, I'm not gonna wait I'm going for it all and I want more And I move in this game I'm close to winning And I smile It's fun Everything returns to its place to start all over again To start all over again Maravilhosa. Should I go? Lemme see. CHIARA: Bia! Golden? - No. - No. Stop. - BIA: More... - This with jeans? - Bia. Bia. Bia. - BIA: There... - [clears throat] - Horrible. - BIA: Stop. - I'll put music on. - Stop. More. - More? Stop. [Gritarle al mundo plays on the radio ] [song cuts off] That song is horrible. Totally. It makes me want to scream from disgust. [sighs] Yeah. Aren't you curious about what Pixie is gonna tell us? Surely it's something very big. I'm sure, I have a fifth sense. - That'd be the sixth, Celes! - I also have a sixth sense. I have two. Chiara, can you check my cell phone? Thanks! Sure. BIA: Let's see. I like it. Ah, it's your fans! They loved your new song... They love you... You're wonderful... Tell me something I don't know. Chiara! Tell her something she doesn't know! I can't believe it! The Puma of Love is in town! How could he use that nickname? With that face, he can use any nickname he wants. Look! He's about to go live! Oh, let's go! What's up, Pumates? Y'know what? You're in luck! 'Cos you'll be seein' me lots over the coming days. And I'll answer all of your questions. Well, almost all of them. Love you all. [kiss] [growls] Your next hunt, Puma? [laughs] Have the people from Laix arrived? MARA & CARMÍN: Mmm, no. Does anyone know when they're coming? Also no. [laughs] - Jinx! [squeals] - Augh. [stutters] Is Pixie really going to make a very important announcement? Relax, guys. We're a family. No one in the world's gonna destroy this beautiful thing we got going Tell me if anything interesting happens. I'm feeling some déjà vu. And I'm feel that feeling too much exhausts me, but I can't blame myself, it's who I am. I'm like an exposed heart walking on life's tightrope, right? Did you get anything he said? No idea, let's switch places! I can't bear anyone extra with no sense of humor - Where's Pixie? - Dunno, she should be here now. Yeah. Pixie! - So nice of you to come. It's a pleasure. - [laughing] Of course. I came to talk to all of you before making the official announcement. As of today, Laix and Fundom are merging. Merging? Whar does she mean? - You didn't know? - PIXIE: As you heard. - You knew about this? - PIXIE: This merge means the birth of the most powerful network of the continent... Laixdom! Come on! This is the news of the year! Cheer up! And we're going to celebrate it with a big party. A concert streamed live for the entire world. The concert will feature world-class talent. PIXIE: Isn't this great? [laughs] [growling] Manuel, dear! Thanks for coming. Oh, call me Puma. That hot mess isn't gonna open, right? Of course not. You're gonna do it. The opening act will be done by... - Let's see... - [clears throat] Moondust! [pants] [snarls] [applause] Calm down. Everything's okay. Moondust? [no sound] Calm down. Everything's okay. HELENA: Hello everyone! Hello! Hello! Hello everyone! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! [gasps] Hi, my little sister! What? Don't you recognize me? [laughs] Unfortunately, I do. You can't be here. I can be wherever I want. Maninha. I take control And I'm just getting started Over and out Think about what ticks you off HELENA: Find another song You'll be left stunned here You're an imitation That honestly bores me There are those that look too hard There are those that talk sideways Tchau, goodbye Diz na cara, que é melhor! There are those that look down There are those that watch what they say Tchau, goodbye Diz na cara, que é melhor! BIA & HELENA: In your face, I say In your face, I laugh Look at me I'll tell you what you really are In your face, I see there's fear in your face Look at me You'll find what you want I change something And you're already imitating it I feel and see There's nothing I expect from you Find another song You're not needed here Get to it One girl's enough There are those that look too hard There are those that talk sideways Tchau, goodbye Diz na cara, que é melhor! There are those that look down There are those that watch what they say Tchau, goodbye Diz na cara, que é melhor! In your face, I say In your face, I laugh Look at me I'll tell you what you really are In your face, I see there's fear in your face Look at me You'll find what you want [yelling] MARA: [laughs] Mmm. Here you go. Thanks. [laughs] I love seeing how you do things together. Aw! And we love being here at the Golden residence! It gives off a warm feeling. CARMÍN: Hey, what did you do with your nails today? - Nothing! - Let's see, Mara! - Hmm! I'm not taking it off! - [laughs] So, I did a nailart tutorial, but it doesn't show well. CARMÍN: Hmm, no. They're so boring, to be honest. The most boring are the fashion ones. The ones that are like: "Your look is so cute! It has that touch! Bye bye, cookiecuties!" So fake. And what's up with you? Are you okay? I don't know. I think I'm worried about the Laix and Fundom merge. Because? Well... I'd like to keep on making content without having to worry for that horrible thing of... Looking for fame at all costs. Hmm, okay, well, don't worry. Everything is alright and it'll all go well. Come on. Where's that smile? MARA: [laughs] Come on! Smile! Aww, you look so much better smiling! MARCOS: What would I do without my best friends? MARA: Hmm, nothing [laughs] CARMÍN: No! Getting Bia and Helena together, the mortal archenemies in one space... This is gonna explode. Pixie really went mad. And that's on top of contaminating the good energy we have at Fundom. MARA: Mmm-hmm. This party is gonna cause big problems. Congratulations. There's something magical between you two. And it's much more than music. You have something different... I'm looking for the exact word. BOTH: Chemistry! How did you get that chemestry? - Eh... - Don't know. It comes to us easy, right? We look at each other and we know what the other is gonna do. Like when she's about to sing the wrong note, for example. I love couples with a sense of humor. You don't even know! I can't stop laughing with him. Hmm, that's having... BOTH: Chemistry. They are Moondust. Not only are they able to make the biggest hits, but they're also the perfect couple. Follow me on So Trish! [cell phone rings] Thanks! - Thanks, Trish. Ready? - Mmm-hmm. TRISH: Ah, hits. - Hello? - TRISH: Hits. Yes, that's me. Of course! Be right there! Who was it? Someone who is going to change our lives. You sure love secrets, huh? Hmm. I love them! [sighs] What do you need? To open for the event! Putting Moondust on is ridiculous! I'm sorry, it can't be you. What do you mean not? Do I have to remind you that I'm the fave on socials? For my dancing, my friendliness, and because I am who I am! And all that junk my followers say. Okay, give me a solid argument. Why should I give you the opening act? Hmm? Because I'm your boyfriend, my love. What? I need more than that! - No, no, Pixie... - [Pixie sighs] I don't know if my fragile artist heart could handle not opening. Do you hear my heartbeat? It's delicate, but intense. - Like a hummingbird. - [sighs] You'll have your place. I told you! Well, I think that you'd have to reconsider. [growling] Imagine what could happen if the Puma opens the show.. You can't imagine, right? Me neither. It's unimaginable. - [growls] - Ugh, enough! Yes, yes, enough! How about something new instead? I'd give the opening a breath of fresh air. Although it won't be hot, ya know. [laughs] Alright... alright... let me guess. You, too, want to ask to open the show? [laughing] We wanna ask something better! To document it! Yeah, we wanna record everything. We wanna show backstage! The funny moments! - MARA: Yeah! - CARMÍN: All of it! You're the first people all day to not ask me to open the show. It really makes me wanna give the opening act to you. Hmm. But I won't. [blows air] I'm not a girl like any other Mmm-mmm. Because there's something that makes me special My reign is starting I have no doubts, I'm going to consegrate myself They're always talking about me I want it, I get it It's not a whim... no! You know this is me Successful and alive, all day long Welcome to my business world Don't try and scare me You'll fail You can't stop You can't halt Laixdom The most incredible part is about to arrive You'll see Hi, dad. Hi, princess! Did my gifts arrive? Ah... Yeah, here they are. I bought them in Milan. Well... Tehnically, my assistant bought them, but same thing. Open them. What is this? [laughs] Did the guitar shrink in the wash? Horrible. Sorry, dad, but I'm not in the mood for gifts. I don't want anything today. Tell me what you want. I'll buy it for you. Well... I do want something. The show's opening act. Can that be bought? [sighs] There's gonna be a very important event and the opening act should be for Bia. Yes, of course. But they gave it to your other daughter. The witch! You know you're my little girl. Helena, besides being my sister, is my enemy. Always stealing everything from me, dad! She's like your mother, competitive. - Maybe my other gift can help you. - Which one? It has to be over there, in a little music box that I got you in Switzerland. Here. A coin? Yeah, it's the one you and Helena used to play with when you were little. Remember? You'd make every decision with that coin. And why would I want this? I saved it all these years because it's brought me luck in business. It never fails. You'll see, it'll land on B. - Alright, let's see. - Okay. - Ready, set... - Mmm-hmm. It's so gonna land on... It looks like it failed this time. I'm sure that you're going to open the show. I got to go, we'll talk next week, kay? [kiss] Ciao, princess. Bye, bye. No, it doesn't work. I need to go shopping! - Ah... - My purse! - Okay! Your purse! - Now? We going now? Let's go. Quickly, quickly, quickly. Here, here, here! And how'd things go with Victor? As usual. Mmm, so bad, then. [laughs] What you two had was love at first sight, but you should've given him another look. Don't start, mom. Who needs to look at a boy when the magic is right here? Look at it! Lovely! - You're in love with it, right? - Of course. Whoever said money can't buy happiness doesn't know how to shop. [laughs] You're the best. - Tell me something new, mom. - Seriously. I'm proud of you. They picked you to open the show because you're... Maravilhosa. But most of all because you do what's needed to be number one. Ah, I'm happy, what do I know? But the best part was seeing Bia's face. [laughs] She was furious. She's just like her father. Competitive. Ugh, what a sloth! She's lost the battle with me. No, not battle... War. She envies me so much. [chuckles] She has to go to therapy, eh? [whistles] Therapy, what nonsense. - Just don't fight with her. - I know, ma, we're sisters. [mocking gibberish] No! Because anger brings out wrinkles. [both laugh] - Hi, son. - Hello. My radar detects that something's going on. No, it's nothing. Come on, Alex. You know the one rule we have in this house. - No secrets. - Exactly. Well, tell me. We found out that Fundom is going to merge with Laix and from now on, all of us can spend more time together. And "all of us" means... there's a special girl? Dad! [laughs] Buy 5,000 shares right now. No, how about 10,000. [snaps fingers] Perfect! Good work, guys. Ciao, ciao, see you tomorrow. - Hi, my loves. - Hi, mom. [sighs] Today is a great day. [laughs] Every day is great for you. Because I have you two. [laughs] Our son is in love. - Really? - ALEX: Mmm-hmm. Who stole your heart, son? [sighs] Bia. Bia? Helena's sister? Mmm-hmm. I love that girl! [laughs] - And her family, too. - Yeah! She's a good person! We could have a family dinner with all the Urquizas, what do you think? - Sounds perfect - Aww, yeah! [laughs] ANTONIO: Mmm. You get your turn at love soon. But don't get your hopes up because Bia doesn't even know I exist. She's on another level. Oh, I forgot to tell you! - What? - Manuel came to visit. (gasps) What joy! We haven't seen him in so long! Your brother is a puma at love. You'll be able to ask for advice to win over Bia. - There you go. Hmm? - Hmm? Look at who couldn't resist. Did you know I was here and came to see me? No. It was me who summoned you two here. BOTH: For what? I want you to promote the party. Both of you. Together. [laughing] - Me with her? - Mmm-hmm. I don't know, honestly. I'm gonna have to think about it. I've thought about it. I accept. Do I gotta do the promotion just so Moondust opens? No. No? [laughs] You are going to do what I tell you, dear. Unless you wanna get kicked out of the event. Understood? Perfect. [sighs] Looks like you have no other option. - Don't get me wrong, I get you. - [laughs] - You should open for it. - Yeah. - With me. - [laughs] With you? The Puma of Love with his Brazilian panther. [groans] You couldn't be more of a caveman. Eh... that's how us pumas are. We love to hunt. [growls] When are we gonna start preparing to promo, panther? In your dreams, gatinho. Things between us will be purely professional. [meows] Ya sure 'bout that? [growls] Everyone says I'm a winner I appreciate it because I'm the best I have a surprise prepared for your heart I'm liking what I see Lady luck was on your side today Because your path crossed my destiny And I can see the both of us on that path Stuck together like sweets I don't care what they say about you I'd have to actually like you And from what little I've seen of you I don't think that's happening Simmer down, relax Of course you'll fall in love with me And even though you think of yourself a king You don't have much class Alrighty, then Try a little harder Give me something Something that's real Com'on, now I'm gonna win you over I have something you're gonna like Alrighty, then Com'on, now Alrighty, then Ooh! Com'on, then I've had tons of honeys and made 'em happy But now, love, I want you And people don't usually turn me down I always get what I want I know it looks like I'm talking too much And I know you can't believe everything you've heard But you'll see once you get to know me I'm loving and a gentleman Give a little more effort I'm not like the others ALL: Uh-uh. It's boring hearing you talk About all of your feats What, haven't you noticed? It takes hard work to get to my level Change the script, change the costume And maybe you'll convince me Alrighty, then Try a little harder Give me something Something that's real Com'on, then I'm gonna win you over I have something you're gonna like Alrighty, then Try a little harder Give me something Something that's real Com'on, then I'm gonna win you over I have something you're gonna like - Alrighty, then Ooh! Com'on, then Alrighty, then Ooh! Com'on, then Alrighty, then [applause] [laughs] The amount of buzz the merge is making on the socials is impressive. Everything is going smoothly. There are many comments about the fights between the Laix and Fundom crews. Perfect. PIXIE: Everything works in my favor. Always. Thank you. [clears throat] [clears throat] Can you stop kissing up to the boss for a second? Your devotion to her offends me, Luan. Please. Pixie! Pietro, dear, let him. You know well that I love to be idolized. Hmm. And you, keep it up. "I know what you did." Oh, please! What's this about sending threats with pieces of papers? They ripped this off a thriller movie from the last century. [laughs] A letter made from magazine cutouts. This is psychological terror and it's really disturbing. "T_K_ MO_ND_S_ O_T O_ T_E CONC__T OR EVE__ON_ W___ KNO_ YO__ SECR__." What? Oh, no. Take care of it. Alright. She's really into sweet stuff. - Okay, there they go... The Thiago Juice! - Oh, boy! The healthiest on the market. Try them! - VÍCTOR: Alright! - HELENA: No, thank you. THIAGO: You like the furniture? Excellent! I produce them. Thiago Furniture! [laughs] Thiago Buildings, Thiago Hotels, Thiago Books, Thiago Cooking. I got it all. Everything a person could wish for, but... I'm missing only one thing. Thiago Humbleness™? [laughing] [everyone laughing] I like your sense of humor. "Thiago Humbleness." You're great. But no, [sighs] dear, no. A Thiago Singer... I lack that. I lack a singer that's able to represent my brand the way it deserves. My Thiago Singer will have the best musicians, the best stages, the best production. What you're saying is really good, Thiago, but us two here are a group. Will we be a Thiago Band? Hello? Alana, sweetie! So happy to hear you! And, yeah, of course I wanna see you, you're my favorite stepmother! [laughs] Okay. Okay, I'm on my way there. Sorry, I gotta go. See ya... And think about it. Thiago Singer. Hmm? [chuckles] HELENA: Hmm. We're gonna tell him no. Obviously, Víctor! He completely ignored you! He's looking for a girlfriend, not a group! Well, you can handle that. Right, Helena? Are you seriously saying this to me? [sighs] We've talked about it. Here, the most important thing is to grow Moondust, yeah? Wouldn't you like to tour the world on a Thiago Plane, eh? Aww, didn't get it in. You're so good at basketball. [grunts] PIETRO: "Take Moondust out of the concert or everyone will know your secret"? Who made this letter and what secret are they talking about? LUAN: It could be so many things. Your list is preety long. I was praising, not dragging. I know, I know. I can't, I'm gonna collapse. Would they know mine? Don't even mention it, Pietro. Everyone be more careful. More than ever! If your secret comes to night, it'll be disasterous! Not just for you, but for everyone! I know, Pixie, but I can't do this because I'm an artist. I can only create beauty, I can't deal with the ugly, the harsh, the hostile. Luan, take care of this right now. Please, I need to see the jacuzzi. Could they be talking about ours? Ours? Luan, there's nothing between us. What happened was a mistake. Get it? I don't want you to bring it up again! Besides, Jandino is circling around the building and I don't want him to find out. I'd rather you go find out who sent that letter and what they know. As you wish... My queen. [indistinct] I don't know why it's called Fundom. They should call it Faildom. [laughs] Oh, I don't get it. It looks very colorful to me. But, that's just it. So many colors, so many good vibes that makes me nauseous. Yeah, you're right. - Yeah - How are you, baby? Don't call me "baby." [sighs] Sorry, bebé. I've seen you dance in many videos If you want to, let's get together one day and light the floor on fire! Bye! [snickers] - "On fire." - I hate him so much! The thing is he likes you so much. Well... I wouldn't be interested even if he put on a mask so I wouldn't recognize him. He seems sweet to me. AILLÉN: Hmm? Who did this? No idea, but I don't dislike it, eh? MARA & CARMÍN: It's recent. Pixie also got an anonymous letter. I couldn't help but overhear from behind the door. Anonymous letter? What was it? Ah, a letter without a signature. - [scoffs] - We know what "anonymous" means! Yeah, what did it say, Guillermo? It demanded to kick Moondust off as opening act or, if not, they were gonna reveal her secret. Ugh... No, I don't understand people who are ambitious enough to do anything. No, me neither. If Pixie takes off Moondust, the rest of us have a chance to open. Especially me! [snaps fingers and clicks tongue] Oi... Could Guillermo have sent the letter? Or the vandalizer? - Everyone looks really suspisious. - Hmm. BOTH: We have to discover who it is. I discovered That your friendship makes me happy I only care about getting your heart You and me Always like this Never again Will I be alone on a cloudy day Count on me to smile Mmm, together with you Always like this I wouldn't do anything to hurt you You give me the strength to never give up My good friend and confidant I'll always be present Nothing can Nothing can go wrong You know I'd never backstab you I know well that you really get me I don't care what others see You'll never be my assistant Friends forever to the end [both vocalizing] [laughing] So, you want advice to win over a girl? Mmm-hmm. Well, I can give you all of them. Every technique I've used to make many fall for me... But they won't be of much use to you. Why not? Well, look at you and look at me. You're you, and I'm me. [laughs] There she comes! Sorry, bro, but I saw her first. Look who the cat dragged in. Shall we rehearse? Alex, can you get my me phone? I left it on the terrace. Yes, of course. - Are you ready? - Always. Ooh, you must have gotten that from me. Follow me and I'll make sure that you get nothing wrong. [Bia laughs] Me? How about you don't get anything wrong. This is how it's done. Today, today I'm gonna break free Today, today I'll learn to fly The day shines brighter because Today, today [imitates accent] The best part begins Hey! No, you're so lucky to collab with her. She has such a beautiful voice. Her voice is just full of light. Voice? What voice? Have you seen how hot she is? Come on! Besides, who could fall in love with such a sickeningly sugary voice? Sickeningly sugary? Can you believe what he said? Not me. Bia, your voice is one-of-a-kind! I don't get how Manuel isn't in love with your voice. And I was thinking about shipping you two as Binuel! "Binuel" sounds like a cheesy romance. Besides, who'd use that name when "Manía" is much better? - Manía? - Yeah, Manía. This requires revenge. I know how. Look, Thiago, my priority is to have time for every performance. What's important is the album and tour. Thiago Parfum. - Eh? - Thiago Parfum. I want you to be the face of my new perfume. Vera Di Salvo. And to be the face of Thiago Parfum, you'll become a Thiago Singer, into a Thiago Star! Get what I mean, dear? Yes, but no. Thiago, listen... - What I want is to sing. - And you're gonna sing! Of course you're gonna sing! You're gonna be the Thiago Star. [laughs] With all the power of the Thiago Company® supporting you, you'll sing for me, and you'll sing for the world, Helena, the world! Hmm. And what about Víctor? Hmm... [clacks tongue] I can leave the... decoration by your side. The thing is, you can fly so much higher. Even... You could fly towards my level. There's no more time to wait I see doubt in your look I felt in my chest you're nervous in letting yourself go I want to stay with you Ser mais que um amigo em qualquer idioma Listen to what I'm saying Maybe it's time to perken up My train only passes by once Want the sky? I'll get it for you Moon and stars I can give you today You won't regret it I know some people are jealous But come along, don't be scared I promise to make you happy [scats] [plays saxophone] [laughs] Thiago! - Hmm? - You think you can buy me? You don't know me. But I'd like to know you. [sighs] [nervous breathing] [coughing] For a moment, I thought you weren't going to come. Wouldn't be the first time I've been stood up. Nor the second. Excuse me, did I arrive really late? Half an hour. Ready for our date? No. Uh... Yeah. Yeah, I meant yes, sorry. [laughs] Aww, Alex. [laughs] I can't believe it. The truth is... I still don't know how someone like you could look at someone like me. Why not? You're so... I love your... Your watch! Oh, thank you! [laughs] Anyway, girls always notice guys like my brother. He's the Puma of Love. I... Don't even say it. He thinks he's the king of the world. [laughs] Only because he's super cute. A show-off, fascinating, maravilhoso. - [exhales] - Well... Well, looks like you like him a little, right? - No! No, not at all. [laughs] - Ah, no? I like another Gutiérrez. The cutest of them all. Me? Of course. That's not all, I think you should open your own channel. No, no, I'm not an influencer! I am Alex and nothing else. Besides, who'd even follow me? That doesn't make any sense. I would! Really? I can be your first follower. [camera shutters] [motorcycle roars away] Manuel, darling, for party promo that you're gonna do with Bia, I want you to ooze passion to the crowd, got it? Pixie, I'm the Puma of love. Passion is my passion. [laughs] Oh, alright... Well, it looks like you weren't Bia's passion. [laughs] Look. [sighs] My bro. Well, looks like the Brazilian panther wants to play... - Let's play, then. [growls] - [laughs] [laughs] Brazilian panther! [laughs] - Well, so? What do you know? - Hmm? About what? About my dillema? The anonymous letters? - Did you find out anything else? - Hmm. Relax, Pietro. No one knows your secret. - Okay? - I can't handle it! I'm going to cry! I can't because I feel that everyone stares at me. Hmm. Pietro, people aren't staring at you all the time. How are you so sure about this, Pixie? Because I feel like they do! And I love it. But it scares me too, Pixie. Aww, because I am... Adorable. Hmm... Adorable. I'm adorable, right, Pixie? Hmm... Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I'm adorable. No suspisious activity was registered. Aww, could it be because they stopped plotting against Moondust? Or the conspirers discovered we installed hidden cameras. - BOTH: Hello! - Hello. - How are you? - Very happy. I'm floating on cloud nine while romantic music plays in my head. [both laugh] Hmm, he's so handsome. Oh,yeah! Bia is so lucky! Yeah. Although I'd never fight with you over a boy. Me neither, girlfriend! Never! Never! [laughs] Look! - VÍCTOR: What happened? - HELENA: Nothing. Oh, nothing happened? You met up with him again, something must have happened! Many things. I don't remember. What, have you lost your memory now? You can't always be forgetting everything! HELENA: Not everything! I remember very well that I'm a Thiago Star. Yeah, you would remember all that Thiago Garbage! Is he gonna produce our album or not? That's the only thing you care about, right? VÍCTOR: And what's wrong with that? [sighs] What's wrong with that? If that's the case, then we end here! No, alright, alright, alright, We'l... We'll fix things between us later, okay? The album, is he or is he not gonna produce it? Inacreditable! I don't understand why you're mad! Helena! [sighs] It must be so sad faking for the fans. I would never do something like that. Me neither. [Celeste humming] [Chiara sighs] This letter has to be the one to end them all. Yeah, and wouldn't it be better if we put a nickname? Instead of sending anonymous letters? - A nickname? - Yeah, a cute nickname. - Let's see... - I just thought up of "The Cobra." What do you think? Is it cute? - Your ideas are so... - I know! Absurd! Who would use such a ridiculous nickname? I think it's cute. The Cobra! - CHIARA: Pssh... no! - Yeah, it's cute. Hide everything! Someone's coming! They must see nothing, okay? [Chiara clears throat] - Ey! - Daisy! How are you? What's with you two? - Nothing! It's just a little cold. - CELESTE: It's a little hot. A little cold and hot, yes. You are going to tell me what you're hiding right now. - Daisy! - We were cutting out letters for fun. - Or not? - [Daisy sighs] And who told you to cut something out? It was you two, right? You did the grafitti and sent that letter to Pixie. We just wanted to get Bia to open for the show. She doesn't know about this. Don't tell her. Okay. And what do you know about Pixie to blackmail her? Nothing, but ahe has a lot of secrets, maybe it worked. - Yeah, that's it. - Oh, you're so naive, girls! So naive. You're not doing this any more. - CELESTE: We're not... - Got it? - No... we won't do it. - Okay? DAISY: Or I'm telling on you. And Pixie will kick Bia out of the event. - Have I made myself clear? - CELESTE: Okay. - Yeah? - [clears throat] Yes. - Great! - So, you're not gonna say anything about what we did, right? You're not gonna say anything, right? - CHIARA: You're... - What are you gonna do? You'll see! Ciao! Oh, no! Hey! Sorry, if I'm not mistaken, I left my waist bag here earlier. Don't know if... [music plays in the distance] PIETRO: [singing off-key] A song woke me up It gave me back love and strength And I discovered that dreams Will only come if you take risks Don't let anyone tell you that it's all a lost cause No, no, no, no, let's go back. Don't let anyone tell you that it's all a lost cause And let out what you've put away today Don't let anyone shut down the path your life has gone through And let the rhythm take you to your heart Come, come, come, come Dare to dream again and again Come, come, come, come Dare to fly No one's gonna stop us - [Pietro vocalizes] - [laughs] I can't believe it. No one's gonna stop us [vocalizing] No one's gonna stop us! Alex, what's this? It's a little surprise that I prepared for you, my love. Don't get it mixed up. If... you posted something it's because you're sure about us. Us? Hey, look. Over here, over here, be careful. There. Don't worry, just listen. [sighs] [romantic music plays] I never thought that love would find me And it hit like a train Your peachy face Sweet and glistening It's the forbidden fruit And how was I going to imagine That a kiss would reach To go as far as the Milky Way on a flight through space First love The rainbow brought me to your feet Magic butterflies flying on your skin Bia, I love you! [Alex vocalizing] You and me make a heart whole My big love Promise me That we'll come out singing As Bilex You think I haven't noticed, right? What I think is that I'm in a rush, I don't have time. Come on, trying to make me jealous with my little brother is not okay. Not okay at all. And now you're also spying on me? No, I just saw your face when he was chucking little hearts at you. Don't try to fool me. And don't fool yourself either. Puppies like Alex are not made for panthers like you. And what do you think suits a panther like me? A puma can show you what real love is like. [laughs] I don't see any puma. I see a plush gatinho that on top of it all criticizes my singing. So that was it? [laughs] Look, I was just joking, 'kay? Maybe you need a kiss from the Puma - to cure you of your bad sight. - [laughs] You're also an eye doctor? I'm whatever you want. [growling] How about the Inviisble Man? [growls] If it's not to tell me that you have everything ready, don't call me again. Understood? I can't be the only person doing things well around here. [sighs] Hmm. Excuse me. What do you need? Well, I came because I thought of a great idea to turn Laixdom into the best network. You've gotta make room for everybody's creativity. Hmm, exciting. - [laughs] - Thank you! But I came up with this awesome name. Not Fundaix, nor Laixdom... Check it! Be yourself, be you! Be yourself. This has to be the name and the philosophy of the network. [laughing] "Has to be"? Oh, your ridiculous speach is increasingly out of this world. But don't worry, you'll grow out of it. Until then... Scram! Need something, my queen? Were there more threats? No. Maybe that means that they realized I'm not one to give in. Or maybe they're planning something worse, I don't know. Everything will be okay. You know why? Because things always work out for you. You always know how to flatter me the moment I need it the most, right? And I'm also a good kisser. - Oh, yeah? - The best. You remember? No. Not really. I'll refresh your memory, then. The picture I just took of you two came out so beautiful! I knew that if I watched you real closely, I was gonna find something. Delete it, Daisy! No. No way am I deleting it. The whole world is gonna see it. Especially your boyfriend, Jandino. [clacks tongue] What a shame. Or maybe there's no need to do anything. You decide. Oh, now I get it. You're the person who been extorting me. You're the one who sent that letter. The one who did that grafitti. And now this. No, sweetie, that wasn't me. But you have bo idea how much I'm enjoying that look full of fear. Don't call me "sweetie"! You want me to erase the photo? Hmm. Víctor! How are you? How's that little band of yours? Hey, if ya want, some day you can open for one of my shows.= I love to help new small talent. Hmm, thanks... But I don't think being associated with the Affectionate Cat would be good for us. - The Puma of Love. - Ugh, that's even worse! Besides, what we do is professional music. - You're right. - Mmm-hmm. Professional music. [laughs] Professionally boring. If you want. some day I can give you some tip to write songs. The last thing I'd like in life would be to ask you for advice about music. Yeah. - You're a little tense today, huh? - [sighs] I know... It's 'coz of the whole losing opening act thing, right? [laughs] Daisy blackmailed her with something. That's the only explaination I could find. Well, that doesn't matter now. We're closing on a very good deal with Thiago Productions. Sound familiar? He knows how to value a good thing. And why has he called you two? Hmm. He's very interested in Moondust. He's very interested in Helena, really. [laughs] What's important is that he's available to do whatever for her. And that doesn't bother you? In this business... You gotta know to take advantage of every opportunity [sighs] "You've gotta know to take advantage of every opportunity." Of course. BIA: Of course not! MANUEL: Listen, I'm just asking for a minute. BIA: Not even 10 seconds. Panther, with what I'm about to tell you, you'll forgive me for everything. [Bia laughs] Impossible, gatinho. Tchau. Okay. I was gonna tell you how to get back the show's opening act, but... Your loss. [sighing] Wait. Tell me. Now, only if you ask me nicely. Please, Manuel. Oof... I think you can do a little better than that. [deep sigh] Please, my Puma of Love... Could you tell me? Mmm, much better. - I have a secret that will be a doozy. - Let's see. Pietro, Laix's megastar... He doesn't know how to sing. - What? - He's a disaster. It only looks like he sings good 'coz he lipsyncs and they modify his voice. As disasterous as me? You're quite the petty one. No, much worse. He sounds like if a rubbish compactor were inside another rubbish compactor. If what you're saying is true, we can use that information to blackmail Pixie - and get back my spot in the concert. - Mmm-hmm. But before, we'll need proof. We have to set a trap for him! MANUEL: We need some help from Thiago. He'll have to convince Pietro to sing live with some excuse. BIA: While we sabotage his backing audio so that his real voice will come to light. [laughs] We're on the same page, panther. [growls] Now that you've made that clear, how are we gonna get Thiago to help us? For that, we're gonna need the help of your dear sister... Helena. What? [laughs] No, no, no, over my dead body! I ain't asking that unbearable egocentric chick for anything! Look, panther... Either you join forces with your sister... Or you say bye-bye to opening act. You decide. You couldn't have thought of a weirder place for us to meet, eh? Oh, it was the only way to make sure that no one overhears us. We cannot let Daisy beat us. [laughs] The only thing that girl can beat us in is having no rhythm. No one messes with an Urquiza. Great, maninha! So, we agree on this. We both wanna destroy Daisy, alright. But for that, we'll have to join forces. Either we form an aliance or we both lose out. We have no other option. Okay. I accept. But I'll tell you this, eh? This changes nothing. We're not gonna turn into sisters that have each other 'till the end of the world, eh? [laughs] Of course not! I wouldn't even cross a river to be your friend. Enemies forever. Forever. As soon as we kick Daisy off opening act, everything will go back to as it was before. May the best woman win. What's the plan? The Duke of Milfort booked the whole place just for him and his wife. It's their five-year wedding anniversary and she's a very big fan of yours. It's a pleasure to be able to move others with my music. I don't know if I've said already. I love driving 'em to madness. Oh, yeah. Of course. - And if you want, you can sing a cappella! - No! I mean, don't worry. I came prepared. I am at one with my music. Where's the soundboard? Down here. Good, we'll be down in a second. Thanks. Tell me when everything's ready, yeah? [sighs] [sighs] You want to eat something before? We have an excellent international chef. No, thanks. Weird foods don't really fill me. I embrace more the art of simplicity. Gimme a hamburger, a pizza, I'm happy. [music plays] A song woke me up It gave me back love and strength And I discovered that dreams Will only come if you take risks Don't let anyone tell you that it's all a lost cause And let out what you've put away today Don't let anyone shut down the path your life has gone through And let the rhythm take you to your heart Come, come, come, come Dare to dream again and again Come, come, come, come Dare to fly No one's gonna stop us Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh No one's gonna stop us Ah! What are you doing? Oops, sorry! Sorry! Sorry, sorry! Dare to fly [distorted] No one's gonna stop us Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh - [music stops] - [Pietro sings out of tune] [out of tune] No one's gonna stop us - [Pietro vocalizing out of tune] - [laughter] [heart beats] Ooh, sorry! Sorry! I'll help you. The Puma got everything! [laughs] We got the winning letter. [laughs] Does Daisy have everything ready for her number? Yeah, everything's ready. They've discovered Pietro's secret. They're saying to take Daisy off first place at the opening. If not, they'll post everything on social media! But... what? Don't know... I don't know! But they told me they had it recorded with his true voice! Pietro is one of our best stars. This is a disaster. I'm dead tired of all this extortion! - [sighs] - And who's extorting you now? - Us - Hey! [laughs] You two! Of course! Tell me, how'd you discover the Pietro thing? - [Helena laughs] - Oh, that's not important, but... If you don't want us to ruin this, kick Daisy off opening act right now! HELENA: Mmm-hmm. We don't know what she's got on you, but that doesn't matter... Ours is stronger I'd rather sacrifice Jandino and not Pietro, he's part of the business. I love it when you talk like this. What about Jandino? The Jandino stuff doesn't matter. I'm taking Daisy out. This Pietro thing cannot get out. You win. Now, scram! Out of my sight! And decide between you two who gets to open! I give up! [sighs] We won't reach an agreement by talking! We both agree on that! Do we flip a coin like before? [laughs] Really? That? You have a better idea? No. [laughs] I knew it. As usual. Whoever it lands on opens the show. There's no turning back. Luck is on your side. But talent is on mine. - See you on the stage. - [laughs] [laughs] VÍCTOR: I can't believe you took so long to pick a handkerchief! Don't you get they don't have - the same significance? - No, I don't! Yeah, yeah. [crowd clapping] [crowd cheering] [vocalizing] Because I made it here alone And I know no one's ever believed in me En cada paso al avanzar Saying "I'm gonna do it" After so much falling I don't walk on the floor anymore I'll take flight today and live My story, my dream, and passion BIA, CELESTE, & CHIARA: If the world is turned upside down It's because there's nothing normal about me My heart's talking to you, wondering If I'm going after my dreams And I always come Making everything change If we talk about passion Don't get too bothered Come over and I'll show you how I am Today, I'm gonna shine and sing I'm gonna leave it all behind Today, I'm only gonna trust myself I'm gonna do it my way And everyone will hear The power of my voice This is my place and you'll all see That I came to leave it all behind Leave it all behind [Bia, Celeste, and Chiara vocalizing] Leave it all behind [Bia, Celeste, and Chiara vocalizing] If I'm going after my dreams And I always come making everything change If we talk about passion, don't get too bothered Come over and I'll show you how I am Today, I'm gonna shine and sing I'm gonna leave it all behind I'm gonna leave it all behind Today, I'm only gonna trust myself >I'm gonna do it my way And everyone will hear The power of my voice This is my place and you'll all see That I came to leave it all behind [Bia, Celeste, and Chiara vocalizing] [crowd cheering] - [Celeste and Bia laugh] - Can you explain to me what this is? Too late, maninha! - [laughs] - You're a little brat. You would need to cheat me, eh? Want my shoulder to cry on? [laughs] VÍCTOR: What's wrong? - [screams] - Hey! Bia is what's wrong! She tricked me to get to be opening act of the concert! - But who'd care about that right now? - I care! That was my place! Helena, tomorrow, everyone will be talking about Moondust. Okay. You're right. [sighs] As a band, we get each other very well. But when we get off that stage, we [whistles] will be over. You know I'm in the right. But Moondust will go on. Of course! Moondust will go on forever. Let's give it our all, eh? We were born ready, dear! [Thiago clears his throat] [laughs] [crowd cheering] Come closer Come on, it's getting late And there's no more time to waste There's a place I wanna take you to Where anything is possible if you believe Don't make me wait I know the future is now It's today, let's go for it all! Dancing forever Let's take over This universe and the rest of them VÍCTOR & HELENA: I come from afar Only in search of your love And now that I have you I stopped and see Everything way better I come from afar Only in search of your love And now that I have you I stopped and see Everything way better You'll see! It wants to happen It's not too late This time I'll trust that this moment will last forever VÍCTOR & HELENA: I come from afar Only in search of your love And now that I have you I stopped and see Everything way better I come from afar Only in search of your love And now that I have you I stopped and see Everything way better [Víctor & Helena vocalizing] I come from afar Only in search of your love [crowd cheers] - [Manuel laughs] - [sighs] What are you doing here? I came to do my warmup exercises before the show. I like to be prepared. I was just leaving. Why so fast? Relax, this puma doesn't bite. Hey. Told you sooner or later you'd end up in my arms. [sighs] I only tripped. Come on, don't make excuses. I cannot believe this. What's wrong? This is... one of those tacky handkerchiefs that my sister uses! Well, where were we? You were... about to get out of my way. 'Kay. Our paths lead to the same place. The more you try to deny it, we... - are inevitable. - [laugh] In this universe and any other. You think you're irresistable, right? I don't know. You tell me. [laughs] Told you. You and I are destined to be together. The Puma of Love with his Brazilian panther! [laughs] Keep at it, gatinho. This panther has a show to finish. You coming? [growls] [growling] The secret to success, they say is to surround yourself with people better than you. In my case, that wasn't possible. [crowd laughs] But I managed to merge together the web's best talents. Today, Laix and Fundom... unite! - [crowd cheers] - Welcome to the future! Welcome to Laixdom! I wanna break free, I wanna go out In this world, something changed within me I wanna sing, I wanna laugh And I ask myself: Is this how I am? Nothing's gonna stop me now I've got everything to win And that fills me with happiness I see the world is upside down today Like my head's on my feet Nothing matters, anything goes! ALL: I wanna fly, dance endlessly Everything's all good here I feel special I wanna fly, dance endlessly Everything's all good here It's different, it's great A fleeting night of the best kind Music, friends Photos, lots of love I'm gonna say One more time What I think of is what's my reality And if you want to follow me Prepare to laugh This joy grows more and more Let's change together, today I'm gonna define who I am I'm going to enjoy singing right now I wanna fly, dance endlessly Everything's all good here I feel special I wanna fly, dance endlessly Dance endlessly Everything's all good here It's different, it's great I'll keep on singing Singing, dancing Always dancing like this Always dancing like this Singing, dancing Dancing happily forever Happily forever I wanna scream, I wanna keep on Feeling my body revive We can't see the moon anymore But above us, the sun and blue sky instead To me, it doesn't matter If it rains or storms at all I'm still having a good time here I won't stop to think I'm only letting myself go This is perfect, this is ideal [vocalizing] I wanna fly, dance endlessly Everything's all good here I feel special I wanna fly, dance endlessly Everything's all good here It's different, it's great I wanna fly, dance endlessly Everything's all good here I feel special I wanna fly, dance endlessly Everything's all good here It's different and great I'll keep on singing Singing, dancing Dancing like this forever Like this forever I'll keep on singing Dancing happily forever [crowd cheers] You know what?
