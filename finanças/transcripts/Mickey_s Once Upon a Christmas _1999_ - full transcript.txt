To these kids, the only difference between a broken heart and a smile... is you ! You’re on ! Break a leg, pal. Look, I’m really sorry, but I can’t stay. I got some Christmas shopping to do, you know, and, uh-- Gosh. ♪♪ [ "Jingle Bells" ] ♪♪ [ Continues ] ♪♪ [ Continues ] ♪♪ [ Trombone ] ♪♪ [ Clarinet ] ♪♪ [ Dixieland: "Jingle Bells" ] - The band is back ! - [ Fireman ] Must have been a hot one at Crazy Pete’s.

Well, I, um-- I think it’s time for you to open your gift. Oh ! A case-- [ Chuckles ] ...for my harmonica. Oh, my ! A chain for my... watch. Oh, Mickey, it’s beautiful. But I traded my watch to get you that case. And I traded my harmonica to get a chain for your watch. Oh, Mickey ! I can’t believe you gave up what means the most to you... for me. Oh, Minnie. You’re all the music I’ll ever need. [ Meowing, Yawning ] [ Sighs ] Merry Christmas, Mickey. Merry Christmas, Minnie. [ Minnie ] Want some fruitcake ? [ Giggles ] [ Narrator ] A gift from the heart is cherished and true. A present is best... when love’s given too. So, in the end, it’s love that’s the reason... that Christmas is more than a gift-giving season. It’s a time with our loved ones to show that we care, when families and neighbors come together to share. So, this Christmas season, let us all do our parts, to keep Christmas spirit alive in our hearts. ♪ What fun it is To ride and sing A sleighing song tonight ♪ Woof ! ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way ♪ [ Howls ] ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ Hey Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh ♪ [ Chorus ] ♪ One-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ One-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ One-horse open Ah, ah, ah, ah ♪ ♪♪ [ Singing Scales ] ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la la-la, la-la la la ♪ ♪ ’Tis the season to be jolly Fa-la-la la-la, la-la la la ♪ ♪ Don we now our gay apparel Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la la la ♪ ♪ Troll the ancient yuletide carol ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la la la, la-la la la ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la la la La-la la la ♪ [ Guffaws ] ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ [ Together ] ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy New Year ♪ ♪ Good tidings we bring To you and your kin ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy New Year ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a hap-py ♪ ♪ New Year ♪ ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la la la ♪ ♪ Those jingle, jingle bells ♪♪ ♪ Deck the halls ♪ ♪ With boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Deck the halls ♪ ♪ With boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la ♪ ♪ La, la ♪ ♪ ’Tis the season ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ ’Tis the season ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la, la-la-la ♪ ♪ ’Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la, la-la-la ♪ ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la, la-la ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Troll the ancient yuletide carol ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Everybody sing the yuletide carol ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la, la-la-la ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la, la-la-la ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Very merry Christmas ♪ ♪ Very merry Christmas ♪ ♪ See the blazing yule before us ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la, la-la-la ♪ ♪ La-la, la-la, la-la ♪ ♪ Strike the harp and join the chorus, yeah ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Follow us in merry measure ♪ ♪ While I tell of yuletide treasure ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la ♪ ♪ La-la-la ♪ ♪ La, la, la, la ♪ ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ ’Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ Merry, merry Christmas ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Merry, merry Christmas ♪ ♪ La-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Merry, merry Christmas ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Merry, merry Christmas ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Jingle jangle ♪ ♪ Santa’s got a brand-new bag ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Merry, merry Christmas ♪♪
