Tonight a man came to see me with some information On the way here he was badly scared,that came from him Unfortunately I let him get away while I was fetching the drink I must be slipping Ten years ago I would have made him talk before I got him a drink Five years ago I would have locked the door while I went to fetch it Tonight.. Now you are talking nonsense,come along and have another drink That man tonight,the man I let get away He said he lived in Palazzo Boria Do you know where that is? Yes I do.It is on the Grand Canal on the other side of the town Buongiorno Signor Buongiorno.What is this place? This is Galleria Boria.But please go upstairs,and have a look around Everything is for sale Including that staircase? Why not?

He is the outside porter He is taken a day off I understand One day,two, maybe three one never knows with Carlo I can't help being worried, this man could be dangerous He could,wherever you think of There is little of importance that Boldesca could tell him,Signorina Even a little could mean a lot to a private detective If he talks to Bold.. No,no,that can't happen, Boldesca has been sent away Sent away? Where? To Milan.Please don't worry Soon our arrangements will be complete and then you will have no more anxieties I shall be glad when all this is over You think Mercer will come back? I'm sure he will In that case it might be wiser to get him out of the way When he comes back tell him what he wants to know You can do that can't you? -Yes,if you wish me to -I do If we don't help him,he might help himself to too much When a man faces a blank wall he turns round and comes back but him on the wrong path and he will never come back I gave instructions that Boldesca was not to meet the Englishman It was unavoidable,Signore He has been dealt with now Mercer has been here It would have been the police and not Mercer if Boldesca had talked Never the less it wasn't done as I wanted Remember that I took you out of the gutter That I gave you a name, that I put the blade on your sleeves Remember those things, Longo I won't forget ,Signore You want me to deal with this Mercer?

Not more than usual,why? -You are signor Eduardo Mercer? -Yes I should be glad,signore, if you would accompany me to the questura(Police HQ) Signor Spadoni Chief of Police would like to see you What do they want me for at the police headquarters? I am not told that Must be something important to send a sergeant Maybe because you are English,as a compliment First time the police has ever wasted a compliment on me This way,please,signor Mercer Signor Spadoni will see you straight away I do not smoke but if you wish Luigi? Your passport please! How many times have you been in Italy Mr Mercer? Five You obviously like our country I go wherever my work takes me Your work? I am a private detective You do not ask why I sent for you? I am full of curiosity Once a time we can gratify the curiosity at least If you will come with me I've something very interesting to show you Luigi,has Mr Mercer's passport registered and checked Si,signor This body was pulled from the canal near your hotel at six o'clock this morning As you can see this man's face has been battered to it is almost unrecognizable He has been stabbed,there is a wound on the left arm Round the wound was wrapped a handkerchief I have it marked with your name I have satisfied your curiosity. Can you satisfy mine? Some of it This man answered in an advertisement of mine for information about Renzo Uccello You know who he was? He said his name was Sandro Maccanti, last night was the first time I've seen him On the way to meet me,he was beaten up, at my hotel I bandaged his arm with my handkerchief then whilst I was out of the room to get him a drink he disappeared I've got nothing from him about Uccello Probably he gave you a false name I think he did What are you going to do? Arrest me for his murder No.I have more interest in Uccello Luigi,seek up Mr Mercer's passport please -It has been thoroughly checked -Good About this Uccello Who wants him? A Paris firm of lawyers. They have an american client,whose son, a flyer,was shot down in Italy during the war Renzo Uccello who was a partisan saved his life He carried him over the mountains through the snow,then he left him at an inn where he lay sick,later the germans came along and raided the place and the son was taken prisoner Do you believe this story? Why not? Flyers were shot down and rescued Besides I found the inn They remembered Ucello there told me that he'd originally come from Venice That's why I came here And then when you find him what happens? He's a hero.A lucky one. There is a reward for him He did save a man's life This one we pulled him out of the canal, much too late to save his life was said to knew something about this Uccello Don't you find this very interesting? My only interest is to find Uccello -Your passport Mr Mercer -Thanks I'm sorry I couldn't help you Very good of you to come -Good Bye -Good Bye Luigi Get this done I don't trust him Did he do it? I don't think so Oh,Cassana I got a job for you At your service,Signore Stop your fooling,I want to work someone A woman,yes? No,a man Who is he? Edward Mercer,English staying at the Albergo Adriatico Is that all? No,it is not all Luigi.You remember the big political killing we worked around together during the war? Yes of course,we got the man Of course,we caught the man,he was shot but you remember too, we both felt though we could not get enough definite proof that there was others behind him, two others,one Edward Mercer, a British agent,and Rosa Melitus,an English woman who has lived in Italy for about 20 years And what do we find now in Venice The same Edward Mercer looking for a man who disappeared during the war a man I know to be guilty of robbery treason and murder and also in Venice Rosa Melitus running a sort of boarding house A nice couple and already a man has been killed You had better keep an eye on him,Cassana Why don't you pull out of the whole thing A job is a job,specially in these days What about this girl,this Adriana? What about her? Perhaps I could make some inquiries about her for you No,I don't think so All right.Perhaps you'd better That'll be Bernardo Who is he? Bernardo,he is an undertaker -Rosa,come here! -Bernardo,my beautiful -Who is this? -Edward Mercer,I told you about him How long have you been here in the house? About 20 minutes You're here on business or.. Business.Why? The police is very interested in somebody in this house It isn't Rosa,unless she is hiding something from me Cannot be me because me they would treat different How do you know? Look By the canal I know them all,the long is a street photographer,his name is Cassana Cassana? I've seen him before Thanks for the tip Bernardo is a good man to know if ever you are in trouble I've seldom been out of it It's true for all of us.There is only one place where men are free of problems I make my money putting them there -Buon Giorno -Buon Giorno Great man this Nerva Politicians.There is a great man. Everybody in Italy likes him He is coming tomorrow I see He is going to open an art exhibition, it is going to be a civic reception Procession of gondoliers on the Grand Canal Fireworks in the evening of course Yes.Of course Hey Signore All right I'll do it He is a nice little fellow What's his name? -ToTo -ToTo,It's a nice name. What's yours? Ninetta.Ninetta Maria Minelli That's a nice one too.Much much longer Carlo Boldesca lives with you,doesn't he? Yes.I saw Massimo kick ToTo Poor ToTo Have you ever seen a friend of his called Renzo Uccello? Uccello? Ninetta -Good Evening -Good Evening Run along,darling,your father wants you Then you better run along -Good Night -Good Night I was coming to see if Boldesca was back I'm afraid he is not That's a pity.I was still looking for his friend Renzo Uccello That's a pretty heavy bag may I take it with you? Thank you It is heavy.What is it you are hiding in here? Antiques? No.Onions and tomatoes Do you have far to go with this? Quite a way May I come with you? That's very kind of you I got a job once delivering vegetables I was twelve and I wanted the money for a bicycle And did you get it? I am glad I came to the Palace this evening,I might have missed this Is it important for you to know about Boldesca? Yes it is.I came to Italy to trace a man called Renzo Uccello And Boldesca was going to give me some information about him -May I have a cigarette? -Yes I'm sorry I think I can tell you all about you want to know about Uccello You can? Yes But yesterday you said I know but Uccello isn't someone I find it easy to talk about to a stranger Now that I know you a little it's less difficult If you could help me at all I'd be very grateful Uccello was here during the last part of the war We were together I only want to know where he is now I'm sorry to have to do this He is dead He was killed in air raid in a small town called Mirave It's not very far from here If you go there ,they will tell you all about it Had he any relatives? Not that I know of I'm the only one who remembers him I should have told you in the past No,you helped me a lot I'm very grateful I'm glad I shall have to go to Mirave And after that will you be leaving Venice? I don't know Here we are 1130 pm 3rd January 1945 This place was in German hands then Killed everyone in the hotel Is there another hotel? Si,si,signor,out here Hotel Risorgimento across the square there Signor,no good at looking. Nothing but a pile of rubble now 18 killed And Uccello was one of them? That was it says here How would Uccello be identified? I don't know,you'd better ask Grespi He was Mayor at the time, he was first on the spot Pulled most of them out and arranged the whole lot for funeral Must have made a fortune out of the business Where do I find him? You'll find him Sino bandi Grespi by the station, he is an outstanding mason,he did a memorial plaque out of it -Thank you very much -Grazie -Buena sera -Prego signor Scuza,Signora It is not a polite to enter without being requested Now what has happened You have just interviewed Signor Mercer I want to know all that was said All.Word for word Everything But put your shoes on first Are you the man that carved the memorial in the square? It's a fine piece of work Mamma mia,no Who did then? My assistant Paolo Cervo.A genius you see,if there ever was one Poor Paolo,the Germans took him when they left Only the Good Lord knows what has happened to him He's dead I suppose.If you come inside I'll show you some of his work I'd like to I believe you helped the people here on the night of the air raid Yes I was Mayor then,what a night that was Do you remember a man named Renzo Uccello? Who was one of the killed Yes.Very well I and Paolo carried him out Look at this panel,Signor There is a donkey for you with a broken back and belly full of sour hay Only a genius could have done that What was this man Renzo Uccello like? He was smashed to pieces,they all were I'll show you some of Paolo's designs Then how did you identify him as Renzo Uccello? He had his identity card and a letter from a woman in Venice Who is she? I don't remember.We wrote to her. She send some money for his funeral Now that's like for every colour When were the identity cards and the other records being held Oh,burnt,when the English soldiers took over the town hall they used it for their cookhouse fires Now see how he handles that design, there is life to it,yes and birds and children Paolo he was a fine engaged painter Did Paolo Cervo do that? I'd like to have a page of it. I'll pay you for it Never mind about the paint but take it,take it It's good to know somebody else appreciate Paolo Infinitely much Very fine piece of work my dear.Very fine I must congratulate you Thank you.But I'm glad it is finished We had some trouble with the blueish stance Have you a buyer for it? Yes.A silk merchant from Milan as fat and ugly as one of his own worms It should go to a palace of a Cardinal However,the world changes I saw the Englishman Yes He went to Mirave yesterday You don't see to be very happy about it I wish all this could be over It's been so long.Always lying and the deceit Sometimes I think I just,I just can't go on any longer Cara Signorina I understand,you mustn't worry about it,everything will be all right Our only danger was the Englishman And now he has been put off I am glad my man was able to find you Well we both take it easy for you I have joined the ranks of the unemployed Where did you found Renzo Uccello? He's dead A hero's death I hope I suppose you telling me Here is his dossier,come, please have a look at it Have a good look at it Incidentally it was not your photographer spy who followed me to Mirave but somebody did A woman.If he was known to be buried in Mirave we would have told you He has done just about everything isn't he? Now you understand why I was a little suspicious when you came around making inquiries about him A murderer,a thief,forgery,the life Why didn't you get your hands on him? Don't ask embarrassing questions No,no because he was no ordinary crook, half french half serb,not really Italian And he seemed to inspire a certain loyalty in the people he worked with Well at any rate they never betrayed him It is going to be easier to tell our american clients the truth Decent people are entitled to few illusions Go by then and tell your friends that Uccello died like a hero I don't like it,I don't like it at all You think Renzo Uccello did this design as calling himself Paolo Cervo Yes The police records say that Uccello was once an apprentice to a stonemason Paolo was a stonemason,Uccello was a draftsman,an artist,so was Paolo I think that Uccello used the name Paolo Cervo as an alibi And that he parted his Uccello papers on a smashed up body When that body was buried all proof that Uccello was still alive disappeared I am going to have a look at that tapestry in the Boria Palace If the two designs are the same means to say that Uccello was not the man buried at Mirave It's no concern of yours,for your money Uccello is dead I don't like to be fooled -By a woman -By anyone What did Bernardo find out about her? Nothing that helps There is something going on in that palace Boldesca came from there to tell me about Uccello and he was murdered Now Paolo design turns up there You don't want to finish up like Boldesca did I can take care of myself The times I have heard men say that Take it Thanks I never use them Survival is often the simple method being able to change your habits at the right moment You watch yourself in that palace Ninetta what are you doing here? I was strolling up,papa,I couldn't sleep But you know that the signor Conte doesn't give you permission to play in this part of the gallery Do you want me to lose my job? -I was only playing.. -Go down at once Look at your new night dress, you catch a death of cold I wish I didn't have to go to bed, I'm sure I'd woke late What is Uccello doing here? One might ask the same question about you Come in and shut the door And they told you who does it.. No I do not know who it would be I just got a message to say that you'll be at Orfeo at Saturday about eight o'clock You are to meet him there, I must confirm it btw -Eight o'clock Orfeo's glass works -Right Then help yourself with some sherry and stop fawning What is he doing here? Why shouldn't I come up here? As soon as I'm finished with Amadeo Nerva I'll be away Every artist likes to see his work, while it is finished All I need is a few minutes Did Adriana tell you it was finished? Well,Signore, she tells me everything I hope you don't tell her everything She must not know about Amadeo Nerva Who do you think I am? That's enough I don't want to hear the name of Nerva You could have five minutes Good Evening Contessa, what shall we do this evening? Play a game,dance or sing The Contessa would like to dance,very well Who are you? I'm Count Boria.Please don't get that on my cushions My name is Mercer,Minelli there knows me Quite But that doesn't explain your presence here Let him give his explanations to the police He can explain to them as well as necessary I came in here late this afternoon to have a look around I sat in a window seat and I must have fallen asleep When I woke up it was dark,there was a light coming from underneath the door I went across,as I got there someone came out I couldn't see who it was,but he behaved very suspiciously A ridiculous story Go on Mr Mercer I thought it was a burglar, we played cat and mouse in there for a while and then Ninetta came in I didn't want to frighten her but as I was going across to the light something hit me One can get very odd feelings in that room at night Imagination Well is cuts not imagination This is what hit you,Mr Mercer I don't believe the story, he should be searched I didn't take anything,you can look in my pockets And I didn't knock myself out You can send for the police if you want to I don't think that would be necessary Minelli take the child down to your quarters I have had reasons before to complain about her wanderings And make a search of the premises with Mr Longo Si,signore Conte Perhaps we ought to take a look around the tapestry room If you wish.Please We won't find anybody You see there is nobody here So I see I think you will let me give you a drink Thanks I could do with one Come on I see Very well Minelli Minelli has been through the palace,there is no one here who should not be Maybe I dreamed it all Maybe You are feeling all right now? Yes thank you I'll let you out through my parade entrance It used to be a secret exit I use it to save Minelli trouble with the main door at night time That is a very interesting tapestry you have in the work room Who did the design? You like it? Very interesting Signorina Medova,who works here did it It's based on a painting by Roland Savori, which as far as I can remember used to be in the Kunst Historiches Museum in Vienna -Good Night Mr Mercer -Good night Signorina Medova? -It's open -Grazie Good Evening I'd like a word with you Right.Of course I went to Mirave I hope you found what you wanted Would you like to have a drink? Why are you so anxious for me to believe that Uccello is dead? Uccello is dead You know he isn't Why do you say that? If you've been to Mirave, you must know he is dead I know you want me to think he is dead Just as you want me to think that Boldesca is alive But Boldesca is alive I wonder how much you do know What was Boldesca to you? Nothing I took this photograph from him the evening he came to see me He must have stolen it I don't like him.I am glad he is gone He is dead His body was taken out of the canal, the morning after I saw him But there must be some mistake Count Boria has a letter from him. He is in Milan Boldesca is dead.The police is already questioning me about him But then why didn't they come to the palace? Police and myself seldom exchange confidences I didn't get them his real name Or where he lived I don't believe it.Boldesca is in Milan,I know And Uccello? Uccello is dead All right.Don't believe me I'm not here to worm some secret out of you But that is your profession,isn't it? The only reason I am here is because I want to help you Why should you be concerned about me? Why? Can't you see that I'm not interested in Uccello Half my life has been spent filleting about in dark little corners There is no longer any surprise in me for things that come to light Evil,suspicion,fear that's my profession But now and again in the midst of all the muck you find someone which makes you realize that the world isn't just darkness A woman can do that to you You've done that to me Do you understand what I'm saying? I understand, but I wish you hadn't come You're wasting your time Time is the only thing I have to waste You want me to leave Venice,don't you? Please.There is nothing for you in Venice No?.You'll see Renzo.You heard what he said Yes Cara I don't understand about Boldesca He isn't anything Adriana what is the matter with you? You aren't taking in by his lies are you? Don't worry about him It's not him.It's us Renzo.How much longer is all this going on? Only another week,then I shall be safely away and it won't be long before you can follow too Are you surprised that he has fallen in love with you? I don't understand.Every time I see him, gives me the impression of searching for something I don't know about Forget him.Boria can handle him What did he do to you out there? Did he touch you? No.Don't be a fool,Renzo I'll cut his throat Cara I've a feeling that we almost met before Maybe Signor I've a present for him For my birthday People get presents for other reasons Who send this? Open it Signore One hundred thousand lires.They have underestimated your nuisance value Was there any message with this? Yes. It is a first class reserve ticket for the Paris train And instructions that you must use it today They do things in style don't they? Why don't they give me the same treatment as Boldesca You're English,Signore,maybe they think it wise to handle you differently But you don't They need not have wasted their money Whose idea was it that I could be bought off? -Yours? -Please go away When you answered my question Please you are hurting my arm I'm in a hurry Taken us a long time to understand each other but I should have thought you would have known that I couldn't be bought off I don't know what you are talking about But you don't have to act with me Take these back where they came from, and remember I'm still filleting about in the dirtiest and darkest corners I can find The mistakes you make,all of them could have been avoided, if you only stopped to think I could have told you he wasn't to be bribed One hundred thousand lires All new notes Must be a saint Saint Eduardo of the 100000 Lire He is no saint.He hates his work so all is his pride in himself You have your pride only in your work You think too much about him Begin to understand him.Sometimes I don't understand you or Count Boria " I must see you again to tell you how mistaken you are about me. I shall wait for you on the steps of the Salute at 10 o'clock tonight It's good of you to come,thank you I nearly didn't.What is it you want me to tell me? When you gave the money back I've learnt a lot about you You never know how close I came to keeping it I don't think you did I could have told Renzo that you could not be bribed He is alive isn't he? Yes For a hero he is a hard man to reward He has a police record I don't turn people over to the police Long time ago he killed a man in self defense Then he went desperate and did foolish things Where is he now? In Venice He was a partisan during the war Then he had the chance to bury Renzo Uccello for good and he did so Under the name of Paolo Cervo he was taken away by the Germans from Mirave And now he is back in Venice You see he is a man of great talent and possibilities and if you would have found him there would be publicity and the police would have taken him So Count Boria and Uccello trying to bribe me to leave The Count must have taken one look at me and thought it would be easy They were wrong Now I'm asking you for my sake,please go away from Venice and forget about it You'll know I'd do anything for you Does he know about this? No What does he call himself now? I can't tell you that All I'm asking you is that you should... I know leave Venice.What is this man to you? I'm his wife I was married when I was seventeen and no matter what he has done out of his wildness,he is my husband For years he was out of my life Sometimes I used to wish he never come back But when he did I was glad It was Uccello simply wishes his past to be dead so he can start living in another country I'm not interested in exposing him to the police Boldesca would be there Could Uccello have killed Boldesca because the man had found out his secret Boldesca is alive,I saw his letter from Milan Renzo killed once but it was in self defense because he was younger and wild but not now All right.I only want to get things clear for your sake as well as my own Boria could have forged Boldesca's letter The Count would have no part in anything like that What is his interest in all this? He is helping us because he has no children Because he recognize Renzo's genius And the Count excuse us so much You must believe me You are going away with your husband I shall join him later What will you do? It is not of my business to tidy up the police records What's the matter child -Can I help? -No please Can I get a doctor? No I rather take him home,Father You knew that this was going to happen Please you must believe me For pity's sake what do you think I am? Tasting this? I don't need anything Drink How you must hate me No,you are quite honest,you told me days ago there was nothing for me in Venice You didn't ask me to stay And now? Will you go? What would I do without you It must be the nicest hide out in Venice Look.You will end up in the mortuary I know you I know this town Now why don't you be sensible and leave Venice I'm staying Where would you go if someone asked you to meet you in Orfeo's glass works The glass works of that name is in Murano, owned by Count Boria Sounds like the place The night I broke into the palace I heard Boria actually talking to Uccello They are meeting again tomorrow night again at Orfeo's glass work at eight o'clock I'm going to be there too Ladies and Gentlemen these glassblowers of Murano are the descendants of the men on whose plants the prosperity of this island was founded It is an ancient craft that is handed over from father to son and the beautiful things which are made here are sold all over the world We only have five minutes to catch the boat Wait for me Guard Signore,Signore Sorry I'm late The place is empty now Signore. Do you wish me to wait? Yes.It won't be long now Very good,Signore Read that Martelli.What am I supposed to do on the basis on a message like that? How can I take action with no facts,tell me,please If there is any truth in this there is likely to be something nearer The liable indications are not susceptible to proofs but bearing a circumstantial authenticity which cannot be ignored I can just see the first great secretary in Rome smacking his lips over this So you what happened? A whisper, a rumor,a few words spilled out by frightened servant and they expect me to get results on the basis of no facts an attempt to assassinate Amadeo Nerva If that happened Have you any idea who is behind it? It's politics obviously,kill Nerva, tear up the country, and then the interested party to carry out a coup d'etat Tell me which party would do a thing like that? Don't bother But Nerva is due here tomorrow What are we supposed to do? Lock him up in a room or go out and pick out the assassin now We can pick up all the likely men in the city within a couple of hours That is just what we are going to do including Eduardo Mercer Good to see you A pity you had to rush for your train I should would like you to meet Uccello,he will be here soon I wish I could Is everything arranged for him? Yes.Tomorrow he does his work for us and then in two days he'll be on his way to South America We are taking a great risk But think of the reward.Within a week Nerva's death we'll be in power and out of weakness,confusion we should create discipline and strength Uccello might miss Uccello won't miss, Amadeo Nerva is as good as dead at this moment -There is someone here -What was that Put on the light Come on Run back Stay here.We can cut him off Uccello.Was a lucky thing you were here,Uccello Could have been in Paris with the money in his pocket Think Eduardo with 100000 lire Come on give me a hand with him There must be another way of dealing with this man None so convenient Ucello will still fire the shot but where you are standing now, will be body of the assassin, Mercer,whom you will have caught in the act will have caught in the act and killed,when he tried to attack you A man with blood money in his wallet, a hard up Englishman already mixed up in one assassination It's neat and saves us a lot of trouble I've never.. You don't object playing the hero He'll be the first man I have killed When Nerva is dead you won't be forgotten longer Mercer should have been back by now Maybe the police have got him, they have been picking people up all over the place tonight Something is going on I hope it is the police and not someone else I wouldn't like him picked up out of the canal If it comes to that perhaps I can help nice maul in the top in silver plated fittings, very difficult to get mahogany in these days But for a friend of yours You should live in a morgue That's a good idea,who would I play cards with? You said you were not coming tonight I changed my mind Is it really true? Only one more day Yes,cara,only one more day Just as well every time you come you scratch the rail here They should have painted it soon Renzo nothing could go wrong now,could it? No,cara,only one more day, we should be away from here Viva Nerva This is a great day I had no idea that Nerva was so popular I don't envy him,the love of the people can be a very dangerous thing Just listen to them Cigarette? You can smoke when you go out of this room And keep that rifle down until you want to use it You are nervous That's good, we are both going to kill It's easier when you are frightened or angry,drunk It's going be hard for you with him just laying there Shut up Fifty meters to the middle of the canal At least he will be moving, not lying like a bag of clothes You talk too much I have to,it proves I'm human During the war I used to pick up German dispatch raiders Funny,sometimes the machine used to go on quite a long way without them I was born a peasant,it was a mistake I wanted cake not black bread Nerva was born a peasant too He is going to die a martyr Keep your filthy mouth shut Coming now When you have done it, Doctor Adalberti gets out Don't worry I am not staying to be congratulated Bello,bellissimo I should have a pencil and not a gun Viva Nerva Viva Ninetta get out of here But I want to meet you but they did not let me see you You must go Ninetta Signor Mercer Did he faint? He will be all right It's the Englishman He was just making off as I arrived I hit him before he could use his rifle on me Is he dead? Minelli take everybody downstairs and keep them there until the police arrive Signorina,move it please, leave everything to me Why didn't you kill him? The child came in.I will do it now After all those people have seen him No,Longo,the police will have to do it,you bungled They'll take longer but the end will be the same Grazie,grazie Shot through the lung,only a matter of few hours before he dies Who dies? Please spare us this pretence of ignorance about Nerva Nerva? Be quiet.Teniente Longo You're the first here? Yes How did you happen to be the first here? Count Boria invited me to watch the procession from the waterfront I didn't know any of the guests and I felt a bit uncomfortable So I went to the top of the stairs to watch from the window When Nerva's barge was opposite the palace I heard a shot fired from this room And I saw Nerva fall down I rushed in here and saw this man with a rifle in his hands Can't you see he is lying? He went for me but I hit him with my revolver A few seconds later Ninetta came in and afterward Minelli Minelli? Everything he says is perfectly true, when I came in I saw Ninetta,teniente Longo and Signor Mercer was lying on the floor Now you can talk I didn't shoot Nerva,why should I? He was only a name to me You have to do better than that I've found this in your pocket 100000 lires That answers why should I And this rifle with your fingerprints on it Let him walk around if he wants to,plenty to think about,plenty to answer Nerva was shot by Renzo Uccello Will you explain to me who a man was buried in Mirave can be in this room? He is not dead.That was Boria and lots of other people wanted me to believe That's what they want you to believe now that I was a put off A few nights ago in the Orfeo glass works I heard them discussing how Uccello was to shoot Nerva Then they found me and I have been kept in this palace ever since Two hours ago this man drugged me, when I came to you were all in this room trying to pin this on me Are you suggesting that Count Boria is framing you for this crime? Isn't it obvious. That's very ingenious Stop blaming me Thank you.This man's story is absolutely nonsense. I know nothing of anyone called Uccello Look send for Signorina Medova, she works here,she is Uccello's wife She told me he is alive and Boria is helping him get out of the country This man has a fantastic imagination Yes.But at last he has given something we can check on This signorina Medova is she in the palace? -Yes -Get her Luigi Now I shall see Mr Mercer Signorina Medova We want you to help us I will if I can Do you know this man? Yes.He has been to the palace before He tells us that you are the wife of certain Renzo Uccello I was the wife of Renzo Uccello He is dead He is buried at Mirave That's not true,you know it is not true Luigi,clear the room Come,come.You had your chance Thank you Signorina Yes,yes I hear but nothing you say convinces me,Mercer Probably because the truth What do you take me for? We find the rifle with your fingerprints, you are hard up, and you have been in similar jobs before and you expect me to believe this cock-and-bull story about Uccello Why didn't you go to Paris? Why did you stay secretly in Venice? What do you take me for? A man who has already made up his mind that I am a killer Mercer.Listen Nerva is going to die.This may mean big trouble for this country If I can find the men behind the killing I may be able to handle the situation I want you to help me I've told you.Boria is your man. Why don't you make him talk You mean Boria hired you? No.But he hired Uccello Uccello,always Uccello Uccello killed Nerva Go along and we make a deal,plenty of cash and your personal safety Now what else have you got to worry about? Look.If I can do a deal with you I would. Doesn't that prove that I am telling the truth? How? It proves that you are hoping defense will fix things up for you I'm losing patience with you. I'll make you talk before midnight One way or another Uccello is the man who needs that kind of treatment Uccello is dead -Look.I will do a deal with you -Yes I'll show you that Uccello is alive Oh if I hear that name again I think I will go mad for two hours I've heard nothing but Uccello Uccello Uccello Luigi,Luigi What's happened there? Don't ask me.I am a journalist. I've just been thrown out of there Most people knock Most people have time to knock The police is after me I shall give you five minutes then I telephone Spadoni So you've heard? Don't tell me that you believe that I shot Nerva? -Didn't you? -No I didn't All right Rosa.I can make it on my own I shall have to believe you If you got to jump for it the canal is 30 foot below that window Where is he? There I knew you he would come to you, we must get him away from here quick Spadoni is coming Look you both make trouble for yourself trying to help me Anyway I'm innocent I might as well as give myself up What's innocence has got to do with it? You don't stand a chance for the men like Boria He can fix anything Most people knock If you want a room we are full up Don't fool on me Rosa,I'm not in the mood I never get the man under my bed in my life Who are you looking for? Mercer.He shot Nerva He didn't do it.He is not that kind And you can tell that? Why not? I know him better than you I shot at him,wherever he is, maybe wounded Man can run a long way with a bullet in him Rosa.Find him for me There is hundred thousands lire for you I don't earn that kind of money No.Very well.I shall have to leave a guard here You are not the first thing that has come this way I've seen generals scramble across here and cats Come Here we are,here is the bed,not very clean There is water you can wash,shave, everything is in the cupboard Lock the door after me,don't open it again until you hear me knock Like that.Right How long do I stay here? One night,two nights,it depends -What's your hand? -I got a splinter.. If I could lay my hands on Uccello You stay here I'm going to get some food Forget about Boria And forget Ucello What's going on in your head? I was thinking.There are always these marks What are you talking about? I've seen marks like these before on another balcony And I think I know how they got there Do you know where Adrian Medova lives? I know where everybody lives Do you know how lives on the house on the right of hers? I can find out But that's all.You stay here. So long as you are here you're safe. You go outside in the street,the people won't stop to argue with you Don't worry there won't be any argument But,caro signor Prefetto,it is not necessary to do that It's only a question of time,he is in the city and he cannot get out Yes,that's all taken care of, railway,steamboat,airfield If he as much shows his nose in the street we shall get him Eat and drink while I talk What's happening outside? He is still alive,blood transfusions And everybody knows what is going to happen I've got to get hold of Uccello You've got to get out of this country Bernardo is going to fix it Where do I finish up?Going razen in South Africa under a false name What's wrong with the razens? Oh forget Uccello. You know I was offered 100000 lires for you You should have taken it on the open market I am worth about 10 I am sorry Rosa.You know how grateful I am Gratitude is all I ever get from my men Bernardo will give you your instructions tomorrow Oh,and here is a little present for you -Sod the newspapers -You can't blame them,every one wants news They won't get any if there isn't any He is gone to ground,all right, we've been everywhere we could think of? In this city is like a rabbit warren He's got to come out,he's got to come out sometime -You're sure he did it? -Oh,Luigi,don't you start Tomorrow morning you go How is everything? Very bad It's happened Two hours ago He was a good man Tomorrow morning I'll come back Did you find out what I asked you? The house next door is a furniture depository,it belongs to Boria Take my advice,forget what you are thinking.Please Give him to us.We will finish him He is in Venice.I know he is in Venice. We got to find him What are you doing here? What do you want? I'm telling you,don't make any trouble A packed suitcase.I came just in time The moment you leave here I'm going to the police.Nerva was a good man I hate you for what you had done I didn't do it.Uccello shot Nerva It's a lie Why keep that up now.I don't blame you to protect him but Uccello shot Nerva and you know it I know him.He could never have done it Yes I do.They told me you have done that sort of things before Uccello has.Adriana don't you see? Uccello killed him That was the price Boria made him pay Takes your hands of her and keep them there -Have you got a gun? -In my right pocket Good for you that you did not try to use it It wasn't meant for you Come.We got a long trail you but I tell you out of street and cover,don't try to excite attention You told me that if I could prove to you that Uccello was alive you would believe me my story Yes I did Well he is within 50 yards of here now It's now or never you can walk along with a gun on my back Look at her.She was not telling the truth she was going off with him It's a lie Va bene.But the first sign of stupidity Cassana What are you doing here? You are supposed to be in Rome on holiday What is all this? I got back this evening I use this as my dark room That's the Englishman who killed Nerva what is it? Is it that you are Renzo Uccello that you killed Nerva? -Uccello? -Yes Uccello Don't let him fool you,Spadoni look at that passport with his photograph with another name A portrait of Adriana Medova his wife A bunch of steam ship tickets for the Segovia she is laying in the bay now May I see them Come on quick Subtitles by Seglora
