[plop] -Shit. -Hi, Dad. Oh. Here you go. [door handle jiggling] FEMALE SPEAKER: What's this? Who locked the door? Not again. Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob, dear, you locked us out. -What? -This is the third time this week, honey. -I did no such thing, honey. -Well, who did then? -I don't know. Someone. Not me. -Darling, you have got to get started again with your ginkgo biloba. -I didn't do it, honey. -Well, what do we do now? I need to get ready. Tommy is going to be here any minute. -Don't call him Tommy. You know he doesn't like that. -OK. Thomas. Whatever. You know, the locksmith is going to think we are going senile. -Hello? -Tommy! Oh, my little Tommy. BOB: Don't call him Tommy. -Oh, it's OK, Dad. -Son. Good to see you. -Good to see you. -God, it's been so long. -Hey. Did you say hello to your big brother? -Hi. -What kind of welcome is that? Come here and give me a hug, huh? Oh! -Guess what. -What? -Kurt and Linda are here with the baby. -How is the baby? -Most adorable thing you ever saw. -She's grotesque. -Grace. Well, can I get everyone a drink? Yeah? Good. -So how are things at the barracks? -Kurt, Amy's the best thing that's ever happened to me, hands down. -Not a little too rough for you, son? -Ain't rough enough. I'm ready to lick ass. -Pardon me. -I'm ready to kick ass, Dad. -Son, I'm proud of you. -I hear how popular you are among the San Diego chicks. -Oh, that's all rumor and exaggeration. So how's the old congressman been? -Not so bad. Yesterday I got half of Orange City into a frenzy. My compassionate Nazism speech seems to have struck a chord here. -Compassionate what? -Don't look at me like that, Bob. I'm a populist at heart. I'm just waiting for the right mop to come along. -And what kind of mop would that be? -Financially potent, well traveled. -That eliminates about 93% of all Americans. -Damn right. Do we want to end up like those peasants in Cuba, wiping their asses with lettuce? -You know, Kurt, you should be running the NRA or the CIA or MGM. -Thanks. GRACE: Ahh! Bob! -Here we go. GRACE: Dear god. -What happened? -Oh, my ring, my ring, my ring-- -What ring? -Jackie O's ring-- the one we bought at the auction. -What happened? -It disappeared. -How? -Somebody stole it? -Who? -How should I know? -Mom, I thought you said it was a fake. -Yes, but it's Jackie O's fake, and we paid a ff-- bloody fortune for it. -Well, now, let's just look around. Maybe it fell down or something. -No. It was in the box, I know it. I saw it there. Yes, this morning. -Dad. I think I know who did it. -How could you? How could you, after all we've done for you? -I told you. I am not the proper target of your unfounded accusation. -I suppose that ring just miraculously appeared in your purse. -My mind is incapable of such abhorrent comportment. -Do you realize, Dorothy, that you committed not one but two mortal sins. -Mr. Parkinson, I am not guilty of the crime you're implying I perpetrated, may the Lord be my witness. -Now, don't take the Lord's name in vain, Dorothy. You lied, you stole, you betrayed our trust in you. -No wonder. She was always listening to NPR. -Dad. -Yes? -It's Easter Sunday. -So? -Don't you think you could show a little compassion? -You think this woman deserves compassion? -Well, didn't Jesus forgive Mary Magdalene? -Don't you Mary Madeleine me, young man. -Look, all I'm saying is that I think Dorothy's been punished enough, and I think she's sorry for what she's done. -You don't seem to realize that I am far above your petty, bourgeois, inane, and insipid thought processes. -I have just about had it with your Yoruba mumbo-jumbo. -Dorothy, I'm sorry, but I feel that I have a duty. I have a moral and civil duty to turn you over to the law. And as far as the Lord is concerned, you're just going to have to deal with him in due time. -Bob, you're being far too kind. As Orange City's chief of police, I'm placing you under arrest. -Cocksucker! -Yeah, this is Chief Tester. I need six squad cars, two fire trucks, three helicopters, a Big Mac and fries, at 666 North Moron. No, I've already apprehended the perpetrator. Just get here. -You got enough backup there, Kurt? -I know what I'm doing, young man. I want to make a statement with this. Oh, shoot. -What? -I forgot to tell them to super size the fries. -So Satan smirks [inaudible] all of them and goes, got you, suckers. [chuckling] -So what were you saying? -You treat these people well, and what do they do? They steal you blind. -I mean, I know they've been victims for hundreds of years, but is that our fault, hm? -The question is where have all the real Americans gone? -Oh honey, I don't think there is such a thing as a real American. We're all a little mixed up one way or another, right? -Not me. I can trace my ancestry all the way back to Moses. I mean the Mayflower. -Isn't that the ship that came over from England full of convicts and rejects? -Could you pass the pepper, dear? -Oh, wow. This is beautiful. What is this? -It's pumpkin soup. It's my own recipe. -So how are things down at the precinct, Kurt? -You know, it's getting a little too small for me there. -Like I told you, you should be running this country. -Yeah, well, personally I think that I would do a lot better job than that liberal retard in the Oval Orifice. -I hear that he's-- -A fruit. -This is not for little girls, dear. -A homo. -Sh. -Alice. -Well, you have to admit, they make wonderful ice skaters. -Please don't spoil my appetite. -Oh. All right. Good. BOB: Pardon my Ebonics, dear, but what the fuck did you put in the soup? -I saw Dorothy putting some weird powder in the salt container before she left. -Rat poison! -Oh, god. [coughing and gagging] -For I want you to consider that hell is not only the abyss into which we may fall at any moment when the Lord decides it is our time to go but a sempiternal reality. And Satan, a relentlessly persistent presence in every single moment of our daily lives-- [chuckling] --forget, my devoted friends, that hell can be the workplace, the playground, even our very own home. -Father, I haven't been performing my marital duties recently. -Are you ready to procreate again? -No, no, no. -Well, then, you shouldn't be doing it anyway. -Except my wife has-- well, you know, needs. -I think you should advise your wife to confess. It is she who is sinful. -Except have certain thoughts about-- about other people. -Are you are acting upon these thoughts? -In a certain way. -In what way? -I, uh-- I touch myself. -You masturbate? -Yes. -How many times? -Oh, four or five times a day. -What are these thoughts? -I have a dream. It's a reoccurring dream. -Yes. -There's always a woman. And, uh, two men. -What are they doing? -It's just too filthy. I mean, it's just too filthy to talk about. -Now, now, now, it's all right. I'm here to help you through this. What exactly do you think about? -Well, the woman's, you know-- -Yes. -And the men's buttocks thrusting. -Yes. -Their bulging, throbbing-- -Organs? -Yes. -Dad, if Dorothy died today, and she hadn't confessed, would she go straight to hell? -Absolutely. Stealing is one of the seven deadly sins. -Then all Mexicans go to hell? -Why do you say that? -Because they come here stealing people's jobs. -(CHUCKLING) Honey, you are a genius. -The reverend said that hell could be anywhere. -Well, I'm glad you were paying attention, dear. -Even our homes. -Yes. -And that the devil could be anyone. -Well, sort of. -So Rosie could be the devil. -Alice, how can you say that? Rosie is a little angel. -I think she's execrable. -She is not. She's adorable. -She makes that face when she's pooping. -Stop it. You're just jealous. -Look! [screaming] -Bob? Bob? Bob? Bob? Can you hear me? Oh, you're back, honey. You're back. BOB: Back from where? -Wherever it is that you were. -From the depths of your subconscious. BOB: How long was I gone? -Three months. BOB: What? -Yes, it'll be three months on Monday. Three horrible, horrible months. -Don't let it upset you. Everything is going to be OK-K-K. BOB: What happened? -We were in an accident, dear. A terrible accident. BOB: Alice. -Oh, she's fine, honey. She's fine. -Oh, my head! -They had to operate. -Did I lose any-- -Grey matter? -Well, a teensy little bit, honey. -Nothing that a little advanced pharmacology cannot fix. You will take these pills with breakfast, and you will take these with dinner. -What are they for? -These are to wake up. These are to go to sleep. These will give you very vivid dreams. And you might feel a little confused at times. -Confused about what? -What is real and what is not. -Oh. -Nothing to worry about. -Uh-- what about nightmares? -If you have nightmares, and you will, you will take the turquoise ones. But they might give you little hallucinations. -Hallucinations? -You know, you lost the part of the brain that contains reality principal. So the ether is very fragile. Any stimulus can trigger the subconscious to erupt. Impulses that were kept in control before may be, so to speak, unleashed. Basic, primitive instincts could turn into projections. Anger, prejudices, secret fears, repressed desires, could turn into graphic, palpable experiences. [knocking] -Yes? MALE SPEAKER: Your 5 o'clock is here. -I'll be there in a second. -But how will I know what's what? -Oh, you'll get the hang of it. Sorry. My next patient is here. [baby crying] LINDA: Shut up, you little blood-sucker. -Linda, here? [baby crying] -Linda? -Hi. -What are you doing here, honey? -Cleaning the little fucker's ass, as usual. -Linda. What kind of language is that? -It's the only kind of talk you can use when you are surrounded by heaps of caca. -Linda. Linda, I hardly recognize you. -I can hardly recognize you, Dad. You looked fucked up. -I was in an accident, honey. I've been in the hospital. I-- I had this-- -You had an operation. Well, I just hope that you have enough brain cells left to calm down your out-of-control wife? -What's she talking about, honey? -Ugh! Shut up. -Come on. We're gonna go have a chat. She's just a little stressed out. Things have changed somewhat around here. You see, dear, she-- she hasn't been the same since she left Kurt. -What? She left Kurt? -Mm. -But why? -I don't know. Something about martial duties. BOB: What do you mean? -Well, apparently he wasn't getting her satisfied. -That's a reason to leave your husband? -It was for her. -Well, I can't believe what I'm hearing. -Well, apparently girls today are not what they used to be. -Well, she's got to get back to Kurt. -She won't. Believe me. I've tried. -That's-- that's-- -Look, we're going to just leave her alone. She will come back to her senses. -You see, that's what we got from the '60s-- women expecting orgasms. -Well, I must say, dear, I see nothing wrong with wanting one. -Have you turned into a feminist, dear? -No. Just an ordinary, garden variety female. -Things have changed around here. REVEREND (ON TV): He who dies in mortal sin is subject to the eternal sufferings of damnation. My beloved flock, let us meditate on these holy words. For it is only the soul that is cleansed that can be welcomed into the fold. -What's going on? -Hi, Dad. -Who was that? -My boyfriend. -You can't have a boyfriend. -Well, I do. -But you're married. -Dad, I think even the pope would agree that our marriage should be annulled. I mean, the guy hasn't fucked me since our wedding night. -Linda, what kind of talk is that? -Well, how do you want me to say it, Dad? That the great Kurt Tester is unable to get his pathetic two and a half inches up? -Linda, you will not leave this house until you get a grip on yourself. -Oh, just try and stop me, Dad. -Linda! LINDA: Let me out! [knocking] Let me the fuck out! -Mom, Dad, Linda's gone. -What? -She's gone. -But I locked the door. -She jumped out the window. -Where's the baby? -She left the stupid thing with us. -Oh, Jesus. [phone ringing] -Rosie belongs here. She doesn't deserve her mother. -Well, we shouldn't deserve Rosie. -Hello? Commander Pappard? Oh. Oh yes, Commander. How are you, sir? Serious? How serious? Well, of course. I'll be there right away. -What's going on? -It seems that Tom has got in a little trouble at the barracks. -What kind of trouble? -Sometimes I think this is just a bad dream. -You wish. -Can I get you a drink? -Well, it's a little early, isn't it? -Depends on what time you get up. Mr. Parkinson, this-- this isn't going to be easy. Let me preface this by saying that your son has been a-- a model of discipline, courage, and patriotic devotion. -Well, if we could just-- get right to the point, I'm a little anxious as it is. -Well, he has the highest IQ of anybody on this base, bordering on genius. Or maybe it is genius. I mean, one can never measure these things. -Damn right. -He's also kind, courteous-- -Uh-huh. -Clean. -Uh-huh. -Honest, aggressive, organized. Well, two words, he's one hell of a god damn good sailor. -So, what's the problem? -Well, no problem. No problem whatsoever until last week, last Sunday night, actually. Officer Krupke was walking along the beach, and he-- he-- he heard groaning. -Groaning? -Groaning, yes. Behind some rocks. He went to investigate. -Uh-huh, yes. -And he saw-- uh, your son-- -Uh-huh. -Doing it. -What? -It. -It? What? -Do I have to spell it out for you in black and white? -Well, no. I mean, yes. I mean-- -He was doing it with Ronnie White. -Ronnie White. -Our best black recruit. -What are you trying to say? -Well, I'm saying that our two best sailors are queer. -Well, I don't believe it. -Why is that? -Well, because I know my son, and I have seen his screwing girls in the back of our Infiniti. -Maybe he's just a little bisexual. -Well, that's impossible. -But they admitted to it. -Well, there's been a mistake, that's all. -Mr. Parkinson, it's not the end of the world. Your son, with his conduct record, he's going to get-- well, at least a general discharge. After all, he didn't ask, we didn't tell. Until this. If you want my opinion, your son is going through a period in his life, raging hormones, excessive sexuality, this unrelenting, this constant erection. You remember those, baby? And he's got to get it out somehow. And there are no women here, so he just sort of pops. Well, you gonna watch the Super Bowl? -Uh, when did you start? -When I was 12. -12? Did you-- enjoy it? -Oh, yeah. -A lot? -Mm-hmm. -You like it? Would you do it again? -Sure. -Uh-huh. And-- and-- -Yeah? -This black guy. -Ronnie. -You like him? -Uh-huh. -A lot? -Oh, yeah. -Uh-- just one more thing. -Hm? -Did you do it to him? -It depends on what you're talking about. -Are you-- are you a catcher or a pitcher? -Totally versatile, Daddy. -I am your father. This is disgusting. -Dad, relax, OK? Just relax. What are you doing? What are you doing? -Get out. -What are you doing? -Out. That's it. -You sure you want me to get out? -That's it. I cannot handle this. Out. Out. Don't come back home. -Dad, I love you. -This happened in your own backyard. But are you sure that it's my daughter? -I know the tattoo on that left buttock. -How do you know that? -Bob, I'm married to her. -Good point. Why didn't you try to stop her, hm? -Bob, it-- it pains me to tell you this, but I've lost all respect for your daughter. And I don't want her back. -Well, you know, Kurt, I could almost sympathize with you. But after all, she is my daughter. -And that's why I devised a plan, a very precise, thought out, ingenious plan, if I do say so myself. A plan to get her back and to get ASS in the process. -Get what? -Ass. A-S-S. Allen Supremacist States. -Pardon me? -Oy vey, in two words, the Plebeian hoards want to take over this country. -Who are these people? -These people are more dangerous than the Commies ever were. They are here already-- already. They are amongst us. -But who are these people? -You name it. Minorities of all colors and persuasions that want to see the missionary position white race weakened, diminished, and disintegrated. -Rebellion of the masses. -Yes. They are organized under a banner, and they are here to destroy us. And they will if we don't fight back. And they've recruited Linda into their ranks. -Linda's in the ASS. GRACE: Bob! Bob! Bob! -What did the doctors say? -Some virus she caught at school. -From the Hispanic teacher. -Did the doctors says that? -Well, who else could she get it from. -(POSSESSED) [glossolalia]. -What did I tell you? -[glossolalia]. -She's speaking in tongues. -This is worse than I thought. The Koreans are involved. -Honey, it's Dada. [roaring] -We just want to keep a close eye on her just in case something unusual happens again. We've given her very strong antibiotics. There's a 60% chance they might work. -And if they don't? -We may have to pump. BOTH: Pump? -Her stomach. But I'm almost certain the present treatment will be effective. Just go home, have a good sleep. We'll call you first thing in the morning. [baby crying] -Will you please do something? -I have tried everything-- super-pacifier, intravenous Xanax, Prozac bottles. She just won't [inaudible]. -She wants her mother. That's why. -I don't even blame Linda for running away. -Will you get her out of here? -Oh, out of where? -The room, the house, the world! -You know, I can't just-- -Yes, come on, dear. Come on, honey. We're leaving. We're leaving right now. [crying] Shut the fuck up! [crashing] -Bob, what did you do? -She'll be quiet for the rest of the night. -Bob? Bob? I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but they called me from the hospital. -Alice? -She's disappeared. -Disappeared? -What's going on? -Your daughter, she's been abducted. -Oh no. -Don't worry. I have some clues as to who did it. BOTH: Who? -Um, what's the name of that maid you fired? -Dorothy Parker? -Who else would want to harm you that way? -Oh my god. -Well, I've been investigating this since 3 o'clock this morning when they called me. I've learned that Dorothy Parker's a distant relative of Ernest Hemingway. -Who is Ernest Hemingway? -That black doctor that asked you to put your daughter in his care. -Oh my god. -Furthermore, I've learned that Dorothy's sister, Gertrude Stein, is the nurse they put in charge of Alice. -Oh my god. It all makes sense. -So what are we going to do? -We apprehend them. We make them talk by any means necessary. -But how can we prove? -As Orange City's chief of police, I don't need much proof. Besides, Dorothy's already in jail. As for Hemingway and Stein, trust me, I have my methods. -Why is she so relaxed? -She's had her Liz Taylor formula. -What's in it? -A little Xanax, a little Prozac, a little Tylenol and lots of Absolutely. -Seems to be working. -Didn't stop her from defecating, though. -Good evening. This is Virginia Woolf with the Orange News, and this is what's happening. A meteor shower has fallen over Manhattan, killing over 157,000 people. Inside sources say that Barracuda Pictures have acquired the film rights. The yet untitled project will be directed by 13-year-old enfant terrible Sergei I-- I-- Ivenstein. Industry analysts project a budget in excess of $300 million for what is expected to be next summer's most anticipated B-O-ox office hit. [humming] -I'm getting closer. -To what? -A breakthrough. Unfortunately Dr. Hemingway passed out when he was about to confess. -You let him do that? -We tried everything-- Chinese torture, Korean torture, Filipino torture, nothing would work. Nothing. -And the others? -You could rip the skins off their bones, but they wouldn't talk. I gotta hand it to them. They got a strong sense of tribal loyalty. -How do you know it was them? -Who else would it be? There's lots of other weirdos out there. -Well, it can't be the Jews. It's not like anybody's asking for money, which tells me we've got the right people in the joint. BOB: Do you have any proof? -We're getting it. I've got my best men on it. BOB: And Linda, what about her? -Linda. Right. [latin music] -You want to play with my maracas? Mamasita! Muchcha Linda! Ay, Mamasita! -The wise man will hear and will increase learning. And a man of understanding shall attain unto the-- Grace. -(MOANING) Yes, dear? -What are you doing? -Giving you a subtle hint. -I don't get it. -That video got me so excited. -How can you be excited when our little girl is gone? -One thing's got nothing to do with the other. -But she's in danger. -Don't change the subject. -This is not the moment, Grace. -It hasn't been the moment for five years, dear. -Well, you haven't been able to conceive for five years, dear. -God damn it, I have had it with your Catholic bullshit. Sex is not just for procreation. Sex is a normal, healthy, irresistible impulse. -You should go to confession. -Fuck confession. I want to get laid. -How can you talk like that? -Because I'm a woman, and I'm tired of my vibrator. -You have a vibrator? -I do. And a shiny black pepper grinder that Tommy gave me for my birthday. -You've been cheating on me with a black pepper grinder? -I am tired of letting opportunities pass me by. I'm tired of my mid-life crisis and yours. I want to live the youth I never had. I want to be wanted for my ass, not my mind. I want to go out with a swarthy, brooding, mysterious stranger. -I don't believe this. -Father? I am tormented by the thought of whether my son is a pitcher or a catcher. -Why? -Well, a catcher is someone who, you know, gets it. And a pitcher is still considered a man, at least in South America. -What does it matter? Queer is queer. -I just don't want to feel that it has anything to do with me. -You shouldn't feel guilty about it. It's genetic. -Exactly. I got his genes. He's got mine. -Is there anything about you that's pointing in that direction? -Well, I saw a porno. -Yes? -My daughter was in it. -Really? -She was getting it on with a mariachi band. -Aha. -And the worst thing, the really frightening thing is that, uh, it turned me on. -What turned you on exactly? -Everything-- the breasts, the moans, the groans. -The throbbing organs? -Yes, yes. I mean, the whole thing worked me up. -Well, that is sort of indicative. -Indicative of what? -Certain, you know, deviation. -No, don't say that. -Don't worry about it. A recent report revealed that 99.7% of all people over the age of eight have same sex fantasies. At least once a week. -Is that so? -Tell me about it. -That makes me feel so much better. For a while there, I really thought that I was turning-- -Into a fruit? -Yes. -What about your wife? Any action on that cunt? Uh, front? -Well, she's still expecting satisfaction. She seems to be getting it somewhere else. -Mm, so she's been cheating on you? -I find that I have to be jealous of a black pepper grinder. -A black pepper grinder? -Yes, and it gets worse. My son-- now, I may have been hallucinating, but the last time that I saw him, I got the distinct impression that he was coming on to me. -What? -It troubles me. And yet-- -So you don't think that fruits have their rights too? -They taste better as smoothies. -Fuck yeah. Nothing feels better than the sound of a fag's bones crushing. -Bitch! -I think we got ourselves a fag here. -Security! [rattling] [latin music] -Grace, do you have to parade around half naked at this hour? -Well, it's hot, honey. Hot and steamy. -Grace, please. [doorbell] -Any news? -Not much, but I brought your mail for you. Let me open this. It could be explosive. It's OK. Yeah. [gasping] -Oh! -You'll be getting Alice back in little pieces. Unless-- -What? -You give us yo money, yo home, and you Infiniti. -My Infiniti? -And yo home. -Why us? Why us? -You got one of their people a little upset, remember? -It can't be Dorothy. She's still in jail. -Grace, you don't understand. Every one of them is in on it. Every last one of them is her accomplice. -Well, what are you going to do about it? -This could be the perfect opportunity to put Compassionate Nazism into practice. -How would that work? -Bob, you'll lure all manner of societal rejects with a pseudo-neoliberal welfare program. You round them all up, you send them off to work to one of our many wasted nuclear plants. And when you get them inside, you zap them with radiation. This way you kill two birds with one stone-- kill all of our undesirables, and you put our wasted nuclear resources back to good use. -Where does the compassion come in? -You put them out of their misery. And ours. -But that won't bring my daughter back. We have to do something immediately. Let's negotiate with ASS. Let's make a counter-offer. -Bob. -Tommy. -Hi, Mom. -I thought I told you never to come home. -Dad, the only reason I'm here is to help you guys look for Alice. -I'm sorry. I cannot allow that. -Why not? -I haven't told you this, but our son isn't quite what he looks like. -What do you mean? -Why don't you tell her, dear? -Dad, I'm your son. I'm the same person I was three days ago. I love you, and you know it. -Sorry, I cannot let this man be a part of our rescue team. -Why not? -I can afford to have my men rubbing shoulders with someone like him. -What are you talking about? -Hello? The whole world knows your son is a fag. -My Tommy? -So what does that change, huh? I could perform like the best of them. -Not in my camp you won't. I'm not going to let my men have any distractions. -That's assuming your men can be distracted. -I don't want to talk about this. -You're going to have to make a choice. It's either him or me. -Mom? Dad? -Tommy-- -I get it. -Don't call him Tommy. -Thomas! [snapping] [music playing] -I'll miss him. I'll miss him very much. -I didn't realize how much I loved him. -I always did. I loved him with all my heart. Now there doesn't seem to be any reason to live. God damn it, I just want to curl up and die. But I have wonderful, wonderful memories. Moments that can never be repeated. -Memories? -I'll never forget the day he told me he had a crush on me. He just turned 15. On you. -He had a crush on you? -Oh. It was before I lost my hair, you know. -Are you trying to tell me that you initiated my son in-- -No, no, no. I didn't initiate him. Tommy had been around since he was 12. And as his confessor, I'd heard about his cousins for years. -I don't believe what I am hearing. -We were madly in love with each other. We had three unbelievable years. Then he got restless. You know how kids are at that age. They can't commit. He wanted to broaden his horizons. It broke my heart at first. But there wasn't anything I could do about that. I-- I know that love is letting go. At least I remained his confessor. I feel I know every corner of his heart, every inch of his beautiful body and soul. -Is he a catcher or a pitcher? -I-- a pitcher. And a catcher. He was just a wonderful, well-rounded human being. -You disgusting piece of filth. You deserve to die! -Why? Because I loved your son? [struggling] -Jesus preaches love! [choking] -What was that? BOB: I sent the creep where he belongs. -What have you done? Oh! [breathing] -Don't do that. God knows where his mouth has been. -Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! -Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream. [moaning] [chuckling] [sighing] -Oh. -She don't walk no more, but she can crawl. If you wants what's left, give us yo home. -Maybe we should just, you know, give them what they want. -And end up like one of them, begging in the streets? -Is that worse than losing our daughter? -Think about it, Grace-- I mean, no bubble bath, no down pillows, no frozen margaritas. No shower. Not even a place to have a decent bowel movement. -But if we don't give them the house-- -I have some leads. I just need your cooperation. -Just tell me what to do. [latin music] -You want some soap? -Freeze. Nobody move. -Bienvenidos, hermanos. Mi casa es su casa. -What the fuck are you doing here? -Linda, we've come to take you home. -I am not going back to that dump. -And what about Rosie? -I thought you love Rosie. -Well, we-- we do love Rosie. But-- -She just shits and screams a little too much, huh? -That's not the point. The point is that you-- you have abandoned your daughter. -Well, I'm going to pick her up when she's older. I'm just letting you do the shitty part. -You are a heartless and unnatural mother. -Yes, but I'm with Jesus. By the way, meet my boyfriend. -Hi. I'm (SPANISH) Jesus. -But you're married to Kurt. -That pathetic limp thing? -Watch your tongue, lady. -The marriage isn't valid. It was never consummated. -Oh, yeah? So where did Rosie come from, huh? -Ask Dad. She's my sister. She's my mother. She's my sister. She's my mother. -Are you saying that you-- -She's going crazy. She-- she's losing her mind. -Oh, look who's talking. -Young lady, we need you to come with us. -Oh, you're kidding. You're kidding me. -We have some questions to ask you. -About what? -About your sister, Alice. -What about her? -She's disappeared. -Well, good riddance. -Is that what these people have taught you, to be an uncaring monster? -I'm not a monster, Dad. I'm just having a little fun. Jesus. -What? -Nothing. -We have reason to believe that you know something about her kidnapping. -Well, why-- why would I know anything? -We'll get to that later. Come with us. -Uh, no. I'm not going anywhere. -Don't force me to apprehend you. -Hey, man. Leave her alone. She has done nothing to you. -Speak to me in English. -Get the fuck out of here. Is that English enough? -All right, Linda. You're coming with us. -I'm not moving. -Trust me. -No, I'm not moving. -Come on, dear. Come on. -Stop it. No. -Come on. -I'm not going anywhere. -Trust me. Come on. -Get out of here. This is my temple, and you have no right to be here. -Hey, Jesus. -What? [gunshot] -Jesus? -Don't worry. I'll be back in three days. -Good evening. This is Virginia Woolf with the Orange News, and here's what's happening. A fight broke out just an hour ago at the home of Jesus Loco Lopest, resulting in the deaths of 32 people of various ethnic persuasions. The small massacre is believed to be drug related. I give it to James Joyce. -Thank you, Virginia. As you can see, the bodies are literally still fresh. There's much confusion about what actually transpired. But we have chief of police and congressman to be Kurt Tester here to help clarify. -Can you make my nose a little smaller? -Chief. -Yeah? At 9:45 this evening, Jesus Lopest, head of the local Lopest gang, gunned down James Greene, a member of the Zulu Con Carne gang over an unpaid crack deal. Um, one thing led to another, as things normally do in cases like these. And by the time we arrived, there were over 30 dead bodies. We also learned that members of the ASS have abducted Linda Parkinson, the only white person found at Mr. Lopest's house at the time of the killings. -Now, isn't this the same group that's linked to the abduction of Alice Parkinson? -It is indeed. -Is this a coincidence? -No, not at all. The Parkinsons have been the target of ruthless acts perpetrated by the terrorists. -Who are they exactly? -I'd rather not say at this time. -Thank you, Chief. I'm James Joyce. Good night. -[inaudible]. -Shit, let's wake the motherfuckers up. -Hola! We got a present for you! -No, don't cry. I brought you another piece of Alice! [screaming] -On your knees, sucker. On your knees. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Wider. Wider. Wider. Nah, you don't deserve it. -You could have been a little more discreet, my dear. -Well, my mother always said, if you can't avoid it, just relax and enjoy it. -It's probably the reason you turned out the way you did. -What way is that? -A pleasure-seeking hedonist. -That's the trouble with you, dear. That's the problem right there. You simply don't know how to enjoy the finer things in life. -Finer? -Mm. Alice? -Describe them to me as best you can. -One of them sounded Korean. Another like he came from Guadalajara. The big one sounded black. -Typical. This has ASS written all over it. -But they were so cruel, these people. Why? -Hatred and resentment of the white race. Let's go, boys. We have work to do. -One thing didn't quite fit, though. -What? -Those men were white. -What do you mean white? -I know they were. -Well, how could you tell? I mean, they were all wearing masks, gloves, and body suits. -There was definitely something about them that was white. -What? -A very telling part of the anatomy. -What are you talking about? Do I have to spell it out in black and white? -Oh. It was dark. I-- I mean, how could you tell? -Oh, it's a question of texture. And size. No, it's-- you can't possibly tell-- -Like, the big one. The one that was supposed to be black, he definitely did not cut it as a black man. -What do you mean, dear? -Well, it just didn't unfurl the way it was supposed to. It just didn't feel right. -How do you know? -I've read my Freud, dear. -This stuff about black men being bigger and better is just a total bunch of crap. -Whatever. I'm just saying this because, oh, something didn't make sense. And we don't want to put the blame on the wrong people. -The men that raped you were all ethnic. -You can say whatever you like. Those pricks were white. -Oh, I can't believe-- you know, I thought that she was one of us. -You're not the one who had to put up with incompetent men. -Oh! -Furthermore, I don't believe that thing that popped up in Bob's eggs belongs to Alice. I know my daughter. -You're in denial. -I know Alice is still alive. I know it. I know it. -This is very serious. Much more serious than you think. Now, I advise you not to leave this house. I offer you the protection of my men and my very own. I recommend that we barricade this house, and I will provide you with weapons, ammunition, and the means to sustain yourself for a few weeks. -A few weeks? -We have to be prepared for the worst, Bob. This is not going to be a walk in the dark. -In the dark? -Park. -But what do they want? -The house. The god damn house. -No, we can't do that. -Why not? -Because-- I don't know. That where would we go? -Well, a little street life would do you good, Mama. -Bob, it's Linda. She says they're making her talk. Honey, I don't-- -Where are you? -I can't tell you that, you moron. I'm with the guys that got me. -What did they look like? -Well, they're wearing masks, and they've got really bad accents. Tell them I'll do anything they want me to do. -Well, you better get a condom and some lube, Dad. They really want to screw you. -Me? Why me? -I don't know. Why don't you ask them when they get there? -They're coming here? Oh! -They're on their way as we speak. -Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. -Hello, this is Virginia Woolf with the Orange News, and this is what's happening now. New acts of vandalism have forced Chief of Police Tester to declare Orange City in a state of emergency. By 5:45 this evening, supermarkets in Orange City had run out of water, toilet paper, Q-tips, and chocolate chip cookies. [groaning] -Not since the LA Riots has there been such a collective adrenalin rush in the population of Southern California. The way I see it, a good emergency kit is not complete without a toothbrush, your Bay-Rans, a strong lubricant, and whatever else you feel is necessary to get you through the ordeal. -Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Yes, there we go. Yes. Yes, yes. Come on. -Right. -We don't have time for that. [speeded speech] --shame and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth. Yea, I will praise him among the multitude. -How can you be reading at a time like this? -Sorry. I can't put this down. -Why? -Well, it's got everything. Patricide, infanticide, adultery, pedophilia, crap-ophilia. Listen to this-- Sodomorrah, 13:69-- and Samuel lay beside his wife and with his tongue provided her with unmeasurable pleasures and assuming multitudinous configurations brought her to behold the blissfully ecstatic beatitudes of revelation. -What did I do to deserve this? Hello? Hello? Is anybody there? You omnipresent pain in the ass, where's your eternal kindness, your infinite compassion? Why you doing this to me? I'm a nice guy. I'm a very nice guy. [moaning] -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I won't scream at you again if you just stop this. I promise, I'll hug my kids. I'll be nice to Dorothy. I won't feel latently superior to members of minorities. I'll even fuck my wife. [moaning] -God! -Jesus! -What the hell? -Yes? You ain't seen nothing yet. -Grace. Grace. Grace. How'd this all happen, Grace? -Very simple, my friend. Remember that accident on Easter Sunday? -Yes. -That's when the bearded one up there told me I could get you. -And this is-- -Uh-huh. -And you are-- -Who else? -Where's my family? -Oh, they're all around. Perfect little family. And Alice, adorable little Alice-- -Alice! -Come on, Bob. Don't be so fucking sensitive. Listen. This could be the best thing that ever happened to you. I'll show you around. -Go on, Bob. You wouldn't believe how many people I've met here. This place is packed with celebrities. -I guarantee you'll have more fun here than you ever imagined. The sexiest people come here. Maybe you won't have to jerk off anymore. -Go. ALICE: Daddy? Daddy, wake up, Daddy. LINDA: Here you go. Hi, Dad. -Mommy told me to tell you that the guests are about to arrive. -Honey, I am so happy to see you. Oh! Oh my-- my big girl. Oh, you look fabulous. And precious. Oh, Jesus. Love the tan. -Mr. Parkinson, Mrs. Aditto is looking for you. -Dorothy! It's Dorothy. Oh, Dorothy. Oh-- [kiss]. Oh, Dorothy. Oh! You're gonna cook a good meal for us, Dorothy. I know it. -It's wonderful to be with you here on Easter Sunday. And I would just like to make a toast to my beautiful, wonderful wife Linda without whom I would not be here today. L'chaim! -L'chaim! -Where is Linda? -Last time I saw her, she was talking to Jesus. -Mm, Tom! -Hello. Dad. Everyone, this is Ronnie. -I've heard so much about you. -So have I. -Shalom. -Ronnie. Good to see you. So, would you like a drink? A little champagne? -I'll get the glasses. -More glasses. More [inaudible]. Please take off your cap. [chuckling] -The turtle says to the rabbit, what took you so long? Oh, you like that one, do you? It's better than the last one. Wait, wait, here's another one. The rabbit, the turtle, and the snail all go to heaven. You like this one, right? The turtle says to the rabbit. What took you so long? -That's it. I'm quitting. I'm getting out of this wretched place. -What, why? -Why? Because I can't stand your bland jokes anymore. And I can't take your constant banal chattering and your relentlessly trivial gibberish. I need some intellectual stimulation. -Well, that's something I could use a bit more of myself. Intellectual stimulation. -Well, have a nice, boring life. -What-- what was that about? Father, you know this joke, right, with the turtle and the snail? I mean, it's a very-- -Shut up, Kurt. Your jokes aren't funny. They just aren't funny at all. -Bob, dear, would you pass the pepper grinder? -Allow me. -Thank you.
