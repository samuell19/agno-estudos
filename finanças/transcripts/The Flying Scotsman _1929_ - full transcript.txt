[Jim whistling] [Jim] Morning, boys -Morning, Joe. -Morning Jim. Tea or coffee? Tea. One tea, Harry. That’s right. Get the little boy his tea. Keep his head clear on that long journey tonight. You’ll get your ear thick in a short journey if you’re not careful. If you’d stuck to drinking tea instead of whisky, you’d still have your job. You’ll laugh the other side of your face by the time I’m through with you! Yes, you! And that old squealer too! Hello, mate. Meet me old college chum, Mr. Crow. He’s just been drinking to your health. What are you doing here, Crow? You’ll know soon enough! You can’t do the dirty on me and get away with it! Oh, shut up! The old ‘un only did his duty. You’re a pretty fine pair, ain’t you? You ought to be in a blasted stained glass window, both of you, not on a blinkin’ railway train! Not a bad idea, Bob, but squealer, what do you think? Oh, leave him alone! Perhaps you’re right. Mother always told me to be careful who I spoke to. Does your mother know you smoke? Now, why don’t you chuck it like a good little boy. Now you mention it, I think I will. [chuckles] [Joe] Here, stop that! [indistinct chattering] [shouting, grunting] -[clamoring] -[yelling] [clamoring] Off you go or you’ll get yourself into trouble. [bright upbeat orchestral music] I’ll get him, the dirty squealer. This may be his last run but he ain’t going to live to finish it! Oh, stow it, Crow! Old Bob’s alright. [Crow] Alright? He’ll be alright by the time I’m done with him! Was that man talking about my father? Who is your father, missie? He drives the Flying Scotsman. Old Bob? Yes, but Crow don’t mean nothing. He's had a drop too much. That’s always his fault. Thanks. [dignified orchestral music] [train rumbling] [rattling] Now, Jim, this last run means rather a lot to me. I shall miss the old 80-mile an hour. You want to get a motorbike. It isn’t a joke, young fellow. Mine's a responsible job and I don't like giving it up. You’re right. I'd sooner look after a dozen girls than the Flying Scotsman. [scoffs] Though she is a fast bit of goods. Just a minute. Just a minute. Look at these. As bonnie a bunch of beauties as ever you saw. Horrible! Take my advice, young man. You’ll get hold of a decent girl and settle down. As a matter of fact, Bob, that’s just what I’m thinking myself. I’ve found a real peach, and I think it’s love at first sight. I don’t know. Look, I’ll show her to you. I’ve got a place of honor for her. Here she is. Bless her. She's lovely. Oh, I don't want to see it. [moans softly] Just on time. [horn blows] [rattling] [chugging] [whistle blowing] [Jim] There's my beautiful blonde. And when I get back to London again, bless you, I'll see you in the parlor. It was a near thing last night. Her old man came home, nearly caught me! Just managed to dodge him by the skin of my teeth. You swine! So you’re the one! [screeching] -Is he badly hurt? -I don’t know. [clamoring] Is there a doctor on the train? Stand clear, please. I'm a doctor. He’s coming round now. It's nothing very, very serious. Tell me. How did this happen? I’ll tell you how it happened. They were fighting in the engine cab and old Bob, he hits poor Jim across the head with a shovel. I saw him do it. It's a lie. I know it's a lie. [Crow] How do you know? Because I followed you. I saw you try to kill my dad. [Crow] You're mad! I’m not mad. I saw you! What were you doing on the tender anyhow, Crow? This is serious, if it's true what the girl says. She's telling a pack of lies. She's trying to shield her old man. Look. Poor Jim's coming round now. Ask him. He'll tell you. Jim, didn't old Bob hit you on the head? No, he didn't. I was leaning out and I fell off. He's lying! -Help me to lock him in the van. -[man] Come on. We’ll hand him over to the authorities at Edinburgh. This is a put-up job! Thanks, Jim. How did you get here, Joan? I came to the station, Dad, to tell you how sorry I was about what happened last night and I overheard Crow swear that he meant to kill you. Then… Then I saw him in the carriage and I was so afraid that he’d carry out his threat that I jumped on the train after him. Bless you. [indistinct chattering] -[Joan] Oh, be careful! -[man] Be careful. [doctor] Gently, gently. That’s right. Thank you. Thank you. Leave him to me, will you? [man] I think he’ll be alright now, Doctor. Yes, he’s alright now. Well, are you feeling a little better? -Your coat. -Oh, thanks so much. Thank you. [man] Back to your seats, gentlemen. Please, back to your seats. Feeling a bit better now, eh? Yes. Lucky you were on the train, Doctor. Yes, yes, it was. It’s not serious, Doctor, is it? Oh dear, no. No, just a few bruises, that’s all. Uh… I'm very much afraid there's an affliction of the heart though. You’ll have to be very, very careful. Very careful. However, he'll pull through alright. Now, I don’t think he wants me anymore, so I’m going to hand you a very, very capable nurse. Goodbye. -[Joan] Goodbye. -[Jim] Goodbye. Heart trouble, he said, Jim. Yes, you didn’t see him wink! Oh! [sighs] Do you remember, Joan, when I told you I was a chief engineer? Yes, Jim. Well, I’m not exactly a chief engineer. No, Jim? But I’m a sort of engineer. Yes, Jim. Do you think your dad will ever forgive me? Forgive you? What for? Well, you see, if I hadn't… [sighs] What I meant was, he hasn’t got a very big opinion of me, you know. He has now, Jim. And so have I. There isn’t a relief fireman on the train, is there, Joe? No. What are we going to do? Hanged if I don't stoke her myself! Thanks, mate! There’s just a chance we'll make the journey on time. Good. [rumbling] [rattling] We’ve stopped. Yes, I don't know why. Oh, I mean the train, Jim. We're there! In on time! I knew. I knew he'd do it. Dear old dad! I’m so glad. He's won through! It would have broken his heart if he had failed after all these years and on his last run too! Let's go and pat him on the back. Yes. [groans] It was a tough job, Joe. But we pulled it off and I kept me record thanks to you. That’s alright, Bob. I’m proud to have helped you on your last run. Thank you, Joe. Well, I’ll go and report to the office. Righto. I'll see you later. Well, how are you feeling, Jim? [Jim] A bit better, thanks. Good. [grunts] Jim, when a man reaches my age, you don't forget an act like that. That’s alright. It was all my fault anyway. It meant a lot to me and Joan. Me and Joan, we’ve been talking things over a bit, and we thought if I made a fresh start, like, and… sort of… -Do you mean that? -Yes. Seriously? Good lad. Jim’s going to drive the Flying Scotsman himself one day. Oh? Aren't you, Jim? Uh, yeah, I thought I'd sort of… keep it in the family, like. In the family, Jim? Well, uh… What I meant was, um… It's alright. I was young meself once. Maybe we will keep her in the family after all. Right? [whistle blows] [horn blows] [rattling] [dignified orchestral music]
