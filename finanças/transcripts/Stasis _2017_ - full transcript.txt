[Intense sounds] [mysterious music] [electronic music] [whoosh] [silence] [distant traffic] [loud boom] [rumbling] [wind blasting] [woman] Seven billion people were killed in the last great war. Not all at once, though. It takes time to wipe out an entire species. We... are the survivors. Some say we are the lucky ones, but... when I was a kid, my mother used to tell me stories about what life was like back then. Before the radiation. Before the plague. Before the drought. At first I didn't believe her. It all sounded too good to be true. Like some sort of crazy fairy tale that's spun horribly out of control. Now that there are only a few of us left, something has become clear to me. We have a choice. [Mysterious music] We can either carve out a new future for ourselves on this tombstone of a dying planet... or go back to that fairy tale... and try again. [Computer bleeping] [ominous music] You folks lost? Is this the way to get to Piccadilly Circus? You're too late. We've run out of blackbird pie. Well, I guess we'll have to come back yesterday before they're all gone. Welcome to the Domes. Thank you. Agent Higgs is expecting us. - [Earpiece beeps] - Higgs, you got some visitors. [Sealed door opening] Where have you been? You're late. The Cabal set up roadblocks. We had to take the not-so-scenic route. If we hurry, we can still make the jump window. Get your identification, okay? Stand still. [Computer voice] Agent Lancer. Identity confirmed. Agent Seattle. - Identity confirmed. - Okay, follow me. Now, this is your first jump, right? - [Lancer] Yes. - Okay. We don't have time for a complete debriefing. Now, you're familiar with the NCNG protocol, I hope. Nothing comes, nothing goes. That's good, that's good. Now... a few pointers. Keep your interactions with the locals to a minimum. That will help maintain your cover. Got it? Some changes are to be expected. That's part of the territory. As long as your results are net positive, you can consider your mission to be success. Have others failed? - [Chatter] - [construction noise] We're all still here, aren't we? Watch your step. [Chatter continues] Now, the first jump can be a little disorienting. Might take a while for you to get acclimated to your new skins. Some agents experience paranoia, delusions, psychosis. Others, once they go into stasis, they never wake up. Luckily for you, we've worked out those bugs. Well... most of them anyways. Secure your weapons up here. Right up here. Put your personal belongings in these baskets. And then put the baskets back in the rack. You can retrieve them when you come out of stasis. There's a wash bin right here. Wash up when you're done. Thank you. [Machine powering up] Have you ever done this before? Jump, I mean. Well, we're all required to log 500 hours before we're certified, so, yes. Any advice for first timers? Well... you ever have those dreams where you know you're asleep but everyone else around you thinks it's real? Just remember who's awake. [Machine humming] Who's first? I'll go. Okay. [Tender music] Don't be a stranger. Let's go. See you on the other side. [Eerie music] [machine humming, beeping] [door clangs loudly] [Higgs] Are you ready? Bring it. [Electronic humming] [whooshing] [distorted rumbling] [eerie music] [computer bleeping] [dark rock music playing] Seriously, Ava? Again?! This is the third time this year! School's overrated. - [Turns music off] - We need to talk! Why start now? Do you think I like living like this? Can't you see that I'm trying, Ava? I'm doing the best that I can! It's not my fault you screwed up your own life. And it doesn't mean you get to relive it through me. It never ends with you, does it?! - [Music fades back in] - Guess not. Wow. Why are you so angry? Whatever happened to my little girl? I miss her. [Scoffs] You'll get over it. You're an ungrateful little brat! Oh, real nice. You know, I was gonna let you go out with friends tonight, but instead you're gonna stay here and you're gonna clean up this pigsty. [Scoffs] [huffing breaths] [trembling breaths] [phone bleeps] [music continues, muffled] [electronic dance music] [indistinct chatter] Hey! Nice outfit. You look amazing. Thanks. So do you. Do you think Matt will like it? Um, he's male and has a pulse. What do you think? Okay, good, because I think, you know, we might... No way. - Yeah. - Oh! - [Laughs] You little slut! - I know. Where are you gonna do it? I don't know. I haven't planned the play-by-play. You know, I just figured we'll see how things work out. I will drink to that. Mm, I know what you need. Just a little something to take the edge off. Just a few... or you won't remember a thing and I'm gonna want all the juicy details. Well, you're not the only one that wants to have a little fun tonight. - Hey. - Hi. Wow. You're looking hot tonight. So are you. Come on. I wanna show you something. What? - Whoa ho! - I got your beanie! You think you're so funny, don't you?! - Come here. Give it back. - No! Come on. Wow. Fits much better this way. [Distorted] Uh, you've had enough. This one's mine. Come here. [Heartbeat pounding] I don't feel good. I seriously don't feel good. Something's wrong. [Distorted] I got something that'll make it feel better. [Ava grunts] Holy shit! Ava! Ava! [Dramatic whoosh] [distorted] You've had enough. [Eerie ambience] I will drink to that. You're an ungrateful little brat! [Ava's] Real nice. [Dance music fades back in] Oh, my God. Ava! Oh... Shit! What happened?! I don't know! She was fine a few seconds ago! [Girl] Oh, God! Shit! Oh, my God. Ava! Somebody call 9-1-1! [Indistinct chatter] [grunts] - [warbling screech] - [all scream] [intense thundering sounds] [sounds fade] - [fire crackling] - [crickets chirping] [eerie ambience] [mysterious music] [Ava] Matt? Circe? Where is everyone? [Distant dog barking] - [zap] - Ow. - [Doorbell rings] - Mom, let me in! [Doorbell ringing repeatedly] [doorbell continues] What now? Look, all right, I don't need the lecture, but, you know, there's somebody in the house, and... Just let me in, okay? What's the matter? Oh! She's right there! She's right there! I thought I heard something at the door. [Ava stammering] You need to-- No, get her out! Get her-- No! No! No! [Whoosh] This better not be one of your idiot friends! Can you not see me? [Mother] Some of us have to work in the morning. [Door slams] [ambient music] I don't know who you think you are... Hello? Is anyone there? Yeah! All right. Come on, Lancer. Where are you? Get out of here! - I said get out! - [Electric zap] Lancer? Is that you? Who did that? Did you miss your jump? [Panicked breathing] - [rumbling] - [craft engine whining] [door hisses] Why wasn't I informed of this breach sooner? Not necessarily a breach, per se. The boys in Engineering detected a slight protuberance in the continuum. They've assured me it was just a glitch. Well, tell them not to think too hard. They might hurt themselves! Jeez. [Sighs deeply] Are you a gambling man, Brewer? No. Hm, no. You clearly lack the intestinal fortitude. Well... I am. [Door hisses] And I'll bet anything that the Rebels have moved their stasis chambers underground, to hide the electromagnetic footprint. - Oh. - So... it's time you stop wasting time chasing imaginary glitches and tell your boys in Engineering to track down the point of origin. Sir, that signal was very faint, barely a blip on our scanners. Even if there were a Time Jump, the Rebels couldn't have gone back very far. I don't care if they went back five years or five minutes! A jump causes ripples, and ripples have consequences! Sometimes I wish time travel had never been invented. It's more trouble than it's worth! We've got Rebels popping out of every goddamn time stream. They're like ticks! And once they're dug into a Time Zone... it's impossible to root them out. On the plus note, last month alone, we've cleared out Rebel bases both in '97 Hong Kong and pre-9/11 New York. Congratulations. That's two. How many others are out there disrupting the time stream now? We're working on that. Well, work faster! And if you encounter any more "glitches"... notify me immediately. Of course, sir. Prize truth. Aah... Seek harmony. [Door hisses] Aah. [Exhales audibly] [tense music] [machine humming] [chirping] [curious music] Whoa. Look at all this food! [Ava] Oh, God. What drugs did I take last night? Someone's up early. Oh, I'm-I'm sorry. Here, um... Let me clean this up. Do you want any of this? - No, I'm-I'm good. - Oh, okay. I need to talk to you... about last night. Oh, you-you mean, like, about the doorbell thing? No. Before that. Listen. I didn't mean to call you a little brat. Oh, um, yeah. I'm sure we both did things We didn't mean. That's mature of you. Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day we're still family, right? [Tender music] Yeah, we are. Oh, for chrissakes. I can't believe you're falling for this. Listen. I gotta go to work, but we'll talk later? Okay, yeah. Bye. I don't know how long I can keep this up. - [Computer chimes] - [Seattle] Finally. [Tense music] [phone bleeping] "Acknowledged and accepted." [Music fades] [phone bleeping] [Matt] Hey, Ava! Come on, babe, get in the car! I wanna talk to you! I have somewhere else to be. - Let me take you! - I prefer walking. Ohh... don't be mad. Look. I'm sorry. All right? I was wasted the other night. I get it. I shouldn't have left. I'm sorry. You know, I-I don't really wanna discuss this. Look. I said I was sorry. What more do you want from me? I want you to keep on driving. [Scoffs] You can't get rid of me that easy. Look, let me put this blunt to you, guy. Stay away. I never want to see you again, ever. Fine! If that's the way you wanna be about it! It is! [Engine starts] [Ava] No, Matt! Don't listen to her! [Exhales audibly] [tense music] Huh. How did I get in here? Why can't you see me? - [Zap] - [song playing on radio] ♪ What you do in my life ♪ [radio turns off] Look. I don't know what's going on, but I'm gonna try to figure out how to make it right. [Tender music] Don't be a stranger. Excuse me. Do you know the way to the Piccadilly Circus? You're too late. They've run out of blackbird pie. Oh, my God. It is you. Hi, Lancer! [Birds chirping] Surprise! Um... Wow. You hit the jackpot. Where'd you find that vessel? Uh, some sort of fraternity hazing ritual gone south. [Seattle groans] Jeez, now I thought my vessel was young. - Wow. - Yeah, I know. Drug overdose. Can you believe it? [Lancer] I'm sorry. I mean... that's actually sad. Poor kid. Yeah. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. I-I can't just leave, because the kid'll be gone, and the mom'll come searching for me. And create a bunch of unwanted attention. Exactly. You know, HQ needs to really work on refining the jump system. I know selections are limited, but this, this is ridiculous. Maybe somebody at base camp will have some ideas, hmm? Yeah. We should probably go check in. Yeah. Let's go. You folks lost or something? Uh, is... Is this the way to Piccadilly Circus? [Scoffs] You're too late. We done run out of blackbird pie. We'll come back yesterday before they're all gone. [Chuckling] You must be new. I don't recognize those skins. Agent Lancer. Eh. Agent Seattle. Agent Derby. Welcome to our little corner of paradise. Um, we've seen worse. Yeah, well, don't get me wrong, it's better than being UpTime. But I heard that the Pacific Unit is in a mansion in Bel Air. Bel Air! Whose ass do you have to kiss to get that assignment?! We should put that on the list for the next jump. Let's get through this one first. [Gate squeaks] Oh, you got stuck with a kid, huh? Too bad. You should ask the captain for a new skin. You can do that? Let me tell ya, I've seen some real bad jumps over the years. One vessel was decapitated in a car accident. - That was messy. - [Seattle] Okay, I get it. See? The kid thing, it's sounding better and better all the time. Wanna trade? No, thanks. [Chuckling] [gate squeaks] [intense music] Agent Seattle. Agent Lancer. - Sir. - I'm Captain Suthers. Thank you for making the jump on such short notice. Uh, we're happy to help. How's the 21st Century treating you so far? Uh, can't complain. Air's clean. Oh, have you tried orange juice? It's amazing. Enjoy it while it lasts. Come on. I'll give you the nickel tour. While some other stations are more of your typical bang-and-burn operation, our emphasis is on executive action. What is this place? [Suthers] This'll give you a sense of what we're up against. [Seattle] Whoa. Jesus, I didn't realize the Cabal had so many operatives in this Time Zone. They haven't consolidated their power structures yet. They're still hindered by national boundaries, which makes it easier for us to cut their legs out from under them. You aren't afraid of getting your hands dirty, are you? Not at all. Good. Who are you people? HQ knows we can't compete with the Cabal UpTime. They're bigger than us and have unlimited resources. But here in DownTime, it's a level playing field. Isn't that right? Oh! What have I said about the sneaking and the touching? This vessel's very sensitive. Agent Paseo will get you started with the data dump. The process itself is painless but-- Yeah, it'll give you a hell of a migraine. Oh! Oh, Captain. If it's not too much to ask, the guard mentioned the possibility of getting a replacement vessel. Uh, this is too young for field work. Especially if the two of you are gonna be working together. Don't want to raise too many questions. Mm-hmm. Wait. So does that mean I can get my body back? - I'll put in a transfer request. - Oh. Thank you, sir. What? So, but, wait, how long is it for a replacement? Are we talking hours? Days? [Clears throat] Ladies first. [Grunting] All right. Just gonna do a quick memory scan. See what kind of goodies you brought back. [Mumbles] All right. - [Machine chirping] - There we go. All right. Hopefully, you'll do better than the last jumper. He apparently had a thing for cat videos. - [Typing] - [machine beeping] More of a dog-lover myself. All right. [Clears throat] - [computer beeping] - [machine powering up] All right. Now we're cooking' with napalm. Okay. Ooh. [Paseo hums softly to himself] Hello, gorgeous. Where have you been all my life? [Ava grunts] I really wish you could hear me. Nightingale, I have a new broadcast for you. Right away, Captain. [Nightingale] Seventeen... fifty-four... seven... ninety-five... twenty-eight... forty-three... I have intercepted an incoming rebel transmission. Sending it now. [Nightingale continues] ...twenty-nine... thirty-five... fifty-four... - seven... - What is it? Coordinates. American Southwest. Early 21st Century. Right before the last World War. What do we know about this Time Zone? It matches the Rebels' profile, all right. Accidents, suicides, suspicious deaths. How did we miss this cluster? All the victims were low-level players, sir. No one of any real significance. Damn it, we don't know that! Fifty years ago, we were all young officers. Hell, I could be on their list for now. Or you! And nobody around here would notice our absence. Sir, do you have any idea how difficult it is to monitor all of DownTime? The past is a big place. Well, it's about to get a lot smaller. Send in the Hunter. [Intense music] Hoo! [PA system ringing] [voice over PA] Hunter Alpha Charlie 42, report to the Stasis Chambers immediately. Deputy Minister. I didn't expect to see you here. Where is the usual jump technician? I gave him the day off. Come in. Something I wanted to show you, personally. Doesn't look like much. Don't be so dismissive. The design was kept intentionally simple to avoid suspicion from local authorities. Trust me. It packs one hell of a punch. What is it? Something new. We want you to beta test it out in the field. All of this is top secret, of course. - I can keep a secret. - Good. [Hunter] I like it. The Rebels will never know What hit 'em. That is the idea. Can you recreate it DownTime? Oh, yeah. [Beeping] [machine powering up] Are you ready? [Injection hisses] [bones cracking] Let's go kill us some Skinners. [Brewer] Prize truth. Seek harmony. [Beeping] [gas hissing] [electricity buzzing] [woman choking, gasping] [distorted static on radio] [intense distorted sounds] [blows landing, bones cracking] [intense music] [bones cracking] Hm, I guess this vessel will do. - [Crickets chirping] - [coughing] Hey, y'all be real careful out there now, you hear? How's your head? Feels like Paseo just split it open with a jackhammer and filled it back in with concrete. I don't remember the recruiter mentioning this part. "Be a Temporal Agent," he said. "Change the world," he said. Maybe we were out sick that day. [Chuckles] We were "out sick" a lot. That was my favorite part of training. Mine, too. [Ominous music] [music fades] [intense beeping] Nice night for a walk. Hmm. This is my favorite part of the city. It was better before the Skinners moved in. [Intense music] You are in violation of Temporal Ordinance 19.8-4. Time travel with the intent of changing the future. How do you plead? We will destroy the Cabal before it even begins. Guilty it is. [Chuckling] What are you gonna do, shoot me? If you kill this vessel, I'll just come back in a new skin. That was the old way. It was kinda like playing whack-a-mole back then. We don't play that game anymore. [Intense beeping] - [thud] - See you UpTime, Skinner. [Dark music] Poor little Skinner has no skin. How does she keep her insides in? I'd like to report a vermin infestation. Please send someone to this location at your earliest convenience. [Bleeping] [mysterious music] Fugitive is in custody. Ready for interrogation. [Soft beep] [Chief Minister on intercom] What is it, Brewer? Test was a success. We have one of the Rebels in custody. - Excellent. - Yes, sir. We're bringing him in for interrogation now. [Lancer] I don't like you staying here. You're too exposed. I'll be fine. The mom's harmless, and the boyfriend's just-- Boyfriend?! Do I need to take care of him? Already did. - What? - Nothing. You can't fool me. No matter what skin you're in. Something's bothering you. It's just, it's only been a day. [Sighs] That new vessel can't come soon enough. We only have to wait a couple weeks. I'll be by in the morning to pick you up, okay? All right. It's a date. - [Light music] - [birds chirping] This sucks. [Computer chimes] [shower running] [mysterious music] I can't-- [zapping] It's working. [Seattle] Is that you, Ava? You're still here, aren't you? I don't know how much you can understand, but just know that this is a part of something big, and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't really important. I'm sorry... I'm so sorry that you're dead. I'm not dead! I'm gonna find a way to get back! [Matt] Hey, Ava! I don't have time for this. You literally just told me you love me, and now you're blowing me off? What's going on with you? Ever since that party, you've been acting weird. Then move on. Good talking to you. [Lancer] Is he bothering you? No, he's just leaving. And who is this guy? Listen, junior, you should know when a lady's not interested. Right? Hit the bricks. Lancer, knock it off. Lancer? Okay, you need to make a choice right now. It's either him or it's me. Don't ever give a girl an ultimatum. Let's go. [Ominous music] All right. What is it? I don't like that guy. - He's a kid. He's harmless. - No. He's trouble! You're jealous. I saw the way he looked at you. It's only temporary, okay? Stay focused. Let's do what we came here to do. [Paseo] Do either of you know what this is or what it's supposed to do? No. We just intercepted an encrypted transmission. The Cabal used a 256-bit key cipher. So, whatever that thing does, they don't want it to become public knowledge. Well, it's clearly intended to be used DownTime. How can you tell? Uh, the design is simple enough that a single Hunter could memorize it. And the components are all readily available in this Time Zone. The only tricky part is this magnetron, but those are available in any microwave oven. So you can actually build this? Yepperdoodles. - Is a bear Catholic? - [Whispers] I think that means yes. Does the Pope shit in the woods? If a tree falls in the woods, do leprechauns come outta my butt? [Dramatic ambient music] Has anyone heard from Agent Nightingale? It's unusual for her to not check in. - [Switch clicks] - [buzzing] [bleep] [chuckles] I love technology. Do you remember how hard it was questioning Rebels in the old days? Such a long, drawn-out process. Starvation, sleep deprivation, beatings, torture... and even then, the intel was usually wrong. This is so much more efficient. Do miss the screams, though. - Just not the same without them. - [Chuckles] [Chief Minister] Ah-ha! There they are! Ah. You see how simple that was? Well, it was nice working with you, my dear, but your services are no longer needed. [Machine powers down] Well, let's go pay a visit to our Rebel friends. Oh... no! [Phone rings] Suthers speaking. Are you sure it's her? Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for letting me know. Sometime last night, Agent Nightingale was attacked. Her empty Vessel was found in an alley... here. Was it random? Nothing was stolen, and there's no sign of trauma. We have reason to believe the Cabal has a new Hunter operating in this Time Zone. As of right now, our number one priority is to find and eliminate this Hunter. We need to retrace Nightingale's final steps. I want footage from every camera in a two-block radius. This Hunter has a face. By the end of today, I want it plastered up on that wall, for everyone to see. And by tomorrow, I want it covered with a big red X. Am I understood?! [All] Sir, yes, sir! We will send the Cabal a message: we are armed, we are trained, and we are ready! Now, let's go find this asshole and bring him down! [All] Yeah! [Clears throat] We might have one small problem. What is it, Paseo? The Cabal has a new toy, and it's nasty. [Ominous music] [Lancer sighs] This tech is so primitive. How are we supposed to ID anyone with this? What do you think happens to our vessels when they die? To their spirit, I mean. I-I don't know. I mean, we're all made up of energy... when it gets released, it goes back into the Cosmos, I suppose. Or were you looking for more "heaven and hell", "Is there life after death" kind of answer? I don't know, but... You can't tell anyone, but I think my new skin's a Remnant. What would make you say that? I've seen things, like messages on the computer screen, and-- [whispering] Do not let that kind of talk get out. It's dangerous. Do you think I don't know that? At first, I thought I was being paranoid or delusional. You know, first jump stuff. But now, I don't know. [Whispering] I think it was a premature jump. Shit. You mean she wasn't dead yet? Shh. I don't know. Maybe. Why else would she be here? You know that Remnants can't officially exist. - Yeah, but if she wasn't dead yet-- - So if the girl is a Remnant, that means that somebody at Headquarters messed up big time, but they will never admit that. They will pin it on you first. Do you think they'll ground me? Mm-hmm. And then we will never see each other again. Do you understand? So, before you go telling anybody else, just... wait. You know, maybe... Maybe you'll feel different in a new skin. I hope so. [Tense music] Captain! We found a match! Zoom in. I wanna see what this son-of-a-bitch looks like. Well, I'll be damned. Hello, Matthew. Ava's not here. Actually, I'm here to see you. - Me? - Yes, ma'am. There's something about Ava, that, as her mother... I think you ought to know. [Mysterious music] [gasping softly] [Lancer] So this thing is like a prison for souls? In a nutshell, yes. How do we stop it? Well, we don't. Not yet, anyway. There's a problem with the prototype. There's a flaw with the compact symmetries and compilers. Have you tried to reverse the polarity? [Sighs] I need to go back through the data dump and see if there's something that I'm missing. Um, so what are we gonna do about the Hunter? My advice... stay away. [Lancer] Why are you doing this? C'mon, it's too dangerous. You're better off staying at my place. And risk you going to jail for kidnapping or even worse? - No, no. - There's a Hunter on the streets. Then I'll stay off the streets. [Sighs] I can't lose you. Don't worry. The second my new transfer comes in, I'll be at your door with my bags packed. Until then, this is our best option. [Door opens, closes] Who was that? A friend. You know, it's not healthy for a grown man to be hanging around with a 15-year-old. Okay, Mother. - Are you dealing drugs? - Jesus, no. Did you have sex with him?! I'm not having this conversation right now. Was that Lancer? [Chilling music] How did you know his name? I saw your chat messages. [Both] You were in my room? I don't want you seeing him anymore. I told you, I'm not talking about this right now. This isn't a game, Ava! You think that he loves you? And that he's gonna take care of you, and you're gonna live happily ever after? Wake up! This is reality. You're gonna wake up one day, my age, and have a teenager that hates you because you're never there for her. Then, to punish you, you'll keep making the same mistakes, the same mistakes that I did. It's like watching your own failures over and over again, and there isn't a damn thing you can do about it. [Both] I'm not a failure. [Door slams, hisses] [tense music] So, it looks like someone's scheduled for a replacement. [Muffled explosion] - [alarm blaring] - Oh, shit! [Rapid gunfire] [bullets ricocheting] [grunts] Move! Move! Fall back! I'll cover you! Go! Go! [Man screams] [grunts] [muffled gunfire] [heavy breathing] I've located the Rebel Sleepers. Notify the Chief Minister. The vermin... have been exterminated. [Door slams, hisses] [screaming] - What's the matter? - [Door opens] [mother] Baby! Baby, what's wrong? [Squealing] It hurts! Hold on! I'm gonna take you to the emergency room! No doctors! No! You need help! You're sick! No. I'll be okay. [Gasping] I'm okay. See? [Whimpering] I'm sorry I woke you up. I didn't mean what I did earlier. You're not a failure. You're my daughter and I love you so much. I love you, too. [Panting] I love you. [Door closes] "Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as the night. And when you move, fall like a thunderbolt." Did you ever read Sun Tzu, The Art of War, written in the 5th Century BC? The greatest military treatise ever written. I can't say that I have. Well, maybe now you won't have to. We've finally reached... the brink of peace. [Crowd clamoring] [Suthers] Everyone, please! Just calm down. This isn't helping. [Clamoring resumes] The details are sketchy, but there was an attack on Base UpTime. What about the stasis chamber? Destroyed. And the sleepers? You already know that answer. So you are saying we are trapped in this Time Zone? For the foreseeable future. I don't expect reinforcements to arrive any time soon... [crowd murmuring] ...or exchanges. [Crowd murmuring] [Suthers] Yes, this is a setback! I'm not gonna lie. But it doesn't change our mission. This latest act of aggression is proof we're a threat. The Cabal know we have the power to change the future, to rewrite them out of history. And that's exactly what we're going to do. Tomorrow, we will mourn, but today, we're going to go back to our workstations and find a way to take these bastards out! Now let's go do it! [Crowd cheers] [Lancer] Hey, where are you going? [Seattle] I need some air. Get that prototype working ASAP. We're gonna need all the help we can get. Seattle! Everything all right? I'm okay. I just need a minute. We can leave. Right now. Just you and me. And go where?! You heard the captain. We're trapped. We'll start a new life, away from the Cabal, and away from the Hunters. And abandon the mission? Would you think about it?! If the mission was actually successful, if the Cabal never existed, there'd be no reason to send us back to this Time Zone in the first place. - What are you saying? - The Rebellion failed. It always fails. It has to... or else we wouldn't be here. N-n-n-n-no. There has to be another way to change things. Otherwise... it's pointless. If we leave right now we might have a chance. A chance to do what?! Stand back and watch history repeat itself? You and I both know how this story goes, and it doesn't have a good ending. And I'm gonna give it one. Seattle... Seattle, wait! Shit. Troubles with your little lady friend? It's... complicated. [Chuckles] Ain't nothing complicated about love. Either do, or you don't. It don't get much simpler than that. But life, on the other hand, now, that will trip you up every time. Yeah? So what do you do when life gets in the way of love, huh? [Giggles] Sometimes life makes our choices for us. [Sighs] Hey, it's okay. I just don't get it. I thought things were going so good between us, you know? Matt? Circe? I know. She blew us both off. Something changed. I can't help but think about the last time I saw her and... she just wasn't herself. I know how to get you to stop thinking about her. What? You bitch! - [Electricity zapping] - [repeated message alerts] [Ava] "Do not stand at my grave and weep. I am not there. I do not sleep. I am the thousand winds that blow. I am the diamond glints on snow. I am the sunlight on ripened grain. I am the gentle autumn rain." [Mysterious music] - [electricity zapping] - [grunts] [Ava continues] "When you awaken with morning's hush, I am the swift, uplifting rush of quiet birds in circled flight. I am the soft stars that shine at night. Do not stand at my grave and cry. I am not there, I did not die." [Suthers] We can't compete with the Cabal UpTime. They're bigger than us and have unlimited resources. [Ava] If you're not gonna help me, I'll find somebody who will. You. Hunter. [Eerie music] I found you. [Rapid beeping] You're not a Skinner. [Distorted bleeping] What are you? [No audible speech] This? - [Zap] - [message alert] Do you know where they are? Can you take me to them? [Ominous music] - [beeping] - You lost? No. I'm right where I need to be. [Rapid beeping] [zap] [thud] - Paseo, how are we coming on that prototype? - [Rapid beeping] Hunt-- [zap] [intense music] Captain, are you okay?! Hunter! - [Beeping] - [zap] [gunfire] - [zap] - [machines powering down] [muffled rock music on headphones] Hey! Who turned out the lights?! [Beeping, zap] - [gunshot] - [Lancer cries out] Lancer! - [Muffled gunfire] - [muffled explosions] [man] Fall back! Fall back! [Gunfire continues] Shit! [Gasps] Aw, double shit! - [Gunfire] - [man shouting indistinctly] [machines powering back up] It's clean. The bullet passed all the way through. [Gunfire] [weakly] It's my lucky day. We're gonna need to apply pressure to keep it from bleeding. [Gunfire] Paseo... what is that? Polymorphic virus. [Gunfire] If the Cabal tries to access our data, it'll wipe the servers and take theirs out with it. [Computer chirping] How long does that take? - Longer than we probably have! - [Man shouting] - [man] Go, go, go, go! - [Gunfire] [breathlessly] Okay, okay. [Gunfire] - [indistinct shouting] - Uh... [gunfire] [muffled explosion] - Uh... - [computer chirping] You'll keep this safe, won't you? Yepperdoodles. [Paseo] Go. I'll distract her. [Groaning] [exhales sharply] Come on... [computer chirping] [Hunter] Sad little Skinner. All alone? Time to fly away, fly away... - fly away home. - [Rapid beeping] [gunshot] - Maybe he got her? - [Muffled explosion] Let's go. [Distorted hum] [beeping] [beeping] [beep] There's a whole nest of vermin at this location. Please send someone to clean them up. [Beep] [ominous music] [Lancer gasping in pain] [Lancer grunting] Ow. [Grunts, panting] Oh, my God. [Lancer panting] How's it look? You'll live. [Groaning] What is he doing in here?! It's not what it looks like. If you would just let me explain-- Whose blood is that?! He was shot. Oh, uh-uh. I'm calling the cops on this one! No cops! - On your knees. - Ava... I don't even know who you are anymore. Keep an eye on her. I'm gonna go find some rope. You're destroying her life! It's not as simple as all that. [Sobs] [Hunter] If you're looking for your skin, Remnant, it's not here. Unless you know where the Skinner is who took it, I'm afraid there's not much I can do to help. Home. [Seattle] Sorry about this, but it'd take me too long to explain, and you wouldn't believe me anyway. Jesus, Mom! What did you do? You're gonna regret this. Hunter. [Distorted beeping] Look who's back. Did you find your missing skin? [No audible speech] - [zap] - [beeping] Are you sure that's where they are? Good job, kiddo. There has to be other operatives in other Time Zones. Didn't Derby say something about a Pacific Unit? Right! In Bel Air. We just have to find them. [Seattle] But how? [Lancer] Maybe something in here will help. What's going on? It's Ava. She's here? [Dark rock music on computer] - No, no, no. - We need to leave right now. No, you can't go. You're hurt. You need to rest. [Distorted beeping] [ominous music] Show time. - What are you doing? - [Seattle] She needs to know. We're not supposed to share knowledge of future events. Or what? What have we got to lose? This is a really bad idea. Think about what you're doing. [Seattle] Ava, I hope you're watching this. Take a good look, 'cause I want you to remember it. All of it. This is the future you created. You did this. By helping the Cabal, you just signed a death sentence for the whole world. I'm sorry. I didn't know. - [Crash] - Oh shit, the Hunter. She's here. [Chilling music] [distorted beeping] [muffled whimpering, pleading] [rapid beeping] [rapid beeping] [grunts] [intense music] [grunting] [both grunting] [groans] [empty gun clicking] [grunts] Damn it! Mmh! [Suspenseful music] [muffled cries] [ominous music] [muffled grunting] [gasping] Stop. It's no good. I'm not giving up. [Grunts] Come here. [Mother grunting] [weakly] Hey. One of us has to make it to California. I'm not going. I'm not leaving you. Sometimes life makes our choices for us, huh? Take this. [Beeping] [muffled sobs] Go, go! I'm not afraid of you. [Hunter] Just admit when you've lost. These last-ditch efforts at heroics are pathetic. [Both grunting] Mom! - Now's not a good time. - You hurt my mom! - Out of my way, Remnant. - I thought you were trying to help. Move or you'll never get your body back. Isn't that what you want? To get back what she stole from you? She didn't steal it. I threw it away. Do you know what this is? It'll work on you just as well as Skinners. You're a Skinner, too. - [Zap] - [beeping] [intense, distorted sounds] No! Seattle? [Grunting] Seattle! - Seattle-- - No! - What? - I'm Ava. What? Wait. You can see me?! I'm back?! Seattle! Oh, fuck... No... [sobs] Seattle, I'm gonna get you out of there. I promise. I'm sorry. She seemed like a good person. She was. - [Groans] - [Lancer panting] Tell me you know how to save her, huh? Say it! Say it or I swear I will slit your throat right here and now! Do you know the way to Piccadilly Circus? What?! What? You're supposed to say: "We've run out of blackbird pie." Seattle? Seattle. [Weak laughter] Ow, ow, ow. Come on. Let's patch you up. [Grunting] I know this is not gonna really make up for anything, but just trust me when I say things'll be better now. And... I'm sorry. Come here, honey. Give me a hug. [Hopeful music] [birds singing] Whoa. Why are you keeping that? Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. What? Nothing. It's just... It's a little weird you're not trying to kill me. That's all. Yeah. [Laughs] I'm sorry. Is this skin not good enough for you? - Should I try to find another one?! - No, no... I approve. I approve of it very much. [Clears throat] Hi, um... Look, everything's been really crazy lately. And I just want to say thank you for helping us. So, what are we gonna do now? You? Just keep being young. Be yourself again. You're so lucky to have a second chance. Don't let it slip away. I don't think I can if I tried. So, what are you guys gonna do? Well, we got a lot of ground to cover before we reach California. - Ready? - Yeah. Do you guys have to leave? Eventually the Cabal will realize their hunter is out of commission. Yeah, they will send others. So it'll be safer for you and your mom if we are... far away when that happens. Be careful out there. Have a good life, Ava. You too, Seattle. [Ava] So Mom, what's for breakfast? [Music fades] [intense distorted sounds] [dark electronic music] [mysterious music] Captions by:
