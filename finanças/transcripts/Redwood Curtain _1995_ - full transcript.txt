- 15 minutes, miss riordan. - Thank you. - What are you working on? Analytical geometry? Does that help you relax? - It helps me get ready for college. - Do you want more tea? - No. No, thank you, I'm fine. - Should I make sure that they lower the piano seat? They forgot to in Denver, you know. - I thought I was the one who was supposed to get nervous. - But you never do. I have to get nervous for you. It's probably compensation at work, I suppose. Pay no attention to me. What's this? - Oh, it's from that agent in New York. Came to my Philadelphia concert, remember? I guess he wants to represent me. - And? - Don't worry. I'm not going to do anything without you knowing about it. [Knock on door] - Am I an interruption? - Yes. - No. - Oh, just like our family, complete agreement on everything. - Brother, dear. - Hello, Geneva. - Ooh, are you ready for another triumph? - Oh, don't count my chickens before they hatch. I'm glad you made the trip. - I'm going to scream and whistle and embarrass you to tears. - You always come through in a pinch for me, aunt Geneva. - Well, but this time I won't throw redwood bowers. - I've matured. - How nice. - It's also a treat to see you in something besides lumberjack plaid. - And to see you upright. Good omens all around. We're sitting together. Let's not be late arrivals. Ooh--mwah--love you, dear. - Just 5 minutes to go. Do you need anything? - Only some time to cast a spell on myself. - You always do. You are magical, you know. - [Takes deep breath and exhales] - We're losing the forest. - Well, I'm sorry to hear that. - We're being taken over by some gasket company in Texas. Texas. There's not a tree in the state. You loved those woods when we were kids. - That was a long time ago. Another lifetime. But it's true, I did. Excuse me. A splash of scotch like a good fellow. Whatever's close at hand. [Orchestra tuning up] - Laird, she's going to begin soon. - I drink fast. No, no, make it neat. - Can't you stop? - [Sighs] Evidently not. - Not even for, geri? - Geri belongs to the world now. [Piano playing classical piece] [Indistinct chatter] Woman: How many hours a day do you practice? - Oh, never more than 24. [Laughter] - May we have a photograph? - Ok, sure. - Where's Julia tonight? - Previous obligations. - Museum benefit or charity ball? - I've lost track. - She should have seen this. Geri played brilliantly tonight. You and Julia have a daughter to be proud of. - We had nothing to do with it. Adoption's a roll of the dice. You know that. - Oh, stop being so perverse. [Indistinct] - That's for you. - Thanks a lot. - Hello, Mr. riordan. - Good morning. - Hello, geri. - Hello, zenaida. - You were a big success? - I hope so. - She was fine. Where's Julia? - Mrs. riordan went to the museum. - What are you looking for? - The reviews from the clipping service. - Ah. I'll be right down. - Ok. Zenaida-- oh! [Laughs] I'm sorry, I thought you were still outside. Did we get a large express envelope yet? - I put it on the stairs. I thought you would see it there. - Ok, thanks. - Let's try it again. [Piano playing] - So? How are they? - So-so. Nice, but not... - Smashing. - No. Not smashing. Lots of words like "credible" and "proficient." I thought I was past that when I was 14. Well, the San Jose critic loved it. That will go over great in New York. - Don't be so hard on yourself. You, uh... Played very well. - But... - But what? - Whenever I hear that tone of voice, I know there's a "but" coming. What is it, laird? But what? - The third movement. You know what it needs. A flying tackle, a run added that's on the edge. The contrast to the other two movements is what it's all about. It's darting, percussive, so fast it barely touches the earth. Pa-tump-a-tump pa-tump-a-tump... Of course it's dangerous. It's hard to keep that up, it's scary. But if you play it safe, you lose all momentum. You have to take chances. Ride the music. Risk everything. - Like you do. Laird, I'm sorry. I'm at the point where technique is not the problem, it's the connection between me and the music. That's the problem. I have to figure out who I am. - You know who you are. You're geri riordan, and you're a major talent. - Laird... I am very grateful that you and Julia adopted me, and I appreciate everything you've ever done for me. I really do, but... But none of it-- none of it tells me in my bones, in my heart, who I am. Whose womb did I leave? Whose genes do I carry? Who are my ancestors? When I know that, laird, I'll be happy, very happy to risk everything. [Piano playing] - [Sighs] I hit an a-sharp in the third measure. - Yes, but there's a bigger problem than that, isn't there? Brahms wrote a waltz. What you're playing isn't dancing. Your tone isn't singing out, geri. Tell me why I wasn't moved when you played today? - I don't know. Something's wrong. - Oh, geri, you have deep feelings. I've heard it in your music. What's different now? - I'm not sure. When I started performing, it was--it was so exciting. I got all my energy from that, and it was enough. I didn't have to think about... - About what? - About who I am... Where I came from... And what it's all about. - These are the great questions we all have to face sooner or later. Don't worry, geri. It just means you're still growing. It never stops. - [Sighs] But how do I find all these answers, schyler? - You'll have to dig. Intuition. - I remember I was cutting onions once when geri was about 5. She saw my tears and she said, "why are you crying, daddy? Is it hurting the onions?" - [Laughs] She was always so sympathetic--about everything. Stuffed animals, real animals, people, toys, such innocence to come from such a war. - War cannot stop life from going on. My sister gave birth while bullets were over our heads. - Did the baby live? - Yes. They all escaped. - They're the ones that are living in Texas now, yeah? - Mmm, with my Uncle. - Maybe the secret of cutting onions is... To have no tears left. - If we have no tears, who are we? - Then I said, if we raise all the money for the museum, then we ought to be able to fire the director. Well...Wilfred and Lucille agreed with me right away. The man is useless. And I finally brought Sampson around. Ha ha. But the others said that this is not the right time. So, we all decided that it will be easier to raise money for the new wing, if all seems well with the officers and crew of the ship. - ♪ I am the captain of the "pinafore" ♪ - ♪ and a mighty good captain, too ♪ Both: ♪ you are very, very good ♪ ♪ and be it understood, I command a right good crew ♪ [Both laughing] - The "pinafore," my tree house, we built it when I was 5. - And we would climb up there and sit and sing "pinafore" all afternoon. - And I was the captain. - And I climbed up, too, and I brought a picnic lunch, remember? - You're right, sweetheart. It's much easier if all is well with the captain and the crew. - I'm sorry I missed your concert, geri. Geneva said you were brilliant. - I was tentative. You'd have been embarrassed. - Oh, I doubt that. I would have been there, but I had the hospital benefit. It's not as though I had a choice. I am the co-chair person. - It's all right. - I'll come to your concert in July. - September. - September. I'll check my calendar. I'll try to be there. [Sighs] Oh! Did I tell you? We're invited to the overlins on Saturday night. Just a small dinner party, all people you know. I do hope you'll decide to come with me. - Well, she's got nothing booked on that date at the moment, but we got a lot of things in the works. [Door opens] Yeah, that might be fine. Listen, um, can I get back to you on this next week? That'd be great. Right. Thanks. The promoter in Atlanta needs our press kit. Is it ok if I send him the poster as well? - It doesn't look like me. - Look, I promise we'll get new photos this fall. He's got to have something right away. - Ok. - What's wrong? - Schyler says I'm not connected to my feelings. - Ah. Feelings. Tricky subject. Does she say why she thinks that? - She says that I can't go on with my work until I sort out my feelings. - Feelings defy labels. Maybe it's better just to feel them, trust them. Don't analyze them so much. If you taste a great dish, do you have to think, ah, there's the oregano, there's the pepper-- - what if it's not a great dish? - Meaning? - What if it's an empty bowl? - Isn't this beautiful? - Oh, yes. It certainly didn't take you long to read all of these. - Well, school's out. I have more time in the summer. - Vietnamese culture, religion, music, art, 20th century vietnamese history. You'll be an expert soon. - Well, it's my mother's country, and I want to know all I can. Oh, did the book I ordered come in? - Ah, the one about, uh, magu--ooh-- magiun, maguien... How--how do you pronounce that? - Um, I don't know. [Dishes clatter] - Are you hungry? - No, just thirsty. - You need meat on your bones. - So do you. - Ha ha ha! When the wind blows, we both go whoosh! Blown away, huh? [Laughing] Are you ok? - Do you ever feel like a stranger here? - I live well here. Better than in Nicaragua. Mr. and Mrs. riordan are good to work for. - I don't always feel like I belong to them. Can you understand that? - My mother and father are...Dead. - I'm sorry, I didn't know. - The soldiers came to our village. They took everyone but the children... And...Line them up... And shot them. - I'm sorry, zanaida. I shouldn't even be talking about my problems. You suffered so much more. - There is no way to measure. At least I did know them and love them. I have memories. I can understand that you want that. - Sometimes I like to imagine that I can see beyond the horizon, right around the curvature of the earth. In my mind I try to see Hawaii and Japan and the Philippines and Vietnam-- - what do you see there? - Where? - Vietnam? What do you remember? - Too much. - Well, don't try to sum it up or anything, you know, just do it like word association. If I say Saigon, what pops into your head? What image? - Bicycles, rickety ones, swarms of them. - What else? - Banners, bright colors of cloth floating in the breeze. They like bright colors. They hang them from bamboo poles, they wear them. - What else? - Smells. Kitchen smells. Ginger, incense, flowers, animals everywhere. Death everywhere. I was lucky. I had skills. I worked with numbers and words more than guns and grenades, but I still saw enough death. None of us knew what we were getting into. It didn't just turn our world upside down, it turned us inside out. - Do you think that's how my father felt about it? - I imagine it was. - How can you know that he had one brown eye and one blue eye and know so little else about him? - Who knows why the army puts some things on paper and leaves others off? - Well, there must be some more information somewhere. I mean, there has to be. What about my mother? All you've told me is that she sold flowers in Saigon. - But not on the street corner. She had a shop. - I'm going to find them, both, someday. - Geri... They were probably good people, good people frightened and confused by a war that neither of them understood. They probably wanted you and loved you. It just turned out to be impossible. [Door opens and closes] - [Sighs] Laird, is that you? [Creaking] Laird? - [Breathing heavily] I made it. I made it! - Made what? - I made it all the way from the beach street bar to my own bedroom on my own power. No taxis, no ride, I ran! - You ran? Whatever for? - Huh? Why did they climb mount Everest? Because it's there. [Coughing] That's why I ran. [Groans] I bought something for you today. Where is it? Ta-da! You better open it while I'm still awake. - Have I forgotten something? It's nowhere near my birthday, laird. - Don't you remember when we used to give each other presents for no good reason at all? And they were always the best surprises. Not birthdays or Christmas presents, but the silly ones. The ones that said... I love you because it's Tuesday, or some such nonsense. - Oh, laird. - I'm so glad one of those can still make you happy. - Of course it makes me happy. Just like the one you gave me when you asked me to-- to marry you. Do you remember when we showed it to my parents? [Laughing] And they almost died. And then you said... - It may only be a cigar band, but it's a cigar band from a $2.00 cigar. - And they were, like-- we had fun. We had fun, didn't we? Where did you go? - Too far from home, not far enough from myself. I guess I...I just got lost. I'm sorry. I know how hard it's been for you. - I missed you so much when you were over there. I was determined to make our life better when you got back. - It wasn't your fault, Julia, it was me. It's still me. I'm so sorry. [Sobbing] [Piano playing] - Geri? Geri... Your father is dead. [Single key plays] - Dead? - Oh, God, whose days are without end and whose mercies cannot be numbered, make us, we beseech thee, deeply sensible to the shortness and uncertainties of life. I wish I had known laird riordan better than I did. When I think back on our few conversations, I realize that whenever I asked him about his life, he usually wound up telling me about someone else's. How successful his daughter's concert was, how much his wife was contributing to the community, how much he admired his sister's devotion to the forests that they held. If laird cared about himself, it wasn't very evident. Perhaps he didn't care about himself as much as he should've, as much as he deserved. But that was a choice he made. Laird riordan is gone, but he will echo like the chords of music he played in the lives of those he loved. - Are you sure you two will be all right? I can stay a few days longer. - Oh, thank you, Geneva. I think we'll be all right. - Well, I guess we all need some time now with our thoughts and memories. One of my best memories is you practicing when you were 7 or 8 and laird was conducting with a chopstick, counting out the time like a metronome. Do you remember that, geri? - I guess, um... - I know living with my brother wasn't easy, Julia. None of us knew all the demons that were dancing around in his head all those years, but they're gone now and so is his pain. - Yes. - You have to get on with your life and geri's. She's going to need more from all of us now. - Of course. [Bell chiming] - May I join you? It was a nice ceremony. - As ceremonies go? - I know. It all seems so irrelevant, especially when you're young. - My feelings are pretty hard to sort out right now. - I can imagine. Sadness, fear... Maybe some anger, too. - I knew he was going to die early. The way he drank. We should have stopped him... Confronted him about it, but we were all too polite, tiptoeing around the subject. - It's very hard unless somebody wants to stop. - But we should have tried. - Honey, he might have died of a heart attack anyway. - It was from his drinking. I saw the medical report. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy. - Have you thought about spending some time with me this summer? I promised to get the piano tuned. I did. - 3 keys always stick. - They're unstuck. Scout's honor. - Geri? - Hmm? - I was going through laird's clothes just now trying to decide what to do with them and I found this. It has your name on it. - What is it? - I have no idea. It's taped shut. - Did he ever mention it to you? - No. - Well, thank you. - Julia? - Oh. Yes. - Can I ask you something? - Yes. - Do you know who my real father is? - No. - Do you know anybody named ray farrow? - No, I don't. It's all kept quite confidential, which I am sure is for the best. I assume your parents were intelligent people-- you certainly inherited that-- who would have kept you except for some...Problem. - Thank you, zenaida. Good morning, geri. I bought you something. It's an organizer. - Oh. Thank you. - You keep all your phone numbers and addresses in it, business associates, friends. It's got a page for each day of the year so you can keep track of all your appointments. Do you have everything you need? - Mm-hmm. I don't need anything. - Well, if you do, just say so. If you need help with anything... You could have a larger room if you like. You know? Or we could redo yours together. Would that be fun? - I like it the way it is. - Well, it was just a thought. Listen, you tell zenaida if there's anything special you want at meals. - I am not a houseguest, Julia. - I didn't say you were, did I? - You never had time for me. You've always been too busy. I might as well be invisible around here. - Laird was the one who decided to adopt a child. He picked you and that was that. - You weren't here much. - In my family we were brought up to do things for other people, to work for the larger good, to make the world a better place. - You never wanted me, did you? - I wanted what laird wanted... What made him happy. - But it didn't work out, did it? - No, not quite. - And now that he's gone, without him here, you don't know what to do with me, and I don't know how to relate to you. I think it's time for a change. I know you tried, at times, and I thank you for that, but I can't stay here right now. We are becoming strangers, more than we were. - Geri! Welcome to the woods! Ohh! - It's so beautiful from the air. I'd forgotten--so many trees. - Less every day. - So, will Barney be back while I'm here? - I doubt it--oh, no, he's gonna come back to pick up the mg parked in the drive, nothing else. We've agreed to part for a few weeks. Don't worry. It's just temporary. Actually, it's a relief. It's the first thing we've agreed on in years. It's funny, the way you fight about things when you don't get along. We even argued about the weather. "Honey, I'm cool." "Cool? It's not cool. I'm sweating." Final straw was selling the forest. He couldn't wait. "Let's cash in," he says, "move to Florida." Every insect with wings flies to that state and bites you on the way. Where's the food? Student waiters. I sat for an hour last week, almost starved. [Sighs] I'm too old to live in a college town. Oh, there he is. Great. Fruit for everybody. - He's one of the men who lives in the forest, isn't he? - I suspect he is. Poor guy, they're everywhere up here. - Here we go. Thanks. - Are you spending the summer here? - Um, most of the summer. - I'm Dennis mccaw. I go to school here. - Hi. Geri riordan. - Nice to meet you. - Thanks for your help, Dennis. - Thank you, ma'am. - Ma'am. Next he'll be helping me across the street. - Geneva! - Hi! - What are you doing here? - Well, mister, I still get mail here sometimes. Geri, this is Nate stone. This is geri, laird's daughter. - Hi, nice to meet you. - I'm sorry to hear about your father. Laird was a fine man. - How's your family? - Oh, just fine. My son's back at college. Finally got over that mono stuff. - He had mononucleosis? - Yeah. Lost about 6 months. Was working too hard, I guess. The doctor said they call it the overachievers disease. He prescribed lots of bed rest. Louis said it was like torture. This lady here saved the day. She brought him boxes of books, things he'd never heard of before. - Oh, they were just sitting on the shelf. I'm glad it helped. - Geneva, you know, I wasn't sure we'd ever see you around here after all the... - All the fights, the takeover? - Yep. Wasn't even sure you'd speak to me after I agreed to stay on here, but...Well, you know, a job's a job. - And friends are friends. - Let's go to the bank. I'll see if I have any money left, and if I do, I'll buy us ice cream sodas. - Um... I'm just going to walk around for a bit. - Oh, ok, I'll see you in the drug store in a few minutes. - Ok. - Nobody's reading your mail. John, I promise you, there's nobody out there to hurt you. Now, come on. You'll feel better. When you feel better, you can come back and we'll talk again, all right? Come on. Come on. - Can I help you with something? - Are you in charge here? - Ah, I'm all there is. Leon shea. - Geri riordan. I want to know about those men who live in the forest. - Because? - I'm adopted. My mother's vietnamese and my father's American. - Ah. You, uh, in touch with either of them? - No, but I'd like to be. - And you think I can help. - Can you? - No guarantees. - How many of them are there, you know, living in the forest? - A couple of hundred right around here, a few thousand total. You think your father's in there? - Mm-hmm. - Why this part of the country? - Just a hunch. - Hmm. If you got hunches, what do you need me for? - The probabilities, the chances, about both my parents. - Well, all I can say about your mother is she did right by you. Interracial children are not treated very well in Vietnam. They're called bui doi, which means children of the dust, and they're considered ugly. As far as your father, if he's in these woods, or any other, he's not likely to welcome you with open arms. These guys barely escaped the bamboo curtain. Now they just want to get lost behind the redwood curtain. And they don't like people invading their territory. - I'm not going to invade anybody. - Look, most of them have a hard enough time dealing with day-to-day stuff, with surviving their nightmares. Having a long-lost daughter show up may be something that one of them just can't handle. - Well, I'm going to try anyway. - I suggest you stay away from the forest. Some of those men are dangerous, and there is no way to know how they'll behave. - That's true. - Where did you go? I had my heart set on a chocolate soda. It was going to be my reward for getting all that exercise. - I just went into that counseling center for a while. - The one for vets. Why? - I was trying to find out more about my father. - Laird was your father. - He was my pal, and a good one... Especially when I was a kid, but he was my adoptive father. - You know, you're very lucky. Most kids have no proof when they feel there must have been some tragic mix-up in the hospital and these people they live with couldn't possibly be their real parents. You at least know you were adopted. That should be some consolation. - Yeah, but I don't want to go through life not knowing who my real father was. - Out of all the thousands of men who went to Vietnam and came back, do you think you can find him? - Yes. - How? - Well, I don't know yet, but I have these hunches, these feelings I have to follow. You know, he might even be in this forest. - Where did you get that hunch? - On the airplane. I looked down and I saw this ocean of trees. And then I felt it. You know, even when I was walking through town today, I felt this heat on my skin. - Oh, come on. - Honest. Haven't you ever felt that before? - Sure, but usually it's the beginning of a bad case of poison oak. Ohh. Look, I understand you might have a lot of feelings about all this stuff-- adoption, war-- but what can you do, honey, wander around the woods calling out for your father? Whatever guys are living out here are doing it because they want to be left alone. Most of them are army men, you realize, trained at great expense to be homicidal. They took booby traps 101 and graduated. - That's just a stereotype, aunt Geneva. I can take care of myself. - Well, then do it, take care of yourself. Smell the flowers. You said you were here to relax. So, relax. [Cawing] [Dog barking] - Excuse me! Can you just indicate the general direction back to civilization? I got turned around here and I want to go home. I know you can talk. I heard you yelling at your dog. - [Grunts] - Hey! [Dog barking] What is wrong with you? Stop that! - [Grunts] - Uh! I just want to talk. Why were you watching the house? Stop! [Grunting] - I don't have a single family memory that isn't connected to these trees. We were harvesting trees my great-great-grandfather planted. I'm afraid this new company is just going to come in and mow them all down. - Why did you sell? - I didn't. - We opened to public stockholders 10 years ago. They outnumbered us. - Was your family always in the tree business? - Yes, as far as I know. Oh, you see that guy right there on the left? He was my grandfather's cousin, I think. He was a wonderful woodcarver. At least that's what I was told as a child. We used to have one of his pieces around here. I wonder what happened to it? - Yeah, he does look like the weirdo of the family. - Now, watch it, you're in the family, too. And an artist. - In the same family. I don't feel much like it sometimes. - Oh, of course you are. You're a riordan just as much as I am. - Well, not quite, aunt Geneva. An Irish name and an Asian face. - It's not exactly "the New York times," is it? - What? - The local rag, all 8 pages. - Ha. Oh, this. Um, well, actually, it's fun to read, especially the, uh, sheriff's reports. - Yeah. Lady complained about cow in kitchen, deputy investigated. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. I heard you play keyboard. - Uh, yeah, a little. - You know, we've got a great little band up here. I play bass. We've got a terrific lead guitar player. You want to jam with us sometime? - Um, I don't think I'd be right for your group. I only play classical music. - Ohh. Ok, listen, how about some coffee, or do you only drink tea? - Oh, no, anything with caffeine. - Caffeine we've got. Lots of it, right down the street. Uh, look, I'd really like to, but--but I can't. Not right now. - Sure. Maybe some other time. - Ask me again, ok? - Ok. - I'll stop if you will. I'm quite harmless... And alone. I love these trees. Don't you? They're the whales of the earth. Knowing how long they've lived here... Thousands of years... It must be comforting to live among them. I understand you might be... Afraid of me, but I just want to talk for a while, ok? Uh, right here. I won't follow you any further. - You think I'm blind?! You've been following me all the way from town! You think I'm going to lead you to my place? You and your buddies, you come back and you steal my stuff! - Wait! I don't care about your stuff! - No more tricks, no more lies! No more, no more, no more! No more! You stay away! You leave me alone! - I'm afraid I can't. I'm a driven person about everything. If I leave now, I'll be back tomorrow and the next day. I'm incredibly stubborn, so you might as well spend a minute or with me now, please. - Throw me your bag. - What? - Throw me your bag. - Uh, well, I don't have much cash, but-- [screaming] You can keep the cash, ok, but I really need a lot of the other stuff. - Did you steal this wallet? - No, it's mine. - You ain't no Geraldine, you're a Lee, you're a Lee han or-- - no, I was adopted by the riordans. They gave me an American name. - What do you want? Why are you here? Why are you following me? - You see the, um, the photo in there? The one from Vietnam? That group of soldiers. It was taken about 19 years ago. Do you know any of those men? - No. - Are you sure? - I said no. [Muttering] - What? - Go. They'll get you. Go. [Helicopter] Ghosts, they're ghosts. [Helicopter] - You mean they're all dead? - Buried. Some walking around--ghosts. - Like you? Are you... Are you my father? Is your name ray farrow? - No. No. - Would you tell me if you were? Would you? - Yes. - I need to see your eyes when you say that. One eye is brown... The other one is blue. Ohh... [Forest animal sounds] [Coyotes howling] [Vehicle approaching] - Aah! - You all right? I came around that turn and you were just there. There's never anybody on this road at night. Here. Come on. - Oh, Mr. stone. - Uh-huh. - Yeah, I'm fine. I just want to go to Geneva's, please? - Come on, here. You sure you're all right? - Let me get this straight. You were in the woods, some man was in the woods, and you fainted. Did he jump out from behind a tree or something? I'm trying to construct a plausible scenario here. Just because you're an 18-year-old genius doesn't mean you know how to take care of yourself. - I just got a little dizzy. - A little dizzy. You were out for a long time. Do you feel sick? - No. Just stupid. - Well, that's a relief. We all feel stupid sometimes. - I just remembered... He's got my wallet. - Your wallet?! Well, we've got to do whatever it is you do when you lose a wallet. Uh, I got to call the credit card people. I've got that number someplace. Oh, if I've lost it... - Calm down, aunt Geneva, I'm not worried. He's not exactly the shop-till-you-drop type. He only seemed interested in some photograph from Vietnam. - Where are you? Why are you hiding? I'll wait. I'll stay here as long as it takes. Ok. [Dog whines] - Oh! Oh, you startled me. Can I help you? - You know this girl? - That's my niece. - What's her name? - Geri riordan. It's right there. - Who's that? - Her father. Well, he's dead now. - He drink himself to death? - Laird was my brother. He came home from the war very troubled. You might understand that. Or not. - Does she live here? - No. Now, if you'll just-- - count the money. - It's fine, I'm sure. - Count the money! - I'm sure it's-- well, why not? 50... It's remarkable to get it back with that much cash. - Where would I break a $50 bill? - There are many bars here that would happily serve a baboon for the price of a drink. Not that you're the least bit baboon-like. - You let her follow people around town? - Thank you for returning this. - Does she ever tell the truth about anything? - I'm very glad to have it back. Now, if you'll just... - She said her real dad's name was ray farrow. - You keep your dog tags on your dog. That's very... This is you? Lyman fellers? Why didn't you tell geri your name? - I don't like it out. Don't... Tell people. - She's... Developed this obsession about finding her real father. I don't know what to do about it. Would you like something to eat? - Nah, I'm ok. - Thank you for... - You tell your niece I ain't her father. Come on! - Lyman fellers. Why does that sound familiar? Lyman fellers. - I knew you'd come. - I ain't your father. You got that? I ain't nobody's father. I got nothing for you! I got nothing for you! - My mother's people fought a war that lasted half a century! First the French, then the Americans! We never give up! I'm going to follow you. I'm going to keep following you! You can't get away from me! - Now, there's a mark up on that Ridge there. We're going to have to... [Indistinct conversation] - Some of the traps, they come up from the ground. Some come down from the trees. No matter, they all do the same thing. - This is amazing. Where do the others live? I never see them. - They don't want you to. They're--everybody just moves around. I was in the last group out... On the last day... Last hour... Roof of the embassy. My job was to keep them off the choppers. There was hundreds of South vietnamese all wanting... There weren't no room for them. And I had to kick them. Push them off the... The doors. The bird never would have lifted off the ground if they had held on. They'd all die right there. - But you got out... And came here. Why? Aren't you tired of living like this? - I don't sleep in the street, and I don't eat garbage. I eat ok, I sleep ok, I don't care what other people do. That's them, I'm me. - Where do you get your food? - Different places. There's a bakery downtown, there's a lady who leaves bread out sometimes for us. - What happens when you get sick? Who takes care of you? How do you keep warm in the wintertime? Please talk to me. I have to know. - Why? What are you? You're just passing through. - No. No, I'm not just passing through. I'm trying to find some roots, some connections. - I ain't the one to help you. - Well, I think you are. - Well, you can think anything you want. - Why won't you just admit it? - I got nothing to admit! I got nothing to admit! Nothing! Eh! I'm going back. Town's that way. - Now you go off and disappear and that's the end of it? - You're looking for a father. I ain't your father. - Then who are you? You haven't even told me your name. - Dennis! Have you seen geri? - No, not today. - If you do, will you tell her I'm looking for her? - Sure, will do. - Thanks. - Geri? Geri? Geri! - I'm in here. - Where have you been? I thought you were dead, kidnapped, drugged. - In that order? - Oh, don't get funny with me, miss nonchalant. Next time, I won't give this back to you. Your friend from the woods and his dog dropped by the house earlier today. - Here? Why? - To show me his dog tags, I guess. Verbal communication is not one of his best skills. - What was the name on his dog tags? - Well, it wasn't ray farrow. I guess that was his point. So, can you forget about him now? - No. How do we know--how do we know they were his dog tags? - Because they were on his dog. - Well, if he isn't ray farrow... Oh, he knows something. I can sense that. - You're not going to get within 50 yards of that man again, unless I'm there. - He brought me to where he lives. I made a map on the way back. It's somewhere--it's somewhere near here. It's not that far. - Why you want this strange person to be your father is beyond me. - It's not a question of what I want or what I don't want. It's a question of what is true. - Oh, for this I have to get lyme disease. Look, I'm not saying the man is trouble, but he's not well, geri. He's been-- I'm trying to think of a way to talk about the man without sounding prejudiced or paranoid. Well, I can't. He's just someone to stay away from. - He let me follow him last time. He brought me to his camp. It's, well, sort of-- it's organized. He's not an animal. He eats with a spoon, he tries to keep clean, he reads. It's not what you think. - You really want to go back in there, don't you? Ok, in the morning, together. - Yes. Thank you. - After breakfast. Why... - Thank you, thank you, thank you. I barely spoke English but I spoke with an Asian accent. Turning the rs into ls and the ls into rs. Ryman... Ferrels. Ryman ferrels. Ryman...Raymond farrow. Raymond farrow. Raymond farrow. I think we're almost there. - You know, the redwoods were here before the pyramids. In a couple of years, it will probably be a parking lot. - Careful, there's a trap. Hello! - This is it? Geri. - Are you here? If you are, I know you'll come out when you want to. You never told me his name. Why not? - His name is lyman fellers. Fellers, farrow, farrow, fellers. Lyman, ryman, get it? Lyman fellers, Raymond farrow. I mean, they're close enough to cause some confusion. If they'd asked your mother what your father's name was and she said lyman fellers, her accent would probably make it sound like... Both: Raymond farrow. - That must be how it happened. He must be my father, but will he admit it? - You're going to find out if he's willing to tell you anything about the circumstances of your birth, apologize for bothering him, and we're getting out of here. I don't want you hassling him. - Well, if he's my father, I'm not just going to leave him here. - If that's what he wants, you certainly will. - It's not what he wants. - You don't know that. - I know that. - You do not. - I do, too, I--I sense things about him. I know we have some connection even if I don't know exactly what it is. - I held you in my arms. You were nay bigger than that. At a week old... Your mother handed you to me. - My mother. What was her name? - Laycha, uh, leah... I can't say it right, but... She wasn't no kid. She owned a flower shop like you said. She was a beautiful lady. Smart like you. - Why did she give me away? - She--she'd have kept you, but she knew what would have happened. That wasn't no place for a kid like you. In Vietnam you'd have been an outcast. She wanted you here. She wanted you to have a life with your dad. - With you. You are my father, aren't you? - No, I'm not. I'm not your father. - But you know who is. - Mmm. - Am I to understand you knew geri's parents in Vietnam? - That's how I knew her. - You can pick one child out of thousands of orphans and recognize her 18 years later? - I saw you in town. It's like seeing your mother all over again. Same colors she used to wear, same... Whew. See, your dad was real proud. He had us come in the back of the flower shop and showed you to us. We passed you around. He couldn't bring your mother over here. He already had a wife in the states. But he wanted to keep you. - Then why didn't he? - He did. He just fixed it with the adoption people. - Oh, dear. - What, he never told any of you? - He couldn't have told any of us without Julia knowing sooner or later. - Laird was my father? - Your father was always restless. As a boy and as a man. Always wanting to be more than he was. He was no good at business, making money. He had no ambitions in that direction. All he ever wanted to be was a concert pianist. But he was afraid he didn't have what it takes, so he gave up on that idea and he hated himself for giving it up. Maybe that's why he went to Vietnam. I don't know. - He really wanted me to know, didn't he? Otherwise, he wouldn't have left me that box with the photograph in it. Pressed flower must have been my mother's. But why? Why was he so afraid that he couldn't be open? Was it--was it because of Julia? - Don't judge him, honey. He was fighting battles we know nothing about. I know he loved Julia and he would never hurt her. Couldn't share his secret. Finally, he couldn't live with it. - I just wish he could've told me. I just wish he... I just wish he could've told me. Laird was playing this one day and I sat down beside him and started playing the piece with him. I was about 6. He was so surprised that tears started rolling down his cheeks. I asked him why he was crying, and he said that sometimes people cry because they're so happy they can't laugh. He told me that if I trusted my feelings and followed where they took me, I'd find out who I was. But he didn't tell me that once I got there, I'd miss him so much. [Playing] - My dad had a garage I worked in. We used to drag race muscle cars using little jet heads. I met this girl at a race once. I asked her what kind of perfume. She said it was just soap. I used to go into drug stores and smell all the soaps. Never found it. - You can smile. - I don't know how to be with people. I ain't got nothing for them. - You gave me a lot already. You gave me my father. - I, uh... Made you something. - Thank you. You know, you don't have to live like this. You could come out of the forest. I could help... When you're ready. - Hmm. - How will I find you? - You found me once. Maybe next time I'll find you! [Piano playing] [Cheering and applause]
