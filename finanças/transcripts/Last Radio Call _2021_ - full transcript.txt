I'm sorry, can't copy you. Copy. You know, it's probably just some crackheads, if I'm gonna be honest. You're probably right. Either way, I'm wanna get this one over with. Police department. Police department, let yourself be known. Jesus. Go, go, go. Watch that door. All right, I'm gonna check down this hallway. Circle back. Copy that. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Police department, if there's anyone in here, let yourself be known. 10-33, requesting immediate backup. David, where are you? I try and draw him as often as I can just to keep his head fresh in my mind. Pictures, all that, they're just, kinda, too real for me right now. I wanna remember David as he actually was. I wanna remember David when he was with me. It's hard losing somebody so close to you overnight, especially without answers. They say that time heals all wounds. And that's bullshit, obviously. But what time can do really is help you get a little bit better at pretending that you're whole again. And that'll be fine, later. I need an answer. I need something I can hold on to. I need something that makes sense. After that, I will gladly move on. This is where David disappeared, Yorktown Hospital. Afterwards, I went back there every day for a month, just trying to get a feel for the place, you know? Just trying to figure out what happened. And I was the only one out there, except for the security guard. David was last seen by his police partner who survived without a scratch and with zero memory of what happened. Inconvenient, right? I called the station every day for a month. They didn't wanna talk to me. Nobody wants to talk to me. All I could find out was the one thing left at the scene was his body cam. Footage is classified, but some genius leaked a small portion of it online. Cuts off at the end, so no answers there. I think the point of this really is to find truth, to find answers. Somebody out there knows what happened to David. Maybe if somebody sees this, they'll realize that they know something that can help. But more than that, I want people to know David. I don't wanna be the only one who cares about him anymore. I don't wanna be the only person who cares what happened to him. I want people to see and understand. I want people to know how after years of service, the department just threw him away like trash. Okay, this is the house of one of David's supervisors. He was working when David went missing, and he resigned a month after the incident. He never released any info or even attempted to talk with me. Whoa, whoa, whoa what the hell's going on here? What the hell is all this? I just have some questions I'd like to ask. I want to know what happened. Get some therapy. Get a life like the rest of us. I need for both of y'all to get the hell off my property. Why did you quit your job? Right now! Off to a great start. Okay, is the house of David's ex partner, last person to see him alive. He hasn't exactly been super helpful in the past, but it's worth a shot. Giles, can you tell me what happened that night? Yeah, there was a disturbance call, the hospital. We went in and checked it out. It was nothing out of the ordinary. We heard something, so we went a bit deeper. We split. You split up. Why? I don't know. We wanted to see if there was anyone back there. Was there anyone? Yeah. I don't know, it was just... a head. A head? Then he called on the radio. I ran for the church doors. Hey, hey, calm down. Giles, whoa! Giles, Giles, Giles, we're going. 911, what's your emergency? Hi, I was walking by the old Yorktown Hospital and I heard this weird screaming coming from inside. Okay, ma'am. We're going to send a police officer there very shortly. There's already a police car here. There is? Yes. Actually, we passed the hospital on the way here. How long have you lived in the area? Well, I can tell you, I've lived here pretty much all my life, and that hospital has been weird, even before they closed down in 1986. You have to realize this was a religious hospital, and they took in alcoholics and drug addicts. And those were some of the most tortured souls that you can imagine. The night you made the 911 call. Are you normally taking walks late at night? Well, it sounds like I'm being a bit of a suspect now. Doesn't it? Not at all. I'm just trying to get as many details as possible. Well, I have terrible insomnia, and this area is pretty safe, and I just wanted to take a walk to calm down a little bit. And I was walking past and I heard this horrible scream. Like a person scream? Definitely not a person. I got a video of the sound, definitely wasn't human. Wait, you have a video? Can I see it? Yeah, take me a minute to find it. Okay. Got it. I have your number from earlier, and I'll just send it over to you. See what you think. There you go. I have no idea what the police would be interested in this. What time did this happen? Right at 3:00 AM, witching hour. What? Witching hour, you know, people say weird things tend to happen at 3:00 AM. Witching hour. Yeah. But it's probably just some urban legend, right? It's 3:00 AM now, and we're not really seeing anything or hearing anything. I know I said we were just gonna wait outside, but how would you feel if we tried to get in? This way. Hey! Go, go, go! No one wants to talk to you. No one will fucking talk to you. Fuck. Well, I now have criminal trespass to add to my repertoire, and it comes with a $2,000 fine. Perfect. This is going so well. Oh, God. I think maybe we should call this quits, you know? This isn't really going anywhere. At least not anywhere good, so yeah, bye. You fucked up, 'cause that's not me, and that's never gonna be me. I'm loud and I'm pissed off, and I'm not gonna stop, even if I can't make this fucking movie. Never gonna stop. Not until I find out the truth about what happened that night. The truth is mine. I own it, and I'm never going to stop coming for it. I have no life and no shame, and I'm not gonna stop. I will find him. I will find him again. Where are you? It's not funny. Okay, so this happened three nights ago. It got uploaded last night. Everywhere took it down, except for this weird Russian place. Some kids broke into Yorktown Hospital. One is missing, the other has been taken in for a psychological evaluation, but isn't saying much. This is it. This is exactly what we needed. This proves that there's something going on. That I'm not crazy. I mean, I'm not crazy, but yeah, we need to keep going. We need to figure out what the hell is going on there. It's not just about me. It's not about David. We have to do it for these kids as well. Hello? Someone told me about what happened to the kids the other night. Yeah, it's terrible. I may have some things that might help. Come by soon as possible. Oh, okay. I'll be right over. I'm a little hesitant to go back, considering the last time we saw him he pointed a gun at us, but he sounded really desperate. Should we call the police? No, fuck that. Let them figure it out themselves. We need to go. This was David's radio. Why would Giles still have this? Why wouldn't he turn it in? It's dead. Shit, looks like he was having some pretty fucked up dreams. Tape recorder with tape. It's okay. I just want you to first take a deep breath, and clear your mind. Just get used to the rhythm in your head, Giles. Okay. I want you to picture the very last frame of what you saw that night. I can't. Giles, please. This is to help you. Just picture that very last image, like a Polaroid. Then we can erase it. It's tall. What do you see? So tall, and its arms are long like a bunch of sticks. Good, good. What else do you see? It's looking at me. Who's looking at you? Giles, what do you see now? Giles? Giles? What the hell was that? There's just a phone number. It's worth giving that a call, I think. Hello? Hello, yes, this is Sarah Serling. I found your phone number. I know who you are. I've been waiting for your call. Is this line secure? For a few years, I was in charge of archiving the raw video data from the city's police bodycam program. One night, when I was working, I came across some footage that kept me up for nights. Footage involving your husband. After the incident, the station took over, and deleted everything off the servers. But I made a backup. I'm gonna text you some coordinates. Be there in one hour and come alone. Stay here. The truth is all in the footage, but it won't be easy to find. There's thousands and thousands of hours of raw video. Why are you helping me? That footage is scratching to get out into the world. It needs someone to open the cage. Is my husband dead? It's worse than death. Okay. There's thousands of hours of video here. I don't know what I'm supposed to... Police department, anybody in here? Show your hands. Make yourself known. Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Right now! Did you copy that? Wait, okay. Serling July 15th, three days before he disappeared. Police department. 10-33, I need immediate backup on Black Valley Road. I repeat, Black Valley Road. Police department. You have been chosen, my friend. Put the weapon down, now! The Red Sister has shown me your face in my visions. Put the weapon down or I will fire. Put it down! She is eternally hungry. Put the weapon down. 10-33, suspect down. Wait, that symbol, the symbol on the girl. We've seen that before. It was at Yorktown. Can you recall that footage? Can we see it again? It's the same symbol, identical. Let's see who this guy is. It says it was a murder-suicide. Doesn't make sense. We saw David shoot him. This is the guy from the video. Wait, he has a different name? Hello. Hi, is this Benny Pelayo? That's me. How can I help you? Yeah, I was wondering if you were perhaps related to Dan Pelayo. Don is my brother, but we really haven't spoken in many years. Ah, I see. I'm investigating a disappearance, and his name came up. I was wondering if maybe I could talk to you. Why don't you come by tomorrow around noon? Okay. We'll be there. Thank you. It looks like we have plans tomorrow. Hey, what time is it? It's 11 AM. Shit. I was up all night going through those videos. Trying to find any more of David's, and, yeah, I got a little distracted, sorry. Can you give me a second? Hi. Benny? I'm Benny. You must be Sarah. Yeah. What's with all this? We're just filming all our interviews with people. I hope that's okay. Well, I see. Please, come inside. Don was my twin brother. We both were heavily involved in the shamanistic side of Native American culture. It's in our blood, you see. Although, I practiced more of the lighter side of things. He was into the darker stuff. What about his suicide? He did not commit suicide. I can promise you that. It must've been a setup. He must've been into something rotten. A cover-up? Why? I don't know what type of information you're looking for here, but this whole town has been built upon hexed land. They knew it then, and they know it now. For years, weird things have been happening around here. And they've been coming down here trying to cover things up. And this city is already on the verge of poverty. The last thing they need is more bad press. I understand that. My husband was a police officer, and he went missing in yorktown hospital. They just pretend nothing happened. It doesn't surprise me a bit. Yorktown has always been a hotbed of evil, unnatural activity. What about this? Have you seen this symbol before? Where did you see this? I saw it on the wall in Yorktown and in a video with your brother. That is the sign of the Red Sister, a kind of Skadegamutc, or ghost witch. The Native American myth goes that she finds a nesting place, and feeds on the blood of humans. And if you're lucky, she would just feed on you and leave you to die. But if not, she will feed on you until you take the eternal walk, a walk into darkness for eternity. Sarah, I know you're hurting, and I know you want your husband back very bad. But there's usually no coming back from this type of thing. And if you get too close to the darkness, you will fall in. I don't care about darkness. I just need David. I need to know. There might be a way for me to find some answers, but it won't be easy. There's a sacred land, not too far from here. A place where I do my more dangerous sessions. If you can meet me there tomorrow night, I might be able to find some answers. Okay. Do you have a pen? Oh, yeah. Meet me at this address, and bring something very personal that belonged to your husband. Like a shirt? Something that he touched almost every day. Before you go... Before you go, watch this tonight, if you can. Sorry for the old tech. Thank you. Okay, dusted off the VCR, picked this up. This is the tape that Benny gave us. Since the beginning of time, witches have appeared in myths of cultures from all over the world, including the Native Americans. These horrific beings originated in the legends of several tribes in the southern United States, more specifically, Texas. The more well-known myth is that of the Skadegamutc, also known as a ghost witch. A kind of ancient, evil shaman who refuses to stay dead. The undead shaman comes alive at night and stalks the land for unsuspecting victims. The only way to maintain their immortality is to feed on the blood and flesh of humans. One of the more lesser known variants of the ghost witch goes by the name the Red Sister, due to her eternal lust for blood. According to legends, the only way to destroy the Red Sister is to- We're out here in the middle of nowhere, trying to find this sacred land. Do you trust this guy? Yeah, I trust him. I think he means well. Let's begin. Did you bring the personal item with you that I asked you? Yes. This rock is from the fire from the center of the universe. The seed that flew into the womb of great mother. Sarah. Sarah. David! Run! Go, go, go, go! Benny! Benny! Benny, Benny, get in! Benny, Benny, Benny, Benny! Get off of me! David. David, it's Sarah, baby. David, I just need to know where you are. Can you hear me? David, I need you. I'm just gonna to need some time, okay? I'll call you when I'm better. Deep in south Texas sits one of the most haunted locations in the United States, the Yorktown Memorial Hospital. The hospital was originally created by a Roman Catholic group, known as the Felician sisters in the 1950s. It was mainly used as a rehabilitation center for drug addicts and those fighting alcohol abuse. Many patients checked into Yorktown hospital, but many never checked out. It's estimated almost 2,000 people died inside the walls of the hospital, many from unknown causes. Following negative press from all the deaths, the hospital finally closed down in 1986 after losing funding. But the hospital remained standing. Today, Yorktown Memorial Hospital sits on private land, where numerous paranormal investigations have been performed, some capturing terrifying moments on film. Is it possible the tormented souls of almost 2,000 people still wander around the halls of Yorktown hospital? There have been many attempts by the people of the city to have the hospital torn down, but all have failed. The hospital still stands today, like a rotting corpse deep in the heart of Texas. Did you hear that? That's his voice. I'm 100 percent sure. Listen, I need to ask you just one favor. And then, I promise this will be done forever. We need to go back to Yorktown. I'll pay you double what we agreed. All you have to do is be there and film it. After that, I will be out of your life forever. I promise. It's almost 3 AM and the front door is open. It's five minutes till three. Sarah, what are we looking for? Sarah? It still says five minutes to three. But we've been here over an hour. Hello? Is someone screwing with us? Look over here, bunch of tapes, patient names. June García, John Davis. My name is on this tape. Now, you keep telling me that your husband is missing. But that's not quite true, is it? It is true. He's been missing. I have to find him. Sarah, you have never been married before. We have double checked all records. That's not true. Perhaps this man was just a lover you had. Are you a whore, Sarah? A woman of sin? Fuck you. Do you know where whores go? They go straight to hell. They suffer for all eternity in pain and darkness. Is that where you want to go? I'd rather be in hell than here. That's not me. Tell me that's not fucking me. Perhaps another round of electrotherapy will help clear your conscience. No. They told you to stay away from here, didn't they? It's 3 AM. David. David, it's me. David, I'm here. Are you in the hospital? Sarah, wait. Sarah? I'm here, David. David, please. David, I'm here. I did what you told me. David, David, I'm here. I did what you told me. I did everything you said, David. What the hell? It's okay, it's okay. We're just shooting a film. Giles? Giles? 10-33, requesting immediate backup! David, where are you? David, David, David! David, David? Over here! It's him. David? David, it's me. You called me and I came. You called me and I came. David? David, it's me. David? David. Why are you here? You called me. You called me on the radio. Leave now. We're here to take you home, David. David? She's coming. Who's coming? Soon. Who's coming, David? Cut the light! Come on, now. Come on, David, please, please. The door's open! Please, David, please. Please, David. David, David! We have to go. No, no, no, I am not going without my husband. I'm leaving, sorry. David, David! David! David! Let me go! No, no, no, no! David! You know, it's probably just some crackheads, I'm gonna be honest. You're probably right. Either way, I'm gonna get this one over with. Police department. Police department, let yourself be known. Jesus. Go, go, go. Watch that door. All right, I'm gonna check down this hallway. Circle back. Copy that. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Police department, if there's anyone in here, let yourself be known.
