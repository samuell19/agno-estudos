[girl] Where did you get the name Zelly? [Zelly] Zelly comes from Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle means "Miss" in French. [girl] Oh! Made-moi-zelle... Made-moi-Zelly! Why do we have souls? [Zelly] When God made each of us separate, he took pity on us and gave us souls to be in. [girl] Like a little boat? [Zelly] Yes. Like a little boat. [children chattering] [whispering] I have something to show you. You can hold her if you want. Where did you get her dress? She came with it on. I'm getting one just like it when I get married. You're so lucky. I'm going to have a wide satin sash tied with a bow in the back. And I'm going to have a wreath of flowers on my head. Can I be your bridesmaid? Would you like to come over to my house and play tomorrow? I can't. Why not? If I come over to your house, my grandmother will be all alone. She has no one to play with but me. [girl] Hi. -Hi, Kits. -Hi, Kitty. Hi. Will you sit next to me on the bus? -Okay. -Come on! Phoebe, please find a seat. Matt, give Phoebe a seat. [children chattering] Hi. Who's that? Joan of Arc. She was burned. She was? When she was eight years old, an angel came to her in the fields. He was very tall with big wings and a fiery sword. He told her his name was Michael, and that he'd been sent by God to prepare Joan for an extraordinary life. [laughs] [Phoebe] Why was Joan of Arc burned? [Zelly] The judges wanted her to say she didn't hear her voices. [Phoebe] What were her voices? [Zelly] No one really knows. I believe they were the sound of herself. [Phoebe] Do you have voices? [Zelly] If I listen very carefully, I have a voice. [Phoebe] Where does my voice come from? [Zelly] Your soul. [boy] There's the eagle house! [dog barking] [Phoebe] If you get married, you have to promise to take me with you. [Zelly] But where would I meet my man? [Phoebe] Promise? [Zelly] I promise. [children chattering] Does Phoebe's nursie change her diapers? Get lost! [girl] Stop it, David. Leave her alone. Give me back my record! Over here, David! Over here, yeah! [David] Catch it! Pass! Pass! [bus driver] David! Sit down! Does Fweebie want her mommy and daddy? My mother is dead, my father is dead, and I wish you were dead, too! Now get off me! Poor little Fweebie. [bus driver] You guys want a trip to the principal's office? [boy] Look at her! Oh! [Zelly] What's the matter, cabbage? Why are you so sad? [Phoebe] Do you have to go on your day off? Mon chou! Mon chou! Why did the chicken cross the road, mon chou? -To get to the other side! -Mon chou. I hate David. He almost broke my Joan. Are you still mon chou? I am your cabbage. Are you still my jelly belly? I am your jelly belly! Do you have to go on your day off? Can't you stay home just this once? I'm only leaving after tea. And I'll be home in time to tuck you in to bed. Do be sweet to your old Zelly. And hurry at tea. I want to leave exactly at 4:00. Do you and Joan come from the same town? No. Joan comes from Arc. And I come from Lyon. [dog barking] Max! Max, don't chase those chickens! Do you know why the chicken crossed the road? To lay an egg. No, silly, to get to the other side. [gasps] [hedge trimmer whirring] Oh! [laughs] Hi, how are you doing? Good. Hi. Hi. What? Oh, I bet you think I have something for you, don't you? No? What about this pocket? No, no. It's not in there. Maybe it's in my back pocket. No? What about that pocket there? No? Ah, there it is, right... there. Take it. Has your wife had her baby yet? No, not yet, but you know, every time the phone rings, I wait for Nora to come to the kitchen door and say, "Earl! Your wee one's come!" [laughs] [woman] Tea time! [Earl] Oh. Better go off to tea. Oh! Thank you. -Bye-bye. -Thanks, bye. [Phoebe] Why don't Earl and his wife live together? [Zelly] Earl is saving money so his family can come live with him. Hi, Nora. Hello, Miss Phoebe. [Zelly] Phoebe? You know you're not supposed to go in there. [Phoebe] Hello, Waddles. [kisses] Queenie? Queenie? What are you doing in there, Queenie? Hello, Miss Queenie. -Come to me, pet. -Hello, Co-Co. There's a surprise for you at tea. Really? What is it? Wait-and-see pudding with guess-what sauce. What are you doing? Well, I'm taking the Japanese beetles off the roses. Why? Well, the beetles eat the roses. The beetles are bad. Poor beetles. Where do they come from? Well, all gardens have beetles. We didn't have beetles in our garden at home. This is your home now. [Nora] Madame, the tea's getting cold! [Co-Co] Come along. Let's go to tea. [Phoebe] Hurry, Co-Co says there's a surprise for me at tea. Une minute, s'il te plait. Cherie... Can I wash Waddles? I wouldn't let any soap get in to his eyes. Then we could put him out in the sun to dry. He'll be so handsome when he's clean. No, Zelly, his stuffing will fall out, and he'll die. Phoebe. Look. Is this for me? It's so beautiful. Look, Zelly. Oh, oui. C'est adorable. Thank you. Well. Look, Queenie. Look, Waddles. Is this for me, too? No, Phoebe. Those are my best tea napkins. My mother embroidered them herself. Oh. -Did you see, Nora? -Ah, yes. Who lives in the house with the eagles on the gates, Co-Co? Phoebe, don't speak with your mouth full. [Co-Co] You've heard of Alexander and Alexander Baby Products? Well, the grandson inherited it all. He rattles around that house all by himself. No wife, no children. [Phoebe making slurping sounds] Does the young lady take one lump or two? Her name is Queenie. Does Queenie take one lump or two? [Phoebe] Eight. One. Too much sugar is bad for your tusks. Have I met Queenie before? [Zelly] Madame, I found her in a window. She was half price. One eye was dangling down her cheek. Oh, she needed a good mother, madame. Where is Teddy? I gave you Teddy. [imitating siren] Phoebe! All right, cherie. Teddy's upstairs. Teddy's skirt is too pretty to play outside. Where did you get Waddles? I've had Waddles for as long as I can remember. Mommy made his pompom. [making kissing sounds] I think Waddles is in love with Queenie. [Earl] Max! Get back here! -[Phoebe] Max! Nice! -[Co-Co] Bad dog! -Max! -[Co-Co] Give it here! Bad dog! My best game rooster. Max-- [Phoebe] What are you doing, Co-Co? -He didn't mean it! -Madame. Stop, Co-Co, you're hurting Max! Phoebe! When the chicken rots, it'll drop off, -and Max will have learned his lesson. -[cries] [Co-Co] You have to break them by humiliating them first. Then they can be trained. [Max whining, barking] [crying] Earl? Don't you have to finish your hedges? [sobs] [crying] Mademoiselle was right. -Waddles is filthy. -[sobs] He needs a bath. But he'll die. Madame! Madame, I do Phoebe's wash tomorrow. -And I can put Waddles in the load. -Zelly! I wouldn't let any soap get in to his eyes. Do you want me to call the salvation army to come and get him? Now. Ammonia. Where's the ammonia? But, madame, the fumes of ammonia will make the child sick to her stomach. Mademoiselle! -[thud] -How dare you? Pick those up at once! You won't be allowed to touch Waddles until you say you're sorry for knocking my glasses off! But I didn't mean to. [sniffling] I want my mommy and daddy. -[Zelly] Sorry I'm late. -What's this? I'm leaving. What happened? She washed Waddles in ammonia. What? She treats her like a dog. What have you got in this? She tries to humiliate her and break her so she can train her. It's just awful. -Poor Phoebe. -Oh. Where are you going? I don't know. You ought to take Phoebe with you. I should, shouldn't I? I'll be put in jail for kidnappings. I should get another job. That's what I should do, I should get another job, right away. But it isn't easy. I don't know anybody in America but Mrs. Plainfield and you. I'm going to be missing our little meetings. Me, too. For me to be able to sit and talk to somebody like you... It's... chouette. You've got some chocolate here. Thank you. Is this your father's? Joan, I'm not who you think I am. I know. You don't have to explain to me anything. You're a very nice man, and I'm a very practical woman. Have you seen my sneakers? I like those shoes. Please stay. I'm too afraid of that woman. Then what about Phoebe? Phoebe? Phoebe's the closest thing I'll ever have to a child of my own. Well... What about... What? Stay for me. Joan, wait! Good night! Oh, zut. [knocks] Who is it? Phoebe. Come in. Waddles has mildew. Can I take him down from the line? I would like to say I'm sorry. I am sorry. I'm sorry I knocked your glasses off. I didn't mean to. Get down on your knees. No! Leave, then. "I am sorry, Co-Co, for what I've done." Say it. I am sorry, Co-Co, for what I did. "Please, forgive me." Please, forgive me. "I am a very willful and selfish girl." "I do not think of Mademoiselle or my Co-Co. I think only of myself." I am a very willful and selfish girl. I do not think of Mademoiselle or my Co-Co. I think only of myself. When you get older, you will understand that it's my duty to break this terrible willfulness. It's for your own good. And, Phoebe... Everything that we've said today is just for you and your Co-Co. You must never tell anyone. Do you understand, Phoebe? Yes, Co-Co. Can I get Waddles down now? Yes. I forgive you. [hairdryer whirring] Boom, boom, boom. [making kissing sounds] -What's the matter, Phoebe? -Nothing. If you put your nightie on and brush your teeth, we can listen to the next chapter of Joan together. [narrator] The angel Michael-- Joan triumphs at Rouen-- alone in the cell-- the judges ask Joan about her voices-- The fourth groove. Why was Joan burned? The judges wanted her to say she didn't hear any voices. What were her voices? Nobody really knows. I believe they were the sounds of herself. Don't go in there! I told you not to go in there! Teddy did what I told her not to. She was willful and selfish, and so she had to drown. Poor Teddy. You know, I don't think Teddy's dead. Why don't you say to Teddy that you're sorry? No. Phoebe. All Joan would have had to say... was "I never heard any voices." And they wouldn't have burned her. Uh-huh. So she just couldn't say something she didn't believe. That's right. I don't want a voice if it's going to make me die like Joan. Oh, Phoebe. Look at me, chou. Not everybody is asked to choose between their voice and their life. Was she afraid of being burned? Very afraid. I don't want to live in this world. Oh, chou. Phoebe. Did you and Co-Co have a talk? Phoebe. It's important that you tell me. Don't make me tell you. Phoebe. Phoebe. You'll feel better after you tell me. I had to kneel down and I had to say that I'm willful and selfish, and that I don't care about you or her otherwise I wouldn't have acted the way I did. And I said it. Mon chou. [Co-Co] Phoebe! -Phoebe! -[Phoebe] Coming! -Yes, Co-Co? -[Co-Co] What do you know about this? I had a funeral for the beetles. And then I buried them. But why did you have to use my mother's tea napkins? Because they were so pretty. Next time, pet, not my best napkins. Yes, Co-Co. I'm sorry. -[Zelly] Cacahuete. -Caca-what? -[Zelly] Peanut. Cacahuete. -Cacahuete.Peanut. [speaking French] Harry-who? Hey. String bean. I'd rather be a zucchini. Tieman. [making buzzing sound] [both making buzzing sounds] What else am I? Mmm... Tu es mon chou. I'm your cabbage? I hate cabbage. -[speaking French] -Your what? My heart. -Zelly? -Yes? Did you get married? Almost. He gave me this. -Is it real? -Yes. That must be worth a million dollars. Why didn't you marry him and go away with him? Who knows why things turn out the way they do? -Zelly? -Yes? I love you very much. Will you marry me? Mmm. [chuckles] You have such a gentle soul. You and I were meant for each other, weren't we? Do you want to have a baby of your own someday? Hmm. Well, then, to do that, you have to fall in love with a man and then get married. I have an idea. Let's say that Waddles is you and Queenie is me. And Waddles and Queenie could get married? -Waddles! Queenie! -[Earl laughing] Queenie! Waddles! [Co-Co] Phoebe! I was coming to tell you. Waddles and Queenie are getting married. There's going to be a wedding. Nobody told me they were engaged. Waddles just asked Queenie this morning. Will you come, Co-Co, please? Will you come? We'll see. Would you like to see what's inside this room? Oh, yes. This room is only for grown-ups. That's why I keep it locked. It used to be our room, your grandfather's and mine. And then it was your mother's... and your father's when they came to stay. And when you're a grown girl, it'll be your room. When someone dies in a plane crash, do they explode in mid-air, or do they fall through the sky and drown in the ocean? We don't know how they died. We never found them. I have something to show you. It was your mother's. Would you like to try it on? Yes. How do I look? This dress can be yours one day. Mine? And, a one, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. [inaudible] [door creaks] [imitating chicken] One more, ladies. That's all I need. Just one more. Thank you, Rosie. Do you think she'll be pleased, Nora? Oh. Oh, madam. -Do you? -Oh. -[phone rings] -Oh, yes. One moment, please. Oh. -[whistling] -[rooster crows] Earl! Earl! You've a wee boy! -A wee boy! -A boy. I got a boy. I got a boy! [laughing] One, two... Give it a jump. -Earl? -Yes? Oh. Thank you. Thank you. Mademoiselle? I made this wreath for you. Oh, merci,madame. Nora? Look. And here's a wreath for Queenie. Oh. And this one is for you. All I want is for you to be happy. Oh, Co-Co. There, there. That's enough. Everyone ready? [all] Yes. [trumpet voluntary plays] Dearly beloved, we are here today under the sight of almighty God to join this bear and this elephant in holy matrimony. Do you, Waddles and Queenie, take one another as your wedded spouse, to have and to hold from this day forward, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part? [Zelly] I do. [Phoebe] I do. [Earl] And now, may we have an exchanging of the rings? There are no rings. Will you lift the bride and groom, please? I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. [making kissing sounds] And now it's time for champagne and cupcakes. [Nora humming] [all laughing] [exclaiming] May St. Patrick and St. Bridget walk with you always! [Zelly] Isn't she a beautiful bride? -Oh, when did you make it? -Oh, Earl. A wee bed. Let me see. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in the whole world. It's for the honeymoon. [Earl laughing] Well, thank you. [kisses] [vocalizing] I'm so, so, so hangover. I won't be able to go to school tomorrow. [Zelly] Ho! So don't! [both laughing] [Co-Co] Well. Shall we have dinner? May I please have some more champagne? Phoebe, sit up straight. I thought we were having fish and tomatoes. It's fish. Madame, with the wedding, I forgot to talk to Earl about driving me to the village tomorrow. You're always going on your day off. You can call a taxi in the morning. Very well. After dinner, I'll tell Earl that I take a taxi. Earl has left. He left? Yes. Just now. For what? He's gone home. When will he come back? He's not coming back. He's not coming back? He left like that without saying good-bye? [vehicle departs] Phoebe. Earl! Earl! Mon chou. [Co-Co] Phoebe! Come back to the table right now! Phoebe, Earl said for me to give this to you. [sniffles] But why did he leave without saying good-bye? I expect he was in a rush to see his baby. Then why didn't he leave this morning? It was time for Earl to leave. You fired him. He was the gardener. He was my friend. [Co-Co] Eat your fish, Phoebe. Do as I say! Apologize to me. No! I haven't done anything. I didn't mean to spill my lemonade. Go upstairs. Until you apologize to me, Mademoiselle, Nora, and I will not speak to you. I will break you of your willful ways if it's the last thing I do. [footsteps fading] Another piece of bread, Mademoiselle? No, thank you. [narrator] When Joan was eight years old, an angel came to her in the fields. He was very tall, with big wings and a fiery sword. He told her his name was Michael, and that he had been sent by God to prepare Joan for an extraordinary life-- He was very tall with... -Mademoiselle? -...big wings and a fiery sword. What are you doing? -I'm just getting the child ready to go to bed. -He told her his name was Michael... Phoebe is old enough to put herself to bed. ...by God to prepare Joan-- ...very tall with... That's enough of that machine. ...fiery sword. He told her his name was-- Break it. I can't do it. -Break it, I said! -It's Joan. Does no one in this house listen to what I say? I hate you! Leave the room, please. -[Co-Co] Mademoiselle? -[thunder rumbling] I must have a word with you. Yes, madame. Until Phoebe apologizes for what she has said, I think it best that we do not acknowledge her in any way. All Phoebe needs is your love. Mademoiselle, if you find it difficult to comply with my request, I would understand perfectly if you were unable to return from your day off. Yes, madame. Good night, Mademoiselle. Good night, madame. [door closes] [rain pattering] [thunder rumbling] [gasps] Mon dieu. She burned Teddy. -Chou. -Zelly, can I sleep in your bed tonight? [door opens] [door closes] Zelly, talk to me! Don't go on your day off! [children chattering] [Phoebe] Talk to me, Zelly. Please? Zelly? Talk to me. [hedge trimmer whirring] [Phoebe] Co-Co! Co-Co! [whirring stops] I got 100 on my math test. Co-Co? [whirring resumes] Co-Co, please! -Damn! -[whirring stops] [whirring resumes] I love you, Waddles. I love you, Waddles. Don't you love me anymore? Talk to me, Waddles! Talk to me! [vehicles passing] [Phoebe] Was she afraid of being burned? [Zelly] Very afraid. But I promised myself I wouldn't talk about Phoebe. -On the phone. -And... You look great. I got a new lipstick. That's it. It's called Rapture Red. Never wore red before. It is something. Is it too much? No. I'm thick through here. Oh. Oh, you're thick in through those cheekbones there. You've noticed, too. Joan, I got to tell you, it's hard not to notice something like that. But seriously, don't you think it balances out a little... to have stronger lips, it makes it better? Much. Let me ask you a question. How in the world did you get so beautiful? [crunching] I am sorry I said I hate you. Please forgive me. Say... "I love you, Co-Co." I love you, Co-Co. Again. I love you, Co-Co. Please, again. I love you, Co-Co. Kiss my hand. I forgive you. If Mademoiselle were to know what we said tonight, she would have to leave us. This is to be our special secret. Do you understand? Say, "Yes, Co-Co." Yes, Co-Co. Good night, Phoebe. Good night, Co-Co. [footsteps] [door closes] [striking match] Good night. Good night, Joan. Good night. Phoebe. Mommy. Mommy. Cabbage, it's me. I want my mommy and daddy. Phoebe. Phoebe! [knocks] -Who is it? -Mademoiselle. -Yes? -Excuse me, madame. We need to talk. Phoebe's not well. She took matches and burned herself. The burns aren't severe. A basic dressing will take care of it. But the child shouldn't have had matches. She took them from the dining room. So... She told you what happened in the dining room. I told her not to tell you or you would have to go. She didn't tell me anything. I'm not going to be blamed by Phoebe's nurse for her childish pranks. I have to ask you to leave. I'm not blaming you, madame. I don't want to hear anymore. Just pack up your belongings! I'll call a taxi to drive you to the station. Madame, whatever I have done to offend you, I apologize. I meant no harm. Please reconsider sending me away. Mademoiselle. Don't you see... how hard it is for me to let you go? You've kept me from being lonely. You've been... almost a friend. But now I have to think about the child. You must not tell her you are leaving, and after you've left, make no attempt whatsoever to try to contact her. If you do, I'll have to take those animals from her. Mrs. Plainfield... Phoebe is dying inside. You love her? Of course I do. Then why don't you show it to her? I do. I show it all the time. Why doesn't she show love to me? [sighs] She tries. You push her away. I do not. I do not. She can teach you. Teach me, Mademoiselle? Leave the room. [door closes] [opera music playing] [knocks on window] Joan. Hey, Joan. I'm sorry I came without calling. What happened? I got fired. Holy smokes. Come on in. Tell me what happened. I didn't mean to show up like this. I... I didn't know where else to go. I'm here. [sighs] Couldn't do a thing for Phoebe. I just had to leave her there like that. Willie, I am going to try to take Phoebe with me back to Lyon. Will you help us? Sure. [sighs] I'll do... what I can. Thank you. How about a cup of tea? Okay. Joan. Joan. Oh, c'est matin? Is it morning already? -No, no, no. You fell asleep while I was making you tea. -Oh. Joan, I've been thinking. I really want to go with you and Phoebe. Willie. Now, listen. Tomorrow morning, we'll go together and pick up Phoebe at her bus stop. You ask Phoebe if she wants to go with us. And if she does, we get a flight to Paris and get on that train to Lyon. Do you mean it? I sure do. But it can't work. It's too dangerous. No, no, no. If she wants to go, we're not doing anything wrong. Whatever happens, Phoebe has to know that we fought for her. I don't have anything to lose, but you... Why do you take such a risk? It's your cheekbones. I don't sleep with my cross on. Don't worry. Mommy is here. I love you. I'll always love you. I'll never leave you, so there's no need to worry. You can all go to sleep now. [phone rings] [sighs] The Alexander residence. Good morning. Oh, good morning, sir. Yes, sir. Okay, I'll have everything ready for you, sir. Good-bye. [sighs] [Co-Co] Phoebe, you'll have to be a big girl and get dressed by yourself this morning. And PDQ, or you'll be late for the bus. How you doing there, beautiful? Is everything all right? Yeah. I wanted to tell you... That was some business that I have to take care of. Can you do me up, please? And that means that you're going to have to go pick up Phoebe on your own. I called a cab. And I'll meet you at TWA ticket counter at 12:30, okay? That's okay. I adore you. Phoebe... Cherie. You're wearing my favorite shirt. Phoebe, you're angry at me for leaving you, aren't you? Where's the ribbon? [Zelly] What ribbon? Waddles and Queenie. Oh, no, chou. Is that what you think? She sent me away. But I didn't tell you the thing I wasn't supposed to tell you. I want you to come with me to Lyon. If you get into the taxi, we can talk about it. I have to go to school. [vehicle approaching] I'll take you to the school after we talk about it if you still want to. [softly] No. -Please, Phoebe. -No. -Please, Phoebe. Let me talk to you. -No. Listen to me, Phoebe. I'm going to go back to Lyon today, and I want you to come with me, if you want to. Whatever you decide, cherie, I'll always love you. You and me alone? No. Somebody else is coming. A man is paying for the tickets, the airplane tickets. A man? A very nice man. I think you would like him. What will Co-Co say? We cannot tell Co-Co. When she finds out, she'll be very upset. Yes, very angry, and she will try to get you back. Are those new high heels? Yes. Yes, they are. Do you want to try them on? And I think Co-Co is upset and angry all the time, because she doesn't have a voice. I think she loves me, and she needs me to love her even more. Look. [Zelly] They look very nice. Yes, Phoebe. Co-Co loves you. You know. Are we going to say good-bye to Nora and Max? No. We have to just go. Who's going to take care of Waddles and Queenie? Nora will. I want to go home. I understand, child. Driver, take us back to the house we just came from. No! I want to go all the way home. I want to be with you. Oh. Oh, cherie. Driver, never mind. Take us to the airport. Do you want to try my scarf on, too? And your cross. Then I'll be just like you. Oh, mon dieu.I left the cross. Driver, can you take us back to the house you picked me up? -It's the eagle house! -Mm-hmm. Look, Phoebe. That's his car. May I help you? I'm looking for Mr. Alexander. Yes, what can I do for you? Willie... [Mr. Alexander] Do you know this lady, Willie? [Sighs] Yes, sir, I do. Well, I'll leave the two of you be, then, Willie. Good day. Thank you, sir. I came to get my cross. Oh, Joan... I wa-- I wanted to tell-- I tried, but I couldn't do it. You and Phoebe go to Lyon. Oh. -No. -You can do it. Please. Listen, I love you. But don't you see? This is who I am. It wouldn't have mattered to me. Take it. This is her cross. Take it. Please take it. [engine turns over] Zelly? Are you still going to the airport? No. What about Lyon? Driver, keep on driving, please. I didn't listen to my voices, Phoebe. I hope you will forgive me someday. Please, don't take me back. But what else is there to do? Please, let me come with you. Where are you going? I don't know. Don't make me live without you. Driver... take us back to the house where we picked up the child. [Phoebe] No. No. That's my child, and there's the governess! Are you all right? I've been so worried. Did she hurt you? Stop! You're hurting her! You kidnapped my child! Did you pick the child up at the bus stop this morning, miss? Yes, I did, sir. [Co-Co] You see? Are you going to put her in jail? Mrs. Plainfield, you'll have to come to the station to press charges. Let's go. Zelly didn't kidnap me. Phoebe, you know what happens to little girls who run away. I wanted to go with Zelly. Phoebe, go inside! I wanted to run away. Mademoiselle was making me come back. Ask the taxi driver. You heard us talking. She made me come back. [officer] Is that true, Mr. Beck? Yeah, that's right. The nurse was trying to get the child to come home? [Mr. Beck] That's correct. [officer] Mrs. Plainfield, do you still want to go to the station? I'd like to ask you all if you'd be kind enough to leave us in peace now. Good day, Mrs. Plainfield. [Co-Co] Good day, officer. Miss. [Mr. Beck] You still want a ride in to town? Yes, thank you. Are you leaving now? I have to, mon chou. Thank you for being so brave. You saved me from going to jail. When will I see you again? I'll come at your wedding. That's so far away. I know. Whatever happens, I'm always with you, and you're always with me. You are my mother. And you're my child. [crying] [whimpers] Good-bye, Mrs. Plainfield. [Co-Co] Wrap all of the animals in cellophane and put them in the box. [Phoebe crying] No, not cellophane! They can't breathe! They'll die! Please! Not Waddles! I have to go check on the soup. Nora! If you want to save your animals, you have to get on your knees, and tell me that you love me more than you love Mademoiselle. I love Mademoiselle more than I love anyone in the whole world. You're a bad, ungrateful child. No, I'm not a bad child, Co-Co. I take you in to my house, I feed you, I educate you, I teach you manners, and you talk to me like this. Don't you understand? You're all I have in the world! Let go of me! I want to say good-bye to Waddles and Queenie! You're never to see those animals again or this room! -Now, this is your new room. -[cries] [sobs] [door closes] [sobs] [sobs, sniffles] It's just you and me, Sockie. Waddles and Queenie would be so proud of you. Do you want a ride, Sockie? Mm-hmm. Listen, Sockie. [Phoebe] Sometimes I think something special is going to happen to me. [Zelly] I feel it, too.
