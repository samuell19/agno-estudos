I know she died here. I heard the nurse. Finally your cop instincts are aroused. Do not want to talk about it? I will forget my belly. Died in the hospital three years ago, cancer Nothing original. The promises. Before dying, made me promise to stop all this, ask my retirement and I could not refuse. Wanted finally I know peace.

The flight of Hans Hartmann... Arrest in Chile founder of the Colony: Hans-Werner Hartmann... Nicknamed "The Ogre". Ex Nazi arrested after two decades of searching. He joined the Hitler Youth. Studied acoustics. Created the secret society La Colonia. Hartmann. Their last interview Strange recordings appeared in the rubble of the Colony What you did there ? He studied the voices Suffering Voices Our responsibility was correct, educate and purify... true suffering is the only way to be one with Divine Laura Bernheim, president of the ICC haunted him for 20 years.

In this photo next to Hartmann. Yes, is his son. Franz Hartmann. Calcined found his body, and all other adherents of the colony including children. But all this is over. The Nazis were in last, evil now lies elsewhere. But decided to fight to the end? What else I can do? Every day I ask same question. What do we have ? Can sit there if you want. COLONY Nazi sect in the country of Pinochet This the founding of La Colonia in 1961 Hartmann bought a farm, the Villa Bavaria, called La Colonia, which was destroyed by fire in 1980 former Nazis hiding Colonia leaders Pinochet have offered their knowledge acquired with Hitler Nazis constructed a state within a state in Chile CHARITABLE everyone thought that was a charity, was on statutes were homeless children, especially orphans 583 01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:49,451 Orphans in South America but also Caribbean But once entering La Colonia, no one get out. They experimented them How did the Jews die in concentration camps I gave pills I gave injections . had shoes with brands to recognize my fingerprints . There were 40 dogs trained to track fugitives Was almost impossible to escape TORTURE Colonia was a base for torturing dissidents from Pinochet Hartmann and his disciples were talking to detainees And in return, benefit from a complete immunity in Chile No doubt, during the dictatorship Colony served as an intermediary to enter illegal weapons, or move them to other locations present, but are in Chile, because they must be in other South American countries why not elsewhere in the World .
