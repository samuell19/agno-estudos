I gotta lock up, son. You looking for faith, forgiveness? I'm lookin' for the Bulls to cover the spread. Conor, Duffy's here. You better have his money. I got it. I'm gonna have it. What's the score? You're into Duffy for at least five grand. Who gave you an account? I laid six grand with the Barber to get me even. Chicago's down by four. I got Chicago gettin' eight. Less than a minute to go. Hang on! Just hang on. You didn't bet the Barber with my money, did you, O'Neill? You're not that stupid. Shut up, Duffy. In 18 seconds, you'll have your money. Oh, and he gets hammered, and it goes! Shit! Okay, if he makes both, it's eight. I push. I'm even. Flagrant foul. He shoots that first. - That's bullshit! - If he makes all three, you're screwed. Grab him! Get off of me! I'm first, O'Neill! You always pay me first! You wanna kick my ass? No one can kick my ass better than I can. Hey, Conor, it's Ticky! It's Ticky. It's Ticky! Conor! Yeah. Hey. Ticky. Did you bring money for the summons? What's that? Did you bring money to get me out? Damn, you got "zactly's" breath. "Zactly's breath"? Your breath smells zactly like your ass. Damn, that's nasty. Did you pay them? They said it was 580. I need the tickets. Which ones? You got two pair on the floor for Bulls-Rockets. I'm gonna hawk those myself. The game's not till 7:00. It's 5:00. What? Just tell me where they are. Shit. Come on. They're under the, uh, religious statue on my dresser. Wait, Ticky! You gotta get 1,200. Ticky, you gotta pay to get me out! I already did. Yeah? It's Ticky. Let me in. Ticky. Thank God. I really need that money. How much did you get for the tickets? Jesus! Hey, O'Neill. Remember me? He grabbed me outside the United Centre. Yeah, you're the Barber's son. Yeah. O'Neill, do you even remember making that phone call from Michael Pistone's wedding? Get off of me. You talked to me. You said, "This is O'Neill, number 55. What's my limit?" So I check 55, and I see you got six grand. So you put that six grand down on Milwaukee, and, of course, they tank. So now I gotta ask my old man about O'Neill on 55, and guess what he tells me. He tells me that guy died four months ago. Look, tell the Barber... You bet six grand on your dead father's account. I need some money right now! Here, I'll give you everything I got. All right. That's a start. Relax. Mm-hmm. Forty-seven dollars. All right, you owe 6,600. You pay me a grand a week until I say stop. That's ridiculous. 500. 750. Bring it to the barber shop. You don want me to come back here. I'm s... I... They grabbed me outside the United Centre! Excuse me. I'm Conor O'Neill. I got an 11:30 with James Fleming. Can you lend me... 12 grand? - What, do you need to bury your father again? - What? Did you dig the guy up or something? What are you, freakin' sick? I'm sick? Four months ago you come in here crying... about how you need $5,000 to bury your old man. I talked to Mahoney at Mikey's wedding. It seems he also gave you 5,000 to bury the guy. And I'm gonna pay Mahoney back. I don't give a shit how much you owe Mahoney. Listen, Jimmy, I'm really up against it right now with Duffy... And I really don't give a shit how much you owe the bookies. Conor. Come back in here. You know, this... Just might help you. Jimmy, this is only 500 bucks. I know. You're going to coach a kids' baseball team with me. Jimmy, I don't think you understand how serious my situation is. I'm gonna pay you $500 a week for the next ten weeks. That's week one. Jimmy, I ain't no good with kids. You know, Conor, I do this to give something back to the community. You don't want to do it, give me the check back. Uh, okay. - So, I'll see you at the field tomorrow, 3:30. - Where is it? Right behind that Baptist church where you used to buy reefer. No, Jimmy, the only thing behind that church is those shitty housing projects.

Are you the Kekambas? Yeah, bitch, we the Kekambas. So, what's up? Where's James Fleming from Smyth and Stevens Securities? He's out of town on business. I'm assisting. What do you got... six or seven kids? If you can't field a team, the league'll drop ya. I'll, uh, tell Coach Fleming... This is Darryl Mackey. He's president of the league. Last year was a mess. We had to cancel games because we'd show up, and the other team would have five kids. Waste of everybody's time. We're just trying to save everyone a whole lot of trouble, okay? If you can't field a nine-man team, why don't you and the Kekambas go home? Talk to Jimmy Fleming at Smyth and Stevens Securities... and submit a roster by Friday. Friday. Friday. All right? Yo, Coach. Kofi and Ray Ray want to play. Is that Kofi Evans and, uh, Raymont Bennet? Yeah, Coach, but Miss Wilkes ain't gonna let them play. - - Wait, hey, hey! Who's Miss Wilkes? She teaches Saint Malachy. She gets on my damn nerves, I swear to God! - She is real mean, Coach. - She's an old nasty lady. She tell your moms every little thing. Do you know she called my house every night last year? - Every night! - She won't let these guys play? Hell, no! Coach, she telled they moms that they couldn't play ball until they do these book reports. - I can tell you anyway though, Kofi ain't doin' shit. - Ray Ray neither, yo. Them little suckers is like, "Bitch, quit that noise." Hey, hey, hey! Can we cool it with the "bitches"? ♪ Aw, shit, man. Coach, it's gettin' kinda late. We gotta go soon. We practicin' today?

Learned it from my cousin who was in Japan in the army. Lightning quick! This is the tiger. No man can defend himself from the fury of a well-trained karate tiger man. Yeah, Dre... a tiger. Okay. I only use the tiger when I'm fightin', like, a dozen guys. More than that, I use the bear. What's the bear again? I can't show you! Man, that's the secret code of the karate honor. Hey, wait up! Yes? Sister Wilkes? I'm Conor O'Neill. I wanted to talk to you about... Oh! I'm sorry. It's okay. It's just my head. Who are you here to see? Sister Wilkes. I'm Miss Wilkes. Do you teach here? Yes. Oh, I'm sorry. I was just expecting, uh... older woman. Oh, well, I'm not a nun. Thank God! I mean, that's great. Is Kofi Evans and Raymont Bennet in your class? Are they in my class. Yes, they're in my class. I need them to play baseball for the Kekambas. Oh, yeah. I think that's something you really should take up with their mothers. But the kids told me... Both mothers agreed the boys need to read one book... before they start playing baseball in the spring. Hey, I got no problem with that. You know, I think reading's real good for kids. You work for Smyth and Stevens Securities? Yes. - What deal did you blow? - What? Well, I'm sure you're not coaching this team by choice. My associate, James Fleming, is in New York for three weeks, so I, uh... I volunteered to help out. I... I would have loved to have coached that team. I was away on business... Canada... The day Mr Smyth and Mr Stevens chose the team, and... Canada. That must have been nice. Lovely. I was in the, uh, business part the whole time. Mm-hmm. Well, I think it's wonderful that you're teaching these boys to play baseball. I just think it's a shame no one spends any time helping them to read. Listen, I'm Conor. Elizabeth. I'm only helping out with the team for two weeks, but I'm willing to get together with you and help the boys out. Why don't we exchange numbers? I have a better idea. Why don't I give you... a copy of the book the boys are supposed to be reading, and you can read it. Then you can talk to Kofi and Raymont about their reports. God. That would be great. Conor O'Neill, coach of the crack babies. I can't coach that team. I've got to get out. I'm serious. I'm bailin' out. How'd it go with the nuns? God, she was beautiful. - Wh-Wh... You picked up a nun? - Ticky, shut up. You still want your half of the Blackhawks seats I got? Yeah. Where are they? I'm gettin' them tomorrow. Bring 'em to the baseball field on Loomis tomorrow between 4:00 and 5:00. Loomis? That's the friggin' projects! Hey. Don't screw me, Ticky. I'm not in the mood right now, all right? I need that money. I'll be there at 5:00. Before 5:00. O'Neill. Easy, slugger. All right? Relax. You got some cabbage for me? Can we talk outside, without the bat? Duffy, you knew my dad. And I wouldn't be callin' in a favor if I wasn't completely racked. You smashed up my bar. You kn that I'll pay it all back. I just need time. It ain't my money. Now, I can't carry you any more. I'll help with the book. Take bets. I'll bring in business. Nah. No, that's not gonna work. Listen, I gave them your name because I couldn't carry you. What? Are you telling me that some jag-off goombah is gonna come and break my thumbs? Duffy, I'm desperate. I'm coaching a kids' baseball team in the projects... for a guy who's paying me 500 a week. But I'm paying the Barber off. What should I do? Should I tell the Barber to back off? Should I start paying you every week?

Fool, I called you at Smyth and Stevens, and at first, some little girl didn't even know who you were. Then some man named Fleming got on the phone and told me you were out of the office today. - Please, take my home number. - You can't keep them boys out there after dark. Thank Jesus for Jefferson's strength. That smell? That might be a lawsuit. Look at you. You don't even look like you're holdin' it together. Jefferson, I'm sorry. I shoulda called practice, you know, when it got dark. I just came by because, uh, as soon as you're ready we expect you back, huh? And, uh, I needed to know, uh, what number uniform you wanted. You're never gonna stay being our coach. Enjoy the game. Hey. Nice wheels, soccer mom. Up yours. What's with the wagon? The suits at Smyth and Stevens took shit from one of the kids got beat up after practice, so they lent me this car to get 'em all home. Ah, man. Who got beat up? Who needs tickets? Jefferson Tibbs. That's the fat kid, right? Yeah... How'd you know? You told me about every kid on the team. Aw, shit. I hate it when people mess with kids. Jesus. It's so wrong. How can I help you fellas?

"Four Spanish men with hiking boots had surrounded me close. "I could tell they were banditos because they had taco breath and they called me 'hombre.' "I spun around and hit the biggest one. I punched him in the gut. "And as he was falling, he grabbed my backpack. "I said, 'Stop, you banditos! I don't want to have to hit anyone else.' "But because they were Spanish, they didn't understand me. "Two more jumped me, and I hit one of them in his..." Between his legs. "My mouth banged on his head, and that was where I got my fat lip.

Michael Jordan's book. - Nice book, man. - Excellent choice. A strong piece of literature, a great read. - Yeah. - That's a biography. That's the real story of his life. This is fiction.

Kekambas. What? Kekambas? Kekambas. Ed, you got it? Got it. You're a strange kid, Kekambas. I'm interested to see what happens with you. O'Neill! Gino, get him. Aw, fuck this. Account 27. Kekambas. Yeah. What's the line on Chicago tomorrow night against Miami? Gimme Miami minus six. Twelve grand. Wait. Wait. I'll take Chicago and the six points. Yeah. Twelve thousand. Conor, hi. Hey. Let's eat. Okay. Why don't we sit? So... I wanted to talk to you. Yeah, I wanted to talk to you too. So, uh, do you want a drink? No. What's wrong? I come here all the time with the guys I work with. Look, I know you don't work at Smyth and Stevens. Look at you. I could tell right away you weren't a broker. What's that mean? Nothing. You just don't look like someone that works at Smyth and Stevens. You look like a freakin' boring schoolteacher. Hey. Elizabeth! Elizabeth. Hey. Why'd you come here? To bust me in the lie about where I work? You win. You coach my kids. I thought we had a common interest. Elizabeth, I get paid under the table to coach that team. And I only do that because I'm in a big hole with two bookies who are lookin' to kill me. Yeah. What? Nothing. You know all this. I spoke to Jimmy Fleming after Jefferson got beat up. He told me. You just think I'm a big joke. No. It's people like me that make people like you feel better about your tiny life. This is unbelievable. I can't believe I came down here for this. Yeah? Then why did you come if you know I'm a liar? Because those kids trust you. And they don't trust anybody. I told you, I coach for money. Well, I teach for money. I've had some of the best fifth-graders in the world, but some of them don't make it because they don't have anybody besides their mother or me... telling them what to do. So what? I'm done with all that. Well, I just came down here... to see what they see, because they're never wrong. Take a good look. See what they see. I came to talk to you about a job. Yeah? Well, unless it pays 12 grand an hour, I'm not interested. Conor. Hey. Did you play it? Yeah. Twelve grand. Twelve grand? Yes! Coach! Can we have a word? How many points you givin'? I'm getting six. You took Chicago? Are you on crack? You laid 12 grand on those... Shut up, Ticky. I'm under a lot of pressure right now. - I said now! - Win or lose, I'm outta here. Darryl Mackey, league's president. We met. Coach, we're concerned about the age of some of the boys on your team. Can you produce birth certificates for your players? All I got is what Coach Fleming from Smyth and Stevens gave me. - Here they are. - What are the names of those two boys at second base? - Andre and Jamal. - Which one's Jamal? The taller one. This birth certificate's been altered. What? The eight's been turned into a nine. You have to be born after September of '88. Well, the kid is out of the league, and the Kekambas are on probation. Look, what are you guys? The cops? What's the point of the league, Coach? To teach kids it's okay to lie, as long as they can get away with it? It should be about these kids playing ball, not the trophy you bring to work. Look, the kid goes now. Okay? Jefferson bats seventh, plays first base. Miles pitches and bats eighth, and Clarence, you play third and bat ninth. Cool. Okay, let's go. Why I not playin'? You mad at me? Jamal, the other coach... 'Cause I'm sorry about pushing Ray Ray. I just want to play. Listen, they know that you changed your birth certificate. I can't let you play. But my mom said it was okay. She said that she would tell them if they asked if I was born later. She said it was okay. I just wanna play. There's nothin' I can do, Jamal. Look, why don't you just sit... Jamal! Miles, do your stuff now. Strike. Strike. Strike! Out. - Yeah, baby. That's what I'm talkin' about. - Time, Blue. I can't have this kid out here with these things on. What now? Coach, we're just all in agreement. The kid can't wear headphones while he pitches. Matt makes a good point about safety. - Come on. You're kidding me, right? - Think about it. What if he gets hurt because he can't hear in a dangerous situation? There's liability issues. Bring it in, fellas. Come on, bring it in. Bring it in. What are you doing? I want you guys to explain to them why they lost Jamal... and why Miles can't wear headphones, and why the Bua Was and the Waatas have nice uniforms, and we have shitty T-shirts. Easy, Coach. You're already on a warning. Kekambas. This is the president... and that is the coach of the goofiest team in the league. And they kicked Jamal off the team because he was born two weeks early, and now they're makin' Miles take his headphones off... 'cause he's pitching too good. It's a safety issue. Look, fellas. Fellas, you have to understand that everyone has to follow the same rules. That's some weak-ass bullshit, you bitch-ass, mother-freakin' bustas. What did you say? I believe he said, "That is some weak-ass bullshit." - Was that it, G-Baby? - Yeah, that's it. You are on thin ice, pal! I could have you removed from this league. - This is my last game. - What? I quit. What? I'm out. I got business out of town. All right, listen up. Kekambas, back on the field. Son, no headphones. Coaches, get back to the dugouts. Come on, let's go. Get out there. Come on! Let's go! What'd you expect? I was gonna coach this team the whole year? Baddy, Baddy, the pitcher's name is Baddy! Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof! All right, Calvin. Big stick now. Let's go. What have you got, son? What have you got? Bua Was! Hang on. You guys suck. Whatever. I just quit. Finally. I'll see you at the game. Yeah. Sluggers. Yeah. Next practice is Saturday, right? 11:00. Someone's gonna be here. Right? I'll make sure someone's here on Saturday for practice. Coach, can't you at least give us a ride? I mean... It's early. You can walk. You think you could drop us off? Don't you think... I might have something more important to do than worry about you guys... and your stupid little baseball team? Can we please go in now? I gotta take a piss. We're gonna watch the whole game through the glass? I feel better out here. All right. Jones fires. Oh! Shit! Shit! Jones is ice-cold! It's all right. Fourth quarter, we're up by two points, you're getting six. I don't know what I'm gonna do, Ticky. Come on. Hey. You're up right now. Ride it out. Ride it out. Nice play by Tillman. He's got it. Come on, come on. Here we go. Smith throws up a prayer. It's good! Holy shit! - Should I look? - No, no! You're not looking. It's working. Keep not looking. Oh, God, Ticky. Ticky, am I out of the woods? Here we go. Miami in-bounds. Don't foul! Don't foul! - Shit! They fouled him! - Williams will shoot two! Oh, God, Ticky. Never again. Never again. Shit! What's happening? Talk to me! What's happening? Williams at the line. - Williams makes the first. - Shit, shit! - If he makes the second, it's over, you're dead. - Williams shoots 80%. Williams shoots. It's in. Shit. What am I gonna do, Tick? Miami by seven. What am I gonna do? Oh, my God, Ticky. I was down 11 grand before I made this bet. Smith dribbles inside, half-court. Heaves a 30-footer! It's in! You covered! Yes, it's good! Are you sure? What's the final score? Miami by four! You covered! You covered 12 G's! I covered!

Let's go, let's go, let's go. Chicago landers brace for the long awaited inter-league, cross-town match-up between the Sox and the Cubbies tonight at Comiskey. In a battle between two of the brightest young hurlers in the game today, 21-year-old Jon Garland will face off... It's Ticky. Yeah? I'm alone, I promise. I'll take off my crusty underwear and stand naked in your hallway to prove it. I'm naked now. Beautiful. Come on. I'm gonna lay on the ground and slide my nuts under your door until you let me in. What's up? I paid Duffy. We're square. Did you call Fink? Are we down on the Bulls? How many points we gettin'? Fink wants to see that I've still got his money. Great. Let's go by there, flash him a little cash and bet the 12 grand like we said. What's with you? We're gonna do this, right? Yeah, okay. I just gotta go by the baseball field. Jesus Christ. I thought you quit. I did quit! I gotta drop the equipment off, right? I don't know. ...match-up between the Sox tonight at Comiskey. Sammy Sosa will attempt to go yard for his fifth consecutive game... and the big Hurt will attempt to break out of his dreadful 11-game hitting slump. We're just over an hour away from game time. We'll be back to take your calls. All right. See ya. Hurry up, okay? - You here to tell us you quit? - That's old news. I left a message for Coach Jimmy that I was just gonna drop off the equipment today. He should be here any minute. - Yeah. Keep goin', sucker. - We goin' to the 'ship by ourselves. I can't bet the 12 grand. Fine. I understand. We should just bet six grand and wait till we got a little breathing room... No, I can't. You get your bummy ass outta here, 'cause we a better team without you anyway. Ha! Ha! Ha-ha! I'm not listening to any of you. I'm not listening to you. I'm not listening to you or any of you! So good luck. Good luck on your own. Call me when you get to the 'ship without me. Cold. Good luck. I'm so glad I'm done with this. Can we please go? If Fink thinks we're coming, we should at least stop by. If we don't want to bet it, we don't count. Technically... How many of you guys been to a big league park and seen a baseball game? No. Uh-uh. Ha! Ha, ha, ha! That's what I thought. You guys will never be a team until you see it played right. Never! Gimme that. Listen, you're stressed out. Let's grab a bite. We can call Fink and lay the bet. Head for... I'm out, Ticky! You hear me? I'm out! I'm out, I'm out, I'm out! Okay? I'm out! Okay. Okay. You're out. I'm done. I'm done with all that. Well... you gotta call Fink for me. You can't just dissolve a partnership like that. I-I-I'm flapping in the breeze here. Seriously. I got nothin' now. I'm flappin' in the breeze here. Kekambas. Come on. Let's go. Get in the car. Game starts in an hour. Come on. Let's go. What's this? What are we doing? What is happening here? Hey, let's... Let's bet three grand. Three grand will be fine.

I wanted to apologize for the other night. Well, I have had better dates. Yeah. I'm sorry. I heard about the baseball game. The boys loved it. Yeah. It worked. We've won three in a row since then. Do you have any idea how much that meant to them? I was thinking... how the other night you knew that I wasn't really a stock trader... and that I had a big gambling debt. And if you were there to offer me a job, it might still stand. So you're not here to ask me out? Uh, no. Okay. Am I supposed to be? Uh... - We need a physical activities coordinator. - You and me? The school. You know, someone to supervise after school recess, organize games and sports. We'd really like to get a guy because... I think you like me. What? I just got this gut feeling that when you were laughing at me, that you like me. Are you interested? In the job? What are we talking about here? I'm, uh, interested. I'm interested... I'm interested in anything I'm supposed to be interested in. Okay. Okay. Let's go, Bua Was! What's everybody lookin' at? Why we gotta play them damn boo woos again, man? They kicked our ass. 'Cause the two best records in Division A play to see who goes to the 'ship. If we win this, we go to the 'ship. If we win. Everybody sit down. Take a seat. Come on, Dre. No matter what happens today, you guys should be really proud of the season you've had, 'cause you played like a team. And because you played like a team, I thought you should look like a team. Jefferson Albert Tibbs, I believe this is yours. Man, that shit is tight! Look at that, boy! Fellas. There's no more shirts in the box. Nope. G-Baby. Yeah! What is destiny? Destiny is you're supposed to win. Since you're supposed to win, since I expect you to win, I don't want any celebrating when you strike out one of these ridiculous... Hey, dogs, hats!

I wanted to give a few more people the opportunity to say something on... On Jarius' behalf. Please, Mr O'Neill. Come on up. Good morning. Jarius was a player... on the Kekambas baseball team that I coach. Honestly, he, uh... He was too young to play. But he wanted to be a part of the team so badly that, uh... I couldn't say no. G-Baby. You're up. He had a great smile too. I know I'm not telling you anything you don't know. I've got Jarius Evans batting for Jefferson Tibbs. He was a really tough guy. Just a boy, really, who, uh... wanted to be around his older brother. Hang on, Coach. I don't have Jarius Evans on this roster anywhere. Oh, you know what? There he is. He's okay. The other day... we played a really important game against a good team. And, two outs in the last inning... G-Baby. ...I had no choice but to let Jarius bat. You can swing if you want, but you don't have to. Okay. If you go down looking, none of us care. But if you want to swing, swing. Get back in there. Do what you feel. Okay. He was fearless as he stepped to the plate. I was terrified for him. With two strikes and our hopes dwindling... he hit a shot down the first baseline. We won the game. And watching him... raise his arms in triumph... as he ran to first base, I swear... I was lifted in that moment to a better place. I swear he, uh... He lifted the world in that moment. He made me a... better person... even if just for that moment. I am, uh... forever grateful to Jarius for that. That was nice, what you said. His mother was very moved. Thank you. Wait. There's some people who want to talk to you about the baseball team. The team is done. That's what they want to talk to you about. They're in the auditorium. We know the league wants to cancel the championship game. Mom said it was all up to us 'cause of G-Baby. Yeah. It's over. You guys don't have to play. You guys had a great year. You can keep the uniforms. - Wait. You're quitting again? - What do you mean? We wanna play, bitch. Yeah, man. - You guys wanna play? - Hell, yeah! For G-Baby. I'll see you tomorrow at 11:00. Hey. I came to make sure you guys win. I even made a bet with your friend, Ticky. Knowing Ticky bet against us improves our chances. Did you really fill out an application to work at the school? Yeah. Good luck today. Thank you. Andre and Ray Ray. What's up, Coach? Why don't you bring everybody in? Hey, y'all, bring it in. Bring it in! Y'all, let's go. I want you guys to take a good look at yourselves today and feel proud. You made it here. We're here. What I've learned from you is that... really, one of the most important things in life... is showing up. I'm blown away by your ability to show up... through everything that's gone on. The league never wanted you to play this game. But you showed up. But, uh, we only have eight players, so... God. ...we can't play. He was my brother. He loved to watch us play. He's watching us right now. We gon' play today. Here you go, Kofi. - Okay, this is for G-Baby. - G-Baby. G. For G. G. Play ball!
