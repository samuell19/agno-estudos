Awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival. I swear. What about, Kadir? I will leave this land where I die for a drop of water. - Where will you go? - I will emigrate to France. - What about your grandparents' grave? - I give them to you. - What about your children? - I'll leave them too. - What about your lands? - Damnit! I will enroll in the army. - Are you crazy? - What about your family? It's all over. All the land? All our people? This miserable land, I'm leaving it. Be patient, Kadir, my son. God will help us next year. God is not helping us, he is just watching! Calm down, we've seen worse. Yes, but these lands will always be barren. I'm sick of hunger...of poverty. I'm sick of misery. I'm sick of everything! What about your family, Kadir? I am going into exile for them. Wake up now... Our situation is desperate. Remember this and never forget: Your turn will come one day...

If the drought continues, the whole herd will die. We must pray for help. ASHES YEARS If it does't rain tomorrow, tt will be a bleak year as usual. You have done your duty, my children. You can go home. Now this depends on the will of Allah. Give us some water! Hey, Boulakhras! Where did you find the water? From Sid Emberek's Creek. It's almost entirely muddy. Hurry, only a puddle remains. That means a day of walking! Have you heard? Thunder is coming from Sellat! If it comes from there, it means it will rain tomorrow. Water is coming! What are you waiting for? Aysa is waiting, she will let us know. I can feel it from here! Aysa, is there a trace of water? I am waiting. Let's listen. This is water, I hear! Get up. Enough of this nonsense. Are you playing the Indian explorer? Look! All the water is going their way! Our side is silted up. We should clean our canal! This dam is separating us! All the water is flowing to your side! It's not our fault. It's the divine will. Divine judgment cannot be unjust! We deserve a share. If you touch this water, you will regret it! What have we got to lose, you despots? What happened, aunt? are you okay? Ahmed, I came to talk about a marriage proposal... I don't understand. Kheira is your sister. Ali is your cousin. Do you understand? It's always the same drought. Always the same story. Like every year. Follow me! Pack your things! Said, talk to your cousin. Ahmed, be as patient as we are. Are you crazy? Are you leaving? Yes! - Your village? - I don't know. Your land? The graves of your ancestors? All yours. - And their fate? - It's over for all of us. Ahmed, I beg you, stay! Calm down! I ask for your blessing, Sheikh. What happened Ahmed, my son? I see that you are not alone. Your wife, kids... My departure will be for their good. You will cut the umbilical cord. Fate has already cut it. Are you sure? Yes, Sheikh. So, may the blessings of your ancestors and mine be with you. They will tell you where your cousins ​​live. Here they come... Please, where does Kadir Ben Amar live? Here they come, ragged and hungry... Where does Kadir Ben Amar live? More lost souls... Certain that they've found paradise... when actually they are sinking in the sand. The only resting places in this world... where one is safe from danger... is the cemetery! That's the only truth! The shepherd, who wanders constantly, looks for mirages. He thinks he has found the water of life as he sinks even deeper. Here is our mirage, the city. You will see that the water is bitter. They were free and unhappy! Now they are just unhappy! You're crazy! Yes I am mad! But I know where I live. Will you have a roof over your head tonight? Come on, follow me! Here's the city you wanted to find! Everything for sale. Here lives our ruler who despises us... and here is your chain. The absolute power of the Colonel... is exercised without fail... And there lives a man full of insults! The arrogant Caide, that threatens and oppresses us. The barracks! The police station! The church and cross! Their god protects them as they spy on us. You will see how adorable our city is! With the stubborness of your people, poor but proud, our paradise begins, built on misfortunes and sustained by constant suffering. Watch out for this "paradise"! How charming! There is neither tummy nor trachoma! Wipe your nose! Get out of here! Go die elsewhere too! Uncle Ahmed is here! - How was the harvest? - "Good," as always. He has his favourites. You! Come here! Where are you coming from? From the Abdullah Valley. You barking donkey! Come to your senses, shepherd. Forget your dignity, time is on your side. Have you seen? He's crazy. I pay you to work, not to sit around. Back to work! I don't work here. Go away! Get up, get up! Sleepers, get up... The time has come. Help our homeland, listen to its cries! Hitler's armies are pressing across the borders. You can't go too far, you're too young. Look how they run! If Amar comes, he will go to hell. Attention everyone! The Republic of France... has ordered a full mobilization. By order of the French President, all land, water and naval forces are summoned, all animals, vehicles and weapons are required. That Hitler! If he saves us from France, I... I will sacrifice a bull to him. I'll throw a party for him! Will someone hear us? Forget it! Play! Should I stop the game? Stop, like the Germans! "Motherland" gone bad! All french and natives subject to military service, under risk of punishment, must comply with this official order. What is he talking about? An order to get slaughtered! The masters of our masters are coming! I was not compelled before, and not now. I'll go, they're calling the reserve soldiers. I didn't know anything about military service. Then shut the fuck up! The army will implement this decree. Those who are here will inform those who are not. Get up everyone! We are called to this holy cause. Beggars, shepherds, the unemployed... Even your servant Miloud! Join me, I will lead you! Quickly! Mind your appearance. Take it easy. We'll be here all night! We will destroy Mulhouse, Salestat, and Strasbourg. Have you heard? This is it! We will fight on land, sea and air. If Churchill and his ilk continue, battlefields will be filled with their blood. This is our final warning. France is over. You are playing with fire! Churchill believes he will win. But fate has already decided. Anyone who rejects Hitler's outstretched hand chooses war! France refused! Now it's the guns that talk! Hitler destroyed them! He is invincible. Every soldier, full of old German military spirit, does his duty to the end. Don't worry. France is finished, our problems are over. You represent Greater Germany... Bravo, Yunus Bahril! As a Führer of the German people, I thank god... Awaken the dead! Who will lead the Germans to victory? They won, that's for sure! Long live the Führer and the Reich! Make no mistake! If by any chance this Hitler wins, He will destroy us before France: "Arabs are worse than frogs!" - Our troubles are over! - Hitler destroyed France! Hitler! France! Forget all this! I'm talking about a job! Are you kidding? Why would you play? I will tell you everything. Tell me now! Many young workers found jobs in the new work camps. You'll work tomorrow, I've arranged for it. Don't try to understand. It will cost you a chicken! Let it go, work! Rise up, city dwellers! Soon you will all be free! France has surrendered! Rise up, city dwellers! Soon you will all be free! France has surrendered! Young people... you will be the rebirth of our nation. France was taken and forced to its knees by traitors. Now, the one who saved you in the first battle, Marshal Petain, calls you to duty. Keep your head upright look to the future with hope, worthy of the given slogan: "Work, family, homeland". And don't forget the traditions you come from. Loyalty to your country, eternal, charitable, and pure. Go and rebuild the nation under his leadership. Give the Marshal your loyalty! Hocine fainted! From sunstroke! Remove that carcess, Caide is coming! Make way for Caide. You get up! CARD YEARS Can't you get up? I said get up! Aren't you ashamed of such a dirty identity? Step aside! You are an idiot! Forgive him, my cousin is an ignorant peasant. How many are you? Dez. Let's say 15. God bless you! Sunstroke. Water, hurry! Help! Another man fainted. This storm consumes them and purifies them forever... Scared doctors crawl around like vultures... The dead haven't been buried for three days... No sign of a living neighbor... They are all thrown into a common grave... Oh, how shameful and hurtful! Help them, my God! Deliver them from the fear that consumes them. Several fatal cases of typhoid have occurred. The colonel made his decision: The city is quarantined and other necessary precautions will be taken. French nationals wishing to be evacuated must inform the Military Headquarters. Immigrants have been warned not to violate the quarantine law. Where are you going? The city is isolated. You have been told this... over and over again... Colonel and Caide ordered you to stay at home. You are not allowed to leave the city. Go to your homes, wash yourselves with soap... Burn your old clothes and put on new ones... Cleanse yourself from germs. Whitewash your houses. Go to church now. All medicines are gone. Where are you going? To save my children. Leave them alone! I will take them to my city, where they can be saved. Free from hunger and far from misery and fear. Every day I will come to this sad world to talk to you... Shut up! People are dying and you are singing! I should strangle you! Who will bury them? Is your whole family sick? They no longer need it. Only God is eternal. Ahmed, my son... Throw away your despair and come back with us. One more year of hunger. As always, even in difficult times, our children have to work for the French colonists so your tribe will be able to survive. You should be with them. Americans! Why are they here? To help France. Hitler is killing the country! France! Hitler! Americans! What are they to us? We'll be here again at dawn so they can make money. Stop dreaming, they belong to the bosses! Don't push, everyone will get their share! Like animals! What a lot of water! This is how heaven should be! And we live in hell! We have paradise! God said, "Never forget why you are in this world." Everyone's gone. Only the dogs remained. Your animals drink water twice a day. This is not true. Your secret children! If you touch this water, blood will be spilled. If ours is spilled, yours will too! Cut it out! Lower your weapons! You have all gone crazy! They started it. Akli, calm down. Poverty, war, famine, colonialism not enough for you? What the colonists left us, do you need blood to run for a drop of dirty water? Aren't you ashamed? in the old days, we used to harvest a lot of wheat where the colonialists now live. Gardens, waters, fertile land... They took heaven and pushed us to hell. And for the remaining crumbs we are killing one another! The fight is there! Against those who stole our land, our water, our possessions. Turn your weapons against them! Do you want some water? It's easy. We only need five men from each tribe. - We know the way around it. - We'll do the same. Young people who want to be heroes! Here's what will happen to enemies of the system. THERE IS ONLY ONE PURPOSE: VICTORY YEARS OF THE EMBERS Don't bother searching nobody is left. What happened? A lot happened in May. Some brave men rose up against the French occupation. The soldiers came this morning and things happened... What about your friends? Dead, all of them. Don't bother searching. Your sister and aunt are waiting for you in the city. Name? Next! Some bravely gave their blood for this medal. All I have to do was bend over to stick it and hang it. What changed, soldier? You took it before and you threw it away now. Look, nothing has changed here, in this strange spring, overcrowded prisons, deserted villages... Follow me! Did you return alone? The darkness has arrived, with its troubles... Brave men have joined you and they are still alive, some were released, others are still in jail. Nothing has changed for the living! They are still lost sheep. But Caida and his masters are still robbing the people. Fear stalks the land and the brave have to be cautious. Very good. Congratulations! You are a real blacksmith. We'll get along very well. We have something to hope for! He's not from around here. Anyway, he came. See that stranger? So where did he go? Straight to the police station. Do you think he's plainclothes police? I can smell a rat! Akli always exaggerates, but this time he's right. He must be with the police. I don't believe it. An Algerian in their police force? I don't understand. That bus usually brings us lamb, the jackal brings snakes and vultures. But today it brought a predestined man! Here he is! Where is the hotel please? Can someone guide me? Miloud, take care of the deviants. Show him! Follow me! He is sleeping in the bathroom. He goes to the police in the morning. He snoops around town. He pretends to read the newspaper in the cafe. Isn't that suspicious? Cut it out. You are always imagining things. Or really. Mahmud is watching him. Your son is always with that madman! Why are you so late? Get going! Eat slowly! Are you going to the police again? - Something serious? - I have to show myself. Is it a report? Everyone on parole has to report every morning. Forgive us, we thought you were with the police. Don't be angry. Since May 8, there has been a massacre. I know. A dreadful ordeal for the people. That's why I was exiled here. So are you political? Praise be our faith! The Kur'an commands, "Obey Allah!" "Obey your prophet!" "And to those in power." Allah says: "For those who hold power..." Have faith! Ramadan is a time for contemplation and devotion to Allah. In our present condition, we live surrounded by infidels so that we witness how some of our brothers have left the way of Islam, and see how they indulge in drinking and carousing. We must increase our compassion and devotion, that we may protect ourselves from this decay. Tell the wicked: "You will be defeated and cast into hell." "You of despicable character." Don't forget the next verse: By the hill... By the book written on a scroll... Shame on you!' "Those who distort holy discourse..." Everything has a time for speaking and fighting. Muhammad is our Prophet. Praise be to him! That's what he did too. Son, I feel your kindness and faith. We warn you: public statements are prohibited. It's a good idea to keep your mouth closed. You and your policies! Who reported him? What did he do wrong? You're wrong, blacksmith. Our enemies know how to listen and think. But our ears are plugged and our minds are rusty. Get out, fool, or I'll crush you! Save your strength for work or go free your brother! Look! It's across the street. Walk It's just across the street. It's not that simple, Miloud. Only a madman like Miloud would dare to tear down walls. Any news? Nope. I watched it all night. And there he is! What happened? They beat him. Scoundrels! They are cursed! In the name of our martyrs, we call this meeting to order. First, let's deal with organization. Tell us about your connections with Si Hadj's group. They did not change their minds. One day they will see their own mistakes. Excuse me, I'm new. I don't understand why you agree with them. Our position is clear. Si Hadj's group believes negotiation with the colonizers is the only solution. We tried a few times to change their minds. Our experience and our history teaches that colonialism depends on the weakness of our resistance... They invade and destroy by force. This means there is only one way left: violence. The time for discussions is over. Our only hope lies in armed action. In summary: they came by force and they will be forcibly removed. This is why we disagree. Next, the question of weapons. Ahmed, who was responsible for armed action, collected some weapons. Abraham brought this, Yusuf this one. Weapons come from the black market. Do you expect that these will suffice in chasing the French away? Don't make me laugh. You're wrong, Akli. A person who aspires to freedom, forces fate to his will, makes darkness generate light, breaks his own chains. When tremors shake the world... and the world sheds its load... When a person asks himself what happened... that day the world will tell its own story... according to Allah's revelation. THE YEAR OF THE SLAUGHTER Our candidate will arrive tomorrow. As I said, tomorrow our party's candidate will sweep away the colonizers. We should welcome and assist him. Naturally, we count on your votes. But especially with your help we will defeat colonialism and elect the candidate of our freedom. Then good will triumph over injustice. The victory of freedom is for all of us. God bless you! As for help: in behalf of our comrades, he already has it. Until the elections: our help will not promote the victory of freedom. Shame on you, Si Larbi! A real militant like you says that? I do not want to believe that prison and suffering have made you so pessimistic! You are wrong. All our votes won't change anything. From all that happened, both in the past and in the future, it's just a scam. Heed my warning: If we follow this path, they will not take us seriously. We will become accomplices who endanger the future. In the name of the 8th of May martyrs, take back those words! They sow doubt in this difficult time. I say: in the name of the same martyrs We are helping colonialism! What will you do then? They came with a gun, they'll only leave with a gun. Why do you applaud? Do you know what that means? You little bird brain! Will you be a better judge than our leader in the capital? With all due respect to you, Si Larbi, your persistence on this road is fatal for movement, at this critical moment. We can't follow! What's up? Thank you for this reception. Mr. Mayor, how are you? I want to introduce my son. The cavalry! How can we avoid them? The shop is dirty, they won't come. Let's set aside our differences. This is an agitators' nest! They stir things up even in prayer. As for young people, if not for this jackal that is corrupting them, they will be with us. Come and talk to us. Do you understand? Everyone be at the meeting this evening. Don't tell me to lose! Right, greengrocer? As for you, I'll return you to Kabylla to pick olives! Begone, son of a bitch! Here's the bus! Here is Si Mohamed! - Will we win? - You bet! Your documents. Where are you staying? With my friend Si Hadj. Take your ID when you leave. Is there a problem? Everything is great. It's an understandable one. He is a reasonable man. He would not hold a public meeting. He doesn't want to make us angry. That is all. Your friends are waiting. If nothing goes wrong... you will get your documents when you leave. Hail Si Muhammad! Do you know him? He speaks well. You saw how the cops treated me! It is necessary to avoid their traps. Public meetings are prohibited. But together, we will fight them using their own weapons! We're all going to go to meet Bachaga. I will answer this. May the best win! You have nothing to win! Listen to this provocateur! Did you say Larbi? Great. Yes, I said it. But this is not a provocation. Come with us! I said you won't win anything. There is no need to talk to them, they are puppets anyway. You're wasting everyone's time. No one can say a battle is lost before it even happens. What battle? While they torment us weren't you howling at the rest of the pack? Of course, there will be a few sheep among the jackals. You are not talking to collaborators! It's the same thing! Larbi was tortured in prison. Who can understand the torture our comrade suffered? You're wasting your time. The people will choose. We will fight with the enemy's weapons and we will win! If people so desire, justice and freedom will triumph. With what, words? Listen! One day, you and your friends will be judged. If not for colonialism, you will be judged for history. I am a partisan, an activist. You know this. For the sake of the people we will follow the party's orders. We will go with our brothers and we will challenge the lackeys of France. Your future is with us, as administrator, with law and order, as in France. Every vote given to us is a vote for a bigger budget! It is a vote for prosperity! What's going on? This rabble will not make sense. They're cheering! They will put an end to Bachaga's rally! Let's take their leader. I have a better idea. France never forgets its needy children. On election day, vote for law and order! It's a trap! Come on, talk to them! We have been identified! Don't shoot! We are unarmed! We want to talk, don't shoot! You have been warned! It's the cavalry! Let's move to avoid their sabres! I warned you... oh, townspeople... what happened here - never forget! THE YEARS OF FIRE To the people of the city, time passes, but you can see that nothing changes in these ravaged lands. Since the massacre ...several winters had passed. And now it's the third winter. The sky couldn't be darker... than the bottom of my heart, if it weren't for a ray of light... Rejoice, O people! Let me shed some of the light... that shines in my heart since the unforgettable autumn... When I saw eight holy ghosts get deep inside my will and emerged steel-clad from it. Lost in the dark, clinging to their hopes... they remained in prison for over two years. Then one day, they came out like angels of vengeance. Tell me! Who can defeat an army of ghosts? Listen, O immortal ones! You wallow in mud... Miloud's day of truth has arrived! And you still buzz around the scum that strangers threw at you... ...and like flies delighted by crumbs. What a shame! What a pity? Let God curse and punish... those who give up this encounter with destiny! Listen, folks! Listen, O coward's pack! They are the eight Lions. Their roars will awaken you. They were arrested in the year of the massacre. Torture and starvation could not break their faith. They spent two summers and two winters from one prison to another. Autumn has come and they have turned into ghosts. They broke their chains and came to the top of the mountains. War chants echoed from the heights: There is only one way, one solution to be able to attain liberation. Let God curse and punish... those who give up this encounter with destiny! God damn it, miserable man! Do you dare insult your masters? May God curse them! Please don't hurt my friend Miloud! He has not done anything. You took my father, only Miloud remained. Let your ghosts help you. There are soldiers to hunt them. More soldiers have arrived! I have to warn my father. Your father? Do you know where he is? Yes. Do you have acorns? The season is over. What about chestnuts? Yes, follow me, son. Where is my father? At a meeting in the valley. NOVEMBER 1, 1954 Baba! You are now a man... You should know the truth. Do you see that blood? It's from your father. We had a meeting... We were betrayed! I have an automatic rifle. I'll protect you. - You're crazy! - That was our understanding. Your father was a brave man. Follow your path. Listen and rejoice, O people! The ghosts have started the war! They will fight to open all closed doors! According to their faith, they will defy death. Their footsteps will awaken those who have slept since the invader's arrival. Disgrace! Shame... ...to those who refuse to join this fire! NOVEMBER 11, 1954 "Those who died bravely for their homeland deserve to be beloved by the people. They will be the best among the best. Nothing can steal their glory. And like a mother's voice, all the people are singing so that they can rest peacefully in their graves... Victory always belongs to France! Glory to those who died for her! "To the martyrs, those who are proud and strong... Those inspired by his path... who want to join them at the temple... and who will die in their turn..." Ah, Allah! All-powerful, great and merciful. A thousand thanks for having brought Miloud in whom no one believed, to this place, at the end of a long journey. Blessed be this madness that you have given me O lord! Blessed be this madness for which I am known, which made me see the light. Blessed be this madness and all his promise. This blessed madness, sharper than a plow that neither rust nor time can tarnish... This blessed madness, hotter than a spear... Bless this moment when you call me! Bless me as you lead me. Bless the evils that have befallen me! Blessed be the years of ashes, the ember years that arrived like lightning! Blessed be the years of fire, whose burns are eternal... and whose flames burn in every house... in every village... And now... I am ready to accept my rest... in your world of peace. ON JULY 5, 1962, AFTER MORE THAN A MILLION MARTYRS OFFERED THEIR LIVES, THE ALGERIAN PEOPLE WON THEIR INDEPENDENCE.
