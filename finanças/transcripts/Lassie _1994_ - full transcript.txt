Lassie, come home! All right, folks, it's moving day. I thought I told you not to watch this crap. I like Lassie. Jennifer! You'll thank me when you're older. Jennifer! Breakfast, honey. You better hurry. - Oh, I'm sorry. - I'm fine! Matt, 2:30! We're going! Steve, you didn't load that brown suitcase, did you? Yes, honey. It's in the u-haul. It's under four other suitcases. I put Jennifer's books in there. - I need them for the trip. - Why would you do that? I'm sorry. Honey. - Last minute jitters. - Me, too. Does this move make sense? Yes. We're going to be living in the house where Anne grew up. I can handle that... I think. Think about it, Jennifer. How many kids are there in the world? - I don't know. - Like billions, okay? - A quarter of those are kids, right? - Yeah. Well, that means 250 million kids at about three presents a kid. That means 750 million presents, in one night, with one guy and eight reindeer. Dad! - What's going on? - Nothing. - It's impossible, Jen. The guy is a hoax. - Mom! Her name is Laura. We've got a long drive ahead of us, girl. Hey, Matt, what do you say we stop and get something to eat, huh? Hey, Matt! Matt! Look out! What a mess. I got it. Here we go. Yeah, bring it on back. Come on back. That's good, John! All right, people, back in your cars. All right, everyone. Come on, load up. Looks like we're moving. Hey, Matt, look! It's Lassie! Jennifer, please. You know there's no such thing as Lassie. First Santa claus, now thi... - Holy cow. - See, I told you. It is Lassie! - Jennifer. - It's Lassie, dad. - Jennifer, don't touch a strange dog. - It's hurt. - Jen, he'll be fine. Come on. - It's a shel - come on. - We can't just leave her here. - Sure, we can. - Steve. Honey, please! She's all alone. Matt, hop in. It's half the price for lumber, so the cost per square foot is a bargain. And there's no big-city hassle for permits. Can I play the jukebox? I got my own money. No Paula Abdul or Janet Jackson. - You're not going to eat that? - I'm not hungry. Then why did you order it? Look, it's Lassie. She's back! Jennifer, it's not Lassie. - How do you know? - 'Cause Lassie doesn't exist. Yeah, well, whatever doesn't exist just followed us here. - Can we keep her? - Of course not. Why? Because it probably belongs to somebody, and we're full enough as it is. - There she is. - How did you find us? - Jen, be careful. - See? She loves us. She wants to be with us. Sweetie, she doesn't really love us. She just wants food. Come on. - But kids are supposed to have dogs. - Jennifer! - It helps us grow up right. - I think she's sweet. - Honey, you 100? - Come on. It's weird enough as it is. - Why not add a dog? - Honey, come on! - Why not? - Please, dad! This is ridiculous. Where would we put it? How about the back seat? Come on, let's take her. Please, dad! All right, the back seat. Yes! Hey, Matt. Hey, cut it out! Cut it out! Get away from me. I'm coming, I'm coming. Move over. - This dog stinks. - Look who's talking! I don't have fur! Come here, Lassie. Come, lass. Well... This is it. - Franklin falls. - A hundred and forty-eight? It's the country, pal. There's room out here. A hundred and forty-eight? There's more people than that in a supermarket. Matt! There's more people than that on a subway. - You've never been on a subway. - I know what they hold. You took us to nowhere. That's where we moved. - We moved to nowhere. - In a little while, you'll like it here. In a little while, I'm gonna take a bus back to Baltimore. - There's my grandkids! - Grandpa! - Hello, Princess. How are you? - I missed you, grandpa. I missed you, too, honey. How's my big fella”? - Is that an earring you're wearing, son? - Yeah. - Hi, len. - Hello, Steve. Len, I'd like you to meet my wife, Laura. - I'm glad to meet you, ma'am. - It's a pleasure to finally meet you. I can't tell you how good it is to have these two youngsters back with me. - What do we have here? - That's our new dog. Just a stray we picked up on the side of the road. Just a stray? This is a beautiful dog. With a fine pedigree, I bet you. See? Well, I guess you folks would like to see the house before it gets dark. I'll get the truck and you can follow me. That's all right, len. I remember the way. Thank you. There you are. I'll see you tomorrow. - Right. We'll see you then. - Bye-bye, grandpa. - Good to see you, Matt. - Bye, grandpa. Matt, all aboard. All right, come on. Wow! Is that our farm? - It's beautiful! - No, sweetie, we're up the road. Wouldn't you know, it's starting to rain. No way. This is it? Don't worry. It'll be better inside. Wait. Let me turn on the light. Great. Doesn't work. There you go, sweetie. Be careful. There's a note. What? From len. "The electricity went down in a bad storm. Should be back in a couple of weeks. Sorry for the mess. I tidied up the best I could. Len." So there's no TV? No, Matt, there's no TV. That's means there's no mtv. Oh, great. Really great. Why don't we just kill ourselves? Matt. Take my hand, sweetie. Watch your step there. Let's take a look upstairs. This bed should be okay. We'll use sleeping bags until we get the sheets unpacked. Why bother? Hey. You and I are gonna unload the car. Hey, don't forget this. Great. No pavement. What am I gonna do with this? What kind of kid would want to live here? Hey, it wasn't so bad for your mother! Could this be my room, Laura? I don't think anyone is gonna fight you for it, honey. Yes! Which room do you want, Matt”? Still raining. Listen, Matt, about what I said outside... Forget it. It was nothing. No? You know... Right after your mother died, I made a point not to talk about her in front of you, because I could see how much it upset you. I don't know if that was the right thing to do. I know we can't bring her back, but that doesn't mean we need to forget her. Good night, son. - Dad, are you going to tuck me in? - I'll be right there. - You, too, Laura. - Okay, sweetheart. I'm coming up. Well, everybody wants the dog, I let the dog out. That's all right. Come on. Oh, my g... Cool! - Pots and pans. - Okay, that's a start. All right, I'm off. I'll come back for you later. Then we're gonna go to the store. Have a good meeting. - You've got enough for breakfast? - Five boxes of pop-tarts. - Honey, we don't have a toaster. - Steve, get out of here. Okay, I'll call you later. I'll let you know how it goes. - We don't have a phone. - Honey, it's gonna be fine. I know. - I'll see you later. - Okay. Jennifer and I are going for a walk. Do you want to come? It's not like the city, you know. We're both gonna be short on friends here. What do you want? Hey, come on, cut it out. Look, I said, cut it out! Hey! Hey! Come back here! Come on! Give me those! Drop those! Drop those right now! I'm gonna kill you! Give me my headphones! Wait a minute! Stay! Stay! Heel! Give me those! If you don't drop those... Whoal How did you find this place? Man, they got a rope here and everything. Cool. Looks cold. That was awesome! That was totally awesome! I'm not kidding! - Anything with that? - No, I'm fine. Thank you. Mr. jarman, since our last conversation, I've worked out three preliminary options for the site, depending on how much of the existing structure is going to remain. - Based on your budget... - That's what we need to talk about. What? Hi, Steve. How'd it go? - They don't want it. - Don't want what? The new house, remodeling, nothing. Why? He says he was running high credit at the bank, way too high. The man just lost half his flock, and insurance isn't going to pay for it. Len, I pulled my kids out of school for this job. This was going to cover me for six to nine months. Well, it's a lousy break. It's a damn lousy break. But, you know, you got you one job, you'll get another. That or some other type of work. “What other work? Well, being in the store, I hear about things. There's always folks needing help fixing this or that. You mean, being a handyman? Len, I'm a builder. I'm a contractor. Stop! Don't shoot! Hey, mister, that's my dog. Don't worry. I think I know the difference between a coyote and a collie. Now, boys are another thing. I don't often see one I don't know on my land. - Aren't lost, are you? - No, I know my way. - I'm staying down at the Collins farm. - Collins, huh? Boy, I bet you had to dust the cobwebs out of that place. - Yeah, you're not kidding. - Well, have a nice visit. Thanks, but we're not visiting. We're gonna live there. Live there? Well, now that's good news. I got two boys just about your age. I'll send them around. You tell your daddy Sam garland says welcome. Went out hunting coyotes today. Josh, pass this down to your mother. I ran into a youngster, said they was moving onto the Collins place. That's all right. As long as they don't mess around with our flock. - Right, boys? - They won't, sir. Me and Jim will take care of that. Now you're talking. That's what I like to hear. Sam, you mustn't encourage the boys to do anything malicious. It's not the way... Now, Mildred, who said anything about malicious? I just want my boys to keep an eye on things. We need that pasture. - You know what I mean, don't you, Jim? - Yes, sir. - Josh, you know what I'm talking about? - Yes, sir. Mildred, you're a wonderful cook. - I don't understand. - What don't you understand? They've gone under. - And you want to stay here anyway? - Where are we gonna go, Laura? - Home. - There's no such thing anymore. - I could get my job back at the bank. - Well, I could get other work around here. - Doing what? - I'll find something. Honey, look, I don't want the kids to grow up in the city. I'd like them to see the sky, hear the birds, not that noise. I'd like them to walk home at night and not worry about what's behind them. - Am I really wrong to feel that way? - No, of course not. - Don't worry. They'll think you're cool. - Really? Yeah. Class, we have a brand-new student coming into our grade eight that's just moved into this area. Now, Matt Turner doesn't know anybody here, so I want us all to make him really welcome. - Hi, Matt. - How you doing? And now April will give us a grade-nine presentation of her 4-h club project. April? Jim, Josh, stop that. This is Charlotte, a six-month-old toggenburg goat, who I helped birth and then disbudded at one week. Toggenburgs are the oldest registered breed of any animal in the world. Their markings are always light brown with white accents and they are excellent milk producers. Thank you, April. That was a very imaginative demonstration. Now, I'd like to encourage the rest of the class to accompany their science projects with practical demonstrations like the one April presented. Now, if you turn in your books to chapter 17... How you doing, girl? Can you believe that? Show-and-tell with a goat? I can't believe I live herel you know what would happen at my old school if I put a goat on a desk? Wait up! I'm not a dog, you know. Are you sure this is the right way back? Yeah, I guess you're right. Probably through those trees. Come on. This isn't funny. Is this the only trick you know? Come on! Give me back my bag! Come on! Wait up, will you! I told you, it's not funny! Give me my bag. You like making me chase you, don't you? Hey, come on, quit it. There it is. Doesn't look like such a dump from up here. "Ac." That's my mom. "Ac." that's my mom. Anne Collins. How did you know? I thought once we get the weeds out, we could have some flowers, maybe some geraniums. And over here I thought would be a great place for a vegetable garden. A garden? Yeah. What do you know about gardening? Not a thing. - Hi, Steve. Laura. - Hey, len. Well, I told you I'd hear about some work, and I have. Yeah”? Up at the Walker ranch, they're looking to repair all the outbuildings and the fences. They'll furnish all the tools. You won't have to bring a thing. - Repairing fences. - Well, that's all there is for now. No, I understand. Well, at least I'll be outside. - Your apple pie is great, Laura. - In celebration of good old electricity. - What's this thing? - Looks like an old record player. Are these old cds? No, sweetie, these are 45s. Let's see if this thing works. - Did you try plugging it in? - Yeah. "Proud Mary." "Jimmy mack"? I used to listen to these when I was a kid. Those records were your mama's, Jennifer. She used to play 'em all day long. Just like Matt with his head attachment. I know this one. Mom used to sing it to us. Remember, Matt? What, you can't find it? What is it? I'm coming. What is it, girl? What are you looking at, girl? It's my mom's diary. Thanks, Lassie. "April 23. Today I got up early and rode lucky through the high pasture, all the way fo the mountain pool. It was foo cold fo swim, so we sat there for a while." I forgot about the time and was almost late for school. On Saturday, dad let me help him split wood and then showed me how to mend the goat pen and put up the new wire in the chicken Coop. Mom said, "len, what are you teaching her lo use an ax and hammer for?" And daddy said, "so she can lake the place over someday, if she wants fo. Maybe raise her own kids here.” I didn't tell mom then, but that's just what I want fo do... Have a real sheep farm someday, right here. After all, we've got some of the best grazing land around. And, of course, I'll need fo get a sheepdog. I already know what kind... a collie. [ Think I'll name if lass... Sing me the one about the mockingbird. Oh, I think I know that one. I love you, mom. I love you, too. Lassie, believe me, you don't want to go out in that storm. Lassie? No, Lassie! Good girl! Quiet, girl. Don't wake them up. Come on, girl. You're a pretty brave dog, you know that? What happened? Nothing, Jen. It's okay. Just go back to bed. She's hurt. She's fine. Help me dry her off. I thought I told you to be quiet. I thought I told you to be quiet, too. What did you think of the flip, Lassie? Not bad, huh? Are you kidding? That was great. Where did you learn how to do that? That's no big deal. Yeah? You can't do it. - How do you know, dung head? - 'Cause I know you're a spaz. You're Matt, right? "Let's all make Matt real welcome, because he doesn't know anybody around here." Knock it off, Jim. “What? I'm April Porter. This is Jim and Josh garland. - You're from the Collins farm, right? - Yeah. What a hole! We like it okay. - Can you do a back flip? - Sure. Let's see. Yeah, maybe some other time. - Come on, do it. - He can't do it. I can do it. I just don't want to. Yeah, right. He just doesn't want to. Our dad is the biggest sheep farmer in the whole state. My folks are going away this weekend. Why not come over Saturday night? - We're going to rent some cool videos. - I don't think so, Josh. My parents already have other plans. Wait till you see our place. Now this is a real farm. Stay here, Lassie. I'll only be a minute. Come on in. Make yourself at home. You have a swimming pool in your living room. - You like guns? - Yeah, I guess. Look at that. Bolt-action .22. It's mine. You get all this from raising sheep? Sure do. "Warm, durable American wool." - We know the motto, Jim. - Well, he doesn't. I'm coming, girl. Lassie? Where'd you go? Lassiel there she is. Bringing in a stray. Good as any sheepdog. Good girl, Lassie. Hey, Matt, ever seen so many lamb chops on a hoof? - Josh! - April's so sensitive. They're not pets, April. Just wool and good eating. I gotta go. Bye. - Well, I'll see you guys around. - Yeah. See you. Come on, lass! Come on, girl. Big city guy's gonna run off with your girlfriend. Shut up! Lamebrain. You stretch the wire, you pound in the staple, then you go on to the next post. Stretch the wire, pound in the staple, go on to the next post. Oh, my god. I have a question. What does 4-h mean? It stands for "head, heart, hands and health." - Well, see you. - Bye. Bye. = orien ses ss Ean == That's good. All right. Hey, where you going? Wait up! Coyotes. It'll be all right. It'll be fine. It's just sleeping. Lassie, I don't know what to do. I'm not a vet. Just forget about it. All right. Come on, lass. Here. Is April here? It's okay, dad. Ees I was wondering, could you come over to my house for a little while? The thing is, I need some help. It's in here. - Will it be okay? - I don't know. Sometimes they can make it without a mother, sometimes they can't. It just depends on the sheep. Keep a blanket over it tonight, because it probably gets pretty cold in here. I'll bring you some extra formula tomorrow. Okay. Yeah, you like that, don't you? Yeah, you do. I don't think it's hurt or anything. It just looks really hungry. - You're from Baltimore, right? - Yeah. I've been there once. It was cool. - Thanks for coming over. - Sure. - I better get going home. - Yeah. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Right. - Matt, guess what! - Not now, Jen. But guess what! “What? We're going home! Moving back? Well, it's not definite, but I'll know pretty soon. Maybe in a few days. Wait a minute. What are you talking about? Your dad just got a call about a job, a good one, in Baltimore. They've been trying to track him down for a week. That place I interviewed a month ago. At the time, they didn't have anything. You don't have to take it, do you? Have to? No. But I'd need a hell of a reason not to. What about the job you have here? Mending fences at five dollars an hour? Hey. What's going on? I thought you'd want to move back. Yeah, sure. Why not? It doesn't matter to me either way. I didn't tell mom then, but that's just what I want fo do... Have a real sheep farm someday, right here. - What do you mean, how do they do it? - You saw their ranch. - They make a fortune. How do they do it? - Well, they raise a lot of sheep. - And that's it? - Well, yeah. And they've got the best pasture land around here. Great! That's what I'm trying to say! - Now, where is this pasture land? - I don't know. Down around greenly's, the whole high Meadow. Why? - Well, that's their flock, right? - Yeah. - And this is their pasture land, right? - Right. So what's that fence? I come by here every day, and there's no other fence between here and our farm. I've seen their sheep grazing all over here, all the way up to the creek. All right, let's just say that this is our land. - I don't know. - Let's just say. Somebody's put that fence here for something. You know, raising sheep is not as easy as it looks. - You need pens and a sheepdog... - I've got the dog! Lassie, go! Round them up! Bring them here, girl! Good girl! So this is our boundary, right? That puts our farmhouse right here. - I can read a plat map. - Right, sorry. - Anyway, this is the garlands' ranch. - Yeah, I've seen it. Guess whose land they're using? Ours. They've got sheep all over that pasture and they're making a killing on it. That's the best grazing land in the whole area. If it's done right, you can really make some money. Three hundred ewes and 20 or so rams, by the end of next year you have 450 sheep. - What's going on? - I think your brother just lost his mind. Dad, you ought to see the garlands' ranch... I'm a contractor. I don't know the first thing about farming, and neither do you. - Grandpa does. - I'm no expert, but I do know the basics. Counting the animals and the construction, that's doing labor ourselves, we could probably get started for 30,000, 35,000. I'm sorry, Matt. I'd be lucky to cover half of that. If you'd be willing, I'd be glad to put up the other half. That's very generous of you, but we couldn't ask you to do that. Nothing generous about it. The fact is, I'm kind of thinking about myself. I'd sure like to have these grandkids around me. You want to stay here? Yeah. Yeah, I really do. What do you think we should do? I wish I knew. Come on. Let me try. Okay, just don't tilt the bottle too much. - Come on, you'll drown the thing. - I am not. All right, that's enough. That's done. Don't worry. I got another one. There you go. Well, I hope you're not driving. Me, too. That's the whole flock. I brought them down from the high pasture on Friday. So, how many is that? 380 and 34, that's just about right for the land we got. How much? Like I said on the phone, I don't know about this. Sam garland said he might be interested in the whole flock. So are we. What's he offering? We talked about 57 a head for the ewes. We'd like to offer you $60 a head, Pete. Well, 60 is fair. - I'd say so. - More than fair. - But garland was here first. - I don't understand the problem. We'd like the whole flock. We're willing to offer you three dollars more a head. It's all right, Mr. jarman. - We can certainly respect your position. - Honey. I'm sure you and Sam garland go way back, and he'd do the same for you. I hope we didn't take up too much of your time. Come on. Come on. Come on, Lassie. I'm sorry we couldn't work something out, Pete. Honey. Honey, what are you doing? Don't worry about it. He's pressuring himself more than we ever will. Hey, hold up a minute. The flock's yours if you can pay today. - Pete, you'll have the money by 5:00. - All right. You were right. There's just one more thing. You got just ten days to get 'em out of here. You think you can do that? What are you doing? Real funny! That was a good one, right? Yeah, really funny. Over there. Well, there it is. That's our farm. Good little horse. Never been on him before. Never been on him before. Good little horse. What's wrong with this little horse, Jim? I don't know, sir. - Josh? - Nothing, sir. His steps are good. But there is something else wrong. - It's with the sheep. - The sheep? Them new people up at the Collins place just set their collie on our flock. Drove every one of them off that south pasture. Well, let's see, I guess we can stand around here talking about it or we can take our hands out of our pockets and get down to business and drive them back. Come on. Yes, sir. We would've had it done, but we can't. They got a fence going up, all the way across. A fence? Imagine that. Come on, Lassie! - Sheep! Sheep! - Goonin! Say, where are you going with my sheep? I thought we had a deal, Pete. We did. They're paying more money. It's simple business. Uh-huh. Well, buying sheep is simple. It's making a living off of them that's not so simple. Right, Pete? Now, don't misunderstand me. I can buy sheep anywhere. Anywhere, anyplace. This flock is yours. I'm just here in case you want to reconsider. Reconsider? Why should we? Pete's a full-time farmer. He couldn't cut it. Ever think about that? - We're aware of the risks. - Well, that's a good thing. 'Cause I'm sure you've tied up a good deal of money. Want me to tell 'em about your business? Pastures you're grazing that ain't yours? You know, Pete, you sure got a lot braver since you stopped working for me. I hate to interrupt these pleasantries, gentlemen, but we are on a schedule here, and thanks a lot for your concern, Sam. All right. It was nice meeting you, neighbor. Come on, boys. Let's leave these ranchers to their work. - Come on! - Come on, sheep! Come on, sheep! Look at him! Don't let him get away! Come on! Come on, come on! Hurry up! Good job, Lassie. All right. Hi. Howdy. "Howdy"? Well, yeah, we're ranchers now. Now, listen... I just want you to know that I am really proud of you, and not just for the ranch and sheep and all of that, but for everything. And... Your mom would have been proud of you, too. Hey, dad? Yeah? Do you still miss her? Well, sure, I do. No. No, I mean... I mean now, with Laura and everything. I love Laura. But that doesn't mean I'll ever stop loving your mom. I don't know if I do. What? Love her. I mean, I try and I try. All I can remember is a couple of things at the end. And you know, those kind of go stale after a while. I'm glad we came here, dad. I am, too. - Let's go, Matt. - We've got to pick up those supplies. Come on, Lassie. Prepare to scare the hell out of them sheep! - Yeah! - Yeah! All right, l... Lassie? Lassie? Grandpa, where's Lassie? - She must have jumped off. - Lassie's gone! All right, let's head back. Len, I'll be right behind you. Come on, sheep! Yeah! Sheep, sheep! Lassiel whoa! Yeah! Dumb dog! Get away! Jim, it's my foot! Let loose! Get away! Keep it away! Lassiel we were worried about you. - There she is. She came home. - Well, what do you know. Nothing wrong after all. - What in the hell is this? - A fence. We've talked about your sheep overrunning this pasture. I guess you've been meaning to get to it, but when I saw the fence go up at the Collins place, I figured I'd save you the trouble and take care of it myself. Hello, delbert? Sam garland. Listen, I need a pickup, day after tomorrow, early A.M. Going to the Benton market. Okay? Now, listen, there's just one thing different. I want you to come around to the backside of the mountain. Hi, April? It's me, Matt. I was just calling because the fair starts tomorrow night. I was thinking that maybe we could go together. Yeah, you know, to learn more about livestock and everything. Oh, you can? Great, okay. Bye. What? April? Josh. Hey, you going to the fair tomorrow night? Yeah? Me, too. What say I pick you up about 6:30? Who? Yeah, well, maybe I'll see you there. No, it's okay. Bye. Nice try. - That was real nice. - Did you see that flip? Yeah, I got yours. Step right up and get your cotton candy! - Cotton candy! - Come on. Here we go, 9 moving out in front right away. Here comes 11. Go for it! Now it's 11 and 14, 11 and 14. Here comes 12, squeezing in there. - Come on, 14. Yeah! - And the winner is 14! All right! - Thanks. - There you go. Congratulations. - Here you go. - How sweet. Thanks. Come on, Lassie. Would you like to try one? Okay. Look at the calf. Isn't it cute? - See how big this one is? - Oh, yeah. - His breeder is the best in the county. - Really? Look at that guy's horns. This guy's won more blue ribbons than anyone else... - Hi, grandpa! - Hey, Princess. Come on. - I heard they make you dizzy. - Only the first time. What a geek! Give me one. - Hey, April. - Hi, Josh. - Hey, April. Hey, Kelly. - Hi, Jim. - And speaking of geeks... - Shut up, Josh. Oh, April standing by her man! Real cute. Too bad he's not gonna be here next year. - You want one, geek? - No, I quit. Oh. Real cool. Too bad you look like a faggot with that earring. I like his earring. In fact... can I have it? Sure. - Thanks. - Come on, Jim. Stay. Thanks for coming to the fair with me. I had a good time. Good night. Come on, Lassie. She's my girl, geek! Get off of me! How do you like that? Get it off! Your dog bit me! Call her off! - There you go. - Thanks. How's the knee? It's not that bad. Let me see. You should have seen the other guy. This is really nice of you. What are stepmothers for? Sorry. Wish there was something else I could call you. I can't call you "mom" and "stepmother” is too dweeby. What's wrong with "Laura"? Oh, I don't know. I guess you're more than that, too. Hey, why are you crying? Matt. Quiet. Quiet. Take it easy. Don't make so much noise. Come on, sheep. Sheep, sheep. You were out an hour ago. All right, you're the boss. Sheep, sheep. Come on, sheep. What took you so long? Come on, you stupid dog. Come on! Get her in the truck! Okay, pop. Go on. Giddap! Come on, sheep! Come on, sheep! Giddap! That ought to hold you. What? What is it, girl? Where's our sheep? Where are they, girl? Yeah, those are ours. Come on, Lassie, let's get 'em back home. - Bye, dad. - Hey. Is your brother up yet? He's gonna miss the bus. - Have a good day. - Okay. - Matt! - He isn't in there. Hey, Matt. Matt? Oh, my god. Honey. Honey, the sheep are gone. Matt! Matt! Good, Lassie. Easy. Easy, girl. Where are you going with our sheep? These aren't your sheep. They's on our land. Put 'em back. Now! It's all right. Go home, Lassie! Nol! God! Damn you! That's my old man's best rifle. It's all right, Lassie, go! Go home! Help! Help me! Help! Help me! Dad! Take my hand! Matt! Matt! Help! Matt! Matt! Lassie, swim to the tree. - Lassie! - No! Swim, Lassie! Swim! Lassiel swim, Lassie! Lassiel lassiel Come on. It's all right, it's all right. Josh! Jim! Hey, buddy. Matt saved Josh's life. I can't tell you how sorry I am. We didn't even get to bury her. I know. But in a way she'll always be here, and every time you come back to this place and you see her name, you'll think of her. She was a great dog. Beautiful. I was the first one to see her. Remember? On the side of the road. No, Lassie... - Was... - A hero. Yeah. It's hard to imagine now, Matt, but you'll get you another dog and love that one just as much. No, I don't think so. Well, we gotta have a sheepdog, Matt. Then we'll get a Shepherd or a lab. Not a collie. We don't have to think about that today. Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the declaration of independence in 1776, was elected third president of the United States in 1801 and held office until 1809. He was a very well-known virginian and a great president. He was an architect, a horticulturalist and a world-renowned statesman. George Washington is known as the father of our country, but Jefferson is known as the father of the state of Virginia. He was born 1743 and died in 1826. And in the spring, the whole class will be taking a field trip to Thomas Jefferson's home in monticello, which Mr. Jefferson designed and had constructed to his specifications. Lassiel Lassie, you came home! I love you.
