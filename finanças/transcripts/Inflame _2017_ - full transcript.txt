No! No! Don't google it! - Like you have an idea at all! - Of course, I've plenty! TRAFFIC ACCIDENT TAKES 35 LIVES It's so hot. Hasret, TV news not enough? Now you need to check the paper? Yes, Mehmet. Though the news she saw today will be in the papers tomorrow, Mehmet. Exactly. It's what she heard yesterday. Sarcasm, it's all you can do! You learn this on social media. Listen! The midday news. Muzaffer Brothers said they follow TwitTurk closely... and they disapprove popular writers criticising the government. Now, take that! - What happened to your hand, Hasret? - Just a burn. - When you put... - I beg you, don't start again! - It always ends in a dispute. - No way! We are talking here. When you put the word "social" before "media", you're fooled to think that people are in power. Hallelujah! - Hasret, how's your documentary going? - Yep, what about it? What bugs me is that you think hatred would end... - if social media ceased to exist. - Yeah, it spews hatred. At least agree to that. These guys are everywhere, thanks to you. Hasret, your tea is cold. Which guys? Thanks to us?! - Yes, thanks to you. - You just sit here and tweet. That aside, I really admire those hackers. - Admire what? - They're modern-day knights. It's all about cyber-attacks now. - Nonsense. - Cyber viper! I really can't hold my tongue. Where do you cyber-attack? What good is it? Take to the streets and protest at least. What protest? Are you talking about the same twenty people... who go back home black and blue after each demonstration? - It is pointless! - You're pointless! At least they do something. They have guts! All you do is sit on your ass and submit posts. Oh get real, Hasret. Remember who you work for! Maybe then you'll think twice before blabbing about social media. She only edits documentaries there. Not writing the news, you buffoon! Oh please! She's editing some bullshit written by some media mogul. Don't fool yourself! Remember the guy talking is driving a jeep! Thanks to that so called social responsibility project! - What's the score, Deniz? -Dunno. - Check your phone. - What about your phone? - Low battery. Your "socially responsible" jeep is very related to the subject. - Who's playing who? - Oh God, what am I doing with you guys? There are a few people in the world not interested in football. Join the club. Yeah sure, you know exactly how things should be! - Someone should focus on cinema. - Not you, I hope! INFLAME Your work sucks! Get your asses to my office. - What's up, Zeki? - Nothing. WHAT YOU SEE IS TRUE. WHAT YOU HEAR IS TRUE. This is provocation. Now, when I look back... that day people were jailed on false evidence. These are good people. The ideals they offer... Congratulations. It's hard to explain their efforts to change and transform... a nation, to give us strength. Thanks for giving me the chance to talk about the documentary. A documentary captions Muzaffer Brothers... A documentary, a book... It's not enough, there's a lot to do. Hurry, dude. Put on Eloglu's speech. - Play! - As you know, I was brought to court again last week. They just love taking me to court. A bit further. Keep going. Okay! Dozens died only on Monday. We're deeply hurt. Then, the next day, on Tuesday, Three musicians jailed for their songs get released. Is that coincidence? Where's justice? Where's humanity? "Where's justice? Where's humanity?" Cut there. Keep this with his picture. Write "Eloglu on the Offensive." Keep going. Now, wait... bring up the Hijra Special footage. Are you leaving out the bit about the release of the musicians? We're running late. - Go on. - Happy editing, Ali! - Hasret. - Yes? Bimbo watched the episode you finished. She wants you to delete that part on the female lawyer. - Leyla Senal? -I guess! - Did she say why? - To whom! Me? - Whatever, Beril. - You'll talk to her then. - Yes! Okay! Yes, Ms Terken. APPROACH - FREED MUSICIANS SPEAK: REAL FOLK SONGS DON'T LIE has a very important place. After Hittites, Phrygians, Cimmerians and Medes... the new occupants of the region were Persians. The origins of the word Cappadocia has been a point of discussion. According to some writers, the word is derived from Kappadoks... an arm of the Kizilirmak River... According to others it originates from Assyrian Prince Capadok's name. Today, In Persian, Cappadocia means... "land of beautiful horses". Listen up! Focus on the lyrics. - But you're not with me? - You go ahead, love. Won't touch Muslims, he said Have my word, no blood will be shed He kept his word, no blood, do harm The solution to my troubles Riders came, riders ran Mothers saved some of them Whole city, burnt again Beautiful horses land Solution to my troubles Solution to my troubles You can't do politics at the cost of public order! These are fragile regions. The people here are sensitive. If you're going to protest, go ahead, but do it properly! He had the same argument with the former news director. What was her name? Was it Gonca, or Aysel? I don't know. It was a woman. When's my turn coming! Editors to my office! Don't be afraid, I won't bite. AUTHOR HUSEYIN UGUR TALKS AGAIN... THE STATUE TRIGGERED THE INCIDENTS - Good morning. - Morning. - Bimbo is after me. - What does she want? She's gonna give me a raise! - To her office? - Yes. Say hi. Ring me before you leave for lunch. - Okay. Happy working! - Don't be annoying, Hasret. NEWS DIRECTOR No. I'm asking how you managed to screw it up. I want a report ASAP. The guy is talking about his movie on HanTV right now. Don't you hear me? Do you hear me? Oh, this is getting ridiculous. Of course, it's live. Don't you have a TV at home? Switch it on and see for yourself! - Now, yes, Hasret. You! - Me? You start newsreel editing today. - How come? - Do I have to answer? - Any reason? - Now you do news bulletins. That's it. Maybe you don't know, Ms Terken... I've been working here for 7 years. I've always edited documentaries... Remember, it's not just you. I have my plate full. Haluk is chief editor now. He'll finish the documentary. Okay? Haluk? - Not happy? - I didn't mean that... Now she's not happy. We can't keep waiting for you. You just failed to complete a documentary! But the shooting is not finished yet. You should've dealt with the tapes as they came in. Does it need reminding? You can't even cut the right words, properly. - What do you mean by "right words"? - Enough. Those are the orders. They call the shots. Making comments is not me. I follow. Okey-dokey? Hasret, I heard you are in news room now. Yes. I'm really sorry for you... but the minister's speech must be ready by 11. What? For real! Am I to edit a minister's speech! - The editor is eating her hat inside. - So what? Where's Ali? He won't be back for another 30 minutes. C'mon! Get cracking! Yes. You know what happened yesterday. He stops Furkan Muzaffer with excuses of a burnt-down building. He comes up and says: "My child needs work." How is that any concern of Muzaffer Brothers? Now the protestors ask why we shut down that decrepit old place? Close up, please. What happens now? There will be employment. Is that so? When that beautiful shopping mall is complete... your children will have jobs. Look... The man found work for 10 million with just 1 mall. If you want to criticise, you can try a newspaper column. Fine. If you know what you want let's just jump to those. No. We have to listen to all of it. The ticker is ready, though: "Economic growth in Turkey." What ticker! Tickers are written in the control room? Since Bimbo turned up, we write it in the editing room. Why? Darling, can you ask your boring questions to your editing friends... over lunch or something? - Sure, darling. - What? You know Haluk. The dimwit! How can they put Haluk in charge? Oh come on! I've been editing for 16 years, Mehmet. Fine! But please come on Saturday. Need to talk to you. What are you laughing about? This is important. - You're alive! - So are you! You hung up earlier... I thought something happened. You didn't call back... There were other things. It slipped my mind. - You didn't check your mobile? - No, I'd have got back to you. - Are you against mobiles, now? - Oh Mehmet! - Urban renewal? - What? - All this wood and stuff? Oh, I'm making a wooden bench kind of thing. With legs and all. Like... Whatever. I don't get a thing. You know. Just like in the movies. Woman sits by the window... in tiny shorts, ruffled hair and glasses, reading books. - I guess I wanted to be like them. - Which movies exactly? Aren't you supposed to be packing up rather than making things? - I went to a park today. - And? - I heard a song there. The tune, the voice, everything was different. In fact, it wasn't that different. It was played by a flute. It sounded like nothing I've heard before. But at one point I realised I knew it. I searched the lyrics online. Nothing came up. Maybe it's not commercial... Could be unreleased. Then, how come I know it? People do put their own songs online. I'm sure even you know that! Look! It was something like this... A pretty bird had I Loved it so did I She flew away? Was that it? I'm not sure of that part. Mehmet, I keep thinking about the past. Trying to understand what happened to my parents. I actually know what happened, but just can't remember. I don't follow. They didn't die in a car crash. Something else happened. Hasret, what's the matter with you? Nothing! I just seem to remember things. What, for instance? Never mind. I'm losing it... It's nothing. - But they didn't die in a car crash. - Okay. I wonder if aunt Gulsum kept a journal or something. I looked everywhere. Couldn't find a thing. Every day I check the date of their death on the web. As if anything would change overnight! I scanned archives at work. There's nothing about the incident! I thought, fuck with this channel! I asked Yasemin for help. She did some research. She came up with nothing either. Maybe nothing happened back then. - Then... I thought... - What? What if something is hidden from us? - You mean from all of us? - All of us! - Isn't that a little paranoid? - Paranoid? I've checked all available news archives. I scanned that day, the day after and the one after that. All I find is culture, sports news, and lists of births and deaths. - Nothing political? - No. - Nothing at all? - No! Nothing! What happened to my mom and dad? What? It is as if something very serious happened! I seem to know about it. I actually do. How can I remember something that I already know? Now you've only forgotten a song. That happens. Maybe your aunt hid it from you if what happened was traumatic. Maybe she wanted to tell you, but she didn't live long enough. I was 20 when my aunt died. What is a good age, Mehmet? But, didn't your aunt have aphasia? Yes, but she was able to utter some words. Let's say, something serious happened, as you said... how come nobody knows about it? What? Everyone forgot? You don't even know what you're looking for! What do you think you'll find? I cannot find, that's it. In any case, they control the net. Hasret, please! You're freaking me out. Why are you questioning all this now? I've had nightmares every night for the past 3 weeks! Literally, every night. It's always the same nightmare. Sometimes, a few images change. I hear things. No, not that kind. Real voices in your ears. As if someone's banging on the walls. Like construction machines... But I feel so sleepy. I get up and look out, though. Everything seems normal in the street. When I heard the noises for the first time... I asked my downstairs neighbour and the doorkeeper Arif. - Shall I make you tea? - What tea? What happens in your dream? It's very crowded... Men, everywhere... Everyone is shouting... There's someone at the window. And I'm sweating all the time. It's too hot in this house. Sweating here is normal. Oh, please don't downplay everything I say! I can literally hear the sound of my body sweating. Seems, I've become more sensitive to sounds. I'm making tea. What made you see them I wonder? What? What triggered the nightmares? What do you mean? You can't just start seeing them out of the blue. There must be a reason. Didn't you study this stuff? You should know. I studied sociology, not psychology. Isn't sociology some kind of social psychology? Couldn't the dead save themselves if they wanted? We won't buy that. Some looters took advantage of the dead and tried to create chaos. Our nation is provoked by looters. That's it. Add footage from this second onwards. We won't put law enforcement agencies against our nation. I don't get it at all. Darling, what is it that you want to understand, so badly? - Bimbo wants to see you. - Why? - How the hell should I know? - She can't do anything without me! Write down the ticker: "The People Give their Verdict." Where does he say that exactly? Did he say that? It's not from Muzaffer's speech. Then I won't write it. - What do you mean, you won't? - I won't. Hasret, listen! Bimbo wants it to be written down. So, do it. A bottle of water please. "The People Give their Verdict." The general opinion is that... Huseyin Ugur is provoking the public. This topic kept TwitTurk busy the whole day. But why? Huseyin Ugur's new book Wrong Memory is to go on sale next week. Ugur's invitation to the Cultural Festival incited anger. From his social media account, Ugur said he received death threats... but fears nothing. "He tweeted "Since not everyone has been hit on the head, there's a big problem here. "I wrote my theories about what was deleted from our memory and how." Furkan Muzaffer is speaking now. I'd like to clarify a few issues. The Ministry of Culture has invited Huseyin Ugur to the festival. This is a democratic country. We respect freedom of speech. However, I follow him with great interest. This country is not a bear garden! You can't just write as you please. If you try to fool people with a pack of lies... the writer, the publisher and reader alike will be held accountable. It will be dealt with accordingly. We won't tolerate... disrespect to our values in the name of freedom of speech. Huseyin Ugur had retreated since his last book. He came to Istanbul for the first time in twenty years. A good night from us now. It's sports after the break. Stay tuned. And keep in mind: What you see is true. What you hear is true. HUNDREDS DIE Fuck! So, how will you arrange to see this man? They won't just let you approach him. I go to the park every day. - What happened again? - I seem to remember things. - What kind of things? - Things. What happens there? I'm sure that I have a brain, just don't know how to use it. Talking nonsense again! Maybe you're a little obsessed. Only a park reminds you of stuff? I hate that expression: "You're the man." Right? And then there's "You're one hell of a guy." What does that mean? You're the man. You're one hell of a guy. Bravo! You saved the world! Did I tell you that they renamed our neighbourhood? - Why? - I don't know, it was a while ago. - What did they change it into? - Karamolla. - What does that mean? - Does it need a meaning? It's ten. Come on, let's go. Heathens! They're targeting the mosque! What do you mean you're not coming, love? What will I do without you? No. I won't go there again. It's an event with the Ministry. The governor invited us, dear. Look, there will also be guests from Ankara. It's a festival. We haven't gone for 15 years. I don't get it. You want to go now, for what? So what if a few people called us "heathens"? What else can they do? Everyone's very excited. We have our group ready. We'd be able to say that we sang our songs in our homeland. What on earth is more fulfilling than that? Asif is also happy. He accepted immediately. So did Canan. - Hasret, aren't you asleep yet? - Come on, Hasret. It's ten. Remember... Remember... Remember... Remember... The new voiceover is ready. Shall we? An organised group started a protest against the conditions of the trial. Organised? The group smashed the windows of several shops. Police responded with water cannons. The march caused traffic. You can split the screen and edit. Then I'll come and check it, Okay? - Okay to what? - Okay. Just do it! - There is nothing about the trial here? - That was two days ago. The lawyers tried to make a press conference. We have footage. The attack in the court happened two days ago. Yes, I understand that. The defendants attacked the lawyers of the plaintiffs. The judge threatened to throw the lawyers out. People marched today... because the lawyers tried to make a statement... about "the situation" in the court. They were not allowed. - So, people marched. Today. - This is what happened today, OK! Listen carefully! I don't want to see any social media whatsoever on office computers! If I see anything on your computers... I won't shy away from shoving that computer up your ass! Get it? What? - Ms Terken... - Yes? - I want to go back to documentaries. - You what? Documentary editing. What I do for a living. Oh, great! But you know we don't always get what we want, dear. I know but I'm more efficient there. I suck at news. What's inserting voiceovers over footage got to do with efficiency? It has not. That's the problem. - You have an answer for everything? - Can't you see what I mean? Your choice. Make up your mind. Then let me know. Okey-dokey? - Well, do you see what I mean? - Yes. - Okay. I have to finish a report. Can you send in Mesut? There are hundreds of casualties. Many injured have been taken to nearby hospitals. There was a power cut in town. The reason for the explosion is currently unknown. Furkan Muzaffer will hold a press conference at 7PM. Hello? Watching the news, lots of casualties. Yesterday? I thought it happened today. But Muzaffer didn't make a statement. Huh? I didn't go to work. No. I didn't quit. I'm probably fired. I don't know. RESTORATION OF PASA MOSQUE BEGINS ANATOLIAN SONGS LET US GO, MY LOVE, THIS CITY IS NO GOOD FOR US. BAGLAMA METHODS MY MOM HAS THE SAME BAGLAMA. TO MY LOVE... ANKARA, â€˜77 Ms Canan... There was a festival at our homeland. You went together, right? Are you okay? You went to the festival with my family, right? Are you okay? Please, say something. I called the municipality. Whatever I asked them, they kept saying we don't know. I was told no one from that period works there anymore. At least say something. Don't you remember anything at all? Can you remember the day my parents died? I ask you, are these people Turkish? They can't be Turkish. They can only be called urban thugs. How can you destroy a city? Your destruction is instigation! Your destruction is provocation! Instigation is caused by... Hello? I'm home. I didn't check my phone. I couldn't, Mehmet. Huh? No, I don't want to go out. Okay. Where are you? - Any news from the lawyer? - Nope. - When did you last visit the cemetery? - It's been quite a while. - How long? - A while, I said. Why? Why? No one lives in the village anymore. Shall we go together when I'm back? Everyone calls me to ask about you. I don't know what to say to people. I bullshit every time. Hasret, we all are worried about you. What do you want from us? At least, answer our calls! So that we can do what we are capable of. - Shall we visit a psychologist? - Don't be ridiculous, Mehmet. Does everyone who has a bad dream see a psychologist? Is it just a bad dream now? Please call Gulay and ask her to stay with you. Or you can stay at her place, maybe. Maybe you should come with me. It'll make a change for you, it'll be nice. I don't want anyone. What do you mean? - I don't want anyone. - OK. I said, what do you mean? What do you mean by "I don't want anyone"? What do you want then? I don't want anything. Hasret, don't drive me crazy! I'm doing this for you. - "You're the man." - What? Nothing, Mehmet. Never mind. We'll talk later. OK? Dada didi dada! My beautiful daughter. Mommy, where did we take Hasret today? We took her to the island. There were horse carriages. But then, what happened? Hasret didn't want a ride. Why didn't you, Hasret? Because you always tell stories about horses. Beautiful horses... Those horses at the island were beautiful, too. But not like the horses you told me about. - What were they like, honey? - They couldn't go where they wanted. Hasret and I are composing a great song today. Auntie's sweety. - Good evening. - Good evening, Arif. No garbage. Hasret, don't you work at the news network anymore? - I don't. - Are you looking for a new job? - No. - May God help you. Thanks. Arif, can I ask you something? Don't you think the neighbourhood is too quiet during the day? Well, evacuation time is at the door. Upstairs neighbours left yesterday. It's just the ones at the top and you. Right. Do I have a fever? You are flushed. But I don't think you have a fever. I wouldn't know for sure, though. Maybe you should see a doctor. OK, thanks. Good evening. Let me also talk a little. It's obvious that you've spoken enough. I also criticize that this trial took too long. As a journalist... Sorry, but it was my turn. If you constantly interrupt me... the program will end before I find a chance to finish a sentence. I'm just saying that I agree with the Muzaffer Brothers. Of course, they won't compromise. After all, many people were released. There is no need to take to the streets at every incident... - to disrupt moral disposition. - You're talking about morality? Since the beginning of this, morality... hold on right there. What morality are you talking about? You mean what matters more is the peace of those sitting at home... when other people are getting beaten? Is it normal that such a critical case takes this long? I don't get it! Relax, it'll all be figured out. The musicians were released, that is the strength of democracy, right? You think that problem was also solved thanks to them? You think, they woke up one day and said "Let's solve this problem!"? These are all pre-planned. I have to interrupt at this point, and say that I find you quite aggressive. You find me aggressive? What? - You're very funny. - What are you laughing at? I'm not the aggressive one, you are. - Aren't you gonna get to the point? - What does that mean? - Don't you understand? - You're being aggressive! - Don't you understand? - I'm not the one who's aggressive. Enough. Okay. - I'm Okay. - Okay, my ass! Why are all the windows closed? You don't return our calls! Are you aware of that? I don't know. You don't reply to your e-mails? Mehmet calls you! He is worried stiff. So am I. OUR GOVERNMENT STANDS FIRM AGAINST ALL THREATS - Who am I talking to? Hey! - I'm listening. I'm here and you are looking at the TV! - When was the last time you went out? - I don't know. Look at this mess! - Are you fine? - Fine. How is Oktay and them? You're fine, huh? Screw Oktay! You are not well. Get up now. Let's go, see a doctor. What are you looking at? - Do you smell it? - What smell? - It smells like something is burning. - What burning? - The curtains will burn. - Why would they? Gulay, the walls are too hot... - What are you talking about? - Never mind. You go. - Gulay, can you leave? I'll call you. - Hasret, you are acting very weird. - Why do I need to go now? - Leave me alone. Please. - I want to be alone. I'll call. - Haven't you been alone long enough? I can't leave you alone anymore. Let's go to my place. - I'll call you. Please go. - Yes, you'll call me, but are you hungry? Aren't we friends? What are friends for? - Isn't it time for you to move anyway? - I'll call you. - What about the evacuation? - I'll call you, Gulay. - Call me! This isn't right. You have to call me! Call me, Okay? I'll be back in two days. I'll call you as soon as I come back, Okay? The walls are too hot. You're not well at all! Too hot. The walls are too hot. The walls are too hot. - Hasret, you have to get out! - The walls are too hot. Go to Gulay! I can't come earlier. - The walls are too hot. - Hasret. - Too hot. Listen to me. I'm calling Gulay now. She'll come to you, OK? The walls are too hot. Hasret, get out of that apartment. I'm begging you. - Are you getting out? - Yes. Are you getting out? A beautiful bird had I Loved it so did I Took it with me one day Named it amour have I It was an early bird Rising before us all Loved dearly by us all Kissed and petted by all One day the cage's lock Suddenly lifted its block Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! People inside! Don't look out the window! You are irritating the people outside! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Almighty God! This is your fire. Send it in! Is there anybody out there?
