It's me. Who is a stronger man of the office? That's me. Let's go. (snaps) (computer keys clicking) Are you happy for me? - Why? What have you done this time? - I did girl online. - Are you sure? Just like last time and the time before. Now it's internet dating, really? Told you, it's is not gonna end well. You need to be like me, stability, 20 years. I'm a happy man. That's what you need in your life, stability. - I have a good job. I love my job, you know that. But I know my boss is an asshole. I mean, a piece of shit. - Definitely a piece of shit, both, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't and don't want stability. You're too high flying. You're a playboy. Everything's a joke to you. What's wrong with Theresa, huh? What's wrong with Mary? What's wrong with Patricia? What's wrong with Jennifer? All these girls. - Patricia, she was odd. - She was not odd, you made her odd. It's you, it's just, it's this lifestyle. You need to calm down. You need some stability. Calm it down and you'll meet the right girl. Don't go looking on the internet. - Hmm. You never cheat. - Of course not. What'd you take me for? Anyway, we're talking about you. - You know what? You lie. - No, this is you. This is on you. - You cheat my friend. No way, anyway, cheers. - Wow, cheers. (glasses clink) - For a better life. (mysterious music) Thursday, huh? Show me more. Come on, more. (mysterious music continues) Yes, I'm always ready for a new date. Why not tomorrow for lunch? Bingo, yes. (music plays softly in background) - Hey, Ethan. How are you doing? What are you doing here? - I'm doing well, thank you. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - You're waiting for your date again, I guess. - Yeah. - Yeah. - And this time it's gonna be the right one. - Hmm. Well, you know, all these dates on the internet, I will never understand them. - I know because you are two old school. - Yeah. Well, I've been with my wife for a couple of years and, it's still crazy love, Romeo and Juliet. - Romeo and Juliet. - Mm-hmm. - The story ends badly, right? - Yeah, yeah, it does, but mine is still relevant. - You're a lucky man. - Hello? - Oh. - Are you Ethan? - Yes. - Nice to meet you. - Same. - Would you, well, maybe in the other room would be better. I'll show you, I'll show you the other one. - Glad you came. - Yeah, well, with the net, we always feel that it is a fig, right? - Yes. Is that you, right? - That's me. So what are you looking for? - Well, it's been for over eight months I'm free. - She dumped you? - It's complicated. - Complicated, yeah. Well, I don't want to waste my time. I want something serious, something solid, you know? - Relax, step by step, okay? - Yeah, well just I'm tired of men who only look for one night stand. - I didn't talk about sex. - Yeah, just warning you, that's all. - All right. What are you doing for a living? - I just finishing my degree and then looking for a job. What about you? - I work in the office. - Oh yeah, you like it? - Yeah, of course. - Okay. Well, I just had a really bad week with my boss and my mom and just people so stupid and stuff. - I really love your white shirt, nice. - My shirt, of course. It's my boobs you're looking at. - Are you serious? - Yeah, I knew it, all the same. (Ethan snickering) - You act like my grandmother. - [Date] Your grandmother, really? - Yeah. - Why? - She's so tight, you know? - Tight? Yeah, you know what? Goodbye. - Bitch! - Hey, your girl didn't look happy. All right, I see. - Thank you. - I told you. (alarm clock ringing) (water splattering) (upbeat music) (Ethan whistling) - Ethan, New York has approved a project. Good job, man. (boss clapping) I'm sorry about your holidays, but you're gonna have to cancel them. - I didn't take any plan for holidays. - Oh really? That's why you're the best here, after me, of course. - Of course. Did you think about my salary increase? - Salary increase. (boss snicking) Funny guy. Let me ask you a question, Ethan. Do you deserve it? - Well. - [Boss] Do you? - I guess. - I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. You know, it's a little bit difficult right now, but you'll get there, for sure, okay? - Yeah. - Yeah, keep up the good work. I'll see you later. (computer keys clicking) - Woman, Black Pearl.

I will not reveal your identity, okay? - Have you been dating on this app for long? - Not too much. - Me too. Thank you. - Thank you, Christopher. (music playing softly in background) So what do you want to eat? - I want to eat meat. - Hmm, I'm vegetarian. - Okay. - Meat is a problem with greenhouse effect, you know, pollution. - Oh, really? - Yeah, but it's okay. Eat whatever you want. - Thank you, I guess. So you said that you are working at a office, right? - Yeah, daily routine. - [Black Pearl] I can imagine. - [Ethan] And you? - Well, I'm looking for a job, but a night job because my brother's sick, so I have to take care of him. - It's sad, sad to hear. Hopefully this time you will not throw a cup of water on my face. - What? What for? I'm not wild. - I'm just joking? - I'll be back in a moment. I'm going to the bathroom, okay? - Take your time. (music plays softly in background) - Well, I'm sorry, but I have to go. My brother just called me and he's sick, so. - I hope it's not too serious. - I'll tell you. We'll meet next time. - [Ethan] Free. - I have your number anyway, so. - Okay. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Dammit, Natasha. Can you imagine if I'm naked with a girl? - Ethan, you don't reply to my message. - I should never give you a spare key. - Yeah, but you forgot that I am moving and you had to do some DIY in my new apartment first. - When was that? - Today. - I forgot. I have a lot of things to do in my office. A lot of paperwork. - I can never count on you. I should have hired a renovation company. - Oh really? - Yeah. - I will do it tomorrow, okay, no worries. - If you don't come tomorrow, you will see. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - Now go away, go away. Love you, sister. - Love you too. - Goodnight. My man. - You're all right. Do you want a drink? Do you want coffee? - Yeah, yeah, sure. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Black Pearl. - Black Pearl what? - She disappeared? - Yeah? Well, you know what? Seems to me I've already seen her before in this restaurant, to be honest. - No, she's unique. - No, I assure you, as far as I remember, always around the same time she came. - Oh, wait a minute. - [Christopher] Don't tell me it's her. - Yes. 10:30 tonight. - There, you go, lucky man. - Yeah, I told you, she's unique. I want my coffee, man. - Oh yeah, forgot. - [Ethan] Thank you. (quiet music) - Hey. - Hey. I am happy to see you, you disappear. - Look, my life is complicated. I need time. - I understand. - My brother is getting worse. He might die. - I'm sorry. Too bad. But I will wait for you, okay? But not all my life. - You wanna go for a walk? - Yeah, sure, let's do this. (upbeat music) Sorry, but I'll not eat meat, okay? I love animals and I don't know, for since I was young, I never be attracted about it, you know? - I'll change your mind. - Are you sure you will change my mind? - [Black Pearl] I'm pretty sure, yeah. (Ethan chuckles) - We'll see. But I'm lucky you are beautiful woman. (dramatic music) What are you doing? (dramatic music) (alarm clock ringing) (Ethan groaning) What is this nightmare? (alarm clock clanking) Shit. What have you done to me? Bitch! - Are you kidding me, Ethan? What the fuck? - What do you mean? - We had the meeting with New York this morning and you didn't show up. - I forgot. - You forgot? I looked like a fool because of you. I was lucky that Rebecca knew the file perfectly. - It's Vanessa, by the way. - I don't give a shit, okay? I pay you to do your job, so do it! - Yes sir. I will do my best. - Yeah, do more than your best. Don't ever do that to me again, Ethan. Understood? - Hey, Ethan. How is it going, my friend? Huh? - Not so well. - Not so well? Why, what's the matter? - I'm looking for Black pearl. - Black Pearl, come on Black Pearl. I thought you guys just met. Hey, what's with the glasses? Hey, are you chased by the police or something? - No, she assault me. - Assaulted you? What'd you mean, she assaulted you? Huh? - She bit me, she drank my blood. - She bit and drank your, come on, man, show me. Come on, man. It's just a fucking hickey. Come on, you know, it's a love bite, you know? Hey, what's the matter with you? Hey, how much booze did you drink yesterday, huh? - Nothing, nothing. It wasn't a dream. - Hey man, you're just hungover. Hey, take an aspirin, drink lots of water. You'll be fine tomorrow. - No, it's not hangover. It's something else. If you are my friend, you have to believe me. - Yeah, yeah. I believe you, but Ethan, Ethan. Ethan, come back. Ethan, you're just in love, huh? That's what you are, come on. (mysterious music) - There is something strange with this woman. I met her twice and the last, she bit me. I don't know her real name, actually. - I told you before, the internet is dangerous. Did you go back to the bar where you first met her? - Yeah, apparently she came back with another man. - See, this why this woman is dangerous. She's looking for something. - Oh. Light bother me. (curtain swooshing) - She could be a bloody serial killer for all we know. Single men have gone missing over the last six months. Do you not watched the TV? - I'm sorry, no, I'm too busy at work. Sorry, pal. - You do look a bit pal, unwell. What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna leave you to rest and I'll pop back later, see if you're okay, all right? - I must find out, this Black Pearl. (intense music) - So, you met that woman on internet, right? - Yeah, Black Pearl. - Is it a name? More details? - Just a nickname. Ah, yes, she had a sick brother. - No name, no address. Do you mind taking off your glasses? - No, I'm sorry, I can't stand the light. It's too bright in here. - Okay, you met that woman. You must have a phone number, on email. - Phone is down and she don't reply to any email. - Oh, I see. We have a ghost woman. - Look. She bit me. - Is this a joke? You may have time for joking, but I don't. Maybe a few hours in custody would help you. Sporty man like you supposed to defend himself against a pretty woman or she's Wonder Woman. - She bit me, I pass out and I wake up at home. - Your home? Okay. So you're complaining for a assault committed by a woman that you still don't know without any traces of aggression. Really? I don't like wasting my time, sir. If you're on drugs, you need a rehab or it's gonna be straight to the cell. - I'm not crazy, okay? I'm not feeling good since she assault me. Ask the owner of the restaurant, Christopher Kessler. That's where I have a dinner with her. - If you don't feel well, go see a doctor. - I got mugged. What are the police for? If not, help the victims. - Okay, I'm gonna look into this case more closely, but you have to understand there is no crime and no suspect. It's not gonna be easy. - I'm not a liar. Not feel good. - Got your number. If there's something new, we'll tell you. Have a good day, sir. - You know what? I was sure you wouldn't show up. - I have one word. I'm your brother. - Yeah, yeah, and I really appreciate that. Ethan. - Hmm? - You are hungover. - No. - Yeah? - No. - I'm not judging you. (Natasha laughing) - I think I feel a little bit weird. - [Natasha] Okay. - And I need to see a doctor. On top of that, at work, it's crazy. - Yeah, your boss is a real jerk and I don't understand why you don't resign. Hey, you can trust me. I am not mad. And what about your date? Where did you meet her? Online? - Yes. - [Natasha] And? - I'm not sure, she hurt me, bit me. - You are crazy. Okay, start by helping your sister first. - I need to learn more about women. I'm naive. - I have something for you. I don't need it. - [Ethan] How did you get that? - [Natasha] In the box. - [Ethan] Wow. - It's old memory from grandpa. It's quite big here. Okay. - Family is important. - Yeah. Okay, you can put, it's right here, okay? - Okay, gotta go, bye-bye. - [Natasha] Bye, see you. (dramatic music) - You didn't find that bitch? I know she's saw guys few times. I want to know what she knows about last night of my brother's life. It's not normal. Go back to the bar, okay? (dramatic music) (Ethan breathing heavy) (cellophane ripping) (dramatic music escalates) (birds chirping) - Hey, what's with the sunglasses? - I'm sorry, I'm very sensitive with the light now. - Anyway, picked up this book. I think you are find it quite interesting. It's all about female vampires, lost for all time. - Do you really think this woman is a vampire? - Of course not. - Dammit. (dramatic music) - [Black Pearl Voice Over] I'll change everything. I'm pretty sure, yeah. (mysterious music) (dramatic music) Ethan. (dramatic music continues) Kill him. (men struggling) (man gasping) (dramatic music continues) (mysterious music) (water spattering) (Ethan grunting) (water splattering) (mysterious music continues) Daniel, I know it's early, but I'm losing control. I don't know what's going on. I need your help, please, right now. - Brother, you're getting worse. I know how much you hate hospitals, but you must see a doctor. - I don't have the flu. Everything comes from this woman. You know how much I'm scared of needles. - Talking about this woman, it was on the news last night. Woman matching the same description as Black Pearl is now wanted by the police. - [Ethan] Tell me more. - 25 Year old man found dead in his car. Woman matching her description was noticed nearby. - I think I did terrible things last night. - What do you mean? - I'm a vampire. - What bloody are you talking about? - You have to believe me. I'm not thirsty now. But I can't control my anger. - Ethan, look at me. There's no such thing as vampires. They do not exist. - Please, go away, leave me alone. - Okay, I don't know exactly what's going on with you. I'm gonna find out more about this Black Pearl. You just stay with me, do you hear me? You stay with me. - [Ethan] Go away, go away. (rain pattering) - Right. What time? - Hi. - Thanks, bye. - I'm Detective Dewey. I'm looking for a woman reported for assault. Early 20s, maybe less, mixed race. Does that sound familiar? - Oh, mixed race. Oh yeah, you mean Black Pearl. Yeah, she's been here a few times, but I haven't seen her for a few days. - Black Pearl, you say? You don't know her surname? First name, a credit card taken, maybe? - She was always the the one being invited, you see, so, no, sorry. - Make an effort. You must have checked her ID. - I didn't. - Do I have to remind you that it's illegal to sell alcohol to minors? It will be a shame to have to close down this fine establishment. It turns out you were selling alcohol to anyone. - Hey, come on, Detective, this is not an nightclub, this is a restaurant. Why would I check her ID? She never asked for alcohol in the first place. So, who's the suspect here? Is it me or is it her? - She's the one we're looking for, but so far all I have is a code name, unless you prefer a long existent description matching hundreds of women. - Sorry sir, I really can't help you any more than that. - If you ever see her again, let me know, if of course this Black Pearl does exist. - Yeah, she does, I saw her. - Sorry to have wasted your time and mine. - Have a good day, sir. - Have a good day. (music playing softly in background) (elevator voice speaking indistinctly) - Seriously? You wear sunglasses at the office now. Did you get your ass kicked? - No. I'm here to pick up some documents and I will work on it at home. - What? No, you're gonna stay here and you're gonna work on the New York here. That's what you're gonna do. - You misunderstand me. (dramatic music) - That's not how it works here, okay? I am your boss and I commend you to sit at your desk right now. Okay? - Oh, fuck you. - Fuck me? (boss laughing) No, fuck you, man. You're fired. - You're lucky I'm not thirsty right. - Thirsty? What the fuck are you even talking about? You are completely out of your mind. You're a freak. Can't you see that? Just gather your things. I'll see you on the pavement, sucker. Fuck you. (light mysterious music) - [Natasha] Ethan? I'll change. - Natasha. - Yeah. - [Ethan] You can't come to my house anymore. - Ethan, I don't understand anything anymore. What is it? - You are not going to believe me. Do you remember my date last week? - Yeah, mysterious woman. - Mysterious woman, yes. - What mysterious woman? - She bit and now I'm fucked, fucked. I'm a vampire. - Is this a joke? - No, it's not. Please. Tell mom and dad I love them. - No, it's not possible, Ethan. - [Ethan] No. - You will were able to- - Stay far from me, please. You're not safe here. Go away. - I am scared, call me. - Go! Go! - [Natasha] I love you. - Fucking Black Pearl. I swear I kill you. (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (head bangs) (dramatic music) - Yes, I got him, boss. (mysterious music) (heels clicking) So, you wake up? - What the? Why I'm here? I don't know you. - Do you know Black Pearl? - Yes, this woman is a monster. She made my life hell. - Black Pearl is surly part of a cult. Draining blood from a human body is a cult ritual and you must be part of it because you are still alive. - Me? Being a of a sect? Are you crazy? I'm looking for her too. - My brother died drained of his blood. It's her, for sure. - Oh yeah, I'm sure it is. - You were the last us her. So are you going to tell me where she is? Look, my passion has limit. I'm giving you a chance to tell me everything, then you can leave. - You kidnapped the wrong person. This woman is a vampire and she made me a monster. - You take me for fool. You want to protect your girl. It's up to you. You will stay here without food and without drink. It will help you speak. - I advise you to not stay next to me. - You advise me nothing, okay? What will you do? Turn into a bat and bite me? (kidnapper laughing) Tell me what I want to know. Make it for, yes. - I will get you Black Pearl. (dramatic music) (Ethan grunting) Fucking girl. (Ethan grunting) (Ethan growling) (dramatic music) - Look at this guy. (kidnapper gasping) - No, no, no, no, no! (dramatic music) (kidnapper groaning) (Ethan roaring) - Now, you will believe in vampire, my friend. (dramatic music) - Keep going. You can stay here, keep going. - I told you. do not come back. - Help me. (dramatic music) (Natasha crying) (Ethan sobbing) Okay, this is it. (quiet mysterious music) (footsteps clunking) (somber music) - Ethan, Ethan, is that you? Oh my. You're a monster. - Stay away from me. Do you have good news for me about Black Pearl? - No, not found anything yet. - So, go away. I'm not human anymore. (dramatic music) - You don't wanna do this. You don't wanna do this. - [Ethan] You're a traitor! - Black Pearl chose you for a reason. I don't know the reason, but I will find out, I promise. (Ethan mumbling) This is for my protection only. - [Ethan] Oh! - I won't give up on you, Ethan, I won't give up on you. I will not give up on you, Ethan. I just pray I'm not too late. I pray I'm not too late. (Ethan grunting) (quiet music) (dramatic music) (Ethan roaring) (mysterious music) - [Black Pearl Voice Over] Kill him. - [Runner] Help! Help! Help! (dramatic music) (runner gasping) (mysterious music) (dramatic music) - What the fuck? Cool, man. Who the fuck are you? Stop, stop. (dramatic music) Who are you? - I told you I am a good friend. (dramatic music) (boss yelling) You stink. You're gonna pay up now. (Ethan yelling) - [Black Pearl Voice Over] You're one of us now. We'll meet next time. - Stop. I don't want to hear. I don't want to hear that. (mysterious music) (mysterious music continues) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) At last we meet again. You have to tell me why you are doing this to me and I will kill you. - 200 years ago, your ancestors tracked down the master relentlessly to try to kill him. I have chosen you, Ethan. The less distant have the vampire slayers to enter our family. The master will have his revenge. The one who's stalked is now vampire. - I have nothing to do with it. Give me my life back. - We're not gonna be the last ones. You're one of us now. - I don't deserve it. - Enjoy mortality. It's a precious gift. - No, it's a nightmare.
