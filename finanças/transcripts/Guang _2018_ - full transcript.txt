Did you say it like how I taught you? Yes I did. The exact same way. Then why didn't she hire you? She asked me. What is my favorite flower? What did you answer? I don't like flowers. Why would anyone say that? It's not that Di Di. Flowers are plant genitals. When you give someone flowers. You are actually giving a bunch of genitals. I can't live without it. Amazing brain you've got. You haven't answer me Di Di. Can I get a piano? No. Why not Di Di? You really want a piano? Yes I do. Be a dish washer then. Make some money.

Good day Boss Fang. So have you decided to sell your piano? It's just collecting dust. Might as well sell it. Why? Why are you selling it? I used it to learn music when I was young but I have stopped playing for some time now. So I'm selling it before moving to a new house. Ungrateful woman. What's so funny? Luckily you were fast or else you would have drank some drain water. That's none of your business. I don't even know you. Hello. My name is Wen Guang. I am 27 years old. I am kind. Friendly. And helpful. I may seem a little odd. But I hope you understand. I am autistic. I am Sue Ann. Twenty-four years old. I am a kindergarten teacher. Are you autistic? No, I am normal. Am I abnormal? That's not what I meant. I'm just an ordinary person. You see people like me everywhere. You are special right? The bus is here. Go on. Boss done. Okay thanks. You start first. Why are there still so many left? Hurry up. Are you here to wash yourself? Soap. The soap went into my eye. Why did you put it into your eyes? The soap went into my eye. Go pick up the dishes. You like washing dishes? You look really happy. It's bearable. This is just a temporary job. We still have to work on getting you a proper job. But it's okay for now I guess. Di Di. I have decided. Decided on what? Decided not to buy a piano. How old are you? I am 27 years old. This is the best decision you've made in the twenty-seven years of your life. A piano is pointless. Green light. See for yourself. It's not that bad. At least he can cover some expenses. Let him experience the working world. I think it's a really good start. Why don't you reply her? Seriously though have you considered patching things with her? Do I look like I'm making money? I can't even sort myself out and then there's him. I'm not as lucky as the rest of you. I am tied down for life. A lot of things are unpredictable. But you are the one who is tying yourself. You are the stubborn one. You don't have a choice? He has no choice! Okay. I shall reply and patch things back then. Get married and have a kid. If my child is autistic you shall raise him for me. Okay then. Carry on with your glorious single life. Spend the rest of your life with your brother then. Let's go. I'm done. Wen Guang. Done with your work? Yes, i'm done. Want some fried chicken? Yes, tony. Fried chicken is tasty. It's late, let's go. See you on Sunday. Tony. Are you coming over for Mahjong? You want to play? No. I want to see all of you explode. Okay. See you on Sunday. Cut your finger nails before you sleep. It's getting longer. Cut my nails. Buy yourself some breakfast tomorrow. Where are you going? The aquarium shop. I want to go. What for? To get a fish bowl. You want to start fishkeeping? Cool. Tag along tomorrow then. Thought you would never like what l like. You never like what l like as well. Do I look like I have a short-circuit? If I like what you like. I would be the one washing dishes. Wake me up at eight thirty tomorrow. Hair algae cannot be solved with just plucking. You have to introduce some algae eaters into your tank. What eater? Siamese algae eater. Flying fox. What the fox? Follow me. Go choose a fish bowl. A small one will do. These? These are Siamese algae eaters. Put them in your aquarium, they will eat your algae. But please return them back to me once you done. Or else they will eat all your plants in your aquarium. Is it enough? Trust me. You are my regular customer. I would never lie to you. Is it? How much is it? Forty five eighty. What do you want this for? I need it. You don't need a syphon for such a small tank. I need it. It won't cost you much. Just buy it for him. Exactly. It's cheap. No thanks. I need it. It's cheap. Just use mine if you really need it okay? You promise? Have I ever lied to you? You did. You used up my. 310ml silicone sealant. You said you would buy me a new one. But until now. Okay. If I break my promise this time. I'll chop it off. Chop it off? I'll even put it in a box and tie a ribbon for you. Happy? Now you are going to laugh about this the whole day. Tie a ribbon. Even though it's a tiny fish it's a living thing. You must take care of it. When you feed it just a tiny bit would do. Or else the water will get murky. Understand? I'm talking to you. Yes, i understand. Enjoy your tank while I enjoy mine. Okay. Minus your rent and the utility fees. You can have the rest. It's a norm to treat someone with your first paycheque. Cannot. Why not? Trying to be calculative? Fine, let's lay it out. Your fish bowl. Your fish. Your fish net. Your fish feed and GST comes to a total of forty-five. So would you rather pay me forty-five Ringgit? Or pay for my ice tea and roti canai? Take your time and calculate. Sir bill please. Your orders were two roti canai one ice tea one water. Six fifty. He is the boss. Thank you. Seriously though. You must save up your salary. Yes. Sorry. How may I help you? I need a box. Okay. Three noodles take-away. Okay. Might take a while. Okay. This is the fifth. This will be the last one. Put the smallest one at the back. Wen Guang. Remember me? It's you! I had a big harvest. I went to a second-hand shop and bought all these glasses. All of them can produce specific frequencies. Like this one. F Accurate. And these? 783 G 659 E 1174 D This is about 1000. Almost a C. You can hear them. Do you have perfect pitch? This is a problematic glass to get an exact C. Then I'll probably have to cut some off. Wen Guang. You should eat before your noodles get cold. Soba. 480ml polyvinyl acetate. Good choice. Edible. Non toxic. Look at this. Might solve your problem. Please don't speak Cantonese. You've been in Kuala Lumpur for so long and still can't speak Cantonese. You truly suck. Your mandarin sucks just as much. I just need to know enough to pick up some chicks. One circle tile. Guang. I know a few hot Indian chicks. Want me to hook you up? No need for that Sheldon. I have a girlfriend. Girlfriend? I have a girlfriend. Why don't you introduce your girlfriend to them? Go. Yes. Introduce my girlfriend to them. Stop staring and carry on with the game. It's your turn, he hit one circle. I want the nine circles. One... Two... Three... Four... Five... six... Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. Explode. Explode my ass. Why don't you be a dear friend and hit a tile that's useful for me? I shall do that by hitting the Southern tile. You want that? Wen Guang. Is this your girlfriend? Yes, she is. Her name is Angela. She is 4 years older than me. So you prefer older women? Older woman. How long were you together? Fourteen years and counting. He says she is a Caucasian lady. Blue eyes and blonde hair. Caucasian lady? Yes she is. Guang. I think you should just stick to her then. Do you want the Southern tile? I know you want it. I'll pass. Hurry up I'm about to win. Ladies and gentlemen. Pardon me. Perfect game. How many points is that? Massive explosions. Explode. What's the total? RM 12.50 That little? I'll be right back. How many have you stolen? Sorry... Let's talk calmly. - What's the problem? - Problem? Your elder brother is the problem. He can't even work properly and now I caught him stealing. Can you train this idiot before unleashing him into the wild? Watch your words. My brother is autistic, not an idiot. You want to argue? Let's call the police. Just take the glass back. Why are you fuming over such a small matter? Are you teaching me how to do my job? Why don't you teach your idiotic brother first? Tell him not to come tomorrow. You don't have to as well. You think you are the boss? Watch your back. Don't blame me if you get into an accident. I'll haunt you if I die. Why did you steal? I tried so hard to get you a job. Just a dishwasher and you made a big mess out of it. You could have told me you wanted a glass. And I could have bought it for you. I won't do it again. Crazy woman. Sit. Let's rehearse your lines. It's not that Di Di. I don't want an interview. You are a jobless man. A man with no income. I have to pay for your expenses. Can you use your brain for once and think why must you work? What happens if I die one day? Are you going to be a beggar? Can't you just hold my sack? Follow what I say. Learn your lines and get a proper job. And I will be off your back. Hold on Di Di. What do you mean by hold your sack? Hold. Hold my sacks. Why can't you hold yourself? Why not? That is not what l meant. Can't you just follow what I say and make me happy? Why would you be happy if I hold them for you? You find that funny? Go take a bath and remember to brush your teeth. Hold them for you. It makes you happy. Better not. Di Di. I need acrinol solution. Why would you want that? Because. I got into an accident. Show me. Right here. It's just a minor wound. Just clean it with water. It's not that Di Di. Without acrinol solution it will get infected. It's in the drawer near the TV. Do you want a speedy recovery? Yes I do. Then don't apply drink it. I can't do that Di Di. I would die if I drink it. I'm amazed you know that. Yes. I can't find it. So troublesome. Why is your bicycle here? It's not that Di Di. Cycling is dangerous. I don't want to die. Sometimes l really don't know how to talk to you. Don't leave it here even if you don't want it. I don't want to see it here ever. It's you! Thank you for teaching me how to cut a glass. I can now tune the glasses accurately. Because most glasses have curved bowls. I can now cut them and stack them together. Biggest to smallest. Lowest to highest. Thank you so much. You're welcome. What is this? Interview lines. My younger brother wrote them. That was your interview line? Wen Guang. When you go for interview remember to look into the eyes of your interviewer. So why are you collecting glasses? Because they are all white keys. They can form the scale that l need. I'm short of 2. 1 of them is a bowl. C5 The other is a tiny glass with a diameter less than 5cm. Depth less than 4.5cm. It must produce the frequency of 1976hz one octave higher. You just scared someone. B Eleven o'clock tomorrow? Yes I know. Okay. I'll make sure he is on time. Bye. Guang. Who is that chick in the bus? Sue Ann. She's my friend. Met her a few times in the bus. You have a friend? I have a lot of friends. Those squids on your bed don't count. They are not squids. Shut up, listen to me. I found another job opportunity for you. Go to a cafe at eleven tomorrow. You just have to do some simple tasks. Yes. Let's rehearse your lines. Where did you come from? I came from Rasa. Look at me. I came from Rasa. Do you have any working experience? Yes. What job? Dish washer. No one will hire you if you say that. Just say. I did cleaning services for a pub. Say it. I have never done that. Can't you just pretend? I I worked in. Look at me before saying. I did cleaning services for a pub. Let's start again. Seriously. If he fails his interview tomorrow. Would you consider hiring him as a cashier? He should have no problem doing such a simple task. It's not that l mind your brother's condition. I would help if I can. But as you know. My shop is far away and I'm not there everyday to oversee. I wouldn't be able to keep an eye. Hello. My name is Wen Guang. I am 27 years old. I am kind. Friendly. Helpful. Hello. How may I address you? Hello. My name is Wen Guang. I am 27 years old. I am kind. Friendly. Helpful. Sometimes l may seem a little odd but I hope you understand. I I am autistic. How did you get here? I took a bus. Are you local? No. I am from Rasa. Rasa. Do you have any working experience? Yes. I did cleaning services for a pub. If we decide to hire you you will be working eight hours a day. But sometimes working overtime is necessary. I will inform you soon. I'm hired? We will let you know soon. What do you mean by soon? Why. Why can't you let me know now? I'm not hired? Wen Guang. Let me put it this way. I don't mean to discriminate against you. But as you can see we are running a cafe. You will have to face a lot of people everyday. So I think it's not the best job for you. Very sorry and thank you for your time "RM 1,799.00" Did you say it like how I taught you? Yes I did. I said. Hello my name is Wen Guang. I am 27 years old. Then you must have answered weirdly when they asked you. Yes I did. I answered them properly. Then why didn't they hire you? I don't know. What do you actually know? Tell me honestly, did you go to the interview? Can you calm down? Don't you know your brother is different? So you are saying I'm not trying hard enough? How about this? Work at my shop. It might be far but it's an easy job. Collect money, return balance. He can do it. You are the one who said he can. Right Wen Guang? Did you hear that? You should thank the person who hired you. Thank you Tony. Eat Wen Guang. You better start working tomorrow. Thanks. Eat. Just 1 left. What do you want? B What B are you talking about? There is B inside. These are just rubbish. You're crazy. It's all crushed. Go away. Sorry. I swear his is not bad guy. He is not stealing for the money. He is not normal. You stole these? We can send you to jail for stealing. Sorry, can you please help? You follow me to police station to make report. And you, you can stay. Can you give me five minutes please? Come down when you are done, we'll be waiting downstairs. What happened? I'm asking you what happened? Look at me when l am talking to you. You didn't go for the interview and stole these instead? I did. I went for the interview. You are lying. You obviously didn't go to work today and you came back smelling like garbage. Where did you go? What did you do? Haven't I told you not to take what is not yours? Don't steal. All I want is for you to be more normal. Why is it so difficult? Are all these stolen? I am asking whether you stole all of these? No. Not all of them are stolen. You still want to lie to me? I've tried my best. All these years. I've done everything. I could to the best of my ability. What more do you want? That crazy woman was right. You are retarded. Did you get that? You are an absolute retard. You didn't shed a tear when mom died and now you are weeping over some glasses? Not all of them are stolen. Time to eat. Come out. Come out now. I think he will come back once he calms down. You are at fault too. It's not like you don't understand that he is different. You really crossed the line this time. I'm at fault? I asked him to get a job not to steal and it's my fault? You didn't need to beat him up. I raised him, damn it. I paid for all his food, clothes and shelter. I am at fault? He would have died long ago if it wasn't for me. Can't you just calm down? He is your elder brother. You think I want him as my brother? Because of this idiot. I am destined to fail my whole life. I can achieve nothing with him. Now he has run away. Great. He can do whatever he wants. I am happier than you can ever imagine. Fine. Let's celebrate then. Why are we even driving around? The day has finally come. You are free. Just let him die. I'm sorry. Keep looking. He bought a hole saw and silicone sealant. He said you owed him that. He said he didn't like flowers and kept staring at my door bell. He bought all the fish bowls. Looked like he cried. You know how he acts right? He would pick a bowl up. Make a few clicks. Say some alphabets and some lottery numbers. I never knew what he was saying. He then shouted at me. Scared me. Never met an interviewee like that. He left after that. Maybe he went back to Rasa? You said he took all the coins from the house. Maybe he used it to buy a ticket? Back to Rasa? It's possible. Your old house is still there isn't it? Maybe he went back to live alone without having to look at your face. Possible? She is getting married. No one was living here after both of you moved out? There was. An uncle that I wasn't close to. And you never came back? Why would I? The things I am looking for are obviously not here. Wen Guang's or yours? Of course mine. You actually think he would be interested in this? I thought you can only battle with two devices? Delicious. I'll have another one. I wonder how many times l have to tell you. Come here. Stand straight. Raise your hand. You heard me? Haven't I said it before? Do not leave the classroom during lessons. Haven't I? Must l punish you for you to listen? The other hand. Hurry up. What did you do? I ran out of the classroom. Everyone knows you ran out of a classroom. I'm asking you. Why did you run out of the classroom? To swim in a drain. To swim in the drain? You thought the water was tasty? Stupid. I am just kidding. Kidding? You think it's funny? You are the normal one. Your brother is different. You are supposed to help him instead of bullying him. You are both killing me. You. I know you were gaming. This is all your fault. Di Di. You have grown up remember to remind your brother everyday to brush his teeth. I will. And. When you eat make sure he does make sure he finishes his food. Look at your mom. She is talking to you. From now on you'll have to be the elder brother. When I fall asleep. I probably won't wake again. Mom don't sleep then. And. He is neither a child nor an old man. He has the right to go wherever he wants. They cannot warrant an arrest. Let's stop talking and keep looking. Let's go. Staying here won't help. If we don't find him today we shall continue tomorrow until we find him. They are still ringing in my ears. My mom's last words. She said remind your brother to brush his teeth. Remind him to bathe. Don't let him feel lonely. You were right all along. I cared too little about him. I never really tried to understand what is in his mind. I don't even know why is he collecting all those glasses. I never bothered. I don't even know where he is. "Only you can read the books you write." "Only you can play the scores you write." "You are laughing at the world." "Wondering why nobody understands you." "With torn pants you set out to the world." "With only your personal pleasures in mind." "Always smiling while building your world." "A safe place in your own world." "You are not a monster." "Don't be afraid when shunned." "Don't forsake your happiness." "for the sake of others." "Walk your own path." "A path with no regrets." "Don't be frustrated." "Doesn't matter if you are a monster." "You are not the only piece of abstract painting." "Carry on mumbling to yourself joyfully." "Woo." "The joy you find in this world." "I can only envy." Excuse me. Are you Sue Ann? Yes. I am Wen Guang's younger brother. I would like to ask. Have you seen him lately? The last time I saw him was three weeks ago. What's the matter? He ran away from home. How did that happen? He stole an expensive crystal bowl. The police came. I was furious and threw his glasses away. When I came home that night he was gone. I have been looking everywhere. Every possible place that he might be. Then I remembered he has a friend in you and thought he might have met you. I'm sorry but he didn't. In any case he does. Of course. I will contact you at once if I see him. I will get help to look around as well. Pass me your phone. Has he mentioned anything about glasses to you? Yes he did. Actually that is all that he talks about. Do you know why he is collecting them? That I'm not sure. He only mentioned some notes and frequencies. I'm not sure. This is my stop. Sorry to trouble you. It's no problem. Most important thing is to find him. Also don't give up in finding him a job. I'm sure there is a way. He might be different. But I am sure there is a part of him that the society is willing to accept. Di Di. You promised me that day to lend me your syphon. You promised me. I need it now. You also said if you don't lend it to me you'll have to chop it off. I need it now Di Di. It's in the same drawer, you can have it. Wen Guang. Head to this customer's home tomorrow. You know how? Yes. Get a RM 1.40 train ticket. Disembark at Awan Besar. Take bus number 18 and I should be there. How's your progress here? I have done 104. 74 left. I'll leave you to it then. Let's go. Help me out with this. What have you been up to? Tuning pianos. Even a ghost knows you are tuning pianos. I'm asking whether are you on a big project collecting stuff behind my back? Not yet. If you do you'll have to tell me. I will tell you. Your friend Sue Ann. What do you think of her? Di Di. Amongst my many friends she's the hottest. Why don't you tackle her? I can't do that. I'm already with Angela. I am a loyal man. You understand? I understand. I shall tackle her then. Di Di. Why would you do that? Since you don't fancy her. I shall give it a try. It's not that Di Di. Think about it. One day. You will get married. If you had RM 10 by then you will be left with RM5. And after she gives birth to three babies you will be left with only RM2. When you go broke do not borrow from me. There are things that you will never understand no matter how much I explain. There are also things that you will never understand no matter how much I explain. If I fully understand what you are talking about. I'll be the one having a short-circuit. Short-circuit In my imagination. All my dolls have gotten A for their Further Maths. Your younger brother said you bought a scale for over a thousand Ringgit? Yes. Isn't that overspending? It's not, i need it. For what? I need it for my glue. What glue? Epoxy grout. Have you thought of modifying this camera into infrared camera? No. I bought a second hand digital camera. I then grinded a panel of clear glass. I took it to the shop to remove the hot mirror filter in the camera and replace it with my glass to allow all range of lights to enter. I can then shoot infrared photos and shoot everything with it. So these are an extra octave. No. C C G C G C C G C E C G C E C Do you understand what I'm saying? Okay. Forget it. Cut. How was it? Good? Approved?
