[VOICE FADING]Repeat: Lost team leader. [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] [CHAIN SAW BUZZING] [MACHINES WHIRRING] [MATTEO] Watch it. [THUNDER CRASHES] [BELL RINGING] [MUMBLED CONVERSATION] [MELANCHOLY MUSIC CONTINUES] [ECHOING VOICES] Whoo! Hey. Hey, beauty. [ANGIE LAUGHING] [HELENE] Such a good girl. Angie. -[JOHN] Whoa whoa whoa. -[ANGIE COOS] [JOHN] It's a fish. [LAUGHING] [JOHN] Go! -[JOHN] Angie, smile. -[CAMERA CLICKS] -You quitting? -I gotta keep moving. Well, you're leaving me short. So, this is what you get. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] -[IN ROMANIAN] Bucharest? -[WOMAN] Yes, of course. [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Well, well, well. What do we have here? The Sindikheth and Consociation all gathered here together. Must be a super special occasion. [CAMERA CLICKING] Like one of those weddings where all the relatives you forgot you had show up to the free buffet. Is that what this is? A joining of two spirits? How sweet. [WHOOPS] Look at this. My favorite breakfast. This one comes with a present. Keeps you going all day. So, who's the lucky bride? [ROMAN SPEAKS IN SERBIAN] [FISCHER] What did you say? That's no way to talk to a lady. [ROMAN SPITTING] You fucking son of a bitch. Get the fuck up! Spitting on my shoe, huh? -[FISCHER] Move! -[HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Sorry I didn't bring flowers, eh. [CAMERA CLICKING] [AGENT, IN DUTCH] Come on, stand up. -[SABAN] Tell me. -Interpol was waiting for us. -[SABAN] And the shipment? -[BER] Gone. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] [ROMAN] Watch it, man. Watch it. Do you have any idea how hard it is to get blood out of Italian calfskin? [ROMAN] No. Why don't you try some water, huh? Oh, you're an expert now? [FISCHER] Don't be a girl. [SHIRA] Okay, Roman. That's a shipment off the streets. But it doesn't put us any closer to the big players. Actually, it does. So take the win, Shira. Hitting the Consociation and the Sindikheth at the same time puts a pressure on them while they're trying to link up together. Boss, we could get a medal for this shit. Fine. But I want the whole Consociation, not its droppings. I know it's personal. But I promise you, this was just a warm-up. Now we crank the heat and we force them to make a mistake. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [ANNOUNCER, IN DUTCH]The train to Dordrecht, Lage Zwaluwe and Roosendaal, scheduled at 8:31 p.m., departs from platform... [PAUL] Yeah, Nick, let me cut to the chase. So, it's an ERC20 blockchain called Taltos. Every database will be using it within two years, and now for a small no-risk investment you can get in on it now. Uh, just 15 million euros. I know [CHUCKLES] I know they've been telling that crypto's been dead for years, but, hey, the only place it's going is up. Oh, come on, Nick. Help me make the ICO. You'll be glad you did it. Okay, I guess we'll have to see how you feel about that when you see me cruising by in a new Bentley. Right. [LAUGHS] Okay. Okay, thanks. Thanks, talk to you later. [SIGHS] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC SWELLS AND STOPS] [DOORBELL RINGS] -I'm looking for... -[ANGIE] You're so tall. Can you get a cat out of the tree? Can you dunk a basketball? Is Helene Meyers home? Meyers... [ANGIE] Mommy! Mommy, there is somebody at the door! [HELENE] Who is it, sweetheart? [ANGIE] I don't know, but he's big. Hey. Where have you been? [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] Angie, do you remember Matteo? -He's a friend of your dad's. -Paul? -No, honey, your dad. -You knew my real dad? He was my best friend. Did he like broccoli? -No. -I knew it. Well... Don't stand there like a lug. Come inside. I'll make some coffee. [KETTLE WHISTLING] His name is Paul. We got married last year. He's been good to us. We missed you at John's funeral. [WHISPERS] Yeah. I wanted to come. -But... -I know. We all lost a lot that day. It's just that... You were like his brother. Always there for him. It would have been nice if you could have been there for us when we needed you. Anyway, it's good you're here now. I came because... there's something I needed to tell you. What? -It was my fault John died. -No, stop. -I wasn't fast enough. -I said stop. -It should have been me. -Shut up! You don't get to come here, not after I moved on, and make me relive my grief. Look at me. You don't get to do that. Not when you couldn't even be bothered to show up for his funeral. What kind of brother does that? [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] I'm sorry. -[DOOR CLOSES] -[WHISPERS] Fuck. [HELENE] Matteo. Do you have anywhere to stay? I'll find something. I'll be fine. We have an extra room, so come back inside. Please. [SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [SABAN] What is this? It's mushroom stew, sir. One of our most popular dishes. This is the famous mushroom stew? Why isn't anyone else having it? How many times are we gonna have this conversation? I'm gonna give you another month. Okay? One more month. And then maybe I bring in a new chef, a new menu. Yeah? Think that's fair? -Anything else, sir? -People. Ha! I'd like some people. People. Go. [CHEF] Thank you. [HELENE] That was a good day. -Yeah. -It's for you. Thanks. [HELENE] You know, I kept all his things. His clothes, medals, everything, so... if you need anything, take it. He would have liked that. Matteo. It really is good to see you. It's just that... I'm sorry it took so long. -[ANGIE, MUFFLED] Matteo! -[CHUCKLES] And now you're gonna have to deal with your new best friend. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. [ANGIE, MUFFLED] Matteo? [BER] See these two? They are running the whole investigation. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Taking pictures? I spoke to our Mr Nay. We both agree that whether this rat is in my house or in his house, we don't continue business until it's found. -Mmm, yeah. -Now, if it is in my house, it's up to you two to find it. Fast. [DOOR CLOSES] -Hey. -Hey. -How was your day? -Well... Where's the hobbit? There. [ANGIE, MUFFLED] There you go. Why is she having a tea party with a giant? That's Matteo, John's friend. He stopped by today and I don't think he's got anywhere to go, so I thought maybe we could take him in for a few days. Of course. [PAUL] I think we should get him a new chair. He's gonna break that one. [LAUGHS] [DAISY BARKS] [HELENE, MUFFLED] Santé. [PAUL, MUFFLED] Cheers, everybody, it's a real honor. [ANGIE LAUGHING] [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] [SPEC-OP, OVER RADIO] Message to return. Target two miles. Target number Alpha Bravo 1-0-0-4. Over. [MATTEO] Copy that. [JOHN] You remember that girl at Cappie's retirement party? [MATTEO] The one in the blue dress, you mean? [JOHN] That's the one. Skylar. You pretended you were too drunk to dance. [MATTEO] I don't dance. [JOHN] Why? Are you too tall? You think you'd look stupid? -[MATTEO] I've seen you dance. -[BOTH LAUGH] -We're in position. Ready to go. -[SPEC-OP] Copy that. [JOHN] Look, all I'm saying is that when we get back home, you oughta give that girl a call. Take her out for dinner. -That's Helene's idea, isn't it? -[JOHN] No. No, no. Did she say something about it too? Just that if I didn't call her, I was gonna die alone. [CHUCKLES] I fucking love that woman. She went straight for the jugular, huh? She just wants you to be happy. -Tell her I am happy. -[JOHN] You tell her yourself. But I bet she loves it when you're out in the field, huh? Instead of hanging around the house. At least when I'm out here, she can't hound me about building those gazebos in the back yard, man. [MATTEO] Oh, there we go. Target in sight. -By the way... -[MATTEO EXHALES] -Helene's pregnant. -[SHOT FIRES] Couldn't you wait until after the shot? [SHOT FIRES] -I thought you wanted to know. -[TWO SHOTS FIRE] -Any idea who the father is? -[THREE SHOTS FIRE] I got a pretty good idea. [MATTEO] Coast clear. Bravo, move in. -You fucker. -[SPEC-OP 1] Bravo moving in. [SPEC-OP 2]We've got the assets. [SPEC-OP 1] See you at the rendezvous point. [JOHN] You give that Skylar girl a call. [MATTEO] I'll think about it. [JOHN] You think about it? There's nothing to think about. -You do it when we get home. -[MATTEO LAUGHS, SOUND FADING] [HELENE] Angie? You coming to bed? Come. -I like him. -You do? Me too. [ANGIE] He's been alone for a long time. I think he needs a new friend. [SNICKERS] You're right, honey. -[IN FRENCH] Goodnight, honey. -[IN FRECH] Goodnight. [PAUL] There you go, buddy. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] -[PAUL SIGHS] -[BIRDS SINGING] Bet you've seen beautiful skies all over the world, huh? You got a favorite spot? Afghanistan. Seriously? The night there is quiet. It's... peaceful. [PAUL] Must be hard, coming home with nothing left to fight for. There's always something to fight for. Yeah. Of course. Good talking to you. Goodnight. He's not gonna pee on the carpet. [LAUGHS] No. -But he's just like... -Like what? Uh... I don't know. I was just trying to find a nice way to say "like he's damaged." You know... John never could talk much about it, but... the things they did, they saw over there, they deal with it different than us. Okay? So, try and cut him a little slack. Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just a little, uh... What? Intimidated? Hey, cut me some slack, will you? He's a ghost from your past, so maybe I am a little bit. Well, you shouldn't be. 'Cause I'm not looking back. I'm moving forward. It's all I want to do now. I hope it's not all you want to do. [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] I'm late. I can't do this every day. [DAISY WHINING] [ANGIE] Will you take care of Daisy for me? Yeah. Will you be here when I get back? I don't know. Then we can have another tea party. -[MUSIC STOPS] -How can you say no to that? Thank you. Bye, Daisy! [DAISY WHINING] Yes, James, you can count on that of course. Uh... Let me call you right back. Okay. -[PAUL] Gabriel. -Paul. [PAUL] Hey. -Well, please. -Sit down. Uh, can I get you something? Coffee, tea, Dr Pepper? No, caffeine upsets my acid reflux. Well, you coming here isn't exactly good for my acid reflux either. -What's going on? -I don't know, Paul. I was hoping you could tell me what's going on. -What is this? A riddle? -[SABAN] Yes, it's a riddle. And the riddle is: What the fuck happened to my 15 million euros that mysteriously disappeared from my accounts, Paul? -Oh. -Oh. Uh... Let me check it out. [PAUL] Uh... Okay. Okay, yeah, now... Okay, I see it. Uhm... There were some complications and I should have let you know. [SNICKERS] Complications? With my money. What kind of complications? Well, this uh... This software we're using, uh, it updated itself. And, uh, now there's a damn glitch. Something to do with routing numbers and time zones. It's all over my head, really, but basically it stopped tracking our encrypted transfers in real time. Could you get me someone over at ZeroTech, please. Yeah? -[PAUL] I'll have it fixed ASAP. -Oh good, okay. So it's just me being paranoid here. We're fine? The money's all there, you just can't see it right now. See? No, Paul, I don't see. That's the problem, you know? But I like you. And I know you'd never fuck me because... that would make you crazy. [STAMMERS] I'll get it fixed by tomorrow. -Tomorrow? -[PAUL] Yeah, that's right. No more complications. No more, and if there are, uh... then I'll have bigger issues to worry about. [SABAN] No. No, Paul, you wouldn't have bigger issues. No. You wouldn't have any issues. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [SABAN] This your family? God, that is a handsome woman. Handsome. You know, we should have dinner one time. We've never done that. -No. -I got a good place. You like mushroom stew? Alright, well, then tomorrow. [PAUL] Good. Don't fuck up, Paul. [SABAN] You, come on, leave the girl alone. I don't like coming here, with Interpol watching and everything. [SABAN] How are we gonna know who they're watching? [BER] Yeah, but still, puts you at risk. -That's why I have you. -I guess. Did you get her number? Yeah. You want it? [BOTH LAUGH] [OMINOUS MUSIC CONTINUES] [SABAN, MUFFLED] Take me back to the Reineart. [ENGINE STARTS] [MUSIC SWELLS AND STOPS] What are you making? A doghouse? -A tree house? -Hm-mm. A monkey house? -No. -Can I help? [HELENE] Not until you do your homework. Hi. -What are you doing? -[MATTEO] Keeping my hands busy. I don't like sitting still. Gotta keep moving. You need to keep busy or to keep moving? Because, you know, it's not the same thing. -Yeah. -[HELENE] Hey. It's okay to slow down once in a while. And this is a place as good as any. [BIRDS SINGING] You know what? Let's go out. Come. -Hey, Matteo? -[CAMERA CLICKS] [HELENE] Beautiful, huh? Yeah. "Remember death." I remember when you guys got those. You thought you were so badass. Don't you think it's kind of morbid? Why not "remember life"? Yeah. Come. Don't be afraid, silly cat. [ATTENDANT] Hey, welcome. Have a seat. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [ANGIE LAUGHS] [MATTEO] Whoo! Look at your mom. Hi, Mommy. [GIGGLES] [MUSIC FADES OUT] Earth to Moonbase 2, hello? Anyone? What? You've been in your own world since you got home. You didn't hear a thing Angie told you about her day. -I heard her. -But you weren't listening. She's a smart kid, Paul. She knows when you're not paying attention. Yeah, I'm sorry. Uh... But I've been trying to figure out this accounting error at work. You know how I get. -Oh, yeah. All Beautiful Mind. -[LAUGHS] Hey, you wanna talk about it? You wanna talk about liabilities and equity with me? Mmm... Not if I don't have to. Aww... [CHUCKLES] [EXHALES] [SHOWER TURNS ON] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [OMINOUS MUSIC CONTINUES] [BICYCLE BELL RINGING] [CHURCH BELLS CHIMING] [TOUR GUIDE, IN DUTCH] Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this beautiful tour through Amsterdam. [IN ENGLISH] Also called "the Venice of the North," where we have 165 canals and 1,281 bridges. [BOYS BLOWING ON PARTY HORNS] The Magere Brug is one of our oldest, first built in 1691 where two sisters lived on opposite banks. This can be seen on your left-hand side. [TOUR GUIDE] After this bridge, on your right, -we have the famous... -[SCREAMING] [CAMERA CLICKS] -[WOMAN] Oh my God! -[SCREAMING] [SABAN] So, I guess we can continue our business then. Yes, Mr Nay. [LOUD DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] Tell me something. What do we know? Not much. -Did he flip Paul? -[BER] He couldn't say. My money, Interpol, a fucking rat. No way it's a coincidence. Maybe next time don't cut out his tongue before he's done answering my questions. [BER] You crazy fuck. You think that's funny? Don't make faces. [SABAN, UNDER HIS BREATH] Goddammit. [NORMAL VOICE] I need my fucking pills. [OFFICER IN DUTCH] Sorry, people, the bridge is closed. [IN ENGLISH] Sorry, guys, the bridge is closed. [FISCHER] What the hell. It's Roman. Yes, I see that. [ANGIE] Bye, Daisy! [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] It looks to be a bad day for a new crypto-currency, Taltos. [PHONE BUZZING] Gabriel, I was just about to call you. [SABAN] I need some good news, Paul. I'm having a very, very stressful day. In fact, my doctor standing in front of me tells me I have too much anxiety, I need to relax. Actually, there has been another complication. No! No, no, no, no, no. There's no complication. There can't be, because yesterday in your office you told me you'd have my money today. You remember this, yes? Of course I remember. But it's proven to be a bit more of a problem than I thought. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Saban, you're there? You still there? No, Paul, you did not lose me. I wanna know where the fuck my money is that you're supposed to be watching over. -You just got to trust me. -[SABAN] Trust you? "Trust me" is what people say before they sneak up behind you and they cut your fucking throat. That's a lonely way to live. [SABAN] It's the only way I live. Do you know why, Paul? Because betrayal is around every corner, Paul. It's in every shadow. Find my money. [STAMMERS] Gabriel, I can fix this. I just need more time. Okay? [LOUD DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, come with me. -[ZEEB] What's up? -We have to visit a friend. Alright. [ZEEB WHISTLES] [WOMAN ON TV] ...second quarter. I'd love to call what's happening to Taltos a rug pull, but the market looks to pick up over the next few months. -I don't have months. -[WOMAN] The summer, however, has been cruel to the whole crypto market. By extension, the crypto-currencies have also been severely impacted. [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] [FISCHER] You think Saban's sending us a message? No, what makes you say that? Well... First, hanging the body here, in a public place. And second... You're fucking with me. Of course it's a message, you jackass. Or he would have stuffed him in a barrel of concrete and dumped him off a boat. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hey, stop! Stop. Stop. Open it. -[TELEPHONE STILL RINGING] -[FISCHER] Come on, come on. -[RINGING STOPS] -Fuck. Well, at least we know it works. Let's go back to the office. Naomi in Cyber owes me a favor. Ooh, Naomi. She still single? -[SIGHS] -What? Are you jealous? Did you get stung by a bee? No. This is just my body. But does that hurt? [MUFFLED GUN SHOTS AND YELLING] Sometimes. I need to tell you a secret. [PEACEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hey. Hey. Hey, uhm, I need to sweet-talk some investors tonight so I don't know how late I'll be. You know it's pizza night, right? Yeah, I know. I know. Uh, save me a slice. Okay. Bye. [LINE RINGING] [UNDER HIS BREATH] Come on. Come on, come on. [RECORDED VOICE]It's Roman. Leave a message. It's Paul Woodley here. Uhm... I'm ready to deal. [CHURCH BELLS CHIMING] [ANGIE HUMMING] [ANGIE] I have something for you. Do you like it? Yeah, I love it. [ANGIE HUMMING] I know you're probably ready to get moving again, but... stick around, okay? I think John would want you to get to know his daughter. Pretty face. [LAUGHS] [ANGIE] Mommy, can I have a slice right now? [HELENE] Yes, of course. But watch the road. [ANGIE] I'm just like Matteo. [MATTEO GROANS] -[SKULL 1] Oooh... -[SKULLS LAUGHING] [SKULL 1] Look at this goon. As big as an ox. Break him. -[SKULL 2 GRUNTS] -[SCREAMING] -Matteo! -[HELENE] No!

Oh, fuck. Give me your phone. Give me your phone! [MAN, IN DUTCH] Hey, that's my bike. [HELENE] Give me your phone! [MAN, IN DUTCH] Hey, that's my phone! [PHONE BUZZING] -Yeah, hello? -[HELENE] They took Angie. Hey, okay, slow down, slow down. Where are you? I don't know. They took her. -Paul, they took Angie. -I'm on my way. Son of a bitch! [ANGIE, MUFFLED] Matteo, help me! -[PEOPLE SHOUTING] -[TIRES SCREECHING] -[MATTEO GROANING] -[CAR HORN HONKING] -[CYCLIST, IN DUTCH] Goddammit! -[TIRES SCREECHING] [ANGIE SCREAMING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SKULL] We have to split up. -[WOMAN YELPS] -[MATTEO] Move! -[ANGIE SCREAMS] -[TIRES SCREECHING] Hello, Gabriel. I told you I needed some time. I told you, Paul. I don't like complications. You better let her go, you son of a... [PAUL] Ah, goddammit! [MATTEO GROANING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [ANGIE SCREAMS] Mommy.

Get him off! -[SKULL CRIES OUT] -[PEOPLE SCREAMING] -Where's the girl? -[ZEEB GROANING] [MATTEO GRUNTS] -[JOHN GROANS] -[LAUGHS] Good job. [JOHN] Come on. [GROANS] [MATTEO] Why are you still doing this, old man? [JOHN] You calling me old? [MATTEO] I'm talking about this. This life. You got a wife. A kid on the way. [JOHN] Enough, enough. -[CHUCKLES] [PANTING] No, seriously. I know what you mean. Listen, we're family. You, me, Helene. And that kid, man. It's scaring the shit out of me how soon it's gonna be here. You're gonna be a dad. Anyways, we're family. So are they. And they're family too. And we are all each other's got. And we are all that stands between war and home. It's us. Yes, sir. And that's noble. [MONITOR BEEPING] [GROANS] [DETECTIVE, IN DUTCH] I have to question him. [DOCTOR, IN DUTCH] When he wakes up. Why aren't you out there trying to find my baby girl? -They're trying their best. -Are you? [SHIRA] We've got this. Agent Brasel, agent Fischer, Interpol. -I have to call my captain. -She already knows. Ms Woodley, getting your daughter back is our top priority. We're setting up checkpoints all across the city. A scooter won't get through without us searching it. But I do need to ask him some questions. [MAN, IN DUTCH] Wait. Wait! [MATTEO BREATHING HEAVILY] Think I could get some clothes on first? You got somewhere you need to be? [MATTEO] Yeah. Gotta get Angie back. How are you gonna do that? I'll start by doing your job and find the people who took her. Those two guys you turned into headstones were both Consociation. You thought this had something to do with me. You're the unknown factor. No driver's license, no home address, no cellphone, no bank accounts, no fingerprints on file, not even a file really. Except a name. Matteo Donner. And some redacted military service. Nothing but a passport. What's the Consociation? It's like the NATO of organized crime. An international alliance of extortionists, murderers, counterfeiters, you name it. And when you attack one, you attack all of them. The branch that took Angie is run by Gabriel Saban. [STAMMERS] What do they want? Money? We're not sure. This isn't their usual MO. Jesus, what is their usual MO? Young girls no one will miss. Snatch them off the streets, drug them, ship them all over the world. But never a girl as young as Angie. Not in this city and certainly not so loud. So it's personal. You tell me. I don't know these guys. But I'll go make some introductions. Keep talking like that and we'll see if these still fit. Calm down, big guy, we all want the same thing. So let us do our jobs. You've created enough of a mess. But if any of you know anything, now is the time to say so. We're monitoring your home, phones, internet. We'll know if they make contact. What are we supposed to do, just sit around and wait? [FISCHER] Listen, I know this is hard, but I need you to trust us and stay calm. How can I be calm, knowing my little girl is out there terrified and alone? How? -Come on. -Tell me. [PAUL] Come on, let's go home. There's nothing we can do here. [PAUL, WHISPERING] Calm down. It'll be okay. So you can reach her when you're about to do something stupid. [PAUL] Thank you. [BABY CRYING] This is all connected, isn't it? Roman, Saban, the girl. I don't know. But we're gonna find out. Letting him walk out of here is like... putting a wildcat in your pants. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC SWELLS AND STOPS] [DOOR SQUEAKING] [FISCHER] Bye. [MUTED DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] [SNIFFLES] [SABAN] Hi. What do you say when someone says hello? -Ber. -[ANGIE SOBBING] Are you scared of that big guy? I am. I'm Gabriel. I know you're afraid, but you don't have to be. You're gonna go home really soon, okay? Okay? [SABAN] Talk. [BER] Lo said that Interpol was at the hospital, but the Woodley's didn't go with them. I don't think Paul told them anything. Okay, good. The Consociation wants the Sindikheth's access to Thailand. We cannot lose that, do you understand? [ANGIE, SOFTLY] I wanna go home. What am I gonna do with this kid? [BER] I don't know. Maybe we can give her to the Thais. -Ber, what's wrong with you? -[SNICKERS] It's actually not a bad idea. They like that kind of thing over there. [SOBS] Do you want some juice, sweetheart? A little juice? [PEACEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [JOHN] We've been talking about that we wanted to ask you if you wanna be our daughter's godfather. Are you serious? [JOHN] It means, if something happens to me, then you're gonna watch over her. I'd be honored. That's good, because, uh, everybody else I asked said no. [LAUGHING] We're family. [PAUL] Here. -This will help you calm down. -I don't want to calm down. -Drink some water. -No. [FOOTSTEPS SOUNDING] -Do you know the combination? -What are you doing? There's only one way to get Angie back alive. -I have to go get her. -What do you mean, go get her? Six twelve, it's six twelve. It's her birthday. [PAUL] Hey. Hey, whoa whoa whoa. You heard what that Interpol agent said. She said Saban's got men everywhere. Right? He's like this Eurotrash fucking Tony Montana who's in bed with one of the most ruthless gangs in Thailand. And if you attack one of them, you attack them all. They're gonna kill us, our friends, everyone we know. Everyone we know! How do you know he's connected to the Thai? The agent. She called it the NATO of organized crime. She didn't say anything about the Thai. I don't know, man. You've got a concussion. -[HELENE] What's going on? -He knows who took Angie. -What? [SCOFFS] -Why didn't they ask for ransom? -How the hell should I know? -Where is she? -I don't know! -[HELENE] Stop! -[PAUL MOANS] -Stop! [MATTEO] Where is she?! Where is she?! Okay, okay, okay. It's my fault. It's my fault. [GROANS] You knew? [HELENE] Where is she?! I don't know. I swear to Christ, I don't know. Why did they take her?! 'Cause I took their money and now they want it back. -Give it back to them! -I don't have it. -How much?! -15 million euros. [HELENE] So we just let them take her?
