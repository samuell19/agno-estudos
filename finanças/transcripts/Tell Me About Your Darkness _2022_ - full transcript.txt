TELL ME ABOUT YOUR DARKNESS Bilal, let's not leave your brother alone. Look what happened when we left your brother alone. I will come, too. I will not leave him alone. They could not take care of my son. They could not. They said he died. What was wrong with him? Doctors could not do anything either. Mom, what could the doctors do for a dead man? - What can they do, bring him back to life? - Don't say that! "God, forgive me!" But you're arguing with the men. My condolences. You can carry the deceased inside. I will rest a bit. I'll be in soon. Mom, calm down, please. You've already said everything to everyone. Do not call me "Mom." I am not your mom. - Mom. - Mom. Shut up! You're not letting me grieve. When I die, you will be calm. Is that something you should be saying right now, Mom? It is a sin. Such things are not said in the presence of the deceased. Come on, take the stretcher inside. Okay. Wash my son beautifully and with the best care. If you are doing something for someone else, do more for my son. Many statesmen and factory owners come to us. I just washed our department chief the other day. We do not do any favors. We do what Islamic rules require. You may be an important person, but that's over when you're on the table. There are no privileges for us. I do not treat anyone differently. I wash everyone the same way. Here is the delivery paper. The deceased, Veli Bağdatlı. Mother's name, Satı. Father's name, Ahmet. Cause of death, heart attack. Is that correct? Correct. - My condolences. - Thank you. Thank you. Cengiz? Yes, brother? Cengiz, can you ask them to save a beef sandwich for me? Sometimes they do not have any left. I want to eat so bad. Okay. Good luck. Thanks. What is your relation to the deceased? I am the brother. They're his mother, his aunt, and his wife. Okay then, let's start. Men stay with the deceased male. Oh, sure. Ahu, get out. Come on, Mom. Nermin? Come on, Ahu. We'll go, Bilal, but... Mom? I will not leave. I will not leave my son alone on his last journey. I'll stand in that corner and pray silently. Come on, you know better than that. While a man's body is being washed, there can't be any women present. It is a sin. I am his mother. How can it be a sin? I'll turn my face to the wall. I gave birth to him. Do not make me talk. God forbid! Come on. I said it's a sin, what else can I say? I will show your son, then I will do my job. Well, I am his wife. I guess it would not be a sin for me. Listen to her words... You're not ashamed at all. Will we learn the whole process from you anyway? It is a sin for you, too. Mom, please. Come on. Come on, Mom. Come on, Nermin. There is a mint ointment over there. This one? Guys rub it into their nostrils to avoid the bad smell. It is not something everyone can handle. After all, I got used to the smell during my childhood. When is the deceased's funeral? Tomorrow afternoon. Isn't it late? I am fast. I'll have him ready for this afternoon. No, no. There are people coming from out of town. Well then, let the deceased stay in the morgue, and let me wash him tomorrow. You will bury him with the rose scent still on him. No, brother. My mother wants my brother to spend his last night at home. Oh, of course, it's up to you. It would be better to bury him after being washed. Anyway, it is up to you. In fact, if would be better if we had some hollyhock to wash him with. It is the old-fashioned way. But I use a nice-scented white soap. It is good too. Oh, my son, oh! I could not see your happiness. I wish I did. I wish I died... and you lived. The last time you came to us, he was fine. He didn't look sick at all. Was he taking his medicine? Yes, he was. Sometimes he forgot. You know, I had to check on his medicine. But I was always keeping track. - Like when? - Morning and evening. No, I mean when did he have a heart attack? Ahu, are you questioning me? No, just curious. I am just curious about how it happened. He had a football match with his friends in the evening. When we talked during the day, he asked what I was going to cook for dinner. I made stuffed vine leaves the day before. You know, Veli loves them. I mean, he loved it. He used to say that I could not do it like his mother, but then he would eat the whole pot. What should my child do? You only made stuffed vine leaves, so he ate them all. He's used to his mother's table with full courses, from soup and salad to dessert. Oh, my poor boy! I said there were stuffed vine leaves. He was happy, he said he would buy yogurt on the way. He said he had a football match and he would have a small snack before. He said he would not go with an empty stomach. You know, he has low blood sugar when he's hungry. It makes him angry. Then, arguments. What is the connection between my son and the match? He was playing, Mom. He played with his teacher friends once a month, if not once a week. I have never understood what a person with heart disease has to do with a football match. I do not understand. Me, neither. But you know Veli is stubborn. I mean, he was stubborn. Recently, he has also been interested in rejuvenation. Of course, that has an effect too. Anyway, the stuffed vine leaves just needed to be cooked. You know, he didn't like cold stuffed vine leaves. But he didn't like them hot either. He wanted them warm. If it wasn't exactly what he wanted, that plate would end up in the garbage. The deceased had special tastes. God rest his soul. God rest his soul. Anyway... As I said, I put it on the stove to warm it up. Nermin, did you make them with pistachio on that afternoon we gathered at your place last time? It was amazing. I have been meaning to ask you for a while, "What did you add to this?" No, it was plain. I don't like pistachios. Oh! What were the crunchy things in it? Ah, you mean this? I roast the rice. It sticks to the pan a little. It tastes more delicious. - She does not say that she burnt it. - That's the first time I've heard that. And then? Then I add the spices. I am not talking about that. You were talking about Veli. Her mind is on eating. Mom, did I start the conversation? Do not talk to me. Anyway, it was about 8:00 in the evening. I thought I would make some salad. He called while I was peeling vegetables. He did not like the skin of tomatoes. They got stuck in his throat. He said, "I'm leaving the game." He asked if we had hot water and asked me to heat it if there was none. He had the water heater turned off because the electricity bill was too high. We had to turn it on for an hour before taking a shower so that the water would warm up. If it stayed on the minimum, it would not cost much. We always do that. I told him a million times. Then I turned on the water heater. The football field is close to us, so ten minutes later he came home, went into the bathroom without resting. I understood from his face that they lost the match. I set the table while he was in the shower. He came out of the shower, put on his pajamas, and we sat down for dinner. His cheeks were red, as he had washed with very hot water. So, everything was normal. Gosh. When my father had a heart attack, his face was white when he came home. His face was white, his arm was numb. It was obvious that something was going to happen. No. Veli was so normal. I went to the kitchen, I put the tea on the stove. Put the dishes in the dishwasher. I was busy in the kitchen for 20 minutes. When I returned to the room, Veli had fallen from the chair and was lying face down on the floor. - Fallen? - Yes. Didn't you hear the man falling? I did not, Ahu. I did not. There was a lot of noise in the kitchen and the radio was on. I didn't hear. I went straight up to him and turned him. I did whatever came to my mind. I was panicking. Then I got up and went to our neighbor, Mr. Muhittin. The municipal police officer? No, the real estate agent. The police officer is Mr. Cafer. You should have called an ambulance. Is Muhittin a doctor? No one came to my mind at that moment. I walked out the door barefoot. Mr. Muhittin and Hacer were not at home. Then it came to my mind and I called the ambulance. You know the rest. We went to the hospital. Does a person die in a second? Oh, my Veli. Oh! Mom, my brother's days are over. Why should my son's life be over? Your life is over. He was young. It sounds like you are talking about a stranger. If he was your son, he was my husband. I did everything to keep him alive. Yeah, he was your husband. If you had let go of my son, my boy would have lived happily. If he had time. Don't act like you don't know. You got your hooks into my son. Mom, this is not the right place to talk. Mother. Oh, my son, your mother would die for you. You've been left alone in this world, son. The imam is at another funeral. There is a little time. You haven't eaten anything since last night. We will go have a meal and come back. Oh, I will not eat. Did my son die hungry or was he fed? What happens if I am fed? Bilal, can the dead man be left like that? What if he smells? Ahu, for God's sake, you're the only smart one, right? There is a cooling system inside. Do not make me explain. He was fed. Who? Veli. He ate his favorite stuffed vine leaves before he died. Haven't you cooked stuffed vine leaves? Oh, stuffed vegetables and stuffed vine leaves are all the same, Ahu. What are you talking about? The man is dead. God rest his soul. God rest his soul. God rest his soul. God rest his soul. Come on, Mom. Eat something so you will not feel weak. What can we do now? Is he going to come back while we sit here? My son, you're constantly saying that he will come back. You've got stuck. Do not say that. It is a sin. God forbid. I meant that may God forgive Bilal. I mean... I said that I hope that God forgives Bilal. I wish Veli would come back. You go eat. I will not. I will stay by my son. Mom, come on. It will get crowded later. Do not get weak. We are going to a place close by. Come on, Mom. Nermin will stay here. Nermin, we will bring you something to eat when we come back. Thank you. I will find something here. Come on, Mom. What should I do, son? I will come. Do not get angry with me around those girls. I am not getting angry, Mom. Let us go. Zeynep was going to come too. We have to let her know. What if she comes and can't see us here? Yeah, okay. We will call her now. Who called Zeynep? I forgot to call her in all this turmoil. I called her in the morning. She was speechless, she couldn't speak. What can the girl do? It is not easy. Of course, what dreams she... Let's go, Bilal. Let's go. Let's go, leaving our blood and soul here by himself. Mother, what will happen if you accompany this hollow body? Wherever you are, your son will see and hear you, do not worry. You are a woman of faith. You know this better than me. I am here, Mom. I will be with him. Nothing much changes when you are with him, Nermin. Okay, Mom. Throw these away, Ahu. Are you sure you do not want anything? - No, thank you. - Okay. This is my father's profession. Excuse me? My father was also a bather, and his father too. In other words, this profession has been passed down from father to son. Of course, I am not just saying that it is a male profession. Women can do it, too. Like from mother to daughter, too. Stuff like this is being talked about lately. Men and women. Equality... Not to be misunderstood. That is why I said it. How nice. Well... In other words, people often wonder why I chose this profession. That is why I said that. I mean, my childhood and my youth was spent around this marble. It has been two or three years since I lost my father, may he rest in peace. Otherwise, why would you choose this job? Your husband passed away young, too. I mean, there is no young or old in death, but still, it's an expression. My mother passed away at a young age, too. There was my father and me. Now it's only me. Do you have children? No. Of course you are used to it. How many funerals come and go here every day? Who knows? No, you can't get used to it. Everyone has a different story. Death is difficult for the living. If a person has something to hide, death unveils it. But it is still nice to have someone crying over you. It gives me a sense of security while I am alive. Otherwise, I do not really care what happens to me after I die. I do not care how many people would cry, or what would happen after my death. Anyway, what would a bather talk about? Of course, death. I'm not going to bore you. The deceased will probably go to the family cemetery. It is difficult to find a place with a beautiful view these days. There are many people, but not that much land. Soon we will fall off the edge of the world, one by one. You know, some people still think the world is flat, I mean... My cousin sent the news to our family group. I read it there. Seriously, there are those family groups who know what's going on in the world. If you look at the messages, you'd think they were professors for seven generations. Because of the subjects discussed. His family has a place in the village. My mother-in-law bought it. Great. May God not test us with an untimely death. But it is good to know where you will be buried when you die. It probably is. My mother-in-law bought the place for three people. For her two sons and herself. So, brides and grandchildren? She said, "Brides go to their own family cemetery." As for grandchildren, she gave up hope. You know what the weirdest thing is? People always wish they had said this and that about their loved ones. I never thought about things like that. In fact, the only thing I can think of is "Who will pay the electricity bill now?" We actually had good days. But the memories that come to my mind are all bad ones. Of course. It is normal. One time, a young girl had a breakdown at her father's funeral. I thought it must've been from sadness, but then the girl went inside, and she started shouting at the man. She kept crying saying, "You didn't even pat me on the head once." "You didn't love me." "Not once have you said, 'I love you.'" "I tried to be the kid you wanted so that one day you would do all of that." "Now you've fucked me up." "Who will I hold accountable for my childhood?" She was shouting and crying all day. I mean, there is no such thing as everyone experiencing pain the same way. If you couldn't make amends with the deceased, too bad. God has given man the gift of forgetting. How else could you deal with losing a loved one? "Loved one"? A decade ago, I would have said "I love you" to Veli. What do I say now? Veli. I would just say "Veli." But let me tell you something. Oddly, I am happy that Veli won't disappoint me anymore. Anyway... Now we need to write something on the tombstone. For sure. What is the most interesting phrase you have ever heard? I had a short one for my father. What? "This is destiny." Why? Whatever happened to him, he said, "This is destiny" and kept going. My mother died. "This is destiny," he said. He was fired from his job, "This is destiny." His house was foreclosed, "This is destiny." He was betrayed, "This is destiny." In other words, he died saying, "This is destiny." Beautiful. "This is destiny." What would you have written on your deceased's tombstone? It is complicated. I mean... It would have been one thing years ago, but something else now. Of course, as the years pass, the things you would say get deeper. No, just the opposite. You get to know more and more as the years go by... and you realize that nothing is that deep. Actually, you see that the things that come out of the deep are not special. When you look... the man you stared at the sky with and dreamed with is gone... and the man who was mad at you for three days because you poured tea for yourself but not for him is there instead. The man who called you "my breath" is gone... and the man who wants to get rid of you because you can't have a child, who wants a new "breeder," is here. The man who left daisies at your door because you liked them... is gone, and the man who hit you when you answered the phone late is here. I mean... If it was years ago, I would have written, "The only one who understands me. My joy." Now? "This is destiny." Uncle, welcome. My condolences. My condolences. We were so sad to hear the news. Your aunts say hello. They couldn't be here. Hello to all my friends... - Who is he? - The bather. Let's take a seat. There is a situation in the energy dimension. Everything you thought of for the last three days. It will rule the last ten years of your life. It is time for all the karma to disappear... The plane just landed. I just got on the bus because the taxi would be expensive from the airport. Where is my sister? They went out for a little bit. They will be back soon. Oh, is that so? Where did they go? They went for something to eat. The phone's battery is dead. Always out of charge. Do you have nails? Let me. Where is Veli? Where could he be, Uncle? He is inside. Have a look if you want. No, no. Hold on, let me catch up with my sister. They will be here if you wait. I should be with them. My sister is probably very sad. - Please, have a seat. - I... Do you have any change? I haven't been able to exchange euros yet. I will need them on the way. That 50 liras would work. Okay, I am going, tschüss. Is he a relative? Veli's uncle that lives in Germany. I'm going out for dinner. Come with me if you are hungry. No, thanks, I can't leave Veli. The deceased won't stand up and walk away. You all want the man to walk away. Why should a dead man start walking? I am sorry, I just said it. I was thinking of you. No, thanks, I can think of myself. But it wouldn't be bad if you grabbed some toast from the cafe on the way back. Okay. Sure. Keep it. Shall I get a mixed toast? No, with cheese. And tea if there is some. Okay, I will get tea, too. We are not done with you yet. We are not done with you. Even when you leave this world, I won't let you make me feel guilty. No, I won't. I, with my sulky face at home, was responsible for your unhappiness. I, who can't take care of myself at home, was responsible for your love being over. I, the one who could not have a child, was responsible for you looking for someone else. But I was not guilty of your death, Mr. Veli. Your death is not my fault. It means your time is up. It can't be my fault. I mean... You could have died even if I'd brought your medicine on time. Right? How could we know that? You would have died if I had not been at home. I could have gone to the bathroom at that time. People have to use the bathroom, right? Or you might not have had a heart attack, but a flowerpot could've fallen on your head and killed you. Your death cannot be my fault. You are listening to me from up above, right? You are probably nodding with a know-it-all attitude. I hate that look of yours. The crooked smile that makes people doubt their own intelligence. You can laugh a lot now, Veli. Silly! Silly! You are gone. What will happen now? Now you can go to someone else. To your new life. What will I do now? Will you get away with what you did to me? I am left here alone with what you have turned me into. You took all my virtues from me one by one. I finished school with honors. You made me doubt my own mind by saying, "You wouldn't know." What will happen now? I am left here alone with the fears you have engraved in my head. I hate you. What will I do now, Veli? What can you do in this life? I've forgotten so much about being on my own. What do people do all by themselves? I don't know. You were a good lover. And you have always been a good son. You have also been a good brother. You have also become a good friend to others. But you know what you could not be? A good husband, a good partner. You could not be either of those. You hated it when I cried. You always said, "Don't hide behind tears." It is pretty cold in here. You must be cold. You don't like cold weather at all. Do you know what, Veli? I love cold weather. It keeps you awake. But just because you liked it hot, I liked it too. However, I hate the heat. I also hated going to your mom's for breakfast on Sundays. How would you know? You screwed up my life! You didn't screw it up alone. You screwed it up all together. What are you saying? I can't hear you. You are saying, "Did I force you?" Right? You are right... you did not force me. I was... totally in love with you. Then I was attached to you. My attachments aren't normal either. I saw someone share it on Instagram. These kind of attachment issues are caused by "childhood traumas". Oh, see, you're not guilty again. You finally made me lose my mind. You emptied me. Why couldn't you die while I was gone? Even in death you've managed to get me in trouble. Why couldn't you die quietly while I was gone? You said, "How could I make this woman feel uneasy while I'm gone," and you've succeeded! But rest assured, Veli, I will be so happy. Don't worry about that. I will remember what I like or dislike and find myself. Worry about that, Veli. I will be Nermin again. I swear I will. It is not so easy to say goodbye. Yes. Indeed. You're lucky if you're able to say what you wanted to say while he was alive. That peace is different. But if there is anything you couldn't say, I'm sorry for that. That's with you for life. But you know what? The greatest gift given to us is to forget and move on. Suddenly you see, there is nothing left to hold one accountable for. Though it doesn't matter after you die. Are you poor or rich? Are you good or bad? You should not think about that much. You are just a piece of meat. What is the point of trying to be good while living, if it doesn't matter if you are good or bad? If you are good for the table, they say don't be, anyway. What will happen if you are comfortable under the ground if you can't rest your head on the pillow while you are alive? Can I tell you something? Being bad is difficult. Think about it, you are in such a deadlock that you are in the dark. You are trying to attract people who will come with you into that pit. You are so unhappy that you want someone else to be unhappy, too. Personally, I don't want that loneliness. A man who has a problem with someone else has a problem with himself. I would feel sorry for that man. That human. I mean that being. The woman, too. Of course, there are good and bad women. We are all equal after all. Is the tea cold? It wouldn't have gone cold if they had given it to me in a glass. But they don't give tea away in glasses. No, it's good. I like it lukewarm. Veli loved it hot. God rest his soul. Definitely. Well, let me take a look inside to see if there is anything missing. I'm sorry, I forgot. Is that enough? - If you don't have it, that's okay. - I've got it, here. - You will need the money. - Take it, brother. Do not be afraid. I've got it. Do not be afraid. Think of him as asleep, not dead. Think of it that way, okay? Some people can't look at the deceased's face during the last farewell. Others look at that calm face and become happy. I should st... Where is your family? The imam hasn't arrived either. I have to start washing him. Well, yes, I wish they'd come so he can be washed and buried soon. By the way, I want to ask you something. Maybe you've experienced it on the job, or heard it somewhere. They say that someone can die and come back to life. Is it true? I've never experienced it. But I know people who have. A close friend works in the morgue. This is our environment. It is about humans, but about humans who don't breathe. In my line of work, you know gravediggers, morgue workers, marble makers. For example, if I worked in a casino, my close circle would be a security guard for a singer... Anyway, what was I saying? Mesut, my morgue worker friend, saw one open his eyes and come back to life. But he also loved to lie. His nickname was "Do not lie, Ziya." I don't know the truth. But you say it can happen? That's what he said. Don't get your hopes up because I said that. Accept it and say that it is God's grace. You cannot live with that kind of pain. You can't die with the deceased. I have no such intention anyway. Mine is just curiosity. Has the imam arrived? Are we starting? No, he hasn't, but we have to start. Okay, the room is refrigerated to some extent, but how long? Well, let's get started, then. We'll pray as much as we can now. Can we do that? Sloppy. My son can do it. He reads the most beautiful prayers to his brother. I sent them to Quran courses. To the best imams. I sent them both to colleges and... I will call the imam, because he would ask, "Why did you call me and then start before I got here?" What if you say we are in a hurry? What hurry? My son is already gone. Why are you rushing to bury him in black soil so fast? Well? If you have somewhere to go, don't wait for us, Ms. Nermin. Not because of that, Mom. It hurts when I see him lying on that cold marble. That's why I said it. Come on, brother. You go ask. If not, I will pray. My condolences, Nermin. Bilal. Where is Ahu? Uncle Kamil came. Didn't you see him? My mother thought we would have visitors. She sent her home to dust everywhere so we wouldn't be unprepared. My uncle said he was tired and was going to take a nap at home. They will be back with Ahu soon. God, no need. The girl's been destroyed since yesterday. So, will the visitors from the funeral home be looking for dust? Of course they will. We cannot let you people say, "This man has no loved ones." When we're finished, we need to get a hundred or so Turkish pizzas. So those who come can eat. There won't be that many people. What if they do come? Will the people go hungry? Don't worry, it won't come out of your pocket. You already complained to my uncle about two bites of food. What? Did I? He said, "Our snake-tongue talked again." "Snake-tongue"? Just a saying. Don't worry now. You've given me a lot of names, but this is the first time I've heard that one. Also, yes, let them be hungry. Are we going to be thinking about people's empty stomachs? It is what it is. I cannot discuss the method with you now. Nermin? Come. Come. Yes? You know, the land we bought together with Veli. I know as much as you say while drinking tea and coffee. He doesn't tell me about those things. Why would he? Although the money he spends is our common savings... Common savings? I didn't know that. Now, that land was going to go to him while you were getting divorced. The poor man's time was not enough, he just died. God rest his soul. God rest his soul, but why don't I know about this? That you are getting divorced? That he would buy the land. Thanks to your mother, she reminded me of our divorce every day. And what are we talking about right now, Bilal? Is this the time or place for that? We're just chatting. He told me... "I will not leave the land to anyone." He dreamt of building a cottage on it. He said that we would need it for children in the future. God, forgive. Good heavens! So? Now the part of the deed that belongs to my brother will go to you. I say sell me that deed for half of its value. Let us never go to court. I will give you cash. You will need it. After all, you're a widow now. As far as I know, you don't have any money saved. What are you saying, Bilal? Am I going to discuss the deed with you right now? So what? Let us get it done while we wait. If brother Veli got divorced before he died, he wouldn't have left you a single penny. He died, the house you lived in is yours now. Thank God. What would I have done if your brother hadn't died? God, forgive. God rest his soul. I am being fair. I am just saying I will give you half of Veli's share. I say help me and sell it for the price I say. It's not as if you earned and bought it, Nermin. That land was bought with my brother's salary. What are you going to do? Build a cottage next to us? What kind of... What kind of a family are you? Is this the thing to talk about here? It's like a bad joke. Didn't we sell my gold and prepare your dowry when you were getting married? Did I not work and look after Veli for years until he got a job? Are you saying these things in front of a dead man? Am I the one who started this conversation? Besides, our family gave you the gold. I didn't see anything that came from your family. We will give you whatever you spend for your dowry. What are you talking about, two pairs of pants and a sock? Oh, I am going crazy. Did I mean that? Am I talking about that? Isn't it Veli who forced me to quit when he got the job? He was the one who convinced me by saying, "You took care of our house, now I will take care of it." You were ready anyway. - We had dreams of having a child. - But it came to nothing. Master, welcome. Thank you. Sorry, Imam, we rushed you. Not at all. It is our job. My condolences. My condolences. We made you rush, sorry. But the deceased has waited too long. I mean, I do not think he cares too much about it, but you know. Imam, let me see my son's last journey and read his prayer with you. No, lady, read your prayer here. It's like you're reading it next to him. Imam, please, can't I see my son for the last time? You will see him, of course. I will let you in before I close the shroud. Okay then. Mom, let them do their job as soon as possible. Veli will start stinking. Shut up, what do you know? Mom, stop it. Nermin is right. Oh, my Zeynep. My son had a lot of time left to live. That is right, Mom. Did you make them? My talented Zeynep. I took it out of my dowry. What will I do with them now? Oh, my baby. You are still young. No one would miss a bride like you. It is how it is, even if my heart aches. You are pure, you are hardworking, you obey. The slave of your dreams. It took ten years for you to get me into that state. This time you found the one that is ready, Mom. But no luck. Divine justice. You look at me. Watch your language, you have no shame. Oh, no. It is a sin. You are being rude, sister Nermin. Oh, dear. You call me sister Nermin, and my husband, Veli, huh? Your ex-husband. If my son had not died, you would've been divorced next week. What happened? - What do you mean? - Why did you come out? God forgive! She will not be comfortable until she buries my child in black soil. The items on this list have to be bought from the hospital café. Urgently. - I can. - Give it. - Give it to me, Bilal. - If you do not mind. Not at all, I saw it on my way. The hospital is just 100 meters away. Everything is on the list. If you ask the man, he'll give it to you. Okay. What a good person you are, Zeynep. God bless you. God forgive. Praise be. Bilal, if you were not married, I would not miss that bride. Mother. Come on, sit down. The smell of white soap came from inside. They also pour rose water. Sweet. He loved the smell of white soap. Especially in bed linen. He used to get in bed like a little child when I put clean bed linen on. He used to inhale the scent. He used to say that he slept happy. I always washed him with white soap when he was a kid. That is why. That is what he said. He also said that his grandmother used to make you wash the sheets all over if the sheets didn't smell of white soap enough. She would. God rest her soul, she really made me suffer. But she loved her son so much. He was his mother's only baby. She could not spare a thing. Weren't you like that too, Mom? Weren't you also your mother's baby? Let it be. Boys are different. Besides, it felt like torture back then, but what my mother-in-law taught me then helped me a lot. My deceased husband didn't have much of a voice at home. He would never defend me against his mother. In his life, he was so afraid of hurting people. That is why I think he got cancer in his throat. What he could not say accumulated there. That is why I raised my sons strong. I wanted them to take whatever they can get from this life. If they did not get it, I said I would get it for them. Thankfully, I did. They had everything. My brother. My sister, enough crying. You'll wear yourself down. Oh, Kamil. He is gone. My only son is gone. Oh Kamil, my brother. I am dying inside. He is gone. I am dying inside. Go see your nephew and say goodbye for the last time. My sister, I am afraid of the dead, you know that. I can't go in now. I will throw soil on him at the cemetery and say goodbye. Why are you afraid of death, Kamil? He's not going to stand up. Do not say it like that as if you do not know me. Did you eat anything? - Thanks. I ate some toast. - Did you clean the house, Ahu? The neighbors will come to the house for condolences. It would be rude. I did, Mom, do not worry. You should have cooked something to eat. Do you know what kind of services there are? Now, when you notify the municipality, they set up a tent. They even bring tea. Great service. The halva doesn't have nuts, but it's still a great service. Uncle, isn't that for those in need? Do we need help like that? Do not talk like you know so much. Anyone can call. There are many expenses during times like these, girl. Since I arrived, she's talked down to me. Have I? She does, she talks a lot. She is a university graduate. You speak less than her with your experience living abroad. Forget about her. How was the trip, Kamil? You came all the way from Germany for your nephew. Oh, brother. Of course I came, sister. He is my blood, my dear. It is our duty to be with him on his last journey. Gülistan? The kids? My wife and children stayed there. My wife and three children. Do you know how much the plane tickets cost? I won't recover for a year. What can we do? It is okay. Kamil, do you remember Zeynep, our neighbor's daughter? Hello, Uncle Kamil. I remember, I remember. Sweet girl, Zeynep. My condolences. Here, brother Bilal. - I have change somewhere here... - No, no, there is no need. It is okay. Come on, get back inside. Thanks anyway. I'll be back in a minute. Brother. Brother. If you hold him by the shoulder, I can wash his back, brother. Come on. What happened? The water cut off. What do you mean the water cut off? God forgive, God forgive. Son, isn't there a water tank here? Of course. Thank God there is. It just breaks down sometimes. I told our municipality that a water tank with the latest technology would be worthy, but they wouldn't listen. Sometimes the water is so cold that even the deceased get goosebumps. Would you believe it? God forgive. Come on, son, I do not have time. Let us do what we are going to do. I have to check the water tank. Look. The painters are coming to the house. I have to catch them. My wife is alone at home. Besides, it is a sin to keep the deceased here. I will be right back, Imam. Hurry up. Occupied. There you go, sister Nermin. What are you up to? What does that mean? You came here, shedding false tears. The game is over, my sister, what is your game? People are grieving. We lost someone. What do you mean? There is a thing called a conscience. I would feel uncomfortable if I stayed at home in this situation. You have that much of a conscience? Why doesn't your conscience work when it comes to me, Mrs. Zeynep? Shall we do the reckoning in front of the toilet door, while your husband's body is being washed? Don't you have any self-respect? Then again, if you had any... you wouldn't have stayed at that house while Veli was trying to divorce you. Would you? Zeynep. I hope you don't fall in love to the point you lose your self-respect. Because real love is not like something you can imagine. - Master. - Huh? I guess we will continue from where we left off, Imam. What do you mean? I thought that we wouldn't have to start over. Yes, yes. Do not worry. Are we going to start over? Will your prayer be in vain because we stopped, my son? That is what I thought, too. Don't worry. This municipality has invested a lot in this Ghusl room. The tiles and everything are all new. Looks in good shape, doesn't it? Sure, sure. I was going to have our bathroom done with these tiles. They asked for a lot of money, so I gave up. Looks great. It does. Do you need help? What happened? The water pipe valve got stuck. I was going to tighten it, but the door is stuck. Let me look. When you say goodbye to someone, you actually make room in your life. You see who you are, what you can do without him. That is when you learn what is really important. Who you were to begin with. There you go. I had a headache because I hadn't had a cigarette. I could not find the opportunity to sit and breathe. We've been dealing with the deceased since last night. I went and cleaned the house. Brought the uncle here. I have not even put a bite in my mouth yet. I would give anything for a cigarette and a cup of tea right now. You do not know how to handle them. Why do you beat yourself up so much? How can I not beat myself up, Zeynep? They are all over me. They've ruined me. You are going to say this, okay? You're going home to clean, but you will stretch out and lie down. You will pour a cup of tea. The dead one is gone. Are the visitors going to look for dust? Oh, as if it were so easy. You got off easily. If you had got married, you would've ended up like me too. Maybe even like Nermin. They emptied her like a purse for years, and years later, they decided to put her out of the door with nothing. No offense, but I am sad for the woman. Today for her, tomorrow for me. Women should support each other. A woman should not stab another woman in the back, Zeynep. True, Ahu. You are right. I will write your words on the wall of my room. You tell that to Satı. Isn't she a woman? They can't do to me what they did to her. I would take care of that Satı witch. As if I was so into that withered Veli. Don't talk like you don't know I'm running away from my stepdad. Shut up, girl, they will hear. Let them hear. I came because they may say that I was not with them during the bad times and they may want the gold they gave me in the engagement back. See? What a genius you are. I would not have thought about that. It is obvious, sister Ahu. If you'd thought of it, you would be at home laying down pretending that you were cleaning. Wait, I will solve your cigarette and tea issue. Mom. I will go to the bathroom with sister Ahu, by your leave. Go, girl. Ahu, don't leave my Zeynep alone. Do not worry, Mom. Sister, I will go to the bathroom too. I need to go. Go, but come quickly. Do not leave me alone here. Where is the bathroom here? How do I know? Maybe she knows. Mrs. Nermin, where is the bathroom here? It's in the back. Oh, my rose. Can I ever forget you... Wait, listen. There was a family issue, and I'm dealing with it. No, no, it's not an important issue, don't worry. What is wrong with my rose? Well, girl, I just sent money. You said that you were going to come and see me with it. No, it's not because I'm withholding money from you, it's because of the excitement of seeing you in real life. Exactly. I got it, I got it, but... Okay, I will find you some money. I will take a little bit of money from my sister. I came to Turkey just for you. But I want you with me tonight. Now, say a few dirty things to me, if you can... Kamil, what happened to you? Are you okay? I am fine, I am fine. Hello? Yes, Gülistan? Oh, wait. My battery died. I am at the Ghusl room with my sister now. Let me give it to her. Gülistan. Hello. Oh, my Gülistan. Thank you. Thank you so much. How are the children, Gülistan? Well? Oh, I would die for them. Hello? Oh, wait, let me. Your aunt. Hello, Aunt. Thanks, Aunt Gülistan. You too. Thanks. - She hang up? - No. Hello. Okay, I am giving it to her. Hello, Auntie. Thanks. Okay, okay. Thank you, he is not with me. Okay, thanks. Hello. Aunt Gülistan, how are you? Oh, thanks. Thanks. My condolences to you, too. Thanks. Hello. Okay, there is no one left. When Bilal gets out, I will have you talk... Okay, tschüss. Oh, come on! Does washing a dead body take this long? What do you mean, Kamil? Okay, this one is in a rush. Veli is dead, the partnership is over. Why are you in rush? I mean it is a sin to make the deceased wait this long. It is almost evening. It can be. What's wrong? Are you busy in the evening? No, sister. I mean there are friends who want to give their condolences. That's why I said it. They are more than welcome, son. Our door is always open to them. Thanks, sister, we will see. Do not worry, do not think about it now. He is alive! Bismillah! Bismillah! Oh, God! What happened? What happened? Is it the water tank again? Oh, God. No, he went that way for the water tank last time. - It must be something else. - Can you go in and check it? No, sister, I can't. Oh, good God! You are the mightiest, my Lord! Brother, are you okay? You are in shock, aren't you? Keep calm, all right? Keep calm! When he comes here, we will... We will find out now. What is happening? Probably not for one of us. Kamil, something happened. Mom, calm down. - Mom, calm down, please. - Not someone from our family, I suppose. Let's just wait. We'll see. My lovely mom, don't worry. It's all right. Okay. Bilal? Something happened to someone. Mom! Oh, praise be! Oh, good God! You are the mighty one! You are almighty! Oh, good God! - Imam. - Huh? I've never seen anything like that. Me neither! I could not move my body out of fear. See, it is God's will. It is obvious. It means he had more time. We are lucky to see it. God, you are great. No one would believe it if you told this story somewhere. How are you related to him, girl? My husband. See? You are God's beloved servant. It is the mighty God's will. It is difficult to live as a widow. He saved you from ending up a widow. Yeah, right. It is difficult. You can say anything that you kept inside the first time around. He suddenly... He suddenly started breathing. Like that. Divine justice. I've heard about these miracles, but this is the first time I've witnessed one. Go, run to your husband. I cannot feel my legs because I'm overjoyed, Hodja. Get her something. Would you like some water or something? No. A widow! If I died, would you tell Veli that being a widower is difficult? Of course, that has its difficulties, too. What kind of difficulties does that have? Women and men are always equal. They always are. It is difficult to not have someone protecting you, being there for you. What will he protect me from? There are various calamities on the streets. How about the calamities at home, Hodja? Now, isn't this weird? The Creator of the monsters and the ones that saves you from the monsters is the same. The same! Oh, for the love of God. If I died, they would be like, "She was a nice, quiet woman." Oh, how nice. I would be peacefully resting, right? But do you know what I decided on? I do not want them to think of me as a good person. Moreover, I do not want them to love me. A woman who has a voice is spiteful, right? When I die, I want them to say, "She was spiteful. A shrew, she was." "She always thought about herself. She was selfish." But I want my voice to echo in their ears. Oh, God, forgive. Say something. Hodja, I'll go check on them. Would you like anything? Water, maybe? No. Get water for her. Exactly. "God, forgive." God, forgive, yeah. For example, let us say Veli died again. What would happen if I cursed him all day for ruining my life? What would that change? Huh? What? Let me tell you, Imam, he would go to Heaven, too. He may have a couple of good deeds and houris all around him. He gets away with what he did to me. He did what he did when he was dying. He made me sin. He will snitch on me either here or there. Saying that it happened because of me. What's that supposed to mean, girl? Wasn't it a heart attack? It is difficult, Hodja. Sadness and happiness all got mixed up. Let's not push her more. Now they will find out everything. Find out what? God's justice! God's justice! God, you know the best. God, no one interferes with you. Dear God! No one interferes with your work, dear God! No one interferes, dear God! It means, "We came from God, and we all return to Him eventually." Thus, don't ever rebel against what happened. He had a breath to take. He completed it and then he died. Now, sit and pray for him. Don't you ever rebel. Do not. You are right, Hodja. Of course, I am. About what? He has justice. Do you believe in life after death? So, off I go. I am in a hurry. I need to catch the prayer time. My condolences. - Thank you. - Thank you. Come on. Come on. Come on, Uncle, Mom. Get in the car. Wait. Mom, please. Come on, Mom. Mom, can't you squeeze a little in the back? How about if I moved a little... Son, do I have the energy to move? Do not touch me. Okay, Bilal, no problem. I will catch you. - Okay, then. - Come on, Bilal. Let's go. Do you have money for the cab? If not... I do, I do.
