Do-Kang Kin's on a train. - Is that accurate? We have a witness. He was hiding in a temple and got out this morning. Mr. Sakoya is following him. [General's Son III] Is he on the train? I heard it from a reliable source. - Look for him, again! - Yes, sir. [Wonsan City] Excuse me. Where's the Wonsan tally office? Go that way. Is Mr. Sirai here? What? What do you want? I'm Doo-Han Kim from Jong-Lo. Well, bother what made you come? I didn't expect that you'd visit Wonsan. We heard that you beat the Hayashi gang, MP and even a Jap detective. Everyone, say hello. They're my men. Nice to meet you. Mr. Cho, president of Wonsan Cargo. Director of Korean Athletic Organization, Wonsan chapter. When I was younger he saved me from beaten up by Jong-Lo gangs. Where's EunSil? What happened to her? Please wait a bit longer. She's coming. Well, everyone... Toast! Brother, here. Here... Why do you want to go to ManChu? Why don't you stay here till you can go back? I'll help and support you In any way. Thanks. An actress, EunSil Jang from Nak musical troupe. She's sinning here for now. She's got secret reasons. Well, Ms.Jang. Come here and serve him. Come over here. I'll just sing. Why did I leave my home, my love and come to this strange land? Do I have to blame that to myself? Stop! Stop singing! Sing something we all know. Tears of Mokpo! The best room in this inn. - Have a good night. - Thanks for everything. Boss sent her here so that you can enjoy. Hey, get inside! It's Youn-Ok. I know. - Lights off? - Whatever. Hey, Eun-Sil! Open the door! Open the door! I said open it! Open! What's the matter with you? If you don't open, I'll break in. Don't look! He's not very nice. You think I can't break in? Open, you bitch! That's Eun-Sil's room. She sang tonight. Open, now! What are you looking at? You, listen! I swear I'll come back! - Are you just gonna sleep? - Yeah... I won't. - Is he awake? - Yes, sir. Bring that to a chef and tell her to cook for breakfast. What's this? It's cow's backbone for his stamina. Did you sleep well? Boss Sirai go to the Bong House tonight up in North. Huge gambling night. - He's there to gamble? - Nope. To collect money from gamblers. Every rich guy will be there. His blade and skills can threaten anyone and get him anything he wants. Everyone here can't sleep because of you. It's almost everyday! Don't smile. You should apologize to everyone here. I heard you jumped off from a train and fell from a high building without getting hurt? And when you kick high up in the air three to four people fall down at once. How can I be like that? That's all made up. You need to use your brain when fighting. And you need to read other's mind to win. Well, I'm sorry. I hope our breakfast tasted okay to you. It was delicious. Thank you. - Please have some dessert. - Thank you. She was a lead actress in a band. She came here a month ago with a band. But they left her here because they couldn't sell any tickets. They said they'd bring her back when they have enough money to pay off debt. But they never cam back. That's why she sings there. What happened last night? She despises Mr. Sirai. Every guy in town wants her but they can't do anything because of Mr. Sirai like her. Though there are guys who are willing to pay off her debt at once. Do you want to have her by paying off her debt? If you want her he won't say anything... I'm Doo-Han Kim. Could you show me around? You can't do this. What if she runs away? Mr. Sirai will be furious. Now, I can breathe. They never let me out. Where's your band now? They're probably in Chung-Jin up north. I really had a bad luck here. It was rainy all season. So, no one came. Do you not blame them who left you here? They'll be back once they make enough money. It's been a while that I had meat. They never feed me well for I'm in debt. Would you like some more? You know Il-Soon Park? He's a famous composer. He really liked my singing voice. He said I was very talented. If I get trained well I'll become a really great singer. He told me to come see him when I have a chance to visit Seoul. But... - It's all over. - What do you mean? Actually the band broke up. They couldn't sell tickets anywhere else, so... There's no hope left. I'd have to stay here doing nothing. You should find a way to get out. How about Mr. Sirai? Sirai... He said he'd pay it off if I sleep with him. Shouldn't there be attraction between a woman and a man if they wanna spend a night? He thinks he can buy that. What a trash! He's so retarded. I can't give anything to him. Either my heart or my body... There're many things that you can't buy, right, Mr. Kim? I told you I'd pay off her debt! Why did you let her out? I couldn't do anything! Please... That's a bull shit! You asshole! I told you to behave! - I'm sorry. - Fucker! Hey, why don't you calm down? You making me a bad person. You can stay out. This is my business. Don't use your fist that easily. Leave them alone. Don't try to teach me when you're on the run. And behave when you're not in your town. [Bongchum Manchu] - Are you Korean? - Yes, I am. Where's Dae Sung inn? I heard the owner's Korean. Can you see the sign? I want a room. - You, alone? - Give me the cheapest one. You can share a room. It's cheaper. Here. This is it. Well, I'll stay alone. Hey Suck, clean up room 12. Yes, sir. Excuse me. Do you know Double Blade? I heard that I could find him here. He's out of town today. He'll be back tomorrow. Why do you look for him? I wasn't sure but it was you. - You know me? - You don't recognize me? I'm Mall Face. Right. You, at the Dook island... You beat the shit out of me so I left and came here. I heard that you're on the run. One dose meet his enemy on a log bridge for sure. Boss, do you want me to beat him up? Leave it. We have plenty of time. Mr. Choi, tell him who I am. Sir, it's ready. Be careful! He is Double Blade's right-hand man. A very notorious gang here, has 5 Chinese men under him. For how long are you staying? - Two months. - Two months? - No, maybe a year. - A year? It's a dollar for a day. Give me 10 dollars in advance. - Don't have money. - Excuse me? When Double Blade comes back, he'll pay for it. Sir, I understand your situation, but then why don't you share a room? Come, move to the other room. Sir? Get out. Hey,you! You can take only one dumpling at a time. How much did you earn today? None. I should learn Chinese to make money. - Well, did you ask? - It's already full. There's a big construction going on south of city. You guys wanna go? It's too cold for construction work. Who's that coughing all nigh? I can't sleep. Please let me sleep! So, you just came back? You should have stayed all night and caught him. Go back tomorrow. Don't just come back tomorrow, understand? Everyone, drink! I said drink! Hey, you! Wake up! Why? - Can you write? - No, why? I have to write a letter to someone. You know anyone? - You can't write either? - Just answer the question. - Yeah, I know. - Who's that? Mi-Ryung, the daughter of the owner. She can write Korean, Japanese and Chinese. - That's great. - Bring her here. - No. - This piece of... Tell me. Whom are you writing to? My dear brothers, Moskito, Hammer, Hammerhead, Little Jong-Lo, Skinhead, Dog meat and everyone else... They are actual names? No, They might not be alive at this point. Send it to the Jo yang. Yes, sir. You, stay here! Don't bother me. It's me, Doo-Han I'm now in Bong-Chun. How's Jong-Lo and everyone else doing? I really wanna know. Little Jong-Lo, Dong meat Shot shot... Washington, Jang, Hammerhead, Big wart, Yong, Moskito... What's the matter? It's his letter. Who told you to do this? What's wrong with him? She's my girl! Leave her alone. Are you cussing? Don't!

So, you treat him well, too. And let it go. Yes, boss. Good. Good. - Having fun lately? - Yes, thanks to you. Who's he? He's the boss of mountain bandits here. It'd be hard for you to go back for now. I've almost died several times coming here. I thought Manchu would be better but no really... It's rather better here. Jane treat us better than Chinese. Although that's their tactic to break us apart. I heard he's your right-hand man. You should be happy. Not really. Actually, I'm a bit frustrated. I'm getting older. I can't fight like before. If they want to beat me, I won't be able to do anything. What are you talking about? Doo-Han, stay with me. This is my second home. I've settled in and like this place a lot. Forget Jong-Lo and start over here with me. - I'll think about it. - Yeah, think about it. Cheers! Three stamps to Basing and two to Shanghai. Hey, where to? Please go to right.

I'll be back! Thought you joined an army for independence... An independence movement? It wasn't for everyone. Especially a man like me Who's used to good life. I went to my home town became one of the merchants, made money crossing the boarder back and forth. I brought opium this time to make big money. I got caught by the police. Double Blade came.

Not the gangs or homeless... If they're exempted, they'll be more powerful than ever. I have a plan. Can you help? What kind of help do you need? Postpone the announcement for a while. But make a gossip that they'll be taken away. I'll use this and cut the growth of the Jong-Lo gang. - Hello. - How are you? Look at your body! Well, hi? First time? He's from Wonsan.

Heard that they're sending the gangs in town for work. Heard that, too. Hayashi wants to form a group together with you. He already talked to the Government. You can just work for... You want me to work for Japs? It's better than getting killed there. - No, I can't - Doo-Han, think! - Stop it. - Everyone else gets killed, too! You bastard! A Japs dog... - What! - Don't ever come here! You are killing your men because of your stupid pride. What a boss! Get the fuck out! Dial number 369. Il-Gwang Inn?

He's a good guy. - I'm not a bad person, either. - I hope you're not. - What did they say? - They said she's out. I've thought about it for a long time. My parents approved, too. Marry me. I don't want to marry, yet. Because of Kin? No. It's because I still have a lot to do. Marry me. Otherwise, I'll kill you and kill myself, too. Boss, did you hear? Ms. Jang's marring Gondo. What?

Are you marrying Gondo? - You heard? - Are you marrying him? Who can say no when he's threatening you with a sword? I brought it. You like threatening? Do you wanna marry me, or die here? - I'm going to Japan. - What? I have a deal with a record company there. It's a great opportunity for me. I won't live my life as someone's wife. You're mine. You can't leave! I've discussed it with Mr. Park. And, I've decided. What a bastard! No. You can't go! You're mine! I won't let you go. I know you love me. No. You can never leave! You're mine! He probably forgot. Let's just drink! Shigummon already joined with Honmazi. Yeongdeungpo and Mapo, too. We're alone. I heard we have a snitch here in our gang. Who's that? Huh? Who knows? He might be here right now. What's he thinking? Following a bitch around... It's a mess! A mess! Hey, where are the bitches? Bring more bottles! Do you think I have no woman to date? Bitch... My life. My way flowed with wind and clouds. I've lived the fullest although twisted and fallen. What an empty street that I turn away... - Hey, let's have one more. - Hey, let's go. Get out, get out! What the hell... I said get out! Kin, knees down. You're over. Don't look back. I'll cut your throat. Don't let him go. Doo-Han, run! I've survived, but my brothers... Do you still think I'm a Jap's dog? Let's not say that. I'm going to kill Hayashi. Show me the way. You're familiar with their building? I can't go! I can't kill my former boss. I'm not asking you to kill him. Just show me the way. You can't do anything, now. It'll be all guarded. - Look out! - Yes! Doo-Han Kim. Boss, I'm so sorry. Please understand. I would have come if I were you, too. Go! I'll send in a doctor. [End]
