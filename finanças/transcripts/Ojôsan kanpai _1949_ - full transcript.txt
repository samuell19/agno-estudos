I'll get you a taxi. The flat reminded me of something. - What did you say? - Oh, nothing. So a flat tire made you think of me? It was a flat tire that led to cars and then to you. It's my fault for not thinking of you. Take a look at this photo. It's no use. I'm not interested in marriage. Don't be a fool. You're 32 already. You have to have a wife. I'm actually 34. If you're aware of your age, get a wife already. Am I being scolded? You're a respectable man with a good business. You shouldn't be single. It's only a photo. Take a look. She's still a student. She's 26 years old. She is? This picture is from her school days. She's the daughter of my mentor. She's from a good family with a good education. - You should have no complaints. - I do. We're an unequal match. Don't say that. You're a good match. You're quite a respectable man. Don't tease me like that. Nice to see you. - How's it driving? - Not too good. Hurry up and fix it. I've got a buyer. Brother, don't sell this one. I'm attached to it. Don't be stupid. It's our business to sell cars. Come on, just meet her once. No, thanks. How's your car? My car's fine, but he's not. What is it? I'll bring you more business. Just do this for me. Those are two different things. Brother, what's this about? It's a stupid matter. It's not a stupid matter! It's not natural to be single at your age. You're persistent. Can't you leave me alone? When I believe in something, I don't give up. But it won't lead to anything. Isn't that rude to her family? You just have to marry her. It's that simple. Hey, you! You can't change his mind once he's set on something. That goes for me, too. Ishizu, you're such a blockhead. You're calling me a blockhead? I want my mother to choose my wife. Don't be old-fashioned. You have to find your own wife. You're a grown man, you know. - Of course, he is. - You stay out of this. You never know until you try. I know you'll like her. She went to Gakushuin School. Totally different status. You sure are old-fashioned. Status isn't a big deal anymore. That's none of your business. If I don't fix you, you'll be an old-fashioned boy forever. - Geezer! - Young fool! Watch me. I'll say no anyway. Try saying no to such a pretty lady. This is irritating. - Where do you want to meet? - Sparrow. Sparrow? That's a bar. I know. I eat lunch there everyday. It's convenient for me. It's not a matter of convenience. You can't meet at a bar. Then just tell them no. Don't threaten me. Okay, then. Noon tomorrow. Got it? Got it. - You finally folded. - After a long and hard struggle. - Make sure to be there at noon. - Enough already. I better go before you change your mind. You're 34 after all. This is depressing. No need to feel depressed. It'll be fun to just meet her. That's easy for you to say. I'm off. Hey, where are you off to? That girl again? You just worry about yourself. The woman you marry must come from a decent family. If you don't intend to marry her, don't go out with her. You don't have to tell me that. Hey. Hi. It's curry rice today. I have bigger issues than curry rice. Who got killed? There's a woman coming at noon today. Welcome. She's the daughter of some respectable family. Sounds like a detective novel. Sato's forcing me to meet her. He says I just have to meet her. Oh, is she going to be our wife? Don't be stupid. I'm just meeting her. I'm impressed with Sato. He's smart to choose you. Stop it. You're healthy and good at making money. If I were 10 years younger, I'd probably approach you. Are you going to meet her looking like that? What's the point in wearing format attire? Your rubber boots are a bit much. And no tie? I can't hide the fact that I'm in the car business. I guess you're going to show your true self. I'm curious about this young lady. I was just kidding. I have to go to the association meeting. Saki, make sure to treat the guests well. Yes, ma'am. And please enjoy yourself. Hot! Hot! They'll be here soon. - Are you ready? - You mean with tea and sweets? - You should drink some water. - You're right. I should. Hey, I'll have beer instead. Please come in. Mr. Ishizu, she's quite a lady. Where is Ishizu? Welcome. I won't do it. Hey, calm down. What's me matter? Come on. Miss Ikeda, this is Ishizu. - Hello, I’m Ikeda - I'm Ishizu. Please sit down. - You, too. - Yes. Too bad it's raining today. - Cigarette? - Yes. There you go. - Maybe you prefer beer? - No, I'm good. - I can bring the one you're drinking. - Stupid! How old are you now? I'm 34. I see. You're 34. That's a prime age. Don't you think so, Yasuko? Ishizu may look tough, but he's actually timid. Well. I'm not tough either. - Mr. Sato is another matter. - I've always been timid. - You're a horrible person. - Hey, watch it. Don't talk to me. Talk to each other. Thank you for coming to this place today. Not at all. I apologize. Mr. Sato, may I have a word? I'll have to say no to her. Don't be timid like that. Here you go. Are you learning to play the guitar? What? What's wrong with you? Why are you so down? Yeah, I’m down. I have no energy left. What? Why? I wish you could've had a look. At what? That lady. You would've had a heart attack and fainted. Wow, was she that pretty? Pretty? That's not it. I can't find the word for it. I'm at a loss for words. I've never seen a woman like that. She's like a goddess from heaven. I felt like I'd been struck by lightning. I couldn't breathe. You're being dramatic. I don't want to live anymore. Why do you feel that way? Marry her then. Stop joking. I'm no match for her no matter what I do. We live in different worlds. Heaven will punish me if I marry her.

It's raining today, but did you have to wear your rubber boots? I'm sorry. I know too well that you're a straightforward guy. You made me nervous. You didn't help me either. You only showed me her student picture. I was shocked when I saw her. I was sweating. Does that mean you like her? Don't tease me I know she'll say no. You never know. - You could be surprised - It won't work. You should leave the answer up to her. And you need to give your answer. I know what their answer is going to be. I'm asking for your answer. Hey, Goro, what shall I do? Well, I'd marry her. But I already have a girl. Okay then! I'm nervous. Yes, this is Yashima Auto. Mr. Sato from Tozai Company? Mr. Ishizu is off today. He may be at his apartment. Hello? Are you looking for Mr. Ishizu? I think he's here.

What's taking you so long? I know you want to call me stupid. Hey, Goro, don't you think it's a little strange? It could be some kind of mistake. It's not a mistake. You're a handsome man. But she's quite a lady. She can find someone better than me. I guess there's nobody else. You're a pretty good catch. - I guess I'll accept it then. - Don't be arrogant. You knew that from the beginning. "She's a goddess from Heaven. I felt like I was struck by lightning." Are you all right? Did that hurt? Of course it didn't hurt. I'm ready to drink tonight. Cheers. After you get married, will you approve of my marriage? I told you that girl isn't for you. - Shoot. - Cheers! That must be him. It's Sunday today, so everyone's here. Welcome. Take a seat here. Welcome to our house. Hello. Can you hold me? - Me, too. - There you go. They grew up in China so they're friendly. - How old are you? - How about you? - I am Yasuko's mother. - She's my Grandma. I'm Ishizu. Please have a seat. Grandma. I'm Yasuko's older sister. She's my Mom. I'm Ishizu. Pleased to meet you. Please have a seat. Come with your Mom. Hello. This is my husband, Ohashi. - I'm Ishizu. - I'm Ohashi. Please have a seat. They've returned from China. He was teaching at a university there. This isn't very good, but please try. Mr. Sato brought us those. That explains it. Mr. Sato, please have some. I teach Japanese at a middle school for a low salary. Dear. Let's go. We went back to my hometown. But I couldn't find work in Shikoku. - I'm from Shikoku, too. - Where in Shikoku? - I'm from Kochi. - I'm from Uwajima. That's nice. These are her grandparents. I am Ishizu. - Thank you for coming. - Welcome. Please have a seat. I hope you'll be able to stay for a while today. Thank you. This arrangement brought us together. It's a pleasure to make our acquaintance. My wife has been eager to meet you. I see. I hear you have an automotive shop. Yes. It must be profitable. That's rude to say. It's quite profitable. We're extremely busy. We used to have a car. What was it called? That was a Cadillac. That was when you were with us. We've changed the car since then. Grandfather, that was long ago. That was a beautiful car. It was also quiet. Grandmother let's go to the other room now that you've met him. Not yet. But you'll catch cold again. We should leave now. Please stay and relax. Yasuko, why don't you play the piano for him? Yes? Let's leave them. Dear? Why don't you play chess with Mr. Sato today? Well, okay. That's a good idea. You two enjoy yourselves. Try to make up for the other day. I'll see you later. Yasuko. - Please try some. - Thank you. - Your family is very nice. - Yes. What an impressive house. No, it's just the appearance. Would you play the piano? Has Mr. Sato told you about our situation? No, what is the situation? So he hasn't told you. My grandmother told me to play the piano for you. But we no longer have a piano. We've sold everything we could. Grandmother still thinks we have the piano. I thought for sure Mr. Sato had told you. Also... my father is currently in prison. I see. Excuse me? Please ask Mr. Sato for all the details. Welcome. - Where's the boss? - She's at the movies. She has an easy life. Let's go in the back. Right after the war, Yasuko's father was tricked into starting a bogus company. It turned out to be a fraud. Her father took the responsibility and got arrested. It was very unfortunate. That's why she couldn't find a husband. I'll be straight with you. Their mansion was put up as collateral for a loan. The loan is for a million yen. And that loan is due in three months. Then the marriage with me is for the money. To be honest, that's the reason. - I knew there was a catch. - You're right. I should tell you everything. - There's more? She was engaged. But that man died in the spring of last year. Don't rush into anything. I can't believe what you did. She's not meant to be my wife. I knew it was going too smoothly. But Ishizu, I can honestly swear this to you. Yasuko is an honest and kind lady. She's not one to take money over love. I want you to know that. Mr. Sato, if she really wants to marry me, and not just for the money, I'm willing to help financially. Thank you. Seeing her today, I like her even more. Then how about this idea? Go out with her for three months. I don't know why I cried. I don't know what came over me. But I couldn't stop crying. FINAL MATCH FOR NEW CHAMPION Do you like boxing? Yes that's going to be a great match. It'll be fun to watch. I've never been to a boxing match. - Shall we go see it? - You want to? Yes. You surprise me. Let's go then. Stupid! - Kanechika! Hang in there! - Stay strong! That's good Come on. One more. Kanechika! Isn't this fun? Yes, but we should get going. You don't look well. To Nishikata-machi. Please get in. Your birthday is in two days. Yes. I'll come see you. I'll pay you now. - There. - This isn't enough. Good night. - This is serious. - It's unfortunate. It's only his first broken heart. He'll be fine. - Hey. - Hello. - It's my treat tonight. - How nice. - Hey, you drunk. Have another. - Watch me. I'll bite you. Kei, what's gotten into you? I can't explain it. I'm just very happy today. Give me a beer. Stupid, hurry up. Goro. Hey. What's that look on your face? You look like you're at a wake. My girl says she's going to Osaka to make money. She wants to break up. You still don't get it. I told you a long time ago. That's the kind of girl she is. You don't know anything about her. You fool. Forget about her. Why are you crying like this? Act like a man. Everyone, drink up tonight. Something's funny with him today. I just can't sit still. Hey, come join us.

Is she home by now? - Didn't you take her home? - No. You're supposed to take your girlfriend home. Is that right? My fault. You don't know anything about relationships. Oh, well. Hey, listen. It's her birthday in two days. Listen. Make sure to get her a gift. - What shall I get her? - You better think hard about it. I don't know. What would be good for her? I know. "I work and work. But my life doesn't get easier. - I'm hungry. - Dear. I just stare at my hand." That was embarrassing. No, you were quite good. Mr. Ishizu is here. Yasuko. Nice to see you. - Hello. - Welcome. These are beautiful. Happy Birthday. Thank you very much. - Why don't you join us? - Thank you. I brought something for her I'll be right back. Hey, bring it in. Auntie, it's a huge piano. What? Don't hit it. Hey, be careful. You must take off your shoes. Use the leg. Not your leg, the leg of the piano. Be careful. Watch it right there. Watch that corner. Where would you like it? I guess over there. Over here? Put it over here. This way. Excuse us. Over here. Good. Be gentle with it. That's good. That's good. - Thank you, all. - Thank you. A gift from me. I hope you'll accept it. Yes, thank you very much. What's the matter? I don't feel well. Let's take you to your room. Are you all right? I'll play the piano. Miss Machida, would you dance the ballet? You were the one in the ballet performance. Don't you get dizzy from turning? Let me play it. Is that Beethoven? No, it's Chopin's Fantaisie-lmpromptu. I see. Chopin's Fantaisie-lmprom - I hope you're not troubled over this. He didn't mean it in a bad way. Of course. We shouldn't take his kindness in a bad way. But it makes me feel miserable. We don't deserve this. I know. I don't mean to feel sorry for ourselves. Will Yasuko be all right with a man like that? How about you play something? - How about you? - No, not me. How about what we played for our graduation? - That one - Okay? - Why don't you have a seat over there? - Okay.

Are you sure you can love him? If it's just for me, I can withstand any hardships. I can work if I want to. I can live without money. I don't have any obligation to my family. I don't long for my past. But, I can't expect my grandparents or my mother to feel the same way as I do. I know you're saving me. That's not it. I'm good at making money. I've hated living in poverty since I was little. I thought about money all the time. And I was able to attain my dream. If I keep working hard, money will keep flowing in. I'll make lots of money. My dream is to make cars. Make lots of money and build a great factory. Only money talks in this world. You can't do anything without money. So feel happy. I'll make lots of money for you. Before I build a factory, let's build our house. Doesn't that sound great? Where shall we go next? Let's head back. Okay, if you want. How about the theater? I'll go home today. Okay then. Do you not feel well? That's not it. - How about something to eat? - No, I'm fine. How about some tea? I know a place with good sweets. I'll go home. Okay. I'll get out here. I'll take you wherever you need to go. No, this is fine. Thank you very much. Nice to see you. - What happened? - I just wanted to see you. Can you wait a moment? I'm hungry. Welcome back. Brother, I need to talk to you. Goro. Are you going to go against me? Have you forgotten what I told you? I saved you from being homeless. You know I care for you. I want to make you a good man. Stupid! I guess he hates me. I'm prepared if he won't accept my wish. Is it because I'm a dancer? I think it's better for me to go to Osaka. Don't be pessimistic like that. I'm sad, too. Silly. You're pretty. You're good-looking, too. Stupid. I've had enough of your silliness. Don't be like that, Kimi. Welcome. Are you stopping by after your date again? You finished early today. I guess you didn't go anywhere special. Give me some liquor. Something strong. Is anything wrong? You look so serious. Give me a glass. Welcome. I hope you're not busy. No. - Please. - Thank you. - Please. - Thank you. Can I help you with something? No, nothing special. - Please. - Thank you. It's sake. Thank you. This is a strong shochu. Is it too strong? No, it's quite good. Really good. Yasuko. I came here because I'd like to talk to you about something. Unlike you, I don't have knowledge of music. And I don't know the proper etiquette. I may be dressed in a suit, but I'm a country bumpkin. My only merits are that I'm personable and a good businessman. Yasuko could you really want to marry a man like me? That's my intention. Why do you ask such a question? I don't know why. Let's sit down. How shall I say this? You're not approachable for me. I love you. But I don't believe you'll ever love me. I love you. I think you're a wonderful person. That's what I can't stand. I know you think I'm soft-hearted. That's what you think in your head. But I don't exist in your heart. But don't you think you're asking the impossible? We've only known each other for a short while. If you feel any dissatisfaction about how I behave towards you, it's only because we haven't gotten' to know each other yet. But I fell in love with you right away like I was struck by lightning. Mr. Ishizu. I'm sorry for my lack of effort. Effort? Do you have to work at it to love me? It must be the shochu. Let's get married. Everything will be fine if we get married. No. I don't want to marry if you don't love me. You'll only be miserable. Why would I be miserable? I'll be marrying a wealthy and kind man like yourself. So why miserable? Please stop. Are you making a fool of me? Please don't yell. You also said just the other day that money talks in this world. This is helpless. I was wondering who was here. I'm here alone today. So, how did it go? You bought this record. I have to be able to appreciate this music. Whiskey? Or brandy? Just coffee. You're depressed today. ♪ In Tosa of Kochi on top of Harimaya Bridge ♪ ♪ A priest was buying a hair ornament ♪ Brother. I want to marry her. Give me permission. I want you to be okay with it. We're in love. We want to marry. - This is something I must do. - Don't do it. - Why not? - I doesn't matter why. Why do you object? Just don't do it I'll marry anyway. - Kei! - You idiot! Brother! Brother! I stopped by and you weren't home. I came to tell you everything. I want to be honest with you. I think you know that I had a fiancé in the past. Yes, I know. I loved Haruki. His name was Haruki Ogata. He passed away, didn't he? It was shortly after he returned from Manchuria. He was such a nice person. I heard he was intelligent. Top of his class at the Imperial University. I hope this doesn't upset you. I will tell you everything. Please go ahead. Don't mind me. I want you to do whatever you want after you hear my story. I used up all my love and affection on that man. The fire inside my heart is gone now. What remains is only some smoke of sadness. That's who I am. But I appreciated your kindness from the bottom of my heart. I truly want to marry you. That's not a lie. That's how I truly felt. Somehow money became part of the condition of the marriage. My feelings towards you may not appear pure to you. That's because of my family's financial struggle. But my family's situation is beyond my control. So it's not something I planned on. But if this situation is going to give you a hard time or give any dissatisfaction to you, I'll understand if you decline the arrangement. Yasuko, that's not it. I just want you to love me. I can't stand it that sometimes you feel very distant. Even if I feel like holding you, you show no emotions. You don't get excited. You just put on a faint smile. That's painful for me. I want you desperately. Mr. Ishizu. Please know Haruki and I never even kissed. Then are you willing to meet my friends and family as my fiancé? Let's take you home. Hello, is this Yashima? It's me. Get a car over to me. To my apartment. - Good night. - Good night. I'm back. What's the matter? You say what's the matter? My gloves. I see. I wish you happiness. If we get married, he'll take care of our loan. and everything else. So there's no need for you to worry anymore. I want to make sure this marriage is going to bring you happiness. There isn't anyone more wonderful than him. I love him more and more every day. - Hello. - Looks like you're ready. - You're early. - I was nearby, so I just stopped by. There's still time before 3:00. Where's the groom? He went to get the bride. The day is finally here. It will be a load off my shoulders. I'm also very relieved. How many guests do we have? You, me and Goro. A total of five. A small party, but let's have a big celebration. - How about a pre-celebration drink? - Funny. Yasuko is late. She should be back any minute. That's fine. I'm the one who came early. She grew up spoiled. She doesn't know much about the world out there. - Please give her guidance. - Yes. But she's fluent in English and French. She's an unfortunate girl. But she has a bright future ahead. Is that right? Mr. Ishizu, do you play any sports? Yes, I'm into boxing. You box? No, I like to watch boxing. But I was good at sumo when I was a soldier. Yasuko is good at skiing and tennis. Then we'll go play together. Don't you think she's unhappy these says? No, that's not true. Once she started seeing Mr. Ishizu, she has become quite cheerful. But I think she's lost weight. That's because she had a hard life up until now. She only plays sad music. Is she that unhappy? No. The music she plays is a serenade. That's right. A serenade of sorrow. Haruki used to like that music. That's right. Haruki liked it. Those were the days. Let's not complain anymore. Today is a celebration. I can't stop my tears. Excuse me. Ouch! Are you all right? - Yes. I'm doomed. Welcome back. - Did you fix it? - Yes, I finally did. - You can have this car. - What? Go get you bride in this car. In this car? Your tenacity won. Marry her. - Are you sure? - You better go before I change my mind. What about your bride? Don't worry Just go get her. Be happy! I'm taking 10 days off. So take care of things for me. Enjoy. I realized the different worlds we live in. I wish you happiness. I've made an arrangement with the creditor regarding your family's loan. So it's not your concern anymore. I enjoyed our short time together. Farewell to the young lady. I don't know why I cried. I don't know what came over me. But I couldn't stop crying. A gift from me. I hope you'll accept it. Yasuko, I promise I'll make you happy. Before I build a factory, let's build our house. Doesn't that sound great? Well? - Where's the young lady? - I won't do it. - What do you mean? - Our marriage. Stop joking around. I closed the bar for your celebration. It's true. Look at this. I'm going home for 10 days. I need some motherly love. What exactly happened? - Don't worry - Of course I worry. Look at my face. Don't I look refreshed? - I'm happily declining. - But... Don't say any more. I'm fine. I doubt you're fine. I feel relieved now. This is all good. I don't feel relieved. What about all the work I've done? Give me a drink. Forget it. How annoying. Are they coming soon? Do you want some brandy? I have tons of beer, too. Thanks. I'll have some beer. Lady, let's have a toast. Here's to the young lady. What an annoying young lady. Don't say that. By the way, Goro is getting married. So celebrate his marriage instead. Can you talk to Mr. Sato?

You dumped him so he went back home. He lifted this glass and toasted, "Here's to the young lady." Lady. He bought this record because he was in love with you. He cried as he listened to this before he left. Let me ask you what you don't like about that wonderful man. I don't know the proper etiquette like you people. But what makes a man is his spirit. If you don't understand his spirit, how can you call yourself a woman? Give me a drink. Just give me another drink. - But... - It's fine. I'm going to drink until I get sick. I love that man. Then, why didn't you hold him tight? You can't show love by acting aloof. I love him. Such an irritating young lady. You're just saying you love him. That's not showing love. Tell me you're truly in love. Where's Brother? He went back home. What? What time does his train leave? It's the express train at 3:00. There's still time.
