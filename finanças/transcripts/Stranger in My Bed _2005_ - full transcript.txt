My wife told me when her father passed away she received nothing from his estate. That's not true She got two hundred thousands from his will. Then I found this She disappeared in the cave system about a year ago she was officially declared dead all though her body was never recovered. Convenient So she set the whole thing up That's her personal information birthday social security number etcetera Last question why do you want to find your wi? She's my wife I love her to death I'll see what I can do Hello I have something you'll be interested in Mr. Hansen If you like I can drop by your house this eg Great look we'll see ya at eight o'clock Just over two years ago your wife opened a bank account With initial deposit over two hundred thousands dollars I manage to get a copy of the graph The account was cleaned out just a few days before your wife's disappearance The funds were wired to a bank account under the name of Julie Nickles Julie Nickles is that whats she calling her self now. So where is she? Turlin West Virginia But the trails end with the wire. Unless I actually go there myself I cant tell you whether Julie is your. So I guess you'll be going to Turlin Well in that case I'll need some advance money for my expenses As I said earlier money is not.
