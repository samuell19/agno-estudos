What's up? Nothing. Okay. Thank you. It's only fair. Nah, not really. You actually get paid for your job. Can we see some of your stuff? It's not ready quite yet. - Yet? - This one's a huge art fan. - Oh. - Are you really? No, she's teasing. She thinks it's funny. Oh my gosh, did you guys get that puppy? Aww, Charlie. Oh my gosh, it's so cute. You guys got the dog then? No, we decided not to. Yup. We. The big royal we, right? Yeah, we did talk about that. Wasn't he the cutest dog you ever saw though? Oh my gosh, he was so cute. Did you show him? Did she show you? - She showed me the dog. It's a good-lookin' animal. You know I work long hours, so it wouldn't be fair to the dog. Okay. Let's not lie to our friends. Mr. Super Cop over here doesn't think I'm wifey material. - No, no, no no, no. - No. If we got a dog, then he'd have to commit. That's our cue. So thank you for dinner. - This was so fun. - This was so fun. This was great. Next time our place, 'kay? Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. - Please soon. Yeah, we'll show you out. - Great. - Thank you, guys. We'll show ya out. - No, you started it. - I started it? No, you started it. You started it with that- - No. - Come on. All I did was ask. Why do you bother watching? You can't leave me with them. I can't stay either. All right? Nothing. You know, I don't think there's anything that we could possibly do to straighten this out. Shut the fuck up! You're gonna wake him up. Where do you think you're going? To see my boyfriend. Your boyfriend? I think you mean your drug dealer. I told you, mom, that stuff wasn't his. That stuff wasn't his? Really? Will that be his defense at his trial, huh? Okay, maybe he's not the only person on earth who smokes crack. What are you tryin' to tell me, Susie? - Nothing. - You know what? Just don't start with me right now. Now is not a good time, okay? It's never a good time, is it? Go to your room. I told you I was going. I told you what I was doing. What more do you want from me, okay? Jesus Christ. Mom! Don't speak to me like this, okay? Just shut up! Fuck. You just hit me! It is my job, Susie, to protect you and to keep you away from criminals and drug dealers. He's not a criminal! I told you he's not a criminal! - Mom. - Go to your room. - No! - Please. Mom, please stop. Your father knows I'm right. Your father, he knows I'm right. Dad? Dad, can I stay in here with you? I got work to do Close the door. Hey babe. Hey. I can't talk about it right now. Something happened at work and I need you to come get me. - Okay. - Thank you. Yeah, I'll be right there. So you didn't lose control or anything? How you feelin' today, George? Anxiety? Maybe somethin' you said and then he picked up on that? What's making you so angry. You. You're the one who said that he reminded you of your dad. No, I didn't do anything at all. Then why? I heard you laugh at me. This last time I was here. I was outside. You were on the phone with somebody. I heard the whole thing. This is similar to what we talked about about last week. He's got PPD. Distrust is a classic symptom of that disorder. Challenging to treat. George. I heard you laugh at me! You bitch! Fuckin' bitch. What did the cops say? - That I broke his nose. - Jesus. Lucky shot, I guess. What happens now? The state board is going to investigate me. They have to. And I will be suspended until the investigation is over. Suspended. Okay. What are we gonna do? Can you call Robert? I already did. He said they're not hiring and he doesn't know anyone else who is. So what about your show? It's not for another couple months. Couldn't you move it up? Gallery's booked out in advance and I'm just not ready. So how much do you have left in savings? Just enough to make this conversation more depressing. Well I can carry us for a few months, but- I know. We have to do something. We will. Since when do you drink white? It's all we had. We're gonna have to rent out the spare room. Not necessarily. I was actually thinking- I already put an ad online. I'm sorry. Me too. You gotta do it like this. Spot me. Spot me. Pretty cool, huh? Yeah. I'm leaving tonight. When? Whenever dad gets home. He's late, so mom's gonna be busy arguing with him. Did you hear me? Yeah. Where are you going? Trevor, he has some family in Nevada. We're gonna go and stay with them. Are you ever coming back? Would you? Look, I'm always gonna be your sister, okay? Nothing is ever gonna change that. C'mon. I'll always be here with you, 'kay? - Hi. - Julie? Yeah. Here to talk to you about the room. Perfect. Yeah. Come on in. - How are you? - Good. How are you? - Good. Very good. - Nice to meet you. Oh, check this out. It's gonna be right down here. Alrighty. I do Yoga, Tai Chi and life. Oh, that's so nice. So this is the room. Check it out. Give it a spin. You get your own bathroom, nice bed, closet. Yeah. 900 bucks a month, little steep for- Well it's a great neighborhood. Yeah. So you have full access to the kitchen and we've got the washer and dryer in there. - Oh, cool. - Yeah. Make yourself at home. Kitchen sounds good. I really like that, yeah. - You can cook. That's great. - Yeah, no. We love someone who can cook. - I know. - Either way. - Sounds great. - We need to try that out. So this is the room. It's a nice-size room. You have your own private bath. Obviously you have the bed. Decent-sized storage area in the closet. - Yeah. - Great. So what's your snake policy? - What? - Do we have a snake policy? And what would it be if there was a snake? I think- Do you keep it in a box? Did you guys get this bedbug certified? We have not. - Mm-mmm, nope. - Yet. But we can do that. Absolutely. Well when you do, wouldn't it be like a certificate? Okay. It's the first time movin' outta my mom's house so excited and lookin' for a good place. - You're movin' out. - Yeah. - First place. - Finally. First place. Hi. You're here about the room, right? Yes, I hope it's still available. I'm looking to get settled in right away. You know, I'm so sorry. It just got rented. - Sad face. - I know. Bye. Who was that? Jehovah's witness. Those are the worst. Hi. Hey, I'm Paul. We had an appointment. - Hey, Ben. - Ben. Nice to meet you, Paul. - Nice to meet you. - Come on in. Thank you. Should we show you the room? Please. It's right this way. So Julie and I sleep right across the hallway. Here's the room. It's got a great bathroom, your own shower. Nice size closet, bed. It's actually a great room. This is big. I like this. Is it okay if I? Yeah, absolutely. So the ad said 900. Is that still the rate you guys were thinkin'? We could go down to 850. That'd be great. 850. What do you do for a living, Paul? Is it okay if I? Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Test this out? - Get in there. So nothing right now. I used to work in finance in New York. Mm-hmm. Be willing to pay up front. - 'Kay. - What're you doin' out here? I just want a change of pace. I've never seen California. Just kinda see what it was all about. It's great out here actually. It seems amazing. Hikes and you can go surfing. Right, right, right. So why did you quit your job? We got a lotta questions. No, no. I get it. Someone's movin' in your house. This is a big deal. I don't know. I guess I just wanted a change of pace. I wanted to see the sun every once in a while. How long were you planning on staying? That's a good question. At least a year. That's real quick. And if it's all the same to you, I can just give you that now. Get it outta the way. - You give us- - The full year. - The full year? - Yes. I'd rather just have it done, paid for, outta the way. And I can pay with cash. I'm cool with cash, but I think we'll let you know. Oh. Yeah, of course. Right. No, very good. - Yeah. No, after you. Thanks. Awesome. Is this real hardwood or is this laminate? - It's laminate, yeah. It's real laminate. It is a pleasure meetin' you both. Hey Paul, thanks for comin' by. - Absolutely. - Yeah, thank you. You both have a good night, okay? You see that? You see how that's loose right there? I could fix that right up for ya. You know, we have been meaning to get to that. And we will get to it today. Are you sure? Because my tools are right in the truck. - I got it. - Yeah? Yeah, I appreciate it though. Okay no, man. Absolutely. You both have a good night. Okay. You too, Paul. Well thank you. All right. Drive safe, Paul. Thanks again. Well? I finally found him online. He's got tons of friends on different social media, hundreds of pictures. I mean he seems like a pretty normal guy. One year? It's a long time. When we got the house, it felt- - Final. - Yes. Julie, this is our first house. It's supposed to be ours. Never thought I'd have a roommate again. Me neither. You're my roommate. - Really? - The food was good. The conversation wasn't but whatever. Yeah, well you know once we join this company, it is what it is, Max. Listen Bonnie, I'm just going- So when's he coming? He's not. I'm walking over to the gas station on Stevenson Avenue and he's picking me up. So why are you still here? Do you like the look of me right now? I don't really know. Like a bitch. You know. - Ooh. That's a big- What if they hear us? - Bitch? - I can tell 'em you went to go sleep over at Lisa's or something if you want. That won't really make a difference, okay? We'll be across the state line by morning. Can you at least tell me where you're going? - Stop drinking. - Listen, Max. No, you listen to me, Max. - You really need to. I don't think that's a good idea. At least not right away, okay? But I wanted to send you a birthday present. Listen, Max. It's not up to me. I'm a better man than this. You know mom and dad love us, right? So then why are you leaving? - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. You're keeping it. What's keeping you here? Because she just doesn't know how to show it. Dad too. - Why are you still here? - I'm here, Bonnie. I think they prefer if you left. But I love you, okay? So come here. Get up. I love you, okay? I love you so, so much. David, do you know where your sister is? Listen, Max. Get out here now! - What? What? - Can you get out here? Pretend to care where your daughter is please. Dammit! Did you two get into it again last night? No, but you would know if you ever poked your head outside that door. Dad. Dad. Can we shoot tomorrow? Why you wanna learn how to shoot guns? Max, did you call yet? Kinda wanted to get outta the house. All right. Let's go. Julie. Julie, guess. You got your old job back. No, no. And that actually kinda makes my news seem pretty shitty. What happened? One of Devin's bartenders got a part on a TV show. He offered me the job. Oh. It's just day shifts to start. But as long as I don't screw up, he's gonna put me on Friday and Saturday nights in a couple weeks. He said I can make like 200 bucks a shift on a Friday night, maybe more. Well that's great, baby. Still gonna have to rent out the room. Babe, I think that's him. Let's go say hello. Hey guys. All right, all right. Extend your arms. All right, but you don't wanna lock 'em out, okay? All right, relax your shoulders. 'Kay, all right. Bend your knees a little bit. There you go. There you go. Okay, you ready? All right, now line up your shot. All right, shoot. Tougher than it looks, right? Yeah. So you're goin' hunting with Uncle Bobby next weekend, right? Yes. Can I come? I don't know if I could sneak that one by your mom. Hey, she doesn't like guns. Why does she have to know? Maybe when you're a little older, all right, bud? Let's try this again, all right? Line up your shot. Line it up. There you go. Shoot. Yes. Close, close. Yes! So I was thinking tomorrow, maybe we could run to the store and pick up some stuff to invite Gary and Zamia over again. Should we have invited him to eat with us? We only had enough steak for two. I mean what would we have given him? I just don't want him to feel like we intentionally you know, excluded him. We'll invite him next time. - Yeah. - Your turn on the dishes. Yeah, I'll do 'em in the morning. Tonight. I'll do 'em right now. Fuck. - Hey man. - Hey. We're gonna go to bed. You cool? I'm great. Thank you. Welcome home. Or welcome to our home. - Welcome to our home. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. I really do. - Sure, sure. This is gonna be good. 'Kay. Have a good night, Paul. - You too. - Okay. - Goodnight. - Thank you. Goodnight, babe. Okay. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What if he hears us? Try not to moan so loud. - Second. - Oh no. Yeah. Yeah, yeah? Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Oh gosh. Yeah? - Oh yeah. - Yeah? - Oh yeah. Yeah? Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, right there. - Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah? C'mon. - Yes, yes, yes. - C'mon, c'mon. C'mon, baby. C'mon, c'mon. Shit. Did we wake him up? - Shh. - Shh. He's coming. Oh shit. What? I'll call you. Sweetheart? David. David, will you look at me please? Why are you up? Sweetheart? David, please look at me. David? Look at me. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he definitely heard us. It's our house. He'll live. - Good morning. - Good morning. Excuse me. Thanks for doin' the dishes. It's not a problem. Actually couldn't sleep last night. Can I offer you some coffee? I don't drink the stuff. Thank you though. So I guess you're back to work. No, actually habit, I guess. Can I make you dinner tonight? Just me? And Ben of course. - Sure. - Great. Enjoy the coffee. So no pants, that's a thing now. Sweet. There she is. Wow, Paul. I don't know if we should eat it or take a picture. Little wine for ya? - Yeah. - Yes, please. Absolutely. Excellent. - Thank you. - Indeed. So Paul, do you have any family out here or is everyone back East? Not out here. Are you from the East Coast originally? No. I'm sorry. I bounced around in the foster care system for a while, so I'm not really from anywhere and I never really had a family to speak of. - We're sorry to hear that. - How old were you when you lost them? It's okay. They died when I was a teenager. How 'bout a toast? Hmm, all right. To new friends. - New friends. - New friends. ♪ I had the chance ♪ You doin' all right, man? Cool. Cool, cool. You want another beer? - Yeah, sure. - Yeah? You got it. Make this one a cold one. Cold one. You got it, Jerry. There you go, Jer. Jerry, what's up, brother? How you doin' today, man? Hey, feelin' all right. Great. So you findin' everything all right today? Yeah, it's been goin' pretty smooth. Little bit on the slower side. But otherwise, it's been pretty cool. It's 2:30, you know? Cut it some slack. - It's the middle of the day. - Yeah? Yeah. Hey listen, Devin. I just wanted to say thank you for giving me the opportunity to have this job. It means a lot to Julie and I. - Stop. Stop, please. Stop, man. Stop. - No, really. - You would've done the same thing for me. Yeah, of course. And besides, man, you haven't broken anything or pissed anybody off yet as far as I can tell. Am I right about that, Jerry? Guy's a real asshole. Keeps askin' me if I need anything. Okay then. So we'll see you tonight. Tonight? Why not? I mean you're good enough for Jerry, you're good enough for me. Now you're a real asshole too. Now see? Yeah, Devin. Thank you. Thanks again. Don't worry about it, man. Keep up the good work. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Whiskey and ginger? Yeah, what do ya got? Excuse me. Hey man. Look, I ordered... Hey, excuse me. Just one second. One second. One sec. Excuse me? I'll be right with you, okay? Hey, hey, hey. You doin' good, man? - Yeah. - Hey, you doin' all right? - Yeah. You got this, G. Thank you. I'm fine. I'm fine, all right? Open or closed? - Open. - All right, hang on. It's two dirty vodka martinis, extra dirty. Three gummy bear shots. I don't know what that is. Yeah, I'm not sure either. Just. Excuse me. This is way too strong like straight-up vodka strong. I'll get you another one. Excuse me. This guy can't make your drink. - Excuse me. - Why do we keep coming here? This sucks. - Do you have any free beer? Opa. Vodka, sorry? Come on. Julie. Julie. Paul has nothin' to do with it. I know you want him to act like. I'm so insulted and you are blaming him. You broke a glass over someone's face. If it wasn't for me, Julie, I swear- You wanna make everything so perfect that you push our daughter out of the house. How perfect will it be when David decides he's had enough too? It's time to be a parent. And I'm not? You didn't even try to look for her. Because I know she doesn't wanna be found. - Hey Paul. - Hey, there he is. Bulb went out. I was at the store so I thought I'd pick one up for ya and fix it. Mind poppin' the light on there for me, bud? - Hey. - Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, man. Anytime, man. What are we watching, guys? Do you want some? Want one? Hey there, bud. I'm gettin' Chinese. You in? I'm good. - You sure? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah. - Thanks. - Okay. - Hey Jules. - Hey. Who got you flowers? Paul. He said he saw someone selling them on the street and he thought of me. He was gonna sneak them in and pretend they were from you. Oh. Okay. Hey, where you two goin'? Lunch. That's perfect. I was on my way out. Lemme treat you guys. - We- - We need some alone time. Yeah. That's understood. Okay. We'll see you later, man. 'Kay, have a good time. Okay, you guys have a good time. Jules, open the door. Is that Ben? No, he's still at work. - Z. - He's such an asshole. Who's that? That's Paul. I told you about him. Oh, right. Well you're probably awake now, right? I am. Good. I need a male perspective. Three years. You think you know somebody after three years. He knew what he was getting into, right? I mean you pretty much know the first couple months whether you wanna be with somebody or not, right? I know how I feel after the first night. Then why if you didn't like somebody's personality would you stay with them for three years? Are you sure it just wasn't another fight? I mean Gary loves you, Z. A weak man will stay with his woman long past losing interest. He wasn't weak. He was a cop. Doesn't matter. A coward's a coward. Doesn't matter what he does, doesn't matter how big he is. None of it matters. I loved him. Sweetie, you and Gary are gonna work this out. No. - What? - Excuse me? You cannot give love to someone who's incapable of giving it back. Underneath it all, you'll suspect it isn't real and you will hold back because of it. Paul, we appreciate you tryin' to help, but you don't even know Gary. No, maybe he's right. I mean it never felt right, you know? It never felt like it was supposed to. Vodka sour, right? Yeah. Okay, so where did you leave it with him? I threw a rock through his car window. You are definitely sleeping here tonight. It's not why I came over, Jules. No, it's fine. Ben isn't gonna be home 'til 2:30 anyway and we can sleep on the couch. There's no reason for two people to sleep on one couch when I can. You'll take my bed, okay? That's that. Hey, just gonna grab my charger real quick. Goodnight. Hang out. Hey. Hey. Is he still here? - Who? - Paul. He left like an hour ago. Why? Zamia came over last night. They had sex. What? You sure? Did you see something? No, I didn't have to see anything. What I heard wasn't open to interpretation. Shit. I mean don't you think that's a little weird? He met her like an hour before. He's a guy, babe. She'd been drinking. All right, so are you sayin' it was like- No, no. So she seemed into it. Yeah. Okay. Then they're adults and it is none of our business. No, I think he did it to mess with me. Why would he do that? Because of that night he heard us. Julie, what does he care? He knew I would hear. He was completely sober and he knew that I would have to listen. Okay, so should we give him his money back because he likes to have sex? Okay, you're not here all the time. You work nights, you sleep during the day. - Julie. - There is something not right about him. Julie, I love you. But we can't kick someone outta the house because they had consensual sex with our crazy friend. Goodnight or mornin' or what is it? Go back to bed. What's up? I wanted to see you one last time before you left again. Listen, bud. Your mom and I are just goin' through some stuff right now. But listen, if you ever wanna talk to me, we can talk. Are you gonna leave for good? Maybe. That shouldn't change anything between us, you're my son. It's just better for everybody like this. I gotta go to work, bud. But it's Sunday. Yeah, but I need the overtime. Hey Paul. Hey. These aren't bad, man. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - I like these. When's the show? Just a couple weeks away now. And these are definitely goin' up, right? Maybe, maybe. What're you talkin' about maybe? Honestly, I'm not sure. We'll see. You're not sure? Look at this thing. This is beautiful, Ben. What's goin' on? Talk to me. What's goin' on? We only get so many shots and I just don't know if this exhibit, these pieces are in game-shape or gallery- You know what? That's bullshit. It's bullshit and you know it. These are very good. Quit bein' such a pussy. No, I'm not. I don't necessarily think that's the situation here. Yeah. Ben, why'd you stop painting? Let's get to the crux of it. Why did you stop? Well when you moved in, that room was kind of my studio space. Are you an artist? Yes, I think so. Yeah? You think so? - Yes. - You made these. - Yes. You would call yourself an artist. Yes. Then create something, Ben. 'Kay, you need space? Take an easel, put it in the backyard. Quit makin' excuses. I gotta go to the store. Yeah. How's the job goin' there, bud? It's fine. I don't think I'll have much of a career as a bartender anyways. Anyways. Be careful please. Just be careful. I will. Have a good night, man. Here you go, darlin'. Hey bartender. I'm feeling good tonight. I wanna buy a round of shots for everyone sitting here. - All right. - Yeah. All right. Okay. Yeah, sure. What're we doin' a shot of? We're doin' a shot of dealer's choice, my friend. I'm pretty sure you know what you're doin' back there. Comin' up. You know that guy? - No. - Keep 'em happy. Nice work. Thanks. All right. Here you go, guys. Here you go. All right, for y'all. There you go, guys. And one for yourself too, bud. Sure. Sure. This looks good. Everybody, salut. Cheers. Yeah, yeah. Great choice on whatever the hell you put in that. Line doesn't stop here. I'll tell ya that right now. Your name's David, right? No, man. You must have me confused with someone else. Name's Paul. Hmm, couple years ago, desert sapphire in Arizona. We were playing cards. You remember that? I'm terrible at cards, man. All right. Yeah, you're right. My mistake. Yeah, like I said I think you're mistaken. Have yourself a good evening. Hey you too, bud. All right, who's game for another round? Yes? Yes? Yes, let's do it and something different this time. - Yeah? - Do it. Let's do it. Line it up. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Lemme try somethin'. I got it, okay. Yes. Look at this guy go, huh? Nice, like a waterfall. Here they are. There they go. Gimme your glasses. Everybody gets one. All right, here we go. Everyone. Missed the cigarettes.

That piece of shit, I show him a couple of pictures of my family, my ex-wife, my daughters. So he shows me a picture of his sister, young, beautiful. All I said is, "Hey, she's pretty."

I also have good news. 'Kay. I just got off the phone with Devin and I'm being promoted to head bartender. - That's great. - Yeah. - That means- - More money. And especially if you get your job back, we can get rid of Paul. And get our room back. Yeah, that's good. We can ask Paul to leave. Let's tell him today. Okay. - 30 days. - All right. Yeah, cheers. To 30 days. Hey Paul? Paul? Where is he? What's that, Ben? Hey Paul? Hey Paul? Paul, hey. Hey, I hope it's okay I use this. - Yeah, it's fine. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Well we're in a position where we no longer need to rent out the room. You got a promotion. Well Julie's probably getting her job back. Why'd you get that promotion, Ben? I appreciate everything. We appreciate everything. It's just- - Right. We're married. I mean wouldn't you be more comfortable in a place of your own? You obviously have enough money. I'll be out by tonight. No, you don't. Was I rude? The hell was that about? Hey Jules? Mr. Samson? Hey Jules. Where's my patient? Oh, he's walkin' down the street with a couple hundred bucks in his pocket happy as a clam. He does wanna schedule for next week, by the way. What did you tell him? Hmm, I just told him that your husband wanted to surprise you for our anniversary. How did you even get in here? Well it was real tough, Jules. I had to wait about five minutes to tag in behind someone through the door. And I like that door code 333. You put a lotta effort into that one and I appreciate it. What do you want, Paul? You know, I've been in a lotta these offices over the years. I could tell you anything I want, all the things I've done and you couldn't tell anyone. Unless you're an active threat now. Yes. Unless I was an active threat. Who are SR and DR? You are not my patient, Paul. Do I need to call the cops? Why would you need to do that, Jules? We're just two friends hangin' out, shootin' the shit as they say. I just wanted to stop by to see where you worked and say hello. And I love the space, by the way. It's very calming, very soothing. Have a good day. God bless. What is that? Shit. No. No, no. No. C'mon. Fuck, fuck. Fuck. You son of a bitch. Shit, shit! We should call the cops. Why? He didn't destroy anything valuable. You know, I don't have to go. It's been three days. We've changed the locks. At some point, you've gotta work. I'm not closing, so that's good. Okay. Would you keep texting me please, so I know you're okay? I will. 'Kay, I love you. Love you too. Okay, I'll see you in a little bit. You doin' all right, Jerry? Yeah. Good. There he is. Favorite bartender. What are you doing? Hey, our best customer. How you doin', sir? Doin' well. It's good to see you. - Good to see you. You know this guy right here, this guy really understands all the facets of customer service. He really gets it. He definitely does. You know what? First round's on us, okay? Ben'll take great care of you. - I appreciate that. - Appreciate you, my man. I'm just here to drink. What can I get for you, sir? Hmm. I trust ya. Get away from me or I'll break the next one over your face. Don't you think we should probably call Julie for that, Ben? Get outta here. Here you go, sir. On the house. Doin' all right? I'll do one more please. Just as a whiskey rocks. Open or closed? Just closed please. Thanks. Hey man, Paul Smith. Hi. Alan Brady. - Alan Brady. - Yeah, nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you, Alan Brady. Mm-hmm. You wrappin' things up? Yeah, I got an early morning. That's the worst time. I'm used to it. Thanks. Thanks. What do ya say, bottoms up? Yeah. You be easy now. Oh my. Call an ambulance! Sir, you okay? Sir. It's gonna be okay. Sir, sir. Ben, call an ambulance! Yeah, there's a guy. He's choking at the bar. There's blood. No. No, I get that. Okay. Bye. You know my favorite part about this job? The owner never gets involved. He lets me handle the day-to-day. We barely even speak. All that's done now. And the sickest part about this whole thing is we got lucky. I mean thank god that man survived. Can you imagine if he died on our floor? We may as well have blown this place up. - Devin, I- - I know. You broke a piece of glass and the next customer choked on that piece of glass, right or wrong? It was him, I told you. What, a random customer? Why would he do somethin' like that? He's not a random customer. He's my roommate, ex-roommate now. You lied to me? It was him. I need your keys. There's no video at the bar. There's no way to prove he did anything wrong. The number you gave me is to a burner. There's no registration needed for that and I guarantee you he's thrown it in the trash by now. You have no idea where he's from. You're tellin' me his name is Paul Smith. Do you know how many Paul Smiths we have in our system? Everyone knows the same story we do. He's from New York and he worked in finance. Just acquaintances. Look, if you had a copy of his driver's license or a credit card or anything like that, I could do some real digging. What he did at Julie's work and with my paintings. I mean those are technically crimes, right? Sure. Well trespassing, property damage. Even if you had him in hand right now, there's no way he's gonna do time for either one of those two things. You could try a restraining order. We're definitely doing that. Get the restraining order, get an alarm system. I know you don't wanna hear that, but it's the best you can do right now. Do you lock the door? Yes. User arming in progress. Can you sleep? No. Can you sleep? No. Listen, you gotta go to work tomorrow. I don't. Just try. I just can't. Fuck. Was that the alarm? Could it be a malfunction? We're not that lucky. We're all gonna go sit down at the table and have ourselves a nice little conversation! Hmm. Come on, Julie. Come on. Come here. Come on, get this back in there Faster, Julie. Faster please! Maybe this is as good as time as any. No it isn't, Max. Your mother and I are getting separated. It's what's best for everyone. We have planned to wait until the end of the school year to tell you. You're smart, bud. You see how we are. We're just not good together anymore. Good. Are we done? Do not look back here please, Julie. Thank you very much. Up against the wall. - Listen to him. Shut up. Quit bein' such a pussy. Can you shut up please? Huh? - Yes. Yes? Good, Ben. That's good. Come here. Good, bud. All right, sit down. What do you want, Paul? What do you want, huh? Do not move, Julie! - No. - Get back! Okay. Thank you. Calm down, Ben. Calm down, okay? Yeah? Yeah? - Yes. If I hear one more snivel outta you that has not been caught, this is what's gonna happen. This is my house. It's mine, all right? This is my house! All of it! Everything you see is mine. It's my house. I'm gonna give you cash, a wad of cash. You want a bunch of cash and you pretend like the house doesn't even exist and you'll never have to see me again, huh? Just don't hurt her. "Just don't hurt her," eh? "Just don't hurt her." Oh god! If you have that much money, why don't you go buy your own house? Get back in the corner, Julie please. I don't wanna hurt you. I know. Paul, can work this out. - We can work it out. - Yes. ♪ We can work it out ♪ ♪ We can work it out ♪ Ooh. Ooh. Get! We cannot. We cannot work it out. You want this house so bad? The second you pull that trigger, you will never have it. What did you think? Did you think we'd become friends and we would sell you the house? This is our home. We're not leaving. You can kill us if you want, but you still lose. Fucking! Oh, you're right. You're right. You are right. And when you're right, you're right. Julie. Ben. Ivy. Ivy Lane. Okay. I don't know if he's coming back. He's here. Please just get someone here right away. I got a boy on a stoop. Hey buddy. Got a call about some noise, you okay? David, are you in there? Open this door now or I'm comin' in. Can you hear me in there, David? David! Hey, you by yourself? What's goin' on, man? Talk to me. Anybody in the house? - Susie. - David. Hi. Hi. - Hi. You're the sister? - Susie. Nice to meet you. - How you doin'? Got him talk finally. Yeah. Let's go inside, bud okay? Some good rice. God you're back. Nothing good can stay here. Okay, we should burn it. Stop! Don't move. You know how use that, Julie? I guess we'll find out. Go ahead. Told you that I didn't wanna hurt ya. I just wanted the house. It's not yours to have. Then no one will have it. Ready to go, Jules, huh? Ready to go, huh, Jules? Huh? Sis? Sis? Fuck! Did you find out who he was? Well with that many aliases there was enough of a trail, we could track down his real name. He used to live with his family in this house. What? Yeah.
