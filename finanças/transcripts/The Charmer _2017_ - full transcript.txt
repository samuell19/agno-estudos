Are you thinking about him? I give up. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. Aren't you going to have a baby soon? - I think its a little too soon. - It's very beautiful here. - The surroundings are fantastic. - Thanks, Esmail. - We could live here, right? - Yes. - Are you looking for a place? - No, no. - It's lovely. - It's taken a long time to fix it up. It's worth the wait. It's lovely. Where are you branching out? In Kolding. ...convince them to move to Kolding. We'll see what you have to offer. Let's try. You'd like to introduce them? - It's beautiful. - Thanks. - Thanks for-- the guide. - The tour. What a nice day. This isn't working out, Esmail. It's just not working. You're rushing it. I love you. Yeah. Why do you laugh? No, I just can't do this. You're always here. You've more or less moved in without asking. You're suffocating me. I don't-- I don't really know you. You can stay the night. We're good together, aren't we? We're good at this. But that's not enough. - Hello? -Esmail? Can you hear me? How are you? We've missed the sound of your voice. I know. It's complicated. My computer broke down. Don't worry about it. Is there any progress? Not really. It's okay. We know you're trying your best. Did you get the money? Hello? I can't hear you. Hello? I miss you. - Esmail. - Hi. - Hi. Good to see you. - You too. Last time we met, you told me you'd moved in with your girlfriend. Could the both of you come in and write a letter stating that you're cohabiters? Can't I write it? - You alone? - Yes. No. Can she support you? When do you need the letter about-- Cohabitation? As soon as possible, if I'm to help you in time. Esmail... you'd better prepare yourself for the risk of being sent back to Iran. When? Well, it's hard to say. Maybe in a couple of months. We can offer you counseling on repatriation if you need it. But come back with your girlfriend, and we'll try. Thank you. Thank you for your time. - You've been what? - Stood up. Oh, no! No. I don't get it either. Cheers. I'm sorry, but my Danish isn't very good. - Oh, I think your Danish is fine. - Thanks. Yours too. Thanks. I can buy you a drink maybe? No, I'd better get going. I'd like to see you again. - It was nice meeting you. - You too. - Want to go inside? - I'd rather go to your place. My place? We can't go to my place. So now what? It has started to thin out. It must be easy for a guy like you to meet women. - You do understand Danish, don't you? - Yes. I'm more of a meat-and-potatoes kinda guy. They have that at home. They're looking for someone like you. Point taken. Good luck. Careful, careful! Now flip it. - Down with it, yes. - Oh, hi. Can we pop round? There you go. Mind the wall on your way down, okay? We're on our way up. They're just moving. Excuse me? Hey! Oh, thanks. - Don't they have a rear staircase? - Did we drop the shoe again? Thanks. Have a nice day. Good job today. - See you. - Take care now. Johnny, thanks a lot. - You bet. - I need the money. - Transfer to where? - To Iran. Come on. We have to go. - Will you order? - Yes. I don't know a thing about wine. - I don't even like wine. - Nobody here does. What are you drinking? This one? - I'm Liv. - Esmail. - Did you order? - No. But this is Esmail. Sara. - You're here a lot, aren't you? - Maybe. How come? I like wine. Are you Iranian? - You speak Farsi? - Some. I was born here. How long have you been here? For more than two years. Let me get you some wine. Maybe a glass of-- Are you here to meet women? - Isn't that why most men are here? - You know what I mean. What's going on? - We can pay for ourselves. - I've got it. What? - I'd like to pay. - You'd better not hit on my friend. Liv? Just a second. We're waiting for you. Well, we have to go now. Nice meeting you. - You too. - Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Sorry. I thought we were having drinks here first. - Flirting with strangers, are you? - Always. So you haven't given up yet either? Pretty empty tonight, huh? Hang on. It's great to see you again. Sorry. Hi, sweetie. - I thought it was Dad. - No, he's away. You know that. The nanny usually takes him if he wakes up, so- You're married? Aren't you in a relationship? Isn't that why we can't go to your place? Are you asleep? What the hell are you doing? Amir. Amir. Now you're Danish like me. Wed better go if we want to hear her sing. Yeah, we'd better. Hi. How are you? - Fine. And you? - I'm okay. Actually, we were just leaving. We're going to this big Persian party. - A Persian party? In Denmark? - Yes. - Do you want to tag along? - Yes, come. No. Maybe we can find you a wife? We just need to check she's a Danish citizen. - And that she's not your friend. - Okay, you've lost me. - I'm telling him to come. - Yeah. Come on. - Shall we? - Let's do it. - Khoresh gheimeh. - Oh, you know it? Or that one. But that's a bit spicy, right? Look what I got. Want to share it? Here? You'll forget all your worries. Liv loves these parties. - But you don't? - I'm here for my mom's sake. - Your mom's here'? - Don't worry. She doesn't notice anything. - How long before it kicks in? - Half an hour. I'll look after you. Okay. Dear friends. I am pleased to introduce one of our greatest singers. Please give a round of applause for Leila Kazemi. That's Sara's mom. Really? - Are you glad you came? - Very. - Can you tell? - There you are. - Well, what did you think? - It was great. - Hello. - Who's your friend? This is Esmail. This is my mom, Leila. - Your performance was wonderful. - That's very sweet of you. How do you know each other? I don't think I've seen you before. Esmail hasn't been to any of these parties, so I felt sorry for him. Why not? I haven't been here that long. - You have no family here? - No. Why don't you come for dinner one day, Esmail? I'll make you a nice home-cooked meal. Between us, the food here isn't great. I'd love to. Thank you. - Should I come? - Sure. Let's go out for a smoke. Sorry. Fuck, I feel amazing. Last time you were here, you promised to bring your girlfriend. I haven't heard from you since. I don't know what you're planning, Esmail, but I strongly advise you from absconding. If you do, I can't help you. I hope you understand. Please call me back. Not our lucky night, is it? Hey, I'm not gay. Well, neither am I. But that might be easier than this. I don't feel like going home. I haven't been alone for that long. - Need a ride? - No, I live far from here. Nobody's waiting for me. This is it. Thanks. I think you knew my wife. Her name was Anna. So it is you. Do you know she's dead? She jumped out the window. I had taken her back, but-- Then-- Do you understand what I'm telling you? She's dead. Yes. I thought you should know. - Good evening, Leila. - Good evening, Esmail. Nice to see you. You don't need to take off your shoes. - This way. - Thank you. Make yourself at home. Sara! I see you've met my dad. That's your dad? Be careful. He sees everything. If you don't do your homework. Or if you lie to my mom. Or so she says. - It's good to see you. - I'm glad you invited me. My mom invited you. I'm just kidding. But I'd rather see you somewhere else. Sara. Is it as good as back home? It's better. Sara made it. I helped out. She's busy studying half the night, but she still finds time to help me. She's a good cook. I only wish she'd practice her Persian. - Maybe you could help her? - Enough, Mom. Have you always wanted to practice law? “Vekalat”? You know, a lawyer. No, not really. It's a good choice. Sara will make a great lawyer. I'm sure she will. What about you, Esmail? Did you come here to study? I'm afraid not. Then what do you do? I work as a mover. Oh. It's only temporary, I hope. I'd like to study, if they let me stay in the country. Not knowing is hard. I hope it works out for you. What a shame. I really like him. He's very polite. And he's got intelligent eyes. I'm sure he'll do fine if he's allowed to stay. What's wrong with you tonight? You just sat there all evening being quiet. Mom, stop it. Get your feet off the table, Sara. - I have to study for tomorrow. - Okay. See you soon, okay? Thank you very much. Good night. - Is it worth drinking? - Yes. Thank you. I didn't know if you preferred red or white. I have white wine if you want. Cheers. Esmail. Does it mean anything? I don't know. - Am I even pronouncing it right? - You're saying it fine. I think it's a beautiful name. Take me from behind. Here you go. Thanks. Hello. Hello. Sara, is that you? Nothing. I'm on my way home. Are you drunk? Turn down the music. I can't hear you. Okay, I'll be right over. - Hi. Where did you come from? - From work. Oh. Come in. She's in here. She's had a bit too much to drink, that's all. Sara. Sara? Hi. You're here. - Are you feeling unwell? - I don't understand that language. I had a fight with my mom. And I've had too much to drink. Do you want water? I'm going on 26, and I have to sleep at home every night. Otherwise she has nightmares. Why don't I move out like a normal person? We drive each other crazy. - You saw it for yourself. - It wasn't that bad. No, because you were there. Are you okay? Have you got a big family in Iran? Yes. Do you miss them? Yes. But I'm here now. Yes, you are. - You really didn't have to take me home. - I Know. I'm not going to marry you just so you can stay in the country. Did you tell your mom that? I think she likes me. She likes everyone from Iran who likes to hear her sing. Can you sing? - Lucky I won't be a singer then. - Definitely. I've got it. Go on in. Come with me? I don't want to fight with her. There you are. What happened? Nothing. I didn't feel well and Esmail offered to take me home. - Thank you. - My pleasure. I just need to get some sleep. Can he stay in the guest room? I don't want to send him home this late. - No, it's okay. - Of course you can stay. Please come in. Come on. I can't sleep. You're not really here. I'm not? What were you hoping to find in Denmark? Me? No. I could never have imagined you. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Your mother's right next door. That's why we have to be very quiet. Can you be that quiet? It's usually not a good sign if I can. Okay, we'll stop. I can't come when I'm drunk, anyway. - Are you comfortable? - Yes. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Coffee? - Please. Sara, more bread? - Yes, please. Have you got enough bread? Have some juice. Thank you. We're going to have a small party and we could use your help. Of course. Did she ever see this place? You need to leave. She was always eyeing guys like you. Maybe she just had to fuck a raghead. You must have put on quite a show. She thought you loved her. You need to leave. What was it she found out? - She already knew you needed her to stay. - Leave. Did you even like fucking her? Or did you do it because you had to? Answer. Answer! Leave. Why haven't you called? We were afraid something had happened. Yes, I got your e-mail. Don't worry. I'm fine. - When why haven't you called? - Did you get the money I sent? Yes. You have to stay in touch. Otherwise we worry. I'm glad you got the money. I have to go now. There's no need to be concerned, okay? Esmail? Hello? Yes. I can't see you. Can you see me? No. The connection's bad. Let me talk to him in private, please. Esmail... I don't know if I can go on like this. Do you really think we have a future over there? I don't know I'm going to forget you. Why aren't you saying anything? It's a bad connection. I'll call you later. Will I ever see you again? This is good. - It's good. - You think you can tell by knocking? - Crazy Iranians. - You don't believe me? - We'll see. - Yes, we will. - Is that really Sara, all grown up? - Yes. Hello. And this is Esmail, Sara's friend. They make a handsome couple. Thank you very much. She's so nice. - She thought we were getting married. Yes. Are you okay? Yes. Just go ahead. I'll be right there. Sara, bring me the garland, please. Esmail. I've got something for you. This belonged to Sara's father. Nobody uses it now. I hope it fits. I'm so glad you came into our lives. Thank you. I want to see you! Come in. It suits you. You look beautiful. Sara! I can't stand it. Let's run away. The guests are here. Come on. - Is that Sara's boyfriend? - Yes, that's him. Excuse me? Please join us. Leave that to the women. - I don't want to intrude. - You won't. You haven't become completely Danish yet, have you? - Hello. Esmail. - Good evening. Sit down. Welcome to Denmark. You brought the sun with you. May I ask what you're doing here? How long have you been in Denmark? More than two years. How do you know Leila? Through her daughter. You've really become a part of this family fast. Leila is a very respected person here. Everybody knows her name. I hope you won't be a burden to her. What about your family back in Iran? Are you still in touch with them? Yes. But not so much lately. You must never forget Iran. Do you feel at home here? After 30 years here, we still don't feel as much at home here as you. - You're not Afghani, are you? - What kind of a question is that? You don't go in there unless you want to hear about the good old days in Iran. - Are you okay? - Yes. Is that you? Yes. Take off your ugly shoes. Do you realize how many people have asked me today if we're getting married? I think... if it weren't for my mom... I might marry you. That's what you need, isn't it? I can't marry you. I can't. What do you mean? Tell me. I'm in love with you. You're in love with me? But you shouldn't be? Says who? Tell me. This wasn't meant to happen. Not like this. Let's dance. You're not married to Sara yet. Leave me alone! Esmail, what are you doing? Sara. - Calm down. - Sara. It was an accident. I didn't mean for it to happen. Let me go. Let me go! You don't understand! Sara! Go on, do it! - Hello, Mr. Esmail. You're back. - Hello. Where have you been? Germany? Sweden? Did you meet Zlatan Ibrahimovic? Did you meet him? Hello. Let me see your face, my darling. Do you remember me? I'm your dad. I can't believe how much you've grown. I know I've been gone for a long time. When you're older, you'll understand. But Daddy won't leave you ever again. I promise. Go sit next to your dad, girls. Come here. - Eat, father. - Thank you. Let's have a smoke. Thank you. In the years you've been away, my daughter has kept this family together. Now you have to get to know the girls again and make a fresh start. The life you dreamt of is gone. You'll have to start over. Here. We'll see what God has in store for you. I don't want to repeat myself. - You don't need to. - You're like a son to me. Why haven't we heard from you? We didn't know anything at all. I know. You look so different. Now what? Are you still my husband? Yes. If you'll let me. - Welcome. Please come in. - Thank you. It fits you perfectly. It's stained. It'll wash out. We'll help you. How does it feel? Good? Stretch your legs. Lift up your arms. Can you dance in it? Yes. You should be able to dance.
