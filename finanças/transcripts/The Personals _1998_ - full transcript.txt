Look up. Some people stop producing enough tears when they pass thirty. Tears are produced for two reasons. Firstly, the eyes need moistening. Secondly, when you get emotional like crying or you're moved by something. Good. Is it serious? No. I'll Prescribe some eye drops. Take them and come back for another check next Monday afternoon, OK? I put a personal ad in the newspaper. I know it's hard to believe. Call It a momentary slip then. Besides, who knows? Maybe I'll find happiness. I've got over a hundred calls in three days. Some of them asked to see my picture. I said to them, I didn't ask to see theirs so they shouldn't ask to see mine either. It's fair. I don't tell Them I'm a doctor either. Anyway, I've already quit my job. What made you decide to put up a personal ad to look for a husband? I couldn't think of anything better. Then I thought... But you're not... you're not bad looking. You must be very popular. You didn't find anyone suitable? I don't want someone from my circle. And I feel that I can't be on my own for now. What did you say? I can't be on my own. You can't be on your own? You mentioned your circle... What do you do? I've just quit. I used to work in a hospital You worked in a hospital? Why did you quit? I wanted some changes in my life. Changes? Have you had boyfriends? Yes. How many? Four. Four... How long was the longest relationship? How long? Over three years. The shortest? Over a year. Over a year? Could I ask something more personal? It depends. Hello. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. My name's Wang. Wang Chao-ming. Yes, I know. My friends call me Wang Chao. Because Wang Chao means the "Royal Soldier". So they call me Wang Chao. Do you get it? Do you mind me chewing betel nut? I wouldn't say I would but... I'm sorry. I smoke as well. You have to keep chewing. You can't stop, can you? No, no. I can stop. If you don't like it, I can stop. I'll Just spit it out. Is it OK? It's OK. You keep chewing. In that case... So, Mr. Wang, you say that you work in a PC factory? Yes, it's an industrial Job. I cut PC boards. One after another. Each sheets is cut down the line. Mr. Wang, I wonder... how much do you make from your work? My pay? Around NT$30,000 per month. It's not a lot. But it's enough to survive. Enough to keep a roof over my head. Definitely enough! But is it enough to support a wife? Of course it is. I can work extra time. For my wife... I'd work extra time. I would! But... you can't do it every day. You can't cope with it... And you'll have no time for your wife. Yes, I will. Because I won't work until very late. I won't, right? Three hours extra at most. You said you've had many blind dates? Yes, so many blind dates. But none of them was successful. Is that? Do you understand? Not successful, right? But... Failures, I would say... What? Nothing, you just spat on my face. Really? It's OK. I'm so sorry. I've had a lot of girlfriends, right? That way I'd have a lot of choices. Right? That's not to say I'm a... playboy. No, not at all. It just means I'd have more choices. But my wife will Be the love of my life. You didn't find anyone suitable amongst them? No. Why not? No one was suitable. Personality clash. With all of them? Or do you have some specific... ideal in mind? So it's hard to find the right one. The main thing is some women... are rather materialistic. They really are! You know what I mean? When I take them out, they want to go to expensive restaurants. Every day. Every meal I think what they love isn't me, the husband, but material luxuries! Well... I see them as failures and interesting experiences. Mr. Wang, if... If your wife... Yes, my wife... ask you to quit betel nut and smoking... Do you drink? No, I don't. Would you quit? Yes, I would. Can you? Yes, I can. I'm not that addicted to betel nut or smoking. I'll Be fine. Miss, if you say... If it's OK... I wonder if you would... marry me? Marry me, please. That's too fast Too fast? Could you... It's all right... we can be... But I mean... If you marry me then I can quit! It's a deal! How about it? I promise. Please think about it. If it's OK with you. You don't have to answer me right away. So... Let's drink a toast! Hello. Are you... the girl On the phone? My name's Tao. Mr. Tao. Yes. You have quite a history! Sure. Since I graduated from high school, I went on to Japan to study. First at Osaka University to become a... manufacturing designer. Then at Tokyo University, I studied psychology and physiology. Then two years of research in Shizuoka. I came back to Taiwan. As I worked in the international trade, I traveled around the world. I've been to America, Europe, Japan and other Asian countries. Later I went to mainland China when they all Owed visits across the strait. So I went to China, and then... After returning to Taiwan, I did a lot of charity work. For example, I worked for a Buddhist charity. We help our brothers and sisters in Taiwan. They are people who are in need. I'm involved in good works. Another job I must tell you about is I teach singing in a senior's home. You teach singing? Yes. May I sing a song for you? OK? It's a nice song. The song of "Everlasting Youth". "We say life begins at the age of seventy." "Eighty's not rare." "Ninety is a dime a dozen." "One hundred is the season of smiles." That's what I do. It makes the old folks happy. It cheers them up. So... May I ask... how old are you? I'm in my thirties. Miss Wu, what else should I tell you about me? You have nothing to ask me? I've been doing all the asking. It's your turn to ask. I have no questions for you. Excuse me, are you Miss Wu? Mr. Lin. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. This is my name card. You're a Scorpio. Scorpio! Scorpios tend to be proud and aloof. People say that but I don't agree. I still don't know what you do. I work in a hospital. In a hospital Yes. Are you a doctor? No, I'm a pharmacist. I think your shoes are very special. They're very pretty and make you look innocent. They're okay. Do you mind if I smoke? Well... Aren't you curious about me? Sorry about the smoke. You... I think your shoes are really really special. You're really into shoes. Yes. Do you mind if we play a game? A psychological Test about shoes. All right. This suitcase... It's full of women's shoes. Yeah, women's shoes. You brought it with you? Yes. Do you want to play the game? How? I put a shoe on you and see how you respond to it. I don't think it's a good idea. It's OK. Let's give it a try. You can't judge a person based on his reaction to a shoe! I bought this one in Paris. If it doesn't fit, would you think there is something with me? No, I wouldn't. Let's give it a try. It's fun, right? Try it! I bought it in Paris. We'll attract attentions. They can't see us in here. Besides, no one will See me under the table! Come on, try it! Wow! It looks so special on you! Want to try another pair? Come on, try another one. Miss Wu... It's eleven thirty in the evening. Thursday night. It's time for me to call you again. I'm fine. Anything you'd like to tell Me about? Professor Lo. Are you looking for furniture? Well, my wife wants to look around. And the kids want to go to McDonald's. I'm tagging along. How are you doing? Why are you still single? I haven't met Mr. Right. Nobody wants me. That can't be true! You're too choosy. No, I think I just haven't met Mr. Right. Some seem okay. But when it comes to marriage... it doesn't feel Right. It's really hard. You haven't met anyone suitable? The good ones are all taken. That can't be true. You should broaden your frequency range. Broaden your frequency range. What do you mean? If you set a very narrow range, like when you tune a radio... Hello? May I ask... May I ask... What do you do? Is she the one? Looks like it. That's her, right? Have you brought anything that proves you're 28 years old? No. No? Well... How old are you? I'll Give you one last chance. How old are you? All right. I'm seventeen. Seventeen years old? I can't believe he told her! Sometimes I'd get dead drunk. Once... actually several times... I ended up sleeping in the street. But usually I'd remember that I have to go to work the next day, and it keeps me from drinking too much. In addition to drinking, you must have other hobbies? Well... Apart from drinking, I like watching adult movies. You know what? It's really fun. Once I came across an old movie starring Ai lijima. It was really interesting. She was still very young. She looked so tanned. There is a beach scene. She is strolling with her boyfriend on the beach. They are walking along. Suddenly three guys turn up and they take hold of her! It was a very powerful scene! It made me so excited. There are other kinds-like S&M. S&M means sadomasochism. The sadist is the attacker while the masochist is the victim. There are different genres. They are shot in different ways. Each kind gives me a different sensation. Actually, if it's possible, I wouldn't mind making one myself. Can you understand? Do you believe that I can tell Fortunes? Can you? Yes, I can. Give me your right hand. Right hand. I see that the time's not right for you to marry. You have many things to enjoy first. Look at this. What it tells is... in your previous life, your marriage was too perfect. So in this life, marriage isn't right for you. But in our society the pressure is always on getting married. You shouldn't give in to it. When should I get married then? I think marriage... Marriage is just a formality. What I have in mind is very simple. We met each other under such circumstances. I'm sincere and I believe you are, too. Or you wouldn't have placed the ad. So how do we advance to the next step? This is what I want to say. No need for unnecessary formalities. My idea is simple, direct, and sincere. I believe that you can see it in my eyes. Although... we met under such circumstances... you really impress me. But how can you... Can you rely on your first impression to know whom to marry? Whom to marry? I... Yes, I am looking for a husband. Actually... I... What I've been trying to say is... Actually, we don't... We don't have to bother with such formalities. You know what I mean? You and I, we know each other, right? You're a woman and I'm a man, we can... Do you get it now? I don't know what you're talking about. What I mean is... to be honest with you... Today I came here, I want to meet a girl. You've left me with a really good impression. I really... I might as well say it. My purpose is... I want to make love to you. You know what I mean? Make love! I think it's only natural. Here we are. We should give it a try. In our society... But I feel nothing for you. Between men and women... the feelings will come once we have done it. Don't you think that's a bit too easy? You pick a girl Off the street. You think she's nice and then you want to sleep with her. But I have my principles. I have my principles about whom I sleep with. She has to be good enough for you. Well, that's it. Because... Why don't you just get a prostitute? I hate the idea. Because when you're through with her... you have to pay her and that feels bad! So you want a free prostitute? No, not really. I've waited several days to meet you... Like waiting for your prey. You shouldn't put it like that. Look, let me be frank with you. I'm thirty-five, married, with a child. So what? No big deal I'm still out there looking for what I want. Marriage certificate is just a piece of paper. You can't take it seriously, can you? Maybe you're right. But... I'm talking from my experiences. Look at the news. Stories about unhappy marriages every day. I think we should stop this discussion. You don't have to... All I can tell You is that I am really sincere. Very sincere in my offer! I think this is a... very romantic place. But we can find an even more romantic place. Check, please! Check. Come on... Miss, the Check! I want you to see how sincere I am. You check! The taxes you pay control our lives. And the politicians control the taxes. I want to ask. I want to know your real motives. Let me introduce myself... I'm the president of the Hsin Mei Corporation. Quite rich! Yes, there are many opportunities. Actually I... Yes, I haven't done much but... Today I went to meet the men as I planned. Every day I take the same bus to the same teahouse. It feels like going to work. Back then I treated my patients. But for these men... No matter how sincere they are, there is nothing I can do for them. Each time I see them, I think of you. I don't mind you not answering the phone. Just let me talk. As I did before. Tell you what happened in my life. You might think I'm crazy. Talking to your answering machine like a mad woman. But if I don't... I think I really will go nuts. I'm advertising for a husband. Advertising? Wow! See how determined I am? Any results? Haven't found the right one yet. Not yet. I think it's my problem. It's not that they're not good enough. I haven't opened up myself yet. But I'll try. Is that relationship really over? You and your ex... Can I ask you something more personal? Hello? Can I ask you something more personal? It depends. Did you sleep with all your boyfriends? Did you sleep with all your boyfriends? Well... It's my turn to ask. Go ahead. But I haven't finished with mine. So? All right, I'll put it another way. Do you do one night stands? No. You think that's... Chia-wen lover here! Sit down. This is Miss Wu. She's my assistant. Sort of secretary. One of my secretaries. Is it taken care off? How is it going? Yes. Just a minute. Hello. Yes, I'll ask her to come over. You talk to her then. Here. You don't do one night stands. What business are you in? You said you would tell me when we met. I think... I'm a freelancer. What kind of freelancer? What kind of freelancer... If I told you, you could earn a lot of money... Would you do it? What kind of work do you do? To be blunt, it's... in the line of the high-class... sex industry. If I told you... Excuse me. You're not into it? Have you ever considered it? This is ridiculous! My ad is very clear! I'm... Looking for a husband! I am looking for a... right! But I just... Why do you doubt what it says in the ad? I don't. No. No? What are you here for? I want to get married, too! Of course I do. I want to get married! But if you need money... I can help you with that. That's impossible for me! That's impossible! Listen, I've met lots of people especially women... Nothing is impossible! If you can think differently, everything is possible! But never mind. Here's my card. If you change your mind... give me a call. Bye. Mr. Chou, can I ask you a few questions? Go ahead. What made you think... because I put up an ad... you have the rights to ask me these questions? I don't know how to answer that. A personal Ad means we can get to know each other. But what on earth... You know nothing about me. Nothing about my background, my past... or anything else. And you assume that I would... Then you want... want to... No, no, wait a minute! No. What is your rationale? My rationale? There's none! I am looking for a wife. But there's no harm asking! Just in case. But the point is... you ask a woman to be a prostitute. Do you need to put it like that? I feel... But that's the business you're in. What made you think... I think you're prejudiced. You discriminate people. All professions are equal, right? A prostitute... as you call It... OK, call her a prostitute. So you look down on her? Because of people like you... I think it's because people like you that they are looked down on. My point is... in your eyes any woman can become a prostitute, right? Do you try this with every woman? No harm asking, right? You behave like an animal asking every woman if she'd go with you... Not with me. I think you're over-reacting. If you don't want to do it, it's not a big deal. If I get a job in the presidential palace, I'll Ask you to join me. That should be good enough for you. Hello, sorry I missed your call Please leave a message Please pick up the phone. I'm sick! I feel So awful. Have you gone back to your wife? Please pick up the phone. Please... One hundred and fifty. Thanks! - Thanks! What troubles me most is... I made up my mind to do something. And it's the right thing to do. It's the right thing for me. But I just can't do it. I can't make it. I feel That I can't make it. You don't get it? Well... For example, I feel... it's very painful when I see him. So I think I should put an end to it. But when I don't get to see him, the pain is even worse. It all boils down to your choice. Choose what you can endure. Mr. Yu, was it you who called me? Yes, it was me. I didn't know you'd bring your father. Actually, it's him who's looking for a wife. Go on. But you... But how about your mother? My mother has gone living abroad. She may never come back. Because... She is a modern woman. She prefers what life abroad can offer. I'm sorry. I don't quite get it. I mean... your mother has gone abroad, right? Right. She's gone, but she'll be back, right? It's pretty unlikely. Unlikely? Yes. Unlikely, but if she does come back... If she does, then we'll be in trouble. So... You get a lot of phone calls? Uh, yes. People are always calling me. Miss Wu, you're nearsighted? Yes. How serious? Quite serious but they're for astigmatism. Why is that? Because contact lenses are no good for astigmatism. You wear a contact for nearsightedness and glasses for astigmatism? Right. You are nearsighted, too. How serious? I'm... I'm astigmatic. My right eye is nearsighted and left eye is astigmatic. It's really a pain. Mr. Ho, there's something weird about you. Me? Yes. What do you mean? My manners or my looks? It's just everything about you. Well, I guess maybe it has to do with my profession. Do you know what I do? No, Sorry, I forgot. But you look like a fortuneteller. Really? Yes. A fortuneteller? You know what? I'm a painter. A fortuneteller... I mean, you could be a painter, too... May I order a drink? Of course. Excuse me. A beer, please! Hello, hello. Sorry. Mr. Ho, your leg... Anything wrong with it? Yes. I have a bad leg. What about it? When you walked over there, you were limping. And then you weren't. When you walked back, you were limping again. I always walk with a limp. No, you don't. You were talking and getting excited. At that point, you seemed fine. Really? I wasn't limping when I was on the phone? No, you weren't. And I think your beard is fake, too. My beard! All right! You're right. My leg is fine. But I thought if I came as a disabled person, I met you and you could accept that... you would be a very special girl. That was what I thought. But my beard is real You look very familiar to me. Really? Me... familiar? Yes. You look familiar to me, too. No, I mean, I've seen you somewhere. And I recognize your voice, too. I went to Ching Hsin Elementary School. I went to Fu Hsin. You could be a classmate of my cousin's. Maybe I met you when I visited my cousin! OK, I've gone too far. So I look familiar... But you know we artists... From time to time, we appear on TV. Maybe it's possible that... You should stop! Ying. I know I've seen you before. I've seen you in all those different roles. In various performances. So in my mind... All right. So you found me out. I'm an actor. Sorry, it's so hot. Do I really look like a fortuneteller? The hat must have given me away. Do you know my name? No, I haven't... My surname is Niu. Doze Niu! Yes. I've seen you in the movie, Growing Up. Is that right? You were a kid then. I went... Did you like it? I liked it but you haven't acted for a while, right? I don't think I've seen you... What are you doing now? I'm still acting. I guess you don't watch much TV. See my hand? I was in a Hong Kong movie with Andy Lau. I hurt my hand then. You know... We were filming at the night market. I was playing Andy's sidekick... We were investigators... It was really crowded. The killer was about to strike, I rushed to save the hero... Then... whoops! Mr. Niu. Yes? This is ridiculous. What? You feel bored? No. Of course, it's ridiculous. It's a movie. We have to finish shooting. Besides, I felt very honored... No, not your movie. I mean our meeting here. It's ridiculous. Why? Because I'm looking for a husband. You don't want to get married... Then... Wait a minute. You're here to make fun of me. No, I'm not. What I want to say is... I do want to settle down. You know what? Excuse me... Hello! That's right, I'm in Tianmu. Your girlfriend? Yes, she's a nuisance. She keeps asking me what I'm doing. She keeps calling me. I told her I was with friends. And she hung up on me. Then she called again. Mr. Niu, I... I want a more settled life. I don't think your lifestyle would suit me. Your life is too complicated. It's OK. I just... Hang on... People say our lives are complicated... But in fact... Your girlfriend's waiting for you. That's all right. I can leave you my number. I've got your number. Oh, right. Where do I pay? Let me. No, I'll Do it. I suppose you're meeting other people? Take care. I should stop limping! I was wondering what kind of woman would take such an action. Putting a personal Ad in not only a paper but a major one. A major newspaper. I was thinking, "Is she an ugly girl"? That would make sense but you're not ugly at all. Well... I can't tell that myself. Has the ad been there long? Quite a few days, right? Yeah, a few days. How about the people you've met? They're OK. All men? Of course. I'm looking for a man. Of course they're all men. Have you had any experience? What experience? Experience like mine. Experience with somebody like me. Have you? I mean have you ever thought about the unhappy relationships you had. Unhappy relationships? Have you ever wondered why the relationships made you unhappy? Was it because of your personality? Or his? Or maybe it was because of the gender? The gender? Could be the cause. If you haven't tried it, you wouldn't know, would you? What haven't I tried? Don't get nervous. I don't want to make you nervous. Can I be blunt? Can I ask you a personal Question? Sure. Are you... a man or a woman? Because... - Good. I'm sorry. - Good. I was waiting for you to ask that. I feel You are so nervous. No, it's because... I'm sorry... It's okay. Don't be nervous. It's really nothing! No, because I get the impression that... I'm a woman! I think it depends on how you see it. No, I... Depending on from which angle you make your judgment. So you're a woman. Am I a man, or a woman? So you're a woman. If you say so. I have the characteristics of a woman. But I'm looking for a man. I'm a man. What I'm looking for is a "real" man. You can think about it. No! I'm not one of you... Sorry, I'm not saying lesbians are... I have nothing against lesbians. But I want a man. I'm not a lesbian. I like women! But you're clearly lesbian. I'm not and I like women. You're a woman, and you like women. Of course you are. You're lesbian! I'm sorry. I... Actually many people have told me that. But like what I just told you things aren't either black or white. But for me... There is a gray area. You're either a man or black... Sorry, no, either a man or a woman... Either black or white. As simple as that. How do you know if you don't try? You've never tried it before, right? But I don't want to try. I know what I want. Why don't you try men? I mean, give men a try. Men are not bad! There's something in your hair. It's OK. I'll get it. I'm sorry. Your ears sit high on your head. Higher than most people. My family said my ears were higher than my eyebrows. So it seems... Yeah, it's a sign of intelligence. Your ears are higher than your eyebrows, too. You're talking about yourself! You're very smart. I think I respond to things quicker than most people. I'm a salesman. I sell personal protection devices. Our company has many products. Just think about it. You may be mugged or robbed at any time. Raped or kidnapped for ransom and all sort of crimes. It's like when you're watching a TV drama and bang, a commercial comes in. We don't have to put up with it, do we? So I think... Let me ask you frankly. How could you protect yourself? This is a mace-type spray. A combination of chill and mustard. It's not the chili you cook with nor the mustard for your sashimi. Just press lightly and spray. Careful! Don't worry. There... So many bad people are out there. But don't get scared. Look at this shock stick. It is adjustable and very light. You can handle it with one hand. Even if a robber has an axe or a blade, a sword or a chopper, you just press this trigger. Don't be afraid! This is an 80,000 volt stunner. 80,000 volt! Even the mosquitoes get zapped. So do the flies. It'll send the robbers straight to the hospital. It's a bargain. It costs $8,000. I can give you a discount. It's really useful You may wonder what a stunner is. Right? This is called "The Demon". It has two switches. A safety and the "on" switch. Don't be afraid... This one is a 200,000 volt stunner. 200,000 volt. When it touches the robber, his four limbs will fall off immediately. He'll be stunned out of his wits. This costs only $3,500. A small Price for peace and safety. I recommend this one in particular. This is called "The Tracker". It has a special... A specially designed grip. Easy to handle. It won't harm you. It took a Canadian policeman 7 years to invent it. Once you spray the dye his face will Be covered with it like a mask. His eyes will Be totally blinded. And this one here, look... Hey, don't press it! I'm sorry. - It's OK. It's alright... I'll sort it out. Excuse me... No, what I mean is... Your voice seems different from others. Different? Of course. That's my job. I'm a voice actor. I can speak in all kinds of different voices. That's how I earn my living. Why did you put an ad in the paper? You look pretty good to me. Should there be a reason? Of course. I'd have thought it's for old people. But you are not old. Maybe you have been hurt... I don't know. Or you have some illness? I want to get married. You want to marry, so do I. My life feel S empty. I always speak for other people. I don't like it. So that's why you're here. Yes. I want to see what kind of girl you are. To meet people outside my circle. Not bad, you seem gentle and quiet. Exactly the kind of girl I'm looking for. I talk all day long. I talk and fidget a lot. I'm looking for a quiet girl who can calm me down. She'd listen to me and put me at ease. But if you're talking all day long, shouldn't you... You're such a lovely girl. Why are you so serious? I'm not. You're not? You are not at peace with yourself, right? You're so sharp. You must read a lot. It has nothing to do with books. What then? You can't tell Can you? I can tell that you feel very insecure. It's not that I can't tell... It's because you're very insecure. Cool. It's not that. I feel Very... I can tell it from your body language. Look, you keep touching things and scratching your head. You keep fidgeting. It's a sign of insecurity. No, it's not. Are you aware of your insecurity? That's why you're looking for a husband. You want someone to look after you, to protect you. Have you found one? No. I... I'm still looking. That's my point. I've met many people. I'm still looking. I'm trying hard. Cool. So cool. Very cool. I'm trying hard to find the right person. So I say I'm the guy who can give you security. You think you can? You're even wearing sun glasses. I can't even see your eyes. I wear them all the time. I feel Secure with them on. No need to look anyone in the eyes. That proves you're insecure as well. I just don't like looking straight into the eyes. I think it's kind of rude. But the eyes are important. They tell you whether one is! Ying or not. This discussion is getting too serious. We want to be partners not opponents. You're a lovely girl. Why do you need to be so defensive? No, I... I don't think I'm insecure. Aren't there women who do dubbing? But they're strange. You know... Can you do a few lines? A few lines? What do you think I am? An acrobat? When you meet a clown, would you say to him, "hey, do somersaults" or "play a few tricks for me"? It's not what I meant. Maruko, stop fooling around. Have you finished your homework yet? I bet you haven't. Your teacher will Call me tomorrow. Go do your homework! Miyuki, we have to work hard. We must solve the case to save my grandfather's honor. I can do all sorts of strange voices. Look, I can do this. Miyuki, we must work hard in order to... Maybe I'm not the right man for you. And you're not suitable for me. Why don't I just admit it that this isn't the right way to find a partner. I'm just trying to occupy myself with something to ease the pain you left me. Today, a guy asked me if I was seeking revenge? Am I? He said our meeting was only an opportunity for me to reject him. Or like what Sisy Chen told me. I can treat the whole process as a ceremony. I saw her in a restaurant the other day. I wanted to know what she'd do if she was in my shoes. I've been thinking... If you don't regard time as something static but ongoing... For example, imagine yourself as a scriptwriter... Or imagine that you are a director... Then you know that a story can be developed. Time doesn't stop at any precise moment. Since it doesn't stop you'll see what happens in the later development. In that case, you won't feel that particular moment is so important. You look at the world as a whole. It won't stop for your tears. You know it's only a process. Moreover, you may discover... If you don't take the responsibility for your sadness... or bear the burden yourself... You think you had hurt someone... Actually you'll hurt him more in the long run. The pain will last longer. So if you have come to realize this, you'd be brave enough to deal with it. But I feel that from what you just said, you're the one who takes the initiative to end the relationship... It's not you who cries. No, not really. For example, he's the one who wants to end it, right? In that case, you're forced to accept it. You should follow my advice. But you'd say you feel so miserable. There are two ways. Normally I'd tell people this... You feel desperate so you want to kill yourself, right? But before you do yourself in... Go watch a funeral ceremony anywhere in Taiwan... You'll See how ugly the curtains are. How awful the coffin looks. How ugly you'd be dressed. And the terrible funeral music! That'll make you realize it's better to live after all. Your pain will be eased to some degree. So you... decide which music instruments to buy... Yes, the company runs the business. There are many people in the office. But they know nothing about the instruments... They're businessmen. So you he! P them choose? Yes. What else do you do? Have you ever worn a nurse's uniform? No? You like women in nurse's uniforms? Yes. They look nice in the uniform. They look so innocent. I don't mean they're not innocent if they don't wear them. What the hell Am I talking about? Where do girls like to go? It depends. I think... girls often end up following the guys. Really? Yeah. What if he's into something weird? How weird? To be honest with you, I really like going to... Here it is! Let me show you first. Press this. Here. Hit it like this. Harder! Let me. You've got to watch the back. Come on. Come on! Can you tell jokes? Jokes! The funniest joke is... At this point, all I need is about... six or seven hundred thousand dollars! Do you wear a nurse's nu-niform? Nurse's nu-niform. Nurse's U-Nl-FORM. Nurse's NU-IN-FORM. 168cm tall. And she must look cute and sweet. That'd suit me better. I am his mother. Shouldn't he know when he wants a drink? And when he doesn't? He does. He's just too nervous. Give the g! Ass to Mama. Good boy. Mrs. Cheng, I think he... What do you think of him? What do you think? Let me put it this way... Do you think he's fit for marriage? Marriage! I think he is. Really? He can't even look after himself. How can he... I'm looking for someone to look after me. He can look after people. He's just too nervous today. He's so used to living in the world of his own. Then he's fine with himself. Why do you want to marry him off? People must marry. Humans are social animals. But only people who are competent should get married. He is competent. It's just that he lives in the world of his own. If there is some kind of switch that would open him up... Perhaps you could be that switch... You mustn't say that... I don't think so. Besides... He's just... a little... You could give it a try. Try to be his friend. Or just be with him. He's not used to the outside world. We get along well. He even shares his spiritual life with me. He can look after himself. Mrs. Cheng. Take it easy. Are you nervous? Relax. We're here for coffee. It's okay. Mom will Drink it later. He wants me to drink, see? It's all right. Mom will Drink it later. Mom will drink it later, all Right? He wants me to drink. He probably thinks I'm too nervous. No one is perfect. Maybe you think he's sick but I don't. I didn't say he's sick. But, I think... I suggest you shouldn't do it again. Alright, I understand how you feel But should you be willing... Maybe you can think it over. Maybe you can be his friend. Let's forget about getting married. Just be friends. Try to enter his world. We Chinese always talk about "ching". The character "ching" has two parts: One means "heart", the other means "green" The color green... We all agree that "green" signifies life or rebirth. So when we say the word "ching", it means something ongoing not something that burns out quickly. It involves consideration, responsibility and care. Love has no responsibility. Love is an instinct. For example, love is sex. It's biologically driven. But "ching" entails commitment and consideration. I'm Yu Wen, you're... My name is Wu... How do you do? You're really thirsty. No, usually I bring my own... When you meet these guys, who pays the bills? Sometimes they do, sometimes we go Dutch... I can pay for it. I have a good impression of you... Thank you. Let me tell you about myself first. I mean, let's not waste time. I don't want to go on and on. I'll Tell you straight. All the good and bad things about me. The good thing is I'm very good! I mean I have a good heart. Yes. That's the truth. Really. It's hard to boast about yourself. Bad things are easier to talk about. First of all, I'm kind of a loner. I thought about it all night... In fact, I've been thinking about it for more than ten years... More than twenty years! I'm forty-five. I'm somewhat reclusive. Like after work, I go home and I'd just sit there daydreaming. Sometimes I think of something... What do you do? I teach Chinese in an elementary school I'm often lost in daydreaming. I'd sit there for a long time as still as a bonsai. I can't be like this after I get married. If you were my wife, I would have to... But I'm trying to become more outgoing... My students like me. They say sometimes I'm quite funny. The other thing is I'm thrifty. Thrifty... stingy! People think I'm stingy. But... I'm not really stingy! I... just got used to it. I do spend when I need to. Well, I'm influenced by my mom. My mom is thrifty because our family was poor. Then my parents had become used to it. I thought if she alone was thrifty, she'd feel Lonely. So I became thrifty to keep her company. My parents live in the south. They're in their eighties. They're old and hope I'll marry soon. I would like to marry, have a child and a family of my own. I didn't want to get married because I thought that life was too fragile. The thought of aging and dying of illness was unbearable. If my wife, my child, my family... became old and sick and dead, I would feel... it's too much to bear. Now I'm getting older... Getting... I've changed. I'm able to accept these things. So I've said it all So now... you know all Good and bad things about me. What do you think? Can we be friends or something closer? What do you think? I haven't thought about it yet. I'm so sure of my feelings for you. You haven't even heard me speak. And you're so sure of your feelings? I know what I'm talking about. I'm not dumb! I can see you're very... nice. Very nice. How do you know? You have a pretty forehead. You can see that from my forehead? It looks very intelligent, very dignified. And your eyes are like a child's. They're smiling and full of wonder. They look pure. And you... you smiled twice. Your smiles are so sweet. Have you heard a song called, "Everlasting Smile"? My father used to sing it while courting my mother. "My love..." "Feel not sorrow nor dejection" "I wish only that your smile," "Goes on forever." The last line is really great! A very simple line. Yet it conveys so much emotion. Your forehead looks like my mother's. Mine is like my dad's, a bit broad. It's very hard so I was nicknamed "Iron Head". It makes a noise when you hit it. Very loud noise. It didn't hurt at all Not at all. That's how I used to bully my classmates. Can we be frank now? Can you say whether you would be willing to be with me? I mean you don't have to meet any more men after this. Or if you do meet them, tell them to go away. Don't you think this is a little too sudden? But life is short. But you just said you spent over twenty years deciding whether to get married or not. And now... We've only spent ten, twenty minutes. The bad things about me aren't really bad. They're just my habits. My characteristics. I can make changes, too. If you want me to change, I can... But I have no such plans. If you think I'm stingy... If you want a new dress or to eat at a steakhouse... Whatever you say, I'd... If I want to buy a new dress with your month's salary? Of course you can. Are you sure? I really want to take you to meet my parents. How happy would they be! I always meet these men here. Where we came for our first date. I choose different tables depending on how I feel and who I'm meeting that day... But no matter where I sit, I always feel Secure. I can become another person and hide my real Self. My only fear is if one day you walk in all Of sudden, what should I do? It was raining really hard that day. I was riding my bike. A bus went pass. I got splashed and soaked through. I didn't want to meet you like that. So I didn't come up. Have you always been so timid and unsure of yourself? Actually, I spent time in jail. I was inside for a year and a ha! F. Are you surprised to hear this? It had nothing to do with me. My father was passing bad checks. He couldn't pay back the money, so I... I hope you aren't put off. I worked as a mail inspector while I was in jail. I looked well -behaved. So I was asked to check the mails. I read people's letters every day. It was fun. I got to know their secrets. I was engaged before I went in. But she left me soon after. I don't blame her. Everyone wants to marry a decent guy. Do you tell This to every girl You meet? About... No. It's not something I'm proud of. Then why did you tell me? I didn't want to waste your time. I had gone out with a few girls. I didn't tell them at first. But when I did tell them, they... started to avoid me and gradually disappeared. So I thought... I feel Something for this guy. I think our relationship would not end in this place. What makes me feel this way isn't his looks or his frankness. He had this strange smile. It looks like my own. A smile of awkwardness and helplessness. Surely you can understand it. Others may not but you definitely can. But what should I do with him? He suggested we could go fishing. But I thought we should sleep with each other. Do you know how scared I was? I was so scared. It was the first time the hospital terrified me. Lying on the operating table... I really prayed for the courage to keep the baby. But I didn't. So heartless of me. Where were you then? Where were you? Do you know I get so scared every time I come home? Like I just said. Honestly, these things I'm telling you to do... I probably couldn't do myself. Choose what you can endure and move on. But I've endured so much pain! Pain makes you rise above everything. If everything goes smoothly, you'd never grow up. Actually... I'm not really attracted to women. What do you mean? I like men. I knew this from a very young age. But I also knew I wanted to lead a "normal" life. You're not saying this just to console me? Making your life so much worse so I'll feel better. No, what about you? And your troubles? My life seems a bit better than yours. Are you Mr. Wang? Is that Miss Wu? Yes. Can you help me? I'm Mr. Wang. Can I take your arm? Sorry. Have you been waiting long? That's all right. Here. Please have a seat. Thank you. Mr. Wang, your eyes... My eyes? - Completely? Yes, completely blind. Were you born blind? Yes. Did the doctor say anything about it? Atrophy of the optic nerve. Then how could you read my ad? I didn't. My friend told me about it. And I gave you a call. I am sorry. What do you do apart from being a musician? Nothing really. But sometimes if I need extra money, I'd go busking in the pedestrian tunnel. The tunnel? Yes. You probably gave me money before. You just don't remember. Which tunnel? Any tunnel Next time maybe you'll see me there again. Please be generous! I don't think your name is Wu. It is Wu. Your surname is Tu, isn't it? Don't you recognize me? Do I look familiar? Several years ago, you treated my eyes. You're an eye doctor, aren't you? Dr. Tu. Are you okay? Yes, my name is Tu Chia-chen. I'm sorry. I meant no harm. No, I'm sorry... I really meant no harm. No, I'm sorry I shouldn't have lied. When we spoke on the phone, I thought it was you. Why? I recognized your voice. I was your patient. Your voice sounded familiar on the phone. You should be Dr. Tu. How could it be Wu? So I felt I must come. But I apologize. On the phone, I said my eyes were bad. I didn't tell you I was blind. Are you disappointed? It's just that I didn't expect... Not disappointed? I thought... I didn't expect a blind person would turn up and consider... It's natural that you're disappointed. Yeah. But why do you call yourself Wu? Isn't Tu good enough? - Actually... Tu! Have you got used to being Miss Wu? I sometimes forget. Often? When you've been! Ying long enough... Our eyes can never lie. You can be Miss Wu or Miss Tu. No disrespect intended. I can never lie because of my eyes. My eyes are a kind of marks on me. I can never see anything. So I might as well not tell any lies. When you realize I was Dr. Tu on the phone, weren't you afraid? Why should I be afraid? I was being cheeky... I wanted to expose you. My name isn't the issue. I just wanted to be cut off from my past. But using another surname as a disguise... Do you enjoy it? When you've been! Ying long enough, you'll get used to it. Is that so? But I don't enjoy it. Sometimes, I feel It's absurd. I'm looking for a husband. But I can't tell him my real Surname. But... It's possible that I could meet someone with whom I'd spend the rest of my life. In that case, I'm probably I think I should stop meeting these men. Because I find it scary. Each time I meet someone, without hesitation, he tells me his secrets, his desires. I feel I wasn't talking to him but peeping through the keyhole. They are always in the light. And I'm in the shadows. But how do I get in the light? Hello? - I... Hello? Doctor Tu? I'm sorry... It's me who should apologize. I've been listening to your calls. I should say I've been eavesdropping. Are you Mrs. Wu? Yes. I've been back in Taiwan for some time. I listened to your messages by accident. I know it's weird to let you call Every day. I'm sorry. I didn't know you had come back. I came here after the accident. The accident? So you don't know my husband's dead. He flew from Phnom Penh to catch a plane back to Taiwan. The plane crashed in Vietnam. Dr. Tu, I know it's hard for you to bear. It's hard for me, too. But today I was determined to speak to you on the phone To tell you that you should stop calling. He's no longer here to answer it. The last time he came to me was to tell me about your affair. He told me you were pregnant and you wanted the baby. I knew him too well. It took a lot for him to tell me this. He kept apologizing but he was adamant. I cried. So did he. He left very early next morning. After the accident, I was full of hate. I hated him and I hated you even more. How could you bring such disaster to my family? He was willing to give everything up for the sake of a woman I'd never even met?! After the first message, I hoped you'd keep calling. I wanted to know everything between you two. Some evenings, I sat waiting for your call At times I was so tempted to pick up the phone and scream. But I can't listen to you anymore. I feel... I'm doing something really cruel I answered the phone today just to ask you to stop. Fate has been unfair to all of us. At first I felt satisfaction from your misery. But now I've calmed down. I know at last why things happened the way they did. Listening to your messages made me realize I never committed myself to him as you did. I can't do that for anyone. So why should I bear grudges? Thank you for bringing peace to me. I can now bring myself to face a new life. Wu Chia-chen, how are you? I don't know what to say. This is my second message today. If it's possible, can I see you again? To give up now would be too easy. If you don't want to contact me, I'll Drop by the teahouse. Maybe we'll run into each other.
