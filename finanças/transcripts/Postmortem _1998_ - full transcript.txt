(baby crying) (screaming) (alarm clock beeping) (car door closing) (car engine starting up) NO BUFFALO WINGS, NO FERNS, NO YUPPIE DICK HEADS IN DESIGNER JEANS ORDERING IMPORTED LIGHT LAGER. ALL I ASK IN A BAR. Maddie: YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT HERE, JIMMY. HERE’S LUNCH. Maddie: OH, YOU DRINK TOO FAST. YOU’LL BE DRUNK IN NO TIME. WHERE I’M HEADED TODAY, MADDIE, NO MAN SHOULD HAVE TO FACE SOBER. I’LL GO AGAIN. I THINK THE THING THAT STRIKES ME MOST ABOUT YOUR BOOK IS IT’S SENSITIVITY. IT’S UMM... IT’S DEPTH. I MEAN, HERE YOU ARE THIS, HIGHLY DECORATED DETECTIVE, WHO’S QUITE THE INTERNATIONAL LEGEND. AND NOT JUST FOR YOUR CRIME-SOLVING, BUT FOR YOUR WILD, WILD WAYS. AND YET, YOU APPEAR TO HAVE SUCH... COMPASSION FOR THE KILLER YOU’RE HUNTING. IT’S MORE OF AN UNDERSTANDING RATHER THAN COMPASSION. OH, YES, WELL... CALL IT WHAT YOU WILL, IT’S PRETTY EMOTIONAL STUFF, AND IT HAS MADE FOR SOME CRITICISM. I MEAN, HERE WE HAVE THE WORST CHILD KILLER SINCE UH... OH, THAT FELLOW FROM ATLANTA? WILLIAM WILSON. RIGHT. NINE, YOUNG VICTIMS, YET YOU DEVOTED TWO WHOLE CHAPTERS TO THE KILLER’S, ALBERT SMITH’S CHILDHOOD. HIS CHILDHOOD WAS A HELL ON EARTH. I’M NOT CONDONING HIS MURDER SPREE. BUT TO UNDERSTAND HIS TWISTED INTERNAL LOGIC, HELPED ME FIND HIM. YES. BUT, IT COMES ACROSS AS PITY. DID YOU EVEN READ THE BOOK? OR JUST THE JACKET LIKE THE LAST FIVE IDIOTS WHO INTERVIEWED ME. UH, I CAN ASSURE YOU I’VE READ EVERY SINGLE WORD, AND IT’S EXCELLENT! RIGHT, WE’LL GO TO A BREAK NOW, BUT, WELL BE BACK SHORTLY WITH JAMES MACGREGOR... James: NO YOU WON’T. ...AND HIS BEST SELLER, "MIND CRASH". James: I JUST FELT REALLY BAD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER TODAY, AND MAYBE YOU’D LIKE TO GIVE ME A CHANCE TO APOLOGIZE. PROPERLY, THAT IS. OR, MAYBE YOU’D LIKE TO COME BY. I HAVE A LOVELY HOUSE, RIGHT HERE ON THE WATER. HAVEN’T HAD A WHOLE LOT OF CHANCE TO DECORATE IT THOUGH. YOU DON’T SAY? (door bell) YOU LIKE DECORATING? I LIKE DECORATING TOO. JUST ONE SECOND. HI, WHAT DO I OWE YOU? TWO. KEEP IT. YEAH? SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY? LATER’S GOOD. UH, HUH, SAY, AROUND 10:00 OR SO? CREEPY. NO, NO, NO. NOT YOU, NOT YOU AT ALL. SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN, THEN? EXCELLENT, I’LL SEE YOU THEN. BYE-BYE. (fax machine ringing) LEAVE ME ALONE. (laughing) YEAH. I THINK, UH... I’D JUST BETTER GO. NO, NO. NO, HEY! UH! DUMB DRUNK! CALL ME WHEN YOU’RE SOBER. (fax machine ringing) (glasses breaking) SHIT! SON OF A BITCH. (melody alarm going off) (police sirens) LET’S SEE THE HANDS UP! KEEP YOUR HANDS OUT IN FRONT OF YOU. STAND UP NICE AND SLOWLY. YOU KNOW THE PROCEDURE. OKAY, SEARCH HIM. TELL ME WHAT’S HAPPENING HERE? I UNDERSTAND IF YOU’RE FAMOUS IN CALIFORNIA, YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH MURDER. WELCOME TO SCOTLAND. WHAT DID YOU THINK? ONE LOUSY BEST-SELLER AND SUDDENLY YOU’RE ABOVE THE LAW? GOOD MORNING. HOW MUCH YOU’VE BEEN DRINKING? DID YOU BLACK OUT? MAYBE YOU DON’T REMEMBER WHAT YOU DID LAST NIGHT, IS THAT POSSIBLE? BITE ME. WE HAVE A MURDER WEAPON. WE HAVE BLOOD... NO, YOU HAVE A CARVING KNIFE, WITH MY BLOOD, MY CUT. WE DID A PRELIM ON THE BODY. THERE’S NOT SO MUCH AS A SCRATCH ON THE GIRL. MAYBE SHE TRIED TO MATCH MACGREGOR DRINK FOR DRINK, AND 0.D.’D. YOU TRY TO MATCH ME, IT’D BE SUICIDE, WHICH MEANS CASE CLOSED. AND YOU CAN GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE. PLEASE... DID YOU HAVE A GIRL IN HERE LAST NIGHT, SIR? YEAH. I THINK SO. YOU, THINK SO? PRETTY SURE I DID. IT SAYS: "BELOVED DAUGHTER OF THEODORE AND JOANNE, SISTER OF PAUL, CAROL AND BERNADETTE." WHAT IS THIS, AN OBITUARY? I DON’T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU DON’T KNOW? LETS GO AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE BODY. MAYBE THAT WILL REFRESH YOUR MEMORY. YOU LEAD... I HAVEN’T SEEN HER BEFORE. SO WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING IN YOUR BACKYARD? SO, YOU’RE IN YOUR OWN HOUSE GETTING PISSED, BUT SOMEHOW YOU END UP WITH AN OBITUARY OF A VERY RECENTLY DECEASED GIRL WITH BLOOD ALL OVER HER. AND SOMEHOW THAT GIRL ENDS UP DEAD IN YOUR BACK GARDEN. CAN YOU TELL ME HOW THAT MAKES ANY SENSE? WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A TELEPHONE CALL, MR. MACGREGOR? TO YOUR AGENT MAYBE, A SOLICITOR, YOUR OFF-LICENSE? YOUR WIFE? I’VE GOT A BARTENDER WHO’S REALLY COUNTING ON ME. I WOULDN’T MIND DOWNING A COUPLE OF PINTS, WHAT DO YOU SAY? OH, ACTUALLY IT WOULD BE A HELL OF A LOT MORE FUN. LET’S GO OVER THIS AGAIN. Gwen: MR. MACGREGOR, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN GLASGOW? James: ABOUT SIX MONTHS. Gwen: WHY DID YOU MOVE HERE? FOR THE WEATHER. REALLY? IS YOUR FAMILY FROM HERE? YEAH. GRANDFATHER. I NEEDED A BREAK. SEARCHING FOR MY ROOTS, PEACE AND QUIET. WHEN YOU LEFT THE POLICE FORCE IN SAN FRANCISCO ABOUT TWO AND HALF YEARS AGO YOU WERE DIAGNOSED AS HAVING ACUTE INSOMNIA AND CLINICAL DEPRESSION. YOU SAID, "MY MIND SNAPPED. I’D SEEN AND SMELLED ONE DEATH TOO MANY. I WANT OUT BEFORE I HURT SOMEBODY." IT’S A GOOD QUOTE. YOU KNOW, YOU WERE QUITE THE HERO AROUND HERE FOR SOMETIME. EVERYONE IN THE DEPARTMENT READ YOUR BOOK. I READ IT TWICE MYSELF. I COULD USE THE ROYALTIES. WHEN WE HEARD YOU WERE MOVING TO OUR GREAT CITY, WE WERE EXCITED I TELL YOU. COULDN’T IMAGINE WE’D BE MEETING LIKE THIS THOUGH. AREN’T YOU THIRSTY? I’M THIRSTY. WITH THIS ONE, THE SMITH CASE, WHY WAS IT SO UNSETTLING? EVER SEEN A TWO-YEAR-OLD COOKED IN A FURNACE BEFORE? YOU HAVEN’T, HAVE YOU? I DIDN’T THINK SO. WE GOT AN I.D. ON THE GIRL, LINDA SYMES. HER FATHER’S THEODORE SYMES, CEO OF IRELAND MIDLAND SAVINGS. GREAT, THE PRESS WILL EAT IT UP. THOSE NAMES IN THE OBIT, THEODORE, JOANNE, IT’S HER IMMEDIATE FAMILY. ALRIGHT, CARRY ON. EYES SLIGHTLY MOIST, TRACES OF DECOMPOSITION. SHE’S JUST BEYOND SECOND STAGE RIGOR MORTIS. BEST GUESS, LEO? I’D SAY EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. WHAT’S UNUSUAL, ABSOLUTELY NO TRAUMA OTHER THAN THE NEEDLE MARK AND... THIS. Gwen: WHAT IS IT? AN EMBALMING PUNCTURE, SHE’S BEEN DRAINED OF HER BLOOD POSTMORTEM. NO EVIDENCE OF ANY SEXUAL CONTACT, THE BODY HAS NOT BEEN DEFILED IN ANY OTHER WAY. IT’S ALL VERY CLEAN. IT DOESN’T LOOK LIKE THE WORK OF A GUY ON A BENDER. Gwen: LAB CONFIRMS THAT MACGREGOR’S PRINTS WERE THE ONLY ONES FOUND ON THE FAX. NO BIG SURPRISE THERE, BUT WHAT WE DIDN’T KNOW IS THAT FIRST WAS THE ACTUAL TIME OF TRANSMISSION, BECAUSE HE DID A LOUSY JOB - OF RIPPING IT OUT OF THE MACHINE. - 6:43 FRIDAY RIGHT. WHEN WAS SYMES LAST SEEN ALIVE? HER SISTER, BERNADETTE, SAID THAT SHE LEFT FOR HER BOYFRIEND’S AT ABOUT 8:00. THE BOYFRIEND CALLED ABOUT 9:15 SAYING THAT SHE NEVER SHOWED UP. AND HE CHECKED OUT OKAY? THE KID’S A CHOIRBOY, AT HOME WITH HIS PARENTS. SO, LET’S SAY A FAX AT 6:45, ABDUCTION BETWEEN 8:00 AND 9:00. Wallace: THAT’S AS PREMEDITATED AS IT GETS. Balantine: WHERE WAS MACGREGOR BETWEEN 8:00 AND 9:00? HMMM, AT HOME. HE ORDERED INDIAN FROM A LOCAL DELIVERY AND CARRY-OUT SERVICE. DELIVERY BOY WAS THERE AT ABOUT 8:30. THE KID REMEMBERS HIM, SAYS HE WAS TOO PISSED, TOO MESSED UP TO DRIVE THE HALF HOUR IT WOULD TAKE HIM TO GET TO OR FROM LINDA SYMES. SAYS HE WAS A BIG SPENDER TOO. GAVE HIM A TIP OF 20 QUID. OH, AND I’VE FOUND HIS LADY VISITOR, OUR VERY OWN LOCAL CELEBRITY, JANE ST. JOHN. SHE SAID SHE WAS THERE AT ABOUT 10:00 AND LEFT A BIT AFTER MIDNIGHT. SHE CONFIRMS HE COULDN’T HAVE DRIVEN ANYWHERE. RELEASE HIM. (phone ringing) YEAH? Jane: JAMES? ARE YOU ALRIGHT? - THE POLICE SAID-- - WHO IS THIS? IT’S JANE, JANE ST. JOHN. I’M REALLY SORRY ABOUT ALL OF THIS, JANE. - I HOPE THEY DIDN’T PUT YOU THROUGH IT TOO HARD. - NO. I’M FINE. LISTEN... IF YOU NEED TO TALK... NO, I’M SORRY, NO MORE INTERVIEWS. (fax machine ringing) I JUST GOT ANOTHER OBIT. (car horn) WE PUT A TRACE ON BOTH OF MACGREGOR’S LINES. THE FAX CAME FROM A BOOTLEGGED MOBILE. IT’S A HUGE SCAM, YOU’LL NOT TRACE IT. - GWENNIE? - EVERY NEW MISSING PERSON’S REPORT FOR FEMALES HAS TO INCLUDE THE NAMES OF ALL IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS. SO FAR, NOTHING ON THIS WOMAN. HOW CAN WE MAKE USE OF THIS? ON THE LAST ONE WE HAD A WINDOW OF TWO OR THREE HOURS. EVEN IF WE WANTED TO, WE COULD NOT HAVE PUT OUT OUR NEWS BULLETIN. WHAT COULD WE SAY? "IF YOUR FATHER’S HENRY AND YOUR SISTER’S HEATHER, YOU COULD BE DEAD. BE CAREFUL." THIS BUGGER WILL JUST STRIKE ELSEWHERE. - WHY IS HE DOING IT? - BECAUSE HE’S A SICK BASTARD. ALRIGHT. WHY MACGREGOR? WELL, HOOKING MACGREGOR MAKES THIS CASE EVEN MORE NEWSWORTHY. IF YOU HAD A BOOK THAT MAKES A MEDIA STAR OUT OF A MURDERING BAG OF SHANK, IT’S A WONDER HE DOESN’T HAVE EVERY ASPIRING DAHMER OR BUNDY QUEUING UP ON HIS DOOR STEP. HOW LONG SINCE THIS CAME IN? OH, SIX HOURS. WHAT ARE YOU, A CHAPERONE? YES SIR. - DID THAT PHONE RING? - NO. INSPECTOR BALANTINE SAID YOU MIGHT MISS A TRANSMISSION. AH, GOOD THINKING, BECAUSE I’M GOING OUT. STAY OUT OF MY STUFF. OKAY, WE’VE GOT A MATCH FROM MISSING PERSONS: FATHER HENRY, SISTERS HEATHER AND MARY. AND HER NAME IS SHARON LIGGET, LAST SEEN THREE DAYS AGO. SHE’S IN OUTSIDE SALES, LIVES ALONE, SO NOBODY CALLED IT IN SOONER. HEY. HEY, YOU HAVE ANY LIGHT BEER? LIGHT BEER? SOUNDS REFRESHING. YES. I’LL, AH, PAY FOR HIS AS WELL, IF THAT’S OKAY. HE HASN’T PAID FOR A WEEK. THAT’S FINE. OH, PUT YOUR MONEY AWAY, BOY, AND THAT’S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. WHAT’S YOUR NAME? I’M DAVID CONY, YOU KNOW, HARD COVER REPORTER , THE TELEVISION SHOW. YOU’RE TRYING TO IMPRESS ME, OR PISS ME OFF? OH, MAYBE £50,000 WOULD, HUH? ALL WE WANT IS AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH YOURSELF ABOUT THE WHOLE THING. GET OUT OF MY FACE, PAL. LOOK, THINK ABOUT IT. IT’S A GREAT STORY. YOU KNOW, ABOUT AN OLD COP, LEAVES HIS FAMILY, LEAVES HIS JOB, RUNS AWAY TO GLASGOW. HEY? WELL, COME ON, TALK TO ME! I MEAN, AFTER ALL WE’RE ALL IN THE SAME GAME, ANYWAY, AREN’T WE? WELL, YOU THINK THIS IS A GAME? YOU FUCKING TABLOID MAGGOTS FEED ON PEOPLE’S MISERY. I SHIT ON ALL YOU PARASITES. OH, GOD. YOU’RE THAT DRUNK. SURPRISE. I’M OUTTA HERE, MADDIE. THE PLACE IS STARTING TO REEK. MACGREGOR, COME HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU’RE SO-- HEY. YOU WANT ME TO PHONE YOU A TAXI? PUT IT ON MY TAB. (police siren) OH, SHIT! Female officer: IT’S DIFFERENT FROM THE INSIDE, ISN’T IT MACGREGOR? DAVID CONY HAS STITCHES IN HIS LIP. I’M NOT SURE THERE’LL BE ANY CHARGES YET. YOUR, UH, FORMER CAPTAIN AT SAN FRANCISCO WAS KIND ENOUGH TO FAX US OVER SOME OF YOUR OLD FILES. BALANTINE’S LOOKING THROUGH THEM TO SEE IF THERE’S ANYBODY THERE THAT MATCHES THIS GUY’S PROFILE. ONE OF YOUR FANS, MAYBE? IT’S A WASTE OF TIME. IT’S A POSSIBILITY WE HAVE TO EXPLORE. WELL, IF YOU SAY SO. WELL, YOU DON’T AGREE? YOU DON’T THINK I’VE ALREADY THOUGHT THROUGH THAT? LOOK, UH, WE JUST GOT ANOTHER ONE, THIS MORNING. I WANT YOU TO WORK WITH US, WE NEED AN ADVISOR. I CAN’T, I CAN’T DO THAT. I THINK YOU CAN, JAMES. COME ON, UPSTAIRS FIRST. THERE’S NO EVIDENCE OF ANY SEXUAL MOLESTATION AT ALL ON EITHER GIRL. NO SEMEN, NO HAIR FOLLICLES, NO PRINTS, LATENT OR OTHERWISE. THE KILLER WORE GLOVES AND WIPED THE BODY CLEAN. WHY IS THAT? - OH, HE WAS A NEAT LITTLE LAD. - A TISSUE BEHIND THE NOSE AND MOUTH SHOW EACH GIRL WAS SUBDUED BY A WAD OF COTTON SOAKED IN ETHER. THE MEANS OF KILLING IS SURPRISINGLY CLEAN, THERE’S NO MUTILATION AT ALL. THE ACTUAL CAUSE OF DEATH IS PULMONARY EMBOLISM INDUCED BY AN INJECTION OF POTASSIUM, BY WAY OF HYPODERMIC NEEDLE. THE EMBALMING PROCESS CAME POSTMORTEM. LET’S LOOK. YEP, SHE’S DEAD ALRIGHT. WE CAN DO FIRST NAME SEARCHES IN COMBINATION THROUGH MOTOR VEHICLE AND CREDIT BUREAUS. BUT, IF THE GUY’S SENDING THE FAX ON A BOOT MOBILE, HE’S OBVIOUSLY NO SLOUCH ON COMPUTERS. HE PROBABLY GETS ON-LINE AND RUNS A LIST BEFOREHAND TO MAKE SURE THERE’S NO CONNECTION. I’LL RUN IT ALL, OF COURSE. BUT, WE SURE COULD USE ANOTHER VARIABLE TO LIMIT THE SEARCH. MR. MACGREGOR, THEODORE SYMES. I’M NOT BOTHERING YOU? James: NO BOTHER AT ALL. CAN I OFFER YOU SOMETHING? A DRINK PERHAPS? I EXPECTED YOU’D ASK THAT. I UNDERSTAND MY DAUGHTER WAS ROTTING IN YOUR GARDEN WHILE YOU WERE BOOZING IT UP IN HERE. MR. SYMES, I AM TRULY SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. BUT THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD HAVE DONE TO SAVE HER. OH, WELL THAT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU TALK TO. I HAVE GOOD FRIENDS DOWNTOWN, YOU COULD HAVE REPORTED THAT OBITUARY WHEN YOU GOT IT. SOMEONE THERE MAY HAVE RECOGNIZED WHO THE TARGET WAS. THE POLICE COULD HAVE SAVED MY DAUGHTER. I SEE FROM THE LOOK OF THIS PLACE, YOU DON’T HAVE ANY CHILDREN. I GUESS IT’S NOT MY BUSINESS TO PRY. BUT IF YOU HAD A CHILD AND LOST THAT CHILD, THEN YOU WOULD DO ANYTHING, ANY GODDAMNED THING TO MAKE SURE THAT ANIMAL NEVER TAKES ANOTHER BREATH. WORK WITH THE POLICE AND MR. WALLACE. FIND THIS MONSTER, DON’T LET ANOTHER FATHER GO THROUGH THIS. (fax machine ringing) (screaming) Clerk: IS THAT IT? DO YOU WANT THE PAPER? YEAH, AND... A BOTTLE OF GLENFIDDICH. REALLY SICK BUGGERY, SOMEONE SHOULD CATCH HIM. SOMEBODY SHOULD. IT’S JUST LIKE SYMES AND LIGGET, WE’VE TRACED BACK THE LAST FEW DAYS OF KATE JURGEN’S LIFE, HOUR BY HOUR, MINUTE BY MINUTE. THERE’S NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY, NO THREATS, NOTHING SUSPICIOUS, NO LINKS, EXCEPT FOR MACGREGOR. THAT’S THE COMMON THREAD BETWEEN THE VICTIMS, OTHER THAN THEY’RE ALL MIDDLE CLASS. OR HE SEES A GIRL HE LIKES ON THE STREET, STALKS HER, NABS HER, THEN KILLS HER, AND DUMPS HER. HOW DOES HE FIND THEM? I KNOW IT LOOKS RANDOM, GWENNIE. BUT IT DOESN’T HALF FEEL RIGHT. SO, ISN’T MACGREGOR THE KEY? Captain: ANY WORD FROM SCOTLAND YARD? THE YARD’S HAVEN’T COME UP WITH ANYTHING YET. BUT THEY SHOULD BE ARRIVING HERE ANYTIME NOW. I’VE CONTACTED THE FBI AND THE CIA FOR ASSISTANCE. THERE REVIEWING EVERYTHING WE HAVE. MAYBE THE KEY IS IN HIS MODE OF EXECUTION? HE ISN’T BRUTAL... WELL HE IS A FUCKING BRUTAL. BUT, HE’S MORE COLD THAN VICIOUS. IT’S LIKE HE DOESN’T WANT TO HURT OR ABUSE THEM. WHY DOES HE CHOOSE TO DO IT THAT WAY? IT’S NOT A CHOICE, IT’S A NEED. - YOU CAN’T BE SERIOUS. - DANNY, HE’S ALREADY INVOLVED. - HE’S A DRUNK. - IF HE CAN HELP... - HE’S A FUCKING PISS ARTIST. - RIGHT NOW, I’LL TRY ANYTHING. WHAT, IS THAT AN ORDER? OR ARE YOU LEAVING IT UP TO MY DISCRETION? Gwen: GOT EVERYTHING. THESE TAPES ARE LABELED BY VICTIM. WINDOWS 95. AND MACGREGOR... MAKE US LOOK STUPID. I PLAN TO. Balantine: HE DESIRES MORE UPSCALE WOMEN, WHO ARE LESS APPROACHABLE. NO RUNAWAYS, NO TOURISTS, NO HOOKERS. HE’S VERY SLICK IN HIS METHODS OF ABDUCTION BECAUSE HE’S SMART. HE’S REAL SMART AND A GOOD PLANNER. HE STALKS RELENTLESSLY. HE KNOWS THEIR SCHEDULES. HE HAS TO OR ELSE HOW COULD HE SEND THE OBIT AHEAD OF TIME. TELL ME SOMETHING I DON’T ALREADY KNOW. HE MEETS THEM BEFOREHAND. HOW THE BLOODY HELL WOULD YOU KNOW THAT? I’M THE EXPERT, I’VE BEEN ON TV. EMPTIED AND CLEAN AS A WHISTLE, MR. MACGREGOR. WELL, THIS ONE’S JUST LIKE THE OTHERS, VIRTUALLY NO FIBERS. ITS LIKE HE VACUUMED THEM OR SOMETHING, KEPT THEIR CLOTHES IN PLASTIC BAGS BEFORE HE DRESSED THEM. I DON’T KNOW, NO, THE ONLY THING I FOUND WAS THIS. WHAT IS THIS? IT’S A PIECE OF SPONGE. I CAN SAY FOR CERTAIN THERE’S BEEN NO PENETRATION PRE- OR POSTMORTEM. AND THESE ARE THE TISSUE BURNS FROM BENEATH HER, CORRECT? YEAH, WE MANAGED TO PULL SOME FIBERS FROM HER NOSTRILS. HE HAD GAUZE SOAKED... WHATEVER, AND HE FORCED IT DOWN TOO HARD OR HE HELD ON TOO LONG. OR HE APPLIED IT OVER AND OVER. HE KEPT HER ALIVE, BUT UNCONSCIOUS, WHICH WOULD ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF THE TIME BETWEEN ABDUCTION AND DEATH. VERY POSSIBLE. I WANT A TISSUE SAMPLE FROM HERE... AND HERE, AND THE LOWER BACK AS WELL. NO PROBLEM. AND THIS, I WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS. SO I SEE THE SIMILARITY IN THE VICTIMS’ BACKGROUNDS AS A MIRROR TO OUR MAN. HE’S WHITE, 20 TO 35 YEARS OLD, WELL EDUCATED, UPPER MIDDLE CLASS, BEYOND THAT, HE’S A LONER, HE’S BEEN VICTIMIZED I THINK IT’S OBVIOUS HE HAS A BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY AND FORENSIC MEDICINE, CORRECT? JUST AS WELL SINCE HE OBVIOUSLY ENJOYS THE COMPANY OF CORPSES. YEAH, THEY DON’T REJECT YOU, AND THEY DON’T TALK BACK. AH, BUT TRY GETTING THEM TO DO THE DISHES. VERY HUMOROUS. NOW, IN THE STATES, AS I’M SURE OVER HERE, THERE’S A PROBLEM WITH, UH... THESE "DATE-RAPE’ DRUGS. GUYS SLIPPING MICKEY’S IN GIRL’S DRINKS. IS THAT WHAT YOU’VE GOT TO DO IN THE STATES TO GET LAID? SO, I’M SURE THERE’S NO SHORTAGE OF WEIRDO’S WHO GET OFF ON SCREWING UNCONSCIOUS WOMEN. AND WHAT IS THE ATTRACTION TO THAT? I MEAN SEX WITH THE BLOODIEST PARTNER? I DON’T KNOW, MACGREGOR. MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL UP YOUR EX-WIFE AND ASK HER. I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU, MACGREGOR, BUT HE’S NOT HAVING SEX WITH THEM. I KNOW THAT. BUT WHATEVER ELSE HE DOES, TO HIM IT’S ONE HELL OF A SUBSTITUTE. EXCUSE ME. Balantine: FAMILY OF KATE JURGEN. (tape fast forwarding) Balantine: ANYONE UH, ANYONE WHO MADE HER FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE, OR... ANYONE WHO’S HARASSING HER? Kate’s mother: DETECTIVE BALANTINE, SHE WAS A NORMAL, HARD WORKING GIRL. SHE HASN’T HAD A BOYFRIEND. HER FATHER PASSED AWAY ALMOST A YEAR AGO NOW. IT’S BEEN A VERY HARD TIME, A VERY HAD YEAR. (tape rewinding) Kate’s mother: HAD A BOYFRIEND. HER FATHER PASSED AWAY ALMOST A YEAR AGO NOW, ITS BEEN A VERY HARD TIME... - MACGREGOR, IF THIS GUY WAS... - NOT NOW, WALLACE. GET ME THEODORE SYMES, WOULD YOU PLEASE? THE DEAR MR. SYMES ON THAT LINE. MR. SYMES, WAS THERE BY ANY CHANCE, UH... I MEAN... A RECENT DEATH IN THE FAMILY PRIOR TO LINDA’S? I SEE. SO THAT WAS YOUR WIFE’S FATHER, CORRECT? I KNOW, SORRY. AND THE OBITUARY, WHAT UH... WHAT PAPER WAS THAT PRINTED IN? THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WE’LL BE IN TOUCH. LINDA SYMES’ MATERNAL GRANDFATHER DIED SEVEN MONTHS AGO OF NATURAL CAUSES. HE WAS WAKED AT MCCORMACK’S FUNERAL HOME. HERE’S A COPY OF HIS DEATH NOTICE FROM THE GLASGOW TIMES. NOW, HERE’S KATE JURGEN’S MOTHER. Kate’s mother: HAD A BOYFRIEND. HER FATHER PASSED AWAY ALMOST A YEAR AGO NOW. IT’S BEEN A VERY HAD TIME, A VERY HAD YEAR. SHARON LIGGET’S GRANDMOTHER DIED LAST MARCH. HERE ARE THE COPIES OF THEIR DEATH NOTICES FROM YOUR LOCAL PAPERS. A LEDGER IN THE DAILY POST. THE OBITS SENT TO ME READ ALMOST IDENTICAL TO ALL OF THESE. THE MISSING LINK, PEOPLE, IS WHERE HE MEETS THEM. FUNERAL PARLORS. EXACTLY. OH, NANA, I’M GOING TO MISS YOU. EXCUSE ME. I WONDER IF YOU COULD HELP ME. UHM, DOROTHY SUNBELL, SHE’S WHICH ONE? IN THE FRONT ROW, OVER THERE. SO, IT’S A WAKE FOR DEE BARBARA? - YES. - AND THIS IS THEIR DAUGHTER? WELL, NO. SHE, BEVERLY AND JEAN, ARE THE DAUGHTERS OF DOROTHY’S OTHER SON, MARTIN. MARTIN AND ELIZABETH’S DAUGHTER. THANK YOU, I GET SO CONFUSED SOMETIMES. - IT IS CONFUSING. - THANK YOU. UHM, HI. DOROTHY, BEVERLY. I’M SORRY. I... I DON’T REMEMBER. I USED TO WORK AT MACINTOSH TEXTILES. I WAS SO SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT DOROTHY. I’M SORRY. THANKS, THANKS FOR COMING. I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE COMPUTER AGE. Gwen: DEATH NOTICES ARE PAID ADVERTISING LIKE CLASSIFIEDS. THEY’RE NOT KEPT ON FILE. SO, WE HAVE TO GET HARD COPIES FROM EVERY LOCAL NEWSPAPER IN THE AREA. AND HAND FEED THEM INTO THE SCANNERS - TO CREATE THE NEW DATABASE. - YOU’RE GIVING ME A HEADACHE. - WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT IN A DAY. - BUT BOTTOM LINE, WILL IT WORK? WELL, IT SHOULD. BUT EVEN THE BEST SCANNERS AREN’T A 100% ACCURATE. A JOHN COULD COME OUT JOAN. - AND JOHN’S DAUGHTER WILL BE DEAD. - PRECISELY. Maddie: NECROPHILIA? WASN’T HE A GREEK GOD OR SOMETHING? THAT’S A JOKE, RIGHT? I CAN’T EVEN DRINK WHEN I READ THIS SHIT. (phone ringing) - BALANTINE? - Gordy: AHH, GOT YOU. HEY, GORDY. SOUNDS LIKE BIG THINGS HAPPENING OVER THERE, JIMMY. LISTEN, I GOT DEXTER PIERCE WAITING. I’M GONNA PUT HIM THROUGH ON A CONFERENCE CALL. NO, NO, NO. DON’T, DON’T GORDY, PLEASE. Dexter: HELLO, MR. MACGREGOR. I HEARD SOME WILD STUFF COMING OUT OF GLASGOW, IT’S ALL OVER CNN. Gordy: WHAT A STROKE, JIMMY. SOME FREAK LAYING OUT YOUR NEXT BOOK? HEY GUYS, I CAN’T TALK RIGHT NOW, I’M DRIVING AND I... JIMMY, JIMMY! I’M HEADING INTO A TUNNEL, AND I’LL LOSE YOU. GORDY, HELLO? HELLO? EX-WIFE? WORSE, AGENT. WELL, I’M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THIS. WHAT’S THIS LOOK LIKE TO YOU? A FUNERAL PARLOR. WRONG, WHOREHOUSE, RIGHT ON THE MANOR. OH, NO WONDER YOU LEFT AMERICA. THIS PLACE GIVES ME THE CREEPS. YOU AND ME BOTH, THIS MUST BE IT. YOU OPEN THAT? - WHY DON’T YOU OPEN IT? - YOU BLOODY OPEN IT. McCormack: MAY I HELP YOU? DETECTIVE INSPECTOR BALANTINE. THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE, MR. MACGREGOR. - MR. MCCORMACK? - YES, THIS WAY, GENTLEMEN. AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE A SMALL DISPLAY FROM OUR VAST RANGE OF FUNERAL ACCESSORIES. A WEE BIT PREMATURE FOR ME. HOW CAN I HELP YOU, GENTLEMEN? YEAH, WE’RE INVESTIGATING THE MURDER OF A LINDA SYMES. YOU HANDLED HER FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS, IS THAT CORRECT? YES, THE SYMES’ FAMILY HAS USED OUR SERVICES FOR GENERATIONS. SO, YOU HANDLED THE GRANDFATHER TOO? YES, YES, THAT’S RIGHT. COULD YOU FURNISH ME WITH THE NAMES AND EMPLOYMENT FILES OF ALL THE MEN WHO WERE WORKING HERE AT THE TIME OF... THE GRANDFATHER’S FUNERAL, THAT WAS ON NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR. WE’RE CHECKING THE RECORDS OF ALL THE FUNERAL PARLORS AND MORTUARY EMPLOYEES. HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR, ANY MEMBER OF YOUR STAFF, YOU’VE NOTICED? NO. NO, NO, CAN’T SAY I HAVE. ANYBODY YOU LET GO, ANYBODY QUIT IN THE PAST YEAR? YEAR AND A HALF? NO, WE HAVE A SMALL STAFF, THERE’VE BEEN NO CHANGES. ANYONE STRANGE HANGING AROUND THE SERVICES, PARTICULARLY MR. SYMES’S? WELL UH... SO MANY PEOPLE COME HERE. AND I KNOW VERY FEW OF THEM FOR THE MOST PART. WELL THERE, YOU’VE BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE MISTER, UH... MCCORMACK. PERHAPS WE COULD LOOK AT THOSE EMPLOYMENT FILES NOW? YES, OF COURSE. OKAY. I CAN’T BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW DISTURBING ALL OF THIS IS TO ME. YOU GET ANYTHING? SORT OF. Balantine: THERE’S TOO MANY DEAD PEOPLE OUT THERE. I’VE FOUND 9,000 OBITUARIES SO FAR. HOW ARE YOU DOING? OH, BAD, WE’VE HAD A LOT OF GLITCHES. LET’S PRAY THIS FREAK TAKES ONE MORE NIGHT OFF. OH, THE FBI PROFILE CAME IN. FBI. WELL, WHAT A LOAD OF BOLLOCKS. I BET THERE’S NOTHING WE CAN USE. NOTHING THAT MACGREGOR DIDN’T ALREADY TELL US. (phone ringing) THERE IT IS. THE PARENTS: THOMAS, MARY. SISTERS: KAREN, NANCY. WE’RE LOOKING FOR ONE DEATH NOTICE WITH SOME OR ALL OF THOSE NAMES. LET’S TRY COMPUTER AND MANUAL SEARCH. THOMAS AND MARY, THAT’S JUST GREAT. WE GOT ABOUT A 100 EXTRA HITS. THIS WILL TAKE LIKE TWO FUCKING DAYS. I HATE THIS. FUCKING HELL! FUCKIN’ LEAVE THAT! JUST FUCKIN’ LEAVE IT! HEY, CAPTAIN, HEY, WE’VE FOUND NOTHING BUT... IT’S GOT IT! KATHERINE HILLIARD, SURVIVED BY HER DAUGHTERS AND BY HER SON, THOMAS, HIS WIFE MARY, AND SEVEN GRANDCHILDREN. HILLIARD! Gwen: I CAN FIND THOMAS HILLIARD, 424 LAKE AVENUE. NO DRIVER’S LICENSE ON MARY HILLIARD. BUT HERE’S A GAIL HILLIARD AT THE SAME ADDRESS. IT’S TOO LATE, PEOPLE. HOW’D THAT FUCK DO IT? (phone ringing) Gail’s father: YES? YES, I HAVE A DAUGHTER, GAIL. SHE DOESN’T LIVE HERE ANYMORE. Mother: TOM, WHO IS IT? Father: THE POLICE! THEY WANT GAIL’S ADDRESS. Mother: WHY? WHAT’S WRONG? AH, NO. HER PHONE’S BEEN OUT. DETECTIVE INSPECTOR BALANTINE. DON’T BE ALARMED, I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS, GAIL. GAIL? NO, GAIL’S MY FLATMATE. IS SHE HERE? NO, SHE... SHE DIDN’T COME HOME LAST NIGHT. LOOK, IS SOMETHING WRONG? WHERE’S MACGREGOR? I THINK HE SHOULD BE AROUND ANYTIME NOW. FEELIN’ JAKE? HEY, WHAT’S UP, MACGREGOR? I CANT DO IT. AYE, RIGHT, WELL. IF THAT’S THE WAY YOU FEEL. I CAN’T BEAR SEEING THEIR FACES ANYMORE. WHICH IS WORSE? FINDING THE VICTIMS OR FACING THE ONES THEY LEFT BEHIND? I KICKED DOWN ALBERT SMITH’S BASEMENT DOOR THREE YEARS AGO. I STILL CAN’T LOOK AT MY DAUGHTER THE SAME WAY. SO, YOU QUIT, ABANDONED YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR FAMILY... FUCK ’EM. YOU’RE A BIT OF A PRICK, MACGREGOR, YOU KNOW. BUT, YOUR BLOODY GOOD AT THIS AND THAT’S ALL THAT MATTERS TO YOU AND I. I QUIT MYSELF A FEW YEARS BACK, BUT I DID NOT FEEL ANY BETTER. AS A MATTER OF FACT I FELT A BLOODY SIGHT WORSE. I FINALLY DECIDED THAT MEN LIKE YOU AND ME, WE’RE NOT SUPPOSED TO FEEL GOOD, THAT’S NOT THE WORLD WE LIVE IN. FOR SOME FUCKED UP REASON GOD PUT US ON THIS EARTH TO DO THE DIRTY JOBS. I NEED YOUR HELP ON THIS ONE, JIMMY. SEE IT THROUGH WITH ME, WILL YOU? Leo: HMM, I BROUGHT SOMETHING FOR YOU. YOUR TISSUE SAMPLES. LOOK AT THE LAB REPORT ON THE LAST PAGE. FOUND A PIECE OF SURGICAL SPONGE WITH SOME CHEMICAL TRACE, A DETERGENT MAYBE. Wallace: AT LEAST HE WASHED THEM. AND DO THEIR HAIR AND MAKE THEM UP. REAL MORTICIAN. THESE TISSUE SAMPLES. THERE’S SWEAT, HIS SWEAT. HER BODY... HE HOLDS THEM. James: HE’S ALONE WITH HER, SOMEWHERE, PREPARING THE POOR GIRL TO FULFILL HIS SICK FANTASY. HE LIVES IN SOME SECRET HELL-HOLE, HIS DEMENTED PLACE, THAT’S WHERE HE TAKES THEM. SOMEWHERE LARGE ENOUGH FOR HIM TO HIDE THEIR CARS. HE LAYS WITH THEM, WITH HIS ARM HOOKED AROUND HER AND HIS HEAD AGAINST HER BREAST. JUST AS YOU AND I WOULD DO WITH A LIVING, BREATHING GIRL. SOON, HE NEEDS ANOTHER. SPARE ME THE WHISPERING, CROWDED ROOMS. THEIR FRIENDS WHO COME, GAPE AND GO. THE CEREMONIOUS AIR OF GLOOM, ALL WHICH MAKES DEATH A HIDEOUS SHOW. THEIR PARENTS: GORDON, CYNTHIA; SIBLINGS: MARGARET, ARTHUR. YOU’RE JUST GONNA PICK HER UP AND THAT’S IT? I KNOW YOU ALL WANNA SAVE THIS GIRL’S LIFE AND SO DO I. THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO CATCH HIM. I’M NOT USING THIS LASSIE AS A PIECE OF CHEESE. HE DOESN’T KNOW WE HAVE THE WINDOW OPEN. AS SOON AS HE DOES, IT’S CLOSED. THIS IS FROM AN OBIT IN APRIL, APRIL 4th, LAST NAME OF DECEASED: MILLER. VANESSA MILLER. THIS ONE’S EASY. "DEVOTED MOTHER OF GORDON, LOVING GRANDMOTHER OF MARGARET, ARTHUR AND CHERYL." RUNNING THE I.D. ON CHERYL MILLER. SIX CHERYL MILLERS IN THE GREATER GLASGOW AREA. DATE OF BIRTH, 1953. SHE’S 45. 1948. 62. DATE OF BIRTH, 1978. THAT’S HER. THE PARENTS? GORDON AND CYNTHIA. CYNTHIA’S AT SAME ADDRESS, LOOKS LIKE SHE LIVES WITH HER MOTHER. YOU’RE A FRIEND OF HERS, BE CAREFUL NOT TO CAUSE A PANIC, YOU JUST FIND OUT WHERE SHE IS. GOT IT. HELLO, MRS. MILLER? IS CHERYL THERE? OH, I REALLY NEED TO SPEAK WITH HER NOW. I’M SUPPOSED TO FILL IN FOR SOMEONE TOMORROW NIGHT, AND I’M GOING TO BE LATE. DO YOU HAVE THE NUMBER RIGHT THERE? BECAUSE I LEFT MY BAG IN THE CAR. I’M IN A PHONE BOX. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MRS. MILLER. (phone rings) I’LL GET IT. KILTS, MAY I HELP YOU? HELLO, I NEED TO MEET YOU AND TALK? COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE EXACTLY YOU ARE? SO, THAT’S THE KILT SHOP AT CENTRAL STATION? I’M AFRAID, YOU KNOW... WOULD IT BE OKAY IF I GO OVER RIGHT NOW? UH, HUH. AND, UH, YOUR NAME IS? CHERYL. CHERYL MILLER. YES, I’LL BE HERE TILL 7:30. THAT’S GREAT. WELL, I’LL JUST STROLL OVER RIGHT AWAY, OKAY? THANKS A LOT. YOU’VE GOT A DATE TONIGHT, HAVEN’T YOU? YES, WITH JOHNNY OCTOPUS. - HMM? - MR. HANDS. - WELL, OFF YOU GO. - ARE YOU SURE? - UH, HUH, WE’RE PRETTY QUIET. - AH, WELL, THANKS VERY MUCH. - ENJOY YOURSELF. - I’LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. OH, DON’T DO ANYTHING I WOULDN’T DO. WHERE’S CHERYL MILLER? SENT HER HOME EARLY. SHE LEFT A FEW MINUTES AGO. HER CAR’S RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD. - YOU CAN’T JUST RUSH IN HERE. - WHERE DID SHE GO? SHE WENT DOWN THE ROAD, BUT... YOU’D BE QUICKER OUT THE BACK. CHERYL, COME ON. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING IN MY CAR. (screaming) DETECTIVE INSPECTOR BALANTINE. WERE YOU HARMED? WERE YOU HARMED IN ANY WAY, CHERYL? BACK OFF! FUCKIN’ SCUM! WHERE DID YOU PARK THE CAR? YOU’RE OKAY NOW, YOU’RE WITH ME. DON’T WORRY, WE’LL GET YOU TO THE STATION IN A FEW MINUTES. YOUR FRIEND? HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN HIM? I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH HIM. I’VE KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS, YOU WENT TO SCHOOL WITH HIM? WE’VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR YEARS. WHAT HAS HE DONE? ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT. NO, HE’S A KILLER! HE’S A KILLER! ALRIGHT. ALRIGHT. ALRIGHT, COME ON. THIS JUST CAME THROUGH. TURNER... HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO GET A LIST OF EVERY GIRL REPORTED MISSING IN THE LAST TWO YEARS? DANNY ASKED FOR THEM YESTERDAY. THIS IS IT? HE TOLD ME TO ELIMINATE EVERY GIRL THAT WASN’T FROM A MIDDLE OR UPPER MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY. - AND THE HOOKERS, THE HOMELESS. - STAYING WITHIN THE PROFILE. RIGHT, AND THESE THREE HIT THE MARK. YOU KNOW THERE’S DEFINITELY SOMETHING HERE. I CHECKED BACK TWO MORE YEARS, AND FOUND ONLY ONE, DAUGHTER OF SOME CEO. BUT SHE WAS A BORDERLINE JUNKIE WITH A TRUST FUND, WHO WAS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN. THE POINT IS, THIS PATTERN STARTS ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO. PRETTY, UPPER MIDDLE CLASS GIRLS START TO DISAPPEAR. SO IT STARTED TWO YEARS AGO. THIS IS THE FIRST ONE. IT’S THE FIRST GIRL. THESE BASTARDS USUALLY START CLOSE TO HOME. AND THE FIRST ONE WOULD BE THIS ONE. MARY DOWNEY. James: MARY DOWNEY. MR. DOWNEY? YES, THIS IS INSPECTOR TURNER. I’M SORRY TO SAY WE DON’T HAVE ANY GOOD NEWS FOR YOU SIR, BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION. PRIOR TO YOUR DAUGHTER’S DISAPPEARANCE, DID SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY PASS AWAY? I KNOW IT’S A STRANGE QUESTION, SIR, BUT IT’S IMPORTANT. NO, NONE OF YOUR OTHER CHILDREN, PERHAPS ONE OF THE GRANDPARENTS? YES, AND WHERE WAS THE WAKE? AND THAT WAS TWO MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DISAPPEARANCE? THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. DOWNEY. TWO MONTHS PRIOR, NOVEMBER 13th, STATLER’S FUNERAL HOME. Wallace: WALLACE HERE. GIVE ME THE DATA ON STATLER’S FUNERAL HOME, FAST. UH, HUH, AYE. WHEN? CHANGED HANDS IN ’83, WENT OUT OF BUSINESS IN ’85. - THAT MEANS HE’S ON HIS OWN, THEN? - HERE’S THE OLD ADDRESS. CHEERS. I’M HEADING OVER THERE. GIVE ME ANYTHING YOU CAN ON STATLER INCLUDING EVERYONE WHO EVER WORKED FOR THEM. MR. MACGREGOR? GOT A MINUTE? I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH THE CHIEF CONSTABLE AND THE PROCURATOR FISCAL. YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE, THEY’RE ON THEIR WAY DOWN. LOOK, I’M UNDER FIRE. THIS IS A WHOLE NEW GAME. WE’RE NOW DEALING WITH A SERIAL KILLER WHO’S KILLED A COP. IF THEY FIND OUT I’VE GOT YOU INVOLVED, I’LL BE WORKING SECURITY AT FOOTBALL MATCHES. - WE GOT NEW INFORMATION HERE. - WE’RE GONNA TAKE A FRESH TACTIC, ALRIGHT? WE GOT A DECENT SKETCH OF THE GUY. WE’RE GONNA BLANKET THE CITY. OFF-DUTY OFFICERS HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO HELP WITH THE SEARCH. I’M PUTTING EVERY AVAILABLE MAN TO THE STREETS. - WE’VE GOT A LEAD, A PRETTY GOOD ONE. - YEAH, WE’LL FOLLOW UP. BUT YOU’RE OUT, I’M SORRY. I’LL BE IN TOUCH. (camera clicking) UH, CHIEF... YOU NEED TO FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE, PAL. OUR PLACE HAS BEEN CLOSED FOR SIX MONTHS. GUY SOLD OUT FOR A NEW SHOPPING MALL. I USED TO WORK THERE, SO I DID. FOR A SPELL, ANYWAY. YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN THE STATLER’S THEN? AS MUCH AS ANYONE DID AROUND HERE. KNOW WHERE THEY ARE NOW? NAH, THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS. THE OLD MAN SOLD THE PLACE TO... MR. DOUGLAS, AND HE SOLD IT TO A DEVELOPER. AH, IT’S A HELL OF A THING THEY SOLD, BETWEEN YOU AND ME. ANY IDEA WHERE I CAN FIND THEM? AYE, THEY’VE GOT A LOCATION AT POLLACK AND SHIELDS AT THE COMER OF ST. ANDREWS AND CESSNA. WHO’S THEY? MR. STATLER, THAT’S GEORGE SENIOR, ALRIGHT, AND THEN THERE’S GEORGE JUNIOR, THAT’S THE SON. AND, THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER, I CAN’T REMEMBER HER NAME... AND HOW OLD IS GEORGE JUNIOR? GOTTA BE... 30-ISH, I SUPPOSE. REMEMBER WHAT KIND OF GUY HE WAS? YOU KNOW WHAT? VERY STRANGE. KEEP IT. AH, CHEERS, YOU’RE A SOLDIER. LIKEWISE. COME WITH ME. I CAN’T NOW. - YOU REALLY WANT IT? - YES, I DO. - BUT LOOK... - OH... I KNOW, LOOK, I’D BETTER GO. COME HERE. LISTEN, MY LAB’S OVER AT ABOUT 7:30. - I’LL BE BY RIGHT AFTER THAT, OKAY? - GOOD. COME HERE. - I GOTTA GO, I GOTTA GO. - DON’T YOU WANT TO GET UP NOW? COME HERE. I LOVE YOU. (screaming) IT’S ALRIGHT, IT’S OKAY. SEE? IT’S ALRIGHT. YES? MR. STATLER? I HAVEN’T SEEN MY SON IN OVER TWO YEARS, DETECTIVE. SOUNDS LIKE QUITE A FALLING OUT, MR. STATLER. YES. WHEN I CHOSE TO RETIRE THREE YEARS AGO, IT WAS EVIDENT THAT I HAD TO CLOSE THE BUSINESS. WHY’S THAT? MY SON... HE NEVER HAD IT, IF YOU KNOW AT I MEAN. NO, I’M AFRAID I DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. WELL, LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY. GEORGIE WAS ALWAYS A SOLITARY SOUL, WITHDRAWN, ESPECIALLY AFTER HIS MOTHER DIED, HE WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD. A GOOD WORKER, INVOLVED, INTERESTED IN THE CRAFT, BUT... GEORGIE WASN’T GOOD WITH PEOPLE, EVER. AND YOU CAN’T THINK OF ANYWHERE I COULD FIND HIM? NO, I’M SORRY. ANY PLACE HE VISITS, ANY IDEAS, NOTHING? GEORGIE WAS ANGRY WITH ME FOR NOT TURNING THE BUSINESS OVER TO HIM. I MADE DAMNED SURE HE WAS WELL LOOKED AFTER FINANCIALLY, BUT THAT DIDN’T SEEM TO MATTER. WOULD HE BE WITH HIS SISTER BY ANY CHANCE? NO. WHERE IS YOUR DAUGHTER, MR. STATLER? SHE’S... INSTITUTIONALIZED. WHERE? IN DUNBARTON, SANTINO’S SANITARIUM. BUT I’M SURE HE WOULDN’T GO THERE FOR ANY REASON. ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR SON’S BEHAVIOR THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER... ABNORMAL? CHRIST SAID LET THE DEAD BURY THE DEAD. BUT, UNFORTUNATELY THAT’S NOT HOW IT WORKS. PEOPLE ARE, BY THEIR VERY NATURE, CURIOUS, PERHAPS EVEN SUSPICIOUS OF, THOSE OF US IN MY PROFESSION, MR. MACGREGOR. BUT ISN’T IT AN INTERESTING PARADOX THAT AT THE TIME OF DEATH, THEIR CURIOSITY IS LAID ASIDE. AND I BECOME A PILLAR OF THE COMMUNITY. I WASN’T ASKING ABOUT YOU, MR. STATLER. I WAS ASKING ABOUT YOUR SON. NOTHING ABNORMAL, NO, SIR. OLIVIA? I’D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT GEORGE. I NEED TO FIND HIM. (kids laughing) WHO ARE YOU? YOU’LL SOON UNDERSTAND. OLIVIA LIVED WITH HER GRANDMOTHER UNTIL SHE PASSED AWAY TWO YEARS AGO. SHE’S BEEN HERE EVER SINCE. WELL, WHAT ABOUT HER FATHER? APPARENTLY HE WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH HER, HE NEVER VISITS. HER BROTHER GEORGE, EVER BEEN BY? NO, I DON’T THINK SO. NO ONE’S EVER BEEN TO SEE HER AS FAR AS I KNOW. SAD. IT’S VERY COMMON. PEOPLE WANT TO CUT THEMSELVES OFF FROM THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF LIFE. AT LEAST YOU’RE HERE. WELL, SOMEONE HAS TO BE. (phone ringing) WHAT... WHAT’S GOING ON? SLEEP AND DEATH, TWO TWINS OF WINGED RACE, OF MATCHLESS SWIFTNESS, BUT OF SILENT PACE. WHERE AM I? SLEEP IS A DEATH. OH, MAYBE TRY BY SLEEPING WHAT IT IS TO DIE. AND AS GENTLY, LAY MY HEAD ON MY GRAVE, AS NOW MY BED. FOR IN THAT SLEEP OF DEATH, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME. SLEEP AFTER TOIL, PORT, AFTER STORMY SEAS. Woman: WHAT’S GOING ON? - George: SHHH. - NO. PLEASE! IS THAT YOU, MR. MACGREGOR? DON’T DO IT, GEORGE. PLEASE DON’T. George: ANOTHER FAILED RESCUE, MR. MACGREGOR? JUST LIKE THE LITTLE BOY IN YOUR LAST CASE. HOW HAUNTING THAT MUST BE. SHE’S SO BEAUTIFUL, ISN’T SHE? SOON, SHE’LL BE PERFECT. YOU KNOW, I’M GLAD YOU’RE HERE. FINALLY, SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS DEATH IS SUCH A GRAND PART OF BOTH OUR LIVES. HOW IS THAT, GEORGIE? GEORGIE? SOMEONE’S BEEN SPEAKING TO MY FATHER. HE WOULD HAVE LIKED HER. SUCH A FINE CORPSE FOR PRESENTING. George: HE WILL DIE. THE PROFESSIONAL. DID HE TELL YOU HE WAS THE PILLAR OF THE COMMUNITY? SO HE SAID. HE ALSO USED TO SAY, "LET THE DEAD BURY THE DEAD". BUT HE DIDN’T UNDERSTAND. IT WASN’T A BUSINESS TO ME! HE TOOK AWAY MY LIFE. SO LET THE DEAD BURY THE DEAD, SHALL WE? NO ONE HAS TO DIE. HELP! HELP ME! HELP!
