Nana and Pop Pop, you really did it in style. Ah. I have had all the honeycomb lattes and, like, eight guava pastries. Oh, so it's my fault when you won't fit into your skinny jeans. You know I can't be left alone at the bakery. - Where have you been? - I was making some adjustments to my wedding mood board. I found the most perfect twinkling lights. Your imaginary wedding will be so well-illuminated. But it's almost my birthday. My 35th birthday. The day that my fortune predicted I would have the most perfect wedding to the most perfect man. Oh, you're still holding on to that? Why wouldn't I? Well, I mean, you know... You're single. But this fortune was done by Madam Lotus, the Seer of Seine. She's the most famous fortune teller in France. People travel from all over the world to see her. I love your conviction, but your birthday is in, like, three months. Every other prediction she made has come true. She said I would have a creative job. I'm a children's book illustrator. Well, yeah, but you could be like a nail technician or a hairdresser. Those are both creative. She said I would live surrounded by magic. I live in Magic City. Okay, but, like, if you moved to Las Vegas, you would be around magic. It just, you know... She said I would befriend my hero. Beyoncé liked one of your tweets and that was a year ago, that is not a friendship. This is a friendship, that's not a friendship. What's it like living in your dark, cynical world? All right, you know, I love you and I love this for you. I just... I just don't want to see you get disappointed. I won't. I need you on board though because you're my best person. And, honey, I am so honored. In fact, I have so many fun and interesting stories to tell about you at the reception. None about your fiancé because he doesn't exist. Oh, no, he exists, I just haven't met him yet. And when you do, the clouds will part, the world will stop turning, the angels will sing, you'll fall madly in love at first sight, I'm sure of it. I know. As time passes, I just get more and more excited because I know something incredible is about to happen. Yeah. I think you're right. I think something incredible is about to happen. Uh, hold that thought. I'm gonna go make his day and ask him out. Oh. Humble as always. Mm-hm. Hey, how's it going? So, this is so crazy. I work, like, all the time. I was talking this over with my personal assistant over there and it turns out I have a whole weekend off. Isn't that nuts? So when do you want to get together, Friday or Saturday? Just pick one, write your name, write your number. I'm gonna call you. Sweet. See you soon. Nice to meet you. Literally that easy. Literally. Hi, um, I just got an e-mail that you have a cancellation three months from tomorrow. Okay, um, I'd like to book the venue. Yes, for a wedding. Great! What is this? What's going on here? You have to tell me, I don't know. Okay, you know the Spanish monastery? Uh, the Spanish monastery? It's like a super old building, brick by brick, five million bajillion years ago? They had a cancellation on my birthday! Oh, wow! I mean, that is incredible if you had a man to marry. Okay, Madam Lotus made one more prediction. She said that my grandparents would be involved in my special day, which was really confusing because they're no longer around anymore, but guess what? They got married at the Spanish monastery! So... I booked it. Okay. Okay, you're secretly dating someone, right? I mean, you got a whole little secret fling on the side, something you're not telling me about. Sit down, spill the tea. I want to know everything about him. No. I am a hundred percent single, but if Madam Lotus predicted that I'm getting married in three months, that means I must be about to meet my fiancé any day now. ♪ I fell in love, fell in love with you ♪ ♪ I'd climb a mountain to get close to you ♪ - Hello? - Hello, it's Carmen from the Spanish monastery. How are the wedding plans coming along? Oh, hi. Um, oh, they're great. I already have the flowers, the caterer, and I am speaking to the print shop tomorrow about the place cards. Oh! Oh my, you are on the ball. Well, I might have had a few things planned. So, I still have yet to meet your lovely husband-to-be. Right, yes. I'm sorry. He's actually away working again. Oh, he's a deep-sea diver, right? Uh, yeah, always going on expeditions. You are so understanding. Some relationships would struggle. Oh, no. He's very passionate about what he does. I just have to support him. Now that's true love. But like I said on the phone, we can't go forward until I've met the both of you. I'm sorry. It's our policy. And if we bend it for one couple... Right. I'm so sorry. As soon as he's back on the surface, I promise you'll be the first to know. Just maybe give me a day or two? Two days, but no longer, I'm afraid. We'll speak soon. Bye-bye. Uh, talk soon! Back on the surface? What am I gonna do? I just don't understand why you said deep-sea diver. I mean, you might as well have told 'em he was an astronaut. When I advertise for my next PA, I'm gonna specify "sense of urgency" in the job description. I was held up by your favorite illustrator. I mean, come on, we have to look after the talent. Hm. My office, now. Have a seat, Jenny. I'll be with you in ten. Oh, uh, see, you did it again. You got me fired. Hey, look after the phones for me, will ya? If it's something important, just patch it through. What? I don't know how to... Yes, it's a small illustrator, but it's the best that I can do right now. I don't know, they want me to meet some new artist, uh, Jenny Newlove. Yeah. Yeah, I've seen her stuff. It's good. She's kind of trying to do art with a capital A. I know. I know. Okay, look, after my last book, I'm kind of out of options. All right, look, I got to go. Okay, I love you. Bye. - Hi. - Hi! I'm here for a meeting with, um, Clara Morgan. Oh, what's your name? Tyler Reeves. Um, hey, could you do me a little favor and not mention anything I said about the artist? Hm, so you're not a fan of Jenny Newlove? No. Her talent is off the charts, but, you know, she thinks she's drawing for the Guggenheim, not for kids. Aren't you the guy that wrote the book about the kid searching for the world's smelliest smells? That's me. Oh, nice. Well, I guess kids do like silly and shallow. No, they like to have fun, and my books make them laugh. I don't know, I think children's fiction should have a deeper meaning, you know, a valuable lesson. Ah, hey, maybe you should write a book with Jenny Newlove. - Tyler. - Clara! - Hi. - Hi. This is Jenny Newlove, the fabulous illustrator I want you to meet. Ha. I thought that was the... Yeah, woman behind desk. Must be a receptionist. Right. This shouldn't take long. - Come on. - Great. Well, thank you both for coming today. - Yeah. - I love both your work. And I really feel this partnership can be wonderful. You'd make a very successful team. Yeah, in that Jenny's beautiful, yet self-indulgent artwork could add a bit of sophistication to my shallow writing? Oh, no, your writing is fine for three-year-olds. Isn't that the point? Sometimes, children actually like to be challenged. Or is that what pretentious adults like to say? You know, there's always a bit of fire in every great creative partnership. Let's try to focus that passion in the right way. Jenny, you're an amazing new artist, but this is a commercial world, and you can't keep waiting for that genius idea to hit you. Your first book was a big hit, but you've plateaued. Your name value could give Jenny exposure, and her fresh outlook can elevate your writing. Hm, that shouldn't be too hard. I think once you read Tyler's new manuscript, you'll be really excited about bringing his words to life. Really? What is it? More of the world's smelliest smells? Oh, so you have read it. - Jenny? - What? Can we speak outside, please? I'll talk to her. She's not always like this. And we need her. What is going on? He's infuriating. I know this is not your ideal job, but I get the feeling there's something else going on here. I think you should tell her about your birthday. Your birthday? You have to arrange a wedding in a month. Well, it's pretty much arranged. But you're single. Isn't it romantic? I am patiently waiting for the one, but I will admit Madam Lotus is cutting it a little bit close. A lot can happen in a month. I know. Remember Rachel Lewis, the copy editor? She met her husband in Vegas. They got married at a love chapel and they're still together. If this were anyone else, I would think they'd lost their mind. But somehow you do have a way of willing things to happen. Yeah, well, I need to meet the one, like, today. I can't lose this venue. You could get married at any time. I know, but when can I have this perfect wedding? I mean, I have been waiting for this for years. I'm just... I'm not ready to give up on it yet. What if you brought a stand-in? Just to the venue meeting, just the first one so you don't lose the booking. But I can't just find any guy off the street. Oh, come on. I could do it. I love you and I know everything about you. Yeah, but you find it impossible to lie. Impossible to lie. Please! I can lie, I can convince. Uh, okay, what do you think of those lilies over there? Those lilies over there? Mm-hm. I love them. They're great. They just, you know, remind me of, um, funeral homes and they smell like death. You want to slate any more of my decor choices? Okay, so that leaves Aiden out. Or... I could be your stand-in. You? Yeah, sure. We'll just take a little crash course in each other's lives on the ride down. I can, uh, wing it. Trust me. I was in an improv group at college. Why would you want to help me? Because you can help me by illustrating my book. That guy is impossible! I can't pretend I'm in love with him. He's a nice guy once you get to know him. And, look, no matter who you take, it's gonna be a little bit of a stretch. Right, but if I agree to take Tyler, then I'm gonna be tied to illustrating his book. Well... If you want that Spanish monastery... You don't have much choice. ♪ Oh, I got to get to you now ♪ I need you somehow ♪ Someway ♪ Oh, you're my blue heaven ♪ I need you right now to make it okay ♪ ♪ Ah-ooh ♪ Hey. I know we just met and all, but let's go book a wedding. You know this is blackmail, right? I'd say that's a bit of an exaggeration. Oh, so if I said no, you would still be here? Look, how about I scratch your back - and then you scratch mine? - Oh. I didn't mean that literally. I mean, you could've at least tried to look presentable. No fiancé of mine would have crumbs on his shirt. You know we're not actually getting married, right? Yes, for that I'm very, very grateful. So, your mother's name is Meredith, and your father's name is Cliff. - Clint! - Clint. Yes. And you are from Seattle. San Diego. My dad was in the Navy, remember? - But what are you doing? - Writing down some notes. Oh, okay, 'cause that won't look suspicious, you bringing out your phone every two seconds. - No. - Ah. Betrothed couples don't socially distance. I mean, we should just call this. They're never gonna buy this. Don't worry so much. Just keep the faith, all right? I got this. I know exactly how to play this. I think you're being a little overconfident. I don't think so. So how was San Dimas growing up? - It was nice. - Was it? Sure you don't want to take my arm? - I'm sure. - Okay. You must be Jenny! Hello! Oh! And you must be her deep-sea diver fiancé. Finally we get to meet! Yes, I've been freediving in Fiji, actually. Oh, he took a last-minute flight. He didn't want to miss this opportunity. You know, I've never been here before, but this is exactly what I had envisioned the moment I asked her. I, um, I took her to the lake, scattered rose petals all over the ground, got down on one knee and asked the most beautiful woman that I've ever met, inside and out, to marry me. How magical. I just love it when a man goes the extra mile. - Thank you. - Please, come this way. I'd love to show you the venue. - Don't overdo it. - Oh, come on. I'm crushing it. The monastery is 900 years old. It was built in the 12th century in northern Spain. It wasn't until 1925 when William Randolph Hearst purchased it and brought it over here. You know, my grandparents were actually married here. Yes. Clint. Senior. - Hell of a guy. - How lovely. And now you will too. Please, right this way. Can't that wait? Uh, Laura wants me to call her. Laura? Oh, that Laura. Um... Do you need five minutes? Um... No. I will call her back. Um, so how did the monastery get over here? Well, when Mr. Hearst purchased the building, it was dismantled stone by stone. It was packed and shipped in over 11,000 crates. It wasn't until 1964 when the building was presented to the bishop of Florida where it's now home to many wedding events. It's going to be a really intimate wedding. I'm just inviting my closest family and friends. Oh, and Tyler's? Oh, uh, yes, of course. But not my Uncle Jimmy though. I know how much you can't stand Uncle Jimmy. We don't really need to go into Uncle Jimmy right now. He's only the man who taught me how to ride the unicycle, but, hey, yeah, we can leave him out. Oh, that's impressive. Yeah, I was in the traveling circus as a child. I can juggle at the same time. Yeah, but the unfortunate incident with the, uh, miniature poodle forced him into a career change. Yes. Don't juggle flaming clubs while riding a unicycle and balancing a miniature poodle on your head is all I can say. Well, I think we can all agree that's a rule for life. Stop being weird. You're the one who brought the poodles into this. Well, thank you so much for waiting for me. We're just thrilled to have our special day here. You are so welcome. It was so lovely getting to meet you two together. So do you think we're a good fit for the monastery? I meet couples all the time and, well, I just think you two have something special. But I was excited to see the ring. - Oh, um... - Oh, um, - we're getting it resized. - Polished. - Resized. - Polished. Polished and resized. We always do that. Well, feel free to let me know if you need any assistance. Just so you know, I will be passing this along to our events manager. I'm not gonna be here on your wedding day. I'll be on my anniversary in Aruba. Did you say Aruba? I have some great scuba... Thank you so much. Um, have a great vacation! Thank you! We'll be in touch. - Yes. - Bye. You're gonna love the marine life. Thanks. Am I dreaming or did we really just pull that off? Well, I can't really say I'm surprised. And she won't even be here on the wedding, so I can easily switch out fiancés. I mean, once I get one, but, you know, one day at a time. Yeah, yeah. Well, looks like I held up my end of the bargain. Now you get to illustrate my book. Better get to drawing. Hey, who knows? Maybe you'll enjoy all this. Now begins Operation FAF. - FAF? - Find a Fiancé. We have T-minus one month and counting for Jenny to find a new man, fall in love, and convince him to marry her. I haven't managed that in my lifetime, but, you know, Jenny might get lucky. The tarot cards predicted it, so it's going to happen. Yeah, we just need to give them a helping hand. All right, what if trying so hard means you meet the wrong man? What if the cards knew that we would be here to help her and this is their way of meeting us halfway? First up, do you have any man in mind or, uh... This is the man I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. I don't want just anyone who will have me. - I see. - Give us a rough idea. Okay, I want a man who's kind, makes me laugh, artistic, musical, knows how to cook, is a good dresser but not obsessed with image, and is fit but doesn't spend every day at the gym. Then we'll look for a unicorn. - Oh. - No, come on. This man is out there and we are going to find him. Now hit me up with dating suggestions. All right, well, everyone meets on apps - these days, don't they? - I don't think I'm gonna meet a husband on an app. I mean, don't you think they just judge you off of a two-second glance at a photo? We're not ruling anything out. I'm gonna add nightclubbing. Is that just because you want me to go clubbing with you? No, I think the clientele at Zinc are very eligible. Okay, maybe for you. Next. Speed dating. Ooh, spot the Gen Xer. All right, it might be old school, but she can meet a lot of men in a short amount of time. Okay, come on, quick-fire. - Aerobics class. - Book club. I've got one. The dog park. But I don't have a dog. Positivity! Okay, where do I start? I don't know if an app is the right place to meet a husband. When you keep swiping left, you're not gonna meet anybody. Okay, but I don't want to marry any of these guys. How would you like it if somebody judged you like that? - Come on. - Okay, this guy is posing with a python. Um, this guy has a tongue piercing. - Mm-hm. - And this guy looks like he just got out of prison. Okay, fair point, but you're not gonna make any progress if you don't do a little bit of action to the right. I'll show you. Oh, wait, I can't even see those guys. It's like ripping off a Band-Aid. Ha, you matched with all of them. Oh, okay, well, what do I do now? Just chat. Uh, okay. Be yourself. "Hi. I just saw your profile. I..." You're not writing a romantic missive here. You just say a time, a place. "Do you want to go on a date with me?" Oh, he's typing. - Got a message. - That's a start. Oh. He just messed up the "you" in "you're" contraction... I mean, your, you're. I can't... I can't do that. The contraction is a deal-breaker? - Uh, well... - Hold the presses! The contraction is a deal-breaker! It's amazing how you stayed single this long. It's so amazing. Okay, can we please just do something else? Like what? You want to just leave it up to fate? Yes. Fate. I would like that. He could be the next guy that walks through that door. Okay, fine. Well, I dare you to ask out the next guy who walks through that door. I will. Okay, well... - Okay. - Now we wait. Oh, he's not bad. Allow me. Hi. - Me? - Yeah. I am so sorry to bother you. - Hello. - Um, my friend, she thinks you're a total sweetheart and she wants to have coffee with you, but she's, like, so shy. Isn't that cute? Ooh. Today, during breakfast, I landed two yolks in one egg, and now this. It's turning out to be quite a day. - That's right. - Hello. - Hi. - Shall we? Sure! Fate. This weather, right? Yeah. Mm. Oh, I know. What would be your perfect date? Like... What do you, uh, what do you see? Nico, I hate to interrupt you. Um, you seem like a lovely person, but I'm just not feeling a romantic spark between us, so maybe we should just be friends? But your friend said that you... - He said... - I'm sorry about that. Um, it's a little complicated. Oh, okay, that's okay. Um, but thank you for the coffee. - Oh, you're leaving. - Yes. Yeah, sure. Okay. Thank you for the coffee. Oh, no, no, you're welcome. Have a good day. How did it go with fate? That wasn't fate, that was you. Come on, what do you want, a sign from above? Oh, um, what were you saying about fate? You're going with me. Oh, I would be honored. Okay, so I think I have the essence of the character down. I wanted to give Ollie a little mischief. You know, he's the type of kid that you can't help but like even though he's a pain sometimes. Um, so what's the verdict? Uh, yeah, I can tell you worked really hard on these. Is that it? Um, got anything else? It's just not really what I had in mind. You're joking, right? This is just your dark sense of humor? No, no, look, I think they're great. It's just, you know, not what I'm looking for. What are you looking for? I don't know, I'll... know it when I see it. Well, that's not very helpful. Look, they're just... These pictures, they're just... You can't just do the words on the page. It's a book about a kid who finds gross things. Oh, okay, I see. So it's a bad book and why even try, right? No. Look, point is, you're thinking inside the box. Oh, and let me guess, I need to think outside the box. No! There is no box. Oh. Just don't force it. Hm. I got an idea. We're gonna take a field trip. - A field trip? - Yeah. - Where? - Somewhere where you're gonna find a little inspiration. Pick you up at 8:30. Wear walking shoes. So, what exactly did you have planned? Welcome to Miami's premier and only alpaca farm. And this is gonna help me how? Stick with me, Jenny Newlove, all right? This is gonna be good for you. Giddy up. So you want me to draw alpacas? No. You're still thinking too literal. We are outside the office right now. You got to open up your mind. Yeah, and open up my nose to new smells. That's exactly right. Mm, breathe in that country air, Jenny Newlove. Uh-huh. And, so, what do I do? Just look at them and then leave? No, we are just getting started. Okay. Pull. Can you walk? I think Barbara likes you. Well, it's reciprocated. She's the nicest llama alpaca I met all day. Sorry, Kevin, but it's true. I don't think Kevin minds. I think he's the strong and silent type, you know? Yeah, maybe. Is this always how you get your inspiration? Yeah. Anything that gets the neurons going. You know? I'll go to the art gallery, I'll go the aquarium, I'll head down by the river, spend the day. Oh, it's okay. Hm, not what I was expecting. Oh, why? Because I write books for cheap laughs? You don't think I take my process seriously, huh? Oh, come on. Yeah, kinda. Okay, well, I'll have you know that the books that I published, I enjoyed writing, okay? Oh, so you're a tortured artist. I'm pragmatic. I like telling stories that make kids laugh, and I just need to write more books. Hm. Why children's books? I was a grade school teacher. - Really? - Okay, don't act so surprised. Well, I am surprised that you were responsible for children's education. Okay, I'll have you know that I was actually very good at it. I used to make up stories all the time. It's okay. I used to make up stories, and I would tell the kids the stories and then they would love 'em. I just knew I needed to make a switch when I had more stories than lessons. Oh. Do you miss it? Sometimes, yeah. But, um, when I write a book and I get to go on my publicity tour and do my readings, it scratches that itch. Anyway, I haven't had a hit in a while, so kind of got a lot riding on this book. And that's where I come in. Yes. Laura thinks I should be more realistic, you know? That I, um, should go back to teaching and I can't live off my book royalties for the rest of my life. - Come on. - Well, I don't think you should give up on your passion. Yeah? Like you haven't given up on your dream wedding? Yes, exactly. Yeah. What's that, Barbara? You want to be a bridesmaid? Oh, I am so sorry, Barbara, but I'm actually not having bridesmaids. Oh, don't... don't say that around her. Okay? She just wants to look pretty in the photos, don't you, Barbara? But, no, no one wants an alpaca in their wedding. Actually, Kevin told me that Barbara goes to weddings all the time. She's constantly guilt-tripping people into inviting her. Barbara! And you had me feeling sorry for you. You little manipulative alpaca. Who knew? So, um, I think it would be a shame to not get the sketchpad out. I mean, you draw, right? You did all the other art for your other books. I draw, yes. I just kinda have... my style's more of a DIY aesthetic. Well, I think Kevin and Barbara need a portrait. Don't you? Okay, yeah, I guess I do. Okay, are you ready for the quickdraw alpaca portrait challenge? Bring it on, Jenny Newlove. Okay. You have 60 seconds. All right. Okay. Wait! Hold on. What? I need more time! Okay, go. - Stop. Stop cheating! - Okay, okay, all right. ♪ Hold my hand Are you posing for us, Barbara? ♪ Shine the light ♪ Till the darkness lifts Oh. No! ♪ Hold me up so I don't look weak ♪ Okay. Time's up. Really hope I got Barbara's best side. Oh, I hope that you did because she will be very upset if you didn't. - Yeah. - All right, ready? - Reveal on three. - Okay. - One, two, three! - Three, two, one, now! What... That's, um... cute. Okay, wait. You did not just draw that in 60 seconds. Where is the... You've been working on that for a week. Where's the one you just drew? This is it. Wow. Just... wow. I mean, the lines are still a little bit messed up. It's just a little sketch. No, you're... seriously so talented. Thank you. Bye, Kevin! Thanks for being such a good walking partner. Aw, I'm gonna miss that girl. They're really a good example to us all, you know? - Such a tight couple. - Yeah. Um, thanks for taking me today. I actually enjoyed it. I did too. Thank you for being... open-minded. Yeah. And now I get to go home and get dressed for speed dating. Hey, maybe if you're lucky you can find your own Kevin. Uck, I could only dream. Um, what are you doing tonight? Laura's flying into town from New York. We have a couple days together. That's nice. I know long distance relationships are hard. Yeah, well, you just have to, you know, make the most out of the time you have together. You have to. Yeah. You don't need to rush the sketches. Just take your time and... let your magic happen. I'm still not quite sure what all that was supposed to be about but, um, yeah, sure. This is exciting! Your future husband could be somewhere in this room. The competition looks fierce. Oh, come on, they've got nothing on you. I don't need to date ten men, I just need to date him. - What? - I said I don't need to date ten men, I just need to date him. Okay, that is mortifying. Oh, come on, it's totally working, he's checking you out. - Really? - Yeah. Gosh, he'd make a beautiful husband. - Aiden! - What? I can't believe you talked me into this! You know, for someone who doesn't want to be here, you sure have made quite the effort. It's just my normal weekday evening attire. Okay, so how does this work again? Did you download the app for the event? I sent you the link. - Yeah. - I did it yesterday. Oh, well, great. Uh, let's see. We'll each have ten dates, five minutes each date. After each date, you pick yay or nay in the app. And then... Well, if you match. Oh, if we like each other, it's a match? - Yes, exactly. - Okay. So if you both like each other, then you see the other person's contact info and you're one step closer to finding your future life partner. Okay. - Well, hello. - Oh! - Oh, hi. - Oh, nice company. Second date. - That's right. - Don't worry. You look fabulous. Thanks. - Second date? - Oh, uh, don't ask. Oh. I know there are folks who get creeped out by taxidermy, but what better way to respect an animal than to preserve its body forever? I've never thought about it like that. I have 30 branches around the state. The plan long term is to step back in 7-10 years. Wow. Well, that is fantastic. Unbelievable. Who did your nails? These are a work of art. Thank you. You should see my wolf. He's magnificent. Everybody, it's time to mix it up. Go ahead and move on to the next table, and who knows, you might just be five minutes away from finding true love. Welcome. - Hi. - I know you. Hey, hey, hey, this is date ♪6 and check out this babe! Oh! I wanna see all my followers give me a heart emoji if you think I should give her my number. Do you know that in '98 I released the best-selling album in Bosnia? Yeah, one week... No, two weeks #1. Well, then I'd say 1998 was a very good year for you. Wait, say hey to my followers. Oh, wow. If you don't find anybody tonight, then hey, you could always hit me up. I'm recently divorced and have a sweet apartment in my mom's basement. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - I'm Jenny. Thank you for not livestreaming our date. All right, lovebirds, if you like who you're with, you can always mark 'em on the app but it's time to move on to the next table. So? Wait, this is weird. Oh, come on, don't knock it. I'm the best you had all night. Oh, wait. Oh no, dreamboat turned into a speedboat. I only had one date left. Is he trying that badly to avoid me? Oh, that can't be. He's the only one I wanted to talk to. Honey, I'm so sorry. Hey, it's that time again. Time's up with your lovebirds. Move on to the next table. And find your future mate. Or not. Or maybe you're just standing there alone. If you haven't found anybody, it's, uh... it's time to take a look inside. This new artist, how's it going? Pretty good, I think. Does this mean you have to share the royalties with her though? Yeah. If the book does well, we both benefit. What if it doesn't? I'm not really thinking like that, Laura. All I mean is you could always go back to teaching. Yeah, maybe I will. I know writing is your passion but it's a regular income, which is important. Look, Laura, can we just see how this book goes first? I'm just being realistic. But hey... it's great to be in the same room for once. Yeah, you can say that again. Who's that? Nobody, it's just a friend. The manuscript's at the printer's right now and we expect to have about 10,000 copies ready to ship by the end of the week. Okay. Uh, that's great. Thank you. Can I help? I'm calling a team meeting. I'm in the middle of something. You're a core member. Okay, so app dating was a no-go and speed dating was... No. You do not need to relive that, okay? You just need to feel the burn and move on with your life. Oh, right, sure, everyone come in, it's just my office. It's not like I have work to do. Hey, sorry, I was just dropping off that contract at the front desk but no one was there. Oh, I wonder why that is. We need a plan to find Jenny a husband, and fast. The more heads the better. Come on. Clara, you were right. Forcing the idea just isn't happening. So let me get this straight. You want to go out of your way to meet a man to marry in just a few weeks but without trying? Yeah, exactly. I'm waiting for serendipity to happen. Well, serendipity can't be planned. Okay, but let's just think of it as creating an atmosphere for serendipity to happen. What about the food hall downtown? No, I think I would just feel like I was picking a guy up. Isn't that exactly what you're doing? It needs to be an environment where love can flourish. Hmm! A class might work. Actually, I have an idea. I've been taking a mindfulness class at the art gallery down by the waterfront. I hadn't realized you were in touch with your inner zen. Yeah, well, I've had some spare time on my hands with Laura in New York. Anyway, point is, there's some single guys in the class if you want to come check it out. That is really good thinking. Calmness is an excellent quality in a husband. You wanna check it out with me? Yeah. It's worth a try. Hey, did you get any inspiration from the llama and alpaca? Oh, I actually did. I have some new sketches, maybe you could pick me up later and we could go over them? Yeah! Absolutely. I'll see you later tonight. - Great. - Okay. I'll go. Great seeing everybody. Alpacas? Oh, yeah, don't ask. That class sounds hot... Why are you still here? - Sorry. - Oh, sorry. Okay, I know that the sketches are a little bit rough but just maybe imagine them with color. Uh, yeah, no, just can you soften the background a little bit? I just want the characters to pop more. Yeah, yeah, I can do that. Um, anything else? No, these are incredible. - Really? - Yes! Yes. This is the exact level of warmth I was telling you about. Okay, great. Well, I'll work on getting some more polished sketches together. All right. You sure you still wanna put your name on my crumby book? Yeah. I think it's good to be challenged in a new way. Hm. Challenged, huh? Yeah, I think you and my girlfriend would agree, I am kind of challenging, aren't I? I don't mean it in a personal way. You've actually not been as annoying as I thought you were gonna be. Oh, not as annoying as you thought I was gonna be, huh? I should put that on the back of my book. You know what I mean. Mm-hm. So, if I didn't help you at the Spanish monastery, would you really have walked away from all this? Yeah. I think so. It's important to do things wholeheartedly. I mean, otherwise, what's the point? You know? But I will admit, it has been good to try something different. Yeah. Well, hey, at least you didn't hate the whole process. Okay, that is actually what you can put on the back of the book. "Jenny Newlove did not hate illustrating this story." Oh. Yeah, I think with a ringing endorsement like that, it'll actually fly right off the shelves. Oh shoot, the mindfulness class. I think it's about to start, we should go, right? Um, right. Yes, that is starting soon, so yeah, let's go. These are so good. I had a wise grams when I was an awkward teenager. Ohh, a wise grams. Yeah. I was an emo kid. I was all fringe and eyeliner. And I used to get upset when the girls didn't like me back, so she would make me take my headphones out and she would say to me, "Happiness is like a butterfly. If you chase it, it'll fly away, but if you sit still, it might just... land on your shoulder." Hm. That's really sweet. Yeah. The last thing I wanted to hear at the time, but the older I get the more I realize that she was right. - What? - Nothing. You're just... different than I thought you would be. Different? - Mm-hm. - In a good way? Hello, everyone. Welcome to tonight's class. I see some familiar faces here in the back. This guy's great. Nice to see you. And, uh, I see some newbies. Hi. Welcome. Hi. - You okay? - Yeah. I'm gonna give you guys a minute to, uh, get situated and get comfortable and then we'll get started. Okay? What is he doing here? Who, Blake? He runs the whole gallery and the wellness class. - What? Do you know him? - No, he's just a guy that definitely wasn't attracted to me at speed dating. It's so embarrassing. Okay, just tell me about the single guys. Oh, okay, okay, okay. That's Marcel. Quiet, but super cool guy. Works construction. He went to Haiti this past year, built a whole hospital. - That's so nice. - Right? And that, that guy right over there, - Harris. - Okay. He's been divorced a couple years but it's totally amicable. He and his wife were high school sweethearts and the marriage had run its course. Okay, great. So both have potential. - Hmm. - Um, what do I do now? What do you mean? We're in the middle of a mindfulness class. I can't just walk up to 'em and say, "Hey, I know you're looking for inner peace but would you take me for a drink?" I don't... You're new here, just strike up some conversation. Ask for advice. Ask for advice, yeah. Okay. You're not moving. This is nerve-wracking, okay? I'm psyching myself up. Just hold on. Breathe in calm, breath out tension. Jenny? You are talking to another human being, okay? You don't need to pump yourself up to get a cup of coffee, do you? No. Look, I mean this in a very platonic way but you're an attractive woman, you're funny, you're kind, you're cool, you got a great personality, and you're talented. I mean, talking to these guys, it's gonna be the highlight of their week. Okay? Come on, you got this. - Gosh. - Right? Now get in there. Let's go. Come on. Come on! Let's see it. Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! Okay. Just give me a... Shh. Stop it. - I'm not even here. - Great. Shh. Shh! Hey! I'm new to this whole mindfulness baloney... Well, that's the wrong word. I am all for mindfulness and being present and in the moment, I've just never been present with people before. I mean, I have definitely been in a room with people before, I just haven't been, you know, in a mindful... Oh my... I am so sorry! Hey, no... no harm done, it's okay. - Was that expensive? - Uh... Oh gosh, it was expensive, wasn't it? Yeah, maybe... maybe it was. I'm sorry. Hey, have we... met you before? I feel like I've met you before. Mm-mm. No. Uh, no, I just have a familiar face. Uh... Speed dating, right? Yeah. Uh, guilty. I was the girl you were trying desperately to avoid. Oh, no, I wasn't trying to avoid you at all, no. Really? Well, then why didn't you stay till the end? I had to come here actually. Our alarm went off and we have some kind of expensive stuff here in the gallery so I had to just come back and make sure everything was okay. Oh, um, well, was it? Yeah, the alarm's just a little sensitive sometimes. But you know, when I got back to the bar, I was disappointed because... they told me you already left. Really? Yeah, you were... the only woman I was interested in there. Oh. Really? I have to do this class. But you should totally come back sometime and, uh, I'll give you a private tour. That... that would be great. Excellent. - Okay. - Let's do it. Mm-hm. Um, okay, everyone. Hey! You seem different. I don't know what you mean. Hmm. It's not your hair. That look is the same arty chic. I've got it. You're loved up. No, no, no, you're gliding around like you're in some sort of little cloud or something. Okay, I think "loved up" is a little bit strong. I want to know everything. Okay. I have a date with the dreamboat. The dreamboat? The dreamboat. Dreamboat! Oh, dreamboat! Yeah. Yes, I saw him last night at the class with Tyler. The whole speed dating thing, that was just a mix-up. Uh, what's his name? Blake Whitlock. Why? I have to do my due diligence. Let's see. No red flags on his profile. No questionable political opinions. Last year, he did a triathlon to raise money for a child literacy project. Oh, uh, he can play the piano. Cool. He likes David Bowie. Way cool. It seems like he can dance. It's like someone went inside my mind and made this perfect man. I mean, this is actually happening! You're getting married, baby. Okay, well, maybe I should go on the date first before I just get carried away. Blake has to be the one. Well, yeah, I hope so. I'm running outta time. So this is actually my favorite part of the gallery. We have some really special painters here. Mondrian, Moreau, Chagall. Oh, Chagall. Yeah. He's my favorite and "The Lovers" is my favorite piece that he has. And I've been trying to get it here but it's actually on tour right now in Europe, so no luck. It's my favorite too. - Is it? - Mm-hm. Oh. Is everything okay? Oh, um... couldn't be better. Great. You know, I'm really glad that you're enjoying the gallery. Yeah, I am too. Um... you know, if you wanted to ask me to dinner, I might say yes. - Might? - Mm-hm. I mean, I can't promise anything, but... Okay, um... if you can't promise it, then I'm just gonna go ahead and take the risk. Would you like to go to dinner with me? Firm yes. Great. Do you wanna see the rest of the gallery? Sure. Let's continue. Let's go this way. Oh. - Hey! - Hey. Uh, wow. You look great. Oh, thanks. I just got back from a date with you-know-who. Oh, yeah. - Um, how'd it go? Good? - Great. We already have our second date in the books, so I don't know, I think it might actually be happening. That's amazing. Oh, I do need a little bit more time with the sketches though. I know, I'm sorry. You know we have this meeting coming with Clara, right? It won't take me long. Jenny, I can't afford to wait around for this. I need this book to hit the shelves. I totally get it. All right. I know you're busy with this wedding and everything. Yeah. So how's it going with Blake? You think he's gonna be the one? I don't know, maybe! I mean, we have so much in common, I'm super relaxed when I'm around him and I mean, you've seen him. He is not unattractive. Woo. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I guess if we're not gonna do this, I'll take off. Laura's coming into town from New York tonight and I want to do something extra special, so. Oh, that's so nice. She's a lucky lady. When is she moving back? Soon. Hopefully. Nice. Well, um, I'll see you later. Great seeing... you look incredible. - Thank you. - Yeah. See ya. Tyler, I'm so sorry. You're not in Miami. I had an important work meeting. It ran over. I missed the four o'clock flight. Okay. Do you want me to come to New York? We're in the middle of a big project. I'm gonna have to work all weekend anyways. Yeah. Listen, Laura. We gotta talk about where this is headed. Yeah. I think it's time. Wow. Great. Was I right or was I right? - Yes! - You think we're ready to send to the printer? I think we're ready to push on. Great job, you guys. I mean... I knew you'd make a great team. Yeah. Um... so I've been thinking about what Jenny said to me the first day we met, about my writing. Gosh, you must have thought I was so arrogant. No, no, no. I think you're passionate and uncompromising and... hanging out with you has made me realize that I've been settling for second best in more ways than one. She has that effect on people. What I'm trying to say is... um... things have happened recently and I've had a perspective shift and I want to write a new book and I want to challenge myself to write something that's gonna be honest and meaningful. I think that's a great idea. Well, um... I was hoping you'd want to work on it with me. I'd love to see what you could come up with on a project that you actually care about. Yeah, I'd... I'd... I'd really love that. Did you have anything in mind? Um, I'm toying around with a couple different ideas. Well, you should do a book about your grandmother's butterfly. You know, the one that flies around the world, spreading happiness to everybody. Well, only those who don't chase it. Yes. That's exactly what we'll do. - Right? - God, you're a genius. Oh, well, I don't know if you should say "genius," but if you want to use that word... Right. Project Butterfly. I like it. I'm very excited to see where this could go. Hey! Sorry, I don't mean to just pop in on you like this but I was in the area, thought I'd bring you lunch. How sweet of you! Can I bring 'em in? Oh, um... If right now's a bad time, I totally get it, - I can come... - Um, no, no, no. No. Uh, come in, come in. Oh, great. All right. Are you sure right now isn't a bad time? Oh, it's actually great. I'm really hungry, so this is perfect. Okay, there are plates back there? No. That's not the kitchen? It is the kitchen but it's really messy. I'm not gonna judge. It's totally... You... you... you just stay right here and I will be right back. Okay. One second! Are you sure everything's okay in here? - Um, yeah. It's raccoons. - I'm sorry, what? Oh, they just get into the trash and the noise... Do you need me to help? They don't like loud noises, so yeah, it's all good, they're gone now. Oh, okay. Um, let's just go into... the living room. Um, those bagels look delicious. So yeah, I've been in Miami for five years now and I love it here. There's a great music scene, there's never been more foot traffic at the gallery. It's great. That's great. I'm just surprised we haven't run into each other before. I know. Fate works in mysterious ways, right? It really does, doesn't it? Is that the book you've been working on? Oh. Wow. The... The art in here is... amazing. Seriously, really, really good. Thank you. The writing's a little hacky though, I have to say. How did this guy get you on board? Oh no, he's actually really good. He really knows the market. Okay, to each their own, I guess. I just... I think you can do better, that's all. Oh, uh, well, we're working on a new book. It has a very different tone. Oh. Oh, geez, I gotta get back. I have a meeting this afternoon. Sorry. Oh, sounds exciting. Well, thank you again for lunch. It was a pleasure. Hey, I'm really glad that fate brought us together eventually. I am too. Message me, okay? Let's do this again soon. - Mm-hm. - Oh, and, uh, you should really have an exterminator come out here and have a look at those raccoons. Whole thing. - Right. - See ya. Okay, bye! ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah - Hello? - Hey, so, um, I was thinking about the book and, um, so it could be a series and in each story there's a different child going through a difficult situation in their lives. Uh, yeah. I like it. Yeah, and then the butterfly is with them the whole way through but they don't see it and then in the end, it sits on their shoulder and they realize that whatever it was they thought that they were going through, it's in the past now and they're through it. What do you think? Um, yeah, it sounds good, um, but, listen, it's getting late and I have a date with Blake tomorrow, so, um, do you mind if we get back to this? Yeah, sure. Okay, bye. I do too! Scrambled eggs in the morning. Yes. You know, I've really enjoyed exploring the market with you, but, uh, all day there's been something else on my mind. Oh, really? Well, um, maybe you should tell me because maybe it's been on my mind too. I'm thinking it probably has been. The one time when you almost destroyed a $10,000 sculpture. Oh my gosh, $10,000? I'm so sorry. No, it's totally fine. I'm glad you saved it. But actually that's not what I've been thinking about all day. Oh, um... I... I think I left my phone inside. Yes, I... could you maybe go look for it? I... I'm so sorry, I'll take a look here. And you... okay, thanks. Sorry. Gosh. Hi! Jenny, hi! Hi! How are you? I'm great. Great. I'm just picking up a few last-minute items before my trip. How's the prep going? Oh, um, it's great. There was a couple issues, but everything's getting ironed out, so it should be good. Glad to hear it. And Tyler's good? - Yes! - Is he with you? Oh, he is actually diving, you know, another expedition. - Oh, busy guy. - Mm-hm! Well, anyways, good luck with everything. You too, have a great vacation. - Thank you so much. - Okay, bye. I'm really sorry, it was gone by the time I got back there. Oh, it's fine, don't even worry about it. Oh, okay, well, you should at least call the provider and have 'em freeze it up for you. Oh, okay. Oh! I am such a scatterbrain. I... I am so sorry. I must have had it on me the whole time. That's okay, that's okay. I'm just glad it back. Thank you for checking on it, really. You're my hero. No worries. Um... Should we keep looking around? - Sure. - Okay. You are so lucky you're cute. All right, calling her again. Let's just start without her. Right. Your new book. Yeah. Well, I love it. Really? It's on a different level than anything else you've ever written. I mean, at the heart of the story, there's a sadness and a truth, but ultimately it teaches that patience has a reward greater than any quick fix. That's exactly what I was going for. So you think this is a good direction for me? Most books end up in a grocery bargain bin. This one is going to sit on kids' shelves for a really long time. Has Jenny read it? Uh, I sent it to her, but she's been busy. She said she was gonna call you yesterday. Yeah, well, one word: Blake. - Does she know? - Know what? That you and Laura broke up. What does that have to do with anything? Because you like her. I don't like her. We're collaborators, and she's happy with Blake. What kind of name is that anyways? Blake? I mean, he sounds like a cheesy, corny soap opera actor. Right. So you're not jealous at all then. Jealous of Blake? Blake. No, I'm not jealous of Blake. Okay. What? I am so close I can almost taste the canapés. I just might need your help with one little challenge. I knew it! The bachelorette party. Okay, not quite, but this could be as fun. Go on. The wedding is a week away. Blake is the one. He has to be. He just might need a little help realizing it. And so this is where we come in. Just drop a few hints. Tell him not to move so slow and, I don't know, maybe proposing would be a good idea. You are a 21st century woman. You could ask him. I don't want to be desperate. Really, honey, 'cause I hate to break it to you... Okay, I know you two can do it. Come on, we're so close. We'll do our best. Have you read Tyler's manuscript yet? It's really special. Oh, is it? I knew he had it in him. But no, I haven't had a chance yet. Well, at least give him a call. He's been trying to get a hold of you. I will. I will call. Good luck. Is it a display or a fruit stand? Oh, I think it has something to do with gravity. - Oh, hey, guys. - Hi. Uh, is, uh, Jenny not with you today or... Oh, no, she's... she's hard at work in her studio. And making the magic happen. We had the afternoon off, so we thought we'd stop by, take a look around. This is... Interesting piece. It is, right? We feel that by placing everyday items on display like this, it makes people see them in a whole different light. - Oh. - Appreciate the art behind these objects, you know? So like the smoothness of the peel, the vibrancy of the red of this apple, you know? I was just explaining this to Clara, but she doesn't get it. She's a philistine. It's easy to be cynical about art. I get it. But, um, why don't I show you guys around, and, um, by the time we're done with the tour of this place, you're gonna see it in a whole different light. Well, that would be great, thanks. I'm not a philistine. Oh, and speaking of Jenny, actually, and she would hate it if I said this, but she hasn't been this happy with a man in a long time. Oh, that's true. Yeah, I really like her too. She's a beautiful person. She's had a lot of short-term relationships. Yeah, but nothing seems to stick. I think she'd really love it if this one went the distance. You know, if you were to become more serious, I think it would be really good for her. Yeah, you can't move too fast with her, that's all we're saying. Okay, are you guys just dropping not-so-subtle hints right now, is that... is that what's going on here? It's just that, um, Jenny's our friend, and we want what's best for her, and you're a really big part of that, Blake. Okay. Let's have a look over here. I know we've only known each other for a short period of time, right? Go on. But I think we have something really special here. I do too. And when you hit your 30s, there's just no point in taking things slowly. So... I have something really important that I want to ask you. Will you... move to Paris with me? Oh, I... I didn't want to say anything until now 'cause I thought it was gonna cast a shadow over things. Paris? Yeah, I've been offered a job managing a gallery right off the Champs-Élysées. It's a dream job, and I have to leave tomorrow, but if you want to come with me, I'll book you a seat on the flight. I can't fly to Paris in two days. What? Did you know about this and not tell me? I am telling you right now. I don't... I don't want us to be over. I thought you were gonna propose. Oh, gosh. I mean, do you have to go? Yeah. It's a huge opportunity for me, and I've already signed a lease on an apartment. I can't... I can't just turn this opportunity down, Jenny. We're supposed to get married in two days. Did you think we were gonna go to Vegas or something? - No. - Okay, so how were we gonna get married in two days then? I booked a wedding. I'm sorry. What? I was supposed to get married on my 35th birthday. A fortune teller predicted it. I thought that asking you to come to Paris with me was rushing things, but marriage after just a couple weeks? But I've fallen for you. You sure? Or maybe you just wanted it so bad that you convinced yourself of that. Jenny, I like you, but you have to tell me something. Did you have this whole thing planned out when you met me? Yeah, yeah, that's... That is too much. It's like everything that we had wasn't real. No, it was. It was real. You kept this from me the entire time. And... And now I think it's time for us to go our separate ways. I'm really sorry this didn't go how you planned. No, just... Oh, um, hi. Hey. You haven't been answering my calls or emails. I just wanted to make sure you have that. Um, yeah, thanks. Clara said it was really great. Yeah, so, you haven't read it. I'm sorry, I just haven't gotten the chance yet. Yeah, just don't say it. It's really not a great time. When is? I get it. You wanted me to help you with your wedding, but you never wanted to work with me. No, that's not it. I didn't in the beginning, but... but... but now I do. Why do I feel like I'm alone in this? I'm sorry, I've just had other things going on. Yeah. And don't we all know it. You know, you live in this fantasy world where you think that all the cosmos and all the planets, they just revolve all around you. What about everybody else? Huh? What about all the people that... that don't have love, that aren't gonna have the perfect wedding? Was that their fortune that was just laid out for them, but Jenny Newlove gets everything that she wants? I mean, is that really how you think the world spins? Oh, okay, so you were fine to play along when it worked for you. I worked really hard on Ollie Slick, even though... You thought it was dumb. I wasn't gonna say that, okay? But now you put your heart into something and you want me to just drop everything and say, "Good for you, Tyler." Great. Congrats. You know, you made me believe in myself and I did. And I thought we could make something special together, and I just wanted to share that with you. I'm sorry. Fine. Let's just drop it. Forget about it. Tyler. Oh, honey. Goodness. Now that it's all over, I just realize what a fool I've been. Don't say that. I mean, it's okay, you can laugh. It's kind of funny, I guess. No one's laughing. You even had me believing. We both wanted this to work out so much. Can you still make a go of it with Blake? I mean, forget the wedding. I don't know. I think I was just trying to force something that wasn't even there. And now I've upset Tyler. I mean, he doesn't even want anything to do with me. You tell the venue yet? No. I need to go over and tell them in person. I mean, they've put so much hard work into this wedding. I... I feel awful. No, no, it's okay. Actually, why don't we go with you? We've been with you since the beginning. We might as well see this through to the end. Thank you. Oh, I do have one more favor to ask of you though, Aiden. What? You got this. Are those from Clara? Sit here. Jenny, actually. She asked me to get these to you as soon as I could. Oh, um... We're not working on the book anymore. That's not what she thinks. She's busy. She's starting her marriage with the perfect man. You don't know. The wedding's off. Blake's on a plane to Paris as we speak. He had his chance with the best woman in the world and he blew it. When did all this happen? Yesterday afternoon. I need to show these to you. She was up half the night working on them. Why didn't she tell me? Now I've got everything on USB. I spoke to the editor. She's ready to put pictures to words and words to pictures. That is, if you still want to move forward with this project? This is stunning. Now I see why you wanted to get married here so much. I know. But one day, when you have a wedding, blow this out of the water. Maybe. Oh, it will. I was just so certain that Madam Lotus' predictions would come true. Like night follows day, I would wake up on my 35th birthday and marry the most perfect man. And now, my future's just such a mystery. Well, that's not a bad thing. Yeah, but think of all those years that I took for granted, thinking that love was just written in the stars. Oh, um, excuse me, do you know where the events manager is? Oh, thanks. Jenny, you're already loved so much. Think about all the people that came to Miami to celebrate with you. Right, and now I'm gonna have to tell them that I wasted their time. Not necessarily. I mean, it is still your birthday. You hired out this spectacular venue. It'd be a shame to see it all go to waste. It would be quite the extravagant birthday party. Why do you only get to pull out all the stops when a man is involved? Why don't we celebrate you? And all the love people have for you? Be right back. Oh! Hm. This is exciting. What? What is it? The wedding, it's still on. But it's a birthday party, right? So cool. Oh my God, fantastic. Except now I've got so much to do. Whew. You just need to change. Oh, oh my goodness, you were serious. You're so sweet. No, this is not an accident, honey. You should come. Oh, uh, I don't really think Jenny wants to see me right now. That woman put her heart and soul into those drawings. Come to the party. You might enjoy yourself. You look incredible. - Really? - Yeah. Blake really missed out. Aw, thank you. You look great. Oh, pfsh, this? Come on. I'm so excited. You should be. It's your big day. We've gotta share a drink or something. Hello! Right? Hey, guys. Yes, everything... Mom! Hi. Dad. Hey. Oh. I'm so glad you guys came. Really sorry to interrupt, but if you knew about this mind-blowing gossip and didn't tell me, I do not even know you. No, I did not know. So, we need to, um, talk about all this. I believe you've already met Nico. Are you two... Um, I'm a very lucky man. Would never have even met him if it wasn't for you. Speed dating. Well, hey, at least you met somebody. Well, this is great though, right? I know. I can't believe everybody came. They came for you, 'cause they love you. You know that, right? Well, I do now. Um, I am very thirsty. Let's just please get some champagne. - Champagne. - Yes, yes indeed. Okay. Go ahead. - You look good. - You too, baby. Thank you. Happy birthday! ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ Ooh hoo ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ Here's to the future ♪ Here's to the future ♪ Uh, lately I've been a little preoccupied in my life looking for the one to love that I forgot, I have so many people already who I love so much and who also love me back. So I'm very, very, very thankful to have you guys all here to celebrate my birthday. You know, I met someone recently who had a big impact on my life, more than I realized until now. And he told me that happiness is like a butterfly. If you chase it, it'll fly away. But if you sit still... it might land on your shoulder. And I think my butterfly has finally landed. And I hope it lands on all of you too. So, please raise a glass to the butterfly. To the butterfly! Everybody have so much fun! - Hey. - Hey. I didn't know you were coming. Well, I was waiting for your present to be ready. Me? Yeah. Open it, yes. Thank you. I love it. Hey, um... Could you go outside with me for a minute? Yes. Sure. Sorry. I'm sorry about yesterday. If I would have known, I, um... No, I'm... I'm sorry. We had a deal, and I didn't hold up on my end of the bargain. I am, I'm sorry. I'm glad you didn't scrap your book idea though. Yeah, me too. Where's Laura? You should have brought her. Um... We broke up. What? Why? What happened? The distance was more than just geography. Oh. Um... Well, I'm... I'm sorry anyway. Ah, don't be. Um, that relationship had been ending for a long time. I just never really realized it until, uh... Until I started spending time with you. You make me happy, Jenny, and excited, and everything feels right when I'm with you. And when I'm not with you... I miss you. I wish I knew you felt that way sooner. Really? Yes. I've spent the last few weeks just laughing, and, I don't know, sometimes when we were pretending that you were my fiancé, I kind of wished you were. Well... You were with Blake. And you seemed happy. And I didn't want to be the one to ruin that. I guess the timing was all off. Well, how's the timing now? Seems perfect. Come on. Happy birthday. Thank you. Wondered where you'd got to. Mom, Dad, um... Hi. Clint, Meredith. I've heard so much about you guys. Wait a second. You haven't introduced your parents to your fiancé? Um, not quite. Um, it's a long story. Why don't we leave them alone? Looks like they're in the middle of a beautiful new collaboration. We'll be right in. One sec. Um, where were we? Here I think.
