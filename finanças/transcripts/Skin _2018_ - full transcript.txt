Stay, come on. Snakes have many predators, also. They have birds, raccoons, foxes. So that's why they have camouflage. And how do I know which ones are dangerous, - and which ones aren't? - Snakes have scales on the bottom of their head. And their body. They're called scoots. And they use the scoots for moving. They don't have legs. Using their scoots, they push their scoots out to move. - Really? - Um hmm. - Wow. - Snakes have colorful bodies, and they use that to warn predators that they're venomous. But in some places, they have bright colors, but they're not venomous. So that is to scare predators. Hey, I'm venomous, don't come towards me. But they're really not. - Right. - And they'll be like, hey, go away. I might have not colorful colors, but I'm still venomous. Major predators, it sounds like. Kind of feels like, if I was identifying a poisonous snake, I really want to look for the color. The brighter the color, the more venomous, maybe. Yes. So once they're striking, you want to move out of the way. Troy, stop feeding Boss. OK. Keep eating. I want you to finish everything you have, OK? - Yes, ma'am. - Yes ma'am. - Dad? - Um hmm. Can we go surfing? No. Why don't you finish your breakfast first? - OK.- And then we can talk about it. - And who's gonna clean him up, after? - We are. - You are? - Yeah. You are? OK.

Local police are still searching for Jeffrey Hall. The 36-year old man was kidnapped 10 days ago, as his eight year old son watched the abduction. Hey, Krista, is everything OK?
