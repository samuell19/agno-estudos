I was thinking we might switch back to seeing each other once a month. Yeah, I'm feeling like I'm in a really good place. You know, like, I've done the work. We've done the work. We've done it. Have you spoken with your father recently? Well, I... He called, but I did not pick up. He knows the conditions. - So you set a boundary? - Yeah. That must have been very difficult for you. Not really. No. I'm feeling really resolute. Like, very resolute. So resolute, in fact... I was thinking, is this the best time to set a boundary? You know, stay with me here, because I'm wondering... Maybe it would be best if I did pick up. - You know? - I don't. Uh, okay, well, it wouldn't be, like, to ask for help or anything like that. Like, I'm not discounting years of disappointment, years... And abandonment. Well, I was going to say missed opportunities, but, yeah, sure, yeah, let's just say abandonment. Your father is incapable of helping you, Laura. It doesn't matter how much you love him. He's never gonna change. I know. You're right. I know. I was just testing you that time to see if you had softened. Ha-ha. You're not that little girl who needs her father's love and attention anymore. You're doing just fine on your own. I know. Yeah, you're right. I know. I know. You're right. I am. I really am. I don't know why I keep forgetting that. I do notice you have a kitten hidden in your purse. Were you hiding it from me? No, of course not. I wasn't hiding it from you. I... I found it in the, in the parking lot. I thought that you weren't gonna pick up any stray animals this month. Well, it's the 28th, so technically, if it was February, it is the end of the month. Not February. Yeah, but I have secured a home for this kitty, so it's different. I think our hour is up. Hey. I can feed her. I'm already up. That would be wonderful. Thank you, honey. Yeah. - That douchebag sleep over? - Yeah, he did. Yeah. But he's actually a pretty good guy. I wish you'd give him a chance. Did you... Oh, come on, Henry. Just let me have one date. How about, if you act really normal in the morning, I'll drive you to school? Crouton peed more blood, but she passed the stone. - She did? - Yeah. I put it in a Ziploc bag in the fridge. Oh, I love that you did that. I love that. Thank you. Hey, maybe you'll be a vet. Wouldn't that be an incredible end to our story? Or I could be a taxidermist. I think you're great. Shh. Shh. Shh. Taco. Taco, you get up here. - What the fuck? - What happened? - Your fucking cat ran over my face. - What? I thought you said no animals in the bed. I did. Get off! Get off! Am I bleeding? Uh, not really, no. Just... It's just, like, a... It's a little nick. Damn it. Jesus Christ, Laura, you have way too many fucking animals. Seriously. Am I gonna get cat-scratch fever or something? Oh, there's no such thing. There's no such thing. Go back to bed. I got to get out of here. Oh, good. Good. - That's fucking great. - Tino! - Yeah. - Oh, I... This is really out of the ordinary, I swear. People are usually like, "You have nine animals? "It only seems like you have four." Laura, I think you're great. I really do. And it's super cool what you're doing here, and you're probably gonna go to fucking Heaven or whatever, and that's fucking awesome, but I gotta be honest with you. This... This is... It's fucking disgusting. Uh... - Jim. - What? Before you leave, I, uh... I sketched you last night. From what I hear, it's more of a parting gift. - I don't want it. - I don't actually know what you look like naked. I just paint what I feel you look like naked. This is so not cool, Henry. Like, really not cool. - I liked him. - No, you didn't. Not for you to decide. And no more drawings. Not unless you've known someone for at least a year. That's like three people. Well, you're stuck drawing naked pictures of me, then. That's your punishment. Did somebody pee? I smell pee. Did someone pee on my jacket? Yeah, there it is. Gross. He called last night, too. Did you answer? It's okay if you did. I just want to know. I didn't. How long are you gonna screen him? So, what time today? You better figure I'll get a detention, so to be safe, 5:00? Maybe today you won't. We're running the mile. It'll be me and all the girls on their period trailing the rear. Okay, well, just try not to do anything stupid, just for this week. Uh, I don't want to see that principal again. - What will you give me? - My love. I already have it. - Good morning, Mr. Buckner, Jenn. - Hi. Griselda. Can I see Sofia for a minute? You're late for work again, Laura. You have five minutes. And don't say anything about her skin. Her skin? - Sandrine, that's for you. - Thank you. - Serg? - Hey. - Not again. - Please? - Can you watch her just for a minute? - Oh... Hey, beautiful. Yeah, just don't drop her in a pot. Put her under your shirt. - Keep her warm. - Oh, with the rest of them? Hey. And the school is amazing. They actually emphasize the arts. Uh, physical education isn't even a part of their curriculum, you know, which for Henry is very meaningful. I... I know it's a lot of money, but I could work it off while Henry goes to school. Yeah, it is very expensive, Laura. I know. I know. I wouldn't be asking if you weren't the only person I could ask. Oh, it's another RSVP for True's sweet 16. God, that makes 150. Is anyone not coming? I mean, you want all these things for your kids, and then you get them, there's another whole set of problems. You're looking at my skin, aren't you? Oh, there's just one little piece. No, no, no, the doctor said you have to let it all come off naturally. That's why the new skin looks so young and fragile. I know. Yeah, but there's just one little piece. Yeah, yeah, do I try and pick the animal hair off your sweaters? No, because there's too much. Ew, Mom, I literally can't look at you. That better heal before my party. No, no, it's practically healed now. Look. Sisters. You are disgusting. What? Did you book the white tiger? I was planning on it, and just as I was about to, I thought to myself, does a white tiger really want - to attend a sweet 16? - Yes. Because Kayla Drew had one at her party, and it was, like, amazing. Yeah, well, they are on... On the endangered species list. And just because one guy probably illegally has one that he rents out to parties... - Yes, you're going to book it, right? - Sure. Uh, although, you may be losing Henry and some other animal lovers as guests. I wasn't really planning on inviting Henry. It's just not really his crowd, you know? Besides, I saw him having lunch with a squirrel last week. They were talking and everything. It was really weird. I have to go get a mani-pedi. See you bitches later. With a squirrel, Laura. Oh... It's fine. Did she pick up? - She did not. - Surprise, surprise. Well, I'm afraid the decision is final, Jack. We can't have men of such low moral integrity bringing down the place. Oh, please. You geriatric sons of bitches know that this place is a total shit box. Uh, we may not have much, but we do have respect for the law. Oh, I'm afraid I find that quality very overrated. Then off you go. Be sure to send us a postcard from whatever jail cell you end up in. I think we should give Jack one more chance. Third time's a charm. I appreciate it. Perhaps we should all take a page out of Harriet's playbook. Oh, cut the bullshit, Jack. We tried to make it work, but you really shit the bed this time, Jack. Ms. Jaconi. Uh... This clearly was an accident. Henry would never intentionally slap anyone. Right, Henry? Well, I meant to slap Jeremy, but she dove in front of him like he was Obama. Henry, why slap? Boys really shouldn't be slapping. Slapping is a distant cousin to hair pulling. Well, I thought it would be better than scratching. Okay, well, that's hard to say, but the more important point here is, is Henry clearly would never hit a woman on purpose. All right? He's been raised by a single mom, for Christ's sakes. But he would hit a faculty member? I think that's been established. Could we start Henry's suspension next week? I have potentially a very hectic week. Henry is not suspended. He's expelled. Expelled? Why? For this. Henry requires more attention than we can provide. I gave you the list of specialty schools last month. I suggest you start making some phone calls. What am I doing wrong, Henry? - What? - Nothing. Well, I'm obviously doing something. You know, we can't afford a private school. Then I'll just drop out and take my GED. Not an option. You are graduating. - You didn't. - Well, and look at me. I didn't raise you to be like me. The whole point of kids is to make them better than you so they can support you later in life. - I thought we'd be roommates for life. - That's weird. I want a guest cottage in the back where you and your wife live. Or your husband. Jesus, I'm not gay. How many times do I have to tell you that? Ignore this. I want you to be happy. Would a specialty school make you happy? I don't know. - Would the other kids be weird like me? - Probably. Weirder, even. I think I'd like it. Yeah. I fucking hate Taylor Swift. Well, she actually writes her own songs. She's pretty cool, sweetie. But I see what you mean. Yeah. Hmm... Oh, you finally called me back. I need help. - With Henry. I need money. - How much? - A lot. - Well... I'm in trouble, too. Maybe you didn't think of that. You got kicked out of your home, didn't you? Yeah, all that bullshit about my side ventures not being up to their standards. Please! Anyways, uh... I've got to find somewhere to crash, or they'll put me in a state-run home with all the loony tunes. No, you can't, Dad. You can't stay here. I gotta look out for me and Henry. Uh, why don't I help you? You get me out of here, I get you the money. You have that kind of money? I could get it. Look, uh, I'm in a bit of a situation here, Laura. I don't know how to get out of this one. Well, I... I'm sure you'll figure something out. Anyways, I have until 10:00 tomorrow morning before they ship me off. I haven't given up yet. Hold on. I gotta take this, you guys. Stand by. Jojo here. Jojo, it's Laura. Laura! You'll never guess what I watched last night. Karate Kid. Remember when you used to call me Jojo-san, and I'd call you Laura-san? It's from Karate Kid. - It's a movie. - Listen to me, Jojo. Dad got kicked out of his home. He needs a place to stay. Oh, no. Papa-san. What did he do? Watch it! Hey, who knows? I have no idea. He fucked up again. But I... I'm picking him up, and I need him to stay with you. I don't know, Laura. Last time Dad stayed with me, the FBI followed me to work for a week. It was really intense. I would take him, but he is a horrible example for Henry. You gotta agree with me on that. Yeah, I do, I do. Does this mean I'll get to see you guys? No, I would put him on a plane. Laura, please come. Oh, It would be so fun. We could watch Karate Kid, you know? We could eat Captain Crunch. - Next time. - Hey, does Henry still take pictures of dead animals? No. No, he just draws people naked. Oh, that's sweet. Well, I hope he has enough energy to draw me. Oh, fuck! Oh... They haven't taken him yet, have they? Taken who? Jack Jaconi, my father. Oh, he should be out any minute. He said that you were coming for him. He said I was coming? Yeah, he said you'd be here at 10:00 on the dot. Of course, he did. You got played. What's the scowl for? You knew I was coming? I had a feeling. Uh, she's very moody, my daughter. Always has been. Hey, Hoight. Come with me. I want to say goodbye to my garden. I probably shouldn't leave my mom. - Of course, you should. - No. Excuse me. Please don't write that. Please don't... Give her a chance to stop that cop from writing her a ticket. Ten bucks. Ten bucks. I bet you can hardly believe, considering your mother can barely keep a piece of hair alive, that your grandfather's got a green thumb. I'm not really into gardening. Well, maybe what's in the shed will change your mind. I'm too old to molest, you know. Oh, Jesus Christ. You couldn't get molested with a bow in your hair. Even pedophiles know to steer clear of your bad vibes. Know what this is? Holy shit. This is not the shwag weed you cheapos smoke. No, sir. Uh, a French whore I once admired fed a bud to my cat, and she shit out one of the seeds. Oh, yeah, this is the good stuff. It came from a cat's ass? Well, yeah, had to. How else was I going to get it in the country? I don't know. Now, I need you to put this down your pants. Yeah? Can you do that for me? Why don't you put it down your pants? Because I am wearing adult diapers. Just stuff it in, you little chickenshit. Your mother's about to give me a real hard time for taking the Rolls-Royce, so I need something to get her voice out of my head. Absolutely not. It's all I got. Then you drive it. We had a deal. I get you to L.A., you get me the money. If you want to keep the car so bad, then you drive it. Yeah, those assholes over at DMV took my license away. I couldn't pass the eye exam. And I was hoping we could use some time together. Yes, we could. Twenty years ago. It's not happening, Dad. I got you the plane ticket already, so send the money when you land. Come on, Henry. I have set a boundary. It's set. It's a line in the sand. In the concrete, actually. I'm not driving that heap cross-country. You are not commandeering this trip already. You have done nothing to earn this. - And we're doing you a favor. - Well, I appreciate that, but I'd like to spend some time with you two. I hardly know Hoight. And I'd like to discover more things I like about you. Oh, God. Hey, look. Laura. I... I didn't want to tell you this, actually, but... Uh, the truth is... I haven't much time left. I'm... I'm dying, Laura. The doctor gave me the news a few days ago. My prostate cancer's come back. I'd be a goner on a plane. I've got a blood clot in my leg, and when we get to high elevation, it could... Go straight to my heart. That's where it's headed. This is a trick. This is another one of your schemes. I wish it was. So, why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to... Didn't want to worry you. I knew how busy you are. It doesn't matter. You should have told me. Well, I am, now. What do you say? How about spending some time together? You're dying? Sure as hell am. Really dying? Stage-four dying. I will be on my cell the whole time. And how many days? Like, two at the most. Three at the very, very most. What about the party? I'll be back to help with the deliveries. Just give me something good, like boils or meningitis. - Can that go away in two days? - Oh... - How often do I feed this one? - Every four hours. - 24/7? - Anything you want. Literally. My son. My good organs. I owe you my life. I want a date. I said anything you want. I want a date with you. No, I am a mess. I can't... I can't date people I like. It wouldn't be fair to them. Well, I won't do it. You want a date? - With me? With this? - Yes. Yes. I have faith that I haven't seen the best of you. Laura! Shit! Okay. Just give me something good. - Go. - Okay. Why did he only take five of them? It's a horror show back there. Well, these have more special needs than the others. Well, one need should be a new face.

Well, no, now I'm here in person. You can see how handsome I am, you know, so close up. Uh, tell Jed, uh, to show you his room, Laura. Okay. All right. But only just for a minute, because this was supposed to be a very quick trip. Oh, nonsense. I've got dinner on the stove, and the guest room sheets have barely been slept in. - Oh, wonderful. - Yeah, be there in a minute, Stan. Yeah, I'm on it, Sofia. Prada wallets for the gift bags. Done. Um, no, yes, boils are very contagious, but I think it's best that I work from home for a few days. No, don't be concerned about yourself. I'm sure it's just an ingrown hair. Okay, thanks. Bye. - Sorry. - A little more. A little more. Sorry, it's just my boss. Making the deals and mergers. I always knew you'd be a successful businesswoman. - I'm not a businesswoman. - No, she's an executive. Assistant. I'm an executive assistant. Yeah, well, "executive" is in it, yeah? This tastes like candy corn. Well, it should, because it's a candy corn casserole. - Really? - Hmm. Jed loves candy corn. Every bite has something sweet. I like candy corn, Jack. So do I, Jed. Not only on Halloween. It's been too long. What happened to that wonderful husband of yours? He left us. No. Well, he left me, actually, not Henry. - He left me, too. - Oh... Well, he has chronic fatigue, so basically he was too tired to love us properly. Well, I'd still like to string him up by his feet. We're all each other has got. And it just tickles me to death to see you and your father spending time together. He talks about you all the time. Yeah, mostly complaints. Family. That's all there is. Isn't that right, Jed? - Do you like me, Jack? - Sure do. - Are you my friend, Jack? - Sure am. Fuck yeah. I feel the same way. "Fuck yeah." Uh, thank you, Hoight. You're a man of your word. Now, where did you put the plant? What do you mean? I still have it down my pants. Oh, geez. I think it gave me a rash. I don't want to hear about your rash. Now, the point is, I can trust you, huh? Do you know why we're here? To visit Stanley and his son? That, and? I don't know. To annoy my mom? I'm a drug dealer, Hoight. I know I may look out of my prime, but I'm just getting started. There's $200,000 worth of weed in there. Go on, now. Take a look. We've been driving with this in the car? - That's real illegal. - Oh, you sound like your mother. I thought I could tell you things. She's gonna be really pissed. All my customers are lined up. I need a partner. I can't unload it on my own. Partner? What kind of partner? You help me get rid of the weed, and I'll send you money on your birthday. That's what normal grandpas do, anyway. Great. Then you'll be getting what you've always wanted. Would we all go to jail if we got caught, or just you? Just me, you little shit. I also wrote a note, just in case. "This weed is property of Jack Jaconi. Thank you for your time." You think it'll hold up in court? It should. All right. I'll help you. Well, Lindsay Lohan seems to be getting her act together, isn't she? - I'm pulling for her. - Yeah, me too, Jack. And Boy George is a Buddhist. I knew I liked him. Oh, my God, this kid, Macaulay Culkin. Oh, is he going through some shit. I'm tired. - Well, I guess this is good night. - Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure is. Well, good night. Night. You know... I don't want this to seem like an apology, but, uh, I shouldn't have complained about staying here. You know, Stanley is so nice, and Jed is great, and it's just nice to see them. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No problem. So, uh, so, here's to a super fun, but straightforward trip. I'm glad we're getting to spend some time together. And thank you for the money. Okay. Hey, are you going to sleep with Loretta? Why? Do you want to? Yeah. Why not? Well, yeah, listen. Yeah. I'm an asshole, Loretta. I really am. I don't deserve this. You're just like all the other girls. Huh? Your heart's too big. Uh, anyone care to join me in the Jacuzzi? No, thank you. No? Laura. No, thanks. Oh... All right, then. Good morning! Where is everyone? They went to Little Big Burger. But it's 7:00 a.m. Well, you can call them, put in your order, if you like. I'm sorry. I'm just nervous. There's no need to be nervous. Did you measure it out? I put it in a diaper bag. Yeah, good. Good. I'll, uh, take it from there. Your only job is to act like you don't give a shit. Can you do that? Jed, can you act cool? Uh, I'm cool. Take a lesson from Jed. Jesus. That was cool? Sorry. Scared of some Buddhist monks? I've had more capable partners in a game of charades. Goodbye, Jack. Uh... That's too much. Enjoy it, you sly dog. Arrivederci. - Arrivederci. - Bye. Hey. Hey! Stop at the next rest stop. I need to change my diaper. Okay, you don't have to say that. You can just say, "I have to use the restroom." - Hoight, hand me a diaper. - Just saying, you know? Asking for a diaper as opposed to asking for a restroom is a little candid. Some people might think that's rude. Well, I think they're rude. Judging a man by his diapers. I don't like the fact that I have to wear them.

What did you tell him about me? - I said that you were temporary. - Oh... Oh... That you are a temporary situation. Well, good. That's about right. Okay. Well, it's better - that he knows now. - Sure. So this way he will not be disappointed. - Sure. - Okay. Mom, what's wrong? I was just imagining what it would be like if you died. I was at a funeral, and there were a lot of people. I hate it when you do that. You were in a terrible head-on collision, and it was a closed casket. Enough. I know. I'm sorry. I can't help it. I just love you so much. Well, she's all right, your mother. She's doing her best. Was she always like this? Well, she's always had a thing about people who aren't worthy of her. Yeah. She can't help it. She... She likes an underdog. That's why she likes you so much. - Well, I don't know about that. - She does. She told me. She wants you to live with us and not with Jojo. She said that? Well, I am about to become her least favorite person for the 35th year running. What'd you do now? Well, you see all this? Your mom's not going to like to know who that's going to. I might need it to come from you. I don't know any of your customers. - Oh, you know one. - Who? Uh, your father. Yeah, he placed a pretty big order, and I can't afford to skip it. But I don't want to see my dad. Well, that's a little extreme. - What did he ever do to you? - He left us. Well, he's chronically fatigued. I mean, give the guy a break. - So, I've been thinking. - Yeah? Since we're gonna pass through Sausalito... No. You don't know what I'm gonna ask. - Okay, go ahead. - No. - You've already said no. - Good. I want to see him. It's been three years. Why? Are we not enough? Uh, don't bring me into this. Pretend you're a therapist right now. - Okay. Do you need closure? - Yes. No. Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. No. The truth is, I've been feeling like something's missing for a long time, and I don't know if he's the answer or not, but I have questions. I deserve to know why he left. You want to know why I have no friends? Because the guys in the locker room call me a bastard. You didn't tell me that. Not really. I didn't want to make you feel bad. But I think it explains a lot. Like why I'm not thriving at school like we all expected. Why I'm underweight. School wasn't a safe space for me, and, and now I'm left with questions. Questions only he can answer. - I didn't know you cared so much. - Of course I do. You know one of the qualities of my essence is sensitivity. No. Shit. Okay, we can stop. Okay. And I will be with you the whole time. ♪♪ There's something on my mind ♪♪ I gotta say, love ♪♪ So you know how I feel ♪♪ When I'm away, love ♪♪ I'm glad I knew you ♪♪ I'm glad I knew you ♪♪ I'm glad I knew you a while... ♪♪ - Are you okay with this? - You're asking me now? Well, I know how you get around him. It was humiliating for a father, seeing you run after him in high school. And those posters you made. - Oh, my God. - I was 17. - Yeah, couldn't take a hint, huh? - Jack Jaconi? Uh... Jesus Christ, man. I was sure you were dead. And I remember you being better-looking. Good thing we're both wrong. You remember your ex-wife? Yeah, sure. Sure I do. Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes. Hi, Leonard. Hey, kid. How old are you now? You do the math. He takes a little getting used to. Come on with me to the car. I've got about 14 more dogs there. You can give me a hand. How do you want to do this? Do you want me by your side, or do you want to talk to him alone? - I don't really care anymore. - What? I got the answer I needed. He's just a, he's just a douche. So, hey, what's your problem, kid? That supposed to be me? It's your soul. I mean, it was really small. Yeah, accurate. That's not nice. What? He's angry. And he has every right to be. I don't blame him, I guess, little shit. Come on, one more, for old time's sake. You... Mmm... You know, I'm real happy to see you and your old man get along so well. Yeah. I'm working on letting it go. - In with the good, out with the bad. - Right. Yeah, so he wasn't there ever. - Who needs someone around all the time? - Right. So he... He never drove carpool. So he bought my first car with the money he got beating a Belgian casino. - That's pretty cool, isn't it? - You're a wise woman. I'm not trying to change anyone, you know? An elephant will always be an elephant. - He will never be a monkey. - A monkey. Yes, I learned that from you. You look lonely. Yeah, I am. Hey, Kirkie. I thought you could use some more product. Uh, no, no, I'm leaving the business. Looking for something more family-oriented. Marijuana's about to be legal anyway, so it's lost its fun. Just want to get rid of it, that's all. No, no, no, everything, everything's fine. Well... Oh, just want to give you the best deal of your life. What are you doing? Oh, nothing, nothing. Go to sleep. Go back to sleep. I miss this. Like waking up in a jigsaw puzzle. I can't move my leg. Well, I wouldn't... Yeah, I wouldn't. That brown one looks like he's comfortable. You save all these guys? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Some things never change, huh? You're gonna save me one of these days. Do you have any spare cash? I need to send Henry to a special school. What's wrong with him? He's gay, or socially awkward, or brilliant. Maybe all three. Things are kind of tight around here. Wait, what about Sofia? You still working for her? - Can't you ask her? - No, I did. Working for her is really complicating our friendship. What friendship? She always treated you like shit. She isn't all that bad. I just wish I didn't have to go back and work for her. Well, we all gotta work, honey. What do you do? - What do I do? - Mm-hmm. I do a little of this. A little of this. A lot of this. Leonard. Leonard. Leonard, come on. I'm serious. I'm serious. - Okay? Our kid needs help. - Well, we all need help, honey. Look, in fact... I was kind of hoping that I might be able to borrow some cash from you. - I'm thinking of going to Venezuela. - Okay. - And then... - Do you care about Henry at all? Well, sure I do, but you know me. I... I'm not good at that kind of stuff. You're not good at what stuff? Loving your son? Taking care of him? Being responsible? Yeah. Yeah, but you know what? You're good at that, and so the good news is, you know, we balance each other out. - Fuck. - What? What? - I'm so fucked up. - No, no, no. Come on. No, honey, come on. Hey, hey, hey. - No, no. Come on. - No. - Stay here. Come on. - No. Ew, ew. - Stay here. - I'm so fucked up! I can't even tell my therapist everything. That's how fucked up I am. So fucked up. You know what? I think you might be my father. You even wear the same deodorant. Right, well, you know what? I'm not your father. Your father's me. Oh, God. I was messed up when I met you, and 18 years later, I still haven't learned anything. I am literally going backwards. You know, you don't give yourself enough credit, Laura. You're smarter than you think. You do a lot of smart shit. Like what? Like divorcing me. That's big. You know what? You know, a lot of women, they get all wrapped up in all this, but you bailed at exactly the right time. I mean, it wasn't gonna get any better. - It wasn't? - Mm, it wasn't. I mean, all them promises, they were bullshit, you know? I wasn't gonna change, and I still aren't. - So what are you saying? - I'm saying exactly what I'm saying. - You are, aren't you? - Yeah. I mean, I tell Misty that all the time. Please tell me Misty is your cat. You want me to tell you Misty's my cat? - Who is she? - My cat. - She's your wife, isn't she? - She is. - Jesus! Fuck! - Come on, I didn't tell you 'cause I knew you'd freak out like this. Okay, you know what? Okay. So, what, and you tricked me into sleeping with you? Well, I didn't have to do much. You know what? You are a lousy father, and you're a lousy ex, and we both deserve better. Good for you! Hey, Laura! Good for you, honey! You're a lot tougher than you think. Hey, Laura? Laura? Hey. He's married, and I still want to be with him. It's disgusting. He might as well be you. I chose the worst possible father for my son, the worst possible man for me. Eighty percent of the time, I feel like total shit. Well, 20% is a pretty good amount of time to feel decent. Just tell me it's gonna be okay. Can you tell me that? I don't know what it's going to be like, but I might have a plan. It's knee-jerk, but it might work. What should I do? Well, just keep doing what you're doing, but, uh, don't take any more bullshit. - You mean no more dogs? - No. I mean no more lying sons of bitches like Leonard. Hoight, get your things. We're leaving. Come here, Leonard. What... What's the matter, Jack? Now, I'm not the type of man who throws a sucker punch, so this is your warning. I'm going to hit you now. Now, you listen good, 'cause I'm only going to say this once. You stay away from my daughter and my grandson. You hear me? If you mess with them one more time, I'll make sure it's your last. Jesus Christ, Jack. I thought you were a Buddhist. Oh, I am. But you bring out the right-wing Christian in me. Hey! Hey. You, you really think I give a shit? Your whole family's crazy. I mean, whoever heard of a family drug deal, anyway? How much pot you have back there, Jack? Oh, you mean you don't know? Well... Well, look in the trunk, sweetheart. You're a drug mule. At least I never dragged her into any of my scores, Jack. - What's he talking about? - Nothing. Open the trunk. - Do you promise not to be mad? - Open it. Yeah, there's nothing in there, Henry. He's just trying to stir up trouble. That's all. Don't open it. - Don't you trust us, Mom? - Open the trunk! Yeah, come on. I couldn't let you throw out good product. Is she dying? No, she's not dying. Let me work on her for a second. - Don't. - Look, I know how much you must hate me right now, but, but I don't think you're capable of turning your father in. You don't know me at all. I do, and I don't think you would do that. I am a mother. I could be arrested. Uh, Henry could be arrested. No one is going to be arrested. You... You don't know that. We don't all have your luck. I was trying to help the kid. You told me you needed help. And this was your solution? Trafficking drugs across the country? You know what? I don't know why I bother. I mean, you just... You just can't... You can't live without being a victim, can you? Huh? You'd rather suffer than see the good in a situation. Well, I nearly got enough for Henry's education. I'm not paying for Henry's school with drug money! Oh, yeah, punish the kid. That's smart. Oh, don't you dare turn this around on me. I am mad! I'm the one that's mad. You disappointed me. Again! Again? I didn't know you were counting. How many times is it? My entire childhood. One disappointment after the next. You never came through. Dad, you never came through. Not once. Well, you're living, you're breathing. I sure as hell didn't kill you. Oh, thank you so much for supplying the basics, Dad. Thank you. The food and the water were brilliant. - Thank you! - Now you're being dramatic. You... You don't have a clue, do you? How much time I spent waiting for you to show up. Disappearing for weeks on end, never being reachable when I was getting my heart broken. Leaving me alone to take care of Jojo in that shitty apartment. I spent my entire childhood scared. Why weren't you there? I needed you, Dad. Did you hear what I said? I said I needed you. I'm sorry you were scared. Please tell me that you are dying. You didn't lie about that, did you? At least, please, please, tell me that that's true. We're all dying, really. I'm done. I'm done. I am so done! You can drive your own drugs around from now on. Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - You know what? And find your own ride to L.A. because we are done. You're really acting crazy. It's you that's going to get us arrested. You know, and you are selfish. You are absolutely incapable of putting anyone else before yourself. Maybe you could be happier if you did the same. I mean, you wouldn't be so goddamn miserable all the time. - Grandpa. - No. Stay out of this, Hoight. Your mother has lost all rational thought. Don't tell me how to feel. You don't get to tell me anything anymore. I am angry, and I'm not burying any more shit for your sake. - Mom. Mom. - Henry, it's fine! There's a cop coming. Jesus Christ. Pick up the weed! - All right. - Pick it up! - All right, now, stay cool. - Pick up all the weed! - Pick it up. - Stay cool. - Jesus. Hurry. - Don't go wild on me. - Move slow. - Henry, put it in. - Put it in the truck. Henry! - Move slow. Just... Okay, Dad, get in the car. That's too slow. Get in the car! All right, all right. Okay. Close the trunk! - Stuff this down your pants. - I don't have any room. - Stop throwing it around. - Hey. This, too. Smells like a Grateful Dead concert in here. Hello. License and registration. Sure. Is there anything wrong, Officer? You want to tell me what you were doing outside your vehicle? Oh, right, the diapers. My father's diapers flew out the window, and we pulled over to pick it up. He has cancer. My father has cancer. Very bad cancer. - All these animals belong to you? - Yes. Is that your son in the back, laughing? That is my son, but I believe he's crying. - Shit. - This is the number of my lawyer. Shit, shit! - Let him know where they send me. - I'll go with you. - No. No, no, no, no. - I'm your partner. You shut your mouth. You knew nothing. If you stick to that story, you'll be fine. What about me? - Laura Jaconi? - Yes. Please, step out of the vehicle. Is there something wrong, Officer? Please step out of the vehicle. Uh, uh-uh, hold on, hold on. Uh, before you take her in, let me explain. Uh... This is all a misunderstanding. Really? You can explain her unpaid parking tickets? Parking tickets? Over $3,000 worth. Well, that can't be explained. She's a criminal. Lock her up. Ah-ha. There she is. The law breaker. I'm enjoying this, Laura. Uh, how is Sausalito going to go to sleep at night knowing that a cold-blooded criminal, such as yourself, is back on the streets? So I got behind a few tickets. - So what? - Behind? You haven't paid one since 1983. What did you suppose was going to happen? Stop it, Dad. I'm not in the mood. Look... Tell me the truth. Did you get a rush? ♪♪ I can live ♪♪ I can smile ♪♪ Hold my head way up high ♪♪ Baby, it's all ♪♪ All because of you ♪♪ Yeah ♪♪ I've got a new song ♪♪ I can sing ♪♪ Seems like my whole world has been changed ♪♪ Baby, it's all ♪♪ All because of you ♪♪ Oh, baby, it's all ♪♪ All ♪♪ This is the last stop, Dad.

Keep an eye on your mother for me, will you? You're being a real C-U-Next-Tuesday. He's never gonna want to live with us now. He was never gonna live with us, Henry. Shit. I gotta take this. Hi. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. One thing at a time, Sofia. Jack, it's so good to see you, my friend. Oh, my goodness. - Come on in. Come on in. - You bet. You know, I'll open a bottle of Macallan 25. Oh, boy. I've been saving it for somebody worthy. Well, you better put it in a to-go cup. My daughter is pouting in the car. Why, she doesn't want to come in? She's taking some kind of stand. I don't know what I've done. I probably tried to help her, I guess. Well, my... My daughter Jennie hasn't spoken to me since I forgot to thank her at the Globes in '93. She was nine, Jack. Holy moly. - Well, straight to business, then. - To business. Yeah, you bet. And here is the moolah. - How you doing, Jack? - I don't know. Maybe it's time to retire. Nope, word's not allowed in the house. Especially about Jack Jaconi. Well, I've been thinking about it. Spending some time with my family. They're awful, but they can't help it. Her party won't be a disaster, Sofia. I promise. I... Please calm down, please. Look, I'm asking you as a friend. I mean, give me the benefit of the doubt. Just give me a few days to figure it out. True's party's gonna be perfect. I promise. No. I know. Well, I'm sorry I let you down. I... No, I don't expect you to loan me the money for it. I... I... I know. Do you want them to call the cops? Turn the fucking music down. Hey, if anything goes wrong, start shooting. Hurry up. - Do you think they're after Grandpa? - I don't know. - Should we call the cops? - No, we can't call the cops. What if they kill him? Oh. I've been meaning to tell this to you. I think that you are a decent guy. I think you have a good heart. Sometimes bad guys need to hear that. - The masseuse. - Huh? The masseuse. Sure you don't want to stay? She'll rub everything but your cock. Since when does Joey Carlisle need to pay a woman to touch him? Since my pubes turned white. Okay. Surprise, motherfucker. Hands up. Turn around. Turn around. Hands up. Hurry the fuck up. Hands up! Hands up! Jesus Christ. Go! Against the wall. Go. ♪♪ Nailed a nose before... Where's our money?

I think we'd better get out of here, 'cause I'm pretty sure they were cartel. - Oh, cartel, yeah. - Cartel cartel? - Yeah. Cartel, yeah. - And they were afraid of me? Well, you came in here like a freaking maniac with that bow and arrow. Even I was scared of you. Oh, no. No. Please. Hang on a minute. Yeah, Sofia, this, this isn't really a good time. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? There isn't gonna be a white tiger, okay? Yeah, I didn't book it. You know why?

We're not friends. No, we're not. We... We haven't been friends since you made me return your stripper gear to every Buffalo Exchange in Seattle, so... Fuck off, former friend! Hello! Dad. How was the drive? Well, your sister scared away some cartel members and saved my life. Whoa. Way to go, Laura-san. Guess how much I paid for this painting. You're right. It was free. My friends found it in the dog park in a dumpster, and they were like, "Jojo will want this." And then they presented it to me, and I was like, "Heck, yeah, I do." Who wouldn't want a totally touching oil painting of a mother dog helping her pup cross a stream? A lot of people. Well, whoever threw it away, yeah. Well... This is not the Waldorf Astoria. Okay, Dad, let me give you a tour before you judge your new home. Hmm? - Yeah. - Okay, so... Excuse me. Over here, this is where I do my Pilates about once a week. And this is where I have my coffee. Delish. Oh, this is my amazing roommate, Fritz, who also sells marijuana, so the two of you will have a lot to chat about. - Papa-san. - No. And this is what has now become the family bed. Who would have thought the four of us, with four dogs, together in a family bed? Does it get any better? - I sure hope so. - Dad, come on. You're about to take up half of her 400 square feet. She's trying to look on the bright side. Well, I'm not seeing it. Laura, I think I might know what would cheer Dad up. - No. - Yes, and yes, and yes. - No. - And yes. Okay, okay, okay. All right, Dad. Remember that night you lost $60,000 on a bad Super Bowl bet and we did a performance to take away the sting a little? - It didn't. - Well, even though back then it was appropriate to perform the dance - in our underwear... - It wasn't. Well, tonight, we are fully clothed. Ready, Fritz? Ready? Lights.

I'm just a regular 35-year-old woman. I'm going to my room. Excuse me. Can we get something to eat? - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. Doesn't feel like nothing. Well, you drive me across the entire country just to get rid of me. Is that what you think? We're getting rid of you? Well, you might as well check me back into another home. You wanted to be there. You chose that place. It was my only option. - It wasn't your only option. - I'm hungry. You could have made the tiniest effort. You could have stayed with us. You could have given me one tiny rule. That's literally the only thing I can do to protect myself. - From what? From whom? - I'm really hungry. - From you. - Oh, so now I'm a serial killer? No, you're just the one who can hurt me the most. I'm really fucking hungry! Seriously, guys, figure it out already. I need to eat. - Ready to order? - Oh. Yeah, we'll have one of everything. Everything? Yeah, one order of every dish on the menu. The kid needs to eat. One order, mixed vegetables! "When troubles come, they come not single spies, but in battalions." Oh, my gosh. Don't get too excited. What a lazy Susan this one is. Was there lobster on the menu? He's gone. I know. He took the car. He left you this. Oh... What's wrong? What's wrong? Sister-san, come here. Come on. Don't, don't, don't cry. I always knew he wasn't gonna stay. I just thought I'd get to see you and Henry. This would be so much easier if he was an asshole. Oh, you know what? He is. Feels just as shitty as when we were kids. Well, think of how it feels for him. Here he has two great kids, super successful, amazing, brilliant dancers. And yet he chooses to spend time with other people's kids. - Who are other people's kids? - Everybody else. - What'd he give you? - $20,000 worth of marijuana. And Blind Poodle. How about you? It's money for Henry's school. Shit, what am I gonna tell Henry? I already know. We're in a studio apartment. Are you okay? I guess I just realized why you love animals so much. It's gonna be okay, Laura. You're a survivor, like all those animals you save. How'd you end up being the sane one? Guess I've just always seen Dad for who he really is. Someone we love? Yeah, only slightly better than our worst ex-boyfriend. That is so sad. We'll never be more interesting than Dad's adventures. I always used to think that if I could be like Debbie Gibson or Tiffany or Robert Smith of The Cure, then maybe... Yes. But it's a no-go, so...

Oh, yeah, we found ourselves a routine. Eat, sleep, poop, repeat. Well, thank you. Uh, I was thinking I could... You know, I could hang onto her for a few more days, let you get some rest.
