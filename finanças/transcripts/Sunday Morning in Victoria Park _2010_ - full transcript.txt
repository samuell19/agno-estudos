My dad called. My neighbor just got back home. She was abused by her employer in Malaysia. Now she can't walk and half of her face is ruined. It makes my dad worry that I will experience the same thing. So? They want you to come home? Of course. But I don't want to. Yi. Aren't you afraid that you will get tortured by your employer too? If I was scared, why would I be here? But, if my dad insists that I have to go home... you will have to continue and build my dream. Okay? Become a migrant worker, are you sure that's your dream? Is it because they call it "The hero of state foreign exchange." And you expect the government to appreciate you? My dream is, when I die... I want to die after doing something valuable for other people. That's my dream. All right. Come on. Let's eat. Dinner. SUNDAY MORNING IN VICTORIA PARK - Sekar. - Sir. Come on. What do you want, sir? Sekar, I know your problem, but that's not the answer for it. - You don't know anything, Gandi! - Listen to me first. Come on. I can help you. You're late! Don't come and look for me again. Beside, you're nobody to me! I should've known that a long time ago. I'm going back to work now. Sekar! Hello, morning. Hey, Saejun. Stop! Don't run. Don't run. Stop! Don't run. Saejun. Mayang! Mayang! Mayang! Mayang! Hey, watch out for the traffic light! It's dangerous. I'm so sorry. Mayang. Be careful. Don't do this anymore. You too. Don't do this next time. Let's go. Bye-bye, Saejun. Bye-bye. You got here late? Didn't you leave on time? - Yes. I had to meet someone first. - Are you going back to the store now? Nope. I'm going home. Saejun is very naughty, mischievous. But he's cute. He's just a kid. That's better than Waiwai. He never talks. You said you were going home. Mayang. What happened? Sir, I thought you were at work. I'm not feeling very well today, so I came home early. Okay, okay. Get me a cup of tea. Okay. What are you doing? You can't afford a new pair of shoes? - Can you just be quiet? - Don't get mad. Come on now. These are not good shoes anyway. Do you need a job? Someone needs a nanny for an old man. To accompany him on walks every morning and afternoon. Interested? - An old man or a dog? - I'm serious. If you're not interested, I will ask someone else. You want? - How much percent do you want? - What do you mean? I know you need the money, to pay for your boyfriend. - You're wrong. - Yati? - Speak of the devil. Insane. - Yati! I'm here, Honey. - What are you doing here? - Offering her a job. She needs money too. - Let's go. You have to go home. - Yes. I'm going now, Sekar. Think about my offer, okay? - Do you have fried Tempeh? - I want to pay. DESI, 10 AM IN VICTORIA PARK. DON'T FORGET! TUTI, WHEN YOU'RE FREE, PLEASE TEXT ME. URGENT! GANDI. One black beef soup with rice, please. Hey, Tuti. You've got a message. - From who? - Gandi. It must be about Sekar. Mayang! Mayang! - Mayang! - Hey. Mayang! Mayang! Saejun, weren't you sleeping? I told you not to fight with others. Even if they tease you. You are too thin and short. You can't win against others. I'm just fighting with a girl. And you always tell lies with Mayang! Madam, it's my fault. I didn't keep an eye on him. I'm so sorry, Mayang. Why are you so naughty? Babe, you will take me home, right? Here you go. Thank you. What do you think? They're nice. - How much? - 350 HKD. Hi. Are you sleeping already? What do you want late at night like this? The information you gave me about that club last time. You said I should only accompany them to drink. You didn't tell me they would also take me to a hotel. If you don't want to, you can say no. Beside, we only keep them company while they're spending their money. At least that's what I heard. Did you go to the hotel with the guest? But I didn't get a lot of money. So what do you want? If you want to get a lot of money, you have to be willing to do anything. Bye. The only person who knew that I would be at the club was you. - So how did Gandi know I was there? - I'm sorry, Sekar. He kept asking about you so maybe that was a slip of my tongue. Silly you! Beside, I thought you wouldn't go that far to get the money. And I didn't think Gandi would go to the club to find you. - How was I suppose to know? - What do you mean? Good thing that I didn't tell you where I live! So much for a friendship! Sekar. Gandi did that because he cares. We all care. Promise? Why do you always look up there? You wouldn't understand. Let's go. - Dad! - We're going home! You have to leave this place! - Dad! - Sir! Hold on, Sir! - Come on! - Hold on, Sir. Listen to me first. Yayi. Tomorrow you have to go and become a migrant worker. We got the summons letter already. - But I never applied. - I applied for you! You have to go to Hong Kong and find your sister! Before all these goats die! Hey! You! Remember to pay the rent. What are you doing? Why don't you speak? I'm talking to you. - Where's your boyfriend? - At work. - He has a job now? - That's what he said. What about your boyfriend? You've been here for a while. You should find a boyfriend. Don't just work for money. Do you think men would be attracted to us? What do you mean? Do you think a man would be attracted to migrant workers like us? A maid? First, Amar is my third boyfriend here. Of course we can get a boyfriend. Second, there is nothing wrong with us. Are you ashamed of being a migrant worker? A maid. Whatever. Are you ashamed? Do you think it's a dirty job? Indecent? Do you know the term "Foreign exchange hero"? What "Foreign exchange hero"? That's just the term they use to address us. People enjoy calling us names. As if they know everything about us. They're boasting about us. But still, we don't have anything. They're taking the money that we give to the country. Through the foreign exchange, that I said earlier. Talking to me about this is pointless. Say it to the people who can only boast about us, like you just said. At least I'm saying it to you now. I'm trying to convince you. Your job is just as good as any other job. Waiwai. Hey, Saejun! This simple chat is now getting serious. So what do you think? About looking for a boyfriend. - I'm looking for something else. - Looking for what? What do you mean something else? Something else what? What you said just now. - Which one? - Never mind. Come on. You are three days late. So for this month, you have to pay the installment plus three days fine. The total amount is $1,500. The minimum wage that will be applied, after July 2008 is 3,580 Hong Kong dollars. It's around four to five million in Indonesian. The payment method is with check, cash or transfer to your bank account. Mom, nasi goreng. I've got to go. -Hi, Gandi -Hi, Sar. Gandi, have you met Mayang? No. Is she new here? I've been here for three months, and it's only my second time in this shop. Oh, right. I'm Gandi. Mayang. Gandi, I have to go over here first. Gandi, last night Sekar came to see me again. Really? Have you found out where she is living now? Sari. - Who is Gandi actually? - Gandi? You can say that he's the father of the Indonesian workers in Hong Kong. He organizes many events such as entertainment, or even something more serious. Like counseling. He works at the consulate. But since he hangs out in Warung Bude, he became close to us. He listens to our stories. We're really close. He used to have a wife. But then they separated. I think she got jealous of female Indonesian workers who are close to Gandi. And who is Sekar? The name that they mentioned? Oh, Sekar? She's also an Indonesian worker here. But she's been missing for almost a year. From what I heard, she's in debt. Her work contract has ended, but she can't leave Hong Kong either. The place she borrowed the money from got her passport number. So it can be said that she's on the alert list. She can't leave Hong Kong. There's conflicting information going around about her. That can be a lesson for you. You're still new here. Don't get easily tempted by the luxury. Beside, the rule is we don't get a salary for the first seven months. What's the matter? When will you go back home? I'm so nervous. - Why are you nervous? - This is my first time going back home. From what I heard, the situation at the airport is pretty scary. A migrant worker like her would be easy prey in the bus terminal Papat. That's why I transferred all the money to my family. And I don't bring a lot of money with me. That's good. That's what we usually do. We all do that too. What else do I need to know? - The most important thing is... - Hold on. Listen to this. At the airport, you will see a huge sign. Read it. If it says "DELAYED", it means your flight is delayed. If it says "CANCELED", it means you can't go home. You have to come back here. - Her English is great. - Yeah. Turns out your English is amazing. Of course. With this style, if I don't speak English, that would be a shame. I look like Christina Aguilera, don't I? Hi, Tuti! Hey, Sari. Where are you going? Who is this? He's handsome. Excuse me, I have to go home now. Be careful. Bye, Sari. That's her boyfriend. They usually go to get a room. Enjoy your meal. Hey, Mey will be coming in to work tomorrow. You're not needed anymore. - But, boss... - And it's too dangerous if I employ you here. This restaurant could be shut down if they found out. Keep working. Keep working! If you don't pay your rent immediately, then you can get out of my place! Go away. We can't hire you. It's illegal. Go away. Don't bother my business. I'd like to send money to Indonesia, 3,000 Hong Kong dollars. Using Fire Cash, so they can cash the money using an ID card and a PIN number. I need your ID card and the recipient's name. This is the transfer receipt and the PIN to cash the money in Indonesia. Please sign here. - Can they take the money out now? - Yes. Whatever. Gandi. - What's up, Mayang? - May I talk to you for a minute? - Of course. Talk about what? - But not here. Okay. Come on. So, Sekar is your little sister? I work here so I can find Sekar. Yeah. What have you done while working here for three months? Let's talk here. I went to the apartment where she used to work, many times. I went there hoping to see her. But I never met her. Yeah. Does Sari knows about this? I only talk about this to you now. Sari said you're like a father to the Indonesian workers here. So I thought you would know Sekar. Everybody knows Sekar. And everybody is looking for her. Is she that important? I don't understand what you mean. I've got to go. Mayang! Do you have a cellphone? Ask Sari to take you to buy a cellphone. And then put the card in. That way, we can keep in touch. In the meantime, my friends and I here will keep looking for Sekar. Gandi, my friends don't need to know that I'm Sekar's sister. Why? - I've got to go. - Mayang. Mayang! Mayang! If you trust me, you will have to trust my kids too! - I don't want to talk about it anymore! - Whatever! I'm tired of this! I don't want to be disturbed. You always fight. Who cares. Smoke? Ti. Yati. The job you offered me, to babysit an old man. Is it still available? Damn you. You see I'm troubled like this, but you're still asking about the job? But you're like this everyday. You fight. You make up. You fight. You make up. Fight again! I'm sick of that. Come on, Ti. Fine. Tomorrow we'll go there. - That's better. - Stop smiling. Thanks, Ti. - You look terrible when you fight. - You look bad too. Hey! Don't go that way. Jump up there. Let's jump up there. Good idea. It's good for children. Did you fight with anyone today? Good boy. Keep going. Keep being a good boy. We will take you out more often to play. Mayang, let's eat together. Bon appetit. What do you want to eat? I'll get it for you. Give him more vegetables. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Hey. What kind of cellphone do you want? Gandi told you about that? Come on, get in. What? There's something I need to talk to you about. We'll go over there. My sister? - Mayang? - Yes. She's looking for you. You want to read this? Mayang? - Is she here? - Yes. She's looking for you. That's strange. Why? What's so strange about a big sister looking for her little sister? If it's Mayang, then it's strange. Saejun! Why did you fight? If your mom finds out she will scold you! After scolding you, she will scold me! Don't you know that? How many times do I have to tell you? He won't understand any word of that. You speak better Cantonese. You tell him! Mayang said that you can't fight with others or you will be scolded by your mum. They bully me just because I'm shorter than them. I hate them! He's upset. He's smaller than the others, so his friends look down on him. That's the problem. Tell Saejun, there's no point being mad at people who underestimate us. He has to learn to accept his shortfalls. He has to learn that from now. Or he will grow up to bitter, and that's not fun! Mayang says you need to accept the reality. Anger doesn't help. If you can't accept the reality, you will be unhappy for the rest of your life. Let's go. - Do you have medicated oil here? - There. Thank you so much. 12 HKD, please. Thank you. My Cantonese is not very good. We met before, didn't we? - Are you from Indonesia? - You can't tell that? - Where did we meet? - At Warung Bude. - Did we talk? - No, we just passed each other. You don't remember? I work here. Where are you actually going? - I'm on my way home. - Is it near here? Not really. Then why did you go this way? I'm going inside now. May I know your name? My name is Vincent. Mayang. People often talk about you in Warung Bude. You're Sekar's sister, aren't you? Is it necessary for everybody to know? My friends, Vincent. - Vincent? - Whoever he is. Is it really necessary? The question is how important it is for you to find Sekar. - But it doesn't have to... - Listen to me. Before you came here and even if you don't come here, we will still be looking for Sekar to help her. But I told you, nobody needs to know that I'm her sister! Mayang, if she knows her sister is looking for her, it will lure her out. You don't know how it is between Sekar and I. With your attitude like this? I know how it is. Mayang, let's go to Warung Bude. No. I have to pick up my boss's son. Mayang, you still want to see Sekar, right? Am I right? You can't keep behaving like this. You're upset, confused. You have to stay calm, Mayang. Stay calm. Mayang. Mayang. Gandi, do you want to know the truth? I'm not even sure if I want Sekar to come home or not. Yes. I've given it to you. I have already given it to you. Yes. It's even harder to ship this stuff now. I'll see if they still have it in stock. Let's talk later, my friend is here. Let me know when it arrives. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. It's been years since you came here. Yes. So you've met Sekar's sister? - You mean Mayang? - Yes. Mayang. It wasn't intentional though. Beside, I don't have any bad intentions with her anyway. I didn't say you have. I never have negative thoughts about you. It's you who thinks bad of me. I did, yes. But not too often, right? Let's eat. Come on. Vincent. He used to be Gandi's best friend. Even though their occupations are totally different. Vincent is a merchant. He purchases items here and sells them in Indonesia. Sekar borrowed money from Gandi and Gandi denied it. She disappeared ever since. "You boast about being the one who cares for all Indonesian workers." "But when someone needs your help, you refuse to help." That's what Vincent said when he argued with Gandi in Warung. I was there. All this happened, more or less. It's all because of Sekar. What do you mean? You don't like your own sister? Mayang! Mayang! Mayang! Mayang! Where is that kid? Mayang! My child. It's almost dark. Let's go home. Your friends are home already. Come on. Okay? - Is Dad home already? - Yes. I guess I will go home later then. When dad is sleeping. - Paint it well. Do not miss any spots. - Yes. Dad, I'm going to work now. -I'm going, Mom -Yes. Take care. Working for years in that farm, but what do you get? Look at Sekar. After only a few months working, she could pay to renovate my house. I could buy a refrigerator, buy a scooter in installments and have a goat farm. - Right? - Yes. I don't want to see you fighting again. That should be alright now. Okay, Mayang. Thank you. Hello? Yes, this is Mayang. Vincent? Vincent... How do you know my number? - Catch this. - You've made a mess here. I know how to fold a plane too. I use the simplest method. Madam, Sir. Can I go out today? Sure, but don't come back too late. It's dangerous for a girl to stay outside at night in Hong Kong. Not to mention that you are still unfamiliar with the environment, you know? I understand. Thank you, Madam. Thank you, Sir. My paper plane flies really far. Hi, Mayang. Now everybody knows my number. Okay. I apologize. I'm sorry if what I know can upset you. So you want to meet me just to say that? - Of course not. I'd like to talk to you. - Talk about what? To talk about Sekar. I want to help you to find you sister. And I've talked a lot with Gandi. And then what? Gandi wants to make amends for his guilt? Or maybe you feel guilty too! You two argue and fight while Sekar's life is getting more uncertain! I guess you have heard a lot. People here enjoy messing with someone else's business. I don't get it! But it's not as bad as you think, Mayang. We are in a foreign country now. And what is most important for us is our fellow Indonesians. Why didn't you help Sekar at that time? Why did you blame Gandi instead? Fine. I've got to go now. What do you want now? - I want to go home too. - But this is not the way to your house. Sekar never contacts me. And she never tells me anything. I heard the news about her from someone else. So it's not that I didn't want to help her. If she came to you to borrow some money, would you help her? I don't know. Since I was a kid, I was always taught... that if I wanted something, I have to work hard to get it, fight for it. Instead of borrow from someone else. Here's the place I hang out with friends. Enough, okay? We don't need to fight again. Don't sulk again. Look. That's Agus with her new girlfriend. - But you won't stop nagging me. - Well, I'm a man. - Just go and confront them. - Come on. Hurry up. - Should I go there? - Yes. -You wait here -Okay. It will be exciting. - Smile now. - But you keep nagging. - Agus. - What? You still dare to show your face here. Do you have money now? Is that why you're taking your girlfriend out? You have a job now? - Watch what you're saying. - Don't just keep quiet you! Gus! Don't just stay quiet! When will you pay your debt? You have too much debt already. Pay your debt. Gus! - Talk to me. - Let's go. Just ignore this jealous girl. Who are you calling jealous? You just don't know that jerk, Agus. You just watch me, Agus. If you come again I will make you regret it! You can't do that! What's the matter? - Agus hasn't paid her debt. - That's Tuti. We met her at Warung Bude. She used to work in the same apartment with Sekar. - Tuti. - Hi, Sari. How are you? - What's the problem? - Love problems, you know. Come on. Don't get upset. Tuti, this is Mayang. - Mayang. - This is Tuti. Let's eat together. Maybe she entertains the guests at the bar to get some money. - Sekar? - Yes. Bar? What bar? A bar, quite far from here. She got the information about that bar from me. I heard about that bar by coincidence. But I didn't know Sekar would do that. You can ask Gandi if you don't believe me. Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get her in trouble. Where's that bar? You can't go there alone. It's dangerous. People might misunderstand you. You want to go there with me? I'm too scared to do that. What about you Tuti? Don't look at me. You better ask Gandi to go with you. Menuk. I can't. I'm busy. I can do that. But why doesn't Mayang ask me herself? I don't know. Come on, Mayang. Talk. So, when do you want to go there? Your remaining debt is now $15,700. Ever since I first met Sekar, I've never seen her at the same bar. So don't get disappointed if you don't see her there, okay? I know. Gandi, why is he here? I asked him to join us. For our safety. If you see Sekar, what are you going to do? I will take her with me. That will end all the problems. I'm tired of this. Gandi, let's just go home. I don't think Sekar will be here. That's Sekar. No. That's not her. -That's Sekar, Mayang -Gandi. That's Sekar. Sekar. Where are you going? Sekar! Gandi will be back soon. I failed. Mom. How are you? Not yet. Be patient, Mom. Mom, don't cry. We can't let it happen. We all have to help Sekar. I wanted to just confront the Super Credit. But that's impossible, because they're a legal institution. I'm sure many of us have had problems with Super Credit too. Anybody want to share? So we can solve the problem together. Yes. You. It was three years ago. I had to sell the rice field that I gave to my dad to pay the debt. - Anyone else? - Me. Me too. I wanted to go back to my hometown. But since they got my passport number, I'm too scared to go back home. So I just took any job to make money. Anyone else? If not, I will continue. I have debt with Super Credit. Up to now, I still do. Is it a lot? I never payed them, not once. Yati, you know the interest rate they apply is huge. The longer you delay to pay, the more the debt you have. You gave the money to Agus, didn't you? Enough. Yati, everything I told you about Agus, it's for your own good. It's not that I can't stand to see you and Agus dating. But, it's because I know Agus. She will only make you suffer. You got that? Yati. Don't put off paying your loan for too long. We don't want this problem to get protracted like what happened to Sekar. Who called? Why don't you pick up the phone? Is your boyfriend calling? - Hello. - A client is looking for you. - Looking for who? - Mayang. - What's his name? - Vincent. Dad treats us differently. To him, I always fail. I never got good grades at school. The way I look? I'm not attractive for men. Sekar is different. She's beautiful. She's smart. On top of that, she works in Hong Kong. She can send money to dad regularly. It all makes dad underestimate me even more. The neighbors too. And that means you and Sekar don't get along? I'm jealous of her. She always gets special treatment. I hate her! But last night, to see her willing to do anything for money, it made me think. How would my dad feel, how would my mom feel, if they knew what kind of work Sekar is doing here. What about how you feel? I'm crushed. Mayang! That was a good shot. Everybody is looking for you now. They all worry about you. But you didn't tell them that I'm here, did you? Well, I didn't. Because I promised you. But, don't you want to meet your sister? Or is it because of Gandi? What can they do to help me? You don't miss your sister? Finish the chat? Come on, let's go eat. What's wrong with you? Can't you see I'm having a serious conversation with her? Why are you yelling at me? Don't come here again! Why don't you just go and eat! I brought my own food. You better go and get the food alone! Ti! Yati! Yati! This is today's salary. Boss, starting tomorrow, could you raise my salary? No way. It's fixed. Even if you quit, tons of people want this job. Thank you. What's up, Mayang? Do you know the address of Super Credit? Yes. But what do you want with that? Nothing. I just want to know. Hey, Vincent, come over here. - Any new items coming in? - Here. I want this one. How much? 2000 HKD. 1500 HKD. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Are you a new customer? You have to fill out this form first. Here. Running out of money too? Yes. And you? Me too. How can I not? My husband keeps asking me for money. Last time, he asked me for money to buy a cellphone. And now he wants to buy a scooter in installments. He doesn't know how hard I work here to get the money. If he dares to cheat on me, I would go berserk. What about you? You're two weeks late! Your fine is even bigger than your loan! Do you understand? What are you doing here? What about you? What are you doing here? I just wanted to know the company that has got Sekar in trouble. After you know, and then what? I don't know. It's none of your business anyway. Everybody is meddling too much in this matter. These are not working. Try it. We will open in an hour. It's okay. I will just wait. Oh, you're the girl who screwed around here yesterday. You're not welcome. Go away! I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do it. Go away! You're not welcome. Can you do me a favor please? Boss, I really need some money. I promise you, I won't do it again. It's useless. We're not hiring anymore. Please. I beg you, boss. I can do anything. - Really? - Yes, boss. What is your price per night? What is the job? Entertain the customers, of course. - Sari! Sari. - What? You told Vincent and Gandi that I went to Super Credit, didn't you? I only told Gandi. How was I to know that he would tell Vincent too? I don't care who told him, but I don't like it! Sari! Sari! - What happened to you? - I'm fine. - Did your employer hit you? - No. Answer me, Sari! It's my boyfriend! Enough! I'm fine! Every human has problems! Everybody has problems! Not only you! - Has the order been shipped? - Yeah. Hi, Mayang. Since I was a kid, I always thought I was the most unfortunate person in the world. When in fact there are many people around me who also suffer. I thought I could solve everything by myself. I don't need anyone else. I'm confused. Help me to find Sekar again, okay? Gandi and I always want to help you. Now we have the same goal. Sekar has to go back home. Did you have a crush on Sekar? Why did you ask me that? Every man would be attracted to her. Not every man is attracted to her. Just the same as... not every man thinks that Sekar is more beautiful than her sister. I'll hang up now. What do you want to eat? I broke up with Agus. I just wanted to tell you that. Did you see Gandi? - I have his number. - I don't have credit on my phone. Why do you want to see Gandi? I... know where Sekar is. You can use my phone. Give me his number. Come here, Yati. Sit here. Go ahead, use it. It's okay. Don't be scared. - Thanks for letting me use it. - Here's the number. Yati told me about it. So, when do you think you'll be ready to meet Sekar? But what should I say to her? We ask her how much her loan is. After that, we will try to offer to help her. What's important is, she knows, and can be sure, that her friends are ready to help. Will you go with me? I will go with you for sure. Suicide. Thank you. Hello. Have you heard? Yati is dead. People said she fell from the stairs. Yes, boss. Can I come over? - Sari. - I'm not in the mood to talk. - Have you heard Yati committed suicide? - Yes. I told you. Everybody has problems. I know. What about you? Are you okay now? When you look for a boyfriend, make sure you know everything about him. Don't just judge him by his looks. Just because he looks like Shah Rukh Khan... then you've agreed to go out with a guy that looks like that. I broke up with him. I'm sorry, Sari. I was too busy with my own problems. I've spent so much money to buy things for Amar and to spoil him. But now that it's over, I can use my money for other things. What do you want to use your money for? To buy my dad a rice field. I want to buy a rice field for my mom too. I'm sure you can do it. Thanks, Sari. Hey, hurry up! Why are you so late? What happened to your lips? Don't you know how to do your makeup? Hurry up! Those are big clients. We can't lose them. Hurry! Be more cheerful. You should earn your money happily. Go! Yes. Go. Coming... Hey, beauty. Come in. Come in. - Dad! - Sekar! Sekar... What are you doing? Gandi? Can we meet? Now? - Sekar! Open the door, Sekar. - Sekar! Sekar! Are you in there? Open the door, Sekar! Sekar! -Don't come any closer -Oh, my god. Sekar, how could you do this? Where have you been? Aren't you glad to see me dead? - Sekar. - Don't get any closer! - You misunderstood what I said. - Shut up! Why should you care about me? And you, Mayang! Why should you care about me? Dad told you to come here, didn't he? Tell him to come here! Let him see his favorite daughter shattered! Yes! Dad told me to come here! But I'm grateful that he did. Because now I know that I don't want to lose you. - Stop it! - Whatever! But one thing's for sure, I am here because I love you. Now you have to show me that you love me, by putting the scissors down. Let me help you, Sekar. This is the first time in my life, I'm willing to do anything for you. Not because I've been forced to, but because I want to. Sekar. What are we actually doing here? I just wanted to take you somewhere different. Vincent, it's ready. Okay, okay. I want to tell you a secret. Really? What is it? When we met at Indomarket, I told you I forgot that we've met before. I was lying. I remember our first meeting. Even though it was just for a few seconds. Beautiful. It's not crowded here. More people will come later today. We have an event here. But look who's already here. Let's go. Mayang, I'm going back home. In two years, I will be allowed to come here again. Please take care of Mom. - Yes. - And dad. Thanks, Mayang. How sweet. Don't fight again. It's almost starting. Where are you? Hurry up and get here. Hi, Gandi. So, what can I do to help? Help me take the drums, keyboard and the speakers to my house. Sekar, what job will you do in Indonesia? I'll work in a sugar cane farm. She will replace me there. - Back to the old job. - So you like it here? - Yes, I like it here. - Of course she does. She has a boyfriend here now. - No, I don't. - Who is your boyfriend? - Come on, just admit it. - That handsome guy with the fair skin. Look. There's your employer. Sir, Madam. Why are you here? We're here to see if you're alright. We heard what happened to you. We were told yesterday. If you have any trouble in the future, remember to tell us. Thank you, Madam. Thank you, Sir. You too, Saejun. Thank you. Mayang! Thank you.
