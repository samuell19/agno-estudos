I am cutting the crust of the mountains so that... you city people don't die of hunger. This is not the answer to my question. I am asking you the... reason behind settling down in this forest abandoning the city. Why are you working like a labour despite being the son... of a billionaire father? Look at that way, you will get the answer. It may lack all the glamours & comforts of city life, but you... will find beauty here too. The beauty of human courage & labor. People here are challenging the fate and trying their part... so that man become free forever... from the jungle of hunger. And if you consume the salt of your sweat someday with... the food, the stomach doesn't get upset. Father! - Hello father. - How are you? - I am fine. - How are you Kailash? - Fine. - How is the work going on? - It's going on well. Why did you come here, father? I have to ask you something, come with me. Congratulations on your desolate life. - But just listen to this! - Yes, father? - But are you ready for marriage? - Marriage? Answer me in one word. One word is very less. Please relax a little. Your mother had chosen this girl before her death, in your childhood. But time has changed a lot since then. World has also moved ahead a lot. How will I know what kind of a girl she is. You can have a look at her picture But I want to see her in person. If you want you can have a look at her from distance From a distance? But what will I know by seeing her from distance. Then will you know her, after staying together for 20 years? No, actually I want to know how she walks... & if there is so much fire in her body so as to cause a blast in me. I want to see if she is the same girl as she tries to portray herself to be? I stay in this forest. No lady from the city would like to stay here with me. It is surrounded by miles long of desolate mountains & lakes. In the night, there are crores of stars in the sky... and besides that the salt of my sweat. She will not be at all interested The girl should be asked about all these. You can write to her - Puran, have you loaded the car? - Yes Sir Kailash, would you come with me to Allahabad? No, I'll stay in this mental hospital for some more days. But whom and where to should I write the letter? Miss Chandra, CIO-Post Master, Allahabad. - CIO Post Master! Doesn't she have a residence? - She has... But you just want to know about her character. So what'll you do by knowing her address? Don't write anything to upset her - Have you finished the letter, sister? - I can't write anymore Please try it again - What are all these then? - What will our father say? - That's the problem Otherwise I would have told him on the first day that... I don't want to go & live in the forest And who knows, if Mr Raj is blind or deaf You should have told these to father. I thought I'll solve the problem by writing a letter. But even writing is big problem. Oh! It's already 4. I will play tennis at five then a dance program at seven! And I have promised to go to Nishad for dinner at 9 So where is the time to write a letter, and that too to a person... who wants a buffalo, not a wife - Buffalo? Yes, one with a rope of engagement tied in its neck... from childhood. He should actually marry some hilly lady Will you please write a letter on my behalf? Me? You want me to write a letter, sister My dear sister, just write the letter! - But... - No buts But write in such a way that he won't send a reply! And if father comes to know of it, then? He will never know as this is a secret between you and me - But what will I write? - That's not a problem Write that my body is full of black stains as... I had small pox in childhood - Pox? - And I am blind in one eye. - What? I am cripple too. People call me as bicycle -Bicycle? Also write that I keep coughing the whole night Don't forget about cough, because males are scared of it What is the use of Dr. Kailash, if my daughters keeps coughing Kailash has gone out. But I am hearing the cough today only So you don't know? - Were you coughing, Chandra? - Not me, Nilu. Okay, mother... Have you written the letter? I'll post it today - Show it to me What are you up to? You leave, daughter - What is the matter? - Should you read your children's letters? Chandra, the place where I live doesn't have the brightness &... noise of the city. It is surrounded by desolate mountains for miles. The lake is also visible from my writing place It seems now as if the lake has fallen asleep under cover... and the cover has bright stars of the night on it The tall mountains guard the sleeping lake, but the moonlight... pass through without their notice and plays with the... lake waters the whole night. You may not like this world I don't want to force you to come to me, but I surely want... somebody to marry me so that I become hers. Yours... Dear... Dear... I want somebody to marry me, so that I completely become hers Dear... Nilu, you should go to see Raj for once, and his desolate place And the place is only forty miles away from here. You can go either by bus or by train in the morning & come back in evening 'Will you go? ' Have some tea - Let me finish the letter, Puran Dada - Are you writing to the bride? - How do you know I know everything -I am going to Allahabad for two days... as father has called me for some business purpose Got it? Here goes Chandra's letter. And here is the report! What a problem! Where are the envelopes? Did you see the envelopes? Take this - Finish your tea first. - Don't make me panic, else I will put... Chandra's letter in father's report & vice versa by mistake Post this letter. I am leaving I'm Chandra - Which Chandra? I mean, is there any letter for Miss Chandra -Let me check Take this - Thank you Ms. Chandra. Sister? Since when have you started reading my letters? - Sister, this is my letter. - Yours, on my name? Actually, I have started writing letters in your name... after father gave you the permission to write letters. - Give it to me, sister! Please, sister! - Wait a minute, I'll just come. Construction report! Bricks, cements, coolie! I want to ask why this delay in the Dam construction - Who will be responsible for the loss? - Where is the loss? Raj is looking after the business on his own. If you want to fight with elephants, you should... Please speak slowly. Your heart is... I am not shouting. Why hasn't Raj arrived yet? Go and give him a call - Have you send him a letter to come with the report? - Yes What are you waiting for? Just go and call him up! Why the delay in constructing the Dam! I want to ask why do people delay in taking birth? Slowly, Mr Rajbahadur Your heart is... You keep silent. Why hasn't Raj arrived yet? What's the hurry, Uncle - I am going to call Raj - Raj? - Yes, to you - You are... - Me! You became angry without reason. We just wanted report This is the report, father, sorry for the delay -So you are here Chandra, the stars are still shining, but the brightness is not like before. Moonlight still plays with the lake water, but it has lost its charm too! What are you reading? Read properly The mountains are still on guard, Since you have come, I have lost interest in Dam work, Chandra It's enough Secretary. We have got the answer Raj! Raj! Excuse me There must be a letter for Miss Chandra, in care of Post Master Please give that to me as I have put some important papers... in that envelope by mistake. Please give it to me. You should be careful before sealing the letter Fretting is needless after you messed up! Hail Lord Ram! What a lecture you have given to me. I'll just have to travel... 100 miles to get that letter Fretting is needless! You might get beaten, someday! I'll come back by the evening, as the distance is only 40 miles - But where are you going? - That's a secret I kept your secret, now it is your turn to keep my secret. Didn't you know about give and take! But where are going & whom are you going to meet? Didn't I tell you sister? This is a secret. But who is he? I'll tell you everything after coming back What will I tell if my father asks about you? Give him some excuse, - Excuse? - Yes. As you are an expert. Tell him that I have gone for a picnic with my friends -Nilu. Slowly, if mother comes to know, she will create problems But come back by the evening - Ok Leela! Sheela! Priyatama! So all of you are saying that Nilu hasn't gone to your place But you are saying that she has gone for a picnic Chandra, you told me that, Why are you crying? Why don't you say clearly. - Actually we had a fight at night... - What happened at the night? - Fight? - Yes, mother. And she told me that she will go far away from me. I told you that she has gone... for a picnic out of my fear only. - I thought she'll come back. - She is not coming back! You shouldn't quarrel with your own sister like this What's the matter?

"Still she has made a place in my heart" "Every part of my body began to smile," "I don't know those eyes, can't recognize her heart." "Still she has made a place in my heart" "Every part of my body began to smile," "Don't know whose voice comes and teases my heart & goes." "Don't know whose voice comes and teases my heart & goes." "I feel shy by listening to him" "Who is this, who has come inside me" "Every part of my body began to smile," "I don't know those eyes, can't recognize her heart." "Still she has made a place in my heart" "And made me suffer everyday" "I was looking for her in the stars..." "And in the cold winds of Spring" "I was looking for her in the stars..." "And in the cold winds of Spring" "I am not lesser than anybody..." "Then why did you hide your face from me..." "And made me suffer everyday" "I don't know those eyes, can't recognize her heart." "Still she has made a place in my heart" "Every part of my body began to smile," "I have fallen in love without seeing him" "And I am ready to give my life for him If I see him" "I have fallen in love without seeing him" "And I am ready to give my life for him If I see him" "Just tell me for once, what is this play of yours, oh magician!" "It made every part of my body smile" "I don't know those eyes, can't recognize her heart." "Still she has made a place in my heart" "Every part of my body began to smile," Open the door Open the door - Who locked the door? - He who left - Left? - But not before making all the arrangements - What arrangements? - He sent a telegram to Police and told them that a girl has run away from Allahabad. Police will come here shortly. - Who is he to do all these? - He also said the... same thing that had he known you, he would have dragged... you home by holding her ears Younger sister is here, Sir - Neelu! - Dear! Are you mad to run away from home like this? Yes, you should not run away like this. And quarrels are normal between sisters. You are a silly girl. Even if you quarreled with her you shouldn't have run from the house! Go & beg pardon from your sister I say that home without wrangle is like a graveyard! Please come, Inspector But how did you get the idea of quarrel, sister? Had I not said that, they would have asked a lot of questions - Now tell me who was he? - Who! The person who sent you the letter - I couldn't meet him - Why? - He was not there. But what happened to him? - Whom? - The person for whom I wrote on your behalf? I was about to tell my dad that I'm not interested in marrying Raj This is your letter. Did you get the earlier letter -Yes - This is your letter. - Thank you. - What happened? - I tore the envelope. I wanted to see the sender's address. Oh! You! So you have come back. You agreed to my advice! How is your fool? - What is the meaning of this cry? - This is the meaning Which girl did I tease? I say, why did you hit me? Who told you that I teased her? - How dare you.. - Hey get lost. Oh God! What are you guys doing? If you want to fight, go and fight in your house. Naidu! What's going on? - Please call the police. - Yeah sure! Police! Police! Hey stop all this! Hail Lord Ram! You will be beaten someday, huh? So all these happened just for an envelope Yes, I wanted to see the stamp of the sender's place -Seen it No, that girl would have sent me to the jail. Luckily, a friend of mine came there & rescued me from police - Have you met her after that incident? - No, but I am pining to to meet her. She is the first ever to make place in my heart When I see her, I feel some music. But she loves some fool And who is the other whose character you wanted to know You had started falling in love with her too Chandra! I have never seen her. I just imagined a picture of her... through her letters. But as soon as I meet this girl... Chandra's image begins to fade away. I don't see anything else. What are you going to tell your father? What about Chandra? - I have asked Chandra to meet me. - Where? - In the Dam. But I now feel that it was not good. If she comes to know that I have sold myself to somebody else, what'll she do? If you want to meet me, come over to the desolate place... where you will spend the life with me. I'll come to receive you in Sripur station. But how will you recognise me? I'll will put a rose in my coat. No, I'll tell him clearly that I am Nilu, not Chandra, who hates Raj. "I was looking for her in the stars..." "And in the cold winds of Spring" "I am not lesser than anybody..." "Then why did you hide your face from me..." "And made me suffer everyday" "I have fallen in love without seeing him" "And I am ready to give my life for him If I see him" "I have fallen in love without seeing him" "And I am ready to give my life for him If I see him" "Just tell me for once, what is this play of yours, oh magician!" "It made every part of my body smile" - You? - I didn't know that you came this far to meet me - To meet you! - Why? What's wrong in me? People say that I have a very beautiful face -They are blind Well that's a possibility! What happened? I didn't expect that you'll appear here too. I understood. That fool must have come to receive you... and may have gone back seeing both of us together See, how jealous the male can be. I feel like smashing your face - Do it as you have almost... done it in the post office. See, if that fool works in... some Dam, I can give you a safe lift up to there No, I'll not go in your vehicle. Madam, you should definitely fight with me... - but why are you fighting with yourself? Board in the car. - I hate you. I am also a free man. I'll go whenever I feel like Hello! How are you? I thought you must be feeling hungry. Eat this food. You seem to be quite eager to meet that fool. But I know you will be quite depressed to meet him. I'll give you lift, come. I will reach you to that fool immediately, I promise. Come Listen, have a seat! This donkey is of excellent breed! Come on! Puran! Puran! What is it, sir? If a girl comes to meet me, tell her that I'm near the hill. Raj. Raj. Oh, you? As if the lake has fallen asleep and it is covered with a... blanket full of thousands of bright stars. The mountains keep on guard - But moonlight passes through, and plays with the lake water for all the night! - Raj! - I told you that you'll be depressed to meet that fool Even I am also not the one, whom you are taking me to be - I don't want to know anything, just want to feel. - But Raj Don't speak. Just listen to what the Shehnai wants to speak. "The anklets are producing a melodious sound" "I have arrived with my merry dancing" "The anklets are producing a melodious sound" "I put on my make up in front of the mirror of the moon" "And brought hopes in the palanquin of the stars" "See both the bride & the bride- groom are so happy" "The veil can't cover my beauty!" "It exudes through my eyes!" "The anklets are producing a melodious sound" "Union of two hearts is known as marriage..." "The one who is loyal with each other..." "The earth and the sky..." "This is a time for reunion..." "I glimmer like moon!" "My bindiya (dot on forehead) is shining..." "The anklets are producing a melodious sound" "Ambience around me is filled with love!" "My heart sings the song of love!" "Look the gathering is here with hands in hands..." "My garland is fragrant..." "Along with my beloved..." "My heart is intoxicated..." "The anklets are producing a melodious sound" "I am all decked up!" "But my body aches!" "My eyes crave for you!" "The anklets are producing a melodious sound" "The anklets are producing a melodious sound" "The anklets are producing a melodious sound" They have just got married. Please bless them. May you have all the happiness of the world This is for you. Chandra, please bless them - Me? - This suits you Sir, that's very nice of you. May God make you happy! She was really looking like a doll. Now the groom will take her to the hut which he has made with his hands I also have made a hut with my own hands & I'll take Chandra to that hut. But Raj, if I am not your Chandra then? Then I'll destroy the hut. Spring has appeared in this desolate place after your arrival here. If you go away, only dust'll be here You had told me that life is harsher than dreams If you wish, the dream can be transformed to life I will speak to my father tomorrow itself -Raj! Yes, Chandra. I know why have you come here. You have seen the character and now you want to see the face. I have seen the face also. I accept this relation. I don't accept the relation. - Chandra? - That's right, mother! I don't want to spend my life in the forest. - Chandra! - That's, right, dad! I have decided this after a lot of consideration. I have read his letters about the desolate place. But sister - Be silent. This is a question of my life. This is the road, this is our house & this is our small garden I want to grow all the flowers in my garden, Kailash Champa, jasmine, marigold, rose, narcissus! Chandra will fill a lot of colours & fragrance to my life I was showing the drawing of my house to Doctor Why don't you take a look at it? Here it is. Raj, Chandra has refused this marriage Both side of the road will be filled with flowers. What did you say? Chandra has refused this marriage. What? I planned the whole garden & the house for her only Doesn't matter Raj. I'll find a better girl than Chandra No, I'll meet Chandra and ask her about this - Is Mr Raj at home? - Both Sir & Madam has gone - Is Chandra at home? - Tell him that I am not at home. - I'll not go without meeting her. - Close the door This is a punishment. I'll open the door. Please think a little - Beware, don't open the door I should go and tell Raj everything. 'It doesn't matter if he hates you or discards you! ' But tell him the truth. Raj! Raj! Raj is not having high fever, but this cough is not good for him I will take an x-ray tomorrow. He'll be alright in 2-3 days. But this cough... Raj. Chandra! Have you come to see whether I am dead or alive, Chandra? No, I have come to beg forgiven from you Raj, I am not Chandra, I am not Chandra, but her younger sister Nilu Chandra has refused this marriage from the beginning. I had written that letter on behalf of her Nilu -Please forgive me. Don't speak. Just listen to what the mountain is speaking Listen to what the waterfall is speaking I am going to meet your father day after tomorrow. - Will he refuse the marriage? - No. - And Chandra? You? - You are having fever. - Me? No, I am now young. "I don't know how much love I have for him in my heart?" "Why do I love him so much?" "I don't know how much love I have for him" "If I do things after thinking well I would not cross the limits" "Why do I act with ignorance & then die out of confusion." "Then die out of confusion." "Why do I love him so much?" "I don't know how much love I have for him in my heart?" "Why do I love him so much?" "I don't know how much love I have for him" "Every time I fight with the entangled hair of mine." "And apply kajal in my eyes" "I would not have dressed up like like this if he is not coming." "Why do I love him so much?" "I don't know how much love I have for him in my heart?" "Why do I love him so much?" "I don't know how much love I have for him" "The first love gives a sweet pain." Why do I fall in this problem despite knowing all this? "Why do I love him so much?" "I don't know how much love I have for him in my heart?" "Why do I love him so much?" "I don't know how much love I have for him" Why are you dressed up so nicely today? Who is he? You will get to know soon - Is he coming to meet father -Yes Somebody wants to meet you, younger sister Your radio - Please keep it inside Had it been a minor disease, I would have kept it a secret from Raj. But he has severe tuberculosis - Tuberculosis? - Yes. Then my worst fear has come true - Fear? Yeah, Kailash. Raj's mother also died of same disease. Therefore, I kept Raj always in fresh air, away from the pollution of the city. I was feeling happy thinking that Raj has been spared. I will try my best to save Raj No, Kailash We had tried our best to save his mother too But nobody could come in the way of death How happy he is today... as he is going to have a talk with the father of his would-be bride. How'll he react now? I haven't told him yet, now tell him I won't be able to tell him. You do that job Hello, Kailash!

I'll leave as it is late Daughter, I'll leave now, as I am getting late for a meeting I'm taking you to the Sanatorium. - Do you have any message for Nilu? - No. - But she will be waiting for you Let her wait, as it is better than marrying one who is dying. "Don't know why..." "Don't know why I love him so much." "Why do I love him so much?" "If I had known that I will cry for him!" "I would have never loved him!" "Don't know why..."

What has happened to you, Nilu Nothing has happened to me Look at me, I am your mother. Don't hide anything from me I am not lying. I am ready to be a beggar for your sake. Tell me who he is I will beg to him to have mercy on you My dear, just tell me who he is! Tell me. I have never spoken to anyone about him He is... - Yes, dear... - Neelu! What's the name? Please tell me who he is - He is no one Have you seen this? She will become mad I think we should arrange for Nilu's marriage What will happen from that? - I think she will be more despaired! - New life heals old wounds Woman forgets all the old grief after few months of marriage What will people say, if the younger gets married... - earlier than the elder? - Which people? Only Raj Bahadur. And he told that he has no objection He says he'll wait & Raj's health is also not well these days. Ask Nilu about it first I'll make her agree. I request you not to delay. The X-ray is in front of you. Raj's other lung is also affected And the gap between his life and death has become narrow Is it the final decision? Is there no hope? It's not possible, Kailash! You know best, as you are also a doctor What's the use of my qualification if it can't save my friend's life? And what's the use of the progress of science... if it can't remove some dust from the lungs The battle is still going on in laboratories in every corner of the world. And some hopes are seen. In a few years with the progress of science, the disease will not be... so dangerous and the patients will be able to remain alive. - But in how many years? - As per the renowned doctors... - It'll take 8 to 10 years. - How long will Raj be alive in this condition? Well he is not going to live that longer! He won't be alive for more than two years. I am helpless, Kailash. Nor can the science! - Hello, Raj. - Hello, Kailash. So how far have you walked today - Don't try to deviate. I want to know how long will I be alive? Your other lung is also affected, Raj What a joke you played, Kailash You brought the bouquet of... those flowers which I wanted to place in someone's hair. I will try my best to give you the best of comforts... during your stay here. I have heard that the lace below the... rope for hanging is made with some cotton in the inner part... so that the person to be hanged doesn't suffer in death. - I didn't want to mean that. - I too didn't want to hurt you I may not have any power over my death, but I can surely... decide where I will die. I am not going to die in the hospital I am not going to die in the hospital "The isolation of this evening and sorrow caused by you." "The isolation of this evening and sorrow caused by you."

As they say, one should cut his coat according to the cloth I don't have much time with me, & I've lot of pending works - Works? - Yes, I have to do something for Nilu too - What will you do? - I will do that what nobody has done in love I'll create so much hatred for me in that heart... for which I would have given my life to secure a place for me. I'll snatch the away the smiles from those lips. For whose kisses I would have risked my life thousand times... I'll do everything... Neelu will forget about me... So that my bad image will be such that... the people will tell her, that Raj was a bad man Forget about that scoundrel! Please sing a song, Chandra A song which will... No, I'll not sing Oh come on, Chandra. Sing the song! I told you I am not going to sing! Kailash, you can only ask her to sing a song now -I won't sing If you don't feel well after singing then it'll be my responsibility, as I am your family doctor. - Please, sing the song! - Excuse me, I will be just back. Hello, Kailash. Raj, how come you are here? - Why not? I have got truckload of time! - You should take rest now How can I be at home when you are having a party This party looks quite great! Silence, now Chandra will sing a song - Who is that lady in black dress? - Chandra, Nilu's sister - Oh? - What's the matter? Nothing. - Who is he? - He is Raj. Don't you know him? Oh! "I heard about you a lot without seeing from the Spring that..." "When I saw you, my heart began to burst with happiness" "I heard about you a lot without seeing from the Spring that..." "When I saw you, my heart began to burst with happiness" "You were always hiding from my sight" "But my heart told me that it was only you" "You coloured my hopes with your eyes" "I heard about you a lot without seeing from the Spring that..." "When I saw you, my heart began to burst with happiness" "Although I had refused his love before..." "Now I have fallen in love with him" "And I was bowled over!" "I heard about you a lot without seeing from the Spring that..." "When I saw you, my heart began to burst with happiness" "My heart did not bow to anyone earlier" "But don't know what has happened to me now" "Don't go away from me as I am bursting with happiness" "I heard about you a lot without seeing from the Spring that..." "When I saw you, my heart began to burst with happiness" That was great. So you are Chandra I couldn't recognize you. I thought of you to be a different person. Did you think, I will have four legs & horns on my head Not like that - But almost similar to that You had great fondness for the life around those hills & lakes I had to abandon that desolate place as you couldn't leave... the brightness of the City. - How long'll you be here? - Till you wish So we have reached your home - Should I leave now Will you come for dinner tomorrow? Please, you have to! How can I refuse your invitation. I will surely come Okay, then I will leave now. Don't you forget! Bye, bye! Neelu! Do you know whom did I meet today, Nilu -Whom? I met Raj. I had refused him without meeting him But he appeared to be a completely different person How was he? - Very lovely - Did he say anything? Yes, he told me that he had to leave behind the desolate place... as I was not ready to leave the city. And he also told me... that he will stay here as long as I want him to. There must be some reason in it - What reasons -Nothing Forgive me, as I tell anything in this condition of mine I know. Even I shouldn't say these things to you now. As I got back my Raj, you will also get back your love someday. Forget it, sister! - He will never come. - He will surely come I have invited Raj for dinner tomorrow. He'll come here Where is mother? Nilu, set the table in a way that father will sit here & mother there... you will sit here & he will sit there. I & Raj will... sit opposite to each other so that both of us see each other properly. How is this arrangement? Very nice. Mr Raj has arrived, Madam Here you are - How can I refuse your invitation? Let me introduce you to my younger sister. Meet my sister, Nilu - Nice meeting you You know him already - Seems, I have met you earlier also That must be your illusion. You may have seen her in dream It is possible, as I dream a lot Your sister got upset. She might not have liked my coming here It's not like that. Nilu had fallen in love with a guy, who left her Neelu used to love someone. Since then she neither speaks well nor laughs - Who was he? - Don't know, as she never takes his name Sorry, as I hurt her wounds - That's OK, as you didn't know Yeah, how would I? How are you Raj - Greetings! - Greetings, dear! Bless you. - Hello, Kailash. - Hello, Raj. How is Mr. Rajbahadur? - He is fine. So how are you, sir? - I am fine, dear. Please have a seat I'll ask my mother to serve the dinner. What's the hurry? Give him some juice first -OK Okay. So Raj, I hope you are doing fine? How is your construction job going on? The workload is increasing day by day Then it's good for Mr Rajbahadur, as he will earn a lot of wealth from that - Isn't it, Kailash? - Right. Right. You didn't have anything, Raj - No, I had enough Kailash, let's go and sit in the drawing room. You sit here Why don't you sit here too? We want to know each other well. As you are Chandra's sister Please have a seat -Yes, Nilu I had almost forgotten by staying in the forest for so long... what is it to sit amidst people. And how eyes speak with others. - You seem to be a poet. - I can even say about one's... heart by reading the hand. - Give me your hand. - Leave my hand. Please read her palm! This is a nice hand. You will have all the comforts in life This is your heart line. The man with whom you are in love... - I don't like these kinds of pranks. - I am not joking. The man with whom you are in love is a fraud. I don't like this joke. Let it be! Now have a look at my hand. How can I see that hand, as it has my fate written on it - Oh I forgot it totally! - Neelu! That's why your health is deteriorating. - Listen, Kailash. - Yes. Kailash, what do you think about that tonic? Nilu, take this betel-leaf to your brother-in-law Well, I must say it's efficient! Why are you taking the trouble, I'm right here Why are you crying? Nilu, are you crying as your sister will leave you? I am going to take you also with me Why will she go with you? She will go to her own house after her marriage. I'll have great fun then. I'll sing & dance But on this happy occasion, Nilu should sing a song today - Will you sing? - No Please sing a song -No You told me that you will sing and dance! Come on, sing it now! Sister, today, I... She will not sing today - No, she will sing How can I not sing on this good day? Mother The day on which the house will be filled with sound of Shehnai... and decoration, and my sister's hand coloured with henna. Your wishes will be fulfilled! Your dreams will come true! And that day! "When the King's marriage procession will be here and..." "The night will be colourful, I will dance merrily." "I will dance merrily." "When the King's marriage procession will be here and..." "The night will be colourful, I will dance merrily." "I will dance merrily." "When the King's marriage procession will be here and..." "King's forehead will have 'tilak' & queen's will have vermilion" "Queen's will have vermilion." "I will also fulfil my desire" "By applying henna in my hands and dance merrily with my friends" "I will dance merrily." "When the King's marriage procession will be here and..." "The queen & king will go to another place in a palanquin" "The queen & king will go to another place in a palanquin" "Whenever I remember them, their memory will pierce the heart" "There will be tear in my eyes and I'll dance alone like a mad" "I'll dance alone like a mad" When the King's marriage procession will be here and... the night will be colourful, I will dance merrily. "I will dance merrily." "When the King's marriage procession will be here and..." Mad girl, What is there to cry so much now? Great. Your sister really sings well. I'll leave now. - Are you leaving? - Yes, I think it's late. Will you come to the Dam tomorrow? Please bring Nilu too Don't forget. Good bye now - Kailash, shall we? - Let's go. - Come. - Bye. Please don't bother! - That's fine. Please, this way! Give my greetings to Mr. Raj Bahadur Sure. Be careful, otherwise you'll slip - Not now Neelu! Wait, Neelu! Dada, please prepare the tea. Nilu & Chandra will arrive soon. How is your health now? Alright. The day I am waiting for seems to be drifting away Don't speak like this, son. Everything will be alright You! But you had gone for swimming in the lake I found an excuse. I told my sister that I've forgotten something here. You didn't do right by telling a lie And what about your acts? What am I doing? You told me earlier that you can't live without me. Now you are playing the same game with my sister You also had written letters to me in Chandra's name I only used her name. But the thoughts & feelings were mine You could find my soul amidst those words! What has happened to you? Why have you changed like this? - What's the secret? - Secret? - Why have you put on this mask? I am not wearing any mask. I never fell in love with you. - You are telling me a lie. - You don't want to know the truth So these answers don't mean anything! The whole world lives on trust. Trust on humanity. Reason is, If you become false, there is nothing like truth... God and faith in the world. Go with your foolish talks to some other place. There is no place for truth, God & faith in my life. - Where is Mr. Raj? - There in the room Go out from here, else what will Chandra think of us? Let her come here. Sister come here. - Neelu, you are here? - Yes, I am here. I want a decision. - What? Yes. I have to ask him whether he loves me or you -What? Mr. Raj, what's going on here? The fraud he was mentioning about while seeing my hand... - was only himself. - Is it true? - Yes Ask her whom she had written letters in your name And then she met me with your name! - Her name is not Chandra! - Neelu! Let's forget about that! Now since we are engaged... and even when Neelu knows about this she is still trying to instigate me! Ask her... why she wants to take the vermillion from her sister's forehead to her. And if she claims otherwise, then ask her what is she doing in my room? Come on, Neelu, answer me! This is false. I swear by your name - Leave me Sister! Sister! Raj, how long will you give pains to Nilu like this? This is not enough. Do you think I enjoy what I do? My heart squirms in anguish every time I hurt her! But Kailash, I want her to condemn me! I want to hurt her even more! So that she will forget about me! And she will forget about my love! Will it happen? I will make it happen, Kailash! I will erase my memories from her heart before I'll die! I will try my best to do that so that she gets married to a good person. With whom she can spend her life happily! - Will you marry her, Kailash? - Me? Are you mad? You know the love in her heart. You can only understand the pain in her heart. What will happen by this? Kailash, at least I will die in peace. Any other person will give more pains to her. She has already suffered a lot. Do you know what you are asking from me? I know. I am asking for a cream to heal Nilu's wounds And the last happiness for me. Will you give it to me? Will you give it to me? - Are you happy now? - Yes. And whatever happened was good. - I liked him from start. - Whose marriage are you talking about? - Nilu's marriage, with Doctor Kailash. - Nilu has agreed Dr. Kailash has just left. Yes! Is it true, Nilu? Yes - But why? Why? Can't I get married? - Is it because of me? - No, I gave you pain. Raj was right. I wanted to snatch the vermillion from your forehead for me Please forgive me, sister Let me go, I'll have to go. - No, you can't go. - But my only son is in such bad health and... You are not in a position to go out now... I have called for Dr. Joseph, there will not be any lack in his care. But if I want to go - You can't travel in this health If Raj becomes alright, Dr. Joseph will bring him here - I wanted to go there, but... - I know Because you are getting married to Nilu. But you were his friend. Couldn't you even wait for some days? Raj was stubborn that I should marry her while he is still alive. I was helpless. But I was not compelled by my heart. - Kailash! - Yes, sir. Please forgive me. I thought it the other way. Even the world will think it the other way. But I don't care. I am just worried about Raj. What Raj has done, can't be done by anyone else Even nobody can even what you have done. Raj, my son I ran away from you from the Sanatorium... but you reached here too. I will ask Kailash about this when I can meet him. Purandada! Purandada! Yes, dear? Purandada, what music is this? Two labour people are getting married. They came here seeking your blessings. I told them to go away No, I'll meet them. Please go and call them back May you have all the happiness of the world & you live long! - What's the date today? - 11th December. Only two days are left! I've to reach Riwa as soon. I've to reach Riwa as soon. Why do you want to go to Riwa? Nilu is getting married the day after tomorrow. This rascal Kailash is also old-fashioned He told me that marriage... should take place in the house of his forefathers. Will you take me to Riwa, please? You can't travel in this health, Raj -I know I told you in the Sanatorium also that my death... may not be in my hands, but I can at least decide where I will die. Purandada! Please post this letter, Purandada. That time has come Post this letter. "If you can, come down to see this sick sorrow man of yours" "You may not have seen..." "You may not have seen, how the final breath goes out..." "From one's body" "Come, as my heart is calling out to you..." "Even sorrow got defeated by my cries. My love should not get a bad name" "My heart is getting scared." - Have we reached Satna? - Not yet "At least come to meet me in my dreams" I'll surely come to meet you, Nilu as I had promised to you This is such a strange race! I am coming to you and death is after me Let's see who reaches first You should have at least sent a letter to Raj's father But he is also sick. Will he reach home -May be! Don't be worried, Purandada. I'll not die in the train Take this to bride. Chandra, what are you doing here? Come on! I didn't want to put the mark of my funeral ash in Nilu's forehead So I made all these drama. This secret is only known to 3 people This was my secret. Now I have revealed to you also. Promise me that you'll never... tell Nilu the truth. Tell her always that I was a bad man Pour water in his memory. Will you take me to Riva? Will you take me to Riwa? At this hour? - You seem to be mad. - Why? Wild animals can come... this way at night. Have rest in the waiting room I'll take you there in the morning - I don't have that much time - I'll pay a good fare. - You'll pay the fare & God will give death Death is coming after me. Let's see who reaches first. - Will you go? - Yes, I'll go there thousand times for this money. Please hurry up. I'll be grateful to you, if I reach on time Life! I have lived 32 years. I'm asking just 1 more night from you, Life Seems to be mad. He shouldn't ask the money back in Riwa I'll not ask the money back - You heard it, Sir Please make this mad man reach Riwa as soon - I must go there! - Okay, sir! I'll take you there! I will for sure!

I almost lost my breath How come you all are here? Nilu, I was coming to you myself To congratulate you and Kailash. What's this all, Kailash? What have you done, Nilu? She has done the same, what every married women do. Nilu is ignorant, but you all know that, then Kailash, you know everything. Nilu also knows it now - I couldn't keep it a secret. But still you want to... I didn't want to put my funeral's ashes in your forehead, Nilu If my service is successful, then this burial ashes will... turn out to be vermilion for me. - I want your blessings, mother! - Neelu! - But? - Yes Raj! Kailash? How could? 1000 years ago, Savitri claimed back her husband Satyavan... from death. It's not impossible. You may start living again. Hail Lord Krishna! Hail Lord Krishna!
