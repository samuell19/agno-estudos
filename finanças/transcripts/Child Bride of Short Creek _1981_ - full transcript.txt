In 1953, the small town of Short Creek became the target of an investigation by the state of Arizona. It was widely believed that members of the community practiced polygamy, with some men having as many as three or four wives and families. This is a dramatization based on actual events. Hello there. Bob Kalish. I'm a geologist. University of Utah. I'm out here looking for rocks. You better look elsewhere. Well, I better be getting back to Hurricane. Be seeing you. You won't be seeing me. You are in such a vital way both representatives and responsible to the people of our country. In great part upon you, on your intelligence, your integrity, your devotion to the ideals of freedom and justice themselves depend the understanding and the knowledge with which our people must meet the fact of 20th century life. Without such understanding and knowledge, our people would be incapable of promoting justice. Without them, they would be incapable of defending freedom. Important words from President Eisenhower that'll affect every person in this great country of ours. This is a big day. Yeah, it's the last day of school. That's right, Naomi, but it's also the day the atomic bomb was tested on the Nevada desert. And it's the day when our own hero, Isaac King, returns home from Korea. You girls must be proud of your brother. Well, have a good summer vacation. See you all back here in one hour for the homecoming. Jessica Jacobs, will you take the radio back over to the Otleys? And don't drop it. Dob, I need some help with the banner. That's good. Good. Okay, tie it off over there. OK, hold the other side. OK, that's good. OK, that's real good. Fine. Real good. Regional weather will be fair through Friday with highs from upper 80's in Salt Lake City to 104 in the south. Lows will be the high 50's and low 60's. Snowball, come on. Come on. Come on. Yes. That's a good Snowball. Look at you. You made it. I prayed to God and you made it. Yeah, I did. How's the foot? It's pretty good. It hurts sometimes. Well, the car's right here. The whole town's gonna be out. You're kidding. Big homecoming. I can tell. You got on your funeral suit. Will you stop fidgeting, Rachel? I'm almost done. OK, scoot. Stop dawdling. Will you hurry up so Garth can get in? Mom? Sand comes in under the door, I swear. Celebration's gonna be over and done with and you with soap between your ears. I did something I shouldn't. What? I listened to a song on the Otley's radio. What song? Something about hold me and thrill me. Trash, that's why it's a sin to listen. What does it mean? Take me in your arms and drive me out of my mind? You'll understand later when the time comes. Sometimes at night when daddy's sleeping with you, I can hear. Little pitchers got big ears. Rachel, you ready? Hurry up, Jessie. Your daddy's waiting for you at the store house. You want those new shoes, don't you? I want to be good, mama. Then don't think so much. Just put your trust in the Lord. , out. Out of that tub. Roland Torgenson can get you on Sharon's sheep. Lot of fruit to be picked down in Hurricane. Everybody's got to pull his weight. They ever going to oil this road? Oil it, people will start using it, nosing around. How's mama? Supposed to stay off her legs, but of course she don't. Big day for her. Son coming home from Korea a hero. I'm no hero. Got my toes frostbit is all. When's it going to bloom? Huh? The desert. You and the brethren said it was going to blossom like a rose. Don't you start being like you was before you left. We are making great progress. Great progress. Hurry, the band's already there. Nothing's gonna start without me. I'm his mother. But these are boys. Only ones your side. Try them on. I can't wear boys' shoes. Jessie. They're ugly, daddy. Naomi got new shoes, black ones with the little straps. I can't help it if Naomi's father don't play by the rules. I do. What I make goes into the common fund and out of that I get what I need for my family. I don't want to hear no more about it. But I hate them. And there's the dance today. You be thankful you got shoes at all. I tell you what, Jessie, I'll fix them so nobody will know. You'll see. We gotta get on out there. The boy's going to be here any minute. There. Private Isaac King, welcome home. Glad to be. Isaac. Isaac, thank God you're home. I'm so happy to see you. Say hello to Isaac. Doesn't he look wonderful? He's cute. Judge Sears, Sheriff's Deputy Bob Kalish. Yeah. I got some evidence OK on the polygamists. I'm driving back into Kingman now. Be at your office first thing in the morning. It's good to have you home again, Isaac. Thank you, brother Jacobs. Sister Jacobs. Sister Jacobs. This must be Judy Torrington. Not no more. Jay Jacobs and me got married. Well, congratulations, Sister Jacobs. Got me two little kids already. You remember. Earla Jenson. Naomi. Naomi Roberts. Don't mind him. He's always teasing. Hey, you sure grew. Wait a minute. You're not that little runt that was always playing with those paper dolls cut out of the Sears Roebuck catalogue. What's it like in Korea? It's cold. Come on, Isaac. We got people over here. I speak next to my brother. You know, Jay, Isaac's mother is too old to have more kids. My wife Isabelle is kind of high strung. My third wife has to carry the load. I have to think of my progeny. My kingdom here on earth and my kingdom in the hereafter. I put it to the Lord. It's his wish that I take another wife. Jay, I'm going to marry your daughter, Jessica. The Lord has spoke. Amen. They're all polygamists. Everyone calls them plygs. Both these ladies are married to Jay Jacobs. Now, this is his third wife. She lives up the road. Must have about 16 kids between them. See Judge, the old men get the pick of the litter. The young man got to go on work missions, then after a couple of years, President King and the brethren present him with a wife. What about the women? They've got nothing to say about it. It's the word of God. The women raise the families and when they get too old, they're put out to pasture. I'll call Phoenix, talk to the Attorney General. I have a feeling he's going to move on this. Has to. Can't just ignore it. Get back up there. Get all the evidence you can. Right. It has come to my attention that some of you mothers are guilty of picking up a child just because he cries. I see sister Judy Jacobs laughing over there. I guess the shoe is fitting Judy. I want my children to stand on their own feet, and the quicker they learn it, the better I like it. I don't know how to lead a whiner, and neither does God. You're listening, Naomi? I'm talking to you too. I expect you to grow up to be a grace in a man's house and in his life. You're going to bear children. You have to be upright and honorable. Let that sink into your heart. Even war heroes show up at these services on time. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. Can it be that I should gain an interest in the savior's blood? Died He for me, who caused His pain? For me who Him to death pursued. Amazing love, how can it be? Jacobs. Sister Jacobs. Sister Jacobs. Sister Jacobs. Jessica. I want a word with you. Yes, President King? I think it's time you started thinking about getting married. Don't scare me like that. I'm not joking, Jessica. You're 15. You should be raising a posterity. I want you to think about that. - OK. Good girl. Isaac. I don't understand your attitude. It's embarrassing. A son of mine should be an example. A son of mine should be prepared to fill his daddy's shoes. Naomi. What were you doing? I hate June bugs. They stink. You were kissing. So what? You're not supposed to. The brethren tell us who we marry. Bet that's a President King was talking to you about, huh? Getting married. Some old coot's probably already asked for you. You're going to have to quit school. What's it like kissing? Depends on who you kiss. President King's got lips like a gorilla. What would you do if God said you had to kiss him? Run away. You can't. I'm going to live in Las Vegas. I'll be an actress. Naomi. I am. I'm going to have me a big white refrigerator filled with cherry Popsicles. You couldn't leave. Nobody leaves. You just watch me. Crud. I hope I never see a man undress. You get used to it. I bet you would. I could never look him in the eye again. You ever think about God? I mean, that's He's up there looking down at us and seeing everything we do? He's up there with a big paddle ready to swat us. Hey, what you looking at? Harlan. He's always copping at you. He is not. Uh-huh. I bet you're supposed to be reading the Bible. Not looking at bare bodies. It's Sunday. Ada, Alma, go in the house. Where'd that magazine come from? What is it? National Geographic. You would do better to read the scriptures. Naomi, go on home now. I think you can find something useful to do. Jessica Rae, I thought you'd know better. Scriptures tell us there's a time for everything. Your time as a child is over. Did you decide that? Jessica Rae, go on home. We were only having some fun. You stay away from those girls. You start working. You start being a man. Yes sir. Put the hand down. Stop that clowning. I won't tolerate it. Yes sir. You just remember who you are and who I am. I'm your father. More than that, I'm a prophet of God. Yes sir. Jessica. You want to ride up front with me and the twins? No thank you. You may as well ride up front. She don't want to. I sit by Isaac. You're sitting with me. Alma. Hi. Hello. Can I have a plum? Help yourself. Thank you. You from Short Creek? That's right. You a plyg? These your wives? No. Hey, looks like pretty hot stuff. - Get lost. - How many you got? Get lost. Isaac. Isaac, Isaac. Polyg! The world is full of wondrous things. A word of love, a bird that sings. A joy to hold when man is pressed against the earth's sweet breast. Wait a minute. Oh. I've seen figures like these over in Hong Kong. It was carved out of ivory or something. Got more? Got a whole zoo. Snowball. You can have him. To keep? If you want. Put him right here next to my heart. Jessie. That's my mama. We can't be here alone. Jessie. We can't just stay here. Here. Private Isaac King, RA19427165. Jessie. What are you doing? Talking. We got peaches. Sister Jacobs, Sister Jacobs, Sister Jacobs. Roll down your sleeves. It's hot. No reason to be showing everything you got. Quit daydreaming and get up here. I see that Isaac every day walking across the field. May Clark says he told his father he wont' go on a work mission. Won't ever settle down. He was telling me about Hong Kong. I don't want you talking to that boy, Jessie. Don't look right. Hi. Look, I-- Now you get. Afternoon. It's nice and cool back here in the shade. Makes me kind of envy you women. We work hard enough. No one is denying that. We all work hard to make it green out here. Amen. You seen anybody snooping around? I thought I saw someone. He says he's a geologist, but I caught him taking pictures. Pictures? Could mean something. Then again, not. Might be from a newspaper or one of them magazines. And then again. There's going to be a raid. A raid? Hasn't never been one. Don't mean it won't never happen. There's a lot of people don't like us out there. But we've got a right to live the way God taught us. Amen. Don't worry about nothing. Just look up at that sky. Like a picture postcard. Blue and clear. God's up there. Right, Jessica Rae? He's watching over us, guiding us. He loves us, but he tests us every day. Am I right, Jessica Rae? Yes, President King. We obey Him and He keeps us safe. I brought you some cantaloupe. For us? Yes, Sister Jacobs, for you and the other sisters. And save a sweet one for Jessica Rae. Thank you, President King. I got to check my cows. I got two calves coming. He may have a direct line to God, but he don't know beans about life. Can't even keep his own son in line. Flies. Dirty flies. All my life I've been fighting flies. Mama? What? What are you doing? I'm enjoying myself. Can't I enjoy myself? You don't think I had my dreams? Poems I was always writing and rhymes. If there's a raid, you remember my real name, Mary Lawson, in case we get separated. You mean Mary Jacobs. No. I'm not married to your father legal. But I'm married to him in the eyes of the Lord and that's all that counts. There's not going to be any raid. You heard what President King-- President King. Why are men so damn dumb? I mean, I love your father and I'm proud to be a wife. A man's the sun and his wives are the planets. But it's all so dumb the way men set it up. And what's worse? I can't even help you. Oh, Jessie, you're growing up so fast. Mom, I love you. Oh, be careful, Jessie. Be a good girl and live a good life or I just want to die. Judge, welcome to Phoenix. Attorney General Ross. Bob Kalish. Gentlemen, what are you drinking? Water will be fine. You've been around the Mormons up in Sodom and Gomorrah too long. It's not exactly like that. They're not Mormons. The Mormons excommunicated the whole bunch years ago. Two roads into town? They both connect to the highway. The highway's nothing more than a dirt road. They got lookouts. They know everything that's happening for about 20 miles around. - They armed? The usual. Shotguns, mostly 12 gauge, deer rifles, some 22's. So they're armed. You think they'll use them? I don't know. Well, we're going to have to go in there. We can't turn our backs. It would be right, morally, legally, or politically. In a way that, we're dealing with an insurrection. I've ordered aerial surveillance. Let's give them a show of force. Do Lord oh do Lord oh do remember me. Do Lord oh do Lord oh do Lord oh do remember. Do Lord oh do Lord oh do remember me way beyond the blue. I've got a home in glory land that outshines the sun. I've got a home in glory land that outshines the sun. I've got a home in glory land that outshines the sun, way beyond the blue. Just what we need. A good strong man. What you got there? Painted on the hood of an old car. Kids found it in the junkyard, thought they'd like to do something with it. We're going to plant it on top of a mountain. How about a hand? Why, sure. Do Lord oh do Lord oh do remember me. Think I found a oyster. You're not talking to me? I'm not supposed to. They're afraid we might like each other. Look at them up there. Free as a-- Bird. What's it like flying? In an airplane? Yeah. Well, sometimes the sky's all puffy with clouds. Looks like you could just step out and walk on them like in heaven. I'd be scared. No you wouldn't. There's a lot of bad out there. Hey, I seen it. War and killing. My buddies calling people chiggers and gooks the way some people call us names. I was in a place where life meant nothing. There were times when all I wanted to do was come home. Now I'm hear. You could like it if you tried. I don't fit in. I never have. I wish I could. It'd make it easier. I'm a good mechanic. Worked with heavy machinery in Korea. I could make a life out there. They're going to marry you off soon, Jessie. I've got to catch up. You're just going to stay in that Sunday school all your life. Way beyond the blue. I've got a home in glory land that outshines the sun. I've got a home in glory land that outshines the sun. I've got a home in glory land that outshines. Apple juice. Soda pop. Watermelon. I'm so thirsty I could croak. Come on. Watch out for the devil. He don't bother brats. The twins! The twins are in the water. Please get them. Oh my God. Stand back. Stand back. Don't go close. Just stand back. Oh my God. My God! Oh my God. Dear God, this is a hard test. The hardest test. My family. My children, my little girls. Ada and Alma. But I know, dear God, that there's a reason and a plan. I have seen with my own eyes. I've seen the destroyer riding in power on the face of the water. He's in the water and in the air. I'm not talking off the top of my head. These daughters, my own sweet daughters, you show us this. They died so that we might live. No need for tears. We know that with God smiling and strong and good. Amen. Rock of ages cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee. Let the water and the blood from thy living side which flowed be our sin the double cure. Cleanse me from this guilt and power. Amen. Once in Korea, we cleared this place in the mountains. The ground was froze. We scraped off the top of their bulldozers and made camp. And in the night, it rained and the ground thawed. We was camped on a burial ground. And the bodies. They was wading and one of them slipped and the other one tried to save her. Why? Why is it a sin to learn how to swim? Can you tell me what's so wrong with that? Can you tell me why this whole town is so crazy? It's not crazy. Bet they did it on purpose. Naomi. They didn't want to have to marry some old coot. Stop it. Just stop it. Both of you just stop it. We're good people. There's good here. We've got the school and the band. We've got pianos and we have a choir. We've got telephones. We got 14 telephones, Isaac. They're not connected with the outside world, Jessie! Hey. Hey, who's that? Hey, hey. Where you going? Las Vegas. Hey, how about that? So are we. Well, leap in, limp out. Come on. Bet you're thirsty. Yeah, I am. That's Boyd Paul and I'm Ryan. I'm Naomi. Hey, there. your throat? I never tasted it before. Well, it don't bite. What are you doing? Never met a girl plyg before. Don't. What? Don't. Stop it. Hey, hold still now, come on. Stop it. We just want to get acquainted. Just hold still. Don't. Please, don't. Stop it. Hey, I can spot a girl plyg in the dark. Don't! Oh, looks like we got a fighting plyg here. Stop it! Stop it! Please! Coward! Run, run! Out. Get in my car. You and your friend come out here again, I'll kill you. Lookout spotted you early this morning. I've been watching over you. I guess you learned your lesson. Time for you to come home. The wheel of fortune. Spinning around. Will the arrow point my way? Will this be my day? Oh, wheel of fortune. Please don't pass me by. Let me know you're there. Oh. Oh. Please let it be now. Isaac? How long you been out here? All night. Are you all right? No. You've been drinking. You think these goodies don't drink? They just hide it. More people drinking here every year because they can't make sense out of what they're told. Listen, I don't want it. A bunch of wives and kids. I don't want to work my miserable life away just trying to feed them. They would help you and love you. You think my mom loves my dad? Women hate in this town. They're eat up with it because it's cruel. Polygamy is cruel. Who do you think you're promised to? I'm not. Jessie, the only way you're going to escape is if you run away or if there's a raid and this whole town is busted up. We don't kill or steal. Nobody's going to raid. I'm not waiting around to find out. You're President King's son. You can't run away. Nobody runs away. Wells Johnson did. He killed himself. I don't believe it. He's living in California. He's a lawyer like he always wanted and nobody calls him a plyg. Do they, Well? Careful. I don't want to be called a plyg. I don't want people gawking at me like I'm some freak. I don't want them thinking dirty thoughts about me. I don't want you to end up like my sisters. Do you understand? I'm trying. Stop. I won't hurt you. Will you hold still a minute? Just listen to me. I won't touch you. No touching. You have never even been allowed to have a boyfriend. You know what? What? We're freaks. You're starting again. Jesse, I want you to come with me away, out of here. No. I love my town and my life and my people. I want to live right and keep the laws of God and do what my mama says. I'm Jessica Rae Jacobs and I'm proud of it. You hear that, Isaac King? Naomi. I forgot something. You been sick or something? I can't talk now. Wait. Wait. They tied her to an oak. It's still a secret, but I heard my dad. They married her off to an old man to settle her down. Ray Otley. No. She's staying at her mama's. But one of these Sundays she's going to come to church with the rest of Otley's wives and a big belly. And she'll move in with him. Liar. Jessie, when are you going to wake up and die right? Leave me alone. Just leave me alone. Naomi. Is it true? Are you married to Ray Otley? He's so old. You was gonna live in Las Vegas. You was going to be an actress. It was a secret wedding, but I got to wear a white dress. What did you want me to do? Drown myself? Ma, what the hell are you doing? Will you sit? Oh, I'm not one to just sit. You're supposed to stay off your legs. I stay off my legs, I might as well be dead. Isaac, I worry about you. Hey, you don't have enough to do you gotta worry about me? Life is a serious business. You've gotta get work. Then you've gotta donate to the order for a couple years. Then you got to start to raise a family. You think the brethren would give me a wife? Oh, they would if you worked hard enough and accepted the principle plural marriage. Your daddy's going to take another wife. It's a revelation from God. Those revelations sure do come in handy. Oh, listen to you. Always joking. I'm not joking. All these years, hard years, loyal and sweet and god by your husband's side, and now he takes another wife? What about you? You raised six kids and now it's all over? What about his other wives? They getting too old and dried up too? It's our mission to replenish the earth. Does he have to do it all by himself? I just, I just want peace around here. Peace. What about a little joy? Ma, you're unhappy and you don't even know it. Don't you tell me what I don't know. You can go to Salt Lake and live with your sister. I'll work. I'll send you money. I want my life. I want you to have yours too. This is what I want, Isaac. This is what I know and this is where I want to be. You want to share your husband with another wife? My sister wives are the best friends I have in this whole world. We share the work and the pain and the joy. And there is joy. She's a lovely girl. She's close to my twins. Who is it? It ain't supposed to be announced yet. Who? I told you, a lovely girl. Who? Don't you pound your fist at me. Tell me. Jessica Jacobs. What's the matter with you? Where's dad? Well, why are you so upset? Where is he? What does Jessica Jacobs mean to you? Don't make trouble, Isaac. Don't. Dad. I want to talk to you. Talk is cheap. You have enough wives. Three is plenty enough. What's the matter with you? Jessica Jacobs is 15 years old. You're out of line, Isaac. Way out of line. You stay way from here, you hear me? Why you crazy good for nothing. What gives you the right? God. God gives me the right. Bull. From now on, I don't see you, I don't hear you, I don't know you. I'd kick you out of your mama's house, but it'd kill her. Anyway, you're going to get yourself out of the kingdom of God. I don't want your kingdom of God. I don't want any part of it. Jessie. This ain't gonna hurt. Hello there, Jessica. I brought you some plums from Shumway Springs. I've been thinking about building a new house, a big house with lots of rooms. I bet you'd like to live in a house like that, with window seats. Sit down, Jessica. Can I get you some apple juice, President King? Oh no. Gives me gas. I'm sorry you're so upset, Jessie. May be kind of hard at first, but it'll work out. I've always had a soft spot for you. I remember when you were just about this high. I don't want to marry you. We all got to do things we don't particularly want to do. I can't. Love is something that comes after you're married. You want to be a good girl and mind your mom and pop, don't you? God has spoke, Jessica. There's nothing more to say. no good acting like a baby. I hear. Now, I would appreciate it if you would try to like me. Trying. We'll get married Monday morning. I have to take fruit to Las Vegas. Bet you never thought you'd get to go to Las Vegas. She's crying. You make too much fuss. She's just so young. Spoiled her. Never did nothing for her. Was always too busy feeding everybody else. Spoiled her. How would you know? Here one night a week, not even that. Lord, can't a man get a night's rest around here? Sometimes I think plural marriage is just something men dreamed up. Seems like three wives is less than one. Good night, Mary. I don't know. Sometimes I wonder about the sense of it all. God says this and God says that and we run around like a bunch of ants. Hold me, Jay. I'm trying to get some sleep. You sleep better at Judy's? She don't nag me all night. Well maybe you just better ought to sleep there. No way to re-educate the adults. It's like taking the Amish and trying to make them Catholics. We relocate the children with their mothers and hope they're absorbed into the community. I'm not going in there without backup. Sheriff, you're authorized to deputize as many men as you want. That all right with you, Weldon? I guess. But I know how these things go. Seems neat as pie, but I'm the one that always ends up with egg on my face. Goes right, you get all the glory. Governor gets the glory if there is any. When do we move? I was thinking about this Saturday. That give you enough time, Weldon? I guess we can do it. When I take it in, it'll look real pretty. Did when I wore it. These things here on Earth are just temporal. It's life after death we have to think about. What if I love somebody else? That's nonsense. I didn't say I did. I said what if I did. The brethren wouldn't allow it. Marriage is for time and all eternity. It's serious. As God is, man will become and his wives around him in the hereafter. All we live for is dying. Just put this stuff about love out of your mind, Jessie. All you'll end up is hurting yourself. We're low on sugar. We can only have a pound. It's going to be all right. What about for you? Oh, I been through it twice before. It don't hurt so much anymore. I always cared for you. And now you're going to be my sister wife. Jessie, your stuff here. Don't be upset. It's just the way things are. Isaac. I love you, Isaac. Oh, I love you more than anything. Oh, Jessie. Jessie. I want to hold you, I want to press against you. I want to kiss you. Oh. I won't let him get you. Everything's falling apart. He said I'd understand when I grew up. Now I am but I still don't understand. We're going to run. There's no time. Day after tomorrow, Pioneer Day. Nobody will miss us during the celebration. We don't have any money. I got some from Korea. I'll get a job. Jessie, there's a life out there. I would have been long gone, but I couldn't leave without you. Don't be afraid. I'm not. I'm not. Ever been on a train? Well you're gonna. And a boat and a plane. And we're gonna do things and see things and listen and read anything we want to and laugh and go to the movies. Isaac. Jessie. You're the best person I've ever known. Isaac, you about finished? Isaac? Hold your horses, ma. Just hold your horses. Can we go? My Lord, go. Button your shirt. Make sure your suspenders aren't turned. Hurry up. Is there going to be ice cream? There's not going to be nothing if you don't hurry. Now get. Now you got this straight. Group A goes through Kingman up St. George with the sheriff. Group B through the and Fredonia. Any suggestions, Sheriff? I hear they have lookouts. They do. Signal with mirrors, I think. What if there's resistance? We're duly constituted authority. If we have to use force, we have to use force. There's women and children. I know. Weldon, don't let the men get triggered happy. I don't want any of them to fire the first shot. But if they fire, well, just try to be careful of the women and children. Careful as possible. My father came here in 1908. This was some desolate place. The Mormons didn't want us. Nobody wanted us. But we went ahead and built our houses and our reservoir, dug our ditches, and planted on our gardens. Simple people dedicated to living their lives according to God's great plan. We stand here today to honor our forefathers who gave us the courage and the fortitude and the faith to carry on. We stand here today, the real Americans, the last pioneers. Snowball. Snowball, you dumb dink. I'm going to borrow my dad's car. We'll leave it in Fredonia and he'll find it. What about mama? You'll write to her when we're safe. Trust me. I'll meet you at Hansen's ditch. Hurry. Jessica. Jessica. Come on, we're going to need a first base. Don't tell anyone. You're going. Come with us. I'm going to have a baby. I ain't going nowhere. It's OK. Put your stuff in there. Come on. Come on, get going. Damn, don't flood on me now. Come on. Everybody likes hamburgers. And malts. You got to be crazy not to like a malted milk. I stand out like a sore thumb. No, Jessie. We'll get to Flagstaff. I'll buy you a dress and a pair of shoes. Girl's shoes with little black straps. Isaac, when we get there, do we go to a motel? Don't worry. You know what they got in the motels now? Something called magic fingers. You put a dime in this machine, the whole mattress starts moving. What for? A massage. We're going to get there and you're going to get in one of them beds. I'm going to put a dime the machine. You're just going to float off to sleep.
