I wish I was like you, Stacy. Kathy! Tell your father dinner's ready, please. Okay. Hi. I'm proud to be this year's Camp Princess. My goals are to improve my riding and to help end world hunger. I would like to use my good looks to help the less fortunate, so whoever's parents donate the most to my food drive, they get to be my friend for the entire day. O.M.G., this video is going to get so many hits. It's totally going to go viral. Well, yeah. Are you kidding? Heh. Kathy! Now please! Okay! All right, let's do it again. What'd I tell you? You gotta be up on your knees, keep some daylight between your pockets. All right, who's next? There you go. Get...Oop. All right, what happened? There you go. There you go. There you go. All right. That's a good bull ride, son. good bull ride, You got off your rope a little bit there. Got you on your pockets. Yes, sir. And that videos I show you guys. You guys are gonna lift that rope a little bit, or you gonna drive that rope? Drive it. Drive it. That's right. You gotta get up in your three-point stance there, get a little bit of air between your skinny butt. Good job. Dad. Hey, princess. Mom says dinner's ready. Okay, tell her I'll be in there in 10 minutes. I don't know. Maybe homeschooling her was a bad idea. Well, you're the one that thought public school was bad for her. Everybody there made fun of her. Kids learn to brush it off. Life ain't fair. I just think she needs to make some friends her own age. How is she gonna learn to make friends when she won't even speak up for herself? I'm right here, you know. It's not her volume. It's her posture. She walks around with her shoulders slumped all the time. I can hear everything you guys are saying. Physical beauty, it's not important. Thanks, Dad. Well, maybe if she had a boyfriend. No, I'm not ready for that. Maybe I'm ready. Maybe I'm not. Anybody wonder about that? No? How is she ever going to get a boyfriend if she doesn't have the confidence to talk to people? It's what's on the inside that's important, and one day, Kathy's gonna realize that. May I be excused? What's the matter, sweetheart? You haven't touched your food. Are you sick? No, I'm not sick. I just want to be excused. Please don't put your hand on my forehea... I can't... Luke, feel her forehead. No, I... Aah! What's the matter with her? I have no idea. Kids this age, they can't just sit down and have a decent meal with their family. May I sit? You know, hon, when I was first starting rodeoing... That's all I ever hear about, when you were rodeoing. You were a bronc buster and a bull rider. Mom was a barrel racer. It's not fair. I'm 17 years old. How have I never been allowed on a horse? Honey, you know why. Bronc bucked you off and landed on your leg, and now Mom thinks that anyone who gets on a horse is gonna have an accident. Your mother just doesn't want you to end up like me. Just don't see what's so bad about you. I love you just the way you are, Dad. Heh. See, you know just... just what to say to make everybody feel good around you. Look. Listen, you're not gonna like this much at first, but I want what's best for you. Your mother and I, we were... we were talking during dinner... No kidding. and we think that you should do something this summer, something with kids your own age, and make some real friends. No. But you haven't even heard what I had to say yet. You used to love to play the violin, a-and you were good. I was nine, and you said it was bothering your bulls. I probably...I probably shouldn't have said that. I was pretty bad. No, you were... Well, yeah, you were... you were pretty bad. But if you were to spend the summer at band... No, mm-mm. So that's a no on band camp? Yeah. Yes, it is. You like art. I am not going to art camp. Well, you want to just come on the Internet with me and take a look at their website? No. No? I can't... I mean, w-what kind of girl doesn't want to go to France? I don't know. A country girl. I have everything I want right here. Sometimes it's like looking at a mirror image of myself, a vision of me coming back to haunt me. How 'bout Maine? You could spend the summer with your cousins, and it's not like they're strangers. All they're interested in is clothes and makeup. What else you got? Nothing. That's it. I'm exhausted. Can I tell you one story about my rodeoing days, though? I used to be really shy, I mean painfully shy. I didn't have no friends, nothing. I would barely even talk to anybody. Wasn't until I met Mr. Harper, and he wasn't but 19 years old at the time, too, and then we started palling around. Then I came out of my shell. This was your granddaddy's ranch... and it's be gonna be yours someday. And I never wanted to go nowhere but here, but if I didn't hit the road and go rodeoing, I... I never would've become the man that I am today. Not gonna make you do anything you don't want to do. There's a part of me that wishes you would just... stay a kid, but, uh, I know that's not gonna happen. And you're not gonna grow up just sitting around here. It's a...It's a big world out there, princess, and you've got a lot of great things to offer it. Thank you, Dad. Okay, wait. No, no, no. Don't...Don't lift on the rope. You gotta drive the rope. Get up, like a three-point stance. There you go. That's right? Yeah, yeah. Get a little bit of that daylight between your pockets. There you go. Drive that right shoulder to the bull. Right... Drive that right shoulder. There you go. Okay, good foundation. Everything in front of the rope. Now, this is muscle memory. Everything you do here on the barrel, you're gonna do the same thing when you're on the bull in the arena. Dad. Honey, Daddy's working right now. Black River Horse Camp for girls. I looked it up on the Internet. If you want me to meet new friends and meet new people, I'll go there. Your mother... Fine, then I won't. All right, good. Next rider. She's 17 years old, Kim. If horses are in her blood, then you can't stop her from riding forever. Why can't she just be interested in dresses and boys? 'Cause she's our daughter. You're not even 50, and you can't walk. Sure, I can. I just pretend when I want you to get me something. And I love you. I don't care... but it's different for a man. If a young girl has an injury like that... Look, she won't. How do you know? 'Cause I know. It's a safe camp. They wear helmets. The horses are all calm, and they only ride in saddles. She'll be fine. I don't like it. Did we come here for arguing or for kissing? Arguing. Well, I came here for kissing, so I'm just gonna take over. You do that. ♪ From coast to coast ♪ From coast to coast ♪ B.R. girls are the most ♪ B.R. girls are the most ♪ I said from coast to coast ♪ I said from coast to coast ♪ B.R. girls are the most ♪ B.R. girls are the most ♪ Na, na-na, na-na ♪ Na, na-na, na-na ♪ Na, na-na, na-na, na ♪ Na, na-na, na-na, na ♪ Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na ♪ Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na ♪ Na, na-na, na-na, na ♪ Na, na-na, na-na, na ♪ From east to west ♪ From east to west ♪ B.R. girls are the best ♪ B.R. girls are the best ♪ I said from east to west ♪ I said from east to west ♪ B.R. girls are the best ♪ B.R. girls are the best ♪ Na, na-na, na-na ♪ Na, na-na, na-na ♪ Na, na-na, na-na, na ♪ Na, na-na, na-na, na ♪ Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na ♪ Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na ♪ Na, na-na, na-na, na ♪ Na, na-na, na-na, na ♪ Na, na-na, na-na ♪ Na, na-na, na-na ♪ Na, na-na, na-na, na ♪ Na, na-na, na-na, na We're late. Sweetheart, that website said the sign-ins start at 2:30. It's only 4:00. You're gonna be here all summer. It's not gonna kill you to spend an extra hour and a half with your old man. Okay, I'm sorry. I know. I'm just nervous. I'm sorry. Listen, when you're riding, okay, I want... I want your heels down. Keep your heels down and the reins loose in your left hand. And before you even get on the horse, check the girth, okay. I don't want that saddle slipping off. But if you do start falling off that saddle, grab the horn. Now, that's not exactly what it's there for, but it will be effective, and it will do the trick, okay? Daddy. Yeah? They have riding instructors here, you know. Not like me, they don't. Hey, the only reason I got injured in the first place is 'cause I was riding bareback broncs. You're gonna be in a saddle. You make good friends with that saddle. You take care of that saddle, the saddle's gonna take care of you. I was hoping to make some actual friends. I don't mean to be Miss Popular. All you need is one good friend. Back when I was rodeoing... You and Mr. Harper used to take care of each other. I know. I guess I said that before, huh? Like a million times. I don't think you have to worry about me being Miss Popular. Princess. I love you, Dad. Have a great summer. Stay in your saddle! Okay! I love you! Excuse me. Well, hello there, cowgirl. Hi. I'm Mr. C, camp director. And you are? Kathy Muxlow. Kathy Muxlow, last but not least. Good evening, camper! Good evening. Oh, well, let's try that again. I say, "Good evening, camper!" And you say, "Good evening, Miss Jessica!" All right. So, good evening, camper! Good evening, Miss Jessica! Nice! Come on. Jerry will get the bags. I'll show you all around the camp. I'll show you horses, then goats and tell you the things in the... But Miss Linda told me... Oh, don't worry. Flag is at 5:25 sharp. Don't be late. If you're late, then you won't get treat store that night. Okay. Where's the flag? Just follow the pack. After flag, we'll have dinner. Tonight is meatless Monday, so probably grilled cheese and tomato soup. We'll see. Oh, once a week, it will be your cabin's turn to do the dishes and clean up. Sometimes you might have to pull extra clean-up duty if camp is punishing you for something, but don't worry. I won't let that happen to you. Okay. After dinner, we have night activity. Tonight is opening campfire. We also have survivor night, the talent show, The Great Escape, staff-versus-camper softball. Oh, did you bring any medicines? 'Cause if you did, then I need to take them, and then the camp nurse will give you one every day. No, I didn't. Okay, great. No cellphones. I didn't bring mine. Nice. High-five! Oh! There's small animals over there, and then there's the barn over there. There's the treat store over here. Um, small animals has, like, goats, al... There's an alpaca. ...a chapel, too, if you want it, but you don't have to go if you don't want to. Okay. Tomorrow, we start with flag, breakfast, and riding lessons in the morning. After that, it's lunch, rest hour, and free time. At free time, you can go for a trail ride, you can free ride in one of the rings, you can go to vaulting club, but if you're tired of horses... Oh, I won't get tired of horses. Well, if you do, we have volleyball, tennis, our tree trampoline, a lake and a pool. Let's see. You can play with the chickens. There's halter club, which is basically just taking nature hikes. But look! Here's your cabin. I don't think I caught all that. Don't worry. Just follow the pack. In a few days, this will all feel just natural. Thank you, Miss Jessica. Now I have a staff meeting to go to... Okay. but I'll see you at breakfast in the morning, okay? Mm-hmm. All right. Good night. Good night! See you at breakfast. Bye. Whew. Hi. I'm Kathy. Hey. Are you visiting camp or something? Huh? Like, do you have any sisters that go here or... No, don't have any sisters. Oh, my goodness! Ane, did you cut your hair? Only a few inches. It is so much cuter this way! Where can I put my stuff? Oh, are you the new girl? They said we were getting a new girl, which I thought was totally weird, because it's, like, our final year as campers. Yeah, pretty weird. So why are you here now? Well, years ago, my dad shattered his leg and... ♪ Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy? ♪ Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy? ♪ Silly and foolish the whole day through ♪ Boom, boom, ain't it great to be crazy? How are you, Stace? Oh! That one's taken. Oh, sorry. It looks empty. Yeah, I sleep on the bottom bunk, but I like to put my stuff on the top. You're Stacy. I saw your video. You ride really good. "Well." What? I ride really well. Remember, we're the future female leaders of tomorrow. Just because we ride horses, doesn't mean we're a bunch of hicks. Grammar and manners. Hey, I want to go to the wishing bridge. Does anybody want to come? Oh, I will. Let's go. Sorry about that. Oh! Sorry. I didn't realize there was anyone left in here. The bunk above mine's open. Thank you. Don't worry about them. Stacy's kind of mean in that "I'm so perfect, but I'm trying not to notice it" kind of way. The rest of 'em, they're all right when she's not around, but they're so afraid of her not liking them that they'll do anything for her. I saw a video of her last year when she won Camp Princess. Yeah. It's a big who-cares-fest. I mean, they pick the winner based on how well you ride at the final show and how many votes you get from the other girls at camp, so basically if you're the best rider and the most popular, you get to wear a crown and remind everyone that you're the best rider and you're the most popular. So you didn't vote for her? No. She is the best rider. I'll give her that, though. I remember when I was a kid, we always voted for the nicest big girl at camp. I always remember if I was having a bad day, Camp Princess would come put her crown on my little head, and everything would be all better. And now, it's just an award for being the prettiest. So you don't like it here? Are you kidding me? I love it here. I mean, don't get me wrong. We could use a real Camp Princess again, but other than Stacy, this place is great.

You start with this brush. You work it in circles over the main areas, mostly under the saddle. Next, we move to the hard brush. Short strokes and a small flicking action. When you're done with that, just use the soft brush in the exact same way. All right, I'll come back in a few minutes and show you how to pick the hooves. Oh, and then saddle and bridle. Miss Jessica. Yes? How come no one's riding that one? Ah, that's Sundance. He's beautiful, but he's a brat, won't let anyone near him, won't let anyone even ride him. I don't know why Mr. C even bought him. Hey. Okay. Great! Do you know how to lead? I think so. Just take him by the lead rope. Stay on his left side. You'll be all right. Okay. Go ahead and take him down to ring number six. The rest of your cabin should already be there. Thanks. Oh, hey, new rider. First day? Yep. Welcome, welcome. Go ahead, bring him in, and then I'll help you get on. Perfect. All right. I'll take your leg and help you get on. Ready? 1, 2, 3. Hut! All right. Awesome. Good job, cowgirl.

Wow, she's really good. She's a natural. She's not that good. No, she's really good. You already said that, Marissa. There's no need to repeat yourself. Good job. Yeah, keep it coming. I'll give you a red light when I'm ready. Good. Right about there. Red light! Kathy, what are you doing? Kathy, red light! Kathy, red light! Kathy! Kathy! Okay, girls, rest hour's over! Everybody out, out, out! Free time till flag at 5:25 sharp! Everybody, we're going to the Opera House to practice. Practice for what? The talent show. Well, what are we doing? Oh, um, it's a song on the Titanic, but the seven of us are already set. You understand, don't you? Well, maybe the two of you can cheer for us. Yeah, or maybe we won't. I don't know why you insist on acting like that, Lisa. Everybody out! Let's go, girls! Marissa, wake up! wake up! Keilah, come on, honey. Get down. Let's go, girls. Let's go. Let's go. Kathy, you're on pots and pans tonight. Why? When you're in the riding ring, red light means red light. Sorry. Did you have fun, at least? Good, but red light means red light, okay? Okay. Okay. Now, get your little behinds out of my cabin. Miss Jessica. Ahh! What? Can I do pots and pans with Kathy tonight? But tonight is turn your counselor into ice cream Sunday night. You're gonna miss it. That's okay. I'd rather just hang out with Kathy. Fine. You're both on pots and pans. Now out of my cabin! Okay, okay. Okay. Out of my cabin! Thank you. Okay, go, go, go, go, go! Trail ride? Okay, yeah. What? Yeah, I learned a new camp song, by the way, P.I. When you're done, they go on a rack to dry. Next, you wipe down all the tables with a clean, wet rag. Then finally it's time to mop and brush the floor. Buckets are in the utility room. I'll be back at 8:30 to see how you did. Do a good job. If you don't do a good job, you just have to come back tomorrow night and do it again. So what did you guys do? I texted. Same. We texted each other. I didn't stop for red light. I missed flag. I was chewing gum. I didn't know it could get stuck in a horse's hoof and hurt them. I was really sorry. Aw, honey. And now I'm missing turn your counselor into an ice cream Sunday night. And everybody else is missing pots and pans. We're gonna have so much fun. Are you guys ready to have fun?

Okay, wow. Look at her hair. She's beautiful. She's not that good-looking. No, she's even better-looking than you are. Is...That's Sundance. Okay, just, oh, my God. Go, Kathy! Come on! Whoo! Kathy, how did you learn how to ride Sundance like that? That was amazing. I snuck out of the cabin and worked with him every night. Oh, I love your shirt. Thank you. Your hair is so pretty. I wish my hair would flow like that. I have a top that would look really cute on you. You can borrow all my clothes if you want, and we can be like sisters. Hey, why don't you come to the talent show with us tonight and sing with us? Yes. We are doing the Titanic. Actually, that song works better with seven than it does eight. I agree. Oh, good. So I think it would be best, Stacy, if you sat this one out. You understand, right?

He was really tall, like 17 hands if you wanted to put 'em all together. Hi, Kathy! Hi, girls. Anyways... I think I'm gonna skip our trail ride today. Um, okay. I told some of the other girls I'd play tennis with them. You told me that we'd go riding together today, but all right. That's fine. Apparently, Red, he was... Hi, Kathy! You look pretty today. Oh, thank you. Are you even listening to me? Yeah, you're telling ne about the time Miss Jessica trained a horse named Red. No, it wasn't Miss Jessica. It was Miss Katy, and she wasn't training the horse. It was actually a story about the time that she saw a ghost of a horse. A ghost of a horse? Really, Lisa? Come on. Okay, I'm late for tennis. Love you. Love... Yeah, great. Thanks. Whoo! Swing your weight. Nice. That was great. Let's do it. Put it up! Come on, Ane. Get it! get it! You got it. You got it. You! You got it? Get it! Get it! Yeah! Ohh. Gosh. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whose stuff is on my bed? What is going on here? Why is all my stuff on the floor? Hello? Anyone? We just kind of thought that Kathy could use more space. Who's "we"? Um... all of us. You've got to be kidding me. Are you kidding me?! I've known you all for 10 years! Great! Great! Now, where am I supposed to sleep, hmm? What, I'm supposed to sleep with Lisa now? Yeah, it's a real picnic for me, too. Ugh! Okay, so there's two categories when it comes to being Camp Princess. First of all, you have been the best rider. Every year, at the end of summer camp, we have a competition. If you are nominated for Camp Princess, you get to go in, and you get to compete and show off all your horse skills. Mr. C and some other staff members are gonna be the ones to judge. Okay. How do I get nominated? Oh, well, that's the second part. So it's only the nicest girls that are eligible, who have the best camp spirit, and Beth and I already nominated you. I did, too. Marissa, just be quiet. Heh. Sorry about her. So anyway, all we need now is 50 signatures. That seems like a lot. Are you kidding me? You're, like, the most popular girl here at camp. I could go during free time and get it all by myself. It'd be so easy. Thank you. There is one thing, though. Stacy's automatically already going to be competing, because she was Camp Princess last year, and she's a pretty good rider. The most important thing is confidence. A horse can feel how confident a rider is on his back You know, a lot of horses will try to push you around, go where they want to go, put their head down when they eat whenever they feel like it, you know, that kind of thing, but you have to be nice to a horse, but also firm. A lot of the horses that would try to push one of you around, for example, would never even try it with me on his back. A horse can really just sense the ability of their rider. Can you pass the cereal, please? Stacy, honey, you really think a second bowl's a good idea? I mean, I know things haven't been going great for you lately, but you can't eat your way to happiness. Just remember, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips. I'm gonna go see Moses and the other miniature horses at free time today if you want to come. Yeah, sounds good. Sure. Oh. It's just that, you know, you haven't seen Moses in a really long time, and he's gonna... Yeah, okay, Lisa, I said yes, so... Anyway, what was I talking about? Horses can sense who's riding them. Right, okay. So take Sundance, for example. He won't let anyone else ride him, but when I'm on his back, he becomes a perfect little peace horse. Hi, Miss Tara. Hey, Lisa. Where's Kathy? She'll be here in a few minutes. Two peas in a pod. Yeah, I guess. Trouble in paradise? No. I don't even know why I said that. Moses is looking really old. Yeah, he is. He's... He's what? Nothing. I can't talk about it with campers. I'm only a few years younger than you, Tara. It's Miss Tara, and that's true, but you're still a camper, and I'm still a counselor, so... Fine. I'm glad you're here, actually. I wanted to talk to you about something. Oh, yeah? What's that? Camp Princess. It's either gonna be Kathy or Stacy, so I don't know what there is to talk about. What about you? What about me? As Camp Princess. Heh heh. Yeah, right. I'm serious. Okay, well, let's start here. I'm an average rider at best, so even if I could get nominated, I wouldn't get the riding competition part. I have a theory, actually. Why do I think I'm gonna hear about this? I don't think Mr. C judges on the best rider. When his dad started the camp competition years ago, he did it to honor the girl who best represents Black River. Yeah, we're here for the horses of course, but that's not all that camp's about. You make people feel welcome, Lisa. You're kind to everybody. You should be our Camp Princess. Yeah, well, thank you, but I don't think I quite fit the mold for the signatures. I doubt 50 girls here even know my name. Never know till you try. Yeah. Where is Kathy? I don't know. She's late. He's got something right here, too. Come on. You got this. All right. Good! Good job! Good job. All right. Really good. Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Which one of these shirts do you think I should wear tonight? I don't know. Hold 'em up higher. Doesn't help. Neither of 'em have the slogan "Leaves best friend behind all day by herself" written in big words. What are you talking about? We were supposed to spend free hour today with the miniature horses. We were? Yep. When did we talk about that? At breakfast. I don't remember that. Okay. Well, can you remember this? Tomorrow we're gonna go riding, just you and me like we used to, okay? Okay, yeah. Sounds fun. I won't forget. I promise. Now, will you help me pick out a shirt? Definitely the blue one. Yeah? Yes. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. You ready? Yeah, but where's your saddle? I'm gonna ride bareback today. I don't think that's a very good idea. I've been riding for a long time, Kathy. Yeah, but... What, I'm not as good as a rider as you? That wasn't what I was gonna say. It's true, though. I've been riding every summer for the last nine years, and this is your first summer, and you're so much better than I am. Lisa, it's not a competition. Isn't it, though? Camp Princess, isn't it a competition? Lisa. Look, I'm sorry. Let's just ride like we used to, okay? What should I do for the talent show next year? What do you mean "I"? Me, Kathy, what should I do for the talent show? You're gonna do our cabin's next talent show all by yourself? Okay, what should we do for the talent show next year? What do you mean "we"? I don't think I understand. Well, last time, you didn't include me. It's not like that, Lisa. Well, what's it like, then? I mean, talent show is just kind of not your thing. Well, I wouldn't know, because you didn't include me last time, and you excluded Stacy, too. Since when do you care about Stacy? Stacy is a camper at Black River, and I care about all the campers here. But she was never nice to you, Lisa. Maybe not, but I was always nice to her, and I was always nice to you, too. I know. Do you? 'Cause for the last three weeks, you haven't been that nice to me. Well, maybe you're just jealous. What was that? I said you're just jealous. Yeah, that must be it. Look, do you want me to say it? Fine! I'll say it. I am a better rider than you, and I'm prettier than you are. There it is. Do you feel good? Are you happy now? Whatever. I don't care what you look like, and by the way, you're ugly now, and you used to be so much prettier. Well, that's not what everyone else says. They're blind. And by the way, you're wrong. I'm not jealous of your looks, and I don't care that you're a better rider than I am. You used to be my friend, and now you're not, and that hurts. I don't like the new you, and I don't want to be your friend anymore. Well, I guess you won't have any friends then. Guess I won't. Have fun being a fake popular little princess. Come on, Magic. Okay, so the game is very simple. All you do is pick from three guys. You're gonna pick the one that you want to kiss, the one that you want to marry, and there's one that you want to punch in the face, okay? Mm, let's see here. Justin Bieber... Ben Affleck... and, oh, Taylor Lautner. Ben Affleck is old. I'm kissing him. Ugh, no. I'm punching Ben Affleck and kissing Justin Bieber. But his beard is so hot. No, it's not. Seriously, Kathy? Okay, okay. And then marry. Tough one, right? Mm, let's see here. Taylor Lautner. How'd you know? He's hot. Hey, girls, I have some bad news. Lisa was out riding her horse bareback in the field today, and she fell off and broke her arm. She's in town getting it taken care of, but she's gonna be gone for a few days. And new camp rule, no one else is allowed to ride bareback this summer. What? That's not fair. Just 'cause Lisa can't ride. I don't make the rules. Talk to Mr. C. I'll see you at dinner. I was just with her. Yeah, it's so sad. Okay, so Channing Tatum, Zayn Malik, and, mm... Mm, that's a tough one. Who else? I like the last one. Kathy, where are you going? Wait, do you want us to come with you? Hey, princess, what are you doing? I'm ugly. You? You couldn't be ugly if you tried. Yes, I am. Look at me. I am looking at you, sweetheart, and you are beautiful. No, I'm not. Honey, it's what's inside that really counts. You know, all those popular girls, they're the ugly ones. You are the most beautiful girl in the whole world, and some day, some young man is gonna come along, and he's gonna treat you just like the princess that you are. And you know what I'm gonna do? What? I'm probably gonna wring his little neck. But if he's good to you, then eventually, I guess I'll grow to love him, too. Someday, the entire world is gonna see how beautiful you are. Thanks, Dad. Mm. Hi, Kathy. Hi, Kathy. Hi. You look pretty today. Oh, thank you. I wish I was like you, Stacy. Have fun being a popular, fake, little princess. I don't like the new you, and I don't want you to be my friend. Hey, Kathy. Hi. Uh-oh. Not a happy camper, huh? Today's not my best day. You want to talk about it? Could you bring out Moses? I just want to pet him for a little while. Moses? Kathy... Kathy, the vet put Moses down three days ago. I'm sorry. I thought Lisa had told you. She was here with him at the end. You haven't been back to visit in a couple weeks. I'm sorry. Kathy, you know the policy. You can't leave the campgrounds, period. But I just want to go to the hospital. She's my best friend. I just...I want her to know. Kathy. But you could change the policy. It's your camp. It's your policy! Yes, it is my policy. Haven't you ever had a best friend? Uh, I need to be there for her. I wasn't there for her before, and I... Look, please, Mr. C. It isn't that simple. What isn't that simple? My parents would let me go. We could call them right now. Kathy, she doesn't want to see you. It's not about the policy, Kathy. Lisa doesn't want to see you, and I'm going to respect that. Look, summer isn't over yet. I've seen this happen before. Whatever happened between the two of you, you still have time to set things right. ♪ Announcements, announcements, announcements ♪ The counselors have another one ♪ Another one, another one ♪ The counselors have another one ♪ They have 'em all the time ♪ Announcements ♪ Announcements, announcements ♪ Here's the counselors ♪ Dah-dah, dah-dah, charge! This morning's announcements will be brought to you by camper Tory! Today, Squaws will go to the barn, and Chiefs will go to breakfast. Trail ride is for Mohawk, but there will be no bareback riding. Aww. Aww. Girls, it's still gonna be a great day at camp. Lisa! Hi. You're back. Broke my arm. I didn't die of malaria. I know. I just... Your bunk is still empty. I'm staying with the staff for the last week at camp. But... I can't ride, so Mr. C is letting me help out with the younger kids. That's really nice of you. Lisa... Don't. It's okay. You don't want to be friends with someone like me. I don't know what you mean when you say someone like you. Yes, you do. You know exactly what I mean. I'm not thin. I'm not popular, not the kind of person you wanted to hang out with, and that's okay. I'm not mad. I'm trying to help out with the little kids. Will you please let me get back to doing that? But... Goodbye, Kathy. But you're my best friend. Kathy, let's go. Chop-chop, girl. To the ring. I don't really want to... Kathy? Can I just take Sundance and go out in the fields for a while? Yes, during afternoon free time, but right now, it's time for your riding lessons, and Miss Katy is waiting for you. Fine. Go on. All you need is one good friend. We got an hour till lights out. Do you want me to show you around? I think I love it here. That's okay, I'd rather just hang out with Kathy. Just once I'd like to know what it's like to be pretty and popular and have everybody like you. And again, I like you. Perfect. Yeah! Summer isn't over yet. I've seen this happen before. Whatever happened between the two of you, you still have time to set things right. If you do something wrong, you gotta swallow your pride and make it right. Everybody is gonna make mistakes. I mean, you get down on your hands and knees if you have to, okay. Do not let your pride get in the way of keeping your friend. Practicing for the show? Just riding. You've been nominated for Camp Princess, Kathy. You want to win, don't you? Nope. Too bad. Odds are Stacy is gonna be Camp Princess again then. That's the way it should be. It's Stacy's camp. This camp is amazing, Kathy. So many girls have the best summers of their lives here. Wouldn't it be great if they all could? I ruined Lisa's summer. She would've been a lot better off if she hadn't been so nice to me. Well, you know, Camp Princess gets to make a speech at the final bonfire. If you win, you can say anything you want. Like what? That's for Camp Princess to decide. Last week of camp. Have a great time, and remember, only one week till our year-end show. If you've been nominated for Camp Princess, practice, practice, practice. Camp Princess gets to make a speech at the final bonfire. If you win, you can say anything you want. Stacy is the best rider at camp. There's no denying that. I ruined Lisa's summer. This camp is amazing, Kathy. So many girls have the best summers of their lives here. I wanted Black River to give me the summer I'd always dreamt of. There's some strong philosophy in that statement. Hey, guys. I'm gonna take a boat out onto the lake. Anybody wants to come, they can. You, too, Stacy. Kathy wants to go play on her boat, let her. We're gonna practice, and we're gonna win. Hi, Kathy. Hey, girls. You having a good summer? Yeah. What are you doing? Feeding the chickens. And hiding from Melinda. Why would you do that? Because she talks funny. Melinda talks funny because she wears hearing aids. She doesn't hear quite as well as we do, and it affects her voice. Melinda's my friend, and if you guys want to be my friend, too, then you should be nice to her. Do you want to be my friend? Then you should go find Melinda and invite her to feed the chickens with you. Bye, Kathy.

Yours is going to drive you home in a beat-up old pickup. You know, you're right. That doesn't matter to me at all. Well, break a leg. That's my daughter out there. She's only seven years old. All right, what a show these cowgirls have put on for us today. Let's have a big round of applause for our Black River girls! You know, folks, every year, we give a lot of awards to our girls for their achievements. We give out an award for best spirit, most improved, most helpful, and about a dozen or so other great awards. But also, each year, we give out a very special award to our top camper. Are you all ready to choose our next Camp Princess? First, we have Carol on Ernie. Next, we have Jennifer on Blizzard. Let's have a big hand for Ashley on Powell. Now, it's time for Julia on Rain. Now, it's time for Stacy on Baron. Next is Amber riding Shadow. Hey. Hey, are you ready? Yep. We're gonna ride like the wind, aren't we, Sundance? Kathy, just go have fun. The competition's over. What do you mean? I haven't ridden yet. Stacy's ride was flawless. She's better than most the staff. Your routine isn't difficult enough, and even if you did it perfectly, she'd probably still win. So you might as well just go have fun, okay? Not difficult enough, huh? Luke, there's no saddle on that horse. Kathy, get down! Get off the horse! She'll be fine. She'll be fine. Relax. You don't know that. Relax. Where's her saddle? I don't know. I don't allow bareback riding here anymore. I know. I told them. She had a saddle on the horse just a few minutes ago. She could get hurt. Hey, good job, Kath! Ladies and gentlemen, I don't think there's any doubt about it. Let's have a big hand for our new Camp Princess, Miss Kathy Muxlow! Oh, my. Way to go, Kath! I am just so proud of all of you girls. This truly has been a magical summer. I hope that all of you come back as campers next year, you older girls as counselors. And for any of you counselors who won't make it back next year, please, please, please, please remember that we are the future female leaders of tomorrow. Take all of the lessons that you've learned here at Black River and send that love out all across the world. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Now, I know who you really want to hear from, so here she is, your Camp Princess, Kathy Muxlow. Years ago, I asked my family if I could have a horse. Wow, I'm sorry. I'm not used to talking in front of everyone like this. Um... I actually wrote a speech. I've been working on it for the last week, but, um, I'm just going to talk. When I first came here, I wanted Black River to give me the summer I'd always dreamt of. I wanted to be with horses, and I wanted friends, and I never thought about how it's just as much up to me and all of us to make this place great as it is to Mr. C and the counselors. It's up to us to have the best summer of our lives, and if we're all just nice to each other, then we'll all be happy. I hope that I made Black River better for all of you, but I don't really think that I did. Stacy, I'm sorry I was mean to you. I really am. You're such a good rider, and I wanted to be just like you. But it turns out that you're a lot like me. I get jealous, and I worry about what people think about me. And you hurt me, but I shouldn't have tried to hurt you back. And I hope that somehow you like me, because I actually really like you and I want to be your friend. And I'm sorry that you didn't win. I know it was important to you, and I think that you're wonderful. But the truth is that you didn't deserve to be Camp Princess this year, and neither do I. There's a girl here who deserves this so much more than I do. Lisa... you're just good. You're so much better than I am. And I spent so much time trying to be popular and trying to be something that I'm not, I should have been spending all of my time trying to be more like you. You're such a good friend, and you're so much prettier than I am. And even if you don't want to be my friend anymore, please, please say that you'll come back and be staff next year because you are exactly the kind of girl that Black River deserves, and I wish that I could be more like you. And here. Here. I want to give you this. I forgive you. I miss my best friend.
