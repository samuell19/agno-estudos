May I inquire as to when this delightful photograph was created? Geez, that's gotta be 17, 18 years ago You haven't changed a bit, Michael. And you need glasses, Gabe. You seen bossman? Indeed. Mr. Jones is anxiously awaiting your arrival inside the establishment. You're looking dapper this morning, Mr. Jones. Army! Where the fuck have you been? Get this cooler loaded. You gonna get that? If you're not. We open at noon. It's 10 after. Where are the facilities? It's colder than a well digger's ass in here. You know, I asked you to be here on the time. I've got a meeting tomorrow. Yeah, I know, but what happened- - But nothing. You know, if you didn't draw people into here, I would've fired you a long time ago. - Hey, Daddy. - Hey, Jenny. Thanks for filling in. It's hard to find good help. Hello, Jenny. You know, that's the third time this week you've been late. How am I supposed to run a business like this? You know, that's it. One more fuckup and you're outta here. You got that? One more fuckup. Yes, master. I can do better, master. Don't whip me, master. I can do better. And stay away from my daughter. She doesn't want anything to do with you Yes, master. I'll stay away from your daughter, master. I'll stay away. What's up, shit stabber? Son of a... Jen, we need to talk. Come on, you can't be serious about this guy. That is none of your business Cut me some slack. Cut you some slack? Are you kidding me Ha, not again. You're right, not again, 'cause I don't care anymore. Fuck. Can I get a Tom Collins? Yeah. You want a tampon with that? Okay. How about a ginger ale? I'll take a water. No ice, please. My name's... Jen, be reasonable. He's not the guy you think he is. Just out of my way. I'm telling you, he's a player. I've seen him at the clubs. He makes me look like Boy George with erectile dysfunction. Whatever! He is a better man than you'll ever be. Me? Are you kidding me? Just drop it, Michael! Who pissed in her Wheaties? Son of a... Murray, come here. I need favor. What? Go over to my house, find Coop. He got out again. Man, I got shit to do today. You're a fucking dishwasher, and a shitty one at that. Look, clean it up and go. Wait. I can't. Why not? I don't have a car. Just take, take mine. The keys are in it. And here. Fill her up. Be careful. It's a classic. But I don't know how to drive. Army! You seen the bartender? Ugly guy? He's in the back. Army, get your ass out here! Hey, Bobby, what's up? Don't give me that shit. Answer your goddamn phone. I left it at home. Well, would you look at that? Son of a... Read this. Got faxed to me by the league this morning. Yeah. You've been suspended for 200 games. Two fucking hundred. 200? Why? Well, let's think about this. You're the first guy to get into a fight on your own bench with your own coach on national television. He's a fucking asshole, and you know I You know what, he's a fucking asshole with a broken jaw. You're lucky he doesn't sue you. Yeah, but 200 games? Look, you took a shit on the hood of the owner's car. And you put Viagra in the visitors' water bottle. You fucked the CEO's daughter Hey, it was his granddaughter. Hey, are you listening to me? What's your point? That's a termination letter. I'm terminating our agreement. What? Look, Colorado, they're gonna cut you, and nobody's gonna wanna pick up your contract. All right? You're done. Well, I heard Dallas- - No, stop it. I cannot be your agent anymore. You're damaged goods. You've been my agent since I was 19. Army. Think of this as a wake-up call. Get your shit together. My shit? Yeah. I mean, look at you. You're outta shape, you're immature, and you're a goddamn drunk. Look out, I got a baby on deck, and I think it's coming breach. Ew! Come on! Ah! You're unreliable and you're homophobi You smell like dog food. Look, life's not all coke and pussy, Arm - I gotta move on. - Hey, thanks for telling me I had a dick on my... I see things have changed. Hey, Jen. Oh, hey, Scott. How is your day progressing, Michael? Was Mr. Jones upset by your tardiness? Yeah, but that's the least of my problems. Do tell. Well, Coop's loose again, Jen won't talk to me, and my agent dropped me like a fucking T-Mobile call. A most eventful day thus far, wouldn't you say? Yeah, I guess. I shouldn't be here anyway, man. I'm a hockey player, not a bartender. Ice hockey is a young man's endeavor. You, my aging friend, are well into the twilight of your caree Sooner or later you must find a less taxing profession. Things just used to be easier, though. I mean, I'd get up, play hockey, party, go to the next town, get up, play hockey, party. Things just got complicated. Indeed they do, Michael. The knowledge and experience one gathers over time typically prepares them for a mature adulthood. Well, not me brother. I'm as free as the luggage on Southwest. Life's good. Your day indicates otherwise, Michael. But I respect your fortitude. Onward, young man. Thanks, Gabe. Our talks always, uh, make me feel better, man. Most enriching persiflage, Michael. Most enriching. Thank you for using the ashtray. That one's on me. Who's that asshole? I don't know. What happened to you last night, bud. Last I saw you were doing a line off that GILF's ass. GILF? Grandma. Took her back to the stabbin' cabin. Got some strange. Shit got weird. That's definitely PT, bud. PT? Past talent. Now, what is it with you and redheads, bud? That chick was older than my granny. Pussy's pussy, my friend. Eh. I don't mean to eavesdrop, but I have to disagree with you. Army, is it? Yeah. I've been married for over 25 years. I love my wife. I view her as much more than a sexual object. There's an intellectual connection that every healthy couple enjoys. Thanks, Dr. Phil. You gonna send me to Malibu now? It's that intellectual connection that's kept me loyal all these years. I spent a lotta time on the road, and believe me, I had chances. I bet you've had a lot of opportunities, huh? What do you do, bud? I'm, uh, I'm in sales. Really? I'm an out-of-work gynecologis - Really? - Yeah. Just looking for the right opening. About freaking time. Hey, come here. I wanna talk to you real quick. Let go of me. - Stop! Get off of me! - Hey, just relax. - What the fuck? - Stop! Get your hands off of me! Stop it. I take it you're a friend of his? Best friends. Hey, what's up there, little guy? Little guy? Fuck you. - Fuck me? - Yeah. Do you know who you're talking to? Yeah, I know who I'm talking to, Dickstrong. Fucking washed-up, Pillsbury Dough-looking motherfucker that can't play anymore. That's why you're riding pine, right? Yeah, I've seen you play. You think you're a tough guy, wearing a helmet and your little gloves? You're just a big, fat pussy. All right. Knock it off, otherwise I'll take you ou You? Take me out where, on a date? We're going on a date, you and me? I don't think so. You fucking has-been. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Go to sleep, Frodo. Where'd that guy go? Doctor's appointment. Really? Yeah. Could you believe that asshole? Mm-hmm. Eh, shit. Beer? I'm, I'm pregnant. Oh, right, right, yeah. Tequila? Could I just have water, please? Sure. How old do you think she is? Eh, 16, 17. Definitely FT. FT? Let me guess. Future talent? This guy gets it. Well, that's way too young to be a mother. Are you kidding me? She's a total smoke show. I mean, safe as they come, too. She's already pregnant. There's no way she's 18, bud. That's a guideline, not a rule. Uh, actually, it's a law. Well, you know what I always say. Before you attack her, wrap your whacker Cover your stump before you hump. Sheath that knife. She ain't your wife Cover your diddle before you fiddle that middle. Don't be silly. Protect your willy. - Huh? - Oh! I'm beginning to like this guy. 10 bucks. Just kidding. Water's only three bucks. Oh. Jesus, water's free. This ain't Flint. Ah, fuck. Dick. It's Rich, asshole. I think the gay bar's up the road. If I were gay, I wouldn't be humping J twice a day, now would I? I've been meaning to ask you, how do you like my sloppy seconds? Hey, Richie. Hey, precious. I'll get you a drink while you set up. Okay, pumpkin. Oh my God. You're jealous, Armstrong. Jealous of you? I don't think so. Ah, Rogaine doesn't seem to be kicking in, does it? Listen here, Army. You do us all a favor and stay away from Jen. She doesn't want anything to do with you All righty, then. Soon, I'll get her outta this place, away from your shit. Okay, Dick. Nobody's buying this good guy routine. I know what kind of fuck monkey you are, and soon, so will Jen. Yes. Sorry, buddy. You lose. I win. Take it like a man. Geez, Dick. I'm gonna rip your head off and piss down your throat. Hmm, you might wanna be careful with that temper, Armstrong. You might still be in the league. Hey, let him go, buddy. Let him go. Yeah. Yeah, listen to your buddy, Gilligan. Is everything all right, guys? Everything's fine, honey. Okay. So I was in the islands in '79 with Bob Marley. Dude reaches into his pocket, pulls out a fatty jay. We smoked that thing for, like, hours. I was really high, but so clear. I pulled out a pen. I wrote "One Love" in, like, five minute Marley pulls out his guitar, and we're just jamming on the beach. I was so baked. I completely forgot about it. I left the napkin with the lyrics on Marley's coffee table. The rest is history. Yeah. So, like, are you gonna buy something? I need something strong. - Strong? - Really strong. Really strong? How about the pre-rolled? It's gonna be a mix between Blue Kush and Hawaiian Ballsack. We call it Blue Balls, other than the fact that it doesn't leave you hanging. And two hits of that, you're gonna be feeling like Willie Nelson on 420, if you know what I mean. I'll take six of these. Make it seven. And, uh, I'll take one of those, a pack of those, an ounce of that, a half ounce of that, the pipe that looks like a caterpillar, the hermit crab over there. Aw! That bong looks sick. Yeah. That's the Johnny Menzel Powertoke. That's a good eye, my friend. I'll take it. You have been most excellent, my man. Throw in 10 bucks for yourself. Thanks, man. Hey, where are you going? I need a courtesy wipe. Your toilet paper feels more like sandpaper. Fuck that, I need your help to prove to Jen he's just another asshole. Rich? No, he's okay. He's not okay, idiot. He's just another douchebag. I just found out he fucked like three of my teammates' wives. Three! So? So? So I need to prove to Jen that he's a fucking shallow dickhead, just like me It's my only hope. Hope? Of what? Getting her back. Oh no, bud. There's no hope of that. Fuck. Holy shit. Look at that redhead. She's got the ass of an eighth-grade boy I hate when you say that, bud. Hey, ladies. How are we doing? Hey, can I get you guys something to drink? Pitcher of margaritas. Aw, girl! Last night being single. One pitcher of margs. Hey, that's perfect. Get your jaw off the floor, loser. Oh, look at the bombs on that blonde. Yeah. Fucking racking. Ah, shit. Where's that, where is that bartender? - Yeah. - Oh my gosh Hey, now, remember, no means yes then. Then yes means anal. You think I'm stupid? Go get 'em, tiger. Hey, ladies. Welcome to Mudrock's. I'd like to take your picture. Yeah. I wanna show Santa what I want for Christmas. Uh. Just kidding. Pitcher's on the house. Hey, you see my friends over there? They want your number so they know where they can find me in the morning. Congratulations, by the way. Ow! Oh! Oh yeah. Okay. Semen in you later. Smooth. What did you say? I just asked her if she wanted to go halfsies on a bastard child. And that didn't work? I don't know. They're losers. Sorry to interrupt you guys. What the hell? Oh yes. Too easy. I'm gonna destroy that asshole. That's gay. Goddamn camel humpers. Probably suicide bombers or something. Well, that's not racist. I don't care. You know, they wipe their ass with their left hand. That's not exactly true. In reality, Scott, the vast majority of Muslims suffer more violence and terrorism than non-Muslims. In fact, over 90% of Muslims don't suppo the extremist views of terrorism. Believe what you want. My uncle served three tours in Iraq. He saw it first hand. This guy sucks. He sounds like Nirvana and Pearl Jam fucked a Muppet. Hey, he's really good. Yeah. Everyone, make sure you tip the hot bartender, who this next song goes out to. And it's not that fat fuck behind the ba It's Jen.

Yeah, and I'm Caitlyn Jenner. What can I get you guys? Two Hazed. I was on the tail of a KGB agent in Birmingham, the UK. I was in an Aston Martin. Great cars, by the way. I highly recommend one, if you have the means. And suddenly, a helicopter lowered these two ninjas into my backseat. Excuse me. Murray here. Hey, Murray, where the fuck are you, man? I'm on it, Army. I almost got him. Where is he? I'll have him back in the bar licking his nuts before you can say peanut butter Thursda Bring Coop now! Chill out. I'm on it. Where was I? Oh yeah. These Russians in my backseat. One of 'em was a chick. Hot, like Maria Sharapova. Except, a real Russian, not from Florida Anyway, they've got guns to the back of my head. Do you know what I do?

What? I'm trying to work. He's not the guy you think he is. Listen. He treats me well. He holds the door open for me. He brings flowers. He's everything you're not. I used to hold the door open for you. Yeah, sure, when you could stand. Half of the time, you were passed out drunk. Come on. Look, he loves me. Okay? We go on picnics together. We have doggie play dates. Doggie play dates? Now I know he's gay. Just drop it. Please. Jen. I didn't wanna tell you this, but I saw him get that girl's number over there. What girl? The one at the bachelorette party. Hey, honey. Hey, I'm sorry to bother you with this, but he said you got a girl's number from over there. A number? Yeah. I saw you, joker. Oh, this? The bachelorette party wanted me to play a few songs. That coulda happened to anybody. Sorry, honey. Fuck. Michael, I sense a level of frustration. Is the day getting away from you? It's my... It's Jen. Hmm, yes? She fucking hates me. When one door closes, my good friend, another door opens. We often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the ones which now stand open. All my doors are closing. My career, my girl, my life. Michael, your mind is a powerful thing. When you fill it with positive thoughts, your life will follow suit. She's dating this complete a-hole. She thinks he's great, but he's, he's no good for her. As the great poet Francois de La Rochefoucauld once wrote, "Absence diminishes small loves and increases great ones, as the wind blows out the candle but lights the bonfire." Yeah, I guess. Maybe. Look, I gotta get back to work. - So creepy. - Can you believe it? - She had red hair. - Look how cute this is. This is amazing. - Oh, do that one. - That one, for sure. Oh my gosh. Hey, Army. Hi, Charlie. I wanted my mom to meet you. Oh, hi, Charlie's mom. It's Sally. Nice to meet you. Charlie can't stop talking about you. Really? I was wondering if you'd sign my jerse I thought you were an Oshie fan? Not anymore. Hey. Hey. Is that your friend over there? Yeah. Why is he signing that jersey for that little kid? 'Cause he's Mike Armstrong. The famous hockey player? That's Mike Armstrong? Yeah. Okay, can I go now? I got a like a racist horse. Thanks. Dad's not gonna believe it. Hey, we got an open table back there, if you guys would like to stay. We got great wings. Can we, Mom? Sure, honey. Hey, listen, as soon as you get out of that chair, why don't we get on the ice together? I could show you a few you things. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good. Can I talk to you in private? Sure. I just wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart. She gets picked on a lot and- - Don't mention it. It was nothing. Hey, Army, whose dick do I have to suck to get a beer around here? You better get back to your customers. We'll get something to eat. All right. Can I have everyone's attention, pleas Everyone, be quiet. That goes for you guys playing foosball in the back. Jen. Baby. Can you, uh, come up to the stage, pleas What the fuck? Jen, uh, we've been together for over a month now What'll it be? I wanna spend the rest of my life with you. Uh, your best bourbon. Neat. Will you make me the happiest man on Earth? Will you marry me? Are you kidding me? Yes. Hey, all right. Another? Rum and Coke. - Look at that. - I'm so happy. Dang, look at the size of that rock. I know, it's great. Yeah, no, actually, I didn't pay for that. What the fuck is going on here? I'll be out back. That was amazing. Yeah. Army's having a tough time today, huh? That might send him over the edge, but... So what's the backstory on Army and Je They dated for a few years. Lived together for a while. Army was in the show back then, so he traveled a lot. What happened? Army got a serious problem with redheads. A serious problem. I've never seen anything like it. He goes apeshit for anything with red hair and a set of cans. Huh. Jen comes home early from the bar one night. Army's in the hot tub with two redheads. A mother-daughter deal. Found 'em at Walgreens in the sunscreen aisle. Oh, that makes sense. About a week later, Jen gets the cable bill. Super expensive. Apparently Army ordered like 10 porn movies. "Ginger Snatch," "Nobody Does It Redder," "Red Boss." But Jen's not a redhead. Actually, she is. She went blonde after they split. - Really? - Yup. Then Jen moved out a few days later, and Army's never been the same since. Smoking will let me prove to shorten the days in which you exist, Michael. I know. I wish I never existed. Nonsense. You are a young man. You have a long and fruitful life ahead of you. It doesn't matter. I'm gonna be alone. Rich proposed to Jen. She said yes. She actually accepted. Apparently you don't know Jen as well as you think you do. Yeah, I guess not. It doesn't matter anyway, though. It's done. She's gone. I'm fucked. Sometimes all a woman wants is to see you fight for her. It gives her confidence that you want the relationship as much as she does. Yeah, I guess that makes sense, huh? Where's the boy that left home alone at 14 years of age to pursue his hockey career? Right here. And where's the young man everyone's said was too small and too slow to be successful? Right here. And where's the man who worked his derriere off in order to prove everyone wrong? Right here. Then go in there, Michael, and fight for what you want. You are your only obstacle. You're right. Ha-ha! Excelsior! Get you another water? No thanks. Can I ask what you're doing in a bar in your condition? Um, I'm running away. Running away? With my boyfriend. Why? My parents, they hate him. Well, I would, too. Can I ask how old you are? Um, I'm 16. 16? You're just a kid. Now you sound just like my parents. I'm sorry. Well, how old's your boyfriend? Let me guess. He's 17. He's, he's 22. 22? Man. Well, what does he do? He works construction. Part-time. Listen, it's none of my business, but you should really think twice before running away with a 22-year-old part-time construction worker. I mean, I was 22 once, and I know I wasn't ready for a wife and kid. Shit. I'm still not ready. Well, where is he, anyway? I mean, you've been sitting here for like two hours. He isn't answering his phone. Look, I'll get you some more water. You hungry? Maybe some crackers. All right. But think about what I said. So I met this blonde. Her name was Bambi or Bunny or something. She worked at a strip club. She was so hot. I paid for a lap dance. Two songs in and I got my hands where they don't belong. Well, one thing leads to another, and we're both drunk, so we head back to her place. She pounces on me as soon as we get inside. So we're making out and our clothes hit the floor. We're butt-ass naked, and she's grinding on me. I think she was a squirter. I don't remember. You know what I'm talking about, right? Anyway. I got whiskey dick, and I couldn't even- Son of a... What's up, Army? I need you to bring my dog back I told you I'm on it. Come on. Fuck, man, I'm missing my dog. Chillax, big man, you're gonna blow a gasket. Later. Sheesh. Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah. Buffy. Where the fuck is Murray? He did a good job. Yeah, definitely, definitely. It's awesome. Congratulations. It's back to reality for you. Yeah. - Can't believe it's real. - He did a good job. Uh, we haven't discussed it yet. We'll see. Oh, hey, baby. Hey, can I fill my water bottle? Sure. You want Hazed or White Rascal? No, no. I'm hoping to get at least 50 fun miles today. Yeah, this sounds real fun. Nice place, by the way. Do you serve vegan? No, we don't serve vegan, paleo, organic, gluten free, or any of that other shit you guys eat. We serve beer, wings, and burgers. Don't ask me to hold the fucking bike. - I didn't mean to- - Listen. Can I ask you a question? Why the hell do you guys wear those stupid fucking getups anyway. I mean, why don't you just wear a T-shirt and shorts, like normal fucking people? Frankly, you don't have the build for it And another thing, stay the fuck off the road. I almost pick one of you off every other day. The roads are made for cars, for Christ's sake. And you bring your bike into my fucking bar? It's probably worth more than your Subaru, am I right? Yeah, how much money can you spend on two wheels in a handlebar? You wanna get in shape? Buy a fucking weight set. Just stay off the goddamn road. See you soon. So are we a go for Operation Reservoir Dogs? - Yeah. - Reservoir Dogs? You'll see. Time to show Jen just how awesome I am. I thought your intent was to expose Rich as a fraud. Well, yeah, but- - Yeah, but we couldn't come up with a good plan. Well, I had an idea, but I'm hesitant to suggest it. What is it? You say this guy has an overactive libido, right? He doesn't wear swimsuits, Walter. Yes. Well, hear me out. I ain't going to your car. I just got here. I'll catch up with you guys. Hey, Army. Is that your Jersey up there? Yeah. So you used to play in the pros? Yeah. Wow. That's hot. Oh boy. A redhead. Yeah, it's not good, bud. I have to pee. I'll be in the ladies' room if you need me. And by the way, I'm not wearing any panties. Uh. Ah. Hey. Uh, listen. I, um, I can't do that. You're a really beautiful girl, and normally I would jump at the chance, but you're drunk and you'd regret it. So how about you go take care of busines and I'll call you a ride, on me? Hey, bud. Um, are you okay? Yeah. Really? Because you just turned down an absolute smoke show. She's drunk, man. Exactly. I'm impressed, Army. Armstrong. - What? - Where is my stuff? Listen, you're really bad. I mean, you suck. Nobody wants to listen to your shit. Fuck you, Armstrong. Hey! Everybody, quiet down. Who wants to hear some more of this guy's shitty music? Boo! You suck. You heard 'em, Ringo. Why don't you, uh, call it a night? Mr. Jones is gonna hear about this. Whatever, Dick. Hey that's okay. We're gonna do this the old-fashioned wa Just me and my guitar. Get off the stage! Oh, hey, how are the wings? - Great. - They're great. I told you so. Hey, listen, what size sneakers you wear I think my sister might have some old skates you can use. I, - I don't know. - Oh, hold on. I'll be back. Reservoir Dogs is a go. I'm not a part of this. Open the cash register! Put it in here Get back! Okay. Calm down. Just do it! What are you looking at, numb nuts? He pissed himself! Hurry the fuck up! Dude, what the fuck? Silent! No, wait, wait! Leave him. Guys. No, wait. Just let him go. Let him go! What the fuck, Army? I think you got him. Good. Hey, guys. Thanks for your help back there. No problem. Listen, sorry for being a dick earlier It's just, uh, my uncle, he got hurt in Iraq. Sorry to hear that.

I have never seen him like that before. What's going on. You seem quite subdued, Michael It's my friend. She's sick. Really sick. Life is fleeting. She's just a kid. The illness of someone close reminds us that we are still alive and healthy, perhaps for some greater purpose. It's just not fair.
