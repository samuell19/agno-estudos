We ain't even got to the party yet. Two hours later, we're bleeding pissed already. So, who cares? Better pissed and late than earlier, fucking bore. Yeah, too damn right. - So what's wrong with a bit of fun anyway? Really, drinking's a respectable enough profession, wouldn't you say? Yeah, I suppose so. Even my mum's a lush. We're all like that, me and my friends. Yeah, so Mick tells me. Can't wait to meet your friends. Oh yeah. And especially Monica. Oh, Why'S that? Just a few things I've heard. Like what? Anyway, Monica. Wait, don't go in there. Don't go into that house. An evil child was born in there, and now he's come back from far away to avenge his birthplace. Now none of us is safe. Piss off, you drunken old sod. I tell you the truth! His presence is everywhere. You have been warned. You have been warned. God, that was weird. ' Too right! Hey, it's creepy down here. No, it's not. It is. Don't be stupid, come on. Don't be so stupid. What was that? What? Over there. Nothing. No, no, what was it? I heard something, who's over there? - What are you doing, there's nothing there! Oh, come on. No, no, no. Perhaps it is the evil child. - Oh, no, it's probably a cat or something. Oh, leave it alone. - Good! I hate cats. Please, come on. Oh, come on, I just- You son of a bitch, you bastard! Your face! - You stupid berk, I might have had a gun or something. What if you did? - I would've blown your bloody head off. - Oh well, we all gotta go sometime. Too right, son. You are gonna go sometime. - How about a joint or roggie rolls. Piss off. - What about a beer, I got a crate full in the car. I was only joking. Get rid of this cleaver. They just don't understand my sophisticated sense of humor. I mean, I was just playing. Now what I need is a beer. And what we need here is a bit of excitement. Here we are, this is it. Hey, party, party, party! - You still working in that shithole? Yeah, it's bad, but you know, I'm hanging in there somehow or another. - Turning into one of Thatcher's little mechanicals, you are. Thank you. So what's going on? Things. Like what? - Well, last night I had an orgasm. Congratulations! - And this afternoon, I had two more! He's such a sweetheart. - I'm so happy for you, Ann. - So, Ann, quite the little tart. Piece of cake. - That's why we're so late, is it? That's right. What was that? Pete, is that you? - Do you ever get that strange craving after sex? - You mean like wanting to do it again? No, I mean, after sex, I always feel so much closer to God, like he's sitting next to me. Do you know what I mean? Hello, what do you want? Cheeky devil, you, eh? Come on, that's it. Open the door. - Fucking hell, look at that. Oh, horrible. What's that? It's scary down here, it is. It's horrible in here. Oh, it's dark, horrible. Who's that? It's your dad, isn't it? Shut up. Bambi. - He's one of them born-again Buddhists, look. Oh, yeah. Oh look. Oh, oh, oh, hang on a minute. What? I've gotta go for a pee. - You're joking. - No, sorry. Oh come on, Ann. Sorry, I've gotta go. What's that? Who's there? Albert? If that's you, Albert, I'll fucking murder you, mate, you loony. Come out, you bastard. Jesus! Fucking hell. Pete? Pete? Where are you? Pete? Are you in there? Don't piss about. Pete? Pete? Pete, you in there? Stop pissing about, will you? Pete? ♪ You know what you need on this record ♪ What, what, what ♪ Me, me, me, me, me - Would you mind telling me where Albert's got to? You're asking me? He's your date, sweetheart. He's your friend. - He's just gone for a walk, I bet. He had a bit of a buzz, I think. Just relax, he'll be back. Come on, let's go, this is a drag. Not me bum, baby. There's nothing wrong with David, I'll have you know. Well you said you weren't having it. Monica. You're not okay. Come on. How long have I been waiting here, all day, or what? His car's still there. He's such a jerk. I knew it, I should've have gone out with him in the first place. - He's probably just passed out on a lawn somewhere. Figures. And your date hasn't shown up, either. You can be sure I'll give that Jack Shelton a few choice words. It's okay. It was sweet enough, you setting it up in the first place. I don't care. - I'm gonna go and find the others. Monica! Albert's not back yet, we're gonna catch a cab! Monica, are you up there? Hey, you two! Monica? Hello? I guess everyone's run off on us, huh? You're not going to kill me, are you? Look, I understand. Everybody has a bad day now and then. Everyone's entitled to it. But killing people isn't gonna solve anything. Please don't kill me. I'll do anything you want. I'll make love to you. Would you like that? I'll give you a blowjob. ♪ On the left Patti? ♪ On the right Patti? Damn. You came after all! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude or anything. It's just that it's late. I didn't expect you to show up. My name is Shelly. Don't be shy, come on now. I'm so glad you've come. I'm terribly lonely, you know. I'm always the one without a date. Well Patti's run out and had a night, but usually it's me who... Perhaps we can be friends? I'd like that, wouldn't you? Pardon me? Can you not speak? Perhaps you're afflicted, too. It is strange, I cannot see, and you cannot speak. Perhaps that's why Patti planned this date for us. We'll be great friends. I just know it. We'll have wonderful times together. It seems as if everyone's up and left us. We could share a taxi. We could go to my place for a cup of tea and a little chat. I have some lovely music we can listen to. I'm afraid I'm not much of a housekeeper. I hope you won't mind. I try to keep things neat. My parents live nearby. They've got lots of money, you know. They hardly bother with me at all. They haven't time. I suppose the one bonus for blind people is a cheap electricity bill. At least for most blind people, anyway. I usually end up turning the lights on out of habit, and then forget to turn them off again. Would you like to take a seat? Would you like to dance? I used to dance all the time. I just want to live a normal life. I like it here, I can do things for myself. Sometimes I feel as if I'm missing out on so much. Sometimes you must have the same feelings. Everyday things like TV and movies. Of course I still go, at least I can listen. There's limitations, but at least my life isn't boring. Sometimes just walking across a room can be an adventure. You have to be optimistic. I want to set things straight right off. And don't think I'm weird or anything. It's just that sometimes I play up this nice girl image. People like to see the cute little blind girl acting a certain way. Maybe sometimes I play up the sympathy for all it's worth. But I hate it. I don't want to have to pretend. Not with you, anyway. I only lost my sight when I was 20. They tell me one day there might be a chance, but- I, I can speak. You can speak? - I've never had anyone to talk to much. They never gave me a chance. Who? - They always thought I was stupid. - It doesn't matter, I think you're wonderful. I think it's wonderful that you can speak. You're very lucky. I want to know everything about you. - I hate wearing this thing, this mask. But people expect it, you see. They think I'm a monster. A monster? That was really nice. Mm-hm. I don't have many male guests. How about you? Certainly not! - I'm glad, it's not safe being bisexual these days. Do you have any hobbies? None that you'd approve of. - Some of my best friends are into whips and things, and tying people up. I meet a lot of different people all the time. What kind of people? Real weirdos, it seems. They come straight for me. But so what? Who's to say what's weird? And at least they're interesting. Anyway, it's a waste of time sitting around worrying about it. - There are some things I must tell you about myself. It's very difficult. Don't be scared. I want you to feel like you can tell me anything. I'll understand. - Perhaps you should've known before. - It won't change anything. I started to explain earlier. They think I'm a monster. We're all a bit of a monster. First thing in the morning, I'm a terrible bitch. - You see, I had a horrible childhood. My father was a drunk. He was an evil man. My mother and I were forced to flee to America when I was very young. He hated us both. - No, that doesn't sound very pleasant at all. He beat me as a child. Mother as well. It was awful. I can never feel guilty for the things I've done. Do you understand? It wasn't my fault. What about Hitler? He was a battered child, wasn't he? Look what he went on to do. - You have to forget, it doesn't matter. I wouldn't care, even if you were a mass murderer. What do you mean by that? What do you mean by mass murderer? Did I say mass murderer? You mentioned Hitler. I didn't mean anything by it at all. I'm sorry, it must've been very difficult for you. It was terrible. Mother told me everything, things I couldn't possibly forget. Then one summer, we had moved to America. There was an accident at a camp we were staying at. It was supposed that I had drowned. I hadn't. No one knew it, but I lived. You cannot see my face in all its hideousness. If you could, you wouldn't stay. You'd run out on me. No one would stay! But that's not true. I like you a lot, Jackson. You seem like a nice guy. You're considerate and sincere, and you washed up all the dishes after our tea. There's not too many men like that around. You really mean that? I do, of course I do. - After Mother was gone, I lived in the wilds, a savage almost. I learned to survive on my own. What choices were there? I lived with the animals, I taught myself everything. Some of the less fortunate camp councilors would leave books behind. I read them all over and over again. My life is in its last hour, that I know. Nor would I redeem a moment of that hour. What I have done is done. I bear within a torture that could gain nothing from life. Thou didst not tempt me, and thou couldst not tempt me. I have not been thy dupe, nor am I prey, but was my own destroyer, and will be my own hereafter. Back, ye baffled fiends! The hand of death is on me, but not yours. 'Tis over, my dull eyes can fix thee not. But all things swim around me, and the earth heaves as were beneath me. Fare thee well. Give me thy hand. 'Tis not so difficult to die. That was wonderful. It was beautiful! I've heard great things about Byron. - Yes, yes, passionate, yet moody, remorseful, yet unrepentant. All of my favorite adjectives. Manfred's tortured memory, that enormous guilt which drives a hero to his inevitable doom. One must admire that. Although, I find it quite a shame, the limitations he established for himself. - I'm not sure what you mean exactly. - Well, being formally innovative was not a big concern of Byron's. His reputation suffers for it today, I think. His models were largely neoclassic, and perhaps a bit worn. His lyrics a little old-fashioned, even in his own clay. - It is unfortunate, considering his genius. You know, it's not often I meet a man with such an appreciation for literature. - It's not often that I meet a woman. - Perhaps we can go for a walk in the park tomorrow. You could recite more Byron to me. - It's such a beautiful, misty morning. It must be lovely. I'm sorry. Please don't be. Don't ever be sorry for me. It's hard enough not being sorry for myself. - You don't seem like such a bitch in the morning. - You don't seem like such a monster. I have my better days. - Perhaps we could go for that walk in the park now? What's wrong, Jackson? Is something bothering you? I can't go there. Not to the park. They'll laugh! Father. - Oh, so you've come back at last. - I would've come sooner, but something strange is happening to me. - How long have you been going around like that, with your face hanging out about all over the place, like a goddamn leper? Just a day. I've left my mask somewhere, I don't know where. You've got no brains, boy. There's nothing in that head of yours up there. Well, I guess we'll just have to get you another one. I haven't any money. - Oh well, no, I don't expect you to. But you could have lots of money. You could just take their wallets. I won't steal from them. Isn't it bad enough slashing their throats? But you gotta live. And you've gotta kill. Father, you must understand. I don't want to kill anymore. I'm going to quit. Quit? Are you crazy? You're a psychopathic killer. Your family's been mad for generations. Put this on. You're as ugly as sin and it's making me sick. You never get anything right, do you? L try- I don't know what's wrong with me. - You're completely and absolutely fucking abnormal, that's what's wrong with you. I've found someone. What? I've met someone. You met someone? Oh, isn't that lovely? Her name is Shelly. - Shelly, she a poet or something? I think I'm in love with her. It's her I'm going to change for. It's time I made something of myself. Made something of yourself? I can't bear it much longer. It's my only chance. - Well, my dear God in Heaven, this is a tale. It is what I should've expected. Is she of our persuasion? No. Thought I should've asked. I've searched. Well, you search in vain. It doesn't happen to women, it seems. Even if you were in love, it could never work. - I don't want to lose her. No, I don't suppose you do. I guess I'm gonna have to tell you my story. Both my parents were destroyed when I was a child. Yes, I was a real killer. Merciless, until I started denying it, doubting myself. I watched my little son grow up. It didn't take long to see what you were. But all that time you spent in the swamp- It was a lake. - I thought it was the best thing that could happen to you. I thought it might save you from ever having to know the weak human half your mother gave you. And from all those stories, the killing you were doing. I must say I was really kind of proud. And then this fiasco, the mess you left upstairs, all that blood and guts splattered all over the place. And the bodies, you think I like living here with this rotten, stinking smell all over the place? And what of me? - What do you think, boy? Both sides tearing away, pushing one way, then the next. Half human, half killer. I'd hate to be inside that head of yours. I'm a freak. - A freak, learn to live with it. I can't. I won't. - You saw what it did to your mother. Would you put that woman through this hell? Would you create another offspring like yourself? No, you've got your answers. Leave me now, go out into the night. Try to be true to yourself. - But I can't live like that, not anymore. There must be some way. You said there was a way. - For me, there could have been peace if, when I'd realized my mistake, I'd destroyed you. Both of you, but I just couldn't do it. My moment of weakness. And look where it's left me. I was once a great killer. I took pride in myself, in the excellence of my existence. You think I like this torment, the guilt I've been left with? You think I like being the dirty fucking alcoholic I've become? Living in this pigsty of a, no, leave me alone! Never show your horrible face in my presence again. - See, it's not as bad as all that. My girlfriends bring me down here all the time. They help me buy my clothes. I have to trust their opinions a lot. I don't like that part so much, but it's awfully good of them, and it's so much fun. - I'm afraid I don't get out much myself. Or during the day, at least. So what do you do for fun? What? Come on, you can tell me. When I was younger, I used to go to the movies a lot. Not much anymore. I have friends in the business, I guess you would say. Really? They make films? That's exciting. - Movies are made about them. - Oh, I have friends who are actors. My best friend Christi is going out with a guy who's going to be famous one day. Or at least he says he is. LS this it? Madeleine Kay's. The one with the beautiful woman that can't run away. - My girlfriend Patti says there's a beautiful dress in the window. She said it would look adorable on me. It is beautiful. Could you describe it to me? - It's off the shoulder with a ruffled bow on each side, a silver-embroidered top, all in turquoise. Oh, it sounds lovely. It's strange sometimes. When you can't see the colors, you start to forget which outfit is which. Do you like clothes, Jackson? - I like anything black, but I don't bother much. What's wrong? Let's go back. It's all right. They're laughing. - They don't know anything, they're just stupid. - I don't care, I hate it. I could slit their little throats, that would stop their sniggering. Let's cross the street. Please, I have an idea. - Shelly, my bloody feet are killing me. Is it Oscar's Den you want? Yes, that's the place. - Why do you wanna go in here? It's all Halloween masks. I know. Come on, trust me. Let's go in. Hello. - Hello, I wonder if you can help me. - I'll take a look around. Here we are, Madame. Thank you. Jackson? Shelly? - A friend of mine wore one last Halloween. Everyone seemed to think it was a real hit. How do I look? Fine. That's it, just fine? - You're making a joke of this. You think I enjoy wearing this mask? - I thought it might help you to feel more comfortable. I don't have to buy it. I didn't mean that. This Halloween thing. How would you like it if once a year, everyone dressed up like a blind person and went around acting like idiots? - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. But why does it have to be a goalie mask you wear? You must look just like that stupid man in the film, The Hand of Death. Don't you see? Don't you understand what's going on here? I am that guy from the movies! - Will you ever quit with these crazy stories, Jackson? Have we decided yet? I'm afraid you really are gonna have to make up your mind. Normally we don't even allow people to try them on. Health reasons, you understand. Hardly hygienic, is it, having people breathe all over the merchandise? Hello? Hi, I let myself in. Christi? - Shelly, where have you been hiding? You don't keep in touch anymore. There you are. I just dropped by to tell you that we're having a little party at the cottage on Saturday night. Why don't you come along? You could bring your new man with you. Yeah, that would be fun. I'll ask him. So we'll see you Saturday? Yeah. - And you're going to stop being such a stranger. We should get out more, like the old days. Yeah. - You sure you don't wanna come up for a drink? - No, thanks. - Okay. See you soon. Bye. See you Saturday. Bye! Hi. Hi, Barry. Oh, hi. I was just finishing this story. At the end, she turns around. She says, "Oh, Barry, you're so cool." Oh, come off it, Barry, you're about as street as Brian Tilsley. Fuck me! This is amazing. Don't tell me, you're that guy in that movie, aren't you? This is amazing, meeting you in here. - Come on, mate, sit down, have a drink with us, eh? Nick, listen. Look, we are in the presence of a real live celebrity here. We saw the cameras and lights and shit up the street. Barry here's an actor. We're both actors, actually. - Gonna make it big one day, all the way. - I must have a pen here somewhere. - You must make lots of money in films, especially off those bloody yanks, eh? - Hey, look, you don't ask someone what they earn. It's none of your business, all right? - Oh, here it is, I knew it was somewhere. Your autograph, please, if you don't mind. - Jesus, where's he supposed to sign, your forehead? Beer mat. Hey, let's have a toast, eh? To America. Oh, fuck America! To Chelsea, the best footie team in the land. Do you like football, mate? - Not much of a gabber, are you, mate? To fucking America! Yeah! To Ronnie Reagan! To Mark Chapman! To George Wallace! To Mick Jagger! To Terry Vega! Now there is a real life American dream. Well drink up, mate. Got some kind of problem? Something bothering you? Lay off him, Nick. I want my autograph. What sort of a bloody snob are you? It's just an autograph, it's not gonna hurt you. What does it say? I can't read it. I slit your throat. I slit your throat. - What sort of an autograph is that? Oh, brilliant, man, you know? You've broken her heart. Real comedian, aren't you? Why don't you get rid of that mask, mate? Come on, let's see what you're hiding under here. You fucking wanker! So what are you waiting for? Get the bastard! There, come on! - What'd I tell you about those Americans? They're fucking mad. He's in there, all right. - Bastard, I'd like to rip his fucking face off. - Yeah, tear him to fucking pieces, eh, Christi? - All right, you go through there, and I'll go around the back and cut him off. Hang on a minute. Why don't you go through there, and I'll go around the other side and cut him off? What's the difference? Exactly. He was rather big, wasn't he? Mean looking bastard as well. - Did you see East Enders last night? I don't think much of your new friends. - Well, here he is, my son, the freak. Why did you come back, boy? I live here. That was a lot of years ago. - But there's still a part of me here. A part of me that must now come to an end. Well, isn't that poetic? Having a holiday? More of an exit, really. I've been here long enough, too long. It's time to look for something new. Bones may be a bit creaky, but it's still sharp up here. I've got a few good years left, I'd say. - I'd have to disagree. I think it's already too late for you. - That doesn't make much sense to me, but then, I guess there's no understanding you, kid. - You've led a rather nasty old life, haven't you? Oh, hang on a second here! A man does his best. We've all made mistakes. - But some mistakes are beyond forgiving. Don't tear at my heartstrings. I won't bear an ounce of guilt for you. My mistakes are all behind me now, and that's where they'll stay. You old fool. Your biggest mistake stands right before you, before your very eyes. You had your chance, on your own admission, but you hadn't the guts to deal with it. Don't talk to me about guts! It's out of my hands now, your own life is yours for the taking. - You know that's a lie. I understand all of this now. I'm being condemned. This murderous life of mine will go on year after year, and there's nothing I can do to stop it. I'm not afraid to face my fate. I'm not afraid to be alone. Well, what a noble fellow. What a hero you'll become. It's a lot of nonsense, boy. - I have no more shame. I'm not afraid of you any longer. - Oh, what a monumental time it's been for you. It has. And I'm sorry for you. - It's funny, you know, I was gone, I'd made my exit. I only came back for this stupid picture. Can you imagine that? She was so beautiful. She was everything to me. If only- If only. Jackson? I wish you wouldn't do that. - I'm sorry, I hope I didn't scare you. I brought you some chocolates. Really? - I'm so stupid, I almost bought flowers for you again. - Oh no, don't be silly, I love flowers. I don't get them very often. Anyway, chocolates are much nicer. - These are the ones with little cherries in brandy. Oh, lovely. I hope dinner is okay. Suppose I'm a bit late. I had a few things to take care of. Is everything all right? - I can do with a couple of asprin. My head is really throbbing. Are you managing all right? Just fine. - I could help if you showed me what to do. - No, no, I prefer to do it myself. It's not so difficult. Actually, I'm quite a good cook. Mm, smells wonderful. - I'm not so good with a corkscrew, though. Would you mind opening the wine? Right. - Oh yes, before I forget, some friends of mine are having a party this Saturday at their cottage. Christi and her boyfriend Nick, the actor friends I was telling you about. I was telling Christi about you. She invited us both. What did you say about me? - Nothing much, just that I'd met a man who I was seeing quite a lot of lately. I know you don't like to go out much in public, but these people are really nice. Damn. Are you all right? I've cut myself. Oh. Are you sure you still want to go through with this tonight? I mean, there's no rush. Yes, fine, no problem. I hope the dinner's okay. I tried to time everything. If it's burnt, you can't do a thing with it. I hope it's cooked enough. If it isn't, you can always put it back in the oven. Is it all right? It's very good. You know, Shelly, before I met you, I was terribly lonely. I had no one. Everything's different now. I don't know what it is, but I feel certain that one day, life's going to be just perfect for us. If only I could be rid of that stupid mask. - It's funny, since I've been blind, I've always had to wear these sunglasses. Anyway, I'm sure no one cared, really. They probably thought us a cute couple when we were in the market last week. They probably thought it was some crazy new fashion. Maybe we'll start a whole new trend. - Maybe I'm just not up to it after all. Maybe I'm impotent, did you ever consider that? - That's silly, you're just a little tense. You really think so? - You were fine all the other times when we made love, wonderful. Honestly? It's not so different. Trust me. - If so many things didn't keep going wrong. But a lot has gone right. - I suppose it won't do any good to sulk about it. Tonight I just want to do everything I can to please you. - You're so wonderful, Jackson, like a dream. All right. So where do we begin? - I keep a few things in the drawer by the bed. God! You could kill someone with this thing. I don't know, I think it just makes me feel more inadequate. There's a whole drawer full of the stuff! - I have to occupy my spare time somehow. - Yes, but couldn't you take up knitting or painting or something? Don't worry. Everything's going to be all right, you'll see. That's easy for you to say. It's not easy for me to say. It's not been easy for me at all. I'll never forget when I first started having sex. Pretty clumsy, but I survived. I had a boyfriend for a while then, but he wasn't much help. I always ended up feeling terribly guilty, until I realized it was him who didn't know the first thing about making love. - I suppose the first time you do it is always a bit of a letdown. The first time for me was with one of those camp councilors. She was dead. - I suppose we're all a dead lay now and again. Sometimes you're just not up to it. I keep a few more things in the closet over there. Right. Who's this? You mean Juliet? Juliet? What's she doing here? - I sleep with her sometimes, when I get really lonely. But she's a she! You sleep with a female blowup doll? That's not exactly normal, is it? It is only plastic, after all. - But Shelly, it has all the right parts. Did you like that? Perhaps you're scared of me. Would you like to be Mama's slave? Well, answer me, little boy. This is crazy. What do I say, what am I meant to say? It's not so crazy. Try to concentrate. Tell me to be nice, that you'll be a good boy. I can't, it's just not me. - I thought you wanted to share each other's lives, to know everything. I know, but... - All right, let me play the submissive one. Okay, now be mean to me. Punish me, be tough. Shelly. - Okay, use the manual if you have to. Try page 42, that's a good one. Please don't hurt me. I don't like to be whipped. I don't mean to be a bad girl. I'll do anything you like me to. I'll cook for you, I'll clean for you. Anything. Tell me what you like. Tell me what you need. You wicked whore. You don't want me to hurt you, but you must be punished. You've been a very naughty girl. You will bring me my slippers, and then I will paddle the fleshy round cheeks of your bottom, until they become red with lust. - Oh no, please don't, I promise to be good. - You will be good, my saucy wench, and I must punish you. I feel ridiculous doing this. I'm sorry. We don't have to do anything. Come here. - You all right there, mate? Come on, mate! Come on, get his bloody leg. - Will you? - Get in. Shut up. - Hey guys, I'm not completely helpless. - Only helpless enough to be confined to bed. Oh, come on. - Doctor's orders, you're going to stick to that. - Come on, then, let's get you upstairs, eh? Hey look, I'm okay, guys. Yeah, yeah. Be careful with him. - Christ, it was only an eight inch blade, for God's sake. - So don't think tomorrow's party is off for this little scrape. - I'm afraid it's too late. I've called everyone and canceled. - Jesus, you make such a big deal about a little puncture. I'm hardly even hurt. - So we'll hang around and keep you company, right? - Yeah, sure, Charlotte's coming out. We'll just have a nice quiet weekend. You'll be up and around within a week. - Okay, so bring me a beer, will you? One beer, and that's it. Hang on, I'll get it. Come on, Barry. Nick, cut it out! - So what now, I suppose we can't have a little fun, either? You heard the doctor. Oh, fuck the doctor. You'll survive for one night. I'll go and get you that beer. I'll get it in here! Hello, hello, hello, Nicko's party palace here. Hello?

What? - No, not to any party, not to any cottage. - Why? - Listen to me. Everything's fine, I have to warn you, Shelly. What are you talking about? - Please don't go out there. Jackson? Jackson? - Nice place you've got here, Nick. I've heard about some of your little parties. - Yeah, well, we all have our fun. - Course, I've only heard about them. - Okay, no quarreling, not today, at least. It's bad luck. It's bad luck? Don't you know what day it is? It's Friday. Friday the 13th. Bring on the scaly monster! - How about bringing on another burger? Yeah, coming right up. - Come on, Charlotte, let's go for a swim, eh? Now's the best time, all the swamp creatures are out. Come on. No way I am gonna go for a swim. - Oh, but you promised! - No, I'm too drunk. I'm feeling really drunk. - You're not drunk at all. No, no, look, look. - No, no, no, I need to- No, I am drunk, I'm drunk, no, please. - I tell you what, if I do the dive, you follow me, okay? I might. You're gonna follow me, okay? No, sure. - Okay, if you go in, I promise you I'll come in, okay? Yeah, you will. - I dare you to dive in, I bet you won't. - You dare me? - You're a coward! - You really dare me? - You're a coward! - Oh, come on. - You're a coward. Steady, boy, steady. Come on. - You'll never guess what, Mac, I could've sworn there was something behind those sheets. - What's the news on the audition? What audition is that, Barry? - Ah, well, I think that's the audition I wasn't supposed to mention. Nice one, Barry. - It doesn't matter, Nick, you can't make it anyway. Barry- Well, it's tomorrow, actually. Listen, it's just another adaptation of one of those stupid Shakespearean dramas that Melvin Whitemore's always putting on. - I made arrangements for you to go next week. And you auditioned? Yeah. For Shakespeare? Oh, Barry. Can't believe you even considered that wanker. Look, since nursery school, we've had that rot shoved down our throats. Hamlet is a wimp. Lear, the senile old goat. And Romeo and Juliet, makes me puke. Do you think next week will be too late for me to audition? - Maybe not, I think he's considering you for the lead. For the lead? A gritty street punk Macbeth. The whole thing's set in the present, gang war style. Street punk Macbeth. Christ, do you know how many times I've played Macbeth? Stars, hide your fires, let not light see my black and deep desires. The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be which the eye fears, when it be done, to see. Really cathartic, man. It's great out here! - No, it's not, it's cold and creepy, and I wanna go back to the party. - Oh, but they're so boring back there. - Come here and keep me warm. - I'll tell you what, I'll build you a nice fire. - A fire? - Yeah, right here. I'm just gonna get some wood, okay? Don't be long. Mac! - Go ahead, scream if you like. To be perfectly honest, I'm really starting to get bored with the whole thing. - You're the guy from the pub, aren't you? The one that attacked Nick. Ridiculous, isn't it? I mean, fine, so I have to kill. I have no choice in the matter. But you'd think they'd let me try something else, as well. I do have other talents. No sense bothering to run for it, really. You'll get 10 feet, maybe, and run into a branch, or stumble over a root. See, what did I tell you? Your fate is sealed as tightly as mine. Except for me, it's so much worse. - The least you could do is complement me some of the time. - But I thought you were gonna go to Los Angeles and become famous, and make lots of money. Oh, and forget about all that classical bullshit. - This classical bullshit, darling, that is my destiny. But first, I must give them Macbeth one last time. - Nick, you're supposed to be in bed! He'll rupture those stitches. - If there was something we could do. No, nothing. He doesn't care about anything. - I could go fetch him if you want. - No, it's all right, I'll go and find him. I'm getting used to his crap. - Get thee to thy mistress when thy drink is ready. She strikes upon the bell. Get thee to thy bed! Brilliant. Thy mistress strikes upon the bell. Go, get thee to bed! Is this a dagger I see before me? A handle toward my hand. Come, let me clutch thee. God! - I see thee still, yet I have thee not. Art though fatal vision sensible to sight as well as to feeling? Or art though but a dagger of the mind? A false creation... That was terrible. - Do you think we should've left Christi by herself? She seems so upset. No, she said she didn't mind. She'll just sit around for a bit, then go find Nick, and everything will be fine. - Stay there a moment, I want to wash and brush my teeth. - I don't think I can bear waiting. Here I am, darling, come and get me. Here I come, Barry! Hello, darling. Hey Barry, wake up, silly. You're not going to crash out on me, are you? Barry! Charlotte! Stupid fucking bitch. Charlotte! Charlotte. I'm sorry I left you on your own in the woods. Oh, just come out now. - Nick, I'm sorry, you know I didn't mean it. Nick. Nick? Nick, come on, quit being stupid. Nick. Meagan, help me! Help me! Shit! - If only there were something more. It just all seems so pointless. The real monsters are out there, I hope you understand. If only there were something more. It just all seems so pointless. Hello? Do you think they'll be able to fix it? Okay, I'll keep trying, thank you. Who is it? Who is it? Jackson. I was so worried about you. I didn't know what was going on, you never said anything. I've been just sitting here, waiting. I'm sorry. It's just not a good night to be going out. - It's just that I feel like there's something going on, I don't know what. Is everything all right with you? Yes. - Maybe you've found somebody else. You've met another woman, haven't you? You must be joking. - It's just that everything seems to be slipping away. - Shelly, can I ask you something? Of course. - Would you like to live forever? What? That's a strange question. Could you answer it? Well, I don't know. Why not? Yes, of course I'd like to live forever. - And are you happy, honestly? Yeah, I am. A lot of the time, Fifty-fifty, I suppose. Times eternity. That's an awful lot of suffering. And for the most of the people, Fifty-fifty will be a blessing. After tonight, you'll just be a memory. What do you mean? - They'll let you die, or at least be forgotten. What of me? Designed to kill, trapped in all of this, forever. All Of what? - If only there was something I could do for you, Shelly. I really do love you. - What do you mean, Jackson, I don't understand. - After tonight, we can never see each other again. Don't say that, Jackson. How can you say such a thing? - I can't go on deceiving you, Shelly. You know nothing of me. Yes I do, I know you so well, and I want to know everything about you. It will be too painful. I could never be so evil as to share my hell with you. - This is insane, Jackson, I don't know what you're saying. Jackson, I'm pregnant. I'm going to have a baby, our baby. No. That can't be. No, I couldn't let that happen. I couldn't put an innocent child through this. - It wouldn't be as bad as all that. It would finally mean a normal, happy life for us both. I thought you would be happy. I am happy. I love you, Shelly. But it could never work. For me, it's impossible. You must trust me, Shelly. Do you trust me? I do, Jackson, I love you. Then please, please forgive me. It's a hell of a life, being a monster. It's a hell of a life. No! No!
