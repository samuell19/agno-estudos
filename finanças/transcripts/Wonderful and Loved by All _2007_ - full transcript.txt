Good news! Ingmar is feeling better. He'll be here on Monday. We'll have a look at Act II, it starts with Viola's wallflip. - Now? - Yes. No, I'd like to have a look at Act I first- - just to make sure everything is in order. Wait for me... - How are things with you? - Great. - And you? - Good. - Can I see you tonight? - I've got things I must do first. Everyone has so much to do... I have to do the house cleaning, bring peace to the Middle East- - reduce the greenhouse effect- - and coach the Danish team for the World Cup... ...but if I'm done before 10 p.m. I'll call you. Isabelle, you are making progress. That's why I've decided we should move on. Your acrobatic skills will be below par, but that's your responsibility. I accept total responsibility. What are we going to do today? We are going to do a long caboulous. Have you any idea how much time I've got? I should have learnt this ages ago, all we do is caboulous! Fuck this! You're going to teach me how to do a wallflip! I'm sorry, I don't know what got into me. We can talk about it, if you want more money... - So you think this is about money? - No, but I can pay double the rate. You know what? Acrobatics is an ancient art, over 1000 years old. It's not something you can buy like a whore on the street. You can teach me for free, if it makes you feel better... Voltaire... The courses we have here are for children mostly. I need an intensive course, could I have private lessons? There is a guy, but I'm not sure if he still lives in Sweden. This is really urgent, it's a question of life or death. Get out of here! This is for children only. That's enough! You have to leave. You there! I've already told you to take it easy. I'm sorry. - Hi! - Sorry I'm late, I'm totally wrecked. - Are you O. K? - Just about. - Would you like a glass of wine? - Yes, I would. Could I have a sandwich? I haven't eaten all day. Have you made this... Have you made this for me? There, there... Bella, Vesa wants to see you. It's important. It istotally unacceptable, it cannot go on like this. I'll deal with it right away. Absolutely, I'll call you later. - How do you like it here? - I like it. If you have any problems, I want you to know- - that you can always turn to me, any time. How are you getting along with Bostr?m? We're getting along fine. That's great, Bella! I'm glad we had this little chat. O.K. Let's go! This is not working! - What do you mean, it's great. - No. No, no! One more time... You don't need a stick, you're an actor after all. Happy Birthday! - I thought we said 7 p.m. - Never mind, I'll give you a hand. I can do that. - Have you got cable channels? - Can we do that later? Get the cake knife, it's in the second drawer. - It's a special Pata Negra knife. - Yes, we bought it with the ham. How strange, there's the shop we bought it in. - Can I see... - That's the actual shop. - Who is it? - Stay where you are. Staffan? - Hi honey! - Hi... The greenhouse effect and nasal drops and... I was in the neighborhood and I... I can come by later on... Toodle-o! - This is Micke. - I can see that. Hi, Micke! I'm Bella's mom, come in and have some cake. Micke is in a hurry. How long do you intend to stay in Sweden? - Copenhagen is a nice city. - Should I open the other presents? Now that Bella is making her national theater debut- - I wanted her to have this scrapbook. I've saved everything that has been written about her. Can I have it, Bella? Give it to me. Look, a whole page, and here's the interview... - That's enough, mom! ...in the evening paper. I missed that. I don't understand why they say you're an acrobat. You can't tie your shoelaces without panting. - Micke, we have to go now. - Totally ridiculous! - We have to go now. - You don't have to leave yet. - We're going out to eat. - Yes... That's a pity, it was so nice to meet you. - Our parking meter is running out. - Great, we can all leave together. - They're crazy. - A little over the top, maybe. Will Chinese do? - Bella, there you are! We have to... - I know. Bella, Bella! Bella... Bella... Bella... Hi, I was just looking at some costumes, this is really nice. A belated Happy Birthday! Why does it say "Sitzplats"? Is it because it's Mozart? No, it's probably because it's the Vienna Opera. What a gift! It's too much. It's the best remedy when you're stressed out. - Take a break for a few days. - I'll need to think about it first. - Isabella Ekl?f. - Hi! Water... Who hasn't lied at some point in their lives, but lying to Bergman- - and the Royal Dramatic Theater, doesn't happen every day. With us in the studio: Genuine actor, Reine Brynolfsson. - And false acrobat, Isabella Ekl?f. - Five, four, three... I'd like to welcome Reine Brynolfsson and Isabella Ekl?f- - who are rehearsing "Twelfth Night" directed by Ingmar Bergman. - What's it like working with Bergman? - It's every actor's dream. Isabella, you are both actress and acrobat. Yes. - What have you done up to this? - This and that... I have worked with very small theaters... Puppet theaters. What circushave you workedwith? CircusScott? No, I've worked abroadwith people ofvariousnationalities. Sounds great, what's the name of the circus? - Circus Reine. - What a coincidence! Yes, indeed. What's it like working with Bergman compared to other directors? You feel chosen, like a flower in a summer meadow. That was well said. I liked the way you handled that. - You mean the flower? - No, Bergman. Hi! Did you see us being interviewed? - Yes, it was great. - See you later. I came up with an idea last night, maybe Pelle's dad can help you. He's a doctor, what can he do for me? He can give you a certificate and you can quit. - They'll never know you lied. - I can't back out- - this close to the premiere. - O.K. But take it easy with Micke. Afriend of mine told me... What the hell do you... You don't know anything about him. O.K. I'm sorry. Vilgot has been crying all night- - and I might be moved to another department when I go back to work. I realize you're having a tough time, but let's not talk about Micke. Hi, I'll put it there. - Remember I warned you. I've had it. Does it bother you that I have a life- - while you sit at home all day knitting? Does that bother you? Do you mean that, Bella? I am so tired of hearing that I'm hopeless and you're not! You're always telling me that I pick the wrong guys! I'm not putting up with it any longer. Fuck off! Bella... ...a belated Happy Birthday! - Hi, this is Bella. - Hi, are you busy? - No, not at all. How did it go? - You're in luck. - That teacher I mentioned is here. - You're kidding? He's right here, you can talk to him. Hi, my name is Voltaire. Hello... Hi. What the hell do you think this is? Do you think this is some kind of fucking circus you're dealing with? This is the Royal Dramatic Theater! I'm warning you, you might think I'm angry right now- - but just you wait and see Bergman's reaction next week. You'll wish you were never born. Bella, I didn't mean to... My grandmother just died. Oh, I had no idea. - I'm sorry. - You should have told me. - When did it happen? - Last night. She died in her sleep, at least she didn't suffer. Let me know if there's anything we can do for you. Take a few days off. I'll see you after the weekend, if you feel you're up to it, Bella. - O.K. - Good. When you come back we can... I found it at last! It's just a coat. - It's yours. - Thank you, grandma. E-mail it to me here at the hotel. Hang on... You look great. I've got to go, Sofia Coppola's agent is waiting for me in the lobby. We're having dinner with her and some Austrian producer. We have screen tests all day tomorrow. Are we having dinner with Sofia Coppola? No. I had to invent a story so that I could come here with you. - You sounded very convincing. - Being an actor has its advantages. - What if someone sees us here? - That would be really something. - Good morning. - You're up early. I'm an early riser. I'm going down to the lobby to fax something. We can have breakfast when I come back. Hurry up! Micke... - Hi. - Did it go O. K? - Sorry? - Did you get the fax off? Yes. I know a nice caf? we can go to. Have you finished? See that house over there, it's the Astoria. Gustaf Mahler lived there. Beethoven. Strauss. Mozart. Let's find a place to have a drink. I feel a bit tired, I'd rather go back to the hotel. Come on! We're in Vienna. I wonder what's in there? Let's check it out. - Cheers! - Cheers! Sorry for being such an idiot today... Micke, there's something I have to tell you... I'm afraid I've gotten myself into a lot of trouble at the theater. - I'm in a state of panic. - Everybody goes through that. - No, this is really bad! - Lf it's any comfort to you... ...it can't be worse than what I'm going through. Do you know what that idiot director wants me to do? He wants me to have a haircut before the premiere. - I have to have a haircut too. - But they're not going to scalp you! The problem is, the acrobatic scenes that I... I'd prefer that to those silly dance numbers. I've told them a hundred times, Mack the Knife shouldn't... Have you got a cold? I have a premiere coming up. - I don't want to catch anything. - No, it went down the wrong way. There's no need to worry. You know what... I'd love to forget about everything and sit here with you forever. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, mom. - ThisisRolf. - Mary can'ttalk right now. - What's the matter? Grandma died last night, she died in her sleep. She wentto bed asusual and she didn'twake up again. It was a very peaceful death, at least she didn't suffer. This is awful, even though I didn't know her- - I feel really terrible. - I feel as if it's my fault. - No, of course it's not. I'll re-book our tickets and we'll travel home today. - No, there's no need to do that. - You should be with your mom. You'll have arrangements to make. - It's very nice of you, but... - No, it's no problem. Kajsa, Pella and Vilgot are out atthe moment, but ifyou leave a... Does Thursday the 1st suit you? The church is free then. - Thursday... Yes, that's fine. - After 6 p.m. Would suit me. - No, evenings are out. - But I'm rehearsing. - How about the 25th? - We'll be in Argentina. No, that won't do, we'll take the 1st. Surely you can take time off for your grandmother's funeral! - Yes, but... - I can call him. Who does he think he is, this Bergman - God almighty? Rehearsalsfor"Twelfth Night"Act 1 startin five minutes. I've rigged up the Corde lisse. I'm not sure it's perfect, check it before you start. Good luck! At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning... ...Bergman will be here. We have to be ready for him, no sloppiness. Take your places, everyone. - What country is this? - This is Illyria, lady. And what should I do in Illyria? My brother, he is in Elysium. He is a rogue and a passy measures pavin. I hate drunken rogues. Away with him! It's a pity that we didn't find the time to try this out. O. K, the red light comes on when it's time to roll down. I hope it goes well. Good luck. Shit! Bergman is here, he's waiting in the rehearsal room. I did it! Did you see that? Hello! Shit! Hello? Hi! I did it, I did a real Corde lisse! Do you understand what I'm saying? - No, not really. - I was right all along. Oh, this looks really nice! I got to meet Bergman, he is so charming even though he's so old. You can tell me about it later, I'll call you. - Do you want me to leave? - I've got lines to learn. It would be best if you left. - I don't understand... - Shut up and leave! Hi, honey! Can I take your coat? Bella is leaving. I just remembered, you work together. Bye. Please leave now. What's going on? That's a good question, she keeps following me around- - but don't worry, Bella is leaving now. - Leave now. - You are really sick! - Don't make a scene. - You've been lying to me. Hang on here just a minute... Mind what you say, you are the one who has lied - to Bergman! She claims to be a trained acrobat. What was it your mother said again? You can't tie your shoelaces without panting. Bella, Vesa wants to see you immediately. The theater doesn't intend to take legal proceedings against you. You can sign a letter of resignation and that will be the end of it. - Will you be forced to cancel? - No, I don't think so. Ingmar has had a rethink. There isn't time for the acrobatic numbers in the dream sequences. That means I can play the part of Viola after all. Maybe not. Let me see... You look great! Pelle and I sat up all night talking. - We are having a tough time. - Is something the matter? We have made our minds up. We're going to abandon our chore schedule. It's really scary- - but I think it's for the best, because we can't go on... I need to go to the ladies room. Good evening. Bella, I... You look great. How's everything? Good, very good in fact. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cause any trouble. I have the premiere at the Royal Dramatic coming up. This role may be the deciding factor for my future career. If they found out that I knew you had lied- - and kept quiet about it, it would ruin everything for me. It's great to see you. - I've missed you. - And Liselotte? - That was nothing. - So it's over between you? There was never anything between us, she... There's no need to explain. Bella, you're really special. You're not like any other girl I've met. You and me, we go well together. We can go to your place. Sure, we can do that. Bella? Just as well. What's this? Oh no! The Threepenny Opera Sold out. Premiere tonight. Hello, I'm locked in here. I need help! I have a premiere tonight, at the Royal Dramatic. Hello? Don't go, no! Bachelor Party in progress. Do not open! Come back here! Oh, how I hate this country! I hate Sweden! Hello? I'm an actor, Micke Jensen from Copenhagen. I need your help. I'm Danish! The premiere has been cancelled, one of the actors fell ill. I'll give you a ride to the studio. Kajsa Zeminov, this is a historic moment. Everything I owe you is in there. Grandma left me her car and some money too- - but it's incredibly expensive to take a driver's license. Look, I can drive, basically, I just need a few more lessons. I can't believe the way people drive around here! - Take it. - Are you sure? You are so kind. I can pick you up after work, I need to practice my driving. - How's your new job, by the way? - It's great fun. This week I'm casting a presenter for our new Saturday show. When can I start? The job would suit you, but there's just one little problem: You have to be fluent in French. Fluent French in two weeks? I can do that, no problem. How hard can it be? No problemo!
