Hey! The sheriff ain't in. Come back tomorrow. You say something? I only said the sheriff ain't in. Well, where would we be lucky enough to find him? Fishing. He'll be back tomorrow for the hanging. But I can help. Why not? You could tell us something. Sure. What? Some time ago there was a reward out for Bill San Antonio. Five thousand, I believe. I can check up. It'll only take a little while. Take my word for it. Here's all that's left of him. Enough for the reward. Our old friend died with his boots off. No, I'm sorry. We need sure proof. Unfortunately, I can't supply you with sure proof, as you call it. He got blown up. Come on, Hutch, let's not waste any more time. Hey, what shall I do with these? Play with 'em in your free time. Hyah! What can I do for you? Take three or four men and have them carry in the case that's on that wagon. And tell your friend to keep his eyes peeled. There's three hundred thousand in there. Dollars? As good as. It's gold. Same as got robbed from a train in the MK&T a month ago. And which we were lucky enough to pick up. Really, sir, I--Just one more thing. Where can we find the owner of this piggy bank? Mr. Harold's office is upstairs. But the president isn't scheduled to see anyone today, Mr., uh...? I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. And unless I know that, I... I never told you. Come on, Hutch. Hey, you two. If Mr. Pick says the president won't see ya, it means you ain't going anywhere, understand? Get a move on. Let's get that case out there unloaded now, Buttercup. There's no use in runnin' risks. My good man, I think you'd better announce us to your boss. But weren't you told that Mr. Harold receives callers only by appointment? He'll receive us, you'll see. Just say it's San Antonio who wants to talk to him. You could be our Lord in person, it'd be the same thing. Don't forget, huh? - Bill San Antonio. If he sees us, it means he and Bill were in cahoots. Because a bandit who steals a bank's gold from a train is likely to be the last person in the world to know the president of that bank. So if Bill was telling the truth, and he kept swearing he was, then half the gold he robbed in the past few years finished in the pockets of that gentleman, right? Hmm. That's why he won't see us. All we have to do is look at him to understand it's impossible a man like him could have got mixed up with that son of a bitch. Oh, may he rest in peace. Let's get out of here, Cat. We might as well wait. If I'm right... I'll make him spit up all the loose change. There's enough of that for both of us to retire on. Come in, gentlemen, please. You think we overdid it? No. A small personal gift from Mr. Harold. How should I put it? A little memento of his appreciation for what we've done for him. In gold, mister. Get it ready. We'll be by in a couple of hours. You're gonna need a little time. Gold, huh? How does it feel to be rich? I don't know, I'm not used to it yet. Hey, watch it. A quarter of a dollar and a few minutes' patience, you'll have a picture of yourself just as you are now that'll last... Take advantage now, tomorrow could be too late. Now hold still, please. Hold still, please. You know, I never had my picture taken. Now's a good a time as any. ...eight, nine, ten, 11, tw-- No, no, no. No, no, no. Now a little more to the left. No... Now, now... Now... this way. There you are. Good. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. No, no, no. Now, don't move. Now, that's right. This way you won't get tired. Uh-huh. Now, lean on it. That's it. There. Huh... See how simple it is? Magnificent. Stupendous sight, but I know what's missing. Just a minute. It costs only a few cents more, but wait till you see the effect. Uh-huh. Now, perfect. Hold still now, please. Just a matter of seconds. Uh-huh. One... Mm-hm. ...two, three... ...four, five, six, seven... Looking at you, I don't know which one is the pigeon.... nine... ...ten, 11... You moved! Oh, my dove! That's the only one I have! Forget it. Now, why don't you get smart? Why should I? 'Cause I say so. Come on, let's get him. Come on, hold him down. The suits they make nowadays. They sure aren't worth a damn. I've had enough fun. Let's go get our money at the bank, and get ourselves out of this lousy village. That's it. Look at that, would you? They sure got nasty folks around here. They hang people too. I'll repeat it for the last time. Yes or no? I want an immediate answer. All right, so you're not interested. Do you, or don't you want to understand, I'm giving you an opportunity to-to save your neck from that damned rope. When I give my word, I keep it. I said tonight and tonight someone will get you out of here. You'll have to take care of the rest. But if I know you, you'll find a way to recover the money those sons of bitches stole from me. I lost a partner recently. If you're interested, you can take his place. We were friends once. We can be again. It's up to you and you know it. All you have to do is--Where can I find them? As far as I know, they're still in town. They're in no hurry. Hi, Charlie.Hi, fellas. Gonna rain soon, we need it. I got something to tell ya. Well, why don't you boys just sit down and have a drink? I just had a bottle delivered to me... Get moving. The sooner we get outta here, the better it is. Come on, hurry! I said hurry up. You... I wonder if it works. Come on! Let's go. It works. Pretty, isn't it? Beautiful, while it lasts. I told you this afternoon... You told me too much. In my opinion, you're getting old. Once, you used to count your words. But this afternoon, you told me so much... I almost forgot to ask about our mutual friends. Our friends? Still not thinking of that old story, are you? No. Simple curiosity. You know, 15 years of hard labor sort of cuts into your social life. What are they doing now? Where are they? Around here? No. Paco went back to Mexico years ago. Years ago? And Drake? What about Drake? He settled in Fair City near Memphis. Went into business. Big business, huh? Yes, he's gone up in the world. But as far as you're concerned, you don't need them. I'm here to help you any way--I know, I know. You're here to help me make up for the lost time. You told me. You told me. You like 'em? What? Classy, huh? And comfortable too. If it weren't for these, I would've made a mistake tonight. Hmm? I would not have noticed... this instead. What do you know? My eyes fell on this just as I was putting my boots on. You know, it's bad taking too many precautions. That's better. You know, the idea of killing a deputy with my knife... wouldn't have come from the kind of people you sent. But from a more refined mind. I no sooner finish those 15 years when I'm beaten up in a saloon and robbed of my knife. And while I'm asleep, that knife winds up in somebody's chest. Somebody I don't even know. And that little detail the law overlooks. And before I know it, I'm behind bars again. Those two you sort of hinted you wanted taken care of, they must've given you a rough time. If after you get a rope around my neck without dirtying your hands, you suddenly change your filthy mind all in the name of old friendship, you say. Actually, it's because those two sort of took the shine off your image. And you had no one on hand quick enough to restore it by finishing them off. Isn't that it, partner? You keep on the side of the law. But me, with a jail-breaking charge and the departed soul of a deputy hanging over my head, easy to handle, you must've thought. You're out of your mind. Out of my mind? Prove it to me. Prove to me you won't double cross me the way you did 15 years ago. Or the way you did just one month ago. Do I make myself clear, partner? This time I want proof. Concrete proof. What proof? Yeah. Ha-ha-ha. What? There. That's proof enough for me. Buy myself a nice little farm. A few head of cattle, not many. I'll have enough income left to live on for 100 years, income. Got any idea what income is? You put the money in the bank, and every month, the bank pays you interest. You go to sleep, and meanwhile, the interest is growing. You go fishing, and the interest increases. And your capital stays untouched. You sleeping? If you'd keep quiet, maybe I could. It takes a smart man to understand you. You put your hands on a mountain of money, no strings attached, and for you it's the most natural thing in the world. And you sleep. Just sleep. Hi. Hello, friends. There's a rumor you just cleaned out a bank. It so happens, I had savings in that bank. Never mind the jokes. Oh, don't take it so badly. You're both young and strong. Me, I have to make up for so much wasted time. There are many things I have to attend to. So don't worry, I just need a small amount. Just enough for the bare necessities. Hmm? Well, no... Money corrupts men, it softens them. So to keep you young and pure, I think I'll take everything. You'll thank me for this someday. Listen, before you go, there's one thing I'd do, if I were you. What is that? Shoot me. What a nice idea. The world is too small for you to get far enough away from me. I'll find ya sooner or later. Listen, Tiny, you must have worms in your brain. Now, Cacopoulos just doesn't go around shooting people just to have something to do. Then give me a loaded gun. Oh, no. I can't do that. My grandfather always used to always say: "Even if you have a small advantage, be careful not to lose it. In the best of circumstances, you'll be considered a fool." And I always find myself in trouble if I don't follow my grandfather's advice. So long, friends. Hyah! Shoot me. You shoot me. A peasant! You see a peasant on a dirty donkey, and a minute later you're lying ass-up on the ground! Without having the time to say, "Ouch!" Letting ourselves be fooled like amateurs! My farm! My interest sitting in the bank! Shoot me, Cat! Come on, shoot me! What're you waiting for? Shoot me! Shoot me! Hey. Wait a minute. What're you doing? Have you gone loco? Put down the gun, Cat. Then you save your breath. We have 30 miles to do before we see a living soul. Stay here. They need water and food, I'd say. Ha! The murrain falls on us and before Jim and I can make out what's going on, all the bulls and cows are in pasture with their legs straight up like pegs. And we're left with just about nothing. Well, we were worse off than when me and my old lady came here 30 years ago. Worse off, indeed. Without a penny for a blind man's song. That's how it was. I was just thinking of finishing myself off when guess what happens? What happened? A miracle! That's what happened! Guess who appears in front of me? Who appeared in front of you? Our Savior! Oh, well, it didn't look like him. He gets off his horse, and he says to me: "Hey, old man, you look worse than an undertaker without a job." So while he's eating, because he looks hungrier than you did, I tell him all my troubles. Of course I'm just letting off steam, and he don't even seem to be listening to me. When all of a sudden he comes out with a big laugh and he says: "Is 5,000 enough?" And I says, "What?" And then he says, "Write out a receipt. I have an idea that you're going to get a loan from Cacopoulos." Pa wandered the state. But Mr. Cacopoulos is a man who likes to see happy people around him. So he left with a strange man, who earns his living walking on a rope 100 feet above the ground. And he went into town with his wagon for the fair. We don't hurry that crook won't have a cent left. Nice to give to charity when it's other people's money. Quiet, please. This is very dangerous. Thank you. Quiet, please. What's the matter with you? Why you little bitch, come here. Get your hands off me! Please, help! Let go! Please let go! Skip it. He needs a dozen like you before he even starts having fun. Even if you're an idiot, I don't see why you wanna die so young. I'll join you, if you don't mind. All right. If somebody's ready to start. I warned ya. He left last night. Told us he was going all the way to Tula on the other side of the border. He said he had an old account to settle. Did he... Did he give you a loan too? To tell you the truth, he offered me one. But I refused. We've always been able to make it on our own. At least until today. You'd have done all right today too. You certainly didn't need us to handle those guys. Thank you. You're very kind. Mr. Cacopoulos too is very kind. He seems to want to make everybody happy. And that's very nice of him. Except it seems to me it's very hard to make everybody happy. It seems to me that Mr. Cacopoulos is not very thrifty. Well, I think it's about time we got goin'. It looks like this is it. You like to bet? This fiesta, we're payin' for it. You can count on it. Is he dead, that one there? No, not dead. Is-is good to us. Not dead. Ha-ha-ha. No, señor. If I could get my fingers around his neck... Mmm... Listen, Miguel, I wanna play a joke on those two gringos over there, see 'em? Take it easy, this stuff'll knock you right out, if you're not careful. Not me. To hell with it, it's me that's payin'! Now then, piece of paper, huh? You ugly little cockroach, I'm gonna kill you! We can't talk in here. Let's-- Let's go outside. I can't hear you. We got nothin' to say to each other. Just spit out my money and fast! And if I don't? I wouldn't be carrying it with me anyway. It's no use lookin' for Cat. By now he's about ten miles from here thinkin' he'll find me. What do you mean, huh? Follow me. You know, Tiny, in your condition I could lay you out flat, very quickly without any trouble. Why don't you try? Shh! Shh! During my travels I was thinking. I decided to give you back your money. All of it. I don't need it any more. Sure, you done nothin' else but spread it around. Small change. And anyway, I'll give you back even that. There's somebody here who owes me a big debt. To have debts owed you is one thing. Shh. To collect them is another. He'll pay. All I want is you two to leave me alone till I get it. And then I'll give it back to you, seeing as you care so much about it. It seems money's nothing to you, I guess. You're wrong. Once I was convinced there was something more important. I... Try to imagine that you have three friends. That you've shared everything with 'em since you were a boy. Even these. Imagine one day you clean out a bank. And while you get away, half the town on your heels, one of your good friends pulls out a gun and shoots your horse out from under you. And then they shout: "You hold 'em off till we catch our breath, then we'll come back and free you." Fifteen years I waited for them. Doing hard labor. And the best part is they didn't forget. Oh, no. They were waiting till I got out so they could send me straight to hell. Lower me gently into a nice new grave and put a stone on my head. But... these friends of yours, how many did you say there are? Shh. Two. There were three, I took care of the first. Shh.And the second? Paco? It's his turn tomorrow. I don't like to look on the dark side, but suppose instead of your friend Paco it's you who gets shot? Would you explain to me why I have to go through hell just to get back what's mine? You don't trust me? I have another idea. What? If you want, you can come with me. Sure, sure. Why not? The two of us together, it'd be easy as child's play. Well now, that's a wonderful idea. Shh! Another one. Enrique Ramirez Sanchez Cornejo y Mendoza. The charge? He refused the opportunity to fight for the liberty and independence of our great country. For the defense. A pig. The jury? Rebel. Rebel. He's a rebel. Guilty. Another one. Ramirez Fernandez Sanchez Eugenio y Mendosa. Take your hat off! Just like you said, huh? It's gonna be child's play. Leave it to me. Leave it to me, huh? Buddy, I didn't force you to come. Those are my friends from Tula, I underestimated them. You see, some friends are better than others. I wouldn't be so sure, if I were you. Open the gate! Open the gate! ...the gate! Aah! Take care of that damn machine gun! How did you manage to get all these people together? I told them Cacopoulos had a lot of money hidden somewhere. Look how they're guarding his life. Through the gates, men! Through the gates! Come on, men, follow me! Follow me! Cover him! Cover him! Where the hell is he goin'? All right, come on. Jump! Wait, wait! Here we are! Just the two of us, all alone! I spit on your mother! Not for long. Wait, wait! Did you make him... give back the money? I forgot. Mmm. Don Pedro Ramirez Maria Santiago Gutierrez. Charge? He wanted to fight for the freedom of our country. Guilty! Another one! Jimenez Maria Ortega Manolo del Fraile... From what I can see now, we have to share with all these people, huh? Nice idea you had. Yeah, now that you mention it, it would've been better if I'd never had it. At least I'd be free of two imbeciles. Mmm. If only this imbecile would make up his mind to talk. He'll talk. Let them finish their patriotic duties and you'll see. Cangaceiro doesn't have the tender heart you have, you ox. No! No! I wouldn't like to be in your shoes. Look at the mess you put us in, idiot. You and your fantasies. You're out of your head. Don't think I'll lift a finger when they separate it from your neck! "You'll get it all back, even the pennies. There's somebody around here that owes me a big debt." Then, when he gets that swindler in his hands, he kills him without even giving him the time to sign a piece of paper! Coffee's boiling. I'd like a cup. Did you hear that? Mr. Cacopoulos wants coffee. And how'd you like it? With sugar or without? Mmm. Without. Huh! Well this time, Mr. Cacopoulos will have to make an exception. Open your mouth. What's the matter, too hot? Hmm. Cacopoulos. What kind of name is that? A Greek name. My grandfather was a Greek. He was a Greek, like Sophocles, Aristophanes, Plato, Homer. And like Ulysses, he had to keep traveling. He never suffered from homesickness, my grandfather. Oh, no. And so... he left the schooner on which he had embarked and continued his travels on foot. Bouncing from place to place, trading in skins, until he came to a Cherokee tribe. And there he was admired by an Indian girl, or he admired her, I don't know which. But the fact is, among other children, my father too was born. And he grew up and raised a family in a small mining town. And he had just the time to do it... when someone shot him dead. And my grandfather, told of it, had to get his son's body... and he had to take me too, still teething, back to his tribe. And I cried. And I cried. And I cried. Who cried? He had some very strange ideas, my grandfather. What ideas? "I advise you", he said, "never tell lies. It means you fear those facing you." Shh. "On the other hand, never tell the truth either. In the best of cases they'll put you on a cross like they did someone centuries ago." That's what'll happen to you, if you don't cut it short. He wasn't such a fool, your grandpa. I'd like to know what his advice would've been tonight. "If you have a loaf of bread," he would've told me: "no matter how large, don't cut it into thin slices, or else you'll wind up with an empty stomach." Yes, he was really a wise old man, your grandpa. Then it's agreed? Yes. Huh? Quick, untie him. We'll have to borrow three horses. Hey, you try anything funny and... All right. Heh. This way, mis hombres! Don't shoot him! My grandfather used to say: "One ally's not enough, two is too many!" Try not to get yourselves killed, my friends. I would be very sorry! Hyah! He already told me that damn story. Hyah! Hyah! Bienvenidos. Mr. Cacopoulos knew you'd make out all right. He left me the job of burying three of them. This one is the last. He says he hasn't finished yet. He still has one to kill. He's very, very sorry. He says don't worry. He says thanks for all you done. He says hello, folks! Hurry up, ya hear, I'm hungry. Hey, have a look. Haven't I seen that other one somewhere before too? Yeah. On top of a rope. Ooh! Ah, what? What the...! Hey! Hello, friends! It sure took you a long time. Where? Ah, wait a minute, calm down. Where? Whoa. This is no time to lose your temper. Where? You don't want to get mad.Where is it? Now, wait. Now, we'll talk in minute. Where? Wait. There! What's that? A bank maybe? Safer. A gambling house. You mean...? You mean to say...? I mean, I mean, I mean to say... yes. I lost it, all, every penny of it. But you don't have to worry.I think I'll kill him. Will you listen to me, huh? Yeah, I'll kill him! It won't help. Even so I'm gonna kill you! If you listen to me I'll-- Take it easy, Hutch. Take it easy. If you'll listen to me I've something to tell you. Sure, only I'm gonna kill him. Oh, you mad killer. Ooh! I didn't do it. You know, gambling is a terrible vice. What are you doin' in a kitchen? Earning money to eat with. In Fair City, people with money only think about gambling. That's all they're interested in. My act was going great till they started having fun betting whether I'd fall or not. Are you ready to listen to me now? We're all ears. Drink up, Shorty. It's not as bitter a pill as you think. Hmm? So I traveled for a time, here and there until I find where the third friend is. You and your damn lies. You came here straight as an arrow. And leave your grandfather and his darned advice out of it! All right. All right. I knew where Drake was, and I came here, straight as an arrow. But he's a hard nut to crack. Here we go again, huh? Just let him talk. So I-- I couldn't settle the question right away. I begin snooping around, and I end up at the casino. And that too belongs to my old friend. So as not to attract attention, I-I place a few bets. I like it. And when I really start enjoying myself... You went and got cleaned out. From what I've heard around, those people play rough. Mr. Cacopoulos got cleaned out before he realized it. He sure had a lot of money to start with. There's something very strange going on in that shack. Washing dishes brings ideas. And sure enough, I get one. And that's why I was waiting for you. Listen to that, he was even impatient. Out with the idea. Fifty on the red. All right, gentlemen, last call. This is the last call, gentlemen. Checkroom's over there. How much money do you have? Change it. And if I lose? Be careful. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. All bets down. No more bets please. Eight. The gentleman's number is eight. All side bets down. Going for eight. Thirty-four red. My friend, I'll make you rich tonight. I'm on a lucky streak! But-- Hey... Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. Please place your bets. All bets are down. No more bets, please. No more bets. Twenty-six black. Fair pass. My grandfather used to say there's one way to make money. Forget it, forget it. That's it, boy, get in there, boy! Do you think this is the moment to waste time around here? Go get him! Come on, let's go! Go on. Ring the gong. Sorry, gents. Sorry. Twenty-five dollars, I say twenty-five dollars to anyone able to knock out this great champion from Mississippi, Tommy Glancing Blow, in a regular boxing match, the new sport so popular in England today. Come on, boys. I can't believe you haven't got the guts. Well? My offer not enough? Okay, I'll double it. Fifty dollars. Fifty dollars, boys. I'm not fooling you... I'm talking fifty big dollars. Let's see it.Certainly, sir, by all means. The gentleman is of little faith, and he is in his rights to check. Our motto is faith and trust. My dear sir, since faith is the soul of commerce, thus we don't want to see your five dollars until the end of the match in the unhappy event you lose. Step right up, sir. Uh... Not me. Him. What's going on? Silence, folks, a little silence and let's free the ring. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the heavyweight champion from Missouri, Hutch Bessy, in a fight to the finish under the Marquis of Queensbury rules. Come on, Hutch, we're dependin' on you. Go on, go on! Now throw the punch, Hutch! Don't forget the fifty! Come on, Hutch! Hutch, hit him! Hit him! That's the way to do it there! Go on, Muscles! Come on! Give it to him! Come on, get in there. Come on, Hutch! You won't miss! Get him! Hit him, Tommy! What'd you mean hit him? My man's gonna knock him flat! Finish him off! Let's go! Come on! Oh! Hutch won! Hey, that was it. Good bye! And what's this? Huh? A people-leveler, sir. What? When it goes off, it's better to be the one directly behind it. What do you mean? Oh, this sprays bullets. Huh. The Sheriff says you can't tie a rope on the roof of the gamblin' house. If he'd given me the right permit, we wouldn't be needin' this. Do you still feel like it? This is no joke. Save your breath.All right. I said, "Get outta my house. I never wanna see you again." A wife should stay in her place, instead of criticizing everything her husband does. But do you think she understood that? Hell no. You can't blame a man for going out nights, playing cards and drinking a little. And why shouldn't he give her a hard time when he gets home? If he didn't, she'd never let him get to sleep. That's right. Here, gimme the bottle. What a mess women get you in... Say... Save some. What would a man do without friends? Come on, come on, come on. Give up a horse for a woman and you never get back in the saddle. I'll drink to that. Now! Hey, you see? There's nothin' to it. Pick it up and get rid of it. I'll bet you couldn't do that. Psst! Now remember, this is the last.I know, I know. The very last! You told me, I know. When you play, one bet only on one number, any number. You told me, you, you already explained it, I know. The fact that I explained it to you doesn't mean you understood. I underst-- I understand. I wait till the place opens tomorrow night. I go in like a newborn baby. I change the money. I make a bet. I play any number... And for at least one day, you'll have to keep your mouth shut. Hmm! CAT: Your gun. What? Come on, we're wasting time. I'd feel naked without it! Oh, and another thing. This time if you get even one little idea in that worm-eaten head of yours... I'll kill you. He's not like me, you know. He'll do it. But this doesn't explain anything. The explanation must be in the cellar. Look. Simple, isn't it? Mm-hm. Thomas, go up into the garret and say something into that tube we saw. A magnet. Two people are enough to control the game. One above who decides the winning number, and one here, who places this on the same number. Evidently, the little ball contains a small amount of iron to make it obey. Put your ear to that thing. Ninety-nine! Don't yell, idiot. Don't yell! THOMAS: I wasn't yellin', Hutch. All right, Thomas, come down. You understand now?I'm not a fool. Now all we have to do... is wait. Wanna go upstairs? Buy me a drink? A drink? Uh-huh. Here we go. Okay. Take it easy. Instead of bringin' him to his senses, you'll kill him. But they're only love taps. That's what you think. Everything all right? Dead? Well, tie him up, and if you have any trouble, knock twice, but softly. This thing's more sensitive than it looks. Now be careful. Here come the pigeons. Good evening, sir. Evening. A little music never bothered anyone, don't you agree? Now, you'll have to tell us a few things, right? I've got a family. Exactly. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen, place your bets. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen, place your bets. Place your bets please, get your chips on the numbers... Damn it, all I want to know is where the hell that imbecile is. Ooh! Ooh! You can't do it! I haven't earned a dollar in three or four weeks. I don't have it. A debt owed is a debt to be paid. It's your problem, Al. Wait until Saturday. Afraid not. I can tell by the look in your eye you're dying for a little game. I never play. It's a habit of mine. Well, it's time we changed those bad habits. Shall we sit down? Don't worry. Nobody'll see us. We'll play a little game of cards, huh? A very simple game. Hold up your hand like that. One for you, one for me. You have a ten, I have a six. You win. Queen for you, king for me. I win. 'Course the ace is always high. You like it? Hmm? No! Now you like it? Yes. All right, come on. We haven't got much time to lose. Come on, smile! Gambling's good for the spirit. Three for you, five for me. I win, huh? Looks good for me. Ten for me. I win, huh? Nine for you, three for me. I win again. Hey! King for you, nine for me. I win, huh? Six, eight. I still win. Here he comes, flat-headed idiot. Thank you. Now watch out. The real game's gonna start. Hi. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen, place your bets. Thirteen. Thirteen. Here we go. The gentleman would like to have some change. All bets down please. No more bets, no more bets. I pay 13 black. Here you are, mister, $1,750. Lemme see. Hah! Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen, place your bets. Place your bets, please. Get your chips on the number down there. Uh, leaving it all, sir? Leave it all, leave it all! Go on. All hell's gonna break loose. Right. Thirteen black. Thirteen black wins again! Pay it. That man won 13 black twice in a row! What the hell's goin' on? Let's check upstairs. Right. Let's go. ....which we have chosen for our city, Law and Order, is the expression of an ideal by which I've lived, well long before I came to settle here with you. Nay, these words, Law and Order, have been, are, and always will be the very basis of my life. Thank you. And, uh... So I want to thank you for the honors that you've bestowed upon me tonight and especially Mr. Piggot. Mr. Piggot, whose cascade of flowery phrases has warmed the cockles of my heart. A round of applause for Mr. Piggot. Just a second. Let's hear what Mr. Drake still has to say. Uh... We can't accept bets over $10,000, sir. Why? The house limit is 10,000. And how much does that come to if I win? Three hundred and sixty thousand dollars. Really? All right. Heh, heh. You get that thing spinning. Still on, uh, number 13? Yeah. It'd be a miracle! I believe in miracles. The fool doesn't even try to keep up appearances. Thirteen again. Thirteen again. No bets down after the first turn of the wheel. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen, place your bets, please. Place your bets. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen, place your bets, please. All bets down, please. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen, place your bets. Place your bets, please. You better play regular. By all means. Certainly. Wait! Wait for me! Drake! Drake, don't leave me! Drake! Wait! Wait for me, Drake! They're coming! Don't leave me, Drake, they're coming! Thirteen! Ah! Pay him. I can't pay it all, Mr. Drake. He just broke the bank. Pay him! And send for the sheriff. I know this fellow very well. I wouldn't be in such a rush if I were you. Oh, so it's a hold-up, eh? In a way, but not by us. Am I right? Or would you like to have the sheriff look around? Maybe in the garret. What's all this about? If I may give a little advice in this situation, I'd resolve it in only one way. All right. Slow down, gents. Drop your belts. If I were you, I'd just take it easy. Your way of doing things is gonna bring you bad luck, Your Highness.Don't you touch him. Remember, he's mine! All right, Caco. Now then, Your Highness, will you have this man who won fair and square paid off? Why don't you take care of it afterwards? No, this time we'll do it our way. Or you got something against that? All right, as long as you do it quickly. Easier done than said. Don't forget the small change. I wonder if it works? It works, only I wouldn't use it if I were you. What? You're getting your money back. That's fine. But what about us? If this gambling house is really crooked, these yellow-bellies have been tricking us for years. Let's take a look into this dirty set-up. And if what the man said is true, we'll make sure he gets what's coming to him. No! You should've thought of this before! Get down, all of ya! Down! They leave, and we're finished. These animals will tear us apart. Mm-hmm.What are you muttering about? I was saying it would be better if you did leave. After all, it would be impossible for me to fight against a Negro on equal terms. Have I made myself clear? Now, Maurice, I beg of you to make an exception to this case. After all, the color of a man's skin is sometimes nothing compared to well, a specimen like this. A lice-infected jailbird. Who walks in where he obviously doesn't belong. And takes over as if he owns the place. Am I right, Cacapopoulos? Or whatever the hell it is you call yourself now. Am I right? Is that a man? A real man? Hmm? B-but you were once my friend. You hear that, Maurice? You tell me if it's possible. As far as I know, the only feeling that you could possibly arouse is one of, uh... hmm... pity. Oh, you still scratch yourself, do you? See? You've talked too much even for me. Come on, gents, here's your artillery. Give it to them too. The checkroom's an arsenal. Let's go. Get a move on. Well, we'll have to have some sort of a signal, won't we? We'll use this. When it stops. Huh? Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute. Fifteen years I've dreamed of this moment. Fifteen years. Every night. Every night... And so? There's always music. The music of violins. A slow, sweet waltz. I want music. He wants music. Play it! Need anything else? Clown. A rope around that fine, perfumed neck. Think about it. Not a bad idea, huh? A beautiful rope you can see through the bars of the cell they'll put you in. A good, strong rope waiting for you. Calling to you. Hey, you won't change your mind, huh? No, I told you. You can count on it. My grandfather used to say... I bet that imbecile got himself killed. Then I'll get you a hundred he didn't. Okay? Mm-hm. I think you lost, Hutch. Don't move! The last wish of an old friend must be respected. Don't you agree?
