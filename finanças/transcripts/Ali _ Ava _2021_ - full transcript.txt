Never thought she'd go for someone like me, you know, rough and ready. Cos she's from quite a well-to-do family. Bangladeshi. She's seeing this fella. Didn't get with him till after we lost the baby. You know, it's not his, it's mine. Don't think badly of her, er, it's just... - I don't. - Yeah. We're separated. We live in the same house for now, but separate bedrooms. My family don't know.

Didn't think you'd come. Why here? I come every month for the new moon. My dad used to bring me, but, look, waxing half-moon tonight. Paul's buried here. Oh, shit. I'm sorry, I didn't... No, it's all right. He used to beat me to fuck. Put his boots on to do it. When he started on our Michelle, that's when I left him. Callum don't know, though. What? That he hurt our Michelle. Her dad's Indian, Paul were a skinhead. A member of the National Front. Do you know what I did? No. One time, he came back drunk and I knew he were gonna start. So I went and got his boots for him. Cos I knew if I didn't, then he would. And I were scared he were gonna hurt Michelle again. And after he beat me black and blue... I looked at them boots and I thought, "How could someone as strong as me do that?" It was one of those moments that changes you. So I kicked him out. I went back to college and I did a degree.

My dad were all right with Kulvinder, but he stopped talking to me when I got with Paul. My dad hated the British. Callum blames me for him dying. He says his drinking got worse when I left him, but I had to leave him. - So, here you go. - Yeah, right. - Night. - Yeah, night. What's up? - Can we talk? - Yeah. Sometimes I just can't switch off.
