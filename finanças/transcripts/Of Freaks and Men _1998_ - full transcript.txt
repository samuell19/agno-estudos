CTB FILM COMPANY SOYUZKINO PRESENT SERGEI MAKOVETSKY VIKTOR SUKHORUKOV LIKA NEVOLINA DINARA DRUKAROVA ALYOSHA DE and CHINGIZ TSYDENDAMBAYEV IN THE NEW DRAMA OF FREAKS AND MEN Johann passes through Immigration Control and enters the town. Dr. Stasov adopts the Siamese twins. Engineer Radlov and his wife photograph their daughter Leeza. Years went by. After the death of his wife, Radlov lived with his daughter Leeza, and their maid, Grunya. You can't bring Mama back, Leeza. They're leaving... We'll go as well. To the West? I promised, didn't I? Yes, Papa. That'll be the records. Good day. Have you come to see Papa? I'll call him. Papa, there's someone to see you. Ah, Johann. Have you brought it? No. But...then? I've come to see Grunya. Grunya? Grunya was Johann's sister, but she kept this a secret. She knew all about her brother's occupation. That's all. Hello. So that's what you do here, Mr. Kohl. You won't fool me anymore! I saw everything! Everything! I won't permit it! I simply won't! I didn't rent the studio to you for that! There are respectable people living here! There's no room for your kind here! Wait... Putilov, have you brought it? What? Leave the camera. Viktor Ivanovich sold the photographs that were taken in Johann's studio. What do you want? Don't come here. What is it? Who's in there? Daria, who's there? It's for me. Go away. What are you doing? And the money? Later. You?ll get your money. Go away! Daria! Yes. Who was it? It was for me, a relative from my village... But why come to the front door? Yekaterina Kirillovna, it won't happen again. Kolya, you sing the lead. What's that? A relative from my village came. Right, from the beginning, with the introduction. Kolya, pay more attention, you keep cutting in on the Lead. Boys, have you seen my stethoscope? Andrei, can't you see that we're busy? Katenka, forgive me, but I have to go on my rounds, and I've no stethoscope. You're going out? I'll be back for supper. Yekaterina Kirillovna did not love her husband. She carried on only for the adopted twins. Again, from the beginning... As the bell rings monotonously The road get dusty and through the field The coachman sings his song The coachman sings his song There is so much feeling in his song That my heart burns up in my cold chest... Excuse me, have you come to see us? No. Leeza. Hello, Leeza. Is papa home? Yes, in the study. Thank you. Leeza, Nikolai Nikolayevich is waiting for you. Leeza, meet Putilov. Undoubtedly the cinema is the thing, no doubt about that, my friend! The cinema may become a real art form, an art form accessible to the people of whom you speak. Not painting, not literature, not photography, but the cinema will reveal truth to the common folk. You yourself saw what effect moving pictures have on common people. So your photography will die out. Shortly you'll see how everything will change. We're on the verge of something major, something new. The cinema is only the beginning. Excuse me. It's all right, Grunya. It won't be long now. Leeza is already grown up... Grunya. What was that? They're fueling the steam engines. Do you like photography? That must be the records. Is that me? Ah, you've brought it. It's my gift to you on this special occasion. It's turned out well. It's a present. Take it, take it. It's me at age five. To become a photographer, Putilov got himself into debt. So he became dependent on Johann. Putilov, you should be on your way. It's already late. Yes, yes. Could I, perhaps, photograph you? Leave me alone. Take the boys to the cinema. Johann readied himself to make a wedding proposal. Is Leeza home? Leeza? Grunya, who's there? It's Johann. But why through the front door? Hello. Never, never set foot in this house again... Scum! Don't let him in again! Scum! In this village... In this village, my father your grandfather, was born. Whereas I was born in a town... right here. Where was Mama born? Mama? Mama, Mama, Mama... Andrei, it's for you. Excuse me, I won't be long. Speaking. Yes... Yes, Grunya, of course. When? Take a look. No, don't do anything. Do you have any ice? It's disgusting. Order some ice. Have you got any more? There are more. Yes, yes. Where's Leeza? Do you want to touch? Go on. So, Mama... Mama was born here... in this town. Boys, engineer Radlov's heart is acting up. I must go. Leeza! Wait! Putilov, what an odor! Thank you, Semyon Markovich. Excuse me for having troubled you. We'll have to clarify certain points. I'll phone you. I'm sure you'll be able to manage without me. However, I disagree with your decision. Why did you get up? The doctor said you mustn't. I've made a few changes in my will. It will be a surprise for you. It's a bit early for you to be worrying about a will. What'll you think of next! I think you should take a look at the photographs I found in Leeza's things... Photographs? Come on then, come on. Viktor Ivanovich couldn't get the twins off his mind. I told you not to come here! Quickly! Is the master home? He's not here. But the mistress is home. Go on, get out. Where are you going? Go away! Go! If she sees you... I'll be punished. What are you doing? Go away, go away. Where are the freaks? What freaks? Daria... Have you run a bath? Daria? Who's here? Viktor Ivanovich. Viktor Ivanovich? Viktor Ivanovich. Turn around. Mama?! What do you want? Viktor Ivanovich. Yekaterina Kirillovna had fallen in love for the first time. The addition from the 17th of May of this year. The heretofore mentioned Elizaveta NikoIayevna Radlova will receive the benefits of her inheritance upon her entry into lawful wedlock with such person as she, Elizaveta Nikolayevna Radlova, of her own free will shall deem fit. Until such time, all heretofore mentioned assets, monies, stocks and shares, and the like, will be administered by an appointed trustee, Gardena Spiridonovna Bosykh, who shall act on my behalf to safeguard the heretofore mentioned properties. Established on the 17th of may of this year in sound mind and good health. The engineer wanted Grunya to replace Leeza's deceased mother. Leeza, I will save you. Putilov, you should be off. It's already Late. Yes, yes. Leeza! Hello. Hello. This way, that's it. Nanny! What? What do you want? This is my nanny! Leave me alone! Go away! Hello, Leeza. Putilov, you should be on your way. Yes, yes. Behind Johann's back, Viktor Ivanovich began his business. Ready? Hello. A cinema! May I use it to photograph? Some film. I need a dark room. What? Yes, it's me. We won't marry. Grunya! Make sure it's the same as in the pictures. Go on! Nanny! Why have you done such naughty things? Don't you know that it's bad? As it's your first time, I won't punish you too severely. There, my dear... Let that be a lesson to you. Leeza... I'll save you! It's too late, Putilov. Leeza, I'll save you. And so Leeza became a woman for the first time. Where are they? Where are they? Where are they? Where are they? Where are they? Tell me! Tell me! It's Dr. Stasov. Are you hiding something? Viktor Ivanovich hated and feared Johann. They sing. Go on! Make the bald one leave. What? As the bell rings monotonously The road get dusty and through the field The coachman sings his song The coachman sings his song There is so much Feeling in his song That my heart burns up In my cold chest In my cold chest As I remember those nights Those fields and those forests A tear comes to my eyes That have been dry for so long That have been dry for so long As the bell rings monotonously I can hear it from far away My coachman has stopped singing My coachman has stopped singing My freaks will live here for the time being. Here? What is it? Drink it. I won't. Drink it, freak. Find Putilov. Forgive us, please. Tolya isn't like that really. Tolya? And who are you? I'm Kolya. What's your name? Leeza. Nanny! What's that? The snow is shining In the moonlight A team of horses Is rushing through the night Ding, ding, ding ding, ding, ding A little bell rings And talks to me At early Spring The moon is shining In the field A friend will stop Your young voice That sounds like a bell Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding Sweetly sings about love... I hate this town. Months went by. Leeza lived in one room with the twins. Kolya was hopelessly in love with her. Tolya drank on the sly. If you keep traveling toward the West, the sun never sets. Must you travel fast? We'll travel East. That's where papa was born. He'll find us. Check. I've brought you some wine. Where's mama? She left with the doctor. That's not true! Well, go on then! Tolya, don't drink it. Just a drop. What? Leeza. So, freaks! Let's go. Nanny! Why have you done such naughty things? Don't you know that it's bad? Viktor Ivanovich? Viktor Ivanovich, Viktor Ivanovich... Let's go then. Come on, come on. Viktor Ivanovich? Let's go. Where? Who's here? It's okay, it won't take long. That's it. Stand here. Viktor Ivanovich. Go on. Get on your knees. Nanny! I hate him. I hate him. I hate this dead town. I hate carrots with sour cream. Leeza! I'm sorry. Do you also think I'm a freak? Of course not! You're very handsome. I disgust you, I know. It's because of Tolya, isn't it? Because we're always together. But I'm normal. I saw papa's books. It doesn't happen like that. To love a woman, you don't have to whip her. I know how, I'll show you. Leeza, try, please! Tolya's asleep. Just once! He won't hear a thing. Try! You may never have another chance! I love you. And so Leeza became a woman for the second time. Putilov! Putilov! Leeza. My nanny's died. Nanny! So, freaks? It's all over. The twins left for the East. Are you coming? I'm heading toward the West. Cast off. We'll come to see you. We'll find Papa and then come. Forward. I'll be waiting! The famous doctor and physician, Andrei Fyodorovich Stasov, was born in this house. Papa. Gentlemen! After a short interval, as promised, the singing freaks will appear before you. Tolya, just a little further. What did you have to drink? Just a minute. How are you? Better? Can you sing? Quickly, open up! Tolya, wake up. Tolya, get up! Get up, Tolya. We gotta go. Get up, Tolya, come on. Open up now, freak! Get up! Tolya, get up! Tolya, get up! Tolya! Leeza traveled to the West. Would you like some music? I recommend it. Putilov! Look, it's Putilov! Johann visited the cinema. F. PUTILOV PUNISHMENT FOR A CRIME A REAL LIFE DRAMA Why have you done such naughty things? Don't you know that it's bad? As it's your first time, I won't punish you too severely. There, my dear... Let that be a lesson to you. THE END The snow is shining In the moonlight A team of horses Is rushing through the night Ding, ding, ding ding, ding, ding A little bell rings And talks to me At early Spring The moon is shining In the field A friend will stop Your young voice That sounds like a bell Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding Sweetly sings about love The snow is shining In the moonlight A team of horses Is rushing through the night Ding, ding, ding ding, ding, ding A little bell rings And talks to me Johann Sergei Makovetsky Leeza Dinara Drukarova Yekaterina Kirillovna Lika Nevolina Viktor Ivanovich Viktor Sukhorukov Kolya Alyosha De Tolya Chingiz Tsydendambayev Putilov Vadim Prokhorov Doctor Stasov AIexander Mezenstev Engineer Radlov Igor Chibonov Grunya Daria Lesnikova Daria Tatiana Polonskaya Producers Sergei Selyanov Oleg Botogov Director and Scriptwriter Alexei Balabanov Director of Photography Sergei Astakhov Designer Vera Zelinskaya Sound Maxim Belovolov Editing Marina Lipartia Costumes Nadezhda Vassilieva Make up Tamara Frid Executive Producer Maxim Volodin
