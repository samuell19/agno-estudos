Okay, man. You got me. What the fuck's wrong, officer? Hey. Read my fucking rights. Hey, what are you doing? Jesus. What the fuck's going on? Huh? Jesus Christ, what the fuck's going on? What do you want, what do you want from me? Oh, go on, Chris. I didn't mean to interrupt you. It's okay, Father. It was blasphemy, anyway. Father Now, come on, you're not that bad. I was thinking about quitting my day job. What do you think? Nervous about tomorrow? Why, do I look nervous? Hey, Father, do you think that you could, uh, say a prayer for me? Now? You're asking me to work overtime. For him. Well, all right, one blessing coming up. A short one, Chris. Please God, protect this boy, give him a sense of direction. Keep him from Satan and temptation. Give him the strength to know friends from foes, right from wrong, and good from evil. Please, dear God, help this boy become a man. Okay, people, moving on to item E. Last night, another winking corpse popped up in our neck of the woods. Shot in the left eye, same MO. Same gun, a PPK. We got ourselves a very active serial here, boys and girls, so let's cut down on the celebration, why don't we? And last, but least, I want you to welcome two new officers to our division. Fresh from the academy: Officer Ernest Pitts and Officer Chris O'Brien. Pitts will be riding with Clements, O'Brien gets Hugosian You lucky bastard. Okay, fellas, don't be shy. Tell us something interesting about yourselves. What brings you to the ranks of L.A.'s finest? Gee, Sarge, I don't really have much to say, you know? I never wanted to be a cop. When I was younger, I wanted to be an interior decorator, which, by the way, this place could use some work. Well, that is just perfect. That's exactly what we need around here, huh? Another goddamn clown. What about you, O'Brien? You gonna be a boy scout? Well, sir, I pretty much always wanted to be a police officer, and I promise this division 100 percent, and to fight crime with all my energy until there's nothing left to fight, sir. Hallelujah. Good luck with that fighting, kiddo. Dismissed, people. Come on, guys, let's give it 100 percent. Yeah I've gotta go out and fight crime. Hey, my name's Michael. Hey. I guess we're partners, huh? All right, let's party. O'Malley, if I were you, you know what I'd do? I'd go out right now and buy myself a lottery ticket or two. It's O'Brien. And why is that? It must be your lucky day, love. You know what they say on the job: "You're only as good as your partner." Hugs, Hugs is the best there is. That's what I say. Yeah, we used to ride together, too, and uh, it was a hell of a ride, believe you me. The only reason I'm still alive. Hugs saved my ass a few times, here and there. Well, well, well. Speak of the devil. Is that Hugosian? Yeah. Officer Hugosian? Excuse me, sir. Um, Chris O'Brien, your new partner. Oh, really? Well, I guess I better get in touch with my life insurance guy. They tell me you're the best cop on the force. They? And who's they? Don't believe everything "they" tell you. Except "they" happen to be right. What'd you say your name was? Excuse me? Your name? What'd you say it was, Chris, O'Brien? Yeah. Nora. Hugosian Call me Hugs. I'm sorry, ma'am. I... I don't usually dress like this, but sometimes in this precinct, you gotta be a whore. You know, undercover, a bust. Hey, it's okay to be an ass your first time out. You're going to be just fine. You look good in green. You know, Toast, don't ever make fun of my partner. Meet me in Unit 305. I'll be out in two. Chop, chop, partner. Yeah, you better watch out, man. Watch out. You know what they say about broads in uniform, don't you? They're either nymphos, lesbos, or psychos. Thanks for the tip, man. I got some rules. Not too many, but they're mine, and I like them. And they are? Don't question me. Don't second guess me, and do exactly what I tell you. Wow, you my partner or my mother? Don't talk to anybody but me. You got a problem with something, you come to me. And where do I go if I have a problem with you? You got a problem with me, you can go to hell. Having fun yet? Okay, I got a problem. Already? What? I don't know where we're going. 336 Normandie. There's where I live. I know. You drew these? - Yeah. - Very good. Very soulful. Why the hell did you become a cop? Cops don't have souls? Well, jury's still out on that one. No, seriously, what's with the career choice? Like to be armed and dangerous? Come on, open sesame. Was this your father? Yeah. He doesn't look like a cop. He wasn't, he was just a good guy. Died when I was eight, car jacking incident. Shot in the head. They recovered his Cadillac, but they never found the guys. So you thought that you might find his killers? No, I didn't. But you know, maybe I'll find somebody else's. How come you're a cop? Me? I like to be armed and dangerous. So, Rembrandt, what else do you do? You write poetry? Sculpt? Play the accordion? Need to know what my partner's combat skills are. Didn't you say something back there about making fun of your partner? This is not making fun. This is jawsy talking here. Well, ok, uh... I play a little organ in church. You happy? Speaking of little organs, take off your clothes. What? Look, we're going to be spending all this time together, I don't want us wondering what the other one's like. It's just too much tension. Come on. I won't bite you. Come on. What's that? It's a Scapular. It's supposed to protect me. Well, Rembrandt, I'm going to protect you now. I'm not feeling any less tense. Get dressed. Well, well, well. Barry Glover. What's shaking, handsome? Now, I thought I told you to take your dog and pony show out of here, out of my precinct. Yet, here we are again. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you got there, Barry? Come on, pull it out, nice and easy. You got a weapon in there, huh? You got a profit margin, what? Cigarette. Those things'll kill you. Fuck you, Hugs. I got people, and they all know who you are. So fuck you! How dumb is this guy? What, are you threatening me and my gun? Just talking. Yeah, I can see you're just talking. You got smoke coming out of your mouth. You know, he just waived his right to be silent. Cuff him. Turn around for me, sir. Fuck you! Outstanding warrants on all three. Looks like we did catch us some fishies. Yeah, don't get too excited. They'll be back in the sea tomorrow. Oh, man. Tell me I'm dreaming. You are dreaming, Hugs, and so am I. Whatcha doing here? I thought you'd still be in Queens taking big bites out of crime. There is no more crime in New York City. And the mayor ordered everybody to be nice to each other. I hate that. Yeah, so there's not much for a cop to do. That's a nice suit. Nice beard. Internal affairs? I don't know. It sounds more like a doctor than a cop to me. So you're here on business. Yeah, well, sort of. See, they give me this case, and I don't know what to do with it, because frankly, it sounds a little bit like a wild goose chase to me. You've heard about those left eye shootings? Yeah, Sarge calls them the winking corpses. Winking corpses? That's pretty good. Anyway, they got this hot shot gal detective on the case, what's her face, Dombrowsky. Oh, Cinderella of the LAPD. Well, Cinderella's on the ball. Found some tire prints at the scene, and lo and behold, it matches one of your black and whites. No shit? No shit. Do they know who was using it? It could be any one of you guys. Killer cop. Love it. Anyway, like I said, it's pretty much of a wild goose chase. So, kid, what do you call yourself? That's Chris O'Brien. He's my new partner. Really? Congratulations. Hugs is-- The best, I know, sir. Yeah, yeah, yeah, well the best needs a rest. Hertzel, it's good to see you. Good luck with your investigation. Be careful of that guy, he's a creep. I thought you guys were friends. He was my partner in New York. He's a nice guy and a creep. A little of this, a little of that. Can't be both. You learned that where? Catholic school, or the academy? A little of this, a little of that. 107, La Mona. What, what's that? My address. Pick me up at eight. -Pick you up? -Yeah. I don't have a car. I know, I know, it's LA, but I guess it's a New York thing. I like buses, I like subways, I like to look at people's faces instead of taillights. Um, why, why am I picking you up? Dinner. We'll have dinner. Conversation that may or may not lead to talking. Don't worry, doll, it's not a date. It's a cop thing. Impure thoughts? You're asking me to break. You're what, 22? Well, maybe they're not impure thoughts, but, maybe I just like her. I never met anybody like her before. She's... she's very, uh... So she's hot. Yeah. I mean, you know, I've lived with my mother most of my life, and ever since Dad died, she treats me like I'm this delicate flower or something. And your partner treats you like an equal. No, not, not, not yet. Not like an equal. Like, uh, like a man. Nora? Nora? Nora? Oh, shit. You okay? Give me my pills. One, they're in the cabinet. Come on! Yeah, yeah, the white bottle. You want me to call an ambulance? No, I'm fine. I just need to lay down. Endometriosis. What's that? Killer periods. Oh, man, it's just like a knife. Is it curable? Yeah, I gotta get knocked up. Shouldn't be a problem for you. It is. Most cops are pretty fucked up, you know? Well, there's a couple of civilians left. Forget about them. They either want you to fix their ticket, make some comment about police brutality, or some crap. Or they want to see your gun, or they don't want you to carry a gun, or they want to put your gun somewhere it doesn't belong. Can we just rest a little bit before we go to eat? Sure. Lie down next to me. What? I need your body, and I need your hand. Right here. I like it close. Yeah, yeah, just push. That's good. You know, uh, if Sarge saw this, he'd probably suspend us. Yeah, maybe he'd join in. What's up, Officer? Yeah, okay, I got it. Talk to you later. Thanks for coming, Hugs. They pay me by the hour. You must be Chris. Lynn Dombrowsky. How you doing? You got another one over here. Yeah, so I figured. Familiar face? Not anymore. Jesus Christ. Nope, Barry Glover. We arrested that guy yesterday. His sister took care of his bail, a few hours later, our shooter took care of his left eye. Time of death, 2:00 AM, plus or minus. Plot thin-ens. Sense of humor's good. But the IA guys aren't going to be laughing. You know I hate them as much as you do. I don't hate them. Why, should I? Barry Glover. He was your collar. Gee, I'll remember to wear black tomorrow. Just trying to give you a warning, because they're going to be all over you. What, because I arrested the guy? And the other three victims. They were all your collars. What, you figured that out all by yourself? Look, I'm not saying anything. But you are my only lead. And maybe this stuff's all coincidence, maybe not. Maybe someone's trying to set you up. Another cop, another collar. Well, I'm not good at maybes. Maybe that's why I'm not detective. Just keep your eyes open, okay? You, too, Chris. When I'm not asleep, my eyes are always open. Time of death, 2:00 AM. This city never sleeps. Neither do you. What's that supposed to mean? No, nothing, just you went out last night. At midnight. So what, you think I did it? No, I mean, I'm just worried about you, that's all. You're funny. Don't try so hard, Rembrandt. Listen, I understand you're new, you're trying to fit in, you're trying to be good. Just relax. It'll take a while. What, to become a good cop? To learn there's no such thing. Check. Yeah, come in. Play chess? Uh, no, sir. That's too bad. My neighborhood used to be, every kid was good at chess. That's what you would on Sunday mornings with your father, play chess with him. Sometimes he would let you win, you know. No, sir, I don't know. My family always went to church on Sundays. Chess is good for you. Gives you-- gives you perspective. See, nowadays, everything is relative, you know? Nobody likes to make a judgement, there's no right or wrong, everybody has a point of view. I can see your point, and-- you know? Chess, there's just two colors. Can't confuse your enemies and your friends. Like in church. Hmm. Just like in church. You wanted to see me, sir? You have heard about the latest development? Yes, sir, that uh, all the victims were Nora's collars. So you think that she's the shooter, just because of that? You know, back in New York, Nora and I were partners? I felt safe with her. She was my lucky charm. And I thought I was hers. She knew the streets. Loved the streets. She loved the system. You know, we bust our butts trying to nail some A-hole who was shooting at us, whenever he wants to shoot at us, and then finally, finally, we get him. Next day, back on the streets, shooting at us again. She never understood the concept. But, what are you going to do? Nada. Just go on, rock and roll with the punches. Well. One day, she wakes up, and she is fresh out of rock, and smack out of roll. Like she pulls a fuse or something, you know? Some spring pops out of her head. Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. The interesting question is why? Who knows why? The head, the heart, or the combo platter? She becomes edgy, paranoid. She's moving, she's always moving, like she's afraid to stop. Like if she stopped, she would have to think of something she didn't want to think about. You try riding around with a lucky charm like that, it's no picnic, I'll tell you. Sir, why, why are you telling me all this? I mean, Nora's my partner. Don't trust anybody, but... It's an old cliché. Aren't you two friends? Friends? Yeah, well... But what does that mean? The only thing it means is I ain't the one fucking her. What would you like me to do, sir? Keep my eyes open? Could you? When I'm not asleep, my eyes are always open. That's an excellent quality. Do you know what? I know her lines, and that is her line. Don't let Nora put her words in your mouth. Or, her other parts. Chris... Don't mess around. You see something, wake me up. So, you got a family? Nah. Not too many people would admit to being related to me. There is a couple of Armenians up in Frisco, who might give me a hot meal. What are you doing? What are you-- Hey, Rembrandt. Oh, is this supposed to be me? You're good, but I don't know. I'm not that pretty. Yeah, you are. Ah, I was just fishing. Oh man, I'm bored. Speaking of fish, let's go catch us some, right? Come on, someone break some laws. Pull over. Come on, stop, pull over. See that guy? You follow baseball? Charlie Sanders. He used to start for the Angels. Fuck, the guy was so amazing. Too bad they booted him for substance. Come on, let's go. You ever jimmy a lock before? No. What do they teach at the academy? Police, open up. How do you know where he went? Good friend of mine lives here, loves baseball. Come on, Hugs, tell me what's going on. Our Babe Ruth's a fucked up gun man. We've been after him for two years. He's probably armed, and definitely dangerous. Shouldn't we call for back up? Back up? Yeah, that's a good idea, he'll probably need it. Yeah? Police, Pablo. Fuck. Uh, wait a second, I'm naked here. Don't even think about the fire escape, Pablo. There's a unit out there. They're young and ain't never heard of a warning shot. Come on, man. Hey, Pablo. Wanna open the door all the way? Gonna invite us in? Sure, come in. What's going on, Pablo? Nothing, honest. Just been talking to my girlfriend here. Uh-huh? Must be hell of a conversation, what's she on? What do you mean, she's on the couch. That's really funny. Any other visitors? Where, here? Nah, nobody. Check the bathroom. I ain't lying to you officer. There ain't nobody else here. There's nobody else here. Clear. I don't really believe you. Get on the fucking floor, get on the fucking floor, get on the fucking floor right now, right now! So there's no one else here, huh? No one else has been here, just you, Carmela, and the roaches, is that right? Honest to Jesus, there ain't nobody else here. If I put a fucking bullet in your brain, and that fucking whore of yours, no one would be here to witness it, is that right? Huh? Huh? Okay, okay, okay, I'll tell you. There's somebody in the bathroom. You're fucking lying to me again. My partner just was in there. He didn't look down the shower curtain. Shit! - You hit? - No. Charlie Sanders, come on out, man. I know who you are, big fan of yours. I want to meet you. Come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on out, no one will get hurt. All right, that's right. Nice and easy man. Come on, why don't you put the girl down? I just want to talk to you. You want to talk with two cops? That's way too many for talking, honey. Look, I just want to walk out of here. I don't want to kill her. I don't want to kill her! I don't want you to kill her, either, man. That'd be bad. Killing would be really, really bad, man. Come on, I don't want to kill her, don't make me kill her. I don't want you to kill her, either, man. Come on, man, put her down. Don't make me kill her, I don't want to kill the bitch! Come on, put the fucking gun down! No, back up! All right, fucking do it already, man, I'm sick of you! Home run, home run, Charlie, Charlie. Come on, fucking do something, Hey, batter, batter, batter, batter, batter. Come on, fucker! Come on Charlie! Shut up! Shut up! Come on, batter, that's right, baby. Come on, come on, man. You shoot her, I'll shoot you, it'll be fun! Come on, fucking do something! Fucker! No! Baby, come here. Come here, I've got you sweetheart. Come here. Oh, yeah, that's okay, baby. I got you. You okay? Are you okay, baby? Oh, Jesus. She's high as a kite. Oh, shit. Here, take her. Hey, man, take the kid. Chris! Get her hand. It's okay. Shut up, you stupid bitch! That's your daughter isn't it, is that your daughter? You sold your own fucking daughter to a pimp? What is the matter with you? What kind of fucking mother are you? She's no longer your daughter, now she's the daughter of the state of California! Don't touch her, you bitch! Don't touch her, I'll kill you, bitch! I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners. Pray for us sinners. Pray for us sinners. Pray for us sinners. Pray for us sinners. Yeah? Charlie Sanders. You didn't have to shoot him. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. He was ready to talk. Look, I don't need to justify myself to you. Fuck that, Hugs! You killed the man. Can we at least talk about that? Yeah, he was ready to talk. Or he was ready to blow that kid's brains out. Maybe you could tell the difference, but I sure as hell couldn't. I did have a gut feeling, though, and I went with it. Am I going to lose any sleep over it? No, and neither should you, knowing that scum's off the street. Any other questions? Chuck Sanders. Congratulations on a job well done. Best switch hitter in the league. What are you going to say at the Q and A? About what, sir? The shooting. That's what we're going to ask you about. See, every time one of you guys shoots somebody, we gotta ask some questions. You know, what happened, stuff like that. You know what happened. Officer Hugosian shot the suspect. Was it a justifiable shooting, in your opinion? In my opinion, yes it was, sir. She didn't shoot the suspect in the left eye, if that's what you're asking. Maybe she missed. Speaking of left eyed shootings, you're joining us for the audition? I'm holding auditions for the chorus line. Guess what? I think our friend Nora has a good chance of getting the lead. See, the winking corpse shooter got a little careless. Left an eyewitness at the scene, no pun intended. Granted, he's a wino, he's a little fucked up, out of his mind, but we gotta check it out, right? Anyway, our guy swears on his mother's grave the shooter was a cop. Did he, did he say that the shooter was a woman? Man, woman, a cop. Uniforms aren't bathing suits. Everybody looks the same sex. Or lack thereof. No, not them. You sure? Yup. This is absurd. My guys are my guys, and I know my guys. We're ready for the next batch. Yup, that's it. That's who I saw. You going to tell us, or is it a secret? Him. Second from right. Michael Clements? Him, you're sure? Yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure it was him. Sure? Sure how? Huh? It was dark, wasn't it? Wasn't it? How sure are you? I'm pretty sure. I mean, it was dark, yeah. When the guy got out of the black and white, you know, the light came on, you know, the little light? And for a second there, yeah, it was him. I think. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, its me, Ernie. Listen, I'm at Mike's. I really need you to come over here. Right now. Hey, thanks for coming by, man. All right, listen. It's Mike. He's over here in the bedroom, he's been drinking. He called me up to bring him over some more. All right, maybe I shouldn't have done that. Chris, he's got a gun. I thought maybe you could come over here and talk to him a little bit? You know, tell him some of that fucking Catholic school shit or something, I don't know. Just talk to him. All right, Chris, I'm starting to get a little fucking scared here. Was the weapon a PPK? No. Who the fuck are you? Mike, Mike, it's me, Chris O'Brien. Come here. You see them? They're watching me, man. Everywhere I go, they're fucking watching me. Mike, it's just a peeping Tom. Nobody's watching you. Okay, there's a party upstairs, he's much more interested in that. They take my badge, they take my gun, and now they're trying to fucking fry me. Come on, Mike, it's temporary. Listen, if you're innocent, you didn't do it, you know there's nothing they can do, right? You're innocent. You just don't get it. You don't get it. And what's for dessert? Cream with fucking sugar. Mike, come on, give me the gun. This gun? This gun? You can't have this gun. 'Cause that's my gun. I bought this gun with my hard-earned money. My hard-fucking-earned money! Fifty bucks says I can hit him in the left eye from here. Mike, come on. Come on, Mike, that's an easy 50 for me. Come on. Look at you, your hands are shaking. You shouldn't drink so much, man. You're a good cop. Mike... One hundred bucks says I don't miss my head from here. Mike, you don't want to do that, Mike. Mike... Mike, that's a big fucking sin, you don't wanna do that. Mike, that's a big fucking sin. Mike! I didn't kill nobody. -I believe you. -Don't! Didn't they teach you that at the academy? Everybody is guilty until proven not. Hey, Sarge? Yeah, what do you want? I want to talk to you about Michael Clements, sir. I saw him last night, and I don't think he did it. He's really hurting now. He didn't do it. Listen, O'Brien, I got a headache this big, and it's got crap written all over it. So why don't you go do something you're actually being paid for? Thanks, Chris, but we already know Clements didn't do it. He's got an alibi. Solid gold. Officer Hugosian, she claims she was with Clements the night Barry Glover got capped. Engaging in all kinds of sexual intercourse. She does? That's what she claims. Claims my ass, she was there, all right. Sex is legal in this country. Couple more Democrats in the house, they'll make it compulsory. You know, it upsets me deeply, Sergeant, that my job interferes with your well-run operation. You know, I just stick to the facts. Facts? What facts? Tire prints in Griffith Park? Call Ripley, he's not going to believe you. Some wino, wants to be famous, starts squawking about a shooter-cop. For all these facts, I could fertilize the fucking Grand Canyon. What are you grinning about? Funny? You know what's funny? You, sitting here, wasting face space with that grin. Why don't you go make like OJ, and try and find the real killer, okay? You're late, I'm almost done here. So, Clements, you're backing him? Yep. You really went to his place that night? Me and him. We're kind of "us." We rode together, you know? One thing led to another. You know how that goes. Then it started to interfere with the job, so I asked for a switch. And I got you. You're the lucky winner. You're on. Last night, I saw him, and he was really desperate. I mean, if he knew he had an alibi... Why didn't he say something right away? Our affair was strictly hush-hush. He wasn't going to say anything. He was waiting for me to come forward. I don't believe you. So? You don't believe in evolution, either. I don't believe you were with your lover that night, because you were in pain. That thing you had, you were in pain. You turning into a good cop on me, Chris? Maybe you're just jealous. Hey, spot me. You're right. I didn't go over there for sex. I went there to tell him it was over. You know why I did that? Jesus Christ, you trying to kill me? Know why I ended it? Spot me! You see how much I trust you? You drop this thing, and I'm in a wheelchair for the rest my life, or dead, if I'm lucky. But you're not going to drop it, are you? You see, because I trust you. Do you trust me? I, I can't. Hey! I like you. I like the way you look at me when you think I'm not looking. And how you held me. I like the way you held me. You're crazy. You following me? Oh, I was... I just uh... -I wanted to see you. -What for? I don't know, I thought, uh... I was just lonely, I thought maybe you were, too. You lie like a dog. A big, old, hairy nasty dog. You know, if you can't trust your partner, who can you trust? I'm not a nice girl, you know. Not your "take her home to mother" kind. Especially not your mother. Don't care. You don't, huh? What, you want me to be bad? Huh? You like bad? How bad? How bad do you want me to be? How bad do you want me to be bad, huh? You know Hertzel thinks you're the shooter? Hertzel can kiss my ass. What, you two are becoming pretty good friends, aren't you? Let me tell you something about Hertzel. Hertzel looks at the world as if it were a chess set. All black and white and square. Well, I guess I'm a lot like that. I know. But you're just a boy. You don't know any better. So where are you going at two in the morning? I was lonely, and I like to walk. Which one is illegal? Hey, wait a minute. I want to talk to you. First you gotta decide whether you want to book me, or fuck me. Well, you can't possibly be here to book me. Hey. What? It's me, or her. Come on, you can go to confession later. You won't forget me now, your first girl. That bad? I'm just teasing. Good, because you're not my first. Really? Good. I won't want the responsibility. Who was your first? He was an older man. He was very religious, just like you. Didn't take sex lightly. Afterwards, he'd always go to confession. That always cracked me up. He called me his little princess. I called him dad. I'm sorry. Don't be. He's in hell now, and I'm here with you, so I guess there's such a thing as justice after all. Okay, what do you got on her? - Nothing. - Nothing? Running around in L.A. in the middle of the night for nothing? For what, for exercise? Didn't I tell you not to mess around with her? Didn't I? Spying on me, is that in your job description? Yes, it is. I describe my job description, me. Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to go home now. Why are you protecting her? You really think she'll sweat for you? You want her to be guilty. Why, why do you want her to be guilty? You fuck her? Hey. I asked you a question, Officer. Did you fuck her? Did you? I love you. I love you. So, how does it work, anyway? What? Confession. You just go in, kneel down, get some stuff off your chest, give it to this guy, he puts it in a vault. and throws away the key? Yeah, sort of. That's convenient. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. it's been forever since my last confession. So, what happened to your first? I lied. You're it. I mean, I've had other girlfriends, but, uh... Never gone all the way. Not like with you. This is good, right? This is perfectly good and normal, right? What was that? What? That's a gun. Maybe I'm just happy to see you. That's a PPK, isn't it? Yes, it is a PPK. Personal protection. Never use, never abuse. Had it six or seven years. You want to take it to Hertzel? Here, take it. Check it out, that's what you're here for, right? No, it's not. Oh, shit, better wipe off the prints from the murder weapon. I'm sorry. Well, there you go apologizing again. I should go, I should go. I guess you should. Hey, know what I've been thinking a lot about lately? Carmela. Selling her daughter to a pimp. How does someone do that? How do you sell someone you love? What would you do? I'm not a cop. You know, I used to have this picture in my mind, what the bad guy looked like. It didn't look like Nora. I just, I just want to prove if she's innocent or if she's guilty. I just-- I need to know. What are you going to do? I don't know. I don't know what to do. Everything's screwed up, I don't know how to trust, I don't know who to talk to. Why, why don't you tell me what I should do? Can't you absolve me, give me a penance? Why don't you tell me what chapter to read? Come on, talk to me. Tell me something. Jesus. Jesus. She's going to kill Carmela. I don't know. Why, what's her motive? Justice. She catches them, they get back out, they're back in the sea. I mean, Barry Glover, he threatened her. So did Pablo. Nora as Dirty Harry? That's what Hertzel thinks. Yeah. What do you think? You sleeping with her? Just asking. Yeah, right. Nobody here is just anything. I'll take that as a yes. The point is, you can't really be trusted on this one. Unless, unless you bring me the gun. And then we'll check it, we'll finish this thing once and for all. You're talking illegal search. I'm not. It's not a search. What if you find it by accident? Accidents happen, don't they? Is that in the law enforcement handbook? Because I think I missed that chapter. Oh, don't give me that. You came to me with all this stuff. I sit here with you, I'm a cop. Nothing else. What are you? I don't know, jury's still out on that one. Hey. Yeah, it's me. Listen, uh, I was wondering, since the other night didn't work out, I was thinking maybe we could have dinner tonight. Yeah, at my place. Well, I was going to cook. Yeah, I mean, uh, you know if that's not cool, you taste the food, you can tell me, we can order out. Yeah. Um, no I'm at my place, it's just the T.V. Okay, so I'll see you at eight? Okay, great. All right, bye. Do not fuck with me. Son of a bitch. "Always remember it's not your fault. You must always remember that." Hey, there you are. I left you a note. Yeah, I got it. Went to get some wine. Be back in a few. That's very clever of you. To leave me a note. Is something wrong? You seem kind of... No, I uh, I've never done this before, so... I know. Ah, don't worry about it. The more you do it, the easier it gets. Yeah? Did you get it? No. You didn't find it? No, I didn't. Listen, I'm trying to get some sleep, okay? Is she there? She is, isn't she? No. Good night. Who was that? Nobody. My mother. Night owl, isn't she? Yeah. I'm so tired. Get some sleep. "Always remember it's not your fault. You must always remember that. Don't cry for me, okay? I hate it when you cry, Sis. And never blame yourself. You have to promise me that. Blame the big, bad son of a bitch world. Love always, Armen." Nora has a brother. Used to. I dug up some old papers on microfiche, and Armen killed himself 18 years ago. "Don't blame yourself." Why would she blame herself? I guess Nora's not going to tell us. Armen's record might. He had a nice little juvie sleeve. So it's sealed. Maybe we could try to unseal it. Yeah, we could. Could take a while, too. Let's try something else first. Yeah, sure, I remember every case I ever worked on. Remind me of the facts, I'll remember it. May I? Go ahead, it's all yours. This pension really sucks, you know? You turn around once or twice, and where is it? It's gone. Look at you guys. The two of you, you're both still in the womb. What is that in your hair, placenta? Come on, guys. Screw this job, change careers. Be smart. The Hugosian case? Oh, yeah, I remember. A good case it was. And that kid. What was he, Armenian or something? Armen. Yeah, Armen, that's it. Real bright kid. Steals a gun from a neighbor, shoots his father. Hello, gorgeous, I got one big one here. He shoots his father, and then what? Then nothing. He shoots him dead, that's for sure. And he writes some little "forgive my sorry ass" note, and offs himself. Tragic, isn't it? Except, who gives a shit, right? Probably a loon, anyway. Hey, baby, how about you? Want a lap dance? Amen! In the note, did he say why he killed his father? Yeah. And a good why it was, too. His old man was banging his sister. And that sister, she was something else, let me tell you. If she didn't give you a high hard one, there was something wrong with you. Where, where did he shoot him? In the bedroom, I think. No, where on the body? Right in the eye. Dead right in the left eye. Bullseye. And he didn't miss an inch of it. Is it true, Hugs? Is it true? Fuck true! Yeah, I've got a skeleton in my closet that's kept me up nights for 18 years. My brother killed my father to save me, then killed himself. What, does that make me a killer, too? Hugs, I'm on your side. Yeah, well, just stay on your own side. They were all your collars, shot in the eye. What am I supposed to think? You're supposed to think that maybe, maybe someone who knows about my brother, is setting me up. Who, who knows about it? Have you told anyone? Yes, I did. I told him. Bullshit. I told you that night in New York. She's insane. Yeah, I was. I must have been out of my mind to open up to you. What, are you setting me up? Why? What, because I dumped you when you proposed to me? Is that why you followed me out here to L.A.? Huh? Do you have an alibi for the nights of the shootings? Now that you bring it up, what's your alibi? I've got one. Michael Clements. Hertzel, do you own a PPK? You know, Sergeant, I don't have to respond to that, but I will give you the courtesy. No, I do not. Do you, Hugs? Nope. That's bullshit. I saw it. In your wet dreams! What, is that what you were doing at my house the other night? Looking for a gun that doesn't exist? What was that? Officer O'Brien conducted an illegal search of my house. Is that true? Sergeant, we had reason to believe we were on the right track. God, this is a joke. We? You authorized it? No. We're just trying to get to the bottom of this. Oh, yeah. I'm sure you're really good at doing that, Cinderella, getting to the bottom of things. Tell me, I'm just curious, who do you have to fuck to make detective, anyway? You're out of touch, Hugs. We've got quotas now. Always looking for a few good women. Oh, is that what you're doing here? Looking for a good woman? Well, shit, that explains a lot of stuff. How do you want me, Lynn, huh? I know you do, you want a little one on one action, you think that'd be fun? Sorry, you're not my type. Do you feel rejected? I don't know, maybe you're setting me up. -Stop it. -What? Oh, I, I, I'm sorry, Sarge, is this getting you hot? All this girl talk? Don't worry, I'm into guys. I mean, you know what I'm talking about. I know you're married, but the way you look at me, I mean, what, I'm sorry, is there anyone in this room who doesn't want to fuck me? That's enough. Yeah, I know, that is enough. Everyone, if you look hard enough, dig deep enough, everyone has a motive. Jesus Christ. How fucked up is this? Way beyond. I'm taking this upstairs. And we're going to start un-fucking it right now, ladies and gents. Dombrowsky, you can start by saying goodbye to this case. Hertzel, Hugosian, don't leave the proverbial town, okay? We'll need you for more questioning. You won't even suspend her? No, I won't. I'm not going to take her badge until somebody gives me something concrete to hang it on. Fuck. Now, you, O'Brien. You, I can suspend. We don't do illegal searches here. You are suspended as of immediately. She never told me about her brother. Yeah, that's what I thought. You know they're going to go after you anyway? Mm-hmm. Til they come up empty and drop it. But that isn't the point. She's created a reasonable doubt. So what's next? I hate this damn machine. It doesn't know when to give up. You know what it does when the shit really starts to hit the fan? It starts to make stupid moves, the craziest moves you've ever seen. It's still the same machine, smart as before. It just gets scared, scared to death. Should have walked away. When it was over, I should have just walked away. Crack cocaine. You know it's going to kill you, but you come back for more. Well, my career's in the toilet. I'm out of cigarettes. And Nora goes scot-free. Just like that? Over and out? Well, not for you. See, I've noticed, I've noticed something in Nora's eyes I've never seen before. And believe me, I've looked. Nora Hugosian is in love. With you. She is in love with you, Chris. And, you know what? You betrayed her. I'd watch my back if I were you. Yeah? Hey. Hey, listen, it's me. Hey, get this, you are going to love it. Look, I'm real tired. Yeah, well, this going to keep you up. All right, check it out. So, I got over to Mike's house, right, because we're supposed to go out and try to get some. And I get here, and the door's open, right? So the door's open, so I go in, okay? All of a sudden, I hear these voices coming from Mike's room. And I'm thinking, "Hey, maybe Mike's got a spare chick in the bedroom for me." You know, 'cause Mike's into that kind of shit, you know? Check it. One of the voices is Mike's all right. Do you wanna guess who the other one is? No. The other one is Hugs. Still tired? Anyway, so they are getting real fucking loud, I mean, they're yelling at each other at the top of their lungs. Want to guess what their fight is about? Ernie, where are you calling from? From here, from Mike's house. I had to tell somebody about this. She still there? Yeah, I guess. Ernie, listen to me. Get out now. Get the fuck out! Hello, hello? Son of a bitch! Hey, there. Drink? Homicide guys are on their way. You just tell them what happened, and everything's going to be fine. Tell them what? I don't know shit. I was at a bar, drinking. I don't know shit. Bullshit, Mike. Come on, you were here. You and Nora had a fight. Fight? There was no fight. I haven't seen her in days, to the best of my fucking knowledge. You're fucking lying to me, Mike. You know, you know what's she been doing! You know, you saw her do it, didn't you? When you were riding around together, that's why she asked for a switch. That night she said she was with you, she wasn't with you. You were her alibi, not the other way around. I don't know what you're talking about. Ernie is fucking dead. He's fucking dead! I saw him down there, drinking. You don't tell them what happened, and they are going to nail you. You're building your own fucking chair. Why? What does she got on you? Just tell me this. You let her get away with this, you let her leave. How you going to live with yourself? Live with myself? I don't live with myself, man. I haven't lived in a long fucking time. I'm gonna go call Peggy, and Sarah. We'll have ourselves a little party. A party? I want to help you, man. But I can't. I just can't. You just did. Yeah? Police, open up. - Yeah? - How you doing, sir? You like to watch, huh? Come on, you dirty motherfucker! I know you like to look across that fucking street, so I want you to tell me what you saw. I've seen lots of women there. I know you've seen women. I'm talking about a fucking hour ago. What did you see an hour ago? Can you do that? -I saw a woman there. -What does she look like? She had... You gotta fucking remember! Wake up, and tell me what she fucking looked like! Wait a minute. Did she look like that? Yeah, that's, that's her. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Girl like that, you don't forget. The APB is out and running. Airports, bus stations, trains. If it moves, we check it. You did a good job, O'Brien. We'll get her. When Clements sleeps it off, he'll fill in the blanks, and it's just leg and facts work. We'll get her. You're a lucky guy, Chris. You're going to live forever. Looks like Hugs had a little parting gift for you, huh? You think she knows I'm alive? Yeah, she knows. You made the evening news. Give me your gun. Chris, she can't get to you here. You know her. Leave me your gun. You know it's against regulations. Okay. Go ahead and bring her in. Right there. Let's go. Nice and easy. Here we go. Here we go, easy. Feeling okay, sweetheart? Not too good, huh? I'm going to make it all better now. What's going on? You called 911, ma'am, from your motel room. Oh, yeah, my motel room. I must have passed out. I do that sometimes. I'm okay now. Hospital rules, ma'am. The doctor will be with you in just a few minutes. Sleep tight. Excuse me, do you know what room Chris O'Brien's in? I'm sorry, ma'am, visiting hours are from nine 'til... He's in room 319, it's down this way. -Thank you. -Poor guy. He's so cute. Yeah, we like him. Hi. They're all looking for me. Where am I supposed to go? What am I going to do? I came here to end it. You mean to turn yourself in? Why'd you have to be such a cop? Always digging, digging, digging. I've only loved two people in my life. My brother, and maybe you. I don't know why I loved you, I guess maybe you reminded me of him. This is really hard. It's hard to kill someone you love. But you didn't really leave me much choice. Shit. Okay, I'm ready. Did you hear that? Okay, this is it. God damn you, Chris. I loved you. -Don't do it. -I have to. - Don't do it. - I have to. Mike? Mike? My name is not Mike. My name's Armen. Look, look what he did to you. I'm sorry. It's okay. You've got to walk away, Armen. This has got to stop right now. Walk away? I can't. You're right here, I have to be here, too. I love you. But I can't let you do this anymore. Okay, baby? You just walk away and get out of here. Okay? I can't. Not until he pays for what's he done. 50 bucks, Chris. 50 bucks say I shoot you in the left eye from here. I'm sorry. He just wanted to protect me. The kid, Armen. He killed himself, everybody knew that. No, they did not. Armen kills his father, he runs. They find the suicide note, talk to a couple of junkies who saw him jump off the bridge. That's it. Case closed. Body or no body, Armen is free. I'll bet even Nora didn't know he was alive, 'til he found her in New York a couple of years later. As Michael Clements. Why didn't she come to me? We were good friends. She couldn't. She couldn't turn her brother in. And in his mind, he was just protecting her. She came to the hospital to kill him. And save you. She knew Clements was going to finish me off, so... she saved my life. Now I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do with it. Keep fighting crime, with all you've got, 'til there's nothing left to fight. Sure, Sarge. Get in. Equal rights my foot. I don't care how many women they accept, the academy is still a boy's club. And I'm doing really good there, right, I'm doing better than most guys. And still, they look at me like "Forget it, baby. "You're never going to make a good cop." I hear your last partner was a woman. Was she any good? Was she? She was the best. Yeah, that's what I hear. Where we going, anyway? 229 Burbank. That's my place. I know. I know. I know.
