We still don't know. Metal? Most archaeological finds from this period are stone, but not this one. My father believes it's melted meteorite. Ten years of research and you're still not sure. These things take time. And no more money means no more research. Not here, at least. Well, I'm grateful for the mystery. Otherwise, our chance encounter at the market may have never come to pass. That would have been tragic. I... I'm awfully excited to meet your father. He's a fine and fascinating fellow. You're cute when you're nervous. PAUL: It's true, young man. I am fascinating. Father, there you are. You said that a Captain James Beal would be stopping by to say hello, and... see our little sphinx here. Yes, sir. Pleased to meet you, sir. Pleasure is mine. Have you any money on you? To help with the cause. [HESITATES] Well, I didn't... I'm pulling your leg. [ALL LAUGH] Will you be joining us for supper? I'll teach you how to write your name in ancient hieroglyphs. Sounds delightful. Excellent. My apologies for arriving so late, I was... Well, I was waylaid by a telegram. It seems our old friend Deitrich, my... partner in all this madness, won't be returning. What? He was in Berlin dredging up backers for our work. CATHERINE: What was his message? PAUL: It is so odd. Just a curt goodbye and nothing more. It's not how I imagined he would leave us. PAUL: Maybe this really Is over. Well, I do hope you're hungry. CATHERINE: He's actually a terrible cook, so beware. All right. Thank you. You think so? CATHERINE: Yeah. He's very nice. Stop it. Yes, he is. Though, it's still all very new. And your eyes are still all lit up. Catherine, I hope you realize you don't have to leave Egypt on my account. I'm not. Owens, at the museum was so impressed with my cataloging of our Giza artifacts that he offered me a position. [CLEARS THROAT] I thought you'd be proud of me. No, Catherine. I am, but... our work, this is your legacy as well. You just said it was over. Where is the money coming from this time? Now, that's none of your concern, is it? It's none of my concern? I spent my entire childhood living your work. And now you're being stubborn. You're being ridiculous and condescending! You never take even a moment to slow down and think before you act. You are just like your mother. Catherine! [EXCLAIMS ANGRILY] What're you doing, Catherine? [BREATHES HEAVILY] [LOUD THUD] [GASPS] [ENGINE IDLING] WILHELM: It is here. I don't believe this. It's really here. It's really, truly here. Look, exactly like the hieroglyph. I'm so proud of you. Come. Yeah. Behold, the gateway to history... PAUL: Hello? Excuse me? ...is finally... Please, stop. Stop. Please, stop. PAUL: May I help you? My most sincere apologies. You must be Professor Paul Langford. I am, and... My name is Dr. Wilhelm Brucke. Chief occultist to the Fuhrer. I feared we might never find you. Although, it is to be expected, since the world has forgotten you exist. I beg your pardon? Do you have any idea what you have uncovered here? We have some theories, yes. I come with more than theory. Looking through the prism of several dead languages... Have you ever seen this before? Where did you find this? I procured it from a felonious little spice dealer in Thailand two years ago. I don't understand. Surely, you are familiar with the recent theory of Einstein-Rosen bridges. PAUL: I still don't understand. WILHELM: Too busy studying the ancient Egyptians? PAUL: Yes. WILHELM: Forest for the trees, Professor. WILHELM: When I laid eyes upon this parchment, I knew I had found something truly special, which holds meaning beyond our world, of what we can only imagine, for now. Have you never wanted to take a step back, so you could look at it? Never imagined that this might be, say, a doorway? A doorway? [GUN COCKS] Evening, Fraulein. Why ever are you sneaking around so late at night? I was hoping to brush up on my German. WILHELM: You must be Catherine. PAUL: Wait, no. Wait, wait, wait. Stop. Hands, hands! CATHERINE: I'm okay. Wonderful of you to join us. What is this? Where is Deitrich? Poor Deitrich. Upon alerting me to your whereabouts, I'm afraid he was met with a disastrous difference of opinion in Berlin. Let go of me. Heinrich, there's no need for this weapon. Let's be civilized here. Stefan, Gunter, rope. Let go of me! Catherine, do as they say, please. Go finish preparations. Civilized? Poor fool... All this time, completely oblivious to its true purpose, its true power. One only I comprehend. These symbols, in this order. Who are you? I'm the answer you have been looking for. And what do you plan to do with us? Patience, Professor. You will soon know. First, I will open our little doorway here. [ENGINE REVVING] Soon, all shall bear witness... Wait. No, wait. The angle is better from over here. Okay, it's your best side. This side? Are you sure? And everyone has one side better than the other. Yup. You too? Wait, wait, turn. It's the other side. Both sides are perfectly the same. Okay, come. Come, come. Commence with the final sequencing. [ENGINE STARTS] Please. Please, be careful. Quiet. No interrupting. WILHELM: Soon, all shall bear witness to the great power, like no one has ever seen before. Waiting for someone like me to awaken it from its eons of slumber. Beautiful! Oh, my God. Yes. Quite right, Fraulein. Gods, I suspect. With such technology, just think of the power they must wield. Imagine what they could have accomplished by now. Imagine what I will be able to bring back. For Hitler and for Germany. Heil Hitler! This is madness. No, this is genius. This is the future. This is a gateway to another world. Well, on the other side... The other side? You can't be serious. There's no telling where this thing might take you. Did Columbus know? Magellan? This energy could kill us all. WILHELM: Perhaps, yes. We should test it. Stefan. Are you ready to be a good servant to your Fuhrer? You see? Perfectly safe. Go get me the professor. No. No. No, no. No, no, no. No, stop. Let go of me! Quiet! Catherine, stop. Stop. Please. Wait! Wait. I'll do what you ask. If you give me your word as a man... that you will not harm her. I give you my word for that. Your word means nothing to me! Father! WILHELM: Fear not. He's perfectly safe. I will be right behind him. Look at you. Coming so undone. I feel for you. Such energy, such potential. And there you are, watching me unlock the great mystery you and your father couldn't. [SPITS] Wilhelm. So sad. So pathetic. There, now. You want to look nice on your father's big day. Auf wiedersehen. Next time, I'll make you really bleed. There's nowhere on this Earth you can hide from me. Broaden your horizons, my dear. Earth is no place to find a God. My notes. If we fail to come back on schedule. WILHELM: Don't lose it. This book holds the key to open the gate. Dr. Brucke, what should I do with her? Make sure she is safe at the embassy. You should smile, Catherine Langford. After all, you're finally in the presence of true discovery. Must be a good change. You're a dead man. I would watch what you say, lest you find yourself standing behind your father's grave. Remember, he's the only thing you have left. If he's all I have left, then I'll stop at nothing to find him. [ENGINE STOPS] I don't suppose there's any way I can convince you to untie me? Well... No. No. Pig. [ENGINE WHIRS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Got it. [ENGINE STARTS] Can I tell you something personal, Wasif? I never thought waiting would be a problem. Only now, she doesn't want to wait. I do not know, my friend. Love is not for me. You just haven't met the right girl yet, Wasif. If only others tired of saying that as fast as one tires of hearing it. Check or fold? Not so fast. All I'm saying is, love can happen when you least expect it. Top notch security, fellas. Relax, I'm American. Hello, James. Got a knife? [BREATHES HEAVILY] [SIGHS] I pray that wasall captured. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! The camera, please wait. EVA: Good. Look around. So beautiful. Yes. Put your other hand. Yeah! EVA: And walk that way. Stefan. WILHELM: Eva. A message for our Fuhrer. Only that I was right. [LOUD FLASH] Exactly like the one we have in Berlin. This must be how they open it without all that electrical nonsense. The completed puzzle. Wunderbar. All this time, I was so convinced this was... just another Rosetta Stone. I can't believe it. Well, let's see who's home. Who's home? Professor! Open your eyes, Professor. Does this temple look abandoned? These curtains, do you suppose they are naturally occurring? Unlike you, I am not afraid. Whatever God rules this place, I intend to meet him. Let's go. JAMES: Cut the engine, Cat. They'll hear us. CATHERINE: You can hear this thing from a mile away. Let it get a little closer. JAMES: Stay sharp, Wasif. Yes. Sharp. I thought there were going to be Nazis. [GUN COCKS] Get on the ground. She's not quite what I expected. Yeah, she's great. Are those mine? PAUL: Might I possibly be untied now? No. Lovely. This is my discovery. WILHELM: Say something. [STAMMERING] I beg your pardon? Introduce us in ancient Egyptian. [CHILD WAILS] I don't have time for this. Gunter, seize her. Seize her, now. Catch her. The language of the pharaohs hasn't been spoken for 3,000 years. I was right. We have traveled into the past. No. I was right. Beings like her, they created the past. Thanks for the help, boys. JAMES: Care to explain what's going on? You said there was a whole group of Nazis. There were, and they left. With your father. Exactly. I don't get it. They went through that. Through that? Then, where did they go? Can you help me, please? JAMES: Catherine! Are you feeling all right? I feel fine. I know this sounds crazy, and if this doesn't work, then I will freely admit that I'm crazy. But it will work. So, please, help me. What can I do? Okay, hook those cables up. There are seven symbols. We need to arrange them in correct sequence by sliding that inner ring. That'll open this thing. It looks open to me. CATHERINE: James! You said you would help me. Make him help me. Wasif, please! Humor her. Don't you dare humor me, okay? Please, help me. All right. Okay, James, the one by your left foot, that one there. You need to move that one that looks kinda like a "Y," clockwise. CATHERINE: Okay, good. Now what? We need more power. Where do we get that? The car engine. They were revving it before. JAMES: Oh, my God, it's moving. It's supposed to do that. Think I get it. We're looking for... I don't know how to describe it. Just keep moving it around. James, nine o'clock. Wasif, the one by your right foot. CATHERINE: Move that clockwise. At seven o'clock. You need to turn that counterclockwise. This one, it needs to go all around. James, just... Just keep spinning. Wasif, the one with the hourglass. This is actually a bit fun. Yes. CATHERINE: There's one more. A pyramid with a circle on top. Hear that? What is going on? Okay, move out of the way. That's it. What the bloody hell is that? Come on. Let's go. No. Thank you. CATHERINE: You said you would help me. Yes, but... Just look at it. I am looking at it. CATHERINE: James. I'm sorry. This is insanity. My father is on the other side. The Nazis really took your father through that? Yes. Why? I don't know. A weapon, some technology, and maybe... That Brucke? He was so smug. He gloated about bringing something back for Hitler and for Germany. What say you, Wasif? Goddamn power-hungry Nazis! There's your answer. Once more onto the breach. Yeah. Oh, come on! That was completely unnecessary. He wanted to go. Whatever happened to "ladies first"? Oh, please. And have you chickened out? I'm insulted. You have no idea what's waiting for us on the other side of this thing. My father is there! I know. So is Wasif. James. I'm here. That was unexpected. You never know. Might not get another chance. Why would we never get... [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING] [ELECTRONIC STATIC] Very unexpected. Tingly. [SCREAMING] [GASPS] Did you guys see those? What the bloody hell was that? I think they were stars. Do you know where we are? No idea. Look, this room is Egyptian. We just need to find our bearings. JAMES: Make a... What the... Why didn't it stay open? There is no connection. Nothing. This seems promising. Turn it back on, Cat. I'd rather not stay here too long. CATHERINE: Sure. All right. CATHERINE: Okay, one. At least getting back will be a little less exhausting. Yes. CATHERINE: Four. Five. Six. Seven, seven... [WHISPERING] Seven. There's no seventh symbol. What does that mean? The triangle with a dot over it. Yeah, it's... It's not here. Maybe this site has a different seventh symbol. So... So, all of them were in that Nazi journal, right? So, maybe, what we need now will also be in there. Yes. Maybe. The floor is wet. The floor is wet. Okay. Thank you. It's good to know. You're both being very helpful. CATHERINE: James, please, calm down. JAMES: Calm down? You could have landed us all on Mars. WASIF: Excuse me. I do not believe this is Mars. What do I know? I've never been. Wherever we are, let's treat it like hostile territory. Wasif. Join me on a sweep. Cat, stay put. You wish. Anything? No. Nothing yet. JAMES: Cat? Do you have any idea what kind of danger you've put us in? How was I supposed to know the sequence here would be different? It's not my journal. You didn't think to check before dragging us along... What? Any clue? Footprints and a dead Nazi. You? I found another bucket. Wasif, I swear... Come on, let's go. Cat, wait. Cat, wait. We've not secured this... Do you even know how to use that thing, other than clobbering people over the head with it? CATHERINE: I learned to shoot when I was 15 years old. Wow. Thank you. CATHERINE: When was the last time you fired it? Just don't be a hero. Only if I have to save you. Here we go. Wasif, you about, mate? Can't seem to find you. Just follow the sound of my voice. [WHISPERING] James. [SHUSHING] Over here. [GUNSHOTS] [BEAL GRUNTS] [CAT GASPS] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [CAT GRUNTS] [CAT GRUNTS] [WASIF GROWLS] [GUN CLICKS REPEATEDLY] [WASIF GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [ELECTRONIC WHOOSHING] Thank you, Wasif. Great shot. I got her. How? Hit her with this. Hold on to it. What was that? No women back home can fight like that. No man, either. JAMES: You... You had to be a hero. You needed saving. Okay, what was that? "Over here. Listen to the sound of my voice." It's called strategy. Strategy, is it? Is that, is that what you call it? Because, from what I saw, it was, like... He looks so human. Well, he's no threat at least. Figure out what he's on about, Cat. Hi. Hello. Just what are you trying to tell us? What? Do you have any idea what he's yammering about? I think he wants us to follow him. It almost sounds like the old... Wasif! Just give me a second. CATHERINE: What are you trying to say? [SPEAKS ANCIENT EGYPTIAN] Maybe the kid knows something. About the dead Nazi. About the woman we just fought. About what happened to your father. What about my father? Cat, your father's an old man. We really ought to consider the possi... Sorry. Here we go again. We need to go. Now. What the bloody hell is wrong with you? Wasif, help me. Thank us later. JAMES: So much like Egypt. Yes, very sandy. Hold on, hold on. Slow down, slow down. Let's start with the basics. I am Catherine. Catherine. Catherine. Catherine. Catherine. Catherine? Yeah. Catherine. Catherine. Catherine. Okay, who are you? Catherine. Catherine... No, no, no. I am Catherine. Catherine. He is Beal. Beal. Who are you? Is Beal? Is Beal. No. No, no. Catherine, Beal... Kasuf. Kasoof. Kasuf. Hasuf? Kasuf. Kasuf. It's like... Kasuf. Kasuf. Kasuf. Catherine, Beal. Wasif. Wasif. Wait! Kasuf! Kasuf! You're doing wonderfully. I do hope he takes us somewhere safe. We need to lay low. Lay low? Yes. What about my father? One thing at a time, Cat. Well, those footprints at the temple could be my father's. Those could've just as easily been left by that warrior. And I don't know how much your magic stick can do against an army of women like that. Well, maybe if we... Come on, come on. Catherine, Beal. Wasif! JAMES: Tents, how quaint. CATHERINE: Come on. CATHERINE: Father? WASIF: Where is everyone? CATHERINE: Hello? CATHERINE: Is there a Professor Langford here? We've lost our guide. I don't like this. Stay calm. CATHERINE: Okay, okay. Dear God, we are... Doomed. WILHELM: Nonsense. I brought us here safely, I shall return us home safely. Nobody even knows we are here. Stefan, calm. Heinrich knows! Yeah. Come, come. Eva, please, turn that camera off. But you have a good presence. Do I? Honestly, Eva, sometimes I question the Fuhrer's election of you. She's seized our weapons but left the rest of our equipment. And all that remains is useless. This is not useless. The thousand words contained within one image, can charm the hearts of empires. What does that even mean? You brought that for a reason. Yes. The long histories of my work. Time for a little demonstration. Stefan, come help me. WILHELM: Why so quiet, Professor? I was thinking about how I should thank you. For bringing you on the greatest adventure of your life? For keeping Catherine out of this Goddamn mess. From now on, I'm in charge. And here I thought you've been in charge this whole time. The kid was your idea. That is my finger you're bending. Sorry, thought it was Beal's. Is anybody here not hostile? Even we are fighting, I say no. You don't think I can get us out of this mess. Did I say that? Wasif, did I say... I have no opinion. I suggest we all remain calm, and let the solution present itself. Sit tight and wait? God, he's worse than you! Worse than me? You have no plan, nothing. So we escape, then what? They still have our guns. We take them back, obviously. Obviously. Look! Look! I'm next, I'm next! Not so loud! [LAUGHS EXCITEDLY] Don't tell me what to do. Lower your voice. We just have to keep calm, and... [YELLS] [GRUNTING] [STABBING SOUND] Help! Help! I told you to be quiet. [SPEAKING ANCIENT EGYPTIAN] Wasif, Wasif. Look at me. You're all right. What is happening? [SPEAKING ANCIENT EGYPTIAN] [CLICKING] [WHIRRING] What I have to show you. There are those like me who'd make for a strong friend and ally. [HITLERS VOICE IN GERMAN] [SPEAKING ANCIENT EGYPTIAN] [GUNSHOTS] [LAUGHS] This man, do they love and worship him? They do, as they will worship you. I sense she is pleased, tell her there is more So much more to see. I'm sorry about Wasif. I was only trying to... Trying to do what? Get us all killed? My father's out there, I need to do something. Nothing's stopping you, other than selfishness, armed guards, and having nothing that even resembles a plan. I need to save him, he's all I have. Is that what you think? Because that's simply not true. There are other people here for you, Cat. Do you understand? Dear God, just kiss already! How do you feel? Fine. Where are my clothes? Covered in blood. You were stabbed. I was stabbed? Why? We were trying to escape. It went badly. How do I not remember? You... You were in a rough state, a magic stick saved your life. Another magic stick? Yes, it would seem... Catherine's father unearthed a doorway to a land full of magic sticks. Cute. I know. Kasuf, you need to let us leave. He doesn't speak English. Okay. Well, at least I'm trying to communicate. Whatever this place is, he is saying it is his. You understand him? Yes, some of it. Sadly, I believe he just called us prisoners. Of course he understands, he's Egyptian! Yes, I am Egyptian. Why didn't you say so earlier? I thought it was fairly obvious. Not that you'renEgyptian, that you understand him! I only understand very little. A word here and there from Coptic. My grandmother spoke it. Also, you are difficult to interrupt. He was saying before out there, "Qeesa?" What does qeesa mean? Qeesa? Qeesa, it means danger. Kasuf. Qeesa. No, wait, we were just... Be quiet. Don't tell me to be quiet. No, he is saying be quiet. Something about tonight. Again, that means silent. Let me try. We are... Damn it! Why would you do that? No, enough. You, be... You think, we are qeesa? But you are wrong. If you do not let us leave, qeesa. How do we say father? Let me try. A bad, bad man. Bad man? Yes, yes. Took my... No, no. No. What exactly did you say? I believe they're apologizing. She said she likes your pin. What is she saying? I refuse to negotiate or translate for the rise of tyrants or Gods! Don't grasp at bravery now, Professor. It does not suit you. Slaves. She needs more slaves. Good. This? This is all she offers? Well, you sound disappointed. I feel unappreciated, yes! I offer thousands! WILHELM: No, tens of thousands! Hundreds of thousands of able-bodied men and women! And she thinks I will march back home and flaunt for the adoring masters, her precious gift of a rock? Naquadah. What was that? Naquadah. WILHELM: Yes, I heard. What does it mean? Well, Nagada was a city in ancient Egypt, also known as Nbwt. It was the center of their civilization. [SPEAKING ANCIENT EGYPTIAN] [SPEAKING ANCIENT EGYPTIAN] PAUL: Naquadah is life, death, everything in-between. No Naquadah. Yes, yes, this is very nice. Do I get this as well? A rock and my very own knife back. This staff has Naquadah. Naquadah guarantees swift death to every enemy. PAUL: Naquadah gives... ...eternal youth and beauty. Youth and beauty, forever? Imagine the power to grant eternal youth... or life. An everlasting Reich of my own! Don't look so worried, Professor. Perhaps I will grant you the gift of immortality, to serve me by my side, and watch how my empire grows. Kasuf. What I wouldn't give for a shepherd's pie. Any of this look familiar to you? You must be joking. Sorry. It does look a lot like Egypt. Not the food. How are you doing this? It's remarkably similar to ancient Egyptian. Once Wasif told me the Coptic vowel placement to listen for. Try this. No, it's good. My father, he's the real expert. Imagining what the language of the pharaohs would've sounded like has long been a passion of his. Looks like it paid off. Funny. I always thought it was a complete waste of time. That's why Brucke took him. What do you mean? He must've known my father would understand the language here. How could he have known that? Thank you. Okay. Wasif. Wasif? Wasif. CATHERINE: He knew enough to open the gate in the first place. It's not crazy to think he knew what he may have found here. There are glyphs in here that I've never seen before, which believe me, is rare. CATHERINE: What if I've never seen these before because they depict what happened here, on this world, not ours? CATHERINE: This is about more than saving my father. The power to heal, the weapon we were attacked with. If the Nazis got a hold of any of this... We need to stop Brucke. Okay. We need to go. Kasuf! Kasuf! Kasuf! Damn it, that's not what I meant. Okay, we need to go. Wait, no. Tomorrow. Tomorrow! We need to go now, we need to leave now. Cat. Cat. Play this smart, it's pitch black out there. All right. Let's settle. Tonight, we make friends and allies with these... fine people. ALL: Fine people! And tomorrow we beg them to join our cause and save our planet from unimaginable darkness and destruction. JAMES: Wow. Touch dramatic. Or we at least get our guns back. [CAMERA WHIRRING] EVA: And, action! Dearest members of the Vril Society, I bring good news. Proof that our theories were correct. Come, meet Aset, the God who rules this world. She has given me the power that we have been tirelessly looking for. The elusive Vril. In return, I will deliver multitudes of our undesirables... to toil at her command. A bold and prosperous partnership. And a triumph for the Fuhrer. Sieg Heil! Yes, yes, that as well. Perhaps now he will fullyappreciate. As will the rest of the world. Soon, every mortal shall bend the knee, and worship at the feet of the almighty... Aset! Beware, that is the man who likes to stab you. I found this. It's... dark and beautiful. Like you. It's a rock. Yeah, sure. Just... keep it? To replace your magic stick. [LAUGHS] [CLEARS THROAT] [WHISPERS] What are you two on about? I think he just offered us his tent for the evening. Are you nervous? What? No. Mm. Mm. Must mean dessert or cream. It means sweet. Very, very sweet. [BELL TOLLING] [INDISTINCT VOICES] It's okay. [LAUGHS] What? Cat? This tiny outpost could use a bit more manpower. Hold on. Catherine, you... Damn it! Cat! Your father. Father. No, no, no, not now. Not here. Let go of me. We still don't have our guns, there's nothing we can do. There's nothing we can do. [GRUNTS] Piss off. [LAUGHS] [SPEAKING ANCIENT EGYPTIAN] Away with you. Impressive display of subservience. Enough to rival my own loyal and obedient dog, Langford. But are they really willing to serve? Do they revere you enough to fight for you? To die for you? Her people are strong and well-trained, not like your stupid dead soldier. A test then, say it. A test, a friendly game, to highlight obedience and willingness to serve the cause. Stefan. Not this time. For Hitler. [GRUNTS] [YELLS IN PAIN] Stefan! I'm all right. She has allowed this outrage... because she earlier killed Gunter. Stefan! Stefan! Stefan! He was German. He was German! In service to the Fuhrer! He would've slowed us down! Go, go film! Eva, go film! We must assert our power, lest we lose it. Flex our might or be seen as weak! Did you get that last bit? Was it my good side? You have no good side. You're a monster. No, my friend, I am a God. Fear not, everyone, for I shall replace this loss with thousands upon thousands of slaves! The desert shall be filled forever! I can't remember the word for thousand. Langford! As long as Aset will have it. Langford. WILHELM: Eva. Come. CATHERINE: That son of a bitch. Wasif, get our guns now. Beal, we need to go. Hold on, hold on. No. That man, he deserves to die. Did you see what he just did? What do you think he'll do to my father? I understand, but we had better think this through. Yes. What did he say? I think they're asking us to help them destroy Brucke. Well, tell them... yes! They've returned to Aset's temple. So, we'll go in, in two teams. One creates a diversion, while the other rescues the professor. Then we stay here for the rest of our lives. Kasuf. It's just us. You will be filming this way? The scenery must not outshine me. How could it? What is she saying? I believe that she is excited to be in your film. As well as she should be. Don't tell her that. Tell her anything else. WILHELM: Ready? EVA: Yeah. Okay. WILHELM: Super. Wasif and I will return to camp, enlist more villagers to scout the temple and see if we can find a better point of entry. We could go with you. I've been in caves before, James, crossed deserts too. Just make it back safely. And I promise to stop being so nervous. If you say so. Hey... Yes, yes, yes. She knows. Do not be a hero, Catherine. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Catherine. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Catherine. Where are you? WILHELM: Langford. Come. Nagada? Nagada. CATHERINE: Kasuf. Never mind, Kasuf. We have to keep going. These stones they mine, allow Ra absolute power in the stars. And all who stand against him, are punished in white fire. What will happen when we get home? With me and Cat, I... No, the portal. It's far too dangerous for our uncertain world. If it were up to me, nobody would ever go through the blasted thing again. But it won't be up to you. And they won't keep quiet. Why does he keep taking your hand? Local custom. I believe? I don't know. Nobody's ever tried to take my hand. Right. We best be going. Come on. I've seen these before. Kasuf, I could kiss you. The completed sequence. Yeah, this is what I needed. What do you say, Kasuf? Will this take us home? Come on, let's go. Hold on. If Brucke didn't have these in his journal, then he'll need to come here before he leaves. I really hate to do this. [KICKS AND GRUNTS] [STONES BREAKING] Okay. Kasuf! [MOUTHING] Quiet down. [LOUD DRAGGING] [SHUSHING] He says that... Yeah, I got it. I've been thinking about what you said back in Cairo. Yes, you should give up playing dominoes? That love occurs when you least expect it. Now? You want to debate this now? No, not debate. Trust me, love has a way of sneaking up on you. CATHERINE: James! I got it. We can go home. You found it? The seventh symbol. Incredible. And I destroyed the only carving. That son of a bitch is never getting out of here. Well done. Unless Aset opens the gate for him. Damn it! We need to act now. Now? The plan. The diversion? We haven't... Okay. Let's go. Now, what shall be done with you? Your translation work has been excellent. Better than expected. Perhaps, therein lies the answer. Why not remain here, doing what you love? A bridge between our two worlds. Don't thank me. Tell her. That didn't go over so well. What did you tell her? Catherine's hairpin? Where did you get this? How is this here? Enough! What are you doing? He's mine! You should've studied languages. They certainly do come in handy. What did you tell her? Catherine is here, and I doubt she came alone, you Nazi son of a bitch. You turned your back on humanity. You're no God. You're not even a man. Well played, Professor. You've grown a nice little spine for yourself. Unfortunately, it ends now. You have to die. [HIGH-FREQUENCY PITCH] [BABY WAILS] We need to get out of here. Not without my father. Here, Brucke's journal, just in case. [CATHERINE GASPS] I tried to tell you. When you least expect it. Yes. Shoot me now, and you lose your voice here. It does not matter now. The deal is done. Get away from him. Fraulein! PAUL: Catherine! I told you there is nowhere you could hide from me. Now let him go. Or what? Or I pull the trigger. No, I don't believe you would, you see, I have the power... You can't harm a God. You need to realize who you are dealing with. A sad, pathetic, power-hungry Nazi. Nazis are nothing. Hitler is nothing. I have no longer any need for them, not when I have this. I told you I'd hunt you down. Catherine. He's not worth it. I've been so worried about you. Weakness. I'm surrounded by it. I am strong. I cannot die. Eva... Heil Hitler. JAMES: Wasif! Motawk! Go get more help. Go! Open the gate, James, the new sequence is in the journal. We're right behind you. Please... If not me... [DRAMATIC MUSIC] One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Seven. Come on. JAMES: Don't leave, Catherine! PAUL: This is your legacy as well. Catherine, I hope you realize you don't have to leave Egypt on my account. [ELECTRONIC STATIC] JAMES: Cat! The symbols, they worked! Oh, my God. You all right? What happened? It's open. We can go home. Serqet? We can go home. She's coming. Get down. [GUNSHOTS] Wasif! Motawk! James! We can go home. [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC] Well, I guess they were lucky. Whatever it was they were working on ended up killing that Nazi, and, apparently, wiped both of their memories. The doctor did seem convinced that the memory loss was genuine. I don't like it. Regardless, that cable that we intercepted from Berlin, suggests these Germans are keen to acquire whatever this thing is. This thing... is my life's work, thank you very much. You're certain you never encountered our missing British officer, Captain James Beal? It's possible, but I don't know. Don't know what, Father? They're asking about Captain Beal again. I don't remember ever meeting him. James Beal, has he contacted you? James? What about Wasif Alabu Khan. I don't know anyone by that name, but I do recall meeting James at the market. He was handsome. We made... I believe we made plans to meet again. He isn't the type to simply go AWOL. If you can remember anything even if it seems trivial, please contact the British Embassy when you arrive in the States. Of course. We'll leave you to your packing. My! That is a beautiful necklace. Thank you, I always thought it might bring me luck one day. Apparently the Germans have been funding them for years... CATHERINE: I do hope they find James. I found this... lying next to the ring. So unique. It's mine, I believe. For the life of me, I... I can't recall where I found it. Well, I can't believe it's all over. Something tells me it's only just beginning. Ready to go? Yeah. Yeah.
