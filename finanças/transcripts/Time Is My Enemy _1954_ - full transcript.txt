[dramatic music playing] [gunshots] [alarm ringing] [chatter] Police! Police! [chatter] [dramatic music playing] You'll be all right, old man. All right, get him away quick. And get these people out of the way! All right, thanks, Doug. I'll be along to the hospital as soon as I can. List of the witnesses. Not much good. What about the car? Light blue saloon, number unknown. Obviously stolen. They'll abandon it and go to earth until the press boys tell them it's safe to emerge again. [phone ringing] Brompton 1-4-2-4. No, sir, Mrs. Everton is not home yet. I thought you told me she would be back by 4:30. Oh. Sorry, Betty. I couldn't get my key. Is Mrs. Wescott here? Yes, she's in the drawing room. Thank you. Ah. Aunt Laura. I was so pleased to get your wire. What brings you to London after all these years? Your uncle's going to be hung. What? It's that watercolor of Rosedale Abbey, and I must say it's good. You mean he's going to be hung in the Royal Academy? That's right, dear. After trying for 20 years, he's as pleased as punch. I'm sure he is. And so am I. I like to come to London to see the shops. Not that we haven't got shops in Hensley, but you know it makes a change. Oh, I hope you don't mind my making myself at home like this. I should have been very annoyed if you hadn't. Where are you staying? The Imperial. It's quiet and comfortable, like your uncle and myself. How's John? Oh, flourishing. You'll see him quite soon. He'll be home early today. And Paul? Oh, he's fine. I had a letter from him this morning. He still seems to be quite happy at school. When Martin was killed, you said you'd never marry again. Remember? I remember. And I meant it. But I'm awfully glad John talked me into changing my mind. Well? He wouldn't touch it. What? Says it's too hot. Says he'll have nothing to do with murder. The chap isn't dead, is he? The paper said-- His condition's critical. And that's enough to scare Sheldon. See what you done with your damn fool shooting? I had to shoot. He was reaching for the alarm. And he got it too. Now we're stuck with a load of diamonds nobody wants. Well, Sheldon's not the only fence in London. What about Ernie Gordon? Try him yourself. I tell you I didn't like the way Sheldon acted. You'd have thought I had leprosy or something the way he shut me out of the shop. And I wasn't even in on the job. Oh, damn Sheldon and that fool of a jeweler. There must be someone who'll buy the stuff. You find him. I'm not. Well, what about Bob and Alf? Where are they? The two boys you took with you? - Um-hm. - They vanished. You're on your own now. You know, if that jeweler should die, things could get pretty interesting. Oh, there's John now. Hello, darling. Hello. Darling, look who's here. Well, the Yorkshire rose. This is wonderful. What brings you to the deep south? Henry is going to be hung. He's round at Burlington House now. I say, I am glad. We must go to the private view. BARBARA EVERTON: Yes, we must. Will you have some tea, John? No, thank you. I say, what a beauty! Well, I must try this out on the round pond. I did buy it for Paul, dear. Mm? Oh, you don't mind me looking at it, do you? No. That's why I brought it home, so that you could see it before I send it off. Send it off? You're not sending this to school? Oh, no, no, no, no. This must keep for the holidays. - Yes, I suppose so. Otherwise, he might break it before you had a chance to play with it. I shall go and change. If there's one thing I hate, it's putting on evening dress at tea time. Where are you going to tonight? Well, one of the penalties of being a publisher is you have to keep your successful authors happy. In this case it involves driving 50 miles into the heart of nowhere and getting there dead on 7:00. Don't run away. We'll have a drink before I go. Oh, Barbara, if Charles Wayne arrives, hang onto him till I come down. - Are you expecting him? He said he'd bring back that book he's been vetting for me. If it's business, I better be going. Nonsense! You must stay and meet Charles. He's a real, live detective inspector, you know. From Scotland Yard. You seem to be pretty sure it's them, sir. It had their handwriting all over it. Although I admit they've never actually shot anyone before. And as usual, they've all got beautiful alibis. Which this time we're going to break down. I'll see that gang behind bars if it's-- DOCTOR: All right, careful with it. --the last thing-- Inspector Wayne. That's me. Is this what you want? Oh, thanks. .45, nickel plated. Well, how's the patient? Not so good. Any prospect of his being able to make a statement, Doctor? Not the slightest. Not at present, anyway. Take that down to the Yard, Peter. Williams, you'll stay here in case he recovers enough to talk. I'll be down at the Yard shortly, but I've got a call to make on the way. If you need me, I'll be at the Evertons. Right. Ah, that'll be Charles. Here you are, Aunt Laura, the Everton special. One for you. - Thank you. Just in time for a drink, Charles. - Evening, Barbara. - Hello. Hello, John. Aunt Laura, this is Charles Wayne. Mrs. Wescott. - How do you do? How do you do? JOHN EVERTON: Scotch? - Thanks. Small one. I'm still working. Well, how's Paul, Barbara? Oh, he's fine, thanks. I'll show you his latest epistle. JOHN EVERTON: [chuckling] His spelling really is shocking. Look at the PS. Oh, I think it's jolly good. Look. CHARLES WAYNE: "If you can't"-- oh, I get it. "--a guided missile, I would like a-- a yacht." [laughter] I love the guided missile bit. Did you get one? No. He'll have to make do with a-- a "yatch." [laughter] Did you find time to read this? Yes. No technical errors. But I hope you don't publish it, John. Whyever not? The man's a bestseller. I know. It's one of the most ingenious plots he's ever given us. It may be ingenious, but it's also poisonous. What on earth do you mean? The sympathy's the wrong way round. It makes the murderer into a hero. Yes, but the man he's murdered is a scoundrel who's evaded the law. The hero becomes the instrument of true justice. The hero is a cold-blooded murderer who gets away with it. The censor would never pass a film like that, and quite rightly so. So why put it in a book that thousands of people are going to read? Young people included. Well, it's been done before. Oh, that's no excuse, John. Nowadays if you glorify murder, every thug in London sees himself as a hero. Do you mean you'd cheerfully arrest any murderer, however justified he may have been? Well, not cheerfully, perhaps. But I would. Even if he were a relative? Oh, yes, of course. It makes no difference. Supposing it was someone that you really loved. Well, in that case, I'd probably resign and drink myself silly. But no circumstances ever justify murder. Look, I've just come from the hospital, where they're fighting to save the life of a man who was shot this afternoon. He's got a wife and kids. Do you think they'd enjoy a book where the killer is treated as a hero? But is this the case you're talking about? Yes, that's it. And you've no idea who did it? Well, I've got a very good idea. But unfortunately I haven't got any proof yet. There's a bunch run by a chap named Harry Bond. But of course, they've all got nice little alibis. Well, what makes you think they did it? Well, most criminals, Mrs. Wescott, stick to their own pattern in every crime they commit, which is very helpful to us. The time of the crime, the [audio out] car they use. Various ways they go about it. You sure you won't have another? No, thanks, I must get back on the job. Now I must be going too, dear, or your uncle will think something's happened to me. Where are you staying, Mrs. Wescott? - At the Imperial. - Well, let me give you a lift. It's on my way. Oh, that's very good of you. Oh, my bag, dear. Oh, dear. Thank you. Would you like me to phone Uncle Henry and tell him you've been taken away by the police? No, dear, just tell him I've gone off in a car with a handsome man. Goodbye, Barbara. BARBARA EVERTON: Goodbye. - Bye-bye, you two. - So good to see you. JOHN EVERTON: Bye, Charles. Oh, blast this dinner with old Digby. I'd much rather stay and have dinner with you. I don't like books that run into five editions in seven months, dear. You'd better not. Imagine being married to a woman novelist. Oh, some of them are quite nice, surely. They're all so dreadfully competent. Oh, I see. So you married me because I'm incompetent. Nonsense. I married you for your money. Ow! Serves you right. You shouldn't be rude to me. Darling, you will try and be home early tonight, won't you? I'll be back by 10:00 if I have to knock the old boy on the head with one of his books. Good. I'll be waiting for you. Now darling, I must be off. Goodbye. Goodbye. [bird chirping] [jazz music playing] MR. ARDEN: Is Mrs. Everton in? Mr. Arden to see her. BETTY: Mrs. Everton, a Mr. Arden here. Mister who? Arden. Are you sure he doesn't mean Mr. Everton? BETTY: Quite sure. But I-- I don't know anybody called Arden. You best show him in, Betty. Good evening, Barbara. Martin! But-- I suppose it is a bit of a shock, but-- You-- you're-- I'm not dead, if that's what you were going to say. But they said the bomb killed everyone in the house. Mm. That it did. Only I wasn't there at the time. Then-- then why-- Well, I thought it an excellent opportunity to demobilize myself from the Army, take on a new identity, and get free from a Puritan wife. Why have you come here? Can't a man call on his own wife? BARBARA EVERTON: I'm not your wife! I'm afraid you are, my dear. Though the way this fellow is keeping you is much better than I could. John and I are married! You mean, John and you are bigamists? Would you like a drink? No? Would you mind if I do? How did you find me? Sheer chance. I live close by. Sharing a flat with another fellow. I moved in a couple of months ago, and the very next day I saw you in Knightsbridge. So, of course, I followed you. Here we are. Cheers. Mm. Everton certainly knows a good whisky. And I like his taste in women too. There was a time when-- There was a time when a stupid girl of 17 married a man she thought she was in love with. It took her exactly one week to find out what he was like. But it took her 12 months before she was free of him. I was thankful when I heard about that bomb, Martin. A trifle premature, darling. And you're not free of me. What do you mean? I mean, my love, that you and I are one, till death do us part. A sobering thought, but-- If you think for one moment that I would ever come back to you-- No, I can't say I thought that. Nor, indeed, do I want you to. Then what do you want? Money. I've decided to leave England, Barbara. And Incidentally, to leave you in peace for the rest of your life. Then I wish you had done so without telling me that you were alive. No doubt, but I'm afraid that was impossible. I'm broke, my dear. And air passages are strictly cash. I need 500 pounds. I haven't a penny. [exasperated sighing] You disguise the fact admirably. Oh. John has money, but-- Then I must go to John. Please don't do that, Martin. Oh, he wouldn't think it worth 500 pounds to carry on unsuspected in his little love nest? John must never know. I have some jewelry that I can give you. No, I'd much rather have cash. I haven't any cash. But I have a pendant. I haven't worn it for years. John wouldn't miss it. It's worth 600 pounds. Who says so? The insurance company. Well, where is it? Upstairs. [suspenseful music playing] Thank you. Yes, this looks as though it could be worth 600 pounds. This chap evidently seems to be pretty well off, Barbara. I wonder if I were to approach him? You promised you wouldn't! You said if I gave you the pendant that I'd never see you again. Did I? Well. Besides, I find it rather hard to rid myself of this delightful atmosphere. Martin, will you go? If John came back and found you-- Yes? --he'd hand you over to the police for blackmail. I doubt it. Borrowing money from one's wife isn't blackmail, whereas living with someone else's wife is apt to be frowned on in more respectable circles. Not that I blame him. You're a very delightful woman, Barbara. Indeed, speaking as your husband-- Will you get out? And John's coming back in a minute. My dear, John has recently departed in a dinner jacket and a high-priced car and will obviously be away for hours. Barbara, do you remember the day we got married and I was all spruced up in my battle dress, straight from the Glasshouse? Barbara, is this the little girl who promised to love, honor, and obey me? No. It's Mrs. John Everton. Now will you get out? No, I won't. Not until you've kissed me. [exasperated gasp] That was a foolish thing to do, my dear. Still, I suppose all married couples have their little tiffs. Au revoir. [buzzer] You rang? Oh, Betty, when you cleared away, did you move Master Paul's letter? No, I left it just here. Why, Mrs. Everton! Betty said you had a visitor just before you collapsed, an Uncle Arden. Did he upset you? No. No. Who was he, darling? Oh, a man I used to know. It was his wife I knew, really. He had nothing to do with your fainting? Nothing at all. Don't worry, John. I'll-- I'll be all right in the morning. Look here. Either we're going to Paris or we're not. MARTIN RADLEY: We're going to Paris. Then why don't you go and pop this pendant and raise the fare? - Well, I'm going to. It's only just that-- You think they'll think it's stolen. Of course it's not stolen. I was given it legally. Then what are you worried about? You said we were going to take the night plane to Paris, yet here you are with a pendant worth 200 in your pocket. You did say it was worth 200? Yes, that's what it was insured for. 200. My wife says so. Very well, then, go! But of course, I'd never get 200. You don't pawning things. All right, so you only get 100. We still get to Paris, don't we? Yes, we'll go. Where will you be when I get back? Right here, honey. You can't shift little Diana far from the prospect of 100 quid. What'll you give me for it? 50. Oh, don't be absurd. You're right. I'll check first. Check what? Stolen property list. The police send us a list of all-- I know all about what the police do. That wasn't stolen. It was given to me. At the end of a gun? No. At the end of a perfect day. Now what's it worth? Well, it's certainly not on the list. I know it's not on the list. I want 400 for it. Then you better take it back to the shop that sold it. Me, I couldn't sell that with a light. I'll tell you what. I'll make a sacrifice. Seeing as how you come by them honestly for a change, 55. But the thing's worth 600. Not to me, pal. I'll tell you what I'll do. When a piece like this gets stolen-- But it isn't stolen. All right, all right. When a piece like this gets stolen, the assessors offer a reward of 10% of its insured value, which in this case would be 60 quid. So that's what I'll give to you, 60 quid. And it don't leave me a penny profit if I have to hand it back to the owner. Since when did you start handing things back to the owners? Ah, don't get personal, boy. 60 or nothing. [knocking] Why, it's Sherlock Holmes himself. What do you want? A few minutes of your most valuable time, Miss Gower. All right. If you make it snappy. Seen Harry lately? Harry who? Harry Bond. Why, yes, as a matter of fact, I have. He came to lunch yesterday about 1:30. Stayed for a couple of hours. Anyone else see him? How should I know? Sure it was yesterday? Quite sure. Yesterday, 1:30, for a couple of hours. How convenient. Diana! DIANA: Just a minute. I thought I'd have a bath while I was waiting. That old geezer at my place has conked out again. Well, what's wrong with undressing in the bedroom? It's occupied. Occu-- what? Your pal got home just after you left, high as a steeple. Never seen anybody so drunk that could still stand. He reeled into the bedroom and passed out cold, see? Yes, he's drinking too much. Maybe he's worried. Why should he be worried? Seen the midday papers, apart from the racing? No. Ed Strother died this morning. Who? That old jeweler who got shot yesterday. And what's that got to do with anything? Nothing at all. Did you get the money? Yes, I got 30 quid. 30 quid! Well, that's no use, is it? No, of course it isn't. Then you have to see your wife again and tell her you need more. Well, I don't want to unless I can help it. I'll try one or two other lines first, then fall back on Barbara as a last resort. She's far too friendly to the police to my way of thinking. All right. Who are you going to try? [racing announcer on radio] [phone ringing] Hello. McDouglas here. MARTIN RADLEY (ON PHONE): It's Martin Radley. Who? MARTIN RADLEY (ON PHONE): Martin Radley. What do you want? MARTIN RADLEY (ON PHONE): Can you cash me a check for 50 pounds? - Sorry, laddie. I'm broke myself. And we have no money in the office. No go? No. Liar. Whoever's heard of a bookie who's broke? Couldn't you cash a check or something? Where could I cash a check for 200 quid? Well, couldn't you cash a lot of little ones? London being packed with people who trust me. You used to cash checks at that little club of yours. You know, the one you never take me to. Oh, yes, that place. But that doesn't open till 3 o'clock. No, I'll have to prowl around and see if I can raise anything. You better get dressed and run along. I'll phone you up if there's anything to report. [sighing] CHARLES WAYNE: Hello, Ernie. Do you mind if we come in? All right. No. Of course not, Mr. Wayne. I'm investigating the Ed Strother murder, and I wondered if any of the stolen jewelry had come your way. If I was to drop down dead this minute-- Half the crooks in London wouldn't know where to get rid of their stuff. Look, Ernie. I'm not just after an ordinary crook this time. I'm after a murderer. Right, Mr. Wayne. Thanks. Is Maria in the back shop? Yeah. Right. You two can start in there. Over here somewhere, isn't it? Isn't what? Your private safe, where you keep the hot stuff. Well, who said I had a private safe? Oh, a little bird told me. A jailbird. You know, if you paid better prices, Ernie, you'd get more loyalty from your clients. Oh, I see. I don't have to open that if I don't want to. Indeed you don't. I can post a man in front of it and go and get a search warrant. Thanks. Let's have a look at this lot, shall we? Where did this come from? Don't tell him it's hot after all. It's not on the list. Who brought it in? Fella called Smith. Yes, of course, I might have known that without asking. Of course, you've never seen him before in your life, have you? That's right. Is it stolen, Mr. Wayne? Honest, I bought it in good faith. If it's the one I think it is, it must be. Because the lady who owns it doesn't need to pawn things. Keep it locked up, Ernie, I'll ask her tonight. Look, when I asked you for money, I didn't mean you personally. No, I meant the till. I want to cash a check. I'd try to get to the banks, but they would shut before I'd get there. How much for? 50 quid. There may be 50 in the safe. But I haven't got the key. If you come back last thing tonight, the boss might be here. Oh, well, thank you, Gladys. I'll see how it goes. Cheerio. Bye-bye, dear. [phone ringing] Hello? It's no good, Diana. We haven't a chance of getting away tonight. But you said we would. You said tomorrow we'd have breakfast in Paris. We're not going tonight. All right. If we're not going, we're not going. But you better see your wife and raise some money by tomorrow. Look, darling, if you insist on coming to the dance, would you at least cut out the cocktail party at the Fergusons? - No, I won't. I'm going to stop being dreary and I'm going to have a lovely night out. [phone ringing] Brompton 1-4-2-4. Can I speak to Mrs. Everton, please? Speaking-- it's all right, John. It's for me. I've got to see you tonight. But you said last time-- Never mind what I said last time. I've got to see you tonight. You can't. Then I'll have to speak to Everton. No. No, you mustn't do that. I'll have to. No. Look, I can't talk to you now. Give me your number. I'll ring you back. All right. Bronson 6-2-4-3. Yes, I've got that. You better be sure. Yes. Yes, all right. Who was that? It was the man about my driving test. I couldn't be bothered to make an appointment, so I'll ring him in the morning. Oh, I see. John, I-- I think after all I-- I won't go to the cocktail party. You feeling worse? No. But thinking it over, it does seem rather silly. If I rest for an hour, I'll feel much more like a dance. Very well. You will lie down, though, won't you? Yes, of course. I'll be getting along, and I'll call back for you at half past 7:00. I'll be ready. [phone ringing] Hello? BARBARA EVERTON (ON PHONE): Is that you, Martin? Barbara? I've got to see you at once and that's definite. Otherwise, I'm going straight round to tell Everton. Very well. I'll be alone till 7:30. I'll be around shortly. You know that jeweler's dead. MARTIN RADLEY: Yes, I know. That makes you a murderer. And you're an accessory. Oh, no, I'm not. I wasn't even there. And don't try to get away with that one or you'll find out there's such a thing as queen's evidence. No one would let you turn queen's evidence with your record. We'll see. BETTY: Good evening, Mr. Wayne. CHARLES WAYNE: Hello, Betty. Good evening, Charles. You've just missed John. Oh, as a matter of fact, it's you I want to see. Oh. Not officially, I hope. In a way, yes. Goodness, what have I done? Come into the drawing room. I'll tell you all about it. Barbara, have you still got that pendant you used to wear, you know, like a maple leaf? Why? Why do you ask? Well, because I saw it, or its twin brother, this afternoon. Where? In a pawnshop. It was yours, wasn't it? Yes. There's nothing wrong, I promise. But I gave the pendant to someone in payment of a debt. You won't tell John, will you? No, I won't tell him. It's nothing against him, I promise. But I-- I just don't want him to know, that's all. Well, I understand. You don't, you know. But there are times in married life when things occur and, well, you want to spare someone's feelings. No, Charles, you don't understand. You're not married. CHARLES WAYNE: Well, that's very true. I've often wondered why you're not. Have you? Don't you know? How is the case going? Ha, ha, it's not. I thought I'd find a lot of the stolen property this afternoon, but I drew a blank. These fellas are clever. And they've got a lot of women backing up their alibis. We just can't get the truth out of them. As a matter of fact, my side is working on that angle this minute. [music playing] What a mob! All right, you've got exactly four minutes. You told us that at 1:30 on that day, Harry Bond was in your flat. Yes, that's right. He arrived about 1 o'clock for lunch, and he relaxed until 3:00. Well, you might be interested to know that nobody saw him leaving or entering, although the block was quite busy at the time. Well, now, of course not. A girl has a reputation to think of. And Harry's always very careful when he visits me. Which can't be very often these days. What do you mean? Don't you know that he's running around with another girl? That's an old one, and I'm not falling for it. You can't trick me into-- - Miss Gower, please. - Yes, Mr. Hubert? The maestro has decided to show "Jardin des Tuileries" before [french]. So make haste, please. Yes, all right. Am I staying too long? Oh, of course not. I only wondered how long I'd have to titillate before John came back. Well, I should have said you look delightful as you are. But don't worry, I can take a hint. Oh, Charles, you know I wasn't hinting. Of course I do, but I really must go. I can't sit talking to beautiful women and leave all the work to Peter. Do please have another drink, Charles. No, honestly, I must get back to work. Barbara, about this pendant. Are you in any sort of jam? Of course not. Well, I hope that's true. But if it's not, you know I'd do anything in the world to help you, don't you? I do know. Night-night. Good night. [door buzzer] Come in, please, sir. Thank you. This is intolerable! You swore that you'd leave me alone! In return for 500 pounds. That pendant only fetched 60. What? You're lying, Martin. You always were a liar. I wish I were lying, but I'm not. What was Wayne doing here tonight? Do you know him? I know of him. Why was he here? He's a very close friend of ours. Did you tell him about me? Of course not. Yes, I believe you. You're not such a fool. Barbara, you've got to give me the rest of that 500, and in cash, not in jewelry. That's quite impossible. You better find a way of making it possible, or I'll go to Everton about it. How much did you really get for that pendant? 60 quid. I'm not one of those respectable people who can walk into a high-class jewelers and name his own price. You mean you're a crook. I mean that I live by my talents that were given to me. And as I intend to go on doing. So I'm leaving England as soon as you give me 440 pounds in hard cash. I've told you I can't. And even if I could, you'd only come back for more. No, I promise you that. I'm clearing out. If you didn't mean to come back, why have you taken away Paul's letter? Oh, did I take it? That was absentminded of me. I thought it was a charming little letter. I hadn't realized till then that this union of yours had been blessed with a son. Keep him out of it. Oh, I'm afraid that's impossible. If the truth does come out, his position would be rather unconventional. So if you're sure, if you think hard enough, you'll find a way of raising the money. I have some shares. I don't think they're worth more than 400. But perhaps the bank might help. All right. Arrange it tomorrow and I'll overlook the 40-odd. But I must have 400, and in small notes. Very well. What time will you call for it? I won't, my dear. I don't want our family friend to pop in from the terrace with a pair of handcuffs just as I take delivery. No. You'll bring them round to the flat. Where the transactions won't be observed. BARBARA EVERTON: I thought you shared your flat with somebody. I'll see that he's out. Come at 4 o'clock. It's number 14 Kensington Mews. Very well. Don't be late. We have a charwoman who comes in from 5:00 to 7:00. And I'd hate you to be compromised. All right for me to go now, sir? It's gone 7:00. Hm? Oh, yes, I-- You know, you didn't ought to sit there drinking like this. Solitary drinking never did no one any good. Quite right, Mrs. Bunn. Only drunkards drink alone. Sit down and join me. Didn't ought to, really. Wouldn't say no to a little drop. Thank you, sir. Happy days. [bird chirping] Feeling better? Much better. You been having visitors while I was out? Oh, Charles dropped in for a few minutes. Well, he must have been thirsty. He's killed the whisky. - I had some too. - You did? But you hate this stuff. Oh, I thought it might do my head good. And it did. I'm feeling so much better. Let's go as soon as you've had a drink, shall we? I'll go and get my coat. Is he back? Oh. Sorry, dear. Not a sign of him yet. Oh, but your friend was in here. You just missed him. I'll have scotch, please. OK, dear. Splash? Yes, thank you. Ooh! I nearly forgot. He left you a note. Hello, Inspector. Have you still got that pendant, Ernie? Oh, spook. Won't let a bloke make an honest living these days. Here you are. 60 ruddy quid going down the drain. And it still ain't on the list. Maybe not. But I happen to know the lady it belongs to, and I've been authorized to buy it back for her. She wants to buy it? Here, Inspector, look. I won't kid to you. This is honest. That pendant, when it came into the shop, was priced at 600. It's worth a thousand. I'm not kidding. I'll let you have it for, what, 250 quid. What, when you said 60? Did I say that? I must have been mad. Wow, a bloke's got to have a bit of a profit, isn't he, Inspector? I ask you. 16. Don't give me no cuts, Inspector. I'm superstitious about cuts. Now look here, Ernie, I've helped you out once or twice. You wouldn't want our beautiful friendship to break up, would you? Ah, it's extortion, that's what it is. A diabolical liberty. There. - No, no. I won't take it. You send it by registered post to this address. And don't forget. Yeah, sit down and I'll dance to you. Yeah, righto, Inspector. [knocking] Have you got it? Yes. Come in, my dear. No doubt you'll insist on counting it. But I can assure you, there's exactly 400. Well, naturally I'll take your word for it. Thank you. It's been nice meeting you again, Barbara. Goodbye, Martin. Well, now, stay on for a while. Have a drink. No, thank you. Will you get away from the door, please? Well, if you insist. But Barbara-- Yes? I've got to tell you the truth. I'm going to Everton after all. - What? - Well, I'm sorry. I've got to. I'm being blackmailed. And if I don't raise 500 pounds by tonight, he'll hand me over to the police and I'll be arrested at the airport. You've done all you can. My only hope now is Everton. But you can't do that! But I'm desperate. If I buy him out, I can get clear away to South Africa. But if I don't-- You'll go to prison? Mm. For a very long time. Martin, you can't go to John. You promised! Yes, but I didn't know this was going to happen. You're lying again. You're not being blackmailed. And you never had any intention of leaving the country. Here's my air ticket. This is only to Paris. I change to Air France there. Martin. It's made out to Harry Bond. Well, why not? I've been using that name for years. I thought you called yourself Arden. Oh, that was just a little bit of whimsy for your benefit. Do you remember in our garden the poem husband who made himself so obligingly scarce? Everton will be in his office now, I suppose. Piccadilly 4000, isn't it? Martin, I beg of you! You'll ruin John's life, a man you've never even met. Can you get me 500 pounds by tonight? No? Very well. Stand away from that phone! Don't be a fool. And keep back! I told you John will only hand you over to the police. Not when he knows that you've been here today. And if he does turn me in, I'll swear that we've both been meeting regularly. You've always known I've been alive. I never knew that anyone could be so low. You should have learned that during our delirious year together, my dear. The day before yesterday you murdered someone, didn't you? You're Harry Bond. And the police-- The police can prove nothing. Put that gun down. Martin, I'm not going to let you ruin John's life, or Paul's. If you try to make that phone call, I'll shoot! You always were the dramatic type, Barbara. But you can't scare me. You're not worried about John or Paul. You're only worried about yourself. What the neighbors will say when they discover that the nice Mrs. Everton isn't Mrs. Everton at all, but she's John Everton's mistress, and that that darling little Paul is only-- [gunshot] [door closing] Darling? Barbara. Darling, what's the matter? Why? Listen, my dear, this can't go on. You've got to tell me what's worrying you. Ever since that man Arden came on the scene, you look as though you've seen a ghost. A ghost. Yes, that's what it was. What do you mean? His name wasn't really Arden. It was Martin Radley. What? He wasn't killed in the Blitz. He came back to get money. Oh, my darling. Why didn't you tell me? Do you think I'm happy seeing my wife driven half crazy? Thank heavens you've told me at last. I'll deal with this from now on. It's too late. I've shot him. You-- With his own gun. In his flat. I went to give him money. He taunted me. I-- When did this happen? Just now. Oh, John, what can we do about Paul? Barbara, listen. You're quite sure he was dead. Yes. Did you examine him? No. You say you went to give him money. Did you bring it back? It was in his pockets. They may trace it through the bank. What happened to the gun? I dropped it. Oh, John! Barbara, listen. Where is this flat? What's the address? 14 Kensington Mews. - 14 Kensington Mews, right. - What are you going to do? Going round there. You say there's no one else in the place? The man he shares a flat with was out. But there's a charwoman who comes in. What time? 5 o'clock, I think. 5 o'clock? Barbara, you stay here. Don't move from the house. Sorry, Charles. Oh, hello, John. I just thought I'd pop in and see how Barbara is. She seemed a bit under the weather last night. Yes, she's a bit run down. Excuse me, I-- I've got to go and see a bookseller, and he closes at 5:00. - Oh, sure, sure. I'll be back as soon as I can. Well, how are you today? Oh, not too badly, thanks. Would you like some tea or-- or would you rather have a drink? Well, strictly speaking, I suppose it's a bit early for a drink, but, yes, please. I've had a very trying day. Are you still on the Harry Bond case? Yes. Trying to break down these alibis. Still, not to worry. We'll get him in the end. [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Mouse Club. Good afternoon. Gladys, is Harry there? No. No, isn't he with you? No, I've been expecting him since 1 o'clock. He hasn't turned up yet. Well, did you phone him? Yes, I rang the flat and there was no reply. Well, why don't you go round and see him? Yes, I think I will. Bye-bye. [suspenseful music playing] [footsteps] Harry! JOHN EVERTON: For heaven's sake, don't scream. You-- you killed him! No, I found him like that. Who are you? JOHN EVERTON: A business acquaintance. I just came in to see him. Who let you in? The door was ajar. I've only been here a minute. Have you phoned the police? Not yet. I was just going to when I heard you at the door. They'll say I did it. Why? Had you a motive? As much motive as any woman who's been double crossed. That's why I came here. Thought I'd find one of his fancy bits. Oh. Were you in love with him? I was crazy about him. You swear you didn't kill him? I didn't kill him. And you are going to ring the police? It's customary, isn't it? Look. I don't want to get mixed up in all this. Let me go and don't ring the police for five minutes and forget you ever saw me, will you? I promise not to telephone for five minutes after you go. Not to mention you to the police. Thanks. Actually, the simplest cases are often the hardest to solve. I don't understand. Well, you've got so little to go on. What do you mean? Well, I remember a case about-- I say, I must be getting along. What time is it? Well, it's just on 5 o'clock. 5 o'clock. [suspenseful music playing] [footsteps] [screaming] Police! Are you sure you won't wait for John? No, I must go. But the Yard know you're here, don't they? Oh, yes, I always let them know but-- [phone ringing] Hello? Brompton 1-4-2-4. Yes, he's here. It's for you, Charles. Wayne here. Oh, hello, Peter. What? Well, look, I'll be round in a couple of minutes. What's happened? Someone's killed Harry Bond. JOHN EVERTON: Killed who? Harry Bond, the leader of the mob who shot the jeweler. I must go. I'll see you later. Come into the drawing room. I'll tell you all about it. Were Harry Bond and Martin Radley one and the same person? Yes. You're sure he put the money in his pocket? Yes. It's not there now. But that's impossible. Apart from the money, I think I've taken care of everything. PETER THOMPSON: Found anything, sir? Not yet, Peter. Except the obvious fact that Bond was preparing to clear out. He cleared out, all right. I just watched him go. Did you find anything among the neighbors? Yes. They said they saw a girl come in here about 10 to 5:00. The description is the same girl I interviewed, the [inaudible] leaving Yard. 10 to 5:00, eh? I called in to the doctor. He was killed about 4:00. So she must have found the body. I'll go and ask her. I didn't report it. Do that, Peter. I've found something here I'll have to follow up. Did you know Harry Bond? Yes. I did know Harry Bond. He was my first husband. But I thought-- He was dead? So did I. Until this week, when he started blackmailing me. He called himself Arden. How did you find out he was Harry Bond? He showed me an air ticket to prove that he was really leaving the country. His name was on it. Barbara, I've got to ask you this. Where were you this afternoon, say, from half past 3:00 to half past 4:00? This is ridiculous, Charles. Why are you asking Barbara these questions? I'm sorry, John. But Barbara was being blackmailed by a man who was shot between these times. If I don't question her, someone else will. I was in his flat. I killed him. Barbara, you don't know what you're saying. If you only knew what relief it is to say it. I can't believe it. You realize what this means. It wasn't murder, Charles. It was a mad impulse. I wish I could believe that. People who have mad impulses don't wipe fingerprints off guns. But that wasn't-- John-- well, Charles. There's only one thing I can do. Chuck out my job. [knocking] Come in. What do you want? Going somewhere? I was just going to spend a few days in the country with my sister. Your sister is doing six months, as you very well know. What were you doing in Harry's flat this afternoon? So he gave me away after all. Who's this we're talking about? How did you know I was in Harry's flat? Why did you shoot him, Evelyn? Well, I didn't. He was dead when I got there. The murderer was still there. What? Who was the murderer? I don't know. I'd never seen him before. He was tall, fair hair, going gray. He was wearing a brown suit. About 40, I think. Yes. Funny no one else saw him. He was there! He swore he didn't kill Harry and I pretended to believe him. I thought he might kill me too. He said he was going to ring the police. Did he? No, the charwoman phoned the police. All right, don't leave town. Otherwise you might find yourself spending a few days with your sister. ANNOUNCER (ON LOUDSPEAKER): European Airways Flight 4-2-1 to Zurich. Will passengers holding coach card number 5-2-- I suppose there is a flight to Paris tonight. That's right, madam. Flight 2-4-7. The bus leaves in 20 minutes. Thank you. How's it coming, Smitty? Well, I've got the bullet they dug out of Harry Bond. Just hold on a moment. Yes, here it is. The bullet that killed Harry Bond. Thanks. Fired from the same gun as the one that killed the jeweler. That's impossible. My dear chap, if you think I don't know when two bullets have been fired from the same gun-- Sorry, Smitty. Hm. Wait till the old man hears about this. Pint, please, ma'am. Oh, there you are, sir. I've been looking all over the place for you. Just come from ballistics. The bullet they dug out of Harry Bond. Well, you can give it to Mr. Carstairs. I'm turning over all available evidence to him. I'm resigning. Resigning? What on earth for? .45 nickel plated. But the gun we found was a .38. Precisely. Did you get anything out of Harry's girlfriend? Yes. There was a stranger in the flat when she got there. A man, tall, very broad, fair hair going gray, about 45-- you think he did it? I know he didn't. But he was the fellow who wiped off all the fingerprints and gave me a completely wrong slant on the whole business. Peter, I've got it. There were no air tickets in that flat when we searched it, were there? - No, there weren't, sir. It's funny. Only the other day I was telling somebody how criminals always repeat their tricks. Come on. There's just a chance. [fast-paced music playing] ANNOUNCER (ON LOUDSPEAKER): Will passengers for Flight Number 1-2-6 to Vienna please take their seats on the coach waiting at exit number 4. [chatter] Will passengers for Flight Number 1-2-3 to Madrid please take their seats on the bus waiting at exit number 3. Will you phone up Scotland Yard and ask them to send a squad car along immediately? You'll be two passengers short on this trip. It's Inspector Wayne. If I were you, I'd get along home. We'll want to speak to you later. Not the first time you pretended to be dead, eh, Radley? But last time you pinned it on Hitler, not on your wife. On his wife, sir? A development you don't know about, Peter. Radley got her to visit his flat and left Harry Bond's gun where she could find it loaded with blanks. Then he goaded her on until she became hysterical and fired it at him. But as soon as she'd gone, he came to life again and brought in the body of Harry Bond, whom he'd shot a few minutes earlier. But you forgot to switch the guns, Radley. Otherwise you might have got away with it. You hadn't time, I suppose, was that it? I had every intention of switching the guns. I don't suppose you thought it would matter. You didn't think we'd know the difference between a 4-5 and a 3-8. Well, even police officers have that intelligence. No. It was pure sentiment. I didn't want to involve Barbara in murder. Give her my love, Wayne. ANNOUNCER (ON LOUDSPEAKER): Attention, please. Oh, here's a car. Come on. ANNOUNCER (ON LOUDSPEAKER): British European Airways Flight 4-2-7 to Paris. Will passengers holding coach card number 5-4 please go through gates A and B. CHARLES WAYNE: Even then he was only beaten by 10 minutes. I can't believe it. You'll have to, I'm glad to say. Martin Radley was never known as Harry Bond. He killed Harry because Harry was blackmailing him. The gun you fired was loaded with blanks. Get it? No. And here's another thing that might interest you both. This is Radley's marriage certificate dated 1938. And his wife is still alive. Then Barbara was never legally married to him. That's right. You've only had one husband in your life. And I think I'll leave you to him. Good night. I think we might give this to Paul. Oh, I think he'd much rather have a yacht. Come and have a drink with your husband. [music playing]
