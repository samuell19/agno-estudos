Emergency situation occurred! Emergency situation occurred! Help. Brother. Let them go first, I guess they are all waiting. Okay. Wait. Give me the knife. Except for the guys on the phone right now.

I'm running away in order to live like a human. But you stinking idiot, I saved you, you should say thank you. You ungrateful douche bag. Just be a good boy and go back to Korea.

Must have been fixing something. But where did you get the beer? When I went to the restaurant, there was beer there. Would you like to join me for a drink? No, I can't drink. But where have you been? Oh, down there. That's not important. That's the sound of gunfire. On my way here, I met the interrogators with their guns. If you're so worried, I'll go out and see what's going on. Don't go out there. There are a lot of criminals out there. How can a doctor be so timid. You're not very attractive to women, are you, doctor? What a lack of charm. You have so little guts. It's okay, it's okay. The fortune teller said this year that I have bad fortune. You really do everything. If it's so good, why don't you drink it. You have worked hard. It's all moved over. Good. No soju now. You smoke a cigarette and go somewhere nice. Now this is not a problem, right? You guys can't come down here for that. Please go up. It's okay, don't be afraid. Where's the satellite phone? EC. Say something understandable, dammit. Engine control room over there. Those two guys, you go over there and smash it. You go along too. Seniors. What? F♪♪k. Where did they all go? Where are the others? I don't know.

We need to tell the Korean side of the situation first. It says that the engine room can contact with Korea. Why did you bring this uncle? Without me, the boat would have stopped. That's what they said. I'm the chief engineer. Forget it, get him done, let's go. Good. Let's go. Uncle you get off work. What are you doing? Don't go too far. Park Jung-do, you jerk. This dumbass.

I said don't move, dumbass. Jung-do, I told you, this is not a boat you can escape from. I'm so mad, Who's the one who should escape now? Stick a knife in your mouth, for f♪♪k's sake. F♪♪k! Stupid motherf♪♪ker! Hide, hide! Shit! Brother, brother, quick. Shit. Out of the way, damn it. Stinky bitch, shit. F♪♪k all of you, you stupid bastards. F♪♪k you. Nothing is different. This is hell.

It doesn't look like the ship is sinking. Enlarge more. The stern looks fine. What is that? Why is it red over there? Enlarge that area. F♪♪k. I knew. The criminals are going to do evil. What is the police doing on the ship? Son of a bitch. Director Pyo Report? You are joking. You are too arrogant. I am doing my job as you have asked. I already knew about the situation. The situation? Don't talk too much. Just make it simple. Officer Oh, you should go there by yourself. Go there by myself? Me? The ship is coming now. Oh my, you are really out of you mind. Do you think coastguards and Ministry of Defense will support us? There are dozens of people on that ship. How can I catch that guy? You should say something realistic. It was you who said it's fine to let him get on the ship and lose all faculties. It was you who said... F♪♪k. Then what do you want me to do? I only said alpha should get on the ship. I didn't say the criminals should be there too. Now things have gone really bad. But why should that blame on me? It's you that pretend to know nothing. What do you want me to do? Son of a bitch. Listen. The naval base you will see in front of it belongs to The U.S. Army. Just shut up. And bring alpha to me. Hey, you son of a bitch. Hey. F♪♪k. Son of a bitch. Shut up. You have no manners. You should knock on the door first. Is it your first time seeing someone in the toilet? Why are you so late? Tell me the truth. Did you forget me? What are you talking about? All in all, I came. Nonsense. Hello. Hi. What's that all over your body. F♪♪k, you're driving me crazy. Just Stop it. Hey. I gave you money, right? Shit. Can you see this? Can you? Can you? You should have done it well. Turn around. Why are you always sitting at here? I need to change my clothes. But I don't have any. You crazy bitch. Help me with this. What a psycho. Don't follow me. You said you would help me. When? Hurry up. What's going on? You were nervous too much. Why do you sleep in my room? Sir, wake up. I heard something weird. Is it the sound of shooting? You always say it's shooting. No, it's not. It sounds like wailing. Or maybe it's something fell down. It's lifeboat. But why is it loosened? Help! Help! Sir, WHat's going on? There's no time. He's chasing after me. Just let me go. He did that in front of me. Why are you always treating me like this? Calm down. What did you just say? She's dead. He's in the medical room now. It's there undoubtedly. I gave hypnotic... Say it clear. The monster's eyes are sewed up just like a dead body and he wears the clothes like that. What's that? Tell us everything. I have no idea. I just follow the orders. What are you asked to do, bastard? I took annual leave. He asked me to give hypnotic every six hours and offered me a lot of money. I only followed the order. Is it the association? Yes. Is it the place that sells you vitamins that makes you ten years younger? Yes. There are faculties from the company in my room. They probably know about this. Whatever. There's medicine on the lifeboat, right? Yes, but it is destroyed. Oh no. I have put some in the basement. Go check it. I will find others. Alone? No, It's too dangerous. I will go with you. It's all right. There should be at least one police to go and search. However... Let's go. Let's Hurry up. Jung Du is in the engine room. My Jung Du. He finally can get out of the jail. Although he is rude, he is quite clever, right? What the hell, you son of a bitch. Who are you? Let's leave. Sir. I say, just go. Hurry up, bitch. Help, Help. Hurry up. Where is the destination? Hey. Quiet. The door shouldn't be opened. What are these? Oh my god. Sir. Let's go. What's this? Come here. My legs. It's a slight scratch. The wound seems not so deep. This is gonna hurt. Easy. Easy. Do you need treatment? Didn't you get hurt? I see you bleeding. It's kind of painful. We don't have anesthetic. Please do it gently. Ok, I will. This is Japanese. This is the criminal we just met. His name is Kim Wan Gyu. He was born in 1911. 1911? He's about my grandfather's age. This doesn't make sense. He was imprisoned in Korea, Ceong Do Bu in 1943. He joined Japan's aggressive war against the Philippines. He was put inside of a Japanese POW camp on the west side of Mindanao Island. He received an AA level diagnosis which is the most idealistic result in the Japanese experiment of inventing human weapons. A human weapon? Experiment? What on earth... Let me help you. That is, he has been alive from then on. But why is it a secret? Follow me. Come here. Be quick. What are you doing? Come on. Experiment subject Alpha. Experiment subject Alpha has the side effect of conducting indiscriminate violence. And it shows that Alpha suffers from severe trauma. Why does it stop? Why does it stop? Just go down quickly. Alpha only reacts to people's behaviour. It preserves the genetic characteristics of wolf. And it's sensitive about sound and the smell of blood. It is 5 times stronger than normal human. Get down. Oh shit, Its not opening. It won't open. What's more, according to the fact that cellular aging doesn't happen on its body. It can live much longer which indicates the new possibility of human's evolution. It's the same as cancer cell. They are crazy. How much longer do people want to be alive? The whole world is crazy. Are there more about Alpha? Wait a second. I think we can find more. I will take a look. The third laboratory is Japan's concentration camp in the Philippines. Stop taking photos. The surgery has finished successfully. What's going on? Kill it. Bastard. Help! Don't come to me. Go away. Hold on. Stop it. Let him go. Sir, sir, do something. Help! Son of a bitch. I won't let you go. Let's die together. No. My dear. My dear. I am sorry. Shit, just get up now. What's that sound? Let's go. OK. My dear. Go. Hurry up. Officer, this is Kim Tae Jun speaking. Frontier Titan has been found 20 minutes ago. It is detected as remaining still. Ok. Get ready. What's that. Come on. What are you doing? Don't come out. Shit. I should at least break your arm so that I can say something to my friends who have been sacrificed. Son of a bitch. It's the sound of helicopter. They come to save us, right? Did you contact Korean government? - No, there's no signal. - Maybe it's captain. Yes, that's it. Where are you going? Be quick. Wait for me. Are you the guys with helicopter? Those people are... There's a psycho acting like a monster and killing everyone. Like a monster? The police are also killed. The monster is killing everyone. And he kills people like he kills a bug. I have no idea. I don't know. I have no idea. I need to get out of here. Help me. Bitch, you are too noisy. Blah Blah blah, you are talking too much. I have no time. I am the police. Don't move. What are you showing off, bitch? You should have done your job better. I just need you to arrive Taiwan. Is it so hard? Shit, all of you are dumb. Let's go. Let's go. Put down your guns. Who are you? You are still contemptible. It's you, bastard. How have you been? You expect to get on the ship with Alpha and arrive in Korea to find us, right? That's why you give me so much trouble. You should have known. Why did you do that? What are you talking about? We make a good use of those people who are going to die. Is that wrong? It's not me. Don't lie to me. You kill them. No. I said it's not me. Go to hell. Today's goods are so fresh. Son of a bitch. Hurry up and pack them up. Come on, pigs. It's lucnch time. Come on, pigs. Come on, pigs. Today's winner in the game earns 30 points more than the loser. Are you all right? We saved you. But you bastards don't know how to be grateful and bring me trouble. You won't get hurt and old. It's so wonderful. I understand. You should have come with the faculty. Why did you make me find you by myself? Is it a son or a daughter? It has been a long time ago. I don't even remember. Son of a bitch. That guy appears again. Oh no. Why does this guy intervene. Let's just take his head. Fire. These guys are useless. Hilarious Come this way. Come on. Actually, It's a pity to kill you. Don't move. Who are you? You don't need to know. Take us to Korea. I can't. The helicopter needs refueling. Shit, What can we do? Find out the nearest place to go. Please get out of this place. What a pity. This bastard has died. I should at least take you back so that I won't be blamed. Am I right? Animals shouldn't imitate humans. Just come with me when I talk gently to you. Otherwise, things will be really bad for you. Now I remember when I see you like this. Father, father. Now I remember your baby's face. . It's not easy to move them. It's a better idea that we should get it done here instead of in Korea. Well I am not sure about that. They are so wild and aggressive. It's not easy. And not to mention the cost of management. We will pay for it. Our work is inherently dangerous. They are animals which can't even talk. Please understand. Please.
