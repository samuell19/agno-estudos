Laurent Fignon should win it by a margin of 30 seconds over Arroyo. Just under 1 kilometre to go now. That's right. THE LAST BREAKAWAY The treatment hasn't produced the results we expected. We'll have to review our plans. I'll be honest with you, Laurent. You and I know each other well. You need another 6 to 8 months of treatment. What about the Tour? Out of the question, Laurent. I'm going whether you like it or not. Try and stop me. I've already missed the start. I hear you, but... I will not lose this race to this illness! - Understand? - No, but... Didn't you hear me? No Tour de France. Seriously! I'm not deaf. Martine, the good news is: I'm very ﬁt. We should be glad. Still no holiday! Laurent, I'm sorry. I'll say hello to your wife. ls it going OK with him? He's not my favourite patient. I hate cycling and everything it stands for. It upsets me when I see him. Eddy. can I see you for a minute? See you in a bit. Yes? He's going anyway- Excuse me? - On the Tour. Laurent's going. - But... I've known him for 20 years. The man's so stubborn! 3,000 km in 3 weeks, in his state. And the live broadcasts. Last year, he was exhausted. What can we do? We can't monitor him 24/7! Eddy. can I ask a small favour? Tour de France, 2010 Finish ...the last hours of this stage where we'll see the men separated from the boys. Before that, we welcome the cavalcade and sponsors. In the last few kilometres, Cancellara, the world's best ﬂat racer, is currently riding a superb race for Andy Schleck, driving him on perfectly... Thor Hushovd, the Norwegian, retakes the lead. Geraint Thomas is in champion Jose Gutiérrez' slipstream, hailed as the next big name and part of this breakaway... he started cautiously... Hello. I'm Dr Clavel. I was told to report here. - Here you go. - Thank you. Excuse me. The France Televisions bus? - Over there. - Thank you. He played football at school, he was a goalkeeper. Hello. Mr Clavel? Yes. Valérie, Laurent's wife. Thanks for coming. Thank Dr Chevalier. - Ah! Gégé. Alright? - Valérie! Super. Big day. We've the cobbles still to come. With your pass, you can go where you like. You're in the same hotel as us. What a joy! So, you won the jackpot. That's right. Hello. Can I see you in private for a ﬁrst check-up? Right now? - Well, yes. - We're live. They're on the cobbles. Didn't you see? No. It's not ﬁnished? Not really. I came out for a drink, but I have to go back in. He's funny! When is it over? In 3 hours. Hello? Tour bus, please? "Tour bus": very funny! If someone had told me I'd be clowning around on the Tour to get tenure, I'd have become a vet. Anyway, I've looked at the race route. We're near Luchon on the 19th. We could meet after your 1st scan. Yes. Deﬁnitely. Hello? Eh? What was that? I said that would be great. Whose voice is that behind you? Right. I love you. I miss you. I want to kiss your tummy. It's really grown. I look like a whale. Hello? Hello? We're nearing the end of this long stage, 213 km. The riders are near the Porte du Hainaut ﬁnish. We're with the chasing pack and Alberto Contador, who continues to lose a bit of time. But the Spaniard has, I think, limited the damage today. He'll lose a minute to his rivals, mind you. There were cobbles, though. - It's not too bad. - It's a lot, Thierry. Anyway. Last bend. Last bend with Cancellara bringing along Andy Schleck who'll be high up in the general standings. We'll now focus on the sprint, launched by Thor Hushovd. He's on the right. He set off early, but he's strong. A win for the Norwegian, ahead of Geraint Thomas, Cadel Evans 3rd, Ryder Hesjedal, then Fabian Cancellara with Andy Schleck. An impressive win for Thor Hushovd here, in a stage that will matter in this 2010 Tour de France. Cue credits. Why did you make me talk to him? We haven't talked in 3 years. To ﬂatter him too! Hang on. Live broadcasting's like that! You must admit you... fell out with half the peloton! I didn't fall out with them, they fell out with me. Mr Fignon, I've an old recording that I can't date. Could you help me? Who are you? - Hugo, the editor. - OK. I'm coming. Bloody annoying. He knows: 3 years we haven't talked! Go on. Show me. Fignon. Ah. That really hurts. I can still feel it now. It was Blois-Chaville, 1982. Blois-Chaville, OK. '82. I was good-looking, eh? Still here, Doctor? Hurry up, boss. We have to go. I'm coming. Stay focused. Podium ceremony in 2 minutes. - When do I see you, then? - I've got things to do. - Such as? - A radio show, 2 interviews, a sponsor's do... And a book too, I bet? Yes, several chapters. But that's tonight. See ya. - Where are you going? - To Reims! The next stage. It's the Tour de France! Didn't you know? You travel around France. Stop following me around. It's annoying. I'll just see you at the hotel. I'll see you in the morning. You misunderstand me. I'm here to look after you, not for your autograph. But, as you're not bothered, you can talk to Mrs Chevalier and explain why I left. I don't like being taken for a clown. Hello. We're looking for a taxi in your area. - Please be... - Dr Clavel, excuse me. - Are you going? - He doesn't need me. You're wrong. Maybe, but you can't force a patient to have treatment. His suffering makes him like that. He's ashamed. I know he's hard, arrogant. That he moans. I've had 13 years of it. He's behaved badly so often in front of me and friends. He's been awful. But he's always said sorry: he's not a bad guy. But he's a champion, and champions are... OK, but... Listen. He hasn't eaten in 3 days and is sick every morning. He tells me he's OK, but... I know he's not. I understand you're annoyed. He can be an idiot. But he's my idiot. And I love him. So, please, stay. Just a few days. Please. A grey Skoda will arrive in 15 minutes. To conﬁrm, press 1... If he's not in his room at 9am tomorrow, count me out. Thank you. Can you hear me? Go on. Back a bit. Stop. OK. Go forward now. OK. That's ﬁne there. Forward. Forward. Forward. Stop. Right. Reverse now. Back up. Damn it. - Morning. - Morning, sir. Shall we go travelling after the Tour? Have some time together? It'd do us good. What's your island off El Salvador called? Fernando de Noronha. I don't know, darling. They might need me for the Vuelta a Espaﬁa. And... the World Championships too, eh? Laurent... Hang in there. Don't give in, I beg you. I beg you. We'll get through this. Eh? - Good morning. - Hello. Can I see Mr Fignon? It'll be hard this morning. Valérie, it's OK. Let him in. Well? Like a young man? Will the Faculty let me continue? I'll send these off. Resu|ts‘|| be back soon. You don't like cycling. I knew it. I've run into a cyclophobe. You do sport? I run. He runs. You run? No way! The most boring sport on Earth. You run about alone like a prat, puffing... All that to win what? ls that all that matters? What, you believe "it's taking part that matters"? That's a load of rubbish. Am I released? Before you go, I'd like us to establish a few rules. First: you must take a 1/2-hour break during commentaries. As soon as you feel too nauseous, you stop. Any headaches, dizziness, you stop. Obligatory check-up before going to the next stage. If you're not well, no commentary. By the way, your wife agrees. I'll come for you at noon. Until then, you must not leave your room. Get some rest. OK. Fine. I get the message. Mind if I ditch the formality? You've just felt me up: we're intimate friends. Eh, mate? See you later, Mr Fignon. ‘Epernay ‘Montargis *Gueugnon - Hello? - Never try to do a table plan! Just get as far away as possible. Wedding preparations going well then? They're mad, Eddy: my daughter, my husband, my mother-in-law... She's had to wait, mind you. How is it with Laurent? Hard at the start, but we had a good talk. He now has to rest in his room. Well done. I knew you'd be a great villain in this story. Thanks. I sent you the samples for analysis, by courier. Good. We'll assess them. Meanwhile, stay assertive. No way! Eddy? Are you there? Eddy? Hello? Eddy? Hinault attacked, unlike Schleck. It was stupid. He had more than 100 km to go. It showed style, though. - And he was right. - No matter how good he was, that was stupid. Where did he come, eh? Er... 3rd, only 3 seconds behind Vallet in 1st place and Bonnet in 2nd. - Jean-Paul, you annoy me. Laurent never changes! You were a pain in 1983, a bigger pain in 1986 and you continue to piss us off in 2010. How often were you voted the most hated sportsman? Very good question. Whatever, Statler and Waldorf! Journalists always hated my guts. That's why. And I know it well since I became a consultant. Hey there! My nanny! Come, Doctor. Come, let me introduce you. The great Gérard Holtz. Mr Jean-Paul Ollivier or Paulo la Science, and Vincent Barteau, alias Baba, my old team-mate and best friend. - May I speak to you? - Gentlemen, duty calls. What's going on? I'm talking to friends: another no-no? I told you to get some rest. Just stop it, would you? Listen: I love life, laughing, reading, shagging, eating well: MN' \ \\\ \. 'M \ \ I. Illness isn't going to take that away. I don't fear death. - I just don't want to die. - We must face reality. We both know what that is: I know what you're going through. Trembling hand, twitching eye... You hide it, but I see you're suffering. You know, I read somewhere that those who get annoyed are twice as likely to catch a bug. So watch out. You'll have troubles too. It never used to be like this: traffic islands and roundabouts don't simplify cyclists' lives, especially in this final. The last roundabout. We're near the end of this stage to Gueugnon. Quickstep going well. Mark Cavendish alone facing his destiny on the home stretch and ﬁrst to accelerate. Oh, a fall! What a fall! Oh, I don't believe it! What are they doing?! Look at Cavendish. They're taking too many risks. We know the Brit is a specialist track racer: trained on the track, an acrobat. I'm a doctor too. Can I help you? Help me move him. Careful. Well? OK? He's got concussion and a broken right collarbone. Are you OK? Want to go again tomorrow? He's riding tomorrow? Well, we saw it yesterday. For the Dutch team, only a ﬁnal victory matters. Excuse me. Tomorrow, it's the mountains, the Alps. Contador was ﬁne on the ﬂat. He's in form and will be on the terrain he likes best. Well noted. The Tour is taking the high road. We'll see you, as always, on Europe tomorrow. No, not tomorrow. I'm having some tests. As you can hear, this illness has its highs and lows. I'll see you the day after. That's class: Laurent Fignon has tests, but also livens us up! Thank you. We'll see you the day after tomorrow. - Thank you. - Bye. Look at his face! Hello. You OK, Doctor? - You're all pale. What's up? - Nothing, but that sprint rider cracked his skull and half his bones, and he's riding tomorrow. You wimp. Shall we go? Look... That's the profession. If you knew how often I was hurt in my career... Pain is part of a rider's life. Have you ever been hurt in your life, apart from when you had your BCG done? I'm supposed to admire you because you're masochists? He always wants to have the last word. He's good at it, isn't he? He's with me. It's ﬁne. Gate, pass, pass, gate, badge... This is no life. Wrong. It's the opposite. This is freedom. Look. Speeding along the roads with no limits. Problems start when the Tour's over. Then you hit the red light: normal life. Too right! - Hey! Where are you going? - I've a local radio show to do. We're off. Will you miss me? - Good evening. - Good evening. Good evening. Baba... want a drink? I'm not sleepy. No. I'm knackered. I checked the pacenotes. Early start tomorrow. I'm off to bed. Sleep well. Good night, Baba. Campari champagne with 2 olives, Mr Fignon? - Ah! Good old René. - How nice! You well? - I thought: "Isn't he coming this year? Have I upset him?" Work, René. Work, you know. I was thinking, the other day, when I saw you on TV: how long have we known each other now? 10, 15 years? The amount of times I've been here... it must be that. I was still riding back then. I think you were. Seen my daughter? She was born in October. Half-Madagascan. She's wonderful, René. I gave her the name you said. Valérie. Ah. yes! Very good. Someone's thinking straight, here in Chambéry. You'll see her next year: she has to meet you! Next year? I don't know if I'll still be alive, René. - It's shit to die at 50. - Don't talk like that, Laurent. Have faith. You're a winner. You're Laurent Fignon. You mustn't forget it. That's true, René. I tend to forget it, these days. Good night. Good night, Mr Fignon. *Chambéry 'Gap *Sisteron *Bourg-lés-Valence *Bourg-de-Péage ‘Mende *Rodez *Reve| For a small town like ours, welcoming the Tour de France is an historical event. And welcoming Mr Laurent Fignon today is truly legendary: a legend that he created from his mighty legs since his ﬁrst successes in 1983. Everyone remembers his ﬁrst Tour de France, won at barely 22 years of age. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'm very happy to be here in Revel: Fignon the rebel in Revel! Excuse me. I'm especially proud to receive the keys to the town, even if I don't know what they open. Perhaps, even, the gates of heaven. And thank you for keeping me dreaming, even if certain very mundane people endeavour desperately to bring me back to a much more morose reality. Thanks for these moments of escape that do me such good. What was that? I was given an honour. I told you not to go out without my consent. You should be resting. We need a serious chat. - Let's talk seriously, then. - Fine. You've been pissing me off for 10 stages now. You're everywhere. I can't breathe. You're like a leech. I've had enough of you, Doctor! Yes, you do your job well. Too well, even. I hate guys who overdo it. My peloton had them. I was told you were arrogant in the peloton. Nothing has changed, then. I was, I admit it. My critics were idiots. Sorry, I always prefer panache over mediocrity. Mediocrity appeals to your type. You're too normal to understand me. Too rigid. Don't worry: we're entering an age of yes men, wet ﬂannels, political correctness. You'll have a great time! Stop saying that. I'm not rigid. I'm afraid you are. A bit of advice for you: loosen up. Become what you are. A good guy. Deep down, I think you are a good guy. - Come for a drink, mate. - I'm not your mate. As you wish, mate. - Shall I put this one ﬁrst? - Yes. Evening. - Evening. - Hi. - What are you doing? - Things we'll show during the race: interviews, archive footage, etc.. I was thinking. Can you tell me 2 or 3 things about Laurent Fignon? I'm in the dark. - What do you basically know? - Well... that he has glasses, that he's blonde. - OK. Not much, then! Come and sit here. Come. First, he's not some Sunday cyclist. He won the Tour the 1st time he was in it. He'd only been cycling for 5 years. He did it again the following year, 1984, against that era's greatest rider, Bernard Hinault. 4 Tours de France to his name, he wanted a 5th. The badger. That was his nickname: the badger. Show him. It'll be easier. OK. That's Alpe d‘Huez. Watch how he dispatches him, one of the greatest cyclists of all time. Laurent's only 23 there. I always dreamed of doing that. Talent like Lo|o‘s is very rare. You ask me: "Who is Laurent Fignon?" Well, Laurent Fignon is 80 victories, Show him. It'll be easier. 2 Tours de France, tons of stage wins. On a bike, he was God. Then, there was 1989. 1989? What was that? 1989. The most legendary Tour of all time. Everyone knows about his last stage on the Champs-Elysées. You seriously don't know? VagueW- VagLIe|Y7 We'd better show him. - Put it on. - I'll try to ﬁnd it. I don't believe it. I was sure I had it. It must be on my other hard drive. Too bad. I'll tell it. So... Sunday 23 July, 1989, France is basking in sunshine. Lolo leads the general classiﬁcation over Greg LeMond. He's ahead by 50 seconds. All that remains is a time tria] on the Champs-Elysées. LeMond speeds off. He does his best time ever. No worries, Fignon has a 50-second lead: enough to win. Also, Laurent's a time-trial specialist. That said, seconds go by at each checkpoint and Fignon is late. Very late. His 50-second lead slips away as each kilometre goes by. 40. 30... He continues to lose time. 20... 10... I held my breath at the ﬁnish. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... - What? He lost? - By 8 seconds. 8 little seconds. After 3 weeks and more than 3,000 km of the hardest racing in the world. I thought he couldn't lose. His arse was sore. Saddle soreness. That's not the issue. The issue was that Lolo had just entered the history books by way of defeat: the worst thing that could happen. Because from that moment on, what he won before or after didn't matter. Forget his 2 Tour victories. He'd be remembered as the man who lost by 8 seconds. 8 little seconds. You OK? Yeah, ﬁne. Were you...? It's nothing. It's the pollen. - Am I disturbing you, Laurent? - No more than usual. You called me "Laurent". I wanted to apologise for earlier. I got carried away. And I'm sorry for badgering you. Forget about it. I'm not easy either, I know. Relax a bit, Doctor. Enjoy the show. Did you always want to cycle? Are you trying to chat me up? - No. I'm getting to know you. - To know me. Now there's something! Er, I don't really know. What can I tell you? I got into it when I was 14, 15 with my father's bike. All I know is, I've never liked losing. I've never liked being restricted. You've got to be bigger than life. Bigger than life, mate. Otherwise, there's no point. It's funny, isn't it? I always did things because I wanted to be liked, but I always opened my big mouth, even if I was sure to get a hard time. In your job, I bet some people don't like you, with your white coat and that poker up your arse. Let's say not everyone likes me. We've got something in common. But I've decided not to give a damn. Like me or not, I don't care. - How did you become a doctor? - I always wanted to be one. Well, I thought I did. I now wonder if I'm cut out for a career in a clinic. I can deal with illnesses, but sick people's moods and complaints every day... Their rants? At times, I feel I can't talk to them. I'm even thinking about resigning. What would you do? I'd go and work in a research lab. You may be one of my last patients. It would have to be me. Doc, make a wish. Shit. Missed it. We're more observant when we're ill. Life's fucked up. You see all the beauty when it's over. Right. Good night, Doc. Welcome to Pamiers, the scene of this 16th stage in the Tour de France, linking the communes of Pamiers and Bagnéres-de-Luchon. The festivities will be in the village square... I must love you, to come all this way! Not too tired, my love? You're cute in your Tour-de-France shirt. It's Badgeland, here! Well? Show me. I haven't opened it. I waited. There it is. It's small. It's very small, actually. - D‘you think you were bigger? - Yes, I reckon. See that thing? That means it's a boy. It's mad. It shouldn't have such an effect on me. The silliest thing in the world. I'm going to have a son! La Marmite. Good evening. A table for 2. Well, 2 and a half, now. - For dinner. - One moment, please. You show-off! I love it! Carry on like that. Doctor! You've even followed me here? Laurent, meet Pauline. Evening. Valérie, my wife. Evening. He's happy. _ Did he win at jogging? He's found out we're having a son. No way! Congratulations. A kiss. How wonderful. Thank you. It may be bad for me, but we're having champagne! Make sure he does sport. It's important to start early. By the way, I said sport, not jogging. Any ideas about a name? Gustave. - Ah. - Gustave... Are you joking? - No. - Pauline, don't let him do it. We're discussing it. We're not 100% sure, my darling. What? Hang on. Gustave is nice. It was my grandfather's name. You said you liked it. But I'm not 100% sure. Doc, you're a good lad, but what will it be like for him at school? We'll call him Laurent, then. Why not! I didn't dare say it... you must admit, Laurent Clavel has a better ring than Gustave. Some after-dinner drinks on the house. For me. Not for her. - I'll have that one too. - Drinking heavily, Doc? - Here's to little Clavel. - Cheers. To little Clavel. I've a question that's been bugging me: How can a girl like you be with a guy like him? I'll explain. He caught me in a moment of weakness. I broke my hand. He was an intern. He wrote his number on my cast. - Ah, how sweet! - Adorable. I bet you did that with every girl. Don't lie. Yes, but only she rang back. That's lovely. It's funny to see you, Laurent. Meeting you is a big deal for me. My family never missed the Tour de France. See, she's interested: take a leaf out of her book. We were more into Hinault. We weren't so into you, but... OK. I understand. The bill, please. I don't want to know. The bill! I'll tell you why... At the time, you had a bit of an odd image, didn't you? The intellectual in the peloton... - Am I right? - I'll say this... that image is because of my glasses. No one ever thought that I wasn't able to wear contacts. Try riding in a peloton when you can't see 6 feet ahead. But the guys were jealous. That's why they persecuted me. It's not my fault that the birds always fancied me! - Even with that hairstyle? - It was a ponytail, actually. What? It's true that you've had some dodgy hairstyles, my darling. Unbelievable! How dare you. I liked my ponytail. Why‘re you giving me a hard time? Doc, help me out here! Doc? Sorry. It's my mum. I forgot to call her after the scan. Excuse me. Hello, Mum? I'm sorry. Forgive me. A boy! A little boy, mate. Yep. I'll settle up. Sorry, sir, it's already done. Well, there you go. I told you so. He's paid it all! You didn't need to, Doc! Really! Thank you! I'll treat you next time! Come on, mate. Hey guys. sorry to say it again, but you can't do it. - What? - It'll be a disaster. What? - Gustave... - Stop it. Leave them be. They can do what they like. Right. OK. Good night. See you. - Good night, Laurent. - They don't realise... He's a good man, your cyclist. You spoke tonight. It's good! Yes. And? Nothing. I love you being like that. You're less... You're less rigid, that's it. You're not a lab rat, actually. Why "actually"? Stop. Right, go forward now. OK. That's enough. Forward. Forward. Slop! No! Go right! Biological analysis results - Hello. - Hello. - You running too? - Much to Laurent's horror. Yes. I know it well. - A good night? - Yes. He couldn't get to sleep, so we went for a drink. Thanks for yesterday. It was fun. Your wife's lovely. I know my bloke isn't easy, but he's passionate. Everything excites him. Yes. I noticed. I'm trying to get him to go on holiday. For 10 years, he's promised me a honeymoon. He still has things to do. Maybe we'll go at New Year. What's another 6 months, eh? What? Problem? No, but I just received the... I know what you're thinking, but I need something to cling to. But Laurent has always managed to surprise me. He's the toughest guy I know. Excuse me. Yes. Thanks for calling back so quickly. Have you seen the results? The markers have shot up again. I'll need to analyse it. OK. I'll wait for your call. Want me to come to the station? No. Don't worry, darling. Eddy, ﬁght for Laurent. I like that man. Finish - Jam? - No, thanks. I'll say one thing: it's not a great Tour. - You say that every Tour. - Because it's true! They're scared to attack. It's not my fault! - It's not my fault either. - Mine neither. Lolo, it's not our fault either. Have a little rest before we go. I'm OK. We can start without you. Get off my back! That's all I ask. |‘m sorry. You worry me, Laurent. Have faith in me, Gégé. OK? Just for a few days. D‘you still believe in me? To the end, Laurent. Right to the end. Oh, shit. No way! Wait. I'll be back. - Hello. - Hello. Can I have my bill? - Which room? - 622. - I'll do it now. - Thank you. My God. What's going on, Doc? What? No way. He's reading L‘Equipe! This takes the biscuit! It's a miracle. It's out of control. Call the media, call the Pope! Enough. I'm just trying to get into it a bit. Laurent, I just got your results. What does it say? That I can start competing again? You have to start chemo again ASAP. I've called a local hospital. They're waiting. I've always hated hospitals. Mind you, who likes them? Apart from doctors? Eh, Doc? I'll be back in a minute. - It's Laurent Fignon. - Hello. Hello. Hello. - Thanks for seeing us. - No problem. Well? What's it like working with God every day? Meaning? The legendary Dr Chevalier. Stressful? When God is your boss, you're not allowed to complain. OK. Call me when you're ﬁnished. How I lost the Giro d‘|ta|ia? How they stole it, you mean! I'll tell you. Because of the wind. - The wind? - Yes, madam. After cancelling the biggest mountain stage, after trying to undermine me in every way, what did they do? - Send a helicopter. - No! I'm not joking, madam. A helicopter. The big guns. No hesitation. Mark my words, the wind is the rider's greatest enemy. - Wind? - Yes. I see the helicopter in front of me. I'm on my bike. I'm pedalling away. There's a wind nailing me to the spot. Nothing I can do. I'm going nowhere. It's no use! Stuck. Blocked. Terrible! Why all that? So that their guy, Moser, an Eyetie, could ﬁnally win a Giro. I wasn't happy, with that thing up there. I was shouting: "Vaffanculo!" "Vaffanculo!" And you know what? That's how I lost. Fortunately, I got my revenge a few years later. And the 8 seconds? Ah. The 8 seconds... That's another story. Mr Fignon, shall we go. Yes, but give us a moment! 8 seconds won't matter. Please, Mr Fignon. Ladies and gentlemen, my high-performance medicine awaits! Unfortunately, it's true. Can I ask you a question, Doc? Yes. ls this happening because I took stuff? Stuff? Yes. Stuff... Stuff to go faster. Ah, that. What did you take? You'd like to know, eh? What with all the stories about doping, sorcerers' apprentices, all that. You're talking about it, not me. You wanted to ask me, though. Well, I took... amphetamines. I got caught twice. Recovery drugs, when the pain was too intense, corticosteroids. That's all. Ah, yes... cocaine, one time, during the Tour of Colombia. - Are you making fun of me? - No. That stuff won't make you ill. You didn't take anything else? EPO. transfusions? That rubbish? That came later, at the end of my career. I never touched that. OK. Shall we start? Go on, then. I'm glad you're here, Baba. What? It's beautiful! Don't take it badly. It's good! Who's it by? Rilke. Ah! What team does he ride for? That's crazy! Stop, Baba. Crazy! It was here, eh, Baba? It was here. Yes. It was here, boss. I ended my career right here. I'd maybe done, what... 350,000 km on a bike? Eh? The distance to the moon. I'd never taken the time to look around, except on that day. It's wonderful. I was looking at that tree, there, I braked, I disengaged my feet... and tore off my number. Cycling was over for me. Finished. What fun we had. Eh, Baba? *Bagnéres-de-Luchon 1P5“ *Co| du Tourmalet *Salies-de-Béarn Hello, Valérie. You OK? Fine. - Are you sure? - Fine. It's just... There are times... where I just go to pieces. And Laurent? He's been a live wire all morning. It's the cortisone. He must rest today. I know. I know. Where is he? As he had some free time, he went to the village. Sorry. Hey there! Hi, Doctor. How are you? Oh. Stop that, Johnny. Here. Archives from 1989. Thanks, Hugo. Know where Laurent is? Over there in the cycle shop. Cycles Raoul, the beautiful bike specialist 4 km from the ﬁnish, I switched to 44-16. - Do you remember? - Of course I remember! Oh! Doc! Look what I've found. Incredible. Look. 2 bikes I used in the past. Crazy, eh? The real ones. I got them at an auction 20 years ago. Crazy. How could we ride on these things? It weighed 4 kg more than today's bikes. - Easily. - Hey! Look what I did: drilled holes in the chain ring to save weight. Crazy, eh? Why don't we go for a ride? What, Laurent, with your low blood pressure? - And tomorrow, we're... - Stuff tomorrow! I mean a little ride, not the Tourmalet. You know what? We'll have a race. If you win, I'll do everything you say. If you win, I suppose I have to shut up? Exactly. I may be ill, but I'll win. Then you'll stop bothering me with consultations and check-ups. Trust me, Doc. I feel much better. I'm on top form today. I can feel something inside, like a ﬂame, hope. I always liked that Emerson quote: "Hitch your wagon to a star." You know Emerson, don't you? What team does he ride for? It's not my time yet, Doc. I'm barely out of childhood. He)', Fignon! Leave riders alone instead of criticising them! You used to be a pain when you were racing, now you bug us with your commentary and we have to tolerate your cancer. Have you no shame? Know what? You always were a bastard. Now, you're disgusting, too. You're so right, sir. We must get rid of all these cancer sufferers. Then they'd stop bothering us. We could put them in camps and wait for them to croak peacefully. What's more, we could get rid of alcoholics at the same time! Fat idiot alcoholics really piss me off! I don't believe it! When you've ﬁnished... I'm not going with you. OK, then. I'll go cycling on my own, with my low blood pressure. Laurent... Yes? *Co| du Croc du Loup Alright, mate? Not too hard for you? Different from jogging, eh? Hey! What are you doing? Stop it! I can manage by myselﬂ Change gear. You'll be knackered. I'm already knackered. *8% Col du Croc du Loup l--- - You OK? - Fine! Get away from me, Doctor. I'm ill. You didn't think you'd beat me? What have you gained? You leaving me be. That's the deal. You think I'll let you kill yourself? I don't give a fuck. It's my life. I'll do what I want. I'm sick of your treatments, the palliative care, bloody radiation treatments. I'm not a laboratory mouse. Your loved ones, fans, me... don't we deserve respect? Respect? You talk to me about respect, but you want to shut me up in a room to give me, what, an extra 6 months? A year? ls that respect? If you respected me, you'd tell me I had no hope of getting better. You'd have told me straight. Eh, Dr Clavel? You don't give a shit about what happens to me. You're only here for one reason. Because Chevalier clapped her hands. You're following orders. For your career, matey. Piss off! Get out of my sight. Leave me alone. Go away. Go home! Leave me alone. Thanks for coming. - Were you in mid-ceremony? - I wasn't far away. 100 km. My son-in-law's from Bordeaux. How is he? His blood pressure was very low. Nearly a disaster. Come. I'll buy you a coffee. - How are you bearing up? - OK. I've got a confession. I was head doctor on the Tour. That's how I met him. Really? Yes. We love cycling in my family. I'd have done anything to be on the Tour. So, I experienced the 1989 ﬁnish from the inside. Do you know about it? 1989. The 8 seconds. - Sore neck? - It's nothing. I'm tired. I'll tell you a little story. 4 years after that, I was in a car with Laurent in Paris. We had a meeting in the 17th arrondissement, I think. Anyway, the quickest vyay was to go via the Champs-Elysées. When he heard that, he yelled: "Anywhere but the Champs!" So I turned off. We hit a traffic jam. Of course, we missed our meeting. What I'm trying to say, is... all his life, he's held his head high, no matter what happened, except that day. He broke down in public and he never got over it. You know, I chose you to look after him for a reason. Excuse me? I know you're planning to go and work in a lab. Don't make that face. As boss, I know what's going on. You'd be making the biggest mistake of your life. I don't understand. Few doctors would have got this far with Laurent. Most would have left by now. I didn't manage to get him to go to Paris for treatment. You listened to him. You questioned yourself when necessary. You kicked his butt when he deserved it, and gave him the strength he needed. You're a good doctor. I'm allowed to say that. I'm still your boss. Ah, shit. I must go. They're going to kill me. The Wedding's tomorrow morning. Thank you. This is terrible. Fignon is behind by 30 seconds. Fignon may lose the Tour de France. - It's unbelievable. - LeMond is so quick. Extraordinary. Greg LeMond will retake the yellow jersey in this ﬁnal. An historic moment in this Tour de France. Laurent's in a bad way. It's an off-day. He's on the descent. One last chance to save the day. Laurent on the attack. The suspense is unbelievable. 30 seconds, now. 28 seconds, 27, 26, 25. He must cross the line within 25 seconds. In 20 seconds. He'll lose the Tour if he's not there in 20 seconds. Attention! 10 seconds left. 9, 8, 7, 6... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... That's it! Laurent Fignon has lost the 1989 Tour de France. Greg LeMond wins. Greg on the inset courtesy of Pierre Badel. It's over. Laurent Fignon has lost the Tour de France. How emotional. Jean-Paul, go and see him. He's lying on the Champs-Elysées. What a terrible scene. Laurent's sitting. He's shattered. He's experiencing the most awful moments of his career, and we're with him. He was the winner this morning. 50 seconds ahead. He lost everything: nobody wants to ﬁnish the Tour 2nd. We share Laurent Fignon‘s sorrow. Are you OK? Have you cheated on me often? I'll never tell you. I love you, Valérie. - Hello. - Hello, Doctor. I'll be back. How do you feel? Never been better. I didn't think you'd be back after my outburst yesterday. - What's that? - EPO. You taking the piss or what? I told you I never took that. I'm not going to start now. We give it to chemo patients to get them through an ordeal. Trust me for once, mate. And, believe me, there's no anti-doping inspector in the commentator's booth. You called me "mate"? Listen carefully, mate. I decide from now on. Tonight, we'll go out and have fun. OK? Stop. It's scary: you're like me. Mr Rigid will take care of things. You're my guests. Good stuff! Milesa. Brasil! Thank you. How did you know about Brazil? I let the cat out of the bag. Obrigado. Thank you. I'm very touched. A la vida para siempre. You must take me there. It's pretty, apparently. Pretty isn't the right word. Pretty is pretentious. Out there, it's wonderful, it's sublime. If I'm taking you on a honeymoon, it has to be exceptional. - Isn't that right, Doc? - Yes. At least! Thanks. Princess, may I have the pleasure of this dance? Can I pay now? It's ﬁne. Mr Fignon paid it. You'll see. We'll be happy on the island. Happy. You'll see. We'll make love. We'll make the sweetest love. For as long as possible. For as long as possible. Your EPO‘s working. I may get a taste for it. I have something for you, mate. 'Surprise! For me? You'll be able to tell your boy one day. Thanks, Laurent. Be careful, though. It's not an exercise bike. As you can see, the sun is shining again, almost a symbol of this Tour de France. Today, Saturday: the penultimate stage. A time trial, gentlemen, with an evocative name. A 52-km time trial between Bordeaux and Pauillac. I can't resist it. - Cheers, Jean-Paul. - Cheers. Cheers, Laurent. Cheers, Thierry. As always, gentlemen, moderation. Firstly, no surprises as to today's winner. It was, of course, the Swiss rider, Fabian Cancellara, and no surprise as to the overall winner of this 2010 Tour de France tomorrow: the Spaniard, Alberto Contador. Laurent, it will be his 3rd victory in a Tour de France. Yes. 3 victories. He'll have done better than me. I won it twice. But it's well deserved, given the effort he has put in during this Tour. - It's good. - Nicely put. Right. Well. Dear Jean-Paul, dear Laurent, before this 19th stage ends, I'd like to take a moment to thank you for these 3 weeks together. And a very big thank you to you, Laurent, for being a wonderful consultant, as usual, for your love of cycling: it's important. And thank you for giving us all a lesson in life, because whatever happens, and I say this from the bottom of my heart, your place is here, with us. That's really kind of you. I don't know what to say. I'm really happy to be here with you because it does me good to watch the cycling with you, Jean-Paul, and with you, Thierry. You know, when I discovered I had this illness, I called you, and straightaway, you said: "No problem. We'll do whatever you want. "We'll adapt." Well, I must tell you that it really touched me to know that I wasn't alone and that I could do this Tour, because... it's moving for me to see the Tour de France and... And we'll see you again at the World Championships in September, and next year on the Tour. Forgive me. I didn't want... Don't worry. It's natural. Don't worry. OK, boss? Fine, Baba. You hear that, Doc? Laurent Fignon died 3 weeks after the Tour ended. He was 50 years old. *L‘Yvette To Laurent... Subtitles: Eclair Group
