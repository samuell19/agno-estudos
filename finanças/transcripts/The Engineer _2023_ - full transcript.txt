You know, they're all here for you. I don't care. You don't? What about presents? Do you care about presents? A little. What about... cake? There's a cake? Yeah. Of course there's a cake. Chocolate? Mm... I don't know. - Then I don't care. - I mean, it could be chocolate. Your mother knows how much you love chocolate. She also knows how much I hate parties. Look where we are. Why don't you just come with me? We'll go, we'll see what the cake situation is. No. Everyone always messes up my hair, they pinch my cheeks. It's annoying. Well, I-I promise to protect you. No one will even get close enough for a handshake. They'll come close, I'll-- take out the gun on 'em right there. Get out! Get! How many presents did you see? Enough that I can call it a pile. - It's that big? - Yeah! - Really? - You ready? - Yeah. - All right. Come on. Hey, Adam! Happy birthday. Thanks, man. - Hey--! - Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! - What? - You don't have any authorization. Oh, and how do I get authorization? - Cake. - Cake? Yeah. Huh. What flavor? Chocolate. Chocolate. Huh. I'll see what I can do. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Adam ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ It was him. Yeah. Norit, I'm sorry for interrupting your party like this. It was already interrupted. Are you here to take Etan back? You suspended him for doing his job, - but now look what happened. - Norit, please. Go inside. Can we talk in private, please? Yeah. Come on in. She's right, you know. The streets are getting covered in body parts, and we're sitting on our hands. Well, that's why I'm here. Prime Minister called. He asked me to put all hands on deck, especially yours. So, you need me now. I need you to follow orders. I don't follow orders? You beat a man within an inch of his life, Etan. He was gonna talk. He was gonna die. Look. There were Americans on the bus. We really don't want them involved. After what happened, you really think the guys are gonna want the American back on the team? American? You moved here when you were 16, you served in the Israeli Army. You're Israeli. Believe it or not, that's not how they see it. Well, that's the way we see it. How many dead? Twenty. A lot more hurt. Where are the guys? Waiting for orders. All right. I'm gonna go back inside. Hey, Etan... I need you. Israel needs you. Well, right now, my son needs me. - What happened? - Pack your bags. You're goin' to Marseille to stay with your sister. I'm not going anywhere. No, it-it isn't safe for you here, Norit. It's not safe. This is my home, Etan! This is our home. Listen, the bombings are getting closer. The next one could be right outside our door, or worse. I'm not running. Are you? They're taking me back. - Listen... - Good. No, good. They were stupid to let you go in the first place. If anything were to happen to you or Adam... No... listen to me. - Remember who you married. Hmm? - I know. So, if we want our proposal to make any kind of impact, it's gonna need money and elbow grease. And luckily, I'm prepared to give a lot of both. What is it? Are you all right, Senator? Excuse me. Excuse me. You better give me more than that, please. Yeah, but how do you know? Can-can you just bear with me for a second, okay? Um, are you sure that she was on the-- on the bus? She's been identified? No, I'm gonna get involved in this. No, don't tell me I can't! Don't tell me. What'd they say, sir? Are they bringing her home? I need you to call someone. Anyone. Who? Call Avi. Call him. Call Avi. We can't come back from this. I'm very sorry for your loss, David. I'm sorry for your loss. - Really. - Thank you. How are you liking your new job, Avi? Keepin' you outta trouble? "Like" may be a little bit of a stretch, but it's, uh, it's work. Avi... I need a favor. I strongly suggest you take a moment and choose your next words very carefully, David. I want you to find out who did this to my daughter. That's all? Information? And I want them dead. There it is. No, no, no, no. Look... the minute you stepped on American soil, you were on the government's watchlist. Okay. Old friends became new problems. And when you got mixed up with all that bullshit, there was no one to help you get out. No one. Okay? You'd be rotting in some prison or a shallow grave, - if it wasn't for what I did. - I know... what I owe you. Made some bad choices, David. We all have. And those choices left a lot of dead bodies. Like I said... we all have. You remember her, don't you? Yeah... I do, I do. What do you need? Money. I gotta go get a team together, and the guys I have in mind, they don't come cheap. I hate having to ask you this. Please believe that. We'll find him, David. I promise. Give me all your money and your watch! Avi! - It's really you? - It's really me. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? I just came to visit you! What am I doing here? Good to see you. Good to see you! Good to see you. Love the... scruffy look. Yeah. It's crazy to see the streets of Tel Aviv like this, huh? The work, it sucks right now. There was another bombing eight days ago. People are afraid to leave their homes. And that's why you're here. You're interested? I thought driving a cab would be a nice change, you know? I don't get into any gunfights driving people to their homes. Now... there's no real difference between walking through a war zone and driving into one. Is that a yes? What do you need? Not much. Is he here? No... no. Fuck. All right. Let's go. All right... you ready for this? What?! Uh-- Fuck! Okay, let's go again. Come on. Nah. Last one! Nah, had enough. - Anything? - Nothing. Yakov said to sit tight. Yeah, Yakov said a lot of things. Who is it?! Pizza! We nearly killed you. What are you doin' here? Getting back to work. Yakov authorized it? Yakov ordered it. Then why didn't he tell us you were coming? I think he just wanted to savor that sweet surprise. Surprise? It's not the best time for surprises, Etan. Hey. I know. I know, okay? What do we have? His wife's house, just like you suggested before... well, before you left. - The wife's house, huh? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, he still hasn't showed, though. Oh, he'll show. So, what do we do, just sit? Yeah, for now. Just... - get a little time to think. - Yeah, take your time. It's not like there's a, uh, lunatic out there blowing up Israelis. Do you have a problem, Tamas? Well, as a matter of fact, I do have a big problem. But he's standing right in front of me! Eli, make some coffee. Let's bring Etan back to speed, and then we can talk about plans. But for now, put your dicks away and let's get to work! Yallah. The sun will kill you. I should be so lucky. Can we go somewhere to talk? Somewhere with shade? I'm listening. The Engineer. Who else is coming? Hi, Gili. Let me think about it over lunch. You're buying. Noah! You've grown, huh? Do you remember me? Does-does he speak English? What? Yeah, I speak English. The other question. Can I take this to go? No. Go order some food. Avi's paying. Of course. - Well, good to see you, Avi. Thanks for lunch. - Good to see you. Okay. Bye, Abba. Bye, Noah. Bye. Bye, Noah. Looks like his mother, huh? Looks like your neighbor. We need equipment. Weapons? Of course, weapons. And clothes too. And we need a new ride. We're crossing the border. It's good to see you, Avi. It really is. But I have to ask you... why? Not going to find him in Tel Aviv. I mean, why you? Why us? Getting paid. What do you care? It's the money that's concerning me. It's not enough? Actually, it might be too much. That's what's bothering me. The old man has a point. Someone I know... with money and influence... his daughter was on the bus in Dizengoff. Wait, so he's using his money and influence to get revenge? That someone... American? Senator Adler. So, why isn't America sending someone? - They sent me. - Off the books. Are you guys having second thoughts? Second, third... Okay, in or out. Yallah. I'll find him myself if I have to. I can get us a car, and we can be over the border by tonight. I have a contact in the Mista'arvim. If anyone knows what's going on in Gaza, it's them. Okay, we can't be noisy. No one has to know we're there. Like ghosts. That's comforting. Gotta do one more thing. What? To pray? I'll be back. Wait a second. Stay here. Is this how you say hello to all your guests? - What do you want? - You look great. What do you want? I didn't come here for trouble, so, uh-- You shouldn't have come here at all. Is she home from school? - No. - She-- hey... Dad? - Dad? - Hey, Suka. What are you doing here? He was just leaving. - Can you stay? - No. You need to do your homework. Can you come back tomorrow? Yeah... I'll come back tomorrow. Go to your room. Hey... can I get a kiss? I missed you. See you later, beautiful. She's gotten so big. You're lucky she even remembers you. Don't make any more promises you can't keep, Avi. You're gonna break her heart again. And if by some miracle you do come back tomorrow... don't sneak up on us. I'm sorry. I don't care. Tel Aviv yesterday. After the bomb went off, people ran to the scene to try to help. Next slide, please. Among them was a second bomber, who set off a bomb while the rescue efforts were going on. Next slide. Twenty dead. A third bomb was found a couple blocks away, probably for a third bomber. Okay. Shut it off. Yakov, I have the Prime Minister on the phone. Put him on the phone. Hello? I understand. I'll have some answers for you at the end of the week, sir. Thank you. Guys... all hands on deck. I need you guys to go to work. Get this fucker, let's go! Abdel Nasser Issa. One of our informants has confirmed that he's not only fabricating bombs in an apartment in Nablus, but he's also running an entire cell from there. His building is here. But our intel is showing a half dozen surrounding structures, containing cell members or some type of sympathizers. Okay, so you're saying, if we get spotted, we're gonna have the entire neighborhood on our balls. Well, our balls. There's only one way out of there, and that's down this street. And how do we get him? He's gotta come to us. Huh, why would he do that? I intercepted a call. He's meeting with one of his men tomorrow night. Here. Zero exposure. We wait for him to show. And we take him. Why are they meeting? I didn't pick up any details. Hmm... then there's only one way to find out. Good luck. - Salam alaikum, Gadi. - Ah! 'Ahlan, habibi, keefak. What's the intel you gotta tell me? Engineer is fucking hero in these street. Any mention of him followed by nothing but praise. The Shabak is leading the hunt. Shabak are chasing their tails. Hey-hey, we're all on the same team! Okay, so yallah, Gadi. Give us a name. Let us help. Yallah. Shouldn't cross path with any Shabak interference there. He'll-- Gadi, we can't send them there. You have guns? Yeah. We have. Yallah. - Good. You'll need them. - Thanks. - Yislamo, habibi. Shukran. - Ah. I didn't realize how bad an idea this was until right now. Smugglers make my balls itch. How's your Arabic? Shukran. Who are you? We are here to see Khader. I know the why, but I still don't know the who. Business. Business... What kind of business? Our business. Not yours. Want to hear a joke? We, uh, rather just wait. Yeah, shukran. You don't like jokes, huh? Khader isn't coming, is he? No. You like jokes? I love jokes. My friend here has a really good one. Let's hear it. Oh. Yeah, that one. Mm. It's a very good one. - Yallah. - It's to die for. Where are they, Fanni? They left a while ago. You should have visual soon. - I got nothing. You? - Negative. I think I see something. Okay, here we go. We have a vehicle. Is it him? Okay, you guys, listen. We have to take them now. We've got a vehicle, but I've-- we've got no confirmation. We need confirmation, Etan. Okay, target confirmed. Target confirmed. Repositioning. Get your hands on the fucking ground! Hands on the fucking ground! Fanni? Get the room ready. Secured. Yallah. Hello? Peace be upon you, my son. Peace be upon you, Father. How are you, Ayyash? Tired. Allah's work is not easy, my son. How is your family doing? I do Allah's work for them. So they will be strong too. You must be strong as well. I will. I am only a phone call away. Thank you, Father. And Allah is with you always. I love you. - I know. - Salam alaikum, my son. Goodbye. Just got off the phone with the Prime Minister. We are not to use any force in this interrogation. - What?! - My hands are tied on this one. There's no time, sir! There's nothing I can do. He's setting up for a peace rally. The last thing he needs is the word to get out that they're torturing suspects. This guy is not gonna crack with words. Figure it out, Etan. There's nothing I can do. My hands are tied, okay? Do not, and I mean do not... use any force on this. Call me when you're done. You know what? Take his, uh, take his hood off. Yeah. Take his cuffs off too. You, uh, you want a cigarette? Tamas, give him a cigarette. He could probably use one. I am not telling you anything. Whoa... did I ask you to tell me anything? That's why we're here. You want information. That's the only reason I am alive. The only reason you're alive is that man standing right there, Mr. Tamas. We know who you are, we know what you've done, and we know what you've been doing in that apartment. The question we need you to answer now is... "Who are you doin' it for?" For Allah. Hmm. Of course. Allah rejoices in the killing of innocent people. There's no such thing as an innocent Jew. As for Allah, he demands justice. And so do his people. Where is Yehiya Ayyash? I'm sorry, who's that? The Engineer. Where is he? You tell us where he is, and we will-- You'll what? Let me go? We will take your testimony into careful consideration when deciding your sentence. Only Allah can judge me. We need to push harder. Then push. Well, my hands are tied. You heard what Yakov said. I don't mean with your fists. I don't know if I can do that, just 'cause I don't think he's gonna crack. We have no choice, remember? You know... you're the first person I've interrogated for almost three months. I'm honored. Y'know, the last man I interrogated, I almost killed. He was there. I just-I let my emotions get the better of me. And when I realized that he was not only not gonna to tell me what I wanted to know, but that he wasn't gonna tell me anything... I hit him. And then I hit him again, and I hit him again. And then I figured, I'd already fucking hit him, so I might as well just keep hitting him. Until he was... barely recognizable as a man. I mean, the guy looked like a Frankenstein. It was really horrific. He never talked. I've replayed that day for three months since then on constant loop, you know? Imagining different questions, different answers, different outcomes. And the only thing that really keeps me up at night? I should've killed that fuckin' guy. I won't make the same mistake twice. You don't scare me. I'm not tryin' to scare you. Honestly, I'm just... tryin' to prepare you. I am already prepared to die. We'll see about that. - What did he say? - Nothing yet, sir. - So, what do we do now? - Now, we wait. - Leave him with his thoughts for a while, then-- - We don't have time to wait. Listen, I'm telling you, sir, this guy knows what we need to know. And unfortunately, there's only one way of getting it out of him. Etan... you know it's not up to me, it's up to the Prime Minister. If it was up to me, I'd let you off your leash. You know that! My hands are tied. Are we clear? Go back inside, figure out what you can get! What? Do you think it's hopeless? No. I think there's still some hope. I spoke to some of our neighbors today. They won't even step foot in the city anymore. Everyone's just waiting for the next explosions. It's scary. The only break I get from the news is when Adam watches his cartoons. We're gonna catch him. What, you don't believe me? Hmm? I hope you catch this guy... and get back to us, okay? Avi! What the fuck? What the fuck you doin' here? What--? - Huh? - Get in. - What are you doin' here?! - Inside, inside. Are you out of your fucking mind? Huh? What are you doin' here? Came to check on your progress. You could've called. Well, I want to be here when you find him. You understand? Any luck? Not yet. I don't know how you two got here, but, uh, I suggest you use the same means to go to Tel Aviv... where the sight of two Americans won't be as, uh, complicated if you get caught. I understand what you're saying and appreciate it, but we're not in Gaza, are we? - Oh, in Gaza. - I've made my decision. I want you to bring the man responsible to me. I want to look him in the eyes, and I want to shoot him myself. And I promise you, we will find him. - Right? - Mm-hmm. He's gonna pay for whatever he's done. For what he did. What don't you understand?! Get your asses out of here. - Gili... - The old man is right. They're gonna get killed out here, or worse, get us killed. Look. They want to stay, they're gonna stay. If you don't care about your life, fine. But coming here right now, this is insane. But you bringing him? You're not only endangering his life, but you're risking my life and theirs. You are not only in a different country, you're in a completely fucking different world, filled with people that have lost a lot more than-- With all due respect, gentlemen, I was in Vietnam when your asses were still getting wiped by your parents. All right? I'm well aware of the dangers. Vietnam. Do you have a little orange juice or something? - Yeah, we have water in the fridge. - Water in the fridge. - Henry, please... - If someone-- listen, listen. If the phone rings, don't answer. If there's a knock on the door, don't-- just don't fuckin' breathe. Goddamnit. News in Jerusalem. We were told that a-a bomb exploded on board a bus. Uh, seems to be a bit of conflicting information as to whether or not there was a bomb on board a bus or nearby a telephone pole. Uh, but bear this in mind: when all the news of Libya... ...was crossing about five days ago, - Hamas fired several rockets into southern Israel. - Hello? - Yes, sir. - The Israelis, in turn, responded. - Perhaps this is retaliation for that. - Thank you, sir. - Uh, as we sort through all the information... - Okay. ...we're getting right now, Reena Ninan's by telephone. You're in Jerusalem, Reena. What have you found out about this? - What's goin' on? - Bill, this explosion... Another bombing in Jerusalem, five minutes ago. That's the main bus hub, right at the entrance of Jerusalem... Good news is, you've got the green light. You can push harder now. They don't believe it was a suicide bomber-- How did Alina look? Angry. She looked beautiful. If you want it, it will happen. Oh, yeah. That's our target. Khader Tarik Kassim. That's good. Hey... - Is he there? - - Khader's address is 2563 Kadesh Road. Bye. Let's go. Take the key. Don't fucking move. Khader Tarik Kassim? Levi, bring me a chair. He went to your children's room. Hm? When I ring this bell... ...he will slit their throats. One ring, one child. After two rings... ...he's gonna go to your room. Where's the Engineer? Hey... You smuggle for him. Yes? He doesn't know. Changes places every time. But there's someone who doesn't change his place. Who? Meen? Love makes us make stupid things, - but there's a rumor. - What rumor? Hey! Hey! What rumor? His wife, she's pregnant. Is he really that stupid? Khader. Good. Yallah... Let's go. You wanna talk? Why don't you just talk, hm? Talk! School friend... a child is coming... the martyrs, they don't... the martyrs, they... they don't... You gotta start making sense or I'm gonna start breaking bones. Okay? Do you want to fucking die?! Huh? You don't think I'll fucking do it?! Where is Ayyash?! Where is Ayyash?! Where is Ayyash?! C'mon! - Right now, tell us! Tell us what we wanna know! I delivered a device to my operative. A vest. - A bomb. - Yes... with instructions to choose a bus at random. Okay. Who gave you the instructions? Ayyash. The Engineer? Yes. He teaches others how to do it, how to make bombs. Teaching where? Where is he? He doesn't know. What do you mean, "He doesn't know?" Of course he knows. Keep goin'. If I keep going, he's gonna end up telling us that he is Ayyash. He doesn't know. And? Did he crack? Crack? Looks like he fucking exploded. We're back to square nothing. He's teaching them how to make bombs. Well, that's something. Right? No, without a "where," it's nothing. He said someone's pregnant. You mean, when he was half-conscious? Do we still have eyes on the wife's house? The wife's house has been really quiet. No way he's going back there. The only thing he cares about is there. Hello? How are you doing, my jewel? I'm feeling pregnant. And alone. Look out your window. Do you see the moon? Yes, I see the moon. Looking right now at the same moon. I'm close, and we will be together soon. We will always be with you. You know that. I love you. I love you. You came back. And I told you I would. Mom said you're not staying long. There's, um... I have to do this... thing. Is this "thing" related to the attacks? You shouldn't be worried about any of that stuff. You're a kid. I'm 13. Oh. And the most beautiful 13-year-old girl in the whole wide world. You've been gone a long time. Did your mom tell you? Mom doesn't lie to me. What did she tell you? That you got into trouble at work, that you pissed off the wrong people, and that a US Senator had to step in to clean up your mess. I guess that we were part of that mess, too. No, no, no. You were never part of any mess. I needed you to be safe. I needed you to be here. I know. You know that I love you. I know... I know. His heart is in the right place. His heart's gonna get him killed. Just shake the hands, you have peace. If only it were that easy, huh? I don't trust this guy. We have to. Hey. Where'd you go? I went to see them. I told you they're safe. By doing what you did, you're-you're ensuring the opposite. David, please... I wanted to say goodbye. If you don't get him alive... I want proof. - You want proof of what? - Proof that you got him. Look around you. This is a regular Tuesday for us. Look. ...recited by Jews daily... This country's ready to blow up on its own. I have to know, Avi. Keep watching the news. You'll know. Call. Well... the problem is we're playing cards when we should be playing chess. Fold. There's no strategy involved in these attacks. The targets are random. The bombs may be sophisticated, but we're dealing with a madman. So, how do we stop him? We need to think like madmen. No, we must become madmen. - C'mon. Fuck! - Please. - We got a visitor! - What? Is it him? Who is it? I couldn't tell. - Do you get eyes on the back door? - No. We gotta get out there. We gotta get eyes on him. Come on, guys! Hey. - I've missed you. - Oh! Get down! Down, down, down! Where is he?! Where's Ayyash? I'm gonna check in the back! - Eli, what do you got? You got anything back there? - Nothing. All right. Let's go to the back. Tamas... you go that way. Eli, you go that way. Okay. Get back to the safehouse. He knows we're tracking him. He's gonna go straight into the shadows now. Fuck! Fucking rat. Guys, something's happening. What is it, Fanni? She's got visitors. Maybe they're moving her. We were just there. All right. We're gonna head back there right now. - What happened? - - Surveillance cameras all around. - Shabak. - Fuck. - Probably. - Yeah. - Where have you been? - Yeah? Right here. You went to the redhead again? Fanni, we're on their tail. We're following them. What happened? - What's goin' on? - I need a moment to think. If they're watching the wife, she's a dead end. How do you know? 'Cause they would've had him already. Ugh, if she's pregnant, he'd at least be calling there, right? Yeah. The kid's right. She has to know something. Okay, we can do a sweep in the morning, see if they have any blind spots. We gotta find a way into the house. Down, down, down, down! Everybody get the fuck down! Okay, okay, okay! Gili... they're with us. How are you, Etan? It's fucking Avi? Is this fucking necessary? Huh? You tell me. We're on the same side. Are we? We're losing time. What do you think I'm doing here? Again, you tell me. Tell me what you're doin' here, Avi. Right outside Gaza with a US Senator? Are you out of your fucking mind? His daughter was on the bus in Dizengoff. If-if I could... Permit me for a second now... My name is Senator David Adler. And, uh... as he said, my daughter was on the bus when this... uh, gentleman... Anyway... I engaged Avi... to, uh, to get that son of a bitch. He asked me if I could do something. Asked you? Now, what did you think you could do? Ayyash's wife. She's pregnant again. You're tellin' me Yehia Ayyash-- the Engineer's wife, is pregnant? Exactly. How? If we have to explain to you how babies are made, then we'll have to spend here all day. We have the house under constant surveillance. Well, maybe he found a way to get into his house and into his wife without you knowing. Maybe they're meeting somewhere else. She knows where he is. Maybe, but she won't talk, and there are some lines even I won't cross. Eli, take the senator and his man back to headquarters with Fanni. I would appreciate if you did not, uh, involve any other authority. I'm here under my own jurisdiction, no government instruction. Right now, I'd appreciate it if you stopped talking. We're gonna take you back to Tel Aviv where we are gonna decide what to do with you. - Do you understand? - Yeah. Okay. So, let's take him to the airport. As far as I'm concerned, you both owe me. He's right, David. Go home. It's safer there. Well, now we're gonna get out of this room and onto the street, find any informants we can, shake 'em down, see what falls out. What about them? Well, they're gonna help us now. Right, Avi? Etan... we're real close. Good. I hope you're right. Tamas, uncuff 'em. Let's get the fuck outta here. Truly shocking news from the Middle East tonight. Israel's prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, has been assassinated. An evening spent dreaming of peace turns into a national nightmare. The assassin has taken yet another world leader away from us. It was just after the biggest peace rally in Tel Aviv... Prime Minister Rabin wanted peace most of all. As do I, as do all of you. But the change that needs to be made is not an easy one. There will be more blood. There will be more war. But we will bring about change. And we'll attain it. I truly believe this. This "engineer..." I don't want you to capture him. This man is a symbol. With every bomb goes off, a message is sent to our people that their safety cannot be guaranteed, their lives cannot be protected. Well, it's time to send a message of our own. Yes, sir. Hamas is a snake with many heads. We cut off these heads, and the beast will fall! I hope it's in your liking. You will have complete privacy here. And if you need anything, anything, just ask me and I will bring for you. I like it. Osama... what I need is your discretion. Of course. And a phone. Okay. I will bring for you. Your phone. Okay. You need anything? Osama... - Thank you. - It's pleasure. Yallah. Salam alaikum. Wa alaikum assalam. This tenant was so crazy, asking all of this weird stuff. Wow, what a stressy week. Osama? Nephew, what is it? What are you so stressed about? A tenant, he is requesting a phone. What tenant? I can't say. Okay, okay, I will say. But I need your discretion, Uncle. Osama, is it a girl again? No, no. It's an old classmate. - And he pays? - Yes. Tayyib, it doesn't matter. A classmate, not classmate, a boy, a girl. But why are you so stressed? It's him. Who's him? What him? The Engineer. It's him. Ayyash? I told you. We were in the same class. You're certain it's him? Tayyib. It has to be here somewhere. You're turning the place upside down for a hunch? It's all we have left, okay? Look, we need to rethink this. Issa wasn't lying about Ayyash's wife being pregnant. - So? - So, he mentioned a school friend, okay? There has to be a connection. You gave him fucking brain damage. All right? We've been over everything. His schoolmates either seem to be dead or better off dead. What about this guy, Osama? He was at least in the same class as Ayyash. Look who his uncle is. Okay. It was a good hunch. Taking our keffiyahs, armed to the teeth. It's just like old times, huh? Yeah. You know, no bullshit? Our years in the Mossad were some of the best of my life. Maybe when we get home, when we're done, - get a few beers, grab the mangala. - Oh, maybe. It depends if your grilling has improved or not, though. Appreciate you... letting us join the fight. This is all our fight, brother. Yeah. Hello, Kamal. Don't fucking move. What do you want? Information. I don't have any! I have rooms, if you want. I have five available. You're very popular, Kamal. I have my reputation. How many wives do you got, Kamal? Please... I know nothing. But perhaps if you can give me something... I can give you something. What do you want? Money? Israeli papers, for me and my wives? Why don't you start with telling us this "something" that you think you know, and we'll make sure that nobody knows that you're friends with the Shin Bet? W-we're not friends! Well, I mean, we can let your people decide what we are. And just think of what that will do to your reputation. Please. Y-you will have to promise me that nothing will happen for-for me or to my family! You'll be safe. Mm-hmm. You and your wives. He's here. You have to get us his phone. - What for? - Surveillance. Please, I don't want to cause him any harm. Not to him, not to my nephew, and not to myself. No, no. Okay, I will do this. But only this. Okay. Okay, great. Great. Avi! Tamas! Come on in here. Keep an eye on him. We plant a bomb in the phone. The next time he gets a call from his father, we detonate. We gotta confirm that it's him first. We'll get a sample of his voice beforehand. Etan, Fanni's on it. We'll get a confirmation of his voice, and I'll get back to you. Eli, Etan's bringing you a phone. You have about 45 minutes to put a bomb in it. Okay... Now... in order for us to make sure that we record him, you gotta make sure that he answers this phone and this phone only. Okay? Do you want me to cut the line of the phone in his apartment? Yeah, that's perfect. What happened to your room? I have lost it. What, your mind? My phone. It must be here somewhere. I have looked everywhere. It's hopeless. Look for it over there, maybe you will find it. It's hopeless. I have failed him. Ah! There it is. It was here on the floor. You saved me, Uncle. I'm forever in your debt. You're always in my debt. Who is it? Osama. - Salam alaikum. - Come in. I bring you your phone. Thank you, Osama. You okay? Yes. Alhamdullilah. Yallah. Salam alaikum. It would've been great to have some eyes inside the building, but we'll make do. So now, we wait. Fanni, we're here. Are you ready? Ready. It's him. Hello? How are you, my son? I apologize for calling you so early. Is everything okay? - It's him. - Everything is fine. Aiwa. I miss you, my son. It's him. Must've been very scary. Do it. Do you want to tell me about it? Didn't work. It didn't work. What do you mean, "didn't work"? I-I-I don't understand. Let's just go in and take him out, Avi. We need to get that phone back. What happened, Eli? I'm not sure. It could have been anything. Um, I-I can tell you once we get our hands on it. Do it. Fuck! How do we get it back? We can't risk the uncle getting caught. I have an idea. So let's see if Kamal can take Osama on a helicopter ride. Cell phones are not allowed on helicopters. We do not want to go into his location. Eli's right. We need to bring it back. Okay, so we get it back. - We better get it back. - We get it back! Fuck! Let's do it. Let's do it! Yallah, Gili. I'm sorry, guys. - Salam alaikum. - Wa alaikum as-salam. - Mr. Hamad? - Aiwa. Please, come in. Welcome. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Wonderful. Um, please, grab something to eat. Thanks. Perhaps when we return? Because, uh, helicopters and full stomachs don't go really well together. Oh, yes, yes. And, uh, your nephew? Is he still coming? Eh, yes. Just a second. Osama! Etan, here's the plan. They're on the way to the heliport. You stay close. Eli, you go to the airport, grab the phone. You're gonna have about a half an hour. Um, I'm sorry, but no electronics allowed in a helicopter. I need your phones. You'll get it back when we return. Don't worry. And your phone. Yes, Fanni? We have someone leaving the house. I cannot get an ID. This could be anyone. All right, let's get a closer look. - Finally. - C'mon, let's go. Step on it. Yallah, yallah! Is it him? It's not him... It's not him. Hey, let's get outta here. C'mon, c'mon. Thanks. Right. There it is. Be very careful with it, though, okay? Easy. Slowly. Slowly, yeah. Hello. Fanni, what's going on? Where is everyone? We thought we saw Ayyash. Etan and the others went after him. - Was it him? - No, sir. - Wasn't him, wasn't him. - I know, I know, I know! Okay, where is everyone? They're heading back to the apartment building. Wow, wow, wow... Yes! You enjoyed it, nephew? - This was amazing. Yes! - Yes? - It's ringing. - Okay. It's ringing. - One day, if you work hard as me-- One moment. Hello? Ayyash? Okay, okay. I must go. Fanni, get the Senator on the phone. - Hello? - Listen, Senator. Hold on. Stay with us. Who is it? Osama. - Hello? - Yes, father. I hope inshallah to see you soon, my son. I know, father. More nightmares? We lost him. I don't have confirmation. Do you have eyes on him? We don't. I don't know if he's still on the phone. Etan, I need a visual before he disappears on us. This'd be the last time we get him. All right, we should be able to get a clear view of that room from the roof over there. And keep the engine running. Just like old times. All right, go, go, go, go! Okay. I'm goin' up. I'll stay here. All right. How is the kids? Yes, father. No sign of him yet. I don't think he's moving. I know, father. I know. It's him. It's him, it's the Engineer! Do it. Hello? Hello? Hello! Hello, ya Ayyash! Let's get the fuck out of here. Fuck! Gili... Etan, what's the status? We lost Gili. Oh, fuck. Sara... Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck, oh, fuck. Fuck! Oh, fuck. We lost Avi as well. Oh, fuck... oh, fuck... oh, fuck! Oh, fuck... oh, fuck! Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck. That's it. Senator... It's done. It's over. - Hmm. - - We lost two good men. - Was one of them Avi? - Yeah. Thank you.
