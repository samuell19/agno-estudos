Inspired by the life and career of Pierre Durand and his horse JAPPELOUP - The Ride to Victory Summer 1974 number 19. Medical aid required at obstacle 12. 19, that's Pierre! Serge, that's Pierre! You all right? Sure? Let's go. Pierre, get off that horse. - He has to get back on. - Get down! Mom, I'll get eliminated. Relax, six obstacles left! This is his last cross-country race. - He's fine. - Fixed obstacles are too dangerous! Let him jump bars! At least they'll break, not him. You hear me? You're so annoying. A local wine grower comes to Town Hall with the idea of creating a riding school on his farm. Now I'm asking him to join us. A big hand for Mr. Serge Durand, and the Saint-Seurin Riding School! I do want thank the Mayor for his enthusiastic participation in creating this riding school. I also... It's for my granddaughter. Since her parents passed away, nothing interests her. But she loves horses. I told her we could breed them. No more than one foal a year. Where would you put them? - The Jappeloup meadows. - Jappeloup? But what about your cows? I don't know, we'll see. How are you? Know what? I'll drive. Otherwise it'll take forever. Hey, champ. Time to get up. Hey, gypsies! You've been told not to camp here. What's up, kids? Mr. Durand. Hi, kid. Good luck. Lighten up, you know him. I sure do. He's as dumb as his father. Wait till you ride in Rome. That'll shut those rich boys up. I haven't been selected yet. D'Orgeix will see you ride this weekend. Believe me. You'll see what happens. Okay, we've seen him jump. Get off now. One more! Shit. That's enough. You'll hurl yourself. He won’t jump, fine. He jumped the other day. And you fell, too! If you fall ten times for each jump! Put him inside. You won't sell him? I don't know, hon. For now, I'll find a rider who can rein him in a bit. You're too nice to him. Arlene, Serge. I'm interrupting. Don't be silly, we're done. - You well? - And you? I said come later, when he naps. I didn't get that. How are you? - Coffee? - Love some. I need a favour, Serge. My wife? Take her! I'm fed up with her. Not your wife. A friend asked me for a favour, so I'm asking you. I'm all ears. He sure can kick. Lots of energy! You can say that again. This is his first trip, so... I was going to keep him for Raphaëlle. But he's too much trouble. She's out of her depth. But... he sure can jump. Seeing how your son did in the Nationals, maybe he could watch him jump, and maybe even enter him in competitions for young horses. Yes, I know. Francis told me, but I can't promise. Pierre's problem is, his diplomas went to his head. Now he wants to be a lawyer. Oh shit. And he's obsessed with girls. Warm him up. Pierre will be right here. Who knows what he's doing. If I told him about you, he'd throw a fit. Let's go, come on. Cédric, saddle Laudanum, bring him out. - Here's Pierre. - Hi. How are you? This is Mr. Dalio. He brought us a promising horse. Oh yeah? Hi Francis. A trotter? Got trotter's blood. He's crossed with a thoroughbred. Not a show jumper. - How old? - Four. Pint-size. He's tiny. Not much balance. Have him jump a bar, see what he can do. No time, Dad. One hour for Laudanum, then I go back to Bordeaux, and work. Sorry, Mr. Dalio. Bring him back in a year, when he's fully grown. Well I want to see him jump. Would you bring him to this cross rail, at a trot? You all right? Francis, take him? Easy. - Does it hurt? - I'm fine. Come on. Never saw anything like it. No way to show a horse! Dirty, out of shape. Like a club horse. Setup some bars? - He's not warmed up yet! - Sure he is. Put a little vertical up? International Jumping Competition Poland 1978 - I'll do it in five strides. - Are you sure? The one time I come along! This was my last competition. Jean-Marie was scared, too. Mostly for his horse. He might've been hurt, too. He says it's all about managing time. - Jean-Marie? - Yes. We told you. You can't do this as a hobby. You're slipping. And now look. This is something else. I fell because he went off a stride too early. I'm so tired right now. Exactly. And that's fine. You can't do law school and this. You must choose. Telling me to quit? No. I want... I want you to feel free to do what you really want. If you want to stop competing, I'd understand. You don't realize. It's hard for me. Why? Because Dad... You've been by my side for years. I see how happy it makes you. I don't dare quit. You sank your money into the stables, the truck. I wanted to do you proud. Wouldn't I be proud if you're a lawyer? Forget the money we spent. It was for us, too. If you're not happy on your horse, quit. You could still ride. He won't have Laudanum. It's true, I could never quit completely. Once I get my career on track, I could still enter the occasional competition. That's what I mean. Don't worry about us. You're free to live your life. I'll ask the doctor what time he'll let you out. How should I handle you? See? That wasn't so hard. 2 years later Great! I trust Pierre to take it from here. Goodbye, see you soon. Hey Ruben, how was it? Not great. I'm glad you came. You couldn't make lunch? No. I got to bed late. Remember Mr. Dalia? You quit jumping? According to your parents. No, I don't have time. The other day, you said you missed it. Yeah, sure. I do. The atmosphere, friends... It is hard. But I wasn't meant to compete forever. Other priorities. Excuse me. Pierre, look. - Recognize him? - No. His horse, Jappeloup. The one you wouldn't ride two years ago. He remembers the rider better than the horse. - Why? Who is she? - Nadia. They rode together in the Juniors. I didn't recognize her. See that jump? Didn't grow much. Sun tiny. Nadia Devilder on Jappeloup withdraws from the competition. Still... Be right back. Had trouble with your pony? How's the lawyer doing? - Been awhile. - Yeah. What's going on? No more Grand Prix horse. Now I ride young horses. Like some you won't even look at. Wasn't in good shape when I saw him. Doesn't look like much now. Really? You never could pick horses. Or girls. The files you requested. Hi, you called me? What's up? Bored with Bordeaux girls? Home, princess. Thanks a lot. You okay? Can you make it to Bordeaux? No, actually. I thought maybe... You bastard! No, it's all right. Relax, I get it. I can stay at my parents'. They'll like that. On the other hand, if you want me to stay, I'll bring them croissants tomorrow. No. Next time you won't be so drunk. Nadia, you can't! Stop! Nadia! 'Morning, how are you? Fine. I'll tell your dad you're up. Leave him be. If I don't tell him he'll throw a fit. Pierre's awake! So what was it I forgot to say? Damnit. It'll come back to me. Oh, right! - What? - Nothing. It's always the same. You ask questions, but don't listen to my answers. You keep repeating you forgot what to say. You're always in a hurry. So I try to remember stuff. I wanted to say, I'm buying that horse, Jappeloup, the five-year-old we saw. Dalio has no rider for him. Nadia gave him back. I heard yesterday. Dalio told you? No, Nadia. Really? She gave up on him. Sure about this? It's on a trial basis. Who'll ride him? Gilles. Really? Well, all right. I have to be in court. Did you sign with François? Next week. We're as good as partners. Good, I'm proud of you. Mom? You'll tell her. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Let's go. Come on. Let me. Come on, boy. If my dad saw me ride here, he'd kill me. Why? It hurt him when I quit. He lived for it. Driving me, watching me ride. If he's not well, it's my fault. Are you kidding me? Nonsense! No, I'm serious. It drives him crazy that I left. I thought of going back to competition. For him. So he can see me ride, one last time. So why don't you? I don't know. Show me if you can still jump bars. Great. A little higher? If you like. Enough for now? Yeah, that was great. Thanks! Feels good. You still got it. He can't do a thing. Did my dad have him jump? Coming to the vertical. Well? Well? What do you think? He can jump, but he needs work! He needs shearing. He can't work like this. We tried. He won't let us. Not even with the twitch. He rips his blankets, chews his bandages. I should be in Bordeaux now. We'll talk at lunchtime. Go ahead. What are you staring at? Get lost! Okay, call him. Take him? The blacksmith had trouble, too. Not surprised. I said you should call me. Calm down. Go ahead. Gently. Listen. Want to work here? Take care of him? Then you're hired. Stan with this. The curb bit, I'll show you. This comes third. Then the last one. He's too feisty. The Filet Baucher bit now. That's no good. There, that's better. We'll see how that goes. Okay, I'm going. You must help us. A problem with our neighbours. WOLF & DURAND Attorneys-At-Law How can you ask him to take off there, Marina? You nuts? Be right there. Through the turn. Build momentum. - Where's Nadia? - Trying out a horse. She said not to wait. How are you? Seen your horse? I have others for sale. No, thanks. Too much work. We'll buy this one, then we'll see. Okay, to Jappeloup! Not sad? So long as I'm with him. You better win. Okay, boss. How'd the other one do? - 37.8. - Better speed up. ...Two, three, four, five, six! Damn, that horse has heart! No. He's got more than that. With 37.06 seconds, the leader in this round and winner of the Lille Grand Prix Cup. - Good? - Yeah! Thank you for coming back to the Hares de Jardy Cup... Go, hurry. We got this. Well? - Eighth. Two bars in the jump-off. - Shit. No, get out! I won't look. I'm really late! So am I. Did you do well? No, two bars! I hope your day gets better. March 1982 Gorgeous. What muscles. Does he like your legs, too? Stop rubbing, you'll wear him out. Marcel Rozier called you. What?! You didn't call me? - He was in a hurry. - And? Selection camp for Team France. I said you were busy. - Good? - You kidding? He said to call him. So stupid! Relax, you did your best. He's watched me for a week, not a word. Let him form an opinion. Nations Cup Raphaëlle, don't forget to do it. He's dirty. You're on. Jean-Marc can't ride. Mador refused twice in practice. Too risky. You have an hour to get ready. Okay? First jump with Team France, Jappeloup, ridden by his owner Pierre Durand. Number 5 on your program. In the stands, actor Jean Rochefort. Shit, he started. No bell, no time. What should we do? Durand is eliminated for starting before the bell. I heard it ring! It was a total mess! It was so noisy, I... You are eliminated. Please leave the arena. I crossed the line! Please! Asshole! Stop! Stop it, you'll hurl yourself! You look like an idiot. Everyone can hear. I don't give a shit! Didn't I just look like an idiot? In front of millions of people! Leave me alone! Second fault, 8 points, for Gerd Wiltfang, who took that obstacle a little too fast. Listen carefully. This can't happen again. I've followed you for months, done all I could for your success. My life's on hold - I hardly ride anymore. I'm happy to do that for you. But not so you'll dump me in the truck with your dad, all because you missed the bell. Do you get what I'm saying? I'll leave you 15 minutes to think all this over. Then come to the bar, apologize, and buy me a drink. Frédéric, serve instead of flirting. Want a breather? No, I'm good. Did he call you? Are you going to ask every day? Call him. He's a coach, he's busy. Why? He doesn't care. Media's right. You can't enter a seven-year-old in the Nations Cup. Too young. You're not up to it either. Marcel knows it's his fault. So he won't call. He doesn't give a shit about me. Don't you get that? He wants to destroy me and take Jappeloup. Don't be paranoid. You just don't get along. You promised we wouldn't argue. You started by sulking. Hope you like your meat well done, you'll love this! It is well done. Thank you all once again, for coming out for these three days. You have been a wonderful audience and I hope you'll all stay and cheer for this second jump-off, French Championship Finals, 1982. This round is a race against the clock. A! the bell, the walk-through will give the riders a chance to evaluate the course. I'll be back to announce our winners. Serge, stay with me. - Think so? - Leave him alone. Well guys, as you know, it's a tough course. What's he up to now? All right... Mr. Caillot, designer, please tell us about your course. The field has lots of rises and drops, to test a horse's balance, making for very delicate approaches. A lot of finesse is required. How high are the jumps? Verticals up to 5'7", oxers 5'10" and 6'1" wide... Our last contestant. This pair has been the revelation of this event. Not one single fault in this championship! The event's current leader, everyone's talking about this little horse, a phenomenon. Join me in welcoming Pierre Durand and Jappeloup! Come on. The open water jump. Why's he taking so many chances? One fault, he still wins. Win with a fault? You don't know your son's pride. Your mother's in the car! I'll get her. Champagne! Nice, right? Yeah. But why a hatchback? I won it. I couldn't say, "No, not a hatchback." And this is for you. I got a tow bar. You can tow the van to meets. I'm not going anymore. What? I wanted to tell you. I've decided to quit riding. Completely. Even here. But why? I think it's best. Best? Why is it best? Just for nine months. Then I'll ride. Grandma, start knitting. Rumours from the U.S. say there are killer combinations and obstacles. Your reaction? You said it, they're rumours. Please. That hasn't been confirmed. But anyway, we've worked hard. Riders and horses are ready to confront arduous courses. Mr. Durand, you apparently had trouble getting selected. Your fall in Hickstead was Jappeloup's second refusal, with Longchamp a month before. Should Team France and its coach be worried? You can ask the coach, he's here. As for Hickstead, your information is correct, but it was a practice run. I had a clear round the next day, helping France to finish second in the Nations Cup. Would you have let Jappeloup enter without you? That was certain people's wish. It was settled quickly, because owner's approval is required. And as I am Jappeloup's owner, I decide who rides him. Was a million dollars offered for Jappeloup? Is that true? Jappeloup is not for sale. For that price, I'd throw in the saddle! You got eliminated in Paris when you didn't start in the minute after the bell. This is the third straight year it's happened. Isn't it laughable now? Think so? Then laugh. - No hostility intended. - There never is! That's so French. You praise me when I'm champ, then tear me down. There are five of us. You question me 45 minutes. Getting hard to take. Calm down, all is well. More questions? Mr. Rozier, was selecting your son, Philippe, a little premature, with his spotty results? - Some speak of favouritism. - You know what? If I hadn't selected him, you'd ask why! You always want din. Please, wait! We have more questions! Los Angeles Olympics, 1984 24h before the competition That's good. Eric! He'll have me jump last. Or not at all. When do we have to clear off? In 20 minutes. The Italians are next. They won't leave us extra time. Yesterday they came five minutes early. Pierre, Hubert! To the vertical. No way. - We'll warm up first. - We haven't got time! The Italians are coming. Look, it's Graziano. Hurry up! Marcel, we wanted to talk to you yesterday. We've jumped enormous fences all week. We need individual training, tailored to each horse. Eric wants to work water jumps, Pierre, his combinations. But you won't listen. Our last day, you start jumps with 15 minutes left. It's not your role to speak for the others. - You've been messing us up. - What? Always acting like an idiot! You're backup. So don't whip up trouble to get even! Marcel, we make up our own minds. Your horse is what got you here. I just keep you from screwing up on him! Quit that now. You were a great horseman, but the worst coach I know. Can't you see he's hard to ride? No rider could get him over these jumps! You say build momentum, you're wrong! How can I be confident, with all you dish out? You realize how you speak to us?! We want to jump lower, what the hell do you care?! Lower? Here. Jump that! You figure it out! Concentrate on what you know, on what you feel is right. Don't get hung up on all that. Tomorrow, ride like you've been riding. Change nothing. Don't listen to him, okay? All right. It's past 11, you need rest. Your dad and I will bring good vibes tomorrow. I love you. Memo. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Patrick Caron, what's incredible is just how small Jappeloup really is. Next to the other horses here, it's striking. Jappeloup is 15.3 hands, and that's very small. Just compare him with Touch of Class, the American .Joe Fargis' horse, a major favourite in these games. But he jumps very high. He really stretches it out. Think he really has a chance? Jappeloup has what it takes. All the talk about this pair's youth. Pierre Durand's inexperience. Wasn't selecting him risky? Look, I think they're both young, but they show promise. They didn't get here by accident. They should do well. In any case, I wish them luck. That's what you say! Idiotic journalists. Look at that beautiful horse. You realize he was born here? Tell Arlette it's Pierre's turn! Arlene, he's up! Sure you won't come and watch? Yes, I'm sure! What are you doing? Peeling potatoes. Calms me down! Coming out of it, yes! Last one lined up... It's done! Fargis with a perfect round. Masterful horsemanship. Patrick? Love watching him. All finesse. Everyone picked this pair and now, with a clear round, the U.S. team clinches gold. You can hear this crowd going wild. But France is expecting a lot from our last pair. Here they are! Jappeloup and Pierre Durand, walking down toward the arena. Fred got 12 points. Sorry to pressure you. A clear round would get us bronze. Everything we said was bullshit. What counts is what happens now. If I thought you didn't have what it takes, you wouldn't be here. Forget I'm an asshole. Do your stuff. Careful on this one, almost fell there in the first. Yes, perfect! This horse has great reach. Great effort. Hope he's not hurt... He's so generous he wears himself out. It's a long course, Pierre knows it. He's giving his horse a breather. This horse usually runs very tight and very compact. Like stretching a rubber band. Come back. What's he doing? Going easy on him. Imagine how disappointed the French are. Durand's fall has just dashed all hope of a bronze medal. Elimination of Pierre Durand and Jappeloup. France moves to sixth place. Shove your gold medal up your ass! - Where is he? - He went that way. The illusions are over... Well... I'm accepting the Americans' offer. I'm selling him. I always liked the idea that our lives are our own. That we can change them, at will. Make a radical life change, with a decision made in a flash. I always wondered how I'd do if I went back to riding. Well now I know. It was a big mistake. These last two years were a big mistake? The progress you made with that horse? The joy you brought us all, especially your father? You started out doing this for him. And this? Was this a big mistake? Does nothing make you happy? Do you realize how selfish you've become? You haven't slept in two months, so neither have I. Don't I get to rest a little? - You're disappointed... - Disappointed! Do you know what it's like to be humiliated by the press? Everyone turning their backs on you, the coach saying only I kept him from winning. Think that's easy? I messed up my whole life. I skipped adolescence. Only the competitions mattered. One day I decide to quit. To have a normal life. To experience something else. And I jump back into the shit! Know what? Enough. If living with me is being in the shit... - I didn't say that. - You did! Without realizing. Do what you want, but don't ruin both our lives. Want to quit? Quit! Forget Jappeloup is a unique horse, who got you to the Olympics! And he caused your fall, yes. But before the eighth fence, he jumped seven in legendary fashion! With uncommon generosity. And you? You sell him to the first bidder from the U.S.? Is that the father of my child? A guy with no fight left in him? Don't you want to train? To get better? Not happy in this life? Then sell him. Go back to work. Give me a chance to see you smile. Let me get some sleep. - Saddle Jap? - No! What? I said no. I can't keep you from selling Jappeloup but I won't help you do it! I'm leaving. Raphaëlle! Gilles, seen my dad? Not in the paddock? Dad! In here! - What are you doing there? - Get in. Remember us two eating here? Talking about your next show or your latest. All that time we spent here. Don't just stand there. Remember why we did it all? Because we liked it. Don't start I'm just asking a question. Because we liked it. And now? Why did you do all this? For me? That's why you resent me so much? I don't resent you. You've been sulking for two years. If I enjoy seeing you ride, it riles you. Why are you punishing me? For trying to make you happy? Like Rozier, you think I'm spoiled? You are a spoiled brat! We built our lives around you. Worked to give you all this. The stables, the farm. This horse you now want to sell. I closed the vineyard to make this work. See? I knew you'd throw that in my face one day. Now you see why I couldn't quit? Why? We never blamed you for quitting. It hurt a little, but that's over. You want to quit, quit. But don't blame it all on me, don't make me responsible for your comeback. It made you sick not to ride. You just won't admit that. Maybe you did it for me. But it was also for you. Anyway, I hope it was for you, because otherwise... what a shame. With your current mindset, you won't progress. You can accuse me or your coach. You won't get anywhere. It was your fault you fell in L.A. Not Jappeloup's. You need work to ride at that level. If you're not happy in your work, quit. Just get some perspective before you decide. Take a few days' vacation. Don't decide to sell Jappeloup on a whim. Dad, $400,000. It's huge, it's the chance of a lifetime. I'm having a kid, I have no job. I need money. I'm 30 and I still live at my parents'. - I can't be just a rider. - That's not true. You're too proud to accept defeat or humiliation, like in Los Angeles. As champion of France, no problem being just a rider. So yes, you have a choice. Between the life of a bourgeois lawyer, loaded with money, or that of a rider working hard towards gold in Seoul. That's always been your dream. It was your dream, so it became mine. So... stop turning the tables please. You decide, it's up to you. I don't want to ride at that level anymore. We can't keep a $400,000 horse in a stall doing nothing. Do what you want, what you feel. Your mom and I have no regrets. We acted out of love for you. Become a drag queen, I'll still love you. You have nothing to prove, I know you love me too. What are you doing? Taking a little nap. At noon? Yeah, right. You can come out, they're gone. When the baby's born, we could bring Jappeloup here. Before he leaves, he'd like it. When do you send him? When we get all his papers. We might have time. Might be tight with the baby. Forget it. What? Nothing. Don't flap your arms. Eyes straight ahead. Good. Now back around. Back around. Straight with the left hand. Jump this. Do it right, we'll go higher. No, stop! Stop, stop! I'll lower the rail. Honey, call room service... Hello. You've reached Saint-Seurin Stables. Please leave a message after the tone. Oh, sorry! Do that again and I'll deck you! I'll deck you! Sorry. We still have to go fast. Breathe, breathe. Push. Not yet, it's too early. She's not dilated enough. - Okay. Then don't push. - Shut up! Stop it! Does it hurt? How does it feel? - Sorry. - No, that's only natural. You rest. I have an important errand. Back in three minutes. Can I make a quick phone call? Yes, follow me. Hi. I have good news. I didn't sell Jappeloup. I'm in training again. So I need you back. That's great news for you. Not for Jappeloup. He might've gotten someone good in the U.S. This has been a rough time for me. I know. I'm very sorry about your dad. He was a nice guy. Was I mean? You just don't get it. You were champion of France, but you know nothing about horses. You talk of medals, dollars, careers. Ever think about him? He's an animal. We sold him to you for peanuts. Asking only that you take care of him. In two years, you never spent two minutes in his stall. All you do is climb on his back. He needs your trust, you need his. That's why he stops. What if I want to learn? To get closer to him? Will you help? Yes, but first I need to calm down. What did you think? Told you she's got gypsy blood. January 1985 Go ahead. European Championship Germany 1985 right turn and into the bounce. Between 4 and 5 you have six strides. Nice and easy going in. I know, see you. - All good? - Yeah. - Put his bonnet on? - Lots of gnats. Well, Jap? Ready to win? Put up a double at the oxer, please? Yeah, I'll set it up. Give me a hand with the vertical. Not too high, just to gauge it. Don't worry. Wait! Don't wear him out! Shit. Get the vet, quick! Walk him around. Only 10 minutes. I'll play for time. You all right? Did Raphaëlle go for the vet? Give us a break. - Answer me! Did she go? - Yeah! Have him trot again, please? No fractures or torn ligaments. He'll be sore and bruised, but... Amazing. He's a tough one. And the next rounds? Tomorrow should be fine. He might be very stiff now. Try a jump and see. We'll quit now. I won't let him get hurt. Europe is over for us. We're going home. Mr. Durand, last warning before elimination. What's going on? Know what he just told me? Rozier got the distance wrong on that double. What? Are you sure? Sure. I counted it off right after you left. A horse of his calibre making that stupid mistake! 9 meters - too short for two strides. Unbelievable. All that work on him not stopping! We could've died! He didn't do it on purpose. Not on purpose. He wasn't concentrating... Mistake or not, it's unforgivable! The European Championship! I've had enough! He's a great horseman, won lots of prizes. But if he stays coach, I quit. Hear what he told the press today? With the federations president. We lack team spirit. We live in the sponsors' tents, drinking. I'm sick of looking feckless! We should tell the press we're fed up with Rozier. I'll get him! Like I said. Can't say a word. Talk to him. Our horses belong to the federation. It's our necks. We talk, we're grounded. He owns his horse. That changes everything. I'll talk to him. So tell me, Mr. Durand, why do you need a sponsor? Because I need money to live off my sport. That's why sponsors exist. Why us? All the other brands said no. Francis thought Remy Martin might be interested. We both felt, an equestrian pair and a wine grower, both from Bordeaux... But... what's your current status? I asked around. You're no longer with Team France. I did leave the team about two months ago. Why? Human reasons. I couldn't work with their coach. But I'm not alone. We hope next season another coach will be named. What about your horse's illness, that cost you the U.S. sale? You're misinformed. I wanted to cancel. He has piroplasmosis, but he could live with that. We're treating him now, but we didn't have to. Maybe we should talk about their recent results and media exposure? Right. Do you have a press pack or something? I have it right here. I've kept it since '82. So that's Jappeloup? Nice looking horse. You won't let me ask my parents? I still have the job offer at the auctioneer's. Lisa, open your mouth. Look at me. It's a bad time. If you were on the team, winning, that would be different. In good times, I wouldn't need them. Pierre! I'm going. See you tonight. What is it? Who was that? Marcel resigned. That was Patrick Caron, the new coach. He wants me back on the team. We're back. World Cup Barcelona, Spain 1986 Pierre is last. Turns up the pressure. Watch the bounce. After the vertical, five strides. Short! How did we ever sleep in here? Impossible! Guys... Eyes closed. Concentrate on your breathing. Focus on the belly. Now each runs the course in his mind. Obstacle by obstacle. With the number of strides we decided on. Try to visualize every possible option. And... there. Nice! We're tied with the Brits. It's a jump-off for the bronze. Stay on, I'm sending you in. Look out, the Brits put Whitaker up. Milton has longer strides, he's faster. No, my options make it up. Whitaker will take options too. Not these. Wait, how do you approach the open water? The vertical sideways, cut in at the oxer, then the water. Not enough momentum. A stride and a half. The rest fine, but not that. Touch the water, it's a fault. If I make it, that's my edge. And I'll make it. Forget the water option. No one's done it. It's impossible. Just watch. Don't risk it... He's going for it! He did it! I'm leading in all three qualifying rounds. Yes, first of 73 pairs from 15 countries. Do you realize? Top in the world. For now. Tomorrow is the revolving round. That's when you find out who the best rider is. Mom, I have to get some rest. Give Lisa a kiss for us? Love you. What's got into you? Come here. I'll show you the world's best pair. Look at Mommy. Is it winning that gets you hot? Sleep well? No, not really. I don't like lending my horse. It's such a stupid rule. You work a horse for years to be the best pair, then they separate you. That's world championships. It's to find the best rider. Not the world's best pair. Here, look at this. I saw her yesterday. I was short in the turn. Okay, it's not over. Come on, Pierre. The worst pan is, maybe they're right. My horse is great, I'm not. Quit your bullshit. She knows nothing about Jappeloup. She climbs on, she's perfect. Skelton, too. You're disappointed, but riders do make clear rounds. She deserved to win. I agree, she was great. I just... wonder if I deserve this horse. It's not like you've had no success. Are you kidding me? This weekend, four clear rounds. No one ever did that. This year you won Amsterdam, Rome, Hickstead. Hey! In six Grand Prix, ten clear rounds! Two months from the Games, you can't quit. Look! Over there! Shit! - Look! - Pull over! Turn it off! Get out! - Come on! - It's burning! Get in the back! Hurry up! Pull! Wait, Pierre! Hang on. Easy. It's all right now. Seoul Olympic Games September 171988 In Seoul, a nod to Maurice Chevalier for this 1988 Olympiad. For the French team, straw boaters! A total of 170 delegations on parade for the world's largest show. 70,000 in the stands, over a billion TV viewers. Hold it. I'm going. You're right. Time for bed. Individual trial tomorrow. Daddy, it's only 11. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Buddy... Amazing. No one here. Seen the time? There'll be more for the second round. No traction. Better calk them. How's it looking, Pierre? I'm going for a clear round. Forget the clock. With these heights and distances, won't be many clear rounds. Two spotless rounds, you're gold. It's gold or nothing. That was great. A quarter point, who cares? Pierre Durand and Jappeloup, France, a quarter point penalty for overtime. You were great. No big deal. You did your best. Disappointed? Sure, but it's okay. The second-to-last, the oxer. They all hit it, thinking about the width. Come at it like a vertical. Get some pace in the curve and clear that first rail. Okay. Anything else? Trust yourself. Set up an oxer for me? Our second-to-last contestant, the German Karsten Huck on Nepomuck, 4 points in the firs! round. His horse is a little raw. More about that later. Keep your eye on Karsten Huck. Hit one! Made it. Made it. Four more obstacles for Karsten Huck. Goddamn Yanks. Shit! He's German. Same difference! Jappeloup and Pierre Durand. Obviously, with a clear round, he's a shoe-in for the gold. Don't stop, Jap. I beg you, don't stop. René! Give me a shot! I won't make it. The stockade. Seventh obstacle. Only two left. Last obstacle. Pierre Durand, Olympic champion! We will hear the Marseillaise. You won. After Seoul, Pierre and his horse went on to many victories. Jappeloup retired in 1991. A national tribute to him took place under the Eiffel Tower. He spent the last years of his life on the Saint-Seurin farm, where it all started...
