No! LOSING FACE Fanny Morane, 70, a Bergerane celebrity, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison. Fanny Morane burned down Mr. Novenski's office. Novenski, who had seized Morane's property, died in the fire along with his wife. The verdict comes as a result of the indictment of prosecutor Berthier, whose success is legendary. Any comments, Mr. Georgelet? The mitigating circumstances in this case weren't taken into account. It seems the jury didn't listen to my plea. However, as soon as the prosecutor opened his mouth, the court heeded him, without a trace of reserve. If Berthier had asked for my client to be lapidated, the jury would have rushed to get some stones. There's Berthier! Another successful case, sir. You were the one who put the rapist of Bergeran behind bars. Could this victory boost your career? Will you seek a transfer to a larger jurisdiction? Do you know how old Morane will be when released? The word 'victory' seems inappropriate. Justice prevailed. I merely defended the interests of the Prosecution. Do all these achievements make you feel proud? Absolutely not. I defend this country and its citizens. Regarding Morane, she'll be 82 years old upon release, but she won't spend 12 years in prison. She will be released earlier, probably in 8 or 9 years. I have no further comment. Thank you very much. Mr. Prosecutor... Have you watched Morane's movies? I saw an old film of hers. I wonder if it was a silent movie. That prosecutor's pretty relentless. I mean, poor lady. He's efficient, that's for sure. I couldn't sleep anymore with that rapist on the loose. I'm glad he put him behind bars. Damn, hide away. - What's wrong? - It's Guillaume. - Are you sure? - I'm positive. We'll use the back door. Alright. Why don't you try talking to him? Something's off about him. I'm sick of him. If he keeps stalking me like this, I'll go to the police. OK, let's go. Yes, madam. I'll tell him and I'll call you back. Thank you. Congratulations, Paul. You were incredible. The jury didn't look too convinced. I almost started to doubt, but then you got your way with them. It was outstanding. Thank you, Ms. Deputy Prosecutor. Charente FM would like you to go to their morning radio show. Definitely not. The case is closed, I've done my job. There's nothing to be said. I exit the stage, whether people cheer me or boo me. Is it always sunny over here? Clearly, you didn't grew up here. Wait till winter comes... Tell me about winter here. Don't you think it's too soon to talk weather? - Come on, give me a kiss. - Yes. Inside page? Don't you think it deserves better? Tomorrow, when people read this, Charente FM will have said everything. We're always behind. When your dad founded this paper, there was no TV or radio. You have to adapt. OK. Inside page it is. But I want a front page picture. - Fanny Morane? - Not her. She's done for. I want the guy who sent her to jail. Berthier. She barely looked at her during the trial. The crime was the only thing he saw. Temporary insanity, you mean. There's nothing glorious about sending a 70-year-old to prison. Berthier doesn't care about glory. That guy is like Robespierre. He only cares about justice. What are your plans for today? No plans. This warrior needs to rest. Really? I'll let you sleep, then. - I might have a better idea. - I'm listening. Making love on the grass. I don't know. If the grass is high, why not? You're afraid someone will see you with me? No. I'm not afraid of anything. Bighead. Vauban Group Welcome, everyone. This is Philippe Braquefort from Regiotel, a company specialized in bringing TV to remote areas. Go ahead. Hello, everybody. Vauban told us about his project... Yes. Charente FM had a voice, and now, it could also have a face. However, television needs infrastructure, which require a bigger investment than a website or a radio station. Initially, you would need a budget of 4 million euros. We have gathered those 4 million euros. The Regional Council has offered their support and will give us an extra 3 million euros. That is very good news. You're going to need political support. The Vauban Group is no stranger to politics. Many council members, mayors and prefects are in debt with us. So, rest assured, a TV station in the midst of an election campaign, is like a gift to them. What is it, Laurence? It's your son. He wants to talk to you. Alright. Excuse me. What's the matter, Guillaume? What? No, not all policemen are assholes. Did you tell them who I was? Alright. Talk to captain Soriano. Soriano. That's right. I'll be right there. OK. Thank you, Laurence. I'm sorry. My son needs me. I'm going to have to leave you. Young people think they know it all, but as soon as a bigger dog barks, they call for daddy's help. I'll leave you with Mr. Braquefort, who will answer your questions. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. I'm like Bluebeard, you know. who murdered his wives and kept their corpses. In this case, she almost killed you. Yeah. You know me, Mr. Vauban. I'm always accommodating. - But your son has crossed the line. - Figuratively speaking? Yes and no. Driving under the influence, failure to present license and other ID documents, contempt, insults and threats to a public official... I've heard enough, Soriano. I'll make you a check for an institution. It's not that simple. We searched him before taking him to his cell, and we found this. Did you know Guillaume took drugs? Like many others. This isn't just for personal use. Guillaume doesn't have the skills to be a dealer. Who paid for his bike? The Yamaha 1900? It was a present from me. What about gas? That's a high-consumption bike. He's a kid. I give him some pocket money. He still has no job? I told him he could work at the station, from 11 PM to 2 AM. No audience, so no risks. At least, I know where he is. I'm a responsible father. Can you free him now? Of course. - Did you take your swim shorts? - Swim shorts? - We're going to the river. - I don't have any. Considering this town is relatively far from the ocean, I didn't pack my bathing suit, flip-flops, etc. It's time for me to take control, then. Alright. - Hello, sir. - Hello. - I'm looking swim shorts. - What kind of shorts? Just swim shorts. - We have several styles. - I can see that. But this isn't my style, at all. We have others over here. That's more sober. More like me. You're the court guy? I'm the prosecutor, yes. Your picture's everywhere. It's funny to have you at the boutique. No. This stripe here is... This is much better. If someone had trouble... If someone was constantly bothered my another person, would you take the case? I'll take this. Do you have it in my size? Thank you. - You don't want to answer? - Yes. I'm sorry. You mean harassment? - Something like that. - You're the interested party? - I didn't say that. - No, you didn't. Whether it is you or not, the problem's the same. The person must go to the police. Then, the complaint is referred to the Prosecutor. That would be you. I'm a lucky girl, then. Or the Deputy Prosecutor. How much is it? There. - Catoun is a very pretty girl. - Catoun? That's a cute name. Catoun Garrel, Miss Pineau des Charentes 2014-2015. Two years in a row? Is that legal? We should investigate. How is that possible? There are not enough pretty girls. - You should enter the contest. - Nonsense. Imagine if you were a runner-up. That'd be awful. - This looks like a nice place. - Yes. It's beautiful. Let me introduce you to Wet Stones Creek. Nice to meet you. I used to come here with my grandfather. He loved watching the birds catch fish. Want to come in the water? I'm not sure about these swim shorts, after all. You can swim naked. We're all alone. If I join you, it won't be for swimming purposes only. Careful. The water's cold. Come on, Paul. Come with me. Show me how you dive. - Is there a problem? - What are you doing? It's noon. You're supposed to be in bed. You force me to work. I don't force you to anything, my dear Guillaume. I mean... I help you make money so you can buy drugs. If your mother knew! May she rest in peace. - Leave her alone. - You're right. But remember that thanks to your slave-driver dad, you were able to keep your driver's license and your bike. Should I say 'thank you'? That would be a nice start. That's right, go. I wouldn't know what to give you as a present. I don't know what you like. I like theater, painting, literature... Nothing original. I'll buy you a book, then. What do you read, apart from law and crime novels where the murderer's killed? I have nothing against morality, as long as it's fiction. For instance, I've just finished a book where the main character is a hired killer who murders women abusers. She's hired by a wealthy old lady who is obsessed by justice. I like the idea of an old lady punishing what men consider normal. You're right. There are no minor crimes in the eyes of justice. There is law and non-law. That's it. There are also mitigating circumstances. You can't just ignore them. That's for the judges to assess and for the defense to plead. Mitigating circumstances are not under my jurisdiction. You don't believe in crimes of passion? Yes, but it's a totally different thing. Beliefs have nothing to do here. That's a romantic vision, and there's no romance in law. Is there a place for romance in your life? That depends on you. Really? It all rests on me. That's right. In a way, yes. What... No! No! Are you OK? Yes. I think... I think I had a nightmare. See those clouds? A storm is coming. We have to go. - Are you OK, Paul? - Yes. Are you sure? I didn't have time to get dressed. A storm can be deadly. I once saw a lightning. It was like a ball of fire. You're scared of storms! Come on, let's go. Calm down. We're going to help you. There are other people in this situation. The fire department is very busy. Over 150 calls reporting flooded basements. It's not our job to clean their mess. You're overreacting, sir. You'll find your daughter. She's gone missing many times. She always comes back. Have you checked the store? Maybe she went to see if everything was fine. She was supposed to be there till noon. It's dark and I still got no news. It's Saturday, it's almost 10 PM. Let Cinderella have some fun. - Her name is Catoun. - OK. Catoun. - How does she usually commute? - By bike. She probably got stuck in a flooded path, and is waiting. Waiting for what? For the path to clear up. She would have called. She has a wireless phone. A wireless phone? She probably has bad signal. Antennas are dead because of the storm. Go home, Marcelin. This is Paul Berthier. Call back later or leave a message after the tone. Thank you. Paul, it's me. You're not answering your cell phone. Where are you? Pick up the phone, please. You were behaving oddly. I'm worried. The police are trying to reach you regarding a missing girl. Catoun Garrel. I was probably asleep. The machine broke down, I don't know. That would make a nice gift. Hello, miss. Mr. Prosecutor. - Is that Catoun Garrel's father? - Yes. He won't go home. There you are! I need to speak to you. Captain Soriano's waiting for us. I won't take long. Meet me at the courthouse this afternoon. Second floor. No, I need to speak to you right now. It's about my daughter. Please, find her. I will pay you. Just tell me how much. My wife had a couple of things. I inherited them after she passed. So, how much? Missing people are not under my jurisdiction. Everybody says you're the best. - Don't leave me, Your Honor. - I'm a prosecutor. I don't care. Just find my Catoun. Let the police work. It's their job. You have to trust them. I only trust you. I'm not what you think. Mr. Prosecutor? Excuse me. Thank you. We went to the store to buy a pair of swim shorts. Was Catoun there? Yes, she was there. How was she? What do you mean? That's a weird question. Nice and professional. Yes, of course. No premonition that you'd be the last person to see her alive? You don't know that yet. Other clients probably entered the store where she worked. Yours was the last sales receipt of the day. Why do you say "the store where she worked"? I don't understand your question. You could've said "where she works". Why using the past tense? Yes, it's true. There's no reason to think she's dead. You'll find her, Captain. I'm sure you will. What did you do afterwards? Ms. Florian took me to the... Wet Stones Creek. It's a dangerous place. There are strong currents there that can sweep you away. If a person drowned there, their body would be found miles away. Hey, Jean-Mi! Check this out! It's Catoun! Catoun Garrel! Jesus Christ, he found the girl! - Where is she? - Who? - Catoun. - What do I know? - You said... - I found her bike. I've seen it. She passes by everyday. Come and see. Did you find anything on that bike? The girl left it in the woods. But she loved that bike. It was her source of freedom. Is she afraid of someone? Did she run away or did she drown? The river squad is going to explore the area. That's good. What about the neighbors? They didn't say anything. However, we have Laura Chatelier's testimony. She's Catoun's co-worker at the Sportissimo store. She only pretends to be flirtatious. - Did Guillaume Vauban hit on her? - He stalks her. Catoun couldn't care less about him. - What kind of boy does she like? - No idea. Are you friends? Yes, but that doesn't mean we share every secret. She's very private. Did she and Guillaume go out together? To the movies, a couple of times, but that would be it. It couldn't last, and it didn't last. - She broke up with him? - Several times. - How did he react? - Badly. Meaning? He threatened her? That's what she said. What kind of threat? Death threat. It's just words. Young people don't see death like you old folks do. It's beautiful. That's G. Vauban. What else can you tell me about him? He's an idiot. A spoiled brat, an arrogant guy, full of himself. Classic. You never had to prosecute him? He's been arrested many times. He beat a taxi driver because he had looked at his girlfriend. - Catoun Garrel? - No. Some Mathilde girl. I think. He's always with a different girl. Although she said the driver hadn't bothered her, he ended up sending the guy to the hospital. - Did he press charges? - Yes. The charges were dropped right away. Why? His father intervened. I don't know what he said, but the driver dropped charges and even presented his apologies. There's no one else to put him in his place? His mother committed suicide. - Alcohol, depression... - I understand now. Wasn't Jacques de Groves the prosecutor at that time? That's why Guillaume never went to jail. You mean... De Groves and Vauban know each other. De Groves knew everything about Vauban's competitors, wiretapping sessions, planned police raids... He would warn Vauban, who would sidestep the attack or perfect his defense. What did De Groves have to gain in doing all that? He was named Prosecutor General at the Poitiers Court of Appeals thanks to a lobby campaign orchestrated by Charente FM. You know so many things. I'm impressed, you know? I want to kiss you really bad right now. Here? Or you'd rather return to the creek? Nice bike. - First time here? - Yes. It won't be the last one. Guillaume is a regular customer. - I don't have time for this. - We won't take long. Last time a cop said that, he left me in a cell for 36 hours. I'm working on my bike. The house is a mess. OK, fine. Come in. You never slept with the Garrel girl? No. Does that disappoint you? - She's cute, though. - Yes. - But oh, well. - "Oh, well"? She doesn't want me. Sounds like you're upset. I'm not upset, I just think it's very stupid. Where were you the day she disappeared? I got arrested by one of your buddies. That was the night of the 26th through the 27th. But you were released in the morning. What did you do then? I rode my bike through the fields. I wanted to forget. Any witnesses of that ride? - I have plenty. - OK. We're listening. My pleasure. There was a rabbit, three cows near Calvaire, a stray dog... You're seriously jerking us around. I'm telling you the truth, gentlemen. But you'll never change. If I don't do what you want, then I'm a liar and lock me in a cage that stinks of piss, shit and puke. Oh, dear... This world is a huge misunderstanding. Glass of whisky? As you can see, the prints we found seem to suggest that after leaving her bike, Catoun Garrel walked to the river. Seem to suggest? Of course. Further investigation is required - molding, etc. None of the prints indicate that Catoun took her bike again. However, to go back to town, she would've had to turn back. The creek is a dead end. Very well. And so your conclusion is...? I believe she fell in the river - either she threw herself or someone pushed her. The river squad hasn't found anything yet. Nothing yet. Maybe there's nothing to be found. Why are you so certain that the girl drowned? There are other ways to die. What makes you think she died? It's been ten days. Nobody has seen her. When a child is reported missing, the hypothesis of death is the most plausible one after 48 hours. Catoun Garrel's not a child anymore. Anyway, thank you, Langelin. I have a hearing to prepare. Call me if you find anything new. One more thing, sir. Captain Soriano told me that you had had a picnic on the same day and time that Ms. Garrel went missing, where the bike was found. Yes, that's correct. I was at the creek that day, with Ms. Florian. We were there from 12 AM to 3 PM, approximately. When Laura, her co-worker, arrived at Sportissimo to take over, Catoun had left a note saying she was vacating the premises at around 1 PM. It's a one-hour ride to get to the place where her bicycle was found. This means Catoun left her bike somewhere between 2 and 3 PM, at around 100 meters from the place you were. Then, she went to the creek. You didn't see or hear anything at all? Nothing at all. We also found blood on the grass, near the bike. Is it hers? The DNA tests confirm it. And quite evidently, it wasn't a simple scratch. Maybe a car hit her and she fell off her bicycle. I doubt it. Her bike has no signs of damage. It's an old bike, but it's her baby. If she was hurt, she could've asked you for help. Yes, but as I've already told you, I didn't hear or see anything. The river down there is quite noisy. If you don't believe me, you can ask my deputy. There's no reason to be offended, sir. Of course I believe you. But... Excuse me. Chief Officer Langelin. Yes? What? Where? Are you positive? Call Captain Soriano and the coroner. Captain. Mr. Prosecutor. I have to perform the autopsy, but one thing I can tell you is, I don't think drowning is the cause of death. - Why do you say that? - There's a head injury. A large, deep wound from where she lost blood and a fair amount of brain tissue. Maybe she got hurt while in the water. She could have bumped her head on the bottom. That's unlikely. I would have found similar injuries elsewhere in her body. The other injuries were caused by a blade. Only her skull was broken. A very big fracture indeed! I would say someone hit her in the head with a heavy stone. She was thrown in the water. Did the killer count on the current to carry the body away? So Catoun Garrel was possibly murdered. Very well, doctor. Carry on and keep us informed. Gentlemen, as you will understand, I cannot order an investigation based on mere observations, as troubling as they may be. Which they are. Shall we go, Langelin? Thank you, doctor. Captain. Any news on Catoun? Murder hasn't been confirmed. The coroner hasn't issued his final report yet. He's had the body for three days. He can't determine the cause of death? The cause of death is skull fracture caused by trauma. Accident or assault? The doctor needs to carry on the investigation. Well, I won't wait. The paper's going to choose. We will fuel and support the theory of a murder. What's going on? You said the police interrogated G. Vauban. What if her death was accidental, after all? Félix, look me in my eyes. Do you think I'm wrong? You know Guillaume is shady. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. Do it. Catoun Garrel A Murder Case? Put the bastard behind bars! - Hello, sir. - Ms. Deputy Prosecutor. I wanted to tell you that... Fanny Morane committed suicide last night. Since I saw you first, could you please inform the Prosecutor? I don't feel like shaking hands with him. Thank you, Deputy Prosecutor. Mélanie, please, she killed herself. She wasn't executed. Fanny Morane's death is tragic, but I'm not not blame. That's not what I said. We all have moments of weakness. Believe me, I know. Fortunately, not everybody commits suicide for... For so little? That's what you were going to say? You can be so harsh, Paul. I got this. The assessment on Catoun's bike. Alright, so... "Guillaume's fingerprints were found "on the handlebars. "He possibly faced the bicycle "to prevent Catoun Garrel from leaving. "He grabbed the handlebars so she would stop". What happened next? Guillaume must be interrogated. Yes, yes. Of course. Mélanie Florian, Deputy Prosecutor. Yes. Yes, of course. Soriano. Very well. I'll give him your message. The police found something. I was dying to do it. Read! I know you wouldn't be capable of killing that Catoun girl. But this goddamn paper clearly thinks you are. They think you're the perfect suspect. Bravo! If you need an alibi, I'm here. What for? I didn't do anything. - Damn it! - Dad? Shut up! Just... shut up. A bandana. And? Langelin found it in some bushes near the crime scene. And so you conclude it's a murder? The examining magistrate will rule the death, after we hear the main and only suspect. Whom? Guillaume Vauban. The bandana complicates things for him. Besides, it's the typical item a motorcyclist would wear. There are other people in Bergerane who wear bandanas. It's a bit flimsy. Don't you think. Captain? Hello, madam. Mr. Prosecutor, welcome. Come on in. This is your table. - Thank you. - I'll be right back. I'm so tired of being scrutinized by these people everywhere I go. As if they were going to clap their hands and start chanting: "Trial!" It's intolerable. It's understandable. They see Guillaume swaggering on his bike, no explanation whatsoever. Explanation? About what? - That girl didn't just die. - Maybe she did, after all. What do we know? Did you hear anything? See anything? Me neither. We don't know how that girl died. As a matter of fact, the police don't know either. There is no justified suspicion against G. Vauban. Only a few rumors and a bandana. Unbelievable. A bandana. All those people are jealous of his father's fortune. People want blood, Mélanie. People want... Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. It's just a small cut. Berthier? Hey! - What are you doing here? - I was having lunch. I came to the restroom and found you here. May I ask what happened? A little cut. I must have fainted. Help me get up. Wash your face. Holy cow! Thank you, Philippe. - Are you going to be OK? - Yes. You're under pressure right now. I may be able to help you. I know what you're trying to do. Guillaume Vauban, right? Why are you taking so long to start an investigation? Maybe because I wasn't sure about the murder hypothesis. - That's probably why. - You're sure now? Now it's your job to convince me. You'll have the referral tomorrow, first thing in the morning. Tell me... What's the population of Bergerane? 42,000, according to the last census. Guillaume Vauban alone against 42,000 prosecutors. Good luck. And with you as their chief... Yes. What's the point of hiring an audit company if you won't heed their advice? It's not my problem if they don't like the music. My job is to bring them new things. Those idiots have shitty taste. No, Guillaume. Your job here is to... Yes, Laurence? What do they want? No. You don't know where Guillaume is. Period. Did you get the summons? - Perhaps. - You didn't go? You didn't apologize either? The police are looking for you. Guillaume! Come back! Guillaume, stop! I have a bench warrant. Don't be a jerk. Guillaume, stop! Guillaume! Bergerane station will not be a part of the future high-speed track. Our authorities' challenge will be to convince the Regional Council. The vice-president will comment on this issue, although a few hours ago... I want to tell you that it's all bullshit. I'm Guillaume Vauban, and I didn't kill Catoun Garrel. I'm innocent, do you hear me? I'm innocent. - Get off me! - It's over. You, bastards! Dad, tell them they're wrong. I'm Guillaume Vauban, and I didn't kill Catoun Garrel. I'm innocent, do you hear me? - Guillaume. - Get off me! - Calm down. - You bastards! I'm innocent! Dad, tell them they're wrong! - Stop! - Let me go, damn it. - Calm down. - I'm innocent! Laurence, please call Mrs. Gasco at her office. She's a lawyer. Tell her to cancel her meetings and to come as soon as possible. Thank you. This will be a hard day. I won't have time to do everything. If you need help... Yes. As you know, Vauban appeared before Charvin, who put him in custody. Charvin said he was a danger to society. The bail hearing is set for today at 3 PM, which isn't good. I wanted to spend the afternoon on the Dubreuil indictment. The Dubreuil case? That small fraud trial? I mean, it's ridiculous, Paul. According to you. But it's for me to judge. I'm sorry. So, I would like you to represent me at the hearing. - Can I count on you? - Yes, of course. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I guess this is life together. I'm sorry. I assure you, there will be nicer moments. Any instructions you want to give me? Just one. We agree. He should stay in custody. Mr. Vauban, I am so glad to see you. Always a pleasure. Mr. de Groves is waiting. Very well. Gentlemen, two babas. Thank you very much. I understand, my friend, but the law doesn't say that a magistrate should hurry regarding the visitors permit. Usually, convicts' relatives have to wait several weeks until they can have visits. They do? I wonder why we fought so you could get that Prosecutor General position. Rest assured, it's the kind of favor that a man never forgets. I'm assured, yes. At Charente FM, we never forget. It would be a real shame if certain secrets confided by you, came to light. It would be bothersome. Secrets? Me? Yes, you. Secrets. Absolutely. You know what it is. Undertones, confessions, unfortunate indiscretions that you can air when you think the microphone is switched off. The lights can be off, but that doesn't mean the mike is, too. If you knew how many magistrates, politicians - male and female - unionists and CEOs got caught in that kind of out-takes game. I won't tolerate Guillaume being tried at the criminal court for a murder he didn't commit. I should have told you the day it happened because you, too, were there. You were sleeping. You didn't see anything. She was there, with her shirt in her hand, trying to soak it in the water. Her hair was all over her face, she had blood running down her arm and her leg. There was blood everywhere, she was crying... She was too close to the edge. She slipped and she fell down, head first. The rock gashed her head. I swear, I wanted to get in the water and save her, but instead, I stayed there, next to you, paralyzed, petrified, unable to do anything whatsoever. I watched that poor girl drowning and I did nothing. I didn't understand, at the time. I could see myself like one of the accused I see everyday, waiting for me to punish them. I know what the charges are and I know what punishment they'll get, according to the law. However, I've never figured out why do they what they do. The truth is sometimes so deep, so far to find the truth. And then I remembered. Honey, you're driving too fast. We've drunk too much. - Just two or three drinks. - More like four or five. They were little drinks. We'll be there soon, anyway. There are no cops on this road. Maybe not, but there are curves. That's what's fun about it. I love curves. Watch out! Honey? Dorothée! No! No! No! Help! Help us! Somebody help us! Gentlemen, I would like to have a word with you. I was going to invite you to lunch after the funeral, but I have to fly to Paris. Far be it from me to interfere in the Vauban trial, but I personally suggest you to keep your distance. I know and admire your free thinking and your dynamism, but I would like to be sure that neither of you act with excessive zeal to attribute the murder of the young... Catoun Garrel. Catoun, Catoun... What a strange name it is. To ascribe the murder... to Guillaume Vauban. Mr. Prosecutor General, the charges against that boy... Naturally, you had some quite serious reasons for placing him under investigation. Didn't you, Your Honor? Weren't you - by any chance - influenced by the public opinion and the people's resentment towards a young man who comes from a wealthy, powerful, and thus envied family? The same remark goes for you. Of course I had several reasons to open an investigation. Charvin took over... I ordered Guillaume's arrest to protect him from social stoning. It was in his best interest. The current situation of the Vauban boy is not the problem. I am actually worried about his future trial. A few days ago, at the chancellery, I was approached by a collaborator of the Secretary of Justice... Let me guess. Was it Serge Vauban? Be it as it may, this eminent collaborator of the Attorney General insisted that you and judge Charvin - his two local favorites, as he amiably calls you - do not let yourselves carried away by your zeal. A girl was murdered. Please, Your Honor. The cause of death was traumatic brain injury. Caused by a blunt object. Perhaps. However, "perhaps" is not "definitely". That object was never found. As far as I know, Guillaume Vauban was very much in love with the Catoun girl, and he keeps claiming innocence everyday. This is nonsense. The case must be dismissed. And the public opinion would accept the dismissal. Of course, we should prepare it first with the provisional release of the defendant. You don't say! He's not very happy, but his job... is almost over, I must say. As opposed to yours. How will you carry out your prosecution speech? I haven't elaborated a strategy yet, but I'm thinking about it. You do realize how important you are for society and for justice itself. Let me tell you that the people of Bergerane consider you as a crusader against iniquity, an outstanding... righter of wrongs. Besides, you have served justice with such a devotion, that it might be time for you to start thinking about yourself. That's why I would like to tell you... that a Prosecutor General position... in Bordeaux is going to be vacant soon. Hello, madam. This way, please. Charente FM, the radio that listens to you. With us now is Mrs. Giselle Gasco, Guillaume Vauban's lawyer. - Hello, Mrs. Gasco. - Hello. What can you tell us about today's reconstruction at the creek? It was the occasion to hear Vauban's claims of innocence yet again. Poignant declarations made with such conviction that we wonder why people are still questioning his sincerity. Another interesting element is the presence of prosecutor Berthier and Mrs. Mélanie Florian at the surroundings of the alleged crime scene. An interesting statement? This may surprise you, but no. They were at less than 50 m away from the so-called crime scene, and yet, they didn't see or hear anything. - That's puzzling. - And so your conclusion is...? Honestly, I wouldn't even think about the prosecutor and his deputy hiding part of the truth in whatever circumstance, so I suppose nothing happened that day, in which case my client would be cleared from all charges. Thank you for coming to Charente FM. Charente FM. And now, our weather forecast. Tomorrow morning, sunny skies for western Charente, although clouds will gather in the afternoon due to a sea front that... Were you listening to the radio? Who's Giselle Gasco? What is she playing at? She's doing her job, honey. That's all. But I do intend to fight back, especially since the people are with me. She's backed up by Serge Vauban's firepower. The only power Vauban has, is the love for his son. And justice doesn't care about love, does it? Although sometimes it doesn't care about truth, either. What if he's innocent? Then I would lose face. And justice would lose face, too. So, he can't be innocent. You look beautiful tonight. Justice for Catoun! Good. Please tell your full name to this court. Guillaume Thomas Etienne Vauban. Profession? Most people think I have none, or says I'm a pain in the ass. Order, please. This is no place for jokes, sir. Especially not jokes of bad taste. My apologies, Your Honor. - Can I say something? - Once the questioning begins. It's an important statement. You don't decide how this trial is conducted! Only a few minutes ago, my client revealed to me what he wants to say. His statement might change the course of this trial. Well. The defendant has the floor. Be brief. Thank you, Your Honor. Don't worry, this will only take a few seconds. What I want to say is that you must not take into account my version up to now. I'm actually guilty of the murder of Catoun Garrel. I killed her. What is that nonsense? He's lying! He couldn't have killed that girl! Order! Sit down. Order, or I'll clear the room. Your Honor, I ask for a recess. The defense agrees with the motion of the public prosecution. Very well. The hearing is now suspended. The trial will resume at 2 PM. Take the defendant. Wait... Did you hear that? He confessed! He said it! He killed my Catoun! That bastard deserves to rot in jail! Please. Thank you. Are you out of your mind? - This is insane! - Calm down. I told him to declare himself guilty. He didn't kill that damn girl! He's innocent. He's said it enough. I know this kind of juries. Denying everything won't make him win their sympathy. That would've put them off. I'm speaking as a lawyer. A self-confessed man is easier to defend than an improbably innocent boy. He confessed. I can plead manslaughter. They're arguing, Catoun falls in the water, she gets hurt, Guillaume tries to save her but sadly, it is too late. Is that true, Guillaume? Is that what happened? No. That is not the truth. That's not what happened. - Your version is untenable. - Be quiet! Just be quiet. Tell me everything. Hi. - Going to the creek? - Get lost. You're too close, you're going to make me fall. This is a lousy road. I can take you if you want. I won't leave my bike. I don't have a lock. I'll give you mine. It should be enough to protect your bicycle. Wait for me. What are you doing? Go. Do you want me to speak like a poet or like Guillaume? How does Guillaume speak? He's raw, vulgar, rude, obscene. But he's real. I prefer the poet. It won't change anything anyway. Catoun, you drive me crazy. I want to lie down and make love to you. And do it again and again. You're insane. You thought I would say 'yes'? Well, it's a 'no'. Take off the damn lock. Come on. I said 'take the lock off'! There. You could've said 'thank you'. Or 'goodbye'. - Or even smile at me, damn it! - Go to hell! Why don't you like me? You think I'm a thug? I'm a virgin, asshole. That's perfect. I could be your first. In your dreams. Stay with me, for fuck's sake. Why are you treating me like this? Come here, damn it. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to. I'm sorry. Shit, you're hurt. Here. Take this. Come on. Let's go to the hospital. That was the last time I saw her. I don't know when or how she drowned. I climbed on my bike and took off. Did you read the autopsy report? Yes. - Well? - Yes, she was a virgin. So, Guillaume, No uncalled-for declarations. I will be the one who speaks. Yes. You're going to say that he takes back his confession. You do realize no one will believe him. It's an order. Catoun drowned because of their argument. Forget about her! My son is the only one that counts. It's a matter of honor. The Vaubans are not killers. Very well. You're the one who pays. It's going to be alright. Come in. You wanted to see me? There's a problem with the confession. A problem? He's lying. What do you mean? He's not guilty. I saw everything, Mélanie. You were there, too, but you were asleep. I saw Catoun Garrel fall down the rocks. I saw her head hit, bounce back, and then hit again. - I saw everything. - What are you saying? She was on the other side of the creek. She was alone. Guillaume wasn't there. She got close to the edge, she was covered in blood. She leaned forward, she probably wanted to wash in the river... And that's when she slipped and fell... I killed her. What? I killed her by looking at her, by watching her drown without even trying to save her. A murder by omission. Failure to assist a person in danger. Article 223-6. 5 years in prison and a 75,000-euro fine. Why didn't you save her? I saw you. You're a good swimmer. Three years ago, when Dorothée died in that car accident, she literally lost all of her blood. I was covered in it, That red, warm, sticky liquid that stinks of copper... Hematophobia. Do you know what it is? Yes. It's the pathological fear of blood. It started that day, in that shattered car. When I saw all that blood coming out of my wife, the woman I loved... Over time, and also thanks to you, I thought I'd forgotten all that red. But phobias are stubborn, Mélanie. Seeing Catoun covered in blood scared me. I was staggered. I couldn't move... I killed her, Mélanie. I killed her. What are you going to do? I'll clear Guillaume. What else can I do? Our friends at the chancellery will be thrilled. They will think I bowed my head so I could win their extra points. How do you like Bordeaux? It's a nice town. Stop, Paul. Be quiet. Goddamn... This whole thing is disgusting. I'm so tired. And now? Now I'm going to do what I should've done in the first place. I know you'll do the right thing when this ends. Come in. The hearing is about to resume, sir. Thank you. Let's go. Mr. Prosecutor General will now make his indictment. Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of this court, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Mrs. Gasco - who will take the floor on behalf of the defendant - will craftily introduce you to a Guillaume Vauban that you probably don't know. A fragile, sensitive young man who doesn't belong in the dock. I will address Guillaume Vauban's current situation in a few moments. But regarding the so-called virtues of Guillaume Vauban, I will have to differ with Mrs. Gasco. Far from being an angel, Guillaume is what we call a scoundrel, a little rascal, as people used to say in the 60's, Your Honor. At that time, Carné's Children of Paradise were becoming Young Sinners. And actually, Guillaume Vauban is a sinner. A young man who is constantly looking for speed, sex, drugs and provocations of all sorts as a way to escape from reality for a little while. Guillaume Vauban doesn't love himself and he may have a point. But does that make him a killer? During his time in prison, he never ceased to claim innocence. Did we believe in his pleas of innocence? Of course not. Now that he declares himself guilty of the murder of Catoun Garrel, do we have to believe in that sudden confession? He said he was innocent. We had myriad objections to put forward. His execrable behavior, his numerous misdemeanors, speeding, late-night disturbances, public intoxication, fights... Closer to this case, the fact that Catoun Garrel had told to several witnesses that she was scared of him because he had threatened her. Not to mention Guillaume's prints on her bike, his bandana in the scene and especially, the twist we got to witness this morning. Guillaume Vauban declared himself guilty of murdering C. Garrel. Order, or I will clear the room. It is my duty to warn you against that kind of hasty conclusions. Regarding my client's confession, I will have... You will speak when you take the floor, Mrs. Gasco. Right now, I'm going to have to ask you to remain seated. You may continue, Mr. Prosecutor General. Thank you, Your Honor. I think I know what Mrs. Gasco wants to tell us regarding Guillaume's confession. She will rightly point out the fact that innocent people sometimes confess crimes they didn't commit. Some of them, for unclear reasons, feel guilty about not being judged and sentenced for the crimes they're responsible for. Fraud, malicious acts, deceits, sometimes acts of violence, treason, cowardice. Unconsciously, they're looking for things they could be accused of. This might sound far-fetched, but believe me, a person doesn't need to be a masochist to have a deep yearning for punishment. Finally, Mrs. Gasco will say that the Guillaume's confession was too good to be true, and is thus poorly-grounded. I would like to thank my colleague for putting so much energy into assisting me in my plead... My dear colleague, I'm only following the wise advice that well-placed people at the chancellery had the deference to give me. It seems that the justice in general and myself in particular - a public servant - will benefit from Mr. Vauban's acquittal. Many good things will come to me if I remain compliant. I no longer have to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt - I have to be submissive. Any news, Mr. Prosecutor General? What did Berthier say? You're leaving? Any thoughts, Mr. de Groves? Mr. de Groves, please. It's de Groves. Call Paris, place Vendôme. Judicial Services Office. I want a meeting with the president tomorrow, and make a reservation on the next train to Paris. You can kiss your job goodbye, Berthier. I must admit I almost asked the jury to clear Guillaume from all charges. However, by winning the respect of some of my colleagues, wasn't I going to lose the esteem and trust that the people of Bergerane had for me? Remember you are bound to an obligation of confidentiality. I'm getting to my point. I do not know what the jury and judges will discuss during the deliberation, but I do know what I see in eyes of the audience, in the eyes of the citizens of this town. No more renunciation, they say. No more indulgence, no more permissiveness, they cry. I assure you, people of Bergerane, that your thirst for justice will be quenched. Justice might be the only great idea that we have left, in a world that becomes more and more corrupt, putrid, rotten. If we want to preserve it, we must absolutely save face, even if, paradoxically enough, it is unfair. It is thus in the name of that justice, Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, and in the name of a city that remains at my side, that I ask you to declare G. Vauban guilty of the murder of Catoun Garrel, and to sentence him to life imprisonment. Mélanie Florian asked to be heard as a witness. After a 50-minute deliberation, Guillaume Vauban was absolved. Paul Berthier was removed from office by the Council of Magistrates. Subtitles: Eclair Media
