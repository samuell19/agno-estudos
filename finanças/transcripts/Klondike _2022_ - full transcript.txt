Why does he drive our car around, Tolik? - Please, sweetheart, don't be tense. - Shut up, sweetheart... am not is listening... who is guilty and who is not. They bombed the stroller! Where will I put my child? Don't worry... I’ll rip the dick off his separatist body, and leave him separated. Tolik... Listen carefully: Go and bring our car. Tomorrow we're getting a new stroller. Irka, are you sure you're ok? Tolik... Maya... Cowards! Traitors, idiots Don't even dream, that I'll be scared of you. And look at my mouth carefully: Get out of my house, fucking separatists!

Go to hell, asshole. Eat it yourself. Tolik, it was a mistake. We will fix your house. Take some chocolate to your Irka. Maybe she'll walk faster. Why didn't you come? We were waiting for two hours in the car. A place in the hospital was ready for her to stay... We didn't beat you enough at the orphanage, I can fight you one more time. Fuck off, go beat your wife. Where is my car? You'll get it back now. The guys will buy beer and be back. - Sanya, what is going on? - I told you already... ...the guys will buy beer and be back.

Do you want some food? Sanya screw you, where is my car? Calm down! When the Russians come, we will live like the nobles. Tell that to your wife! Sit down, still!

First grow some balls around your wife. Yaryk, be quick, we have 2 min max... Hello, sister! Get ready fast! Take winter clothes. And be fast! Just take your passport. Where is it? Did Tolik take it? Yaryk... We lost electricity, can you fix it? Sure, I'll do some gardening as well! Get ready! You're coming with us. Are you ok? Let's get out of here. Wait for me here.

I am so tired of all these mistakes. What are you doing? I am cleaning my house! Do you think these were the guys who deserted the army? Do you think they would bomb airplanes? I think they need to drink less and think which side to shoot. Alcoholics! Where is our rope? I told you to stay! Stay, back. Go back. - Go inside... - Who are these people? They are rescuers. - Sanya! - Wait a sec.. Irka, go in. Please! - Sanya! - Wait a minute. - Sanya! - I'm here! Go inside, don't look at the body. Do you hear me? Go inside! - Clear this! - Ok. Tolik!
