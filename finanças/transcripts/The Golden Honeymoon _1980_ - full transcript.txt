CONDUCTOR: All aboard! All aboard! WOMAN: Oh, yes, I have everything. I don't know about your father, though. You know, he didn't let me talk. I think this is our compartment right in here. All right. Right in here. You'll write as soon as you get down to Florida. CONDUCTOR: All aboard, please. This is it. Oh. Where's your father? Damn it. If you don't watch him every minute-- there he is. So my daughter Edie said, look here, why don't you and Mother just close up the house, turn off the water, go down to Florida. Um, Sir? We was in Tampa, Florida four years ago. Um, I think someone's trying to get your attention. Oh. That's just mother. You'd better go get him. He looks like he's going to stand there and just talk. Anyway, my son-in-law, John H. Kramer, the real estate man, he said, look here, Dad. He said, Tampa ain't the only place to go in Florida. In fact, he said Saint Petersburg is the place, and he said, just say the word and I'll make inquiries at the Rotary Club in St. Pete. John's in the Rotary, of course. Oh, here he is now. Come on. Get on the train. John. H Kramer, my son-in-law. Sir, I'm sorry. I didn't get your name. I'm Charley Tate. How do you do? Come on, Dad. Yeah, all right. Are you in the Rotary? No, I'm an Elk. That's all right. It's nice chatting with you. Come on. All right, all right, John, all right. Would you put down that dog? I can't, I can't. Why not? I'm tending it for a lady who went on the train. But you can't get on the train with a dog. Well, that's why I'm tending it, John. Ah, here she is. Oh little Sonia. Didn't you miss me? Thank you so much, Sir. Pleasure being of service. Nice meeting your dog. CONDUCTOR: Get on the train. Thank you, thank you. Goodbye, Sonia. Let go of me, John. JOHN: Now come along. Well, Lucy love, we made it, and right on time. Don't "Lucy love" me. Oops. Don't tell me I've done it again. No, no. I'm just thinking of murdering you. That's all. He is 80 years old and he's traveling to Tarpon Springs with his wife and two unmarried daughters, and I passed the remark that it must be a little crowded for four of them in one compartment, and he said that they've made the trip so often that they'd learned how to stay out of each other's way. Johnny, I wish you wouldn't go wandering off so much. You're liable to get off at one of these stops and I'll go on my golden honeymoon trip without you. Don't you worry, Lucy love. I'll always be right here beside you. Sure you do. Here's your eyes, Lucy love. Oh, thank you, Charley. You know, Charley, my feet are aching. My ankles are still all swollen from just sitting. Oh. There's going to be a good foot doctor in St. Pete. I just know it. In one more day, we'll be in St. Pete sitting under a coconut tree, sucking oranges and having the time of our lives. Charley. Thank you for my glasses. Saint Petersburg, next stop. Saint Petersburg. We made it. Driver, when we was down here four years ago, it was over in Tampa, there was a taxi driver that used to meet us-- Not now. Not now, Charley. Why not? Because when you get started, you never know when to stop. Well, if the good Lord didn't give us tongues to talk with, I don't know why he gave them to us. He didn't give 'em to you so you could say the same thing over and over. Well now, look, not everything I say is going to sound new to you, but it might sound new to other folks. I mean, not many folks have been living with me as long as you have. No, because nobody else could put up with you that long. There's no getting ahead of Mother. I guess this is it, yeah? Hm? All right, Lucy. Come on. Easy does it. Well, driver, thank you for the ride. That was fine. Here. There you go. DRIVER: Thank you, Sir. CHARLEY: I'll help you with these. Let me have those, and I'll take the brown one. Come on. Thank you. It's a nice street, Charley. Yeah. Good morning. Good morning. Are you, by any chance. Mrs. Croft? Yes, that's right. Well, we're Mr. and Mrs. Tate from Trenton, New Jersey. Why yes, we've been expecting you. Come on in. Ah well. I'll get one of the boys to get your luggage. Rotarians recommended your place. Now I can see why. Yeah. Ah, lovely. Right this way. Dandy, isn't it? Did you all have a nice trip? Yeah, yeah. Good. Thank you, Miss Croft. Thank you. You want me to carry you across? Oh, Charley. If you was to throw out your back trying, that wouldn't be any honeymoon at all. I love you anyhow. Fine. Fine. Nice. Yeah. What do you think? We spent $60 a week for that fleabag in Tampa. Lucy? What? Oh. Well, them Rotarians done right by Johnson and Mrs. Croft. Yes, sir. Oh, it's a lovely room, Charley. View. Ooh. [chuckling] CHARLEY: You know, it's a pity about that Mrs. Croft, young widow lady like that having to make ends meet all by herself. You just keep your eyes off her, Charley T. I don't want you romancing no other woman than me on this trip. Oh Mother, we're on our golden honeymoon. I don't think I'll have time for anyone else. Besides, you're-- you're handful enough for any man. Oh, Lucy. Look, look. Oh, Charley. At the famous Poinsettia Hotel, I understand they charge $0.75 for a little sirloin steak, which is because they got fellows out West who rub the cows down to keep them soft. Give me a break, Charley, will you? Oh, we've got folks can't think and play checkers at the same time. Some people can't think when somebody else don't shut up. That's your move? Yeah, that's my move. CHARLEY: You're sure and all? I think your hearing's starting to go, Charley. So my hearing is starting to go. King me. Dr. Kelsey will be with you in just a few minutes now, Mrs. Hartsell. Oh, thank you. Would you like to look at a magazine? Why, that's very kind of you, but I think I'm next. Thank you. Has he worked on you before? No. This is my first visit. Mine, too. My landlady says he's a pretty good foot doctor. Well, my husband is a medical man, and he says Dr. Kelsey is the best chiropodist in Saint Petersburg. Is that so? Um, what end of medicine would your husband be in? He's a veterinarian. Hm. I guess he'd know about feet. By the way, I-- I'm Mrs. Charley Tate from New Jersey. Pleased to meet you. Mrs. Frank Hartsell. Hillsdale, Michigan. Frank Hartsell? I once knew a Frank Hartsell in Weehawken, New Jersey. That must be my Frank. He's originally from Weehawken. Well, for goodness sake. Isn't that something? Yes. Hm. Is he here in St. Pete? I imagine he's pitching horseshoes right now in Williams Park. Well, for goodness sake. Ah. How do you happen to know Frank, Mrs. Tate? Well, Frank Hartsell and me were engaged to be married 52 years ago. He was such a handsome young man with that head of wavy brown hair. Ah, not too good. Frank gets upset if I bother him while he's pitching. Ah. Lucy Frost. Excuse me, gentlemen. Lucy Frost. I'd know those eyes anywhere. How are you, girl? Oh, pretty fair. How about yourself? Just fine, just fine. Oh, you won't believe what happened, Frank. I was sitting in Dr. Kelsey's office and Mrs. Tate introduced herself, and of course, when she said she knew you, I said-- You still married to that errand boy? 50 years ago last month. Charley was chief dispatcher before he retired. Good for him. Why don't you come over to the checkers and say hello? Charlie gets such a kick out of seeing you, Frank. Well, let me get my hat. I hope you won't get too tired hearing the three of us talk over old times. Lucy Frost. Lucy Frost. Your move, Charley. Charley? Look who's here, Frank Hartsell and Mrs. Hartsell. Who? Frank Hartsell, Charley. That is the prize. Well, well. What happened to all your hair? Same thing that happened to your first set of teeth. No, all mine save three. I'd like you to meet the missus. Cora? How do you do? I'm pleased to meet you, ma'am. Yes, well. Ed? Ed, I guess my past has caught up with me. You're going to have to get somebody else to beat you for awhile. Har, har, har. Well, perhaps we should go somewhere. We could sit down, talk. Well, we know a dandy cafeteria on Central Avenue that we run onto. The Rialto? Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. It's, um-- we take most of our meals there, Mother and me. It suits us up and down. Yeah, about $2 a day on the average, but as I always say, I don't mind paying the price if the food is clean and well prepared. Actually, we prefer Trabert's on Third Avenue. Yeah. Well, if you're paying, I don't care if we eat in the cellar of Clancy's garage. Same old Charley. Lucy? Our other daughter, Florence, she married a man in the shoe trade in Philadelphia, so we don't see too much of her. She was always the independent one, Florence was. Frank Junior is in the furniture business. He's got a good size factory up in Grand Rapids. The Rotarians tried to talk my son-in-law John into joining them, but John said, my home is my club. Frank Junior is in the Rotary. He joined them. He joined them but that was because my daughter Edie talked him into it. She can talk the birds right out of the trees. She's my daughter. Frank Junior's the vice president. He believes in service like his father. Frank, you know, was president of his club for three terms. Why, Frank. You must have done good out there nursing them sick cows, Frank, after you run out of Weehawken. I made a fair living at it, Charley, worked pretty hard. You must have been a regular angel of mercy there, getting up in the middle of night and delivering all them calves. That's enough, Charley. Oh my word. Why, my eyes is bigger than my stomach. I don't believe I can finish what's on the plate. But it was good food, I must say. The prices may be just a little dear, but certainly, thank you. As I said, why don't you folks stop over at our place, we'll play a little cards? Ah. Don't that sound like fun, Charley? I've got a checker game at 3:00 PM. Tonight, then. Tonight. Tonight, taking Lucy to the best eating place in St. Pete. [inaudible]. Poinsettia Hotel Oh. Tomorrow, then. It'll be real nice, wouldn't it, Charley? I don't mind. Ah. CHARLEY: There was dancing in the ballroom at the Poinsettia, and I seen them, and Mother favors dancing, and I said, well, it's your birthday. Let's trip the light fantastic. Yes, well, she likes it. I'm not very good at it. But anyway, she said no. She said, I can't writhe at my age the way they got to today. So we just sat and watched them for awhile, and then finally, she got disgusted with it and said, we've got to go to a good movie to get the taste out of our mouth. Then the bill comes, right? $4.20 two little sirloins wouldn't do for one. Oh my, my. I'll tell you, good thing you don't have a birthday everyday, Mother, or we'd be in the poorhouse by now. If every day was my birthday, Charley, I'd be old enough by now to be in my grave long ago. [laughing] Oh my, my, my. There's no getting ahead of Mother. [coughing] Well anyway, we-- we went to the movies. Well, I've got to tell you, honestly. They had a young fellow there. He was Mexican, I'm sure-- not Spanish, Mexican-- and they had him duded up like the king of France, worse than the dancing, really. Well, just awful. One diamond. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Pass. One heart. One fish. Two clubs. Pass. Two diamonds. Two spades. Two no trump. Pass. Three no trump. Four spades. CHARLEY: Pass. Pass. WOMAN: Pass. I think you've got us, Cora. One spade. I was sure you had at least a queen. Your lead, Lucy. All right, Charley. What's eating you? Nothing. I've been married to you 50 years. Don't tell me nothing. Well, it's practically unpatriotic for a New Jersey man to be going to a Michigan society social. Well, they invited us and we can't offend them. Anyway, the Hartsells is the first nice class people we've met since we've been here and I enjoy being with them. Yeah, I noticed as much. Well, if you aren't enjoying yourself, Charley, it's your own fault. No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Was enjoying myself. Playing checkers with that Ed Weaver who has the personality of a rag. Well, I'll tell you, I would rather play with a rag than play with that Cora Hartsell. She's the most terrible card player I've played with in my life. She takes the cake, any card player I've ever seen. That don't give you the right to go insulting her. Look, Lucy, did we come down here to have a good time or just to not offend Frank Hartsell and his chatterbox wife? You wouldn't be exactly welcome at a Quaker meeting yourself, Charley. And as for that husband of hers, I thought I got rid of him 52 years ago when he run out of Weehawken. Frank didn't run out. He went West to be a veterinarian. Ah. That's what he'd like you to believe maybe, but the real reason is why he went because he was so broke up when you chose me over him. You know everything, don't you Charley? Didn't say that. I just know what I know. Hm. Ooh. [band playing waltz] Your move, Charley. I know. Yes, very fine. Charley? Charley, we're going over to Trabert's to get some dinner. Oh. I ain't sure I'm hungry right now. Go on, Charley. Work up an appetite on the way over. Hey, Frank. Why don't you and me have a little quick game of checkers here and then we'll all go over together? Oh no, no, Charles. I'm not a checker man. You wouldn't have any fun at it. Oh, yes I would. Yes, I would. Ed, just slide over and let Mr. Hartsell sit down. Come on. Come on. Come on, Frank. Come on. If you ladies don't mind. You go right ahead, Frank. Are you serious? Here, Lucy. Now, I haven't played in quite a few years. Here. Now, if I do anything stupid, you let me know, you hear? Yes, I will. [inaudible], Lucy. All right. You're too good for me, Charley. Well, checkers is really a children's game anyway, isn't it? Well. I mean, our grandchildren's friends, they all play checkers all the time. It sure is the way your husband plays it. How would you like to play some horseshoes, Charley? Yes, and Frank will beat you good. Well, I'll give him a chance to get even. I haven't played horseshoes in 16 years, must be. I haven't played checkers in 20. You ain't never played checkers. Anyway, Lucy and I are your masters at cards. Well, we all know why that is. Darn it, Lucy, why did you have to invite the Hartsells to the New Jersey social? Well, the way you insulted Cora Hartsell's card playing, I had to do something. They never would have spoken to us again. Well, that would suit me up and down. Cora happens to be a very refined woman and belongs to three different card clubs in Hillsdale. Well, why does he always grab you for a partner if his wife is such a good player? He's just being a gentleman, which is something you don't know too much about, I suppose. Well, if he's such a gentleman, you probably wish you'd married him instead of me. Why Charley, you sound like you're jealous. Oh boy. Me, jealous of a cow doctor from Hillsdale, Michigan? And you know what? He's such a gentleman, how come at his age, he don't know that it's impolite to expectorate in the direction of ladies? I've seen you do it quite a few times. I ain't had no tobacco in my mouth for 10 years and you know that, Lucy Tate. Charley, don't be so cranky. You'll upset your stomach. [whistling] [cooing] Sounds more like a chicken to me. I guess you hear a lot of chickens in your line of work. [applause] Wasn't she wonderful? [applause] And now, ladies and gentlemen, a real treat, Ralph Lynn and Buddy. [applause] Very glad to have met you, Sir. It's very interesting talking to a politician. BUDDY: What makes you think I'm a politician? Well, your head's made out of wood. [laughter] BUDDY: Very funny, very funny. Just because I'm Mr. Snodgrass, or that's what they call me, it's no reason for you to pick on me. VENTRILOQUIST: I wasn't picking on you. We were talking about politicians, and politicians have wood heads. BUDDY: Oh. I thought you were the politician. Don't you make your living manipulating dummies? [laughter] [applause] Weren't they wonderful, folks? [singing] Your husband's been gone quite a while, hasn't he? He's probably talking some pour soul's ear off. You know Charley. [applause] Wasn't she great? And now, ladies and gentlemen, for our next attraction, we have a real old time storyteller. Let's give a real nice welcome to Charley Tate. [applause] Well, ladies and gents, I didn't expect to be, um, called on on this occasion to make a speech, or at any other occasion. I-- I don't hold myself to be a speechifier. I-- I'll just-- well, do the best I can and, um, as I always say, that's all anybody can do. Well, I-- I'm down here in St. Pete on my golden honeymoon. Along with me, of course, by my side, is my lovely, dear, little wife of 50 years, Lucy Tate, right here in the front row. Um, stand up, Lucy. [applause] Stand up, dear. Come on. [applause] There she is. There she is. She's shy. In fact, you know, when-- when-- when, um, Lucy and I were first married, we-- we made an agreement, and that was that the little and unimportant decisions would be made in our married life by Lucy, and I would make all of the-- of the big, important decisions, you know. The only thing is that in 50 years of marriage, there ain't never been no important decisions. [laughter] I remember my uncle Mike, um, back there in New Jersey, the great state of-- of New Jersey. [applause] He-- he-- [applause] Quite a speechifier. You've got one on me again, Charley. Don't look at it that way, Frank. Well, I wouldn't have believed an audience would sit so still for 40 minutes. More like 60, wasn't it? Listen, I'm sure Frank Junior would want you for the Rotarians if you ever got up to Grand Rapids, don't you think, Frank? Oh yes, sure, sure, sure. Say, why don't we go to our place, play some cards? What do you say, Lucy? It's a bit late, isn't it? Yes, it is. I'm a little tuckered, Mother. Well, I want to get a good night's sleep. I'm playing shuffleboard in the morning. Lucy, that reminds me I meant to ask you Mrs. Greenway's husband had a stroke. She can't play, and I was wondering if you'd like to play. I haven't played in ages. Oh sure you could. Lucy, it's more a social thing anyway. We play a little, then we have tea together. Mother's always been good at games. So has Cora. OK, Lucy. Your turn. Step into it, aim carefully, and stroke. [chuckles] That's not bad, Lucy. Oh, it's all right, Lucy. We didn't expect you to be very good. Oh, I'm sorry. I can't go on. My back's got two lame to stoop over since the last time I played. I'm sorry for messing up the game, Frank. Oh you didn't, Lucy. Cora's putting a show on for my benefit. Since when do you have a lame back? Since you don't have no more sympathy than to laugh when I'm doing the best I can. Lucy, I have some linament. Rub it in and you put a hot towel on it. She don't need a horse doctor. Charley. [yells] [laughing] Charley, sit down. [laughter] When you're ready to play horseshoes, you'll know where to find me. Excuse me, Lucy. Certainly. CHARLEY: It was funny to me. Don't talk to me, Charley Tate. How can I help it if I've got a sense of humor? I wish you had. Maybe you wouldn't have made such a fool of yourself at the social last night acting like a four-year-old. What are you talking about? I was good last night. Well, you heard what the Hartsells said last night. They was just being refined. Ain't nobody finds you funny, Charles. They just put up with you because they can't figure out how to get rid of you. [cheering] Beautiful. Your move, Charley. Set 'em up again. I-- I don't care. Never thought I'd say this, Charley, but you're losing so much it's not fun. Darn it. Charley! Lucy? Come on. Come on. Let's get it over with. What are you talking about? You've been waiting for days to see Frank Hartsell beat me at horseshoes. Now you're going to see it. Come on. Now, come on. Come on. Come on. What are you talking about? Come on. [applause] FRANK: Oh. That's too bad, Charles. Next up. [inaudible]. Come on, Charley. [applause] You throw the worst shoe I ever seen. I can't beat luck like that. Charles, that is not luck. That is style. [applause] Trouble with you, Charley, is you have no style. Something wrong with your throat? No. Nothing, nothing, nothing. [laughter] FRANK: Very good, Charles. Very good. [applause] Very nice. Very nice. That's 19 and 6. Let's go. Now look here. I can't play no more. The, um, plating's wore off this shoe and, well, it made my thumb bleed. Let me see it. Let me see it. Plating's wore off the shoe, see? And them little points here come through and they made my thumb bleed. Well, you can use my shoes for pitching. It wouldn't-- it wouldn't make no difference. I can hardly hold a shoe, much less pitch it. I'll play you again when we've got proper pitching shoes. It's too bad, too, because I was just getting the distance. Let me see your thumb, Charley. No need to make any fuss of it. Now, now. Let me see. I'll show it to you when we get home. I'd like to see it myself. No hard feeling. Oh, watch out. Easy does it. All right. You're still a champion at checkers, Charles. No, he ain't. I never lose at horseshoes, and if I always had you as a partner, Lucy, I'd never lose at cards, either. Well, 50 years ago, you had a chance to have her for a partner always, but you wasn't man enough to keep her. Charley Tate, I'm taking you home. You must have had something stronger than tea to drink this morning. Your thumb must hurt worse than you think. Never mind Charley's nonsense, Frank. He's just mad because you beat him all hollow, pitching and playing cards. Who says? Come on, Charley. We-- we'll see you later. Come on. You had no right saying that to Frank in front of his wife and all those people. He had it coming to him. Oh, and now don't talk to me about his wife. He's been making at eyes at you for the last two weeks right under my nose. Frank never made eyes at me. Oh now, you call it what you like. Well-- well you won't have to worry about Frank no more after what you said. I don't know how I'll ever apologize to Cora and him in front of all those people. I guess that'll make you real sad, won't it? Yes, it will. Yeah, and I guess his being such a wonderful horseshoe pitcher and card player makes you wish you married him instead of me. Well, at least he's not such a baby to quit pitching just because he-- his fingers get a few scratches. What about you on that shuffleboard court? Huh? Making a fool of yourself and then pretending you're lame so as you don't have to play anymore. Well, at least I didn't laugh at you when you hurt your thumb, but you sure laughed at me when I sprained my back. Well, who could keep from it? Well, Frank Hartsell didn't laugh. Why didn't you marry him? I almost wish I had. I wish you had, too. I'll remember that. You do what you like. Charley? Dr. Kelsey's nurse told me the Hartsells are going back to Michigan in the morning. Oh. Well, I wish they'd stayed there in the first place. Oh Charley. This is our golden honeymoon. We don't want it spoiled by a-- a silly argument. At least I don't. Well, neither do I. Did you mean what you said about wishing you'd married Frank Hartsell? Of course not. That is, if you didn't mean it when you said what you said. I was tired and riled up. That's all. If I'd wanted to marry Frank Hartsell, I'd have done it 50 years ago when he was begging me. Well I'm sure glad you didn't marry him, Lucy. No woman on Earth could have put up with me as long as you have. What about Cora Hartsell? [laughing] Oh goodness gracious. Could you imagine being married to a woman who plays cards like that, and-- and-- spits out her tea on the shuffleboard court? It would be no worse than being married to a man who expectorates towards ladies and is such a fool in a checkers game. Lucy love. Charley.
