(gentle orchestral music) (light melodic music) (soft haunting music) (Lauren groaning softly) (soft haunting music) (soft ominous music) (Lauren groaning softly) (Lauren thudding to floor) (glass shattering) (tense melodic music) (soft orchestral music) (both laughing) - I've haven't seen these in forever. Is that you? You look so young. - Hey, I still look young. (both laughing) - I'm sorry, yeah, you do. - Oh, I was there for your mom during her pregnancy, as her midwife with you and now here I am. For you and this little one. (soft orchestral music) You know, she's watching over you now, keeping both you and baby safe. Whatever happens, I'll always be there to help. - I know you will, you always have. All right, I should probably head home, Anthony probably doesn't know where I am. But thank you for the tea and the delicious cookies. - You know what, before you go, can you do me a small favor? - Okay, I think that should be good. - Thanks for helping me with this. A little extra security never hurt anyone. - Yeah, not a problem. It's actually a good thing. All of the footage is gonna download itself straight to your laptop. - Hm, you make it sound so easy. (both laughing) - Okay, now everything in here should sync up to your phone. - Oh! - Like that. - And so it did. (both laughing) No idea how you did that. - Pure genius over here. - Yes, of course. (both laughing) So Anthony's work is, is going well? - Yeah, yeah, it's going great, he's super busy. (keyboard tapping) (soft melodic music) - You know, there's something I, I need to tell you. - Julie, is everything all right? (delivery person knocking) Are you expecting someone? - Oh, gosh, I- (computer beeping) - Oh. (laughing) - So many orders lately. Oh, and there he is. - [Lauren] There's the delivery guy. - Oh, well done. Oh, delivery, um, this, I ordered the same thing for you. - What? - [Julie] I want you to install it at your house. - We live in a really safe neighborhood, I- - You know what, you can never be too safe, especially with baby on the way. Please. - Yes, okay, thank you. (soft tense orchestral music) (faucet water running) (floorboards creaking) (soft ominous music) (dog barking in distance) (soft tense orchestral music) (soft tense orchestral music continues) - Hello? Is anyone there? (soft tense music) (soft intense music) (door clicking) (soft ominous music) (cicadas chirping) Hello? (soft tense music) (tense ominous music) (door thudding) (blow thudding) (Julie shrieking) (blow thudding) (vase shattering) Oh, my God! (Julie shrieking) (blow thudding) - Uh! - Oh, my God! No, no, no! (soft ominous music) Oh, God! Oh, God! (door slamming) (Julie breathing heavily) (tense dramatic music) (door thudding) No! No. (attacker grunting) No, no, oh! (door thudding) (Julie shrieking) (objects clattering) - Uh! (Julie thudding to floor) (both grunting) (Julie choking) (tense dramatic music) (attacker grunting) (tool thudding) - Uh! (attacker thudding to floor) (Julie gasping) (tense ominous music) (blow thudding) (soft orchestral music) (tense melodic orchestral music) (tense melodic orchestral music continues) (tense melodic orchestral music continues) (tense melodic orchestral music continues) (tense melodic orchestral music continues) (heart beating) (melodic orchestral music) - And there's your baby. Oh, see that? There's the feet. And, that's the head. - [Anthony] Nice. (heart beating) - Oh, it looks like there's a nuchal cord. - What does that mean? - [Nurse] The umbilical cord is wrapped around your baby. It's just something to keep an eye on. How have you been feeling, Lauren? - She's been having a lot of nausea. - [Nurse] Ah, I can speak to the doctor about that. - [Anthony] Thanks. - Julie should really be here for this. Can you try her again? - Yeah, can we do it after this? - So is everything else looking healthy other than the cord? - I'll have to have your doctor review the photos to answer that, but I can tell you the gender. - No, no. - Yes. - No, Julie has to be here for that. - Right. Okay, yeah. We'll wait. (gentle melodic music) - Ah, Julie is your midwife, correct? - [Lauren] Mm-hm. - With a high risk pregnancy like this, I do recommend having one available. If you're having trouble, the hospital actually has a program, that would be perfectly safe. - We have a midwife. - Right, of course. (gentle melodic music) - Can you try her? - Yeah. Excuse me. (gentle melodic music) - [Lauren] I'm just gonna stop in and say hi. - Oh, you haven't been feeling good all day. I'll go in and check on her, you stay in the car. - I'll be quick, I just need to make sure she's okay. (car door thudding) (Lauren knocking) (soft tense music) (door clicking) Julie, we're coming in! (soft tense music) (floorboard creaking) (Lauren gasping) Did you hear that? - Hear what? Maybe she's not home. - I'm just gonna check upstairs. (footsteps ascending stairs) (soft tense music) (tense ominous music) Ow! Ow! Oh! Ah! (door thudding) (soft tense music) (doorknob rattling) Hello, Anthony! (Lauren knocking) - Lauren? - Someone's locked me in here! (hands thudding) Help me! (tense melodic music) (doorknob rattling) There's somebody here, help me, please. (soft ominous music) (door clicking) - Hey, hey, what's wrong? - There's somebody in the house. The door slammed behind me, there was somebody there. - Oh, oh, are you okay? I-I didn't see anyone. - No, you have the door slammed behind me and someone locked it, the door was locked. There's someone in here. - There's no one here. (police radio broadcasting quietly) - Thanks. So we did a brief walkthrough, and there was nothing obviously stolen or damaged. No sign of struggle, the back door was open, but it doesn't look like it was forced open by any means. - Julie would never leave her house with her front door unlocked. - Well, it's common for people who live around here to not lock their doors. They move here for the safety of the neighborhood. - There was someone in the house, I'm sure of it. - Did you get a look at them? - [Lauren] I, no, but I heard them. (car engine starting) - What about you, Mr. Campbell? (gentle melodic music) - I-I didn't see anyone. - Hm. - Officer Brooks, to be frank, we know Julie very well. She delivered Lauren and was like a second mother to her. She's been our midwife for the past six months. We came to her house, because she stopped answering our calls. Regardless of whether or not someone was in the house today, we think something may have happened to her. - Well, you did the right thing by calling us. We'll ask her neighbors when they saw her last. If it's been more than 24 hours, we'll ask you to come down to the station and file a missing persons report. - [Lauren] Thank you. - Okay. In the meantime, try to get some rest. I'm sure we'll track down Julie. (gentle orchestral music) (tense melodic music) (car rumbling quietly) (tense melodic music continues) (Julie grunting softly) (soft tense orchestral music) (Julie breathing fearfully) (soft tense orchestral music) (car door clicking) (car door thudding) (car door clicking) (Julie gasping fearfully) (tense ominous music) (soft tense music) (gentle melodic music) - [Anthony] Are you feeling okay? (faucet water running) - Yeah. I'm fine. (gentle melodic music) - I'm just worried that what happened at Julie's house might've triggered some of your anxieties. - You really didn't see anyone in the house? - You're exhausted and stressed and probably remembering everything that happened with your mom. - What I heard was real. - I never said it wasn't. (Anthony sighing) I think we should take a couple of days and spend some time at the cabin. - It's too soon, you know that. Thank you, I know you're just trying to help. - If you're stressed, (Lauren laughing) I can help you unwind a little. - Okay, we should stop, we, honestly, we should stop. We need to be careful. If anything were to happen, Julie would be here in five minutes. I can't stop thinking about her, Anthony. The last time I saw her, it was like she wanted to tell me something and then held back like she was scared to stress me out. - Well, people sometimes hold back the truth from people they don't wanna hurt. - She's never had to hold back anything from me in her life, ever. - If she thought it would hurt your feelings, she might. People are wired to circumvent conflict, it's called avoidance coping. - Okay, just stop. - Maybe she no longer felt up to be your midwife and rather than be honest with you, she left. - She would never. - Stop. You're being argumentative. (Lauren sighing) I'm sorry, you've never been anything but patient with me. That's why you're gonna make such a great mother. So thoughtful and loving. - I hope so. - All I want is to be a great dad. So let's be safe, rather than sorry. I'm calling the hospital tomorrow, there's gotta be another midwife willing to take on a crazy couple like us. - I just want Julie. - And you'll get her when she comes out of the woodwork. But we are in the final stretch now, the due date is a few weeks away, we need someone here now. (birds chirping) - Yeah, her first name is Julie. No, Julie, J-U-L-I-E. - [Hospital Worker] Can you hold for a moment? - Yeah, I can hold. Have you heard anything from Detective Brooks? - It's only five o'clock. If he hasn't phoned by eight, I'll call the station and see if there's an update. If you're feeling anxious, remember the five steps of mindfulness. - Hey, stop it, I'm not your patient anymore. That stopped the second we got married. - Maybe so, but the same techniques still apply. - Hi, Mrs. Campbell. - Oh, hi. Yes, I'm still here. - [Hospital Worker] Sorry, there's nobody by that name here. - Okay, yeah, thank you for trying. - [Hospital Worker] Have a good day. - You too. - [Anthony] Still no sign of her? - Oh, I've literally called every hospital in the city, and I forgot to set the timer for the chicken, oh! (doorbell ringing) Ah, you know, I don't know if I can do this. - I talked to the hospital and they said that she's the only midwife available for immediate and full-time work. (oven door clicking) And for all we know, she'll be your new best friend. - I don't need a best friend, you're my best friend, and whoever she is, she's only temporary. (door clicking) Hi, I'm Lauren. - Hi. - You must be Olivia. - Yes. Wow, you have such a beautiful home. - Thank you. - I'm Anthony. - Hi. - Come on in. (melodic piano music) - I run an art gallery, or I mean, I did (laughs) until. My mom used to run it, and it was her pride and joy, and then now I run it for her. - That's so lovely. And what do you do? - He's actually a Professor of Psychology and Ethics at Weston. - No way. Wow! (Anthony chuckling) - So I, I just wanna make sure that you understand, that this position is most likely temporary. We had a midwife with us for the entire pregnancy, and if she comes back wanting her job. - No, I completely understand. - We're also willing to pay whatever it takes. I just need to make sure that I can call you day or night, and that you have the skills to protect our baby, if complications occur. - I can do you one better. I can promise to save you and your baby, and you'll be my only priority, I won't take on any other clients. (melodic piano music) - Well, I think you're hired. (all laughing) - Well, a toast. - Yeah. - To new relationships and creating miracles. - Cheers. - Cheers. (glasses clinking) (Lauren laughing) (cellphone buzzing) - Sorry. (liquid sloshing) - Oh, Lauren, seriously? - Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. - Lauren. - I'm sorry. (cellphone buzzing) Um, it's the detective. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, yeah, it's just, um, I just need to go take a call. - Oh, no, no, no, no, you stay put, I'll step out and I'll bring some towels back. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. (cellphone buzzing) - Okay. Hello. - Hi, Mrs. Campbell, it's Detective Brooks. We found something, a string of emails between Julie and a man named Harrison Chambers, does that ring a bell? - Harrison? Yeah, that's Julie's ex-husband. They divorced a few years ago, he moved back to London. - Well, it looks like they got back together again. She took a one-way trip to London two days ago. Is that around the same timeframe she went silent? - No, there's no way that she would fly across the world for him, and even if she did, she would return my calls and my texts. - Well, I can't explain her motives. I just wanted to tell you that it looks like she's okay. - Well, are we sure that a string of emails is proof? I mean, have you actually spoken to her? - I assure you that we made every effort possible to reach out to her personally. Sometimes people don't want to be found, and the way that Julie up and left, that might be the case. - No, it's not, she is not like that, I promise you. - Lauren, look at this as good news. Your friend is alive and well. (soft tense orchestral music) (soft ominous music) (soft tense orchestral music) (gentle melodic music) - Come on, baby, we got good news today, Julie's okay. - Then who was in her house when I was inside? - You didn't actually see anyone. - So you think I'm making it up? Listen to me, Anthony, I swear on my life, on our unborn child's life, Julie wanted to tell me something. (soft tense music) - A couple of weeks ago at your doctor's appointment, I overheard Julie talking on the phone to Harrison. I got the gist of the conversation. I knew she was planning on leaving. - Why didn't you tell me? - I was, I was hoping I could change her mind. I knew her leaving in the middle of your pregnancy would break your heart and cause you even more stress. I didn't wanna risk anything happening to the baby. (haunting orchestral music) - So she's really gone? (haunting orchestral music) (haunting orchestral music continues) (Lauren gasping) (soft ominous music) (Lauren breathing heavily) (Lauren vomiting) (cellphone buzzing) (soft piano music) - [Julie] "Dear Lauren, I'm so sorry about everything. I shouldn't have left without telling you first, but there was an emergency with Harrison's health back in London, so I've popped off to take care of him and support his family. We were together for so many years, I can't just abandon him in his time of need. You'll have to email me if you need anything. My cell doesn't have an international plan. Love you, Julie." (haunting orchestral music) (muffled Olivia laughing) - Have you, really? - Yeah. Oh, my God, here? (Anthony and Olivia chattering indistinctly) - Never to be heard from again. (laughing) - This is my secret recipe. It's packed with whole foods, vitamins and all the things you need for nice hair, strong nails, and a growing a healthy baby. - Well, I hate to break it to you, but I'm not the one growing a baby. (both laughing) - Good morning. - Mm, that is amazing. - I have a smoothie for you too. I was hoping for our first day together, I could get you set up on this maternity app. (Lauren vomiting) Oh, my God, Mrs. Campbell, are you okay? - (groans) Yeah. (faucet water running) I'm fine. I'm just feeling a little nauseous. I think it's the anxiety of having a new midwife, I just- - Oh, and I have to get to work. Are you two going to be okay? - I don't think I can do this today. - Hey. - We'll be fine, Anthony. Really, but I can give you your space if you need, but I think you should try my signature smoothie. It's been a dream for mothers, who struggle with late term nausea. - Okay. It's nice, but I don't think it's a miracle cure. Actually, I'm feeling a lot more settled. This is delicious, thank you. - As you've experienced, anxiety and uncertainty can trigger nausea, but mild foods help keep the stomach acid low. And I also know some breathing techniques to help with anxiety, it's all here in the app. - Oh, well, then I will head out. - Okay, bye, honey. - Bye, I hope you're feeling better soon. - Thank you, have a good day. - Bye. - Bye. (melodic guitar music) Okay, so let me download that. - Okay. - Awesome. Okay, so do you wanna just type in your birthday and stuff? - Yeah. (melodic guitar music) (heart beating) (melodic orchestral music) (melodic orchestral music continues) (melodic orchestral music continues) - So cute, right? (laughing) So what are you gonna do? While you and Anthony are figuring it out, should we pick a letter? - Yeah, let's pick a letter. - Okay. - Okay. Wait, let's start here. - Okay. (soft orchestral music) (soft tense music) What's that? - Ah, nothing. Would you mind finishing the crib? There's just something I need to do. (soft tense music) (door unlocking) (door clicking) (door thudding) (gentle melodic music) Okay. (gentle melodic music) (keyboard tapping) (computer beeping) (soft tense music) (keyboard tapping) (computer beeping) (soft tense music) (soft tense music continues) (keyboard tapping) (computer beeping) (keyboard tapping) (computer beeping) (soft tense music) (keyboard tapping) (computer beeping) (soft tense music) (soft tense music continues) (zipper whirring) (soft tense music) You leave the country without your favorite purse and your wallet, where are you? (soft tense music) (cellphone beeping) - [Anthony] Hi, you've reached Anthony Campbell. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. (keyboard tapping) (soft tense music) (door clicking) - Anthony, why aren't you answering your cell? I think they don't know about her security camera. Who are you? - I'm... Um, Rachel, um. IT sent me, something's wrong with the computer, but seems to be fine now though. - Where's Anthony? This is his office. - Professor Campbell no longer works here. - Excuse me, what are you talking about? I'm his wife, I think I should know where he works. - You're his wife? - What are you really doing? - Ah, you know, you know what- - Okay, I guess you won't mind if I call security down here to double check. - No, okay, I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wasn't doing anything bad, I'm just worried about a friend of mine. I-I didn't do anything to his computer. Please don't tell anyone I was here. - I won't. (receiver clattering) - [Rachel] Thank you. - So what do you mean Anthony no longer works here? - The police asked me not to talk about it. - The police? - I'm sorry, I've said too much already. You should talk to your husband. - Wait, wait, are you actually good at this IT stuff? - Why? - Could you track an IP address for me from an email? As a favor, please? Since I won't tell anybody about this. - Fine. (door clicking) - Anthony? - Hey. (door thudding) Everything okay? - [Lauren] Fine. Why aren't you at work? - Looking over some case studies from home today. - Is there anything you wanna tell me? Like the fact that you don't work at Weston anymore? - I didn't want to tell you. - [Lauren] So it's true, they fired you? - Calm down, they didn't fire me, I quit. - Then what was the whole thing about the police being involved? (door thudding) - Hey, guys. Everything okay? Did I come at a bad time? - [Lauren] Ah, Olivia, do you mind giving us a minute? - Yeah, for sure. - [Anthony] Who did you talk to? - Why does it matter who I talked to? Some girl named Rachel. - (laughs) Rachel, of course. I didn't wanna stress you out. - Can you stop? Just cut the crap. Tell me what happened. Be honest. - I had to file a restraining order against her. She was obsessed with me, acting inappropriately, following me back to my office, I wasn't even her professor. She just came to me as the guidance counselor for a couple of sessions. (sighing) - She was in your office today. - Again? I am so sorry you ran into her. I got so uncomfortable and I've been wanting to go back to private practice for a long time. It was easier to just quit than to keep dealing with her. I was worried she was gonna start showing up at the house or something. - Then why on Earth did you not tell me? What if she did show up to the house? What was I supposed to do? - I know and I'm sorry. - [Lauren] Stop. - Look, with the pregnancy, I knew any amount of stress could hurt the baby. - Yeah, well, what about me? - Come on. - You're lying to me. It's like, I don't even know who you are anymore. - Listen to me, Lauren. - I need time to think. I don't wanna talk to you. - Lauren. - Stop it. Do not follow me. (haunting orchestral music) (soft ominous music) - Sorry. (haunting orchestral music) (Julie grunting) (Julie breathing heavily) (haunting orchestral music) (Julie breathing heavily) (haunting orchestral music) (Julie grunting) (Julie breathing heavily) (haunting orchestral music) - [Julie] Come on. (Julie grunting) (haunting orchestral music) (Anthony and Olivia chattering indistinctly) - Gimlet, okay. - What are you doing? - Ah, I'm so sorry, I was just surprised, I didn't know you went to Weston. I thought maybe you had mentioned that, considering Anthony's a professor there. - Why didn't you mention that on your resume? - It's just one class a week on nutrition. I really didn't think it was relevant. Really, I-I didn't think it was that big of a deal. - It's not. (gentle orchestral music) (Julie grunting) (ligature snapping) (Julie gasping) (door rumbling) (Julie breathing heavily) (soft tense orchestral music) Bailey. Oh God, it's Bailey's cabin. (Julie breathing fearfully) (sensor clicking) (cellphone buzzing) - I have to go. - [Lauren] What's wrong? - Um, my client just went into labor. I'm so sorry, Lauren, I really have to- - Wait, no, I thought we discussed, that you wouldn't be seeing any other clients, only us, especially this close to the due date. - It's not my client, it's just another patient. I'm on call at the hospital. She's in labor, you guys, I'm so sorry, I have to go. (door thudding) - Why are you so hard on her? - Don't you think she's acting a little strange? Not mentioning that she has other clients, not mentioning that she went to your school? - Lauren. - Don't Lauren me, you're not my doctor. - I'm just worried about you. You've been acting a little on edge, overreacting about insignificant things. Who cares what school Olivia goes to? And maybe she is just on call this week. - I need you to stop worrying about me and start being honest with me. I can worry about myself. (soft tense orchestral music) (door clicking) (Julie gasping fearfully) (soft tense orchestral music) (Julie gasping fearfully) (soft tense orchestral music) (car rumbling) (soft ominous music) - Oh! (gasping) Help, I need help, stop! Oh, God, oh, thank you. Thank you, thank you. (tense orchestral music) No, no, no! (car rumbling) (tense orchestral music) No! (Julie shrieking) (car thudding) (Julie thudding to ground) (haunting orchestral music) (keyboard tapping) (computer beeping) (shower running) (keyboard tapping) (computer beeping) (haunting orchestral music) - Hey, where's Lauren? - Probably at the gallery. - So I just found out the sex of the baby. Do you wanna know what it is? - Tell me. - It's a boy. (laughing) - Hey. Ah, I just got this notice in the mail saying we're late on the heating. - Lauren, you shouldn't be standing for long periods of time. The position of your son could put pressure on the arteries- - My son? - My God, I-I thought that she knew already. - No, it's okay, really, it's great. - What? - We're having a boy. (haunting orchestral music) Lauren. It's okay. Lauren! (door clicking) (door thudding) (door clicking) (door thudding) Lauren. (car door clicking) (car door thudding) Where are going? - Finding out the gender should have been our moment, not hers. - Baby, come on. She just made a mistake, don't be like that. - I need to clear my head. (car door clicking) - You're overreacting. (soft orchestral music) (car door thudding) (car engine starting) (soft tense orchestral music) (cellphone ringing) - Hello? Who is this? - It's Rachel from Weston. - Right, Rachel, I'm sorry, but I don't actually think we should be talking. - Finally talk to your husband then? I have the IP address you wanted, but if you'd rather not speak to me. - Wait, no, no, no, what-what did you find? - I tracked the IP address the email was sent from. - [Lauren] That was fast. - All the information is accessible from your email provider if you know where to look, but it was definitely sent from someone in the city. - So she's not in England? - She wasn't when she sent this. (soft tense orchestral music) Then where is she? (gentle orchestral music) (Julie groaning softly) (gentle orchestral music) (Julie groaning softly) (gentle orchestral music) (Julie groaning softly) (gentle orchestral music) (Julie groaning softly) (doorknob rattling) (Julie grunting) (chain rattling) - No. No! (Julie sobbing) (gentle orchestral music) (Julie sobbing) (gentle orchestral music) (soft intense music) (cellphone buzzing) - Detective Brooks. - Mrs. Campbell, how have you been? - I traced the IP address of an email that Julie sent, and apparently she's not in London, she's still here. - Slow down, you traced an IP address? - Yeah, well, not me specifically. - Well, IP addresses can be changed using a proxy server. - Yeah, Julie wouldn't know how to do that. I don't even know how to do that. - Many people who are trying to run away or disguise their current location might choose to- - When are you gonna give up the idea, that she left voluntarily? - Mrs. Campbell, you're gonna need to trust us. (cellphone beeping) (soft tense music) (birds chirping) (soft tense music) (doorknob rattling) (Lauren thudding) - Stop! You shouldn't be exerting that much force, please, it's too risky. - Olivia, what are you doing here? - I came to apologize about the gender reveal earlier. I really thought that Anthony had told you. I'm so sorry, Lauren, I never meant to take that moment away from you. - Did you follow me? - Yeah, I saw your location on the maternal app. - The app tracks my location? I thought it tracked my pregnancy. - It's important that we always know where each other is, in case of an emergency. If you went into labor and I couldn't find you, I just have to go to- - What do you mean, you thought Anthony already told me? - I found out a few days ago and he asked me to tell him so that he could surprise you. But I guess he hasn't gotten around to it yet. What's going on? Seriously, Lauren, you can talk to me. - I feel like everything is falling apart. - It's totally normal to feel like that. I mean, you have a lot on your plate. - It's not normal, I feel crazy, but I know I'm right. I know something bad has happened to Julie. - I thought she was in the UK. - No, she's not in London, she's still here somewhere. - Lauren, I know it's hard to think about, but the police have been looking for her. - No, I had someone trace her IP address and she is definitely still in the city. - Who traced her IP address? - Long story short, do you remember that girl, Rachel? The one from Weston, the one that Anthony and I- - The one that Anthony has a restraining order against? - Yeah, well, I didn't know who she was or what had happened when I talked to her. I just figured she was good with computers and I was desperate. - You need to stay away from her. I don't think that you should contact her again. I don't want her to show up at your house or anything. I-I can't believe that Anthony didn't warn you about her. - You're right, it was stupid, I shouldn't have. I just, I don't know what's happening. I feel, like Julie's hurt or maybe she's hurting herself. (gentle orchestral music) - Kind of like what your mom did? - How... How did you know that? - I got access to your medical records, when I became your midwife. Lauren, all this paranoia and anxiety, that you're feeling is totally normal, especially after the trauma that you've been through. But you need support. Have you spoken to Anthony about this or talked to your doctor about it? I'm sure Anthony knows some great psychologists, that can help you. - I'm fine. I have a psychologist, thank you. - Okay, when was the last time you talked to them? Lauren, I really think, that you should talk to someone about this. I'm starting to get worried about you and Anthony is too. - I need to go home and I need you to back off. - [Olivia] But... (soft melodic music) (keyboard tapping) (door clicking) (door thudding) - Did Olivia find you? You shouldn't run off like that. - You knew the gender of the baby? - I am sick of arguing with you over things that don't matter. - No, you don't get to do that. What is going on with you? You're going behind my back. You're making shit up, you're lying straight to my face. - I have only ever done what I thought was best for you. - [Lauren] Yeah, you wanna know what's best for me? I want you in the guest room. - Lauren. - Stop it, Anthony, you're not allowed to do that. I'm serious, I'm done. (haunting orchestral music) - (shrieking) I am done with this! (objects clattering) (tense orchestral music) (head thudding repeatedly) (intense dramatic music) (Julie gasping fearfully) (door unlocking) (door clicking) - Hey, Julie. (gentle orchestral music) Do you think this looks convincing? I need Lauren to take poor little me in. - Lauren will never fall for that. - No, Julie, she already has. (door clicking) (door thudding) (gentle orchestral music) - Olivia, hey. - Hey. - Listen, I'm really sorry about earlier for blowing up at you like that, I, it's been a really stressful time lately, I'm sorry. - That's okay, totally forgiven. (soft tense music) - Olivia, what happened? What? Who did this to you? - [Olivia] My boyfriend. Can I stay here a couple of nights? (sobbing) - [Lauren] Yeah, no, of course. Oh, I'm so sorry. You can stay in the guest room. - The guest room I'm supposed to be staying in? - We have a couch. You're staying. - Thank you. (sobbing) - Of course. (soft ominous music) (zipper whirring) Anthony will go with you in the morning to get your things. - [Olivia] Oh, you two are heaven set. - No, I'm just, I'm glad you're not leaving. - Yeah, me too. Oh, Lauren, do you have anywhere, that I could get cleaned up tonight, and maybe have a shower? - I can get the guest bathroom set up for you, but feel free to pop over to our en suite tonight. - Thank you so much. - [Lauren] Get a good sleep. - [Olivia] You too. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (soft tense music) (soft tense music continues) (soft tense music continues) (soft tense music continues) Hello, Mrs. Campbell. (soft ominous music) - [Lauren] Are you doing okay in there, Olivia? - Oh, yep. I'm ah, just finishing up. (soft tense orchestral music) - With everything we talked about, I'm worried about you not taking your prescription. You've lost 5% of your body weight, which is the threshold for hospitalization with hyperemesis, and you're still vomiting. - But the meds make me feel so groggy, I can barely move and the tiredness is excessive, I feel like I'm sleepwalking. - That's a common side effect. At this point, bed rest is good for you. - Well, I also feel like I'm fighting my antidepressants and my anxiety just keeps rising and it just keeps getting worse and worse the more I can't think clearly. - Well, your electrolytes are all over the place, which exacerbates the anxiety. - And new mothers are often anxious, right? - Justifiably. - Yeah, I understand, Dr. Nelson, thank you. But I actually don't think that I need extra medication. - Let's just give it one more week, okay? - Yeah? (gentle melodic music) - Okay. - [Anthony] It'll all be okay. (tense orchestral music) (tense orchestral music continues) (pill bottle clattering) (Olivia humming) (gentle orchestral music) - Good morning. - Oh, good morning. (drawer thudding quietly) I put pineapple in it, you should try it. - You know, you don't have to keep making these, if it's too much. - If you like them, I will always keep making them. (zipper whirring) - Well, I would love to stay with you today, but building a practice from the ground up takes diligence. So duty calls. (melodic piano music) (melodic piano music continues) (soft ominous music) (Lauren groaning softly) (Lauren thudding to floor) (glass shattering) (melodic piano music) (melodic piano music continues) (soft tense music) (soft tense music continues) - [Lauren] What time is it? - Late. I'm just having a shower, I'll sleep on the couch. - I need some water. Baby? (shower running) (Lauren groaning softly) (gentle haunting music) (gentle haunting music continues) (Lauren groaning softly) (gentle haunting music) Olivia, what are you doing? - I'm a sucker for a late night snack. Can I get you something? - [Lauren] You can't be walking around the house like that, it's inappropriate. - It's late, I didn't think anyone would be awake. - It doesn't matter, it's inappropriate. I have a husband. (knife zinging) (soft tense music) - [Olivia] Your husband has more restraint than that. You can trust him, can't you? - This is my home, I'm not asking. - You're right. (soft tense music) (knife clattering) (soft tense music) (soft melodic music) - Good morning, Lauren. (Lauren groaning softly) - Oh, I don't, oh, I don't feel good. - Well, maybe you just need something to eat. (Lauren groaning loudly) (soft tense music) - (gasping) What happened? - Hey, your water broke. The hospitals won't admit you, until you're three or four centimeters dilated. That's okay, 'cause I'll be here with you every step of the way. - Where's Anthony? - He's having breakfast, I'll let him know. But you should just try and rest and eat something if you can. - (groaning) I can't, no, I can't, I can't. - You need your strength. - Okay. - Okay? - Oh! Ah, ow, oh! - [Olivia] Have some more. - No. (Lauren breathing heavily) (soft ominous music) (gentle haunting music) (soft tense orchestral music) (Lauren sobbing) (gentle orchestral music) (soft tense orchestral music) (gentle orchestral music) (Lauren gasping softly) (Lauren groaning) (Lauren gasping) (soft tense orchestral music) (Lauren groaning) (Lauren gasping) (soft tense orchestral music) (Lauren groaning) (Lauren gasping) (soft tense orchestral music) (Lauren gasping) (soft tense orchestral music) (Lauren groaning) (Lauren gasping) (soft tense orchestral music) - Congratulations, baby, we're gonna be parents, but you should be in bed resting. - No, I saw you. - Saw me what? - Cut the shit. You know what I'm talking about, I saw you. (eerie tense music) - Baby. Baby, you don't look good. (Lauren groaning) Hey, hey, hey, you need to lie down. I'll go get Olivia. - No. I don't want her anywhere near me. I want her out of the house. - She's gonna keep our baby safe, Lauren, we need her. (Lauren groaning loudly) (Lauren screaming) - She's 10 centimeters dilated. I-I think it's time for her to push now. - You need to breathe with me, in, out. (breathing deeply) In. (both inhaling deeply) Out. (both exhaling heavily) You need to push, Lauren. - Why-why aren't you taking me to the hospital? - [Anthony] There's no time, honey, this baby is coming now. - Oh, God! (groaning loudly) Oh, God, I can't, I can't do this, I can't. - Yes, you can, you have us, we can do this together. Now push. (tense orchestral music) (Lauren groaning loudly) - Oh, he's coming. Our baby is coming. Okay. - Okay. - One more time. Here we go. Ready? Push! (tense orchestral music) (Lauren groaning loudly) (melodic orchestral music) (melodic orchestral music continues) (baby crying) - My baby. (sobbing happily) (baby crying) (soft orchestral music) - [Olivia] Okay, I'm gonna go finish cleaning him up. Why don't you stay with Dad. - No, where is she, where's she taking our baby? - Everything is okay. - No, where's she going? What's she doing with our baby? - Just calm down, Lauren, just calm down. - What's she's doing with our baby? - Calm down, honey. Hey, hey. I'll go get him, okay? - No. - I'll go get him. I'll be right back. - Don't go, don't go. - I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get him. - Don't go, please. - I'm gonna go get him. I'll be right back. - No. - I'll be right back. - No. (soft orchestral music) (soft orchestral music continues) (baby crying) - Hello, Mercy General Hospital. - Hi, my name is Olivia Wright, I just gave birth at home and I'm wondering how I can get a birth certificate. - [Hospital Worker] Congratulations, Olivia. You'll need to fill out a certificate of live birth and register it with the Department of Vital Records within the next 10 days. - Okay, thank you. - [Hospital Worker] If you have any questions with the paperwork, come into the hospital, we can help you with everything. - Thanks so much, I'll be sure to come in. (baby crying) (soft orchestral music) - You looked that information up weeks ago. - Yes, but now there's a record of a phone call with my voice on it and this little guy's cries in the background. - Clever. - I'll be sure to bring him into the hospital too. The more people that see me with him, the better. - Yeah. - Here. - Oh, hey. - Watch his head. (soft orchestral music) - How's our baby, is everything okay? - Everything is great. Now he's just stopped struggling. Olivia took him to get cleaned up is all. - Oh, my gosh, baby, hi, baby. Oh, he's beautiful. - He's perfect. - Yeah, he is. I checked all his vitals, he's strong and healthy. - Have you thought of a name? - Oh, I don't know yet, I just was so excited to meet him. - Well, there's plenty of time for that. (laughs) Um, do you mind if I get a photo? - Ah, yeah. - Great. (camera clicking) Great. (camera clicking) (gentle melodic music) (soft ominous music) (gentle melodic music) (baby crying) - Oh. It's okay. Baby, it's okay. Hi. Good morning. (soft melodic music) (soft ominous music) (soft melodic music) (soft melodic music continues) - Hey, Mama Bear. (soft ominous music) - You are so full of shit. - What? - I saw you walking through my house naked again. - I was just using your en suite bathroom, because the drain in the guest bathroom was clogged. - I want you out. Thank you for your services, but your work here is done. Thank you, bye, leave. - Have you been taking your medication? Here. - Get out of my house! (cup clattering) (soft orchestral music) - Why would I leave my own house? - Your house? (glass shattering) (Olivia screaming) - Oh, my God! Don't touch him. - What is going on? - I came into the kitchen and Lauren had Liam underneath the sink. I think she was trying to drown him. - What? - And then I tried to take him away and she threw a glass at me. - You bitch! She's lying, I would never hurt our child. Why is she calling him Liam? - Anthony, check her pill bottle, it's almost empty. - Anthony, get her outta this house. - [Olivia] I think she's been over medicating. - No, I- - Lauren. - Okay, I would never hurt our child. Anthony, hey, look at me, I would never hurt him. You can't believe this. I don't, I don't know how those got in there. I have not been taking those. - I can't believe you tried to hurt our child. - She's lying! - Clearly, it's gone too far. - Anthony. - What, are you gonna try to tell me that I'm lying now too? I mean, you've been off lately, always sleeping, accusing me of random things. No, I just didn't wanna believe it. - What are you doing? (cellphone ringing) - Hello, Dr. Nelson. - Please. (soft tense music) Anthony, please. - Anthony Campbell. - No, stop. - Yeah, I think it is time. (gentle orchestral music) (door clicking) - Please, please help me. - I'll be right behind you. - Please, please. (sobbing) - Thank you so much for seeing to this personally, Detective Brooks. - She'll be taken to a psychiatric ward for 72 hours, put on a 5150 mental health hold. - Thank you. (car doors clicking) (car doors thudding) (soft ominous music) (gentle orchestral music) (gentle orchestral music continues) (soft ominous music) (door clicking) (gentle orchestral music) - How's my son? Has anyone checked on him? - He's safe at home. You have a call waiting. (gentle orchestral music) (gentle orchestral music continues) - Hello. - Hi, Lauren. (soft ominous music) - Why are you doing this? - You know I never wanted a baby. It's a shame that Liam is so breakable. - Please, please don't hurt him, I will do whatever you want. - Sweet little Liam is motivation enough, isn't he? But I also have your friend. (soft ominous music) - Julie? - Hm, he looks just like his daddy. - He's perfect. (sighing happily) And so are you. (Olivia laughing) She'll be back after three days. That's as long as they can hold her involuntarily. - The plan's going to work. - [Anthony] And then we'll be forever. (soft tense music) - [Detective Brooks] How are you feeling today? - I need you to believe me, Detective, please. I would never hurt my son. Olivia is making this entire thing up. - I wanna believe you, but I need to get a better understanding of what's happening under your roof. - She's trying to take over my life. She's trying to steal my husband, steal my baby. I saw them kissing, I saw her leave my bedroom. I just, please, she's making this up to make me seem crazy. - Hey. So listen, any frantic or unstable behavior's just gonna make them keep you in here longer. So you need to calm down. - Calm, calm down? I can't calm down. There is a crazy woman who has my baby, has my best friend. I have no way of knowing if they're even okay. I can't, I can't breathe in here. - All right. (gentle upbeat music) Let me do a little research, see if I can put your mind at ease. Where did you meet Olivia? - I met her through the hospital midwife program. - Had you met her before? - No. - Full name? - Olivia Wright. - Okay. Let me dig into this and see what I can come up with. - Thank you. - Try to get some rest. (soft upbeat music) (gentle melodic music) - Hi. Could I make a call? - You get one call per day, make it count. (soft orchestral music) - Okay. Hi, Rachel, it's me, Lauren. Anthony put me on a psychiatric hold, I need your help. (elevator dinging) (elevator door rumbling) (soft orchestral music) Thank you so much for coming here. - What are you doing in this place? - Long story short, Anthony thinks I'm crazy and he's locked me up in here. I thought I could trust him, but it's like I don't even know who he is. - And I can't believe you ever trusted him after what he did. - What does that mean? - You don't know? I thought you talked to him. - Know what? - Anthony was fired for sexual misconduct with students. This was weeks ago, just before we met the first time. - Who filed the charges? - I did. - What? - I didn't know he was married, but I rejected him. I just wasn't interested. Then he got angry, manipulative, threatened to fail me if I didn't sleep with him. He gassed me, he said he would get my scholarship revoked. - Get good grades. - [Rachel] I wish I'd told someone sooner. (soft tense orchestral music) - When he first came on to me in our therapy sessions, I thought I was special. I, I didn't realize. I am so sorry. What made you finally come forward? - He started doing the same thing to another girl. My old TA, Olivia. - Olivia Wright? (soft tense orchestral music) He's known her the entire time? What? - Olivia took an interest in my thesis over the year. Doing such a good job, I really appreciate it. Anthony was never my teacher, I'd been seeing him as a guidance counselor. I referred Olivia to him. She was going through a really tough time. - Hi, Olivia, TA? - Yeah. - I'm Anthony. - Nice to meet you. - Very nice to meet you too. I'm a professor here. - (sobbing) Sorry. - No, please. Hey, hey. It's gonna be okay. Do you trust me? - Olivia, it's wrong! He's a faculty member and he's manipulating you. - You're just jealous that he loves me and not you. - Olivia! (soft orchestral music) Our friendship never recovered. Then when Anthony was fired, she vanished. That's why I was in his office that day, I was trying to find out where Olivia went, if she was okay. - Olivia is our midwife, Anthony is the one who convinced me to hire her and she's the one who convinced him I was crazy and he believed her, I can't believe he was in on it. I, they're working together? (soft orchestral music) Can you break into a laptop? - Why? - My friend, Julie, she had a security doorbell and I think something really bad has happened to her and I'm afraid that Anthony and Olivia are responsible for it. - Well, I probably could. Where's it? - It's under my bed in my bedroom. Try the doors off the bedroom patio, he usually sleeps with them open and forgets to lock them. - Okay. - You don't think I'm crazy, right? You believe me? - I do believe you and if nobody else believes us, maybe we need to serve him some justice ourselves. - I'm sorry, visiting hours are over. - But I'm in, I'll call when I have the laptop. (haunting orchestral music) (door clicking) (soft upbeat music) (soft upbeat music continues) (soft upbeat music continues) (soft upbeat music continues) (muffled Olivia laughing) (soft upbeat music) (soft upbeat music continues) (soft upbeat music continues) (soft tense music) (Rachel gasping softly) (soft upbeat music) (soft tense music) (soft ominous music) (soft tense orchestral music) - What did you say to her? - I told her everything that happened between us. Let me out, Anthony. (soft ominous music) - I can't let you leave. (intense orchestral music) (baby crying quietly) - Hello. I had an at-home birth and I was hoping you could review my request for a birth certificate. (baby crying quietly) (soft tense music) (muffled baby crying quietly) (soft tense music) (muffled baby crying quietly) (soft tense music) (muffled baby crying quietly) (door handle rattling) (hand thudding) - Please! Somebody's got my baby, please! (hand thudding) (haunting orchestral music) (baby crying quietly) Please, please. (sobbing) That's my baby. Please, my baby's in there, I can hear my baby, please. - Ssh! - No, I can hear my baby. - Ssh! (Lauren sobbing) (haunting orchestral music) (car rumbling quietly) - [Rachel] What are you doing? You're a professor, not a murderer. - [Anthony] You saw to it, that I would never be a professor again. You're the reason my life is falling apart. - [Rachel] You just had a beautiful baby, you don't wanna do this, just let me go. I promise I won't say anything. (soft ominous music) - You've made that promise before and we both know you can't keep it. (intense ominous music) (gun firing) (car door clicking) (heart beating) (car door thudding) (haunting orchestral music) (haunting orchestral music continues) (haunting orchestral music continues) (water splashing) (haunting orchestral music) (elevator dinging) (elevator doors rumbling) (soft tense music) - Hi. I'm here to speak to Rachel Davis. (keyboard tapping) - Sorry, she was only conscious for half an hour and even if she was still awake, she's really in no place to give a statement. - All right, thank you. Actually, there's one more thing, I'd like to talk to you about your midwife services, in particular, Olivia Wright. - I'm not familiar with her name. Let me look her up. (keyboard tapping) Doesn't look like anyone by that name is registered with our midwife program. - Are you sure, W-R-I-G-H-T? (keyboard tapping) - Sorry, nope. - Okay, thanks. (soft tense music) - I don't believe you're currently a danger to yourself or others. Now it would be my advice for you to continue your stay with us. - I wanna go home. - Well, that is your right. I'll have to note that it was against medical advice. And your medications? - I'll have Anthony give them to me every day. I know the drill, Dr. Nelson, I just, I need, I need to go home. (gentle orchestral music) - Mrs. Campbell, you're released from the hold. - Thank you. - Should I call your husband? (soft orchestral music) - Yeah. - Are you absolutely sure you can't keep her in here longer? I'm worried that she'll try to hurt herself or the baby again. - 72 hours is the longest we can do for an involuntary hold. Monitor her, if you notice any erratic behavior, just give me a call. - Right. - It may be time to talk about you claiming power of attorney. I'll go get her now. - Thanks. Dr. Nelson, I can hold onto that for you. - Of course. (bag rustling) (soft tense orchestral music) (soft tense orchestral music continues) (bag rustling) (soft tense music) - Darling. (soft tense music) - Thank you. - Hi. - Where's our son? - At home with Olivia. - Tell me where Julie is. I will leave you, Olivia and the baby alone. You'll never hear from me again, just tell me where she is. - Now, I'm glad you finally realized what's best for you. Come on. (gentle melodic music) (elevator dinging) Take it easy. (soft tense orchestral music) (elevator door rumbling) (door clicking) (door thudding) (soft ominous music) - I just need to grab my things and then I will go. But I need to say goodbye to my baby. - So you're finally starting to see some reason? - Tell me where Julie is and I will leave you two alone forever. That's it, you'll never see me again. - [Olivia] I don't think she can be trusted with Liam. - Please, I just need five minutes. - I'll be right outside the door. (bag rustling) (soft haunting music) - Hi. Hi, baby. Hi. (gentle melodic music) It's okay, your daddy loves you. He'd never do anything to hurt you, you're gonna be safe. You're gonna be safe until I'm back, okay. It's okay. (baby crying) I love you so much. I love you so much. (sobbing) You're gonna be okay. Mommy's gonna come back, you're gonna be safe. (gentle melodic music) - Is she dead? (soft tense music) - Is who dead? - Your new little friend, Rachel was shot, some kind of carjacking, apparently, a horrible accident. - You're a monster. - Rachel's dead? - [Anthony] Hospitalized. I'm sure she won't make it through the night. - [Lauren] Where's Julie? - She's at your mother's old cabin. If only you would've dealt with your grief a little sooner, you might have been able to find her. (soft upbeat music) Exactly as we knew she would. - We should get going, we don't wanna be too far behind. - [Olivia] Hm-hm. (soft upbeat music) (car rumbling quietly) (car door clicking) (car door thudding) (soft upbeat music) (door clicking) (gentle orchestral music) - Julie? (muffled Julie groaning loudly) Julie? Julie, it's okay. (chain rattling) It's okay, I'm here. I'm gonna get... (soft tense orchestral music) (Lauren grunting) (ax thudding) (chain rattling) (Julie sobbing) Julie. Julie. - Oh, thank God you're all right. - I'm sorry I didn't come sooner. I can't believe they did this to you. - Lauren, Anthony, I saw him with her, with Olivia. He was cheating and I should have said something. - It's okay. - But you just seemed so happy and I didn't wanna ruin everything for you. Before I could fix it all, he took me and locked me up in here. - Anthony's the one who took you? - At first, then it's been Olivia ever since. I have no idea why they're keeping me here. (car rumbling quietly) (gasps) Oh, my God. Oh God, it's her. - It's okay. Pretend that you're still tied up. - Okay, okay, okay. - I'll be right back. - Be careful. (rapid tense music) (both grunting) (blows thudding) (kick thudding) - Bitch! (blow thudding) - Uh! (Lauren thudding to floor) (tense dramatic music) Get off! - No. (tense dramatic music) I've been looking forward to this. - No! (loud ominous music) (blow thudding) (eerie tense music) (Lauren breathing heavily) - I said I would leave you alone. That was part of the deal, if you let me save Julie, I would leave you alone. (gentle melodic music) I'm calling the police. - Actually, we're gonna be calling Dr. Nelson. It's pretty messed up for you to hold Julie hostage in your cabin. But now we understand, why you didn't want Anthony coming up here. It's a shame that your depression got this bad, killing your friend and yourself at your mother's cabin. - He's never gonna believe you. (gentle melodic music) - Won't he? You're the only one with the psychiatric record and a history of harm. - We knew that you would come running here without thinking as soon as you found out that your friend was in danger. You played right into our hands. - Anthony, we have a son. Can you really live with yourself? - We've been over for a long time. - How long have you been planning this? - That doesn't matter. - [Lauren] How long? - Ever since my heart met its other half. - Anthony, stop. Anthony, stop. Anthony, you shot Rachel and then you put our son in danger. - I was never gonna let anything happen to Liam. (soft tense music) That was all I ever wanted, to be a father, you knew that. We tried, for years and nothing. And then I finally meet someone perfect and all of a sudden, you're pregnant, (sighing) and I have to put up with you for another nine months. (soft tense music) At least I won't have to put up with you for the rest of my life. (Lauren sobbing) Olivia will make a better mother than you ever would. - You will never be my son's mother, never! - According to the paperwork, I already am. - What? - When I met Anthony, we both knew that we were meant to be together. I ran away from Weston for him. - You know, Rachel was worried about you. She was worried something bad happened to her friend. What would she think of you now? - I did what I had to do, I made my own perfect little life. You had it all, a beautiful house, a gorgeous husband, a perfect little life. And then you ruined it all. What a waste, sitting around moping. I know that I have it because I deserve it. (soft tense music) (Lauren breathing heavily) - What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do now? - This. (tense ominous music) - No, no, Anthony! No, no, no, no, no! (noose creaking) No, Anthony! No! (rope creaking) (Olivia grunting) (soft tense music) (footsteps thudding) (Julie roaring) (Olivia thudding to floor) - Uh! (tense dramatic music) (blow thudding) - Uh! (Anthony thudding) (Julie choking) - Uh! Just die! (tense dramatic music) (Julie choking) (blow thudding) Uh! - Olivia, this is over for good. - [Officer] Mrs. Campbell, your son is waiting for you in the car directly out front. (soft orchestral music) (car door clicking) - Baby, hi. It's okay, Mommy's here. It's okay, hi, Mommy's here. It's okay, hi. Mommy's here. (soft orchestral music) - Lauren Campbell. I don't know if I should congratulate you on your bravery or apologize for your circumstance. I deeply apologize, I'm sorry I didn't take your concerns more serious when you first voiced them. (soft orchestral music) - Is Julie gonna be okay? - She's in rough shape, but I think she'll be okay. - And what's gonna happen to them? - Well, Anthony will be charged with first degree attempted murder and conspiracy and Olivia will be charged with everything from impersonating a midwife, kidnapping, abuse, and attempted murder. They have a long stay in prison ahead of them. - It's okay. Is there any update on Rachel? - Looks like she's gonna pull through. - Oh, thank God. You might wanna let Olivia know. (soft orchestral music) - Why? - They were friends once. - [Detective Brooks] Do you think she'll care? - Maybe. - Okay. - It's okay, hi. (soft orchestral music) - Lauren wants you to know that Rachel is alive. (Olivia sobbing) (gentle orchestral music) (Olivia sobbing) (gentle orchestral music) - Nobody's ever gonna hurt you. (gentle orchestral music) (soft orchestral music) One, two, three. Oh. - So do we finally get to know what name you decided on? - His name is Bailey. (Julie gasps) - Just like your mother. That's so beautiful. Hi there. - Suits him. - Yeah. (laughing) (soft orchestral music)
