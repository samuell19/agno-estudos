(screaming) (tense music) - Did you get it done? - Yeah, I got it done. - Alright, so what's up? - I was able to get around the subpoena but it wasn't easy, Darien. - I know it wasn't easy, is it done? - Its done, okay. And Darien, if you want to keep your little basketball scholarship, I suggest you stay out of trouble. - You sure its a good idea for you go on this trip? - Yeah, what harm would it do? I mean, I'm just ready to get out of this place. There's just too much going on. - I'm worried about you. Just be safe, aight? - Thanks for being concerned. - I got you, aight. - Alright. - This trip is gonna be so much fun. - Yeah I've been kinda waiting for this. - Let me get that. Hey, where's Travis? - He's drunk. - What do you mean? (mumbling) Alright well, let's just go get him. Here we come, Travis. (low eerie music) * Daddy was a savage * Eat your flesh and your bones * * He was a savage - Are you okay? - Oh yeah. I'm fine. - Are we there yet? - Soon hopefully. What are you doing? - What? How bout we ask her if she knows where we're going? - Are you freaking kidding me? She's walking a fake fucking dog. Let's just keep going. - Who knows, she probably knows where it is since she is from around here. Look at her. - Miss? Excuse me. Miss, excuse me. - Hey, lady. - God damn it. Shit. - Miss. - Get on my motherfucking nerves this bullshit. - Hey lady. Excuse me. Me and my buddies we're going to a cabin, do you know where that could be? (woman shouting) Somewhere near Alpine Lake. - Motherfucker! This right here. (tense dramatic music) - Hey, is there something wrong with you? - Do you know the directions? - No I don't want to fucking (mumbles). - Okay dude, just go. - Thank you. * Daddy was a savage * Eat your flesh and your bones * * Daddy was a savage * The sun goes down * Make no mistakes * You better be careful * Out by Alpine Lake * They're searching * They're seeking * For their next prey * They catch you * Eat you up * Nice piece of steak * Body parts * In Alpine Lake * Alpine Lake Alpine Lake * Daddy was a savage * Eat your flesh and your bones * * He was a savage * Daddy was a savage - Now see that shit, Brad? That's exactly what I'm talking about. That's what's wrong with this place. Fucking young ins coming up here with their goddamn electric cars and their bubble gum flavored cigarettes and their fucking mocha frappuccino. What the hell is this world coming to? (gags and spits) the fuck you put in here, Brad? This lighter fluid? Jesus. You gonna set the whole forest on fire. - Well, here it is. - What? - Our guest house is bigger than this dump. - Oh my god. Raise your hand if you don't give a shit about Travis's guest house. - Not by unanimous decision, your honor. That's cause we have a good time in that guest house. - We sure did. A real good time. - I think its nice. - You mean nicer than that one room flat that we picked you up at? That place isn't hard to top. - Travis, keep running your mouth and your first case is gonna be as a victim and not a lawyer. - Hey man, what's up with you all of a sudden? - What do you mean? - I don't know, ever since you've gotten back from college you're just different. - Well Harvard makes a man a lot more confident. - Babe, I like when you're confident. - Thanks baby. - Just remember why we're here, okay. We're here for Monica. - You said you guys weren't a thing anymore. - We aren't. - Damn. - This is really nice. - Let's go see where the rooms are at. - This place is a dump. - Hey guys, there's a hot tub. - What? I know where I'm staying. - Yeah, me too. Travis. (soft rock music) - Babe, there. - Okay. - You know your dumb ass could be helping me over here. What the hell are you doing anyway with your hand out, you jerking off an invisible Sasquatch? Get the hell down here and help me, you lazy son of a bitch. (soft rock music) - Oh my god. The bathroom is so nice. Babe, we can have some serious fun in the tub later. - I should of been in charge of this. I would of found a much better cabin. Beds that don't squeak. - Do you want to hear what real squeaking sounds like? - Oddly I do. - You're gonna have to wait till tonight to find out. - This weekend was to release tension not create more of it. - So uh, anyone up for a drink? - Oh me. - How many bottles have you broken in your illustrious career? - Well. Enough to do this. (laughs) - Nice. - Show off. - Well hello there, pretty lady. I haven't seen you here before. - Hi. - So what can I get you? - Let me get a jack and coke. Matter of fact, make that a virgin. - Ballsy. You heard that, Kat? She likes to drink just like you, virgin. Come on everybody, lets get this party started. We came here to party our asses off and release some of the pressures of school. - Pressure? What do you know about pressure? Your dad owns like one of the largest law firms in LA. You're set for life, dick head. - Best chicks in the world are from LA. - Jimmy, really? Come on, don't be a douce like Travis. I mean I know you both of you think with your smaller head but come on. - Not me. I also think with my wallet and my money and making more money. Which is why I'm only taking on rich clients once I pass the bar. - What? Rich clients. Everybody deserves a good attorney. You must really only be worried about your wallet. - Looks who talking, miss law school and now pre med. Money talks, bullshit walks, honey. - Tell em, babe. You can't buy no Bentley and go on shopping sprees in Paris representing poor ass people. - Is that why you went to law school, for the money? - [Both] Hell yeah. - Unreal. - I'll be right back. Hey dad, what's up? - Hey dad, what's up? Oh you ran out of toilet paper? Oh that's alright. I'll still kiss your ass anyway. Oh you had to use 100 dollar bills? Think you can wire them to me afterwards? Awesome. (laughs) - Idiot. - He's such a tool. - What's that? - Let's see. What's he doing? - I don't know. - Hi. - You okay? Mm-hmm. You sure? Alright. - Get in here. - What's that for? - Cell phone detox. - No. Babe, don't. - We're miles away from the city. - I don't care. I need to be available. This is important. Hey! - If Kat can miss her MMA paper views you can go without your cellphone for a couple days. - Objection. - Overruled. When you're in LA and we see you on TV for defending rich celebrities for, I don't know, jay walking and drunk driving, we'll let you use your cellphone then. Until then, shut up. - When I'm in LA taking on those big clients, I won't be hanging around you losers. - Thanks. - Not you, bro. - You know what, Travis? In this case, you pray to God the original daddy hurries up and makes you a partner in his law firm. - These are disappearing until Sunday night. - Isn't there supposed to be a caretaker around here? - Yeah I think I saw him chopping firewood earlier. - Who gives a shit about him. We don't need him. Come on, let's get this party started. - Oh. - Well um. No training for three days so I'm gonna go for a run. - I don't get it. You really like getting into the ring? - I like kicking ass, what can I say? - Um only men should fight. - I'm all for girls fighting. Chicks fighting but with pillows and jello. - Or chocolate. - I love it. I got 500 on Kat. I'm sorry babe but look at her. She's got more muscles than I do. - You know what, Travis? Maybe I should practice my skills on your face? - That would be such a quick fight. - I don't fight chicks. I only screw them. - That's a good thing cause she would kick your ass. - You know what, he's got a point. Two hits. Me hitting Travis's face and Travis hitting the floor. - Y'all didn't know Kat is part dude? Which bathroom do you use? - Travis, shut up. - You're one tough bitch. - I mean do you feel anything towards women like I don't know, respect? - No, not at all. - Ew. You're really a fucking pig. (oinking) - You should say, a really rich freaking pig. - Its not funny, Travis. - Oh please. How bout you just sit there and look pretty and don't say nothing? - Travis! Oh my god, you really are a disgusting rich little pig and if you say anything like that to her again, I'm gonna whoop your ass. - I'm going out for a smoke. - Amanda, come on. Don't demean yourself. You gotta stick up for yourself. I mean you could do a lot better than Travis. - These chicks are a trip. - I like them. They seem pretty cool. - Well you are a blonde. - Travis? Why are you always treat me like this? I've done nothing wrong to you. - You're a good screw, babe. Plenty of trim would love for me to show them some attention. Count yourself lucky that I even talk to you. Let alone showcase you around as my girl. - Cool. (door slams) (thunder crashes) - Dude, that was cold. - The hell with her. She knows her place. - So you're working your way through school, right? - Well yeah. I've been working since I was a freshman. Me and my mom. My dad passed away when I was four. So its just been me and her ever since. - She sounds like a great woman. - Well she was and she was my best friend. She died last year. - Well. I'm sure she's looking down on you and is extremely proud. I mean, pre law now medical school, all on your own. That's incredible. - Yeah but what's incredible you are incredible. Dropping out of school, running your dad's garage. That's ultimate boss shit right there. - I mean, I like kicking ass. When I'm in the ring, I kinda tune out the world. Whether its five minutes or 10 minutes. That's where I'm just focused on nothing else but me and task at hand and just giving the best damn fight that I can. - Yeah well you sure did impress me. - Girl, please. You impress me. - I don't know how you do it. All this training and weightlifting for what, to get a black eye and like four minutes in the ring. - Like I said, I like kicking ass but you know what? You lost your dad when you were four and you work two jobs to help your mom make ends meet and now med school. I mean. Strength isn't a muscle thing. You're a tough girl, too. - I really don't think so but thanks for saying that anyway. - Well I'm gonna go make myself a kale shake. Do you want one? - Hell no. That sounds disgusting. That's like ultimate badassdom right there. Kale shake? What is your stomach made of titanium? - Badassdom, huh? I like it. Its actually pretty good and obviously its really good for you. You should try it. Its a lot better than it sounds, believe me. - Yeah okay. - So you think there any bears and shit out there? - Probably all types of bears and mountain lions out there. - You think the girls know about it? - For what? I'm sure Kat could kick some bear ass with her MMA ass. - True. - How in the hell do you put up with Travis? - Yeah, he's such a douche. - He's really not that bad its just more of a show than anything, you know what I mean? - Yeah but Amanda wouldn't that be more of a reason to leave his ass alone? - Yeah I mean he has no respect for women whatsoever. - You guys, he's not that bad. What? (woman chanting) (low eerie music) - If she starts cutting off chicken's heads and shit, that's it, we're out of here. (low eerie music) (woman chanting) - Looks like some crazy shit voodoo shit, you guys. - Okay, I think its time to go. - Yeah, yeah. (woman chanting) - This feels so good. Oh my god, my legs are like killing me right now. (tense music) - This is perfect. This is exactly what I needed. We only were walking. What the fuck? What was that? Did you guys see that? - No, I think you're tripping. - No I'm not. - No I saw something. - I'm not tripping. There was something there or someone there. - Well there's nothing there right now. - Okay, well I'm gonna sit right here. - Whatever. That's a lot of freaky shit that we've been seeing. Especially that lady in the woods. What's up with it? - Yeah that was some creepy shit. - Creepy no. More like psychotic. - I'm trying to relax here and yeah now I only can think about her and whatever I just saw. Never even seen anything like that in my life, ever. - Yeah looked like some kind of African ritual or something. - You guys are overreacting. That crazy ass lady can keep her crazy ass in the woods. (woman chanting) (airplane flying overhead) (tense dramatic music) (knock at door) - Who the hell could that be? - Maybe it's Kat? - What? No one's there. (knocking) What the hell's going on here? (low eerie music) (leaves crunching) - Hey what do you say we order a pizza? - Sounds good to me but someone took my phone, remember? - Wait, wait, wait. Can we get meat lovers? - Sure. I'm gonna go ask Monica. Do you know where she is? - In her bedroom. Now's your chance, Romeo. - It's really not what you think. - Oh you so you wouldn't mind if I? That's what I thought. (knocking) - I uh. Just wanted to see if you'd like some pizza. - Sounds good to me, thanks. Anything else? - No. (soft uplifting music) (insects chirping) (knocking) (low eerie music) (tense dramatic music) - Uh Travis? - Extra large pizzas here. - About damn time. - 25.24. - You take credit cards? Sure. - You kids up here alone? - No, God is with us. God is everywhere. - I'll be right back. - He better not be charging shit with my card or copying my info. I'm not tipping him. - Hey man, this card didn't work. - That's impossible. Try it again. - I ran it two times. - Whatever. Jimmy, do you have any cash on you? Probably just my dad being an ass. - Don't worry. My treat, mister big shot. - Hey you kids be safe up here. People have been known to go missing around there's parts at Alpine Lake. (eerie music) - what the fuck? - What do you see? - I just saw a guy standing right there staring at the house. Its like he was watching us or something. - This is crazy. He's completely gone. - Fuck it. Let's get back. (tense dramatic music) - Jesus. - Well you're close. If I could just master that whole water into wine thing. - What the hell are you doing out here? - And why the hell are you spying on us, old man? - Sorry to frighten you pretty little ladies. My name is Walter, I'm the groundskeeper of the property y'all been staying at. - We didn't call you. So why are you hanging around our place? - Cause he's a creep, that's why. - Your place? This here is my place. - What the hell are you talking about? - I'm the groundskeeper. Y'all are college students, right? You don't strike me as particularly bright. - We don't need your assistance this weekend, old man. - Well then y'all just have yourselves a fine weekend. - Let's get out of here. - Hey. You stay away from the cabin this weekend or else. - What happened? - The damn caretaker. - What the caretaker seriously has nothing better to do than try to scare us? What was he doing standing out there looking at us through the window? - He's an idiot, that's why - A little retarded. - It just doesn't make any sense, you guys. Why would he be trying to scare us? Maybe we should just leave. - Bullshit. We're not going nowhere. That old fart can kiss my ass. We're gonna party all weekend. - You know what, for once he's actually got a point. I mean come on Monica, we can't just leave because that old dude out there is a little off his rockers. - That dude is way off his rockers. - We don't have anything to worry about. Besides, I told him if he comes back around here again I'll kick his ass. Now can we eat? - I don't like this. - We'll be fine. Come on. (shouts) (screaming) (wet crunching) - That was pretty good. - Well Amanda made it, Travis. Why don't you tell her? - Yeah Travis, that would be nice of you. - No it's fine, I don't mind cooking at all. - It was very good. - No. He should tell you. - No seriously it's fine, I don't care. - That's bullshit. You need to tell her, Travis. - Okay, okay. You did good, dear. Real good. - Well hell I liked it. I'm getting another piece. - You really should dump this idiot, Amanda and get a real man. - A real man like who, you? I'm more man than you can handle, babe. - Oh yeah? We'll never know. I wouldn't want to. - Okay I'm gonna go get ready for bed. (groaning) (tense eerie music) - I always wanted to do this as a kid. - So why didn't you? - Well, my dad being a grease monkey and everything he just never wanted to do anything like this. If it didn't involve cars or gambling or alcohol he just wanted no part of it. - Well now you can cross this off your bucket list. - Yeah, you're right. - Hey Jimmy, can you hand me some marshmallow? - I got it. - Can I get a graham cracker and chocolate. - Chocolate, too? Alright. - Hey Travis, where's Amanda? - She's inside. - Yeah I wonder what you did to her. - I didn't do anything to her. - I'm sure you did something. - She seemed pretty upset. - Whatever, she knows her place - You're such a tool, Travis. Well at least you get to use a long stick once in your life. (mock laughter) - You know what, some things never change, Travis. (panting) (engine revving) (moaning) (eerie tense music) (tense dramatic music) (banging) - Hey. - Yeah? - Did you hear that? - Hear what? (banging) - That. - I'll go see what it is. - Did you guys hear that? - Yeah but what the fuck was it? - I don't know. (bang) - Did you guys hear that? - No, we all just had a craving for ice cream at the same time. - Maybe it was the creepy groundskeeper guy. - It really better not be. I already threatened to kick his ass. - Maybe it was the lady we saw in the woods earlier. - Yeah maybe she's coming to kill us and cook our bones but she figured she would knock first. - Why you always playing, Travis? - There's no one on the security monitor. - What's that? - Maybe that's not such a good idea. - That's definitely not a good idea. - What the hell? - Oh my God, is she alive? - I'm not sure. - What the fuck? Oh my God. What do you think happened to her? - It looks like she was stabbed. You guys, her pulse is really weak and her breathing is faint. - Stabbed? Who the fuck stabbed her? - Oh my God. I don't fucking know but you need to call 911 right the fuck now. - How? Someone took our phones remember. - I'll fucking get them! (phone beeping) - There's no dial tone. - I can't find the cellphones. They're not where I left them. - What the hell are we gonna do? I'm really fucking starting to get scared, I can't. - I don't know. - I don't know. - What? It's my back up. My back phone. Shit, no signal. - Let's get her to the van. We need to get her to the hospital. - You guys aren't coming? - Hell no. Harvard, remember? I can't wait to see how you sell this one to the cops. - Oh my God, Travis. - Where the fuck did he put them? - What are you looking for? - The cell phones, I got to find the cellphones. - Babe you're starting to worry me. Calm down. - Stop being so annoying! I'm sorry, babe. Baby. I'm sorry. Look, I'm just trying to get us out of here. My other phone has signal so if I can just find it we can get the hell out of here. Baby, open up. Open the door. - Wait. - Shit. - What, what? What's going on? - The wire's cut. - What? What the fuck? You mean to tell me we're stuck out here? - Oh my God, fuck. Oh my God. She's dead. She's dead! Guys she's dead. Shit. Oh my God. - Let's get inside. - What the fuck are we gonna do now? - I don't know but I really don't think it's a good idea that we're standing out here in the open. Let's go. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna kick his ass. - Yeah well maybe if we leave him alone he'll leave us alone. - I don't think that's a good idea. - Tell that to my car. - Travis, you're not gonna go with him? - For what? It ain't my car. Besides, I just took a nice relaxing pill to help calm my nerves. That old man Walter, come on, Jimmy should have no trouble kicking his ass. (eerie tense music) (urinating) (tense techno music) - Walter! Get your ass out here! Walter! Walter if you're back there, this isn't fucking funny. (tense techno music) - Travis! How 'bout you get your ass up and see what the hells going on out there? - How bout you take your UFC MMA ass out there? - You know what? Maybe I will. You really are an asshole, Travis. I'll go get him myself. - Wait, Kat. I'ma go, too. - Hey dear, can you make me a sandwich? - Seriously, make it yourself. (wet crunching) - Damn, Kat. We've been walking forever. - Just keep an eye out, okay? - Where in the hell could Jimmy be? - I don't know. Jimmy! Jimmy! That little bastard took all our phones but kept his. - But why would he, why would he just leave his phone here and walk off? That doesn't make any sense. - He wouldn't. - I wonder if he was able to call for help. - There's no signal. Dude, what is your problem? - My, my. Lovely young ladies. - What the hell did you do with our friend, shitbag? - Where the hell is Jimmy? - Your friend? - Yeah average looking guy with dark hair. - I ain't seen anybody. - Bullshit, old man. - Well ain't you just a feisty little thing. - Look you motherfucker, you need to tell us what you did with our friend right now or I'ma put my foot up your ass. - Oh you like it rough, too? Well good luck with that. - Alright, then. You better tell us what the hell you did with Jimmy. - Look, ain't seen your friend. I don't know where he is. Maybe he got hit in the head, got all dizzy and passed out somewhere. - Oh fine, fine. Well just see what the sheriff says about that. - Well good luck. Gonna take his fat ass more than an hour to get up this far. (tense dramatic music) (grunting) - What the hell, Kat? - Come on, help me get him inside. - And do what with him? - We're gonna tie him up and we're gonna beat some answers out of him. - My God, are you sure about this? - Yeah. - What about Jimmy? He's still out there somewhere. - Well. I don't know, maybe he's back at the house right now. - I sure hope so. Damn it, damn it, Kat! - God help you if you did anything to our friend. - This is bullshit. This is like the worst trip ever. You guys sure know how to ruin a trip. - This isn't good. Where could Jimmy be? - I don't know, okay. That guy over there definitely had something to do with it. I just fucking know it. - So what are we gonna do with him? - I don't know. This wasn't my idea. But by the way Kat looks, it can't be good. Shit I still don't have a signal. I'm gonna go out back to see if I can get some more bars. Stupid ass phone. Still aint got no damn signal. Here we go, here we go. Got one bar. - Where's Monica? - Monica? Monica, yo, Monica. Monica. - They're sending a car out, guys. But get this, they won't be here till the morning. There's only one officer on duty and he's all tied up. How ironic. - I'm not waiting around here till the morning. - Yeah what if Jimmy's still hurt? - I'm not leaving him out there. (grunts) - Where's our friend, asshole and what did you do with our cellphones? - Look pretty boy, I already told you I don't know where your goddamn friend is. - You're lying. - Sir, just tell us where our friend is and we'll let you go. (grunts) - I'm sick of playing games. - Look princess. - No, shut up. - Oh God damn. - I will cut you up piece by piece until you tell us where Jimmy is. - Look, princess, I told you. I don't know where your friend is. I was outside minding my own goddamn business. You knocked my out, dragged me in here tied me to this fucking chair. You know, I can't wait till the sheriff sees this cause I am pressing charges against all y'all. - You press charges on us? Get the hell out of here, you wacko. - He does have a point, Travis. Kidnapping, assault in the first degree. We're holding him against his will. - What about kidnapping our friend or worse, murder? - That's all circumstantial evidence at this point. - I say we torture his ass until he tells us where Jimmy is. - Why don't you just wait a second, Kat. Come on. Why don't we just talk this out and wait till the morning. When the sheriff comes we can sort everything out. - No, no I'm not leaving Jimmy out there. - I'm with Kat on this on. This prick is the only one who knows where Jimmy is. - I'm not waiting around here another minute longer. I'm leaving. - Where are you gonna go? The van is busted, remember? You're better off just waiting for the sheriff to arrive. - No, I'm gonna call a cab or an uber or a Lyft or something. (screaming) what the hell? - What just happened? - I don't know. - Is everyone okay? - What the hell just happened? - Oh my God, where did he go? - I don't know but I'm gonna go find him and Jimmy. - Hey if you didn't find him the first time what makes you think you're gonna find him now? - I have to try. I'm not just gonna leave Jimmy out there. - Wait, Kat, I'm gonna go with you. - No just. You'll slow me down, okay just. Just wait, no just wait here. Okay? Just in case he comes back. - Are you sure about this? Yes. - Yeah, keep all their crazy asses out. - You're not gonna go with her? - Waste of time. Jimmy's okay, he's probably just passed out somewhere. Kat already scared Walter shitless. So I don't think she'll have any trouble. - I'm out of here. - Where the fuck are you going? - I don't fucking know. - Does she not remember that the car doesn't work? - I think she's going, just in panic mode and not thinking clearly she's starting to lose it. (leaves crunching) - Where is she? Wait, I see Kat! She's coming, she's coming. Wait. I don't see Jimmy with her. (tense dramatic music) Kat get over here! (grunts) Kat get the fuck in the house now! - Just wait a minute. Not until I beat his ass. - Kat get in the house now! Kat, now. Get in the house. - Where's Amanda? - His crazy ass took her. Just sit here and let me grab something to clean you up. - What happened? Where's Mandy? - He took her! - Who took her? - We need to go after them. - You're in no condition to go anywhere. You just sit here and you be quiet. You have a concussion. And your nose is probably broken. - Wouldn't be the first time. - Look I think I stopped the bleeding. - Okay, well then I'm going after him. - No, you sit down. You're in on condition to go anywhere. - I have to. - I'm going to get Amanda and Jimmy. - No wait. - Jimmy's dead. - Lock the door behind me. (tense dramatic music) (leaves crunching) Hey. I'm here. Just be quiet, alright. Okay, just be quiet. I'm gonna get you out of here, alright. Just stay still. Almost done. Almost done, babe. Run. Stand back while I check it out. It's the pizza guy's car. (crickets chirping) Alright, I'll distract him while you get back to the cabin. - No, no babe. Just go back, it's just safer. - Take this. Go. Come on, motherfucker. Come on, come on, open the door. (grunting) (screaming) - Maybe we can make it until the sheriff comes. - But who knows how long that's gonna be. We can't stay here, its not safe. We have to get out of here. - He just kept stabbing him and stabbing him and stabbing him and fucking stabbing him like he was a fucking piece of meat. - Yeah but what are we gonna do? We need a car. - A car. A car. There was a car down the road. Travis and I saw it but there was no keys at all. - That car can be our only chance out of here. - Yeah but she said there's no keys. - It's not a problem remember, my dad used to own a repair shop. - Yeah but you can't do that, it's too dangerous, Kat. - Well this is our only shot out of here. We have to get out of here. We can't stay here. I gotta go. That car could be only shot out of here. I'm willing to take this chance. I'm going. (panting) - Now all we got to do is wait for Kat to come back, okay? - What if she doesn't come back, what if she doesn't even make it to the car? - Calm down. - No. - I'm sure she's gonna be alright. - Oh God. - This is Kat we're talking about. - Oh shit. It's the pizza man's car. Goddamn it! (panting) Shit! Oh God. (tense dramatic music) (screams) - Let me check if I can get some bars. Nothing. - She's probably dead. Just like that, probably found Jimmy and Travis. So that means we're gonna be next. - No we're gonna be fine. Where's the damn sheriff? You know what, no. Fuck the sheriff. Where the fuck is Kat? - Like I said, she's probably dead. (mumbles) - She should of been back by now. Come on. - Oh my God, that must be Kat or the sheriff or the killer but honestly, who the fuck cares anymore. We're all gonna die anyway. (shushes) - Amanda, wait. Wait. - What? - We don't know what's out there. (grunts) - Oh my God. (crickets chirping) I got his keys, so. We're gonna make a run for it to the house and lock ourselves in.
