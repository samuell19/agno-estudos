Ah, how are ya Tina? I know, I seen it. Can't make it down. Alright. I'll be back for me lunch! Story Gemma. How are ya Mrs Quinn? Hiya Stacey love. Did you see outside? I certainly smelt it. Let me guess, the bleedin' Buzzers. They robbed a sewage truck thinking it was full of petrol. A brain is what they'd want to rob. Bastards! What happened to your face? I got into a row up in Audrey Bourke's doing a nixer. You can't be getting into fights Stacey. Who can't? And if Michelle catches you doing nixers there'll be murder. I have to save don't I? It's not cheap moving to Spain. Spain? Why'd you want to go there? Full of English. And me Ma, remember? How could I forget? Her swanning off and you only a child. Yeah, but she had to get out of this kip didn't she? Piglinstown. A town full of fuckin' pigs, isn't that right Mrs Quinn? A few bad apples spoiling everything as usual. Same thing happened back in my day. A big fuck called Noley Poley came in, trying to take over. Me Da said me Granddad drove him out with his concerned citizens group. Hero my Granddad was. We all did our bit. Would you not go out and throw them a few digs now Mrs Q? Yeah, keep on laughing and complaining, but God forbid one of yas would do anything about it. Let me guess, you forgot your key? Ah Michelle, where would I be without ya? Locked out of your butchers shop ya gobshite. Morning girls. - How are ya Jonner? - Hey Jonner. Lovely bit of steak in if yous are after some for dinner? Oh Gemma was only saying she'd love to try a bit of your sausage. Here. I'll drop it back in later. Bye love. Sausage. What happened to your face? What? Your face is scratched off you. I walked into a tree. What tree? What? There's about three trees in Piglinstown. You'd be doing well to walk into one. There's one off the back green. - Is there? - Yeah. A fucking... deciduous it is. You're late Chantelle. Erm... You see, there... there was a fire and then... and then there was a dog okay? And then you see the dog got into the fire and then he started screaming and... Cha... We all know you can't lie. What's going on? It's her nerves. She contours too much when she's nervous. Look at... I had to walk the long way cos Deano said, that if I walked through the car park one more time, that he was gonna shave my head. Oh for God's sake Chantelle! I heard that he'd done it to Laura Martin and her head's like a bleedin' Malteser. You're always hearing things. Don't make it my problem. You hit the fat one! Deano's everybody's fuckin' problem. Pull your hair back. What are you having done love? I love Shirley Bassey. Everybody knows that they drowned poor Dezzie Kane in a shopping trolley. And the Garda, they're doing nothing about it. Me Ma can't even come down and do her shopping. She's terrified. How are you Gemma? When are the council gonna clean up that shite outside? No witnesses. Everyone's terrified. Your man Deano... I would do fuckin' time for him. The science of the mind Mrs Quinn. You need to let all that emotion out. Release it. It's emphysema I have not a bleedin' poltergeist! Alright, see ya in a minute. No, I'm on me way out anyway, so I won't have to put up with it much longer! Don't be sayin' that! Any appointments have yas? Booked up, pal. Is that right, pal? We had an appointment booked didn't we Squeak? How did I miss that? As Stacey said, we're booked up. Maybe whoever done your last cut could do it? Lawnmower was it? So you know, security's gone up. What? Well, you want your shop kept safe. You're already crippling us. You can whistle for your money. Mm. We'll see. Yeah. Whoops. Well they're getting worse they're driving all the shops out an all. Well, Fat Mick is starting a petition to take to the council about it. 100 signatures he has. Surprised that many people round here can write. Stacey, serious, he's saying they could shut all the shops down. Relax you ya bleedin' hysteric. Chantelle, it's scalding! Oh sorry Michelle, it's that tap! That poxy tap! Nearly took Mrs Quinn's scalp off earlier. She made me give her a free treatment for it. First rule of Piglinstown Gem, don't piss off the old ones. Now go on, get that entry for Ahh Hair. I want to show Michelle. Ah not tonight love, I've stock checks to do. Can leave it with Chantelle. Ah come on Michelle. Ah why Michelle. We've been working on it for months. I haven't time Stacey, sorry. Ah Michelle, it'd only take two minutes. I told yas, I want nothing got to do with it! It's just that I was never really into them competitions. All that posing and all. And they're not meant for little shops like us. How yous even got in is beyond me. For being fuckin' brilliant! - And Stacey harassed them. - Oh shut up Chantelle! So I made a few phone calls. Pointed out their consistent lack of diversity. Hm. Go on then. Okay. And then that would go like that. See the back of it. It's supposed to reflect our unique role as a salon. Ours is keep the buzz going. We present this if we make it into the grand final. I know how it works. Chan used real bees wax to do the colours, tell her. Oh here we go. The dull blonde of honey can be recreated by using a point two three violet and a split ash vol. Oxidise with ammonia before application, which I find gives the best smoky undertones. And all that. The nutty professor over there. Don't knock it. The Ahh Hair final is half your piece, half the waffle. You have to sell it. It's good. Very good. We're gonna smash it! Aah, that's great! Ah come on Shell, come with us! Aah, it'll really help our chances if we have you there to make closing comments. Imagine ya Shell. Up on that stage. All the lights and all the three of us... Enough Stacey! Just keep my name out of it, right? You're on your own. Ride ya I says, go in shite I says. I know what you south side fuckers are like with your STDs. Say he has a Mickey like a Lion Bar? "What did you come back to me gaff for then?" he says. "Cos I wanted to see it." I says. Massive it was. And so was his Mickey. Dirty bastards them posh boys are. I swear to God. I'm mean I hadn't even got the clothes off me back and he already had his finger up me back passage. I said get out there you! Before I stick me fist up yours. So I s... What the fuck yas looking at? Well, well, well, if it isn't me darlin' daughter, huh? And the mouth of the south. Far from the south I'm from! Linsey's been there lately though haven't ya Lins? Are ya doing a duet with your oul Dad later? Go way and stop cramping me style, you. Hello girls! How yas doing? Fuck off! Oh fuck off she says. Er how are ya Bingo? Not in the mood tonight. What's the story Patsy? Cider. For all the boys. No problem lads. Let's just have a nice quiet one tonight, yeah? Nice quiet one. What does that remind me of? Oh yeah, bangin' your old one. Here, d'you not like his joke Patsy? Yeah. Just my mother passed away there. Yeah, I know. D'you know Deano robs half his takings every morning. Protection he calls it. Wish his Da had of used protection. Ahh hair. Shame on you! Disgraceful! Put her in jail! Take her scissors! Get off that stage! Oh no girls sketch. Alright girls, what's the story? You alright? Jeez, you're very fuckin' quiet ain't yas? Don't worry, I'm only having a look. Do you know why they call me Two Teeth? Cos I rode two of me teachers at primary school. That's Two Teach, you thick. No, I'm talking about what I knocked out their heads when I was at it. Come on and have a fuckin' dance will ya? - Come on... - Get your fuckin' hands off! Ooh she's very feisty ain't she? Going with the seconds, no? Oh third time's a charm, what? Come on, I know you like dancing. - I've seen ya. - Fuck off! Here! - Leave the girls alone! - Get your fuckin' hands off me!

I'll fuck... Shut your fuckin' mouth! Who else wants a go? He has me hair! You wanna slap me? Leave it out lads will ya? Ha ha boys... It's a disgrace! And they burnt out two cars on the green. And wait until you hear what else they done last night. Robbed Dazzler's karaoke machine. Me songs. No, no! There's just, there's just no even point anymore! They'll shave me head and I can't pull that off Michelle. - Me face is too... - Pick that up now! Pick it up! I poured my life into building this. I will not be bullied out of it by any scumbag! Do you hear me? Oh sorry hun, we're shut. Come back to us again and we'll sort that out for ya. I've seen worse. Terrible thing that's often happening to yous here girls isn't it? Terrible thing. Yous look tired. Sorry, can we help ya there or are you just in for a nose Mr... Flynn. Darren Flynn. From the posters. I'm your local councillor girls. A politician. Do you know what that is? Well I know what me Nanny says yous are. Ah right, very good. Well, I've been keeping an eye on the situation here. Ah, getting out of control isn't it? But you girls would be happy to know that I am taking action. Oh, fantastic! It's about time. We're knocking down the shops. - The fuck? - Excuse me? It's the only way ladies. I mean with the gang escalating the way they are and all them units closing. Well, the place is turning into a health hazard. Hang on a bleedin' second there. You're saying that this is your solution to the gang? It's very emotional isn't it? Very emotional, but think of it as a new start for the area. This whole desperate thing demolished. - Gone. - And then what? Piglinstown 2.0. Lovely apartments. Big coffee chains. A hotel. A hotel? Who the fuck'd stay in Piglinstown? Don't underestimate this area, pet. Full of potential it is. For who? How long have we got? Four weeks notice. - Four weeks? - What? We have a competition in six weeks! A competition? For... for hairdressers? Yeah. Sure I've heard it all now! This is my job. I, I work here. What am I meant to do? Plenty of jobs sweetheart. - Hasn't everyone got hair? - Wait, sorry. - You have to just wait... - Hang on a minute. What if I wanna contest this? What if I want to do something about it? Any more questions, be sure to contact the council offices. There are plenty of machines there to listen to your concerns. Smile girls! It's a wonderful thing. ...and her head's like a bleedin' Malteser! Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah. The hairdressers. - Yeah. - Hmm. A reports already gone in for that. Filed and everything. Your local council rep took care of it. Keeps a close eye on crime around there. Great man. He's the one shutting us down. To stop the gang. Is that not your job? Mr Flynn's solution sounds like a good one to me. Tricky to catch those fellas in their... cars. And what are you in? A poxy rowing boat? Come in Berty. Just spotted your ex in town there. You said to keep an eye. Amanda... Go ahead Unit 4, what's she wearing. Looks like something in leopard print. Stuffed into it so she is. Come on Michelle, so they close us. We do the competition two weeks later. All that publicity and all, we could get a petition going. Get back onto Fat Mick. You never know what could happen around here. Stacey, you can't be a contestant with Ahh Hair unless you're a working salon. You're gonna have to withdraw. What? No, I'm not withdrawing, I'll ring them. I'll get back onto them. I'll tell them what's after happenin... Sta... No, look girls, we'll be able to fix this. It's bollocksed Stacey. They burnt it and everything. This fuckin' kip! What am I meant to do now? Wanna do hair? Where's Chantelle? She's gone out to get drinks. By herself? Alright tramps? What the hell do you think you're doing? - Let her go! - Where you going, huh? Queen of bleedin' Sheeba, swanning around like you're from somewhere you're not. You're gonna be out on your arse soon though aren't ya? Yeah, Deano heard about that. Now, I owe this little fuckin' squeak box here a haircut. But before I do that, me and the boys came in here earlier. You probably noticed that. Found oads of shampoos and all, but the money, yous bitches have that well hid. There is no money. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Don't be lying to Deano. Fuckin' loads of money yas have. And if these shops are going, I'll be taking all I can while I can. Now get it! Wait, wait, wait, wait now... Let's talk about this. You don't need to do this, right? Maybe... ...you're frustrated are ya? Angry and all. Maybe er... maybe you didn't have the best start in life, eh? Do you wanna talk about that? Be nice to just... to just talk. Yeah. Come here to me. You're alright, you're a good person. Come here. You're alright. How's your Da's nose? It isn't broke! Well, I'll do it better the next time! Now! Listen to me! I might be a little bit off me box right now, so I wouldn't go messing with my head any more if I was yous. If yous aren't gonna pay the Deano piper, well, I'm just gonna have to better start me haircuts. Here! Have your money over here you big dozy looking prick! Ah, there she is. I was wondering when you were going to open your smart mouth. You make it too easy for me pal. Coming in here with your little pigeon head on ya! Acting the hard man in your confirmation tracksuit! Stacey, will ya be careful! Your Nanny lives upstairs doesn't she? Maybe I'll pay her a visit sometime. Oh go on, say another word, I dare ya! See I love an old gee Woah! You bitches are bananas! Don't fucking dare, don't fucking... Not me hair, not me hair! I'm gonna shut your fuckin' mouth yas. Is that water alright for ya? What do you make of me tracksuit now, huh? You're fu... Jeez. What do we do? We call, we call the Garda because it was self-defence. It was! Are you mad? Four on one and us just after being down there like a shower of mad yolks? At the very least we'll be arrested. And at the worst, jail. Jail? I couldn't, I couldn't not go to jail like... You would be absolutely fucked in prison Chantelle! I'd get by on me humour. What about me? Ah, you'd be like the pal. The one all the hard bitches use to talk about their feelings. Nobody's fuckin' going to jail! Has anybody got appointments in the morning? I do. I've a highlights first thing. - You'll have to cancel it. - Cancel it? I'm not cancelling a highlights, that's 80 Euro! Better move fast then. You sure them CCTVs couldn't have seen us? Those cameras haven't worked for months. Someone could have looked out a window or something. It's very dark out. They mightn't of known who we were like. Yeah, Chantelle. They'd no way of connecting us to a hairdressers. Look, nobody saw us. Wil yas focus? Right, we need to get that incinerator fired up. I've given out about the smell of burning meat enough times, it can do me a favour for once. You mean were going to... What did you think we were coming in here for? Lamb chops? This way it'll get rid of all the evidence. It'll be just like he ran off. Right... Get phones, keys, anything that won't burn. Right, don't worry, I've seen CSI. He won't fit. Not like that he won't. We're gonna have to cut. Oh my God! Wait, what? I mean, it's just like, like fold him in half or... He's not a slice of fuckin' toast Chantelle. Get them big knives. Okay. Think about this like er Mr Larkin's scabby head or Stella's perm when she hasn't washed for six weeks, okay? We grit our teeth and we focus on the job. Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait. Sh... should we not say something? To who? Blessing or whatever. I think his days of being blessed are over. Will you just give us a minute? Things were done. Things were said, er... You were a prick and now you're dead, amen. Let's fuckin' do this. Okay. Aim for the middle. It's me irritable bowel. Me nerves are gone! Stop laughing at me girls! Stop. Me stomach is in knots This is for me Da! Murder! There was. When we left that off the menu the last time. Now the chicken is served on a skewer. So we stab it through before it goes into the oven. But if you don't want that, we have a chop! Oh a lovely tender piece of meat from Jonner's over the way. Now it can come out a little bit charred, but... I think we'll have just four vodkas thanks Patsy. A liquid lunch is it? Spoil yourselves girls! What has him in such good form? We have. Deano wasn't around to rob half his takings last night. How's everyone doing? Well, Chantelle is in the pub, so, something must have shifted in the universe. Just... I don't feel as scared coming down here now that I know he's gone. There's a theory about it. There's a surprise. Serious. About how what we done is... ...well, about right and wrong. Imagine these are all the good things about Deano. The good he does in the world. Nice things you know. So throw them all out. Let's give him the benefit of the doubt, right? Then we look at all the bad things. Hurting people, people he'd hurt. All that. It's like in the scheme of things... We've done the world a favour. Would you look at Patsy! And does it still have Donna Summer? Fuck off Maisie, it's not till Saturday. I tell ya what Patsy, that scumbag has found Jesus or something. I wake up this morning there's me gear out in the garden. Like it was from fuckin' Santi! Good Jaysus! Did someone have a word? What? Someone did something. Now there's a man's hand I'd like to shake, huh? They were in the boot of his car. We say nothing. Back to normal. The world is the same as it was yesterday. Just one less prick in it. What the hell are you doing? Jesus Christ, Stacey! I told you to get rid of that! There's 50 Euro credit on it! Relax, it's a burner yolk. You can't trace it. You should text all the gang from it, pretending to be Deano and tell them all to fuck off too. They couldn't be that stupid. Right... It's a miracle! Something like that. A stay on the closure, right? I went down to the council right? Go on Micka! I said, "The gang's gone right? So don't start with ya public safety talk and your shutting down shops to build bleedin' apartments without consulting the people, right? - Right! - Respect! You tell them Mick! Because we need real investment, right? - Right! - Right! - Job opportunities, right? - Yeah. - Creches, right? - Right! Right! Buses. Right? That Deano fella saw you were on a mission. He ran like Jaysus. Probably gone to Alicante. Yeah, well he's definitely gone somewhere, hot? But remember, it's on hold. Not cancelled. And there's people in there want this plan pushed through. Isn't that right, Councillor Flynn? I only want what's best for the area. So now that we have the council's attention, we need to keep it, right? Girls, your hairstyle show. Council isn't gonna wanna shut down shops with an award winning salon in it, right? I mean, I don't mean to put pressure on ya, but... Mika, our entry is destroyed. Deano wrecked it when he broke in. Bastard! Yeah, he was... is, whatever. Either way pal. I'm sorry, but... ...we're out of Ahh Hair. Couldn't you make your beehive again? No, that takes two months to set. I'm sorry, pet. We can still do it. It won't be easy, but we still have time to come up with something else. We have to try it. We? Yeah. We. That's our plan. We stick together as a community, right? Yeah. We batter that plan, right? - Yes! - Yes! We snack box it in the bleedin' mouth, right? - Yeah! - Yes! Suntan lotion. No. So if we had like two more we'd make a crown out of it. Kind of every day in a salon is a party type thing. You know. Rubbish! The breast salon in town. No! No! Stop putting wigs on things! So we kind of like work hard as a salon, so we have like the drill and then like tools. Maybe a hammer or some nails or something and then when you turn the drill on, it kind of goes curly. Look, I'll show ya. I'll plug it in, hold on. It's a nest. It still looks like a gee to me. Not the way I wax hun. So we go in there saying our unique role as a salon is a fuckin' nest? No! Look, I'll er leave you's to it. Have to go home and sit on a bag of peas. I was with that posh fella again last night and me back box is brutalised. Lovely. I'm like a piebald in Finglas, I am! - Ridden ragged! - Right! We get the picture Linsey. Go on! - See ya. - See ya. Jesus, we haven't a sniff of an idea yet and a model. We can use ourselves for the rounds, but if we get into the grand final we need something wow! And Linsey won't cut it. And there's a good chance she'll try riding one of the judges. It's not a joke Stacey! Sorry. It's these competitions. This competition has me wound up. You're one of the best hairdressers I've ever seen Michelle. What is it about Ahh Hair has you so freaked? You've done it before. Yeah. I certainly did. Hun, did something happen back then? I suppose yous... ...yous need to know. Because it all started with him. D'Logan Doyle. D'Loganaah... He was the best of the best. And me? I was as cocky as anything. The neck of me after training in a little shop in Piglinstown applying for a job with D'Logan Doyle. But then I got it. I was in. In the Highlighted Circle. The what? The five top salon chains in the country. The hair untouchables. D'Logan paid a lot of attention to me, cos I was good. Really good. But other people wanted his attention too. And they weren't too happy that the likes of me was getting it. I'd come in from outside the circle, you see. Very rare. Everybody knew D'Logan was looking for a protégé. A what? Someone to become his next big thing. So when the two of us qualified for Ahh Hair finals, we knew it was down to us. Me and Pippa Chadwick. I wasn't worried. D'Logan had set me up with an amazing model. A star at the time. I was gonna turn her head into the owl off The Late Late... I had me speech in already for when I finished. Brilliant at that bit I was. I'd sell anything. But I never got to make it. When I started the colour work, something went wrong. Very wrong. Something was in the formula. Someone had put something in it. And all the girls hair started falling out. I balded her. Right there on stage of Ahh Hair. In front of the whole world of hairdressing. And before the last hair hit the stage, I was finished. Shame on you! Didn't matter what I said. D'Logan turned his back. No salon would dare touch me. Pippa won. Got D'Logan's endorsement and went on to build a Dalton Chadwick empire. While I... Had to come back to this kip. Peggy who own the salon I trained in had died in a fight. I took the shop, kept me head down and built me own little empire. Come here and sit down. No wonder you wanted nothing to do with the competition. Yeah, a lot of old faces there. A lot of bad memories. Well, we're about to make new ones. Ones that involve you taking that geebag Pippa's arse and handing it to her, right? Ah, she's not the only problem. The highlighted circle. They're the salons that win Ahh Hair. Just rotates every year. I've never seen an outsider beat them. No-one's ever beat Deano before either. Dos patatas por favor. Dos patatas por favor. What does that mean? Two singles. Starting with the essentials Gem. Operation Stace to Spain is back in action. How's your Ma? Has she said about going over? Not yet, but she will when she sees Ahh Hair and all. Just... shouldn't have to win a competition to like... I mean like she's your Ma... She's running a top salon over there Gemma. She can't have bleedin' nobody hairdressers working in it. I just need to build up a profile. Then she'll have me over. She just needs to know I'm good enough. That's all. Right? Right. Course. Well I think you're great hun. And I'm gonna miss ya. Go on you, ya sap. Work to do. Oh don't be stupid go and enjoy your date. Aah, thanks! Are you sure? Yeah, you can fill us in tomorrow. Yeah, it'll be me getting filled in tonight, wait until I tell ya about this Southside fella Michelle. Oh! Go on, luck. Go on! Ya scumbag rat, ya! Yeah, ya scumbag rat! Alright, alright. Prick. Garda Collins of Darlestown. Yeah. We met. Oh right, yeah. I'm just following up on your break in. Bit late for that. Councillor Flynn has a bit of a thing about where this Deano fellas gone to, so... Oh he's concerned about him not tormenting the area now is he? Touché. Er well, if I could just ask a few questions? Actually, you know what? We are really busy at the moment. So I... Oh well, I'll just talk to her. - What? - Oh God! Actually, you know what? If you give me a minute, I can just... No, no, no, no. Any of ya'll do. Erm, I'm actually not really good at er... talking. Ah, It'll be easy. All you need to do is not tell me any lies. So did ya know this Deano fella? Yeah. And when would you say you saw him last? I didn't. You didn't see him? Erm... I mean, I dunno. Would you have seen him around the shops in the last week or the past few days? Erm, Yester... year. Did you ever see him get in a row with anyone? I do colours! Do you know he drowned Dezzie Kane in a shopping trolley? Everyone knows that. - Did he tell you that? - No. So you don't know. - I mean, yeah. - Yeah. - No! - Well which is it? What? - Any idea where he's gone. - No. - He's probably like er... - Probably what? He's probably er, a dog... - Dog? What dog? - I don't know. Like a German shepherd or something like him and... - Are you hiding something? - No, I mean... Then spit it out! - What are you trying to tell me? - I don't know, I just... Do you know what happened to this Deano fella or not? Yes, I do, because we killed him! We killed him with the hot tap and the hairspray and Stacey's good cutting scissors! I deserved that. I'm sorry for going so hard on ya. Sure look, we all know what happened here, huh? One scumbag goes after another. Blah, blah, blah. Of course, you know what we say? No body, no bother. Oh, you'd better believe it. Yeah. Well, good luck. Good luck now! And see, listen, come in for a haircut for free. On me. So it was worth getting out of bed so. Bye! Good luck. The hair tongs are heating up. Just two weeks now until the hair elite meet at the event they literally exist for. Aahh Hair. We hope they're ready. Just think unique role. Creative mind doesn't respond to pressure Michelle. We can't force it. We have to wait for the idea to come to us. Yeah, well it would want to hurry up. Too much at stake here. Yeah, because bone actually never fully burns. So if the council actually do decide on knocking down the shops, then there's a good chance that they might find a skull or something in that incinerator. And then we're caught rapid. Well, I hadn't thought of that Chantelle. But thanks very much. Is that the door? What? Is the door locked? I don't know. Careful girls. Oh... Hey yas. No! You're not shaving my head! I used to be bad. Very bad. But I got locked up. Did a course. Massage and that. Was gonna turn me life around. Namaste and all, but when I got out started offering people massages. I got laughed out of it. Before I knew it I ended up back in Deano's crew. Tormenting old ladies and turning their shops into a drug den? I never wanted to do any of that. But Deano... trapped I was. Then all of a sudden, we gets a text saying that this place was red hot. And Deano was gone. And I thank God for that. You're welcome. So I wanna put things right. I got yas a crystal salt lamp. Good energies for yas in the competition. Appreciate that. Yeah. We'd have taken the cash either. Well if er, if you don't mind, Bingo is it? We have a lot of work to do. Well, I hope yous do well.

Tara Tobin here, reporting live on Fad TV at Ireland's most exclusive hair event, Ahh Hair. Stay tuned as six salons will compete for a place in the final of Salon Stars, judged by hair extraordinaire D'Logan Doyle. Fuck you, Jeremy. I saw you angle the camera up to catch me slow eye. I fuckin' saw ya. And go easy on the goose Mary, okay? - Hiya. - Hi! Salon Stars finalists. We need our stations please? Oh, Dalton Chadwick? House of Hair. Colour Camp Club? Deadly Cuts. From? Piglinstown. Oh! Don't shoot! There you go. Thank you, brilliant. Fab, there you go. Okay, you go get set up and I'll suss out the stage. And come here, don't be making a show of me! How would we make a show of ya? Get your poxy fuckin' gear out of our station now before I shove those curling tongs up your hole! Fucks sake! Oh, my God. You have got to be the Sweaty Bettys. No, what is it again? Curl Up and Die? No, no. - A Cut Above... - We're Deadly Cuts. 'Deadly'. That is just perfect! And who the fuck are you? We're Dalton Chadwick. An elite network of hair technicians founded by Pippa Chadwick. With a combined Instagram following of 1.8 million, including almost two Kardashians. Operating all over Dublin and in a dozen destination salons around the globe. We're beside a butchers. I guess the contest are trying to do some outreach stuff or something. You know, you must be nervous hun. Coming over here trying to put us down. You're a pun salon, hun. You've about as much chance of winning as a dark brunette going single step to platinum without all her hair falling out. Well, actually there's new bonding compositions that let you by pass the dark melanine obstructor. So you can achieve platinum in one application without damaging the shaft at all. Tricky, but it is possible. Welcome to the Ahh Hair Final. Eimear, I told you to go and get my special medical bag. My face is softening for Christ sakes! Right, alls good girls. We just need to... Well, well. A hair criminal at a hair competition. I should call the Gards. Isn't age cruel girls. Pippa, how... how have you been? Well, I haven't balded anyone, if that's the benchmark. Classic. Let's go girls. That was a good one. Stop speaking. Hair doesn't get more dramatic than this folks. Contestants have arrived and the room is abuzz as we all await the arrival of hair legend D'Logan Doyle. I caught up with Ahh Hair judges Shelly Sherlock and Buggy O'Sullivan to find out why D'Logan gets everyone so delighted. I hope that everybody here knows what a privilege it is to even share the same airspace as that man. Mhm. Innovation. I mean, innovation is, is D'Logan's middle name. Er... He invented innovation. He invented it. He invented innovation. He, he innovated innovation. Hair matters. Oh she'd sour your milk! And how we will focus people's attention is with a god like creature like D'Logan. And we can't wait to see D'Logan Doyle take to the stage. Yous are about to witness genius. Here he comes. Oh my God! That's him? It looks like the fella me Nanny used to feed outside the church. Show some respect. Girls,... ...let's do hair! Okay you beautiful blow-dry bastards, wake up your inner Picasso it's Colour Round. The Ahh Hair colour qualifier is under way. Here stylists must show our judges they know how to hit the bottle. And I'm not talking about the bubbles we'll all be drinking later. Hmm. This is the first of three rounds where salon teams present their trilogy of hair skills. Before just two are selected to go on to the Avant Garde Grand Final, judged by the D'man himself, D'Logan Doyle. Dryers... down! Oh Jaysus, look at all that they have. Your one's gorgeous. What are you trying to say? Listen to me. It's all in how you sell it. Remember? Throwing money at models is worth nothing unless you can talk them through your thinking. And if there's one thing our salon know how to do, it's bleedin' talk. I'm not, I'm not really good at talking like. Yeah, not like a normal person. But you can talk colour. Stick to the science and all, alright? What lens are you using there? You use that fat lens on me again and I will kick your head in. You can run to HR. Judges, judges are... And the judges have entered the room. Time to see what they think of our salons. I love it. I actually love it. Can, can you ask her to turn around so I can see her from the back please? Oh Jesus, that was the back. You see, you have failed with brown. How can you fail with brown? It's making my ears bleed. It's making my ears bleed! My eyes. Do you know what this is called? We call it product. Maybe you could use some. How many years have you trained? Don't answer, don't answer. It will depress me too much. I'll have to kill myself. I am losing the will to live. Did you waste three hours of your life on this? Of her life. And ten seconds of our time. Ratty, ratty ends. And now... Darling, don't get too close. You might never get back out. Hello? I can't talk right now, right? You know, I'm Maid Marion. I want to join the Merry Men. I wonder if it's one of those hair dos that makes you work. - You maybe onto something. - Yeah. But it faces you with your very fears. And this is one of my fears. The environment is so on trend right now. I made a green that matches the luscious trees outside out flagship salon. Who's up first? I think it's little Chantelle. Erm the... the greys... the... the greys they erm... Science Chan. Death of melanin in the hair follicles, combined with a build of hydrogen peroxide in the shaft is what causes us to go grey. So I recreated this natural reaction using pigment extractions and subtle black tones. Creating something beautiful from something we usually see as lifeless. You see, sometimes the absence of a colour is a colour in itself. Listen up ladies and gentle cutters. Time to snip those strands. It's cutting rounds. Everyone expecting Dalton Chadwick to perform strongly here as usual. Colour Camp Club sure to keep things interesting. But as ever at Ahh Hair, nobody quite knows what the judges are in the mood for today. And... cut. I mean, don't cut. Stop cutting. So, we went for a classic look with classic lines because sometimes we forget that classic... ...is just classic! Next. So if you look at it right. The line never ends. Round and round it goes. Like the thoughts in our head can. Do you know what I mean hun? Oh God, I do! Another good judging round for this unknown salon from Piglinstown. Always surprises at Ahh Hair. She was great, wasn't she great? Here, you watch yourself. I like your edge. So prison. Hair huns, it's do or die time. Your last chance to impress the judges and earn your place in the Grande Finale. So style my pretties, style. It's our final qualifying round here at Ahh Hair. Up dos, down dos, everywhere a-do-dos, as contestants create their signature hairstyle for the judges. - What? - It's broke! What do you mean it's broke? Michelle. Chan. Can you go try and find me another dryer? Has anybody got the lend of another dryer? Has anybody got another dryer? Brilliant! Oh. Ten minutes to inspection! Fuck it's all my fault! I should have set up early, I'm always poxy late. But it's... ...wet! You'd better believe it pal. Look at, late for work, school run, drug raid in your kitchen. Sometimes you need to get outta the house quick. But just because you're on the run doesn't mean your hair should look like a bag of rats. Right? Uh, my God, she's right! It's... practical! Hmm. I'm Stacey Barry and this is the Piglinstown Pony. It's crunch time here at Ahh Hair. The top salons in the country have battled it out and now the judges take to their hair chambers to decide which two will go on to the Avant Garde Grand Final. Join us after the break here on Fad TV for the live finalist announcement. Jaysus, they could well get through. And who's going to be the model? I'm telling you, I'm a model I am! And I'm Barry bleedin' White. Ladies and gentlemen, the finalist announcement. - Hey yas. - Hey. Sorry I'm late. I done a shamanic prayer for yas in the jax. Hope ya sprayed something. Six top salons. Three gruelling rounds. And now two finalists! Competing for the title of Salon Stars... Dalton Chadwick! Oh! Calm yourself woman, you're embarrassing yourself. And taking them on in their very first Ahh Hair appearance... ...Deadly Cuts! Over my dead fucking hairpiece! Finalists please prepare for the grand final. If you're not a finalist, get out! I'm talking to you Mary. Finally get to do that closing speech Shell. Me nerves Gem. You're alright Chan. There's nothing to worry about. I suppose you're a model and all? Model that ya prick! This sounds like sour grapes to me Phillipa. I like their pep. Oh my God! Shelley, wake up! From whatever cocktail of pills you're on these days. If a salon like that wins a competition like this, it's going to turn our industry on its head. People are going to think, well maybe I don't need to go to some big name salon. Maybe I don't have to spend 200 Euros on a blow dry. We can't have it. The Highlighted Circle must be protected. Like it protected you and it made you rich. Deadly Cuts cannot win. Dalton Chadwick will now take on Deadly Cuts. Please take your places for the grand final. Oh sorry! Oops! How embarrassing. Friendly warning. It's over for you. The Highlighted Circle have arranged it. So you can go up on that stage and get torn apart by the judges. And believe me, you will be. You can relive all that brutal humiliation. Or you can run, now. Back into that hole you come from. You could save us all the indignity. The two finalists in Salon Stars will now go head to head for our star judges. Without any further ado... Let us welcome the team from Dalton Chadwick. All hail... The Queen. Well, I guess we at Dalton Chadwick consider ourselves some er hairdressing royalty. Using our exclusive network of salons and a dash of blackmail we were able to source the design of the Princess of Monaco's crown. Recreated here in shades of silvers and blondes that represent literal money. And yes, I know what you're all wondering. The gold streaks are real gold. What is our unique role as a salon? Hm? Well, it's very simple really. We're here to rule. By maintaining the meticulous standards of our hairdressing world where only the very best reaches the top. And the others, the others stay where they belong. Don't mind them. Okay? D'Logan, your comment please? I liked the nipples. Shelley Sherlock! Unbeatable. Buggy O'Sullivan! Yes, blow drys should be expensive. That fella's a degenerate! And now for the little salon that can. A warm welcome to Deadly Cuts! Oh my God! - Let's go. - Let's go. Come on Michelle, we're on. I can't. You what? I can't put one foot in front of the other. My body will not move. I just can't... Deadly Cuts to the stage! Deadly Cuts! Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure they're just getting themselves in order. Uh, any moment now. We won't win, we won't win. They're all against me. You sound like a madwoman. I can't. - The humiliation... - The humiliation? The fucking humiliation? Something's wrong. Let me tell you what's humiliating. Some prick coming in and shutting down your shop with nothing but a poxy letter. Old ones getting battered in car parks and knowing that nobody's gonna do anything about it. People losing their jobs, they're bleeding chipper. All so someone else can make money. Still waiting for you Deadly Cuts. You've a community relying on ya. And you're worried about them dopes with the 100 Euro eyebrows might what... look at ya funny? We've all been pissed on Michelle, but nobody can humiliate ya unless you let them. It's about time you stopped letting them. Get out on the stage please? Is someone getting arrested? Probably Stacey. ♪ We fight, we fight ♪ ♪ We fight, we fight ♪ She's a no show. ♪ We fight, we fight ♪ It's not always easy running a salon where we do. Sometimes it can feel like working in a war zone. But just cos you're at war, doesn't mean you can't look fab, hun. What in the aul Jaysus is that? It's Piglinstown. I used real glass shard collected at our shops to create the shimmer in the colour. Doubling the reflections, which gives the illusion of movement. Just like the shadows creeping around the corner. You have to get through some debris to see our highlights. But no matter how hot it gets, we keep your look... fire! Ooh hoo! Ring a ding ding girls! Anyone seen me pal, Deano? What the fuck are you doing here? Get off! Think I'm stupid? That, that's him! Where's the phone? In your knickers is it? You get your fuckin' hands off me! Where's Deano's phone? I don't fuckin' know! I knew that text wasn't right. Full stops and all. None of us have the phone! - What you talking about? - Hi there Squeak! Oh Stacey, he got hold of me! Off! How do you have the phone? Maybe somebody should be calling the police? Don't touch me, you'll get a slap. Fuck is this shit? Dublin's got bleedin talent or something? Here, I've got a talent for yas. Wanna see me big flute. Michelle, Michelle! You're gonna shoot me are ya? Oh no, relax, relax! It's only fake! Michelle! Come on! Come on. Quick, quick, quick. Come on girls. Go, go, go, go... Cover the trolley, cover the trolley. Michelle Roche... as I live and weave. You see, sometimes there are no rules. And sometimes there are no rulers. Certainly not where we're from! Because rules make hair trends boring. And rulers make hairdressing boring! Our unique role as a salon at Deadly Cuts well... Let's just say we like to keep it dangerous. Because when things get stale and old. It's time to take them out! D'Logan D'likes! While I only come back here when contractually obliged or to contest paternity suits, it's nice when I do to find artists willing to take real risks. Deadly Cuts... D'Logan D'likes! I've never forgotten you. Even the balding? I thought that was a drug dream. Just kiss me. What the hell happened? Darling, D'Logan D'liked. D'no one says no to D'Logan. Uh uh. Here, you need to have her arrested. The wire on my hairdryer was cut and I found these at her station. And don't bother denying it, cos I got a confession. She slapped me! You're lucky that's all ya got! Sabotage! Phillipa, you are a disgrace to the Highlighted Circle. Get outta me way you dope! Thank you Jamie. Ah thank you Lataylor. It is good to be back. You have to go now and deal with the car. I'll stick around here and do the press and that. And here, get that fuckin' gun off Chantelle before she takes someone out. See you back at the Pigger yeah? Michelle! Maybe. So Michelle before we talk about your lips, we should discuss your plans for the move. Move? Well, you can hardly stay in Pigtown now can you? It's Piglinstown. And the mouthy one. You need to lose her. Stacey? Our clients like their stylists submissive. And speaking of submissive, did you see how limp Lataylor's barrel wave came out. Pathetic! Pass the remote. Someone needs to turn up the volume. There's a party in my blimp. Let's go. You might get to see Pippa being thrown out. But your man Two Teeth, he was in on the whole thing. All faked it was, totally faked. Whatever you say, right? So, where's the trophy girls? So we can stick it up Councillor Flynn's arse! Here it is! ♪ No never no more, will I play the wild rover ♪ ♪ No never, no more ♪ Want any chops. I mean, lovely bit of lamb in... I have like no... Up all night he had me. I mean, Stacey, Free Willy wouldn't have been able to take the harpooning I got. I don't want to know Linsey! I'm just saying, the size of it! It was about the length of... It's me Ma! Heya Ma! Look at, say hey to Linsey! Do you remember Linds? Oh Jaysus, is that the Pigger? Oh I can smell that place from here. Yeah, I know, Kip isn't it? That old perv Patsy still behind the bar I see. He's not a perv. Yeah, well he looks like one. Anyway, listen. I wanted to talk to you. Yeah, I know. Sorry, I was looking at flights and all and... Yeah, no, about that. Look, I've kind of got me own thing going on over here with the salon, me clients. I can't have some 20 year old coming over saying she's me kid. I'm 22. Are ya? That's even worse. Do you know how old that makes me look Stacey? I'm 33 over here. They don't believe that do they? Well listen, it's just not the right time love, okay? Maybe in a couple of year. Listen, with Visas and all, just leave it. Anyway, I've got to go. I've got some fella coming to do me lips at 10. I'll see ya, right. Stace come here for a minute. Fuck off Chantelle will ya? I'll be back in a minute. That was a bit harsh wasn't it? She's always annoying me. Spain not happening? You know, sometimes when people treat you badly, it says a lot about them. She's me Ma. I know. I thought... I just thought, when we won the competition. Visas she's saying, fuckin' visas! It's the EU, does she think we're fuckin' thick? Well if she does then she really doesn't know you. See, do you know what I think? I think one day your Ma's gonna wake up and realise what a brilliant, funny, mad little young one she made. And ran away from her the first chance she got. Yeah, well, her loss was our gain. And our pain in the hole every now and again. But... You can't spend your life trying to please people who screw you over Stacey. It makes it hard to notice you're surrounded by people who never would. ♪ We walk the walk, we fight the fight ♪ ♪ Piglinstown will be alright ♪ That was actually great girls! Yeah, it was. Well done! I don't know why you didn't ask me to model girls? I've done a bit of it back in me day, you know? Yeah, for the Farmer's Journal. The neck of this thing. Have we not voted you out yet? Yeah. Working late are we ladies? Ah, I love to see the work ethic around here. Oh it's a fine thing. I think you must be lost there councillor. Yeah.

Look, there yous are. Yeah. Isn't that lovely huh? You know what they say don't ya? Today's headlines, tomorrows chip wrappings. Yous are out in six weeks. What are you talking about? Don't mind him, Mick talked to the council. Oh yes of course, the fella from, the chipper went in with his little petition and reconsidering, reviewing, oh there'll be a committee. That all adds up to the same thing girls. We're just waiting for people's attention to move on. So, like I said, six weeks' notice. But we won our competition. You can't knock an award winning salon. You honestly believed that did you? You thought that you'd whip up some community spirit and everything will be okay? You thought a hairdressers would beat money? Yeah go on, keep laughing. I'll show you what a hairdressers can be. Oh good Jaysus, the problems I've had ladies. I mean first me gang disappears. And then yous started up. Yous did delay me. I'll give you that. All very frustrating it was now, very frustrating. I had investors getting nervous with your shite. I even lost one of them. Because you made me look like I wasn't in control of the local situation. Well, I am back in control now girls. You can't do this. I live upstairs. - That's me home! - Yeah. - Ah, don't you worry. - You tell him. We'll make sure you move somewhere nice and handy for ya. Like Navan. Did he say fuckin' Navan? Er well girls, I must be off. Once I'm done with this dump, plenty more areas to improve. To destroy you mean. So you can line your own pockets. Very good Twink. The brains round here, huh? Get outta me way! What about us, the community that lives here? When are you going to get it you tragic old tramp. He can't get away with that. What? Nobody gives a fuck. Jaysus Tessie, I never thought you'd have to do that again. Ah what are they going to do, give me life? Mrs Quinn!

First rule of Piglinstown don't piss off the old ones. What are we gonna do with this fella? Back then there was all parkland for digging. Isn't a Jaysus tree around the place these days. So how the hell do you get rid of a body in Piglinstown? Well, it's more like an award winning salon. Well, did you talk to your Ma? Not the right time I told her. Gone off Spain.
