[YELLING] [CLAMORING] [TURNS OFF MUSIC] Leave the man alone. Hey, pal, get out of here. This ain'’t none of your business. When punks start hassling decent people, I make it my business. Now give the man his money back. No, that'’s not gonna happen. Now get out of my way. Put the knife away, son. I said get out of my way. Now you gonna move, or am I gonna finish off that goofy-lookin'’ haircut of yours? [GRUNTS] [GROWLS] Now give the man back his wallet. Now. Give it to him. Thank you, mister. Don'’t mention it. Glad I can help. You boys ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Save the violins. Come on, guys, let'’s blow. Man, that wasn'’t worth it. Hey, pal, what do you say you give me back my knife? Let'’s talk about it. Come on, it'’s special to me. Ain'’t nothing special about those things. Any fool could find trouble with them. Come on, I need it. My father gave it to me. Do it mean enough to you to show up at this place tomorrow afternoon at four o'’clock? Francis Wilard Junior High? I'’m dead meat on this turf. If anybody hassles you, you show them that card. Four o'’clock. I can be their earlier. No skipping school. Not if you wanna see your knife again. Four o'’clock.Maybe. What'’s your name? They call me The Dude. Come on, you can do better than that. Billy Greene. Okay, Billy Greene. I'’ll see you tomorrow. Four o'’clock. Hey, what'’s your name? They call me Bruise. [DISCO MUSIC PLAYING] Hi, Bruise. How did the kids do in the game? We won.Oh, good, good. Now you get to work before I report you to the management. Okay, I'’m going, I'm going. Oh, too late. The management has arrived already. Good evening, Mr. Richard, sir.Hi, Mom. Are you gonna supervise your restaurant, or are you just passing through? I'’m supervising, Mom, I'’m supervising. Bruise, go look like a bouncer. Hey, uh, how'’d you do in the game?We won. Hey, great! So the kids are in the finals, huh? Next week. Man, some day I'’m going to learn not to bet against you. What do you think you'’re doing? Don'’t start again, okay? Get decent and get home. And do what? Wait while you'’re out beer-drinking with your bowling buddies? Hey, you guys, keep it down. He'’s just jealous 'cause I'’m a big attraction. Man, I hate her working here. Yeah, I know. Hey, what a night. Guess who'’s here? Donna Summer? Oh, no. Much better. Tanker Weams. Tanker Weams look better to you than Donna Summer? Come on, we are talking about the three-time defending champion of the Toughest Man in the World competition. So? What'’s he doing here? He'’s in town to promote this year'’s contest. Uh, feel free to go to work, huh? [DISCO MUSIC PLAYING] Steve, give me the usual. Straight up, or on the rocks? Don'’t be cute. Hitting the bar a lil'’ kind of hard, aren'’t you? I hate it. My ulcer loves it. Ulcers? Man, what you got to worry about? My ulcer. Also the price of doing business. This place has got something though, you know? [BOTH LAUGH] MAN: Come on! I can'’t even see the girls, man. I paid good money for this. Of course I wanna see some dancers. Oh, it'’s too early for this. Look, I hate to tell you this, but the guy with the big mouth has also got muscles to match. That'’s Tanker Weams. I don'’t care who he is, he still don'’t have to act like a fool. Just be careful. TANKER: I didn'’t come here to listen to music, I wanna see some dancing! Let'’s have the girls. Come on! Excuse me, sir, won'’t you mind holding down to World War III, please? Listen, little man, you get that dancer back here, or you'’re gonna wish World War III was your only problem. I'’m sorry, he's gonna have to leave. Let'’s get out--Sit down! You think you'’re muscly enough to throw me out? Well, champ, it would be more dignified if you were to walk out on your own. "Dignified"? You know, where I come from, dignified don'’t sell many tickets. Are you ready to get down? Huh? Come on. You ready to get down? Come on. Easy, champ, you had too much to drink. He is right, Tanker. Besides, we don'’t need a lot of bad publicity. There are a lot of people here. Let'’s go. Come on. TANKER: Well, looks like you got on a long list to place. Dicky, what'’s going on? It'’s okay, Ma, it's okay. Bruise and I took care of it. You got a car?Yeah, it'’s over there. Hey, champ, why don'’t you go home with your manager, okay? That'’s a good idea. Come on. Let'’s go. BRUISE: Good, all right.Okay, Bruise? Oh, yeah--Look out! [GRUNTS] Oh, you'’ve made me mad now! Knock it off, knock it off.[GRUNTING] [INDISTINCT YELLING] You need any help? Hi, Ernie. You want me to book this guy?Oh, hey. Wait. Listen, please, don'’t let him book him. It'’ll really pile things up for us. How long you in town? Well, we'’re here for the Toughest Man contest. What, several weeks. I'’ll tell you what. I run a center for kids. They'’ll be really impressed if the toughest man in the world comes by someday. Sober. You got a deal. We'’ll do a weight demonstration. Anything you want. All right, I'’m holding you to that.Okay. Come on! Come on. Thanks, Ernie. Everything is cool. I can tell by looking at your boss. Hey, Dick, you all right? Yeah, yeah, I'’m okay, I'm okay. Just tell my mom I was ahead on the points, huh? Yeah. Points. BRUISE: All right, all right, defense, defense, get this man. Get this man. Hands up. Come on, come on, come on, get in there! Aw, come on, what kind of stuff is that? Aw, come on. Aw, come on, move your arm, man. [BOYS YELLING] All right, set it up, set it up. Set it up, all right. Pass it, pass it. Keep it moving, keep moving! Make a second feint. Beautiful one. Drive, drive! [CHEERING] All right. All right. Now that'’s what I call getting down with our own bad selves. [CHEERING]You guys are beginning to look good. Now you see the difference when you wait for the shot?ALL: Yeah! Outside, we'’re not so strong, but inside, we'’re deadly.[CHEERING] Don'’t forget your appointment. You'’re right. I gotta meet the landlady. Look here, you practice for about 10 minutes and I'’ll be right back. ALL: Okay. Let'’s go. BOY: All right, start the ball. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey, you found us. So, you run this joint? I wouldn'’t put it like that. But they do let us use the facilities. Maybe you wanna stick around, play a little basketball? Nah, I didn'’t come here to bounce no ball. My knife, remember? Oh, yeah. Knife. Figured me for a no-show, didn'’t you? No, I never sell a kid short. I expect the best, '’cause any of them can do it. Great. Now that we'’re done with the chit-chat, where'’s my sticker? Somewhere. Somewhere? No, no, don'’t give me "somewhere." I come all the way to this cesspool and you give me "somewhere"? Where is it? Why? Who do you need to stick? I ain'’t going naked, man. Too many guys who'’d like to chop my butt. Big man in the streets, huh?I carry some weight. They want to see if there'’s a guy I'’d like to use on a basketball court till I get back. Just a few minutes. When do I get my knife?Sometime. "Somewhere, sometime." Yo, fathead, what are you try-- Just a minute. Let me lay down the rules of this establishment. I deal with every kid with an even hand, and nobody ever give me no back-talk. Now go play. All right. All right. For a little while. [PLAYFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Well... look who we'’ve got here. Bet he'’s spying on us for the Colonel'’s game next week. BOY 1: So what is it? Just killing time. BOY 2: Yeah, we got an important game coming up. Maybe you ought to kill time somewhere else. ALL: Yeah. Maybe I like it here. What'’s to like? I like your leader'’s haircut. I'’m thinking of getting me one. ALL: Bruise? How do you know Bruise? He'’s my cousin. Very nice outside shot. Oh, Mr. Brubaker, you'’re late.Yes, ma'’am, but I was-- Please, come right in. Excuse me. This will just take a moment. Won'’t you have a seat? Thank you, ma'’am. Now you have been supervising the youth center since Mr. Denker resigned, correct? Yes, ma'’am. I've been the coach and water boy, too. Are you aware that the youth center was supposed to be closed when Mr Denker left? But Miss Easton, the number of kids have more than tripled since I took over. I don'’t take no salary. Don'’t even want to. Yes, well, I'’m afraid that's beside the point, Mr. Brubaker. You see, the city feels that without a certified and trained supervisor, a program like-- You don'’t need no certificate to tell when a kid'’s in trouble. Well, that may be, but this is a school facility. Can'’t no kid stay in my center unless he'’s doing well in school. Mr. Brubaker, I feel that your efforts and your policies are commendable. But I'’m afraid the city has a very closed mind about these things. Ain'’t nobody closing down my center for my kids. They already did. What do you mean? I mean that the funding has been cut off. And unless you can come up with a great deal of money very quickly, I'’m afraid you're out of business. I'’m sorry, but you'll have to excuse me. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Bruise, you know, that new guy, he'’s a real wise-ass. He sure can shoot. I mean, we'’re talking downtown playground. All right, I played. Now fork it over. So why don'’t you play for us in the finals? Then we'’ll talk about your knife. What are you trying to pull? I'’m trying to pull you off the streets, lil brother. Maybe you can do us some good, maybe we can do you some good. Great. You want your knife back? Think about it. Bruise, the guy with the team shirts came by. He said if we buy 24, they'’re $9.50 each, plus tax. Well, how much is that?Beats me. $241.68. How'’d you work that out? It'’s easy. It's the same as a $24 bet payed in nine and a half to one. Instead of subtracting six percent minus commission, you add it up. Not only is he Freddie Brown, he'’s Nick the Greek, too. Don'’t matter how you figured, we still don'’t have the money. Why not? Miss Easton told me that the city is trying to close us down. Well, what are we gonna do? First thing in the morning, I'’m going down to City Hall and try to get some answers. MAN: The complaint is about tax expenditure. You should take it up with your district councilman. It took me three days just to get in to see you. [PHONE RINGING] I told you, Mr. Brubaker, we don'’t deal with budgeting matters here. You'’re gonna have to take it up with the school board. But yesterday you said--That was yesterday. Uh, wait a second. The school board didn'’t help you, huh? Why don'’t you try the Department of Parks and Recreation? Mister, I'’ve been here four times, and you sent me to four different places. Every one of them sent me right back here. I'’ve got to see the Deputy Mayor. You'’re gonna have to wait. I'’m prepared. Oh, hi, Peggy. Go right on in. Yes, sir, I will. Have a nice weekend. Mr. Brubaker, I'’m sorry, the Deputy Mayor won'’t be able to see you. But he suggests that you try the Department of Social Services. Mr. Aide, I'’ve been social. Now I'’m gonna get some service. [STAMMERING] Mr. Brubaker, you can'’t do that. DEPUTY MAYOR: What'’s the meaning of this? You can'’t just barge in here like this. Mr. Brubaker, you'’re in trouble now. [SIRENS WAILING] Oh, no. What are you doing here, ma'’am? Well, when the Deputy Mayor called up my school to tell me that one of my employees, who is, in point of fact, not one of my employees, is tearing up city property, I feel that I had to at least come down and see what'’s going on. If you will sign here, we can get out of this place. Um--And don'’t thank me. Right there, sir, and also, you have to sign out for your things. Yes. Don'’t you wanna check that first? That'’s okay. It says here he has keys. Where are his keys? Yeah, keys. I can assure you, Mr. Brubaker, that this kind of irrational behavior is not going to accomplish a thing at city hall. Yes, ma'’am. But--These are bureaucrats. They'’re used to professional form filers and grant getters. They respond to the kind of people who make up their grocery lists in triplicates, the kind of people who are experts in detailed budgets and proposals. Yes, ma'’am, I just-- I bet you don'’t even know how much you'’re asking for. Do you have any idea how much it costs to run your operation for a year? Do you have even the slightest clue? No, ma'’am. Here are your keys. Thank you. [COUGHS] What'’s going on? Somebody die? Just our shot at the title is all. While you were down playing cops and robbers in the slammer, something didn'’t kind of slip your mind? Like the finals game today? Today? So what happened? Nothing. We didn'’t have no adult supervisor to sign us in. So they gave us the bum'’s rush. Forfeited seat. We just hung around to say thanks a lot. Hey, hey, man, I'’m sorry. I'’ll make it up to you. Thanks in advance. Come on, guys, let'’s get out of here. Damn! Well, coach, kinda let the team down. Yeah. So what you gonna do about it? I'’m always preaching to you guys about the importance of learning from your mistakes. I'’ve been sitting here a while, trying to figure out how to learn from this one. So what did they tell you downtown? Downtown. You know what they got downtown? Bureaucrats. And bureaucrats want you to fill out budgets, and forms, and proposals. That'’s all what Denker was good at. Denker, where'’s he at?He split. Said he didn'’t like the atmosphere in this part of town. Boy, could he make out a budget. Is that what you'’re doing, a budget? This ain'’t no budget, this is a mess. But you are Nick the Greek. You can take the mess and turn it into a budget. Oh, I don'’t know about that. Look, Billy, they got an adding machine down at my job. So why don'’t you come to my job, and help me get this mess organized? Uh, I don'’t-- I don'’t know, Bruise. You, know, it'’s getting kinda late. I got other obligations. Look, this won'’t take long, and I'’ll even buy you dinner. Oh, but, Bruise--Don'’t "but" me. If they want grocery lists in triplicate, then that'’s what they'll get. Whatever they want, we'’ll give it. If they want detailed budgets, we'’ll give them that, too. Whatever they want, that'’s what they're gonna get. And we'’re gonna get some money to save the center. BILLY: You ain'’t turning into a bureaucrat, are you? BRUISE: With your help, I am. How fast he is! This child is going to be either a very successful accountant, or a very successful crook. Better be an accountant. These your initials?Yeah. Yeah, you authorized payment on the same thing three times. This is the receipt. You kept on paying it. That'’s what you're here for. [YELLING] [EXCLAIMS] Bruise, don'’t go. Let me call the cops. Benny'’s out there with three guys and they'’re looking for trouble. The way I feel right now, they'’ve come to the right place. [PEOPLE YELLING] Sally, I'’m telling you for the last time. Tell this! You'’re going with me. Come on. [SALLY GRUNTING] Hey, Benny, you take it outside or bring it to me. [SALLY SHRIEKS] Right here. [GRUNTING] [PEOPLE SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] [PEOPLE SCREAMING] Heads up, Bruise. [PEOPLE CHEER AND APPLAUD] Man, you evened out the odds. Yeah, not bad for a bureaucrat, huh? [LAUGHS] Yeah, right. Did you finish what you were doing in the back? Uh, no, not yet. Well, let'’s go, lil' brother, there ain'’t no breaks around here. [PEOPLE APPLAUDING] Okay, here it is. Read it and weep. What'’s the bad news? 25 Gs, no matter how you slice it. You'’re gonna have to get $25,000 to keep that joint going for a year. How'’re you gonna raise that kind of money? Well, if you had 100 Jewish mamas instead of 100 street kids, you'’d have a fund-raiser. What kind of fund-raiser? Oh, you know, a carnival, a benefit, some kind of a fiesta that you charge people to attend, and then sell things. Oh, that sounds cool. Sounds like exactly what we need. But right now it'’s getting late. You better get home before your mother starts to worry about you. What about my dinner? Dinner'’s right here. Eat it on the run. I wanna talk to some of the dancers-- Don'’t you worry about them dancing girls. You just get to the center tomorrow, we got a benefit to plan. All right. All right, I'’ll see you tomorrow, then. I'’ll be going. Sell tickets? People pay to stay out of this part of town. They don'’t pay to come to it. [ALL MURMUR IN AGREEMENT] Sounds like it will work out about as good as the basketball championship. Hold it right there, Jason, I made a mistake, and we got aced out of the finals. But right now we got a bigger fish to fry. Yeah, we probably would have lost anyway. I don'’t know about that, but I do know ain'’t nobody ever accomplished anything by being caught up in self pity. That'’s not what I'm about, and that'’s not what I want you to be about. Now what do you say, are we gonna get down with our own bad selves? ALL: Yeah! All right. I can dig that, but I still don'’t see how we can sell tickets. Maybe I can get a celebrity to come by. They always draw. Yeah, Bruise. Just exactly which one of your celebrity buddies did you have in mind? How about old Tanker Weams? [ALL LAUGH] You'’re going to get the toughest man in the world to come down here? Hey, we'’re like this. Right. And besides, he owes me a favor. How many tickets we gotta sell for this shindig anyway? As many as we can. I was hoping that Nick the Greek'’d come by and help us with that. How come he'’s not here? I don'’t know. He said he was coming. Mr. Brubaker. Yes, ma'’am. [BOYS HOOTING] [SNICKERING] I didn'’t realize that you would come up with such an ingenious solution to your problem so quickly. What do you think? A carnival'’s a pretty neat idea, huh? Well, it would'’ve been nice if someone had asked me. After all, it is my gymnasium. That'’s right. If you don'’t want us to-- You can use the gym. However, you are aware, of course, that you have to have a license? License? Just to hold a benefit? Absolutely. You have to register as a charity, otherwise it'’s illegal. Oh, boy, I'’m not too good with those City Hall deals. Yes, I recall. I suppose that I could help with that part. I appreciate any help I can get. Well, very well. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Oh, Miss Easton. No, no, ma'’am, I'’ve been up for some time. Oh, that'’s great. So now we'’re a legal charity. Thank you. I was wondering, did you get to make that call on Billy Greene? Yeah, we haven'’t seen him all week. Okay, I'’ll check it out. Thank you. No, no, no. I'’m what you call an early riser. [ALARM CLOCK RINGING] [MUFFLED RINGING] Yeah. Thanks a lot. All right. [DOGS BARKING] [BABY CRYING] WOMAN: I told you not to bother me. Oh, who are you? Call me Bruise, Mrs. Greene. I came to see Billy. What'’s he been up to this time? Nothing, I--MAN: Who is it? Who'’s there? Nothing, honey. Be just a minute. Listen, I'’m busy. Okay? Where is Billy? Who knows, and who cares? Did he sleep here last night? Nobody slept.[MAN YELLING] Yeah, I guess I ought to get going. No, please, there'’s no need, honey. Is there? No, guess not. MAN: I ain'’t paying for trouble like that... MRS. GREENE: It'’s all right, it'’s all right. Everything'’s fine. Yo, Bruise. What are you doing here, man? Billy, I'’m looking for you. You sleep here? Yeah, sometimes. Hey, no need for that. I got plenty of room at my place. I ain'’t no charity case. Who'’s talking charity? I need help with this carnival. It'’d be pretty handy to have Nick the Greek with me all the time. Okay. I travel light. [CHUCKLES] Sorry I haven'’t been around lately, but I'’ve had some business to take care of. But I have been thinking about the carnival a lot. Good. Boy, did we miss your knack for numbers. Okay, look, I figured we'’re gonna sell about 3,000 tickets, right? Why not raise the rate to $5 a ticket, turn it into a couple of draw prizes, like a thousand bucks first prize, couple of smaller prizes. You know, in a place like this, hope sells real great. Everybody'’s looking for a way out. [TIRES SCREECHING] Well, lookie here. If it ain'’t The Dude. You'’re a day late on your collections, Dude. It ain'’t like you. Now Matty don'’t want his best runner getting into bad habits. I got it right here. I just didn'’t get around. Hey. You'’re leaning on my car. Oh, really? You'’re causing static on my set. I can'’t get the scores. Mmm. Maybe your antenna needs adjusting. Hey. Hey--See how that works. Hey! [YELLING AND GRUNTING] The name is Bruise. And this kid don'’t need no more of your chump change. He just retired from the numbers game. You listen to me, slick dog, you'’re messing with something that'’s way out of your league. And you, kid, you'’re making a big mistake. I'’m the only friend you got in this neighborhood. Who is that guy? It'’s Matty Toddson. When you live like I live, Matty'’s the man you deal with. Know what I mean? No, I don'’t. Why don'’t you tell me? He'’s a kingpin. The whole neighborhood'’s got them, it'’s just that he'’s bigger than most. More fingers in more pies. He'’s always on the lookout for something extra. So what about the law? Come on, man, he'’s smart. He'’s got a legitimate business he uses as a front. A restaurant supply place or something. It'’s a good cover to wheel and deal. So he knows all the angles, huh? BILLY: Oh, you bet. But you know, Matty is usually cool. I'’ve never seen him blow up like that. You know what you did to his car back there, well, he'’s a mean man with a grudge. BRUISE: Well, he don'’t scare me much. In fact, he don'’t scare me at all. How'’d you get mixed up with him? Did you hear of a thing called money? It'’s that simple. Money. Just like you need money to run that center. Well, some people need money just to simply survive. You know, to eat and stay alive in this crummy world. Quite a speech. [BILLY SIGHS] You asked me, I told you. [PATS BACK] [BILLY SIGHS] BILLY: Hey, this place is pretty cool. Yeah, I like it. Why don'’t you put your clothes by the rack? I gotta change. I got an appointment. So... Your mother have a lot of company, huh? No, not as much as she used to. She is getting too old and the competition'’s getting a little too hot. You done playing Dick Tracy? Yeah, I'’m through. Sorry. So, you pump a lot of iron? I try to stay in shape. Can you lift this one? No, as a matter of fact, I can'’t. It'’s good in life to have a reminder that there are some things you just can'’t do. "From us to Bruise. Without you there would be no '’us'." I can'’t read all them signatures. Hey, easy with that. It'’s one of a kind. So, what'’d you do, save their lives or something? Are you some kind of hero? Nope, I didn'’t do nothing they wouldn'’t have done in the same situation. So tell me, man, what'’s with that haircut? It'’s part of my African heritage. It'’s from the Mandingo tribe. I wish I got a trim. You'’re looking awful sharp. I mean, that must be some errand you got to run. Yeah, Miss Easton called. Said she got a license for us. Oh, great. You'’re going to pick it up? Yeah. She'’s working today. On Saturday? And I suppose you just happened to have them flowers lying around, too? Yeah. Flowers are a nice way to say "Thank you." Are you sure you don'’t need me to come along now? No, no. I think I can handle this alone. Well, don'’t get yourself in anything you can'’t handle. Right. Miss Easton. Hi, what a nice surprise. I thought I might come by and pick up the license. Well, I'’m glad you did. This big barn gets pretty lonely on Saturdays. I just happen to have these for you. Oh, they'’re lovely. How nice. Thank you. Would you like a cup of coffee? I have some made. Yes, ma'’am. Good. These are gonna be perfect on my mantel. [LAUGHS] Here you go. Nice lookin'’ dude. That'’s my husband. He was killed in Vietnam. It wasn'’t a nice place to be. You were in Vietnam?Yes, ma'’am. The marines. Then you must have enlisted. Only to stay out of jail. This judge gave me the choice of signing up or doing time. Doing time? I see. I'’ve been on my own since I was ten. I wasn'’t exactly your model citizen. Well, you certainly seem to be making up for that now. Just trying to do right. It'’s a promise I made to myself when I was in Vietnam. Not everybody keeps those promises. That'’s why that carnival is so important. It'’s part of the promise. Well, at least you have your license. Now all you gotta do is get people to come. I'’m afraid it won't be easy. No, it won'’t. Come on, what are you talking? You don'’t need a thousand bucks? Hey, everybody needs a thousand bucks. Don'’t kid yourself.Fine. All right. Now you'’re exercising your right to good judgment. 25 tickets. Have a nice day. Ah, ladies, we'’re talking a major event. That'’s right. We're talking fun, we'’re talking games, we'’re talking music. We'’re talking muscle, you know, Tanker Weams, the toughest man in the world? Big muscles! Yeah, now we'’re talking money. Steve, why don'’t you just pretend it'’s an offer you can'’t refuse? [SIGHS] All right, Bruise. What about the date? Don'’t you wanna bring a date? Sure. Why not. All right. What about another couple? Don'’t you have some friends? Another couple? Yeah, that'’s a good idea. I'’ll bring another couple. Uh, Steve, what about your mother? No, Bruise. Not my mother. I definitely do not want to bring my mother. You'’re all right, Steve. I like you. I talked to the guy at Ready-Meats, he'’s gonna deliver the hot-dogs directly to the gym tomorrow afternoon. Good, good. We still got a lot to do. What'’s the count? Esther Richards, 91 tickets. Uh, Andy Castillone, 29 tickets, Slick Bartholomew 36, Eddy Morgan, 42, Billy Greene, 365--Wait a minute! How'’d you sell so many tickets? Charm. All, right, let'’s hear it for charming Billy Greene, huh? [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] It'’s pretty good, don'’t you think? I feel like I'’m being used. Tanker, I told Bruise--Hey, man, he'’s building a carnival around me. And I don'’t like it.I made a deal! Charlie, are you my manager?Of course. How many other clients you got? None.Then don'’t forget it. Tanker, we'’ve gotta--We'’ve gotta nothing. Brubaker, you got 30 minutes tomorrow. Understand? One half hour, and I'’m outta here. Better than nothing. BILLY: All right, guys, take it back up. What a jerk. Yeah, some people don'’t handle that celebrity thing too well. Man, you ought to enter that contest, take him down a notch or two. Hey, man, that'’s a tough dude. You'’re crazy. I'’m not crazy. I saw what you did to them poor guys at the club. Ain'’t no way Tanker Weams is tougher than that. It'’s true he may not be my favorite person in the world, but that still don'’t give me a reason to fight him. How about a hundred thousand dollars?A hundred what? Top prize in the tough man contest. Think about it. Hey, Bruise, somebody wants to see you in your office. It'’s the man. Well, better not keep the man waiting. What do you mean, give all the money back? It'’s obtained under false pretenses. It'’s got to be returned. After this, if there are no complaints, we just might not prosecute you. I got a license from the city. Yeah, but it'’s not a license to swindle. I don'’t know what you're talking about, sergeant, and that'’s the truth. In fact, I don'’t think I wanna know. Brubaker, right now, there are at least 20 people who know. Who know that they'’re gonna win that thousand-dollar draw. What do you mean they know they'’re gonna win? Your gang told them the draw was rigged. It'’s not a gang. All right. One of your little angels, then. Told them if they bought 25 tickets, that their number was guaranteed to come up. His name was Billy Greene. Billy? That'’s the name. Got yourself a real loser there, Mr. Brubaker. Right now, you better get busy and make sure that everybody gets their money back. And I'’ll take that. It'’s been revoked. Billy Greene! Boy, you'’re a liar. You swindled those people with tickets and now you'’re trying to swindle us. I...I just-- You just killed any hope we had at keeping this center alive. I thought--You didn'’t think about nothing but yourself. We trusted you, boy. Everyone in this center trusted you. Then you bring the cops in thinking we'’re part of your scam. Now get out of here! Get out of my center. Get out of my apartment. And get out of my life! [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] Your center. I'’m gone. [EASTON] Why don'’t I just warm this up? BRUISE: Yeah... what? Oh... [EXHALES] Oh... What is it? Just a picture. You know... somewhere out there, there is a way for you to keep the center going. Billy seemed to think that you might have a chance at the tough man contest. I don'’t know about that. Well, he'’s been bragging about what you did to those four men at the club, and I saw what you did to that door at the mayor'’s office. I ain'’t too proud about that, ma'’am. Well, no, and you shouldn'’t be. But it does show a rather strong propensity for self-actualization. What'’s that? [LAUGHS] That'’s what my mom used to call bullish determination. You know... I really don'’t have much of an appetite. Maybe I better leave. Just don'’t sell yourself short. $100,000 would go a long way. See you, okay? [MOTIVATIONAL MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] [DICK] Thousand dollars?Call it advertising. The prize is a hundred grand. That'’s enough money to keep my center open for four years. You are my friend, and you are the toughest man that I know. But in the world, I don'’t know. Hey, Dick, I gotta give it a try. And I need your help, buddy. You want my help? Come on, I'’m gonna show you something. [DICK] You know, if you make it through the preliminary competition, you'’re still gonna have to face Tanker Weams. And those aren'’t fists at the end of his arms, those are wrecking balls. That man knows his way around the ring. If you still feel you can do it after this little demonstration, I'’ll back you. Now a good pro has got a dozen ways to embarrass you. His feet, his gloves, his experience... How do you know about all that stuff? I'’ve been coming to places like this every Saturday morning since I was nine-years-old. I'’m what's known as the boxing aficionado. What'’s that? It'’s a guy who likes to watch other guys hit each other. Man, I can'’t fight that little guy. Don'’t you worry about him. He can take care of himself. You just worry about you. [WHISTLE BLOWS] [GRUNTS] [DICK] Come on, now. Put the pressure on him, Bruise. Stay on your feet now. Come on, come on, come on, good balance there. Let'’s go, Bruise. Come on. [GRUNTS] Come on, Bruise. You should hit him for a change. Let'’s go. Come on, come on, don'’t back up. That'’s it. Get him now, Bruise. Get him. Look at that guy. Whoa![WHISTLE BLOWS] Bruise, Bruise, Bruise, stop, stop. It'’s over. The round is over. See what I mean? Even that little guy can blacken your eyes at will. I was born with black eyes. Don'’t get technical on me. You had enough?Of what? Of this, your lesson. I wanted to show you that boxing is a science. Man, Tanker ain'’t no science compared to that flea flicker. He'’s bigger, slower, and more stationary. Fighting him is gonna be rough and tumble. Watch what I mean. See what I mean? MAN: Sex?BRUISE: Man. MAN: Height?BRUISE: 5'’11". MAN: Weight?BRUISE: 213. What are you doing? Taking a physical? Uh, no, Mom. We are entering Bruise in the Toughest Man in the World competition. Oh, terrific! Why didn'’t I think of that? Look at those muscles. And that invincible personal-- What do you mean "we" are entering him? We'’re sponsoring him. How much? Thou.A thousand dollars? Tell me you'’re kidding. A thousand dollars? Sonny, what were you thinking about? Ma, I took him to the gym today, and he'’s not bad. "Not bad" is not good enough. Oh. All right, buster, if we'’re putting up our hard-earned money, you'’re going to go to work, and I mean now! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] BOY: Come on, Bruise. Come on. That'’s it. Come on! [CHEERING ON] No, no, no. He gotta do it by himself. He gotta do it by himself. It'’s okay. It's okay. One more time. We'’ll get it. We'll get it. One more time. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Cover up. You don'’t wanna be hit. Then you'’re gonna get him. You'’re gonna hurt him really bad. Here he comes. Here he comes. Hah! There he is. Hah! There he is. All right, second line, take over. Come on, guys. Let'’s go! Get up! Hang on. Remember, no gain without pain. Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty, sixty-one, sixty-two, sixty-three... Three, four, five, six seven, eight... [GRUNTING] [BOYS CHEERING] [BOYS CHEERING] Everyone decent? I need the mirror. Now look, watch me. [GROWLING] Now your turn. [GROWLS] Bruise, the prelims are tomorrow. You gotta think tough. You gotta defeat their minds before you can defeat their bodies. You gotta go in there thinking like a tiger! Or you'’re gonna get killed. Meow! [GIRLS CHUCKLE] [ALL GROWLING] [GROWLING] More! That'’s it. That's great! We got that. Now, we gotta do something on the visual image. Let'’s see. Welcome back, folks. Once again, this is Larry Burrows. reporting on the final phase of today'’s grueling Toughest Man in the World Elimination. As you can see, it'’s been a rough afternoon for many of the contestants. But the stakes are high in this $100,000 tournament. To see who earns the dubious distinction of the chance to go one-on-one with our defending three-time champion, Tanker Weams. [AUDIENCE CHEERING]Dubious distinction takes on a whole new meaning when you'’re in the spotlight in the ring with this former marine drill sergeant, lumberjack, and pro football player in Canada, until a minor altercation with the law forced his retirement. Tanker, tell me, Is it true that it took half the police force of Moose Jaw to arrest you that time? No, it'’s not true! It took the whole force. And 27 of those pipsqueaks are still in the hospital. There you have it, folks. Right from the champ himself. But think about it. Would you wanna climb into the fight ring with Mr. Weams for a measly $100,000? Not me. But now let'’s talk to the men who will. We started out here this morning with over 200 contestants from around the world. Now the field is less than 20, and after the power-lifting, even fewer will remain. Power-lifting is one of our key events-- How'’s he doing?Shh, shh. So far so good. Weight selection is made-- WOMAN: Ah, there he is! Look at him. He looks gorgeous. I got that costume made. [HOST] Bruise Brubaker, ex-street fighter, former enlisted man, and presently, Sports Director for one of the local youth centers. Hey, you guys, look at this clown. Brubaker is rated high as a major contender. Isn'’t that your friend? He ain'’t my friend. MAN: That'’s the turd who wrecked up your car, Matty. MATTY: Yeah, and you along with it. Making a real jerk of himself in that Halloween getup. I don'’t know. What do you think, kid? About what? He got a chance in this competition? I saw him down at the South Chicago gym. Some welterweight really made a fool out of him. A welterweight, huh? [LAUGHTER] And here we go, the strongest men in the world. [CROWD CHEERING] [GROWLING] [GROANING] [ALL LAUGHING] [GRUNTING] There'’s Bruise! There he is! There he is! Come on, Bruise! You can do it. Come on, Bruise! [GRUNTING] [CHEERING] We'’re proud of you! There you have it. That'’s it folks. Eight have qualified to return here next Saturday for the final event. I don'’t know. This Bruise character looks pretty good to me. What do people think of him? He'’s pretty popular on the South Side. That right, Fox? Oh, yeah. Shoeshine boys, grocery clerks, cleaning ladies. You'’re gonna lay out $250,000, $300,000 easy. So, uh, what'’re you thinking, Matty? I'’m thinking maybe we should get together with Tanker and his manager and uh... talk a little business. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND YELLING] We gotta save something for Tanker. We gotta save some for Tanker. All right!Hey, Bruise, Bruise! If you need a manager, I'’m available. I'’ll remember that, Bobby. Hey! This was Nick the Greek'’s idea. Too bad he'’s not still around to enjoy it. Yeah. That'’s the only thing that'’s missing. I'’m telling you, kid, it'’s easier to catch flies with honey than it is with vinegar. All right.[KNOCK ON DOOR] Let him in. Charlie, come on in. Tanker. Huh? So, how are things? It'’s great.Yeah. So great, in fact, I don'’t know why we'’re here. You'’re here because they could be great. Well, let me ask. Um... What does this title thing do for you? 100 Gs.Plus endorsements. And Auto shows. And all like that. We'’re doing okay.Yeah... if you got a taste for chicken feet. How would you like to be in on a half million action we think we can move on you against Bruise? Being he wins the prelims. If they'’re doing odds ain'’t worth the trouble.I'’m talking even odds. Maybe better. Who'’s the chump?The whole South Side. I got an idea that'’ll sucker every loose buck in town. How does it work? Huh? You tell me you'’re interested, I'’ll tell you how it works. We'’re interested. All right then. Now what I'’m proposing is this. What would happen if Tanker here looked like he wasn'’t going into this title match in a number one shape? A little showbiz twist I got buzzing around in my head. This Bruise character is already doing half our work for us with his monster act. What are you talking about? Ever hear of a little thing called whiplash? You'’re gonna have an accident. And this good Samaritan citizen I happened to know gets you this doc I happen to know. Press grabs it, makes a big deal about Tanker'’s condition. And everybody lays every money on Bruise, because he'’s in better shape. In the meantime, we got ourselves the real winner, in our pocket, healthy and happy. Simple. Hey, Mom. If I give you this money, you'’re gonna spend it on food or... or you want me to go buy it and bring it for you? Where are you coming up with so much loot these days, Mr. Big Shot? [EXHALES] I'’m putting it in your purse, Mom. Just don'’t go spending it on booze or anything. Okay? What'’re you doing snooping around here? The door was open. Can I talk to you? You said it all at the center, man. I mean, no way I deserved that. I'’m sorry, Billy, I just lost my cool. Yeah. I know you lost your cool, in front all of them guys, too. Still, I only did it for you and them. I wanted you guys to like me. I realize that now, Billy. You were just trying too hard. I had my hopes too high. So we both blew it. Don'’t touch me. Don'’t come near me, you muscle-bound fake. I see right through you. You'’re always preaching to them guys, "Now you gotta go to school and you gotta learn." You can'’t read or write two words, can you? You can'’t read and you can'’t write. I saw what you did to the bills. It'’s true, Billy. I can'’t read or write. That'’s why I refuse to let you or any kid from the center go through life with the same handicaps that I got. Well, you'’re just breaking my heart, man. I don'’t need you or your stupid philosophies. We need you. This whole tough man thing was your idea. I'’d like for you to see it through with me. [HORN TOOTING] I gotta go. I'’m coming up in the real world. You mind? I got company coming. [GRUNTING] Hey, Bruise. How'’s it going? [EXHALES] I don'’t know, man. I think I'’m licked. Ah, come on.Hey, man, I mean it, Dick. I'’ve trained real hard, I'’m faster, I'm stronger, but this wall got me beat. I don'’t know why. Hey, Bruise, look, come on, you gotta keep at it. Hey, man, I'’ve been here since 6:00 this morning. Here you come up at 10 o'’clock, trying to give me some pep talk and get me to work harder. I don'’t know about you, buddy. Just get over there. You got a wall to climb. Okay, come on. Get ready. Get tough. And... go! Go! Go, go, go! Now, get it, pull! Pull, Bruise, come on! Pull! [GRUNTS] All right, now pull. You got it. Pull! Okay, that'’s better. Okay. Okay, pal. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Oh, hi.Hello. Come in. Thank you. What are you doing here? The boys said that you went to see Billy. What happened? Uh, he didn'’t want nothing to do with me. Says he'’s gonna make it on the streets now. Seems that'’s my enemy. I'’m always fighting the streets. You sure are. The only chance you got to keep the fight going is to concentrate on tomorrow. Yeah. What a long shot. Bruise, you'’ve been a long shot all your life. Um... My mother gave me this charm when I went away to college. Here. You carry it with you tomorrow. For luck. This is Larry Burrows, at the Chicago Colosseum. What an air of excitement and anticipation as we await the arrival of our eight finalists in the Toughest Man in the World competition. Right now our contestants are in the final leg of the 10K run, which will end right here in the stadium. But the real news today is the man one of them will face in the ring two weeks from today in a free-for-all boxing match. Tanker, I don'’t think there's a person watching who hasn'’t heard or read about your auto accident and the medical updates on your whiplash. How do you feel? Oh, Larry, I'’m standing on my own two feet. I guess we can say, "So far, so good." What'’s the doctor's prognosis for your readiness in two weeks? I don'’t think there's any spinal injury. The doctor let me pretty much decide for myself whether I'’ll be in that ring. The rules say that if you fail to show, you forfeit the match. I can tell you one thing, I'’m not losing this title by default. Isn'’t that great, folks? That'’s what true champions are made of. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Oh, I'’m so excited! [LAUGHS] Now, Tanker, let'’s talk about how this competition works. As you know, Larry, it'’s supposed to be a test of endurance to see if there'’s a stamina to go against me. As I understand it, there will be no recuperative breaks between events. The competitors will go directly from one exhausting event to the next. Ladies and gentlemen, the contestants are entering the arena. [CHEERING] [WHISTLE BLOWS] LARRY: As you know, Tanker, each of these events is timed against performance. The highest number of points going to the man who accomplishes the most in the allotted time. [BUZZER BUZZES] [CROWD CHEERING] [DICK] Okay, Bruise. You'’re looking good. You'’re looking good. How do you feel? I'’m real tired. Real tired. Okay, you need to breathe. You gotta get the oxygen for your muscles. Thanks, Dick. I don'’t know what I'’d do without you. Sorry, I'’m just getting excited here. Now long, steady pulls. Hang in there. Long, steady pulls. Come on, let'’s go. Why do they make them do everything so fast? Why don'’t they let them rest? It'’s the way it's designed. They'’re trying to wear them out. Oh. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Aw, kid, looks like your man'’s losing his grip. [CROWD CHEERING] Folks, this has to be one of the toughest fields of contenders I have ever seen. Four of the eight contenders have just tied with an incredible 111 push-ups each in two minutes. Tanker, it certainly looks to me, like you'’re gonna have your work cut out for you. TANKER: Sure. That'’s true. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Stop, Bruise. Stop! Stop it. He whistled. Stop! If that guy'’s brain is as big as his muscles, he'’d be a millionaire. LARRY: Doyle just turned in 129 chin ups, followed by Casey at 124, and Brubaker at 121. Brubaker got a bad break at the start when he slipped off the bar. Yes, he did. Bruise, defeat their minds. Remember what Mom told you? Defeat their minds. [CROWD CHEERING] [WHISTLE BLOWS] Come on, Bruise. LARRY: Of course, arm wrestling has no timer. The contest runs until four men have won and four men have lost. It is the final event before the all-important obstacle course. [DICK] Come on, Bruise, come on. [CROWD CHEERING] Come on, Bruise. Defeat their minds. [GRUNTING] [CHEERING] Thanks, Bobby. I needed that. You played wonderful, buddy. What'’s the count? It'’s not the best, Bruise, but it'’s definitely not the worst. Just tell me what I got to do.Win. Right now there'’s two guys ahead of you by a point. Second place isn'’t gonna do you any good. But if you win the obstacle course, you move into first place, then you'’ll have your shot at Tanker. CROWD: Hey, Bruise! Get down with your bad self! [CHEERING] Okay, guys, let'’s go, let's go. [MURMURING] Gonna get him. He'’s the one. Come on. Come on. Come on. We'’ll get him. TANKER: All assume positions. Take your mark... set... [PISTOL FIRES] [CROWD CHEERING] Whoa! Put your helmet on. Put your helmet on-- Who'’ll be the first out the pit now? Doyle, Casey, and Brubaker are all out at the same time. They'’re out together and they'’re racing toward the wall. Coming toward the wall, Casey and Doyle... What happened? What'’s the matter? What'’s going on? Brubaker... What'’s Brubaker... I don'’t know. I don'’t know. Oh, my God, Brubaker has run in through the wall, ladies and gentlemen! Absolutely incredible. [CROWD CHEERING] You did it! Hey. This is going down just the way we wanted. Let'’s get out of here. Come on. Hey, Matty.Hey, it'’s The Dude. Looks like we struck gold, one block alone. That'’s great, but I got a guy here I think you should talk to. Remember I told you about that little welterweight that gave Bruise a hard time at South Chicago gym? Hmm.This is him. Gus. He'’s got something to tell you. Go ahead. I kinda think old Bruise might be able to take Tanker. He'’s putting 20 bucks on Bruise. Wait a minute. The way I heard it, you danced his pants off, took out the stitches. Well, true enough. The kid should have stuck around though '’cause Bruise has got a flow, a natural sense of boring in. And he'’s training real hard. Thought you should know. Great. Great. Fine time to find out. I'’m gonna need some insurance. A no-show forfeits the match, Matty. If he'’s a no-show, all the bets are off. We don'’t make a dime. Oh, yeah. [SIGHS] Bruise has got to show. We just got to make sure he'’s not in such a good shape. Right? Right. Right. BRUISE: Ain'’t nobody closing down my center for my kids. LESLIE: They already did. They already did. They already did. Somewhere out there, there is a way for you to keep the center going. BILLY: How about $100,000. Top prize in the tough man contest. Think about it. BRUISE: I can'’t read or write. That'’s why I refuse to let you or any kid from the center go through life with the same handicaps that I got. DICK: Ma, I took him to the gym today, and he'’s not bad. ESTHER: "Not bad" is not good enough. LESLIE: Bruise, you'’ve been a long shot all your life. DICK: You'’re still gonna have to face Tanker Weams. And those aren'’t fists at the end of his arms, those are wrecking balls. [EXHALES] Bruise, you are my friend, and you are the toughest man that I know. But in the world, in the world, in the world... MATTY: Lose the kid'’s name. You'’re move in inside, upstairs. How about "Big Time Billy Greene"? BILLY: Sure, why not? You got any butterflies, kid?What for? That a boy. You sure he'’s gonna be there? Hey, I do my homework. He'’s gonna leave from the club. You guys go over to the club and wait. Give '’em a couple of minutes to get over there and then you make the call. Yeah, sure. The call. Everybody, listen up and listen good, because I'’m only gonna say this once. Whatever happens out there today, I want everybody to see and say that the kids at my center reflect the good of the neighborhood. Okay? [ALL MURMUR IN AGREEMENT] Hold it, hold it! I don'’t mean "okay" like I'’m asking for your opinion or something. I mean "okay" like you better get it through your thick skulls. All right? [ALL SHOUT IN AGREEMENT] All right. This is for us. All right. All right. This is for us. We can do it! Oh, kid... when he gets here, there'’s gonna be a small tussle. We'’ll slip a needle to him. He won'’t even know it. Then we apologize all around. You go off with him, and Tanker beats him to a pulp. Get Bruise over here, kid, you got yourself a real great future. We'’re gonna win it for the center.[PHONE RINGING] We'’re going to win it for ourselves! [ALL CHEERING] [PHONE RINGING]All right, all right. This is it, for us. Bruise, telephone. You better get this. Come on, hurry up. Come here. Come on. It'’s Billy. Hello? Hello, Bruise. Yeah. Yeah, this is Billy. I am kinda in trouble. Matty'’s got me locked up. Oh, wait a minute. Come on. This is Matty. Your kid isn'’t joking. You want what'’s good for him? Get over here right away. Never mind where here is. If it'’s all taken care of, I'’ll let him go with you okay? I just wanna talk to you first. Don'’t worry. We'’ll get you to the fight. Just go out. My limo'’s waiting for you. They know where to take you. Yeah, sure. I'’ll put him back on. Bruise? Billy, stay cool. I'’ll be right there. He'’s coming. All right. I don'’t have time to explain. You all take the bus to the stadium. I'’ll meet you there. Where are you going? It'’s Billy. I let him down once, I can'’t do it again. I'’ll see you all later. [ALL MURMURING] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, there'’s been a-- Hang on, hang on, there'’s been a little change in plans. We'’re gonna wait here, he'’s gonna go on ahead. We'’ll take the bus over to the stadium later. [ENGINE STARTS] All right, Billy boy, let'’s get downstairs, huh? The party'’s about to go. I think you should get the point, huh? Yeah. There. Yo, Matty, what'’s with all the muscle, man. I thought you were just gonna zing him with the needle. Billy boy, I'’m a man who believes in insurance. Depends on how much steam he lets out of him. Yeah, a good punch in the belly don'’t leave no permanent damage. What kind of permanent damage is a needle gonna do? Nothing you gotta bother your head with. Hello, Matty. Why aren'’t you guys at the Colosseum? I, uh... think we ought to talk a little business. Wait for a minute. What kind of business? Well, you kept on about insurance, suddenly we ask ourselves, "Hey, what about our insurance?" We'’d like a down payment before he gets to the ring. MATTY: [SARCASTICALLY] I carry 50 to 100 Gs in my wallet. Mm... this looks like a prosperous business. Do you have a safe here? Okay... Okay... Twenty five big ones will show you I'’m sincere? Uh, yeah. I'’d, uh, call that a nice gesture on your part. Dick, hurry. Hey. Who'’d you call?Nobody. Really? Ma, call the police and tell them to get down to Matty Toddson'’s office as quick as possible. [YELLING] [LAUGHS] Grab that kid. Grab him! Come on. Billy, you okay? Yeah.Tanker, what you doing here? No, he'’s with them. They'’re trying to dope you up before the fight, and he'’s on it with them. The kid is leaving with me. You and the kid are leaving when and how I say. Grab him. [YELLS] [GRUNTING] Billy! Stay out of it. Come on. Bruise! [BRUISE GRUNTING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Get down. Everybody, down! Come on. [INDISTINCT YELLING] Come on, get them, get them.Let'’s go. Come on, over there. Aw, sorry. Here, come on. Come on. Help me! Take care of the kid. He knows too much! Let go of him! All right, Brubaker. This is it. Get him, get him! [YELLING] Tanker, no! Boy, it'’s good to have you back! Duck! [ALL CHEERING] ALL: Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it! [ALL CHEERING] How'’re you doing?Fine, how about you? Never better. Well, looks to me like you just won $100,000. We just won. Let'’s go collect. I guess it'’s about time to give your knife back.I don'’t need it. I thought you said your father gave it to you.I lied. But I'’ll never do it again. [SIRENS WAILING] [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Bruise, sorry we missed the action. That'’s okay, Ernie. We handled it ourselves. Look, I got enough colleagues here, lemme take care of these bums, I'’ll give you a ride down the Colosseum.Okay. Come on, guys, let'’s not keep our money waiting. Yes, because you have a youth center to run. Hey, who is that guy?You don'’t know? That'’s the toughest man in the world! [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
