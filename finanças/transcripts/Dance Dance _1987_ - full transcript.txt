Drink this Ramu. No. I will not take bitter medicine. I will eat sweet meal. If you don't take medicine how will your fever subside? - I said I won't drink it. - How is our good son's health? - Son, how is your health now? - I am fine. Mom, he's not taking medicine. He asks for sweet meal. I knew it, dear. That's why I've brought this sweet meal for my son. Eat son. Eat sweet meal. Good. - Darling, you too eat. - No. - Eat it. - No. Eat it. Very good. Dad, today you look very happy. Yes, son. After a long time, your mother and I have got a song programme. But son, we have to go to Jalpaiguri. But will we leave Ramu in this condition? No, Mom, you go. We need money urgently. Yes, Mom. The landlord was here twice since morning. He will come again. It's just a matter of two days. I will look after Ramu. Really? - Hello, Mr. Shyam. - Hello, Mr. Lala. - Hello, Mrs. Sita. - Hello, Mr. Lala. You had called me on this day, didn't you? Yes, Mr. Lala, but I'm sorry. There you go again. Mrs. Sita, you've said sorry many a times. If I don't get my rent today, I'll get this house vacated. Lala, it's not like that. Why don't you keep this Rs.200? - Rs.200? - Yes. You owe me Rs.1200 as rent. We've got Jalpaiguri's programme today. - On returning, we will pay you Rs.1000. - Yes. Look Mr. Shyam, this is your last chance. If you don't pay up on returning... - ...the consequences will be very bad. - I'll surely pay you. This is... Can't pay the rent, but are eating sweet meal. - My sweet meal! - Son, when we return from Jalpaiguri... ...we will give you lots of sweet meal. I don't feel like going. What can we do, Sita? We are helpless. - Radha, take care of your brother. - Okay, Mom. Mom, here's a letter. Don't open it now. Open it before the programme starts. Should we leave? - Okay, dear. - Give me the bag. Be careful. - Come. - Okay. - Ta-ta. - Bye-bye. - Ta-ta. - Ta-ta. Get in. - Let's go, driver. - Son, take the medicine regularly. - Bye. - Bye. Mom, come soon. Ramu, take rest. You are unwell. Start. Come on, boys. 'Mom, on stage if you sing my song...' '...then your programme will be a big hit.' 'Song is "Zu Zu Zubi Zubi Zubi.'" 'Yours, Ramu.' "Whenever I think of you." "It reminds me of your song." "When grief worries my heart." "This is the song which comes on my lips." "Zu Zu Zubi Zubi Zubi." "Zu Zu Zubi Zubi Zubi." "Zubi Zubi Zubi." "O my heart, just sing, Zu Zu Zubi Zubi Zubi." "Sing with joy, Zu Zu Zubi Zubi Zubi." "O my heart, just sing, Zu Zu Zubi Zubi Zubi." "Sing with joy, Zu Zu Zubi Zubi Zubi." "Zubi Zubi Zubi."

"Zubi Zubi Zubi." "Zubi Zubi Zubi." "Zubi Zubi Zubi." "Zubi Zubi Zubi Zu Zu." Now I will request Mr. A.M. Singh... ...to come on stage and congratulate the musical troupe. Raja Bahadur, A. M. Singh. Young men, ladies and gentlemen. I am a music lover. The sound of music is so magical... ...it brings a dead person to life. Listening to good music and to watching good dancing... ...sends a tickling sensation through my body. The truth is that after watching today's programme... ...my heart is unsatisfied. Thirst has been increased. Since you are in my city... ...I request the artists... ...to stay in my palace for a few days as special guest. So that I can enjoy the pleasure of your dance and songs. I'm sorry, Sir. But we don't do private shows. Can I ask you why? Because music needs temple or this stage. It's indeed very sad news. I can't make Amar palace into either a temple or a stage. Yes, I can pay you for your art. Rs.20000, 30000, 40000, whatever you demand. No, Sir. It's not about money, it's about principles. It's your wish. Nobody can force an artist. However, as I said, you are my guest and are in my city... ...ladies and gentleman, give a big round of applause to these artists. Thank you. Come on. Come on, get out! You too! Come on! Come out! - Don't act smart. - But what will you get from us? A. M. Singh wants to hear this girl's songs. Sing. Sing! "The rich are consumed with merriment." "The poor are helpless." "These stone-hearted wealthy people..." "...Don't understand our emotions." "Zubi Zubi Zubi Zu Zu Zubi Zubi Zubi." "Zubi Zubi Zubi Zu Zu." "Our hearts would be able to do nothing." "We will have a hard death." "We will tolerate this grief with a smile." "We will sing till we are dead." "O my heart, just sing, Zu Zu Zubi Zubi Zubi." "Zubi Zubi Zubi." "Zubi Zubi Zubi." "Zubi Zubi Zubi." "Zubi Zubi Zubi." "Zubi Zubi Zubi." Let me go! - Let her go, you rascal! - No. I'll imprison this beautiful voice in our palace. Leave her, you bastard! - Let me go. - Let her go! Guards, put the rest of the troupe in the bus... - ...and push them in the valley. - No! No! "Zubi Zubi Zubi." Do you know where your parents are? They've not returned yet. - They'll be here soon. - No, they won't. Look what's written here. They are dead. Their bus fell in the valley. All of them died. Now get out of here. - I say get out. - No. I've lost Rs.1000. Don't throw us out. - I'll pay you the rent. - Don't throw us out. You? If they had wanted to pay the rent... ...they would have died after paying it. - Come on, get out here. Beggars. - No! Couldn't pay the rent, but brought sweet meal for their children. Go and beg. Mind your businesses. This is not some show. Come on. Go away. Take care. Sit here, Ramu. God, what should I do? Radha, I'm very hungry. Bring some food. Sweet meal! Sweet meal! Ramu! Ramu! Ramu! Eat, son. You're not eating anything. Aunt, my brother is very hungry. Please give me some food. Get lost! Don't an evil eye on my son. Go away. Ramu! Ramu! Ramu take. Ramu take. "Here he comes.

"Here comes the sweets seller." "Here he comes. Here he comes." "Here comes the sweets seller." "Sister, it would have been so nice..." "...If there would be a mountain of sweet meal." "When all the children would feel hungry..." "...They would eat the sweet meal." "Then nobody would cry out of hungry." "There would neither be dacoits or thieves." "There wouldn't be any fighting..." "...Black market or robbery." "Here he comes. Here he comes." "Here comes the sweets seller." "Here he comes. Here he comes." "Here comes the sweets seller." "To quench our hunger." "To quench our thirst." "Here he comes. Here he comes." "Here comes the sweets seller." Ramu! Ramu! Get up! Ramu! Ramu! I'll bring food for you. Ramu, don't leave me.

You are a hidden talent. Bring this card to my office. - I am a producer. - Take this. I will make you the darling of India. Take this, divide this among you. - Ramu. - This is ours. Ramu! Ramu wake up, tea is getting cold. Boil it again. Till then I will sleep. I've boiled it six times. Are you getting up or not? Get up. Take this. Look, I've brought English book for you. I don't want to study. I'll make you study. Come on. You will teach me? You don't know how to read and write. I know enough to teach you.

In your school, it might be 'A' for apple. In my sister's school, it is 'A' for seb. Come on, get going. Now teach me. Ramu, why don't we join a school? What for? To make progress in life it is essential to speak English. I know English. - You know English? - Yes. Speak. - Shall I show you? - Yes. You think, if I want to say.. "Radha, when I see you, I miss my mother very much." Now I'll speak in English. 'Radha, I seeing you, I remembering my mother.' What English! Ramu, I miss mother too much. A mother is such a thing. Lucky are those, who have a mother. But I have a mother. You're no less than a mother. Did you see that old lady? She's hiding in the bushes. We will kill her the moment we see her. No. I've enjoyed countless girls in my life. But she was totally different. What a beautiful dancer! What a melodious singer! I've spent some beautiful moments with her. Those moments are still alive in her. Let her live. Let her live. - But she shouldn't go out of my area. - Yes, sir. Let her wander in this jungle for the rest of her life. Come on.

I will make you dance in such a way... ...you'll not feel like dancing ever after. Waiter! Yes. Come on, get up. Take this. I'm ruined! - Please pay Rs. 400 for all these damages. - Yes, I'll give it right away. Very good, Ramu. Eat this. I'm ruined! Is there someone? Come. Come. Take this. You tattooed a heart on your face. - What happened to you? - What else? Empty pocket, empty stomach and bad luck. All empty! Is this life? I don't have money for my mother's treatment. And we don't have enough food. Yes. What if we gain nothing walking on the path of honesty? Then be dishonest. Then I have a plan. - What? - Blue Heaven Hotel. - Blue Heaven Hotel? - Yes.

I don't know how you'll do it. But if you meet him, you will definitely become something. Where is he staying? - Hotel Hilton, room no.612. - Hotel Hilton, room no. 612. And listen, he is organising an "All India Talent Contest." But remember one thing. Old man is very rude and heart patient also. That's why don't make him too happy... ...nor make him angry. - You mean, something in the middle. - Yes. Yes, we understood. My dear, I am perfectly all right. Medicine? I never forget to take it. Look, it is right in front of me. Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. You've brought food? Okay. Come after half an hour. To collect the trolley and your tips. Why are you standing here?

Exactly after ten minutes my wife will call... ...to ask whether I've eaten or not. - Come on, Sir. - Come on. You can leave. - Thank you, Sir. - Goodbye. - Thank you. - Goodbye.

There are ten days left for the final dance competition. In ten days, they will be a crowd here, Junita baby. And the result of this final will be decided by me. If you have won me over, then what's so special about the final. I have to win this competition. I'm fed up of dancing at cheap pubs. No one watches how I dance. Everyone tries to peep inside my clothes. - It's disgusting. - I know. I know! It is disgusting. Please sit down. You're couple of days late, baby.

Do one thing. Go to the office and meet Brij Mohan. We met him, but he.. Mr. Binjo said that the finalists have been decided... ...and we will not get a chance. What? Audition cannot be done? Selection has been done? Does Brij Mohan have no respect for my husband's promise? Rest assured, I will talk to him.

"The stars are in your favour." "Whoever you might be, you're facing me." "I'm no less than you are." "You're yet to see my true colours." "I'll present you with such a spectacle." "The heights that you've reached today, my dear." "I want to reach them too." "Oh Romeo. Romeo." "Oh Romeo. Oh Romeo." "I'll prove myself." "I'll achieve such wonderful feats..." "...Which have never been achieved before." "I'll sing tunes..." "...To make every heart skip a beat." "The world would be in love with me." "You're a sweet tormentor." "I'll prove to be the same one day." "Oh Romeo. Romeo." "Oh Romeo. Oh Romeo." Please come in, sir. Come. Don't you worry, Ratna. We'll do Mr. DK's job. "Janeo. Oh, Janeo." "Janeo. Oh, Janeo." "You sing such beautiful songs..." "...That can rule every heart." "You dance like the strike of lightning." "Oh, my dearest, you're so elegant." "There's a crazy intoxication in you." "Why wouldn't the world be mad after you?" "Oh, my love, I do believe..." "...That day is not far when your stars will favour you too." "Janeo. Oh Janeo." "Janeo. Oh Janeo." "Romeo. Romeo." "Romeo. Oh Romeo." Has the car broken down? - Hi, baby. - Hi. - Don't remove your make-up, Baby. - Why? Because I want to introduce you... ...to three friends of the owner of this hotel, Mr. DK. They're very rich people. VIPs. No. I don't want to meet anybody. Now if you go out, I could change. No, Baby. You must meet them today... ...and you must please them too. Understand? You're misunderstanding. Every dancer is not a prostitute. Baby, you can't go. Manik. How dare you touch me? I'm just a trainer, Baby. A mare must be trained before she can run a race. My hand. Now it's okay. Romeo. - There it goes again. - Romeo. - Romeo, please save my honour. - What? Please save my honour. Honour. If I save your honour, would you put the key in the lock? - Yes, I will. - Yes. It's okay. Till I save your self-respect, you put the key in the car. Where is he? Brother, just a minute. I'm saving the girl's honour. Don't interfere. - Come on. - Hey, didn't I tell you? I am saving the girl's honour. Don't interfere. You keep trying. Hey, drunkard. Why are you inviting your own death? What? How much have you drunk? Sixteen pegs. Sixteen pegs? And you're up to saving the girl's honour, are you? - Yes. - Save your own life first, you drunkard. No. First I will save the girl's honour... ...and then will I save my own life. Hey, Brother. Why! You've already lowered me by four pegs! Hey. Wait. You've lowered me by eight pegs in two punches. I see. Give me another two, and get done with the other eight pegs. Take this. Is it gone? Absolutely. Now you are gone. You keep trying. I'll do him the honour. Hey. What is it? As good as four pegs down? Now this one is worth 12 pegs. Okay, now this one is worth 16 pegs. How many pegs down? Sixteen. Look, Brother. I'm done with saving girl's honour. Now should I save my own life? Oh, he's knocked out. I made a mistake. He is not a man of 16 pegs, he is a man of 12 pegs. Hey, forgive me! I beat you one time more. Yes. I've saved your honour. Thank you. Okay. Did the key fit in? Are you hurt? Don't change the topic. First tell me, did the key fit in? Yes. See, it's working. Should I drop you home? Yes. Who all are there in your family? One sister. Please. Please. How dare you? Dare you misbehave with my sister. How dare you? Ramu, what are you doing? - I'll kill him. - Leave him. - I'm telling you the truth, I love him. - No. - Radha. I'm sorry, Radha. - Ramu. - Forgive me. - Ramu. - I don't know how.. - No. Resham. Not Resham. Call me brother-in-law. Very soon, we are going to get married. - Yes. - No. Come. - Hello. - Hello. - Good morning. - Good morning. I had gone home, then I came to know that early morning you have come here. No one else is here yet. I felt lonely at home without Radha. So I thought I'd rather start with the rehearsals. You're doing very well, but there's a lot more hard work to go. We have so many bookings for next year that.. Have a look.. If we have to reach everywhere on time, we'd have to charter a plane. Yes. Look... but.. Yes, I know. There has to be one of your 'buts' some place or the other. Look, my dear friend. Life is full of ifs and buts. Look, Romeo. Radha has married, and started a new life. Now you need to search for a girl who can be your heroine. "I want to reach them too." "Oh Romeo. Romeo." You'll have one by tomorrow. - Hi, Brown uncle! - Hi. - This is Junita. - Hello. Hello. I know I know. I've seen her. From today she is joining our group. - Boys and girls, this is Junita. - Hello. This is Javed, Anita, Sonu, Shehnaz, Shalu. Let's start from today. - Ready, Uncle. - Oh yes. Boys and girls. One, two, three go.. Come on. Driver. Stop the car here. Do you stay here? Yes. Why? Because this locality is not fine for a lonely and decent girl. Come. I'll show you your room. Till now, it was the guest room. Now onwards, it's yours. Without your permission, no one can enter this room. Not even me. Thanks a lot. Thanks for what? In this city, I've lived a poor... ...worried, and helpless life too. What would be the rent? Whatever you can afford. Okay. You take rest... ...and prepare for tomorrow's show. Bye. Bye. It's impossible to defeat Romeo. It is become too difficult. Tickets for his show last night were sold at really high rates in the black market. Until Romeo meets a downfall, our company won't make any profits. Mr. Banjo, Romeo is an artist. That's right... ...and the simplest way to destroy any artist... ...is to trouble him mentally. I don't understand. I am sure there's someone extremely important in your Romeo's life. Yes. His sister, Radha. Is she unmarried? No, no. She's married. To whom? Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Mr. Resham, isn't it strange? Since childhood you supported Romeo. You married his sister... ...and did him a huge favour. You are a great man. But what reward did you get for this greatness of yours? Romeo became rich and famous... ...while you just remained his sidekick. Very unfortunate. But still all is not lost. I have excellent plans for you. You become a partner in our recording company. Here's a cheque of Rs.125,000. Advance. A small share of our company's profit. But... what would my investments be? What I will have to do? Simple. Our recording company can't succeed... ...till Romeo meets a downfall. You must help us do away with Romeo. How's that? Romeo loves his sister Radha a lot. You must trouble Radha, in order to trouble Romeo. But Radha is my wife. Mr. Resham. Nothing in this world comes without a price. Once you are our partner, you'll see. You'll be wealthier than Romeo. Okay? Excuse me. I have a very important meeting, I have to go. Banjo! The way you did hospitality with me... ...in the same way show him the same beauty. Of course. Of course. Mr. Resham is our partner now on. Right? Bye bye. Welcome. Welcome. Hi. Have you taken my jewellery, darling? Naturally, darling. Who else could have taken it? Darling, what's this yours and mine? When you're mine, all that belongs to you is mine as well. Yes. I am yours, but Ramu had given me that jewellery. Darling, he's your brother. Why are you.. Look, tell me where the jewellery is. I don't know. I only know that I sold the jewellery, and lost the money in a race. And darling, let me make one thing very clear. I haven't married you... ...I've married your brother's bank balance. You'll get the money, and I'll spend it. Never. Now all this will never happen again. Never. Get one thing straight, my dear Radha. Don't you dare to refuse me ever again! - Hi. - Hi. - Where's Radha? - Upstairs. - Hey. - Come, Ramu. Come. Come on. Close your eyes. Close. Now... open them. What is this? Ramu this is not done. Must you bring expensive gifts every time you come? Just not done. Oh, my stupid brother... ...save some money for my would be sister-in-law. No. The enjoyment I feel in giving you... ...it's not there in giving anyone else. Do you remember... ...both of us have been hungry together? Together we feared for our future. We roamed the heartless streets together. That doesn't mean you squander everything you earn on me. Who am I earning all this for? Take this. No, Ramu. I won't. Swear by me... ...that you'll never bring me such expensive gifts again. Are you happy? Why wouldn't I be happy? I'm very happy. I married the man of my choice. I'm the only sister of a famous star... ...who has given me a huge bungalow to live in... ...and expensive clothes to wear. There is a boxful of jewellery. What else do I need to be happy? But if you want to see me happier... ...please don't bring such expensive gifts for me. Now you've started lying to me. No. I'd rightly heard that Resham has started gambling. Resham hits you. This blood is mine. Mine. This blood is mine. I'll kill him. No. No. Such words don't suit you. He is your brother-in-law. He is my husband, Ramu. Please. I don't have anyone else other than Radha to call my own. She is not only a sister, but also a father... ...a God and a mother to me. Radha is elder to me. She has raised me like a mother does. She went hungry, so that I could eat. Stop your lecture. Come to the point. Resham, you're my friend. There's no shame in telling you the truth. Whenever you feel like hitting Radha... ...hit me instead. Take whatever I have. Wealth, riches, my life. Take everything. But please don't make Radha cry. Here's a blank cheque. You can cash as much as you want out. If this doesn't suffice, let me know. I beg of you, Resham. Don't hurt Radha. She has already suffered so much. Now bowl, and see how I hit a sixer. Come on, quick. Here I go. I'll treat everyone to chocolates, toffees and lollipop. Today is a good day! Come on. Now I'll keep this telephone here... ...and pick up the receiver... ...and my lovely wife, with her delicate fingers... ...will call her brother... ...and she'll tell her brother. Brother. His only sister needs Rs. 1,50,000. And his brother would come running with the lolly. Here, it's ringing. Hello. I'm sick of asking my brother for money every month. You lose the money, and my brother pays for it. No. This is not going to happen anymore. Why wouldn't it happen? Even today it will happen. Tomorrow also it will happen. And day after tomorrow also it will happen. Otherwise I will break your delicate neck... ...and I will put it in your hands. Kill me if you want to. But I will not demand money from my brother. How won't you? You won't? Call him. - No. - Call your brother. Like this. Call him. No. I won't. Call him. - No. I won't. - Call him. - No. I won't. - You won't? No. I won't. I'm going out. Call your brother for the money in the meanwhile. Whom you are calling? I was calling Radha to invite her for the show... ...but the line has been engaged. May be she is talking to someone. You get ready, and you leave for the show. I'll get Radha and Resham there. Okay. You'll still say that you tripped, and fell? Ramu, let it be. - Forget it. - How should I? There is so many marks on my beautiful sister's face... ...and I should forget it. No, Sister. As long as your brother is alive, nobody will treat you like this. No, Ramu. Swear on me. Romeo. Junita. Why hasn't Romeo arrived yet? - Romeo. - We want Romeo. We want Romeo. Romeo. There he is, but in what state? - Romeo, what are you doing? - Leave me. Have you gone crazy? Hit him. Hit him. Come here. - Go, and start the show. - But Uncle.. If we don't start the show immediately... ...the crowd would burn the theatre. ...and that fire would light the pyre of Romeo's fame. Please go. Go all of you. Go. Please go. Try to win the hearts of the people. Hit him. "With rosy lips, pink as a fresh rose bud.." "With eyes adorned with numerous dreams." "With a delicate body warm as a gentle flame." "I've come..." "...For you." "Just for you." "Just for you." "Just for you." "Don't break my heart." "I'm waiting, all decked up..." "...Suppressing the fire in my heart." "My heart has been so restless." "Do something, my love." "Don't break my heart." "Don't break my heart." "Please don't." "I'm waiting, all decked up..." "...Suppressing the fire in my heart." "My heart has been so restless." "Do something, my love." "Don't break my heart." "Please don't." "Since years I am burning." "I am walking on the flame." "Only you could extinguish the fire burning in my heart, beloved." "Don't break my heart." "Don't break my heart." "Please don't." "Why do you keep distance?" "What is it that grieves you so?" "Why are you so troubled?" "Where are you lost?" "Don't break my heart." "Don't break my heart." "Don't break my heart." "Please don't." "Come close to me." "Try my love." "Test me if you don't have faith." "Hey. Come on, everybody." "Say it. Sing with me." "I love you, babe. Do you love me?" "Well, then show it!" "Let's see you moving. Come on." "That's nice." "I love you, honey. Do you love me?" "Come on. Dance with me." "Come on, everybody." "With youthful tunes of the heart." "I've come here for you." - "My heart... don't break it." - "Don't break it." - "My heart... don't break it." - "Don't break it." "With the elegance and excitement." "I've come here for you." - "My heart... don't break it." - "Don't break it." "Don't break my heart." "Don't break my heart." "Don't break my heart." "Don't break my heart." "Please don't." "Don't break my heart." "Don't break my heart." "Don't break my heart." "Please don't." "Don't break my heart." "Don't break my heart." "Don't break my heart." "Please don't." "Don't break my heart." "Don't break my heart." Well done. Well done. Well done, my boys and girls. No. No. No. Please. Please get out. No. Please no. You're not allowed, please. Please, go out. Please, go out. Please. Please, I beg of you. Please, I request you. Please go out. Please go out. Please. Don't come in. Please. Please, we want autograph. Excuse me, Mr. Brown. - Has Romeo gone insane? - What nonsense? To beat his drummer, isn't it madness or what? Excuse me, please. Excuse me. So you're here. Listen, Jenny. Listen, Jenny. Today, I don't want to hear anything. You better not lecture me. I'm not lecturing you... ...but today you didn't even turn up for the rehearsals. Only eight days are left for the festival. Poor Uncle Brown will have a heart attack. How can you play with your partners' futures? I don't want to think about anybody's future. My Radha neither has a future nor a present. Do you know, that son of a gun, Resham beats my sister? Go, get me a drink. Will he stop hitting Radha if I get you a drink? Have your dinner and go to sleep. We'll talk about Radha tomorrow... ...when you're in your senses, okay? No. Sit here. We'll talk about Radha right now only. Look Romeo, Radha has dug her own grave... ...and you want to bury yourself in it? I can go to any lengths for Radha's sake, and I don't care about the result. You're sleepy, right? Go to sleep, and let me drink. - I won't let you drink any more. - I'll drink, and I'll drink for sure. If not here, then I'll go somewhere else and drink. Go to sleep. Romeo, I want to ask you something. Am I just a paying guest to you, or do I mean more than that? What do you mean? For as long as I can remember, I've been alone. There was nothing in my life. But since you met me, I had got new life. Will you give me an answer in yes or no? Ask me. Do you love me? You look so good when you laugh. - Really? - Yes. Hello.. Mr. Romeo, Hotel Sea Shell, Room 102. Resham is there and there's a girl with him as well... ...and this news has also reached to Resham's wife... ...that is, your sister, Radha. Hotel Sea Shell, Room 102. Whose call was it? Nothing.. Resham! Did you call her too? Please, come home. I don't want to get beaten by your devil brother. I apologise on his behalf. Come home, please. I knew that you'd bring your brother with you. Don't you dare. I'll call the police. Don't you dare. Will you let me live in peace? What sort of brother are you? You keep interfering between me, and my husband. Go, live your own life. Worry about your own future. Leave me, and my husband alone. Go. I don't want to see your face. Go. Now will you come home? What happened now? Nothing. - I want to go home. - What are you saying? You know that tomorrow we are going to Calcutta for the music festival. Please. Wire them that Romeo can't attend this festival. What are you saying? We've worked so hard for it. Sorry, friends.. This man has lost it, Uncle Brown. Look here, buddy. If you don't want to come then don't. Music will not die if you don't come. We'll take Jenny. That's not possible. I won't go. Romeo. You won't get a better chance than this. You've always wanted to be a star, haven't you? Once you're a star, you'll realise how lonely it is at the top. Why are you looking at me like that? I won't go without Romeo. Junita do you want that there should be injustice... ...with Romeo's bad day's partners. - Should we let their dreams be shattered? - But Uncle.. Look, don't change the topic. The people at the music festival have signed a contract with Romeo. They will sue us, and they will win also. To pay the damages Romeo will be exhaust his wealth. And he'll be on the roads once again. Save him, Love. Save him. "My lover is lost." "My love is lost." "You're in my heart, you're my life." "You're in my heart, you're my life." "My lover is lost." "My love is lost." "Till the eyes of my beloved beckon..." "...How would a love song play on my lips?" "My lover is lost." "My love is lost." "You're in my heart, you're my life." "You're in my heart, you're my life." "My pain is beyond all bounds." "My eyes are brimmed with pearls of melodies." "My love was lost at the crossroads." "Everything was lost in no time." "My lover is lost." "My love is lost." "You're in my heart, you're my life." "You're in my heart, you're my life." "My lover is lost." "My love is lost." "My lover is lost." "My love is lost." Banjo Babu, this girl will dance in my palace. Price... whatever you say. I'll pay it. Isn't she amazing? What a face! Where are you looking? It's there. Isn't that some beautiful face? She is gorgeous. You sit here my friend, I'll take a look. I'd never seen such beauty. Very beautiful! Brother what are doing? Her boyfriend is sitting here only. Forget it sir. A star doesn't keep a boyfriend. He may be a broker. Broker! - I will not leave her. - He's gone mad. Baby. The button is not opening. Why it's not opening? Boss, help me. Baby, I'll open it up. I will surely open it. Romeo. What happened? Come home, please. Autograph, please. - Dinner? - No. Why? Must I answer every question of yours? Romeo, I want your support. - I want to live with you. - No. There's no need for that. I need nobody in my life. Why do you want to be part of my morose life? I can't give you any happiness. You're a star. You have a future, and a present as well. I... I beg of you. Please get out of my life. Leave me alone with my sorrows and pain. I had come to your life to share your sorrows and pain. For me, love is forever. You are very lonely, Romeo. You need me. But I don't need you. Go away and let me live in peace. Go away. Okay. I'll leave... ...but hear me out. Once I'm gone, you won't find me even if you search till the end of the world. - Never. - Thanks a lot. Switch off the light before you leave. - Hello. - Hello, Junita. What's the matter? Radha, Romeo will drink himself to death. Radha he committing slow suicide. Listen, let me speak to Ramu. He has... I have left that house, Radha. I'm calling you from a reception counter. Help him out, Radha. The doctor said that his liver is also damaging. Radha, save him. Please. Well done, Lord. First you shove me into a pit, and then you're clicking my photographs. You're a wonderful photographer. Here, take another one. Thank you. Radha. - Are you drunk? - Yes. Why? Why not? If you're a star, I'm a star's sister. You drink because you're feeling sad for me, don't you? But the sorrow is actually mine. So, I have more right to drink. Come on, Brother. You and me cheering... ...and drinking and drinking. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Ramu. By your drinking alcohol, nothing will change. Resham is still what he has always been. The pain in my body is still as it is. I still have tears in my eyes. Ramu, if drinking is the solution to all problems... ...then I have the right to drink, don't I? Sister, I've understood. After today, neither I will drink... ...nor you will drink. Ramu I still feel there will be a change in my life. May be Resham will mend his ways. I will make Resham mend his ways, Radha. I will. Resham's child will make him mend his ways. Child? - You're pregnant? - Yes. You.. You.. Radha. Radha, if you have son... - ...we'll name him Shyam after our father. - Yes. And if it's a daughter... - ...we'll name her after our mother, Sita. - Sita. No, sister. Until my nephew is born... ...you won't pick up anything heavier than a glass of water. No. My sister. Radha, you've made me very happy today. Very happy. You've made me very happy as well... ...by giving up alcohol. - I'll leave now. - Have dinner at least. Resham must be waiting for me. Go carefully. Resham. Did nobody ever teach you the manners... ...that before you enter somebody's bedroom... ...you should knock first? Somebody's bedroom? This bedroom is mine, this house is mine. This bed is mine. These clothes that you're wearing are mine as well. Gangaram, Champa! Pick up this bed sheet and throw it out. Throw her out as well. What are you looking at? I pay you. Get rid of all this. Don't dare come forward! Come on. Get out of my bedroom. You witch. Now you have become so cheap... ...that you brought a prostitute in this house. - Look, dear. - Don't touch me, you rascal. You have looted my wealth. My brother had given me everything and you ruined that. You have spoilt my life. And now you have brought a prostitute in this house. What? No. - I'm sorry, she's had a miscarriage. - No. Her condition is not well; she had lot of bleeding. Her life is at risk. Whoever has beaten her, has done so very ruthlessly. It's time for the operation, I'm going. What's the matter? I just paid Radha a visit. The doctor told me that someone has beaten her very ruthlessly. Neither the doctor knows what ruthless means, nor do you. I've come here to teach you the meaning of ruthlessness. Now you understood the meaning of ruthlessness. I understood! Now I will explain you properly. Get up. I had told you not to hurt Radha. - I told you, right? - Yes. Then why did you hurt her? Then why did you hurt her? Inspector, arrest him. He has murdered a child who wasn't even born. He has murdered my sister's happiness. He has murdered my sister's happiness. What are you saying? Radha has given her statement just before the operation... ...that she slipped on the staircase. And if something happens to her... ...nobody would be held responsible for it. Did you hear Radha's statement, Resham? If you have any shame left in you... ...then have shame on this statement. No. Radha. Cheers. Cheers. Fantastic. Fantastic, Your Highness. Your Highness! By killing Radha you have worked wonders. Wonder! Here her ashes will be dispersed in the Ganges... ...and there, Romeo will start drinking alcohol again. Doctor has told Romeo that if he drinks even one more drop of liquor... ...he will be die. Your Highness! Fantastic! Fantastic! Your Highness! You have very beautifully removed that thorn from our side. - I hate thorns, Mr. Banjo. - Mr. Binjo! But I love flowers. Mr. Banjo I want that flower. But I couldn't understand. That beautiful flower, Junita! I want Mr. Banjo! Junita! Junita! Junita! Cheers! Cheers! Hello! Romeo! Romeo is dead! I am Junita speaking, please don't disconnect the phone. No! No! Such a big superstar has called me! How can I disconnect the call? - Tell! - Romeo, do you think... ...Radha will rest in peace by seeing you in such condition. Don't take her name! She died alone. She didn't even think that after her... ...how will her brother survive. I don't know to live without her, Junita. I don't know to live without her. You are lying. You have made Radha's death an excuse to drink. You only love yourself. - Junita! - I am telling truth! She wanted to see her brother as the world's biggest dancing star. And you are drowning yourself in alcohol. If you really loved Radha then quit drinking. And straight come to Jalpaiguri... ...where I have dedicated this show to Radha. You come here and by becoming world's biggest dancing star... ...give peace to your sister's restless soul. Till then, Radha will not accept any homage from you. "The whole world will be impressed by you." "This fervour and excitement..." - "...Should always be with you." - Are you listening? Romeo you will come, right? Romeo you will come, right? Are you listening? Romeo you will come, right? - "Your style." - Yes! - Romeo you will come, right? - I will come! - "Super-dancer.. - Is here." - "Super-dancer.. - Will dance." - "Super-dancer.. - Will sing." Uncle, Romeo is coming. Junita, do you think you've done the right thing by calling him here? You know his condition very well. Do you think he will be able to withstand the stress of such a big show? See Junita! You know very well. The people never deserted him. He left them, and went away. Today also many have pinned their hopes on him. I am afraid that to fulfill their hopes he will dance so much. Dance so much that! No Uncle! Nothing will happen to Romeo. Because this show is a homage to Radha. May I come in! Hello! Hello! Junita how are you. Hello man, how do you do? I know I am not welcome here. But Junita, I have brought one fantastic proposal for you. - Fantastic! - Tell your profit. My profit! My profit is nothing, old man. But there's someone who's a music lover. The king, the ex-king. That's why he can't sit with public. But, Junita he is your great fan. Great! He wants that you come in his palace and sing for him. And money whatever you wish you may demand. Money is no problem for the king? I mean ex-king. Tell your king if he wants to hear my song... ...then come to the Jalpaiguri show. Jalpaiguri! But.. Jenny you don't understand, he is a king. Yes! I understand! Tell your king I am a performer not a prostitute. Now please go away! - But.. - You understand, now please go. What did you say? She has refused! That's right! And after refusing me, they are coming in Jalpaiguri for programme. All these beautiful girls why they are so foolish? After knowing that Jalpaiguri's road comes in my area? Kidnap her! Who are you? What do you want? Get lost, old man. Get lost! Bring that girl out. You bastard! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Leave her! Leave her! Go from here! Go. Leave her! Run away you all! Run away or I will shoot you! Go! And tell that devil... ...until I am alive he will not be able to ruin any other girl's life. - You go from here! - Come on driver. Clear the way. - Go away from here, daughter. - Whose goons were they? The goons of the devil who rules here. We have to leave immediately. Come! Come on hurry up! Come on driver. Mother you change this sari. Okay! Romeo! Romeo! Hello Romeo! Hello! It is wonderful, the hall is filled to capacity. They're selling Rs.100 tickets for Rs.1000 outside! People are restless to see you. They have gone mad for you. Today, you have to prove that you are the greatest. All the best! Get ready soon, I will check the arrangements. I am so happy, Romeo. I am so happy. Mother! My mother! Mother! I am Ramu, Mother! - You are my son, Ramu! - Yes! Your son, Ramu! - You are Ramu! - Yes. - My son, Ramu! - Yes. No son, no! Don't touch me! That devil had dishonoured this body. It is not worthy of you touching me. That devil thinks every performer is a prostitute. Who? A.M. Singh! Today if I hadn't reached in time... ...then he would have kidnapped Junita also. What? Had he kidnapped you? - Yes son! - Why? Don't ask this? No woman can tell her young son about those atrocities. Don't ask me, son. Don't ask me. Seven minutes left to start the show, get ready soon. Ok! 'AM Singh after Radha's show...' '...I will avenge my mother's torture.' Ramu, where is my Radha? She must be married now, right? I had so many dreams for both of you. Mother, today I am going to fulfill Radha's dream. Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance! "I'll sing till dawn." - Will you sing with me? - Yes! "I'll dance till my last breath." - Will you dance with me? - Yes! That old lady saved her. Go! Kill that old lady! I will kidnap that beautiful girl. "Whenever I remember you, I sing a new song." "Your colour shades my songs." "Still your love is there in my heart." "I still listen to your prayer." "It was your wish that the whole world will bow before me." "Come and see your wish has been fulfilled." "Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!" "Dance is life!" "Life is dance!" "Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!" "Dance is life!" "Life is dance! Dance! Dance!" "My heart wants me to keep singing everywhere I go." "Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!" - "Dance is life! - Dance is life!" - "Life is dance! - Life is dance!" "My life! My whole life!" "I wish I keep on singing." "Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!" "Dance is life!" - "Life is dance! - Dance! Dance!" "After so many years I have met my life." "After so many years, the wish of my heart has been fulfilled." "Sing such a rhythm that the whole stage dances." "This heart has never got so much love before." "Sing such a song that rhythm goes on falling." "The whole world would dance with us." "Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!" "Dance is life!" "Life is dance! Dance! Dance!" "Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!" "Dance is life!" "Life is dance! Dance! Dance!" "Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!" "Dance is life!" "Life is dance!" "I will see who has the guts." "To come here and challenge me." "Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!" "Dance is life!" "Life is dance! Dance! Dance!" "I have taken a promise, your promise." "Whoever will do such crime, will not be forgiven." "Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!" "Dance is life!" "Life is dance! Dance! Dance!" "Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!" "Dance is life!" "Life is dance!" "Dance!" No! Attack! Resham! Now I will be able to say sorry to Radha. You also forgive me. Resham! You dare to refuse my proposal. Move. How dare you refuse Thakur A.M. Singh? Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Leave her, you scoundrel! Leave her. Move, you old lady. Leave me! Romeo! Leave me! Romeo! A.M. Singh! Ramu! Ramu! You scoundrel! You dare to challenge me. Yes! I want to speak to the police commissioner. Beat him son! Beat him! Break his hands. Don't spare him, son. No, Your Highness! All avenues of escape have been closed. Forgive me! Forgiveness, then ask forgiveness. Ask forgiveness from this stage. This is our temple and not a place for your enjoyment. Not every woman who performs here is a prostitute. She may be somebody's sister, maybe she is someone's mother. Recognise this woman. She is my mother! Mother! Forgive me! Forgive me! I will surely forgive you. But first return her youthful days, her self respect. Return her husband. Can you return it? No! You will never be able to return it! You have lived too long! You have lived too long! 'I'll not spare you.' 'Just like Draupadi...' '...I won't tie my hair until I wet it with your blood.' Son! Arrest him!
