I'VE GOT JUST A FEW WORDS I WANT TO SAY TO YOU TONIGHT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT, AND I'D LIKE YOU TO LISTEN BECAUSE SOME OF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE YOUR LIFE CHANGED. YOU SEE, GOD LOVES YOU, AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT, "GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHOULDN'T PERISH BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE." AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT WE HAVE ALL SINNED AND COME SHORT OF GOD'S GLORY AND THAT THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH. THAT'S THE PENALTY FOR BREAKING GOD'S LAW, AND SIN IS DISOBEDIENCE. [many people talking--country dance-band in background] (Danny) YOU PROMISED. YOU PROMISED!! I SAID I'D TRY. SMOKEY, YOU PROMISED. YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD. I PROMISED I'D HELP YOU RIDE A BULL.

SO YOU BEAT HIM AT CARDS, AND HE PROMISED TO TAKE YOU TO THE TENT NEXT DOOR AFTER THE RODEO? YUP. THAT RIGHT COWBOY? ♪ ♪ [thunder crash] ♪ ♪ (Franklin Graham) GOD LOVES YOU, AND GOD IS WILLING TO FORGIVE YOU. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE WILLING TO COME TO GOD-- HIS WAY. JESUS SAID, "I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE. NO MAN COMES UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME." JESUS IS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS PAID THE PENALTY OF SIN. AND OUTSIDE OF CHRIST, THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN STAND BEFORE GOD BECAUSE YOU HAVE SINNED. AND YOU SAY, "WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SIN?" TELLING A LIE IS A SIN. AH, SEX OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE IS A SIN. TAKING SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU IS A SIN. AND WHEN CHRIST DIED ON THAT CROSS 2000 YEARS AGO, HE TOOK YOUR SIN, AND HE TOOK MY SIN, AND HE DIED IN YOUR PLACE, AND IN MY PLACE, AND YOU SEE GOD WILL FORGIVE YOU. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'VE DONE. GOD IS WILLING TO FORGIVE YOU IF YOU'RE WILLING TO CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. GOD WILL CLEANSE YOU, AND GOD WILL PUT THE PIECES OF YOUR LIFE BACK TOGETHER. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'VE DONE. AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU THAT CHANCE TONIGHT-- IS TO FIND GOD'S PURPOSE FOR YOUR LIFE, GOD'S PLAN FOR YOUR LIFE, TO RECEIVE JESUS CHRIST BY FAITH INTO YOUR HEART, AND TO SAY, "GOD, I'VE SINNED, AND I'M SORRY. FORGIVE ME." I BELIEVE THAT YOUR SON JESUS CHRIST DIED ON THE CROSS FOR MY SINS, AND ON THE THIRD DAY, YOU RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD, AND THAT HE IS IN HEAVEN. AND I WANT TO PUT MY FAITH AND TRUST IN HIM. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT TONIGHT, I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU JUST TO GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT AND COME STAND HERE, AND THEN I'M GOING TO LEAD YOU IN A PRAYER.
