Whirlpool! We're going straight into a whirlwind. We believe that the incident has created a black hole, which has engulfed the mass tectonics. The only thing we know now is that the land... is a 99% liquid surface, therefore land still exists. They make us believe a thing impossible! If we find the black box... we know if America still exists. "There is no JFK." "We've lost contact with Quebec." "The whole of Australia is gone! Can anyone hear me?" It's the most important child in the world. And you have to take care of it. I want an abortion, Piti. It doesn't have a father? Well I will be the father. Alright. From now on, you're the father of my child. Wouldn't you like to know... Who would like to kiss you? I thought, maybe... you felt something for me. They accuse me of being insensitive, lacking in affection, suspicious, stubborn. And if suddenly there was someone... that at this time if they found out all of your flaws? We should talk about it, right? - Salome, what have I done! - What did you do? I threw myself at Ulises kissing him as if I were in a club, and had drunk six gin and tonics... I'll tell you what matters, that the one that you really like is Ainhoa, but my boy, instead of fighting, you throw in the towel and go with the easy one. it's okay as adventure, but in the end you will want stay with someone your own age. I don't want to be with Ulises. I haven't spoken of Ulises. I was in love with Salome all my life, but I went with your mother, I ran away, Tonight I'll help you move and you come live with me. It's already too late. I wanted to ask your consent... For Ainhoa to come live with me. I brought my boyfriend. I wanted to thank you. Because you took care of us on the ship. This is why you come to my bed? I'm not the spare wheel of anyone. You shit. Maybe you don't want to sleep with your boyfriend. You were in my bed. Giving me kisses and making the dead cat... I stayed five minutes. Until I realized what shit you are. You don't look at me, and don't even talk to me. For you I don't exist on this ship. "- We see an island. - There is still an island. " "Let's try to land, guys." There is land. We children lose small things. Pencils, gloves, toys... Even the grown ups lose things, but they are grown up things. Cars, houses, or pieces of land called "continents". Play it again, Ramiro. - Again? - Yes. Come on, the last, last time, please, Ramiro. "- We sighted land. - Let's see land 15 miles north-west." "Can anybody hear me? We see an island." "We're going down, we're going down." "Let's try to land." "Let's try to land, guys." My daddy has lost land, but now they are all happy because he finds it. And when you lose something and then find it, you're much happier than you were. There's land! Ramiro, Piti, You should be at the stern, no? It's your turn to go fishing. - These are days that we don't see a tuna. - Yes, sir. And the others? You have nothing to do? Come on, get back to work, fast. Hell, you already smoke, you could at least open a window a little. Thank you. Ricardo, this flight, MCSI-254, went along the route London-Buenos Aires, so far so good. But when he addressed communication, he could be anywhere within these three coordinates, okay? What do you mean? Well, that came out of his path. He circles to look for land. The area he may have traveled, is about 32 thousand square kilometers south of the Azores. Under optimal conditions, to cover that area may take four years. - Maybe five. - It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. That will be a great blow for the crew. No. It won't be a blow because we won't tell them. After so long, they finally have a reason to get up in the morning. El Barco - 1x08 - Fishing mayor - Translation and synch: Alle83, johanna.p, ziomele, nina_bach Revision: Allison Ah, what the hell. Can you...? On land it will be hard to pretend to meet by chance. When we're on land, the first thing I'll do is lose sight of you forever. Snitch. I hope you're happy and everything is fine, to live with Gamboa. GREAT FISHING Ainhoa! Take care of yourself, okay? Fuck, four days without catching anything. At this rate, we'll become the figures worthy of Plaza de los Cibeles. Hey, what are the three things you'll do when we're on the island? How should I know? I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. Well, I do, I do. You will do the first girl you see. That's right, Ramiro. And then I'll do the second girl I see. And then, when I'll have calmed down, I do the third girl that I find. Well, like on the ship. Ramiro, take the bait, take the bait. Let's see. - Nothing, no? - It must have been a current, I don't know. Sometimes, with biscuits for breakfast, I get my commission, because those that are braking or broken I eat them myself. This is stealing. - I wouldn't call it stealing. - Well, not you, but the Holy... And the cloth? I should pass it every day, as I do for 15 years, but at the end of the world, someday yes and someday no. - Salome. - Yes? When you wanted to confess, I don't think it was for biscuits or clothes. You wanna tell me what's really bothering you? A sense of guilt. Because lately I've been... Salome. I'm sorry. I return later. Ainhoa? Come on. What, have you got there? I wanted to give it to you for your birthday, but... this is more important. Thank you. You shouldn't have, thank you very much. What's this? I was not there when you graduate, or when you become a woman. Dad, come on. I have a feeling that this is the first important moment of your life where there are too. - Dad, I'm in the cabin in front. - Yes, but... this is the closest thing to leaving home, honey. Given the situation, it's as if you got married. Do you want to try it on or what? Sure. I think it's my size. Don't you like it? No. I'm sorry. I chose it with your sister, but we are not very fashion savvy. However, I have the receipt if you want to change it. But to me These sleeves bloom like a lot. I was told that it was fashionable this year, apparently it isn't. Now it's your turn. What are the three things you will do when you will touch land? I will run in a straight line until I faint. A cripple can run in a straight line? And the second? I'll have a bath in the sea. - Good one, Ramiro. - No, really. I will take a bath looking at the sand of the beach, knowing that I can go back on the mainland when I want. Actually, it doesn't sound bad at all. And the third? What's the third thing you'll do when you're on land? Feel the lack of Pilar. I stole a biscuit for you. Salome says that stealing biscuits is wrong, but... she does the same when she thinks I haven't seen her. I'm not hungry. Are you sad? - A little. - But why? The entire crew is happy because there is land. - Aren't you? - I will miss everyone. - Why? - Because when we're on land, they will all go their own way and we won't see them anymore. Like when you change schools, or end the summer holidays. Yes, but maybe we'll find land, as small as a football field. Or basketball court. If the land is small as a basketball court, we will see them for sure. Piti! Piti! Piti! Shit! What the fuck was that? The trip on the North Star includes breakfast, miss. Even if you accept tips. You have prepared me breakfast! Peaches in fresh seaweed. Chew the seaweed good otherwise it will stick to your palate. There is also a mini slice of toast, a biscuit integral jam, butter, half a cup of milk because the other half spilled in the hallway. And a flower for the sexiest woman on the ship. I had never been brought breakfast in bed. Well... Technically, this is a cot, not a bed. No, it's a bed. - A mini-bed. - No. And there is room for... both of us. When we're on land, I promise I'll make you a bed with palm leaves and as a breakfast I will bring you a coconut. Come live with me. Move into my cabin. Julia, I... I don't think it's a good idea. Wounded man! Wounded man! Wounded man! - Turn around, let's see how you are. - It's amazing. Nice. If your mother saw you... - Nice. - You're amazing, Salome. Practice. I like necklines and mending my clothes. Well, in any case I have to adjust a little here. Give me a pin. We don't have pins. Be right back. Don't I look like a cabbage anyway? No, you're beautiful. Now with whom can I gossip until 2 in the morning? I'm not dead yet. I'm going just on the opposite side of the cabin. - Yes, but its not the same. - I'll be your neighbor. Yes. Don't be silly. Ainhoa, we're friends, right? Yes, no? Yes. I have to tell you something. It's that I don't like Gamboa at all. Already. Why would you say that now? Because we're friends... and I think friends must say the truth. And I prefer to tell you now before it's too late. Look, what do you know about him? You don't know anything. Yes, he has grown up in Las Barranquillas, but nothing else. - Just this. Nothing more. - Well, if you think I know him so little, - You know him even less, right? - It doesn't matter how much I know. But, I think I know enough to know that going to live in his cabin as well, - Is bullshit. - Well, look, really, I don't want to continue to talk about it, enough. I just tell you to wait, Ainhoa, to think about it, Relax. You're justifying, you haven't even said that it's because you are in love with him. It's true. What do you gain by rushing? - Rushing? - Yes. Strange you tell me this when its you, you're the one who goes out to dinner at ten o'clock, eleven starts drinking, midnight knows a guy and at one o'clock in the club is already pregnant. - Have you finished speaking with Palomares? - Yes. What were you talking about, if you don't mind? Of this and that, nonsense. Salome. In the relationships that I had throughout my life, there have been few, I always lied. like a coward. With you, I promised myself that would be different. That I would never lie. You think I'm lying? We talked about it between us there would be no secrets, and now I have the feeling... you're hiding something from me. It's a way to lie too. De la Cuadra, you must come at once to the bridge. I go with the pepper in the ass. You got me, I'm hiding something. I was confessing. Try to relax. You're lucky. It could have came down to the bone. A second more and you would loose a hand. What species of fish could it have been, Julia? I have it. It's passing under the ship. So draw four lines at one time, it has the strength... of a white whale. Record that echo. Registered, in four dimensions. The white whale does not take the bait. Ever. However it is not a whale, but it has the same dimensions. 34 meters. What? - That must be wrong? - No. The calculations are correct. But the image of the sonar is not clear. It could be a false echo. Or a beast as big as this ship. Ramiro... I wanted to congratulate you... the work you've done with the aircraft black box. You have found land. Incredible. Are you an engineer by any chance? I studied telecommunications. For that they gave me a scholarship. Well, thank you. Until yesterday, I thought that this ship would have been my grave. Congratulations. Thank you. Although... it is a pity that the captain... instead of treating you as the hero for giving hope to this ship, He treats you like an idiot, don't you think? The underwater camera will tell what kind of fish is down there. Yes, if we can lure him. Burbuja, throw down all that bait. It's already in the ship, no need to waste it yet. okay. How do you know it's there? Because it's been four days that I fished nothing. Why leave now? League of fish buoys mooring, Burbuja. Julia, maybe I was a bit abrupt when I said... - That perhaps there is no need of living together. - No, no, no... - I don't... - No, no, it's not a good idea, really, I swear, we have only been together... two days and I ask you already to live together. Normal people go first to the park, to the movies,... to skate... I don't know. For the park and the cinema I see it hard. - Yeah. - Instead, skating in winter, indoors, if you want... we build skates... and skate. You know what we could do? What? I think the best thing is to do one thing at a time. and... I don't know, when you want Come to my cabin and... - And that's it. - Okay. First, a chat, as the second thing we have sex... And the third? - There's a third? - No. No, I... what I want to tell you is that... You can also call me to do things that aren't from the couple. As friends and that's it. I don't know, smoke a cigarette on the deck, - And chat... - Son... the walkie, we're listening. Come on, let's go. Go. Keep it! Come on. I know it's there. Beware of the monitor, submerge the camera. The captain lies. There is land, but to explore the route of that plane could take five years. Maybe ten. Come down to three meters. All right. Rotate 90 degrees, slowly. Rotating 90 degrees. Why would he hide this? For the same reason he has hidden this. - Come down to five meters. - Got it. A high-frequency transmitter. If there is anyone out there, only with this device we could communicate with them. The question is: do you know how it works? - Did you see that? - No, I don't see anything. Exactly, there's nothing. There are always fish in the sea. I will not use any device without the permission of the captain. It's a shame that you are loyal to the people who have destroyed this world. And who killed your girlfriend. Do you remember when we lined up in Panama, Chile, and four whales we had chased for 300 miles? Because they thought we were a pack. Five meters. And? Perhaps it has confused the ship and thinks we're its mom. If that animal is a baby, God help us when we see the mother. You can choose whether to stay in the team of rabbits or in mine. But I will not accept more lies. You choose. Do you see something? No, we don't see anything. Rotate 180 degrees. level Rotate There! De la Quadra, go back. Back. Come on. Back. It disappeared, it's no longer there. What's up? We lost the signal, has something happened? It's large. I don't believe it Piti, what are you doing? Estela, I swear that if it wasn't an emergency, I wouldn't enter without knocking. Look at my hands. No one wants to help me and I need to pee. Estela... don't be difficult now. In fact... you already know the terrain. Out. - Estela, just a moment... - Out, go on. - Please. - Out, Piti, out. Vilma... I don't know, I may have overdone it a bit first. No, you haven't gone too far. In fact, you were right. Yes, things are very fast. That's the way. But not only with relationships, also with friends. One day I get on a boat and the day after I think I have a friend for life. And the next day I understand that it's not so, because it's offensive when you tell the truth. Vilma... Vilma. Ainhoa! Ainhoa! Well, see you later. Father... listen... I don't like priests, neither on earthmuch less at sea. They bring bad luck. So if you don't want to have problems, tell me now why my girlfriend came to confess to you. She confesses with me because I am the only priest who is here. She needed to talk to someone. Do not give me one of your sermons. For me it's the same whether you are a priest or an acrobat. I want you to tell me what you talked about with Salome, now. - If you care so much, ask her. - I do not fuck up. Let's see... I'm asking you nicely. tell me what you talked about with Salome, or I'll grind away until Christmas. Don't you realize that? You're asking me to violate the sacrament and the seal of the confessional. Let's see if you realize, I'm not asking, I'm ordering you as first mate of the North star. Your job as a first mate is to steer the ship. Mine is to keep the secrets of the crew. You do your job and let me do mine. Okay? You want to do your job? Very well, you will. Because in this ship as well as a priest, you are also a hub. And you know what a hub does? They clean the toilets. So come on, move. Didn't you hear? Come on. Hop-hop, come on. Palomares, you have to help me before cleaning the toilets. - What? What do you want? - Look at me. Look at me. - That's a joke. - Come on, father... a bit of Christian charity, please. I've been trying for two hours. With the gloves I can't. Please. Come on, come on. Straight to the purpose. - Let's see. - Without fear, do not hesitate. But hold this just, eh? Not used to it, maybe you like and you want more. What are you doing? What are you doing? Fuck off. Father, I was joking, Palomares! Palomares! This is the image that the camera has taken before being destroyed. One eye of 13 cm in diameter. Whatever it is, this beast is eating our fish. Either we kill it, or we all die. We calculated the size in proportion to the eyeball, what we assume is that it is between 30 and 36 meters. There is not one sea creature that exceeds 30 meters and it is not a blue whale. - That's absolutely impossible. - Impossible? We are here. What is the percentage of the seabed marine scientists explored? - Not even 5%, lady! - Dad... Is it possible that there are species whether or not we do not know? Not of this size without having been sighted before. Tell that to those who have fished the giant squid of 20 meters in Mexico. - Dad! - He was holed up somewhere? This too then. It will be a change, I know. For a mutation it takes from two to four million years, sir. You have no idea what you're saying. - And you do? - Yes. You think more to ensnare my son then that animal below us. - Will you shut up, Dad? - No. - You're exaggerating! - Julian, come here. Can you tell what's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? Is that I have had it... for doctors, priests and all the people of the universe, man! - That's it. - What? What? Salome... goes around to confess to the priest. And with whom should she confess to? With the helmsman? Come on Julian you as well as Salome, have your son and me, but she... first spent all day on the phone with Marisa talking about her things, - But now she has none, understand. - But I'm here. I'm here. If she has something to confess, say so to me, fuck. And not a priest for two pennies. With this we can kill the monster. It was a present from an officer in the merchant navy. Where are you going with this, son? It's a museum piece. It's a harpoon for whales. And if it works with the whales, then should also work with the monster. Has the right length to shoot crushing in the eye and the brain. - It's mine. - You want to use it by shooting from the deck? No. If we want to use it, one of us has to go down there. Captain... - Damn. - Sorry, sorry, Salome. Be a little more careful. - Sorry. - Good thing it's plastic. On gimme, that, give me. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, he says. Ramiro, my friend, my companion, hell, my brother! You'll certainly help me Today is a great day for everyone... because we now know that there is a place towards which directs us. An island out there somewhere. But it is also a very important day for me... because the most beautiful girl of the North Star... will come to live in my cabin. Ainhoa... I could survive without land, but not... without seeing your smile when we wake up. Anyone wishing to send... Christmas greetings to my girlfriend, you mark the new address. Ainhoa Montero, cabin number 9, school ship North Star Earth. I do not think the fish will hurt you. You suggest to go into apnea, Burbuja? You never know. For Miss Julia it has been sad? And who says she's sad? Her eyes. Yesterday they did not say so, today they do. They are sad... like the fish in the picture. Even that eye is sad. It seems that someone is missing. Like Julia. You're her boyfriend, right? Yes Burbuja, I'm her boyfriend. Is there something you need to tell me? Listen, we can talk about whatever you want. Is there anything you wanna talk about? Since you're her boyfriend you should make her smile... or say sweet things over the intercom, like Gamboa. But you stay here to build cages. It's him. It's not a dolphin or killer whale, nor a sperm whale... no moans as well. So sad. Let's see. Can I help you? No, I was just... doesn't matter, I was leaving. First mate, sorry. I know that you and I have started one the wrong foot, with the gum stuff and... but since by now we have rounded corners... I would like to ask you a favor. Could you help me... pull out the periscope... to urinate? If I help you pull out the periscope... you would not have to urinate... but chop and feeding the fish. I help you? captain, I apologize for what happened with De La Cuadra before. Lately I'm a little tense. Don't worry, we are all a little. If you want to talk about something... So I couldn't help but to hear Ulises with the walkie. Want to talk about it? No. Actually... yes. I'm in love with Ulises. I'm in love... and... I think I scared him. I understand that. If you were to ask me to come and live with you... I would stay paralyzed, sitting on a chair... but happy. If I had the same age as the boy, I mean. He's young. Just give him time. This ship needs people in love. Julia, he'd have to be quite mad for not wanting to live with you... at 20. Thank you. Dad, you're stupid. I mean, you like Julia and you give her advice. - I mean... - she's committed now, okay? She asked Ulises to move in with her. He is not sure, but she did. What did he say? Did he say if he will move in with her or... I don't know. I really don't know what he said or what he didn't say. I don't know. I think that, yes, he said he was not sure. What does it matter what he said. You are sure instead? You sure you're in love with Julia? Absolutely cooked. It's stupid but... I'm fully cooked. But she decided. So the question is closed. Aguilar, check to what extent is Garmendia with the cage. Maybe we can do the dive before it gets dark. Roger that, captain. - It's the dress that I gave you, right? - Ulises will dive in a cage? It's back out here. We're talking about. What the hell is this stuff? 30 years on a ship and it is the first time I feel such a thing. I'm no expert, but fuck if it's weird. - You know what's really weird? - Push a little. That if you really are in love with doctor... you don't have the balls to live together. And how are you in here defending the doctor? I would like to remind you that yesterday... you called her a bitch and a little while ago you made a scene with bells and whistles, Dad. Listen son... - The doctor is not in my good graces. - I noticed. But it's your life, not mine. - So it is my... - If you have to do foul. Do it. Do not stand there and waste time, as I did with your mother. Be happy or get the one you want. As soon as possible. But bet on something. I bet on Salome, and I will stay with her until death. Even if you have to steal, do damage, whatever it takes... but do not lose her for the world. It took me 43 years to learn that lesson. 43 years to stop being an asshole. You're not an asshole, First Officer. You're my friend. This screw does not want to go in. I hope you don't have the same aims for everything. Give me a hand, fuck. Defined coordinates and the possible routes of the aircraft. I must again lie to the crew to keep alive hope and confidence. De la Cuadra is estimated that it will take 5 or 6 years to find the island. He's wrong. Navigating sailing depend on the weather. It will take no less than 10 years. I did not tell him. I lied. I have the feeling of not having done more than lie since they are on the ship. Why did you steal it? I didn't steal anything. I saw you leave the captain's cabin. - It's the logbook, right? - It's none of your business. Ramiro, we're friends. What's gotten into you? For your sake, get out of the cabin and forget what you saw. Out. Okay, okay. - I leave the cabin and forget what I saw. - Great. But I'll tell the captain that you have entered his cabin to steal the logbook. You do not say anything to anyone. Okay? Palomares. I came to see you because I thought... It wouldn't hurt to chat. A confession, as it's called. After so many years on the high seas, happens that one is forgetting God. you understand. Officer, I don't know what you want... - But if that... - I confess, as I said, Father. In short, you have confessed my woman, you can confess me too, right? You don't want to confess. You just want to know what Salome said to me in confession. Absolutely not. It's water under the bridge. I came to confess... because I stole, Father. I stole a small object. But it has a large value for a person on the ship. Then return it. It's a book. Very little, as I said. Hardcover, golden pages. Written in society from those guys, what are they called? Oh right. The apostles. Yes. A incunabulum, which is certainly the only example that exists in the world. - You stole my Bible from the cabin? - I'm afraid so, Father. So you just playacting and shit. Tell me what you talked about with Salome... or you can say goodbye to your spiritual guide. I'll wait in the dining room, you have 15 minutes. Got it? Or the Bible ends up in the sea. and God help you. So I know what we can do to not separate once on land. We can afford to live on the ship... with the captain and first officer. They'll give orders all the time. But if everyone gets off the ship... Who will they give the orders too? Maybe we can go ashore every now and then. Sure we can. On land we can play hiding treasures in the sand. - Climb the trees. - Make a hut. And make friends. - In the end it's nice that there is land. - Well, yes. But we have to take an oath. An.. an oath to never stop being friends, and not to miss eachother. I don't want to miss you. Missing is sad. So I swear I never stop being your friend. - I swear, too. - High five. Socket. I have taken you. And now you launch. Here there is everything. All the information that the captain has hidden. The crash, the bomb, the estimated time to find land. Everything is a lie. They treat us like idiots. If Gamboa had not taken us in the mutiny... we wouldn't even know that the world is no more. You've never hidden anything from anybody to not hurt them? Nothing of this magnitude. No. Want to know why they hide it? Because they are up to their necks. I don't need you to tell the captain what I did. I will. What are you trying to prove diving with this circus cage? Snitch, You're putting your nose where you shouldn't. You are afraid to move in with your girlfriend... but, it doesn't scare you to dive in a cage and face a huge sea monster. And you? It's all day long you carry around a suitcase like a lost soul... because you're afraid to live with Gamboa. I'm not afraid. - Oh, no? - No. Then go. You have also taken off that ridiculous dress wedding, or night, or whatever it is. I still have three hours to finish welding the cage. Let me do it, please. May I ask what you are doing? I'll help you kill yourself. Burbuja. Can you help me pee? How can I help you pee? Could you hold me while I pee? Please. Do you know what a particle accelerator is? First Officer. One moment, father. I'm taken by the resurrection of Lazarus, it's addictive. Amen. Time. Give me back the Bible. Tell me what Salome told you when she confessed. No. Very well. So say goodbye to the scriptures, Father. You know what first officer? Something has changed in the world of the priesthood. Now we priests are sons of bitches. San Antonio de Cuba Vitola purple. The last 20 cigars of his escort. And, probably, the last 20 cigars in the world. boy, I warn you that you are risking big. Give me the box or I'll skin you alive. Cigars for the bible. If you throw the box... You will clean toilets until you have white hair between your legs. At least I'll do it in a space free from smoke. Cigars for the bible. On three. One... two... three. You want me to leave you alone, right? Just tell me this. Tell me if she said... She wants to leave me. officer, I'm sorry, but I made a vow. I can not reveal what she told me and what not. But if you want to know what we talked about ask her. So even things frozen expire? Yes, Burbuja, of course, even those expire. Captain. What are you doing? and... are you sad? A little bit, right? Because your baby is gone. No, Ainhoa isn't gone. She's just changing rooms. But I think so... this saddens me a little. So... fathers become... sad when children move? A little bit, Burbuja. Happy because they succeed them good things, but sad because they leave. But if she goes into the room in front of you. Yes, Burbuja, but even if you are twelve meters away, She has started to leave, and there is no remedy. For this I am sad. Like all fathers, Burbuja. I understand, fathers are missing and to miss is sad. That's it. Now you have your cage. I hope you fall, that the fish eats you - And I don't see you ever again. - Afterwards, however, don't cry at the funeral. - Listen, can I ask you a few things? - Yes. Can you ask Gamboa to do me a pep talk over the intercom? And come with this dress to the funeral. not going to give me a goodbye kiss? It's rubbing against us. - What's that? - It's the propeller. The fish is hitting the propeller. We are sailing, but the propeller powers the generators. No light, no radio, no freezer, no water system. De La Cuadra. We need to get it off. If you see something strange, if the animal goes crazy and goes on the cage, you pull up. - Yes! - Good. Ms. ... Why do you have to go? I am the only member of the North Star able to do so. You know that, Julia. If you really feel something for me, please don't go. What is this, a... a kind of proof of love? If you want to call it that, well... yes. You want a proof of love? Then empty two drawers of the cabinet, illegal immigrants travel with us a few things. If the proposal is still valid to share the cabin, and bed by eighty centimeters. Why do you insist on lying to us? You lied to us about the plane, the transmitter, the end of the world, and now you lie about time that we will use to find the island. If you were in my position, you would know that, sometimes, you have to lie to keep hope alive. I'd tell you the truth, hope to survive I'll find somewhere. I don't believe you anymore, because you are no longer my captain. That's nice, my God. Vilma, in this ship, many people do not understand that's what friends are for to help and to lean on in difficult times, yes you though. Yes, thank you very much, really. - Vilma, Vilma, I'm not done. - You miss it so much? The last droplets. Shake, shake a little. Okay, okay, not so much, not so much. Well, well. Zip, close well. Yes, yes, zip. Piti... if anyone finds out, - I'll kill you. - Vilma, I swear I will not tell anyone. I pee two to five times a day and I don't know when I raised the bandages. So... Look, Vilma, Vilma. Here... even if you talk about the other thing, is not it? It must be taut. - Locked. - Pull strong. Tense. - Tira. - All right, all right. Okay, let it fall. - Good. - Stop, stop, stop. Perfect, Block it here, all right. Are you okay? Yes. Concerned about Ulises. Yeah. And Salome, right? - Again with the bullshit of confession? - I saw her again. as she spoke or what it is, with Palomares. And what? I think I'm lose her, Ricardo. You're not losing anyone! Salome loves you. Salome has doubts. Otherwise, why go to confession? She 's the first thing I truly have important in life, and I lose her. - I know she wants to leave me. - I don't know. Julian, you have to stop. Talk to her. I bet the post of captain that she will not leave you. Julian? Julian, can you hear me? Yes, I hear you. Tell me. I'm at the club. Can you come a moment to talk? Don't... Don't worry. I... I return to that. Maybe it will take me a couple of weeks, but... I'll be fine, really. Surely we can be friends and everything. Do you really think that it has crossed my mind to leave you? That's not it? Want to know why I went to confess to Palomares? Because I felt guilty for being so happy. For this I went to confession. And you know what she told me Palomares? I should not feel guilty for being so happy. Because it is not my fault. And who's is it? Yours. Only you... are guilty of my happiness, that turns the ship as a teenager, without worrying about the disaster that surrounds us. Really? Really, really. - One thing. - What? Explain as the story... that if I leave you in two weeks... you are comfortable? No, I said because it does not... I mean, I'd die. Salome, seriously, I said it because you were not wrong, because I know I like... - You're an idiot. - So are you. Yes, yes. Go. I'll give you the green light. Shit, it's sinking. You did not have it locked? - It was locked. I swear. - We lost it. Why the fuck did you let the cage go? - Why the fuck did you let the cage go? - Because I can not stand to watch how much you're stupid and selfish, and how you add to your game life. Knowing that you have someone, like Julia, who needs you, and would do anything for you. You sure you did it for this? - Or you're the one who does not want to come down? - Yes. I'd rather you fall defenseless, so the beast eats you as well I will not see you again. Where are you going with that? Damn it! The cage is more than fifty yards in depth. No one can... But... Don't, don't do it, Captain! No, she does not want to hurt us. She just wants her son. Burbuja! His mother is looking for him. This is so sad. Because it was asking to give her back her baby. Ricardo. Ricardo! Ricardo... it's moving away. With... with her son. She leaves with... with her son. 153 meters. 203 meters. If you like Gamboa, I like Gamboa. In short, it is not so important to know someone, right? Well, this morning, don't think as well. What I did this... I met him in twelve years. I did not realize how stupid it was until I went to bed. I do not seem more than well hasty? No. Come here, come on. - Friends? - Well, for interest, okay? Soon I will need a babysitter to go partying and looking for men. Count on it. I'll get it. I was not referring to the suitcase. Shall we? 368 meters. 391. It's just out of reach of sonar. Ricardo, it's over and gone! Ricardo! What is it? Another beast? No, this is not a fish. I want to be the winners. Welcome to the team. It's a ship. Here at North Star Kore-Kore. Can anybody hear me? The ship appears to be in good condition and seems to be inhabited. We have to go with caution. They can be sick, dead or in the process of decomposition. Something about this ship does not convince me. Is not far from me. Love is born little by little, step by step. I do not think you care anything about Ainhoa. Love is born suddenly and I'm in this. - You do not know where you are. - Are you leaving me? - Leave the case Burbuja! - You're a liar! - I can use the transmitter. - Not a word of this to the captain. Why don't you tell her that you love her? In this ship we can no longer trust anything or anyone. - Oh, Burbuja. - We have to take it away, he's choking! Roberto! It is Burbuja... I think he's starting to remember.
