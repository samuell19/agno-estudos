[water flowing] [dramatic music playing] [gunshot from a distance] [dramatic music playing] [gunshots] The 308 is a big game hunting cartridge. Shooting at a moving target will be more difficult than hitting a stationary target. Winds are coming in from the Northwest. In a 10-mile an hour wind, that 308 will drift roughly 100 inches at that range. [rifle cocks] Control your breathing, slow it down, and hold. [panting] Now, pull the trigger. [gunshot] Fifteen inches low and to the right. [gunshot] [grunts] I'm proud of you, TJ. [man panting] Don't let him suffer, son. You have to put him out of his misery. [panting] [gunshots] [dramatic music playing] [birds chirping] [dramatic music playing] Beautiful, isn't it? It's peaceful. So is our town, Mr. Harper. Like I said on the phone, we may be small, but we're open for business. My company has active projects all across the Midwest, in Kansas to North Dakota. We just completed the Bel Air waterfront development project in Duluth. I've talked to the right people at the state level. Good. What troubles me, Mr. Harper, is the fact that this great country of ours elected a president that's letting the world flood our market with foreign buyers. With all due respect, we're an American company. We've got over a dozen development projects underway right now. And we pride ourselves in sustainable infrastructure. It's the American way. My office will forward you the zoning applications by Wednesday of next week. In the meantime, I'll make sure the right people get paid and the wrong ones get out of your way. And the planning committee? Councilors? Council is already on our side, same goes for the deputy mayor. Economy is in the ship. That's the good news. The bad news is that it's an election. It's not me you have to win over, Mr. Harper. It's the people of Crawford County. It's the American way. Now, this area of farmland here is a small parcel of land to the far side of Big Timber Creek. As I mentioned, this proposed development project is one of the largest of its kind. It represents a total investment in your community of over $150 million. So in closing, I'd like to add that my company's number one priority is the environment. This will be the lasting legacy that we will leave for those who call Crawford County their home. We project phase three to be completed at the end of 1999, just under a year from now. And when we do, we will have created hundreds of new jobs right here in this community. Yeah, for who? Your own company? We don't want to lose any more of our farms. This town has a lot of land that can be used far more efficiently. And I want to say to you that in no way will we compromise the environment in doing so. [crowd chattering] This town has a lot of land that can be used far more efficiently. You should be ashamed of yourselves for listening [inaudible]. [car door opens] [car door closes] Transform your getaway to a health and wellness retreat at our lakeside spa. Where are my sunglasses? We were supposed to be in Eagle Bay an hour ago. So we're already late. What's a few more minutes? How did it go? Like I figured. At least the mayor's on our side. But I tell you, this small hick town, they're looking at a gift horse in the mouth, if you ask me. What's this? What's it look like? It looks like a gift. Well, open it. It's a compass. Something to help you find your way out there in the world and to find your way back to me. How did I ever get mixed up with you? Your wife introduced us. Remember? [keys clanging] [engine starts] [car revving] Are you trying to kill us? It's a brand new Trans Am, 325 ponies, 5.7 liters of American muscle. Heading in the wrong direction of a one-way street. I can't wait to get away with you to see that. Yeah. I'm looking forward to a couple of days alone. No work, no bureaucrats, no phones. And no wife. Don't start with that, Brooke. I thought we moved past this? You did. You're really good at getting past it. [phone ringing] Yeah. Yeah. Buckle up. Spinning around town in his automobile. He decide something for something to steal. You better buckle up. You better buckle up. Tell the union they can kiss my ass. Why don't you get the gas? Yeah. [car door opens] No. No. [car door closes] I don't care what the [inaudible] report says. We've got 20 dump trucks full of slate, and they're all backed up. Yeah. Well, you tell Grier I want a face-to-face by Friday. [truck engine sound] That's right. [music playing] I'm a hard man, more angles than curves. You mess with me, you get what you deserve. Mister, don't cross that line. With blue jays and backwood roots. You don't want to get with me. I'll be back in the office on Monday. I'll deal with Foster. [grunts] Good morning, Sheriff. Good morning, Russ. Going fishing today? If you catch something. [car engine starts] Everything OK? Fine. What happened to all that talk about no phone, no business? No, I said, no bureaucrats. That's what I say until the day I die. [birds chirping] If we're heading North to Eagle Bay, shouldn't we've just stayed on the highway? Come on and miss all those beautiful countryside? Yeah, but that should be us here. Why didn't we just stayed on the highway? The interstate will be a parking lot. This will be faster. [trunk revving] [dramatic music playing] Those assholes from the gas station. [siren] Good, a cop. New York plates. You two lost? You didn't see that? See what? The pickup truck. They nearly killed us. They run us off the road. I guess you didn't see me. You shot past me up on 48. Yeah. Well, I haven't seen a posted speed limit in the last few miles around here. Can I see your driver's license? [glove box opens] Get out of the car. What's this about? I don't know what you do in New York. But out here, when the Sheriff asked you to get out of the car, you get the fuck out of the car. Get out. [car door opens] You too, princess. Let's go. [car door closes] Keep your hands where I can see them. Stay over there. I'm going to search your car. What are we going to do? [car door opens] [car door closes] Well, lookie what we have here? A concealed weapon. What are you carrying this for? Protection. Protection from what? Paperworks are in the glove box. It's completely legal. Not in my County, it's not. There, that's the truck. [ominous music playing] [truck engine stops] [truck door creaking] Jesus Christ. Is this town all crazy? Calm down. Calm down? These rednecks nearly killed us. You want me to calm down? [ominous music playing] This is crazy. I want to speak to your superiors. Open your mouth one more time, I'm going to shoot you in the head. [chuckles] We look like criminals to you? I don't know what criminals look like. How about you fellas? They look lost to me. What the hell is going on here? [sniffs] Raymond Harper, New York. What do you do for a living, big shot? Construction. What do you build? We haven't done anything. Rick, take the Trans Am and park it up back at the Marina. We'll meet you there. [dramatic music playing] Thanks for the short notice. I wasn't expecting you until later. Just make sure she's all gassed up. Hey. Is this even legal? [car door closes] [bag thuds] It's a short walk to the boat. [ominous music playing] Holy fuck. You still got this old tin can? It maybe old, but she's still mine. Does this thing even going to get us out there? She'll get us there. All right. You two, let's go. Move it. Oh, hot blooded. Just how I like them. [motor boat engine starts] You're feeling all right? That's how she's supposed to feel. She doesn't like the water. [ominous music playing] Why are we heading East? The island's North. The lake's choppy. We're going around it. You don't have the same last name. What? You don't have the same last name as her. [laughs] Oh, your wife doesn't know. You've been a bad boy, Raymond. [laughs] [dramatic music playing] [motor boat engine stops] Let's go. Move, let's go. You can keep whatever is in the bag. Take Gary's patrol car around back, get it inside. Same goes for my truck. Trans Am, take it to Chuck's directly, get rid of it. You can keep anything that's inside. All right. Got it? Yeah. I got it. [motor boat engine starts] [motor boat engine starts] I've been coming here since I was a kid. My dad built this place with his own hands. Just like owning your own slice of heaven. You can't beat it. What's this? An extremely expensive watch. Come on, let us go. And the watch, the car, I'd say it's a pretty good deal. Let you go, just like that? It doesn't even have any numbers on it. How am I supposed to tell the time? I think I'll keep my own. It was a gift from my wife. I can get you 50,000 by tomorrow night. Wow. That's an awful lot of money for a construction worker. I'm a land developer. And is that what this is about? Kidnapping? What will it take? 100,000? [bag thuds] [gun thuds] Are you going to tell us what you want? Just keep your mouth shut. [handcuff thuds] You, sit down. [ominous music playing] You will behave yourselves. If you don't, we're not going to be nice anymore. And we're going to hurt you real bad. [shouts] Sit your ass back down in that chair. [sheriff shouts] That's some woman you got there, Raymond. [grunts] Strong. Nearly put it through the table. You better not hurt her. Or what? What are you going to do next? Rape me? We're hunters not animals. And married, sweetheart. Not that that means anything to you. There is no escape. You'll know why you're here tomorrow. [thunder] [door opens] [brooke pants] [gunshots] Cuff yourself. Stop sandbagging it, honey. Hurry up. [breathes shakily] [door closes] [thunder] [lighter thuds] How's the arm? How do you think? She put a fucking knife through it. Could have been worse. I'm in. You guys hear about the mine in Jackson closing? Chappie, he was a foreman up there, wasn't he? That's right. Gone. They retired him. That's two to you, TJ. [chips clink] I'm in. That's not what happened. What'd you hear? It's not what I heard. It's what I know. He spent his whole life down in that mine. You guys should know better than anyone, under ground for that long. Is this something to do with your job? Development projects up in this area? It has to be. I've made enemies over the years, but not that want to kill me. Why do you carry a gun? I don't carry it. I keep it in the car for protection. It's a last resort. I'd say this is a last resort. Why didn't you use it earlier? On a cop? And what the hell is a uniformed cop doing involved in this? They want money. Just give it to them. I handed him a gold watch. He threw it away like it was nothing. No. If this is about money, they would have said so. Ransom. Maybe they're going to ransom you like a kidnapping plot. Who would bring us here? This place-- look at this place. It's got no power, no phone, nothing. I'm scared. I am so scared. [cries] Two. Housing costs are going up. All the city folk are moving this way. I check. [sighs] It's no sweat off your balls, Gary. You landed yourself a government job. I left Detroit for a reason, not to work my ass off swimming in all that human garbage. It's a fucking war zone. It always has been. Back when I was at the 5th precinct, there was a murder a night. Sometimes I just pray for it. Raise three. Pray for what? Society to fall apart. I mean, really fall apart. No cops, no law. Maybe we need a reset. Personally, I thought the Russkies would have invaded by now. What do you think, Gary? About what? Moving further North. You got rocks in your head? Any further North would be in the lake. I ain't going anywhere. I'll die here. [thunder] Up to 10 bucks to you, Rick. Interesting. I raise 30 bucks. If I catch you cheating one more time, Rick, I'm going to shove this deck up your fucking ass. [laughs] [chips rattling] [exhales deeply] We're drifting North of the Marina. I'd say two or three miles. How do you know that? Average speed of a boat is about 30 minutes per mile, maybe more. [inhales, exhales deeply] We took just over an hour and a half to get here. So-- How are we going to get out of here? We do what they say. That seems to be working real good so far. If we don't think of something, we're in trouble. What do you want us to do? Our car is probably sitting at the bottom of the lake by now. They have all the guns. We don't know where we are. There's no radio or telephone that we know of. One of them is a cop. And then there's you. What about me? Everyone knows you're here. [door creaking] What are you doing? Hey. Get up. [pants] Hey. [grunts] Ray. [door creaking, closes] [pants] [thunder] Please, we haven't done anything. [bottle thuds] Does this have something to do with Ray's work? My family has no money. I don't deserve to be here. If you're going to tell me your whole life story, why don't you sit down. [thunder] [gun cocks] I insist. Why are we here? What the hell is going on here? I want to leave. [raining] You're free to go. That's not what I meant. Call Ray's wife. She'll pay. Not when she finds out you've been banging her old man. [laughs] [laughing] [grunts] [pants] [ominous music playing] [squeaking] [guitar playing] How about a dance, sweetheart? She don't like you, Gary. Maybe she's too good for your country ass. Why don't you like me? Oh, you smell so nice. [chuckles] [dramatic music playing] What the hell you're doing with that little gun up here for anyway? Pulled it out lock up about two years ago. Some gangbanger got lit up on 52nd street in the West Side. I read the report too. Witnesses say it looks like he was dancing the jig. [camera clicks] Today's the day that I get to watch someone dance exactly like that little greaseball did. [ominous music playing] [camera clicks] You finally going to tell us what you plan on doing with us? What's it look like? They're going to hunt us. What? You expect us to just walk out of here so you can hunt us down? No gun. If you keep your wits about you, and you might make it out alive. And you never know, you might wind up killing us. With what? Rick, Gary, and I used to go hunting up near Buck's Bay. We went for years. A hundred white tails, wild boar, but the outcome was always the same. Like my father always said, once you've hunted men, animals just don't cut it anymore. You're going to feel a rush of adrenaline like you've never experienced before. All your natural instincts to survive are going to take over. You're going to feel more alive in the next few hours and then all those wasted years. This island is three miles from shore to shore surrounded by water in all directions. There's no way off this rock. Even we can't leave not until morning when the boat arrives. Please, don't do this. Start running. [gunshots] [ominous music playing] [birds chirping] [ominous music playing] [cries] I can't go. [panting] We have to move. We can't stop. If we stop, we die. What do you figure? Four hours tops. Remember that couple from Florida? That was a complete wash out My balls barely broke a sweat. Yeah, TJ got the first kill. He got lucky. The wife was the size of a truck. You and I flushed it right toward him. You're getting old, Rick. You couldn't catch her today if you tried. [dramatic music playing] [camera clicks] Squeeze in a little bit. Why? For Luann and the kids. [camera clicks] [thuds] Are you OK? I'm not OK. None of this is OK. Why us? Why us? It doesn't matter now. If we just do this, we'll figure it out later. Yes. Come on. Let's go. Up. Let's go. Up, up. [dramatic music playing] What do you figure? I don't. They're going to go straight in until they hit the water and double back the way they came. I don't think so. I bet they run straight up the blind side of the lake. Follow it right around. Not a chance. Ten bucks says you're wrong. I'll take that bet. [dramatic music playing] Over there. Where? Over there. Are you sure? I don't see anything. Never mind. OK. Split up no more than 100 yards. If you see something, fire a single shot in the air. The other two will come running. Sounds good to me. What do you say, Rick? I'm OK with that. [dramatic music playing] We've got to get back to the cabin. There's going to be a gun, a knife, anything. No. They won't be expecting it. No. Please. [dramatic music playing] I hear them. Hide. They're coming. Listen to me. You've got to get out of here. Run and hide as fast as you can. Please, go. [breathes shakily] Gary. [gunshots] [grunts] They got my fucking gun. Oh, well that's just great. What do you think of the odds now, Gary? Fuck you, Rick. Now, they're armed. It doesn't change a thing. There's the three of us. We know the terrain. Besides, if it was too easy, where would the fun be? They got you good. You could fuck off too. You're lucky. I'm hit plenty of times, never felt lucky about it. [grunts] [grunts] Is that a gun? [exhales] I'm so sorry. I should be here. You should be home. I'm sorry. No. No. [inhales, exhales] There's nothing ever you feel sorry about. For everything else. [cries] [dramatic music playing] They're coming. Run. Run. [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshots from a distance] [gunshots] [grunts] [screams] Run. [cries] Whoa. Whoa. God damn, what a rush. [cries] Here, take that. Get my good side. But you don't have a good side. [camera clicks] Make sure I get a set of prints. [coughs] We got a live one here. Yeah. That's 10 bucks you owe me. Best 10 bucks I ever spent. [muffled cries] Adios. No. [dramatic music playing] [ray gasping] He's mine. [gasps] [gunshot] [dramatic music playing] [cries] [sobs] [sniffs] [dramatic music playing] [gunshot] [grunts] I think I hit her, 50 meters straight ahead. Rick. I think I hit her. She's got to be close. Did either of you see which way she went? I didn't see shit. Wow, you were the one who shot her. Start a skirmish line, 50 feet apart. We'll head straight down to the water. Remember, she's got Gary's gun. It's got to be out of ammo by now. Don't bet on it. [ominous music playing] [cries] Stop. I thought I heard something. No, forget it. [pants] [dramatic music playing] [gun thuds] If anyone hear me, please, I need help. This is an emergency. Is anyone there? BROOKE (ON RADIO): Hello. Is anyone there? Please help me. I've been kidnapped by three men. - Damn it. BROOKE (ON RADIO): Help me. Cap. What's the range on that thing? How the fuck should I know? [door creaking, closes] [door creaking] Backroom is clear. It's clear. She's gone. Rick, she's got your rifle. [ominous music playing] There's no way she can get off the island, right? You've been hunting five years here, Gary. You know there's no way off of here. Not unless she swims. Impossible. It's 20 miles from this island to the mainland. An average male with good shape could probably do what? Three miles, tops. She's alone, and she's scared. There's no way she's getting out of here. [ominous music playing] [ominous music playing] [spits] Bitch is bleeding. We got more over here. We need to put her out of her misery. [flare gun shot] What are the odds of someone seeing that? [ominous music playing] [ominous music playing] Hold up. What the fuck? What the hell is it? [gunshots] Fuck this. [screams] [rick grunts] Fuck this. Fuck. [screams] Fuck it. Stay down. Fuck. Get me out of here, TJ. Oh, my God damn leg. [grunts] Stay down. You got-- you got to help me, man. [gunshots] [rick grunts] I got something for you. [gunshots] [rick grunts] Rick, hold on. You got to help me, man. [grunts]S [gunshots] [rick grunts] You got-- [gunshots] [rick grunts] [gunshots] Oh, my God damn legs. Stop moving. Gary, get the hell out there and grab Rick. I'm not going out there. I'm hit! Oh, my God. Help me! [rick grunts] Oh, God. [screams] [ominous music playing] [grunts] Grab that medical kit. Fuck. It's empty. What? It's fucking empty. [grunts] [screams] God damn it, Rick. Hang in there. Don't you die on me. [grunts] I'm going to fix you up. Whiskey. [pants] [coughs] You remember that time that you rolled your sister's car off the road. You went right through that damn windshield. You're invincible. Don't leave me. We can't do anything until we kill that bitch that fucked you up. It doesn't look so bad, Rick. You knew that she would start shooting. You saved her own skin. Don't tell Luann. Stop talking. I can't-- Save your energy. I can't-- I'm going to fix you up. Is anyone there? Can anyone hear me? Please, I need help. We say it was a hunting accident. He's been shot a dozen times. We were drinking. He went out at night, never returned, probably drowned. I'm still alive you, assholes. We're talking about the worst case scenario, Rick. I don't feel so well. That nosy wife of his is going to ask questions. The Sheriff's Department is going to ask questions too. Nothing we can't handle. But Luann, she's not going to let this go. BROOKE (ON RADIO): Can anyone hear me? This is an emergency. I'm on an island somewhere near Oakland County. One of them is a police officer. Is anyone out there? Please respond. What about plan B? Plan B should have happened hours ago. You take this. You kill anyone that comes through that door. [gun cocks] Except me or Gary. [ominous music playing] What are you going to tell your wife? I haven't though about it. We need get our story straight. You all right? Yeah. We've known Rick a long time. If he survives this, we're going to have to put him down. Those wounds are going to require an awful lot of explaining. Where the hell are you going? Figure it my way. [ominous music playing] [pants] [gunshot] [grunts] Get up. What are you going to do? [gun clicks] [pants] [ominous music playing] I'm going to get even for the arm. We'll carve up this pretty little face. [screams] [grunts] [pants] [gunshots] [screams] [ominous music playing] [door creaking] Where's Gary? I'm so cold. [breathes shakily] You'll get me off this island, yeah, Teej? Yeah. I'm getting you off the island. I'm so cold. Fuck. [gunshot] [dramatic music playing] [loud explosion] [ominous music playing] [loud explosion] [ominous music playing] [gunshots] [ominous music playing] [loud explosion] [ominous music playing] [gunshots] [pants] [loud explosion] [grenade explodes] [grenade explodes] [door creaking] [ominous music playing] Remember what I taught you, TJ. [gunshots] [ominous music playing] [lighter clicks] How the hell did you get-- Held my breath. You cunt. [gunshot] [gasps] [inhales deeply] It wasn't personal. [lighter clicks] [screams] [loud explosion] [dramatic music playing] [birds chirping] [peaceful music] [MOTOR BOAT SOUND FROM A DISTANCE] [gunshots] [grunts] [water splashes] [motor boat revving] [dramatic music playing]
