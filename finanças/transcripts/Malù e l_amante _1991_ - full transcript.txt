"MALU VE AMANT". Hey dear! Joelle... I thought you were on the patio, painting as usual . No Frank... I was trying to take advantage of this beautiful day. I think of nature... Everything around is so relaxing. Also at noon. Yes, there my dear! I just wanted to get in. Darling... Tomorrow, Charles will be released from prison. Will he be released? Many years ago? Time moves fast sometimes. Unfortunately for us it seemed to be flying... But it wasn't the same for Charles. And what did you do when you found out? I was the one who let them be released . And come back here... What did you say At least I could, Joelle. Charles was in prison, with no place to go. Nobody accepted. Wherever he goes... I'm sure of that. He confirmed it in a letter I got from him . He will be released for good and will work here for us. We have to give him another chance . I hope you're right honey. You have done a wonderful act of humanity. I'm glad you understand me. Honey, I had a really good idea. I thought our property was very nice and clean. Charles will give us a helping hand and we will succeed producing a new wine variety. A beautiful wine Our vineyards are the best in the region. It reminds me that I left you for a long time, my dear. You're beautiful This whole area is gorgeous. I want to go for a walk to the village. Rest dear, see you later. Ciao, dear... Charles... You will come back here tomorrow. Charles... The idea of ​​rebuilding makes me happy. But I never mastered the desire to hold you in my arms , even just once. You will no longer leave me. See you again tomorrow And this thing is absolutely, I don't know why it gave me so much emotion. I feel like a mare... with ankle and mixed. And who wants to escape from the sky, And feel free again. There is a caring lover. Also violence... Did you do anything for me? And the sad memory of what happened next . I wish you were a bad dream. A nightmare... In a dark night and without a moon. You always miss me. I've been thinking of you for all these years. And to your letters. Like some expressions of love. But they made me enjoy it more than you can imagine . Frank never knew he wrote them . And I felt the taste of jealousy. You were my only true friend And I've never felt so alone. I have read them so many times that I almost learned about them from the outside. And now that you're back again, I'm a little disappointed. You will no longer write to me. How many times have I read and reread these expressions, And your words very common and simple but all are more convenient. Let me remember all these moments And feelings I've never felt for a long time And I never forgot. Charles... I was lost somewhere when you were with me While you hold me in your arms And we completely abandon our love . Things are going better for me. I recovered after the accident. I'm glad to hear that. And lady, how does she feel? Okay okay... Even if he's alone with me. Like the flower of the desert. He is young, full of enthusiasm and meticulousness. He needs fun and entertainment . The countryside doesn't have much to offer . For me, it is an ideal place to live and work in silence . But for him it's like living in exile. Oh, finally! Come on dear... Come to greet Charles. You'll see that she'll be happy to be back. It gives him great pleasure. Hello woman! Hello Charles! I am happy to see you again And I'm happy to be able to work for you again . Dear, take Charles to the barn. It is true that I am in a rather unstable situation. Yes sweetheart You, Charles, always kept them perfect. I'm just waiting to be able to do this again. Sir, aren't you coming with us? No, I'm busy, I can't. I have to keep working on my book . But you can go together. Go with him, Joelle. We'll see you late. Soon... Nothing seems to have changed here. No, they haven't changed... They were the same as you left them. It's been a long time. And you are as beautiful as ever . You have not changed at all. Do you know how much I've thought about you all these years ? Take care of yourselves! How warm are your hands! I wish you Let... I can't go through this again. Please... since you left I got very close to my mistress. You can't understand how I feel. How important is it to me? Try to understand me. He did everything for me. To have a happy life. And I've been waiting for this moment. But now... I'm afraid! How do I want to get rid of this suffocating opposition ? That's what told me, no... Do not do this! I was happy then. Reluctant to see what will happen. Each of your moves Even the simplest I was having fun And I was excited... "She loves me, she doesn't love me" while playing And you covered me with flower petals. Sometimes you made me scream It forces me to discover new emotions. And finally the sentimentality overwhelming me . You were the best play partner. And the guilt that exists between us, It was great! I felt happy And with enthusiasm in all our meetings... I look at you and remember everything that happened here . You have not changed at all. You are all the same. You haven't changed. You have become more beautiful, you are a real woman. You can't imagine how much I want you. You don't know how long I've been waiting for this moment . I can't believe I touched you again. I love you Joelle! And I want to make love to you as always . I want you to be alone. Don't think anything. I want you to feel angry how do you leave no doubt I am here now Leave yourself in the arms of love. Your boobs are so strong and countries Like the pearls he puts in his throat. Let me feel... Yeah that's it! Only... Come back my love... Then... I want to kiss you all over Yeah... Oh yes, how beautiful you are! Time to go... Hello Charles! Hello Mr Conte! So how's the deal going? Are you doing Yes, no problem. Thank you... Did you see how much damage the snow did last year ? Yes I saw But I think like the whole valley covered in snow you must be very beautiful I really like sitting outside. When I was in prison, I didn't get enough air. I was out of my mind. I suffered from the park, I am the dog. Here in the stables things were still the same. Nobody took care of them. I saw the roofs of the roof grow. There are some cracks here. So how did Miss Joelle look? You can't come here! What were you doing I wanted to find the lady. The lady doesn't come back before noon. He went to the village. Ah, he went to the village. But why did you follow me? Why are you spying on me? Why? I'm not spying on you, why would I do that? I do not know... But I think you know very well. What do you want to say? You're beautiful Does he like to wear a lady's clothes once in a while ? What do you want to say? Take off those clothes! And she tries on the lady's dress instead. I'm sure it will be very good. Now I want you to look in the mirror. Put a hand on your hip... Stay, don't move! I do not know why but there is no life in my pictures . Something missing. Try to laugh... Now damn it! Really? Yeah! You will become the "Mona Lisa". He was such a bad man! Hello there... Hello ladies! Have a nice day! I think there is something missing from this table . Does not appear mu The park is devoid of life. What do you think Yeah... He seems devoid of emotions. He may need love. When women are borrowed, their lips turn red, and her breasts, more voluminous And all the intimate parts become more colorful lively... Come on! I'm out of here. You were here honey! Did you have a nice day? How does this work, little "Raphael"? I was n't very inspired by the pattern I had. But Charles gave me some suggestions that proved to be very appropriate . Did you notice anything strange about him? No, I don't think so... why are you asking me Charles said a certain claustrophobia is in jail. He must have suffered a lot, always trapped in the cell . not to see anyone. without a woman... Has it made any progress? No, not at all. No progress. why are you asking me Honey, are you jealous? It was a joke. Really? It doesn't appear to me. Talking about Charles is enough for me. Do you remember our life before the accident ? Sometimes you think you sacrificed everything for me . No... I don't want you to say that. I love you... Nobody forces me to stay here with you. My love for you is my reason for living. Now I leave you with your reading. I'm a little tired . I think I'll have a good rest. Go my love. Goodbye My dear... Charles... Charles, have you been waiting for me for a long time? I've been waiting for you all night. I wish you much Wait, beat the buff! Let's make love slowly as I love. I wanted to call you if he saw that you weren't coming . You're crazy! What is in your mind? You're even more beautiful tonight. There is a kind of special light in his eyes. Ah, Charles! You're sensitive to the way you touch me . You make me feel so wet. How you touched me that no one else did. Hello woman! Hello there... Did you see how happy the countess lady looked? Have a nice day! Hello there... I see you're back at work. Don't tell me you're jealous now. Have a nice day! Hello there... Prepare me now.

You are so sorry for me. You thought you could do whatever you wanted with me. But... In a relationship like ours... It shouldn't be revenge. If you want to love me without consequences, You have to admit what they've done. without any anger. And leave yourself Any fantasy. I really hate you when I hear you say that. In the name of love you have to go through all this jealousy . I didn't betray you to make you suffer. because I love you And you love me more than women in the world . But I can't have you I did this for what I did. I did it for you! Have a nice day. Hello dear. What a beautiful flower you have dear! This is very good. Ah, Frank... The perfume of flowers burns me. You are more beautiful than all roses. It was my great pleasure to wake up and find a room full of flowers . Thanks, it was like waking up in a gorgeous garden. Actually, it was me who did it. I cut the roses and thought it would be good to take them to your room . I admit it was an excellent idea , Charles. Anything to make my wife happy . And her happiness makes me happy too. You started your job early this morning. Why did you come to have a cup of coffee with us ? Come on, sit down. Come on, what are you waiting for? Bay Count ... Come quickly, the doctor is here.

Look what I found. But dear... Do not say anything! You don't have to confirm me to me. The game is fine if it doesn't take too long. And even more beautiful if it doesn't cause anyone pain. What are you trying to tell me? What does it mean? What are you talking about I do not understand No dear. Charles exaggerated this time. I didn't think he was capable of such cruelty . But this time his betrayal devastated me. It's time to end all this. Did you know everything then? You always knew that... You knew everything...
