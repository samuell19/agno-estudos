FILIPOV This is a very old fairy tale that was first told many centuries ago and still lives, and everybody tells it in a different way. People of the Fairy Kingdom, hey, people of the Fairy Kingdom! The Royal Herald is speaking to you Can you hear me? O, what a pleasing message have I to deliver to you! Everything is prepared for the ball in the Royal Palace. Dear invitees to the ball, o, dear invitees to the ball! Do not forget that you are invited! Something miraculous will certainly happen at the ball. It is not without a reason that our land is called the Fairy Kingdom. Do come, do not forget, on my word of honour, you won?t regret it. The King got up at 5 in the morning he personally dusted the grand staircase, Then he paid a visit to the kitchen, had a row with the chef, enraged, he relinquished the Crown, but after all tempered justice with mercy and now he is running along the Royal road checking that everything is fine. There! Can you see him? - Good day, Mr Forester. - Good day, Your Majesty. Forester, I wanted to ask you, why do you shiver and look back all the time in these latter days? Maybe, there is a monster in the forest, threatening you by mortal danger? No, Your Majesty, I would kill the monster! Maybe thieves came to the forest? Nothing of the sort, Your Majesty! I would fight them off at once! Maybe an evil wizard haunts you? No, Your Majesty, I would sort that out! What drove you to such a condition then? My wife. - Really? Upon my soul, I married a cute woman, but she is harsh. They twist me round their little fingers! I mean my spouse and her daughters from her first marriage. They?ve been getting dressed for the Ball for last three days they have trotted us off our death! I mean me and my little daughter, who became a stepdaughter because of my weakness... I am resigning, I will cloister! if such heartrending things can happen in my kingdom! Live your life on your own! Shame on you, Forester. Hush, hush, Sire, if my wife hears you I am dead! Don?t put the blame on me! My wife is a very special woman. Her sister, who was very the same as she is, was eaten by an ogre. He got poisoned and died! You see what a poisonous temperament has this family, but you are angry with me... Well, let it be so, I am staying on the throne, give me my crown. Forget it, Forester and come to my ball with your daughter. Cinderella? Sire, but she?s such a little child! Do as you please, but bear in mind that I will have such a fest, that will make you forget all of your hardships and sorrows. Farewell! Everything is familiar here... the clock... the broom... frying pans... fire iron... fire... fireplace... Let?s have a heart-to-heart talk. Do you know what am I thinking of? I think about the following: My mother and my sisters were invited to the ball. But I wasn't... It isn't fair. Is it? They will dance with the Prince. But he has never heard about me. They will eat ice-cream ... But I won't. Though no one in the world likes ice-cream as I do. While polishing the floor, I learned to dance. While suffering insults in vain, I learned to think. Listening to the cat?s purring I learned to sing. And no one knows about that... It hurts, doesn?t it? I want it so much that people notice what kind of person I am. But I want people to notice it themselves. With no please and bother from my side. Because I am very proud. Can it be true that it will never happen? Can it be true that I will never have joy and happiness? Indeed, it is very bad when the one who deserves to go to the ball never does. One can fall ill because of that! I want happiness to come to me. It is so boring to receive presents only from myself. on my birthday or on holidays. Good people, where are you? Good people, hey, good people? Well then... I will comfort myself: when everyone's gone, I will run to the Court park, I will stand beneath the windows and feast my eyes at celebration at least from afar. So you are dancing... I am rushed off my feet from weariness preparing for the King's ball, but you are just dancing. I care about you much more than about my own daughters. I haven?t given a single notice to them for months. While I foster you all day long. Where?s the gratitude? Where?s the gratitude? I know you wanted to run away to the ball today. Only when everyone?s gone, mother, for no one will need me then. Follow me, Cinderella. Do you know, my little girls, what was this good-for-nothing doing? She was dancing! Dancing, before you have sewn down my ruffles? I sewed them down a while ago, sister Anna. Dancing, before you ironed my collar? I ironed it a while ago, sister Marianna She was dancing! Thoughtless about how tired I am preparing for the royal ball! I made some coffee to refresh you, I?ll bring it right away. Keep where you are, you impudent one! She knows all the answers! She does everything to drive us crazy! She likes nothing better than arguing! Where?s your father, you ungrateful? Where?s this monster? I saw him in the forest nearby. What was he doing there? - He was speaking to the King. To the king? To the king! To the king! He was speaking ... To the king? Why didn?t you report that to me? Where are you, poisonous snake? Hellhound! Hey, hellhound! I?m here, my darling. Where were you? - In the forest. What were you doing there? I wanted to fight the Mad Bear. What for? - To rest from domestic cares, my darling. Look into my eyes, look into my eyes! Is it truth that you have spoken to the King? - The very truth, my dear wife. Have you begged the King to raise your wages? Somehow it hasn?t come to my mind. Well, have you begged the King to register me and my little girls in the Book of the reigning beauties of the Kingdom? What are you talking about, darling, is it possible... So, you have spoken to the King and wheedled nothing out of him? Of course, but we?ve been chatting just like friends. Poisonous snake! They have upset me before the ball. Why do I have to do everything? I work like a beaver! I run and I bustle, I beg and I quiz, I beseech enchant.. I get and I gain. I?ve got such connections that the King himself could envy me. But that monster... No! That is settled then, I will drive you out of your own house. And you will die in the forest, and your Mad Bear will eat you! No, dear mother, don?t! Look what I?ve made. I made this rose from satin shreds. It looks just like real one! A disgusting flower. What for an ugliness! What a bad taste! You could pin it to your ball dress, it would be so beatiful. But if you don?t like it I will throw it away. Give it to me! Give it to me! You've said it was tasteless! But you've shrieked it was ugly! My dear little girls! Don?t be angry, don?t quarrel! To cease the quarrelling I will take the flower myself. Are the ball dresses, which I told you to sew down during one night, ready? Yes, mother. Show them! What a bad taste! What for ugliness! Cinderella, you wanted to run to the park and stand beheath the king?s windows. You may do so, my dear. - Thank you! Just put the rooms in order, before you go. Wash the windows, wax the floors, white the kitchen, weed out the garden, plant 7 rosebushes under the windows, sort 7 bags of beans: separate white and brown beans. Get to know thyself, and grind coffee beans for 7 weeks. But I will not finish even in a month. Hurry up, my dear, hurry up. They tease me calling me Cinderella because I work at fireside not sparing myself I go round and round the kitchen I am busy with oven all the time I am always in cinders Because of my kindness I slave away from morning deep into the night. Anyone can command me but no one wants to thank me. I hide my sorrow I sing instead of weeping I even smile Will I ever leave this place with its cinder and soot Hello, goddaughter! Godmother! Dear godmother, you always appear all of a sudden! Yes, I like to do so. But last time you appeared out of the dark corner behind the fireplace. Today you come over the air! Yes, I am such an inventor. You still can?t get used to the way I change! I am delighted with that, I love miracles so much. There wasn?t any miracle so far. We, the true fairies, are so emotional that we can grow old or young as easily as you, humans, turn pale or red. We grow old for sorrow and grow young for joy. You see, how glad I am to meet you. Today you were offended 24 times. Of which for nothing... - 24 times. Today you deserved praise... 333 times. - But they... Did not praise you even once. I hate those who want to do nothing and adore those who work hard. I adore you and hate your evil step-mother. I would turn her into a frog a long time ago, but old woman has too many connections. Let?s talk about you. Do you want to go to the ball? Yes, godmother, I want it very much, but I can?t. Don?t argue, you?ll go there. It is very bad when the one who deserves to go to the ball never goes there. But I have so many things to do, godmother! Today the friends will work instead of you Boy! Hares will weed out the garden, mice will sort the beans, cats will grind the coffee beans. What about the roses? Roses? Roses will grow on their own. In a moment I am starting to work miracles. I adore this job. Boy, give me the magic stick! First of all, let?s roll a pumpkin here. Thank you, dear godmother. Wait, silly girl, how can you coach without horses. Thank you, dear godmother. Wait, silly girl, how can you coach without a coachman. Miracles are not over. Coachman! Coachman! Bring the coach to the doorsteps after 5 minutes. May I go now? O, dear, in fact, you are still such a little girl. How can you go to the ball in such dress! Is it me? - Yes, it's you. You can trust me, I can see through the people. Even through those, whom I love very much. I can see clear that even in splendid ball dress you stayed the same nice, industrious, kind-hearted girl. Stay like this. This will bring you luck. Let us go now, I will hand you into the coach. Excuse me. I am not a wizard, I am just a apprentice. But let me make a few remarks, listen to me. Let?s listen to him, he?s a good boy; an excellent pupil, he reads a lot, even makes verses. Speak, boy, we are listening to you. Dear Cinderella, I watch you working all day long. You have magical hands, amazing patience and you are very kind. You don?t know that, but I?ve become your true friend. Though I am not a wizard, but merely a apprentice. let me tell you that friendship can work real wonders. These glass slippers will bring you luck! Take them. Thank you, dear boy, I will never forgive your kindness. And now, my dear, remember the most important thing. You must return on the stroke of 12. At midnight your new dress will turn into old and poor one. The horses will turn into mice, coachman into rat and coach into pumpkin. Remember that. Well, I will remember that. Boy! Thank you, dear godmother. Good evening. Finally. I?m very glad. May I present myself? King! Don?t curtsey on stairs, it is very dangerous. Good evening, don?t take your glove off, I am so happy that you have come. Good evening. O, Your Majesty, it?s such a annoyance! Your beautiful bertha torn and everyone can see that. Where? - Look! What a horrible thing! What an outrage, why haven?t my courtiers reported that? Cowards, liars, flatterers! I am resigning; I am shutting up in cloister immediately! Since my courtiers behave so badly, farewell, my good lady. How can you get upset because of such a trifle? Oh, oh, oh! Don?t worry. I will mend it so no one can see it. Do you have a needle and cotton? - Sure. I am careful. In this case, let it be so, I am staying on the throne. Sit down, Your Majesty. Like this, to make it handier, just sit calm and don?t move or I can jab you. You can?t imagine how glad I am! I adore new mysterious guests. Certainly, the old friends are good. but I know everything about them. For instance, Puss in Boots; he is a regular fellow, clever cookie, but when he comes he takes his boots off and sleeps at fireside. He never plays or runs with me. Or Tom Thumb, he always plays for money. Hide-and-seek. Try to find him! That's too bad! The most important thing is that their time has passed, their fairy tales are played... While you are... I, the fairytale king, tell you that you are on the verge of an amazing event! Is that so? Upon the word of King?s honour! It is as simple as that! It wasn?t worthy to be noisy and capricious, was it? Wonderwork, nothing can be seen! You?ve got magic hands! And you speak so simply, so frankly. I?m so happy to see you! Let?s go. Prince looked at me 3 times, he smiled once... - 3 times. He draw a sigh once. Once. 5 altogether. The King said to me: ?I am glad to see you? once, Once. Ho! Ho! Ho! - once. Move along, there is a draught here ? once. Once. 3 altogether. What do you need these notes for? Don?t to be an intruder on our joys, monster! He always grumbles. Such a ball... 5+3=9. Total: 9 expressions of high regard from persons of the highest rank. Now, my dear, I will gain my object to enlist you in the Kingdom?s Book of the reigning beauties 10 expressions of high regard! Prince, sonny! Look, who?s come to visit us! Do you recognise her? Who is she? So? Mysterious and beautiful stranger. What a smart boy! True enough! Why are you so pale? Why are you silent? Sire, I am silent because I can't talk. Don?t believe him, he can. Verses, speeches and compliments. Let?s go! I am going to introduce my court to you! Haven't you get tired on the way? No, I haven't, I took a rest on the way. Let me introduce to you a girl, who has never been here before. Supernaturally sincere and fabulously sweet. Let me introduce my ministers to you: The minister of ball-room dancing. Sir marquis de Pas de trois Your Majesty, I know this girl! This girl is a beautiful flower. A very striking compliment. Don?t you recognise me? I don?t dare to. Now we are going to play the Royal forfeits. No one deposits any forfeits and no one redeems any forfeits, Everyone will do what the King wants them to. The first forfeit is yours. How do you find it here, my lady? - I like it here very much. Then, could you sing something and dance for us? All right. She doesn?t make difficulties! What a good girl! Sonny! I?m going to sing you a little song. A bit of magic. It just makes you heart high. It is called "Good beetle". Kids, form yourself into a ring! Once there lived a good beetle, an old mutual friend He never muttered or shouted, just buzzed with his wings and strictly forbade to quarrel. Kids, form yourself into a ring! I'm your friend and you're my friend, an old devoted friend! We got to love our old good beetle for his kind soul, what a merry fellow! Kids, form yourself into a ring! I'm your friend and you're my friend, an old devoted friend! Who is that nice old man, who is dancing without music? He is the kindest wizard in the world. He can refuse no request. Evil people often took advantage of his kindness, so he stopped his ears with wax. Now he can hear neither requests nor music. Arrange it that my daughters were enlisted in the Kingdom?s Book of the reigning beauties. Listen! The first. Beauties. Excuse me, madam, The next forfeit is yours. Make something good, magical, miraculous and pleasant for all, who are present. It's as simple as anything, Your Majesty! - Wonderful! Don?t be afraid! I?m not afraid in the least bit. I expected the wonders from this night. Here they are! Yet, where are we? We were carried to Wonderland. Where are the others? Everyone is in the place he feels pleasant. Wonderland is vast. But we won?t stay here long. One can be here just 9 minutes 10 seconds and not a moment longer. It hurts, doesn?t it? Do you feel sad? I don't know... May I ask you a question? You are welcome. A friend of mine ... He?s a prince, too, he?s quite brave and decisive, too, and he met a girl at the ball, too. He liked the girl so much that he was wholly at a loss. What would you advise him? May it be that the prince just seemed to like the girl? No, he knows for sure that nothing of the kind ever happened to him and will never happen again. You are like a dream or a vision What if I scare you away with my clumsy touch? What if fall into forgetful sleep for a moment and wake up in despair? What if fall into forgetful sleep for a moment and wake up in despair? Dear, kind, mysterious guest. Dear, kind, mysterious guest. Your time is up, your time is up, end your conversation. End your conversation... Are we still in Wonderland? I don?t know. I think we are. What do you think? - So do I. May I have the next dance with you, o charming young lady? I beg your pardon, marquis, but our guest has been already invited by me! You know, Prince, there have been some days when I got so tired that I was dreaming about sleeping even when I was asleep. But today I'm so happy; I am dancing and I want to dance more and more. Wonderland! What a success I had there! What a hairdressing saloon is there! What a perfume is there! Thank you! The wine we drank from a magic glass in the magic tavern was fabulously excellent! Try to guess what am I thinking of? You think it would be lovely to have some ice-cream. I am ashamed to confess, you are right. Finally, I am happy! An hour, a full hour and 15 minutes. One hour! Dear Cinderella! I have a very sad news. Sad? - Don?t get upset! The King ordered to set back the clock one hour. He wanted guests to dance longer. That is, I have nearly no time left? Nearly. I'm begging you, don?t get upset! I am not a wizard; I am merely a apprentice, but I think everything can still come to a happy end! The best ice-cream in the world, I've selected it personally! What's the matter with you? Thank you, dear prince. Thank you for everything. Thank you for your care. Thank you for your politeness, tenderness and kindness. You are the best person I ever met. Why are you talking to me so sadly? Because I have to leave. No, I can't let you go! I thought it over, after the ice-cream I would have told you straight that I love you. What am I talking? Don?t go! Stay! I may not! I am not as ridiculous as it seems to you, it's just because I love you. It?s no good to be angry with one because of that! Forgive me! I love you. The boy got so active! Dear Cinderella! I brought this ruby glass of ice-cream to comfort you. Do me a favour, taste it. I will return the glass to the palace. Do you want some? What happened? Are you sick, my boy? I knew it! I am absolutely healthy, Sire! It is bad to cheat the old man! 40 serves of ice-cream! You have overeaten! Such a shame, 40 serves; you haven't allowed yourself such a surfeit since you were 6. Your stomach is frost-bitten! I haven?t touched the ice-cream! Really? Indeed. What?s the matter with you then? I fell in love. Yes, I fell in love. with our kind and mysterious guest. But she ran away so fast, that this glass slipper slipped off her foot and fell on the stairs. You fell in love? You fell in love? I am resigning. Deuce! Hell! Why nobody reported me that he has grown up? I?ve sung you the whole song about it! Really? All right then, I'll stay. The boy fell in love. It is such a happiness! - It isn't happiness! Nonsense! - She loves me not! Nonsense, she does, that?s why she didn?t stay for supper! No, papa! I feel offended! I will find her! Hello! Gatekeepers of the Fairy Kingdom, can you hear me? We are listening, Your Majesty! Has the girl crossed the gate of the Fairy Kingdom? Having a single slipper on? How many slippers did she have on? One! Blonde or brunette? Blonde! How old was she? About 16! Pretty? Very pretty! Nobody crossed the gate! Why did you questioned me so thoroughly, fools? Out of idle curiosity! Do not let anybody out, all right? Lock the gate! Soldiers, do you know what love is? My only son and heir fell in love for real. Do you understand the situation? They had had an important conversation and then she ran away. That can happen. - Don?t interrupt me! What can we do? I will go with the minister round the country watching through spyglasses, but you will search the girl with the help of this glass slipper. The girl who can fit the slipper upon her foot is the Prince?s bride. Is it clear? It?s clear! Now go to my treasury; there you will be given seven-leagued boots for swiftness. I wish the girl to be found before nightfall. Good morning, madams! Excuse us for our discourtesy. It is known that it is improper to appear without the boots before the ladies? eyes. Begging your pardon, madams, they are seven-league boots. I see, Corporal, why did you put them on? To catch the prince?s bride, madam! These boots exhaust us, they take us far beside the target. You won?t believe it, madam, how many girls we left behind immediately after start. And even more girls were frightened out of their wits. Let me ask your daughters to fit the slipper. You are welcome, which size? I don?t know, but the girl who can fit the slipper upon her foot is the Prince?s bride. The slipper fits upon the foot of one of my daughter, corporal, call for the King! I'm telling you, the slipper fits upon the foot of one of my daughter! I would be very grateful. You know what I mean? I will load you with money! Thank you, but what about fitting? Two barrels of wine! I can?t do it without fitting, an order is an order. Anna, Mary-Anna! Draw your big toe in! The heel. Have you another size? - Negative, madam. What is to be done? Cinderella! She has magical hands, she can do everything! Cinderella! Cinderella, sometimes we were at quarrel with you, but you shouldn?t be angry with us because of that. I aways meant well to you. Repay me with good! You can do everything, you have magical hands! Mother! Cinderella, put this slipper on... - On my foot! Anna?s foot. If the slipper fits her foot the prince will marry her! Mother, I can?t... - Cinderella, I am begging you, my dear, beloved daughter. But I can?t! - Cinderella, help Anna! Help Anna! Not at any price! Go and say farewell to your father. I will drive him out of his own home. You know about my connections; he?ll lose his head, he?ll die in prison or in dungeon. Don?t! Hey, hubby! - Mother! All right! I... I?ll try. Congratulations, Anna! Your Royal Highness! Well, now they will get it hot! I will introduce my own rules. Don?t cry, Mary-Anna The King is a widower, I?ll get a place for you, too. It?s a pity the Kingdom is too small, there's little one can afford. Well, I'll scrap with the neighbours, I?m good at it! Soldiers, go to the palace on bare feet, follow the Royal mother-in-law! Forward, march! Hurrah! I scared you, my child! Don?t be afraid, I?m not a villain or bad man. I am just an unhappy prince. I have been wandering in the forest from the first light. I am out of my mind with worry! Do you know who was singing in the forest nearby? Have you met anybody? Never in my life was I so unhappy. I have to find this girl to ask her why has she offended me. I can?t see you, but somehow it seems to me that you are a good girl. Help me! Wait! Wait! I don?t know, maybe I went mad. Wasn?t it you who was singing here, in the forest? The way you shake your head seems familiar to me! And this golden hair! Show me your face! Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? If an evil wizard put spell on you, I will kill him! If you are poor and simple girl, I will be glad to hear it. Princesses always play hard-to-get. If you don?t love me I will perform many feats of valour and make you to like me! Say something! Where are you? Where are you? Where?s she? Where is she, my dear daughter? Here she is, Your Majesty, my dear son-in-law! Nonsense! Why nonsense? Take a look at her foot! I don?t need to look at her foot since her face shows that it isn?t she. But the slipper fits her foot! It isn?t she anyway! A King's word is a word of honour! The glass slipper fits her foot, consequently, she is the Prince's bride, that?s what you have told to the soldiers. Is it true, soldiers? They are silent! No-no-no, it's a done deal, my dear son-in-law! Damn it! What a mess, what should we do, marquis? Of course, we should dance! What?s the matter with you, my beauty? You are walking lamely, my beauty! Softy! The slipper ran away from you, beauty! It is impossibly small for you! What a wizard managed to put it on your foot? It is too small for you either, miss! It doesn?t matter! The unknown beauty has lost this slipper in the palace, too! But it was a bit large for the unknown beauty. Intriguer! I will complain to the King! I will complain against the King! Your Majesty! It?s all right, madam, don?t be upset. Maybe you have one more daughter? She has! Please, don?t chuckle! Who is this girl? My own daughter, Cinderella. She is as kind as I am! For father?s sake she helped Anna to put the slipper on. But I didn't know anything! I found her weeping bitterly in the garden. Look what she wept at! Another one! It?s her! Look at her, it?s her. Prince, where?s the prince? What for fabulous piggishness! I can stay in this kingdom no longer! You snake! Follow me, my little girls! Who do you think you are, you just put the crown in your head. Where?s the prince? His Royal Highness... To chase away his worries, he ran away, at 11 o?clock, local time. It?s my fault, why didn?t I tell everything to the prince? Now everyone will be lost, the prince and I... the king and the whole kingdom! Prince, dear prince, where are you? He?s here! He?s here! Sonny! I am not a wizard, I am just a apprentice, but friendship can work real wonders! Good boy, I give you a distinction. Change into other clothes, Cinderella, your wedding-day is near. Get married, get married! Yet Cinderella hasn?t told if she loves me. I don?t like when people are disturbed while sorting out their relationship. Well, my friends, we found our way to entire happiness. Everyone is happy. Except, old Forester?s wife, but it's her own fault. Connections are connections, but one must have conscience, too. One day you will be asked: what can you present? And no connection can help to make a foot small, make a soul great and a heart fair. Page-boy will find his happiness, too. A daughter will be born to the prince, she will be the spitting image of Cinderella. And the page-boy will fall in love in her. And I will gladly bestow my granddaughter in marriage to him. I adore these wonderful features of his soul: faithfulness, generosity, ability to love. I adore these fabulous feelings, which will never come to an... end. THE END
