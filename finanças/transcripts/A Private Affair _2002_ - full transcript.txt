I'm taking the 21 in direction Porte de Gentilly. 11 days earlier It's my husband's cousin, so I can't say no. The Missing Persons Bureau has given up. What about the cops? When it's a missing adult... we need evidence to justify an investigation. No blood, no theft, nothing... Still no success after 3 months. I'm not the sort who gives up. With 10,000 disappearances a year, 5% are still missing after 6 months. I've never believed those figures. This investigation won't achieve anything. I'm asking you as a favour, Manéri... If you haven't found anything after a fortnight, we give up. What about Ressler? Mathieu's responsible and will also give support. 6 months is too long. Your client will lose money and you'll lose a client. That's not your problem. How old is she? She turned 22 in December. He's right, 6 months is a long time. If we haven't found anything within a week, we'll drop it. OK, François. Go see what you can come up with. May I remind you that you have a sister... called Nadège, who turns 40 next week I'm having a dinner party on the 23rd, and I'd like you to come. Call me back to confirm. Kiss kiss from your sister! This is Gilles. Magnard's organizing a game tomorrow night at 9. Call me. We're counting on you. Ciao! All these lead pipes that snake under the gardens... have not changed in 3 centuries. Rachel Siprien... born December 11, '79. 3rd-year student of biology, populations and ecosystems. Resided at 24 Rue d'Hautpoul in the 19th. No criminal record. No known political affiliations. Yes? I was waiting for you. Ah, Marion, I'm sorry! You're a pain in the arse! I was working till 2am. Sorry. You're always sorry. Want me to come over? Not tonight. - Is he there? - No. You're a pain in the arse! I know, but... But what? What? "BUT" what? You know very well... When will you be back? I'll be in Tunisia with Alain for 8 days. Where in Tunisia? Hammamet. Sylvie and I made Paul in Hammamet. Maybe you'll come back pregnant. Alain's been strange lately. I wonder if he suspects something. If you like, we can cool it for a while. Really? Let's think about it. Good morning, sir. - I've an appointment with Mrs Siprien. - This way, please. The police looked for months... And you, a week? The difference between a cop and a private investigator... is one of time dedicated, and people's perception. People rarely open up to a policeman. Do you have children yourself? A son. I've only ever had the one daughter. You've no objection to this? When was the last time you saw Rachel? A few days before her birthday. We had lunch in town, in a restaurant near the Louvre. How was she? She seemed fine. We talked about our next holidays. She was in visit Phillipe and me in Corsica... to give us a surprise. She loves Corsica. We have a house in Vilccia. Do you know Sagone Bay? No. It's beautiful... It's still unspoiled by tourists. You are married? Divorced... but I live with someone. And her father? I called him 5 months ago... He's been in touch with the police... about following their enquiries. She was 9 years old... the last time he saw her. Do you know anything of Rachel's friends? Very little. I saw her once with a young girl. Her name is on a list I prepared for the police. Here. The keys to her studio are in there. Nothing's been touched... I'll keep the place intact... until my daughter's found. Have you seen any other investigators? No. For 6 months the police have treated her as a runaway... but I think that's enough. Did Rachel have a boyfriend? She'd broken with Frédéric several months ago. They'd met at a university function. That's what she told me, anyway. Rachel never told me much. She was always a secretive child. I don't really know anything about her life at all. Details you may have remembered since... that police are unaware of? Something insignificant that may be of use to me? Last summer... Rachel complained of neck pains. It was something trivial. I don't know why I mentioned it. I'll keep note of it. No, I just mean that... I never found out exactly what was wrong. Philippe goes to Paris regularly. He's a journalist on the local paper. We've been together for 8 years. He's very fond of Rachel It's horrible, you know... I wouldn't wish losing a child on anyone... and not knowing what happened./i> You can't even mourn... is what is most painful. Find her, Mr Manéri. Please find her! Rachel was very independent. I really don't know her very well. She moved out... before her mother and I started living together. I doubt I can tell you much. The police questioned people who knew her. Without wishing to be pessimistic, 6 months is a long time. Too long. I wasn't expecting her to bring in a private agent. I frankly disagree with the idea. The police are better equipped for that sort of thing. Don't be upset if I say I think it's useless. I'm not upset. I'm sure you know deep down, that Rachel is lost. Possibly, but it's my job. I wouldn't call it a profession... I don't envy you, Mr Manéri. What about personal files? Social Security hasn't made any payments. Her bank account's frozen. That's all there is. I thought you'd got out of missing persons. Obviously not. I imagine her mobile phone account's been checked? The record of the last 6 weeks. And incoming calls? That's all I have. They weren't asked for? No idea. You can get them? How long? 2-3 days, or more. How's Elisabeth? She finishes her radiation therapy this week... They bastards have given her the run-around... But she's in good spirits. Yes? - This is Clarisse, Rachel's friend. Hello... Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. I can see you can be tomorrow at 10am in front of the college. Perfect. How will I know you? I'll be carrying a camera. - See you tomorrow. - See you. A camera? Bloody original! Straight. Right now, I don't have the money. 50,000's a lot of money. I'll give you a guarantee. Where will I put it? Gentlemen. What are you going to do? - Come back to my place. - Yes, but... About the money? It can wait a bit... right? I guess so. Feel like a drink? - No, I'm going home. - 5 minutes. Sure? It'll be OK? Rachel never told me much. She was always a secretive child. I don't really know anything about her life at all. Find her, Mr Manéri. Please find her. It's not a trivial matter. I think the shock is delayed. She's Catherine's only child... The pain is more intense. Did you notice anything strange about her behavior? The police have already asked these questions. Rachel acted normally. Did she confide in you? Why me, more than her mother? I don't quite understand your question. Did you know her father? No, he's been living in Guadeloupe for years. His daughter's disappearance hasn't affected him. Your relations with Rachel were purely platonic? Nothing sexual? I ought to smash you in the mouth for that. You can try, but it will be useless. There's never been anything between Rachel and me. Hello? Hello? François Manéri? Clarisse Entoven? We didn't see much of each other before she disappeared She'd been skipping classes for several months. Did you know her old boyfriend, Frédéric? Of course. Did they get along well together? They seemed to. Have you seen him since her disappearance? I see him around. They'd been apart for quite a while. Rachel started going out a lot. She must have met quite a few people. But recently we hadn't been together much. We saw a lot of each other in the 1st year of college. And then... there was Frédéric. We saw each other but in a different way. And stepfather? Are you asking me if she was sleeping with him? Do you think the lack of a father creates an attraction to older men? You're weird. You ask questions, but you disregard the answers. There is a diploma to become a private detective. It's a very serious course. Do you know about it? I've heard it mentioned. What do you think about it? Couldn't care less. Good... Rachel is not home... I like the place. I don't know if I'll keep on. Some nights are quite dead... Another day, anything can happen. Rachel knew a waiter... I think they got along well. He's not here every night... But Freddy's in charge when Mr Le Guern's not here. Shall I get him? Yes please. I need to see who was working at the time... We go through 8 waiters a year. Could I see Mr Le Guern? Not much chance of that. Is he in this evening? I help you, because I'm interested. But he hates snoopers. He's a Breton... Doesn't like being questioned. Do you have his phone number? Not easy... This job of yours... What do you make? 10,000? 20,000? Have you seen that film with the crazy actor... I forget his name... Big dark-haired guy. He smashes a beer bottle on his girlfriend... and then he just stands there like an idiot. Weird, eh? You seen it? It's a bottle of coke. Not beer. Are you sure? I'll call tomorrow, for the name of the waiter. Sure... no problem. Take a swig! Don't try it again! Just drop it, understand? You drop it! Fuck! Bugger! Shit! Fucking shit! Yes? You got the message, cunt?! - How many were there? - Two. - Had they followed you? - No, they knew where I lived. You'd be best off telling the cops. What can I tell them? I got mugged? So? What more can I say? It mightn't even have been about this case. - I feel bad about it. - How do you think I feel?! I signed on for a week. Not 3 days. As a private agency we don't get into matters of public interest. - I understand. - I'm not sure you do. We handle civil and commercial cases, not criminal. Don't do anything stupid. Stay here. I'll go. The application's in your name? Yes. You stink! Hi, can I speak to Freddie? Speaking. Who's this? Manéri, remember? Ah, yes... the shit-stirrer? That's me. I haven't the time... Can you do it today? How about Tuesday? Can't do it before then?? No, impossible. - I'll try again tomorrow. - OK, bye. - Bye. Tomorrow's fine. Don't smoke in the car. Your dog doesn't mind... Do you Boris? Even pigeons get lung cancer. Why not dogs? How long, to match names against the numbers? That depends whether they're on the red list. I'll fax you tomorrow. Alright? Where are we going? The FNAC store. What the hell for? Test No.1... I'm Francois Manéri, I've 2 broken fingers and I don't know where Rachel is. Yes? It's Gilles. I've left your creditor at your office. - Already? I have to admit, it's one of my clients. He's worried... wants to know what you're up to. - Did you reassure him? - As always. I have to go... I'll call you later. Hello... Are you Chris Lother? - Sorry? - Chris Lother? No. Mr Lother doesn't live here? There's no Chris Lother here. Sorry, I must have got the wrong floor... Test No. 1 I'm Francois Manéri, I've 2 broken fingers and I don't know where Rachel is. We were together 6 months. That's either a long or short time... depending on what you remember. She knew me better than I knew her. But I do know one thing... She's not the sort of person to disappear. Rachel is capable of crazy stuff... things beyond her age. But to go off, without telling anyone... that wouldn't be like her at all. What sort of crazy stuff?? You know the expression... Some people shrink from growing... others grow from shrinking. No riddles please. I don't understand. Rachel... one might say... was nothing like she seemed to be on first acquaintance. Seemingly very reserved... even distant. She has a habit of putting herself down. But get close to her... Get to know her... she's completely different. A wild and unpredictable creature. Are you still in love with her? I miss her. I miss her every day. Why did you split up? It's always the case that one loves more than the other. I think she left me before I became too hung up on her. The more detached she became, the harder I hung on. It was pathetic. What about Clarisse Entoven? Clarisse is something else. The other half of Rachel. She was no friend to me. When the cops asked where Rachel might be... I said wherever it was, it was against her will. Wherever. Yes? Hello. I'm investigating the disappearance of Rachel Siprien. May I ask you some questions? This ID has no authority. You can call the Federation of Private Investigators. I saw a report on TV Last year, 1,300 young people disappeared in Paris. The police found 99 per cent alive. - That means there are 13... - Who've disappeared. "Disappeared" means dead, doesn't it? It must be exciting. What must be? Trying to bring people back. It's not what I like doing best. So why do it? Do you remember the last time you talked to Rachel? Very well. What did she say to you? The police have already questioned me. I didn't tell them anything. I've never needed them. Those last times, she was coming home late. I did not see her often, but... I could hear her. Didn't see much, but I'm not deaf. Was she living alone? Not all the time. Sometimes, there were several up there. That's not to say they were noisy. Enjoying life, eh? Did you ever see any of her friends? You've seen my door? I don't have a peephole. My wife has nagged me for one but I don't see the need. Did you notice any changes in their behaviour? Yes... There was another one. I'll tell you about it next time... Like another one? Don't I know you? I don't think so. Yes... Perpignan, 2 years ago. You must be mistaken. May I sit down? I never forget a face. Not even damaged ones. Everything else, but not the faces. Runs in the family. I'd rather be alone. You're as good as that now. I believe in the fluttering butterfly, in determinism and all that... I think we're linked to the cosmos and our lives affect the universe. Will you buy me a drink? Can you help with 2 or 300 francs? I'll pay you back. Give me your address and I'll drop it back in a few days... I'm not a thief. Scram! You were nicer the last time. More generous, too. I don't do drugs. I've got a kid... He lives with my mother in Brittany. You're persistent. I'm not shaking your hand. You should be in bed with a chick. I was thinking of you this morning. It's disgusting, that job of yours... Hassling poor people. Wherever that girl is... SHE doesn't want to be hassled. The law says we can't give the address of an adult without their consent. Not even to their relatives... It's the law. You're law-abiding? I try to be... Mostly, I try to be. Between December and June we had 2 waiters. 2 brothers... Vincent and Arnaud Walt. - Not sure about the address. - Thanks. Not at all. How about a quiet lunch together some time? Better not. Why not? My love life with girls is complicated enough... Who mentioned love? How do termites recognise one another? Do you remember the last time you talked to Rachel? Very well. The termites exchange signals... What did she say to you? She asked me a favour. What sort of favour? The police have already questioned me. I didn't tell them anything. I've never needed of them. Taking me for a fool. Hi. What's happened to you? Paul's getting dressed. Good morning François... Josselin. What's happened to you? - Coffee? - No thanks. Shit, I'm late! See you later. Bye, François. Isn't he a bit old for competitive sport? I put cough syrup in his bag. He takes it morning and evening. In the 2 years since we separated, I've never understood what you see in that guy. I can do what I could never do with you. You're kidding! Listen François, you lead your life as you see fit... Spare me the jealous ex-husband performance. It baffles me, that's all. So, I wonder. It's not about money... Certainly not the physique. So what is it? His arse? No?! So it IS his arse! Fucking hell! You don't give a fig about me, Sylvie. That still hurts. Yeah. Still don't want a coffee? You got a beer? It's not even 10 o'clock. I'm kidding. Don't forget the syrup tonight. Don't worry. - Do you cough a lot? - Yes, all the time. You caught cold at the pool. We didn't go there this year. - Where are we having lunch? - Wherever you like. I'd like a hot dog. Do they have them at KFC? No, we can go there tonight. 3 days ago, 2 walkers and their dog discovered Rachel Siprien's body. The remains of her badly decomposed body were buried 60cm below the surface The odontologist cannot make a formal identification due to massive injury to the jaw. Underlying similarities allow the examiner to say that it was the same person. Find someone else. She was no more than a child. I want to know what happened. It has to be left up to the police. A corpse means death... Death means mourning. Mourning means nothing to me. I won't give in to another pain. I want to know what happened. Just allow the police to do their job... The police got nowhere in 6 months. I want you to continue your investigation... Whatever it costs. If that's not enough... let me know. It's not possible for us to contravene... No bullshit please! Rachel was 22 years old. How does one reach 22 buried in a forest, bound hand and foot? Her lower limbs, her head, her skull... were separated from the rest of the body. I'm very sorry... The keys to her apartment. Not as much as me, Mr. Manéri... Not as much as me. I wanted to see you, on the off chance... The stuff of hers we found in her apartment didn't tell us anything... I wondered if you'd found out any stuff you might tell me about. What sort of stuff? Let's go over what you might know. It'd be stupid to not pass on any tips. I don't have any tips. 3 days on the case is not long. You talked with the old guy, the neighbour below her? The only valueable information from that building. The others didn't know who their neighbours were. And? And what? Nothing strange about that old guy? Not particularly. Yeah... Hi... here you are. Inspector Bonnis... François Manéri. Don't you want to take a look at those photos?? A boar had started eating parts of the body. It was lucky the passing walkers had a dog that found it. How did she die? Sorry, you'll need to ask her mother to get information. Good luck with it. Thanks. We'll keep in touch. If you need me... You have my number. You have a photo? Very pretty! Should have a nice arse. A part of her body was found in Fontainebleau a week ago. How did she die? No idea. The police find 700 a year in forests. That's only 2 a day, but... The mother wants the investigation to be continued... as to why her daughter died. - I understand her. - I don't. So how will you pay me back? There's plenty of work at the agency. Can I keep the photo? How much can you lend me? Well... I don't know. How much do you need? 50 all up. I couldn't find 50 right away. Alright... I can give you 15 cash now... and then we'll see. This is Nadège, you haven't forgotten dinner tomorrow night? If perchance you still haven't bought me anything... I'd be very happy with flowers. Love you. Leave your message, thank you. Wasn't what I had to tell of any interest to you? Memory is the engine of old age. Sometimes I hold things back. Don't leave it too long. There is nothing sacred in this world... Quickly! At first there was no question about living in Paris. At the time, the rents weren't so high. It was my wife who insisted. I don't give a damn about this... I'm waiting for you to tell me more about Rachel. Yes, of course. What I know about that kid is a trifle delicate. I'm not even sure of its significance... to your enquiries. Don't think I'm being spiteful... and please allow for my age. Apart from visits to my niece... my life revolves around this apartment... but 6 months ago, more so... in the apartment above. You see... This is where I sleep... or rather, stretch out... underneath HER. I became very accustomed to sharing her presence. I finished up knowing her without ever seeing her. It often happened... that I heard her making love. Several weeks before her disappearance... it sounded different... As if she had changed partner. What they were doing was... How would you describe it...? Less violent... more carnal, perhaps. Wait a moment. One evening she came and asked me if I'd mind this for her for a few days. It was a present for her boyfriend. She didn't want him to find it in her absence. - What boyfriend? - I don't know. That's all she said. She never came back for it. And I never opened it. That's all I have to tell. Now you know as much as me... Will you let me know if you find anything? - I'm not allowed to. - But you still could? - No I can't. - Yes you can. Still don't want a coffee?? You got a beer? It's not even 10 o'clock. I'm kidding. When will we get back together? Stop it, François! I just don't like seeing you with that jerk. I miss you, Silvie. You don't know how much I miss you. I know, but... Stop it! 25,000... maximum. Thanks. Ask Mrs Siprien to keep the apartment. Watch your step. One of your word-games? You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. - You're in form today. - I don't want trouble. - Don't worry. Take Mathieu with you. 'Bye. Hi Mathieu! Hi Martine. When will you come to see us? Patrice and I still love you. I'm really busy, I'll call you. - You will call? - Yeah. Between December and June we had 2 waiters... two brothers. Not sure about the address. - Mr Walt? - What do you want? To ask you about Rachel. - Who's that? - Rachel Siprien. You a cop? I'm working privately for Mrs Siprien. - Can I come in? - No, you can't. Maybe a little later? Yes, later. What did you learn? Age about 30, 1.8 metres, 80 kilos, short brown hair. Where are you going? I don't talk to guys wearing illustrated pullovers. What if he clears off? Yeah... How did she die? Cardiac arrest. Everyone dies of that. You know what I meant. She was killed. Her skull was fractured and her face smashed in. She left this before she disappeared. What is it? No idea. Why are you giving it to me? You were her friend. You can open it. What are you going to do with this? I don't know. There may be fingerprints on it. They'd belong to whoever sold it. Have you been separated long? 2 years ago I was on a case in Perpignan. When I got back, she'd left with my son. It happens. What do you know about Rachel's mother? Only what Rachel was happy to tell me. She believed she wasn't her real mother. That she'd been adopted at birth. What sort of bullshit is that? She believed in life after death. She was into reincarnation. Leave your message, thank you. This is Marion... I'm back. Call me. I hope you're well. I don't care, you know. You're free. You too. The more I see of you, the more I discover... similarities with Rachel. Impossible to find a florist! That's alright, I don't have a vase anyway. - And no complaints? - Of course not, why? You know my brother? Hi... nice to see you. - Hi. - How's it going? - Insects eat each other. - They don't get on. - On the contrary. - He confessed? No, his mother gave him up. How could you kill someone for a car? Shove your scissors in their ear! Oh, really! Some animals just kill for fun. Some for a BMW. AND in front of his mother! What are you working on at the moment? A woman who disappeared. Any progress? Parts of her body were found in a forest. After 72 hours, only insect scavengers can give us a date. After a week, when it's rotten... entomologists classify larvae in the body. Cheese? No thanks. Claude, you're not doing anything... The champagne! You've been waiting for it? - Yes? - It's Mathieu, is it a bad time? No, just wait a sec. Hang on! Try and pay me back before Christmas. Thanks. Yeah? Your guy spent the afternoon pumping iron in Humes' gym. He got changed and went to the "Double R"... a private club at Porte de Vanves. You got the address? - Hello. - Hello. Do you have your membership card? No. Not yet. I'm sorry, it's a private club and you need a card to enter. I'm a friend of Mr Walt. Do you want an annual subscription or a visitor's pass? How much for a year? 1,000 francs. I'll take it. Excuse me. You like that? This your first time? Yes. You can masturbate if you wish... Maybe some other time... At first you watch a lot... Then one day, you've had enough. Don't know why. It's strange. I don't know why it is. Do you come here often? Not often on weekdays, there are too many lonely guys. Apart from Thursdays which are reserved for couples. A different type of clientele. Are you married? Divorced. I didn't want to go out tonight, but my wife wanted to see people. She's the little blonde over there. Too late! You can't see her head any more. Goodbye. Goodbye... see you! I lied. When you asked if Rachel saw other guys, I lied. When she was with Fred, she was sleeping with an English guy. A university student. Did he know? I don't think so. Have you told anyone else? No. Not even the police? They're only interested in the step-father. Two days ago I was asked what I thought of him. It's totally stupid. Does it change anything? What? What I told you about Rachel. I don't know... I know fuck all. In the name of Thy Son, Jesus Christ... who rose from the dead... bring Thy peace to our wounded hearts... support our faith and make us feel... the strength of Thy love, here and now... Amen. - You're not happy, eh? - Not really. Murderers like to watch their victims being buried. I've agreed to continue with the case. Because of the photos? Mrs Siprien asked me to change my mind. You're allowed to. How far have you got? At some point I would like to know why she died. We want to know the reason, AND who it was. And how it was done, as well. What do you think about the step-father? A sad case. Yeah? See you. We'll stay in touch. I've got your number... Just in case. Did you ask for help from an agency in Paris? - No. A friend knew someone in Lyon. You know his name? Jean-Claude Gasse. How long did the search go on? About a month. What were his conclusions? I never received any. Your ex-wife was aware of the investigations? No. 5 months ago, she told me about Rachel's disappearance. The police never gave me much information. I didn't lose a young woman... Rather, a 9 year old child. When Catherine and I separated... I went abroad. I was thinking it might be... for a few months... Circumstances decided otherwise... Catherine looked after Rachel... and I never came to see her. Why did the agency never give you a report? My friend told me that Jean-Claude Gasse was dead. Dead, how? He didn't tell me... My wife and I have 2 daughters. They're with their grandparents at Trois Rivières. Do you know Guadeloupe? If you're ever there, come and visit us... It's a beautiful country. How's he going? He has a lot of regrets. Don't you get tired of this life of yours? Wouldn't you like a girlfriend? A stable relationship. Neither for the moment. You'd rather smoke alone in bed? What do you think of ME? Right now, I'm not thinking about you at all. What's that saying about us? A boar had started eating parts of the body... It was lucky the passing walkers had a dog that found it. How did she die? Sorry, you'll need to ask her mother to get information. Last summer... Rachel complained of neck pains. It was something trivial. I don't know why I mentioned it. I never found out exactly what was wrong. Got a problem? Set to "auto"... no need to focus. Always give priority to emotion over technique. Cut it out! You forgot to call me. Fuck you! - Can't we talk? - Get out of here! Yesterday I was at Rachel's funeral. I told you to beat it, or else! I've got 10 questions at 200 francs per answer. Everything OK? Okay then. Sure? Yeah... don't worry. Wait in the hallway... I finish in half an hour. There's something stinking in your kitchen. Let's move on to the next one. - What about the widow? - Distraught. Jean-Claude Gasse left 3 kids. A brain hemorrhage at 36! No records at the agency? He worked alone... with his wife. She looked after the paper-work. She's all screwed up after the death of her husband. Do you think he talked to the old man? It's possible. I can understand about the cops... But why give the camera to you rather than the other guy? This case is rotten, completely rotten. So what about the "Double R"? - Sophisticated. - Sophie who? Next time, take me along... I'd like to see all those arses. There's an age restriction. And they don't let guys in... wearing illustrated pullovers. - Bad time? - Not at all. Can I come in? Hello. What are you waiting for? I'll go. Boris is alone in the car. - You'll call me? - Yeah. As soon as I have something. What are we doing about that guy, Chris Lother? - He's untraceable. - Forget him. - OK. - See you. Feel like a drink? No thanks. I'd 've called you but I'm on a demanding case. How was Hammamet? You look great with a tan. It's over, François. The two of us are finished. No reaction? What do you want me to say? You're right... Say nothing... I'll miss the neighbourhood. Your fingers were Alain's doing. He hired 2 guys to scare you. Sorry. I'll leave. See you some time. Yeah... some time. What were you looking at out the window? - Nothing. Next time we'll do it at my place. I'm not sure about my father... But you'll get along with my mother... You're nearly the same age... - Fine. Do you still have your parents? We haven't seen each other for a while. - Are you fighting? - No... just lost touch. Do you want me for tonight? You don't have to. I can find someone. I told you I was interested. I don't get a kiss? It's been a long time since anyone took a photo of me. I used to enjoy it. I'll send you a print. No, I mean the bedroom above. The noise of the bed... would go on for ages. You've seen another private investigator, several months ago. That's possible. - You didn't tell me. - You didn't ask me. What did he want to know? I don't remember any more. I've had enough of your bullshit. Even the gift package story doesn't hold water. Where did this camera come from? I'm talking to you! Tell me, you piece of shit! - I found it. - Whereabouts? - On her landing. Why were you up there? I went up as I hadn't heard anything for several days... I saw the package by the door, that's all, I swear! - Was there a card with it? - Yes... but I threw it away. What did it say? I didn't open it. I'm gonna...! Happy Birthday it said... Happy Birthday. That's all, I swear that was all. I replaced my brother, when he went to Ibiza. He's Arnaud... My name's Vincent. The owner didn't mind the change. She used to come at weekends to watch him when he studied. Rachel was pretty weird. A crazy type... Liked to experience things to the extreme. Did she come alone? She met lots of people inside. What sort of people? Not the sort you'd want to know. Sluts from the "Double R" and elsewhere. People who pay for stuff. How did you know her? Through my flatmate, Arnaud. We'd been at school together, in Rouen. That's your 10 questions. Were they sleeping together? Careful... that's got nothing to do with this. She often came to our flat, but we were all just pals. Anyway, he went to The Balearics a month before her disappearance Do you know any other friends of hers? She led a pretty complicated life. She was seeing some sort of doctor... Physiologist. - Who told you? - My brother. I didn't give a stuff about Rachel, Not my style. I go for black Whitney Houston types. Or Jackson's little sister... She's cute. Some idiots say she's a dyke. - Like that other one... - Mr Manéri...! The bald singer... What's her name? - Mr Manéri! - Stevie Wonder. Mr Manéri! Yes? Come in. I'm listening. I'm the one opposite, you could see watching with binoculars. Why do you do that? To be sure. Sure about what? I can put you onto a colleague who can treat your disorder. Does the name Rachel Siprien mean anything to you? What are you looking for? I'm enquiring into a girl's disappearance. Come in. Excuse me. What does this have to do with me? - Yes? - Bad time? - Yeah, a bit. About tonight... my mother's having a dinner I want to be at. No problem. You sure? Call me... Leave you to it... Love you. Sorry, I usually turn it off. Rachel's body was found at Fontainebleau. Rachel?! Her mother has hired me to look into it. No... Initially, it was a game... She was looking me over. Then one day she had a reason to see me professionally. What was wrong with her? Cervical osteoarthritis... rare at her age. I saw her here for 2 months before she disappeared. I called her several times looking for signs of life at her flat. I gave up. After a while I accepted it. Was the camera left by you? A present for her birthday. I left it at her door. She and I had plans. She wanted me to come to Corsica... to meet her parents. How was she during that time? I wanted to put her life in order She never wanted to talk about it... But she was in a relationship when we met. Did you know she used to frequent a sex club. It was part of one of her courses. That's what she told me... Are you married? No. Were you living with someone? Not really. I was seeing a woman from time to time. Are you going to tell the police about me? I don't know. Tell me a bit more about that relationship before Rachel. I only have this model. Put it on. Enjoy the evening. I'd love a drink. What do you want? A beer. Where IS that stupid woman? Martine? Martine? What the fuck are you doing here? Do I know you? Inspector Rossen. Quite a crowd here tonight, eh?! Are you being funny? - I'm with a girlfriend. - What's her name? This is a surprise! Several weeks before the disappearance... Rachel Siprien's car was towed from parking at the Double R. The towing bill was in the glove box. The car is in a private parking area... which Mrs Siprien didn't give her the key to. A friend of Rachel's told me about this place. - What friend? Sorry, I'm bound by professional secrecy. You're a nobody, without any rights. The law obliges you to tell us anything which helps with our enquiries. If you start fucking us around, Manéri... you're gonna finish up in deep shit! Martine! Gentlemen... Yes? You left a message. Mrs Siprien told me you were in Paris today. Hi. Hi. Coming with me? - I've a meeting in 15 minutes. - This won't take long. Can you tell me about Clarisse? - Who? - Rachel's friend. Are you investigating Rachel's life, or mine? Right now, it's yours. We saw each other just the once, in Paris. I regretted it right away... and I told Catherine everything. That's the truth. She wasn't the sort you'd only screw once. Taking Martine to the "Double R" orgy club... that's a bit much. Plus a one-year subscription and a bottle of champagne! What about that club? Still need her and Mathieu to follow up. Martine's on a social security fraud job. And where are YOU at? Your reports are zero. I've got a vague idea. Must be pretty vague! The jealous wife who kills the mistress is a bit 1950s isn't it? When can I have them? Do you want them today? Around 6 tonight would be fine. Is this the only way you can do it? I've listened to a lot of lies. I'm suspicious. Is this idea of yours serious? Something to check out... Just in case. Stick to it Manéri! Hi. I was in the neighbourhood. Can I see Paul? He has judo on Fridays. That's right... Friday judo. Sylvie has her English lessons. It's alright, I just took a punt. Want to come in? No, thanks. How's the job? Fine, thanks. - You? - Great. I took a few days off to rest. Sylvie told me that another day you tried to kiss her. I'm not upset, François, you're only human. It just proves to me that you're unhappy. If there's anything you need... don't hesitate, we're always here. It's in difficult times that you know your true friends. How many games have we won together! What a pair we are, eh? Shut the fuck up, Josselin! We do love you, François. Don't be scared, I just want to ask you something. Why 2 fingers? 2 fingers, 2 doors. My nose is a present. Tell me more about the relationship before Rachel. Sandrine Pujol, the cabinet secretary. I slept with her when I was feeling depressed. - And then? - She said she was in love with me. If I stay with her it's because of other doctors... I feel sorry for her but she's good at her job. It's Gilles... lunch tomorrow, if you'd like to. Yeah? You still coming tonight? I don't think I can. I'll give you the address anyway. Got a pencil? Just a sec. Yeah? Hi... I'm giving you the address. 10 Rue du Pré Gentil à Montreuil. My swing! - Hi. - Hi. You live alone here? My mother has another part of the building. This wing was for my sister and me. I've had it on my own for a year. She got married last year. Is there a problem? I can't stay. So why are you sitting down? I've a couple of questions. You never stop, do you. Did Rachel know you were having an affair with her stepfather? Is this an investigation question, or personal? I did put it to Rachel. She reacted rather badly. It soured our relationship. You enjoy shit-stirring? Do you think I'm a slut? With a bit of luck, it was me who killed Rachel! A slut who kills a whore... not bad, eh? I can't wait for you to start... Start what? A slut who kills a whore... not bad, eh? Did I wake you? I'm taking my Saturday walk. If I can see you, I'll give you a lift. Damn it! This dog has an infection... needs an operation. Don't be nasty. You know what you can do! Your orgy club's getting me down. The bad part's the age limit. I'm getting it off more than before... But the machinery's still working! Finish up! So much to choose from! At worst, I can just watch. I'm sure most are under age. If you behave, I'll take you again next week. What's happening? Nothing. I'm going upstairs. She's coming back! With the cops! Sorry, I was only joking! You just cancelled next week's orgy. You're kidding me! I don't want to hear you again. That's crazy! Don't move or I'll smash you one. Wait, it's a mistake. I'm calling the cops. No point... I'm an enquiry agent. That doesn't mean anything. Shit! Are you Sandrine's husband? You know my wife? You OK, François? How do you know my wife, arsehole?! Don't you move, you piece of shit! That won't work twice. I'm calling the cops! François! Hey, I live here! You can't break into people's homes! What an idiot. Idiot! Where do you think you're going?! Look out, Pujol! You pieces of shit can't come into my house like that! - Who IS this moron? - A mistake. Goddamn fucking shit! We'd better get you some stitches in that. I'm fucking fed up... I'm going home. He dropped his licence, the son of a bitch! You'll cop it! You haven't noticed anything? Yeah... You're still here. She's not dead. Rachel is still alive. The body in the forest wasn't hers. Look, Clarisse, I've had enough for today... So please, go and forget about me. I still have to get to the first step with you. Just GO, Clarisse! The most incredible thing is to have attended my funeral. Look straight at me... Now do you believe me? What are you playing at? At first I just felt like disappearing for a week. The week turned into months. I found I liked it. I bought the body. You can buy anything for a price. Even a new face. Did you think about what my mother does? The real Clarisse is waiting in the café downstairs. I can ask her to come up if you like. For the last time, Clarisse, stop it! Pujol is not withdrawing his complaint. Breaking and entering and assault, for shit's sake! Your boss'll be delighted! The agency could be shut down. You really are a jerk, Manéri. Can I wait for you here? Shall we go? He's in the car. We're looking at each other. Murderers like to attend the funeral of their victims. With a bit of luck, it was me who killed Rachel! Chris Lother? No trace of blood, nothing stolen... Chris Lother? This case is rotten, completely rotten. Mr Lother doesn't live here? Rachel is still alive. "Disappeared" means dead, doesn't it?
