Because of how I got a cow shed, a bug bed and food for shelter. But I had given them proper instructions before I left. OK, come with me. Oh my god, daddy's here. - What to do now? - I do not know. If I go out for a day, everything goes haywire. Everyone does what they like. I told you my new manager was coming. And I had arranged his accommodation in the new cabin. Then why did he stay in the cattle shed? Sir, I asked her to take me to the guest house. Then why was he taken to the cowshed? Bring her here. - Sir, she is inside. - Inside...? talk to her Why did you tell my manager to stay in the cowshed? Not me, Meena told me to do that. Meena...? Meena is not here. She is in town. Goodbye, Dad. When did you come back, daughter? Have the university holidays started? - Yes. - Come on, daughter. Why did this to Mr. Rajesh? Dad, I wanted to know if he was fit for life in the remote village. Rajesh sir, she has checked you. - Now what do you want to say? - Now I want to ask if I passed the test. Well, come on. - Okay then. - I also own the garden on the other side of the tree. And this garden is bigger than the other garden. But it is different. Compared to other parks, its income is very low. - What could be the reason, Mr. Thakur? - It could be my carelessness. If there is another reason, you tell me. Mr. Mehta, seems like a very intelligent person. No problem. This business is running because of Mr. Mehta. Otherwise it would have been completely destroyed. Sir, the collector has arrived. He asks you. did you see? This time I will not go hunting. - Mr. Mehta. Show him around. - Yes...? - I will come. - Okay. Come on. - Mr. Mehta. - Yes? - Mr. Thakur respects you a lot. - It is his grace. Hello, Lala Bhagatram. Welcome. how are you Good. Mr. Mehta, who is the person in this city with you? He is Mr. Thakur's new manager, Mr. Rajesh. He is Lala Bhagatram. He gets the contract in Mr. Thakur's estate every year. He is a good person. Very friendly. Nice to meet you. No need. He is decent. Mr. Lala is known for his fist fights. - How are you? - You seem to be a talented person. Mr. Mehta said that I am very friendly. If you are by my side, I will sacrifice my blood for you. Have you seen Mr. Rajesh? He is talented. He is also very good with a knife. Even with his eyes closed, he does not miss the target. - Mr. Mehta, give the guest an apple for me. - Okay. here - Mr. Mehta. - Yes? - You seem friendly with him. - What else to do? We should live in harmony. Mr. Thakur does not award contracts to anyone but him. And this poor man suffers loss, but does not break this communion. Rajesh, Bhagatram is really old. I give him the contract every year. Whether the transaction is oral or written, I do it. Mr. Thakur, I also don't want you to break your promise. But I'm your manager. It is my duty to think of your profits and losses. it is good. But what do I do now? nothing Whenever you do business, do it before me. Okay, that's why I made you manager. Sir, hot tea. Okay, do you take good care of the manager? yes sir Every morning I give him tea with 6 spoons of sugar. - How many spoons? - 6 spoons. By the way, from today I will add 7 spoons of sugar.

I raised him with lots of love. Dad, I'll make the tea. Yes, daughter. Do that. - Welcome. - Welcome. Mr. Thakur, when will Bhagatram return to the office? Maybe tomorrow. - How many spoons of sugar? - It's two. Tell us what you like to eat. Will prepare it. Yes, don't hesitate. - Say what you like. - Actually I eat everything. But I love millet bread, garlic sauce and jaggery. Jaggery... does anyone eat that? If this is what he wants, father, why are you stopping him? - He won't be able to eat a bit. - I have already eaten. But I don't remember when or where I ate it. I remember really liking it. - Have you ever eaten it? - No. Proceed. Why did you stop? for you. why is that You can stop by for me tomorrow. Do I need to stay for a guest? You have already checked this stranger. So how can I serve you? - I want to ask you something. - Yes. - I think it's okay. - ask me. Do you feel the wrong way? - Then don't ask. - I ask you... Where is this road going? It takes time to tell. Sir, these ways are deceptive. Yes. I can see that. Besides that, ask for something else? - Show me your hands. - Why is that? I mean they are really lovely and delicate. Why, do you want to attack? If it pleases you, here I am ready. I forgive you. My hand took pity. You may take pity on me and send millet bread and garlic. If you are so fond of eating them, I will send them daily. believe me. I've been eating them all my life. Visitors stay for a while, not for a lifetime. got it? go now That means he is very intelligent. And cunning. He talks sweetly to both of us. - We have to teach him a lesson. - How is that? Revenge of war with war. Revenge with sweet talk with sweet talk. - Meaning? - I mean, if he laughs, we should laugh. - Why is that? - We need to check his comments. He tells every girl the same thing. - So what do you do? - Nothing. It will be a good way to pass the time. Let's have fun in this game. From childhood we played all games together. Let's play this together. But it's a complicated game. Taruna, I'm really bored. So let's have some fun. Let's call him that. He thinks we are in love with him. Let's fool him. - An hour late. - Does that mean? You always go this way at 3 pm. But now it's 4 o'clock. - Are you a detective? - Yes. - A private detective for private affairs. - Meaning?

It is such a beautiful dream. - a dream? - Yes. can i go now When will you play the flute for me again? Meet me in your dreams. I will play it. meet me in dreams I will play it. Mr. Thakur, what is this? - This agreement is made for half of the estate. - Yes. - That's Rajesh's advice. - Rajesh? Mr. Thakur, he doesn't know about our old relations. I have been contracting your garden for many years. I have to suffer losses every day, but I have never complained to you. - Right? - Yes. So this year a contract for half of the garden is given to you. If there is a loss, it is half. Mr. Manager, when there is a loss, it must be all. Will it be a loss? Prepare documents for the entire park. - It is a bit difficult Mr. Bhagatram. - Why is that? The contract for the rest of the estate is given to someone else. Then give him this too. I don't need this. Not the business itself, why my honor? - Yes. - Yes. Do as you wish, Mr. Bhagatram. - Whether we have business ties or not... - You get the respect here. You made me happy. No problem. If not the whole garden, half is fine. Mr. Thakur, I will sign and submit it to the office. Did you see Mr. Thakur? If Bhagatram ever suffered a loss. He does not agree to sign so soon. But Rajesh, to whom have you given the contract for the rest of the garden? - No one yet. - What does it mean? - I will explain it later. - Okay. - Priest, did you understand his trick? - Sir, he is new here. - Gradually he is getting better. - If not, I will fix him. He can only be here as my servant. This manager... - Right? - Yes. Bhagatram's sister, read my palm. Tell me about my future. the future...? You are only there to dream and work. No. That priest... - Who? - One who plays. - Yes. - He read my palm and told me that someday I will be king. And he said that the person I love will be my queen. - Let me read your palm. - What if my brother sees you? so what? I am not afraid of him. I beat him. No. He beats me. - I'm afraid of him. - What are you doing here? I told a story to your sister. Shall I tell you that too? There were two male and female sparrows. Both were in love with each other. A crow came there. shut up Aren't you ashamed to talk to her alone? Tell him I told a story. You are an employee. She is the sister of a contractor. You don't deserve her. right? No. I am not an employee. I am right Kumar. Rajendra Kumar's son... -...and a close friend of Mr. Thakur. - I am complaining to Mr. Thakur. If you don't listen, I'll tie you up and whip you. Get out of here! A shameless girl. go inside I will tell you a story. Come on. Meena Miss, Hariya said you called me. Is it urgent? - Miss Meena. - Mr. Rajesh, you? I was engaged in reading. please sit down. what's up Forget work. listen to this What a beautiful match. It mentions a person who is 6 feet tall. And alone with a beautiful girl. - Mr. Rajesh, can you guess what happened next? - No, I can't. No problem. I'll tell you. - The girl and the boy looked at each other lovingly. - Okay. The boy grabbed the girl's hand. The girl felt still. The boy looked at the girl's face with both hands. Both were so close that they could feel each other's breath. No, my God. He is a city boy, I am a country girl. No, God. No, my God. No, God. No, God. No, God. No, my God. No. He is a city boy, I am a country girl. He is a city boy, I am a country girl.

No problem, God. I'm starting it again. No, God. - What happened to you? - who is? - Rajesh. - Rajesh. You are in my thoughts and even in front of me. You are everywhere. Why did you come here? you called me - I am? - Yes. I chanted. - Mr. Rajesh. - Yes? - There is a problem. - what? - Do you believe in astrology? - Yes. - why? - I believe that too. An astrologer told me that someone is coming. he came He said he was not from the village but from the city. that is true. He said his name starts with "R". that is true. Someone driving a box said. - You are the one who does it. - A box? That is the vehicle you are driving. The name is correct. Career is OK. - Okay, Mr. Rajesh? - What now? Don't ask me that. He said he was falling in love. - what? - You don't understand anything. We are not compatible. You are from the city. I am from the village. A worthless person. tell the truth Listen to me first. So to get rid of this troublesome love the astrologer said... ...to sit here for 30 days and chant the phrase ``No God'' 330 times. But you say "Yes God and Mr. Rajesh". - That's the problem. - Yes. I say "no god" on astrologer advice. But after a while I start saying "Oh my God". Why is this happening? What is happening to me now? I don't know that. But something happened to me too. why is that Is something bothering you too? Not one but two. Two problems. Lord Ram. Lord Ram! Dad, drink tea. Dad, drink tea. Why did you stay outside? Get in. hurry up. Take the basket down. Take this away. - Bhagatram. - Welcome. I told you not to come in. A girl is here. Talk before you come in. - Why did you bring this basket? - You will be angry before you know it. When angry, you don't listen to anyone. This is apple growing season. So I thought to give it to my relatives first. Taruna, go inside. Bhagatram. I have often said that I do not like your work. Take this basket back. But this is a common custom among relatives. Who said you are my relative? Father-in-law, you always forget that, don't you? The whole village knows that she is my girlfriend. - We got engaged when we were young. - But I never accepted this. all right. You should think about it when we get engaged, right? Taruna's mother promised my mother. - But now both are dead. - So I die too? I don't care if you live or die, but this marriage is not happening. - Does that mean I should remain single? - I don't have time for nonsense. If you don't leave soon, I will yell at you and throw you out. Father-in-law, whether you like it or not, I will tell you something. No one can send a proposal to this house as long as I am alive. - Taruna will marry only me. - Bhagatram! These arguments are futile. eat apple They are really tasty. Don't cry, daughter. You will not be punished for your mother's mistake... ...as long as I live. People like Bhagatram cannot harm you. Dad, you are so good. - My child. - Did you drink tea? I will bring Did you see how I tricked him? He thought he was very clever. Let's stop acting now. - If we find out about this, we will be in trouble. - You are a coward. Will someone hang us? I am Thakur's daughter. No one can tell me anything. Still, bullying someone is wrong. Why do you pity him? do you love him You worry for him. I tell you to stop these jokes, but you ignore me. I enjoy this joke. He must be thinking he's very lucky to have two girls following him. But he doesn't know that we are deceiving him. How long will you cheat on him? Let's fool him as long as possible. There is no other entertainment here. Now let's see who is cheating whom. Sister of Bhagatram. - Be my wife. - you idiot. - Do you know what will happen if my brother asks? - What will happen? Let's get married. what else Let's get married. what else My brother will kick you out. There is a gap between us My brother is a big contractor and you are an employee of Mr. Thakur. I am marrying not your brother. - So who will you marry? - With that brother's maid. So I am a maid. I am helping Mr. Thakur. You call me his servant. I call you a servant because you do so much for my brother. Okay, don't tell me that. Then don't call me a servant either. - Then what should I say? - Say anything. - But don't say my name. - Why is that? The wife-to-be does not say her husband's name. My beloved!

Catch it. - If someone sees you outside? - Then let me in. - What if someone sees you inside? - Then let me out. Will no one see this coming? It's okay to see them.

I am going to the Himalayas. I leave. Beloved, look at this. No. Bhagatram's sister, to be my bride. It doesn't matter if I lose my wealth or my kingdom. As I fell in love with you. Hari Singh's daughter is getting married the next day. I might forget, so remind me. Tell Meena to get ready. Sir, you attend other people's weddings. Have you thought about having a wedding at your home? - Are you asking about Mina? - Yes, sir! You have one daughter. I am also thinking about her marriage. I want to find a good young man. - We have a young man in our own house, sir? - Who is that? - Rajesh. - Rajesh. He is a good young man, but we know nothing about his family background. - You can find out if you ask. - I will definitely ask. Thanks for the reminder. I like Rajesh. You go now. why so? I'm here now. Look, Taruni! This is not right. You teased me, but you got angry when I did it. - Who played a joke on you? - your... ...and your friend Mina. It is not true. "He probably thinks he's lucky because two girls are crazy about him." "He doesn't know we're tricking him." - Who said that then? - You are very bad. You listen to girls talk. And two girls are cheating on an innocent boy. is it right? So, that's why you called both of us at the same time to get revenge. - Not revenge, just a joke. - a joke...? This joke has now become a reality. I wanted to tell you the same thing. This joke has become a reality. Then, Meena got her love. - To Meena...? - Yes. I don't love Meena. That's for you. Yes. to you. - Right...? - Yes, sir. You can get anything you want with your wealth. No priest. Wealth is useless. - Why is that? - I want to give up my wealth for poor her. - Who is she, sir? - My girlfriend, Taruna. - And that...? - Rajesh. Is this world no place for a good man like you? Take my example. I get salary from Mr. Thakur. But I work for you. That's why I will give you a good advice. Get the girl just like you got rich. Take this axe. I bow before you. - Beat my head off with an axe. - Let me go. keep away. If you're mine, I won't bother you again. - Have you seen your face in the mirror? - Yes. I am better than your Rajesh. Do you want to compete with Mr. Rajesh? - Bhagatram is not afraid to compete with anyone. - Leave me alone. What I can't get by love, I get by force. leave me alone From today you belong only to me. right? leave me alone run? - Leave me alone. - How is that? come here leave me alone leave me alone - Help me. help me - Shut up. leave me alone help me I have heard that no one can compete with you in wrestling. You should not use the other hand. I can fight well. Isn't that right? I will not spare you. Did you come now? I didn't see. I'm coming with a parade to get your attention. - You should also wear the groom's suit on that day. - I am ready. When should I bring the wedding procession? You are very stubborn If someone listens to us? Don't know about others. But I am very happy if your father hears it. my goodness. why is that I touch his feet and ask consent for this. I will say that your daughter consented. No. You should never say that. - Why is that? - I don't deserve you. That's absolutely right. I'm not pretty like you. - You don't take these seriously. - Is this wrong? I thought I would talk to your father today. I now believe in heaven. Maybe that's why fate brought us together. You will protect my honor. You will save me from disgrace. And you will marry me. It makes me shudder to think about it. What would happen to me if you didn't come there that day? No. Don't think so. We should be grateful to life for bringing us closer. A small gift as a souvenir. - Sir. - why? Sir lorry motor arrived. Lorry motor? - Yes, that long one. - What nonsense. Mr. Thakur, I called a truck. It must have been brought. - Why is that? - Please forgive me, you don't know much about business. I gave half of the estate to Bhagatram. Then the other half of the fruit can be sold directly to us in the market. Then you can know about your profit and his loss. You say Bhagatram is a fraud. Yes, absolutely. - What am I doing? - Send that truck driver in. ok I will do that. Go quickly. Gauri. Where did she go again? Fool, are you back here? - I came to give you a message. - What message? - You're fired. - Why is that? Earlier you got half of the estate. Now even that will not be available. - Why is that? - Mr. Thakur and Mr. Rajesh... ...Talked to a factory owner. They are going to build a factory on that land in partnership with him. - But how does he do that? - Ask Mr. Rajesh. Ask soon or he will leave tomorrow. Your theft has been exposed. Is he going tomorrow? He does not know what to do? What will you give me in the city? Say whatever you want. Anything you like. Then I will bring you a beautiful saree from the city. I don't wear them. - Then a skirt like this. - Get them here. I will bring jewelry. The train leaves at two thirty. It's already two. Say what you want. - So shall I tell you? - Yes. Come on! Rajesh. What happened? Rajesh! Look, son. open your eyes Your mother came. - Rajesh. - Thugs attacked him. We still don't know who they are. Rajesh. The doctor said there was nothing to worry about. He has been given medicine. you calm down Until he comes to his senses, come on. Sir, this is Rajesh's mother. Rajesh's mother! Look at her. Come on. I was scared when the thugs hit. I could not imagine what would happen. Nothing happens to me when you are with me. Dad asked why you didn't complain to the police. There is no such need. I can control those thugs. I know who they are. - who are they? - I'll tell you later. Rajesh. Mother. - Hello, aunt. - bless you. - who is she? - Mom, she is Taruna. Daughter of Mr. Shyamlal. Shyamlal. - The toy maker? - Yes. Taruna, sit down. I will go now. I'll come back later. ok - Why did she come here, Rajesh? - To meet me. Mother Taruna is a very good girl. A group attacked my manager Mr. Rajesh. They tried to kill him. Rajesh is not only my manager but also a stranger in our village. It's a shame for us... ...that a guest was treated like that. The village court wants to know who did this and why? Mr. Rajesh who do you suspect? Who is your enemy? What could be the cause of hostility? Does your silence show that you don't know? - I can't say. - Why is that? It takes courage to accuse someone in the village court. - He can't say that. - Why is that? Because a dishonored man cannot accuse an honorable one. But it is happening. I apologize to the village court. I am also a resident of this village. Our honor is the honor of the village. Whoever tries to disrespect our village... - Gotta face the consequences, right? - Yes. it is good. What do you mean by that now? Mr. Thakur, you are not the only one… ...The whole village knows that Taruna is my girlfriend. And the girlfriend is the person who is going to be the wife. Can anyone tolerate someone else flirting with their wife? - Don't kill him? - Yes. Mr. Thakur, you tell him that you are a guest in this village. If asked about his relationship with Taruna? Mr. Contract, today the village court wants to know… ...only about who attacked me, not my personal matters. Your personal matters? Are you flirting with innocent village girls? How do you say that? Mr. Thakur, if I begin to tell his story. It will take a very long time. Suffice it to say that he has been rudely treated for evidence. Mr. Thakur tell him not to drag my daughter's name into it. - Are you the boss here? - Not someone else's... ...I am definitely Taruna's boyfriend and your son-in-law. - Shut up. - Father-in-law, why are you angry? If you don't like me, why did you allow this relationship? Aren't you ashamed to lie in the village court? I told you often... ...that this is a childhood friendship. But you are trying to force it. If you say so... ...I declare in front of everyone. I will marry Taruna. It is a matter of my honor. Is that right Mr. Thakur? I also declare this in front of everyone. I only like a young man… ...my daughter wants to get married. To fill her life with happiness and not sadness. I deal with Apple. I will not make her sad. Who doesn't want to make their wife happy! Shyamlal, being stubborn is not right. It's been years. You should marry Taruna to Bhagatram. It is something related to his honor and life. Mr. Thakur. Why don't you say I want to strangle my daughter? It is impossible. Do you not accept the decision of the village court? If you don't accept it, you have to leave the village. Mr. Thakur, I think your decision is right. We think so too. What kind of village court is this? This suppresses the truth and supports the lie. Mr. Thakur, Members of Rural Courts Hon. Do not hear what is said? - Yes. - It is wrong. Imagine if you were in Mr. Shyamlal's place. Do you respect them after this decision? no way. Mr. Thakur, don't give such a verdict. Losing faith in the village court. Mr. Thakur, your judgment is always in favor of truth. Come on, get up. I'm telling the truth. No, son. You should not say all that. Mr. Thakur felt very uncomfortable. Truth is always bitter to dishonest people. - What are you saying son? - I'm fine, mom. It is Mr. Thakur's decision and not the decision of the village court. For the sake of Meena's happiness, the youth is being treated unfairly. But I won't let that happen. Mr. Thakur's money can buy someone like Bhagatram, but I am not such a person. If my mother has to go, we will go too. We are not here. Please come in. Dad went out. I came to meet you. sit down Rajesh praises you a lot. He mentions you in every conversation. - I don't know that. - Why not, daughter? You know everything. Today I came to test your love. I am a very distressed woman. Enemies killed my husband. I became a widow at a very young age. Only a little boy was with me. Only God knows how I was. How I lived until now. And when life is about to get better... ...again questions arose. Daughter, I came to tell you this sad story. I didn't understand what you were saying. - Who killed your husband? - Thakur! - That's a lie. - that is true. - What do you want from me? - Need your help. You are not related to these in any way. However, I will tell you my secret that I have not revealed to anyone. Thakur's wealth and property... ...I also owned a part. My husband and Thakur were business partners. Thakur killed my husband for greed of property. Why didn't you arrest him? I had no evidence. So I couldn't do anything. Meanwhile, a son was born in Thakur's house. Thakur was hunting that night. His wife slipped and fell unconscious. So the baby was born before the due date. The midwife went to see the doctor. My maid taking advantage of the situation. Helped me move the babies. Here, lady. Thakur's son. Give your daughter and leave quickly. Give it to me, ma'am. Go quickly. Even if you do that... ...I brought up Thakur's son with much love. Just when I thought my problems were solved... ...you entered his life. - I am...? - Yes. your. I thought I would give Thakur's son back and get my daughter back. There was only one solution. It was Rajesh and Meena getting married. But now it is impossible. Rajesh loves you. Daughter, don't destroy my life-long efforts. I am begging you. For God's sake, don't. I will kill myself if Rajesh and Meena don't get married. And you are responsible for my death. For God's sake, shut up. Then promise me. You will never come into Rajesh's life again. You leave him forever. I promise. Please leave me like this now. go now daughter I am forever indebted to you. You cheered up a grieving mother. God will surely help you for that. Surely he will do so. Taruna, where are you going? - Near here. - Come on, I'll drop you off. Come on. I will go with Bhagatram. With Bhagatram...? Yes, with Bhagatram. Bhagatram, I looked for you. - I am...? - Yes. - Really? - Yes. - Let's go where you say. - I have a lot to talk about. Let's go somewhere else. People hear. OK, come on. Brother right? There you go! did you see He became jealous. Now tell me, where to go? I go to my house, you go to yours. got it? Always changing. What a strange girl. Taruna, why is this? what is that? You turned your back on me on the street... ...was happily chatting with Bhagatram. Did you hear the decision of the village court that day? Do you accept that decision? - It is a decision of the village court. - No, it was Mr. Thakur's decision. If so, we must certainly accept it. Mr. Thakur is a rich person. The whole village listens to him. Even we want to live in this village. - We cannot go against Mr. Thakur. - Taruna. Have you forgotten who Bhagatram is? - He's a thug. - Mr. Rajesh. I don't want to hear anything against him. - Please get out of here. - Taruna. What happened to you? Is the world changing so quickly? Bhagatram, the one who tried to disrespect you. - Discredited you. - I told you to go, didn't I? I will go. But tell me. What happened to the promises you made to me? Those promises are just a joke. We always joked with each other. First we did, then you and then we will. I didn't know you would take it seriously. The whole village knows that Bhagatram is my lover. We got engaged when we were young. There is nothing Mr. Thakur and the village court can do about it. That is the truth. Please don't take this any further. Don't ask anything else about it. And never come here again. Meena. We played with love for your entertainment. It's over now. This necklace is the symbol of my victory. But I don't deserve it. You deserve it. Keep it safe. I will always remember that... ...that he won even if he lost. And even if I win, I lose. Mr. Rajesh! Mr. Rajesh! Mr. Rajesh. She left this note and disappeared. "Father I'm sorry" "I'm Going Forever" "Tell Mr. Rajesh that I didn't cheat him." Come on. may be... According to this article, she may have committed suicide. No, Inspector. do not say that. My daughter cannot kill herself. She cannot leave her old father alone. do not be sad. We'll keep looking. If we get any information, we will let you know. Now you go. Meena. Why are you silent? Who gave you this necklace? Taruna, gave me this necklace. How do you feel about it? It's not worth it to her. You don't deserve it. Remove it. Rajesh, what's wrong with you? what are you saying? We are going to get married in a few days. I will not marry a girl who has lost her friend's love. Taruna, our friendship broke the day my love was taken away. - Your love? - Yes, my love. I had told Taruna not to come between us. But she didn't listen. If I were alive today, I would not forgive her. - Do you talk about forgiveness after sinning? - Rajesh. If anyone but you said this... And if there was someone else in your place... -...she would rather die than be decent. - Politeness? Yes, something Tarana had and you don't. Rajesh! You have no right to insult me. One is defamed by actions and intentions. It is very easy for someone to be like you, but very difficult to be like Taruna. No. why not? Why wasn't I allowed to die? Because you didn't let me live. Don't be so stubborn. In a little while, the priest will go and come with the pastor, and we will get married. Then neither you nor father nor society can take you away from me. Because you are legally my wife. got it? Gauri! - Okay! - Sit down. - You don't talk. - Brother! Gauri! Bhagatram's sister, be my bride. I am... what did you say - Nothing. - Why did you come here? - I came back. - Then go. I leave. OK! Did someone call me? No. go out OK! - Someone called me. - That's your illusion. - I don't have such a bug. - Go, get out. - Okay! - Okay! I hear two voices. One is Gauri, the other is younger sister Taruna. - Sister, are you alive? - Yes. - But now you are being killed. - Why kill me? Hariya somehow rescue Taruna from here. - I will call Rajesh. - Who will let you go? - Leave me alone or I'll hit you. - Hit me? you idiot. "Here we go round the mulberry bush" "Here we go round the mulberry bush" "Here we go round the mulberry bush" "Here we go round the mulberry bush" "Here we go in a circle" you idiot. Your carpet is very dusty. Dusty? - What did this do? - Wait. The Villain Downstairs and the Villain Upstairs. The other villain is white, this one is black. what are you doing - Take this scorpion. - A scorpion. - My God. - Help me. Oh, my God. - God, a scorpion! - Where is the priest? Didn't meet the priest, sir. Mr. Rajesh. - The sister is alive. - what? Yes. Bhagatram keeps her locked in his house. - Bhagatram. - You go there. I will inform Mr Thakur. Meena. Rajesh. - I want to tell you something. - Mina. No matter, Rajesh survived. Is there any use for such a large body? Go kill yourself. - You can't fight fate, sir. - Stop this nonsense. - Don't get angry. - Why hasn't the priest come yet? He will come soon. Why don't you say anything honey? Meena. What happened to Meena? Meena, my child. Who killed her? You killed my daughter. You are a murderer. I will kill you. I will not spare you, wretch. Do not touch me. You killed Meena. Meena's father, ie Shanti's husband. - what are you saying? - It's true. Mrs. Meena and Shanti know it. what is true You make excuses to run away. After knowing the truth you will run away, Mr. Thakur. - From you and your son. - Son? Yes. When you kill Mrs. Shanti's husband. That's a lie. that is true. Mr. Thakur, if you had the guts to commit that crime… -...be brave enough to hear this truth. - I did not commit any sin. You are a sinner and a murderer. When you kill Mrs. Shanti's husband. She transferred her daughter Meena. To take that revenge from your son. - It's impossible. - But it happened. Children are switched at birth. - Evidence...? - Mrs. Shanti. - Shanti? - Yes. That means Meena Shanti's daughter. Are you my son? - Rajesh. Is it true son? - I wish it wasn't so. son Not your son, I'm a murderer. Mr. Thakur, take me to the police. Don't be silly, my son. You cannot commit murder. If you've done it by mistake, don't tell anyone. I blame it on someone else. As long as this father is there, nothing can happen to the son. whose father what father Mr. Thakur. Look at her. You raised her. A while ago you screamed and cried. Because until then she is your daughter. But the sadness disappeared in a moment. You don't regret her death one bit now. Because now she is not yours but Shanti's daughter. Forget what happened son. Do you want me to forget your crimes? Did I grow up in someone else's house? Should I forget that my father was a murderer? For your wealth, should I forget it? Then Mrs. Shanti took away my happiness for hers, didn't she? Taruna, you are the one who separated me. Mr. Thakur, you are the one who committed all these crimes. This innocent girl was punished for that. You did everything for him. But she gave her life and mocked you. Tell me the truth, who killed her? Bhagatram and his companions. Bhagatram! - I will set you free. - No. - Why is that? - I'll stay here. You run away. - Why is that? - They always peek in. If they don't see me here. Come and see. Then we can be caught on the way. So be careful sister. My brother is a very bad man. I will inform brother Rajesh. I leave. Thakur. You killed my husband and daughter. Now I'm the only one left. Strangle me too. - Mother. - Strangle me too. No... no. I am not a mother. I am not a mother. I separated from my daughter. I took you away from your mother. I changed your life for Meena. Instead of God, I tried to do justice. Oh my God, take away my Meena. Brother Rajesh. - Taruna, save. - Where is she? At the Round House three miles from here. Come on. I will take you before that. Come on. - Leave her alone. - No. Leave her alone. Priest. - Sir. - keep away. right now Yes, that's me. One criminal killed another criminal and saved an innocent. Inspector, it is good that you have come. Mr. Thakur, you? Yes, I did the killing. arrest me Rajesh I am not worthy enough to apologize to you. I am a murderer. But I am also a father. right? - Rajesh! - father! - Rajesh! - father! - Rajesh! - father! Come, Mr. Thakur. May you be blessed. where are you going I do not know. What am I doing here? No mom. do not say that. Here, mother. Mr. Thakur has signed the documents. To you, your property has been returned. This property is not mine, it's yours. Who will take care of me now? I missed receiving my child's love. Mom, don't say that. Meena is no more. But there is your son. Rajesh! Mom, promise you will never leave us. Promise us. Mother! If you are free... ...we need help too. But it's okay if you can't. Let's bless each other! "Heartless Lovers" "I'm thinking about you" "Why did I do that?" Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
