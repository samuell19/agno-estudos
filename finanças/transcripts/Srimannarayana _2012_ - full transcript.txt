Before we begin with the story, let's talk about three people. He is Agriculture Minister Bail Reddy. He is so intelligent that he made people believe that to become an Agriculture Minister one doesn't need education. This is Pulikeshav Reddy, Bail Reddy's brother-in-law. He loves his brother-in-law. But more than that, he loves other people's land. On paper, he's just a builder. But unofficially, he's involved in all illegal businesses. This is Harshad Kotari. A famous broker in money laundering. He lives in Malaysia. But he is a genius in transferring black money from India to foreign countries and keeping it safe. He will kill the person who even thinks of betraying him. At present they have their eyes set on the 200 acres of land of the Jai Jawan Housing Society. The government gave this land to the soldiers who lost their hands and legs in a war. All they left them is the foundation stone and converted the land into Ujwala Township. You must be wondering why the law isn't doing anything about it. Well, it is. It is doing its duty. And if these guys come in the way of law, it will quietly step aside. Even the media is scared to expose their scam. But only two channels have started the investigation. I lost my hand in a war... and I lost my self-respect while fighting for the land that was given to me. Will we get our house if you show it on the breaking news? Forget it. I have obtained all the details of the Jai Jawan scam. We're breaking the news day after tomorrow. On our channel? -Why are you saying that, sir? -You will read the news with interest, but Sriman will work on it and show it more interestingly. Each time he'll telecast the breaking news on their channel it will be shocking news for us. This has become a routine now, but anyway, all the best. Thanks. Hello? There she is! Catch her, guys! Start the vehicle! Srimannarayana, take my shock. Sriman, Pulikeshav Reddy's goons are chasing me. I am in danger. Don't worry. Where are you? I don't know where I am. Disconnect the call. I will make a video call. Show me the surrounding area. -Naveena! Head down! -What? Head down! Head down! -Hello! -Leave the vehicle -and get inside any nearby colony. -Okay. Guys, come on! Turn right from there. Yes. -Take a left! Left! -Okay! Enter the Chanda Nagar railway station. The train will arrive at the platform in the next two minutes. Board it. Tell me. The channel girl fooled us and boarded a local train at Chanda Nagar. The next stop is the last one. Lingampalli. Catch her at any cost. How should I catch her? You haven't told me how she looks and what she is wearing? She is wearing a blue color jacket and is carrying a camera. Brother, here she is. The blue jacket girl. Where do you think you're going?! -They have come here, as well. -Let me go! Turn your mobile camera towards them. Do you think you can record anything because you have a camera? Remove your jacket and tie it around your waist. Hide the camera. -Come on. -Leave me. Hey, that's not her. She is there! Catch her! Sri, they've identified me. -Where is she? -Over there. What do you want me to do now? Enter the garage of SVR Travels. Yes. Who is it? Hey! How dare you mess with us? Do you know whose men you've knocked down? I don't need a bio-data to thrash anyone! There's no bravery in bringing us to your place and beating us up. If you have guts come to our place. Why do I need a place to beat idiotic rascals like you? I'll come wherever you want. Tell me, where should I come? Does 7 Road Centre, in Kadapa okay for you? Sapthagiri Circle in Ananthapur, Konda Reddy Buruju in Kurnool. Benz Circle in Vijayawada, Kashmir Katta in Karimnagar. If not that, how about Dhoolpet, your boss's hood? Is that okay? If I beat you then your brains will slip towards the heart, the heart would then slip onto the kidneys and the kidneys would slip onto your legs. There would be no confusion while saying anything. There is no compromise in thrashing. Did you find the girl? We did not find the girl, brother, but we got stuck with one. -Who is he? -Srimannarayana. Journalist. Don't shout! I hate sound pollution! Besides holding a pen, I also know how to use a gun. Hey, soldiers are the protectors of the country. And would you illegally occupy the land which they got? I won't spare you if I see you again. -Give the chip! -I won't. No, I won't give. Give the chip! -Swapnika, if Sri finds out about this... -What will he do? KOTILINGAM -Yes. -What did you say, sir? Breaking news for Srimannarayana and shocking news for us? -I have reversed it. -You expect me to believe that? -I have got the chip and I am coming. -Thank you. Hey, what is it? Why are you staring at me like that? What will you do? Will you use your force on me now? I will take it at any cost. -From here! Will you take it from here? -Any doubt? Mister! Mister! Help! -Somebody help me, please! -Me? Somebody help me, please... Do you need help? Don't act over-smart. First, you follow her, then if she doesn't accept, you'll attack her with liquid. It's not liquid, it's acid, brother. Do you think nobody will question you? -What's the problem, baby? -Brother. -Shall I thrash him with a rod or chains? -There is no time, dear. Thanks, brother. Teach him a lesson. Your brother isn't needed for this. Leave it to me. She called you "brother". -Did you hear correctly? -Yes. -Did you call me brother? -Yeah! Save your sister and come. -You... -Brother-in-law, do what you want with my sister, I am leaving. -Why did you involve me in this? -What the hell! What? Do you think I'll get scared? If I file a case under harassment they will keep you in jail for three years. Then file a case. Who will you speak to? Make a call. What? Don't you know the number? Fine, should I give you the number? 9998999989. Listen, that place will retain its value if you give the chip to me. Hey, I won't spare you if you come closer. I'll kill you! Is it?

I have arranged high security for you and our channel. Give the chip. Breaking news is about to begin. Sir, the breaking news is airing. How is it possible when the chip is with her? Silly girl! Sir, the breaking news is airing, but it isn't on our channel. The Jai Jawan housing society scam is creating a sensation in the state. It has been alleged that along with Agriculture Minister Bail Reddy... there are many others involved in it. The opposition party and the ministers are demanding Bail Reddy's resignation. As the situation is changing radically... Sorry, sir, I hid the chip in a place where no one could find it, but Srimannarayana still took it. Sir, the ACP's calling. -Kotilingam. -This is ACP Ramaswami. You asked me for police protection. How many people do you need? No need. I just compromised with Bail Reddy and Pulikeshav Reddy. Sir, we've canceled all the programs. What shall we telecast now? Death is a must for the one who is born and birth is a must for the one who is dead. Therefore, in the unavoidable discharge of your duty, you should not lament. Make a telecast that Kotilingam, the CEO of Channel 6... has died and start with Bhagavad Gita by Mr. Ghantasala... and a solo violin as its continuation. I am increasing your salary by Rs. 10,000 from next month. For you to keep quiet without doing any work. As you were a highly recommended candidate, right? Srimannarayana, the journalist for Zee 24 Hours, has exposed the Jai Jawan Housing Society scam. EXPOSED THE SCAM ZEE 24 HOURS JOURNALIST In the Jai Jawan Housing Society scam, Zee 24 Hours exposed that... along with the state Agriculture Minister Bail Reddy, his brother-in-law Pulikeshav Reddy, and famous money broker Harshad Kotari, are all involved in this. Due to this, Government has ordered... to return that land to the housing society. Minister Bail Reddy has been removed from the ministry. Will he kill me if I come in front of him? You were quiet when he was threatening me on the phone? Scoundrel, why did not gun him down at once? They have handed over the entire Ujwala township to the military people. How dare you stare at me even after you're dead? I am already dying of tension. Don't I have the right to be angry? We have been trapped by Srimannarayana. Stay calm! Harshad's calling. -Yes, Harshad? -Is Pulikeshav Reddy angry? Don't you know he is very short-tempered? I asked him to yell and then kill, but now he is yelling at a dead body. -Give the phone to him. -Here, take it. Harshad wants to talk to you. Talk to him! Harshad, I won't spare him. -I will kill him within 24 hours. -Don't act in haste, Pulikeshav Reddy. He does not look like an ordinary man. Neither we can beat him nor catch him with a map. We can't even kill him by planning a sketch. We need to conduct research on him in order to kill him and we need time, understood? Here, research, my foot! We are going through a rough patch, man! Bring the priest. Quickly bring the priest! Where are you guys going? Sir, did you call us? I didn't, I just murmured. -What happened, sir? -I lost my ministry... I lost my property and I lost my money. Conduct some special veneration. After the veneration, if I still don't get my post within a week, I will kill both of you, arrange a funeral and make the rats eat it. We came here long back to perform a funeral. But since then he's making us conduct our funeral rites. -Priest. -Yes. For five years... the crows haven't touched the funeral offerings for my father. -Crows don't come to a sinner's house. -What did you say? Actually, like us, the crows are also scared of you. I don't care what you do, I just want the crows to eat the feast. I want to get rid of the bad omen. Crows, Please come! Please, stop it, sir. -Priest, you call the crows. -Okay. -Come... -No! No! Eat the food. Come on... What to do now? Don't be tense! I guess they don't know Hindi. I will call them. We are doomed! And my priest... Chicken? Sir, close your eyes and pray for your father's soul to rest in peace. Only open them when I tell you to. You don't need to close. What man, you have put a cherry in the food? It's a chicken piece, priest. -It is a grave sin. -To hell with the sin. -It is a grave sin. -Come! Open your eyes. Crows are coming. Did you see the miracle of the chicken? Priest, listen. We called for crows but why did an eagle come and take the feast? Isn't that more suited to your status? Whatever it is, for five long years... the crows haven't eaten the food kept for my father's soul to rest in peace, that is why I became thin. -Listen! -Yes? -Give them 10,000 rupees, instead of 1116. -Wow. -Take your money and go. -Come on, kids. -Brother-in-law. -Yes. Crows were not even touching the food for the last five years. But today is an auspicious day as the food was eaten by an eagle. Brother-in-law, this year you will definitely win the elections. Priest, how deeply are you in debt? -I have 20,000 in debt. -Me, too. If we want to save some money after repaying our debts... -then I have a plan for it. -What plan? -Come, I'll it discuss with those idiots. -Let's go. Mr. Bail Reddy, the election results will be declared in two days. If you have my priest conduct special veneration... then you will definitely win. Veneration for winning? -I never heard... -Even I didn't. -It's not true, that's why! -Okay, then conduct it. -But it will cost Rs.50,000. -Forget the 50,000, we will pay one lakh. I must win. You make the necessary arrangements. Sir, we have successfully finished the veneration. What about our fees... Hey, give me the money. -We will meet you after the results. -Sure. Sure. Then we will again conduct a special veneration for you to become the CM. Stop, priest. I think he is going to give us a tip. You can go home only after my brother-in-law wins the elections. -If he loses, I'll kill you. I guess he thinks that we are lucky for him. He has trapped us over here. Don't worry. I have a great idea to get out of here. Shut up or else I'll bash you. What have you done, son? Bail Reddy and Pulikeshav Reddy got frightened and gave our land back. Until yesterday, they had only heard about Sriman, today, they got to meet you. I am very happy that you work for our channel. Can I say one more thing? I am very proud that you're the son of Padma Shri Kailash Narayan Murthi. -Padma Shri? -I just received the news from INPS. Your father's name is included in this year's Padma Shri awards. It will be officially announced in the evening. Thank you, sir. -I should go immediately. -Where? I want to share the good news with my father. Okay, go ahead. What is this, dear? What are the arrangements for? Father, I have no idea. Go and ask Sriman. I have a lot of work. Hey, Gopi! At least you tell me. What is going on in this house? Sir, please wait. I am already worried. -Why are you worried? -Lord Krishna... narrated Bhagwat Geeta only before Arjuna, right? Then how did the entire world learn about it? Did piracy exist even in those days? Idiot! You and your stupid doubts! -Sriman! -Father. Wear these new clothes. What's the occasion? What are these arrangements for? I will tell you. First, wear these new clothes. -I am already wearing them, ain't I? -Hurry, go and change them quickly. Oh, no! Hey! Will you tell me? It's not your birthday or my birthday. -What is all this? -Today is a big day. -You are... -Mother! If you wait for two more minutes, he will tell you. Sriman, it's time. Turn on the TV. NEWS 24 HOURS Mr. Kailash Narayana Murthy is the main headline for our channel today. Mr. Narayana Murthy was born into a landlord family in the Mahboob Nagar district. He fought for the rights of the farmers and became their leader. He sold his properties and built cold storages, borewells, and Market yards. He brought greenery to all the surrounding villages. Gandhi said that farmers are the backbone of this country. And Mr. Narayana Murthy stood as a backbone for the farmers. The Government that addressed his work and appreciated him is now honoring him with a Padma Shri Award. Son, I am not that happy to receive the Padma Shri award. If every farmer stays happy, that is the real happiness for me. Yes, I know. You feel happy when farmers make progress and he feels happy when he fights against injustice. What, Mother, why are you changing the topic? I did not sleep for the last two days after seeing your matter on TV. Quit the job that puts your life at stake. I am worried sick. Auntie, fix his marriage, it will end your worries. He will be after my uncle wearing a loincloth and after me, holding my scarf. Brother, what are your thoughts on marriage? What's there to think about? If he says yes, I will get him engaged right away. What's the hurry for an engagement? We should find a girl, right? -Bhanu. -Yes, dear?

Only cold drinks? -Don't you have alcohol? -That is what's in it. Oh! Sriman, do you remember our Goa trip? -It was so much fun. -No, No. Even my husband should know what actually happened in Goa. I should know first. Say it. What will you do after knowing about it? I will tell you. We all went to Goa. It was a college trip. Girls and boys. We partied all night in Baina Beach. At that party, Sri was done after five beers. What should I do... -I had five beers? -He was out of his senses. Later we didn't even know who went to which room. I woke up at midnight and I went to look for her. But she was not in her room. Then I opened everyone's door to see where she is. -Do you know where she was? -Listen... At his door... -When I asked, they said nothing happened. -Trust me, nothing happened between us. I don't think he did anything. Do you think it was a development program to explain everything? What must have he done after drinking five beers? There is only one way to clear your doubt. Make him drink five beers. He will then do the same thing that he did in Goa. Go and bring five beers immediately. Come, sit down. What is all this, what are these beers for? Have it. It's our engagement treat. You must have drank sometime in Goa, right? She leaked the question paper, now he will be comfortable. Drink. Why should I say no to you? Okay, I'll drink. The expression changed in a single beer? No, don't look at me like that. Drink the third beer. I couldn't control myself seeing your measurements that day. Rascal! Look at how he is staring at me. -Come on. -I only showed him my measurements, she must have shown him everything. What are you thinking about? -Come on! -No, please. We'll do this after marriage. To hell with marriage. I'll do it when I am in the mood. You get ready. He has already lost control, He must have crossed his limits in Goa. When the vehicle is in top gear, I won't think about breaking it. I'll just crash it. Oh, no, will he rape me or what? What are you doing? I won't say it, I'll do it. Dear! This is wrong. No, it is wrong. -It should happen, that's it! -No. Romance and marriage are two different things. -My darling Bhanu... -No! -Sriman. -Bhanu. Please Sriman, don't do anything. No... Sriman? -Safe! -He fell asleep after having five beers... so nothing must have happened in Goa that day. Yes! JAI KISAAN ANNADATHA RELIEF FUND Greetings to everyone present here. First, I would like to invite our honorable Agriculture Minister, Mr. Janardhan to come to the stage! I would like to welcome the IG, Mr. Marthand! ANNADATHA RELIEF FUND I would also like to welcome Premier Bank's General Manager, Mr. Rajan Mudhal Iyer. Dr. Srikar Prasad, please come. I am very happy that we all have gathered here. This meeting should become the beginning of a great program. A farmer toils hard and provides food to everyone, but migrates to cities and earns little money as a daily wage laborer to find food for himself. By defying the fate that was written by God, he is mixing pesticide... with food and committing suicide by consuming it. My heart breaks to see this. I have helped in any way I could. We have a lot to do. I have scheduled the plan and submitted it to the Government. Since they couldn't allocate funds for it, they felicitated me with the Padma Shri award. We donate a lot of money to temples every day. Thousands of rupees in a donation box. Can't we give even 100 rupees to our farmers? If lakhs of people donate money, crores of rupees can be collected and that's enough for the farmers. I request each one of you, I am asking everyone here to join hands with me... and grant your full support to the Jai Kisaan scheme. With your support, make them powerful. Sir, I wish to donate Rs. 500 for your Jai Kisaan scheme. I am donating rupees 10,000 as my contribution to your trust all the good work that you're doing. -Greetings. -One minute. Greetings to all! On behalf of Premier Bank, I promise to provide... a loan worth rupees five lakhs to every farmer without any interest. Accept a check of rupees one lakh from me. And I will provide free medical treatment... to the poor farmers and their families in my hospital. Thank you very much. Mr. Kalki Narayana Murthy, I will help your trust... as much as I can on behalf of the government. All the people in this house are good actors. In the end, they treat me like a statue! No one listens to me. Forget about you, they don't even listen to me. Why would they listen to you? Get lost! Go! My husband and my son don't obey me. -What happened, Auntie? -You are like this! Look, I forgot to pour oil into it. I have told him several times, that you are engaged now, quit that job and help your father in his business. But he doesn't listen to me. I am afraid to sit in front of the TV. -Mother-in-law. -What? I grant you my full support in this matter. Continue with the same aggression and teach him a lesson. Either he should stay in this house or me. Hey, Srimannarayana! Come out! What is this, Auntie? Your aggression has shifted on to uncle? Yeah! -What is it, Father? -Tell me! Either you stay in the house or I will. -Even your dialogue has shifted. -Yes. -Will you quit your job or not? -But why, Father? I asked you to work in a channel... and you start fighting with every Tom-Dick and Harry? -It's not like that father... -Shut up! Quit your job right now and stay at home. Don't step into this house if you don't agree. What's wrong with you? How can you yell at your grown-up son? Tell your son to quit the job. You gave away all your wealth to the farmers... and you didn't even leave a single penny for your son. -Now you want him to quit, as well? -Shut up! I swear on myself if he goes to work... I swear on myself if he quits the job... He will be getting married now. Is this the way you behave with your son? What does he think of himself? By the way, what were you expecting? I am expecting him to not go to work. -Then, what happened now? -What happened? -Oh, no! -Silly! Cook dosa now. You scared me, Father. Hey, if you want your mother to not talk about your job, I should show off like this. You are very smart, Father. Son, I am helping very few people with what I have. That is not greatness. You are stopping people from suffering from injustice. That is greatness. Usually, the son demands a father's wealth as an inheritance. But you asked for my dream. I am proud of you, my son. -Okay, you may go now. -Okay, Father.

I just dropped you home, why are you here again? -Let's talk inside, move. -Hey! Hey! Goons were roaming around my house. I was scared. So, I came here. -For security. -What kind of nuisance is this?

I don't have stupid sentiments like that. You marry her and keep me with you. We will have a live-in relationship. -What? -Don't you understand? You keep her sound on, I will be on mute. Stay within your limits. Who has come so early in the morning? What are you doing here? -Hi! -Hi! -Who is she, dual sim? -What do you mean? She is paying money to the auto driver. If she sees her, you will be finished. You are going to kill me. My cousin has come. Is my competitor here? No problem. Let's clear the air. She is coming, ask her to keep quiet. -Oh, no! What are you doing? -Roll her. Roll her. Cover her up. She has just begun but this one is already on the bed. -Hi, cousin. -What brings you here all of a sudden? I wanted to see you so I came. Is this a bad time? By the way, why do you look irritated, so early in the morning? She got hurt. Why don't you call and come? I tried to call, but your phone was busy. -Why don't you take another sim? -It's already there. -He already has another one? -Yes. Why haven't you given me the number? Actually, it is yet to be activated. Very fancy number. -Thank you. -Thanks. We are going to get married soon, and you still haven't got me a gift? You thought I didn't plan anything? Wow! S means Sriman. -It's very nice. -Swapnika. You always want to be close to my heart, right? Yes, that's right. I wanted to gift this to you as a surprise on our wedding day. I think you are tired. Go and freshen up, we will go out for shopping. Thank you. -Thank God! -Hello. -She might die because she can't breathe. -Wait, man. -Can you move? -Oh! I forgot about her. -Oh, no! Please, move. -Hey, take this and leave. Hey, I gave you a gift and you used it to impress your cousin. -Then what gift will you give me? -I'll give you something or the other, go. -Promise? -Promise. Will you build the Taj Mahal for me? I will. I purchased two acres of land recently. I am waiting for you to die. I will start the construction then. -Go from here, first. -Hey, Sri! Your name should have been Sri Krishna. Oh, my! Take it. Wow! You are wearing the clothes that our son brought. You never start any work without him. You know my sentiments, right? My son is my luck. -Greetings, sir! -Greetings to all of you. Sir, we are very happy. Until now farmers felt happy only during the harvest season... but hereafter, every farmer will be happy every day. We will start the Jai Kisaan program activities tomorrow. -I will go to the bank. -Okay, sir. -I'll be back. -Okay sir. -Yes, Father. -I will reach the bank in an hour. -Come fast. -Okay, Father. -I will reach on time. -Okay. -Bhanu. -Yes? We should leave in an hour. Hurry up. -In an hour? -Come on. Idiot! -Sorry. -Thanks. I said sorry for ramming into you. I thank you for it. That boy rammed into her, and she yelled at him! But when you rammed into her, she says thanks?! Let's go. I wonder what is happening. -Every girl is falling for you. -Bhanu, this dress will look good on you. Try it. I am going to the trial room. If you dare to even look at any girl, I will kill you. Leave me! Sriman! Sriman! Who are you? -Sriman! -Bhanu! Sriman! Sorry! Greetings, Murthy sir. Please sit down. Murthy sir, I am very happy that the Jai Kisaan account has been opened in our bank. We are so proud. -Even you were a part of it. -It's all by God's grace! One minute. Your checkbook and password are inside this envelope. You may check your account in that system. Who are you waiting for, sir? My son will be here soon. Your son must be busy. Send him a message. Where are you, son? Come soon. WHERE ARE YOU SON COME SOON Driver, go faster! Mr. Narayana Murthy? Mr. Narayana Murthy? Mr. Narayana Murthy? Hey! Anybody here? Security! Call the ambulance! Hey! -Sir! -Tell me? Car number AP-36N-111 broke the signal. There was an accident, sir. Which route is he headed to? Yes? What? -Doctor. -I am so sorry. He is no more. Mother. -Hey! Stop! -Stop! Hey. Come on, move! Fast! -Hello? -Sir, Mr. Srimannarayana is smashing the barricades and driving off. -Which route is he headed to? -He crossed the Shamshabad flyover. He is probably headed toward the airport, sir. What is going wrong? Come on! Stop him! Bring him to the hospital immediately. His father passed away. How did it happen? Sir, ever since he came to the bank he looked worried. I gave him an envelope containing the checkbook and password. Oh, yes... He was also constantly calling his son. And he looked quite worried. He then sat before the computer for net banking. He sat there for a long time. When I went to see him after some time... Lord Narayan! He was lying dead. And his balance... came down to rupees 5,000 from 5,000 crores. He was left only with Rs. 5,000 in place of Rs. 5,000 crores? What did he say to his son during his final hours? His son was not answering the phone. And he got even more stressed. I think after seeing a balance of only 5000 rupees, he must have suffered from a heart attack. Mr. Srimannarayana, an accident took place when you didn't stop while we were trying to stop you. -Somebody has kidnapped my cousin. -Where? At the shopping mall, in this vehicle. There is nobody in the vehicle. Even I am confused. -Constables! Search the vehicle! -Sir? Is your phone switched off? I think I left my phone somewhere. Sir, I found this bag, cell phone, and this cover when I was checking his vehicle. -Is that your phone? -Yes, sir. What is this, Srimannarayana? Sir... Sir, when I questioned him about his rash driving, he said his cousin got kidnapped. When I questioned him about his phone, he said he left it somewhere, sir. But when we searched his vehicle, we found his passport, mobile and air tickets to Switzerland, sir. His father died, and five thousand crores are missing from the account. And Srimannarayana is at the airport with air tickets to Switzerland. -Take him into custody. -Yes, sir. We are arresting you. But before that, you must come to the hospital. -Hospital? -Your father's no more. Usually, the son demands the father's wealth... but you asked for my dream. I am proud of you, my son. Where are you, son? Come soon. Where are you, son? Come soon. I am responsible for your death, Father. After hearing the arguments... the accused Srimannarayana is guilty. This is the verdict of the court. For further investigation of the Jai Kisaan Rs. 5,000 crores scam... the court orders the government... to hand over this case to the CBI. You brought disgrace to the journalists. You brought disgrace to the journalists. You used to expose scams, and now you are involved in one. Tell me. You used to expose scams, and now you are involved in one. Tell me. If you ask a thief, why he did it, what will he even say? Ask us, and we will tell you. If you ask a thief, why he did it... We trusted your father and donated our hard-earned money. And you cheated us! Damn it! And you cheated us! Damn it! CHERLAPALLY CENTRAL JAIL Yes, it will be done. How can we let him go?! After all, he is your man and he has murdered someone? We will take proper care of him. Hey, even you have to take care of us then, okay? Complete the formalities -and put him in cell number 130. -Yes, sir. Where are you, son? Come soon. Come soon. Come soon. Your family is here to meet you. Son. What is all this? Whom have we cheated? Why did this happen to us? We are trying for bail, Sriman. But they are saying that it's difficult to get bail. The people who always praised us are now abusing us. I am feeling very sad, Son. Don't feel sad, Mother. Not for the people who bowed before my father. But for the people who pointed fingers at my father. I will find out the truth. Bhanu, look after mother. Swapnika, it's a conspiracy to frame me. There must be a big network behind this. Listen carefully, what you have to do is... -I will do that. -Take care. Sit down. I am Gyaneshwar from CBI. Let us come to the point. Where have you hidden the 5,000 crores? In a Swiss bank? Which you can rob silently. But I am not going to spare you if you remain silent. -Where did you hide the money? -Ask the people who stole it. Then why did the cops catch you red-handed and put you behind bars? Ask the people who have dragged me into this. -You are trying to act smart. -No! I am telling you the truth. Your father talked to you for the last time before he died. After you got the password, you switched your phone off, and then you slyly transferred the money -into your account. -No! A lie will not become the truth if you raise your voice. CBI! I will perform a Narco test if required to make you confess the truth. What will you make me confess? The 2009 Satyam scam. Hundreds of inquiries and thousands of charge sheets. The public faced a loss worth rupees 7,000 crores. That is your system? The 2010, 2G spectrum scam. Same to same! Rupees 175,000 crores of loss to the public. This is what your system is! You were happy that you caught the criminals, but the people were doomed. Forget all that! The Jai Jawan scam. You have been conducting inquiries for three years. And within three days of enquiring around, I exposed the scam and helped the military people get their land back. I caught the scammers without the CBI's help... and made the public applaud me. That is my system! CBI. You work under the government... and we are the people who question the government about the work. Sriman, you are crossing your limits. Now you've started the investigation from outside. But I have already started my investigation from inside. So, don't trouble the trouble! If you trouble the trouble, trouble troubles you... I am not the trouble! I am the truth! Mr. Rajan Mudhal Iyer, Rs. 5,000 crores are missing from your bank. That spoils your bank's reputation, right? What can I do about that? Do you want me to transfer to Chennai or what? If you cooperate, then we will investigate on behalf of Channel 6. CBI is already doing it. It is under process, you know? We will find the truth before them. Your channel is Channel 6, next comes seven... after that eight, nine and ten. No need. You will ask me something, and in response, I will say something... and then, you will create something out of nothing and show it as the truth. I don't want to get tense because of it. Your channel people are very dangerous. Even if we just raise our hand in anger, that's it! You will show it on repeat that I have slapped you. And with that, we are done for. So we better remain quiet. The interview is over. You may leave now. We have already approached the cyber crime department... to find out how the 5,000 crores were transferred. We will also get the IP address and transaction details. Mr. Mudhal Iyer, you'll see the breaking news soon. Goodbye. Listen carefully. Since morning, journalists, police, and TV reporters have all been coming in for various inquiries. A channel girl came in, talking about cybercrime and IP address, I am stressed. Please, do something. The matter has escalated. All six of us should meet in the evening. It's urgent! -I forgot my phone. -Okay, no problem. Sriman, your idea has worked. But the shocking thing is that not just the bank manager, but there are five more people involved in this. Hearing about a channel girl talking about cybercrime and IP address, I am stressed. The matter has escalated. All six of us should meet in the evening. It's urgent! -Should I broadcast this as breaking news? -No... It will alert the remaining five. Swapnika, you have done a good job. Who are you? You should be in jail... The matter has escalated. All six of us should meet in the evening. It's urgent! Don't do anything to me, sorry! Do you think a sorry will cover a 5,000 crore scam? Who are the remaining five? Bail Reddy. Pulikeshav Reddy Harshad Kotari. IG Marthand. Dr. Srikar Prasad. What did you do with the money? Tell me! Finish! Hey! This is our vengeance for what your son did to us. Because of him, I lost my ministry, and my self-respect. I lost crores of money. I lost everything except for my life! Thanks, man. The gift you are giving to us is of rupees 5,000 crores and our return gift to your son is your dead body. If your son stays alive then he will not let us live. That is why we have made arrangements to send him to jail. If you are alive even after knowing about this scam... the people who are with you won't spare us. That is why... we are going to kill you. Five thousand crores! -How wonderful! -Yes! 5,000 crores! -I am the next Chief Minister! -Then what are you waiting for? Let's transfer our shares to our accounts. -Correct. -Hello! -Each of us will get 830 crores. -Yes. If the Income Tax department notices that much amount in our account, forget about becoming a CM, and we will land up in Chanchalguda jail. I have already planned this. -Salim! -Sir? Hack it. Okay, sir. Yes! Sir, the work is done! Well done. I am sending a nice gift to you. Thank you, sir. Five thousand crores are for us. The minimum balance in this account is 5,000 rupees and it's for him. Mr. Narayana, bad luck! Everyone fights when it comes to money-related matters. Therefore the six of us will create a new password. Everyone, go and type one letter and keep that letter a secret. The account will not open until all of us meet. After all the problems are resolved, we will get our money back through Harshad in Hawala. We will then share it equally. Our account is safe. -IG! -Yeah? You take care of his son, -Dr. Rajan will take care of his father. -Okay. Let's go. You did not just kill my father... but you also killed the lives of lakhs of farmers. Hey! To be happy every farmer saved every last penny. -Don't kill me! -Tell me your password! K! K! You would've fallen into God's account if had died because of a health issue. But since you were involved in corruption, you will die in my account! -Hey! -No! Hey, you are one centimeter away from death. I am one kilometer away from sentiments. No hearing! Only killing! Who must have killed Rajan? Who else, that Srimannarayana! How can he kill when he is in jail? What if he has escaped? What if it was him, did he find out the password? Don't talk about that password topic, we will know everything within five minutes. -Tell me, Harshad? -I am worried sick. How long should I wait? -Did you get any information? -No, everything is confusing! Cut the call. I will call you later. Srimannarayana is in jail, sir. Is he in jail? Okay. It seems that he is in jail. He is in jail? SI, why are you walking like that? Did someone blow up a bomb again? Sniffer dogs stopped near the central jail. IG, my doubt has come true. It is Sriman! -Ravindra. -Sir? -Tell the jailer to come immediately. -Okay, Sir. He is inside the jail... and Rajan is dead. -Something's fishy. -Forget all this. Did you find out whether Rajan told his password to his wife? I went to his house yesterday. I thought it isn't in good taste to ask about it immediately after his death. So, I came back. One minute. -Hello. -Sister, It's Bail Reddy. -Tell me, Brother. -I was heartbroken... when I heard about his death. Knowing that one of us isn't alive, -I feel very sad. -Yes, brother. Mother asked me to come home so we are moving to Chennai. Sister, did Rajan tell you about any password related to the bank account. Yes, brother. He also told me about the share that we should receive. You will surely get the share. What did he tell you? What's the password? -Brother, he said it's K. -Okay, Sister. Okay, brother. -K. -K! K! Hey, Harshad. Rajan's wife told us his password. Wow! You gave a good news, brother. I'll leave for India right now. Good morning, sir. -What is this, Jailer? -Sir? It seems that the sniffer dogs came and stopped at the jail. What are you trying to say, sir? The killer must be in your jail, right? Sir, get straight to the point. Srimannarayana. There is no chance that he can come out of jail. Maybe when you slept after boozing... he must have given money to the guards and left without your knowledge. It is highly impossible, sir. Why do we need to discuss this when we already have a doubt? Why should I take the risk because of you? What? You are only giving me one lakh for a 5,000 crores scam? Tell me, right now. Done. All six of us should meet in the evening. It's urgent! The killer is very intelligent. He is trying to tell us that five more people are involved in this scam. That's why he left his phone there. -Hello. -Hey, Jailer. Are you trying to act over-smart? You said bundles are not sufficient and therefore you took a suitcase. Tell me, are you doing the work or not? The game starts in a few minutes. I will let you know once it is finished. Okay! Okay! Hey! Hey! Ambulance! Brother-in-law, he is dead! -He is dead! -What are you saying? -Really? -Yes, brother-in-law. Have sweets. I am very happy today. Hey, distribute sweets to everyone. No! No! -Throw a party. -That's it. Bail Reddy looks very happy. This is the time for us to escape. Bail Reddy, sir. Yes, priests? We are very happy today. Ask what you want. Sir, it has been many days since we met our wives. -If you permit us... -Oh, Is that so? Hey, give 50,000 rupees to priests and send them home. -Go, Go. -Wonderful. Hey, don't open your mouth until we exit the gate. -What are you whispering? -Even I didn't hear it. One more thing. Don't stay with your wife for long. -Return immediately. -Okay. Take the money. Oh, thanks. -Hey, cover this money. -Yes. The puja plate is ready. The lamp extinguished! -I hope my husband does not die. -Silly woman! The lamp extinguished! -Oh, God. -Damn it! Oh no! -I think I will die. -Oh, God. Hey, I think he might be alive. Call the jailer. Call him. You stop crying and shut your mouth! Shut up! Brother-in-law, the jailer is on call. What jailer, -he is still alive, right? -Yes, sir. Damn it! Hell with you! What bullshit are you talking man?! You said that you will kill him and whatnot! Just missed. Srimannarayana is in the hospital. The security is tight. It will be good if he dies naturally. Otherwise, I will kill him. Hey, if you don't kill him, I will kill you! What is this bad omen?! -Where are the priests? -Oh my god! Hey! Priests are going to meet their wives! Bring them! I did nothing, sir, he only extinguished the lamp. He only extinguished the lamp. Stupid priests! I am dying here. Where do you think you're going? Hey, perform a special prayer so that I don't die. -He will do it nicely. -Yeah, right! I'll only do it! You idiot! Harshad, good, you're here. Come, sit. Where is Dr. Srikar Prasad? Whatever hatred my heart has gone through... Hello? Dr. Srikar Prasad hasn't been to the hospital for the last three days. Though he has many guest houses... he is staying at the IG's guest house. That too, amidst private security. Hello! Srimannarayana? Hey, security! -Security! -Don't shout! If you shout then you will die in half a minute! If you stay quiet then you will live for at least five minutes. Hey! You are a doctor! What do you hear when you place the stethoscope on the heart? -Heartbeat. -Not heartbeat, man! You only hear money. My father heard about the burden of loans... in the hearts of lakhs of farmers. He collected 5,000 crores for them. It's not the wealth that makes an honest person work, it's the people. And you steal thousands of crores of public money as if it was your own money? -Tell me the password! -You will shoot me if I tell you. -What If I don't shoot you? -Then I will tell you... -Tell me! -Number nine. Dr. SRIKAR PRASAD. -You are lying! -No, I am telling you the truth! I will tell you. Number four. You said that you won't shoot me if I tell you the truth. Is Srimannarayana dead? No, sir. Dr. Srikar Prasad is dead. Hey! Rascal! You took lakhs from us. We told you to kill Srimannarayana but you are telling us that he killed our man. I know that Sriman has killed him! Hey, the brakes of the lorry carrying gas cylinders failed and it ran into a guest house and crashed into the solar fencing. He died because of the explosion of 100 gas cylinders. Are you saying that the person lying in the hospital has killed him? If you want, I'll return your money. You couldn't kill him even after the authority as a cop? You could not provide security to Rajan and Srikar. When is he getting discharged from the hospital? Tomorrow. First, you think of our safety. If you want to find out about Sriman's network... then fix CCTV cameras all over the cell. Breaks failed of a lorry carrying gas cylinders at midnight and it lost its control and ran into IG Marthand's guest house which was nearby. In this accident, the famous doctor, Srikar Prasad, lost his life. -Raghavendra. -Sir. -The killer called me some time back. -Sir. He asked me why Dr. Srikar Prasad was staying -in the IG's guest house. -Sir. After listening to him, I feel, IG could be his next target. -Sir. -We have to be alert. Let's move. If everything had happened as per the plan you would've been married to your cousin. The date might change but no one can stop you from marrying him. Shall we both become one And play 20-20 matches? Shall we both become one And do hot romance? The pitch is great baby And it is surely for a sixer Oh, my! My beauty is my property Loot it with your sight Oh, my!

Shall we both become one And do hot romance? Good morning, Mr. Markand. Oh, Mr. Gyaneshwar. Good morning. -Sit down. -Thank you. Mr. Marthand, how do you know Dr. Srikar Prasad? -We are friends. -Since when? I met him a year back in a club. Why was he staying in your guest house for the last three days? He said that his life was in danger. -From whom? -I don't know. -Why didn't you arrange for security? -He said he didn't require any. Then why did he appoint private security? -I don't know. -How come you didn't know that he arranged for private security while he was staying in your guest house? I didn't ask him as I was busy with my work. Didn't you notice security outside when you visited the guest house yesterday? I didn't go, I was in the club. Yesterday was Gandhi Jayanti. I think the club was closed, right? Are Dr. Srikar Prasad and bank GM Rajan Mudhal Iyer good friends? -I don't know. -You and Rajan Mudhal Iyer... -I don't know him. -Okay, then. Siri. Have a look. See you soon, okay? -Tell me, IG. -CBI Gyaneshwer came to my office. He made me sweat. He might come to interrogate you, as well. Be careful. Okay, I will take care of it. Dear. I showed your horoscope to the priest. He said that this is a bad time for you. He said that it would be good if we conduct special... prayers at Lord Lakshmi Narasimha temple. As you wish. Hey, open the door. Hey, what is this? Hey! Where did you get this phone from? Who gave it to you? Let me also see who is helping you in jail and what all you are executing with help from outside! Come on! I know how to make you tell the truth. You're acting very smart. Tell me! Who gave you a cell phone inside the jail? Tell me! It's sub-jailer Ram, right? Why are you staring at me like that? What are you staring at? Even if you stay mum I know how to make you speak up! I know it very well. You are connected to the murders, right? If you don't speak up, I know how to get it out of you in my style. Yes, sir. I am coming. Sir, the IG just left for the temple from his house. Okay. Follow him. Sir! Everything is clear, sir. Tighten the security. Don't allow anyone -until the prayer finishes. -Yes, sir. -Lock the temple's main door. -Okay, sir. -Careful, careful. -Yes, sir. Sir, pay obeisance to Lord Narasimha. Who are you? Srimannarayana?! You were in jail. How did you come here? Lord Narasimha broke the pillar... and removed the intestines from Hiranyakashyap's stomach! He was Lord Narasimha! I will break your brain and take out the password from it. -Srimannarayana will do it! -Sriman! No! No! Look, I am the IG. Security is tight outside. You cannot escape after killing me. I entered inside despite the tight security outside. Do you think, killing you and leaving is a small thing? Hey! Do you think I am Abhimanyu for getting trapped in Padmavyuha? Srimannarayana! Tell me the password! Please! Don't kill me. I will tell you the password. My Password is I. Now, leave me. Let me go. -If you say so, I'll let go of you. -Please. Hello. -Sir, someone has brutally killed the IG. -What? Another shocking piece of news is those visuals from Srimannarayana's cell were found in the IG's laptop. -Sriman's visuals in IG's laptop? -Yes, sir. Prabhu, how much time does it take to travel from Laxmi Narasimha Swami temple to Cherlapally jail? Minimum 20 minutes, sir. -Driver. -Sir? How long will it take to reach Cherlapally jail from here? -10 minutes, sir. -Okay. If Sriman had to reach the jail it will take him 20 minutes. I will reach the jail in exactly 10 minutes. If he is not there then he is the killer. You people start immediately! Yes, sir. -What happened? -Traffic jam, sir. Reverse it and take another route. There is a traffic jam at the back, as well, sir. -Hey, what are you talking about? -Hey, what are you doing? What is the problem? Can't you see that there's a traffic jam? Who gave you the right to interfere? Clear it soon. Lift! Lift, please! Lift! Quickly go and clear the traffic! Hey! Come! Come on! Good morning, Mr. Gyaneshwar. Very good morning. Sir? Why did you fix the camera in Srimannarayana's cell? IG ordered to, sir. Who is involved in this? Sir, Bail Reddy, Pulakeshava Reddy, IG, and Harshad. Where was Srimannarayana since morning? Sir, he was in the cell. Jai Jawan scam! I exposed it in just three days! I helped the military personnel get their land back. -Is Srimannarayana in jail, sir? -Yes, he even wished me good morning. Bring the file related to the Jai Jawan scam. What is the link between the three people who died... and the three people who are alive? If we catch those three people... then we will get a solution for the Jai Kisaan scam. CBI has been keeping an eye on me. Do as I say. There are CCTV cameras on traffic signals... opposite the complex at Kalamandir. I am sure there must be recorded visuals... of Bhanu being kidnapped on it. -Collect them! -What an idea, sir! Your idea is wonderful! You will definitely get acquitted... from the visuals of a CCTV camera. After that... Hey, come here. -What? -I asked you to come closer. What are you staring at? I know how to make you speak up! You are connected to the murders, right? The jailer is helping Srimannarayana by leaving recorded messages. -Hello? -Sub-jailer Sai Ram speaking. I'll tell you the truth. -How much will you pay me? -What truth? The jailer is helping Srimannarayana in jail. How do you know? Tell me! Who gave you a cell phone inside the jail? Tell me! It's sub-jailer Ram, right? Why are you staring at me like that? You know, right? The CBI is on alert. Come quickly. Be careful, if anyone catches you, my life will be at risk. I'll take care of it. Even if you stay mum I know how to make you speak up! I know it very well. Scoundrel! You took money from us, you made us trust you and then you're getting us killed by him! Why did you do that? Tell me! -Tell me! -No! Don't kill me! I will tell you. I will tell you. Rupees 5,000 crores. What will you do? Why do you require it? Why do I require it? Flaunting your money? Hey, don't you want facilities inside the jail? Even your father will provide them. You will provide Scotch in this jail. Even if I don't ask, you will give me chicken 65. If I get bored then you will arrange a dance. I will provide all these things. But what do I get in return? I won't give a single penny. Hey! You won't see any mark on your body if I hit you, but you also won't be able to walk. If I hit you then you won't be alive, Shankar Reddy! Alias Shankar Naik! Yes, you heard it right. Shankar Reddy! Son of Narayan Reddy. Birthplace, IB Thandur. Adilabad district. Being born into an upper caste, you bagged the job that should have been an ST candidate, by providing a fake certificate. If this matter is leaked then you will lose your job. Under section 415, 420 IPC, five years of rigorous imprisonment. You will eat food in the same jail. Shankar Reddy. What do you want? Hey! I am a politician. I don't believe anyone. But you made me believe you and then you deceived me. If he blackmailed you, and you fooled us. You can make as many mistakes as you want, but you should commit a mistake without making a mistake, you scoundrel! Stop right there! Zoom it! Yes! There. We have proof that the famous Journalist Sriman is innocent. Who kidnapped Bhanu? Why is the CBI not conducting interrogations in this matter? Can't CBI do what a journalist does? If this case remains unsolved, then people will stop trusting CBI. Why are you showing this to me? The media is already mocking us. Before the public starts yelling at us, finish the inquiry... -and submit it to the court. -Yes, sir. After considering the court trial... we support CBI's claim that the culprit Srimannarayana... is not guilty in the Jai Kisaan Scam and I order to release him immediately. Thanking CBI in this case, I order Srimannarayana to cooperate with CBI when needed. You have to become the heartbeat of every farmer... to fulfill your father's dream. Let's go. They are waiting. -Greetings! -Greetings! Mr. Kailash Narayana Murthy did not die. He is still alive in you. I will live up to the trust you had in my father. Sir. Forgive me, sir. -I spoke ill of you that day. -You did not say anything wrong. You reminded me of my duty. Greetings, sir. -Greetings, sir. -Greetings, sir. The three of them are absconding from the city. Houses and offices are locked! Their cell phones are switched off, as well. Sir, Harshad is in Malaysia. Bail Reddy and Pulikeshav Reddy have absconded. Oh, no! They are digging their graves. If we had arrested them they would have been alive in jail. It's fine that he has covered his head with a shroud. But I think he will not leave us until he covers you with a shroud, as well. What happened? You are laughing? Witch! Silly woman! I am scared of getting killed and you are laughing while watching TV? Narayana. Srimannarayana. Hey, you... I told you that, even if a dog comes in the vicinity, it should blow up. Understood? Sir, I have planted landmines all over the farmhouse. If he comes here then he will die in the bomb blasts. -Go! Go! -Okay, sir. Priest, instead of watching me like that why don't you perform special prayers to avoid my death? Okay, sir. Our senior priest performs one such special prayer very well. Idiot! You, idiot! -Why are you shivering and beating me? -What special prayer? Idiot! We should be roaming around the temples. But we are roaming around bombs. Idiot! Stupid, fellow! Priest! Priest! If you step on any landmine in anger, and if it blasts, even I wouldn't live to conduct any rituals. Don't utter a single word, just follow me. -Come on. -My life is ruined because I followed you. -Stop, priest. -Why? It could be a bomb. -How can you say that? -I will tell you. Priest, we will throw this on the bomb. If it blasts, that means there is a bomb. If there isn't, then we can go. Let us throw it and see. -It didn't blow up. Let's go. -Idiot. Would any bomb blast if you throw lightweight stones? You should test it with a bigger stone. Priest, there it is. Bomb blast? That means, Srimannarayana must have come and died! Wonderful! Where? Where is his dead body? I thought Srimannarayana came and died in the bomb blast. I was happy! But you spoiled my happiness! Do one thing. Step on another bomb. You will only become a prayer. Priest! Even the astrology book is torn along with our clothes. Rather than staying here with him and dying, it's better to go to our wives and die. Oh no! They went to collect wood sticks and they stepped on the bomb it seems. Their clothes have been shredded to pieces. He hasn't arrived yet and I haven't died. I am scared, dear. You are a giant, aren't you embarrassed about being afraid? What will you do with the 5,000 crores? You don't even have any kids or anything. Bail Reddy. ACTIVITY Why are you on TV? Did you do something wrong again? Bail Reddy's illegitimate child, has gone viral. Bhanu challenges you for a DNA test! Oh my god! Let us talk to her and find out the truth. Please don't say that I am an illegitimate child. I am a legal child of my father. Of me? Do you have any proof? Ask her that. I only have one proof and that is my mother. Where is your mother then? -She is dead. -Good riddance! But why didn't you reveal this matter for all these years? My mother hid this matter as long as she was alive, To save my father's reputation. Instead of dying silently, my mother told me that Bail Reddy is my father and then she took her last breath. So did you meet him? -She didn't meet me. -Yes, I met him. I called him father with love. -Damn it! Get lost! -He said, damn it! Get lost! I pleaded before him. I touched his feet. -He thrashed me with the same leg. -Stupid woman! Whatever it may be, he is my father. Do you have any proof stating that Bail Reddy is your father? -Say it! Say it! -Is this photo enough? -Stupid fellow! Did you cheat on me? -This is not real, it's fake. Fat man! I'll... How can I kiss this dirty girl? You would have given it to her mother, that's why she was born! Watch! Look carefully! Is there any similarity between this face and my face? Only the color is different. But her nose and her eyes... -Everything's the same! -Damn! You know that I am unable to eat because of BP and diabetes. How can I love someone? You want to shower your love on that woman, and all you want me for is to just stay with you! You don't cry, dear. Believe me. I don't trust you. If you have guts, shame, and self-respect, call her and make me talk to her. Only then, I will believe you. How would I know her number? Wait, I have the Channel's number. I will call them. Hello. Bail Reddy speaking. If anybody comes and tells your channel people something, will you telecast it? Wouldn't you inquire about it? Look, someone came and... Sriman, the signals are coming from Nallamalla forest. Thank you. I will shut your channel down. -Do you believe me now? -Oh, no! I am not going to trust you just because you said so. I won't see your face and I won't stay here for another moment... until you sort out this thing. Hey, driver! Start the vehicle! Wicked wife! I am worried sick. And you! Go! Go to your village with the driver. Hey! I knew it! You killed my friends after coming out of jail. So, the forest isn't going to matter to you. You will kill the person who is holding a sword but you won't kill the one who catches your feet right? Don't kill me! Give it to me! Come on, die! Die! Why won't it fire? What a concept, man! You would shoot if you had the gun. But when I had the gun you fell to my feet. Please forgive me. I have made a mistake. Thrash me. But don't kill me. I will tell you my password. Help those poor farmers. Please, move the gun. -My password is 'N'. -Hey! Sixty years of your life are all a waste. That six feet of land will also be useless after you die. I don't need to kill you. You will die if you move your leg. Srimannarayana, I told you the password. Why are you leaving me here to die? Hey! Where are you? Come soon! Defuse the bomb! Many people have died in the landmine blast which took place near Nallamalla Forest guest house. At present, the Nallamalla forest guest house area is dangerous. Former Minister, Mr. Bail Reddy accidentally died in the blasts of landmines planted by the Naxals. Srimannarayana had used cylinders earlier and now the Naxals. Cousin! What is this? You can ask me to towel dry your head! Yes, I'll ask everything, isn't it? You should understand it yourself. Sit! -Bhanu, your waist is so thin! -Cousin! I won't dry your hair if you don't behave. Bhanu, you don't have any romantic sense. Oh, no! The milk! Bhanu, you have spoiled my mood. Are you back? Women cannot be understood. They first say no and then say yes. -Hi! -Who is it? You stay in the kitchen like a cockroach. And she will flutter around your cousin like a butterfly. -Who? -Channel sex. I mean, Channel 6. What is it, dear? Seems like your measurements have changed. How dare you towel-dry my cousin's head? -When did you come? -Just now! Oh! Without knowing anything you are making her dry your hair? No! I thought it was you. Don't act smart! You were touching her waist and she was getting tempted. -I saw everything. -I thought it was your waist. Forget my waist, he touched at different places, as well. -Where? -Here! There? -When? -Not now. That means what she is saying is true. It was about work, so I touched her. -What work do you have there? -Bhanu, it's nothing like that. I put my hand in there to find the chip, to fight... Why are you stammering, Sri? Tell her about the day when you put your leg... Did you put your leg, as well? When? Tell her about the day when I came to your flat. Maybe you don't trust me but ask him if you want. -Did you know about this? -Yes, I knew. That means were you acting as a broker and laid down the mattress as well? I didn't, I just rolled it up. -When? -When Swapnika gave her chain to you. Hey! -S, that means Sriman! -Yes. Did you give me her chain as a gift? I am doomed! You! Where did you escape? When you come back, I won't spare you! Look, since the matter has come this far, I will be clear. You are postpaid for Sri. The billing address is yours. I am pre-paid. Temporary address. He will use me when needed. When you are out of the coverage area, he will use that sim. -Exactly! -Thank you. Look, we are engaged. It's okay. He will live with you. -But he'll casually be with me. -What? She will be tempting, and you'll be vomiting. -I only have Sriman! -Sriman is the only one whom I want! -I will pour whiskey, you pour soda. -I will add ice. -If you come near my cousin again... -Do you think... -What do you think of yourself? -I am not scared of such things!

Okay. -Hello, Good morning. -Good morning. Please. Mr. Sriman, I could not talk about everything over the phone. I want to discuss a very important matter. That's the reason I called you. Yes, sir. I am coming. Just give me five minutes. -Sure. -Thank you. Good morning, sir. -Good morning. -Yes, sir. Mr.Gyaneshwar, what is this? From the three that remained, Bail Reddy died. What is happening? Sir, I called Sriman here to save the remaining two. -Sriman? -Yes, sir. There is definitely a link between Sriman and these killings. But we don't have any evidence. I called Sriman to explain it to him. Okay, go ahead. Sorry, I was discussing the details of your case. I mean about the 5,000 crores scam. Mr.Sriman, out of the six accused, four are dead. -Who could be the killer? -Me! -What? -Even I am thinking the same. If I find any clue then I will inform you first. Hello? Sir, Pulikeshav Reddy died in the blast that took place in his Spirit warehouse. -When? -Ten minutes back, sir. I want the exact time! -11:20, sir. -Okay. Mr. Sriman, good news for you. Pulikeshav Reddy is no more. How come it is good news for me and bad news for you? I thought you will catch the remaining two at least. But the killer did not give you that chance. -Can I go now? -Sure. Thank you. He is not an ordinary guy. Police have started investigating the blast that took place in the Ujwala Spirits warehouse. An accident took place in the spirit warehouse because of a short circuit that happened yesterday. Pulikeshav Reddy, the owner of the warehouse, died in this incident. For more details stay tuned to... An inquiry has begun since this was an accident, or did somebody do it intentionally? How did it happen? Pulikeshav Reddy and his wife were fleeing from the city. He went to the warehouse to collect some documents. The blast occurred due to a short circuit. Since it was a holiday, only a few people died. You reached before us as soon as the news of Pulikeshav Reddy's death came out. Mr. Gyaneshwar, I was on leave for the last five months. I just resumed work. -See you later. -Yeah! This all is my fate, Sister-in-law. He told me that it isn't safe for us to live here and I told him that it would be better if we went to the village. When we were on our way, he stopped at the warehouse. He went inside to bring an important file. That's when this incident happened. -For whom should I live now? -Stop crying! It's my ill fate... that death awaited him in the spirit warehouse and took his life. You are crying because your husband died. Lakhs of farmers are crying because of your husband. The password that your husband had has the power to stop their tears. If you know the password, please tell me. He didn't mention any password. -Tell me the truth. -I swear on my husband. He really didn't talk about any password, brother. Any son would ask for his father's property in inheritance. But you asked for my dream. You lost your life because of me. Even your dreams couldn't be fulfilled because of me. A blast took place in a spirit warehouse due to a short circuit in Hyderabad. The owner of the company, Pulikeshav Reddy died in the blast. He was the brother-in-law of the Former Minister, the Late Mr. Bail Reddy. Harshad, your plan worked very well. As the password is missing, Srimannaraya must be going crazy for the password. Even CBI will not come your way thinking you are dead. Relax! Enjoy brother! How can I relax, Harshad? I feel like stabbing Sriman to death whenever I think of him. He destroyed my reputation and property. I will plan it. I will plan his death from here itself. You don't need to kill him immediately. He must be running around like a madman, thinking that he couldn't fulfill his father's dream. We will also kill him when the time comes. Until then... Enjoy a new life with a new wife! Cheers! MR. ALLURI KAILASH NARAYANA MURTHY BORN 19-02-1953 DEAD 03-05-2012 How can I relax, Harshad? I feel like stabbing Srimannarayana to death whenever I think of him. I will plan, I will plan his death from here itself. I will not live in peace until he dies! Hello, Sriman. You have watched the MMS, right? Pulikeshav Reddy isn't dead like you think he is. He is safe in Malaysia at Harshad's place. I am sending his address. Take care. Why am I not getting high despite drinking so much liquor? Mix vodka, whiskey, rum, everything, and give it to me. Have it, man. You didn't eat anything. Eat this chicken, Brother. -Serve brother-in-law, as well, Sister. -Serve me. Mastan! Yes, sir. Book a ticket to India immediately. I have to kill him. I have to brutally kill Sriman. You! I was calling you! You came here searching for death. Eighter I should die or you should die. You came here for the password. I am waiting for your death. You can have it if you stay alive. I have written the password on this. Take it if you have guts. You are acting brave because you know only one password... but imagine my courage because I know the first four letters. You wrote it. Shall I say it? Would you like to know? 4, K, I, N. I have committed many murders. No one has dared to mess with me. Not you, but your dead body will be sent back from here. Come! Until I am alive, you won't ever get the password. I know your password. A. This feeling is enough, man. Hey! Srimannarayana, did you complete your work? Only you are left! Where is my family? Wow! You are right. My friends did not know about you and therefore they died in your hands. I won't give such a chance to you. If you want to hunt the tiger, you should use the goat as bait. To hunt you, I have used your family as bait. You fell into the trap. In your city, in your area... I'll be at your father's factory. Come! I have done my work. Harshad Kotari has kidnapped my family. -What? -Find his location immediately. Come! After seeing you here, I feel that the 5,000 crores are walking towards me. Tell me the passwords and release your family. Where is my family? I want to talk to my mother. No matter how strong a man is... he will always fall prey to sentiments. Hey, give the phone to Sriman's mother. -Son? -Mother, don't worry. -Stay strong. -Don't give him the password for our sake. This money belongs to the farmers. They should get it. Cousin, they have tied us with bombs. If I press the number here, then the bombs will blow up over there. Your family will blow into pieces. It will be difficult to find which piece belongs to whose body. Type the passwords. Number four. K! My password is I! Fourth letter is yours. Type it. You have to type the remaining two. Type the last letter and save your family. Sorry, brother. Until the amount gets transferred, I should take care of my safety, right? Until I board the helicopter you will be in this situation. What? Why is the account still closed? How can it open if I have typed the last two letters wrong? But now I know your password. Are you trying to act smart with me? I will destroy your family! And make you reveal the passwords yourself. Hey! Call from your cell and... destroy his entire family! Call! Your family is dead! The password that you created without your knowledge... ...is 4KISAN! JAI KISAAN! FOR KISAAN! Hey! Put your finger in a zero-candle bulb, it feels like an ant's bite. You put your finger in a 60 candles bulb, it feels like a scorpion's bite. But unbeknownst to you, if you touch the transformer... Rascal! You will turn into ashes! Sir, he has been caught red-handed. -Shall we arrest him? -We need evidence, as well. Can you make a single person present here testify? Hello, what happened here? He unnecessarily touched the transformer and got burnt to ashes. -Yes, he touched the transformer and died. -Yes, he touched the transformer and died. -Yes, he touched the transformer and died. -Yes, he touched the transformer and died. Sir, we saw it. I am one of them, man. Mr. Srimannarayana, I am personally sending... a check worth 25 thousand rupees to the Jai Kisaan trust. -Thank you, sir. -Most welcome. But Mr. Srimannarayana... the killer is very intelligent. Cylinders at one place, then Naxalism at another, and now the transformer... He used them very well. By the way, will you inform us if you come to know about the killer? -Please! -Sure! Thank you and good luck! Mother. Yeah, come here. Now there will be no hurdle in our work for Jai Kisaan trust. Work will begin tomorrow. From now on, every farmer will celebrate Sankranti every day.
