[orchestral music playing] [breathing heavily] [footsteps approaching] PHARMACIST: Tess? Tess? Sorry about that, I had to track down the combination to the safe to get these out. You are on some very special medication, my dear. I'm sorry about the bother. Oh, please, honey, it's no bother. It's your health. Okay, so these are gonna get you through to your next appointment, plus a few extra for safety. Remember, you have to take one, every four hours, even at night. You have your alarm set? Yes, ma'am. Good. The more diligent you can be, the better the odds you keep baby in there until your due date. Understood. Don't worry, my dad had to pull a million strings with his business buddies to get me into this trial. He reminds me every chance he gets. PHARMACIST: You're lucky, you know. We charge insurance $750 a pop for these little guys. He reminds me of that too. [upbeat music plays] TESS: Okay, so, sue me. It's stressful staying at the house. Okay, fine. Next time, I'll stay with you. I promise. My next appointment is at the same time. Two weeks from now. Mm-hmm. Are you writing it down? Okay, and can you let Dad know so maybe he'll show up for a meal sometime? SARA: Hey. Cute bag. Right. Okay, Mom, I gotta go, I'm getting on the bus. Oh, my God, please, stop. Buses are not plebeian. You can be a [indistinct] sometimes. All right. I love you. I got it. Is this seat taken? It is now. So, do you not like scenery, or you just want to be left alone? Oh, neither, I just wanted easy bathroom access. I like your gloves. I had elbow-length gloves for my wedding and I loved them. But now they just sit in my top drawer, bumming me out, 'cause I never get to wear them. I'm a germaphobe, so. I'm sorry, that must be hard. No, it's not so bad. I get to wear nice gloves. [upbeat music plays] [baby cries] Shh, shh, shh. [woman clears throat] Sorry. It sounds like someone's hungry. He actually just finished two bottles, I just need to-- Bottles? You're not breastfeeding? MOTHER: No, I am not. - I don't know-- - You know, breastfeeding is the best gift that you can give a child. MOTHER: That's great, but-- WOMAN: My children were all very good travelers. Never made a peep. - Excuse me, ma'am. - Yes? Hi. Could you maybe just give her a break? Excuse me, I'm only trying to help. I'm sure you are, but this lady is obviously doing her best, okay? Well. [crying continues] Your wedding sounds like a real fairy tale. Well, my dress did have a full princess skirt. Princess skirt for the princess. My cousin also threw up on the buffet, so. Where did you have it? Here in the city. At the Marriott. Sounds expensive. Not really, I don't think. My dad had a connection. He's a lawyer. He knows everybody. Does he live up here? Yeah, Mom and Dad. And you? I am way down at the end of the line. It's a little town called Boone. Oh, that's my stop. Oh, yeah? Do you live there too? Just passing through. Oh, well, I guess only, like, six people live in Boone. [laughs] Not really. I mean, it is small. I think it just feels extra small because we're new. We don't know anyone. You and your fairy tale prince? Right, Jack. He's on the road three days a week. Sometimes more. So, it doesn't really matter where we live. He picked a spot where we can get the best bang for our buck. He picked? Oh, no, well, I guess Boone was his idea. Yeah. But I do like it. My big thing is, I just wanted to get out of here. Of course, I was thinking more like Chicago or Denver, or someplace that doesn't add two hours to your travel time just to get to the airport. But it is nice to have our own place. Were you visiting your parents? No, not this time. I've got this dumb condition that makes my placenta really thin. I'm sorry, is that too much information? No, not at all. I have a daughter. Oh, yeah? How old? Um, she's 11. That's a fun age. She's just discovering herself, figuring out what she wants to be-- You were saying about your placenta? Right, I'm-- I'm at risk of my placenta tearing and little Krueger here coming way too early. So, I have to come up every two weeks and get a check-up and get this trial medication that I'm on. It's supposed to, I don't know, like, thicken me up. Krueger? [laughs] We're not finding out the gender beforehand and we needed a temp name. Babies are always so ugly when they first come out, so I decided on Freddy Krueger. My husband hates it. Well, fuck him. That's what got me into this mess. Oh, okay, Krueger just sat on my bladder. Excuse me. [soothing music plays] BUS DRIVER: Boone, end of the line. [clears throat] [whispers] You're very odd, but I like you. Have fun in Boone. Hi. I'm not sure what you do when someone falls asleep, but she's a germaphobe, so go easy. [orchestral music plays] - JACK: Hey. - Hi. Uh, I'm just heading into a meeting. Oh, sorry, I just wanted to let you know that I got home safe. Already? I thought you were-- Mom said Dad has some work things come up, so we didn't do brunch, which is fine by me. Tess, you know I might need another investment from him. We need to put in some more FaceTime. Yeah, I know. Maybe next trip you stay with them. - Yeah, maybe. - You took the bus, right? Yes. Although I think I'd be just fine driving. Tess, you almost fainted. Yeah, when I was in peak morning sickness and it was a million degrees outside - and I wasn't even driving. - Okay. Is our baby's life really worth the risk? Of course not. The doctor was good. Oh, good. Shit, look, I really have to run, babe, this is kind of a big meeting. - Oh yeah? With who? - You know, just people. It's sales stuff, it's boring. Try me. I'm so sorry, babe. Look, I really, I have to run, okay? You'll be home tonight? - Where else? - Good. I'll give you a call, or you call me after 11. Eleven? Yeah, and if I don't pick up, just try me in the morning, okay? -I love you. I gotta run. -[phone beeps] [somber music plays] [Tess sighs] Jesus, why do I pack so much crap? [Tess sighs] Well, almost time to feed your life sack. Gotta thicken those walls. All right, where did mommy stick those pills? [banging on door] [ominous music playing] [knock on door] Well, hi there. What are you doing here? - You've got my bag. - What? My bag? Oh, my gosh, did we? I'm so sorry, I just grabbed the first black one that I saw. I-I guess items might shift. Right. It's not a problem, I just need it back. Of course. Come in. - No, we can just-- - Oh, no, look at you. - You need a breather. - Oh, no, I'm okay. Please, just for a minute. - Yeah, just for a minute. - Good. Please, sit down. You know, I tried waking you up on the bus but you were really out. Um... - I had a late night. - Ugh, that must be nice. I don't remember the last time I had a late anything. Again, so sorry about the mix-up. I don't know why I didn't double-check. It's fine. No harm, right? Is this your family? Yeah, mine and Jack's. Those ones are his side and these ones are mine. You segregate them? I mean, not intentionally. Everyone gets along, mostly. - These are your parents? - Yeah. And they approve of your Prince Charming? He's good enough for their little princess. Uh, they get along pretty well as far as spouses and in-laws go. I bet on your wedding day, your dad took the groom aside and told him that he would kill him if he ever hurt you. I don't really know. If he did, he didn't tell me. What does he tell you? What do you mean? I just mean you look like you know, daddy's little girl. Thought maybe you two share all of your secrets. Um, no, sorry. No secrets. I'm pretty boring. What about you? Are you married? Um. No, it's just me and my little girl. She's sick. She has stage three leukemia and she's undergoing radiation right now. But she needs a stem cell transplant and I can't afford it. I mean, Medicaid helps, but it's not enough. She's lost all of her hair, nausea, and insomnia. I'm so sorry. I-I can't even imagine. It's fine. Do you want some bourbon in that lemonade? No, thank you. Um, I should get going. Where's my bag? Maybe you just want to freshen up? I told you I'm okay. The bathroom at the bus station is an actual war zone. I do have to pee. It's just through there. I'll go get your bag. No, I can-- I can get it. Oh, please, I got it all the way here, didn't I? [breathing heavily] Keep it together, you soft bitch. [shaky breathing] Oh, no. Nail polish explosion? Hey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like-- [gasps] SARA: Looks like what? It looks like I'll-- I'll need your help getting this down after all. I-- I don't know what happened. Suddenly, I just got so dizzy. Well. Maybe you should get some rest, right? Yeah, uh, that's... totally. [ominous music plays] SARA: Coming? I wonder what made you so dizzy all of a sudden. Yeah, it was weird. I must be hungry. Or maybe it's because I'm a little late taking my meds. Oh, that's right. I hope you don't mind, I saw them in your suitcase when I thought it was mine. No, that's fine. Uh, thanks for reminding me. I'm just really glad that they're not lost. Lose things often? All the time. Don't tell me, you'd lose your head if it wasn't attached, right? [ominous music flourishes] It was really nice meeting you. See ya, Tess. TESS: How did you... It was on your pill bottle. Tess McCarthy. It's a great name. Can't forget it. Thank you for the lemonade. Where is it? Where is it? Where the fuck is it? Lose something? Yes. Oh, my God, I was freaking out. My husband would kill me if I lost that thing. Sounds like a real dick. He has his moments. Do you want to come out here and get it? You can just leave it there. Oh, just leave it right here? Yeah, thanks so much. Okay. [Sara grunts] [sighs] Fuck. Of course, you had to open it, didn't you? Why don't you come out here? Come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Tess, we have some things to talk about. Please go. Not until you come and talk to me. No! I'm not going anywhere, so. My husband will be home any minute. Actually, no, he won't. Yes, he will, I can wait you out. What about little Krueger? Can she wait? I'm not going anywhere. And that's not good for you. Look at you. You can barely lift that thing. Don't worry about me. They say moms can summon super strength if they need it. Yeah, that's after the baby is out. So, you opened it. We've established that. - Did you get a good look? - No. Could you tell me his hair color? His eye color? No, honestly, no. Yeah, I just don't-- I just don't see a way around this. I think you're going to have to help me destroy the thing. Help you what? Dispose of him, the head, the bag, the whole shebang. Then we're both responsible, right? No. Again, I really am sorry. I'm not helping you do anything. Yeah, you are. You don't really have a choice. What? Come on, it's not going to be that bad. Just leave. Please, God, just take that awful thing and go. You sure about that? Might want to think that one through. I mean, your fingerprints are all over it. The zipper, the handle. But, you know, I guess I can drop it at the bus station. Leave an anonymous tip for the cops. That could work, right? [sighs] I really think we'd both be better off if we just destroy the thing. Call it a day. No evidence, no crime. You can go back to your fairytale life, and I will sail off into the sunset. Clean and simple. You're crazy. No, I'm being proactive. I won't help you. I'll kill you first. Then what? Have two bodies to explain to the cops? Well, technically, 1.1, a body and a head. Yeah, I don't think so, Princess. We have to do this. So what do we got? Forest, lots of forest. I guess we could just burn it in your fireplace, but... no. Is there really an abandoned chemical factory at the end of this road? Are you sure you're not a secret serial killer? Because, like, this is super convenient. It's all boarded up. There's security cameras, guards. Oh, yeah? This chemical factory right here? The one with all the wide open spaces and no people around. Come on, Princess. One day of work won't kill you. I'm not a princess. Are you sure? Have you ever been scared? Felt a real moment of pain? Yes. You don't know what pain is. [screaming] So, do you want to know who he is? [voice cracking] No, please, God, I don't. Relax, I'm not going to give you his Social Security number. I mean, do you want to know who he was to me? How his head ended up in a suitcase? Well, you already know that I have a daughter. Didn't mean to let that one slip, but here we are. [sighs] You know that I'm not married, but her father is. Or was, I guess. I knew, of course, but, oh, man, was he charming and powerful. He'd walk into a room and everyone would just shut up. I guess I thought that was sexy when I was young and stupid. Anyway, a few months in, knocked up. What happened? About what you'd expect. I had the baby. He offered me under-the-table child support if I promised "not to tell" his real family. Anyway, the payments started off regular, generous. But over the years, they just... Then came last night. [suspenseful music plays] Hello, asshole. Hello, whore. Whose cabin is this? Don't worry about it. Our daughter's almost done with her radiation. Three more days and I can take her home. I hope your daughter feels better. My daughter is the picture of health. I think I'm actually going to miss these little rendezvous. That makes one of us. You know this place is two miles from the nearest bus stop, right? Boo-fucking-hoo. Don't you have a country office around here? Why couldn't we meet there? Well, for one thing, that's a lot of money. Couldn't have anyone asking questions. What the fuck? This is less than half of what we discussed. It's my final offer. I suggest you take it. You fucking kidding me? We had a deal. Yeah, well, the deal can blow me. See, the thing is, I don't trust you. You give a mouse a cookie, you know what you get? Fucked by a rodent. I give you what you want. What guarantee do I have that you don't come back for more? That you keep your smart little mouth shut? Jesus fucking Christ. In 11 years, have I ever given you a reason not to trust me? Have I said one fucking thing to your precious fucking family? To anyone? You weren't desperate before. A desperate woman cannot be trusted. She needs that money. Or she'll die. Stop being dramatic. I didn't give her cancer. Get me the rest of that money or I tell everyone. There it is. You asked why we couldn't do this in my office. The other reason... was in case you did exactly what you just did. [Bob sighs] You drive a hard bargain, Princess. You know, these woods are my favorite spot to hunt elk. The rangers never come around. So if you bag one or two over the limit, no one says shit. Okay, very funny. [voice cracking] All right? I want you to understand that this was your choice, not mine. You left me with no other option. [music intensifies] - [gun cocks] - [Sara gasps] [gunshots firing] Shit! [dramatic music plays] [Sara breathing heavily] [heavy breathing continues] [Sara coughing] [Sara whimpering] I'll make it quick. [Bob groaning] [Sara screaming] [screaming continues] [Sarah gasping] [sobbing] [sobbing continues] [panting] [sound distorting] Bullshit. You really think I'd make something like that up? You really expect me to believe that you cut off a man's head in self-defense? Yeah. I was worried the police would see it that way, too. For the record, the first swing genuinely was self-defense. [screaming] After that, I... So then what happened? [Sara breathing heavily] [heavy breathing continues] [cell phone rings] [ringing continues] You motherfucker. I'm going to get caught. They're gonna notice when you don't show up. Okay, talk to me, asshole. Huh? How would a psycho like you fix this? [cell phone dings] [suspenseful music intensifies] [music continues] That one. TESS: So, maybe he'll show up for a meal sometime? SARA: Hey. Cute bag. Right. I need one seat on that bus. I got it. [music intensifies] [music stops] You bitch. Your plan to save your own ass was to pin a murder on a perfect stranger? Yeah, sorry about that. What's wrong with you? Well, you try killing the secret father of your child and see what kind of cover-up plan you come up with on no sleep. I know it sounds bad. Okay, but you have to see it where I'm coming from. Someone is going to notice that this man is missing and then someone's going to figure out about the cash. The police are going to start knocking on doors. And the only way that I could think of to keep them from mine was to give them to someone else. I know it's crazy, and-- and I know it's awful. But, Tess... if I go to prison... my daughter dies. All right, not maybe, not perhaps, she actually dies if I can't get her that treatment. Besides, once we started talking on the bus and I realized how annoyingly fucking nice you were. I changed my mind. I couldn't go through with it. But then you fell asleep. Yup. But when I woke up and I realized what had happened, I rushed over here to try to stop you from opening it. But I did open it. And so here we are. [Sara sighs] Why should I believe a word that you're saying? Well... there's this. Also, why would I come over here if I wasn't telling you the truth? Right? Why wouldn't I just let you take the fall? Maybe you're crazy. You do have a head in your bag. You think I'm crazy? I don't know. Might be worse if you're sane. Well... either way, we're in this now. So, you gonna help me? What happens if I say no? I'm not entirely sure. But I do know one thing. I still have your pills. You're a mother. You wouldn't put my baby at risk. I'm a mother. And I'll do whatever it takes to protect my child. [serene music plays] SARA: What an interesting town. [bird chirping] Is that a Steller's Jay that I hear? How the fuck would I know? Oh, testy Tessy. Cheer up. We're almost done with this hullabaloo. Look at how much fun we're having. [Tess yelps & whimpers] If you're not a fan of the great outdoors, then why, may I ask you, do you live here? I told you. Ah. That's right. Prince Charming and the desire for a home of your own. What does he do exactly? He's an entrepreneur. Of course he is. What about you? Do you work? I was an accountant. Now, you're nothing. The princess finds her Prince Charming, gets hitched, quits her job immediately, all to fulfill her one-life dream of being pregnant and barefoot in a spotless country kitchen. No offense. You are nice, so that's something. You know, I married Jack right out of college because, um, because he asked and because my parents approved. His company helps US manufacturers find cheaper, less regulated part suppliers in other countries. Ew. Yeah, very ew. The thing is, it's not a half-bad idea if you have no morals and you want to get rich. But in a surprise to no one, Jack turned out to be a really horrible salesman. He couldn't find any investors. So, we had to take a loan out from my dad. I hate my dad. He's a dick. And now, even with all of his sales trips, Jack can't find any goddamn customers. You know, I offered to be his accountant, but no, he insisted that I quit my job so we can move to this shithole middle-of-nowhere town that's literally downwind from a toxic pit. That's why my house was so cheap. It's the closest street to a lake of cancer. So, what do I do? I plan to leave him. I pack my bag, and I get ready to vanish into the night. And that's when I find out I'm pregnant. Yeah, so now I'm stuck with my absentee husband and my dick dad with no friends and my Pinterest projects. Mm-hmm. And a cancer lake. So fuck you, and fuck your assumptions about me and my so-called fucking fairytale life. You don't know anything about me. Just back off. [scoffs] Okay. I like you more and more all the time. SARA: Come on, we're almost there. Let's go. [suspenseful music playing] You weren't kidding about that cancer lake. Hope you didn't breathe that shit in, it couldn't be good for the baby. [music continues playing] SARA: Here. SARA: Hey. This isn't your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. You didn't have a choice. Besides... he had it coming. TESS: Oh! [Tess whimpering] [Tess screaming and panting] Oh, my God. Okay, easy there, cowboy. Just throw the rest in, and we'll be done. TESS: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. So long, asshole. Hey, did I see a diner in town? What? Let's go have some pie. My treat. What the fuck are you talking about? I mean, you must be famished. I know I am. No. Leave. Now. I get it. It's been a long day. Why don't you go shower, and I'll buy you all the pie you want after? Okay? [Sara hums] How's it going in there? [piano music playing] You like the showers hot, huh? You spent $27 on a candle? Boom, who knew? How many? Just the two of us. Sit where you like. Thank you. [Sara hums] See, I-- I appreciate the opportunity to pick my own table, I do, but... why put up a "wait here" sign if you don't actually want people to wait, you know? Maybe it gets busy. You're an optimist. I like it. Can I get something started for you? Yes, Rebecca, I will have a black coffee and a slice of your favorite pie. Surprise me. And my friend here will have the same, only make hers a decaf because she's expecting. Oh, boy or girl? Uh, I don't know. Uh, we want it to be a surprise. Well, I think it's a girl. That's nice. Boys can be nasty. I know, right? Off with their heads. So, why haven't you left your husband yet? I know, I know, you got pregnant, blah, blah, blah, but it's not like you got pregnant in 1952, right? Women have had the right to vote, own their your own property for what? A while now. You have family, why stick around? Why are you still torturing me? Jeez. Cool your jets, Princess. I'm sorry, Tess. Look, I-- I will leave, okay? And you'll never see me again, I promise. But not until I have a delicious piece of pie. Speak of the goddess. Well, I brought you all one slice of boysenberry and one slice of lemon meringue. They're both my favorites and I couldn't decide. And why should you have to? They look perfect. Thank you. Are you celebrating something? Actually, yes. Fingers crossed, but I think Tess here just got away with murder. Oh, yeah? Did you make a good investment or something? No, actual murder. Do you have any tips you could share? No, er, yeah, don't-- don't murder people. It actually turns out to be very stressful. Fair enough. I'll have to control myself. Yes, please, please do your best. - Enjoy your pie. - Thank you. What? Are you out of your fucking mind? It's very possible. Look, what's done is done, okay? The past is in the past. Can we please just enjoy some pie? Here. [door creaks open] - REBECCA: Hi. - MAN: Hey. Just the usual. [ominous music playing] Mm. Wow. Mm. It's good, right? It is actually. See? And all is right with the world once again. [indistinct chatter] I just need to run to the restroom. - Cool, I'll come with you. - What, I can't be on my own? - I'm sure you can, - No, I-- but I have to pee too. What was your plan there, Sparky? I just have to pee. [suspenseful music playing] I might be crazy, Tess, but I'm not stupid. Why lie? Is that a trait you inherited from your dick father? Why not just yell out right now? Go ahead. Is it because maybe... even now you don't know what you'd say? "Officer, that woman made me throw a head into a vat of chemicals." "Who? That woman right there? "That single mother with a sick child, and no criminal record?" "Yes, her." "Do you have any evidence?" "Well, no, but--" "Do you know whose head it is?" "Well, no, b--" Or maybe it's because you still think I might hurt you. You think that I wore these baggy pants to conceal some gun that I've been carrying this entire time in my pocket nestled right next to your pills? Just in case you decided to come at me and risk your own child's life. I mean, you didn't want her after all, right? She's the reason you're stuck in this two-bit town playing house instead of gallivanting around with your girlfriends in Chicago or Denver. Is that it, Tess? Are you afraid of this hypothetical Beretta that I might have tucked away? Do you? No. "Ma'am. Do you have any history of mental illness?" "Well, no officers, but... you know I did spend that one summer in college in a wellness facility when my parents found out about my little cutting habit." - How did-- - "The doctors told me that I was a model patient-- I mean, resident. Besides, she stole my pills." [suspenseful music playing] "Those pills in front of you, ma'am?" "Yes, officer." Well, ladies, this one is on me. Ah, that is so nice of you. Thank you. And I will do my best to follow your advice. Yes, please do. No murdering unless absolutely necessary. Righto. - Enjoy the rest of your day. - You too. Shall we? Well, it's been fun. Sorry. I know it hasn't. I really am sorry for pulling you into this. It's not your fault. You didn't deserve any of it. You know, I really wanted to hate you to... make all of this easier, you know? But, I have to admit. You really grew on me, so. It's almost four. Don't forget your next pill. Thanks. When that baby is born, she's going to become your everything. Do better than I did, okay? [somber music playing] [Tess crying] [intense music playing] TESS: Ow! Work, work, oh, please. CINDY: Levinworth and Johnson, how may I help you? Hi, Cindy, it's Tess. Is my dad available? I could really use some legal advice. Oh, um, hi Tess. Actually, your dad hasn't come in today. Haha, Cindy, you're very funny. This is kind of important. I'm sorry, sweetie. His car is at the Elmsley office, but no one knows where he is. What? I'll definitely have him call you as soon as we get ahold of him. O-okay, thank you. LUCY: Tess? Mom, I just called dad's office and they said that they don't know where he is. Well, I didn't want to worry you. Worry me? What the fuck is going on? Well, your father went out for a dinner meeting last night and no one's heard from him today, but I don't want to worry you though. He does this sometimes, you know? Your dad has had more than his share of misadventures, I'm sorry to say, but I swear he's going to walk in that door any second now like nothing's happened, you'll see. SARA'S CHILD'S FATHER: My daughter is the picture of health. [gunshot] You left me with no other option. LUCY: Tess, are you all right? Tess? [intense music playing] [cell phone buzzes] [cell phone dings] [cell phone dings] [Tess whimpering] [dramatic music playing] - [knock on door] - [door clicking open] Detective Crichton will be in shortly. Can I get you some coffee or water? LUCY: We're fine, thank you so much. [door clicking shut] - LUCY: How's your back? - What? You're bigger than ever. It's important to stretch every day. I don't know why they're making us go through all this. Your father's fine. He's fine. When you were young, he got on a hot streak at a poker game in Dubai. Didn't hear from him for a week. He couldn't pick up the phone? You know your father. Yeah. What if he's not coming back? Oh, honey, don't say that. I mean it. You said that he had misadventures. And you were fine with it? - That was the arrangement? - Tessa! What do you want me to say? It's not a perfect marriage. It never has been. So, Dubai again? You think? Dubai, Paris, Macau. He likes to travel. Did Jack say when he'd be joining us? He's on the next flight out. After his presentation. [door clicks open] [door clicks shut] I'm so sorry for the wait. Did someone offer you coffee? - LUCY: Yes. - Great. Well, obviously we don't want to jump to any conclusions. There's still any number of explanations for Mr. Levinworth's whereabouts. Did Mr. Levinworth, uh... say anything to you about trips he was planning? People he was mad at? People he owed money to? No. I mean, he does business all over the world. It's not uncommon for him to make last-minute arrangements. What about you, Miss McCarthy? You know anything about your father's travel plans, his business dealings? Anything that can help us? Anything at all? [gunshots] No. Okay, so, what I'd like to do is... walk you through our procedure. Typically in a situation like this, the first... [string music playing] [dramatic music playing] [Tess panting] JACK: Tess, do you know where my keys are? TESS: They're right here. - Oh, good. - I need them. Don't worry, I ordered you a car, you'll make it to the airport just fine. Okay, what do you mean you need them? You can't be driving. I thought we just talked about this. We did. And I've decided that not driving just because I'm pregnant is arcane. [car horn honking] Sounds like your ride's here. Tess, do you want me to stay? No, I don't. Okay. [car horn honking] Hey, I'll be right there! Look, let's talk about this when I get back. Actually, um, I'm not going to be here when you get back. What? I'm gonna go stay at my mom's. Oh, yeah, okay, I mean, she could use the company right now. TESS: No, that's not what I mean. I'm leaving you. What? I'm not happy here. Not when you're gone, not when you come back. I don't like this life that we've built. I don't understand. If you don't like the house, we can move back to the city. No, it's not the house, it's, um... everything between us, you know, it-- it looks right. This looks like the-- the life that I wanted, that we wanted. But right under the surface... I think I'm-- I'm going a little crazy. [Jack whispering] Tess. Tess. What about the baby? Don't you think if we're going to split up, it's better for her if we just do it now? Her? - You-- you found out. - No. It's just a hunch. What do I know? [car horn honking] You should go. Have a good trip. [somber music playing] [swing creaking] TESS: Fancy meeting you here. Well, fuck. I've been living in constant fear of this... exact moment. It sounds tiring. You have no idea. Don't I? So, where are they? TESS: Who? The police. No police, just pie. - Hey, Mom. - Hey. - Did you see that last shot? - No, I'm sorry. - Hello. - Hi. I'm Tess. I'm an old friend of your mom's. SARA'S DAUGHTER: Oh, cool. Didn't know my mom had any friends. Do you want some pie? I've got lemon meringue and boysenberry. Oh, yeah sure. Mom, what gives? Sorry, honey, it's just almost dinner, okay? Hey, do you see that little boy sitting over there? SARA'S DAUGHTER: Yeah. TESS: That's my little boy, Freddy. Would you do me just the hugest favor and hang out with him for a minute while I catch up with your mom? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, sure. TESS: Thank you. Hey, if you push him on the swings, he'll love you forever. [laughing] SARA: You had a boy. TESS: Like you didn't know that. How often do you check my Instagram? SARA: You haven't been updating it much. You named him Freddy? I had to. Although he wasn't as gross as I expected when he came out. Hi. I'm raising him to be the opposite of my ex-husband and father. How did you find me? Had to brush up on my forensic accounting skills, but I finally found some semiregular cash withdrawals from one of my dad's shell corps. Only problem was, he didn't keep a record of where the money was going. But going over your story in my head, how you talked about him being powerful, how everyone would shut up in the room when he walked in. Wasn't hard to guess that you worked with him. I looked back at all of the women that worked in the office around the time when you would have gotten pregnant. Took a lot of digging. But eventually, I found you. I honestly still can't believe you stayed quiet. What can I tell them? He was a missing person. No one suspected foul play. And surprise, surprise, you weren't the only woman he was fucking on the side. My mom still thinks that he ran off to Europe with some French hussy or Manila with his Filipina masseuse. I figured it was better than the truth. Now that it's been five years, he's been declared legally dead, and that's that. So, what are you doing here? Why me? Now, I get that you needed the evidence to point another way, but... why me? Why hunt down my exact suitcase, put my father's head in it, and give it to me? Don't tell me that you were going to back out of it, that you weren't going to go through with it. I don't give a shit about that. TESS: Why? SARA: I needed someone connected to him. Someone who could have a possible motive for wanting him dead. But mostly I just... I hated you. I've been obsessed with you for years. You had everything. Perfect home... the perfect upbringing, the perfect college, the fairy tale wedding. [somber music playing] And a father who supported you. That little girl, She didn't get any of that. All she got was cancer and... a father who didn't give a fuck about her. All she got was me and... I know it isn't fair. You didn't even know about us. I hated you all the same. She looks good now. She cancer free? SARA: Yeah. Three years. The stem cell transplant was... awful. But it worked. TESS: There's another reason why I never told the police anything. The more I thought about your story and I'm not sure how much of it I actually believe, but the more I thought about it... the more I remembered. The bruises my mom would cover up with makeup. I remembered when they found out that I was cutting and they checked me into that wellness center. He didn't say, "I hope that you get better." He said, "Don't embarrass us." I remember him slapping me so hard, he burst my ear drum. I'm not sorry your daughter never knew him. I'm not sorry he's gone. I will always hate you. I hate me too. So now that Dad has been declared legally dead, his life insurance policy paid out. My mom gave me half. I thought it was only fair that his youngest daughter got her equal share. [gasping] [whispering] Holy shit, Tess. That's her money. She deserves it. [joyous music playing] So, what now? We go our separate ways. But first... pie. And all is right in the world once again, right? Something like that. [joyous music playing] [string music playing] ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪
