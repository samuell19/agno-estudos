[footsteps on porch] -There's Carter. -Oh! No... -Just... -I don't want it. [screen door creaks] [news continues on television] -What y'all doing? -Watching TV. -Shut the fuck up, Darla. I'm talking to Pam. -Don't talk to her like that. -What? -I said don't talk to her like that. -I'll talk to her any way I like. -No, you won't. -Mama... -Don't fuckin' tell me what to do-- I'll do whatever the hell I want. -Not no more. -Mama, don't. -'Cause we're leaving. -You're what? -Leaving. -This your fuckin' idea, Darla? -We packed our bags and all and we're leaving. -Oh, you got your bags and all, huh? And you're leaving, huh? Is them your bags? [continues indistinctly] These your bags, huh? These them, huh? Well, all right then. I guess a, I guess a couple of travelers you two are. You know what? I'm gonna help you blaze a new fuckin' trail! Come on! -Don't, Shelley! -Get the hell off me! -Pam: Shelley! -Mama... -[coughs, spits] -Darla: Stop! Shelley! Stop it... Mama... Let go! Stop! No! -Get back there! [fire crackling] -Hello? Oh, you're the guy from Leroy's. -Yeah... Carter. -Right, Carter. What are you doing here? -Well, uh... I was actually... I was just walking down the street and I, I heard a violin. I could tell it was yours. -You could? I, I didn't even know I was that loud. -Yeah, I could hear it through your window. It's beautiful. -Thank you. -It, it kind of... It's like... Something about the way you play... It's like when you have a favorite song and... And you're sad and you hear it, it makes you even sadder. When you're happy and you hear it, it... makes you smile. -That's... That's really sweet. -What, did you think I'd just let you leave like that? You're so fuckin' stupid. I can't believe how fuckin' stupid you are!
