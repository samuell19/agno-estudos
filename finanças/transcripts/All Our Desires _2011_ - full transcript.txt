- What's that, dad? - Egg custard. - Are there eggs in it? - Yep. Eat up. Arthur. I don't like it. There's skin. That's normal. The skin's very good. I don't like it. Lyon, Monday 13th September - Oscar's dog is called Pablo. - Pablo Picasso? That's not a dogs name. Why not? Can we have a dog too? - Yes, dad! A dog! - Eat up your egg custard. Can we have a dog, mum? Say hello first! Please! We'll see. Hello, love. You've hung the curtains, they look good. - Not too dreary? - Not a bit. - I did some painting. - Great! And I did a risotto. - Hungry? - Not very. Guardianship?s and trusteeship's all day, I'm shattered. What did you do, sweetie? - Plasticine. - Plasticine? A little red car, you'll see it. You gave Lea 12 euros for the outing? Yes. - Happy? - Yes. Mona! Your mother! - Goodbye, Mona. - Goodbye. Can Lea sleep over, mum? We'll see. Hurry up, I have shopping to do. - Today? - Not on weekdays. Saturday? We'll ask her mother. Come on. Madame! Can I have a satchel too? Yes. Come on. Madame! I'm Lea's mother. Hello. Did you give Lea 12 euros? Yes, for the outing. There's no need. Mona would never go without her best friend! Here. I'm sorry, I don't beg. Can Lea sleep over with us? Please, mum. I'd prefer Saturday if you agree. Just pack her pyjamas, we'll manage. See you Saturday then. - Goodbye, Lea. - Goodbye. Come on. Excuse me. So... Monsieur Chasselain... you agree to withdraw your complaint if Virtelec repair your electric gate free of charge? Yes. Do you agree, Monsieur Vergne? Yes, Your Honour. Excellent, gentlemen. I hope we won't meet again. Next case. We now call Madame Celine Hersant. - Good morning, Counsel. - Good morning, Your Honour. Good morning, Madame. Good morning. You have been summoned as the Crefiref has filed a lawsuit against you. I see you have several more litigation cases pending: back rent, the inland revenue, and 3 loan companies. Do you know how much you owe? To the Crefiref alone? 15,000 euros? No. 18,000. 18,200 euros, in consumer credit and penalties. Your repayment installments total 440 euros a month. You haven't honored them for 5 months. Correct? Correct, Your Honour. You raise two children on your own. On benefits, job hunting... I've found a job. Part time. At Bricorama, check out. I see. Counsel, considering... Here. I see that despite this lawsuit, you took out another reserve loan with Crefiref on June 11th for 2,000 euros? The social worker advised me to borrow it, to pay the electricity bill. 2,000 euros? I repaid some of the other loans loo. And some back rent. I don't spend, Madame. I gave you that money back. I'm frugal. My client can't go on financing behaviour like this. Yet they granted a 2,000 euro loan to a woman who's already in debt. Just a sum in reserve. Crefiref forces no one to use it. What do you suggest for the payments? Staggering them? No. We stick to 440 euros a month. My client can't wait forever. How much do you earn? 610 euros a month. Plus family benefits and alimony. You do have an income. He hasn't paid alimony for over 2 years. He left, I don't know where he is, Croatia maybe. He never even rings. He took out the first loans. I don't spend a penny. But I'll pay you. I'll pay you back. But how can you pay 440 euros every month? You have two small children. Surely you should pay the rem first, and keep your home? Excuse me, Your Honour, don't encourage Madame to renege on her debts. My work is to take the appropriate decisions. I apply for a postponement of the hearing. Very good. But I don't see what new elements will change my mind. Next case. We now call Madame Sadia Keetam. Valence, Saturday 18th September We have the result of your scan. There's something we don't like. I'll show you. You see this white patch? We don't like it. What is it? A glioblastoma. What's that? A tumor? A kind of tumor. Will you operate? Not where it's placed. Yes, come in. You see, it's invading this area. The cerebral parenchyma. We can't touch it. It's not good news. But we'll find a way to treat it. Doctor Stroesser will be looking after you. Hello, Madame. Hello. I was saying we must begin treatment. We have a new protocol that is fairly successful. The treatment takes 4 to 6 weeks. 5 sessions a week. Radiotherapy and chemo combined. EXCUSE me a moment. Mum, it's me! - You alright? - Yes. - You bought a new TV? - I had to. Want a coffee? Yes. Have you moved in? Yes. Is the house nice? Yes. You've been summoned again? Leave it. Here, bring the saucepan. How much did I! Cost? My old one was tiny. Everyone has a big screen. Stop fussing. Don't worry, I'll be alright. The hearings on the 17th, you must go. Can I see your file? If you wan! To help me, just tell them to back off. You know it doesn't work like that, mum. I took the electricity bill. Don't, It's my problem. They'll cut you off again. If you drove 100 km to preach, you should have stayed home. They're over the moon... Hi. Celine brought Lea round. - Right. Hello. - Hello. I've put her teddy in. She's not used to staying at friends. Not very. It seems to be going well. Some orange juice? No, thanks. I also came to thank you. - I was lucky it was you. - I just did my job. But what will they come up with next time? Can Zoe sleep here? Mum, can Zoe sleep here? No, darling. We're talking... - But Mona has her friend! - Your turn next. Zoe hasn't got her things. Next weekend, Arthur. How's it going with the other credit companies? I don't know. They send summons and formal demands. They come knocking every week. You need a full time job now. I'm looking. - Any qualifications? - Secretarial certificate. I'm coming home from school... I'm walking up to the house... I go out onto the balcony... I close the shutters... I shut the door tight... and I go to bed. Again. No, darling. Sleep well. - All asleep upstairs? - Yes. How amazing to find that girl in from of you! She told me what you did. Great stuff. What's angelica? It's for fish, and marinades. I planted that too. A cherry tree. Bigarreau, the big black ones. In 2 years time we'll have 5 kilos. We're good here. What's wrong? Nothing. You smell delicious. The only girl who perfumes her breasts. - Know many others? - Hundreds! What is it? Your mother again? She's bought a new TV. Huge, Hi Def. She says she can't live without it. What is it? Nothing, go to sleep. A gradual decline oi' cerebral activity... a breakdown of all vital functions. Monday, 20th September - Your Honour? - Yes. I'm listening. I know her, yes. How much did you lend her? The bench confirmed that you lent her money. How much? Twelve euros. - Twelve euros? - Yes. For a school outing. She repaid me the next day. It's ridiculous, I do know her vaguely but I'm impartial. I was informed of your conclusions: you advised her not to pay, yet you claim you're impartial? I simply applied the law. She's penniless, the credit company... The law does not allow you to sweep aside a contract! It's the basis of civil rights. I don't know what they taught you at Law School. An application on grounds of suspected partiality! We have better things to do. Than do our job? You're off to a bad start. You've failed in your ethical obligations. I'm taking you off the case, and starting disciplinary proceedings. You will be suspended, at the least. He's often been hauled over the coals bu! He fights back. It's pointless. It doesn't matter. It does matter! You can't just do nothing. Don't break a heel as well. Claire Conti? - My clerk insisted on this meeting. - No problem. - What would you like? - I've ordered. A Vittel, please. What's going on? I don't understand. You lent this woman money? No, that's irrelevant. It's because I'm under disciplinary proceedings. My clerk said you handle excessive debt cases. Yes. I'm off the case, this woman will go back before the Court. Would you take it on? I can't let her down. She thinks she's in the clear, thanks to me. Do you know her? Slight?!'- Your appeal would be overruled anyway. - Not necessarily. - It would. The Court of Appeal is tough on credit. They go by contracts, if people sign they must pay. Contracts full of irregularities. I know. Everyone knows. Drawn up in point-size 5, unreadable. In what? Point-size 5, the size of the letters. 2 millimeters, that's tiny. But no one gives a damn. When did she sign them? Over 2 years ago? I think so. For sure, so there's foreclosure. Loan companies know the Court of Appeal loves foreclosure. So they delay pressing charges. No renegotiation after 2 years. That's how it is. What would you have done? Patched it up. Reduced the penalties, without risking the Court of Appeal. 10 years ago I judged like you. Overruled every time. I don't like the rich ripping off the poor. But credit means consumption, consumption means the system. Hands off. So only we can act, but we don't. I wouldn't do any better. That's not what I heard. So you won't take on the case? I'll go gently. Not good enough. Anyway, It's lost in advance. Then forget it. The other way round. - No, let me. - No way. Here. Try to disengage or you'll make yourself ill. Excuse me, I have to go. Thank you... For the advice. Stick with it! Hang on in there! Go for it! For fuck's sake, Seb! Don't give me: 'They're faster than us.' That's not what it's about! Normally, you always run faster than him. But you go: 'I'm an opener, It's not my job.' So you don't risk it, and you dump the ball. That goes for all of you! 7 points don't matter, no! If you wake up in the second half and whop them. I want to see your commitment! Like with Annecy! You weren't scared and you enjoyed it! - What? - Annecy wasn't them. They are not better! If you play safe you'll have a weak game. I'd rather lose points bu! Go for it all the way! Let's get out there! Fullbacks, focus on the throw, not the line-out! And don't be scared of penalties! Kick ass! Come on, guys! We're on home ground! How are you, old man? - Is that you? - Yes. - Did it go alright? - Yes. - Did you win? - No. Mathieu called. He says can you take the red desk over? Yes. When? I don't know. He moved 2 weeks ago, he can wait a week. What was the damage? 17 to 25. I was itching to get my studs on. I'd like to see that! What's wrong? - Nothing. - Miss your son? No. Coming? Yes. Monday, 2nd October Madame must think first and not take out endless loans. She's a compulsive spender, she doesn't deserve special allowances. Crefiref has tried to help her respect her commitments, bu! She hasn't done so, she's taken out new loans. With Crefiref again. Lending to responsible adults is their job. And Madame Hersant is not under supervision. On this contract, where it says: 'Satisfy all your desires!' I read: 'A reserve account for free'. What is free exactly? The loan costs, probably. I can't see it. Please show me. Here: 'Take out a cost-free loan'. I see. Thank you, Counsel. So the interest rate is at 3.48%.. For... the first 3 months. And then? How much for the following months? Wheres the interest rate? I can't see it anywhere. Here! Lend me your glasses? Ah, yes. 21.35%! Not cos! Free after all. I need these. But it is in tiny Matters. Do you have a ruler? 2 millimeters, point-size 5. The legislator must be long-sighted too, legally the letters are point-size B, written in point-size 8, minimum. This is in 5. All contracts are like that. No one's complained. This one was signed 3 years ago. If it was signed 3 years ago, It's been renewed. You have renewal letters? No, it's a revolving credit. Renewal by tacit agreement. Yes. It's standard. I read here: 'A loan renewal must be preceded in 3 months by a letter 'to the borrower...' Weren't those letters sent? I also read: 'The global interest rate must be on the first page, ?clearly legible.' It's not the case. So this is an illegal contract. And the 'free' reserve account proposed is misleading. Where is this going? I'll tell you. Madame Hersant took out a 21,000 euro loan, right? Today Crefiref demand 18,200 euros. Stop me if I'm wrong, in 3 years she has repaid, in interest, penalties, insurance, loan fees and reminders... 22,127 euros. The consequence of unpaid debts. Since this contract is unorthodox and has no value, I consider the capital repaid in full. I cancel Madame Hersant's debt. What's the point of bringing all this up? You know what will happen in the Court of Appeal. Thank you, Counsel. You will be notified. Thank you, Camille. Hello. I'll be upstairs, Stephane. I was in court. Bravo for the point-size 5, it hit the spot. It was all hot air. I was smart but that fool was right. Your friend will pay through the nose. Why did you do it? If you're so sure? Come on. - Did you come on your own? - Yes. You shouldn't drive now, you know. Come this way. I'd rather stay here, if that's OK. How will your treatment help me? It will slow the tumor down. You'll live longer. Like a zombie. Thin as a rake, bald, in the loo all day. There's a woman on the Net, her kids don't recognize her. All that to die 3 months later. - The Net isn't always... - It's people! Pages and pages of them. How long do I have? Tell me. Every case is different. But placed there, without treatment... I have to say not long. How long? I don't know. A few months... And with treatment? A bit longer. Depending on your metabolism. How much longer? A month? 3 months? A year? I want to know. Is a year possible? I don't think so. Then don't hassle me. Just give me painkillers. Have you talked to your husband? He agrees. But I want to see you every Saturday. I can only prescribe morphine for a week. If you change your mind call me anytime. I'll give you my cell number. Thank you. What about the Brover case? The Braver case'? Appoint a guardian or she'll be robbed. We have 9 hearings tomorrow morning. - Don't stay late. - I promise. - Goodbye. - See you tomorrow. Yes? I don't believe it! I suppose so, yes... Thanks, but I must go now. Bye! Claire! Excuse me. Claire. You take this bus too? The Hersant judgment is confirmed. They accepted that the creditor was time-barred on the first loan. The renewed loans are under 2 years old. They confirmed my judgment. The shit's hit the fan! The Supreme Court? I doubt it, they don't want to make waves. If they do go there we're legally in the right. The President of the Court of Appeal is furious, the loan companies are up in arms. It's hit the fan. - Great, huh? - Yes. I've waited fucking years for this! Thank you. Yes, really. I must get off, my car's here. Goodbye. Good morning, sir. Your ticket, please. - I don't have any ID on me... - Well... Thank you, Lina. With friends, yes. I'll put him on. Take care, Lina. Your mother. It's not a good time, mum. We got a bit lost. Hello. Marthe. Claire. - Nice to meet you. - Me too. - Good evening. - Here. Thank you, I love anemones. I invited Celine Hersant. She wants to thank you. - It's the Supreme Court. - Shit. No big deal. I don't see what they can do. And the credit companies want to see me. I think we annoy them. Come in. - Hello, Sophie. - Hello, Stephane. - Good evening. - Hello. Thank you. Thank the Court of Appeal, not me. - Hello. I'm Marthe. - Sophie. Claire? Here. What's on the scallops? Truffles. On a bed of asparagus puree in a verbena and balsamic sauce. Eat up, it'll get cold. She's coming. What amazing chicory. You should open a restaurant! I prefer the top venues. I'm a sauce chef, serious cooking needs a team. Not a one man band. Like it, Celine? How wonderful to do this. The truffle did it, not me. What do you do, Celine? Sales. Check out. But I may change jobs. I'm seeing Avis for a job. Great. Does Claire know? Not yet. Excuse me. Alright, love? Yes. What is it? Just girls' stuff, I'm coming. Sure? Yes. OK. I'll keep I! Hot for you. Thanks. I'm coming. Aren't you going to blow? All there? Perfect. - Can I blow? - It's not your birthday. - Thank you, my love. - Like it? Love it! Thank you, Sophie. I said no presents! I hope you enjoy it, I was hooked. Thank you. What's this? It's Malinke. From Abidjan. She's Justice. She has a headache. It does happen. Thank you. It's crazy. Thank you. - Not bad, eh? - I prefer the blue one. - And you' Lea'? - Me mo. Or else there's this one... Yes! Try it on. Here. - I like it best. - Me too. - Pretty, huh? - Yes. Claire, we're wailing. Come! What are you doing? What do you think? If I was Avis I'd take you on like a shot! - Our place next time! - Right. See you Monday. Yes. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Thank you. I'll pick them up at 1.30? 1.15. I must be a! Avis at 2.00. OK. See they bring their macs, you never know. - Where are you going? - Courzieu Zoo. When? Tomorrow, Hold you. With Lea and Zoe too. But I'm going to mum's. I need the car. - Again? - Yes, again! They can go another day. No, I can manage, I'll get the train. Go on, they're dead beat. It'll work out. Bye, Lea. Goodbye. Can't you visit your mum on Sunday? Well? Saturday, 2nd November Hello! I have to go to Valence so if you'd like a lift? Yes, that would be great. Come in. I have to take a desk to my son. Does he live there? Yes, in Valence. I'm coming. - Whereabouts? - The centre. - And your mother? - The suburbs. But I'm going to South Valence, the hospital. - Is she in hospital? - Yes. Thank you. It's complicated by train. Miles from the station, you need 2 buses. Anyway I'm going that way. You're from Valence? No, Grenoble. But I went to Uni here. Don't you miss it? - What? - Grenoble. Not much, no. You don't ski? No. Do you? No. I'm into rugby. But I don't play now, I train. Ever heard of the Lou Rugby? No. A good team. I'm with the 2nd team. Thank you. Why do the credit companies want to see you? I emailed 200 judges, saying the judgment was confirmed on appeal. It may give them ideas. The credit companies must have heard. One lone judge doesn't bother them. But they don't want it snowballing all over France. Nice one. We'll see. Hungry? No. I'll get a sandwich. A Yogurt? No, thanks. She's left. Will this be a consultation in the street? Here's the morphine. This one: 2 a day but no more. And this: 1 every 4 hours. Thank you. I put in some Temodal too. It's chemo. But useless without radiotherapy. I said I don'! Want it. I'll buy you a coffee. Downstairs. It's disgusting here. Come on. I'm done. - It went well? - Yes. - Like a drink? - No, thanks. Thank you. Good luck. - Thanks. - Bye. We were talking rugby. ...3 goals to 2. 4 pm, here's Florence with the weather forecast. A we? Night ahead... low pressure from the west in {he Rhone Valley. Rain forecast... Anything wrong? We're playing tonight, it will rain. Against who? La Rochelle. They're good. Do you know this? No. Rickie Lee Jones. My son turned me on to her. Do you like it? Yes. What do your parents do? Mum worked for a transport company. And your father? - He's dead. - I'm sorry. I can't imagine you playing rugby. Really? What do you imagine me playing? I don't know. Brutes battering each other for no reason. Rugby has it all. Commitment, emotion, strategy... I don't see emotion. It's inexplicable. I'll take you one day. I don't understand the rules. No one does. And they change all the time. After 35 years, I don't understand! First, we are well aware that competition between loan companies has resulted in an aggressive commercial policy towards our clients. We believe feedback like yours can help us restructure. That's why we've come here, to see how we can keep within the boundaries and avoid endless legal battles that no one likes. Except lawyers. Right. It's quite simple. There's a law. Respect it when you draw up your contracts. Of course, but it's hard to apply. It depends how It's interpreted. As you know. Your colleagues in France apply it, and it's accepted. Or used to be, but you're dragging other judges in now. They're free to do what they like. I don't see what we interpret. Legally you must inform your clients of the loan cost. It's simple. Not really. State the interest rate on page 1, no! 3% when it's 20%. And we'll back off. But maybe people wouldn't sign the contracts? Of course they would, they have no choice. People who come to us can't borrow elsewhere, so it costs them more. You ask us to 'inform our clients'. But they don't give a damn. They want the money. And lending money is our job. So we advertise. But your ads are misleading. '3 000 euros for 1 euro a month!' 'Dip into your free reserve account.' So people who are poor believe they can buy anything. Then you leave them worse off than ever. That's the problem. Do you know the consumer credit total in our economy? 130 billion euros. What would happen if you made us turn the tap off? Maybe you'd prefer a world without credit? Without ads? No TVs, fridges... Just a world where you can't ride roughshod. That'd do. Excuse me. We came here to find common ground. Everyone has a job to do. Yours is making money out of people who don't have any, bu! Who have needs. And desires too. Ours is to put all that in order. Excuse me a moment? Claire? What is it? Aren't you well? I'm alright. Just something I ate... What's wrong? Nothing. Let's go back. No, I'm taking you home. - Why, have they gone? - Yes. Come on. What did they say? Nothing, what did you expect? - Second floor. - Thank you. Why are you here, Mr Janik? This floor is for families! I made a mistake. Go downstairs! Or I'll call the director. Who do you want? It's OK. Found her. Hello. I saw the seals on your front door. Right. Well, come in. - Hello, girls. - Hello. - Sit down. - Thank you. Some apple juice? Yes, please. - Like some, girls? - Yes. Look what I found. Here. - Say Wank you, Lea. - Thank you. We were ezicted. Evicted, darling. It's the winter truce, they can't. The truce starts tomorrow. I told you to pay the rent. The credit companies were on my back. They came round, the kids were scared. How will you manage school? There are buses. OK? Your dress! How did it go? No good. I screwed up IT. Keep it. You'll need it again. I don't wear it. I have others too, I'll give you them. This dress is enough. Thanks. It's not so bad. We're getting somewhere bigger. - To us! - Yes. To us. Arthur, calm down! You're exhausting. Sit down! Zoe, the glove, please. Calm down. Mona, can you get it? Good evening. - Is Claire in? - Yes. - Hello. - Hello, Mona. Mum, it's for you! Come in. Sorry, I tried calling you... - What's happened? - Duret rang me. What did he want? Am I interrupting? No, not at all. Turn off the TV and have a bath, girls. I'll see to them. Please. Towels are in the landing cupboard. - Come on, girls! - Thank you. Upstairs! - Can we have a bath together? - Sure you can. - Her judgment?s been annulled. - It can't be! They dug up an old case-law to prove their point. And what? We acted illegal apparently. I'm so pissed off. I feel useless. Hi. Hello. The Supreme Court has annulled Celine's judgment. Surely they can't? The judge can't raise an issue on his own initiative. She should complain, no! Us. They say we can't. Not in the general public interest. What now? Rejudged by another Court of Appeal. And they'll be ruthless. I'm sorry. I'm a dead loss. I said we'd lose and we won, I said we'd win and we lose. Does she know? Shes just been evicted. What's happened? Claire's been there: bailiffs, evictions... Her mum kept taking loans she couldn't repay. So Claire identifies with Celine. If anyone rang the door, she had to keep quiet. Her mum held a hand over her mouth. She's not a judge by chance. She's not hungry. I don't get it. We keep hearing about mediators, commissions etc... Can't anything be done? A mediator intervenes earlier, he can't contest the judge's opinion. There's the ECJ but I don't see what they can do. And she'd have to go to Luxembourg. We could file a general preliminary question with the ECJ. What's the ECJ? The European Court of Justice. We could try something like: 'The Supreme Court says... 'but according to us, European law authorizes us to... 'Tell us who's right.' - Yes, but authorized to do what? - I don't know. But if we manage to, the ECJ lakes precedence over the Supreme Court. The problem is, what do we ask? You know European Union Law? Not very well. Me neither. Excuse me. There's lots to do on it so it was cheap. The mortgage is low. Will you manage, all seven? We'll be fine. The kids are thrilled. And Christophe? Fine. He's a sweetheart. Known her for long? - Just this term. - Is that all? We'll find a way, don't worry. Goodbye. I'll call a hotshot friend. Can you lake me to Valence Saturday? Yes. If you like. Thank you. I'll do it. Go to bed. No, it's OK. - Is there a pillow for her? - I don't know. - Where is she? - Upstairs. I'll give her one of ours. Here. How's your headache? It's OK. Not hurting any more? No. Your breasts smell so good... Can we go to Africa one day, mum? Sun up? To see the elephants? I don't know. Yes, one day. We'll ask dad. Are you crying? No. Go to bed, it's late. Get into bed, sweetheart. - What is it? - He wants to pee. Good night. Good night, my love. I'll make your bed. No, I'll do it. Careful you don't splash. - Like me to help? - Yes. I'm not used to boys. - All done? - Yes. To bed! - Good night, love. - Good night, mum. I'm in the way. I'll go back to the Centre. No, it's fine. Right? Yes. Good night. Good night. Well then... I start a! 10. I'll take them to school. Yes, if you like. - Water? - Yes, please. Will she stay long? I don't know, a few days. Do you mind? No. I don't have much choice. Or the right to a fair trial. We'll say: 'A huge discrepancy between the parties. 'One strong with powerful lawyers. ?The other weak, defenseless, etc. Unfair.' Isn't the judge there to level it out? That's for Strasbourg, the European Human Rights Court. So? We'll go to Strasbourg. We can't. And they wouldn't give a damn. - Can you turn off? - Where? The next exit. - Anything wrong? - Now, please! I'm sorry. The tollgate OK? Yes, fine. It's just to see something. Only 20 minutes away. It was here. Every summer. Not by the sea? No. The tent flap opened this way, for the view. The trees have grown, that's all. My sister and I had our first kiss on that landing stage. - Together? - In turn. Thierry Perrain was his name. After that she was in love. - Not you? - I was 13, he wasn't interested. And Flo had tits out to here. What does she do now? She lives in a Paris suburb. We don't meet often. She left when she was 17. She and my mum fought non-stop. Then we lost touch. Is it cold? It's OK. No, it's really nice. - Mind if I swim? - Now? Just for 5 minutes. Tempted? Not very. - You're nuts! - It's fantastic! Come on in! We'll swim to the landing stage! Shit! Christ! - It's bloody icy. - Yes. You're freezing. Too bad, I feel great. As good as the sea? Yes. You're cold. Let's go back. Yes. It was worth it, right? Yes. Come on. Sure you're OK? Sure I am! Stephane! Hold on to my shoulders! Grab my shoulders! Like that. It's alright. I'll take you back. There. Hang on to my shoulders. There you go. Hold tight. Let's go. Careful, it's hot. Thanks. There's a hot shower here. I'm fine, thanks. Are you sure? You'd feel better. I go! You this: chicken salad. Thanks, I couldn't. I shouldn't have let you. You're just like a kid. That looks good. - I'll come to the hospital with you. - I'm fine. No, you're not. Look at the slate you're in. - And 'Pirate'? - No. - You don't have it? - No. 300,000 CD's, no Rickie Lee Jones? No, out of stock. Maybe on a compilation. Or we can order it. Hello? Out already? The treatment room, please? - Second door along. - There? Thanks. - Come in, sir. - Hello. Dad! Take me out. Don't worry, she just fainted. But we must keep her in, try to reason with her. Sign a discharge form. At least till Monday. I don't want to stay here. Please! Your daughter isn't up to it. She's in hypothermia too. That may be the morphine. We must run some tests. Sign and let's go. Please. - Come on. - May I have a word with you, sir? Does Christophe know? No. Like a hot drink? They live in front of the TV. You must tell Christophe. It will be too much for him. He'll crack up and the kids will know. Why not try radiotherapy? It's pointless. No, that's ridiculous. It's pointless, I tell you. There's nothing to be done. We must help her. We must find a way. You understand why? Goodbye. 'Mum goes into her room 'and draws the curtains...' The 'Tour Rose' are taking me on! They rang. I start Monday. - The 'Tour Rose'? - Yes. That's fantastic! You were right to wait. It's great. Mum, we saw Kirikou! We went to the amusement park. You saw Kirikou? Where? At the 'featre'! Wonderful! Was it good? - Yes. - Yes! Then they biked all afternoon. Can we watch TV, mum? - It's loo late. Come on. - You see? Bedtime. - I won. - No, I did. OK, juniors, you now. If you're both working, I can look after the kids. No, you must get a job. I'll find someone. Hurry UP! Just temporarily. I can do it. Arthur, come on! Bedtime. Good night, sweetie. Go to sleep. Good night, darling. Can we read too? For 5 minutes. Good night, sweetie. Want to read Tchoupi? 'Tchoupi bakes a cake.' Lights out in 5 minutes. They'll be raving it up all night. They can sleep tomorrow. That washing machine is on non-stop since we arrived. You smell nice. What is it? Guerlain. - There's violet in it? - Yes. It's lovely. My gran used to smell of violets. Here. Stop! It costs a fortune! That's alright. Hello, old man. We started without you. I'm sorry, I forgot. Better tell them. - Can I help? - No, go on in. You make your absence felt! Alright? The heart's on in there. - Any bread? - There. Luc is in a state. Yes. You must have a site! Yes. It's all bullshit! Print sales have dropped 30%. So you're competing against yourselves. No, the big portals are our problem. They're destroying us. Some coffee? - Yes, please. - Me too. - A decaf, please. - OK. Don't you wan! Coffee? Yes, sure. Plus the news on cell phones, we're finished. They just cut and paste news agency reports. It's unfair competition bu! No one lifts a finger! So attack them. Attack Big Brother? Why not? Surely you can plead unfair competition. I don't know. I could check. More mousse anyone? My liver says better not. Nora? No, thanks. It's like downloading, no one saw it coming. So newspapers and TV networks will all disappear? Will change, anyway. You alright? And you? You're very quiet. I'm a bit out of it. Take that in, I'll do the rest. Fabienne's decaf is done. - How many more? - Two. Unfair competition - Where's he going? - Shopping. Does he bite? No. Give me your hand. Arthur! Slop scaring Zoe. She's not scared. Are you? Yes, I am. What's that? It's Berry. Lady, I regret it! All the bad stuff We done I sing flat. No, go on. A perfume of rum Clings to skin like a man I'm afraid I know it all - Claire! - Love will be my downfall Can you go? I'd like to finish this. A problem? No, it's fine. Can you give me a hand? Sure. Hold this while I screw it in. I'm no good at it. It looks perfect. Hello. Anyone up for these? You bet. Come in. - Coffee? - OK. Thanks. How's things? Not too bad. We're on the wrong track. Mum! We got in! Hello, Stephane. Hello. We'll call him Pierrot! Who? The dog! You said yes. I said we'll see. Here... One each. Dad's bought a swing. A swing! Give some to the lime ones. And to mum and dad too. The wrong track? Yes. Customer Defence, protection of the weak... Bullshit. The ECJ don't react emotionally. Europe is a market, their job is to see it works. We need something else. Pass the spanner, please. No, the other one. What is it now? I hurt myself. Come here. They each have their method. 'Deferment of payments in a case of major setback, 'with no penalty', apparently... Then they say how much a major setback costs: an extra 2%! 'Contango fee' they call it. Misleading advertising. But they're supposed to read it. Here, they state the real interest rate though, unlike the others. 3.5% instead of 19.40%. If I needed money, I'd go for it. What's that? Papers. Mum's working, love. Hold on... All we see is the debtor's point of view. If I was this credit company and I read that, I'd say: 'Hey, they'll all go there. 'That's unfair competition.' Right? Isn't it? It breaks the rules of competition. The rules of the market. - And the market... - Is Europe. The ECJ may be interested if we raise the issue. That's it. You've got it. Got what? All done, Arthur! We must move fast now. Claire! Harder. Stop! Go on, push harder. - That's harder. - That's high. 40 Marlboro?s. Did you sleep OK? No. No way. It's useless, really... Goodbye. I'll draw it up and call you. What? Claire, you're not serious! Please go home. But I'm quite alright, don't worry. Yes. See you later. Mademoiselle? - Madame? - Mademoiselle? Mademoiselle? Stop the bus! An epileptic fit. She's recovering now. - Has she had fits before? - I don't think so. Has she ever had a drug problem? She's probably taken something, as well. Can you give me my shoes? You must call Christophe. - What are you doing? - I don't want to stay here. If I can walk to the door, will you take me out? Right. Here. Go on. It's me, honey. I fainted on the bus, bu! It's OK, don't worry... I'm in hospital... Edouard Herriot. Edouard Herriot Hospital. But It's nothing, don't worry. Love you. We must write that letter and send it. Fast. Or he'll have to pay her debts. She has a brain tumor. And it's not being treated. Her father took her out of hospital in Valence. They'll deliver the pillows between 8 and 11 am. Right. If no one's in, pick them up at the dry cleaners. And if you can bring me a couple of long t-shirts. I look terrible in this. - Shall I buy you a nightie? - No, no. My t-shirts are all I need. How's it going at the 'Tour Rose'? Good. Are they nice? Yes. I'll have to warn them. No, don't let them down the first day. When are you on? 6 pm. But I'm not going tonight. Of course you are! Celine's at home with the kids. You must go, don't be silly. Is it working outwith her? Yes. Just a bit odd being thrown together. She's a nice girl, you know. Why didn't you tell me? Me? Why didn't you tell me? The Supreme Court forbids us to raise the issue at our own initiative of an irregularity in a man contract. On the grounds that in doing so, we are acting in the borrower's interest, not the general interest of the market. However, we have found in several contracts misleading advertising clearly indicating unfair competition between the loan companies. Marthe? Have you eaten? - Have you eaten? - Yes. Tuesday, 19th November In our view, these irregularities, especially concerning interest rate, go against the European directives concerning the way the market functions. Consequently we ask the following preliminary question: Can we, a national court, raise this issue and denounce this irregularity in the name of public interest? Answer yes or no. Brilliant. If they say yes. They unwittingly change all the rules. The Supreme Court can forget it! Wonderful. I bought you this too. Rickie Lee Jones, and lots more great stuff. I don't want to die here, Stephane. I won't see my kids growing up. I promised them a dog, they won't have a mum. I haven't done half what I wanted to do. And I may never know if the ECJ's answer is yes or no, if my family can live in peace or not. It's unjust, huh? For a girl who loves justice. Baby, what's going on? Christophe rang to let me know. Why didn't you tell me? It's fine, don't worry. Don't worry? Who did you call? Your sister? I haven't called anyone. Why are you here? Why did you take her out of hospital? Because of you, she had no treatment. Excuse me. Her father! He left when she was 2, she never saw him again. You better leave now. Go away. - Excuse me. - Yes? I couldn't see the doctor. How is Madame Conti? The scan isn't good, not good at all. A risk of an embolism, or a brain haemorrhage... it can happen any time. She seems good though... Yes, I know. Monsieur Mah?? Good morning. - Hello. - This way, please. - Here. - Thanks. I don't see why this merits an emergency procedure. It has very little bearing on public safety. Don't you agree? It's vital to act fast. Please. I can try to put it through... let's see... the hearing on the 22nd, that I can do. In two weeks time? But there'll be 6 weeks deliberation afterwards. Is saving credit companies from danger so urgent? I'll see what I can do. But there's no guarantee. It's not my decision. Claire. Why didn't you come today? I've had a crazy 24 hours. My day seemed very long. The preliminary question is under way. When will we have an answer? I don't know. Quite soon. You could have shaved... Just to go out. Please. I can't stand being here. You know you can't. For some fresh air. I can hop to the door now. Claire... It was the deal, right? Look... We're Black. - What the shit are you doing? - Sorry. Charge down! Make room, guys. Sit here. Give me your hat. - No, I'm fine. - No, come on. - There. - Thank you. That was a knock on. Alright? Sure you're not cold? Crouch, touch, pause, engage. They're off again. Get it out! Pass! Pass! Fuck! There are 4 of you! Hold it, Damien! Damien! I'll deal with it, sir. No problem. Referee! The referee didn't see it. You shouldn't do that. You shouldn't play solo! You're out of it now! See what that fucker did to me? Fuck! Go for it! - Like it? - Yes. We are the champions! We are, we are! We are the champions! Wait till after the final. To the champion pain in the ass! To Stephane! He is really! He ls really! He ls really phenomenal! Dan Carter of the All Blacks has the same. Know who Dan Carter is? Give her a break, Marco. Move over. - I'm being chatted up. - Normal. They really are fantastic! You see... Marco there, rugby saved him. I better start. A drop of champagne? You bet! Are you sure? Yep. I feel great. At least I know why I'm sick. This isn't serious, I'll take you back. Who cares about being serious? And when I was 17 I looked for him. There were 11 Fran?ois Charriers in France. I checked them all, a friend drove me. Did you find him? Yes. In Poitiers. I waited outside his house for hours. He arrived with his new wife and 2 kids. I didn't have the nerve. And to say what? 'Hi, I'm your daughter.' What would it have changed? Do you mind going shopping for me? With my credit card. Thank you. For everything. I've loved meeting you. We are the champions! We are, we are! We are the champions! Monday, 25th November Put them there. What? There, where I can see them. They came to fix the boiler at last. It's working again. But the burner needs changing. The children want to come, they keep asking me. When I'm better. But you're good now. You're tired but you're good. I'll bring them on Saturday. Saturday, OK? Celine... You must buy Arthur a satchel. He's wanted one for months. Yes. Are you in pain? Go, it's time for school. I'll sleep a bit. I'll come earlier tomorrow. Tell them I love their drawings. Yes. I'll be off. - Goodbye, Claire. - Wait. In the bedside table... - This? - Yes. It's for you, Celine. For me? You're mad. - Thank you. - Put some on me. Wait. Some there too. You will, won't you? Go, you'll be late. See you tomorrow, love. I love you. Me loo. Claire? Good evening. Good evening. She's out of it, what's going on? We induced a coma, she was in too much pain. Will she be like that for long? Just before, she asked if you had an answer. I don't know what to. Claire, can you hear me? We've had an answer from the ECJ. It's a yes. They said yes. We've won. And for all the other cases. She's saved. And judges will be allowed to raise issues for anyone. It will all change. Thanks to you. They said yes. Friday, 14th January No, me! - No, me! - Please let me take him! - I'm holding him! - No, I am! - Let me hold him! - No, let me! Arthur, you'll hold him at home. I'm carrying him. - Let him go. - You'll have him indoors. Hello. Stephane! The ECJ's answer has just arrived. Open it. It's yes. They said yes. Thank you, Camille. To Laurent All our desires
