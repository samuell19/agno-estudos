Danny, should I call for backup? Danny, we should call for backup. - Hello. - Hi, darling. Did I wake you? - What time are you going to work? - What time is it? It's almost 3:15. What time did you get home? - I got in about four this morning. - Are you OK? I guess... No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine. - How are you two? - We're fine, but I'm simply starving. - You're always hungry. - That's not fair. - I know, I know. Two mouths to feed. - And don't you forget it. - When can we see you? - About seven. I don't know whether I can wait that long. I love you. I love you, too. - Over here. - Jesus Christ! - Get an ambulance! - He got the Terror! You're gonna be a goddamn hero, O'Brien. Hey, how are you doing? You gotta be shitting me. Hey, Benny, come here. Help me spot this crazy fool. - What's he training for? The Olympics? - Tell me. All right, you crazy bastard. Go for it. Show me. Come on. It's on you. Come on. Jam it up! Jam it up! Come on, keep pushing. Show us. Be committed to it. Show me. Treat it like a lady. Come on. Do something! Do something with it! - Yeah! Yeah! - Yeah! What a cop! Getting strong. Getting strong! - The fish are running tomorrow. - What time? 5 a.m. Early. I hate fish. Especially at 5 in the morning. - Maybe she'll wait. - You like that, don't you? Yeah. - It won't fit. - What did you say, honey? - I said it won't fit. - Relax. I'm gonna find plenty of room. Just wait and see. You wouldn't believe the stuff I threw away. - Yes, I would. - Don't forget the 6 boxes in the garage. Kay, aren't you listening? I said they won't fit. It was a joke. I was joking. - Would you do me a favor? - What? - Would you go and get me something? - What's that? Your sense of humor. I think you left it in the car. If you're getting cold feet, I’ll unpack. Cops are allowed to change their minds. I'm not changing my mind. It's just... Well, it's all this junk. Junk? This is not junk. This is stuff my mother gave me through the years... OK. It isn't junk and it isn't cold feet. Something's wrong. What is it? It's back. The nightmare is back. - Oh, Danny, I'm sorry. - You said it would be over. - Six months of therapy, for what? - You were the best patient I ever had. Or isn't that obvious? It's not unusual for this dream to come back from time to time. - It's been over a year. Why now? - Because you've been working so hard. You need to unwind. I have the perfect solution. The mattress is still here. - In your condition? - I'm pregnant. I'm not dead. You know what I think? I think you've forgotten how. - Moi? - Yes, you. - You're cute. - I know that. So are you. Stop teasing. Who's teasing? Oh, my God. You haven't forgotten. Very nice, Simon. Now it's time to go. Come on. Time to go, Simon. Time to go. Thank you. Let's go. - Morning, Dr. Highwater. - How are you doing? Orderly Ivy Barnes to day room six. I'll be home very soon. - How's Simon? - Fine, sir. Yeah. Well, I told you once. Yeah, I'll check it out. Goodbye. Hold it right there! Hold it! I started to get out of bed and she pulled me back in. I tried again and she pulled me back again. That's why I was a few minutes late. All right? Meat missile! I know it must be rough on you with Kay being pregnant. You must be horny as hell. Yeah, it's been tough. I tell you, these hours are killing me. - I second that. This is our what? - Twelfth. - Twelfth damn time! - My sources assure me... Your sources suck. No Victor, no drugs, nada. - Wait a minute. - Listen. Listen. Dr. John Highwater, administrative head of Camden State Hospital, told KFWB news that Simon Moon had escaped in a stolen laundry van, but lost control of the vehicle just outside the hospital grounds and drove the truck off a 400-foot cliff into the Snake River. Moon's body has still not been recovered. Moon had been confined to Camden State Maximum Security for the past three years. - It's about fucking time. - Yeah, well, he deserved worse. Did you catch the Lakers last night? No, no cable in my neighbourhood yet. What do you mean? Do you live on Pluto? - No, Tarzana, man. - Tarzana? - See over by the boat? See him? - Yeah, I see him. Hey, man, these are the worst fucking eggs I've ever had. Wait till you try the toast. You're full of shit, Vic. Let's get some coffee. Hey, Joe Boy, let's load 'em up. - They're coming. - Relax. - Give me some of your famous coffee. - Black coffee. - Who's your buddy? - My cousin Carlos. Your cousin Carlos? - Si. - Thanks. Let's go. Something stinks here, my friend. You see two guys in a car down there? The only time I ever see that, they're cops or queers. - Shit. - I hope they're queers. Amigo, take off. OK, it looks like show time. - See you on the ice. - I'm with you, bro. Victor. - You too, pal. - What's going on? You know what. You didn't pay for your coffee. Lay 'em on the ground. You, too. Drop 'em. Slowly. Let's go. Let's get the fuck out of here! Go! Come on! Get the fuck out of the way! Move your ass, Victor. Come on, go! Come on, Babo! Shit! Come on. Come on, you fuck! Well, the way I see it, Victor, you have two choices. You can swim for it, or you can give it up. I'm gonna break you like a bad habit, numbnuts. Well, that is a third choice. Now do you give up? - How about now? - I'm from the street. - I'm gonna show you what it's like. - Oh, good. - Now? - Fuck you, pal. That's not a choice. I'm gonna die. Eleven months they've been refurbishing and we're still not ready. Do you know how long that is? Almost a year. Three people call in sick. Are they crazy? The gold leaf is missing. - So, Betty... - Betsy. Betsy, you're a reverend's daughter, so maybe you won't rob me blind. "Thou shall not steal" thing? 23 years in the business, I've learned one thing. Your help will rob you blind. Let me ask you a question. - Are you gonna steal from me? - Oh, no. Go to the office, get a uniform, go upstairs, change, come right back down. - Does this mean I have the job? - Yes it does. - Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Frank, over to the left. I got the job! I've got a world premiere in five hours. Please, just work with me. Thank you. Y'ello. Manager. Yes, that's good. Champagne. Of course chilled. I got the job. You're off and running, Bets. First, you get your hair done... Then you get a manicure. Then you get a boyfriend. Daddy won't like that. Little pizzas? The mayor is not going to consume little pizzas. Understand that? - Would you like to know the baby's sex? - You can tell? Sure. - I would. Huh? - OK. - Well, she's... positioned perfectly. - She? - It's a girl? - Yes, it is. It is a girl. Look. - And she's healthy as a horse. - I knew by the way she was kicking. - What I'd like to know is when. - Any time now. You said that last week. That's what I thought last week, but then it's not up to me, it's up to her. - And she's being a bit stubborn. - It runs in the family. Listen. Take her out shopping. It'll take her mind off everything. It always does. Miss Hammond? Miss Hammond? Are you in there? Miss Hammond? Damn these kids. If you can't trust a reverend's daughter, who can you trust? Well, we're gonna have to think of a name now. How about Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien? - I was talking about our daughter. - I was talking about us. Oh, Danny, we've had this discussion. You know how difficult it is for me to make decisions. It's always been a problem. Look what it took for me to decide to have the baby. Then you ask me to move in with you. Now marriage? We have all this backwards, don't we? Backwards, forwards, what difference does it make? I'm sure we'll both know when it's the right time to say, "I do." Oh, my God. I'll be right back. - You really want that dress? - Yes, I do. It's a beautiful dress, but it's very fitted, you know? I'll wear it soon. Do you take credit cards? - Yes. You want the belt, too? - Yes, please. You can wash this yourself. It's a beautiful dress. - Yes, it is. - It's been very successful. - And it's 100% cotton. - Oh, good. Hey, watch it! Bye. Thanks. OK. You have the right to remain silent... Here, you do it. - What did he do? - He ran north instead of south. Ladies and gentlemen, the lovely Miss Ginger Franks. Please welcome, His Honor, the Mayor of Los Angeles. Well, sir, the old neighborhood will never be the same, thanks to you. No. It certainly wasn't easy, was it, Sal? Let's get on with it. Hello. The new movie War and Love, what will we see in it? It's a very exciting, thrilling movie. I'm very thrilled about it. - What about you and your leading man? - You know how the media exaggerates. - I look forward to seeing it. - Thank you. Your Honor... The Mayor of Los Angeles. What an exciting night. Can you tell us how you feel? Tonight, we celebrate an enormously successful joint venture between the generous citizens of the city and its governors. Once in a state of utter decay, we have restored the Wiltern to its former beauty. How are you? Good to see you. Enjoying everything? Good to see you again. Enjoying the champagne? - Thank you. - Ginger, we did it. Congratulations. You done me good, babe. - Hanson see you this afternoon? - Yeah. It's not gonna work out. - Damn it. He's a pinhead anyway. - How are you? - This is George. He's the manager. - It's a pleasure. - You look outstanding. - Why, thank you. - Listen, hold this for a minute. - Why? I have to pee. All right, but the show starts in 5 minutes. Keep your hair on, babe. It's imported champagne, so please enjoy it. - From France? - No, Indiana. Kieslowski's across the room from us. Shall I bring him over? - Not on an empty stomach. - Mr. Mayor, you need to see the man. - How are you? - Fantastic. My pleasure. Yeah. To hell with him. Let him swing in the breeze. Hello. How are you? - I'm fine. - Good to see you again. It's time to go in, everybody. Nice to see you again. Take your seats. Oh, damn! What's the hurry? These things never start on time. Hope I didn't blow fourteen mill on this joint. I couldn't stand that and the Rams. Come on. Enjoy the show. Enjoy the show. Anything you do find, let me know about it as soon as possible. I don't care what it is, what you think it might be. Get back to me right away. Check that out especially. Hey, buddy. - What's up, Scottie? - I got an actress named Ginger Franks. She was at the premiere last night. Her manager saw her go into the john. That's probably the last time he saw her. - What does he want? - You better let him tell you. - Look familiar? - Can I go home now? - Who's he? - Her manager. Damn it, Hero. I said I need to talk to you. Sal, if you call me Hero one more time, I'm gonna pull your tongue out. - What are you getting so upset about? - What do you want? The mayor wants you down here. The MO on this girl's exactly the same as Simon Moon's. Simon Moon is supposed to be dead, Sal. You and I know that, but it don't make a difference what we think. The press is beginning to smell Simon Moon. The mayor wants this shit stopped. The city sunk $14 million into that theater trying to restore the neighbourhood. So what does he want? He's scheduled a press conference at 5 p.m. Be there by 4:30 so he can brief you on what to say. That's what he wants. Check if the girl's been sexually molested. Sure. Listen, Danny, I'm sorry to put you through this. I know you had enough with this fucking guy. Apparently not enough. You know the nice thing about it? It allows them to feel it's not a sin to be the victim of a sociopath. I can guess why you called. I saw the TV. You think he's back, don't you? - Yeah. - I know. - Do you think he died in the crash? - I prayed he did. When they told me they couldn't find his body, something inside me knew nothing so evil could die so easily. Terrifying, isn't it? I remember all those stories about you capturing Simon and then denying you'd done anything heroic at all. - I believed you. - You were one of the few. Christ, he must have scared the shit out of you. Yeah. You know, why do men have such a hard time communicating? Expressing fear? There's nothing wrong in being afraid, O'Brien. You came up against a monster and he beat you. That's heavy shit. - Why doesn't he rape them? - It's not sexual with him. - He just loves to kill. - Why just women? I have my theory he was abused as a child, probably even sexually, by his mother. Killing all those women, that's his way of getting back at her. There's one thing I know for sure, though. I gave him every test imaginable and they all came up zero. He's got no thought processes. It's all pure instinct. So he sees something he likes, kills it and takes it home. That's about it. I'm sorry I couldn't be more help. - Yeah. Well, thanks for your time, Doc. - Yeah. Listen, one thing. Don't forget, Simon's an animal. And like all the animals, he's got to have a place to hide, some place he feels protected where he can play with his victims. Let's say for a minute you're right about that fear stuff. How do you shake it? Don't even try. We all got demons. Just live with it. Hey, Doc. What if you can't? What other choice you got? - What is this? - Hi, how's it going? Great. I am having the greatest day. I know I've told you this before, but if you want to make any changes around the house, go ahead and do it. Honey, how sweet of you. I hadn't thought of that. The crib came. It is so adorable. I can't wait for you to see it. - How's your day going? - Fine. Any pains or anything? Only from your daughter using my bladder as a punching bag all day. She just wants out, that's all. I've got to go. Get some rest for this evening. - OK. Hurry home. - Love you. I love you too, a lot. Bye. - Do you want to go for a ride? - No, thanks. Fine. - Dwight! You scared the shit out of me! - Scared the shit out of you? - Where've you been anyway? - All hell broke loose at the precinct. Some reverend's running around screaming about his missing kid. Guess where she was last seen. At the Wiltern. - Can't you give us some details? - Hero, is the Terror back? - The public have a right to know. - We've always been good to you. - We can't keep them waiting. - Give him a break. - Where is he, Sal? - Hi, Danny. Go right in. Jesus Christ, O'Brien, where the hell have you been? Harriet, tell them we'll be out in a minute. You are done. Of course, you know everyone here. As you can guess, the press is driving me nuts with all this Simon Moon crap. Since you caught him, I need you to go out there and tell them that this starlet stuff is not his work. - I can't do that. - And why the hell not? Because I think he's back. Come on, O'Brien, you can't be serious. There's only been one killing. The police haven't established a thing. - You asked for my opinion, you got it. - Based on what? - On my observation of the body. - That's it? And the disappearance of a girl. Both were last seen at the Wiltern Theater. - That proves zip. - Fine, then you go play meet the press. No, damn it. They want to hear from you. Danny, this is for you. I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor, but they said this is urgent. The lab report says the actress wasn't sexually molested. There's no doubt in my mind. It's Simon Moon. You told me this morn... You said he was dead. - I said "supposed to be dead". - If he survived. He's a lunatic. He wouldn't wait this long to strike again. Who says he's waited? He's probably got a play-pen full of corpses. Then why was that actress left in the park? Because he didn't like her. Who knows? Maybe in his sick mind, she didn't fit in. I don't know. You are painting a very depressing scenario, O'Brien. I'll paint one you'll like even less. A few months ago, Moon slips back into LA. Wet. Hurt. Looking for some place to hide. He stumbles across the Wiltern Theater. Deserted. Boarded up. Just like Sinbad's. He finds a way in. He sets up house. He just gets settled. And what happens? You, Mr. Mayor, decide to blow 14 million bucks sprucing up his house, throw open the doors and invite the whole city right into the bastard's living room. How's that one? Mr. Mayor, please, they're waiting. Damn it, Harriet. In a minute. OK. All right. Look. We've got to come to some accord on this, O'Brien. If the English translation for accord is "we lie", I pass. Are you one of those cops who think that all politicians care about are votes? - We all have our priorities. - What do you think are my priorities? 14 million and your renovation project. Well, you're full of shit! Goddammit O'Brien. That's the mayor you're talking to. If it would save a single life, I'd burn that theater to the ground tomorrow. I'm not concerned about money, I'm concerned about copycats. Three years ago, Simon Moon slaughtered 22 women, but 12 more were killed by wackos trying to grab a headline. So if, and I say if you're right, if that maniac is back again, this time I propose that we isolate him. Tell the world he's dead. Keep the blood on his hands. Keep those loonies off the streets. It's a plan to save lives, O'Brien. And I don't need your half-assed moralizing. I need your help. - All right. On one condition. - What's that? We station an officer at the Wiltern Theater. - You got it. - Mr. Mayor. All right! All right. Let's get this damn thing over with. Come on. Mayor Bronson has been joined by his assistant Sal Copelli and Detective Danny O'Brien at this afternoon's press conference. Of great concern, is Simon Moon, or the Terror as he's sometimes called, back in Los Angeles? Let's open the floor for general questions. Well, goodness, one at a time. Mary Lou from The Times. There are persistent rumors that the actress found early this morning near the Wiltern Theater was a victim of Simon Moon, the Terror. Is this true? As most of you know, I've invited Detective Danny O'Brien in on this case. I haven't had a chance to discuss his findings with him yet. So why don't I just call Detective O'Brien up here, and we’ll learn the answers to these questions together? Detective O'Brien. Did you see the body, Detective O'Brien? Is it Simon Moon? Was it him who killed that girl at the Wiltern? No. - Is that it? - Yes. Your mom called today to wish me happy birthday. That's nice. This is really sweet of you. I'm excited about tonight. You know, you were right about this place, Danny. There's not enough room for everything. I told you. OK, so tell me how I look. Please choose your words carefully. You look great. I mean, you really look good. If you like big. We better go. Is that your press conference? I haven't had a chance to discuss his findings with him yet. So why don't I just call Detective O'Brien up here, and we'll learn the answers to these questions together? Detective O'Brien. Did you see the body, Detective O'Brien? Is it Simon Moon? Was it him who killed that girl at the Wiltern? No. - Is that it? - Yes. You have a wonderful way with words. So we get the official word from a man who ought to know, Detective Dan O'Brien, who, you may recall, nearly three years ago earned the nickname Hero, when he single-handedly apprehended Simon Moon, also known as the Terror. I'm Tiu Leek reporting live for Channel Five. Now back to the studio. I wish they'd stop that Hero crap. People need heroes. They picked you. Why are you letting it bother you so much? Because it's making me out to be something I'm not. You earned that nickname 100 times since then and everybody knows it. Now let's drop it or I'm not going out to dinner. I refuse to spend the evening listening to my future husband put himself down. You're a feisty little beggar for someone so pregnant. You know us Welsh. - Good evening. - Hello. It's a little hard for me. Thank you very much. - Thank you. - No problem. - What do you think? - Very impressive. That's the whole idea. - Good evening. - Good evening. - O'Brien. - Mr. O'Brien, of course. - Good evening, madame. - Good evening. Your table is ready for you, sir. Please follow me. Excuse me. Sir, excuse me. The lady. A little bit more, please. Please, madame. Just a little bit more, please. Thanks. - Sorry. - Sorry. Sorry. - Enjoy your dinner. - Thank you. - Have a pleasant evening, sir. - Thank you. - Like them? - Oh, Danny. Oh, they're beautiful. Read the card. "I love you. A secret admirer." A secret admirer? Whoever he is, he's ordered champagne, too. Well, I guess my secret admirer forgot that I shouldn't have champagne in my condition. - That's right, I'm sorry... - I'll have a sip. Happy birthday, honey. Hi, stranger. You look great. You OK? I'm fat, ugly and getting old. Other than that, I'm terrific. Honey, you're pregnant. You're supposed to be fat. But you look awful beautiful. Honest. Thank you. Well, let's order. I always feel better with food. Thank you. - Honey, that was a great meal. - It's not over yet. Oh, look! Aw! Birthdays come but once each year So we send this message clear Happy birthday, Kay, my dear Happy birthday till next year - Happy birthday! - Happy birthday! OK, make a wish. What are you looking at? The sprinklers. I know they're gonna go off any minute. Come on, honey. Make a wish. Blow out the candles. Could you ask them to take this away, please? - You don't like it? - Honey, I love it. It's me I don't like. I'm just feeling very confused. I never thought I could feel this confused. I'm a shrink, for Christ's sake. Come on, honey. Blow out the candles. Make a wish, though. I wish I wasn't feeling so confused, that's what I wish. I wish... I wish I hadn't given up my cozy little apartment. That was my independence. I wish I hadn't taken a sabbatical. I think I really need to work, Danny, don't you? I wish I could turn the calendar back, but I can't. I wish I wasn't 36. But I am. I wish I didn't have to worry so much if this kid was gonna be normal. And I wish I didn't look like the Goodyear blimp. That's a lot of wishes for one birthday. Everything will be fine, I promise. - You promise? - Cross my heart. - I'm hungry again. - You're always hungry. I'm so glad they didn't do the typical LA number and tear this place down. - Look at that. Isn't that beautiful? - Yeah, it is. We won't be here long. I've just got to talk to Bill for a second. A guy and a girl, and me and a ghetto blaster. You figure it out 'cause I sure can't. - Hiya. - It's good to see you. You, too, dear. You are the most beautiful pregnant lady I have ever seen. You say that to all the pregnant ladies. No. Normally I run when I see one. No, I'm not gonna hug you. The last time, you almost strangled me. I want you to meet George Dankis, the manager here. - How do you do? - Hello. I hear I have you to thank for this overtime. Don't thank me. I just asked for the dumbest guy they knew. - They sent you. - Kay, how do you put up with this guy? - Not easily. - I understand. - Anyone care for coffee? - Not me. How about you? I'd like some water, if that's all right. Certainly. Right this way. Excuse us please. Let's take a walk. OK. - What's up? - We're looking for Simon Moon. Simon Moon! What makes you think he's gonna show up here? I don't think he’ll show up here. I think he is here. And how do you know that? - Just a feeling. - When was it built? It was completed in 1931. I'm very happy for you. - Thank you. - My wife had a C-section. But she sailed through it. The baby looks like an angel. Nothing like me. - I've a photo if you'd like to see. - Sure. I was hoping you'd ask. There she is. - Isn't she a beauty? - What a beautiful baby. All babies are beautiful. Your baby's gonna be beautiful, too. Excuse me a second. Y'ello. Manager. No. You were supposed to... Weren't you supposed to be...? - Excuse me. Ladies' room? - Upstairs to the right. My friend, you mean to tell me I'm missing a warm bed and a hot body just because of a feeling? If you don't like it, I can replace you real quick. Take it easy, Dan, I'm just joking. And I want you to take this assignment goddamn seriously. All right, I will. I will, I promise. OK. Buzz me if you hear anything. - Yeah, right. - I mean, anything. The slightest noise. OK. Huh? Kay... what the hell? Oh. - This is no time for... - Where's Kay? She went to the ladies' room right there. Tell me you'll be here... Oh! Ah! - Do you have to go to the bathroom? - Yes. - Do you mind if I go in with you? - Danny... - I'll wait by the door, then. - I'll just wait till I get home, then. OK. - Are you gonna tell me what's going on? - What do you mean? You're acting weird. I'm acting weird? I didn't throw my birthday cake at the waiter. I didn't do that. No, but you were thinking it. I could see it in your eyes. - My wife's father owns the theater. - Figures. - Do you have a spare key to this place? - Oh, yeah. Remember, if you hear anything, Bill... Take this guy home. - There you go. - All right, we're going. - Good night. - Good night. Should I leave all the lights on just in case or just the work lights? Work lights'll be fine. - What kind of music do you dig? - Mozart. - Mozart? Well, good night. - Good night. This is about Simon Moon, isn't it? Do you want to... Do you want to tell me about it? Yeah. - Uh! - You OK? Aah! Oh, Danny! Oh, shit! Breathe, honey, breathe. Attagirl. That's it. There you go. Breathe, now. Breathe. OK, I think they're about five minutes apart. Let's just be careful. Let's relax. - OK, we're at the hospital. - Stay calm, stay calm. - Danny. Danny. - Where in the hell is everybody? - Danny, I'm gonna need some help. - Damn it! OK. Easy. OK. Easy. Stay calm. OK. We're here. Breathe. They're three minutes apart. We're expecting a baby. Call the doctor. - What's the doctor's name? - Dr... - Just stay calm. - Dr... - It's a woman. Dr... - Haskins. - ...Haskins. - They're starting again. Oh... I will never do this again! - Dr. Haskins, please. - Breathe. - What's the patient's name, please? - O'Brien... I mean Kay Kennedy. I have your patient here, a Mrs. Kennedy. Yes, she's in active labor now. - Breathe. - Thank you. - She's on her way, sir. - OK. Breathe. Breathe. Danny! - Where's the doctor? - She'll be here soon. - Where does she live? New Jersey? - Calm down. She's on her way. Hold her hand. Tell her how proud you are. Honey, I'm so proud of you, so proud. - It’ll be over before you know it. - Easy. Don't rub her skin off. What is this shit? OK, my friend. Look, I'm sorry, OK? I didn't expect anybody to be here. Just thought I'd come in and sneak in and get a workout. Without disturbing anyone, you know what I mean? Hey, look now. I don't want no trouble and I know you don't. I hope you don't. So let me just get my gear, OK? You and I, we can call it a draw and I'll just leave you alone in this place and nobody'll bother you, OK? Dan, hold her head. She's beautiful. My two beautiful ladies. - Born on the same day. - Dan, hold her head. - What do you think of Angela? - Angela? Angela. Dan, Kay needs some rest now. You go home, relax, get some sleep. I'll just get some coffee. It's all right. Go on home. I'll be fine. I'm not tired, really. I feel fine. - Hello, Bill. - Danny, it's Dwight. Come and take a look at this. I got something you should see. Danny, I'm sorry. Did you check the theater? Bridges has an army of his men in there now. Danny, they found his shoulder holster draped over a seat. Come on, guys, let's bring him in. Oh, God. Why didn't you listen? Nothing. There's nothing there. The whole goddamn theater is empty. I've got all the men searching the neighbourhood now. - Check the theater again. - We've checked it from top to bottom. - Now check from bottom to top. - Oh, shit! - Come on, let's go get the men. - All right, everybody back in. Everybody through there again, let's go. - Right. Somebody hit the lights. - I got 'em. - Right. Get every seat up flat. - Let's go. What's up, Danny? - Keep your eyes sharp. - Come on, you guys, let's go. Jim, Todd, you guys look over there. Let me borrow that. Oh, shit. - Want me to go with you? - No, wait here. Ah! Never mind. Over there to the right. Then the center. Check those exit doors. Hand me a flashlight over here. Here you go. Be careful. Careful. I want you to search these bins in here, yeah? I’ll take the other officer. You follow me. Danny? Check every cubby hole and niche, OK? - See this up here? - Careful. If you see something, just holler. - See anything? - Nothing yet. Careful. Careful. - Did you check those out? - No, not yet. - I'll take a look. - All right. - Are you gonna stay up there all day? - Yeah. The view's great. Watch out. Watch out. - Send me some light this way, will you? - Hold this. - Watch your ass, O'Brien. - Tell me about it. No, you go. I'm afraid of heights. - Find anything? - Nothing. You know, you think you get used to this stuff. Hey, good night, partner. Don't worry, buddy. We'll get him. Listen, one thing. Don't forget, Simon's an animal. Like all animals, he needs some place to hide, where he can feel protected and play with his victims. Danny, this is all we've got left on the Wiltern. Thanks. There you are, you son of a bitch. She looks like you, doesn't she? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. What's wrong, Danny? I know where he is. You found Simon Moon? Do you have to go? That was a stupid question. You're right. Angela is a beautiful name. I love you. Yeah. Dwight. - Yeah. - Dwight. It's me. Danny, where are you? - I'm on my way to the Wiltern. - Not again. - He's there. - Who's there? - Simon Moon. - What? There's a room upstairs. It was a prop room during vaudeville days. It's been plastered over for years. I'll meet you there in half an hour. Yeah, sure. Right away. Danny, you wait there, OK? You wait for your backup. Danny! Come on! Let's move it! Let's move it! Danny! Danny! - Jesus! - Don't touch anything. You all right? You gotta get to a hospital. We don't need an ambulance. We need a coroner. Yeah, you're right. Oh, Danny. I do. I do.
