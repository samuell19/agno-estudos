HELP! HELP! HELP! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!! NO! Oh baby! That looks heavy. Let me lighten the load. Thank you. That two ounces really helps. You're welcome. We could've paid somebody to do this for us, you know? Yeah, but I'm kind of liking having you all to myself. Yeah? Want a hand? No, no I got it. You know, I do think there might be better ways to spend your day off. Do you think? I think I can... Woah! Oh Go... Are you okay? Yeah, what did I ruin? Christmas, a lot of Christmas. Well, I am just glad to see we're not like an old married couple here. Well, so am I. Do you think we should have waited, you know, 'till things are sorted out? You know money's not an issue, baby. You know that's not what I mean, Mr. senior partner. I just want you to be happy. You deserve to be happy. There's something that I wanted to talk to you about. Okay. I just want you to keep an open mind, okay? Well, that doesn't sound good. I know it happened really fast. Listen, moving in here and all of that, I just... I'll turn it off. Okay. Let me take this. Yeah. Hey, baby. I have a secret to share. Where are you, babe? I just left the doctor's office. Is everything all right? Well, we're pregnant, Roy! We're finally pregnant! I thought we... I know, I know. The doctor sees this often with couples that've been trying for years; once they stop the pressure's off and voila, they get pregnant! Well that's... That's great news, baby. Well, you don't sound so sure? I'm just surprised. Good surprised or bad surprised? What was that? I'm just at the office. That was Marcie, she just dropped some plates. You haven't eaten, have you? I'm on my way to you now. Baby, why don't you go ahead, head to Bella's, grab us a table. Meet you there, all right? Roy, are you sure you're okay? You don't sound right. SARAH!!! SARAH!! So, how's she doing? Look, Roy, I've been looking after your family for a long time, so I'm going to be straight with you. It's been three months. Physically she's recovering just fine, but losing the baby the way she did, it's taken a heavy psychological toll. I've got to find a way to help her, doc. You need to get her out of the city. For Sarah, everything beyond that door is a reminder of what happened. Okay, you mean move out of the city. Yes Roy. Take her somewhere quiet, somewhere she can recover. Yeah. Yeah, maybe. I appreciate it, doc. You think about what I said now. I will. We'll see ya. Take care. Hi... What are you doing here? I'm sorry, I just wanted... Just stop! Stop it! Hi, my name is Sarah Payton, I called a few weeks ago. I'd like to set up an appointment with one of your investigators. You can't come to my house, Dianne. Are you crazy? It's not my house. Left me no choice. You're not answering my phone calls. I'm not going to answer your calls. It's over. I can't answer you... It doesn't have to be like this. Yes... it does have to be like this. Listen to me, I did something I can never take back. I'm sorry you had to be a part of it. I'm truly... I'm truly sorry that I hurt you. But I went to Sarah to do everything in my power... No! You don't love her! Just stop! I do love her, Dianne. I love Sarah. Roy, you got me out of a horrible relationship once. Let me... Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't touch me... Stop it. Please, Dianne I'm just trying to do what's right. I've already signed over the apartment to you so... I don't want the apartment, Roy. I just want you. Yeah listen to me, Dianne... No. You're not listening. We're good together, Roy. I have to find a way to make you see that. You don't have to find a way to make... You don't have to find a way to do anything, Dianne. For Christ's sake. 56 and Park, please. Hey, are you okay? Yeah, I just got a little light-headed and knocked the vase off the table, no big deal. Well, it is a big deal if you hurt yourself. Hey, a woman called looking for you earlier. What'd she want? Dunno, she wouldn't say, all very... mysterious. Did she leave any info? Yeah. It's right next to the phone. I told her you wouldn't be home until after six. So I guess my secret's been exposed, huh? Well, I certainly have some questions. Just hear me out, please. Just hear me out. Sit down. Sit down on the couch. What would you think about getting out of the city, maybe to Cold Spring? The little town upstate that we broke down on our honeymoon? Yeah. You loved it, right? Yeah I did, I do. Yeah, it would be nice to get away for a few days. Well, what if it wasn't for a few days? What if we actually moved there? What about your job, the law firm... Well that's one little conversation I need to have with you. I've actually taken a leave of absence. Comes into effect today. Wow. Can we afford to do this? We can. Honey, we can. And more importantly, I think we need to do this, for us. This is a list of homes for sale. There's not a lot, but you definitely do get a lot of bang for your buck. Every one of them has a lot of character... I know. What? I know which one. Look at this it's amazing. Look at this one. Yeah, yeah. Yeah I... I thought the same thing when I saw it. Should I call her? Yeah... yeah. I'll call her right now. There we have it. I can't tell you how pleased we are you've decided to restore the property. Progress has a way of erasing small towns like ours. Yeah. We like the house pretty much exactly the way it is. Sometimes I think we're too quick to get rid of the things in life that get old. We lose sight of exactly how special they are. There are two sets of keys. I will leave them right there. I didn't introduce myself. Tess Burrows, I'm the lawyer that handled the sale. Pleasure. Oh, well, thank you so much for doing this on a Sunday. I'm surprised Lisa didn't show up, actually. Roy said she was one of the best agents he's ever worked with. I'm afraid she's been involved in an accident. Is she okay? Unfortunately... She died? She just had a baby this past winter. It was a car wreck. It's odd because she grew up in Cold Spring. We all know to slow down around that bend and... I'm sorry, this is a happy day for the two of you, and I'm putting a damper on it. No, it's, it's... I think it's time I get out of your hair. It's okay. I have the final paperwork back in the car. I'll walk you to the car. So swing back by. Okay. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Take care. Thanks. Hey, what was that all about? She's got a small law firm, found out I'm a lawyer and said she'd work for me, if you can believe it. So I think I'll uh... I'll stop by her office tomorrow. That's great, babe. Yeah... yeah. Roy. Roy. Roy? Roy! STAB Hey... What, what, what, what?? Sarah? What? What? What? What is it? What? Baby, what? What? What? What? Hey, hey, hey, hey? It's okay. There, uh... There was a boy. There was a boy in here. No. Baby there's nobody. There's no one. Hey, hey, hey. You okay? Yeah, I just thought the nightmares were over, doc. You know? She just seemed to be doing so well. Was there a trigger of any kind? Something that would have stirred up the emotions surrounding the accident? Yeah. Yeah, I can't believe I didn't remember, we just heard that our real estate agent died in a car wreck a few days ago. I can see where that would have a big impact on Sarah. Think I should take her to see someone, doc? I would give it a few days. Sarah probably feels, to some degree, responsible for the loss of the baby. I'm no expert, but I would say the nightmares are her way of dealing with that guilt. Yeah. And if the nightmares continue? Then, Sarah is going to need some help, and from somebody far better suited than I. Yeah... yeah. Think I should bring her back to the city? No, I think it's best you stay put. Let me make some calls, see if there's somebody up your way who can check on her. Yeah, I appreciate it, doc. I do. Give me a call tomorrow and let me know how her night goes. Yeah, will do. THUMP Hey, buddy! Watch it, man! Sorry. Oak Grove Inn. Hi, yeah, I was supposed to meet a friend there today for lunch and I forgot her room number. Her name is Dianne Hunter. I'm sorry sir, we can't give out guest information. No, I understand, any way you can just ring her room for me please? One moment, please. I appreciate it. Sir, I'm afraid we don't have anyone staying here by that name. Are you sure? I'm almost positive she... Sorry sir. I've checked twice and we don't have anyone registered by that name. Okay, okay, thank you. Uh, pardon me. Mr. Payton? Sorry, do we know each other? Is there somewhere maybe that we could go and talk? Right here should be fine. Okay, you don't know me so I don't expect you to believe what I'm saying, but that doesn't change the fact that everything I'm about to tell you is true. Your wife is in great danger and you need to get her out of Cold Spring. Now. Did Dianne put you up to this? No, Mr. Payton... Did Dianne put... Tell her to stay the hell away from me, you understand me? You tell her that. The nightmares are just beginning. Things are going to get much worse. If you or Dianne come anywhere near me, my family, my house, I will call the police! You make sure she understands that! If you change your mind, my name is Erin Potts. You can do this. You can do this. Excuse me? Ms. Burrows. Tess, Roy Payton. Hey. Nice. Well, it looks like you've got your hands full here. Third alternator since I bought her back in law school. Wouldn't it be cheaper just to have a mechanic do the work? Right now every penny counts. Know what? Can give me a hand a minute? Yeah, sure. Happy to help. So business is slow, eh? Well, business has been better. But I do have this one opportunity, if you're game. This big box company wants to move into the brickyard and the locals want a corporate lawyer, but I don't have any corporate law experience. So that's where I come in. So, what do you say, do you want to fight the good fight? Yeah, sounds good. Maybe tomorrow we can look over the case and talk finances? Absolutely, sounds good. You sure you have this bolt tight enough? Heh, go. Home to your wife. I'll manage this fine. There you go. Talk to you tomorrow. Yeah. Hey it's Dianne, leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as I can. Hey it's Dianne, leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as I can. I saw you, okay? I know you're here. This thing has gone way too far. You need to stop it right now, understand me? There is no 'us'. There never will be. So turn around, go back home, and get on with your life. Please. Excuse me. I need some goat cheese. There's six different types of goat cheese back there. Do you guys have anything, like, plain goat cheese? This should do it. Thank you. Yeah, don't mention it. Excuse me, sorry to bother you again, but parsnips... that's a vegetable, right? Here you go, four parsnips. They just look like white carrots, eh? Yeah, pretty much. Well thank you very much. And one more thing, if you don't mind, if you have a moment? You'd best follow me, or I'll never get any studying done. So you're not from around here, are you? Uh no, New York, actually. Just moved here, though. Why the hell would you do that? I'm just trying to make a new start, I guess. Are you hiding from something? No. No, I'm not. I'm just, uh, trying to put some stuff behind me, you know? Well, that about does it. Yeah? Yep. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it. So, what are you studying there? Oh, Pre Law. I'm taking an online course. I'm getting into school next year. Well, as luck would have it, I'm a lawyer. When you're ready to apply, I'll make some calls for you. You would do that for me? Of course. If it weren't for you I'd still be standing at the cheese counter. Wouldn't want to lose it, right? Yeah, right. Babe, I'm home! Sarah? Sarah?! Sarah?! Sarah? Sarah? Sarah? SARAH?! I didn't realize somebody was still in here. THUMP Sarah? Sarah?! What's all the yelling about? Hey. Hey. Wow, that's quite the reception. I should go for a walk more often. You all right? Yeah. There's broken glass, there's blood on the blanket. Oh, yeah. I got a nosebleed. Baby, you really scared me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, babe. I should've left a note or something. Please, next time. Baby? It's okay, it's okay. Go back to sleep. Sarah? Sarah! Baby, baby? Baby, baby, baby. Sarah! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay. Hey, we're good we're good. The boy, the boy... No, no, no, no, no, no. He broke the glass! There's no boy. No he broke the glass and he... Shhhh! There's no boy. It was just a nightmare, baby. It was a nightmare. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I really feel I should be staying home today. I'm fine, Roy. Look. It's no big deal. Why don't you come with me, then? No, no. Go. Go. All right. What are you going to do? Well, I'll probably take a walk. Don't worry, I'll be back before dark. All right. But keep your phone with you, will you please? I will, cross my heart, hope to die. Don't say that. It was a joke, Roy. It was a joke. Just don't say it, please? I won't be long. You're a terrible liar. Pft. I know. Excuse me. Pardon me. Ex... What-what-what happened here? I just uh... Mr. Payton? I was hoping to see you at the station yesterday. Didn't you get my note? Uh, I did, sir. Sorry, but my wife is not well and I just... really needed to focus on the family. Hopefully there's nothing stopping you from coming by this afternoon. Do you mind if I ask what this is in reference to? It seems you were the last person to see Lisa Hill alive, before her car accident. So we just have some questions, pretty standard stuff. Yeah. So what happened here? It's a hell of a thing. Some son-of-a-bitch broke in last night after she closed the shop and beat her to death. We didn't find the body until this morning. She lived alone. I've known this girl my entire life. I hope to God I'm the first one to find the bastard who did this. Robbery, or... Yeah that's what we thought. Just some of her personal items were taken. But they didn't take anything from the register so I'd say that makes it personal, wouldn't you? Did you know Angela? No, no. I uh... she helped me in the store one time before, but I wouldn't say I knew her. Oh. Very good, very good. All right, everybody, that's enough. Let's show some respect. Go about your business please. Come on this isn't helping Angela, anybody. Go about your business please. Show's over. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me? Uh... I don't know if this means anything, but I actually gave Angela my card. The other day she was helping me, she was applying to law school, I offered to make some calls. Mighty generous of you for a girl you just met. It wasn't long ago I was applying to law school. It can be quite the endeavor to get accepted. Just a spur of the moment thing. I just... Looks like you weren't the only person to get caught up in the spur of the moment last night. See you this afternoon, Mr. Payton. Please don't forget. Yeah... Tess? Tess? Tess?! Ah. Aah! Aaah! THUD Hello, you've reached Roy Payton. Please leave a message at the tone. Baby, this has gotta be the 6th or 7th time I've called. Just please call me back and tell me what's going on? Oh, never mind, I hear your car. Can I help you? My name is Erin Potts, did your husband happen to mention me? What is this about, exactly? I spoke to your husband yesterday, but I'm afraid he wasn't ready to hear what I had to say. So... I'm sorry can I just come in for a moment? My husband'll be home in a few minutes, you can talk then. It's extremely important that we talk. You need to leave right now, or I'm calling the police. You're in an incredible amount of danger, Mrs. Payton. Please! It's ringing. I know about your accident. I know that you lost your child. How do you know that? I just want to help you. Thank you. And it's only been since you moved here? Started the very first night. The carvings, he's trying to tell you something. He's trying to communicate. They're just... lines. To us. Not to a boy. You talk like he's real. He doesn't feel real to you? So the choking and... the stabbing, that's him trying to tell me something too? He's trying to make sure he has your undivided attention. So how does this work, exactly? Your guess is as good as mine, to be honest. But... you said that you could... help. Yes. I do pick up on strong, very strong, emotions. But usually, I just feel them. But sometimes, if the feeling's strong enough then... I'll see it as well. Like my nightmares? I have never experienced the level of emotional turmoil, that I have gone through in the last couple of days. And I can't say that I know where the storm is coming from, but I do know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it's heading directly towards you. I've been trying to call you. Yeah. Baby? Ah, Mr. Payton. You didn't make it in again today. So, I thought I would just come by instead. There's a few things that I want to clear up, if you don't mind? Yeah. Yeah sure. Where were you last night between six and nine PM? He was with me. Of course he was. And me. They were kind enough to have me over for dinner last night. What is this about, exactly? You sure you don't want to talk in private? No, I have nothing to hide. Well, we all have something to hide, Mr. Payton. We all have our secrets. Okay, you know what? If you've got questions just get this over with, if that's all right with you. All right. So the passed week, two women have been killed in this town and you seem to be the last person to have seen them alive. Lisa Hill, your realtor and Angela, the girl that helped you at the grocery. Well, Lisa was killed in a car accident. Yeah that's what we thought, until the medical examiner discovered she'd been bludgeoned to death and placed in the car after she died. Okay, just stop it. Just stop it, will you? I had nothing to do with the deaths of those girls and you know it. So just stop it. Are you sure you don't want to talk in private? I think I was fairly clear. I have nothing to hide here. Well, you said you gave Angela your business card. Yeah, I gave her my card. She was applying to law school; I offered to make some calls. There a problem with that? That's it, nothing else? I wrote my phone number on this card. Everything else was added by somebody else. I wrote my phone number and that's it, you understand me? So you didn't hit on her, you didn't have a room at the Oak Grove Inn? First of all, I resent the implication. I was in the store, she helped me locate some items, I was offering to return the favor, that's it. See that's odd, 'cause there's a room there, room number eleven at the Oak Grove Inn, registered in your name. And we have witnesses who can put you there yesterday afternoon. Is that true? No. No, honey it's not true. I didn't hit on anybody, nor was I registered at the inn. It never happened. Was I there? Yes, I was there. I didn't even go in. Who were you looking for? Christ sake... Who were you looking for? Dianne. I have reason to believe she's behind this and actively trying to implicate me. And why, exactly, would she want to frame you for murder? Baby, I am so sorry. From the bottom of my heart, I am so sorry. I had an affair in New York. I broke it off three months ago and she's not happy about it. I saw her yesterday; I saw her walking into the motel. I called the front desk; they have no recollection of anybody staying there by that last name. This morning I saw her outside the grocery store; she was standing there in the crowd just... smiling at me. Why didn't you say anything to me then? Because it's bizarre to me, all right? Because I can't comprehend how she would do something like this. And you think I did something like this, and left a trail pointing directly to me... I'm an attorney, I know exactly how this works. If I had it my way I'd arrest you right now. But I need an okay from the judge, I won't have that till morning, so... Yeah, sure you would. We'll check out your, uh, 'Dianne Hunter'. And in the meantime don't leave town. I'm gonna leave you two, you've got a lot to talk about. If there's anything else you think of that you might want to add... And as for you, Ms. Potts, I hope you know what you've gotten involved in. Get the car. Mr. Payton, I'm sure I don't need to tell you this, but you should get yourself a lawyer. Baby. Baby, baby. Baby, Sarah? Sarah! I should go. First of all, what the hell are you doing here? Second of all, what did you tell my wife? Maybe you should talk to her. Just... uh, just sit down and wait here, all right? Let me sort this out. Just sit down. Baby? Sarah? Baby, I am so sorry. About everything. Please say something. Scream, yell, just... Please say something, honey. I knew about Dianne. I saw her that day she came to the house. But you never said anything. I wanted to move on with our lives as much as you did. So I let it go. I forgave you, for us. I never loved her, Sarah. I swear to God I never loved her. Just, please. What else are you hiding from me? I went to see Tess and she was dead, Sarah. She'd killed her like an animal, it was... Take off your shirt. What are you... Just take your shirt off, give me your shirt. Give it to me. Sarah? Sarah, where are you going? Sarah wait. Sarah! Please. You lied to the police about being here last night. Why? Because if your husband is telling the truth, and I feel he is, then what's happening in Cold Springs is tied to the boy in your nightmare... Stop it! Stop it. Dianne Hunter's what's happening at Cold Springs, all right? How the hell's that tied to Sarah's nightmares? I don't know yet. But I suggest we figure it out before something awful happens to your wife. Sarah please, please let's just go. I'm not running from this, okay? Look, Roy, I'm sorry, leave if you have to. But if Erin thinks she can help me, I'm staying. You... you better know what the hell you're talking about. Last time you let your fear drive you from your dream. This time I need you to fight your fear and stay with the boy, no matter what. Is that dangerous? No. You can't get hurt in there. And we'll be out here to make sure that you don't hurt yourself. Okay. I'm scared. I'm not going to let anything happen to you. I'm going to go make sure everything's locked up. Hey, buddy! She's asleep. Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right up. Sarah! Dianne's outside, she's trying to get in. No, we need to see her through this. What's wrong with her? We need to see what the boy wants. What is... Sarah! We need to see what the boy wants! Sarah, Sarah! We've gotta wake her up. Sarah? Sarah! SMACK THUMP! Sarah? Sarah? SARAH!! Sarah?! Sarah? Mr. Payton. Open the door, or we're coming in on our own. We have a warrant. Roy, open the door or we will come in on our own. We have a warrant. That's not necessary, just put the gun away. Put the gun away. Put the gun away. Mr. Payton, I imagine you know why we're here. It doesn't have to go down this way, Mr. Payton. I need you to listen to me. She has my wife. Who? Who has your wife? Dianne Hunter has my wife!!! That's impossible, Dianne Hunter is dead. She died. She died three months ago. She was mugged near your house in New York. That's... not possible. She... Stay calm; I'm going to reach into my pocket. I want to show you something, okay? We have the prints, the blood type, dental records. There's no questioning it, this is Diane Hunter. It's over, Roy. It's over. We know it was you. No that's... From the garage, you parked your BMW in New York, the front end smashed in and it still has Lisa Hill's blood on it. It's over, Roy. It's not possible! We found Tess in her vehicle with your fingerprints all over the trunk. PUT IT DOWN!! Put it down! Stand down! Put the weapon... PUT IT DOWN NOW!!! Down! NOW!!! You see? See, we're doing what you want, right? TAKE OUT YOUR HANDCUFFS NOW!!! Okay, okay. Put 'em on. This might buy you some time, but it's not gonna buy you your freedom. I don't care about my freedom. I just care about my wife. NOW YOU PUT THE CUFFS ON NOW!! Are you okay? Call every department within a fifty-mile radius and let them know we'll take whoever they can spare. And make sure they know he's armed and very dangerous. The dogs have picked up his scent. Shouldn't be long now. Good. Chief Upland! You need to have a look up here! Sir. This is unforgivable. All right, let's get the word out. Sarah Payton may still be alive! You were leading me to him. HELP!! HELP! Somebody help me!!! Please! HELP! WAHH! What do you want? What do you want? You can scream all you want out here, no one's gonna hear you. What do you want? Why are you doing this? What do you want? What... What are you doing? You know, if you would have just... Died in the beginning it would have been so much easier! Died? When? What're you talking about? I don't know what you're talking about! When I pushed you. I don't understand. You see... You see, if you would have just died when you were supposed to then none of this would have needed to happen. I don't understand. You don't understand? Your husband took what was mine. So I was going to take what was his. No. But, instead, you lived and she died! Your husband must have really loved you to do what he did, No, you don't have to... Killing Dianne just to save his precious little lamb... No! You've done enough! Please leave him alone! Just leave him alone! You see, the little lamb always hopes that the wolf will change, but once a wolf always a wolf. So I'm going to destroy your husband. Mhm. I'm going to destroy him and everything he loves. You don't understand!! Roy didn't kill Diane, I did. It was me. It was an accident, it was an accident. I didn't try to. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. It was an accident? I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry! IT WAS AN ACCIDENT?! Roy... What the hell is going on? Roy, you don't have much time. What are you doing here, Dianne? I want to help you. Trust me, please. CRASH! Looks like he's headed that way... He's not gonna pull any tricks, he's headed... They've got him! They got him! Where? They've got him surrounded in the old brick factory. HELP!! HELP! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!! Sarah?? HELP! HELP ME, HELP ME!! Keep talking, baby! I'm coming! Sarah? Don't come here, Roy! He's waiting for you! Sarah please, you got to answer me... If I lead you to me, he's going to kill you, Roy. Sarah! Sarah?! Sarah? He knows you're coming! Don't come! Roy please... I'm sorry! I love you. Sarah? Talk to me Sarah! Please! It's you, Frank. I know it's you, buddy. I know all about you. I've got it all right here, Frank. Assault and battery, assault with a deadly weapon. You know, Dianne said you were a real loser but I had no idea how right she was. Because it also says, right here Frank, that you had a child with Dianne. Would have been four years old, Frank. Would have celebrated his fourth birthday. If it weren't for the fact that you beat that child into a coma. It's you! Isn't that right, Frank? ISN'T THAT RIGHT, FRANK?! Frank! FRANK! WHERE ARE YOU, FRANK?? Sarah? ROY! What did you do to him? We must all reap what we sow in this life, Sarah. Ain't that right, Roy? Let her go, Frank. She has nothing to do with this. Nothing to do with this, huh? No! Stop it! Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it... Sarah, tell Roy what you did. Come here, come here, come here... I said, tell him what you did... OKAY! OKAY!! Okay, okay, okay. Dianne died because of me. Baby, she died because of me. And here, all long, I thought it was you. NO! Stop it! No please! Please stop, please stop... Baby, what's he talking about? Tell him. Sarah? Tell him what you told me. TELL HIM WHAT YOU TOLD ME! I am, I am, I am, I am, I am... Dianne is dead because of me. Uh, I'm sorry I must have the wrong address. Don't come back here again. That's right. I know who you are. What you are. Well, I guess I can tell you what I came here to tell Roy. What might that be? That he's here because he feels guilty, not because he's in love. When he realizes that, I'll be waiting. SMACK! Arrgh! I'm ending this once and for all, I'm calling the police! Call Roy instead, I'm sure he's had his fill of crazy! Get out of my house!! THUMP It all happened so fast. And then... I dragged her body into the alley. I took her purse and her phone, I wanted the police to think it was a mugging; I didn't know what to do, baby. I'm so sorry. I didn't know what to do. I took everything and I covered it up. I got rid of everything. It was an accident, Roy. It was an accident; I never meant to hurt her. I never meant to hurt her. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay... I never meant to hurt her. Because now the lamb has become the wolf. UGH! No... Sounds like we have company coming. My, what little tales we'll have to tell, huh? Huh, Roy?! Oh baby. Oh baby? That's it, Roy. Go ahead. Make a break for it, eh? I'll be right behind you. Frank... I think there's somebody here... that wants to talk to you, Frank. What the hell are you talking about? Don't you want to talk to me, Frank? Roy, no! You're not a murderer, Roy. You're the only one in this room that isn't. You shoot me, all these murders are going to stick to you. No Roy, no Roy. You've got a day, and so does Sarah's secrets. Do you know why the wolf eats the lamb, Roy? It's because he can. Roy, NO! Don't do it! BANG Drop the gun! I'm unarmed! Oh my God! Are you hurt? No! Somebody untie her, make sure there's nobody else. Okay. Stay on that. Roy! Roy! It was... It was Dianne Hunter's ex-husband. I tried to tell you, but you didn't listen. Chief, over here.

Looks like all the charges are gonna be dropped first thing in the morning. It's over. Yeah. He's... Mhmm? He... NURSE! NURSE!! He just... He just blinked, baby! Nurse!! Nurse! Hello? Mommy loves you. Do you think he's going to be happy with us? I think we're all gonna be much happier from here on out.
