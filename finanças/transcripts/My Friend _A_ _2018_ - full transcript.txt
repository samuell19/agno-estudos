Eien no Aidoru Everyone, listen up. Over here. These guys will work here this month, show them the ropes. Sure. Go ahead. I'm Masuda, pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you. They're Masuda-kun and Suzuki-kun. Please take care of them. Sure. Alright, thanks. Good work. Good work. They're not very energetic. Y u u z a i Are you okay? Please go left over there. Today, at about ten in the morning, the body of what appears to be an elementary schooler, stabbed multiple times, was found right behind where I am standing. The crime scene is in Saitama Prefecture, close to a highway. Here. Thank you very much. Don't expect to much of the dorm. There's nothing we can do about it. Masuda. I heard this from the boss, but you used to work for a newspaper? No, a magazine. Which one? I wanna hear a title. Shimizu-san collects magazines. Not really. It's nothing like that. I heard Suzuki has his welding licence. Our job is quite difficult. No one does it for long. Well, no one wants to do it for long either. It's bleak. Bleak? What? It's not just that. Please take care of us for this one month. Same for us, during that time. Shimizu-san, you're going for rice wine? I want kuromasu. [A public official working there reported the body of a man at the end of the tunnel to the police.] Shut up! I'll get the ice. [According to the police, he was murdered in the city, close to where he was found.] Want a drink? [It seems to be a elementary schooler who got lost on his way to school] Sure. It's about time to- Suzuki-kun, you have experience in jobs like this? You're pretty good at it. Me, not at all. A reporter. Isn't a job like that hard? Researching people you don't know. Is that why you quit? Good work today. Good work. I'm heading home. Good work. Thank you very much. Yamauchi-san! This is quite troublesome. He came late last night, saying he'd wait for you. What's with that? I'm very sorry. Everything okay? Kishigaki-san. Kishigaki-san, it's Yamauchi. It's the father of the murderer. Welcome back. Yes. Yamauchi-san, even if you run away, this will definitely catch up to you. I haven't run away. Please give me my child back. My child. I was wondering what you put in there. Nothing at all. Isn't it hot wearing that? Stop that already. Hey. Suzuki is avoiding us right? He is the first to leave in the morning, and isn't here in the evening either. That's true. Put something else on. It seems like something you'd do. Finding out what exactly he is. Oh, Suzuki. How about a game? Right now? We will be in trouble if you aren't there. Masuda will pay. Just 20 minutes. Let's go. Do you understand? Suzuki is hated. If you hang out with him, the same will happen to you. Isn't this bad? He's good. He has a mother complex? Proof he's a pervert. Taking one. What? Nothing. Manabu, you're no longer around. Right now, I'm the worst. No. I have been, from the time I first met you. cheating and easily scared. If Kazuki's parents had watched him a bit closer, he would have never done drugs. Kazuki-kun, how about you talk to everyone about what family means to you? Why do I have to talk to people who have nothing to do with me? For your own sake, and for theirs. For their sake? I don't care. Sit down! You! Damn! Damn it! Suzuki, you're slow. Do it more quickly. I'm not slow. I'm doing it. You think you can do the job, even though you just started recently? How impertinent. Bo-san. It really bothers me. Causing trouble. Stop that! Manabu Kazuki is bullied a lot. With a personality like that, it can't be helped. You're right. We have to do something for him. Yes. Shiraishi-sensei, do you have some time? Yes. It's about Aoyagi Kentaro. He lived close to the scene in Aichi, where a junior high school girl was torn apart. We've been asked for an alibi. He seemed to have disappeared from the factory. Do you know where he is now? You are supposed to be in charge of Aoyagi Kentaro. Is Aoyagi really adapting? If he were to commit another crime in these conditions, I have faith in him. You're really small. Shimizu-san. Shimizu-san. Shimizu-san? Don't mess with me! Don't make a fool of me. Let's leave it at this. Yes. Don't underestimate me. Don't underestimate me. Whatever. Don't mess with me. Shimizu-san. What? Even I know it. Masuda? Did you carry me? No. Suzuki did. Oh. Suzuki did? Thanks. No thanks. You always do this right? Even I It's your fault. My fault? I'm scared of things being made my fault. You're avoiding us, right? Not particularly. You're spending all your time outside, until we are sleeping. I'm just in the way, right? If I'm not around you can sleep and work. You're right. It helps a lot. I can spend my time in a net cafÃ© and such. I realized it when I saw your bag. It's full of daily necessities, like mine. But you'll probably be the one left behind. What do you mean? Is it my fault? You're similar to a classmate of mine, during junior high school. Not your face, but, how should I say this, your atmosphere. What kind of person were they? He committed suicide. How did you feel, at that time? Were you sad? Rather than being sad, I wondered why I couldn't save him. Is that why you have nightmares? Why did you quit being a reporter and start working here? That doesn't matter, right? Thinking you're smart, and better, different from everyone else. And because of that you're relaxed like a king. Are you okay with that? Would you be able to feel pain if I were to kill myself? Would you be able to feel sad? I would be sad. Of course I would be sad. You're lying. I don't know whether that is justice or not. I won't be happy even if you apologise. Then please let me at least hand you this. You really don't understand anything. We just want to forget. Remembering only brings us pain. Living on the compensation we got for our daughter. Thinking about that, it feels pathetic. Your name on the money transfers, it bring it back whenever I check my bank account. Your son, and your wife, who raised him. We will never forgive them. I'll come again. Just give up. Don't come any more. She was in her 4th year of elementary school. She didn't get to experience so many things. Because she died. I'm deeply sorry. You don't understand anything. You just want to end things for yourself. Don't you have any ideas? Can I ask for your name? I keep telling you this, but I called because the phone signalled it. Calm down. You should know that, right? I apologize. You're Fujisawa-san, right? Yes, that's right. Why do you say it like that? I know your name. Feel free to take any of Manabu's things. Sure. Sorry. Akita's mother told me by phone. You've become a reporter. It suits you. We left that town right away. But I'm glad I got to meet you in the end. The end? Please don't say that. You were Manabu's only friend after all. That's not true. You helped cover up that Manabu was bullied and watched over him till the end. That feels good. Please always be strong and righteous. Why? Minami Suzuko really saw you after all. I wanted to see you. You should just do as I say, and be a good girl. Breaking up with me, is not something you get to decide. Miyoko, I love you. I'm the only one who can cheer you up, right? Hey, don't watch us. So annoying, disappear to somewhere. What's with that? Who are you? I'm talking to you. Who are you? Can you hear me? Are you deaf? Get out of the way. This one only likes big penises. It's because she's had a pet bottle thrust into her all the time. She can't be happy with a regular penis. The police. Shall I call them? I'll punish women who betray me. Are you okay? Don't touch me. Sugimoto. Yes? What's going on with the murdered child in Saitama? No news? None at all. Please take a look at this. Boy A, Aoyagi Kentaro? It's a famous case, so you must know it. Yes. This is something for the prefectural police. It's probably nothing. But let's look into it. Yes. Please use this. I took her in the other day. So slow! Hurry up! If you don't hurry you pull us back. Shimizu, the president is calling you. Masuda. Please watch over this machine. You only have to watch it. Okay. Are you okay? You look bad. Be careful. My finger! Calm down. Calm down already! Ambulance. Hurry up, call an ambulance. Ambulance. Get a car ready! He's cut of the top of his fingers. Hold it together. You'll be fine. He got stuck in the machine. Bring him to Soko Hospital Just getting him there will be... Hurry. What are you doing? Hurry up! The car It's my responsibility, so I'm going with him. Hurry up! Are you okay? Hurry, this way. Come this way. To Soko Hospital. We'll pay if the seats get dirty. Watch your hand. Okay, okay. You're good. You're good. What? Here. Are you okay? Are you okay? Hang in there. Just a little longer. You should raise the wound above his heart, Raise it. Raise it. We're leaving right away. Thanks. Masuda. Let's go. Excuse me. Excuse me! Excuse me. Sir! Hold up! Sir! I arrived early so I played around. Thank you very much. You remembered where I lived. Sensei, there are all kinds of ways these days. I see. You know them well, Aoyagi-kun Everyone is looking for you. I went boating for the first time the other day. Have you ever done it? I haven't. I won. Shimizu-san and Utsuni-san said it was beginners luck. Shimizu-san and Utsuni-san work in the same factory as I do. On the way back I treated them to yakitori. That sounds like fun, Sensei, let's ride that. Where are you staying? I even made a friend, Masuda-kun. Tell me his contact information. Just tell me. I won't tell anyone else. I'm sorry I'm late. Are you okay? Yes. Just a little... Sorry. Just rest a little. Go greet father. Sure. Mother, he's just a child now. We don't even know if father knows. That was me being pretty strict. Really? Stay over, for at least today. Thank you. Sis, About the 3/2 division. Can't you do this later. I don't know when we'll meet. Sorry. If it's about that, Are you planning on having Tomoko inherit? Are you saying we should have nothing to do with her? That's not what he means. Taking care of mother, is pretty hard. Making you to shoulder everything must be very troublesome. It's fine. More importantly, come home a bit more. What happened to Masato? He's working in Hadano in Kanagawa. It was a traffic accident, right? Three children died. He didn't have licence. You guys are weird. Aren't those the times where a family should stick together and help each other? Instead you all drifted apart. You're just running away from reality. What's with that? You should take responsibility. I feel really bad about Takashi-san and his friends. Stop that! Wai- Shuji-san. You have become used to apologizing like this. Where are you working? Same as before, in Kawasaki's school lunch centre. You've gotten a lot older. It's been ten years after all. You have as well. Have I? Of course I have. Masato is also already an adult. He's very serious now. You met him? Last month, I went to Hadano. Why? Why did you do that? I got a letter. Saying he had someone he wanted to marry and wanted me to meet her. She's a really nice girl. And she knew what Masato had done. He's thinking about such things? They're living together now. She is pregnant. I heard a rumour. You hit your boss and quit your job, right? I was in the wrong. The brother was a murderer, and the younger sister went to an all-girl high school, right? Making it a family of murderers, changing the title and the content of the article, of course you'd be angry. The younger sister had attempted suicide. If she hadn't failed it would have been a better article, he said. I wanted to become a reporter to make the world a better place. In junior high school. Saving someone by doing that. But I realized that I don't have the power to do that. Neither have I. You were always first, in graduating university and finding a job. I was always just gloomy like this. I also don't know where to go. I'm looking into this case at the moment. You remember it, right? An elementary school girl died of head trauma. A boy also died. There were marks of a five pointed star and the murder was taped. They arrested a 14 year old boy. I think he's the same age as you, but he's gone of the radar. The case in Saitama Enough. This was what you came here for right? You 'd enjoy it. But I don't care any more. But you have talent. If you were to return That's what I hate. It makes me feel pathetic. That's why we broke up. Are you planning to work at the factory forever? The sparrows of yakitori restaurants kind of taste like a shovel from a sandbox. Do they? You've had them before? How about frog? They don't sell that at a yakitori restaurant. Sometimes they do. Who's that girl? Suzuki's girlfriend? No way, isn't she kinda cute? Is that what it is? Suzuki, you're doing well! You can still see it a bit, but I washed it. For just a bit, can I walk with you? ðŸŽµArigatou by Inoue Yosui & Tamio Okuda Everyone who has been talking, thank you. We won't listen to what you say. Thanks to Suzuki this was pretty good. Shall I go? Okay. I'll find a cute girlfriend like Suzuki did. Shimizu-san, your kansai dialect is gross. Gross! Your face is gross. ðŸŽµOsaka de Umareta Onna by Hagiwara Kenichi Amazing! Shimizu! Suzuki! You sing something as well. I don't really know any songs. You must have been to karaoke before. It's my first time. How about an anime song? ðŸŽµMakafushigi Adventure by Hiroki Takahashi (ost Dragon Ball) Energetic, more energetic. Energetically! Nice, Suzuki! You don't have to sing any more. Shimizu-san Fujisawa-san was really cute. Right, Suzuki? Thanks again for the thing with my fingers. We're friends after all. Since you said you'd be sad if I died. I would. From: Yamamoto Mizuki I'm sorry for the other day. Tell me your opinion about the 17 years old case again. Thank you very much. [The ruins of the radio tower that became the stage of the Five-pointed star incident] [Mrs. S who acted as Aoyagi's mother at the medical school for children] Sachiko, Masuda-kun came. Masuda-kun.. Thank you. I have something to tell you. I betrayed Manabu. I was afraid I'd get bullied. You were Manabu's friend. That's the truth, right? No. I I don't want to hear it. I'm going to die. So please. No. Sorry. Father. This is Chihiro. I'm Chihiro. I heard she's pregnant. Yes. Only three months. Masato-san is working seriously. His job is very hard and his body is hurt all over when he gets home. but he doesn't complain. And tried to heal as best as possible. The thing I made you guys take care off, I'll soon be able to do it myself. Once you're married and have a child, what do you plan to do? You took away the lives of three children. Can you really be happy once your own child is born? Can you tell your own child that you took the lives of other children? Do people who did something wrong not deserve to be happy? Do they have to become unhappy, like you are? Can't you laugh with us? I can't. Are you telling me to kill my child? Will you be happy then? Our family broke up because of you. And now your starting your own? You need parental permission for surgeries before you're 18. That's what the hospital told me. So, please sign here. Did you talk to your father? And the partner? Who is he? Does he know? I'm asking you because I can't do that. Why are you asking me. Because I don't know you. Yui. Have you ever thought about life? Even though you cared more about other kids than about me. You're acting like a mother now? Here. Is this me? I should go home. I'll go with you. I want to get groceries. Masuda. This. Isn't this Fujisawa-san? It has to be. If she took of her glasses. See, look. It's rape. I found it in the mailbox. It had no sender. This is definitely Fujisawa-san. She was hiding this. Fujisawa-san is getting it. It's Suzuki, what should we do? Suzuki. Suzuki, look at the TV. Do you know who this is? You have to be quiet. You're doing this with Fujisawa-san as well, right? How nice. Let us do it too. How annoying. What did you say? How annoying. Is that how you see me? Is it? Enough already. Let go. You've been thinking of me like this all along? Huh? Masuda, are you okay? Good, Masuda. What? What is he doing? What are you doing? Why are you laughing? What are you laughing at? Shut up! Shut up! Stop it already. Masuda. Let's close it. Masu-yan. Clean this up. Suzuki should practice, from watching TV. Utsuni. Yes. Let's go drink. What did you do? If your my friend, tell me. What have you done? I have to go. I have to go. Where are you going? Be with me. Please. Thank you very much. The second murder scene. After killing a kind little boy, a five pointed star was made of sticks and rocks, and set on fire. Junior High school Kentaro Aoyagi attended. First murder scene. A young girl was killed after school by being beaten with on stone on her head. Sorry, we aren't opened yet. Is Kosugi-san here? oh, yes. Yu-chan. Someone's here. Yes. What is it? I'm looking into the case of 17 years ago. Where did you hear about me? Well, I looked into Aoyagi Kentaro's classmates. Over there. Am I causing trouble? Not really, it's fine. Ask whatever you want to know. He was your classmate in junior high school, right? No, ever since kindergarten. Until he got arrested, we were always together. You're making so much noise. Be quiet. Look at this. Oh, it's Aoyagi. He's laughing. He's actually laughing. He also laughed like this in elementary school. Elementary school? He changed. He started killing bugs and such. And escalated from there. To cats and such. I've also seen him cut his wrist. Such people exist, right? Such weird people. In every class. But really, this all, feels very nostalgic. After high school, I went to Tokyo, despite my parents protests. Before I knew it, time passed. If you ask what I did, I worked in a pub. I was so done. And at that time, He called out to me. At first, we were in a regular relationship. He had money and took me all kinds of places. But, after a while, He'd made me do adult videos. It wasn't because I loved him. And I didn't really understand. But, it become more and more difficult. And somehow, both my heart and my body became weird. I hated it so much I ran away to the countryside. And then he followed me. If I go back home, he'd spread the videos I appeared in there. And I'd just cause trouble. I'm dirty, And don't deserve to live. That's not true. Did you like filming again after such a while, Miyoko? Did we film it over there? I send a DVD to those people you know. Are you listening, Miyoko? Stop already. Please. No, don't go! You can't go! The girl you're dating, attempted suicide. She got crazy after being punished. What are you doing? Sorry. Stop! Stop it! What? Here. You bastard. This won't kill me. That's gross. Hey, Miyoko. I was waiting for you. Kill me already, please. What are you doing? It's easy to kill someone. What? Here. Hit me with this. It's easy, very easy. Don't mess with me. It can't be helped. Suzuki-san stop! Watch me die. He's crazy. You want to be with someone like him? It's no good being with someone that crazy. Disappear. Don't bother me any more. Gross. Enough. Enough already. Aoyagi Kentaro was assaulted since childhood by his mother. Because of that, his sexual development was disturbed. After killing a boy he tried to turn himself in. He might have been holding back destructive impulses since childhood. And isn't he trying his hardest now to live, repressing that? No one can understand those impulses. But people who have experienced similar things, might sympathise with him But I can't get there yet. This is an amazing article. Didn't you say you had given up on being a journalist? I wanted to know what kind of person he was. Welcome. Can I still order a meal? Sure. Then why are you showing me this? Isn't it because you want to turn it into an article, because you want a new chance as a reporter? No. Many people are interested in him. What he thinks about the incident. How he feels about the victims. I'm the one who wants to know that the most. What if your boyfriend was a murderer? Someone you loved to bits, turned out to be a murderer. I avoid such people. If you're friends, if you're together, you might be able to save him. Your friend might have committed another crime. Will you still stand by him? I wasn't trying to catch him. Then prove it, and write an article. I'm sorry, but I can't say that this is the truth about him. You're not truly facing him. I'd like to see the karaoke video you wrote about. Aoyagi Kentaro. Is in it, right? Please. I want to see it. He's really alive. Just like anyone else. Welcome home. I'm back. Did Shimizu-san and such go drinking? Probably. Shall we drink as well? We don't have money. And the weather is great. In the park? We can buy some snacks in the convenience store. let's go. It's a big roll cake! It's empty. Drink! I've had enough. But I'll drink. Masuda-kun. thanks for inviting me. Don't worry about it. I had something I wanted to talk with you about. About what I have done. And you? What is haunting you? I've thought that for a while. You also have something in your past that is haunting you, and you're trying to run away from it. Me? Please tell me about your classmate who committed suicide. What did you do to him? Why does it still haunt you? Nothing. That's not true. Every night you, That's you, right? When I was little, I killed someone. It is probably incomparable to my crime, but tell me. There's nothing to tell. Even if I talk about my crime, no one will understand. But, I did something I can't take back. And I feel like you can understand that. And if you can understand that, than maybe you will tell me about it. So, I want you to tell me about your crime. I want you to tell me about what's haunting you. You're just thinking about yourself. What about the pain of the person you killed? The life they didn't get to live? What about the life you took away? If you really want to die, I'll kill you with this. Or will you kill me in secret? Rip me apart? I don't do that any more. I've already decided that. If so, you'll just have to shoulder it. They died, they're no longer here. But we are alive. That's why. That's why you shouldn't do it. I can only repay this by dying. I do believe that. Living has no value. Even so, I want to live. I shouldn't after doing something so horrible. But in my heart, I really want to live. I'm horrible, aren't I? I'm really horrible. This is just in. It's about the first grade elementary schooler that was killed in Saitama. Did something change? It did. The police have arrested a forty year old man. In the case of the elementary schooler killed in a tunnel under the highway, the police have arrested a 40 year old man. Just now. Sugimoto. Don't change direction. Sure. Yamauchi-san, you're going to work now? Yes. What a coffee to wake up? My treat Really? That? I don't have any children, but if that were my son, I'd want to stop being their parent, right? Yes. Be careful. Thanks. I'm very sorry. If they know anything, we will hear about it. Shiraishi-sensei. It's the hospital. It's an emergency. Yes, this is Shiraishi. We received your number from the father. An emergency. Why are you doing this? I haven't used your article. And the picture? You stole it right? Are you okay with doing that? Masuda-kun! That's your name, right? Telling the world what it wants to know is our job as magazine. That's all it is. Don't mess with me. Are you gonna snap again? Are you going to do that whenever you don't like something? Don't come closer. Stop! Everyone is ignoring how I get bullied. I'm going to kill him now. Watch! Masaki-kun! Imagine it. I don't care any more. You also abandoned me, didn't you? Image what happens when someone dies. They will disappear. You can't meet them, or talk with them. Nor touch them. They're no longer in this world, that's sad, isn't it? Let go. Let go! Let me go! I'm sorry, I have to go. It's very important. Stop! Sensei, you're abandoning me, right? Calm down. Don't go! Excuse me. Brother, Get inside. I won't allow the wedding. Okay? Go home. It's my son. They're wondering who you are. They can't! Brother. I apologise. Please continue the ceremony. Sorry. I apologise. Please. Please, brother. Stop, please stop this. Stop it already. I did what I had to to protect my family. The reporters gathered in front of our house, causing trouble in the neighbourhood. Your heart was also breaking. I'll never forget how happy you looked, when I said, we should split up the family for a while. Brother. That's not true. Brother. If we're a family, we should just start over. Once things clear up, we would just start over. I really believed that. Once day, One day, You can protect family, right? For family, right? It must be possible. From: Hideto Suzuki-san Can I come to your room tonight? Sorry Welcome home. Suzuki bought this. Please. This is more important. Was this you? It wasn't me. But it's a picture from the karaoke. But, to think we were living with a murderer. What do you think? I'm repelled. Where's Suzuki-kun? The second floor. He doesn't leave his room. They died. You were four months along? Were you planning on having it? Time just passed when I was worrying about it. If you don't have a child, you could do the job you love, right? And you don't have to spend that much money. And you don't have to worry they become criminals, or get killed. They only bring sadness. Children give you immense happiness. Are you serious? Even though you're only thinking about those monsters, and not even once about the feelings of your own child? I see. I also, killed my own child. Am I know the same as those monsters? Is that it? I'm sorry. After all this time? Too late. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, You're too late. Suzuki-kun. Can I talk with you? Welcome home. Did you see the TV? 43 inch, amazing right? And it was cheap. Because I am in the wrong. Suzuki-kun. What? The shelves. I should have bought those. It's fine. I'll pay you back once we're paid. It's fine. It's because I'm really glad, I got to meet everyone. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's fine. Thank you. Yes? Dad. I I'll shoulder my own sin from now on. So forget about us. About meeting me at all. Forget it. What about your child? It's still there. Inside Chihiro. We'll raise it. I do feel bad for the children that passed away. I see. Utsuni. I'm heading out. It might rain. Put this away. Yes. Thanks for everything. Goodbye. -Suzuki- Suzuki-kun Where are you now? With what feelings are you continuing to live? I couldn't talk about it back then. About what I did. But I will now. In my second year of junior high school, a classmate committed suicide. He opened his heart only to me. He was a precious friend. Even so, his body and mind were battered by daily bullying. One day, he called me. I was afraid that I would also get bullied. And I abandoned him. We pretended he was dead, and wrote eulogies for him. I couldn't be the only one who didn't write anything. I wrote: See you. But he still called me. "Masuda-kun, I'm at my limit." "Maybe it's better if I died." "What do you think?" Do what you want. Those were my last words to Manabu. Chibi? Chibi? I can't go back to that day. I can't go back to that place I killed Manabu. That's my crime. And I also did you wrong. I had to go to the place, I couldn't go to. I had to go to this place. I had to. Because I have a friend that I can't let die. This time I don't want him to die. I want him to live. Because we're friends.
