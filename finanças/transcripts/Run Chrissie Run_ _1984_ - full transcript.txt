(thunder rumbling) (tense music) (car door clicks) (car door bangs) (remote clicks) (engine humming) (feet padding) (ball bouncing) - Must be his wife, ex-wife. And that'll be their little kid. - So much for your planning. - It's still on, Michael. (remote clicking) It's still officially sanctioned. - Official sanction does not include a woman and child. - Well, they're included in this one, Michael. (body thumps) - No, you don't. (remote clanks) Now, what are you saying to me? (gun clicks) - It's a setup. They've set you a test. - What test? - [Man] A test of your loyalty. - Why? - There's been talk you're not the Michael Riley of old. That you've started to doubt, gone soft. Michael... (moans) - [Michael] Who says, I want names. - It was all of them. - Even your father? - Even him, it was unanimous. Michael, please. - Oh, that's lovely. (gun clicks) That's great. - Michael, you're still the best, our best technician. Now show them you haven't lost it, that's all you have to do. - You tell them I'll see them in hell first. (gun bangs) (pop music) - [Chrissie] It's all yours. - [Eve] Ta, have you left me any hot water? Well? - [Chrissie] What, oh yeah. Hey, Mom, did you iron my tennis gear? - [Eve] What? - [Chrissie] My tennis gear, did you iron it? - [Eve] Oh, that's tomorrow. I was thinking it was next week. - No, we're off to Wimbledon next week. - [Eve] Right, of course. - [Chrissie] Though Cathy reckons we'll get thrashed. - [Eve] Well, you've beaten them before haven't you? - [Chrissie] Well, yes, but that's when Sophie Laslow was still at school. - [Eve] Oh, I see. - [Chrissie] Cathy's always comparing yourself to her. - [Eve] She was the one with the good backhand. - [Chrissie] Sophia Laslow's backhand was harder to get back than virginity. - Chrissie Flagler! - It's one of Cathy's. - I hope so. - Of course I haven't got a clue what it really means. - Are you sure you're not trying to tell me something? - No, not yet. (Eve sighs) But I've thought about it. - Which is more than I was ever allowed to do. - Poor Mommy. - Poor me. (lips smack) - Anyway, if Cathy can just forget about Sophie, think positively and play her natural game, we've got a good chance then. - [Eve] Confidence, ya! - [Chrissie] We'll kill 'em. (tense music) (pot clanking) Good night. - Good night. (lips smacking) (light switch clicks) (water splashing) (Eve groans) - Hello, Eve, shh! Right, now downstairs quietly. (pop music) - You need a gun now, Michael? (gun clicking) What are you doing here? - It's quite simple, Eve. I've come for the money. - I'm sorry, it's all gone. - Really? That's not very prudent of you, you must have been expecting someone like me to turn up sooner or later. - For a while I did, yes. But after all these years. (shouting) - Shh! - Eve, for God's sake, I'm not here for lies. I've done my homework, I know where you work and what you do. And the fact that you have a bank account, number 60215, which contains over half the original amount of the money. So can we press on please? - And do what, Michael? (hand slaps) - You get me that money tomorrow morning in cash, or I start talking, beginning with the little girl upstairs, Christa-Marie I believe. - Well, go ahead, I've been trying to tell her the truth for years. - All very clever, always so damn clever. - You'll have to think of something else. - Oh, don't you worry, I will. There's an awful lot of people in this world who'd like to know who you are, and where you are, the West German Police. - Touche. - Right, so we do have a deal? - Sort of beginning to look like that. - [Michael] Good. - [Chrissie] Mom, are you all right? - Yes, I'm all right, darling. Everything's fine, you go back to bed. This is Mr. Riley. This is my daughter Chrissie. - Hello, Chrissie. - Mr. Riley's had some bad luck, he wants me to stay up and talk it over. (clock chiming) - Mr. Riley's had some bad luck, if only you knew. - I don't want to know. - No, that doesn't surprise me either, Eva Anne Trackle. (liquid trickling) You never were a paragon of loyalty. (bottle bangs) - I'm loyal to Chrissie. I was loyal to her father. - Yes, the great Horst Flagler, is this him? - Yes - Carrying you off on his white charger, what happened? - He was killed. - I heard that much, how? - Car accident. - Here in Sydney? - Yes. - When? - I guess it was just three years. - And you're still Frau Flagler? - [Eve] Yeah. - You kept his image in your heart, untainted, unrivalled, framed in gold. How very quaint. - [Eve] You know, it's quite amazing. - What is? - You haven't changed at all. - And you really loved him. - Oh, yes. - You sure? - What? - You mean, you're sure he wasn't just someone to get you out of it all, that's what I think it was? - Does it matter? - Of course it bloody matters. - [Eve] Why? - Because I don't believe a word you've been telling me ever since I came in here. In those days there was nobody else with me. There was nobody else, but me. (Eve's fist thumping) (Michael groans) (Michael's hand slaps) (Eve moans) (Eve's hand thudding) - Oh, Jesus! (Eve laughs) (Michael puffs) - You're very naughty. (Eve moans) (curtains clicking) (traffic humming) (horn tooting) (train clanking) - I'll tell you what we're gonna do. (Eve sighs) It's not that. (Michael laughs) We're gonna take Chrissie to school. - No. - Yes, just like everything's normal. (lips smacking) Then we go to the bank, pick up the cash, collect Chrissie, and then take off. - No, we don't have to go anywhere. We can stay here. - No, I'm afraid we have to leave. - Why? - Well, I'm in a little bit of trouble. - So what's new? (Michael groans) - No, I mean real trouble. - I thought you'd left... - I have, but not under the best of circumstances. I killed a man, a fellow member. - Oh, my God! - Right, they're not going to let me walk away on that one. The word's out someone's after me, I don't know who it is, but you can bet your life he'll be damn good. - Oh, Michael, you bastard. - That's why we have to leave. - That's all I need, a gang of Irish stormtroopers banging down the door. - I'm sorry, but didn't know all this was gonna happen, did I? - Well, it has. You have to go. Get out, please. - I can't. - Why? - Why do you think, woman? I found you, they'll find you, you get the woman, you get the man. Besides I'm not leaving you here or anywhere ever again. From now on, it's the three of us, we'll just disappear and start again. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. - No, not Chrissie, not Chrissie. - There's no choice, Eve. (radio playing) (traffic humming) (camera clicking) (car door banging) (Pitt coughs) (car wheels crunching) (birds chirping) Now, Chrissie, I don't want you to tell anyone about me, all right? - Why should I? - I'd just rather you didn't, okay? - Okay. (car door clicking) (door banging) - Hi, Flags. Hi, Mrs. Flagler. - Hello, Cathy. - See you later, bye. - [Eve] Good luck. (engine revving) - Who was that guy? - No one. - Thought your mom might have finally found a boyfriend. - That'll be the day. (crowd chattering) (phone ringing) - [Eve] Sorry I'm late, Frank, it couldn't be helped. (door bangs) - Oh, well then, if it could be helped, who am I to worry? - I want to close this account of mine. - I really think in a situation like this a quick telephone call would be... - Now, in cash. - Good God, Eve, what's happened? - Frank, I just want the money. - You're not going to tell me? - Everything's fine, really. - Then I'd better get the ball rolling, huh? (crowd chattering) (tense music) (door clanking) (door bangs) (machine clicks) (feet tapping) - Ah, strewth, Eve, I thought you were big, bad Frank. (case clicking) - You finished, Suzy? - Yeah, a few minutes ago. - Okay, no, it goes in here. - You all right there, mate, are you? - Sure, I'm being remarkably patient. - Feel like putting a bomb under 'em, eh? - Do you reckon the customer would notice if I nicked to couple of these? - Yes, I would actually. - [Suzy] Hey? - It's mine. - Strewth! (phone rings) (tense music) - Ah, there you are. Christine. - Thank you, Mrs. Flay. Hello? - Chrissie, are you alone? - Well, sort of. - [Eve] Good. - What's wrong? - Listen carefully, darling, and do exactly what I tell you, okay. - [Cathy] But, Flags, you've gotta play. - I can't, I have to meet Mom. - That's stupid, why do you have to meet her? - I don't know, I just have to, I'm sorry. - You don't care about us getting thrashed. - Now that's dumb, of course I care. There's nothing I can do, I have to go. - Chrissie! (tense music) - You wanna what? - Buy your car, please, how much would you like? (Suzy laughs) $2,000, I think that's fairly generous for an old mini, don't you? Suzy, I'm in a hurry, could I have the keys please? - Yes, the keys, in my bag, hang on. (feet pounding) (door clicks) - Which one is it? - That one. - Okay, thanks. - Thanks, I would have been locked out. - Could you close this after me, please? - Yeah, and give it full choke, or it won't start. - Right, thanks. (door bangs) - Strewth! (feet pounding) (tense music) (door clicking) (door banging) (case clicking) (traffic humming) (feet pounding) - Hey, watch it! (engine splattering) (engine revving) (wheels screeching) (engine humming) (horn tooting) - [Eve] Chrissie! Come on, quick. Come on, darling. (brakes screech) (door bangs) (engine revs) (wheels crunching) - Whose is this? - It's Suzy's, I bought it. - [Chrissie] You bought it? - Yeah. - Why, where are we going? - Look, darling, just put your seatbelt on, okay. (tense music) (engine roaring) - Is that our car back there? - [Chrissie] Our car? - Yeah, can you see? - Hey, I think it is. Are you gonna tell me what's happening? - We've got to get away. - From him? - [Eve] Yeah. - Why, what does he want? - He wants that. (engine revving) (horn tooting) Yes, it is a lot, I closed off our account. - And he wants to pinch it from you? - [Eve] Yeah. - Well, why aren't we going to the police? - We can't. - [Chrissie] Why not? - Because the money's stolen. It was a gang of us, there were a couple of banks in Germany about 17 years ago. - Before I was born you were a bank robber? - Well, I was looking after the money. Oh God, Chrissie, the others were caught, and I got stuck with it. - Couldn't you have given it back? - And have you born in jail, no, thank you. (tense music) (engine revving) (wheels screeching) (wheels screeching) (engine revving) - [Man] Oh, hey! - [Chrissie] Mom, what you doing? You're gonna hit something. (people yelling) Mom! (engine revving) (wheels screeching) - [Man] Oh, mind that, what do you think you're doing? (crate crashing) (wheels screeching) (engine revving) - We're safe now. - Oi, move your God damned truck, short ass. (engine humming) (belt clicks) (door clicks) (door bangs) (crashing) (apple crunching) (glass smashes) (glass smashes) (engine humming) - [Chrissie] Couldn't you have just given him the money? - [Eve] No, he wanted more than that. He wanted us to go away with him? - [Chrissie] Why, what did he want that for? Mom, I thought we trusted each other. How come you went to bed with him? - [Eve] Now, that's enough, Chrissie, okay. (door crashing) (books clattering) (radio blaring) (camera clicking) (Pitt coughs) (car crashes) (water splashes) (saw grinding) - We'll get another car in the next town. I always hoped this wouldn't happen, but it has. So, we cope with it. - So what happens now? - We keep moving. - But we'll be coming back eventually? - No, we can never go back. - But we can't just leave everything. - Chrissie, we have no choice. Michael is not going to give up easily. If he doesn't find us, someone else might. - The police, you mean? - Well, yes, or the people following Michael. Unfortunately, there are several possibilities. - Oh, terrific! I don't believe this is happening. I can see it now, my mother, the bank robber. (board clicking) (doors clicking) (tense music) - Terrier? - Mr. Pitt, I believe. - I don't know how to tell you this, but you just missed him. He made contact last night, and then this morning they went off together. Then later this afternoon he came back alone. Over here. - And? - What? Oh, and he searches the place, and then goes again. - You lost him, is that what you're telling me? - [Pitt] Well... (case clanks) Of course, if you hadn't told me just to watch, I could have caught the bastard myself. (van door clanking) - I do my own catching, Mr. Pitt. - [Pitt] Okay. (wheels crunching) (doors banging) - Sex. - [Landlady] Straight along there, turn left, any of them will do, they're all open. - Oh, I need... - The bathroom's up at the end, and don't use too much water. (country music) - Could I have some money please? I'm thirsty. - Don't you want to have a shower first? - No, you go, I won't be long. - Okay, we can eat and then shower. Chrissie, what's the matter, hum? - I just want a few minutes by myself. - You have a beer? - Do you have lemon squash? - Where you headed? - Nowhere. - Nowhere! It's a funny place to go. - Is it? Excuse me? - Yeah? - Can you ring Sydney on that? - Yeah, if you've got the money. (phone squeaks) (light clicking) (traffic humming) (police sirens blaring) (bottle smashing) - [Neighbor] Shut up, you mug, a man's trying to get some sleep. (birds tweeting) (feet pounding) (foot thudding) (all laughing) (feet tapping) - Oh, thank you. - Yous all right then? - [Eve] Yes, thank you. - [Chrissie] Can I ask you something? - Yeah. - How did it happen? - Oh, Chrissie. Okay, well, can you imagine, try to imagine what it would be like to be with the same group of people for two years, they love you, they hate you, they exhilarate you, they criticise, they devastate. - You were brainwashed? - Well, indoctrinated maybe. - All right, but how did you end up there in the first place? - Oh, I was rebelling against my whole upbringing. Not so unusual, huh? It was the '60s, Vietnam was the beginning. We were demonstrating against the Shah of Iran. I was more involved in the university, and we..., I believed in the motto, "Kill one, educate hundreds", can you understand, Chrissie? (upbeat music) (engine humming) (men cheering) (Toe cheering) - What are they trying to do? - It's all right, darling, they're just having their fun. (men shouting) (men laughing) - Hello, lady. (lips smacking) (brakes screeching) (gate crashing) - Wow! They disappeared. - Yeah. (duck quacking) (engine humming) (man sniffing) (engine revving) (Toe cheering) (brakes screeching) - Mom! - It's all right. - Now? - Wait. (belt clicking) Now! - [Man] Excellent, I can't wait. (car doors bang) - [Eve] Get away from that car. - Why? (gun clanking) (gun bangs) (glass smashes) You'd better run that way. (gun clicks) - [Man] Ergh, let's go, come on, mate. (body thudding) (gun bangs) (glass smashes) - You hurt my car. - And what were you going to do to us? (gun clicks) (gun bangs) (explosive bang) (door crashing) - [Neighbor] Knock it off you noisy bastard. - What a drag. Piss off. (gun clicks) - Yes, indeed, Major, we do live in exceedingly complex times, but if we could press on, please. - Yes, yes, of course. Darling, what did Christine have to say when she rang you? - She just wanted to know if we'd won the match. - The tennis match? - [Cathy] We lost. - What else did she say? - [Cathy] Nothing really. - Now, Cathy, I want you to understand, there's absolutely nothing to worry about. We just wanna know where they've gone. - But why though? I don't get it, why were you with them yesterday? - Well you see, I was investigating a certain matter concerning Chrissie's mother, but unfortunately Mrs. Flagler decided not to accept our offer of protection. - Protection? - Yes, we have reason to believe that she's a little frightened of someone. It's nothing too serious, and I'll assure you we're doing everything we can. But I know you'll appreciate that in a police investigation of this kind, I'm duty bound to remain fairly tight-lipped. So if Chrissie gave you any clue at all, Cathy, I know that you'll realise that by helping us you'll be helping them a great deal. - I don't know. She sounded really weird. I don't know where she was. I kept asking what was happening, but she just said she couldn't tell me. She said something about Adelaide, and she just said not to tell anyone. - Adelaide! (plane engine buzzing) - [Pilot] You know what this is down here, the whole place? - [Chrissie] No. - The Barossa Valley, full of grapes, and krauts. (plane engine buzzing) - Why are we flying so low? - [Pilot] We're landing. - Why are we landing? - It's getting dark, I haven't got a lynch foot riding. - [Eve] You said you'd take us into Adelaide. - [Pilot] I lied. (melancholy music) (thunder cracking) (Chrissie cries) - Okay, we've gone far enough. We look for somewhere around here, krauts or no krauts. I don't know whether that's good or bad. Oh, hey. You'll bounce back, we'll soon be able to put it all behind us. Chrissie? - [Chrissie] No (crying). (truck engine roaring) (country music) - You can't leave it here, you know. - [Toe] Shut your gob. - What do you wanna leave it there for? - It's a monument. (boot slams) - Don't care what it is, you can't leave it here. - It's a sin. - What? - And sins have gotta be paid for. - Your father never told me to shut my gob. - Shut your gob, Ma. (hands slam) (country music) - Good day, is this thing yours? What actually happened here? - What are you? - I'm a reporter, mate. - Yeah, well you can shut your gob too. - Now, listen, hang on, I just wanna find out what happened here. They tell me there was two women, is that right? - They call me Toe. - Toe? - Yeah. - That's your name? - Toe. - Good day, Bob. - Good day, Bob. (all laughing) - Yeah, okay. Tell us what exactly happened here anyway? - Don't you wanna know why? - Why what? - Why they call me that. - Why they call you Toe? - Yeah. - Listen, what's going on here? - Don't do it mate. - [Toe's Mate] No, it's okay, he's dying to know why. - Now, listen, Toe. - Yeah, what? - Tell me about... (Toe farting) Tell me about these two women. (birds tweeting) - My estate manager and his wife occupied the place until recently actually. - Oh, I see. - Yes, well he retired, and the new man's local. So... Was our first home as a matter of fact, my wife and I. She died. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, some time ago. Well, Mrs. Thompson, I think this is all we need. (bird tweeting) (suspenseful music) (motorbike engine revving) (rider yelling) (bike crashing) (body thudding) - Oh, whoa. - You all right? - Yeah, ooh. Yeah, I'm right. - Hang on. - Thanks. You wanna come for a ride? - No, thanks. Is it all right? - It's just the mudguard, I think. - Do you live here? - Yeah, me and Dad. What are you doing here? - Mom and I are gonna rent the house back there. - Oh, the cottage, are you? It's okay, oh! (Chrissie laughs) - I'm sorry. - That was nothing, you should have seen me last week. - Paul, you all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. - I just couldn't believe him, he said he does it all the time. - Well, at least you'll know someone at school tomorrow. - Tomorrow? (door bangs) - Back to normal as soon as possible, okay. - I haven't seen... (radio blaring) (woman laughs) (water splashing) - Bloody surrogate codpiece, scourge of our society. - Frustration again, I presume. - The wharf, mate of mine saw him there yesterday, he hopped a truck. - And the truck was on route to? - Point of conjecture, Your Honour. My beady-eyed little mate didn't exactly say which truck, simply that it was one of three on route to Melbourne or Brisbane or Adelaide. Anyway, the word's out, though no one's saying anything yet. - I want to read you something. - I must blow that thing up one day. (Pitt whistling) - "Women blow up car." - Eh? - "A car belonging to a local young man "was incinerated yesterday by two women "described as stunning blondes. "The young man claims "that while he was rendering assistance to the women "on a lonely stretch of highway near Goolgowi "the older woman suddenly brandished a sawn-off shotgun "and fired into his petrol tank. "Local police..." - Where's Goolgowi? - "Local police refuse to comment." - Where's Goolgowi? - It's on the way to Adelaide. - Boom, boom. (water splashing) - [Man] Christa-Marie Flagler. - [Michael] She might not be using her own name, of course. - [Man] That's why you want new enrollments, 15-year-old girls? - [Michael] Correct. - You realise that could well involve many schools. It may take days. - I do realise that, Mr. Trough. - Clough. - Clough, my apologies. - Yes, all right, Mr. Devlin. I'll pass this onto my assistant and get back to you in due course. - How'd you like me to pull your face off, Mr. Clough? - Pardon? - I want to play bureaucratic basketball with you. - A bit of bureaucratic basketball... - Mr. Clough, this is not simply a federal police matter. There are several departments involved in the search for this young girl's mother, including that of the Prime Minister, who's not at all happy the whole thing was allowed to develop in the first place. Immigration, you understand? This girl is a vital link, he wants us to find her. So I would suggest, Mr. Clough, that you start pulling your finger out before you end up losing your very ass. (car engine hums) - Hi, how was it? - Okay, good. - Hello, Mrs. Thompson. - Oh, hello, Paul. - Can I play tennis, Paul's got a court? - I thought we were going to do some shopping? - Please? - Okay. (cricket ball banging) - [Girl] Run. (feet pounding) - The wicket keeper. - Thank you. You have a fine team there. - Thanks. (birds tweeting) (rackets banging) - Good shot. (fence clanking) (laughing) Dad, haven't you got somewhere else to go? - I'm enjoying this. Would you like a tour of the place? - Thank you. - Come on then. - I guess I don't really remember him, though sometimes I think I do. Mom's told me a lot about him. Pretty morbid, eh? - I know what will make us feel better. - Oh, yeah. - [Paul] No, a place. - What sort of place? - It's just over the hill, won't take long, not the way we're going. - What do you mean? Oh, no, you're not getting me on that thing. (motorbike revving) - [Paul] Come on. (clanking) (Paul moans) - [Chrissie] Oh, be careful. - [Paul] Why do I always do that? - [Chrissie] Because you're a klutz, go on. - [Paul] This is it. - [Chrissie] This is what? - My spot. - Oh, do you come and just sit here? - Yeah, sometimes. - It's great. - Do you think so? - [Chrissie] Hmm. What's wrong? - I was really trying to beat you. - [Chrissie] So? - Do you really think I'm a klutz? - No, I don't think you're a klutz. - The way you move, you're like a cat. (feet shuffling) (Chrissie laughs) (melancholy music) - You make me forget everything. - [Paul] What? (lips smacking) - You klutz. - [Paul] Who's a klutz? (door clicking) - [Chrissie] Sorry I'm late. - Ah! - [Chrissie] Forgot all about the time. - Well, how was the old winery? I'm so pleased you seem to be finding your feet again, that's the important thing. (lips smacking) Well, here we are, two little country girls. No more bright lights and fast men. - [Chrissie] That's what you think. - What? - [Chrissie] Nothing. (engine roaring) (wheels screeching) (door banging) (boot clicking) - [Toe] We're here now, Roger, say thank you for the ride. - Thank you. - [Toe] Thank you what? - Thank you, Mr. Toe. - [Toe] And why do they call me that? - [Roger] Hang on, no, no. (Roger groans) - This is Roger. (Roger groaning) - Roger. - He's a pilot. He knows where them two blondes went. (enchanted music) (cases clanking) - Terrier, I think you've made a mistake. - You're going to ask about Mr. Toe. - I'm gonna complain about Mr. Toe. I'm gonna gnash my teeth, and plead with you to give me one reason, just one good reason, why of all things you put him on the bloody payroll. - Canon fodder. - There's a good reason. (horn tooting) (upbeat band music) (hands slapping) (crickets chirping) (Eve screaming) (Eve moaning) (Eve crying) - [Chrissie] Come on. - He was following. (lips smacking) - It's all right, it's okay. Shh, it's all right. Come into the kitchen. It's all right. I'll make you some cocoa. - [Toe] Hey, lady. (door bangs) - You have no right to remain silent. Everything you say will be used as evidence against you. - Slowly against the wall. - [Toe] Oh, sex. - You can put that away now, thank you, Mr. Toe. - What? - [Pitt] The safety catch! - What? - You'll shoot your dick off. (Chrissie cries) - Who are you? - It's Mr. Riley I want, Mrs. Flagler. - Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about. - Mr. Toe! - [Eve] All right, keep him away. - [Terrier] Stop. - I don't know where he is. - [Terrier] You lost him? - Yes. - [Terrier] He'll be back. - I don't think so. - For that amount of money, he'd shoot the Pope. - But he doesn't know where we are. - Neither did we. - It was a sin what you done to my car. (Toe groaning) - [Terrier] Mr. Toe, I do not like being interrupted. I'm going to explain the ground rules. You now have three new house guests, to the outside world, however, we do not exist. You will each continue going about your normal everyday lives with one proviso, when one of you is out, the other is in, to be looked after. - And if he does find us? - If he comes here, we'll be ready. If he makes contact with either of you when you're out, you are not to tell him that we're here. You are simply to give him your fullest cooperation. - That could take weeks. - The important thing to realise, of course, is that your lives are now in each other's hands. - Sleep tight. (light clicks) (water gushing) (Toe spits) - [Eve] Terrier, who is he? - That's a good question. - Will he kill Riley? - No, we're just gonna take him in. (Toe sniffs) - Please, ask him to go away. - You're not on yet. - Course, once Foxy gets rid of this Riley bloke, he's not gonna care what I do, is he? (tongue slavering) (Chrissie screams) (Toe yells) - [Pitt] Now, look, cut it out both of you. - If he touches her again, I'll kill him. (water gushing) (light clicks) (birds chirping) (tense music) - Chrissie, what's the matter? - Nothing. - [Paul] There must be something. - I feel a bit sick, that's all. - Do you wanna go to the sick room and get something? - No. - Oh. - Where'd I put those bloody tablets? Ah, come to Papa. (Pitt sighs) (bottle banging) Where have my tablets gone? - Blast off. - Bloody hell, what have you done to me? - Do try and calm yourself. - Calm myself, do you know what that animal did? He ate my pills. He stole my prescription Coleman tablets. - [Terrier] Bear with him, Mr. Pitt. - [Pitt] Bear with him? - [Terrier] His time will come. - [Pitt] It'll come quickly, I give you fair warning, Terrier, if she doesn't kill him first, I will. - We have a visitor. - [Eve] Caught you. - Oh, sorry, you just on your way out? - No, but you are, go on. - Just wanted to say hello. - Hello. - Hello. Chardonnay, five years old, just right for drinking now. - I'm sorry, but I don't touch the stuff. - Goodbye. - David! - Yeah? - Actually I have got a few things to do at the moment. I'll be in touch in a few days, okay? Bye. (door bangs) - Impressive. (match sparks) (engine humming) - You call him an animal, why did you empty your own damn ashtray? - Not there, is it, Mrs. Flagler? (Pitt coughs) (metal clanks) (feet pounding) - Hi, how are you feeling now? - Paul, I just want you to leave me alone, all right? - Chrissie! What's happened to you? - Nothing's happened to me, I just don't want to see you anymore. Can't you get that through your thick head? (Chrissie cries) (ground crunching) (feet pounding) (door bangs) - Ah, darling. What is it? What's happened? - I had to tell Paul to get lost. Then I spooked myself, thought there was someone following me. I hadn't even thought. - Well, was it Mr. Green? Did he upset you? - No, we didn't have him today. - Now, don't you worry about it, huh? We'll talk later in German, yeah, okay? I'll get you a drink. Look, if you expect me to prepare dinner, I have to go and do some shopping. - Okay. (Terrier speaks German) - [Pitt] Could you give me some cigarettes? Anything extra mild, five packets, five, please? - Hey, will you be okay if I go now? - Yeah. (birds tweeting) (door banging) - Well, hello, Eve, how very nice to see you. - Thank God, Terrier, do you know him? - Now just back off a minute, will you? - He's waiting for you, he's in the house. - What did you say, did you say Terrier? - Yes. - English guy, immaculate? - Yeah, there's three of them. One of them, he wants Chrissie. Michael, you have to help us. - I don't have to help you with a bloody thing, Eve. You just run out on me yet again. Why did you do that? - [Eve] I couldn't put Chrissie in danger. - I said I'd look after the both of you. You just give me nothing, Eve, absolutely nothing. - I love you, Michael. - Maybe, maybe you did once, but I'm not even sure about that anymore. - Don't you remember? My dashing Irishman. You'd just arrived. They'd started to put me through another truthful deal. Why wouldn't I sleep with everyone, it wasn't natural, to stop them. You didn't rant and rave, you just stepped in and took me quietly aside. - That's a little bit of Irish blarney nonsense. You weren't one of them, Eve, you were a child, and you turned your back on me and run away from it all with this Horst Flagler, turned your mind inside out. I didn't even know the bastard. - No one knew him. He didn't exist. It was bits of paper, certificates of birth, death, marriage, a photograph of someone. I made him up. I wanted her to have something normal. I didn't want her to know about me, about you. I'll give you something, Michael, Chrissie is your daughter. (tense music) - You could have got word to me somehow. - How, I couldn't get word to anyone. The police were likely to come busting in any moment. So I did the only thing I could do, I went home to mother. - Jesus. - It was there, I finally realised I was out of it. Oh, I wanted that baby. But I didn't her brought up to our way of life, all that hate. Right or wrong, I'm not sorry, Michael. - How much have you told Chrissie? - I could never tell her about you. - But now you expect me to help you? - [Eve] And then say goodbye, that's what I expect. - You don't ask for much, do you? - Only from people I love. - But when I went to school, it was all feet and inches. (gun clicks) (door bangs) Come on, come on. - [Eve] Hi, how's it going? (lips smacking) - Okay. - Where are my smokes? - Oh-oh! - Oh, no! - I'm sorry, it went right out of my head. - You'll have to go back. How am I supposed to get through the night? - [Terrier] Can't you do without them, Mr. Pitt? - Now that has to be the most witless thing you've ever said, Terrier. Without a certain minimum level of drug input, my brain rapidly turns to marshmallow, and my stomach quietly implodes. You've already got one cucumber, do you really need another? - Point taken. - [Pitt] Thank you. For one awful moment there, I was terrified you're infallible. - Darling, would you mind going please, so I can get the dinner ready? - Yeah. What sort were they again? - Anything extra mild, five packets. You're joking? - Oh, here! - [Chrissie] I won't be long. - Hey, hey. - I just wanna touch her. (door bangs) (feet pounding) (ground crunching) (Chrissie gasps) - It's all right, Chrissie, don't freak, just want to kidnap you, okay. (crickets chirping) - Why doesn't he call? - He's stringing you out. - Surely he must have made some sort of contact by now. (snoring) - That's what I'd do. He doesn't wanna blow it a second time. - I want my daughter back. My god, what if he hasn't got her at all? What if she's had some sort of an accident or something? - Try and remain rational. - I'm going out to look for her. - No! (door clanks) (gun bangs) - You're all right. (hammer clanking) (wood thudding) (melancholy music) (door clicking) (nail file grating) (banging) (china crashing) (banging) (china crashing) - Quiet! Thank you. - Sunday it was in Belfast, we should have been at Mass, but my brother, Billy, he wants to go fishing. He was eight at the time, a couple of years younger than me. Mind you, it was pouring with rain, but Billy says that doesn't matter at all, the fish will be all snobby, they won't be expecting us. So we set off, we had a great time falling in and out of the river. Caught ourselves a fish too, a great big fella, pleased as punch we were. Anyway, we take it home, we hide the fish under the bed, and we're just sneaking out again when, bang, there he stands, the big man, my father, "How was Mass, boys?" We couldn't sit down for two days. And of course, we forgot about the damn fish hidden under the bed. Parents discovered it later on, "What the hell is that?", says my father sniffing around the place. I was pretending to be asleep, but I could see his face when he found it. "Jesus, Maggie', he says, "Would you look at the size of that fish. "We should send them to Mass more often." And then he just stood there looking down at us, and he was proud, so proud. They were the good times. - [Chrissie] Were there any bad times? - Yeah, the bad times came later. I left Belfast, went to Germany, that's where I met your mother. - Why did you go there? - I wanted to fight back, I was so full of hate and rage. - [Chrissie] Why? - They shot my father to death in front of young Billy. I've been hunting them ever since. See that ring, it's my father's, it's the phoenix forever rising from its own ashes. May God forgive us all. Time to make that phone call. - Why are you helping us? Are you and Mom back on together? - At times it's very hard to tell, but you're both gonna get out of this, believe that. - I thought we were getting on really well. - Maybe we both pushed them a bit hard, eh? - Yeah? - They were new to the valley, maybe we were a bit too friendly. - Keep going. (gun clicks) - Well, we don't know anything about them, do we? Why did they come here? - Why did they come here? - Why don't we just give it a rest for a while, eh? After all, it's not the end of the world. (toilet flushing) (Toe belching) (fridge door clicking) - Hey, did you ever see that movie where they blow these Roos apart? (door bangs) Guts hanging out everywhere (laughs). Christ, we laughed. (phone rings) - Hello? - [Michael] Eve? - Yeah. - It's me, I've got Chrissie. - Oh, thank God. Is she all right? Can I speak to her please? - No, no, I'm not giving you anything this time. I want that money, Eve, are you listening? - Yeah, I'm listening. - Right, you try anything this time, anything at all, and you can kiss her goodbye. I hope that's not being too subtle for you. - [Eve] Please, don't hurt her. - No, I won't touch her so long as you do things my way. Now, do you know the old winery down Jenkins Road? - Yeah, I've seen it. - Right, take your car as far up the driveway as you can, then get out and wait, leave the keys in the ignition. - No, no, I'm not getting out of the car until I can see Chrissie. - Eve, you're not making the rules here. - I'm not getting of the car until I can see she's there and she's safe, yeah? - Jesus, all right, you wanna stay in the car, stay in the bloody car. - Where will she be? Where's she coming from? - You leave the keys in the ignition. You put the money on the dashboard where I can see it. You've got 15 minutes, goodbye. (phone clanks) - Bingo. (phone bleeping) (phone clanks) (wires clattering) (door bangs) (door clanks) - Right, Chrissie, downstairs. (feet plodding) Now, you quite sure you know what's happening? - [Chrissie] I think so, yeah. - I want you to go behind there and stay put. Hold on, I've got something for you. - My diary. - Yeah. You are a very fine young lady. Go on. Well, here we go then. (engine humming) - [Terrier] Mr. Toe. - [Toe] What? - [Terrier] You see that line of trees. - What about 'em? - I want you to follow them down as far as you can towards the main building. - You can't do that. If Riley sees him, he'll know. - Without letting him see you. Please be quiet, Mrs. Flagler. - Yeah, okay, and then what? - You wait for our arrival and cover us during the exchange. You don't do anything unless he starts it. Okay, go. - You sure you know how to use that thing? - I shoot Roos, don't I? (door bangs) (tense music) (feet pounding) (engine humming) - What the hell is that? (Toe groans) (remote clicking) - Carry on, Mrs. Flagler. - I hope that bald-headed bastard knows what he's doing. (feet thumping) What's he waiting for? (explosive bang) (crashing) (Toe yells) (door clanks) - Mommy, here! (door bangs) - [Michael] Run, Eve, go! (gun bangs) (machine gun bangs) - Misjudged them, didn't you. (gun bangs) (machine gun bangs) - Out! - [Pitt] The money. - Work, you bastard. (remote clicks) (explosive blast) - [Michael] You okay? - [Eve] Yeah. - I think one of them got out. - [Eve] Terrier? - I don't know, here, hold that. - Okay, out this way? - No, the fruit cake's out there. - What about up there? - I've gotta pinpoint Terrier first. (feet pounding) (machine gun blasts) - Try and drown me, would ya? (machine gun blasts) (Chrissie screams) - Ah, fine. - Get upstairs, find some cover, watch the rear door. - [Eve] No, get down. (feet pounding) - [Toe] Quit running, where are you? Gutless. (gun bangs) - Eve! - [Eve] We're okay. Terrier, I missed him. - Hold on, little Chrissie, hold on. (machine gun blasting) - Hey, Foxy! - Quietly, quietly. (feet pounding) - Who was that? - Mr. Riley. - He's dead? - He's dead. - I'll keep cover in the front. - No, go through the cellar, I'll attack the front. As soon as you hear me take out Mrs. Flagler, you move. - Mopping up, I'm good at that. - Mr. Toe! Be quick, the girl may try and kill herself. - She wouldn't do that to me. (door bangs) (gun clicks) - Michael? - Wait! (machine gun bangs) (machine gun blasts) (Michael groans) - [Eve] Michael? (feet pounding) - [Chrissie] Mom! - [Eve] Up there. Micheal, are you all right? Michael! (tense music) (Chrissie screams) - Please be gentle with me. - Chrissie! (elbow thuds) (Toe groans) (body thuds) - [Eve] No, no! (gun bangs) (machine gun blasts) (body thuds) - [Michael] Okay, back way, Terrier's still out the front, move. (feet tapping) (feet crunching) (feet pounding) - Stop! Checkmate I believe. Put both guns down. (guns thud) I now deliver you, Mr. Riley, to Belfast alive or dead. Either way your friends are anxious to put you on display. To the car. The girl comes as far as Sydney. - [Eve] No! - For insurance, you're staying here. - [Chrissie] No! - There's one thing I've neglected to mention. - Time is of the essence, Mr. Riley. - The ignition is rigged, (mouth clicks), boom. - I believe you're bluffing. - Then allow me to demonstrate. (door clicks) - Wait, you're worth more to me alive. Move. - [Terrier] Get rid of it. - All right, I'm reaching for the wire cutters. - [Terrier] Very carefully. - Then I've got to get in under here. - Over here. (cutters click) A finger squeezed from death, Mr. Riley. - Oh, no! (motorbike revving) - That's two, how many more are there? - Just one more. - Do it now, the whole world's arriving. Let me see it, very slowly. - Something's tangled. - You have one second. - Paul, stop! (machine gun blasting) (gun bangs) - A finger squeeze, Mr. Terrier. (gun clicks) - [Eve] See if he's all right, go on. - You won't, Riley, you can't do it anymore. - Wrong, (Terrier groans) I would if I had to. - Wow. - Here, this will satisfy them, take it, and tell them I'm dead. And maybe they'll let me rest in peace. - How very appropriate. - Let's go! - [Eve] Chrissie. - I've gotta go. - Go, where? - [Eve] Chrissie, come on! - Nowhere. Bye, Paul. (lips smacking) (engine revs) (upbeat music) (siren blaring) (brakes screeching) - [Chrissie] Hey, we made it. (doors bang) So what happens now? - Darling, I think there's a few things we've got to tell you. - So tell her then? - Oh, no, you tell her. - I'm not gonna tell her. - Tell me what? ♪ Hurry sundown ♪ ♪ Sky put your blackout on ♪ ♪ Forest hide me ♪ ♪ From the searchers' guns ♪ ♪ It seems I'm on the run again ♪ ♪ Wilderness my only friend ♪ ♪ That's why I am ♪ ♪ The enemy of man ♪ ♪ Hill protect me ♪ ♪ Warm in your welcoming arms ♪ ♪ Just a mountain ♪ ♪ From the searchers' guns ♪ ♪ I've fallen out with the human race ♪ ♪ Nowhere I show my face ♪ ♪ That's why I am ♪ ♪ The enemy of man ♪ ♪ I can't take the chance of stopping to rest ♪ ♪ Beyond the desert sand my chances are best ♪ ♪ I didn't want to be a rescue deal ♪ ♪ Keep me company ♪ ♪ Talk to me of whispering winds ♪ ♪ You don't judge me ♪ ♪ Tell me how I sense ♪ ♪ Black tar on the city street ♪ ♪ You won't ever feel my feet ♪ ♪ As long as I am ♪ ♪ The enemy of man ♪ ♪ Hurry sundown ♪ ♪ Forest hide me ♪ ♪ Just a mountain ♪ ♪ You'll protect me ♪
