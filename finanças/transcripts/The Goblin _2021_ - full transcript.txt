(The Goblin) (A Charge of Murder of Daejungdong Union Member...) have arrested redevelopment officials, Mr. Kim and Mr. Choi, for murder. But the police investigation is hindered as the whereabouts of the gang that committed the murders under Mr. Kim's orders, are unknown. According to the forensics team, two tracks escaped from the scene. One of them has a narrow range of activities, so we believe he was either passive or injured in the course of the crime. Are you saying only one guy turned the Yeonhap gang's office into a bloodbath? Yes, that is right. This is not some action movie scenario. There is only one man who could have done this. The Goblin. Nicknamed the Baekjeong gang, they constantly move around committing violence under contract. So who the heck is this Goblin? I have only heard rumors about him. A few years ago, one man took out nine of the Hoegwan gang members. That man was the Goblin. So what? Right. The most likely suspect as of now is the Goblin. But his movements are so discreet, we have yet to get any information. So what? Right. Our insider in the Baekjeong gang is trying to dig out who it is, but he is having difficulties. Hey, you. Wake up. Your phone would not stop ringing. Hang in there a bit more. Eun-joo! Sir! This is an emergency. Please go register first. Shut up, you retard! Suck it up! Die, you retard! You seem to be really busy these days. I am sorry. Don't be. - He is the one who should say it. - Boss! It is not me, Boss! I am not... Please don't kill me! - Please! - Shut up! It is not me. Please don't kill me. Hey. (Call History) Do you know what this is? Your call records, you scumbag. Damn it. Where is it? This is Chief Choi Hyung-il from the violent crimes section. Hello? Hello? Young-min. You kill him. Get up, you retard. Boss! Please don't kill me! Stay still! Stay still, you scumbag. What the... Can't you do it? You freaking moron. Kill him. Hurry up and kill him. Kill him, you jackass! Thank you. (Sangmi) (Sangmi Furniture) Sangmi Furniture? Are you asking for a job? I will do anything you say. You can leave anything to me. Please, Sir. Really? If you work in this field for a long time you will see some dorks who forget their place and start acting. Can't you do it? Because he is the Goblin's boss? Go and take a shower first. After I hug Ye-na. No away. You smell like the stink of blood. Hey, Han Ji-young! How long are you going to live with blood on your hands? Are not you ashamed as a dad? You don't deserve to be her father. Why are you here? Did Baek-san send you? I am sorry, Boss. (Sangmi Furniture) Young-min! Good job. Now get going. This is not what you promised. You prick! Have you gone crazy? What are you glaring at, jackass? Son of a biscuit. Douche bag. Let go. Get your hands off. You bugger! You son of a gun! Young-min. Young-min that son of a gun. Don't move! Put your hands on your head! Put hands on your head, jackass! Put your hands on your head! I said put hands on your head! (I don't want to raise Ye-na as a murderer's daughter.) I don't want to raise Ye-na as a murderer's daughter. I am going to tell her you are dead. Don't look for us if you care about Ye-na. Prisoner 4502 is refusing visitors. What the heck? (YM Holdings Jeong Young-min Organization Chart) Hey, did you tattle on us to the homeroom teacher? No, I didn't. I swear. Stop lying! I saw you go into the teacher's office. The teacher was looking for me. Stop lying! I dare you to snitch on us again. - If you do... - Stop it. Don't you guys think three-to-one is too harsh? Shame on you! Mind your own business, new student! New student? You little! Do you want a piece of me? Let go! Who the heck do you think I am? I don't care who you are. Hey, are you going to just stand there? Guys! What are you doing? Crap, the teacher is here. Let's go. Hey. Today is your lucky day. Whatever. Da-hye and Ye-na. Thanks. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Welcome home, Sir. Why are you here at this hour? You know. To have dinner with you since it has been a while. Yeah, right. Since when did you care? - Eun-joo. - What? What is it? What do you think about us living overseas? Overseas? Go live by yourself. It is filled here, but blank here. And what is that car? That car is... (Steam Car Wash Service) Doo-hyun! Spray some here! Do it gently! It is getting on me! Thank you. It is all ready. Chief, you have a visitor. Who? It is me, Kang Doo-hyun. Time flies, does not it? Here. Right. What brings you here? I have a favor to ask. A favor? What is it? Well... Can you look for my family? Family? Hey. This is not a private detective agency. Please help me out. Fine. Only if you help me. Hold on. Have a look. When I arrested you, I thought you were the Goblin. But while you were behind bars, this Goblin did all sorts of things. Gangsters these days are scouting those with MBA to merge companies and darn things. They look like normal companies on the outside and our investigation is going nowhere. So... get me some information... I am sorry. I have cut ties with them. Drink, drink, drink, drink! Here it goes! Tornado! When I was the boss in my pen, a wild beast came in. When the kids were trying to beat him up at night, bam! That fool instantly knocked out six of them! I almost pissed my pants too. But you know me! One damn blow and... Gosh, you are drunk. But guess who he was! The Goblin! Do you know who the Goblin is? Are you laughing at me? You think I am funny, don't you? You douchebag! What are you staring at? You bugger! Let me go, you son of a biscuit! Let go! Let go! You jerk! Stupid retard! Let go, you damn retard! This is Choi Hyung... - Chief! - Doo-shik! The guy you mentioned, Kang Doo-hyun. He is at our precinct. Really? - For what? - Assault. I am on my way now, so hold on to him! What the heck? Hey. Let's go grab some food. Boss. I am sorry, Doo-hyun. I lose it when I am drunk. - It must have hurt. - I am fine. You know how much I care about you, right? I am sorry! I am sorry! I really am! - Let's go. - Sure. Let's go. - What do you want to eat? - Is he the one who got beat up? It will be on me. (Motel) Back when I was a rookie, my seniors told me people never change. So don't feel bad for those who have sinned. I was too young to get the point, so I stood up to them. But these days, I say those words to my rookies. Ask yourself... if people can change or not. (Jubilee Hair Salon) Who are you? Why are you staring at our salon? (Steam Car Wash Service) (Jubilee Hair Salon) Hey, what's up with you? Are not you going to apologize? What did you just say? How dare you glare at an adult! You little! Stop! Don't do it. He is... just someone I know. Excuse me! Hold on, please! Thank you, sir! Sir, do you like my mom? You two look great together. Do you want to take a selfie with me? What? A selfie? Come on, smile a bit more! Here, give me your phone. My phone? This is my number. My mom is a hard woman to seduce. I am sure you will need my help! Hello? When Ye-na was six, we moved to the States. We were going to start over, but both the States and her stepfather were not for her. It has not been long since we came back here after my divorce. To be honest, I have never seen Ye-na laugh so much as she did yesterday. But... don't - get close to her anymore. - Ji-young. Have you ever thought about the shock she would have if she found out about everything? If you truly care about her, don't get any closer to her. Sir? Are you all right? Sir! Are you all right? Sir! I am fine. I am all right. You can't jump out like that! I am sorry. Don't you know this is a school zone? What are you talking about? He is the one who jumped out of nowhere! What the heck? Sir! You are bleeding! It hurts, does not it? It does not. But what were you doing there? Well... Are you okay? I am fine. This is my business card. Could you give me yours just in case? Sure. You prick! Where the heck were you looking? I am sorry. I am sorry, Sir. - Where is Eun-joo? - In the car. - And the one who got hurt? - He left after getting treated. - Did you get his business card? - Yes. I will take Eun-joo with me, you can go home now. Yes, Sir. (Kang Doo-hyun) My mom... She acts tough on the outside, but she is really weak on the inside. Sometimes, she cries under the covers. She has been hurt a lot. It would be nice if she had someone like you, who she can depend on. Here. What is it? Earlier, I stopped by to give you this. Really? It is really pretty. - Do you like it? - Yes! Thank you so much. Ye-na. Can I... hug you? What is that? I have never seen it before. I got it as a gift. Who gave this to you? Don't tell me... Take it off right now. Take it off! I don't want to! It is mine! What is it got to do with you? Do as I say! I don't want to! I don't! I don't know what it is either. But when I am with him, I don't feel scared like I always am when I am with you. You never once think about how I feel. Yeah. Keep an eye on him. It has already been 10 years. What do you mean? 10 years is enough to change nature. Do you think people can change too? Sir, he is none other than the Goblin. He must have a reason for approaching Eun-joo. We must strike first. Sir! Was it when Ye-na was five? We went to the amusement park on Children's Day. The other kids were with their mom and dad. I must have been unconsciously staring at them. Ye-na suddenly grabbed my hand, pretending that nothing was wrong, and said that she wanted to go home since she had enough fun. She was only a baby. Promise me this. No matter what happens, don't let Ye-na down. I won't. I promise. - Is this the place? - Yes, Boss. How may I help you? Why did you hit him? Hey! What do you want? Scumbag, I am Kim Dong-pil. Stay still, jackass. Kang Doo-hyun! Kang Doo-hyun! Where is this, moron? Where are you, Doo-hyun? Kang Doo-hyun! Where did he go? Stay still, you stupid dork. Pick a card. Nice poker face. Okay, okay. I will pick it up for you. Let's see. This one? This one? I prefer this one. Hey! 10 of hearts! 10 of hearts! 10 of hearts is not bad. Nice. 10 of hearts is not bad at all. Stay still, jackass. Does it hurt? I forgot to explain the rules. If you pick the red card, that is how many blows you will take. But if you choose the black one, you are unbelievably lucky. So you have nine left, right? What is with the clenched fist? You scumbag! Huh? You stupid jerk! You bonehead. Hey. I was stoked to get a call from headquarters. It has been a year. Exactly a year. But, hey, I was told to mark a goner like you. Do you think that made me happy? Dude, listen carefully. Do not try to get something good by flattering our CEO, Young-min. Did you see that? This stupid retard. That freaking glare. What the... Move. Don't you dare glare at me, jerk! You scumbag! Holy moly! Jackass! What a freak! Acting all tough, huh? You freaking idiot. I am sorry. It is my fault. I am sorry, Sir. Didn't I... Didn't I? I told you to simply mark him at a close distance. Darn it! - Didn't I? - I am sorry. I am sorry, Sir. Are you all right? What is wrong with the CEO? Forget it. I am going to kill that scumbag. Leave him be. It won't look good if a dead body turns up right now. Don't worry. I will bury him in the deep woods. Your body, not Kang Doo-hyun's, you idiot. What a load of dorks, that moron. (Injection/Rapid Treatment Area) He is currently at a nearby hospital. All he needs are some stitches. If we were going to lay hands on him, we should have just ended him. Should I send in some guys? Leave it. Just make sure to tail him. Yes, Sir. Yes, Boss. Yes. He has not made any particular moves. Yes. Keep watching him. Sir. The Goblin... No. Kang Doo-hyun. What will you do about him? Hey. Watch out. Hey! Good to see you here! What are you guys doing? You little! Are you okay? You are dead meat if you do this again. Let's go. (Daddy's baby girl) Eun-joo? Dad. What should I do? Let's go. Hey! Han Ye-na! Ji-young? What? (Emergency Medical Center) Ji-young! Doo-hyun. Ye-na... What if her operation goes wrong? Don't worry. Ye-na will be fine. I... I can't live without Ye-na. Dad! It is okay, Eun-joo. Daddy is here, so everything will be all right. I don't think so. She is in big trouble. It is a much more serious problem than you think, Mr. Kim. Eun-joo, can you let us talk for a minute? The operation went well. She is out of the woods now. Thank you. Ye-na. Is she going to be okay? As you may know, the brain is an intricate part of the body. We have to wait until she wakes up. She will be fine. I am sure... you get the message, right? Ma'am? Any parent would do the same. The kids were just fooling around. Just settle an agreement when the lawyer comes. Your daughter is helping you out. I am just saying. - There he comes! - Thank you for your hard work. Hello. I am a lawyer, Kang Tae-ki. As for the conditions of the settlement... Hello. Thank you. Are you Ye-na's friend? Yes. Is Ye-na okay? Have to wait a little bit more. The teacher and even the kids are not talking about the accident. It is as if it never happened. But Eun-joo definitely pushed her. Can you tell me more about it? Sure. Please let me meet Eun-joo who was on the rooftop that day. Due to school policy, I cannot disclose information to anyone but law enforcement officials. I am sorry. I have a class now. Ma'am! Are you Eun-joo? Yes. Who are you? - We will get going! - Bye, Eun-joo! Bye, see you tomorrow! I am... Ye-na's dad. What happened on the rooftop that day? Did you... do that to Ye-na? Dude, listen carefully. Do not try to get something good by flattering our CEO, Young-min. Hello? What? What about Eun-joo? Put her on the phone! My baby girl, Eun-joo. You must have been scared. Stop crying. What if your heart hurts again? Don't worry. I will make sure... that does not happen again. Okay, Eun-joo? Listen carefully. We are hunting down the Goblin today. Welcome. Damn. Please don't kill me. Who are you? Ji-young! You freaking messed with the wrong person, jackass. Both of them are here. Hey! Get up. It is your husband. - Answer the phone. - Don't touch them. - Hey! - Don't touch them. Your daughter is sound asleep. Don't touch her. Don't touch her! What should I do? Say goodbye. Bye! Get rid of him. - Yes, Sir. - Speak. Things went south at the motel. Take the kid to the furniture factory. Ji-young! Ji-young! Ji-young! Wake up! Ji-young! Ye-na! Ye-na! Where is Ye-na? They took my baby girl! Ye-na! What should we do? It is Kang Doo-hyun. Young-min... kidnapped my daughter from the hospital. Chief. You said people don't change. - What the heck? - Who is that jerk? Hello, Eun-joo! Have you arrived at your aunt's place? It is me, Young-min. I hope you have not done anything to Ye-na yet. If you dare lay a finger on Eun-joo, I won't sit still. From this point on... I will show you who the Goblin is. You stupid jerk! Fudge. You stupid jerk. Where is Young-min? The furniture factory. Come on. Stop shaking and tell us something. Detective Hwang. - Yes. - Did you find anything? Nothing yet. (Detective Choi) (Sangmi Furniture) Why did you do it? You know better than I do. Eun-joo... Where is she? Where is Ye-na? Kang Doo-hyun. It has been a while. How about your injuries from back then? Freaking douche. Today is your funeral, you moron. What the funk? Kill him, you jackass! What is wrong with him? Who is she? Your daughter? Boss. When I call you, please bring her to the location I mentioned earlier. All right, Doo-hyun. Thank you. Stop... Stop it, you son of a gun! Stop it! Darn it! What the fudge! Is it you? The Goblin? I was actually excited, you jackass. Hey. Here. Pick a card. Pick one. Where is Eun-joo? Ye-na first. Where is Ye-na? You can never kill me. Where is Eun-joo? Eun-joo is on her way here. So tell me where Ye-na is! Tell me where Eun-joo is! Young-min. Ye-na is a patient. She might die if she does not get to the hospital. Please! Ye-na... Ye-na... Where is Ye-na? Bro. Do you know... what I thought of... whenever I got scared or grew weak? I thought about what you would do. If it was the Goblin, he would kill without hesitation. That is how I pushed myself and came all the way here thinking of Eun-joo. Bro, please tell me. Where is Eun-joo? I am nothing without her. Please. Please. Please! Dad? Eun-joo! Dad! Doo-hyun! Doo-hyun! What happened? Are you okay? Ye-na! Where is Ye-na? Doo-hyun. Ye-na! Detective Ma, go to the left. Detective Jo! - Yes. - Go to the right. - Yes, Sir. - Come on! Move faster! - Yes, Sir. - Call over three ambulances! Three ambulances! (Jo Dong-hyeok) (Lee wan) (Director Kim Hui-seong)
