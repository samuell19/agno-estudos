(upbeat rock music) (stereo clatters) - [Man] Aw, hell. Hey, look at that. - [Woman] Far out. Looks like some kinda secret compartment. - See if you can find something to pry this loose. (gentle music) - What do you think it might be? - In this house? My family's lived here for over 200 years. There's no telling. - I know. My mother has a fit every time I come over here. (objects clattering) I found this screwdriver and a pipe. Do you think it'll work? - Let me see. (pipe scraping) I got it. There's a small box inside. - Who's Carlos DeLorca? - He was my great uncle. He raised my father and helped him raise me till his death about 10 years ago. He was really a great guy, as much as I remember. For some reason, my great-grandfather threw him out of the house. He came back when his brother died to help raise his nephew, Juan DeLorca, who was my father. - Wasn't there anybody else to take care of your father? I mean, what happened to the rest of your family? - I really don't know. Uncle Carlos said he'd tell me about it when I got older, but he died. There, I got it. - Hey, looks like a journal of some sort. Here, he was your uncle. Maybe you should read it first. - Maybe we shouldn't read it at all. - Aw, come on. What can it hurt? - [Man] I don't know. - You never will unless you read it. - I guess you're right. I fear my worst suspicions have proved all too true. - For as incomprehensible as it seems, the legend of the DeLorca curse has some basis in fact. Family records show that while trying to contact spirits from the other side, the ceremony was interrupted and some evil force was released that consumed Grandfather's very soul. He thought he'd became a vampire and killed his own wife. The records state that each succeeding male descendant would suffer the same fate. I must do everything in my power to prevent this happening to my nephew Juan. I have the address of a Madam Von Kirst who has special powers that may help me break this curse. (door knocking) (rain pattering) Hi, I'm- - Mr. Carlos DeLorca. I've been expecting you. Here, let me help you with those wet things. - How did you know I was coming? - Well, it is my profession to know. After your last letter, I thought it best to keep track of you're delving into the occult. These matters are rather dangerous for the uninitiated. - Then you know why I'm here. (thunder rumbles) - Yes. And I have already begun the work that you must finish. - Please explain yourself. - Oh, patience, Mr. DeLorca. You have much to learn about the curse that has affected your family before we can discuss the rather delicate question of removing it. - My apologies. But Juan has already begun the transformation and I am anxious to put an end to it once and for all. I'm determined to let nothing stop me. - Good. And believe me when I say you will need to every bit of that determination and courage to complete your task. Let us begin. (thunder rumbles) Look deeply and you will witness, with your own eyes, the fulfillment of the curse upon your grandfather. (thunder rumbles) (Madam Von Kirst speaking in foreign language) (ominous music) (door creaks) (eerie music) (ominous music) (woman gasps) (woman yelps) (woman screams) (handle rattling) (woman whimpering) (woman whimpering) - No. No. (woman screams) (eerie music) (thunder rumbles) - My god! My god! Why?! Why?! I must know. - The answer to that question will reveal to you things and forces beyond the scope of human experience, and will open to you the jaws of hell itself. Have courage or be lost forever. - Tell me what I must do. (thunder rumbles) - Madam Von Kirst. Sadistic. - [Madam Von Kirst] I do not, as a habit, take skeptics or thrill-seekers as clients, miss. - [Yvonne] I'm sure. - Nonetheless, I will make an exception in your case, as I- - Don't bother with the spiel. I'm just here for the thrills, as you say, so let's get down to the nitty-gritty, okay? - Please shuffle the cards. (cards shuffling) This is for the past. Now cut the cards with your left hand. Now draw 13 cards. Cartomancy is as old as the cards themselves. In fact, their first use was in divination. And I think you will be rather surprised at their accuracy. You were born of a wealthy family. Your childhood was extremely unhappy. I think your parents separated when you were six. You and your mother moved to the country where you spent a number of lean years until your father died and named you sole heir to his estate. After graduating from an elite college, you met and fell in love with a handsome young man who got you to invest in a country in South America. - Which was non-existent. All this is public record. You knew I was coming. You could've planned this whole thing beforehand. - He had black hair, brown eyes, liked champagne, and green cigars. - Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop. - My child, all mortal flesh is subject to such wounds. And I dare say, we all have given up our heart's blood at sometime in life. - I'm sorry. I really am. Can you help me? - Perhaps. Let's finish the reading. - I've traveled all over the world, looking for something. I never found it. - Well- - Only boredom. - [Madam Von Kirst] I think we can change all that, but it will be more dangerous than you can possibly imagine. - [Yvonne] I don't care. I don't care at all. Anything would be better than this. (airplane roaring) - [Madam Von Kirst] Very well. It is decided. - [Yvonne] But what should I do? - [Madam Von Kirst] You will take another trip. However, this time, things will be quite different. - [Yvonne] I don't understand. What am I supposed to do? - [Madam Von Kirst] The forces that will guide you are already at work. You will make the right decision at the proper moment. This, I can promise you. (gentle music) - Juan is beginning to act strangely. The four girls who must be present, according to Madam Von Kirst, hopefully, will respond to these invitations. This is the first step to release the DeLorca name from this abominable curse. (eerie music) Now, it's up to Perro. (dramatic music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) Perro. Perro. Yes, you can keep your pet. The four girls we've chosen, remember? The four girls. (water splashing) (birds chirping) (water splashing) (birds chirping) (women screaming) - What's it say, Dana? - Free guided tour Casa DeLorca. Charming home of the DeLorca family. A historic masterpiece. Tour begins promptly at 7:00 p.m. - [Man] See you later this afternoon. - [Waiter] Okay. Stay out of trouble. - [Man] Right. - Another drink, miss? - Yes, please. Oh, waiter. Where is this, Casa DeLorca? - Oh, that's just down the street. Three blocks. On your right. You can't miss it. It's the biggest house here. - Oh, yes. I think I know the one you mean. - You know, I've never been up there myself and I don't know anyone who has, but, well, confidentially, it just might be worth your while to meet young, rich Mr. DeLorca himself. You get what I mean? (ominous music) - Excuse me. Would you please move? (Laura sighs) (camera snapping) Whatever it is you're selling, I'm not buying. Now, can I take my picture? (eerie music) Oh, all right. (camera snaps) (dramatic music) (ominous music) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (door knocking) - Isn't there anyone else here? (tense music) - Hi. - Hi. - You our guide? - Heavens, no, just another tourist. - Oh. - Don't everybody talk at once. - [Yvonne] Who gave you girls your invitation? - Wasn't exactly an invitation. It's kind of a note. Wait a minute. Here it is. - Yes, it's the same as mine. - Did that funny little man give you yours? - He sure did. I wonder who he was. You don't suppose he's our guide? - Wasn't he creepy? (Vickie gasps) Oh! You scared me. Where did you come from? - From out of the ancient past. I'm Mr. DeLorca. Welcome to our home. I'm to be your guide for this evening's tour. - We didn't mean- - Well, that's not necessary. You are Miss... (gentle guitar music) So many questions. - But I'm a reporter. - I have a question. - [Carlos] What's that? - Earlier, you mentioned "our home." Is there perhaps another Mr. DeLorca? - [Carlos] Yes, I lived here with my nephew Juan. He'll be disappointed not to have shared this evening with so lovely an audience. - Well, your home is just divine. I'm looking forward to meeting your nephew. - Shh. There was so much to see. - Sure was. - Miss Laura, I do hope your photographs will be satisfactory. - [Laura] I'm sure they'll be just great. - Now I must ask for payment. - Thought this was free? - Mm, not quite. Payment is that you lovely ladies be my guests at dinner tomorrow night and meet my nephew Juan. (water splashing) - [Laura] That's it. Now, lean forward just a little. - [Guy] This okay? (camera snapping) Then what happened? (camera snaps) - He invited us all for dinner. (camera snaps) That old house could be a photographer's paradise. (camera snaps) I might even find a client for my pictures. (camera snaps) - You're not going, are you? (camera snaps) - Why not? - For one thing, you have a date with me. At least you said so yesterday. What do you think I'm sticking around for? - [Laura] I simply couldn't guess. - Look, Laura, I'm serious. I thought, well, damn it, I thought we really hit it off together. - Me too. - What do you think about dinner at Mr. DeLorca's? - Might as well. Dinner's dinner. (ominous music) - Isn't that Laura? - Yeah, and look what she's got. Hey, Laura! - Hi! Those are two of the girls I told you about. - Oh, yeah. DeLorca place. And do I get to meet them? - Uh-uh, lover boy. I'll see you later. Bye. - Is it a date or not? - Okay, but make it late! - 10 o'clock at the cafe. - [Laura] I'll be there! - [Man] About ready to leave? - [Guy] Yeah! - Hi. - Hi. - [Vickie] He's beautiful. Any more like him around? - He's been sweet the last few days. - Are you going to dinner at Mr. DeLorca's tonight? - I thought I'd turn a little business into pleasure. - Good. We're going too. Can we give you a lift somewhere? - Thank you. (ominous music) - [Dana] Dinner was delicious. - Thank you. - You're a marvelous host. I can't understand why you're still single. - [Carlos] More Cognac? - [Dana] No thank you. - You haven't answered my question. - About marriage? Perhaps I've never met the right woman. - Who wants to get married? I want to have fun. - I agree with Vickie. I'm more interested in a career than marriage. - [Carlos] What's your opinion? - Oh, I'm sure I'll get married someday. But right now, the thought of having children frightens me. The responsibility and all. - You mention children. I do believe that a family heritage should be passed on through a son. - I imagine every man does. But first, there's love and marriage. - [Yvonne] Love? What's love? - Love, lust, what's the difference? Marriage just makes it legal. Mr. DeLorca, do you mind if I take a picture of the drawing room? - [Carlos] No, by all means. - Excuse me. Oh, that's not necessary. (gentle music) - Table for one? - No, no thank you. I'll just sit at the bar. - [Waitress] All right. (Guy sighs) - Scotch Moore, please. (crickets chirping) - Can I get you anything? - [Dana] Nothing for me. Thank you. (eerie music) - She's fine. Let her enjoy herself. - Here's to love, and here's to lust. - [Dana] Mr. DeLorca? - Yes? - [Dana] What about Perro? - Perro has been with us since childhood. His father was a poor casket maker and a widower. I had occasion to purchase a casket. On that sad day, I arrived only to find their quarters being consumed by fire. (fire roaring) Perro's father was trapped inside. Then Perro somehow managed to escape, but not unharmed. I inquired about relatives, but there weren't any. - Mr. DeLorca, I've had a wonderful evening, but I really must leave. - [Carlos] So early? - I have an appointment. I'm sorry, but I did promise. - I understand. Will you excuse me a moment? - [Laura] Goodnight, all. - [Dana and Vickie] Goodbye. - You about ready to leave? - Let's not being impolite. I wonder how Yvonne's feeling. - Yeah, and I wonder what they're doing. - We better go find them. (eerie music) - Your appointment, a young man, perhaps? - Yes. - Not too serious, I trust? - Well, we really hadn't spent that much time together. - Perro will show you through the grounds. Goodnight. Goodnight. - Goodbye and thank you again for a lovely evening. - She's out. - Did she have that much to drink? - [Dana] She hardly touched her dinner. Yvonne? - [Vickie] Yvonne. (gentle music) - [Dana] Yvonne? - Yvonne. - What have we here? - She's had too much to drink, I think. - We'll put her to bed. She'll be fine tomorrow. - To bed here? - Certainly. Would disgrace her to carry her out, and we have many spare rooms. - I know you're right, but I hate to leave her here alone. - Of course. You'll stay here with her. - Would you like to be left alone in a strange house? - Well, no. - He's right, we should stay. Thank you, Mr. DeLorca. You're very considerate. - That settles it. (gentle music) (gentle guitar music) (gentle guitar music) - What's the matter, buddy? Girlfriend stand you up? - Looks like it. - Another drink? - Still have some. Thanks. Say, you know anything about a place here called the DeLoga, DeLorca, something like that, House? - Yep, the DeLorca House. Nobody ever asks about that place. Now you're the second person since yesterday. - Isn't it a tourist attraction? - No, not unless there've been some big changes. Nobody ever goes up there. And I've been around this town one hell of a long time. - My girl's over there. She and three other girls. You telling me maybe I should be worried? - No. I mean, it's just strange that nobody ever found out that he was opening up for tourists, that's all. Come to think of it, that place is kinda strange, anyway. - Come on now, say what you're trying to say. - Well, what I'm trying to say is... Well, listen, nobody ever took those old tales seriously about the DeLorca family having a curse on it. Supposedly, the master of the house has to pick a girl for a bride and when the first child is born, she dies. And I know it sounds weird, but I'm just telling it the way I heard it. (suspenseful music) - Some vacation. Boring, boring, boring. (Vickie sighs) (switch clicks) (crickets chirping) (gate rattling) - Wear this. Wear this, Perro. It will protect you. Now, stand outside and let no one in. No one, you understand? No one. My dear, it distresses me to make you an unwilling party to something that is of no concern to you. If I could've avoid it, I should've done so. But let me explain. My grandfather was involved in summoning up spirits from the netherworld. Something went wrong. Someone, or something, interrupted him and he lost control. You see, when one undertakes the task of conjuring spirits, one is involved in a power struggle between enormous forces of good and evil. You must balance one against the other in order to control either. Any interruption or error in ceremony can destroy this balance and release things that are beyond human comprehension. I'm about to perform a conjuration which will allow Yvonne to conceive a child. Unfortunately, you are needed as an altar. (crickets chirping) (eerie music) - [Laura] No. (Laura gasps) (eerie music) No. No. No. (Laura gasps) (eerie music) (Laura gasps) (Laura screams) (Laura whimpering) - Do not worry. No harm will come to you. No harm will come. No harm. (eerie music) You will not remember. My god, I hope I'm right. (crickets chirping) (ominous music) (both grunting) (both groaning) (eerie music) (both grunting) (both groaning) (body thuds) Perro! Perro! - Laura! - Help! Perro, help! (Guy grunting) (Carlos groaning) - It's me. (Laura moaning) There's got to be another way out of here. - [Carlos] Someone, or something, interrupted him and he lost control. You see, when one undertakes the task of conjuring spirits, one is involved in a power struggle between enormous forces of good and evil. You must balance one against the other in order to control either. Any interruption or error in ceremony can destroy this balance and release things that are beyond human comprehension. (eerie music) (Dana groans) (eerie music) (mysterious music) - [Vickie] Dana! (Vickie squealing) (Yvonne sighs) (Yvonne sighs) - My head. (Perro grunting) (Vickie squealing) (suspenseful music) (door creaks) (dramatic music) (Yvonne screams) (door rattling) (tense music) (Yvonne gasps) Dana! Dana! Dana?! Dana! Dana! (Yvonne screams) No! (Yvonne crying) Please stop! Please stop. (Yvonne crying) Please, please. No, no, no! - There. - No, please! - There, it's all right now. - No. - It's all right. - Oh, it's you. Do you know what's been going on around this place? - You had nightmare. - Nightmare? - I found you wandering about the house. You must've been walking in your sleep. - But I couldn't have. I couldn't have. - There, please, please. It's all right. - Oh, it was horrible. - It's all right. You're safe now. - Please help me. - You're very tired. Rest now. Sleep. - Yes. Very tired. - Sleep. - Sleep. - Sleep. There is no hope. You will be my wife and carry my child. The curse must be fulfilled. (eerie music) - [Guy] Thank God you're all right. - Oh, I was so scared. - [Guy] Don't worry, everything's gonna be all right. (eerie music) (door thudding) (Laura screams) (door thudding) - No! (Laura screams) No. No! (Guy grunting) (door thudding) Here. - I can't hold it! - [Laura] Guy, the knife. (monster groans) (Guy grunting) (Laura screams) (monster groaning) (machete thuds) (Laura screams) (Guy screams) Oh! (monster groaning) (Laura screaming) No! No! (monster groaning) (Laura screaming) (eerie music) (eerie music) (Yvonne groaning) (door opens) (eerie music) (door closes) - I'm sorry, but when the ceremony was interrupted, there was nothing I could do. Poor Perro being weak of will was completely under the control of forces he didn't know how to deal with. If the blame for this must rest on anyone, it must be on my shoulders. - You're all mad. I don't believe this is happening. It's too horrible. I just want to leave. I won't tell anyone. I just want to go. - But you don't understand, the curse is being fulfilled. I have failed in your carrying his child. - I can't bear it. I'd kill myself rather than to have a thing growing inside of me. - There is still hope. I've written to a friend and I trust she will be able to help us. - No. Please, no. I don't want anything more to do with this. - I'm sorry, you have no choice in the matter. I must ask you to remain until Madam Von Kirst arrives. (eerie music) I don't think she fully understands. - I can well imagine. Must've been a terrible experience for her. Could take months for her to properly recover. - I have assured her that the incantation will remove the curse completely from the child. Seems to calm her. - Yes, that's good. I think no matter what happens, it will be best to let her think all is well. You must keep her isolated until she gives birth. Now, I think it will be best if I work alone. - [Carlos] Of course, of course. (eerie music) (Madam Von Kirst speaking in foreign language) - I summon the evil from within to be expelled. Mr. DeLorca. She is not yet awake. And we will not be able to tell whether I have been successful or not until the child is born. I have seen to it that your nephew Juan and the girl Dana will remain in their coffins until I return. Do not, under any circumstances, allow anyone to enter the room where they sleep. (gentle music) It's all right, my child. Everything has been taken care of. - A couple of guys were hunting early this morning. They found her. I think those rains we had last week kinda dug her out. Well, how long you figure she's been dead, Doc? - Oh, about seven or eight months. You can tell the morgue crew to take her away now, Lieutenant. There's nothing more we can do here. - [Lieutenant] Mm. (eerie music) (gentle music) - [Yvonne] Months now, I've been in this dreary room. Perro brings me food each day. I have become a little less frightened of him. If only I could get him to trust me, to take me out for a walk, anything. I could try to escape. I must escape. Thank God Laura got away. I know now I've been chosen to pass on the curse of the DeLorca blood. The truth of that realization grows within me each day. Oh, god, to be the mother of a vampire's child... And after the baby comes, then what? Will they kill me? Or will I become like Dana, a saint? I've got to escape or die. Either way, it doesn't matter anymore. (gentle music) (lock clicking) Perro? Perro? Perro, I've got to get out of here. - Mm. - Take me for a walk. Take me out for walk in the hallway, anywhere, please. I've got to get out of here. Please, I can't stand anymore. Please take me outside, please. Please, just for a walk. Just a little while. Please, Perro. Please. Please. Please take me for a walk. (Yvonne crying) (ominous music) (eerie music) (ominous music) (Yvonne panting) (eerie music) - [Carlos] Since it's too late to save Juan, who has now been totally transformed, I must save the child. If the curse has been broken, my last remaining task will be to destroy Juan and Dana. (coffin door creaks) (ominous music) - [Madam Von Kirst] I have seen to it that your nephew Juan and the girl Dana remain in their coffins until I return. Do not, under any circumstances, allow anyone to enter the room where they sleep. (coffin door creaks) (eerie music) (eerie music) (Dana panting) - No. Mr. DeLorca! - No! The child. The child! (Dana grunts) (Yvonne screams) (eerie music) (Yvonne crying) (tense music) (Yvonne sobbing) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) I had to. The child. (Yvonne crying) - [Yvonne] Help! No! (Yvonne screaming) (Juan groaning) - Juan! (Juan groaning) Juan! (dramatic music) Yvonne! Yvonne! (dreadful music) (crickets chirping) (eerie music) Have we been successful? - Just a moment. I want to read this thoroughly. There are many steps we must follow. I want to be certain that we have taken every one of them. (somber music) (mirror breaks) We followed every order as indicated in these instructions. - Then you think there's hope? - Yes, I'm certain the child will be born normal. - Thank God this hellish nightmare is over. That poor, poor girl. After all she's been through, how much can a human being endure? I must tell her that everything will be all right. - Yes, she is a lovely child. I'd like to be there when you tell her. (eerie music) - Yvonne? (door knocking) Yvonne? Yvonne? (lock clicks) We have wonderful news. The child will be born normal. (eerie music) (dramatic organ music)
