[Kyle] My rise to the top of the Haden High School food chain happened faster than a three-second Snapchat. But it wasn't always that way. A few weeks ago, I was just like you, then I updated my status and some pretty strange things began to happen. I feel like I owe everyone an explanation, so here it is. Oh, and by the way, I don't play hockey. Or at least I didn't, until a few weeks ago. Oh, come on, kid. Knock-knock, I'm invading your privacy. Come on, get up! You're gonna be late for your first day of school. Ugh, it smells like a wet dog in here. - [Kyle] See that guy? - Hey! [Kyle] That was me not so long ago. Listen, you need to finish putting this room together so when you get home from school today, I want you to start unpacking, all right? - Breakfast in ten. - Wait, wait, Mom, Mom! I don't think I feel so good. Yeah, right. [call ringing] - Hey, bud, howyou doing? - Hey, Dad. Sorry for hitting you up so early. Did I wake you? Aw, please, don't worry about it. I had to get up early. Giant swells this morning. - Everything okay? - This place sucks. I wish I could be there with you. Listen, you just gotta hang tough till summer, okay? Then you're gonna be right back here in Cali with me. - I love you, Pop. - I love you, too, man. Hang in there, all right? Whoa! - Oh, well, sorry about that. - Gramps! Still getting used to having people in the house. Yeah, yeah, I'll come back later. - [phone dings] - [Ann] Don't play with the phone now. I'm not playing, I'm swiping. - Swiping? - Yes. Get that app off your phone, young lady. Put it on my phone, though. Dude, you're gonna wear that on the first day of school? This isn't Huntington Beach. Okay, eat up. The bus will be here in ten minutes. I don't know why I couldn't bring my car. Dad said he'd pay to have it shipped. Well, I love that money is no object for your father because he doesn't make any. Your dad's need to relax has gotten in the way of him finding any kind of work. I get it, you guys are mad at me. But just bear with me and just trust me. I have a plan. This is better for all of us, all right? [sighs] Hey, bro! You need to drop the teen angst act. Mom and Dad are over. This is the new normal. Accept it. Look, they're only separated. They're not getting a divorce. She moved 3,000 miles to get away from him. To me, that screams divorce, but then again, I'm a realist. [Kyle] No surf, no Dad, no car, senior year in Connecticut. Twenty three? Room 23? Does anybody know where Room 23 is? Sorry, man, my bad. Hey, do you guys know where Room 23 is? Cool skateboard. - Thanks. - Twenty-three? - Yeah. - Isn't that East wing, guys? - Yeah, I got a class there. - It's on the other side of the school. I really appreciate it, dude. - Not a problem... dude. - [laughing] Come on, come on, where is it? [girl singing] ♪ The fourth the fifth ♪ ♪ The minor fall The major lift ♪ ♪ The baffled king composing Hallelujah ♪ [bell rings] - Hi. - [Miss Stacey] Hi. - Sorry, I'm late. - Well, Mr... Kyle Moore. Kyle Moore, I really hope this isn't how the rest of the year is going to go. - Mmm-hmm. - Please have a seat, Kyle. Great. [bell rings] [sighs] Hey. Hi. I saw you singing earlier, you were, you were great. I was a little flat, but, thank you. - I'm Kyle. - I'm Dani. [chuckles] - Are you trying to make me jealous? - [sighs] Brian, this is Kyle. Kyle, this is Brian Massey. Hey, man? Are you making a play on my girl, Spray Tan? Brian, I'm not your girl, okay? You're gay. Thirty-seven percent technically ain't gay, baby and you were flat again today. Do you wanna win the Slam, or not? Yes! Of course, I want to win the Slam. Well, then, mediocrity isn't gonna cut it. Okay, I'm not taking my shirt off. I cannot lose that much water-weight again. You need to step it up. Are you wearing women's jeans? No. Yes, my stylist picked them out. Dude, you don't have a stylist. Okay, H&M had a flash sale, I blacked out. Later, Kyle. Don't even think about it. But you can think about this. [indistinct chatter] Hey, Kyle, looks like you're acclimating nicely. This is my boyfriend, Xing-Fu. Xing, Mr Unpopular here is my brother, Kyle. [in Mandarin] Where are you from in China? Oh, no, he's from Connecticut. His real name's Donald. But he only speaks Mandarin, because he's so in tune with his Chinese roots. Let's go, Fu. What are you doing at my table? - Sorry, I didn't know it was yours. - Well, it is, so beat it. Wait, wait, no, no, no, no! Kidding, I'm kidding. You thought I was serious? That was awesome. [snickers] No, I'm not... I'm not a fighter. I know I look intimidating, but no, I've never been in a fight. That's not true. When I was in third grade, this girl kicked me in the eggplant emoji and I just, uh, fell down and cried, and pee'd a little. - Thanks for sharing that with me. - Yeah. Are you really from California? - Yeah, I really am. - That is gnarly. [chuckles] Is that how you say "gnarly"? - Sure. - I've always wanted to go to California, just skateboard, you know? Like, down the Venice boardwalk and, like, hang out with Snoop Dogg, you know? Straight Outta Compton-style, except without, you know, the smokies, because I have asthma. But anyways, I can't go, because I sunburn easily and I'm not really athletic. I'm talking a lot, sorry. My name's Lonnie. [chuckles] Oh, fist bump. - Sorry. - Bro. - But everyone calls me Grimace. - Why Grimace? Oh, because everyone thinks I look like him. I don't see it, dude. Uh, dude. I sound like a Californian. Yo, Grimace? Hey, Derek. I got a B-plus on my history paper. - Yeah, that's not good. - That's unacceptable. Stop eating, start studying. Got it, dude. You do that guy's homework? Yeah, Principal Kim makes me "tutor" him. [snickers] He's the best hockey player in Connecticut. [Lonnie] He scored more goals in two periods than any other high schooler in history. He's got a YouTube channel and I hear pros are watching him. And then there's Charlotte, Derek's girlfriend. Hottest girl in the whole school. The queen of Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook. She's got like half a million followers on Instagram. Queen of all the hockey groupies. They're expected to win the state championship. We haven't w on in like 20 years, so it's all because of that guy. Yeah, well, I'm not a hockey fan. Me, neither, but figure skating's cool. I mean, whatever. - Yo, Grimace! - What? [all gasp and laugh] [in sing-song] Chocolate money shot! [Lonnie] You got your milk all over my titties. [chuckles sarcastically] Did I forget to mention he has a really accurate slap shot? He's good. Do I have anything in my face? Oh, you got a little something. uh, right... here. [bell rings] [phone dings] [Derek] Yo, Point Break! Hey. Come on, man. I'm just messing with you. All right? It's nothing personal. We just do it to all the new kids. So, uh, we cool? Kyle! Look out! Five minutes for cross checking! How's that locker feel, Point Break? [laughs] [Oliver] Oh, Cali! Hey, come on, give me my phone back. Oh, you wanna call your mommy, Point Break? Oh, you can actually use my phone. [chuckles] - Give it back. - Too slow. They didn't teach you any hockey in Cali? Come on, Cali Boy! Give me my phone back. Whoa, they teach you manners in California? All you gotta do is say please. Please? That wasn't so hard, was it? Here, take it back. [students gasp] Nice phone, you might want to get that looked at, pussy. [Kyle] Mortal enemy, check. Hey, man, do you fix phones? [humming] You're tryin' to lock me into a lot of dos and don'ts right now, you beautiful angel. Let me tell you something, in a former life, I was a wolf. Hm, cool. Mmm. Mmm. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Your chi is way off. Your chakras are not aligned. You know what I'm saying? The feng is not shui-ing. Uh-huh. Can you fix my phone or not? Yeah, I can fix your phone. Let me see it. Okay. Yeah, say goodnight. This thing's done. You've "Insta-ed" your last gram, tweeted your last twit. I know, you left your whole life behind, and you're pissed. And the kids around here, in pistachio khakis? They don't really comprendo a surfer dude like you. Am I right? Or am I right? - How did you know that? - [laughs] Because I'm here to lighten the load, baby. [hums] Listen, why don't you tell me what I can do to make your life a little more Namaste. [sighs] I don't know. I just... I want things to be different. [breathes sharply] Let's fly. Do it with me. - I'm not gonna do that. - Then nothing's gonna change. Don't be scared. Come on. Yeah, yeah. There you go, fly. Close your eyes. Do you know what's below you? All the haters, and they're pointing and they're saying, "Look at that beautiful, blond bird with well-conditioned hair." You know what I'm saying? [cawing] That was intense, man. How do you feel? - Embarrassed. - Great, me too. I want to show you something. Take a look at this. It's my own social media app. It's called U-NIVERSE. When you look at this screen, man, what do you see? A blank page? You're cute, but you are so stupid. This is you, dude. Not the "you" you are, the "you" you want to be. You can be anybody. You just gotta fill this page, a new beginning, you know what I'm saying? Because when you put positive vibes out in the universe, the universe listens. Give me your hand. Give me your beautiful, soft hand. Take this and go... to your destiny. Thanks. [call rings] [phone chimes] Ah. [phone vibrates] [sighs] We're all made of energy, me and you. You've gotta be kidding me. [man continues on phone] Your mom and dad... Oh, whatever. [ominous music playing] All you gotta do is fill the screen, baby. [phone dings] - [door opens] - Pants up, hands where I can see 'em. - What do you want? - I need to borrow your balcony. My window's painted shut, and I need to sneak out. Where you goin'? Xing-fu's taking me to an Anime and Chill party. Mmm. What are you doing tonight? That's right, nothing. See ya. [snickers] [sighs] [snoring] [alarm rings on phone] Good morning. Just warming up the pipes, don't mind me. [laughs] [exclaims in disgust] - Good morning, Sunshine. - Good morning. You might want to take a look outside. Is that my car? That just showed up on a truck. [Kyle] Yes! I can't believe it. That's my car! Yes, it is, and I can't believe it. There's no way. Where's Dad? [Ann] Probably tanning on a beach somewhere and look, you need to get a job, so you can pay for the gas but I will help you with the insurance. Okay. Oh, I knew he'd come through. Yes! [indistinct chatter] Yeah, I thought about trying out for the hockey team, but my physician said that I have the ankle strength of a ten-year-old girl. [laughs] But you know, multiplayer, online gaming is my real passion. It can get pretty physical, too. Like one time, I passed out after 17 straight hours of Warcraft. - Really? - Yeah, dehydration. I went to the doctors and I woke up in the ER. And then, I met my girlfriend through League of Legends. [sighs] She's a bikini model, her name's Guadalupe. Hey, Lonnie, can I ask you something? Have you ever heard of an app called U-NIVERSE? No, and I'm on everything, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest. Sure, I only have two followers. It's my mom and my granny, and my dad blocked me for some reason. That's weird. Why would you block your own son, right? I haven't talked to him about that... Wait, wait, what's U-NIVERSE? It's just something I read about. Gotta go, see ya'. Cool, nothing. Thanks for starting that conversation. I'll tell Guadalupe about that. [chuckles] She's my girlfriend. Guadalupe is my girl. No one cares? Are you on Twitter?

There, yes, you're one, certainly. Yes, you were terrible. Okay? Thanks, gang, have a good day. All right, Dani, Brian, I'm gonna need you up on stage. Band and chorus, we got nine weeks to do this. Not a lot of time. Excuse me, um, sorry. I'm here to audition. Okay, and you are? - I'm Kyle Moore. - Are you a singer, Mr Moore? Yeah, uh, I'm classically trained. [Mr Moody] You're classically trained? [Kyle] Yep. Okay, everybody sit down, we're gonna do one more up here. You know where the stage is? - It's this thing. - Yeah. Have a go at it. Hoo. All right, hey, what will you be singing? - Singing? - Yeah. Uh... it's a surprise, even to me. I usually just let my inner rock-star do whatever he's feeling. Your inner rock-star? Yeah. Yeah. [bearded man] We're all just made of molecules, man. We're just energy. All you have to do is soar! [singing opera music] [Mr Moody laughs hysterically] What the hell? [continues laughing] Quite a surprise, Mr Moore. My God, that's the craziest thing I've ever seen. You must be a very lonely person. - Come back when your balls drop. - [all laughing] Au revoir, mademoiselle. Seriously, come back when your balls drop. [laughter continues] Dude, I am freaking out! You gotta tell me what the deal is with the... Dude? Dude? Hey, dude. Dude! Huh? Oh. I remember you. You're the angry kid with no friends. Yeah, stay with me here, listen. That U-NIVERSE app you put on my phone, it's insane. It worked. The things that I wished for happened. Right. Some things that I wished for didn't happen the way that I wanted them to. - I know. - Well? - Let me ask you a question. - Yeah. If a unicorn wrote a tweet and then posted it and then he put it up and deleted it and then a tree fell down in the forest, - does anybody even hear it? - What are you talking about? Listen, that U-NIVERSE app, can you tell me how to control it? Can you tell me if I can take back something that I posted? What do you want to take back? [clears throat] [singing opera] Whoa, dude! That's what you wished for? - Listen to me, man. - What? You can't change the past, that's crazy talk. - Is this forever? - Me and you? No, no! I'm talking about the app. - Oh, the app. - Y es! - All I know is this. - Y eah. The universe is changing thousands of times every second. You just gotta update your status. Update my status. [Kyle] Update my status, the universe will assist. My man! Dad? What's up? - Hey. - Hey. I can't believe you're here. - [laughs] - What are you doing here? Ah, dude, I don't even know. I woke up and I was like, "I gotta get out of here. I gotta go. I gotta go," so I just did. I don't know, I got on a plane. - Boom, I'm here. [laughs] - Wow. Hey, why aren't you driving Born to Run? - Mom says I have to get a job first. - Heard that before. Listen, grab a sponge, all right? Can't have ladies getting in a dirty ride. - You got it. - [laughs] So tell me something, what's been happening? Oh, you don't even know. I've been skating and surfing every day, 12 hours a day sometimes. Hey! [laughs] Anna Banana, how are you doing? Hey, killer, [clears throat] you want to give us a second? Yeah. - What are you doing here? - You look great. I forgot what those scrubs do to you. [snarls] [laughs] So great. I'm telling you, these waves were topping out like at 30 feet. 30 feet! That's like as big as this house! I mean, that's huge! I don't think you truly appreciate how big this is. Annie, give them the arm wave, show them, show them. All right, this is me on my board, right? This is the 30-foot wave. Look at that! This is to scale, Maxi. Ugh! Ugh! Shred! Shred! Bleed! Bleed! Pull, snap through. Thanks, Ann. And they were just coming, one after the other and I surfed them, all day long. All day, Allen! Into the evening, even. And then I fell asleep to the sounds of that angry ocean just pounding the beach. [mimics pounding] [grunts and laughs] It was pretty great. Wake up the next day and we did it all again. What? [laughs] It was one of the best times I've ever had in my entire life. Except for the time... you and I rebuilt the Alpha Romeo. That was the best time I ever had in my life. - Hey, agreed! Born to Run! Whoo! - Born to Run! Cheers to that, my man. Well, it's good to have you back, Dad. Now Kyle has a shoulder to cry on. Maxi, chill out. So, Darryl, what do you plan on doing for work here? Well, I connected with an old skate buddy of mine who's got his own brand out here in New Haven. He's gonna hook me up with a job doing graphics. It's a real job. So I hit the ground running tomorrow. But tonight, I just want to say that I am so happy to be here hanging out with that sexy, little surfer chick I met 22 years ago. Do you remember that girl, Anna Banana, I think her name was? - Sort of. - Anna Banana. [laughs] Annie, Kyle, Maxi, I love you guys. There's no other place in the universe I'd rather be. [all] Cheers. [Darryl] Cheers, Allen. [Kyle] So what did I do? What would you do? All right, U-NIVERSE, let's make some moves. Thank you, Doris. - I want another shot. - Huh? I want another shot. Uh, you want a Castrato role now? I don't think you're gonna like the requirements very much. [in sing-song] You suck! - See? That's how it's actually done... - [Mr Moody snickers] because I'm actually classically trained. All right? Now get out of here. [music playing] Hey, can I borrow that? One, two!

That would be me, the lactose intolerant one. Can't drink milk, because it goes through me like lava through a Philippine village, just... [blows raspberry] Just really thick. Would you like to go out sometime? No, thanks. Is it because of the diarrhoea? Brian's here. Let's go, outside, you and me, right now. Brian, just go away. You no longer have the privilege of speaking to me. And when I'm selling out the Garden, you'll all be kissing my waxed, platinum butt cheeks. - Brian! - Zip it, Gigi Had-da-da! - All right, that's it! - Kyle, don't, this is stupid. No, it's okay. Let's go. Brian! Brian, don't do this. Kyle! Guys, come on. One rule, no touching my face. This is my money maker. [groans] Whoa. I am so gonna cream you. [gags] Be like water making its way through cracks. - [Brian] You're dead! - Kyle! Ooh! [all clamouring] Point taken. I'm good. - Here you go, Gramps. - Thank you. Hey, Anime, I don't know what's going on with this look, - but I am digging it, big time. - [clicks tongue] Our daughter is wearing a dog collar. Darryl, um, how was your first day? It went well. Yeah, it's just a wait-and-see game now. What do you mean, wait and see? I thought you said you had the job. I do, I do. I just had to meet my boy's partner. Big dog and pony show, you know how it is. Don't worry, I got the job, okay? Hey, killer, what gives? We were supposed to meet at the skate park. You stood me up. Sorry about that, I got caught up. - He got into a fight. - [Ann] You got in a fight? - Yeah, oh, yes. - Maxi. You dropped him like a bad habit, too, didn't you? - It wasn't a big deal, Mom. - Um, it is a big deal. What is wrong with you? Why are you fighting? Relax, okay? There's nothing wrong with him. There's not a scratch on him. He's looking good, he's walking tall. I taught my son not to act like that. Well, apparently he does, and he wins. Give me some. [grunts] Mom, I'm fine, and it won't happen again. - Can I be excused? - Where you going? Meeting up with a friend. [Maxi] Friends, singing in the chorus, fighting, you're not that cool, dude. Get out of here, have fun, enjoy your date. Thanks. Thank you, Dad. And try not to get in any fights. See what I did. Hey, hold on a second. Why don't you take the Alfa. - You're the best, Dad! - [laughs] I am the best. What? [sighs] Okay, where are we going? If you could do anything in the world, right now, what would it be? I would... ride a Ferris wheel. - Really? - Yeah, mmm-hmm. [laughs] - Why? - I love Ferris wheels. I've loved them ever since I was a little girl. Well, you're in luck. I just happen to know where one is. Oh, oh, no. - Oh, my God! - You like it? Oh, my God, this is so good. Where did it even come from? One night only... and it's all for us. - Come on. - [laughs] This is too good. [man] Hello. Well, hi. - Right this way. - Thank you. Thanks. [Dani] Whoo! This feels right. [laughs] - Whoo! - [Kyle] Yeah! - Whoo! - [Dani] Yeah! - Yeah! - This is so cool. Yeah, it is. Everything you wanted? [Dani] Oh, this is like the dream. I'm obsessed with this. - [laughs] - [Kyle] Oh, yeah. Hey, how do you like singing with our chorus? - I like it. - Yeah? I just wish we were singing something more now. - Yes. - Or at least 2003. Mmm-hmm. Mr Moody plays it so safe. It's probably why Hayden has never won the Slam. Hm. Man, it would feel so good just to win one time. We're gonna win the Slam this year. I promise. [power whirring down] This is the perfect fall night. [both laugh] - I've never seen fall before. - No. I'm from Huntington Beach. Well, you are in for a treat because nothing beats New England falls. Have you ever heard of the Heavenly Pursuit? - What's that? - [gasps] Okay, well, autumn is the time of year that the moon after pursuing the sun since spring, finally catches up to her, but then he out distances her and the whole pursuit begins again. It's kind of like two lovers who lose one another. But his love is so powerful that he spends his entire life trying to find her. That sounds kinda tragic. [chuckles] Yeah. I know, I'm a total sucker for a tragic love story. But I think every girl wants a moon. - Yeah. [chuckles softly] This has been the coolest night. Yeah. I don't get it. I've lived here my whole life and no one even knows who I am. Come on, that's not true. - Hi, Liza. - Who are you? Lonnie Gregory, your next door neighbour for the past 17 years. Doesn't ring a bell. Sorry. Of course not. Hey, thanks for not inviting me to your sweet 16. It was beautiful from what I saw from the window anyways. But that's what I mean, you. You show up four weeks ago and now your life is like this amazing fairy tale, right? I keep thinking about it. And it's a little annoying, actually, but in a good way. Okay, Lonnie, I have to tell you something. But you gotta promise me that you won't tell anyone. Promise? - Yeah, not even Mom. - You sure? You talk a lot. - I know I talk a lot. Just tell me. - Okay, okay. I have a magic app on my phone and whatever I post on it, comes true. - I'm sorry, what? What? - [mimics explosion] It's insane. Oh, my God! I have the same app. - I thought I was the only one. - Really? Yeah, no, dude! - Come on, you lost your mind. - Lonnie, I'm telling the truth. Okay, fine. If that was even a possibility, which I'm not saying that it is, how would that even work? I'll tell you. Okay, so my phone broke, so I took it to the mall to this bearded dude. - Bearded dude? - Bearded dude. He gave me a new phone with this app called U-NIVERSE on it. The universe is always eavesdropping. There's this unicorn and if the unicorn posts a tweet in the woods and then deletes the tweet, does it make a sound? Oh, man, you Californians, okay. I'm not crazy. I'm telling you the truth. It does sound crazy, - because it's bullshit, all right? - Lonnie! Look, if anyone understands the need for fantasy, it's me. I mean, I spend more of my time on Azeroth than I do on earth. But I don't try to convince people that I'm Archmage Khadgar the Wizard. Maybe you guys do things differently in California. Maybe it's the avocados, maybe it's the stuff everyone's smoking, you know what I'm saying? But we don't do things like that, no one... What is that? This is a gift. This is my favourite skateboard. - Cool. - And I want to give it to you. - What? - I want you to have it. - It's for you, come on. - That's so awesome. That's the nose, that's the tail, and those two bolts are what you stand on. Oh, I don't know, my ankles, remember? It's the height. - I'm afraid of heights. - Lonnie, get on the board. Okay, here I go, um... [screams] Sorry, sorry, sorry. [sniffs] You smell like avocados. You smell so good. What do you put in your hair? It's my hair's just... - You're good. - It's high up here. - Does anybody get a nose bleed? - You'll be fine. - How high up are we? - An inch. That's a lot. Just... What do I do now? You kick back and enjoy the ride. Oh, my God, I'm getting light hands, because it's so high. Whoa! What's going on? I'm not doing anything. Why is it taking off? Whoa, I'm actually skateboard... Get out of the way! - Whoo! - Look at me! Whoa, whoa! Did you see that? [laughs] Look at you rip, doggie! Whoo! Yeah! Dude, is that Grimace? It's me, Lonnie, you don't know my name, that's okay. [laughs] Yeah! Watch this. This is the coolest thing I've ever done! Like, by far! It's the best day of my life! [groans] - Lonnie! Lonnie! - [all groan] Lonnie! You all right, man? How many fingers? You have fingers. Come on, let's get you up. You gotta watch what you're eating... I mean, going. What are you doing? You could've hurt him. Well, it's not my fault he's fat and uncoordinated. Yeah? Well, if it's so easy... why don't you try it? Or are you just some pussy in a letter jacket? [students murmur] Look at me, I'm riding a skateboard. - What are you doing? - Who's the pussy now? - Watch this. - It's so easy. Whoa, what? Whoa, slow down. Yo, what is going on? Yo, guys, stop this. Yo, Oliver! Dude, hey, dude! Stop, stop! Move back away! [horn honking] [all gasping] Aren't you going to study for the Spanish test? I'm just gonna wing it. Okay, wow, you know, you are the only person I know that never studies and gets all As. - You write music? - Oh, it's nothing. - Sing something for me. - No. Okay, shut your face, it's not happening. Dani, I don't know! I've never heard of the game Truth or Dare before! What are you doing? My mom will hear you. - Dani, what are you doing? - Kyle, stop it! - Dani, what's going on up there? - Nothing, Mom! Nothing! - Stop it. You're a freak. - [snickers] Get over there. If you so much as roll your eyes, I swear I'll murder you. All right, cross my heart and hope to die. "Drowning?" Mmm-hmm, yes, I know, it sounds a little morbid, but it's really just a conversation between two people falling in love. Yeah, leave it to me to write a song that sounds like a eulogy. Whoa, wait, wait, wait, you gotta sing it for me. - No, Kyle, no, you know I'm not... - Just a few verses, please? Just a few verses, that's all I'm asking for. Agh.

I think I know what song is going to work. I know, but Dani wrote this song and it's tight, Mr Moody. Just hear it out. I'm sure it's very "tight". It's just that this song has a significance for me. - Why? - Because I sang it once. - What for? - Mr Pookins. Who's Mr Pookins? - My cat. - You sang a song for your cat? My dead cat. He died! I sang it at his funeral. Sorry. It was a suicide. Can we just play the song for you once, please? You won't regret it. - Do the short version. - Yeah.

What's even worse is the biggest game of the season is the same night as the Slam. I'll be so surprised if anybody even shows up. Hey, you all should go to the Slam! I'm telling you, if not, you'll miss out and you'll have to watch it on YouTube. - Yeah, go! - I'm telling you. You know, nobody but you could've got me to share my music. Thank you. I'm happy I met you. - I'm kind of happy I met you. - [chuckles] You're so dumb. [bell rings] I gotta go to class, bye. - Bye! - Later, gator. - Jesus. - Isn't that sweet? The lady and the tramp were about to have their first kiss. What's with you, Massey? I Google Chrome-d you and there's not a single mention of you singing anywhere before you came to Hayden. Something about you stinks, and I'm gonna figure it out. And then I'm gonna stuff and mount you. [Lonnie] All I'm saying is be careful. Things are rarely what they appear to be. Take my girlfriend from Honduras, the bikini model, Guadalupe? She turned out to be Phil from Cleveland. Yeah, I got catfished, without the TV show. What are you getting at? I'm saying we don't know anything about this bearded dude. What if he turns out to be some kind of like, you know, master of dark arts. Look, anything that got my family back together, can't be bad. Yeah, speaking of family, um, it's my birthday Saturday and every year, we go to my favourite place. It's a Greek restaurant. There's hummus and a belly dancer. - Hm. - Yeah, I took some lessons. She asked me to leave, but I'm wondering if you wanted to go, you could go, it's gonna be lame. - You probably... No, forget it. - Lonnie, of course, I'm coming to your birthday. - I wouldn't miss it. - Cool. All right, I'll text you all the deets and stuff. [all cheering] - That guy is such a douche. - Yeah, but he's Emperor Douche. And you just joined the chorus, so you're at the bottom of the barrel, too, you know? [Derek] Jealous, Chorus Boy? - No. - Hey! Oh, getting a little angry? No one cares about Kyle Moore. I own this school and there's not a damn thing you can do about it. Down boy. Jokes on him, this is how I eat my mashed potatoes, so... Somebody has to bring that guy in check. Yeah, somebody's gotta check him. It would be kind of cool if you went after the hockey team, though, right? Beat him at his own game? [gasps] Our own little miracle on ice. That would be so rad, dude. So rad! Yeah, it would. - [whistle blows] - Let's go! Let's go! [players yelling indistinctly] Come on! What are you, girls? Let's go! Come on, get up, you push! That's the best you got? - You skate like my sister. Bring it in! - [whistle blows] Two-on-two back check drill. If we're gonna beat the Bulldogs, we gotta get this right. Look who it is. - Set it up! - Whoa. Can l... [groans] Can I help you with something? I want a try-out, Coach. [all laughing] Try-outs are over, all right? That's too bad. I'm way better than Derek. Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's a pretty big claim, son. Let's hope you can back that up. The ice is yours. Can't wait to see this. No, U-NIVERSE, we're here to play hockey. No, no, no, no! Not again! [soft music playing] What are you doing? Whoa! Whoa! - [all laughing] - You can't even do that. I can't look away. That is so beautiful. - Holy smokes! - [players] Oh! [all cheering] Not what I meant. Well, kid, you're no Wayne Gretzy, but guess what you made the team. Boys, meet your new equipment manager. All right! Play time's over. Let's go! Set them up. Nice one, Cali. [groans] [sighs] Wayne Gretzky. Why didn't I think of that? [phone vibrates] Let's try this again, shall we? Hey, bitches! Where you going? I'm not done yet. Okay, Frozen... [laughs] Let's see you score on the goalie. Wreck him. Get the ice packs ready. Get him! [players yelling indistinctly] Come on! [all cheering] First line, get out there! Not you, Lowe, stay put. - How you feeling, baby? - I could go all night. Well, then get out there and take the face-off! Jeez! Come on! Come on! All right, whoo! How good is he? Okay, Kyle! What are you doing? Why aren't you out there? [Coach] Let's go. Come on, boys! [rock music playing] [all cheering] Kyle, you're so cool! - Hey. - What up? What are you wearing? It's pretty sweet, right? You'll never guess, I just saw a bunch of kids rocking my jersey! - Wow. - I can't believe it, it's insane. You know, you missed rehearsal this morning. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I couldn't sleep last night after the game. But it won't happen again. I'm a little worried you're not gonna have enough time for rehearsal now. You know that the Slam is the same night as the game. Dani, Chorus is way more important to me than hockey. I'll make it work. Dude! I got 2,000 likes on my last Instagram post. What? Every time I post something, I lose followers. Hey, so, my parents, they are super stoked to meet you Saturday. Yeah, I'm psyched to meet them, too, man. Yeah, this is funny, they actually don't think you exist. My dad sat me down the other day and he was like, - "Is this 'Kyle' another 'Gary Wiggins'?" - Who's Gary Wiggins? He was my imaginary friend when I was a kid. Not anymore, because he moved away. He didn't leave a forwarding address. Anyway, my parents are super excited that you're coming, so I'm stoked for them to see that you're real. - [door opens] - Moore! [laughs] What's up? Good, man, how are you? Moore, come sit with us, my man. We're celebrating tonight's win. That's all right. I'll catch up with you guys tomorrow. No, no, go with them. No, I gotta go home anyways and do some gaming. I'm a gamer, so... - You sure? - Yeah, no, celebrate. - Cool. Okay. - Yeah, go. - Come on. - Yeah. - There he is. - Yeah! So, where's Derek? Probably picking the splinters out of his ass from sitting all game. The Zamboni saw more ice than he did. Can I get you anything? Yes, I'll have a cheeseburger, fries and a shake. Oh, my God, Cassie, what are you gonna name your food baby? [chuckles] J-K, obviously, I'll just take a stick of celery, please. - Hi. - Hi? - I'm Charlotte. - Yeah, I know. Cool. So how's it feel to be the guy that everyone's talking about? I don't know if that's true. I bought a new perfume. Do you want to smell me? Uh... Yeah. I do. I mean, sure. [sniffs] Do you like it? [nervously] I love it. I'm not wearing any perfume. [chuckles] - Cassie's having a party this Saturday. - I am? Right, that party, of course, I am. Do you have plans? Saturday, no, I don't think so, no. Well, now you do. [hip-hop music playing] [all cheering] - What's up, man? - Where you been, bro? Everyone's out back. Come on, let's go, let's go. My man! Hey, you look thirsty. - Let's go. - Thanks. - No one told me it was a costume party. - [laughs] Don't worry about it, bro. - Boys! The man of the hour has arrived! - [all cheering] To hockey! One-timers, slap shots and kick saves! [all] Bone crushing hits that send opponents to their graves. Hat tricks, power plays and crosschecks. Hayden Hawks hockey, it's better than sex! [all cheering] Drink up, boys. It's the golden boy, the king of the ice. Just remember, ice breaks, and when it does, all these people are gonna do is hold your little, blond hair under the water. [all] Ew! [laughs] Don't worry about that. He's sore 'cause Charlotte cut him loose. Charlotte broke up with him? OMG! Are you gonna pay any attention to me tonight or what? Hey, Cassie, sick party. Do you like my costume? I'm a very naughty brave. Of course, I like it. I wore it last year. I don't remember th... Want to go for a walk? Yeah. - Damn, he just made Derek disappear. - I know. [Greek music playing] What? We thought you were over this. Kyle is real, Mom. Okay? He's not another Gary Wiggins. Of course, he's not. - So, you break up with Derek? - I think we just grew apart. I'm extremely driven, and I want the best of everything life has to offer, and Derek, well, he seems to be skating backwards. I have over five million social media followers. I take more AP classes than anyone else. And I'm a state champion tennis player. I don't even like tennis, it's boring. What about you? Do you want the best of everything life has to offer? Yeah, yeah, I guess, I do. Well, you're on your way. You have the looks, the grades, the popularity. You're just missing one detail. What's that? Me. Without me, you'll be idolized. But with me, you'll be deified. So, do you want me, Kyle? Because I want you. - [phone vibrating] - Sorry. Oh, no! I totally forgot. I gotta go, I'm so sorry. Our lives are made up of seemingly simple decisions. This decision, right here, right now, is one of yours. So you have to ask yourself, do you want to be a god or don't you? [phone camera clicks] Dani! - Dani, wait! - [grunts] Sorry. Hey, are you okay? That was a really cute picture Charlotte posted of the two of you. At least, I think it was you. I couldn't quite tell because she was practically swallowing your face. - I was gonna tell you, th... - Why? We're just buddies. You don't owe me anything. I'm happy for you, Kyle. You're the new Derek. Hey! Hey! I'm still me. Are you sure about that? Lonnie. Lonnie! Moore! Yeah, baby, let's go! Come on, now, kid! Moore, wake up! - I've seen better hands on a clock! - [whistle blows] Get your head out of your backside! Skate! Oh, come on! Congratulations, boys, that was the worst practise we have ever had! - What's up, Grimace? - Douche, Grimace. - Hey. - What do you want? Look, I'm sorry I missed your party, all right? You embarrassed me. I thought we were friends. We are. Look, you don't have to be the person people pick on any more. You want to go on your magic app and change me, too? Yes! Yes. You can be whoever, whatever you want. We can rule the school together. We can do whatever. I am who I want to be. You're the one who changed. You know what? You, and that thing... that's a virus. You've catfished yourself. [man on speaker] Alden residence. Kyle Moore... here. [doorbell rings] Hey. Oh, no, Kyle. What? What's wrong? You drove that old thing here? Charlotte, it's a classic Alfa Romeo. Hide it and take it around the back and park it with the help. Say something. [clears throat] So, Mr Alden, uh, Charlotte tells me you're a lawyer? Where did you say you were from again, Carl? It's Kyle, Daddy. California, sir. Sun-baked hippies. What does your father do for work? He was a professional skateboarder. Professional skateboarder. But now, well, he's an entrepreneur. Entrepreneur, that's a fancy word for unemployed. [clears throat] Kyle just got named captain of the hockey team. Brutish sport. I'm going to cut to the chase. You're a nice looking, young man. But the truth is, you're just not one of us. Daddy, he's the most popular boy at school! It's for the best, trust me, poopy. - Dad! - Can I use the bathroom? Masterson, show the boy to the washroom and make sure he doesn't steal anything. Now, poopy, don't pout, you'll give yourself wrinkles. Not one of you, huh? Let's see what you think of me now. So, how are we doing in here? Kyle! I was starting to miss you, son. Weren't we, Pet? We certainly were. Daddy? Are you feeling okay? Never been better. And Kyle, call me Dutch. Mr Alden sounds so stodgy. Well, Dutch, you are a bit stodgy. To be honest, I don't know how Kathy puts up with you. [both laughing hysterically] You son-of-a-gun. You're terrible. He's so awful, it takes me three of these just to get through dinner. She's ploughed 24/7. I'm so awful, I can't stand to be around me! Just trying to get away from myself. Hey, Masterson, can you stand me? Be honest. He hates my guts! I think it's time for dessert. Kyle, would you give me a hand in the kitchen? I'd love to. - Look. - Enough of that. You're the greatest. Now there's a real man. [sighs] Mmm, smells good. What's cooking, Kath? You and me. Mrs Alden, what are you doing? Let's run away together. Far, far away from here. Uh, your husband's in the other room. I love you. You need someone more flexible. I was a ballerina, you know. That's great, whoa! [groans] Oh, I like that game. This is out of control. This needs to stop right now. I'm totally out of control and I don't give a damn! - Hi, Pet. - No, no, no, stop! Hey! [groans] Come to me, my little pet. - Come to me! - [Kyle shrieks] - Mrs Alden, chill! - Just don't ever say no. Stop! Stop! Oh, oh, yes! Oh, baby! More... what? Okay. Come on, don't do this to me, U-NIVERSE! U-NIVERSE, come on, what are you doing? [Katherine] Kyle! Come back, Kyle! [car engine starts] - Take me with you! - [Kyle] Oh, God! - Take me to Paris! - Oh, you didn't! - Wear berets! - Oh, goodness! ♪ Frère Jacques Frère Jacques ♪ Send me nudes! Wait up, wait up! Two minutes. What? Uh, excuse me, ma'am? Excuse me, have you seen the bearded dude? Could you be a little more specific? Real weird, makes bird noises. He had a kiosk over here and he sold phones. Are you sure you're in the right mall? Because we don't allow sales carts in here. Yes, I'm in the right mall. I've seen him here twice! Sir, are you under the influence? I'm not even old enough to drink. I need the U-NIVERSE app! Sorry. [sighs] [Ann] You know, it's funny how everything you want to do always falls through. You sleep till noon every day. You're spending money that you don't even have. [whispering] Maxi? What's going on? They're fighting again. [Ann] And I know you didn't get that job. [Darryl] It fell through. I mean, seriously, what do you want me to do? Put in an application at the local coffee shop? Let me tell you something, that's never gonna happen because that ain't me, babe. I did not ask you to come here, but you came here on your own. I don't why. Do you want it to work? Show me that you're trying! You need to be responsible. Don't come at me with responsibility. You always do that. Listen, I know about responsibility, all right? - Oh, do you? - Yes. - Do you? - Yes. You know, Kyle still thinks that you wanted him to live with you, and I pulled him away from his dad and moved him across country, because I'm a bad person. And I don't dare tell him the truth, I don't dare. It would break his heart. I'm sick of covering for you all the time. I'm sick of being the bad person. Who took a dump in Anthony's trumpet? Nobody? Because that's what it sounded like. So let's try that again. One, two, three... [both singing] ♪ You took on the love And played the fool ♪ ♪ I found there's no getting over you ♪ ♪ And all this... ♪ [whistles] All right, the only problem I have with what you just did is that it sounded terrible. You know what? Whatever's going on between you two... figure it out, fast. All right, from the top, here we go. I'm sorry. I can't do this. You can't do it? It's your song. You wrote it! You're gonna have to do it without me. Wait. You shouldn't quit. I should. No, no, no, actually, you shouldn't quit, either. Neither should... stop quitting! Everybody stop quitting! The Slam is in five days, you cannot quit, Kyle. I just did. - [marching band playing] - [all cheering] [Principal Kim on speaker] Let's make some noise for Coach Milligan and our undefeated, hot hockey team! Thank you. Thanks. We came in second place last year. One point shy of our first trip to the state championship in 20 long, agonising years. The last 365 days have been very tough on coach. I shed a lot of tears. My wife and dog left me. I woke up one morning naked in a chicken coop. And I might have killed a man. [clears throat] Uh, but that is all in the past, because tomorrow night, we get our first shot at redemption. Yes! [all cheering] The reign of the Bulldogs is over! This is the year of the Hawks! [all cheering] I would like to hand the stage over to the captain of our team and the man who is gonna lead us all the way to the Connecticut Cup, Kyle Moore! - [all cheering] - [marching band playing] Wow, thanks. Thanks so much. It's been a fast and furious ride ever since I got here. Don't you mean fast and fraudulent ride? [feedback blares] He's got you all believing he's a singer, and a hockey player and worst of all... a heterosexual. But he's none of these things. Not without his magic app! What? He's got a magic app on his phone that allows him to be whoever and whatever he wants. This boy you all worship is a lie. - You're an idiot! Boo! - [all booing] It's the truth! I'm telling you! Did you hear me? It's a magic app. - On his phone! - All right, come on, let's go, buddy. - He's a nobody! He's a nobody! - [microphone feedback] Wait, wait! Hold on. I gotta be honest about some things. It's true, four or five weeks ago, I'd never played a game of hockey in my life. I never ice skated. I've never even held a stick. He's like the Roy Hobbs of hockey. No, listen to me. I don't deserve any of this attention. I'm... An incredibly modest superstar! No! I'm trying to tell you! I'm a fake, a phoney! I don't even know who I am! - A role model to everyone here tonight. - Exactly! Unless we lose to the Bulldogs, and then he's dead to every one of us. Let's light this fire! [all cheering] Kyle? Dani! Dani, wait, please. What do you want from me, Kyle? You have everything. You have the fame, the glory. You even have the girl. - What more could you possibly want? - I don't want any of it. This, these clothes, this isn't me. You know that. If I could take it all back right now, if I could erase everything, I would. - Okay, then why don't you? - Because I can't. You can't? Look... everything Brian said was true. There's this app and everything I wish for comes true. And I wished that I could sing, so I could get close to you and then it happened, and then, so did everything else. And I wanna take it all back, Dani, but there's nothing I can do. Let me just get this straight. You've been a jerk because of an app? - I know it sounds crazy. - You know what's even crazier? I wrote "Drowning" the day after you took me on the Ferris wheel. Hey, can I have your autograph? Look, it's been a really long... - [groans] - Whoo! Turn down for what? [grunts] [soft music playing] [knock on door] - You ready to get up? - I'm not going to school today. What now? I just don't want to go. Well, that's not really a reason. You have to convince me to let you stay home. What is it? What's going on with you? I posted some things on social media, and I've hurt people. And it all keeps getting worse, and I've really messed up. Okay, well, when you mess up, and you're gonna mess up, the only thing you can do is take ownership of it and try to make it right, that's it. It's like ripping off a Band-Aid. It's gonna hurt, but just do it and it's done. And look, social media, that stuff isn't real, you know that. It's just everybody's highlight reel of the stuff they want you to see. It's all bullshit. It's bullshit with a filter on it, to make it look pretty. Let's eat. Get up. Hey, Mom... you look really pretty today. Thank you, but you still have to go to school. Ugh, good morning, family, huh? - What's for breakfast? I'm starving. - [Ann] French toast. French toast, sounds good. Hey, you know what? We should go down to the park and do some skating today, that's what we should do. Well, how's that job going, Dad? Wow, right out of the gates, huh? Just... [explosion sound] Well, if you gotta know, um, that one didn't pan out. I gotta lot of good leads, though, so don't sweat it. More importantly, do we got any powdered sugar to go with that French toast? Only Annie knows the answer. Annie, talk to me! - Powdered sugar! - Wait, Mom, sit down. [snickers] You okay, killer? You're acting a little weird. I'm fine. But Mom's not getting your breakfast today or any other day. The free ride stops right now. What are you talking about? What's going on? Did I miss something? - Did you say something? - Darryl. - You said something. He's all worked up. - Leave her out of this. - This is about me and you. - Is it? - Yeah. - All right. Well, what is it about you and me? When Mom moved me away from you... I was so angry... and hurt, and alone. She took me away from my best friend, my hero. I would have done anything for you to come back in my life but the truth is... you didn't even want me. You didn't even want me. I was so wrong, and I made Mom go through hell because of it. But Mom, Maxi and I, we deserve somebody who wants to be with us, and you deserve to live your life. As hard as that is... I get it now. Maxi? You feel the same way? Grampa, I know how you feel. All right. I guess you're the man of the house. Congratulations. I'm gonna go get my breakfast elsewhere. - Xing-fu, hey. - Hey. [in Mandarin] Xing-fu. Hey, Kyle. I'm sorry for being such a lousy, little sister. - I could do a lot worse. - [chuckles] [knock on door] - Hi, Mr Gregory? - Yes? I'm Kyle Moore, I just wanted to drop by and say hello. I'm Lonnie's friend. Good God in Heaven, you're real. Honey! Honey! Come quick! What is it? This is Kyle, Lonnie's friend. Did he put you up to this? Is he paying you? No, Lonnie's really my friend. To be honest, he's actually my best friend. [chuckles] Hey, Lonnie. I gotta go, but it was great meeting you guys. - The pleasure's ours. - Come back again. Soon! Please! Lonnie! - Wait up, man! - Leave me alone, Kyle. Hey, don't push off with your front foot, that's mongo. Don't tell me what to do. Hey, so get this, I met this guy in Cleveland, says he's a bikini model named Phil. You're lucky you're my only friend. I'm back, buddy. [all laughing] Kyle? Kyle! What are you doing? If it isn't the Prince of popularity. What are you doing over here with us lepers? You don't look so good, bud. Well, let's see, I lost my girl, I lost my scholarships. Coach demoted me to fourth line. My friends want nothing to do with me and now my dad's talking about sending me to military school. So yeah, life's great. I'm doing fantastic. - You got something on your face. - I don't care. What is Kyle doing with that loser? - So gross. - I can't believe I dated him. Ugh! I can't believe I slept... Um, through third period. LOL. Come on, Derek, where's that clean cut, confident guy that I hated a few months ago? He's you now. I gotta go. Wait, wait, wait. Look, man, this isn't me. I don't want to be this guy. I want to help you get on top again. I don't know what your game is, all right? But if you're looking to bury me some more, give it your best shot. There's no angle here. I just want to make things right. [music playing] [Dani singing] ♪ I thought you'd be mine And it felt so good ♪ ♪ One look in your eyes And I swear I knew ♪ ♪ Love, your kiss, your touch... ♪ [whistles] Hold on, everybody. Hold on, thank you. Dani, what's the matter, honey? Talk to me. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, it's the song, it was written as a duet. I don't think I can sing it. It's beautiful and you sing it so well. It just doesn't feel right any more. Is there any way we could go back to "Hallelujah"... please? Oh, my God, these girls with their boy problems. [groans] Okay, everybody, "Hallelujah", from the top. [Mr Moody] All right, you remember how that goes. Horns, you want to get your spittle out now so we don't have to watch that later? Here we go. Whoa! Charlotte, hey, didn't see you stalking... standing there. Hmm. Have you been ignoring me? No, why would I be ignoring you? No, I've just... You've been ignoring my texts, you've been ignoring me at lunch. You ignored me at the bonfire. I will not be ignored, Kyle. - Shh! - Shut up! I will eat your children! Okay. [door closes] I don't want to fight you. I just want to love you. Mmm. [snickers] I love you so much. We're gonna be together forever. Good luck at the game tonight. I'll be watching every little step. Oh, my God. [cheering] [chanting] Let's go Hawks! Let's go Hawks! [Kyle] So, that's the end of my story. Where it goes from here, only the universe knows. This my life now. I have to live it. But, I'm gonna live it my way. [announcer on PA] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome your very own, number 17, Kyle Moore! How many goals you got in you tonight, superstar? - More than they do. - [laughs] That's my boy! Go out there and take the face-off! Come on, now. That's my boy, Kyle. You are my boy! All right now, let's play as a team! Okay. Yeah, boys, let's go, boys! [coach] Let's win this face-off, let's go! Hey, Moore, I got your number tonight. I'm gonna light you up.
