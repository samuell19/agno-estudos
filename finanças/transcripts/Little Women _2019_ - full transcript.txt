Excuse me. I was looking for the Weekly Volcano office. I wished to see Mr. Dashwood? A friend of mine desired me to offer a story, by her. She wrote it, she'd be glad to write more if this suits. Not a first attempt, I take it? No, sir, she has sold to "Olympic" and "Scandal." And she got a prize for a tale at the "Blarney Stone Banner." A prize? Yes. Sit. We'll take this. You will? With alterations. It's too long. But, you've cut... I took care to have a few of my sinners repent. The country just went through a war. People want to be amused, not preached at. Morals don't sell nowadays. Perhaps mention that to your "friend." What compensation-- How do you..? We pay 25 to 30 for things of this sort. We'll pay 20 for that. You can have it. Make the edits. Should I tell my, my friend that you'll take another if she had one better than this? We'll look at it. Tell her to make it short and spicy. And if the main character is a girl, make sure she's married by the end. Or dead, either way. Excuse me? What name would she like put to the story? Yes - none at all, if you please. Just as she likes, of course. Good morning, sir. Good day. My Beth would like you very much. This is a boarding house, not a charity, I need the rent on time! Good afternoon, Miss March. Good afternoon. You're on fire. Thank you. You're on fire! Thank you. I have the same habit, you see? Kitty and Minny are waiting! My students need me. Always working. Money is the end and aim of my mercenary existence. No one gets ink stains like yours just out of a desire for money. Well, my sister Amy is in Paris, and until she marries someone obscenely wealthy, it's up to me to keep the family afloat. Goodbye. The decadents have ruined Paris, if you ask me. These French women couldn't lift a hairbrush. Amy! I said, "These French women couldn't lift a hairbrush." Oh yes! Very true, Aunt March. Don't humor me, girl. What did they write, your troublemaking family? Mother doesn't say anything about Beth. I feel I should go back, but they all say "stay." You can do nothing if you go back. The girl is sick, not lonely. And you shouldn't go home until you and Fred Vaughn are properly engaged. Yes, and until I've completed all of my painting lessons, of course. Oh, yes, yes. Of course. Stop the carriage! Laurie! Laurie! Amy! My, you've grown so much! You wrote you'd meet me at the hotel. - I couldn't find you anywhere-- - You didn't look hard enough! Or maybe I didn't recognize you because you're so beautiful now. - Oh, stop it. - I thought you liked that sort of thing. No, where's your Grandfather? He's in Germany. He's still traveling. I'm traveling on my own now-- And flirting and gambling and drinking-- Don't tell your mother. Are you chasing some young girl across Europe? No. I couldn't believe Jo turned you down. I'm so sorry. Don't be, Amy. I'm not. Amy! Amy March! You come back here right this instance! Come. Come on. Get him off me! Allons-y. I'm meaning to be somewhere. Laurie, come to the New Year's Party! It's a ball and everyone will be there, including Fred. Pick me up at the hotel at eight - the Chavain! Laurie, dress for festivities! Top hats and silks! I will! I'll wear my best silk. It's Laurie! I know. Twenty yards of the blue silk as well as the pink. Someone will be by for it later. Meg! That would look so lovely on you. I know just the dressmaker to send you to. You'll be the prettiest wife in Concord. John needs a new coat for winter, and Daisy and Demi need new clothes-- And his wife needs a new dress. I can't... it's... I just can't. He'll be so pleased with how you look, he'll forget all about the expense. I don't suppose that's too much an extravagance. Will 20 yards do? Yes. Very good. Fifty dollars, what was I thinking? Mommy -- mommy! My loves. Go play. Beth? Beth? There lies your way, due west. Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship! You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me? Stay! I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me. That you do think you are not what you are. If I think so, I think the same of you. Then think you right: I am not what I am. Excuse me? I only speak English. I'm sorry. What? What did you say? Come dance. I know exactly who I want to dance with. Who will you dance with, Jo? You know I never dance. Why can't we all go to the party?! It's not fair! - Just wear your regular shoes. - These fit last winter. My nose will simply not look refined. I like your nose. Now, Jo-- Don't touch me, thanks! I already feel ridiculous. I don't want to look-- - You could be pretty if you tried. - Don't want to, won't do it. I don't want to go but I wish I could hear all the music. I'll keep it all in my head and try to sing it for you. Ought they to smoke like that? It's the dampness drying. What a queer smell, it's like burnt feathers. I'll take this off and you'll see a perfect ringlet. Why is her hair off? - Meg, I'm so sorry. - What have you done?! I'm sorry! You shouldn't have asked me to do it! Marmee! I can't go! I'm spoilt! My hair! Don't stare, don't put your hands behind your back, don't say Christopher Columbus, don't say Capital, don't shake hands, don't whistle. Meg March! You look so pretty! Meg... Sorry, I didn't know anyone was here. Not at all, stay, if you like. I won't disturb you? No, I don't know many people here, I felt rather strange at first. So do I. Miss March, isn't it? Yes, Mr. Laurence, but I'm not Miss March, I'm only Jo. And I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie. Don't you dance? I don't know how you do things here yet, I've spent most of my life in Europe. Europe! That's Capital! I shouldn't use words like that. Says who? Meg. She's my older sister. Here. That's her, see? The girl in the violet dress? It's very pretty. She reminds me to be good, so Father will be proud of me when he returns. Where is he? Volunteered for the Union Army. And I wanted to go fight with him. I can't get over my disappointment in being a girl. Jo, would you like to dance with me? I can't, because... Because of what? You won't tell? Never. I scorched my dress, see? There. And Meg told me to keep still, so no one would see it. You can laugh if you want to. It's funny, I know. I have an idea of how we can manage. My foot - I've hurt my ankle. How am I going to get home? I don't see what you can do except get a carriage - or stay here all night. - Carriages are too expensive. Let me take you. It's right next door. No, thank you, we cannot accept. You must take mine. Please. No, it's so early, you can't mean to leave yet. I always leave early - I do, truly. What choice do you have? I told you those shoes were too small. Goodness gracious, what have you done! - You're back! How was it? - Clear that chair. All right, help your sister, then back to bed! Make room, Meg is a wounded soldier! I sprained my ankle. Oh, Meg - you'll kill yourself for fashion one of these days. Hannah! We need ice! - Come in. Come in. - It's all right. Apologies for the chaos: I enjoy baking in the middle of the night. And don't mind the clutter, Mr. Laurence, we don't. Laurie, please. Can I call you Teddy? Yes. You must be part of their theatricals! They could use-- I'm Amy. Hello. - Have a scone. - This? Thank you. Laurie, how are your ankles? Do you need ice? No, thank you, ma'am. Just call me Mother, or Marmee. Everyone does. Meg, why didn't you wear those pink shoes-- It's cold! But they look so good! It feels like being a fine young lady to come home from my party in a carriage and have maids wait on me. For the writer in the attic: Because you enjoyed the play so much tonight, I wanted you to have this. It will help you study character and paint it with your pen. I would love to read what you're writing, if you'll trust me. I promise honesty and whatever intelligence I can muster. Yours, Friedrich. Fred, would you like a glass? I will, thank you. Would you excuse me for one second? Laurie. Amy. I waited an hour for you. I feel caught. Amy, please! Amy. Do you want to know what I honestly think of you? What do you honestly think of me? - I despise you. - Why do you despise me? Because with every chance of being good, happy and useful you are lazy, faulty and miserable. Oh, this is interesting. Selfish people do like to talk about themselves. - Am I selfish? - Yes, very selfish. With your money, talent, beauty, and health. Oh, you think I'm beautiful? You like that, you old vanity - with all these good things to enjoy, you can find nothing to do but dawdle. I'll be good for you, Saint Amy, I'll be good! Aren't you ashamed of a hand like that? No, I'm not. Looks like it's never done a day of work in its life, and that ring is ridiculous. Jo gave me this ring. I feel sorry for you, I really do. I just wish you'd bear it better. You don't have to feel sorry for me, Amy. You'll feel the same way one day. No, I'd be respected if I couldn't be loved. What have you done lately, oh great "artiste"? Perhaps, you're fantasizing about spending Fred Vaughn's fortune? Fred Vaughn, ladies and gentlemen! Fred, I'm so sorry. Those are just stories, of course. But I'm working on a novel. And your novel, it will be like this? Yes... so far, anyway. With plots like this? Duels and killing? It sells, so... Why don't you sign your real name? My mother wouldn't like it. It's too gory for her. I want to help with the money I make, and not worry her. You know, I don't like them. Honestly, I mean... I think that they're not good. But... They're published in the papers, and people have always said that I'm talented. Oh, I think you're talented, which is why I'm being so blunt. I can't afford to starve on praise. Are you upset? Of course, I'm upset! You just told me you didn't like my work! I thought you wanted honesty. Yes, I do! Has no one ever talked to you like this before? Yes, I've been rejected plenty of times. Do you have anyone to take you seriously, Jo, to talk about your work? And who made you High Priest of what's good and what's bad? - No one, and I'm not. - Then why are you acting like it? Jo, your reaction indicates that-- My reaction indicates that you are a pompous blowhard! Shakespeare wrote for the masses. Shakespeare was the greatest poet who ever lived, because smuggled his poetry in popular works. - But, I'm no Shakespeare. - Thank goodness, we already have him. If you know so much about it, then why don't you do it yourself? Because I'm not a writer. I don't have the gifts you have. No, you don't! And you will always be a critic, and never an author, and the world will forget that you've ever even lived. I'm sure they will. But I... No one will forget Jo March. I can believe it. Listen, we are not friends, you are not my friend. And I don't want your opinion because I don't like you very much, so, just don't talk to me anymore, thank you. Josephine, this came for you. Thank you. Jo, came home immediately, Beth has taken a turn for the worse. Mother. Beth. Merry Christmas, world. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Jo, we've been up for hours. - What have you been writing? I got carried away with our delicious revenge play last night. Poison. No, no poison, It's Christmas! Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents. It's so dreadful being poor. How come some girls get to have lots of pretty things and others have nothing at all. At least we have father and mother, and each other. We haven't got father. And we won't have him for as long as this war drags on. I wish I had heaps of money and plenty of servants, so I never had to work again. You could be a proper actress on the boards. - They aren't all fallen women. - I can't be an actress. I have lots of wishes, but my favorite one is to be an artist in Paris, and do fine pictures, and to be the best painter in the world. That's what you want too, isn't it Jo? To be a famous writer? Yes, but it sounds so crass when she says it. - Why be ashamed of what you want? - I'm not. My wish is to have us all to be together with Father and Mother in this house. - That's what I want. - Beth is perfect. What about your music, Queen Bess? I only do that for us, I don't need anyone else to hear it. You must not limit yourself. Mother proposed not having any Christmas presents this year because our men are suffering in the army. We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices and do it gladly. Don't play mother just because she's not home. - Jo, that's so boyish. - That's why I do it. - I detest rude, unladylike-like girls. - I hate affected little chits. My nose! My nose! It's already no good! I know you don't care what I think, but you don't want your mother to find you like this, do you? Of course, we care what you think, Hannah. You're more family than wicked old Aunt March. - Don't, Jo. - Where is Marmee? Goodness only knows. Some poor creature came a-beggin', your ma set straight off to see what was needed. I wish she could help other people at a time convenient to us. - Joanna and I are very hungry. - Dolls don't get hungry, Beth. I've re-written the climax, and we need to set it to memory. Amy, you get the costumes. I have made the most divine crown, and I painted my old shoes blue, so she looks like a princess. I think the melancholy piece I've figured out is pretty good. Meg, wait until you see this new speech. I don't see how you can write such splendid things, Jo. - You're a regular Shakespeare. - Not quite. Miss Michelangelo, can you please rehearse the fainting scene? You're as stiff as a poker in that. I can't help it. I never saw anyone faint before, and I don't intend to make myself all black and blue. If I can fall down easily, I'll try. And If I cannot, I shall fall gracefully into a chair, and I don't care if Hugo comes at me with a pistol. - Hannah... - I'm not acting. I didn't even say anything! I knew what you were going to say and I'm not acting. Merry Christmas, girls! Marmee! Merry Christmas! I'm so glad to see you so happy. Jo, you look tired - were you up again all night writing? Of course. Amy, come kiss me! Merry Christmas. How are my girls? - I'm so hungry! - Look at this breakfast! - I could eat a horse. - Don't say that, Jo! I can't believe this is our Christmas. What? What is it? Not far from here lives a poor young woman, Mrs. Hummel. Her five children are in one bed to keep from freezing, and there is nothing to eat. My girls, will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present? Is this where you say that Father would want us to? Yes. Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Laurence, for including me. You're welcome. Perhaps you could tutor my grandson in manners as well as mathematics. Ach, mein Gott! It is good angels come to us! I'm back! I have food and blankets and sweaters. And we brought some medicine. These are my girls. Say hello. He's not well. Girls, why don't you unpack the food... Would you like some of these? You want one? It's good, isn't it? Is it fairies? - Santa Claus. - No, it's old Aunt March. Mr. Laurence sent it. The Laurence boy's grandfather? - Yes. - Why? He saw you giving your Christmas breakfast away, and he wanted you to enjoy the day. But I thought he was a mean old man. That's so generous of him. His grandson Laurie put the idea into his head. I know he did. We should make friends with him. Boys scare me. And that big old house scares me. Jenny Snow says that Mr. Laurence disowned his son after he went off with an Italian woman, and now his grandson is an orphan, and he spends all of his time in that house locked up with his tutor. He's a very kind man who lost his little girl when she was only a child, and now his son as well. His daughter died? That's so sad. But doesn't Laurie just seem so romantic? He's half Italian. What do you know? You've barely ever spoken to him. I am not responsible for this feast, but I have got a surprise. Is he coming home, our Father? Don't I wish I could go... Poor Jo - we can't give up our only brother. It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent. Jo sits in the back, so we can't see her cry. - So what if I do? - When will he be coming home? He'll stay and work faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask for him to come back a minute sooner than he can be spared. "Give them all my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their affection at all times. A year seems a very long time to wait before I see them, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so these hard days need not be wasted. I know they will be loving children to you, do their duty faithfully, fight their enemies bravely, and conquer themselves so beautifully... 'The Witch's Curse' - a play by Jo March. Maketh sweet and swift and strong... ...and when I come back to them I may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women." Brava! Excuse me. Excuse me. Your stop, ma'am. Thank you. She's gone? Why? I don't know. She just left. But she didn't say if she was coming back? We didn't have a heart to heart, Professor. Why are you just sitting there? Please go, go! Dust something. And what about the girls? She was the best teacher they ever had. I know. It is so hard to go back to work after such good times. I wish it was Christmas every day. Or New Year's, wouldn't that be exciting? We are a bunch of ungrateful minxes. Don't say such despicable thing! I like good strong words that mean something. I have to go back to school and I don't have any limes. All the girls were trading pickled limes, and I'm in debt. I owe every so many limes. - Will this do? - What did you do that for? Meg, thank you! I know what it is to want little things and feel less than other girls. Between that and the drawings that would wipe out my debt. - What drawings? - Nothing. I'm just glad that mother doesn't make me go to school with all those girls... Hurry! I'll be late! Beth, after your shopping, I need you to work your way through the new sums and spelling and I'll check it all when I get home. - Fine. - Bye. - Josephine. - Yes? - Josephine. - Yes, here. Is there a reason you stopped reading Belsham? I'm sorry, I'll continue. You mind yourself, dearie, some day you'll need me and you'll wish you had behaved better. Thank you, Aunt March, for your employment and your many kindnesses, but I intend to make my own way in the world. No one makes their own way, not really, least of all a woman. You'll need to marry well. But you are not married, Aunt March. That's because I'm rich. And I made sure to keep all of my money, unlike your Father. So, the only way to be an unmarried woman is to be rich? Yes. But there are precious few ways for women to make money. That's not true. You could run a cat house, or go on the stage. Practically the same thing. Other than that, you're right, precious few ways for women. That's why you should heed me. So I can get married? No, so you can live a better life than your poor mother has. Marmee loves her life. You don't know what she loves. Your father cared more about educating freedmen's children than he did about caring for his own family. Yes, but he was right. It's possible to be right and foolish. Well, I don't think so. Well, you're not paid to think. I know you don't care much about marriage now. I can't say I blame you. But I intend to go to Europe one more time, and I need a companion. How would you like to be the person I take? I'd like that more than anything. All right, then read. And don't sneak around. I don't like sneaks. President Lincoln. No! Father is fighting for him. My father says the war is a waste, and we should just let them keep their labor. Susan, it is immoral. Everyone benefited from the system, including you Marches. Why should only the south be punished? - We should all be punished. - The Marches love a cause. Fine, just do Mr. Davis. I don't know if I should. I'll wipe your debt and give you five more limes besides. Miss March. Sit down. Sit down, Laurie. Latin is a privilege. Please, you have to learn this. I can't afford to lose this position. Just return to the Cicero. There's a girl out there. - No, there is not. - Yes, Mr. Brooke, there is a girl! No, there is not. - Oh, there is a girl! - That's a girl. Hello there! Are you hurt? I'm Amy. Hello Amy, I'm Laurie. I know, you brought my sister back after the dance. I would've never sprained my ankle, I have lovely small feet. The best in the family. But I can never go home again, because I'm in such trouble. Look. Mr. Davis hit me. Tell the servants I want this painting purchased for me! Immediately! Amy, are you in here? Meg! My hand. Look. - Jo. - What richness! It hurts so much. Theodore Lawrence you ought to be the happiest boy in the world! A fellow can't live on books alone. I could. Would did you do? Nothing. I did nothing. I did a drawing and then Mr. Davis hit me. Christopher Columbus, look at that. That's my grandfather. Are you scared of him? No, I'm not scared of anyone! He looks stern, but my grandfather was much more handsome. Jo! We do not compare grandfathers. You think he's more handsome, hey? No, actually, you are very handsome. I didn't mean-- I knew your mother's father. You've got his spirit. Oh, well... Thank you, sir. You are not to attend that school anymore. Good, that man has always been an idiot. - Jo will teach you. - Me? I already teach Beth! You're a good teacher. Yes, women being taught at home is much more proper, I believe. Only because the schools for women are so poor. Indeed, quite right. I wish all the girls would leave his horrible school and that he would die. Amy, you did wrong, and there will be consequences. I didn't! I didn't even do anything! I just did a drawing! Thank you so much for taking care of our Amy. Yes, of course. My girls have a way of getting into mischief. So do I. Then, you'll run over and we'll take care of you. Please, and come over whenever you'd like. Invite you sister Beth as well. Yes! Beth would adore the piano! Is she the quiet one? - Yes. - That's our Beth. Tell the little girl to use our piano. And Jo, borrow whatever book you'd like. - Can I come look at the paintings? - Yes. There is also a lovely greenhouse. We must go, girls. I'm going to take this. I'm gonna take this one, if that's okay. I'll bring it back soon, I promise. - Thank you for my hand! - Thank you, bye. Oh, Miss Meg! You forgot your glove! Back to work. Back to work. Order! Order! Order! A new play, written by Miss Jo March, will appear at the Barnville Theatre, in the course of the next few weeks, that will surpass anything ever seen before on the American stage. Starring the greatest actress from here to the Mississippi River, Miss Meg March. Weekly report: Meg - good, Jo - bad, Beth - very good, and Amy - sort of middling. Mr. President and gentlemen, I wish to propose the admission of a new member. One, who would be deeply deeply grateful, and would add immensely to the spirit of the club. I propose Mr. Theodore Laurence! - Absolutely not! - No! What? Come now, let's have him. He's a real boy! We don't want any boys. This is a club for ladies. I think we should to do it, even if we are afraid. I say yes. It's Laurie! - No! - It will change everything! All right. I call a vote. - Put your hands up. Aye! Aye! - Don't put your hand up! Put your hand up. It's Laurie. Fine! Aye! And, as there is no time like present. Ladies, please - this is my stratagem, I deserve the blame: Jo only gave into it after lots of teasing. Yes. I merely wish to say, as a slight token of my gratitude and as a means of promoting friendly relations between adjoining nations, And thus I propose this set of keys for a little post office I've made in the forest by the pond. Yes. Four keys, for you darling. ...and for you. Thank you. Thank you very much. And this is for me. Without further ado Thank you for your favor, I will take my seat as a part of the club. Hello! Daisy and Demi! You've gotten so big! I wish you were here to teach them... I know. I'm here now. So good to have you home. I think the loneliness got to Beth, though she ain't said anything. Where is Beth? She's upstairs. Oh, my Jo. We all thought she was better, but the fever had weakened her heart. Take this and find her the best doctor you can. No, you need this money to live in New York. I'm not going back. I'm using the rest to take her to the sea and get her strong. When's Amy coming home? We didn't want to worry her. Does she not know? Beth insisted we not tell her because she didn't want to ruin Amy's trip. Amy has always had a talent for getting out of the hard parts of life. Jo, don't be angry with your sister. Jo! Jo, where are you? - I can't find my other glove. - Take mine. Jo we're going to be late! - Where are you going? - You're not invited. You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know it! Yes, we are, now stop bothering. - Do you have the tickets? - Yes! Hurry up! You're going to the theatre with Laurie. Meg, please, can I come? I'm sorry, dear, but you weren't invited. You can't go Amy, so don't be a baby and whine about it. I've been shut up in here and I never get to go anywhere. Beth has her piano, and I'm so lonely! I can teach you chords. I don't want chords, Beth I want to go-- No. I think you'd hate to poke yourself in where you're not wanted. We already have to deal with dull Mr. Brooke. I like him, he's kind. - I can pay for myself. - You will not come! I'm sorry, my sweet, but Jo is right. Next time. Come, Meg, stop petting her. Please! Please! You'll be sorry for this Jo March! You will! You'll regret this! Stop looking at me like that! Jo! Meg, you're a million times better than she was. Although she was a terrific fainter. I wonder how she managed to turn so white as she did. That Mr. Brooke, could he be any more obsequious? I thought he was very well-mannered. Hold on, let me just get this idea down. Beth, what's your favorite eye color? Purple. Mr. Brooke has blue eyes and an old soul, which is much more important than money. Has anyone taken my novel? - No. - No, why? Amy, you've got it. No, I haven't. - That's a lie. - No, it isn't. I haven't got it, I don't know where it is and I don't care. Tell me or I'll make you! I burnt your book! I told you I'll make you pay, and I did! Jo! Jo! I'm sorry, Jo. Amy. It's just that the only thing you care about is your writing. And it's not as if I could've hurt you by ruining one of your dresses. And I really did want to hurt you. I am the most sorry for it now. I'm so sorry. Jo. Don't let the sun go down on your anger. Forgive her. Help each other. And you begin again tomorrow. She doesn't deserve my forgiveness. And I will hate her! I will hate her forever! Good morning ladies! Brisk and brilliant outside today, last day at the river - get your ice skates! Jo, you promised me I could come last time, Jo! Is she going to be like this forever? It was a very hard loss for her. Is there nothing I can do? Go after her. Don't say anything till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie, and then just say some kind thing, I'm sure she'll be friends again. Jo! Wait! I'm coming! You said I could come last time. Jo! Wait! Wait! I'm coming! Wait! Jo! Stay near the edge, it's not safe in the middle. Got it. Jo! Jo, I'm coming! Jo! Jo, let's go. Jo, wait! Jo! Are you all right? Yes. Help! Help me! Amy! It's Amy! Jo! Jo! Jo, get a branch! Get a branch! Amy! Amy! Please help me! Jo, help me pull. Amy, grab the branch! Grab it, Amy! I'm so sorry! Oh, my sister! Oh, my sister! She's asleep. If she had died it would've been my fault. She'll be fine. The doctor said he didn't even think she'd catch cold. What is wrong with me? I've made so many resolutions, and written sad notes, and I've cried over my sins, but it just doesn't seem to help. When I get in a passion I get so savage, I could hurt anyone and I'd enjoy it. You remind me of myself. But you're never angry. I'm angry nearly every day of my life. You are? I'm not patient by nature, but with nearly 40 years of effort I'm learning to not let it get the better of me. I'll do the same, then. I hope you'll do a great deal better than me. There are some natures too noble to curb, and too lofty to bend. Jo. Oh, Beth! My love! You didn't need to come. I never should've left. Do you need anything? Take some water. It's so good to see your face. We're going to the sea to get you strong and well. The sea? I want you dancing by the time Amy gets back. She's not cutting her trip short, is she? - No. No. - Good. Is there any news? What does she say? She writes that Laurie is there. I'm glad he's with her. He won't respond to any of my letters. Do you miss him? I miss everything. I know. Hurry up, you two. Meg is going to be gone for a week. We're coming. You take the other carriage, Laurie, and spy on Meg, make sure she doesn't fall in love. I will. It was so nice of Annie to invite me to her debutante ball. Thank you for letting me go, Marmee. Just be who you are, And wear this to the ball, it was mine when I was your age. I've never understood saving jewelry until marriage. You should have something that's just yours. Pretty things should be enjoyed. Yes, pretty things should be enjoyed. I wish I could go to the debutante ball. Do you think this is a good idea, her going away like this? Girls have to go into the world and make up their own minds about things. Don't forget about us. I won't Jo, it's only a week. - It's beautiful. - It's not yours. It would look very good on me. She needs to have some decent shoes. Thank you for the carriage, Mr. Laurence. I don't know how to repay you. Nonsense. Nonsense. Although there is one thing. It occurred to me today that my daughter's piano suffers from want of use. Any of your girls like to run over, and practice on it now and then, just to keep it in tune? If they don't care to come, then never mind. Oh, sir, they do care, very very much. You are the musical girl? I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite sure nobody will hear me, and be disturbed. Not a soul, my dear. - I'll miss you. - Bye. Bye. Enjoy the ball. I'll be back soon. Don't go and get married, Meg! Don't go falling in love! - Unless right now. - I love you. Right this second. Thank you. I'd be so excited about tonight. Now what dress will you wear tonight, Meg? - I will wear this one. - That one? Can't you send home for another? I haven't got another. Only the one? Oh, that's so funny. Not at all. There's no need in sending home, Daisy. I'm going to call you Daisy now. I've got a sweet pink dress laid away, and you'll wear it to please me, won't you, Daisy? If it's all right. Of course! Everyone's in love with you, Daisy. You have to keep my dress. I can't keep your dress. You have to, please. Have fun, little Daisy. Laurie. I didn't know you were going to come. It was supposed to be a surprise. And what a lovely surprise it is. Why are they calling you "Daisy"? It's their pet name for me. Meg is a perfectly good name. It's just like playing a part, to be Daisy for a little
