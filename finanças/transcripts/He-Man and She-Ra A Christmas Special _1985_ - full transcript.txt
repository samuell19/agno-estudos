It's a happy time for us, dear Marlena. Just think: this will be the first time the twins are together to celebrate their birthday with all our family! Adora's friends even came from far off Etheria. And they're all helping to decorate! Oh, Perfuma, thank you! They're beautiful! A little higher, Flutterina! How's this? I think purple would look good up there, Peekablue. Try it! What a celebration! The preparations have been going on for days. You know, it reminds me of how we used to get ready for Christmas at this time of year. Christmas? What's that? An Earth holiday? A very special Earth holiday. I wonder where Adam and Man-at-Arms are? Shouldn't we be helping with the decorations? In a minute. We're almost finished here. You know, if it works, this little Sky-Spy will give us a complete picture of Skeletor's every move. Hmm...interesting! I think I'll take a look! Uhhh, but... How do I get inside? Aha! Vroom! Vroom! Alright, Adam, I think we're in good shape for tomorrow's flight. All systems on! Uh-oh... What happened? What did I do? Switch off the rockets! I can't! The controls won't work! Something tells me I'm in BIG trouble! That ship - what is it? That's... that's a meteor! A meteor! You better have your eyes checked, you lame-brain! Yeah, watch it, motor-mouth! Enough, Two-Bad! Get that ship before it escapes or I'll put both your heads in orbit! Left it is, Sir! To the right! Yes, Sir, Skeletor! - Left! - Right! Oh, no! It's the Colector! And it's chasing me! What's happening? The Sky-Spy suddenly took of by itself! Look! Skeletor's going after the Sky-Spy! Then He-Man's going after Skeletor! By the power of Grayskull! I HAVE THE POWER! I've got a feeling my brother may need some help. Get it! Scoop it up! You're trying to grab more than you can handle! Yeah... I've almost got it! You've almost got it!? I almost got it! Oh, no! You know what? These claws need a manicure. Fools! What is it? What happened? Ma... Ma... Master! It's... it's... He-Man! Quiet! He'll hear us! There we are! Claws to paws! Use the force belt! Don't let him get away with it! - Yes, Master! - No. Master! A force belt, huh? Uh, oh! There are too many of these things! Looks like you need a hand, brother! Sis! Just in time! As usual! Let's get a little fresh air in here! Ready? One... two... THREE! How can I get this thing down? Or should I try a spell? Why not! Sky-Spy, Sky-Spy, skipidy-skate, get me down to someplace safe! Oh, no! Now what did I do? The Sky-Spy! It's spinning off into space! They're getting away! What are you doing, Rattlor? He-Man ruined our controles! The automatic pilot is taking us back to Snake Mountain. What?! Then take this! I don't need a parachute. That's what you think! I'm affraid we've lost your Sky-Spy. Well, it's a good thing nobody's in it. I never should have gotten into this thing! And nobody even knows I'm here! I can't understand how the ship just took off by itself. Maybe this Finder beam can locate it? Phew, it's slowing down. Boy, am I glad! Back home again! Hey! That doesn't look like Eternia... Oh... we... we... we're going in! Shoo! That was close! I guess I should have fastened my seat belt. Oh! Brrrrr! Where am I? This place is fre...freezing! Help! Help! Somebody's in trouble! I'd better take a look! Miguel! Oh my gosh! They'll be buried by an avalanche! Which spell can I use? Oh! Little children, up and away! Play in the snow another day! Please, work! What's happening to us? Hey! Put us down! No, no! Don't say that! No, too late! You broke the spell! And what are you doing out here alone in the snow, anyway? Getting the Christmas tree. A what? A christmas tree. Until we got lost. Ah, there, there. You're not really lost. You found me, didn't you? Found you? Yeah! I'm the one who's lost! My ship crashed just over that hill. Come on, I'll show you and maybe we can find a way to get you safely home to your parents! I'll have the Finder activated in just a... Duncan! Adam! We've got a serious problem! What is it? It's Orko! He's missing! Missing? Yes, and we just found his magic book outside. Where? Near the launch pad! The launch pad! Uh-oh! He must have stowed away in the Sky-Spy! Yes! And accidently switched on the rockets! We've got to find him! What's that? It's a flying saucer! Nah, it is a Sky-Spy. C'mon, let's go inside and warm up. You said you were looking for a "Prismas" tree? What's that? First of all, it's a Prismas... No! I mean it's not a Prismas tree, it's a Christmas tree! And it's to celebrate Christmas. Oh... What's Christmas? - Everybody knows what Christmas is! - I don't! - When you get lots of presents! Presents! Hey, I think I like Christmas! Well, presents are part of it... But it's also a time when everybody thinks about peace and good will toward men. That's what the Angel said! Angel? Now I'm really getting confused! No, it's not confusing! Not at all! Listen, if you really don't know about Christmas, we'll tell you the whole story... A long, long time ago... I've got it! Here's where the Sky-Spy landed! Why, those are Earth coordinates! Orko's landed on Earth! Are you saying that we'll never get Orko back? No, Teela! My transport beam might do it. The problem is, it needs a Carium water crystal to power it and there are none here on Eternia. But maybe on Etheria... It's possible. Well, if it's in the water, Mermista would know about it. Well, can you have She-Ra contact her? I think that can be arranged... ...and the Three Wise Men followed the Star until they finally reached Bethlehem. Ah, what a beautiful story! But what about the gifts? You said there were gifts at Christmas! That's the fun part! Let's tell him about Santa Claus! I'll tell him! Are you sure you don't want me to come along, sis? No, Adam... if something happens to me, you'll be needed here. Well, just be sure that nothing happens to you! You're my favorite sister! For the honor of Grayskull! I AM SHE-RA! On Christmas Eve, Santa hitches up his reindeer and flies all over the world bringing presents to boys and girls! Presents! I think I like this Santa! Can I meet him? Oh, no! He only brings presents when you're asleep! When you're asleep?! Well, just as long as he brings them... Tell me about Dingle's Bell? You mean, Jingle's Bell? I mean, Jingle Bells! And if we don't find one, there's no way to get Orko back. A water crystal? Yes! I know where one is, She-Ra. But it will not be easy to get. It lies in a deep pool - near the old ruins. And it's guarded by the Beast-Monster. The Beast-Monster is real? I thought it was just a legend. The Beast-Monster is no legend, She-Ra. It exists and is very dangerous. But if we work together... Good idea! Meet me at the ruin. If you can keep the creature out of the pool long enough, I'll find the water crystal for you! Thanks, Mermista. Fly, Swift Wind! So, this is the pool of the Beast Monster. Hmph! Doesn't look as though anyone's home! Uh, oh! Someone's home! The Beast-Monster! Keep him busy as long as you can, She-Ra! I'll do my best! Swifty! Those ruins wont hold him long! Now, where's Mermista? I've found it! Thanks, Mermista! I'm always happy to help. Good luck! I hope this brings Orko back. We could never have found it without Mermista. What's that? I don't know! But it looks as though we've found something else too! What are they? Some kind of sensors, I think... It's a robot! Well Swifty, now we have to pass those things to get the crystal back to Man-At-Arms. Watch it, Swifty! Monstroids, leave her. We must go to Monstroid Center and prepare to battle. They're changing into other forms! What evil robots! Very evil. And very dangerous. They're called the Monstroids. Our little friends, the Manchines, once told me about them. I'm afraid we haven't see the last of these evil things. Now let's get out of here! Sword, to blaze! Better stand back, Swifty. It's going to get a little warm. Now let's get the crystal back to Man-at-Arms. Even if the crystal works, we'll need help from Orko. I hope he remembers to stand in the light. It's working! Now it's up to Orko. Jingle Bells! Jingle Bells! Jingle Bells! What's that? I don't know. I'm afraid. Wait! Man-at-Arms has a transport beam. Now, what did he tell me? Stand in the light. Orko! Don't be scared, Elisha. I think i know what it is. I hope. All we have to do is hold hands and move over there. Where is he? There he is! No, there they are. Orko! Who are your friends? This is Elisha and Miguel. We're so glad you're safe! But what happened? It's a long story and it all started when i got into the Sky-Spy... There is a great disturbance! A new spirit of goodness has arrived on Eternia! The power of Horde Prime may be threatened. Send for Skeletor and Hordak! Immediately! So, that's the story. And here we are! Well, I can't believe it! You really crash-landed on Earth. Will we be home in time for Christmas? I'm not sure... Duncan? I can't be sure... It may take a few days to recharge the water crystal... But then we'll miss Christmas! I've got an idea! Christmas isn't for several days yet, but the twins birthday is tomorrow... Why don't we combine their birthday celebration with a big, big Christmas party. That would be fine. But what about Santa? Will he be able to find us? Of course, Elisha. Now, don't worry. Who's Santa? Who's Santa!? You don't know who Santa is? I can't beleive it! Everybody knows who Santa is! The arrival of this spirit of Christmas on Eternia may threaten my rule! I don't need anymore good will and brotherhood on that planet. Find it and crush it! Have no fear, great master! I will eliminate this... this Christmas spirit before another day has passed. You! You can't even handle that muscle-bound female, She-Ra! Just a minute! What about the way He-Man handles you, bone-brain? Bone-brain! Why, you miserable excuse for a villain! Silence! Stop wasting my time! Whoever eliminates the spirit of Chrismas on Eternia will be well rewarded! That's me! We'll see about that! Well, Elisha, how do you like it here on Eternia? Everybody here is nice, but I miss Mom and Dad. Oh, don't be sad, children, you'll be home soon, and until then, I'll make it seem like Springtime. No, Perfuma, Christmas is in a winter. Winter? Oh, no sooner said then done! Perfuma! That's wonderful! We've got just the right setting for my new Christmas song! Let's try it! Love and caring, peaceful bliss... Joys of sharing, happiness... Christmas spirit's in the air, Eternia and everywhere. Don't you feel it? Feel that you're a part? Christmas season is a time of your heart. Now, that's the Christmas spirit! There they are! Get the tractor beam ready! It's Hordak! Run! Help! Help! Hey! Put them down! You'll be sorry! Wait 'til He-Man and She-Ra find out! You won't get away with this! We've got them, Master. Good. Take us back to Etheria, Catra. We couldn't get to Orko and the children. Hordak was to quick with his freeze-beam. Were you able to track him? Yes, in the beginning. But Hordak was taking them to Etheria. I don't know where they are now. Well, the first thing we have to do is find them. Right, let's check with Peekablue. Maybe her multivision can help find the children. Oh, the Monstroids. We'd better get out of here. What's going on? Why did you stop us? These prisoners were being delivered to Horde Prime. The prisoners stay here. You may go. You don't think I'd leave them here!? I don't care what you think. You have 10 seconds to gather your beast companions and depart. What!? No bucket of bolts is going to push Hordak around! Ten,... nine,... eight, seven,... Err... on the other hand, I do have some urgent business elsewhere! Just wait 'til Horde Prime hears about this! Place the creatures in prison! When Horde Prime comes for them, we will deal with him. As you command, Number One! We know the children are in the Fright Zone, but we don't know where! I'll try to help. I see them! They've been captured by the Monstroids. I knew we'd have trouble with them again. Yes. But the little robot people have gone to rescue the children. Robot people? You mean the Manchines? Exactly! And they'll need help. The Monstroids are very powerful. Don't worry, Peekablue. We'll cut them down to size. Let's go, sis. This is a pretty mess! And it's all my fault! No, it isn't, Orko! You were trying to help us! Well, I didn't do a very good job... Hello! Who are you? My name is Cutter. What's yours? I'm Orko. And this is Elisha and Miguel. But... but how did you know we were here? We're the Manchines. The Monstroids are our enemies. C'mon, let's get you out of there! But how? The windows got bars! They don't call me Cutter for nothing! Watch! Oh, wow! Climb out, quickly! My cousin's waiting! Who? My cousin! Here he comes now. Boy! He's fast! They don't call him Zipper for nothing. Zipper! There's a Monstroid just around the corner. Here we go! Ow! Hang on! Don't worry! He can't keep up with me! Watch this! Grab them! I think we've got a problem. Put them back in the cells. And the Manchines with them! You're pretty good at giving orders, metal-mouth. Now, let's see how good you are at taking them! Move away from my friends! It's He-Man! Seize him! Keep your claws to yourself! Sorry to get you all tied up! The human creature is a lout. Teach him a lesson! I think you need a lesson in adding, iron-head. Sword, to lasso! Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy! What works for my sister, works for me! Monstroids! Monstroids! Attack the intruders! Zipper, we'd better call our cousins! He-Man and She-Ra need help! Right! Orko, why don't you find a safe spot for the children? Right! The odds look a bit uneven. Oh, no they don't, He-Man! It's Cutter! And the Manchines! C'mon, Cutter! We'll send the Monstriods back to the junkyard! Right where they belong! Let's get to work! Oh, look! A Manchine puppy! He's so cute! Ah, there they are! Horde Prime will reward me richly if I deliver those two Earth children. What? Ha! Got you at last, you troublesome tots! Let them go! Well, the bigger they are, the harder they fall! Thanks for your help! We... He-Man! She-Ra! Look! Skeletor's taken the kids! We'll se about that! Swift Wind! Oh, no, you don't, She-Ra! Heh-heh, ha-ha-ha-ha! I've done it! I've captured the two Earthlings. Now nothing can stop me from delivering them to Horde Prime. Don't be so sure, bone-head! What?! It's Hordak! Drat him, he wants the reward himself! Well, I'll soon take care of him. That skull faced scoundrel has damaged my ship! Now I'll have to turn back! But first, I'll make sure that he doesn't go anywhere! No! We're going down! I'll get you for that, Hordak! We'll have to crash land in that snow. Swift Wind, are you alright? Yes, but where are the children? Skeletor got away with them. But don't worry, now that you're free, we'll get them back! Let's go, brother! Drat that Hordak, he'll be back with reinforcements! Well, we won't be here! Get moving, you two! We have a long walk ahead of us! I... I... I don't think... we can mo... mo... move. It... it's awfully... co... cold. I said move! Move it! Ple... please, mister! Be nice! It... it's Christmas time. Christmas time? What's that? It... it's a se... season of love and joy. And caring. Bah! Is that what Christmas is? No wonder Horde Prime wants to get rid of it. A season of love!? Caring!? Joy!? Yuck! What a disgusting idea! Well, there's no Christmas spirit here. Now, get moving, you two, before Hordak comes back. I... I'm sorry, mister, but,... but we're so cold! So, you're cold! Oh, blast it. Oh, I'm warm again! Thank you, Mr. Skeletor, you are very kind. Kind! Never use that word around me! Now, get moving! Oh! Wait, I have to get Relay. No! Leave him! But, he'll freeze! We have to! I said leave him! Now, move! Please! Oh, blast it! I don't know what's coming over me! But whatever it is, I don't like it! Oh, stop licking my face, you dratted dog! Get away from me! You're drawning me! Get off! It was nice of you to save Relay, Mr Skeletor. I am NOT nice! Oh, stop that! You want me to hold him? No, no, no... we'll go faster if I carry him! Tell me more about this... this Christmas. Well, it's a wonderful time of the year. Everyone has a lots of fun. You mean they get in fights? No, no, they have fun! Fights are fun. I like fights. And you give each other presents. And when you open them, they explode, right? No, they're nice gifts. Nice! Doesn't sound like much fun to me! A Snow-Beast! Quick, get behind me! So much for the Snow-Beast! Oh, thank you, Mr. Skeletor! You saved us! You really are wonderful! Listen! I am NOT nice! I am NOT kind! And I am NOT wonderful! And I'm still delivering you to Horde Prime. There they are! Please, Mr. Skeletor, we don't want to be taken by Horde Prime! Please, don't! Let them go, bone-face! She-Ra and He-man! Drat! We'll take those children! No, I'll take those children! Hordak! Double drat! That's right, Skeletor! I figured you'd show up here! When you two are finished, we'll take the children! Now hand them over! Horde Prime will know who's Number One. They're mine, Hordak! Good aim! You hit yourself! Now, I'll take those goody-goods. Not if we can help it, Hordak! Better get back, children. Orko, go with them. Right! You're not delivering them to Horde Prime! Forget it, He-Man! The little fools are delivering themselves to Horde Prime. What... what is it? It's... Horde Prime! C'mon, She-Ra, we must stop him! Robots! Get them! Hang on, Orko! We're on our way! That's enough for me! Here, catch, brother! Thanks, sis! Good work, brother, now let's get the children! Uh-oh! Too late, She-Ra! Horde Prime's got them! Aaaah! What? What? What? I don't know what's happening to me... ...but I must save the children! Blast! That Skeletor's hit my engines! Horde Prime's ship is down! Let's go, She-Ra! I think Horde Prime's going to be angry with me... You have made me angry, Skeletor! Very angry, indeed! Quickly, He-Man! Let's send this troublemaker back home! Right you are, She-Ra! Ready? HEAVE! No! Blast! Blast! Blast! Blaaast! There! That'll take care of Horde Prime for a while. Skeletor! Skeletor! Thanks so much! He saved us! HE saved YOU?! Yes... I... I guess I did... I wish I knew why? Oh! Oh! I don't think I feel well. Well, I think you're feeling with Christmas spirit, Skeletor. It makes you feel... good. Well, I don't like to feel good! I like to feel evil! Ooooh... Don't worry, Skeletor, Christmas only comes once a year. Aaah... thank goodness! Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! Here! A flying belt for each of you! Oh, thank you, Santa! It's too bad you can't stay for the party, but I'm sure your parents miss you very much. We miss them too! But, Man-at-Arms says we'll be home soon. That's right, Miguel. You'll be home just in time to hang up your stocking. Ready to go? Wait! Relay, go to Adora! Will you make sure Relay gets back to the Manchines, Adora? Of course, Elisha! And, Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, everyone, and thank you! Oh, thank heavens you're back! We were so worried! Oh, mother, father! It was great! We went to another planet and... Oh, Miguel, don't make up stories! Tomorrow you can tell us where you really were! We're just glad to have you home safe. But we did go to another planet, mom! Honest! And we met Orko and Santa Claus gave us these flying belts! Now, now, now, Elisha... I don't know where you got those... those things, whatever they are, but it is bedtime. OK, father. - Goodnight! - And Merry Christmas! Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas, young lady! Merry Christmas,... ...brother! Oh... you knew it was me all the time, didn't you? Ah-huh! Well, Merry Christmas, sis! Merry Christmas, everybody! So, that's how Christmas first came to Eternia. Not everyone celebrates Christmas, but the spirit of the Christmas season is within us all. It's a season of love, and joy, and caring. And presents! Presents are nice, Orko, but Christmas means much more than that. I know, Adam! Christmas is a time of peace, and caring, and happiness. That's right, Orko! And what would make you happiest this Christmas? Presents! Oh, Orko!
