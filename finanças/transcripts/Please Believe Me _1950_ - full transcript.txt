[music continues] [music continues] - Alison, we're late. - Alright, alright. Well, come on, hurry up! - Texas again. - Good. Writing that often, what does he find to say? There is a great deal to say about life on a big ranch. - Big? - Very. They call it, "Thirty Mile Ranch." Fifty thousand acres, ten thousand head of cattle. Listen to this. "Dear, little girl I was thinkin' of you this morning, little part." - Part? - It means partner. Partner? It means part-ner. But you're not his partner. No, no, no, they don't mean partner the way we mean partner. They mean buddy. - Buddy? - You know, friend, pal, chum. Oh, why doesn't he say chum? Because he says part. Oh. "I was thinkin' of you this morning, little part. As I looked out to the east west and south.." He never looks towards the north, if he can help it. It's the only direction to which he can see land he doesn't own. "The cattle are just beginning to stir in the fields. "Soon, the boys will be starting out to ride our boundary fences in every direction." - Cowboys. - Yes. Can't you just see them? Strumming their banjos as they set off about their day's work. They ride out from the ranch house tall in the saddle. Their eyes narrowed to slits as they pass the ornery cattle rustler without even speaking to him. Oh, it all sounds simply wonderful. Has he ever sent you any snaps of the place? No. He never has sent me a picture of the estate. [donkey braying] - Morning! - Mornin'. - Where's Hank? - Out there. - 'When?' - 'Buried him this morning.' Uh, I've been afraid of something like that. He said he was feelin' kinda mangy when he'd come for supplies, last week. Oh, we're just fixin' to read the will. Do you wanna sit in? Thank you kindly. Alright, Pete, let her rip. [clears throat] "Being of sound mind and, uh.." Oh, we'll skip that stuff. Get down to the big question. "To my old and faithful friend "Tom Welsh "I leave my highly-valued rifle '"with a silver engraved barrel' '"and hand-carved walnut stock.' "To my old friends, Pete Drago.." Eh, that's me. "...and Sam Smith.." - Eh, that's you. - Yeah. "I leave jointly, my completely equipped "camping outfit with a request that "when they are finished with it, they'd give it back '"to the government of the United States.' "To my old friend, Bill Hawkins "I leave my faithful steed with a request to him "not to breed that noble animal to any dame '"unworthy of his illustrious bloodlines.' "The balance of my estate comprising 50,000 acres "with all the livestock there on.. "The buildings and rolling stock there too.. "...and all appurtenances and ordinances "I leave to Alison Kirbe of London, England who befriended a lonely old man in a strange land." Old Hank certainly must've enjoyed writin' that. Did he really own 50,000 acres? - Wouldn't make any difference. - Yeah. There ain't no land around here a week's travel worth ten cents an acre. Oh, what are we gonna do about this? - Tear it up, I guess. - Uh! No, I'll take it in to Lawyer Jenkins. - Let him send the word on. - Yeah. - Mail, but do it legal. - Yes, sir. Old Hank certainly must've enjoyed writin' that. [fog horn blaring] Alison, what have you got in these bags? They're getting awfully heavy. I told you we should get a porter. Here's a girl who's inherited millions and you're still trying to save us two shillings. Well, there's no sense in chucking it about. Don't quarrel, darlings. Tony's right. I really haven't any of the money till I get there! There she is. Porter? You know, Terry, your luck really isn't very good. - You can say that again. - Okay, it ain't very good. Alison, how do you really feel? - Frankly? - Frankly. - Revoltingly happy! - Alison, look. That's the way rich people do it. [dramatic music] - We'll go and find a steward. - Alright. Why, hello. I don't think we know each other? Oh, but I'm sure we've met. Oh, no, of course not.. I, uh, I was reading about you in the paper. Very interesting article. (Alison) 'It's not a very good picture though.' Certainly doesn't do you justice. Well, um, I hope we'll see each other aboard. Hey, he's takin' my suitcase! - Pardon me? - He's takin' my suitcase! Oh, Vincent, uh, Vincent! You made a mistake! Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Vincent! My, uh, man's a little hard of hearing. I'm so sorry. A little stupid of us, wasn't it? Yes, it was! Well, he isn't very bright. Well, I better be going. Oh, uh, by the way, my name is Keath. K-E-A-T-H. Terence Keath. Hello. Uh, I'll send the bag to you, Miss Kirbe as soon as we get aboard the ship. - See that you do. - Some people have all the luck. First, she inherits a ranch, then she marries a millionaire on the boat going over. Oh, he seemed awfully nice. - And rich. - And weak. (male announcer) 'All ashore that's going ashore, all visitors ashore--' Now, Sylvia, stop crying. - Well, I'll try not to. - Goodbye, darling. - Take care of yourself. - Yes, I will. You too. - And write often, won't you? - I will. - Please, may I join in now? - C281. - Goodbye, Tony. - Goodbye, Alison. Look after Sylvia. Do take care of them. - Goodbye, Alison. - Goodbye, dear. - 'Goodbye!' - 'Bye, Alison.' - 'Have a good time.' - 'Goodbye.' - 'Well, goodbye.' - 'Goodbye!' Bye! Very beautiful girl. I don't need a lawyer to tell me that. I'm not telling you, I'm warning you. Now, look, Jeremy, we don't go on the big boat until you agree. - I agree! - Not so fast. Look, let's talk about it later-- No, we'll talk about it right now. What's got into you! I'm sick and tired of it. That's what's gotten into me. - I'm a-- - Corporation lawyer. Years of my life have been devoted to the study-- Constitutional law. - And corporate structure. - Granted! - And how do I spend my time? - Traveling? The most sordid end of the legal profession appeasing, averting, and settling breach of promise suits against you. You know my last lawyer adored that in me? Your last lawyer was disbarred. Ah-ah, only a little bit disbarred. I'm serious, Jeremy. No girls, not even a midget. Otherwise, I'll lock you in your cabin all the way across. Oh, I've got to eat sometime between here and New York. - Fast boat. - Oh, no, no, that's unfair. That's duress, that's undue influence. It's.. It's.. I promise. (male announcer) 'All ashore that's going ashore.' I solemnly promise not to talk to any strange women on this boat! - Satisfied? - Let's go. - No point getting on the boat! - Come on. [fog horn blaring] Write. [all clamoring] - Who are you waving at? - Anybody. [fog horn blaring] [sighs] Oh, dear. What's the matter, ducky? Little by little, I seem to be losing all my luggage. First, someone took a suitcase by mistake on the pier. Now, the rest of my things are missing. Better tell the stewardess. I rang 20 minutes ago. No doubt, she'll be around when she feels like it. [doorbell buzzing] Come in! - Miss Alison Kirbe? - I'm Miss Kirbe. Oh, your things have been moved, miss. Moved? But I'm in the right cabin surely. No, miss, you're been transferred to Stateroom 16 on A-deck, in the first class. First class? Must be some mistake. Oh, I doubt it, miss. The person himself sent me down to tell you. If you'll just come with me, miss. Just follow me, miss. - Bye. - Bye. - Well! - Well! [instrumental music] - Little porch? - A private deck, miss. This must cost a fortune. Oh, it does, miss. I don't understand. I'm a little muddled myself, miss. [door closes] [music continues] [doorbell buzzing] Come in! Hello? Gee, I-I hope you haven't needed anything in this. Oh, no, not yet. How ever did you find me? I'm listed in the second class. Yes, I know you were. Thank you very much, Mr. Keath but you've got entirely the wrong idea. Oh, wait a moment. You-you-you misunderstand. No, you do. - Oh, oh, it isn't that at all. - Perhaps not. Let's just say that a suite of this kind is a little too magnificent to be anything else. Yeah, but it is something else. What? Well, it's, uh, kind of hard to explain. - Precisely. - Well.. Won't you just listen to what I have to say? My dear Mr. Keath, in the ATS I drove American officers. I know what you're going to say so well, I could say it for you. Look, uh, Miss Kirbe, uh my-my-my father and your, uh, benefactor, Hank Wadburn were old friends, why, for years. - I-- - Mr. Keath. If it isn't what I thought it was, I apologize. But if it is, I must say it's superbly an awful approach. Well, please, now if-if you just, uh sit down and relax, I'll-I'll explain the whole thing to you. You see, one of my family's estates is in Texas. Now, Hank Wadburn and my father were old friends. Even you know how kind old Hank was. He did many favors for us. Advice and, well, even more than that. He, uh, handled the sale of, uh, most of our surplus stock. I'm beginning to feel rather awful. So, you see, I couldn't let anyone who meant so much to an old family friend, uh, uh just travel second class. Oh, dear. I'm sorry. I still can't possibly accept it. You know, you have to get used to the fact that you have money now to spend, you know. But that's just it, I don't have the money until I get to Texas. Which is why you must let me lend it to you. But I can't let you lend it to me, truly. Even though your motives are the best in the world it would look most odd. People would think all sorts of things. Pe.. Oh. Uh, that's, eh, final? Final. Oh, gee, well, I-I'm awfully sorry that you feel this way about it. So am I. You'll have them move me back? Uh, yes. It is a very pleasant room. Oh-oh, it is a very pleasant room. Would you promise to let me pay you back when I get my money? Of course, when you get your money. After all, if I did stay here, there'll be more space for the other three in my old cabin. You've got a wonderful face, you know that? And there really wouldn't be anything wrong with it? Good girl. Oh, and, uh, I've already made arrangements for you to have my place at the captain's table. - Thank you. - Uh, well.. I'll see you. [instrumental music] Well? Well? I pulled that Texas routine on her, and it worked beautifully. Sure, it worked. Who's gonna refuse a first class cabin? - Well, she almost did. - What happens now? Well, first, Miss Kirbe and I get to be friends. Friends? Eh, this will probably make absolute no sense to you, Vincent but I can hardly marry the girl until I get to know her! Look, Terry, Lucky Riley sent me along to watch his investment in you-- Oh, not that again. Yes, that again! He holds five, kid. Count 'em! - Five of your IOUs. - Six. I played another spin at that wheel while you were out calling a taxi. You make me extremely antagonistic. I make you what? I read it in a book. Look here, kid, you just gotta get married this trip. You've gotta get them IOUs back. Oh, if I'd only played my lucky number in that last half hour. Eh, well, you played just long enough to get yourself in a real jam. Now, you gotta get out! You know, Riley bankrolled you on the basis you was gonna marry a rich dame. So, what happens, we crossed the drink back and forth, forth and back and you haven't hit yet. I'm gettin' sick of the sea. Thirty-three came five times in that last half hour. Look, Terry, will you please keep your mind on your work? Kid, fortune hunting is just like any other business. You gotta work at it! - I gotta work at it? - Yeah. Listen, I-I talked to the mothers. I danced with their daughters. What I'm doing is worse than babysitting. I-I go for walks in the moonlight with them. I-I get up early and I go to bed late! I work hard. Well, kid, I guess you just ain't got what it takes. Oh, I don't know about that. [indistinct chatter] Good evening, uh.. - Miss Kirbe. - Miss Kirbe. Uh, this way, please. [indistinct chatter] Miss Kirbe. I'm Mrs. Milwright, uh, this is my daughter Lily, and my son, Peter. I do find the Clayton Line most satisfactory, don't you? I'm afraid I'm not much of a judge of steamship lines. Embarkation is always tiresome though. All these people going abroad for the first time. [Mrs. Milwright laughing] That's curious whipping up of an excitement that vulgar shouting goodbyes and crying. It's really a bore, don't you think? I didn't notice, I was too busy shouting and crying. Good evening, Mrs. Milwright. Lily, Peter-- - Oh, captain. - Good evening, Miss Kirbe. - Good evening, captain. - Oh, you seem to be alone. Wonder who your dinner partners are? Oh, yes, Matt Kinston and Jeremy Taylor. We had young Taylor aboard before. - Usually late. - Oh. Lord Duff. Taylor.. The Jeremy Taylor. My dear, it must be very uncomfortable for you sitting alone there on your first trip. You did say it was your first trip, didn't you? Why don't you change places with Lily? Then you can come and sit with Peter and me. Lily, get out. No, not a word, dear. I won't listen. We must make your first trip a memorable one. Lily, I said, "Get up." We can't have.. Change places with her. You sitting all by yourself. Lily, don't sit there, move. On your first crossing, can we? - Lily? - Yes, mother. - Oh, Mr. Taylor. - Good evening. Remember what I told you, you don't talk to anyone unless I introduce you to. Okay, okay. - Lily, sit down. - Thank you. - Yes, mother. - Hello, I, uh.. I believe I saw you getting on board. Yes, I was shouting and crying. Oh, really? I didn't notice. You passed us going up the gangplank. Sorry, I bit you. Oh, my shoulders are broad. I have a very healthy tailor. - He really is crazy. - Oh. By the way, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Kinston, Matt Kinston. How do you do? - I'm Alison Kirbe. - And I'm Jeremy Taylor! I'm Mrs. Milwright, and this is my daughter, Lily. - Lily, say hello to Mr. Taylor. - Hello. You cleverly arranged it, so she's sitting at the captain's table. - Right. - Between two wolves! - Don't worry. - Don't worry? The investment gets bigger every minute. Ocean trips, now, staterooms for everybody flowers, candy, perfume-- Hardly seems enough, does it? You mean, there's gonna be more? Vincent, there's no joy in you. Oh, it's lovely, isn't it? - Nope. - Huh? - It's wrong, all of it. - Wrong? I never figured out why people think a boat deck is romantic. It's sort of like taking a girl for a ride in an open car thinking she's enjoying herself. Now, you know, no woman can enjoy herself with her hair blowing all over her face. But I like it here. Besides being windy, it's cold. I'm not cold. I-I-I think you are. Now, supposing you would let me kiss you.. ...what chance would I have? I'm trying to make an impression on you while secretly inside, you're shivering.. ...but not the right way. - The prosecution rests? - No. The prosecution suggests you come with me. The most romantic place in the world. Wait. Swaying palms. Oh. Music? [instrumental music] And moonlit waters. You're very ingenious, Mr. Kinston. Not really, just careful planning. Then, I must be equally careful not to upset your planning. - Mustn't I? - Oh, in what way? You obviously brought me here with the intention of making love to me. So, I suppose, I must just let you make love to me. I suggest that you kiss me here first and then here. Well? No, here first, please. - Thank you, Mr. Kinston. - You're wel.. Thank you very much, uh.. And, of course, Lily has had so many offers to go on the concert stage. Talented girl. But we have refused them all. You've no idea how they pleaded with her. But-but Lily wanted to be just a wife and mother. Well, bedtime! [sighs] - Oh, it's you. - Oh, what I saved you from. - Thanks, chum. - I can't figure that girl out. I don't know whether she's Delilah and baby face Little Red Riding Hood or what! I don't even know whether I owe her an apology or she owes me one? I'll find out for you tomorrow. You stay away from her, if she's too smart for me how do you think you'll make out? Terribly, but I can afford it. 'Not as long as you're my client.' Look, Matt, I have a little over $15 million. Now, I know it's not supposed to be nice to talk about one's money, but I happen to like money. It's been in my family for years. - 'Go on.' - Well, that's it. You see, I'm a lily of the field that's what I was born for, to enjoy myself. But you won't let me just because you think it'll spoil your record. 'Alright, get yourself another lawyer.' Oh, now, that doesn't make any sense. You're brilliant about all the business things. - I need you. - 'So?' So, this, I happen to think you're wrong about this girl, but that's beside the point. All I ask is if some charming young thing wants to clip me for 50 or 100,000.. ...please, just once in a while, let her. - Are you finished? - Yes. Goodnight! Eh, well, good morning. - This is a pleasant surprise. - Well, good morning. Ahh, it's a beautiful morning, isn't it? Mmm. Uh, how would you like to talk about beef cattle this morning? - Dead or alive? - Oh, both ways. Uh, may I have a cigarette, Vincent? Market cattle, you know? Oh, I don't know too much about them aside from the fact that a cow is a four-legged animal entirely unsuited for city living. Or if it helps any, I once learned an elocution line. "How now brown cow." Okay, we don't talk about cattle. - Oh, I'm sorry-- - Eh? I promise to listen carefully from now on. - Will that be all, Mr. Keath? - Uh, yes, Vincent, that's all. You see here, the selling of cattle is, uh, quite a complicated operation and.. - Oh. - Good morning. - Mr. Kinston, Mr. Keath. - Hello. Somebody's selling cattle here today? Well, I was about to explain the workings of the livestock. Oh, go right ahead. Don't let me stop you. Thank you. Uh, now, you see, you must first take into consideration the, uh, green market-- I imagine the Chicago quotation is very important too? The Chicago quotations are very important, very! Well, they're being posted in the lounge right now. - Uh, now? - Now. Oh. Excuse me. I'm afraid I owe you an apology. I was rather fresh last night. I do think you might have waited till we'd known each other a little longer than an hour. Say, an hour and half? Even two hours wouldn't be considered exactly Victorian. Well, look, I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll start all over again, and this time you tell me where you'd like to go. Why can't we stay here? Well, there's too much to be seen. The whole ship to be inspected. And Terry will be back with the Chicago quotation? Yeah. Look, we'll start at the bottom. The first thing we'll do is inspect the.. But, of course, I'm serious. What ever made you think that I wasn't? I'm so happy. - Good morning. - Good mor.. - Shall we? - Yes. Darling, I forgot my purse. Oh, I'll get it for you. Stateroom 22, A-deck, right? Right. - I'll go with you. - Good! I'll tell you what. We'll begin at the bottom. We'll start with the en.. Do you mind if we take this up some other time? - Not at all. - Thank you. Something very important just came up. I gotta take care of it right away. - Well, how did it work? - It worked like a charm. -Madame,you were perfect. - It was a lot of fun. Jack, thank you very much for the loan of your wife. - I trust you, Jeremy. - But of course. - But not out of sight. - Well, of course! [chuckles] Well, hello. - You all alone? - Deserted. Well, it's those legal fellows for you. Business, business, business. You seemed to have got rid of your young lady rather quickly. Oh, she's not my young lady. She's the wife of a friend of mine. - Pretty smooth, eh? - Mm-hm. Come on, let's get out of here. No, I want to have a long talk with you. - Oh, about what? - You. Oh, my favorite subject. How long have you known Matt Kinston? [instrumental music] [doorbell buzzing] Come on, Jeremy, open up. [knocking] Jeremy, I know you're in there. [knocking on door] Alright, come out, or I'm comin' in! Oh, excuse me. Oh, just a minute, eh, Vincent? I'm afraid you have the advantage of me, sir. - Don't you remember me? - I'm afraid not, sir. Well, then, perhaps, I can refresh your memory. I once had a case in the criminal courts. There was a witness for the other side. A slight case of perjury. Among other things, uh, assault possession of stolen goods-- I remember you. Tell me, what are you doing on this boat? - I got a little deal on. - Oh. Well, one thing, if it weren't for people like you there would be no legal profession, would they? - Bye, Vincent. - Goodbye, counselor. And he worked his way through, isn't that wonderful? I was under the impression that we were gonna talk about me. But we are! You were in Matt's class at school. No, he was in mine. Tell me, did he go in for athletics much? No. Always had his nose buried in a book. After you graduated, what did he do? - I don't know. - Studied law. - And then? - He became a lawyer. And a very good one. Oh, yes, there was nothing he couldn't tell you about corporate structure and.. You! - Lunch. - See, he identifies things. Now, what are you gonna do after lunch? Well, we haven't decided. Well, let's decide together. How about the Tropic Room? - Tropic Room? - You know, swaying palms? Moonlit waters? - Oh, yes. - Fine, I'll meet you there. - So will I. - You do that. I will. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] You know, I've been wondering about something. What? How come you let me brush Jeremy off with that Tropic Room routine? - Why shouldn't I? - Oh, I don't know. Most girls wouldn't. He's quite rich. I got a hint of that when he was explaining to me that he doesn't feel any better off now that he has 15 million than he did when he had 14. Money doesn't mean anything to you then? I didn't say that. [indistinct chatter] Well, fancy seeing me here. Excuse me. Must you act like a Water Spaniel? Oh, I can work things out too, you know. When I went to our cabin and saw your clothes I knew that one of two things had happened. Either you were gone to the swimming pool or you were running around the ship's dock naked. Thanks for giving me the benefit of the doubt. I didn't. Well, now what are you going to do with yourself? Sit around here with this old man all day? We're young, we're lovely. Let's enjoy ourselves. Let's make like athletes. [women laughing] Oh, no. - We swim. - We swim. Hello, going swimming? Uh, as soon as we get our clothes off. Yes, we are. Would you like to join us? Oh, I'd love to. Oh, by the way, uh, you're Jeremy Taylor, aren't you? - Yeah. - I know you. - I'm Terry Keath. - How are you? Would you do me a favor? Thanks a lot. [water splashing] Come on in! It's wonderful! [splashing] I'm not very good at this, I'm afraid. Oh, don't worry. I'll take care of you. - Oh. - Come on. [indistinct chatter] It's a race! [crowd cheering] [crowd cheering] Help. [gasping] Don't panic! [gasping] Don't panic! I'll get you out! Thank you. Get rid of these for me, will you? Yes, sir. Oh, I'm sorry, I couldn't make it to dinner. I took a nap and overslept. Do you mind if I join you? Thank you. Not at all. Terry was just showing me how the cattle market operates. Oh, really? Tell me, do you often sit and talk to girls about cattle? Only when they're interested. I guess I'll have to get around more. I was interested. Okay, by tomorrow I'll be an expert on longhorns and all the other kinds of cattle. By the way, what other kinds are there? - Oh, there are many breeds. - 'Like what?' Hertfordshire, Aberdeens Black Angus, bahamas, shorthorns. The longhorns Jeremy mentioned are no longer considered efficient stock. And "How now brown cow?" Look at that tie. (Jeremy) 'Thank goodness, you could see it too.' - My tie. - Speaking about cattle.. A very funny thing happened to me the other day on the way-- - My tie. - Why do you keep saying that? - My tie! - It's a nervous condition. Sometimes he says the same two words for weeks at a time. Very funny, my.. Come on, give me the tie! I haven't got it. Either you produce, or I'll wear yours. You know, this could go on all night. Uh, steward, I'm Mr. Keath, would you phone Stateroom 24 and ask my man to bring up a black bow tie? - Yes, sir. - Oh. [telephone ringing] Yes. What? Okay. [instrumental music] - Allow me, sir. - Hm? Oh. Merci. Merci beaucoup. Nothing at all. [instrumental music] - You sent for this, sir? - Oh, it's for Mr. Kinston. Oh, Vincent. I'm afraid you've mistaken me for someone-- - Oh, not again, Vincent. - Yes, sir. Oh, now, don't go away. I'll need you. - To, uh, tie this for me. - But, sir, I-- Besides, I wanna talk to you. - Me, sir? - Yes, you, sir. - Perhaps, we better go. - 'That won't be necessary.' - How about a walk on deck? - Lovely. - 'Good idea.' - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Yes, you two stay here and have a nice heart to heart. Let's sit down, Vincent. [instrumental music] Careful, Vincent. Careful. So, you've got a little deal on, huh? Look, counselor, we ain't steppin' on your toes. - Why butt in? - I'll make sure that you don't. Jeremy Taylor is my client. Are you and Terence Keath in this together? - That's right. - And the girl? What about the girl? What do you think? - Now, don't get mad, counselor. - Don't worry. You're not sore at the girl? - Jeremy Taylor is my client. - Sure. Sure thing, counselor. - We'll lay off. - I'll make sure that you do. - 'Good morning.' - Good morning. Aren't you gonna sit down? Look, I'm not gonna play games with you anymore. - I'm angry and I'm disgusted. - What? I give you full credit. It was a very smart act. Very smart. Pretend to be interested in me but never lose sight of the guy with the money. - Okay, I went for it. - What are you talking about? I'm talking about a very sweet innocent girl who isn't interested in money, that's what I'm talking about! Oh! Oh! - Hey, hold that line, tiger. - Let me go! Easy. I've never hit a man before in my life but that friend of yours-- Easy, easy. Has Matt been talking to you? Talking. Well, he thinks you're interested in me for my money. He what? He thinks you're after me for my money. Why the insolent, insufferable, lonesome.. Oh, I wish I had thought of those. What made him think I had any interest in you? And if I had, how could he possibly think I'd be interested in you just because of your money. Well, what more reason could you want? And you went to school with him. Alison? Alison, don't be sore with me. I don't believe any of it. I should think not. Why should I worry about your money? I have plenty of money of my own. I've got so much money, I'm, I'm not quite used to it. I've got so much, I'm vulgar about it. I'm, I'm,nouveau riche. Come along. Terry, you said I could draw on you for anything I might need. Why certainly. I want to buy some things in the ship's arcade. Well, you go right ahead. You charge anything you want to me. Thank you. Come along, Jeremy. I'm living the life of a caboose. Vincent, my lad, I just had the thrill of a lifetime. - No. - Yeah. Well, come on, tell me. Exactly, how did it happen? Oh, oh, boy. Well, she started edging up just a little bit closer. - You mean it? - And it was beautiful. - Just beautiful. - Oh, it must've been. - Then what? - I was so calm and confident. It was great. Oh, I knew she was mine. Ha, Terry. Terry, you didn't go too far, did you? - What are you talking about? - What are you? The bet I made on the ship's run. What did you think I was talking about? I will never tell you as long as I live. A cigarette, Vincent. Only when other people are present. Oh. - We packed? - I am. - What's eating you? - Oh, nothing you'd care about. I take it, our young lady spent, uh, quite a bit today. Quite a bit? She went down to the ship's arcade and bought over $400 worth of merchandise. - What of it? - "What of it?" They were all presents for Jeremy Taylor, a guy who only has more money than anybody else in the country! Oh, so what? Listen, I don't mind her gettin' him cigarette cases. I don't even mind her buyin' him pen and pencil sets but why, with all his dough, did she had to get him a wallet? Calm yourself, Vincent. Everything is under control. Like how? That lawyer is out of our way now. Thanks to you. Tomorrow, as soon as we land, I'll whisk our young lady right off to Texas. Good. I'd like it, kid, but the minute you get her alone kneel down at her feet.. ...gaze up into her eyes.. ...and with trembling emotion speak. "Oh, my beloved, say yes to life. Say yes to love. Say yes to me." Vincent, you've been reading another book. Yeah. [instrumental music] Uh, Vincent will take care of your luggage for you. Uh, our train leaves in an hour. - I'm not going. - What? I'm staying over for a few days at the Amadon Hotel. - I own it. - That I know. But I've already cabled ahead for tickets. - Keep moving. - We'll talk later. - What? - I said, "We'll talk later." - What did you say? - She said, "Keep moving." [instrumental music] - Good morning, Mr. Kinston. - Good morning, Ms. Russell. Nice to see you back. How was the trip? Oh, wonderful, thanks. Wonderful. - Anyone with Mr. Warrender? - No, just Mr. Cooper. Take care of those for me, will you? - Uh, welcome back, my boy. - Thank you, sir. - Eh? - 'Nothing.' - 'He said, "Thank you, sir."' - Oh, you're welcome. - Matthew, my boy. - Hello, Mr. Cooper. Tell me, how did young Taylor behave, huh? The same as he always behaves, like an idiot. He got himself entangled with a girl. - What, another one? - On the boat. Remarkable the energy that boy has. Um, what's she like? She's beautiful, schemer, and smarter than most of them. Smarter? In what way? She told him she was an heiress. Place called Thirty Mile Ranch in Texas. Well, young fellow, we leave all that to you. I've always found the best way to settle these affairs was over a bird and a cold bottle. Hm. Hello, Ms. Russell, have my secretary contact our representative in Galveston. And tell him to get all the information he can on a place called Thirty Mile Ranch. No, it's near Goshen, Texas. [instrumental music] Alison, I've got to talk to you. Oh, why not come up with me? - I'll go along with you. - Come on, I'm in a hurry. I'd like to see how they treated you. If you don't mind, I'd like to speak to Alison alone. - I mind. - Going up? I still would like to speak to her alone. This makes no difference to me. Now, what was the big idea! Uh, it was very important that I talk to her. I just wanted to see how determined you were. - Come on, Terry. - Me too? No. [dramatic music] - I'll call a porter. - It isn't necessary, Vincent. I couldn't budge her. - She's gonna stay for a week. - On whose dough? Well, naturally, I had to offer to loan it to her. What's so natural about that? Oh, never mind, it's done. Now, I've called Reilly and I'm going out to see him and you are leaving for Texas on the next plane. What can I do down there? I don't even look like her. Different color hair for one thing. Oh, Vincent, you're gonna go down and look over the estates so you'll be able to give a full report on it to Reilly. - It may help. - Okay. As a matter of fact, kid if he feels the way I think he's gonna feel I just so not be here when it happens to you. Thank you. You're welcome. [dramatic music] - Hello. - Reilly is expecting me. Would you tell Reilly.. Through there. The door at the end. Hey, you! [dramatic music] Your check. Check? Thank you. [clears throat] [dramatic music] [gasps] Um! [dramatic music] [whistling] [whistling] [gasps] Hello, girl. Yeah, nice doggy. Good old girl. [instrumental music] That's it, girl. Yeah, good old girl. [music continues] That's it, girl. Yes. [dog growling] [barking] [dramatic music] - Hello, Reilly. - You're sweating. - Well, it's a warm day. - No, it's not. No, well, possibly not. What are you doin' up here? Well, I told you on the phone I'll need some more money. What did I tell you on the phone? You, uh, told me to.. [barking] Please, he asked me. How much will it take? Well, uh, 5000 should, uh, cover everything. I wonder if you're sticking close to business. On the phone, it sounded like you were thinkin' more of the girl than her money. [chuckles] Well, it must've been a bad connection. Maybe so. Maybe not. Bring her out tonight, I'll look her over. Oh, good. Thanks, Reilly. [coughing] [instrumental music] What do you think of it? Oh, it's very exciting, isn't it? Oh, it's about the same as most gambling joints. - Good evening, Mr. Keath. - Good evening. Pleasure to see you. Mr. Taylor, we don't see you in here often. - Why should I gamble? - I wouldn't know. Mr. Reilly, this is Ms. Kirbe. - How do you do, Miss Kirbe? - How do you do? Are you gonna try your luck with us? - Well-- - By all means. - Beginner's luck, you know. - You can't lose. Right this way, please. - Now, what will it be? - A hundred or so for-- A hundred dollars for the account of Miss Kirbe. I hope you won't need anymore. Good luck to you. Thank you, Mr. Reilly. It's a pleasure. Best percentage is the dice table, do you wanna play that? - Oh, I'd love to. - How about roulette? - I'd love to. - [indistinct] - Oh, I'd love to. - Well, roulette it is. [instrumental music] Twenty-one, red. Place your bets please, ladies and gentlemen. - How much is this one? - $50. (male #1) 'Place your bets please.' - How much is this one? - $5. (male #1) 'Your bets please.' Change please. Five, uh, $1 chips. - Thank you. - Thank you. Place your bets please. 'No more betting please. No more betting.' 'Thirty-one, black.' You better make up your mind beforehand. Place you bets please, ladies and gentlemen. Place your bets. - Sixteen. - Why sixteen? Because today's the date, of course. (male #1) 'Eleven, black.' I didn't win! Try again. Double up this time. Bet $2. (male #1) 'Place you're bet, ladies and gentlemen.' 'Please place your bet.' Plunge. Be back in a minute. - Well, Reilly. - She's no bluff. I'll say that for her. Bettin' a buck a throw. Looks like an interesting proposition. I, uh, I-I'd like the money tonight. We'll see. Haven't made up my mind yet. (male #1) 'Nineteen, red.' 'Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.' 'Please place your bets.' Twenty-four. Twenty-four. Twenty-three. - Twenty.. - 'Twenty-four, black.' Tee-hee. (male #1) 'Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.' 'Please place your bets.' There's dancing in the next room. Oh, no, just a few more rounds. Twenty-four. Hi. Excuse me. [instrumental music] Well, how did you get here? I'll let you in a little secret. Doorman talk. I see they didn't waste any time, did they? - How much you hooked for? - Me? Hooked? That's the oldest come-on in the world. They let her win 500 or 1000. You get the fever and you start playing big. - What are you in for? - Haven't bet a ten cent piece. You see that wild little thing over there? She is ahead all of $12 and she's as excited as a kid about it. I don't get it. Oh, you don't get anything unless the supreme court decides on it. [instrumental music] - Well, hello. - Hello. - Good evening. - Good evening. - How did you do? - I did good. I win me 16 bucks. Well, a gambling triumph like that calls for a small celebration. Doesn't the winner always buy the wine? - Good deal. - But of course. Very interesting place, isn't it? I didn't know you gambled, Mr. Kinston. Matter of fact, I don't. I, uh, I came out here tonight 'cause I found out you were going to be here. I'm here. I'm gonna follow some advice you gave me. I want to apologize this time. Did you drive all the way out here just to tell me that? No. I'd like to tell you how lovely you look this evening. - I won't do it. - You won't do what? Tell you to go ahead and say how lovely I look this evening. It's too easy a victory. Let me up, will you? I'm licked. Well, I'm buying the wine. I'd like to help you drink it. Shall we? [instrumental music] - I'll get you a menu. - Oh, no, you order. Uh, you order. Mr. Kinston. - Matt! - Well, thank you. Caviar, champagne, and crepes flambe for everyone. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Oh, dear, I think I better get back in the next room and win some more money. Oh, honey, now, you sit down. We'll wash the dishes. - Everything alright? - Wonderful. Mr. Reilly, won't you sit there? Thank you. Miss Kirbe won better than three pounds. What did you say Miss Kirbe won? Uh, Miss Kirbe won better than three pounds. More than three guineas. Oh, what's the difference? A pound is 20 shillings, and a guinea is 21 shillings. - Except there is no such thing. - Sure, there.. Huh? Well, you see, in English money, a pound is worth 20 shillings and a guinea is worth 21 shillings. Except there is no such thing. I'll tell him when he comes in. Uh, I don't think you quite understand. They don't coin guineas anymore, they just use them for counting in certain transactions. Well, certainly, uh, certainly. Of course, I understand. They don't have them which is why they use them. Shall we dance? Well, I hate to leave until I've cleared this up for you. Oh, no, no, I-I've got it. It's, it's all as clear as.. - It's clear. - Oh, good. [instrumental music] Are you lonesome? Reilly, a man in your line has to know his customers pretty accurately, doesn't he? He sure does. Tell me, what credit would you rate Miss Kirbe? Unlimited. How can you tell? Well, all you have to do is look at her. You can tell she's a genuine article. [instrumental music] Funny, how much you can tell about people just by lookin' at them. Now, take Terry.. ...he looks like a guy that would-- He sure does. Where do you think you'd be if you didn't have money? What about dad here? He looks like a guy that's just discovered something. - 'Thank you, Alison.' - You're welcome. [instrumental music] Reilly. - What about the money? - We got a deal. Good. [music continues] - You know something? - What? - Your education is incomplete. - How? Well, you can't pretend to be an expert on George Washington Bridges until you see ours over the Hudson. Then by all means I must see it. [instrumental music] It's a truly lovely George Washington Bridge. Now, why did I have to convince him that she was okay? When I'm the one who should be out there with her. Or me. No, he's not the man for her. By comparatively speaking, he hasn't got a quarter. And no charm. [instrumental music] Oh, how can he compete with us? He's a little lucky, but that's all. Absolutely all. And he's certainly no threat. Well, he isn't even in the running. [instrumental music] [dramatic music] - 'What happened?' - 'I don't know.' He asked me to bring him out here, and then when I did he took one look at the place and keeled over. [dramatic music] [donkey braying] [dramatic music] - 'Good morning.' - 'Good morning.' - Over here, by the window-- - Yes, ma'am. Oh, Matt, come in. Good morning, darling. Just stopped by on my way to the office. - Oh, what fun. - Ah, you look lovely. Darling, you had breakfast? Yeah, but I can use another cup of coffee. Oh, would you bring another cup, please? - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you. Oh, thank you. - Up to the top? - Not quite. - Cream? - A little, yeah. - Sugar? - Two, please. I'll remember. There you are. - Toast. - Hm. Buttered or dry? Buttered lightly, please. Lightly, of course. [knock on door] (Kirbe) 'Come in.' Good morning. - Morning, Terry. - Morning. - May I join you? - 'Please do.' Well, Matt just dropped in for coffee, would you like some? Oh, I'd love it. I'm awfully sorry. I wonder if you'd mind bringing another cup? [dramatic music] - Well, everything is set. - What? I picked up the tickets on the way over and our plane leaves at 2:30. But I'm-- Oh, I'd leave these decisions to me. You need guidance in business affairs, Alison. Oh, but not in an aeroplane. An up in the air contrivance. I can't fly. - You get sick. - Oh, well, latest thing. The army developed it during the war for air sickness. Won't work. - It's infallible. - For air sickness? - Right. - I get seasick on a plane. Seasick? - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, I see. Well, just in case I also made reservations on the evening train. I suppose you get airsick in a train? - That's silly. - That, oh.. Well, good, well, then we'll leave at-- I'll be perfectly alright on the train as long as there are no telephone poles. - Telephone poles? - Oh, yeah, she counts them. Let her count them. You see, in England the trains travel on the left. I'm used to counting them on the left. Here, they'd be on the right. You-you wouldn't want to injure her neck muscles, would you? - No. - I knew you'd understand. There is a boat that goes down the coast and around the gulf to Galveston. Oh, but really, listen you couldn't expect her to be comfortable on the coastal steamer after coming-- Is it okay with you if we walk? Oh, don't bring me into this. [knock on door] Come in. [instrumental music] Well, coffee. Waiter, I hate to ask you this, but.. Well, what's on for today? [door slams] We are not leaving by train, and we are not leaving by plane. As you came in, I was about to explore the possibilities of an ox cart. Oh, I can settle that for you. When in doubt, you take a girl shopping. Oh. I don't think we should. Oh, New York's got the most luxurious shops in the world. - Can you resist that? - Yes. - But not for very long. - Oh, what are we waiting for? Fine, I'll ride down the lobby with you. Are you sure the elevator is safe? Well, let's get going. Every minute we waste, we're saving you money aren't we, Terry? We won't be needing that now. [dramatic music] Oh, I certainly like that hat. Well, I still prefer the blue one. No, much too conservative. That one was only $40. This one is useless and extravagant and that's what makes a girl feel good. You know, I don't really need a fur coat. Well, let's look at it anyway. Just a moment, I'll get Mr. Renard. You're the one who seems to be getting all the fun out of this. Oh, boy, would you happen to be running a little short? Oh, it's not necessary. Thank you. - Good morning, Mr. Taylor. - Morning. And what can we do formadamethis morning? - I don't know. - No, we're just looking. Oh, there's nothing like a fur coat to set off the sparkle in your eyes. This,madame,is a good value, but not of our regular quality. - A nice serviceable mink. - Yes, for rainy days only. - Oh, it's not bad. - And only $2500. I don't really need a fur coat. But of course, you do. (Mr. Renard) 'May I try this one on,madame.' - 'Oh, that's much better.' - 'Oh.' And the bargain is $6000. Cheap. I don't really need a fur coat. - 'This is very smart.' - 'Oh.' - 'Ah, this is more like it.' - $15,000. Beautiful, isn't it? Here it is. We'll take this one. - Yes, sir, I'll pack it. - Yeah. Are you sure it's alright? Yes, but let's get out of here. Excuse me a moment. You put that down! [instrumental music] I thought you'd want this immediately, Mr. Kinston. - It's about your Texas enquiry. - Thank you. Property in Texas is worthless. Taylor was right. - She's a liar and a fraud. - Let Taylor have her. - I'm sorry, Matthew. - Oh. It's very funny, I.. I've made such nice little plans. Eh, care for a drink? No, thanks, I don't want a drink. Good, I'll pour it. He doesn't want a drink! Oh.. Ms. Russell, will you see if you can contact Miss Alison Kirbe at the Amadon Hotel and ask her to come down here as soon as she can? I'm Alison Kirbe. Mr. Kinston is expecting you, Ms. Kirbe. He'll be free in a few minutes. Matthew, I don't understand. Borrowed this from police procedure. I'll get a confession from that girl. Why do you need it? Telegram told everything. - 'How's that?' - Uncomfortable. [tapping] And stop that pencil tapping! - Get on your nerves? - 'Yes.' - It's supposed to. - Well, it does. [telephone buzzing] Hello? Yes, show Miss Kirbe in, please. You're, uh, sure you want to handle this yourself? Quite sure. Now, if you'll excuse me. - Oh, good afternoon. - Oh, good.. I'm very sorry to have to have you come down here like this. But I was tied up, and couldn't get away. Oh, darling, I wanted to see where you work. Yeah. Well, uh, why don't you, you sit down and, and, uh.. I've got some papers you gotta come look at. Alright. 'Uh, not there!' Over there. Where I can look at you. I'll look at these papers, it'll only take me a couple of minutes. I'm perfectly happy here. [tapping] [instrumental music] Oh, darling, I thought you wouldn't know. You're such an awful girl. And you're such a dreadful fellow. You're a captivating, entrancing heavenly little grifter. Darling. - Matt. - Hmm? - What is a grifter? - Pretty smooth. - What? - Pretty smooth. You're using that vicious term again, why? Come on, I know all about it. You know all about what? You, Terry, Thirty Mile Ranch, the whole swindle. - Swindle? - Yeah, it's an American word-- Well, it's an English word meaning exactly the same thing. Really? Is this true? Oh, come now, you can do better than that. Will you kindly tell me what you're talking about and stop that childish leering and smirking? - Leering and smirking? - Yes, leering and smirking. I'll tell you what I'm talking about. Your great Thirty Mile Ranch isn't worth a plugged nickel. But Terry lives-- And as for your good friend, Terry I had him looked up. Before he started traveling, he was known around town as "Return to the maker" Keath. - "Return to the maker?" - Yes. It's a bank notation on a bad check. Oh, no. I suppose this comes as a complete surprise to you? Yes, it does. I still can't quite understand. Oh, perfect. Would you mind saying that again? Not at all. I still can't quite understand. Magnificent. A little too much for such a badly made up story but very smooth. You realize how horrid you're being? Completely. Well, possibly this will sound like a badly made up story too. You see, there was a soldier, an older man who became friends with an English girl during the war. He wanted to give her something. He wasn't very rich, so he left her his house and his ranch. Perhaps, it was worthless as far as money goes but it was all he owned. Very interesting. Please go on. When you give someone a present, you want it to look attractive. You wrap it in gay paper, and tie it with a colored ribbon. And that's what he tried to do. You may be an excellent lawyer, but you don't understand about wrapping a will in gay paper and tying it with a colored ribbon. Do you? [instrumental music] [dramatic music] Oh, Vincent, Listen, we got no time to be standin' around saying each other names. I got important news to tell you. Then suppose you tell it-- I didn't know how to get it across to you. Just take a deep breath and begin. We don't speak the same kinda talk. - Try. - Okay. Well, I zip-lined over here from the airport. Look, Miss Kirbe I just journeyed back from visiting your ranch. And an unforeseen development has developed which might seriously distress things. It seems that your ranch is a.. - Well, it's a-- - A washout. Yeah! Now, since it's been "Lucky" Reilly who's been puttin' up the.. Advancing the funds for your living cost the new development in the situation is that the-- - The heat's on. - Right. Now, it was Terry who initiated the negotiations with Reilly. And when Reilly finds out that he's been-- - Given a fast shuffle. - Right. - Then poor Terry will be-- - Rubbed out. Yeah. You know, I never tried to sing this kinda talkin' before. - I'm not bad at it, am I? - You're on the ball. Say, you know American too, how come? -C'est la guerre. -It certainly is. Well, what are we gonna do to get poor Terry out of this jam? I don't think Terry is exactly my responsibility. - Do you? - No. No, no, I guess you're right. - Poor Terry. - He planned to swindle me. That he did. It's not my affairs he's helpless. - He was born helpless. - Oh, can't deny that. What if Reilly is a violent man? He knew that long before he ever started with him. Sure, he did. Ought to start to think for himself sometime, hasn't he? You're absolutely right. Poor Terry. Well, if all that's true, what are you doing just sitting there? Call him and get him down here. Alright. Mr. Terence Keath, please. Hello? Just a minute, now, see.. Yes, birdbrain, this is Terry. Who did you think it was? How is everything, Vincent? What? What! It can't be! Are you sure you saw the right place? I don't understand. Describe it again. Why, Vincent, you're crying! We're in pretty deep, huh? Almost $6000. Six thousand clams? You know, we were so busy figurin' out how to get your money away from you we never bothered to figure out if you had any. I must say, you and Terry are rather inefficient blaggards. Anybody would've fallen for it. Why? Don't you know nothin' about how a con game works? - No. - Any child could tell you. A con game is like a dipsy-do. And now you see it, now you don't. When you're workin' a con, you get people thinkin' of one thing then you do another. - You do? - I don't. - I'm not pretty enough. You do. - I do what? And now you see it, now you don't. [doorbell buzzing] Keep calm. Relax. The situation looks bad, but it can be handled. I-In fact, I've already taken care of everything. - What did you do? - I packed. Oh, great. The three of us will take the afternoon train for Boston. But when Reilly finds out that I'm not-- - We'll be in Boston. - Look, Terry.. Lucky Reilly will know where you are in 48 hours. They won't allow him to shoot me in Boston. Terry, sit down. I've got to think. Why couldn't we-- You better let her handle it, kid. Must be somewhere we can make some money quickly. You might as well save yourself some time. We gotta make a pile of dough in a hurry. And there's no honest way of doin' that. Mm.. - That's a good imitation. - What? - A rug. - The rug? The good imitation prayer rug. If we're so desperate, we're gonna start praying let's stick to our own side of the fence. How 'bout tryin' a gimmick with young Taylor? - He's still believes in you. - Let's sell him the ranch. No, I feel there's something a trifle unlucky about that ranch. You're right. How about trying the old Bunco game?. My dear Vincent, if I think of a way I may become a thief, but I most certainly am not going to become an old-fashioned thief. Well, we gotta do something. Mm-hmm. All I have to offer is that I look honest. - That's good. - No, it's bad. But now, that I study it you have a wonderfully thieving air. - I, a thieving air? - Congratulations. Oh, it's nothing. You said, if people are sure you're doing one thing they won't notice that you might actually be doing another. - Eh? - Now you see it, now you don't. Oh, yeah! Have you of Reilly's money left? - Yeah, about 1500. - Good. We're going to use some of it for a very worthy cause. - I don't understand. - Neither do I. But if she's got an idea, it's our only chance. I think you'll do better if you don't quite know what it is. Oh, Alison. Oh, hello, where have you been? I missed you the last few days. - Why didn't you call? - Well, I-I-- There's no need for us to break off socially just because you found out I'm dishonest. - Please, don't talk like that. - Destroying your illusions? Look, I may sound like a sap saying this but even at the risk of being trite why don't you give up this life? - You mean go straight? - That's exactly what I mean. Well, haven't you forgotten something? Shouldn't you offer me the love of a pure man? You know, the more you talk, the more you prove my point. Believe me, if you were a thief.. If you were a thief, you wouldn't y-you wouldn't talk like that. Oh, as the sergeant I knew once remarked, "Bravo." Oh, let's skip the cynicism, huh? Aren't you forgetting your duty to a client? Look, I'm not interested in any clients. All I want.. - Look, Alison-- - Excuse me, please. Oh. Ah! Alison, all I know is I can't help loving you. Even if you are a little crook. Oh, I see. Alison, I-I want you to marry me. I beg your pardon. [laughing] Look.. W-well, what do you say? You're not only convinced I'm a thief but you found out a way to reform me. Are you afraid, I might have plans against your pet client, Jeremy? - No. - Well, I do. You.. But, Alison.. [instrumental music] I wasn't kidding, these are facts. Well, I guess this proves she isn't what she seems to be, alright. Well, you're finally getting some sense. Ah, it's plain enough, they're after my money. As your lawyer, I hated having to tell you all this. But I'm glad, you see the point. Boy, I can hardly wait for the outrage to begin. What did you say? The most beautiful girl I have ever seen in my life and she is going to swindle little old me. Look, Jeremy, she's after your money. That's right. Take my money, take me. Do you realize you're talking about buying a wife? And there are very few others who are equipped to do it, old boy. Look at it this way. When did the fish ever get to enjoy the bait? They'll sell you a gold brick and leave town. - Leave town without me? - Yes. - Oh, they can't. - Oh, but they will. Oh, old pal, don't let them. I don't mind their chipping me but I've gotta wind up with a girl. Not a chance. Oh, you're kidding, aren't you? Go ahead, tell me you're kidding. I've never been more serious in my life. Then start an action against them. On what grounds? On the grounds that they're jipping me and I'm not getting the girl, I'll sue. Whoa, now, wait a minute, wait a minute. You just sit tight. Let them make the first move. Then when they play their card, we find out what the deal is. That's right. Find out what the deal is. And then sue! Remember, you don't do anything without me. Hmm. [instrumental music] Don't let him know which one you really want or he'll put the price up. - How much is this one? - I don't remember. You don't remember? My dear friend, why should I waste my time bargaining with you for 15 minutes on that rug when it's this one you want all the time. - Wise guy. - Of course. Alright, we'll take that one. Call Terry and get him started for Jeremy's. Now, I want him out of the house when we bring this in. Oh, we can make it a secret surprise, huh? - Exactly. - Oh, sure. Just like Christmas Eve. Hey, kiddo, uh.. Buddy, uh, where's your phone? - Hello, Jeremy. - Good evening, Terry. How are you? How'd you happen to drop in here? Well, I didn't just drop in. I came by on purpose. - Know what, have a cue. - Uh, no, thanks. Uh, Jeremy, Alison is in trouble. - Oh, what kind of trouble. - Money. I, uh, I-I wish I could help, but, uh.. At the moment, I'm a little overextended. Of course, you know the difficulties everyone is having in these days of currency regulation. - Mm, like what? - Oh, just, uh, difficulties. - Oh, difficulty? - Yes. - That's too bad. - Yes. Uh, I wonder, have you ever noticed that beautiful little oriental rug in the foyer of Alison's apartment? - Uh, coming to think of it.. - Yes. - Now, that you mention it.. - Yes. I never have. - Well, there is one. - I'll take your word for it. As a matter of fact, it's, uh, an extremely valuable one. - Mm, indeed. - Oh, yes. It's a genuine Persian prayer rug. Oh, it's been in her family for years. I never knew she was Persian. Uh, Persia is where the prayer rugs are made. Oh. Uh, I believe it was her uncle that was stationed in the near east and he brought it back with him. - The rug? - Yes, of course. - What did you think? - The rug. Uh, now, you see, the trouble is that, uh now, Alison has to sell her rug. - Oh, no. - Yes. Oh, that's terrible. Why, I can't let that shy little thing go hawking a rug around. I'll buy it myself. Oh, good, Jeremy, I thought you'd take it this way. Yes, and you go and tell her that I'll be down to see her first thing in the morning. Good. Uh, well, I better be getting along break the good news, you know? - 'Yes, you do that.' - Goodnight. (Jeremy) 'Goodnight.' Crooks, robbers, thieves, so forth. What are you so heated up about? Listen, I own stock in this hotel. - Yes, I know that. - A, I don't get the girl. B, they try to jip me C, they bring me down here to sell me my own rug. Look, will you relax and let me handle it? [doorbell buzzing] - Good morning, Jeremy. - Good morning. I see you've come well protected. I just happened to run into him on the corner. Should we get the business out of the way first? By all means. - This is the rug? - Yes. I see. Now, let me get this straight. Do you represent this to be a genuine Persian prayer rug? - I represent it to be-- - No. She doesn't know anything about it. I'm the expert, and I guarantee it's genuine. It's mine, of course, and it is genuine. - And it is your property? - No, it's mine. She doesn't know anything about it. - 'It's my property.' - How much? $8000. Okay. Since you seem to be above bargaining you can make the check out for 6000. Thank you. If you'll sign the bill of sale, please. - Mm-hm. - Oh, Alison, don't sign it. - Terry. - Yeah, but you better let me-- (Alison) 'Terry, please sit down.' - Thank you. - Thank you. - What are you doing? - I'm calling the police. We are charging this bunch with fraud and larceny. We are not. Whose lawyer are you anyway? You make that call and you're on your own. Why don't you let him go ahead? For the simple reason that no matter what else you are I think you're smarter than this. What else am I? Well, now, I'm not sure. You refuse to answer on advice of council. Vincent? In my bedroom cupboard, you will find a rolled up rug. - Bring it here, please. - Sure. Be my lawyer again, will you? Something is going on, and I don't get it. I don't think it's a question of getting it. I've got a strong hunch you've had it. Unroll it, Vincent. - That is hotel property. - So? The rug you just bought is a genuine prayer rug. 'Mine to sell, I bought it yesterday.' Then it's a legitimate deal. The only point is that even a genuine Persian prayer rug isn't worth more than $500. Certainly not 6000. You've just been let off on an open and shut case for false arrest. And you just lost yourself some business. Oh, what do you know? A legitimate deal. Yes, but not a very nice one. I'm sorry, Terry, but I just can't go through with this. Wait a minute, now he was perfectly willing to put us in jail. Eager, in fact. Alison! If I had a rope, I'd cut my throat. - You mean a knife. - No, I don't. The way things have been going around here you could hang yourself with a knife. Alison! Alison, wait a minute. Where are you going? I'm going to see Mr. Reilly, and tell him the truth. Oh, please, take my word for it. I can handle him, but if you got out there, he.. Well, he might have you taken for a ride. If Mr. Reilly invites me to drive with him I shall simply decline to go. Club Mentone, 44 River H Drive. Alison, you can't go out there by yourself. It's silly. - Where'd she go? Reilly's? - Out to Reilly's. Yeah, there's no use trying to head her off. I guess we've done everything we can do. You can't stop a headstrong woman. Well, so long, fellas. - Ah.. - But.. All we can do is hope for the best. Yeah. - Well, so long. - So long. Can't you go any faster, please? Lady, I got two tickets last week, another one and they'll take my license away. I'm sorry. Table 8, win 715. Table 9, lose 300. Table 10, win 825. Table 11, win 640. Table 11 won 850 bucks last night, not 640. That's all Martin turned in. Pass that onto Martin, and get the other 210. Oh, uh, Miss Kirbe. Come in and close the door. I didn't see you there. I beg your pardon. Mine? Beg his. I'm sorry. What brings you here at this hour? Mr. Reilly, I haven't any money. Oh, I'm sure Mr. Keath will let you have anything you need. No, you don't understand. I'm talking about my estate. It's as good as non-existent. It's worthless. Go on. Don't you wanna sit down? No, I don't. Terry and I owe you $6000. Here is a 1000 of it. We'll also let you have a rug worth $500 and a coat worth 2500. A rug and a coat? As soon as we can get jobs, I think I can promise you payments of at least $10 a week on the balance. Ten bucks, and all for me? I think that covers everything. Now, you've had your say and you're just gonna walk out, is that it? Yes. And since you don't frighten me I suggest you save time by not trying. I think you're a very nasty little man of an extremely unsavory type. And I don't want to spend more time talking to you than I have to. Well, that's a little rough, isn't it, Miss Kirbe? I want you to understand this. If you attempt to bother either Terry or myself I shall go straight to the authorities. - Is that clear? - I guess it's clear. Good. We'll send you the payments as soon as we get jobs. [growling] Boo! Okay, Terry. Well, you decided to be sensible, huh? - Yup. - And you're lucky. I wasn't fooling, Reilly. If you'd gotten tough with that girl I would've blown the top of your head off. I guess that's why I never keep a loaded gun in my desk. You keep a.. [gasping] - Well, anyway.. - Sure, sure. Send him in. - You here? - Yeah. - Did you do what I said? - Yup. Remember, if you get one step out of line with this girl I'm gonna personally see that you're turned over to the district attorney. - You don't say. - I do say. Well, I've got a cousin, she's married. Who did she marry? The district attorney. Wha.. Why'd she do what I told you for? Just did it. [knock on door] You here? Reilly, I wanna talk to you. - Did you do what I told you? - Yeah. Good. Well, gentlemen, I guess that takes care of everything. Now, listen, Reilly. - I wanna talk to you. - Oh? Oh! No! A man could get killed in here. [indistinct chatter] [doorbell buzzing] [instrumental music] Is that all in? Announce us. Hey, Miss Kirbe, they're back. Gentlemen, I think you'll be glad to know that everything has been settled with Mr. Reilly. - It has? - Yes. All you have to do is take a firm hand with people like that. You'll, uh, be leaving then, huh? Yes, there's nothing left for me here and I can send Mr. Reilly his payments from England. Alison. Uh, look, I don't suppose you two would leave me alone with her, would you? You're so right. Look, Alison, I started this out on one basis. I was in a tough spot and I needed money. But now it's turned into something else. I'm in love with you. Now, if that means anything to you, I'll get a job-- It's very sweet of you, Terry. And I know, you mean it. Now, wait just a minute. If we're starting to make public proposals, what about me? I want you to marry me, so you can help me spend my money. It's very sweet of you, Jeremy. Well, with me, you can have everything your own way. And with me, you can have anything and everything you ever wanted. I won't bid for you, I won't offer you money and I won't let you be boss. - Well? - Well? - No. - Well, what are you gonna be? An old maid? One'll get you ten if I am. [instrumental music] I told you. He never had a chance. (Jeremy) 'Let's go. I know a couple of girls.' 'One of 'em is rich, and the other one's beautiful.' 'I'll take the rich one..'
