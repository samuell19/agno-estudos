IM SORRY. BUT MUM SAID... IM SORRY. IM PROUD TO SAY PETER WAS A FRIEND OF MINE. HE WAS A WELL-LOVED MEMBER OF THIS CHURCH, A CARING HUSBAND AND FATHER, A TALENTED TEACHER, A GIFTED LAY PREACHER. HE WAS... IM A PSYCHIATRIST AND WHEN PETER FIRST TOLD ME ABOUT CHRISTIANITY I SAW NO NEED FOR GOD. BUT HIS LOVE WAS SO PERSISTENT, HIS ACTIONS ALWAYS POINTED ME TO JESUS. I... THANK YOU MY BROTHER, OH, IM GOING TO MISS YOU. TODAY, WE MARK THE END OF PETER'S JOURNEY ON THIS EARTH. BUT WE ALSO COMMEND HIM TO THE LOVE OF CHRIST BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT, RIGHT NOW, HE IS ALIVE AND WITH GOD IN HEAVEN. ABSOLUTE RUBBISH. BECAUSE PETER, WAS A SAVED MAN. MUM, WHERE ARE PAUL AND JAMES? I DON'T KNOW DARLING. MARY, IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN EVER DO FOR YOU PLEASE, YOU JUST LET ME KNOW, OK? IM GOING TO MISS THAT MAN. YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD JAMES THE TRUTH. I KNOW.

FUNERALS AREN'T THE PLACE FOR CHILDREN. WHAT ABOUT A CHANCE TO SAY GOODBYE? SHOULDN'T PUT THEM THROUGH IT. THAT'S WHY THE BOYS AREN'T HERE. IT COULD DAMAGE THEM. ESPECIALLY HAVING TO LISTEN TO ALL THAT. SORRY? THAT NONSENSE THE VICAR WAS SPOUTING. I DON'T THINK NOW'S THE TIME. WELL IT DOES MAKE ME ANGRY. FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON, PETER WENT ALL RELIGIOUS. EVERYBODY'S VERY UPSET. YES, WELL DRAGGING US TO THAT CHURCH DIDN'T REALLY HELP. WHY COULD YOU NEVER RESPECT HIS BELIEFS? WE HAVE OUR OWN OPINION ABOUT THE MEANING OF LIFE. YOU BELIEVE WHAT YOU LIKE. PETER WAS YOUR SON. AND WHAT GOOD CAME OF ALL THAT FAITH? YOU TELL ME THAT. I WISH I WENT TO THE FUNERAL. WHY? I WANTED TO SAY GOODBYE. YOU'D HAVE GOT BORED AND THEN BEEN UPSET. NO I WOULDN'T. OF COURSE YOU WOULD. GRANDAD SAID, YOU'RE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO COPE. I AM. HE SAID PEOPLE NEED TO LEARN TO COPE AND LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES. WE'RE ON OUR OWN NOW. HELLO, BOYS.

PAUL AND JAMES WALKER WERE RECEIVED INTO CARE IN JANUARY. THEIR FATHER DIED IN A MOTOR ACCIDENT IN DECEMBER AND THEIR MOTHER SUFFERED A RECURRENCE OF DEPRESSIVE ILLNESS. ER, SHE TOOK AN OVERDOSE WHICH LEAD TO THE BOYS RECEPTION INTO CARE. AND WHY SEND THEM TO A CHURCH CHILDREN'S HOME? MINIMUM DISRUPTION. THE BOYS ARE TOGETHER, THEY CAN STAY AT THE SAME SCHOOL AND THERE'S CONTINUED CONTACT WITH ELTON CHURCH. AND HOW'S THE MOTHER? STILL UNSTABLE AND CAN'T REALLY COPE. WHAT ABOUT RELATIVES? THERE'S BEEN AN OFFER FROM THE GRANDPARENTS. MARGARET AND EDWARD WALKER. WELL, THERE YOU GO THEN. MARY'S A CHRISTIAN. THE IN-LAWS ARE ATHEISTS! DOES IT MATTER? WELL, IT WOULD GO AGAINST HER WILL. AND HER FAITH HAS TO BE RESPECTED. IF POSSIBLE, YES. WELL, CLEARLY IT'S NOT POSSIBLE. SEND THE BOYS TO THEIR RELATIVES. WELL, MARY MIGHT GET BETTER. I MEAN, PERHAPS, WITH A LOT OF SUPPORT WE COULD PLAN A RETURN HOME. WE COULD OFFER HER HOME HELP, DAY CARE DURING THE HOLIDAYS... STRAWS? CLUTCHING? KEEP ME POSTED. HAVE YOU STOLEN THINGS BEFORE?

MARY. THE COUNTY COUNCIL WILL LOOK AFTER YOUR CHILDREN, BUT IVE BEEN TOLD THEY CAN'T STAY HERE MUCH LONGER. WHY? WELL, THIS IS A CHURCH RUN CHILDREN'S HOME. IT COSTS THE COUNCIL TOO MUCH MONEY. I CAN'T TAKE THEM BACK YET, JOHN. I CAN'T, IM NOT READY, I CAN'T. I KNOW. OBVIOUSLY WE'D MUCH PREFER IT IF THEY WERE WITH YOU. BUT YOUR IN-LAWS HAVE SAID THEY'RE WILLING TO HELP. WHAT DO YOU THINK? NO. WHY? THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD. RIGHT. PETER'S PARENTS HATED EVERYTHING HE STOOD FOR. IM SURE THEY'D BE RESPECTFUL OF THE BOYS' BELIEFS. THEY WEREN'T RESPECTFUL OF THEIR FATHER'S. AT LEAST THEY'RE FAMILY. NO. I WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU AND FOR THE BOYS. LETS TAKE IT ONE STEP AT A TIME. JOHN, I DO TRUST YOU. MUM? YEAH? IVE GOT THIS TOY AND I WANT TO KEEP IT SAFE. WILL YOU LOOK AFTER IT FOR ME? DON'T YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH IT HERE? NO I WANT YOU TO KEEP IT FOR ME. ALRIGHT. WHY AREN'T WE GOING HOME? I CAN'T. WHY? IM SORRY, I CAN'T. WHY AREN'T WE GOING HOME?

RIGHT, STRAIGHT TO THE POINT. WE WANT THE BOYS OUT OF HERE. THEY MUST COME AND LIVE WITH US. MARY IS CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR VIEWS ON FAITH. THE BOYS CAN MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS. I WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR THIS WHOLE FAMILY. BUT I HAVE TO CONSIDER MARY'S BELIEFS. SHE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. I HOPE YOU'LL THINK OF THAT TOO WHEN YOU CONSIDER HER BELIEFS. I WROTE DAD A LETTER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I WROTE HIM A LETTER, SAYING I LOVE HIM AND I MISS HIM. WHY DID YOU DO THAT? I THOUGHT THAT IF I THREW IT UP INTO THE CLOUDS, GOD MIGHT CATCH IT AND GIVE IT TO HIM. STUPID. IM NOT STUPID. I JUST WANT TO BE GOOD. FOR DAD. HEY! THE 13 YEAR OLD WAS RESIDENT AT HIGHFIELD NATIONAL CHILDREN'S HOME, AND SHE WAS FOUND HANGING FROM A TREE THIS MORNING. THE DEATH IS NOT BEING TREATED AS SUSPICIOUS, BUT IT HAS RAISED QUESTIONS, ONCE AGAIN, OVER THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CHURCH RUN CHILDREN'S HOMES. AND WE BESEECH THEE, THAT WE, WITH ALL THOSE WHO ARE DEPARTED IN THE TRUE FAITH... WHEN YOU DIE, WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO YOU? I DON'T KNOW. IS CAROL IN HEAVEN? IM SURE SHE IS. SHE COMMITTED SUICIDE, EVERYONE KNOWS SHE CAN'T GO TO HEAVEN. DON'T BE SO SILLY, PAUL. DO YOU RECKON SHE'LL MEET MY DADDY? PERHAPS. I DON'T WANT TO DIE. SHH. YOUR CHILDREN AREN'T IN DANGER. I THOUGHT THEY WERE SAFE. THEY ARE, ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, JAMES HAS HAD A FEW NIGHTMARES BUT THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED. PAUL SEEMS UNAFFECTED. IM REALLY WORRIED, JOHN. WE WON'T GET THEM INTO ANOTHER CHILDREN'S HOME. AND IT'S UNLIKELY WE'LL FIND FOSTER PARENTS. DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT, JOHN, THEY AREN'T GOING TO LIVE WITH MY IN-LAWS. WE BELIEVE COMPLETELY OPPOSITE THINGS. IM UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE HERE. FROM ALL SIDES. IM SORRY, I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. I'LL TAKE THEM BACK. MARY. I'LL TAKE THEM BACK. I CAN DO THAT CAN'T I? TECHNICALLY, AT THE MOMENT, YES. I MEAN, THEY'RE UNDER A SECTION ONE BUT... I'LL WORK HARD AND I'LL MAKE THINGS RIGHT. I WANT THEM HOME. WE'RE GOING HOME. MUM'S BETTER. I HEARD AGES AGO.

HE REALLY LIKES YOU. NO, DON'T BE SILLY. ARRRRRGH! BOYS? CUP OF TEA? YEAH, THANKS. ARE YOU GOING TO GET MARRIED, MUM? NO, NO... DON'T BE SILLY, HE'S JUST A FRIEND. THAT'S ALL. HI, JOHN... I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU. I KNOW, I JUST THOUGHT ID POP ROUND TO SEE HOW YOU'RE GETTING ON. IM GOOD, IM GOOD, YEAH. GOOD... HOW ARE THE BOYS? GREAT. GIVING ME THE RUN AROUND, BUT YOU KNOW... I JUST WAS THINKING, IF YOU WANTED ME TO... MARY, WHERE'S THE CORKSCREW? IM SORRY, I HAD NO IDEA YOU HAD COMPANY, I WOULD NEVER HAVE... IT'S FINE, HE'S JUST A FRIEND... FINE. GREAT. WELL, I'LL ER... DISAPPEAR AND LEAVE YOU TO IT. THANKS JOHN, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. MARY? YOU'D BETTER GO. YES. IM GOING OUT, MUM. I WANT YOU BACK BY NINE. BYE, MUM. I BET YOU HE'S LATE. GO EASY ON HIM, GEORGE. I TRUST HIM. ARE YOU GOING TO BE OK MUM? ERM, JAMES! THAT'S NOT A POLITE QUESTION TO ASK. NO, IT'S ALRIGHT. THINGS ARE BETTER NOW AREN'T THEY? IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHURCH OFTEN. WELL, PERHAPS WE COULD GO ON SUNDAY. DO YOU STILL LOVE DAD? YES. WHAT WAS THE LAST THING YOU SAID TO HIM? I CAN'T REMEMBER. I WISH I COULD. I SAID I WANTED TO BE A CHRISTIAN, THEN I PRAYED WITH HIM. IM TRYING HARD TO BE GOOD BUT IM JUST TOO SCARED IF I DIE. I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST ENJOY LIFE WHILE YOU'RE YOUNG. BEING A CHRISTIAN ISN'T ABOUT BEING GOOD. IT'S ABOUT TRUSTING JESUS. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF DO YOU GO TO HEAVEN? WHAT? JAMES! THAT IS NOT A QUESTION TO ASK! IT'S NOT THE TIME AND IT'S NOT THE PLACE. YOU DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS LIKE THAT! GEORGE! BUT MARY, HE NEEDS... GEORGE, BUT MARY... NO! I THINK IT'S TIME YOU LEFT. MARY? NO, PLEASE, JUST GO. IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? OUT. I TOLD YOU TO BE BACK BY NINE. SO.

WHAT'S GOING ON? IT'S GOING TO BE FINE. IM JUST GOING TO HAVE A QUICK CHAT WITH JOYCE ALRIGHT? THANK YOU FOR THIS, JOYCE. IT'S OK. HOW IS SHE? NOT GREAT. I THINK SHE'S JUST VERY TIRED. ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT ME TO TAKE PAUL AS WELL? THE CHURCH ARE BUSY ORGANISING ANOTHER CARER. YOU'D BE VERY WELCOME TO COME WITH US PAUL. I'LL BE FINE. HEATHER WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU... I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL IN THE MORNING. THIS CASE HAS BEEN A COMPLETE SHAMBLES. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU CONVINCED ME TO MOVE THE BOYS FROM THE HOME BACK TO THEIR MOTHER. I THOUGHT SHE'D COPE. YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THAT WOMAN FOR TOO LONG, JOHN. "THAT WOMAN" HAS RIGHTS. AND SO DO SOCIAL SERVICES. SHE'S GETTING BETTER, STRONGER EVERY TIME I SEE HER. SHE'S GOT HYSTERICAL PSYCHOSIS. I THINK THAT'S A MISDIAGNOSIS. SHE'S NOT HISTRIONIC. SHE'S DEPRESSED. A DEPENDENT PERSONALITY DEFINITELY. OH YES? AND WHO DIED AND MADE YOU PSYCHIATRIST? IVE SEEN IT BEFORE. SHE NEEDS TO BE ENCOURAGED TO STAND UP FOR HERSELF. LOOK, LT CLEARLY STATES HERE THAT SHE IS INCURABLE. "THERE IS NOTHING MORE THAT CAN BE DONE FOR HER." AND IT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF EVERYONE "IF HER BOYS WERE TAKEN AWAY FROM HER." CLEARLY SIGNED BY HER GP. I AGREE SHE'S FRAGILE BUT LOOK AT HER CASE HISTORY. SHE SUFFERED FROM DEPRESSION AFTER THE BIRTH OF HER TWO KIDS. THEN TO CAP IT ALL HER HUSBAND DIES. REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE, MARY IS INCAPABLE OF LOOKING AFTER HER CHILDREN. SHE'S A GOOD MOTHER. LOOK, STOP WASTING YOUR TIME AND GET THOSE BOYS IN A SECURE ENVIRONMENT. I THINK YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE. AND I THINK YOU'RE TOO INVOLVED. YOUR PROFESSIONALISM IS RIGHT ON THE LINE HERE, JOHN. IM GONNA TELL MUM YOU STOLE THE CAR FROM MARTIN. NO I DIDN'T. GIVE IT BACK. LADS, STOP TEASING. JAMES! MUM! PAUL! PAUL, LEAVE JAMES ALONE. STOP TEASING EACH OTHER! MUM! JAMES! PAUL! PAUL, STOP IT! MUM! PAUL, JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE! MUM? MUM? MUM? HAVE YOU SEEN MUM? YEAH, SHE'S IN THE KITCHEN. NO SHE'S NOT. I CHECKED. MUM? MUM. MUM? MUM? MUM? MUM? HELLO, JOHN? IT'S PAUL WALKER HERE... IT'S MUM, WE CAN'T FIND HER... I THINK SHE'S... I DON'T KNOW... WE LOOKED ALL OVER THE HOUSE... LN ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES? YES, WE'LL WAIT FOR YOU... NO, JAMES WILL BE FINE... I UPSET MUM AND I LIED TO HER. IVE MADE HER LIKE THIS. IM SURE YOU HAVEN'T. DO YOU THINK THINGS WILL BE OK? HAVE FAITH, JAMES. YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW, MARY. YOU DISAPPEARED. I WAS IN THE BATHROOM. BUT THE BOYS WERE CALLING YOU. I DIDN'T HEAR THEM. IT'S NOT FAIR ON THEM. YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT MY CHILDREN. THAT'S NOT TRUE. I DON'T WANT THEM TO GO TO MY IN-LAWS. LISTEN, MARY. YOUR GP HAS SAID THAT YOUR CONDITION CAN'T BE CURED. THAT YOU'LL NEVER CARE FOR YOUR BOYS AGAIN. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? IT'S NOT UP TO ME. JOHN, PLEASE. SORRY, MARY, THE DECISION'S BEEN MADE. PLEASE. LISTEN BOYS YOU UNDERSTAND THIS IS FOR THE BEST? YOUR MUM ISN'T WELL AT ALL. BUT THEY LIVE MILES AWAY, WE'LL NEVER SEE HER. IT WON'T BE AS BAD AS YOU THINK. HOW LONG ARE WE GOING FOR? THIS IS A LONG TERM ARRANGEMENT. BUT WHAT IF MUM GETS BETTER? IM SORRY, JAMES, BUT I THINK THAT'S VERY UNLIKELY. JAMES? JAMES! JAMES! STOP!

JAMES, WHEN YOU'RE DEAD YOU'RE DEAD. THAT'S IT. OVER. I BELIEVE IN GOD. WELL OF COURSE ITS FINE IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THAT. IF YOU WANT YOU COULD EVEN GO TO CHURCH. I DONT THINK I WANT TO GO BY MYSELF. I'M JUST ASKING IF YOU THINK GOD IS REAL? NO. JAMES, I DON'T. SO WHY ARE WE CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS? WHAT? WHAT IS CHRISTMAS FOR? WELL, IT'S FOR THE FAMILY. LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU GO AND PLAY WITH PAUL? YOU'VE HARDLY TALKED TO HIM ALL DAY. NOW IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE US TO PRAY ABOUT? ERM. YES PLEASE. CAN WE PRAY FOR THE WALKER FAMILY?

DEAR LORD, WE PRAY, LORD, THAT HOWEVER DARK THE WALKER'S LIVES MAY SEEM RIGHT NOW THAT, THAT THEY WOULD GROW TO LOVE YOU AND SEE THE GOOD THAT YOUR LOVE CAN BRING THEM. THAT, RIGHT NOW, YOU WOULD WORK IN THEIR LIVES, FOR YOUR GLORY, FOR SOMETHING WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL. WE PRAY THESE PRECIOUS NAME OF JESUS. AMEN. AMEN. HELLO SIR, HELLO. HOW'S THE JOURNEY? I'LL TAKE THEM FOR YOU. ALL YOU EVER TALK ABOUT IS GOD. IT'S IMPORTANT. NO, IT'S NOT. IT'S WHAT DAD BELIEVED. SO. LT DOESN'T MAKE IT TRUE. GOD'S NOT REAL. YOU KNOW WHY MUM CAN'T LOOK AFTER US, DON'T YOU? SHE'S POORLY AND SHE NEEDS TO GET BETTER. NO, BECAUSE SHE'S MAD AND SHE KEEPS TRYING TO KILL HERSELF, THAT'S NOT TRUE. YES, IT IS.

YOU KNOW, HER WAY OF MAKING PEOPLE LISTEN. NO ONE LOVES US ANYMORE. WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET TO SEE MUM? WELL, PERHAPS WE CAN ORGANISE A VISIT. BEING A CHRISTIAN IS NOT JUST BASED ON GOING TO CHURCH PRAYING OR EVEN DOING GOOD WORKS. OF COURSE, ALL THESE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT IN THEIR OWN RIGHT. BUT THEY NEED TO COME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF A TRANSFORMED LIFE. A LIFE TRANSFORMED BY JESUS CHRIST. WHO EVEN GIVES US THE FAITH TO BELIEVE AND TRUST IN HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHEN WE ARE IN TROUBLE, WHEN WE ARE IN DISTRESS WE NEED TO RUN TO HIM AND CLING TO HIM. WE CAN TRUST JESUS. HE ALONE IS ALL POWERFUL. ALL SEEING. ALL KNOWING. HE IS THE ROCK OF OUR SALVATION.

YOU SEE JOHN, THE PROBLEM IS IF THEY'RE BEHAVING LIKE THIS IN HIGH SEASON. MARGARET IS VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE GUESTS. WELL, IM SURE GIVEN TIME THEY WILL SETTLE IN. PAUL CAN BE SO SULLEN. SOMETIMES I DON'T REALLY LIKE HIM, THAT'S PERFECTLY NATURAL. HAVE YOU TRIED SHOWING THE BOYS SOME AFFECTION. YES, I TAKE THEM OUT. I PLAY WITH THEM. DO YOU OFFER THEM ANY, YOU KNOW, PHYSICAL CONTACT? LOOK HERE, WE ARE DOING OUR BEST. IT'S NOT BEEN EASY. IT'S BEEN STRESSFUL, IT'S BEEN VERY STRESSFUL. DARLING, IT'S ALRIGHT, IT'S ALRIGHT. YOU SEE JOHN, THE FACT IS, I JUST DONT KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER WE CAN CARRY ON. RIGHT. YOU DO KNOW I CAN AFFORD A PRIVATE DOCTOR. IT'S ALL BEEN TAKEN CARE OF. CONSIDER IT A GIFT TO YOUR FAMILY. THANK YOU. YOU'RE VERY KIND. I REQUESTED A TRANSFER OVER OF YOUR MEDICAL NOTES. IT SAYS HERE THAT YOU SUFFER FROM AN INCURABLE HYSTERIA. DID ANYONE EVER EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU? DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS? NO, NOT REALLY. IT MEANS YOUR BEHAVIOUR TENDS TO BE OVER DRAMATIC AND ATTENTION SEEKING WHEN YOU ARE UNDER STRESS. LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE TAKEN AN OVERDOSE. I JUST FELT REALLY ALONE. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? GOOD. POSITIVE. IM DOING MORE. IVE GOT A LOT MORE ENERGY. RIGHT, MRS THOMAS, WOULD YOU LIKE TO FOLLOW ME THIS WAY? OH DEAR, EXCUSE ME. BE BACK IN A MINUTE. IT'S FIRST ON THE RIGHT. GET OFF ME! GET OFF! GET OFF ME! BOYS! STOP THIS, NOW STOP IT! I CAN'T COPE WITH THIS. GET THEM OUT. GO ON, GET THEM OUT. GET THEM OUT! SHH. IT'S ALRIGHT, LOVE. YOU ALRIGHT? IT'S OK. DID YOU WANT TO BE THE CENTRE OF ATTENTION? NO. WHEN PETER DIED, I JUST WANTED EVERYBODY ELSE TO TAKE CARE OF ME. MY FRIENDS, CHURCH... BUT IT JUST ALL FELL TO PIECES. YOU'RE STILL ANXIOUS THOUGH AREN'T YOU? OF COURSE I AM. IM WORRIED I WON'T GET MY BOYS BACK. WHAT'S GOING ON? IT'S BEEN DECIDED THAT IT'S BEST FOR YOU BOTH IF YOU STAY AT A NEW CHILDREN'S ASSESSMENT CENTRE IN WESTON. THEN WHAT? THEN YOU'LL BE ASSESSED. AND SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE WILL DECIDE WHERE WE... WHERE YOU GO FROM THERE. DOES THIS MEAN WE'LL BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH MUM? I DOUBT IT, JAMES. BUT YOU'LL THINK ABOUT IT? WE WERE BETTER OFF WITH MUM. EVERY OPTION WILL BE CONSIDERED AT THE ASSESSMENT CENTRE. IM SORRY BOYS. I REALLY AM VERY SORRY. WHAT DID WE DO? OH, JAMES. YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING AT ALL. NOTHING AT ALL LAD. IT'S JUST THAT, YOU KNOW, YOUR NANA CAN'T REALLY COPE YOU SEE? BUT YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, TRULY. GOODBYE, NANA. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US. MARY, WHY ARE YOU HERE? I WANT TO PROVE THAT IM BETTER. I LET MY BOYS DOWN, AND I MISS THEM. I WANT THEM HOME. I HAVE TO SAY THAT I DISAGREE WITH THIS DIAGNOSIS. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE HYSTERICAL AT ALL. YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN, LIKE PETER? YOU TRUST GOD? THAT'S WHY IM FEELING BETTER, I KNOW HE'S WITH ME. THANKS, CLEMENT. YOU'VE REALLY MADE THINGS CLEAR. YOU'VE RESCUED ME. YOU'VE RESCUED YOURSELF, MARY. WELL, ULTIMATELY, IVE GOTTA THANK GOD FOR THIS. I AGREE WITH THAT. AND, I DON'T THINK YOU NEED ME ANYMORE. NO, NO I DO. I NEED YOU TO HELP ME TO PROVE TO EVERYONE ELSE THAT IM OK. HELLO, NORTH SHORE GUEST HOUSE... OH... MARY, HELLO. NO, THE BOYS AREN'T HERE... I'LL JUST PASS YOU OVER TO EDWARD. HELLO, MARY. NO... SOCIAL SERVICES NOT BEEN IN TOUCH WITH YOU? WELL, YOU SEE, THEY'VE MOVED THE BOYS FROM HERE... YES, I HAVEN'T GOT THE NUMBER, NO... WHY DON'T YOU TRY CALLING... MARY? HELLO? MARY, HELLO? WHAT A MESS. HELLO JOHN... IT'S MARY WALKER. IT WASN'T THE INTENTION OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO KEEP YOU IN THE DARK. YOU DIDN'T EVEN ASK MY OPINION. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT YOUR OPINION DOESN'T COUNT. YOU DIDN'T EVEN CALL. WHY JOHN? IM SORRY. IM REALLY SORRY. I WANT MY BOYS BACK. WITH YOUR TRACK RECORD? IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. MY BOYS ARE IN CARE UNDER A SECTION ONE, YOU TOLD ME. IT'S MY CHOICE TO ASK FOR THEM BACK. THE BOYS' MOVE WAS A DE FACTO TRANSFER. A SOLE DECISION OF THE COUNTY COUNCIL. YOUR CHOICE WAS THEREFORE RELINQUISHED. RIGHT. BUT IM BETTER NOW. IM STRONGER. GIVE IT UP, MARY. AND ACCEPT THAT SOCIAL SERVICES WILL DO THE RIGHT THING FOR YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN. WHO'S TALKING NOW JOHN, YOU, OR SOCIAL SERVICES? I REPRESENT SOCIAL SERVICES. THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE. IT'S LIKE TRYING TO GAIN CONTROL OVER SOMETHING AND THEN REALIZING YOU DON'T HAVE TO. THE MORE I FOCUS ON THE LORD AND THE BOYS THE MORE ENERGISED I FEEL. BUT THEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS. I'LL VOUCH FOR YOU. I THINK IVE MESSED UP TOO MANY TIMES. NO... HELLO! HELLO CHRISTINA, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. HELLO, MARY, I THINK I CAN HELP. ALRIGHT LADS, JUST TAKE A SEAT HERE. RIGHT. THE MEETING WILL LAST ABOUT AN HOUR AND THEN WE'LL CALL YOU IN TO DISCUSS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU TWO OK? WE'LL BE FINE. PAUL? I WANT TO GO HOME. WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN? SHUT UP AND GROW UP. THIS IS A COMPLETE AND UTTER SHAMBLES. IT HAS BEEN VERY UNFORTUNATE. UNFORTUNATE? IT'S A DISGRACE. JOHN, PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE CURRENT POSITION IS? WE NEED TO SECURE LONG TERM CARE FOR JAMES AND PAUL WALKER. ALTHOUGH I THINK THE BOYS THEMSELVES ARE STILL HOPEFUL THEY CAN GO BACK HOME TO THEIR MOTHER. NOT A CHANCE. I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A SOLICITOR REPRESENTING THE WALKER'S. AND THE TONE OF IT WORRIES ME. ARE REPORTS WATER TIGHT ON THIS? I'LL CHECK. BEST DO CHECK - FORENSICALLY. I WANT EVERYTHING IN WRITING. THE FACT THAT SHE'S HIRED A SOLICITOR DEMONSTRATES A HUGE IMPROVEMENT IN HER HEALTH AND MOTIVATION. OH, IM GLAD YOU CAN SEE THE POSITIVE SIDE! IVE IMPLEMENTED A SECTION THREE. THEY'RE COMPLETELY UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE COUNTY COUNCIL NOW. IF GOD IS REAL THEN MAYBE HE'LL FIND A WAY TO SEND US HOME. YOU CAN COME IN NOW, JAMES. PAUL, WE'LL TALK TO YOU IN A MINUTE. GOOD MORNING, JAMES, MY NAME IS GILLIAN TUTT. AND IM THE SENIOR SOCIAL WORKER IN CHARGE OF YOUR CASE. NOW, AS YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD A MEETING THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS YOUR FUTURE. AND WE'VE REACHED A UNANIMOUS DECISION. NOW, IM SURE YOU'RE AWARE THAT YOUR MOTHER IS VERY ILL. AND IN OUR OPINION SHE'S NOT REALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AFTER YOU PROPERLY. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING YOU UP FOR LONG TERM FOSTERING. PERHAPS EVEN ADOPTION. I WANT TO GO HOME. OH, COME ON, JAMES. LET'S BE SENSIBLE. WE'RE GOING TO FIND YOU A NICE NEW FAMILY. WHAT ABOUT MY BROTHER. WILL WE BE TOGETHER? WELL, WE HAVE TO BE GROWN UP ABOUT IT AND RIGHT NOW, I THINK THAT IS VERY UNLIKELY. I DON'T THINK THIS IS WHAT GOD WANTS. OH, REALLY? I THINK, PERHAPS, YOU SHOULD CHECK WITH GOD AGAIN. THANK YOU, JAMES. WELL DONE. COME ON, PAUL. LET'S GO IN. IM NOT GOING TO LET YOU. YOU CAN'T MAKE ME. I'LL JUST RUN AWAY. AND WE'LL END UP WITH THE POLICE INVOLVED. I DON'T CARE. WELL YOU SHOULD CARE. NOW STOP BEING RUDE AND... PAUL WALKER, COME BACK HERE THIS INSTANT. WHAT'S WRONG? GO AWAY. LEAVE ME ALONE. YOU'RE MY BROTHER. WE SHOULD STICK TOGETHER. I WANT TO GO HOME. SO DO I. AND ANY COURT WOULD AGREE THAT YOU HANDED OVER YOUR CHILDREN FREELY BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T COPE. AND WHEN YOU TOOK THEM BACK AGAIN YOU FAILED IN YOUR DUTY OF CARE. I KNOW. BUT IM BETTER NOW. AND THEN THE AUTHORITIES TOOK OVER, QUITE RIGHTLY. THEY DIDN'T EVEN CONSULT ME. AND NEITHER DID THEY HAVE TO. WHOSE INTERESTS DID THEY HAVE? WELL, THE BOYS, IN THEORY. THEY DIDN'T CONSULT THE BOYS. OH COME ON, THEY MUST'VE DONE. NO, THEY TOLD THEM WHERE THEY WERE GOING AND WHAT THEY WERE DOING, BUT THEY DIDN'T CONSULT THEM. COME ON JAMES, WE'VE GOT TO GO! GET IN THE CAR NOW PLEASE! WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET TO SEE MUM? ERM, IM NOT SURE, PAUL. JAMES MISSES HER TOO. IT'S THE DOOR. LEAVE THAT DOOR ALONE. JUSTIN GET OUT OF THE WAY AND DON'T ANSWER BACK! HELLO JOHN, HOW ARE YOU? HI RUTH. MEET THE WALKER BOYS. THEY'LL BE SHARING WITH A YOUNG LAD NAMED JUSTIN. GEOFF, SWEETIE, WILL YOU GIVE US A MINUTE? OK. WE NEED TO GET MOVING ON THE FOSTER DIRECTORY, SO I'LL GET A PHOTOGRAPHER OVER SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. FINE. THE ONLY OTHER THING IS THE MOTHER'S STARTED TO MAKE NOISES ABOUT HAVING THE BOYS BACK. SO IF THEY TALK ABOUT IT, JUST GENTLY... NIP IT IN THE BUD. WILL DO. LISTEN, THESE KIDS HAVE BEEN PUSHED FROM PILLAR TO POST, THEY'RE BOTH... DON'T WORRY, I'LL BE GENTLE WITH THEM. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IM PRAYING THAT GOD WILL LET US BE A FAMILY AGAIN. WHY? WELL, IF GOD WANTS US TO BE A FAMILY AGAIN WE WILL BE. YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT? GOD WILL DO WHAT'S BEST FOR US. IT'S THE ONLY HOPE WE'VE GOT. RIGHT BOYS. WE NEED TO PUT YOUR VIDEOS IN THE FOSTER DIRECTORY. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TALK ABOUT YOURSELVES. WHAT YOU LOVE DOING, WHAT YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP, THAT SORT OF THING. BEFORE WE START PROCEEDINGS ID LIKE TO CONGRATULATE EVERYONE... GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE. IM CHRISTINA GRACE AND IM HERE TODAY AS A FORMAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WALKER FAMILY. ARE YOU? I ASSUME YOU'RE HERE AS AN OBSERVER. I MUST REMIND YOU THAT MARY WALKER HAS NO LEGAL RIGHT TO BE HEARD AT THIS COMMITTEE. AND UNDER SECTION 3 OF THE CHILD PROTECTION ACT ALL AUTHORITY OVER THE CHILDREN IS OWNED BY THE STATE. AND WHAT ABOUT THE BOYS? I BEG YOUR PARDON? WHAT ABOUT THE BOYS? WHAT ABOUT THEIR RIGHT TO BE HEARD? HAVE YOU ASKED THE CHILDREN WHAT THEY WANT? THEY HAVE AGREED TO OUR PROPOSALS AND ARE FULLY AWARE OF THEIR MOTHER'S CONDITION. BUT HAVE YOU ASKED THE BOYS WHAT THEY WANT? YOU MISS THE POINT. THEY HAVE AGREED TO OUR PROPOSALS. IF THE BOYS WANT TO LIVE WITH EACH OTHER AND THEIR MUM, AND THEIR MOTHER WANTS THEM HOME, DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO IGNORE THEM? ALL THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE BOYS ARE HAPPY WHERE THEY ARE. THAT THE MOTHER SUFFERS FROM AN INCURABLE HYSTERIA. SO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INPUT BUT WE HAVE A LONG AGENDA AND MUST MOVE ON, IM SORRY. ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENTS, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR RESPONSE. WE WILL BE IN TOUCH AFTER THE MEETING. CAN I LEAVE THIS WITH YOU? WHAT IS IT? IT'S FROM MARY'S PSYCHIATRIST, HE'S GIVEN HER A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH. GOOD DAY. RIGHT, LET'S TAKE TEN MINUTES EVERYONE. YOU ARE OFF THIS CASE WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT. OKAY GUYS, LET'S TIDY UP IN HERE. JAMES, LEGO AWAY, THEN STRAIGHT UP FOR A BATH. BUT I HAD ONE WHEN KATE WAS ON DUTY. NICE TRY. BATH NOW PLEASE. BUT IVE HAD ONE. DON'T LIE. IM NOT LYING. RIGHT. GO AND GET GEOFF. IVE HAD ENOUGH OF HIM. GET OFF. GET OFF! GET OFF! GET OFF! AND DON'T GET OUT UNTIL YOU'RE CLEAN! IT WAS ALL KICKING OFF TODAY WASN'T IT? YEAH, I KNOW, I HATE RUTH. YEH, ME TOO. PLEASE, BE QUIET. SHUT UP IF YOU WANT TO LIVE. IT'S REALLY LATE. AH, GET OFF ME. GET OFF ME! JUSTIN, LEAVE HIM. WHAT? I SAID LEAVE HIM. MAKE ME. THAT'S ENOUGH! OUT. ALL OF YOU. YOU STAND THERE. YOU THERE. YOU FACE THE WALL. IF I HEAR ANOTHER... FACE THE WALL! IF I HEAR ANOTHER SOUND FROM ANY OF YOU, THERE'LL BE TROUBLE. AND I MEAN TROUBLE! HELLO, IM HERE TO TAKE PAUL AND JAMES OUT FOR THE AFTERNOON. IM SORRY, YOU ARE? THEIR MOTHER. IM AFRAID WE DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE COMING. I DID PHONE. IM SORRY MRS WALKER, BUT WE HAD NO NOTIFICATION. I RANG AND I LEFT A MESSAGE WITH KATE WHO WAS ON DUTY. YES, WELL IM ON DUTY NOW. NOT KATE. SURELY THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM WITH ME TAKING THEM OUT? NOT WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITY THERE'S NOT. I HAVE THE AUTHORITY, MY SOLICITOR RANG UP SOCIAL SERVICES. YOU CAN'T STOP ME FROM SEEING MY CHILDREN. ACTUALLY, YES I CAN AND I WILL, FOR THEIR SAFETY. MUM! THEY WON'T LET ME SEE YOU. IM SORRY MRS. WALKER. THESE ARE MY CHILDREN. I HAVE RIGHTS. WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON? THIS IS MRS. WALKER. SHE SAYS SHE'S COME TO SEE HER CHILDREN. WELL WE CAN'T LET YOU. WHY CAN'T WE SEE OUR MUM? THIS HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU PAUL, GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THIS. MRS. WALKER PLEASE CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN? IM NOT THE ONE WHO'S BEING UNREASONABLE. YEAH, LEAVE OUR FAMILY ALONE. THAT'S ENOUGH. YOU CAN'T STOP US FROM SEEING OUR MUM. MRS. WALKER, PLEASE COME IN TO THIS ROOM SO WE CAN TALK IN PRIVATE. IF MY CHILDREN WANT TO SEE ME THEN HOW CAN YOU STOP THEM? MRS. WALKER, WE'VE HAD NO AUTHORITY TO ALLOW YOU TO SEE YOUR CHILDREN. AND WE DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO STOP YOU. GILLIAN TUTT, SOCIAL SERVICES. PERHAPS SOMEONE WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT'S GOING ON? YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWED TO SEE YOUR CHILDREN IF WE LET YOU. MY SOLICITOR ORGANISED IT. I NEED TO SPEAK TO JOHN. AS IVE ALREADY SAID, JOHN'S BEEN TAKEN OFF THE CASE. FROM NOW ON YOU'LL BE DEALING WITH ME. WELL, I NEED TO SPEAK TO HIM. WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO INVOLVE A SOLICITOR? THAT'S MY BUSINESS. YOU KNOW YOU WON'T WIN. YOU'VE FAILED YOUR FAMILY TOO MANY TIMES. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. I THINK I DO MRS WALKER. I THINK I DO. WE'LL SEE. HOW ARE THEY TREATING YOU? FINE. BUT DO YOU THINK THAT GOD CARES FOR US? I KNOW HE DOES, JAMES. IM SCARED. WE WANT TO GO HOME. I KNOW YOU DO, I KNOW. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT? I DON'T KNOW, BUT GOD'S IN CONTROL. ALRIGHT, I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH NOW. BEFORE WE FACE THE MUSIC. HOW STRONG IS THEIR CASE? IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY. I MEAN, COULD GO EITHER WAY. AH, OK. MRS. WALKER, YOU'VE SET A DATE IN COURT TO REGAIN THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF YOUR CHILDREN? I HOPE TODAY WE CAN CONVINCE YOU TO SEE REASON. MAY I STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE WALKER CASE WAS DEALT WITH WAS WHOLLY PROFESSIONAL, THAT SAID, IT IS NOW OUR DUTY TO ENSURE A SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION. PERHAPS YOU COULD UPDATE US? DO YOU THINK THEY'LL LET US GO HOME? THEY WON'T LISTEN. THEY THINK THEY KNOW WHAT'S BEST AND THAT'S IT. WE HAVE HOPE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? PRAYING. I COULD SEE THAT SHE NEEDED SUPPORT. SO I OFFERED MY HELP, AS A FRIEND. AND I EVEN TREATED HER CHILDREN AS IF THEY WERE MY OWN. BUT SHE WAS SO IMBALANCED AND SHE WOULD FREAK OUT AT ME AND SCREAM AT ME FOR NO REASON! SO I JUST THOUGHT IT BEST TO LEAVE. BEFORE, YOU KNOW, SHE GOT ANY WORSE. WELL, THANK YOU FOR COMING IN TODAY GEORGE. YOUR CONTRIBUTION HAS BEEN INVALUABLE. BUT WHEN THE MOTHER APPEARED BOTH BOYS BECAME VERY, UPSET. BUT ALL CHILDREN IN MY CARE? THEY'RE TREATED WITH THE SAME LOVE, AND RESPECT. THEY'RE ALL WELL LOOKED AFTER AND GENERALLY, VERY HAPPY. THANK YOU, RUTH. THAT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD. THANK YOU FOR COMING IN. REGARDING THE LETTER FROM MRS WALKER'S PERSONAL PSYCHIATRIST, ALL THE CHECKS HAVE BEEN MADE AND IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT DR. LLOYD IS HIGHLY REGARDED IN HIS PROFESSION. WHERE DID SHE FIND THE MONEY, TO PAY FOR ALL THIS? I DON'T KNOW, I HAVE NO IDEA, IM SORRY. AND WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN? I THINK IT'S CLEAR FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT THE CHILDREN HAVE NEVER BEEN HAPPY. AND THIS FORMS THE BASIS FOR HER CASE, DOES IT? NOT HER CASE, NO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT'S NOT MRS. WALKER WHO BROUGHT THE CASE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IT'S NOT MRS. WALKER? WELL WHO ON EARTH IS IT THEN? I THOUGHT YOU KNEW. KNEW WHAT? RIGHT, WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON? IT'S NOT MRS. WALKER WHO FILED THE CASE... IT'S MY CHILDREN. HAS THIS BEEN DONE BEFORE? THERE IS A LEGAL STANDING FOR IT. MRS. WALKER, IM SURE YOU ARE AWARE THAT THE CHILDREN'S WELL BEING HAS BEEN AT THE HEART OF EVERY ACTION WE'VE TAKEN. BUT WE CANNOT LEAVE IMPORTANT DECISIONS TO THE EMOTIONAL WHIM OF A CHILD. THEIR FUTURE HAS TO BE DECIDED FOR THEM. DO YOU CONCEDE THAT MARY IS IN A FIT STATE TO CARE FOR HER CHILDREN? YES. AND HAVE YOU ASKED THE BOYS WHAT THEY WANT? WE HAVE IT ON PAPER RECORD THAT THE BOYS SUBMITTED TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND DID THE BOYS SIGN ANYTHING? NO OF COURSE NOT. THEN IT CAN HARDLY BE USED AS EVIDENCE. AND WHERE IS YOUR EVIDENCE MISS GRACE? CAN I SPEAK? IM NOT A STRONG WOMAN. AND IVE FAILED MY FAMILY. BUT GOD BE MY WITNESS I HAVE CHANGED. IM HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR MY FAMILY BACK AND I CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THAT I WILL NOT FAIL THEM AGAIN. MY BOYS HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THEY WANT TO COME HOME. PLEASE, LISTEN TO THEM. THEY ARE MY CHILDREN. AND I LOVE THEM DEARLY AND THEY LOVE ME. WE NEED FACTS, NOT FEELINGS MRS. WALKER. IF YOU CAN PROVIDE SOLID PROOF THAT THE BOYS ARE UNHAPPY AND WANT TO COME HOME THEN WE COULD CONSIDER IT. WELL WE DON'T HAVE SOLID PROOF, BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THE BOYS ARE UNHAPPY. WELL, I THINK THAT SETTLES IT THEN. HOW'S IT GOING? IM REALLY SORRY, MARY. THEY'RE RIGHT, WE DON'T HAVE ANY LEGAL PROOF. IM TRULY SORRY. YOU'VE BEEN LIKE THAT FOR AGES. COME ON NOW ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. PLEASE, MAKE US A FAMILY AGAIN. PLEASE. MRS. WALKER, IVE HEARD NOTHING TODAY TO CHALLENGE OUR POSITION, OTHER THAN YOUR WORD, WHICH IM INCLINED TO IGNORE BASED ON YOUR PAST ACTIONS. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT THE BOYS WILL BE BETTER OFF AT HOME. THEREFORE WE REMAIN ADAMANT THAT THE BOYS WILL BE BEST SERVED UNDER OUR CONTINUING AUTHORITY. MRS. WALKER, JUST GIVE UP NOW AND TRUST THAT WE HAVE MADE THE RIGHT DECISION FOR EVERYONE. PLEASE, HELP MY FAMILY. WHAT ON EARTH... YOU ARE SUSPENDED FROM THIS CASE. PLEASE LEAVE. NOW. I CAN'T ALLOW THIS TO GO ON. SORRY, GILLIAN. THIS IS SO OUT OF ORDER, - IF YOU THINK IM GOING TO SIT HERE AND LISTEN TO THIS... - GILLIAN. LET HIM SPEAK. IVE NOTHING TO SAY THAT MARY HASN'T ALREADY SAID. THEN WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING HERE? I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU. COME ON NOW, PAUL, YOU'VE GOT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF. I WANT TO GO HOME AND LIVE WITH MY MUM. YOU KNOW YOUR MUM'S NOT WELL. I BELIEVE SHE'S BETTER, WHY DON'T YOU? I WANT THE SAME AS PAUL. BOYS. COME ON, YOU KNOW YOU'RE NEVER GOING HOME. I PRAY EVERY DAY TO LIVE WITH MY MUM AND MY BROTHER. AND IF GOD WANTS THIS TO HAPPEN YOU CAN'T STOP ME. I KNOW MY MUM TRIED TO KILL HERSELF, BUT DOESN'T EVEN NEED FORGIVING. I STILL LOVE HER. IF WE'RE A FAMILY THEN WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER. WE SHOULD BE AT HOME. TOGETHER. PAUL, PLEASE. ALRIGHT. IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AFTER ME YOU CAN, BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO LOOK AFTER JAMES AS WELL. AND JUST SO YOU KNOW, I WILL RUN AWAY. IT IS THEREFORE THE DECISION OF THIS PANEL TO ALLOW PAUL AND JAMES WALKER TO RETURN TO THEIR MOTHER, MARY. AND, SUBJECT TO A SUCCESSFUL PROBATION PERIOD, ALL PARENTAL RIGHTS WILL BE REINSTATED. YOU'VE MADE ME A LAUGHING STOCK. YOU DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF THAT ON YOUR OWN. GET OUT OF MY SIGHT. JOHN! THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELL, IM JUST PLEASED IT'S ALL WORKED OUT. WELL DONE YOU. I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU. IM DELIGHTED FOR YOU. I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE DONE. I DID TRY TO DO THE RIGHT THING. YOU DO KNOW THAT? I KNOW. THERE'LL BE A FORMAL REVIEW IN SIX WEEKS TO CHECK THAT EVERYTHING'S OKAY. AND IT WILL BE. HAPPY CHRISTMAS, MARY. HAPPY CHRISTMAS, JOHN. AN ANIMAL SHED WAS A HUMBLE PLACE FOR THE SON OF GOD TO BE BORN. BUT HE CAME TO THIS EARTH FOR THE WRETCHED AND BROKEN - FOR THOSE WITHOUT HOPE. HIS LOVE IS UNMERITED AND UNDESERVED. A LOVE FREELY GIVEN THAT GIVES STRENGTH TO THE WEAK AND HOPE TO THE DESPISED. AS THE BIBLE SAYS "GOD CHOSE THE DESPISED" AND FOOLISH THINGS OF THIS WORLD "TO CONFOUND THE WISDOM OF THE WISE." EVEN IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY A CHRISTIAN CAN COPE BECAUSE OF THE LOVE OF JESUS. THE BIBLE SAYS "I CAN DO ALL THINGS" THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGTHENS ME" MAY THE LOVE CHRIST HAS SHOWN TO US ALSO BE DEMONSTRATED IN OUR LOVE FOR HIM, OUR LOVE FOR OUR FAMILIES AND OUR LOVE FOR ALL PEOPLE. AMEN. WHO'D LIKE TO OPEN A PRESENT EARLY? YES. THAT'S FOR YOU. THANKS, MUM. AND THIS ONE'S FOR YOU. THANKS, MUM. I NOTICED YOU'D LOST YOUR OLD ONE. IT'S PERFECT. MUM? YES? CAN I PHONE NANA AND GRANDAD? YES, WHY? BECAUSE I WANT TO WISH THEM A MERRY CHRISTMAS FOR TOMORROW. THAT'S REALLY THOUGHTFUL, JAMES. MUM. BEFORE DAD DIED HE HELPED ME PRAY AND WE TALKED ABOUT BEING A CHRISTIAN. I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THEN, BUT I THINK I DO NOW. THAT'S REALLY GOOD, JAMES. THAT'S REALLY GOOD. COME ON.
