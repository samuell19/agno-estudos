Film Two BREAKTHROUGH The great battle at Kursk had changed the balance of forces in Europe. Anglo-American troops hurried to land in Sicily. Italy, July 19 Treviso Airport Why won't he land? His arrival is scheduled at 9:00. There're still 3 minutes left. He just loves spectacles. Il Duche, we have several minutes. I'm appealing to your courage. You must tell him that Sicily has been taken. Italy is unable to repulse the Anglo-American invasion on its own. And this is the Chief of the General Staff talking? You must persuade him to agree to an armistice. I'll tell him that. In view of the serious situation on the Eastern Front, I can devote to you only 3 hours. My Fuhrer, the catastrophic events in Sicily... Catastrophic events! And who is to blame for that? The Italian troops! Their cowardliness! The poor command! Every soldier and officer abandoning the army must be shot. My Fuhrer, you don't know Italians. They don't wish to fight. In 1917, Clemenceau ordered to shoot every tenth man in the mutinous units. But we can't shoot everybody, my Fuhrer. We must rise above human suffering! Then we shall carry our mission. I'm afraid the Duce will tell him nothing. The Duce hasn't told Hitler anything, Your Majesty. The situation is catastrophic. The Anglo-Americans may be in Rome soon. The interests of our country call for making peace immediately. But how? Everything is ready, you only have to issue an order. What order? The Duce should be relieved of the hard responsibility for waging a war. We want you to issue an order to arrest Mussolini. Rome, July 25 Shall we reinforce the guard, il Duce? No. Should there be an attempt on my life and I'm killed, it will only create more difficulties. Perhaps today we should take bodyguards alone? The honour of the king guarantees his guest's safety. His Majesty is expecting you. Let's go. In the name of His Majesty the King, please follow me. You have to get in this car. What does this spectacle mean? It is necessary to save you from a possible attack of the crowd. There's no such necessity. It is the only successful operation of the Italian General Staff. Berlin, July 26 Who among you knows Italy? My Fuhrer, I've been there twice before the war. What do you think of Italy? I'm an Austrian, my Fuhrer. Your name? Otto Skorzeny. The others may go. Hauptsturmfuhrer, I intend to entrust to you a very important mission. My friend and our faithful ally Mussolini, has been betrayed by the King, and was arrested. At this time of danger, I can't abandon the greatest of Italians. It's imperative that we save Mussolini. My Fuhrer, I'll do everything possible. I'm entrusting this operation to you. Yes, my Fuhrer. Germany expects a heroic feat from you! You may go now. What measures do you suggest to take about the developments in Italy? General Field Marshal Keitel My Fuhrer, we have worked out Operation Student, that is the capture of Rome by the German troops and the restoration of fascist regime in Italy. For this, Rommel's group has been set up, but it's too small. I've ordered to summon Field Marshal Kluge. He's arrived and waiting for your call. Call him. Field Marshal, I need several division from your front, to transfer them to Italy. Don't interrupt! I know that you need those divisions badly. It's a hard decision for me, but you must understand. My Fuhrer, despite your categorical insistence, I cannot remove a single formation from the front. We have to withdraw. Our flanks are unable to withstand the onslaught of the Russians. The only way out is to straighten up the front line. I'm aware of this opinion of yours! You're too passive, you're imagining Stalingrad everywhere. Our commander at the Kursk Burge is Model. He shares my point of view. I will not leave Orel! My Fuhrer, living the troops at the Kursk Bulge would mean the death or imprisonment of almost a million soldiers. What would you say? My Fuhrer, do not leave Orel. We must try and hold our positions at the Kursk Bulge. Take note, Field Marshal Kluge, I'm not alone having that opinion. It is shared by these two generals, who are superior to you in position. My decision remains unchanged! Today, on August 5, the troops of the Bryansk front, assisted at its flanks by the units of the Western and Central Fronts, as a result of fierce fighting, have captured the city of Orel. Also today, the troops of the Steppe and Voronezh Fronts have broken the resistance of the enemy and captured the city of Belgorod! In the battles for liberating Orel and Belgorod, distinguishing themselves were the troops of Colonel-General Popov, Colonel-General Sokolovsky, Army General Rokossovsky, Army General Vatutin, Colonel-General Konev, Lieutenant-General Bagramyan, Lieutenant-General Gorbatov, Lieutenant-General Zhadov, Lieutenant-General of Tank Army Rybalko, Lieutenant-General of Tank Army Katukov, Lieutenant-General of Tank Army Rotmistrov, Lieutenant-General of Tank Army Bogdanov, the airborne units of Marshal of Aviation Golovanov, Lieutenant-General of Aviation Rudenko, Lieutenant-General of Aviation Krasovsky, Lieutenant-General of Aviation Grilov, Lieutenant-General of Aviation Naumenko... Getting ready for the offensive? Where's the commander? He's dining, Comrade Marshal. Just in time. The commander fortifies himself before the offensive. Right, Comrade Marshal. Greetings. - Let's dine together. - I don't mind. And I'll spoil your appetite Just crackers and tea for me. - You can't even have a drink? - The doctors... One glass won't do any harm. But before dinner, let's finish our business. Give me Antonov. Hello, Comrade Antonov. The Steppe Front under the command of General Konev has taken the positions for attacking Kharkov. The enemy is retreating along the entire frontline. But to prevent the Germans' withdrawal from the blow, we have to begin Operation "Railroad War". The echo of the partisan war rolled over all the enslaved countries of Europe - France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Poland. WARSAW Jockey, I bet on your horse and won a lot. Let's go and drink. There're again shootings in the city. Has Helena home? In a German uniform. Kowal's waiting for you, too. You'll go to the Apollo Cinema. - How many seconds? - Ten. In that time, one can run, through half of Warsaw. When you drive through Warsaw, avoid cafes, the clubs and the Terminal. There will be ours there, too. The troops is of the Army Group South, under the command of Field Marshal Manstein, have left the city of Kharkov. The Fuhrer's soldiers are determined to oppose the enemy with dignity. Another Russian airplane has been brought down by the fire of our anti-aircraft artillery. The Soviet ace is destroyed. Ah, Jockey, this time I won't let you go. Let's go and drink! Helena, run! Italy, September 12 Gran Sasso Lieutenant Fagioli ordered to remove sharp objects from your room. Unhook the gliders. Mussolini? Mussolini! Il Duce, I was sent by the Fuhrer to free you. A plane is waiting. What kind of fascism is that if it has melted like snow? It was betrayal. No, I seriously suspect that you deliberately wanted to disappear from the scene. Do you intend to fight together with me to the end? I got tired of the 20-year-long power. Not a minute of peace. The Duce's withdrawal from the political arena would mean that he has lost faith in Germany's victory. This would have been detrimental for Germany, and I won't allow it! It would be better, il Duce, to just disappear from the scene. Perhaps we'll have to publish an official announcement that the Duce has been seriously wounded in an airplane accident. My dear friend, I have to think about it. During my confinement, I wasn't getting any information. The situation is splendid! In the West, the Anglo-Americans are too slow about opening the 2nd front. In Italy, we're holding strong positions north of Naples. In Russia, an Eastern Rampart has been created on the Dnieper's bank. On September 21-23, the troops of the Central, Voronezh, Steppe and South-Western Fronts approached the Dnieper North of Kiev, September 23 Comrade Colonel, the loading has been completed. - Who is in the first echelon? - Orlov's and Troshkin's battalions. Remember: capture the bridgehead no matter what, hold it until the division's main forces move in. - I'll try to, Comrade Colonel. - What do you mean, "try to"? Why this unsure answer? It's hard to know the enemy's strength. You're reasoning like a sergeant, Colonel Lukin. Your crossing will be simultaneously a reconnaissance in force. Is it clear? Yes. Do it. Yes. Move it, boys. Move it. - Comrade Captain, a gun s drowned - Where? He struck across the raft, the horses and carts went into the water! The sergeant yells: "C'mon, swim it!" And himself holds his belly. - Who? Savchuk? - Yes, him. Wait a second. Wait, c'mon, hold on. Hold on a little more. I'll bandage you. - Is that you? - Yes. me. Save your strength, don't talk. Didn't happen. - What didn't happen, dear? - Didn't happen for me to live. What are you talking about! They'll operate on you, and then we'll drink at your wedding yet. Weep. Weep over me. Weep over me! I would have pitied you. I loved you. Savchuk, dear, what are you talking about? Zoya! Is Savchuk alive? To the field hospital! - Zoya, go to the left bank. - No, I'll stay with you. Go to the left bank now! It's my order. South of Kiev. September 24 I'm "Dnieper". I'm "Dnieper". Twelfth reporting. Twelfth reporting. It's General Rybalko. The forcing is going on successfully! We've got a good hold of it. Tula samovars have arrived, so the tea party will be on. The division artillery has crossed. - Where he transmitting from? - From that pontoon over there. Oh, damn it! Redirect all the artillery fire to the enemy's batteries. Yes. On the pontoon ahead is General Rybalko. Enemy aircraft approaching! I just knew that. Why were they let through? Where's our aviation? - They just left. - Ours left and theirs came. Order Krasovsky to send fighters now! How are they there? Alive? - Twelfth! - Everything's all right. - Twelfth! We're a alive! Alive, Comrade Commander. Our fighters. Request the situation north of Kiev. North of Kiev. September 24 What's the situation? Just figuring it out. It looks like we're going into the Germans' rear. Their defenses were weak here. Before the Germans catch their breath, we must take the village. - C'mon, let me smell your breath. - What? Your teeth again? - It's my teeth again, the bitches. - I'll show you your teeth! No vodka today! You got me? I like you, you Gypsy head, but you know me. Comrade Colonel. Comrade Colonel, it's all quiet in the village. I know it's quiet. Comb the village through, ever house. Right. All right. We'll be taking the village. Germans? Yes, that's Germans. Take our places! Bend down, Comrade Captain. It looks like a sniper shooting. He seems to be on the top of the church. Comrade Captain, let me check it. Or he'll give us no peace, the bastard. With armour-piercing, at the tanks, sight 12. Fire! Comrade Captain! Comrade Captain! Orlov. Orlov ordered the guns to him. There're tanks there! What the hell! There're tanks here, too. Run to Leontyev and pass him my order: the guns to Orlov. Be quick! There began something awful there, Comrade Captain! If you or I... You know, Comrade Captain... Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Run! It's a shame to leave such position. We could knock those tanks out. No! There're tanks there! What are you talking about? Crew! At a trot! The Messerschmitts! Come on! Forward at a trot, come on! What is it? It can't be. No, no, I don't want it. No! No! No! I'm thinking, so I'm not killed. There must be some justice in the world. I don't want it! Attention! Two battalions of the 206th Infantry Regiment of the division under my command have forced the crossing of the Dnieper. The main forces of the division are read to land on the seized bridgehead. Cancel the landing. There will be no offensive in your sector. And what about the bridgehead? Your division is being assigned to be part of the 38th Arm Shock Group. It has to move off now and be transferred to the Lyutezh bridgehead, where success is in the making. - But the battalions are fighting. - At war, every day is fighting. The battalions' actions must make the Germans believe that we'll concentrate our efforts right here, on that dummy bridgehead. But we'll make the main strike farther south. Is it clear? Tell the battalions to hold out to the last man. I can't give birth to men for you You got me? And I'll fucking shoot everyone who even squeaks about withdrawal! To withdraw where? Where? If you had your way, you would have run as far as Siberia. If you got no guts, go where no one sees you, and shoot yourself. But in silence. In silence! That's my advice to you. Go now. It's you, the devil! Where're the guns? - Put out? - Where's Lukin? Wounded in the stomach. You can write in your report that the guns have been destroyed. I'm here to be at your command. I can command a company, a platoon, a section. If you advise me to shoot myself, I won't. One more hour, and not one damned bit will be left of the battalion. And the division keep radioing: "Hold on! Hold on!" For how long can we hold on? This one was sitting on the church. He turned out to be ours. - What do you mean, ours? - A Russian, the bitch. One of Vlasov's men? Well, Vlasov's man, why don't you say something? He's lying. Got the jitters, the bitch. On the way here, he repeated "nicht" and swore like hell in Russian. He knocked down many of our men from that church, the bastard. Come on, give us a chain-type invective to prove it! Let the officers listen to you, don't be shy! So it was you shooting? Maybe you'll say your name? His name? He doesn't need a name. He himself forgot it. Selling your Motherland, bastard. Take him out! Yes! You dog! Comrades! Wait! Stop! Try to understand, they forced me. I got a wife in Arzamas. - Comrades, please understand! - Comrades? They forced you? A wife in Arzamas? But you sat on the church to the last minute! At least die like a man, you bastard! Comrades! - How many men have you got left? - Ten. Well, let's go. Yes, some drivers you got, Tsvetayev like pregnant cockroaches. The even came with whips, see? Never mind, boys, we'll fight in infantry now. Comrade Captain! - Comrade Captain! - What is it? Colonel Lukin calls both of you, asking about the situation. I'll go. Well, how is it there? It's not for long now. I wish it be soon. I can't stand lying down here. Comrade Captain, how long are we to hold here. About two hours. Tsvetaev! Is that all? Nothing more? That's all. Orderly! Carry me out into the trench. It's too stuffy here, I want some fresh air. I can't, Comrade Colonel. I have no right. I'm ordering you, you hear? Carry out the order. As long as I'm alive, I'm the regiment commander. There we go, in the open air. - Comrade Colonel, the situation.. - Don't say it, son. I understand. Tsvetaev. Sergei. Listen here. Give me our pistol. The Germans have warped mine. You'll find another for yourself. Take my Party card out of the pocket. You'll hand it in. Take care of yourself. You're still a boy. I'm sorry, Comrade Colonel. Why are you grabbing me like I'm a girl? Damn them! To arms! To arms, you unimaginable pop! Tsvetayev, you stay here with the machinegun.. Follow me! Hang in there! Where're you going under the buffets? Back in the trench! - Where's the machinegun? - Over there. Comrade Captain! - Comrade Captain! - Sashka! - Who are they? - From all the companies. Where's Orlov? - I don't know! - Where's Orlov? Anybody saw him? Breaking through! We'll be breaking through! Breaking through where? They're everywhere. That's the end of us. No talking! Don't lag behind! Back! Follow me! The tanks! All right, we'll be breaking through here, through the marshes. Those who are tired, take our kit-bags off. You bastards! Follow me! Forward! - Halt! Who is it? - It's me. Me. Sashka, where're the others? The were running after you. I saw Sklyar. Saw him making it into the forest. And where're the rest? Someone must have broken through! I saw Sklyar. We have to look for him. - Do you hear? - What? Someone's talking. Talking. Sklyar. - Sklyar! - What can you hear, Sashka? - Quiet. Do you hear now? - Yes. - Sklyar! - Yeah! It's Sklyar. - Sklyar! - Yeah! Sklyar! Sashka, come back! Captain Tsvetaev? I've brought my battalion. Look in the window, they're all there. There were 15 men left of the battalion. The battalion fought to the last bullet. Thus, Comrade Stalin, the enemy's plan to make the Dnieper an unassailable rampart has been thwarted. We have created over 20 bridgeheads on the Dnieper's right bank. In the battle for the Dnieper, the fight for Kiev, by its military - political importance, occupies a special place. What does the General Staff propose? You know that Vatutin's assault group has already made two attempts to break through from the south. However, the German defenses proved very strong here. It's hard to count on success here. At the same time, 38th Army, by diversionary attacks, managed to forty and expand a bridgehead north of Kiev. The General Staff believes that by strengthening the 38th Army we can count on success operating from that bridgehead. When can you begin this operation? No sooner than November 20, Comrade Stalin. Kiev must be captured no later than November 6, by the anniversary of the Great October Revolution. We've been ordered to take Kiev on November 6 with a blow from the north. Is it clear to you, General Moskalenko? Yes, it's clear. What is clear? You will be capturing Kiev. Take the command of the 38th Army and prepare an order about the offensive. General Rybalko. Tonight you'll begin the transfer of the tank army from the Bukrin bridgehead to the Dnieper's left bank. Your army will have to make a covert march along the frontline and again cross the Dnieper at the village of Lyutezh. Comrade Commander, it's very difficult to transport so many tanks unnoticed right under the Germans' nose. To make the Fritzes believe that you're not going anywhere, Chief of General Stuff prepared a deceptive order about our troops going over to defensive actions. But you, Pavel Semyonovich, must think about what to do for the Germans to get that order. - Top secret? - Absolutely. The Germans will get it. Leave him here, change into a captain's uniform and put this in his map-case. Yes, Comrade General. They finished dinner, now they will push on. Very good. We'll have to retreat. I didn't get you. I order you to retreat to the second trench. - Does the regiment commander know? - I know. Yes, Comrade General. Thank you, soldier Petrov. Well, now we can make the crossing. According to the order the 38th Army must break the enemy's defenses on the very first day of the attack. Our army's front of attack is set at 12.5 kilometers. The density of artillery barrels - 150 guns and mortars per one kilometer. To be sure to break the German defenses, I suggest to curtail the army's line of attack by 6 kilometers, thereby increasing the density of artillery barrels up to 300 guns per a kilometer of the front. Only 6 kilometers of the army's front of attack? The Germans will cut you through with fire from the flanks. Comrade Marshal, 300 guns per one kilometer of the front. We'll neutralize the German glanks' fire. It's an interesting suggestion, Georgy Konstantinovich. Comrade Marshal of the Soviet Union, the 3rd Tank Army, having accomplished a covert march along the frontline, has successfully crossed to the Lyutezh bridgehead. Good boys! According to our Intelligence, the enemy has not yet discovered your maneuver. How are you going to attack? There's an idea, Comrade Marshal. We want to mount, so to speak, a psychic tank attack. At night, with headlights on, and with this. Fedya, come on. November 5 Don't linger! Don't linger! Forward, with a rush! Come on! Come on! What's there in the 5th? Why did they lie low? - Give me Streltsov! - Streltsov here! Do you realize that your procrastination may spoil everything? We can't wait any longer! Raise the men! What? Oh, damn! - Give me a gun. - The gun! Come on, guys, follow me! Forward! Who's that? Gromov? Where the hell is he going? What is it? Your division commanders now go to attack? - Remembered 1941? - Couldn't wait an longer, I guess. I'm going to punish him alright... Gromov is wounded. They've broken the first line. Good for him, actually. - A daring commander. - I got all of them like that. Do you hear? Rybalko is coming. Good work, boys! Great! Thank you, boys. Thank you, boys. Thank you. Thank you, boys. Just great! Thank you, Kirsanov. Thank you, boys. Decorations for the whole battalion, to every soldier. - You have to go to the hospital. - The hell I have! Take a look at the list of officers recommended for awards. All right. There're several names missing here. Lukin, Kozlov, Troshkin. I wanted to draw up a separate posthumous list for them. No, in this list, for the capture of Kiev! The Order of the Red Banner! And include Captain Tsvetaev. If I only could... If I only could... Seryozha. Seryozha! Zoya! Slop! You're alive! If only you knew! If only you knew! Forget it. I love you. I love you. If things continue to go on like this in Russia, a second front may not be needed by next spring. Those were the words of Franklin Roosevelt. Who knows, perhaps that's why the US President and Prime Minister of Great Britain Churchill traveled to Teheran to meet with the Chairman of the USSR Council of People's Commissars. Welcome to Teheran, Comrade Stalin. - Have you warned the Americans? - I have, Comrade Stalin. How was your flight, Mister President? It was all right, if not for a lot of bumping over Baghdad. Marshal Stalin invites you to stay in the Russian Mission. I've already declined Churchill's invitation. I don't think I should accept the Russian one. According to the Russian intelligence, there're Nazi agents in Teheran. And so? Marshal Stalin fears that during moving from one mission to another there may happen unpleasant incidents. Harry, what do you think about it? Well, if it's a case of security... Let's go to the Russians. The President took up residence at the Russian Mission. Is this a joke? The Russians told him there're about 100 Nazi agents operatin in the city. And what do you know about it? We have no Intelligence. Uncle Joe is in the lead - 1:0. I'm glad to see you. I've been looking forward to this meeting a long time. It's I who is to blame for the delay of this meeting. Let's not look where to put a blame. Sooner or later, we have met. However, were it not for threat of assassination from Nazi agents, I wouldn't have been here as our guest. You seem not to believe in those agents? If such a threat did exist, I wouldn't be hiding in the Russian Mission. I think there're more serious reasons for my being here. After the battle of the Kursk Bulge, the Russians are entitled to special respect from President of the United States. We were counting on our wisdom. And we weren't mistaken. We'd better get down to our problem. As a matter of fact, it's only one, most important, problem, that of a second front. All in all, only in this year, the Soviet troops have freed over a half of our territory, destroyed 56 divisions, over 13,000 tanks, over 14,000 aircraft. In the recent time, the German High Command has transferred from the West 75 divisions and a great number of materiel. Despite that, the Red Arm continues to hold the strategic initiative in its hands. However, for the speediest defeat of fascist Germany, the Soviet people would like a second front to be opened in the nearest future. Gentleman, we have come to Teheran to set the exact date for the opening of the second front. Henceforth, the road to a liberated Europe must lie not only through Kursk and across the Dnieper, but also across the English Channel and through France. That's the result of the President's move to the Russian Mission. Invasion across the Channel would involve the most tremendous losses. A war presupposes losses, Mr. Churchill. I propose the Balkans as a possible landing place. We must not forget that Tito's army controls a half of Yugoslavia and that we can get the support there. This is all very well. Except, we'll be closest to the target across France. Well, this the matter for the Chiefs of the Staff. Why? Can't we decide it ourselves? Let's decide it ourelves. Happy New Year, fellow-countrymen! That's how we're celebrating the holiday, on foot. A joily celebration! Never mind, we'll be celebrating the next year in Berlin. Come on! Come on! Keep up, First Company! Move it, Slavs! Move it! Move it! - Hey, you gods of war! - Hey, Orlov! - Shut the door. - Invite me to the table. Move over. Our trophy, rum. I envy infantry, the get the best. You have to go to attack for this, by the way. Fritzes cork it so tight, you'll never get to the stuff. Just break the neck off. Don't you know how to do it? You're going to teach infantry, Tsvetaev? Put up our glasses. This is for you. Thanks. Well, to the past 1943 and the new 1944. To our victory! To all of you staying alive. To all the men staying alive. Or we'll die without you. We'll simply die without you. Zoya, why so mournful? Tsvetaev and I will live forever, we're bewitched. All bullets just bounce back from us. Forward, with no fussing! Happy New Year!
