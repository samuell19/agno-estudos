How is my wife? I'm sorry. I did everything I could. Excuse me. Nurse. I'm sorry, Sir. I'm genuinely confused. I've been working for 10 years with the doctor. But I've never seen a fetus disappear from the womb. I'm so sorry. Please excuse me. I..... I'm actually sterile. I don't know how Atikah got pregnant. My baby. The devil. A devil got your wife pregnant. And that same devil has taken the fetus away from her. This village believes in that kind of superstition. My baby. My baby! Atikah? Atikah! Atikah! Atikah! My baby. My baby. -Atikah. Give me the scissors. Atikah. -Where's my baby? Give me the scissors. Come on. Atikah! Atikah! Atikah! Atikah? Atikah! Help! Atikah! The Devil in the Womb The baby is healthy. Look, it's waving to you. Cute. Are we done? -Yes. You have to be careful, Ma'am. Pre-eclampsia. Your high blood pressure... ...may inhibit the oxygen supply to the placenta. What do you mean? -If you don't treat it properly... ...it will be dangerous not only for your baby... ...but also for you. So what do we have to do? You need to take care of your wife's emotional stability. Make her feel comfortable. And the most important thing, is you always have to be there. Remember, the fate of this baby... ...is in your hands. Not mine. Are you sure about this? You've left a promising career. For us. Of course I am. I will do anything for you and our children. I've just moved into a different department. I just need you to pray for me so that everything goes well. Open the curtain. Vito, don't run. Vito! Wow! Please help with this. Gosh, this is so lame. How many hours does it take to go to school? It's so isolated. Can you not complain now? Just go and unpack in your room. Hey, Alani! -Leave her be. I'll talk to her later. All right. Come on, watch your step. Mang Ujang, how are you? -I'm fine, Sir. Doing well? -Yes, thank God. This is my wife. -I'm Amelia. You can call me Mang Ujang. How far along are you, Ma'am? In five days, it will be seven months. I'm holding a party for it. Can you help invite all the people? You want to invite the villagers? Of course, I do. And if there's anyone who wants to help cook, do let me know. Of course, Ma'am. Thank you. -You're welcome. Thank you Mang Ujang. -You're welcome. Do you like it? -I love it. Oh? What? -Did you do all this? Yes, I did. Thank you. Now..... What? -Please, please. Just once. I'm going out. -Just once. Okay? Dad? Listen. Vito! Vito! Vito? Vito! -Your pants are dirty. Vito. Sorry, Sir. I saw him fall from the swing. It's all right, it just hurts a little. All right, let's go inside. Can you walk? -Yes. You should be careful next time. -Okay. Trust me. You'll get used to this place. If you could only open up your heart a little. You'll love it here. Especially because we're all together. Marni. Want some extra money? Of course. Do you have a job for me? My boss is looking for someone to help cook in her house. Really? -It's perfect, right? Who is your boss? The owner of that house down there. Do you want the job? You should be thankful for your father. He left his job in Jakarta. Moved here with us. So that he can have more time to spend with me and you. You do know that... ...my illness can be dangerous? I know, but I can..... What? Live alone in Jakarta? In a dorm? I can't let you do that. I can't let you go. I can't leave Vito either. We're a family. We should stick together. Why would I adopt you and Vito... ...if I don't end up together with you? Isn't that Mrs. Atikah's house? -It was. No, thanks. Everyone knows that that place is haunted. Right? -Yeah, it's creepy! I will be risking my life. I don't want to! Mom. Have you found your pills? Not yet, sweetie, I've been looking everywhere. I'll look in this box. Honey, don't bother. You need to go to that event with the villagers, just go. Or else they'll talk about you. I don't have the time to help you tomorrow. Gosh, honey. Enough. Listen to me. Once you're done with your job... ...you can drive back to Jakarta to get my pills. It's just three days, I can manage. Honey. The event will last until midnight. It's fine. Mang Ujang is waiting for you outside. Just go. Okay. I'll go, but you take care at home. Call me if you need anything. -Okay. Okay? All right. Vito, take care of your mother. -Okay, Dad. I have to go. Bye. Vito. Yes, Mom? -When you're done... ...just leave the window open. Okay. To let the breeze come in. Hi, little one. I hope you'll like it here. We're not done unpacking. But I promise I will. Okay? Little one. See you later. Mom? Mom? Dad, you scared me! You just didn't see me. Why are you awake? -Well, Dad, I..... What? I couldn't sleep. Go to your room. I'll lock the doors, okay? Honey, I have to go to work. Little one, stay healthy in there, okay? Take care of your mother. Good morning. Hi, Mang Ujang! -Ma'am. Thank you. -Are you going to work, Sir? Not exactly, Mang Ujang. I was assigned to check... ...the landslide that happened on the hill over there. Oh, the landslide? I know about that. -Yeah, that one. You should go. -Okay, honey, see you later. Remember, call me if you need anything. Okay. -Take care. Okay. You too. See you later, Mang Ujang. -Yes, Sir. I should go too. Excuse me, Ma'am. Thank you, Mang Ujang. -You're welcome. Alani? Vito? Alani? Mom, can you speak Sundanese? Sundanese? No. Why do you ask? Alani said you were singing in Sundanese last night. Alani! Can you hear me? You should start, eat up. Alani! Come down here! Can you... ...have some respect for your mother? Whatever, Mom. Give me your phone. -Mom! Give it to me. -What the heck? No! Give me your phone, let go! Did you really have to do that? Use your ears! But..... -You've been acting up, you know? You didn't have to throw it, Mom! Alani, we live in the same house! You should be helping me! But what do you do all day? All you do is lock yourself in your room! I'm not locking myself in my room! I wait for Dad to come home and open the door for him. Alani. Your youngest sibling will be here soon. I need you. Whatever. You never think about me, do you? All you care about is that baby. That baby is the only thing that is on your mind! This is my house. My rules. If you can't follow my rules... ...then go back to the orphanage. Go! Alani. What are you doing? I told you. You saw how she treats us. But it was your fault too. Vito. How many times do I have to tell you? Mom and Dad adopted us so that... ...they can have their own child as well. Can't you see what I've always been afraid of? We'll be abandoned. Before that happens, let's just run away. How can you leave me? I don't want to go back to the orphanage. Alani, promise me you'll make up with Mom? Alani? I'm sorry about what happened. Maybe it's because I haven't been taking my pills. That's why I'm having mood swings. Open it. That is... ...an insurance coverage plan... ...for your education up until university. For Vito, too. When you both graduate from university... ...that will be the second happiest moment of mine. Do you know... ...what's the first happiest moment of my life? It's when I decided to adopt you and Vito. When we became a family. You know... ...that I have a disease. So later... ...when..... If..... If I die when I give birth... ...take care of your little siblings for me. Please? That will keep me happy. I love you, Alani. Vito too. One night, something strange wakes up Tarom. Listen carefully. Can I sleep here? Alani! Help! Alani! Alani! Alani! Alani! Alani! Vito, it's me. What happened? It's Mom! -Mom? What happened? She's fine. Earlier. -Let me check. What is it? Everything's fine. But Mom. -Mom is fine, Vito. Alani, it's Mom! Calm down. -Alani. Mom was..... -Okay, calm down. Calm down. You stay here while I check downstairs, okay? It's me, Alani. It's me. Don't worry. What about Mom? Mom is sleeping downstairs, don't worry. Look at my cheek. Let me see? I'll take care of it tomorrow. Let's just sleep for now. You can sleep here with me. Okay? Alani, who is it? Dad? Dad! What's going on? There's something I need to tell you. Sit down here. What is it? Dad. Last night..... Last night... ...it was a mess downstairs. Mom was throwing a fit and making a mess. Vito, Alani! Breakfast is ready. Honey, you too! Okay. Let's talk about it downstairs while we eat. No, Dad, please listen to me! Did you know? Earlier this morning... ...the dining room was a mess. All the stuff inside the fridge was taken out. Mang Ujang says that sometimes civets can go inside homes. I told you! It was a mess downstairs, a huge mess! Do you not trust me that..... -Alani. Didn't you hear what your mother said? It was all an animal. Your mother hasn't been taking her pills... ...so she still has mood swings. We need to be understanding. Gosh. Just shower later, come down here! Let's have breakfast! Now let's have breakfast before your mother yells again. Come on. Vito, Alani, come on. Let's go. Look, it's empty. Last night, it wasn't mom. Vito. You hurt your cheek last night. What's next? We have to help mom, all right? Let's go. I didn't want to say anything. But in that house... ...those things do happen. So, the first owner of the house... ...was Mrs. Atikah. She was pregnant. But then she killed herself. She killed herself? Why? She killed herself because she was seven months pregnant... ...but the fetus just disappeared. Her stomach went back to normal. We all couldn't understand what happened. There have been other residents who stayed. But then they got possessed. They say the house is haunted. And the villagers... ...once asked for the help of a shaman. But it was no use. The spirit kept coming back. Well. The people here believe that... ...jujube water can repel evil spirits. But it's no use for that house. They say... ...the evil spirit enters through bloodstream. Bloodstream? -I also don't understand. So what do we do? What do we have to do, Mang? I'm so sorry, I'm just as clueless as you. Alani. Mang. Will you please help us? All right listen. I'll ask someone, maybe not to ward off evil spirits... ...but to just check on your mother... ...and to see if her baby is all right, okay? Okay, Mang, thank you so much. Alani, thank you. My body has been hurting the whole day. I know, Mom. I've been getting on your nerves since yesterday. Please forgive me. Mom, starting tomorrow... ...Alani and I will clean the house. You can rest here. Nyak. Yes? -If I fall asleep... ...you can just continue with the massage, okay? Yes, Ma'am. Your mother and her baby are healthy, Miss. It's all right. What is that, Nyak? Don't worry, it's just a tradition. If you ask me... ...I can't explain either. Okay then. -Miss. You can wait outside. Okay, Nyak. Let's go. -Okay. Done! Now let's take care of Domdom. Domdom, food is here! You have to get to know Domdom. He's right there, hey Domdom. This is Vito. He doesn't want to eat. Let's try her. Eat a lot. -Come here. Nyak? Nyak Enoh? Nyak? Nyak Enoh? Nyak, where are you going? Nyak! Nyak Enoh? Nyak, Nyak Enoh! Nyak Enoh, where are you going? Nyak! Mang Ujang! Mang Ujang, help me! Okay, okay! -Nyak! Nyak Enoh! Nyak! Nyak Enoh! Miss! -Nyak! Nyak Enoh! Nyak Enoh! Nyak! Nyak! Shut up! Don't disturb me! Get lost! You moron! Don't you know who I am? Idiot! -Mang Ujang! Don't stop me. -Nyak Enoh! The other world! I will come back! -Mang Ujang! What are these kids doing? Nyak! -What are these kids doing? I'm going back to the other world. No, Nyak! -Don't go! Nyak! No! Nyak! -Don't go! Mang Ujang! Nyak! -Alani! Nyak! -Nyak, listen to us! Come on, Nyak! -Mang Ujang! Miss! -Nyak! Miss! Don't go in there! Nyak Enoh! -Miss! Alani! -Mr. Ferdi! Please help! Alani! -Nyak Enoh! Alani! Alani! Enough, Alani! -Nyak Enoh, Dad! Nyak Enoh. Nyak Enoh! Nyak Enoh! Nyak! -Alani! Nyak Enoh! Mr. Ferdi. I appreciate that you called immediately... ...after this accident happened. I hope this tragedy does not bother your wife. Please excuse us. Thank you very much, Sir. -Yes, thank you. Oh, God. Sorry, Sir. Let's move it, quickly. I'm sorry. Sir. Excuse me, but who just died? One of the villagers. Poor thing. She got hit by a car. She was pregnant, too. Excuse me. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. I'm going to Jakarta tomorrow. To go get mother's pills. I also asked the office to investigate... ...what happened earlier. I promise. I'll come back with a shaman. Mom. Seven months. If we can gather information about the owner of this house... ...we can find a way to save mom. Excuse me. Peace be upon you. Vito. We need to find someone related to Mrs. Atikah. That way we can ask for help. About how to deal with all of this. Hello, Dad? Are you at Mang Ujang's place? Yes, I just got here. Mang Ujang? -I'm on the way with the shaman. Just make sure Mang Ujang gets the body. We meet at the front of the house. Okay, Dad. Mang? Hey! What? Where are you going? Home. I don't want to be here. It's scary. You don't think I'm scared? Don't you want to get paid? I do. But..... -Then let's go. You go. -Come on. I'll wait outside. Hey! Ratih! Ma'am? Excuse me. I'm afraid you might get cold. I'm sorry. Ma'am? Ma'am. Ma'am! Ma'am! Help! Help! Cover it! Vito? -Dad? Alani! Help me! Vito! -Dad! Alani! Vito. Don't worry, I'm here. We're safe now. Atikah's spirit that has been haunting this house is now gone. And Nyai Respati will check all the rooms in this house... ...to make sure the spirit doesn't come back. And since none of the villagers want to come here for the party... ...I'll invite my coworkers here. For the time being, you and Alani... ...should stay at Mang Ujang's house. Okay? No. I'm sleeping with Mom. Alani. Let Nyai Respati do her job. And I'll take care of your mother. I don't want to. I want to be with Mom. Alani. Listen to me. Atikah, a young woman commits suicide... ...because of the loss of her baby. Good evening, everyone. -Evening. This is the night we've been waiting for. Exactly at midnight... ...Nyai Respati will start our tradition. Tonight's event... ...is done for the success of our sixth factory. And as a sign of respect... ...our sixth factory will be under the supervision... ...of none other than... ...Mr. Ferdi. I hope your success will be come right after his. Miss? Alani! Where are you going? Dad, don't trust them! They're lying. They're not here to help us. Just a second. What are you saying? Stop this nonsense. Dad, they're going to take Mom's baby as a sacrifice! Dad! Come here! Alani! Listen to me! Watch your mouth! They are all my friends, my coworkers. They're here for the party. Get it done. -And look. Your mother is fine. Hey, where are you going? Don't go inside. Let's observe from here. You have to trust me. I know what's going on! Atikah lost her baby because of the ritual... ...the deal with the devil that her husband, Mr. Karta did! To build that factory! Look. We need to help her, Dad! We have to help her! Mom. -Alani. Alani, let me explain. Alani! Mom! Let go! Dad! -Alani! Dad! Let go! They're all evil. Hey! Vito. Don't go inside! Hey! If you go inside now, you'll end up like them. Listen. Trust me. Just trust me. Dad! -Let go! What did I say? Please give me some time. Give me time. Get it done or I will. Yes, Sir. Now, calm down. Calm down, Alani. Alani. Please forgive me. I beg of you. Please just let it be. Everything you said is true. Your mother and I... ...weren't always as well off as we are now. We were poor. I've always searched for a way to live a better life. And this is the path that I took. If this ritual fails... ...my life will be at stake. I know what I'm doing. Listen to me. You and Vito, and us. The four of us is enough for a family. Right? This one little thing... ...won't affect our family. No! You're wrong! Mom is willing to die for her baby! You can't take that away from her! Alani, listen. -No! No! -Alani! Listen! Listen to me. Mom. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Alani! Let go! -Ferdi! Start the ritual now. Mang, please help her. Yes. I will help your mother. I have an idea. Okay? Come with me. Let's go. -Okay.

Nyai! -Dad wake up! Dad! Dad! Dad! Two Months Later So it doesn't have to be a C section? Yes, if you keep this up. But we still might go for C section... ...if your condition changes. Don't forget to do a lot of walking, all right? Okay. Excuse me. Hello, Mr. Karta? The patient is with me, Sir. We can go with Plan B. Get everything ready. Yes, Sir. I'll prepare everything.
