Who wants its kiss? We want to. - We want to. Wow! Did you see how it kisses? - Yes. Amar, even I want one. I want one too. - Sure. Did you enjoy it? - Yes. You enjoyed, didn't you? - Yes. It was amazing. Even we want one. We want to see how she kisses. Sonia, don't you want one? Come on. Don't get scared. Otherwise, it will fly away. Sorry. It's okay. - I felt something. Amar is head over heels for you. - Come on! He got you a kiss first and you are saying that he is head over heels for me. Because I asked for it first. He will give you even if you don't ask. He will kiss you. Shut up. Or else, I won't spare you. It didn't seem like a kiss. - No, I think it was. In fact, it was more like this. Oh, yes. We don't need a butterfly. That's right. But if you really like it then take it. Sonia! Catch me! - Don't run away. Come on. Stop.. Preeti, listen to me. Preeti. - Yes. Take her home. What's the use of doing all this? I don't want to do it. - Again? I don't want.. - Come on. I forgot to tell you. Mangal gave eggplants for reasonable prices. What are you doing, girl? Go. Get up. What are you looking at? Get up. Get up! I am already very tired. If you can't help me then don't add to my work at least. Shall I slap you? Dad, don't hit her. Dad! - What else should I do? A son would have helped me. I am tired alone. - Dad, I will help you. What's there to do? I will die one day then all three of you will shed tears. Dad, we will do it again. We will compensate for the loss. Come on. Preeti! Preeti! - What is it? You will escape dad's beating. Many boys will be there for you. And then you will be free! Right! Where will I go? Go to Mumbai, Delhi.. You can go wherever you want. Mumbai! Even Deepika lives in Mumbai, right? I may bump into her. Or I may come across Salman. Right? Yes. We hardly see all the people in our village. And you are talking about Salman and Deepika. Silly! Will you come along? Why would I come? And why would your husband allow me to accompany you? Tell me. - And.. Who will take care of my kids? Will I do that? I will come to you when you have kids. Think about it again. I am going to have many kids. You rest now. Okay? For what all things are we dependent on Mumbai? Ma'am. - Yes. Films. - Shut up. Would you come with me to check the e-mail? Why? - It will be an unnecessary expense. Dad won't like it. I will pay for you. Do you still have the butterfly with you or did it fly away? I still have it but it doesn't give me a kiss. Oh! She must be fearful. She isn't fearful. That's why, it doesn't try to escape. I think, they start considering the bottle their home after a certain point of time. It's strange, isn't it? But what's the point in keeping a butterfly? Free the butterfly. I didn't catch it to free it. - Then? I can kiss the butterfly as much as I want. Oh, please. Don't lie. I am telling the truth. Have you seen your face? - I look good. Right? You do. - Hello! The system is vacant. But the connection is slow. Let's go. - Let's go. Do you remember your ID? - Yes. Amar, would you buy me a candy? - Sure. Sir, do you know what butterflies eat? Have you gone mad? They have the nectar of flowers. You must apply fairness cream. You will look fair. We saw.. - A policeman. His uniform was brown.. - And shoes were black. He was wearing a belt and had a stick. He was whistling and he was the first one! We saw.. - A policeman. His uniform was brown.. - His shoes were black. He was wearing a belt.. - Had a stick. He was whistling.. - He was the only one! I am sorry, Shivaji to have come here without informing you. What are you saying, sir? I have come here with my fucking problem. What else will I do? When will you return my money? Will you give it back in this birth or will I have to take a rebirth to recover? Sir, there's no rain. What is my fault? I can repay your money only if I harvest. If I had a penny for every excuse of yours then I would have become a millionaire. Sir, what should I do? Give me some time. Please come. Mom, the aroma is good. - I'm glad. We don't have anything to eat and you are wasting money on this. Just understand this. We are unlucky and you are ugly. You won't become beautiful by applying fairness creams. God has blessed you with strength. Just do your work. Are you getting me? God gave me an ox instead of a son. And He gave us this whore! Have it. Dada Thakur will take us. He will throw us out. How will everything get into place? Preeti will get married. And we will lose everything. And the ox will be with us. - Everything will be fine. Sonia! Dada Thakur will throw us out. He will get us killed. You don't look like an ox. You know.. Preeti will get married. We will lose everything. Preeti! Preeti! Let's go. Come on. Come on. Preeti! Come over here. Hush! Don't make noise. Preeti! Sonia! Preeti! You will rot! I work so hard all day! I toil all day. What do I get? Nothing! What have I done? What is my fault? Infertile! Get it? You are infertile! Come on. We are already late. He will deduct it.. I will have to deduct, right? Don't get scared. I will help you get a good job in Mumbai. Girl! Come on. Leave me. - What? Come on. Dad! - What dad? Dad! Preeti! Sonia! - What are both of you doing? Leave her. Just leave her. Dad, where is Preeti going? Where are you sending her? - What are you doing here? Can't you stay out of this? - I see. Your other daughter is also here. Shivaji, this is a signal from God. Send her along. No, Dada Thakur. Who will help me in my work? Why did you come? Dad, where is Preeti going? Don't send Preeti away. Shut up. Or else, I will slap you. - Dad, for my sake. Even she is good. Yes. Get out. Go from here. Get out. - Dad. Take her away. - Dad. - Go from here. Dad, Preeti.. - Sonia! Preeti will do the chores. - Sonia! Dad! Sonia! - She will do the chores. She won't make any mistake. - Sonia! - Throw her out. Dad! - Sonia! Dad, Sonia! - Dad! Dad! - Sonia. Come on. - Sonia. She won't make any mistake. Sonia. - She won't make any mistake. - Keep quiet. Come on. - Dad! Dad! - Sonia! Sonia! Sonia! - Girl! Come on. Sit down. - Don't cry. Come on. Don't get scared. Come on. I am with you. - Dad. Come on. - That's it. Come on. Let's go. Sit down. Stop crying. Enough. Dad, don't sell me off. Don't get disheartened. Go. Don't cry. Dad! - It's okay. - Dad! Look at me. Don't cry, okay? Don't think about it. My father often visits Mumbai for his work. What if something bad happens to her? You always think negative. Send her an e-mail. Ask her about her well-being. - Yes. Do you want that butterfly? What will I do with the butterfly? You keep it with you. - Then I will free it. Okay. What are you doing? - Will you be my girlfriend? You are making fun of me, right? No, I am holding your hand affectionately. You realised this love as soon as Preeti left. No, Sonia. I have always liked you. Liar. - No. I am telling the truth. You are lying to me, right? No. - Liar. Stop, Sonia. - You are a liar, Amar. You are lying. Dad. Did you enquire about Preeti? Shall we go and meet Preeti? She is doing her job there. You do your job. Can't you hear me? Get back to work! No, I'm not going to listen to you. Send me also to my sister. I see, so you also want to go there. Yes.. Give my money as well to dad. Where is your father? Does he know that you're here? Come here. Let me have a close look at you. Come here.. Come on.. Sit here.. Hey, just sit here. Your sister has left. Send me there too. I'll also work over there. It's quite complicated. You won't understand. I'll have to spend a lot of money to send you to Mumbai. Sir. - Yes. Send me there anyhow, please. You're so stubborn, aren't you? Dad. Go inside. Call Anjali here. - Yes, sir. Are you happy? I'll send you to your sister. It's quite late, stay here tonight. No. Come back tomorrow. Mumbai is a city. It's not a village. Once you go there, you won't feel like returning. You're so slow. Hurry up. Sonia, where are you going? And who is she? - Hey, we're in hurry. She'll tell you everything later. Come. Sonia! Sonia! Over here, yes. Oh, my good Lord! - I'll have to open it.. We've reached Mumbai, right? Are you saying looking at this? This is nothing compared to Mumbai, come. I think we'll have to stay the night in a hotel. Hello. Welcome to Laxmi Lodge. We need a room for one night. You seem to have come from very far. First floor, right? - Yes. Name? - Anjali. Name? - Anjali, I told you, right? How much? - Rs. 1,500. Where are you travelling to? - Mumbai. I need to check my e-mail. May I use the computer? Yes.. Sure. - There's no need. Don't bother him. It's fine. You may use the computer. Come on. Your luggage? - She is my luggage. You haven't slept yet? Yes, I need to check my e-mails. Come over here. Come. Where does she live? In Mumbai. That's where she works as well. I'll get to meet her tomorrow. She will jump with joy, seeing your mother and you. No, she's not our mother. We are not related. Then who is she? She.. Listen, run away. - What? Leave from here as soon as possible. What do you mean? - She is poison. Let alone helping you out, she will put you in trouble. The bus station is nearby. Just go home. No, she's taking me to see my sister. You have no idea where she's taking you. Keep this money and go home. Or you will regret it, dear. You bus arrives in two hours. Go. Take the bus and go home. Just go! Go. Now tell me. Did that place seem like Mumbai or this one seems like it? Mumbai will suit you. Don't be nervous. Come, we've to go this way. Come. Hey, move aside.

Are you going to reform only if I starve you for a couple of days? Ms. Madhuri, I'll do exactly as you say. Ms. Madhuri.. - Come. Preeti.. Preeti! Shut up.. - Leave me! - Hey, shut up. Leave me! Leave my hand.. Leave me.. Don't touch. No.. Preeti! - Mr. Bunty, we have a runner. Hey, you, are you blind? Watch where you walk, bitch. Preeti! Preeti! Hey, wait. Preeti! Preeti! Hey! Do you want to meet Preeti? Do you know where Preeti is? Of course, I know. Come with me. Come on.. Come with me. - Is Preeti okay? Yes, she's fine.. Yes, we're almost there. Here.. - Preeti! Preeti.. Preeti, hey! Preeti! Look, who has come to meet you. Look who's here to meet you. Say, 'Hello'.. - That's not Preeti. It's not Preeti. - Yes, it is. This is not Preeti. - It is Preeti! It's Preeti, she's asking how you are. - Preeti! Talk to her. - Preeti! Where do you think you're going? Were you running away? - Let her run away. Leave me! - Let her escape! - You want to run away? Leave me! I said, leave me! Come on.. - We found her, Faisal. I'm talking here, right? I know you give extra money to be rough. That doesn't mean that you would beat her to death. What kind of a man are you? You raise your hand on women? Look, they're all my girls. I will save them until they die.. Got it? No.. No, Mr. Faisal. You will respect them now. Do you understand? I'll deal with you in a moment. Hello. Welcome to Mumbai. Welcome. Yes, look here. Look over here, dear. W-What is this for? I'm clicking a picture, dear. It's just a picture. You're looking good. Smile, baby, smile. Pretty.. Nice. Come here. I'm not doing anything to you. Don't do it. Let me see your mouth. She's fine. What are you doing? Is she a virgin? Tell him. - No, Faisal. As if you know. Leave.. Leave me! Leave me! Leave! No! Leave me! Why are you crying? What did I do? Why are you crying? You're absolutely safe here. You're safe. Everyone is safe here. Okay? Demons like him? I'm here to protect you from them, okay? Dear, you have come to your home. You have come home. You're home, okay? No.. - Don't.. Ms. Madhuri here.. She will explain everything to you. Okay, dear? Go. - No! - Go.. No! Take it. Motherfucker! - No, Mr. Faisal! Mr. Faisal, no! Mr. Faisal! Hey, what is it, Bunty? Hey, shut your trap, whore. Don't disturb them. And listen, this is your home from now onwards, got it? Keep it down! Sir, we'll be doomed. Return Sonia to us. I swear, I don't know where Sonia is. She had come to me, I scolded her and sent her back. Take this. Not this, sir. I want my Sonia back. Asshole! You're refusing to take money? Take it. Go now. Come on, go now! And never come back here. Go.. Go inside and set the pipe. - Yes, I'll do it. Hey! I'm sorry. I wasn't fucking with you. I was just kidding. What's your name? Tell me! - Sonia. - Sonia.. Who is this Preeti that you were calling out to? Who is Preeti? - She's my sister. What! Did you say you have a sister! A sister! You, moron! Do you think they'd let both the sisters stay in one place! Look, it's not a hostel. It's a brothel.. Do you know what a brothel is? A bottle? - It's not 'bottle'. Silly! Listen, you better forget everything. By the way, this place is not that bad. It's a very good place for a dark complexioned girl like you. You can live here peacefully.. Are there many more brothels over here? Scoundrel! When he got remarried he snatched away my son from me. I was almost dead before I came here. Now have me all you want. Bastards! Ma'am.. Do you know where my sister is? Why don't you consider me your sister? I can be your sister. I'm here for you, right? You can call me Sister Rashmi. Hereafter, you can treat me like your sister, okay? No. - Isn't it? - No, Preeti is my sister. She has left the place. She's left.. Hey! Get away from her. Preeti out, Rashmi in. You may pick any dress of your choice, okay? It's my collection. Hey, do you know how much the boss paid for you? He paid a hefty amount. Do you know that? Nobody comes to Mumbai for free. You need money. Who will pay all the money? Do you understand, you idiot! Speak up. Do you want to meet Preeti? Do you know where Preeti is and what kind of work she does? You ask so many questions! Come, let's go.. Look! You'll be able to meet Preeti soon if you do as I say. Do you understand? Do you want to meet her? Tell me. Yes. - Exactly. Then you should first repay your loan. Later, you and your sister can go wherever you want. You can do whatever you want. Can you do me a favour? Can you inform Preeti that I'm here? I will fix everything. Sure, why not? I will definitely inform her. Okay? Go now. Go change your dress. - Will you really inform her? I told you that I'll inform her, didn't I? Now leave. I said, go! Sir. - Yes. Oh! My sweetheart! You must be missing your home! Yes. Actually my sister.. Do you know where she is? Yes, sit next to me.. We'll find your sister, okay? Everything will be fine. All right, tell me something. Do you have a boyfriend? Do you? No. - Tell me the truth. At least, you might be looking at boys, isn't it? What's his name? Come on, tell me. Amar. - Amar.. Has he ever kissed you? - No. - Has he? He hasn't? - He has just held my hand. It's such an amazing love story! Don't intervene. I'm talking to her, right? All right, did you do anything else apart from holding his hands? I mean, anything more.. All right, have you ever had oral sex with him? - No! You never did it? We didn't engage ourselves in such acts. It's okay. You'll learn it gradually. Yes, I'll teach her. - Exactly. Madhuri will teach you how to do it. Don't give her a chance to complain, okay? Learn it from her. - I don't want to learn it. Stupid! Didn't I explain to you? Don't you want to meet your sister? Why are you getting angry with her? Speak to her politely. Look, dear, I know where your parents reside.. Okay? If you refuse to learn it then you'll be in trouble. So, will you learn it? Learn it properly. You can do it. Say that you'll learn it. - No. You can do it, dear. You can do it. I know that you can do it. - No. You can do it, dear.. - No! - Hey! Dare you say 'no' to me! Do you understand? You don't seem to understand as I'm talking to you politely. I'll disfigure your face. Hey, take her away. I told you so many times! You tarnished my image. Idiot! Sit down and clean the commode. - I made a mistake. Do you have any sense? They'll fuck your sister if you overact like this. Do you understand? - No, please don't do that. I made a mistake. Please forgive me. You better scrub the entire toilet. No one understands if spoken politely. Are your sisters beautiful and fair like you? Yes. - Would you like to come to Mumbai? No, my family won't send me. All right, go get a cup of tea for me. - Okay. She left the house without my consent. I didn't want to send her. Please do something. - What do I do? Then whom will I approach for help? Who will listen to my woes? What do I tell you and how do I explain? Listen, mister. I'll tell you where she is but you should go and bring her by yourself. Do you understand? - Yes. Do you know where Mumbai is? Just keep your mouth shut, take a seat in the bus. I'll take care of the rest. Three for a price of Rs. 150.. It's branded stuff. Buy it all! Buy these leather ones for Rs. 100! Hey.. Look, if he tries to force himself on you then scream real loud. Otherwise, the boss will kill you. He is calm till now. Don't make him angry. Do you understand? Come on, open your mouth. Wide open! Yes.. Now swallow it. Everything will go well. Let's go. See, listen.. Both of them are village girls. No broken.. They are virgins.. Yes. They are village girls. They are virgins.. They are village girls. They're innocent. Yes. No, they're fresh.. Yes, fresh! Not broken.. No! They're virgins.. They're village girls. No, you don't understand what I'm saying. No, you fucking.. They're from the village. You don't get it. They're better than city girls. Motherf.. Fuck you! You motherfucking bastard! Damn it! Move it. Whom do you want to meet? She doesn't work here. Get away from here.. Get lost! How are you? Come closer. Catch her! Catch her.. You caught her! Buy some bananas! A dozen bananas for Rs. 20! A dozen bananas for Rs. 20! It's good, isn't it? - Yes.. Hey.. Come here! Neetu, Afza. Get out. - They won't be going.. - Hey.. She's fresh meat. Who do you want? You want younger than them? Come on, speak! Hey, Mr. Patil, how are you? I'm great, Mr. Jeetu. How are the kids? - Everyone is fine. Your wife? - She's good. Tell her not to feed you so much. Take a look at your paunch! Jeetu! - Coming! Sonakshi is in which room? Hey, hottie! Hey.. - What happened? Come with me! Where are you going? What happened.. What happened? Where are you going? What happened to you? Hey, ma'am! Hey.. Bananas.. Bananas! You want to eat? Did you see any police officer? No. What work do you have with them? I saw one just now. I don't know where he disappeared. If I don't find him, I'll have to go back. Where? They can do anything to my sister. Where is she? What does she do? Oh, she is a sex worker! So, you are one too.. So, you are one as well? Sex worker.. Where are you going? She's a sex worker. Hey, ma'am.. - Move aside.. Move.. Stop.. Stop! Stop.. - What happened.. Please help me. What happened? - My sister is trapped. She's been held captive. Sit inside. - Buy fresh vegetables. Buy fresh vegetables.. Buy fresh vegetables! We've received a few such complaints. Could my sister be here? She might. Don't worry. We'll look for her. All right? Hey, don't speed.. Do you want to do it? I'll come back at night. Sir.. - Yes? You don't love your sister? You want to get her killed? Do you want to get not only her but also your family killed? No, sir. I've done so much for you. I brought you home. I made you the apple of my eye. I treated you like a child. Now, she's stabbing me in the back. I'm very hurt. Very. I'm a good man. I'm not a bad man. - No.. Please don't.. I'm a good man. - No.. Please.. Sir, no.. - There.. Who is saving you from the hellish world? Ms. Madhuri, please tell him.. - Who is saving you? Tell me! Tell me! Who is saving you from that world? I won't make the same mistake again.. You.. Please.. Ms. Madhuri.. Sir asked me to throw it away but.. This isn't meant to be thrown away. It's my Sister Preeti's. Listen.. If you follow all the rules I'll beg sir to let you meet her for two minutes. Really? You know.. When I was very young my sister and I would secretly go to the movie theatre. Upon returning home, we'd enact the entire story before our dad arrived. Even you need to think that all this is just a movie. A movie has to come to an end, right? T-The g-girls are ready. Hey.. Chinese guy, don't try to fool me. The deal has been agreed upon. You sending the money or not? No.. No money, no girls. Okay? Who is this? Well? What is your name? You look very different today! You look nice. Hey, what happened? Hey, Sunita.. - Yes? - Hey.. You aren't ready yet? - Hey.. Sunita! Where are you? You do it.. - Give me some kohl.. Have you seen Madhuri? Hey, prostitute, I haven't. Get lost! Yes, I.. Let's.. "Pulled my hand.." Do you know where Madhuri is? She left. What are you saying.. - Yes.. Want a puff? No. You know.. Every day, Teja says, 'I love you'. He keeps repeating that he loves me. Do you know why I call him by a specific name? "Fixing your gaze somewhere but aiming somewhere else!" The bastard says that he won't wear a condom. 'Our bodies must rub against each other, Rashmi!' He loves you? That's what he says. He will take you away from here? Hey.. What do you mean by that? I can leave this place whenever I want to. Really? Really. But where will I go? Home. People like us get disowned by our families. But my family isn't like that. Not even my distant relatives talk to me. I'm an insult to them. Where will we go if not home? Oh, little girl.. We've been dead to them for ages now. All we can do is make the best of these hellish people. I eloped and got married to my lover. The only family I had was my son. My husband married someone else. I didn't agree to it. So, he took our son. And sold me off into this hell. So, tell me, my dear.. Where will we go? Well? "Om.. Peace.." "Peace.." - How is everything, ma'am? Hey, Mr. Deepak! How are you? - I'm good. Asha.. No.. Not Asha. I want someone new today. Sure, take your pick. Katrina, Meethi, Priyanka, Sonu, Rashmi, Deepika.. Get up, all of you. What are you doing? Take your pick. There was one more.. I saw her the other day. She was a dark girl. She was young. - I see.. Somehow, you got to see her.. You cannot hurt her, okay? - Yes, I know. Sonia. Sonia.. It's her, right? Oh, no.. Listen, Sonia. Excuse me. Don't be scared. Nothing will happen. How old are you? I'm 17. Have they forced you into doing this? I'm Manish. I run an organisation which helps girls like you get out of such places. There's that young girl, Asha, right? She was fair and seated there.. We are helping her as well. Please sit. I just want to talk to you. Sonia.. The customer was very happy with you. What happened to you? I got you something. Eat it. Nothing will change but.. Hang all the clothes. May the bitch just die! You can go in. Excuse me. You can go in. It can be controlled with ART but it cannot be cured. Now, you'll have to make all your customers wear condoms. Let all the bastards die! Don't lose hope, Madhuri. You have a long way to go. "You pinched me." "You have pinched me here and there." "I am mad.. I am mad at you.." "Come, mollify me, O beloved.." Hey.. Remove it.. Remove it. - What happened? Remove it. Come on, remove it.. No. Am I any less than your sister? Hey, get lost. Wait, remove it! Hey.. Does it have golden wings? Are you removing it or not? I'll show you. - Quiet.. What is it? You're a prostitute just like us. What are you? A prostitute.. A prostitute.. A prostitute! She's not like you. What did you say? She's not like you.. - I'll slap you. But you're here. Soon, you'll become one of us. It'll be fun. Take it. Take it. What happened? Okay, take it, it's yours. Take it.. This is your place, you bloody bitch! You're no different from us. You're no better than us! Understood? Get lost! Get lost! Go! Get lost! Bloody bitch! Bloody bitch.. What is this? What number is this? If you go as a customer, you'll get to know which building Preeti is in. Sir.. - Yes? Well.. Well, you see.. Sonia.. - Yes? She's soaring too high. She thinks she's royalty. Why are you worried? I'm here. Why should I worry? Sir.. It's time to fight. Sonia is a troublemaker. Don't worry. Go on.. You're a queen. 'Abdul. He just has a limp now' 'but if his tongue gets cut off, he'll become mute. Shut him up.' She got scared? Happy? - Yes. Go. Go. 'One must find a cure to it on one's own.' 'One must forget one's sorrows.' 'Look..' - Sir.. - Get lost! 'He performed the last rites of the child..' 'He had it all..' 'He had money, a car, a bungalow, a kid..' Come on, let's explore Mumbai. Come on. Let's go.. Sit at the back. Come on, get in. Be comfortable. Very good. Where do you want to stay? Choose any house you like. It will be yours. Trust me. I am not joking. What.. - Come on. Come with me. Preeti! Preeti! Go away! Get out! Preeti.. Look.. Who are you? Get out! What has happened to you, Preeti? It's me. Sonia, your sister. What have I done? I am your sister, Preeti. What has happened to you? Are you all right? Are you all right? 'We saw a policeman.' A policeman.. 'We saw a policeman..' Do you remember this? Do you remember this? Look at me.. Look at me. I am your sister, Sonia.. No.. Don't cry. We'll go away from here. Don't cry. Everything.. Everything will be fine.. This is all your fault! This is all your fault, Sonia! Everything.. No.. - You need to go.. You need to go! Preeti, look.. I am here. Everything will be fine. I will fix everything. You knew that dad was going to sell me! You didn't tell me that, not even once! No.. No, I didn't know, Preeti. You need to leave! I didn't know anything. Had I known about it I wouldn't have let you go. I had come there. I didn't know.. Look at me.. You were jealous of me. You were always jealous of me. Get out. Get out! Get out of the car! I don't want to see your face! I don't want to look at you! Go away! Where you are today.. Wherever you are.. You deserve to be there. Die here. Come on. - Do you understand? Get out! - Come on. Go away! Come on.. Let's go. - No.. - Let's go.. Let's go. - Let me talk to her.. We will come again tomorrow. Let's go back. Please let me talk to her. Hey, give me the pill. We will come again tomorrow. - Preeti.. Preeti, I am not jealous of you. I am not jealous of you.. - Go on.. I want to talk to her.. I am not jealous of you.. Preeti! I am not jealous of you.. Our loved ones become strangers and strangers become family. This is life. Don't worry. Let me take care of you. Everything will be fine. If God is willing.. I am not jealous of you.. I am not jealous of you.. I had told you that it will cost you about Rs. 2,000. You are coming tomorrow, aren't you? What? Do you want her? What is her price? A cigarette. Bastard, she shouldn't lose her virginity. You can only do her from behind. Tell me. No! Sonia.. Sonia.. Sonia.. Sonia.. Sonia..

I won't spare you. Get up. Sonia, let's go. - What.. What's with all this chaos? Get in. Get in! Come on.. - Come on.. Tambe, where are you? The police has raided the place. You bastard.. What the hell is this? There was a girl here.. - What happened? - Who are you? What happened? - You have kept two minors here, two girls. There are no girls here. T-There are women.. - Okay. Let us check, then. Ma'am, I do business. I run a business. I own a bar on the other side of the road. Hey! Keep quiet. We are checking the place. Let us search the place! Got it? - I am not stopping you. Come on.. Come on.. You too. - Come on.. Sonia! Asha! Sonia? Sonia! Asha! There's nothing there. Sonia! The business just got.. Hey, stay quiet! - This is illegal.

Sonia! - Hey, come out! Come out! Come on! - Sir.. Sir, she is j-just a kid.. - Shut up! Leave me! - Hey, you're done here! Hey.. - You took one girl away from here, right? There's no other girl. This is my area. - Hey, she needs help.. This is my area.. Get lost.. - She is there.. Take him away.. - She is inside, sir. Take him away! - She is a child, sir! Take him away! - What are you doing? - Listen.. There is a child in there! All of you are in on it. What did you say? - All of you are in on it. Is that so? - Hey, let it be.. What did I tell you? I'm a businessman. I do business. Who gave you the right to screw with my business? Now, talk decently.. - Sir.. Hey.. - What are you doing? Sir, stop.. Hey, take him away! Take him away.. - I'll deal with him.. Someone had complained to us about it.. Madhuri. Madhuri. Madhuri! Madhuri.. What are you doing? What are you doing? Well? Give it to me. Kill me. You owe me. Rubbish! Look, they took Preeti with them. After Asha, how many are left? You do the Math.. N-No, sir.. That's not true.. I need to continue my business. Please don't send me. I'm sick. Please don't send me. Please.. Faizal, please.. J-Jeetu. Jeetu! Where the hell is he? Jeetu! - Faizal! Hey.. Come on.. Come on! You will die, you bastard. Sonia. They have taken your sister away. You don't have to worry. There is a lot of food here. And no monkey business in the container. Are you listening to me? Save your energy. There's a bucket there. You can use it as a toilet. Screaming here is of no use. You are surrounded by 12,000 containers. No one will be able to hear anything. You need to take care of yourself. Sonia. Sonia. Eat something. No, don't sleep. You can't sleep here. Eat something. I don't want to eat. I don't want to get up. Please eat. No.. Please.. No.. Absolutely beautiful. No.. Let me go.. Let me go.. 'We will be ruined. Everything is ruined.' 'Sonia! Sonia!' 'Sonia! Sonia!' In Pushkar, there's a fair of camels every year. That's where we were going. My entire family used to stop at the station only for five minutes. My sister had not eaten anything since morning. So, I got down to buy something for her. But it was so crowded. I couldn't find my compartment. It was a gang of four men. They grabbed me. Fucking rascals. I was too young. I was younger than you are now. When I reached Mumbai I used to find anyone noble who would save me from these demons. That's when I found Faisal. He used to behave as if he was born to help us. He used to speak to us like a father. He took care of me. But one day, he showed his wild side. It's clear.. Go, dear.. Hi! Glad you found it. Come on in, please. I was just making some coffee. Would you want a cup of coffee? I can make some hot chocolate. I have a bar. I don't know if you drink alcohol. I can give you something harder. - What? No.. - Are you okay? Okay! Come, let me show you around. You may want to watch your step here. It's a little steep. - No.. I have a swimming pool. I don't know if you like to swim. This is the living area, for just hanging out. If you want to see the balcony.. There's a nice balcony out here. I'm sorry that the view is so shitty. What do you think? It's so bright. The earth is shining brighter than the sky. I'm sorry, I don't.. Are you cold? Do you want to go inside? There's a nice fire. You look chilly. You look chilly. Chilly.. Come on, let's go inside. It's okay.. 'My dear Sonia.' 'I have been searching for you.' 'I went to the market in Mumbai where prostitution takes place.' 'I didn't find you there like always.' 'Where have you gone, Sonia?' 'I miss you every day.' 'If I find you, I'll take good care of you.' 'You are my butterfly..' - No.. You're not in trouble. It's okay, sit down. I don't mind.' It's okay, sit.. I didn't know you did email. I'm a big emailer. Yes, email.. Yes, it's amazing, isn't it? Being able to talk to people when you're not actually talking to them.. You can get whatever you want with the click of a button. It's.. It's fucked up, that's what it is. Do you have one of these? Come on, every girl has a phone. Even 11-year-olds are sexting each other in middle school. You really don't have a phone? This is a problem. Hello! You almost smiled. This is a year old. But it still has a touch ID which is great. You're going to place your thumb here and it's going to recognise your thumb print and only you'll be able to access this phone. I don't really need it. So.. This is for you. Take it. This.. Take it, it's a gift. Okay! Your friends are coming soon. 'What are you doing? - Will you be my girlfriend?' Are you okay? Hey! Amar. Sonia! Sonia! She slit her wrist. We'll handle this. Hey! Sonia! Anything? No! She couldn't be far. We need to check that way. Excuse me! - Get your hands off me. I'm sorry.. Are you okay? Hello, Sonia. I am Salma. This is a non-profit organisation called Cast. We're here to help girls in your situation. Sonia, my name is Jia. Her name is Salma. We work for an NGO. We work for girls like you. I'm really sorry this happened to you. It's not okay and it's not your fault. Whatever happened to you was not right. You are a very brave and courageous girl. You are very brave. You're doing great. Just take your time. They burnt my legs when I didn't do something they wanted me to do. They said they'd hurt my mom. I called my mom and told her.. When she didn't listen to them they used to burn her legs. That's really good. Who would like to share next? Sonia! It happened so quickly. It happened so fast. But it's clear.. She gave up her life for me. But she killed herself for me. I.. I was very scared. Very much. It made her very afraid. But.. But I felt, I.. I.. But it also made her feel like she was.. Worthy.. She's saying you're worthy.. I was worthy of it. Worthy.. Sonia! Come on! Come! 'Hello, Sonia! How are you?' I'm fine, sir. 'Look who is here to meet you.' 'Talk to her.' Preeti! 'Sonia!' Preeti! 'How are you?' I'm fine. 'I thought something bad happened to you.' 'I was very scared for you.' Is it so? Are you so worried about me? 'Sonia!' 'You saved me.' You are my world. 'You too.' 'I miss you a lot.' 'Come back..' Yes! Ma'am, I want to meet Preeti. I want to go home. Yes! - I want to meet Preeti. - Okay.. We'll try.. We're working on it. Am I right, Manish? 'Yes!' 'Sonia!' 'Look at me..' 'I look like an ox. I look so ugly.' No, dear. Who told you that you look ugly? You look like my angel. Trust me! You look like a queen. 'Come soon.' I found my sister. I've never been happier looking at anybody before. Where is Preeti? Has she gone somewhere? She left, Sonia. Where and when did she go? She went back to her addiction. She couldn't bear the struggle of living a normal life. Unfortunately, a lot of girls do this. Where has she gone? Has she gone to her boss? We don't know where exactly she has gone. We searched for her there. We searched a lot of places. I will find her. Yes, Sonia. But she can be anywhere now. - So? She is my sister. I will find her. Sonia, you also need help. What will be your answer? I'm fine.. - What? - I'm fine.. Very good, please write. Sonia! Hold this properly and hold it tight. Hold it like this. Sonia! Mom! Sonia. Take care.. Let's go.. 'Dear Preeti..' 'Why did you go before I could come?' 'Do you know how much I miss you?' 'I can't even tell you.' 'But I am not alone.' 'There's someone else who wants to meet you.' 'I'll tell you the name of the person when we meet.' 'You know, all of us are looking for you.' 'Mr. Manish and I stay here with some more girls.' 'Now this is my home and they are my family.' 'Everything can start afresh, Preeti.' 'You might not believe it but it's true.' 'You don't listen to the people who are around you.' 'They'll only tell you something that they're benefitting from.' 'But this time, you fight against everybody for my sake.' 'Please come back.' 'Every day I feel you will come back.' 'But I cry when you don't come.' 'But next day, I become strong and wait for you.' 'Mr. Manish and I won't stop.' 'We'll definitely find you.' 'We'll bring you home.' 'You are very beautiful.' 'You look like a queen.' 'You are worthy.' 'I found you once, now I'll find you again.' 'Hey, mamma's girl..' 'You know me.' 'I won't give up.' 'No matter what..' 'Sonia!' '...I will find you, Preeti.' 'You wait and watch, Preeti.' 'Love Sonia.' 'Preeti!' "Don't want to play this game." "Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide" "no shoes to hold my weight and I'm falling." "But I can't let go, I won't let go." "I have broken through these walls." "I'm open now, but I still fall." "Or will it end if I run from it all?" "Because it matters, I hope it matters." "Do you know that I am more?" "I am more than what they see. - This world is your oyster." "Sonia, what do you need? - My dear Sonia.." "Sonia, what do you see? - This will pass too." "When I'm down, I see your face." "When I think of all the days." "When love is more than what we need" "and this life is more than just deceiving." "That's far away." "Therefore, I believe the stars don't stop shining." "All the stars are with you." "We have the same colour." "All the stars are with you." "Do you know that I am more?" "I am more than what they think. - The world is your oyster." "Sonia, what do you need? - My dear Sonia.." "Sonia, what do you see? - This will pass too." "My wishes.." "My freedom.." "My wishes.." "Sonia, you can fight any battle." "Still the thunder comes at night. - Sonia!" "And the voices of the night. - Oh, Sonia!" "The earth is shining brighter.. - The world is your oyster." "...than the sky." "Do you know that I am more?" "I am more than what they think." "Sonia, what do you need?" "Sonia, what do you see?" "Sonia, what do you need? - My dear Sonia.." "Sonia, what do you see? - My dear Sonia.." "Sonia, what do you need? - My dear Sonia.." "Sonia, what do you see?" "Sleep, my darling.. Sleep on the red bed." "Mom and dad will be coming. They'll bring red toys." "As you are playing, if you feel hungry" "and there are no peanuts.." "I'm not your grandfather." "Your grandfather has gone to Delhi." "He brought two cats from Delhi." "One of the cats left." "I will cut your nose." "We saw a policeman with yellow uniform and black shoes." "He had a belt on his hip and a stick in his hand." "He was the first man whistling." "The thief couldn't steal." "We saw a policeman."
