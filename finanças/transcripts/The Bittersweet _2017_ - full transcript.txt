[heavy breathing] [eerie music] [heavy breathing continues] [Xiu Xiu] Xiao Ma... [suspenseful music] [door opens] [background music playing] [truck door opens] [background music playing] [worker 1] Excuse me, please. [worker 2] I'm in a rush, let me go first. [worker 1] Go, go, go! [background music continues] [worker 1] Xiao Ma! Here, this is yours too. [cars honking] [people shouting] [slapping sound] [brakes skid] No parking here! What's your problem? Hey, you! [woman] Courier... I won't sign until I've checked it. Open it for me. Be careful! [cutting the box] It's cracked! Look, it's cracked! Did you break it? I'll complain to your company! I won't sign. [door slams shut] You courier kids... just make trouble! Hey, I'm talking to you! Are you deaf? Ever heard of manners? What are you staring at? Clear off! Shit! Clear off! [worker] Pass it! [television commentary] [all cheering] What kind of play is that? The Koreans keep cheating! China's turn! They're attacking! Goal! 2-1! Smash Korea! Where's the defense? [cheering continues] Just one kick! [worker] We win! What happened? How come? Is it a blackout? Don't think so. Is it the TV? [worker] So disappointing! [whipping sound] [screams] [screaming continues] [background music playing] [phone rings] Please wait a moment. [tears paper] Hello. [woman] Whose child is she? She'll fall! [people shouting] [brakes screech] Isn't anybody home? [motorbike approaching] [woman 2] Someone save her! [child] Help! [woman] Whose child is she? She'll fall! Isn't anybody home? Careful! Hang on, child! [child] Help! [child shrieks] [woman] She's alive! Call an ambulance! [people shouting] Don't be afraid, help is coming! [ambulance siren] [nurse strains] [doctor] Young man, where do you feel pain? Here. You may have dislocated your shoulder. Prepare for traction. [nurse] OK. [ambulance siren in distance] [phone rings] [courier man talking] [nurse 1] OK, thank you. [nurse 2] What is it? [nurse 1] I don't know. The newest mobile! -From your boyfriend? -Yes. [nurse 2] Very nice. [nurse 1] I almost forgot, it's my birthday tomorrow. -Really? Happy birthday! -Thanks! [nurse 2] Going out to celebrate? [nurse 1] We haven't decided yet. Mum, my tummy hurts... I'll help you to the toilet. Get up. [strains] Meimei! [pressing emergency switch] Doctor! Doctor! -Meimei! -Alright, we're coming. Doctor... Nurse! -Look at Mum! -Call the doctor. [nurse] Please stand aside. -Doctor, please save my girl! -Give her oxygen first. [Doctor Lee] Family members please stand aside. [Li Ma] No! She just said her tummy was hurting! -Monitor her heart! -OK. Intravenous drip! [phone rings] [nurse] Sorry, you can't enter. [suspenseful music] [heart rate monitor beeping] [phone rings] [monitor beeping faster] [heart rate monitor flatlines] [footsteps approaching] Doctor... Mrs. Lee, I'm sorry. We tried our best... but we lost her. I'm so sorry... we did all we could [mother crying] [mother wailing] My girl... [suspenseful music playing] [cell phone rings] [courier manager] You're such a hero! You help everyone except yourself! You don't answer your phone and ignore your deliveries... A hero like you should be a cop! Why be a courier? Sorry. [mouse clicking sounds] [water dripping] CHURCH FLYER [mysterious music playing] [sighs] [singing in Chinese on the radio] How can I help you? [nurse] What do you want? What do you want? [nurse] Call security! [security] Halt! Who do you think you are? [mother screams] No cameras allowed! Get her out! Get her out! -Get your hands off me! -No photos! -Don't touch me! -I'm not! Don't be troublesome! Let me go! Where do you think you're going? Get her out! Give me back my child! Give me back my child! Give me back my child! I have no more reason to live without her! [Doctor Wang] Doctor Lee and I were on duty that day. The Renal Clinic called me I was with a patient in ER at the time. So, I left Doctor Lee to look after the little girl. I urged her to report back to me and let me make the final decision. I was still worried, so I visited the little girl myself. There was no immediate danger, so I went back to ER. Doctor Lee, did you report to Doctor Wang as he asked? Yes, Principal. Doctor Wang, I did recommend immediate surgery for this patient. Yes, and I asked you to proceed to surgery. But, that was two hours later. Principal, I followed all procedures. Acute blood loss leads to trauma, sometimes easily discovered, but sometimes not. [Principal] What was the problem in this case? A wrong decision! Surgery should not have been delayed. Delay was not the issue. Doctor Wang, are you contending that this is my sole responsibility? [Principal] Enough. I want both of you to file detailed reports, then we'll discuss it further. Are you alright? Do you remember me? Sorry I tried my best. You remember me? I couldn't save the child. [sighs] She wasn't... I'm not her family. You're not her family? No, I broke her fall. [cell phone rings] Excuse me, I need to leave. Sister Xiuxiu... Punch him! Keep it up! Punch him! Zhang Jian! On your feet! [referee] One! Two! Three! [woman] Punch him! Punch him! Go! Go! Go! Go! Zhang Jian! Zhang Jian! Are you OK? Stand Up! Zhang Jian! Stand Up! Zhang Jian! Zhang Jian! Stand Up! Zhang Jian! [crown clapping] [woman] What do you want? Is she the reason we broke up? What are you doing here? [Zhang] Are you here for a fight? I don't want to fight with you. Why didn't you take my call? Why did he need to take your call? I texted you. You can't solve problems through texting. Can't we talk face to face, Zhang Jian? [woman] Everyone texts, what's the problem here? Shut your mouth. I have the right to speak! [Doctor Lee] Not here, you don't! Bitch! Then neither do you! This is none of your business! Enough! Zhang Jian! [glasses clanging] [jazz music playing] Miao Xiuan... I knew it was you. Let me introduce... This is my colleague Ming. Nice to meet you. You alone? Let's keep you company. You don't mind us joining, do you? Come on... [man] How can a pretty girl like you drink alone? [sighs] You're still OK? [Miao] Cheers again! -Cheers! -Look at you... Cheers! Can we chat as well as drink? Again? Ming, I should have told you... Our Miao Xiuan is a strong drinker. Am I right? You! And you... Drink up! She's telling you! Cheers! Cheers! Too many people here. [man] Shall we go somewhere else for a chaser? Let's go. What? Where are you going? Washroom. Don't be long, don't leave us waiting. Drink up. [toilet flushing] [tap water running] You're drunk! -Let us take you home... Be careful. -No... [man] Come on... [Miao] I don't want... [man] You'll soon be home. Don't worry, we'll get you home very soon! [man] Hurry up! Key! Hurry up! [Ming] Coming! [man] Here we are, home at last! Me first, close the door! [screaming] [wailing in pain] [breathing heavily] [whimpers] [groans] [gasps] [singing in Chinese] Don't go! Don't leave me... [vomiting] [eerie music playing] [Miao humming] [door opens] [door closes] Tell me, why? [Zhang] No reason, I'm tired. I don't get it, you said you'd wait five years for me. You have time, but I don't. So the problem is I didn't treat you well enough. No, you're good, I'm the problem. Zhang Jian... Do you know how selfish you are? Just one more year, then I'll be promoted... First it was university... then internship, and now it's promotion... You have so many excuses. You know how much I've put into getting this far. Am I wrong to try to improve myself? You've never loved me, have you? Zhang Jian, don't force me. [slams keys] I will never force you again. [sighs] [thunder rumbling] What's wrong with you? You're bruised. An accident. [cell phone rings] AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY Hello? That's my phone. May I know who you are? Hello? Hello? Will you return my phone? Sure. Where can I meet you? I'll come to you. OK, thank you. I'll send you my office address. Good. [laughs softly] Girlfriend? [humming] [cars and trucks honking] [humming continues] ♪ Can everything really be so magical? ♪ ♪ When I close my eyes, you fill my mind ♪ [Sister Xiu Xiu humming] [screaming] [boy] Hey! Caught in the act! How dare you peep at Sister Xiu Xiu! [crying] Lousy Korean halfbreed... I'll dig your eyes out! Stop fighting! What's going on here? Should I call Lao Xu? Sister Xiuxiu, Xiao Ma was peeping at you! Get back to your homework, you two! Korean halfbreed... Sister Xiuxiu, I'm sorry... Just go back to your room. Doctor Wang, why must I shoulder all the responsibility? Isn't this a good solution? [Doctor Lee] It's not fair, I can't afford to pay $200,000. [Doctor Wang] Then how do you want to proceed? [Doctor Lee] You have to take at least half the responsibility. Doctor Lee, you're a smart woman... [Doctor Lee] What are you implying? I hear you've broken up with your boyfriend? You know why you've made so little progress in all these years? You must know that I appreciate you. Doctor Wang, please come straight to the point. [Doctor Wang] You'll have to pay something. [Doctor Lee] How is the patient in room 3 doing? [nurse] I'll check. Can I help you? Why do you have it? You were drunk, and someone... What are you saying? They were rude to you, I saved you. What do you want? I want to have dinner with you. But I don't want to have dinner with you. You don't remember me... I warn you, don't ever follow me again. [mysterious music] [water running] [cell phone chimes] What exactly do you want? Be a bit nicer... A rich guy wants his son to have your job, he's now studying abroad. You want to force me to resign? Not at all. You've been well-behaved... Nothing bad will happen, I promise. How about the big compensation claim? I haven't asked you to pay. -I have to go. -Hey! Don't forget... You'd be nowhere today if I hadn't covered up your past. No! No what? No to your job? Don't be scared. Doctor Wang...Doctor Wang... [sighs angrily] It's not good here, what if someone comes by? Why don't we move somewhere else? [exhales] That's right! Let's go, any suggestion? Why don't you talk to the Principal first? That's no good... But you have to reassure me. I can't wait. I'll wait for you. [giggles] All right. [car engine running] [sighs] Such a regrettable accident. It's unimaginable... Doctor Lee, I have read your report. You did follow the correct procedures. Principal, it wasn't my fault. I recommended Doctor Wang to take one more CT scan. He just didn't take my advice. The Medical Association may need more time to reach its verdict. The Medical Association will exonerate you, and your future will be secure. For now, take things easy. Until the judgment is published don't undertake any surgery, all right? Thank you, Principal. You'd be nowhere today if I hadn't covered up your past. [suspenseful music playing] [suspenseful music continues] [telephone rings] Hello? I was there last night. What are you talking about? I was there when the car accident happened. Who's speaking? The one who returned your cell phone. Please stay out of my life. [slams receiver] [telephone rings] I saw you two talking in the parked car. There's a Korean barbecue restaurant close to your hospital. Be there at 8:00 pm. [dial tone] [nurse] Doctor Lee, a parcel for you. [Doctor Lee] Thanks, who's it from? [nurse] I don't know. [Doctor Lee] Thank you. [snake hissing] [Inspector Zhang] Have you been in conflict with anyone lately? No. No? Then why would anyone send you a snake? That's what I want to know. Are you afraid? [nurse] I'm scared to death! Of course... any suspicious people around recently? Suspicious people... [nurse] There is a courier boy who's always looking for Doctor Lee. Which courier company? I'm not sure. Last time Doctor Lee was mad at him. Really? How long have you known Doctor Wang? As I recall, about five years. Five years... When and where was your last contact with him? In the hospital, during working hours. Actually, we've checked his phone records. He sent you a text just two hours before his death. Did he mention anything in particular? Nothing special, just the usual work things. Did he have any enemies you knew of? I don't think so, I'm not sure. Inspector Zhang, what's on your mind? Yes, take a look at this photo. [Xiao Tian] You know, I practically worship you nurses. [nurse] Really? Why? I greatly respect the way you help the dying and the injured. Are you always rushed off your feet at work? [nurse] It's not too bad, not always busy. Someone attacked Doctor Wang just before the accident. Are you implying someone wanted to kill Doctor Wang? It's possible. Let me know if anything comes up, you can reach me directly. How should I do that? -Scan my WeChat code. -OK. -Thank you. -Thanks! Xiao Tian... are you done collecting scans from beautiful girls? You can add me to the group chat tomorrow! Let's go. Please have a seat. I've ordered a set for two. This place is quite popular... Listen, probably there's some misunderstanding between us. Do you like this food? Don't change the topic, what do you want from me? Last night in the car park, I saw Doctor Wang harass you. So? What business of yours is that? I have to protect you. Sister Xiuxiu, I'm Xiao Ma. Don't you remember me? You got the wrong person. Sister Xiuxiu, do you still remember Lao Xu? I'm telling you, I am not Xiuxiu! If you keep stalking me, I'll call the police. [suspenseful music playing] [eerie music playing] Zhang Jian... I want to see you. [eerie music continues] [Xiao Ma exhales] [knocking on the door] What happened? Are you OK? It's fine now. [suspense music playing] Stay with me tonight. [background music playing] [shouts angrily] [suspense music playing] [spooky music playing] [breathing heavily] [whimpering] [suspenseful music playing] [floor cracking] [screams] Why are you hitting me? [groans] Stop right now, or I'll fight back! Are you insane? [Xiao Ma screaming] Are you going to stop? Stop! I say stop! [groans] [glass shatters] [melancholic music playing] Turn around. [man giggles] Once more. [man] Here, I promised you this for a new dress. Tell uncle if it's not enough. [Xiu Xiu sighs] [crying] [man] Come out! What were you doing under the bed? [wailing] [Inspector Zhang] Young man, where is your manager? He should be there. Who is the manager here? That's me, how can I help you? I'm from the police. I see. Let's speak over there. Please take a look at this photo. Do you recognize this motorbike? It looks like Xiao Ma's. Can I have a word with him? Xiao Ma hasn't shown up for several days. He quit? He didn't say, but his phone is off and we can't get hold of him. What kind of guy is he? Hard worker, though he sometimes makes mistakes. He's a good kid, overall. Anything out of the ordinary with him recently? No, not really... What's happened to him? Nothing... His mood has been a bit off recently. Do you have his address? Yes, just a minute. Thanks. Doctor Lee, the report exonerates you. Principal, what about the compensation payment? No need to worry about that, we'll sort it out. We're still looking for the right person to take Doctor Wang's position. Can you be his temporary replacement? Can you do it? Principal, I don't think I'm qualified. I recommended you. You have been working here for many years, you've shown your potential I prefer to work with someone we know. I'd rather not bring in an outsider. Think of it as probation period. [suspenseful music playing] [knocking on the door] [suspenseful music continues] [radio blasts music] What are you doing? Lao Zhang, look... Lao Zhang, mind your belly. Shut your mouth! [spooky music playing] [Xiao Tian] Xiao Ma! [Inspector Zhang] Don't run! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Don't run! Stop! Stop! -Stop! -Stop! Stop! Stop! Hey! You can't just run away! [live music playing] [cell phone rings] Hello Inspector Zhang. -It's very noisy here, hold on a second. -OK. I need to let you know that Xiao Ma is on the loose. What? What are you saying? I said, Xiao Ma is at large, so be careful. The courier boy? So what should I do? By the way, Doctor, how do you know I am talking about the courier boy? As you said, it must be the one in the photo! But how do you know the courier boy is Xiao Ma? I do not know him. I told you there was something suspicious about her. Don't flatter yourself! I knew what I was doing, linking with that nurse on WeChat. You just got lucky. [smirks] Murderer! How did you like my gift? [Doctor Lee screams] [crying in pain] Give me back my child! [Li Ma shouts] Sister Xiuxiu! [moaning] Sister Xiuxiu... Sister... [screams] It's OK. [thunder roaring] [wails] That hurts? No... [breathing heavily] Why were you still following me? I want to protect you. That's why you went for Doctor Wang? If you protect me, who'll protect you? You know the police are looking for you? I am going to leave tomorrow. To where? Don't you remember? To Korea. Let's go together. What about my job? You don't need to work, I'll look after you. I... like you. [tap water running] Turn around. Bear with it. [screaming in pain] All right! Give it to me! [mysterious music playing] I took it from Lao Xu's body. Have you ever told anyone? No. It can be our secret. I'll never hurt you. [romantic music playing] [sighs] Sister... don't abandon me again. [whispers] How could I? [romantic music continues] I want to stay with you because I have to protect you. [Doctor Lee humming] Sister Xiuxiu... it's as if we're back to the way things used to be. -Give it to me. -No! Where did you get the knife? He treated you badly, I want to kill him, I want to protect you. [continues humming] [suspenseful music playing] [door opens] [drops tin box] [background music playing] [ruffles through the papers] [slams box on the table] [Lao Xu sighs] Here! Here! [Xiu Xiu whimpers] Enough? [shouts] Enough? [softly] Here! Here! [screams] No... Women are all the same! [falls to the floor] [suspenseful music playing] Don't leave... I won't call the police... [Lao Xu choking] [sighs in pain] Sister Xiuxiu... Sister Xiuxiu... [background music playing] The knife! Don't run! Xiao Ma, Xiao Ma, stop! Xiao Ma, don't run! [Inspector Zhang] We're going to the police station, don't run! [Xiao Ma] You know nothing! [Inspector Zhang] I know, I know the whole story. [Xiao Ma] I don't believe you! [Inspector Zhang] Xiao Ma, Xiao Ma! Tell me what you have to say at the police station! I'll listen to you carefully. [Xiao Ma] I want to see Sister Xiuxiu... Who is Xiuxiu? Tell Sister Xiuxiu to come here! Calm down, calm down! She betrayed me! Sister Xiuxiu... Calm down, Xiao Ma! -Sister Xiuxiu... -Xiao Ma! Xiao Ma! [Inspector Zhang screams] [mysterious music playing] [sad music playing] [staggered breathing] [singing in Chinese] Sister Xiuxiu... [shouts] Sister Xiuxiu... -Sister Xiuxiu... -Xiao Ma, run now! Sister Xiuxiu... [dog barking] [tires screeching] [car crashes] [guitar music playing] [singing in Chinese] Subtitle translation by: Shirley Song
