I was faithful to him. Bore him a son. Jim. Colette climbed the stairs his only truth and falsehood in place, onovremenno where she lost and found. Quiet like a wounded bird, which ceased to fly and sing after as it was forced to fly through the storm. Was weak and strong. I thought that it was a last second to the last man. We joined the lowest and highest floor of the truth. We stood there, and I had the feeling that we stand in the tunnel between life and death. Finally we came to the release, although short-term, because nothing human, but death, not eternal. Love it as a second, when people likened to the stars, the sun, flying birds. Thank you, Colette.
