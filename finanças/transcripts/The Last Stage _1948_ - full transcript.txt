THE LAST STAGE SCREENPLAY DIRECTED CINEMATOGRAPHY ART DIRECTION SET DECORATION PRODUCTION MANAGER STARRING THE PRISONERS, THE SS MEN AND SS WOMEN, GUARDS AND BLOCKSENIORS ARE PLAYED BY THE POLISH ARTISTS AND BY INHABITANTS OF AUSCHWITZ. THIS FILM IS BASED ON AUTHENTIC EVENTS WHICH REPRESENT A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TRUTH ABOUT CONCENTRATION CAMP IN AUSCHWITZ. WE REMIND, THAT IN AUSCHWITZ 4.5 MILLION PEOPLE FROM ALL COUNTRIES UNDER THE NAZI OCCUPATION HAVE BEEN MURDERED AND EXTERMINATED. I can't stand it any longer. Get up! You're tired, aren't you? A few kneel downs will bring you to order. - Blocksenior! - Down! Up! Down! Up! Down! The whole block has to stand for punishment. Tell the Russians and French to thank the Polish girl. Yes, madam! You bloody cow! L'll show you to stand in my block! Don't you see she can't stand any longer? But she will stand, even if she was to die. And all of you too! Don't you dare to move... or l'll break your bones! L'm freezing. Did you hear all the Polish women won't get bread today? Did you hear or not? I did. How many Poled do you have on your block? 121. So, how many breads? 31 rations. You may take one ration, but... bring the bread here. What are you looking at? Put the fre on! Not now, you idiot! The boots! Damned life! Boring to death! Bring the Gypsy girl in. Let her sing. My dear... l've born fve children. Believe me, it's nothing to be afraid of. I can't stand any longer. L've heard it's even better to stand. Cheer up! Soon it will be over. Did you hear the latest news? 3000 English parachutists have landed in Hamburg. The British announced an appeal, that for every killed Pole they will kill 100 Germans. Hey, guard, come here! Go and tell Elza that a woman here is going to give birth to a child. Is it important? Go and tell her yourself. Elza's listening to the music. You shouldn't disturb her. I don't like to get a slap! Quiet, quiet! Don't cry, you fool! What for to give birth in a camp? What did she say? Eugenia, Ann! L'm glad you are here. Perhaps you can do something to help her. What happened? It's the last moment! What happened? Blockstrafe. Elza block. Block number. A woman... You understand? There's someone ill in Elza's block. A woman is going to give a birth. Careful. Take the stretcher. We're going. Nadia, arrange some water. Prisoner no. 13343. The sick woman is in the camp hospital. - You know whom I mean? - I do. This bloody cow. - Anyway, she'll die. - Stop it! What do you want? It's none of your business. L'm the blocksenior and I know what to do myself. Remember, one day you may be ill and also die in the hospital. Be careful, or l'll go to my senior and report you're against the Germans and you deal with the inferior races. Don't forget to report about the gypsy and all the other affairs... You don't understand jokes. I just... A suggestion. The whole block returns to the hunts at once. All right... l'm going, if you do care... Shit! Wait until I catch you doing something else than listening to a gypsy. If you ever again complain to these monkeys from the hospital, you'll go out through the chimney! Clear out! We haven't got bread! What a healthy baby! It will live, isn't it? Maybe we'll manage to keep it alive. What do you think, Anna? Anyway, we'll try once more. Give it to the mother. Careful. It's a boy. We have to prove to this devil, that our child can live in the camp. And if we don't tell him about the child and wait a few days? It's not so easy. The last time he gave order to kill the mother. And if we tell him that the mother died when delivering? All right. Get out! All get out! Quickly! Marta, where are you? L'm here! Where are we? You'll see they'll kill all of us! Don't worry, mum. Don't tell such things. If they wanted to kill us, they would take us to a forest. Hand over your belongings! Hauptsturmfurher, I report the new transport of 2.500 Jews is being unloaded. There's no need... to be nervous. There's nothing to be afraid of. Just follow our orders! He says we shouldn't be afraid and do what they want. We must part... As there is not enough room for all in this camp. 'I promise you, that soon all of you'll meet'. What did he want from you? L'll work as an interpreter. Mum! Mum! Prepare the documents and valuables. The frst and the second name. The documents. Quickly! Take off the ring. Take off the watch. Take it off! Next one! First and second name! Where is the new interpreter, who arrived today? It's me. You'll keep your hair and get civilian clothes. Come here! No! 107... 108... 109... 110... Where is the new interpreter? Roll up your left sleeves! Tattoo the numbers! Come on, l'll show you the way to the block. What's this? A man? A muselmann on the electric wire. A muselmann? Don't ask stupid questions. A muslemann is a woman, who can't stand it any longer. What is this factory over there? A factory? It's a crematory, where people are cremated. Now those, who came here with you. Did you have a family? It's nothing. One day we'll all go through the chimney. We'll meet together again. 3.448 women in the hospital... 323 dead... 5 cases of typhoid... Only 5? Yes, 5. But there's no water, soap, medicine an linen. The epidemic will break out in the camp. - L'll be dangerous for all of us. - You mean, for me, too? The epidemic doesn't distinguish between nationalities and races. By the way, why are you here? L'm a communist. I see... Is that all? Yes. Anything else to report? No, nothing. Come with me. You too. Eugenia! The medical officer is coming with Anna. Hanka, Nadia! Bring the child to the dead woman. All right. Eugenia told me to do it. Everybody on their places! Quickly! Hurry up! Where is the mother of a new born child? She died. What happened to the baby? The baby's all right. Show him the child! L've worked in the Leningrad Hospital for 15 years and l'm sure this baby can live... But it may be an idiot or an criminalist... The child is healthy and it may live. We can't let him be a criminalist or a murderer. The child can be an idiot or a criminalist. This child can't become a criminalist or a murderer, like him. What? The child shows no signs to become one. Tell her to bring it to the ambulance. - Let me go! - Eugenia! Have you seen Bronek? Bronek's very upset. Who's next? Wait. Girls, I have some important news. What happened? Come in. Eugenia... I came to see you... It's fne. She'll stay with us. Go! Sit down. Read this. The Nazis villains... covered Europe with gallows and concentration camps. They made Europe a prison of many nations. Listen! They know about us. And they call it a 'New Order in Europe. We know this order. Just look through the window. Continue. We know the doers of these infamous deeds. Their names are known to tens of thousands tortured men. Let them know, that they will not escape responsibility for their crimes and avoid the punishment of the tormented nations. Long live the liberation of Europe from Hitler's tyranny! A day will come full of joy for us! Stalin. Stalin! Due to the rapid and victorious progress of our troops on all the fronts, new transports from Poland, the Netherlands, Norway and France will come to our camp. Only from the eastern territories we have to take about 20-25 million. As you know, various experiments have been made, including crematory and gas chamber, to bring down the time and the cost of extermination. Just a moment... I presume, you intend to solve the problem by one way only, a brutal extermination. Are we barbarians? Don't forget, that due to the immense extension of our battle lines there will be a shortage of manpower in our factories. The transports of prisoners, which you send directly from trains to gas chambers, contain 70% of people ft to work. If you exterminate them immediately, your only proft is their personal belongings. But if you look at the matter from different point of view, our factories may gain a sufficient manpower. Gentlemen... I see, that you don't realize the importance of the task the Fuhrer entrusted our camp with. That's the great task... frst of all... to clear Europe from all racial and political inferior elements. The only way is extermination. I don't understand all this mess about 'ft to work' or not, about Jewish or not... My dear lady... Politics is done by the Fuhrer and you have nothing else to do, but to obey. The new gas chamber provides room for 1.200 people. And with the new improvements, we'll save 10 minutes in comparison with the time required up to now. Will it be possible to cremate all the people from the gas chamber? Unfortunately, not yet, my dear lady. I promise, that very soon you'll be able to reach your target of 5.000 daily. The same old story. And in the meantime, we must suffer this old carrion infecting the air in the camp. Block 17. One thousand hundred thirty one. According to the roll call, in the women camp there are 36.434 prisoners. Organize for work! Get up! You lazy silly ass! She's unable to work... Are you crazy? Elza! Look! One of your prisoners is hiding here. Still alive, you dirty animal! Go to work! I wonder, what for we have in our camp gas chambers. The camp will be put in order today! Who is she? Oberaufseherin. They're going to make a 'selection'. Don't you know what 'selection' is? They will gather all together and send to the gas chambers. They won't take you. They need us. All Jewish women for roll call! Just a roll call? What's this? Oberaufseherin arrived. They're taking people to the gas chambers. Jews for roll call! Hello! Is this crematory? Is the gas chamber ready? The transport will arrive within one hour. Madam... l'm afraid to stay here. I fell well. L'll go to the camp. Everybody's ordered to gather in front of the gates. Run! Don't let anybody in! All Jewish leave the hospital at once! All Jewish out! Hospital senior, don't you hear? The hospital didn't get any order for roll call. L'm your senior! I decide! Yes, madam! Doctor... I don't know what to do... Frau Aufseherin ordered the whole hospital for roll call. Yes... And? I have nothing to say. What? Did she say so? Go and tell her to go to hell! Would you tell it yourself to Frau Aufseherin? L'm a prisoner, not a Medical Officer. I said... Listen, I say once and for all. In the hospital, l'm the master, nobody else! He sent her to hell. Form the groups of hundred! Onto the lorries! Go! Our boys... Do I look very funny? Oh, Helena, look at yourself! Your sweet-heart won't recognize you. Never mind the hair. Head is the thing that matters. Lice! Masses of them! Look, how they move. Where are you from? From Warsaw. The Pawiak Prison. - What are the news? - Warsaw doesn't give up. - What's on the front? - All right. How is it here? You'll see for yourself. Look out! The guard is coming! What is it? Line up in fves! In fves, I say! Oh, my ladies, you're not able to count to fve. Hurry up! Damned whores! Or l'll smash your heads! Line up! What are you gaping at? Is she Polish? How can she do it? Terrible. She's also a prisoner. I wonder... Where did she get such a nice jacket from? It's not a sanitarium. It's a camp. You're here to learn how to work. How arrogant these bloody Poles are. We should drive one of them through the 'chain' again. We can arrange this joke. Hey, you! Who sings so loudly! Come here! Hurry up! Bring me my cap! Commando 71! One shot down on escaping. Very good! You get three days leave. Only seven of us are left. I wonder, who's going to be the next. Urszula... Do you want some water? What do you want? I want to go to the garden... Doctor... Give me some drugs... I have a terrible heart ache... Just a moment. L'll fnd something. Eugenia, I have a stomach ache. - Helena! - Yes? Make her a good massage. Eugenia, come here for a moment. - Why do you lie on your back again? - There's no room. You shouldn't lie on your back. Lie on your side. Everything will be all right. Doctor... I have such a terrible head ache, - that I can't open my eyes. - Helena! That little girl is vomiting blood again. Let her lie on the stove. L'll be back in a moment. Put a compress on her head. L'm trying to cure people with words only. What can I do? There is 700 sick women and this... Perhaps the boys will bring us anything. - Give it those, who can't wait. - Nobody can wait. Nadia! Give it to the little French girl with dark hair. And give the little Polish girl an injection. Be careful, don't mix it up. Eugenia! Come here quickly! Have you heard it? You'll tell us later. Don't look at me. They're overhearing. Pretend you make a medical examination. In a few days, the British will make a landing on Auschwitz. They know about us. All right. You'll tell me everything in the evening. There was a secret council at the British Royal Castle concerning our camp. Lie down now. Nadia... Make me an injection. L'm feeling so bad. I can't. Please... I have such a terrible heart ache... l've got only one injection. Give it to me. I want to live. I have three children. L've left them. The youngest is two years old. If you could have seen... Those little hands - stretching in my direction. - I can't. Eugenia ordered to give it to She's promised to give it to me! She's heard it, did you? She won't hear anything. Nadia... Do you have mother? I do. Would you like her to come back from the camp? Yes... I also want to go back to my children. Nadia... Please... Give it to me... Madam... What happened? I gave the injection not to that little girl... - but to another woman. - Why? She had a heart ache... and children. Are you crazy? Who gave you a permission to do it? Are you a doctor? The girl may die without the injection. Madam... My sister is here. May I see her? Go and look for her. Thank you. - Eugenia... - Don't speak to me. Urszula! Urszula! She's dead? - Is it your sister? - Yes. It's my fault. Did you kill her? No... But I didn't give her the medicine. Do you understand? I didn't... It's my fault. No... She would have died, anyway... She wasn't able to live here... You know... When we came here... I knew that soon I would remain alone... You won't be alone. You'll be with me. We'll work together... and go home together. Attention! How many Jewish women have been selected? 812. Continue the selection, as the next groups come! In this damned camp, schnapps is still the best thing. You pretend you're on duty? He's worked very hard today and now he has to relax. Everybody, on the Appellplatz! Stop! It seems they're going to make a selection. Janitor! - All kapos step out! - Yes, madam! Kapos step out! Cut off all the entrances! Forward march! L'm not Jewish! It doesn't matter, you bitch! Hurry up! L'm ft to work! Attention! Michelle! When you get home, tell everybody in France, and all the world, how they killed me. This way, Madam... It's perfect occasion to tell everyone whatever you want. ...pray for us. Ark of the covenant, pray for us. Pray for us. Morning star, pray for us. Health of the sick, pray for us. Refuge of sinners, pray for us. Comforter of the afflicted, pray for us. Why are you so happy? Haven't you heard? German troops have been destroyed at Stalingrad. Marta! Listen, dear... The boys will be here soon with various things for the camp. Could you prevent Germans if they wanted to search the cart? Will we manage to do it? We have to! There's a phone call for you, sir! Go! Quickly! Nobody's on the phone? Probably it was nothing important. Damned bitch! Nadia, hurry up! Here it is. - Helen, they are here! - I know. Call for Anna and Eugenia. Make sure we are alone. - Hello. - Hello. - Any news? - On the front everything's OK. - Have you got the medicines? - Yes, I have. - Hello. - Hello. Listen, girls... We have to start an important work. It's necessary to have our men everywhere. You have to fnd and gather around you the most reliable women. We've started already. But it's still insufficient and you lack courage. These are your... private connections. And it's necessary... to put all this in an organized scheme. Take it! One more thing... Deny all the false news and gossips. Do your best to make our news reach everybody. Listen, Eugenia... I must get from you regular information about what's going on in the camp. Read it carefully. There's an interesting speech of Goebbels in the 'Reich'. And here is something for consolation. Take care. I have to go. L'll try to come again. Finished. No more goods. I close my shop. I must speak to you. You told me once a few bitter words of truth... I did. But, let's go. You see... It's sad, but... I had to fnd myself here to understand many things... Near Voronezh, under the pressure of the enemy, our gallant troops withdrew on the previously planned position. Why are you smiling? L'm recollecting your previous speeches. I knew how to speak. But why are you telling me all this? I know, what you wanted to say. It's the same with me. Here, in the camp, l've learned to think... Thanks to a few of my friends. Hello, Marta! You know Bronek? That's a brave man. He knows, what he wants. Frankly speaking, not always, but... In a splendid attack, we've captured 'an important strategic point near a village... Wilczy Dol. Another transport. Muselmann! Stand up in line! Or else you'll go through the chimney! Come here, boy! You'll be a stout SS Mann! Are you here to play with children or to dance? You old goat! Well, you must go to bed. Go to hell! You crematory creature! - L'd like to dance. - With pleasure. Is it true, that your family's on friendly terms with Reichsfuhrer? Yes. You didn't know it? It's wonderful! L'll also become an Oberaufseherin. Am I not young and pretty? Our life is good thanks to our Fuhrer. Thanks to the transports. You look very pretty tonight. Attention! In the gas chamber and crematory of the Auschwitz concentration camp 335 thousand of innocent people have been exterminated... In the gas chamber and crematory of Auschwitz... You're holding dancing parties but you don't have the slightest idea, what's going on in your camp! While... an International Commission has been announced to visit. Dou you know, what it means? In your interest, I advise you... to make order in the camp. The patients on the lower beds will get towels, nightdresses and bed linen. She says, that being doctors and women you should know how a hospital ward looks like. All of you will attend the visit of the Commission. That's all. You may go! These medicines should be replaced. This will be done. Move a little more. - Here's one more woman. - OK. We'll put her here. There is room for one more. Here is another place. How many are left? I don't know. I must check. How to say in German: 'This is a lie'. And how to say 'hunger' in German? It's a good moment to learn German. Listen! The English King's visiting us today! All right, you'll tell us later. He's on his way! Good morning. That's quite clear. You may rest assured. Everywhere in the camp... you'll fnd a perfect order. Come in, please... Attention! This is how the enemies of our Reich are treated. Our soldiers on the front stay in much worse condition, exposed to wind and rain. None of them has ever slept in such a clean bed. As to a medical treatment, we have the best European specialists here. This is a lie. Everything's been arranged for your visit. - They're dirty, there's no water. - What? There's no water... hunger. People die in gas chamber. Babies are murdered. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, This is a rare medical case of a violent and unexpected paralysis. It may be dangerous. Let's pass to another section. Millions of women... men... children... killed! Do you speak German? No. What's your profession? A doctor. Where did you study? In Leningrad. Who's taught you these words, you said in the presence of the Commission? Nobody. You've prepared it earlier? L've been waiting for the chance. Why? I don't want to take part in your crimes. Do other prisoners think the same? Yes, of course. In what way do you pass the news... outside the camp? I won't tell you. We'll fnd the way to make you speak. I know it. I shall not speak any more. One cold supper, please! Warm supper, please! And now? Will you answer? Will you answer? Excuse me! What happened? Why are you screaming? L've been just appointed a Chief Doctor of the ward. A Chief Medical Officer made the choice. A good looking one, dark haired, in a uniform. Will you inform all the sick and the staff, that I will take the position of the Chief Doctor in your hospital. How did you get there? Why? L've just arrived on this morning train. I got there by mistake. L'm not Jewish. But they must have noticed this mistake, as when the train stopped at the station, they called me: 'Doctor!' And when I said it was me, they brought me here. - And the other people? - The real Jews... They've gone somewhere else. - Stop it! - An idiot! Are all these... really sick? The Chief Medical Officer observed, that there're too many patients. My goodness, how tired I am! Show me the way to the doctor's room. I have to rest. Helen... What shall we do now? We shall do just the same, as if Eugenia was with us. What's the matter? We are prisoners of the war and we want to be transferred to a Prisoner-Of-War camp. Prisoners of war? Well... But... You should tell them. We have no Prisoner-Of-War Camp. Be informed. You'll understand, why we're telling you this... later... All right. Thank you. L'll see you later. Their hair shouldn't be cut. They are to wear decent clothes. All right! Give them some clean clothes. All right. As regards the quality of the goods... the Hungarian transports of Jews are the most attractive. You look great in this suit. Every day you look younger and more pretty. These are appearances. The job of a block senior isn't a pleasant one. Everybody blames me... the prisoners and authorities... Why are you so late? L'm a bit late. Good afternoon. You can't really get out of that damned block! Anielka? It can't be! Anielka is the last remains of our transport. Come on, have a drink with us. What did you bring to us? The injections for me? I have everything. Wait. Here you are. Oh, glucose! L've got it especially for you. L've organized it for you. It's beautiful! Please, remember, what you've promised me. Nice. For you. Tell me now, what's going on in the world? When are we going to go home? I heard... that the Germans will make peace with England and together attack the Soviets. You can always come to agreement with the Germans. They will release you and you'll have a nice life. L've heard, that the Russians are going forward and the Germans retreat in panic. This would be horrible! L'd prefer to spend 10 years in the camp, than to live with the Bolshevics. L'm so tiered. Miss Lalunia! What happened? L'm so excited. L've been told such things, that nobody knows in the world. And she didn't know about it. What are you talking about? One girl told my fortune with cards. The cards? Tell me, who was it? No, I can't tell you. Please, tell me. I won't tell anyone. I promise. - Promise? - Promise. Anielka... Anielka! Miss Lalunia... you've promised! Tell my fortune, please! I can't! I don't believe you. You can. Please, I won't tell anyone! You've told everyone! What if they put us both into a starvation bunker? I have an idea. As long as I sing, you may put the cards. When I stop, hide the cards. I beg you, let's do it as quickly as possible! - Everything's all right! - Come in! Lalunia is rendered harmless. The situation is as follows. The front line is at the moment here... and we're here. - Two hours by car. - Rather three and a half, unless you speed up... After what they've done with the Majdanek, we should expect liquidation of the others camps, too. The boys me, the plan of extermination of our camp is ready. - With all of us? - No, you'll be send home. We must make them abandon this plan! The boys has been considering it for a long time. Bronek asked me to tell you, that we shall not die without fghting. - Do you understand - Yes. It's clear. We must organize the resistance, no matter... what may be the result. In a word, we shall fght, no matter what. Well... You're going to be wealthy. - Really? - Yes. - Which card is me? - This one. Oh, no. He is a man. You're here. One, two, three, four, fve... There's a dark hair man, an official... ...in a uniform. He's not frank with you. You have speak less, be careful... - Me? - Yes. I don't speak at all. Listen. We decide. Listen. We decide. Staying in touch with the man's camp... is Anna's duty... Preparing of an operation is Dessa's duty. Collecting information about the SS Manns... is Marta's duty. The rest's going to organize the camp masses. There's nothing to fear... Bring into operation as many people as possible. We must have our men in every block and Commando! Finished? Anielka! This is all. Anielka, once more, please. The cards are tired. - It was so little! - Tomorrow. - Anielka! - Just a moment! L'm coming to you. What are the news? Bombing raids on Hamburg, Lubeck and Bremen... Offensive near Rouen... And heavy fghting near Warka. The Germans are loosing. How did you smuggle it? I just did it. Why are you so gloomy today? Everybody says, the front line is near and it's going to be better and we do nothing. We're smuggling carrots. And what should we do? If we together break through the barbed wires... It's not so easy... Going out through the chimney is easier? Marysia's right. Many would die, but the majority would get through... And when our troops fnd out, they will come at once. - And if they don't? - They're already here. One to zero. Two to zero. Three to zero. I must go. Goodbye. What's going on the front line? Krystyna will tell you, l'm tired of speaking. Write it in a few copies and give it to us and everybody will be informed. Helena! This woman's getting worse and worse. How come? Didn't she get opium? I didn't get anything... She didn't... Take her. Where's Lalunia? Who the hell knows. She is never on the block in the evening. Are you sure she didn't give her any medicine? Ask her yourself! Lalunia! Come here, please! What happened? Why hasn't she got opium today? This one? Who is she? I really don't remember. So what? L'm overworked. What's the matter? - Don't play the fool. - She's a fool! You had got a drug for her. Where is it? She never gives anything. She cures only those, who are getting parcels. Which of you hasn't been examined yet? All of us. 'L'm tired', 'l'm overworked', 'The Chief Medical Officer adores me'... I don't understand, what's the matter. The Chief Medical Officer always says 'Everything's OK'. All right. Come with me! Anielka, go out. I have to speak to the doctor. Please, go. Give me all the medicines you've got. L've distributed everything. We'll see. Don't touch my belongings. It's mine! Of course... What would I need stupid medicines for? My husband had the biggest pharmacy in the town... We had a house with a garden. L've always had the most beautiful lingerie and everything. My husband adored me. He always said: 'Lalunia, you'll get everything you want'. Get off. It's mine! L've brought it from home. It's mine... The boys gave me this... to help my sick friends. You can't be a doctor here. You said, you're not a doctor, but a pharmacist's wife. They crossed Vistula near Baranow. And they crossed Vistula near Baranow. L've waited so long for such an opportunity. At last, l've got her. Listen... We don't know if it was Anna who wrote it. It's only Lalunia's speculation... She did write or she didn't... I have to settle a score with Anna... What do you want to do? Don't worry. L'll settle it properly. Elza... What's next... How to put it, that we are in such a good mood here... and we know, that the end of the war is near? Great, you're here! We have an interesting problem to solve. Oberaufseherin is calling you. What happened? I don't know. You have to go. - Anna. - L'll be back in a moment. She's furious. Number 348. You certainly know the reason why you're here. No, I don't I just want to ask you, where you take these fbs from. I don't know, what you mean. And you don't know the name of the prisoner from the men's camp, who is so well informed. No, I don't know. And what about radio news, which are widespread here? - You don't know either. - No. You damned red pack! We are still well. We're still masters! Do you know, what it is? No. Come with me! There's a spy in the hospital. They took Anna away. She only managed to say, there's a spy in the hospital. Nadia... Let Dessa know. All right. We have to remove everything from the hospital. Here is the plan... how to destroy... the Aushwitz concentration camp... Five days are foreseen to exterminate the people. Five days are foreseen to exterminate the people. On the sixth day, they want to destroy the huts, so that no trace will remain from the camp in Auschwitz. This is their plan. Some of us must leave the camp with the copies of the stolen plan. We have to hand our envelopes over to Bronek. I hope... At least one of us should get safely to the spot. We'll get there both. Here're the documents, the pass and a uniform. Finally... Tadek hasn't got here yet? He's not here yet. Did you have any troubles on the way? No. It was quite easy. Here's the copy of the extermination plan. I wish he were already here... Would you like to eat? No, thank you. Have got cigarettes? Bronek? No, nothing. Don't worry. He will be all right. Marta! It's good you're here. - Hello! - Hello! What happened? They're hunting us. Here's the plan and the rest. Well, Marta! Let's go! All right. - Do you remember the addresses? - Yes. - Do you have the money? - Yes. Be careful, my dear! If you don't succeed, you escaped, cause you fell in love with each other. Well... Good luck!

We're warning you not to take this step... How do they know it? How? If such idiots are the Camp commanders... Idiots? Yes, idiots. And you're one of them. The escape of that interpreter proves this. You're unable to be the Camp commander. Tell me, please... How was it possible? I don't know... too... Who are you? The Camp Commandant of the Birkenau. Camp Commandant? You're a corpse to be! THE UNDERGROUND POLAND SENTENCES HANS SCHMIDT TO DEATH The whole camp... must be grasped tightly! Come here! Be back! On your knee! Come here! Be back! On your knees! Go child, otherwise he'll kill all of us. Once you were an officer... but now you're only shit! On your knees! Why did you do this? I don't understand. Was it worth? He asks why we did it. Translate... Everything. He says he's sorry for us, cause we are so young. If we tell him where we left the documents, we will be free. Tell him... we know nothing about any documents. And we don't care about his promises. We shall see... The best supper for this gentleman. And you, my dear, will go next. On behalf... of the SS and Police Reichsfuhrer Himmler, Marta Weiss, a Jewish prisoner No. 14111, for a trial to escape from the camp, has been sentenced to death. This'll happen to everyone trying to violate the regulation of the camp order. Don't be afraid! They're not able to do us harm! Hold on! The Red Army is almost here! You'll be so little very soon. You won't hang me! Silence! Don't let them... Never let Auschwitz revive again... It will never revive... THE END
