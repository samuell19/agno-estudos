I WAS, I AM, I WILL BE Alterations subsequent to the application and prior to marriage... None applicable. Fine. Since no wedding oration has been requested, the question to the couple to be married is, first to the husband. If you would please rise. If you, Mr. Baran Özyakub, wish to take your fiancée here, Ms. Marion Bach, as your lawfully wedded wife, please respond, I do. I do. Now to you, Marion Bach, if you wish to take Mr. Baran Özyakub as your lawfully wedded husband, please also respond, I do. I do. The spoken word shall prevail. By the power vested in me, I pronounce you husband and wife in the eyes of the law. At this stage, a marriage is normally sealed by an exchange of rings and... a corresponding gesture of affection. Good. Very good. PRETERIT I WAS - Brother, have you got work for me? - I'm afraid not. Try down there. You alright, brother? Do you have work for me? Sorry. Try down at the beach. Good luck. Hello, brother. I'm looking for work. Are you hiring? - What can you do? - I'll do anything. Come here. Mr. Idris! This guy is looking for work. - Hello, I'm looking for work. - To be sure. - Your name? - Baran. Baran. Your age? 23. Where are you from? I was stationed in Kayseri for 18 months. Soldier? You look more like a deserter. No, sir. I completed my military service, thank God. And what sort of work should I give you? I'll do any job you give me, sir. And I learn fast. Any job? Then show me something. Sorry? Make a move. Dance? Didn't you say you'd do any job? Without music? Imagine it. If I had some music... That's it. - Cihat! - Yes? Show him the kitchen. Come along. Hey! Don't forget my plate. Brother Mahmut, how are things? Doesn't talk much, never mind. Here. What counts is that there's always enough clean crockery. And keep the rats out. - OK? - OK. The trash goes out at night. Any questions? Well then. Move it, we need glasses. Fucking hell! More, move it. Sure, go on, go on. Toilet and shower. You clean this week. And next week. You can sleep here. OK. Wow, English! Icecream? Sure. Chocolate, please. Chocolate Like you. Like you. Enough? Two chocolate ice creams, please. Hi. - How are you? - I'm not interested. - You boat-trip? - No I don't want to do boat-trip - Come on, please. - No I don't want to do boat trip! I'm not interested. - Easy, easy now. - Don't touch me, don't fucking touch me. - What's with you? - You understand? Asshole. Asshole! - Shut up, slut! - Don't talk to her like that! - Show some respect, you fucking Kurd. - She's in company. - Then step up. - I am. Help, Help, Help! Baran, Baran! Get lost. - Come on. - Son of a bitch! - Come on! Let's go! - Motherfucker! Asshole! Baran. Come in, the water is great. Tell me you love me, my hero. You have boyfriend at home? Why? You want to be my guy? "Mon mec?" I want to be with you. In France. It's Belgium, actually. I need... We can marry. You like jokes, no? Three years for the passport. And then.. Oh man, I'm out of cigarettes. Do you have any? Dear passengers, this is your captain speaking to you once again from the cockpit. We've reached our cruising altitude of 34,000 feet and are crossing over Antalya. Our flight path continues past Istanbul, Bucharest, Vienna and Prague before reaching Hamburg, where typical local weather is to be feared. I'll spare you the details until shortly before our arrival. Enjoy the steady sunshine above the clouds until then. I wish you a pleasant stay on board. The union is applying pressure again. Could be a strike. I really wouldn't mind a little raise. Oh, really? Given these working conditions? Please confirm, please confirm. Two P-M, do you read me? Comrade Co-Pilot, won't you answer? Can I get you something? Everything OK? A strong coffee for my colleague. Tea. Black. As long as he doesn't doze off. I take communication, changing to one zero seven seven five - Copy that, thank you. - Black tea. And for you? Thanks, I've had enough. Sorry. The queen of the skies! The king of weak compliments... You just hope I've brought you something. Like reliable workers? Half the team is sick. - What have you brought me? - A big bird. Got it. My wife will go nuts. Tell her to invite me when she opens her Kitsch and Crap of the 21st Century Museum. Will do. Hello. Ms. Bach, please undress from the waist up, empty your pockets and remove all metal items. I'll come and get you. Everything alright, Ms. Bach? - Here we go. - OK. I didn't notice anything except for when I got nosebleeds while jogging. There's no connection. From a medical standpoint. OK, when's the procedure? Even if it goes well, it'll take forever until it's in remission. One step at a time. You're not allowed in the cockpit, but you're allowed to fly, right? Five-star, all-inclusive, on the seaside. In Turkey. Syria and North Korea were sold out? Would you have preferred Pyongyang? Why not? Your key. Thank you. First time in Marmaris? Yes... I can do sun lotion. Sun lotion... You can do 'bye bye' I would say. Ask 'Baran'. Ba-ran. Free drinks. Marion! Ma-rion. Sell your sunglasses somewhere else, will you? Yes, darling. Ray-Ban... no, what was it? Baran, yeah? Ba-ran. Baran was just leaving, weren't you, sweetie? And... Thanks for the key. - Okay! - Okay! I take a dip and they're on you like flies on shit. He just brought us back our room key. It's a gimmick. He's a gigolo. I saw it on TV. Anything else for you guys? - Another? - No, I'm done. But a mocha would be good. Another bottle please, and a Turkish coffee. - Right away. - Thank you. I just want the bottle there as eye candy. I won't be lecturing you about healthy living. - I appreciate it. - But I don't like what I see. Well. Somethings can't be changed, like them or not. Just ask me. Don't underestimate modern medicine. - Answer it. - Later. - The view is so beautiful. - Answer it, she already tried once. Don't be a cold asshole. - Hello? - Hi. Hey, little one! You're still awake? Put your mom on the phone. Sleep well. Thank you. I left you a note on the kitchen table. Do you happen to have a cigarette? Of course. Then skip yoga for once. So this time I miscommunicated. What's the big deal? Can we talk about this another...? Hello? Maybe we should finally move in together when we're back in Germany. What do you think? "Maybe we should finally move in together when we're back in Germany?" Yeah, maybe. Scratch the "maybe." Shall we get the bill? Nice to see you, my friend. - Hello. - Hello. Marion. Have a seat, please. - No. - Not tonight. - Why? - Hey sweetheart. Stuff like this can't be unseen. It's like a car crash. I get us a drink. I make table for you. Free drinks. Baran, you can do better than that. Yes Baran, you can really do better than that. Here is your drink. - Seriously? - Yes. - What's wrong? - Bastard. See what happens? We'd better make a getaway. - What did you say? - Sorry. What? I told you three times not to give her any more alcohol. Holy shit. Take this. Raphael, I... I always liked everything being clear between us. Without any plans. I just made a suggestion. I stand by it. - Do we really have to go through this? - Through what? This conversation. We could skip it. We know how it ends. I say you're making me claustrophobic, and it makes me want to run away. Then you say, "Sure, but such an affair isn't always easy." And I say, "It's your call, your decision, your responsibility. "And just because I'm... "sick, "you think you have to take care of me, but I don't want that or your sympathy." And then you say, "You did come to me after your diagnosis." And you tell me your feelings for me and I don't want to hear that, either. Then you make that crumpled face which is... sexy, but that sadly doesn't help either. So we conclude that we both need a bit more space. Then comes your grand moment: You say, "Yes, that would be best for all concerned." Then you get up, and leave. But I don't think it would be best for all concerned if I leave now. Well... Don't forget my shoes. Marion, you're not as cold as you act. Remember to pack the other things when you've calmed back down. Please, maybe interested in shoe? - Where is he? - Back there. Germany, Deutschland? What's so funny? Not many Germans coming here anymore. Well, I'm only here for the coffee - I make you some coffee. - Yes yes, I know coffee. - The one from yesterday. - She asked for you. I'll take her if you don't want her. Man, be quiet. Don't get me wrong, I only wanted to give you this before I... ...before I leave. For me? Thank you. - That's all. - How about drink? I better go. We have coffee, good coffee. Please, sit down. Please come on. Welcome. Don't worry, the coffee is free. Thank you. Yesterday... How should I put this? She misunderstood me. It was a "misunderstanding." Misunderstanding. But now happy to see you. - Here you go. - Thank you. Best mocha you can find. Drink, please. Where is your friend? Okay. You are Marion. Marion... OK, you're Marion. You are Marion, my name is Baran. Yes yes, you told me already. Tell her you want to show her Marmaris. Okay, I make something for you. In the evening, I show you Marmaris, okay? We go, we eat, we drink. Are you disco? Am I disco? Are you disco? Yes. Yes. Thanks for the coffee. In the nine o'clock in the Atatürk statue in the 'Liman' Harbor is the word for liman. At Atatürk in the harbour. I wait for you. Won't you go eating ice cream with your little buddies instead? Yes, ice cream. Nine o'clock, okay? Excuse me. I'm sorry, I didn't order onions on the burger. - Would you mind taking it back please? - Of course, madame. Thank you. Christine, would you mind putting your phone away? We are trying to have dinner. Good girl. Brother. - You want a tissue? - No, thanks. - Two lire. - You want to rob me? - One lire for you. - Get lost. No, it's fine. Great. When will it be again? Or put me on standby if that's an option. No, Istanbul is fine, too. Sure. One second. I'm on the line. It's fine. One second. - How do you know my... - Key. I gave you key, remember? What do you want? I was Atatürk statue, you not come, you ok? Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. Unbelievable. Yes, I'm back again. No, everything's fine. You were saying? I'll call you back. Just a minute. - Can I come in? - No, you cannot come in. Are you leaving? Yes, I'm leaving, yes. Take me with you. Take me with you? I need to get out of here. - We can marry. - Well I don't think this is how it works. - Why not? - Why not? Good question. Let me think, maybe because I don't know you at all? Who are you, coming here asking me to marry you. Or maybe I am already married and you're just to late? You're not married. No ring. Oh, God! Put the passport back. In the morning when you come to bar you gave me this. But this is I need. This. Why me? Why not you? "Baran, you can do better than that." Remember? This hotel is better. This passport is better. You are better. You are better. I'm better, sure. The room is paid for another two nights, I talk to the reception, you can stay here if you like. To the airport, please. Write down this number: +491777071011 Do you have it? Yes. Should I repeat it? I have it. PRESENT YOU ARE Rapha... How long have you been here? A little while. Want a drink? You thirsty? Thanks. You know I don't like you seeing me like this. Are you in pain? Meds. Need anything? I told you we'd go through this together. I'm getting married. Could you give me the screwdriver? The screwdriver, please. Pasta's done. You all ready? Any second. Will you help me? One, two, three. - In the corner? - Right. Although... He can decide for himself later. Just put it there. Thanks. Keep the change. - Will you join us? It's vegetarian. - Thanks, but... You could invite Baran some time. Will do. And if you need anything... either of you, let us know. You could take down the trash. The picture with it? Kidding! The trash. Yes, boss. - Bye. - Bye. - Speak soon. - Right. Hello. Hello. This way. Did you have a pleasant flight? Yes. Very... First time flight. Exciting. Aufregend. You have no car? Why do this? It's rush hour, it's faster this way. And I can show you your subway station. So it's easier for you next time when you are alone. Nothing fancy, but the view isn't bad. Officially this is not your address, right? I know. 3 Gartenstr. Yes. A ticket for public transport. And a map. And learn German as quickly as possible There will be a test at the end of the three years. In case you need anything, just let me know, I still have curtains in the basement. Wasn't sure if you... You doesn't have to do that. Just let me remind you on our little deal. In the next three years your job is to do everything. EVE-RY-THING to make this mission work, yes? As soon as your shit becomes my shit, it's over. Just like... this. - No trouble. - No trouble. - No police. - No police. - No problem. - No problem. Okay. I leave now. Tomorrow 11:30 I'll pick you up. Don't be late. I was. I am. I will be. He/she/it will be. I will be. You will be. He/she/it will be. Are you our interpreter? - Özcip is my name. - Bach. - Hello. - Hello. Would you like to wear my jacket? Maybe. We can try. Thanks. You like? Sure. Bach and Özyakub? Let's do the "I do's." - Hello. - Hi. WEDDING ROOM - There you go. - Thanks. - Good luck. - Thanks. - Be seeing you. - Thanks. No thanks, I quit. Okay, what are your plans now? How about something to eat, or drink. In general I mean. I want to stay. Fair enough. Baran Bach. Well, well. Is this real gold? Make sure you wear it at all times. I will pay you back. Anyway. If you are planning to stay. You're going to need a proper job. With documents. Okay. Okay? Okay. - "Okay" what? - I will look for a job. Alright. I need to see your drivers license. License. No drivers license? I can drive a car. Those who can't drive have to lift baggage, right? He can't speak German or drive a car. - He can drive, he doesn't have a license. - I've got enough layabouts. He can come back with his license. You need alicense in Germany. How about he starts and if you can use him, he starts driving lessons? - I can't use him. Not at all. - Mark... Come with me. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Ferdi! A countryman of yours. Baran. Speaks no German. Needs instructions. - What's up? I'm Ferdi. - Hello. - Tell me later if he's any use. - Sure thing, Boss. To work. Welcome to Germany, brother. Safety first. - See the red line there? Don't cross it. - OK. Grab one of these things. All the bags land here from up there. Our job is to get the things into the right planes, alright? Take this scanner and do this. Then the bag goes on the cart. - OK? - Sure. Take this and follow me. Naturally there are regulatory time frames. But my values are fine, I feel good. Surely you can tell me an approximate time. Fine. Let's try it this way. When you're flying a Boeing, how many checklists do you work through before takeoff? "This year?" "Yes?" "No?" "Maybe?" How about a spa treatment? - Oh, God! It's your right. - Your situation is extreme. - Extreme? What's extreme is sitting around the whole time. You can feel the effect of the Tamoxifen. You shouldn't underestimate it. How about reconstructive breast surgery. - We... - It's currently not my scene. I have to tell you something. I, ah... I had... I had an operation and... God! I... I married you, right? And I think you should... As my husband, you should... Husband. Hus-band. My husband! You should be aware how your wi-fe is, am I right? Oh, should we come back later? Sorry it's not a very good moment, should we come back in ten minutes? No no, no problem. I'm Leonie, this is Johann. We are your neighbours. And we just want to say "welcome". Bread and salt. Brings good luck. Thanks. We live next doors. If ever you don't have any sugar, or anything, just come over. - Just come over. - We are free tonight. I have work tomorrow, thank you. Sure, next time. This bike, it's yours? Yeah, but it's broken. Tried to fix it but probably I'm just gonna sell it that way. This is no good lock. You see? I can repair. Well if you can repair it than you can also use it. Right? You've got a bike, dude. Go ahead. Sure take the bike, it's yours. - Really? - Really. - Alright. - Alright. See you around. See you. Bye. - Bye. How are you, my foreigner? Fine, and you? Other people maintain the planes. I'm just looking. Got repairs to do at home. - New place, I get it. - Unfortunately... Want it? May I? May or may not... We're off for lunch. On my way. Hello, ID, please. - ID? - Show me your ID. ID? Passport. Passe-Port. No ID? No? - Home. - ID. I'll besiege you until I get a date. - Old school. - I'm married now. And I'm separated. We could start a new affair. You excited to see my scars? I'd prefer that to hearing why you married a... - Help me out. - A stranger? A person in need? "Person in need?" Sun, palms, beach: I need that, too. There are thousands of other ways to help someone. Incidentally, what'll he do here? Study law? Play in an orchestra. What's the quid pro quo for the life you're affording him? Seeing faces like yours. That's priceless. That buys me a coffee. Go ahead. Anything else you need help with? Indeed. Luise's class is doing a project. They're inviting people to talk about their jobs. - I said I knew who'd be good. - Musicians have interesting lives. Come on. Kids dream of being pilots. I can get lost with my horn. I'm just not masochistic enough for that. If your refugee plan comes to light, you'll never fly again, you know that? As an ex-East German you should show more solidarity, Rapha. Fine, I won't rush to the authorities. Authorities! I'll take that as a joke gone awry. Old Stasi techniques. No coffee. - I'm taking a shower. - Shall I join you? Is that him? Tell him you're busy tonight. Speaking. Yes, I am. If you could fill me in... I see. No, that's correct. And the address is? Thanks. I'm on my way. Shut the door behind you. I'll tell my daughter you'll see if you can make it. You hear? I got a call. Bach. A missing document. Right, Bach. You are the wife? Bring Bach to the front, please. So this was an unmotivated ID check, right? We're constantly in contact with people who aren't registered in the country. It's to everyone's benefit that we check more. Sign here, please. Fine. So now we know he's registered and, yes, we are married. Hard to imagine, but... official. Let's get out of here. Did they ask any questions about us? Address. And, what did you say? I say Gartenstraûe. Your address. Anything else they wanted to know? As far as I know they don't just arrest people randomly. Maybe you don't know everything. Hm Marion? Of course I don't know everything, Baran. That's why I'm asking. You can't get involved with the police, otherwise we've got a problem. Yes sure I know. - Sure? - Sure. Okay, sure. I'm only asking, I'm trying to help here. So don't be pissed, please. And no smoking in the car please. Okay, captain. Please don't bother. Keep your shoes on, please. Something to drink? It's all yours? This was my parents place. I moved in one year ago. - Your parents? - Yes. They know...? My mother died of cancer. Krebs. And when she was gone my father didn't want to go on anymore, either So, yeah, he joined her. Joined her? Pills. And I don't mean beer. You have to carry this copy with you at all times Okay. I'm... going to get changed now. No no, this is a misunderstanding. Shit! Why are you doing this? - Doing what? - This. Everything. Why? Well, you asked me to, didn't you? Look: I want you to see, that my reasons for doing this are not selfish. Only this... I'd hope that you would do the same for me. I'll be in the kitchen. Küche. Let's have some coffee. - Marion... - Yes? How much money I get at airport? About 400 for now. - In the week? - No, that's monthly. Mark will hire you as a trainee, 'Praktikant'. Then you'll have social security at least and that's important. And how much is my apartment? A little more than 400. 400? How can I make with 400? 2000 Euro. 400 Euro. To eat, drink, transport. Baran. Baran. I'm happy that you are interested in driving lessons, and I see two options here. - You safe the money. But with your salary it will take you quite a long time to save up 2000 Euro, so... Second option: I give you the money and you pay me back later. But then you can start right away with driving lessons and get a proper job from Mark much sooner it's your choice. If you'd just sign here, please. Then we also need a First Aid course, there are weekend ones available. Plus a biometric passport photo. And an eye test. They must know, if you need glasses. Brille. Your new glasses. Unbelievable. Unglaublich, huh? Happy people. Seems so. How about you, Baran happy now? Yes, Baran happy. And Marion? "Marion". Marion happy? Do I look unhappy? Maybe you wanted something like this. Perhaps when I was six. But this, I don't even know what to say, this is more like... ...a chamber of horrors. Chamber of horrors. So, your pictures are ready. So, one of you wanted to get out at the subway. Please. Okay. - Aus Wiedersehen. - Auf Wiedersehen. Aus Wiedersehen, auf Wiedersehen. Whatever. There you are. Come in. Great you made it. Thanks, put it in the kitchen. How are you? Great. - How are you, brother? - Great, you? - Good. - Come in, we're celebrating. Celebrating. Party. No, no, brother. Thanks. Don't "no, no, brother" me. Yes, yes, yes! It's crucial. We're throwing a party in there. Come on in. Look who's here. I rang your bell to warn you. Warn you! We wanted to invite you over, Baran. Leonie finds you extremely... We had to celebrate our new household chores. Jacques, he doesn't understand you. I'd take better care of you if I were your wife. So, first aid. Great, great, great you made it. Drink, drink...! It's late. Ride a bike, don't take the bus. Take a bike. Great bike. I fixed it myself. Brakes new. Look. New wheel. Top tip. Tip-top, Baran. Look my friend... If not good, you bring me back, no problem. Great bike. Where did you get them? - Leonie? - Do you have purchase receipts? - What's the problem? - How do I know it's not listed as stolen? This is a flea market, dude. You don't get receipts for anything here. Imagine our friend having blond hair, blue eyes and being as pale as you. Just what I wanted to say. Please just let me do my work. Stop playing, please. Sure, he prays five times a day. That took some getting used to. But the headscarf debate is over for us. He lets me make up my own mind. I think they just don't suit me. Something to drink? I take care of it. Please, Marion. Let me... This place is expensive. You can invite me another time. Mrs. Bach? - Dr. Stade, what a... - Nice to see you here! Small world, huh? I saw you from the distance and thought, it really is her! Yes, it is her. - How are you? - Good. Excuse me. This is Baran, my husband. Nice to meet you. It must be nice not having your wife fly from A to B. - Great concert, huh? - Yes. Great. Baran hasn't been here long. He's learning German. But the concert was... May I introduce Gerda? My husband. - Hello. Gerda Stade. - Marion Bach. Baran... Bach. Hello. Her husband. Nice. Nice. How are you, brother? Very well, thanks. And you? Well. - You certainly look great, Mrs. Bach. - Thank you. - To health. - To health. Cheers. Rapha! Excuse us one second. One of the musicians is an acquaintance. Congratulate him from us. - Bye. - Bye. Congratulations. Great. Yes, who would have thought, that we would meet again? This is Luise, my daughter. Did you like the concert? The second part was quite modern, not everyone's cup of tea I suppose. No, I like. Headphones. Not stupid, in case the concert turns out to be a disaster The man has class. By the way, sweetie, this is the pilot who's coming to your school. I might have to cancel at short notice, but... your father has great stories to tell about his job. - Too good to waste. - Because you have a flight? No, she's currently not flying. I'm sure Marion will see you all. - I'll call you about it. - I'll give you the date and time. Because we support one another. - Right? - Raphael! - You wanted to talk to me. - Uli! I'll be right over. Excuse me. And remember to get a photo for the record. One might almost envy you two. Why don't you fly if you're a pilot? Make sure you don't lose your dad. Bye. Let's get out of here. From now on one concert every week, right? - Every day. - Every day. May I. I have to know what kind of music Baran is listening to. Now the pluperfect. I had played. You had played. He, she, it had... The pluperfect. Bravo. Captain, can I ask you something? Sure, fire away. In Marmaris. You, Raphael, me and tourist. Remember? The Campari, sorry. What did you say in her ear? Maybe I said something like... "The guy's an AIDS lizard, I hope you didn't get too close." There's no translation to that specific sentence, I'm sorry. Don't bullshit me, woman! No, no... Stay there, I don't want you. - Get on. - Let me drive. - No, no. - I'm the captain. - I am the captain. - I am the captain. I'm the captain, like it or not. Okay. - Are you ready? - Yes. SIMPLE FUTURE WE WILL BE I'm leaving now. One day I want to see you in your uniform. PILOT What does it feel like to fly? It feels great. When I flew as a child, then right at takeoff I fell asleep. Now... I don't do that anymore. That wouldn't play well. Whose question do I take next? Isn't it funny always wearing a tie? Oh, you mean because men normally wear them? Sometimes I take it off. And then tie it around my forehead They call me Rambo-Marion. Next question. Do planes also have keys like cars? No, not passenger planes. They're so large that no one steals them. Do you take photos above the clouds? Yes. Here. You can pass it around, but I'd like it back. So, next question. - Do you have a boyfriend? - A boyfriend? I'm married. Is your husband scared when you fly? I don't speak good German. Excuse me, but... I am married with Marion. That's "married to Marion." To! Damn it, Baran! To Marion. I am sometimes afraid to Marion, but only when she rides bicycle. Your husband is great. "Your steering wheel flutters as you drive." It does what? It flutters. Like a bird. What's the cause? A: The wheels are misaligned. B: The shock absorbers are worn. C: The suspension is damaged. So many difficult words. Maligned. - Misaligned. - Misaligned, yes. Misaligned. Your comprehension was good just now at school, wasn't it? "Your husband scared when you fly." That's easy. - Totally easy. - If something's not so totally easy, you have to really exert yourself. Exert. I really exert. You really exert. He/she/it really exerts. Right? You must really exert yourself. Oh, Marion, gee! I have to drink some water. You, too? - Water, please. - Hey, you butted! Raphael? Shit, I forgot my cell with the kids, huh? Yeah, Luise took it. Raphael has it now. You can pick it up before 3. Then I have to go. Want a ride somewhere? Luise said you brought Baran to her school. Does that bother you? Did you want to enroll him there? Good one. Luise liked him. - But she was confused, too. - Confused? That you're married. Old woman, young man? We've all got prejudices to work against, right? Sure. It's just strange that you make a show of it. A show? Well, what else? Or are you screwing him? Oh God! You really are screwing him! Just don't tell me you've fallen for him. Well, he is my husband. "My husband." Jesus, Marion. What contempt you'd have shown me if I'd fatherly smiled at a Thai girl when on vacation. Who is this really about? Are you helping someone? Or is this in fact all about you? And what if it is? It's my life, right? - What bothers you about that? - That I'm not a part of it. The part you played was the easiest one to replace. That was below the belt. Even for a friend. And now? Come in. Yes, come in. We're practically done here. The guy must be a sex bomb, given it was the trade he learned with women from all over the world. What would you reply? - Robbi? What does she reply? - Could I have my cell please? Where's this going? I'm deleting my contact from your life. Are you excited? I feel stress sometimes, too. If a turbine fails, say. But you just stay cool and keep your nerve. If you don't know an answer, then? - Next question, yes. - Exactly. You've got this. And then... - I'll drive your car, Captain. - Get your permit, then we'll see. Permit.Ehliyet. You'll be late. God help me. 6 p.m. Ask for Marion. Free drinks ok? You now have 45 minutes to fill it out. It's in your own interest to use the time and to check your answers if need be. Good luck. Simply tell me to contact my employer. I'll simply tell you to contact your gynecologist. Of course, but the papers I need for my job... Sorry, what was that? The concentration of beta hCG in your blood leads me to draw only one conclusion. You mean? Wait, wait, wait. You yourself said at the beginning that during anti-hormone therapy, pregnan... Didn't the Tamoxifen leaflet also say that... Mrs. Bach... As much as I wish it should prove to be the case, I have to point out certain risks. In order to protect the embryo, we have to stop the medication at once. The body's hormone production will then increase the probability of relapse. I won't hide that from you. But... if you and your husband do want a family, now is the time. Hey. Baran passed the theoretical part. Great. Really great. I'm proud of you. - A drink to start with? - Water, please. Uncarbonated. Coming right up. - So? - So. How was the doctor? Well, OK. Flying? Uniform? - Captain? - Soon, I guess. That's good news. - Right? - Yes, it's good news. Uncarbonated. And would you like to order now? Nothing right now. It's fine, order for yourself. Tzatziki, fries and another beer. Tzatziki, fries and a beer. Coming right up. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Captain, what's up? In 18 months, the three years are over. So... the halfway mark. What's in 18 month? Do you know what you want to do in 18 months when you get your passport? - No idea what'll be in 18 months. - Got any plans? - What's next for you? - No plans, Marion. As a suitcase porter. - Baggage handler! - Excuse me! As a baggage handler. You won't do that all your life, will you? With pleasure. I like baggage handling. You said with a license I could get a better job from Mark. - More money, right? - Besides the money. "Baran happy" means something else, right? OK, what's going on here? I just want to be able to plan my life. Three years, then we separate. That was the deal, right? You'll want to see things: travel again, start a family... Family? So here's something to nibble on. The rest will be right here. Anything else? Thanks, it's fine. - It's fine? - It's fine. We had a deal. Had. - But the deal is in the preterit. - The preterit. The present counts. Now. - Now? - Now. Here. Today. You and me. Restaurant. Meal. That's nice. Right? Could you call Baran? It's his wife. - Want to come in? - I actually just need a word with Baran. We're cooking to celebrate his pass in theory. - You can join us. - That's nice, but... could you please tell Baran I'm waiting here? Is everything alright? You tell me. I don't know what Baran told you, but we had a party here recently. We were all a bit tipsy. It was just an innocent make-out... For you. And these are all discarded bikes, you say? Broken. Old. Just because no one's complained doesn't mean it's alright, you know? Are you selling them online? With your name and telephone number? Leonie and Johann help. Leonie said it's OK. You like her, huh? She likes you. You're the same age. You're jealous. Take the bikes back. I don't want to have to fetch you from the police again. And I won't fetch you from the police again. I mean that. Marion. I'm not fucking her. I know. You just kiss each other. - Come with me. - Where to? To management. Leave that. Come on. Come in. Who caused the problem? I don't know. But it was one of you. - I know nothing. - Where were you going? It wasn't my shift. I don't know if it was him. Or him... Stay cool. Take it easy! Easy. Baran. Come with me. Come on. Is there video footage? Evidence? We're checking. Baggage has been disappearing. On Baran's shift, according to the lists. It seems someone's exploiting the fact that Baran's new. That's feasible, right? Do you know something about this shit, it's serious. No, I'm not involved. Baran has unlawfully removed airport property. What then? A ratchet set. A ratchet set? A ratchet set. Is that true? - I'll bring it back. - Marion, can we speak alone? - You go out. - I'm not his mother. This is no teacher-parent evening. Just speak up! We've got a problem here. Maybe because I did you a favor. Is this about me or Baran? - Do you want to fire Baran? - What should I do, Boss? Tell me. What should I do? Mark, you're free to construe it as you wish, but you're barking up the wrong tree. Up the wrong tree? Me? Maybe. - Can I tell you something, anyway? - Please do. You've changed, Marion. I'll take that as a compliment because we're old friends. I'll wait outside while you two work this out. Baran. Bar... Marion, I didn't do it. - It's a misunderstanding. - Misunderstanding. Yes. Someone's stealing bags and they say it's you. I didn't. What about the ratchet set? Repairing bicycles. Ferdi said I can have it. Don't you see what this means? Not just for you? You don't believe me. Baran. I'll be right there. Mark, I didn't do it. It's a mistake. Baran, this isn't the time, I'm going in here. Go home and we'll talk tomorrow. I didn't do it. Understand? - It's a mistake. - Baran, go home, damn it all. Go home! Sorry, I apologize. Till then. Bye. You know how persuasive I had to be for Mark to give you the job? The fuck with Mark. - Fuck Mark. That asshole. - You're apologizing to him tomorrow. Did you ask me? Did you ask me? Did you ask me if I wanted to do baggage handling? You've changed your tune. "I like baggage handling." Remember? - Well fuck me! - It was a good job with papers. - Just what you needed. - I've had it with handling! What do you want to do now? Don't worry, Marion. I don't need your money. I didn't ask if you need money, but what you'll do now. I'm not stupid, Marion. I'm not stupid. I can do everything. I can repair bicycles. Right. Go back to stealing bikes. That'll be great. What the fuck is your problem, Marion, what? My problem? Your shit is my shit, too. When will you finally get that? I am the problem. It's not always just about you. It's about my life, my existence, everything, man! And for what? A thief who'll fuck off in a couple of years anyway? I'm no thief, Marion! Understand? And you don't steal watches, either? Marion. Marion, open up. Open the door, Marion! The door, open it, Marion! Open. Marion, look... Open the door! - What's up? I'm in a hurry. - Mark, it wasn't pretty yesterday. I'd like to apologize. As for Baran, he was really upset. Like I say, he's a good guy, but management is looking into it now. It's out of my hands. He wanted to apologize. Did he? I haven't even seen him today. Be right there. Got to go. This is Baran. Please leave a message. - Not too much sugar, right? - Correct. Close the door. You've done the job before? Yes, in Germany. Baggage handling. The boss' right-hand man. - Do you speak the language? - German? Naturally. Why didn't you stay there? It's a cold country. And the coffee is bad. Got a driver's license? Friends! Friends! Get on the other side of the line. Safety first. We agreed on that, right? One colleague still has to report to me. It's about a suitcase. I'll be here waiting.
