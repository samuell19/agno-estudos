(dramatic music) (intense rock music) (audience cheering) - (clicks tongue) Ugh. (intense rock music) (crowd clamoring) - [Woman] Al, I want your baby. - [Narrator] Weird Al, the man who set the music world on fire. What's behind his incredible story? Where did it all begin? (gentle music) Lynwood, California, 25 miles to the south of Los Angeles. Nothing much ever came from Lynwood, known primarily for the manufacture of aluminum foil and nasal decongestants. For a boy growing up in Lynwood, the future seemed no brighter than the future of those before him. In fact, there was little to suggest that out of this provincial setting would come a young man and a musical revolution that would captivate and change the world. Alfred Matthew Yankovic was born October 23, 1959. He was born in the elevator on the way up to the delivery room at St. Vitus Hospital, certainly a prophetic beginning for a young man's rise to the top. Al's parents, Nick and Mary, were two simple, hardworking folks just trying to make ends meet. After a hard day sorting sprinkles at the local Dairy Queen, Mary would spend hours folding and unfolding the laundry, an activity no one could ever quite explain. The Yankovic house was a modest but happy house, where a home-cooked meal followed by a quiet family evening were the staples of contented suburban life. Outside of his son, Nick Yankovic's passion was shooting home movies. Baby Al, friends and relatives, and freeway traffic were all subjects for Nick's keen eye. These early home movies of young Al depict his flair for the theatrical and his uncanny feel for comedy. Al's seventh birthday party was to play a pivotal role in the formation of his future. His parents could never have guessed the significance of their birthday gift, an accordion. Young Al sensed the joy and wonder that this newfound instrument would bring to his impressionable life. The hours of hard work and practice with maestro Dino Zamore, his devoted teacher, would pave the way for his long and illustrious career. The years passed. It was a time of "Woodstock," political demonstrations, flower children, man on the moon, and "The Beverly Hillbillies." For Al, life at home in the sleepy suburban town of Lynwood was a simple one. Some called it simple, others called it stupid. The Yankovics would spend hours watching their favorite TV shows. For young Al, television was more than a recreational activity. It was a way of life, and would later serve as an inspiration for his music.

Al attended Lynwood High School, a school noted for its famous alumni, including Fernando Lamas, Benny Goodman, and Leon Spinks. Al was an excellent student who seemed to enjoy his studies. He took great pride in his schoolwork and actively participated in extracurricular activities. - (laughing) How could I forget Al Yankovic? He was pretty weird even back then. I remember his shop project for his electric wiener warmer. Oh, it was a real work of art. It had beveled edges, and it was brushed metal, and had Bakelite handles. And the hot dogs, they were supposed to revolve around a little aluminum carousel so they'd cook evenly. And it even had a brass tray at the bottom to catch all the natural juices. Well, when the day came for Al to try it out, he insisted on using only all-kosher, 100% beef wieners. Well, I would have given him an A, but, well, when we plugged the thing in, the power surge blacked out all the electricity in the school and (chuckling) everything else within a six-block radius. (Cafarella laughing) - Do I remember Al? He would always wear those Hawaiian shirts, and I remember one day, (chuckling), this (coughing), this is very funny. One day, the funniest thing hit me right in the middle of class. I said (coughs), I said, "Al, you know those colored shirts you always wear?" (laughing) "They remind me of the dorsal coloration of the speckled-bellied salamander." (laughing) (coughing) - Yankovic? I don't remember him. Wait, wasn't he that Puerto Rican football player? - [Narrator] In addition to his studies, Al had a very active social life. He went to movies, dinners, and dances, much like many young men his age. While his contemporaries were listening to the Eagles and Rod Stewart, Al was captivated by the sounds of Allan Sherman, Tom Lehrer, and Spike Jones. In order to earn extra spending money, Al tried his hand at a variety of part-time jobs. (Al inhales deeply) During the summer of his junior year, Al's father got him a job at the Scheckman Pharmaceutical Company as a quality-control tester in the nasal decongestant division. (Al inhales deeply) (Al thuds) But Al's favorite place to work was the local ice cream parlor.

This hallowed institution nestled in the foothills of the Santa Lucia mountain range provides an excellent atmosphere dedicated to higher learning. It was here that an eager Al Yankovic embraced academic life. He selected architecture as his field of study for its long tradition of design, aesthetics, importance to Western civilization, and, as Al himself would later admit, it was listed first in the school catalog. During the course of his architectural studies, Al's innate talent blossomed with ambitious creative designs. This daring concept was featured in the "Magazine of Modern Design," "Burgeropolis, the City of the Future." But all work and no play makes Al a dull boy. He continued to charm his way into the hearts of many young coeds, who, even then, found his natural panache and sense of humor irresistible. But even with Al's blossoming architectural endeavors and amorous adventures, his main love continued to be music. It was at his college radio station, KCPR, where his taste in music and his unusual behavior earned him the nickname that was to stick with him from then on. (record needle scratches) - All right, looks like it's gonna be another record-breaking show. You got Weird Al on the radio. Oh, it's instant request time. Hello, KCPR. You want to hear "You Light Up My Life" by Debby Boone? All right, another instant request. ♪ All right, everybody's heard about the bird ♪ ♪ Bird, bird, bird, bird, bird's the word ♪ ♪ Well, bird, bird, bird, bird is the word ♪ ♪ Well, bird, bird, bird ♪ - [Narrator] It was here, in this men's lavatory now designated as a permanent state historical landmark, that Al recorded the song that was to be his first hit. ♪ Hungry one ♪ ♪ Open up a package of my bologna ♪ ♪ Ooh, I think the toast is done ♪ ♪ The toast is done ♪ ♪ Top it with a little of my bologna ♪ - It was really a stroke of genius. Al intuitively knew that the acoustics inside that bathroom would give him the precise sound he was looking for. The reverberation of those little diamond-shaped tiles combined with the echo available from the showers was dynamically perfect. Al told me how he had searched the entire campus looking for just the right bathroom. You know, when I produced Billy Joel's "Innocent Man" album, I found several places where it was effective to incorporate the same technique. - [Narrator] It was the legendary DJ Dr. Demento who first introduced Al's music to national audiences. An avid listener since his childhood days, Al would send tapes to the doctor of his latest compositions recorded in his bedroom. Al's exposure on the doctor's radio show proved to be his big break. - And now here's the song that's been lighting up the Dr. Demento request lines, the latest from Weird Al Yankovic, "Another One Rides the Bus." ♪ Ridin' in a bus down the boulevard ♪ ♪ And the place was pretty packed ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Couldn't find a seat, so I had to stand ♪ ♪ With the perverts in the back ♪ ♪ It was smelling like a locker room ♪ ♪ There was junk all over the floor ♪ - [Narrator] This man, who thought himself to be a vibrant force in the entertainment business, recognized Al's talent and would soon become the mastermind behind his career. His name was Barry Cohen. - I hadn't really had any experience in pop management before. I'd had some degree of success with Brickman's Poodle Review and the Flying Manzini sisters, you're probably familiar with them, as well as some success marketing certain specialty merchandise, but I never really managed a pop artist before that day I went down to Mickey's Bowl-A-Rama and saw Weird Al performing. From the first moment I heard him, I knew he was gonna be a force to be reckoned with. - [Narrator] Barry Cohen convinced Weird Al to put up his own money to make a test pressing of "Another One Rides the Bus." Barry assured Al he had the right connections to make him famous. - Listen, how long have we known each other? I told you, you got to order six sets of the personalized grapefruit knives in order to get the free happy-face auto air freshener. Okay, okay, we'll talk. From now on, every customer gets on of these. I mean, you never know who's out there. So, Al, let's talk promotion. I got this plan that absolutely can't fail. - [Secretary] Barry, Brickman's here. He wants his check. - Uh, Al, would you excuse me for a moment? (dogs barking) Karl, how are you? Look, you know checks can only be issued on the 17th of the month. - I know, but Fifi needs a manicure and a shampoo, and Griselda's costume needs new sequins, you know, the little blue one you love so much. - Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. Listen, we'll take care of it. But first, I want you to meet our newest member of the little family. Karl Brickman, canine trainer, showman extraordinaire, meet Al Yankovic, king of rock and roll accordion and future music legend. (Fifi barks) - How do you do, young man? Barry, these things can't wait. The show must go on. I must get prepared for my next performance. (Fifi barking) Oh, Fifi, no, no. (Fifi sneezes) Don't do that. - (chuckling) Listen, I'll talk to you later about that gig at the Cuyahoga County Fair, okay? - What about the deli platter for my dressing room? - Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, I spoke to the promoter personally, and he assured me that the cold cuts will be fresh and the ricotta cheese is in the little triangular shapes that you like so much. - Okay. - Okay. Yeah, I'll see you later. - Don't forget. - Don't forget. - See you later. We'll talk. - Yeah. - What a nut. I love that guy. - [Secretary] Barry, your mother's on the phone. - Okay, okay, I'll get it. And get me Allan Pepper at the Boom Boom Room. Look, Al, we're gonna book a hot gig for you, an industry showcase, and when we do it, we're gonna do it right. We'll rehearse, we'll have lights and everything, we'll put a band around you. It'll be great. Hello, Mom? I'll call you back. - [Secretary] Barry, Mr. Pepper's on the line. - Watch this. Hello, Allan, how are you? Yeah, how was Gordon's bar mitzvah? Good, good, I'm glad. Listen, Allan, I got a hot new musical act that's perfect for your club. No, honest, I'm serious. Yeah, his name's Weird Al Yankovic. What do you mean, "That's too bad?" Well, he's fantastic, and he'd be great in your club. He belongs on your stage. We're looking for the right industry showcase. We're gonna pull out all the stops. So, talk to me, what do you got? He says you can open for Billy and the Scumwads. Yeah, well, okay, Allan, let's talk some serious ducats, then. How much? Oh, there must be something wrong with the line, Allan. No, I can't hear you too good. How much was that? How much? Okay, okay, as a favor to you, we'll take it. Yeah, yeah, I know he's got to pay for his own food. Yeah, okay, okay, but you owe me one, you monster. Yeah, send over the contracts. Uh-huh, goodbye. It's the day after tomorrow. - [Narrator] Barry used his natural instincts and close personal contacts to arrange auditions for Al's band. - Okay, send the first one in. (intense guitar music) Thank you. ("Day Tripper") Thank you. - No, wait, I'll get it. ("Day Tripper") - [Barry] Thank you! (intense guitar note) Thank you! (gentle guitar music) ♪ Love, I love you ♪ ♪ I've been loving you so long today ♪ - [Barry] Thank you. We'll let you know. (soft rock music) Thank you. Get her phone number. (soft rock music) Thank you. We'll get back to you. (quirky banjo music) ♪ I don't wanna do my laundry ♪ ♪ I don't wanna do my laundry ♪ ♪ Why don't you do it for me ♪ ♪ I love your lovin', baby, please ♪ ♪ Do my load of laundry for me ♪ - [Narrator] Despite Barry Cohen's efforts on his behalf, Al was finally able to put a band together. Meanwhile, Barry continued to pursue all of his record label connections, taking full advantage of his personal charm. - Al, this is a crazy, crazy business. Everything happens for a reason and in its own time. You can't have unreasonable expectations. It's like the tortoise and the hare, like the yin and the yang, supply and demand, (phone ringing) ba-da-beep, ba-da-bop, ba-da-boom. - [Secretary] Johnny Ronzoni's on the line. - Ronzoni Records? - [Secretary] That's right, Barry, on line two. (Barry clears throat) - Hello? - [Johnny] Is this Barry Cohen? - Yes, of Barry Cohen Associates. - [Johnny] Barry, this is Johnny Ronzoni at Ronzoni Records. - Johnny, how are you? How's business? - [Johnny] Yeah, yeah, listen. I just received my two dozen monogrammed golf balls. - Oh, yeah. Well, I'm glad you like them. - [Johnny] But listen, that's not why I called. This record by this Yankovic kid. What is it, Crazy Al? It has interesting possibilities. - Oh, I think so too. - [Johnny] Listen, why don't you come down to the office and bring Big Al with you, and we can talk about the tune, and we can see what we can do here. - Listen, I've been impressed with your operation, the way your treat your artists, so if we can come to terms on this, I think it would be mutually beneficial for both of us. - [Johnny] Yeah, well, hold on a second. Tell him if he doesn't like it, he's history. So, we'll see you, right? (receiver clicks) - What did I tell you? - Listen, Crazy Al, in the record business, radio has got you by the goniomes. We're on the phone here day and night with those programming yo-yos, but that's what it takes. Push, push, push, and we're the ones who do it. You know, when my brother Ronnie and me, when we first started this company, everybody said it was impossible. But we're a family here. That word, impossible, it's not in our vocabulary. - You know, Wild Al, life is like one big pizza, you know? You got to mangia. You know what mangia means? It means eat. Mangia, mangia, mangia. And you can't be afraid of taking big bites. Me, I want to eat the whole pizza. It's like that with everything. And at Ronzoni Records, our artists select the choice toppings. - Big Al? You too can be a green pepper. - I was just thinking along those lines today. Time is money, more is less, less is more. Ba-da-beep, ba-da-bop, ba-da-boom. - So, Al, how does that sound to you? Are you ready to join the roster of Ronzoni international superstars and make millions of dollars? - Okay. - Hey, hey, congratulations. - Welcome to Ronzoni. - Thanks a lot, thanks. - Hey, I'm pretty happy about this, fellas. (chuckling) How you feeling? - Oh, great. - Great, great, great. Listen, you just let me work out the nuts and bolts of the deal with Barry here. You just worry about writing those hits, huh? Listen, there's something I wanna talk to you about. - I'll be just a minute. We got something important to discuss. - Listen, you got any more of those monogrammed golf balls? I'd like to get some for some of the boys in the office. (quirky music) - [Narrator] With things starting to go their way, Barry took Al to a fashionable clothing store to begin their search for the right image for Al. After an exhaustive search, Barry had finally found the perfect look for Al. Al was looking for just the right song to start his new record career off with a bang. He needed the right look, the right artist to parody, and most importantly, his permission. (suspenseful music) (animal howling) (thunder rumbling) (snake hissing) - I, um... - Son, we've been expecting you. (thunder rumbling) (animal howling) (thunder rumbling) (wind whistling softly) (suspenseful music) (animal howling) (clears throat) - I've always been a great fan of yours. I've got all your records, and I'm very grateful for this opportunity to talk to you. Well, the reason I wanted to see you was I had this idea to do kind of a takeoff, you know, a parody of, uh, one of your songs. (tiger growling) It would all be in good fun, of course. I mean, I have the greatest respect for your work. (chimpanzee whooping) I would never- (chimpanzee kissing) I would never... I mean, uh... Well, anyway, I was just, I was just wondering how you'd feel about my doing a parody of "Beat It" called "Eat It." You know, it would be about food and what mothers say to their kids about eating tuna casserole and Spam, and I'd even try to make it sound like yours. It could never be as good as yours, but it'll be pretty good, so what do you think? (wind whistling softly) (suspenseful music) Oh, oh, oh, wow, thanks a lot! You won't be sorry. I don't believe this. This is great. Thanks again. You won't regret this. (laughing) No, no, really, this is great. I can't believe it. (laughing) (suspenseful music) Oh, I can't believe it. This is great, oh god. (Al's speech drowned out by music) (Michael growling) (Al laughing) Really, thank you, thank you so much. Who would have thought? This is great. I can't believe it. What a nice guy.

In no time at all, Al had become one of the world's most sought-after celebrities. (upbeat music) - You know, in all my years in the music business, I can honestly say I've never seen anything like the phenomenal response to Al's music. He combines the great showmanship of The Beatles with the poignancy of Dylan. He's created a kind of magic all his own. It's not the Motown sound. It's not the Philadelphia sound. It can only be described as the Al sound. - [Narrator] Al's success catapulted him to the concert stage, and Barry Cohen had his hands full arranging for a national concert tour. Al's live appearances drew standing-room-only crowds. Philadelphia, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and Toledo all played host to rock's newest superstar. Al's record-breaking concert tour culminated with 42 sold-out performances in the entertainment capital of the world. - [Radio DJ] Good morning, everybody. This is KIDB radio in Los Angeles. It's 76 degrees at 8:14 and time to get ready for Weird Al Yankovic. Weird Al will be coming to Los Angeles later tonight for his concert under the stars at the Greek Theatre.

He's, like, nature and growing. And I like to oil paint and everything. And if I could just give this to him, it would mean everything because- - Do you think you have a chance of meeting Weird Al? - Well, I don't know, because sometimes you gotta, it's all who you know, anyway, and it's luck too, and I'm a very lucky person, and I'm his biggest fan, and if I, if I could just meet him and talk to him. Because he's the beginning of everything. - Oh, it's the real thing, because the hotel manager of the Park Plaza Hotel in New York and Swingles in Cleveland signed affidavits certifying that this is Weird Al's actual dental floss that he used, what piece was used after what meal or what day. You could even see a little piece of, uh, I think it's vegetable matter right here. - [Reporter] Now, what do you plan to do with this stuff? - I'm gonna sell 'em.

(crowd clamoring) (upbeat music) - [Narrator] But even as he was enjoying the fruits of his newfound stardom, success was beginning to change Al in ways perceptible only to those closest to him. - No, success has not changed Alfred at all. - Yeah, he's a great kid, hasn't changed a bit. - You know, a lot of people let this kind of thing go to their head. - Yeah, our boy has really got his head on straight. - He doesn't really call us anymore. - Of course, he's real busy now. - Yeah, too busy to call his own parents. - This is the thanks we get. - It's not like he's being an obnoxious jerk, but... - He just acts like he knows everything. - Yes, he thinks he knows everything. That's why he went on that ridiculous game show. - Ever since he was a kid, all he could talk about was being on a game show. - Now that he's a big star, you'd think he wouldn't care about that anymore, but he went on anyway. - If he wanted a new car, he could go ahead and come to us. - We would have got him a new car. - Instead he had to make a fool of himself on a game show. - I was never so embarrassed in all my life. - We had to move. - He's down in the booth? - He's ready. - [Director] Okay, here we go. Loosen up, camera two. Cameras one and three, that's fine. - [Assistant] In five, four, three, two, one. - [Director] Cue lights, music.

A country steeped in tradition thousands of years old. An ancient culture weathering the stormy onslaught of Western influences. (quirky accordion music) Al had traveled to this distant land as an ambassador of international peace and understanding, and to promote his two new Japanese albums. The success of Al's music in Japan was an unprecedented phenomenon. Al's meteoric rise up the Japanese charts and the enormous response to his videos endeared him to the hearts of millions. Al found himself a celebrity stranger in a strange land. A longtime student of human behavior, Al was anxious to observe traditional Japanese customs. ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ A wop bop a loo bop a lop bom bom ♪ ♪ I got a gal named Sue ♪ ♪ She knows just what to do, whoo ♪ ♪ I got a gal named Sue ♪ ♪ She knows just what to do ♪ ♪ She knows how to love me, yes, indeed ♪ ♪ Boy, you don't know what you do to me ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, whoo ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ A wop bop a loo bop a lop bom bom ♪ ♪ I got a girl named Daisy ♪ ♪ She almost drives me crazy ♪ ♪ Got a gal named Daisy ♪ ♪ She almost drives me crazy ♪ ♪ She knows how to love me, yes, indeed ♪ ♪ Boy, you don't know what you do to me ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ (upbeat music) - [Narrator] On the way to do a number of radio and television appearances, Al and his guide looked for a bite to eat. - I'm starved. Any place to eat around here? - Yes, a lot of Japanese restaurants. Oh, look, how about this? - Ew. Ew. Ew! What? - What? - [Al] Over there! - I'll explain the ingredients. It's all-beef pat- - I know what this is. ♪ Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it ♪ ♪ Get yourself an egg and beat it ♪ ♪ Have some more chicken, have some more pie ♪ ♪ It doesn't matter ♪ (interviewer speaking Japanese) (interpreter speaking Japanese) - I can't understand a word you're saying.

Unfortunately, he wandered into a pachinko parlor, the Japanese national pastime. People spend endless hours watching thousands of little, steel balls bouncing around at random. Al thought this was a great idea and was totally mesmerized until a flashing red light indicated a psychomotor overload and Al feared his head would explode. Overwhelmed and exhausted by the events of the day, Al checked into a hotel in downtown Tokyo, where rooms are available for the bargain price of $15 a night. (Al speaking Spanish) (receptionists speaking Japanese) - Capsule? Night-night? Capsule night-night? (receptionists speaking Japanese) - Name, address. - [Narrator] This modern hotel boasted a variety of luxury suites, each complete with all the comforts of home. An AM FM stereo radio, (man speaking Japanese) A color TV, an adjustable reading light, and the added convenience of personalized room service. - Um... Gracias. - [Narrator] Reflecting on all he had seen and done, Al's imagination ran wild with thoughts of further adventures in strange and faraway places as he turned in for the night. (dramatic music) - Tonight is your last chance to catch this week's top 20 videos on the "MTV Top 20 Video Countdown." - [Narrator] After returning home from his trip to the Orient, Al decided to activate his pirate satellite transmitter and take over the airwaves of MTV. (static crackling) (distorted voices echoing) (man imitating whooshing air) - [Man] Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. (quirky music) - "Al TV," another one of those music video kind of shows you watch on television sometimes. All right, it's time once again for "Al News." Starting off on a sad note, Mick Jagger is in traction this week after being involved in a minor car accident. It seems he stuck his head out of the window on the freeway only to be slapped repeatedly in the face by his own lips. Doctors have called it the worst case of liplash they've ever seen. Well, get well soon, Mick. On the concert scene, Elvis Costello is in the process of planning his next North American tour, and there's talk he'll be out on the road with the international supergroup ABBA. So, look for ABBA and Costello when they come to your town. There seems to be a little problem with the billing, however. They still haven't decided who's on first. Got a letter from Kathy Splain out of El Paso, Texas, and... Aw, it's an envelope full of chili. That's great, thanks, Kathy. ZZ Top's management tells us the group decided to shave off their beards last week, and we here at "Al TV" wish ZZ Top the best of luck with their new image. Okay, what could this be? Oh, no. Oh, no. I hate these chain letters. And in our "Hollywood Report," Sting has been turning down movie offers for some time now, just waiting for the ideal role to come along. Well, apparently it has, because word has it that Sting just signed a contract to play the title role in a remake of the Jerry Lewis movie "The Nutty Professor." When asked for a comment, all Sting could say was, "La, la, la, nice lady." While you're waiting, you might as well hop out to the kitchen for a little nutrition break. This is one of my favorite recipes: ice cream, carrots, Twinkies, and mustard on whole wheat bread. Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. We'll be right back.

Well, I'm eating my lunch right now, so let's just keep the show going. You're watching "Al TV," the music video program that helps build strong bodies 12 ways. Anyway, I want you to meet a special friend of mine. This is my best friend in the whole world, Harvey the wonder hamster. Say hello, Harvey. Oh, isn't he cute? Isn't he cute? Go ahead, make my day. Just kidding. This is great, I can't wait to see this. Right now we're going to world-premiere of the new "State of Shock" video on "Al TV." They told me I should read this letter before I play it. "Dear Al, hope you enjoy the new 'State of Shock' video. We here at Epic Records consider it a great privilege that you are world-premiering it on 'Al TV.' We did have a problem, however. We couldn't get Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson to appear in the video. But we wanted a video real bad, so we just did the best we could. Yours truly, Harvey Leeds, Epic Records." Well, thanks, Harvey. Okay, without further ado, here's the world premiere of "State of Shock" on "Al TV." - 300,000 albums when the movie was on cable television for one month. You know, what are you hockin' me for? Play the video. You don't want to play it? Go play Bugs Bunny videos. Call Burbank, okay? Now, if you wanna do this promotion, we can talk about that some other time. Look, I gotta go, all right?

People are asking, "Al, is there any truth to the rumor that the great songs of rock and roll were actually written by ancient astronauts?" Well, I can't say for sure. All I can do is let you take a look at the evidence and decide for yourself. Here's an aerial photograph of the Himalayan mountain range taken by a research team during the 1950s. The phrase be bop a lula is clearly burned on the mountaintop in letters 2,000 feet high. Who but ancient astronauts would have the time to do something stupid like this? Here, take a look at the Fleetwood Mac "Rumors" album. Look at the position of Mick and Stevie's bodies on the cover. As you can see from this diagram, their bodies are aligned in such a way that it looks like some kind of constellation that ancient astronauts might hang out in or something. Okay, not too good, wait. Okay, look at this. On The Beatles' "White Album," if you look at the back cover, near the bottom, almost invisible to the naked eye, there it is. "Thanks Bob." That's right, Bob, a famous ancient astronaut. But wait, there's more. Remember that old Pink Floyd album "Ummagumma"? Well, I did a little research, and I found out that ummagumma is a common alien phrase which, translated literally, means "We're running out of good ideas for songs. Help us." Hmm. Need more proof? Here's a copy of "Houses of the Holy" by Led Zeppelin. Let's take a look at the actual record. Look at that. It's perfectly round. And that's not all. Listen to this. (record warbling) Kinda sounds like a spaceship taking off, doesn't it? And look at this. If you put a scoop of cottage cheese right on the top, it even looks like something from outer space. Whoa, this is scary stuff, oh! What? Still not convinced? Okay, here's the clincher. Listen to this. "Don't Fear the Reaper" by Blue Oyster Cult, listen. ♪ Seasons don't fear the reaper ♪ ♪ Nor do the wind, the sun, and the rain ♪ - Okay, okay, now let's listen to that backwards. (discordant music) - [Blue Oyster Cult] Hello. we would like to take this opportunity to thank the ancient astronauts for helping us write this- - Incredible, isn't it? - Thank you, thank you. - Well, I could go on, but we're running out of time. You're watching "Al TV," the video music channel that gives meaning to your boring, miserable life. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. - No, thank you, thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - [Singer] Oh, we really appreciate it. (quirky music) - [Narrator] As Al's success continued to flourish, stardom began to take its toll, and he turned inward to search for the meaning of life. This introspective period of Al's life spawned the highly personal and emotionally charged album entitled "Me, Myself, and I." This album included the songs "Apples, Oranges, and Silence," "Cosmic Shoes," and "Everybody Shut Up." During this period, Al experimented with a variety of recording techniques to intensify his personal expression. (intense discordant music) It was in these sessions that Al searched for new sources of inspiration to complement his creativity. In further search of universal understanding, Weird Al stumbled upon Baba Fred Denandananda, a suburban guru who extolled the virtues of existentialism and low-interest second-mortgage payments. Realizing that they were about to lose him to an endless sea of unproductivity, the members of Al's band took matters into their own hands. With the help of his close friends, Al snapped out of his troubled state. Unfortunately for history, the master tapes from this introspective period were accidentally erased when Al carried them through the metal detector at the Los Angeles International Airport. We can only guess what impact this album would have had upon the world. - Yeah, we were all pretty worried about Al for a while. For a period of time, he just didn't seem like himself. But like any great artist who knows his true calling, he just seemed to snap out of it and return to his true self. In fact, all of us around him felt that by him going through this introspective experience, that he matured more as a person and as an artist. I noticed the change in the studio right away. He was more self-confident and more self-assured. His artistic goals seemed to be clearer than ever. I think he really showed the world that he was capable of growth and change, that he could handle the responsibility of stardom. Yep, we're pretty proud of him. - We always knew that Alfred would make something of himself. - Yeah, he was always a straight A student. Kind of kept to himself, though. - We were so proud when he announced that he was going to be an architect. - Yeah, architects make pretty good money. Doctors make better money. - But he wanted to be an architect. - Always told him, "Whatever you want to do, it's okay with us." - "Just as long as your happy." - But then he started doing all that rock and roll stuff. - We didn't understand. - What did we send him to college for? Not so he could hang around with a bunch of jerks. - He used to be such a nice boy. Where did we go wrong? - [PA Announcer] Dr. Roth, please report to Emergency. Dr. Roth.

There's all kinds of money that can be made here. It's like apples and oranges, death and taxes, Amos and Andy, ba-da-beep, ba-da-bop, ba-da-boom. - Mr. Cohen. Mr. Yankovic. I don't want to take much of your time, so let me get straight to the point. This little baby's gonna sell like hotcakes. It's a perfect tie-in for your client. It's the hottest product on the rock and roll market today. - This item's a perennial that never fails to grab the younger market. Now, if you're talking penetrating the six to 12-year-old segment, this baby wholesales for $14.95. But believe me when I tell you the stores won't be able to stock 'em fast enough. - Sounds interesting. - It comes complete with a genuine nylon wig, plastic, nontoxic eyeglasses, and a self-adhesive, fire-resistant mustache. It is a genuine fun item. Why, my whole family derives hours of pleasure from this unique leisure product. - You know, Al, all your female fans everywhere will love this. Now, maybe they're at home, they're having a great, romantic evening with a husband, a boyfriend, they're playing Weird Al music on the record player, and they need that certain something to turn up the heat. Voila. Edible underwear. Great idea, huh? - That's fantastic. What do you think, Al? - [Narrator] Al realized that his vision of show business was very different from the glaring reality confronting him. This palatial estate, now known as Yankland, became Al's retreat. Previously owned by Charlie Chaplin and Ricardo Montalban, Al used his unique design talents to adapt the house to his personal living standards. Although he owned thousands of automobiles, this '77 Toyota was his favorite. One of the pleasures that comes with international stardom is the companionship of Hollywood's most alluring starlets. - Yeah, Al's career is really exploding. The things he comes up with. It boggles my mind. How does he do it? In fact, we've just come from editing his latest video. It's phenomenal. It's hip, it's black, it's country, it's now. It's all over the charts. Here, let me show it to you. You're gonna love this. Hey, are we still rolling? Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute. Cut that, shut that thing off. (screen beeping) (clapboard clacking) In fact, we've just come from editing Al's latest video.

It was truly inspired. The light behind Al was mystical. - I feel good about it myself. I knew that take 32 was going to be the one. - Yeah, but did we have to do it so many times? I mean, take 32 looked the same as take three. - Didn't have the magic. - Yeah, well, guess this is almost a wrap, so we can get this thing in the can, huh? By the way, has Al come up with an end for the video yet? - I don't think so, but he's working on it. - Oh, wait, working on it? What, what, what, like his last album? God, it took him six months just to come up with a title. I mean, I don't even think his stuff is funny. Oh, oh, sure, my kids like it and everything, but- (objects clattering) Al, how you doing? Love your stuff, babe. I wanna tell you, this video is gonna be a monster, and all the guys down at the label are behind you 110%. - Shh. - I got it! A kiwi. - Oh, a kiwi. - Kiwi, $1.15 a pound. - Are kiwis imported? - Yeah. - A kiwi. - No! An eggplant. - An eggplant. - No, no, never mind. A kiwi, more seeds. - Uh, okay, we should now be able to- - A man! I see a man wrapped in bandages from the waste up, no! From head to toe. His entire body covered with bandages, a bandaged man. And he's got a knife in his left hand. And what is he cutting? A kiwi! - (gasps) This is fantastic. - Did I say they were Day-Glo green bandages? - No. - Come on, let's shoot this thing. We have the smoke happening, so come on! Everybody's waitin'. - Yeah, yeah, I agree, time is money. Let's get this thing in the can, huh? - Okay, let's see. We've got a man dressed in bandages from head to toe. Green bandages. He's holding a knife in his left hand, and he's cutting open a kiwi. - And he's wearing sunglasses. - (gasps) This is fantastic. - I don't know, I don't get it. I mean, what's this got to do with anything? I mean... - It's a dream. It's all happening in a dream. - It's beautiful. It's like a cross between "The Wizard of Oz" and "Return of the Mummy." - Sounds good to me. - Mr. Potato Head! (Frank gasps) A whole army of Mr. Potato Heads. - High concept. I love it. It works. - I need a fisheye lens and a crane. - Okay, so, now that that's settled, let's put this thing to bed. This video does world-premiere tomorrow, and maybe we can still bring it in under budget. - Shh, he's on a roll. - Chinese checkers, mashed potatoes, and a Tyrannosaurus rex. - Fabulous, fabulous. It's like a cross between "Blade Runner" and "Kramer vs. Kramer." - Unbelievable, unbelievable. - Oh, yeah, and I suppose they all ride off into the sunset on plastic cows, huh? - That's good, I like that. Plastic cows. (fog machine whirring) - We gotta shoot this. Al, can I get you anything? - [Jerry] What? What'd he say? - [Frank] This is fabulous, fabulous. More smoke.

And now, I'd just like to take this opportunity to say thank you to all of my fans who have been so supportive over the years. I can't begin to tell you how much you all mean to me. You know, without you, I'd be nothing. Well, not exactly nothing, but I'd be a worthless hunk of slime. I'd be a horrible, smelly, weasel-faced shell of a man just crawling around in the gutter and eating leftover macaroni and cheese out of the garbage can. I'd be this fat, hairy, disgusting slob with green teeth, talking to fire hydrants and drooling on myself. I'd be less than human. I'd be a pathetic little worm. No, not a worm, a kangaroo. I'd just be this kangaroo hop, hop, hopping along. Did I say kangaroo? I meant an amoeba. I'd be a one-celled amoeba, or a paramecium. Yeah, yeah, that's it, a paramecium! I can see it now! I'd be this lousy, stinking paramecium, just waving my flagella all around and translocating from place to place. I'd be this, hey, hey, where you going? Hey, wait a minute, come back! Hey! Hey! - [Narrator] Weird Al, the man, the myth, the legend. Where will he go from here? What new worlds will he conquer? Who does he think he is? Will he continue to capture the hearts of millions, or will he fade into oblivion like some insignificant pest? How should I know? (dramatic music) (upbeat music)
