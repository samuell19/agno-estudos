Frankie was probably the most naturally talented performer I'd ever seen. He was... Energetic, dynamic, charismatic. He got on that stage, and, baby, he was huge, bigger than life. See, you all got to understand. By the time I met Frankie, he was a record-deal-needing, broke-ass, scam-on-his-mama-for-a-fix druggie. Hell, the boy had so many needle marks on him, I thought he was a goddamn pincushion. Hmph. A cute pincushion, who could sing his little ass off. Frankie was a perfect gentleman. We had a wonderful courtship. He used to bring me flowers and write me poetry and... Nobody could do it like Frankie Lymon. He was a junkie motherfucker. He was the love of my life. I don't know what I can say about this next act. What can you say but "sensational" all over the world.

If Frankie wrote the song, then he must own at least part of the publishing and its copyright, thereby making it part of his estate, so, uh, yeah, you'd be due those earnings. Oh, yes! All right!

Well, she was obviously divorced by the time... No, I don't think so. This is a copy of the divorce decree. Your client and Charles Phillips weren't divorced until 1965. Meanwhile, I married Frankie October 8, 1965, in Mexicali, Mexico. Plus we have a contract with Mr. Levy stating that Zola gets 15 grand, plus 20% of future royalties as long as she proves she's Frankie Lymon's widow. Wait. This is the same deal you cut with Elizabeth. And tried to cut with me. I tried to stop them, sir. It's all right. Emira, this Elizabeth Waters, Peter Markowitz, Lawrence Roberts and Zola Taylor.

Shouldn't have gave it to them. Shh. Shouldn't have gave it to them. It's ok. Because I gave Coop that money, we couldn't pay our rent and we got evicted, so we had to move in with my mama in Philly. ♪ Oh, she may be weary ♪ ♪ Young girls, they do get wearied... ♪ We lived in Philadelphia for two years. Boy, they were hard times. Frankie was hardly ever working, and we never had no money. He was struggling with his drug thing. He really tried to quit. And I still believed in him. One time we drove down to Virginia for a gig. What are we doing here? Come on. Say, we want to get married. Married? We do? Did you change your mind? No! No! Of course I want to marry you. Baby, I told you. I'm gonna give you everything. I promise. Let's get to it. Ok. I'm a little nervous. S-sign here. Right here? Ok. Elizabeth, I'd like you to take a look at this document. Do you recognize the signatures? Yes. They're Frankie's and mine. And can you tell me what it says next to the words "status of applicant"? "Single." I'm sorry. I couldn't hear that. It says, "single." Could you explain to the court why you wrote the word "single"? Actually, Frankie filled in that part. I guess he didn't want any confusion to stop us. So you admit there was confusion because you were still married to your first husband. You lied on your application. Not intentionally. I didn't know I was still married. This lawyer told me I was free to marry again. Isn't it true you'd have done anything to marry Frankie Lymon, including lie? Objection! Don't answer that! I loved Frankie!

Thank you. Elizabeth... Did you ever see Frankie again after the unfortunate incident with the dog? Yeah. Later, in 1965 in LA. Did Frankie mention he married Zola Taylor? He ain't married no Zola. He was still married to me. In fact, he wrote me in Philly telling me things weren't working out with her. He didn't tell you shit. And begged me to come and see him. And I went to see him. But I didn't know we were staying at Zola's house. I'm glad you came out to see me. I was... I was missing you, baby. I want you to know, I'm really sorry about the way things turned out. They say the best way to put the past behind you is start all over. Start over? What the fuck is going on? Zola! Put your clothes on. Hey, Z. This is my friend... I don't give a shit who the fuck she is. What the hell is she doing in my pool? He invited me for the night. I'm leaving tomorrow. For the night? You're getting your shit and getting the fuck out now! She's leaving. Wait! Are those my clothes?! Are you putting on my shit? Are you crazy? Out there with my man in my pool in my shit? I'm going to kill her! Wait! Hold on! Frankie, you up here with that bitch that brought you down in New York? Who you calling bitch? I'm gonna put my foot so far up your ass that you will be sprouting shoelaces! Damn! Frankie! Oh! Oh! Oh! No, wait! Get her out! Get me? Goddamn it! That is a lie, your honor! You know it didn't go down like that! Miss Taylor. Lie after lie after lie. Do something. Will you chill? You're supposed to be a class act. I am a class act. Then act like one. It's after 4:00. I suggest we end today's session and resume tomorrow at 9:00. We are adjourned. Your honor, I'd like to call Zola Taylor to the stand. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you're about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god? Yes, the real truth. Miss Taylor, can you tell me how long you and Frankie Lymon were involved? On and off for 10 years. What happened in 1962? I had to tour Europe with The Platters, and Frankie's play dates started to dwindle. And I believe that was the time when... He started using. Heroin? Yes. When Frankie couldn't get that high from being on stage... I think he... Tried to find it elsewhere. You see, Frankie's career was never the same after he split from The Teenagers. I was on tour, traveling with The Platters, and I saw Frankie less and less. I still had my place in New York, though. Frankie still had the key. Zola! Ha ha! Hey, Z! Zola Taylor, you tried to sneak in town and didn't tell nobody. Come here. Mmm! It was obvious that he had been doing some drugs. Strung out. My mink stole, Frankie. Where is it? You askin' the wrong person. I don't... mink? I do... Frankie. I thought you took it. Look, Frankie, I only came back here to do this Ed Sullivan show. And then I'm packing up all my stuff, as you can see, and I'm going back to LA. For good this time. For good? While I was on tour this last time, Frankie, I, uh... I got married. I... I know it's all kinda sudden for you, but you know, he lives out in LA. He used to be a drummer, but now he's a carpenter. Out of the blue? Just like that? He's a really nice man. He's stable. Do you love him? I told you, Frankie, he's a nice, good man. I didn't ask that! I asked you, do you love him? Yes! I love him, ok? No, no. That's bullshit. You said marriage would tie you down. You just didn't want to be tied down to me. I never said that, Frankie. Oh, yeah. That's what you said. Let me tell you something. You gonna always be tied down to me, whether you like it or not. We're like magnets. Mm-mmm. Frankie, please. Don't do this to me, Frankie. Don't leave me right now, Zola. I'm married. That was a mistake. That was a mistake! No! I got a life, Frankie, and it ain't gonna include you. Now you got to go. Get out! ♪ ...that you sang ♪ ♪ So sweetly ♪ ♪ You called it ♪ ♪ Our love refrain ♪ ♪ Out in the cold again... ♪ I didn't see Frankie for another three years. And then one day, out of the blue, he called me up. And he said that his career had completely nose-dived. He wanted to know if he could come out to LA and if I could help him get some gigs. I said, "Sure. Come on out." 'Cause, see, I knew Frankie. And I knew that he needed to sing like he needed the air to breathe. Frankie! Frankie! Zola! Zola! Oh, wow! Damn, Frankie, you look... Well, come over here. All right. Yeah, I got all dressed up to come on out here. Well, first you need to come up out that conk. Yes. You in LA, baby. Out here, we ain't colored no more. We're black.

I'm already digging it. Hey! Peace! All right! Everybody's into a different bag out here, Frankie. It was a beautiful day. I took him to my house. Frankie couldn't believe my house. I don't believe it. This is... this is beautiful. Ha ha! Whoo! Man! Y'all got a pool. Wow. Man, y'all got every... Look at this. Look at this! I'm on the top of the world, ma! Actually, I don't think it was the day. No, no, no. I'm mistaken. It was nighttime, actually. Yeah, because I remember... The lights were twinkling. I'm on top of the world, ma! I remember. It was really romantic. This is great! Wow. Man. You got everything. Oh. Y'all got an extra bathtub outside? It's a jacuzzi, Frankie. Oh, a jacuzzi. I'm gonna try that out. Now, look, you know I'm on leave from The Platters, right? What? Mm-hmm. Got walking pneumonia in may. They changed me like a light bulb. 11 years... boom. I'm out. Wow. That's... That's heavy, man. So what you doing now? Oh, I got my own little act. Zola Taylor's all-male revue. Oh. I'm doing ok. I can see. Now, look, Frankie, this is the guest room, ok? You can sleep here as long as you want until you get yourself situated. That's beautiful. I appreciate that. Wait, I gotta ask you, how does your husband feel about me be... Frankie, look, when you called, I said I might be able to get you a few gigs. That's it, ok? Don't expect nothing else. Ok, I'm not, I'm not. Ok, it's cool. I can dig it. So tell me, when do I meet the carpenter? What? I divorced him in Mexico, Frankie. You divorced him? In Mexico? Where's the divorce decree? Uh, your honor, there are extenuating circumstances regarding the divorce papers. But miss Taylor will testify that... Miss Taylor? Actually, your honor, all my papers got destroyed. Well, did you try to get a copy? Most certainly. I contacted The Platters' lawyer, Ruben Rodriguez, to see if he could put me in touch with Mr. Worrell... He was the attorney that arranged the whole Mexican divorce in the first place. But, uh, I found out that he was dead. Is Mr. Rodriguez alive? Yes, but he's in the hospital. He's in the hospital. Yes, with his feet cut off. Let me just get a handle on this. You got divorced in Mexico, but nobody can find any records. Your Mexican divorce papers were somehow destroyed. Your ex-husband is dead, your Mexican attorney's dead, and your lawyer... Your lawyer just had his feet amputated, so he can't come here to testify for you? Basically, yes. Ok. Ok, Mr. Roberts, continue... Somehow. Thank you, your honor. Uh... Miss Taylor... Did you marry Frankie Lymon? Yes, I did.

What? ...and told me that she was married to Frankie just to hurt my feelings. And I believed him because he was my husband. And if he wasn't my husband, why in the hell would I have trusted him with my most prized possession? My house. Come on, now, Z. Four months on the road over in Asia? It's gonna feel like forever. Frankie, you're gonna be just fine. Can't they give you a break or something, so you can come home and... Baby. Baby, listen... Take this, ok? There's enough money here to pay for the mortgage, the bills, everything. Zola, you know I don't like taking money from you. Baby, it's our money. How am I supposed to remember all this? I wrote it down, ok? You'll find it. Are you sure you'll come back? I'll be back. You'll find time for a break, right? It's gonna go by in no time. Frankie and I weren't in touch until about five months later. One day I called and my phone was disconnected, so I asked my sister if she would go over and see what was going on. And when she picked me up from lax, she told me that Frankie had had some woman at my house and that a neighbor had to call the police because of all the arguing and fighting going on. And I knew exactly who that woman was, too. And then my sister told me that I couldn't go home, 'cause I didn't have one. Frankie. Oh, Frankie. Frankie! Frankie, you fucking son of a bitch! Frankie! Everything I'd worked for... Gone. Everything. When I went to the bank, there was no money, either. I tried to call Frankie in New York, but his numbers were all disconnected. Then I heard he had been drafted into the army. I had nowhere to go, so I had to move in with my sister. It was a real nice house. And I'm real sorry about it. I am. But I swear to you, Zola, I never went back up there. It's been 18 years. You'd think I'd be through with all that by now. State your name and address for the records. Emira Eagle Lymon. 2110 Clairview Drive, Augusta, Georgia. Mrs. Lymon, could you state your educational background for the record, please? After high school, I attended Morris Brown College for about a year. Then Albany State College, Augusta College, Plaine College. And I've done studies at Savannah State College, as well as the University of Georgia. Do you hold any degrees? Is the pope an old white man? I have a bachelor's degree in social studies as well as a bachelor's degree in education. Now, with all your accreditations and degrees, how did you come to meet Frankie Lymon? He marched right into my bathroom. I was getting out of the tub, and he said... Looking good, doll. And I said... Aah! Get out! Go! Get out! Hold up, Emira. You know who this is? I don't care who he is! It's Frankie Lymon, the singer. Tell him to sing his behind on out! Wait, wait, wait. No disrespect, ma'am. Eddie said I could grab a beer from the fridge. I was only looking for the kitchen. Are there usually toilets in the kitchen? There was a cockiness about him, you know? A bravado. And he was so cute... In a real street sort of way. Let me help you there. Shit. Ohh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Just wanted to help out. They're oatmeal. I made them myself. Em's a great cook. She oughta be owning a restaurant instead of teaching crumb-crushers. Mmm. I love oatmeal cookies. They're my favorite. Uh, look, I really wanna apologize for barging in on you. I didn't mean to walk in and to see what I... Wait, let me introduce y'all formally. Uh, Frankie, this is Emira Eagle, my fiancée's sister. Emira, this is Frankie Lymon. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too, Frankie. After that, Frankie kept showing up... Emira. Frankie. ...and showing off. They're beautiful. Thank you. Well, I was hoping I could walk you home again. Oh. All right. He was just incredibly sweet, a perfect gentleman. Never made a pass or came on strong again. And he didn't curse around me. Hey, Frankie. Hey, Emira. I brought you a present. Where'd you find the puppy? At the pound. Can't resist him, huh? Oh, it is hard. He's so cute. Mmm. What's smelling so good? Chicken and gravy. Pecan pie. You hungry? You know, Eddie was right. You sure can cook. Thanks. The Greens are from my garden. We would've had carrots, but the rabbits had a feast this week. Yeah? Well, um, I could make a net box for you, if you like. Really? For a city boy, he was pretty handy with a hammer... Just right at home gardening and working in the earth. Gardening! A hammer? Frankie wouldn't know a hammer if it hit him in the head. Please, Peter, object to something, 'cause gardening? She got to be lying. Then one day he just floored me. Oh, man. That was such a good movie. Yeah. This way. Wow. Um, Emira... I wrote something for you. Really? Yeah. I hope you like it. Uh, don't laugh. All right. Here goes. "The wonder of you fills me up, "takes me to your depths, "and I bare my soul to you, "o cherished queen of Sheba. "When you smile, you give light." "When you speak..." "You give life." "And when you leave, you take my love." I fell in love at that moment. I-it's not finished. I still have some more work... Oh, I love it. I love it. It's great. Next day, we got engaged, and about a month later, we got married. Thank you. Thank you. Don't look. Oh. Oh, right, right. I won't look. I mean, until you tell me... When I should look. Ready?

Put the, uh... this one up, too. Yeah! Postman! Got a package for Frankie Lymon. Oh, all right. Sign right there, bro. You Frankie Lymon? Yeah. The singer? Yeah. For real? Yeah. Oh, man, wait till I tell my wife. I thought you was dead. Man, we used to dance to your stuff all the time. Man, you great. You're fantastic. Have a happy holiday. God bless you. Frankie Lymon. I delivered a package to Frankie Lymon. Ha ha! Wow. Merry Christmas. I know you don't understand this music business, but you're in school, and you're a teacher. You know... No, Frankie. I understand. Ok. Ok. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Your book. Yeah. Your poetry book. Here. Oh, great. I'm so happy you understand that this is what I gotta do, you know? It's my life. Frankie! Your lunch. Oh! My lunch. Yeah. All right. And, uh, I want you to make me a pecan pie, so when I get back I can have something nice for dessert. Ok. All right. I been thinking... Let's start a family, you know? I mean, we got such a good life here. We should share it with somebody. I love you. I love you. Mmm. I love you, too. Gotta go. But you think about a family, all right? Ok. I'll miss you! I'll miss you, too. I'll be back soon. Ok. Call me when you get there, ok? All right. All right. That was the last time I saw him... Alive. About a week later, Frankie's brother called me to tell me that Frankie had overdosed. No further questions, your honor. Do you think we could take an hour's recess, please, ma'am? All right, Mr. Grahme. Emira... Look, just let me talk to you for a second. Emira! Emira... Emira, wait! Wasn't it enough I couldn't have him in life? Can't I at least have him in death? No! None of us can. That flat-footed little weirdo played all of us. He sure did. Why don't we go have a drink? That's a good idea. Come on. But I don't drink. Well, honey, you about to start. You can have an iced tea or something. You don't have to drink. That lying, no-good, no-bill-paying, house-losing bigamist! Please. A trigamist. Who gardens, no less. Honey, come on. Frankie and flowers? Gimme a break. I don't even know what I saw in that little... It wasn't like he was some bronze Adonis or some shit. I thought he was talented. Ok, he could sing. He could sing me right out of my panties. I got to give it up for that. The boy was a good fuck. Ohh, come on, Emira. Now, you know you got that rock of Gibraltar. Come on now! You guys are talking about my husband. Your husband? Your husband? Please. He was all of our husbands. But I just don't understand. How could he write me those beautiful love poems, knowing he was still married to at least one of you? Come on now. That was Frankie being Frankie. Amen. Frankie just... Needed something different all the time. Something different. My god, look at us. Could we be more different? I mean, look at you. You're a glamorous singer. I'm just a Southern schoolteacher. And, you, Elizabeth, look at you. I mean, you... I'm not sure what to think of you. I mean, no disrespect. It's just that... What did Frankie see in you? Ooh. Girl, now, what you talking about? Shoot, back in the day, I was a sho'nuff fine foxy thing. Tell her, Zola. You was there. Tell her. I was there and... She was all right. No, you didn't. But foxy? You were more poodley. Forget y'all. Whatever. Hey. Maybe there were three separate Frankies, and each of us got a piece. I think Frankie was like that broken record. Maybe that's what happened that last day. It got so painful... He couldn't put himself back together. I just wish we would've been there to save Frankie from himself that day. Girl, you don't know how many times I tried to save Frankie over the years. Shoot, he wore me out. It just couldn't be done. I wonder who this next surprise witness is. Better not be another woman. Hey, how you doing? All right. Frankie Lymon here to see Morris Levy. Do you have an appointment? Uh, no. Uh, not... not actually. Uh, I'm an old friend. He knows me, you know? Uh-huh. Mr. Levy? A Mr. Frankie Lemon is here to see you. No, no, no. Frankie Lymon. Get rid of him. Hey, Morris! Long time no see. Excuse me! You ain't got a minute to talk to an old buddy who's made you a couple million bucks? Hey, Frankie, your last album was eight years ago, so don't pull the "old friend" bullshit on me. Now, what can I do for you? Look, I'm glad you asked. All right, I'm gonna be straight with you, Morris. I'm ready to get back out there. Now, I went down south for a while, and I got married, but I've still been writing and still singing, man, and people still seem to know who I am. Jeez, where are the violins? No, you don't understand. I still can do the sp... Well, I can't do the splits right now, but I'm telling you, I still got it. Still got it? Yeah. Who the fuck cares, you still got it? In case you don't know it, doo-wop is dead. The Beatles stomped it out, Motown kicked it out, and Hendrix took it someplace else. Now get out of my office. No, no, wait, man. Listen. Let me just do a demo or something. Why don't you call one of your cronies up and... And what? Tell them I got a blackballed junkie in my office looking for a comeback? Hold on now, Morris. You're taking it too far now, ok? I'm not a junkie any... I don't shoot up, man. I'm clean. Please! You shoot up, and you're a no-show at gigs. Hey, only an asshole takes a chance on a junkie. I told you I'm not a fucking junkie! Didn't you just hear me?! Do you know who the fuck you're talking to, huh? You see what I mean?! This is why you're not booked at the Orpheum tonight! You understand that? You're a crazed maniac. Look, Morris... You're not a cute kid anymore, Frankie. You're a loser, you're a has-been, and you're a fuckin' drug addict!

So sad. He was so talented. Mr. Levy, do you know what this is? Yeah. Sure. It's why do fools fall in love. Oh, uh, Mr. Levy, whose names appear as songwriters on this? Lymon and Levy. Uh-huh. Well, how did this come about, you writing the song with Frankie? I don't understand. Did you two sit down together at the piano, uh, he plays some music... No, no, no. You get together, and you kind of put the words and the music together. You get a beat going. I mean, I'm not saying that I'm writing songs like Chopin. Like Chopin. That's very funny. Very funny, Mr. Levy. It's not quite as funny as this, though. Now, whose names are listed as songwriters on this record? It's "Lymon, Santiago, and Goldner." Uh-huh. As in Herman Santiago, the original lead singer of The Teenagers? What's the name of this song? Why do fools fall in love. Why do fools fall in love. So, in fact, Mr. Levy, you didn't write the song. You just slapped your name on it so you could collect songwriter royalties and copyright entitlements. Listen, counselor, I'm a businessman. It was just business. Mr. Levy, how much money have you made over the years from the song why do fools fall in love? Who knows? Try $4 million, Mr. Levy. $4 million! Shh. And how much of that money, Mr. Levy, have you tried to pay to Frankie Lymon's estate? I got accountants for that kind of stuff. The answer is zero, Mr. Levy. Nothing. Not one single penny, Mr. Levy! No further questions, your honor. Wait a second. Wait a second. You're all acting like I was the only one doing business that way. Everyone was doing it. Every record producer, every owner of a label, every promoter. It was standard industry practice. All right, Mr. Levy, that's enough. And another thing, there would be no Frankie Lymon if it wasn't for me. I discovered him first. I invested in him first. I promoted him first. And you're sitting here talking like I'm the one who put that smack into his veins. All right, Mr. Levy, I said that is enough. I just wanted you to know... Mr. Levy, you are excused. Thank you very much. You're welcome. All right, we're going to adjourn for today. We'll reconvene tomorrow morning at 9:00 at which time I will render my decision. Thank you. Scotch and soda. Strawberry Margarita. Iced tea, please. Long island iced tea. $4 million. Do y'all believe that shit? Mm-mmm. Shit, when Frankie was alive, he didn't have two nickels to rub together. I heard that. Money like that I only read about in fortune magazine. You read fortune? Yes. It's got forecasts, futures, you know, stock tips. Oh, thank you. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. That is delicious. That long island iced tea flavoring is tasty. Ooh, excuse me. Oh, I'm sorry. Ooh. You know, I wish we could rethink this whole court case and refuse to let our lives be dictated by Morris and Frankie and all these vultures. Honey, I wish we could tell our lawyers to kiss our big butts. Well, here is to telling all of our lawyers to kiss our big butts. Big butts! Juicy booties. Ooh, 'cause I know my butt has gotten a little big. But you know what, ladies? Why don't we tell all of them where to go and walk out of here friends? Baby, I could be a much better friend with 4 million bucks. Wait. If we do your plan, we can all... What plan? What are you talking about? Wasn't it you that said 50% of something is better than no percent of nothing? Then you split your 50% with her. What about you? It's gonna be 30-30-30. Excuse me. Excuse me! What are y'all talking about? 'Cause whatever it is, it sounds illegal to me. No. No. It's not illegal. It is not illegal. It sounds illegal. We can do what we want. It was her idea. It sounds illegal to me. Fuck it, all right? Look, here's the deal: Whoever won, me and her, we was gonna split it 50-50. Now we can cut you in. We don't need to leave here until we can make a deal to get paid. Come on, Emira. That is a million- three-hundred gs each. Each? Each. Each. Well, I could use a new car. You could get yourself a Cadillac, girl. Brougham! Ooh, well, that is Kool and The Gang! Yeah! I knew we could get her. ♪ Met someone who knocked you back off your heels ♪ ♪ Goody goody ♪ ♪ You met someone, and now you know how it feels ♪ What was at issue in this case was determining which of the three alleged widows is the lawful surviving spouse of Frankie Lymon. Widow number one, Elizabeth Waters, claimed that she and Frankie Lymon lived as common-law husband and wife and that they were married in a civil ceremony in the state of Virginia, and all of this, apparently, while she was still married to someone else. Now, widow number two, Zola Taylor, claims that she married Frankie Lymon in either Tijuana or Mexicali, depending upon which day of the week it is. But, unfortunately, miss Taylor was unable to provide any substantive proof of either her marriages or her divorces. Which brings us to widow number three, Emira Eagle, who was married to Frankie in a church ceremony replete with white wedding gown and a honeymoon suite in Augusta, Georgia, and all of this would have been well and good, except for the fact that New York state upholds the Pennsylvania law which recognizes common-law marriage as legal and binding. And since Elizabeth continued to live with Frankie after her divorce from Charles Phillips and based on the statutes... Cross vs. Cross, commonwealth vs. Highland, and Skinner vs. Skinner... Both the common-law marriage and the Virginia marriage were indeed valid, and since neither marriage was dissolved at the time of Frankie's death, it is the determination of this court that the lawful, surviving spouse of frank Joseph Lymon is Elizabeth Waters Lymon. Yeah! Yes! I told you! Yes! Yes! Yes! We did it! Aah! Stop! See, she said that we won, so that mean that y'all lost, so talk to the hand, 'cause me and my counselor got to go. What?! You Jheri curl-wearing, ghetto bitch! I'm gonna whup your ass! Order in the court. Elizabeth won and told the rest of us exactly where to go. She got us. But, you know, hey, I didn't really care, because I was tired of the courts and the lawyers and the whole thing anyway. I wasn't having it. I filed suit in the U.S. court of appeals. It was a mess. It took years. But they ruled in my favor. So, you see, the schoolteacher won Frankie's estate after all. But the final tee-hee-hee was on her. See, Frankie's estate wasn't nowhere near no $4 million. And after all miss thing's lawyers' legal fees and expenses, she only ended up with 15 grand. The same amount that Morris had offered her from jump street. Now, ain't that nothin'? Well, honey, I could've told them wasn't none of them gonna get no money!
