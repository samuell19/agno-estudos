As a kid, you expect to find your one true love. Then you grow up, you fuck around and search. Slowly, you lose hope and think it's all pointless. When did it become so uncool to want someone for the rest of your life? We're not supposed to be this solitary. What if we all could find someone? A single person out of seven billion people in this world- - who truly understands who you are. That one person that enters your universe- - and stays there forever. ETERNAL SUMMER Or maybe it was just me who thought everyone meets someone. Maybe it's supposed to be this way. Fuck it! I don't know. Well, love is like toast. You wonder your entire life if you want it lightly toasted or well-done. Then one day you find it - the perfect heat. The perfect toast with a crisp surface, but still with a soft center. Then it's how you apply the butter - it shouldn't melt too fast or too slow. It's a feeling. And when you have it, you'd better hold on to it. Hold on tightly to that toast or it will... ...all crumble and disappear. - And you have to try a new one. - You can't keep eating toast. - Why? It's delicious. - You'll get iron deficiency. - And vitamin deficiency. - Why does it have to be so complicated? If I like toast, why shouldn't I just say so? It's awesome! Vertical 8, the name of the band. - We have to get this! - Five letters. - Come on, Dad! - Tages! - Tages? - Your mom and I used to listen to this. It's good, listen! This is the precursor of today's pop music. - It all came from this. - T - A - G - E - S. - Awesome, Dad! We'll nail this! - Yes, fuck 'em! The race is on! Let's see... Horse number 7 had a strong start. But number 5 is catching up. Number 7 races on; it looks like a win. It was close, but we have a winner! Congratulations, well done! Any new contestants for the Horse Jam? The battle of the horse... Shit. - Hey! - Hey... - Will I see you tonight? I work late. - Let's check in later. The Pyramid! 15 kronor for two balls. The Pyramid... - Isak! Cheers. - Cheers, cheers. Bottoms up. - Going out tonight? - I'm open to suggestions. - Where? - What, you're coming? Do you think I'm too old? I look like... Be honest now! - Hot as hell! - I'm a fucking male gorilla. - Do you want anything? Shots? - I want one of these. Your dad is so fucking cool! I wish I had a dad like that. Three shots, motherfuckers! Sorry, I had my fingers in there. - But I didn't finger anyone this week. - So damn nasty... He can't handle me being like this, "an old fart can't be horny like that". No, I get horrible pictures in my head. Damn... Cheers to love! Hello. ...yes... Would you like to meet? Isak... Isak. - Good morning, baby! - Good morning. You're wearing my ring? - I'll... I can take it. - Wouldn't it be crazy if we got married? - Yes, that would be crazy. - If you would... ...propose to me, that'd be insane. - So weird. Let's do it, just you and me. Let's get married! - Can I have my... - I'm just kidding. Chill! Or am I? How many kids do you want? - No, I have a few things to... - Hi there! - Hello! - Ugh... Lars. - Erika. - Isak. - Are you roommates? - No, that's my dad. - You have kids? - Well, he's more like a buddy. Are you for real? You're my dad even though they're here. - You're 24, you take care of yourself. - Just how old are you? - You said you were 35. - I did? I'm sorry... - Sometimes I get why Mom left you. - What are you talking about? Who the hell cared for you? You were with me every god damn day. Whether I was working, sleeping, watching TV, showering. Where was she? Why would you mention your bloody mom? And don't say I wasn't responsible! - Sorry. I said I'm sorry. - Aren't I entitled to a life? - I said I'm sorry! - Don't talk crap! - Don't touch me. I'm sorry! - I don't want to hear that stuff. - I'm sorry. - Good. Will you leave? I decide when I leave, and I'm leaving now. - Right... I should probably go too. - I'll join you. See you! Last call! Cheers! Let's drink to her! Cheers, everyone! An Old Fashioned, please. No, wait - surprise me! I'm tired of the same old. What's... What's going on? What's going on? - You little cunt! - Jenny... Damn it! I can explain... What the fuck...! - Who's that? - This... - This is... - Isak. Isak... And who's she? - That's Em. - What kind of a name is that? - Shouldn't you be at a hen party? - I was. - Should we leave? - No, you two stay until we're done! - What happened to your sauna weekend? - Who the hell does that? Sweating with other naked men, is that me? No, but you wouldn't know. - You never listen to me! - No, that's your damn job. Damn... What the hell was that?! - Here... Does that work? - Are you sure? - You're not getting it back. - Oh? - I'm a bit of a kleptomaniac. - Okay! - Think they're doing it? - Either she's pity screwing him. Or a small part of her finds this a bit... Perhaps this was sort of the new start they needed... - So we just solved their issues? - I think so. Okay, so who was that dude? - Won't you tell me? - It's a long story. - I get it. - No, you don't. But that's okay. Okay... What about her? I don't know, it was just for the night. I don't seem to be the type who meets someone for more than one night. - Bullshit... - What? What's your excuse? A shitty childhood? Or... that you get easily bored? - You're throwing accusations at me. - If the shoe fits... And just how easy it is to meet someone? Where are you going? - I don't know. - Then I follow you, Madame... ...to "I don't know". Are you going home, Em? Where's Em? She's with them. What, is Em with them? That femme? Yes, Em - she's with them. It's not even a song! You're just talking. What the hell! - What are you doing tomorrow? - I'm going to Tornio to steal a cello. - Right... - What are you doing? This is insanely strange... ...but I'm also going up north. I'm buying a saxophone in Piteå. - Really? Isn't that the same direction? - Yes, actually it is. - Well, that's perfect. - Yes, we could carpool. - But... why are you stealing a cello? - For my sister. Oh, that's nice. - How long are you staying? - For as long as I want to. A road trip would be nice. We'd eat at crappy truck stops. - And go swimming. - And go swimming. Living on the edge! What...? - Ready? The car's in there. - Huh? What...? - What do you... Now? - Yes. - Now, as in right now? - I'm going. Come if you want. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah, okay. - Great, let's go! Yes, I want to go. Let's go. Fuck it, let's go! Damn, that's nice! Okay. So we're leaving... - Okay, are you ready...? - What's going on? - My, my, my... - You made hot chocolate? How sweet. Cheers! Bottoms up! Just kidding... Listen, what are your plans? What are we... Where are we going? - What do you want to do? - We're going to Tornio. - I told you that before we left. - You were serious about that? Okay. - How do you steal a cello? - I haven't figured that out yet. But we'll manage. - Yes... Are you allowed to steal it? - No, of course not. - But... - But, what? Are you backing out? No, just... It's for your sister, right? She plays, I take it? Exactly. - Is she any good? - Mm. All right, let's do it. Still no answer. - This is Em. I can't answer right now. - Hi, honey. It's Mom. - Dad is very upset you took the car. - They don't make cars like that anymore. - They don't make them anymore. - Doesn't she get what that's worth? It's worth a great deal to him. Please call so we can talk. Bye! - This is unacceptable. - You haven't heard anything, sweetheart? - No, nothing. - Do you know if something's happened? - She seemed... She seemed okay. - It's all futile. She could be anywhere. CABINS & TENTS, RESTAURANT FISHING, CAMPING - People say it's illegal to smoke weed. - You're so boring. Tell me something unexpected about yourself. - I used to compete in swimming. - I used to compete in swimming. - No... Stop. For real? - Yes! - You're kidding! - No. - Were you any good? - Yes. - Why did you quit? - Life happened. - What do you like most about yourself? - My hands, I think. - What's the stupidest thing you've done? - Bring you on a road trip. - What color was my bra when we met? - Black! I think... - How's your relationship with your dad? - Pass. Right? - Look... I hired him. - You did? Perfect timing. Keep going, just move it along! - Wanna go for a swim? - Mm. Would you jump in first to see if it's deep enough? - Okay. If you win, I'll jump in first. - If I win? One, two, three! I want a do-over! I didn't realize what we were doing. - What? - I didn't understand. - Get in. Get in! - What were we doing? Go swimming, right! - One... - It's a done deal. - One... Let's do this. - No, we did! I didn't get it. Go swimming, now? No, it's too late. What the hell...? Feel this! No... No! Em? Em? Em! Em, stop this! - Are you fucking stupid? - I held my breath. Your turn! Come on, Mr. Pro Swimmer! Okay... Will you keep count? Let's do rock-paper-scissors for the bed. One, two, three! Damn it... Go! - I would have given you the bed. - Right... - Are you going to listen to music now? - Mm. Okay. - Good night. - Good night. There isn't a single artist in the world who could do this. - No, it's pretty. - Pretty? Is that all you have to say? It's like "The Lord of the Rings". Okay, let's pick a song that represents this trip. - It'll be our song. - I have the best damn road-trip song. Hey! When you're riding shotgun, you can pick the music. If you have all the rules, perhaps you should drive- - so that I don't drive us into a ditch, like this... Look! You're such a dork. - Who is Erika? - Just a girl from work. - I'll tell her I'm not coming in today. - Give me your phone. - Why? - Just give it to me. - What the hell! What are you doing? - Why do you have to notify the world? What the hell am I supposed to do? I have to call my dad, my work. - Just use a payphone. - What? Did you say payphone? - This is not 1993. - Are you serious? - Are you serious? - Keep looking out here, that's better. You're insane. You're insane! Come on! It's in the throat, and it hurts like hell when I swallow. I guess it's something in the adenoids, from my nose to the tonsils. Great. Thank you so much, I'll be fine soon. Okay, talk to you later. Bye then. Thanks, bye. That's done! You can't be this erratic, it won't work. - Thanks. - Why are you going over there? I'm... just picking up some music stuff that I forgot. - You haven't heard anything? - No. But don't worry, she always does okay. Still, she could have said something before taking off. We've been best friends for 15 years; she never tells me anything. And you don't know anything about the guy? No - but I don't think she does either. It's what she does. If something's hard, she pushes it away... ...by doing some other crazy thing. - Like what? I don't know... She wants to provoke, to do whatever is most forbidden. That's why we love her, isn't it? It's so quiet... It's so quiet! - Should we eat? - Yes, let's go to the restaurant. Do you think we need a reservation? Perhaps not. - Don't... Go throw it away. - I didn't kill it... ...It's like rock hard. - You can get sick from it! - From this? - Yes. We should at least bury it properly. "After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed:" "Father, the hour has come." "Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you." "For you granted him authority over all people... '' - Why are you running? - What if I left you here? "... that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him. '' Damn... Then what? "Now this is eternal life, that they know you. '' May 8th. I feel so purposeless. I wish I felt so strongly about something that would make me do anything- - like my baby sister does. - It's so good. - What is? The cello. I wanna learn how to play so I can have it on my record. - So do it. - It's not something you just do. It's custom made by a woman in Tornio, who makes like five per year. - How pretentious! - I knew you'd laugh. Dad can buy it for me, I'll pay him back later. - Why don't you ask me? - Well... guess. Excuse me! I'm your older sister. "There are only five in the world." Cut it out! - Okay, then I'd like a cello from you. - Okay. She got everything. I got nothing. June 7 th. I'm disappearing. My sister is, like, better friends with my friends than I am. There's nothing worse than feeling lonely among others. - Carl fucking Linné, that's nice! - What the hell does that mean? Linné? He's on the 100 kronor bill - some of us graduated high school. - Carl von Linné - the birds and the bees. - Whatever... - Pure euphoria shouldn't be this easy. - Stop analyzing shit! It's nice! - Sure it's sweet, but isn't it hopeless? - What, doing drugs? - Having to do drugs to feel happy. - What's with the party pooping? - It isn't real. - Hey, I've known the guy for four years. - He didn't sell us any crap. - This is fucking pure! If you're not doing it, I will. Fuck, I feel so left out. Listen, I'm like... Hang on. ...older than you are. - Damn! - Don't you agree? Yes, you're the only one in the world with existential anxiety. Perhaps you should just do one to feel better. If you're not in the mood, you need something. It usually helps you. - You're not listening to me. - Em... It's sweet. - You're such a bunch of cunts. - And you're so boring! We're going out! I'm sick of feeling insufficient, that I don't fit in. I feel like a boring friend and a bad sister, but it's better if she doesn't know. I'm so lost. Why can't I just be like everyone else? Shower, dance, eat, do drugs, fuck. Don't be the way you don't wanna be. Get a grip. Breathe. No one knows, not even my little sister. I thought they'd be bigger. - I really did. - They're not fully grown. Don't you think there's a difference between the animals here... ...and the ones in the wild? - I think they're a bit like me. Expected to behave normally in a world where they don't belong. What am I, the wild beast? Looking for my own food, no one telling me what to do... I see you more like a migratory bird that I shot down and now care for. - A migratory bird? No. - A tiny bird. - They're not that terrifying at all. - But you're not terrifying. In some cases I am. I think so... You're like a thousand piece puzzle, made up entirely of sky and ocean. Hold on... Am I really the complicated one out of us two? - Yes. - You throw phones out of cars... If I'm sky and ocean, then you're a desert puzzle. - Not even a small oasis? - No, no, no. There's a dog buried somewhere, but you can't see him- - because there's sand everywhere. What the hell is that supposed to mean? What's going on? Em? Em? - Will you let me out? - Not without the code. What code? - Open Sesame. - Get real! I don't know the code. Give me a clue at least. The truth... You have to be honest. When I was seven, I... ...used to lock up the smaller kids at daycare until they'd start to cry. Almost all my friends think I'm a black belt in Karate- - but I took like one class, then I got tired of it. At 15, I had to think about death to get the courage to pick up girls. I thought that in 100 years, it's not going to matter if she turns me down. I've never loved anyone. June 24th. I cannot believe I went. I knew it would make me feel worthless. But, I wanted to show her how proud I am of her. Big applause! You must have done something right when your daughter embraces music... ...with the same passion as you. - Of course! I remember that age - bubbling, brimming with creativity. That's what she has, and that's what I want to harness. - Exactly. That's so true! - I'm just so proud of you. - I'm moved by all of this. - The family? The show, your family, the way you care for each other- - the security... It will be incredibly important when we move forward. You must always be able to come home, that's it. Cheers again! - Cheers, Dad! - Cheers, Felicia. And congratulations! - Are you as talented? - In music? I like to say that Felicia got all the good genes, and I the bad ones. It doesn't show, that's for sure. It doesn't show, who I've been and where lm coming from. When I was little, I was so afraid of reality. I thought it would pass. I just wanted to be honest and tell the truth, but lm afraid to. What if that person would go away, too? I can't risk losing everything again. Shit. There's only one thing left to do. What? Okay. One, two, three, four. Come closer. - 22 kronor. - What? The piano was 30 kronor! - Let's think of something else. - I can play a slower tune. - No, something else entirely. - They don't seem to get this music. Come on! - So you're serious? - I'm always serious. - Dare you not? - I don't get the point. The point is, we need the money... ...and it's a cool thing you need to have done. - It's also illegal as hell. - You have the wrong focus. We're here, and we can do whatever the fuck we want. You have to see the freedom in that. It's you and me, isn't it? Fine... Fine, fine, fine! One, two, three! - Everybody freeze, this is a robbery! - It's only me here. Put your motherfucking ass on the floor, now! That's good! Where's the money, is it in here? Yes! Okay, here we go... Very good. - Do you have more money somewhere else? - No. - Are you lying to me? - No! - Hi there! - Hi, hi. - New staff? - What? New staff, I see. Some smokes, menthol. Right, menthol. - That one's good. - It's good? - An even 50. - Right, thanks. Bye! Bye-bye! Okay. Very good! Stay still and you won't get hurt. Bye-bye! This is from the guy in the denim jacket over there. Here you go! Thanks. - Hello! - Hello... I'm just passing through here, and I'd like to spend the night with a stranger. What a coincidence... I'm a resident- - and I'm also looking for someone to spend the night with. - Do you have a light? - Of course. May I ...? July 9th. We fought again today. But this time I can't say sorry. Why am I such a fucking idiot? - Felicia is great. - She's the best. She'll go far. That's the thing with music. It's not about the music- - but about the feelings it creates. Euphoria, nostalgia... You know when you're at a concert, it's freaking amazing, and you cry... - Phat. Do you like house? - No. Yeah, me neither. Look at this old 78 record. - Hold it. - You want me to hold it? Hold it! Okay, do you feel anything? Can't you feel it? - The warmth from the lyrics. - You don't have to sit here. I'm fine. When I look into your eyes, I just feel... ...that there's so much more, wanting to get out. I'd like to know what that is. I think you're pretty. - What are you doing? - Sorry. - What the hell is your problem? - He was being a moron. What do you want? It's not about him. It's about me. Tonight is about me. Is that so hard?! I'm here for you. And you're leaving, making it about you. It's always about you. You don't have anything, so you ruin it for others. You don't care about anyone else. But that's fine. Cause no one cares about you either. I just want to be like everyone else, but it's impossible. I'm nothing. I don't want to be alone. I just am. It's chaos. Like when you don't even feel what you're feeling anymore. Why do I ruin things when all I'm trying to do is not ruin things? I need to quit smoking. Who really smokes anymore? I'm so sick of hearing myself. I need to get out of here. I need to show Felicia that lm something. Whatever that is. Em? Listen, I met some cool people who are having a barbecue. I told them I'm a German tourist. I thought we'd join their barbecue. Don't you want to come? We travel with, obviously, automobile car- - from the north part of Germany, through Travemünde. From there, we go all the way up to Schweden, to the north parts. So what to say, you come from Stuttgart... Stuttgart, yes, from beginning, but also go to Berlin- - which is... Party! Obviously, good, good party in Berlin. Summertime - festival, wintertime - Christmas festival. Very good with Santa Claus... Party! - Here is the partner in crime. - Are you Swedish? - Yes. Oh, you are too? - Yes. - Hi! So you know each other? - Yeah, he... tagged along. - We are going to buy a cello together. - Do you have a light? - Why? - Because it's funny. It's funny. It's good music with cello. Your sausage is very good-looking. It's perfect! They are fighting... Fighting sausages. - You have really nice hands. - You think? - You're... You're nice, too... - You feel a little cold in the fingers. Maybe I can warm you, because the body heat is the best heat. I read in the paper somewhere... I'm sorry. - I can't do this. - Let me get this straight. You jerk me around, I get back at you, and now you're leaving? - No. - No? Maybe lm just not made to be with anyone. Damn... I'm sorry. Em? Em! How did you like my German? What did you think? - I think you're lame... You're lame! - Huh? "Was ist das? Es ist ein problem? Du ist mein Fräulein... '' "You are my girlfriend. You are my girlfriend!" You can't leave me. You can't. I won't leave you. We're doing this together, you and me. You and I are a team. Everyone has their own reality, their own universe. There are seven billion universes. All we want is to find someone- - who truly understands us. That one person who can enter our universe. Here we are again. Do you realize what you are doing? You're dramatizing, exaggerating. - It's like you're in a Shakespeare play. - Shakespeare? - Is that your best reference? - Life is not all cool repartees. You're not listening. - What are you trying to tell me? - We can't keep doing what we're doing. Why can't we keep doing what we're doing? - It's forbidden. - You're absolutely right, Emilia. We can definitely not keep doing what we're doing. Because I'm too young... and you're too married. - And you're my psychologist. - I fucking love it when you say that! I want to be naive, like when I was a child. I thought we all had our own universe. There are seven billion universes. All we want is to find someone who truly understands us. That one person who can enter our universe. And he's not the one. I should talk about my childhood. It's what you do at the shrink's. But I keep running away. - A last night? - A last night. What are you going to say if they answer? There can't be anyone home. One, two, three... Did you look in here? Why is it that you never find money in a drawer? All this junk... Isak... My little peacock. Em... Come here! - No. - What do you mean, no? Open it. No. - Come. - What...? No, not here. What if they come home. - What if? - What if they come home... So... What are you doing here? Okay, I'm sorry. - The house was empty and we were hungry. - But you don't have any right. - I get it. We'll take our stuff and go. - You're not going anywhere. Please, don't call. I'm sorry. Why don't you say something? I don't know what to say. This is not why I came along. - I'm going home. - You're not going anywhere. Stop. What are you doing? You can't decide if I'm going home. Stop it! Move! Help me! - Help me! - I can't help you. - Help me! - I can't help you! Fine! Leave if you think I'm so fucking deranged! Isak! Isak! What the hell?! Isak! Isak! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry... - Should we continue where we left off? - I want to talk about Em. About Em? You're... You're placing a large pile of red books in front of me. Lots... Lots of books. - I think... - Everything is in there. - Everything, that's a great deal. - You had a relationship. Yes, as in me being her psychologist and she was my client. - That's no secret. - As in your cock in her vagina? You chose "cock" to describe the male sexual organ- - and "vagina", which is more clinical, for the female organ. Do you have any thoughts on why you changed the genre? "He said he loved the secrets, how forbidden it was. That his wife..." Okay, okay... I get it, Felicia. I fully understand what you mean. Fine. Jesus Christ... Nothing we say here will ever leave this room. Are we on the same page there? What is it that you want to know? You're dirty on the outside, but completely pure inside. I'm the other way around. Pure on the outside, but so fucking dirty inside. - Will you tell me about them? - That one? Ever since I was a kid, I've dreamt about being aboard a ship- - and sailing far away. I want a boat too. Right here. - You want me to do it? - Yes. A cool boat. - It could turn out ugly. - No, it can't. - You're laughing because it's shit? - No, I'm surprised how good it is. It's a replica. - It's perfect! Just look. - It's crazy good. - Thanks - It just needs color. - Look for ocean blue. - Or red. - Yeah, that could work. - Right? - What's that? - Hang on... - What's going on? - It's the police. Hold on... What's happening? Fuck! We have to leave. What the hell do we do? Come on, think! Think quickly... Fuck! Yes, Sirenius? Yes, yes, that's my car. Why, did you find it? What...? What are you saying? That can't be right. Is that so? Right, I see... Yes, we're... we're at home. - Goodbye. - What happened? Emilia is wanted by the police. - The police are on their way. - What did she do? I don't know. You've reached voicemail. Please leave a message. Hey, it's Dad... Listen... I'm sorry for what happened, that I... You know. Damn it... Just come home soon and we'll talk. Okay? Goodbye, bye... It's going to be okay. - Who the fuck is that? - I don't know. What the hell does he want? Is it the cops? - What's he want? - I don't know. - Huh? - I don't know! It's gotta be... Why would he flash his headlights? Fuck. He's flashing... You do realize we have to get rid of the car? Someone may have seen it. Damn. - Are you lost? - What? - Are you lost? - Wh... Are we? No. - No! - No, I... No. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Are you driving far today? - No. - Any particular destination? - No... We're... We're just driving around, I think. Just driving and looking around. - Aimlessly down the road. - Exactly. Time for the Västerbotten local news. An older man was burnt to death, and police are investigating- - if it may have been arson. According to the police several witnesses have seen a red... - It's all sad news. - Dig into the coffee bread. - It was yummy! - That car of yours is a beauty. - What do you call that type of roof? - Convertible. - I really like the color. - Yes, it's metallic. Maroon metallic. When I was young, I used to dream about a car with a convertible roof. Our car certainly doesn't have one. - Would you like to trade? - Trade? Yes, would you like to trade cars? What's going on? YOUNG COUPLE SUSPECTED OF ARSON - I have never seen her. - Okay. But can you try to explain why you think he left? I don't know. What do you think? Do you think it was easy to grow up with a broken dad and an absent mom. - Could that be why he's missing? - What! Isn't that your damn job? Are you the cop, or am I? Where did they call from? - That's my question to you. - What? We're wasting time here! - Sure, but calm down. - I am calm! - No, you're not calm. - You're the cop, stop talk, sort it out! - We should be out looking for them. - We're not getting anywhere here. - I'm sorry. - You divorced when he was eight. Could that have made him seek out the wrong group of people? As far as I know... I know many of his friends, and no one is that bad. But of course... things have been rough at home sometimes. I try to be there, to be a good dad, but it isn't easy. His mom was completely fucked up. It wasn't easy. What the hell did he do? We don't know anything yet, so we don't have to go there. He can't have killed someone. Goddamn... It's important that we stay in touch. If Isak gets in touch with you, it's important that you contact us. - Should we try with me pushing? - Yeah. - Push the gas pedal. - I am! - Up, back and forth. - I know! - Damn it... - God damn seniors! They swindled us. One, two... Why did you come along? I've always wanted to just take off. I've never been abroad, for instance. I've never been to Legoland in Denmark like everyone else. I used to lie to my classmates. When everyone got back after summer- - I said I'd been caravaning, just like all the regular families. Do you ever talk to her? She calls every now and then. But it doesn't feel like she's my mom. It's more like she's... a distant relative of some sort. So I may as well not give a shit. Don't cry for Mommy. She can't hear you anyway. - How are you doing, sweetie? - I'm fine. - Good. - And how are you? It is what it is. I can't make any sense of this. There may not be any... simple answers to why people are the way they are. - Why we turn out the way we do... - The psychologist said to talk to you. The psychologist told me to talk to my family. - Is that so? - You don't know why he said that? - Huh? - What's the matter? There is... something I have to tell you. It's about Em. - Okay, spill it! - It's hard. I don't know where to start. Go on, tell me. When she was 8 years old... ...she was left all alone, abandoned... in some flat in Gothenburg. You won't remember this. You were too little at the time. She came to us, and she had been through hell. Your mom and I thought, "we have time, space and money". - We thought she could stay with us. - Was I never to know about this? - Would you ever have told me? - Yes, we would. We tried... - What...? - Easy. You can't take any of the blame. - You can't dig into this. - Someone should take the blame. No, please! Felicia, wait... Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mom... - Shit. And you remember that? - Everything... When you're eight, you're old enough to have a grasp of things... ...but way too young to understand. What was your new family like? Perfect. They're perfect. So perfect that I... have never felt like one of them. Or felt like I'm any good at anything. I've kind of always wanted to go away, until now. - Do you know what's crazy? - No. The crazy thing is... ...after all we've done, and even though we're here- I've never felt this calm. A man and woman in their twenties are wanted by police- - in connection with robberies of country stores, shops and gas stations. Their getaway car, a red Saab, has been found in Styrnäs, Kramfors. The police have warned the public that they are armed and dangerous. They are wanted for robbery, but are also suspected of arson. We can't keep running. They are going to find us. We'll think of something. Try to get some rest. Isak? Isak? - I know what we need to do. - What? They just need to see us do it. - Hello? - Hi, Dad. - Isak? - I am so sorry... ...that things turned out this way. - Hello? - Hi, Felicia. It's me. Where are you? - Hello? - Sometimes there's no way back. What the hell are you talking about? Come home! Don't believe what you read about me, okay? Cut it out, you can't just leave! What the hell are you planning to do? Hello. I'd like to report a stolen car. The registration plate is NMA 404. That's right, a white Volvo 740. A moment to shine. You must know l'm worried. I'm waiting for your call every day. Come home! Isak, listen to me... - Tell me what happened. - It's too late. Nothing is too late. Everything can be fixed. Don't you get that? Think about that, then... I'm out there somewhere. - I don't want to, I just want you here. - I can't come home. I don't care what happened. Just come home and we'll talk. - Forgive me, Dad. - Isak, don't hang up. Damn it! - I have to hang up. - Don't, Em! I'm sorry, sis. Run! Stop! Put the gun down! - I love you. - I love you. One, two... three! One, two, three! I'm sorry, but we had to hold on to it for the forensic analysis. - I understand. - The box is all that was found. The rest must have floated out to sea. I am sorry for your loss. Thank you, we appreciate it. I was 18 and knew nothing of life, but I was crazy in love. She wanted to keep it, so... But then she took off... and left him. A damn stroke of luck; he was my best friend. - Now all I have are those damn shoes. - Mm, same for us. Well, there it is... It's huge. What the hell is that? One of those contrabasses? No... It's a cello. What? Who sent it? - Em. - What? - What are we doing now? - I'm doing nothing. And you? I don't know. What do you want to do? ETERNAL SUMMER FOR YOU, M 1983-2013 Subtitles: Linda Jansson
