Is he gone? There's no way out! The window! Quick! Climb out. Go! Oh God! I'M SLIPPING! Oh my God! C'mon! It's OK. C'mon. Don't drop me. Hold on! I'm slipping! Just reach! I got you. Who are you? Run! Help! Freeze! "Push it out. Shove it out. Get it out. Push it out" "You only got one life to live" "So live it right to the end" Shit! Really? That's why I told my boss to switch to combination locks. You'd be in here every night because you forgot the combination. I thought you were on a diet? Shut up. I need it back. It's the last one. Yeah, yeah. And tell your boss no more boxes ofvending candy it brings rats! Watch that blood pressure old man. Dumb shit. Keith! The key! Dumb shit. Whoa! Take me with you. OK. You can drive. I can't drive stick. Right. I have to go sweetie I'm so late. Muah! Tom! Where's your bag? You're gonna miss the bus. Go on sweetie. Forgot your coffee. We're signing new accounts in Philly so I'll be really late. Well, that's okay. The new mailman's really cute. I'll hurry back. HeyVic. Hi Ellie. You should tell your friend Lynn not to undress by the window. My Dad bought binoculars. I'll tell her. I need you to pull the records for every missing child case in the valley. Sutter's journal mentions a kidnapped boy and based on the entry date he'd be grown by now. I think he might be our suspect. Maybe. but Sutter's imagination didn't chop him up into chop him up into little pieces. Call me. They broke through a wall in the basement. Must be a dozen more! Amazing he got away with it as long as he did. How often do you check on your neighbor, ask to see his basement? Anything? Still no answer. Let's go in person. The witness didn't want to talk before. What makes you think she's gonna talk now? There's still four hundred grand missing. I have a feeling she knows where it is. She'll talk. Oh my God I didn't sleep at all last night because of that stupid dog barking next door! Oh. I was gonna help you with those. You were gonna take the garbage out too. I don't like you in the morning. You know rent's due? Again!? Every month. Shit. Hi, it's me. It's Lynn you shit! Put Dad on the phone. Hey wait up! Classes start in 15 minutes. 15 minutes! I'm trying. Hi Daddy. I'm out of money. Mrs. Harrison. Mrs. Harrison. They found the victim's wallet in the backyard. He tracked em' down. Maybe stole a car. What about the money? There's over 300 grand in that bag. He wasn't looking for the money. They crossed his path. Agent Perkins, the reports you asked for. Thanks. That's him. We need to contact his immediate family right away. You think he's our killer? I know he is. Hello? You what? Yep. Still here. Okay, I'll bring it up in a bit but tell Mrs. Gordon thank you for letting you call OK? Ok. I'll see you soon. Bye. Vibrato! Very intense. Shh... Jason! More vibrato. Ellie, you need to work on those double stops. Come on guys let's get it together the concert's tomorrow night. Let's go. Ellie! Ellie wait. Get lost. C'mon. Don't do this. Ellie. Ellie! I gotta go guys. Bye. Ellie. Ellie wait up. Oh my God so this morning this loser kicked a hacky... sack right into my face. I hate this college, it's like the 13th grade. Come on, it was a miscommunication that's all. John, you lied to me. Come on, you know how I feel about you. You should have told me when it mattered. Ellie wait! Are you crazy? Do you know how valuable this is? It was my grandfather's. I want to see surveillance tapes for the past 24 hours. Get the make and model of the victim's vehicle and get it on TV and radio. We need every eyeball out there. Go! Mother's name is Katherine Bristol. Divorced. Her most recent address... Minersville. 30 miles north of here. Stay here. Make sure these locals don't destroy all the evidence. Do you want me to call ahead? No. This isn't the kind of news you impart over the phone. Elle, can you do the laundry? Elle, can you take out the garbage? Elle, can you feed my cats? Forget about me? What? It's the 3rd. We didn't forget. We're a little short at the moment. You'll get your money. You know, if money's a problem... there's other ways we can settle a tab. Right? Ugh! Fine. Now I want cash! Cash? I don't have it. Well go get it. I can't. I have things to do. How about you fix the washer and dryer? Mow the lawn? I'm working on it. Ellie! Yeah? Hi. My parents wired me the money... $400. I don't know if it shows how much they love me or how much they don't want me back home. I'm sure it's love. Yeah right. So I'm meeting Carl for drinks. You should come out. The concert's tomorrow. I have to practice. OK, well whatever. I tried. That's turning out great. Really? I think it sucks. I think I'm gonna tear it apart. Can I have it? Yeah... for $400. I got your money! Ahh. Hey. You hungry? There ya go. Bye—bye! Ellie! You scared me. Oh, I'm sorry. My trip got cancelled. I forgot to call. No it's all right. Can I get you something to drink? No thanks. I gotta get back. Ah, the recital tomorrow right? Yup. Well now that I'm home I can go. I'll be there front row. Thanks Elle. Sorry. It's OK. Ellie! Why are you walking this way? I told Mrs. Pritchett I'd feed her cats while she was away. But I just saw her. Yeah, I know. What about you? I always walk home this way. What about the bus? I hate the bus. They spit gum in my hair. So, you coming to my birthday party? Am I invited? Duh! I just did. Sure, I'd love to. Great! No gifts cards, make an effort. Bye! Bye! Mom? Mom? Mom? You never brought my lunch. Mom? LMB Industries, how may I help you? Hi is Dad... is Mr Stewart there? Who's calling? Victoria. Just a moment. He's in a meeting. Would you like me to page him? No. Talk about your good news, bad news. Where to begin? We have to approach this delicately. Got it! You wait here. Yes? Mrs. Bristol? Yes. Mrs. Katherine Bristol. You mean my daughter? May I speak with her? What's this about? Special Agent William Perkins. It's about her son, Martin. She's working. May I come in? So, it's just you and your daughter living here? What about Martin? What's going on? We believe Martin is still alive. And we believe he may try to locate Katherine. Oh my God. This is some sort of miracle! I need to speak with Katherine in person. No. No. No. You don't understand. She's been waiting 10 years for this moment. It's complicated. What's going on? What aren't you telling me? We're here to keep you safe. Safe from what? Ma'am. Where can I find Katherine? Hello? Hey, we're gonna go to the tavern for drinks, you should come with us. I have to practice. You never come out. Come out loser! Larry left without taking his money. Bring it with you the bartender's cute. Well, don't you think that's weird? Just come out. Come out loser. Screw John! Okay maybe. Hello? Hello. I just want to talk to you. What the hell? Well I knew that you'd hang up so I thought I'd... So you break into my house? The front door was open! I could have you arrested. Aw, come on I love you. You don't even know me. Yeah, yeah I do! I know you. Come on, wait up. Hey, wait! Hey! C'mon. I know you. I mean, I know you love your music and I love classical music too. Name one classical composer? Mozart. Name another. The deaf guy. Wait, wait Ellie! Come on. Ellie wait up! Ellie! Ellie stop! I got you something. They're real. I sold my Les Paul. It's beautiful. Why don't you give them to Goldilocks? What? Are you crazy? Ellie come on. Don't be like that. Get lost! Come on Ellie! Kathy, there's some men here who want to speak with you. They're from the FBI. He was held captive in a farmhouse outside Ironton Township. I always knew he was alive. Martin was subjected to unspeakable physical and mental abuse. You're his only connection to the outside world. We believe he may try to locate you. Well then I need to go home. You don't understand, this is not a rational person. Your son is a killer. He's extremely dangerous. I don't believe you. Your son tracked down and murdered the only witnesses who could identify him. That's what he was taught. How to kill... and cover his tracks. I wouldn't be putting you through this if I didn't believe that you might be in danger. Martin needs me. He needs my help. We have to find him first. Will you help us? Excuse me ladies. Hey, Laurie, can I get another pitcher of beer? Hi! Hi! I can't believe you threw that diamond bracelet in the trash. I did. Good for you. You should've called the cops. Whoa, called the cops? God, what I'd miss? Simon, do you have any nice friends for Ellie? She's on the rebound. That's okay. Yeah, what's your type? She's old fashioned. Oh yeah? Yeah. I like things like honesty, respect, sensitivity... Mmm... she likes girls? Ahhh... Simon has a slight neurological brain disorder known as small. Guys, it's Carl Schmidt. He's pre—med. Scoot out, Hilda. Hi Carl! So did something happen with John? Ellie caught him messing around with Amanda Ryan. Amanda? Well, she's a tramp. Hey, it takes two! Well, if Amanda wants a guy for herself, She knows how to screw things up. Whatever. All right let me guess. She's the one that told you all about it right? How he came on to her and she tried to stop him and blah, blah, blah right? So? Did you believe her? Trust me, Amanda is a huge skank. OK? So loose I'm surprised her guts don't fall out. And how do you know so much about her? She try to get with you? Aww, c'mon. Listen, I know John. He's a good guy. Maybe I was too hard on him. What? You only told him to drop dead, never call you again and then you dumped the diamond bracelet in the trash. You should talk to him. You have reached the voice mailbox of... John. Okay I'm sorry. You were right. I should have let you explain. I'm ready to talk now. Call me. Ellie? What happened? Did John do this? Who else? Did you paint all these? Yeah. They're great. Thanks. Police say leads in the brazen bank robbery yesterday in Whitehall Township are what led to the grisly discovery here in this dilapidated pig farm just outside rural Ironton Township. So far authorities have retrieved over 23 victims. The names of which are being withheld pending notification of their families. The dismembered corpse of the owner Graham Sutter was found nailed to a barn wall. Police and federal authorities suspect Sutter might have had an accomplice. What? I'm sorry. I'm just not in the mood. Well, can you at least lend me a hand? Gross! What? What's the problem? Hey, you OK? Yeah. How are you gonna play tomorrow? I'll work it out. So what kind of doctor are you studying to be? Heart? Neuro? RN. A nurse? Yeah. What? I'll take the ring back and the finger too. From director Harry Penderecki comes an engagement in terror. Victoria? What's the matter? She wasn't there when I got home. I looked everywhere. Where's your Dad? At work. Has she ever left you at home alone before? Ok. Come on. Do you want me to go with you? No. It's OK. So what do you want for your birthday? Money. Money huh? How much? How much you got? Hey, don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine. Wait here. I told you she's not here. Sometimes people slip and fall. I was just making sure. I should probably go. I gotta get up early. Yeah, OK. What? No, it's fine. I have to finish my paper anyway. Alright. I'll call you in the morning. Details are still sketchy but apparently the discovery had some connection with the brazen bank robbery that took place yesterday. Federal and local authorities have descended on the home of Graham Sutter, whose dead body was found upstairs in a morbid, semi—preserved state. Are you mad at me? No. I gotta go. You gotta finish your paper. OK. Call me tomorrow. OK. Ahh! Where's Simon? He left. Left? He was my ride. My car's back at the tavern. Your car? I thought you were staying. So did I. Where's Ellie? Doesn't she have a car? She's not here either. Well would she mind if I borrowed it? Yes. Fine. See you around. See ya. Haven't you heard the story about the free milk and the cow? Hmm. We could all be dead tomorrow. Maybe you should rethink your major. Maybe psychology isn't for you. Mm—hmm. What!? Simon? Simon? Are you guys goofing on me? Are you guys goofing around? Jesus. Look out. Ugh, Old Spice. Yuck! Hello? Ellie? What? Where's Vic? She's here with me. She's fine. I'm on my way back now in about an hour or two. Would you mind keeping an eye on her until I get back? Sure, of course. Thanks so much Ellie. No problem. OK. Bye. Your Dad's on his way home. I'm gonna stay with you till he gets back. You know they're just here for your protection. It reminds me of when Martin first disappeared. They came to my house, they drank my coffee, asked me questions over and over. Like what was he wearing? Was I sure he didn't run away? The pain of knowing someone is out there you love and you can't reach out to them to tell them how much you love them. I guess you wouldn't understand. Before I joined the FBI I was in the military. I was stationed overseas a lot. I saw pictures of my son being born. I didn't get to hold him till he was 2 and then only for a few months. Before I knew it he was a young man, who never knew his dad, and by then didn't want to. Where is he now? Atlanta. I just haven't had a... I wouldn't know what to say to him. All points have checked in. We got nothing. Tell them to stay vigilant. Lynn? That's exactly what I mean, right? Ha. Very funny! You guys need to get a life. You're letting me win. Maybe. You can't be that stupid. This is boring. Let's play hide and seek. Let's not. Hello. Have you heard from John yet? No, he's not answering his phone. Why? What is it? Well his bike is on the side of the house. What?! Are you sure? Yeah, I just saw it. Everything OK over there? Yeah. I'm gonna stay here until her Dad gets home. No sign of her Mom yet? No. OK well, let me know if you need anything. I'm going to try calling him again. Are we gonna play or not? Foucault did ask about controlling society... via... knowledge and power. Tara you're a genius. Officer? Thank you. Agent Roland? Oh, no thank you. Do you mind if I smoke? No, not at all. My husband smoked until the day he died. Of course, I had to light them for him once they amputated his fingers. I had to hold his thing so he wouldn't piss on himself when he went to the bathroom. He probably would have complained if he still had his voice box. Who's this? My husband. Where is he now? He passed away, in an accident. I'm sorry. I couldn't afford the house so.. we moved back here with my mother. Moved? When? About three months before Martin was taken. Where were you prior to this? New Hope. I need that address! You're gonna kill him, aren't you? Not if I don't have to. Agent Perkins! They found the van! Service road off the interstate. Get in. Take me with you. Can't do that. You'll be safer here. New Hope is 10 miles north of where the stolen van was found. He might have switched vehicles. Get the local police on the line. I can't believe he lied to me. A doctor! Yeah, right. He's taking one of those night classes that you see in the Penny Saver. I don't know. Sarah told me. I know, she's an idiot! Oh, and driving his Dad's car... can you believe that? Ew and I let him kiss me. Ugh. Yeah, I guess it's Sarah's revenge for when I set her up with that Korean guy. I know. Oh that bitch. OK. I'll talk to you later. Bye. But we didn't finish the game. I just have to check on something. Tara? Tara? Tara? Can we go back and finish the game? Yeah, give me just a minute. I'm thirsty. There's drinks in the fridge. Lynn? Carl? Vic? Hello? Ellie? Yes. It's John's sister, Brooke. Hi. We've been trying to reach John all night. He's not answering his phone. We were wondering if he was with you. No. He was here but he left. He was pretty upset when I talked to him earlier. You could say that! Well, if you hear from him can you tell him to please call us? Sure. Bye. Vic? Vic? Boo! That's not funny. OK, now it's your turn to hide. Not now. You said we could play. Yeah I know, but... Come on. OK. You hide. OK. Count to ten. I'll count to twenty. Go! One... Two... Three... John? Are you down here? Tara? Tara, I'm coming in. Tara? Victoria! Lynn? OH MY GOD! VICTORIA? VIC? Ha, ha, you couldn't find me. John? GET OFF! NO! No. I'm scared. STOP! VICTORIA! NOOOO! GO AWAY!! HEY! Mr. Stewart? It's OK. Daddy! Call the police. I think I broke his neck. Is anyone else in the house? Go get in the car! Go! GO!!!! Duck down. NO! HELP! NO! HELP! Stop! RUN! MRS. PRITCHETT! OPEN THE DOOR! MRS. PRITCHETT OPEN THE DOOR! MRS. PRITCHETT! Oh God. Girls, what's wrong? Just call the police. What's going on? Please just call the police. What happened? JUST CALLTHE POLICE! Yes, I'd like to report an emergency. Send the police. Hurry! My address is 601 Liberty Street. Hello? Hello?! The lines dead. What's going on? Lock the doors. He's gonna kill us. Who's going to kill you? Stay here. Ellie. Stay behind me. Let's just go. Mrs. Pritchett? Stay back. I think I got him. VIC? VIC? Vic? Vic? NO! NO! Jones. A 911 call came in but it was cut off. They managed to trace it to 601 Liberty Street. That's right around the corner from here. No! No! Whoa! Whoa! It's OK. It's alright. Drop it Martin. DON'T MOVE! Are you alright Miss? Ellie! Vic. It's gonna be OK. I need an ambulance right away, Shit. He's on foot. He's wounded. I want a ten square mile area sealed off. Let's go! It's a slaughterhouse in there. Anyone left alive? Just one. Daddy? Vic! Oh my God! I thought you were dead! Are you Okay? I'm so sorry. Go! You must be exhausted sweetheart. You've gotta get some rest. It's just not fair. I know. But you've got to stay strong. It's gonna be OK. I love you. I love you too. The suspect, Martin Bristoll was shot by Agent William Perkins but somehow managed to elude capture. A statewide manhunt is now underway. I spoke to Agent Perkins earlier. The subject remains at large and is extremely dangerous. We're doing everything to apprehend him. Excuse me. Martin? Oh no! Katherine, are you alright? Yes. I'm Okay. I'm making some tea, would you like some? I just came to say goodnight. I'm going to bed. Goodnight. Detective Perkins called again. I told him you'd call back when you were ready. Did they find my phone? No, they didn't. You OK? Did you have enough to eat? Yes. You sure? Mom... I'm fine. Alright honey. Goodnight. Come on girl.
