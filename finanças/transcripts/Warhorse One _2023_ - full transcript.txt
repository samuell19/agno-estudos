Dave, I have Mike Stevens calling again. Connecting you now. Sorry, I got your message. We're just a little bit busy around here right now. What can I do for you? Yeah, Dave. Listen, I need your help. I need you to help me to get a group of missionaries out of Pakistan. Missionaries? Come on, Mike. I've got thousands of people trying to escape the country. Three administrations we kept this thing together, and this one just wants to walk away and let the enemy take over the country. So now they're hitting us with everything they've got, just as we're trying to pull out and claim some kind of victory. I... I know. I know. You can't tell me that these people didn't know the risks when they went in there. Look, you're just going to have to tell them to bag it up and get out. They're Americans. Americans? Americans. This ministry brought this guy and his family over here to start a church in this little village called Sarad. We've been using them to coordinate the evacuation of these ANSF interpreters. But they just... they stayed too long. Mike... look, you didn't hear this from me, but they're pushing hundreds of insurgents into that area. They've already hit the embassy in Cabel, government buildings, police stations. They're even trying to dig into the surrounding villages. It's like the TET offensive out there. The media is saying it's the Taliban, but these guys are getting trucked in from Pakistan, Syria... They're cleansing everything, Mike. This guy is risking his family's life for us. It may not mean anything to you, but it does to me. I need help. Let me see what I can do. Just showed up. We made it very clear. We told them to evac the area immediately. He says he's leaving tomorrow morning. Tell them to get on the road right now. He says he's not leaving until he evacuates everyone from the village. - Hold up, hold up. All right, there is a SOCOM operation in a village in Kunar. Let me see if I can move them. Get you an escort and extraction. Thank you. Thank you. This is filing with me. Soldiers... All right, I need that intel, Mike. What do you got for me? Roger that. All told, I've got six of them traveling... Yeah. Hit me. Logan. Make sure you get all the drives. The Reverend Mathew William Walters, white male, age 45. His wife Rasheeda Walters, female, 41, born in Kabul, Afghanistan, naturalized American in '07 when wed to Walters. And their kids. All right. William Arthur Walters, male, age 13... and Zoe Elizabeth Walters, female, age five. They got their support staff, Rami Ahmadi and Majida Ibrahimi. - 'K. Come on, guys. We gotta go. We got all six traveling right now in a dark green '93 Trooper. Hey. You watch yourself over there. Sir, we're out of clock. We gotta move. Showed up. Commander Johns, I've got six American missionaries traveling through the Kunar Province. They're in a green Trooper. They were making a run for the Pakistani border. We just heard from them. They got turned around and they're lost. We need to send a unit to link up with them ASAP. With me, please. We need help. We need help, please. RPG! RPG! I don't know if things happen for a reason. If it's fate, destiny, or the hand of God. Team Warhorse, this is Warhorse One. Give me a sit rep. Over. Team Warhorse, I say again, this is Warhorse One. What's your status? Over. Pataskie...

I was separated from the helo when we were hit, but I am on my feet. I am good to go. I have contacted my team. I get no comeback on comms. Are there any guns up at the crash site? I say again, is anyone moving, how copy? Solid copy, Warhorse. We have eyes on the crash site due east of your current position. It looks like the helo broke up on impact. We have no observable movement on FLIR or comms coming from the crash site. Over. I say again, the crash site is due east of your POS. Over. How copy? Over. Solid copy, Castle. I am moving to the crash site to verify. I've got tangos at 500 meters to the north. They are pushing the crash site. I am moving to intercept. Over. Negative, Warhorse. I say again, the helo broke up on impact. Disengage. Negative, Castle. Those are my men in that helo, and if there are any survivors, I'm not leaving them up here to die. You have a significant aggressor force advancing from your northeast. Disengage! We have no movement, no signatures, no guns up, you have no close air support. Disengage, fall back, find cover. Oh, they hit them again. I'm moving to intercept. I'm going to pull them off the crash site. Mirko out! Negative, Warhorse. Disengage. Somebody get me Johns! Go get 'em, Master Chief. Let's go. Gotcha. Castle to Warhorse. Warhorse, do you copy? Warhorse, this is Castle. Come in, Warhorse. Go for Warhorse. Over. [over comms] Be advised, you have tangos advancing on your position. Over.

Mirko, do you copy? Commander. Master Chief, you have seconds here and they're evaporating fast. We're looking at the crash site right now. Your team is gone. I don't see anybody moving down there. You're on your own, son. Either you break contact and get moving... or you're going to die on that mountain. I can live with that. I can live with that. Yeah, but I don't want to, son. I don't need to lose all my guys today. Fall back, come back here, re-group, and we'll go back in and bring our boys home. You owe them that. How copy? Understand, Master Chief? Mirko, do you copy? Copy, Commander. Falling back. Mirko out. Lieutenant. Reece! Get Vanzant on the horn. Find out about assets for a QRF. I want my frogman off that mountain. And talk to those Air Force guys. Tell 'em to sort their shit out. We need eyes on this doggone mess. Yes, sir. Come on, fuckers. Warhorse, this is Castle. Do you copy, Warhorse? Over. Castle, this is Warhorse. Not a good time... No, fuck that. I'm a frogman. You can't drown me. You can't drown me. Walters. Help... help me... help me... Walters. Relax now. - Help me. Help me. Help me. - Walters. All right, relax. Please. Not me! Not me. Her. Her. Help her. Her. Shit. Shit. Zoe? Ssssh, Mama's sleeping. Are you Zoe? Mama says we're going to be okay. We're going here. No, we're not going there yet. You see that? That's where it's safe. Up there? Yeah, and my friends are coming to meet us. We have to wait until she wakes up. We should let her sleep. It's okay. She'll meet us up there. We gotta go now. It's okay. Come on. Kid, let's go. You're not my papa. Listen, kid. When all this is over, we can be friends. Until then, I'm in charge. Got it? Move out. Hey, that's mine. Yeah, and if somebody spots it, it will give away our position. You can take this one. Papa says guns don't solve problems. Yeah. That's why you always carry a knife. He told me you can't fight evil stuff with evil stuff. Kid, I'm one of the good guys. Those guys back there that hurt your papa, those are the bad guys. Why, because they're Muslims? I don't care what they believe in. If you're intentionally killing innocent people, then you're the bad guys. Come on. We gotta go. Kid, don't move... You see this? This is why you don't run around like a wild girl. There's tons of bad stuff like this out here. Okay. What is it? It's a bad thing. When that pin comes out, it sets this fuse off that detonates this bomb. Oh. Listen, no matter what you see, or what you hear, if I put you somewhere, you stay there and you stay quiet. 'Cause of the bad guys? Yeah. Yeah, because of the bad guys. All right, we should get out of here. Psst! Now go. You're bleeding. It's not mine. Come on, we gotta go. Come on! You left me. You left me. I'm sorry, kid. It won't happen again. Promise? Promise. Let's go. Come on, kid. It's okay, they're gone. What? They killed Billy. The one with the hat. The one with the scar. I'll remember 'em. All right, come on. We should go. Hey. I'll be right back. No, wait! It's okay. I'm just going to go take a peek at the next ridge. We made a promise. Sit here, don't move, and don't make a sound. Castle, this is Warhorse One, do you copy? Over. Castle, this is Warhorse One. Do you read me? Over. Warhorse, this is Castle. We have you Lima Charlie, how copy. Over. Good copy, good fucking copy. Over. [over comm] Bad comms. Over. Roger. Command needs a sit rep. What's your status? I have a heavy aggressor force hunting me and my AO. I need immediate evac. Over. Roger that. What is your current pos? I am one kilometer past Giants pushing to Raiders. I have one mission objective. I say again, I have one small objective, need immediate extraction. How copy? [over comm] Good copy on the objective, updating now. We have no air assets available in theater. Looking for birds to allocate your direction but you will have to stand by. We are dealing with heavy TIC at this time. Roger that. I'll wait for further. Over. We understand the urgency of your situation. You will have to stand by. Hold what you got, and we will contact you no later than zero six with exfil, how copy? Oh six hundred, Castle? Affirmative, Warhorse. That's the best we can do at this time. Roger that, Castle. Advise if you can implement sooner. Warhorse One out. Roger. Castle out. Reece, what's the word on Vanzant? No word yet, sir. Give me a phone. I'll call him myself. Whatcha doing? A little surprise for the bad guys. Come on, it's time to rack out. Are we going to die? No, we're going to be just fine. We just have to make it to the top of that mountain. How did you know I was here? We were in the area looking for someone. Looking for a bad guy? Yeah, looking for a bad guy. Then we got the redirect that your family was trying to escape the area, so we came looking for you. We? Yeah, my friends and I. Where are your friends now? Our helicopter was shot down. What about you? I fell out before it crashed. You fell from the sky? Like an angel? I'm no angel. You're my angel. I hope the bad guys don't get us. They won't. Time for bed, kid. Can you tell me a story? A story, huh? What kinda story? I like superheroes. Superheroes, huh? I got a hero story for ya. It's about the bravest man I've ever met. Aziz Latiri. He was a Muslim. One day... No, once upon a time. Okay. Once upon a time, in a faraway place called Kirkuk, me and my friends were pinned down and surrounded by enemies. And it didn't look good for us. I didn't think we were gonna make it out. And all of a sudden, a truck pulled up, and a guy jumped out, a peshmerga fighter, and he gave us cover and allowed me and my friends to get outta there. At first I thought he was just crazy. And then I realized he was just really brave. He saved our lives that day. Rest your soul, Aziz. Rest your soul. Team Warhorse. Change of plans, boys. Robin Hood is a push. We have a new objective. We need an immediate extraction of U.S. citizens. They are traveling in a green Trooper heading east on Nangala Road. Six friendlies. William Walters, male, 45. Rasheeda Walters, female, 41. Child, William, male, 13. Child, Zoe, female, five. Hostiles have been spotted in the area. Good luck, Mirko. Junior, you good? Relax, kid. One minute, boys. RPG! RPG! Wake up. Wake up, kid. Let's go. Who's that? Snap out of it, kid. We gotta go. Kid! Snap out of it, let's go! We gotta go. Go ahead. Ha! Come here. Grip it tight. That way, in case you gotta swing, it won't fall outta your hand. When you're ready to throw it, loosen your grip, imagine you're cutting through your target, and drive the tip of that blade right into the center of that target. Got it? - Ha! Better. Now try it with this. It's okay. Ha! Not bad, kid. Get your bag. It's nothing. It's nothing. No. What's that? It's gum. Chew it. Don't swallow it. Good, huh? Mm-hm. What's her name? It's a boy. What's his name? Louie. Louie. That's a good name. Billy says it's a dumb name. A noonkie name. Noonkie name, huh? I like it. Mama told me when we got back to America, she would get me a real Louie. I miss Mama. I know. I know she's not sleeping. She's gone, like Papa and Billy. It's just a part of life, kid. Everybody dies. Even us? Yeah. But not here. Not yet. I'm gonna get us outta here. Pst. It's very dangerous here. Where is your Papa and Mama? You shouldn't be here by yourself. I'm not. I'm with him. Please, don't shoot. I... I'm a simple goat herder, searching my goat. This is a dangerous place. You shouldn't be here. Drop that Burner, fucker. Here. Take it, take it. I use it for protection against the Daesh bastards. I can help you get out of here. My village is not too far from here. Right in the next valley, huh? Yes, I will help. Come, I help. Turn around. You look in the wrong direction, I will fucking kill you, you understand? I help you. I help you. I help you. Go. The village is not far from here. My village. Daesh came in a few days ago, like a brush fire. They left and now they back again. You from here? No, from Pakistan, but my papa move us here when I was a boy. So no, I was not born here. But I will die here, inshallah. What about you, my friend? Why are you here? Just visiting. Very dangerous place to visit by yourself. Yeah, the world's a dangerous place. Warhorse, this is Castle. How copy, over. - Even for Special Forces. - Shut the fuck up. Go for Warhorse. Over. [over comms] Roger, Warhorse. Good copy. Over. Yeah, you're late. Over. Roger that, Warhorse. Sketchy comms on our end at this time. We do have a 160th air asset available out of Jalalabad. Outstanding, Castle. I have the package in tow, and we are heading to the exfil. Over. Roger, Warhorse. What is your current pos? We are four kilometers past Raiders, ready to go home. Over. Do you have exfil grid? Over. Three-five-five, how copy. Over. Got it, confirmed. Confirmed extract at three-five- five, how copy? Roger that. Warhorse out. Roger, Warhorse. Castle out. Good news? Yeah, you could say that. Oh, good, good. I am happy for you. Hey, kid. You ready to go home? Stay down, kid. Aaah! Aaah! Kid. Kid! All right, kid. All right, kid. Don't be afraid, little child. I won't hurt you. What is your name? What is this? It's Papa's. Oh, it's nice. Zoe? No! No! No! No! Oh! Oh, the girl. She is close. I will take you. Up. Hold. What the fuck are you guys doing? Showtime, big boy. Allah Akbar. There is a storm coming. Junior? Kobe? Where is she? Never you worry about her. You know, I admire your strength. It must be very painful to be here all alone, with none of your soldiers to help you. Jarrah. Tell me when and where your helicopter is coming for you. And I'll let you live. What helicopter? Do you think you are playing with me? So I tell you where my helicopter is coming, so you can kill more of my men. You have killed thousands of my brothers. Civilians. Innocent women, children. For what? For the poppies, the pipelines? Or just another financed puppet government? I think it's just to kill shitheads like you. Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. Slaughtered invaders throughout history. Alexander, the Khans, the Persians, British, Soviets, and the West will suffer the same fate. You American scum. Sending assassins to kill us in our peaceful villages. This ain't your village, asshole. It is now. And you ain't from Afghanistan... but you're gonna die here. And so will you, American. And so will you. You like, little girl? You like? You like, little girl? Come. Come. Come. Come! Peeky boo! Peeky boo! You are both going to die for your transgressions today. Zoe? This is mine, fucker. Warhorse One, this is Castle. Over. Listen, Master Chief, I'm not sure if you're reading this, but there's a large group of reinforcements inbound on the village. Any luck, Reece? Negative contact, sir. How close are those reinforcements? If he's in the village, sir, they're almost on top of him. Aaah! Papa! Hey, kid. I told you I'd never leave you. We gotta go. We gotta go. All right, come on. Stay down, kid. Stay! Ears! Come on. Come on, get up. Go! Come on. Get behind the plates. Get behind the vest. Get behind the plates. Okay. Come on. It's okay, we'll be okay. No, it's okay. It's okay. You're my angel. You're my angel. You're my angel. We're going to be okay. You're my angel. On line! On line! On line! On line! On line! Mirko... look at me, brother. Eyes on me. Are you hit? Yeah, my back. Woodsy! We're going critical. We need to get the fuck off the x. No, the girl. Get the girl outta here. The package. I got the package. Roach! Little help! Clean, 150 meters, two o'clock. I don't have a shot. [over comms] Looks like these guys are buggin' out and going home, chief. You're clear to move. Roger that! Clean! Take us out. Move! Let's go, let's go!!! Reaper, this is Bladerunner. We have a full head count. We're headed to your pos now. Over. I still don't know if things happen for a reason. Whether it's fate, destiny, or the hand of God. But what happened that day changed me. I lost a piece of myself that day. But I also gained something. Someone. Someone who reminded me that the things in life worth living for... are worth dying for. I could never replace the family she lost, but Louie and I will do our best. She's my everything now. She's my family. And for the brothers I lost that day... for them, there will be a reckoning.
