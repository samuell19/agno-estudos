Aris, Aris! I hope you're not having one of your fits! - No. I think I'm lost. - How so? I don't know where to turn off for the airport. Let's go back to the party. We'll get the next flight. I want to get out of here now. You' re mad and I love it. Here... Turn here. Think so? In this city, you always have to turn somewhere. - I adore you. - Me too. You'd be lost without me. - Fuck! now we'll never make it. - That's what you think. - Hand me the coke. - What for? - Hand it over. - What's your problem? Here! What are you doing? Aris stop! That's all we've got! Stop, Aris, stop! Aris stop, I'm telling you... REAL LIFE It really is the deepest pool in Europe! Did you locate the problem? The water circulation vent is probably out. We'll need special equipment. We don't know what's inside. It's old and probably rotten. When was it made? In the 50s or 60s? I'll let you know within the week. A NEW BEGINNING IS ALWAYS A GOOD BEGINNING Yes, I am a recluse, not 'cause I hate people but... 'cause I love them desperately. I chose an intense, deep, revolutionary life... but with lightness and humour. A life where, as in art... the incursion of the wonderful, the pervasive atmosphere... the triumph of the lie over truth would be... ...its very meaning! We've been over this before. Shall we go back to the facts? The facts, Sylvia? You know the facts. You can write them yourself. You returned to your house at Sounio for one night. Yes, to that damned house. Father was giving a party right here, in this garden. As usual at the last moment he changed his mind and didn't come. - Your husband? - Who else? - Those days were a nightmare. - Why? I never knew. He was heading in a direction of his own. One that was to lead him to his final fall. Literally. When I returned late at night... I found him lying dead, as we all know... at the foot of the staircase. That's all. Let's drop this story. Whom could it interest? Me. - Aris! - Yes, Mom. Were we expecting you today? Sylvia! Come! Sit! We're through. This biography is turning into a horror story. Welcome back, Aris. So, where was I that night? The official story was that you stayed in Hydra. Remember? How could a five year old remember a night in Hydra? I remember nothing of those years. You're lucky. ever forget that! So you were in there quite a while this time, no? - Six months. - Six months! - Some water! - Must have been some detox! I had time to think. What did you think about? About myself, you... about all the things I can't remember. Like the house at Sounio. The best thing that happened to that house was the '81 'quake! - Is that when you sold it? - Yes! And then they built a hotel, right? Christos, come! Look who's here! - Are you well? - Fine. - Where have you been? - ever mind... - I missed you. - So did I. I see you haven't forgotten sign language! And you, I see always true to tradition. Religiously. Isn't medical science wonderful! Keeping us always so zesty and alive. Yes, alive! I'm so glad you're back. To your return! And you? How are you? Always trying to find time for myself but nobody lets me. Sylvia torments me with this biography. Had I known, I'd have written it myself. Then again, it's the house which is getting old... The eternal business with the pool... This city that intoxicates you, even from a distance. Whose triviality has a sensual grandeur. All these things which never let you lead a real life! Sylvia? Did you jot that down? Doing anything tonight? SOUNIO Street's closed, turn right. - How can I get to Sounio? - o idea. Move on and turn. A THROW OF THE DICE CAN NEVER CALL OFF CHANCE Leave me alone! Get lost! Please, listen to me! Sweetie, that doesn't look like no bottom of the sea. Plus, people are supposed to be looking at our clothes... not the octopuses. - They are not octopuses. - Whatever. Come again tomorrow and we'll see what we can do. Bye, sweetie. - Are you OK? - Yes, fine. You're bleeding. It's nothing. What's your name? Alexandra. Aris. Stay with me for a while. If you want to... - It's that young man. - Aris' friend. - I'll have him sent away. - Don't you dare! Aris will be so happy to see him. - I'm not sure. - Why? He needs to have some fun. He's so sweet. But why should he be so accident prone? I thought you were inside. I haven't been here in years. Since you were a kid. - How is it? - What? That. - Better. It was nothing. - Let me see. You don't need this. I'll change it. What was the house in Sounio like? What do you mean? - It was white inside, right? - Yes. Why do you ask? - I'm trying to remember. - You were very young. My Dad? Was he as horrible as they say he was? - I didn't know him well. - Did he love me? Is there a father who doesn't love his child? ...then again how one expresses that love! What a mess this place is. All these things. But that's Christos' charm. I detest objects. I never keep anything. They depress me. I was going for a walk in the garden. Will you join me? o, I was about to go out. But I do hope we get a chance to talk soon. Goodbye Christos. Hello Nikos. - Where've you been? - I was in an accident. - You OK now? - Yes. - You've changed. - What about you? I've been looking for you. - I owe you money, right? - Yes. Sorry man but the way things happened... - Is it OK? - I was really pissed off at you. I got fuck ed for this money. I mean it. - Well, I'm off. - Where to? - Don't you want a hit? - ah, I'll pass. - You sure? I got good stuff. - I've been clean for 6 months. - No way! - Really. Your loss... I'm off. See you around. - Have you been waiting long? - Is 27 years long? Is this where they teach you how to construct sea depths? This is where I study fashion. The sea depths I construct to earn money. - Was it that bad? - It made me stop. - The sea depth? - What else? - Does it hurt? - A lot. FAR AWAY - Where do you want to go? - Far away. Some place we don't know. Listen, darling, you know how long I've been waiting? - Fuck me... will you? - Here we go again. Hi, Mom. Will this be enough? - Hello. How are we today? - Fine, honey, and you? Yeah, in five, over there, OK. Five people are going nuts waiting and you're being a jerk. - Shut up, you're being a pain. - You're losing it! Cut up! If you're going back there, I'm out of here. You don't say! I got goosebumps! Cut up the stuff. - Where's the phone cards? - In the drawer. I said the first drawer! You just said the drawer, alright? What are you doing? Are you mad? Leave some for the others! - What's your problem? - Mine? Dick! My dick, other dicks. What's yours? Yannis, cut it out, I'm not in the mood. When are you gonna dump that prick? He ain't even a gay. I'll be the judge of that. Yeah, alright. A blowjob with 2 grams of coke at 5am... I've seen the movie. Lay off or there will be trouble. You won't tell me who I like and who I don't. So cut it out! You are hurting me. Let go... And they call me a crazy bitch... What are you looking at? Your eyes. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. I have my eyes shut. Did we fall asleep? A REMARKABLE EVENT Sylvia! Sylvia! - Calm down. What's wrong? - A fish... A fish leaped out! What? I thought you might want it. The house at Sounio? Don't need to tell your mom. I won't. Don't worry. Thanks. AT "L' APOCALYPSE" - Shall we go dancing? - Where? Someplace we don't know. Just Coke? Why? Because when I drink I become a different person that's why. - Meaning? - Better drop it. Let's go. Yiorgos! Your papers. Thank you Mr Kalligas. You may go. Mr Kalligas? You're asking for the impossible. You forget we're at war. I'm asking you to think with your heart, Eric... For once... Hi, Mom. Where were you? You are late. Were you with Eric? Why don't you tell your mother? Eric is a good boy and he loves you. We've got two children, Eric, and they're in danger... He may be rough but he has a heart of gold. Yes Mom, I know... And don't forget you have two children together. Hey you! How about hello? - I can see you're busy. - Where've you been? What's this older brother routine all of a sudden? I am your older brother. ik o, I am tired, I want to go to bed. - What have you got against me? - You're strung out like a wire. - Is that what bothers you? - That too. - What do you want? - I just wanna talk. Me too... But we can't when you're like this and you're always like this. You got along so well when you were little. - Now you're always fighting. - Give us a break, Mom. We're not fighting. Since that woman came into our house nothing's the same. What are we going to do about Mom? She doesn't even recognize us any more. It's better this way. Hello. How are you? You're staying here too? - Hi, Alexandra. - Hi, Johnny. - How are you? - Fine. - What about that T-shirt? - Next week. - Shall we go? - Yeah. Bye, Alexandra. This is for the phone bill. I think it's been disconnected. Goodnight. Goodnight. You always make the decisions. I make the decisions because I alone can make them. This time I'll talk to him. And tell him what? Haven't you said enough already? The truth! And where will that get you? You think it will change your relationship in any way? All you'll accomplish is to destroy ours. Our love is founded on a secret... and that is what makes it magnificent. Only the relationship. That's all you think about. Why do you say things you don't believe? - I am tired! - Tired of what? Of me? Of everything. Of this life. This is our life, Christos. You also have another life. Yes, I have another life... but my real life is this one. With you. You and I are the same. "LE MIRAGE" I have never been to Sounio. Me neither. I mean, it's as if I've never been. - Enjoy your stay. - Thanks. So... does it remind you of anything? Absolutely nothing. - It sucks here, right? - It's perfect! This is the house your Dad died in? That's what they say. D'you think we might see his ghost? Aris stop. It's not funny. D'you have any more photos? one, Kalliga never keeps anything. I have a couple of my Dad's from magazines. This is from a magazine too. If we could find that issue I'm sure there'd be more. Maybe. Do you think anything will change if you remember? Maybe. And if it does, will you still love me? Maybe. Maybe even more! - Lik e how much? - Lik e the ocean. That little? You're strong. But not that strong. - I'm very strong. - I can see that. - You're going in. - Don't. Aris, please stop. You're going in. Aris, please... stop. I can't swim! - Why didn't you tell me? - Because I was ashamed. My Dad was a seaman. He was in a shipwreck when I was six. He was missing for two weeks. Then a fisherman found his body caught in his nets. My mother identified him from their wedding ring. She went mad, never really recovered. ot even for us. She adored him. Later she developed a form of Alzheimer's and lost it completely. So, she never took us to the seaside again. So, I never learned to swim. either did my brother. Now do you understand? I'll teach you. Now! Not now. Now! Don't let go of me. Never. Aris! Why did you leave me? - I'm sorry, I got dizzy. - What happened? Are you OK? Let's get out of here. Always problems with this pool I see... Unsolvable, I'm afraid. I think I'll have to close it. But I'm keeping it for sentimental reasons. Your grandfather adored it. It was his achievement. But then again I hate the hassle. It will take so long... And it will deprive me of my favorite place in the world. My only refuge. Doesn't a refuge end up by becoming a prison? And isn't it hell being in love? Quite the opposite. The universe acquires meaning... Or becomes insignificant. - Is she pretty? - Very. - Smart, too, I guess... - Yes. - Her family? - What about her family? - Have you met them? - Not yet. Why should I care? - Don't be so sure... - What? - What's her name? - Alexandra. An irresistible name! I want to meet her. Can you take it? This one or this one? either. What's his name? - Aris. - What? I'll tell you tonight. OK? Tonight. Bye, Mom. Don't forget to feed the cows. - Time I should be going. - Too late. - I don't think it's a good idea. - Come on, don't be silly. She's not some monster. Well, maybe she is a little. C'mon! I'm kidding. You can handle it! I want you to see what you've rescued me from. ALEXADRA'S FIRST VISIT TO MRS KALLIGAS' We've been expecting you. You must be Alexandra. Aris has told me so much about you. Alexandra! I'm sorry. It's my fault. It's so pretty here. Look! - We need to go back. - Not yet, please. We must. Come on. But you fell in the pool! How is that possible? Poor darlings! Are you alright? Sylvia have them bring over some dry clothes. I would suggest that you take a shower, too! What an adventure! Well I must be off unfortunately. These eternal appointments! I leave you with Christos. Alexandra, it's been a real pleasure. I am sure we'll meet again. Get off. Don't do anything stupid. - Aris, I feel terrible, really. - o! o! Nikos! Who? Nikos, my brother. Who? What's going on Nikos? Are you nuts? What's the matter with you? What's going on, Niko? Get lost, you asshole. - How do you know my brother? - Tell her how you know me. I didn't know you were brother and sister... - Why, man? - Honest I didn't. - Why? - Take it easy. - You knew it. - Calm down! - You both did! - Relax. You're putting me on! Calm down. Aris, stop! Enough. I'm out of here. You take care. PART TWO Thank God there were no victims. And most important... the temple wasn't damaged. There'll be some restoration a little cleaning up. Nothing more. In less than a year everything will be like before, if not better. I'm handling it personally. I was there that night at Sounio, I remember. I remember them yelling, him pushing her. - What happened? - I don't know anything. - She killed him! - Stop it! Are you mad? What are you saying? You think your mother killed him? Yes. You've gone too far. You know that? Why did you hide it from me? Your mother wanted to protect you. - From what? - The press. - The press? - They were all over you. Bullshit! I'm fed up. Your mother loves you, Aris. We all love you. KALLIGA FAMILY: A GREEK TRAGED Y Are you drinking it or not? Since when is a glass of champagne a crime? Besides, now is the perfect time for it. Everything happened exactly as I told you. The only thing I hid from you was that you were there too... You were so little, what good would it have done? What if I wok e up? What if I saw something? What if, what if... You were asleep, Aris! Asleep! The first thing I did was to rush to your room and you're asleep! You know what your problem is? You stick to the past... to things that don't matter, instead of pushing forward. When you were little, you drew so amazingly. You could have been a successful artist, a business tycoon, anything. You're young, good-looking, rich! Move on! Have fun! Spend! Live! - Joy Martinocosta just arrived. - Who? I forgot to tell you. She was passing through Athens... and I ask ed her over for a drink. We haven't seen her for so long. Sometimes I feel like strangling you! Not now, dear. It's been ages! Must be some new fad. - Nothing ever changes. - Some things do. I've missed you so... There's a fish in there? - Is that possible? - What? We'll have such a great time when we're married? - What could change? - We'll have a big family. - We're never bored together. - Never. - What time is it? - I don't know. Too early, too late... Hungry? Should we eat? - Sleep? - Not yet. I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Punish me. - Please stop. - Punish me. Because you stood me up, or because you are coked out? - That's the last time, I swear. - I don't believe you. Look at me! - Let's get out of here. - And go where? The U.S., France, wherever you want. - We can catch the first flight. - Just lik e that? What's to stop us? Nikos is gone. We'll get someone to look after your mother... And you? There is nothing holding you back? Nothing. Just you. We can live in New York... or in the countryside, I know the perfect place. If you don't like the States, we can go to London, Paris, Barcelona. We can travel around, until we get bored. Stop! We'll have a new life together far away. - We can get married. - Aris stop. - You want to get married? - Stop it! Tell me. I don't know... When we're not together, I get scared... I fall apart. Hello, Alexandra. KALLIGA'S FIRST AD LAST VISIT TO ALEXADRA'S HOUSE Sorry for coming unannounced, but I had to talk to you. Come in. How do you do? Kalliga. - Has something happened? - Yes. Last night they brought Aris home in a terrible state. Is he all right? Not to worry, nothing serious. In the past, ambulances were his main means of transport. I'm joking, of course. Aris has a serious problem and I don't mean drugs. Perhaps you know it, if he hasn't already told you. Aris has had a serious psychological, or, rather... psycho-neurological problem... since childhood. He isn't getting any better. For some time now he's been getting treatment... which unfortunately he stopped when he met you. He must return to the clinic at once. Your relationship mak es him dream he can mak e it on his own. But things are getting worse. You must have realized that. I know you love each other and want to get married... but believe me that would be disastrous. Your're asking me to break up? Of course not. He just needs to be on his own. For a few months, a year, perhaps. A year you also need. How do you know what I need? You're young, beautiful, strong... You've got talent and lots of ambition. You're different. Your feet are planted on the ground. You can make it. Isn't it pity to waste it all in pursuit of a fantasy? You've never done it? Let me help you. I know it's hard but it's the only way. Go away for a while, continue your studies in Paris. I will provide you with a very comfortable life. So you can devote yourself to your art without distractions. I will introduce you to powerful people who will help you. You will get ahead. You will acquire everything you need... so you can really help Aris. You understand what I'm saying. I think I do. As for your mother, she can go to one of the best clinics. I'll take care of it personally. She'll have a very comfortable life, I promise you. And then? Then if all goes well, Aris will have completed his therapy... You'll have reached your goals. You can make a new start together. My future with Aris is something I'll decide with him. If only Aris was capable of making his own decisions... Alexandra, I'm afraid! I'm his mother! I love Aris! I know. And I want this love to survive. I hope you make the right decision for the two of you. You can be certain of that. Anything else? o. I have to go. Give me a call. As soon as possible. Good bye. A pleasure... AT "THE OCEAN" - I said to go somewhere quiet. - This is very quiet. You'll see. I am going to the john. I'll be right back. Everything OK? I found the magazine you were looking for. What magazine? The one with the photo of your house at Sounio. Oh! Where did you find it? The school library. "A Greek Tragedy" Enough with tragedies. Now I'm starting a new life with you. To our new life. "When I drink I become a different person. " That's what you said to me. Remember? To that different person then, who adores you. - What are we celebrating? - Joy! This is Alexandra. Yesterday you stood me up! All afternoon. ever make a date with Aris. He'll never turn up. But then again that's his charm. o? Joy and I grew up together. You can imagine how hellish that was! I love your hair! I'm going to the toilet. Coming? What were we saying? Nothing. It's not important. That looks fantastic! I'll go wash up. - What did I do? - You know damn well. - But I didn't do anything. - Please. Keep out of it. - OK so kill me! - Your nose is bleeding. FOR A BETTER FUTURE Where are you going? You're leaving? You! You again! - Me what? - This is all your doing. - What have I done this time? - You want to be in control. - Nonsense. - What did you tell her? - Let go of my arm. How dare you? - Out with it! I helped a situation that was already out of control. Let me be the judge of that. It's my life. You see your life next to this girl? Will you, Aris Kalligas, live a married life? You wouldn't last a month. It looks wonderful because you know it can never happen. Shut up! Any possibility of the contrary would kill off all your desire. Shut up! You're already bored and you're acting spasmodically. You're always telling me what I am and what I feel. What do you know about me? And you think you know? You think you'll find out this way? Taking a dead end to destruction? You're hurting me! Where is she going? Tell me! We are not like other people. - We're different and you know it. - Bullshit! Where is she going? You want to destroy her too? Come on Aris, give her a chance. Let her live. Where is she going? Paris. There, now, run. The Air France afternoon flight. Good morning. Your tick et please. Luggage? PART THREE You startled me! What's the matter, Christos? Have you been drinking? - I'm sorry. - For whom? Yourself? Both of us. Game over. Oh God, what a scene! And we lost. Stop laughing. Don't you get it? Sure. You're drunk and getting melodramatic again. And, as usual, you blame me. Don't talk to me about lost lives. I gave you everything! What did you do? I couldn't do anything. You could, but you didn't want to. You lived a life with no responsibility. You had everything you wanted. A huge fortune. An easy life. Your garden. Me. It was all a lie. Yes but in this lie you lived the way you wanted. You'd rather have a truth that would destroy us in seconds? What would we do? Get married? Announce that Aris is your son? It was a mutual decision. And you got the best part. I was deprived of my son. So was I. No family is ideal. I loved you more than any other man and you know it. But now, please... stop. You can't love anyone for real. For real? either can you. I'm leaving. Is that a threat? Go then. Who is stopping you? No one ever stopped you. You're going where, to do what? Who's waiting for you out there? I'm to blame. There is something you should know. Christos was your father. What are you saying? He was the son of my nanny, three years younger than I. We grew up together. And fell in love. We were just kids. He was so handsome. When I got pregnant everything changed. I decided to k eep the baby and start my own life... ...away from my father. I was 20, and Christos under age. And of course he was always the deaf son of a servant. I foolishly married someone else... thinking I could simply divorce afterwards lik e everyone else. I was so wrong. That man was my nemesis. You should be happ y he wasn't your real father. Why did you never tell me? Because we got used to this lie. Now what? He loved you so much. What do you expect me to do now? I don't know... What kind of person are you? So then that was the truth? The truth, Sylvia? The truth is I'll miss him terribly. IN DEEP WATER - What time will you be back? - Not too late. You have a family? Everybody does Ms Martinocosta. It's true. I have some cousins I never see. The rest are dead. Everybody dies on me. Not too tight. How do I look? Truly? Very beautiful. As always. What's he doing? He should be here. - Will you still need me? - o. You may go. Aris will be here any minute. Have fun! Enough for today. Sylvia, why do you stay here? With me? It's a very good job! With an excellent salary, too! Help me take it off! Please. I can't! I can't! Where were you? Why weren't you here? I'm sorry. - Baby put that down. - Leave me alone! Calm down. Let me go! What are you doing? Don't go! A FIRST ENDING The nights have started growing longer. Which season do you prefer, winter or summer? In this city it's the summers that count. My darling Christos, so sentimental. He never threw away a single thing. I wok e up in the middle of the night when I heard shouting. I saw you fighting at the edge of the staircase. Yes. I'd been trying to get a divorce a long time. He k ept refusing. That day without my knowing it... he had seen us with Christos. When I got back that night he was drunk in the bedroom. He'd tied up Christos nak ed on the bed and was torturing him... humiliating him. As soon as he saw me, he attack ed me. He hit me and threatened to say everything to the press. I didn't care any more. I got away from him and started to run... He caught me at the staircase. I got between you. You tried to stop him. You pleaded with him. He hit you too. It drove me mad. He grabbed you by the neck and tried to strangle you. He would have if you hadn't... I pushed him with all my might. My necklace brok e in his hands. He took you with him as he fell. - I killed him. - No, Aris. You saved me. Aris! Aris! - Why did you tak e off lik e that? - I'm sorry. - This is a family meeting. - But I'm family too. Indeed. Go on... He died instantly. You just suffered a minor concussion. Fortunately our doctor was in Hydra. The same night he took you to Switzerland. You spent some time in bed. When recovered thank God, you remembered nothing. I sent you to boarding school in England and left. I couldn't face the reporters. Father took care of everything. - I was away for years. - And Christos? He waited for me. I returned when my father died and we took up residence here. You know the rest. Our life was a well k ept secret. - I knew. Dad had told me. - Knew what? That they were brother and sister. The maid's son and your mom. What? The gardener who killed himself was the illegitimate son... of your grandfather and the maid. Dad often spok e about it. Mom? Yes. We were half brother and sister. What are you talking about? It made our relationship stronger. And a reason to k eep it secret. You know what people are lik e... What kind of a life was that? Anything else I should know? No. - Let's go, my love. - Please. I'm dead beat. Where are you going? Far away from here. Home. Good bye, mother. - Aris, you know I love you. - Yes. But so do I. It's dawning. You should get some sleep. So much for the truth! NIKOS DELLIS in the new TV series SACRIFICES Mrs Kalliga is donating her house to charity... and leaving Athens for ever with a ball to honor the unveiling... of the new Akropolis. How's that? Hold me. You'll come with me, won't you? How strange! I'm leaving this place and I feel practically nothing. I might even say I'm happy. Aris, it's been so long. I was afraid you wouldn't come. - What time is the show? - Right now. Thank you. - You look well. - So do you. - Happy? - Should I be? - Of course. You deserve it. - For what reason? For many. Primarily because you're my son. ALEXANDRA'S SECOND AD LAST VISIT AT KALLIGA'S Alexandra, I am glad you could make it. Thank you for inviting me. I always keep my promises. You're the talk of Paris! Of course, I knew it all along. You seem to know things about people... they don't know about themselves. Joy, let me introduce you to an old friend of Aris, Alexandra. We've met. A long time ago. - You've changed your hair, right? - Yes. It's nice! You've seen Aris? - Not yet. - You must. Where is he though? Aris! It's Alexandra! I'll be right back. - When did you get back? - Yesterday. You're staying? I am leaving tomorrow. I came to see my mother. - How is she? - She's much better. I am glad. Nikos? I know. He's become an actor. He's starting in a serial. He's fine. - You've changed a lot. - I know. - Are you happy? - Are you? - What do you think? - You look well. Why did you go? I think you know why. You could have spok en to me first. I tried to. Remember? At any rate you got on very well with my mother. All I needed was a little time but you ran away. So did you! Alexandra, you've met Francois? I didn't expect to meet you in this lifetime. Thanks a lot Mom. I will never forget this evening. Isn't that the point to any party? I thought you'd decided to have a real life. That's what I'm doing darling and I assure you it's no easy matter. I am going to find Joy. Marvellous! Like a fairy tale! Don't you want to go home? No, I want to see the show. It will be one of a kind. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Joy, where are you? Come on! I'm going. I love you. I'll see you later. Where are you going? I've got to go. Again? - Why did you come? - I wanted to see you. And? - I shouldn't have. - Please stay. Tell me nothing has changed. Everything's changed. Can't you see that? Tell me you still love me. I still love you. Take me with you. Where? Somewhere we don't know. Is there such a place? One more chance. It's always beautiful here. - Will you forgive me? - Will you? Of course. - Come with me. - Where? Come. We don't need to do anything any more. Just swim. for Herbert 1958- 1984
