let's hear it again for our wonderful band! I am so thrilled to announce, thanks to your generosity, we have reached our goal for the military families christmas fund for another year! as you all know... Tyler, we have one more song. Do you mind having teddy step in for me please? -Yeah. -Yeah. Thanks. For those who sacrificed so much. what're you doing out there? The storm's really picking up. Since you're here... Try this. I've been working on it all week. I think I've finally had a breakthrough. Mmm. It's really good. It needs more nutmeg. I liked it. Well, I need you to love it. Okay, I have a few more gingerbread elves to prep and then I should be ready to go in about 15 minutes. Okay. Ah. I didn't realize how late it was. My... My mom's been here since 4:00am and I told her I'd finish up. I am so sorry, tyler. Don't be. Shouldn't you be with the band? I promised you a dance. Here? Why not? I'm covered in flour. now we both are. merry christmas, kat. I wish this moment could last forever. Forever sounds pretty good to me. okay, will, only two more blocks. Only? Do you need to take a break? No way. You got it? Yes. Awesome. Okay. Yeah, look at that. What do you think? It's crooked. Yeah. But maybe we could, like, add ornaments to that side, you know to... Weigh it out. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. All right. You wanna get more from the closet? Yep. hi, mom. Got your message. We've just been so busy here. Did I tell you we agreed to cater the snowball? No. Wow, do you have enough staff for that? Well, your sister's flying in on Wednesday and I was hoping I could count on you to throw on an apron for old time's sake. Mom, I decided that will and I are gonna spend christmas here in boston. When did you decide that? I've been considering it for a while and I got some time off from the bank and I made all these plans for will and I this week. Well, it won't be the same without you both. Well, maybe you could come up here for new year's. We have a guest bedroom with your name on it. Katherine, it's been two years since tyler's funeral. It's time to come home, hun. Next year. I promise. We're not going to grandma's? Uh, well, you know sweetie, I've thought about it and I thought you and I could have so much fun, just the two of us here in the city. But we didn't go last year. Right, but... I have so many activities planned. I mean, come on. What? Twenty-five reasons we're gonna have the best christmas ever? Can I just go back to my room? You don't wanna help me finish decorating the tree? Uh, no thanks. I'm tired. Well, we did carry a christmas tree three blocks. Four. Right. Yeah, of course you can. I'll... I'll finish up. Thanks. hello? Hi, mom. Do you have room for two more? I'm coming home. oh, oh. That... No, that... That's not... I'm so sorry. I thought... I should... I should probably cut down on the caffeine, anyway. the 11:15 departure is now boarding at... Okay, let's go. I believe this is our seat. Great. You want the window or the- answered that question. Thank you. I really appreciate that. You're welcome. Ah, if it isn't my mystery patron. No, don't. It's okay. I should find my seat. Right. Excuse me. Looks like this is me. Did you draw that? It's nothing, it's just a quick sketch. Don't sell yourself short. That is really good. Thanks. Hey, welcome aboard our holiday express, you guys. Can I interest you in one of our signature holiday cookies? Yeah, we'll take two. Thank you. Make that three. -Wait? -What? Oh, you don't have to do that. Don't worry about it. It's on you. thank you. That's for you. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you so much. That can't be right. It is. Are you sure? I am sure, I promise. Mom, jack doesn't believe me that it's ten pipers piping. Jack? He thinks it's ten drummers drumming. Right. It's ten lords a leaping. Ah... We're both wrong? You know that, though. Right? I have been singing that in public for days. you put the eight on the nine, and then flip this one... Mm-hmm. Oh, and then there's another- -yeah. -Yeah. Thank you. Flips. You a musician? Professionally, no. I picked that thing up a couple years ago. I was going through something a bit... Rough. I had heard music was good for the soul, saw it in a store window, haven't put it down since. Did it help? It did. And I think my neighbours really appreciate the fact that I didn't pick the drum set. that's true. Okay. Hmm. So where are you headed? Uh, we're going home for christmas. We're gonna spend time with my family. He's really excited about it. Are you? It's complicated. But not so complicated that I wanna pour my heart out to a stranger on the train. Why not? Those are the best people to pour your heart out to. No baggage, no judgement, you never have to see me again. Ha. I suppose that's true, but I'll stick to solitaire. Fair enough. What about you? Where are you headed? Uh... Going to see an old friend. Uh, I just realized that I don't know your name. It's katherine. But my friends call me kat. Pleased to meet you, katherine. Well, I just- I can't assume we're friends until after our second partners solitaire game. fair enough. I'm so sorry. You should have woken me up. I didn't mean to use you as a pillow. I'm sorry. You looked peaceful. Thank you. And it gave me a chance to steal your book. It's a great edition. Yeah. It was a gift. You're welcome to read it. Mom. Hmm? We have to leave. What? We have to leave. Oh. He already left. Let's go. Watch your step. There they are! Oh, haven't you grown! Hi, dad. Hello, kat. Oh, honey. Mom, hi. Hi, mom. How are you? I'm well. Where's jess? She's minding the store. Let me take something. Oh, thanks, dad. How was your trip? Tell me all about it. Alright. So, first we went on the train... Yes, very good trip. Thanks for coming to get us. You bet. I'm glad you came. I really appreciate it. Katherine, you've got your old room. Will, let me show you where you're gonna be staying. All right. mom, where are my gloves? oh, I'm sorry. That's okay. Dad... I'll take care of that. Go get settled in. Sandy. Hi, beth. How are you? I'm good. Are you still taking christmas pre-orders? Oh, I'm sorry. We closed the list on Monday. Shoot. We're hosting this year and paul's side of the family has been dreaming of your christmas croissants since thanksgiving. How about a half dozen? Oh. You're a saint. Your mother's an absolute saint. I know. Thank you. Bye bye. Mom. You're doing the snowball and you're still taking single orders? Of course. We're part of too many family traditions, honey. kat? Hi. I thought that was you. I didn't know you were in town. Last minute decision. How are you? Getting better. If you need anything, anything at all, you know I'm just a phone call away. Thank you. What's all that? Ah, I promised your mother I would bring by the menu and allergy lists for the snowball. I'm in charge this year. We're going all out. I even managed to get the band back together. I mean, it took some convincing but I talked roger into it. So it's just you and roger? Wouldn't be much of a trio. Right. Of course. Thankfully I was able to find a replacement, although no one could ever replace tyler. So is teddy filling in? No, he was deployed over the summer. He won't be back until the new year. I'm sorry. Yeah. Helps to stay busy. Do you have any plans tonight? No. You do now. Everyone's home for the holiday, we're all going to danson's at 8:00, you should come. Oh, I um... Hi! And just in time. This yule log is starting to look like a yule stump. Hi! Hi. I missed you so much. I missed you, too. I'm glad mom finally got you to come home for christmas. What changed your mind? Will. How is he? Doing well. I mean, he doesn't really open up to me anymore. I feel like I'm always walking on eggshells around him. It's gonna take some time. Christmas is hard 'cause tyler always made it so special for him, you know. I know. Well, we're all here to help. You don't have to do it alone. I know provincetown holds a lot of memories for you but I think it could be good for him. It could be good for you, too. How was the train ride? Long. We hung a stocking for you. I appreciate it. Unless you're gonna fill it with coal. I should. Serves you right for spending christmas in another time zone. Well, I promise I'll make it back for new year's. It's not gonna be the same and you know it. We're gonna miss you, jay. I'm gonna miss you, too, but this is something I need to do. I know it is, but if you don't find hi- I'm going to. I put it off for too long, nora. I can't wait any longer. Well, I'll expect updates. You'll get them. You made it! Yeah, of course. Kat, I'd like you to meet... Jack. You know each other? -No. -Yes. I mean, we met on the train. Jack is the guitarist I was telling you about. He's the one filling in with the band. Small world. So how long have you two known each other? A couple hours. Give or take. What? I posted a message on the va's online community board looking for a guitarist. Jack answered. He works for the uso. You know, I'm gonna go check on our food. Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world she has- stop it. Provincetown is hardly casablanca. And technically speaking, you walked into mine. Right. So, uso? I enlisted right out of high school, but then got injured a few years back so it was another way to serve my country, just different. You were in the service. Army. Two tours. You look surprised. How is your friend? Didn't you say you were meeting someone in town? Right. No, I haven't seen him yet. Why not? There she is. Roger! Wow. Kat. Oh! Look at you. I hardly recognized you. Good to see you! Nice. You know, the regulation. Uh, jack, this is roger. Roger, jack. Hey. You must be the guitarist. Yes. Welcome aboard. Thank you. Roger is the drummer in the band. And he's provincetown's finest. I wanna hear all about boston. Do you need a ride? No, I'm staying at an inn here off the main road, uh, bleaker I think? Oh yeah. It's just down the stop sign and you make a right. Thanks. Mm-hmm. I'll see you tomorrow? Something on your mind? I just wonder what would make someone want to spend christmas with strangers. It's the season of giving, kat. Maybe he just doesn't have anywhere else to go. Hey. So I have a favour to ask. Maggie put me on the decorating committee for the dance and I thought maybe you could help me. My help? Well, I don't have your artistic eye. Besides, I thought it'd be fun. I thought it was something we could do together. It'll be fun. I promise. I knew I could count on you. This speaker should go to the left of the stage. Hey, maggie. Hey, kat, will, so happy you're here! Oh yeah, we are ready to work. Follow me. These will be our stage decorations. Most have already been cut they just need a coat of paint. Uh, the brushes are right here. There are smocks if you need them and extra tarps over there. So I'll leave you to it. -Great. -Yeah. Just let me know if you need anything else. There's only green and white. Yeah, right. When I asked you to help with this I kinda thought it was gonna require a little more creativity but don't worry. Don't panic. I have an idea. I can fix this. I know where the supply closet is. I bet they have tons more colours back there. All right. Stay right there. I'll fix this. All right. Hi, jack. Hi. Uh, are these service men and women from town? Yeah. You have a lot of them. Well, there's a base about 20 minutes away. A lot of generations of military families have set root here. But that's not all of them, right? I mean, if every person who earned a patch on their arm was up here on this wall we would need a much bigger wall. That's my dad. Wow. Are you looking for someone? No, just... Caught my eye. Okay. I better get back to work. Mm-hmm. Hey, does the library still do the snowman contest? I think so. I'm not sure. I think it was last week. Hey, I saw that. You're gonna ruin your dinner. mmm. If you're looking for something to do, the rink has holiday open skate every afternoon until christmas eve. Oh, that's awesome. I found the second box of lights. I'm gonna put them up. I thought you were done with the roof. Well, now I have enough for the garage. Hey! For the road. You know, this is half a page. This is plenty of fun stuff for will and I to do. I'm gonna go ask him. He's not in his room. Where is he? Hey, will! Think you need these? Whatcha working on? A fort. We always build one after first snow. You need some help? Uh, no. I can do it. Okay. Well, don't take too long 'cause dinner's almost ready. I won't. I always forget that one. it's a new song. We'll get there. Uh, you know, I'm gonna go get the lyrics. I'll be right back. So maggie said your band used to always play this show? Tyler's idea. He found out they were paying a band to perform, thought that money should be put right back into the charity. Sounds like he was a good guy. Tyler... He was the best. Maggie said he passed. Car accident. Kat was at home with will when it happened. It absolutely devastated her. Katherine? Well, he was her husband. They didn't tell you? I got it. Okay, let's try again. We're good? Yeah? nana is going to be so excited to see you! And bring a hat in case you wanna play outside. Hello, hello! Oh, hi! Oh, it's so nice to see you both. -Merry christmas. -Merry christmas. Merry christmas, honey. Brought you gingerbread cookies. He insisted. Well, mom was gonna bring fruitcake instead. Oh, come on in. I've got some tea on. Oh, nice. Oh, careful. I suppose I should get a new stocking for will. He's growing up so fast. Yeah, I keep telling him to stop it but he doesn't listen. No, they never do. It's just so nice to see him smiling again. It's the highlight of my days. So I heard that you're gonna be working at the bakery while you're here. Oh, yeah. I'm happy to help out, wherever they need. They're certainly lucky to have you. You've got such a gift. Tyler used to say that his favourite place to be was the bakery. Well, that's because he would steal cookie dough when I wasn't looking. Yes, and you were always full of pure joy. Still our best-sellers, though I never could get them quite as good as yours. You're gonna have to tell me your secret at some point, honey. I'm not sure I even remember. It's been a long time. Well, it's kinda like riding a bicycle. I haven't done that in a long time, either. well, I'm sure once you get started it'll all come rushing back. So the first day the ice froze your dad, he'd be on that pond. He loved it. Yeah, and your mom would be right beside him with a big thermos of hot chocolate just waiting for him. Why, she can- she can tell you some stories. She doesn't really like talking about him. Well, sometimes very happy memories can be sad, too. right? Would you like to hear another story? Yeah. Okay. So one christmas morning, your dad, it was really early in the morning came down those stairs and wanted to have a sneak peek... I told maggie that I would go with her to mckinley's to pick out some trees. Well, give her my love. I will. Where's maggie? She got held up at the hall. So she sent you? I volunteered. And I'm the only one who can drive stick. good enough for me. All right. Did maggie say how many she wanted? No. Whatever will fit in the truck. Sounds good to me. Christmas at the barn? Oh, they do it every year. They put up a tarp and they project old christmas movies. They're playing "beyond tomorrow"? Oh, really? Hey do you want some hot- my grandmother's favourite. Are you two close? She raised me. Both my parents passed when I was young and... And I always miss them but my grandmother knew around christmas time I always missed them a little more so she'd take us out of town to this old rialto, here you go, and watch all the classics. Thank you. Hey... Did it help? I think it always helps to fill sad memories with happier ones. You okay? My husband passed away two years ago. I'm sorry. Thank you. He was a music teacher on his way to a recital and the other driver ran the stop sign. I just worry about will, you know? I worry that... That I'm not doing enough to help him get through this. I know I haven't known you two for very long... But? But have you ever considered that maybe he's worrying the same thing about you? Oh, timber! Got it? Okay. Hang on. Okay, wait, I'll get this end. Ready, one, two, three. Uh, yeah. Right over here by this table. -Yep. -Here? Just right here. Thank you. Yep. Good job. Thank you. don't step on me. Thank you. Yeah. Hey, will. How's it going? Hi. Will is putting his old grandpa to shame. Look at that. Looking good, man. Oh, dad, I want you to meet jack. He's helping out with the band. Um, jack, this is my dad, john winter. Pleasure to meet you, sir. Likewise. So are you almost done? Mom wants us back in time to help with the close. Uh, 4:30. All right. Hey, you wanna get washed up? That is a real nice watch. Oh, thanks. It was made special for the provincetown bicentennial. They gave it to all the volunteers that year. There's only 30 of those in existence. Wow, it's- mom, can I get a get a gingerbread cookie when we get there? Really nice. It's almost time for dinner. Grandpa said I could. Uh, just a small one. Well, we'll talk about it. We'll get going. See you at home? -Yeah. -All right. -Bye, jack. -Bye. I'll be right along. Good to meet you. Likewise. hello, hello. Hi. I was hoping you could help me. Of course. Do you know where I could find copies of the local paper? Absolutely. We have the last 50 years archived. Follow me. It's right this way. Maybe try one of these ones? Oh, that should be great. Thank you. Perfect. bad day? I just have to stretch them out a bit. I'll be fine. Aww. I'd give you these old hands if I could. I know you would. It's time, sweetheart. You can't put it off forever. I know. But... I'm gonna be sad to see it go, you know? I know. All good things come to an end. but not today. Okay. Mmm. well, that's all I can recall off the top of my head. This is great. Yeah, I can try and dig up the paperwork but it's been a long time. Bicentennial was nearly 20 years ago. I really appreciate it. Are any of these men still in town? Most of them. Thank you for your help. Why do you need these? Hey! Will, you look great! It's a christmas gift. Oh. Jack! Are you here to skate? Hi. Hi. Uh, no, I was... I was just meeting someone. Well, you should. No, uh, you shouldn't feel like you have to say yes just because he... Asked. I got time. oh, he's a natural. He doesn't get it from me. Okay, well, let's see. Size six? I took a guess. I don't skate. Mm-hmm. It's a good thing I'm a good teacher. Come on. What? No. I- come on. I don't think this is a good idea. That's great. I think I'm getting the hang of it. I think so, too. Nice. -Woah. -Woah! I'm not- I'm not laughing at you. You're not laughing with me. It's just you are- you're so well put together that it's nice to find a flaw. Oh, well I'm happy to help. Yeah. Oh, are you okay? Yeah. No, it's just- what? What is it? It's an old injury. Are you in pain? No. You are squeezing my arm kinda tight. Oh, I'm sorry. I... you okay? -Yeah. -Yeah? I'm okay. Wait, I'm sorry. Maybe I should just... No. Let's keep going. I have another idea. Okay. Try this. Ready? Yeah. All you have to do is nothing. that's perfect. Okay? Will, look! I'm skating! Sort of. He's skating. He's pulling me. let's get that kid! Get him! Get him! Get him! yeah! Thank you. Oh, I got it. No. We asked you. Exactly. And this is my thank you. Thank you very much. Mike's not here right now. Do you have a number where I could reach him? I'm not supposed to give that out but if you leave your information I can let him know. Okay. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Uh... Actually, maybe there is. What do you think of this? It's not exactly my style. For teddy. Oh, have you talked to him lately? Last night. He's really excited about the band. I told him I'd send him a video of the performance. That's a good idea. How's it going? How is, uh, jack doing? He's great. He's very talented. Is he bringing someone to the show? No. And he'd have to go through me for tickets. Why? No reason. I think he's single, if that's what you're asking. Well, I'm not asking, and I don't think that he is. I saw a photo of a woman in his wallet. Okay. I just think it's strange. If he has someone special to him what's he doing spending christmas here? With us? Hey! What's all this? Oh... I'm almost finished. Do you like it? You did this? Uh-huh. Why? For will. Me? Yeah. We have been wasting our talents on these cut-out trees. I thought you could paint a mural for the dance. Of what? Anything you want. I already ran it by maggie, she thinks it's a great idea. So get to work. hey, um, thank you so much for doing this. It was nothing. No, it's not. Good news? It's my sister. My nephew found her christmas wrapping stash. Wait, but... That's your sister? Mm-hmm. She's hosting christmas for the first time in her new home. She's very excited. Grandma's flying in from texas and she's keeping me up to date with all these little moments. Mom, can jack come over for dinner? Do you like lasagna? So you met jack through maggie? -He's playing with the band. -Oh. That's not what I heard. Will told me you guys met on the train over here. Really? We were sitting next to each other. Oh. It's kind of funny. It's almost like, I don't know, fate keeps bringing the two of you together. It's not fate, okay? It's not. It's just- it's just a coincidence. Okay. All right. Yeah, we need some reinforcements here for sure. Reinforcements, yeah. And then this right over here... Oh! I am very sorry. That slipped. Yeah. Sorry, it slipped. ouch, ouch! Oh! Oh! there's your mom. Fifteen more minutes. We're almost done. That should be fine. If you wanna help it might only take ten minutes. Is your mom any good with a shovel? You can use mine. Sure. But the snowball fighting is over, right? -I mean... -Oh, yeah. We're all safe? Truce? For now. For sure. Woah! I didn't do anything to you! All right. Ready? Mm-hmm. whew! Wow. Nice. Look what I found. Remember these from when you were a kid? I do remember these. You brought the fireworks. One for you... Will's favourite lasagne. Can I have two? Yes, of course. -If you don't mind sharing. -Sure. Thank you. Cheers. Well, cheers everyone. Of course. Cheers, dad. Oh yeah, cheers. All right, who would like mchenry's hot cocoa? Oh! Yes! Well, let's grab our coats. That's the best. Who doesn't? Jack? Sure, I'd love to. I'll get your coat. Hello? Hi, is this jack sutherland? Yes. This is mike conlin from conlin hardware. Oh. Uh, thank you. Thanks for calling me back. You um, you volunteered at the provincetown bicentennial? I did, yeah. Years ago. Uh, are you around this week? There's something I would like to talk to you about. Well, I'm closing up in twenty. If you can make it before that I'd be happy to chat. Any way we can do it tomorrow? I'm spending christmas upstate. Heading out tonight. Mr. Sutherland? Yes, I will be there in five minutes. Thanks. Okay. Here's your stuff. Thanks. Ready? Thank you for dinner but I- I have to go. Something just came up. Is everything okay? Yeah, just bad timing. Oh. Mr. Conlin. Mr. Sutherland. Just made it. Sorry, I took a wrong turn. I'm not from around here. You got a question for me? whatcha watching? Nothing. Where'd you find that? Nana had a whole box of them. Why didn't you tell me about it? You know, you don't ever have to hide what you're feeling from me. It's okay to miss him. I miss him, too. You know, your dad loved making the set list for the dance. He would sit with me in the bakery and play dozens of christmas albums while I was making cookies. After my shift I would be humming those songs for hours. Christmas was his favourite day of the year. Until the day you were born. And then he had two favourites. Sometimes it hurts to remember the past, but those memories are gifts. The years of laughter and love and joy... You know your dad is always with us. He's right here. We're in this together, okay? Okay. Now press play. sounds beautiful. I didn't mean to interrupt. Sorry. Ah, it's hard to learn a whole set list in a week so I'm just sneaking in an extra practise. What is that? It's like a... Closest thing I could get to a chocolate croissant. What, do you want half? Absolutely not. Normally I don't really have much of a sweet tooth but my grandma used to make chocolate croissants at christmas so it reminds me of home, so I tried to- oh, I cannot let you eat this. I know it's not, like, the healthiest thing that... Bring the guitar. Let's go. Yeah, yeah, come on, jack. Let's go. Uh, it's closed. Don't worry. I happen to know the owners. So we're gonna make croissants? Not just any croissants. We are making the winter family christmas croissant. What makes them christmas? That is a family secret. Oh, right. Peppermint? Okay, well it's not exactly a well-guarded secret. You're good at this. I grew up coming here. I used to dream that I'd own it someday. So what happened? Tyler got a job in boston. It just wasn't meant to be. You obviously love it. I do. But I loved him more. Okay, so just to show you how here. You start with a triangle. Okay. Right. You just want it to roll... Okay. Like that. And then you pinch the ends. Got it. How's this? Um... No? It's- no, it's good- it's good for your first try. I mean... Thank you. Thank you for sparing my feelings. No, really. Get that on there. Perfect. Let's just try one more time. Thank you. Okay, so yeah, you do that. No, softer. Yeah. And you just roll straight... Right, you're doing great. So why are you here? Am I making that much of a mess already? That's not what I meant. You have a sister, you have family... Why aren't you spending the holidays with them? I told you. I'm meeting a friend. You believe in fate? I don't know. When I was growing up my grandmother would always tell my sister nora and I what is meant to be will always find a way. But it makes it sound like you don't have a choice. No, I think it's like our choices mean something. Nothing is random. Someone gave me a gift a long time ago. Mm-hmm? A second chance. At what? Life. Your injury. And I want to repay it. moment of truth. Wow. Okay. Oh, careful. It's hot. Well? Honestly? Best I've ever had. Just don't tell my grandmother I said that. I would never. Oh, my. Thank you for ruining croissants for me forever. Any time. You... You were made for this. I mean it. Maybe. Once upon a time. Thank you. I like to think we're given second chances for a reason. Hmm. Mistletoe? I have no idea what that's doing there. Yeah. I thought you were volunteering at the function hall today. I am. I just wanted to try something. I haven't seen this in a while. Yeah, I found it. I'd say you found more than just that. hey. Hi. Um, I thought about what you said last night and uh, you're right. Old dreams don't have to just stay in the past. You made these? Mm. Yeah. And, well, I wanted you to be the first one to try them. Well... I haven't seen him this happy in a long time. Do you have plans tonight? The secret's out, maggie found out I'm into old christmas movies so she gave me two tickets to the show at the farm. Would you like to go? He asked you to the movies! He likes the movies. Okay. He likes you. I'm not ready to be in a relationship, jess. You know it'd be okay if you were. Who's mom talking to? Oh, I... I can't remember their names but dad says they've been in almost every other week. They must really like the fruitcake. They wanna buy the bakery. The bakery has been in our family for five generations. It's part of so many traditions in this town, you said so yourself. I did? Jess said they wanna turn it into a gastropub? Well, it's a very attractive location right in the heart of town. I've had several offers over the years. So now it's on the table? Believe me, katherine, I'd rather not have to part with the bakery, it's just... I don't have a choice at this point. Mom, is this... Is this a money issue? No, nothing like that. But the hours are long and it's... It's very physical work. And I'm afraid I'm just not up to it anymore. Since you're back here why don't you go ice those cookies? Did you give them an answer? Not yet. You know, I always thought you'd- you'd take over for me when the time came. If I recall, for a while there that was the plan. Well, things don't always work out the way we plan. Well, they still could. I can't work here. Why not? Well, first of all, the commute. You could move back. And what? Quit my job? When you first applied at the bank it was supposed to be temporary, remember? Maybe it's not my dream job, but it's reliable. You know, the sandersons have their home for sale on oak... Okay, mom, listen. This just isn't my home anymore. Oh, my dear girl. This will always be your home. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you. All right, this is your movie. Where do you wanna sit? Oh, no, really. Up to you. I normally sit on the left. Okay, let's do it. Okay. Mm-hmm. Sounds good. You have a normal seat in movie theatres? Absolutely. -Good to know. -Mm-hmm. That's a really... I'm sorry. No, go ahead. Thank you. This is my favourite part. Merry christmas! Merry christmas! Merry christmas, everybody!... ...Come on, enjoy the drive. it was good, right? Really good, yes. A classic. I... I loved it. Um, you can turn that back in there if you want. Okay. I'll just be a second, okay? Thank you. What is this? Oh, um, it's a list of all the service members that are gonna be away at christmas. They have these booths all over town, you can write 'em a note, send it to 'em. Where's maggie's husband? He's right there. I thought teddy was short for theodore. Nope. It's edward. It's a family name. What does he do? He's a medic. Here. What's this? It's a pin. Oh. Of provincetown. So you can remember us. Somehow I think I'll have a hard time forgetting. Hi. Will's asleep? Um... Thank you. You're welcome. Room for one more? Why no roof? Dad always left it open. He could watch out for shooting stars. You never told me that. Have you found any? What'd you wish for? I can't tell you. It won't come true. You know, jack's really nice. Yeah, he is. Are you having a good christmas? Yeah, I am. I'm glad. Hey, pal. Hey. You getting an early start? -Yup. -Oh yeah. He could hardly wait for me to finish breakfast. We're almost done. Do you wanna help? Oh, I would but I have practise. They didn't tell you? Tell me what? I don't think you're gonna be having practise today. Why not? Teddy's back in town. Come on, let's go. oh, jack, hi. Yup. Keep coming. okay, a little bit further. Don't peek. And... Stop it, I wanna look! Stop, stop! Okay. Are you good? Are we good? Are we almost ready for this? Will, can I get a drumroll, please? and you can look. will, it's perfect. Really? Oh, it's so wonderful, sweetheart. It looks amazing. Okay, can we come out now? Yes. Yes, you have to come see! Ta-dah! Isn't it good? Oh. Oh, honey. What did your mom think? She liked it. You? It's amazing. Oh, look at the church! I know, that's my favourite part. Do you see the airplane hangar? So, jack, are you joining us tonight? Tonight? It's our family christmas party. Oh, I wouldn't want to intrude on a family event. Oh, lots of people come. I mean, maggie and teddy will be there, you can finally meet him. Okay. Six o'clock. I will be there. Evening, jane. Oh, officer barnes. What can I get ya? You still selling those bottles of millie's spiced cider? Through the new year. Two please. Coming right up. Jack. Roger. Just picking up some cider for the party. Oh, right, I hadn't even thought about that. I should probably order some christmas cookies or something? They own a bakery, pal. Right. What you got there? It's a... A watch. It belongs to the man who saved my life. Hi. Has mom told you yet? Told me what? That's a "no". That couple made mom an official offer today and she accepted. I know. End of an era. Oh, dad wanted me to give you this. What... Open it. He fixed it for you. hi. Hi. -Merry christmas. -Merry christmas. Merry christmas. Hello, jess. Merry christmas. I'll take that. Thank you. Yeah, here- yeah. A little warm in here. I'm really glad you came. Me too. you should ask him to the dance. He's already going to be at the dance. So? Maybe he'd like to be there with you. Hit it. Too slow! Missed. Jack, this is my husband, teddy. Hi. It's really nice to meet you. I've heard a lot of good things. Same. There's mrs. Conroy. I have to talk shop. Can you excuse me? So, you all ready for tomorrow? I hope so. It's really good of you to come all this way to lend a hand. You know, that's not the only reason that I- that I came. I uh... Actually... Uh... Who is that? That's tyler. Katherine's husband. Can I have everyone's attention? I just got the preliminary numbers- have you seen jack? For this year's snowball. No. We've broken all previous ticket records. Hey, there you are. So I have a question. Is something wrong? Do you recognize this? Yeah. It's a bicentennial watch. Read the back, kat. Did this belong to your husband? Yeah. Yeah, he lost it a long time ago. How... How do you have this? I read the volunteer list, he wasn't there. But I only asked beth for the names of the men I... I never considered maybe it was a gift. You volunteered at the bicentennial, didn't you? Yeah. Yeah, and I had it engraved for him before he was deployed. He used to always say that he was counting the hours until we were together again. He wore it all the time. Every time we were apart. You said he was a music teacher. Yeah, yeah. That's what he did when he got out of the service. I still don't understand how you... How you have this. I was stationed overseas. Got into a... A bit of a rough spot. I don't remember much except the medic pulling me out. He was gone before I could even thank him. I didn't even get a name, but he dropped that. I always meant to get it back to him. I don't... I don't know why I took so long. But... When I saw the announcement about the band I thought it was a sign. I... I thought it was the perfect time for me to finally make the trip and find him. I just can't believe this. I know. Kat? Yeah. Sorry, um... Dad's about to start his christmas toast. Okay. I'll be right there. Katherine... I... I should go. I... Thought I might find you here. Am I so predictable? Well, a mother knows. It just seems so unfair. Why is he gone and I'm still here? To live, honey. I see him everywhere. I go to a place that tyler and I went to a thousand times and immediately it's like I'm right back there with him. Like he never left. You share a lot of memories. You tried so hard to put on a brave face for will but pushing tyler away isn't gonna make you heal. You're gonna have to find some peace, hun. And part of that is moving on. You know, I... I finally let myself feel that way again for a second. Jack isn't here because of the band. Here's here because of tyler. I don't understand. When tyler was serving... He saved jack's life. Jack didn't know that it was tyler until today. Oh my... Well, it's pretty remarkable how your lives have intertwined. Sounds to me like a christmas miracle. Oh, honey. I'm sorry, jack. For years I meant to thank him, I just always built it up and it became so big. I always found a reason not to do it and... Now I've waited too long. What're you gonna do now? Nervous? A little. You're gonna be a hit. What's that? It's an early christmas gift. Can I open it? Go ahead. It belonged to your dad. He wore it every time he had to go away. He um, said that whenever he missed us he could look at it and it would make him feel like we were right there with him. I want you to have it. Me? He would want you to have it, too. I don't remember this. Yeah, he uh, he lost it for a little while. After he saved a man's life. He did? He did. Here. I think we should just tuck it right here inside your pocket, right next to your heart. Mom, you're crying. They're just happy tears. It'll be okay. I promise. Oh, don't you two look gorgeous? Go get your coat. We have to head out early but- very handsome. Mom, I need to talk to you. What is it, honey? I don't want you to sell the bakery. Oh- katherine, we've been through this already. I just don't have a choice. Yes you do. You can let me help you. I thought you didn't want to come back. You're right. I was hiding from a place I love, from people I love, because I was hurt. Because I missed my husband. But provincetown isn't just a place. It was our life together. It was a happy life together and I'm tired of hiding from it. If that's what you want. It is. You were right. I just wanna come home. And you know, I've been thinking of some new ideas for those pecan sandies. I'm sure you have. hi. Hi. Oh, you look beautiful. Thank you. Oooh, that dress is amazing. I'll have to borrow it one day. How are mom and dad? We're going to slow things down so grab that special someone and lead them to the dance floor. I have to go. I asked teddy to sit in for a song. Why? So that maybe I could convince you to dance. so what do you say? I tried calling you. I know. I uh... I just needed time. you asked me if I believe in fate. I still don't know the answer to that, but I do believe that people come into your life for a reason. Like tyler did for me. Yeah. and like you did for me. I don't know if it's coincidence or if it's a christmas miracle that brought you into my life but I am so happy that you are here. merry christmas.
