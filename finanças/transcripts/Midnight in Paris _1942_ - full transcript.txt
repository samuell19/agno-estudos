Midnight in Paris Move along! Yes, officer. Which way? Any way you like. Just do it! I'd rather not. If I move along, I'll move away from my work. Because you're working, eh? I've never worked so hard. Is that so? It isn't easy to pretend to be unemployed. May I? Here. Thank you, sir. I'd have given me 20 francs. There's nothing like work, sir. Goodnight, officer. Night. Prince, we're here... Stop fooling around, sir. Hey... Don't play that trick on me, eh? Dead? Is he dead? Don't move, stay where you are, I'll be right back. Emile! Emile! Something's happened, over there! There, what? There's a dead man, a stiff in a morning suit! Come off it! Come off what? The man's dead. Why would I brag about it? He's a drunk! He isn't! I know all about drunks. I specialize in them. He's dead, done for, gone, departed! Show me. Well I never! Do you know many stiffs who drive cars? Well I never! Your dead man's in good health! Well I never! When it comes to drunks, you win hands down. Well I never! Evening, Mr. Cupid. What's on tonight's menu? Tonight I've got... starter: camembert, fish: camembert, plat de resistance: camembert, cheese: camembert. Then if I'm still hungry, I'll have a bit of camembert. And you? Saucisson. I only like saucisson when I'm in the country. And it has to be 100% pork. The way you clean camembert, you'd think we're at the duchess's. I'm delighted you noticed, Mr. Cupid. You're sickeningly distinguished. It comes naturally. As we say in my world, "It's innate." Eh? Innate. Tough luck! Say, Mr. Cupid... I would like your advice. Mind you, I don't really need it but I'd be interested to know what you would do. Don't get ideas though. We're chatting. What would you do if you happened to find a wallet? You've found a wallet? No! Do I look like someone who's found a wallet? Look like? That doesn't mean anything. I found one 2 years ago. No one looked less like it. Did you keep it? What a question! Of course I kept it. I won't be fooled twice. You've lost me. It's very simple. Six months before that, I'd wanted to be honest. I found a wallet with 200 francs in it. As I was seen picking it up, I took it to the police. I even added 10 francs. I figured if a man came in for a wallet with 200 francs, the police would say there was 210 and not give it to him. But he was given it, and my 10 francs too. So I'm done with honesty. Now when I find one, I keep it. I feel bad but... I keep it anyway. What if the wallet contains 1,000-franc notes? You found some? No! It's hypothetical. I have a special technique. 1,000-franc notes for skint blokes like us... it's risky. What's your technique? First you ditch the wallet by stashing it somewhere, with some of the money. You come back for it later. I see! Then you go to the stationer's, buy a plain envelope, put the rest of the money in it and take it to the police. How dishonest! And most importantly, if you found the wallet in Saint Michel, say it was Montmartre. How dishonest! The police won't give a bloke, who says he lost a wallet in Saint Michel, with 100,000 francs in it, an envelope containing 90,000 found in Montmartre. Or there's no justice in the world. How dishonest! After a year and a day, you can claim your cash at the station and even use the wallet. You are dishonest! Aren't you eating tonight? No, I'm not hungry. I'll meet you at home later. That's so dishonest! But it's bloody clever too. I'll have a drink afterwards. All right, sir. What's this? A photograph. Can't you hurry up? Wednesday... June 23rd, at 10:50 at night. 10:50pm. On the escalator at Jules Joffrin metro station, I, Antonio Ramatuel, known as Mr. Mouse, age 65, born in Salon-de-Provence, Bouches-du-Rhone, found a manila envelope. Did you now? I wonder if this isn't a matter for the commissioner. What do you think, Inspector? Carry on. Make sure you list every item. Any previous convictions? - No. His record is clean. Yes, it's squeaky clean. Two 1,000-dollar notes. Two 1,000-florin notes. That's 110,000 francs at today's exchange rate. And... four 5,000-franc notes. That makes exactly 130,000 or so francs, as I already told you. Did you really find it on the metro escalator? Yes. Officer 134 saw me pick it up. Is that true? Yes, sir. He was picking it up as I passed and asked me to witness it. You find envelopes under officers' noses? You're a lucky man. Indeed I am! What should I do? Give me a receipt. In a year and a day, if no one's claimed the money, I'll be a capitalist. Not if we discover things about you. What sort of things? I can understand you can't stand me. I said you were a real sourpuss and I was wrong to. I said you had a mean mug and I was wrong to. I said if you had children they would make lovely bulldogs and I was wrong to. But for you to suspect me because I hand in a wall... an envelope containing 130,000 francs, it's enough to put me off being honest. It's a camembert. Close it before it runs away! Take off your shoes! Why ask me to remove them to question me? I'm more honest barefoot, eh? But I'm happy to oblige. May I, madam? Nothing in my shoes or in my pockets. Thank you, Mr. Lognon. Thank you, madam. How unfortunate to have 130,000 francs and not a penny for a bottle of wine! Get out! But we'll meet again. Alas! On June 24 next year at 10:50pm, I'll be here. Goodbye, Mr. Lognon. My regards to you. DEMOLITION COMPANY Flowers of love Spring does beautiful things As it's nicknamed velvety skin... Don't you think you're cheerful of late? I do indeed. Have you come into an inheritance? You know, money can't buy happiness. Shut the door! There's a draft. You're such a wimp! It's raining roses It's raining roses of love What are you doing? Practicing. Practicing what? The three-card trick. What's the three-card trick? It's a way of making easy money. You go to a small square on market day, sit at a terrace and wait for punters. When a crowd gathers, you say to them, "Here's how to make a fortune quick." Works every time. You show them the ace of hearts, diamonds and of spades. Then you say, "Right, find me the ace of spades. "Find... "the ace of spades.” That's easy! So everyone thinks. Look at the ace of spades. OK. Where is it now? It's there! You found it. Listen, Mr. Cupid, you can't trick me, I've got a beady eye. The first time I always lose. I have to attract punters to find an investor. Now I'm ready for you and your beady eye. Here's the ace of spades. Where's the ace of spades? It's there. No, sir, it's here. I'll do it again. Watch carefully. The ace of spades is here. It goes here. Where's the ace of spades? It's there. No, sir, it's here. You've got something, eh? Probably. I think I've got it. The ace of spades... What's that? What do you think? The ace of spades... Why it's blood! Blood? Why would I have blood on my sleeve? It's blood, I tell you! But... No way! Count me out. What are you imagining? What do you think, when I see blood on your sleeve and you ask me what I'd do if I happened to find a wallet? Mr. Cupid, are you calling me a murderer Maybe you killed... by accident. But if you ask me, such accidents are too risky. You'd inform on me? Course not! But if the police calls, I'll tell them. That's doesn't make sense. Sit down. Let me think. I opened the door. The bloke fell on me. I pushed him. I went to get Emile and the car drove off. Do you know many stiffs who drive cars? Was he dead or not? If he was, he couldn't drive. If he wasn't, how did he get blood on me? Maybe it was when... you took his wallet. Can't you let this wallet business go? It's interesting. I didn't kill him, all right? Or steal his wallet! When the car drove off, I found it in the street. And I figured I'd keep it. Hello? Yes. Commissioner Lucas. Later. I'm busy. Mr. Muller, you were Mr. Negretti's secretary. His private secretary. That's correct, Commissioner. And were you on good terms? Excellent. Excellent? You doubt me? I have reason to. And you, miss? Mr. Negretti is my guardian, as I already told you, sir. You're Hungarian, aren't you? I wish I were Parisian but I was born in Budapest. How come he's your guardian? My mother was very beautiful. God preserve her. I see! Perfect. Mr. Negretti has always been very good to me. Since he took me in in Budapest, I owe him everything. What do you think of Mr. Frederic Muller? Nothing! Nothing at all. Nothing? My guardian found him remarkable. I had no reason to judge him. So explain the altercation they had before you the night he disappeared? The altercation? Indeed. It was during dinner when you had strawberries. When we had strawberries? You had an altercation? Not that I'm aware of. The hotel staff has a better memory. My guardian will explain all that himself. You don't believe he's dead? Mr. Muller was conscientious and ridiculous to inform the police. Mr. Negretti will be furious when he finds out. You can expect a real altercation. May I show you out? Is that all? It's almost a pity. The French police are so kind! Thank you. I hope to see you again. So do |I Somewhere else. Here too maybe. Please remain available for questioning. Both of us? Both of you. With pleasure, sir. After you. The bellboy is outside. Show him in. Come in, you! Take care of it today, OK? Come closer, young man. You have something to tell me. Go ahead. Very well, sir. I saw in the paper you were looking for a grey Talbot. On Wednesday June 23rd, between 9 and 9:30pm, I was on duty outside the Gai Moulin when a tramp called Mr. Mouse... What? What did I tell you? Go on. He's definitely involved! Just wait. Well? What did Mr. Mouse do? Nothing at all! He told me he'd opened the car door, and seen a man who appeared to be dead. What is it? Go on! I said he was probably a drunk and I was proved right. When I went with him to see, the car drove off. Let me bring in Mr. Mouse. I know he's the key to this case. Bring him to the Gai Moulin at 9. Very well. How long have you known this Mr. Mouse? Ladies and gents! I'm not an unscrupulous trader who wants to get rid of his goods. I'm not buying or selling. I'm not here to do business. My aim is philanthropic: to help you make a fortune. You might be wondering why I want to share my secret. Because I'm a philanthropist! Here's what you have to do. See these 3 cards? Find the ace of spades and win 20 francs. If you don't, you lose. Any takers? Of course! Perfect, sir. Here's the ace of spades. The ace of spades... Where's the ace of spades? There! He guessed correctly. What a clever fellow! Who's next? Me! All right, madam. There you go. The ace of spades... Where's the ace of spades? There! I've won! What do you mean? Don't you argue! Of course not. Here. Thank you. What did I do wrong? Who now? Me! OK, OK, you'll all get a go. A soldier. It'll be harder to guess... You'll see. The ace of spades! Watch carefully! The ace of spades... Where is it? There! I won! Again? I never win! My turn! You bunch of sharks! Follow me! Why? I keep losing. For another matter. Just in time. Another 3 goes and I'd have been broke. - The crime scene? - That way. Let's go! Here's the great Mr. Mouse. I'm not that great, sir. Make sure we're not disturbed. Follow me, you two. Let's see... So the grey Talbot was parked in the same spot? Yes, Commissioner. The darkest spot of all. You've noticed too, sir? How many people did you see in it? It was too dark to see. Besides, the windows were wet. We'll do a reconstruction. Go stand by the entrance. All right, sir. Take the dead man's place. Very well, sir. It's a reconstruction, you know. Come on, Mr. Mouse! Do exactly what you did on June 23rd. I can't. Why not? I don't have my umbrella. Do without it. It won't be as good without it. Get on with it! Another dead man? This is too much! I'm not dead, you idiot! My apologies. Mr. Mouse! Sir? This is important. He fell on you, you pushed him then went to get Emile. Did you run? I did indeed. Run then! When do I run? When I say so. Off you go! Hello, Mr. Lognon. Get ready to drive away. Get set! Go! He wasted no time coming round and driving off! And? Either he wasn't dead or unconscious or there was someone else. Evidently. So in your opinion, the man was dead? Not dead, dead drunk. That isn't what you told your pal. He's just an acquaintance. I even said, "I think he's a drunk."” I know all about them. I specialize in drunks. You said he was dead! No. When the car drove off, I said, "Know many stiffs who drive cars, eh?" He's lying! I even added, "Your dead man's in good health!" And you replied, "Well I never!"” Me? Well, one of you thought he was dead. Yes! He did! Thank you, gents. That'll be all for today. Remain available for further questioning. With pleasure. Evening, Mr. Cupid. Say... I've got the police breathing down my neck. No need to worry. You handed the money to the police. What about the wallet? Ah yes, the wallet! I can't hand it in to them. I found a corpse and 100 grand. If I also find a wallet... It's bothersome. Plus the bloke in the car was a big financier. Now I'm mixed up in a millionaire's business. There's nothing worse. You ought to know I pay your salary, Mr. Muller. Is that so, Mr. Negretti? You're my employee. Not my brother's, mine! Possibly. Edgar is - or was - the signatory. I am the director. Indeed. Well? Why not tell me he intended to sell his shares to Christian Osting? I thought - and I was right - that you'd find out. I'm a secretary, not a spy. Your job is to inform the director about his authorized signatory. I wasn't aware he acted without your knowledge. I know you're very astute. And not very scrupulous. I thought you'd consulted each other. That Edgar and I were working against the group? Precisely. You have a low opinion of me, Mr. Muller! You're a formidable financier. Financiers aren't always scrupulous. Be as efficient as you are insolent, you will be a model employee. Please allow me to leave. I shall not. Did Edgar intend to sell all his shares? All of them. But why? I'm a secretary, not a confessor. And did he sell them? Yes, I believe so. What betrayal! It's impossible! Didn't you say when it comes to finance, there's no betrayal, just good or bad operations? It's a bad operation too! He thought otherwise. By selling to Christian Osting, he behaved like an idiot. I'd have paid twice as much! Mr. Edgar often said, "Don't mix family and business." Enough of your insolence! Don't forget you're my employee. And... You asked for me? Good to see you. I've never heard you be so friendly before. Did you know? Of what? Edgar intended to sell his shares. I'm extremely frivolous. He only ever mentions the money I spend. If he had mentioned it, you'd have encouraged him. What are you driving at? Bundles of shares aren't easy to spend. Even for you. Whereas cash... Your brother has disappeared and you're worried about money? And about his disappearance. Is that so? Money is the cause the disappearance the effect I didn't realize. I flew here from Rome to try to clear up this matter. Obviously. I'm just surprised you don't seem upset. You don't seem upset either. I'm different. I'm sure he'll explain everything to you tonight or tomorrow. You think he's hiding? I don't think anything. I told you I was extremely frivolous. But I hope. Oh yes. Hope, he will return soon. You hope? I don't want him out of the way. What do you mean? Why would I punish him? The shares don't hinder me. Are you accusing me? No. You're beyond suspicion. You were in Rome, were you not? Indeed. You couldn't have acted from Rome. You're not powerful or clever enough to do so. Dora, that was a mistake! No. He's furious now. Sure. And? He'll start looking. It's possible. And if he does, he'll find out. You're such a child. Aren't you afraid? No. But I understand you're worried. Let's not stay together. It wouldn't be normal. You're right. I'll go out first. I'm a better actor than you. Any progress on the Negretti case? I found the Talbot's owner. We'll soon know for sure. With this case, your promotion's assured. Touch wood! Sure you've not forgotten anything? Positive. Sit down. You could prove useful. I'm sure I could. Not here. Over there. Sorry. Is your man here? Yes. What's he like? It's hard to say. He's young. Young? Yes, 25 to 28. Well dressed. I'm sure he is. Talbot owners always are. A nice face. Your nice faces aren't the same as mine. Is he nervous? He's petrified. His lips were quivering to the point he... couldn't hold his cigarette. Very interesting! Let's see him. I will only speak in the presence of my lawyer. Mr. Osting! Do come in. Have a seat, sir. You're not in a hurry? I didn't hear you. Me neither. I asked if you were in a hurry. No, sir. Glad to hear it. I hope you have plenty to tell me. I don't think so. No? I've plenty to tell you. Do have a seat. You lent Mr. Negretti the grey Talbot he was seen in the night he disappeared? Yes, sir. Why did you lend it to him? We were doing business. Really? He was only supposed to spend a few days in Paris. He had lots to do. Asked me to lend it to him. Asked you? Yes, as I didn't need it... But, tell me, why didn't you inform the police? Surely you knew we were looking for it. I was about to tell you I didn't need it because I wasn't in Paris. Is that so? But you had a meeting with him on June 23rd. That's right. A very important meeting? Yes. You left Paris without wondering why he didn't turn up? But he did turn up. What? At what time? At 8:15 in the evening. You were among the last to see him then, Possibly. Will you excuse me? Someone will be very interested in what you have to say. That's better! I needed a breather. You know each other. I've no need to introduce you. Do have a seat. You were right. Mr. Osting met your brother on Wednesday at 8:15pm. After which he left Paris. Are you sure you left Paris? Yes. I didn't hear you, sir. No. No? You didn't leave Paris. So you knew about our investigation. Why conceal such important facts for several days? Why? I was afraid. Afraid of what? I had no alibi. I figured everything would look bad. Everything? What? At Negretti's request, my staff had the night off. I see! He could have come up with something more ingenious. What time do you claim Mr. Negretti left? Claim? He left my house at 8:30pm and drove away in my car. He had another meeting. Do you honestly believe that? Lognon! Commissioner? Show him out! I'd be happy to leave. But do you honestly believe that? Goodbye, gentlemen. Goodbye, Mr. Lognon. Did Mr. Negretti tell you who this meeting was with? Excuse me, Commissioner. May I ask a question? Go ahead. Is it true you and my brother were negotiating the purchase of his shares? We weren't negotiating, we'd struck a deal. That's impossible! The shares are with my bank. Have you paid for them? How dare you, sir! It's a simple question. Yes, I paid for them. How? With a bank check. Did you give it to him? On Wednesday June 23rd when we met. He hasn't been seen since. Must I put up with this? Mr. Negretti, kindly change your tone. Forgive me, Commissioner. May I ask one last question? If you mind your words. Was the check signed by you? No. Interesting! Don't get too excited. My bank advanced the money. It was a bank to bank check. The shares were a guarantee. If you got rid of the check, you could keep the lot. If we could find the check, your situation would be a whole lot better. Indeed. But how? And now, we change roles! What's that? Don't be afraid! Hey, sonny, would you like a sweetie? Edgar! Say sorry to the man! There's no need, madam. I told you to say sorry. Sorry. Here. Off you go! I don't know what to say. He's a very modern child. - He deserves a good hiding. - He aimed at you. Because I'm a likeable fellow. Goodbye. You seem familiar, madam. I live locally. I knew it. Why do you say that? No reason. Mummy, Mummy! Darling, it's nothing. Never mind. Never mind? I'd like to see you fall. Let's go home then. You're ever so strong! I didn't hurt you, eh? You haven't pinched me. I'm embarrassed. He's no heavier than a piano. Do you lift pianos too? No, I imagine not. Is that you, Lucile? Why are you home so early? I've broken my leg, sir. You've broken your leg? He's exaggerating. Put him on the couch. All right then. There you go, sonny. You'll be comfy like that. It's only a small cut. He's twisted his ankle. Poor old Edgar! I'm sick! I hope you'll give me some chocolate. You don't miss a trick. Put him to bed. I'll give him a compress. Come on, sonny. No! I want Mr. Laborde to carry me this time. May I? Please do. I ought to say sorry for earlier. Why? I'd have been nicer if I'd seen you were badly dressed. Edgar! I'm not badly dressed. - I'm actually awfully chic. - This is the old style. That's right! But you forgive me, don't you? Of course! So badly dressed! It isn't perfect of course, but I'm not that badly dressed. Don't be angry with the boy. He has no manners. His mother and I spoil him rotten. His father is often away. We don't slap him enough. Is that his father? That's right. They're getting married soon. I don't know what he's waiting for. Lucile is so nice. Decent, honest and devoted. She's too good for him. Mind you, he isn't a bad sort. But he's stupid. How about a drink? I wouldn't say no. Is this the father too? Yes. What does he do? He's an idiot. That isn't an occupation! I can say he's an idiot, he's my best friend. In his spare time, he's a stamp broker like me. That's an occupation, is it? Yes, indeed. We buy and sell stamps. We search far and wide, he's away right now. There are folks who buy stamps? Don't insist, you'll upset me. Yes... It doesn't seem very profitable. Edgar is an eccentric, you know. He has very simple tastes. His name's Edgar too? Edgar Leroy, with a Y Her name is Lucile Boisvin. They've been together 9 years. He makes 60,000 francs a year. She used to be a secretary. She's an orphan. She goes to the cinema Thursdays and Saturdays. Is that enough information? I was just asking, you know. Don't go hoping for a reward. She isn't wealthy. He gives her the bare minimum. I hope she won't give it to me! You're a likeable fellow. Sorry. Cheers! I live right next door, you know, if ever you need me. It's very unlikely I'll come and buy your stamps. You're funny! Goodbye, Lucile! I'm leaving. Goodbye then. Goodbye, sir. Has Mr. Laborde gone? Yes. He's charming. Amusing too, eh? He's a rough diamond, you know. We're all fond of him. Especially the little one. We've only known him a year but he's one of the family. Do sit down. I insist. I'm obsessive... but I get the impression I know your... well, Mr. Leroy. I'd be surprised! He's a bear. He has to travel a lot but he's a real homebody. Does he wear a morning suit for work? No, never! I'm sure I saw him in one. Him? Where? Near a smart restaurant in a big grey car. He only takes the metro. Maybe one of his friends lent it to him. They'd only lend him a bus ticket! I see. It's odd though... It seems... His little moustache and his face does seem familiar though. Maybe he has a twin! Maybe. He's away in Amsterdam and won't be back till Saturday. I do beg your pardon, madam. I'm keeping you with my questions. I've plenty of time. Edgar is sleeping. Thank you for being so kind. I'm sorry he was so rude to you. It's of no importance. He didn't notice I was badly dressed. That proves I'm naturally distinguished. You are. I can see you weren't always... what you are. Is it that noticeable? That's bothersome! Why? Because I wouldn't like the people who knew me before to recognize me. What did you do? I taught music theory. And I inherited a bit of money. What happened? What can I say? A woman. She was crazy. I was crazy about her. We had a swell time. But when I ran out of money, she left me. She wasn't that crazy. But I took it hard. I ended up falling apart. I shouldn't have asked. On the contrary. Now and then I need to remind myself I was happy once and I'm paying for it now. I'd like to help you. Ah no! You'll spoil everything. Goodbye, madam. No, no. There's no need to show me out. And you know, madam, my crazy girl was ever so pretty. I'm more stubborn than you. See? I was right to be. Come into my office. That's why I'm here. So? Are you hiding? Not from you. Although we've nothing to say to each other, I'll always be willing to answer. Whatever the question is? No matter what it is. Admit you did not give a check to my brother. Admit you were furious about the deal between us. If you did give him a check, you tried to get it back. You tried to punish him for betraying you. We're off to a bad start. We're convinced each other wanted my brother out of the way. Isn't that so? As far as I'm concerned, yes. You forget I wasn't in Paris. Everyone seems to. Yes, I know, you have an excellent alibi. The better the alibi, the more suspect you are. In that case, you're not suspect. However, until proven otherwise, a good alibi is better than no alibi at all. Maybe not. You killed him! You're blinded by grief. The check was never cashed. Don't you find that odd?? He had a reason not to cash it. An important reason. If he was dead... I've no more to say to you. Let justice be done. Be reasonable. You're lost. Allow me to make you an offer. I've nothing to say to you! I loved my brother. But I'm a practical man. I'm what you think you are: a financier. I cannot allow my brother's madness to ruin 2,000 shareholders who trusted us. I'm willing to forget what I know. Is that so? Give me his shares. We'll forget the check. I will drop all charges. I'll come up with an explanation and, if need be, an alibi. I hate to seem ridiculous. You're such a cynical man. But I must ask you to leave. Very well. You'll be sorry. Maybe. Have 48 hours to think about it. I don't need 48 hours. Justice will take its course. So be it. The police will be thorough. I hope so. I'll see you in court. Your picture is in the papers. Just like a murderer! Yes. You're ever so kind. I'm in a hurry! I'm going. Mr. Mouse! Yes? Here! Finish the lady's shoes. I've got an errand to run. Go on. I recognize you. You're the famous Mr. Mouse. Not that famous, madam. But everyone has heard of me. I'm done. Allow me to brush you. That's 2 francs The tip isn't included. Here's 5 francs. Keep the change. Thank you. Till next time! See you tomorrow. Yes. Sit down, sir. Are you Mr. Mouse? Yes, sir. I'm the very Parisian and well-known Mr. Mouse. Sir! I'm very interested in the Negretti case. I'm not. On reading the paper, I had the impression you knew a lot more about it. You know journalists, sir. They always exaggerate. Like I said, I'm so interested in the Negretti case that I'm willing to give 100,000 francs to whoever finds the gentleman's wallet. Sorry, sir. Why are you telling me? I'm not telling you in particular. But there's a check in the wallet. It's very important I get it back. I said everything I had to say to the police. I'm not saying you know something. But I know I'll give 100,000 francs. 100,000 francs? Yes. I'm not saying I know something either but I do know an awful lot of people. Sorry, sir. If I met someone interested in these 100,000 francs then maybe I could call you. Couldn't I, sir? Kleber 50-06. Sorry, sir. Kleber 50-067? Very well, sir. If you like, I could come here every day and check in with you. No. It reeks of Lognon here. What? I know what I mean. No, I prefer Kleber 50-06. There you go, sir. As you wish. Allow me, sir. Sorry, sir. I'm a woman who knows how to command respect! Come now, madam. What is it? There you are, darling! It's true that Paris is a modern-day Babylon. I was waiting quietly when this vile man slid his hand along the seat. I daren't say why! Did you do that? Come now, sir. It does seem unbelievable. Ask him why he was rummaging in the gap in the seat. No one has ever been so disrespectful to me. He was disrespectful to you? Who are you? I don't know you. Inspector Lognon, police Press charges. I'll take care of it. You must be mad. It would cause such a scandal. Go ahead. Hey! I need you. Why? I haven't done anything. To go to the morgue. The morgue? We've found Edgar Negretti's body. We need to know if it's the man you saw in the car. Is that really necessary? Don't argue! I'll faint at the morgue. Come on! That's enough. Why are you tiptoeing? I thought it was... You won't disturb anyone here. I think I'm going to faint. I could do with a drink. Afraid of facing your victim? Not at all! I'm not good with the dead. I once helped out at an undertaker's. They offered me a good job but I couldn't accept. Come on! If I faint, it'll be your fault. Please follow me, gentlemen. How awful! Do you recognize him? Sadly, there's no doubt about it. It is poor Edgar. And you? Yes, it's the man who was in the car. Be brave, sir! Please forgive me. I'm not a weakling but... it's terribly upsetting to know he died angry with me. Come on, sir. As you saw, I didn't nearly pass out. What do you mean? What do I mean? Have you seen him? Yes. And? Didn't you notice anything? Didn't you see that... Come on! He's the murderer. It's so obvious. He's a new Cain, as they say. Is that so? You think a gentleman who is in Rome can kill someone in Paris? He was in Rome? Yes. That is bothersome. It certainly is! Maybe he got someone else to kill his brother. Of course! It's so simple. I'm devastated, Commissioner. We didn't get on but... what a terrible way to go. He paid for his follies. Which follies? There were so many. When you arrest Christian Osting, do your utmost to avoid a scandal. It would spell financial disaster. We don't intend to arrest him, not yet at least. What more proof do you need? I suppose it's your business. I'm going away for a few days. On my return, I hope you agree with me. Tell me, do witnesses get paid? No, nothing. Well, they ought to. What's that? It's a photo of the dead man! Gosh! Where did you get this? Who? Me? You found it, It'll be yours in a year and a day. I only find 1,000-franc notes. When he gave the man a tip, who dropped it. Yes, maybe. Excuse me! Did you drop this photograph? I don't know. I've never seen this portrait of my brother. Who's the woman? No idea. I don't know the child either. That's strange. I would be most grateful if you believed me. We do believe you. We simply need to find out who the woman and child are. Take care of it at once. How do you expect me to find her? Just find her! If you need to contact me, I will be at my branch in Baste from tomorrow. Goodbye, gentlemen. Goodbye, sir. Far be it from me to give advice but I'd deal with him rather than the woman. We can do both. And deal with you too! I'm not interesting, but if it amuses you.. Get out. Goodbye, gentlemen. That Simon Negretti strikes me as odd too. Check in when he landed at the airport. You can deal with the woman later. Was that you making a racket? Sorry. I've something important to tell Miss Boisvin. Why it's our friend from the other day! Something important to tell her? It's important for me. She went out. She won't be home till dinnertime. I must speak to her. You can wait in my flat. I'll leave the door open. She often pops in. Thank you. Come in Thank you. Come and sit down. Come on, I insist. No. I can't. Do you have sciatica? Not at all. I'm on edge. How about a glass of red? No. Thank you. Come on. It's good for the nerves. I'm out of sorts. I'd drink distractedly. It's a waste. What's the matter? I've got problems. Money problems? No! I've not had any for years. I don't care about money. In 359 days, I'll be rich. In 359 days? Yes. You wouldn't understand. Well? They definitely mustn't know Miss Boisvin has already seen me. Who's "they"? Let's change the subject! I'm so on edge that I drunk my wine without even realizing. The police? What about them? Is "they" the police? In a word, yes. I'm glad you warned me. I might have told them without realizing. I saw you at her house too. Ah, that's true! Why mustn't the police know you've already seen her? They would find it strange. Really? It isn't good to be strange. No? Especially when you can't explain your strange behaviour. And... is that your case? I'm a southerner and very imaginative. But I don't know what to make up so they'll believe me. It's that bad, eh? It's because of the wallet. Because there's a wallet? It wouldn't interest you. But it would interest them. You found a wallet? Me? I never said that! That's what I mustn't say. Where did you find it? This wine is good. Macon 1936 or 19377 It's been watered down but it's good. Won't you tell me where? No. I'll be in even more danger. Lucile has nothing to do with the police! But she does, the poor girl! Why? She waited too long to marry and now it's too late. What do you mean? Mr. Leroy won't be coming home. Why? He's dead. How awful! Poor little Lucile. Did he have an accident? A kind of deliberate accident. He got a bullet in the neck. That's unbelievable! What's even more unbelievable is Leroy was not Leroy! He was a great financier Edgar Negretti. Authorized signatory of the international group. Edgar Negretti? Yes, dear fellow, your friend was a millionaire. Ah! I understand everything now. Some of the things he said, his silences, his absences... And his stamps! His stamps? A fabulous collection. Some are worth 50 to 100,000 francs! Supposedly clients' stamps he'd been asked to sell. It's a bit much. My dear man, you look furious. I'm not furious, but why would such a rich man make Lucile and the lad live so badly? He wanted to be loved for himself. Women often love us for our money. And I know all about that! Poor little Lucile! We'll have to break it to her gently before the police tells her Edgar is dead. Yes? Put him on. Just a moment. Hello? Is that you, Chaussin? Well? Obviously! Don't take your eye off him, even for a second. Is that clear? If Mr. Osting shakes you off, I swear you'll hear about it! What? This came from the laboratory. The letter found on the victim. They had trouble deciphering it. It had been in the water so long they pieced it together syllable by syllable. Is Dr. Olivier sure this is right? Absolutely positive. It's from our Hungarian friend. I see... It's an interesting letter. Listen to this. "You were too hard on him." On who? You're asking too much! Negretti was hard on someone and Miss Dora isn't pleased. That's all we know. I'll go on... "A man should not be condemned for a moment of madness. "Be generous-hearted or he'll act out of desperation... Hang on! This is the best bit. "And you'll be sorry." Well I never. Our pal Muller has reappeared. Don't you mean Osting? No, I mean Muller. Osting has nothing to do with Miss Dora. It wasn't Osting that Negretti was hard on. Osting didn't have a moment of madness. Nor did he act out of desperation! It was our pal Muller. And Osting? I'm not giving up on Osting or Simon Negretti. Both of them could be guilty. But for the time being I'm dealing with Mr. Muller. Hello? Yes. What? Excellent. Arrest her. Treat her gently but arrest her. Don't let her get away! The Parisian loving Miss Dora was tired of Paris. She was on the Orient Express. How about that? That is a turn up for the books. Police! Miss, I would be delighted to accompany you. Are you arresting me? No. We'd be sad to see you go. You could've told me before I bought my ticket! Why didn't you mention what happened at the club? I didn't deem it necessary. It had nothing to do with the case. Are you sure? Positive. You lost 60,000 francs last Sunday. That's right. Yet, you have no money. Indeed. You asked for 48 hours and you were given them. You could even add I was desperate. Yes! So much so that your opponent had already written off the 60,000 francs. He told me. He thought you'd be found dead the following morning. I'm not dead. It's not a reproach. Not yet at least? You're too kind. But I can't help being surprised by the coincidence. You had an altercation with Negretti. An altercation? A heated discussion with him. He disappeared, and the following day you paid the 60,000 francs. A terrible coincidence indeed. But a pure coincidence. Where did you find the money? Mr. Negretti gave it to me. When? Just after our "altercation”. Is that so? It isn't as extraordinary as it sounds though. There was an awful condition. That's understandable! You don't just give people 60,000 francs. What was this awful condition? That I forget about Dora. Gosh! And was Miss Dora told of this? - No. She doesn't know, does she? No. She'd already gone out when he proposed his arrangement. Arrangement? Yes. Why is no one questioning me? No idea. If I'm here, I'm a suspect. I want to be questioned. Don't worry you will be. Right now. Why did you want to leave Paris? You didn't want to avoid justice, did you? Didn't you wanted to be questioned? Leave us. Did you know Mr. Muller lost 60,000 francs? Yes. Did you also know he refunded them? I knew it. That really didn't surprise you? No. I knew three of his friends clubbed together to lend it to him. But... they wish to remain anonymous. Really? That isn't what he said. I imagine he told you that it was Mr. Negretti who... Who helped him out. He shouldn't have. I told him you wouldn't believe him. You're right. We don't believe him. Could you tell me confidentially the names of these 3 heroic friends? No. Why did he conceal this act of generosity? I'd rather tell you the truth. Again! I lent him the money. As you can imagine, he isn't proud of it. And where did you get it? Your guardian never gave you money. He simply paid your debts. He didn't kill him! I'm sure he didn't do it. You don't believe that. Is that why you were leaving? Afraid you'd give him away? Why didn't he tell me? I would have said whatever he wanted. I know that. And I'm paying for that. Me... I'll punish myself, I'll punish myself! All done! Keep an eye on her. She might do something stupid. So are we arresting Muller? I already had two culprits, and here's a third. Let's not be hasty. There could be more. Mr. Mouse, what can I get you? I just wanted to sit down there. I'm afraid you can't. The painters are here. How will you put back all these seats in the right place? We'll put them back any old how. If you do it on purpose, obviously... I'm sorry, I see you have a visitor. I'll be off. Goodbye, Mr. Cupid. See you soon at home. Yes. Well! Mr. Lognon. Do you still think I'm guilty? I didn't club myself! Maybe your accomplice wanted to get rid of you. Remember what I said, your life is in constant danger. Well, I won't stand for it. I'll go down fighting. I'm pleased to hear that because... I've got an idea. Huh? What? I could put you in jail. What for? But I've got a better idea. As you can imagine, your killer won't leave it at that. I hope he will! He wanted to get you but he messed up. You think he'll try again? I certainly hope so. Thanks a lot! When you're back on your feet, you'll stroll the streets. We'll follow you without being seen. We'll wait for the last minute and when he hits you, we'll nab him. Not before? We'll try. Not good enough. Did I ask your opinion? But I don't have a spare head! See you when you get out. Say, Mr. Lognon, do you know about lion hunts? Not much. Well... You tie a goat to a post and wait for a lion to approach the fresh meat. When he does, you shoot him between the eyes. I never thought I'd be the goat! Mr. Mouse? Mr. Laborde, how are you? And you? May I give you this piece of literature? Thank you. What happened to you? I was in the hospital. I came face to face with a club. With a club? Any blue Guatemalan stamps? Just a minute. I'll leave you to your customer. Here. Goodbye, Mr. Laborde. Had an answer? No. I'd have called you. The reward still holds. Yes, but my friend... I don't know anything. My friend could help you. There's no need to explain. I'm glad to hear it. Avenue Kleber, 50-06 OK. Thank you. Take this. Thanks. Don't lose sight of me! Just relax. I can't relax! I feel like a walking target. Nab him before! Don't worry. Off you go! It's best we split up. Don't forget my orders: intervene at the last minute. Off you go! Mr. Mouse? Mr. Negretti. What are you doing? Acting the goat. Sorry? You wouldn't understand. I'm going to Amsterdam. See you at the bank next week. We can have a chat. We could have dinner together. Something to read perhaps? Police! You're making a big mistake. ...five-seater, black... Registration number: 323 or 328 RM. I'll pass it on. Right then, 323 or 328 RM. Hello. Talbot? Grey? 323 or 325 RM. All 75 Paris police stations have been informed. Every station in France will know in 15 minutes. Excellent. Police rescue, number 10. The car has left Paris by the Porte d'ltalie. Right! Just as I feared. Jim, how about we drive him around some more? I don't see the point. In case we have to get rid of this old man. Me? Get rid of him? He'd be one hell of a heavy stiff. Yes, I'm ever so heavy. If we have to carry him, it won't be easy. For sure. Best forget about it right now. The car entered Paris by the Porte de Charenton. That's better! It went down Avenue Daumesnil, 20 minutes ago. Boulevard des Filles du Calvaire, 15 minutes ago. Boulevard Sebastopol, 10 minutes. They're heading to Montmartre. The car disappeared in this sector. It's reached its destination. It hasn't been seen for 10 minutes. Send a van to Abbesses. Make sure the officers are at the ready. Right, chief! It's a good job Mouse foresaw everything, even your failure, dear Lognon! Yes, it is a good job. But I'll get my revenge. Right, pal, you've got some explaining to do. OK. I thought... Shut it! You've no conversation. You always say the same thing. This gentleman wants me to explain. Where's the wallet? What wallet? Don't be a wise guy. Tell us where it is! Never. Want Charlet to ask you? I won't tell him either. He has ways of making you talk. Charlet! It's your turn. I refuse to talk. Don't hit me on the head. No! You'll ruin my hat. Right... I put the... I put the wallet between... the back and... in the gap between the seat... At La Belote in the 18th. 73 Rue Lamarck. I've told you everything. Don't hit me! Off you go, you two. - You'd better not be lying. - I can rest easy now! Do you only have one? Yeah. Smoking a thing like that is hard work. Are you keeping me company, sir? Sure am. What are we waiting for? The boss. The boss? He's a good friend of mine. You don't know him. I don't, eh? Do you want to bet? If you like. 5 francs. Done. Done? 5 francs! Yeah. God, I should've said 10 francs. There, I've won. Come in, my dear man. We were expecting you. What's keeping them? Maybe I got the time wrong. I'll call the chief. A mint lemonade. OK. Same for me. OK. It must be them. Let's go. No. We wait for the chief. Lost something, sir? Just a button. Just a button? But buttons are useful. I told you not to bother! We've been had! Come on, let's go! Why isn't Mr. Negretti here? He's as much a suspect. At least. He left for Amsterdam. We couldn't reach him in time. I bet he did! Here are our customers, chief! And here's the wallet. Ah! Thank you. Look at these two men. Which do you work for? Mr. Osting or Mr. Muller? Neither of them, my dear Lognon. I have the proof here of these men's innocence. The receipt for the 60,000 Mr. Negretti lent you, Mr. Muller. And the check for 1,000 dollars you told us about. It also clears Miss Dora, who tried to hoodwink us to save the man she loves. So who's the culprit? No one could have suspected the truth. You kept your cards close to your chest. Thank you. Go keep watch. I want a word with our friend here. Have a seat. We'll wait for the gentlemen to return with the wallet. Cigarette? The condemned man's cigarette! Hey... you weren't expecting me, eh? I was in a way. It was equally likely the murderer was Christian Osting or you. What? Yes. Why me? Negretti had two appointments the night of June 23rd: one with Christian Osting and one with you, which no one knew about. He'd just shown you his stamp. Go on. This is very interesting. You meet him in the Talbot and eliminate him. Then I show up. You lie down in the car. The wallet falls out of the door. It's as if we are there. I go for help. I come back with the bellboy Emile. And at that moment, you disappear in a hurry. I find the wallet in the street. Yes. You're very smart. This is it. OK, what now? We climb over. Come on! You go to the right and you go that way. Where's Mr. Mouse? Answer me! Find him yourself. Arrest him. Here they are! Who's the lazy sod who polished your shoes? He did a lousy job, you know. Run all you like! You're staying with me. Welcome, gentlemen! Get down! Come on. I thought to myself, "There are lots of stamps in this story. "Instead of looking for Mr. Negretti's killer, "it'd be better to look for Mr. Leroy's.” I told you, chief. He's smart. Evidently. It was very smart. I'm not smart. I'm just of average intelligence. I didn't know you collected stamps. For years now, I've been a phila... phila... The word's too hard to say! I didn't imagine you so brave. You were gutsy, daring. I played the goat as well as the lion. This man's hilarious! Goodnight to you. Goodnight, sir. I never want to hear about you again. You never will. Actually, you will in a year. Why's that? Why? To collect my envelope. Your envelope? That's right. The envelope... You know, I... The officer saw me pick it up. Don't insist! Well, I am insisting. You shouldn't. Why? I'll ask you to explain and you'll be in hot water. Really? Absolutely. I see! I won't insist then. Good. And... Tell me, sir, what about the reward? What reward? Mr. Osting's. He promised 100,000 to whoever found the wallet! You won't get them. Why? He's setting sail from Bordeaux for the colonies. He didn't waste any time! He's forgotten about you. So don't insist. OK, I won't insist. And the bonus? What bonus? Don't you get one for stopping a killer? No. That'd put any brave man off! Indeed. Want some good advice? Get out of here! And keep a low profile or I'll ask why you put half the wallet's contents in an envelope to fool the police. You could get 5 years inside. Understand? Yes. It's very easy to understand. Right, well... Thank you, gentlemen. Goodbye, gentlemen. I'll never open a dead man's car door again! There you are. They kept you for ages at the police station. They must've asked you for a lengthy explanation! Are you OK! You dare ask if I'm OK? Thanks to your idea of taking money from the wallet, I went barefoot, I was followed like a crook, I ruined my socks, I got shot at, I got clubbed on the head, and you ask me if I'm OK! I had my picture in the paper, just like murderers, I almost got arrested for indecent behaviour, I lost 100 francs, and you ask me if I'm OK! I was questioned for hours, I visited a morgue, I was kidnapped, I played the goat in a lion hunt, and you ask if I'm OK! I almost got the money in the wallet, the 100,000 francs Mr. Osting offered, florins, dollars, Swiss francs... I'm reduced to opening car doors and eating Camembert, I don't even have 50 cents, and you ask if I'm OK! I guess I was wrong to. Goodnight. Goodbye! Goodnight, Mr. Cupid! Fancy calling yourself Cupid with a mug like that! 130,000... Plus an extra 100... 230,000. Dollars, florins, Swiss francs... THE END
