Hi, this is Eric Clapton here. I just want to uh... Express my sadness and uh... To say, thank you, to my dear friend B.B. King. I want to thank him for all the inspiration and encouragement he gave me as a player over the years and for the friendship that we enjoyed. Um... There's not a lot left to say because this music, um... It's almost a thing of the past now. So, uh, if you're not familiar with his work then I... I would encourage you to go out and find an album called, B.B King Live at the Regal. Which is where it all really started for me as a young player. [acoustic guitar playing] [Eric] I had a blissful childhood. I was raised with a great deal of love by my parents. Especially by my mother. Because she loved me in an unconditional way. [Rose speaking] [ Puffin' Billy playing] [Eric] People say I was pretty spoilt and I was selfish. I'm sure I must've had some qualities, but not from what I hear. I was very fond of painting and drawing. Anything that was introverted. [Rose speaking] [Eric] I knew that I was different. And I knew that other kids at school regarded me as different or maybe inferior and I did have a massive inferiority complex. And I didn't know why. Then I found out that my sister was really my mother. She left when I was very, very young and I was raised by my grandparents. [Rose speaking] [Sylvia] Pat was very lively, very difficult youngster. She wasn't easy. Rose used to say she was a nightmare. She met this Canadian. He was over here in England in the village. And it was one-night-stand. In those days to be pregnant and young and you're not married was awful. Ric was born and she just went to Canada. If Rose and Jack hadn't have taken him on, I don't know what would have happened to him. I really don't. [Eric] I felt hurt. Very, very upset. At that point I mistrusted everybody including my grandparents. I was so confused. It seemed to me that my life had been a lie. [blues riff playing on guitar] [man on radio] Hello, children everywhere. This Uncle Mac. Good morning, to you all. Here in London on Saturday. [Eric] Uncle Mac was on the radio on Saturday morning. And he would play a variety of music for kids. How Much Is That Doggie In The Window? All those kind of novelty things he would play. And then, every now and then, he'd play some different music. ♪All that time ♪ ♪ Man, I've laid in my bed so long... ♪ [Eric] You didn't hear that anywhere else. Except on this kiddie's program. And I thought, aw, man, this is just for me. ♪ The landlady decided to call ♪ I was too evil to answer the phone ♪ [Eric] I didn't even know that it was black music. I didn't know about black and white being different stuff. But something about it got me. Something stirred me. Without me even being aware of it. It took all the pain away. Well, obviously when I got to the age to buy records, I went and bought them. [harmonica playing] [Rose speaking] [acoustic guitar playing] [Eric] I could get the record player down to the level that was right and play along to my heart's content. Non-stop. [Rose speaking] [Eric] It was always one man with his guitar versus the world. He was completely alone and had no options other than to just sing and play to ease his pain. And that echoed what I felt. So, more and more and more and more, I wanted to be like that. I enrolled in Kingston School of Art when I was 15. And I was really gripped by the experience of getting involved in a life in the arts. I wanted to know about French literature. I wanted to know about French cinema, Japanese cinema. I read Baudelaire. I read Kerouac, Ginsberg and Steinbeck. But I was absolutely addicted to blues. Totally obsessed. I had a record collection. And I was skiving off a lot. Going to try and find imports in jazz record stores. Muddy Waters, B.B King, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. [Mojo Working playing] ♪ Got my mojo working but it just won't work on you ♪ ♪ Got my mojo working but it just won't work on you ♪ ♪ I wanna love you so bad till I don't know what to do ♪ [Eric] There seemed to be nobody that I could talk to, would have any interest in this. You had to travel miles to find another person. We used to meet up at the Marquee Club up in Oxford Street. The blues night was a Thursday night. And you would meet like minds there and just dance. I met Mick and Keith and Brian over there. They were just part of this crew that would go there. ♪ Got my mojo working ♪ ♪ Got my mojo working ♪ ♪ Got my mojo working ♪ ♪ Got my mojo working... ♪ [Eric] And so blues music led me to the friends that I was gonna have. [knocking] [Ben Palmer] In those days, there was very little interest in the blues. It wasn't popular music in this country at all. I was one of those snobby purist people. And I got very interested in a style of piano playing, played by Muddy Waters' pianist, Otis Spann. I thought well, this music belongs in a band, really. So, I advertised in the Melody Maker. This bass player got in touch with me. Well, he said, "If only we could find a guitar player. "We could really start to get this music working together." [ Steppin' Out playing] We hired a room in a pub with a piano and this little fellow walked in the door with a guitar. He was about 17. [music continues] It was instantly clear that he had a tremendous gift and had worked really hard to develop it. We couldn't believe how good he was. It was a very small outfit with no equipment. We all went through one amplifier. Vocals, guitars and everything. We did more rehearsing than playing. But it was fun. [music continues] [Eric] Ben was the person I knew, from the minute I met him was a serious guy. And he was a great piano player. He was a deep inspiration for me. And a kind of father figure too. [Ben] I thought Eric had an obsessive interest in music. I thought it was the very core of his being, really. He was very friendly but very private too. And he tended to form very close relationships with people suddenly, none of which ever lasted for any length of time. Anyway, Eric decided he was going to be a professional musician and so he had to make a career move. [man 1] Ten, nine, eight... [man 2] All right, take one now. When you're ready.

And we're having a good time, you know, with Freddy and the Dreamers, and The Yardbirds and everybody. It's good. [Eric] We were considered a good live act. We were asked to do The Beatles Christmas show. And we thought they were wankers. But I got on with George very well because he was a guitar player. [George Harrison] We were both in bands and we did a Christmas season in the Hammersmith Odeon together and Eric was in The Yardbirds. And we met then. [cheering] [The Beatles singing] ♪ Can't do that ♪ [Eric] So people that came to see Yardbirds were really into the music. When The Beatles came on, they'd just start screaming so that you couldn't actually hear anything but the screaming. We would watch from the wings and I would see how pointless these guys thought it all was. Already. [harmonizing] George was clearly an innovator. But the sad part was that no one listened. And I thought The Yardbirds had real understanding about what it was really all about. And it wasn't about being famous or getting on TV or having a hit. [cheering] [indistinct chatter] [ For Your Love playing] [Chris] Jim, Keith and myself started to have many ideas about areas of music we wanted to pursue. And when the music publisher came along with the song For Your Love, it just felt absolutely right. ♪ I'd give you everything and more ♪ ♪ And that's for sure ♪ [Eric] It was pop. All the material we were doing was blues music which hadn't even properly filtered through to the mainstream here. So we were pioneering something. I noticed they were deliberately growing Beatles haircuts. I thought we've sold out. I've sold out. I've gotta get out of here. [Chris] Eric played on the studio sessions for For Your Love. And then immediately left. We had this massive record suddenly and no lead guitar player. [Eric] I was so disheartened by the music business, because it seemed to me that everywhere I looked everyone was on the make. I think I was probably a nasty piece of work to have around, you know, if you were tryin' to launch into the successful music world. [creaking] [thud] [Ben] Eric came to my house in Oxford. I was living on my own so, it was a one to one thing. And we just talked. [Eric] I wanted his advice on what to do because I liked playing the guitar and I love blues music. But I thought I was gonna give up everything. And I stayed with him for about two weeks and watched him carve. [Ben] We both have pretty dysfunctional families. And we would sort of sit and talk about these things. And I thought his interest in his music was so obsessive that he didn't really have a choice about what he was doing with his time. He just had to go where it was best to go. I'm sure it's been with him all his life. [Eric] And while I was there someone tracked me down. And it was John Mayall. [indistinct television chatter] [laughing] Thanks, Bu. And before we run out of time, I think it's about time we learn to do the Crocodile Walk, with Johnny Mayall and the Bluesbreakers. ♪ See that crocodile walk ♪ ♪ Hey, and he lookin' my way ♪ [Bob Dylan speaking] ♪ Any minute today ♪ ♪He got a long way to walk ♪ ♪ Lookin' for a home ♪ ♪Yeah, I wanna see you smile ♪ ♪ And, hey, hey, crocodile ♪ ♪ Yeah, crocodile now tell me ♪ ♪ He might settle down now, baby ♪ ♪Ooh, yeah ♪ ♪Hey, hey, crocodile ♪ [John] When it came to blues there was nobody like him. Eric was that special. He knew the history of it. The background of it. And he had the emotional feel for it. And the technique to express it. He was given this freedom to let loose. ♪ Disappearing in the dark ♪ [Alex Hooper] Eric, how much do you think that his influence helped blues based bands? [Eric] If you're gonna take it back to the roots it's between him and Alexis Korner and they're the ones that started actually physically playing it. And there were lots of people that collected old blues records but that didn't play. But he worked in the clubs playing it. I mean, he's responsible for the whole thing, really. [Eric] The minute I got into that band I joined a working schedule I'd never seen before. We worked seven nights a week. We played every night. The Twisted Wheel in Manchester. The Mojo in Sheffield. The Boathouse in Nottingham. The Club a'Gogo in Newcastle. I still had no idea how you talk to girls. I was very shy. And then suddenly I was dating, picking up girls. It was like a girl in every gig. [John Mayall] Eric lived in Ripley and he didn't have transport. So it became a matter of convenience that he'd stay at our house. There was a spare room. So he moved in there. I had the family, you know, so he was living in the family house. So it was very suburban. The regular life with the mum and dad and three children. At night we did the gigs. [Eric] He was very cool. He had an incredible collection of records that I listened to all day long. For about a year, I just would put on records and play along with them. and I went at it. [tabla playing] A lot of my influences around that time weren't just guitar players, they were other singers and also Indian music. I listened to Bismillah Khan a lot. I wanted my guitar to sound like his reed instrument. [Indian music playing] [blues music playing] [Eric] One of the biggest influences on what I wanted to achieve with a guitar was Little Walter. The sound he made with the harmonica, playing through an amplifier. And it was thick and fat. Very melodic. I had been wandering into music shops in the west end of London. And plugging a guitar in. I'd try that guitar with that amp. And I found this amp way out in West London and it was perfect. It was an absolutely perfect sound. [amplifier hums] [ Steppin' Out ] [John] He showed up with that guitar and that amp and immediately people started to idolise what he was doing. And to certain extent that's what bugged him the most. He didn't want to be looked at and inspected. He just wanted to play the way he wanted to play and leave him alone. [ Steppin' Out continues] [interviewer] Now, from the time that you left The Yardbirds and joined up with John Mayall and company, your head seemed to change tremendously as far as your music was concerned. What kind of things were happening to your head then? Well, I really didn't change as much as you probably think because it's not really, you know, an individual change. It was just put into a different context. So, I mean, the things that I was doing reflected differently, you know. I mean the... The context of The Yardbirds as opposed to John Mayall is totally different. One is pop and one is... Was then even more earthier blues than it is now. Stuff you played then. And you know, I just played the same things but they just sounded different. [man] Take three. [blues music playing] [Eric] We had been on the road for long enough to go in and just play our set. But at that period there were technicians doing the recording that just came up to your amp with a microphone, stuck it two inches away from the front of the amplifier. It seemed to me that if you wanted to get the atmosphere that we were getting in the clubs, you needed for it to sound like you were in the audience. Ten feet away. Not three inches. And so when the guy did that on that day that we went in to record, I said, "Excuse me, I don't want it there." "Put it over there." He said, " Well, you're making our job really difficult." And I said, "I don't care, that's the way I want it." [blues guitar playing] With Eric playing at the sort of volume he was playing, there was no way that anyone could deal with it. They didn't know what to do. So we had to find a way to deal with it. That was the most exciting part of the project because when we found how to do it, we had the sound. [ All Your Love playing] [Roger Waters] That changed everything. Before Eric, guitar playing in England had been Hank Marvin and The Shadows. Very, very simple, not much technique. Suddenly we heard something that was completely different. The record sounded unlike anything that any of us had ever heard before, it was completely revolutionary. [interviewer] Eric, now that blues have started to emerge as a really very powerful force on the pop scene. And everyone's latching on to it even though they don't necessarily understand the music. Now, do you think this is a bad thing? No, because, you see, what will happen is that after a long time, they will become so well educated musically that they'll be able to dig spades singing the blues instead of having to take watered down imitations. They won't have to accept that any more because they'll be free thinking enough to be able to look at a coloured man and dig it without having any hang ups. You know? And then, you know, all the white guys are gonna have to find something their own to play, that is good enough to stand up to it because they won't be accepted, they'll be rejected. There won't be any white blues bands, it couldn't happen. What is it you think about the music that draws young white kids to it? Now, you mentioned the fact that, uh, groups like The Rolling Stones have turned them on to the music. I think white kids really love a beautiful sound. That deep tone. Then even white kids sing the blues. They can play more blues than I can ever dream of playing. But you know, they'll never be able to vocal like me, you know that. And I'm singing that out to the church and got that big tone, I guess that's what the white kids come to see me for often. Does it have something to do with the feeling that... That's what I'm saying, that tone is the feeling, you got the feeling in there, for those kids. And there's no way you can counterfeit that? You can't counterfeit that. You mean, in other words... The young kids can learn to play a guitar that way but they can't learn to sing that way? Like me? -You mean, white kids? -Yeah. Oh, no. -You know better than that. -Why is that? They ain't got enough soul and they didn't have enough hard times. [chuckles] [Hughie Flint] I came around to Jones' house one day and he'd been out in the garden reading The Melody Maker and he was furious. And he said, "Eric's rehearsing with a band "in some church." And I said, "Oh, is he?" All of a sudden, there it was. There was this new group that's gonna be making its debut somewhere and that was it. It was very sudden. Total lunatic. Just said he's gonna quit.

He used to come around to the flat a lot and stay there. We had a great time really. He was so shy, and quiet, withdrawn and gentle. We talk about every day kind of ambitions, you know? And the way we want the world to be but the conversation never stayed that way for very long. 'Cause Jimi had such a surreal mind. Once you start going talking about anything. You'd end up talking about flying saucers, you know? Sort of purple velvet moons. [laughs] It's like. And you couldn't keep him on the ground for any length of time. [Jimi speaking] [Eric speaking] [indistinct chatter] [Ben] Eric came to my house in Oxford with Ginger and said he was forming Cream and would I like to go and work for them. I think he wanted somebody around who he knew. He was enjoying the new fruits of success hugely and the psychedelic musical venture that was happening. [Ahmet Ertegun] Eric and Cream came to New York and they came to record in our studio. They played songs that are not absolutely in a 12 or eight bar form but have a blues feel. It's a new music. Especially when Eric played the guitar. [ Hey Joe playing] [Tom Dowd] When I walked into my studio, I had a bunch of English roadies setting up double stacks of Marshalls and double bass drums and double cymbal stands and so I just looked and I thought, "What, have I got two of everything?"

And I said, "Oof, would I? You kidding?" -Okay. -Standby. [Eric] I looked in and there was Joe South, Bobby Hinton, Bobby Womack. There were like five guitar players on the floor and Aretha on piano, singing. And I went in there with my permed hair and pink trousers, high-heeled boots.

When I met Eric, I didn't know who he was at all. He was a bit shy, he was a bit inhibited at first. But then we started going out together. And we pretty much moved in together very quickly. [Eric] Charlotte was very funny and very, very open minded. We had a friendship. We just were comfortable together. She saw who I was for better or worse.

Because until the days of rock 'n' roll a lot of times, a lot of the places, we... They just wouldn't accept us. I'm not speaking racially, I'm just talking about the people at home that just wouldn't accept us in some of the places that... The door's open now, that you can go into. [Crossroads continues] [Bill Graham] B.B King played the joints for years. Otis Redding was a black R&B singer who played the southern route. And what rock n' roll or the popularity of rock n' roll has afforded us is the opportunity to use good rock n' roll as bait to bring the people in, but once they got it, present them with uh... some of the people who, were it not for them, there wouldn't be any rock n' roll. [B.B King] I was playing in New York City and I've been hearing about this young guitarist, the Cream and so on. I met this young man. Long hair and very quiet like. We had a jam session. Eric seemed to take time, it's like putting pieces in a puzzle. Like an old seasoned guy. It could sound good, but if you gonna play more than two or three notes, you need to have a story to tell. And he told me some very good ones. White America had never paid attention to blues. So thanks to Eric, really, it awakened. Started them listening. Now a lot of doors were opened for B.B. King and many other people like myself. [Crossroads continues] [Ahmet] They did like 300 shows a year. And had a huge, huge following based on their live performances. So at that time, Cream got to be the biggest band in the world. Much bigger than the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. [music ends] [audience cheering] [Jack] Eric Clapton, please. [interviewer] When you're improvising, do you use stock phrases? Um, yeah, there are always phrases that I always play that are stock phrases that I work from you know, which are just like... All these runs. You know, I've put together from old phrases that I've first started on like... [plays guitar slowly] And then they're just kind of messed up with other things which I've learned like... If a guy likes playing football, then that's what he'll use to get... To get all of his, kind of, basic... Kind of, angry bits out of him, you know, that you build up through any day. You can just, someone is tooting the horn in the car behind you and you'll get angry and you have no release for it, you know? Well, that happens to everybody, but you know, I've got the advantage of being able to sort of play that out on the guitar. By being sort of, um, fairly aggressive in the way I'm playing, not the way I use it. That can be done too with people like The Who. Can you show us? What you mean, you want me to break the guitar up? Well, no, not quite, just an example -of aggression in your music. -Yeah, right. [plays blues guitar] [Charlotte] Eric wasn't the best communicator. There was a lot of unsaid things, you know, about where he was at. He enjoyed part of it very much. There was an aspect of being adored. But it was difficult to keep up. And to be on tour for months and months. There was constant, serious dispute between Jack and Ginger every day. It didn't matter to them what they were arguing about really. It was just, they were at each other's throats and it was very intense. We shut one another out, I mean I would just run away from him, we never socialized. We never really shared ideas any more, we just got together on stage and played and then went our different ways. The whole thing was awful. [sombre music playing] [indistinct chatter] [guitar playing] [Charlotte] Eric was picking up his guitar at home. and twanging on it non-stop. Which is not always the easiest thing when you're trying to have a conversation with somebody. I remember finding myself talking and I would get a riff from the guitar back, rather than proper communication. It was very hard to keep up on an emotional, personal level. You know, I'm in love with Eric. And then the world's in love with him. We just didn't talk about feelings. Eric just wouldn't go there. I always felt he was running away from something. He started going to George and Pattie's quite a lot when they lived in Surrey. When Cream broke up, I think spiritually, he was really rather bereft. And he enjoyed hanging out and played guitar and started writing all day. [John Lennon] Yes? [Engineer] Start again. -[cymbal crashes] -[John] Okay. George said, "I'm going to do this song, "I want you to play the guitar." How we doing, Hal? [Eric] We did maybe two or three takes, and there was a very few attempts at the song. [John] Yes? Just start again. They were fast and furious, they were harsh judges.

Now, Eric had a house in Newhurst which is just beyond Esher. So it's quite easy for the two of them to go to each other's houses. [Charlotte] And it was just like a really nice friendship going on. George had a lot of respect for Eric's guitar playing. It was just four friends. [Pattie] We'd hang out together and we'd go to the restaurants and bars. He used to come over to the house quite a lot. Not always to see George. I think as time went on. You know how some people have that stare that's longer than it should be? And I caught a couple of those. [Eric] I knew it was wrong. George was my best friend. But I felt a compulsion towards her. That she was probably the most desirable woman I had ever met. And even though, they were married, I wanted her. Even though she was unavailable and that frightened me. [Pattie] I felt there was a big confusion in his head about women. And what they represented to him. It was so intense and he was so intense. [ship horn blaring] [Eric] When I was nine, my grandmother said to me. This lady's coming and she's your real mum and we're gonna go and meet her and she's gonna stay for a little while. She arrived by boat and we went to meet her at Southampton. She was on one of those big liners. She came with two kids. [Sylvia Clapton] Eric was very quiet that day. He's very shy. He wanted to see his real mum. And I think Rick was looking for love. [Eric] We got back to Ripley and then when everyone came down to get a cup of tea or whatever. I wanted to know the most important thing. "You're my mum, are you gonna be my mum?" And she said, "No. "I think it's best we leave it the way it is." [Sylvia] It was so cruel. She didn't like the fact he called her, "mum." I couldn't believe anybody could be so nasty. She brought her other son, Bryan and he said to 'Ric, "Are you my brother?" And she heard that, and she said, "No, he's not "your brother." I couldn't believe it, she could say things like that to a child. [Eric] I was so angry with her. I just felt rejection. I didn't talk to anybody. I was more on my own than I had ever been. [sombre music playing] [Presence of the Lord playing] [Steve Winwood] Eric felt that he wanted to try something a bit different musically and asked me if I'd be interested. We were essentially just experimenting. None of us more than Eric I think, he was definitely going through something. [Eric] We were just having fun, we hadn't got an agenda. I wrote a song called, Presence of the Lord which it starts out with the line, "I finally found a place to live." And I was really writing about Hurtwood. ♪ I have finally found a place to live ♪ ♪ Just like I never could before ♪ ♪ And I know I don't have much to give ♪ ♪ But I can open any door ♪ ♪ Everybody knows the secret ♪ ♪ Everybody knows the score yeah ♪ ♪ I have finally found a place to live ♪ ♪ In the presence of the Lord ♪ ♪ In the presence of the Lord ♪ [Eric] By now, Charlotte had had enough. We broke up and she'd gone back to Paris. And I had begun on and off to see this girl, Alice. She was a great woman. But she didn't know that I was obsessed with Pattie. ♪ Everybody knows the secret ♪ ♪ Everybody knows the score yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ I have finally found a way to live ♪ ♪ In the presence of the Lord ♪ ♪ In the presence of the Lord ♪ [audience cheering] [Pattie] One morning, I woke up and opening the mail, I found this letter with tiny little handwriting. And I opened it and it said, "Dearest L." The spacing of the words and the size of the lettering compared to the size of the page. It was quiet, but it was full of passion. I almost had a sort of physical reaction that somebody could write something so amazingly beautiful and yet keeping it quiet. It was bursting with passion. And later in the early evening, the phone rang and it was Eric. He said, "I mean what I say in the letter." [Bobby] The very first time I met Eric. We were opening up for Blind Faith. That band broke up, so I called up Eric and I just said, "I needed to get away, "and just to get quiet for a while." And he said, "Why don't you come over?" We just hung out and played and watched silly programs and stuff, you know? [Eric] I was offered a concert which was a benefit, you know? Wouldn't make any money, really, it was just a chance to play somewhere. Bobby and I thought, "Why don't we do that?" So we only did the rhythm section, but the only rhythm section we knew that we could work with was Jim and Carl. So we got Jim and Carl over. And I think that was the only thing we had planned. [rock music playing] [Bobby] It was all about just playing constantly. There was times when we jammed in E for like days. [Cathy] There was really no break from it, there was like a constant musical party. Everybody came over to visit. There was always a lot of cocaine. Lot of Mandrax, which is kind of like a quaalude. LSD, mescaline and a lot of pot, a lot of hash. I knew something was wrong with Eric, he wasn't himself, he was very distracted all the time. Whenever I saw Pattie, I saw him perk up a little bit. He had a lot of pictures of her around, like modelling pictures. I think that was even bigger than his music, because he seemed to be so obsessed. Eric started to phone me and said, "Come on. "You're obviously unhappy, come away with me." And I'd say, "No, I can't." You know, I'm married to George and he'll say, "Look, come on..." He was fun and awake and alive. It was the most wonderful temptation and I could only compare him to George who could be very cold and would just turn off. So from time to time, during the summer, Eric and I saw each other. We'd go to little places for coffee, lunch or even dinner. [Bobby] George Harrison rang one afternoon and he asked Eric, if he and I would like to play on his first album that he's gonna do. He had all these songs, you know? Eric and I had talked about who we wanted in the band. Of course we knew, we wanted Carl. And Jim Gordon just storm trooped over and we were ready to go, we couldn't wait. You know, because it was to go into the studio and record All Things Must Pass. So, really, we put the band together during the All Things Must Pass sessions. [My Sweet Lord playing] [Eric] That was our first recording, it was All Things Must Pass. It was the first Dominos real recording. But that's when the drugs were coming in. This guy would show up at Abbey Road and sell you your coke but he'd make sure that you bought smack as well. That was the deal, he wouldn't sell you one without the other. ♪ Really want to see you ♪ [Bobby] Eric says, "You wanna try some of this? You know, the heroin. I said, "No, man, let me just watch you." He did it. Just snorted it, you know? I said, "What does it feel like?" He said, "Pink cotton wool surrounding me." [Eric] Then I went in to a sort of trance. It got really mysterious and I didn't know where I was. I had been given a little Persian book. The love story about Laila and Majnun. An absolute tragedy of doomed love. The hero ends up alone in the desert and gives his soul up to Allah before dying alone. I saw myself as that. I saw the whole experience with Pattie as tragedy. [Pattie] Things became rather tricky with George and I. I met with Eric, we had a drink in South Kensington, he had a flat there. Eric said, "You know, I love you and I want you "to be with me, come away with me. "I just feel that I need you." [Eric] We'd been flirting for quite a while. But we hadn't gone over the line. But that evening. We made love. And then we realized that we were supposed to be at this party. [Cathy James] Everybody was there. It was a big party. I went with Mick. Paul McCartney was there, Eric was there. Pattie came without George. [Eric] For the first time, it felt like there was a chance for us. [Pattie] Eric said he wanted to talk to me and we were in the garden. This was quite late, you know, because the sun was beginning to come up. And George appeared from nowhere from the mists of the morning. [Eric] And I said, "I have to tell you something, "I'm in love with your wife." [Pattie] And George looked at me accusingly and said, "Well, what are you gonna do, are you going with him "or are you coming back with me?" [Eric] I felt her detach. Right there and then, I knew the deal was off. [Pattie] So I said, "George, of course I'm going with you." There were no extra words, there was nothing else to be discussed except who was I going home with and I found that deeply depressing. [Eric] Everyone knew that George was playing around but she was absolutely loyal to him. And I thought, "What do you want? "Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?" What do I have to do?

We set up in Thunderbird motel down there, with very large bags of cocaine. We really didn't have enough songs for an album. But we had faith. Played all day, played all night. Get back to hotel, hole up in Eric's room or something and playing that thing. [blues guitar playing] [engineer] Once more, once more, once more. Sorry. [blues guitar playing] [Tom] They started playing me concepts for songs that they had not finalized the arrangements on and I just kept tape rolling for a day or two, because I was learning the songs as they were playing them and the songs and the arrangements were evolving. [Eric] I can't do it. When it gets a little more complicated than a simple harmony, I'm not sure if I could. [Bobby] What if I started out and did the first... [Eric] And the guitar? [indistinct conversation] [ Bell Bottom Blues playing] [Tom speaking] [Eric speaking] [Eric] About two weeks into the sessions, we hit a brick wall. We got stuck, really badly stuck. I'd written part of the song in England. For Pattie. It had this sort of story overlaid on him about a little Persian book. Laila and Majnum. And I couldn't finish it. What will you do when you get lonely? ♪ And nobody's waiting by your side ♪ ♪ You've been running and hiding much too long ♪ ♪ You know it's just your foolish pride ♪ [Bobby] That was for sure, a tortured soul singing right there. But things were getting complicated. The band really needed a new direction. [ Dreams playing] [Eric] Tom Dowd took us all to see the Allman Brothers. And I was completely blown away by this band and they just were incredible musicians. [Tom] Eric had never met Duane. He heard about Duane, but Duane and I were already tight. It was Duane's show, he ran that band, he was the band leader. That was it. After the show, we asked him to come back and we jammed all night long. [Duane Allman speaking] [Layla playing] ♪ I've tried to give you consolation ♪ ♪ When your old man had let you down ♪ ♪ Like a fool I fell in love with you ♪ ♪ Turned my whole world upside down ♪ ♪ Layla ♪ ♪ Got me on my knees Layla ♪ ♪ I'm begging, darling, please Layla ♪ ♪ Darling won't you ease my worried mind ♪ [Duane] Hands are dead! [Duane speaking] [Eric] Duane and I just became inseparable for the rest of the time we were there. He was the catalyst we needed. [Bobby] It was all about love songs. Ballads with a different tempo. It was that what we can't see or touch or smell, or taste or feel. And of course, it was all about Pattie. That's why Eric is singing all that pain and agony and stuff. [Pattie] I met with Eric in South Kensington he said, "I've got something for you to hear." ♪ Bell bottom blues you made me cry ♪ He played me this album. My gosh, it was so powerful. ♪ If I could choose ♪ ♪ A place to die ♪ ♪ It would be in your arms ♪ ♪ Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you? ♪ I was at bursting point of emotion. I couldn't believe that I was the inspiration for him putting this together. I thought when I heard it, that everyone would know it was about me. ♪ Give me one more day please ♪ ♪ I don't want to fade away ♪ And I didn't want this to happen. I couldn't stop listening to it. But once the album was finished, I couldn't wait to get out and go home. [ Layla playing] [Eric] It didn't work. It was all for nothing. It was like a... Rejection. The Jimi Hendrix Experience is over. The acid rock musician died today in a London hospital apparently from an overdose of drugs. During his short career, Hendrix flailed his electric guitar into some of the most unusual sounds of an unusual music. [Eric] I went out into the garden and cried all day. 'Cause he left me behind. And not because he's gone, but because he hadn't taken me with him. This made me so fucking angry. [Bobby] Well, it shattered Eric, you know? We had just recorded Little Wing couple of weeks before that. That was Eric's tribute to Jimi. So that had a huge impact on Eric. Morning, spot me on the Bee Gees and the other one. Excellent. You hear the new mix down there. Eric, you're... That Derek, they oughta be a smash hit. I'm telling you, it's a mass... Dill Besta, Greenbert. Jerry... All right, yeah. Derek and the Dominos, 25 for cash box and 24 for record. I considered Eric the most major artist on our label. So I couldn't believe the record wasn't selling in America. I didn't know what to do. And he knew, it was because nobody knew that Derek was Eric. So, at that time, Eric was very vulnerable. Why not call the group... by your name? Everybody knows... that Derek and the Dominos are Eric Clapton, you know what I mean? [Eric] But then, what's the difference? [Howard] But, why, why not? [Eric] Well, because... I guess it's just more fun to have a name, you know... It's just lighter, you know? [Howard] I read something about the idea that you wanna give up touring, you're not considering giving it all up? [Eric] I don't think I could ever stop playing. You know, like I could vanish anytime, I could just stop making appearances at anytime. I think I could, that's quite easy. You know, financially if I was secure enough to able to not have to go on the road which I'm not at the moment, I need to go out to make money to exist. If I didn't need to do that, as long as I had someone around me to play with, you know, I could probably just stay at home all the time. [audience cheering] [sombre music playing] [Eric] I feel much more alone these days. You know and if I'm alone, I'll cry. You know, literally just weep. What I want most is out. You know, out of everything. Because, right now, all I can see is the suffering of today and the suffering of tomorrow. [Steve speaking] [Eric] It comes first. -[Steve speaking] -[Eric] Yeah. It's like surrounding yourself in pink cotton wool, you know? Nothing bothers you, whatsoever, man. Nothing will faze you out, in any way. I also have this death wish. [Steve speaking] I don't like life. [Steve speaking] No. And I'm not gonna live very long. [Bobby] Eric went into seclusion. He turned and walked away, without us. And he got off into the heroin. And I was gonna stay there and wait it out. But it didn't seem like it was ever gonna happen. I thought it was the beginning. I didn't know it was the end. [sombre violin music playing] [Ben] I was in Wales at the time, and I went down to Hurtwood where he lived. I didn't know anything about heroin addiction. I just thought because I was one of his oldest friends, if not his oldest friend. There just might be something we could talk about. And I saw him moving past the window upstairs in the house. But the house was locked. And nobody had responded to me ringing the bell, knocking the door. In the end, I figured, "He doesn't want to see you," and I left him alone. [haunting music playing] I didn't see him for a long time. And I thought to myself, given his family history so far, this is going to be very difficult for him to get through. There are things you don't get over. You have to find a comfortable place to put them. But they're always there. [plane engine revving] With '74 tour, we started Scandinavia at first, just as a warm up. He was fragile, I'm not sure whether he was really aware of everything around him. What was going on around him. [Eric] I managed to come off heroin. But I just went from one addiction to another. And the attitude back then was that alcohol was okay. But for me, alcohol was far more dangerous than heroin. [indistinct announcement] [Howard] Whether it be record label forcing him, management forcing him, may have been a little too quick going on a huge tour like that, and throwing him back into the public limelight after being a hermit through the past four or five years. [audience cheering] I'll drink to that. [George] Eric discovered Gevassier and Remy Martin and just went into it. if he got a hold of something, he'd hit at it until it was gone. And before you know it, he'd be through a whole bottle of cognac before lunch time's over. It looked like he wanted to kill himself. [audience cheering] [Eric slurring] [crowd booing] [man shouting] Some shows, he played 30 minutes and say, "I'm done." You know the contract may have said an hour and a half. But you also have 25,000, 30,000 people that have... Get a little upset... [laughs] That you just left. [Eric] [slurring] Sit down and shut up! It was still legal to throw bottles and coolers and can openers and whatever you want to throw up there, you could throw. You'll think your life is in jeopardy. [Eric] Jamie Oldaker! Ah. Smile, you cunt! [marching music playing] [Eric] The first disappointing confrontation with my mother was when I was nine. I learned how to recover from that over the next few years. Becoming good at art and developing a strong interest in music. By then I'd kind of developed a personal look. [children laughing] [Rose speaking] [Eric] I had my guitar and that was my total companion in its little case. And then there came this invitation to go to Germany, because Pat's husband had been stationed there with the Canadian Air Force. He came over to visit us in Germany and he was just so keen on the guitar. And we said, if he wanted to bring the guitar with him to practice, he could. Because really and truly, like everybody else, we didn't take it seriously. [Eric] We're on an army camp and I didn't fit. And it was suggested to me that I should get a hair cut. I said, "I'd rather not, I like my hair the way it is." My mother put on this face like, "Dare to defy me." And I thought, "I don't like you. "You don't want me anyway. "And now you really don't want me the way I am." Rose said, "Please, do this." Just to keep everybody happy. So they gave me a crew cut. It made me cry. And a couple of days later, my brother came in, my half brother and sat on the guitar and broke the neck clean in half. It was like, everything was done to demolish my personality and make me null and void. I was full of hatred, anger and resentment. So I thought, "Okay. "That's the last time I trust anyone." Things became very difficult with George and I, and we decided it would be better if we parted. I heard that Eric was on a tour. I went to surprise him. Our relationship hadn't been completed. There was clearly more to it than just snatched meetings. [Eric] I hadn't seen her for all those years. Pattie must have known she was getting involved with someone who was pretty unstable. As much as I could love someone, I loved her. I was not just screwed up, but you know, a full blown addict by then. Maybe I never got beyond just wanting her from a distance. [Pattie] We would do all sorts of things together and he would say, he loves me. But he wanted to drink all the time and it just increased. But then when he had too much to drink or became really seriously unpleasant and I felt that he didn't love me either. So this was really ghastly until maybe the next day and he'd be loving again. He was quite scary, and he would scream at me across hotel lobbies. He was just listening to a different drummer when he was that drunk. [Eric] Mind if I have a drink? [man speaking] Tell you what, you want to come on stage and talk, you want to come up here and talk about it? I'll fucking have you, I'll tell ya. [Jamie] It got to be a point of wondering, you know, each show, what's going to happen tomorrow night? And I used to ask Carl, "What's up with this guy? "They told me he was a nice guy." You know, I have to lock my doors every night and hide from this guy, 'cause he's out of his mind. [rock music playing] [music slowing down] [Eric] When I realized what I said, I just was so disgusted with myself. I was so fucking angry. And I thought I needed to apologize to the people I said that to. Because it was so shocking and unforgivable and I was so ashamed of who I was. I was becoming not only chauvinistic but fascistic too. I was a kind of a semi racist which didn't make sense. I mean, half of my friends were black. I dated black women and listened to black music and championed black music. But it didn't matter at all. They could have all gone to the wall as long as I had the bottle. I hated everything. Everything. I thought I had this dream, you know? About the perfect band, you know? I the... And the virtuoso of each instrument, you know? I thought I was a virtuoso. My instrument, thought Jack and Ginger was the virtuoso and, uh, we all thought that. I'm sad that it actually ever happen, really. Because... I mean, I wouldn't want to change anything but probably would've done better to stay with John Mayall and then because, it was that Cream thing, it was all like... It was just aggressive music. [snorting] It's not even worth it, is it? Just fucking do it. She's got another stash. [Pattie] Eric was a very sad person. Very, very sad. He was a broken man who can't cope, who can hardly speak. He started having seizures and then the doctor told me, unless he stopped drinking, he would die. [sombre music playing] [Eric] The only reason I didn't commit suicide was the fact that I wouldn't be able to drink any more if I was dead. My capacity for the love of alcohol was boundless. So I drank and drank and drank. Again and again and again. When making records during the drunken period. I personally find it difficult to listen to, because I can hear how drunk I am. All of these albums have, elements where it's moved up a notch and I've been given the chance to sing and play in a way that I hadn't before. [audience cheering] I went off to Moscow, a lot of things took place while I was there. I ended up having an affair with the studio manageress, George Martin's Air Studios in Montserrat. A lovely woman called Yvonne, very attractive lady, very funny, very witty. And I got a letter from her saying she was pregnant with a daughter and that she didn't have any expectations from me, she was going to try and raise the child in her existing marriage. And I knew I just wasn't capable of having a relationship. ♪ When, when ♪ Okay, let's just do it more acapella.

Am I gonna remember that? Well, you wrote it. [Eric] I was in absolute denial about my alcoholism. I had gone to the best treatment centre in the world but I got into dope again and alcohol and blow. And I was trying to hide it from everybody. Some people say you have to live the blues to sing the blues. During that period of time in your life where you were involved with drugs and alcohol, did you do that to justify that point of view? No, you know, I was just a party animal. A fun seeking boy. And then I was in Milan, touring and a promoter then she introduced me to Lory Del Santo. I was just smitten with her and decided I'm going to start my life from scratch here in Italy without any idea where it was going to go. [Pattie] He was a complete asshole. There was no relationship, and I knew it wouldn't work. And I felt so sad that he and I split up because of that ridiculous idea. But he was a sick person and he obviously believed it. [Eric] We tried to make a go of it. But she didn't know who she was dealing with, I was not grounded in any way. I said, "Well, look, I don't think this is working. "I want to go back to my wife." And she told me, "Well, that's not really "good news, because I'm pregnant." Mmm. Conor was the first thing that happened to me in my entire life that really got to my core and told me, time to grow up. Strong man. I could not fuck around any longer. I could not damage this. Up. Catch that. [making cooing noises] [reporter speaking] Well that came about quite out of the blue. I met this young lady and bang it happened. It was like the baby was looking for parents too. You know, to give it life. And he's great, it's wonderful. Yes, just you know, grow up happily with my son. I got to the place where I couldn't live without a drink and I couldn't live with it. When I tried to stop on my own, my withdrawals were so hard that I had a grand mal seizure. I was on my own in the house one day. And I got down on my knees and prayed. Was a really clumsy experience but it was born out of real desperation. And I said, "Just let me have some peace." [reporter] What effect has fatherhood had on you? [Eric] A very stabilizing effect because you suddenly have to stop being so selfish, you know? You have to think more about the life of someone else. It is like a blood thing. It's a tie for the rest of your life. And I love him dearly and really he's made a massive change in me. [audience cheering] Lory and Conor were staying in New York in this place called the Galleria on 57th street. And I was in New York as well. So I took Conor to see the circus on Long Island. We had a great time. The following day, I was going to take Conor for lunch maybe on my own. It was about eleven in the morning. I was getting ready to go up to 57th Street. Then I got a phone call from Lory, just kind of screaming. She said, "He's dead." I thought, "What's she talking about?" She said, "He fell out the window." [reporter] There couldn't have been a bigger nightmare. Before anyone could stop him, four-year-old Conor Clapton had plunged to his death from the 53rd floor of the Galleria building. He made it past his mother and three other adults who were in the apartment to a window that had just been cleaned and left open. There was nothing to break his fall except the roof of an adjoining building. It's just a tragic accident, that the child apparently wandered into... Into the bedroom, wandered close to the window and just by the fact that the window ledge was low. It appears that he just tragically fell out. [Eric] I felt like I stepped back out of myself. I couldn't grasp it, I could not grasp it. And I went with the body down to the nearest hospital. I went to see him and I said goodbye to him. And I did lose faith. [Pattie] It was horrific. I just couldn't think about that little boy. This little soul. Eric was a fighter. But I know that as well as myself, a lot of his friends were very concerned about him, his sobriety, he was on his own. [Eric] Italians had gone home and Hurtwood was quiet and it was just me there. With my thoughts. I started opening all my letters of condolence. Thousands and thousands of them. I opened one and it was from Conor. And it had been posted weeks before from Milan. And I realized if I can go through this and stay sober then anyone can. And I suddenly became aware of the fact that there was a way to turn this dreadful tragedy into something positive. That I would consider living my life from this point on to honour the memory of my son. [acoustic guitar playing] I got hold of the little Spanish guitar that I had lying around. And I had it with me the whole time. From the minute I woke up. And for the rest of that year, I just played and played to stop from facing this situation.

[audience applauding] Thank you. Finally, me and my daughter, Ruth were able to begin our own relationship, which was wonderful. And it took me to a place where I was able to have a great relationship with Ruth and also become available to have a relationship with another human being, Now see that's, that was the first time I felt like that in my entire life. [Larry King] I have a brochure to show you quickly called Crossroads centre at Antigua. But this... This is an Eric Clapton project, what is it? For the last three years, I've been trying to start a treatment centre in Antigua. For addiction? For addiction to drugs and alcohol, yeah. So are you doing it for people who live on the island? I'm primarily doing it for people that have no money. That need treatment. There's 100 guitars here, some of them were with me through some really extreme times. But I want them to raise a lot of money for the foundation and to carry the message of the centre. [auctioneer] Five hundred thousand out there. Six hundred thousand I'm offered. 700,000, 800,000. Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And sold. [Eric] Music has given me a great life. That's never betrayed me, it's never gonna let me down. But if it doesn't have the same value as knowing that there are people out there that I've helped get sober through the treatment centre. [audience cheering] [Robert Cray] Let's bring on Hubert Sumlin. Please welcome Buddy Guy. Put your hands together for the king of the blues. B.B. King. [Ben] If he hadn't heard and liked the blues. He could just about about retiring from the building trade now. Having spent his life, laying tiles like his father. If you guide yourself into the worst aspects of life which he undoubtedly did. Nobody pushed him down to the depth that he felt he reached at several points. And nobody has got him out. Now, I mean that is a very powerful personality. It doesn't necessarily have to show itself in company. But it must be there for him to have survived. [Eric] And then I met Melia and fell in love. She's everything I ever wanted. She's my soul mate. She's a beautiful woman, she's a great friend. And she's a fantastic mother. What more could a man ever want? Hello, this is Sophie. Here she is. And this is Daddy. And this is Ella. Here is Mommy. And here is me. Hi. [all screaming] [Eric] It's everything I did and all the mistakes I made and everything that brought me here. And it couldn't me much better, really. I finally found the family I always wanted. And always needed. And now here they are, and I'm one of them. My life is completely full. And I would like to say a toast to the Boss. Give me a little talking music, will you? Robert, please. Keep it down, keep it down. Ladies and gentlemen, for you, I know that you know that Eric is a great artist. He flew all the way to California to make my first CD. Not only did he do that, he's done so many things for a lot of us, including this guy. So I'd like you to know... I'm gonna shut up in a minute, but I'd like you to know. That I've been around the world, I've played 90 different countries around the world, and I've met many people, kings and queens. But I've never met a better man, a more gracious man than my friend, I like to call him my friend, Eric Clapton. [audience cheering] So I say to all of you... May I live forever... But may you live forever and a day. 'Cause I'd hate to be here when you pass away. And when they lay me out to rest... As I mentioned, I'm 81 now. When they lay me out to rest, may the last voices I hear be yours. Saying while we was alive we was friends.
