There he is. The one and only. What's happening? Rico "Hollywood" Roman. - How's it going? - Our big celebrity. - Entrepreneur. - Yep. Videographer. What's going on? What do you think about this project? What are your thoughts? - Uh, I'm... - 2,000 Miles - From Hollywood, redux. - Yep. 1,000 Miles Closer is tentative title. I'm excited for it; I'm executive producing. What does that mean, exactly? Uh, I'm gonna be helping out and providing some of the sound and lighting, because... Some stuff over here... This guy's on a tight budget, so I wanna help him make the product overall more professional. The only thing that's not professional about this product is the camera he's using because the DSLR, - Okay... - You shouldn't shoot. If you want a professional video done with a video camera, Wow, shameless plug. In a documentary about somebody else. That's embarassing. So say what we just said. You just talk... What do you want me to say? We just talked about it! This is my girlfriend for four years. She's a great person, up and down. Stop. Creep. And she will be executive producing the movie along with my brother, who you've already met. And why don't you just explain, this is kind of behind the scenes stuff for the documentary extras, what exactly you're doing? Okay, so... Besides being eye candy. Not at all. Okay, so I'm executive producer. I am the one that kind of gets schedules together between Cordero and Luke, because with Luke being a farmer it's not easy, you know, he doesn't have a lot of free time, and time to just relax or do anything, so I kinda get all that together. And then once the documentary is done, I will be, kinda be just promoting it, telling about it through, like, social media, and just like, talking to people. Sweet. On a scale of one to pumped, how pumped are you? Super pumped. Great. Why are you filming me? Shouldn't you be filming Luke? Well... You're gonna run out of tape. Actually, I'll have you know that DSLRs do not run on tape, they run on SD cards. So I can just delete this at my own discretion. Plus, it's like... Aren't you special? You know, it's not all just documentary shit. Yeah, it is. It's just life in general here in Wisconsin, because, you know, one day we'll look back and say, "This is what we were doing when we were 21 years old," "the summer of 2012." All right, say bye. See ya! Rise and shine, little boy. Are you serious? You wanna just sleep all day? Time to make it to the big screen. I suppose. This is what movie stars do, right? They get up at like, fucking, 1 o'clock in the afternoon? Yep. All right, I'll let you go to hair and make-up for the next five hours, then we'll start filming. All right, so we got Luke Rohl here, the talent. He's scanning a very official document, here. Letter for letter. The release form that says, "in the event of anything that should happen," I'm okay, I'm not liable. So why don't you go ahead and sign it so we got it on camera, that way you can't lie to me and say... Here, let me get a shot of that. "I, scribble scribble," I'm not there yet. "Will not sue the filmmaker, Cordero Roman, "for anything that should occur "while creating this documentary. "He is awesome and does not deserve" "a lawsuit on his plate." That about sums it up. That's about as professional as it gets, right there. Okay. All right, let's do it! There she is. America's heartland. That's right. How's it feel to have a camera in your face at all times, again? Does it bring you back to last year? Gives me a boner. And memories of last year, that was fun, too. Are those related? The boner and memories of last year? Yeah, you're hot. Ladies and gentlemen, I just wanna clarify. Um... Put a little brightness up. Just wanna clarify if there's any wind, sound problems, rack focus, stupid focus problems, that's all my fault. I am indeed an amateur filmmaker, and I wouldn't even consider myself a filmmaker. I shelled out $1200 for the equipment, and got a mic, this camera, shoulder rig, stuff like that, so you gotta work with what you got, so... Wait, wait, wait, wait. $1200 for that, - Yes. And you're going ahead and spending $55,000 learning how to be a screenwriter? A guy that makes movies? You know what I'm saying, writing movies and making them are two different things, so, - I mean... - Well yeah, apples to oranges, I'm a fan of potatoes. Let's keep going, here. Come here, Ronnie, I wanna talk. Since July you've been calling at midnight, Ronnie. Don't, Ronnie, don't run. Ronnie? Ronnie! Ronnie... Ronnie! Ronnie! Why don't you, uh... Have a beer? A huge, huge-ass Brewskey? Yeah. Bottoms up. All right, so why don't you explain, first off, high production value, right there. Yeah, this... I'll tell ya... Once again nothing changed from last year, just like the fucking popcorn tin. Except now we're using construction lighting. You look good. But it all works. It all works. - You look good. - I do look good. I do look good. All right, so, explain to the audience where we are, now. This would be basically the first doorway into my home. It's the porch where I keep all my barn clothes, different stuff, all kinds of outdoor clothes, basically. Yep. It's a nice little array, you got there. Very, very hillbillyish. What do we got, here? You wanna turn on the light? Of course, this is... Excuse me, big old beer getting to me. This is bathroom, that's all my girlfriend's stuff. She is out of town right now. She doesn't live here, though, right? Not yet. Hopefully. But she's out of town, right now. So it's just you? Yep, just me. Here we have basement. It's uh... just... your average basement, except it's creepy, dark, lots of... So your average basement. It's an average basement. What's down there, anything of importance? Uh, just... DVDs, old books, stuff that should be in a storage unit. But it's down there. The door always remains locked, too, so. And it's always dark, very scary, and big, big fucking spiders. I'll drink to that. Right. Kitchen area. Kitchen, of course. You showed up here, made me forget to put away my supper. - Beans? - Yeah. Not bad. Hobo delight. Anyhoosers. This is the living room... Living room. Oh, and of course, you gotta remember these, right here. - Cheese balls. - Cheese balls. - Record is... - Record is... Record is a day and a half with one of them. Dear God. Oh, not "dear God." Dear... What's this? The fuck was that? Was that a knock? Sounded uh, I don't know. Nobody's here. It's probably like a cat. A cat that knocks. I don't know. It probably wasn't a... The door's open. Was that door not shut behind me? Well, I thought that, I could check, oh shit, here. - Oh. - This light was... Our light was on. - Ow. - What the fuck? There's nobody out here. And our yard light came back on, I'd be able to see them from here clear to the barn, now. Yeah, I don't see anything. That's fucking weird. Yeah. Do you get visitors out here, often, or what? No, dude, this is the... The prostitute? This is the... Your prostitute's not coming tonight? - Son... - No pun intended. Fucking A, right? Let's just go ahead with the tour. All right, let's see, where were we? Let's close this door this time. If you can, explain... uh, kinda what happened the last couple years. Just... Well, I guess, either you can explain it or you can film the dates on the headstone. What do you think they think about you being away from the farm, making movies with a kid from, kid out in California? Uh... I'm sure Mom would probably think, "Oh, that's good, honey." And Dad would go ahead and tell me to get back down to the barn. That's about how it probably would go. Mom, Dad, love you. See you in a couple more weeks, yet. I know you're not going too far. What do you get when you cross a female deer and a pickle? A dill doe. ♫ As you go down, down deeper ♫ the bell's ringing louder, the devil ♫ he speaks to you, he wants you to come, closer ♫ Don't know that one. I just kinda thought of it. You got some serious issues, man. Right? Tell ya. Farming by yourself gets to you. All right, so, what's your name? Kailey. And what's your relation to Luke? He's my uncle. Okay, and if you could describe him in one word, what would it be? I don't know, I guess he's funny, I guess. All right, funny. That's a good one, I would use that. And what's your favorite memory of Luke? What's one moment that made you laugh? Oh. One time when me and Mikey were little, he pretended to be a zombie and he chased us around. That sounds awful. It was funny, though. That is pretty funny. Yeah, it was kinda scary, though. Luke's a good guy. Yeah. He was crawling around the floor one day, and he grabbed ahold of the table leg and he pulled himself up and he's in his Pampers. And he'd always grab onto the table and he'd swing. He'd hang onto the table, he'd get swinging back and forth, and one day his hands slipped and he landed right flat on his ass on the floor. Luke Rohl. Luke Rohl, ladies and gentlemen. Look what he turned into, today. - Yeah. - A gem. With a capital G. A gem fucking polished from a... lump of coal. I'm gonna grab a beer. This is crazy, you and that camera... How do they do it in Hollywood? "Cut!" "Cut," yeah. All right, if you could explain the role of your family in your personal and occupational lives in the last year or so? Well, you know, personal life... My family's been coming over very, I'd say, pretty consistently, you know. They've come over, they have supper with me, and they bring supper over and just have a good time. Holy Spirit. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts that we are about to receive through the bounty of Christ, our Lord, Amen. Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, Our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. In the name of the father and son, and the holy spirit. Thank you for leading us. Finally! Cordero? Yes, Lucas? Why the fuck are you filming me right now? It's a documentary. You gotta get every aspect of life. Typical Tuesday night for Lucas Rohl. Fucking cheese balls and YouTube. Hey, man, that's just part of life. Right. Not everything's, you know, an adventure. Mmhmm. What are you looking at? What're you looking at on YouTube? Nothing. Nothing at all. Nothing. Nothing at all. Dramatic close of the computer. Yeah, fucking right, dramatic. - I'm my own person. - Porn? Porn right in front of me. Jesus, man, what's wrong with you? It was YouTube. What the fuck? Wait a minute, wait, wait. What? What? I don't know. It just, I swear to God, that was like... DÃ©jÃ fucking vu? DÃ©jÃ vu, yeah. What is it? - Nothing, that's it. - Fuck. Are you kidding me? Door's open, again. Jeez, I got fucking goosebumps. Goosebumps? Yeah, this fucking, this... This is bullshit. Well, - Whoa, whoa, - did you... - Wait, what? What? What? Did you do this, ag... - Are you trying to... - Did I do this again, I didn't do it the fucking first time, why would I do it the second time? No. Here, just grab the, grab the light. Grab the light. All right, Rico, you can come out, now. If it's Rico I'll kick his ass so badly. I'll kick your ass, 'cause you two are in on it. I'm not, I'm not in on it, I swear to God, dude. All right, there's nothing out here. Let's just go inside. I'm shutting this door, too. Locked. Let's go back. You feel better, now? I'm gonna show you, that's the same fucking kind of knock. Like, you can't argue that that is just a coincidence twice in a row. All right, you go ahead and get the video... I'll show you it, and then... I'm gonna go back to my cheese balls. Cheese balls. That's fucked up, dude. There she is. Hi... The executive producer hard at work. Of course. How is the documentary going? Oh, did I tell you about the thing with the knocks? What do you mean, "knocks"? Um... So like, two times I've been out there so far, Mmhmm. There's been like these knocks on the door. As what we, I think it is. It's really hard to explain... Just like someone knocking? I don't, like, I don't know. I have it on tape, actually. I got it both times. You got it? Yeah, and which is really weird, but um... I wanna see it. Yeah, how much time do you have before work? Half hour. Okay. I think we can do it. These right here. - Cheeseballs. - Cheeseballs. Watch, this is the clip. Record is a day and a half with one of them. Dear God. No, not dear God. Cheeseballs. - Did you hear that? - Yeah. What the fuck was that? Was that a knock? Sounded... The door's open. That door wasn't open before. Door was not shut behind you? Probably just, I don't know... No, 'cause see, okay, that was the first night. Probably Mikey or something, his cousin. He's a little shit. Don't you think that's something he would do. Do I think that a 12 year old would go across town into the countryside to knock on someone's door? Just to bother them while they're trying to shoot a documentary? - That... - I don't know. Makes zero sense. Maybe his house is haunted! That's what I was sayi... That's what I've been thinking, and I'm afraid to even bring it up to Luke, 'cause, I don't know how... I was kidding, okay? It's not some scary TV show. I never said it was, but... I think you'd be kind of a fool to, you know, turn the other cheek to something bizarre. I wouldn't think too hard about it. Okay. I just wouldn't. I don't think it's that big a deal. All right, well... Good? Were you scared? I'm not scared, - I'm just, whatever. - Okay. All right. But you gotta go to work pretty soon, huh? Yeah. Like now. We can get a quick session in beforehand? Okay bye. So explain the process, explain what happened here to this tractor. Well, someone went and unhooked the gravity box, which I kind of need right now. So... I don't know why they would just unhook it and leave it sit here, but... I'm gonna go ahead and do what real men do, and hook it back up with pure muscle 'cause I don't feel like starting the tractor. Eat your heart out, ladies. Yeah, eat your fucking heart out. Sorry to like, change subject, but like, - Yeah? Have you gotten any more of those knocks? - Oh... - On the door? Like, I haven't had anything, but I keep thinking about it and it's pissing me off. Well, I haven't thought anything about it. Are you shitting me? What, are you fucking paranoid or something, man? No, I'm not paranoid, but it seems so weird to me, and it's like, I would like an explanation. I mean, I don't know what... - I, okay... - It's an old house. It creaks, I don't know. Well, have you thought about, like, the fact that it, I don't know, could be like, haunted or something? No. I've lived here for 21 years. Never been a plate out of place, a chair tipped over, or nothing. Can we just kinda get off this, and go on to the next subject, here, man? What the fuck? All right, fine, I just... All right. So back up the tractor, you've proven that you're not a real man, so... Fuck you. That's closer. This is the best documentary material, - right here. - Oh yeah. That was a three finger banger winger dinger. I should really quit drinking so much beer. Yeah, you probably should. Wait, shh, shh. What? Did you hear that? That? Yeah, I heard that. Not your shitty... Stop. I thought I heard a knock. Did you hear a knock? Sorta sticking to... No, I didn't hear a damn knock. Should the door... I was fingering the noise putty. The door's closed. Yeah, it is closed. - And... - Three times. This is the third time... So is this one. Oh, bullshit. What is that, was that you? Uh, I'll just shut the water off. You'll just shut the water off? Yeah. Lucas, this thing was just moving. What? - What the hell? - The cross? I must a opened the door before I walked out. What? I opened the fridge door... No, you didn't open the fucking fridge door, Luke. We just walked by there. What do you want me to say? I want you to say, "What the hell was that about?" The faucet wasn't on, before, the fridge door wasn't I know, I know, - open before. - I know. I know. I know, I know. I know and I don't know. Well, great. So this is the third time. No knock, but now there's some more activity. - Well? - Guess so. - Rack it up. - Yeah. Rack it up to another coincidence, courtesy of Luke Rohl. All right, Lucas, could you please explain or justify why the hell we're going outside? In the middle of the night? Well, we have to go check on a cow that may be having difficulty calving, just to make sure that she's going through the process regularly, so... Follow me, if you would please. Oh, I'd love to walk in the dark with you. How romantic. On this isolated farm. Whatever you wanna call it. What would you call it? Home. This is the milk house. And in here... What the fuck? What the fuck, Luke? Are you fucking kidding me? Fucking A. I can't see anything. Hello? I can barely see any shit with this light. What the fuck, Luke? Please? All right, I'm not gonna stay out here and film. I don't feel comfortable. Yeah, that's probably... Can we just check on the calf in morning, or can you do it on your own? I don't wanna leave you out in the dust, but like, I just wanna go back inside. I gotta, I'm gonna head home or something. I don't feel comfortable any more with doors shutting. Yeah, we can... We can check on her in the morning. She's in the pen, she'll be fine. Forget the cow, what about us, dude? Dude. - What are you doing? - What's up? What? I fucking told you not to go on my computer when I'm not around. It, who fucking cares? I'm not doing anything wrong. What are you doing? I got projects in there I don't want you to mess with. I'm not gonna mess with your amateur projects. I'm editing footage. What are you working on? I'm trying to figure out when this shot was recorded. So I figured if you could get like a time... Like actual time that you shot it? - Yeah. - When it was recorded? I was thinking if you could get the time code, or something like that, I could figure it out from there. Yeah. You're trying to see when you shot it, - like at the actual hour? - Yeah. Of when you shot it? Go to projects, try this, project settings. And if you go to properties right there, it should be able to tell you, yeah. You should be able to figure it out from there. Rico! Luke. I'm just trying to straighten out the slider on the manure spreader. All right, just take a seat. I got important news. I was looking at the footage for the last couple nights, well, last few. The first knock, the second knock, if we're gonna agree that those are knocks, and then the shit with the doors. Yeah, sure, that's all weird, but... I looked back, honest to God, I can show you after you're done with chores. - Okay. - Each time, you can see in the shot, 11:55 pm on the dot. Bull shit. I swear to God, dude. Not 11:54, not 11:56, but 11:55 exactly. So I don't think that we should be sitting here and saying that it's just some kind of, you know... There's no way it's by chance, is what I'm trying to say. So I don't know, I know that you don't believe in the whole paranormal shit, but like, I think there, we haven't found signs of life, so like, I think that that should be considered something. So what are you implying? What are you... I'm not saying there's a demon in the house, or something, but like, can you not rule out that maybe there's a ghost of somebody? All right, now, well, "ghost of somebody"? Now I know when you're kinda taking this just a little tad too far into my personal life, here. Don't you think so? Oh, I didn't... I didn't mean it like that. I'm just saying like, what other possibilities are there? I'm not trying to disrespect you at all, but, I mean, think about it. We don't have any other... Listen. Fucking A. Just do your fucking documentary, here, okay? And just forget about the shit that's going on, okay? Does that fucking sound all right? Yeah, it's fine, I just... So what happens if it happens again? What are you gonna do? Probably be a little bit more believable, I don't know. Fuck, until it does happen again, I'm gonna go ahead and help you make this fucking documentary. That sound okay? That sounds great, I just... Good. It's 11:54 right now. Luke, would you care to explain what we're doing in your entryway at 11:54? - At night. - We... Like brave bastards. We are sitting here because at 11:55 the uh, director caught on tape both knocks. Excuse me. Both knocks and other random shit that has been happening. So we're gonna wait here, and at 11:55 we will see nothing is going to happen. You're an asshole, and this is why. 'Cause you agreed to do this... Yeah, and and you know... And I know you said it only because... You can bitch at me all you want, because it's 11:55 and nothing is happening. I knew you only agreed to do this because you wanted to spite me and prove me wrong. Well, I wanted to prove you wrong, yes, but I just wanted to show you that nothing is happening. Well just put the phone back in my pocket and give it a sec, will you... Wait, shh, shh. - You hear that? - Um... Here, take this, take the light. To the right. - Sounds like a song. - Yeah. Some fucking help you are, dog. I... It's still playing, isn't it? Yeah. Or am I just... Okay. Fucking, it's, won't stop? Go around the other way. - Split up? - Split up. Go that way, I'll go this way. Okay. Do you need a light? No, just go. Hello? Luke! - Luke? - What? What the fuck's going on, man? - I have no idea. - I thought you went around the house, again. Presley, what'd you see? What the hell? What were you doing just standing here? I don't know. You're fucking laughing, did you purposely do this? No, I did not, man. You're blaming me, and now you're the one standing here and giggling. I just don't believe any of this. At all. We're running around chasing a song, whatever that was, around your house. We sound like, try to explain it to somebody. Hey, what'd you do last night? Oh, I just chased a song around the house, and found nothing. We sound like we're fucking two mental cases, and how many times is this, what is this, the fifth, fourth time? I can't even keep track, any more, it's... How many times is this gonna happen before you're gonna get it through your head that we gotta do something? All right, all right, all right. What do you suggest we do? Well... I mean I guess like, the next logical step for me would be to go contact somebody, we can look up some like, I don't know, some people who deal with supernatural stuff. As, you know, professionally, and maybe contact them and see what they think? Are you happy you stayed out at 11:55? I don't know what I am. Right now we are trying to analyze the footage from last night. Take the light, take the light. Rewind it. Sounds like... Focus. I need your ears, - Yeah. My hearing's terrible. Said, "You can"... Said, "You can hide." But it said something else. The second part? Yeah, but there's still... Try and catch the mumbling of the first part one more time. All right. Are you okay if we listen to this a few more times? 'Cause I think we're getting close. Yeah, yeah, maybe you could just figure it out. I gotta get going back to the farm. I've been here for 20 minutes already. So I should probably get rolling, if that's all right with you. Yeah, that's fine. Um... Yeah, no worries. I'll keep looking at it, and if I get anywhere I will call you or, you know, come out there. Yeah. Don't be running and hiding once I find it. Are you suggesting that you're going to somehow attack and destroy some supernatural being? We'll see what happens. All right. I've listened to it over and over, I turned up the audio all the way. I got nothing besides the first few words are, "You can run, you can hide." And there's no song that exists, there's no... I looked at all the videos. Those lyrics don't match up the melody that was playing, that kind of song, that weird country shit. So I don't really know what to do that's about as far as I can go from here. Um... I mean, I guess the next step would be, you know, invite like a paranormal team or something like that in here? - What? - No. - Is that wrong? - No. No, that's bull shit. No, I don't believe that. You don't believe in the investigators? Well, what are you gonna do? I don't want people in my house. People I don't know like that, just going ahead, and being, "Oh, you have a ghost in this room," or, "Oh, there's paranormal activity going on in that room." I don't want that, no. Fuck that. Well then what are we supposed to do, then? I mean that's, we don't have anybody... - What about... - I... Wait, wait, wait, wait. I, I, I, I, I, today, Junior, come on. What do you got? What about Brandon? Herbert? Yeah, Herbert. Have you seen his statuses? Half of them are about ghost videos and all that shit. Maybe he has something, maybe he has some knowledge we... I mean, he seems like he would be kind of knowledgeable. Yeah, at least I graduated with him from high school. Sure, we can give him a shot versus a bunch of people I don't know. I'm gonna put him on speaker. All right. Brandon! Hey, how's it going, man? What's up? How you doing? I'm doing good, how about yourself? Good, good to hear from you. And we think that there's something else going on in the house, and you know, I've looked at all your statuses and all the stuff that you post, and it's all, you know, kinda, supernatural, you know, paranormal stuff. So I figured you'd be the expert on it, so... Would you be willing to help us out a little bit? Yeah, of course. You just gotta let me know, you know, what are dealing with, first off? Anything odd, out of the ordinary? Um... Have you ever heard of anything like music playing? Is that part of this... Um, I can't say I have. "Can't say I have." Okay. Thanks, man, I really appreciate it. No problem, any time. All right, have a good night. - Yep, you too. - Bye. Bye. This blows. Like a fricking ticking time bomb. You know? 11:55 rolls around, you're... Waiting to see what the fucking weird happens next. Yeah. Why don't we go just like, scan the perimeter, like, why don't we go deer shining or something like that? Yeah, sure, we can do that. Okay. Blow off some steam. Yeah. Shine some deer. Can I finally get you to drink a beer? - I'll consider it. - All right. You can film me drinking a beer, that'll be legendary, right there. It is, very much so. We are going out to see if we can find any deer just for like future, in the fall reference, for me, for hunting. And hopefully we'll get to see some deer activity tonight. But if not, there's always other nights, this is open any time of the year until 10, so... We'll go ahead and see what happens. And here's the light. Oh yes, yes, this is... This is super bad ass. Show you real quick just how bright it gets inside. I can't, jeez! It can get... That's the big leagues. It can get very bright, so... All right. You want me to shine, or you to shine? Yeah, you can go ahead. Well, uh, given circumstances, you know, which side of the truck I wanna shine, we'll go ahead and find out, here, - so... - Okay. I'll turn these off. I'll turn my high beams off, too, if you want. Yeah, that'll be better. This is absolutely creepy. I don't know how you do this on a normal basis. Especially with what's been going on. What're you talking about, dude? Fuck, this is a beautiful night. All the... This is a beautiful night! It's a beautiful night, but considering how much unexplained phenomenon has been occurring, I just don't like being out here. Well, fuck, I mean, we just planted corn, I mean, we're trying to find some deer to see where they're gonna be for fall, fucking A, man. This is a beaut, this is beauteous. That's a beaut, yeah... I'm Luke Rohl. I'll kick your ass. All right, um... Go over here in this direction. Want me to, you wanna shine this way? Yeah, shine it and I'll follow your light. All right. Hold it. I'm ready to get a kickass rack. Let's see something, let's see some deer. This'll be the only rack I'll see all year. Like that? That was awesome. Okay, I got it, got it, got it. - Okay. - You got it? Let's see what the fuck is up over, and... - Nothing. - There's nothing there. All right. Oh, oh fuck, there's a fucking plug right... That one out? Damn it. Does it have to be in park? No. It just, should shine out, there we go. What the fuck? What the fuck is that? Go, go, go! Shit, dude, that looked like... What the fuck happened to the light, man? Plug the light in, Luke! I'm trying, god damn it. Turn on the headlights. Fucking A. There we go. Luke, where the fuck... Um. What the fuck, Luke? Holy shit. We're so fucked. What do you mean, "We're so fucked"? I don't, that looked like fucking people, Luke. Fine, fuck it. We're getting the fuck outta here. That has to be, slow down, slow down. Fuck that, man. We're gonna get in fucking trouble, or... No, we're not. Fuck it, this is my land. I mean, it's just so fucking hard 'cause you have so much land, and like... Mmhmm. Like trespassing is something that you like, you know someone's doing it, but unless something happens it's like... 'Cause really, the thing is, it's like, they're just toying, they're messing, it's like, nothing substantial's happened, we're not hurt, nothing's been stolen, you know? Mmhmm. It's just like, I don't know, I feel like I'm getting pranked, and I just don't get the joke. I'm the same... And it's getting fucking bullshit. It's getting to be bullshit. It is. I'm in the same boat as you are, right now. Even more so, 'cause there's people on my land that I don't even... I don't know. I'm gonna go. Hey, at least you're going some place where they don't know where you live. That is true. Uh, do you wanna spend the night? I will take you... Nah, bro, I got chores in the morning. I can, okay. - I'll just hang, man. - All right, man. I don't think... We probably just caught 'em, or something. They were just fucking around, there, I don't know. Okay, well if anything happens, just call me. - All right. - All right, bro. I'm gonna head out. - See you later. - Take care. Yeah. Just let me know if anything happens. There it is. That's Pierce County Jail. Just to show you where we're at. We're sitting outside because in light of what happened last night, the fact that we caught a glimpse of some things that looked like people on Luke's property. So, what I'm hoping to do is to contact somebody, an officer, sheriff, somebody, and have him come out here as a neutral, third party, and hope that they can be out there and we can get something with them on camera, that way we have evidence. Sounds good? - Very good. - All right. Well, I'll be back. He's back. So that was horrible. I got immediately shut down. As soon as I mentioned that there would be a camera involved, pretty much the three people that were around the area said they would absolutely refuse to do it if there was any kind of filming involved. But I really wanna get it on camera. I'm just getting the last shot of Pierce County Jail, 'cause they... Cause they're idiots. Fuck you. I need you to be a third party. And how long do I gotta be there, for? I really don't want to, man. Well, I need you to be out there at 11:55 with us. I will buy you... - 11:55? Yes. I can't guarantee what'll happen, but I know something will happen, so I just need you out there. I will buy you an absurd amount of alcohol. All right, all right. But seriously, though, 11:55. I'm not staying there longer than 10 minutes. No, that's fine. I'm tired anyway, so... Okay, I'll just, we'll get everything together... Just call me when you need me, and... Thank you very much. God bless America, you're doing this for America. Peace out, brother. All right. So it's 11:55, now. Which means that any minute... Waiting around. Wasting my time. Not wasting your time. I got more editing to do, man. Here, give me this light. I'm gonna check. Hello? When is this supposed to happen? 11 fifty... Shh, - 11:55. Did you hear that? Shh. Hear what? That's the rain, dude. Just give it a sec. This is what happened last time. Luke doubted me, and we heard the fucking music, so... Just gimme a second, here take this light. Fucking wait, for like, - five minutes! - I came out here, I didn't wanna come out here in the first place. Just five more minutes. You called me out here. I mean Luke, it was good seeing you, but... Yeah. We've been sitting here for 20 minutes, and I'm just fuck, it's a waste of time. I have editing to do, - I have... I've got stuff. I don't wanna do what you guys're doing, so... Just give me five minutes. No, I'm outta here, see you man. You're an asshole. I don't buy that they're just taking an off night, when Rico's here to watch and be an outside party. Yeah, I... I don't know, dude, I don't know. If you're out there... You're dead! Me and Luke will find you. I feel like an idiot. I'm yelling at nothing. Thin air. You see anything? No. I don't. Well... So you're just gonna sit here and film? Until something happens... Are you gonna plug the camera in, or something, or? No, I can only record... These cameras only hold like, 29 minutes at a time, so... I'm gonna turn off the camera, and at any moment I'll be ready to film. Right here on the spot. All right, well... I'm gonna go lay down, just right there. So if anything happens, wake me up. - Luke. - Mmm. Wake up. - Wake up, man! - I'm waking up! It's time for celebration. - Celebration? - Yeah. We survived the night. Good to know. We'll celebrate, what time is it? It's a little past noon. Oh, for fuck's sakes, are you shitting me? What? I gotta go milk the cows, man! I mean... I mean nothing happened... Wait, wait, hold up a sec. What? - What the fuck? - What? Do you not realize that there is an empty spot, right here? I see that. That's where my car was. - Are you sure? - Am I sure... No, Luke, I think I parked it in the middle of town. Yeah, I'm positive, I parked it right here. Well, what the fuck? Well, I don't know what to say, I gotta get down there. So you're just gonna walk away? Dude, my car is gone! I didn't touch it. If you think somebody took it, then call the police. This is so fucked. Listen, dude, I don't know what else to do. I gotta go down to the barn. Are you... Thanks a lot. All right, I'll try to figure out this mess. And I need you to find some room in your heart, I know it might be tough for you, if you could just bring me into town. To my house. You know, fucking A man, you've been coming out here, invading my privacy, asking me to help you to film this damn thing. And you know, I'm six hours late for chores as it is, and though that's neither of our faults, but I just, I gotta stay here and get this done. It's just one... Do you understand, Luke? I don't think it's getting through your head. Now, we've been dealing with shit, you know, fridge doors, doors closing, knocks. That's kinda harmless, but this is breaking and entering, okay? This is a step up. And it's been a pattern, it just keeps getting worse and worse. So I would just really appreciate it if you'd bring me into town so I could figure this out before it gets any more out of control, because it's fucking out of control, right now. All right. I will pay you, I will... You don't have to pay me. I'll just, I'll go talk to Dick, and go from there. Okay, thank you very much. You owe me one. So Luke just dropped me off at my house, and... I find out that my mom's car, which I've been driving, that was stolen from Luke's, is parked in my driveway, in my garage. No marks. Nothing wrong with it. So you don't think it's weird? Well, I would never drink and drive, even if I did drink... So my car just magically appeared in the garage? That's what I'm telling you is so messed up about it, which is why I think that we should go to the cops. 'Cause I'm telling you, it's these people that me and Luke caught on camera, and I think that they're behind it. What do you think the cops are gonna do? I don't know, but... The car? They gotta do something. The car's here. But it was stolen! But it's, I mean, what's wrong with it? Nothing's here, I'm gonna look like I have an issue if I call the cops and say, "My car just moved from point A to point B." Yeah, you're the one who's not willing to look into it, so... Okay, I'll call the cops, I'll look like... They'll probably have me committed. Yeah, you probably should be committed. Okay, you need to get out of my house and go back to California. - Okay. - Bye now. What's going on, man? Hey, what's up, brother? I feel like we just keep rambling about "what do we do next, what do we do next," "what do we do next?" And I feel like we gotta just fucking take some action. I'm not saying it's your fault, I'm just saying ever since you started coming out here, these stupid fucking events have started happening. Well... If it wasn't for me, then we wouldn't have anything to film, anyway, so you should, you should be thankful that I'm out here, because without me you'd be pretty much nobody. I'd be "nobody"? What are you getting towards, there? I'd be "nobody". Are you saying... Well how many people... Are you saying you made me? Is that what you're leaning towards? Well how many people knew Luke Rohl before 2,000 Miles From Hollywood? You know, most people thought you were just some dumb hick before that. Oh, oh, "some dumb hick." I didn't say it. Yeah, most people did. Well, you know, I'm glad that everybody thinks I'm not some dumb hick from a faggot with a goofy haircut holding a camera. What do you think about that, huh? Well, wow, you're a tough guy. You can sit here and flex your big muscles all day, but it doesn't mean anything. You know, how about you just... We're done, how 'bout this? Fuck it. Go back to fucking Hollywood, or wherever the fuck you goddamn came from, all right? I've had enough of this Fuck, god damn, fuck, shit, fuck. fucking shit. All you do is cuss, and that doesn't mean jack shit to me. It don't mean jack shit to you? Put the fucking camera down. - I'm done with you. - Hey, Get the fuck out, I can... This shit's worth more than your god damn life. - Yeah, well... - Yeah. I know how much your life is worth, and I tell you this fucking lens is worth more than your life. My tobacco spit is worth more than your life. Ooh, your tobacco spit. And you're not a hick? That's... I'm proud of who I am, all right? Yeah? I'm damn proud of it. And if you're proud of who you are, good. A filmmaker, yeah. Yeah. And I can make a thousand other films about a thousand other people... Then how about this? How about since you can go ahead and make so many other fucking stories, go ahead and just fucking get off my fucking property. Go film something else. Maybe as soon as you leave, the fricking whatever's been happening, those other people we see will be gone, too, how's that, huh? Yeah, that sounds great. Good. Missing out on your chance at fame, that's fine by me. I'm happy with my small life, here. That's good. Well, I hope you have fun, hope you're happy with your new friends, too, because I'm sure that they'll be coming to pay you a visit as well, so... I'm sure they'll be gone just as soon as you leave. - Fuck off. - Asshole. Three of a kind. So what's up, what are you doing? What? Why are you filming me? 'Cause I got nothing else really to film, going a little bit stir-crazy without anything else to film. Well... I just like to film. Why don't... You're a good subject. Why don't you just go and talk to Luke? - It's been like... - Yeah... A week, it's been a week. Okay, so what? He hasn't contacted me, Well... so what makes you think that... Well so what, this is your project. You're gonna stop in the middle of your project 'cause you and your friend are having a feud? - Not even a fight. - It's not... You guys are arguing. Well yeah, because he's blaming me for all the shit that's happening. When it's like, okay I'm not orchestrating these events. Well since you've been around, that's when it's happening. So you're taking Luke's side? No, I'm not taking Luke's side, but still... Well, what do you want me to do about it? I'm sure he's kind of like, annoyed by it. Yeah, I'm annoyed by it, too. Don't you get it? That's why I've been hanging out, here. I don't wanna be around him. I don't want you here if all you're gonna do is film me. Why not? 'Cause. How about for our anniversary, you get the fricking camera out of my face? I would appreciate that. - I'll consider it. - No. - No? - Don't consider it. - Okay. - Just do it. Luke... Answer the door, Luke. I texted you, there he is. Luke "Hollywood" Rohl. What's going on? Oh, is that what I'm known as, now? That's, I guess that's what I'm gonna call you. All right. So... Back at it with the camera, I see. Uh, well, I figured you called me, saying it's an emergency, I gotta come over here, I figured why would I not bring the camera? I figured you were comfortable with it enough, so... Would you mind turning it off? Well, just... I... I found this. Five minutes before I called you. What the fuck is that? It's a DVD. I don't know, is it something of your doing? Trying to get back at me? Trying to get back at you? Did you stop here and drop it off? No, I didn't... Before you went to Prescott? Or what? No, I don't even know... I haven't watched it yet. You haven't watched it? No. Do you mind if I keep the camera going? If we watch it? I don't care. All right, turn it on. Grab some popcorn, the Luke Rohl show's about to begin. I'm glad you're finding humor in this. Well what the fuck am I supposed to do? I mean... I can't, it's too, I'm gonna turn... "You can run, you can hide." Wait, I'm trying to focus. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, whoever's watching this right now, this is... Lower it. ♫ You can run, you can hide Oh, my God. This is the trailer for the documentary that we made last year. Oh, my God. Fuck. Turn it off. Fuck that. They know about our past. These people are fucking experts. Apparently. Wow. I'm gonna be honest with you. I am sorry about what I said before. Um... I'm just kinda frustrated from everything that's been happening. I know. And I really didn't mean to disrespect you in any way. I just like, everything's just culminating and the fact that this was put on your door when I wasn't here, I wasn't even bothering with you, you know? And you were telling me that when I left, they would leave. And clearly that's not the case. Do you wanna live in a constant state of just fear and just on the edge, knowing that like, somewhere out there someone's just... I'm not afraid of anything. I think it's time to actually like, okay, what time is it? Check your phone. 11:37. Which means we have, roughly fifteen minutes, okay? So we gotta do something now. Tonight. Tonight's the night. Let's fucking do it. I told you, I'm gonna fix this. What are you... The fuck is that? Put the gun down. Jesus Christ, you're a fucking mad man. No, I'm not a mad man, protecting my own property. Well, I don't want you to fucking shoot anybody in the face. I'm not gonna shoot- - That's murder, and you'll be arrested. I'm not gonna do anything like that. So what are you planning on doing with that? Just a scare tactic is all it is. Take the west side of the farm, and I'll go on the east side. You wanna split up. Yes. So, you have a gun, and what do I have? Camera. You're faster, run from 'em, I don't know. We capture these, - This is... we capture these fucking people, okay? - Yeah. - We get 'em here, I want a confession out of each one of them, however many there are. I'm sorry for the ups and downs and all the shit that's been happening, I... Yeah, it's uh... It's sucks it's coming down to this, but I really don't care. I have had it. Luke... Hello! Shit. Hello! I can see the light! Shit. Shit. I have evidence. Luke! Luke! Luke, I think they're coming back! Towards the house! Luke! Luke, get your fucking ass over here. Luke... Luke, I'm going in the milk house, they're in there! Come on, you assholes. I'm not afraid of you. Shit. I'm not afraid of you. Ah, shit. Shit. Fuck. Where the fuck are you? I got you on camera. I know you're in here. Come on, you fuckers... Shit. Luke? Shit. What the fuck's that? Luke! Fuck. Luke! Luke, I just got 'em! I just got 'em! They're wearing fucking masks, Luke. What? I got 'em, it's fucking Schuster. What? It's Schuster! Schuster? - Move, asshole. - What the hell... Schuster, what the... Don't put the gun down, Luke. What's going on? Schuster, are you... Tell me, what are you two doing? Get him inside, Luke. Dude, dude... This is unfucking believable, Schuster. Just take two, ugh! Stop, dude, what the hell? Put him in the chair. Sit down. Okay, dude, you need to settle down and tell me what's going on. I want you to explain everything. Explain everything that's going on... with the stupid light. What do you mean, "explain everything"? I was just walking up here. I was just going for a walk. Going for a walk. Yeah. Okay, so why don't you explain all the other shit that's been going on, here? What other shit? - What other shit? - The knocks, - The knocks. - Fucking, random fucking shit. The faucet, the fridge door, the milk house door. The music. What? Why do you... Where the fuck did you find that stupid song? What do you mean the music, I haven't done shit. I've been down at my house the whole time. The whole time? What are you... No, I, this is the first time I've ever been up here. You didn't even call me or anything before you came up here. What's going on? What the fuck are you doing? He caught you on his property. I wasn't doing anything wrong. I believe trespassing is illegal. I'm not positive on that, I'm not a... Okay, if you guys really wanna know what I was doing, and if it's gonna settle you down, I just come up here to smoke weed every now and then. What? - Smoke weed? - Yeah. - This guy's... - Yeah, Marijuana. Marijuana, oh, thank you for informing me what marijuana is. 'Cause, 'cause, nobody these days know what the fuck weed is. But anyway, that's besides the point. - Dude. - What... This is unbelievable. So you come up here, you smoke... I just come up here, I sit down, I smoke a bowl and I go back to my life. Here's one reason why that's bull shit. You live down the hill a considerable amount... So I'm gonna sit where my mom can see me smoke a bowl, 'cause I'm pretty sure she'll be very, very fine with that. Well it makes no sense why you'd walk this far... 'Cause I'm at the bottom of the hill, she can't see up a hill. Fine. So, regardless of why you're coming up here to smoke weed, what's your connection to those three people? - Three people? - What? Yes, Lucas, What's he talking about? - Three people, - What fucking people? I was yelling at you, when you were over here trying to handle this guy. Do you know anything about these three people? I don't know what the heck's going on as it is. No, it's the three people that we saw, I swear. Same outfit as the three people in the field that we saw that one day, that one night we were shining. What's been going on? Who the fuck are they? They were in the milk house, and it looks like they're wearing a mask of a cow, a horse and a pig, and they're here, Luke. And I wanna know what this fucking asshole has to do with it. I have nothing to do with any of these. I don't care, what the fuck, your weed, you make people wear stupid ass masks... Are you kidding me? I came up here by myself. Why would I bring Just shut the fuck up anyone up on - and tell me - your land? - The truth. I am telling you the truth, dude. You've known me since kindergarten. You know I wouldn't lie to you. I've done nothing to you. I've just been your friend, dude. That's all I've ever been. I don't buy it. You can roll your eyes all you want, but... Come on, dude, why would I do anything like that? I believe him. I just come up here to smoke. You believe him? Yes, I believe him. Are you kidding me? This is... Why do you have a sudden change of heart? He's on your property... Because I just realized that I've known the kid since fricking elementary school and he's never done me no wrong at all. About time. And he's always been truthful to me. I can't... It's the fucking knock! I'm here and I haven't done anything. Yeah, you're here 'cause you're the fucking mastermind, which is... Why the hell would I be the mastermind? We went through this. Grab your gun. Where the fuck is the gun? God damn it, Luke. It was right there. Schuster, I'm going to destroy you. Why, I didn't do anything. I had nothing to do with this. I'm grabbing the light. I'm grabbing a light, this is fucking bullshit. Yeah, you just... You know what? Schuster, just go. Go, get out this. I'm getting out of this shit, it looks fucking... I swear to God, Schuster. This is fucking crazy, you guys are nuts. If I ever find out that you're involved with this, I will kill you. - Fine. See you... - Just go. I don't, I just don't get why you'd just let him go. I gotta, it's... He's been a friend of mine forever, I can't... Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. So we're fucking back to square one. This is just fucking dandy. Well? Age old question, now what, Luke? We just lost our prime suspect. My gun. Okay, your gun's gone. So that's just fucking awesome. Now what? He's our only fucking option. Shut the fuck up. Are you fucking kidding me? What the fuck is that? What the fuck, get out of my... Hang on, easy. Do you have any kind of weapon? My fist, that's my fucking weapon. The fuck? Is that the, is that the tractor? My tractor's running, what the fuck? Luke... Why is my tractor running? What? God damn it! They're fucking everywhere, Luke. Hey, just be careful! What? What? - Fucking... - Oh shit, - What is that? - What is that? What the fuck is... Fuck, get, get fucking back! Luke! Go! Fuck, Luke! Shit, shit, shit. Shit. Dude, they're fucking closing in, man. Holy fuck, we are so fucked! We gotta call the cops. You got your phone? Call the cops. No, I don't have my phone, shit, - it must've... - Mine's, - Mine's over here. - It must've dropped out when I was... Mine was right here. Are you fuck... Oh, my God. Where the fuck's my phone? Okay, let's just not lose our... We just got, rela... Okay. - Fuck. - We need to concentrate, we need to think of a game plan. Game plan. What do you want for a fucking game plan? They're getting closer. No shit, they're getting closer. I can fucking see that. I don't wanna go out there on my own. This is so fucked. Luke, they're fucking messing with us. And they're winning, they're just doing shit! None of it's making any sense. They're just... They're just cornering us, and it... I'll make sense. I'll make some fucking sense of this. What are you gonna, what do you... Should we stay here? Should we go? We're staying here. You know why we're staying here? It's 'cause of this right here. What the fuck? It's that fucking song. What is this? Move the curtain. That stupid fucking song, again? Shit. What is that? Number three? Fuck thinks they're Johnny Fucking Cash! Fuck, they're just standing out there, Luke. Fucking shit. They're right out there, Luke! I see that! Fucking shit. The music stops! They're just toying with us. You don't think I know that? Okay, we got, we have to think of some kind of plan. We need like a diversion or something, I... And see, it's going on and off, on and off. They're turning shit on, they're turning shit off. The truck is probably off, the tractor's off, they're just dicking around! Okay, fuck, we gotta figure something out, now. I've about had it, Cordero. I've about fucking had it, too, Luke. We gotta figure out something right now. I'm more than okay with this. Nobody's there. This is my home. Nobody's there. Nobody's outside? You just looked? No, Luke, nobody's... Are you sure? Are you sure? I'm positive, nobody's there. I'm assuming they're gonna come in no matter what, Luke, they're getting closer and closer. Fucking hope they come in. I'm fucking ready! You take 'em down. Take whoever's here. Can you handle two people? Yes. Do you see the size of me? I will fuck an army. I'm gonna show it to the authorities, and I'm gonna get us outta here. I'm gonna get this tape, you're gonna be safe, I promise I will get you outta here. I love you, man. I'm sorry about getting you into all this. Let's do it, and do it fast. Okay. Let's do this. Okay, just... I have faith in you. Come on, Luke. Fuck. Come on, fucking, come on. What the fuck? You're on, motherfucker! Oh shit, shit. - God damn... - Luke! Shit. Fucking shit. Fuck, shit. Fuck. Fuck. Shit. Shit. Shit. Fuck. Oh, God. God damn it. Shit. Help! Oh, fucking shit. Oh, fuck. Oh, Luke, I'm coming. Oh, shit. I'm so sorry, Luke. I'm coming. Luke... Luke. Luke. Luke! Luke! Fucking shit. What are you doing, here? What are you doing? Oh, fuck. God. Damn it, Luke. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my fault. Come on! Come on, you fucking... You fuckers! Shit. Shit. Shit. Fuck. Shit. Come on. Rico! What's up, dude? What's happening? How'd shooting go? What's up? They took Luke! Hold on, what are you talking about, Dude? They fucking took Luke. Those three people, I told you about that. Chill out, dude, hold on, chill out. What are you talking about? You remember when I told you there was three people harassing us, - Yeah. - And you said that it was fucking bullshit, well it's not. - Luke's gone. - Relax. - I barely... - Chill, chill. What are you, okay, what are you talking about. "Luke's gone", what are you saying? They took him. There was three people on his farm, they took him, there was masked people. - I saw them. - Well hold on, why didn't you call me? They took my phone! They took Luke's phone. Okay relax, relax, chill out. Put the fucking camera down. Chill. God damn it. Chill for a second, dude, okay. Just let's go talk to Mom or something. - Fuck. - Just relax. Okay, what are you talking about, "Luke is gone"? Mom? Mom! - What? - Mom, Cordero's freaking out. Luke's gone! Relax, dude, stop. - Call the cops. - Gone where? We're not calling the cops, chill. Call the cops! They took Luke! He's freaking out over something. I told you before that there were three people that were there and... What are you talking about. You have to relax, why are you... You don't get it! Because, I... It could've been avoided, and you guys just dismissed it all and now Luke's probably dead. Okay, relax. Is he kidding? Is he being funny, or what's he talking about? I don't know... - I'm not being... - Just chill out. - Don't understand... - I don't know if you're joking, or not, why are you fucking talking like this? I'm not - Just relax. Joking. Why would I come to the house at 3 am and joke? Why didn't you call me? Why didn't you call me? I just told you! My phone was gone. They stole my phone. Right, let's just, okay. No, I'll show you, I have it on camera. I caught them, and you call the fucking cops. We need... No, I'll show you right now. Well then show me, I'm... I'll show you, Mom. I have it. Oh, shit! Rico! Rico, help! Rico! Hello, my name is - Howdy. Cordero Roman. I'm Luke Rohl. I am the filmmaker, camera man, everything but the talent for this documentary. So I got a new camera, new equipment. We're ready to rock and roll. I'm super excited for this project, and we'll be filming stuff to show you what's going on behind the scenes. And thank you for watching this film. Hopefully you'll be watching it and watch this afterwards. What're we gonna call it? I have no idea for a title, yet. Tentatively titled, "1,000 Miles From Hollywood", because We're getting closer. We're getting closer, so... Hopefully everything goes well. I'm coming for you, Bruckheimer. You hear me? - Coming for you. - Coming for you. Thought that went well. Yeah. Sure.
