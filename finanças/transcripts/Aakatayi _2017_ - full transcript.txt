Smoking and drinking alcohol is injurious to health. Mumbai (Phone rings) Hello! We caught the wrong man. Let him go. Really? - Yes. I found out just now. Did you inquire correctly? We checked his whole background. It is not him. Let him go. - Okay. What? It is not him, Boss. He.. It is not him? They checked everything. What do we do now, Boss? (Gunshot) (Brakes squeal) Boss, our thrashing has left him almost dead. What should we do? Darn! He escaped! (Snaps finger) I have to find him no matter where he is on this earth! I won't spare him! I won't! (Gunshot) Throw him in the sea. (Groans) Vishakapatnam Why should we hide in the library to escape class? I can't bear this silence. This silence is better than that violence. (Phone rings) Who is that? How many times should I tell you to keep.. ..the phones on silent mode. Buddy! Our library is like Sai Baba's Temple on Thursday.. ..it is filled with beautiful girls. You want some entertainment now, right? Hmm, yes. Okay, I will give you a live show. Watch it. Yes, come. Come straight. Did you hear everything? (Slaps) Have you lost it? What are you talking? Telugu. - What is it, dear? What's the matter? Even though you are here.. ..he is shamelessly saying vulgar things to me. What? What did you say? Nothing, madam. I just said 'Come straight.' No, madam. He said 'You're hot. Come home tonight'.. ..but now he is changing his words. Even if you stand on a bench you'll still be shorter than her. How dare you! Boys like you should be severely punished. Yes, madam. We should courageously.. ..file a 'Nirbhaya' case on such men. We should publicly hang them near the port. Buddy, they are going to hang you. Slap yourself and say sorry. Sorry? Why should I? I don't say sorry even to my father. If you don't say sorry to her.. ..this movement that started in the college library.. ..will become a tempest and spread to the whole country.. ..until you say sorry. Buddy, you'll be in trouble. Say sorry. Sorry, sister. Forgive me. I'll never cross your path again. I'll deal with you later. Don't worry, dear. Be brave. Thank you, madam. It was good entertainment, wasn't it? Yes. - I'm so happy. Excuse me. What is the rate? 11. What? 10,000 for one night? What? Miss, you've misunderstood me. Hey! What are you saying? How dare you ask me what my rate is? If you discuss your rate like this in public.. ..and if everyone hears you.. ..I can never get married in the future.. ..my life will be ruined, I'll never find a wife. Have you gone mad? What is going on here? Sir! She said 'You are cute. Will you join me tonight? ..My rate is 10,000 rupees.' What? 10,000 for a night? Yes. - Sir, listen to me. He asked.. Quiet. I will settle this matter. What did he ask you? He asked 'What is the rate?' What did she say? She said '10,000 rupees.' Sir, I said 11. Did you hear that, sir? She increased her rate already. Oh no! I think this is about call money. I've to be careful. Look, dear! I know that you are the HOD's daughter.. ..but you can't disgrace his name like this. What you are doing is very wrong. Don't repeat such mistakes. Go home. This is called tit for tat. The subject is closed. Everyone go to class. Everyone leave. Get out. Three main reasons of this theory.. ..in this semester.. Excuse me. Listen! We won't tolerate it anymore. You've to settle this matter today. - That's it. I don't understand what you are saying. Enough! Enough is enough! Suspend Vikrant and throw him out! - Yes. Will you tell me the problem or continue to waste time? He is our college topper. Sir! I understood that you all are angry with me. We have a class now. We'll talk about it later, sir, please. Whoa! Don't act innocent in front of us! We know you! We have to settle this right here right now! Okay. Are you sure about it? Our decision is final. No one can change it. Okay. Bablu is ready to give you a live telecast.. ..of the details of this case. Bablu! Bablu, can you hear me? Yes, Vikrant. I can hear you. Go ahead. So, what information do you have about our lecturer.. ..Romantic Ramanadham? Vikrant, we have a video in our possession.. ..that shows Ramanadham sir's charm and wit. We can see it now. Over to studio. Hi! - Hi! Sir! Don't you think Shailaja has put on a little weight? Why wouldn't she? She has no work to do. Since her husband gets tired after working all day in office.. ..I don't think he gets intimate with her at night. You are very naughty. (Laughs) I'm leaving. - Stop it! What is your age? And what are you doing? Do you think nobody will stop you? One minute, sir. I don't have time. Bablu! Can you hear Vijay Kumar sir's anguish? I can hear it, Vikrant. - Carry on. Where was our sir last night between 10 pm to 12 am? Last night our Vijay Kumar sir went to Rang Mahal theater.. ..to watch an amazing movie called.. ..'Beauty From The Alley And A Bed Of Jasmines'.. ..which has been successfully running for four weeks. It is time for my special class. See you later. And talking about you.. Sir! - Huh? You have extra-ordinary skills in multi-tasking. Four girls at the same time. Hema, Rekha, Jaya and Sushma. 24/7 chatting, flirting, photo-sharing and so on. Are you wondering how we know that? Meet your chatting friends. Hema, Rekha, Jaya and Sushma. You'll never progress in life, useless bloody idiots. Haven't you seen enough scandals for today? Why are you still standing here? Let's go. They will ruin us if we stay here. Let's go. Superb. - (Laughs) (Music) "Go, let's go.. Like a rocket" "Go, let's go.. Like a missile" "Go, let's go.. Like a crashing wave" "Go, let's go.. Like a massive mountain" "Run like soldiers in warfare" "Fly like an eagle tearing the skies apart" "You are a hero" "Unleash.. Unleash the great courage in your heart" "Play.. Play until you win.." "There's a question and an answer.." "..and there is research in between." "There's defeat and victory.." "..and there's training in between." "There's languor and vigor.." "..and there's determination in between." "Did you notice this thing?" "Every man that is born has to die one day" "And there's life in between" "There should be a meaning to that life" "You are a hero" "Unleash.. Unleash the great courage in your heart" "Play.. Play until you win" (Music) "Can we be naughty at 60 like we were at 20?" "Can we waste our life trying to be a good boy? "Can we miss the fun for the world around?" "Can we get back our youth once we lose it?" "Even if you are naughty.." "..you'll see that you'll gain victory" "The world will stand in a queue.." "..to click a selfie with you" Oh no! We are dead. Daddy! "You are a hero" "Unleash.. Unleash the great courage in your heart" "Play.. Play until you win" (Laughs) - (Phone rings) (Gasps) (Phone rings) Who is it? Let's go. (Phone rings) What should I tell mom? What should I tell her? What should I tell her? - (Phone rings) Hello? Where are you? Mom, I'm.. Bablu got tickets and forced me to.. ..come to a movie with him. Movie? Why can't I hear any sounds then? Is it a silent movie? No, Mom. It started just now. What happened to this city? It is filled with stifling smoke and grime. Why doesn't anyone speak up? We should put an end to this reckless behavior. Smoking is banned in public places. Banned in public places. It is okay to smoke here. That ad proves that you are in the theater. Actually, Bablu is a useless fellow. I'm afraid that he'll be a bad influence on you. Come home as soon as the movie finishes. Bye, Mom. - Bye, Mom. All parents in this world feel that their son is a saint and.. ..all his friends are useless. (Claps) There is no end to my son's experiments. He has turned this house into a magical den. Wake up, son. Did you forget that you have a boxing match today? Daddy! Please! I don't like boxing or karate. Leave me alone. (Siren wails) Oh no! Mom is coming. Portrait changed. She'll kill me if she sees the cigarette. Mom! Good morning, Mom! My darling son! - (Chuckles) Why are you disturbing him early in the morning? I am disturbing him? Is that what you think? (Laughs) Both mother and son are the same. Son is smart, his mother is smarter than him. Here, take them. Oh no! - Come on, let's go. Bye. - Bye. What's up? You said you'll bring a player for practice.. ..but instead you came back with a wrestler. To become a wrestler, he has to compete with a wrestler. (Laughs) Poor thing. Looks like the boy is scared. You don't know him. He's like a rocket. Once he starts, he'll stop only when he wants.. ..nobody else can stop him. Really? You are no wrestler and he is no champion. Even if you both come at me together.. ..you can't harm a single hair on my head. Hey! - Huh? He doesn't need to fight. I'm enough to take you down. Come on, then. Yeah! Come on! Hmm. (Grunts) Darn! (Laughs) (Groans) How long can you endure it? Take my advice and sign the papers. I'd rather die than sign those papers. I know how to make him sign the papers. I'll get the documents signed and sent to Mumbai. Give me the knife. (Screams) I'll sign. I'll sign. Paper.. Pen.. Paper.. Sign here. Subhani! I'm an MLA. I'm in politics. You turned me into a goon again. Thank you. Murthy! - Yes, sir? Remove the knife from sir's leg.. ..and get him treated in Care Hospital. - Okay, sir. Give me the documents. Bablu! - Yes, Auntie? Do you want an 'Arisa'? I'll eat it without complaining. Oh dear! Why are you eating those 'Dosas'? Hmm. They are leftovers from last night. I was going to feed them to the dog. (Coughs and splutter) You could've told me before. You think only you can play pranks? Wow! Well played! (Laughs) Uncle, I need to ask you one thing. You already asked. I need to ask you two things. You already asked. Oh, is that how you'll play it? Okay, I have to ask you four things. You already asked. When? - Just now. Every family has one weird person. But everyone in this family is weird. - Okay. Bye, Mom! Hey, wait a minute. I cooked Malabar Spinach Lentil Soup.. ..Bitter Gourd Fry and Bottle Gourd Curry. Itchy Leaves Fry, Aloe Vera Curry.. ..Crown Flower Chutney and Soap Nuts Gravy. You should've made those too. Tell me when you are free. I'll make them especially for you. - Make them for Uncle. Ignore him. Finish your box. Don't share it with him. Oh no! Eat the whole thing. Let's go. We are getting late for class. The temple is right beside your house. It's a blessing. I wonder where he is. Find him. Here he comes. Your mom works so hard to cook strange recipes for you. And this crazy man is always waiting for you. Poor mom. She cooks these dishes so lovingly for me. I don't want to hurt her, and I don't want to throw this food.. ..so I give it to him. Mom is happy because she thinks I ate the food. This man is happy because he is getting food. All in all, I'm happy. You didn't ask me to eat that food. I'm happy. Nice beggar. All the best. Lunch box for him and bags for me. Well done. I'll hold it. Didn't you go the class yet? Are you new to the college or have you lost your mind? Don't you know that this is Dinesh's parking place? Put up a board. - (Slaps) What did you say? Shut up and get lost! They are threatening people using Dinesh's name. Go park the bike there. Let's see what they do. No, buddy. We are already in Dinesh's bad books. And his brother is competing to become a minister. Do we really need this now? They are controlling students because students fear them. Remove it. Remove it. Now go. (Brakes squeal) (Tires squealing) Hi, Uncle! Hi, Anagha! How are you? How is Delhi? It asked me to go to Andhra immediately, so I came. Okay. Will your father ever step on this earth.. ..or will he retire while going around in flights? (Laughs) You are his childhood friend. You know him better than me. I came here to stay with my grandma.. ..until mom and dad return from Australia. (Laughs) That's good. Anyway, I have completed all the formalities. Here you go, your final year admission papers. Okay. I've an important meeting. I've to make a move. Take a tour of the college and come to the canteen. Shilpa is in class, I'll tell her to meet you. Okay. "This is my first love letter" "I wrote it because I couldn't talk to you" "I couldn't stand before you and express my feelings" "I didn't know enough words to express them" "I didn't know enough words to express them" I love you so much, Divya. I cannot live without you. You don't have to give me a reply now. You can think it through and give me a reply tomorrow. I'll be waiting in the park for you. (Laughs) Why are you laughing? Nothing. You can tell me. Are you going to the park tomorrow? How can I not accept him after this thrilling proposal? Give me that card. The card is worth 70 rupees. The cost of that rose will be 20 rupees. That cold drink is 15 rupees. And the song that he sang.. ..he didn't put in any effort to write a special song for you. So, he spent just 105 rupees to win you over. What else can a man do to propose? Does he have to spend thousands and millions? I'm not talking about money. A guy's proposal should be shockingly amazing. Your heart should just stop beating for a moment. You should feel that you are born only for him. Do you have a boyfriend? No. You'll never have one. I had a strange dream last night. What? I'm walking to the Himalayas for something. For what? I'm crawling and jumping. I'm surrounded by valleys. Bone-biting cold. But nothing is deterring me. Oh. Then I threw a rope from this mountain to that mountain. While I'm crawling, crawling, slowly crawling.. ..it suddenly broke.. What broke? The rope. - Oh, the rope. I went rolling down the valley and fell into a river. I heard some voices. I felt as if someone touched me. I found a ring in the water. I put it on my finger. What happened next? My dream came to an end and I was at home. What are you scared about? It's just a dream. That's what I thought at first. But when I opened my eyes.. ..that ring was really on my finger. Oh my dog! Moreover, ever since I put it on my finger.. ..I can see everyone's past, present and future. Wow! I can't believe this. The ring from his dream is really on his finger. This is amazing, surprising and thrilling. Order this ring right now. Only 2,299 rupees. - Hey! I'm telling you the truth. Truth? Really? Alright, say something about me. I've known you since you were in knickers. There's nothing new to tell. Okay, you need someone new. Right? Look, a beautiful girl that can be on Filmfare cover page. Tell me about her. Hello! I saw the movie.. ..'Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari' at least 30 times. Hello! We are ardent fans of the 'Boss' too. We've seen that movie 105 times. Okay. Since you claim this is a movie, I'll prove it to you. Your name has three syllables. The first syllable starts with A. You are the only daughter to your parents. You like puppies. You have one too. Your favorite number is 7. Your favorite hero is Chiranjeevi. And color black. You've recently moved here. You've total three birthmarks on your body. One is on your waist on the left side. The second one is.. Stop it! Hey, Anagha! What's wrong? Shilpa! He is not a human. He's a monster. He's telling each and everything about me. So he played a prank on you too. What do you mean? He is Vikranth. Our college's genius and my best friend. And he has played pranks on almost everyone. What did you do? Actually, madam's entry was like an action sequence. So I planned this to make my intro equally exciting. As soon as I came, I came to know your full name.. ..using your car number plate. And your name gave me your Facebook ID. All these details were posted by you on Facebook. God! You scared the hell out of me. I've never seen anybody like you. Daddy told me that you were here. So I came here directly. - That's her! I'm so happy to see you. What's new? I heard you showed something to my boys. Show it to me too. Sit down! Who are you? Do you know who you are messing with? Is she your girlfriend? She's a new student. She doesn't know how things work here. Leave her alone. Mind your business, you son of a.. (Groans) This is between you and me. Don't drag my parents into it. You! Oh no! (Bottle smashed) Stop it! Is this a college or a local liquor shop? Sir! He started the fight. No, sir. He was the one who misbehaved.. Shut up! Be silent, you both! You were here when the fight started, right? Hmm. Whose fault is it? Who started it? Come on, answer me. Hey! Sir.. I suspend you from college for a week. But.. Get out! Hey.. Have you gone crazy? You said he's your best friend. You said he's a good guy. Why did you turn him into a scapegoat for a scoundrel? Why don't you speak? (Crying) What's wrong? What happened? I had no choice. Dinesh is not a human, he's a monster. One day in a party.. (Crying) He's blackmailing me that if I don't do as he says.. ..he'll turn that video into a CD and sell it in the market. Not just me, many other girls are his victims too. Why can't you inform uncle and file a police complaint? His brother is a local MLA. A heartless goon. From constables to politicians everyone is scared of him. Don't worry. I'll talk to uncle. Okay? What are you thinking about, Uncle? I don't have the courage for that, dear. If people find out about this.. ..they will say that Principal's daughter has no principles. Dinesh is a scalawag and his brother is a cruel monster. I can't even beg someone to help me in this matter. A small problem.. Just a small problem can end lives. But every problem has a solution, sir. She wanted to escape from that problem. But he removed that problem forever. How dare you refuse to give tickets to my men? You are the new manager. But I'm Jagadamba Jaani. I'm the local man. We sold all the tickets online. I have no tickets. Quiet! Only I can do Power Star's functions around here. If you don't give us tickets, you'll lose your wickets. Go get the tickets. Go now. Long live Jaani! Long live Jaani! Long live Jaani! Long live Jaani! Long live Jaani! Long live Jaani! (Drums playing) (Phone rings) Hello? Really? Where? I'm coming right now. Buddy, please don't go. Please.. Let me go. I have to settle this matter today. Listen to me. They are not good people. Forget it. Forget it? How can you say that? Who is he? He's my God. What's wrong, brother? Who are you? I'll tell you. We are eagerly waiting here to celebrate.. ..our hero's movie and enjoy it. But a few people are making pirated copies of the movie. I'm going to kill those rascals and sprinkle their blood.. ..on our hero's cut-out. Is that wrong? Bravo, brother! You are like pure gold! Don't worry. I'm PK's fan. I'm more dangerous than AK47. Messing with a Power Star's movie.. ..is like messing with a power plant. Let's go. Let's teach them a lesson. No, sir. I don't want to cause any trouble to you. Don't worry. We are coming with you. You can't say no. (Door bell rings) Who are you? Search the place. Search every inch. Go. Okay, sir! (Slaps) There are two ways to watch a newly released movie. One is to watch it in a theater and the other is.. ..to watch a pirated copy of it. We chose the first way. You selected the second way. Once. Just once, try to see it our way. Once. I wonder how pirated copies are hitting the market.. ..even before the movie gets released. I don't know who is doing it. I get so angry. We are waging an invisible war with an invisible enemy. Go to the theater to watch a movie if possible. Otherwise, shut your mouth and sit at home. But know that we are here. Forget the man who knows how to catch it.. ..the man who knows how to squeeze it is more important. I'm no longer worried that the theater manager.. ..won't give us tickets. Done. Call him. Okay, sir. Long live Power Star! Long live Jaani! Long live Power Star! Long live Jaani! Long live Power Star! Long live Jaani! Long live Power Star! You are like pure gold. I hurt you.. ..but you saved my reputation and also our lives. I'm very sad that I don't have a son like you. I'm so sorry, Vikranth. Sir! A student is not someone who finishes college.. ..and walks away with a TC. He's someone who is willing to take care of others.. ..as long as he's with them. We are all a family, sir. Hello! What are you thinking about? I'm wondering if I should say sorry.. ..for getting you suspended or thanks for saving my friend. I don't want any of those. Just keep smiling like this. No way. You can keep the smiles, I want a party. Okay, I'll give you a grand party. Will you ask me to pay the bill at the end? Don't worry about that at all. Because it is Anagha's cousin's engagement party. Please come. Okay. (Music) "Anagha! Anagha! I dreamt about you" "Anagha! Anagha! I'm with you" "I wonder how it happened" "You became a part of me" "Paradise just dropped to the earth" "It came to me like a smile" "It is like the waves from a sea of joy" "It drenched me in and out" (Music) "I met you after a long wait" "It is like I'm standing beside a miracle" "I'm living a hundred years in this one moment" "Should I give a new name to the joy inside my heart?" "Paradise just dropped to the earth" "It came to me like a smile" "It is like the waves from a sea of joy" Where are you taking me? Are you kidnapping me? - "It drenched me in and out" Wait and see. What is this? Where are we? You'll find out. Huh? - Come. Come. Be careful. Wow, Vikranth! This is so beautiful. Did you know about this place before? Where are we? Switch on the GPS on your phone and see for yourself. GPS? Okay. Unknown island. This is a nameless island. It is very beautiful. So you discovered this place like Columbus. (Laughs) What are you doing, Vicky? Hmm. Sir! (Laughs) Anagha Island. Anagha, do you know how much I love you? As deep as this sea. As vast as the skies. As much as the joy that is racing in my heart. I love you, Anagha. I love you too. (Music) "I've put together words while thinking about you.." "..and it came to you in the form of a love poem" "I breathed in fresh air while hearing your name.." "..and it turned into life that is flowing in me" "Paradise just dropped to the earth" "It came to me like a smile" "It is like the waves from a sea of joy" "It drenched me in and out" Stick them to the walls. You go that side. You go this side. Don't leave any space on the walls. Stick them properly. Okay, sir. Come on. - Hey, wait. I'm scared, Vikranth. Please, I can't come. Hey, you have nothing to be scared of. Mom and dad are very jovial persons. You'll understand it when you meet them. I'm with you. Come on. Yes! - We finished first! We finished first! - We finished first! Vicky! We finished first, didn't we? Yes, Mom. We finished first. You tell me, dear. Didn't we finish first? We are first. No, we are first. We are first. We are first. No, we are first. We are first. We are first. We are first. Mom, she is Anagha.. She is your classmate. You like her very much. She likes you too. You both are in love. Is that right? Wait, let him say what he.. Yes, Mom. That's what I wanted to say.. Then listen carefully to me. I've raised my son with a lot of love and affection.. ..and I've some expectations from his future wife. Mom, she'll be better than your expectations. Okay, then. I'll ask her 3 questions. If she gives me right answers, I'll accept her. You'll play the question game in this serious situation? I'm okay with it, Auntie. First question. I want coffee. Shekhar wants tea. What will you make first? First I'll boil the milk, Auntie. Second question. You are traveling through a dense forest in a car. It is raining heavily. You have only one place in your car. Shekhar, Vikranth and I'll be waiting to catch a ride. Who will you take in your car? We'll give the car to you two and.. ..we both will come walking, Auntie. Superb. Third question. They say that a mother wants to satisfy her son's hunger.. ..but a wife is more interested in his wallet. But what is of interest to both mother in law.. ..and daughter in law? Time.. TV serials, Auntie. Superb, son. (Laughs) Don't mind me, dear. If we are not smart.. ..it is very difficult to control them. Come with me. Your taste is superb, son. She's very beautiful. (Vase shatters) Anagha! How did it fall? I told you not to keep it there. She could've been badly hurt. Mom, I'll drop Anagha home. Okay, son. Go safely. (Sniffs) (Crying) What is the MLA's condition? Very serious, sir. It can be a big conspiracy. They used a very dangerous poison. It has a name too. Anthrax. Put the city on high alert. Do you think the poisoning is a political conspiracy? What is your reaction on this as the Health Minister? This is a very serious situation. We are investigating the case from all angles. The culprits will be punished no matter who they are. Brother! Brother! - Yes? We've to kill someone right now. - What happened? We've to kill him! That's it! - Sit down. A guy hit me in the college. We've to kill him. I have very high hopes for you.. ..but you are determined to be a common citizen. Don't worry. Give his details to our men. They will take care of him. Go to Mumbai and give them these documents and the file. I'll take care of the rest. He shouldn't be alive when I come back. Oh dear, how will he live in the future? (Temple bell ring) Why are you in such a hurry, Grandma? Don't worry. God won't run away. Everyone knows that God won't run away. That's why all the temples are empty.. ..but pubs and clubs are fully packed. Hurry up. It is time for the special prayers. - Hmm. (Sanskrit chants) Priest, offer special prayers on her name. What are you doing here? You can't walk away in the middle of a prayer. Let's go. Grandma! I'll be right back. Stay here. Okay? Where are you going? Priest! Yes, dear? What prayer did you perform just now? It is not a prayer, dear. It is a ritual related to death. Oh. It must've been for their parents. No, dear. It was for their only son Vikranth. What? What did you say his name is? Vikranth. Boo! What's the matter? Anything wrong? I'll ask you a question. Will you give me an honest answer? Ask me. Are your parents your real parents? No, Anagha. Then? During the Godavari Temple Fair last year.. ..I found them lost and crying, so I brought them home. (Laughs) Vikranth! - (Laughs) Vikranth, stop it! Vikranth, please. Vikranth.. Vikranth, stop it! It is a serious question, so don't joke about it. I'm not joking. Your question is a joke. I saw your mom and dad in the temple half an hour ago. They..They did a death ritual on your name. Hey, are you mad? Did you lose it? I didn't lose it. You've lost it. You are blinded by your love for your parents. I suspected it when the flower pot fell down in your house. Your mom is not an ordinary woman. She is wicked. (Slaps) I won't tolerate it if you talk against them. They are like Gods to me. I love them more than my life. What about me? Anagha, please. Think with a cool head. Won't they tell me if they are going to the temple? And why will they do a death ritual on my name? That sounds so disgusting. Maybe you were mistaken. Something is definitely not adding up. I'm really sorry. Please come out of it. Thank you for understanding me so well. I'm sorry. Remember one thing. I'm not crazy, Vikranth. My eyes will never deceive me. Only God knows the truth. What's the matter? Why are you home so early? You said you are going out with your friends. I came home a while ago. Nobody was at home. Where did you both go? Your dad's friend Subbarao met with an accident. So we went to the hospital to see him. All these accidents. I'm scared to go out of the house. Is that so? What happened to him? His leg got injured. They put him in a cast. He can't walk for at least one month. Anyway, go call your dad. I'll serve food for you both. Hmm. Sorry, buddy. I can't come out today. I told you I've to go out with my son. I've to spend time with him. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay? When did you come home? I'm waiting for you. Where were you all morning? My colleague Subbarao met with an accident.. ..so we went to the hospital to see him. Nothing serious. Just a small hair-line fracture in his hand. He'll be okay. I'm very hungry. Let's go eat food. You go ahead. I'll come in a minute. - Come soon. Mumbai Brother, I finished the job. I'm coming home. Do you remember what I told you? I remember. Okay. - Leave it to me. Bye. Hey, stop! Stop! Missing? 1,000,000 rupees reward for catching him? What the! There is definitely a mystery behind you. (Brakes squeal) (Door knocks) We don't need anything, son. Sir! I'm not here to sell any products. Who do you want to meet? The people in the photo are my mom and dad. Based on the serial number behind the photo.. ..can you give me the date and other details.. Look, son! I shut down the studio 10 years ago. I don't have any information. Bye, son. Sir! Stop! Are you the one that called? - Yes. Come with me. (Thundering) Come here. Wipe yourself. What do you want? I want the details of this photo, sir. Do you at least know the year they got married? I was born in 1995. So it may be 94 or 93. I'll try to find it. Sit down. Okay, sir. Tell me. Where is he? Who are you? Why do you want him? You'll pay 1,000,000 for him? Hey! 10 million! 10 million rupees! Don't talk too much. Just tell me where he is. His name is Vikranth. Boss. Leave me, Boss. Leave me, Boss. (Phone rings) (Laughs) (Phone rings) Boss, we found him. (Gunshot) They found him! (Gunshot) Kill him! Tell me the truth! Who are you? How do you know them? They are really my parents, sir. You can check my driving license if you want to. Where did you get that fake license from? Fake license? Of course. You said he is your father. Yes. - You said you were born in 1995. If you were really born in 1995.. ..how did I take their wedding photos in 1997? Did your parents get married.. ..two years after you were born? They are not your parents. Get out of here. Or I'll have to call the police. Get out! I've seen many guys like you that stage such dramas.. ..to get their hands on others' wealth and property. Get out! (Music) "Did anybody see the skies breaking apart?" "Can you hear the sound of a breaking heart?" "When the sweet memories of the past stab you.." "..can you see the proof in a broken heart?" "Is my mom's loving morsel just a lie?" "Is my sleeping on my dad's chest just a dream?" "Is this how the lovely moon really looks?" "Is this the other face of the truth?" "A smile turned out to be a hidden desert land" "Love turned out to be just a shadow behind the stars" "How can I have any faith in my parents?" "Is the sea flowing out of my eyes like tears?" (Door knocks) (Door knocks) (Door knocks) - Finally he's home. Auntie, is Vikranth home? Vikranth is not home.. Vikranth? I don't know. You got the wrong address. What are you doing? Tell me! Where is he? Hey! (Gunshot) (Gunshot) Mom! Mom! (Crying) Mom! (Crying) Mom! Daddy! Daddy! What happened, Daddy? What is going on? Son.. Wait a minute. Let me tell you a truth before I die. We can talk later. Let's go to the hospital first, Daddy. Listen to me. We don't have much time. You are not our real son. Who am I, Daddy? Your life is in danger. Leave this place immediately. Please, son. Listen to me. You'll find out everything later. First leave. Don't ask me to go, Daddy. Please. I love you, son. (Crying) Daddy.. - I love you.. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! (Crying) (Vehicle approaching) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) Faster! Faster! (Gunshot) Faster! Faster! (Tires squealing) He escaped! (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Jeep rammed) Is it? Impossible! Just few hours back.. ..when our men went to verify the mass murders.. ..that happened in a house in Madhurawada.. ..they recognized the symbol 'J' on one of the bodies there. They confirmed that it is Ansari's body and informed us. Ansari's dead body found in Vizag? Ansari is not just Jehangir's main man.. ..the Interpol issued a Red Corner notice on him. Who did you say that area's inspector is? One location. Four bullets. Six dead bodies. Eight stab wounds. But only one solution. This hair. That is your hair, sir. Mine? Yes, sir. How do you know that? I was removing it from your shirt.. ..but you grabbed it from my hand. Is this that hair? - Yes, sir. Sir! NIA officer from Hyderabad is coming to handle this case. They asked you to assist him. Why are they sending a NIA officer for such a small case? How long.. Sir! Are you handling this case? Nobody else will be able to handle it, sir. What are your observations on this case? Did you find any clues? Sir! I solve the case as soon as I see the crime scene. This is a piece of cake. Just some family problems. Around 15 guys came and killed the whole family. We'll catch them in two or three months. Not around 15 men, just four or five men. One member of this family is missing. First we've to find him. This room is like a science-fiction movie set. I don't understand this room at all. Black belt in karate. District champion in boxing. Hidden weapons all around the house. Looks like they anticipated this attack. The house that they lived in and the lifestyle they had.. ..are totally different. Something fishy. Tech-guy. Not an ordinary man. King of mischief. Send the bodies for post-mortem. Send the reports to my office. - Okay, sir. What a horrible death, my brother! I'm responsible for your early demise. You wouldn't be dead if I had killed him that day. I won't spare him. I want him. I want him! Who? Durga. A local MLA, sir. Where were you? What were you doing? I give you four hours time. Arrest that guy. Otherwise the whole state will be in chaos. The dead body will be here until you catch him. Keep the dead body down. Keep it down. We are doing our job. Send the body to post-mortem. Okay, sir. Who are you? Do you know who I am? I have 300,000 supporters. Let me see who will stop me. When I find my brother's killer I'll shoot him right there. You may have thousands of supporters.. ..but I'm responsible for 1.2 billion people. Take the body. Find him. We have to find him first. Who are you all? Why did you come into my life? Why did they mercilessly kill my parents? Why did you act like a crazy man all these days? Who are you all? Who am I? I'm not a mad man. I'm your guardian. Your servant to keep an eye on you 24/7. They were not your real parents. You were not their blood. Malathi Devi and Chandra Shekhar.. ..who you thought were your parents all these years.. ..were the most wanted Naxal leaders in the past. You are not Vikranth, son of Chandra Shekhar Pasupuleti. You are Vikranth, son of Vikram Simha Uggiraala. Good evening! In the Mumbai bomb blasts case.. ..the police arrested the main suspect Ayub.. ..and two others with him this morning. You already know that 250 people were cruelly killed.. ..in the recent bomb blasts. The accused were taken to Yerawada Jail in Pune. The police said that Ayub is Mumbai underworld don.. ..Jehangir's brother and the heir of his criminal empire. I told him not to go out in public. Did he listen to me? What happened now? They should be out before Jehangir sir comes to India. Otherwise he'll kill me. They are not in their in-laws' house. They are in Central Jail. What do we do now? Nobody can save them unless they escape from jail. Hey! Hey! Oh no! (Keys jangle) Hello, brothers! (Snaps finger) Here! Do you know what a giant wheel is? I think you know. I'm sure you took a ride on it as kids. This jail is just like that. Once you come in.. ..you can go out only when I send you out. You can't leave in between. You'll die. (Whistles) Mind it! Stop it! Surrender yourself or I'll shoot you! Hey! Don't come near. Throw the gun. Or I'll kill him. I don't care what happens to me, sir. It is very dangerous for men like him to get out of jail. Shoot him. (Gunshot) Shekhar, are you okay? - Okay, sir. Take him to the hospital. Shekhar? Don't worry about him, sir. I will take care of him. Thank you. Thank you so much, sir. Home Minister. You are not an ordinary man. You are coolly sitting here.. ..after shooting that criminal on the spot. But be careful. Your enemy is Jehangir. You'll be alright because you are from a landlord's family. If they find that Naxalite, they won't spare him. That's why I'm sending him to a secret location. Okay. Good morning, sir. - Yes, please come. You'll live a hundred years. We were just talking about you. Sir! This is my friend Chakrapani. IG. Hello! - Hello, sir! Are you Shekhar? Mr. Chandra Shekhar Azad. In his college days, he was influenced by.. ..revolutionary ideas, so he joined a squad.. ..chose non-violence instead of violence and rose as a leader. And Malathi Devi. Martial arts trainer. Sharp shooter. She trained about 30 squads. After the movement got side-tracked.. ..they couldn't be a part of it, they surrendered themselves. Don't be surprised, sir. That is our sir's talent. He has everybody's bio-data in his mind. Subbu's bio-data is also one of the bio-data's in his brain. Yes, madam. I came here as a prisoner when I was a kid. He taught me what life is and showed me the right path.. ..and made a good man out of me. He's my God and I'm his dog. Hey, shut up. (Laughs) We thought we'll be in jail all our lives. But you helped us to be free once again. You gave us and our child a new life. We'll be forever indebted to you.. Educate that little boy and give him a good life. That's enough for me. Tomorrow is my son's birthday. You are going far away. I don't know when we'll meet again. Come to my son's birthday party before leaving. Why us, sir? Happily spend time with your family. Shekhar, you are also my family. You are like my brother. You are coming. That's it. Surprise! Surprise! Ten days. I went out of town for just ten days.. ..and you gave me such a big surprise. After hearing my name.. ..15 states spend sleepless nights.. ..4 countries quake with fear.. ..2,000 men wake up in their sleep and salute me. But I could not save my only brother. They shot him down like a dog. Who planned to bring him out of jail without my knowledge? Who is it? Who? (Gunshot) Surprise! I want the head of my brother's murderer.. ..by tomorrow morning. Who will bring it? I'll bring it. I'll bring his head, Father. I'll kill the man that killed uncle. Bravo, my son! You are a tiger born to a tiger! The celebration in his house should turn into wailing. Go, son. Make me proud. Go. (Camera clicks) (Camera clicks) Madam, cake. You'll die, you rascal. Something is fishy. Hey, wait. What did you just say? (Bomb timer beep) Hey, stop! (Bomb timer beep) Who are you? What did you just say? (Laughs) (Bomb timer beep) Cake! (Bomb timer beep) (Bomb explosion) (Crying) Mr. Vikram Simha? 90 percent burns. Condition is very critical. Will you please promise me something? Promise me that you'll keep him away from all this. I swear on our love. I won't let any harm come to him. Seetha! (Crying) Vikram Simha! A call for you. Surprise! Surprise! (Laughs) Look what a small bullet cost you. Poor man, you lost your wife. Now take care of your son. Your son is in my hands. I'll hang him to death, put you behind the bars.. ..and make you eat jail food. Otherwise I won't be called Vikram Simha Uggiraala. I'm a forest and you are a blade of grass. It doesn't matter how dense the forest is.. ..a small matchstick can ruin it. Touch my son if you have the guts. Your ruination will start today. Count your time. (Snaps finger) Have you lost it? You have a small son. Won't you think about him? Shekhar, your son is not dead. He is your son from today. I'll stay away from him from today. Subbu will be with you to help you. Please leave. Leave. Subbu! What is this, sir? Take care of them. Okay, sir. After hearing the arguments of the case.. ..since there is no substantial evidence against him.. ..the court finds the accused Iqbal not guilty. The court gives a warning to the police.. ..for arresting an innocent 16 year old boy in this case.. ..and orders them to find the actual culprits. Sorry, sir. (Brakes squeal) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Explosion) My dear boy.. Sir, we searched everywhere. We found this photo, but no whereabouts of the kid. What a surprise! Search. Search every inch. Search the whole country. I want him. Their souls will not rest in peace.. ..until I smear his blood on their graves. Find him. Jehangir still wants to exact revenge after 18 years. He is still searching for you. He is holding your childhood photo.. ..imagining how you will look in your adulthood.. ..and frantically searching the whole country. He has killed men that looked like you. He will find you. Take this passport. There are four visas inside. Take those ATM cards. Use as much money as you want. That's your money. Go where Jehangir can't find you. Take my advice. What? I should run away? What if he finds me there? Should I run again? Again and again. How far? My parents breathed their last in these hands. He has turned my life upside down in one day. My dad didn't raise me to be a coward. He raised me like a soldier. He taught me to fight. I won't spare him. I won't. I won't run away. I will make him run. I will make him curse the day he messed with me. (Snaps finger) I will show him what happens when a naughty boy.. ..turns into a nuclear bomb. I don't know who that Vikram Simha is. I don't need to know. I'm Vikranth, son of Chandra Shekhar Pasupuleti. Vikranth, don't think of going against him all alone. Listen to me. You have known me since I was a little kid. Is this what you think of me? You were with me for so long to keep one promise. You protected me with your life. Don't you understand me at all? You want me to get scared and run away. All these years he has been hiding in a hole like a rat. That's why nobody could find him. But now he has to come out for me. He has to. I'm a trap for him. If you still think that I'm being foolish.. ..take those cards and leave this city. Otherwise stay with me and support me. Can I call you uncle? I'll tell you everything I know about Jehangir. You and your friends should be very careful. He is not a human. He is a tiger seeking blood. Leave me! Let me go! I'll never do what you want! (Grunts) Surprise! Why do you do only half the job? I did everything I could as you said. I can't do anything else. You didn't do what we want. When I used a sample of that powder in Hyderabad.. ..not even 100 people died. I need more dangerous, more lethal, more powerful. Aren't you ashamed to work for Pakistani dogs.. ..being an Indian? Hey, please surprise him. Surprise him. (Laughs) (Screams) Who wants the next surprise? Don't kill us. Don't kill us. We will do as you say. We'll create what you want. What will you make? The most dangerous of bio-weapons. Botulinum Toxin. Wow! Botulinum Toxin! I want that! (Gunshot) Jehangir Kazgar. None of us need an introduction. He holds the second place in.. ..World's Ten Most Wanted Criminals. He is the main accused in serial bomb blasts in 1995. Ever since he lost his brother in 1997.. ..while he was escaping from jail and.. ..lost his son in an accident.. ..he has been careful to hide his existence.. ..and expanded his criminal empire. According to the intelligence from.. ..the United States Treasury Department.. ..we came to know that he is in good terms.. ..with some terrorist groups in Pakistan. He has been deceiving many countries for so long.. ..but he has been spotted in Vizag recently. Do you think Jehangir has connections with Ansari.. ..whose body was found in Vizag? Yes. This might sound like a strange story. After killing Jehangir's brother and son in 1998.. ..Jail Superintendent Vikram Simha.. ..lost his life too in the same incident. His son Vikranth and the son of Chandra Shekhar.. ..and Malathi Devi who were killed in Vizag, are one. Jehangir must have attacked that youth's house.. ..with the intention of exacting revenge. Since Vikranth's body was not found.. ..maybe he was kidnapped. No. He is not an innocent youth as we think. He is very good at using technology. We don't know how he escaped from this attack. But we have evidence that somebody helped him. The night that incident took place in Vizag.. ..he passed through the toll-gates towards Hyderabad.. ..with another man as shown in the picture. Jehangir and his men will try to find this youth. This is the right time for us. It is very important to find out Jehangir's whereabouts.. ..and it is equally important to protect this youth. Now the questions before us are.. ..Who helped that youth to escape? Where is he now? Find him. Search every nook and corner. Mr. Vittal! - Yes, sir! I want all the details about the dead Vikram Simha. Okay, sir. Be on that mission. Yes, sir! (TV switch on) Hello, Jehangir! Hello! Our men have been waiting for years.. ..for the operation that you'll be doing in India. But you haven't started it yet. My operation is so powerful.. ..that you haven't seen or heard anything like it before. When I use that weapon.. ..not just tens, hundreds or thousands.. ..but millions of people will lose their lives. Surprising? (Laughs) Dr. Khan, please come. Biological weapons. Harmful biological agents. Instead of fighting with guns and bombs.. ..they use bacteria and virus as weapons.. ..and their main goal is to kill countless people at once. One is Botulinum Toxin. Just one gram of it can kill at least 1 to 1.5 million people. With this operation, my name will create history and.. ..and I will have a permanent place in heaven. Bravo, Jehangir! We can stand proudly before God because of you. We will meet you there in a week or ten days. Bye. (Door creak) I miss you so much. I miss you. We got rid of our phones as you said. What's next? Use these from today. Our phones may be tapped. We have to be careful. What do you want to do now? Hunt. I want to hunt. I will hunt down the wild beast that has been in hiding.. ..and bring peace to the souls of my parents. Listen to me, darling. It is not safe here. Go back to your parents. I'll come to you once I get this job done. Being with you is the safest place for me on this earth. My life and death is with you. I can't stay away from you. (Music) "Should I spread my life down so that you can walk on it?" "Should I walk with you with a million hopes?" "I've been born on this earth for you" "I won't leave your side until death takes me away" "Should I spread my life down so that you can walk on it?" "Should I walk with you with a million hopes?" (Music) "My heart condemns me when I'm not with you" "It is constantly filled with your thoughts" "It is my prisoner now, safe with me" "It has filled me abounding joy" "Let me stay with you for a hundred years" "Let me prove to you that I'll give my life for you" "Though I'm surrounded by darkness.." "..your eyes are a lamp for me" "Though sadness overtakes me.." "..your love is a path strewn with flowers" "Should I spread my life down so that you can walk on it?" "Should I walk with you with a million hopes?" (Music) Wow! My Hyderabad! This place smells so good. (Laughs) Did you see how great God is? I've travelled all around the world.. ..but He made me come to Hyderabad.. ..for the two most important works in my life. One is to start our operation. Second is.. Forgive me. Please forgive me. Nobody has ever escaped from me till now. It happened for the first time. Someone is helping him. Someone is helping him. Just give me one more chance. What will you do? I'll take the help of all our men in the market and.. ..find that guy no matter where he's hiding. I'll drag him here and throw him at your feet. (Laughs) I'll wait for your surprise. Hey! Welcome my dear scientists. (Laughs) Consider this your house from today. You have exactly ten days time. Then we'll test one sample. A minimum of 1,000 people should die. Then I will let you go home. Jehangir! Nobody has seen him in the past 15 years.. ..but no matter which country he goes to.. ..he has a big network there. His men are everywhere and they do his work. And the one in Hyderabad is Rasul. Land grabbing, illegal weapons, human trafficking.. ..are his businesses. It took a lot of effort to get a chance to meet him. Who are you? What do you want? Jehangir's details. You are asking me as easily as going to the bank and.. ..asking for new 2,000 rupee notes. Did you see Jehangir's face any time? (Gunshot) (Groans) Don't kill me. Please. Please.. Not just me, nobody knows about him. He gets in touch only when he has some work with us. Who comes to you? Where does he meet? Bikku. Jehangir's main man. Where is he meeting next? Answer me! Will you answer me or no? He'll come to Monda Market next Friday. I don't know anything else. I won't leave until I find him. You are being observed by the NIA. I won't sleep until I kill the man that killed my brother. If you mess this up, you will lose your MLA post.. ..and your life. It is not good to get involved in this matter. Give the job of finding him to someone else. That's right. Elections are coming up. We can't take such risks at this time. I know someone who does such jobs, sir. Who is he? Stop doing petty thieveries and burglaries. So be it. You should be saying okay. Oh, okay. Okay. Here, boss. We have to find him. Just wait. Come on. Give me something. Monda Market. According to this map.. ..there are three ways into the market. If one person can coordinate from this tall building.. ..three of us can guard these three ways. But we've to be very careful. We shouldn't miss him at any cost. Bablu will keep an eye from this building. I'll be at Exit A. Anagha will be at Exit B.. ..and uncle will be at Exit C. No matter which way he uses to enter.. ..it will take us ten minutes to meet up. We should follow him closely in those ten minutes. We all will be connected by a Bluetooth conference call. The police are searching for us. So we should be very careful. Bablu! Are you fully alert? Yes, I'm alert. Okay. Anagha! Uncle! Are you alert? I'm ready. Don't worry about this entrance. As far as I know, he'll avoid this open entrance. Once he enters inside, we'll be onto him. But be attentive. Guys! Enter the Dragon! Are you sure? I'm a bit doubtful. Entrance B, Anagha. Follow the black dress bald man. Anagha, look at his face and confirm. Vikranth, that's Bikku. I'm sure. Listen, be careful. Don't let him see you. Guys, we should not lose him. Bablu, take the bike, come here immediately. I'm coming. On my way. Uncle, we shouldn't lose him at any cost. I'll take care of it. Excuse me. Do you have a lighter? Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! I won't let anything happen to you. Uncle! Uncle! Get up. You'll be alright. Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! (Crying) Uncle.. (Phone rings) Tell me. Buddy, I took all his things from the hospital. But I couldn't find his phone. It is missing. Did you check properly? I checked. I think it got lost in the market. In the market? Oh crap! Something is wrong. Anagha, come fast. - What happened, Vicky? This place is not safe for us. What's wrong? - Hurry up. (Door knocks) (Door knocks) (Door knocks) (Door knocks) (Gasps) (Door knocks) Go, go, go. Vicky, be careful. - Go, go, go. Don't come out until I call you. (Gunshot) (Phone rings) Unknown number? Why aren't you answering your phone? Did you get drunk and go to sleep? Hey! He didn't go to sleep, I put him to sleep. Surprised? I'm sure you recognized me. Vikranth. Enemy of Jehangir Kazgar. Wow, what a surprise. You've outdone your father. The account that your father opened 18 years ago.. ..will close with your death. Hey! Hey! We haven't settled the balance in that account yet. That will be settled with your death. You are a kid. Try to save your life. Run away. Jehangir, I'm not an innocent college kid. My father raised me to be an invincible warrior. Your time starts now. Count your last minutes. (Snaps finger) Why did you put the GPS in his mouth? Now we can control his every move. Yes, sir. I need you to go to Kerala immediately. Just follow my instructions. Okay? Okay, sir. - Come on, go ahead. We are going to reach our goal in one week. We have to be very careful. The NIA, CID, Task Force, Octopus.. ..are trying very hard to find us. It is your duty to make sure that our leaders.. ..coming from Pakistan won't face any inconveniences. Wow! (Laughs) What a pleasant surprise! I have been feeding you for years for this very task. He is just a kid who doesn't even have a moustache yet.. ..and you let him escape. There's only one punishment for it. (Gunshot) (Laughs) What an ultimate surprise for me! (Laughs) Bury him behind the bungalow. Call Anthony! Come on, Anthony! Banjara Hills! Where did we come? Oh no! What is this place? Looks like a forest. Is that man a Naxalite? The GPS is pointing to this place. Something is fishy. I think someone is coming. Let's hide. Come. Come on. A security point in such a remote location? I'm sure he's inside. You both stay in the van till I come back. Take care. Okay. (Horn blares) Open the gate! (Brakes squeal) Hello, sir! Welcome to India. Jehangir! We are happy to meet you. (Laughs) All our brothers in the world are looking to you. Everyone is talking about the operation. (Laughs) Thank you. Thank you. In exactly one week.. ..the bio-chemical gas that we are making.. ..will spread in the air to turn this country into a graveyard. (Laughs) Very good. We arranged two Bollywood stars to entertain you. Bollywood stars? - Two Bollywood stars? Who? - It's a surprise! (Music) "Come on!" (Music) "Oh no! He's calling me" "Naughty man! Naughty man!" "Oh no! I don't know what to do" "Naughty man! Naughty man!" "He doesn't leave when I ask him to" "He is filled with mischievous thoughts" "He says he likes my smile" "But he doesn't care about my good qualities" "Hey! Hey, Mister! Hug me tightly" "Hey! Hey, Mister! Kill me sweetly" (Music) "Why do you look at me like that?" "Will you come to me?" "Why are you running in a hurry?" "Will you shut the doors?" "Ready the love car, let's speed it up" "Show me you strength, be naughty with me" "Let's feed each other with kisses" "Let's satisfy our raging lust with this sweetness" "Hey! Hey, Mister! Hug me tightly" "Hey! Hey, Mister! Tackle with me sweetly" (Music) "You can't buy this happiness with money" "Your manliness gives me the utmost pleasure" "Let's wage a war until one of us comes out victorious" "Let's blow a victory trumpet together" "Taking things slowly is not my thing" "Come to me like a crashing wave" "I'll welcome the eagerness in you" "Take me on a pleasure ride" "Hey! Hey, Mister! Bite me hotly" "Hey! Hey, Mister! Kill me sweetly" (Music) Buddy, what happened? We have to leave this place immediately. I'll explain everything later. Let's go. Oh no! What are the police and government doing? He can't do this without their support. He's planning to use this bio-chemical weapon in 4 days. It is useless to tell the police about it. It might spook him off and he will be extra careful. I wanted to exact revenge for killing my parents. But he's planning to kill many more parents. Others might spare his life, I won't. We need support to stop his barbarism. Subbu gave us some cards that day, didn't he? Here you go, there's a bank manager's visiting card. He'll definitely help us if we meet him. Okay. I'll go to the bank and meet the manager.. ..to see if he can help us. You both be careful. Hello! Vikranth just entered Everest Bank in Madhapur. What? He's Everest Bank, sir. I'm starting immediately. Ask that area's CI to join me. Do you remember what I told you? Yes, boss. What will you say after going inside? Hats off! Not hats off! Say hands up! Got it, boss! We should go in, switch off the CCTV camera.. ..and catch that youth. Then you'll come in, right? Exactly. If you do it correctly, you'll be well settled in your life. (Snaps finger) Go ahead. - Okay, boss. Come here. - Yes, boss? Why are you standing in the line? Do you think we are here to do a fixed deposit? No, boss. That youth is in the bank manager's room. We thought we'll apply for a credit card.. ..instead of wasting time until he comes out. Since the CCTV cameras are too high.. ..we couldn't cut the wires. - (Slaps) Hands up! All of you lie down on the floor! Why are you lying down? You asked everyone to lie down on the floor, boss. I didn't mean you. Not the ones with the masks. Oh, not us. Why did you stand? You said not the ones with the masks. I meant everyone except the ones with guns. Why did you stand? You said everyone except the ones with guns. I have a gun. Why do you need a gun at this age? I didn't mean everyone with guns. I meant the thieves that rob the bank. I beg of you. Why are you torturing me this way? (Gunshot) Who are you? Li. Bali. Kabali. (Slaps) Sir! Sir, he's inside. Move aside! Boss, he slapped you. Hold this. (Slaps) He didn't slap me. He just swatted a fly. There's too much competition here. (Door knocks) Sir! No, no. (Door knocks) Vikranth, come out. We are not a threat. We know everything that happened. In fact, we are here to save you. Vikranth, listen to me. Come out. We are not your foes. We are your friends. Please trust me. How can I trust you? Do you think we can't catch you if we want? I have to discuss something with you. Please come out. Tell me. What do you want from me? Why are you after me? Who saved you that day? Where were you all these days? What did you do? What are your plans? I won't ask you any of those questions. But your life is in danger now. You need our security. Your security? Where was your security when my parents were killed? I know how to protect myself. Let me go. I've to go. You can't go. Forget about any revenge dramas you have in mind. Sir, a call for you. Tell me, Vittal. You were right, sir. My God! Okay. Where is he? I want him. Where is he? Look! I won't say this again. Law has its own procedures. Sir! You just enforce the law, we make the law. We are rule makers and rule breakers too. I want him for ten minutes. You need to leave in five minutes. (Phone rings) That's for you. Without a doubt it is for you. - (Phone rings) (Phone rings) Hello! Good afternoon, sir. Okay, sir. Ten minutes only. Love you, my boy. I didn't kill your brother. I know. I know that the ones who killed my brother.. ..killed your parents too. I also know that even if I spare them, you won't. Kill those rascals. I will give you any help you want. Any help? Hundred percent. (Gun cocks) Just let me go. Otherwise I'll kill this MLA. You fools! Throw your guns! Otherwise he'll kill me! Vikranth, don't be foolish. I'm saying this for your welfare. I don't care about my welfare. Don't you care about your father too? I mean, Vikram Simha. Your father is not dead, he's alive. I know that you won't believe me. Two years before Vikram Simha died in an accident.. ..he got injured in a shooting. Our records say that there is a steel rod in his right leg. But the post-mortem report of his body.. ..has no evidence of that rod. Further investigation revealed the whole story. Vikram Simha's college education.. ..and police training took place in Kerala. I sent my men there for an investigation. My suspicions were right. My men found out that your father has been living there.. ..in a farmhouse all these years. He might've escaped before my men reached there. You can say these fairytales to little children. They will laugh and clap for you. Hey, move! Move! Move! Vikranth! Vikranth! - Hey! Hey! No! Who do you want? Hey! (Gunshot) (Phone rings) Hello! Vicky! - Yes? Where are you? Almost reaching home. What happened? Are you okay? Somebody shot me and took Anagha. What? Oh my God! I'm coming there. I'm fine. Don't worry about me. But Anagha.. Hey, I saw Anagha. Take care. - (Horn blares) Call out to him now. Where is he? You'll die if he comes here. (Laughs) His father will have to come down to kill me. You are.. Anagha! Are you okay? Yeah. - Nothing happened to you, right? Let's go. Come on. Vikranth, wait a minute. He saved me. But do you know who he is? Huh? Your father, Vikram Simha. Anyone can become a father by giving birth.. ..but not everyone deserves to be called a Dad. My Dad is dead. Let's go. I thought you were a smart man. But now I realized that you think like a fool. What should I know about him? That he washed his hands off of me before I could speak? That he fooled the world into thinking that he is dead.. ..and hid somewhere to save his own life? Stop it, Vikranth! Just stop it, for God's sake! He is the greatest father in this world. What did you say? He washed his hands off of you? He sacrificed his whole life to save your life. He knew that those rascals will hurt you if they find you.. ..so he stayed far away from you all these years. Even though he couldn't see his son growing up.. ..he was with you in spirit and gave you a wonderful life. He knows your every move. He was behind every step you took. You are the son of a normal PET working in a college. Did you ever think about how you have this lifestyle.. ..where you can buy anything you want? It is because of him. Every son sees his father as a hero. But you view him as a villain. What can any father give his son? Only confidence in his future. In order to give you that bright future.. ..he burnt himself like a candle. Dad! I may not have raised you from childhood. I may not have been a friend to give you advice. But I've protected you every minute like a bodyguard. Forgive me, Dad. I was very wrong. I didn't realize that I've such an amazing father. You sacrificed your whole life for me. If I had known this.. Whatever I did for you as a father, it was my duty. But whatever you do as my son, it is my blessing. Live as you want. Do what you want to. But before you take a step in your life, think it through. I'll take care of this mess. You leave. Then you also think it through before taking a step. Because I'll be following your footsteps from now on. I'll make Jehangir pay for separating us. I saw him, Dad. He is in Hyderabad. Really? Tell me where he is. I can't sleep until I kill him. No, Dad. It is not just about our revenge now. He has joined hands with terrorists.. ..and is planning to kill millions of families like us. He is making a dangerous biological weapon. We have just two days time. We have to stop it. He's in the palace that is in the city outskirts. He'll be half-dead if we ruin that place. I've a weapon that can stop him. Are you wondering how he is related to Jehangir? He's Jehangir's son. (Gunshot) (Explosion) My God! You had him all these years? I expected that Jehangir will find you one day. If he dares to touch you, this fellow will lose his life. I have another idea. But first let's go from here. Come. A sample of the dangerous virus you asked for. Now India will become a mass grave. (Ambulance siren wails) Is it? We need your support, sir. All permissions are granted. Thank you, sir. Don't worry about protocols. Just go and get him. (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) Vikranth! Enemy of Jehangir Kazgar. Count your last minutes. (Snaps finger) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Bottle shatters) (Machine beeps) You? (Machine beeps) (Police siren wails) Let's move. You leave now. I'll take care of it. Thank you, sir. At least now you understand me. It's okay. The man that terrorized the country.. ..Jehangir Kazgar is dead. He was killed by our police in a secret operation yesterday. He created a dangerous and life-threatening virus. We stopped it before it could spread to the whole nation. We arrested all his followers. Now all the citizens can be in peace. The story of a ruthless beast ended today. I'm Pravin Prakash. - Hello, sir! Is Jehangir's post-mortem report ready? It is ready, sir. Pen. Look your son last time. (Laughs) - (Car engine starts) Brilliant. (Explosion) I'll put you behind the bars and make you eat jail food. Otherwise I won't be called Vikram Simha Uggiraala. "Come on!" "Oh no! He's calling me" "Naughty man! Naughty man!" "Oh no! I don't know what to do" "Naughty man! Naughty man!" "He doesn't leave when I ask him to" "He is filled with mischievous thoughts" "He says he likes my smile" "But he doesn't care about my good qualities" "Hey! Hey, Mister! Hug me tightly" "Hey! Hey, Mister! Kill me sweetly" "Why do you look at me like that?" "Will you come to me?" "Why are you running in a hurry?" "Will you shut the doors?" "Ready the love car, let's speed it up" "Show me you strength, be naughty with me" "Let's feed each other with kisses" "Let's satisfy our raging lust with this sweetness" "Let's feed each other with kisses" "Let's satisfy our raging lust with this sweetness" "Hey! Hey, Mister! Hug me tightly" "Hey! Hey, Mister! Tackle with me sweetly"
