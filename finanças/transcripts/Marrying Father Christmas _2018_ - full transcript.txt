â™ª Great, great. I will have all the Christmas decorations in your office before you know it. No one is going to recognize this place when they come in tomorrow. Wow. It's gonna be beautiful. Well, Christmas is kind of my specialty. I wish we had known about you last year. Oh, I haven't been in Boston that long. I moved from Seattle just after last Christmas to start my own interior design company. That's a long way to come. Well, that wasn't the only reason. Oh, no? No. Uh, I found out that I had family in Vermont. [ding] But it wasn't just spending time with my family over Christmas that made it so wonderful. I met someone. Someone very special. Something tells me he felt the same way about you. Before I met Ian, I spent most of my life trying to avoid the holiday hoopla but he made me believe in Christmas again. We had fallen in love at Christmas so it just seemed right for us to get engaged then, too. He proposed? At Christmas? Mmmhmm. That's so romantic. We rode up on a horse-drawn carriage to a gazebo shining with Christmas lights. So when are you getting married? Christmas Day. Oh my gosh, that's perfect. And the greatest part of the story is it's just getting started. [phone rings] I was just thinking about you. Hey, I'm still trying to find a gift for your folks. Any ideas? Hey, remember what they said. "This wedding is all we want for Christmas." I know, but I'd still like to thank them for letting us have the wedding dinner at the inn. Are you kidding? They've absolutely loved helping us make all our plans. I know. They're so sweet. So when're you heading back? I just have a few things to wrap up at the office tomorrow morning. Uh- huh. And then you're coming home? Ian, I've barely been gone a week. Doesn't mean I can't miss you. And then I'm coming home. I love you. I love you, too. Oh, Ian, good. Do you know when Miranda plans on going back to Boston for her final dress fitting? She's still in Boston, mom. But do you know when her final dress fitting is? It is so sweet, she asked me to go with her and Margaret. But I still have to schedule the wedding cake delivery. Right. Ok, uh, I can be here for that then. Like you won't have enough to do? You worry too much, mom. Trust me, this wedding's gonna be great. That's exactly what your father said on our wedding day. Just before the roof in the church started to leak. Oh. As I recall it was more like a downpour than a leak. [laughs] And when everyone was running around looking for a mop and a bucket my husband to be got a big grin on his face. Could you blame me? If the wedding was that much fun I couldn't wait for the marriage to start. [laughs] [phone buzzes] Hi, Margaret. Hello, Miranda. I know that you're busy, I hope that I'm not interrupting. Not at all, no. I just had some wonderful news. What is it? Well, you remember I spoke to you about Yvonne and Amelia Williams, they were very close to your father. Sure, sure. They're lovely people. I am so delighted, they would love to come to the wedding. Oh. Really? I know that I should have spoken to you about this but... well, I hope you understand, they cared so much about your father and when they heard that he had a daughter they- well, and you're such an important part of this family, they said they couldn't wait to meet you. Thank you, that's really wonderful. Miranda. When you and I met two years ago there's no way we could have known that... there... there was no way we could have known that... that I would never be able to write my own wedding vows. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. Um, I'm looking for Miranda Chester. I'm Miranda. Hi. Hi. My name's Charles Finley. I don't have an appointment, I'm afraid. That's ok, but I'm- I'm not actually here today. I'm- I'm sorry? I just mean I'm only here to wrap up a few things and then I'm leaving until after the holidays. Right. Oh, you're getting married. I am, yes. Christmas day. Wow. Um, congratulations. Thank you. So then I guess you're not taking on any new office decorating clients today. I'm not, no. But let me take down your contact information and then I can get back to you- Uh, no. Don't worry, I'll get back in touch with you. Ok. Yeah. What are you doing here? I thought I'd wait so I could, you know, be the first to welcome you back. So, how long have you been waiting? Not long, just a couple of days. Totally worth it. Oh, you! Coming, I'm coming! Ah, there she is! Hi! Hello, Miranda. Hi, Ellie. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Everything looks so beautiful. Oh, thank you. Hello, Ian. We have our girl back for another Christmas. And you know what they say. Third time's the charm. Well, it certainly is for you two. Hi Aunt Miranda! Oooh! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. You guys must have been very busy while I was in Boston this time. Do you like the tree? I think it's the best one yet. It's amazing. Miranda, I've been practicing how to throw the petals when I'm the flower girl at your wedding. Really? That's great. It's a very important job, you know. But I'm the ring bearer. You can't have a wedding without the rings. Mmm-mmm. That's right, buddy. You know, I was a ring bearer when I was about your age. Really? Mmmhmm. If you have any questions just ask away. Thanks, Ian. [laughs] Ok, I'm gonna go put these things in my room. I'll come with you. I'll get the rest of your things from the car. Oh, here you go. Oh, you put up all the Christmas decorations. Well, we love having you for the holidays. But fair warning, we're gonna have to make the most of it this year because next year you're gonna be in your own home for Christmas. I know, I can hardly believe it. The first day that we met did you ever imagine things would turn out this way? Well, when you fall in love at Christmas I can't imagine things turning out any other way. [laughs] Thank you, Pastor Wayland, for performing our ceremony. We really appreciate you taking time out of your Christmas to marry us on Christmas day. My pleasure, Miranda. Now that we have this chance to talk, just the two of us, I've known Ian and his family for years. I'd like to get to know you a little better. Well, that sounds great. You know, Margaret and I have known each other forever. As a matter of fact I married her son Peter to his wife, Ellie. She told me. So you've known Margaret a very long time. You must have known her husband, James. I knew your father very well, yes. Sorry. I guess I'm still just getting used to the idea of people knowing I was his daughter. Well, I can assure you Margaret is making sure everyone knows. I'm beginning to get that feeling. But let me ask you something. Why Christmas day? What's so important about that? Christmas was always very special to my mom. But after I lost her I... I guess I didn't really feel like I had anything to celebrate. But all that changed after I found my family and met Ian. Now it feels like everything good in my life has come out of Christmas. So what better way to start our lives together than to do so on the day that makes us both so happy? I agree. So I talked to Pastor Wayland, we're all set, the only thing is he wants to talk to both of us before the wedding. Oh, absolutely. Just let me know when. How are you doing on your vows? Yeah, uh, yeah, great. Really. I have never known you to be at a loss for words before. What? No. No. We said that we were gonna write our own vows and that's what I'm gonna do. I'm just trying to find a way to say uh... stuff. Stuff. Yeah. Anyway, let's go see how my dad's making out on the set. Oh, there you are. Hi. Looks like Ian's really put everyone to work in there. Well, if they'd stop laughing long enough to get any actual work done... [laughs] I didn't realize until I got back here just how much I was looking forward to singing a Christmas carol again. And before you know it you will have that thing memorized just like the rest of us. [laughs] By the way, I heard from another of James' friends this morning. Really? Yeah, Thomas Reed, an old fellow actor. He said he'd love to come to the wedding. Oh, um... you invited him, too. I did it again, didn't I? Um, it's just that I am so excited about this wedding and about you and... and the fact that you and I can do this together. Well, I think it's so wonderful that they can come, I just- I'm not sure there'll be enough room at the cottage, so- You're exactly right. I mean, that- that place is too small. But I think that I have a solution. You do? Why not have the wedding at Peter and Ellie's house? And we can put up a tent on the back lawn and that way you'll have plenty of room. Oh, your father and I just had the most wonderful parties there. That's... I... Just think about it, ok? I will. [sighs] Ian, Margaret invited so many people. Well, we'll talk to her about that. You didn't see her face. I've never seen her like that. When she talks about our wedding she's just so... vibrant. It's like for the first time she wants everyone to know. To know? What do you mean? Look. Everyone she invited, they knew my father. Mmmhmm. Cared about him. Mmmhmm. I think, for Margaret, our wedding is a chance to show people that I'm a part of him and he's a part of me and she cares about me the way he would have. That's actually pretty sweet. I know. What would you like to do? I don't know. Come here. I just can't help but wonder... what if something happens? Happens, like what? I don't know, just something to spoil this for us. Nothing is gonna spoil this for us. I promise. How can you be so sure? Because I'm pretty sure that every couple wants their wedding day to be perfect just like we do. And they worry about what can go wrong. But there are two things that I feel very confident about. What? The first is something always goes wrong. Great. And the second is that something always goes wrong. Ian! [laughs] But nothing is gonna stop us from having the wedding day that we've always wanted. Nothing. Thank you. Goodnight. And the flowers you ordered for your bouquet are on the way. They're gonna be beautiful. Thank you so much, Lydia. Mmmhmm. Now, Margaret mentioned something about a change of venue for the wedding? She did? It's not a problem, just be sure to let me know where you want everything delivered. See you later. Bye. Thank you. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you, too. Hi. Miranda, hi. Hi, Peter. No hug for your future father-in-law? Well, bring it in. Nice to see you again. You too. I'm sorry I missed you this morning, I had to get out of the house early. We're finalizing plans for the Christmas tree lighting. Oh, no, it's fine. The kids have kept me busy. I'm sure they have. So what brings you by the theatre? Well, Ian had some errands to run so I thought I'd do some shopping and then I saw you outside of the theatre talking to someone. Ah, our mystery man. No, he seems like a nice enough guy, it's just not every day that someone just drops in out of nowhere and wants to make a donation. A donation? To the theatre. Mr. Finley says he'd be more than happy to help. So who is this generous stranger? Not quite sure. He found his way here all the way from sunny California. California. Really. He said he remembers dad from his acting days and when he read about the Whitcomb Theatre he decided to get in touch. Did he happen to say where he read about the theatre? I don't think so. I'm sure we'll hear more about it when we see him the next time. Oh, he's- he's coming back to town? Actually, he said something about staying at the inn. He wanted to take in some of our town's Christmas spirit. Um, I have a few more errands to run so I'm gonna go. - See you at the house. - Ok. Bye. Bye. Miranda. Oh, it's so good to see you. You too. How are you? Good. Yeah? Are you crazed with all these last minute wedding plans? Not just yet. Good, let's keep it that way. Mmmhmm. Meanwhile, our Christmas rush is officially underway. Mmmhmm. Plus a wonderful wedding. So you know where everything is, uh, help yourself to some tea. There's fresh scones in the tea room. I'll be in as soon as I can, we'll catch up. Ok. Thanks, Catherine. [phone ringing] Carlton Heath Inn, Merry Christmas. Mr. Finley. Hello, uh, Ms. Chester. You show up in my office in Boston and the next day you turn up here. That's no coincidence, is it? Miranda- I know why you're here. This is about James Whitcomb. About how no one knew he was my father- No. No. Miranda, this is not about your father. I'm here because of your mother. What about her? Um, is there somewhere else we can talk? I saw your mother play, Miranda, in the Tempest. Eve was mesmerizing. But so was your father. A remarkable man from everything I've heard about him. So you were there. You saw them. Yeah. Eve invited me. And how did you know her? Eve was my sister. I'm your uncle. That- that's impossible. I'm sorry, but my mother was an only child. She told me that when her parents died she had no other family. Miranda- And when she died I had no other family. Until I came here. Please, let me explain. There's nothing to explain. You're not the first person to show up here at Christmas asking questions, digging into my family's privacy, risking their happiness and my father's good name. You're too late. Whatever it is you're trying to gain it's not gonna happen so please just... leave me alone. Let us enjoy our Christmas and let me have the wedding that I've always wanted. Look, I never came here to tell you any of this. Then why are you here? Because after I met you in Boston, you told me you were getting married, I wanted to do something nice for you. I knew you'd never accept a wedding gift from a complete stranger, so... So you offered to make a donation to the theatre. Yeah. You told them you were from California. That's true. A small town in the northern part of the state. But when you came to my office you made it seem like you were from Boston. Yeah. Look, I just um... I wanted an excuse to meet you, to talk with you. So you expect me to believe that my mother had a brother with a different last name who she never told me about? Chester was your mother's middle name. She used it for a stage name. Miranda, I never meant to upset you. After I leave tomorrow you'll never see me again, I promise. I'm so sorry. It was actually Ian's idea the first time that we delivered gift baskets at Christmas. Remember, Ian? Mmmhmm. My first year back helping out with the inn. It was only a couple days before Christmas. And we were in a rush and we put all of the cookies in the baskets with everything else. Yeah, and dad and I were gonna deliver them first thing in the morning so I thought it would be a good idea if I put them in the back of the truck the night before. That was a bad idea. What happened? Sorry, what happened? It- it turns out raccoons have a serious sweet tooth. [laughing] Uh-huh. So, needless to say, we were up very early the next morning baking cookies. Mmm. Oh, there we go. Alright. [sighs] [doorbell rings] I've got it. Hi. My name's Thomas Reed, I'm here to see Margaret. Tommy. Merry Christmas, Margaret. Merry Christmas. I- wha- what are you doing here? I know I should have called first but uh, I wanted to surprise you. To say the least. [laughs] Thomas Reed, this is my son, Peter. Peter, this is Thomas Reed, he was a close friend of your father's. They were in the theatre together. We met back in the day when your mom used to bring you backstage after your dad's shows. I was a lot younger then. Weren't we all? [laughs] Well, I have a few things to do, I'll let you two catch up. Nice to see you again. And you. Bye, dear. Bye. Margaret, you look amazing. Oh, stop. Ah, but then you always did. And you were always a good actor. [laughs] So tell me, what- what on earth are you doing here so early? The- the wedding isn't until Christmas. Well, after I got your email about it I- I started thinking about James and you and how much I enjoyed our time together back then and I realized how long it's been since I've seen you. Oh, it's good to see you, Tommy. When you came into my life something changed. Things changed. Whatcha doing there? Nothing. Ok. Here, let me take that. Hmm. Miranda. I just... I just have one question for you before you leave. Sure. How did you know that I was Eve's daughter? It's true I had no idea Eve had a daughter. Not until I saw the article on the internet last Christmas about James Whitcomb. The internet. Of course. So it was the story that brought you here. Listen, Miranda, I don't blame you for being skeptical. You know, your mother loved Christmas. Merry Christmas, Miranda. I really missed you, Tommy. Oh, it's just so nice to have someone to share all these old memories with. Yeah, I've- I've missed you, too, Margaret. But I can't remember the last time anyone called me Tommy. Oh. Well, that's, you know, an old habit. Sorry. No, I- I like it. Suddenly I feel kinda... energized. Can I get you some more coffee? Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you. Sure. Do you believe him? No, I... I don't know. Miranda, he admitted that he found out about you online. He saw the story about how you came to Carlton Heath, he found out who your father was- I know, but he also didn't ask for anything. And he left after I asked him to leave. I just... I got a feeling. Look, what if it's true? What if my mother didn't tell me about him the same way she didn't tell me about my father? What if he really is my uncle? I understand why you'd want it to be true. What? For the first time you'd get to hear about a part of your mother's life that you never knew. A part of you that you never knew. What better gift than to open a window into that part of your world? Maybe it is too good to be true. You know, there is one thing we haven't talked about yet. What? Well, I believe it's traditional for the bride and groom to have the first dance at their wedding. Oh. Yes, yes. I believe I have heard something about this. And it occurred to me that you and I don't do much dancing. That's true. So... So what're we doing? Wait for it. Ok. I thought we could... Practice. â™ª Sleigh bells ring are you listening â™ª â™ª In the lane snow is glistening â™ª â™ª A beautiful site â™ª â™ª We're happy tonight â™ª â™ª Walking in the winter wonderland â™ª â™ª Gone away is the bluebird â™ª â™ª Here to stay is a new bird â™ª â™ª He sings a love song as we go along â™ª â™ª Walking in a winter wonderland â™ª â™ª Deck the halls with boughs of holly â™ª â™ª Fa la la la, la, la, la, la â™ª So Margaret mentioned that you may want to have the wedding ceremony at our house? Oh, um... we talked about it. Is that what you want to do? Um... Ok. Having been Margaret's daughter-in-law for some time now, if you want my advice? Mmmhmm. Just be direct Direct. Yes, You may have noticed that she's not really one to beat around the bush. [phone rings] Oh, sorry. Hi, this is Miranda. Yes, hi. Oh. Fantastic. We will be there tomorrow. Thanks. My dress is ready. [squealing] I can't wait to see it! Alright, one week and counting until Christmas and the wedding that we've all been waiting for. Lydia will deliver the flowers in the afternoon, we have our photographer and someone to video the ceremony. You really think two cameras is enough? Two are plenty. Ian and Andrew are getting their tux fittings on Thursday, musicians are on stand-by. Oh, when are you two meeting with Pastor Whalen? The day after tomorrow. Although I'm not totally sure what we're supposed to talk to him about. Don't worry, he has a sixth sense about these things, it'll be fine. Is everything ok in there? Um... Honey? Do you need some help? Uh, no, no. I'm good. Thanks. Are you ready? All set. Here goes. Oh. Oh, Miranda. What do you think? You- you look absolutely breathtaking. Beautiful. Beautiful. Oh, honey, I am so happy for you. Thank you. And Thomas said that most of the questions he gets from his students are still about his work with James. Really? Wow. Yeah, we've been talking on the phone and sharing old stories. I had forgotten how funny he is. Hmm. Well, he sounds really nice. Mmm. Sounds like you two are really hitting it off. What? No. No. Tommy's just a friend. [together] Tommy. Well, I would really like to meet him. Oh, you will. No, he's coming to the wedding, remember? Oh, of course. Oh, and speaking of that, have you given any more thought to my idea of having the ceremony at the house? Ian and I talked about it. At the house? Oh, Catherine, don't you remember all those wonderful parties that James and I had there? Yeah, no, I do. And I talked to the tent company and even on such short notice they said that it's not a problem, they can do it. Oh. So we just have to get back to them as soon as possible. I mean, we still have so much to do. Yeah. Miranda, when I first met you... no, saw you... when you first walked into my life... In all the time I've known you my feelings have never changed. [honking] You're back. I'm back. How'd it go with your dress? You'll just have to wait and see. I'm looking forward to it. Have you told Margaret yet? I kinda chickened out. I just didn't know how to tell her. Well, we'll work on it on the way. Where are we going? The McKendrick family tradition lives on. You're delivering baskets. Ho, ho, ho. [laughs] I am so excited. â™ª I know in my arms you'll be tonight. â™ª Lydia? â™ª Don't you worry â™ª â™ª about a thing my love â™ª Merry Christmas! â™ª The winter's calm â™ª â™ª The bells are ringing â™ª We brought baskets! â™ª And my heart is singing â™ª â™ª It's Christmas time It's Christmas time â™ª â™ª It's Christmas time â™ª I love this. â™ª When youâ€™re here with me â™ª â™ª There is nowhere else I'd rather be â™ª â™ª at Christmas time Christmas time â™ª Merry Christmas, Santa. â™ª Christmas time. â™ª Hey there, how'd it go? It's gonna be another great Christmas, dad. Ah. Hey, sweetie. Oh, a package came for you. A package? Yeah. I put it in the office. Thank you. I didn't order a package. Maybe it's an early Christmas present. Or maybe it's an early wedding present. What is it? What'd you get? What's wrong? Who is she? My mother. Who sent these? Charles Finley. Mmmhmm. Look at this one. Look at that costume. It must have been junior high. Her first play. She told me she only had one line, but that was enough. She had been bitten by the acting bug. I'm sorry you've never seen any of these before. We travelled around so much growing up, she didn't really hang on to photos or keepsakes from when she was a girl. Just what she could fit in her suitcase. She told me so many stories but these... these make it real. I can't believe I let him go. We still don't know that Finley is who he claims to be. How else would he have these photos? I need to find out if he's really my uncle and I need to know what happened between them and why she never told me about it. What do you think? I think it looks beautiful. I thought I'd get a jump on this for Santa's grand entrance at the tree lighting tonight. Oh. I assume Prancer will be pulling Santa's sleigh again this year? With bells on. Oh, I see what you did there. You know, Mrs. Claus was such a big hit last year I was thinking she might like to come along tonight for the ride. Hmm, were you? I mean, since she will be the real Mrs. Claus very soon. She wouldn't miss it for the world. Santa will be very happy to hear that. So I tried to find Charles Finley on the internet last night. I couldn't find anyone by that name or description in California. Oh, no? No. Charlie, Chuck, even Chaz, I tried them all. I just wish I knew a little more about who he is or where exactly he lives. What his job is. Anything. Well, we'll just have to keep looking. In the meantime I believe we have one or two things to help keep us in the holiday spirit. Would you mind hanging those on the back for me? When is Santa coming? Oh, I'm sure he will be here any minute. Margaret! Tommy? Merry Christmas. I didn't know you were coming tonight. Well, I heard about the Christmas tree lighting and I thought I'd check it out. Oh. Look at you full of surprises. [laughs] You remember my son, Peter. Yes, hi. Welcome back. His wife, Ellie. My grandchildren, Mark and Julia. Hi. Hi. We're having some people over to the house after the tree lighting, hope you can join us. I don't want to intrude. Don't be silly, Tommy. Of course you're coming. Well, how could I say no to that? Why don't we go and get that hot chocolate and warm up? Sounds good. Nice to meet you. Nice to see you. Bye. We'll see you two later. Shall we? Don't mind if I do. Oh my, look at that. What a beautiful tree. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! [applause] Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho. What a turn out. Merry Christmas. So good to see everyone again. Everybody ready? (All): Yes! Ten. (All): Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. [cheering] Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Santa. Merry Christmas, Julia. Merry Christmas. Hi sweetie. You see, Miranda? We hung your stocking just like last year. I see that. Thank you so much. And after you're married we'll put one up for Ian, too. Well, if he's a good boy. Miranda, I have someone who very much would like to meet you. This is Thomas Reed. Thomas, Miranda. Hi. What a pleasure to finally meet you. Your father was a very dear friend of mine. Well, it's very nice to meet you. Maybe later I could uh, share some wonderful stories about him. I'd like that so much. (Margaret): Come with me. I want you to meet Ian's parents. (Thomas): Nice to meet you. (Miranda): You too. Miranda, can I show you something? Sure. You remember our mystery man? What about him? Turns out he wasn't just talk. I got an email from him wanting to make a donation to the theatre. Wha- that's- wow. So his name really is Finley. Well, according to this, it's Joseph Charles Finley of Fuller Springs, California. So Charles is his middle name. But he insists that his donation be anonymous. He doesn't want us to use his name. Just shows you how wrong you can be about someone. Yes, it does. (Ellie): Miranda, Ian's here. Now, what about the service itself? What do you have in mind? Well, we'd like to keep it simple. Really just an opportunity to include our friends and family in our celebration. Um, we've written our own vows. How's that going? Good. All done. Really? Aren't you? Yeah. I mean, practically. I have some tweaking to do, but yeah. Good. I understand from Margaret there may be a change in venue? The Whitcomb home instead of your cottage? Well, we haven't exactly decided yet. Christmas is in four days. And it's at the top of our list. What about family? Is everyone on board with the marriage? Any issues you'd like to talk over? My parents absolutely love Miranda. They can't wait for us to be married. That's what I like to hear. Miranda? Um, Ian and I haven't really talked about it yet but I've been thinking and there is someone else I'd like to invite to the wedding. A family member? Um, maybe. I'm- I'm actually not sure yet. I'm sorry, I don't understand. (whispering): You didn't tell me that you wanted to invite him to our wedding. I just thought about it on the way over here. You don't know anything about him. I know, but I would talk to him first to make sure before I invited him to the wedding. Ian, is there something you'd like to say to Miranda? Miranda grew up not knowing who her family was. Now that she does it means everything to her. All I want is for her to be happy on our wedding day. I like him. Me too. Good guy. Yeah. Thank you for what you said about inviting Charles to the wedding. Sure. Joseph. What? His real name is Joseph Finley, which he forgot to mention when he met you, apparently. You think inviting him is a mistake. I meant what I said. I want you to be happy. I know, but there was more you wanted to say when Pastor Whalen asked. What if you're wrong? What if he's just some guy who's in this for himself? Who thinks he can get something out of it? I don't believe that's true. What if it is? What then? I told you, I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you and I'm worried about what this might do to you, and to this day that means so much to us. Ian... Look, when I came to Carlton Heath two years ago I was looking for my family and no one believed me... except you. And if you hadn't I never would have had the chance to prove that my story was true and we wouldn't be about to start our lives together. If there is even the slightest chance that his story is true, that he's just trying to find his family the same way I was trying to find mine, shouldn't I give him that chance? I hope you're right. Me too. [knocking] Come in. I'm not supposed to wake you up. It's alright, sweetie. I'm already awake. Can I ask you something? Of course. Everybody else is busy with work and shopping and stuff and Mark is going sledding with his friends. Uh-huh. But I really wanna bake Christmas cookies and mom says I'm not old enough to do it by myself, even though I totally could. Lots of times, even when she's there, I do everything anyway and she doesn't even have to help me. Julia, I would love to make Christmas cookies with you. Really? Mmmhmm. Just let me get dressed. I'll meet you out there. Thank you, Auntie Miranda. [laughs] You know, I was thinking about it, that the last time you wore a tux you must have been in high school, right? Senior prom under protest. What're you talking about? Everybody wears a tux to prom. It doesn't mean you have to like it. It's a special occasion. One of life's moments. Like getting married. Well, the getting married part is great but does the bow tie have to cut off my air supply? You look like a million bucks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, hey, we've come up with a new floor plan. If we rearrange the dining room there'll be plenty of room for everybody. You don't have to do that. Are you kidding? We're having a blast. You just let us know if there's anything else you need. How are you with wedding vows? Stuck, are you? I know what I wanna say. I know the words to say it, I just can't seem to get them in the right order. And there's just been so many distractions over the last couple of days... That's normal. You're both busy, got so much to do. This is different. You wanna talk about it? I think Miranda and I need to work it out. She's just been through so much over the last two years. I really wanted this to be... simple for her. Well, whatever's going on son, simple or not, I'm sure that you and Miranda will work it out. 'Cause that's what a vow is, right? It's a promise from the heart to somebody you love that no matter what you'll always be there. And from what I can see, you and Miranda took that vow a long time ago. I am so proud of you, son. Thanks, dad. I still can't breathe. [laughs] Miranda? Mmmhmm? Were you ever flower girl at a wedding? Mmmhmm. When I was about your age. Were you ever kind of nervous about, you know, doing it wrong? Maybe a little, but you know what? What? I remembered that out of all the little girls in the world the bride had chosen me to throw the petals for her to walk down the aisle, just like I chose you. And I am sure you are going to do a wonderful job. I can't wait. Neither can I. Well, what do you think? I think they're ready. I do, too. That's the angel bracelet that Ian gave to you the first Christmas you were here. Yes. Yes, it is. It's very pretty. Sometimes, when I look at it and I think very hard about Ian and just how much he means to me- [phone buzzes] [laughs] Your timing is incredible. What'd I do? Oh, just made Julia and me believe in Christmas magic. With one phone call? Not bad. [giggles] Where are you? I just finished getting my tux. Oh! How'd it go? I guess you'll just have to wait and see. Sounds like we both have something to look forward to. Listen, about yesterday, I think sometimes I worry too much. No, I think you worry just the right amount. So you're ok? Hey, we're getting married in three days. I'm a lot more than ok. I'm gonna head over to the theatre, help dad out with rehearsal. Why don't you come by later? I'll see you there. I love you. I love you, too. Oh, you little sneak! You are in trouble, missy! [laughs] Margaret. Oh, hello, Ian. How's it going in there? Good. Good. No, your father seems more than ready to be back on stage. No kidding. Well, I better get in there, make sure he doesn't chew up the scenery. Oh, Ian, uh, did Miranda mention that she met Thomas Reed at the party last night? Yeah, she told me about that. He so enjoyed talking to her. Gosh, I have known Tommy for, what, 40 years now? He was always such a good friend to James and me but now that it's just the two of us it feels... it feels strange. Well, Miranda said he seems like a really nice guy. You knew, didn't you? When you met Miranda two Christmases ago, you knew how you felt about her. Yeah, I guess I figured out pretty quick that I wanted to be with her. Yeah, I could tell. I remember thinking how extraordinary it was that, despite everything, all the obstacles that stood between you and Miranda, you... you always stayed true to your feelings and you found a way. Here you are, about to be married. Here we are. I'm a lucky guy. No, no. Luck had nothing to do with it. You fell in love and you were fearless with your love. That's uh... thank you. It's just been so long. Margaret, I'm no expert, but you said you and Thomas are friends. That seems like a pretty good place for two people to start out. Yeah, it does, doesn't it? Thank you. [phone rings] Merry Christmas, thanks for calling Grace Fellowship Church, this is Nicole, how may I help you? Hi, um... I hope I have the right number. I was um, I'm just trying to reach Charl- I'm trying to reach Joseph Finley. Oh, I'm sorry, Pastor Finley is off until the holidays. Pastor Finley? Yes, that's right. I'm just curious, how long has he been a pastor there? Oh, gosh, 20 years? Yeah, he's become quite the fixture around here. We're all very fond of Pastor Charlie. I thought Charles was his middle name. Uh, everyone's been calling him Pastor Charlie for, like, forever. Is there um- do you- do you have a cell number where I could reach him? Oh, I'm sorry. But he does check in sometimes for messages. Could you please tell him that Miranda called? Miranda, sure. Merry Christmas, Miranda. Thank you. He's a pastor? Mmmhmm. Has been for years at the same church in Northern California. I don't understand. Why wouldn't he just tell you that? I don't know. But he came here at Christmas, Ian, and... and it was to find me. Someone he believed was his family, and I... I didn't listen. Well, that's- that's not... no one would expect you to just open your arms and welcome him into the family. The way everyone opened their arms to me? Tell me what you wanna do. I want to marry you at Christmas. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. And I need to find him. I just... I need to know. Ok. I think we should do all of the above, but first let's get out of the cold. Ok. Ok. Hello? Oh, hi Miranda. You two look busy. Uh, we sent Peter on an errand with the kids so we could finally get some Christmas wrapping done. Oh. Why don't you sit down and join us? Thank you, but I'm actually feeling a little tired. I think I'm just gonna head to my room. Wait, you're not getting sick right before your wedding, are you? It was just a busy day. Ok. But let us know if you need anything. I will. Goodnight. Goodnight. Oh, uh, Miranda, I- I spoke with that tent company again. They tell me they hadn't heard from you. No. Well, we don't have a lot of time left so you really should speak to them. Margaret... You know what? I'm gonna run and just go get some tape from the office. Margaret, I so appreciate everything you've done to help plan this wedding. Ian and I both do. But... we want to be married at the cottage. Oh, but there are so many people. I know, but... the cottage has just been a part of this family for so long and that makes it mean even more to me. There's really nowhere we'd rather start our lives together. And being there, it just... it makes me feel closer to my father even though he won't be there to walk me down the aisle. Of course, I... I just didn't know that you felt that way. Thank you for understanding. Goodnight. Goodnight. [knocking] Come in. Miranda. Hi. Um, forgive the intrusion. Um, I just wanted to apologize. What you said about the cottage, I should have realized. I'm afraid I've just been a little distracted lately. It's alright, really. But now that I know we will make this right, I promise you. Thank you. Oh, what a cute girl. Who is that? That's my mother. In high school. Every Christmas she worked at the mall. Miranda? I just haven't seen any of these photos until a few days ago. Where did they come from? My uncle. I- I'm sorry, I don't understand. I thought you told me that your mother had no siblings. That's what I thought. I first met him in Boston and then he- he came here to tell me who he was and... and he sent me those photos. So you knew nothing about this man and your mother never mentioned she had a brother? No. I just wish that you had felt that you could have come to me about this. I wanted to, I just didn't... You didn't what? You've seemed so happy with Thomas and I didn't want you to have to worry about any of this. Still haven't heard from Finley? Did I do the right thing telling Margaret about him? Of course. I could just see how concerned she was that this was gonna affect the family and that's- that's the last thing I want. I know that, love. And after Margaret has had some time to think about it she'll understand that, too. I hope you're right. Have you ever asked yourself why your mother kept these secrets from you? I think she was just trying to protect me from getting hurt. I think so, too. Kinda like you. The first time you came here you were ready to leave without telling anyone who you were. You were gonna keep it a secret. But I stayed because of you. No. You stayed because of you. You're so much stronger than you give yourself credit for. You don't need to keep secrets to protect yourself, or anyone else, for that matter. Ah, Peter told me you'd be here. Am I interrupting? Thomas, I didn't think I'd see you until tomorrow. Well, I had this sudden urge to be roasting chestnuts over an open fire, like in the song. Well, what a nice surprise. I also heard there's a performance tonight of a certain Dickens classic. I thought we might get a bite to eat and see it together. Uh, my grandchildren are in the show and I always go with Peter and Ellie. But of course you're welcome to join us. Sounds like I should have called first. I'm sorry. No, you have no reason to apologize. I've enjoyed our time together as much as you have. No, it's I who should apologize. What're you talking about? Well, I just realized that, uh, I've allowed myself to become distracted and there's just so much going on so I feel that I should just take a step back and focus on my family. I think your family's doing just fine, Margaret. Maybe it's time to focus on yourself a little bit. Who knows what might happen? [bells tolling] Wow, that looks great. There you go. Mr. Finley? Oh, Miranda. Hi. I was just on my way to come and find you but... I've never been able to resist church bells, especially at Christmas. You got my message. Yeah. And you got those pictures of Eve? Why didn't you tell me that you were the pastor of your church? I thought about how it would sound, me coming here asking for your trust and then saying I was a man of the cloth. Might have just been a little too convenient, don't you think? Probably. Anyway, I figured no matter what I said you're gonna have to make up your own mind whether to believe me or not. Ah, so beautiful. [bells tolling] When I saw mom's photos they reminded me so much of all the stories she told me about her childhood. [laughs] She was a real firecracker, your mom. Nothing slowed her down. But she never told me about you. Well, it's not what she wanted. What happened? When I went to see her in the Tempest I was uh... a young pastor in my very first church and I was so certain about right and wrong. Everything was black and white. There was no room for grey or doubt or... Anyway, she introduced me after the show to James Whitcomb and they were so much in love. Everyone could see it. But then I found out that he was still in the middle of his divorce and that was just simply not acceptable to me. I told her so in so many words. I said some things that night that... What did she say? Well, she was stunned. She was hurt. She hugged me, hard, told me she loved me. I never spoke to her again. She never told you about me? I never gave her the chance. What do you mean? When she phoned a few months later and I was still so sure of how things should be in the world. I was so arrogant. I never picked up the phone. And then, ultimately of course, the phone stopped ringing. I realize now that she was- she was trying to tell me about you. She was reaching out to me, her brother, for help and I just wasn't there for her. You didn't know. Yeah. I've told myself that a thousand times. It doesn't matter. She was family. I should have been there for her no matter what. Did you even know how to reach her? I mean, she moved around so much at that time I uh, I lost track of Eve. And then I found out she had a beautiful daughter named Miranda, and all I want now is to tell you how sorry I am that I was never there for you, either. I am very glad you're here now. Well, I- I should get going. It's almost Christmas, you must have a million things to do before the wedding. There's someone I'd really like you to meet. Are you sure? Very much. (Announcement): The show will begin in two minutes, please take your seats. That's two minutes. I was just calling you. The show's about to begin. Sorry we're late. Ian, I'd like you to meet Charles Finley, my uncle. It's a great pleasure to meet you, Ian. And congratulations on the upcoming wedding. Nice to meet you, too. It's a pleasure. Think we can find an extra seat in there? Yeah, of course. Thank you. There isn't doubt but ever about that. And scrooge's name was good upon change for anything... [crowd laughing] [laughter] God bless us, everyone. [applause] Have you seen this weather report for Christmas Eve? Hmm? It looks like there's a front moving in. Good. Looks like we'll have a white Christmas. Hmm. Oh, and a white wedding. [chuckles] White wedding. That's good. Listen, we're taking the kids for hot chocolate. Why don't you join us? Uh... I don't think so. I have a lot to do here. But you go ahead. I was surprised I didn't see Thomas Reed at the show last night. You two seemed to really hit it off. Peter, I have known Thomas most of my life and we did not hit it off, he's... he's just a good friend. And a really nice guy who I think would like to spend Christmas with you. And who makes you smile in a way I haven't seen in a long time. Just saying. So tomorrow morning we are opening presents very early with the kids and then we're having a quick breakfast before Ian and I have to start getting ready, so you should just plan on coming over to the house. You're so kind to invite me for Christmas and the wedding, but um... this is your family here. This- this is your home. This is where you and Ian are gonna start to build a life together. This is a time when you should be with people you're close to. People you love. And I would- I would never want to intrude on that. But I have so many more stories to tell you about your mother, so believe me, we'll be together again very, very soon. Merry Christmas, Miranda. Merry Christmas, Uncle Charlie. I don't want you to... No, that's no good. Anyway. Tommy? What're you doing out here? I want to talk to you, Margaret. Ok, fine. Let's go in the house so you don't freeze to death. No, I- I need to think about this and I want to say this now to make sure that I say it right. What're you talking about? You're not the easiest person in the world to talk to, you know? You can be very stubborn at times. Oh, for goodness sake. Over the nearly 40 years that we've known each other I have come to cherish your friendship. Well, of course. But at the same time, in the- in the past couple of weeks I have discovered that I may have... other feelings towards you. Feelings that I never had when James was with us, which is why it's so completely unexpected. And confusing. Hmm, confusing? Because I never want to jeopardize our friendship. So if that's what you want... Tommy. To remain just friends- No, no, Tommy. Tommy. Listen to me. Would you like to spend Christmas Eve with us tonight? Very much. Good. Now can we go inside? Good idea. It's very cold out here. How long have you been standing out here? You really don't have... It's still snowing. I know. According to this the roads between here and the highway have been closed pretty much all day. Nobody's going anywhere. Well, at least it's a very cozy Christmas Eve in here. Though we might have to dig a path for our wedding guests tomorrow. All the more reason to cozy up by the fire tonight. Did... did Charles Finley check out? Yes. Yeah, about two hours ago. But I'd be surprised if he's gotten very far in this weather. Come on. Oh. â™ª Silent Night, â™ª â™ª holy night, â™ª â™ª All is calm, â™ª â™ª all is bright, â™ª â™ª Round yon virgin, â™ª â™ª Mother and child, â™ª â™ª Holy infant so tender and mild, â™ª It turns out I'm not going anywhere tonight after all. I'm so glad. We're all happy you're here, Charlie. â™ª Sleep in heavenly peace â™ª Merry Christmas! (Mark): Thank you, I love it! Be careful when you open it. [gasps] I love you. Ian, Ian. What if I trip when I'm walking down the aisle? Or what if I drop the ring? I've been a little worried about that stuff myself. You have? So it sounds like we're kinda in the same boat, huh? What do you think we should do? I guess we just have to, you know... focus. And try not to think about all the other stuff. Makes sense. I mean, even if we're a little nervous it's probably ok, right? Yeah, I mean, we just have to remember why we're there. That you and Miranda are getting married and that's pretty cool. That's very cool. We're all friends and family, anyways. And that's what matters. That we're all together on this... special day. To help make this happen. So what's there to be nervous about? That's right. Thanks, Mark. This really helped me. No problem. Hey, you know what? I'm getting married today. I better get dressed. Me too. Cool. [violins playing] â™ª Oh, she said she wanted a few minutes for herself. But it's almost time. Maybe we should remind her. I think we can give her another minute. Ok. Alright. How're you feeling? Ian? Ian? Dad? Yeah? You'll be fine. Just remember who's coming through that door. [knocking] Come in. Miranda. Hi. You almost ready? Good. Margaret? Would you... there's something I'd like to ask you and it means a lot to me. Hi. Hi. Charles Finley. Thomas Reed. Pleasure to meet you. There's a seat right here if you want. Thank you. Ok. How uh, how do you know... I'm Miranda's uncle. Oh, really? Fantastic. Wonderful. Take your time. There's no hurry. It's a special day for Miranda and Ian, and one you'll remember for the rest of your lives. So smile and enjoy yourselves. Smile! Please rise. [wedding march plays] â™ª There you go. You look so beautiful. Ian. Please be seated. We're gathered here to join this lovely couple in holy matrimony. And now we come to the time for the couple to read the vows they've written for each other. Miranda, it's no secret that it was a very special photograph that brought you to Carlton Heath two years ago and I've been grateful that you found that photograph every day since. It's almost as if Father Christmas, your father, had a hand in guiding you here to me. When you came into my life everything changed. You brought so much joy and light and beauty that I had never experienced before. But best of all you've shown me what love really is. And that our love is stronger than any obstacle, any distance, any challenge. That together there is absolutely nothing we can't do. You make me fearless with love. I had a little bit of trouble writing my vows, I hope that was ok. [crowd laughs] With this ring I promise that I will always love you. I promise that no matter what we face I will always be beside you and I promise that I will cherish you for all the days of my life. I love you so much. Ian, when I first saw you I was trying and failing to get directions on my phone. [laughs] Fortunately for me, you were there to point me in the right direction. I thought about that a lot since then because you've been there beside me to help me find my way ever since. For most of my life I've wondered where I belonged. When I came to Carlton Heath I met you. I found my answer. Oh. With this ring I promise to always be there for you, to encourage you, to honor you, to cherish you. I love you with all of my heart and I always will. And now, by the power vested in me, Miranda and Ian, I couldn't be happier. I now pronounce you husband and wife. [laughter] You may kiss your bride. [laughter] [applause] And Merry Christmas! [laughter] [cheering] Bye! You ready? Hey! Oh, yeah, that's our sign. I'm ready. Step up. [horse whinnies]
