(soft piano music) (rhythmic piano music) (car engine rev) (soft piano music) - No pain any better. (swelling music) - She goes to bed at eight o'clock no wonder there wasn't anyone to answer the phone. We rush 500 miles and they are in bed? - Don't make any noise. I don't want mama waking up, okay? I just want to see if Rosetta is all right before we go back to the car. (soft piano music) (suspenseful music) (door slams) (suspenseful music) Rose? (door squeaking) (chocking) (breathing heavily) (mumbles) - [Woman] What's going on, in there? What's going on? Franny, what's going on? - She drunk ammonia ma'am. - Rosseta what did you drink? You can't take her out like that. - We're taking her to the goddamn hospital. (door bangs) (breathing heavily) - (mumbles) too young to (mumbles). - Is she going to live? - I don't think she wants to live. - No, you are the last person that she needs to see right now. - I understand my child, but the doctor has asked me to looking on her. - All right then, no last rights. (soft piano music) What happened? - Quite this is hard. - You've got to tell me what happened Rose. - No pain, no pain. Heaven. - Rose! You don't decide, when to go to heaven, God decides that. You're not going to go anywhere Rose, cause God does... God does not want you anymore. And I'm warning you, if you give up now, you're gonna go straight to hell. (swelling music) (singing in foreign language) - She should be embracing the notes, not fighting them. - Mama, talk to me. Rose might not make it, she might die. What happened here? - She didn't know what she was drinking. - She knew mama she wanted to die. - Oh, stop being melodramatic. - Really? - I spoke to the doctors myself. They said they're doing everything possible. - And so did I, and they can't do anything to help her because she doesn't want to live mama. - Don't be ridiculous. She wouldn't even understand what that means. She was doing fine. We were both doing fine. With your stupid letters that you send her. - Don't you dare put that shit on me. - Don't talk to me on that-- - She was not going to (mumbles) in the phon. I saw it in the letter that she wrote me. I know the signs mama. That's why I came back, goddamn you know what happened? (singing in foreign language) (soft piano music) - I'm telling you Regina, it's not normal. For our kids you never make some (foreign language) you never did this to the others. - [Regina] She's not like the others. No one will ever know her. - You gotta treat her normal. You are a (mumbles). (melodious piano music) How long are you gonna keep her locked up? - [Regina] It's kind of (mumbles). - Rosetta, bring it quick. (foreign language) - Rosetta, your mama (speaks foreign language) I love you. I love you. Look at me darling, look at me Rosetta. I love you. (soft piano music) (chair squeaking) (singing in foreign language) - All right like that I want you hold there, in crescendo. - But... - Don't tell me sing it for me, Michelle all right? (singing in foreign language) - I told you to hold the high. (foreign language) Now, I sung it for you, I told you. - But madam, that's not how it's written. - That's how any great soprano would sing it, Michelle. Your daughter knows more than I. I think you should find her an instructor worthy over her talent. - Madam I know nothing. (foreign language) - God gave you a gift Michelle. Don't turn your back on it. (swelling music) (chair squeaking) - Regina, stop worrying about the baby, the doctors don't know everything. This is not your fault. (breathing heavily) (Child humming) - [Man] Mummy breakfast, I don't want your kids late for choir practice. (foreign language) (humming) - Food. - Can you say food? - Food. - Francesca, maybe God doesn't want Rosetta to say food, food. - It's okay with him. Food, say food. - [Regina] Franco? - What do you expect Regina, if you don't make him go to church every day they don't know about it. - Going to church seven days a week does not bring you closer to God. - [Frank] Its better than not going at all, you should set an example for the little ones. - Rose want to go church mum, look at her. - You should mind your status here. - Tommy, Rosetta does know how to behave herself. - She does too maa'. - [Frank] Everybody is welcomed to God's house. (fast piano music) (humming) - Come on, Rosetta. (swelling music) (singing in foreign language) ♪ And the father arise ♪ ♪ And then the sheep appear ♪ (laughing) (clapping) - Bravo, bravo. - I think I have a great future in stage, right mama. - Oh, you might have a future on the radio it pays better. I want you all to play now so I can feel it. So it breaks my heart. I expect you to concentrate Violet. (violin music) - Mama, Franny is standing right in the way, I can't concentrate. - Franny, come on you got to play too. - Frank? She's spoiling it for the others. You're just overcompensating for her arm. - You play, mm-hmm? Absolutely. - Franco, why do you encourage them you raise their expectations for nothing. - Why can't you have some fun? Eeh, come on. (violin music) (piano music) - [Tommy] Where did my friend see this? (piano music) - But, who taught her that? - She does it all the time, it's mimicking that's all she doesn't understand anything. - [Frank] Then let her mimic. (child screaming) - I'll not have the entire neighborhood talking about this come on Rosetta. Come along children. (foreign language) Back to work. (piano music) - [Tommy] Red Rover, Red Rover, let Franny come over. - Ah, don't let her play, you should she'll never stop anyone from breaking through. - Aw, let her play. - Why should I? She's a freak, her and her sister are a bunch of freaks. - We're not freaks. - Hey, hey break it up what's the matter with you? (child yelling) (mumbles) stop. Come here. Get away. (child yelling) (breaths heavily) - She's doing it again. - All right. (pants) - All right, where's that bad, bad thing is gone (mumbles). (pants) Got you. You see what I got it. (pants) You got no more business with this little girl. (pants) All bad things gone, only good things left. We've to all sing Christopher again, huh? - What do you think is wrong? - Things from her world I suppose. Sometimes it's safe in there but then sometimes it's filled with monsters like heaven and hell all rolled into one. - Heaven and hell? - Mm-hmm, yeah. You hang on to this as long as you want, okay? Come on, let's go. - I wanted to play with violets friends today, but they wouldn't let me. All they did was laugh and make fun of my arm. - Now you gonna make that bother, huh? They wanna laugh, you let them laugh but don't go feeling sorry for yourself or they got you, okay? (soft piano music) - You forgot to turn off the radio. (indistinct chattering) (piano music) (singing in foreign language) - Rose look. Horse, try to say horse. Say horse Rose. - [Mrs. Simpson] I know I can get it this time, Mrs. Basilio - Please try it again. (singing in foreign language) Mrs. Simpson? - Yes. - The high note is flat. Again. - Know that (mumbles) my friends. - Let's take it from the top. (singing in foreign language) - Keep her away from me. - Well you are off pitch you know? - I'm going to get a glass of water. (suspenseful music) - Rosetta. Mama. (piano music) - Violet. (foreign language) - 18:38. - Can you say meat? - Can you say meat. Can you say meat, can you say meat. - Rosy. Can you say meat. - Just give her the food Francesca you expect too much. - Say plate. - Say plate. - Francesca. - Try this one Rose. Ouch what did you do that for? - You've got to keep Rosetta with you when I'm giving a lesson. - You should be grateful for that, she was even naughty than I never had before. - Mrs. Syms, thank you. Francesca has to learn to do that for herself. Don't look at me like that young lady. - Knife, say knife. - If Rosetta was going to carry on her conversation she would have done it by now. - No she wouldn't. - I beg your pardon? - You heard me. - You are encouraging her to do things she can't possibly do. - [Frank] Regina Basilio. - It's pointless and it's cruel Frank and you've got to put a stop to it. I don't understand it, it's so ridiculous-- (Frank yelling) (suspenseful music) (footsteps) (singing in foreign language) - Thank you, madam LaSelva we have your resume. - Oh madam Basilio, we've been dying to meet you. - Hello I'm delighted. It's a wonderful day isn't it ladies? - I thought I would show you the idea from Bohemian - Oh yes it is. (footsteps) - I want you to take your seats ladies. - Oh. - Oh no, madam Basilio we really didn't ask you here to sing. - We we're hoping to ask for your help. - With your vast knowledge of opera and staging. We just wanted some professional advice about producing an extravaganza like this, and some assistance filling out the chorus with your students perhaps. - We want our first annual fundraiser for King George Hospital to kick off with lots of style. - I hope we have not offended you. We'd love to show you some of these designs. Come. (suspense music) (dog barks) (Rosetta barking) - Rosetta? Rosetta. (dog barking) ( foreign language) - Oh you're being super canning, come on get out of here. (groaning) What is wrong with her? (groaning) - Stop, it's okay. (screaming) (mumbles) - It was my fault papa, I wasn't watching her. - I just insist that, you don't tell that thing to your mother, okay? (singing in foreign language) - And Jessica, you shouldn't spy on people. Come sit with me. Papa said you had a good time today. You wanna tell me about it? - Are you going to sing at the theater? (singing in foreign language) Franny. You know, the doctor said I was told to have and Rosetta I had you anyway, you're God's gift. - This seems babies are off on Cabbage Patch. How can you pick me? - Course you just like me and Francisca, you're strong. (soft music) A lot more coming up for your station. (singing in foreign language) - You remember my student Michelle, don't you? She was one of my best sopranos. She always adored you. - Oh, yes. Did I tell you I'm teaching her daughter now. (laughing) Imagine. Anyway, I spoke to Michelle. I told her you move back, and she wants to have just the two of us over for dinner next week. - Regina, what are you talking about? We're only here for a couple of days. - Well, I think it would be nice Nick. - I have to get back to work. - What do you want me to tell Michelle? - Ma'am tell her that I'd love to come. (footstep) - [Woman] We better hurry or we'll miss visiting hours. - What the hell's going on? We come here for Rose, now your mother is telling everyone you're moving back. And she treats me like I'm her Butler. - I'm open to any suggestions as to how to handle this situation. - You tell her you have a home and a husband. - Nick, I need your help it's been my mother who has been killing her off piece by piece now, that means that I have to play along with her, then I have to in order to get Rose out of this mess. - Franny look, I love your sister Rose. But sometimes I wonder when is this all gonna end. You see more in her than there is. You expect too much from everybody. If your mother doesn't give her up, you're gonna move back, aren't you? - Maybe I do expect a lot. - Oh yes Franny, too much. - Please just drive. - You wouldn't go through all this for me, would you? - I don't have time to sit here and feel sorry for you. - All right, I have a job last time I checked anyway. (door bangs) If you decide to come back, would you bring my stuff? (car engine roaring) (suspenseful music) - No, stop, stop where are you taking her? Where are you taking her? (car engine revs) What's going on. - [Man] We're taking her to the hospital. - What's going on? Oh my God. (door bangs) (chair squeaking) - So, how are you feeling today was, huh? - F sharp. - Excuse me. - F sharp. - With the assignment you've been assigned on F sharp? Tell me do you like music Rosetta? - I like music, absolutely. - Yeah, me too. What kind of music do you like? Rock and roll? Classical? Mozart? - Mozart one 1756 in Salzburg Hospital. Just first book on Marianne September 1762, died in 1791. He was 35. - You almost died, absolutely. - Almost died, absolutely. - Can you tell me what happened? As your dad, I want to help you, but you can help me too. You do wanna go home, don't you? (chair squeaking) (Rosetta yelling) Rosetta, Rosetta what happened the night that you drank (mumbles)? Rosetta sit quietly. Just sit, no come on. It's gonna hurt you. Come on. (suspenseful music) (Rosetta screaming) - Your daughter will be with us for the next 30 days. This is a legal requirement for all attempted suicides or until we can find out why she tried to take her life. And hopefully, we're going to be able to help her. Now our mandate here, is diagnosis, evaluation, and referral. Will give it no discretion in these matters. - You cannot possibly get close enough to Rose, in order to find the things that you need to help her. - Mrs. Entrada. - I have been with her for nearly 30 years, and I'm still learning how to communicate with her. - Please try to understand this is government bureaucracy. Now her physical wounds should be healed by the end of the month, and we'll be able to give you our much better assessment at that time. - Could I please see her now? - Yes, ma'am you can. - I sacrificed my entire career to have my children. The doctors said they would be a comfort in my old age. - We have noticed that Rosetta has a very unusual understanding of music. - You have to understand an artist so it's a blessing and curse. - You mean Rosetta is a musical aptitude? - Oh no, no Rosetta mimics, on artists fields we interpret it. - Ladies would you just excuse me for one moment please? - Sure. - Thank you. - Ma'am he didn't ask us here to talk about you. - I was only trying to explain about Rosetta. - Yes what? That she is some kind of a freak or that she can't feel the way that you feel. - Mrs. Basilio, Rosetta is resting comfortably this might not be the best time. - No, you told me that I could see her. - Well, yes, I did but apparently during her examination this morning Rosetta became very upset and I'm afraid that Dr. Banman has had to medicate her. Excuse me, please. (footstep) Please wait. - Rose? It's Franny. It's Franny. I want a full record of everything you've given her. - I was forced to sedate her for her own protection. Your daughter became very distressed when we discussed the events of the day of her accident. Mrs. Basilio, was there any disruption in her routine? - Good question. - No, nothing, I mean, she broke her leg and the doctor said she had to stay home. - Does she like chocolates? - Chocolates are her favorite. Thank you for concern doctor. But I want my daughter home with me as soon as possible. (footstep) - She's not going to stay with you ma'am, she's coming home with me. - I'm her mother she belongs to me. - You could stop me you've got another thing coming up. - The police can stop you. - Ma'am excuse me just calm down for a second. The issue at hand is what is best proposed. And I think I can take better care of her than you because I know her better than you do. - You want a daughter go have your own. (footstep) - Visiting hours are over in three minutes. - I know. (soft music) How did you hurt yourself? - Why are you just hurt? Why are you just hurt? - Because you drunk ammonia. - No pain. No pain in heaven. - Rosetta, do you want to stay here in this hospital - I wanna stay. Absolutely. - Do you want to stay here in this hospital or get out? Get out or stay? - I want to get out. I want to get out. - Good cause I want to get you out. Your mummy wants you home. But you have to help me if-- - It can't be. - No, no, it's gone now, it's gone now. It's okay. All bad things gone only good things left. Think of all the beautiful music we listen to. Like when we first went to opera, remember? When was that? When was that? - Mama. Papa. (singing) (mumbles) - Well stop day dreaming, I'm gonna go out without you. - Stop dreaming, stop day dreaming. - Franny had no business buying those tickets without telling me. Frank you shouldn't go. You have no idea that you might do there. - No, why can't you go she's seeing opera. Is her favorite person on this team. - Just such a day. What can you do just as happiness is something puzzles. - Just as her, absolutely. - Rose we are going. - Oh mama I paid so much for this tickets please. - We'll both look so beautiful. - Secret program from you okay honey. - I will. I will. - 62, the footsie Adele destino. - Oh my God. Oh my God. - Don't worry about your mother. You're so frustrating. - I'm straight home. (singing in foreign language) - Whooh. (suspenseful music) Whooh. Whooh. (suspenseful music) Whooh. (audience clapping) - Rose, she didn't really die. It's make believe. She's just acting, come on. Let's go, come on. Let's go, come on. Lets go get some ice cream, come on. Lets go get some ice cream. - Not dead absolutely. Sick though, very sick, very sick. - Snap out of it. That's what make believe is all about. - Make believe, absolutely. - That's why when the actress was on stage she could die. And when the curtain rolls, she could take her bow. - Take a bow, right. - You know where that actress probably is right now? Not in heaven. - In heaven eating spaghetti with uncle Vinny. (laughing) - No. (laughs) She's probably in her dressing room taking off a costume. - Oh my God, she is so frustrated. - Uncle Vinny is the one who really died, but is he was 90 years old. So he got to go to heaven, eat spaghetti with his friends. - Uncle Vinny in heaven, with his friend in heaven. - Heaven is the place where you can go like to another country where everything is sweet. Where no one is sick or poor or crippled. Now I could use my hand and you could be okay. There is no pain in heaven. - No pain in heaven, Franny. No pain in heaven, Franny. (humming) - Hi mama. - Where have you been? Do you know what time it is? - Yeah, oh, I'm sorry. - It's almost midnight. - Yes, we would have been-- - I've been worried sick. - The opera lasted longer than we-- - Don't lie to me. - We didn't do anything wrong. Juliet and Violet, they used to stay out for hours and nobody gave a damn. - That language is unacceptable in this house. I expect more from you Francesca. - She's very sick. - I know mama and I'm sorry. - Anything could have happened to your sister. Look at her, you know she's not normal. - Kelly, Kelly was 55. - Come on. - Don't ever do that to me again. - Doesn't matter come on. - Uncle Vinny, he is in heaven eating spaghetti. - Mrs. Basilio don't be too hard on them. - Mrs Syms, Fransesca is going to have to learn the difference between right and wrong which is going to survive in this world. - Looking for someone else to bother you. (suspenseful music) - It's all mama's fault. - I just wish it stop picking on us. - No Franny I know you don't understand, Tommy left home today, he went and got a job in Detroit and he didn't tell anybody till this morning. - I'm not surprised she's never done anything to make us want to stick around. - So now Juliet and Violet are gone, she's afraid of being left alone. (suspenseful music) - What did she say to you? - The kids are grown up now , and I'm not needed. - Rosetta needs you. She can't do that. - Franny. - I'll pay you, I will get the money from Papa. - Franny, Franny you got my pride. Come on now, it's not the end of the world. I'm only going to be across town with my sisters. Oh Franny baby you are always going to be all right. It's just Rosy I worry about. That is if nobody expect nothing from her then that's just the way she's gonna turn out. Yeah. (suspenseful music) - Rose, come over here. ♪ Help me now, I pray ♪ - No honey, no first them (suspenseful music) - [Man] It's noon day launch. - [Announcer] Active noon day lunch, so why not serve them something that is not only good for them but have lunch that they'll thoroughly enjoy.

(singing in foreign language) She can work. I'm asking you for a two week trial without pay. And I'll be there with her. And if it doesn't work out for all concerned then we'll just walk away. Very grateful that you gave us the opportunity. Excuse me. - I believe we may be able to manage something. - We clock in at 8:00 sharp. Can you keep to a regular schedule? - Oh yes. - Mrs. Evans will provide you with uniforms. A two week trial period.

If your fingers can't move fast enough, you shouldn't be here Dearie. You need rhythm. (soft piano music) - B flat. B. C sharp. - She really wants to work here guys. Give her a chance. - Regina Basilio. - Rosetta and I got a job today. - (mumbles) up to you. - And I'm gonna do anything that I can to give Rose another chance at a life further than just living just in this box. - But she has a life here with us. - This isn't good enough anymore. Only Francesca knows what her sister needs and feels. - Mrs. Syms had a pretty good idea and you took care of that, didn't you mama? - That's what this is about you wanna leave home with a clear conscience. Like Tommy and his sisters. You can't wait to leave me, can you? - This is not what this is about. - You wanna talk to your sister. Go ahead. You might apply those high expectations to yourself maybe you'll achieve something in life. Your sister Rosetta is what she is. This is her life. Even if it's not good enough for you anymore. (melodious piano music) - This (mumbles) for dinner tonight, all right? - This goes to the third floor, I'll show you the way. - All right. - She doesn't need you Miss Basilio. You look as though you'd be better suited to more organizational work with that arm you know. (footstep) (mumbles) (footstep) - Are you looking for someone in particular? - Are you a patient or are you just waiting to be admitted? - I'm visiting. (footstep) - And take your feet off the bed. This isn't a hotel you know. - Hey! Did you break your arm on the job? - No, I was trampled at birth by a rhinoceros. - Thank you Vieny. - No, no that's better.

(speaking foreign language) - Come on it's a small pleasure so let her play, huh?. - You know you're not supposed to be in here by yourself. - To behave just before you can go to one a month counts it. To behave just before you can go to one a month counts it. To behave... - What is she talking about? - What do you think she is talking about for two weeks you make this possible to your conscious she wants to go with you. - Rosetta the radio is on, Rosetta go listen to the radio. The radio Rosetta, go listen to the radio Rosetta go! - To behave (mumbles)... - Go (mumbles). - You know she can't with us. This rehearsal is very important. What if one of the students sings off pitch you know what she does when that happens. - Gives a damn. Franny takes her through lots of offers but you Regina never let her go nowhere. Would you should at least let her come to this rehearsal tonight. - What possible difference would it make to her. But you know she wants to go for you. Same reasons she wants to play for you. She wants, Regi, she wants you to love her. - You know you and Franny see her the way you want her to be not the way she is. Anyhow, she doesn't know what love is, she can't feel love. - And who can feel love? (indistinct chattering) - Come here, come here. Come here. (crowd chattering) - Would you rather go with them? - Well, those guys? - Mm-hmm. - Who wants to hang around with a bunch of rack rats. - You don't wanna see it? - Look, if you don't wanna see this show, let's go somewhere else. - It's not that. - What? If I was to hung up about your arm, I wouldn't have asked ked you. (soft piano music) (rhythmic piano music) - Wait a minute.

Because if we got mugged you'd be the one to protect me. Yeah, cause I remember thinking Nick watch it.

I can make room for her. Nicholas is okay about it. - I wish you wouldn't go on, huh? - I've tried to imagine today. My whole life and now it's here. I am so frightened, I feel like running away and hiding. Were you ever frightened? - Frightened of marriage? I was frightened of having a big career. I was frightened of success. God gave me a gift. And what did I do? I had children and I threw away every opportunity for myself. Marriage was safe. But for me it was a punishment for wasting my talent, but it'll be fine for you. It's good for you and Nick is, you know don't be frightened everything's gonna be okay. Waiting for you. (door bangs) (crowd applauding) (swelling music) - Rose, Rose come on sweetheart. Come on.

Oh my God. Thou shall not kill, thou shall not kill. - Rosetta, do you feel like killing yourself? How do you feel now? - Can't breathe. Can't breath. - [Doctor] From what I've observed, I think the girl suffers from multiple disorders. - [Doctor] I'd like to ever move to Stillwater. Try and get a release immediately. (soft music) - Let's go Rosy. - Can you help me please, Dr. Banman gave me permission to bring this is in. - Sure, I'll just have to check if I can find the extension. - Thank you. - Excuse me. - What's wrong with her? - Hazel spent a couple of weeks it's still water. They decided they had to control her violence. (swelling music) - Dr. Banman or Dr. Harkness which doctor did it. - I don't know what his name is. He wants Rosette to move to another hospital. - Which hospital? - Still lake, no still life whatever it was. He wants to run some tests on Rosetta. Franny brush my hair please. - What did you tell him? - I tell him? What do you mean what I did tell him. I told the good doctor that our family business is none of their affair. - Did they mentioned what kind of tests. - I don't wanna talk about it please Franny (sobbing) no more. - All right mama, what you have to do is go down to the hospital and sign the papers to release her. So I can bring her home. - Just like your brothers and sisters aren't you? You're all alike, you used me until you didn't need me and then you all left me and now you want to get Rosetta. You wanna take Rosetta away from me. I know it. What did you tell the doctors about... - I didn't tell them anything mama. We can get Rose back I'm not gonna take her away. We just have to stick together mama you and me. - Stick together. - Yes mama. You and me. You can walk in, you sign the papers, you walk out. That's all. - It's a damn job. Franny the job, you raise her expectations. (swelling music) - Mama I'm leaving for the airport to take that letter I'll meet you at the hospital. (swelling music) - Will you come with me, Dr. Harkness would want a word with you. (screaming) - No, no. No, no. No, I'm coming out like this. No (mumbles). - Mrs. Basilio, you all right maam. It's all right, it's all right please just come with me. - Your daughter has a severe mental illness Mrs. Basilio. - My daughter was fine until I let her come to this hospital. She's gotten worse since she's been exposed to this sick people in this place. What other explanation can you offer? - There is no explanation for this kind of mental illness. A congenital birth defect perhaps. - Oh I am to blame. Let me tell you something. When Rose was four years old, the doctors told me she'd have to be committed. They were the crazy ones. I've been able to take care of rose for 30 long years, because she was fine. - Please try to understand that we wanna help her. - This is the most humane option, please be objective. Still water is set up for this kind of investigative treatment. She will have professional care and if anything should happen to you what concerns me is that she may try to take her life again and the next time Mrs. Basilio she may succeed. Are you sure you could save your daughter's life? (somber music) - Rose? - Mrs. Entrada. - Where's my mother? We're taking Rose home today. - Andrew, you have to speak to her. - Why? - Your mother signed a release to send Rose to Still water. - What? No no get your hands off me. No let her go! Let her go, Rose. Let her go (door bangs) (phone ringing) - My flight got delayed. - I can't go any further now. She said she'll take Rose home and I believed her. I believed my mother. - Maybe it's a lot easier for her to face Rose. - But Nick what am I going to do. - We do whatever we have to do. - Get a lawyer or claim guardianship or something. Franny, I've had a month to think about this. If being married to you means a group package and sharing it with your sister Rose and I can handle that. And if it means moving back, we'll move back. (smooching) (soft music) - Mama she don't realize what kind of a place you're sending her to. This is not a hospital. This is where they tied you up on straitjacket, keep behind bars. She's going to die there. Our Rose is going to wither away she's going to crawl some deeper inside stuff that she is not going to be able to find our way out. Is that what you want mama? (breathing heavily) No, I know what went on here. And I'm not going to let you give up on her or yourself. Nick and I are coming back. He's gonna get his old job back. So I can be close to Rose. I have a document I want you sign. It says that I get full guardianship of Rose. From now on mama I make all the decisions for Rose. - I'm her mother, I only want what's best. - I'm not gonna take her away, I'll be here for both of you. - You're judging me. (soft music) - It'll be all right mama. (swelling music) - What's going on? - Just drive. (swelling music) (car revs) - Come on, here she go. (breaks screeching) - Hey. - Excuse me what is going on? You do not have permission - Yes I do, get out of the way. - Mrs. Basilio, is there a problem? - I want my daughter released doctor. - It's Franny. - Yes. (theme music) - Mama died August 4. It was hot, very hot. - Mama is in heaven now Rose. - In heaven eating spaghetti with uncle Vinny. - Mama is probably eating spaghetti with papa. - Papa died April 17. It was sunny day, a sunny day. - [Franny] She really missed him. She really missed him. - She really missed him absolutely. No pain in heaven, Franny. (somber music) - Hi. Say hi. - Hi. - Hi (mumbles). (theme instrumental music) (bird singing) (instrumental music)
