Leave me alone! Please don't! Mum! Get the hell out of here, you pigs! Mum! There's Habermann's whore. She's got to go! We're going to get that Habermann slut! You're going to Germany, you Nazi whore! - Get out! I don't want to see you any more! Eliskal - I'm not your friend! I'm Czech! Help meg Get out of here, you German whore! Jana! Jana! Melissa! Melissa! 1, 2, 3... August, that's not appropriate! What's that supposed to mean? In front of you or his brother? I'm so happy for YOU- Hans! The luggage! - Good morning, children. August, what are you doing here? Sister Bernarda introduced me to Jana. I haven't thanked her yet. Mayor? Please give the bride's certificate of baptism to the priest! And her birth certificate to Herr Habermann. At a time when he's not thinking of our foster child. - Let's go! Thank you. Karel! Let's discuss something really quick. Did you have a nice trip? - Yes thank you, Eliska. I still have to take care of a few marriage formalities. Is there something wrong? - No, everything's just fine. I just need to hand the baptismal certificate of the bride and groom to the priest. Let me have yours, too! May I pour myself a Slivovitz? I see, you only came around for some schnapps. Go on, help yourself! Thank you. Come with me for a minute! Excuse me. Strange. Look at this! The father's surname is: Silberstein. That means he's a Jew. It can't be helped; a birth certificate is a birth certificate. But this can't be true. After her mother's death, may she rest in peace, she was taken in by the nuns. And she was, after all, raised up in our belief. That's possible. But according to the officials, Jana is considered half-Jewish. So she's one. What does it matter? Can't they be married in church now? At least she was baptized. - It isn't about the church. Times are changing. - Oh yeah? Things are different out there? I'll tell you how different things are out there! August has the biggest mill around here and the biggest sawmill. And the most beautiful woman of them all. That's why you came to me. Because you didn't get her for yourself. And all of you envy him. Obviously, you did not understand what I meant. In Germany they've passed the Nuremberg Laws. And August is as German as an oak tree When we become part of the German Reich - We'll never be a part of the Reich! Never! Whatever, I'm just taking care of the formalities. You'd better keep the formalities to yourself! Do you understand? Do you know what Hartl said? That Jana is Jewish. Supposedly she's half-Jewish. How can she be Jewish if she grew up in a monastery? That's impossible. But on her baptismal certificate it says it in black-and-white; Silberstein. Hurry up out of here, Herr Habermann! It's bad luck to see the bride in her wedding dress before the wedding! It's okay, Eliskal The dress has been worn by another bride before anyway. I know, but Do you like it? - Eliska? Could you please give us some time to ourselves? Fine, I'm already gone. You're not even the lady of the house yet, and you're already giving orders. Well, if I have to wear the dress of the former lady of the house . Yes. Today, no one can sew like this any more, Jana. This is the traditional costume of my compatriots. -They're not mine. Do me that favour, please! From Ritter! The best jeweller in Prague. Did you inherit that too? Just like the dress? Yes, it's already in the fourth generation. And our daughter will wear it in the fifth But we're going to have a son, aren't we? Or don't you want a son and heir? First a daughter, then a son. This is the last thing my mother gave me. I always want to wear it. I always want to wear it. With this ring I thee wed. Cheers! May I borrow the bride for a moment? - Yes, you may. -Thank you very much. May I? Now it's my turn. He actually dared! Hans! Hans! Come on, you dance too! Your wife's in great demand I can't May I? I missed you. - I missed you, too. I love you. - You look so amazing. No, I do appreciate your offer, but I don't need your money. Don't be silly. You can pay me back whenever. Here you go. There's no hurry. That doesn't need to be done in 2 weeks. But thanks for the offer. It means a lot to me, my friend. - layout don't renovate now, it'll fall on your head. No. Keep your money. - I better stay out of this. I don't want the money. - Now please, don't get stupid. Just take it, and let's not talk about it again, okay? Alright, but I'll pay the money back eventually! It doesn't make sense. I know it and so do you. You just don't want to admit it. I don't understand. Just look at your brothers. Vaclav has three children with his wife. And Milan even has four. We don't have any. Wonderful. - Congratulations! You've a daughter. Jana! Melissa. Melissa. Yes! Yes! It's a girl! It's a girl! Let's call it a day! We're done working today! I'm a father! He did it! - I'm a father! He did it! He has a daughter! Melissa! - To your daughter! I'd be honored, if you'd be my daughter's godfather. No, I'm already your best man. And I don't want to be responsible for all of your sins. I guess, Hans will have to do it then. Where is he anyway? Stop it! - Besides, he has to have a drink to celebrate the birth of his niece! Hans? Hans! Not allowed to sing a song they like, just because the Czechs don't like it Hans! - August, did you hear? We'll belong to Germany again. It's going to be one again; one Reich, one nation, one Fuehrer! It's been agreed upon in Munich. - I know it now. You're going to be the godfather. Aren't you happy? - Of course. Otherwise I wouldn't have offered it to you. We'll be a part of the Reich. - You're lying. England and France can't abandon us like that. If they're doing that to us today, it's going to be their turn tomorrow. I'm not lying. It's been signed. Just listen to the Fuehrer! Maybe insensible for our democracy, perhaps this can be sympathetic. Because this is only a matter of three and a half million Germans! In 1918 it was the imperial and royal monarchy. And now we have the Nazis. Yes, yes. We always had to serve some masters as slaves. Talk Czech! Why? You heard it! We have German schools. All the public offices are also German! We belong to Germany. - Not yet. Not until October 1st. And it shouldn't matter to you if you get paid in marks or kroner, as long as you have work. History evolves in contradictions, said Marx. The Germans may take over the Sudetenland, but on the other hand they'll get rid of the Jews. And Marx, the one you honor so much, is also one of them. And Marx, the one you honor so much, is also one of them. Finally. Finally. Here come the vultures descending on their prey. Vultures? No. - Hail Hitler! - Are we already dead? Damn right we're dead! A corpse, that the world wants to get rid of as soon as possible. Well, what's the big change? What does it matter if the border is here or there - Oh well. You're German. Nothing much will change for you. But for us Czechs, everything will change. A lot of them will do much better. Hitler brought us work. We can sell our wood and our ?our all the way to Bavaria now. layout think this is all so great, take a ?ag and go wave it with the rest of them. Why don't you go, August? Just like the rest of your people. Sieg Hail! Hail Hitler! August! The time has come! Sieg Heil! Good morning. - Good morning! Welcome, gentlemen, welcome! - Hail Hitler! Hail Hitler, gentlemen! - Are you the director? Yes, Vaclav Pospichal. - Obersturmfuehrer Lutz. - Untersturmfuehrer Mueller. - Sieg Hail! Sturmbannfuehrer Koslowskil Clear the whole west wing! - Aye-aye, Sir! But this - You're Czech. Yes, but you can't pick your homeland Well, you have that chance now, Herr Pospichal. Today, we brought the Sudetenland back home into the Reich. Now you can choose. We don't have anything against Czechs. As long as they're not communists or Jews Are you a communist? Or a Jew? - No, no, no I'm of Czech heritage, but you don't have to worry about any of that with me. Very good. Except that you use the word "but?way too often for my taste. I suggest you erase it from your limited vocabulary immediately. As you wish, Herr Sturmbannfuehrer. What the hell is this noise? It's a baptism. Habermann, the owner of the sawmill, has a new baby daughter. Habermann. Just keep going, ladies and gentlemen! But in German if you please. The father is German? Yes, I'm German. And my wife is Czech. Couldn't you find a suitable German girl? The heart, after all, doesn't differentiate between races, Herr ...? Koslowski. Sturmbannfuehrer Koslowski. Will you allow me to offer you a drink, please? Who are you? - My name is Hartl. Hans Hartl. Mayor. and the newborn child. I noticed this by chance. Someone's stealing from you. I don't understand. Why would anyone do that? It's the war. Maybe it's a hiding place for their guns I don't know. The Sudetes were overrun. The Czechs will defend their fatherland. Their fatherland? With my wood? They're completely crazy now! August. It's your fatherland too. Please! The fatherland - that belongs to those who don't have anything else. I don't need the fatherland, I have my homeland. I don't understand why they built their hiding place so close to the path in the woods. And Eliska's cabin lies just above it. Are you kidding me? Eliska? No, not her. Her son. - Masek? I hope it's not him. - You need to worry about who the thief is. You have to deal with it one way or the other. I would even You're receiving visitors! Ceku, come here! Herr Habermann! We met at your child's baptism. Am I right? - Exactly. I have to talk to you What's going on, Sturmbannfuehrer? - One thing at a time! Would you show me your mill, Herr Habermann? Why not, Herr Sturmbannfuehrer. Come on! Excuse yourself! Do what you're told! In German, Brichta! Am sorry. Masek! My foreman! I don't understand you! All these Czechs! A Czech foreman in a German mill? Why? Because he's been working here the longest. Come along. Hail Hitler, Herr Sturmbannfuehrer! - Hail Hitler! Ludwig Kopp! - Finally a German! From Leitmeritz. Yes, Sir! - I'm sure, you're happy being back in the Reich. In my heart I've always belonged to the Reich. - Wonderful! We like to hear that. - Come along, Herr Sturmbannfuehrer. Around here, we use water power to make electricity! What's that water wheel for? It's supposed to remind us of the old days. What's a mill without a water wheel? It's important to us to keep our traditions alive. A Czech turbine! - Yes. So what? Which nationality is electricity? Get him out of here! I need to talk to you - alone. Leave us alone for a minute, Hora - As you wish, Herr Habermann! Hello. Another Czech? Hora is the best bookkeeper I ever had. And two times two is also four in Czech. So? Well We'll have to see. In the process of establishing the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, troops are being stationed in Stefansbad. We're also expecting soldiers from the whole Reich to come to the local health resort to be cured. That means, every week, 200 more kilos of wheat ?our in the kitchen. Doesn't the Wehrmacht deliver that to you? I didn't even bother asking them You'll deliver that to me. Where am I supposed to get 200 more kilos a week from? Take a tenth off from the people who bring wheat to the mill. That's what all millers do. - But we don't do that around here. Don't forget! I know what I'm talking about. Anton! What do you think you're doing? I don't give a shit what you need this wood for. It's still stealing! Unload it all. Right now! -You act like you don't know what's going on around you! You're crazy] Stop in You don't have to worry about seeing us again! Maybe you'll hear from us - I'll see you tomorrow morning! You'll come to work. And we'll just forget the whole thing. But not a single splinter of my wood disappears ever again! Is that clear? Here you go. I married a thug who likes to fight in pubs I'm not a thug. And that didn't happen in a pub. - Yes. And he took a piece of wood, because he didn't have the courage otherwise These days, no German is safe from a Czech. And the Czechs are not safe from the Germans. What will those two do on top of that? What do you mean, "do on top of that?? Iodine burns. You're going to fire them, right? At least that Masek Maybe he's not a bad person, but he's no right to attack his boss like that. I already told them I'd forget the whole thing. Gentlemen, let's call it a day. - Get back in your place. We're stop soon. A little more movement would help, and less sitting behind your desk. What should I do about it? I have too much work to do. That's true, August. But you seem to be pretty out of breath too. Keep going! I've heard you had problems with Masek. -What kind of problems? You know, I sometimes hear things A mayor needs to know what people gossip about in his town. Nobody gossips around here. Get rid of him! He's a danger to us all. Definitely not to you! Hans envies me for my mill, I envy him for his youth. So we're both envious of each other, but we have nothing to say to each other. Do you think if you went to their oath of allegiance, things would improve? Scarcely. He wan ted money for the uniform I didn't give him any. Speak German! You Czech pigs! What in the world do you think you're doing? That Czech pig knows German after all. Then sing with us. The ?ag HP We, Let him have it! These filthy Czechs! Let's get out of here! Hurry! Let's go! Go. go! Where did you get that pistol from? Hora What will you tell Karel if he sees us? - He's not going to see us. I sent him to the forestry office to take care of some bills So no one will - No one's going to see us. You promised me an heir. I want him now. You will be glorious Even if we perish Forward, forward Can you hear the fanfare Forward, forward The young are unaware of danger May the goal be oh so ambitious Do you see him? - Leave him alone, or do you want him to make a fool of you? I'm already his laughing stock. A few months ago, he came to me and wanted money for the uniform. I told him that I didn't want him to wear those rags and now look at him! I gave it to him He has his oath tomorrow. He wouldn't be able to go without it. It is the year 1940! Right here in Sudetengau, here at the border of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, here in Eglau, here you must and you will succeed in the fight for the Fuehrer, our German fatherland, our race, against Bolshevism and Judaism. Now everyone, take your dagger in commemoration of this day. Carry it with pride as a sign of your unconditional devotion to the Fuehrer! You, Anton Bachler... Good luck, my boy! - Hail Hitler! You, Hans Habermann Good luck, my boy! - Hail Hitler! You, Richard Dohm... Yes - You're doing a great job. Looks good on you! You should also have children - Herr Habermann! Hurry! The SS, the Sturmbannfuehrer! They're raiding the saw mill! Watch the little one! Ceku! Come here! Where's Masek? Are you Masek? Who's Masek? Masek?! Are you Masek?! Search it! - Hail Hitler! I want to see your papers, and I mean now! He's up there. Masek's upstairs. Lutz! Mueller! Masek! Come on down here, my friend! Stop! Masek! What's going on here? - Herr Habermann! I assume that you, as a respectable German have a keen sense of justice. I don't understand you, he didn't do anything. - How do you know that? We found a hidden weapon arsenal in the forest, that was covered with boards from your sawmill. - I sell wood! What people do with it, is not my concern. The hiding place was very close to the cabin, that belongs to Masek's mother. Seize him! That doesn't prove anything. It might have been kids. Kids, Herr Habermann, don't hide MP34 sub-machine guns! We simply want to ask your worker a few questions. If he doesn't know anything, nothing'll happen to him. No good reason for you to bring a whole army here. - And something else. The ?our delivery yesterday was full of sawdust - I've nothing to do with that. A consequence of you having a lot of Czechs working for you. I was going to discuss that with you, but since your brother volunteered for the Wehrmacht Excuse me? - Didn't you know? Naturally we're not paying for yesterday's delivery of ?our. Hail Hitler, Herr Habermann. What are you going to do now? - What are you going to do now? Why don't you ask me what I can do! There is nothing I can do! Don't yell at me, you're frightening me. - That's exactly why I didn't want this. First Henlein then the Hitler Youth! This'll end in the cemetery. No question about that. He's only 19! Jana! Jana! Where are you going? Hans is gone. Somewhere with the Wehrmacht. He went to enlist and didn't tell anyone about it, not even August. Oh my God. - What if they send him to the Russian front? But you can't go there. Why not? Every Monday we deliver 200 kilos of first class ?our. So I can go there! - Jana! The ?our is okay, but And I'm not? Hail Hitler! Whom do you wish to see? - Sturmbannfuehrer Koslowski. Name? - Habermann. Jana Habermann. Identification. Just a moment. Room 110 But not until you return. What happened? Hey, this is Jana's bike! Nothing. I only borrowed it. She went to see Koslowski in Stefansbad - about Hans. Koslowski can't do anything about it He will send her home. Jana's Jewish, August. - What nonsense are you saying! Jana's Christian, probably more so than the rest of us. How many of us were baptized directly by the nuns in the monastery? -That's the thing! She was baptized, but not until after her mother died. -True. Her mother died shortly after she gave birth, and her father is unknown. - He isn't! Karel saw her birth certificate. His name was Silberstein. I'm not a magician, Frau Habermann. I can't arrange for Hans to come back. We need him, Herr Sturmbannfuehrer. We're the ones who deliver your ?our. - You have 20 employees. Whether you have 2 sacks of ?our more or less depends on your brother-in-law? Not just 2 sacks more. He takes care of the whole mill. I wasn't born yesterday, madam. Hans Habermann volunteered to take up arms. He's a good German patriot. But he's about as much to do with the mill as myself. In other words nothing at all There's one more thing I'd like to tell you, Frau Habermann. Something you may not even know yourself. Or perhaps you do. You're an extraordinary woman after all. Extraordinarily beautiful for such a small town as Eglau. Why don't you wear your pretty jewellery? My cross has more meaning to me. - You shouldn't live in Eglau, but in Berlin. - Unter den Linden. - I don't understand you. Doesn't matter. What kind of sacrifice would you make for your brother-in-law? Jana! - August! What's the hurry, Herr Habermann? I just had such a nice conversation with your wife. I just wanted to convince the Sturmbannfuehrer, that Hans can't simply up and leave like that. - And I've tried to explain to your wife, that it's out of my hands where the Wehrmacht send off its soldiers Please forgive us, Herr Sturmbannfuehrer. My brother's enlistment in the Wehrmacht was unexpected for all of us. To be honest with you, we don't know what to do. Be proud of him. And don't be afraid, we'll be victorious on all fronts. The German Wehrmacht can't be defeated. I'm sure he'll return safely. Herr Habermann! You can have your foreman back! We knocked him around a little bit. You're right, he's innocent. Unfortunately. August. August. Let me go! Are you insane? - Do you know what you just did? You staked your life! - I wanted to help Hans! -You can't help him. And if Koslowski knew that - I had to give it a try! You even said it was my fault, too! - I said a lot, but I didn't mean any of it! Too bad! I used to really look up to you, because whatever you said you meant! Too bad it isn't like that any more! - Now listen to me. Do you know why you can't ever go back there again? - No, and I don't care. Now you will listen to me. If you hit me ever again, I'll take Melissa and leave and you'll never see us again! August? Pospichal Habermann. - I want to warn you, my esteemed Herr Habermann. Some pamphlets showed up. Sturmbannfuehrer Koslowski and his officers are advancing toward your mill. What kind of pamphlets? What kind of nonsense is that? I beg you If you have anything at all to do with those pamphlets I don't know anything about any pamphlets. I was under the impression that they're on their way to you precisely because of these pamphlets. Thank you for your call. But I really don't We have to stick together, Herr Habermann. This war will come to an end It can't last forever. Then it will be important to know who was on whose side. Don't you think? Get out! Move, move, move! Hurry UP! We will now read out your names. If you hear your name, say "here", clearly and loudly. Do you understand? Pistek. - Here. Glotz! - Here. Kopp! - Here, Herr Obersturmfuehrer! Svoboda! - Here. Navratil! - Here. Masek! - Here. Brichta! Brichta! Pavel Brichta! The worker Pavel Brichta! Do you see your worker Brichta anywhere here? Was he here yesterday? - Brichta was helping me in the forest all day yesterday. And today as well. We have to cut down old oaks. Brichta is very knowledgeable about forestry. Read! German! "The German Army reports heavy losses at Stalingrad. Already two hundred thousand dead - Read. "In the battle of Kursk, the German Tank Army was defeated.? Read! - "Germany is retreating because of the great losses at the eastern front." This shit is appearing in the entire area around Eglau. Someone is trying to undermine the German morale. And what makes you think it might be one of us? There aren't that many possibilities after all. We have vehicles moving from here into the whole area. Right along with the shipments of ?our, it's easy to haul these scribbles. Did you ever see such filth, Herr Hora? I asked you a question! Have you ever seen anything like this? No. I'd like to know, what you think about this, Herr Hora Who'd distribute filth like this? I don't know. - Oh yes, I believe you know who. Koslowskil - One less traitor. Keep going! In about 2 hours I'll have Horas'pistol on the table. Hail Hitler! - Sieg Hail! March off! Come on, come on! Faster! He probably deserved it Where've you been, you pig? Where've you been? - In the forest! Karel can verify that! That's not where you've been! - Herr Habermann, what happened? That's what the others said, that Karel lied to protect you. I never cared what you guys did after work. Now it's falling back on me. Where have you been?! - Out! With something that had to be distributed! You've gone crazy. All of you. Playing partisans, all driving around with some kind of pamphlets. And Hora's dead. That's the risk, but we all knew it. And what am I supposed to tell his widow now? What? If Masek had kept his mouth shut, none of this would have happened What's that supposed to mean? - That he's a traitor. Jesus Christ! That's not true! - Hora told me Masek is the only one at the mill who saw the pamphlets. - No more pamphlets at the mill! I 'd like to ask you a favour. - Usually it's orders, but today it's a favour? Can Masek stay with you? - What do you mean? I'm supposed to let him stay with me? - I can no longer keep him at the mill. Why should you? Not only did he steal from you, he also informed against you. It's a miracle they didn't beat him up. Do you also believe he betrayed Hora? Why did Koslowski let him walk? After grilling him for three days, he let him go and even apologized Tell me why you're sticking up for Masek? Then I'll find something for him. Why is this so important to you? Do you think that, as a good German, I'd want to protect a spy? Of course not. I'll take him either way. But if he gets into any more trouble he's finished. Drinking water! - Here! - Come here quick! We only have 10 minutes! - Where you taking them? To Bayreuth. There's no more hospitals in Kursk and Stalingrad. Water! Water! Thirsty! Thirsty! Where are we? - In Eglau.Sudetenland. Jana! - Yes? - Come! I can't right now. - Come! Is he dead? - No, his pulse's weak, but I can still feel it. I can't feel anything. - I'm sure he's going to make it. Hans! - Jana! You're home. - Bayreuth? We have to get out of here, come on! - Give me a hand! - Have you gone crazy? I'm not going to leave him here. Come on, help me! I want to go, too! I don't want to go to Bayreuth. I was already there. If I go back there, I'll die Take me with you Get the cart! - Yes. Hans. What's this supposed to mean? - You're at home in Eglau. No. No. I can't stay here. Of course you can. Calm down. - I need to be in hospital. It's all good. - The doctors will heal me. I'm not a deserter. Where's my uniform? - You don't need a uniform. The war is over for you. Are you out of your mind? That's all I have. You always said keeping your word is a matter of honor in the Habermann family. That only counts for those who've earned the honor of the Habermanns. That madman with the mustache didn't earn it. Don't talk like that. He just wants to raise up our people. Jana! He can't stay here. - I know. Eliska. Can't you accommodate Hans in your cabin in the woods? I can't do that. What if anyone finds out? Nobody's going to find out. It's not any more dangerous than protecting your son. You know why you're protecting my son. He can stay, but I'm not going to take care of him. I'll take care of him. How many sacks was that? This was the 14th, Herr Pospichal. - That's enough! Thank you. Pardon. - Thank you. What's this? Pills. Pain killers mostly. And also some bandages. And a little morphine, in case the pain gets too bad. Thank you very much, but I'm doing fine. And you really don't know anyone who could use it? How do you know about this? No one must find out, do you understand? He who keeps his ears open should have a lazy mouth. You don't need to worry one bit. layout need additional supplies, you can call me at anytime. You do have my number, don't you? Here you are. This is very generous of you. Thank you. Even though I didn't mean it like that. How did you mean it then? - I already told you last time, that this war is going to end some day. And one day it'll get me into trouble that I was director of a German hospital. If the time comes I'd be very grateful if you remembered who helped you. Hello Hans. - Hello. How do you feel? Do you have a fever? I brought you fresh things. Sausage. And bread and cheese. Take a bite. They mustn't hear you! Hans I'm so sorry. But you probably won't walk normally again. I don't believe you! You're lying! The doctors told me, once I get well, I can go back and fight again. Excuse me, please! I need some ?our, could you please grind me some? -Whenever you want But without papers, without anything. Without an invoice. Yes, sure. As always. - Yes, thank you. We thank you. Thank you very much. We're Christians after all. - Jana Good Christians! Doesn't anything matter to you? Even Hans? I don't believe that. - I have to tell you something. - Melissa! Back when I yelled at you, when I beat you. When you went to see Koslowski. - That was so long ago. I forgot all about that. This is very important. Go to him, August! I'm begging you, he needs you. No. Hello Hans! Hello Jana. What is that? We're going for a walk in the woods. Hans! - I'll never again be able to walk without these damn crutches! Be happy you're still alive after all. And your leg, they'll fix it up again after the war. They're looking for me. Nonsense! They have bigger problems than to look for you. - But I'm a deserter. Come back! Hide! Maybe they're looking for you ..., Masek! Do you speak German? No. German, no. - We're lost. I don't understand. Health resort Stefansbad. Where? Show me on the map where we're now. What do you want? Weapons? The watch? Please. Then do it! You stupid Czech! Go ahead and shoot me! I'd do the same myself. You can't just go in there! - Let go of me! I never want to see that guy again! -Who? - You know exactly who I'm talking about! I told him, he couldn't come in, this late at night! Eliskal Karel can visit me anytime. But as you wish. I don't care why you back him up. Masek is a cowardly pig. What happened? - You'll hear about it anyway. But I want to tell you first hand. We were driving through the woods, and there were 2 soldiers. They didn't want anything from us, and Masek shoots one of them. He aims his gun and shoots him, just like that, without any reason. August! Do you know what happened? I saw everything. You were there? What else could I have done? I had no other choice. He begged me to let him go. He was begging me; Let me live! And I had to kill him. I'm so sorry. Is this true? I told you all along you need to get rid of Masek. Please connect me with Herr Pospichal. I'm a cripple. - Don't talk about yourself like that! Yes, you will walk with a limp. So what? There are worse things! Not the leg, damn it, not the leg! Can't you understand that? Something happened to me here! They killed 2 soldiers. Boys like me! And I didn't care. Instead of rushing there to help them, I was simply happy I wasn't in their shoes. A deserter. Now I'm a deserter. Now I am! You're not a deserter! Yes, I am. You've suffered more pain than a 20-year-old boy can bear. I'm happy you've come, Father. Actually, I was going to come to see you, but as you can see, I still have things to do around here. I have heard that - under certain conditions of course - you know how to get out of here. - Who told you that? Someone above me. Someone who cares enough to make sure I'll still be around in the future. Danger threatens. - I studied with Alois Hudal in a seminary. Today, he's a Vatican priest. And he knows all the odds and ends. He'll help you escape. - Where to? Argentina is one possibility. That means you owe me 20 lives here in Eglau. 20 lives for 2 dead soldiers. And I'll take these 20 lives. The question is who do we pick. How about your friend Brezina, for instance? And what, if a Czech's life is valued at a tenth of a German's life, what would that be worth? What am I supposed to do with Reichsmark? Who knows how much it'll be worth tomorrow? I think it was at your daughter's baptism, when I saw your wife wearing such beautiful jewellery. Ritter. From Prague. I see you don't leave any unfinished business. - One earring with 2 diamonds. For 2 Czechs. Now there are only 19 left. The second earring. 18. 15. 16. 14. - 101 13. - This is set with 82 diamonds. - 13. 10. - 12 and no more. You don't know how many of these we've already collected from the Jews And for that, you will let the remaining 12 live This is the most valuable piece of jewellery in Eglau. Sorry, but 10 Czechs must be executed. In response to the death of the 2 German soldiers. Certainly you understand. I have superiors to answer to as well. Now write the 10 names for me. You know the people here, I don't. You know who deserves to live, and who doesn't. I'm not going to do that. I'm sure there's someone you always wanted to kill. So start writing! You had a bad dream. - No, mayor. I didn't have a dream He wants 10 Czechs as revenge for the 2 soldiers who were killed. Am I on the list? - I didn't see your name on it. He even tried to make him write down 20 names. But then, luckily, Herr Habermann promised him all his jewellery. Then he decided that 10 Czechs will be enough. They'll be shot. What? Just your name? You said yourself that 1 German is worth 10 Czechs. Here is the list of all the Czechs who live in Eglau. 370 total. So we pick every 37th name. 37, 74 Of course, I could end up selecting a friend of yours. But that can't be helped any more. Do you know August You don't mind if I call you August? If we have a list, then we won't miss any information. August? Madam! Excuse me! I didn't know you had company. Excuse us. What a coincidence. Just today! received an extremely interesting document from mayor Hartl. Do you know what this is? The birth certificate of your beautiful wife. And do you know what the document states? Racial identity; Jewish. Why did you never tell me about this? - I didn't know anything about it. And personally, I don't think it's important. Even though marriages between German citizens and Jews are explicitly forbidden? I know. You don't need to recite the Nuremberg laws to me. I personally prefer "Law to protect the German blood and German honor". But you're right. It doesn't matter any more now, so let's go. Where to? - We will get the 10. And I'd like you to accompany me. I do this on a whim. So, let's go. Get in! Turn that damn ringing off! Herr Habermann! Herr Habermann! Herr Habermann! Father! A family trip of the Habermanns. How nice! Come on, let's go! Let's go. Madam Can't you at least spare our daughter this awful sight? What are you thinking? Even the young people must learn who we are. Come on, get out! August 9! I count only 9 Czechs, mayor. But I can't get the number 10 out of my head. August, no! Don't do this! No! But not in front of my wife and daughter. What where you thinking? I'm giving you your life. Your life as a German. But a German and a Jew? - I'm not Jewish. I'm not Jewish! You better have your husband explain - What kind of nonsense is this? I'm Catholic. I had a normal baptism! Your father. - I never had a father. His name was Silberstein. How do you know that? Why did you never tell me? - I was going to when I found out, but then I love you I love you too. Enough of this! Leave me alone! The rest of your family jewellery. Your wife won't need it at the camp. You pig! Come on! Melissa! Melissa! A little faster! August! August! August! As you can see, all the documents with your name have been destroyed. Marvelous, Herr Sturmbannfuehrer, marvelous. You now have a past, which will give you a new future. Well, yes Occupants will come and go in this country, Herr Sturmbannfuehrer. Only we Czechs will be here forever. For you, 60 gold ducats! Nice pieces. I think the time to leave has come. Goodbye, Herr Sturmbannfuehrer. Koslowski. Kurt. Kurt! One moment! Although, starting right now, it's no longer my duty to give you any news, my dear Kurt, you should know the Russians are already advancing up the main road. I have my way of getting information. It's best to travel through the forest, that way you can bypass the main road altogether. And the Russians as well It's a real shame for you, Herr Pospichal, but who knows We might see each other again. - Good bye. It's me. He's leaving. He'll drive through the woods just like we agreed. What's going on? - Every national comrade will now be a comrade. What do you mean? - Pack your bags, the Germans are gone! - Finally! Get out of here! As long as you don't forget who gave you a place to hide! Thank you so much! Stop! Hans? Hans Habermann. Herr Sturmbannfuehrer! Herr Koslowski. You've been a good boy, Hans. You should try to get out of here soon, too. Very soon. I'm going to stay. This is my home, Herr Sturmbannfuehrer. If that's what you want When there's a storm moving in, the animals in the woods can usually sense it and disappear somewhere. Man should learn from the animals. I can sense what's coming, just like the animals can sense a storm. The rumbling you're hearing isn't thunder. Oh yes it is! And you've known it for a while. When you hear it come closer, it's time to leave for awhile. You must escape. I'm begging you. This mill is already 110 years old. Did you know that? Hey, are you even listening? - Yes, I am. But you're not listening to me. 110 years. Four generations of Habermanns were raised here, have lived here - August! - died here and now rest in the cemetery at the church. Not the fourth generation. That's you, and you're not dead yet. Yes, I am. I just haven't been buried yet. You're still too young to be talking like that. Pull yourself together and get out of here. I'll take care of everything here. - After all your wife is German, too. Will you send her away, too? - I'll hide Martha for a few days. But I won't send her away. It's a completely different situation. - Why? Am I even more German than she is? No! But don't forget one thing. You're very rich. Oh, so you're not sending me away because I'm German. You're worried about me, because I have money. I'm not going anywhere. This is my home. But take this. What are you doing here? Wait, don't be afraid! Don't be afraid. It's war. Take your little one home. Go! Martha! - Yes? - Come with me! I can't leave, I just started baking a cake. - There's no time for that! Where are you taking me? - I've prepared a shelter for you to hide. Can I at least wash my hands? - You can wash them there. I'll bring you water. And also something to eat. And everything else you will need! There's a candle too. I'm not going there. You have to go there! When they search for Germans, they mustn't find you! But I can't go! I'm expecting a child. Finally, our child! I'm so happy! But you need to hide! It's too dangerous for you here! Come on! August! August! August! August! German son of a bitch! I saw you with that SS man! You didn't even look at me, you bastard! Get the hell out of here! Get out, you bastard! We don't want any traitors here! Our partnership with the Germans is finished! August! Now get up! Alright. Now you'll come with us! You pig! You bastard! Take him! You betrayed us! Now we'll get even! You'll pay for that! Too bad you can only croak once instead of 9 times over! Get out now! What are you doing here? Stop it. Don't do that. Let's get out of here, quickly! Close it! Come on, close it! - Why? What are we doing here? - We're taking what we're entitled to! Put the chairs on the table! - What? Turn all the chairs upside down and put them on the table. Like this? - How else do you think? Hurry up! Jesus Stop! That's enough. Put that chair right there! - Which one? Which one do you think? Turn it around. Just a minute! I'm not a thief. Mother! We'll only take what belongs to us. Under normal circumstances, it'd also belong to you. What does that mean, "under normal circumstances?? When old man Wilhelm Habermann died August and Hans inherited everything. You didn't get anything. - Why would he give anything to me? Back then, I was a young maid, and all he had to do was take me. And so he had his way with me. But for a wife he preferred rich Frau Ilse. And all I was left with was you, Masek. All these years, why didn't you tell me? We made a deal. I was to remain as silent as the dead. And the two of us would always have a job at the mill. Forever. Still, I think he should have included you in his will. But whatever. Let's go. - Wait, the things you just said I don't want them to find us here. - What you just said changes everything! What will it change? -When the Habermanns disappear after the war Come on, go! - If those two disappear, I'll still be here! Or not? Now we'll check his study! And the safe! - Calm down. Just calm down and take it easy! Leave that alone! - Now I'm officially seizing everything! We're all here officially! - Nothing will be seized from here! Not one thing! Who do you think you are?! Who gives you the authority to open your big mouth here? -This is my right! The rights of the mill owners! You've obviously gone mad! Do you know who my real father was? My father was old man Habermann! And since now, neither August nor Hans have any rights to the property, the mill and sawmill belong to me, right? So you are a genuine Habermann? You could say that, yes. Then you're a German. No, you can't look at it that way. Although my father was old man Habermann, on my mother's side I'm Czech. So you can't do anything to me, not a thing! You think so? Stop right now! Let go! Hands off! This doesn't belong to you! You bastards! Get the hell out of here! Get out! Tell us! Tell us! He wants to say something. Be quiet, he's trying to say something! What? Where did he hide it? - He gave everything to Koslowski to save our lives. - The pig! - He's lying! He always was a liar! He's lying! He's lying! He's dead. He's dead! Hurry! Get out! Where's August? - Get out! Leave me alone. August! Where's August? Why don't you look for him yourself, you German slut. Look for him. Look for him It's all your fault. Have a good trip, Herr Habermann. Now it's your turn, my darling! Jana! Hands off! Hands off! Have you all gone crazy? She's a Czech! She's Czech! She's no Czech! She's German! Habermann's whore! Together with her little bastard. I know everything - Don't touch her! Get on the train! Get on the train! August! - August? He's already waiting for you there. Comrades, get rid of these German pigs! Hurry! - Hans! Where's August? Karel, where's August? That's enough now! Jana! From August. I didn't want to give you this in front of them. Mum, I'm freezing. Years later, forester Brezina formally accused mayor Hartl and his accomplices of murdering August Habermann. But since his body was never recovered, there was no proof of anything, and all formal charges against them were dropped. English sub titles edited by Darryl Wiggers for Corinth Films. ?
