What do you see beyond this wall? Picture it. You've got an imagination. Go ahead. What I see is a small town in the Midwest. Handful of churches. Some places for the farmers to get drunk together. Maybe a salon for their wives to do their hair on the holidays. I visit these places. These are the people who send us our profits, who send us your wages. I make movies, Judy, but it's your job to give those people dreams. The economy's in the gutter, and they pay for you. And I'll tell you something else. In every one of those towns, believe me, there's a girl who's prettier than you. Maybe their nose is a little thinner at the bridge. They have better teeth than you. Or they're taller or they're slimmer. Only, you have something none of those pretty girls can ever have. You know what that is? No, sir. You have that voice. It'll maybe take you to Oz, someplace none of those pretty girls can ever go. Still, I'm told you're unhappy. Well, no, sir, not unhappy. I'd just maybe like a little more time. Time? For what? I don't know. Maybe to go to the pictures like those other girls do. The thing is, those other girls will grow up to be cashiers and farmers' wives and elementary school teachers. And they'll see their skins roughed up through housework. Is that what you want, Judy? To be just a housewife? To be just a mother? Out there, you'd have to put away that voice of yours. Forget it exists. But here, with us, with your family, that voice will make you a million dollars before you're 20. Those average kids, they're all loved, in their way. I can see how you may be drawn to it, from time to time. Their small lives. Not too dangerous. Not too exciting. They're where they belong. And maybe you feel like you're like them. But really, you're not. You live in another world entirely. They just look like you. But if you truly wanna go join them, it's your decision. We'll shake hands and you can walk through our gates. I guarantee it's all there, the rest of America, just waiting to swallow you up and forget all about you. Like a raindrop falling into the Pacific. Who cares? Who even notices? Of course I wanna stay with the studio, LB. Any girl would kill to be Dorothy. I'm just terribly sorry if... I didn't even say anything to anyone. You're my favorite, Judy. - Who else have we had in? - Shirley Temple this morning. Everybody loves Shirley. Let's see how Judy measures up. Joey, did you grow again? I guess. Oh! Well, could you at least do it all at once? Just get it over with one weekend? 'Cause it's a new pair of pants every time you add an inch. Dad says vitamins make me grow. So, we'll cut those out. Oh, I'm kidding, darling. It's a wonderful thing to have a son big enough he can carry his mother to the car. Lorna, sweetheart, let me see you. What are we doing first? Oh, the usual. Is that okay? - Yeah. - You look gorgeous, sweetheart. - So, I have your money. - Oh. Crowd's gonna go crazy - out there. - Aw. So, it's $150. Uh, I know it's not maybe - what you're used to, but... - No, no, I appreciate it. - All right. - I do. - Okay, you ready? - Sure. - Follow me. - Go on. All right, folks... We'll just do what we did in New York, yeah? Hope you're ready. Put your hands together. Okay, let's go, let's go. How are you tonight, Altadena? One of Hollywood's true legends, Miss Judy Garland. Well, I've got something very special planned for you this evening. I've brought my children along. What a journey. I'm sorry it's so late. How you doing, Georgie? I'm okay, thank you, Miss Garland. And you? Oh, stumbling along. Any messages while we were out of town? Uh, I don't think so. Okay. Well, could I just have my key, please? Let me check something with Mr. Horowitz. One moment. Can we get room service, Mama? I missed dinner. Sure, sweetheart. Anything you want. - Miss Garland. - Oh, please. I'm Judy. - Could I have a word? - Can it wait? We're just desperate to get to bed. Lorna, darling, tell Peter what you want and he'll take care of it. A hamburger and fries, please. Oh, and, you know, I'd love a bowl of soup. And a drink. Vodka rocks. You know what, forget the soup. I'm too tired to even wield a spoon. I'm very sorry, but your suite has been released. What do you mean, "released"? It's not still attached to the building? Where exactly has it gone? I believe your account was in arrears. Oh. No. No, I don't... I don't think that's the case. - The room got released. - So un-release it. Hand it back. We need to sleep in it. - Is everything okay? - No. No, darling. These people have let us down very badly leaving us stranded without so much as a change of socks. Everything is in storage. I could have rooms anywhere in this city, but I chose this hotel. Well, not anymore. I wouldn't let my worst enemy stay here. Let's just go. Outraged. Come on, sweetheart. - Please don't go to sleep now. - No, no, no. These are the other ones. - Where are we going? - The Roosevelt. Didn't we stay there last year? Sure. But they like us. Mama. Could we head toward Brentwood, please? Joe, get the bell, would you, darling? So, you wanna stay? No. And they're only staying tonight. - So, they have school tomorrow. - I know that. They slept in the cab. They'll be fine. I probably paid more on cab fare tonight than I would've on a hotel. - What about tomorrow night? - What about it? - Come on. Don't play that game. - Well, you're needling me, Sid. - Just ask me a straight question - All right, where are my children gonna sleep tomorrow night? Wherever I tell them. Hi, sweetheart. - Something wrong? - Hey. - I... I can't sleep. - You want some milk? - Come here. - No, you go to bed. We'll bring it to you, okay? Don't worry. Where are the mugs? I moved them. They're where the glasses were. Ridiculous. Couldn't you just take a role in something? I'm "unreliable." And "uninsurable." That's what the ones who like me say to my face. So, thank you for that. Leave me out of it. "Judy, leave it to me and you'll be back on top." - Look how that turned out. - "Where is she, Sid? Is she sick? - Is she coming in today?" - Don't. - "Where's your star?" - Don't. "You realize we're gonna have to sue you both, Sid." - Don't start. - "Why are you even protecting her, Sid? - What's going on?" - Oh, shut up, Sid! You can't turn up here at one o'clock in the morning - and expect... - I know they should be in bed! It just doesn't always work that way. And it gets late because nobody wants to pay to see me at 2:00 in the afternoon. And I have to work, because they need things. They need an education, Judy. They need ten hours of sleep. Oh, just to hell with this. Just call me a cab. I want custody during the school year. Over my dead body. Well, no one would be surprised, believe me. Give me the milk. Give me the milk! It's a little late for all that, don't you think? Why don't you see yourself out? Can we go here, please? ♪ Got to tell you true ♪ Thank you. ♪ I got to tell you true ♪ ♪ Oh, brother Jack ♪ ♪ You goin' with sister Sadie ♪ ♪ When you ought to be home ♪ ♪ With your old lady... ♪ This house is fabulous. Look at that. She shows. What, am I early? - You look fabulous. - Liza, darling, you look beautiful. I can't believe you came. What are you doing here? Well, I wanted to see you, darling. Are you in L.A. for a while? Well, I never know, you know, these days. I have a show opening in two days. - You do? Really? - Mm. Yeah. - And how do you feel about it? - I don't know. I know my lines and it's all in my range. I guess I haven't really thought about it that much. You're not even a little anxious about it? - Well, should I be anxious? - Well... I mean, no. No. Um, we were off to go dance. Will you come with us? No, no. No, you go. I'll catch up to you. Excuse me. This is for you. We can't have the world's greatest entertainer out here without a drink. Frank Sinatra's here? Frank is great, but he is no Judy Garland. I bet it kills him. - I'm Mickey, by the way. - Judy. So, you live in Los Angeles, Mickey? Mm. No, I manage a bar back in New York. I'm out here looking at a business opportunity. Hmm. You ever make your own cocktails? - Hmm. - This place, we sell the booze, and all the mixings and stuff is on the tables, so you get to invent something of your own. You know, it's fun. People drink more 'cause they wanna be part of the next new thing, you know. - Oh? - I don't know. You have to have ambitions, right? Well, I used to have them. I found they gave me the most terrible headache. Well... if you wanna create the Judy Garland martini, that's me. - Mr. Mickey Deans. - Yep. Hmm. You have kids, Mickey? Uh, no. No, I don't. Hmm. Well, you shouldn't. It's like living with your heart on the outside of your body. Find a hobby or something, like canasta or birdwatching. Well, I play piano, actually. - Oh, you do? - Yeah. You play anything or you just sing? Just sing? Sorry. That's not what I... - Did that come out wrong? - My entire childhood I must've slept five hours total. It's a wonder I learned to use cutlery, let alone play the violin. We've changed our minds. We're gonna head to Andy's place. Will you come? I don't know. I think I might stay. Well, you don't know anyone here. Well, everybody seems to know me. Besides, I wanna stay somewhere for longer than five minutes. You go. Have fun. - Mom? - I'm fine. Go. I love you. - I love you. - I love you. - Voilà. - The masterpiece. Well, what now? You can't! Wanna hear something? Yeah, sure. I've nowhere else to be. All right. If you don't like it, just toss a drink at me or something, okay? - I'll get the message. - I will, don't worry. Do you wanna join me? Hell, no. I'm the audience. It's very good. This has been a good time, huh? Well, we're not done yet, are we? I hope not. If you ever wanna get together, just... click your heels. That's how it works, right? You gotta at least eat some. I don't know. Oh! Those are too good. You're gonna have to, I don't know, tie my hands to the chair legs. Only then I'd probably lean forward and grab 'em with my mouth. Hey, I'm eating those. You wanna see if I can manage a whole hamburger? Mickey? Are we dating? I just wanna know so as I know how to look at you. So... I think we're just pals who might be something more sometime in the future. You gotta ask Mr. Mayer. I think it's just pals. I'm not kissing you if that's what you're after. Your loss. - Don't I know it. - And anyways, after a mouthful of onion rings? No, thanks! No hamburger. Mr. Mayer said very specifically you were not to eat the food. I'm honestly very hungry. Those'll take the edge off. No, I gotta sleep tonight. Halpert will give you something for that later. Down the hatch. Okay, boys, here we go. - ...get set up. - Let her at least take a bite. We can't have a Dorothy who puts on weight halfway through the picture. - His words, not mine. - Can you take another bite with your head to the side, Mr. Rooney? - Yeah. That's our shot! - That's great stuff. That's great, Judy! Okay. Right. Okay. So, that was Sid's lawyers on the phone. - Why? - He wants them Sunday through Friday during school time. - No. - He claims you're homeless. How's he even paying for a lawyer? He's not making money off me anymore. So, where are you staying? I love my children. I take care of them. Where'd you stay last night? With a friend. And is that somewhere maybe you could take the kids to stay? I don't have a home. I can't even get a manager. Step right up and take 10% of my debts. You know what I'm gonna say. London would offer you - a lot of money - No. See, they're crazy for you. It's because the English are insane. Look, start earning again. Then Sid's people will have nothing on you. Lorna does adore London. Honey... the courts won't let you take them out of the country. So, you're saying I have to leave my children if I wanna make enough money to be with my children? I know it's hard. But I think you have to take this seriously. I can't. Thank you. Oh, God. You'll miss Christmas. Well, you see, darling, the problem is that... I don't currently own a chimney for Santa to climb down, so I'm no good to you kids. But I'll be back for New Year's, okay? Joey. Joe. Darling, I have to fix things, okay, so I can see you every day, the whole of every day. I just need a little money to make that happen. Where would we live then? I'm going to find us a new home for the three of us, so don't you get too comfortable here. I'm coming straight back for you. I am. Or maybe... I could... just hide out in here... with Nibbles instead. Okay. Shh. Ooh, it's very spacious in here. I might just have a bathroom plumbed in. You wouldn't mind, would you, Joe? I'd love it. Well, maybe I'll stay put, hmm? Would you visit me once in a while? In Joey's wardrobe? Oh, sure. There's room for three. Well, come on in. Do you wanna... Do you guys wanna play tennis or something? There's a court over there. Aw. I do like it here. I would very much like to stay. Judy! Hello, darling. Hello. Hello, darling. Hello. - I love you. - I love you too, darling. - Welcome to the Picador. - Thank you very much. Thank you. - Hello. - Welcome, Miss Garland. Oh, thank you. Ah, there she is. - The fabulous Miss Judy Garland. - Oh. - Bernard Delfont. How are you? - How wonderful. I'm good. I just adore London, - my home away from home. - Marvelous. - Come with me. - Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. I'm Rosalyn Wilder. I'll be looking after you - while you're in London. - Wonderful. Oh, lovely. We have a schedule printed for you. How old are you? I'm... I'm 28. Oh, it is a little cold in here. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I'll have somebody look into that right away. Thank you. Everywhere else I go, it seems they just knock the place down and start over as soon as I leave. I come back the next year and I have no idea where I am. London just sort of slaps on another coat of paint. I suppose we're rather old-fashioned. Oh, no, I like it. I like it. It's comforting. Call me if you need anything. I'll leave my card for you on the table here. It's beside the schedule. - Hadn't forgotten the... - schedule. I... I really do appreciate it. - We'll see you tomorrow morning. - See you tomorrow. Thank you. Right, here we are. Here? - Really? - Mm-hmm. We do all our rehearsals here. The acoustic is wonderful. This way. ♪ So... So... Somewhere ♪ ♪ Over the rainbow ♪ Well, that sounds familiar. Judy, this is our band leader, Burt Rhodes. Burt, Judy. - It's... - Hello, Burt. ...an honor to be working with you, Ms. Garland. I've been an admirer for a long time. Well, I like this one. He can stay. The whole town is talking about you. Oh, well, let's not dwell on that. Oh, no. It's completely sold out. Hmm! Miss Garland? Do you need anything or should we dive in? You know, it's really damp in here. I don't think rehearsing is a good idea. Right. - Uh... - You understand, darling? Okay, well, how about we talk about the band positions? Okay. Well, I'm going to be here. And this, this is the mark-up for the stage. Hmm. Right. And where's the audience? Wrapped around you, all three sides. Mm-hmm. - And they're on one level? - Four. How many tiers was Carnegie Hall? Five. We can discuss the songs if you really want to. I have all your charts. Any changes you might like to make? No, everything the same. Is there anything to discuss, then? Sweetheart, that's up to you. I don't particularly need to discuss anything. Judy, I'm afraid the critics - will review opening night. - Sure. Of course. - It's tomorrow. - I'd like to rest. Hi. It's Judy. Are the kids there? Will you tell them that I called? And that I'll try them again at this time tomorrow? And I'd like them to be on the line next time I call, okay? - Good evening, Miss Garland. - And to you. Oh, do... Do you have the time? It's 3:00 in the morning, ma'am. - Oh. - Can I get you anything? I am having a little trouble sleeping. Some warm milk, perhaps? Sure. Thank you. I'll try anything once. I'll have them bring it up to you straightaway. Thank you. - Has the stage door called yet? - Not yet. She's late. Hello. Can we go to the Picador, please? Judy? Judy, it's Rosalyn. How are you? I don't feel too good. Do you know what time it is? I said I don't feel good. What kind of goddamn lock is that? If I lock a door, I like it to stay that way. That's completely understandable. Now, this is Vivian. She's going to take your temperature. Take a sip of this. Tongue out for me. Lips together for me, darling. What's the prognosis? No spots, no fever, throat's fine. Go for a nice red lippy. What do you think of this, Judy? Oh, it's very pretty. Put some silver dust on your cheekbones. You'll look incredible. Are you a nurse or what? Yeah, if you like. Take an arm of this, Vivian. You can finish that - on the way. - Yeah. Now, oopsy-daisy. - There we go. One leg in. - Oh, God. That's it. Shoes. - There we go. - Hey! You look absolutely incredible. All right! All right, all right We can't wait to show you off. I felt so terrible earlier. Well, you do work very hard. You're under a lot of pressure. Since I was two. Judy Garland, born in a trunk. That's what I say. Right. Now... Wait, wait. What are we... It's opening night, Judy. Oh, yes, of course. Well, here we are. Judy! Hello. Hello, darling. - Hello. Hello, darling. - Excuse me. Thank you. - I love you too, darling. - Yes, yes. Thank you. Let... Let us through, please. - Hello, Judy. - Are those for me? - These are for you. - Oh, they're beautiful. - You mean so much to us. - We wanted you to know. Gentlemen, sorry, but Judy is running extremely late now. Thank you, ladies. Clear the way. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's right up here, Judy. Okay, here we go, boys. What's the matter? - Ladies and gentlemen... - I can't. What? No, no, no. What do you mean, you can't? There's an audience out there waiting to hear you sing. My mouth's dry and it could fall apart. - No. Listen to me. - I can't. You'll be fine. Now, on you go. - We love you, Judy! - Oh, say! And I love you, too. In fact, I love this whole town. Though you will always be special. You know, the first time... I sang... on a stage, I was all of two years old. They say my papa had to come and drag me off after I started singing the same song for the fifth time. Oh. It seems we have a band here.

Oh. - A mess. - Here. Let me have a go at it. There. - Perfect. - Brand new. Right. Well, can I get you anything? No. No, thanks. A glass of water or... No, no. I'll get my bag and I'll meet you outside. Of course. Get up. I can't sleep at all anymore. Please, I can't sleep. Please. Please. That's not my department. But I can't remember the steps, and the others keep pushing me to the back, and everyone shouts at me when I have a hard time with it. Get up. - What's this? - Judy Garland turns 16. - But that's not for two months. - Gotta be today. Scheduling issues. Nobody splash her hair. So this is really... I mean, it's not really a party? In the middle of a shoot? You would have to be kidding. There is a cake. Don't eat it. Is it fake? Pretend to eat it. You know I get an hour for lunch? - It's in my contract. - What are you talking about? I get an hour. I wanna have it. I don't see why I shouldn't. Nobody takes it. Come on. Judy. Don't you dare. Who wants to have some real fun? Yeah! What do you have in mind? Is he propositioning me? Who wants to hear "The Trolley Song"?

It's a prime slot, so... Oh, marvelous. Thank you. - Well, good night. - Good night. Good night, Norman. Good night, Miss Garland. - Aw! Evening, fellas. - Bravo. - You were wonderful again. - Thank you, darling. - Would you mind? - Oh, of course. Coming to see you every night next week. You're just... I, um... What was it that I said earlier? - About Judy? - Yes, about Judy. - Of course about Judy. - Uh, it was about how you seem to bypass the ears and land here. - That was the gist of it. - Thank you. Um... Uh, do you... Do you wanna, um... get some dinner or... I mean, if you're not doing anything. - You mean with us? - I don't wanna impose. - No. Yes. I mean... - I mean, that would be beyond... - Where's gonna be open? - On a Tuesday after midnight... - If it's trouble, I don't... - No, no, no. No. - We'll find somewhere, won't we? - Of course. Great, okay, well... Lead on, my good gentlemen. - Your bag. - Thank you, dear. Oh! I thought they'd be open. Perhaps it was terrible dragging you - through the streets like this. - Oh, no, don't. I haven't had a chance to see any of the city. And, well, now I've seen all of it, so... Sweet. Would you like me to make you an omelet? Obviously, we'll try for something a little better than an omelet. We're just round the corner. You won't believe it, but it was twice with Mickey Rooney. You are outrageous. You all right - with the green plates? - Yes, please. - Great. - I like those. - Me too. - Mm. I think I messed this up. You can't really mess up an omelet. I put cream in it. - Why would you put cream in? - To make it more special. And instead you've simply made it not work. Yes, I'm aware of that. If it won't settle for being an omelet, just give it a shove, and we'll have scrambled eggs. - Would you mind? - For goodness' sake, has there ever been so much drama over half a dozen eggs? I mean, we invite you over for dinner, all we offer you are eggs, and now you're doing the cooking. I always do the cooking. No, I can't. I can't bear it. Come on. - I'm a very good cook. - I'm sure. Put that spoon down. - You don't trust me. - I do. Put that spoon down, would you? Please, for me. Put the spoon... Let's give you a drink. Come on. I'm always going to use cream from now on. It'll be fine. Let's get you a drink. Come on. You sit yourself down. Are you gonna come through or hide in there all night? I'm not sure that was even scrambled eggs. Well, we know some eggs went into the pan. - We witnessed that. - Mm-hmm. It was delicious. Whatever it was. Shh. It's sweet that you come to see me. Sometimes I spy the two of you out there. I feel like I have allies. Well, we missed you in '64, so... - You couldn't get tickets? - Not together, no. Stan was otherwise engaged. Six months for obscenity. In jail? They've changed the law since then. Turns out we didn't do anything wrong after all. They hound people in this world. Anybody who's different. They can't stand it. Well, to hell with them.

What are you doing here? I can't believe it. What a wonderful surprise. Oh! Oh. Well... - this is me. - Yeah, it's nice, it's nice. - When did you get here? - Just now. - Yeah? - Literally. I just walked off the plane. - I'm just passing through. - Where are you staying? I don't know. I don't know. I literally just showed up. I haven't thought about anything. Well, stay here. Yeah? I'm drowning in space. Yeah, no, I mean, that... That sounds great. Okay. I'll stay here, then. It's so good to see you again. You ever tried a crumpet? - Mm. - It's like a pancake that's had the living shit kicked out of it. You gonna eat something? No, no. No, I'm fine. Well, have some eggs. The tomatoes are pretty good. I'm fine. Come on, have a bite. What do you wanna do? I'm easy. Maybe, uh... get a drink - with your friends. - Sure. We could get the gang together. I'll make some calls. Yeah, it's okay. It's just okay? It's a little old-ladyish. I'm just saying. You got great legs. Show them off. Yeah? Yeah. Wow. Wish there was a little more of them. So, let's go shopping, baby. Hmm? - Get you dolled up. - I don't know. Oh, come on. A woman's gotta wear something. Or not, right? Look out. Don't kill America's sweetheart here. All right. Oh, boy, oh, boy. Oh, yeah, I have a great idea for a new shop. Oh? What's that? It's great to meet you guys. I've heard so much about you. How are you enjoying London, Mickey? It's one of the world's great cities, you know, it really is. And there's a lot of opportunities here, too. Like with The Beatles new record. You've heard it? It's good. It's very, very experimental. And it's still number one on the charts, you know? That tells me that there is an appetite out there. For The Beatles? Well, for great artists trying new things. Like, I don't know you, Burt. Judy says you're great. These are just new ideas, you know. But what if it's not Judy and Burt? What if it's... What if it's Judy and The Rolling Stones? What is that? I don't know. Maybe it's something, right? Are you going to ask them or should I? Maybe somebody should. That's all I'm saying for now. That's the most fascinating conjecture. - Thank you. - Don't you think? Oh, absolutely. Ha! All right, yeah, cool. Another round? - Yeah, great. - Great. You don't think I could do it. Well, I just... Well, I'm trying to take the idea in. Well, he thinks I could do it. Isn't that sweet? Judy, what you having? - Gin and tonic? - Yes. The studio portrayed you as the sort of typical American teenage girl next door. Is that how you remember things? Louis B. Mayer. Oh, MGM put out all these stories about how I ate pizza like any other girl. They didn't let me have any pizza at all. Every lunchtime for a year, they had me eating Louis B. Mayer's chicken soup till I was thin enough to play Dorothy. The truth is, those years left their mark, - though, isn't it? - Oh, sure. Hollywood's chicken population never recovered. Very good. But your childhood at the studio, it did lead to problems, didn't it? Well, what matters to me now is my children's happiness, that's all. Are they here with you in London? They have school. Well, they must miss their mother. Hopefully they're having an easier time of it than you had. Well, we all... Everybody has their troubles, and I've had mine. I've probably had everybody else's too. Has it affected your children, do you think? What? The fights over custody. Your children living away from you. I mean, if I'm this terrible mother they like to write about, well, you tell me how I end up with such incredible kids. But I wasn't suggesting... Well, no, everybody suggests things, like I'm not a real person, but I am, you understand? I'm only Judy Garland for an hour a night. The rest of the time, I'm part of a family. I just want what everybody wants. I seem to have a harder time getting it. I didn't mean to upset you. Thank you. Have you seen Judy? Gill, you haven't seen Judy, - have you? - No, I'm sorry. - Judy? - Miss Garland to the stage, please. Miss Garland. Judy, it's twelve o'clock. And? And there's a thousand people upstairs - waiting to hear you sing. - So bring 'em another drink. And have 'em bring me one, too. I know... - I know it's not easy. - Oh, you do, do you? I mean, the shows - have been a huge success. - So what? It doesn't change anything. What difference does it make? Look. I'll do all I can to help you resolve whatever's going on. But, please... for my sake, just... Just... Just do the show. You're a classy little number, aren't you? Just get up and sing! You wanna serve me up to them like I'm their goddamn dinner. Judy, I'm sorry, but that is not what I'm trying to do. - I'm trying to help you. - Don't Judy me. You're not my friend. You don't care about me. Listen, it's fine. It's fine. We'll just have Lonnie Donegan perform. Over my dead body! - If you don't want to do it... - It's my show. It's my name up there. No, Lonnie Donegan is a peach of a man, but he can go fuck himself if he thinks he's having my billing. - She's upset. - Yes, I gathered that. Evening, Lonnie. No! No time for that, Burt. We've got a show to, you know, put on. - You're late. - So what? It's a party. Where are you? Oh! What, do you have to be home for your mommy to put you to bed? Be a man, have another drink. Have one on me. He's gonna have one on me. - What you let her on stage for? - Wonderful to be here. There you go. Yeah. Is this... Is this Chicago? What is it? The set list says San Francisco. Chicago, San Francisco... What the hell town are we in anyway? Sing us a song. Is that you again? I thought you were gonna have a drink. You drank the bar dry. Oh! Why did you just spoil it for everyone? How am I supposed to do this up here with you harassing me like that down there? Why don't you come up here and you do the show? And I'll take the chair and do the fatuous backtalk, you goddamn fucking baboon! I want her changed and ready in five minutes. I'd like a moment with Judy. I had a swim. How was the water? Cold. That's because it's a prop. It's not meant to be enjoyed. I did 18 hours yesterday. I mean, I couldn't hardly remember my own name. Your name is Frances Gumm. You're a fat-ankled, snag-toothed rube from Grand Rapids. Your father was a faggot, and your mother only cares about what I think of you. Now, do you remember who you are, Judy? I'm sorry if I slowed things down a little. We like you loyal. You're the best friend. The girl next door. - You're faithful. - I'm sorry. You sing from the heart, Judy. You know where the heart is? It's there. Now, I want you to look me in the eye and tell me you remember we made a deal. I know I did. You made that choice. I was there. I heard you make it. I'm sorry. You wanna go swimming, you come over to my beach house. You can swim there all night. Now, say thank you. Thank you. Don't ever hold up a movie of mine. You know what? You need your own place. A club or something. Someplace... people are gonna come to anyway because it's a cool place. And if you sing, it's a goddamn perfect miracle of a night. And if you don't, it's no foul, it was a good time. People just wanna be around you. You have that. You know, I talk to people. You don't hear it. They all love you. I'm serious. You don't see it. People talk about what's next for you because maybe they could get in on it. Because you're a big deal. I... I have a perspective on this that I think you don't. I see how great you are. I don't see the problems. You'll get it perfect next time, all right? Sweetheart? You can't stay there forever. Sweetheart. I really feel just terrible about last night. I sincerely believed that I was coming down with something. And I took a syrup for the flu. And I was off with the fairies. And I just... I got so upset. And, Rosalyn, I wanna thank you for... For looking after me. Oh... If I'd have known you were unwell, I wouldn't have asked you to sing. And the press might've been more forgiving. But can you forgive me? It's forgotten. The question is... how are you feeling today? Well, as it happens, I feel terrific. We have a man I'd encourage you to see. He does vitamin injections. Whatever you'd like me to do. Right. Would you sing for me, - please? - Sing? Any scale will do. Good, and up. Right, well... it's not in a good way, is it? Have there been any surgeries? Tracheotomy. Two years ago. Tried to kill myself. That won't have helped your voice. Hmm. Hepatitis as well. Look, do you take anything for depression? Four husbands. Didn't work. I'd say you're underweight. Well, you're flirting with me now. Mr. Delfont asked me to give you something, so I'm going to give you a vitamin injection and some anti-inflammatories for your vocal cords. What you really need is rest. Mm! At home, with my children. - Precisely. With your feet up. - Mm-hmm. Good. Ooh! Do you know, I, uh... I had an absolute thing for Dorothy Gale. My goodness. A lot of boys liked her pigtails. Yeah. For me, it was... It was more about how she took care of her dog. You might be the most English man I've ever met. Judy... you need to take better care of yourself. You understand? - Do you understand? - Mm. So there's a guy I mentioned. Mm-hmm. Desperate to do a deal with you. - Mm-hmm. - Okay. His thing is a chain of maybe 500 movie theaters, okay? Each one is called a Judy Garland Picture House. Every one? All you gotta do for each one is you open it, and you get 10% of sales. - Ten percent? - Ten percent. He tried to make it seven, but I pushed him up. And I don't have to do anything else? No touring, nothing. You get to pay off your debts, you buy that house, and you see your kids every single day. - Mickey. - You're free. Isn't that the greatest thing you ever heard? Yes, it's the greatest thing. Oh, darling. - Good news, right? - Yes. Yeah, just had to tell you that. This isn't so bad, is it? I mean, I know it's not family, but... You're family. That's how I feel. Yeah? I have an incredible feeling about you, Mickey. Look what you're doing. Look how you take care of me. I mean, it's completely crazy, - but... - But it's very real. Yeah, I know. I know. Are you happy? Yeah... I am. You and me. You and me. I want us to get married. I feel like any moment we're not married is wasted. I mean, do you remember Scotty Beckett? He played my kid brother in Listen, Darling in '37 or '38. He was the sweetest kid. And last year, just like that, he's dead from something or other. That and... I'm happy with you. And shouldn't we grab hold of that? I... I'm here, aren't I? That's a hell of an answer. Sweetheart, I already said I love you nine times today. Well, maybe I need ten, or 12, once an hour, like a cuckoo clock. Cuckoo! I love you! Well? Mm. To the happy couple. - Cheers. - Cheers. It's our present to you, so you just trust me, okay? Judy, Judy, you go to the front. It's a surprise. It's a surprise. Burt, are you ready? I think the bloody matches are damp. Matches? I'm a little terrified.

Well, maybe you'll make it as a singer after all. - I think I at least have a shot. - Hmm. Who's looking after the kids? They're being looked after. By whom? A maid? Maybe we, uh... Maybe it's time we... put all the lawyers aside. Can't afford them either, huh? You and I need to work out what's best for the kids. They need to know... how their general situation's gonna be. - I'm coming back for them. - The kids need a home. - I can give them that. - I know what kids need. - They need their mother. - They also need school, and friends they can rely on seeing. No. - Come on. - No, Sid. - Judy. - No. No! I'm working harder than you would ever believe. - Are you? - And right now, my husband is making a deal for me - that means I can start over. - You're not listening. I have someone I can rely on now. Someone who's helping me make money instead of losing it at the track. - Can we not... - I'm going to get a place. And they're going to live with me. I don't want them on stage with me, I don't want them in this phony business, and I don't want them anywhere near the bastards who run it. But you have to let me be with them, Sid. I'm a good mother. I know you try. That's a sneaky little jab in the guts. I know what a bad mother is. I lived with one. They love you. They do. They miss you, and they wanna see you. And they also wanna stay put. That's what they want. - That's the truth. - Stay put? - That's what they told me. - Stay put with you. - That's what they told me. - I see. And I'm just supposed to take your word for it. - What, you think I'm an idiot? - Judy. You think I'm an idiot? Do you think I'd take your word for anything, you lousy son of a bitch? That my children would wanna live anywhere that I'm not? - Keep it down. - It's not true! - Keep your voice down. - It's not true! I knew you were low, but, Jesus, Sid. No. - Sit down. - No. Mickey? Hey. Thank God you're back. Never again. Do you hear me? You can't leave me like that. - All right - Did you miss me? - Of course. - Yeah? - I got you something. - You did? - No. - The shop didn't carry wrapping. I love it. I love it. Oh, darling, thank you. Thank you. What time is it? - Uh... - They'll be waiting for me. Oh, the day I've had. - What happened? - I just... I need a drink. - Would you mind? - Of course. How was New York? How'd it go? You know, we need to send some of the advance money to my lawyer straight away. I wanna reopen custody. And I feel like, you know, I should... at least pay him something, you know? Um... sweetheart? Yeah? Yeah? What's wrong? It didn't, uh... turn out like I wanted. What do you mean? The deal. It... It didn't work out. - I don't understand. - Yeah. You have to keep singing for a while, I think. You have more dates at Talk of The Town. No, I can't keep touring. I have to go home to my kids. I have to go home. You promised. - I tried my best, Judy, okay? - No, you promised. Look, I tried to make something happen, but they had other ideas, all right? - Why? - Why? - I don't know. - Yeah, why? Why, Mickey? Showing up late, cursing at the audience. Their wives read about that in the papers. They got cold feet. So I messed it up? That's their opinion about it. If you wanna know, yeah. And what's your opinion, Mickey? Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I don't think it's anybody's fault. I think maybe I could've asked more questions upfront. Oh, my God. Maybe you could have laid off the stuff a little bit. Oh, so you do think it's my fault? - I didn't say that. - You do. - You think it's my fault. - Of course it's your fault! So, uh... what is it... What is that you do, anyway, Mickey? What does that mean? You're just like all the other ones. You sit on the sidelines and you watch the show, and you think that's making things happen. You think that's working. What have you ever done that would make anybody wanna listen to you? I shouldn't have come back here. You shouldn't have come in the first place. I'm not gonna be here - when you get back. - I don't care! Judy! Miss Garland to the stage, please. Miss Garland to the stage. Miss Garland to the stage, please. Miss Garland. You're late, Miss Garland. Miss Garland, you should be on stage, please. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. Hey, there's a lady up here. London, I love you. It's true, it's true. - Of all the towns I've loved... - Get off the... ...I love London best. ♪ San Francisco ♪ ♪ Open your Golden Gate ♪ ♪ You'll let nobody wait Outside your door ♪ ♪ San Francisco... ♪ I do have a beautiful show for you. I have... I have a beautiful show for you. I have a beautiful show for you tonight. I always have a beautiful show - for you. - Come on! You know I do. I always have a beautiful show for you. Always! Hey! It's Mama. Hang... Hang on. Mama? Mama, are you there? Mama? Hello, sweetheart. How are you? - I'm okay. - Yeah? And... And... And how's school? I drew a really amazing picture today, actually. You did? Oh, it's just... There's a tree, and me and you are at the bottom. That's wonderful, darling. I'm... I'm... I'm proud of you. Yeah, it was cool. Um... Listen, um... I spoke with your papa. And... And he... He feels that you and Joey have a right to know where you're going to be living for the next few years. And... I agree. And... I think... I think that if... If you're happy where you are, if that's working out, that maybe you'd like to know that it's okay to say that. How does that sound? That sounds good, Mama. Is that what you and Joe want? Yeah. I guess it's nice not to move so much. Would you be okay? Oh, sure. I'll be great. I love you, okay? I hope you know that. Yeah. Okay, okay. Bye, darling. Bye, Mama. Well, that's all I could find in your dressing room. Thank you. Well, if Delfont's going to sue me for everything I own, you might wanna hold onto those... 'cause that's it. Are you angry with me? Not really. Just... - You are. - No, I just... I wish... I wish things had been different. You did a very good job trying to... Nobody's blaming you? No. Everyone knows you're impossible. Oh, good. So I've a little surprise for you, if you can bear it. Oh, no kidding. - It's the least we could do. - Aw! We can't send you off without a cake. Oh, it's so pretty. No, no. Maybe one of you should do it. Every time I cut a cake, I find I've married some jerk. I'll do it. Thank you. Thank you. It looks delicious. - Mm. - Mm. That's good. That's really good. I think maybe I was just hungry. Here's to you. So, what's next? Well, there'll be something. Or maybe I'll just wait tables. I might come with you. Maybe we'd meet some nice fellows who tip heavily. Half the world wanna take you out. Oh, no. The first man I ever asked out was Mickey Rooney. - Hmm. - Hmm. I mean, you look at him now and he's this little bowling ball kind of guy. But, uh... Oh, I was mad about him. And he turned me down flat. Hmm. At least, that's how I remember it. Are you going to be all right? Sure. It's snowing outside, which I like. I have three beautiful children. I have a lot to be grateful for. Could I come back with you? You want to see the show? I still believe in it, you know? The love you find with an audience. On a good night. And I hear Lonnie's one hell of a performer. Are you sure? Sorry, what do you mean, Lonnie Donegan? We bought tickets to see Judy Garland. - Yes. - There's nothing I can do. These cost an arm and a leg. You call the manager now! - A refund. Just get us a refund. - Call him now! Well, I'll be out front if you need me. Enjoy it. - Thank you. - No. Come on, come on. Let's get out of here. We're done. You wanna get some dinner? You know, uh... maybe we could... I mean, listen to that. Come on, Judes. Really, we're done. Maybe some other time. - Hello. - Hi, Lonnie. I didn't think I'd see you here. Oh, well, I'm just here to watch the show. Go, go and be wonderful. Thank you. That's very kind of you. Lonnie. Yeah? Do you think... Could I give them just one song? I... I don't think that I'll be here again, and I didn't do so well at my last show. Ladies and gentlemen, please give a very warm welcome to tonight's Talk of The Town headline attraction, Mr. Lonnie Donegan. Well, I suppose they have bought their tickets hoping to see you. Go on.
