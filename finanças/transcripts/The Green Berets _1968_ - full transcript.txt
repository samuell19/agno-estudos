LEFT, FACE! PARADE, REST! [ SPEAKING GERMAN ] I AM THE DETACHMENT COMMANDER. I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT OF THIS DETACHMENT. THESE COMPACT, HIGHLY TRAINED DETACHMENTS MAY BE EMPLOYED IN EMERGENCY AREAS OF THE WORLD TO ASSIST FRIENDLY GOVERNMENTS IN COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS. THEY MAY ALSO BE UTILIZED IN THE UNCONVENTIONAL WARFARE ROLE. THROUGHOUT TRAINING, INDIVIDUAL SURVIVAL UNDER VARYING CONDITIONS IS STRESSED. I SPEAK NORWEGIAN AND GERMAN. [ SPEAKING GERMAN ] I AM THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER. MY DUTIES INCLUDE SUPERVISION OF ALL ADMINISTRATIVE AND LOGISTICAL MATTERS. IN THE EVENT THE DETACHMENT WERE TO BE SPLIT INTO TWO TEAMS, I WOULD COMMAND ONE OF THESE. I SPEAK GERMAN AND SPANISH. THAT JUST ABOUT COVERS THE CENTRAL AREA, COLONEL. AS YOU KNOW, THE "C" DETACHMENT COMMANDER IN THAT AREA IS COLONEL FRANKS. IN THE SOUTHERN AREA, THERE HAS BEEN APPROXIMATELY A 30% INCREASE IN OUR OPERATIONAL DETACHMENTS OVER THE PAST YEAR. SIR, SINCE YOU SERVED AS A "C" DETACHMENT COMMANDER, I WON'T ELABORATE ON THE SOUTHERN CORPS, COLONEL KIRBY. THANK YOU. IN SUMMATION, THE BULK OF OUR PROBLEMS SEEM TO BE IN THE NORTHERNMOST AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. THIS CONCLUDES OUR BRIEFING. ANY QUESTIONS? I THINK NOT, COLONEL. THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN, THAT WILL BE ALL. UH, YOU STAY BEHIND. OH, UH...CAPTAIN? YES, SIR. YOU'LL LEAVE THE JEEP FOR ME? YES, SIR. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, MIKE, WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? SOMETHING'S BOTHERING YOU. WHAT IS IT? WHEN DO YOU EXPECT ME TO TAKE OVER, SIR? IMMEDIATELY. WHY? WHEN I GET OVER THERE, I'M GOING TO BE DESK-BOUND. THEY'RE GOING TO SNOW ME UNDER WITH PAPERWORK. I'D LIKE TO GET ORIENTED TO THE CRITICAL AREA. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THOSE FORWARD CAMPS. HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU NEED? WELL, I'LL NEED THREE WEEKS FOR -- YOU GOT IT. AND WHEN YOU SEE OLD CACTUS THOMAS -- HE'S OVER THERE NOW -- GIVE HIM MY REGARDS. YES, SIR. I'LL SEE YOU, MIKE. THANK YOU, SIR. [ DOOR CLOSES ] THANK YOU, SIR. * IF MY MAIN DON'T OPEN WIDE * * I GOT ANOTHER ONE BY MY SIDE * * I GOT ANOTHER ONE BY MY SIDE * [ CHANTING CONTINUES ] HELLO, BILL. MORNING, MIKE. UP KINDA EARLY, AREN'T YOU? NOT FOR AIRBORNE. MacDANIAL: MORNING, COLONEL. HEY, MAC. THIS YOURS? YES, SIR. THESE YOURS? WHY DON'T YOU ASK 'EM? WHO ARE YA? Together: AIRBORNE! HOW FAR? Together: ALL THE WAY! I'LL GET PART OF THEM. OH, YOU ALWAYS DO, MIKE. [ CHANTING CONTINUES ] I AM THE COMBAT ENGINEER SPECIALIST. I HAVE THE SAME BASIC KNOWLEDGE AS THE ENGINEER SERGEANT. I'M CROSS-TRAINED AS A MEDIC AND WEAPONS. I SPEAK FRENCH AND VIETNAMESE. [ SPEAKING DANISH ] I'M THE RADIO OPERATOR SUPERVISOR. MY DUTY INCLUDES MAINTAINING A SECURE COMMUNICATIONS LINK WITH MY NEXT HIGHER DETACHMENT, ORGANIZING AND SUPERVISING COMMUNICATIONS TRAINING FOR NATIVE MILITARY PERSONNEL. I'M CROSS-TRAINED IN INTELLIGENCE AND WEAPONS. I SPEAK DANISH AND HAVE A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF NORWEGIAN AND ENGLISH. Soldier: DETACHMENT, ATTENTION! RIGHT FACE! FORWARD, MARCH! MULDOON, TAKE OVER! YES, SIR! I'M MASTER SERGEANT MULDOON, AND THIS IS SERGEANT McGEE. BETWEEN US, WE'VE HAD THREE TOURS OF DUTY IN SOUTH VIETNAM, WHICH MAKES US EXPERTS. SO WE'VE BEEN ORDERED TO VOLUNTEER TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR YOU HERE TODAY. I'M HUME PARKINSON. I HAPPEN TO BE A NEWSPAPERMAN. SINCE YOU'VE BEEN IN VIETNAM, PERHAPS YOU CAN ANSWER A QUESTION MANY OF OUR SUBSCRIBERS ASK. Sgt. Muldoon: WE'LL TRY. WHY IS THE UNITED STATES WAGING THIS RUTHLESS WAR? FOREIGN POLICY DECISIONS ARE NOT MADE BY THE MILITARY. A SOLDIER GOES WHERE HE'S TOLD TO GO, AND FIGHTS WHOMEVER HE'S TOLD TO FIGHT. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT, SERGEANT McGEE, THAT THE GREEN BERET IS JUST A MILITARY ROBOT WITH NO PERSONAL FEELINGS? CAN I HAVE YOUR NAME, SIR? GEORGE BECKWORTH, CHRONICLE HERALD. THANK YOU, SIR. SYBIL SUTTON, WASHINGTON SENTINEL. WOULD YOU PLEASE ANSWER THAT QUESTION, SERGEANT McGEE? DO THEY PRESS A BUTTON? DO YOU MEN DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD TO DO WITHOUT ANY PERSONAL FEELINGS OR OPINIONS? WE HAVE FEELINGS, MISS SUTTON, AND OPINIONS. IT'S PRETTY HARD NOT TO FORM THEM OUT THERE. EVERYONE KNOWS THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE ARE FIGHTING AND DYING FOR THEIR CAUSE. AS SOLDIERS, MISS SUTTON, WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE KILLING OF THE MILITARY, BUT THE EXTERMINATION OF THE CIVILIAN LEADERSHIP, THE INTENTIONAL MURDER AND TORTURE OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN -- YES, HORRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN IN WAR, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY THEY NEED US OR EVEN WANT US. I'LL TRY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR YOU. LET ME PUT IT IN TERMS WE ALL CAN UNDERSTAND. IF THIS SAME THING HAPPENED HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, EVERY MAYOR IN EVERY CITY WOULD BE MURDERED. EVERY TEACHER THAT YOU'D EVER KNOWN WOULD BE TORTURED AND KILLED. EVERY PROFESSOR YOU EVER HEARD OF, EVERY GOVERNOR, EVERY SENATOR, EVERY MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THEIR COMBINED FAMILIES, ALL WOULD BE TORTURED AND KILLED, AND A LIKE NUMBER, KIDNAPPED. BUT IN SPITE OF THIS, THERE'S ALWAYS SOME LITTLE FELLA OUT THERE WILLING TO STAND UP AND TAKE THE PLACE OF THOSE WHO'VE BEEN DECIMATED. THEY NEED US, MISS SUTTON, AND THEY WANT US. SERGEANT, I'M GLADYS COOPER, A HOUSEWIFE. IT'S STRANGE THAT WE'VE NEVER READ OF THIS IN THE NEWSPAPERS. WELL...THAT'S NEWSPAPERS FOR YOU, MA'AM. YOU COULD FILL VOLUMES WITH WHAT YOU DON'T READ IN 'EM. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S SOMETIMES VERY TRUE, SERGEANT. HOW DO YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE FIGHTING FOR THIS PRESENT GOVERNMENT? THEY'VE HAD NO FREE ELECTIONS, THEY HAVE NO CONSTITUTION. SIX MONTHS AGO, A COMMITTEE WAS APPOINTED TO FORM A CONSTITUTION, STILL NO CONSTITUTION. THE SCHOOL I WENT TO, MR. BECKWORTH, TAUGHT US THAT THE 13 COLONIES WITH PROPER AND EDUCATED LEADERSHIP, ALL WITH THE SAME GOAL IN MIND, AFTER THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR, TOOK FROM 1776 TO 1787, 11 YEARS OF PEACEFUL EFFORT, BEFORE THEY CAME UP WITH A PAPER THAT ALL 13 COLONIES WOULD SIGN -- OUR PRESENT CONSTITUTION. THAT'S VERY GOOD, SERGEANT. BUT THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE THIS IS SIMPLY A WAR BETWEEN THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE. IT'S THEIR WAR. LET'S LET THEM HANDLE IT. LET THEM HANDLE IT, MR. BECKWORTH? CAPTURED WEAPONRY. FROM RED CHINA. CHAI-COM K-50. CHINESE COMMUNISTS. SKS SOVIET-MADE CARBINE. RUSSIAN COMMUNISTS. AMMUNITION -- CZECHOSLOVAKIAN-MADE. CZECH COMMUNISTS. NO SIR, MR. BECKWORTH, IT DOESN'T TAKE A LEAD WEIGHT TO FALL ON ME, OR A HIT FROM ONE OF THOSE WEAPONS TO RECOGNIZE WHAT'S INVOLVED HERE IS COMMUNIST DOMINATION OF THE WORLD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PARDON US FOR GIVING A LITTLE MORE THAN A YES OR NO ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTIONS. ARE THERE ANY MORE? WELL, SECTION "C" TAKE THE BLUE TRAIL, AND SECTIONS "A" AND "B", THE RED TRAIL FOR FURTHER ORIENTATION ON THE CAPABILITIES OF THE GREEN BERET. [ APPLAUSE ] KOWALSKI, BREAK OUT THE GEAR. OKAY, SARGE. GIVE ME A HAND, DOC. COLONEL. YES? YOUR BRAINWASHED SERGEANT DIDN'T SELL ME. DIDN'T SELL YOU WHAT? DIDN'T SELL ME ON THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO SOUTHEAST ASIA? NO, I HAVEN'T. UH-HUH. SIR, A SERGEANT PROVO REQUESTS PERMISSION TO SPEAK WITH YOU. PROVO? HEAVY WEAPONS SPECIALIST. I'LL SEE HIM. YES, SIR. SIR, SERGEANT PROVO REQUESTS PERMISSION TO SPEAK TO THE COLONEL. AT EASE. I APPRECIATE YOUR SEEING ME, SIR. I KNOW HOW BUSY YOU ARE. WELL? I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE HANDPICKING TWO "A" TEAMS FOR VIETNAM. IS THAT TRUE, SIR? WE MIGHT BE, AND WE MIGHT NOT. I'M INCLINED TO THINK IT MIGHT BE, SIR, AND SINCE I HAVEN'T BEEN PICKED, I'M VOLUNTEERING. YOU'RE A HEAVY WEAPONS SPECIALIST. NOT IF I CAN FIND A LIGHT ONE, SIR. WHY ARE YOU VOLUNTEERING, SERGEANT? 'CAUSE I'M A SOLDIER, SIR, AND THAT'S WHERE THE ACTION IS. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW. YES, SIR. THANK YOU, SIR. SERGEANT McGEE. PULL THAT MAN'S RECORD. I DID. HE'S A GOOD MAN, SIR. THANKS, DOC. YES, SIR. THERE HE IS, RIGHT ON TIME. YEAH, QUITE A CHARACTER -- A TOUR IN KOREA, A YEAR IN VIETNAM. HE SPEAKS THREE LANGUAGES. BUT ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS SOLDIER? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I CHECKED HIS JUMP RECORD, AND EVERY TIME HE GOES UP, THE JUMP MASTER HAS TO PUSH HIM OUT. THAT'S WHY I WANT HIM. HE WON'T QUIT. [ WHISTLE ] Col. Kirby: HOLD IT, SOLDIER. Man: TRAVELING. ONE MORE LIKE THAT, I'LL CALL A TECHNICAL. NICE DAY. UH, YES, SIR. KINDA OUT OF YOUR TERRITORY, AREN'T YOU? YES, SIR. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN OUR AREA? [ WHISTLE ] UH...WATCHING A BASKETBALL GAME, SIR. HMM. WHAT WERE YOU DOING HERE YESTERDAY? AND THE DAY BEFORE AND THE DAY BEFORE THAT? YOU SPEND SO MUCH TIME AROUND HERE, YOU'D THINK YOU WANTED TO JOIN OUR OUTFIT. UH...NO, I DON'T THINK I'D CARE TO JOIN THE FIFTH GROUP, SIR, NO. WELL, I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT, SOLDIER. MULDOON... YES, SIR? CARRY ON. SAY, MIKE, WHAT'S THAT? FELLA I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT. OHHH. PULL! [ GUNSHOT ] HELLO, SOLDIER. SO YOU DECIDED TO VOLUNTEER? MY PLEASURE, SIR. GOOD. PULL! NICE SHOOTING, SIR. THAT'S NORMAL. WHY WAS IT YOUR OUTFIT ALWAYS SENT YOU WHEN THEY NEEDED SOMETHING? OH, I GUESS I'M JUST GOOD AT IT, SIR. BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH. YOU GOT CAUGHT. YOUR MEN DID CATCH ME. ONE TIME OUT OF A HUNDRED. YOU BETTER HOPE THAT YOUR LUCK HOLDS OUT, BECAUSE YOUR FIRST ASSIGNMENT IS TO GO BACK TO THAT OLD OUTFIT OF YOURS, AND BRING BACK EVERYTHING YOU TOOK FROM US. YOU UNDERSTAND ME, SERGEANT? YES, SIR. SEE TO IT. YES, SIR! CARRY ON. Sgt. Muldoon: ABOUT FACE! FORWARD, MARCH! "SERGEANT"? THAT'S WHAT THE MAN SAID. "SERGEANT." SERGEANT. Sgt. Muldoon: EVERYBODY HIT THE DECK! UP AND AT 'EM. HEY, RISE AND SHINE! UP AND AT 'EM! HEY... RISE AND SHINE! LET'S GO. GET THE LEAD OUT. EVERYBODY ON YOUR FEET! LET'S GO! HEY-HEY! COME ON, SOLDIER, OUT OF THE SACK. EVERYBODY UP. IT'S 3:30. LET'S GO, LET'S GO! HEY, HEY! Soldier: WHAT'S UP? Soldier: WHO KNOWS? Sgt. Muldoon: ON YOUR FEET, SOLDIER, ON YOUR FEET. OW! HOLY TOLEDO, IT'S ONLY 3:30! 3:30? IS THAT RIGHT, SARGE? THAT'S RIGHT, SOLDIER BOY. THAT'S RIGHT. WE BETTER GET SOME SLEEP. WE GOT A HELL OF A LOT OF WORK TO DO TOMORROW. ON YOUR FEET, SOLDIER, ON YOUR FEET. WHAT KIND OF A CHICKEN -- YOU GOT 10 MINUTES TO PACK. HOW CAN I PACK EVERYTHING IN 10 MINUTES? IT TAKES ME LONGER THAN THAT TO GET MY HEART STARTED. WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? I'M PACKING. YOU PACK WHAT UNCLE SAM ISSUED, AND THAT'S ALL. YOU GOT NINE MINUTES. WHY THE COUNTDOWN? YOU GOT EIGHT. EIGHT. HEY, WHERE ARE WE GOING? YOU'LL GET THE WORD. Sgt. Muldoon: ON THE WAY OUT, EVERYBODY GRAB HIS GEAR. WELCOME TO DA NANG! HIYA, MIKE. GOOD TO SEE YA, FRANK. ME, TOO. UH, CAPTAIN MacDANIAL. HOW ARE YOU? I GOT THE JEEP RIGHT OVER HERE. WILL YOU SEE THE MEN GET ALL THEIR GEAR? YES, SIR. HERE WE GO. HOP IN. YOU KNOW, I BEEN RIDING ON THAT PLANE FOR HOURS. WOULD YOU RATHER WALK? I SURE WOULD. GOOD. LET'S STRETCH OUR LEGS THEN. REYNOLDS, MEET US OVER AT COLONEL CAI'S OFFICE, AND WATCH THAT WEAPON. YES, SIR. I'M SURE GLAD IT'S YOU RELIEVING ME, MIKE. DON'T HURRY ME. I GOT THREE WEEKS, YOU KNOW. I KNOW. THAT WAS A GREAT IDEA. HOW'S YOUR BACK? IT'S COMIN' ALONG SLOW BUT SURE. I'LL BE GLAD WHEN I CAN MOVE AROUND, BURN OFF SOME OF THIS. THIS TRUCK FOR US? YES, SIR. THAT'S SERVICE. OKAY. GRAB YOUR GEAR. HEY! "ARTHUR E. FULLER." I KNEW THAT GUY. NAMED THE FIELD AFTER HIM. HE WON THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE CROSS. POSTHUMOUSLY. BETTER GRAB YOUR GEAR. YEAH. I SUPPOSE YOU'LL TAKE THE LONG WAY BACK HOME, GO THROUGH HONG KONG, PICK UP A LITTLE YARDAGE AND SOME SCREENS. NO, I DON'T THINK SO. MY WIFE TOLD ME NOT TO BRING ANYTHING HOME SHE COULDN'T EITHER COOK OR PLAY WITH. WHAT'S MY OPPOSITE NUMBER LIKE? HIS NAME'S COLONEL CAI. HE'S A GOOD MAN -- RESOURCEFUL, INTELLIGENT, AND GOT A LOT OF INITIATIVE. OUTSTANDING? OUTSTANDING. CHUNG SEE BADO, GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU, SIR. GLAD YOU'RE IN THE OUTFIT. [ ORDERS SHOUTED IN VIETNAMESE ] THAT'S A SMART-LOOKING HONOR GUARD. I RECOGNIZE MOST OF THEM. EVEN ONES YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU. HOW COME? THEY GOT THE WORD. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON. COLONEL CAI, THIS IS COLONEL KIRBY. I'M HAPPY TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE, COLONEL KIRBY. THANK YOU. SIT DOWN. I HAVE HEARD MUCH ABOUT YOU FROM COLONEL MORGAN AND OTHERS. IF ONLY HALF OF WHAT I'VE HEARD IS TRUE, THEN I AM POSITIVE WE WILL WORK WELL TOGETHER. WE BUILD MANY CAMPS, CLOBBER MANY VC. AFFIRMATIVE? AFFIRMATIVE. I LIKE THE WAY YOU TALK. LET ME GET TO THE POINT. WE HAVE TWO NEW CAMPS, HERE AND HERE. THIS ONE IS ALL RIGHT, EVERYTHING IS STRIKE, A FULL COMPLEMENT OF MONTAGNARDS, AND, OF COURSE, SPECIAL FORCES. AND THE OTHER ONE? CAMP A-107, CODE NAME TWO-NINER SAVOY. THIS CAMP WE BUILD IN THE HEART OF VC COUNTRY. ONE DAY IS NOTHING, NEXT DAY WE ARE THERE. BIG SURPRISE FOR VC. UNFORTUNATELY, MIKE, "A" CAMP, 107's ONLY ABOUT HALF FINISHED. THE VIET CONG HIT IT WITH MORTAR FIRE THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK. THE VILLAGERS TELL US THE VC ARE MAKING A BIG BUILDUP JUST ACROSS THE BORDER. WE HAVE OUR FINGERS CROSSED THAT THE WEATHER DOES NOT KEEP US FROM HAVING AIR SUPPORT. WITHOUT IT, CHARLIE CAN OVERRUN THE CAMP WITH NO SWEAT. THE "A" TEAM'S TOUR OF DUTY WILL BE UP IN 10 DAYS. THAT PUTS THAT CAMP BETWEEN THE ROCK AND THE HARD PLACE UNTIL IT'S COMPLETED. I BROUGHT TWO "A" DETACHMENTS WITH ME. I COULD LEAVE ONE HERE TO FORM A MIKE FORCE AND TAKE THE OTHER UP FOR REPLACEMENTS, IF IT SUITS YOU. I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA. WELL, I HAVE TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO THE GENERAL AT 1500. NICE TO HAVE MET YOU. LIKEWISE. SEE YOU LATER, COLONEL. [ VIETNAMESE MUSIC PLAYS ] HEY, PROVO. SORRY, I DIDN'T SEE YOU COME OUT. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. EVERYBODY LIKES TO LOOK AT PRETTY GIRLS. NO, SIR, I WASN'T LOOKING AT THEM. I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE SIGN OVER THERE, "IN HONOR OF WILLIAM J. WALLACE." YOU KNOW, I NOTICED ALL THE BUILDINGS AND STREETS GOT THE NAMES OF HEROES ON THEM, DEAD HEROES. AND IT KINDA SETS A MAN TO THINKING. THAT IT DOES. AND I ALSO THINK WE BETTER GET MOVING. YES, SIR. YOU ALL RIGHT, SERGEANT? I'M STILL THINKING ABOUT THEM NAMEPLATES, SIR, YOU KNOW, THE ONES ABOUT SOLDIERS KILLED IN ACTION? WHAT WORRIES ME IS MY NAME JUST DON'T FIT ANY OF OUR BUILDINGS OR STREETS. YOU GOT A REAL WORRY THERE. MUST BE TOUGH HAVING TO WALK AROUND WITH A PROBLEM LIKE THAT. "PROVO'S BARRACKS," "PROVO'S COMMISSARY" -- YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN? NO. WELL, IT JUST DON'T SING. IF YOU THINK OF SOMETHING THAT DOES SING, YOU LET US KNOW, 'CAUSE WE'D WANT YOU TO HAVE THE BEST. WELL, THANK YOU, SIR, I APPRECIATE THAT. COLONEL? COLONEL. COLONEL! REMEMBER ME? GEORGE... BECKWORTH. THIS IS COLONEL MORGAN. HOW ARE YOU? HELLO, COLONEL. I TOOK YOUR SUGGESTION. I CAME TO SEE FOR MYSELF. GOOD FOR YOU. TOLD ME I COULD GO ALONG, BUT IT'D BE UP TO YOU. WHAT DO YOU THINK, COLONEL? PRETTY HAIRY OPERATION, MIKE. I DON'T THINK THIS AREA'S READY FOR WRITERS. HATE TO GET ONE GREASED. IS THAT THE REAL REASON? COME AGAIN? MY PAPER DOESN'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN VIETNAM. AFRAID I'LL SEE SOMETHING THAT MIGHT SUBSTANTIATE THAT BELIEF? BE MY GUEST. COLONEL. FRANK. GOOD LUCK, MIKE. WITH JOYOUS MEMORIES, WE LEAVE THE MYSTICAL CITY OF DA NANG. WHAT GAY ADVENTURE LIES AHEAD? BROTHER, THIS TRIP IS GOING TO MAKE LSD FEEL LIKE ASPIRIN. MR. BECKWORTH? YOU GOING TO WRITE ABOUT US? THAT'S RIGHT. Sgt. McGee: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY? I DON'T KNOW YET. MAN, OH MAN! LOOK AT ALL THEM TREES DOWN THERE. MY DOG COULD GO CRAZY. WE HAVE "A" TEAMS OUT ALONG THE CAMBODIAN AND LAOTIAN BORDERS. THEY EACH BUILT THEIR OWN CAMP. WE'RE HEADED FOR ONE OF THOSE NOW, CAMP A-107. THERE'S OUR DESTINATION. COLONEL. CAPTAIN. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS. YOU KNOW LIEUTENANT SACHS. THIS IS CAPTAIN MacDANIAL, YOUR REPLACEMENT. THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. SERGEANT KENNY, PICK UP THE EXTRA GEAR AND THE MAIL. IF YOU GENTLEMEN WILL FOLLOW ME, WE'LL GET INSIDE. YOU GOT ABOUT 150-FOOT KILLING AREA HERE, CAPTAIN. YES, SIR. CAPTAIN MacDANIAL, THE FIRST THING I'D DO WOULD BE TO CUT THAT BACK ANOTHER 300 FEET. WE'VE BEEN WANTING TO DO THE SAME THING, SIR, BUT WE'VE BEEN SHORT OF HELP. YEAH, WE TRIED TO GET SOME ENGINEERS. THEY'RE ALL BUSY. BUT I REQUESTED SOME SEABEES. IF THAT DETACHMENT EVER GETS HERE, PUT 'EM ON THAT FIRST THING. YES, SIR. Soldier: MAIL CALL! [ HONK HONK HONK ] MAIL CALL! MAIL CALL! "DODGE CITY"? YEAH. YOU CAN BUY IT CHEAP. THOSE WHAT THEY CALL PUNJI STAKES? YEP. A LITTLE TRICK WE LEARNED FROM CHARLIE. BUT WE DON'T DIP 'EM IN THE SAME STUFF HE DOES. IT WOULD INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT CONCERTINA WITH A LITTLE MORE TANGLEFOOT. YES, SIR. THOSE CLAYMORES ARE GREAT. GOT ANY MORE OF 'EM? YES, SIR. I'D DOUBLE THE NUMBER ON THE PERIMETER. WE'LL GET RIGHT ON IT, SIR. BRING US UP TO DATE. WELL, SIR, THEY MORTARED US AGAIN LAST NIGHT. IT'S BECOMING A FAIRLY REGULAR THING. HOW MANY OPERATIONS DO YOU HAVE OUT? THREE RECON AND TWO AMBUSH, SIR. AND THAT COUNTERPART OF YOURS, WHAT -- CAPTAIN NIM. HE'S OUT WITH A PATROL, THE ONE THAT JUST GOT ZAPPED. HE'LL BE IN TOMORROW WITH THREE WOUNDED, SIR. WILL YOU BE STAYING WITH US FOR A WHILE, SIR? I'LL BE IN CAMP OFF AND ON. FIXED A PLACE FOR YOU IN THE COMMO BUNKER. IT'S NOT MUCH, BUT IT'S DRY. GOOD. AND AFTER MAIL CALL, I'VE ASSIGNED MY MEN TO GET CAPTAIN MacDANIAL'S TEAM BEDDED DOWN. MR. BECKWORTH. HE'S A NEWSPAPERMAN. THIS IS CAPTAIN COLEMAN. MR. BECKWORTH IS WITH THE CHRONICLE HERALD. MR. BECKWORTH. CAN YOU FIND A SPOT FOR HIM? AFFIRMATIVE. SERGEANT KENNY! TAKE MR. BECKWORTH HERE TO MY HOOCH. GET HIM SQUARED AWAY. THANK YOU. THIS WAY, MR. BECKWORTH. CAN I GIVE YOU A HAND? THANKS. COLONEL, IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU, THE LIEUTENANT AND I WILL STAY WITH THE TEAM. FINE. THIS WAY, SIR. THE CAPTAIN SLEEPS IN THE BOTTOM BUNK, SIR. WE'LL GET SOMEBODY OVER TO MAKE THIS TOP ONE FOR YOU. OKAY. IS THERE DRINKING WATER? YES, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW COLD IT IS. IT'LL BE FINE, SERGEANT. THANK YOU. RIGHT, SIR. Soldier: WE'VE GOT YOU A PAD AT THE STORAGE BUNKER. YOU CAN HAVE MINE IN A FEW DAYS, I HOPE. TO THE RIGHT HERE. HEY, YOU FUNNY! WELL, I SEE YOU'VE MADE HAMCHUNK'S "A" CLUB. HA HA! YOU FUNNY! HA! AH HA HA! YOU NOT. HA. THIS IS HAMCHUNK. UH-HUH. HE'S BECOME A PERMANENT FIXTURE AROUND HERE. HE'S AN ORPHAN. LIVED MOST OF HIS LIFE WITH MISSIONARIES ABOUT 10 CLICKS SOUTH OF HERE UNTIL THEY WERE ASSASSINATED. MAYBE YOU COULD USE AN INTERPRETER? NO, I DON'T NEED AN INTERPRETER. MISSIONARIES TAUGHT HIM PRETTY GOOD ENGLISH. I DON'T WANT AN INTERPRETER. YOU NUMBER ONE. I CHOOSE YOU. I DON'T WANT TO BE CHOSEN. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH CHOICE. CHOICE, MR. HOBSON? I HAVEN'T HAD A CHOICE SINCE I WAS SELECTED FOR THIS... OUTFIT. YOU'LL GET USED TO ME. YOU FUNNY. YOU -- IN HERE. WHAT IS THE STATUS OF YOUR CREW-SERVED WEAPONS? WELL, SIR, WE HAVE TWO .81s, FOUR .60s, TWELVE .30 CALIBERS -- THREE ON EACH WALL. ONE FOUR-DEUCE. BESIDES CREW-SERVED, WE HAVE SIX M-79s. NO .50 CALIBERS? I'D GIVE AN R & R IN BANGKOK FOR THE SMELL OF A .50. DID YOU HEAR THAT, SERGEANT? YES, SIR. KNOW WHERE THERE ARE ANY .50s? NO, SIR. NEITHER DO I. YOU BETTER TELL SERGEANT PETERSEN. YES, SIR. I ALMOST FORGOT, SIR. CAPTAIN MacDANIAL's GOING TO NEED MORE CORRUGATED TIN. IT'S BEEN HARD TO COME BY LATELY. SERGEANT. YES, SIR, I KNOW. TELL PETERSEN. TELL THE SCROUNGER. PETERSEN! PETERSEN! CAPTAIN, WHAT HAPPENS IF CHARLIE HITS THIS CAMP BEFORE YOU GET IT COMPLETED? WELL, IF HE DOES, AND IT'S TOO STRONG FOR US TO HANDLE, SIR, WE HAVE THREE LZs WITHIN FOUR CLICKS THAT CAN HANDLE 10 CHOPPERS APIECE TO REINFORCE US. ONE IS BY THAT SHALE CLIFF YOU SAW ON YOUR WAY IN. THE SECOND IS TO THE WEST OF HERE NEAR A DESERTED MONTAGNARD VILLAGE WHERE SOME OF THESE PEOPLE USED TO LIVE. THE THIRD IS TO THE NORTH NEAR AN OLD BRIDGE. WHAT IF CHARLIE OVERRUNS THE CAMP? WELL, IN THAT CASE, SIR, THE CAMP IS PREPARED TO ESCAPE AND EVADE ON ORDER THROUGH PLACES IN THE WIRE AND MINES ONLY THE "A" TEAM AND CAPTAIN NIM KNOW ABOUT. MY COMPLIMENTS, CAPTAIN. THANK YOU, SIR. COMMANDER OF THIS AREA RUNS EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK, AND I AM WITH HIM TO THE Nth DEGREE, AND EVERY PIECE OF THIS EQUIPMENT WILL BE PAINTED, AND EVERY PIECE OF THIS EQUIPMENT WILL BE NUMBERED, AND EVERY -- WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT?

MacDanial: I HAVE NO DOUBT. YOUR OUTFIT LOOKS PRETTY BEAT UP. ELEVEN DAYS IS A LONG PATROL, SIR. WE'RE SHORT OF MEN, SIR. WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED EXCEPT STRIKERS. HUH. WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE TROUBLE? WELL, THE MONTAGNARD NATIVES HAVE BEEN SO EXPLOITED AND BLED BY THE VIET CONG, THEY'RE AFRAID TO TRUST ANYBODY WITH A GUN. SAME OLD STORY. HOW MANY VILLAGES ARE THERE IN THE VICINITY? WELL, WE'VE GOT SEVEN AND THERE WERE FIVE, AND WE'VE GOT TWO IN CAMP. WELL, IF YOU GOT ALL THE VILLAGERS IN, WHAT WOULD THAT DO FOR YOU? THAT WOULD GIVE US 300 TO 500. BETTER GET ONTO PSYWAR ABOUT THIS. YES, SIR. WHEN YOU LEAVE, DAI-UY? TOMORROW...HOPEFULLY. DA NANG, NHA TRANG, SAIGON, AND HOME. MY HOME IS IN HANOI. I GO HOME, TOO, SOMEDAY. YOU SEE. FIRST KILL ALL STINKING CONG... THEN GO HOME. WILL THERE BE ANYTHING ELSE, COLONEL? THAT'S ALL, NIM. THANK YOU, SIR. HE SOUNDS LIKE HE MEANS IT. HE KEEPS SCORE ON THE WALL OF HIS HOOCH. HE PERSONALLY GREASED 52 THIS YEAR. SAYS HE'LL DOUBLE IT BY NEXT YEAR, IF ALL THE YARDS WILL GET OUT OF HIS WAY AND GIVE HIM A CLEAR FIELD OF FIRE. OH, I NOTICED A LOAD OF CORRUGATED TIN HAS MIRACULOUSLY APPEARED OVERNIGHT. SERGEANT PETERSEN PROVIDED IT. WELL, THAT'S A GOOD MAN YOU GOT THERE. SERGEANT PETERSEN SAY WHERE HE GOT IT? HE, UH, SAID THE GOOD FAIRY LEFT IT. I HOPE HE SAID, "THE GOOD FAIRY LEFT IT, SIR." CAPTAIN, WILL YOU JOIN US IN THE COMMO BUNKER? FINE. GOOD EVENING, COLONEL. RELAX. SIT DOWN.

CAN'T EVEN KEEP HIS RICE DOWN ANYMORE. WHAT SEEMS TO BE WRONG WITH HIM? I MAY NOT BE THE BEST DOCTOR IN THE WORLD, BUT I'M THE BEST ONE PRACTICING WITHOUT A LICENSE.

WHY WOULD THIS LEG GIVE YOU THAT MUCH BOOZE? MULDOON, HE DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ME. I TRADED HIM FOR IT. TRADED HIM WHAT? I TRADED HIM A MONTAGNARD CROSSBOW, A NUMBER ONE ADDRESS ON TU DO STREET, AND A PAIR OF HO CHI MINH SANDALS. AND WHERE DID YOU GET A PAIR OF HO CHI MINH SANDALS? I MADE THEM. I WORK HARD, I'VE GONE TO CHURCH, I WAS A BOY SCOUT. I WAS AN EAGLE SCOUT! HE'S FUNNY! HEY, HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE? WHERE DO YOU SLEEP? WHERE'S -- ANYWHERE. ALL RIGHT. COME HERE. COLONEL KIRBY.

HELLO, CHARLIE. GET ME CAPTAIN NIM AND COLONEL KIRBY. YEAH. Captain Nim: WHAT ARE THE CHARGES? THIS GENTLEMAN WAS PACING OFF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE WALL AND THE TEAM HOUSE. WE COULD'VE BEEN SITTING IN THERE TONIGHT AND CAUGHT A ROUND DEAD CENTER. I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU CAN PROVE THAT, SERGEANT. [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] EASY, TRAN. KOWALSKI. YES, SIR. [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] MULDOON. SIR? HE WAS A HELL OF A SOLDIER, SIR. YEAH. IS THAT WHAT YOU DO, SPONSOR AN INQUISITION OVER HERE? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA TELL -- I'LL TELL THE FACTS OF WHAT I SAW! WHAT YOU SAW WAS NOTHING! I DON'T CALL BRUTALITY "NOTHING"! THAT MAN WAS LINING US UP FOR A VC MORTAR CREW! THERE'S STILL SUCH A THING AS DUE PROCESS! OUT HERE, DUE PROCESS IS A BULLET. I WANT YOU TO KEEP THAT LIGHTER. THE MAN IT BELONGED TO WAS A MEDICAL SPECIALIST IN CAPTAIN COLEMAN'S TEAM. AFTER DELIVERING A MONTAGNARD BABY, HE WAS ON HIS WAY BACK TO CAMP ABOUT A MONTH AGO, AND... WELL, HIS FRIENDS FOUND HIM ABOUT THREE CLICKS SOUTH BEHEADED, MUTILATED. HIS WIFE COULDN'T HAVE RECOGNIZED HIM, AND THAT VC IN THERE DID IT. WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE HAS NOTHING TO DO -- TELL IT TO CAPTAIN COLEMAN, AND SHOUT IT LOUD, 'CAUSE ARLINGTON CEMETERY'S A LONG WAY FROM HERE. [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] NEXT. OH, IT'S YOU. WHAT IS IT THIS TIME? THAT OLD EAR BOTHERING YOU? METHYLATE. I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU ONE BIT. JUST HOLD STILL. THAT'S IT, DON'T MOVE. THERE. NOW THAT'S MY GOOD GIRL, HUH? CANDY. THAT'S FOR YOU.

RIGHT HERE WILL DO IT. THE LITTLE GIRL IS HIS GRANDDAUGHTER. SHE STEPPED ON A PUNJI STICK. HE'S AFRAID SHE'S GOING TO DIE. HOW IS IT? IT'S A NASTY WOUND, AND IT'S INFECTED, BUT IF WE CAN CONTROL IT, SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. GOOD AS NEW. PRETTY TOUGH WAY TO FIND OUT ABOUT PUNJI STICKS. SURE IS. [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] THIS IS THE CHIEFTAIN OF THE VILLAGE... [ VIETNAMESE NAME ] DOES HE SPEAK ANY ENGLISH? NO, SIR. HE MUST TRUST US. UH, HOW'S THAT, SIR? LETTING SERGEANT McGEE TAKE CARE OF HIS GRANDDAUGHTER. TELL HIM TO COME IN. I DID, SIR. THEY WON'T. WELL, THEN, WHY DID HE COME TO US FOR HELP? [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] HE SAYS, "PAPERS FALL FROM THE SKY." [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] PAPER SAY WHITE MAN -- LONG NOSE, ROUND EYES -- CALLED AMERICANS HELP MONTAGNARDS, BUT, UH, VIET CONG SAY OUR PAPERS LIE. UH, PARDON ME, SIR. [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] YOU LIKE THIS? Sgt. Mcgee: SHE'S A WOMAN, ISN'T SHE? [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] SHE SAID SHE WON'T EVER TAKE IT OFF. AND DON'T YOU TAKE THIS OFF, EITHER. NOW, YOU MAKE YOUR OLD GRANDDAD BRING YOU BACK WHEN THIS IS DIRTY, I'LL PUT A CLEAN ONE ON FOR YOU. [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] OH, THAT'S A GOOD GIRL. [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] HE SAYS THE VIET CONG TAKES ALL THEIR RICE, PIGS, AND CHICKENS, FORCES ALL THE YOUNG MEN TO FIGHT FOR THEM. HE HATES THE CONG. WELL, TELL HIM IF HE'LL BRING HIS PEOPLE IN WITH US, THAT WE'LL GIVE THEM PROTECTION, MONEY, AND FOOD. [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] WHAT'S HE SAYING? HE SAID, "WHAT'S MONEY?" YEAH, HOW DO YOU ANSWER THAT? [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] Col. Kirby: SERGEANT McGEE. YES, SIR? I THINK THE UNITED STATES ARMY CAN SPARE A LITTER. WORKING ON IT, SIR. [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] HE SAYS YOU'RE VERY KIND, SIR. TELL HIM IF HIS PEOPLE ARE AFRAID THAT WE'LL GO OUT AND GET THEM. [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] CAPTAIN MacDANIAL WILL TAKE A PATROL OUT TOMORROW MORNING AND PICK THEM UP. [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] HE SAYS HE'LL DEAL WITH YOU ALONE. HE'LL COME WITH YOU AND YOU ONLY TOMORROW MORNING AT SUNRISE OR NEVER. WELL, THAT'S PRETTY POSITIVE. SUNRISE IT IS. [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. HUH. WELL, LET'S MOVE OUT. Col. Kirby: FREEZE. YOU, UH... YOU SUPPOSE THAT OLD CHIEF WAS WEARING MORE THAN ONE FACE? I DON'T THINK SO, BUT WE'RE SURE GOING TO RESPECT YOUR HUNCH. WE'LL BACK OFF TO THE RIVER AGAIN AND MAKE A DETOUR. CUT HIM DOWN. DO YOU WANT TO HEAR THE STORY, SIR? I KNOW THE STORY, BUT GO AHEAD. CHARLIE CAME IN THE NIGHT TO TAKE THE YOUNG MEN. MOST OF THEM LISTENED TO THE CHIEF AND REFUSED TO GO. THEY KILLED THE CHIEF, AND DID THIS AS A REMINDER TO ANYONE WHO RESISTED THEM. HOW MANY OF THEM WERE THERE, AND WHERE DID THEY GO? [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] SAFE, HIDING ACROSS THE BORDER. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LITTLE GIRL? [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] WHAT DID SHE SAY? FIVE VIET CONG SOLDIERS TOOK HER IN THE JUNGLE. THEY DIDN'T BRING HER BACK. IT'S NO USE. I'LL DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE. IT'S PRETTY HARD TO TALK TO ANYONE ABOUT THIS COUNTRY TILL THEY'VE COME OVER HERE AND SEEN IT. THE LAST VILLAGE THAT I VISITED, THEY DIDN'T KILL THE CHIEF. THEY TIED HIM TO A TREE, BROUGHT HIS TEENAGE DAUGHTERS OUT IN FRONT OF HIM, AND DISEMBOWELED THEM. THEN 40 OF THEM ABUSED HIS WIFE, AND THEN THEY TOOK A STEEL ROD, BROKE EVERY BONE IN HER BODY. SOMEWHERE DURING THE PROCESS, SHE DIED. THESE PEOPLE NEED BETTER MEDICAL CARE THAN WE CAN GIVE THEM. WHERE'S COLONEL KIRBY? I'LL FIND HIM. [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] COLONEL. WE'VE GOT THREE PEOPLE WHO CAN MAKE IT IF WE GET THEM TO A HOSPITAL. SEND FOR MY CHOPPER. I CAN TAKE THREE. COMING ALONG? I'M STAYING. I SEE THEM, DAI-UY. PARDON ME. WEAPONS CHECK IN 30 MINUTES! FALL OUT! [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] PETERSEN! OUR INFORMATION CHECKED OUT. CHARLIE'S BUILDING CASKETS AND LADDERS, AND I MEAN A LOT OF THEM. HOW FAR OUT ARE THEY? ABOUT 15 CLICKS. THAT GIVES US PLENTY TO DO BEFORE THEY GET HERE. RESTRICT ALL OPERATIONS TO WITHIN FOUR CLICKS OF THE CAMP. YES, SIR. WILL ALL SYSTEMS BE OPERATIONAL BY DARK? AFFIRMATIVE. GOOD. MAY I SUGGEST WE CONTACT "C" TEAM, SEE ABOUT THE WEATHER? ALL RIGHT, FINE. PETERSEN? YEAH? WHAT WAS ALL THAT ABOUT LADDERS AND COFFINS? OH, WHEN CHARLIE KNOWS HE'S GOT A NICE BOX TO BE BURIED IN, WHY, HE'S JUST AS BRAVE AS HELL. THE LADDERS? THEY THROW THE LADDERS ACROSS THE WIRE TO GET AT US. THEN, LATER THEY USE THEM FOR LITTERS. BY LATER ON, YOU MEAN WHEN EVERYBODY'S DEAD? EVERYBODY. WOMEN. CHILDREN. EVERYBODY. COME ON, HAMCHUNK. COME. COME ON, HAMCHUNK.

THEY MURDERED HIM AND HER LITTLE BROTHER IN A MOST HIDEOUS WAY. THAT'S THEIR STYLE. BESIDES BEING ONE OF OUR TOP MODELS, SHE COULD BE MOST HELPFUL TO OUR GOVERNMENT. ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME SOMETHING, COLONEL? UH, THAT GENTLEMAN SEATED WITH HER, HE'S A DOUBLE AGENT. HE WORKS FOR US AND FOR GENERAL PHAN SOON TI. WELL, THEN, TELL ME, COLONEL, WHO WILL SHE BE HELPFUL TO?

THAT'S IT. THERE IT IS, SIR. ARE YOU SURE THAT'S WHAT HE SAID HE WANTED? AFFIRMATIVE. THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED, AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S GONNA GET. WELL, MAYBE HE LIKED THE IDEA OF HAVING SO MANY MEN THINK ABOUT HIM EVERY DAY. BESIDES, IT SINGS. "IT SINGS"? YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. IT SINGS. PROVO'S PRIVY. IT DOES SING. THE LAST TIME WE THREE MET, COLONEL CAI AND I WERE GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT A PLAN WE HAD, THEN "A" CAMP 107 GOT HIT. THIS CAN'T WAIT UNTIL YOU TAKE OVER, SO I WANT YOU THOROUGHLY BRIEFED. WHY WAY OUT HERE? THIS IS TOP SECRET, MIKE. I REPEAT, TOP SECRET. COLONEL CAI. HOW WAS SAIGON? VERY INTERESTING. I ATTENDED A MEETING WITH THE PREMIER AND HIS STAFF. THE MAIN SUBJECT WAS GENERAL PHAN SOON TI. OH? HE HAS ASSUMED COMMAND OF THE ENTIRE VIET CONG FORCES IN THE SOUTH. WHICH MAKES HIM NUMBER ONE. AFFIRMATIVE. AND IT COULD MEAN A MAJOR OFFENSIVE. I HAD MY HANDS ON HIM THE LAST TIME I WAS OUT HERE, BUT I COULDN'T' GET ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO HOLD HIM AGAINST POLITICAL PRESSURE, HAD TO TURN HIM LOOSE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET YOUR HANDS ON HIM AGAIN? WHO WOULDN'T? BUT IF I KNOW GENERAL TI, HE'S SURROUNDED BY A REGIMENT. MY PEOPLE THINK SEVERAL. THAT BRINGS US UP TO THE PLAN, COLONEL. HE'S SOMEWHERE IN THE HONG PHAU VALLEY. SURROUNDED BY THE REGIMENTS YOU MENTIONED, WHICH MAKES A CAPTURE IMPOSSIBLE. PRECISELY. EXCEPT FOR ONE WOMAN AND A CERTAIN HAND-PICKED TEAM. GO ON, COLONEL. THIS IS THE RAT. AND THIS IS THE TRAP. MY FATHER WAS A SIMPLE MAN. ALL HE WANTED WAS TO BE FREE, HIS WIFE TO LOVE AND HIS CHILDREN TO RAISE. HE TRIED TO REMAIN NEUTRAL. THAT WAS HIS MISTAKE. WHAT HE DIDN'T REALIZE WAS THAT MAN HAS TO PAY A PRICE FOR THAT FREEDOM. THEREFORE, HE SUFFERED THE ULTIMATE PENALTY. SINCE THAT DAY, I'VE LIVED WITH BUT ONE THOUGHT -- TO FIND THE MAN WHO ORDERED MY FATHER AND LITTLE BROTHER MURDERED. I FOUND HIM. HIS NAME IS PHAN SOON TI, AND I WILL GIVE HIM TO YOU. WHEN? ONE WEEK FROM TONIGHT AT THE OLD COSTEAU PLANTATION. COLONEL CAI KNOWS WHERE IT IS. COLONEL, HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS GIRL? HER FATHER AND GENERAL TI'S FATHER GREW UP TOGETHER. THEIR FAMILIES WERE VERY CLOSE. EVEN BEFORE HE MOVED TO HANOI, HE HAD MORE THAN A FRIENDLY INTEREST IN LIN. DO YOU TRUST HER? OF COURSE. SHE'S MY BROTHER'S WIFE. LET'S SEE, IT'S 0400. THAT MEANS WE'LL HIT THE DROP ZONE AROUND A LITTLE AFTER SUNRISE. EVERYTHING ALL SET? YOUR GEAR'S ON BOARD, SIR, WITH COLONEL CAI'S STUFF. THANK YOU. LET'S GET ABOARD. ALL RIGHT, YOU HEARD THE MAN. STICK FORMATION. LET'S GO. KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN, MIKE. DON'T WORRY. COLONEL CAI, YOU HAVEN'T SAID A WORD ALL NIGHT. Col. Morgan: YOU KNOW WHY? HE'S NEVER JUMPED BEFORE. OH, FIRST ONE'S EASY. IT'S THE SECOND ONE THAT'S HARD TO GET THEM TO MAKE. COLONEL. OH. HA HA HA. WE'LL USE THE ALTERNATE PLAN BRAVO, AREN'T WE, SIR? RIGHT. ALTERNATE PLAN BRAVO! KOWALSKI, THAT MEANS YOU TAKE POINT. IF YOU SEE ANYTHING, DON'T LET THEM SPOT YOU. FREEZE. LET US KNOW. GOT IT? GOT IT. ONE MINUTE TO DROP, SIR. THE RECON WAS A SUCCESS. PROBABLY BE NO TROUBLE, BUT THE WORD IS "ALERT." GET READY. PORT SIDE, STAND UP. STARBOARD SIDE, STAND UP. HOOK UP. STAND IN THE DOOR. GO! GO! YOU READY? SIR, KOWALSKI'S GOT ABOUT A 5-MINUTE START ON US.

WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT'LL MAKE A NICE MESS. HOW MANY MEN WILL YOU NEED? DOC AND TWO OF COLONEL CAI'S MEN. YOU GOT THEM. [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] IF WE DON'T GET BACK BY 1100 TOMORROW, YOU BLOW IT, HEAD FOR THE RENDEZVOUS. GOOD LUCK. THANK YOU. MOVE OUT. HOW COME YOU LIKE BLOWING THINGS UP SO MUCH? WHEN I WAS A KID, MY DAD GAVE ME A CHEMISTRY SET, AND IT GOT BIGGER THAN BOTH OF US. [ ORDER IN VIETNAMESE ] [ ORDERS SHOUTED IN VIETNAMESE ] [ ORDERS GIVEN IN VIETNAMESE ] Sgt. Petersen: THE WAITING'S OVER. NO ESCORT. YOU ALL KNOW YOUR JOBS. REMEMBER, WE DON'T GO BACK WITHOUT THE GENERAL, NOT ONE OF US. QUESTION? MOVE OUT. WAIT HERE. [ SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ] WINE? LATER.

[ AIRPLANE ENGINE ] Petersen: COLONEL, I HEAR THE PLANE. INFLATE. PETERSEN, TAKE THE REAR. WE'D BETTER GET OUT OF HERE. COULD I HAVE A CHOICE JUST FOR THE HELL OF IT? YEAH. I'LL TAKE THE POINT. I SAID YOU COULD HAVE A CHOICE. THAT'S WHY I'M TAKING THE POINT. Sgt. Petersen: SIR, WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE TO THAT RENDEZVOUS AREA. WELL, YOU BETTER GET OUT THERE AHEAD AND SEE WHAT'S WAITING FOR US. ALL RIGHT. RELAX. COLONEL, SHE'S YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW. SHE IS. HER WHOLE FUTURE, HER SELF-RESPECT -- EVERYTHING IS IN YOUR HANDS. WELL, I -- IT ISN'T THAT I... THANK YOU, MIKE. THANK YOU. LIN... YOU'RE A BRAVE WOMAN. NO, JUST A WOMAN PRAYING THAT HER FAMILY WILL FORGIVE HER. THERE'S NOTHING TO FORGIVE. [ SOBBING ] I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER GET HERE. CHOPPERS ARE ALREADY COMING UP THE VALLEY. WHERE'S DOC? CAUGHT ONE IN THE BACK, HE'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET THE COLONEL. LZ IS A MEADOW JUST OVER THAT RISE. LET'S MOVE OUT. MOVE OUT. AAH! Sgt. Muldoon: PETERSEN! BASTARDS! MOVE OUT.
