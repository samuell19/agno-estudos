(siren wailing) (tires squealing) (metal crunching) - [Girl] Well, I don't know where to get ahold of him. I don't wanna marry him. Leah, it was just that one time. It was a joke. And 10 lousy dollars. He's gonna marry her. Leah, what are we gonna do? - [Woman] Are you still sleeping? - [Girl] I don't know what I wanna do. - [Man] Selling potato chips is my game. - [Girl] Well, you don't have too much longer to decide. God, we have almost $2,000 in here. - [Girl] Well, we'll mail the rest back when we get to LA. - [Girl] Damn it. Do you wanna call Daddy? Do you want to go home so him and his girlfriend can treat you like an object instead of a human being? (siren wailing) (uptempo music) (subdued music) (people chattering) (kids shouting) (engine revs) - [Girl] Hey, Cindy! Hey, wanna hop in? Cindy, come on. Come on, hop in. - [Cindy] No, thanks. - [Girl] Come on, we'll have a good time. - [Cindy] I can't. I have to go home. - [Girl] Aw, come on. - [Cindy] No. - Hey, Cindy. - Come on. - Hey, get in. - Come on, Cindy, hop in. - No, thanks. I gotta go home. - Come on, Cinderella. Let's take a cruise in the old pumpkin. - I don't think so. - [Boy] Aw, come on. - [Girl] Just let me talk to her, will ya? - [Boy] All right. - Hey, Cindy. Cindy, why don't you come with us for a couple of hours? We're just gonna gear around for a little while, huh? - Right, you weren't in school today. - I'm not gonna be there on Monday, either. - [Boy] Hey, Leah! - Hang onto it. - What do you mean you won't be in school Monday, either? - I'm splitting. - Well, where are you gonna go? Why would you wanna leave? - That's why I got these jocks to find ya. I wanted to see you before I split. - Come on, Leah. Leave her alone if she don't wanna come. - Hang on a minute. Bye-bye, boys. - Hey, you ain't quitting on us like that, now are ya? - What are you talking about? - Hang on a minute. You want the date, my name, or just a good long scratch? - [Boy] Hey, my brother paid a fortune for that. - How about a nice picture of your nose? - Come on, man, be cool. We're splittin'. - [Girl] Go try the elementary school, geek. - Sit on it, turkey! - And that, my friend, is how you handle puberty. (laughs) - You know, I wish I could handle myself the way that you do. - You know, you just gotta live in the right environment. - Right. Is that why you're leaving, or is it your folks? It is your folks, isn't it? - Yeah, well, my dad got boozed up again last night, you know? Beat the hell out of me, took my money. Money I made babysitting for the brats next door instead of using his own stash. I mean. - Well, I don't understand that. Where was your mother? Didn't she have anything to say about it? - She stood around, you know, as usual. She took his side and she slapped me around a bit to prevent him from slapping her around. But you know, I know where they keep their loot, so I coped it. And now I'm splitting. Hey, come on. I'll buy you a pepperoni pizza, huh? - A pepperoni pizza? - You love it. No, wait. Anchovies. - I hate pizza. - You love pizza. Okay, smothered, like with onions and tomatoes. - Where do you plan to go? - LA. You know, a person could really get lost down there. Nobody gives a damn what you do. I was never close to too many people, you know, around here. Well, I guess I was the closest to you. Well, I guess I had to tell somebody. Are you gonna eat that? - No. - Then I will. (laughing) I remember when your mom was alive, she used to give us money for pizza. We used to come down here and gorge. - I know. - You must be either on a crazy diet or else you're pregnant. What I plan to do is to go down to that truck stop. You know a geek will always take me somewhere. Get a trucker to take me down to LA. You know, I used to hang out with a trucker. - Leah, I'm pregnant. - Yeah, I'm sure. - It's true. - That's unreal. By who? - Do you remember three months ago when the National Guard had that camp out here? - The National Guard is up there every month. - Right, but they're from all over California. - Jeez, and the most I could ever get from one of those guys was a look. - He was really nice. - Did you find out how nice and tell him? - I don't know how. - You open your mouth and you say hey, geek, Joe, or buddy, whatever the hell his name is, I'm pregnant. - Well, I don't know where to get ahold of him. I don't want to marry him. Leah, it was just that one time. - Let's get out of here. I mean, haven't you ever heard of the pill, or the diaphragm, or 7 Up or anything? Christ. - It started when Daddy started bringing Diane home on the weekends. I felt so uncomfortable. I felt like I was in the way. So I took the keys to the car and I went to the movies. We met there. When I went home, it looked like he was busy, if you know what I mean. So I left and we wound up behind a football field. - In the car? You did it in the car? I mean, that's ancient. That's like right out of a '50s movie. It was your first time, huh? Well, gee, you know. I always figured you were... Uh, have you told your dad? - No. I was gonna tell him today, but I don't know what to say to him. - Yeah. Hey, why don't you come with me? Why don't you come with me to LA and we'll get rid of it? Or we can keep it. - Leah, I can't go. - Well, I know if I came home with news like that, I'd get kicked out. - My dad'll help me. - Yeah, sure. Sure he will. Well, is there anything that I can do? - Stay here? - Anything but that. Hey, but you know where to find me. Just look for me in the movies. - Right. - Or in the nightly news. (horn honking) Hey, there's my ride. Hey, Jo Jo! The dog-faced boy. Look at that face. (laughing) Hey, Jo Jo. How about a ride in the country? - [Jo Jo] Hop in. - All right. You take care, good buddy. I'll be seeing you, okay? - You, too. (tires squealing) (uptempo guitar music) Bridesmaid? (engine starts) (horn honking) Hey, Leah. Let's go. You can't be in the movies without me. - Didn't work out, huh? - Mm-mm. Come on. - Catch you on the flip-flop, good buddy.

(steam hissing) (laughing) - Look at this. - What happened? - I went home and there was a note and 10 lousy dollars. He's gonna marry her. Leah, what are we gonna do? - Well, first off we're gonna take care of you. - How? - Well, you can abort or you can keep it. - I don't know what I wanna do. - Well, you don't have too much longer to decide. - I know. Well, where will we live? - We'll get a great apartment right down where the action is. Cindy, we'll decorate it just like we want it to be. We're free, Cindy. We can do whatever we want to do. We are. - Then you know what I'd like to do? I'd like to get on down the road. - Then that's what we'll do. (laughing) I mean, who could turn down two good-looking, in-trouble chicks like us? - When in trouble. - Stretch, then get your mind off that. - All right. - Trouble? - Yeah, car trouble. You wanna give us a lift? - Oh, I'll give many a lift, sweetie. Hop in. Charlie Peterson's the name. Selling potato chips is my game. What's yours? - Modeling. - Modeling, huh? Hey, I know a lot of models and they've known me. High fashion or low? - In-between. - In-between. That's a good place to be, in-between. Yeah. Yeah, I recognize you. I've seen some of your ads. - Yeah, my biggest was panty hose. You know, the kind that don't show any wrinkles? - Yeah, that's it, that's it. Sure, panty hose. A gorgeous set of gams you've got. Groovy. You wearing them now? - Never wear anything else. - Uh, don't tell me. You're uh, uh... Bras? - You're real sharp. - You're real right. I couldn't forget you. - And what potato chip do you sell? We've done some chip ads before. - Oh. Blue Belle chips. Greatest chips in the world. They're uniform, they're stored in a can to keep in their freshness, they're tasty as all get out. I wouldn't eat anything else myself. - Mm, you're making me hungry. - I'm a good salesman. - Do you have any in the car? - Oh, hell no. I don't like to carry 'em in the car. They smell up the place. You girls heading for a new job? More panty hose? Hey, I'd really like to catch one of them sessions when you do. Uh, I'm not fresh, I'm just friendly. You dig me, beautiful gams? - Yeah, I dig it. But, you know, it makes me nervous with you driving with just one hand on the wheel. - Oh? - Why don't you pull over to the side of the road and let me drive, then you'll have both hands free. You hep to it, Kojak? I love it. - I used to have a thick head of hair. Kind of long, you know what I mean? It got too much to take care of and washed it every day. Well, I just figured one day I got real tired of it and I kind of shaved it off, you know? I haven't had any trouble since, except with the ladies. Well, they just love it. You know what I mean? - [Cindy] Mm-hmm. - Dynamite. - Actually, it's not my car. I mean, my own car. It's the company car. - Oh, well, Charlie. With all the potato chips that you sell, even if we did crack up, you could pay for it in a minute. - I hate those damn chips! I haven't sold one all week! - Hey, don't worry. She hasn't wrecked one in a month. (laughing) - You know, when nature calls, Charlie, you gotta go. Listen, I'll be back in a couple of minutes. And when I come back, you can take us on to the next spot, okay? And we'll have a little fun in-between, huh? - However you preach, sister. (tires squealing) - [Leah] My wallet! Come back here with my wallet, you bald-headed geek! - What happened? - He took off with my wallet, all of my money. - Well, I've still got $10. We can get a ride and catch him. - Yeah, in 10 minutes when the sun goes down, he'll be hiding in some cave and I won't be able to see the shine from his head. (laughing) Come on. - [Cindy] What about my dad's car? - [Leah] Just leave it. It'll get picked up and back to him. - [Cindy] We can probably get it back with a 10. - We're gonna need that when we get to LA. - [Cindy] Leah, we're gonna need a lot more than that. - So, we'll model. Hey, just worry about it tomorrow, okay? - You're not Scarlet O'Hara. This isn't the 1800s. - No, but we'll make it. We'll make our own luck our own way. Look, nobody's gonna provide for us, but us. There's no great provider in the sky looking down on us, watching out for us. - You're not into religion, I take it. - Come on, you know my story. I had it crammed down me before my dad crawled into his bottle. 10 Commandments, Cain and Abel. Lot's wife turned to salt for looking back on the people who wanted to live. I learned that pretty early. God ain't nothing but a dirty old man with a bulge in his pants. No, I'm not into religion, I'm into me. - I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry. That's my philosophy. Your feet hurt? - Yeah. - [Leah] Sit down. - You know, I don't know what my philosophy is. - You'll find it pretty soon now. - How? - I guess what I should've said is that it'll find you. Don't worry about it. - I'll worry tomorrow, right? - You got it. Are you hungry? I'm kinda hungry. - A little. You wanna get something? - Yeah, in a minute. - No, let's get it now while I've got the 10. - Yeah, we'll need that for LA. Oh, here's dinner. - Hey, girls. Wanna go for a ride? You're all alone out here. - Hey, sweetie. - Hey, girls! (laughing) That's a good one. - Really. Now, I haven't seen you two around. Are you new? - Yeah, we're just passing through. We're on our way to Los Angeles. - Well, what you gonna do down there? - We're models. Our car broke down a ways back, so we're stuck here for the night. - Well, where are you staying? - You wanna offer us a place to sleep? - No. We live at home, but we could take you out and then have a little party at your place. Show you some good times, some hospitality. - It sounds like fun. - Well, what are we waiting on? - Nothing. Well. - [Leah] You like to boogie? - [Boy] Oh, yeah. All the time. (people chattering) - Wait. So, are we gonna stand in the rain or we can go somewhere. - Well, we could go to the Moonlight Club and dance. - That sounds like fun. - Hey, who owns that? - Well, that's Tank McCall's. He owns most everyone and everything in this town. - Owns my old man's mortgage, that's for sure. - You're kidding. - Well, when I take over I'm gonna give it all to him. Then I'm gonna go to LA myself. Hell, I ain't no country boy. - No? - Well, when are we gonna start? - Hey, you guys know the territory, you know. - Well, why don't we go to your place? Yeah, we'll go to your place first, have a drink. You guys get cleaned up and then we can have a little fun. All right with you? - It's okay with me. - When did we get that last penicillin shot, Cindy? What was that about a week ago? - It was about a week ago. - Yeah, let's go. - Penicillin? - Yeah, it's okay though. - Hey, Al. We gotta get up at five in the morning to do those chores, don't we. - You know, I completely forgot about that. We're gonna have to go. - Yeah. - Really. - Hey, come on. Let's boogie. - Jesus, we're country boys and we gotta work. - That's right, we are country boys through and through. I don't think we can stick around, really. I mean, nice to see you girls in the morning. Good night. We have a lot of work to do. No staying out late on a work day. - [Leah] Run. That's right, you just run. (laughing) - God, I don't believe it.

You wanna go home and watch him and his girlfriend treat you like an object instead of a human being, huh? All right, well then just go. Take your lousy $10 and split. Just get out of here, will you? Hey, I'm sorry, you know? Yeah, I'm scared, too. Hey, I'm no rock. Look, we may not make it, but let's try, okay? - Okay. - Hey, why don't we use the 10 and stay at that motel we passed on the way up here? We'll, you know, get some rest. - We can worry about things tomorrow, right? - Right. This is Charlie's wagon. This is his car. And look, there it is. Look. - [Cindy] That's your wallet. - Right. Right on his dashboard. He must be around here somewhere. I bet he's in there. Let's check it out. - All right. (uptempo rock music) (people chattering) - Hey, you know what Ford gave to Carter after the last election? His used Edsel. (laughing) - How you doing, Kojak? - Hey, what the hell. Where you girls been? I've been looking all over for you. You know, you left your wallet in my car. - Yeah, I know. - I've been going up and down these streets looking for you. I even went back to the car, I came back to town. Where you been? - Can I help you? - I'll have a Tom Collins. - You're crazy, you know that? I'll take you girls to where you're going, but you ain't getting behind the wheel. You can bet your sweet butt on that. - A glass of white wine. - So, where you been hiding, huh? Hey, look, look. I'm no thief. I wouldn't run off with your purse. Hey, how about some dinner, huh? - We've already eaten, thanks. - Oh. Well, how about a drink then? It'll loosen you up a bit, huh? - Hey, you buying these girls a drink? - Look, do I look so cheap that I can't afford to buy these ladies a drink? What are you having, ladies? - They've already ordered. - Oh. Oh, well then bring her over then, Joe. - My name ain't Joe. - I thought all bartenders were named Joe. - Can I see your IDs? - Everything set, Swede, Curly? - Yeah, everything's set. - That's good. Now look. When you get the goods stashed in the car, deliver the car to the house and leave it. Jake and I will drive it across the border to the laundry and bring it back to ya. Clear? I think I just figured out a way to kill some time while you boys are busy tonight. (chuckles) Curly. - [Charlie] You girls better take off. - I'm not going anywhere until I get the wallet that I left-- - Sit. - Hey, hey, wait a minute. I haven't finished my dinner. - You're finished. - The hell I have. I haven't even gotten it yet. - You had it, my friend. Tank McCall's buying. It's on the house. - Who? - [Curly] Tank McCall. - He can't push me around. - He wants you to leave. - Well, that's tough. - He owns the place. - Well, he don't own me. - It's 10 minutes from here to the highway. Less if you drive. - What are you doing, running me out of town? - I bet you can walk a lot faster without a cast. - Get your hands off. (grunts) - Excuse me. Give 'em whatever they want. Tank McCall's buying. He'll be right here. Just sit. - Okay, come on, buddy. Joe will take care of ya. - I wasn't even looking when you hit me. - Everything straight? - Absolutely. - Sure? - Really. - Move. - What are we gonna do? - We'll see. We'll probably have a place to stay, anyway. Look at the bright side of it. At least he can't get you pregnant. - Thanks. (subdued music) - Comfortable? - Fine, thank you. - Yes, fine. - Can I fix you a drink? - Yes, I'd like Coke and scotch. - [Tank] Coke and scotch. You? - White wine and 7 Up. - White wine and 7 Up. You know, ladies. I'm gonna call you ladies because I'm gonna treat you like ladies if that's all right with you. - Please, do. - Not at all. - We've had a wonderful dinner. Now we're here in my home and we're gonna get comfortable and we're gonna get to know each other. I think you should have one of my special Courvoisiers, 25 years old, smooth and mild. A mild drink for mild people like us. You know, I like people. A lot of people think I don't like people because I'm hard and because I run things around here, but you have to be hard, you know. I own the town, but I can't own the people, right? Anyway, this drink'll relax you. It'll warm you. Put you in the right mood. Hey, it's nothing for nothing in this life, you know? For what you give, you get. For what you get, you gotta give. Hmm? Isn't this comfortable here, just the three of us? I can make a fire if you like. - [Cindy] Yeah, it is pretty chilly. - Hey, how would you like to take a shower, I got a great shower. You can take a nice hot shower. There's robes. Nice terry cloth robes in the closet. - [Cindy] That sounds nice. I think I will. - Great. Now. Hello, Leah. - Hello. The fire? - [Tank] The fire. - All right, let's get into position. - Hey, that Cindy girl friend of yours really digs her showers, doesn't she? - Yeah, she likes to be clean. She likes everybody to be clean. - Oh, yeah? (laughing) So do I. - Oh. - Curly, I think it's coming. Hold on. - [Curly] I see it. - Yeah, it's... Hold on. Fire it up. It's coming. It'll pass in a second. Yeah, here it comes. - Could I have some more of this? This is great. Just, you know, another drink. - Yeah. - Loosen up, you know. (engine revving) (metal crunching) - [Man] Get the car, get the car, get the car. - Boy. - You're next. Wash up? - Yeah? Oh, yeah. Okay. - Kissing that is like kissing a freshly used toilet plunger. Let's just get out of here. I'd rather sleep in the cold than squeak the springs with jelly roll. - Okay. - Come on, let's get dressed. - I wanna get out of here, too. - Hey, Tank! Hey, Tank! Nice. Real nice. Where's Mr. McCall? - Here. - [Man] We got it. It was easy. - Shut up. The car ready? - [Man] Yes, sir. Right out front. - Well, go out and wait in the car. I've got some unfinished business here. - Yes, sir. I understand. - All right, go on, beat it. I'll be right back. There won't be any more interruptions. - Wow. - Leah, hm-mm. - He won't miss half of it. - Yeah, but that'll make us thieves. - I wouldn't be surprised if Moby Dick got it the same way. Get dressed. I locked him in the bathroom. Come on, let's go. - [Reporter] Police agencies are on full alert in a state-wide action to catch the gang responsible for a multi-million dollar armored truck robbery. The bandits rammed the armored truck with a specially devised juggernaut device with which they ripped open the currency transport. - Where's Mr. McCall? - He's inside. He wants you to bring out the bags. - What is this? He never takes no bags. - They're our bags. We're coming along for the ride. - Yeah? - [Cindy] Uh-huh. Do you mind if I ride up front with you? - No. Not at all. - The bags? - [Man] Oh. Oh, yeah. I'll be right back. (engine starts) (uptempo music) - [Tank] They're getting away with the goddamn money and the car! That's two mil, you dumb son of a bitch! Now, get after them! I'll skin you alive if you don't find them! (tires squealing) - Oh, no. Here they come, Leah. - And here we go. (engines revving) (tires squealing) - Who the hell was that? Aren't you supposed to be driving that thing? - Two broads, they stole it. - [Curly] With the money? - Tank said we gotta get 'em. - [Curly] Tip, get in the goddamn car. - Are they still there? - [Cindy] Yeah, except there's two of them now. (phone beeping) (uptempo country music) - Hello? - Turn off that goddamn radio when you talk to me, you idiot! - We're after 'em, Tank. - Find 'em and then call me. - Well, can't you go any faster?

Doesn't that sound good? - And we'll think about tomorrow tomorrow? - Right. - All right. We'll hide the car. We'll walk to that hotel. That way fatman's men will never know where we are. - [Cindy] Okay. Great. (bell dings) - [Clerk] Good evening. Can I help you? - Yeah, we'd like a room. - [Clerk] Double beds? - It's not necessary. - No car? - No, we're walking. - Yeah, our car got stuck down a ways. Won't be ready till tomorrow. - [Clerk] You leave it out to Johnson's place? - Johnson's? - Only one open in town this late. - Yeah. Yeah, that's where we left it. - Oh, LA. - Yeah, we've been visiting. We're on our way back. - I see. I don't see how you live in all that smog down there. I like the fresh air up here a lot better. - Yeah, well, can we have our room? - That'll be $15 in advance. Policy. I trust you, but policy. - Yeah, I left my wallet in the car. You want to pay him? - [Cindy] Sure. - Um, you girls expecting any visitors this evening? - Why? - Just curious. Don't get a couple girls like you coming through here much alone. Thought maybe I could be on the lookout. Somebody might come visiting ya. - Look, nobody's visiting us and we're tired. Let's go. - Do you sell toothbrushes and toothpaste here? - No, ma'am. - Can I borrow yours? - I didn't bring it with me. - There's a store about a half mile up the road. Sort of a liquor store market. They got 'em there. - God, after drinking that brandy and kissing that blimped-lipped geek, my mouth feels really bad. I know a way you can help me. - [Clerk] Well, if I can, I sure will. - Could you go get me those? A toothpaste and toothbrush? - I sure wish I could, but policy. I can't leave the place. - Policy? - Yes, ma'am. It ain't that far, really. - Do you have a car? I'll pay you. - [Clerk] No, ma'am, I don't. - Well, I guess I'll just have to walk. - Yes, ma'am. - [Cindy] Let's go tomorrow. - [Leah] Thanks anyway. - Why don't we wait till tomorrow? - Why don't you just go in? I realize that you don't feel so well in your condition. I just wanna get rid of this. - Then take the car. - I don't think that that's too wise. Why don't you just go in here and I'll be back in a couple of minutes, okay? - All right. - Tank, we had a slight problem. Swede took out a car lot and we lost 'em. - [Tank] Okay, okay. - We're right outside of Water Valley. We're going the same direction we saw 'em last. - Now look, we've gotta get that car back. As soon as that truck is found, every road in this state's gonna be closed. And we gotta get that money across the border before then. You understand me? Is that clear? - I understand ya, Tank. Yes, I understand ya. - Okay. - Jake, it's getting hot, goddamn. You go to the north end, double back. We'll start here and meet ya, okay? They gotta crash somewhere. - Right. - Go ahead. (tense music) (knocking on door) - [Cindy] That was really. - I thought you girls might like something to relax you. I noticed you're traveling kind of light. - I don't think so. - Tip, check the office. (knocking on door) - There ain't nobody there, man. The door's locked. - Check the parking area. - There ain't no cars out there. - Check it. - The man has a no vacancy sign on his door. - Check it anyway. - You got it. - [Cindy] No, thanks. - Name's Albert. We can just have a sociable little drink till your buddy gets back. I wouldn't want you to think Water Valley wasn't a sociable little town. - I don't want anything to drink. - Well, we'll see. - [Reporter On TV] Tore open the doors of the armored vehicle in seconds. So far, speculators are saying that no local gangs could be responsible. - Go on. It'll relax ya. Really. - I guess one will be all right. (horn blowing) (tires squealing) - Now, just how much do you girls charge? - Charge? - [Albert] I saw that wad of money you got there. You didn't get that clerking somewhere. - So, you think... Oh, you've made a big mis-- - Hell, I've seen your kind come through here before. - Well, you're wrong. - Now, you be nice. Be nice and maybe we can work something out on the room here. (knocking on door) - [Leah] Hey, Cindy, open up! What the hell is going on in here? I said, what the hell is going on in here? - [Albert] Okay, now your partner's back. We can talk this thing out. - Do you know what he thinks? - I saw the wad of money. You're hookers. - You're sharp. - I've seen your kind before. - Yeah, well, we're taking the night off. We're kind of tired. Why don't you come back in the morning and then we'll talk business, huh? - I'm just the night clerk here. Somebody else will be here in the morning. It's tonight or never. I'd hate to wait that long. - Oh, in that case. - Leah. - It'll just take a minute. Why don't we just take your jacket off here. You got a cute face, you know? (grunts) (uptempo music) Oh, my god. (engine starts) - [Jake] Yes, Tank. Sure, Tank. Yes, Tank. - Let me see that. Tank, we've been all over Water Valley. We can't find 'em. - [Tank] You better find 'em. Keep on going and find them or I'll find you. - We'll move to Freegate. Let's go back to the highway. - Just pull over somewhere. I'm so tired. I'm dead tired. We're gonna have to rest. - Where? - Anywhere, it doesn't matter. Just pull over to some road. We'll sleep in the car. We'll hide in the car, okay? - Okay. - You wouldn't have a couple young chicks staying here, would ya? Maybe checked in in the last hour or so. - One blonde, one dark haired? - Yeah, that's them. - They just left. - Which way'd they go? - I don't know, but if you get 'em, kill 'em. - This is fine. Even if the man's men do come up here, even if they come up the road, they're not gonna find this house. Let's just sleep in the car. - What about the people in the house? - Well, they're farm people. They went to sleep with the chickens. (laughing) It's all right. - All right. You know, I wish I were home. - [Leah] You do not. You wish you were in LA or else you would've never even left. - Maybe. - [Leah] No maybe about it. Just go to sleep, okay? - Goodnight. - [Leah] Goodnight. - Leah! - Shh, shh. Quiet, quiet. I'm not gonna hurt you. - What do you want? - I live here. I heard your car outside and I thought that you needed a little help. Thought maybe you were in a little trouble. That's why I came out here. - Uh-huh. Well, we got lost and, you know, we were a little tired, so we thought we would sleep in the car. - Car ain't no place to sleep. Me and Mama, we got plenty of room. Why don't you come inside. I see she's up. - Come on. - All right. - Oh, jeez. Can't you guys function at all without me? - We see our children most every week. Yeah, they still live around here. Here, Daddy. You get that one for me. Thanks, doll. Yes, they still live very close to here. Can't move far away from mama and daddy. You know how that is. And I wouldn't have it any other way. Either would Homer. They're still growing up and all. Did you know that they are still our babies? Look, I wanna show you some pictures, you girls. - Now, look. Curly, Tip, and Swede will go after them. You come back for me. When? Now, you fool! Okay, you understand. That's nice. - Yes, there they are, there they are. All of them when they were young. Most of them, five of them. Look, Homer. Why, we're boring these young ladies. When all they really want is a good night's sleep. Okay, come on now. I'll put this aside and you come on. - I bet they bedded down somewhere. - Tank ain't gonna like it. - Well, what are we gonna do, drive these streets all night? - What do you think we ought to do then? - We're going to Freegate, watch the main road going into town. When they come in, we'll get 'em. - Yeah, right near the takeout place. I'm starving. (laughing) - You're always starving. - Goodnight. Now remember, the bathroom is right in there. And fresh towels for both of you. Oh, can I call you at any special time? - That's okay. Just let us sleep, okay? - [Cindy] We're tired. Thank you. - Oh, don't say anything about that. Well, I guess we'll see you in the morning. Goodnight. - And goodbye. God, I thought they'd never let us get to sleep. - Yeah, well, I enjoyed it. - Yeah. - Do you suppose things could be different? I mean, really nice like these people. - Nothing ever changes. Nothing's ever different. Oh, this feels good. - [Cindy] Leah? - Yeah. - Do you suppose we could change how we are? - You're pregnant. How are you gonna change that? Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Now remember, when you girls come back through this way, we are going to be very disappointed if you don't come by and say hello. Aren't we, Homer? - Oh, you bet. - Thank you for putting up with us. Bye. - Bye-bye. Don't pick up any strangers. Bye. Have a nice trip. (laughs) - All right. - God, this is terrible. Tastes like warm cardboard and hot oatmeal. - Let me. I'll eat it. Let me eat that thing. - [Curly] You slob. - Leah, pull over, please. - [Leah] Are you all right? - [Cindy] Yeah. - Is it as bad as they say it is? - It's worse. - Well, I have some toothbrushes and toothpaste in the car if that'd help any. - It wouldn't hurt. - All right, I'll get 'em. ♪ Everything's turning upside down ♪ ♪ Going in circles, putting my head around ♪ ♪ Everything's going so slow and fast ♪ ♪ Afraid of the future ♪ ♪ I'm scared of the past ♪ ♪ But I've got no time to worry much ♪ - I've already brushed once today.

(laughing) Roll down the hill. - It's relaxing, my dear. Warming. - [Leah] I'm locking the car. (laughing) - I'm gonna catch some sleep before Jake and Tank get here. - All right, don't get too comfortable. I'm gonna have to wake your ass up in a few minutes. - Yeah. - Now, beat it. Did you eat that sandwich already? - Almost. I'm hungry. - Yeah, you're always hungry. - Oh, God. My clothes stink. - Mine do, too. - Why don't we go into Freegate to buy some new clothes? And then we'll leave the car there 'cause Tank probably has his goons after us already, you know. And then maybe we could take the bus to LA. How's that plan sound? - It sounds good. - All right, let's do that. - We're good. - Shit, it's all over the news. By this time they've got roadblocks everywhere in this part of the state. - Yeah, but those chicks don't know what they're sitting on. - It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. If the cops pick them up, search the car and happen to find the money, how long do you think it's gonna take them to tie it in with us and find out that car belongs to me? - I know what you mean, but what about the girls? - Frankly, I don't give a good goddamn what you do with them. But right now, we've gotta find them. Find them quick. I want this town combed and I want you to keep listening to the news. If you hear a flash that they've been picked up with the money, head across the border and meet me at my place down there. Got it? - Right, Tank. - Okay, beat it. - Cindy's never ran away before, Lieutenant. There's never been any trouble between us. That's why I believe something else has happened to her. - I understand, Mr. Braddock. Bill. Bill, did you push these to Water Valley, Freegate, and surrounding territories? - Yeah. - That's the description you gave us. Nobody's gonna be able to give it much time what with that armored car knock over yesterday. - She had money, enough for gas. If she wanted to run away from home, she could've gotten a lot farther than where you found the car. I'm sure. - Well, we'll see what we can do. - Thanks. - They're gonna notify us here if they're spotted. - Water Valley? - Right. - Hit Freegate. - Right. - You mind if I wait around here for a while? - Suit yourself. - [Mr. Braddock] Thanks. - Look at that right there. - Oh, I love it. Hey, that basket would look great for our house. (laughing) - Yes, may I help you? Is there anything in particular you girls are looking for? Something for a special occasion, or a party, or something like that? - Jeans and tops. - Oh, jeans. We've got all sorts of jeans. Yes, they're right over there. We've got blue jeans over there. We've got every color. We've got black, we've got navy, we've got white, we've got powdered blue. You know, that faded denim color and all that kind of stuff. We've got yellow ones. Oh, we've got short shorts. You know those kind of denimy kind with all the flowers and stuff. If you look right over there. And while you're looking, just look around. We've got all sorts of paintings, you know. People in town like to keep there murals here. It gives that place, you know, that sort of je ne sais quoi. We just kind of love it here. - Do we have enough money for this stuff? - [Clerk] We've got the greatest little handkerchiefs and we've got perfume to match by the same person. His name is Min Wa. Oh, he's just right from my hometown here. - God, we have almost $2,000 in here. - Well, we'll mail the rest back when we get to LA. The rest we'll pay back when we get a job. Hey, we can't worry about it. It's done. - Well listen, if you wanna look over there on that counter right over there, there's some African prints. And we've got, you know, the caftans in the short and the long. And we've got some boutiques over there in the back. We've got some sun dresses if you're interested in anything like that. - [Leah] That's okay. We'd like these. - [Cindy] How much will it be? - Well, let me see now. That would be about three... Let me see, three and 2.50. - [Cindy] And this, too. This, too. - Oh, that, too? Just a minute, let me see. That's 4.50. And the pants, those are 15. And that would be 12. Five, and am I missing anything? Yes, here it is. 10, six, and that's five, four. Oh, excuse me for a minute. Let's see, 77.36 including tax. Will that be cash or charge? - That's cash. Cindy, you wanna pay her? - Well, listen, you keep your receipts. And if they don't fit you, you can always bring them back. - [Leah] Yes, ma'am. - Oh, my. Birthday present from your mommy? Let's see. Let's see, that's 77.36. Well, I'll just put 'em all in a bag for you. - [Leah] No, that's okay. We just want to try them on. Where are the dressing rooms at? - Oh, the dressing rooms are right over there on the corner, all right? - [Leah] Great, we wanna wear them out. - Fine, fine. And if you want to, when you're through, I'll show you some jewelry that we have. - [Leah] Oh, yeah. - Oh, excuse me. My goodness. There you go. - [Leah] Thank you. - There you go. Hope you enjoy 'em. - [Leah] We will. - Bye, now. - Bye. - Bye. - [Clerk] Let me know when you're through. - [Leah] Uh-huh. - Listen, we've got roadblocks up all over the place and we're checking every car that goes through 'em. I tell you, they're not gonna get in here. Now, let me do my work and leave me alone. Sheriff Smith speaking. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Uh-huh. Well, what's wrong with a hundred dollar bill? Hell, I'd like to have one of them myself. Was it on a hot bill sheet? Well then, what are you worrying about? - But, Sheriff Smith, I know there's something wrong. I mean, girls walking around with a wad of bills like that. - Look, ma'am. I've got a lot more important things to do. All right, all right. Dark-haired girl about 18. Blonde, same age, 5'9". Right, I got it. Well, I sure thank you, ma'am. All right, uh-huh. '68 or a '69 Cadillac. Right. What color did you say? Pastel Blue. Okay, well, I sure thank you, ma'am. I appreciate your... Look, ma'am. I've got work to do. - My goodness. As a taxpaying citizen I thought it was my duty to... Oh, thank you very much, sir. The materials will be in next week. Thank you. - What? Talk your ear off. Give me the sheriff's office in Hemerston. We've got runaways here. - Thank you very much for coming in. Y'all come back, hear? - Bye. - Bye. - [Clerk] Bye now. - Should we leave the keys in the car? - I wouldn't. You want someone to steal it like we did? - Okay, then lock it up. You know, if we catch that bus, we can be in LA by tonight. Why don't we try and get tickets? - All right, let's go. (tires squealing) - There it is. (tires squealing) - Yeah, I got it, Sheriff. Blonde, about 17 or 18 with a dark-haired girl same age. Yeah, right. Yeah, I'll keep my eyes open. - [Swede] There it is, Tank. - I see it, you dumb son of a bitch. - [Swede] You got a spare key? It's locked. - Oh, Jesus. Damn it, can't you do something? Go on. - [Swede] I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it. - Jake, go inside and get those two broads. - Right away, sir. - [Cindy] I'm dying of thirst. I've gotta get a Coke. - Another one of your cravings? Just hurry up or else we'll miss the bus. Don't move. There's jelly roll's hatchet man. Okay, when I say go, we're gonna go to the left, okay? Okay, go. - Cover me. - Jerry, damn it. Where the hell are you? - Hey, Larry. - Swede, Swede. (siren wailing) - Yeah, it was them, Sheriff Smith. I'm sure. I'm sure. Yeah, right. Uh-huh. Yeah, okay. Young girls, I wanna see you. It's official business. I've gotta get out of here. This is official business. - [Man] Hey, come on, man. What are you doing? (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) (siren wailing) (tires squealing) - In pursuit, '71 Pontiac, two-tone green. License number 2-7-6, lemon, Kansas, Roger. Oregon plates. Headed down Arrow Highway East Pass. Need assistance. (siren wailing) - Now, hold it back, Jake. Just keep 'em in sight, that's all. - I know. They're on the highway headed toward Hemerston. I'll call over there. Have the father stand by. I'm going after them myself. (siren wailing) (tires squealing) (metal crunching) - I might've gotten killed. What the? Bastard! - [Dispatcher] Car 42 Adam in pursuit of suspected runaways in light-colored Cadillac. Come in, please. (uptempo music) (siren wailing) (tires squealing) - [Officer] Pull over or I'll blow you away. - Oh, God! Oh, God! - Hold on, I'm gonna ram 'em. - [Cindy] Leah, he's gonna hit us! (tires squealing) (siren wailing) - Well, they haven't found the money. I think we better make an entrance. - [Jake] What if they do find the money? - Well, we'll just tell 'em it's Curly, Tip, and Swede. Be my word against theirs and around here my word carries a lot more weight. - [Jake] Meaning you'd sell 'em out? - So would you. I mean, unless you wanna wind up in the slammer. Now look, we're just here to pick up the car that belongs to me. Got it? - [Jake] I got it. - [Leah] Cindy, Cindy, are you okay? - It's my stomach. Something's happening. - Just hang on, okay? Just hang on. - Cindy, honey, are you all right? - Daddy, I'm sorry. - Don't you worry about anything right now. We'll get you fixed up. Leah, what's been going on with you two? - Nothing. Nothing you'd understand. (siren wailing) - Tooley. - Hey, that your car over there, TJ? - Yep. - What the hell's going on here? Them your boys too over there, aren't they? - Ah, I just guess the boys got drunked up a little bit, that's all. - What about them girls? - I don't know nothing about them. - Mr. Braddock, this is TJ McCall. That's his car. - [Mr. Braddock] Look, I'll pay for any damages if it was my daughter's fault. - Well, that won't be necessary. The insurance company will take care of everything. I just hope your daughter ain't hurt too bad. - [Mr. Braddock] Thanks. - Want to come to the office and press charges? - Nah, it was a mistake, Tooley, you know. Jake left the keys in it. Kids were just joy riding. It's all a misunderstanding. I don't wanna press any charges. I just want to get my car back, that's all. - Good. This damn armored truck robbery has turned us upside down. - (laughs) I'll bet. Why don't you just run along and take care of all the things you have to take care of. I'll settle up here. I've got everything I need. - I have to take your boys into the office. - Yeah, all right. That's okay, too. I'll send a lawyer down and fix everything up in a short time. - Appreciate it, TJ. Let's go, boys. Gotta get back on the robbery. (siren wailing) - How you doing? - It hurts. - [Leah] Well, next time we're gonna make it there. - Are you pregnant? - [Cindy] Yes. - You're miscarrying. - Please, don't tell my father. - [Medic] That the way you want it? - Please? - You got it. - There's not gonna be any more problems after this.
