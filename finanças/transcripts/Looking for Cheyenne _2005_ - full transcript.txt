My beloved, you do not talk to me, tear up my letters. I only have thought transfer. So, listen to me. I do not think so that our love is impossible. I do not think so that you endure this absurd world. My beloved, There are things you do not want to understand. I do not like this world either. Do I have to make it hard for me? I can not and do not want to be like you. I do not believe in misanthropy, but try to love this world. I've just turned on a guy. I took him to me. So what annoys you, I know but believe me, me too! I would like to be radical, without paying the price. Neither loneliness, still of my spiritual and material well-being. Actually I am the idealist From us both. Who are you talking to? With no one. I have to be alone. HAVE NOT SATISFIED IT, DAILY TO SIT BEFORE THE TIC? You have a wife, but you do not look at her. She does not care. You are only interested in your plate. Listen... I am tired. I am working. I am HR manager at Echelle Européenne. My working days are unimaginable. Believe me, through the financial crisis It does not get better either. I just like to see what I eat. I know my wife for 10 years. - In 10 years you change. You could sometimes look. - I prefer not to look closely. We got 10 years older. Old bags, that's all. Did you cook that? - Naturally. It smells good. Are you hungry? Do you want to eat? - I do not say no. Thank you. For me, love is something else. I met a woman and want to live with her. I hope we will never be like her. Eat, before someone comes before you. That's pretty, is not it? This is sodium chloride. It is also called ... - Soda. ... soda. I poured copper sulphate for that. This is how the blue is created. The cations give the blue. This solution is very concentrated. What's going on there? Wait, I'll be right back. Kevin and Said, what's up? He fucked me. - At school? Flap! Private business rules please out of school, yes? - Okay. Sit down. Do not you have any lessons? - The history teacher is missing. There is no. - What you do not say. There is no? - Nobody was assigned to us. They think we do not need one. - There should be a representation. Then come to me best. - Oh no... As a scientist you can Do not hurt a bit of chemistry. Well, come on. Come on, hurry. What do you want? - I'm in love with you. I can not use that right now. You can not choose "that". I'm Gay. We slept together. You are bisexual. Is there a woman? - Yes. That does not change anything for me. I'm not jealous. I want to have a child with you. - You are crazy. Yes, perhaps. Well, here it is not. It is not here either. Look, we are almost there. I live here. It's small, but, what the hell ... It is my nest. It's nice. What's that? - I write leaflets. Are you in a party? - No I'm alone. LOVE IS STRONGER THAN MONEY THE WORLD IS MAGIC ... ... YOU WANT FRESH AIR, BUT KEEP YOUR CARS Was he in my mailbox of you? - Yes. Why do you want a child? I do not know... To teach him things. I'll go then. Excuse me. You want to be like everyone else, but that does not work. That the one who has ears, hear. May I? I have never seen you before. - I have not been here for a long time. Somebody let you sit. - no. I left her. Is it a long time ago? 17 days. You count the days. Is it really out? "Dear lucky ... ... only takes a moment. Heartache ... ... the whole life." What is your name? My name is Béatrice. And I really like your smile. Thank you. So ... let me guess. She cheated on you with a guy. No. With a woman? - Neither. Alcoholic ... drug dependent? Not at all ... On the contrary. Very virtuous ... Too much? Hot! - She came to the monastery. Something like that, but that's not it. Give me a hint. A merger separated us. - A merger? She has become a volcanologist and fallen into a crater. No... It is an economic merger. She assumes a top position in Singapore. No, probably the opposite. She has been fired. Staff reductions. What did she do? - Journalist. She was a good journalist. She was unemployed, did not find anything new ... ... no legal claims anymore. Without money you can not pay bills. Telephone, electricity ... Especially if you refuse help. She has decided that she does not need all this. She made a philosophy out of it. She lives by candlelight. Luckily she has a fireplace, otherwise she would be frozen. She can not until spring be cleared away, but then ... She did not want to move in with me, because I support the system. I did not want to freeze anymore. I went. Above all, I want one thing: you forget. I'm only interested in passion. I like excesses. What would life be without exaggeration. With moderation is idiotic. For example this woman ... I want to see her suffer. Slowly torment her. She is not in love yet, but ... As soon as I get out of reach ... ... she will cling to me. I like her very much. I notice it that I want to see her suffer. He who does not suffer does not live. I'm already suffering for her. If you like me told by this madman. Cheyenne. Then I feel very bad. In the meantime she slept with me though. Funny, this urge to suffer. Where does that come from? - Who are you? There are other types to feel alive. Maybe more pleasant. - How did you get in? I am her lover, she always carries me with her. Sonia? So you like to suffer? I want a harmonious relationship. Hand in hand, cheek to cheek. The view in the same direction. So she sleeps with men. - That happens. We complement each other, you give her Passion and me partnership. I'm not jealous. She can have both. I'm jealous! And I love her. Sonia belongs to me. She let you sit. Do you know each other? - Your ex, a full-length theme. Who are you? Pierre, I'm in love with her, too. That does not count. Sonia will never love you. From morning to night she just thinks about me. So, go away. - I only smoked one ... Smoke and you are satisfied with your miserable life? Are you? Is not there something wrong with you? Does prosperity make you happy? Cheyenne ... What are you doing here? And you? What are you doing here? We should leave her alone. Is there a little thing to eat? - I have cheese. Cheese is good. I need you. - I also you. Life is hell. - No, rather war. Life does not like losers. You have to be just as hard. Anyway, thanks for the cheese. bye - Bye. Wherever I am, I keep thinking about you. - How do you mean? Where are you? By Edith. - Edith ... It has to be super cold. - We make fire, there's wood everywhere. You'll see, it's beautiful. Even if you pout, you are pretty. - I do not sulk. I'll miss you when I'm gone. - Did you get transferred? No. But after the Easter holidays I stop. I am making for 1500 euros no longer crooked. I found a job at Toyota. Applied physics and good pay. I need the money. You can not understand that but children are expensive! What's wrong, what's wrong? Is it because I'm leaving? - no. Or, yes. When did you decide it? Last year, and then I had to find something. Look ... Is everything alright? - I only have a headache. Do you still have your girlfriend? - Yes. Is it going well? - Yes, it works fine. And ... would not you like a guy? And you ... would not you prefer a guy? In three days turn off the power. Crap. I will pay the bill. - You will not pay anything! I do not want anyone lying on the bag. What you wanna do? I will get along without electricity. That's what people did earlier. Without a telephone, without a computer and all that shit! I sell all this. It only costs extra money. Do not bother me with your coal! I do not want her! Why can not I help you? - I do not know! So, where is this bill? Stop this calculation. I will never live pay another bill! Chill out. - Why should I. I have no more money. Do you understand? No work, no unemployment benefits, no money! I will end up on the street too! Stop the nonsense, I'm just helping out. You give me the money back, once you have found work. I am looking for a year. There is none. Is not that in your teacher's head? There are 3 million unemployed! Stop yelling! - I do what I want! You need comfort. Good that I am here. I wanted to comfort someone today and thought of you. But I have no desire for sex. - Then we eat something. I'm not hungry either. - Then let's talk. She played for a long time to quit thinking. I did not believe it. Now everything is too late. She was gradually setting, and I just watched. My love is no good. She is very nice and good, but it's no use. Can I make someone happy? - Of course. You are also nice. I'm bothering you, and you come back anyway. You don’t annoy me. You're alive. I like that. Shall I take you with me, girls? - Stop it, it annoys. Did you think about the garbage cans? Who is this guy? - A shit-sixty-eight. He thinks everyone is like him. And this thing with the garbage cans ... - nonsense! I should pay council tax to use the garbage cans. That is impossible, that you should pay for garbage cans ... You can talk about that. - It can be talked about ... They take the coal Certainly not for the garbage cans. Your system is global. They talk about solidarity, but actually they nail you tight. Believe me, the world is bad. I live as it suits me, until it pops sometime. I want their fucking machinery do not support a bit! I talk too much since you arrived. It's alright - It bothers me though. Should I go Again? All right, I want you to stay. Bugger me... Wait, not so fast. Not so fast! Halt, I almost lay down. You just get older. In the cold you can hardly breathe. Are you kidding me? Are you serious when you say that. And the move on Rue Poulet? It took only 2 hours. - We were 20, Edith. I say, you're getting older. You certainly do not want anything. Anyway, you've always looked younger. - The alcohol breaks. It's not the alcohol, but the lovesickness. Do you still think of this woman? - The whole time. Come on, go on. I did not tell you that I have something running. With Vladimir, he works in Passonfontaine. We met twice already. - Super. Sometimes he speaks Russian. I do not understand a word, but I like it. Bugger me... I can not anymore. Come on. I'm too old. I belong in the garbage bin. What do you need, to create that sound? A vibration and a resonance box. The resonance box is for transmission the vibration on an air layer. That's a sound. He is the vibration of a layer of air, which spreads in the air and gradually gets to your ear. Sonia, are you listening to me? I keep thinking about you. I want you to come. I want to live with you, be happy with you. Be quiet. Be quiet! What's the use of being a teacher? Did you ask yourself that? What are 5 minutes of her attention against the television? This is called the scale. What's this? A sequence of tones, defined by exact frequencies. We will find out that the rules of the musician also apply to the mathematician. Behind the principle of the scale is a mathematical theory, as old as Pythagoras. We will discover in what connection the scale with the magical world of numbers. You do not save her from the K. O., So, why are you working? This is a low frequency generator. To buy batty things. That's how you keep the machinery going. Here I have a speaker. Why am I doing this ... I vary the frequency, which makes the speaker vibrate. You know that it can not go on like that. So... You hear the speaker. Now we do some math, say, divided by 2. If you have a good ear, that I go down an octave. Sonia, are you listening to me? - Do you hear? That's the only way you can resist. Stop consuming, stop producing. Stop making passive propaganda. Good. I know you know it. Believe it too. I love you. Sonia, here is Béatrice. Now listen... I have a naughty suggestion. Do you want to spend the evening with me? Eat something, and have a good movie. I have a lot of funny horror movies ... At nine o'clock with me? Bring something to nibble, Champagne is here. I would be very happy, to see you. I am not ready yet. Good, we'll go on next time. Have a nice Weekend. Cindy, wait for me. Goodbye, madame. - Have a nice Weekend. You are really nasty, we wanted to go together. First, I'm doing my Abi. - The Abi brings nothing. You're good, too. - It does not work. It's not for me to run away. Besides, I'm under 18. My parents could start a search ad. Can I sleep with you? - no. And what I need to do? - I do not know. You're crazy. Slut! Hello Béatrice, this is Sonia. I received your message ... It is clear. I am also happy to see you. At nine with you. I kiss you. Madame ... Can I speak to you? - Yes of course. What's happening? - I break off the school. My father is unemployed, I have a job. In Brittany, paint boats. - What a crap. And a scholarship? Can not your mother do anything? Scholarships are paperwork, and I do not care about my mother. She and her guy would kill me. I stole her money, before I left. All right, come with me. Tonight I visit a friend. You can still sleep here anyway. Do not you come back? - Only tomorrow morning. She lives pretty far away and needs some comfort. This is your lucky day. Is probably your thing, save friends ... - Yes. There is something to eat in the fridge. Just feel like home. We already find a solution. - I already have. Another solution. They are optimistic. - You are pessimistic. Well then, have a nice evening. Sonia, it's me, Pierre. I know that you are there. She's not there. - When will she come back? Tomorrow morning. May I... I have a printer problem. Yes... - Yes. Pierre. - Sandy. Did not Sonia tell me anything? - No, she is my teacher. Your teacher? - She helps me because I have problems. She visits a friend tonight. I just wanted to print something. Leaflets, to be exact. "The media preach good spirits, while the state laughs at us. " "You have wretched ideals, and conduct idiotic debates. " "Love is stronger than money." Are not you hungry too? Oh, I'm sorry. I met another girlfriend I have been waiting for an hour. We are not married. I stink of beer, right? Great, that you are there. ... With a girlfriend. We wanted to get away to Brittany. Actually today, but she let me sit. She was afraid. Everyone is afraid in this Kackland. We are not to be regretted. - But everyone is afraid of that. That's totally stupid. So you want to stop school? What does Sonia say about that? - She does not agree. She wants to convince me of the opposite. I also disagree. Are you about to go to school? You do not remember as it is, in high school. There are hardly any teachers and no supervisory staff. Everything is super-dingy. Nobody goes to the bathroom, Blackmail, rapes ... We eat contaminated meat. Unbearable! Then you do not have to go but fight. You have to strike. Strikes do not help. Do not listen to the television. Sooner or later, it will be useful. As with the chaos theory. Fart in Tokyo, a butterfly dies in Sydney. By the way, I have already eaten. Are you hungry? I still have some cheese. - No, it's okay. I have with my girlfriend talked about your ex. Cheyenne. The story with the stream she thought she was great. What did we laugh ... Tell me, are you mad at me, or what? Do not you want to undress? Come on... Do not pull that face. Do not pull a face ... You are beautiful. Wait, not in her bed. She will not come back. - But still. Then we go to the canapé. - Okay. Wait ... you're wonderful. - How so? Just because... Come on. Béatrice, is it ok? - Go away, it stinks. I go. We do not love each other. I go. You are probably romantic. Exactly, forgive yourself. Are you a nurse or something? Should I pay you too? Maybe you have some change? Thank you. Thank you. Good luck. Everything okay? She is young. She may not want children yet. I adapt. - I see. She needs love, and I can give her to her. I do not know where to go with mine. Are you leaving? - I miss you. Cheyenne? You are both alike. You think everything is easy. If we are similar ... then she loves you. Here are the keys. Take care of the little one. Is good. Good day. I am looking for Edith. She lives in a caravan. I think they are two. Edith ... Do you know her well? - No, I know the brown-haired girl. Ah yes, the little brown-haired ... They are inseparable. They are at the "Seignes". At the end of the road, You can not miss it. It is a ruin with trees. - Thank you. Good luck. They are not very sociable. Bite that? How did you come here? - I rented a car. Are you showing me your home? It's over there. Do we take the car? - no. I do not get into those things. Do not you remember? Yes, yes. Tin boxes ... really bad. Can I leave it here? Nobody ever comes here. That's the beauty. But, as you can see. I came by. That is also beautiful. Sonia, Edith ... - Good day. Is that all you have caught? Then we eat the rabbit. Come over. Hello. Vladimir - Cheyenne. Good day ... Sonia. - Hello. Have you had a good trip? Sonia arrived today. I've been here for a while. A moment... Here you go. Thank you. So then... On the love. And, do you move to us? Are you applying for social assistance? Hurry up, soon that will not happen anymore. What do you mean by that? Do you want Cheyenne? about to get to Babylon? Stop, Edith. Do not attack her. Cheyenne can do whatever she wants. I just missed you. Ah I understand... So a weekend visit. Enjoy the fresh country air. In the cities... ... there are too many people. That's bad for the head. I was in Strasbourg, there were too many people. I became crazy and hit someone. I went to jail. You know, Loneliness can also drive you crazy. I live here for 5 years. I prefer to live alone, as in bad company. I used to be a journalist, like Cheyenne. I was constantly dealing with people. Either I divided the room with morons, or drove through France, to interview idiots. I've seen enough annoying that's enough for two lives. And since you only have one ... I need others to live. Enjoy it, because soon it will be over. - What? It will all explode it is not good! The others ... That's all a fake. You pay contributions for those in need but you lose the job yourself, you have no rights. Where did your post go? In the throat of the speculators. I'm just relying on myself, I will not be fooled like that. I do not want from anyone be dependent on the actionist system. And I do not want to be a shareholder ... Do you understand? Yes I understand. That's your view. I do not want to owe them anything. That's why I do not want social assistance. But that's another topic... Right, Cheyenne? Eat, it will be cold otherwise. Yes ... she should eat better. I go to bed now. Are we cuddling? - I do not feel like. Come, we give each other some love. That does not hurt anyone. I do not love you. - That does not matter. I do not love you either. Where is the problem? I'm not intrusive. I'm leaving soon anyway, I have work in Perpignan. Then shut off. Right now? - You go. Then you better leave immediately! I do not understand you, Edith. - It's enough, go away. Vladimir! Vladimir leaves. You should look for Edith, she is not feeling well. I do not want to get involved. Come, you'll get your death. You know, I thought. I could ask for my transfer. For this year is it too late, but ... We could us settle in the area, together. What do you think? I do not know, I'm thinking about it. What does this mean? You need a car ... ... and electricity for your corrections. - Yes, sure. I do not want a cottage in the country, we have already discussed that. You do not want to live with me? - Nobody forces you to work. You do not need much to live. - I like my work. Are not you tired of it? to support the system? What do I support? And you, with your social assistance? You had a great job. You have talent. You should rather fight. - You can not win this fight. I want to build something else. - What? A life, regardless of the system. The more people join in, the better. Growth becomes impossible you have to support the decline. With even more cars, we all suffocate. - We have already talked about that. I will leave. In the car it is at least warm! Stop, do not get upset. I just need some time. Are you kidding me? Are you serious when you say that! It was stupid of me to come. Wait wait. Give me my shoes. - We love each other, Sonia. Everything starts again! We love each other, but there is no solution. That's the way it is. That's all I can do. And you not too. Bye. Are you going? - You are too stupid, I'm leaving! Sonia! Sonia, please stay. I want to live with you, we need to talk. Sometimes you say "hü", sometimes "hott". You do not know what you want! You are cowardly. I should comply with all your wishes. You just block off. You are not inventive. It takes a lot of imagination, to live together. But that scares you you had to crawl out of your hole. I wanted to invent with you. But if you do not want, I will not do it alone! All right, we invent together ... Do not go. Hop in! I do not get into those things. So you do not bother? It's stupid what you do. So you do not get in? Well then, bye. She is gone. I know. Maybe it's better that way. - You do not understand, we love each other. You do not know what love is. Why are you so angry? Excuse me. You're just scared to be alone. - And you... Are you afraid of the proximity of others? Why did Vladimir leave? It's my fault, I was not made for it. What I am looking for does not exist. - Yes, it exists. Do not fuck it, Cheyenne. She wants to bring you back to Paris. Maybe it's no use. - He's right. If we do nothing, nobody does it. We have to let others know, the more the better. Good day, madame. - I hope I do not disturb you. We are preparing the strike. Great. Are you going to strike with us, madam? Should I tell you something? You will have a hard time. Even if you gets a history teacher. You do not learn anything, because the teaching program is reduced. He will try to be interested in anything You discuss television programs, everyone is allowed to say something. It rings, and the lesson is over. At the end you have the Abi. Does she get the intermediate diploma, Are you unemployed less quickly? I thought, everyone is responsible for his life. Now I do not believe it anymore. You have no power left about your life. Others make decisions due to statistics. Stop the freedom, Self-realization ... It's war. War for scholarships, Economic war, whatever you want. Anyway, we all serve only as cannon fodder. Of course you can demonstrate. You have nice memories. You can take drugs, destroy you, Playing video games. Everything is better than doing nothing. You are delivered to the entertainment industry. There is nothing else. And should you accidentally revolt, then you are weak, because you were not loved enough. You are offered healing methods: Yoga, antidepressants ... You are spoiled for choice. Sorry, Pierre, I fall in the back ... No... That does not matter. Come on, we'll continue somewhere else. Are we going to the cafe? - Yes. Goodbye, madame. - Goodbye. We prefer to go, you look tired. - No reason to be discouraged. Goodbye. - Goodbye. You need to rest, Madame. You need some hope in life. Leave me alone. I'm sick of the hope! I puke your wretched ideals. Have fun with your idiotic strike. I tell you, fuck it! Goodbye. - Goodbye. I wanted to thank you. - Yes... All the best. Did it go bad? - You made her hot. They do not believe me, what i really think. You have to discover the world yourself. Will it work? - Yes, it will work. Open up, I'm here. I'm waiting for you. My bike is broken I was hitchhiking.
