Well, uh, I think if you got everyone's input up front... I mean, right from the beginning, you can- - Susan, have a drink. - What? Have a couple of drinks. It's a party. - [Sighs] - [Elevator Bell Dings] ## [Continues] [Laughing] Look at this! [Laughing Continues] [Laughing Continues] [Laughing] Oh, God! Josh! I'm glad you could make it. Bet he gets another raise. Now, that's what I call a tuxedo. I rented it. This is a real bow tie though. I tied it myself. - That's why I was late. - No, you're not late at all. - Let me show you around. - There's Miss Patterson. Hi. There's a guy from the meeting! - Would you like a drink- uh, champagne, glass of wine? - No, just some milk. Why not? You on the wagon? No, I'm at a party. [Chuckles] # [Up-tempo Jazz] It works on your hips. You need a whole other exercise for your thighs. It's true. Hi. Let me grab a plate here. Excuse me. This looks good. ...from the I.R.S. tells me that I can't amortize like that... s-so I show him the schedule... and then he says, "It's not accepted accounting procedure." I say, "You little pissant." [Man] Try a little bit of, uh- - That looks good. - Yeah. Want to get a load of that guy. He's, uh, overdressed. - Look, my feet really hurt. - Yeah? You want me to rub 'em? You know, most people, they don't know how to rub feet. Think it's in the thumbs. It's the knuckles. - Now put some eucalyptus oil on- - Just-Just dance. - It's great. - Oh, it's great. - I'm having a really good time. - I'm really excited about this. - Ignore him. Just ignore him. - I don't know him. - The guy's a goddamn knock-off artist. - What do you mean? Amphibian? He takes 10,000 G.I. Joes... slaps some gills on 'em, webs their feet, packages 'em in seaweed. - There's not supposed to be pieces in mousse. - Carrot. - But the toy sold, Paul. - Excuse me. - Hi. - Hi.

You wanna get outta here? - Uh-huh. - Let's go. [Coughs Loudly] [Man] Watch it! - [Coughing Continues] - [Man] Did you see that? I'm not really a big one for parties. I like things that are a little more... intimate. Wow! Is this your car? Well, it's the company's car. - This is the coolest thing I've ever seen! - Yes, sir. Sir. [Door Locks Clicking] Just seeing someone in the office... you don't really get a chance to know them. Just being with you here, I really get a sense of- - [Slurping] - of who you are. - You gonna eat these fries? - No, no. - Hey, mister, you want some of these fries? - No. No, thank you. See, it's hard, in a business situation- I mean, there's this invisible line, and- and even if- even if you're attracted to someone- - [Beeping] - You're gonna call someone before- - [Out-Of-Service Tones] - No. Uh, I mean, at this point in my life- - [Radio: Static, Changing Frequencies] - Don't- Don't play with the ra- Leave the, uh- Don't - I'm really vulnerable right now, you know, and l- - ## [Radio: Pop] - I mean, I love my job. - And- - ## [Continues] - And l- - Ejector seat!

Leave it! - ## [Pop] - Would you quit it! - [Radio: Switches Back] - Do you have to play with everything? [Giggling] - [Shrieks] - [Train Whistle Tooting] - Baskin. - [Shrieking Continues] Baskin? [Shouting] Wouldn't you rather play basketball? I know how to play that. - We could be a team for the MacMillan Company. - No! I'm not very good at sports, but I'll give it a try. My best sport's video hockey. - That isn't a sport. - Well, it takes eye-to-hand coordination. - It's not a sport if you don't sweat. - What about golf? And you're not sitting there letting some machine do all the work. - What about car racing? - Shut up, Baskin! - What are the rules again? - I told you. Over the line on the serve. Yellow is out-of-bounds. Play to 21. Ready? - Sorry. Sorry. - One-nothin'. - Hold it. - Get it! Get it! Get it! Attaboy. - Okay. You ready? All right. - Yeah. [Grunts] - Ho ho!

No, I did not! Now, give me the goddamn ball! Well, that's cheating. - Give me the goddamn ball, will ya? - No! - Give me the ball, you little shit. - It's my serve. - Give me the goddamn ball! I never said that! - Yes, you did. Give me the- Give me the ball. Give me the ball! - Give me the- Give me the- - [Man] This is new. - [Bystanders Laughing] - Come here.

Ohh. - You don't play his game. - I tried to play his game. He beat me up. If he's scared of me, then why did he punch me? He punched you because he's scared of you. - I don't get it. - It's just the way he is. Everything's a fight with him. Everyone's an enemy. It's not just a job for him. It's a war. How come you're so nice? - What? - You work as hard as he does, and you're not like that. You don't know me that well. Yes, I do. You're one of the nicest people I've met. How do you do it?

Good night. - [Knocking] - Come in. - Hey, Josh. - Hi. What time is it? - It's 10:00 or somethin'. - Mmm. What are you doin' here so late? I finished up on the Astro Blaster. So? What do you think? It's okay. I know what you mean. Astro Blaster, Laser Might- They're all the goddamn same. Wasn't always that way. I remember there was this duck once. You mean, like, a-a rubber duck for the bath? No, no, no. Just a... little, wooden, quacky duck. And a string on the bottom and you pulled him forward, he'd waddle from side to side. And I realized... if you put the head on a hinge, just a little wooden dowel... then the beak would peck at the ground when it pulls forward. - See? Oh. [Laughing] - [Laughing] - Just- I had an idea. - [Laughing] Look at this. Come over here. You know what this is? It's a report on how to expand the heavy adventure market past the 12-year-old cutoff point. - You can't do that. It doesn't work. - Why not? Y-You can't keep a kid from growing up. All a 13-year-old boy wants is a 13-year-old girl. And I sure don't know how to build one of those. - [Speaking French] - [Tape: Woman Speaking French] - What's this? - What does it look like? Shampoo, razor, toothpaste, two neckties and your exercise tape. - Susan- - And I want my keys back. - [Keys Jingling] - Sure. [Sighs] It was just some scratches, honey. He'll get over it. - It has nothing to do with him. - Oh, what is this, then? Your one big moment of redemption? Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good to me. Come on, Susan. He's just another link in the chain. First it was Tom Caulfield. Then Handlen. Then Golding. Then me. Am I missing somebody? It's not like that anymore. What is so special about Baskin? He's a grown-up. Susan- I can't believe you brought up Golding. Can't believe you slept with him. ## [Piano] # [Singing In Italian] - [Gasping, Laughing] - Oh! Catch. Catch the dough. Catch! A little piece of dough over there! Here it come! Throw me the dough. Right here. Hey!

It's your birthday. - I have to go somewhere. - Where? Where? Um... well, I have to go meet somebody and- - Slag out all night. - Yeah, I know, but, see, l-I just- Well, I can't right now. But I'll call you. All right? Okay? I'll give you a call. Thanks again, Billy! It was fun! - Hi. - Hi. - Do you want to come in? - Sure. [Both Chuckle] Sit down. - Wanna go? - Yeah! Yeah. Okay. ## [Calliope] [Riders Screaming] Wanna go again? How come you have all these points? 'Cause I'm just tappin' 'em. You don't have to kill 'em. [Laughing] Rick Rhoden, on the mound. [Muttering] He takes the curve. Here's the windup and the pitch. - [Screams] - [Man] Pick a prize. So they have these cars that you can actually drive... except they're on this rail, so you can't get off the road- - [Laughing] - You have a really big gob of mustard right- - What? - Mustard. - Where? - Right there. - Is it gone? - Well- Here. - That gone? - Yeah. ## [Big Band] Listen. Oh, the music? ## [Continues] Wanna dance? Dance? - We don't have to if you don't want to. - Okay. Okay. - All right. - Okay. - Are you cold? - Mm-mmm. - We could get some hot chocolate, you know. - Mm-mmm. You can wear my jacket if you want. - Come on. It'll be fun. - I'm scared. - What are you worried about? You're with me, right? - All right. You're on. # [Continues] Oh, I haven't done this in a long time. [Laughs] What were you like when you were younger? - Oh, well, I wasn't much different. - [Laughs] I believe that about you. I've been thinking about you a lot. It's crazy. In my car... lying in bed. I've just never gone out with someone like you. With all the other men, there was so much to hide. I feel like I can tell you anything. Susan? Susan? There's something I think I should tell you. What? ## [Continues] You want the light on? [Bell Dings] - Good morning. Hey, Brent! How are you? - Good morning! - Hi, everybody! - [Woman] Hi, Josh! Josh. My man! - [Woman] Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning, sir. - I'd like some coffee, please, Miss Patterson. But you don't drink coffee. And, uh, make it black. It was a dream, honey. Atlantic City was beautiful and Donald was so romantic- I know I'm late with this, but congratulations, Mrs. Hicks. Barbara, you are not going to believe this. Hold on. [All Laughing] You know, you two should come to Vermont. It is so pretty up there now. - We spent our anniversary there. - All you did was watch TV. - I popped popcorn too. - [Man] He likes that intellectual stuff. [Man #2] Anybody happen to see that great documentary about Columbus... on PBS the other night? - Mm-mmm. - [Woman] Uh, no. Was it good? - I had no idea he had a fourth ship. - Yeah. The Santa Cristina. - That's right. - He only had that on his second trip though. - You saw it too. - No. - But l-I used to... study, you know, the stuff, so- - Really? - Dad, I need some help with my alge- - Uh, not now, Adam. - Yeah, Dad, you said- - Adam, we have guests. He's had the roughest time with algebra. We've tried tutors, everything. - [Alex] Mom! - With algebra? I used to study that too. [Woman] Isn't that nice? [Josh] Okay, look. Forget all the X's and Y's stuff... 'cause that was invented by some teacher that hates kids. - All right. - Let's imagine that Larry Bird... - is gonna score 10 points in a quarter, okay? - Yeah, okay. - So how many points is he gonna score in the entire game? - That's easy- 40 points. - Exactly. That's algebra. - Righ- It is? Yeah. See? Okay, one quarter is to 10 points that he scores in a quarter... just as four- You're right. He's wonderful. - I know. - [Adam] Ohh! - For earned run averages, field goal percentages, whatever. - That's pretty cool. - [Man] I don't wanna hear it anymore. - [Beeping] - You constantly bring- What's home? - [Woman] This is my house. - What's home? Fine. It's your house, you pay for it. - [Line Ringing] [Rings] - [Woman] Billy, are you on the phone? - [Man] I'm doin' it. - [Woman] Hey, Billy, get off the phone. - [Man] Listen to your mother. - Mmm. - He's never done this before. - Kind of like a sweepstakes. - Get the art department on the phone. Get them! - Send out for some sandwiches. - Cajun or deli? Maybe next year, right? Next year. - You can do it. I know you can. - I cannot plan a whole line. Why? Nobody knows more about toys in this entire company than you. Susan, that means marketing and strategy and stuff. - All he wants is a proposal. - I can't- - You come up with the ideas, and I'll handle the marketing. - Excuse me. - But it- - Come on. It'll be neat. Oh, l- I don't know. - I don't have any ideas for new toys or anything. - You've got great ideas. Cute. Can you walk the dog? - Forget how to knock? - Oh, I'm sorry. [Chattering] [Girl] Hey! Hey, you guys! Wait up for me! "Department of Consumer Affairs"? Yeah, buddy! It came! - He gives too much homework. What'd you get on the test? - I got a "C." [Boys Chattering Continues] - Do you have, like, Sports Illustrated? - Sure. - Here. - Two and a quarter, kid. - Hey. I got it. - Oh, all right. Comic books. - Change. - Say, what's that one? - Trade. Yeah. - This one's got Billy in the coal mine. Think I've read this one. I'll trade you for X-Factor. It won't be like these, where you just follow the story along. You would actually make a whole different story appear just by pressing these buttons. An electronic comic book? That's amazing. Yeah, a living comic book. It's gonna be different every time. This is incredible. You're brilliant. If you liked one, you could see it over and over and over again. You're-You're wonderful. Do you really like it? - Really? - Really. [Both Laughing] - You think Mac'll like it? - I think he'll love it. We could do sports comic books, where, like, if he's going to steal second or something. We could have sports books- baseball, football. It would work for almost any sport there is- hockey! - Wh-What is it we're doing? - Huh? W-What's going on here? Well, you know, we're- Something wrong? - You don't like it? - No! No! It's- I mean, if it's an affair, that's one thing. But if it's - i-if it's s-something else- [Exhales] Not that we have to know right now. We don't. But if we think that it could turn into something else, well- How do you feel about all this? How do I feel about what? How do you- How do you f-feel about me? [Chuckles] What is that supposed to mean? [Susan Laughs] [Woman] Oh, no. I'm sorry. Mr. Baskin is still in conference. Yeah? Well, tell him I called again. Kopecki. K-O-P- E-K-E. Yes, I can spell, young man. Yeah, right. Well, tell him it's important. Good-bye. Each page would be made out of six panels. There will be 30 pages per electronic comic book, with a choice every two pages- No, choice every three pages. - But ours will also be in color. Did I say that? - Yes, Mr. Baskin. Ours- Did I say- I didn't say that right. Yes. Well, whatever. Anyway- [Beeping] - Do you have the list of story line options? - Maybe. - [Beeping] - Can I see them? - [Beeping] - Maybe. - What was that? That sound. - What? What? - [Chuckles] That. What are you doing? - [Beeping] - What is it? - Let me see your hand. - Did you make this? - No, Petey made it. Here. - What does it do? - Put your hand right there. Just put your hand right there. - Put your hand. Okay. Watch. - [Beeping] - Put your hand on it. - What does it do? - [Electronic Tones] - That's incredible. - That's great. - [Beeping Tones] - [Chuckles] - [Beeps] - I don't get how it works. - Well, you need another person for it to work. Although maybe it will work with a dog. I don't know. - [Beeping Stops] - All right. Let's get back to work. - [Yawning] - Do you want some coffee? Sure? Uh-huh. [Sniffles] # [Humming] - Susan. - Oh, hi. - You working late again? - Yeah. Well, we were just- - I get- got some coffee. - You know, you're looking good these days. - No. - Oh, yeah. You are. - Oh. - I'm happy for you. - Oh. - Happy for both of you. I really am. - Night. - Night, darlin'. [Ringing] - [Line Ringing] - [Man, Woman Arguing] [Man] It's your house? The deed's in my name. I don't care who you raised. Did you raise gerbils and dogs? My tone is plenty civil. My tone is plenty civil. Who's putting the food on your plate? - It's my house. - [Woman] It's my house. I keep the house. [Man] You keep sayin' that, but the deed's in my name. [Man] Well, Jenny was saying that there was a problem- [Woman] Hi. [Chattering Continues] - Well, Wednesday would be better than Thursday. - [Door Opens] - Mr. Baskin can't be- - [Josh] I have a key example right here. Where you been? I've been trying to reach you forever. - I'm in the middle of something, okay? - That's the list. - All you gotta do is call. - Can you give me a minute? - Yes. - What are you talking about? This is it. This is the list. - Would you come back at lunch? I'm busy right now- Hello? - Busy? - Billy! - Are you outta your mind? Jesus, Billy. Miss Patterson, get them on the phone- This is what we've been waiting for. I got work to do. Can't you understand that? I got a deadline to meet. God! - Who the fuck do you think you are? - Hey! Hey, you?re Josh Baskin! Remember? You broke your arm on my roof! You hid in my basement when Robert Tyson was about to rip your head off! You don't get it, do you? This is important! I'm your best friend. What's more important than that, huh? And I'm three months older than you are, asshole. [Muttering] Stupid stuff. Some friend. I don't need him. Stupid jacket. [Radio: Static] - Josh? - [Radio: Chatter] Josh! Oh. Hi, Mrs. Baskin. Hiya. I was just looking around in here. Hmm. - Your hair's getting longer. - I got it cut yesterday. Oh. He had a birthday. Yeah, l- I know. I got him this anyway. - Pete Rose. - Yeah. They have these special shops where they do that. You know, if you want, you can keep it until- until he- He'll be coming back real soon. Everything's gonna be okay. [Beeps] - "You are standing in the cavern of the evil wizard. - [Beeping] All around you are the carcasses of slain ice dwarfs. " - Melt wizard. - [Typing, Beeping] - [Beeps] - "What do you want to melt him with?" [Rhythmic Beeping] [Beeping Accelerates] [Typing] Throw thermal pod. [Bell Rings] - Race you to the corner! - No! - Why not? - [Bell Rings] - You always win. - I'll let you win. [Chattering] Spreading leaves! [Woman] Greg! Time for dinner! [Greg] Wait! Just five more minutes! Mrs. Kaplan, in just a little bit to your right. Your right. Your right. Mrs. Kaplan knows her right and her left. Isn't that great? Let's have some smiles. This is a joyous occasion. No, no, no, just- [Chattering] - Where are we going? - Where do you guys wanna go? [Boy] Thanks, mister! Got it. I got it. Got it. - Hit a couple more! - All right. Where you been? It's kind of late. Oh, I was-was out. - Out where? - [Exhales] Just... took a walk. Josh, what's wrong? What is it? I haven't told you something because I didn't think that you were gonna believe me. And even if you did believe me, I didn't think that you were gonna like me anymore, so- Oh, honey, come here. You can tell me anything. What? Susan, I'm not what you think I am. Uh, what do you mean? Before I met you, I was in Little League. Um, I was in Little League, and I rode my bike to school... and I played with my friends and hung out with them and- What are you- What are you talking about? I want to go home. I miss my family, Susan, and I want to go home. - Oh, my God. You're married. - No. - This was too good to be true. There had to be something. - Susan, I'm not married. - You're not? - No. - I'm a child. - What? I'm a child, Susan... and I'm - I'm not ready for all of this. Oh, that's fine. That is-That's just great. - You see, what happened- - No, I understand. " I'm not ready to make a commitment. - I'm not ready to accept the responsibility. " - No, you don't understand. - I'm 13 years old. - Oh, and who isn't? You think that there isn't a frightened kid inside of me too? No, I mean I really am 13. I went to bed one night and I was a kid, woke up the next morning, I was a grown-up. Oh, right. And yesterday I was a schoolgirl with pigtails. Why are you doing this, Josh? - There was this carnival in New Jersey. - Please. - I made a wish on a machine called the Zoltar machine. - Oh, stop it. It was a Zoltar machine. It had this bobbing head, and it looked like a devil. If you got a quarter in the devil's mouth, you could make a wish, and I did. So I made a wish to be big. That's what I'm trying to tell you. I changed into a grown-up, when I'm really just a kid. Fine, Josh, you're a kid. Look, I really don't know what it is that you're trying to tell me... but we have a very big presentation to give tomorrow... so I'm gonna get some sleep. [Door Slams] - [Line Ringing] - [Woman] Hello? Yeah, do you have a Zoltar machine? - Nope. Never heard of it. - Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Wait. I need a paper. Would you get me some gum? Thank you. - These are the notes, in case you want 'em. - Thank you. Well, should get the cards set up before everyone comes in. Okay. [Beeping] - [Line Ringing] - [Man] Hello? - Yeah, do you have a Zoltar machine? - Got one right here. - You do? - Yeah. Yeah! Yeah, thanks. That's great! Yeah! [Woman] MacMillan Toys. I'll transfer. [Bell Dings] [Door Opens] Right there. Sea Point Park, New York. Well? - [Intercom Buzzes] - Yes? [Miss Patterson] They're waiting for you, Mr. Baskin. - Thanks. - See you around. [Door Opens] There's this flat screen on the inside with, uh, with pictures on it... and you read it, and you have to make a choice of what the character's gonna do. - lf he's gonna fight the dragon, you push one of the buttons- - Uh- - Paul? - I don't get it. - Well- - [Man] Paul, stop it. [Josh] It's a comic book that- See, there's a computer chip inside which stores the choices. So, when you reach the end of the page, you decide where the story goes. - That's the point. - Terrific, Susan. [Susan] The kid makes his own decision. - [MacMillan] This is really possible? - Yeah. In fact, it's a very simple program. Isn't that right? [Man] So what happens when you run out of choices? [Susan] That's the great thing. You can just sell different adventures. Just pop in a brand-new disk, and you get a whole new set of options. - We could market this on a comic book rack. - [Susan] Mm-hmm. - I'll be right back. - [MacMillan] How much would the unit cost? Our initial figure is around seven- [Door Closes] Around seven dollars... with a retail cost of about $18.95. You expect a kid to pay $ 19 for a comic book? I think a kid- Will you excuse me? - What's going on? - [MacMillan] Let 'em be. [Door Slams] Josh? Josh? [Grunts] Oh. [Whistles] - More. - [Josh] Will you take me to Sea Point Park, New York? - [Cab Driver] Get in. - Sea Point Park? Josh! - Hey! Not so fast! - Sorry. Here. Josh! Josh! See you back home! Yeah! - Excuse me. Do you know him? You know Josh? - Yeah. Yeah. - Look, you have to tell me where he went. - Who are you? I'm- I'm his girlfriend. Ew. [Chuckles] - Billy Kopecki. - You have to tell me where he went. Where did he go? Please tell me. Tell me! [Gulls Squawking] It's tough to find a cab out here. Thanks. - Work, damn it! - [Bell Dings] [Bell Dings] I wish I was a kid again. [Machine Whirring, Clanking] - Josh? - Susan. You know, you don't walk out on somebody. You don't just get up and leave and- and- and walk out like that. - You don't do that. - I know. I know. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry, but I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to say. [Machine Clanking] Oh, God. You got your wish. - I tried to tell you. - I didn't listen. - I guess I didn't hear you, or- or want to, or- - I tried to tell you last night. - How would I have- Even if I did listen, how would I know? - I've been thinking about this. - Why would I know that? - I've been trying- I've been thinking about it, and there's a million reasons for me to go home... but there's only one reason for me to stay. What-What reason is that? Well, you. Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. So, uh, what- what are you, 15, 16? I'm- I'm 13. [Groans] Mm-hmm. Well, that explains it. Maybe you could come with me. No. [Chuckles, Sniffs] - No, l- - Why not? I've- I've been there before. [Chuckles] [Sniffles] It's hard enough the first time. You know what I mean? You don't know what I mean. Come on. I'll drive you home. - I'm sorry. - No, I'll be okay. You'll be fine. Ten years, who knows? Maybe you should hold on to my number. So this is where you live. - Which one is it? - The one right there. [Susan] Oh. It's nice. [Sighs] I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. - You won't even remember me. - Oh, yes, I will. [Sighs] [Footsteps] [Whispers] Bye. [Footsteps] Ma? - Ma, it's me. - [Mrs. Baskin]Josh? [Mrs. Baskin] Josh? Josh! Oh, my God! Oh, thank God you're home! [Josh] Oh, Ma, I missed you all so much. - I'm just not good enough. - What are you talking about? You've been hitting the ball over the fence almost every time in stickball. You just gotta get used to a fatter bat. [Both Chuckling] - You really think I could do it? - Yeah. Come on. We'll hit some after supper. Okay, I'll call for you.
