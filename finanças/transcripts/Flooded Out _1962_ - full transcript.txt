I am Dolores Gaitan, better known as Don Dolorcito. It's summer. It's 6:30 in the morning, and it rains in Boca Del Tigre. This is the story of my family, of my wife, Optima, and my children. It is also the story of my friend Funes. And of Don Marlin Orellano, founder of the neighborhood. And of Casal, and of Zabala, the fisherman, and Busto. It's the story of hundreds of families in Santa Fe, hundreds of Argentines. When this film is over, all of us will return to our flooded, muddy homes, where the filmmakers sought us out to make this film. As I said before, I will share my story, and while my language may not be flowery, it is sincere. THE FLOODED Take the pigs to their pens! Dolorcito! Dolorcito! Look! I told you. Good heavens! Pilar! Mario! Conito! Come, children! Hurry up! I told you. I told you so. You are so thickheaded. It's no big deal. - It's always the same with you. - Hurry, Boss. Hurry! Let's go! Move! It's always the same with you! How are you today, chief? Orellano! How will we sell these rags to the newspaper before 4:00? Leave that alone! I have to keep watch over everything. And your father just sits there. Mario! Conito! Good for nothing kids! C'mon, dad. Let's go. Be quiet you snot-nosed kid! We're not going anywhere! Do you think I'm that stupid? There they come! It's a godsend! There's no need to shoot your mouth off just for the sake of it. Come here, son. It's a godsend. Are you sick? I was up until 2 a.m. laying down bags, waist high in water. Pilar, hand me that pot. Hey, brat! Pee on the floor! Watch it! Move out of the way! Me first, sir! My legs can't take it any longer. You'll get a hernia, my friend! I want to die here. Not me! The government is obligated to provide for us, isn't it? Are we or are we not Argentines? Brother! Wait for me! "Cleaning Service" Against the high cost of living, against the potholes in the streets! Against government inefficiency and bureaucratic waste! Vote! Honesty and integrity! Vote for councilman... Guys, we have to push. Vote our candidate... Dr. Benitez. "Closed to traffic, from 6:30 to 9:00 p.m." You can't go. Traffic is closed. - This is official business. - Ha! What traffic? Fine, go ahead. Long live Colon! Long live Colon! Colon! Colon! Is this how you take care of your siblings, you snot? - They're helping Funes with the fire. - Oh really! "I don't know why, I don't know why I fell in love with you..." "...Without even knowing you..." Keep an eye on the milk, Dad. This is all very nice, but we don't even have money to buy food. Well, if they brought us here, they won't let us starve, right? Jeez! Don't play the fool, Dolores. Last night you drank away the last of our money. So what? Are we flooded or not? What is it? What letter does it begin with? - Do you want to be my girlfriend? - Yes... If you want to be my girlfriend, first... you know. - Pig! - Pilar... hey, Pilar! Leave me alone. I'm telling mom! Ooh, stud... Are you done? Quit goofing off, you. Do the plants still need to be watered? When you're done, take down the laundry, and mend any of Don Cocho's socks that still have holes. Miss Zoraida, I'm leaving! Okay, dear. Miss Zoraida, with this mess we're in... Wait a minute while I finish with these flowers. If you could pay us a little in advance... This afternoon we start the novena for Uncle Fito. Grandfather Fito. I want Pilar to decorate the altar with them. Look, Optima. This is what Zoraida was talking about: "Flooded in the Central Zone." Mr. Editor: As I observe the settlement of train wagons that house the flooded next to the post office, I ask myself - Optima... - Coming! if there was no other refuge for those poor people, that we should have to witness such misery up close. - Optima, come here. - Coming, Miss. leaving to we taxpayers the burden... Take this for Dolores. I gave it to Cocho for our silver anniversary. Thank you, Miss Zoraida. We're barely scraping along. I'm sorry, but Cocho doesn't receive his pension until the 27th. You know God will provide. It fits perfectly, Dad! This will only get me made fun of. I wasn't born to be laughed at. Take a photo! Enjoy your dinner. It's a little cold, but it's still good. Madam, how has it been living in the city center? What can I tell you? I don't even know how to read. Sad to think some want this to end. End? You're mistaken, this has only just started. - It was in "The Liberal". - "The Liberal"? Ha! Look, sir, these people were born to live on the banks. We're like scabies here. Gentlemen, that paper is playing the government's game. It pretends to be neutral, but it's shaping public opinion to get rid of all of you. Our paper, "Progress" won't allow it. - Is the picture for "The Liberal"? - No. Take a picture of everyone! Remember, whatever happens, the solution is Benitez! Optima, a souvenir! It's free! The Flood. Hunger and Grief. The Government Blind and Deaf. Dr. Canudas, come join us. Benitez, councilman. Vote Popular Action! There's a lot of blank votes, no? Canudas, come in! Find a way to fix it then. - How is it going? - With the food or us? What a sense of humor, Gaitan! This year we'll steal the elections. We must let everyone know the first thing we'll do in office is construct a new dam. That's what we want. Funes and I wanted to speak with Dr. Benitez. Ohm he's like a son to me. So what's all this talk that they want to evict us from here? Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. Have a bite. Hello. As subsecretary to the Minister of Hygiene and Social Welfare, I will be brief. The government is not blind, nor deaf, nor dumb. Despite the fact this is a long standing problem, we will do all that we can so that all of you will have a dam before the next flood. Seems to me these guys are looking for votes in the next election. Mr. Strozzo will say a few words on behalf of the organizers of the Solidarity Conference. How much longer... Ladies and Gentlemen, we ask ourselves what can we do to mitigate the disgrace fallen upon you. What can we do to comply with our social conscience as good citizens of this nation? I wonder who wrote that for him? In solidarity with you, the flooded, I have here the outcome of the individual man's response to the common need... Ugh, it's hot. Sit over there. It's only noon. This is going to take awhile. These socks, these blankets, these shirts, this sugar, this tea... To me! To me! Gentlemen, please! Form a line. Please, miss, make a list of every family member, daughters, sons, the ages of each, health status... They should give them fruit cakes and champagne! I didn't get anything. Here, I'll be right back. Hey! You're such a... Want it? Come here. Give it to me, give it to me! Go barefoot for all I care. Ow! C'mon, give it here! No, no, nooo! Out! Get out! Dogs of the devil! - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Fancy seeing you here, Miss Zoraida. Ugh, what filthy dogs. I decided to go for a ride... Mario, bring the lady a glass of water. I decided to go for a ride and come by to see why Pilar hadn't come today. Pilar? What day is today? Tuesday, no? Of course! She went to Don Goyo's butcher shop who sells on credit... At least until Gaitan makes some headway with his politics. Mom, look! What's his name? That's my little boy. He's Juan Domingo. - What a cutie. - He is, isn't he? This woman is looking for a serious maid. Do you know any? One with references. Can't just let anyone in your home these days. Don't let Pilar get away with this. Once these girls hit the streets... they start having babies and get lazy. "I'm such a changed man, my God. I don't know who I am anymore." Shameless! "Don't you see I'm lost, my heart is beaten and dizzy..." I'm going to kill myself! I'm going to kill myself! For the construction of drainpipes, the solution is Benitez! No more darkness in public plazas, vote Benitez! The flooded evicted from the port! Read "Progress"! The cat is out of the bag! The flooded evicted from the port! A little something for the flooded... A little something for the flooded... - A little something for the flooded? - Please, miss, I already gave twice! - Look at that cutie over there! - Which one? Why don't you go to the other side, maybe we can collect more. Fine by me. Look at those Italian shoes! I just love them! Oh Marta, how can you like those? Hot off the presses! The flooded are evicted from the port! Are the wagons a necessary solution, or is the government trying to cover up some underhanded business two days from the election? Something smells fishy... The flooded evicted from the port! Hot off the presses! "Progress!" Get your "Progress" here! - A little something... - Good grief, woman! Remember to vote on November 26. Long live Santa Fe! Look here. We want to see Dr. Benitez since your paper... You people oppose Officialism because there's truth in it. We're not looking for trouble, but we have nowhere else to go. - I'm listening. Take that. - Ok, chief. Seeing Dr. Benitez two days before the election won't be easy. What's the problem? Take away six, add four, problem solved. Agreed? Where were we? Excuse me, but you are too busy. Gentlemen, let's go. Gentlemen, don't even think about it. Where's my assistant? - Chief. - Get me Dr. Benitez on the line. Vote for pavements, for sewers, for transportation, for lighting! Long live Santa Fe! Dr. Benitez's secretary is on the phone. Hello friend! How are you? We're going to win the elections! I have some people here who were flooded. They'd like to see Dr. Benitez. I expected nothing less of you. Thank you! Thanks again. He's such a liar. He didn't speak with Benitez. You don't trust anyone, do you? If tomorrow... That guy always took bribes. Hey Gaitan, what if we go see that lawyer friend of yours? Well... So your friend really can't help us. Gentlemen, to gain something we have to risk everything. Yeah! Let's go. At your service, Gaitan. Doctor, these are some fellow party members worried about... Look, we've had it up to here with them trying to evict us! Not another word! We'll resort to collective recourse "pro tempore litis." Chiche's godfather, who's a soldier, told me they're getting ready to put us up over by the Second Precinct. But what we want is to see Dr. Benitez! Especially now, with this bunch of do-nothings. They won't put us in jail! We want something done now! It's noon. Maybe Dr. Benitez is headed over to the courthouse. Let's go! Vote Democratic Populism! Vote for your future councilmen Del Solar, Perelli, and Sanguinetti! One government, one party, one administration! Councilman Benitez! Vote Popular Action! Against the high cost of living, Long live Santa Fe! Vote pavements, vote sewers. The solution is Benitez. Popular Action! Long live Santa Fe! The solution is Benitez! The solution is Benitez! - Councilman Benitez! - Thank you, but not yet! He's unstoppable until he reaches the presidency! Permit number 22311 for the turbine import was just approved. That's great, friend. Doctor, Doctor Benitez... Doctor Benitez, if I could have a word with you. I've come with party sympathizers and my friend, Gaitan. - They are some of the flooded. - Yes, I'm aware. - Now, regarding their eviction... - There won't be any eviction! The day after tomorrow we will run the government, and for you, who have been cheated time and time again, we'll go straight to the heart of the matter. We'll build a dam, fill in the ditch, and hand over the land to its residents. Rest assured. We split them in the west, man! We're 121 votes ahead! From the second precinct. Popular Action: 125... - Aren't we going to take it? - Let's go! Onward Populists... Look forward and don't stop. The May and June sun will shine upon us... Onward Populists... Look forward and don't stop. The May and June sun will shine upon us. No, we won't score anything here. What a pity. Not even a drop of wine to get us a little tipsy. My mouth is bitter from so much gunpowder. Nice government we're in for. Dear listeners... Hey, Hugo, why don't you stop goofing off and sing something? The Parana River roars, growing day and night. The Parana will wash away the ranches, cabins, and trunks. My home has been flooded, the cotton tree no longer blossoms, The yeruti tree wept that sad afternoon I left. Floating along the river, the canoe is loaded, Nets, traps, tackle, my fishing boat's oars... The water roars and I was left poor. Without a home, without a blanket. But they won't take me from my birthplace. Fighting against the current to live. The sky is clearing, the crested screamers fly, the larks sing, And the day will come that I return to Santa Fe. Floating along the river, the canoe is loaded. Nets, traps, tackle, my fishing boat's oars... And now for a chamame! Play a chamame! At the request of the public... Maestro. Results from the first vote count... 8 tables in the second precinct. Are you up for a spin, Optima? As if this were a time for dancing. If this keeps up, we'll be dancing for our dinner. You know it's been more than five days since anyone has seen him. Get out, move! Move! Stop pestering! Go ahead, I'll be right there. - Would you like to dance? - No thank you. Hey, wait for me! Hey! Stop. Why haven't you come by all these days? It's been five days since you fell off the map. Let it go. If I don't send out a search party, I'd never see you again. - Get off! - Hey... come on. God protect me. Hey, Raul! Blow it out, for a kiss. The music stopped. I pay. That's why I'm Garrido the Chilean, and no one disrespects me. Keep playing music! Nothing happened! Keep dancing! This is for the women! For the women! Excuse me! Good night. What a pity your legs can't take it anymore, eh old man? Cheer up. You can't walk around with a long face all the time. Let's dance. Alone! Leave them alone! Leave them alone! In the last 24 hours the Parana River rose 4 millimeters in the port. However, in the northern ports, the tide has fallen. So now what? Old man, the tide will decrease soon enough, you'll see. Animal! Be careful! Did you just wake up? I've been drinking mate since 5 a.m. Who can sleep with all this misery? We came to offer you some work unloading these boxes. You could earn a few dollars. Today I can't. Besides, I'm one of the flooded. Did you know? It's a bit cold, daughter. They don't care about anything, not the country, nothing! Everything is worse here. You can only see the rooftops of the shacks. Don't worry, friend. After this last flood the tide will bring in all the fish, and then we'll have plenty of time to sit back and relax. Let's go. Hurry up! Ruiz! Gramaglia! Start from the other side. Where are you taking us? Over to the second precinct. As if we were criminals! You're not being taken in as criminals. No, just as guests. I'm just following orders. We have to get out of here and that's that. Break it up, break it up. Cecilia! Get everything ready, we're leaving. They're pigs! Is anyone here? - My husband isn't home. - So? He's the owner of the house. Stop this nonsense. Orders are for everyone! I don't know, sir. Robirosa, Mingo... Here! Open up! Open up, I say! Excuse me, officer. I'm sorry, but I can't accompany you. Don Canudas, the attorney... Attorney? What attorney? As if! Hey, looks like you're going to take a nap. Excuse me? ...large apartments, office space, retail space, central heating... ...four elevators, freight elevators, air conditioning in all rooms... Fixed prices! We're waiting for you. You too can be part of a cooperative. For more information about our generous financing plans... I found Dr. Canudas. I've been all over... the city, the courthouses... From there they sent me to some bar. I will immediately file a complaint for abuse of authority. - The authorities are the authority! - But the law gives you your authority. Yes, but the resolution of the Traffic Authority... There are no "buts" sir! Go wrap up half a dozen eggs for Dr. Canudas. - Are they duck eggs? - No, of course not. Dura Lex sed Lex! Law 41.108, article 15, subsection N... Underpants... fifteen... Sundresses... two... Do you want to make one smaller for yourself? To show off in front of who? Enough already. You also have to appear in court tomorrow. Dr. Canudas said everyone has to go. "If you don't behave tomorrow they'll force you out." I don't know about this Dr. Canudas. Undershirts... Tomorrow he's going to make me waste the entire morning... ...Four for adults, used, half a dozen small... new. Look at this cute jumper for the baby! I don't see what the fuss is about. Dolores! Gaitan! Old man! Old man! Pilar! Mario! Conito! Pilar! Children! Children! I've known you for nineteen years! Thickheaded! Thickheaded is what you are! Just our luck! You and that shyster friend of yours! That Canudas is a liar! This is the end of the world! Come here. Move away from there. Where are we? Are we going to Buenos Aires, Dad? To think that now we could be with everyone else in the Second Precinct. "Be kind to animals." Hello Santa Fe! Laguna here. Hello. Fine, I'll hold. Tell me, what's your name? I'm Dolores Gaitan. At your service. Hello, Mr. Moscardo? He's not in? Okay, listen then... Train number 206 has arrived with a wagon full of flooded. No, f-l-o-o-d-e-d. Excuse me? How do I know? You just found out that all these people were on the train? I'm just following orders and that's that. Fine, but this train is here... Louder? Yes! This train doesn't exist? What do you mean? Oh, on record you mean. But it does exist then. Oh, it doesn't exist? Listen. Listen. Listen! Bye! Bye! Go on, keep moving. Just a little more. Keep on 'til the next station. - What are those? - They're for Salemne, the Turk. Good day, sir. We're the people who were flooded in Santa Fe. Which way do we go? And with the children, to top it all off. Disciplinary proceedings have been issued. Are you convinced? This says so right there. Rest assured that sooner or later those responsible will be caught! It can't be! We're in Calchaqui. In Galchaqui! You can lake your entire family back to Santa Fe. Ride's over. Yes, I did it! I unhooked the wagon, now it's out of my hands. Now it's really going to get ugly for you and for them. - Jose! - Coming! Jose! Good afternoon, friends. I have extraordinary news: Santa Fe, Republic of Argentina. Believe it or not. In some part of Santa Fe, Argentina, a runaway train. Dolores Gaitan, a Santa Fe resident, native of the Boca Del Tigre region, was mistakenly attached to a cargo train leaving the local port. The family has been wandering around the province with no final destination. The actual whereabouts of the family is unknown. - Hello. - Hello. So then he says: "It will be noted your service record." That's logical. I deserve it. I earned it. So I asked him, "But how much longer do these poor people have to suffer?" - It's okay, chief. - You did what you could. - This is death. - That's what I said. "This is death!" And do you know what he said to me? "Death or not, that train has to reach the station" "while the disciplinary proceedings continue." Bye! Bye! "How can we expect that train to run when everyone does what he pleases?" "God, what's happened to me?" "I'm so changed, I don't know who I am anymore." Hey, what are you doing? Come over here and help me! Well, what's going on? Good God! They're idiots! They just telephoned to say the case is delayed, the Gaitan inquiry won't continue for another few days. Everyone must stay here. New orders! Thank you. They get everything for free while one works like a slave all day. Please, help yourself. - Help yourself. Have one. - Go ahead. Thank you. Help yourself. - Judge. - Commissioner. - You keep it. - Okay. "You were very unfair with me, Raul." "I can't stand this suffering anymore." "What's happening to me is all your fault." What a gown! How lucky! I can't believe I'm sitting here with nothing to do. As if I were to never move from here again! "The bride, Moniga Dougall, arrives at the temple on the arm of her father" "the ambassador, Don Manuel Marta de Lorrainz y Pombo." Did you borrow it from the chief's wife? Children! "In the Chinese section we find a traditional lace and pearl fan..." Hopefully you'll find a good man. Here comes the train! I can't believe it! Gaitan - Tagliabue won the local bowling championship, 12 to 15! Dolorcitos champion! In the capital, in a match against Dr. Benitez... Take that to your mother before it gets cold and tell her I'll be right there. A round on Ripamonti in honor of the champs! How embarrassing! An outsider beat us! But Gaitan isn't an outsider to us anymore. Regardless, one of these days... Goodbye! That train is bogged down somewhere and we don't know where. Don't worry. The station chief has been after me for two weeks. Maybe the train leaves today... be ready... don't go anywhere... ...the train is coming... as if I were such a sucker! No one remembers you. Let's go! Let's go! Move it! Wait a minute. Miss Pilar Gaitan, is that you? Sender: "Raul Vera, Gobernador Freyre 374, Santa Fe." No! Leave man, go! "I can't live without you. I've been a liar, but I swear that I only love you." "A kiss on your cheek, your Raul." Today at 9 o'clock the extraordinary dance organized by... There's the train! - The boss' wife sends it, Mom. - Put it there. Now we'll have to eat the cold cuts after the ravioli. You're going out to party too? How much will they pay per bag? 70 pesos. And you can gather up to 10 bags per day. I'm going to pee. Look at the stars. Leave the dishes for later. They're green. They look like they're on fire. My grandfather, may he rest in peace, always told me the Southern Cross... Which is it, Dad? Which is it, Dad? Ooh! A star just fell... Make a wish. - Here is the Gaitan case file, sir. - Finally! The file is here! The file is here! What a coincidence, I bring them and I take them. You know how to read? "Restitution... wagon... flooded... Gaitan..." - See? Did you see? - No! I told you! I told you so! Let's go, let's go! Pilar! Conito! Mario! Miss Marianita! We're going! Conito, tell your father to come immediately. Dad! Hey Dad! Come here! Mom said the chief said the train is leaving! Get out of here! And tell the chief your father said he and his train can go... What about our father? Is he coming or not? Move! For the love of God, wait another minute. I'm not waiting anymore. Not a second longer. - Was he there? - What did he say? - Speak up! What did he say? - Did the cat catch your tongue? Answer! My father said you and your train can go to hell. No, no, no. Go on, chief. I'll take them. Dolorcito! Dad! Dad! Daddy! Run! It all seems like a dream. In the end, we're getting to see the world in our old age. Life is so unfair. This country sure is big! And it has everything. Sometimes I wonder who is responsible for everything. Us, destiny... The government! They're all the same. Nothing but empty promises. And to think I've never been further than the Salado River. Finally it's our turn, no? One ends up complaining over nothing after all. As you can see, this place is a dump. Don Orellano was right, we're all Argentines. But some people think we're idiots and we can't allow that any longer. - Good day. - Good day. Look at this bone. Tell her to rinse it off and throw it in the pot. How was your trip? Fine. Did you miss me? A lot. What a shame! And we were wondering where you'd disappeared to. Cacique Aracaiquin... Calchaqui... who knows? At least we're back home now. - Do you want a cigarette? - Sure. Goodbye gentlemen! It doesn't seem real. It's my house. It's everything. I've been here all my life. What can I say, Don Orellano? I won't leave. I'm not being pretentious, I don't know what's wrong with me. - Good bye. - Bye. That was the good life. Who knows when the next flood will be!
