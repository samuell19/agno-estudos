Perugia Police Department. The address is 7 Via della Pergola. Marco, listen. Do you understand there's a dead girl here? The request is from Amanda. Amanda Knox. Bra. They covered her. Shit. Shit. There are those who believe in my innocence. And there are those who believe in my guilt. There's no in between. And if I'm guilty... it means that I am the ultimate figure to fear. Because I'm not the obvious one. But on the other hand, if I'm innocent, it means that everyone's vulnerable. And that's everyone's nightmare. Either I'm a psychopath in sheep's clothing, or I am you. You can see that this does not look like grief, does not read as grief. I think everyone's reaction to something horrible is different. Your roommates, your boyfriend, the cops, they all say the same thing. They thought you were responding weird. Odd. Strange. What makes you strange? If you google the name "Amanda Knox," you get 7.1 million hits. You all know better than anybody that hundreds of thousands of those are not kind. "She-devil with an angel face. Heartless manipulator. Concertante of sex." Were you into deviant sex? Insensitive question, but, hey, we gotta get to what it is. This fuels the doubt. Did you have any type of experimental activities there you're embarrassed to talk about? Did you kill Meredith Kercher? No. -Were you there that night? -No. Do you know anything you have not told police? -Do you know anything? -No. Before Italy, I had a happy life. All right, Amanda. Are you excited to see David? David? David? David, the statue of David. Oh. - God damn. - Good one. I was quirky and I was okay with that. And I was ridiculous and I was okay with that. I thought of myself as, like, a warrior princess. I'm like Xena! I remember thinking, "Okay, I'm different. I'm my own person, but I'm gonna find my place." Yeah, I know, I know. I know. Going into college, I felt a little behind. - One shot. One shot, Amanda. - Don't you dare. - It was one and a half, okay? - It was one shot. One and a half. I didn't depend on myself much. And I felt like it was very important for me to get out of my comfort zone and see if that made me turn into an adult. Italy has so much history. Ruins, art, vineyards. And I thought, "I will find myself in this new place." So are you excited to go live in Italy? Fuckin' yeah, bitch. Those first weeks, I was discovering what the city was. I was living with these Italian women and a British girl my age, who was super sophisticated. And we had this beautiful house that overlooked this valley, like, I was owning it. I was expecting that I was going to be part of this scholarly program. And it was zero work. And so I thought, "Okay, I might as well get a job." Patrick Lumumba was trying to get his bar off the ground. And he hired me hoping it would bring in customers. I swear to God, I don't know what it is about people who think that guys are not attractive physically, but... In Seattle, I was cute. In Italy, I was the beautiful, blonde American girl. That, I had never been before. I went to a classical music concert and there was this girl alone. She was very, very pretty. When I looked at her, she looked at me back. I was so shy that even if she looked at me, she smiled at me, I was turning back and said, "Is she looking at somebody in my back?" It was not. It was me. So after I realized it, I said, "Why not talking?" He immediately recognized from my accent that I was American or spoke English and so he started speaking to me in English, because he can. Um, or at least, kinda. I showed her a beautiful panorama of Perugia, which, for me, was very romantic, and... I had my heart beating so fast, like... You know, like, "Oh, there's the romance now." And... I kissed her. Compared to so many other guys who were just automatically, like, "Hey, baby." Like, he was super nice and I was completely charmed. And... yeah. Well, we went to home. I started to smoke, to try to prepare a joint or something like that, but then we thought about something different. And the night closed with a happy ending. I had never been in love before. From there on out, like as soon as I got out of class, we were going on walks together, and getting pizza, and going to the outdoor market. And he wanted to get me a perfume, because all Italian ladies have perfumes. It was just a week, but we spent every single day with each other taking pictures... smoking pot... and making love. Good evening from the Umbria TV news, which opens with sad news. Meredith Kercher, an English 22-year-old, was found dead in her house on Via della Pergola. Everything discovered so far suggests she's been murdered. The crime scene. It's a memory that will always be with me. There was blood everywhere. The girl's naked body had been covered. There were signs that she'd been violently held down. Mostly on her arms. Her throat had an extremely deep wound. It struck me because of how deep it was. I asked, "Is a monster responsible for this?" Outside, I saw two young people. They were comforting each other with an affection inappropriate for the moment. Make sure to shoot the body bag if it comes out. Enough, please stop it. As a courtesy, please stop! Have some dignity. A murder always gets people going. Bit of intrigue. Bit of mystery. A whodunit. And we have here this beautiful, picturesque hilltop town in the middle of Italy. It was a particularly gruesome murder. Throat slit, semi-naked, blood everywhere. I mean... what more do you want in a story? I mean, all you're missing is maybe, I don't know, the Royal Family and the Pope or something like that as well. This was the first time I'd ever covered a case in Perugia. So obviously the first thing you need to do is get to the main players. 'Cause obviously to get the facts, you've gotta be on the scene, really. You've gotta be Johnny-on-the-spot. The authorities in Perugia were under an intense amount of pressure. As we say in Italy, there's this phrase, "bella figura," a beautiful figure, a beautiful impression. Keeping up appearances. They found themselves on the international media map and they just wanted to show that they were capable of dealing with something of this... of this scale. Nothing can prepare you for the news we received on Friday evening. Words can't even describe how we feel right now other than utterly devastated at the tragic loss of our daughter and sister Meredith. We feel it's no exaggeration to say that Meredith touched the lives of everyone she met with her infectious, upbeat personality, smile, and sense of humor. We loved Meredith then. We love her still. And she's still very much a part of our family forever. Meredith's mother came. And she asked to see her daughter. And I remember she was absorbed in silence. And then she made a gesture. She asked if she could give her a kiss. I have a family, I'm the father of four girls. Therefore, I understood her immense pain. I am Catholic. So I believe in two things that are hard to reconcile. That God runs the world. But also that man has free will... and must be held responsible for their actions. Investigators are working around the clock to figure out the motive, people she knew, and possible romantic relationships. Investigators are not ruling out any motive. Tomorrow, they'll do the autopsy. The whole place was just awash with journalists. So any nugget, any scrap, anything new, you were just trying to get it out ahead of your competitor. We were all camped outside the mortuary waiting for the pathologist to come out. I spoke good Italian and I think also they liked the fact that, "Wow, I've got a British journalist talking to me. I'm now a big star as well." And I was allowed to come report the facts. The post-mortem concluded that there had been some sort of sexual interference with Meredith's body. Traces of male DNA in her body. And I remember him telling me that there were also little nicks in her chin, as if someone had been taunting her, sort of torturing her. That's when the police and the prosecution started saying that it was a group crime. A sex game gone wrong. And we managed to get it out to the British press before anyone else. And that was the scoop that we had, and it made headlines all over the world. To see your name on the front page with a great story that everyone's talking about... it's just a fantastic buzz. I mean, I'd like to say it's like having sex or something like that. You know? Meredith was my friend of a few weeks. We weren't lifetime best friends. But I was so shocked by what happened to her. It made no sense. It was brutal. And it could've happened to me. But I was at Raffaele's apartment the night of the murder. We watched Amélie, and in the middle of watching Amélie, I got a text message from Patrick saying that I didn't have to come into work, and I was like, "Yes!" We finished watching the movie. We made dinner. And I read to him from a German Harry Potter book. And after that we just hung out on his bed and talked and made goofy faces at each other. And eventually that turned into kissing which turned into the making love and then passing out. The next morning, I wake up, I told him that I was gonna go back to my place. So I went there. Um, I just walked down. And the first thing that I saw was that my front door was already open. The common area was normal. My room was normal, normal messy, but normal. And I got undressed and I walked into the bathroom. And I noticed that there was some drops of blood in the sink. But... I mean, there were just a few drops of blood. Whatever. Um... I brushed my teeth. And then I took a shower. When I stepped out of the shower onto the bath mat, that's when I noticed the larger splotch of blood on the bath mat. But there's only some spots of blood and then that, so maybe someone cut themselves, something like that. It was right after I was done blow-drying my hair that I just happened to look over into the toilet and saw that feces had been left there. That gave me the creeps. Like, all of a sudden I got this creepy feeling like someone was in the house with me. And I was just like, "Oh, shit." So, I went to Raffaele and I talked to him about it. I went back there. I saw all this mess. It was very weird. And I was a little bit surprised that she took a shower inside her house without having the anxiety of it. We tried Meredith's room and the door was locked, which was very strange. And so I knocked gently and called for Meredith. And then I knocked louder and I called for Meredith. And finally I was like, "Raffaele, can you please, like, try to break open this door? I don't know if Meredith's in there or not." And he tried kicking it down twice, but it didn't work. Hello, good morning, listen... someone made a mess and there is a door closed. And there are also blood marks in the bathroom. Which door is closed? One of the roommates. We don't know where she is. I am sending a police car so that we can inspect the situation. The police, like, kicked us all out of the house. Kicked down Meredith's door. And they were saying that her... Like, there was blood everywhere and that her throat had been slit and... And so that's how I was told that Meredith was dead. I have always had a great passion for investigating. I like detective movies a lot. Sherlock Holmes, for example. He was able to get clues from seemingly insignificant events. Why was the girl covered with the blanket? A woman who has killed tends to cover the body of female victims. A man would never think to do this. The thing that struck me the most was the break-in. Nothing had been stolen. And there was no evidence that someone had climbed the wall. Immediately, I could tell it was a staged break-in. It could have no other function than this, throw off suspicion from someone who has a connection to the house. The next day, they brought me back to my place. It was the first time I was back in my apartment after it had been closed off as a crime scene. And they were having me go through the knife drawer to see if any of the knives were missing. So basically they were asking me to see if there was the murder weapon missing from this drawer. And it just all hit me all at once, and I became hysterical. She started hitting the palms of her hands on her ears. As if there was the memory of a noise, a sound, a scream. Meredith's scream. Undoubtedly, I started to suspect Amanda. Pronto. Amanda, it's Brett. What are you doing? I'm just about to head home from one of Raffaele's friend's places. So, is Raffaele, like, your, like, boyfriend? Yeah. He's super hot? I'll send you a picture. Do it now. Do it now. Amanda, I miss you so much. Yeah, I know... I had a really bad day today. Fuck, man. Like, being in the police station, I'm incredibly nervous, and I always feel like I'm about to burst into crying, 'cause I'm just, like, so upset, but, um... Like, I feel good now talking to you. Oh, honey... Don't worry about it. Remember, when that happens, go, "Wait. I'm in Italy and I'm with Raffaele. And I'm 20, and I'm gonna look back on this year as, like, the best year of my life." The night of the 5th, we had a breakthrough in the investigation. Sollecito is called into the police station. Amanda was not called in, but she follows him anyway. She was waiting in the corridor of the police station, and they were starting to be very rude to me and asking me questions about, um... "What happened that night?" That night, I know that I was in my apartment. I know that I spent the night with Amanda. I know she slept with me. But they were not satisfied. And they were pushing, and aggressive, and they became the worst of the worst. This policeman told me that Amanda lied all the time, she was a stupid slut, a cow, that didn't care about me. "Your situation is very, very bad." After a long time... the reality around you turns to twist and don't be so clear. Then Sollecito changes his version of the events. He turned his back on Amanda. He says, "So far I've told a bunch of lies, because she told me to say them. The truth is I was home that night. Amanda wasn't with me and didn't come back until 1:00 a.m." Let's put ourselves in Amanda's shoes. You go to the police station with your boyfriend. You are in a different room and don't know what he's saying. Then at a certain point they come to tell you, "Your boyfriend... he's turned on you." They wanted to prove that I had left. And they wanted my cell phone. And I was like, "Yes, just look at my cell phone. Like, I did not leave. I didn't have to work that night. I was supposed to work, but I didn't go to work. I didn't leave." They fiddled through it and pulled up this text message that I had sent to Patrick, which said... Which, literally, word-for-word is, "We will see each other later. Have a good night." I told them, like, he sent me this text message saying, "Don't come in to work." And so I said, "Okay, see you later then. Have a good night." And they said, "No, what this literally means is you are going to see someone. You made an appointment with someone, and you don't remember. Clearly, your mind is fucked. And you're going to be either on our side, or you're gonna be on the murderer's side. And what side are you on?" I got so frazzled by it, I said, "I don't know what the fuck is going on." And another of the guys was like, "'Fuck!' I understand 'fuck.' Fuck you!" And he thought that I was yelling "Fuck you" at him. And I was crying, and, um, at a certain point, a police officer slapped me behind the head, and was like, "Remember!" And then he slapped me again and said, "Remember," like, "Get your brain straight." And I broke. What started popping in my mind was the street in front of Raffaele's apartment... my front door being open... Patrick in his brown leather jacket... and Meredith screaming. And I thought that meant that I was remembering that he had killed her. I was shocked. Because what she said made her at least an accomplice to the murder. And Sollecito, why did he lie? And so I decided to have all three of them arrested. We feel very sad for the girl that died, yet there is also great satisfaction for the Perugian police for having found the answers in such a short time. The press put pressure on us, and as a result we felt the responsibility for a city that wanted a definitive answer right away. I can't thank everybody enough in this entire investigation for their professionalism as well as their moral commitment. "Caso chiuso." Case closed. You'd have thought they'd busted some sort of mafioso godfather, the way they were reacting. The lawyers are the key ones. I would get alongside one of the lawyers. He would hand me over the statements. I think the photocopying places in Perugia must have made a fortune those days. We had these details coming out. The friends of Meredith were telling us how Amanda had been behaving in the waiting room. One of the friends said to Amanda, "Well, I hope Meredith didn't suffer badly." Amanda said, "Of course she fucking suffered, she had her throat fucking cut." This police officer, in this disclosure, said, "Amanda and Raffaele were kissing each other. She was performing cartwheels and doing stretching exercises." "'Course she did it. She's mad. She's a complete and utter loon. I mean, who behaves like that?" No comment, please. Are you still convinced about Amanda's innocence? No comment. The guards came to my door and said, "You have visitors." They put me in this special little office. And there was my mom. And she was crying. And she reached out for me and... Mom! - It's okay. - I know, it's scary. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Okay. Amanda, sit down. Bring a chair over here. I knew that I had fucked up, and I felt like I had fucked up, and that I didn't know what to do. I felt like a child again. And I knew... I was a kid. What was I pretending? I needed my mom. And... You know, the lawyers were saying... no matter what, if you had gone in and done the deed, they just needed to know, for sure, the truth. - So that they could-- - Yeah, and I'm telling you-- So you have no idea who murdered-- I have no clue. No clue. Because I was with Raffaele at his house. The one thing that's really bugging me is why Raffaele lied. Well, hopefully, he's in the same position you are, that he was being stressed. Yeah, I feel like they were smacking him around or something like that. The lawyers said something interesting. They said, "Amanda's been caught up in something that's way bigger than her." Because this has turned into this huge international bullshit story. - Are you serious? - Oh, yeah. Everybody in the family has been assaulted by the media. It's gone crazy. We already had good pictures of Meredith. She was a terribly attractive woman. And now we've got Amanda Knox involved as well. Pretty blonde girl, 20-something. It had that sexual intrigue. Girl-on-girl crime, if you like. The pack were in their hotel room, and everyone was going, "Amanda Knox," tap, tap, tap, into their computer. This picture pops up on MySpace of Amanda Knox with a machine gun, laughing hysterically as she was firing it. We were thinking, "Wow, great. She's a complete and utter nutjob." We had Raffaele Sollecito, tapped him in, and there he was, dressed as a mummy, with a meat cleaver. I mean, you just couldn't ask for any better material to illustrate a story with. Raffaele collects knives. He drives a nice car. He was majoring in engineering. This guy wasn't very sexually experienced. She might've been only the second person that he'd ever had sex with. And she'd sort of... got her hooks into him. She'd been seen nuzzling with a boyfriend at a local shop as they bought underwear for her. The store owner said he heard them laughing about having hot sex that night, just a day after her roommate had been found murdered. "La Femme Fatale," "La Dominatrice," "Amanda Mangiatrice Di Uomini," Amanda the man-eater. Finally, you have her own name for herself, "Foxy Knoxy." It was a perfect headline, really, the perfect name. I mean, it was a feeding frenzy for everyone, basically. I mean, you were getting front pages. I don't think I've ever had so many front pages. Front page after front page, page lead in the paper after page lead. Just story after story. Patrick! How are you, Patrick? I'm good. Thank God I get to go home. Patrick! Why did Amanda accuse you? What do you think of Amanda? Why did Amanda say those things? Why did she falsely accuse him? Can you give me an answer? I think it's a little bit hard, huh? The only reason would be to divert the investigation away from her. And so in comes Giuliano Mignini. I just remember that he was a big man, very solemn. I asked her, "Why did you accuse Patrick?" Why? I was stressed. I was scared. It was after long hours. It was in the middle of the night. I was innocent, and they were telling me that I was guilty. For the record, she's crying. I told him it was because they had said that I had met him. They had shown me his text message and said that I had met him, and that I must have not remembered it because it was so traumatizing. She kept insisting and insisting, "They told me to say Lumumba's name. They told me to. They told me to." I didn't understand this. Earlier she said that it could have been true. In that moment, I thought it could have been true. Usually a person says, "That's true" or "That's not true." But Amanda had a very unusual way of reasoning. She kept going between dream and reality. He just kept asking the question again. Again and again and again. "No, why did you... Why did you say, 'Patrick Lumumba'?" You made me believe I met Patrick Lumumba. Therefore, I said Patrick Lumumba. It wasn't the answer that he wanted, and I realized that, and I... was devastated. Like, when that happened, I realized that they weren't ever going to listen to me again. This is Amanda's weakness. She can't stand being questioned. And she also has an attitude... hostility and rebellion toward authority. It's a little bit anarchist. I don't know if there is such an attitude in Seattle. This I don't know. It's possible to speculate of course, but instead I choose to stick to the facts. I've always wanted to be a journalist ever since I was a kid. I mean, everyone knows Woodward and Bernstein. I mean, I wouldn't dream of putting myself in their shoes or anything, but I'm naturally nosy as well, which is always a good talent to have, if you like, if you can call it a talent, to be a journalist. Amanda was in a cell at Capanne jail with two other inmates. She obviously underwent a medical examination. She had a blood test, and they then told her that she was HIV-positive and that she was going to develop AIDS. I remember she was writing in her diary that she was terrified. She was saying that she wanted to have a family, and that idea was now scuppered. And then she was, sort of, listing all her lovers and saying oh, she remembered using protection with that one, and not with that one. And this was all in her diary, which, again, was leaked. I mean, I managed to get ahold of it as well. I was probably one of the first people who managed to get ahold of it. How did that diary even get to the press? Well, we never... we never reveal our sources. That's the key thing. 'Cause you do that, and then you're just betraying all your journalistic principles, aren't you? And then it turned out that she didn't have HIV, and it was just mind games being played on her by the police and the prosecution. At the time, people were saying, "Oh, how could you do that? How could you cover such a story? And how could you be involved?" And yet at the same time, these are the same people who are... logging onto the Internet first thing in the morning, trying to find out the latest details, you know? Enough. You've already filmed enough. Hello? Come over here. We are at Sollecito's. The knife that was used in the murder still hadn't been found. They did a search at Sollecito's house. They went into the kitchen and found a number of knives. And they found one that matched the characteristics of the murder. It is a kitchen knife found in Sollecito's house, which he shared with Amanda Knox. The knife. The knife is a fundamental element. Amanda's DNA was found on the handle. Meredith's DNA was found on the tip of the blade. The knife was found after a search ordered by me. The knife, I could not explain. There was no reason for my DNA to have been on a handle, and Meredith's DNA to have been on the blade. It was impossible. It's soaked in blood. Therefore, she had it on her when she was killed. This has been ripped. The part with the clasp is missing. Here it is. After some time, we found that Meredith's bra clasp contained traces of Sollecito's DNA. This is a very significant fact. I remember my colleagues complimenting me and saying, "At this point, there's no hope for the two of them." I grew up in the southern part of Italy, close to the sea. I was very shy. And I didn't date girls. Who cares when you can have the new Sega Mega Drive or PlayStation? So, when I was with Amanda, I was so happy to enjoy life and to enjoy my new relationship. Why should I go and murder a girl? This, for me, is craziness. Now, I'm taking part of this nightmare, on this tragedy, and my life is going to be destroyed... forever by all this... if nothing changes. I remember that we were nearby Sollecito's house. Lumumba was no longer a suspect. But the police told me they had found proof Meredith had definitely been killed by three people. For a bizarre case with so many twists and turns, let's start with the latest one. Police have been unable to identify a number of fingerprints where Meredith died. And they say they also found feces in the bathroom. They found traces in Meredith's vagina... and then there were the prints. They were sure that the man who had left the traces... was Rudy Herman Guede. Rudy Guede had a bit of form for breaking and entering. Locals, as well, had told us that he was a slippery character. Fly-by-night guy. But by this time, he'd already fled the country. And police were able to track down one of his best friends to have a Skype conversation with him. You there? - Can you hear me? - Yes. The girl who's been killed... I met her the previous evening. The next day, I went to her house, but we didn't do anything because neither of us had a condom. And so I went to the bathroom. After that, I heard screaming and I quickly came out of the bathroom. I saw this guy. I didn't see his face because it was dark. Then he ran out the front door. I saw Meredith, who was bleeding. She had a cut on her throat. She was clinging on me strongly. I got scared. I was completely covered with blood. Fuck, I'm scared. I'll kill myself. An international arrest warrant was issued. And he was arrested. Oh, my God! Just the idea of knowing who could have done it. Like, I know him, kind of. I've seen him before with the neighbors. Like, we ran into him and we were talking to him or whatever. And then, I think I saw him play basketball with them once. And then, I think once I saw him at my work. But, like, I don't even know his name. Rudy has always maintained that he didn't kill anyone. But any good lawyer must be aware of the fact that a judge may not believe your client. Rudy's presence in the house is undisputed. If we'd had a trial with the other two defendants, Rudy would run the risk of being blamed for everything, and Rudy might be the only one convicted. So I decided we'd go for a fast-track trial to separate the two trials. Once Rudy's trial begins, there is this interesting revelation. So, in those initial Skype conversations, Rudy is telling his friend that Amanda is nowhere near the crime scene. He's saying that they had nothing to do with it. But then... He then changes his story. Through the window, I saw the silhouette of Amanda Knox leaving the house. No one was really that bothered about Rudy. I mean, obviously we gave it the cursory coverage. We had covered his trial, covered his sentence. But at the end of the day, there was no interest in him. Who was more interesting? Amanda. The cult of the girl known as "Foxy Knoxy" is why Italians are calling this the trial of the decade. You're talking about it, everyone is talking about it. Sex. A drug-fueled sex game. Drug-fueled sex game. A drug-fueled sex game gone wrong. Calm down, calm down! There is room enough for everybody! You have to go back to your place. Go away, please! Madame, you can't push like that. I didn't do anything to you. When the trial started, I thought that everything would be easy. There was direct evidence, like the DNA proof, but there is not only the DNA. Amanda was a girl that was very uninhibited. She would bring boys home. Hearing Meredith's friends... If you could imagine a girl different from Amanda in every imaginable way, it would have been Meredith. That night, let's imagine what Meredith finds. She sees suddenly in her house Amanda, which is okay. But Sollecito and Rudy. And she's like, "What?" Meredith couldn't take it anymore. She must have scolded Amanda for her lack of morals. How did it go today? Amanda must have felt humiliated, irritated. "So, you want to judge my morals so harshly? Now I'm going to show you what will happen..." She is a very proud girl. Here's a first clash. And then there's a crescendo of attacks. I am convinced that Sollecito and Rudy were trying to indulge Amanda in every possible way that night. Pleasure at any cost. This is at the heart of most crimes. After nearly a year of testimony, Italy's so-called trial of the century has come to a close. Amanda Knox may know her fate as early as tomorrow. There may be a verdict. Amanda! Amanda! The moment before the court reads the verdict is one of the most tense moments one can experience in life, especially for the defendant because it is about their destiny. Asking for the conviction, such a severe penalty of two young people on a human level, costs a lot. I look at myself in the mirror and I'm lucky not to be ashamed of myself, there is no doubt about the guilt of the pair. Please, there are too many cameras. Please, please. One cannot get in. Given Articles 533 and 535 of the Penal Proceedings Code... we declare Knox, Amanda Marie, and Sollecito, Raffaele guilty of the crimes charged. They are convicted to a sentence of 26 years in prison for Knox and a sentence of 25 years for Sollecito. With the white-hot glare of reporters and cameras Amanda was led away in a black van, just moments after the verdict was read. She's a murderer. She's a liar. The verdict floored an unsuspecting Knox family. So convinced were they of their daughter's innocence, they'd brought her younger sisters along to court. Move. When do you hope to lodge an appeal, sir? The second we can. Everyone in the room here obviously associates Meredith with a tragic event, but we would prefer not to remember her in that way. It does bring just that little bit of justice for us, for her. Ultimately, you know, we are pleased with the decision, but it's not a time for celebration at the end of the day. Normally, people say that "Nobody is a prophet in his own country," but that's not what I experienced. Complete strangers would come up to me and ask to shake my hand. They would congratulate me. It gives me satisfaction. Because Perugia is my little homeland. Suddenly, I found myself tossed into this dark place. I was so scared. Like, who do you turn to? What do you do? I thought about suicide. I thought about all the ways that I could do it. Me not coming home again until I'm in my 50s... until members of my family have died. I was poisoned. I don't know what else to say. I spent almost six months in solitary confinement. I was... I was getting to depression. Who can help me? Who can take me off from this? I was thinking about Amanda. And I wanted to send her flowers for her birthday. To say, "I'm here. I'm by your side. I still have feelings for you." But she clearly told me that her feelings were completely changed. This moment was kind of bitter... even though I've known her only for five days. That five days were everything. The convicted killer, Amanda Knox, was back in court today. They called her "Foxy Knoxy." Looked a little more pale today, skinnier than had been in the past. Maybe could use hair and makeup, but I guess you don't get that in jail. In an unexpected plea to the court, Knox delivered a tear-filled declaration of innocence. I never expected to find myself here, convicted of a crime I didn't commit. To Meredith's family, I'm very sorry that Meredith isn't here anymore. I can't possibly know how you feel, but I too have little sisters. The idea of their suffering... and never seeing them again terrifies me. A legal victory for American Amanda Knox, who is appealing her murder conviction in Italy. The appeals court gave the go-ahead for an independent review of crucial DNA evidence. Among the pieces of evidence that an outside expert will now re-examine, a knife and a bra clasp, both considered crucial to Knox's conviction. Let it be clear how easy it is to leave traces of DNA. You move your hand on your arm, that small amount of fine dust, those are all DNA traces which we spread within the area where we are in that particular moment. Therefore, a crime scene must be kept completely sterile. That's not what happened in this case. In the video taken by the forensic police, there was a lot of chaos. You can see clearly a coming and going of people without protective suits. Booties were not changed. And they rarely change their gloves. In other words, total chaos. Chaos. That, the forensic police expressed themselves. This is absurd. Really absurd. I criticized it harshly. There's unbelievable disorganization in every respect. Contamination was one of the issues raised by the court. Could there be a contamination? The bra clasp was found under a small rug 46 days after the murder. After 46 days, it's possible that other people could have brought DNA traces from the hallway, the bathroom, kitchen or other rooms, into Meredith's room. In fact, on the clasp, there's Sollecito's DNA profile, but there were at least two others. But the police never noted them as evidence. DNA must be objective. You can't interpret it for what you want it to be. And I must say that... there were also problems with contamination in the laboratory. The forensics police definitively identified Amanda's profile. You could see it very well. It was a good profile. But with regards to Meredith's DNA found, it was such a small amount, so scarce. When you have such scarce DNA, the likelihood of contamination is very high. So we asked the forensic police, "When analyzing the knife, did you analyze it alone, without any other evidence?" And she replied, "No, we examined 50 of Kercher's samples at the same time. The laboratory couldn't just shut down because Kercher had died." When she reported these things, I was sure the results were because of contamination. When it came out, I mean, it was just... crazy. The botched investigation and the bungled forensic work. I remember audible gasps from the press and from everyone in the court. We're all looking, as journalists, for that great angle or that great line. And when you see something like that, you just think, "Brilliant. It's manna from heaven, it really is." Amanda Knox's hand was said to have been on that knife. It was said to have murdered the victim in this case. No DNA. What? This is Italy, Shepard, it's a crazy... It's a little different than we're used to. Bunga bunga. One of... The one guy who... The thing I can't wrap my mind around, though, is if the DNA evidence isn't credible, how did things get to this point? You really believe that Americans should intervene at the top levels of our government? I think the president should get involved. I think people should boycott Italy. They shouldn't go to Italy. It bothered me that the American media lectured us about the law. This courthouse, in 1308, housed the first faculty of law in Europe. In America, in 1308, they were drawing buffalos in caves. I was irritated by all this avalanche of attacks, especially against me and the police. The American media was focusing only on the DNA. Every piece of proof has aspects... of uncertainty. That's why evidence needs to be evaluated in its entirety. I hear talk... "For me, Amanda is guilty because she said too many lies." I have to remind you that her behavior was completely inexplicable. Totally irrational. There's no doubt of this. There is no trace of me in the room where Meredith was murdered, and there's no reliable trace of Raffaele in the room where Meredith was murdered. But you're trying to find the answer in my eyes, when the answer's right over there. You're looking at me. Why? These are my eyes. They're not objective evidence. What's more likely? That I... get together this boyfriend that I've had and this guy, who I don't even know his name, tell them to rape my roommate and then let me stab her to death? Or... that a guy, who regularly committed burglaries, broke into my home... found Meredith... took advantage of her... killed her... and ran off? A burglary gone wrong. It has been said to me it could have been no one but Rudy. It's him, and only him. Well, I don't think that's very fair. We absolutely cannot speak about the figure of Rudy Guede. What happened inside that room between Guede and poor Meredith wasn't part of the job assigned to me by the Court of Appeals of Perugia. I do feel compelled to say something Cicero once said... "Any man is liable to make mistakes... but only the fool perseveres in error." Do you think you did a good job defending Rudy? Ask the others. I don't understand. Ask the others who had a better defense if Rudy's defense was a good defense. Rudy will be getting out shortly. The others still have to face a trial. The decision is yours, to try to bring justice and defend the honor of this country, which is a sovereign state. Four years after the brutal murder of British roommate Meredith Kercher, it's all come down to this. Outside the courthouse, the world awaits. Frenzied journalists from around the globe all counting down the moments until Amanda Knox's fate is revealed. Amanda is at the courthouse, and will be brought into the courtroom shortly, where she will hear the verdict read. In the name of the Italian people, in review of the first trial verdict, this Court of Appeals absolves the two defendants because they did not commit the crime, and orders the immediate release of Knox, Amanda and Sollecito, Raffaele. The 24-year-old Seattle native collapsed in the arms of her lawyers as her family, all gathered in the courtroom, swept each other up in their arms. Outside the courthouse, however, a different reaction. Great disappointment among people out here that Amanda Knox has been found not guilty in the murder of Meredith Kercher. It's a shame! Shut up! The court has said that they are acquitted, but there will be the Supreme Court! Let's not give up! This is a shame! Shame! And breaking news tonight, Amanda Knox finally home. That was the plane carrying her and her family. This is actually a live picture now. A crush of media and well-wishers are waiting for her at the Seattle-Tacoma Airport. There she is, there she is, there she is, there she is, there she is. - She's there. - She's there. - She's there. - She's there. She is coming down the stairs. She's coming down the stairs. - She's coming down the stairs. - Coming down the stairs. What's important for me to say is just thank you to everyone who's believed in me... who has defended me, who has supported my family. I just want... My family's the most important thing to me right now, and I just wanna go and be with them. So, thank you for being there for me. When I went back home, the first thing that I did was stare in the fridge. And I was looking at it like something incredibly new, like I was a primitive, uh, man. I was free. I was joyful. But all of a sudden, I was, um, dramatically depressed again, 'cause I didn't know how to start again. Everything was new. I spent four years in prison, six months in solitary. How can I get used to this life that I didn't want? I was a simple computer guy. Now everybody knows me. They look at me on the street, they ask me questions. Uh, they treat me like a movie star, when I'm not. And I'm inside a tragedy still. Congratulations. Congratulations, Amanda. - Please leave me alone, please. - Welcome home. Welcome home, Amanda. Does it feel good to be home? What did you miss most about Seattle? It's really a matter of what does she do with this newfound fame? Does she write the book and move on with her life? Does she then try to go on Dancing with the Stars? That's where we're gonna really see what her motivations are. What movie offers have you received? That's not our focus at this point in time. Our focus is her, uh, well-being. Are you aware that, I suppose, the longer you leave it, in a sense, the less, you know, the less money you're going to get ultimately? What you mean is? Well, you're not such... She's not such a hot property on an interview term if you wait a month. Um... I'm not looking at her as a hot property. I really thought that I was going to be okay. But I wasn't the same person to come back to Seattle. The whole world knew who I had ever had sex with. Seven men. And yet, I was some heinous whore. Bestial and sex-obsessed and unnatural. I'd get into a line at the grocery store and the person behind me is like, "Whoa! It's you! I know you!" And I really wanna turn to them and say, "Who the fuck are you? And you don't know me." You have to wonder what is it that everyone really cares about? But how entertaining. Italy's top appeals court is to rule today on whether to uphold the conviction of American Amanda Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher. Amanda Knox's Italian attorney this morning says, "Amanda is worried and has had a sleepless night. Meredith Kercher's family has made its wishes clear. They are convinced of Amanda's guilt and would like to see her imprisoned back where this all began, in Italy." It's a countdown to when the verdict should be read. Phones had to be turned off inside the courtroom. They'll be turned on as soon as the judge finishes reading, and then we'll learn the sentence. Attention! The news is that Raffaele Sollecito and Amanda Knox have been exonerated. - Oh, my God! What? - Holy shit! I know! This is crazy! Raffaele? We're free! How are you? I'm so happy for you. I'm so happy for us. Much love and we'll talk soon. Bye. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God! The first reaction was one of surprise. Uh... They've had two convictions... um... and they've had two acquittals now. It seems an awful long time to get such a strange verdict. Um, eight years. So it's sort of bringing everything into disrepute. I think at the end of the day, you have to point the finger at the police, really, and the prosecution. They made some really heinous errors and they got fixated on some wild theories that they were absolutely obsessed with. I know people keep saying "Trial by media, trial by media," but... I don't buy that. Maybe 'cause I'm a journalist so I don't go for that, but... I think now, looking back, some of the information that came out was just crazy, really, and just completely made up. But, hey, what are we supposed to do, you know? We are journalists and we are reporting what we are being told. It's not as if I can say, "Right, hold on a minute. I just wanna double check that myself in some other way." I mean, goodness knows how. And then I let my rival get in there first before me, and then, hey, I've lost a scoop. It doesn't work like that. Not in the news game. During the trial there was a woman who... She said I was the devil. "You are evil." I can say that I've made mistakes, even things that I have had to confess, but we are all between good and evil. It's in our human nature. Amanda and Sollecito, if they are innocent, I hope they're able to forget the suffering that they've endured. If they're guilty, if earthly justice didn't get to them, I hope they own their guilt, because I know that life ends with a final trial. A trial with no appeals, no second chances, and no revisions. I think people love monsters. And so when they get the chance, they want to see them. It's people projecting their fears. They want the reassurance that... they know who the bad people are, and it's not them. So maybe that's what it is. We're all afraid. And fear makes people crazy.
