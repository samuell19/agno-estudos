Do angels exist? "The Road to Success" The General Bank What's the highest position one could reach here? Managing Director What would that pay? 150,000 a year. Expense-account, car... And a 3,000 bonus if he behaves himself. I'm very well-behaved. Y'know... That's not bad. No, not bad at all. You could check it out now. It's almost lunch time. Next floor up... "Stenman" on the door. Stenman. - So I can just start with lunch? - Sure, no worries. Mr Director, Sir! Bon appetit! The same to you, Sir. Thank you. Come... Come in! I'm here about the position. What position? That one. I eat lunch at 1 o'clock. I've read that most office-workers do that. I could go so far as to say 92.7 per cent. You're interested in the position of trainee-commissionaire? Yes. My mum always said there's a future with the bank. 7 percent dividend paid on its shares. She means that I should have a future in the bank. I think so, too. Are you applying or not? Yes. I'll just check. You seem the neat and tidy type. Thank you. Same to you. Nutritious! Adds calcium. Good for the teeth. Excellent for... ...fitness. Prevents hardening of the arteries. - Louise... - Yes? Whereabouts are my ships' biscuits? Karen, dear... the admiral's ships' biscuits. The dog biscuits are in the right hand jar. Someone has been rummaging about in the 16th century. I dusted your weapon collection myself, early this morning. And came up with the absurd idea... ...of putting a flintlock pistol amongst 16th century matchlock weapons. Hardly of world-shattering importance. World-shattering?! The history of firearms is... ...the foundation of modern culture. I'll buy you a satellite for your collection. A satellite is hardly a firearm. Good morning, anyway. Are you going to the bank, naked? Do up your button, Margareta! Good morning, Mummy. There's Rolf! 'Bye, Mummy... goodbye, Daddykins. Goodbye? Isn't she having any...? She's slimming. Slimming? Good heavens. Rolf is such a nice young man. He is. But he's not a naval officer. Shipowners also have something to do with boats. Humph!... the merchant navy! No, pet, I'll be late for the bank. The weather's changing. I'll soon have the hood up. I want to go with it open. We'll get wet. You could've asked me. I put more faith in the weather forecasters. You're silly. And mean. On about that again? Diamonds are no good as an investment. A measly bracelet. For 2,000! You've nagged enough... I'll get it for you. Then I don't want it. Are you sure. I'm sure not getting a sentimental wife. You're sitting reading?! Yes... I haven't quite decided what I'll be here. No, there's a lot to choose from. That's right... You have to set yourself a firm goal That's right. And here... no... here! "Whatever position you have..." "...you must make sure that..." "...everybody knows who you are, and what you do." It'll take me 15 years. 30 seconds, gentlemen. 30 seconds! Hey, look! What a woman! That one? It's just the clothes. Such poise... such a figure! She has true beauty. The truth will disappear with soap and water. Good morning, Miss Gunther... I think more beautiful than ever. Thank you for the compliment, Mr Hagson. Hi. Well I'll be damned! That's the woman I'm going to marry. Mr Waller is due any moment, Sir. That's Raeder, the manager. Thank you. Aren't we a respectful pair! He's a big wheel. Through him, the bank holds sway over the business world. And he controls the bank. Exactly... everything except the weather. Parlez-vous francais? Une minute, s'il vous plait. Parlez-vous francais? Une minute, s'il vous plait. Parlez-vous francais? No, je... Damn it, I'm sorry... One moment... Une minute, s'il vous plait. Larsson! Larsson, come here... This Frenchman wants something. Would you help him. Unfortunately this is Froman, our new commissionaire. He can't have realised who you were, Sir. But why weren't you talking Swedish? I'm sorry, but I thought you were a Frenchman, Sir. You seemed just like one. Frenchman? Rubbish! Actually it's quite funny... ...if it was deliberate. What ever have you done?! Made myself known to Waller. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Are you coming? No, I have to work back. 'Bye. - 'Bye. - 'Bye. Johannson's drawer... the worst one! I did it, it was my fault. No, it was my fault. It's just that... ...I'm supposed to be leaving. I'll fix them up... you go. That's so nice of you, thanks. - I'm Miss Gunther. - Froman. Froman? What department? Commissionaire. Eternally grateful! I'll be happy to help you any time you need it. I'll take you up on that. Thanks. You're a peach! Thanks. Have fun! 'Bye. 'Bye. Have you found yourself a blueberry patch? You can come help pick them up... I know... my once-in-a-lifetime chance to be invited to a society wedding! Want to come home with me for a bite to eat? I can prepare dinner. Froman? Do you have a split personality? No, my mum lives there... I live here. Thank you. I'll take those. Tell me... do you live alone? Yes. It's Mum's place. Careful. What work did you do before? - Nothing at all. - What? You must have done something. I went sailing, of course, and fixed Mum's radio. This is the dining room. This is the home workshop. Is this the radio you fixed? I've been working on it for five years. All the parts are there. As the trunk murderer said when he pleaded. I haven't needed to work, with this place and Mum's money. - I've read a lot. - I can see that. Has your money run out? No, I'm working for the prestige of it. As a trainee commissionaire? I want to know I'm good at something. That's what motivates a man. - You're good enough. - Come and we'll get something. This is Mum's store. Good heavens! I get this at wholesale prices. What would you like? No, you can choose yourself. Something for a sandwich... And how about we have some soup... So we'll have this, and a hot dish... And some dessert. Is this the dinner you said you could prepare?! Of course. Let's get going. Does your mum live on tinned food too? She doesn't live at all. You mean...? When? 6 years ago. Just when I started working on the radio. Wine's something you drink at a funeral. - Oh, sorry. - Don't mention it. A toast to the future! Cheers! Not a bad drop. Here's to Margareta Gunther. She's engaged. Cheers! Who's she engaged to? A guy called Rolf Graner. Shipowner. Filthy rich. Hundreds of thousands of tons of shipping. End of story. That's how all good fairy stories begin. There are two things you can never rely on... And that is, pretty... Did you throw that away? There are two things you can never rely on... They are pretty girls and cheap alarm clocks. And unfamiliar drinks. Turn that off! It's time to call in Raeder's stock exchange quotations. Every church has its god. Raeder is the bank's. He's on the board of directors. If you're so wrapped in the guy... ...do me a favour and call in his goddamn quotations. What do I do? You ring up... he coughs... you start reading... ...till he grunts or coughs, and you wait to continue reading. He hangs up then you hang up, and you may cough if you wish. What do you do when you have a cold? Just call him now. Did you hear that Andren shall move to section 16? Hoganas, 80 - 85... IFO Works 220 - 223... Are they now promoting people on merit? I don't know. In that case even I might move up a rung. Investor 543 - 545 Artillery Mfg 315 - 325 Kopparfors 305 - 355 Kullager Series A 412 - 415 Finished? Yes. The office wants you to go down to the vault to get the gold standard One year's cash... Gold standard? The vault? Cash? Sure. You alright? Yes, thanks. How did you get here? What is it? Do you like sailing? Yes, a lot! - Do you sail? - Yes, a lot. Oh, the bank! I'll be sailing on Saturday...' Come along. Alone?! I'm always alone. Come along, if you like. Alright... but you have to promise to behave yourself. There'll be no need for you to ask that. There's something you have to promise me though. What's that? You mustn't wear that perfume. And you're not to wear a blouse that buttons up the front. I promise. I promise! Mr Raeder... Attention! Yes? Are you scared of Raeder? Scared? No, but I have respect. Leave that to me. You do it... I'll soon be on holidays. He's most interested in nitro-glycerin. Why's that? Is going to blow up the bank? No, but he grunted most on that one. That's it! Get a pencil... Mark a cross for every grunt and a stroke for every sigh. Aeroplan 84 - 88... AGA 245 - 253... Asea 186 - 187 Grunt. - What did you say? - Grunt. Metalworks 160 - 163 Sigh. Artillery Mfg 460 - 490 Oink-oink. Pripp and Lyckholm Sigh Nitroglycerin Works 465... What are you up to? The lock combination for the boardroom. Have you gone quite mad? Jan... The wooden bridge near the naval dockyard? Sure! It's not allowed to tie up there. That's why it's very suitable. Goodbye. 3 o'clock. What's the time? Do I dare go on holiday? Well now...! Going sailing? Why? Aren't I allowed? Of course you are. We're just going out for a while. Be back this evening. Margareta, my pet... I know what you imagine. Imagine? You know for a fact as well as I do. The one in there isn't the only one. That wasn't what I meant. You see... Rolf is a grown man, and you are so young. You don't need to be anxious about the engagement. I'm not the slightest bit anxious. Well, that's fine then. - What's important to a man... - I know exactly, Mummy. Rolf is rich enough to marry the princess of the parish, and also keep a mistress. So long as you understand that, it will be fine. Yes, it might be hurtful... ...but in a way it shows that Rolf respects you. I don't want to be respected. I don't feel hurt. I'm just cross... ...angry... vexed... FURIOUS! Now I'm going sailing. Listen... I thought you said you were coming home this evening. Yeah... What's his name? Jan... Froman. So... Jan. Yes... I assume that you do realise that you should NOT be going sailing. Mummy, it's not at all like you think. He's nice, he's kind, he's sweet. No money. Not a bit handsome... Just a bit. Sounds like a terrible mix. He's well brought up and polite. They are often the most dangerous. They can hide the most shameful intentions with beautiful words. Halleluya! I promise that you can trust me. Can I? There've been moments when I wouldn't trust myself. Think about the sea and the night and the boat. Then he's less of a danger. Who are you traveling with? Dad's not going to let me. Can you imagine Margareta wanting to go sailing in this wind? With the sea so dangerous. Dangerous?! Women! Of course she'll go sailing. What if there's a dead calm? She could be stuck out there all night. A night at sea isn't so dangerous. Please don't let anything happen! What could happen out on the lake? The same as is happening now. Nobody's ever died of sea air. No, I was afraid of the sea air doing the opposite. I could do this for eternity... You can. No, we must must be home this evening. Without fail! Can I help you with anything? You can lay the table. Glad to. What's this? Larder. Cans! That's right. And wine. ...and flowers, never so sweetly perfumed... ...like when you walked beside me... ...towards the gorgeous evening sunset... ...when your curls hid me from the world... ...and you drowned all my sorrows, darling... ...with your very first kiss. Are you religious? Only out here. Never in town. "Your tongue conceals honey..." "...and the scent of your clothes is the scent of Lebanon." "A hidden perfumed garden is my sister, my bride..." "...a hidden stream, a sealed spring." Let's clear the table and go to bed. I'm going out to get some water. To do the washing up. "May my friend come to his perfumed garden..." "...and eat of its noble fruit" I'm ready. Good. So let's go to bed. You sleep up here in the cottage and I'll sleep on the boat. Goodnight. Pleasant dreams. Goodnight. 'bye. 'bye. Religious people are phoney. Really? Why? Why? You said you were religious out here, but not in town. That's just a con... You are what you say you are or you're not. Sometimes you have to compromise. No idea what you're talking about. Amen. You'll learn to understand. In town it's all about front, and standards. Nothing wrong with that. But 5 rooms and kitchen, WC, colour TV and a new Cadillac... They're all meaningless. But the struggle to get them is a value in itself. So your jewellery is only worthy of the efforts of those who bought it. Otherwise just something to boast about. You'd do the same. - It's only envy. - Not at all. Prove it. Well... Tell me what you'll do about the bank. I'll ask to come back. My fiance is on the board of the bank... He helps to make important decisions and carry them through. He doesn't believe in jewellery as an investment. I've got it! The proof. That value lies in achievement. I'll buy you a trinket with the first money that proves I can really do something. Now I'll sail us home. Aye aye, captain! I'll set the course. I want to choose the jewelery myself. But of course! Don't regret your promise. - Jan... - Yes? Look at me. Yes? Heal me. No, I didn't mean it. Bye! And thanks. No more poker for me! - Was it that bad? - Sure was. I won! I won! Yes... Take a look at this. Look! I'm afraid I'll lose it all. How much is there? Don't know. - What shall I do with it? - Calm down! I need to think about it. But how much is it? I don't know... four or five thousand. No ideas? My wife has always wanted a small business. A little sweetshop. Sweets and fruit... they do well. But this isn't enough, is it? You can borrow my mum's money. We put this lot in the bank. What are we doing? Putting this in the bank. You put my money in your account? It's not my account It's my mum's account. That means there's no danger. I'm an honest man. But the principle. I have no principles. That doesn't make sense. Not with me... I've got good sense. What about your millions? I bought shares with the lot. What did you buy? "Artillery Mfg" Why? There'll probably be war. The stupidest... Selling at...? 325? Have you seen the paper? - Have you? - Oh yes. 315! Do you understand what you've lost? Thank goodness I know a little sweetshop. I'd like to ask who's behind such speculation. Apparently from a deceased estate... that of Henrietta Froman. Mortgaged up to the ears... if you can talk about a dead granny's ears. Everything's been put into shares. A very shrewd purchase. Winning the pools and shares... the modern Swede's dream of happiness. It soon goes pear-shaped. Every single good speculation I ferret out is snapped up by that dead biddy. Positively spooky! That's what it is. There must be a leak... Have you investigated? Yes... nothing there... except... Could YOU be suffering from some economic prostate problems in your old age? - I plead for mercy! - Don't worry, I'd never believe it! So long as the late witch doesn't put a broom to the Artillery MFG shares. Now it's in the paper as well. What? The latest is that Artillery Mfg shares are falling. Financial interests are trying to prop the stock up. And this... Many innocent investors will be affected. This is Raeder writing. Time to buy the rest. Listen... If I mortgage Mum's shop... Have you gone totally crazy? Now it's my turn. Give me the paper. Does Raeder lie for the paper? No! You're so pedantic. Artillery Mfg... ...totally bankrupt. You're looking very glum, Mr Hagson Yes... about Jan. - Is it serious? - Yes, unfortunately And him with his mum. His mum? Yes. Jan...! That was unfortunate about your mum. My mum? Yes, it was. I'd be happy to console you if you'd like to date me. Thanks, I'd be happy to. 'Bye Hi there, pauper! You shouldn't be smiling. You've only yourself to blame. I met Margareta. Margareta? I'm talking about Artillery Mfg. Luckily I don't have a cent in those junk shares. Yes you do. Your poker winnings that I put in Mum's account and then into shares. They were cheap so you got quite a lot. My fruit shop. Artillery Mfg went up today. By how much? - About 30. - What a joke! So, what Raeder wrote...? He lied. Look at this. This cross... ...means... Every time we read the stock quotations for Raeder... ...he grunts... ...every time he makes a note to buy. The rest can be worked out. How much for me? 3,000 plus 4,800. The rest you can borrow from Mum's money. The fruit shop! What'll you do with your dough? An investment in proving myself to Margareta. - Are you getting anywhere? - I don't know. She did say that she wanted to console me. That's the last thing a girl says before she slips into bed with you. But good heavens...! How shall I... Excuse me! All about sex This may be of interest to you. Hi Jan, want some company? Anything else? Yes, of course... no. - What are you reading? - Natural science. Yes that could be classified as... - Are you interested in zoology? - Me? Am I ever! It's quite amusing. One often has... Come on, let's go. What about your books? Of course... Wrap them up and deliver them. Here's the money... Here's the address. But Sir... your change...? Maybe I should call the police. I think you should see a doctor... That about your mum has hit you really hard My mum? Yes, that's true... But it was 6 years ago. - 6 years ago? - That's right. That was just the shabbiest trick! To fool me that your mother... - No! - No! Just to get my sympathy! I've no idea... I've no idea what you're talking about. I have, and it's enough. Leave me alone! I don't want your sympathy. So you were prepared to break your promise. That's all I can think. There's no promise I'd rather keep. Take your pick! That's what I'd like! The ring? Yes! But that's a... No, we'll find a tiny, tiny cheap one. No. Yes. Come and have a look at it. You're already engaged. Is this a wedding ring? Could be. Do you want it? Yes! Hey, commissionaire...! Will you stop fooling around with the girls. Go and deliver these now! There's got to be order here! Damnation! Goddammned wanker! Calm down! No! That bastard deserves to be keel-hauled. Remember what I said... Order! Rotten to the core! Pirates! Throw away your damned loo-paper, instead of humiliating an honorable seaman! But Admiral... Stand at attention! Burn that garbage. Do it! I shall damn-well change banks. Understood? Silly old fool. I've a job for you. This is to be thrown in... Look at this...! These are mortgages... securities. They look like this. Could I borrow these over the weekend? No one is going to miss them. When your curls hid me from the world and you drowned all my sorrows... Darling... with your... very first... kiss. So lovely... to think and to feel... Know what I mean? Yes, I think you're going crazy. My fiance says that too. It's this damned island! - How did you get here? - Submarine. I'm crazy about it. You're wearing my ring. Rolf's as well . Listen... I have a week off. Could I stay here and try to make up my mind? - On your own? - Yes, on my own. May I? What's mine is yours. What's mine is yours? No cans though . - Good eh? - Delightful. I do have to ask. A philosopher starting with P said something about women's modesty. You read too much... Do something instead. Shall I ? have you never been in love? Unfortunately not. Yes... in Gautier... She had... ...Grey eyes, long blond hair, loved Lord Byron... ...and died in childbirth May 24, 1865. Women in books... You really are hopeless! But it can only be platonic. Have you never been together with a girl? Me? Never. It's just never happened. I didn't think that even happened in books With ME, maybe... But YOU? It's incomprehensible. I've been lucky with everything else. Except Mum's radio. It's incomprehensible. I do like you. There's something else I don't understand. My desire to unbutton your blouse. Don't laugh... It's serious. I'm sorry. If only you knew what I thought, the first time I was here. I'll never forget it. If you'd had any inkling... Yes... I did have an inkling. You did? I don't need anyone. There's a button, too. Are you crying? No... I was just so scared... How could you know how...? Are you sure you weren't lying? No I read it up. "The Complete Marriage Guide" Stuff like that. Ever since then I've known how it should be done. God, I was nervous! I shouldn't have thrown that crust at you. - Sin carries its own punishment. - I agree. Can a girl who's a virgin...? Oh yes. Can a girl who's a virgin deceive her fiance without being unfaithful? No... Not unless she was seduced. I'd say. I can't go back to him. He's going to feel terribly insulted. My dad will go crazy. Dads always give in. Not mine. Turn around so I can get dressed. I'm ready. Did you learn anything? The shortcut to the boardroom. Slow down! Put the brakes on! Stepping on the gas is the only way... Read this. What is it? "Wanted - Property... can be older or modernised" "Near the old harbour" That's the slum district. "Security. Reply to Capt. Norcross." Who's that? Great great grandfather He's a privateer. - He's still alive? - Yes... In my swashbuckling soul. - Look... - At what? A happy man. This has been in several times. Some old Jack Tar who wants to finish his days where he grew up. An opportunity for me to get rid of my dumps. It would be... The stale smell from the drains you can put down as sea air. There's some old bank property too. Maybe I can get rid of the bank's swampy vacant strip at the same time. How well-off is this guy? Don't know. No information. We need someone who knows. We should get in touch with Graner. Yes, he's the one. The bank owns this. Here's Graner's old shipyard. The shipping district. Block of flats. Factory zone. You're not thinking of... Are you thinking of buying a factory? And a number of apartment blocks. Here's the answer to the ad. That's Raeder. Captain Norkross? Froman... I'm a relative. This is Mr Hagson, a building engineer Pleased to meet you. Yes, here we have the building. Large and imposing. Not beautiful, but solid. That's how they built them in those days. There are cracks in the walls. That's quite normal, it's from the new bus route nearby. We should see the cellar, to check the foundations. It's not going to fall down. Good tenants? Splendid... No complaints. Rents paid on time. Fine people. I agree... they really are. Some major cracking here. Cooking smells... and leather. Leather? Isn't it meatballs? That sickly-sweet smell indicates rotten woodwork. Though you see the ceiling isn't mouldy. That's just the old patina. I think the patina is coming adrift. A lot seems to be in a sorry state. Maybe here... That may be so... ...but the flagging on the stairs is terrific. Terrifically bad, I'd say. Look at this. Look at this. It's rotten here. Can I pull out the skirting? We're here to look at the place, not to tear it apart. What a smell! I don't know... must be a cat. Has the Health Dept. been here? No, let's go. So let's take a look at the cellar. We might as well. Look at this. This is extremely dangerous. This has to be fixed before someone rips their clothing. Someone may have a screwdriver. No, wait there! BEGGARS REPORTED TO THE POLICE! Could I borrow a screwdriver, so I can fix a banister? This is the first time anyone fixed anything here. Don't say that... the owner is here You the owner? It's a disgrace! The wind whistles in through the windows and doors. Just unheated hovels! Do you know what this is? It's gout! Repairs? Ask anyone here... I challenge you to ring up! The kitchen sink! Yes, you're nothing more than a stinking kitchen sink! The tap! The tap... broken like everything else here. And the stove! A leaky gas stove, leaking poison gas! I'll report you to the police, you murderer! Can you go a bit slower... I'm trying to take all this down. Thanks very much, that's very good. It's not good at all! Someone knocks during the night. Shall we take a look at the cellar now? All the pipework needs replacing. I stream of water is working its way through the walls via the insulation I imagine you saw that as well. An experienced eye sees everything. Let's put our cards on the table. The building is old. Make me an offer. I think we could come up with 320,000 Stop there! You're joking of course? Make it 330,000... as a matter of principle. Done! Wait...! It's been a pleasure to do business with such a canny young businessman. Could've been crazy. What if he knew I'd spoken to the doorman. If he was aware you knew every doorman in town, you'd be on a salary of 100,000. You play poker with them. Sure!... You'll get some money to play with. I can't guarantee a win. No matter... just tell them about my terrible real estate deal. You don't need to ask me to do that. That's the spirit! Yeah... That Raeder sold cheaply. And that lunatic Froman went and bought it! Give me 4. You can't fool an old fox... ...like Raeder. Raeder says that area... the bank says that area... ...is going to be worthless. So, when Froman wanted to buy... ...Raeder sold cheap. He's not one to sit on rubbish. No one should be so lucky... ...to pull off a deal like that, says Raeder. it's got to be... ...inside information! Froman's got to be crazy... ...but then he may be... ...the only man who could get somewhere with that crazy purchase. So, a relative of yours has bought some bank real estate? So this is in relation to a mortgage... I must say it's a lot of money. You seem to know a lot about mortgages. I'll see you. Some people are inquisitive. King-high straight. What a buy that was! Four cards! I bought 4 cards and came home with the whole pot. We still haven't taken any pot home! What are you babbling about? Four new properties... Now we own the whole block! Everything except the old shipyard. No...! Not me! So... it's you again... Rip up and tear down, can you? And repair? The tap in the kitchen that I pointed out... Hello. I'm the new owner. In appreciation, your apartment will be completely renovated. Really? Thanks very much Don't mention it. On Monday and Tuesday, I missed you so much! I think I got sunburned in the most unlikely places... But it went away when I went swimming. I was swimming several hours a day. Then I hated you and me. Then I had longings. But in another way. Every bit of you is beautiful... my darling, my babe. You are quite without blemish. I'll never wear a swimming costume here. Where? Puppydog! Puppy? My man. - Are you happy now? - Yeah. I'm just weary. When I was young, I used to wonder if it would ever happen to me. Like having kids and so on, but... But? I've lost count. Anyway, what's to be done about your shipowner? The next time I'm wearing your ring, will mean I'm free You're nuts! You too. But I'm so happy! And how may I be of assistance? I'm here on business. It's to do with me. I'd like to thank you for the loan. I understand. Girls are so impatient nowadays. No, Rolf, that's not it at all. I've... met someone else. Please sit down. This is the first time you've seen me here. Hopefully not the last time. Couldn't we have this discussion another time? - No. - Please. - Why? - It'd be a shame. It's your aunt's family-dinner tomorrow. - Yes, I'd forgotten about that. - And the "Aurora" christening on Sunday. With obligations out of the way, then the engagement can crumble. Everything for the sake of good form? Maybe. We keep our promises Vote Communist We keep our promises Vote Centrist What's this? A stove? Is it being repaired? When we're suffering persecution! Voting flyers and propaganda stuffed in the letterbox... It's trespassing! Look at this. Who'll we vote for? Who thinks of us... living in this slum? There's a town plan ready for this area. Who thinks of us...? Nobody! I do! We'll put an end to this. I'll pay for the printing for you. There's a printer on the 3rd floor. You go downstairs. Sell the old shipyard now. It can pay for a wedding present for Margareta. Quite agree! Such a charming couple! Enough of that! Can't help myself. You're acting as though we're getting married tomorrow - Bye bye Auntie. - Goodnight my dear. I'll drive you home, Darling. - They're so sweet! - Yes. I haven't been unfaithful. I've just fallen out of love with one, and promised myself to another. Darling... The faithful only know the trivial side of love You're being awfully understanding... Aren't you feeling hurt? Separation's no big deal... ...I believe. No, I'll go home with Dad, instead. Hello there! In good health? How's business? Splendid! I've bought some more blocks. Since we last spoke? Might one ask at what price? Very cheaply. The sites are considered virtually worthless. Yes, that's probably right. Completely worthless. I've actually felt a bit guilty about the business we did. In that condition... and when you think of all the work and repair costs involved... I feel sorry for a decent upright boy like you. I'm prepared to buy it back. Out of the question! I'm young, I'm strong... I want to take on the difficulties involved. That's the way I feel, too. I could consider a reasonable price increase. To cover your work and out-of-pocket costs. How much? You tell me. My work is nothing to think about. No thanks. A glass of milk? However... I had figured on a substantial increase in value since last time. I saw in the paper... Forget about "A Citizen" I read that letter to the editor. Absolute worthless nonsense. A meddlesome busybody. That was me... I wrote it. Let's say 500,000 Double. Can I have right of first refusal while I think about it? Yes of course... Between business associates like us.

Rolf's cabin is quite magnificent. A dream place to be seduced in. It's a mansion, not a ship... There's not a gun to be found. We'll have to make do with champagne corks. Where's the little girl's shipowner? Ove there talking politics. The new high-rise suburb Quite laughable! I'm certainly not laughing. Politics and economics are nothing to get worked up about. When a strong argument is lacking, a weak one can accidentally work. Of course. But it's no accident when prices drop across the whole area... When my name is used for dumping purposes... And it comes out that all the blocks have the same buyer! The prices rise 30-fold because the buyer writes a letter to the editor. I'm religious enough not to believe in coincidence. I suspect there's a higher will behind this. What are you saying? Who is that? A Mr Jan Froman It was he who, on your advice, bought my worthless old shipyard. And then, with a stronger guarantee... ...I redeemed the majority of shares in Trans Ocean. The majority of shares! Congratulations, my boy! They say lucky people have topsoil in their pocket. Topsoil? Is this an agricultural meeting? I thought we were talking about a ship. "Charon's ferry." Ferry? I call it a mansion. The engines are great... Go show the lass how some real machinery works. I imagine you'd rather see the external splendours? You mean of the ship? My new greatest love. It's certainly a beautiful boat. The most beautiful thing of all. - Oh Rolf...! - What's up? I'm feeling totally lost. Did women teach you how to handle to them? Years ago. On thing sums it up... Youngsters neck... experience talks . I don't get it. Neither does any other woman under 35. Please excuse me. Not bad at all! I think Rolf's improving. I've received lots of jewellery in my time and all of it... ...well, quite a lot of of it, you'd be inheriting. Congratulations... You silly goose. Was that very friendly? Officer, would you please take this note for me. It's very important. Excuse me... - That's it. - That's what? Care to dance? Margareta! Margareta! Can I come in? Of course...! Wait... This old-fashioned furniture... It makes me feel shameless. It's never seen a naked girl before... Its morals are from centuries gone by. They're old fogies How do you think they'd feel about being in a nursery. They're going. We'll get new furniture. Electric stove, stainless steel sink, refrigerator, toaster, mincer. How do you know all that? tea-towels, dishwashing machine... Make a list. Where's the bathroom and toilet. In the yard and in the sea. Would a mistress come in the middle of the night, if she had to go out there? If she was as scruffy as you, she wouldn't dare go anywhere else. You look like a forest nymph. What happens to a man caught in her net? He's still wet behind the ears, yet he's manipulating the price rise. I looks like it's time to retire. If he had to deal with you, then... If that was all it took! He's no dummy... he's well-read. You're believing the end of the world is nigh. I don't know what to believe. A lot is bought for 1 krona a square. And now it's worth 300! 6 acres. The city's getting them. You can guess what for. Will he get a medal too? Hell no! Hello! Hello. Margareta's not here today. That's easy to explain... She'd be at home, with a helluva hangover. Maybe. It's either some damned charity... or it's business too. Maybe an attack on the rental market. If this is a business coup, it's topnotch. If you have to replace me on the board, I know a good name. Some papers to be signed. Very well. How's the Frenchman? Pretty good, thanks. Enjoying your job? Yes, I just got the sack. You did? - Petren from PR to see you. - Show him in. Sorry to interrupt... The PR department hasn't received any specific... I mean essential information on the new board-member, Mr Froman. Address... 12 Stora Karls Alley He has no private life... Just an average young man... His late mother is said to have said... "He just lies on the couch reading books." That's a quote, Sir. Alright, I'll look into it. Stenman...! Why did that commissionaire get the sack? It was Westin, who said ... that the Gunther girl winked at Froman every time he walked past. It was audacious behaviour. Froman... Like a cigar? Ready for a laugh? Listen... "We are committed to finding space for our showrooms locations" - Volvo "Planning to build the nation's largest cinema" - Sandrews - Sandrews? - Yes, not exactly small-time. "Accept the last offer." - Raeder Money. money, money, money! Money's not everything. But it means an awful lot. Tell me what's bugging you. I can't get on to Margareta... We were supposed to be sailing on Saturday. - Can't you phone her? - I have phoned... I can't get on to her. I'll go sailing on my own. What can I say... I give a damn if his ancestor has been a pirate or not It's possible there are extenuating circumstances. We won't talk about this again. Understood? Say it. Understood. I might say though, that even an admiral could understand... that one get's further with gentle coaxing. House-arrest for a week! Anyone would think I was a thief. That was a good meal you invited us to. Yes, undeservedly good. Where's my tobacco? Here, Daddy. No point in trying to get round me. What do you mean? Do you want a drink, Daddy? That'd be nice. Mum? Perhaps I could have a chartreuse. A large one? My dear child! Shall I get your slippers, Daddy? I'm already wearing them. I'm not innocent any longer. No, you are still a child. What...?! What did you say? I'm saying I've slept with Jan Froman. Hell and damnation! Damnation! Margareta, how could you do such a thing? That was unforgivably stupid. But I love him! I love him so much that I just have to! I know... I quite understand... But the way you said it... to Dad! Oh, I really haven't taught you anything about life. What are we going to do, Mum? You'd best ring Jan and warn him. Go on! Telephone. Margareta! Watch out! Watch out! Are you crying? Obviously. Daddy's on his way with a riding crop. - Why do I need a riding crop? - He could murder you! - Further me? - No, MURDER you! Murderous? If he hits you, hit him back. NO!... You mustn't hit my dad. - That's him. - The doorbell... I'll call you back. See you. What the... What's that? A pistol. It belonged to my great great great grandfather... ...who was a pirate captain. Let me have a look. It's loaded. I can tell you what this is. It's a French flintlock... from the 16th century. Look... 12mm calibre. The butt is pear tree... No, plum tree. Silver fittings... and look here... - Look at that. - Fascinating! Come on in! I was to see a young gentleman here... He's not there. I know that for sure. Look at this... Fleur de lys... royal crown... The chain insignia! This pistol has belonged to a French king. Probably Henri II It's worth its weight in gold. He still hasn't rung. He promised he's ring. Calm down my pet. Are YOU calm? What if they kill each other? You'd be a widow. But I... Do you have a key? Yes. So get moving! I'm glad I found this place. Pass that down! Fantastic! What's your name, by the way? Jan Froman. Yes... it's coming back now... Jan... my name's Viktor. Jan! This is an extremely valuable object. How much do you think...? - What are you winking at? - No, I misunderstood... Yes... well... just let me tell you... If you learn something, learn it from the beginning. I shall now relate to you the history of hand guns. Gunpowder was invented by an old monk. "Dear Jan, there' food in the oven, the gas is on. I left before 1632" "Gustav II's death has always given me a pain." Goodness! all my favorites! All that's missing is 'Janson's Temptation' simmering in the oven. Don't tell me...! I'd be happy if my daughter Margareta found someone like you. Nothing's impossible. Unfortunately it is impossible. She's fallen in love with some cad . Surely yo exaggerate? He probably knows nothing at all about the history of the hand gun. My weapons collection is quite enormous! But when a man gets pensioned off, he has to economise. Smaller accommodation and so on... it's a sad chapter in one's life. I happen to own some properties. What would you say to museum in the new city development. What are you suggesting? Brother! Brother! All we need is for you to be a naval officer. No, but my great great grandfather was a privateer captain under Lasse. Congratulations! Froman the Pirate, eh? Froman? His chest is in the attic... It should contain some weapons. Then what the hell are we standing here for? Let's set to it. It's like shoveling snow! Here they are. Heavy as lead! No, it can't be true! A gun? An arquebus for use at sea. You are my best friend! just name your price for this weapon. I'll make you a swap. Anything you want. But not the royal steamer, that'd be too much. Margareta. Is it you? Yeah. We swap. But we keep this as a family secret, OK? Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
