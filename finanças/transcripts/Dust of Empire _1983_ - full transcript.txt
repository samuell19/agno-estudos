WHEN THE ROCKS STARE AT THE HORIZON FOR A LONG TIME, THEY BECOME "WAITING STONES." WHO CAN KNOW IF THEY A FROM THE SKY OR ARE BORN FROM THE EARTH? That's enough for this one, sister. We'll go home. We're not going home, Sergeant. We are staying here. "We're not leaving Sergeant, we're staying here." No, no! That's it. We scouted the terrain a bit. We will go back. There will be no next time, Sergeant. There are signs in life that you must know how to read at the right time. "There will be no next time, Sergeant." You were saying, Sergeant? Sergeant Tamisier. Tam-Tam. You couldn't… Sergeant Tam-Tam. Like a tom-tom. So you prefer gold. If it can make you happy… Sergeant Tam-Tam. It's not a question of pleasure, sister. It's for the habit. In this country, habits matter. And especially here. You have to go through the right door. Because it alone leads to life. Well, me too. Happy are those who find it, Sergeant. You cannot understand. We'd have arrived ages ago if we had taken the normal route. With the car. In addition, we would have been received like the wise men. When I think I know a little cushy place behind the lines… With a chapel, fan, altar boys, all the shops… There is even a bar. "Sir, the piano is wearing out." Hey, boy! Boy! Down here! Down here, come closer! It's the Westerners. They said at the infirmary that no one survived. You have to help me. Tell my wife that I'm still alive, okay? What? You can't speak? Can you give me the kite? Don't move. What's your name, little man? What is your name? Where is your village? Is your village far away? Leave it to me, Sergeant. Sergeant. With this child to guide me, I no longer need you. You can go back, if you want. That's it, okay. There are enough martyrs. But yes, sister, let's go. Where are you going? Hello sir! Hello madam! Hello sir, hello madam! Please come in. Come in. Please let me. Let me go make some tea. Thank you very much, sir. We've showed up a bit unexpectedly. It is very cool here. Do have some chrysanthemum tea. Sergeant? I think you are being offered chrysanthemum tea. It's delicious, I love it. This cup is yours. Thank you. Hey, sister, it smells a bit like the cemetery, huh? Chrysanthemum, scene of the dead… It's more sensible than green tea in this weather, Sergeant. Nine… Ten… Ten. It's right on the dot. This is exactly what I need. Sergeant! Why the hell are you here, in God's name! Stand up! The whole village is showing up. Hello, ma'am. Hello Mr. French Officer. Hello. Hello, sir. Let me introduce myself. I am the French interpreter of the village. Well, anyway. It's sister, not ma'am, sister. I am Colonel Tamisier. Colonel? Five gallons! This Westerner is such a liar. Officer… Sergeant only! I introduce myself. - At ease. - At your service! - Sister, you decide, we do it here? - Sergeant. There you go! This noise is the welcome rain! Sir, the Western man is asking for your permission to have a meeting here with the villagers. Meeting for what? He says he's selling something. Selling what? Is it dangerous? Dangerous? Let me ask him. It's dangerous? No, no. He says it's not dangerous at all, sir. If it's not dangerous, then okay. You invite them to stay. Yes, yes. He says there is no problem. You are welcome here. Thank you. Thank you, sir. The house is very spacious, you are welcome to stay here. The house is spacious. It's not a problem at all. Please stay, sir. Please stay, ma'am. Come, Sergeant. Come on. We'll round up the people. Goodbye, sir. Alright. This… Here. What's your name? Tu. Okay. Hold on. Okay, you set it up for me over there. You like that, huh? Hold on. Here, look. Tu, can you tell her not to touch the cabinet? Let's go, man. Let's pedal a bit. Ma'am? Can you switch places? Is it possible? - Sergeant. - Yes. We have to change places if I understood correctly. What's going on? Why, what's up, I can't sit here? - Fine. - Sergeant Tamisier. Yes? Yes, Tam-Tam, sister, Tam-Tam. It's shot. I'm coming, sister. What's the matter now? Are we not good here? Eh? What is the old man saying? He doesn't want you to touch the wardrobe. We agreed, sister, we do this on the closet. And so what's the problem? Well… Well, this wardrobe is very nice. Sir? Yes, yes… For this, we need a flat surface. And square, sister, very important. Young man? Translate, please. Try to make him understand that it's not to annoy him. Stretch it somewhere else, or it'll ruin my cabinet. Tell her for me. Why don't she stretch it elsewhere instead of using my cabinet? Sorry for bothering you, Sergeant. No problem. Wait, I'm coming. Thank you. Tell me, sister. Is it true that you were in couture in Paris? Who told you that? I don't know, the officers, everyone. Our past no longer belongs to us, Sergeant. So, is it true? Have you had a heartbreak? Did you go bankrupt or what? If you were a nurse, I would understand, but here… I made myself poor. You must like that, right? Because the rich, I sense that you don't like them very much. I can feel it. You know, I was a drummer in Paris in a small musette band. So the rich, the poor, I saw them on the dance floor, there are times when they like to fraternize, believe me. Come on, Sergeant. Take care of the device. Well, watch out, peepers, you're pedaling a little bit! Where did the kid go? Come on, let's go. Move over, sister. Can you turn off the lamp, please? MARY AND JOSEPH GET TO BETHLEHEM Look at Mary. It's incredible. Mary. "You have found favor with God, you will give birth to a son to whom you will give the name of Jesus!" "But what am I going to do since I don't know a man?" "Hey, angel. Don't worry, Mary, the Holy Spirit will protect you… Nothing is impossible for God." And come on, here's the finished product! He is born, the divine child And now… The Wedding at Cana! Well, sister, I think we're ready for the miracle, huh. Maybe I'll stretch the screen a bit on the dresser. Alright, now go get your friends from the village. They too will like to hear the word of Christ. They will be welcome. Can I go and call the villagers? Yes, you go ahead. Sir! The child forgot his kite. No. It doesn't matter. I will give it back to him myself. It would get wet for nothing. Go ahead. And I hope there will be little canoes ready for all. Damn it! Hey, sister. Did you see? So he collects dust. Some are Camembert lids, but this is dust. It means "fire." You know things, Sergeant. Ah, that surprises you, huh? Did your girlfriends teach you all this? Habit, sister, habit. I lived with a Vietnamese girl. She is dead. Sorry, Sergeant. - No harm done. - Sergeant! Sergeant, Sergeant! Sergeant, Sergeant! Ma'am, Ma'am! What? What's the matter? They… They are coming. Damn it! For God's sake! - Attack… - Calm down! Attack! Alright, let's pack up! Ma'am! Ma'am! I've had it up to here! It's fast! I don't want to go… I'm staying here, Sergeant. Enough with the martyrdom! I'm not stopping you, Sergeant! I'm staying here! What do you mean "I'm staying here"? I have orders to take you to camp! It's my job. I'm taking you back. Where are you going? You were sneaking away, very funny! Leave it alone! You were going to tell your friends, huh? Wait, Sergeant… Wait! Come on, let's go, sister! We have to hurry! Go ahead if you want, Sergeant! What? The wind is very strong. It's very dangerous. You, don't leave! We'll take care of it, you stay here! Too, too dangerous! Jesus, see? Protect us all! And my goddamn car? Oh damn it! My poor car! There is an adage that says, "Overflowing water, you don't pick up with your hands." Yeah, that's it. - Thanks for the advice. - I don't fear the enemy. And Heaven will help you, huh? I have no fear of the executioner's fury. For God's sake! Attack! One, two. Turn to the right. I will watch them. Two, three of them. How do you do it? Habit, sister. Habit. Attack! Go ahead. Sergeant. If he comes to take us… I don't want blood! Do you hear me sergeant? I don't want blood! Seems you can't wait to kill yourself, huh? What do you think? They knew we were here all along. Young man. He is the gentleman who protects us. This man? He is highly respected by the Viet Minh. He buries the dead. The ashes. It is the ashes of the fighters. Sergeant! Sergeant! Sergeant! For God's sake! Come on! No! Damn it! All this dust! And you! Your tie! Hey, you! You're very handsome, huh! Mister four! Show your little tie. 100% Marseille nylon. Well, we're off to a good start, mate. Yes, yes, Sergeant… Get out of here! This is not rainwater. Then what is it? Why is the flood so high? It floods each time this year. It's not rain, my child. Is that so? River water. So there is no rainwater. What is he saying? It's not rainwater, Sergeant. So what is it, booze? He says it's water from the Black River. The dykes were blown up… Bombing! It's not rainwater. Are you sure? Sure, Sergeant. It's certain. It's river water. The river? This time we're done for, sister. Those idiots blew up the dikes. We'll end up drowning like rats. The Lord does not abandon his servants. Well, then a good little miracle, huh. Go ahead, quickly. Sergeant. You find miracles ridiculous because you close your heart. The people here are ready to hear the divine word. They have their spirits… their wandering souls. They ask only to suffer in faith. - He's hiding over here! - Stop! Careful! It's flammable! Move in! Hurry up! Did you hear, sister? There's a wandering soul out there saying, "Amen!" Come see! Young man. Here. You who speak our language, there is a message in these scriptures for each of us. What's written on it? The water erased everything. What did the child tell you? Translate what remains for me. "Waiting game. Loyalty and transformation." It says "Villa of Roses" too, young man. Ah yes! So, sister? Is the Gospel catching on? For God's sake, to the post! Game… Waiting game. Sergeant! Come on, they're going to barricade us! Sergeant! Sergeant! Do you know about the waiting stone? To hang around your neck? It must also be a well-known legend here. It's the story… It's the story of a man and a woman who got married without knowing they were brother and sister. The war had separated them since childhood. One day the man discovers a small scar that was made on his sister long ago. Children always run away! The woman, who is too faithful, is waiting for him! Waiting and waiting! Sit down! Grab this! We're going to barricade this damn door! Sir… number! Damn it. Poor Mother Mary. Haven't you had enough of this? But you still have snow. Here, sister. Can you at least swim? Yes. Yes, Sergeant. I can swim. Hey, sister. In your collection, were there swimsuits? I forbid you! These futile thoughts drive us apart as soon as I met you. Listen to this, son. Tamisier Antoine, posthumous medalist. - Sergeant! - Excursion specialist! Projected over 100 times the miracle of Tiberias in which our Lord Jesus walked on water. Died in honor on the field shouting, "Crap, I'm sinking!" Makes you laugh, huh? You too. You will soon see how much fun you will have. It's so cold. It hurts so much. Good old MAS 36. You stole this from one of our unsuspecting guys, right? This man asks only to die in peace, Sergeant. What's wrong? Sir… - What, what is it? - The people… The people… Well, what the people? Come on, don't wear yourself out, baby. What? What's going on, sister? What did you see? I saw him, Sergeant. The god of war… It's time to choose your friends. Choose them well. You will have to live with them. Hey! Give the nun this. I'm going. Get down! Stand up! Get to work! Come on! Come on! Come on! Alright! Come on, come on, come on! Come on! Hey! Wake up, everyone! Wake up, everyone! Wake up! The men next to you are trying to escape. Are you trying to escape? Can you hear me? Hey, can you hear me? - My name is Đạo. - Don't say it. - I was arrested at the Battle of Binh Gia. - Hurry up. What do you want? I need to tell my wife I'm alive. Where is your wife? Saigon. Yes, Saigon. What's your message? Four verses of Lament of the Soldier's Wife. "Alas! What could I, with a magic wand, to shorten the distances. Why can I not meet a fairy who would help me make a shawl, a bridge! It may be that my heart will turn to stone. No longer with jade tears that I shall mount the tower." What is the address? My family works at Villa of Roses. May Buddha bless you. Search this bush. Search everything. No, over there! But do you often visit your grandparents? The nuns bring you to visit your grandparents. I don't like the nuns. Don't say stupid things like that. The nuns are very kind, you hear me? The nuns take care of me all the time. - You hear me? - The nuns suck up to the Western soldiers. Don't say such nonsense. Go, my child, go quickly. Go straight to the train gate, there are a lot of patrols here. Go straight to that train gate. Ask the gatekeeper. He is one of us. Go quickly. I need to give a message to the prisoner's wife. Where. Where is she? Saigon. What is the message? Hurry up. "Alas! What could I, with a magic wand, do to shorten the distances. Why can't I meet a fairy who would help me make a shawl, a bridge! It may be that my heart will turn to stone. No longer with jade tears that I shall mount the tower." Where is she? She works for a French family. Come on, go, son. Hurry up. May the heavens protect him. Thông! Listen to me. Here. Listen. You have to remember, you hear? "Villa Des Roses." - "Villa Des Roses." - Villa of Roses. Villa of Roses. -"Alas! What could I, with a magic wand, -"Alas!

Let's go, everyone. Study hard, do you hear me? Don't get into trouble. Remember what Grandma told you, okay? SAIGON - 90 MILES Hey Mr. Hoang! This is a road here, damn it. There are pagodas for that, it's not here for nothing, go get out! What are you saying, sir? What are you saying, sir? One minute please, one minute please. What a miserable sight to see… Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! SAIGON - 78 MILES Where are you going? I'm going up the tower. Go ahead. I give you this. Well, this is so beautiful. I'll be leaving now. BARBE STREET CHASSELOUP LAUBAT STREET A green mouse Was running through the grass I grabbed it by the tail I showed it… I grabbed it by the tail I showed it to some men, the men said Dip it in water… Don't forget to close bedroom shutters. And then… It will make like a snail, all hot! Françoise, I mean, let's hurry. Come on. Did you see the little tan case? Yes, yes, don't worry. We must leave. Sir. Sir, where is the Villa of Roses?

That's Notre Dame over there. - We're there! - Yes, finally! Perfect, look! We're there! PARIS QUAY 2 Don't move. The restoration of peace in Indochina was of very great importance in itself. - But it was a preliminary respite. - Come in. Mathieu, don't touch, your father will be angry! Mathieu, who asked you to touch this? Come on, go quickly, go to your room. I told you to go to your room! Go away. - Communication in Washington… - Come on. There is also the stability of the military opposition in Kenya, increased stability thanks to the success of the concentration operations, while we will be working in Geneva. In case of failure, negotiations. The first and heavy task, be ready to tackle the immense work of reconstruction that awaits us, all together. And now, it's time to go. France Inter. In this international news, we will go from the Barka affair to the death of Mr. Breton… Among these interests, the one that obviously dominates all the others is peace in Asia and consequently in the world. In Vietnam, the war has become all the more banal, yesterday, like today, American planes bombarded the suburbs of Hanoi and Haiphong. Still Vietnam. For good reason, the Viet Cong's lightning offensive throughout South Vietnam and in Saigon itself will no doubt have profound repercussions on what follows. The South Vietnam National Liberation Front is the true representative of the legitimate aspirations of the South Vietnamese people. Hello. "No, three times no," is Mrs. Binh's response to President Nixon. The GRP representative at the Paris conference was categorical upon his arrival at the 87th meeting of the Paris conference. Thirty years. Thirty years of war ended this morning with the capture of Saigon. Saigon renamed, the GRP moved to Ho Chi Minh. More than a million dead in 30 years, the war is over, what's the future for Vietnam? Granny is a vanilla girl. Bang, bang! You are dead. What have you broken now? Camille, come here. Come here! You too! It's been there for 25 years, what will grandfather say? Go on, disappear! Hello? Mathieu? Françoise. What's going on, is it serious? No, no, it's not serious. I already said I didn't want disturbing during the meeting. Hurry. Listen, do you remember the trip? - What trip? - The boat back. What about it? Remember the singer? What singer? I just found the little piece of paper we got. Do you know what was written on that paper? "Villa of Roses" was on it. Villa of Roses, do you understand? Less and less. Did this paper fall from the piano, yes or no? What's the point? The point is that the pianist had a paper with the name of the house in Saigon without having ever gone. Wow! Why did you cook the rice so soon? Remember to stop by and eat! I want a Mrs. Tina. Mrs. Tina is gone. Hey, do you know where the lady went? And you don't know where she went? She left to celebrate at the Mutuality center. The Tet holiday. The Vietnamese holiday. HAPPY NEW YEAR VIETNAMESE TET MUTUALITY CENTER …is asked to come up on set to rehearse. They have it too, but not as pretty. - They also have white. - Nice! Oh, take the orange one. What we made is ugly. This is other people's product. There is white, too. It's pretty. White is usually worn for dancing. Think of dancers. Increase a little bit more, straight up. Here, I found this at home. And I think it's for you, because it's written in Vietnamese. VIETNAM AIRLINES VIETNAM AIRLINES Bicycle here. Hey, miss! Coming through! Hey, hey. Make way, please! Come in. Come in! Hurry up! Sister, how old are you this year? Twenty. Did you come back from France? How did you know? Wherever you go, you ask around. Sister, do you know this rock? During the resistance war against the French people called this stone the waiting stone. Do you know the story of Vọng Phu? They often use this place as a meeting point, for those who joined the resistance. But that was a long time ago. In the anti-American era, people also forgot. I often pass by here too. But doesn't it look like a woman? Just like a certain woman waiting for her husband. She waited for a long time until she withered, and finally turned to stone. Subtitle translation by: Anthony Hoang
