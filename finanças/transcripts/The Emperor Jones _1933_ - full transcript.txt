Gentlemen! Gentlemen! In your chairs, brothers and sisters. Now, I propose that we devote the closing prayer to a faithful member of our flock who is leaving us tonight, to fill a position of great importance in foreign parts. I refer to our brother, Brutus Jones. Will you bow your heads in prayer? Almighty everlasting God, we the people of Hezekiah Baptist Church is gathered together for the purpose of giving into your keeping our brother, Brutus Jones. Like the prodigal son in the story, he's-a setting out on a far journey. But this boy ain't like the prodigal son. He ain't shiftless, and he ain't worthless. Oh, Lord, he ain't puffed up. And he ain't vainglorious, Lord. Mm mm, honey. You sure is wonderful in them clothes. Yeah. I suppose these clothes is something to look at back here, honey. Where I been while I've been training for the job, you would notice 'em. Well, you ought to see them New York girls on Lenox Avenue. Them gals is fast, I bet. Switching theirselves to catch the men. But honey, you wouldn't look at none of them fast gals whiles you away from home, would you? They ain't none of 'em as pretty in the face like mine gal. And that prodigal son, he takes the inheritance for his pappy gives him, and he spend it on the fast life. But not this boy, Lord. No, Jesus, not this boy. And the prodigal son is a liar, and the truth ain't in him! But not this boy, Lord. He got the truth, Lord! You know I looks up, and there's the Capitol building, looking like a palace on the hill. And the big front door opens, and the President of the United States marches down the avenue with a band before and a band behind. And he comes right up to my car, and he says, just as natural, "Well, Brutus, you sure is much of a man. And I, for one, wants to compliment you on landing a job." Honey, they're singing the closing song at the church. We's got time. Jeff's train's going to pick me up at the water tank. But you know they's waiting to see you before you go. I sure hate to leave my gal. Would you hold my hat, honey? Hello, Suzanna. Hello, Brutus. - Hello, brother. - How you doing? Fine, thank you. There's your train, son. Goodbye, folks. Goodbye, brother. Take care of yourself. Goodbye! Goodbye, Mama. Goodbye, Here she is. Come on, Jones. Here's my buddy. Honey, this is Jeff. Hello, sister. Make tracks, bo, cause we's riding right now. Come on. - All right. But this is too much! You is coming back, ain't you? Oh, sure I's coming back. You just get yourself a new dress with this, honey. You know, a red one. That's your style. And take care of yourself until I come back, now. Come on! All right, old boy. It's all right, honey. Take care of yourself. Don't worry. I'll be back very soon. Take care of yourself. Goodbye, honey! Goodbye Bye bye, honey! Bye bye! Shine 'em, boy. You done told 'em goodbye now. You going to stick to it? Sure, I is. Cause you big time from this on. Now, I suppose you think you know all there is about this job. Sure, didn't you done instruct me? Oh, just the rudimentary. Now we's going to take up the higher education. Finances. Yes, brother. And right here's where I estimates the profits for the run. Now, if you brushes a dime out of this, you's doing well. And number three here, boy, that's good for a half. What about this one? Number five. A whole section. That's a honeymoon couple. That's a natural. If you plays your hand right, it means the long green. Big money, eh? That's what I want to tell you about. You know, there's two kind of women that rides the Pullman. There's the kind that says, "Where you been, Porter?" That don't mean nothing but a tip. Then there's the kind that sings out, "Hello there, Jack Johnson!" And boy, that means money. The long green. Yeah. And I'm going to show you where to spend it. Everybody, meet my friend from South Carolina. Helen, meet Mr. Jones. Jones, meet Mr. Green. Gee, that's very strong. Come here, Marcella. Meet Mr. Jones. This is Marcella, Jones. Hello, big boy. I got your fish and rice all ready for ya. You know, I'm from South Carolina, myself. You told me you was from Georgia. Told me Lynchburg. Marcella sure had a busy ma. She done born her in every state south of the line. This is my New York home, bo, and you'll always find me here. Oh, Marcella, where's Undine? I don't know. She was around here somewhere. Didn't know I was coming in, eh? Honeying up to my gal, eh? Take it easy. Don't do that. Don't do that, son. Not inside of my house. You ain't gonna send me to jail. Uh uh. Y'all go ahead and dance! There she is. Undine, meet Mr. Jones. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Jones. Wanna dance? Sure. Go ahead. You're my buddy, ain't ya? How you like the city, big boy? I like it fine now. Coming back soon? Soon as the train'll bring me. I'll be here. Honey, I sure glad to see you. I get to missing you more and more during these long runs. You know, you oughtn't ask me to come here to meet you. I been afraid. Afraid a what? Um, you know. Jeff. He's a bad actor over me. Well, you ain't got nothing to be afraid of. I can handle that little two-bits porter. You oughta throw him over, anyhow. Then it'll be just you and me. Sometimes I wonders. Wonders what? If we gonna last. You ain't got nothing to worry about, honey. But you ain't heard the good news yet. I been transferred to the president's private car. Aw, that ain't nothin'. Why, Jeff said you don't make no tips on that job. That's why he didn't take it. There you are. That's the difference between me and Jeff. He can't see no bigger than two bits. Me? Why, I just be steppin' to my own class on that private car. Harrington, if there is no leak, we stand to clean up millions. That's the idea. Good night. Good night. Good night, Jones. Good night, sir. Anything on your mind, Jones? I's awful worried about that merger. Sure would be bad for us if that news got out. Us? Hm. How long have you been with me, Jones? Six weeks, sir. Learning fast Jones. Almost too fast. Got any money, Jones? I got about $300 in the bank. All right. You're in the pool for $300. Thank you, sir. And Jones, I would rather you didn't leave the car until Sunday. Two days solitary. But it'll be worth it, right? Yes, sir. And Jones, when we get back to New York, it might be a good idea for you to go back on your old run. There's more room for big men in Georgia. Yes, sir. Boy, you sure was born to wear that oyster front. Where'd you get such a good fit? Well, the boss and me talk it over. And he sent me to his tailor. He said, Jones, you got a position to live up to now. And you can't afford to be careless in your attire. You and Mr. Harrington must be getting mighty thick. Well, we just pulled off a little deal together. I gave him some valuable advice. And he said, Jones, you're learning fast. You're getting big. Then he takes me into partnership. But ain't you going back on the Pullman no more? Oh, I'll stick by the job for a few more runs. But things don't seem to be going quite right on that old run of mine. And the boss asked me to drop down that way, straighten them out. Well, I guess since you'll be down that way, you'll probably drop in the White House. Well, that's an idea. Look here, what are you trying to do? Kid me? - Me? Kid you? Boy, you're a scream. "Jones. You're gettin' big. You're learnin' fast. Then he takes me into partnership." Come clean, big boy. Where'd you get that money, in a crap game? Go laugh some more. You done laughed yourself right off of my payroll. Oh, honey, sweetheart, I didn't mean it. I was only kidding. No, you's too funny to live with. Any woman's baggage what gets heavier and heavier the longer you totes 'em. You got to change 'em to keep traveling light. Here's $40, and goodbye. So you was all set to do this before you come in, eh? Through is through. You heard me. And you can go back to Jeff. He still thinks there ain't nobody like his Undine. Yeah. Well, you ain't the first man that's gone down and out thinking everybody was a fool. I got eyes, even if Jeff ain't. And you can tell that polecat Belle La Due, if she wants to keep on trying to look like Garbo, she better stay out of my way. Slim, sister! Well, if it ain't the old big timer in from the West. Hello, Jeff. Hello, Undine. Undine, meet Miss La Due. I've known Belle since before she straightened her hair and when she went with Johnson. Where is he now, Belle? Still in jail? Undine, where is your manners? I'm just trying to talk so that the polecat can understand me. Come on, baby. Let's dance. What's the matter with you tonight, Undine. Now, I don't like you acting sore to my pal. Your pal. Yeah. Don't make me laugh. Why, he's been biting you in the back for a year. What do you mean? I mean, when I get finished with Belle, he ain't gonna have much left to love. Oh, you dirty... Hey you! Stop that! Come on. I's travelling light. Number eight's his point. Come on, you nits. Get back and give me room, will ya? What's the matter, Jeff? I never saw you in such a mood. Never mind the lip. Get these nits back away from the table. Hey, fellas, come on. Back up. Give him a chance. We ain't in his way. Shoot! Hah! On the line, you nits. Eighter from Decatur. Beaver dice. Big dick. Who is that singing? Is that you, Lily pie? Yes.

Who wants any part of these four sawbucks? I makes my point. Let the dice bring on misery. Let him hear 'em chatter. Six-four me, dice. Six-ace. The man went away. You know, why don't you get up off the table? Can't you see your coat sleeve's stopping my dice? What are you talking about? Can't I make a bet? Here, old boy, you win a dime. Here you are, Jeff. Mark mine. Who's the next shooter? 85 cents I shoot. 85 cents the lady shoots. Bring your bet here. Your cushions favor me. Let 'em roll. She's faded. Twenty the dice do.

What's the matter? Put the dice down. Crooked, huh? Well, if they is crooked, they stands just like him. And here's where I straighten them both... Jeff! Come here, Jones. Open it up. Open it up. Asleep, eh? Well, I'll learn him how to run away. Wake him up. If I lay my hands on that boy, the Lord will strike me dead. Won't take orders, eh? Dump it, old boy. Let 'er go! Dolly. Let me in, quick. Dolly, honey, you hear me? Who dat? Brutus, honey. Let me in, quick. Oh, Lord, I'm glad to see you. Oh, but you's in trouble. Listen, Dolly, you got to move fast. Get me a file, a change of clothes, especially shoes. But you's cut! Hurry, honey. I've got to leave the country. Say, where is this tub stopping next? Kingston. Get there tomorrow. Ain't we stopping on these little islands on the way? Boy, this no local. This running express. Kingston. Quite a big city, eh? Now you're shouting. They got everything. Dancehalls, gals. They got telegraph? Cable, you mean, big boy? Sure, they got cable. What's that little island with the white port we've been coming on this afternoon? That's one of them there little nigger islands. But nobody bother go that place. Ain't nothing there but trouble. Trouble is my buddy. Say, bo, watch my door. I ain't gonna be long. OK. Trouble, here I come. Who there? Who that? What you want, buddy? All right, all right. I'm coming. Your Highness, Mr. Smithers is waiting to see you. Show the gentleman in. Send Mr. Smithers in. Well, your excellency, the good has come. And I brought you a few samples. First class, just like I said they'd be. Now, here's the figures. $400 cash for the lot. Oh no, I got the contract this time. The contract, he said, $300. Contract? Well, that's just the blooming point. You see, uh, here it says, "except for an act of God." Now, then, there ain't the like of that consignment within 300 miles. And the next boat don't get here for two months. Now, ain't that an act of God, so help me? Where you get that trash from? On the beach. Where you come from? Come to make trouble on my island, filthy swine. Lock him up and throw him on the first boat out. I'll take this blooming nigger off your hands for you, your highness. Here. Here, five silver dollars for him, lock, stock, and barrel. What do you say, now? Is it a trade? Good. Here, wait a minute. Here. Bring him here. I want to have a talk with him. That's all right, he belongs to me. So that's what it is, my lad, eh? What they calls in the States a bad nigger, eh? A killer, what? With the law on your trail and the blooming gallows waiting for you around the next corner, what? Look here, white man. I comes and I goes. And that's my business. Oh, that's the kind of a nigger you are, eh? Not afraid to stand right up to your betters and tell them what's what? You wouldn't be afraid of a bit of a fight, neither, would you? When I fights, there's something in it. I never fight on an empty belly. Yeah, well supposing your belly was full and you had a chance to get back at the stinking heathen what threw you out? What would you say then? No use talking, white man. All right. Now, you get your rum and your eats. But you don't get a stinking penny, because I'm a trader, see? I ain't no bloomin' missionary. And if anybody worries you, you just tell them you belong to Mr. Smithers. I belongs to Mr. Smithers. What's that? Ginger. What's that? What's that? Cocoa. What's that? - Ginger. - Ginger? What's that? Coffee. Coffee, ging... Well, this ain't regular. But maybe the dice will do. Now, they goes first to the gentleman with the Rolls Royce. All right, talk to him, bo. What I say? Fever in the South. Fever south. Eighter from Decatur. Eighter from cater. Big dick. - Big dick. - Hah! Hah. Well, shoot, man. Don't you know "hah" means shoot? Boy, the whole pile goes to the gentleman with the Rolls Royce. Well, all right. Gather it in. All yours, buddy. I'll be dressed up here in a minute. I'm going after that hat. And I'm rogue. Natural. Let me have it boy. Now, Quacko, what do you say? This whole pile to get that Rolls Royce. Hah. The house is rolling. Now, come on, you galloping dominoes. Come home to papa, and let 'er ride. Hah! Nine is the gentleman's point. Come on, eighter from Decatur. Come on. Hah! Even us out, baby. Hah! The gentleman made his point. Ah, the team is mine, Quacko. That's tough luck. Better luck next Saturday night. Me play woman for oxen. Oh, no. Women is women. And Brutus Jones is through. Well, I'll see you boys next week. Look 'em over. So long, Quacko. I'll see you later. I wonder what the blazes is keeping that black ape. Whoa. Boy. Whoa. Here, where do you think you're going? Oh, good morning, Mr. Smithers. You works in here. Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Smithers, the boys back in the bush seems to like my methods. And I's figuring to open up a little tradin' business next door here. Cut my bleedin' throat, would you? After all I've done for you, too. Is that your idea of gratitude? Well, I's always ready to listen to reason. And while I'm unloading, if I was to hear anybody say something about a partnership... Coconut, pineapple, finefat chicken, all ready for the tooth. Raisins and new corn, coconut, pineapple, great big chicken, all ready for the tooth. Pineapple, big chicken ready for the tooth. How do you do, Mr. Smithers? How have you been? I'm sure glad to see you. How do you do? Why don't you come in and pay your bills? You know, everytime I rides up here through that jungle it gives me the creeps. Say, you notice they shut the gates after us? Looka here, white man, is your nerve slippin'? Well, I don't like it. If you had to recruit an army for him, why did you have to get such big blokes? Yes, them is fine niggers. I bet you they knows a man when they sees one. Well, if there's any trouble, you've only got yourself to blame. Saluting him and calling him General and... Well, now I tell you, Mr. Smithers. If there's any trouble, you just leave the General to me. Us niggers understand each other. Tell him Mr. Smithers. You know, you gotta be diplomatic. Take it easy. Mr. Smithers to see you, excellency. Show the gentleman in. Well, good day to you, your majesty. Well, well. Top hole, eh? Top hole. As fine a body of men as ever I clapped me peepers on. Eh, what, Jones? Right. Yeah, and well farmed, if I says it myself as fitted 'em out. Eh? What? Well, General, you got a swell army. And I reckons when you figure how little it's costing you, makes you feel mighty proud. Send in the treasurer. This my treasurer. Tell the General the truth now. Does you know how to figure? Yes, your highness. Now, you see, I got a figure. Produce the contract. Your bill, Mr. Smithers. Yeah, well, here you are, your excellency. Now, then, there was 100 uniforms at $5. It's $1,000. It was 100 rifles at $5, $1,000. One cannon was $500. And the ammuni... well, it adds up to $4,000, your excellency. What does the treasurer report? It seems to me that there might be a little error. Uh, well, here... here, let me look at it. Yeah, we all make mistakes now and again. Yes, there is a mistake. I seen it all along. It's $5,000. There you is, cap'n. Check that off and tell it to the boss. Fire. [LAUGHTER Fire again. Plenty of guns. Don't you all knows I's got a charm? Takes a silver bullet to kill Brutus Jones. My turn now, General. Company. Attention! Take this bush nigger and throw him out of here. I'm boss here now. All of you, get out of here and wait. Them what I wants to stay will hear from me in an hour. Smithers, you wait. I wants to confer with you. Well, blimey if you ain't pulled it off. You have got a nerve. Nerve and brain. I calls it stinking luck, having that nigger miss you twice at 10 feet. Pick up that gun. Break it. Blanks. Blimey, how... You remember when Quacko got drunk in town last night and I takes care of his gun while he sleeps it off? Well, that's what I call brains. Whew. This place smells more like a chain gang dump than a palace. Say, Smithers, how you likes the contract for doing this dump over? Now you're talking. And don't make the mistake of thinking you're dealing with an ignorant bush nigger. I gives you an audience tomorrow. Hey, and bring along them fashion sheets that I gets last summer. And then I want mirrors. Plenty of 'em. And remember, Smithers, red's my color. I always had a special taste for red. Mr. President. No. King Brutus. No, somehow that don't make enough noise. Smithers, cigarette. Light. Smithers, you have just had an audience with the Emperor Jones. My sash. Watch that foot. Give me a drink. My coat. Brush it off. Tell Smithers I'll sees him here. Clear out, all of you. Your majesty. Well, Smithers, what's on your mind this morning? Well, you remember what I told you when you slapped that last tax on coffee, that you were cutting your own bloomin' throat. Sure, I remember. What of it? There was a riot down in the village last night. And your tax collector got beaten up so his own mother wouldn't know him. That's old stuff. My army's got them niggers already. And I'm going to get 'em down before the whole court this morning. They all need a lesson. Too late to give 'em a lesson now, my lad. You've got 'em squeezed dry. Looka here. When I take this job, what I tells you? I says, three years for my cleanup, don't I? Well, we's got six months to go. Them's my arrangements. And I ain't gonna change. I suppose you get your money hiddent away safe, eh? I sure has. And it's banked in a foreign land where there ain't no chain gangs and no jim crow and nobody can't get it except me. In six months, I walks out on this nigger circus. And from then on, I's top dog. Top dog, eh? Looka here, white man. There's little stealing like you does, and there's big stealing like I does. For little stealing, they get you in jail sooner or later. But a big stealing? They makes you emperor and puts you in a hall of fame when you croaks. Well, all I know is that it's a wise gambler that knows when to quit. Looka here, white man. You think I ain't still got these niggers like that? You think when I crack the whip, they don't jump through? All right, I shows you I'll summon the court. His majesty is on the throne. Summon the court. Archduke and Duchess of Manhattan. Marquis and Marchioness of Newark. Marquis and Marchioness of Baton Rouge. Lord and Lady of Baltimore. Lord and Lady Richmond. And all points in his majesty's kingdom, north, south, east, and west. And Mr. Smithers. Bring in the prisoners. So yous the niggers what takes upon yourself to start a roughhouse and beat up an officer of the crown? Well, I see I been too easy on you niggers. Now I'm going to show you who's boss around here. Lieutenant. Take them niggers in the courtyard and give 'em 50 lashes a piece and lock 'em up. I said lock 'em up! Forward march. Captain! Take your company to the five-mile village and burn it off the face of the Earth. Everything! Understand? Right face. Forward march! March! Who dare whistle that way in my palace? Who dare wake up the emperor? I'll get the hides frayed off some of you niggers, sure. It was me whistled to you. I got news for you. Oh, it's you, Mr. Smithers. What news you got to tell me? Where's all your court? The generals and the cabinet ministers and all? Oh, they mostly run the minute I closes my eyes... drinking rum, talking big down the town. How come you don't know that? Ain't you sousing with 'em most every day? Well, I got you in my business and I... Your business. Blimey, when you landed here, you didn't have no high and mighty airs. Talk polite, white man. Talk polite, do you hear me? I'm boss here now. Is you forgotten? It's all right. No harm meant, old sop. Well, I accept your apology. What I was then is one thing, and what I is now is another. I wasn't afraid to hire you that time after you broke jail in the States. No, you didn't have no excuse to look down on me for that. You been in jail yourself more 'n worse. That's a lie! Who told you that fairy story? There's some things I ain't got to be told. I can see 'em in folks' eyes. Well, from what I've been told, it ain't safe for a black to kill a white man in the States. You mean lynchings scare me? Well, I'll tell you, Smithers. Maybe I does kill one white man back there. Maybe I does. And maybe I kills another right here before long if he don't look out. Here, you think I'd peach on you? Not me. I'm your friend, ain't I? Sure you is. And you'd better be. And to show you that I'm your friend, I'll tell you that bit of news I was going to. Go ahead. Shoot the breeze. Must be mighty bad news from the happy way you look. Ain't noticed any of the servants or the guards around the place this morning, I ain't. Oh, they all out in the garden, sleeping under the trees. All I gotta do is to ring that gong and they come flying. All right. Ring it now, and you'll see what I mean. Sure, I'll ring. The rotten ship is sinking, and the bloomin' rats have slung their hooks. Low-flung woods niggers. Well, I reckon overplayed my hand this once. A man can't take the pot on a bobtail flush all the time. Was I saying I'd sit in six months more? Well, I's changed my mind, then. I cashes in and resign the job of emperor right this minute. Well, blimey you're a cool bird and no mistake. No use fussing. When I know the game's up, I kisses it goodbye without no long wait. They's all run off to the hills, ain't they? Yes. Lem was taking 'em, every man jack of 'em. Then the revolution is at the post. And the emperor better get his feet smoking up that trail. Going to look for your horse, ain't you? Well, you won't find it. They steals the horses first thing. Well, then I hoofs it. Feet, do your duty. 3:30. Sundown's at 6:30 or thereabout. Ho, I got plenty of time, make it easy. Yeah, well don't you be so blasted sure. You'll have to hustle to get to to that port in 12 hours, even if you knew the trails like bloomin' native. Looka here, white man, did you think I's a natural born fool? Why, I's gone out in that forest so many times, pretending to hunt, I know's it high and low like a book. I could find them trails with my eyes shut. And I got tin grub hid there under a big white stone where I can find it. Oh, I'll be at the edge of the forest by the time dark comes. Once in them woods, them niggers will never find me. Dawn tomorrow I reaches the coast and boards that French gun boat. I got to laugh at these fool black trash around here. It's so easy. Supposing something happens and they does nab you? I's got five lead bullets in this gun, good enough for common bush niggers. And after that, I's got this silver bullet left to cheat 'em outta getting me. I tells 'em when the time comes, I kills myself with it. That's because I'm the only man in the world big enough to get me. Then you had silver bullet made? Honest? Oh, I sure did. Here she be. Five lead bullets and a silver baby at last. Don't she shine pretty? Let me see. Keep your hands where they belong, white man. Blimey, you'd think I was a blasted thief. No, it ain't that. I know you're scared to steal from me. I ain't allowing nobody to touch this baby. She's my rabbit's foot. A sort of charm, eh? Blimey, you'll need all your bloomin' charms before long, so help me. What's that drumbeating for? For you! The blacks is having a war dance in the hills, working up their courage for they start after you. Let them. They'll sure need it. They're making all sorts of devil spells and charms against your silver bullet. Takes more than that to scare this chicken. Tonight, when it's pitch black in the forest, they'll be sending their pet devils and ghosts hounding after you. You'll find your bloomin' hair will be standing on end tomorrow morning. It's a mighty queer place, that forest is, even in daylight. You don't know what might happen there. It's that rotten still. Always sends the cold shivers down my back the minute I gets in it. Go along, white man. You ain't talking to this baby. What ghosts and got to do with me? Well, don't you know I was a member in good standing of the Baptist church? Let 'em try their heathen tricks. And the Baptist church done protect me. Land 'em all in hell. Yeah, you ain't paid much heed to your Baptist church down here, taking up with them bloomin' witch doctors. Oh, sure, I pretend. It don't get me nothing to do missionary work for the Baptist church. I's after the coin. And I lays my religion on the shelf for the time being. But I ain't got the time to waste no more fool talk with you. I'm going away this second. So long, white man. I'll see you in jail sometime, maybe. Not me, you won't. Here, you ain't going out this way, are you? You think I'd sneak out the back door like a common nigger? I's emperor yet, ain't I? And the Emperor Jones leaves the way he come. And that black trash don't dare stop him. Not yet, leastways. Listen to that roll call, will you? Must be a mighty big drum carry that far. Well, if they ain't no whole brass band to see me off, I sure got the drum part of it. So long, white man. Give my regards to any ghosts you meet. Here I is. In the nick of time, too. Sure, I's tuckered out, sure enough. Whew. That soft emperor job sure ain't no training for a long hike over that plain in the broiling sun. Bush niggers. A wonder they wouldn't get sick of beating that drum. Sound louder, seem like. When did they start in after me? Oh, sure, they miles and miles behind. What you getting fidgety about? You know what? Your belly's empty. That's what's the matter with you. Nothing but wind on your stomach. Course you feels diggety. Well, we eats right here and now. White stone, white stone. Where is you? Ah, here you is. I know this was the right place. Box of grub, come to me. Ain't here. Has I lost the place? There's another stone. Yes, that's it. Ain't here, neither. Grub, where is you? You ain't here. Has I got to go hungry in them woods all night? Can't tell nothing from them trees. Nothing around here look like I ever seen it before. I done lost the place sure enough. Mighty queer. Mighty queer. Woods, is you trying to put something over on me? Who that? Who that? What is you? Get away from me before I... They're gone. Yeah, that shot fix 'em. Oh, it was only a little animal. Little wild pigs, I reckon. They maybe rooted out your grub and eat it. Sure, you fool nigger. What you think they is, hants? You give the game away when you fired that shot. Them niggers'll hear that for certain. Get in, nigger. What you scared at? Ain't nothing there but the trees. Get in there. The moon's rising. Did you hear that, nigger? Get more light from this out, and you sees where you's going. Cheer up. From now on you has a snap. Whew. It's warm. And that's a fact. How long I been making tracks in these here woods? Feel like forever. This am a long night for you, your majesty. Majesty. There ain't much majesty about this baby now. Never mind. It's all a part of the game. This night come to an end like everything else. You gets there safe and has that bank roll in your hands, then you laughs at all this. What you singing for, you poor nigger? Want all the world to hear you? Hear that old drum. Sure gets nearer from the sound. They're packing it along with 'em. Time for me to move. What's the little queer, clickety sound I hear? Sound like... sound... it sounds like some nigger were shootin' crap. Time I beats it quick when I get them notes. Who there? Who that? Is that you, Jeff? Jeff, I'm sure mighty glad to see you. But they told me you done died from that cut I gives you. How you come to be here, nigger? Ain't you going to look up? Can't you speak to me? Is you... is you a hant? Nigger. I killed you dead once. Has I got to kill you again? You take it then. He's gone, anyway, hant or no hant. That shot fixed him. It's getting nearer. He's coming fast, and here I is, shooting shots to let him know just where I is. Glory. I's got to run. I'm melting with heat from running and running and running. Damn, this here coat like a straightjacket. That's better. Now I can breathe. I gets rid of them frippity emperor's trappings and I travels lighter. How'd this road ever get here? I never remember seein' it before. These woods are sure full of the queerest things at night. Lord God, don't let me see no more of them hants. Oh, sure. That was all in your head. Wasn't nothing there. Wasn't no Jeff. You know what? You just get seeing them things because your belly's empty, and you're sick with hunger inside. Bless God I don't see no more whatever they is. Mercy, Lord, mercy. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I's coming. You white devil. I'll gets even with you yet sometime. Where's my hammer? Give me my hammer and I splits his head. Give me a hammer, will ya? Give me a hammer. I kills you, you white devil, if it's the last thing I ever does. Ghost and devil, I kills you again! Oh, Lord, what I going to do now? Ain't got no bullets left. Only the silver one. What is this place? Seem like I... seem like I been here before. What is I doin'? Seem like... seem like I know that stone and them trees and the river. I remember... seem like I been here before. Oh, oh, glory, I'm scared of this place. Him dead. Lord, I done wrong. I knows it. Oh Lord. Down here where these fool bush niggers raised me up into the seat of the mighty, I steals all I could grab. Lord, I done wrong. I knows it, I's sorry. Forgive me, Lord. Forgive this poor sinner. Oh, Lord, you done protect this sinner. You done saved this sinner, Lord. I done repent. Oh, Lord, I done repent. And I's coming through, Lord. Oh, Lord, no. Yes, I... Have mercy, Lord. Mercy. My Lord, hear my prayers! Oh! The silver bullet! You don't gets me yet! I bet he's miles away way by now and safe at the coast. I told you you'd lose him, didn't I? Beating your silly drum and casting your stinking spells. Blimey, what a pack. We'll catch him. You see. Why don't you go in the woods and hunt after him? What's the good in waiting? We catch him. Well, you ain't thinking that's him, I hopes. That's him. My men got silver bullet, kill him sure. They got a silver bullet? Lead bullet no kill him. Him got strong charm. I cook money, make silver bullet. Make strong charm, too. Ahh. Well, they did for you right enough, Jonesy, me lad. Dead as a herring. Where's all your high and mighty airs now, your bloomin' majesty? Silver bullets. Blimey. Anyhow, you died in the height of style.
