Translation and subtitles by nassi (aka puustina) Enjoy the movie! Bouldering is the same as life You face a wall and climb it and after you climb it a new wall will appear! Well? Makes you want to try it, right? Rather… Why didn't you get someone to shoot that video for you? That's not important. So, how about it?! Let's do our best together! Well… Maybe not this time Damn! (2 weeks earlier) Looks like the bone shouldn't be a problem Then that means… You can resume your activities Great! Take it easy though Even though it has healed, the fact that you broke it remains Thank you All right Out of the way What..? The school wont officially recognize you as a club unless you have at least 7 members How could I have known about that? Please don't just tear down the bouldering club walls like that As you are the sole member it can't even be called a club in the first place 7 people, was it? 7 people… I just have to gather seven people, right? That's right I will definitely gather them Hey, you! How about bouldering? No thanks What about you? It's fun! I'm already busy so… No thanks Damn! Come check us out We're the bouldering club Excuse me Come join us You too You can do it on the side too Bouldering is a lot of fun Bouldering, join us And you too Bouldering? I kinda wanna try it But isn't it a bit scary how desperate he is? It's fun You're right. Creepy! Huh? Am I doing this the wrong way? If pushing doesn't work, pull Aren't those the rules of love Someone came Prey really came I want to speak up but I'll endure it This… It's here! Yes? Is this like climbing mountains? Excuse me? If I join you, I can scale mountains? Mountains? Of course! We climb mountainlike rocks in practice too! For real? Growing up surrounded by mountains all these big city high-rise buildings are suffocating me Well, it's a bit different but… I guess it's fine Excuse me… Aren't you gonna advertise? My current tactic is to just wait Even if you wait no one will come Is it okay if I try luring people in? Go for it. I'm not sure if it's the best way to handle this though Come check us out! We're the bouldering club! Bouldering?! See, what did I tell you? I hate bouldering! What's your problem? What is it? Calm down! Scary… The city is scary Well, Akemi… Akemi? Some asshole who did bouldering took her away from me Oh, your girlfriend Yeah It was this guy called Sakuraba You aren't Sakuraba, are you?! I'm Okajima and this here is Arai My dear Akemi, taken away by a climber… That's it then? What is this guy doing now it looks like he's trying to start a fight instead All you need to do is make her reconsider The only thing that Sakuraba has that you lack is the fact that he does bouldering and you don't, right? What the hell is this guy saying That's exactly right And this guy too! Let's do it bouldering Yeah They both are a real pain Thanks for the meal Thanks for the meal Was it tasty? Yup Good Time for one last thing then A protein shake If you're going to do bouldering, you have to take care of your body That protein powder… Is that Iron Sports' vanilla flavored whey? A troublesome guy showed up This one's also bad news Excuse me This isn't half bad You can tell? Yeah, I can Sorry, I'm going to say something rude Your muscles… They are just for show, right? What is this guy saying? Those are not muscles that you actually put to use You don't really use them too much How were you able to figure that out? Oh, so he was right I can tell I'm actually a drummer I'm not in a band right now though so I don't get much exercise That's a waste Since you already have these muscles why not use them for something a bit more practical? What do you mean? Bouldering Bouldering? I see Sounds like it could work So this guy is okay with not being in a band then, eh Oh, right This is indeed a vanilla whey protein powder Is that right It really has to be this, right? Nevertheless, you really have nice muscles don't you Thank you Are you a new student at the Department of Philosophy? Yeah Great My name's Kuwamoto Also in the philosophy department I'm Kawaguchi Have you already decided on a club to join? Wanna check them out together? Sure 3 more people This is bad I'm running out of time I want to start practicing right now But we can't use the club walls yet, can we? We'll make one You can make something like this? Yeah. There are lots of people making their own walls Is that so That red one, wouldn't it be better to put it here? Isn't it out of reach if you put it there? You can reach it if you jump What about this big green one then? That one… I'm putting this one here Don't just put it wherever Well, for now… What about putting these two together? Excuse me What game are you playing? Huh? Alright! You really have a good eye for this Not at all Let's climb then! Good Hold it down Like this and then… Good good Feels good Get out of the way, it's dangerous Watch out I told you to get out of the way We can't use this to practice every day, can we? Yeah, it's too dangerous after all That's because you weren't holding it properly Still, it's impossible whether or not I'm holding it But we still need 2 more people If we can get 2 more people to join… Hey, let's join the dance club together They said it's also beneficial for finding a job I wonder if that really is the case For sure. Besides, it's fun It really is fun What does it have to do with finding a job Hey, you… You're Kawaguchi, right? Long time no see Have you decided on a club yet? The bouldering club is currently searching for members Come climb with us Someone you know? Yeah. He has experience We used to participate in the same competitions in the past He's really good too Then… Sorry I will not join Why not? Let's do it! Please, join the club, you two Me too? If you do not join, then I won't have a chance to get Akemi back I don't really get what you're saying but I'm not joining What's that? People who do bouldering really are trash, aren't they After begging you to join like this, you should just do it You have experience after all, right? Yeah Trying too hard there Okay Let's have a match then If you win I won't bother you anymore If we win, you'll have to join us Alright That goes for you too Whaaat? That's how it's done! Well done Momota This is a scam Anyone would think that it was going to be a bouldering match Why are you calling it a scam? I clearly said bowling, not bouldering See? Okay Have a match with me If you win at bowling I wont bother you anymore Right? Shit Now that it has come to this all we can do is win, Kawaguchi I'll have you two joining the club then Really, me too? You can join the dance club on the side too Oh Okajima What is it? You really do not remember, do you? I… It's a promise then With this we have 7 members Yeah Now we can restart the bouldering club Let's aim for victory at the Inter University competition Yeah! The rules of bouldering are simple For example on this route you start here and use these purple holds to climb the wall Clearing the route requires you to grab the marked hold with both hands That's the top Let's do this! There are many different types of holds This is a jug Incut and pinch Sloper Pocket You grab each of these in their own special way Well then… Kuwamoto! Try climbing this route Looks simple enough Like this? Alright Not like this, huh? Pay attention to how you grab the hold to your left Almost there I can do this Do it! Alright Like so Then Try this route next That looks easy enough too Okay Alright That was more difficult than I expected You did it in the wrong order Once you grab the hold with your left hand… See? The rest is easy This is called reading a route Momota try climbing it using this method Isn't it too easy once you know the trick? Good luck Like that Huh? What should we do with guys who know how to do it and still fall? Basic training it is Walk alongside the wall without using your hands, huh? I wonder if this will really help us Besides, this is really embarassing It's unfair that Okajima is the only one not doing this So tired Next you'll be working on your arms 90 degree pull-ups, typewriter pull-ups and lastly finger pull-ups, 10 repetitions each But where..? You're fine with not training Okajima? Yes, because I already know the basics Alright Look When you're able to do this, you'll be able to climb and have fun Later So tired Where's Okajima? He left already What the hell, I thought he was going to treat us food or something It's somewhat surprising how much Okajima likes being alone Yeah, considering what he's usually like Now that you mention it, Kawaguchi, you used to compete with Okajima? Yeah Back in middle school we used to go to competitions together Okajima sure must be strong I'll be going then Wanna go grab something to eat? I'll pass, I have to go to the dance club after all Oh, okay I'll be going to a game center on the way home Come in What's this about? In competition finals you're not allowed to see the routes beforehand Where do the competitors wait until then? They'll be locked away in a different room waiting anxiously to see the wall You can look now This is it If you want to become a strong climber upon seeing the route you should immediately be able to imagine how to climb it If you can't imagine the route, you will lose Well then, Nakamichi Imagine how to climb this route and try it Okay Do your best Don't worry You should've used more chalk I hate dirtying my hands This hurts Is there really a point to all this? Akemi! Akemi! I will not lose This might actually be useful These are the individual competition entry forms fill them out Should we be participating in this? You don't feel like doing it? I'm fine either way Then it's better to participate Bouldering is ultimately an individual thing Although there is the autumn team competition the greatest thing about bouldering is challenging yourself Individual competitions Uh huh No choice but to try it out ourselves then Yeah All of us here are rivals I'll beat that bouldering asshole I'll be going then Thanks for today I'll also be going You don't need to go to band practice? Nope, since I don't currently have one Do you want to quit? I'm fine I'm alright You obviously aren't alright If you used your feet… I know, I know You don't have to force yourself - I know Do you really - Yeah I know Seniors! Okajima! What a coincidence! I thought you might be here and came to take a look Why would you think that? After joining the workforce, I thought you would be coming here to let out some stress You're right. Being a working adult is tough That's right! It's been so tough I even gained a lot of weight and became fat So, the injury? Yes It has healed perfectly The shoulder is even better now than before! Is that really so? Yeah and this Sunday I'll be participating in my last individual competition would you like to come and cheer for me? So it's already the season for the individual competitions, huh Of course I'll come Me too Thank you You look like you're raring to go already Of course - It's good that you're back on track again Good luck Thank you Those guys look strong It seems the last year winners were also from that university Kawaguchi Kawaguchi… You mean THAT Kawaguchi? I thought he quit Yeah I will now be explaining the rules Try to climb these 4 routes during the next 60 minutes You can climb in any order you'd like Each route can be tried a total of 5 times Those with the most routes topped will advance to the finals If two competitors are tied the one with fewer tries wins Let's do this! Come on! Come on Damn If you aren't able to climb to the top you could at least keep the holds clean Good luck! Even if you knew how to, you'll never reach the top with a body like that Looks like Okajima and Kawaguchi will be able to pass the preliminaries Yeah But it's not like they both haven't made some mistakes they'll have to do much better in the finals Yeah Those qualifying for the finals should enter the isolation room So this is the rumored isolation They really are strict about it, aren't they The time limit in the finals is 4 minutes The one who makes it to the top with the fewest tries wins Hell yeah! Yeah! Competitor 26, Kawaguchi, it's your turn Okajima I'll be going then Yeah, good luck Do your best Kawaguchi Good luck, relax! Expulsion? Not being fair? Suspected of cheating? You're still climbing, huh You sure he isn't going to do it this time? I heard he cheated He suddenly seemed to lose his focus there Well, he's still young after all Next up is Okajima To win he can try it up to three times, huh Good luck Okajima! Okajima! Good luck! Ah, yes Good luck Okajima! Good luck That's a shame Okajima, do your best! Okajima… Good luck Okajima! Why isn't he trying something different for the jump just try it with both hands! It's true that he could ease the burden on his right hand by also using his left hand but this way it will be easier to get a hold of the next hold after that He should first focus on what's right in front of him! This is your last chance Okajima! Come on! You can do it Tried Tried If you intend to come back and be half-assed about this I will not forgive you! It's not that Then why did you fall? It's just due to lack of strength You of all people should know better than to try and deceive me Thank you for your hard work Thanks Cheers Cheers I couldn't climb anything anymore Nakamichi, eat your beans Eat lots Let's just eat I'm good Listen to me everyone I'll be retiring from the club after today Aren't you going to be participating in the team competition? That's right The teams are made up of six people you guys should go Is this okay? What do you mean? Quitting after having lost Yeah No matter if I won or lost I decided I would start looking for a job after the individual competitions were over Oh, is that so Looking for work huh… Sorry for ruining the mood But I still intend to give you my full support and show up during practice every once in a while I'll keep watching over you until the end The next captain will be Arai Me?! Why? He was the first to join Today's finals… I know what you want to say I also heard it from my seniors Why didn't I try using both of my hands? That's right Before the injury I would've definitely been able to do that with just my right hand I didn't even see using both hands as an option there Even if I had caught it with both hands it would have felt like losing to my former self Is that so? I did end up losing though I slipped and ended up looking lame In life, there are no walls that you can't overcome hard walls are there to tell you to try just a bit harder Shut up. No one here is talking about quitting What's up with the sudden captainlike speech? Leave comparing bouldering and life to Okajima Okay! Starting today we'll continue practicing for the team competition Excuse me… What? Well… Back when we were at the individual competition I realized that even with lazy practice like this we wont catch up to Shoryu University What's with you… Here I'm trying to cheer you up and you go ahead and say something like that I actually thought so too The gap is too big I think so too That's why we need to practice hard..! I think everyone should focus on the things they are good at instead What do you mean? I see In the team competition not everyone climbs every route Power type, slab type, special type There will be different kinds of routes So making sure that everyone can finish the types of routes they are already good at would be better Is that what you mean? Indeed But what kind of routes are we good at? I have no idea Me neither Bouldering is the same as life Oh! The things you usually do might reveal the routes you're good at Favorite things… I wonder what mine is? I like dancing! Kawaguchi Yes Look I got my hair dyed Okay… Amazing How much money did you waste on these? These things are what I live for spending that money on anything else would've been pointless You're doing it wrong Imagine what's going to happen next Don't just look at what's right in front of you instead consider the next few steps in advance I myself am always thinking five or six moves ahead Look at the upper and lower part of the body separately Don't they look like completely different organisms? This is an imitation of a swan Even when it's desperately treading water under the surface above the surface it looks elegant Let's start with simple moves Follow my movements and try to keep up Right Is that supposed to be simple? That isn't simple at all Just imitate him Right, left Yeah! Right I'm doing it! Good going Arai! Yeah, you're really good What? This is where you work part time? That's right For men it really has to be soba noodles, right? Alright, listen The trick is to use your entire body and lift Sorry for making you wait Looks good! Sorry for making you wait! Monkeys and orangutans… How are they able to just keep clinging onto a tree? That's because they aren't using unnecessary muscles! They latch on with their fingertips stretch as far as possible and relax their body This is the trick! More importantly, why are you so knowledgeable about monkeys? We used to see them often back at my home in the mountain Orangutans… - Where was his home again? Beats me Besides… Did he get rid of his accent? Yeah He also seems to have started using contact lenses Orangutans are the ultimate climbers. In bouldering too… Give it your all Using both your hands and feet Softly and smoothly Cool! I used to want to be a pro after all Why did you give it up? It was the usual thing. I had a different concept of what music was simply put, I wasn't able to see eye to eye with people Give it a try Sure Of course I can't do it straight away! Momota and Kuwamoto have a good sense of balance they'll be in charge of the slab routes Sure Arai and Takaido have lots of strength they'll be responsible for overhanging walls Okay Nakamichi you're best at reading the routes so you'll be in charge of the special routes Understood And Kawaguchi you'll be climbing whatever they decide to throw at you Understood That aside, Okajima… Hm? When will you be taking us up to the mountains? Huh? When you were recruiting club members you said we would be practicing at actual mountains Ah, rather than mountains I was talking about boulders As a last minute effort let's go to the mountains! Let's! - Sounds good! Despite there being such nice nature around us Okajima still couldn't come Well, isn't that to be expected since he's looking for a job? Despite having retired from the club he still finds the time to practice with us That's a nice river over there! Wow, it's beautiful Something like this should be fine right? Come on! Nice! Can you stretch out your right hand? Be careful Nice Foot foot foot Oh, you were here too? Well if it isn't our friends from Shoryu University Don't make a scene at the boulders What's your problem? You really know how to spoil the mood Are you participating in the team competition? Yeah, of course Kawaguchi I didn't get a change to talk to you at the individual competition I'm Sakuraba. We used to go to the same gym in middle school Do you remember me? Yeah… Sakuraba? Sakuraba… If our teacher Oshima hadn't pointed it out, I wouldn't have realized it was you I didn't expect you to come back after all What do you mean? If you have something to say, just say it Don't cheat anymore Always clinging to the past I'm sick of that, Sakuraba! Sakuraba? You're that bouldering bastard who took Akemi away from me! Aren't you also a bouldering bastard? Stop that you two Step back this has nothing to do with you Stop It hurts! Kuwamoto! Are you okay? Kuwamoto, you okay? Where does it hurt? Hey Kuwamoto try not to move Let's call an ambulance I'm sorry Because I got angry… No, it's also our fault for not stopping you What are you guys doing? The future of the club is on your shoulders What are you doing? It was you guys, right? Yes? We're very sorry I've heard most of it from Sakuraba already it seems there was some fault also on our side. My apologies Sorry You… How's the injury? I should be able to do something about it before the competition Let me see You can't go out there like that! If he wants to go, you should let him Having someone who is hurt participate… As an instructor, I just can't allow something like that I don't know what your intentions currently are when it comes to climbing but if you really want to turn a new page when you come face to face while bouldering make sure things like this don't happen Only being a burden on those who are serious about the sport is something I will never forgive What's his problem? Hey, what was all that about? As long as I'm here, I'll just keep causing you trouble Why? Sorry I'm quitting too Eh? No, no, wait a second What happened? You really don't remember? What happened in the past I had passed the preliminaries and the finals were coming up the next day Remember to cool down at home and prepare for tomorrow Yes Thank you for your hard work - Thank you One more step Yes Is it okay if I go to the toilet real quick? Sure Thank you for your hard work - You too, both of you (No entry without permission) As if beckoned, I entered the room Then, without hesitation I flipped over the whiteboard It was immediately clear that these weren't the preliminary routes I climbed earlier My desire to win was stronger than any guilt I felt You sure took your time Let's go Good luck Oshima, always having been there to look after me immediately noticed something strange in the way I climbed And then, at the hardest part… The shape of the hold, the distance they were exactly the way I had imagined them When it comes to bouldering there's no bigger advantage than knowing the course beforehand Due to having been found guilty of breaking the rules Kawaguchi has been disqualified Third place, Okajima Second place… That stuff is in the past right? It doesn't matter anymore If I were to show up at the competition and things got out of hand again, it would be troublesome for all of you Once a person is labeled getting rid of that label is difficult Well, this time fight fair and square and have them take that label back Even if we were to win they'd just think I cheated again If you quit, this club will be finished too Does it really matter whether it's awkward or not? You should think of the teammates who are fighting with you the opponents don't matter You just need to overcame the wall in front of you That's all there is to it Face that wall and be true to yourself What about you, Okajima? Were you able to do that? In the competition earlier were you able to face that wall and be true to yourself? I ended up saying something like that because I know what Okajima used to be like I don't know why you were disqualified but that was some awesome climbing Please teach me the move you used in the finals I want to master it I want to win next time Sure It's a promise In a situation where no one wanted to get close to me with the intent of trying to get better he came and talked to me To me, who only cared about appearances it felt as if this was someone I would never be able to win I want to participate in the competition My band just disbanded I don't want us to also disband Doing things alone just isn't fun I also want to participate I want to win I went ahead and bought these They're matching outfits for us Well… You know… It's just that I didn't want to get chalk on my clothes Where did you get the money? I sold my games I also want to go I read the competition rules again and while the six person requirement is absolute even if I can't climb I can still be a member of the team Simply put, a loss by default You can do something like that? Yeah. So we just need one more Okay Let's go recruit someone then Let's go What about you Okajima? Were you able to face that wall and be true to yourself? Are you a new student at the Department of Philosophy? Why are we doing this again? Great! My name's Kuwamoto Also in the philosophy department Have you already decided on a club to join? I quit the dance club You did? Yeah Why? To be able to concentrate on bouldering and to focus on the team competition I probably wont be able to climb due to the injury so I at least want to do my best to support the team Everyone is giving it their best shot I want to see them win Let's do this together, Kawaguchi You've finished eating, right? Time to drink! Cheers Cheers - Cheers OK These are our matching outfits I want you to also wear one But I was the one who bought them… Try it out I think it would look good on you Yeah! Hello there Sorry for bothering you Okajima do you have time to talk? Sure For making you worry earlier because of our negligence… I am sorry We are so sorry Oh, you were all there Okajima I said some arrogant things sorry about that Kawaguchi Rather than what you said to me, what I said to you… Okajima! We will be participating in the team competition! Oh, really? I wont be climbing though but I want us to still win So after thinking this through we had an idea Would you like to come as Kuwamoto's replacement? Eh? Actually, we already submitted the registration form Doing something like that on your own… The competition is in 3 days at 11:00 That's the day of my final job interview Sorry, they just contacted me earlier Oh, is that so. Can't help it then Sorry Well then Okajima… Hm? good luck with job hunting! Too loud you guys I'm hanging up Okay, bye Let's win Mr. Matsumoto? Yes Thank you for having me Please come in Mr. Inaguchi Ok Thanks for having me Good luck Okajima Okajima, good luck! You can do it! Okajima, you can do it Good luck Mr. Okajima? Yes When you consider your time as a student what were the biggest hurdles you faced and how did you manage to overcome them? Yes… The biggest hurdle was getting injured while bouldering This sport known as bouldering is something I've been doing since childhood in my sophomore year I placed second in the Inter University competition I was sure I would win the next year but I ended up injuring myself and wasted the whole year And in my last competition I ended up failing But… Upon trying a similar route later on I was able to climb it I see Why do you think that is? I was able to do it because of my friends Having gone through rehabilitation all alone I had stubbornly started to believe that I had to overcome my past self but… while practicing with my friends I started to see what was around me and realized how I should climb And that isn't all I had forgotten that having fun is what really matters I started because I was having fun and had forgotten that But practicing together with friends made me truly happy and able to face the wall without pretending I am sorry I… Will be going after all! Hey, you, wait Registration will be closing soon We are the Toridezaka University team Understood Mr. Kawaguchi Ryoji? Yes Mr. Arai Musashi? Yes - Okay Mr. Momota Wakaru? Yeah - Ok Mr. Takaido Jinta? I am Nakami… - I'll be joining! I want to join Okajima! It has already started… And you're drenched Please Besides, when did you become blonde again? Oh, the color probably washed away in the rain Crap, we don't have an outfit for Okajima Right… You, give him your shirt, hurry We have one for Okajima too Oh, well done But I was the one who bought them… Sure Ok, listen to me let's aim for victory Yeah! Momota Akemi So you were also doing bouldering, huh Yeah Feels like you've become more attractive lately Sorry, I need to concentrate on the match I'll be going Eh? In men's team competition, the teams consist of six people No preliminaries will take place and winners will be decided directly I will now be explaining the rules Each team of six people will have one person climbing each route The time limit for each route is 4 minutes The team with most routes climbed wins If two teams are tied the winner is the team with the least number of tries Participants are allowed to give each other hints Good luck You did it! Yeah! The first five Shoryu University members have finished their routes perfectly None of them have fallen even once What if they clear the last one perfectly too? Then the others will have no choice but to complete all six routes without any mistakes That would be pretty tough, wouldn't it Come on! Good luck! You can do it Come on! Take it easy Good going Come on! This was their first mistake! Come on! Yeah! Well done Yeah As expected, he was able to adapt That means our guys can't make more than one mistake That's really tough Let's go! Yeah! Good luck! Good luck Momota! Come on The first to climb is under a lot of pressure so why did you pick Momota? The first reason was his guts also his focus was spot on today He is the most calm out of all of us Come on! Good luck Momota! Do your best Come on You can do it Momota Do it! Lastly, he has the sense of balance required for this route Hell yeah! Well done You can do it! Relax Come on! Nice You got this No footholds there Figure 4! Well done You can do it Yeah! Go for it Yeah!! Go for it! Nakamichi Good luck What's happening? He's studying the route But shouldn't he actually start climbing it? That's very much like him since he knows he can't rely on his strength he intends to finish it in one go Good luck! You can do it! Go for it Nakamichi Good luck He ended up being the one with most chalk on him Do it Nice! Yeah! Hell yeah! Nice one If the next guy doesn't make any mistakes that only leaves Okajima and Kawaguchi… So it's all or nothing, huh Come on Good luck Arai! You can do it Do your best Arai Well done You got this Do it Go for it Good luck! In life, there are no walls that you can't overcome hard walls are there to tell you to try just a bit harder You can do this Start with your foot Well done Nice Good luck You can do it Good job Whew Nice! No mistakes so far If you notice anything, please tell me This time I want to win Ok Please teach me the move you used in the finals I want to master it I want to win next time Okajima! Good luck! Good luck Okajima has changed, hasn't he Yeah Overcome yourself Well done! Okajima! Come on, come on, come on! Hell yeah! Yeah!! Nice He really has grown since the individual competitions Good one Yeah Hell yeah Nice If Kawaguchi manages to finish without mistakes, they will win Looking good Good luck Kawaguchi Surpass yourself Good luck! You can do it Kawaguchi Go! Do it! Go for it Kawaguchi The same mistake that Shoryu University made earlier! Still, that was their first mistake if he finishes on his next try, they will be even But if he falls they lose The next climb will decide the match Kawaguchi If you tried using two holds instead of one don't you think you could make it? Sorry Let me try it again Go do it your way! You can do it, Kawaguchi! Good luck Do it, Kawaguchi I can't erase the fact that I cheated so my only option is to face my past and overcome it Go for it, Kawaguchi! Decide the match! Kawaguchi, grab it The last hold! Uh… Kawaguchi Go for it! Good luck Kawaguchi Come on! Go, Kawaguchi! You can do it! Good luck Yeah! Go! Go! You got this! Yeah! That was good Good job, well done! Sorry What nonsense are you spouting That ending was the best You managed to grab it really well there We are the best, aren't we Looks like we have a goal for next year, thanks to a certain someone Thank you for your hard work Thank you Oh, Okajima We can take your hold down now, right? What? Well aren't you ruthless Hm? Hello, it's Okajima Yes. Yes Huh? Thank you very much! Goodbye What was that? It was the final interview I went to before I got a tentative offer Eh? The one where you left halfway? Yeah, the one I left to attend the match That's one hell of a company Congratulations! What did you talk about in the interview? I'm not telling you that Why not? Now I really want to know What?! What is it this time? Did they take their offer back after all? Sports climbing is going to be an official event at the Tokyo Olympics Eh? It's true! Now we really have to win the Inter University competition next year Yeah What about you Okajima..? Will you be joining the workforce after all? There's no way I could do that! Last Hold!
