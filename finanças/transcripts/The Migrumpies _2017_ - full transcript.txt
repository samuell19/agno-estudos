Wild strawberries from the jungle! - Hello! My name is Weizenhuber, I work in TV. -Great, nice to meet you. We're shooting a documentary about this neighbourhood, and I'd like to do an interview with you. How do you feel about the upcoming neighbourhood renewal? We're looking forward to it, it's a big deal for us. Things have changed around here in the last 25 years, right? I like the neighborhood. If not, I would have moved away years ago. You get along with the other vendors? Are there a lot of conflicts? No conflicts. We get along perfectly. I've never liked the place as much as now. It's vibrant! That's a nice picture guys, let's go! Wallah, brother. What's up? You know, let's roll, that sort of thing. A slap in the face with a foot, you know. Hello there! Do you live here? We're looking for residents with an immigrant background. And that's you, right? Yeah, sure. Immigrant background. Can't help it. Open your ears, boy. When I tell you to see Ferdl, you go see Ferdl. Now, he tells me you weren't there-- Excuse me. I think that's the wrong part, isn't it? I'm reading Moser's part. Benny, Moser is Austrian. I'm Austrian, too. Of course. But you're here for... Omar. -Omar, the Arab cab driver. Please read Omar. No, I won't play him. Excuse me? I won't play that part. I don't know that guy. But I know Moser. And I see myself as Moser. OK. Thank you. -But... I could give you a different Moser. Just give me another chance. Wow, that’s a bit too much integration. Do we need to call security here? Alright, alright. I got it. But you're missing out on something. Can I have one more? Incoming message from Extras Agency. Shall I read? -Yes, let's hear it. Benny, you moron! The audition was a done deal. -No, don't read it ... That was the last job you screwed up. -I said don't read... Go find yourself a new agency, asshole. They threw you out again, right? -No, I'm changing agencies. Benny, your life's just too boring. Great art needs drama. You have to suffer. -That's just a cliché. I think it's time for a drink. -Yes, please. Moscow Mule, everyone? -White Russian for me. But no whipped cream for him. -Lactose-free. Drinks are on me. Three Moscow Mules, and a White Russian, lactose-free. Soy milk? -Right. Excuse me, I just wondered if I forgot to turn off the stove... Oh, Sylvie, hello! Finished your thesis? Biology, right? No. Zoology? -This isn't Sylvie. This is... Jana. Hello Jana. You really still live with your mum? No, it's just temporary. This is not your apartment? Let me guess, you ain't no actor either. Of course he's an actor! Is she really the best you could find? High-priced and exclusive. A clear USP and targeted tonality. That's how we know and love Dr. Mate. And now, to raise this image to a higher level, we've given the whole campaign a facelift. This is the new Dr. Mate. The woman with a beard, that's funny. Because women don't have beards. At least back in the old days, you know. That's very zeitgeisty. It triggers something. I thought we'd lost him. Come on. The guy loves us. What's up, Romana? You're half an hour late again. Sorry, Marko. Family problems. Sorry. What do you think? 1,200 euros for a baby buggy? If 4,000 for a bike is OK, then 1,200 is alright for a baby buggy. So which one do you prefer? That one. We can pay that later as well. That's only the second warning anyway. We'll pay that one another time. We don't have to pay this yet, either. That's the electricity bill, Marko. -So what? We definitely have to pay that one. -The bike magazine subscription? Hello? Oops, sorry. Nice place. Let's start with a few shots of the market. Where are you going? You can't just run off. You know what, I'll tell them about you! If you don't want a new nurse, then... -Retirement home? Yes, retirement home! What a son, just like the Austrians! Why not? You'll like it. You'll have people there. Someone to play chess with. And it's easier with the wheelchair, too. Is that what you learned in community service? What's community service got to do with it? You could have done military service, but my son prefers to wipe filthy Austrian assholes! What are you talking about? I've been asking you for six months to move that sofa. For six months I've wanted that sofa gone! Where should I put all my brochures? Get out! Leave me alone. Mister Bilic... see you later. Don't ask. He collects vouchers. He thinks he's saving money. Pretty bizarre apartment. No wonder you can't find a nurse. The apartment is the least of our problems. Over there. -You can't do that! Why not? You really think it'll be there for long? I forgot you're from the ghetto. Wait. Put it down. From the hips... I don't know why you won't do it. You want to be an actor, right? So you have to take what you can get. Besides, it's not so bad. You play an Arab cab driver, so what? Wallah, brother. What's up? You know, let's roll. Things like that. -"Let's roll..." Look, it's just a job. One day you'll be like Pacino, or Keitel. Then, you can pick your parts. And you'll play your "Mr. Orange". I guess you're right... Hello there! Do you live here? We're looking for residents with an immigrant background. And that's you, right? Yeah, sure. Immigrant background. Can't help it. Seems you live here, too, could you introduce yourselves? Where are you from? My name is Omar... Sharif. Like the actor, you know? I'm from Egypt, too. And this is my best friend... Tito. From Yugoslavia. Could you guys tell me about life in this neighbourhood? We're making a TV documentary about Rudolfsgrund. And I suppose life here isn't easy, right? Easy? Life is hard round here. Lots of problems. Just look around... it’s brutal. Anyway, Tito grew up here, too. Man, tell her about yourself. You know so many stories, don't you? Tell her the story we were just talking about. Which one? What we were just talking about! -Oh, I see... With the cops and the sports bag. -Yes, sounds interesting! Well, there was... Here's how it went. Benny was the only one who had weed, and this guy wanted to buy some. They arranged to meet at the station, but the guy doesn't turn up. He had the weed in a little sports bag. How much pot was it? Not much. -Not much... Five, ten kilos. -15 kilos?! Whatever lady, just listen! He goes to the station, and suddenly he has to piss. He walks into the toilet, and who's standing there? Four cops and a German Shepherd dog, barking at him. So I go in, you see- He knows the dog is barking at him. Omar thinks he's fucked. But you know what he does next? He puts down the bag and starts pissing, nice and easy. And guess what he does after that? I dry my hands. -He even dries his hands! With one of those things where... you know, you don't touch anything. You know. Really? You really did that? You bet. - You bet. Go spray your own walls! What the hell...? Listen, this wall is for graffiti artists. You can ask the council. We'll see about that! Yeah, we'll see. Now fuck off, will you? What an idiot! Keep it up, boys. It's alright. Tarek, not on the left side. Tarek, a little bit to the right, please. Hello... - Hello. These retirees... I have to... apologize, because he's got nothing to do. My name's Omar... like Omar Sharif. From Egypt? Exactly. And you? Sara. -From where? Round the corner. Mister Bilic, I presume? Huber. Debt collection. Your outstanding debts now amount to... 27,990.18 euros. Look, I'm just about to sign a contract for a very big job, and then everything will be paid off. Just give me one more day. We're going for lunch now. We'll be back at 1:30 on the dot. Hi, how can I help you? Just a minute. -Where are you going? Just a minute! -You can't just walk in there... Good to see you, Mr. Poll. Bilic, what are you doing here? I was in the neighbourhood and I thought we could close the deal right now. What deal? We already have a new agency. Look, Bilic, we were a bit disappointed. We expected more from you. Something edgier and more ethnic, I mean, you're Yugoslavian, aren't you? But we had a deal. Everything was set. Ms. Kratochwil, do we have a crate left for Bilic? Mr. Poll... -But keep at it. Here you are. Hey, brother, what's up? Long time no see. Where ya goin'? I'll drive ya. It's me, Omar. Your cab driver. -Oh, it's you. So, we're cool? Where ya headed? I'll take ya. Look, you're alright, but I need someone who's authentic. No problem. -I need someone who's from that place. I made a mistake, but gimme a second chance, will ya? Please, just one more chance... I think it’s great that you tried, really! Fuck... dammit! Sorry. You okay? Had a bad day? Your dad? We'll sort it out. We'll find a new nurse. Woah, I can feel something! They're funny. Especially Tito. Do you have any others? Yes, sure. But I'd like to concentrate on these two guys. And build everything around them. OK, but it's a sensitive subject right now. Drugs... crimes committed by foreigners... Especially among foreigners. I mean, that's a fact. Yes, and with those two you can focus on all the hot issues. They're two genuine protagonists. Look, do you want your name in the TV listings or on the front page? I'm gonna play golf right now, but I've got a good feeling about this. I'm with you on this, it will totally be... So keep me posted. What is it? We did it! We're in! What do you mean? They want to do a show about us. A whole series. Benny, I really have other problems right now. Wait a minute. That director is crazy about us. We'll be on TV, we'll be famous! Benny, you're not from around here! And the biggest problem is that you're not an immigrant! So forget it! So what? I can become an immigrant. Nope. How are you, Marko? Fantastic. Yeah? Me too. Look, that thing... this TV show... that's the only thing I can do. You told me to be more adaptable. So I'm gonna do it. And when I put on this act, and they believe me: Bang! I tell them it was all a show. They'll say I'm the best actor ever! Everyone will want me. -How do you want to pull it off? Well... no idea. They're looking for welfare cases, clichés! Wanna ask some wogs about their lives? Take your hands off my brochures! You think there's any money in it? They snort coke with 500 euro notes.... They're from TV! They have lots of money. Loads and loads. While we're doing this, you look after him. Do svidaniya! That's Russian, Benny. Hello. How much will we get per episode, you think? No idea... I guess it depends on the ratings. Let's focus right now. Look at those faces. This is a gold mine. The way that guy's smoking... is brilliant. Just keep going. You guys are brilliant. Hey, why so rude?! I don't think that's necessary. I told you it's a stupid idea. It's not a stupid idea. We just don't blend in. We have to be inconspicuous. We have to become one with the environment. Just shut up, Benny. What are you doing? We meet back here in an hour. -Benny! Inconspicuous! What is this? Rocky, part one? Relax, Kayne West. You think your... I'm-just-out-of-rehab, gotta-stay-incognito, paparazzi outfit is any better? Whatever. Let's do this. I like it. His name's Kanye West. Merhaba. -Merhaba. You Turkish? Not today. Two kebabs, thanks brother. Benny, can we just eat something normal? Kebab is normal. Everyone eats kebab. Vegetarian for me please, brother. OK, but my meat is halal. -Thanks, but no. Sorry, but you're not credible. A real Yugoslavian has got to eat meat. It's even halal! You have no clue what halal is, do you? You want it sharp? I don't want no sheep. Gimme lamb, thanks bro. Give him lamb, please. Dig in, brother. -Fine. Sharp lamb. What? -Sharp lamb. I feel like I'm in the Balkans. You don't hear a single word in German! There are "these" people and "those" people, but unfortunately, “these" people are everywhere. Go back to the original material. Hey, have you seen the ratings? Get them in the park. -We are still not where we want to be. And you can cut that, it just slows things down. Marlene? Are you listening? Yes, I'm listening, Wolfgang! Everything alright? I'm working right now. Can't you see that? Thanks for coming by. What are you doing? I love this song. Yes, but enough indie music. If we want to play it right, we gotta listen to this. What's that? -Check it out. That's Turkish folk music. Everyone here listens to this. Couldn't we at least listen to normal music? It is normal music. You're clueless. Just listen to this... that guy... Brilliant. Just brilliant. Look, they're starting to believe us. What's going on? -Merhaba! Turn down that music. -But it's good music, right, brother? Good music? -Hey, relax bro... Hands off, man. Don't touch me! -Hey, why so aggressive? You screwing with me or what? Take it easy, please. It's a misunderstanding. Just a misunderstanding. What exactly is the misunderstanding, huh? Please calm down. You a Kurdish terrorist? -Kurdish? What's he talking about? I haven't done a thing! Please stop. Hey, put that down, come on. -What do you want? Who are you? I know your fucking face, man. -No, you don't know my face. Sure I do. I know your brother. -My brother? What? Yes, I know your brother from the cage. -Where do you know my brother from? From the cage. My brother? Your brother? Yes, your brother! You know what, I'll call him... and tell him about his stupid little brother. Brother... What can I do for you? Please don't call my brother. Then put it away and get lost. -Jesus, are you guys nuts? You're tough, you're cool. Come on, let's go. - Get lost. And you, get rid of that stupid face. No problem, it's fine. You seriously listen to Sivan Perwer in front of a Turkish bar? That's a Kurdish symbol of resistance against the Turkish government. A Kurdish symbol... of resistance... fucking government! What's that got to do with me?! -I didn't know. I really had no idea. Be careful. What's wrong with you guys? He's the one. We have to be just like that. Authentic. Street. Fuck that shit, he broke my nose! Good thing you knew his brother. What brother, brother? I've never seen the guy before. No idea who he is! So what do you guys want? We're new around here. And we'd really like to be more... well, just... like immigrants are. Are you screwing with me? Is this candid camera? What the fuck is wrong with you blokes? He wants to rediscover his roots. And how do you plan on doing that? -No idea... It would be great if you could tell us. What's it like being a foreigner? A foreigner? That's just like Hollywood, man. Whores, cocaine... we got it all, you know? You're never bored if you're an immigrant. That's exactly what I mean! Could you maybe coach us a little? Could you maybe cough up some money? Yeah, sure. -Well then, the sky's the limit! We can do whatever you want, brother. Great! Where do we start? Abi, these two are paying. Get yourself something as well. Listen, I have to go now. We'll start in the boxing club. Yeah, sure... why don't we just start in the boxing club? Brilliant. What's the matter with you? Brilliant. Darling... Don't you carry a thing. Mom? -Oh, lovely. New jacket? Come on. What's going on here? Berti is moving in with us. He left his wife. She probably threw him out because of all that sadomasochistic shit. Don't be so conservative. Life is too short for the missionary position. Please, I don't want to hear that. Look who we have here. Come on now... Help daddy with this case. Omar? Did you sleep in the car? Yes... why not? I'm a street kid, sometimes I sleep in the car. Don't you have a home? -Sure I have a home. Great home. But I need this, sometimes... I go to the car... it calms me... Reminds me of the old days... What old days? Look, it's no big thing. I just have to flee, get away. Shit... I'm really sorry. What? Please forgive me. I didn't realize you were a refugee. What, refugee...? Oh, me? Yes, I am... -Sorry, sometimes I'm a bit slow. I'm a refugee, no problem. If you need anything, let me know, okay? Wait, have a seat, let's talk... Thanks, but I have to look after my UURs. Who? -The UURs. UR what? -Unaccompanied Underage Refugees. Of course... URUs... Omar! I mean it. Just accept my help, really. Bye. Open the door. -I can't let you in, Mr. Bilic. Thomas, stop that "Mr. Bilic" shit and open this door at once! The bailiff will contact you, OK? Who? -The bailiff. OK. Now open this door. I'm really sorry. -Thomas, you little shit, open this door! Mr. Bilic, is everything alright? Calm down. What's wrong? I'm... I'm thirsty. Bring me a beer. There aren't any. You have to go buy one. What are we doing here? I'll miss my favourite show! Well, the beer won't buy itself, Mr. Bilic. Besides, we have some bonding to do. Some what? Forget it. -Are you in a hurry? Because of your favourite show? We don't want to miss it, right? This week's special offers. I thought you might like that, Mr. Bilic. Why do I always listen to you... We're getting into character. Like real actors. Oh really? You know what kind of people are in there? Chechnyans. Kazakhs. All of Eastern Europe. Half of them were in some war, and the other half grew up in an orphanage. Why the prejudice? I don't need that. They're normal people. Hear that? -I think we've waited long enough. I don't believe it. The morons really came. Come on then! What have we got here. Our precious Juwel! Coach, I have two new members for you. Can they pay? -Can they pay? My fee as well! Moe, Kay... let me introduce you to Marko and... Benny. You can call me B. I'll take him. I'm a foreigner, brother, get ten bucks worth of gas Wogs are related to everyone by blood or marriage 30 cousins find a space in your Merc Gotta hug all of them, though you don't even know any of them Stealing Yu-Gi-Oh! cards from the kids, never call a foreigner "son of a bitch" We learned to load our guns in the mountains A wog's mother can kill you with a clog Brother, I'm a street kid, I was always on my own Nobody had time for me. My parents were always working I never went to school. I just dreamed of things I'd never have A villa, a yacht, a Ferrari... real stupid you know? Pretty wild, no? That's the bomb, brother. Everyone's gonna respect you on the street. If you run around like that, everyone'll be scared of you. Just let me... it's a bit tight... And then I was on holiday for five years... Holiday? Five years? Where? In prison, man. One day I took all my parents money, all their savings, to place some bets. Hoping I could double it. And what happened? I lost the lot. The Latino look is timeless. -Amazing, man. Compared to you, Brad Pitt looks like shit. El Mariachi for retards. I'd wear that in real life, too. -Of course you would. And then when I'm on the street, some moron passes by, and I follow him... to the cash machine. I'm right behind him, and then... BANG! Five years, gone. Just like that. I look like a Bulgarian toy boy. -What? Brother! We have to change your style. You have to look like the king. Who's that? That's Abu Gold, man. He's the boss. Where have you been? On the moon? He looks like Abu Tin. -That's a good one, brother. Gimme five. You’re more and more like us, I like it. No, he looks like Abu Tinfoil. -That one was better! I got something in my throat... I'm surrounded by morons. Come on, let's move. Abu Tinfoil, fantastic! Nice jacket. Suits you. Thanks, Benny. Thanks, man. Brother, like Philadelphia and all that shit. I'm hungry. Let's go eat. Wait, why don't we go place a bet? Looks like someone hit the jackpot. Man, use your brain, even if you don't have one. You really think you're gonna win... a Lamborghini or a Ferrari with some shitty sports bet? The betting shop is for kids, man. Dude, there's a different story going on in there. Hollywood and shit, you know what I mean? You gotta think big. What kind of shit? -Funny shit. Come on, let's move. Brother, I love Arabic food. Good food is essential for immigrants. This spread is a revelation. Brilliant. Man, if he's Arabic, I'm Barack Obama. Damn, in your face, man. That was a real good one. That was funny or what? -Sure. Could have been mine. Where is everybody? I mean, this food is really... superb. You think this is his only income, huh? It's all a facade, man. You think he makes that much para with humus and shawarma? You know what I mean, don't you? Arab Mafia, you see? You were always self-employed and never on payroll. So obviously you have to go on the public dole. But there must be something for self-employed people? Sure. If you've paid into the system. Yes, but where... Now don't start trying to make a deal here. Look. I'm not like the others... -Mr. Bilic... I'm a businessman! I just need a little money to get back on my feet. We can work something out, please. As a businessman, I'm sure you'll think of something creative. Be smart, now. Go to the welfare office. You can claim the minimum basic welfare. Yes? Does Marko Billic live here? Who wants to know? We are seizing his assets. This is the wrong apartment. I think he lives one floor up. You ruined my whole life, you little bitch... You know what it's like to spend ten years in the slammer for nothing? You know what it's like... being fucked in the ass by five guys in the toilet? One by one! And each time your head bangs against the wall until it bleeds! Do you like that? Your honour? -I can give you money! Role-play. Ever heard of it? What kind of an actor are you? What do you want to know about our neighborhood? Well, everything. That's where we buy our vegetables. A kilo of tomatoes, 20 cents. You know him? -Sure. I know them all. That's... Oktay, Uncle. He's really wild. He is the richest man around here. Nobody knows how. But that's the way we immigrants are. Nobody has money, but everyone's rich. How about you, are you rich or do you have jobs? Officially? No. Truth? All the time. So you work under the table? Just look around. Nobody here really works. But everyone drives a BMW. -And how does that work? Easy. Some unemployment pay. A bit of welfare. A bit of child allowance. -The usual. The social safety net. -And you're inside it? Watch me swing. Here's where we place our bets. We spend about half the day in here, you know. Cash in, you know what I mean? OK. Let's go inside, we'll get a long shot from here... Wait, wait, wait. We can't do that. Right. -Why not? You can't just walk into the bookies with a camera. Yes, I know. I'll talk to them. For now let's just get through the door- Besides, you're a woman. Some really tough shit is going down in there. What? Sports bets? Oh, come on. You think you can win a... nice car... with sports bets? Use your head, even if you don't have one. Sports bets are for school children. So what do you bet? I've never bet on anything in my whole life. Neither have I. You just said you cash in. What money? Protection money? The way you put it sounds a little harsh. I mean, let's be honest, everyone needs protection. He needs protection. I need protection. Especially you guys need protection. You think you can make para with so much... ... make humus with so much para? The guy who owns this place? He has another source of income. If you know what I mean. Money laundering? We can't talk about everything. Listen, we have to talk about everything, if we want to make this show together. You see, it's... -It's because of previous convictions. You've been convicted? Yes. Previous conviction. Five years of holiday... in the park. Nobody there. Father gone... mother had a headache. I wanted to get on this yacht... because of the bookies. Then there was this idiot... this moron. After training... cash machine... disaster. Villa... ... Ferrari... It wasn't my fault. He mugged someone, you know, he's still a bit traumatized. Oh, I see... Listen, moron, give me 3000... everything... up to the limit! Yeah, come on, moron! Wasn't it more brutal? -He's in pain. Give me the money, moron. Now! Please, don't. I beg you. Gimme. Come on. Here. -OK. Thank you. Like that... Great. And how did they catch you? Guys, time is money. This one goes to the ground floor, that box goes in the car. This box goes to... What's going on here? We're restructuring. OK, and where's Marko? Didn't he talk to you? This is my life. This is my home. This is Rudolfsgrund for life. This is... Ghettobang! We got some good stuff today. But next time we have to really go all out. Why? That was fantastic just now, wasn't it? Well, the mugging was great, and the Reservoir Dogs story was funny, too. But if we want to make a splash with this show, we can't just talk about life here, we have to show it to the people, too! OK, what do you need...? Look, I have to be there when you go out, meet your friends, when you're doing business. I need your real life. The whole thing. If that's a problem, we have other guys we can film... What? What other guys? Hang on, what about money? What money? I thought you were swinging in the welfare net? Omar said there'd be money. That's why I'm doing this. There's no money. Oh really? Well, then there is no Tito either. Wait, I'll sort it out. Why do you keep going on about the money? She'll drop us. You said there'd be money! You think Juwel would go along with all this without asking for money? Pretty unlikely. Oh, dough! Not bad, Mr. Tito. But there isn't any. So I'm done here. Just a minute. We made a deal. I look after your father, and you play along here. That was the deal. The deal was there's money. That was the deal! Then I won't take care of your father anymore! Mr. Bilic... what happened to the last nurse? Don't talk. I can't hear a thing. Just once. Just once I grabbed her ass. Big fuss. Just once. No reason to freak out. Don't you have a key, Marko? What are you doing here? Bathing Bilic. Where's Marko? No idea. He's your boyfriend. What are you wearing? The usual. I'm doing research for a part. I have to go back to the old man. Benny, don't give me that shit. I know exactly what's going on. You think you can make a fool of me? Come on, it's not that bad. Not so bad? This is our life, for God's sake! Please don't cry. I can't handle that sort of thing. Calm down. Take a deep breath. It's not so bad, right? I don't know what to say, really... We'll make it big with this one, believe me. Yeah, maybe on the bankruptcy list! Not at all! Two more episodes and we'll be superstars. Superstars? The TV show... Which TV show, Benny? Right... A bit more to the right. To me... towards me! That's it. Now it's in the middle of the room. Is this your study or mine? Whatever you want, Mr. Bilic. Are you in a hurry, my boy? Do you have something else to do? Yes, sweetheart? Well, at my father’s... Listen, I'm in a really important meeting right now. I can't talk. I'll call you back. The infamous working class neighbourhood Rudolfsgrund has attracted... immigrants for decades now. It's been a social hotspot ever since. Due to the many immigrants and a high unemployement rate, the area has earned itself a bad reputation in recent years. Well, it hasn't gotten better. I think the quality of living definitely dropped. People are afraid. Enough is enough. Back when we moved in, there were only Austrians in our building. And when we moved out, there were only two left. Residents fear further social decline due to the rising influx of refugees. An asylum seeker receives 837 euros, like me, but didn't do anything. And I've worked. -This is only possible here, nowhere else. I wish I were an immigrant living in Austria! Change the channel, this is boring. Helmut Weber, who runs the local pub, feels the economic pressure people are under. Weber is one of the last Austrians working in the market, a minority in the area nowadays. Open your eyes! Look at these people here. There are no customers left for us. Nobody drinks alcohol anymore. There are no Austrian stalls left, there is no Leberkäse, no pork roast. Only lamb. That's just how it is. But now, change is just around the corner. An upcoming gentrification of the neighbourhood... is supposed to turn the tide. Beside the vendors, residents like Omar and Tito should also benefit from it. But they don't take these promises seriously. Like so many people here, they grew up in Rudolfsgrund, and can hardly imagine a life outside the neighbourhood. The ex-convict Omar is unemployed and on welfare. Tito tries to survive with occasional jobs. Like many others, these two have given up hope on getting a job. Here, nobody really works. But everyone drives a BMW. Bilic! They both seem to be proud of their criminal expertise. It's a necessary part of life, as they put it. My mother had headaches. My father... I wanted to get on this yacht... What is it? -Your two pals on TV. What are these idiots doing? -Well, they're your friends. Motherfuckers! -Austrians. What's wrong? No more graffiti? To tell you the truth, I don't care what they do. I just don't want them to screw things up. I like your attitude. -Yeah. We saw you on TV, by the way. Was I good? Well, I think the kids thought it was pretty cool. What about you? I also thought it was... interesting. -Interesting? Yes... maybe a little too cool. If you want, I can also be very uncool. I bet. Bilic, Bilic, Bilic ... that's fantastic, you're... you're a genius. I mean, I knew you had it in you. But that you'd go into that primitive environment, to those simple people. That terrain! Look, let's just forget what happened. You take care of the ratings... and I'll be your offshore oasis. And now we'll all write TV history together. I just want to mention that this was originally my idea. Tell me boys, are your lives really that boring? You'll be our drug dealer. No, man. I'm not doing that. Forget it. Forget it. No way, motherfucker. Just because he's black? -No chance. The key is to act authentic. Don't get emotional. No overacting. Klara, you're a whore. Oh god, sorry. It has a mind of its own. You didn't think we'd abandon you because of a little money, did you? What's up with this music? Fuck that weak shit. Let's listen to something good. Some Abu. -Abu Gold? Far out, even she knows Abu Gold! -Well of course. There he is, Paco. -Who's Paco? Our fighter. We're picking up our share. -Oh, from the illegal boxing? Wow, look at those arms... -Well, he does push-ups. The para! How much? Enough. So boys, did you like the way I went to sleep in the second round? What? How I faked a knock-out? What's wrong with that guy? What do you mean? Well, his voice, for example...? Believe me, his voice is the least of his problems. Check it out, this is our number one whore, Olga. She's the best. What's up, bitch? Hello. I'm Olga. The whore. We know that. What the fuck is wrong with you, you cocksucking faggots? I've been waiting here for three hours! Yes, sorry. How was last night? Last night was good. Lots of very big dicks... if you know what I mean? I know exactly what you mean. Now give us the money. Alright, here's the dough. Maybe you should take a bit more heroin, Holger? Holger? What the fuck is wrong with you? You a faggot or what? My name's Olga. Hey, Olga. -Hello. Who the fuck are you? I'm Marlene Weizenhuber. -So what? And we're doing a documentary with these guys. Olga has to work... And that's why I'd like to talk to you a bit. Bitch, I got no time... -They're your pimps, right? They're my best pimps... -Olga, get back to work! What is wrong with you? -Do they take good care of you? Bitch, they take perfect care of me! Don't you get it? I'm a whore. I have to fuck all night long. What's wrong with you? Hey, don't film me! What's up with this camera here? I don't do porn, get it? Fuck off, bitch. And you, little cocksucker, get the fuck out. There you go, Olga. Come on, we have to go. We have appointments. When he's here and you film, you have to make him anonymous. Yes, we do that in the studio. -It's called "anonymatization". Here comes that gypsy... -Djambo Wambo, our main man! Everything's sexual? -You bet. Be careful, man! Hello, camera crew. What's up? Where you been, man? -Where I been, man? Where I been!? I went to see Pablo Escobar, you got me? Djambo only hangs with the real boys. And then... I got hungry. I get you. Give me the para. What do you mean? -The money. Come on, give us our share! Let's have two, but with a friendship discount. No special rates. Collective bargaining. What? Why? -Registration, tax office, and so on, you know. Seems to be good, he's totally on it. Just hand it over. Oops. What's with the onion? It's on the house. Djambo...! Yeah, man? My money. Take the money and run, big boy! Open your hand. Get a close shot. -You like that, don't you, TV people? So let's have a Colombian-style party. -Now things are really getting started! Look what we've got here! I mean, you really think I'm stupid, right? And I still believe in Santa Claus! The debt collectors spend more time at our place than you do! Tito, I swear... Shut it, Omar. A couple of real stupid things happened. I didn't want to worry you. But I have a plan. Fuck your plan, OK? Jessica... That's all just business here, OK? That's all. So what? If you lie to me again, I'll cut off your balls... and serve them to you for breakfast. Do we understand each other? You want an interview with me? -I'd love to. Don't believe anything that asshole behind me says. As soon as he opens his mouth, there's nothing but lies. The worries even make me cry... -But you're still confident, right? Man, I know I'm hot, but I've had enough of you touching me. So what's the plan for today? Today? Business as usual. We'll cruise, get business done. My friends! How are you? Hey, Juwel, what's up? -Juwel, we're busy right now, okay? I know, that's why I'm here. I think it's really funny you're shooting a documentary with these two. And why? -Juwel, could we have a word? We're talking now, aren't we? -No, over there... You want to talk? Let's go talk. Are these your roots, you piece of shit? Look, that's just entertainment. We give them what they want. That's TV! It may be entertainment for you. Or you. But not for me. You can go back to your 1000-euro apartment. But we're still on the street, man! Don't blame others for your screwed-up life. What do you mean, "screwed-up life", you bastard? We were screwing with you, and you didn't even realise it. All the stories about the neighbourhood and the people were made up. And you stand in front of the camera and repeat all that bullshit, you idiot. Just give me two more episodes and I'll tell the truth. If you don't come clean, I will drop the bombshell and go public. Then, Omar and Tito will be dead! Got it? I'm quitting the show. I'll sort it all out. Definitely not. You have no choice but to keep going. The hell with Dr. Mate. I talked to some people at my agency. You wear it. And they pay you. Can you clean this up? We need to hear what they're saying. Let me try. We're just fucking with the television crew. I'm an actor. I'm just pretending. I'm an actor. I'm just pretending. For television. Just give me two more episodes... Did you know that? One more episode. Then you'll tell the truth. If you don't, I'll go public. Then Tito and Omar will be dead! What's our plan? Great outfit. Been shopping? Forget shopping. That's sponsoring! Superstar. It's normal. What about you, Omar? Got a sponsor, too? Screw sponsoring. Screw his... mother... screw sponsoring, I fuck all their mothers. All of them. Their mothers? By the way, I'd like to talk to your mother. My mother? I'm gonna... screw... Hey, just calm down, alright? The ratings were fantastic. We just have to raise the game a little. So I thought we could get a little more personal. That's why I want to talk to your mother. My mother has major... psychological problems. And your father? My father is... dead. He died long ago. What about you, Tito? What does your mother do? Cleaning woman. Yugo. Normal. Your mother's dead. -Oh really? I know my mother's dead. But the story needs this. The story needs a bit more plausibility. It's all too much. Why? Yugos are really into cleaning. It's something they do well. What kind of child was Tito? Tito? Which Tito? Tito died. Years ago. Oh... him. Always outside. In the park. All day. With all the other kids. Like gypsies. All day in the park. Was he a good boy or a naughty boy? Did he often get into fights? He was always good and very bad, but... you know, when Papa tell him something, he won't do it. But when Papa no tell him, he do everything. You understand? Well, yes. Sometimes Mama forgets things. The mugs are here. -Oh, here. I forget... because of the detergent. All day detergent, headaches. You need drink coffee? Excuse me? -You want drink coffee? Yes, I'd love some. Thank you. Wait a minute. I must drink coffee, too. I have sedative. And... what are you drinking? I have given it a name, relax coffee. It's for me, a special medicine. So it's coffee but relaxing at the same time? Exactly. Yes, it's very... peaceful. And school? How was he? -He was good at school. But everyday problems! We have so many problems in this family, and every day, the psychologist, the psychologist called me. And my husband always went to police. I cry, every day I cry. He was always at the police. Psychologist always calling me. Now I have to drink more coffee. Mama is a bit tired now. No, with the relax coffee I can do everything. I clean everything up. Tip-top. Yes, just have another sip. Tito's mother Romana separated from her husband, who left the two of them. Not only alcohol, but physical and psychological violence were common in Tito's family. Fuck his mother, he beat me up every day because of that slut! Tito wasn't alone in his struggle with parental neglect, corporal punishment, and a fragmented educational history. Bitter truths that shape the lives of many immigrant kids. As well as Omar's and Tito's. A rival gang, led by ex-convict Cevher Toprak, known as "Juwel"... Juwel, you gotta see this. has problems with Omar and Tito's activities. The convicted criminal Juwel spent several years behind bars for armed robbery. What? A disagreement about business arises between Juwel, Omar and Tito. What's this bitch talking about! Whether it's about protection money, the division of business in the neighbourhood, or about Tito and Omar's contribution to the TV show remains unclear. Hello there. -Not now, please. Not now. Should I come back later? Look, the mood here is tense enough. And we don't want to blow things up even more. What do you mean? Well, your program. You made us look stupid... and we don't need that here, got it? And next time you come, buy something. And now please move along. Fresh, fresh, fresh. Yesterday fresh, today fresh... Who threatened you? It's just a short interview... I just don't want any problems. Get lost, you scum! So... what now? Now it's time for some calls. Hey friends, what's up! Hey, Omar Sharif! Give me the newspaper. Hey man, you're even in the papers! No way, let me have a look. Look at that face! Hans, gimme the money! -Please, no! Let's go, boys. The breakers won't wait forever. Sara, wait! What? What's wrong? -Nothing. But keep away from me and the boys. Wait a minute. Why? -Why? Just look at yourself. Don't you realise the boys worship you? You know what really happens here? What some people have been through? But we have you two, acting like gangsters. It's really embarrassing, Omar. Just keep away from us. Let's go, boys! Have I ever violated any requirements? No! We received a phone call from somebody, claiming you employ workers illegally. Well, that's just not true! -Don't you worry, Mr. Oncel, you're not the only one, we're checking everyone here. I'm going to look around a bit in here. Yes, you look around. I have nothing to hide. If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear. Yes. Do what you have to do. Abi, what's going on here? That man is from the council. And what's that got to do with me? Listen, all that nonsense your friends said on television... They're not my friends. What friends? Thanks to them I've got the authorities hassling me. What's that got to do with me? Listen, I don't need any trouble here, alright? I don't need no criminals and underworld bosses. So just get lost. But I need the job! -There is no more job. Hello Mr. Oktay. -Hello, you again? I'm here to help. I heard you've got some problems? Have you heard about all these check-ups? Everything is a mess here. Has it affected you in any way? They don't trust us. We're just not a part of society. Bullshit. We just have to keep our feet on the ground. Stay put. Until things calm down. Why? Sometimes you dish it out, sometimes you get dished out. I only hand it out. Nobody around here wants to take me on. If you know what I mean. Shit man, what is wrong with you? Get a close-up. -No, we won't do a close-up! What is this? What kind of example are you? You think that's cool, huh? What's wrong, man? -You're such a victim, fuck that shit. Fuck it. I'm out. -I'll sort it out. Wait a sec. Are you crazy? They're starting to wonder. What's the deal with the gun, huh? It's an airgun, relax. It's part of the show. I quit. Yes, sure. Don't ever forget why we're doing this. It was your idea. And that's why I'm saying we stop. We've made fools of people for long enough. It's time to be honest. Time to be honest? Then tell me why you really want to stop? Jealous 'cause I'm the star now? We haven't been honest for a long time. You don't get it, do you? You're doing this for the money, not because of me. Right. Because I have a family. And you're really good at taking care of them, especially your father, right? Mind your own shit, would you? -Exactly, my shit. From the start I said I would call it quits at some point. Or I'd never get any respect as an actor. And you knew that, Marko! Can I tell you a secret? You're no Robert De Niro. And you'll never be one. So could we please carry on? Hey! Where are you going, you bastards?! Drive! Just drive! Critical voices already compare Rudolfsgrund to similar areas in Brussels, Paris and the Neukölln district of Berlin. And there is even uncertainty now about the renovation planned by the council... You have a message from Extras Agency. Shall I read it? Benny, the director saw the series. Now he wants you back. He says you're incredible. So when can you have coffee with him and talk about the details? Kiss! Wouldn't you like to join us after all? Herbert cooked dinner. Wild boar. He shot it himself! You must eat something. You got a cigarette for me? -What? You got a cigarette for me? -No, I don't smoke. Can you lend me 10 euros? -I don't have 10 euros. What are you listening to? Give me your phone! No, I won't! Give me your phone! I'm not giving you anything. iPhone 4? Get out of here! You'll get what's coming to you, you bastards... WELFARE AGENCY Hard luck, you son of a bitch? You piece of shit. Come to daddy! Come here, Khan. My boy! Do you have a name yet? I came here by train when I was 20 years old. The only thing I had was a piece of paper with an address. I started with nothing. Nothing! Not that story again... Quiet! I'm the one talking now. You know what the city would be like if there weren't people like us? What this district would be like without us? The city wouldn't function. No city in the world would function. Mr. Bilic. Running away won't do you any good. It just makes everything worse. Close the door. Don't worry, that's my problem. Right, it's your problem. You think you can do everything by yourself. But that's not how life works. We're in it together, and you need to understand that. Together! Mr. Bilic... what's that? That's my life. I've been saving my whole life. Dad! Son! People, people! Just a minute, alright? Why are the immigrants always to blame when something goes wrong? Maybe because it's always you people! Since people started coming from the East, we've had lots more drug niggers and prostitutes. Watch your language! -Just watch the TV show. Could we be a bit more civilized and cut out the "nigger" bit? Please. We came here because we have to find a way together. What kind of way? What are you talking about? Otherwise we can forget about the renovation of the district. And why? Because the mob attacks a neutral TV crew. Neutral? What are you talking about? We work by the sweat of our brow. We work honestly. We work hard. And who do they film? The criminals! And we're shown in the wrong light. We can't let things escalate now. Well yes, but it already happened. This is not the Wild West here. If you think you're above the law you'll be punished. Are we supposed to let them put us down? -Please stop, let's keep calm. You don't have any idea at all what we should do, do you? But we know. Wait a minute. That's just crazy. Please everybody, just a minute. Only a minute. We know we screwed up. But we're on your side. And we really didn't have any idea that the woman from the TV... would make everything look much worse than it really is. But you went along with that for long enough. And made enough money. You should be in prison. Both of you! Okay... nobody made any money. That's bullshit. Thanks for agreeing with me, finally! You two are just as much to blame as the cow from the TV! You're absolutely right. But now we really do have a plan. And that's why we need your help. Are you completely out of your mind!? That's burglary, trespassing, fraud and- Alright, Klara, just tell us. Please. This is our only chance. First of all, you have to get past the reception, which is impossible without an appointment. Then you have to ingest your material. In...? -Ingest. Load. On an editing suite. But you won't get one just like that. They're constantly in use. Actually you have to get rid of the editor somehow and use his account. In the highly unlikely scenario that you've made it that far, you have to get into the broadcast control room somehow. That one has video surveillance. It's impossible to get in there. You can forget about doing anything Mission Impossible style. You could also just walk in and say: "Hello, here we are!" What's up, doorman guy? Stop right there. Where do you think you're going? Whom do you want to see? -What are you talking about? As if you didn't know us! What's wrong, man? Headaches, major psycho problems or what? We're "Rudolfsgrund: Life in the Ghetto". And we're here for salary negotiations, my friend! You can't smoke in here. What? Your rules are just empty words turning into thin air when they leave your mouth. Bang, man! We have to go. You have to work. We have a show waiting for us. Rudolfsgrund for life, bro! Did he swallow that? -Did you see his face? Sure he did. Now where, Klara? Alright. Which "south"? Horst? We have two idiots in the building. One of them is smoking, the other's pants are too tight. To the machine room. Fourth or fifth door on floor 1, to the right. Is this even the right floor? You can leave that. Excuse me, can't you see we're working? Sorry. I have so much work. So many projects. Me too. Yes, but can you come back later? -I don't have time. Have to carry on working. What's up, television people? I like your hairstyle, brilliant. Quinn, how are things looking? -I'm already there. At last, a schnitzel! -Great. Thanks! Schnitzel, at long last. Enjoy! Are you serious? She's getting on my nerves. Let's go grab a coffee. -Did you save? Come on in! We're in the editing room. Now what? Insert the USB stick and import the clip into the project. Hurry up! -Fucking pants. And now? Now what? -Drag and drop, how about that! Get a move on. You only have 8 minutes left. Please, I must clean here. Wait! Klara. Somebody's in the machine room. Now you've got to be convincing, Benny. I'm on it. Please... Jesus, you a ninja or what? -What? No. Look, this is today's "Rudolfsgrund". We have to check it. I mean, approve it. Technically. Like, lightning fast. What do you mean, "lightning fast"? It's already been approved. And Quality Control is full. You can come back in an hour and a half. Anything else? Listen up, boy. When I tell you to check the fucking material, you check it. And if you don't check it... I'll tell your brother. And then your brother will sort you out! Ferdl? -Yes. Ferdl. You want me to call him and tell him what you're doing in the machine room? No, no, that's all right. Alright. But please don't call Ferdl. I'll think about it. Carry on. Is this the room? You sure the guys are still in there? Klara, you have to get us into that room! It's the transmission center. Video surveillance. Looks like these guys can eat nails! But you have to stay in the transmission room! No! -What the fuck is wrong with you? Shit... my ass is about to explode. One minute left... Switch the programs in the stream. -What...? Where...? Which bloody monitor? What you mean 'easy'? Klara... which one of the 4 million buttons? Quick, quick! Benny, swap the programs! Klara, there are two, which one is it? Benny, swap the programs now! Where, Klara, where? Where does it go? No... Ghettobang... WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION. For the love of God... I just got torn apart. Wait... the program is not in the queue. Now it's fine. Are we on? Welcome to "Rudolfsgrund: Life in the Ghetto." In today's special episode we want to explain something. People in this neighborhood have been wrongly accused of stuff. Based on rumors that we spread on TV. Let's start with Oktay. Of course nobody works for him illegally. That's bullshit! Also, the Arabic restaurant is not involved in money laundering. The owner just has a second source of income, a taxi company. There isn't any illegal boxing in the betting shop, either. I'm sure illegal boxing happens somewhere, but we just made up a story. Exactly. The kind of story TV people are very keen on. All of this is just... a good story, right? The two of us just made up everything. We're not really long-time unemployed. And I'm not a criminal who collects protection money. These rumors and preconceptions, don't take them at face value. You can't just believe anything! We know that certain stories sell better than others. When the... authorities... and this is really aimed at you... you play politics, it's not my fault. If you don't do... Keep calm, relax. People need to get the message. If you don't push through the renovations in this neighbourhood, you know what will happen? The people... will pull themselves even further away. And you know what happens then? You create a Grade A alternative society. Of course there is tension here in this neighborhood. But that's quite normal when so many cultures come into contact with each other. Everything OK? -Yes. What about you? Can we stop this? -What? No, why? Because... there's a problem with picture quality. So what? Nobody gives a shit. -No, it's really a big problem. It'll appear later. Hey, what are you doing? You can't do that! Can't we just- We're live! - Besides, this episode is brilliant! Giving them their own episode was a brilliant idea. So that's it from our side. This broadcast will probably be stopped at any moment. See you around. Rudolfsgrund for life. Ghettobang! Why say "Ghettobang" now, Benny? Can't you say something normal? People are supposed to take us seriously. What's your problem, Marko? It's my thing. Everyone will be saying it soon. Besides, I'm an actor. I have to improvise a bit, otherwise... Otherwise what? -I don't feel it. So improvise with a bit of sense. -That made sense. You're in advertising. It's like building up a brand. The whole thing's a scam! Well, yes... It's like a little bon mot in the end. -A what? A bon mot. Klara? This part was not supposed to be in the video. It still hurts? -Yes, it still hurts... Have a look inside. To embody the reality of these individuals, and even transfer control of the program to them at the end, is a contemporary intensification of the format. Consequently, the Golden Romy... in the category Best Program Idea goes to... Rudolfsgrund: Life in the Ghetto, Marlene Weizenhuber! If you would, please introduce yourself briefly. First of all, I'm not going to put any energy into this if you're not even going to take me. Got it? My name is Juwel. I grew up in Rudolfsgrund. Born in Vienna. Turkish in my heart, at home in the whole world. You people have a funny word for it... Cosmo-pilot. That's it. That's what I am. He's the one. That guy? -He's the one. I like that. That's exactly the type of story we want to hear! Well, that's why we told you. We know a thousand stories.
