Right now, I want all of you to witness some documented highlights of the boys' progress in Spudland. You will even hear them speak. - Jerry. - Alan. - Mark. - Bob one. - Bob two.

I don't know how they put these things together. - Okay, but what are we gonna do about what Rod was saying? - Well, it depends on what you mean.

(lively music) - I request your attention towards some serious thoughts. Artists and performers are usually good looking guys and gals who couldn't hold a real job. Entertainment is sometimes the excuse by which these people perpetuate their selfish hoax. I ask all of you to join Devo's efforts to correct this situation from the inside out.

There's no difference between democrats and republicans. There's a direct connection between spuds and double knit pantsuits. If the spud fits, wear it. - That's one young lad with a chip on his shoulder. But a good shoulder knows when to knock it off. At the risk of repeating myself, let me remind you. These boys are really serious.
