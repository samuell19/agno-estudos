Years ago, some girl quarreled with her boyfriend She came here And called him up, saying she would kill herself She was just trying to scare him Didn't really want to die She thought he'd rush over to save her So she cut her wrists a little But the boyfriend didn't believe her anyway And he did nothing So she died? Lots of people have seen her ghost... ...in the room where she died So the owner has changed all the room numbers And it's business as usual Why are you so scared? People say... ...if the ghost story you tell is real the ghost will appear... What are you trying to say? I'm scared! Damn you! Fool! What a scare! Let's go swimming Now?

Sorry? You say "Sorry" to me? You never say "Sorry" It means nothing! I don't mind saying it lots of times Sorry... So you do still love enough? I haven't waited in vain! So that's what he's been up to! I only question his taste She's gone... Let's help her inside Have a Coke Who's cares for one? I like to drink and enjoy myself But I don't like... ...mixing pleasure and work That's why you avoided me at the hospital Not you, I was avoiding Mrs Yeung She came back to see Aunt San Which Mrs Yeung? She was beside Aunt San at the hospital Why avoid her? Because she's died She got on well with Aunt San I always leave the lights on for them Otherwise they'd get lost How do you know Mrs Yeung comes back to see... Aunt San Right, Aunt San! How do you know? Can you see ghosts? Yes, through one eye I can see them with my left eye You don't believe me? I believe you... it's just... ...I've never seen any myself Don't they scare you? Of course they do That's why I wear dark glasses all day I fear seeing them all the time I've stuck some black tape to this side So I used to see them when I was little Luckily a priest made me an amulet It limited my vision But... The amulet's starting to lose its power Why don't you go back to that priest? I don't know where to find him now Give me back my glasses What's wrong?

Whenever I take you home... ...you don't even let me near your door! Why? Hello? Where are you now? I'll come right away I'll beat you! Curiosity killed the cat! Stay away! Dad... Maybe I dropped my report card somewhere here? I was careless, I didn't realize I'd lost it My scores weren't so bad either But they weren't so bad either Somewhere in the middle Wong Choi, as I say, one must be righteous One should admit his own mistakes I haven't achieved much myself I had little education, I don't know how to teach you But no matter what happens... ...I'll support you Because you're my son But if you dare to lie to me... ...you'll break my heart I know you like these chocolates... So I bought these for you Sorry, father Here's the report card I don't know why I did so badly in the exam Just impossible I guessed Sorry, father I miss you so much, father Don't miss me, son I'm dead already What happened? Come and change your clothes How much is malted milk? $4.50 $9 Thanks When were we last together in the shop? When you were small, you used to break things No, don't pick it up You cut yourself whenever you pick up broken glass Leave it, I'll clean it up I'll get you some ointment Sit down Let me see Will that work? Of course It healed all your cuts when you were little No, the question is... This seem to be the very same bottle How come? At you naughty tricks again! It's a shame I couldn't keep the old snake shop When did father begin to fall ill? Remember you took another kid's report card by mistake? You thought you'd done badly, you were scared to tell Dad He fell ill around the end of that year Don't you remember? It was the year of that street accident A guy's head was severed It was reported in newspapers, horrible Do you remember? Headless man in WEST POINT Does it hurt? It's birthmark, it doesn't hurt I went to see your father the night before he died and I saw a nurse staring at your father and your father was staring back at her I told you, I don't have Alzheimer's! I'm possessed! Now you say she's linked to your dad's death No Or that she's somehow linked... ...to some accident and a severed head Or that she's out to get you Isn't this all a bit far-fetched? That's all! Thanks for comforting me but I trust you In fact, I've thought about... ...going to ask her about the whole thing If you do that... ...I'll really think you've lost it Think about it! If someone wants to get you... ...would she really tell you so up from? If you ask her outright... ...you'll play right into her hands I was only thinking What if you're completely wrong? I'd say all you need to worry about... ...is finding a new job, fast! ...because you're in deep shit already, financially No, I'm in deep shit already I'll die if this goes on Don't say I didn't remind you Love and career can come together any time Carmen! What a coincidence! Oh, come on I'll have a beer Carmen, you timed it just right You've found him a job, right? Right Why not sit down and chat I'll talk to the girls Hey, have you thought over? What? What else? Of course the job Yes... Yes... I'm interested There's one thing I must tell you I don't know how to say this... It's related to you So I really ought to tell you I know... It's good you know Let's go to your home To my home? The interview's tomorrow, I should coach you for it That'll give you a better chance This is it Cut this hair style for me You must make it at the interview tomorrow Thanks I'm brave to let you cut my hair I hope you understand I understand OK, I'll begin Come on Come on, I haven't got long Excuse me That thing... it's here! The ghost from the housing estate, I told you about it I think it's here to get you I think it has come to do you harm What did you say? You'd better be careful Carmen, Siu-Kam Siu-Kam, why don't you go first? Good Don't go, there's no need Siu-Kam, why don't you leave? Why? But you're really in danger You'd better leave You're really in danger now! It's most dangerous to be with you! Ever since we met... ...there's been one strange thing after another Sorry Sorry to bother you, I'll leave now What is it? You... What are you doing? Are you alright? How come? What... have you been up to? Why must you do this? No... it's not me I never want to see you again Are you a ghost or not? Answer me You are crazy You shout at me so you are not a ghost, right? Why are you wearing like this? Look at your shoes and the umbrella... And you just look like a dead people... Why would wear like this I just had my dancing class and I am going home now People are scared of you because of your dressing This is so horrible Look you dress weird, too... This is your problem Why are shouting at me Simon Stop a while Did you tell her you have AIDS? Shit! Looks like I'm even scarier than AIDS Sure you are! What is it now? It's Siu-Kam She played a loan shark last time It's happened again? Hang on, weren't you with Carmen? Yes, anyway... Now she's painted the whole place red So serious? We can't go home now I think it's time to visit my ma She catches ghosts? I never knew My ma sells electronic gear to tourists She cheats foreigners, she doesn't catch ghosts! So why do you want to see her? We have to sleep somewhere! Would you rather sleep in the street? What are you looking at? Frankly, at you... Am I so horrible? Not too horrible at first ...but it's scary when you shout Even so, why don't you start the car? You won't take us? Man, times are hard, how could I refuse you? The problem is, I have two flat tyres Then why did you stop here? I can't move, I have to stop here And you two happened along You could have stopped us getting in How could I stop you both rushing in? How could I stop you talking nonstop? I couldn't get a word in edgewise You be careful I hate taxi drivers most! Mind my door, man! My parents must have gone to China So we have the house to ourselves I'm gonna buy shares in a 7-Eleven, interested? Shares in 7-Eleven? Some sign of life at least I thought you'd turned to stone Of course not Take a shower, freshen up OK? Simon? What's wrong? Did Siu-Kam do this? Are you OK? Of course I'm OK I asked you if Siu-Kam did this to you It was you! What? It was you! You pushed me down! Me? You looked horrible just now You were a different person Don't you remember? Tell me what happened An hour ago I bought back some drinks... And found you painting the place red I asked what the hell you were doing Peter, what are you doing? None of your business! Peter, it's me... It's me! Then you came down and asked me Simon, what are you doing? Did Siu-Kam do this? That's all I have a feeling the red paint last time... ...maybe Siu-Kam didn't do it Maybe it was you So I've been wrong about Siu-Kam? Not necessarily Maybe you did it under her influence Come on I just hope not Doesn't it hurt to go on like that? What do you mean? Talking helped me to forget the pain Are you going? You haven't blacked out, and you have a phone with you Dial for an ambulance yourself Well that makes sense Who are you looking for? Siu-Kam Siu-Kam? No such person! But she lives here I said, no such person here! June... I am looking for June June? I recognize you now Who... are you? I'm Peter, June's friend I'm also June's friend I'm her good friend Come in I'm Kow Mother and I live next door June is my buddy If anyone bullies her ...I'll stand up for her Haven't seen a beauty before? Kei-Kei, she's June's friend Big deal! This is June's room I recognize you now! Don't beat me... Don't beat me, I didn't mean it Where's June? She's not in? I remember now, she went up to the roof... ...to hang clothes to dry Drying clothes at this time of night? Of course, you only dry clothes on the roof What else? Stupid! I can't go up to the roof with you Mom wouldn't let me Then sit here and don't run about Don't leave me, I really love you Go away! Stop! Peter? What if I don't stop? I'll teach you a lesson if you don't! Peter! What if we begin again? I'll believe in whatever you say from now on, OK? You're crazy! Trust me Give me back my head... He seems to be possessed Are you sure? You've just said you'll believe whatever I say! But it's hard to make me believe this Give me back my head! Help! He really is possessed! That doesn't mean you have to hit my head! Give me back my head! My head hurts! It's me! What are you doing? So pretending being possessed works! Crazy! Sorry, I didn't trust you It's luckily you were here But I have to ask you one thing What is it? Why were you staring at my father at the hospital? How come you know? I've asked you before Never mind, someone saw you Why exactly? Frankly... I really don't know You don't know? Impossible You were staring at him for a long time... You don't know? I didn't know your father at all I learnt afterwards that he was your father I only found his eyes very familiar I felt I'd seen them somewhere before At the street accident in West Point 15 years ago Were you there? 15 years ago? I feel that... ...all these strange things recently are linked to it If I tell you I've lost all the memory of my childhood ...will you believe me? OK, come with me Only that priest can help us now, I think You found him? The one who drew the amulet for you? Yes This is it Where is he? Crazy Why are you laughing? Girlie, don't you ever take a shit? Still laughing? You're the priest who can exorcise ghosts? Have some tea In fact... ...She used to be scared because she often saw ghosts So I just drew her an amulet Just something to comfort her, to ease her fear After I was sent to prison... You see, I was a pimp Worked for a brothel After I was sent to prison Girlie here sent word to me... ...that my amulet really worked! In fact, I don't know a thing I just scribbled something for her Anyone who gets rid of ghosts is an exorcist You can do that, so you do have the power She said so again and again Finally I started to believe it myself So I turned professional So that's what you were doing the other day? You saw me? I didn't see you So you were the guy they beat up, Kow told me How come you were there? It's a long story It's not important... anyway I'll explain to you later In fact I'm an atheist who uses religion to turn a buck Kind of swindler I just give the people what they want Many, many people believe in me There're no ghosts in this world indeed People just make things up He doesn't even believe in ghosts! How can he help us? We're here not to discuss this You keep asking stupid questions I only want to know... ...how did you find me that day? He picked me up in the streets Picked you up? Are you alright? Why are you asking this? I want to know OK, use this plastic bag What's that for? I'll begin Why a plastic bag? I remember that day, I had nothing to do... I walked around... ...and fond myself in West Point There was a serious street accident Someone was knocked down and killed His head was severed A headless man? That came up well! Need another plastic bag? Girlie, are you OK? Then I'll go on By the time I got there... ...the ambulance had already left And I know is what heard from onlookers They said the car knocked the victim's head off And the man's body staggered some way before it fell His head was under the tram I guess people exaggerated the details Anyhow, I saw girlie crying alone on the sidewalk I asked her name but she didn't know how to answer I asked where she lived, she said she didn't know I took pity and brought her home Soon I learnt she lost her memory You couldn't remember anything... ...when he brought you home? So if you could recall what happened... ...the whole thing could be explained! What is it? That thing... He has come? You're seeing those things again? What exactly do you want? Say, what exactly do you want? Peter, what's wrong with you? Didn't you say he's here? I was too frightened just now, I couldn't move He was just next to me Girlie, he was next to you then... Where is he now? There's nothing to fear about ghosts If you don't harm them, they won't harm you I have no quarrel with him... May heaven be with me! Obey my order! Whoever disobeys must perish! You say he has no power? He may be doing incantations... ...but that doesn't mean he has power Give me back my head... No! I can't leave the priest! The priest is not his target He'll be alright if we leave, hurry! Run! Run! Six for $100 Or $20 each Don't look back? Run! Look out! Priest? How come I'm here? Girlie, why are you staring at me this way? Don't tell me that thing is here again I said it wouldn't spare us Run! Only the girl sees it Maybe they're in this together, to scare me? Don't be afraid... Is he after us? I have to catch my breath, whatever happens I feel that he won't spare us tonight Come Siu-Kam? Who are you? What exactly do you want? What exactly do you want? Leave her alone, get me if you dare! Come get me! Siu-Kam! Peter! Someone's been knocked over! You're the one? The one under the tram? Maybe he pushed you... ...but you can't blame his son! Spare him Nothing to do with his son? We collect debts, whoever owes us money... ...will bring harm to his family He owes your money? He owes me my head! I beg you, spare him! Wait! I... I'm starting to remember He didn't push you! It was really an accident? I... I've been getting you wrong, please forgive me Getting me wrong? How? Nothing... Yeah, we'd better forget the past Not necessarily Sweet memories can be cherished Last time you... ...you dropped it and I picked it up for you It's mine? It was a gift from me You gave it to me? I gave you this when we went kite-flying I flew a kite with you? Don't you remember anything? You've forgotten it all? Madam, what are you doing here? She was my daughter I'm visited her grave Your daughter? She killed herself in Cheung Chau... ...over some worthless man Grave of Wong Siu-Kam This was her favourite song I play it for her every time I come Do you miss me?
