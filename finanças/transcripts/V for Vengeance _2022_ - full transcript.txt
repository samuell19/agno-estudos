Time is a tricky thing. A day, a moment, a fraction of a second can alter the trajectory of your life forever. Three, two, one. You ready? Here we go! Go! My sisters and I were so damn happy. Yes, sisters. Adopted, obviously. But the same thing that brought us together... is what tore us apart... ...our blood. That day, our lives were forever changed by a single, tragic moment that none of us saw coming. Hey, Bubbles? You hungry? Yeah, me too. Hang tight, okay? You know the drill. I'll be back. Oh, my God! Hey there, sunshine. Having trouble? Yeah... Um... My boyfriend and I broke up, and then, uh, I started crying. All of the sudden, my... my eyes started getting all blurry, and then... I think I ran over like, an armadillo or a possum, or something. Hey, there's no need to cry there, princess. Your chariot awaits. Hop in. Thanks! Dear God... So... what'd that shitheel boyfriend of yours do anyway? He went back to his wife. A home wrecker, huh? Yep. That's me. Yeah. My kind of trouble. Why are we slowing down? Don't play games with me. You know why. Don't play games. You know you want this. Yeah, that's gonna be a no. Get over here. Come on. I said, no. Sorry, sugartits. I might be able to hear you with your mouth full. Fuck. Can you hear me now, you fuck? Looking for the hospital? Room, please. Two nights. Credit card and I.D., please. Room six. Extra towels. I'll get some sent up. Cool. Hey, Bubbles. Morning, Bubbles. Fuck. I'll be back for the fish. He dies, you die. Yes, Ma'am. Good instincts. Hey there, kiddo. You need a ride? Yeah, do you mind? No. Would love the company. Well, I'm Frank. Jasmyn. With a "Y". Very nice to meet you, Jasmyn with a "Y". But why... are you out here all alone? You know it's not safe to hitchhike. My boyfriend and I had a fight. Ah, jeez. Sorry to hear that. I was just so upset. I ju... I told him to pull over and let me out. Well, you know, a pretty girl like you, he'd better apologize something quick, or another fella will just come in and... ...snap you right up! You think? Yeah. I sure do. Thanks. So... Phew. It's hot in here. Well, I run nothing but cool. It's a family trait. Um... are you out here for work? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Actually, I, uh... I just got promoted. Deputy regional manager of the whole northwest district. Yeah. We, uh... we do industrial valves. Mm. You must get really lonely you know out here all by yourself. Oh, yeah, yeah. I suppose it can, yeah. But at least I've got my uh.. Podcasts... "How To Make Friends And Keep Them." Wow. Uh... you know, if you're tired, we can pull over. Go to a motel or something. No. No, I'm good. Yeah. Just got my second wind. I need to make it to the E.E. by sunrise, so... Oh, sorry, that's industry talk for Extrusion Expo. Well... We don't have to sleep. Excuse me. Just one sec. Hi, sweetie. How's it goin' there, Poppa bear? Good, good... Actually, I, uh... - I just made a new friend. - Nice! Well, I have someone here who really wants to talk to you! Hi, Daddy. I miss you! I'm doing a puzzle with Mom. You know what, Jocelyn, there's... there's just nothing like your own blood. Hi, pumpkin. Yeah, Daddy misses you, too. So much. And you're doing a puzzle? Wow. Such a smart girl. Daddy really loves you and misses you. I can't wait to see you again. Oh! Good Lord! Uh... Uh, honey, I'm... I'm gonna... I'm gonna have to call you back. Okay, all right. Aw, shit. Well, I didn't see that one coming. Hi. I'm sorry. Um, do you mind if I get a ride? It's just, I have seizures so I can't really drive, and I'm just freaking out. This is a nice car. I'm Pepper. What's your name? Emma, we need to talk. Scarlett? Fuck. Not today. Emma! Emma, come back here! Emma! Goddamn it, Scarlett! Do you know how expensive this jacket is? It's vintage. Emma, if you would fucking listen to me... Real mature, Emma. Did you just push me? Looks like. I hate being pushed. You suck! Don't push me. I hate being pushed. Mom! She pushed me! Because I won! Hey, girls, no more fighting. Listen to your mother. Getting rusty, huh? Does that smell like rust to you? Looks like someone's been brushing up on their Wing Chun. Oh, you noticed? Are you insane? It's not silver, you idiot. You're the idiot. The Kuk... Sool Won kick. Emma, I wouldn't have shot you if it wasn't important. What could be that important? Kate's alive. No, darling. Practice your English. I have bad news. It seems that the youngest of the Addison sisters is still alive. She's been working on her parents' vaccine, and, apparently, she has cracked the code. Now, that's unfortunate. Call our friend. Tell him to find her and to bring her to me. Alive. And get me another glass of blood. What can I get you ladies? Can I get the steak and eggs and coffee? But you can hold the steak and eggs and just bring the coffee. And same for her. Thank you. So, you don't have anything to say? I'm still trying to process, okay? That's a lot of information to take in. Look, Emma, I know that you're mad at me. Mad is not the emotion I'm feeling right now. Rage? Getting warmer. I begged you to stay with me. And I begged you to come with me. You made your choice. What was I supposed to do? I can't live the way you do. And how's that? Living in squalor, hitchhiking across the desert, dressing like a five-dollar hooker. Okay, first of all, this jacket is real leather and costs 600 dollars. And second... at least I kill with a conscience. Oh, my God, would you get over it? Killing Josh was an accident. I wasn't talking about Josh. But since you brought that up. How was that an accident? You shouldn't have been feeding on him in the first place. I didn't mean to kill him! Coffee. Thank you. Killing him was an accident, all right? I'm only human. No, you're not. Well, I was once, and that has to count for something. Besides, he was fucking cheating on you. Mm-hmm, yeah, he did, with you. That was after he slept with the slut in the Subway, so it doesn't count. Oh, my God. God! You know, you don't have to be dick whipped by every fucking guy you sleep with, all right? Sometimes, sex is just sex. You know what, I don't have to take this shit. No, no, no, no, no. Wait. Please. Sit down. Please, please. Please don't leave again. What are you doing? We need to leave now, while they're still feeding. Why? What's going on? Those were innocent people they killed tonight, Scarlett. Well, we have to eat, Emma. Yes, but they normally bring back bad people, like rapists and murderers. Never innocent people. What we just saw was fucked up. Please, sit down. Fuck. You panicked and ran that day. Funny how we choose to remember things differently. You know he's going to want us to hunt innocents, right? - Fuck that. - Well, I'm sure Thorn has his reasons. Let's just go talk to him. Talk to him? Are you crazy? He just manipulated us into bringing those people here tonight. Their blood is on our hands! It's because of Thorn. He saved our lives, Emma. He gave us a home. Doesn't that count for something? Let's just tell him we don't want to be hunters. How do you think he's expecting us to earn our keep? We knew exactly what Thorn was grooming us for. I wasn't going to stick around for that. We're all family here. Where would we go? Anywhere but here. You know we can fend for ourselves, right? These people are fucking evil. I just feel like... I feel like something bad is gonna happen. Scarlett, you have to make up your mind. It's either Thorn or me. I just can't, Emma. I'm sorry. This is my home. You're a fucking coward. Fuck you, Emma. Did you just push me? I hate being pushed. That's not how it went down, Emma. Okay. Obviously, we're not going to agree on anything today. Um, can I have more coffee, please? How did you find out about Kate? Fucking Tatiana. Hello, yes. The youngest of the Addison sisters survived. Kate. Find her. Bring her here, alive. Whatever it takes. I knew it. I told you, I told you! We can't trust Thorn. It wasn't Thorn, it was Tatiana. Uh-huh, yeah. Tatiana is Thorn's bitch. Oh, my god. Okay. You know what, just keep going, please. Uh! What happened to Kate? Kate, hurry up, sweetie. Okay, we're going to play hide and seek, okay? All right. Is Emma and Scarlett playing, too? Yes, Emma and Scarlett are playing, too. Now, remember, this is our hiding spot, just like we practiced. But I want to hide with them. Listen to me. This is not up for debate. Mom, you're scaring me. I know, honey. I'm scared, too, but you have to listen to me, okay? Now, Teddy will protect you. You hold on him tight, always. Now, hurry up. Get in there. Don't move until I come back and get you, okay? Yeah. And you be super quiet, no matter what you hear. Do you understand? Yes. I love you, Kate. I love you, Mommy. Okay, do you remember the first day we went to Thorn's? Sire. Look at these poor little girls. These are the last two alive. Their family was brutally murdered. Mom! Mom! Dad! Mom! It's up to you to decide their fate. Welcome. You are safe. This will be your new home. And we are your family now. We were never safe. Oh, my God, Emma, it wasn't always bad. There were still times when we got to be kids. Remember when we built that fort in the living room? Tatiana was so pissed. We used her designer sheets as a tent. But we were fighting an imaginary bear. So. That was your idea, by the way. Yeah. The tent did get destroyed. Fucked up her sheets. Oh, my God, she was so mad. She was fucking pissed. Uh! That was Kate's favorite thing to do too. What? Camp in the living room. Oh, yeah. She loved it. So what's the plan? Where do you think she is? I just have a rough idea, but I think that she's hiding out with our parents' friend. He's a legendary vampire hunter named Bulls eye. Hey, little one. You're okay. You're safe now. I'm a friend of your parents. I'm one of the good guys. Come on, you're safe now. Come on, let's go. Let's go. It's a good place to start. I can't believe Kate's alive. I know. But we have to find her before whoever Tatiana sent gets to her first. Are you in? Of course, I'm fucking in. Let's go get our baby sister. And then, we get those bloodsuckers that did this to us. Oh, cheers to that. I need a real drink. Ah! Oh, yeah. That was not good. Two whiskeys. Well... how have you been getting by? You mean feeding? Uh, kids mostly. Sometimes grandmas. Yeah, not funny. No, just have a steady diet of rapists and psychos. Sometimes, the occasional pedophile priest. I just figure if I have to kill people, might as well make the world a better place, you know? Then you have, like, possums and raccoons and stuff. - That sucks. - Yep. Do you ever think about what it was like before this? All the time. We had our whole lives ahead of us. I hate what we've become. We do what we have to, to survive. - Mom and Dad would be mortified. - Yeah... I mean, I hate myself. I've tried to kill myself so many times, but vampires can't commit suicide. Can't commit suicide. I learned that the hard way. Me too. Do you remember anything from that day? Fragments. I can't remember anything. Not a single memory. It's all gone. Probably a good thing. You just blocked them out. Yeah... but even my memories of Mom and Dad, they're all fading, and that terrifies me. I really just wish you came with me that day. Whiskey, please. The cheap stuff. Same. Hey, hey. Clearly, the lady's thirsty. Could you make that a double? Get me a beer, too. Hello, pretty girl. The name's Carl. No, thank you, Carl. I'm sorry? I said, no. Well, maybe I'm not the type to take no for an answer. Okay. How about fuck off? Ooh, I'm sorry. Didn't realize I was talking to such a cunt. I'm not being a cunt, I just want you to leave me alone. Must be a feminazi or something, huh? Doesn't need a man in her life. Maybe she's a carpet muncher. She asked you to leave her alone. I wasn't talking to you, Sir Galahad. Why don't you mind your own business? I'm pretty sure it's you who isn't minding his own business. What are you, her mother? Yeah. You're going to be calling me "Mommy" soon, too, if you're not careful. Now I'm going to respectfully ask you one more time to back off. Well, how about I respectfully shove my fist up your dick? Hmm. Appreciate the visual. If you don't back off by the time I count to three, I can't guarantee you won't spend a month in the hospital. One, two... I'd apologize on behalf of the entire human race, but... I'm not sure he's a member. Apology accepted. It's not necessary, though. I'm Emma. Marcus. Nice to meet you. Uh, can I have two whiskeys, please? So, obviously, you've trained. What are you, Special Ops? Something like that. No, just serving our country. Two tours of Iraq. Oh! Nice to know chivalry isn't dead. Oh, you were defending yourself quite well. I just thought... I wasn't being sarcastic. So, when you're not serving our country, what are you doing? Working for my dad. Wants me to take over his business. That's exciting. It's not. But I love my dad, and... it's getting hard for him. Is there a Mrs. Marcus? No. It's been a while. Why? What's wrong with you? Maybe I'm just too picky. That so? Oh! Fuck! I don't normally say this, but that was great. I've seen some films. Actually, it's been a long time for me. My work makes it pretty hard to meet people. So, what do you do? Or is it like a if-you-tell-me- you-have-to-kill-me kind of thing? Something like that. What the hell? You have no reflection. Are you a vampire? Okay, okay, don't freak out, all right? I'm a good vampire. Oh, like that's a thing. It is, it is, in my case. Um... Was that you? The truck driver that went missing? Yeah, but in my defense, that guy was a total slimeball. Yeah. He was a known pedophile. And the pig in the bar is a murderer. You're a hunter? I thought you said you work for your dad? I do. We do all kinds of bounties... rapists, psychopaths, escaped cons... Sounds familiar. And the occasional vampire. But anyway, why didn't you just tell me you were a vampire? Oh, yeah. That's a good way to start a relationship. "Oh, hi. By the way, um, I'm a blood sucker. Do you wanna hold claws and walk on the beach?" Actually sounds kind of romantic. Hold on. What the hell happened to you? I just got my ass kicked by a vampire who was definitely looking for Kate. Marcus? Oh, my God, please don't tell me you slept with this guy. And? Let me guess. "My work makes it really hard to meet people"? You must do this all the time. No. Actually, my work makes it pretty hard to meet people. You slept with my sister? She's a vampire, too, you idiot. Oops. You know, for a vampire hunter, your undead radar is kinda like glitchy. Uh-huh. Why is it every single guy I like, you either fuck or feed on? For what it's worth, I thought you and I actually had a really nice connection. Oh, shut up. Shut up. Let's just kill him. Yup. Okay, okay. This guy's FVC. Federal Vampire Control? Agent Frank Barstow. Frank? Hello, Jasmyn with a "Y". You fucked this guy, too? No. Did you? No. I don't even know him. No, I.. I just got a ride from him, that's all. I was going to kill him, but then all that pumpkin, Poppa Bear shit... Wait, did you make that up? It's my cover, and my wife happened to call when I was on the job. Frank, did you just try to put a silver bullet in me? Yeah. You know, I... It's my job to kill vampires. We are good vampires! Oh, yeah. Like that's a thing. Frank, do you know a legendary vampire hunter named Bulls eye? That's classified information. He lives in an old, abandoned machine factory in Red Valley off Dodge Road. That wasn't so hard. Yeah. Thanks, Poppa Bear. Stay out of our way. We're going to go kill some vampires, too. So, I thought maybe you guys could use a little help? From a human? Hey, he was pretty handy back there. No fucking way. You're going to have to drive all night and I do have impeccable night vision. See? Okay, then. Well... good luck, ladies. Take care. Oh, fuck... Okay, yeah, the car is sick, but I still don't trust him. Okay. We'll see. - Still get shotgun, though. - Hey! Grab the stuff, no problem. Sure, I'll carry all the stuff. Got a hat. Just like magic. Well, does it work? At least it does on here. Your parents would be proud, little one. Here we go. Okay. Just like magic! Just like magic. You see how special you are? All three of you. But we won't know until the human trials. Well, you've got a human right here. What? I'm not going to do that. Are you kidding? I'm invincible. But if you turn me into a vampire, just kill me. Are you sure? Yeah. Fine. It's gonna hurt, so I need you to sit back, relax, and don't move. Yes, Mom. I'm telling you right now, I'm not killing you... even if I do turn you into a vampire. Hold still. Oh, my God! Are you okay? Bulls eye! Bulls eye! Are you okay? Oh, my God! I'm kiddin'. I'm all right. That's not funny. Oh, it was to me. Get out of my lab. Look who knows so much. Doesn't look like anyone's here. Isn't that exactly how you'd want your secret hideout to look? Good point. I got this. Who is it? Vampires. I can tell by their heat signature. You weren't gonna feed on me back there, were you? I thought about it... after I found out you had sex with my sister. Sorry about that. It was different with her. It was more... Transactional? Yeah, I guess so. She's transactional about a lot of things. Eat shit. You're still an asshole. Hey! If you can hear us, we're looking for our sister, Kate. Hello! We're looking for our sister! Come on, let's go. Oh, just hold your horses, Speedy. Kate? Scarlett? Emma? You know these vampires? They're my sisters. I'll be damned. I just can't believe it's you. I... I have so many questions I want to ask you. I don't even know where to start. We thought you were dead. I thought you both were dead. Well, uh... technically, uh, they are. What? Oh, I get it. You... girls want to catch up with one another. Come on, Marcus. Let's go make a fire. All right, ladies. We'll leave you to it. Sit, come on. So, tell me. What... what's your life like? Any special someone? I live in a hideout with a legendary vampire hunter. I have my books and my research. That's about it. Some other weird shit. What about you guys? Marcus seems nice. Is he with one of you? Mm... Marcus is all right. He comes in handy sometimes. I bet. Hey! Look at you. Look how grown-up you are! Okay, go. Wait. So... that day... you were turned? Yeah. A vampire named Thorn took us in. - He looked after us. - Scarlett and I have a difference of opinion on that. What was it like being turned? Confusing. And painful. Kind of felt like we were being... ripped apart and then turned inside out. I've never heard of a V-type being turned before. I'd like to get samples of your blood, if that's okay. Sure. I know Mom was using our blood for something back in the day, but she never told us what. Why are we special? Oh... Kate, you and your sisters have a very rare blood type, and you should be so proud. Do you know that your blood is going to save the lives of many, many people? There's a lot you need to know. Bullseye's a good storyteller. I'll let him tell you. Back in the day before I became an infamous vampire hunter, I worked with your parents as a military geneticist. At that time, the U.S. government commissioned us to develop a vaccine that would eradicate this... vampire epidemic worldwide. The program is called "Project V". The program required a rare blood type. That's where we come in. We were all adopted. All three of us have V-type blood from a rare DNA mutation. There are only a dozen of us in the entire world. Wait. What happened to our biological parents? Scarlett's parents were both killed in an automobile accident when she was, uh, three. And Emma, you didn't really know your father, but your mother died of leukemia when you were five. What about Kate? I was a princess. Just kidding. I didn't know my parents. They found me in an orphanage with no records. How do you know all this? Besides Bulls eye the historian? It was all on this USB stick. Honey, Mommy needs to borrow Teddy. Can I take him for just a little while? Mm... sure. Thank you. All yours. Mom placed it in a teddy bear that I was holding when she hid me in the tree house. Also on there was their life's work. They were developing a vaccine that would prevent humans from being turned into vampires once bitten. I think I figured it out. Wait, you figured out the cure for vampirism? I'm this close. Mom and Dad would be so proud of you. Thank you. Well, uh... Let's go inside. I'm getting a little chilly out here. Emma, you feel like taking a walk? Sure. Wow. What? Am I dying? Just kidding. Look at this. When I mix your blood with my vaccine, it breaks down the mitochondrial DNA and eliminates the mutation. Once the mutation is eliminated, the resultant cellular plasma becomes unstable, causing massive increase in cellular metabolism of ATP. Oh, Shit, Kate. English, please. Kaboom. It's the vaccine. I'm really sorry I slept with your sister. It's okay. Don't be. It's not the first time. I really like you. I know you didn't want to become a vampire, but, you know, I actually envy you? Envy me? Why? I mean, you're incredibly strong and powerful. Yeah, most guys don't like that. It's kind of hard to find a guy that likes a strong woman, and then you add the whole vampire thing on top of it. Well, I do. I'd like to see you again after this. Really? I mean... there'd have to be some rules... like... you can't feed on me by mistake when we're making out. That's fair. Maybe we should practice. Just to be sure. Oh, hey. So, our little sister's a genius. She not only figured out a vampire vaccine, but a way to use our blood to kill the vampires. Really? How's that possible? Next, I'm going to find a way to turn my sisters back into humans. But first, we need to find a place to hide Kate, because the vampires are coming after her. Yeah, well, let 'em come. I've been looking after Kate here for 12 years. You should see his arsenal. Yeah, well, I'm going outside to check the perimeters. If anybody comes within a mile of here, I'll know about it for sure. So, Kate... I'm fascinated. How did you sequence the MRNA? Did you identify the section of the chromosome where the vampire gene resides? I'm impressed. My mother was actually a bio scientist, if you can believe it. Some kids got video games for Christmas, I got a chemistry set. I'd be honored if you could show me some of your research. I'd be honored to show you. What is it? I know that face. I already know what you're going to say. What? Ugh... Do you think it could work with Marcus and me? He already knows who I am and he still wants to be with me. Oh, my God, Emma. He doesn't like you. He just has a weird vampire fetish. Aside from this whole sleeping with you and me thing, but I think he's like a... he's cute... in, like a... badass kind of way. I don't trust him, Em. Usually, I'm the mistrusting one. I think we both just need to acknowledge that neither one of us is ever going to be normal. I still think we can try to be happy, though. I'm just going to keep my mouth shut. Wouldn't it be crazy if Kate could make us human? Live a normal life? I don't think I know how to be normal again. I'm sure you would adjust. Maybe. We can't lose hope. All these bottles are the vaccine? Yeah. Wow. That is impressive, Kate. Really, your work is astounding. Yeah, and after the human trials, theoretically, I should be able to prevent humans from being turned into vampires ever again. Eradication of vampirism worldwide. Hm. Do you mind if I have a look? Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Are the cells supposed to be fusing like that? What? Let me see. I don't see anything fusing together. Where are they? Oh, what the hell? You girls all right? Yeah. Somebody cut the power manually. I'll just... reboot it. Have you seen Kate or Marcus? Oh, my God, he's got her. Don't say it. Fuck! I'm going to rip that motherfucker apart and feast on him! Well, wherever they're taking her, you can guarantee there's gonna be a lot of vampires there. I know exactly where he's taking her. Thorn's. Well, he's no ordinary vampire. He's the bloodsucker that murdered your parents and turned you two into vampires. Thorn wasn't there. It was vampire assassins that killed our family. And who do you think controls these vampire assassins? What the fuck are you talking about? Thorn wouldn't do that! I have bad news. The masseuse canceled your 3:00 p.m. appointment. That is bad news. Also, it seems the Addisons have created a vaccine to kill vampires. Well, kill them all, and bring me the vaccine. Oh! And kill that masseuse. Oui, monsieur. Wake up! This is exactly what I've been trying to tell you. This is great. Now I have two motherfuckers to kill. No... Thorn's mine. Let's get ready. We're going to war. Well, if you're going to Thorn's, you're gonna need some help. I'm liking this guy more and more. Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Marcus. You son of a bitch. How could you? I do like your sisters, but business is business. He's a trained mercenary, my dear. What do you want, Thorn? Oh, I think you know exactly what I want. You've managed to accomplish something that your parents couldn't. The vaccine. The vaccine will get out no matter what happens to me. But... I have you... - and the vaccine. - Lucky me. Oh, small talk is so boring. Let's go and enjoy our evening, shall we? I've organized a little soiree and I would love you to be my guest. Shall we? Well, you're gonna need these... and silver bullets. Be careful with those. I had to melt down my grandma's entire flatware set to get them. I call shotgun... literally. Really? The shotgun's a good choice. Can we load it with silver? No, but it'll knock 'em down for a few minutes and leave a great, big hole. Ew. Now, these are my pride and joy. They're hand-carved and shaved with a Mora knife. Impressive. You want to see impressive? This, by far, is the Holy Grail of them all. Christ's cross was made from the same tree family. I call the Jesus wood. You guard this with your life. Don't let anything happen to it. You hear me? Ah! Just one more thing. You're gonna like these. In the toe of these boots, there's a blade of solid silver. They belonged to my late wife. She'd do a running spin-kick that would stab these bastards right through the heart. How hot was your wife? Sorry. Watch this. Oh, sick. Those are mine. All right, let's go and kill some vampires. (INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING Ladies and gentlemen... this our guest of honor, Kate. Please. These are some of my oldest friends... and by oldest, I mean four or five centuries old... Give or take a decade. Kate here is a brilliant, young scientist. You see, you seem to think of vampires as some sort of monsters or savages. We are actually the historians of humanity... from the fall of the Roman Empire, to the Russian Revolutions, to your own 9-11... vampires have been there. You are the epitome of evil. Without darkness, there is no light. Without evil, there is no goodness. No. Mankind would do just fine without your kind. Wrong! Without vampires, mankind would have preyed upon itself. We are an important part of its harmony. We have brought balance to the planet for thousands of years while humans over-populated it. Insanity always finds a way to justify itself. And humans always think that they are so righteous. They are not. Bon appétit. Oh, my God. Darling. Going somewhere? This place is horrible. You've got to help me get out of here. Yeah... I felt the same way when I was first turned. The depravity... it's all so barbaric. Listen, you seem different from the others. If you help me, I can help you. Really? How? I can turn you into a human again. Intéressant. Come with me. This like a secret exit or something? Come on in. What is this place? Go ahead, have a seat. Wait, why? Why are you doing this? Because I don't want to be human again. Mm-hm. We've got beaucoup company. FVC. Oh, shit. Poppa Bear. Well, he always knew where we were going to be. Here. Take my truck and get out of here. I'll deal with these clowns. Shotgun. You're driving. Oh, hey, Frank. It's been a while. Bulls eye. I'm going to need to take the vampire sisters in or take them out. Your choice. Kate's been kidnapped. Thorn took her. Now, I think the world of that kid, so I'm going to have to ask you to back off on this one. Thorn's number one on our most wanted list. Sounds like you and the girls have the same agenda. Okay, well, get the girls out here and let's talk about it. Sorry, too late. They've already gone. Let's go, boys. Yeah! Drop in again, Frank. Good luck, girls. Whatever you're trying to do, it's not going to work. I don't know what you need my blood for. It's like cocaine to us. Hello, my love. Is there anyone you haven't slept with? Witty girl. The guests are eager for dessert. My sisters are gonna come for you. Let 'em come. I miss those girls. Bon appétit. Bitch. Enjoy the V blood. From the blood of man and the souls of my immortal ancestors, we drink thy blood. Thank you for your sacrifice. To life everlasting. To life everlasting! Oh! Look at you, clever girl, but sorry, we have to put you back. First get away from me or I'll shank the shit out of you. Did I mention I was there when your family was killed? Ow! You should be grateful we didn't kill you. Ladies! Ladies! Ladies... Let us be civilized. I'm a lover, not a fighter. And we are all family now. You're not my family. You'll never be my family. Give it time. So this is the vaccine that stops humans from being turned? Is that right? Yes. Why wouldn't a human want to be turned into a vampire? What makes life so precious is that it's valuable. Your kind doesn't value anything. You're not living or dead. You're just stuck in purgatory. I feel very much alive. She escapes one more time... you die. Let's split up. You take the basement, I'll take the front entrance. No matter what, we get Kate out. Got it. Emma! Hello, Emma. Hello, Marcus. Oh... What a cute couple. You didn't really think he fell for you, did you? I'll get her sister, you take this one. I'm sorry, Emma. I really did like you. But at the end of the day... I'm just a bloodsucking vampire. Mom! Mom! Mom... Mom! Sorry, kid. I'm just a bloodsucking vampire. Ow! Thorn would accept you back, but I'd rather kill you... Like I did with the rest of your family. Dad! Dad! Dad! Bien mort. Tatiana, you've lived way too long. It's time to die. Fucking love this Jesus wood. Oh! Shit! Truth is... I've had better. I'm not losing you again. Don't worry. I'm not letting you. Let's find Scarlett and get the fuck of out of here. Yeah. Wait. Milly's boot. I've got an idea. I'm gonna put the syringe into your boot. Kate, Emma. Eh... Oh, my God. Are you okay? Yes. No, I'm fine. Hey, I am so sorry. I shouldn't have stayed behind. I should have gone with you. I was just scared. What, you scared? Yes. But I'm not afraid anymore. No, I'm sorry. I mean, you were right. I always fall for those fucking skinny jeans. No, no. You were right. I was just... I was always jealous of you. Why the fuck would you be jealous of me? Mom even said so. That I should always strive to be as good as you. Mom said the exact same thing to me about you. She just said that because she wanted us all to do the best in our lives. She loved us. But for now, us sisters, we stick together. Oh, yeah. Through thick and thin. No matter what. Let's go kill some fucking vampires. We... are gathered here this evening, my friends... ...to... Thorn... we would like to make a peace offering. Thorn was right, when he said humans and vampires must work together. Please... accept my blood as a gift to you all. So, I would love to propose a toast, so that humans and vampires can continue to co-exist. To Thorn! - To Thorn! - To Thorn! So, apparently, you're the reason my parents are dead. I certainly am. But I also gave you and your sister immortality. Well, I give you mortality. Did you really think a little piece of wood like this was going to bother me? You've been watching too many movies, my dear. You know, I'm really going to enjoy watching you die. Now I'm fucking annoyed! Kaboom! Oh, shit. Kaboom! Steve, go left. JB, you're with me. I hope you have a good clean-up crew. Too late. Thorn's already dead. Well done, ladies. You've taken out the world's most-wanted vampire and rescued your kid sister to boot. I think that you girls deserve a pass, but just this once. You know, there's still plenty of other bad vampires out there. How would you girls like to come have a job at the U.S. government? Uh, we're more of the independent type. We'll think about it. Yeah. Don't call us, we'll... we'll call you. Well... seems like... maybe good vampires are a thing. Thanks... Poppa Bear. Well, you're very welcome, Jasmyn with a "Y". You kind of had to be there. Well, go clean up. I don't know what you're waiting for. Shotgun. Shotgun. I said it first. No! I've technically never had shotgun. Yeah, give Kate shotgun. She's been dead for, like 12 years. That's true. Well, I mean, we thought you were dead. Is this how it's going to be? Because you girls are crazy. Whoo! So, who are we going to kill next? Hopefully, no one! Oh, shit! Turn around. We have to go get Bubbles. - Who's Bubbles? - My fish. I left her at the motel. Forget the stupid fish. - Um, that fish is my life. - Dude, that's sad. Forget the stupid fish. - Stop fighting. - Stay out of it. Yeah, seriously, Kate, mind your business. The Addison sisters. A legend begins. - Continues. - Continues? Continues. - Continues. - Think that's better. Uh, say it again. The Addison sisters... Okay, how about all together? - A legend begins. - The Addison sisters. You just said continues! Emma! The Addison sisters! - A legend... - Continues!
