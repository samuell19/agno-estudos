What are you doing swatting flies? I'm just warming up. Warming up? You're sweating already. What was that? Supposed to be a jab? You're getting old, Doc. How's this for getting old? What was that? A love tap? You know, if you could fight as well you could talk, you'd be pretty tough. I just don't want to hurt you. Hurt me? I'm a doctor. Well, I hope you make house calls, because I'm sending you home. You all right? They're going to be moving me any time now. I know Don Vicaro. I'm too a old to go to prison. I know Don Vicaro. I'll probably get the gas chamber this time. Can we have a few minutes alone? It's all taken care of grandfather. We're going to get you out of here. When? When? Tell me when. Right about now. Oh, shit. Vicaro. Come on, move it. Hurry up. What are you doing, man? Nobody gets in. Nobody gets out. Let's go. Come on. Come on. All right, let's go. Let's go Move. Move. Go. Everybody, go. Go. All right, let's get this thing up in the air. Take this down now and get my grandson. No way. It's too dangerous. Now! - I - said, take it down, or I'll blow you're fucking head off. Kill me, you kill us both. If you don't take it down, we both go. Oh, man this is suicide. Take it down. Vito! OK. So first thing is Mrs. Johnson's MRI. Got to get that done tomorrow morning. And then the chest X-ray... Take him to trauma three. Look, we've got four more coming in from drive-by shooting. Handle it. Doctor? Doctor, please? She's in so much pain, can't you do something? We've been here for an hour and a half. I'm sorry. We're understaffed. I'll get a nurse here to administer an IV immediately. Get out of the way. Listen up. Now I don't want no crap. My partner here is messed up. I want him fixed, and I want him fixed now. Excuse me? That's not how it works around here. Now, at any time did you lose consciousness? No, but the other guy did. Well in that case, you're going to have to wait your turn like everybody else. Suppose it is our turn. Look, this is a hospital. We don't want any trouble. I hate doctors. Excuse me. Hi, gentlemen. Sit down. sit down. sit down, come on. sit down. Oh, Mr. Carducci, they're ready for you now. Welcome, mi amicis. I extend to each and every one of you, the comforts of my humble abode and my appreciation for your being here. Gentlemen, tonight we make history. This was the past. And this is the future, our future. Organized crime is on the verge of becoming an international network that will bring together business partners from all over the planet. And tonight, we have the elite de creme de la creme of that... Wu Fong of the Hong Kong triad. The honorable, Soto Waianabashi of the Japanese yakuza, and mi amigo, Carlos Lopez of the Bogota cartel. And last but not least, our esteemed comrade, Vladimir Kruskev, without whose vision and foresight none of this would have been possible. Now, smuggling nuclear weapons from the old Soviet Union and selling them on the black market is a different kind of line than what we're used to. But the profits from this can make us all very, very rich men. Money, I like that. Thanks to our comrade, again, we have what looks to be an unlimited supply of these weapons. And coupled with an overwhelming demand from third world governments, it all spells success, gentlemen. The Carducci family will broker the sales and the buyers will handle their own exploitation. The monies will then be moved again through the same distribution routes for laundering. If we make good on this, and I know we can gentlemen, we're going to be in business for a very long, long time. How do we know we can trust you? You see that kind of thinking is poison to us. We are not the enemy. Not me. Not each other. The feds, the Interpol, they are the enemy. United we conquer, divided we perish. We are the future of the new world order. And together we must rise, and meet these challenges, and become invincible. Veni, vidi, vici. I came, I saw, I conquered. A Salute. OK. You all know what we got to do. We'll meet back here in five minutes. Mike, you and Lance got our backs. Yo, man. I don't know about this robbing the mob shit, man. Yo, man, it's like I told you. We'll be long gone before they even come here. Let's just do what we came to do. It's this way. You guys, follow... What? Somebody broke into the plant. Well go... go take care of it. What's the combo? 10 right. 10 to four. 24 left. 24. And two to the right. Two to the right. In. Oh, my lord. Give me that bag. Oh, yeah. Just hurry up, man. Hurry up. Yeah. Can't leave that. Let's get out of here, man. Break. Oh, real nice plan, man. Now what we going to do? Try not to get killed. Get him! He's running away. ,, don't let him get in. Come on, man. Help me out. Let's go. Come on. Don't let this guy pull away from us. Well, I'm out of here. Johnny, just a quick question. correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't we supposed to be in the patient care business? What are you doing, drumming up business for the clinic? No, if I were, I know a couple of city Councilman I'd be going after. You know, I can't believe they don't think this city needs a volunteer medical facility. You know, speaking of that, we still haven't received the money that was allocated for. And I sure hope it doesn't end up like the school district and the lotto money. What the hell does happen to all that lotto money? Listen, how's Bobby doing? He's fine. He's better. He keeps wondering when he's going to get a new mom. You know, I'd like to spend more time here, but I really feel guilty when I'm away from him for too long. I have an idea. Why don't you both take my cabin up in the mountains for the weekend, because I could sure use a rest. Are you sure? I thought you and nurse Ratchet we're going up there? Johnny, I could use the rest. Get out of here. Thanks. Oh, no! OK. Pull up one. , come on. Let it go. Grab him. Grab him. Come on. Come on. Is he OK? Can I help you? Give me the bag. Give me the bag. Ah, we stole the bag from you. So Get him out of here. Give me the bag. - Bag. Bag. Come on. I was fooling with you, man. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. Hey, pal. Come on, hey! It's OK. - What are his vital signs? He's got the, um... what do you call that? Get out of the way. Look straight ahead. Straight ahead. Get him. Come on, get him. Get him. Oh, I don't believe this. Get in there. The cops, come on! Let's go. This is a gunshot wound. Johnny? I recognized your car. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. What the heck's going on here? I don't know. That's what I was about to ask you. I don't know. I saw the accident. I stopped to help, and somebody pulled a gun on me. Well, did get a good look at him? Yeah, I think I could make him. OK. Let me start getting this mess organized here a little bit, then meet me down at the station, we'll go through mugshots and see what we can find. You sure you're all right? - I'm fine. Give me a minute. - All right. My bag. My bag. What the fuck? Give me the bag. Give me that bag! What's this? What's... What's this? What's this? What's this? Where's the disk? Where's the disk? Where... where's the disk? Where... Where's the disk? Hey. Hey, where's the disk? Where's the money? Where's the... Oh, where's the disk? Where's the disk? Where's the money? Where... Come on. Listen to me. You're coming with me. Somebody's going to want to see you. Take him. Take him. Take him. Take him. Come on, let's get out of here. I don't know what happened, boss. There must have been a switch somewhere. That's a brilliant deduction, Vincent. You figure that out by yourself? Huh? A pack of low-life scumbags break into my place and they steal from me. Is there no respect out there? Who do you think you are, huh? Where's the disk asshole? Disk was in the bag with the money and jewels. Well it's not there now is it? Huh? Is it? Is it? You got a name? Huh? Fingers. Fingers. Fingers. Time to get a new name, huh? Don't kill me. I'll do anything, I swear. Don't kill me. Where's the disk, asshole? It was in the bag with the money. I swear. I swear it was in the bag. You know what, son? I believe you. I believe him. Frickin' doctor has my disk. Get him. Get me back my disk before the friggin FBI, the CIA, the Interpol, and the UN will be up my ass with a bulldozer. Now! - Yes. Yes, boss. Come on, let's go. Come on. Daddy, you need some help? No, I think I got it. Daddy, are we really going fishing? Yeah, we sure are. Going to fish till you turn blue. Yeah, I like blue. Go on in the car. Go on in the car, son. I packed enough food, but you'll have to stop for milk. Thanks, Marla. I should have warned you. He tried getting the camping things ready himself. That's OK. He tried. OK. This is where we'll be. And there's no phone up there, so you have to call me on my cellular. OK. Well don't worry about me. Now you two take off and have a wonderful time. We will. Oh, good. Are you in OK? Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Yes? Uh, is Dr. Wu in? - No. - No. Oh. Well, um, we are interior decorators. And Dr. Wu says that we could come over and look at the place. You know, because we heard it's real nice. So we just like, you know, take a look at his, you know, decorations, and everything, OK? Dr. Wu didn't see anything about that. Oh, well, I'm a doctor, you know, and an interior decorator, also. And, you know, I know Dr. Wu from the hospital. And he says that we could come over here and look at the house. You're a doctor? Yeah, I'm a doctor and an interior decorator. I'd like to see some ID. You want to see some ID? - Yes. - OK. I'll show you some ID. Well, this is it. What do you think? What a great cabin. The subscriber you have called is unavailable. has traveled on site of the coverage... Daddy, daddy come here. Daddy, daddy look. Wow. That's a lot of fish. Look, that's a big one. I'm going to catch the biggest fish in the whole lake. Hello? Yeah, get me on with Mr. Carducci. Oh, hold on a second. Yeah? Oh, uh, Mr. Carducci, it's me, Vinn. Yeah, what do you want? Listen. You know, Wu's not home right now, but I know where he is. He's up in some cabin, up in some mountain, or something. What do you want me to do? You do what you gotta do. You just make sure I get that disk back. All right. Yeah. OK. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Get in. Look at that, Bobby. Roar. Come on. Watch your head. That must be a real cougar. Hey there. Hi. Is that your pet cat? No, it's a Sheba. She's a cougar. Wow. I rescued her from a poacher's trap this morning. She's a beauty. You must be the park ranger. Yeah. The only one on the mountain. I'm Kelly Scarborough. Johnny Wu, nice to meet you. This is my son, Bobby. Hi Bobby. Hi. So what brings you two to Winslow? We're just coming to pick up some groceries for dinner. Will you come eat with us? Oh, I'm sure your mommy and daddy want to be alone. My mom is in heaven. I'm sorry. If you'll excuse me. Just don't get too close to the cat, OK? Pretty nice cougar, huh? Sure is. Come on. Howdy. Nice day, isn't it? It sure is. - I'm Sheriff Watkins. - I'm Johnny Wu. This is my son, Bobby. Are you all passing through? No, we're going fishing up at the lake. Oh, that lake's got the best tasting trout I ever had. you know, a little butter and a little lemon, and you got yourself a meal you won't find anywhere. but you be on the lookout for the big one up there. The locals here call him Jaws. You know he must be 36 inches long and would weigh at least 15 pounds. Y'all have fun now. Sure will. This you truck? Well what do we have here? Why, Clem, we got us a genuine female ranger. Only thing I like better than a woman in uniform is a woman in uniform coming in for a drink. Now come one, don't be like that. Come on inside. Come on in... Up against the truck, fat head. Sit here, Bobby. I'll be right back. All right. I am shutting you guys down. I am confiscating your truck, your traps, everything else. Shit. What's the problem? These poachers seem to have a problem with the law. Let's get them. All right. Well, thank you. You know you still haven't answered Bobbie's question about dinner. So are you inviting me now? Yeah. I'd love to. How about, um, 8 o'clock, up on Chowder hill. Doc's place? Yeah. That'd be great. Great. OK. I'll see you then. OK. Oh. Whoa. Bobby. Let's go, Bobby. Do you think Jaws is out there? I'm not afraid. I've got you to protect me. That's right. You sure do. Oh, you got a big one. Pull him in. That's it. Reel him in. Oh, no. oh, maybe next time. OK. OK, Bobby, put away your toys, help me set the table. Uh-oh. What's the matter? You don't like my cooking? No way. She's here. She sure is. Hi. Hi. Come on in. Thanks. Where is Bobby? There he is. Hey there camper. How are you doing? Look what I got for you? What do you say? Thank you. You're welcome. Come on. Come on. Are you sure it's over there? - Yeah, boss. - OK. Let's do it. I like her, daddy. Me too. Give me a kiss. Good night. He is so sweet. I hope you don't mind me asking, but what happened to Bobby's mother? Julie was killed in a car accident... drunk driver. I'm sorry. So, what about you? Never been married? No. You live up here all alone? Yeah. Must be nice. Yeah, it is nice. It's plenty of fresh air, no phones. It's beautiful. I'd say mother nature did a pretty good job. I think so too. I could get used to living up here. I don't know about that. What do you mean? You'd miss the excitement of the city. It gets pretty boring up here. You did pretty well with those poacher's. Where'd you learn to fight like that? The army. The army? Yeah. Well, hey, you've handled yourself pretty well too, for a doctor. So what made you decide to get out? I was stationed in Iraq during the war, and we were supposed to get lines down on a nuclear plant that Hussein was building. We found the plant, but they were protecting it with children, like live bait for anybody with a weapon. It made me sick. War, killing, politics... none of it made any sense. I guess you could say a spiritual revelation came over me. As soon as I got back, I put in for discharge, and this place is as far away as I could get. I love it up here, though. And I know it sounds sort of crazy, but I feel like I'm closer to heaven up here. Doesn't sound crazy to me. Thanks. I had a wonderful time. Me too. Dinner was great. Thank you. Well, maybe tomorrow morning you can show Bobby and me around the lake. Oh, yeah. I'd love to. That'd be great. Well, um I guess, I should go. I'll walk you to your car. OK. Yes! Come on. Let's go. All right, come on. You know what to do. Let's go. Come on. Let's let them know we're here. Hey, daddy, help. All right, come out the bag, Wu. We know you got it. Come on. Hey, Wu, look. All we want is the disk, OK? So just give me the disk, OK? That's it. All right, Wu. Bobby, stay here. Don't move. You'll be safe. OK? OK. You want to play? Huh, Wu? You want to play? OK. I'll play with you. OK, Wu? Everybody, go. OK. OK. Come on. Let's load the place up. Freeze! Put the guns down. Drop them! Bobby, it's all right, son. Come on out. Bobby, come out. Bobby! Daddy. Thank god. You sure know how to throw a dinner party, huh? So who are they? I don't know, but I'm going to find out. I'm scared, daddy. Stay right here, Bobby. I don't get it. MAC-11s, C-4, all that manpower... Whoever they are, this is what they want. What's on it? I don't know. My bag was switched at an accident. Let's just get to the Sheriff's. My truck's over here, come on. Oh, great. Oh, man. They smashed the radio. I hope you're up for a walk. How far? A good six miles. No way. Is there any place closer? Yeah, there is. Follow me. Hello, Mr. Carducci, it's me, Vinny. I know who it is, stupid. It wasn't good, boss. We got to the cabin and shot it up like you said, but then we got jumped by ninjas or something. There must have been 20 of them. Karate kung fu fucks all over the place. And the doctor was on of them. I tried to cap him, but he got away. I didn't get no disk. I'm real sorry, Mr. Carducci. All right. Well, get your skinny ass back here. You have problems, comrade? No. No problems, just solutions. You are beginning to irritate me. You tried to hide something from me, no? distrust... it goes both ways. Comrade, we must see eye to eye. This doctor got a hold of something that belonged to me. I sent my boys up to the mountain to get it back. One thing and another, and the bastard took them out. Most of them, anyway. Except for that yo-yo for brains, Vinnie. On my mother's grave, what did I do to deserve him? What did this doctor take that was so important? The computer disk. The disk with our charts and everything? Yeah, yea. But I'm telling you I'll handle it. He doesn't even know what he's got. This is not good my friend. I told you, I'll handle it. No. You will let me find him for you. What? What do you want to let psycho off the leash? My friend, do not be impertinent. It is as important for me, as it is for you that our operations run smoothly. Besides, I have as much to lose as you do, comrade. Hey look, you want to let your boys be in on the party? Go ahead. Be my guest. Sitjkoff, he just likes to kill Americans, reminds him of old days in KGB. And besides, the doctor will see his last patient. Careful. Bronk? Hey, Bronk? I don't know where he is. Well, look who's here. Kelly, it's good to see you. You've got some friends with you, huh? This is Johnny and his son, Bobby. Guys, the one and only, Bronk Calhoun. I like your animals. Oh, thank you very much. Bronk, we ran into some trouble. I really need your help. You know, I heard a lot of noise coming from the lake last night. Now, that had nothing to do with you all, did it? Afraid so. I need you to watch Bobby, here, until we get back with Sheriff Watkins. Yeah, anything I can do to oblige. Hop on this old horse here. We'll look around this ranch, here. You want to? OK. Hang onto this old horsey. Oh, goodness. Who is this guy? He's an old friend. Here the goats. Are you sure Bobby is going to be safe here? Bronk's the greatest. He'll be fine. Bobby, come here. Now, you stay here and be good. OK? I'll be back as soon as I can. I love you. I love you too. Have fun. Let's go. You all be careful. Stop. Bear trap. It breaks the bone and severs the artery so that the animal bleeds to death. They're well hidden, so be sharp. Dasvidaniya. Idiot. That Mr. Carducci don't want him dead yet. Get the disk, then fry him. He could have hid it somewheres. Where did it come from? Did you seen anything? I don't know. This way. Stay low. Move your butts. We're doing this. Off with their heads. Don't try nothing stupid. What kind of doctor are you? This is man who defeated your soldiers? and ninjas. How should I know? Where's the disk? What disk? What disk? You are a no fighter. Try me. Maybe. Maybe I will. Ah, enough of this shit. I got it from here, Boris. My name is not Boris. Where's the disk, asshole? Hey look, I'm not in a conversant mood. Hand it over if you know what's good for you. Don't try anything, or I'll kill you. Go to hell. Wait. Leave him alone. You had very pretty face. All right. All right. I'll tell you where it is. Where? Over there. Check it out. You better not be lying. Grab him! Get a hold of him! Come on. Get them. They're getting away. Vlad, hurry. Get after them. You OK? Yeah. Close call, huh? Nine against two. Sounds like even odds to me. I like your style, Doc. Let's split up. OK. Be back in 10. Hold. Hold. Hold. Wait. Wait. I'm getting too old for this shit. Look, I say we split up and surround them. You go that way. OK, guys, this way. Hey. Tony? Tony? Come in. Tony? Here. Tony? Come on, Tony? Come in, Tony. Tony? Hey, Vinnie, behind you. Tony, where are you? Come in, Tony. I ain't going through this shit again. Bang. Behind you. You're next. Let's get out of here. Come on. Hey, Boris! No. No. Don't shoot. They just whacked all of my men. They got a radio. Do you want him alive? Then listen to me, and maybe you'll live. Johnny Wu? Come in, Johnny Wu? We just want the disk. you give it to us, and you go free. Yeah, like your visit last night? There's only two ways out of this forest. Either you walk out now, or you leave in a body bag. Da. Da. I accept your challenge. Come on. Oh, I don't like this, Boris. I don't like that one bit. I mean, we just got here and look what happened. And now you want to play commando raid with this quack. I mean, this ain't no Suicide Squad over here. You know what I'm saying? I told you not to call me Boris. Now you call me Boris one more time and I will bite out your tongue and feed it to the wolves. And then, I will kill you. Oh, Jesus. Come on. Grenade. Grenade! Run! Ah. Oh, man, we're not getting out of here alive. Oh, man, why can't you speak American for once, huh? Fuck you. Let's circle back, get behind them. Good idea. I'll go this way. Don't move. Don't move. Where is the disk? Where is the disk? No. No! I'll get you, Johnny Wu! You're a lunatic. You know that? You're trying to get me killed down here. You're a son of a bitch who should be locked up. Hey, Boris? You hear me? You hear me? Hear me? I told you not to call me Boris. He was supposed to call an hour ago. You must relax, comrade. Sitjkoff is a very efficient soldier. He never fails mission, unlike your men. Hey, I don't care what you think. You know, you're starting to get on my nerves. You're still in the good old US of A. You are a dirty dick. What did you say? I said, you are the boss, comrade. Help me. Sheriff. Johnny. Kelly. Oh, god, Sheriff. He's been shot. Let me see. let me see. OK. Come on. Come on. Over here, Sheriff. Sit down. Sit down. Let me take a look. Let me take a look. Johnny Wu, I've got your son. Daddy. If you want to see your son alive, be at the Carducci Cemetery Factory in four hours. In four hours! Bobby! I'm Ok. Save the boy. Take my truck. Be careful, Johnny. How can one guy do all that, huh? Some doctor. How do I know Godzilla, here, didn't go psycho and whack everybody? Trust, comrade. Hey, and I'm not your fucking comrade. I trust you about as far as I can spit. And I don't trust this monkey either. 14 men. What do I gotta do, call out the friggin' militia? come here. That is a very loud, smelly man, no? Do you miss your Papa? Yeah. You a good boy. Yes you are. How about we go get your papa? Huh? Yeah? You want me to do that for you? Good. All right, let's see what we got here. Well, well, you son of a bitch. Johnny, you'd better take a look at this. What is it? It's an international distribution flowchart for weapons sales. Nuclear weapons bought and sold on the black market. That name mean anything to you? No. Well, it does to me. That's mafia. It's the worst. You really got yourself into a hell of a pickle here, my friend. Since the fall of communism, the Russian mob has gone crazy. The black market controls a major percentage of the country's export. You stumbled onto an international conspiracy. Criminals with nuclear weapons? I mean, that's crazy. I mean, what would happen if... If just one of them gets a wild hair up his ass... just when we thought the nuclear threat was over. Resurfaced under another name. Organized crime... global mafia. What are we going to do about Bobby, Mike? I mean, they said... They said, no cops. John, Carducci is going to kill Bobby, anyway. But he's going to wait until you're there. We've got less than two hours. Listen, Carducci's got ears all over the place, even in the department. Bobby's only way out of this alive is us. Over here, doc. Bobby. Happy father's day. It's very touching. You? You're the psycho that took out half of my crew? Come on. Let's have it. The disk, doc. Sit down, Bobby. Here. Stay here, Bobby. I'll be right back. Now, I think I try you. Daddy, why do people hurt other people? I don't know, son. that's a tough one. Why do fish eat worms. That's easy. They like the way they taste. They don't taste. You could have tried. You better stick to people food, son. Hey, I made some worm soup for lunch. Ewww. Have a seat. Doctors orders? Absolutely. Bobby, you got one. Great.
