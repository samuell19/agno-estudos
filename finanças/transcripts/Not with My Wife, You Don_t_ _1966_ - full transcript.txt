WHAT COULD HAPPEN? KEEP THE MOTOR RUNNING. I CAN BEST ILLUSTRATE THE TACTICAL USE OF THIS THING BY REFERRING TO SEVERAL INCIDENTS IN THE KOREAN CAMPAIGN. WE FOUND OUT THAT OUR FORMATIONS WERE UNWIELDY. THEY WERE INFLEXIBLE, AND SO WE DEVELOPED THE &quot;HUNT AND KILL&quot; CONCEPT. THE TIME--SEPTEMBER 1952. THE PLACE--MIG ALLEY. Echo: MIG ALLY.

NEXT TIME, TELL OLD SMILING JACK OVER THERE &quot;A LITTLE MORE SUBTLE.&quot; NOW, WHERE WERE WE? OH, YEAH. SHALL WE? YOU WERE TERRIBLY RUDE. I'M NOT HERE TO GIVE OUT INTERVIEWS. I'M A FLIER. AREN'T YOU A SECRET AGENT? RIGHT. HOW COULD MY PICTURE BE ON THE COVER OF TIME? WE'D BETTER GO. THERE ARE SO FEW HOURS TILL DAWN. HEY, CHARLIE, THE C.O.'s LOOKING FOR McVEY, CORRESPONDENT FROM TIME MAGAZINE. YOU SEEN HIM? OH, YEAH. HE JUST WENT OUT. THANKS. YOU MEAN HE REALLY WAS-- UH, SIT DOWN, THERE, HONEY. DON'T GO AWAY. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. UH, EXCUSE ME, MA'AM. I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR CAPTAIN MARTIN. A PATHETIC CASE. MAY I SIT DOWN? HE DIDN'T GIVE YOU THAT &quot;SECRET AGENT, &quot;SO FEW HOURS TILL DAWN, LIPS HUNGER TO FUSE&quot; ROUTINE, DID HE? HOW DID YOU KNOW? IT ALL CAME OUT IN THE TRIAL. TRIAL? MMM. TERRIBLY SORDID. THEY HUSHED IT UP BECAUSE OF HIS WAR RECORD. MY BLOOD RUNS COLD AT THE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE DID TO THAT SWEET, INNOCENT, DEFENSELESS NURSE. WHAT DID HE DO? MAY I ASK YOUR AGE? 19. YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO READ THE NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS. I HAVE THEM OVER AT MY PLACE. HE DIDN'T YES, YES. TRY TO-- YOU MEAN HE-- OH, IT'S A LONG STORY. I BETTER GET US A FIFTH OF BOURBON. UH, CHARL... [LAUGHTER] WE BETTER HURRY, HONEY. YEAH. THANK YOU, CHARLIE. COME ON. SPIT ON THE AMERICAN FLAG, WILL YOU? THAT'S LIKE SPITTING ON VALLEY FORGE OR BETSY ROSS... MY MOM'S APPLE PIE! YEAH... SORRY, OLD MAN. [SHOUTING] TOM! HELP! Tank: HELP! HE'S SPITTING ON THE FLAG! OK, WE'LL GET IT DRY-CLEANED! LET'S STAY AND WATCH THIS, OK? HE NEEDS HELP! HELP? HE'S EATING THEM ALIVE.

WHY DID YOU SPIT ON THE AUSTRALIAN FLAG? NO, NO, WAIT. IT'S NOT TRUE! THEY'RE KILLING HIM! IT WILL TAKE HOURS. Julie: YOU'LL BE A LITTLE WEAK FOR A FEW DAYS, AND THE HEADACHES WILL BE VERY BAD. FINITO. ALL DONE. HI. HI. WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE WARNED ME. YOU'RE TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR SOMEONE TO JUST OPEN HIS EYES AND SEE. LIEUTENANT.

IT'S NOT ALLOWED? OH, I'M NOT COMPLAINING. IT'S JUST I NEVER THINK OF BRUNETTES AS BLONDES-- I MEAN ITALIANS. IT'S USUALLY MORE ONE WAY THAN THE OTHER. I MEAN, WHATEVER THE OTHER WAY WAS, I LIKE IT BETTER YOUR WAY. DO YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT? NO, I DON'T FEEL WELL AT ALL. I'M GOING TO NEED A LOT OF ATTENTION, YES. YOU'LL HAVE TO BE HERE ALL THE TIME. HA HA! TELL ME. HOW DID IT HAPPEN? OH, IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS. 6 MIGS JUMP ME. I BLAST 3 OF THEM, BUT ONE OF 'EM GETS ON MY TAIL. BAM! MY ENGINE'S ON FIRE, THE AMMO'S EXPLODING, AND SHE'S BUCKING LIKE A BRONCO. I GET 2 OF 'EM AS I GO INTO THIS STEEP SUICIDE DIVE. I SHOULD HIT THE SILK, BUT I'M FLYING $1 MILLION WORTH OF TAXPAYERS' AIRPLANE. DON'T ASK ME HOW, BUT I PULL HER OUT AT 50 FEET. I SLAM HER DOWN ON A RUNWAY. I SKID ABOUT 1 1/2 MILES INTO A RICE PADDY TO AVOID HITTING THIS CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE-- THIS TINY CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE. YOUR CHART SAYS &quot;CONCUSSION DUE TO BRAWL IN SERVICE CLUB.&quot; OH, YOU MEAN THAT BRAWL. OH, WELL, THAT CAME LATER. NO ONE CAN SPIT ON THE AMERICAN FLAG WHILE TOM FERRIS IS AROUND. THAT WOULD BE VERY BAD ON YOUR RECORD. IT WAS JUST A FIGHT. IT RELIEVES THE TENSION OF FIGHTING ALL THE TIME. HAVE YOU HEARD FROM A CAPTAIN MARTIN? OH, YES. OH, YOU HAVE, HUH? HE CALLED TWICE. HE'S VERY WORRIED ABOUT YOU. HE DAMN WELL SHOULD BE. YOU MUSTN'T SEE HIM. I MEAN, I MUSTN'T SEE HIM. HE'S AN UNSTABLE CHARACTER, AND HE MAKES ME NERVOUS, AND I'M A VERY CALM PERSON.

DOCTOR'S ORDERS. HE MUST HAVE COMPLETE ISOLATION. Tank: WHO'S IN CHARGE OVER THERE? SWITCH ME OVER TO COLONEL HOCKSTADER. NURSE, I LEFT EXPRESS INSTRUCTIONS THERE WERE TO BE NO PHONE CALLS HERE.

I HAD NO IDEA, MAJOR. THE PATIENT MUST HAVE NO DISTRACTIONS AND NO EXCITEMENT. THAT MEANS NO PHONE CALLS, NO VISITORS, NOTHING. DO YOU READ ME? WELL, I SURE HOPE HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. OH, HE'S GOING TO BE FINE IF PEOPLE JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE. HE'S IN MIGHTY FINE HANDS. GOOD-BYE. BEAUTIFUL HANDS. MMM. HE CAN'T BE THAT MUCH OF A MONSTER. HE CAN'T, HUH? WHY DOES HE SLEEP IN A COFFIN? OH, STOP. WHEN HE ORDERS A BLOODY MARY, IT'S THE REAL THING. WHY DOES HE DISTURB YOU SO MUCH? HE DOESN'T DISTURB ME. YOU WANT TO KNOW MY PROBLEM? YOU. LIEUTENANT. EVERY TIME YOU WALK INTO THIS ROOM, BUTTERFLIES... A WHOLE SQUADRON. I...I'LL GET YOUR DINNER. WHO CAN EAT? I CAN'T. YOU-- DON'T. PLEASE. UH, EXCUSE ME. LIEUTENANT FERRIS? SORRY, SIR. NO VISITORS. IT'S BEEN 10 DAYS. DOCTOR'S ORDERS. HE'S IMMOBILIZED-- MUST HAVE COMPLETE REST. Man: MARY. MARY. STOP. HONEY, I THINK I'M GETTING THAT FEVER BACK AGAIN. CHARLIE, NOT HERE. UH, I'LL TAKE THE FLOWERS, SIR. I THINK MAYBE I'LL GET HIM SOMETHING A LITTLE SHOWIER. LIEUTENANT FERRIS, PLEASE. LIEUTENANT, WATCH IT. CAPTAIN MARTIN IS SNEAKING UP TO YOUR ROOM. DON'T MENTION IT, SIR. TOM? HMM? SOMEONE HERE? IT'S ME--TANK. TANK. TANK! WHERE ARE YOU? COME CLOSER. CAN'T YOU SEE ME? NO, BUT I CAN HEAR YOU. YOU'RE RIGHT OVER THERE, HUH? OH, TOMMY. TANK? OH, TANK. IT'S SO GOOD TO TOUCH SOMEONE, BUT YOU CAN'T STAY. I'M NOT ALLOWED VISITORS OR PEOPLE. I'M JUST SICK ABOUT THIS. IT'S NOT PERMANENT, IS IT? NO, NO, NO. IT'S PRESSURE ON THE OPTIC NERVE. DOCTOR SAYS A FEW MORE WEEKS, AND I'LL BE FINE. NICE SEEING YOU, TANK. YOU HAVE TO GO, TANK. WELL... GIVE THEM HELL, BUDDY. RIGHT. TANK, THE FLOWERS. HUH? I SMELLED THEM THE MINUTE YOU CAME IN. RHODODENDRONS-- MY FAVORITE FLOWER. OH, THANKS, TANK. OH, SO BEAUTIFUL. THEY REALLY BRIGHTEN UP THE ROOM. MARVELOUS COLORS, I IMAGINE. [SNIFF] WHAT A FRAGRANCE. [SNIFF] MMM. OH, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. OH, GORGEOUS. MMM, BEAUTIFUL. [SNIFF] MARVELOUS. HELLO THERE. HI, SIR. HOW'S OLD TOM? THEY SAY HE'S GETTING ALONG JUST FINE. IN FACT, I GOT TO BRING HIM SOME STUFF UP TO THE HOSPITAL-- HIS ROBE AND SOME BOOKS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. WHAT'S IN THE BAG? OH, FRUIT. I'D LIKE TO BE THERE WHEN HE PEELS IT. HOWDY! HEY, HEY! YOU CAN SEE. YEAH. WELL, IT COMES AND GOES. GILROY GOT A LITTLE HUNG UP. HE SAID YOU BOUGHT THIS FOR A NURSE. YES--NURSE KREMDEL. NICE OLD BAG. SHE'S HAVING A 50th BIRTHDAY, AND SO I BOUGHT HER A LITTLE PRESENT. WELL, WHAT IS IT? WELL, IT'S A PAISLEY SHAWL AND SOME NICE, LONG, WOOLEN UNDERWEAR. TOMMY, YOU'RE ALL HEART. OH! OH. YOU'RE BEGINNING TO FADE AGAIN. YOU'D BETTER GO. I'LL GET YOUR NURSE. I DON'T WANT MY NURSE. I'D BETTER GET YOU SOME HELP. NURSE! NO! NO! TANK! THERE'S A SICK MAN IN HERE! WHAT'S WRONG? Tom: I WANT MY NURSE-- THE OTHER ONE-- OTHER ONE? MISS NIBLUM. HE MEANS MISS KREMDEL. I'D BETTER GET BACK TO MY ROOM. I THINK YOU HAVE A FEVER. IT'S HIM. HIM. HE... [TOM MUMBLES] ARE YOU CAPTAIN MARTIN? TOM BOUGHT YOU THIS LITTLE PRESENT. I JUST THOUGHT I'D DROP IT OFF. OH. YOU'RE VERY KIND. AT YOUR SERVICE. WE'RE OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY. HA HA HA! WELL, YOU'RE VERY KIND. OH, YES. GRAZIE. PREGO! [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. NURSE, MY TEMPERATURE. YOU BETTER LEAVE. THIS IS NOT A HOTEL. IT'S A HOSPITAL. CAPTAIN, I THINK PERHAPS... AH, RIGHT. I FORGOT ABOUT HIS INTERSTITIAL CONTUSIONS WITH HIS INTERMITTENT DOUBLE-TALK. WELL, TOM, OLD BOY, MUSTN'T KEEP THE BIG WAR WAITING, HUH? OOH! OH. BYE. WHY, YOU SNEAKY, SLIMY, CREEPY BUM. I THINK HE'S CHARMING. SNEAK IN WHILE MY LIFE IS DANGLING BY A THREAD. OH, I HOPE YOU LIKE THIS. TOM, I TOLD YOU-- NO MORE PRESENTS, PLEASE. PLEASE. IT'S A LITTLE TOKEN OF MY ESTEEM. OH. HUH? OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT WAS MY MOTHER'S. OH, TOM, YOU ARE CRAZY. JULIE, I... I AM SORRY. I'M ON DUTY NOW. Tom: JULIE? YES? YOU KNOW SOMETHING? I REALLY DO. DO? LOVE YOU. MAY I? WHY DO I HAVE THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION THAT I HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A LITTLE CHARACTER ASSASSINATION? THERE'S BEEN SOME TARGET PRACTICE. WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS SAID, BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE FAIRER SEX, MY BEHAVIOR HAS ALWAYS BEEN RESPECTFUL, CONSIDERATE, AND TOTALLY LECHEROUS. MAY I ASK, CAPTAIN, WITH EVERYBODY MAKING LOVE, WHO'S FIGHTING THE WAR? LET'S NOT TALK SHOP. OR BETTER STILL, LET'S-- OVER A CIVILIZED DINNER AT A CHARMING PLACE I HAVE MANAGED TO UNCOVER. WHICH DO YOU PREFER-- I'M WASHING MY HAIR, OR I HAVE ANOTHER DATE? PICK YOU UP AT 6:00? WHY DO YOU HAVE SO LITTLE CONFIDENCE? IT ALL STEMS FROM A RATHER PRAGMATIC FEELING THAT LEMON DROP SOUP, SCAMPI CLOAKED IN THE SHEEREST BATTER, AND A FAIRLY PALATABLE ESPRESSO-- EVEN WITH ME-- IS PREFERABLE TO A PLATE OF HASH AT THE NURSES' MESS. THANK YOU, CAPTAIN. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] YOU DO SPEAK ITALIAN. WELL, JUST ENOUGH TO GET MY FACE SLAPPED. WHEN IS TOM DUE TO BE RELEASED? THE DOCTOR SAID SOMETHING ABOUT WEDNESDAY. WEDNESDAY. HMM. ANOTHER BRANDY? NO, THANK YOU. YOU KNOW OLD TOM'S HAD 58 MISSIONS? I'D SAY HIS NERVES ARE DESPERATELY IN NEED OF A RETUNING. HE SEEMS FINE TO ME. WELL, PERHAPS, BUT AS HIS FLIGHT COMMANDER, I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO RECOMMEND A SOLID MONTH IN JAPAN AWAY FROM ANY UNDUE STIMULATION, AND I'M AFRAID, LIEUTENANT, THAT INCLUDES YOU. I THINK THAT'S FOR A DOCTOR TO DECIDE. EXACTLY. HI THERE. FAN MAIL? FROM TOM IN TOKYO. NICE WORK, CAPTAIN. WELL, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? APOLOGIZE FOR SAVING HIS LIFE? YOU GOT ANY IDEA WHAT 58 COMBAT MISSIONS CAN DO TO A MAN-- THE STRAIN OF FLYING ON NOTHING BUT RAW NERVE? WE CLOSE WITH THE ENEMY ABOUT 500 MILES AN HOUR. YOU'RE EITHER RAZOR-SHARP, OR THEY PICK YOU UP WITH A BLOTTER. THAT WON'T HAPPEN TO TOM, NO, SIR, EVEN IF I HAVE TO KEEP HIM IN JAPAN FOR 6 MONTHS. UH... BY THE WAY, I GOT A COUPLE OF INVITES TO THE V.I.P. SECTION OF THE USO TONIGHT. I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU, BUT PERHAPS YOU'D RATHER GO WITH SOMEBODY YOU DON'T FIND QUITE SO DISTASTEFUL.
