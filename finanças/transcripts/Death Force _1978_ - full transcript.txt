Ah, we're halfway home. Yeah, man. Get ourselves off this plane and have a little lightweight celebration! You know? You're the only one I know who'd celebrate waking up in the morning. We're not throwing any parties till we're back in LA. Hey, man. It's a half a million people leaving this city. They wouldn't notice us if we stood up and shot off flares. He's right, Morelli. Ain't nobody gonna be checking every box coming out of here. And even if they did, you can better believe we wouldn't be the only ones with something to hide. Hey, I got too much to hide, man. I'mma have a big ol' Rolls-Royce. Nice fine car when I want to take a ride and pretty ladies. You'd better believe it. McGee's got 'em right by his side. Well, what about the future, big time? You know, coke is gone for $100 a gram in LA, and smack is half that much. I'm going into a nice big, fat volume business. The only thing I want to get my hands on when I get back is my wife. Hey, you know the best thing about getting out of this war is I don't have to listen to you talking about your wife no more. You're just jealous 'cause you saw her first. You shouldn't have let her get away. Yep. Shouldn't have turned my back. You know, pretty soon you're gonna have your fill of that broad. Then what? Hm. Oh, I thought I'd go into real estate. Maybe you can turn Watts into Beverly Hills. Plane that came in from Nam today with the coffins, are they here yet? - Yeah, yeah. - You sure? Yeah, yeah. They were delivered immediately. - OK. Thanks a lot. So I didn't want to be too conspicuous, see. So I leaned over about 10 bar stools, add I said, say, miss lady, are you free tonight? She said, no, but I'm reasonable. If you guys tell me you're gonna be some place, stay put. You know how many bars there are in this town? It's our duty as Americans-- Can you sober up enough to do a little work? Work? I thought we were rich. You ain't rich yet. This is Moneda, Galvin, Ortiz. McGee, Russell. Not quite what I expected. Pretty faces, ladies, you know. Get some chairs. Hey, excuse me, fellas. Y'all know the lady that works right over here? At the canteen right over here. Yes, th-- that lady, the pretty one, the fine out. 'Cause if you know her, I will give you some money to introduce me. 'Cause I think I love-- I mean, I saw her the other-- Tony. Come on. So I said, are you free tonight? And she said, no, but I'm reasonable, I'm reasonable. So I said, well, I got $10. She said, shit, well, $10 wouldn't keep me in Seoul. We take it out to the Chinaman's boat tomorrow at 10:00. I'm gonna be in no shape to be getting up at 10:00 in the morning. For the type of money we're getting-- I'll get up. Say, uh, you invite dinner guests? What the hell do they want? I thought you were supposed to get out as soon as you got paid. We thought we were stealing a body. And? That was not a body in the coffin. I see you made a killing in Vietnam. We talked about the price. I agree. No need to count. It's all there. It's been a pleasure, Chinaman. You're gonna live like a king for a while, then you're going to be on your ass again. You know how I wound up in Nam? 'Cause it was safe. The VCs were bad. But compared to what was after me in the States-- I made a promise. If I live through this, I'm going back, and I'm gonna put some people out of business. That's supposed to make you rich? Man, we've been fighting all our lives, in the streets, in the jungles. With what we know now, the two of us could go back there and-- I thought we were three? That man's going home to a wife and a kid. He ain't ready for what we're getting into. You could be going home to that lady. He could be just another war casualty. You asking me to kill one of my own kind? Oh, don't give me that brother shit. The only brother is the man on the dollar bill, and he ain't black. Just think about it. Hey, what it is? Seems like we could have just gone back to Manila. Hey, man, what if somebody tells the Chinaman we're heading back to Manila with half a million-- Maria? 20 minutes till your next show. Thanks, kid. What's wrong? His last letter said he'd be home. Said he only had one more thing he had to do. How long ago was that? 41 days, 20 hours exactly. You really love him, don't you? Love? Trina, he's my life. And of course, little Jimmy. I can't wait to see Doug's face the first time he sees his own son. America. This man is alive. He won't last long. Fool! For years you complain about having to catch the fish, cleaning the camp, carry water. Here is a man who can help us. He doesn't look like much help. Pick him up. This is not a task for a man of my years. Julie. It's been a long time. Get out of here before you get killed. It's a friendly visit, Julie. You got a nice place here. It's real respectable. Yeah, well, I'm a business man. Well, now, just how much of this stuff out here came off hijacks? Listen, I'm not gonna deal with a couple of punks. Julie, you keep that up, you ain't gonna be dealing with anybody. Don't make threats you can't back up. Oh, you've never seen us work. Yeah, man. I saw a lot of guys' work in my time, and I'm still around. We work different, Julie. Much different. Get your ass out of here before Russo hears about it. Goddammit! That's a tough break, Julie. You insured? Shit, man, why'd you have to wipe me out? Ha. Different people work different ways. We warned you, Julie. Russo's gonna hear about it. Russo's got problems of his own. If he die, do I get bed back? He will not die. Uh, 200. Let's make it interesting. I up it 1,000. Another bluff, Russo. Try me. You guys haven't got any goddamn balls. How do you like this for a bluff? No guts, no glory. Russo! Guess what? You're dead. Half-dead man wash up on beach. Why can't case of wine wash up? Why can't barrel of rice wash up? Why don't you be quiet? Why don't I be quiet? Why I always have to cook the fish? Because I am the officer. If anyone knew we are still alive, I would be general by now. I've been 37 years in army. If you are a general, I will be emperor, and you would still be cooking the fish. Do I cook for him now? Hm! You damn motherhumpers. What'd he say? Sound like English, but, uh, not English I hear before. At the bar. Good morning. May I help you? Yeah. How much you paying Russo for your deliveries? Why? Are you a cop or something? We're handling your account from now on. Well, you talk to Russo. Read about it in the morning papers on the obituary page. He had a little accident. Well, I can't. Who the hell are you guys? Who are you? Soldiers of Japanese Imperial Army. What year is this? We are not exactly certain. Uh, 1970-something. Uh, we-- we lost count 1951 or 1961. What happened to the boat? We found you on the beach. You were, uh, carried ashore by the tide. You brought me here? You were wounded. Uh, your throat-- ck! Those motherhumpers. You said that in your sleep. What does that mean? N-- nothing. Some friends of mine. Ah. They do that to you? They no friends. We your friends. We motherhumper. It's been a long time. Do you know where Doug is? Yeah. He, uh-- he won't be coming back. I had wanted to be the one to tell you. Jimmy. We were almost home, and then there was this accident. Well, is there anything I can do? Well, how are you fixed for bread? I mean, with me, money is no problem. Please go away. Please. Yeah. Well, I'll be back. I'll be back to see how you're doing. Hi-yah! The samurai has a code. Loyalty until death. Pride in one's name and one's honor. Total and unconditional obedience to one's shogun. Seppuku if one fails. It is Japanese tradition since 12th century. One should not show disloyalty to one's emperor. But your emperor surrendered 30 years ago. American propaganda. So you're just gonna spend the rest of your life out here on this island, huh? There is food. There is sunshine. I read. The Americans left books, newspaper. And I, I study my art-- the art of the samurai. For 800 years, the samurai have been soldiers of the emperor. I've seen your emperor on TV. All he ever does is cut a ribbon when they open up a bridge. I have sworn to cherish his honor more than my life. You're a pretty big man standing up there with that sword in your hand. Stand! Get up! Stand, stand, stand, stand, stand! Ah! Take it easy. I wouldn't want you to go straining yourself. I am shogun here, supreme commander of the island. I'm shogun here! Then comes Ichigawa, then comes you. I didn't figure on joining no army. You have nowhere else to go. Man, I really can't figure it out. I mean, she acts like I'm the one that killed the guy. She's gonna find out sooner or later. Just forget it. Nah, I'm just gonna have to try a little harder, be a little more charming. You know what I mean? Will you forget about that broad? We got work to do tonight. What happens after tonight? We wait. Supposing we lose? We won't be around to care. Lanes 21 and 22. Ah. Did you ever see, uh, Joe DiMaggio play? Man, you gonna have to get off this island. Doesn't anybody ever come here? Not very often. You fight them off? I kill them. With that? No guns, huh? You sure you haven't got a cannon hidden around here someplace? Oh, come on, you can tell me. Shogun Yoritomo conquer Japan in 1192-- 300 years before your country was discovered. The samurai ruled the country until 1867 without guns. They ruled with honor. They ruled with the sword. Teach me how to do it. Teach me how to fight like that. I'd scare the shit out of 'em when I get back. It's not for you to learn how to fight. Learn how to live. Where I came from, learning how to fight was learning how to live. Your childhood and mine are alike, but our desires are not. Go and help Ichigawa. Psh. I'm nobody's farmer. You're nobody's master. You are stronger now. Save your strength. Yesterday I heard the rain whispering your name, asking where you'd gone. It fell softly from the cloud on the silent crowd as I wandered on. Out of doorways, black umbrellas came to pursue me. Faceless people as they passed were looking through me. No one knew me. Yesterday I shut my eyes, face up to the skies, drinking in the rain. But your image still was there, floating in the air, brighter than a flame. Yesterday I saw a city full of shadows without pity. And I heard the steady rain whispering your name, whispering your name. Uh, one Scotch, one Shirley Temple. If you're gonna watch this show, take off your apron and order a drink. How many girls get a chance to watch their best friend become a star? You keep watching your best friend, and your best friend's gonna see you become unemployed. If you're gonna flirt with a customer, at least see if he wants a drink. Yesterday I shut my eyes, face up to the skies, drinking in the rain. But your image still was there, floating in the air, brighter than a flame. Yesterday I saw a city fool of shadows without pity. And I heard the steady rain whispering your name, whispering your name. I'm getting real tired of it all. All this hauling and carrying. Why don't we get down to the real stuff. You have to prove yourself first. All I'm proving is I can carry more wood than you can. Patience. You do not become a man until your first become a child. I'm getting real tired of it all. Very well. Would you like to try another taste of combat? Yeah. I didn't ask for no lesson in hitting somebody with a stick. If these were swords, it would be your final lesson. Tell me about it, old man. Not fast enough. Try again. Ugh! You cannot conquer the master without the sword. Now you may be ready to begin your lessons. The only thing I'm about ready for is 12 hours of sleep. It is comforting to know that one has twice the stamina than a man half one's age. I'm gonna take you apart. You never win battles in anger. If you have learned that today, you have done well. Oh. You going to, uh, let me steal you away from here? Well, I have to wait for Maria. She's going to give me a ride. I'll give you a ride. I'll bet you will. Well, you could at least tell me why. Because your contract's up. Hey, I got a kid to support. I can't go around trying to be a star, just like that. I gotta be in a place where I can sing. I gotta be where they can see me. They're gonna have to see you someplace else. Why? Because you're not gonna be here. We get this thing in shape, we could get a fortune for it. Uh, who would pay us? Well, we could, uh, put up a sign on the beach. You know, get the tourist trade. You sure you never saw Joe DiMaggio? Yeah, I saw him-- on a Mr. Coffee commercial. Mr. Coffee? It's a machine. You plug it in. Makes the best coffee you've ever tasted. Hm. What's wrong with coffee pots? To tell you the truth, Seguro, you're better off staying on this island. You wouldn't even know Japan if you went back. Ha! Japan has not changed in 1,000 years. I'd give money to see you in a Honda with an 8-track stereo. I'd give money to see Joe DiMaggio. You're very good. Thank you. Unfortunately, we don't need a singer. How come all of a sudden after five years nobody in this city needs a singer? I mean, I've been to every joint around, and nobody's hiring me. Did I come down with some kind of plague or something? I mean, five years in Mr. D's means nothing to you? What can I tell you? I just can't. You're late. We had things to do. You're doing too many things already. Hey, a man's gotta make a living. Listen to me, you ignorant bastard. You think you're gonna take over by breaking heads? You just come against the one that don't break. I got everything, from Vegas to the ocean. All you guys got is skin knuckles. And guns too, grandpa. You want a boss with a bullet in his head? You punks asked for a meeting out here. Do you think I'm gonna come unprepared? Come on, let's go! Boogie! Shit. Freeze! OK, OK. That's it, right this way. Nice and easy. Move it! Take it easy. Ugh! All right, you wanna die? Let me kill the son of a bitch. No, please, I'll do anything! Good. You wanted to put a whole lifetime of training into one hour. It cannot be done. Hm. Fortunately, neither of us is going anywhere. Uh, Kenny, this is the situation. One way or another, you're gonna pay. Now you can pay in money, or you can pay in blood. And we don't spend blood. So, now, what's it gonna be? Money. I can't hear you. Say it again. Money. Good, very good. That's very good. So we're gonna go to your office, and you're gonna make us a check. OK? Ah! Today, you are born again. Let your mind and blade be as one. As one shall you live, eat, and sleep. A mistress shall it be to you. Wear this-- a symbol of life and death to all who sees. A friend shall the long sword be to you, until death matches your step. You are a disciple now. Seek only to master yourself. Let a piece of that truth be with you always. Remember, wherever you go, the spirit of the sword. Draw it for peace, not for the cause of vengeance. You remember how we used to say we were castaways on this island? We would wish for a Man Friday. But why am I still cleaning the fish? You think I'm gonna be any good? I think you will be very good-- for an American with more muscles than sense. I trust. For 30 years, the only voice I heard belonged to him. He died a soldier. He died with honor. He died-- he died doing what we set out to do. I only hope I can live as long. He never even saw Joe DiMaggio play. We can only hope to die as well as he did. What if-- what if you can never leave this island? Sooner or later, somebody's gotta come along. What if they don't? They will. You could well be an old man by then. No older than you, and no less deadly. I did not teach you to use the sword for vengeance. Then what? You keep talking about the art. You can cut off three men's heads in one blow. You teach me how to kill people, Seguro. It's not your old world anymore. You can't go walk into a town with your sword hanging at your side and get respect. There will always be respect for a man of honor. Sure, provided he can back it up. I am prepared to die here. I'm not. There is no other way. Yes, sir. Captain, over here. Must be a straggler. They found one in Mindoro about five years ago. We didn't just find one. Someone had to bury him. I heard about that guy in Mindoro. He hid in the trees for one month before they caught him. He killed four men. Our job is to inspect the island and make a report. We'll make a report. Well, thanks for the dinner. Hey, wait a minute. Why don't you invite me in for a nightcap? No, I gotta-- Now, I mean, you can at least do that much. I gotta get up early. You got nowhere to go. I've got obligations. I gotta find a job, no matter what it is. You want to work, you can work. You're forgetting something. There's not a place in this city that's gonna hire me. You know, I've been patient with you. Why don't you grow up? This is my city. They do what I tell them to. What do you mean? Well, let's just say that I don't like a woman to tell me no. You bastard! Now, wait a minute! It's not just you. That kid needs a father. He don't need a mother like you for a father. Hey, you ever want to get on stage again-- I don't need you. Oh, yeah, you do, girl. You call me when you're ready. What are you doing? Where are you going? Somebody's on the island. Stay here. Have I told you nothing? You taught me to take advantage of a situation, and this is one situation that needs to be taken advantage of. Sergeant. Scouts out. - Scouts. - Sir. - Here, sir. - Out. Yes, sir. Why did you stop? I'm tired. We don't know where they are. We don't know whether we're running toward 'em or away from 'em. They find us either way. Then why don't we give up now? No. Seguro, the war is over. Not for me. Now. Ugh! Don't make me kill him. Tell you officer to leave. You can tell me yourself. Our orders are to clean up this island, and we intend to do it. Let me try and talk to him. We can't let you go out there alone. You can understand that. Look, I go in alone, or you'll never find him. That old man will keep you running around in circles till your hitch is up. But you're our prisoner. Hell, I am! You got sent out here to pick up a Japanese straggler. Do I look like a Japanese straggler? You surrendered. I was caught. It is not honorable either way. They are with you? No. No. You have to give up. Take these. I have no use for them. Leave me. Please. All you found on this island was one old Japanese soldier. To tell the truth, they'll never believe I found you. Sammy, take care of the other guests. Will you follow me, please? This way, sir. This is just the beginning. If I want Chinese food, I'll buy me a Chinese joint. If I want Mexican food, I'll buy me Tijuana. Whatever I want-- --just like that. Yes, sir? Don't worry about it. You're doing a good job. Thank you. Everybody to their own tastes. Will you lighten up? We got it made. Hi, how are you? We got more guys working for us than the phone company. We got this town in our pocket. I mean, just enjoy yourself, that's all. You like lasagna, you got lasagna. I'm after something a bit more spicy. Hi. Everything's OK? Enjoy yourself, life is short. Enjoy, huh? Maria, you're a singer. Just ask around, OK? See if anybody can use a waitress. You know what the answer's gonna be. I want to hear it for myself. I wish there was something I could do. There is. You got room at your place for a couple of boarders? Things that bad? She couldn't have moved, operator. It's my wife. Well, you don't show other numbers disconnected? Well, let me have the number to, uh-- to Dino's. It's, uh-- it's a nightclub. Dino's. No, she doesn't work here anymore. I've got no idea. You're one strange passenger, my friend. Hey, I see you carry your protection with you. Souvenirs. Wouldn't hurt to know how to use them the way this town's getting to be. How's that? A day doesn't go by that you don't see it in the papers-- some guy turns up in a car trunk, a restaurant gets torched. Ah, it's amazing how fast things change. I left to go overseas, this town was clean. All those guys who were getting sent up on income tax raps? Ah, the guys who got sent up are still up there. It's a whole new breed of crooks. It just happened. This guy Morelli-- Tony Morelli? Oh, look, if you're a friend of his, I take back everything I said. I mean, he's a hell of a guy. Morelli got a guy named McGee with him? Oh, like a Siamese twin. Hm. He was the best demolition man in Southeast Asia. Well, now he's the best in Southern California. After I get settled and find my wife, I think I'll look him up. Hey, where's the little woman? She moved. Well, uh, where to now? I don't know. A motel? No, I'd be too easy to find there. Look, I got a friend who owns a building. I don't know if it's your style, but might just be, might just be. Yeah. You don't take any chances, do you? It's the advantage of having a good education. This, uh, Morelli and McGee, you know where I can find them? I can start asking around. Why don't you do that. All right, all right. We gotta get these guys off the street earlier. By the time I get home, my wife's on her third dream. You're getting paid for it. You want to get laid? Tell Morell. He'll make you a pimp. Funny, real funny. Who the hell's that? Your wife. Put everything away. For what? The cops are paid. Probably one of the boys decided not to hold out. Hold your horses! Here's your pizza, sir. Keep the change. Thanks. It's about time. Where's Morelli and McGee? I asked you a question. A samurai sword. What the hell are you talking about? Morelli, the coroner was down there with a damn tape measure. He said from the size and the depth of the wounds and the thickness of the blade that that's what it was. Now, he's seen every kind of little weapon that there is. And if he says it was a samurai sword, it was a samurai sword. What the hell did I do, get some Chinaman pissed off at me? You got everybody else in town pissed off at you. They don't go around killing people. Listen, we figure it's probably some guy who lost to the numbers one time too many. Whoever it is, I want him. I managed to keep the heat off of you. Three guys got killed. Now, that's all the papers know. Three hoods got cut up, so what? Let the guy go. You'll probably never hear from him again. Look, Brooks, you better make sure I never hear from him again, you got it? Shit! Now, listen, the, uh-- the boss doesn't feel so well, OK? So I want you to be a good boy and take care of the store, all right? Sure, no problem. Here's your lasagna. Fab, take care of it, would you? Right on. Wait. Ugh! Ito, Honto? I don't know. "Honto?" What the hell's "Honto?" Kobu, don't give me that Japanese I don't understand bullshit. Now, we're losing men left and right. I want to know who's using that sword. We don't use swords. Can you see me walking through Little Tokyo carrying a sword? Somebody put a bullet in me. Let me lay something on you. I'm gonna put a bullet in you unless you get your shit together. Kobu, one of your boys is trying to take over. We want to know who it is. The company's starting to wonder what I'm doing with that cab. I came in yesterday with $1.85 in fares. I told you I'd pay you. I told you I'd help you. Where to now? Well, uh, we can try the other bars around here. The one in the middle is Suwera Kobu, the Al Capone of Little Tokyo. And my insurance man-- $100 a month nothing happens to my cab. Nobody argues about paying off? It's the way things are. Things are gonna change. Oh. Hi, Rico. How you doing, Maria? I'm OK. Oh, if you're looking for Trina, she's not here. No, uh, I promised my boss I'd have him over sometime. Well, I see you're just as sociable as ever. What do you want? Well, I want to see if you're ready to go back to work. Not for you. And here I went to all this trouble. Hey, man, I think the lady and I need to have a private conversation. Oh, you will invite me in. That's a nice looking kid. You stay away from him. Yeah. He looks just like his mama. Hey, I said you stay away from him. Hey, you want me away from him, huh? Then you're gonna have to try and get a little bit closer to me. Hey, I don't think you're trying too hard. Now, I've taken this entire town, bitch, and I'm not taking anything from you-- well, except what I want. I, uh, thought you were gonna pick me up? I got hung up. Damn different, huh! Hey what's going on? Nothing! I wouldn't go in there if I were you. You think you're better than me? You think you're too damn good? I need to-- Stop! Leave her alone! Oh, you got yourself a real tough one, Rico. Next time I tell you to keep somebody out-- OK, OK. I'll be back. I'll be back to see you again, pretty lady. Next time, have your head together. All we got is the guy's big and he's black. I'm supposed to know who he is? I don't know what it means. I'm going nuts here. You're out chasing broads. You want me to go out and buy a sword? It's not swords we need, it's not guns. I need somebody who can track this guy down. You nominating me? No, I need you here with me. What's wrong, home? You sound a little shaky. Oh, no, I'm calm. There's just some maniac out there looking to slice my head off. Doesn't bother me. What you need is a torpedo-- a professional. Rico's right. We need somebody guaranteed. I want this guy blown away. Welcome to LA. I had to do a little pushing. How do you know she's there? This guy owns a nice club. If you had a place like that and you thought some crazy cab driver was going to spill tales of the dope trade to the police, wouldn't you talk? I'll believe it when I see her. Who is it? It's me, baby. I thought you were dead. They thought so. Who worked you over? You get your things together. I'm taking you out of here. Hey. Is that him? How you doing, man? Honey, it's your daddy. Gamora. Look at this. This is my son. It's like one of those things that just never happens. Somebody comes back from the dead. It happened. Oh, baby, where'd you get that? Same place you got that. Not quite. Look at my face. I tell you, these things aren't supposed to happen. It's bad for business. What am I paying you for? Kenny, relax. Just tell me what happened, all right? All right, I'll tell you what happened. Some black dude came here looking for you and McGee. He killed two of my boys and worked me over. You ever see him before? Never laid eyes on him. Rico, send out some feelers. Find out who that gorilla is. I'll check it out. Now, Rico. Now, Rico! Move! Look, I'm paying you guys for protection. I won't to know what for. Kenny, these things happen. It's part of the business. Listen, why don't you go see a doctor, have him fix up your face? Send me the bill, OK? All right. All right, OK. Say it was him Rico saw. No, not-- not now, no. What am I, crazy? He's dead! I know he's dead, you know he's dead. I'm telling you, this is the same dude I saw. All right, OK, say it was him. Does that prove he's the one that's wiping us out? It proves he's alive. Now, you tell me who else wants us hurt that bad? Everybody in town wants us hurt that bad. Now, whoever this is, Russell or whoever, people are starting to get the idea that we can't take care of ourselves. Nah. We got it figured. It's him. What the hell did he ever know about swords? Hey, I'll take you down to the morgue and I'll show you what he knows about swords. This guy, Robinson, he better be good. I want this maniac put away. Doug? Do you want to talk about it? There's nothing to talk about. I'm OK. I wish I could believe that. This is eating you up inside. Let it go, please. I can't. The restaurant. OK. Get the hell outta here! Move! Where in the hell did come from out of nowhere like that? I'm gonna kill that maniac! I'm gonna kill him! What the hell do you expect me to do? You're the police, do something. Well, what? I'm a citizen. Protect me. I'm entitled to protection. You got three guards the size of buildings walking around with you, and you want protection? If I try to give you protection, they'll kill the protection. Look, Russell's getting closer and closer. Now, he's hit the little operations, now he's coming after me. Aw, hell, Tony. They'll never get you. Yeah, not if I get him first. You Douglass Russell? Yeah. My name is Jordan, police. Uh, this is no bust. I've been tailing you for a week. If I wanted to take you in, I would have done it before now. I want to warn you. Keep your eyes open. What are you, my bodyguard? It's just that you're doing a job we've been wanting to do for a long time. You're doing it extremely well. Keeping watch of the Dodgers? I'm not much for baseball-- not since DiMaggio. DiMaggio? You weren't even born when he was around. I was around. Baseball isn't much anymore, anyway. Nothing's the same and nothing changes. I had a son like you. He went on to become a Muslim. He didn't like baseball either. Basketball-- baseball was his game. We can put some chairs together. It's not much, but it's home. Thanks, Gamora. I really appreciate this. You know we're not gonna be safe here either. Why don't we just leave LA, get out of here? It's a matter of honor. So Robinson got knocked off. Now, don't panic. Now, I'm telling you what to do. You find this-- this Russell, and you buy him off. What have we got to lose, man? How-- how much do we offer him? As much as he wants. We can always make more money. Money ain't the problem at the moment. No, it's not. Now, hold it, Russell. Russell, $100,000. 100 grand, Russell. More-- more-- more if you want it! I didn't know I was worth so much. Rico! Rico, goddammit! Russell, now, wait! Wait a minute, Russell! It wasn't me, man. This is me. Morelli-- Morelli put it on me, man. I wouldn't do anything like that to you. Come on, Russell! Russell, I swear, I swear on my mama. Russell, please! Talk to me, Russell! Talk to me-- What are you talking about quitting? 'Cause I want to hang on to my head. I don't understand this quitting. Where do you think you're working at, Sears and Roebuck? It's all over. Everybody in town knows this guy's stronger than we are. Once we get this guy, everybody's gonna know different. Queste la verita. Is that a fact, professor? We got us the makings of an underworld czar here. After I get him, I might come looking for you. Somehow it doesn't seem to worry me so much anymore. Why, you thinking about running too? We are all running. You're all-- you're all running. You-- we-- we're all running. Well, let's run. You wanna run? Come on. Let's run! Come on, let's run! Come on, let's run. Come on, let's run. Run, run! Keep them outta here. Come on. All right, who else wants to run? Come on, let's have a marathon. Let's run. Garfoli, run. Come on, run. Run! Run! Mauricio, you, you little creep, get out. You are shit, you understand? Out, out, out, out! You're bums! You were nothing before you met me! Run, run! Come on, run! And keep running, 'cause you'll never work in this town again! You'll never work in this town again! You're finished! You're finished! Hey, hey, Tony. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Maybe you should go away for a while. Where am I gonna go? I put my life into this. I'm not gonna let it go. You're up against a wall. You men are deserting you. You just can't do this. You gotta get away. Where am I gonna go? I don't trust my own mother. You never did. Very funny. Look, Russell, anything you want, huh? Anything. Both you and McGee think everybody's got a price. McGee's the guy. He's the one that was chasing your wife. You're the one that cut my throat, Morelli. Look, I admit that. I admit I tried to kill you, but it was for money. But you're alive, man. Look, I got money hidden all over the city. So-- so you kill me, so what do you got? I can make you a rich man. Man, I'll give you half of everything. No deal. What, are you gonna stand there and let him kill me? Ugh! Get him! Ugh! Look, Russell, you just-- you just can't kill me. I should've made sure, you bastard. You can't just kill me! Thank you. Hey. How you feeling? I'm sitting up in the hospital with my goddamn ear cut off. How am I supposed to be feeling, huh? What the hell is this? This was waiting for you at the front desk. Man, just don't bring shit up into my room. This could be anything! They could bring anything-- Well, they asked me to bring it up to you. Open it. Well, open the goddamn box, Rico. So what the hell is it? Man, get that thing out of here. Come on, man, get it out. Get it out! And get my clothes. I'm checking out. Maria! Gamora. I'm sorry. I'm no-- I'm no samurai. McGee? I'm gonna get a doctor for you. Hey, relax. Nothing's gonna happen to you or the kid. All you gotta do is treat me nice. We could have gotten out of this. I told you that-- And if Russell didn't get us, McGee would have. Unless-- Unless what? Unless you kill McGee. No, no. It's too late for that now. It's too late. Rico. I thought we meant something to each other. OK, so what happened? There's no news from LA. Maria! You know where they went? McGee's got some land in Mexico. You know where? I was hoping to finish this off myself. Tell me where they are. I gotta warn you, McGee's gonna be ready for you. I want two people by the water house, I want two people by the gate, I want the house completely surrounded, and I want to know the first time anybody thinks they see anything! Well, let's go! Get outta here! Move it! Taste some, come on. Whoops! I never thought they'd do anything like this. I'm not blaming you. But I'll get us out of this. Don't be stupid. Go keep your boyfriend company. I'm feeding the baby. I said, get out of here. Now! Yeah. She's lucky she's not my type. Now, you, that's a different story. How long do you plan on keeping us here like this? Just as long as I want to. Hey. Relax. You're in my house. You're my guest. We're gonna have a real, real good time together. Hey, hold on. Now, let's get one thing straight. You're gonna be real, real nice to me, bitch. If not, you're gonna be minus one baby boy. I never liked him, anyway. He looks too much like his daddy. Where the hell do you think you're going? What do you care? Look, I'm doing this for us. My mind is made up. I don't want any part of this. I don't care, Trina. Come here! Damn it, Trina, come here! Come here, I tell you, bitch! Come here! You understand? You understand? You do what I tell you, god damn you! Bitch! Rico! What happened to the lights? The power just went out. The power just went off, my ass! Russell's here. Find him! Russell! Trina! Russell! Trina, stop! Ugh! Come here, come here. You take the balcony. Go, go, go! Balcony. You stay there, and you don't move all night long! OK, get over there. Get over there, now! Come on, move it! Get over there! Now, you tell your bloodthirsty husband that I've got his son, and I would just as soon kill him as look at him. Do you hear me, Russell? I got your son, Russell, and I'll kill him! You'll never get me, Russell, until I get him! Well, go on! Leave, you yellow sons of bitches! I don't need you anyway! Move it, bitch! All right, here we are, Russell. It's your move. Russell! I wanna talk, Russell! Come on, Russell, I know you're out there. Russell, it doesn't have to be like this. Now, take your wife and kid and go, Russell. I tried to make peace, Russell. It's not worth it. You're forcing me, Russell. I tried, but it's on you now. I'll kill 'em, Russell. I'll kill 'em. I'll blow their brains out. You'll never get me, Russell, never! You're crazy! I'll kill 'em! I'll kill 'em, Russell! I'll kill 'em! Oh, Doug. Oh, my god!
