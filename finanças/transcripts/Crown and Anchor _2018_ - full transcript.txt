James. James. What? - I want you to stay in the car on this one. Why? You know why. That's not gonna happen again. That's what you said the last time. I'm not going through that shit again. Yeah. Whatever you say. Hey. Look at me. If I need you, I'll let you know. Otherwise stay in the fucking car and don't move. Yeah. Now what are you gonna do? I'm gonna stay in the fucking car- Until you need me. A man's only as good as his word. So if I see you out there, we're through. Understand? Yeah. Good. Alright. Here we go. Jesus Christ! Get back in the car, Downey. James! You like to hit people. Huh? Yeah, why don't you try hitting me, you fuck? Arrgh. Thinks he's tough. Take his cuffs off and see how tough he is. Take 'em off, tough guy. Tough guy. Stop! What the fuck is wrong with you? Unbelievable. Un-fucking-believable. Get him in the car. Let's go. Let's go asshole. Hey! Oh Donny! Donny Donny P! Right on time. Charlie, my man. Yeah. Alright? Yeah, we're good? Ohhhh. Funny, funny guy. All good. Good. Good. I like that. Count it. That's new. Yeah. I got sent it sent over last week. Needed some good music. If I have to listen to one more diabetic fat man playing the fucking accordion I'm gonna cut my ears off. You know what I mean? I mean, right? Fucking hell man. They told me it was gonna be beautiful here. Ir's like a fucking third rate Ireland at best, isn't it? Ireland's already shit, you know. It's like all the fucking Irish retards come over here. They start fucking each other and making more fucking retards. How does it feel to be the descendant of a bunch of fucking retards? Oh-oh. Somebody's getting his feelings hurt. I'm not hurt. I just don't agree. That's all. Of course you don't. 'Cause you've lived here too long. Can't even smell the shit anymore. Maybe. So? No problems then, eh? Nothing we should know about? No. You're not using, then? What? Don't laugh. Are you using? Charlie. Jesus. Come on, man. I'm not fucking using. Don't do that. Don't fucking lie to me. That just makes you look stupid. Do you think I'm gonna ask a question like I don't already know the fucking answer? Do I look stupid? You're not stupid. I'm not stupid. So answer the fucking question. Are you using? It's just a little bit. It's nothing. It's nothing. It's nothing. You know I've heard of that before. When I was coming up, I was paired up with a guy like you. Umm, what was his fucking name? Shit, I can't think of his name. Anyway. Nice guy. Good guy. Funny. Everybody liked him. And then he started to get a little bit loose. You know. Started partying a little bit. Starting living the life. Brendan Hutchinson. Brendan fucking Hutchinson. That's his name. Called him Hutch. So the boss started to notice that standards were getting a little bit low- So far as Hutch was concerned. So he pulled him aside to have a wee chat. Of course, Hutch told him everything he wanted to hear. But nothing changed. So next the boss man comes to me. And he asks me to do something rather specific. Made my stomach churn, thinking about it. But you don't say no to a guy like that. So I fucking did it. I cut his fucking nose off. And you know, the sound that he made- was like this really- weird high pitched screaming. Never heard anything like that. I didn't think a man could make a sound like that. Point was, in the end- He couldn't snort that shit anymore, could he? He killed himself six weeks later. The poor fucker. Do you want to have a go with the juke box? It's all good shit. Hand picked by- - by me. What the fuck is that? Sorry. It's my wife. You see, you don't leave your fucking phone on in a meeting like that. You understand? That's disrespect. I know. It's just that she- You're fucking kidding me. Fuck! Ah, for Christ Almighty. Cut his fucking nose off! What? No wait! What the fuck? Just wait! Jesus fuck. Check his trousers. See if he's pissed himself. Oh! Oh man! The look on your face, man. Can I fuckin' go? What? You don't wanna stay and dance with us a bit. Hey, hey, hey! Charlie! What the fuck man! Come on! Tanz! Come on! What the fuck! Bang! Bang! Bang! Jesus! What the fuck, Charlie? Bang! Fuck! Fuck! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright. Alright. Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Go call your fucking wife. Danny! Danny! Don't get sloppy. Hey, what's up? What? Hello? Speaking. What? What? Don't do anything 'til I get there. How was the flight? Fine. Here you are. Where is she? Right there. No, where's the casket? Uh... She's been cremated. No. Where's her body? There is no body. She's been cremated. Who told you to do that? Her son. I'm her son. Your brother, then. I don't have a brother. Danny. He signed off on- He's not my brother. I'm sorry if there's been a misunderstanding. You telling me I gotta say goodbye to a pile of fuckin' dust? Uh... That fuckin' asshole. Fuck him. Not too much jam, please. Mm hmm. You're old enough. You should be making it yourself. I like it when Mom makes it. I like it when Mom makes it. Travis. Ow! Hey! It's fine. Morning. Good Morning. Did you get any sleep? Some. I can't believe they're making you work the night shift. You shouldn't have to be working at all. We need the money, Jess. I can't take time off. Still, they should be giving you paid leave or something. Weill. I don't know what to tell you. I would if I could. Hey. A little early for that, don't you think? I'm mourning. Yeah, I'm mourning too. You don't see me drinking at 10 a.m. Well, you're not me. You guys know we're going to Auntie Rose's wake this evening? Yeah. Mmm hmmm. Good. I told Val we'd give him a drive. Fine. Is Uncle Jimmy gonna be there? Don't fuckin' call him that. He's not your uncle. He's my cousin. Okay? And we don't talk to him if he's there. That goes for everyone. He can go fuck himself! Language. She's old enough. Mom. Toast please. Coming, sweetheart. I'm going out. Hey. Be back by two. Two. Hey Travis. Get back here. Why? Travis! What? Come in and put your bowl in the dishwasher. She's your mother. Not your slave. Go. Thank you, baby. Hey. Back by two, got it? Jesus fucking Christ! What is your problem? Language! I loved her. I wanna be there. Jess. We're in our own home. Who gives a fuck if we say a couple of fucks? This is not what I want modeled for her. You got it? It's okay. How's it going, Jimmy b'y? Roy Burns. Wow. Good turnout, eh? Yeah. Good turnout. A lot of people here. Yeah, she was a lovely woman. Shame Gus isn't here, eh? No. Gus is right where he should be, Roy. Still, a man should be able to mourn his wife. No matter the circumstances. Circumstances? Roy, you don't have a fuckin' clue about the circumstances. If I do say so. So, why don't you just stop talking now, alright? Roy Burns? Long time no see. Doug. How you doing? What the fuck kinda question is that, Roy? My sister-in-law's sitting right there in a fuckin' urn. Pretty obvious I'm not doing too good. Don't you think? No I... I just meant... I'm just fuckin' with you. But if you could fuck off- That would be great. I wanna catch up with my nephew here. Of course. Yeah. Um. Sorry for your troubles, there, Jimmy. Good to see you, my son. How's Toronto treating you? I see you got you some fancy fuckin' clothes. Yeah, at least mine got sleeves, Doug. What the hell? It's either this or pit stains, Jimmy. I runs hot. Is your cousin here? No. James? Yup. Father O'Brien, over at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Take it somewhere else, Father. We don't need it. You heard me. Fuckin' pedophile. Come on now. There's no need for that. You're fuckin' right there's no need. Hey. It's not worth it. Sorry for your loss. Why'd you do that? I coulda made him cry. I didn't wanna see my uncle arrested at my mother's wake. I wasn't gonna hit him. Was gonna whisper a few things in his ear. So. Where're you staying while you're in town? I got a spare room, if you needs it. Nah, I'm good. Thank you. I'm gonna stay at the house and deal with that whole mess. Right on. Well. I hope it's not too hard for you to be there, you know. How long ago was it you- You left her there? Seven years now? Eight. Eight. Right. Right. She died there, too. Poor thing. All alone. No husband. No son. Jeez, I don't know how you can stomach that guilt. I'd wanna kill myself, if I was you, Jimmy. Fuck. What? You can't take a fuckin' joke? Jimmy? Jesus. Holy Shit. Looka this fuckin' guy. What are you doing sitting over there in your car like some kinda fuckin' creep? Same thing you're doing. I don't wanna see your fuckin' family. They fuckin' hate me. I'm not gonna settle for a handshake. Gimme a hug, you bastard. Hey. It's good to see you. Yeah, you too John. How are you? Not bad. Not bad. I can't complain. I got my health. So, what's there to complain about? I... I'm sorry about your mom. I tried to call you. Did you get my message? I don't know. I turned my phone off as soon as I found out. Gotta block out all that noise. Only you would call people caring about you noise. So. How are things in the big city? Fine. Keeps me busy. You know. Must be more action than when you were here. I imagine. Yeah. Yeah definitely. I don't have every second person wanna stop and have a chat. Like around here. I'm home a day already I wanna slit my fuckin' throat. God. Jimmy Power. The lone wolf. It's James Downey. Now. Huh? Keeping your mother's maiden name alive. Yeah. I like that. How are things around here? Shit. Drugs are outta control. Things are going down the toilet. Jesus Christ. Ever hear from Gus? Yeah. Check in now and then. Doing his time. Not making any waves. He's hoping to get out for good behavior, I s'pose. Or he's just waiting to die. Yeah. You ever think about what we did? Jesus. I fuckin' knew you were gonna say that. No. I don't think about it. What's done is done. There's no point talking about it. It won't change anything. Yeah. To Rose. To Rose. To Rose. And to Gus. He should be here too. He should. And Jimmy too. I'm not fuckin' drinking to that. I can't believe he didn't come. I mean, your own mother and you don't show up to the funeral. That's messed up. Yeah, that's classic Jimmy. That's what that is. Times are tough. And he runs away. Maybe he didn't want to deal with all of you. Maybe he's a prick and he did something prickish. Why are we talking about him? Val? Why the fuck did you bring him up? Jeez. I thought it was weird. Yeah it was weird. We knew that already. But you don't gotta keep fuckin' talking about him? Jesus Christ. Let it alone Danny. Can we just please keep this about Rose, hmm? That's what I'm trying to do. And then Val brought up that piece of shit. I'm sorry. I brought him up. What. Whoever. Can we just - Please. Nobody say his fuckin' name again. Okay? Okay. Okay? Okay! Thank you. Sarah. What's your favorite Auntie Rose memory? Ummm. The time me and Travis caught her cheating at cards. But she was only cheating so she could lose and give us her money. Amazing. How much did she give you? A lot. Good job. What's your favorite Auntie Rose memory, Travis? Hey. Time for bed. Mom. I'm fine. Come on. Go to bed. Val. Gimmie a tattoo. Here we go. What? I want a tattoo for Rose. Aw Jesus. Okay. Okay, well, what's it gonna be? I dunno. What should I get? How about a rose? Jesus Christ. That's fuckin' terrible. That's cheesy as fuck, man. I dunno, man. You telling me you can draw a fuckin' rose on me? You're loaded drunk, Val. You that fuckin' stupid? Get the fuck outta here with that shit. Hey! You asked for help. He's helping. What more do you want? What a good idea. What the fuck's your problem? How about Rose? Across your knuckles. See? See? There's a fuckin' idea. My son. My beautiful son. How about you sleep on this one? You know. Before you... permanently mutilate your body. Like a fuckin' idiot. Yeah, why don't you shut your fuckin' face now. And go back to your welfare apartment, you cunt. Hey. Get offa him. The problem with you, is your dad just fucked and left. And no one ever beat any sense into you. Stop it! Eh? You hear me? You little prick. You learning now? Let him go! Shit! Jesus! I'm sorry, luv. Get the fuck out, Doug! Oh. I, I... Get the fuck out. Why couldn't you just go to bed? Huh? Jesus Mom. What the fuck? Don't you swear at your mother! Christ, you're just like the rest of them! We're supposed to be here for Rose. And this is what she gets. Sorry. Mom, I'm sorry. Travis. Go. To bed. Okay. Jesus! Give me a sec. Thanks for having me. Goodnight Val. Fuck! I'm going to bed. If you're not careful. you're gonna give yourself a heart attack. I exercise so I don't give myself a heart attack. That wasn't exercise. That was masochism. What do you want, Doug? Jesus! Is that how you welcome someone into your home in Toronto? They really are assholes up there. Okay. You gonna make me say it? I'm sorry. About what I said at the wake. Happy? James. You got any juice to drink, or what? Excuse me. Jesus Christ! Are you drunk? I was. Just haven't slept yet. Did you drive here? No one was on the road. I was just a little tipsy, officer. You gonna lecture me? You're too fuckin' old to change now. That I am. You want some water? No. Never drinks it. You never drink water. Never. And I'm the one that' gonna have a heart attack? You kidding me? Got any Eggos? No Doug, I don't have any Eggos. I have water. You're a shit host, Jimmy. You invited yourself in here. I know. I'm just pulling your dick. It's good having you home. Yeah? Yeah. Sure doesn't feel like it. I'm only speaking for myself. You're cousin, now. He's... What is it they say? He's got issues. Listen Doug. I have a lot of stuff to do around here. So if you could just get to the point. Yeah. Have you heard about all the drugs going around? I have. Normally I wouldn't care. Have at 'er, I'd say. But it's brought in some people from away. Bad lot. And they've got their hooks in Danny. He helped him get set up. And now he's selling coke for him. But of course, he's not just selling it. You know Danny. More, more, more. Yeah, right. Now back in the day, your father and I woulda handled this. And if he was here now, maybe we'd still handle it. But he's not. That's on you. So, the way I see it- You gotta handle this. Look, what I do is- a lot different than what you and Gus did. Okay, I'm a cop, I can't do what you want me to do. No. It wasn't that different. We took money from people to keep things straight. We kept people safe. Yeah, we did things cops wouldn't do. But it was for the community. Oh, it was for the community? Yeah, except if they didn't what to pay you for what you did, you'd burn their store down. That is very noble of you guys. Now, now. Don't get it twisted. We did some good. We handled that fuck who touched Danny. You know the cops wouldn't have done right by him the way we did. And so we took some money from people. Big fuckin' deal. We had to make a living. Your father had to put food on the table. My father had to put booze in his belly. Well, I dunno. Life is hard. Yeah. It is. For some more than others. It is. So, where the fuck were you? Wha? Where the fuck were you? You saw the bruises. That was between my brother and his wife. It's none of my business. Oh my God. You're so full of shit. It's the truth. No, you're just a coward. Apologize for that. No. No, you looked the other way 'cause he was your meal ticket. And that is fucking pathetic. Is it? Yeah. Look at me, Jimmy. Grade ten education. No job skills. What was I supposed to do? I'm on fuckin' welfare the last eight years 'cause of you. Because of me? Don't put that shit on me. If you'd done something, I wouldn't have had to. I tried. Hand 'a God. I tried. I asked her if she wanted to do something about it. And she said no. Said she couldn't live without him. And when you had him locked up, she wasn't the same. I'm sure she wasn't any happier. My brother has his flaws. I know that. If you'd seen our father, maybe you wouldn't think yours was so bad. I doubt that. Listen, Gus probably got what he deserved. I'm not mad at ya. And know you had your reasons. But Danny didn't do anything to you. And his situation right now... That's on you. You putting Gus away set this whole thing in motion. You fucked everyone's life up. And walked away. You don't have to do it the way we would. Use the cops. I don't care. Just fuckin' take care of it. I don't wanna go to another funeral. Okay. Good. Shake on it. I love you, Jimmy. I know what it's like. I know it's tough. You did the best you could. I'll leave you alone now, to do your chores like a good boy. When a man can make something like that for his wife- You'll be forgiven, more often than not. I can't draw a fuckin' stick man. And he can do that. It don't make sense. Can you draw? Yeah, I paint. Do ya? Yeah. Good for you. Maybe I'll let you paint me nude sometime. Jesus Christ. There's a smile. About fuckin' time. I'll be talking to ya. Wake up! Wha? Get up! Right now! What the fuck is this? I can explain. That is what I had to- Where did you get them? Jesus! Can I talk? I can fuckin' explain. I'm listening. I'm listening! I lost my job at the warehouse. What? When? Just before Rose died. Two days before. Are you fucking kidding me? Jesus, when were you gonna tell me? I was trying to figure out what to say, Jess. And, bang, she was dead. And everything was fucked. I still had to pay rent and feed the family. That's- You swore to me you would never do this shit again! You swore. I know. I was desperate. I didn't know what to do. You didn't know what to do. You coulda tried talking to me, Danny. It's supposed to be a fucking marriage. We're supposed to help each other. I am helping you. And the kids! That's why I did this! I dunno. You don't know what? You don't know if I love this family? How did you lose your job? What? It's a simple question. They're downsizing and a couple of people got let go. So you got laid off. Yes. Because there should be some kind of severance package, Danny. There should be money! You shouldn't have to do this! Well, I didn't get any. I don't know what you want me to tell ya. Are you using again? Aw, Jesus Jess. Come on! Of course not. This is just to bridge the gap between jobs. That's it. I'm gonna get another job. I'm asking around. Okay? I can't. I can't do this! You can't do what? This! I'm not doing this again, Danny. Not with kids! We live on a fucking island. Where are you gonna go if the cops come looking for you? You gonna jump in the ocean and start swimming? It's beyond stupid. Jess. Jess, look at me. Jess! You're right, okay? You're right. Come here. Come here. I only robbed one store. Oh! No one saw me. That's it. And I'm not gonna do it again. And that's the truth. Okay? I fucked up. Mm hmm. I'm sorry. You're right. Listen to me now. I will kill for this family if I had to. You guys are everything to me. Mikey! Ten shots of tequila, por favour! Wow. Looking pretty good in those glasses, old man. Do you wanna fuck at my house, or yours? Jesus Christ. You are sick, you know that? I take that to mean I won that exchange? Nobody wins that exchange, John. How you doing? Alright. Are things settling down a bit? Not really. I'm up at the house. Gotta deal with that mess. Gotta sell it, you know. Yeah, right. Do you wanna sit down, or is this gonna be quick? I'll sit. Good, because my right foot is killing me. I think I got the gout. You are old, aren't you? It afflicts many a young man too, Jimmy. Oh, before I sit down. Do you wanna drink or anything? Like maybe a rum, or beer, whisky sour, glass of wine? When are you gonna quit with that shit? When you start drinking and smoking like a normal human being. Not gonna happen. Okay, o what brings you here? I wanna solve the drug problem. Holy Fuck. God bless your optimism, but... Nobody's gonna solve that. Not even you. Not the whole thing. Just one part. Danny's part. Ah, I see. I figure I've been fighting all his fights since we were little kids. Why stop now? So how much do you know? Nothing really. Just that he's in with some pretty bad people. Do you know what they are? No. Do you? Oh yeah. I do. And I know that they've bought the King's Crown. And they're operating out of it. Okay, so raid the place and build a case. We tried that. They were clean. Made me look like a fuckin' idiot. And they fuckin' knew it, too. Oh, the smug look they gave me during that raid. It was... Holy fuck. You woulda lost it, Jimmy. Believe me. So, what can I do? You know me. I say meet force with force. But this place has gone soft. It's embarrassing. I coulda used you during that raid. No one here is made of the same stuff as you and me, Jimmy. Maybe Toronto made me soft too. Ah. You're still a bulldog. I can see it in your eyes. Christ, I wish you were on that raid with me. That smile. That fuckin' smile he gave me. I wanted to see you just knock it right off his face. You know-you give me and you ten minutes alone with these guys- And they won't be a problem any more. I'm trying not to do that anymore, John. That's a shame. What happened? Too many suspensions. It just doesn't fly up there. Some people just never understand. In the real world, the ends justify the means. Yeah. So what do you know about this Danny thing? Not much. I know he's in way over his head with these guys. Come to think of it- I wouldn't be surprised if they knew who you were. They don't strike me as they type to leave loose ends. Hey. Did you bring a piece? No. Fuck. Fuck. Hey. Follow me. Christ! Fucking foot. You alright? Yeah, I'm fine. Get my coat, will ya? Here. Take it. What's this? I don't want anything bad happening to you. Take it. Okay. Well, what happens if I gotta use it? Nuthin. Listen. Maybe you don't need it. Maybe when you talk to Danny you can work this whole thing out. But I don't wanna risk a situation where you need it and you don't got it. Just take it. No thanks. Suit yourself. Jesus, Val! You are one smart mother fucker. I can barely use a computer. And your over here building fuckin' robots or something. I dunno. I'm not that smart. It's just the way my brain works. Yeah, well, my brain's broken next to yours. That's why me make such a good team. Brains. Charm. Like that song. What song? You know that song. ♪ You got the brains. I got the looks. ♪ ♪ Ow! ♪ ♪ Let's make some money money ♪ ♪ Some fuckin' money money money money ♪ Oh my God! I'm so stressed man, you don't even know. You don't even know. Don't get a family, Val. You're smart. Stay smart and don't get a family. ♪ Money money money ♪ They fucking take it all. I can't make enough. Feeding four people. Holy Christ, man. You'd be shocked at home much that cost. You know what I was thinking about the other day? I was thinking about that movie, Casino. Sharon Stone. Yeah. Good movie. That was a great fuckin' movie. I was thinking about that scene when the slot machine gets hacked, or whatever. And DeNiro yells at the cowboy guy. Right. Do your remember that? Yeah. Fuck. He's all like: Either you're too stupid to see it. Or you were in on it. Either way, you can't be trusted. I'm firing you. I'm fuckin firing you. I'm firing you! I'm firing you. Get outta here! Get outta here! That movie's based on a true story, right? Yeah, I think so. Is that something that could be done in really life? With a slot machine? Yeah, like a VLT machine. Probably. Could you do it? Uh, I'd have to get one to open it up and see how it works. But, yeah, probably. I probably could figure it out. Do you wanna do it? Are you serious? Yeah, if I can get you one. Do you wanna do it? Sure. Sure! Sure! Yes! Yes! Yes! Fuckin' love it! You crazy fucker. So how can get get one? Easy. We just take it. Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Sorry, I was off in another world, totally. And I was just like, what the fuck is touching me, and- Is it okay that I'm here? Of course. It's- I'm sorry. I didn't call. I just was out, and... It's really good to see you. Yeah? Yeah. Hi. Hi, I thought of you and... Here I am. Here you are. Wow, it's exactly the same in here. I know. It's crazy. Right? She wouldn't let anybody in here, you know. Really? Not me. Not the kids. That door was always closed. And it was off limits. Can we talk somewhere else? Too weird being in the same room we used to have sex in. Um. So... what's new? You still at the nursing home? Yeah. Yeah? Part time. Might have to go to full time. We'll see. I keep expecting her to come in here an make me some tea. Yeah. Do you want some of her bread? Is that possible? Yes. I can make you toast and butter right now. Are you in? Absolutely. Mmmm? Mmmm. Wow. Shit, that's good. I know. I had a piece, but I couldn't eat anymore. I don't know why. I just- didn't want it to be all gone. Or something. So, you're just gonna let it go bad and not have any. I know it doesn't make any sense at all. But I just can't eat it. So how's Toronto? Fine. Whereabouts do you live? Cabbage Town. Cabbage Town? Cabbage Town. Do you live in a farmer's field or something? Yeah, I live in a farmer's field. No, it's just a neighborhood near downtown Toronto. It's called Cabbage Town. Is it nice? Mm Hmm. It's pretty nice. There's lots of different kinds of food. And culture. And it's a lot more interesting than this stale white place. So how long are you staying? I don't know. I gotta sell this place. I gotta sell the car. And, I dunno. I might just head back to Toronto and do it all from there. I really don't know what I'm gonna do yet. You gotta girlfriend you gotta get back to? No. No girlfriend. I... Actually, I haven't seen anybody since you. If I'm perfectly honest. Holy shit, Jimmy. Live a little. I know. I know, right? Just really busy, I guess. Yeah, but come on. Sixteen years, no girlfriend? Are you becoming a monk or something? No. Definitely not. Um. Just- Busy with work. Routine. You know, time just kinda gets away from me. And you were such a fuckin' nightmare- That it kinda turned me off women. That was supposed to be a joke. Jesus Christ, Jimmy. Wow. No. I'm sorry. That was supposed to be a joke. It sounded okay in my head. But it sounded terrible- It's fine. You just said it like you really meant it, is all. I didn't. I'm really sorry. It was stupid. I didn't mean it at all. It was a bad joke. Okay. Okay? Mmm hmm. So how's Danny? I dunno. Not good? He's drinking more and- I'm pretty sure he's using again. So there's that. You feel safe? What do you mean? I mean, do you feel like he'd hurt you or the kids? No. No! He's not dangerous. He's fucked up. All that shit from where he was a kid. I mean, I can't even imagine. He's never hit me or the kids. I mean, he's good to us. I can tell you don't believe me. Nah. Just struggling to understand how somebody could be a good husband and father, while drinking and doing drugs, because my father did that. And he beat the shit out of my mom right in front of me. He's not your father. Same gene pool. You got them genes too, and look at you. I mean, you're straight. You're a cop, for Christ sake. Genes don't make someone who they are. If you say so. It's bad. I'm not saying he's not hard to be with. It's just not dangerous bad. I'd be lying if I said I didn't think about leaving him once a month. Sometimes once a week. Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to take the kids and come live with you. Sorry I said. Forget I said that. Jimmy. Say something. I'm just struggling to understand why you'd think that. Because I remember what you said to me when we broke up. You said it was because I was too much like my father. Am I imagining that? Is that what you said? Jimmy don't. Did you say that? Yeah? So, why would you want me back? Just doesn't make any fucking sense! Which is it? Am I like my father or am not? You're not your father. Then why did you choose Danny over me? Because I never thought he was gonna hurt me. And I can't say the same about you. Okay. Okay. I'd like you to leave now. You brought it up. I'd like you to leave now. Just get the fuck out, right now. Thanks for the toast. Oof! Don't fuckin' move and don't make a sound! I can't hear you! Head phones! Jesus Christ! I said don't move and don't make a fuckin' sound. Just nod or shake your head. Got it? Is there anyone left in the pub? Do you have a key to the back door? Is there an alarm system? Do you know the code to turn it off? Good. Now, here's what's gonna happen. We're gonna walk right through that back door. You're gonna keep looking straight ahead. If you turn to look at me. If you try to fuckin' run. If you make a sound. I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. Do you understand me? Good. Now let's go. Look straight ahead. And don't you fuckin' look at me, you understand? That's it. That's right. This way. Don't you fuckin' look at me. That's right. Straight ahead. Atta boy. Up these fuckin' stairs. Now. Don't you be stupid, okay? Don't you be stupid. Whoo! Whoo! Now. Stay right there. Don't you fuckin' look at me. Don't you fuckin' move. Now. I want you to open that door. And go straight to the alarm. Go! Don't fuck up. Don't Don't! Val. Get the keys. Give 'em to him. Try it again. Don't be fuckin' stupid. Go. Right to the alarm. Go, go, go. Val, turn that fuckin' light off. Over here. Now you fuckin' stand right here. And don't you fuckin' move. You know there's not much money in those. Just coins. Ugh! I told you not to make a fuckin' sound, didn't I? Don't touch it. Let it bleed. Come on, Val. Fuck, give me a hand. It's too heavy. Help him. Just fuckin' help him! Just help me tip it off the wall so we can put it on the dolly. Come on! - What the fuck? - What's wrong? - Fuck! - Val! Turn that fuckin' light off. - It's fuckin' connected. - What? - It's fuckin' connected. Look. - Turn the fuckin' light off. You got a bolt cutter in the van? - I got one at home. I could go get it. - Goddamn it! Mother fucker! Uh. Hey! Hey! Fuckin's stay here! Hey! Hey! Hey. Is Danny here? No. Is that all? Look. I realize I can be really hard to be around- Most of the time. And I just need you to know- That I would never hurt you. And I'm really sorry about being rude to you. Okay. Jimmy, wait. Danny didn't come home last night. Fuck! Okay. Okay. Whooa! Hey! Fuck Face. Put all the Lotto cards and the cash in a bag now! Before I blow a hole in your fat fuckin' gut! Do it! Oh my God! On the ground, now! On the fuckin' ground! Faster, you old fuck! Faster! Faster! Shut up! I"m not gonna hurt you! What the fuck? Fuck you, you little prick! That's it! Run! Run! Ya little prick! So, what did you tell Travis and Sarah? That he was sick in bed. They're gonna be home from school soon. I don't know what I'm supposed to say. You'll figure something out. It's okay. What the fuck is this? Where the hell were you? Out. You couldn't call me? What the fuck is he doing here? What did you do to your hands? Nothing! What the fuck is he doing here? I'm sitting right here. You can talk to me. What the fuck are you doing here? I came, actually, to talk to you. You weren't here. She let me in to wait with her. You couldn't wait alone? No, I couldn't. I thought you were dead! Bullshit. What, did he spend the night? Did you fuck him in my bed? Danny. There's nothing going on. Yeah, well there's something going on. 'Cause you're in my fuckin' house. And I don't want you in my fucking house! Alright. I'll leave. No. No, you stay. Okay. He's here because you weren't. I was out there trying to provide for this family. Oh. Are you fucking kidding me? If you want to provide for this family, get a fucking job. Good luck with that, now that you broke your fucking hand. Baby, listen. Don't. Do you have any idea how close I am to taking the kids- And leaving here? Do you? What, are you gonna run off with this prick? Maybe. Maybe not. It really doesn't matter. It matters. No it doesn't. You should be worried about losing your family. Not who I'm going to fuck when I leave here. Jess. I don't know what you think is going on, but - You're on fucking drugs! That's what going on. We just wanna help you. Don't you fucking talk to me! Doug told me all about what was going on, Danny. What the fuck does he know? What? He knows that you're in way over your head. He knows that you're doing some really bad things with some really bad people. Oh yeah. Here we go. Bad, bad. Bad. Jimmy Power and his fuckin' moral judgements. No judgements here, man. Yeah, right. Look at ya. You look like you wanna fuckin' puke right now. Oh poor Danny. He needs me. I don't need you to help me. I don't need you to save me. What makes you so much better than me, Jimmy? Huh? What is it? I raised a family with this woman. It's a lot harder than anything you've ever fuckin' done. Look. I know you got your problems, Danny. And I'm just trying- Oh God! Yeah here it is. Everything is because of my problems. Because I got fuckin' molested. Yeah. Pretty much. Am I wrong? Fuck you. Hey. Danny. No. No. Fuck you. Fuck you! Fuck you, Jimmy! You wanna talk about problems? Let's talk about some fuckin' problems. What's punching a hole in the wall next to this girl's fuckin' head, huh? Is that fuckin' normal? Is that fuckin' normal? Just because you don't drink, doesn't make you a good person. Ever look in the mirror, huh? See Gus staring back at you? You better watch yourself, Danny. Actually, you know, I take that back. Your father's a better man than you'll ever be. Are you that fucked up that you can't see Gus for who he is- Because of what he did for you? Is that what's going on there? At least he fuckin' believed me. No one else did. You sure as fuck didn't. When I told Mom that he made me suck his dick- she slapped me for lying and made me go back and see him again. And as soon as Gus found out- He took care of it. He put a fuckin' stop to it- so it can never happen to another kid again. And what did you do? You waited. And you waited. Until you could find someone to help you. And then you did it. You put him in jail for it. Your own fuckin' father. Life in prison. For killing a priest. A twisted, soulless fuck of a priest. But that didn't matter, right? Because you had evidence. And you had Woods. You have no idea what it was like to live with him. You have no fucking idea. You ripped her heart out. You know that, right? Rose. You ripped her fucking heart out. That's enough, Danny. Shut up, Danny. You pissed all over everything. She was on fuckin' welfare because of you. Shut up, Danny. I had to take money from my kids and my family to help her. You weren't her son. I was. Shut the fuck up, Danny! I was her son. Shut the fuck up, Danny! I was her son. Shut up! And all she wanted was to see you again. Shut up. To touch your face. Shut the fuck up. She asked about you every day. Shut the fuck up, Danny. Every day. She asked about you every fucking day. Shut the fuck up, Danny. Shut up, shut up, shut up. Danny. That's enough. Shit! They're home. Listen to me. This stops right here. You here me? I don't want them a part of this. So that's it now, right? Just like that. You're gonna run off to Toronto together. Is that it? That's alright. It was hard to fuck her anyway. Her cunt smelled like you. Stop it! Uh! Stop it! Don't you touch her! Stay away from her! Danny! Danny! Are you okay? Are you okay? Jesus! What is wrong with you? Baby! Please. Arggh! Could you repeat that just one more time, please? Um, which part? All of it. I was coming down Prescott Street to bring you your money. And someone jumped me. And he hit me from behind. He hit me in the back of the head. And he kicked me in the face a couple of times. And he took the money that I was bringing to you. And I tried to get up to see him. But I didn't fuckin' see anything. And that was yesterday, was it? Yes. Two-three o'clock. Three o'clock. Fuck, that's bad luck isn't it? Fuck me. That's bad luck. Yeah. That's bad luck. Well, here's the thing. Well, two things really. One. It's really hard to believe a coke head. I'm not saying your lying. I'm just saying- I mean, obviously something's happened. Look at your fucking face, right. But- What exactly it is that happened- I don't know. Maybe you got stuck with your hands in the cookie jar, did ya? Maybe you deserved it. I see you've got a broken arm. Did you get that in the punch up, did ya? Charlie, man- Two. I don't understand what this has to do with me at all. Someone stole your fuckin' money. No. I would say someone stole your fuckin' money. Allegedly. Nobody took anything from me. Except possible you, if you don't fucking repay me. Right? Charlie. When have I ever not fucking paid you, man? When have I ever lied to you, huh? You could lie to me all fucking day long. I don't fucking know. And I don't fucking care. Because you always fucking pay me on time, don't you? Fuck. yeah. That is a good song. Es ist jenseits von Gut. Okay. Just listen to me for a second. I can get you - Shultz. I can get your money for you, okay? I don't have it now, for obvious reasons. But if you give me a couple of more days- Give me two or three days tops, okay? I can fucking get our money for you Charlie. I swear to God! This is no big deal. I can fucking- Fuck! Fuck! I don't want to hear your fucking voice anymore. Do you understand? It's really bothering me. Charlie- See, there you go again, talking! Da da da da da da. I don't want to hear your fucking voice! Stick your tongue out. Why? Because I'm gonna cut off. Nothing crazy. Just a little bit. You know what I mean. You'll still be able to talk. You just might have to repeat yourself a lot. But you'll find you get used to it. Listen. I have a son. I have a son. I don't fucking care what you got. Stick that tongue out. Listen to me. You don't understand. He can sell for you. Okay. He's fifteen. He can get into high schools. Into parties, anywhere. Stick your fucking tongue out- or I'll cut through your fucking cheek right now! Just think about it, please! Fuckin' think about it! Think about it, Charlie! It's good business, right? It's good business. Just think about it. Please. Please. Please. Just fuckin' think about it. Alright. Let him go. Fuck! You wanna bring him here tomorrow, right? And if I like him, he's gonna go to work for me. And you've got three days to pay me back. With interest. Okay? And if I don't like him- He's gonna watch you get mutilated. Schultzy here is gonna hold him down while I cut off your fucking hand. Or maybe this foot. Maybe that ear, eh? Maybe these lips. Huh? Huh? You understand, yeah? Yeah. Good man. Stand up, ya cunt. We got a fucking deal, yeah? Yeah. Ah! Get the fuck out of here. Is the music too loud? 'Cause I can turn it down. Nah, that's good. Just pause for a minute, will you? How's it going? Good. How's your face? It's nothing. Can barely feel it. How's you neck? It's fine. That's good. So, what's up? Have you ever done drugs? Uh. You're not in trouble or anything. I'm just curious. Feels like a trap. It's not a trap. Answer the question. Smoked a bit of weed before. That's it. Why? I smoked weed when I was your age. And drank. I used to get all fucked up and start acting like an asshole. I was sloppy. Don't be sloppy. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I think I wanted someone to hurt me. You ever fell like that? No. Dad? Dad. Yeah. So, what I need for you to do- Basically. Dad, spit it out already, man. Never mind. What? Never mind. I'll take care of it. Alrighty. Get up. What? Get up and give me a hug. Why? Get up and give me a hug! Why? 'Cause I'm your fucking father and I want a hug, that's why. Now get up here. Jesus. You're a good kid. Yeah. Don't loose that, alright? Don't. Jesus! Alright, bye, Jesus. Come on. Can't a father love his son? Sure. What's wrong with admiring your face? Nothing. Just, please, please do it from a distance next time. Okay? Yeah. Please. Alright. See ya. Jesus Christ. I've never seen anything like that. Holy fuck. Hey. You did good. Don't worry. Everything's gonna be alright. They tried to run. You had no choice. You just got lucky with a head shot. Right? Does that sound okay? Hey Jimmy. Can you give me a nod, or something? We gotta be on the same page on this. I had a choice, John. I chose to kill them. You reacted! No. No. They were unarmed. Jesus, Jimmy. You did the right thing there. They had it coming. Yeah. I"m gonna need you the get out of my car now, John. Jimmy. Look, please don't worry. I'll handle the whole thing. Please get the fuck out. Fuck off, Jimmy. Get out. You look like shit. Mmhmm. I like to think of it as character. Good to get me some roles in Hollywood, when I get outta here. See, they can't teach a face like this, me b'y. Is that what you're gonna do if you don't die in here? Become a big movie star? A man can dream. Last I checked. Can't take that away. You never know who might be on the ship. You're grandfather said that to me once. You remember him? Yeah. He used to tap dance. Did I ever tell you that? No. But Mom did. Yeah. Well he danced up a fuckin' storm. 'Til they put plastic veins in his legs. Then he'd sit in a chair. And go through his steps half time. Anyways. I took him and your grandmother- down on a cruise around Florida once. Now that would have been in- What year were you born? Nineteen seventy seven. That was seventy six. You might have been conceived on that cruise. Yeah. Anyways. He's unpacking his suitcase, when I stopped by with you mother- See if he wanted to go out for a bite to eat. And he's pulling his tap shoes out. I laughed and I said: Still waiting for the big break, eh b'y? Crack! Smacked me right across the face. Right in front of your mother. Right in front of my mother. Cut me. Above the eye with his ring. Anyway, he goes back to unpacking. He said: You never know who might be on the ship. So... Did you drop by to apologize for putting me in the fucking place? Or what? You put yourself in here, old man. I beg to differ on that little point, Jimmy. The way I see it, it was you. And that fuckin' piece of shit, Woods put me in here. Oh, it's okay. It's all good. I forgives ya. Yeah, you done me like God did Jesus. But I can take it. 'Cause I'm a man. And, besides. I haven't been completely abandoned. Family come in often, do they? Me brother, not so much. Once or twice. But Danny. Once or twice a month. Yeah, he's a good one, Danny. Comes by for a little advice. Stuff like that. You know, he always showed me- the respect a father deserves. Yeah, you really bought his love, didn't you? I did right. And he knows it. You knows it too. You just don't wanna say it. You wanna know where all your great advice got Danny? Danny's doing all right. Yeah, he's doing alright- for someone who just got his fuckin' nose cut off his face. Well. That wouldn't be my advice. Danny must have done something to deserve it. You know Danny. He was always too emotional. Shame I'm in here. Never woulda happened on my watch. No. I woulda handled it. I handled it. They're dead. Atta boy. How'd you do it? Gun. Gun? Oh no. That's not good. You gotta use your hand if you wanna be a man. But, I bet it felt good though, did it? So. How was your mother's funeral? I hope as beautiful as her. You know... I had a little drink in her honor. Now, come one. That was funny. Eight years you been in here. You still can't dry out. They're not as clever as you were. You know you still owes me for all those bottles you emptied on me when you were a little fucker. Ten years old. Outsmarting someone as smart as me. I shoulda hit you up side he head. Dulled that big fuckin' brain of yours. Maybe I wouldn't be in here now, huh? Fuck. You know, I'd kill for a fuckin' kit in here. I would. Ease the tension. Know what I mean? You still play? Nope. Probably all for the best. You never were as good as me. All that fuckin' fast shit you used to play. Nuthin' but noise. No art to it. ♪ Sonny don't go away. ♪ ♪ I am here all alone. ♪ ♪ And your daddy's a sailor, who never comes home. ♪ ♪ And the nights are so long And the silence goes on ♪ ♪ Im feeling so tired I'm just not that strong ♪ Nuthin'. Fuck. Tough crowd. Mom always used to say that you had a sickness. That when you were drinking, it wasn't really you. That I shouldn't hold that against you. Because you weren't yourself. She said that you were Jekyll and Hyde. She was full of shit. You were always being yourself. You're just a fuckin' scumbag. Why'd you come here, Jimmy? To call me names? Or do you need a hug? I just needed to know. Know what? Know that I'm not like you. Well, I'll tell ya. I'm in there somewhere. Maybe. Mom is too. She's gonna do what she shoulda done a long time ago. Yeah, what's that? Kill you. Never woulda happened. See, she loved me. Even more than she loved you. That's fuckin' bullshit. Is it? Mm hmm. Do you remember the time you tried to fight me? You were a little bigger, so you probably thought you could take me. I remember. I remember I shoulda brought a fuckin' baseball bat. Nah. You gotta have the stomach for something like that. You were too sensitive. How old were you then? Seventeen? Eighteen? Just turned eighteen. And what happened? You were a full grown man. You overpowered me. Uh huh. And then what? Then I left home. I'll tell you what I remember. I remember your mother pulling you aside- And slapping the shit outta you. And you crying like a little baby. As she threw you out the front door. And told you never to come back. You see. She picked me. She could never stand to see you hurt me. She picked me over you. And that- is the meaning of true love, my boy. Yeah. I did. I had a drink to remember her. You see, she always loved it when I'd take her to bed drunk. She liked it rough. Truth hurts, doesn't it, boy? I know you don't wanna talk about it. But the kids have got to see you. Jess. They can't see me like this. They love you. They miss you. They don't care what you look like. You know the doctor said that if I cry- it could fuck up the surgery. And if they come in here and I see them- I'm gonna cry. So please just drop it, okay? Okay. You're right. I'll explain it to them. Ugh. This is shit. You gotta eat. Come on, you gotta eat. You gotta get better. You gotta get outta here. Can you run out and get me something else? Yes. Will you eat it? Mm hmm. What do you want? Burger and fries from Ches's? Done. Anything to drink with that? Surprise me. Jesus Christ, your face! You look so much better. Ha ha. Love you. I love you. Is this a bad time? No, I'm just going out to get him some real food. What's wrong with that there? It's shit. That's what's wrong with it. Well, it looks fine to me. You come eat it. I will. I'll be back soon. Yeah. Alright. You sure now? I'm sure, Doug. It tastes like shit. Well, you haven't even touched the meat. Tell you what. I'll be your taster, alright? Yeah, go right ahead. Just like with the King of England. Just in case it's poison, you know. It's not that bed. Better than I could make. You make it sound like you need some cooking class or something. Nah. I knows how to open a can. Use the microwave. Jesus Christ. Hey, we can't all have fancy tastes, your Majesty. Want the pudding? No. You-you hear form Jimmy? No. I tried calling him. But there's no answer. Sounds about right. Did you talk to him at all? Like in the ambulance, or anything? No. All I heard was gunshots. I didn't know it was him until I was on the stretcher. And he didn't say a word. He didn't ride in the ambulance with me. Doesn't surprise me. Did I ever tell you about when he told his mother- Gus was going to prison? No. Were you there? I was dropping something off at the house. He comes in. Stands in the kitchen. No hello. He just says it. Bluntly. In one sentence. She kept asking him, Why? He just stood there like a statue. She started crying- Hitting him, slapping him. His face didn't change, I never saw anything like it. I had to pull her away. Jesus. Yup. He was gone a few days later. But- such is life. This is a final boarding call for flight one eighty two with non stop service to Toronto. All remaining passengers should be boarding through gate number three.
