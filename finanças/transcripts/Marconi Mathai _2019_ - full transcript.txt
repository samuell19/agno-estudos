Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. O' Saint Timothy in heaven, glory to you too! Please convey my respects to Saint Sebastianos and Saint Rocky. It must be due to the faith upon you and me, the number of believers who want to offer prayers through letters, is increasing day by day. Please give me the strength to write much more. For reading the past 3027 letters, and for intervening in the matters, and helping the believers, I thank you specially, on behalf of the believers and myself. God bless you! [Speaking in foreign language] The Saint knows this Britto's handwriting. He gives it special consideration. Tell me. We have lived together for so many years. I just need a divorce. Divorce? You can actually go and tell this to him directly. You can meet him personally in 2 years, right? [Speaking in local language] Francis. If my uncle gets cured, I'll gift a brand new golden cross to this Church. I don't care if he doesn't take care of me and kids. Just give him some sense to send us money on time. A lot. Take this. Tell me. Tell me, sister. I just want to see the person I'm searching for, somehow. That's fine. Say the name first. Anna. - Anna. Whom have you come in search of? The soldier. Soldier? I came here hearing that the Saint here grants every wish that's written to him. That's sure. Your wish will be granted. Hey! What's the name of that soldier? Mathayi (Mathew). Is Mathayi there? Isn't it Luca on the line? Luca? This is Kunjumon from the toddy shop! Luca boozed by mortgaging his phone and some other stuff, and then left. Mathayi is not with him. What do you want? My dear people, my fellow men, I'm bidding farewell. Vallamkari's sweetheart, Thekkethadathil Chackochan, has departed for his final journey. We cannot bear this demise. To take part in this sorrow... Sing! Sing! Who? Mathayi? Mathayi is not with me. Chackochan's children reached late. The funeral got delayed. The climax is going on. Why don't you ask Babu? Ramanan, if you want to find a good girl, you'll have to run around like this. There's a beautiful girl standing under the Kidangara bridge. She looks like Sunny Leone. I'll set you up! It's Babu's word! Carry on! Go! Go! Hey! Lock it. I'm leaving. - Hello. Vasuetta... Mathayi? Babu Chetta... What's the matter? Afsu, did you see Mathayi? Can't you see? Mathayi is over there. Mathayi, where are you? Our Kunjachan had his fifth heart attack. Seems like God will take him. Here. Can you hear me? Looks like things will go out of control. He is at home, and everyone has surrounded him. Heard that they will bury him, no matter if he dies or not. His children have given an order for a coffin. And they have asked to print a flex with a photo of Kunjachayan in a suit. That's too much! Can you come now? I'll put him on. Here. Where are you, man? They are not even allowing us inside the compound, to see him. His children are saying that he won't die if he sees us. Okay then. What did he say? He said that Kunjachan cannot leave without asking his permission. Then he will come! What are you looking at? To see something, you should open that window, right? So I can only see what's in the room, right? You deserve a beating for this! You'll get it from me most probably. Go ahead. Hit me! It would feel great to die, getting hit by you! She is smart! 'In this dim light in the dark, an angel like red fire' 'Has come from the sky, with the message of my death' Yeah, right! Message of death! Crap! Who's that? This is Christ. I have come to take you. Then do one thing, Christ. Leave now. And count how many candles are still burning at the chapel in Cheriya Kadavu. By the time you finish counting, this Kunjachan will finish some pending tasks. Go! Then so be it. As you wish! Stop there, man! Let me see your face. Shouldn't I check whether it's same as what I see in photos or at the altar? You sweet rascal! You'll die even if you get shot, or get poked by a cow, or even if a coconut falls on your head. Death will approach whichever way it wants to. Within that, should you forsake your desires? Shouldn't we have a blast? Isn't that called life, you rascal? Are you taking a family man on a vehicle stolen from a foreigner? You've become quite glamourous! Check if there's an 'Elanji' tree over there. I can't see any Elanji trees here. I can see two headless coconut trees. And two bra's on the clothesline. Must be Shoshanna's. You won't see if it you look. To see that, you need to have a lover in you. Mathayi... - Yes. You have a look. Kunjachan! You Romeo! That's where I saw Shoshanna for the last time. Back then, girls used to see even their husband's faces properly, only after getting married, settled down, and having kids. It was during those times, that she came to me before going to her bedroom, on her wedding night. The warmth of her lips, and the warmth of her tears that dropped on my hand, It's still burning. How can I leave from here, without lighting a candle for that remembrance? Now give me the extreme unction. I shall leave. So I'll give him the extreme unction? Do you want the extreme unction with water or without water? Mathayi, one for me too. - I'll have it dry. Then drink it like you drink your mother's milk! [Imitating Sanskrit news on Radio] You stay there with this age old programmes! On the other side, the FM radios are having a blast! You must update yourself! I will lay my hands on that FM one day. Then... Then I will divorce you! Mathayi! Marconi Mathayi! Good morning, sir. Very good morning. Tune that radio, sir. Today we will capture the FM channel. Mathayi is on the coconut tree again. We've reached Vallamkari. Come on. Get down. Make it fast. You want to spread your gospel by falling on to women? I lost control, sister. Control, it seems! Not mine. The control of the bus. Mathayi has been turning that antenna for many days now! Will we get FM channels in our town? Mathayi has fixed a magnet there, to capture songs whichever direction they may go through! Can you get Sri Lanka? I'm not getting Sri Lanka. But I can see an edge of Sri Lanka standing here. That's enough. Catch it and climb up! I'll call you later. - Hey! Reena! Mathayi has started hunting for signals in the morning! Phones have good signal here anyway. Stop it! You would have killed me now. So Chedathi is here with a bunch of kids. Check if there's some strike today. - Stop teasing me and walk fast. Chedathi, is there any new loan schemes? Only for goat, chicken and cow! - That's great. There are loans for goats, chicken and ducks! But no loans for humans! It's so hot in the morning itself. Climb up fast, Chedathi. How can I be fast in this age, sir? Keep tuning it. You can sweep after that. Mathayi is saying that he'll catch hold of the station today. My dear brother Mathayi, that building is as old as the earth. If you don't stamp carefully, you will fall down! Can you hear anything? I can hear only a sound that goes 'Prrrr'... Now? Keep turning it, Mathayi. I can't hear anything. Turn it a little more. ['Dum Maaro Dum' plays on radio] Stay here! Sir, Namaste. [Hit Malayalam song playing on FM] Got the FM channel? Catch! Your Mundu! Okay, right? - Yes. A medium strong tea for me. Tea! Tea! Babuetta, no snacks with tea? Songs are the snacks with tea hereafter. Are you sitting here in a romantic mood, listening to music, my dear Saramma? I went up to prepare lunch. With all the smoke and fire, that old breathlessness came back. That's why I sat down. Here. The tea is really strong! It's not as great as what you make. But still, we can adjust. Have it. I am not well, son. I've started coming in my younger son's auto rickshaw now. The parents of the kids' who travel in the vehicle, don't like me travelling in it. They must be concerned that my cough and illness would spread to them. And there's no point saying that he's my son. If I don't pay the auto fare correctly, I'll have to see his anger too. I've asked Manager sir to arrange someone to sweep the place, to make tea and cook lunch. Let me rest at home for some time. I'm not well at all. Or I'll die here. Look... There's that old trap you laid for Yohannan Chettan, by doing the Margam Kali dance, right? Try to remember that trap! If you remember all that, half your diseases will go away. Come on, get up [Traditional 'Margam Kali' song] It's not like that. - Then? Johnny, son of Tharaparambil Varkey! This whole world is your bedroom. You are a seed-bull on the bed, and on the farmlands. When you booze, may you be a laughing rose flower. And then drink it like you drink your mother's milk! Stop it! First you go and get married! Get married, sing and pray for the well being of others! Get going! Hey! Come here. You sing the rest, man! Come on, shoot! What do I say? 'What do I say?' 'What do I say?' Everyone wants to hang out and booze with Mathayi. When that old hag disgraced him in front of all those people, none of you opened your mouth! I can forget that. Even after hanging out with him, have any of you asked why Mathayi hasn't married yet? There are people with you, who get other people married twice and thrice! Let it go, sister. No, Mathayi. We can't let it go like that. Mathayi... What Mary said is serious! Great! God has found a girl for you somewhere. If you don't find her and marry her, she would stay there, grow old and ruin herself. Oh my God! You will be answerable to God! That's okay! So don't you want to marry? No. Is it the night toddy? No, sir. It's the morning toddy. Mathayi, I have a doubt. Do you have any biological malfunction? Get lost! Are crows and cats getting married? Like that, Mathayi will also live happily. That's it. Good morning! - Hey! Wait. 'There is Puttu' 'There is Puttu powder too' 'There is Puttu... There is Puttu powder too' 'Come, come, Puttu. Come, Puttu powder' 'Why do we need money and fame?' 'We have the Puttu and the Puttu powder too' Why have all of you come in the morning itself? We came to take you. Hold him. Mathayi, come. All are fresh tomatoes. Select a nice girl from this, Mathayi. Are your armpits always sweaty because you keep so many girls there, Babuchetta? Get lost! Marriage proposals even before brushing my teeth in the morning? - Look at this. This is why all of you came here now? Mathayi, shut up and select a photo from this. This is nice. Your sister is also here. What are you doing here, Lali? Don't change the subject. Luca Mapla... I was after him for this, for so long. This time, if all of you stand by me, we can take a decision about it this time. Mathayi, come here. I also need tea. - Show him those photos. Here. Look. All are good. Good girls. Here it is. - Let me see. Nice. - Treesa Joseph Thuruthikkunnel. Nice name. - She is Ousep's grand daughter. From a great family. - Then it will be a good match. So, how much would you earn from the army every month? Well... - Six full bottles. We drink four of them, and sell the rest. He gets a pension of 20,000 Rupees every month. And he has a great bank balance! So even the salary from the bank comes as a balance. What about your sisters? The eldest is Roselyn. She is in Surat. The second in line are twins. Both of them are in Thrishnappally. Then it's me. Lalimol. I stay at Pooppara. Brother, shall I call the girl? Why don't we wait for 'Death'? Here he is. We just spoke about you. You'll live long, 'Death'. The funeral got delayed. That's why I got late. Hey! I've seen you at a lot of places. You must have seen me. For your neighbour Chackochan's funeral. I was the one who sang for it! Oh! So you were the one who sang and made that scoundrel into a Saint? So what? Vijayan Chettan will sing and make you also a Saint, grandpa! Is it time? Call her. I... Babuetta, nice, right? I couldn't see properly. How is she? If you want to talk to the girl, you can go inside. Can I get some water? This is full of flowers! Do you like music? [Reciting an old Malayalam song 'Kadalivazha'] Do you know which movie it is from? Shall I say it later? By later, you mean when? When we meet next time. So will we meet again? How can we not? That's the signal. Let me go. See you soon! I know you all have been eagerly waiting... So now he will interact with us. I need that! I won't give it back. It's okay. Keep it. Hello everyone! I think all of you know why I've come here. It's the poster launch of my next movie 'Shall I tell you a love story?' Sir, please move. Here's the poster of 'Shall I tell you a love story?' I'm really excited. And the main reason for that... is that this time I'm going to stay here, talk to you and interact with you. For some time, it will be only about the only universal language that all of us can speak - Love. I will be talking about love. I am also very excited And, I love you. I love you all. Thank you so much. Thank you, sir. Yes, Vijay Sethupathi is live on air. I think it's a dream come true moment. And also. did you hear what he said? - Yes. He said a punch dialogue too. Hey Mathayi. You're not any ordinary Mathayi. You are Marconi Mathayi. He said he will come to our houses. Like that, he said he will come to our offices. He said he will come to our cars. - Yes. He said he will come even on our headphones. There is some clue in it. Didn't you understand what it is? Anyway, before telling our listeners about it, shall we come back with a superb track? - Yes. A small break. Happy? - Of course! Super happy! There will be a flood here. The clouds will rain fire! Soldier! Soldier! Soldier! Can I have that gun? What for? - I need to shoot that guy in white! Praise the Lord! - Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Give this. - Tea. [Super hit Malayalam song playing on FM] Good morning, sir. - ' Morning. Mathayi. Where were you? I was looking everywhere for you. What for? - Have this tea. You're lucky! - What's the matter? - Treesa's father had called. They are okay with it. That's all? Look at you! Feeling all shy! Feeling shy? - What are you doing? When? Our Saramma Chedathi is no more. Saramma Chedathi is gone. Saramma Chedathi is no more. Some time back. Can't believe it. Was it in the hospital? - Yes. Did they say anything about the funeral? - No. Shouldn't we go there? - Of course. Zacharia sir wouldn't have known, right? - No. Sir, come. Until she stopped studies after 4th grade, Saramma and I were in the same class. The bank employees left only now. This is really sad. Leave it. What did Treesa's family say? Say that. It is okay. The family is interested. She's their only daughter, right? So they have a small condition. Whatever Mathayi has, should be written in her name. That's all. Call them and say that this wedding won't happen, Babu. What are you saying? Mathayi's farms don't have a fence, sir. The crops here are for the birds that fly down here. To write it off in her name.... Let it go. What is his problem? - Anyway, she was a nice girl. Seven Eight Eight Four Sleep... Sleep... Sleep, Mathayi... Sleep... To enthrall our viewers, To overjoy them with adrenalin rushes, here comes Royal Circus. At Vallamkari Vani ground. 4 shows, daily. With the acrobatic skills of the north, and the charm of Russian circus combined, a new visual experience! To enjoy holding your breath, risky car and bike jumps! To enjoy without batting an eyelid, trapeze by Russian artists. Come here, my darling! Colourful juggling... Come and enjoy! Royal Circus! At Vallamkari Vani grounds. Daily 4 shows. Hey! Come here. What happened? - Come here. Who did this vulgarity? What is the vulgarity in this? Who kept this broom on top of my gun? So didn't you know, Mathayi? There's a new replacement for Saramma Chedathi. A replacement without my knowledge. Who's that? Look! Over there! There she goes. Look. Jesus! Brother, can I make a call? - Yes. Hello, Father. - Anna, dear. It's me. Can you hear me? - Yes. Tell me. Father, the roads here are quite busy. No one knows to drive properly. One guy would have hit me now. - Did anything happen to you? - No. They would have taken him to the hospital now. Then there's a Jesus Christ here. Not like our Church. He's always smiling here. Who's that Christ whom I don't know? - I feel really happy when I see him. Father... There's a shop nearby. They sell only salt there. Eapachayan's salt shop. It's time for me to go to the bank. I'll tell you the rest later. Okay then. Bye. Are you the new person who has come in place of Saramma Chedathi? Did you understand who I am? Can you give me a clue? Do you know what this is? - That's my broom! Is it? Then what about this? Gun! - So you know it! Keep your broom at some corner. Instead, don't keep it on top of my gun! I'm not just an ordinary security guard. I am a soldier. Hey! See, I really don't have time. I need to make at least 3 curries for lunch. And then snacks and tea in the evening. Manager sir has asked for all those. Then I've to do the sweeping & cleaning too. I don't have time to waste. It's going to be fun. See you, soldier! Go... go Stop! Now go... Retired soldier, right? A retired soldier and a gun without a bullet are the same! No bullet? - Yes. If you need a bullet, you need to ask Manager sir, right? There's no problem if this broom sits on top of a bullet-less gun. Both are the same! Mathayi, so it doesn't have bullets? Why? You wanna see? Do you want to? - No. Tea. Please sign here. You go to the village office and get the tax receipt... What's your name? Anna - What? It's Anna! The tea is good. And the one who made it too. Is it special? Now it's not just one, but two people. Don't leave your stomach empty. Thank you. - Drink it fast. Mathayi. Mathayi... You said you'll kill her... Didn't you? For that you need bullets in your gun, right? - One slap... She is a girl. Otherwise, you'd have seen! Whatever it is, she should be appreciated. She impressed everyone with just half a day! Please check this. - Stand in queue. The mango pickle is nice. - It's lemon, not mango. The beans curry is good. It's really tasty. - Enough? No! No! If he eats hot stuff, Swami will burn down under. It's not too spicy, Swami. Eat it. Didn't I say that I don't want it? - Then no need. Where was this lying? Didn't Mathayi have food? Mathayi is like a carpenter. When it's time for lunch, he'll start working. I will call him. Hey! Come and have lunch. Are you upset? I won't keep the broom near the gun again. Come. Come, soldier. Come on. Sir, the lunch was great, right? - Yes. Mathayi... - Yes. Everything is over. After eating, go and buy groceries. Just ask Anna. Don't forget to get the share from all the staff. That's enough! Well, you also sit. - No. I'll have later. That won't work here. Working together, eating from one plate. That's the policy here. Right, sir? Where are you looking at? I would've hit you if I hadn't put brakes. Hey! Now you got an idea about the whole thing, right? Pennamma! Collect all the stuff. I'll come by then. Finally you got one, huh Mathayi? The girl looks like a mango. Come! Come! Let me have a look. Come here, girl. Well... - What? Pennamma! Since he's stingy to give a feast, he got married without telling us. Come here, girl. Hey! I'll tell you something. This Mathayi wasn't really interested in marriage. Only if you show interest, you can give birth to babies every year. She's the new girl who has come to sweep and clean our bank. Sheesh! There it goes! Come, Pennamma. I knew it when I saw her. She has a servant's look. True. Anna.... - What? Go! Go! Anna, wait. What is this? They're saying all this because I'm still a bachelor. That's out of their love for me though. Hey! Your face has swollen up by crying. Wipe it off! Will anyone cry for all this? I cried just like that. Come here. Come! [Lottery ticket announcement] Drink this! Have it. Let everything cool down. Come here. I wanted to tell you something. What is it? Well... Don't tell anyone else that the gun doesn't have bullets! I'll feel embarrassed. Rameshan... - Yes. Don't you go to sing in troupes now? - No. Troupes are not active now. Now I sing devotional songs at the temple during the pilgrimage season. That's all. [Singing old Malayalam song 'Tharam Valkkannadi Nokki'] Rameshan! - Yes. [Singing old Malayalam song 'Tharam Valkkannadi Nokki'] Which movie? Who wrote and composed this song? 'Keli'. Kaithapram wrote this song I don't know if it's Johnson or Director Bharathan? Bharathan is the composer! You have lost your touch! Go! Go! To talk more about love, all of you can call us right away! Hey! Age no bar. So, sir is saying that there's no age bar. - What are you looking at? Any one can call. - Finish the work of that bill & send it. Call us right away. The number is 6660935. Please pick up! - This one, right? Hello, Vijay Sethupathi sir? Tell me. What's your name? I am Shreya. Shreya Sreeram. Shreya Sreeram! How are you? Are you in love? My match making ceremony is happening now at my house. I gave the groom a strong tea and escaped from there. Oh wow! Escaped after giving him coffee? Who's that gentleman who asked you to escape after giving coffee? His name is Varun. It's been 9 months since we met. That's all. - Just 9 months? Where is sir working? In the IT field. He works in Chennai. He has come to take me along. Why do you like Varun? He takes real good care of me. And he has a good job! Without talking to me, he doesn't go to office, nor does he sleep. Isn't that enough to love him? That's enough to love him. But, to live together lifelong, is that enough? Shreya Sreeram, are you still on the line? Yeah. - Okay. Have you discussed about your relationship with your parents? No. So your parents don't know about this. That's why they brought another proposal for you. So, you told this to Varun. He asked you to come, and you're going to meet him. Correct? Yes. Okay. Won't you parents accept this if you tell them? I don't know. You don't know? Say that you didn't try it. Sir... shouldn't we live with the person we love? Shreya Sreeram... As soon as you were born, they took you in their arms, kissed you... as you grew up through every stage in life, they watched you, admired you, celebrated you... and when it came to your marriage, 'Will he take care of my daughter better than me?' 'Will he protect her?' When they have such concerns and fears.... if you escape from your house, do you know how your parents would feel? Shreya... - Sir. Shreya, you both got drenched in the rain of love, right? You have confidence in your love, right? Now the decision is yours. Good luck. Best wishes. Hello, Vijay sir... This is Varun. Hi. What you said is correct, sir. This decision was too hasty. Right, dear? Best wishes, brother. - Thank you, sir. - Thanks a lot. According to me, how many ever problems crop up, how many ever years may pass, both of you should be one, like the rope that becomes tighter, as its twisted. With the same love! I love you both. And thanks. Vijay sir, I'm borrowing these words of yours. This is to all our listeners... There's only one condition to make your calls to this show. You should've blossomed flowers in love, hurt or isolated due to love, or should be waiting for death. Cut your hand? What is this, dear? Shouldn't you be careful? She cut her hand. She needs to concentrate, right? She doesn't do that! Look! She has bruised herself. Mathayi... - Yes. Go ahead, sir. Don't you want to go home? Let Anna come, sir. She's busy doing something there. Then you lock it and come. I'll wait downstairs. Sorry, Anna. - What is it, sir? Sorry. Mathayi... - Go, sir. This is rice & curry from lunch-time. Just heat it up. Babuchettan told me that you stay alone, Soldier. Now don't go home and take the trouble of cooking. The proposal is from a girl as beautiful as a white pumpkin. Come and meet her. She has come and seen you at the bank. If it's a white pumpkin, eat it before a Bandicoot attacks it. This party doesn't have any demands. I've been telling you for so long that I don't want to hear this. Those who are tall, healthy and glamourous, will be weak in this matter. Get lost! Get lost, I say! You get lost! If your problem is that you don't know the girl, there's a beautiful jasmine in our garden itself. Which jasmine? Anna. From what I heard, she was raised by a priest. She's an innocent orphan. That's best for you. It's profitable too. Two salaries. One vehicle. Just think about it. You ride the cycle, with her on the back... No. Make her sit in the front itself. Ride it... And then you can eat, sleep and work together. Just think about that whole scenario! - Great. If you go to the bank with a proposal for her, I'll be humiliated in front of others too. Now I'm getting good food at least. You want to get rid of that too? Get lost! What happened? - It didn't work. It's the same psychological problem of a cat that fell into hot water once. There's one way. Let's bring him. Whom? Love. Romance! 'Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge' (The lover will take the bride) - That's good Will it work? - Why not? He is an amazing lover! Look how glamourous he is! Mathayi... Come here. What is it? So, let's finalize that. Finalize what? - You're going to romance Anna. Yeah, right! As if she's ready to romance me! You don't worry about all that. Talk for yourself. My dear Vijayan, I don't know to romance. You get going! Why? Haven't you loved anyone earlier? If you ask me if I've loved anyone.... Long long back! Say it. Let's hear it. Come on, say it. I can't tell you about it. But I can show you. Look! Over there! That handsome Luca sir... is the first messenger of my love. So you were a real tiger, huh? You Romeo! Mathayi... - Yes. Isn't that the daughter of Chakkappan from Olassha? Tresya. Little Mathayi's little Tresya. Back then, if girls did something wrong, it was a fashion to stop their studies. Tresya's father was also very fashionable. I thought that love and romance had Tresya's little smiling face... until I saw her crying after being beaten by her family. Afsu, it's because I didn't have the strength to witness such a sight... that this Mathayi kicked out the love & romance that you spoke about, from my heart. Mathayi... - Yes. That lover is still alive in your heart. He is hiding. He will jump out some day. Wait and watch. He has already jumped out, Mapla. When that old lover jumped out, I saw the warm reaction he got. Hey! Whatever you lost, is going to come back. In Anna's form. That day, when Anna's hand got cut, I saw it. You were going to make stir fried vegetables by cutting your finger again? Why don't you be a little bit more careful? We are all class 4, dear. Gun and broom! So, we should take care of our hands & legs ourselves, right? Isn't it sad when the one who cooked the food, is not able to eat it? Here. Now you can eat it. This is my father. This is my mother. And the ball at the end? That's not me. It's full of Vitamins. Eat it. Long back, my mother used to make such rice balls for me. It was really tasty. I had seen it that day. When you made those rice balls for her, if tears rolled down her cheek, Mathayi, it's confirmed. She is also alone. Anna is a perfect match for you. Make up your mind, Mathayi. And then open your eyes and look at her. Then, you will be able to see the signs of her love. Keep your eyes wide open. Come on, boys. Mapla, shouldn't we finish this bottle? Leave it. We should fix this first. Wow! Moon is lying in here like an ice cube! Sir! This is the first time you're opening the bank or what? - No! No! Mathayi! I've been calling you for one hour. Well, where's your uniform? Can't you see people waiting there? Go fast. - Sir. Antony, Anna hasn't come today or what? True. - I'm already missing her Cardamom Tea. Babu, I didn't get tea yet. - That's why the messenger of God is informing you... Luca Mapla... Anna is on leave today. He is walking around all clueless, over here. If it doesn't open when you knock, Knock again and again, it will definitely open! What does love feel like? It's only when we don't see someone, that the energy and happiness they gave us, would be remembered by our heart. There will be a desire in our heart, to meet them as soon as possible. That desire would consume us. However beautiful the music might be... However beautiful the sights around may be... our eyes won't see them. Love.... That one word is enough. It is really powerful! You may be whomsoever in this world... But once you fall in love... That's it! Life will be full of surprises. Soldier! I didn't get a bus. I came on a boat till Cheriyakadavu. What is this? Can't you tell me if you'll be late? Now I was like... I mean, we got late to open the bank. Do you know that? What happened? Do you have fever? - No. You have temperature.. I'll be right back. Mapla, the festival has begun! Now there will be choir music, drum beats & fireworks! It will feel like nothing existed in this world until now. You'll enjoy the taste of your food like it's the first time, You'll breathe air as if it's the first time you're doing it. You will have all such feelings! This love... It will change you into a completely different person! Confirmed! Here. It's medicated coffee. Your fever will vanish. In that new world, you will start flying around, like a butterfly. Drink it. What is he saying in Tamil? Did you understand it? - You will start flying without wings. You will start flying without wings. We will talk a lot more about love. Be right back. This is your Vijay Sethupathi. Stay tuned! If they have to interact so closely in this situation, we should know why, Mathayi. He might be her prospective groom (cousin). Look at their eyes & noses! He must be her brother. Isn't it? O' merciful God, Bless this rose flower, for the atonement of our sins. Purify us with this water. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit... [Prayers continue] Who's that guy? We need to know who he is. Otherwise? - The lover will take the bride with him! That means? - Some random guy will go with the girl. Oh no! Take your hands off! Take your hands off. I can't see! You're yet to see the sights, you wicked Mathayi. - The cycle will fall off. Both you and I will fall into the canal! Take your hands off! Oh no! Save us! Mathayi, you'd have fallen into the canal now. Mathayi, we shouldn't repeat what happened in Tresya's case again. You must be really brave. That's the problem, dude! I'm still scared of the ladder next to the window in Tresya's house. Get down from that ladder. Anna is right in front of your eyes, right? I have butterflies in my stomach! - Wow! Wherever I look, I can see only Anna. I feel like she's standing all around me, little Mathayi. But where is she now? At the bar! - You rogue! You sent that girl to the bar now? She's on the cycle bar, dude. Look! Instead of stammering like old times, tell her the matter, Mathayi. I'm leaving then. Ride the cycle smoothly! This Mathayi has never desired for anything till date. I've never asked anyone for anything. I have only given. I have a desire for the first time! To take you to Vallamkari Church, tie a wedding chain on your neck, and take you to my house in the island. You and I... Where did he go? Why are you going in rounds here, Anna? Our soldier was roaming around here. Can't find him now. He must be in the bank. Is it? Then let me go and check. Since both of them have started going in rounds, things might proceed easily. Mathayi... So nice, right? Does it feel really good? Then, shall I show you a sight that doesn't feel good at all? Come. Look over there. Well, they are like siblings, right? Crap! They've been talking for half an hour now. Is this how a brother & sister stand together? Mathayi! He has started pulling the strings. Before a connection begins, go and tell her. Or else, that damn gun will be hanging on this side of yours, forever! Then what! What do I even tell this guy! Okay, brother. How old were you when you first fell in love? It's a love since my 7th grade. Her family found out only now. Her father has locked her up, sir. I know her. She might do something silly. Then... I will also... I don't know, sir. I understand... Poor boy! I feel sad for him. Tell me a way out of this! No! Let me listen! What sort of behaviour is this? Damn it! This is like pushing us into the river when there's an under-current. Hello sir? - Hello. Sir, can you hear me? Sir, love is like... naked babies. We can't say when they would jump to our shoulder or kiss us. Sir, the soldier is on the radio. Sir, who are you? You came in on your own, and you're talking yourself? You didn't even say your name! I am Mathayi, sir. I called hearing that boy's grief. Which Mathayi? In between all the Mathayis in the world, son of Kuzhimanamparambil Kunjannamma Kochousepp, Mathayi. My townsmen call me Marconi Mathayi, as well. Marconi Mathayi? The one who invented the radio? That Marconi? Oops! They call me that out of love, sir. I'm really fond of music. That's why. Correct. You are Marconi Mathayi, indeed. Tell me, Marconi Mathayi... Sir, what do we do if fathers act like this? Like movie villains! Mr. Villain! We have only life, right sir? Why do we need fights & arguments between that? We should just love everyone! That's how life is, sir. That's correct, sir. From the way you're speaking so much about love, I'm guessing that you're a great Romeo, Mathayi? Nothing like that, sir. Mathayi is innocent. Decent too. Hey sir! Love is also decent. Who said it's wrong? Right? - Yes. There's nothing wrong in being in love, Mathayi. From the way you talk, it's confirmed that you're in love. Tell me. Who's that angel of luck? Mathayi.... Are you shy? What is it, sir? Sir... Exploit this situation, man! No, sir. - Bloody idiot! I am in love with everything, sir. To the lake, crows, cats, you, your movies...Everything! I'm in love with everything in the world, sir. Mathayi... When I'm hearing what you say, I think I'm also like that. What is it, sir? I also like everyone. I really like you now. Can I get a hug? It's my duty time, sir. I'm all sweaty, sir. That's all right. One hug! Mathayi! Really happy, sir. - Tight hug! Mathayi! Thank you. - Okay, sir. Okay. Love you. [Festival announcement] Looks like an angel dressed in a red Sari, right? True. The tableau display is in progress. St. Sebastianos, pray for us! Hi dear... - Hi, sister... Mathayi, things will get complicated now. Why? Your sister & team! Look! Look! Didn't you recognize me? - Of course! Oh no! They have fireworks in their tongues! Go say something and adjust... How can I go? I have the bow with me. You go! Didn't you shoot the arrow? I'm tied up here! Look! Mathayi! Over here. - Okay. Go fast. Wait here itself. My dear sister, I... Mathayi, let's fix this girl. - Let me explain. Let me explain. Don't tell her anything. For God's sake! I... There she comes! I missed the last bus too! Oh no! So sad! - What do I do now? So what? You can go by boat. - True. Mathayi will take you, right? Why not? - You must do it. So both of you can go together... Hey! It is said that this eastern wind.... The eastern wind would bring fever. Here. Put this around your neck. Hey! I've been wanting to ask you something for a long time. What's inside that bag? Inside this bag? It's a medicine. - What medicine? Well.... If you have one ounce from it, half of our sorrows would be gone. If you have one more ounce, all sorrows will disappear. Then we'll be happy! If you have a third one... - If so? No! It's said that we should be tied up after three rounds. How were you able to call up that FM channel and talk to that sir like this? What's the point of us calling? The way that man talked to us? Isn't that the great thing! He... He is a great man! Oh no! It's gone! I'm scared of the dark! How can you be so easily scared? In every darkness, won't God show us a light? Look! Over there! I don't know! Anna... I like you, Anna. I want to take you to the Church, get married to you and live with you. That kind of liking. I'd like to live the rest of my life with you. This is what I wanted to tell you, Anna. Mathayi! Awesome! Let this be with me for some courage! Where are you going? What happened? What are you guarding in here? This is full of diamonds to guard, right? Go ahead, deposit it! He got me scared! Hey girl... I... - You? I... Well, I... Bring it on! I wanted to go to Idukki. So what? Why don't you ask for a leave? - That's enough. My younger sister Lalimol is over there, right? Lost that chance too! Convey my regards to your sister. Mathayi! - Yes. If I ask you something, will you say the truth? Were you actually in the army, or were you selling apples in Kashmir? Hey Mapla! Whenever I see her, I lose all the courage I have. That's why I asked you to tell me some way! Instead, if you mock me... Mathayi! Shall we make Lalimol ask her? That's correct. - Lalimol... My sister. Sheesh! It will be a disgrace. No! No! If so, I'll go and tell her. This is a silly case, right? If I see you in that area, I'll set your coir hair on fire! Then go say it on your own! Go! Go! Mathayi, son... Don't stay out in the cold. You'll lose the little courage you have. Hey! Shall I present it? I'll go and tell the Father as a marriage proposal. Official deal. That's good. This is your problem. It was a decent idea! Pour some water too. The water is running through the drainage. Go & get it! Give me one! It's said that we should be tied up after three rounds. Then you give me an idea! Mathayi! It's the best idea! We have been successful at it long back! Which one? Try to remember! Give me your hand! Got an idea! What idea is it? Say it! Come on, say it! I won't say it. - Then? I'll do it and show you! What is it, Mathayi? Can you give me one paper from your book, dear? Do you want a ruled paper or un-ruled paper? Well... Give me a ruled one. The letters needn't go slanted when I write. My dear darling... The apple of my eye! No need of all that! My sweethearts, my babe, my strawberry! 'The yellow flower that blossomed in my memory' O' yellow flower. Won't work? Then call her by name. Then you can touch her heart. For my dear Anna... This will be awesome! Oh! You are playing it here? Hey Mapla! It's late. It's time for the bank. Shouldn't we go? - Hey Babu! If things work out today, I'll sing on the street today. Is the song alone enough? - No. Then let's go! How come you're all energetic today? Yes! Yes! What are you doing with the gun? For some courage! Hey! There are only 30 Laddoos. Shall I get Jilebis too? Laddoo was better. Hey girl... Well... There's a lot of dust here. Get your broom and clean this area. I'll come now. I'll sweep it once this rice is boiled. Otherwise, lunch might get spoiled. Oops! It fell down! Coming! Okay. But make it fast! The broom! I'm coming! What happened? It will happen now. She's boiling. - What? Rice. - What's that got to do with this? She can sweep only after boiling the rice, right? Sweep what? Sweep this place clean. - What's this got to do with that? The broom is where the magic is! What magic? Babu! Who is it for? For Mathayi! Hello! This is Babu. Babuchetta, it's Lalimol. What's the status? Is she okay? Lalimol... The broom is where the magic is! Mathayi! Mathayi! Jesus! Mathayi... - Yes. You need to reach the treasury by 11 AM. Don't be late. No, sir. I'll leave at sharp 11 AM. I mean... Sorry. I'll start at 10.30 AM. At 10.30. Shall I get you a broom, sir? What for? If there's dusty, we can get it swept and cleaned up, right? But where's the dust here? There's no dust. Dust will come, right? Keep your cap properly. Okay, sir. Satheeshan, aren't you ready yet? Sir, didn't you say the funeral is at 12 PM? Why have you come so early? That's the funeral. This is the resurrection! What must have happened, Mapla? Vijayetta, okay! For Anna. Chechi, let me explain. - For Anna. I don't know how to say this. Still, for such a long time... So it's a love letter? - Give it to me, Chechi. Breaking news! All of you, please listen. One love and one love letter has been caught from our bank! Who wrote it, to whom? Don't go, stay here. Did you realize who our heroine is, now? Why are you so shy? Since it's shady business, we need no doubts as to who the hero is! Mr. Mathayi, whom you all are so fond of, is the hero! Why? Can't any of you believe it? Then you must believe it. Here's the proof! Mathayi sir... You're smart, man! Don't humiliate me, sir. - Is it? You can do this nonsense. And when people know it, it's humiliation? Aren't you ashamed? Leave me! Mathayi, what is this? This is all his acting, sir. This has been going on for a while in this bank now. He thinks that no one else knows about it. Soldier, it seems! Don't you have any shame? Did you actually do this? You've seen the world, right? Shouldn't you show at least the maturity of your age? This is like... If you had such a wish, should you be taking such a shady approach to it? I don't know anything, sir. You heard her? Since this girl doesn't have such feelings for you, This is like.. romance? It's quite cheap! Mathayi! I didn't expect this from you. True, sir. It was quite cheap. Losing easily while singing a song... That's what happened here. I don't know if it's love, sir. When this Mathayi looked around, everyone was with me. Mathayi was happy. But... I am alone, sir. It was wrong to have wished without asking you. It was wrong. A solace. That's all I intended. I made a mistake, sir. Please forgive it. Then... Life is made up of all such things, right sir? Right? Why are all of you looking at me? Swami, it's time for the bank to open. You sit there. Reena Ma'am, those people from the association will come now to repay the loan. Zubeida Ma'am, sit down. The chit fund people will come. Handle them. Babu, go and buy tea. I'll leave this door open. Sit! Sit! What happened? Is everything okay? Okay! - Triple okay! Play the drums! Awesome, man! What's that? Come! He is a soldier. He has travelled all over North India. You enquired all that, right? No one else that we don't know of... He doesn't have friends that we don't know of. We enquired over there too. Wherever he goes, he goes only after telling us. It's been so many days since he went missing, sir. Anyway we've made the investigation stronger. Let's see. Okay, sir. We've searched everywhere we can, for the past 6 days. No use! Has he gone to some relative's place? Mathayi doesn't have relatives whom I don't know of. Lalimol is going on calling every other minute. She's crying non-stop. Are you happy now that all of you ruined that guy's life? All this happened because he did something wrong! You're talking as if I sent him away on purpose. Hey! No! Enough of your help! Thanks! Keep that bunch too. You've come again! After giving hopes to that guy, and humiliating him in front of everyone, she has come again! You will suffer! Mathayi's curse will be upon your head! What wrong did he do? She's posing like a Saint! Pennamma, don't we know what kind of girl she is? You come here. Walk fast. So we heard many love stories, right? You're listening to Super hits Red FM Yuva, 'Shall I tell you a love story?' There will be a love that we keep in our heart without telling anyone, right? We often wish to confess that love, as well. Since we are sharing our experiences... By experiences, I mean our love, our pain, everything. To listen to that, as a dear friend, we have Vijay Sethupathi sir. - Dear... Pour some Sambar. Hello, welcome to Red FM Yuva, 'Shall I tell you a love story?' So who has called to 'Shall I tell you a love story?' Hello? - Did it get cut? Call. Call back. We shouldn't miss even one love story. Call back. - Okay. Pick up that phone! Tell me. What's your name? Anna. Anna, seems like you are in some kind of tension. Shall we do something? Keep that tension away! And then... just close your eyes! Think about the happiest incident in your life. Did you remember it? Now tell us what that incident was. We will listen to it. That huge courtyard of the Church... and the Mother who blesses those who pray to her, and we were the ones making brooms for them. One day, my grandma left me. Leaving me alone. Only Father Murikkel was there for me, thereafter. Then when I came to this bank, this also become like a home for me. No one saw me as a sweeper. Many people who were my own. I only knew God. When I came here, I saw someone like God too. The soldier. Someone who never hurts anyone, and prays for the well being of everyone. When I come to the bank every morning, he comes to me with a smiling face, calling me 'Hey girl'. The soldier. Even to call you, he was the one who gave me courage, sir. You know him, sir. The soldier. Is that so? Who is he? If you talk to him once, no one will forget him. So, who is that soldier? Mathayi. Mathayi? Our Marconi Mathayi? He's a superb human being! What problem do you have when he's with you? No, sir. That man who never hurt anyone.... I hurt him. What happened? Where is he now? I don't know. Please don't cry. He went away somewhere. Even after everyone searching for him everywhere, we don't know where he is, sir. I want the soldier back. I wish that he should be here always! Will you be able to bring him back? - Oops. Just tell him that Anna is asking for him. He'll come if you tell him. He likes you that much! Will you tell him? Will you? I need some water. Some water, please. Anna... Even if all of us in the world call him, that sound would be too less. But you call him with love. Whichever corner of this world he might be in, he will hear it. Mathayi will come looking for you. You call him! Call him with love and affection! Mathayi will come back for this Anna. To be frank, Rinu... When Vijay Sethupathi sir left our studio so emotionally, I felt really sad. Hello! We will search for Mathayi. While coming and going, and in the bus, we will look for him everywhere. We'll get back to you. A caller has joined us now. Super hits Red FM... We are getting so many calls now. Moving on to the first caller. I will also search for Mathayi, sir. I swear! This is my father. This is my mother. We're discussing about Anna & Mathayi's love story. In these days of ditching, such a romance? Awesome, Anna. We are with you! Hello sir, I am James. - That's what's on everyone's mind. What's your name? - I'm not Mathayi. sir. We should do whatever necessary to find him, sincerely. The entire Red FM team is in search of him. If we search together, we can find Mathayi. Mathayi... Anna.... I haven't met both of them in person. As far as I'm concerned, in life... there wouldn't be any human who hasn't felt love! What I have now, is just Mathayi's smiling photo. Mathayi and Anna should unite. I believe that all of you would help that cause. Mathayi, look there He's holding the gun! He'd never let go of the gun! Hello sir. My name is Angel. Tell me, Angel. We are in Kochi now, sir. Last week, we were in Goa. There, we had seen the Mathayi you're looking for. Are you sure? Yes. We came to know about this only after coming back here. And when we saw Mathayi's photo on our friend's Facebook accounts, we were sure. Are you sure that it's Mathayi? It's Mathayi, indeed sir. He is in Goa. Thank you. Thanks, Angel. Super, right? Dear... Mathayi might be a good person. Since he has left, he should decide himself to come back! How long will you wait for someone, who has no guarantee of coming back? All these commotions, will end soon. People will go behind the latest news. Finally, you will end up alone. Justin likes you. There are two ways in front of you. You yourself should decide which is the better path. My dear sister, do you know that Goa is a state? Rather than finding someone with just a photo here, it's easier to search for 50 paise at the Aluva ground. You hold this, sister. And then go back to that road, catch the first bus and go back home. Bye! Didn't you understand what I said? This is not our state. It's not safe to stay here like this. That's why I'm saying this. It's been two days, right? Nothing happened, right? That's all that's going to happen. That's why I'm asking you to leave, sister. Won't even listen! Then do one thing. Come with me, sister. Hop on! Why are you in tensed? Don't worry. I will find that Muthu before sunrise tomorrow. Which Muthu? That missing person. That's not Muthu. It's Mathayi. Yes. Mathayi. When I was a child, it was just like this. My dad left saying that he'll buy candy for me. And he disappeared! It's been 20 years now. We haven't found him till date. That's why, whenever I hear that someone's gone missing like this, I'll have a slight pain in my chest, sir. Don't worry. We will find Muthu, okay? Look carefully man. - We haven't seen him. Think once again. Okay! I will try to remember! Isn't this our Mathews? - Mathews? Not Mathews... Muthu Muthu...! Mathayi. - Is he here? - He was here. He was on duty here for 2 days when the security went home here. He is a good man. [Speaking in local language] I will call you Hey! They haven't seen him. But since it's such a matter, they said they will enquire. Let's search, then. Hey Britto! Don't you know Cleetus uncle from Matha studio? - Yes. Go and meet him. He goes around Goa all the time, right? You might get some idea. There's a guy called Cleetus who runs a studio here. Let's go and meet him. Sir, there are many companies that provide private security service in Goa alone. We went to all those places, but... Sir, we're trying all ways. Since it's Christmas after 2 days, people are all busy here. That's the problem. Hey Mathayi! Where are you, man? Abhi! Abhi! What? - Mathayi! Mathayi! Where? - Mathayi! Come! Come on! Mathayi! Where are you running off to? Where? Which one? That one? What is it? - Oops. Sorry sir. No problem. Don't you want to have dinner? Okay then. Sister, no need of any tension. We will find him. I will come early in the morning! Okay then! Drink it. It will cool you down. Shall we go? They are making us go in rounds! You ask them. There? - Yes. Brother... - One minute. Have you seen him? - No. I don't know him. Let's go! Did this Mathayi escape after cheating that girl? My dear Ikka, after listening to the whole Ramayana, don't ask me who Shiva is! This is not one of your fraud tricks, right? My dear Ikka, look at that girl's face. So graceful! Does she look like a fraud? If that's so, will I go behind this sacrificing my job for 2 days? Come here, dear. Dear... Wherever Mathayi is in Goa, Kunjalikka will find him & bring him before you. You don't have to worry, okay? Isn't that fine? - Yes. Boys, the name of the guy in the photo I just sent, is Mathayi. Mathews. Wherever you see him, tell him that his girl is here. If he does some mischief, beat him up and bring him here. Dear... This is Goa. If he's anywhere in this Goa, Kunjalikka will find him. And the good heart you had to come in search of him, alone.... God wouldn't ignore it. If I had searched for my father like I'm searching now... My father would have been at my house now, do you know that? Give it. Brother... Do you know him? Mathayi..!! Do you know him? - Mathayi... Where have you seen him? He just had tea from here, made a call, and left. Really? - Yes. Abhi! Abhi! Muthu! Muthu! Mathayi! Mathayi? - Yes. He just had tea here, made a call and left now. Is it? Brother, was it him? - Yes. Mathayi? - Mathayi. Brother, where is he now? - That I don't know. Leave it. Where does he stay? I don't know. Why? - Nothing. After he called, did anyone make any call from this phone? Who calls from this nowadays? Where has he come from? Let me redial. Local number. - Yes. So he's definitely in this locality itself. Yes. This is Mathew. He keeps coming here, sometimes. Whenever he comes, he brings lot of different things for our kids. Thank you, sister. Giving us lot of hopes, we are getting more and more information about Mathayi. That's a good sign. Day after tomorrow, my movie will release. 'Shall I tell you a love story?' I believe that you will support this film too. Thank you so much. I also wish that Mathayi will come fast from Goa and meet Anna soon. Next time I come to Kerala, I want to see Mathayi and Anna together. My prayers. I love you! Love you. Thank you. - Thank you, sir. You fool! Where is Mathayi in this? - Give it to me. I had seen him in this. Where did he go now? Isn't this Mathayi? At the back! - Where? - This one? We got the soldier! Give me the phone - We found him! Don't run! It's correct! Marty, which is this place? I'm not really sure, Ikka. This... Oh! Castle Cafe. Baga beach. Success, sir. We found the place Mathayi is staying at. We're on our way there. Super! Super! Just 10 minutes. Within 10 minutes, Mathayi will come on voice live. Okay! Okay! Go there and call me. Okay! - All right. You're listening to Superhits Red FM and this is the last episode of Red FM Yuva. Okay. We're on the last minute of the show. I'm also really excited like Abhi. I don't know why. I believe Mathayi would talk to us before this show ends. Mathayi... Come soon! Hold this. Not there. Should be over there. That's not a house. Let us go and check in that area. Come. There he goes again. Come here. Over here! Give that. Have they reached? They're saying that they've also seen Mathayi. But they don't know where he is now. Who? Malayalis? Brother, this Mathayi? Mathayi was here a few days back. But now he left. Why? Where did he go? Even he wouldn't know that. He's a bachelor, right? There were some gypsies who had come from Greece, over here. He would have gone wit them. Whenever I saw him, he used to hang out with those gypsies. Then he left with them! Once he joins them, don't look for him! Mathayi might have reached Europe by now! What is it, Ikka? Thank you. What did they say? - You tell her, Ikka. Dear... It was fine if he was in some other hell. We could have found him. These gypsies cannot be handled by us. We can't say where they come from, and where they go to! Dear... Don't waste your time waiting for him. He won't come, dear. Sir. We tried all ways, right? Now it's their fate. Should you be so stressed? What? Well, now... the conclusion? We need to finish the show, right? - Yes. Whatever happens... What should I do? - This side. Is it ready? Just now... RJ Renu who was with me in the show, asked me... 'We tried so much, right?' 'What more can we do?' I started this show with a lot of happiness, thinking that I'll listen to many love stories here. But Anna and Mathayi... They are really good human beings. But... I feel sad that we couldn't unite them, despite so many efforts from all of us. But, for their love... all of us stood united for so long, and put in all our efforts. Even though that makes me happy, I feel sad. Who's this Anna? Who's this Mathayi? Why should we do all this for them? Why should I do this? I didn't know that I would be so disturbed. With a lot of grief in my heart, Vijay Sethupathi. Tata, bye bye! Love you all. Thanks. Thanks. - Thank you, sir. Don't worry, sister. Let us search once more. No. What Father said is correct. The soldier would return only if he feels like it himself. Where else can we search now? The way you call me sister. I'd never forget that. Shall I go? Anna? We can only wish. What happens, is not in our hands. The one up there? It's all his game. Me... and the photo we were all searching with... Without any Mathayi's... and Anna's... love. Romance! Okay! Okay, this is Vijay Sethupathi signing off... Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, I love you! I love you! I love you all. I love you all! Mr. Mathayi... You look really smart, sir. Then, sir... You owe me a debt. With your permission... That pending hug? Why don't you give me a kiss? Mathayi sir... How can you run away from everyone without telling anyone? Correct? Anyway, I am happy now, sir. I'm a soldier, right sir? A colleague of mine from the army was in Goa. I was with him. And... this life... Life is how you live it, right sir? Correct, sir? - Yes. Come! I'm all sweaty...!! What do I say?
