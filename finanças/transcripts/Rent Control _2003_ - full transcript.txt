(MultiCom Jingle) (upbeat music) - Open call, buxom French maid. - Come on now, put that thing away. We already talked about this. We're not goin' on any auditions until we get settled. Come on. - Five foot eight Southern temptress. - Assuming you could play a temptress, you think they'll let you do a whole play standing on a phone book? - Somebody's cranky today. Oh, hi. - If it isn't the actors from Iowa. - Audrey, you look beautiful. - Thank you, darling. How's the apartment search going? - Great. - It's crappy. - Ollie, these are my neighbors, Holly and Calvin. - Nice to meet you. - How do you do? - He doesn't speak English. We're going to dinner at 21, and then we're going to see, um, what are we seeing? Look who I'm asking. Cirque de Soleil. - Sounds like French. - See ya later. Hey, cheer up. Life's too short to be unhappy. (cat meowing) - Oh, did I ever tell you about the time I auditioned as a waitress on General Hospital? - Uh, yeah, actually, yesterday we talked-- - They told me I was too meaty. That I had to lose 20 pounds. - Oh, Agatha, you really shouldn't take those. They're bad for your heart. - That's what the doctors tell you, because they don't want you to be as skinny as their little bitch wives. - Um, we were thinking, you've been so generous. We would like to help with the rent. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't think of it. What kind of an aunt would I be if I didn't take you in? Ooh, look at that face, that beautiful little face. You remind me of me when I was your age, only thinner. - Lana is pregnant again. Her husband, Billy Fred, just got promoted at the rendering plant, and the timing couldn't be better. Your brother Samuel just signed the lease for another 30 acres of bean-growing land. When you're done with your little New York adventure, he'll certainly have a place for you supervising the pickers. Mom. - I got that beat. Hey, cabbage-for-brains, this here manure ain't shovelin' itself, so why don't you come back and get to it? Dad. - Was our world ever really that small? - Aw, they just want what's best for us. - No, they want us to be exactly like them, and it ain't gonna happen. - It ain't gonna happen. - No, we're gonna be actors. - We're gonna be actors. - We're gonna make something of our lives. - Yes, we're gonna make something of our lives. - We're gonna take risks and think big. - We're gonna think big, and we're gonna-- (cat screeching) - Holy crap! We're gonna find an apartment. (lively music) - My first New York apartment was a loft in Chinatown. It was right above a cockfighting ring. I'd see these giant roosters going in and little McNuggets coming out. - Well, how did you find this place? - I cheated. I'm a building inspector for the city. One day, I was failing a landlord for 100-year-old pipes, and he offered me a deal. I overlooked the rust soup that passes for tap water, and he cuts me a break on my two bedroom. Or should I say our two bedroom? - You should. - Uh, Claire, it says here some minor chores are required. - Oh, I hate that word chores. It always makes me think of work. I'd really rather think of these jobs as pleasure. - Pleasure? - Yes, did you know that pleasure is very closely linked with pain? Just a fragile line waiting to be crossed. You didn't know that. Or did you? - Nine, please. What ya readin'? - Me? Oh, it's nothing. - Oh, The Temptation of Angel! I love this book! - Yeah, some lady, she lives here, and she left it in the elevator, and I was just hanging onto it for her. - Did you get to the part where her lover dies? - He what? - Nothing. - He jumped down the mine shaft, didn't he? - No, I mean, yes, but he's fine. He just breaks his fibula. - God, that is horrible. - Um, I'm Holly, and this is Calvin. - Hi, I'm Dennis. - Well, see ya around. - Okay. - [Calvin] Enjoy the book. - How are you feeling? Curiously itchy? - No. - (coughing) How about in the arms and legs, a little maybe? - No. - Can I get a lock of your hair? - No, stop it. - Okay. Who are you? - I'm Holly, who are you? - This is Vincent, the building manager. - And the son of the owner, so don't try to get me fired. - Okay then. - Honey, could you go in the kitchen and get Vincent his check so he can go? - Sure. Here you go. Cat's in the garbage again. - Ugh, Richie! I'm gonna ring your neck! - Can I have a lock of your hair? - Sorry, I don't have any to spare. Bye. - Freaky kids. - She pays less than a studio. How is that possible? - She's lived here over 40 years. Rent control is a beautiful thing. Don't worry. Tomorrow we'll find our own place. And everything will be fine. Nothing. Nothing. Frightening. - Come here. - Hi. What's wrong? - What's wrong? Well, no money, no apartment, no future. - Then you could use some good news. You see, I was at the gym this morning, doing pilates with my trainer Johan, and I overheard these two girls talking on the Stairmaster. One of them mentioned she had an audition today, open call. - What's the role? - Midwestern farm girl, five three. - Really? - I thought you'd feel that way, so while they were at the juice bar, I liberated their paper. - This is at three o'clock. I could still make it. We decided we're not going on any auditions until we get settled. - Go to the audition. - You think? - Yeah, have a good time. - You're not coming? - No, I gotta drop off these job applications. - But it's my first New York audition. I can't go alone. (upbeat music) This was a bad idea. I look terrible! - You look lovely. - I don't even have head shots. What am I doing here? - Lean over for me. It'll do. Remember, lean forward at least twice. Once to fix your shoe, once to borrow a pen. Make eye contact, gently bite your bottom lip, not your top, play with your hair. - Ungh, this isn't working for me. - Darling, this is the Big Apple. If you don't take a bite, someone else will. - Thank you, Chuck. Bye, Uncle Billy. Good luck. - I have to go. (Holly crying) - What happened? - Nothing! You scared me! - You're crying because I scared you? - Why are you in the hallway? - Nobody's home, I lost my key. Guess the audition went poorly? - What if I made a mistake? What if I don't belong here? What if my mother was right, and this is just my little adventure before I settle down in some bean field! And what happened to all the cats? - What was the first question again? - The cats? They're gone! - Who cares? - Usually you can't take a step around here without crushing something's paw! They're not there! - Well, maybe Agatha took 'em for a walk. - You don't take cats for a walk! Agatha! Agatha! Can you hear me? Agatha! Wake up! - I think she's dead. - Is she breathing? - Yeah, she's breathing, and she's dead. - No! No! Agatha! Wake up! - Don't, Hol, don't, you're only gonna make it worse. - How can I make dead worse? - She's ice cold. - Agatha, hold on, we're gonna get help! Where's the phone? Where's the goddamn phone? - In the bedroom. - I don't see it! - Look by the bed. What the hell? Let's say we call an ambulance. The whole building will find out she's dead, right? We'll be out on the street. How long after that till we're back in Pottsville? Well, I'm not goin' back to Pottsville. Not now! Not when I blew chunks at my only audition. You're not sold on the idea. You have concerns. Don't worry. We're not gonna hide her in the apartment for six months. I mean, there were two Weekend at Bernie's. No one wants another. - That's a relief. - We'll just sneak her out of the building, and take her to the hospital. - Excuse me? - We'll carry her in, tell 'em she died in the car, and then we just fill out some forms, call up my dad, and the rest writes itself. - What if someone asks about her? - She's on vacation. - What if the hospital reports it? - The only person they report it to is her next of kin, me. - I'm not goin' to prison over an apartment. - If we don't do this, then everything they said about us was true. We're just hicks on a little New York adventure, and that's all we'll ever be for the rest of our manure-shoveling, bean-picking, pathetic lives! If that's not prison, I don't know what is. - You don't think this is a little Jeffrey Dahmer? - We have to get her to the car without being seen. - Holly, you might try pushing. - Calvin, you can help me! - My knight in shining glasses. What happened to yu? You ran off so fast. - Oh, sorry. I had an emergency. - I figured. I followed the trail you left. You guys know Dennis? - Uh yes, sort of. - Last week, I lost my favorite ring. I threw it in the garbage by mistake, and Dennis went through the entire building's trash until he found it. - It was really no big deal, I swear. I mean, it was kinda smelly and dirty. - What's in the chest? - Just clothes. - Boy, Hol, we really gotta get goin'. - Okay, after one more kiss. Bye. See ya later. - See ya. Dennis, Dennis, we really gotta get going. - Okay. Going down? - Yes, thanks. You got some lipstick on your face. - I know. (trunk clattering) (Dennis screaming) - [Calvin] Come here. (Dennis screaming) - Dennis, this isn't what it looks like. - I changed my mind, Hol, I don't want the apartment any more. - We'll be fine, just as soon as Dennis calms down. What are you doing? - I'm holding his mouth so he doesn't scream. - His mouth, not his whole face! He can't breathe! - Oh. Sorry. (tape ripping) - Dennis, how are you feeling? - Are you hurt? (Dennis screaming) - You had to put the body there. - Well, I didn't think he was gonna wake up so soon. - We're trying to calm him down, not give him a stroke! - I'm sorry I'm not as versed as you in dead body etiquette. What? - Take the tape off. - No, he's gonna scream. - Dennis, if we take the tape off, do you promise not to scream? - Uh huh. (crying) - I know what this must look like. - You're gonna kill me. - We're not gonna kill you. - You're gonna put me in a box with Agatha. You don't have to, you don't have to, because I can keep secrets. My cousin Simon is gay, and I've kept that secret all this time. - Dennis, we're not-- - And the only reason that I even told you about this secret is because, I mean, I have secrets I don't tell. - Hey! Shh, we're not gonna hurt you, okay? - Then why am I tied up? - Because you're not calm. We'll untie you just as soon as you're calm. That's better, don't you think? - I guess. - And that's how she ended up on the elevator floor instead of at Mount Sinai. - You don't believe us. - It's the truth. - I believe you. I do, I believe you. You needed an apartment, right? Now, if you'll excuse me, I, um, I have some reading that I need to do. - Forget it. You're not going anywhere. - Why? - You're gonna call the police. - No, I won't. - Yeah. - Okay, okay, you're free to go. - I am? - Yeah, you know, we're all friends here. We know you'll do what's right. - [Dennis] I can leave? - Certainly. - Right now? - If you like. Oh, wait, let me just fix your tie. Audrey's always saying how handsome you look in a tie. - She, um, she said what? - Oh, no, that's wrong. What word did she use? Foxy. - That's right, you guys are friends with Audrey, aren't ya? - Friends? I've gotta tell Aud that. Okay, well, you're all set. Don't be a stranger. - Um, hey, what else does she say about me? - Who? - Audrey? - I don't know, things. But, well, you have to go. - No, no, I've um, I actually have some time. - Oh, well, yesterday, she said you look like a young Louis Gable. - Really? Who? - Louis Gable, you know, Clark Gable's younger brother. I mean, they looked exactly alike except Louis had glasses and bushy eyebrows. - Wow. - And that's just the beginning. I can't tell you this, I mean, Aud would kill me. - Go ahead. We're all friends here, right? Don't schedule that date for me until Thursday, because I want to buy this sport coat that I saw. It has this tie that came with it. Do you think this gap in my teeth should be fixed? It's really bothersome. Do you think it's too big? - You know what, we'll take care of Agatha first, then we'll deal with the Audrey setup, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - What if the janitor looks in the bin? - He won't. - How do you know? - He won't, and even if he does, she's in a sleeping bag, so Rico won't even know it. - Rico? ♫ I don't want to fight ♫ It's probably too late ♫ How we gonna get back to love ♫ - This is not easy for me. You know I have feelings for you. I'd never deny that, but Rico is no one woman's man. You understand? Don't give me that look. (doorbell buzzing) What you want? - Hi, Rico, it's Dennis, from the elevator? Look, we brought you trash. - Am I supposed to be happy? - Well-- - I'm supposed to jump like a toad 'cause you're bringing me trash? Tomorrow I bring you trash. I dump it on your head. Then I will be happy. Get out of my basement. Go! Out! - Should we? - Please, leave the trash. I love the trash. I want to kiss the trash. Where do I kiss it? I love the trash. I want to be with it. (gentle music) - Which one is ours? - None of 'em, ours was gray. - [Holly] Are you sure, I thought ours was blue. - [Calvin] Positive, it was gray. - Well, what's the difference? - You know the difference between blue and gray? - What's the difference between the gray ones and the blue ones? - There is no difference. They all come out into the alley. - Are you sure? - I'm posi. (furnace firing) - [Rico] What? What? - Rico, you remember the trash bin that we gave you? The one you were kissing? Well, we had something valuable in it. - It is available no more. - Uh, Hol? We got a problem. - Well, I'm open to suggestions. (organ music) - Though the nature of her death was tragic, I believe Agatha would rather we focus on her enjoyment of life, her intrepid spirit. That same spirit that led her to go white water rafting with her beloved niece Holly on that fateful day. Thank you for coming. Thank you so much. It was a good turnout, I think. Nice of the morticians to sit in. - I'm glad you could make it, Daddy. - Oh, honey. How you holding up, sweetheart? - Better, thanks. - Can we get you anything, Rose? - Maybe a glass of water. - A glass of water. - My sister never ceased to amaze me, but white water rafting, that takes the cake. - I'm so sorry. - Oh, don't be, dear. She died doing what she loved, I guess. I just hope they find her body soon. (crying) - They're gonna find it. No, Rose, they're gonna find it. - Gene! - We'll make it, Rose. We'll make it. Now, this is a copy of the death certificate. Now, you show it to the landlord when you cancel the lease. Rose already took everything of sentimental value, so any money you can get for the furniture, whatever, you keep. - Thank you. - Are you gonna call your mother one of these days? - The phone works two ways, Daddy. - You take care of her, okay? - I'll try, sir. It's not such an easy job. (gentle music) - This really works. - Cleaned out the fridge, top shelf, at least. - Dennis, you're the best. - Well, it's the least I could do considering I incinerated your aunt, and you're still hooking me up with Audrey, right? - Um, about that. - You are still hooking me up with Audrey, right? - Of course. We just, you know, well, uh, Calvin? - Did you guys know that Clark Gable has a website? - You don't say. - Yeah, he does. He's also got 26 fan clubs, a museum in Ohio and three tax deductible charitable foundations. - Oh. - The only thing he doesn't have is a bushy-eyebrowed, glasses-wearing brother named Louis! - It was Holly's idea. - Sorry. If it's any consolation, we still intend to stick to our end of the deal. - That's what I thought. Let's just be happy this whole thing's finished. - Serious Holly, playful Holly. - I think they're both great, but you realize we just spent two weeks salary, and we haven't even started work yet. - Playful Holly, serious Holly. (strings music) ♫ Summer nights in Sag Harbor Bay ♫ - Why are you still here? - We're staying in Agatha Washburn's apartment while she's on vacation. - Come again? - Well, Agatha went to Iowa to visit her sister Rose, so we're watching the place while she's gone. (laughing) - Why is that funny? - Agatha on vacation? The only time she leaves the apartment is to buy another cat. Come on, you better try and do better than that, all right? - Is this a tooth? - Yeah, it's an ancient Sumarian tiger tooth. - It's very attractive. - I don't wear it for the style. I wear it for the unholy evil that it unleashes. - When rent comes around, just come to me. I'll take care of everything. Are you coming, sweet potato? Bye, Vincent, nice slippers. - What the hell was that? - What was what? - All that come to me, I'll take care of everything? - Relax, I was just helping our cause. You're kinda cute when you're jealous. - I'm not jealous. I'm surprised. (sexy music) - Surprise. (knocking) - Goddamn it! - Take your pants off. I'll be right in to supervise the rest. Vincent. - Hey, I was in the neighborhood. - What can I do for you? - I wanted to know if maybe you wanted to swing by my apartment and see my cauldron. - I'd love to, but I can't. We're having a cocktail party, and I have to get dressed. - What time should I be here? - Oh, well, it's just a tiny thing, and we probably don't have another place setting, but you understand. - You redecorated. - Yeah, you like? - Oh, I like, country girl, I like. - Okay, well, I'll see you later. - Wait, I just. Ow. - Country girl? - What happened to all the cats? (lively music) ♫ Chasing down a rainbow ♫ Don't know where it's leading to ♫ - Good evening, my dear. ♫ Got to follow that rainbow ♫ To a place where dreams can come true ♫ (knocking) - Come in, it's open. - Am I too early? - No, man, you're right on time. Hope you don't have to use the restroom, though, the girls have been in there for over two hours! - Perfection takes time, darling. Look at you. You look so handsome and scholarly. - I brought pastries. - So you did. (throat clearing) Oh, I almost forgot. Attention, please, presenting the future Academy Award winner for Best Actress, the toast of New York, Los Angeles and the Iowa bean fields, Miss Holly Hewitt. - Holly who? (dreamy music) - What do you think? Do you like it? - You look so... Different. - I have a gift. - Dennis, you look so handsome. - I brought pastries. - So you did. (piano music) - Some more wine, my dear? No? You know, the moon on your pupils are like pearls on the ocean, even though your eyes are closed. Just a little? Just a little, come on. Pierce your lips. - No, me, no, thanks. - Dennis, you're not drinking? - No, I have a low tolerance. Or I have a no tolerance, really. I'm like a bubble boy. - Why Hewitt? - Because Holly Hepburn would raise eyebrows. So Dennis, tell us why you became an elevator boy. - Well, I'm just earning money, really, right now, while I go to school. I'm getting my master's at NYU. - Really, in what? - Speech pathology? - Why speech pathology? - Well, it's a long story, but when I was a kid, I had a lisp, a whistle and a stutter all at the same time, and when I spoke, it sounded like a junk band. - What? (coughing) (romantic music) ♫ Once the skies were always blue ♫ Somehow we made it through ♫ And you could rely ♫ On storm clouds passing by ♫ Yes, I remember when ♫ We were happy to pretend ♫ Good times would never end ♫ Together we would share ♫ For all in love is fair ♫ Yes, I remember where ♫ - It's picture time. Say cheese. - [Audrey] You're puttin' me on. - I kid you not. I never dated anyone other than Holly. We met each other in second grade, and then by third grade, we became friends. By sixth grade, we were datin', and 10th grade we were practically married. - I was married. - What? - Yeah, at 21, to my high school sweetheart. - Are you still? - No, no. I loved him, though. I even took a waitressing job to put him through law school. Then he dropped out and started drinking. Then one night, he decided to put my face through a plate-glass window, and that's when I decided, it's all about me. So I came to New York and started over. - Where are you from? - Why, Paducah, Kentucky, naturally. - [Holly] Calvin, where's that picture of you in Pirates of Penzance? - Which one? - [Holly] The one with the bulging crotch. - Oh. I'll be right back. Lookin' hard, huh? - Have a seat, darling, let's give the lovebirds some time alone. - I'm sorry about your face. - What do you think my mother would say if she could see me like this? - Probably that she hardly recognizes you. - I need a drink. ♫ I've got my rainbow wrapped around you ♫ My rainbow's wrapped around you ♫ My rainbow's wrapped around you ♫ You ♫ - Do you think Dennis is okay? - Yeah, he's fine. - Ugh, ugh. - I should get going. - I'll walk you to the door. - I love you, toilet bowl. You are my best friend. - Tell Holly I had a blast, okay? - Holly Washburn or Holly Hewitt? - People change, you can't stop that. - Yeah, well, what if I don't keep up? - You will. Good night. Cheer up. Life's too short to be unhappy. (lively music) (phone ringing) - Are you kidding? Bring it on. Oh, if it isn't the family shame. - Well, if it isn't, Peter. - Good one, and they call you the stupid offspring. - I need to look at the tenant files, okay? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, let me think about that for a second, uh, no. I have explicit instructions from your father not to let you touch anything. - Why? - Why, you ask, genius? Because you nearly got him thrown in jail! - See, that was an accident. - 20 dead rabbits on an altar is not an accident. However, it does make for a very interesting building inspection, and speaking of building inspections, tomorrow-- - I know, I'm taking care of it! - You think you can get rid of the bunnies by tomorrow? - Let me see the files! - Okay, what part of un-un don't you understand? Back off. - Okay, I see how this is going. - Oh do you? - Yeah, so let me tell you something. I got another trick up my sleeve. - I'm nervous. Thank God the freak is gone. - Let me see the files! - Get off of me, you mad cow. You Shamoo. You are a prehistoric primate. You are a retard. You uncouth man. You can't have it! - Get off me, bitch. Yah, ah! I thank you. See ya! - What, give me some ice! - How do I look? - Stuffed. - Open call, five foot three, blonde. This is it, Dennis. Oh, cheer up, you'll get her next time. - Holly, there's not gonna be a next time. Let's face it, I blew it. She's out of my league anyway. She deserves much more than me. She deserves him. - Hi, you look lovely, my dear. - As do you. - Oh, that must have been a strong martini. - My shift starts in an hour. I'm gonna leave now. - George, this is Holly, and that's Calvin in the adorable hat. - I'll have a coffee. - George is a producer. - Really? Well, I have to get going. Gonna be late for my audition. - You're an actress? - Yeah, I'm up for a small part in an off-Broadway play, southern temptress, but I don't think I have enough sex appeal. - Oh, I really don't think that's a problem. Why don't you call me. We'll have lunch, see what pans out. - I'd love that. - Aren't you late for your audition? - Yeah, I have to get going. - I should be running along as well. Let me walk you out. I'll page you. - Guess you don't want your coffee, huh? - So, what time do you get off work? - So how do you know George? - A friend set us up. - Can I ask you a personal question? - No, I'm not a prostitute. - That wasn't the question. Yeah, it was. - You see, the men I date, we have an understanding. I treat them well, they treat me well, everybody's happy. - You don't have a problem with that? - With what? Not having to work, custom-made dresses, nice apartment? You wanna see it? - This place is definitely nicer than Agatha's. - Thanks, a friend helped me out. Have a seat, country boy, I'm about to tell you the secret of New York. - Not there, that's a Gucci! It's very simple, get what you want, you enjoy it, and don't worry about the rest. See, I used to be like you. - How do you mean? - Selfless. I followed my husband around like you follow Holly. - I don't follow Holly. - If Holly didn't come to New York, would you have? What I'm saying is, you don't have to be a follower. You're in New York now. You can lead. - How? (gentle music) - This is not easy for me. You know I have feelings for you, I never denied that. But Rico... Rico is no one-woman's man. Maybe I give too much. It's my fault. Maybe we should spend some time apart, see other people. Why the long face? It's okay. - [Holly] I love New York! - [Dennis] Ow! I guess you got the job. - That's right! You're looking at sexy background girl number three! - That's great, congratulations. Ow! I really shouldn't. - Oh, one drink won't kill you. Oh, maybe it will. Calvin! Oh, Dennis, you should've seen me! I did everything right. I leaned forward twice, I kept my shoulders back, my boobs out, and I sucked in my stomach. - Was it an audition or a check-up? - I took my bite, Dennis, and I prevailed! I mean, this is a new era. This is the era of Holly Hewitt. Today, is, no that's not good. (mysterious music) (gentle music) There's no one here. There's something in her shirt. Well, go get it. - I'd rather not. - Ugh! - What is it, what is it? - No. - Is that? (knocking) - Calvin? Vincent. - And so it ends. - Vince, this really isn't a good time. - I'm terribly sorry. Tell me, when is it a good time to get evicted? - What are you? What is that? - Oh, you know, funny you should ask. You see, this is the original rental contract for Agatha Washburn for this apartment. There's her signature right there, do you see it? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Oh, that's-- - We see with our eyes. Take a look over here where it says next of kin. I don't have my glasses on, so could you tell me right here what exactly does it say? - Rose Washburn. - (gasps) Rose Washburn! Agatha's sister from Iowa. - You didn't uh? - Call her? No, no, no. How could I call her? That number, that's gotta be like 40 years old, right? I tell you what, the operator was quite helpful. Oh, God, Rose and I, we talked for a long time. We talked about the weather. We talked about how to poach an egg, but oh God, she said the funniest thing. You're never gonna believe this, about Agatha. - That she's dead? - Yeah, how did you guess? - Rose is crazy. Next time, ask her to put Liberace on the phone. - I might do that. In the meantime, get out! - You're making a big mistake. - You think so? How about getting Agatha out here, we'll clear the whole thing up, huh? - Um, hold on a sec. - [Dennis] No! No. - I'm begging you. Dennis, don't let me lose the apartment, not now. Not when things are going so well. - Sorry, life is full of disappointments. - Fine. - Fine. - If I don't do this, then everything they said about me was true. I'm just a hick on a little New York adventure. That's all I'll ever be. For the rest of my manure-shoveling, bean-picking, pathetic life. Don't send me back to Pottsville, Dennis. I'd rather go to prison. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Please, come in. - What the hell for? - I have to tell you something. Something you didn't know. - What, you think I'm an idiot? This some sort of trick? - No, no, no more tricks. It's time for the truth. - All right, but the door stays open. - Iced tea? Okay, Agatha's not dead. - Uh huh. - She only wants people to think she's dead. - And why would she want that? - Because of her, her state. A couple weeks ago, Agatha began to have problems, you know, health problems. It began with an itching in her arms and legs. - Really? - Yeah, and the itching got so bad, she was in constant pain. The doctors, they didn't know. (crying) I'm okay, I'm okay. About two days later, she lapsed into a coma, and when she came out the next day, she had these terrible tremors, and she had no feeling in her legs. Plus, her vision was eerily blurred. She's been bedridden ever since. - Bedridden? Where? - Coming? Agatha? Agatha, are you awake? Agatha? Hello, how you feelin'? Oh, okay, are your eyes still hurting you? I'll turn down the lights. There you go. That's better, huh? Who's he? Oh, he's the doctor. He's here for your checkup. Yeah, he's here for your checkup. Okay, okay, he'll go, he'll go. Okay. Yeah, oh, oh, love you too. Oh yeah, that's a good hug. Okay, all right. Okay, love you too. Okay, yeah. - What have I done? - All right, I'll be back, okay. We should go. - Yeah, I made a mistake. Oh my God, Agatha, watch your head! - Okay, okay, got ya there. Almost had a boo-boo. Okay, all right, there. Make sure you're all snug in there, there you go. Feel better? Okay. All right, yeah, you're okay. Oh, Calvin! Calvin, um, look who's up? Calvin! Calvin, Calvin. Oh, he does this all the time, low blood sugar. - Here, tea, it's presweetened. - Oh, thanks. Uh, Calvin, Calvin, honey. Wake up, wake up. Okay, there you go. - I could've sworn that I saw. Oh God. - No, Calvin. You okay? Okay, baby, sweet potato? Oh no. Is your head okay? Sweetie, come on. You're okay. Come on. Uh. - Hi, Vincent. - To Vincent, who so generously agreed to wait till tomorrow to call the police. To Dennis, who sacrificed his job, his tuition, to help a friend. And to Agatha, quite a sport. - If only I got here sooner. - You couldn't have known. - You don't understand. I should have been here. I should have come straight home. I shouldn't've... - You shouln't've, what? Why? - I was just trying to keep up. - I baked us some brownies, some comfort food, except when they're scalding your hands. What are you doing? - What difference does it make? I'm not gonna need these in Iowa. I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's just a job. - Not the job, for breaking my promise. I'm sorry about Audrey. - Forget it. I never had a chance anyway. (sad music) ♫ Lamore's quiet way of crying ♫ Is just to never be heard ♫ I'm standing here before you ♫ My lesson I have learned ♫ - What does he mean keep up? Keep up with who? I am the same person I've always been. ♫ I realize that I was wrong ♫ So wrong ♫ You were my everything ♫ - It's funny. After everything I've done, Calvin is the one that belongs here. He's the real New Yorker. - Well, in all fairness, you're probably both going to prison. ♫ My life is empty without your love ♫ - Why can't all guys be like you? - We drew straws, I lost. - You're smart, you're funny. You always touch your glasses when you're nervous, which is so cute. ♫ I know I've made mistakes ♫ Got lessons to learn ♫ And I will ♫ My promise was my faith ♫ It pushed you way too far ♫ Can I forgive you for what you've done ♫ I want to make you understand ♫ - This isn't who I am, Dennis. This isn't who I want to be. Maybe I'm changing too fast. Maybe I scared Calvin off! I can't lose him. Without Calvin, no success is worth anything. - Does he know that? Where are you goin'? - I don't know. - Can we talk? I'm not sophisticated. I'm not cosmopolitan or anything like that. I'm just a guy from Iowa. I can't explain to you why I did what I did. It's... It's so stupid. But um... I thought I was losing you. I felt like you didn't want me anymore. I need you to know that I'm still the same person that I was. I'm still terrified of failure. I'm still determined to help you succeed. I'm still in love with the same girl that I fell in love with when I was in second grade. (gentle music) I'm so sorry. I need you in my life. Holly, I'm beggin' you. You've gotta give me another chance. (soft jazz music) - Oh, look who's up. - What's goin' on? - Oh, our salvation, that's what. Dennis here has provided us with some interesting information. - Young Lasso ropes dead rabbits. I don't get it. - Yesterday, Vincent said he wouldn't call the police until today. Why? - Christian spirit? - Because today at four o'clock is the annual building inspection. Ow! And the last thing that Vincent wants is to end up in the newspaper again. - Have some coffee, the hicks are about to make a comeback. You okay? - Yeah. (light music) Iggy, Iggy, I need you to get up and work the door, okay? Inspector's coming, you got it? You got it, good. Iggy, Iggy, Iggy! The door, the inspector's coming? You got it? You all right? You got it? We're good? (tires squealing) - [Peter] Are you retarded? Go back to driver's training! Come on! - Hey, up yours! Watch the paint! (tires squealing) - Iggy, the door. Okay. - (sighing) Claire. Door. (fingers snapping) Get the door. - I got it, I got it. - Claire, this is Vincent. - Beautiful day, don't you think? - Painfully beautiful. - What are you doing here? - I'm your father's assistant. I go wherever he goes. - You mean? - Oh yes, he's coming to oversee the building inspection. Let's hope nothing goes horribly, horribly wrong. - [Driver] Here's your briefcase, sir. - Thank you, Kim. - Mr. Lasso, sir, everything's fine inside. No problems. - Where's the demon seed? - Oh, inside, sir. - Well, then we got ourselves a problem. - Thank you, sir. (coughing) - Hello, Father. - Well, that's what four DNA tests say. I ain't so sure myself. Is she your inspector? - Yes, sir. - How do, ma'am? Beautiful day, don't you think? Okay, kid, now's your chance to come clean. I ain't gonna find no surprises, right? - No, sir. - No little dead critters with candles stickin' out of their asses? No shrunken voodoo hall dick? - No, sir. - Good, 'cause if I do, you are cut off, and I ain't jokin' this time. - Okay. - Here, your mother baked you some cookies. Well, ma'am, time's a-wastin'. Let's get this show on the road. After you. (knocking) - Safety glass safe. - The sprinklers work too. I found that out by accident when, of course, that's neither here nor there. (elevator dings) - EG Manufacturing, very nice, very nice, very nice. - Well, it's a Lasso property, ma'am. We don't make 'em any other way. - And what's behind that restricted area? - That is the garbage room, and it is also the janitor's quarters. - Pardon me. Excuse me. - What the hell was that? - The janitor. - Wearing a cloak? - He's not from around here. - Yes, moving right along, serial number 821 15 89. (voices chanting) Do you hear something? - Hear something, no. - I hear something. - It's like a hum. - (laughing) The hum. Of course I hear the hum. Yeah, you can't miss it. I'll be right back. - Did you write down the hum? - Master, thank Zob you're here. (chanting) - What are you guys doing? You guys are evicted. Come on, get outta here. - Master, what's gotten into you? - [Claire] Mr. Lasso, is there a problem? - Just a minute! I'm serious, guys, all right. (knocking) I want you to grab the candles and your cadaver, and get the hell outta here. - We can't, we're in the middle of a spell that makes the building manager do whatever we want. - What is it that you want, huh? What is it? - Funny you should ask. Dennis wants his job back. - If it's not too much trouble, I'd like the job. - It's done, okay? What else? - We want you to agree not to evict us, call the police or pester us for at least three months. That'll give us time to find a new apartment. - I agree, that's plenty of time. - How do we know you'll keep your word? - Because I promised, what's the problem? - We need collateral. - (gasps) No! - Looks like we're not locked out after all. - Did you bring my checkbook? - Of course. - Fine, good, so we have a deal, right? So if we just get rid of the... - A little help. - With pleasure. - Thank God you're here! Somebody help. I was climbing on top of the bin, and I was reaching for the light bulb, and I musta lost my balance. - What light bulb? - The uh... Not light bulb, ceiling. I was reaching for the ah, ow! Oh my God, ow, oh, my knee, it must be broke! The agony! Urgh! - I don't understand. How could she just... - Can I help you? - Rico! Give me back my aunt right now! - If you have ants, maybe you need exterminators. - You got five seconds, Rico, to tell us where she is. - You know, you're sick. - You're sick. - No, you are sick. You need to see a doctor. - Give me back my aunt! - You know, I just woke up. I have no newspaper. Where is my news? Where is my news? - Make it quick. - No, no, no, no, no, no! - Okay, okay, okay. Okay, I take her. - [Holly] Where is she? - I take her because I love her. She's my ocean. I am her boat. Without my ocean, I cannot float. - That's disgusting. Tell us where she is. - Where she is where she wants to be. - What's that mean? - She wants to be where she wants to be, where you will never find her. She is where I put her. She is where you'll never, ever, ever find her. - She's in the incinerator. (screams) - [Dennis] Oh, that's wrong. - Get off me. Come on, this is ridiculous. Oh my, I do not get paid enough for this. Get off me. - All right, all right, let's check these water pipes. - And get out of the way. - Sorry, sir. - Idiot. - [Claire] Not bad. Oh, I don't know. I don't know. - Hey, psst. - So, did you get everything you wanted? - And then some. You were perfect, Claire. - How can we ever thank you? - Oh, thank me, thank you, dear, for sending me those lovely boarders. - I knew you'd love 'em. - All right, let's get this show on the road. I need to get home. I have a few chores to take care of. Excuse me, boys. - [Dennis] Ugh! (furnace firing) - No! Stop! No! No! Agatha! Agatha! Agatha. (dreamy music) - Midwestern farm girl exudes charm and innocence, I should go for this. - Ah, I don't know, keep readin'. - Jenny, 22, lives in rural Minnesota. Loves horses, men with pickup trucks and stands a healthy five foot eight. - Oh. Where's Dennis? (man struggling) - Are you sure you don't need some help with that? - No, no, I'm positive I got it. Where do you want it? - Right over there is good. You're reading Little Women? - Oh, this. Um, no, actually, this girl dropped it this morning. - Oh, and you're just holding it for her, right? - Right. Why, have you read this book before? - Yeah, like five times. - Really? - I'd read it again, I just, I have too much schoolwork. - You're in school. Um, what are you studying? - Speech therapy. I'm starting my master's at NYU next month. - That's great. That's great. Um. Well, okay. - Um, well, you don't have to go just yet, do you? - No, no, actually, I have some time. - How can you eat those? - Pork rinds are good for you. - [Audrey] One more kiss. (lips smacking) - Hey, good morning, tenants. Oh, today's the first of the month, so if you could drop off the rent check today, that'd be great, all right? - Okay. Yeah, we'll do that tonight. - Awesome. Hey, have either one of you seen Rico? - Rico, no, no, un huh. - I got my score from the inspection today. I got a C. - That's good. - Good? I shoulda gotten an A. How was I supposed to know incinerators have been illegal in Manhattan since 1980, huh? - Sorry. - Yeah, don't worry about it. Lucky for me, the thing wasn't even working. That retard Rico forgot to hook up the gas line. (laughing) That moron. - No. ♫ Chasing down that rainbow ♫ That's what we're gonna do ♫ - Still hot? I have AC up as far as she goes.
