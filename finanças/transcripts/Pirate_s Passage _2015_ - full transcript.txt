Watch! It's falling! Ahhh! We only found six. Yeah well, what're gonna do? He said there would be seven chests of treasure on board. We have to find the seventh. Here's the seventh. Skuddle her then. Skuddle her! She's done! Mercy. Please. Get yourself aboard. Your rum's here. Come on, move, lads. Let's move! Hurry it up. We'll all drown if you're not quick about it porky! I can't hold on for long jump in the lot of you! We stowed seven chests just as you said, sir. We didn't need to give him all seven we could have kept one chest for ourselves. And have 'em turn the British Navy after us? You want a rope 'round your neck do ya, Porky? James Hargreaves? Mother of God! Quiet now, lad. Captain Johnson! I'd heard tell you were back The town's in a tizzy. So say my men. What the devil was going on out at the point earlier? His men took a ship's treasure and. And drowned all aboard. I know I need you to show me just where they were. Will you do it? To night? When I've finished me chores I'll be quick as I can! The tide allows you in only twice a year. Otherwise it's a surge in under there. Struck the water when they were building the foundation of it. That's how he knew about it. There. Damn me I saw a formation like that once south of Krakatoa. Magical. Perfect I'll have to be quick to catch her. Catch her. Why? That's his ship. Aye, it is, and he runs it rough shod over our earth for his profit showing no concern for the plight of man. He needs a comeuppance, James, him up there, him and his ilk. There's no room for those pitiless gentlemen in this life, lad. They have their law I have mine. He'll pay for what he takes What is, is. Mark me what is, is! Skedaddle now. Thank you God be with you. Watch that horizon in an hour or two I'll light up the sky for you. An hour we'll be broadside of her. Prepare the men, Mr. Syce. Break loose the cannon We'll blanket her to port. At the water line. Aim to sink her. Sink her? Sink her. We'll let them see what a how do you do with Davy Jones is like aim to sink her. Ready ready! Fire fire! You sank 'em, Sir. Without mercy. You didn't hear their merciless talk, Mister Syce. Them's Seamen that don't belong in the Brotherhood of Pirates. They belong in Hell. Them and their wretched master up there. And I hope he saw it all. We'll not be back in Grey Rocks then. Heh... There'd be few who'd welcome us South, south west south, south west! Will this voyage of yours ever end, sir? I signed on for centuries, Mr. Syce. It's my god given task. Consider yourself lucky it's not yours. You're fond of that port, Mr. Syce. Aye, Captain, that I am. As am I, Mr. Syce. As am I. And it'll be a work of great passion when its time for me comes to pass but it's not calling me now. Not yet. In a century or two, m'thinks. When the wind with the name of Grey Rocks' on it brings me in there. Bye Mom. Bye Meg. Caw! Caw! Morning Jim. Good morning, Mr. Freelove! Mornin' Jim. Hi, uncle Robin. You're late for school. First bell hasn't gone yet. You going up home for breakfast? Cup of coffee, maybe. Mother's made pancakes. A milkshake for breakfast? It's supper, just finished my shift. Now you're late. See ya. This month, she won't make it. Can't make it Doesn't have the wherewithal. Then it'll be ours. You're just going to pour money into it. Then it'll pour money into me. My father doesn't think so. Your father's a Presbyterian minister. The most he knows about money is from a collection plate. That's going to be a Resort Hotel, Mona I'm going to turn this town in to a paradise. Everybody's going to come here I'll make a killing! Where's the dog? He follows Todd to school. Two topics, kids One. Nova Scotia and Confederation. Why do some Nova Scotian flags fly at half mast on Dominion Day July First? Why did the nova Scotian Assembly in 1868 - vote to withdraw from Confederation. - Stop it. And why has it never been rescinded? Or two Pirates in Nova Scotia Scourge or Saviors? I want a report on one of these two topics in two weeks. Five pages no! No, Master Hawkins? Really? No? You won't do the assignment? Is it because you've run out of ink? Clean it up. May I help Jim clean his desk up? Yes, indeed you may Todd? Yes, sir? You may clean up the floor. He's determined to take this place away from me Roy Moehner's a determined man. He's angling to get the whole town and from what I hear he might just get it if he plays his cards right Meg? Any coffee left? On the counter I'll get it. Did I say something to offend her? Heavens, no. It's because it's the morning and the girl's spent all night dreaming she's gadding about in Dublin or Paris or someplace fancy and she can't seem to manage to get herself back to Grey Rocks till around noon. Tell her next time she goes on a trip over there to take a lesson on how to make coffee. This is awful Robin Hawkins! Saw Jim. He seems cheerier not really. Seven years now Bill's gone and he suffers the loss of him like it was the day they told us. For Bill's sake we can't let roy moehner have this place. Can't... Why did you go and get yourself killed, Bill Hawkins? What's this poor woman to do without you? What in God's name am I going to do? I didn't know Nova Scotia wanted to withdraw from Canada. That's really dumb What'd they think we'd do? My grandmother says we're a shrimp on a plate of shrimps but we think we're a lobster. My dad was Canadian Navy. He got himself killed for Canada not for Nova Scotia. You're going to write your essay on separation? Yes. Sure. Better than on pirates. Pirates come from the sea. Them and the sea is what I'm writing about. You got the Howard Pyle book from the library? He did the drawings for Robin Hood I know. I gotta go do my chores. See you later, alligator. In a while, crocodile. Good dog, Grendel. Sic him! Oh no! AHH! Jim! Mrs. Oickle, let me stay a couple of minutes, please? The Moehner's dog is trying to kill me. Grendel? Grendel. Good dog. Go home. You hear me? Home now. That dog wouldn't hurt you. Yes, he would. Todd Moehner's trained him to attack me. Don't be silly Todd's just upset because he failed last year. You go home now, sweetie. Say hi to your mum Tell her you need new shoes. What's that all over them? Todd spilled ink on them. Ink? Yeah. Mom? Mrs. Oickle says to say hi. She said to tell you I need a new pair of shoes. She would, that one. She must want those fancy seamless stockings! Meg! Mom, did you know Nova Scotia wanted to get out of Confederation? Newfoundland, you mean. Nova Scotia. In 1868 I smell something burning. And it's not from the fire you were supposed to have had lit by now. Do your chores boy. People're coming I'm going to write an essay about pirates! Your dad had some books on them I got this one! It's extraordinary. Extraordinary? Howard Pyle! Lots of pictures! Whoa! Ah! Holy cow. A sailboat! In from off shore! Put your slicker on! There's a pirate at the helm! You've gone off your rocker, boy! You better get that essay done. Oh, no! Give us a hand, lad grab the line there James? Jim, sir Jim, is it? Damn me, trick o'the light. It's your eyes, lad you got the eyes of a boy I knew once upon a time. Thought I was seeing his ghost cause I see ghosts from time to time. Happens to fellows who sail alone at sea. You know much about ghosts, Jim? No, sir, not really sir. Get me warm upstairs and I'll introduce you to some of the ghosts I know. Yes, sir. Yes. Couple of centuries've been hard on her. Sir? The house up there. That's our inn. An inn, is it? Do you think they'll have a bed for a seafaring man? Yes, sir. And a meal? My mother's just cooking supper. Then give us a hand here and we'll. What fortuitous chance. Chance? Aye, lad, chance I'd set course for Boston and the storm blew me in here. What's this place called? Grey Rocks, sir. Grey Rocks is it? Lucky I wasn't on 'em, eh? I thought you were on 'em for sure Meg, this is. Captain Charles Johnson, Ma'am. Get in here out of the weather. The two of you'll freeze the house out. You're soaked through, Jimmy. He'll catch his death. Get yourself dry and changed, son. The Captain wants to rent a room I've got the cash to cover my stay. Get out of those wet things, boy the young lady's right Meg, is it? Yes. She's Meg And I'm Jim's mother Kerstin Hawkins. We'd be more than happy to have you stay. JIM!! Do you have a change of clothes? I'm a duck's back, Mrs. Hawkins. Since forever. If you could get my coat dry, that'd satisfy I'll warm my feet by the fire, if I may? Fire's gone out I can get it going for you. Fire... How'd you do that? I blew on it I know you blew on it! But how'd you do it? How'd you get it to light like that so fast? I work with the devil, Meg. He gives me a hand from time to time Robin. Tom Captain Charles Johnson. Tom Banks Robin Hawkins. You'll need to be seeing my papers. Not us, Customs. Before they'll give you permission to land. Damn. And I was just getting warm I've notified the authorities in Halifax and we're to confine you here at the inn 'til they come down Monday. This isn't a port of entry. Must leave everything on the boat Hawkins, is it? Corporal Hawkins you're Jim's father? His uncle. My husband's ship was torpedoed by a German U boat. All hands lost. Ma'am... That's the finest piece of sailing I've seen my whole life. The whole town's abuzz, Captain. Am I allowed in town for a hair cut? Bit embarrassed being here in this establishment looking like this. That can't do any harm. But only the necessaries off the boat. Til they inspect it. Hi, Jim. Hi, Uncle Robin. Mr. Banks. Who lit the fire? I did. My bones are ice. Do you gentlemen mind if I go back to it? No, sorry, go ahead. Sit a spell. You must be froze stiff. What's your line a'work, Mr. Banks? Tom. That's my shipyard out there. He's our harbour master It was his flare lit you up. Kerstin I have to get back to my rounds. And me to the Missus. She'll be wondering where I've got myself to I've been clear, Captain? You can go into town to get cleaned up but until Immigration permits, you aren't legally allowed to be ashore. Absolutely nothing'll be coming off the boat! Scout's honour I'll get supper on its way to you You must be starved. Famished, ma'am. And you? Your homework done? I was going to ask the Captain a question! Don't be a shilly shally. Go up and get it done Supper's nearly ready. Let me see if I can give a hand. He has to do it himself. Sit, lad. If your homework's algebra you're plumb out of luck. It's my essay. It's about pirates. Pirates is it? Modern ones or the ones from years gone by? There're modern ones? Aye, lad. They're the Capitalists. The profiteers and the tycoons that get called gentlemen but pirates is what actually they are. Oh, boy. Mr. Herkes's not gonna like that. Hmff... So which Pirates do you think your Mr. Herkes had in mind? The ones with the treasure the thieves! The thieves, is it? That's not much help to this old man, son 18th Century? Better. But if you don't mind we'll wait a while before we hand down judgments about who're the thieves. Yes, sir. Captain's dinner's ready, Jim. Go help your mother with the plates. - But I was. - Just going to help your mother with the plates. Could I trouble you for a rum? You'll be drinking a lot of rum? I hope so. But don't get that little red head of yours in a tizzy. It'll all be paid in full come Monday. Just mark it down. Oh, you watch it, you! My little red" head II take yours off in a flash! That'd be an Irish flash, would it? And no bamboozling that boy! Hear? I know the kind of man you are! I just bet you do. The rum, Miss... O'Leary O'Leary, is it? Meg O'Leary I think she's in love with me! Shepherd's Pie's perfect Mrs. Hawkins. Really hits the spot. Nothing like a good meal before you set off on a trip. You're going away? No! Please! Not me. You and me. The two of us'll be going. Oh. Maybe. If you eat your peas finish your food. Good rum? You never tasted it? Heh... No! You smoke? NO! Rum's really good You want a sip? No, thank you. Good decision. Life's made up of good and bad decisions. Try and make as many of 'em as you can good ones. You knew I was testing you? Testing me? To see if you were going to be a good enough man to be my ship mate. Your ship mate? Don't keep repeating what I say, son. Clean your plate I can teach you all you'll need to know about pirate life and death but you must understand that the sea's no silly matter. What we'll be doin'll be dangerous. You sure you want to take lessons from me? Yes, sir I'm serious, now! I'm serious, too. I want to know it all. My dad loved his pirate books. Alright, good. Then look into the fire. Look deep into it watch, Jim. Watch the flames dance. Look deep into them. See the sun on the water? Do you see the ship? Oh my gosh Pirates? We're in the year 1720 Sixty five, seventy man crew. Is that the Captain? Quartermaster. Elected by the crew So's the Captain. The two of them. Captain runs her in battle quartermaster the rest of the time. The Brotherhood of the Coast. Pirates had one of the very first democracies. You know what a democracy is, a true democracy? A government run by the people? For the people. All the people. That's real important. For all the people. Remember that. Everybody gets a share in the profit. Doesn't matter what your pedigree is nor your religion, nor color. Every one participates It's all laid down in a charter they wrote up. Rules of the Brotherhood. We'll get this all down on paper when we get back. It'll be your lesson to learn. Whoa. Rats are every where. You could never keep a ship dry below decks no matter how much brimstone and burning pitch you used. What if they'd found us? What is, is, Jim. What is, is! Are they burning their ship? Careening her. Beach her on a high tide and scrape off the barnacles. - It'll increase her speed. Give her. - jam! MUM?! Get to bed. But it's too early! You were sound asleep The two of you. Take the Captain up to room ♪2 and settle him in We'll work out my account in the morning. That be alright? Thank you. That'll be just fine. Sorry. Holy cow! We were in the Caribbean! With Pirates! On their boat! Gosh, we're lucky they didn't see us. But you have to be careful Next time, who knows? Maybe they will. Next time? You're repeating again. Sorry. Don't apologize just don't do it. Listen. Think. Respond Take your time. It'll speed up as you get used to the process. That's a rule. Understand? And mum's the word, alright? My life here depends on you keeping it a secret. Meg'll have me shipped out, if you don't. Yes, sir. Listen think respond! Remember everything you saw, smelt, heard. Democracy's for all the people Write it down. You go to school at what nine, tomorrow? Tomorrow's Saturday. No school. Ah. I'm going to need a hand with the boat. Can you do that and keep it to yourself? I'll pay you wages. You'll pay me?! Jim! Listen think respond Listen think respond! You don't have to pay me. A dollar a day. That sound fair? Holy cow. Number two. Such a fine old building. So many secrets, I bet. There were spies here Escaped Slaves from America. Tunnels in the basement. Tunnels? Really? My goodness Jim. This is the beginning of a very long voyage. You're going to have to keep all your sea changes to yourself. Can you do that? Scout's honour! Til the morning, Jim. Sleep tight. Don't let the fleas bite. Tunnels in the basement you say I know there are tunnels, lad and more than that I know the treasure chests that're hidin' in 'em! Here it is. You got it? Great. Yeah. Good, good. Hmm. Could I trouble you for a tea? Sit by the fire I'll bring you breakfast. Eggs? Porridge? Porridge, please. It's pounds sterling, ma'am. You can change it at the bank. We'll work out the details when you're. Captain, my wife Edwina. Ma'am. The town's here for b'fast, Meg! Everyone's come to see him. The lot of 'em are fools! He's a snake oil salesman can't you see? For me, Meg, please accommodate him Harry, this here's Captain Johnson Charles. Name's Charles. It's a right pleasure, Charles. We got a party line and we heard everything was said. Some years from now stangers'll be saying I was there when... You were looking to get your haircut Harry's the barber. Can I come in today? I'll fit you in. There'll be a crowd. - Saturday's my day and. - And they'll be thrilled to see you! Talk your ear off, they will. Where do you hail from, Captain? From the sea. From the sea, is it? You a pirate? Sorry? This here is pirate county Oak Island? Captain Kidd? Buried treasure? Local lore says if you asked a pirate where he was from he'd say from the sea. A pirate would, would he? There you are, young Jim. Take your breakfast with me Then we go to work. Fisherman go out early here, huh? Not these days. Not 'til dawn. Humph! Why? Was wide awake. About four. Sea'd calmed down Up'nd listening at the window. Couple of boats across the harbor. Dark as pitch, couldn't see anything. Funny talk, though Heard 'em clear as a bell. Pirates, maybe. Want to show Customs this when they come to inspect her Monday. Leaky board under there. Need her out of the water to see what's up with it. This is what they call a sea chest? Aye. And too big to leave in here. What's behind that iron door there? You can't take this off the boat? You're not supposed to. Them's their rules and all they are is rules for smugglers and the like which doesn't apply to us. So we'll obey 'em by not telling them. That grate's locked. You know where the key is? In the hall closet. There's a good lad. - Go grab it. - But. What they don't know won't hurt them. Not always, mind you but in this case yes, it won't hurt them I'll get the key for you if you show me what's in the trunk. What? You don't want to know what's in this trunk. You want me to break the law I have to know what I'm doing it for. That's a good lesson don't you think? Ah, Jim. Oh, my gosh! Careful Don't touch. Very fragile. How old are you? Are you who I think you are? Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh! Breathe, Jim. You're Captain Johnson The same one who wrote. Breathe, Jim. Yes, sir That's real? The Shakespeare Folio there? And the letters of Marque? They're yours? Breathe. It's not easy to breathe, Captain. It's not easy at all I better get the key. Customs mustn't see this! Not ever! Nobody must! This go up to the inn? Maybe. Don't know for sure. You don't know? A boy lives with tunnels and he doesn't know where they go? My grandfather said there were three tunnels. Said this one we're in goes way under the kitchen. There's a rusted shut door at the end there. We can't get it open. There's another tunnel above this that's used as our root cellar. It's the house's proper basement. And the third one? Strictly out of bounds I've never seen it. Listened to it, though Sounds filled with rushing water. That what you're looking for here? In Grey Rocks? These tunnels? A dollar a day might not be enough pay for you. The boy you took me for? James? He was here? When? 1717 Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Wow. Gosh! I warned you. Captain, when my father died I thought my life was over. Right now? I think it's just beginning! They'll be covered. You'll take me to the barber shop? Sure. Fire's out. Want me to build one? No, thank you. What are you doing? Captain's gonna get a hair cut. Would you like a cup of tea before you go, Captain? No, thank you, ma'am Just gonna wash my hands. C'mon, Jim. They're gettin' awful cozy... It's for his pirate essay Jim says he's teaching him things. There's something amiss there. I can smell it. Nobody listens but Roy Moehner's going to foreclose on the inn. He's refused our plea for a loan extension. He's a bastard! Oh... Your mother cry a lot? Nope. Must've been a bill. They can make her cry. That's why she didn't want a fire. Wood's an extra expense. We only have a fire Friday and Saturday nights. Damn it to hell for that I'm a landlubber now I'm frozen up at the inn there I'll buy the wood. Talk to her. See what she says. Humph! Inn's not paying its way? No, there's a guy in town Mr. Moehner. He holds our mortgage and he's trying to get the inn away from us. What's his real name? That's his real name. Meaner m o e h n e r. It looks like moaner but it's pronounced meaner. He runs the town He gets what he wants. You don't say. Wait. Those're the Moehners. Heel your dog! Good boy, Grendel! See you in the school yard, Jeem ee. That boy there's a bully Mark his shifty eyes, Jim. What? He's bullying you? All the time. With Grendel. Grendel? Grim and greedy Grendel? They named their dog after Grendel? That's its name Todd trained it to come after me. It's true! You saw. It's their dad that wants the inn. Dog's all part of his plot to get us outta there. If my father were alive this would've never ever happened. What about your Uncle Robin? He's a policeman. So? So unless it's illegal he does nothing. The talk in town is that the Moehner's are up to something illegal Just nobody knows what. So Uncle Robin says his hands are tied. So what? So nothing. Hmm... The intrigues of small towns. Life is not so complicated at sea, Jim. Huh... Never saw one of these before. You're who the storm blew in? Captain Charles Johnson I thought you weren't permitted to leave the inn. They said I could get my haircut. They did did they Little crawly things making a nest in there are they? Safe onward travels to you I am not going anywhere just yet. Hi Jim. Hi Jenny. Is she your girlfriend? She's my best friend. And a girl. You look like the picture of that Ernest Hemingway. He wrote about the sea in Life Magazine I saw you reading that magazine in there. Where I can get some firewood? Firewood? Jim! Listen think respond. The Hirtles sell it but if you don't pay them they'll set your boat on fire. Hirtles can be mean I'm starting to like this town. Your hat's too big for you now. It keeps my ears warm. Mr. Moehner, Miss Hamkins is here. How nice to see you, Kerstin. You can't lawfully take my inn away from me! Not if I make my mortgage payments and I have until the end of the month to do that I know the difficulties you're having The whole town knows. It would be so simple if you'd do as I ask and restructure my note. Company's rules won't let me. You make the rules, Roy Moehner. And the whole town knows that. And they all know if you sell I'll give you a very fair pricelf not I'll foreclose So sell it to me. Your Bill would want you to. That's the last thing my Bill would want you son of a bitch! The inn is not for sale. Not to you. Not now. Not ever! Captain, I'm sorry but we do not have fires here in the afternoon. So Jim told me But I've got a chill in my bones ma'am so I've hired the Hirtles to bring me some cordage. It'll be my wood but you're more than welcome to warm yourself by it if you want I told Jim to tell him that's not how you do things around here. The wind's changed. We're on a different tack now Right, Jim? Seems right to me, mum Meg, could I trouble you for a rum and a cup of hot water? Please put the kettle on, Meg. You met with Mr. Moehner? All my life I've believed the enemy to be the Moehners of this world. And I've dealt with them as such I will find a way to sink his ship ma'am. Believe me. He will not prevail. Meg's got my account Please mark the rum down on it Jim, we've got a lesson to study. Can I ask where we're going? Yes, you can. Heh heh... where are we going? Way back I'm going to teach you about Surprizals Write it down in your book s u r p r I z a l. Viking tactic Great pirates, the Vikings. Now look into the fire. Where are we? Straits a Dover. Middle of the eleventh century. England's over there. Normandy's there. Vikings called this the Northern Sea. Is this the boat they came to Canada in? It is. Five hundred years before Columbus. Pretty good sailors, huh? Look. There's your pirates. She'll point her stem into this one's aft port quarter and then on the crest of a wave they'll board us and the fight'll begin. They think we've got valuable cargo. We don't? Surprizal, Jim. Surprizal. See the lines dragging over the stern? Warps? To slow her down? This ship wants to be attacked See that covered cargo? That's not cargo! That's it. Surprizal! And there's no toilet close at hand which is too bad cause it's going to be brown pants time for those other fellows when they come aboard. Hear 'em? That's their god Odin they're calling out to. They're yelling for him to let them be in Valhalla when they die. They're killing each other! Yaah! Captain! What are you two up to? Spark from the fire. He jumped back Knocked over the chair Everything's fine. You cut yourself! No, I didn't. There's blood on your cheek. Must've nicked him with my nail when I tried to grab him damn I'll see to it. Supper's chowder, cheese Brussel sprouts and bread. Ghosts bleed? Appears so. That Viking saw you. Yeah! He was coming for me. Brown pants? Nearly. Not funny, Captain He was aiming to kill me! What was the point of all that? They got slaves out of it another boat. Destroyed the competition Just business Roy Moehner with a spear. Surprizal! You're gonna need it for Todd and Grendel and we're all going to need it for Mr. Moehner. After tonight it'll be easy! It's never easy. Big lesson that, Jim. It's never, ever easy! There's a tin whistle up by my bed. Will you get it for this old man? Old, yes. But you look good all things considered. They're doing good business, dad. Good? Yes but sadly all good things must come to an end, my son. Where is Klaus? I want you boys to do a little work for me tonight! That's Black Donald's March. That's not how it goes. So, how does it go then? Like this. Like this? Ah... better. You have a lovely voice. Yes, I do. Mind your manners, boys this here's a house of go go go guhd repu u ute! Can we not serve them? Have to, I think. I'll call Robin. Three beers, Mad Meg. Two beers. A ginger ale for you. But. They come here often? Never. Mr. Moehner must've seen the cars and told them to come and make it hard for us I propose a drink to this to this old, really old place and to you really really old people in here tonight. A drink to the future! Oh, I beg your pardon, Madame. We'll just drink these beers and enjoy the antiques sitting around. Wait a minute, where're you going? To check the lines on the boat. We checked them! You can't leave my mom alone here with them. What a good idea to wear tartan trousers. That the family tartan is it Mr. McLae? Don't you think the trousers make you look a little fruity? Robin says normally it's the barman who deals with this. Three of them against me? Why doesn't he just come over and stand there. That'd do it. He knows all we've we got here's a boy and useless old fart of a man who's run off at the first sign of trouble. My boat's busted her lines Who's a boat handler? Are you chaps fisherman? C'mon then, we'll get her back. Watch your feet Slippery as all get out. Help me bring her in enough so we can get a bow line on her. Can you find a coil of line to throw to that fellow there What's your name Klaus. To Klaus when he gets aboard. Going on board. Watch it! What the damn hell happened? Jesus Murphy! Hold onto the damn line. Sorry. Slipped. We'll be done in a minute Anybody found a line? I got one here. Give it to me quick. I'm freezing. Secure the line. Shut your trap or you'll be in the drink 'n you can't swim Carl Klaus, throw it to Jim. Oh! Get up off the deck, lad. She's fast. Let's get ourselves up to the inn 'fore we freeze I owe you all a beer for this. She'd a been on the rocks without you Jim, run see if your mum's got towels. Everybody listen! Give these boys a hand of applause They're heroes. So let me take you down to The Sou'wester and buy you the drink. You! Klaus, you better get yourself into some warm clothes first. Pneumonia's not what you want. Captain? You can't go! Oh, damn, Jim! You're right, I can't. Not 'til immigration clears me. A rain check, then, fellows? Alright? A drink when I'm landed? Get him home. Will do. And the young one I saw some pie on the tables there. Apple. Would you like a slice? With a piece of cheddar, yes please? And a rum? That'd warm me up a wee bit ma'am, thank you. Sit by the fire and I'll bring it. You didn't forget you couldn't go downtown, did you? Better coming from you than me though don't you think? I did think that It was a great pleasure saying it. You knew Todd was aiming to have me off the end of the dock. Hard for him to do it sitting down. Very. Lucky for the dog Todd didn't bring him. Dogs like that can't swim. They can't? Nope. Mass's too heavy. They drown if they get pushed in the water. An enemy's an enemy, Jim. What is, is and you have to be ever ready I am, sir. Did you set the safety line or you always keep it there? I set it. Pity my mother'll never know. Just you and me. Surprizal only works when you're a step ahead. Really something. I loved it. Loved what? The thought of eating your pie. Humph. Your boat safe? At least for tonight. The Hirtles might set it on fire Monday Meg sings in the church choir? Yes, sir Roy Moehner goes to Church? Front pew I think I'll go to church tomorrow. Get me another look at Mr. Moehner. Get me a good deep look into his eyes. Keepin' a weather eye out for that dog? She'd never mount an attack here. She'll wait for a chance to ambush. Evasion's your only tactic until you've made a plan of Surprizal. What do you think I showed you that Viking attack for? To teach me the Surprizal tactic. Why? To win the fight with the dog! So? So, It was all about killing I don't want to kill him! You don't? Gosh, no! He's a dog! He's your mortal enemy. Right. He is But he's still a dog! Lucky he's not a cow or a chicken! Then we'd kill him and eat him wouldn't we. Your enemy's your enemy and you're gonna have to fight him but you need battle plans. One for the dog. One for Todd. Two fronts. You have to be ready. You don't have to kill 'em you just have to win I know. I'm figuring it out. Surprizal's going to show me a way. Okay. Coast's clear. Here come the Moehners. Thank you. Your boy Klaus alright? Just barely. Freezing cold he was. Because he went into the bay to save my boat I'm very grateful. That was what it was? He's alive not here at church but he's alive. Your boat set to sail off, is she? I figure I'll stay a while The inn's a lovely old place. A complete wreck but lovely. I'll renovate it. Waiting for his mother to come to terms with what's best for her and this grand lad of hers. We'll have enough money to pay you off just as soon as the Captain's immigration papers clear! Is that so? Need to pay my bill, that's all. Amen to paying bills. You and your big mouth. Moehner'll be on the phone with Immigration in the morning and they'll go over my Merry with a fine tooth comb. - Sorry. The look on his face just. - Natural reaction but natural reactions can get you killed sometimes. Remember you always have to Listen think respond. This's quite a car 1950 Olsmobile 98. They say it's the only one like it in Canada. Must feel lonely all by itself up here. That'll be Meg... An angel. Go into church I've seen his eyes I'll be at the boat after. How's she look? Bristol? Bristol? She looks alright to me. Good. Let's put her to bed I wanna see where that goes. We can't let Mother know. That where Roy Moehner lives? That's right. He's watching us Right now. You can see him? Sun's glinting off his binoculars. What's that building over there? That's Mr. Moehner's warehouse. And the boats at the dock there? Klaus's. Mr. Moehner's Why? Them's what I heard the first night. Their voices. Their talk. It came across water like they were whispering in my ear I'll bet they're trafficking contraband. You think they are? I figure maybe Roy's the French word for king. Did'ja know that? Do you know what happened to French king? People got fed up and cut the Roi's head off. We're fed up! So it'll be off with Roy's head. You ready? We'll go to 1719. It's the golden age of piracy. You ready to go there? Now? If we're going to cut off the King's head we better get prepared I'm ready. Scared, but ready. It's good to be a little scared but if we're to save this inn we're going to have a real fight so we should see how the pirates fight. Ready when you are, Captain. Good. Into those flames we go a sail! A sail! Fair by us. Eastward two points upon her weather bow. Set the compass. Who's that? Calico Jack and his wife the pirate, Anne Bonney. Gosh. She's beautiful she's changing course heading south east chase! What's happening? Lookout's seen a sail Heading towards the Spanish Main. Mon Capitaine! C'est vraiment vous? Vous etes avec nous? Sure am, Pierre. They speak French? Some of 'em. Sure they do capitaine johnson est avec nous! This is my friend, Jim Hawkins. Never been in a chase before. You're good luck, Jim. It's a great day when the Captain's with us. You long out of port, Jack? Sixteen days We need to bring something back. Will we board and fight, sir? I hope not. Come quiet Show the black flag not the red nose into their quarter and hope they'll give up. Don't want their ship. Just the cargo. People like living bring up the small arms! Glad to have you with the Captain young master Hawkins. Sling the yards in chain? Fore and main and the crossjack. Can I do anything? Watch and learn. A lot of preparation for battle. See if any of it applies to our Mr. Moehner. To a short fight, men. To great profit and a safe trip home God save us all! Hurrah! Augh! You said rum was good. Yuck! Raise our colours! Fly the black flag! Calico Jack designed this flag. The skull and crossed swords. Everyone uses it now. It was his. Look! Be ready, Jim I'm ready, Captain. AH! I'm alright! You fools! Find cover! Musketman! Ready. Aim fire! Musketmen! Ready. Aim we surrender! We surrender! Drop all your arms on deck and prepare for boarding. Grappling arms! Call your men from above One shot and we destroy you all Jim... Jim. The two of you! My goodness I leave you alone for two seconds and into dream land you go. Bring those dishes over here, Jimmy and then get up to bed Your work all down? She's ruined everything. We'll go back tomorrow. Too late. The chase'll be done! It's a shooting star, lad and they're never done, are they? She'll be there for us tomorrow. Right where we left off. What is, is. It's that simple. Concentrate. Remember exactly what you saw. Would you like a rum, Captain? A tea, please? And some toast? Prepare? I know what I saw. Preparation. Thorough, detailed preparation. And preparation's what we'll need to take down Roy Moehner. And Grendel. Are you going to die? I don't think so. Good. Go help your mum. It's all going to be fine. Trust me. He's a great lad, your boy. We'll have a fight with Mr. Moehner and his dog but this is a fight I know how to win and your son is learning very fast. It'll be a battle royale! Lots'a fireworks! It's Monday and these officers are here to clear you into Canada. Oh, good. Good How do you do? Fine, thank you, sir Have you carried anything at all ashore? Uh, s s sorry? Have you brought anything ashore? Toothbrush. Clothes to dry out That sort of thing. If you want to look come, the room's upstairs. Captain Johnson? Stay here, please. They don't want to see my room? Just your papers. My papers? They're on the bar there. Oh damn. In my pocket. Silly. Bad night. Get 'em now and then. How long do you plan to stay? The old girl's gotta come out of the water. Planks need to be looked at 'fore she's safe to put out to sea and the engine's down. When do you plan to leave? Uhm, spring? You can support yourself? Going to go to the bank as soon as you give me permission. Welcome to Canada. Close to a hundred a month once you count his rum. And he's given a month's security. Unheard of. We got enough? With some to spare. You want me to come with you? I'll be fine. Just fine. Count it! Give me my receipt. He's the slimiest man in the world He smiles I want to throw up. Roy's not going to go away easily. Someone's called Immigration complaining they were too easy on the Captain They're coming back! Roy Moehner! If Immigration takes his permit Roy figures you'll take back your money and leave. Hah! He's aiming to dismast us. What are we going to do? What can we do? Prepare. Prepare Prepare how? For what? Prepare for battle. Plan an attack. We surprise our Mr. Roy Moehner. It's a Pirate trick, mum They call it Surprizal! He won't expect us to attack so we will! We're going to attack Roy Moehner? We shall, Mrs. Hawkins. Roy's run of luck may come to its end today. All endeavors legal, of course. Where'd he get that car from? I don't know. Why? It's not one that's sold in Canada. Then how come he has it? Have you ever seen inside his warehouse Seen what's in it? The one on the point no? Why? He's just curious, that's all. Are you sure that car's not sold in Canada? Dead sure. Only in America. Must've been brought in somehow. Really. You're smiling I am, Kerstin. For sure, I am Jim, you know what to do? With the car? Yes. Don't get caught! Be nice to them when they come. They'll be wrapped around it. We're all set then? Captain? Good luck to all of us. You forget something, gentlemen? We have a few more questions we'd like to ask Captain Johnson, Ma'am. Please let him know we've arrived. We'll wait for him by his boat. When the winds calm down, Shirley Robert I was sailing from England. Oh! England's so beautiful this time of year. The air has a crisp. Captain, you're getting sidetracked again. Some days are better than others, I'm afraid I was on a port tack when I was caught in the storm. Extraordinary storm. Quite a challenge for a single hander. - The tiller was nearly pulled. - Captain Johnson please focus. Where was your I thought you gentleman might be in need of something wet and warm. Captain, are these two ruffians treating you unkindly? If they are, tell me and I'll get involved. Sorry for bothering you again about Captain Johnson. And thanks for warming us up Miss o'leary. Quite wonderful. Why don't you two come in for a bite to eat with Kerstin and me. Now? We'd love to, ma'am! Thank you. Truth be told, we're starving Shirley still inside? Yup, and Roy Moehner's up there too. Tire's flat. Good. May we have the key, please Shirley? Oh... Ma'am, what is, is... Oh my I'll hold the key, Robin Jim and I'll stand guard until you come back. Shirley'll stay here with us. Hello, Robin. - I have a flat tire. I wonder if you. - Mister Roy Moehner? Yes? How did you get that car that Oldsmobile 98 into the country? Newfoundland. A boat of mine brought it here when they joined Confederation. Did you think that was legal? My lawyer assured me it was. Lawyers advise, the choice is yours. What's in that warehouse on the point? Commercial goods. Let's go have a look then I I I don't have a key. We do. You thought you could dismast us didn't you, Mister Gentleman? I have no idea what you're talking about Now just get out of my way. You going swimming? What the hell! We just blew your ship out of the water, mister and you don't even know it sank, do you. Well, you're about to find out! Surprizal! Mr. Moehner please be advised that we are arresting you on charges of the illegal importation of contraband goods with further charges pending surprizal! Mr. Roy Moehner. What are you doing? They're taking you to Halifax I need to speak to my wife. Kerstin will call her. He'd been smuggling everything fancy in for his resort. The inn. Which means what? Jail. He's got enough illegal booze to keep an army drunk for years. And our mortgage? This seems proof of extortion. He was a conniving cheat, a rat. Well, now that that's done all the inn needs is money! We'll get it. Don't be a shilly shally. What a day. There's still Grendel and Todd I'm working on a plan But for tomorrow. Will we go back to Calico Jack? We will, but tonight you need to write your paper and I need more rum. Upstairs, now. You don't burn yourself, either? No. But you can't fly, can you? No. No, I can't fly. But I'll tell you what I can do I can get damn cold. Stop doing that, Todd. You got my dad arrested I'm warning you, Todd. Nyaaa! You gonna cry on me? No, I'm not going to cry on you I'm gonna kill your dog. You'd really kill Grendel? If it turned into a fight to the death, sure but that's not how it's going to happen with a dog. Hurry up, Jenny. We'll be late. How many pages is this? Eleven I asked for five. It's a big subject. Did you do this? Yessir. Last time I asked you, you said you didn't even have a paint set I bought one I've a part time job brand hurry it up. We'll all drown if you're not quick about it. Porky! I can't hold on for long. Struck the water building the foundation of it. That's how I know about it It opens up just twice a year. Then the surge won't let you in. Saw a formation like that south of Krakatoa once. Magical. Perfect captain! Jim? I got an A+. An A+ and that was just on the first part. Mr. Herkes let me have till after Christmas to finish it but he's given me an A+ on what I've done so far. Here. Where's the Captain? Down in the basement. Jim this is wonderful. In the basement? Why? He's going to write up a history of the place for the travel brochure that he's going to get printed. He said you start from the bottom up so that's where he is. Down there I'm going to tell him my mark captain johnson! Captain Johnson? Coming, Jim. Hold on. I'm coming captain!

What with what we have to do with the inn with my boat, with the Moehners. More work on your essay I expect I'll be here for... for ages. Do you think there's anymore treasure down there? I expect we'll have to find out, won't we
