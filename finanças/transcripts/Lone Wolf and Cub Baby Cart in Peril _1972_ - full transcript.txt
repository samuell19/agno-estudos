You put in ink as you make cuts. We call this pricking sound tohibiki or "distant echo." It's a sweet sound for pros. Others say it gives them chills and goose bumps. Talk about chills, though. Because of the ink in the tattoo, you feel twice as cold in winter. You need to wear cotton-padded clothes. Lt doesn't mean, though, it cools you down in summer. Carrying a tattoo means a lifetime of patience. What a fine woman she was. I've never inked such skin before or since. When we tattoo artists say "a fine woman," it's all about her skin. She had such a fine figure, though, men would want to jump on her. She must have had an exceptionally beautiful face, too. Was she hiding her face? Yes. She stood straight up right where you are. She didn't care what it was. Something surprising. She wanted tattoos to knock the wind out of people. It could be something so horrible and grotesque that it would make your heart stop. or it could be something to drive men insane with lust. She asked me not to hold back. She wanted something on both her front and back. on her back, I tattooed the Mountain Hag Devil, Yamanba and on her chest, the baby Kintaro fondling her. Anyone would scream when I work from her breasts to her belly. The pain runs from the tip of the toes to the core of the head. A sharp, stabbing pain. However, she was a staggeringly strong woman. She didn't even moan, not once. Then I noticed something. At first, I thought she was a dancer. But, no. She had clearly been trained with the sword. I hear daimyo lords take on besshiki-me or "sword mistresses." Based on her looks and her shape, I had a feeling she was one of those sword mistresses. Maybe that was why she didn't show her face. Anyway, she must've been from a samurai family. Yet she now had two tattoos, a monster on her back and a fondling baby on her front, to carry for the rest of her life. TATTOO BY UNO I wonder what the idea was. For me, Unokichi the Tattoo Artist, it's the masterpiece of a lifetime. But I've been worried, even to this day, it might bring bad luck. Who could you be? Could you be the God of Luck? Who, who, who comes next? Dark in complexion and short in height -He he he -Ha ha ha Who could you be? Could you be the God of Wealth? Who comes after that? A long head and ample cheeks He he he Who could you be? Could you be the God of Happy Long Life? Who comes after that? Could you be the round-bellied God of Prosperity? Who comes after that? The one with a runny nose? Who could you be? Could you be the God of Longevity? Happy day, sir. Go home now, boys. The show is over. Go home. Daigoro? Daigoro. Are you two beauties the Goddesses of Fortune? -Look. -Huh? Oops. Come on, son, we're going home. The fun is over. Go home. It'll get dark. Scary monsters are coming. Go home. COLD NIGHT PRAYER Papa! Pitter patter, the rain is falling Ln a sad and cold rain His young heart is freezing Waiting for his papa who's not coming home His papa is an assassin, they say His father often spent a night in an old temple. The boy knew this very well. He also knew, after completing an assassination mission, his father would invariably sit before the Buddha. Why did his father head for an old temple? To talk with the child's mother in the nether world? To soothe his heart in the unblemished air? The boy didn't know why. Yet he searched for his father on the ancient temple grounds. Those eyes... When a swordsman puts himself between life and death and becomes one with nothingness, he attains "Death Life Eyes." The eyes belong only to those who have survived death and carnage multiple times. No way a little child can have such eyes. Have my eyes been failing me? Be careful which way the wind blows! Okay! -We'll have good rice fields next year. -Surely. -Setting fire! -Fire! Don't get surrounded by fire! He'll be surrounded by fire. I can't just watch it. Yet what a rare chance to test his "Death Life Eyes"? Lt appears my eyes were not failing me. He's surrounded by fire, yet he doesn't call for help or scream. Young as he is, he has accepted he can't escape, and he remains calm. How terrifying his resolve is! What a strange child I met. -Nice fire, wasn't it? -Finally it's over. -Well done. -We'll have a great year. Everybody, come here! What's wrong? It's a child! He was caught in the fire. He needs treatment. Stop. That child? He got caught in the fire and dug himself into the mud. He must be treated. He dug himself into the mud to survive? Yes, what a lucky child. He knew he could save himself. That's why he didn't call for help and wasn't even afraid. Put him down. What are you doing? Why do you point your sword at an innocent child? It's his eyes. His eyes belong only to those who have killed hundreds of men and withstood the splatter of their blood. His Death Life Eyes. It's incomprehensible. Lt can't be true. His eyes betray no fear when confronted with a sword. Anyone who pursues swordsmanship strives to attain such a spiritual state regarding life and death. His Death Life Eyes. What are you doing? I must test him. -Test him? -I'll kill him. How can you? Step aside, or I'll kill you too. Suio-ryu Horse-Slayer! Could you be Ogami's child? Papa! Itto Ogami. Papa! You're Gunbei Yagyu, aren't you? I suspected you were alive. I defeated you. My Yagyu New Kage-ryu swordsmanship thoroughly defeated your Suio-ryu. Yet you were appointed Shogunate Executioner. At that time... The Tokugawa Shogunate took an iron-fisted approach in controlling the daimyo lords with their Han domains within Japan. Any sign of disagreement could cost a lord his title and his family land. The Kogi Kaishakunin, the Shogunate Executioner, was tasked to be the condemned lords' second in their seppuku self-execution and their final decapitator. The Shogunate granted the Executioner the right to wear the Hollyhock Crest. Thus it was demonstrated to the public that it was the Shogunate that was performing the decapitation. Fool! Get me Gunbei. Every second counts. The fate of the Yagyu clan hangs in the balance. Idiot! The post of the Shogunate Executioner will go to Itto Ogami. How can that happen? The tip of your sword dared to point at the Shogun. What were you thinking? I hear Itto risked his life to block it. Lt may have appeared so, but Itto had no skills to parry my sword. He just happened to be there. Stupid! Lt may have happened by chance, but it still means Itto surrendered his life to protect the Shogun from your sword. Gunbei, get up. Gunbei. I'll let you live only because I value your skills as a swordsman. As of today, however, it'll be known you've committed hara-kiri in penance for today's offense. Understand? Change your appearance. Leave for the north immediately. Summon Goroza the Kurokuwa face maker. Yes, sir. I am here, waiting for you. Goroza. Because you see Gunbei all the time, I assume you can copy his face. Please wait a moment. Good. It's all for the Yagyu clan. Will you die for us? Yes, sir. Commit hara-kiri. I, Retsudo, will be your second and decapitate you. Pardon. Forgive me. The Yagyu sword, for all appearances, came in second to Itto Ogami. Henceforth, Ogami will be the Shogunate Executioner. He will wear robes with the Hollyhock Crest and send shivers down the backs of the daimyo lords in 60 states and more across the nation. And his fame as a swordsman will rise. Compare that with us. The Yagyu clan will be made an example of and criticized on every occasion. I shall take Goroza's head here and present it to the Shogun and say falsely that it is Gunbei's, thus avoiding punishment for a while. Yet the root of the disaster will linger for generations. Damn Itto Ogami! We need a scheme to make it appear that he aims to destroy the Shogunate in order to eradicate his family name. The position of Shogunate Executioner must be regained by us. Had I stabbed you to death at that time, I wouldn't have lost my two brothers. I shall have my revenge after so many years. Itto Ogami. The Yagyu clan has taken the position of the Executioner. Everything will be over once I kill the hunted dog that you are. Can you defeat me, Itto? Kill me. Why don't you? You died once before. It's no use killing a dead man. I address the Merciful Buddha. My son and I stand at the threshold of the downward path through the Six Realms and Four Lives. When we meet parents, we kill them. When we meet Buddha, we kill them. Papa. There was a certain social class at this time. They were street performers and were considered to be outsiders and outcasts. They were called "Gomune." Songstresses, street dancers, traveling actors, street comedians, roadside minstrels and street preachers were among them. They belonged under the command of Jindayu Gomune, and their special network reached into all corners of the nation. Who the heck are you? I wish to meet Master Jindayu Gomune. I'm Itto Ogami. This is my son, Daigoro. We won't let no hired assassin get O-YUKI. Kill him. Let's get him. I mean you no harm. Papa. What's with the kid? He creeps me out. Why don't you be quiet? You're being rude to our guests. I don't know who you are, but I'm Jindayu Gomune. I am Itto Ogami. I've come with a few questions. Come this way. But, boss - Show him the way. Do you intend to find O-YUKI and kill her? An assassin would have no other purpose. Hunted by such a skilled swordsman as you are... What a poor girl. Did Owari Domain hire you? What a foolish question to ask of one who lives the way of the assassin. Forgive me. Yes, O-YUKI was a Gomune woman. She practiced short swords from childhood. She made an art of her skills and performed on the street. o-Yuki's skills with the short swords caught the eye of the Lord of Owari who was traveling incognito. The Lord of Owari had a great passion for martial arts. O-YUKI was hired as a sword mistress and taught the short sword to the women serving the domain. This is as much as I can tell you as head of Gomune. But as to what happened to O-YUKI afterwards and why she got herself tattooed to pursue the path of slaughter, that is none of my concern. I only hear rumors, and I've never confirmed them. On the other hand, even if I knew, it's not my place to talk. You're right. She's not a Gomune woman anymore. On the Kiso Highway, near Akasaka, I hear, there is a hot spring resort called Tsuta-no-YU. Those who wish to succeed on a quest visit this place and pray at the Water Flower Shrine and purify themselves in the water for seven days and seven nights, or so they say. Since you are on a quest, you might as well visit there. Many thanks. Excuse me. Master Ogami. O-YUKI is my daughter. TSUTA-YA INN Tsuta-no-YU is at the top of that hill. But it's such a lonely place. No one goes up there much now. What a laugh. You dare challenge me to a duel? Shut up! I won't stop until I discover the truth about your murderous illusion. What are you looking at? Stare at the flames and you will lose. Don't look at the flames. Be enchanted and you will lose. Don't get drawn into my illusion. Look at my eyes. Don't look at the flames. Look at my eyes and fight. My eyes. Look at them. Look at my eyes. My eyes. Look at them. Look at my eyes. What a beauty. You don't need to be a sword mistress. There's only one reason for a woman to be passionate about martial arts. It's because she's too ugly to get married. You woke up too late! You can bite off your tongue when I'm done. Daigoro. He never knew his mother. Please forgive him. Please, I beg you. Kill o-YUKI. Excuse me, sir, but Tsuta-no-YU here is visited by those who have an earnest wish to purify themselves and to pray at the Water Flower Shrine. Do you have such a wish, too? Lt must be an assassin's wish. Deserter YUKI, by order of our lord we'll kill you. Prepare to die. I heard you were after me. I have also heard your name - the assassin Lone Wolf and Cub. You cut off the top-knots of the Owari vassals. I want to ask you why. I am a deserter from the Owari Domain. Naturally, the Lord of Owari is furious and sends men to execute me. If I cut off their top-knots and send them back, in time, the object of my vendetta, Enki Kozuka, will be sent after me. That is why. Then I shall ask you this. Those who lose their top-knots have their families abolished. Some family members have swallowed their hatred and committed suicide. How do you answer their bitterness? You've involved others in your quest to fulfill your wish. Now they too have wishes. I met your father - Master Jindayu Gomune. As we parted, he revealed to me that you are his daughter. My own father - My own father... wishes for... my death, as well? Sometimes I wonder how lucky it would be for a child to have a parent... who'd wish for his death. O-YUKI. Enki Kozuka. At last, you're here. You appear to have grown even more beautiful. A Gomune woman looks better dressed for the part. You have help? I don't need help to defeat a sorcerer like you. Come on! It's different from the last time. This time, you must die. What are you looking at? I told you. Don't look at the flames. My eyes. Look at my eyes. My eyes. Look at my eyes. My eyes. Look at my eyes. I'm not showing my skin... as I die. I'm glad. I won't let your body be exposed to anybody's eyes ever again. For you to take the trouble to bring her home - I don't know how to thank you. Let me ask you. Her end was not unsightly, was it? Lt was a magnificent end. Excuse me. Just a moment. You did her a service by watching over her death. Would you stay with us and honor her memory? Consider it fate. I wish you to tell me about her last moments. You say he killed both Enki and O-YUKI? My men witnessed it with their own eyes. Lt turns out the rumor was true. Lt seems he means to defy, not only the Shogunate, but you as well, Lord of Owari. Not only has he arrogantly entered Owari Territory, but he has been staying with the lowly and despised Gomune community. Lt is proof of his intentions. If you leave him alone, you will be the laughingstock of the whole nation. Unforgivable. Damn! -Boss! -Master! The Owari samurai are coming. Come out! Come out, all of you! What's going on? Who are you? We won't let you pass! Shoot them. They're here, boss. Out of the way! What the - Are you Jindayu Gomune? Yes. What is all this commotion? What is it? We have a report the former Executioner and assassin Lone Wolf and Cub is in this village. Turn him over immediately. Otherwise, we have orders to burn down the village and kill all of you Gomune members. I refuse. What? Do you want us to burn everything and kill you all? Lt was about time to leave. You mustn't go, Master Ogami. Master Jindayu, I came here of my own free will. Let me go of my own free will. You mustn't. Do you intend to defy the Owari Domain? Master Ogami is a guest of Jindayu Gomune. Imagine if the Lord of Owari had invited a guest. What would you do if we demanded the guest be handed over to us? Fool! You're but a lowly and despised Gomune. Know your place. A word for you then. Your lord's tribute is 61 9,000 koku. He has about 4,000 vassals. Compare that with the Gomune members under my command. They number 200,000 in more than 60 states across the nation. I am not comparing our numbers or strength. I am talking about respect as human beings. The Lord of Owari is human, but we are human as well. We all eat and shit. There's no difference. It's only natural for humans to value honor and extend courtesy. You use your force and demand we hand over our guest, but we can't give him up. We have our pride as Gomune. Insolence! Are you mad? Boss! Bastards! Don't fight! You mustn't fight. Master Jindayu. Master Ogami. Take my head and bring it to the Lord of Owari. And then... tell him I, her parent, asked you to kill O-YUKI. O-YUKI deserted the domain and dishonored him. So, for the Lord of Owari, her parent had her taken care of. Then her parent died as an apology to him. Master Jindayu. The heart of a parent. The heart of a child, it must be. O-YUKI is - O-YUKI is saying, "Hurry and come over." She is calling me. Boss! Damn it! Damn. -Boss. -Damn. I'll have an audience with the Lord of Owari. Lead the way. Lower your head. Show respect. A word for the Lord of Owari. I didn't come as a prisoner. I came of my own accord. What? Lt appears all this trouble started with Enki Kozuka's misconduct. O-YUKI suffered a shame worse than death at Enki's hands, and so she deserted. She killed Enki with her own hands and avenged herself for her honor. I have presented myself here to inform you of this account. Are you out of your mind? To whom are you telling such a tale? Jindayu Gomune has no association with the Owari Domain. It's unforgivable you had him killed. Insolence! I'm Yoshinao Tokugawa. Where do you think you are? My son and I live on the Demon Way in Hell. The Tokugawas, the Owaris and even the Shogun's crest do not concern us. Kill him. Kill that idiot. Daigoro. Your life is mine. Don't move. If you dare to move an inch, the life of the Lord of Owari and his domain will be lost in an instant. ls that what you want? Let me tell your Battle Minister this - my son and I shall hold the Lord of Owari until we have safely left this castle. Please stand up. Please lead the way. -Damn! -Don't interfere. You mustn't interfere. Don't interfere. Master Ogami, please wait a moment. Wait a moment, please. Please take me with you. I humbly refuse. Then please spare our lord. Please don't worry. I'll return him safely. Hurry, my lord! Lord of Owari! Please lie down. Stop! -My lord! -Don't fire! Daigoro, listen carefully. I'm entering the Demon Way in Hell. If I don't return, you die here too. Understand? -Attack! -Yes, sir! Retsudo, here I come! Come on. Itto Ogami, this blade comes from the Yagyu Clan! You dare... Papa. Daigoro. Pull the sword out of my back. Impressive how you lived though it, Itto Ogami. Survive, no matter what happens. Neither Yagyus or Kurokuwas shall defeat you. I shall. Live until the day I send you to hell. THE END
