Whoo-hoo... Wah-ha! Ya! Go, horsie! Woo-hoo! Caillou. Maybe you could hold your horses until after lunch? Whoa, horsie! Sorry, Daddy. I'm just so excited to play Knights and Dragons with Sarah today. We're going to have swords and shields and maybe a castle and find the dragon... It's going to be so much fun! Y'know, a good knight needs a good meal. You're right, Daddy! Zoom zoom. Pizza fly! Oh, it's Sarah's mom. Hi, Luclan! Hi, Sarah! Hi. Is Caillou there? Oh yeah. He's right here. Hi, Sarah, are you coming over soon? Don't forget the shields! I don't think I can come over today, Caillou. I have a cold. That's okay, we have lots of tissues at my house! I don't think I'll be able to come to your house today. Sorry. But what about Knights and Dragons? It's not Sarah's fault she's isn't feeling well. Maybe you could tell her you hope she feels better? Oh, right. I hope you feel better soon, Sarah. Maybe then you can come over? Okay! See you when I'm feeling better. Bye, Sarah. I really wanted to play Knights and Dragons with Sarah today. She has the best shields, and we take turns being the Knight and the Squire. - Squire? - It's like a knight's helper. Maybe we could ask Leo, or Clementine, instead? Oh! Good idea, Mommy! Okay. I just asked their parents to see if they can come over today. How long does it usually take? Well, it depends... Did they answer yet? Not yet... What about now? Not yet. Oh, it's so hard to wait! Oh, is that them? Is that them? Is it?! Oh, uh... Leo is at his grandparents' house, and Clementine has gymnastics. Oh. I'm very sorry, Caillou. Would you like to play outside with Rosie and me? Um, no thank you. I just wanted to play Knights and Dragons today. Okay. Well, we'll be in the yard if you change your mind. Where are you going, Caillou? I'm going to play in my room... I guess. Beep beep... Watch out... The truck is backing up. Caillou? You know, just because Sarah isn't coming over, doesn't mean you can't play Knights and Dragons. But she was supposed to bring the shields. What if you make your own shield? How? Sarah's the one who knows how to make a shield. Oh. I know! I can call and ask her! Okay, Sarah, we have everything we need! Tape, scissors, and something to make the shield. We're using this pizza box. Cool! The pizza is the perfect shape for a shield! I bet you can cut around the pizza! Let's do it! Daddy, can you please use the scissors? Sarah will tell you if you're doing it right. You got it, buddy. I didn't know shields could be round, Sarah. Shields come in lots of shapes! Circles, ovals, even squares. How's this look, you two? That looks great! Good job, Daddy! Next, you need to make the handles. We can use these pieces of cardboard as the handles! But how do we get them to stick? You use the tape! Oh, right. All done! What do you think? It looks great, Caillou! Thanks for all your help! That's what squires are for. I hope you feel better soon, Sarah. I will. I just need to get some rest now. Bye, Caillou. Bye! Now I can play Knights and Dragons! But I still don't have anyone to play with. Mommy and Rosie are still outside. Hmm. I guess I could go see what they're doing. Giddyup, horsie! Yah! Whoa! Mommy, oh, Mommy? Huh? Mommy, what are you doing? Oh. I've been found! Caillou found. What are you playing? Hide and seek. Oops. Sorry. That's okay, Caillou. Would you like to play with us? Do you want to play Knights and Dragons with me? I'll be the knight, and Rosie can be... No, Rosie hide now! Oh no! Where could Rosie be? I'm sorry, Caillou, Rosie and I were already playing hide and seek. Everyone having fun? I don't know. Mommy and Rosie are playing hide and seek. Maybe there's a way to play Knights and Dragons inside. Hmm... How do I do this? Today's really not going as planned, is it, Caillou? No. I want to play Knights and Dragons, but without Sarah, I don't know how. You know, this reminds me of a story about someone else whose day wasn't going as planned. He was also a knight. Oh! I love knights! You do? I never knew that! But our story isn't about just any knight. It's about The Silver Knight. He was wise and strong and he had a good eye... for dragons. Dragons? Would you like to hear the story? - Yes, please! - Okay. Well, our story begins with a royal family... There was the queen, who loved to knit. And the king and princess, who loved to play checkers, just like everyone else in the kingdom. - Huh? - King me! I'm already the king! Hmm. Oh! A very cold king! Have you finished knitting my woolly hat yet, my queen? No, I'm afraid I'm running out of wool, my king. We simply do not have enough sheep to provide it. Oh. We would, if it weren't for that d-d-d... Huh? Dragon! I can't look... The dragon has taken our last sheep! Oh. Summon our son! Call... the Silver Knight! Your Majesty. Oh, you know you can call me Your Royal Momness. As you wish, Your Royal Momness. Silver Knight, the dragon has made off with our last sheep, which means I won't be able to finish knitting your father's warm hat. I don't like being cold! Silver Knight, I don't suppose you could find that dragon, and return all of our sheep to the kingdom? You are in luck. It just so happens that finding dragons is our specialty! Our specialty? But you're alone. No, I have my squire. Squire, if you please... Uh, squire? Oh, right. I forgot, she's home sick. Princess help! Yes, your sister, father and I could all help you. Thank you, but no. This quest is for people who are experienced with dragons. It's far too dangerous for the Royal Family. But uh... Sir Knight, how will you stop the dragon with no s... I believe what the king is trying to say is: how will you stop the dragon without your squire? Leave that to me, Your Royal Mom and Dadness. I will save the sheep! By myself! Brother! The princess gave the knight her cat doll. As a good luck charm. Thank you, fair princess. Onward! And the knight set off to find the dragon... all on his own. Daddy, I have an idea! What's that, Caillou? If the Silver Knight can do it, then so can I. I'm going to go play Knights and Dragons, by myself! Huh. I guess you could... Oops! Almost forgot these. Huzzah! Sorry, Gilbert, but I'm on a quest. Now that I have a sword and a shield, all that I need is to find the dragon. Let's see, where could you be? Maybe you're over... here! No dragons. Dragon? I bet you're back... here! Huh. No dragons here either. I've got you now, dragon! Ha-ha! Huh? Maybe the dragon is in the hall. Show yourself, dragon! Grandma? Are you all right, Caillou? Yeah. I was hoping you were a dragon, though. A dragon? Uh-huh. Sarah was supposed to come over to play Knights and Dragons, but she's sick so she has to stay home and rest. Oh, yeah, that's too bad. I'm trying to play by myself, but... Knights and Dragons isn't as fun without her. Well, I can't stay long, but do you want me to play with you? Uh... That's okay, Grandma. I was supposed to play with Sarah. Hmm. I know how you feel. When Grandpa's not around, the only game I can play is solitaire. What's solitaire? Oh, uh, it's a card game you play by yourself. You can play by yourself? Like the Silver Knight? Oh. I guess so. Here you go, Mom. Thank you, dear. Goodbye, Caillou. Oh, hey, how about you and Dad come over for dinner tonight? Oh. We'd love that! I hope you find a way to play Knights and Dragons. So... How goes the quest, Sir Caillou? Daddy! Grandma's just like the Silver Knight. She plays cards by herself when Grandpa's not around. So... how come I can't do it? You know, the Silver Knight struggled at first too. Would you like to hear more of the story? Yes, please! The Silver Knight walked along a country road, on his way to find the dragon and the sheep. He continued walking. But it was a cold day. Hot cocoa, Squire. If you please. Oh, right... Usually, the Silver Knight's trusty Squire carried hot cocoa to drink. But not today. Today, he was by himself. He hoped he could do the quest without his squire. Hmm. Hello, villager. Everything all right? Oh, Silver Knight! Thank goodness you're here. Would you please help me straighten this fencepost? A knight is always of service. Oh, hush now, Brian. Can't you see we have a guest?! That's a nice sheep you have there. I call him Brian. I used to have many more sheep, but they've disappeared. That's why I'm fixing the fence. There you are. All done! What do you think? Oh. Thank you, Sir Knight. You're very strong. Please, I have some hot cocoa to warm you up. Mmm... Marshmallows. I'm afraid fixing your fence won't help keep your sheep. The dragon is taking them. The dragon? Oh, my goodness. But fear not, because I am on a quest to find the dragon and return all the sheep to the kingdom. Huh? The dragon, look out! Oh dear, the dragon's taken Brian, too. Then I alone will return him with the others. Alone? Surely you're not going on this quest by yourself. Uh... Where is your Squire? Oh. Uh... She couldn't make it, today. Well, just wait right here. Now where did I put it? Nope. That's not it. Oh. Sorry, kitty. Ah... here it is! From my questing days. Perhaps it will be of some use later on. Thank you, kind villager. And don't worry. I've had lots of practice finding dragons during my knight training. I can do this all on my own. Good luck, Silver Knight. So, with a borrowed shield, the Silver Knight resumed his quest. Daddy, that gives me a great idea! Be right back! Meow? I'm back! Whoa, that's a lot of toys, Sir Caillou. Rexy is going to be the dragon taking the sheep. Dinosaurs are like dragons, right? Huh, I guess they are! Great! I'm going to practice like the Silver Knight. Then, I'll be good enough to play by myself! All right. Have fun! Okay, Rexy, you pretend to be the dragon. Just sit right... there. Good. And try to look, um, "dragon-y". Perfect! Now... Meow! Don't worry sheep, I'll rescue you from the dragon! Got you! You'll be safe over here. Stay back, dragon! Never fear, Sir Caillou is here. There you go! Now you're all safe! That was great practice! I feel like a better knight already. Okay, Rexy, what knight skills should I practice next? Hmm. Hey, you saved all the sheep, Sir Caillou! Yeah, I saved them, but it was pretty easy. Was it easy for the Silver Knight? Do you want to find out? Yeah. I do. Well, the Silver Knight, continued walking on the path in search of the sheep, and the dragon. And soon, over the hill, he saw what he was looking for. The dragon?! Almost. The dragon's castle. Whoa! The Silver Knight looked up at the castle, and saw that the castle door was closed. Well, I could always be polite. Hello? Dragon? Anyone home? Squire! A boost, if you please. Squire? The Silver Knight forgot, again, that his squire wasn't there. But, like most good knights, he loved a challenge. He needed something to get him over the wall. And then, he had an idea... Squire, hand me that... Oh, right. I'll do it myself. What you should know is that the Silver Knight, like all good knights, was a very good runner. But the Silver Knight's log wasn't tall enough to get over the wall. So... how did the Silver Knight solve his problem? Well, the first thing is: he didn't give up. Knights never give up! Then I won't give up either! Um, was there a second thing? We'll see. The Silver Knight, the wisest knight in the realm, knew he needed a plan to get into the castle. And how else to make a plan than to make... a model! Using the model of the castle, the Silver Knight tried to think of a way to get inside. Hmm. He couldn't climb, like a spider. No. And he certainly couldn't fly, like a dragon. But what the Silver Knight didn't realize... Wait, don't tell me! Huh? Caillou, where are you going? I have to get these pillows. - Pillows? - For my castle! If I build my own castle, I can figure out how to find the dragon too! That would help, right? Well, um, it's worth a try! Yay! Do you want my help? No, thanks. I can do it by myself. Hmm... I just need something for the top. Oh! Excuse me, Gilbert! I need this for my castle. Ta-da! Look, Daddy! Wow, that looks great, Sir Caillou. Good job. Thanks. Huh? Gilbert! Ah! Oh no! My sword! Meow! It's okay, Gilbert. You didn't know. Daddy... I can't play alone, and now, I don't even have a sword. You know, buddy, the Silver Knight felt pretty bad when he couldn't find a way into the castle. What did he do? Wanna find out? Okay. Now, where were we? Oh, yes... The Silver Knight was still trying to find a way in, but it was getting hard not to give up. Then he heard something. All right, dragon. It's just you and me! Huh? It was the king and queen and princess. Silver Knight! We've come to watch you defeat the dragon and save the sheep. Sir Knight, where are the sheep? I'm sorry, Your Majesty. I can't get into the castle and I've failed my quest to get the sheep back. Here you are, princess. I don't deserve this anymore. Your Majesties, I will understand if you take my knighthood away. Cat fly! Cat fly! Of course! What a great idea! Wha... what is it? I can use a see-saw to fly over the wall and into the castle. It seems rather small, doesn't it? No, Your Majesty. I will build a much bigger see-saw than this. But I'm afraid it will take me a long time without the help of my squire. Princess help? Yes, and we can help, too! Right, dear? A king can't be a squire. It will get your woolly hat made faster. King squire it is. The Silver Knight was happy because he would need all the help he could get, and who better to help him than his family. Whoa! Yay! Yeah! Huzzah! - Ha-ha! Very good! - Wonderful! They made a giant see-saw! Yes, but more importantly, they all worked together to make a giant see-saw. Oh. That's the second thing he did! He got his whole family to help him! - That's right. - But he still hasn't gotten the sheep back. I was getting there! The Silver Knight looked at the see-saw, proud of what they had made together. A hard job well done, Sir Knight. Thank you, but I couldn't have done it without everyone's help. S... so, what do you... What he's trying to say is... what do you call this amazing invention? I call it the Cat... apault. Yay! Cat. Oh... Great name! I love it! With this Catapault, I can fly over the castle wall and finally ask that dragon about those missing sheep. Aren't you coming with me? Me?! Of course! The Catapault was your idea, and a great idea is the mark of a great squire. - Whoa! - Whoa! Goodness! Hmm... I know! There! Yay! Mommy, I fly! I know, dearheart, be safe. Woah! Ready, my king? Ready, my qu... queen. Huh! Ha! The knight and princess squire flew through the sky. A flying knight! Okay, okay. Settle down now so I can tell you what happened next. Okay. What happened next? Well, the Silver Knight and the princess were flying through the air all right. But the flying wasn't the hard part. It was the landing. Oh... I didn't think of that! The Silver Knight and the princess squire were falling fast. Uh-oh. Don't worry, princess, it will be a soft landing. Huzzah! We found the sheep! Yay! Now, where is that... Look! Stay behind me. I'll protect you. The Silver Knight and the princess squire - prepared to approach the... - The dragon? Is it the dragon?! Daddy! Ah. Storytelling is thirsty work. So was it the dragon?! It was. A dragon with eyes like green emeralds and massive claws and sharp, yellow teeth. Wait a minute. What is it doing? Dragon play. It's trying to play checkers... with sheep?! Wait! Hold on. Do dragons even know how to play checkers? This dragon does. The Silver Knight put away his sword and started to talk to the dragon. Greetings, dragon! I am the Silver Knight and this is the princess. Hello! Sheep don't play checkers very well, do they? You look like you might be lonely and need someone to play with. We play. I was thinking the exact same thing. You know, everybody in our kingdom loves to play checkers. You can come by the palace and play any time you want. Would you like that? - Sheep? - Oh, right. Dragon, since these sheep aren't great playmates, can we please have them back? Our daddy is awfully cold without his woolly hat. Do... do you think it will be much longer? I'm royally c-c-cold. I'm sure it won't be. Oh... Huh? Come along, Brian. Huzzah! Now we have enough wool for the whole kingdom. Hurray! - Yes! - Huzzah! I royally proclaim: woolly hats for everyone! But what of the dragon? Goodness! It's all right. The dragon only took the sheep because it didn't have anyone to play checkers with. We play! Dragon play! Oh. Why... of course! All are welcome in our kingdom's family. Even d-d-d-dragons? Even dragons. Congratulations, Sir Silver Knight. You did it. Actually, we did it. I couldn't have done it without your help. And especially without the princess as my squire. Well, if that be the case, then I shall make her a knight as well! Now, if I only had a s-sword... Your Majesty! Oh. Heavy. You must be very strong. Please kneel, my dear. In the name of the crown, I royally proclaim thee a royal princess knight. We began today with zero sheep and one brave knight. And we end today with one, two, three, four, five... Well, lots of sheep, two brave knights, and one friendly dragon! I royally proclaim... a family game of checkers! - Hurray! - Yes! Let's go! Ha-ha! Well played. Oh. Wonderful move! And they lived happily and warmly, ever after. Yay! What a great story, Daddy! Thanks, buddy! So, what do you think the knight learned in the story? I think he learned that even though he didn't have his squire, he wasn't all alone, because he had his family. Hmm... Oh! That gives me a great idea! Rosie! Hey, Rosie! Rosie! Mommy! Can I play with you? Yes! Caillou play! I have an idea. Why don't we play Hide and Seek Dragons! That's a wonderful idea, Caillou. Thanks! But first, I have to make Rosie an official knight of the kingdom. Please kneel down, Rosie. I royally proclaim you Rosie the Knight! Huzzah! And here's your sword! Yay! Mommy, Daddy knights? Oh no, Rosie the Knight. Daddy and Mommy can't be knights. Huh? Because they're the king and queen! Huzzah!

Hi, Grandpa! How did Knights and Dragons go, Caillou? Great! I made Rosie a knight, and Mommy and Daddy are the queen and king. Oh. What a great idea! And Gilbert is the dragon. - Uh-huh! - But he's sleeping. What are you playing now? We were just trying to decide. Well, I brought a game. It may not have dragons, but it does have kings. Checkers! I love checkers! Yay! Checkers! Umm... what's checkers? Don't worry Rosie, we'll teach you! Ah-ha! King me! Daddy, quiet, you'll wake the dragon! Shh... King me.
