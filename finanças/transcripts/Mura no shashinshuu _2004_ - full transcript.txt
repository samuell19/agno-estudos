Good, good This group is ready to finish hurry Takashi! Where's my 30,000? You said you'd pay me back by month end. I know! Hello? It’s Nohara Masaharu from the Hanatani Village Office. How are you? I’d like to talk to you about something. Could you give me a call? Here goes... Great! So you're going back home for that photo book? My dad’ll take the pictures. He needs an assistant. Cool! Go for it! Hey! I haven't said yes. I don't want to do family portraits in the boonies! What?! In Taiwan it's natural that kids help their parents. We're different. Didn't you go into photography because of your dad? I like Bresson. Not crap like my dad's. Don't talk about your dad like that! Another lecture? You've been gone three years. He wants to see you! No, he doesn't. It’s just no one else'll help him. Why not? He's a stubborn old...nutcase. Then that leaves you. You have to do it. That's that. But it's back in Tokushima... in the middle of nowhere! Oh, no! Gotta go. Oh yeah? Bye-bye. See you. I’m not going. Takashi? It’s Kana. I hope you haven't forgotten Mom's 7-year memorial. Maybe Noriko might come home, too... A phone from my little sister had affected my heart inexplicable I don't know why, but I agreed to work... ...on Dad's Village Album. Photo Album of the Village Takashi! Hi Welcome home! Takashi! Good to see you! You look great! Thanks for coming! Come on! Let's go. No to the Dam! How does the home town look after so long? A lot different from Tokyo! This is great! A real Tokyo photographer coming home for us! I seemed to have become... ...a 'real Tokyo photographer'. Chie! How're you doing, girl? Don't you know me? Chie! Takashi's home! Takahashi Photo Studio Come on! We're back! I’ll make tea. I’m really sorry we had to ask you. I mean, asking you to be an assistant again... My dad said OK to this? Of course! You're sure? Yeah! Oh...hello. Don't just stand there. Go greet your mother. Guess we're all set to go! We're counting on you! Call me if you need me. Go get some good pictures. Why bow to me, Ken? The Village has no money, and here we're taking portraits! Of old folks, yet! I tell you, if you ask me...I’d rather have this. Is he mad again? What do you think, Ms Yamamoto? Ken! Hello! So you won't have to work here any more? Get our pictures, too! Yeah, make us look good! No one can make you look good! Thanks for everything. No, thank you. Good luck! Obviously the weekends are your best bet... ...but everyone's looking forward to it. They'll all try to fit our schedule. What if something comes up and they can't be home? We'll reschedule as we have to. Mr Takahashi, can't you go to more than three homes a day? No. Well, he can work away at it till it's done. Must be nice to have a hobby! Can that old man really pull this off? He makes his living as a forester! I’m sure Mom's happy you're home this year. I feel like I just happened to drop in. I didn't think you'd come. Kana... ...has anyone heard from Noriko? Dad, maybe... Would you like a drink? Later. Dad... ...Takashi's come all the way from Tokyo to help you. So don't fight, OK? Good morning! Hop in! Masaharu! I’ll walk. Takashi! Take this. -But... Takashi! Lunch. He's going to every house on foot? They're here! He made it! Some hill, eh? Line 'em up. Do us proud, Mr Takahashi. You're the boy back from Tokyo? 'Takashi'. Film. Film. All right, I’ll take one now. Could we put your great-grandson on your knee? Ready... Now! I’ll take one more. Ready... Smile, Grandpa. Now! Thank you. Thank you. G'day to you. -Hello. Workin' hard? Hurry up! OK? OK? OK, take it! Ready... This way! Sayuri! Keep still! OK? Yes! Now! Thank you. Mind you get this! Now! Thank you. Chie! You asleep? Quiet! Be quiet! Stand up straight! lf you please... Right! Ready... Miss! Number one! What?! Just hold it in! And two! Off you go! I’m sorry! Hey! All of you! Really? All right. Well, the next time you need an assistant, please call me. Yes... Goodbye. You know......we should go by car. This isn't efficient. Did you hear me? Don't ignore me! Takashi...'Efficient'? At what? Well, uh... Right on schedule! We've just started. Next is... ...old Granny Yamamoto... I haven't seen her in ages. I hope she's still alive. Granny? Granny Yamamoto? We're here to take your picture! Welcome! Welcome! Thank you Thank you very much. It’s been a long time. I’m Takahashi. This is my son. Isn’t that nice! I’m so glad you came. Thank you. Let me take a picture of you. Of course! Your husband was a fine shogi chess player. I could never beat him. Ready... Now! Thank you. Thanks. I don't know what fate... has left just me alive this long. I hope you'll live a long while yet. Thank you. How was your garden this year? Very good, thank you. The God of the Mountain was good to me. You've got a lot of persimmons. Sorry? Oh... Those are no good. When I get good ones, come and get some. I’ll call you. I’ll look forward to that. But you know, Granny... you should move down into the village. What if you get sick? But when Yoshiyuki comes back home... ...he'll miss me if I’m not here. That's Yoshiyuki. Huh?! And this is you? Yes You're beautiful! Oh, stop it! And these, too. Mr Takahashi took these? Hello? Hideki! How've you been? Yeah, I just got back. Yeah, sure. What the hell?! What's going on?! What happened?! Mr Takahashi! What's wrong? Hey! Takashi! Jeez! Sorry. Put a compress on where it hurts. Your stomach doesn't look good. You'd better have it checked. That's all. Thank you. Thank you! -Goodbye! Dad! Come on. -Dad! He's still got this out? So Takashi, what kind of pictures do you take in Tokyo? Naked women? No way! A lot more challenging than that. Magazine covers, you say? Wow! And it's great you live in Tokyo! I’m stuck here. I said I wanted to leave and my dad hit me! Yours let you go! No. He just doesn't care. lf you say so. Even if he doesn't care, it shows he has...faith in you. That's not true. I’ve got no desire to go to Tokyo. I’m fine here. All your life? Yeah. lf you want to go, then get the hell out! What kind of talk is that? For you this might be a place to come and get all nostalgic... ...but for me it's real! What?! Go back to Tokyo! Takashi! Hideki! Cool it! We're here! What's that hair?! What's going on? -Thanks! Are you fighting again? I want you to really run! Ready? On your marks... Get set...go! Takashi! You're up? Grab a bite. Think we got any fish? Come on! Wait up! Wow! What's that? Where's mine? Here. Anything in it? It’s huge! What! Hey! Let me try, too! I used to catch more fish than anyone in the village! Stupid! Look! Can you catch these? That's great! Huge, ain't it. I live here. See you. See you... Let's cook it? No! I want to keep it a while. Yeah. Hey! Wait a minute, OK? Here goes... Good, good... OK, stick your chests out. Perfect! You look great! Tell us when they're ready. See you. That was fun! -Yeah! Takashi! Where were you? There's trouble! What? Get in. Yesterday we had a meeting with Ohkawa Village. The next election will decide if the dam goes through or not. People are worked up. Some want it for the money it'll bring in from the government. Your father and some others are against it. They say there are better ways to develop the area. So again, nothing was settled. Afterwards they all went for a drink... ...and it turned into a fight. Dad! I’m sorry. We talked to different photographers... ...at the start of the project. Eat. I went to Tokyo twice. They all said no. Your father heard about it, and he came to the office... ...and begged to do it. 'Begged'? My dad? Frankly, it was a tricky situation. He's hard to handle... ...and there's some here who don't like him much. And you thought if I was with him... ...things would work out. I understand that... ...but I’m not very good at this kind of photography. I don't like it much. Try this. I love the people in this village. lf the dam goes through, it'll change everything. I think it's now we've got to do this. So please... ...stick with him a little longer. Please! 'Please!' It’s your dad who suggested you. I know you're busy in Tokyo, so I was against it. But he insisted. 'Please!' Want some fish? Excuse me... Could we trouble you to take our picture? With the scenery in the background... This is an electronic camera? 2 million pixels? 4 million. Yeah? Here goes. There. Perfect. Thank you. Lots going on in Tokyo? Yeah. Takahashi Family Here comes bear Give me one. -ok Looks like Noriko's stayed away, huh? Yeah. Kana! Help out here! Coming~ Hot water. OK. Noriko? Hi, Takashi! It’s me! You?! Where were you? Takashi! You're so slow Lin's been waiting. Waiting? What's going on?! Oh, 'Dad'...do you take beer with your dinner? We'll have this after. Thank you! What the...?! They smell good! Dad likes you! He's cool! I love him! We're having hotpot. We talked about you! Come on, Lin. Lin! Come have some! What is it? Fried noodles. It’s good. -Smells great! Is it really good? -Yes! Liar! Takashi? It’s been ages! How are you? -Great! Takashi! Come on! Come on! Takashi! Takashi! Come on! Go for it! Be right back! Go for it! Go, Takashi! Go, Takashi! Do it, Takashi! Go for it! Where do you guys go when you go out? That's a secret! Why? Do you have a boyfriend? You do, don't you! You do! Does Dad know? Dad! Ready... There! Thank you. You're so cool! What are you doing? Taking these... ...for the house shrine. Let's go. I’m glad I came! I saw lots of neat things about Japan! So happy! Lin... ...thanks. I wanted to see you. What's that? It’s 5 o'clock. They've played that since I was a kid. Somehow I got the feeling you wouldn't come back. So l... I hated it here when I first got back. There was nothing in the people or the scenery... ...I wanted to photograph. I thought my father was stupid for wanting to. But it's different now, huh? Did you really take this? Is that strange? Takashi... Don't worry. I’ll be back. A job's come up. Take a picture of me, too. OK. Ready? Coming here's made me homesick. You come to Taiwan next time. Here we go... Now! I’m finally able to draw this village. It’s taken two years. You've taught us a lot. Thank you very much. At first it was, 'I like this place, so I can draw it.' Now it's like the village is letting me draw it. So now I feel more relaxed facing it with a pencil in my hand. He's quite something! You think so? You'll never go back? There's inspiration everywhere. Some find it in Tokyo, I find it here. Finding it's the thing. But who knows? lf that dam goes through, life here will change. I hope that doesn't happen. Dad? Dad? What's wrong? Call an ambulance! Bring some water! Dad? Gone for a smoke? Oh, no! He left. He and the doctor were arguing about it... Not again! Dad! What the hell?! How can you be so stupid? I’m fine. Tomorrow we take pictures. What?! We still don't know what's wrong with you! I know my body better than anyone else. You're out of your mind! Dad! What? What?! I feel bad about this, after I asked you and all... Yes... All right. Goodbye. Is it OK? I can't leave him. I wonder if Noriko would come... I saw her one night. On the opposite platform in a train station. I ran over, but she'd gone. You're sure it was her? Positive. I only saw her for a second... ...but she looked really lonely. I was going through Mom's things... How long ago was this taken? We could probably get in touch with Noriko... ...but now matter how good a mood Dad's in... ...when I talk about her he gets mad... ...and starts shouting. Yeah... Let her be. It’s her life. I wonder if Dad would ever just cut me off like that... What'll you do when you finish school? I want to study nursing... ...and work in home care. Does Dad know? Sort of. So you'll be leaving, too. I don't have the guts to move to Tokyo... ...like you and Noriko. Maybe just for a bit... I wouldn't if I were you. It’s funny hearing that from you when you like Tokyo so much. Four years before, my elder sister... ...had fallen in love with a reporter down from Tokyo. Against my father's wishes, she'd left. I’d heard she'd had a baby, but that they'd broken up. Where she was now, what she was doing... ...Dad wouldn't say. Good morning. Good morning. Dad, are you all right? Look, let's not do this any more. OK? Dad! You're sick! You can't take pictures like this! I’ll take them. Enough, OK? Out of the way! There you go, always thinking of yourself! You never give a thought to anyone else! No wonder Noriko left! Mr Sato! Not this village! Tourists won't come. There's nothing here. Isn’t there anything? Well, maybe this is a wild idea... What if we turned the whole village into one big casino? Great idea! Maybe it's just going to sink behind that dam. Maybe. Yeah, but... ...why would anyone really ever want to live here? In two weeks, hell, three days, I’d go crazy! Hey! Say that again! Kid, are you drunk? Say that again! Mr Sato! Stop it! Don't! Someone'll get hurt! Stop it, Takashi Both of you...give us a break! Takashi... ...the trees I was planting before I started on these pictures... ...will live two or three hundred years. Amazing, eh? So will a picture. Forestry, photography... they're both good. The last picture I want to take is the guys I worked with. Wait for me! Dad...l... Takashi, we might have a lot of snow this winter. How do you know? From the wind. Noriko liked snow. You'd like to see her, wouldn't you. She's a big girl now. It’s her life. 180. That's a good hat. It is? Right out of the jazz age. Here we go. Now! Good. Thank you. What's that? To see how light you are. Ready... That's a nice smile, Missus. You too, Father. Now! Thank you. Ready... Now! Ready... OK. Now! Thank you. Thank you. Ken... Ken! Thank you for taking my father first. He was pleased. Really happy. Thank you! That night Dad coughed blood and passed out. With just one picture left to take... ...the Album was on hold. It turned out that Dad was seriously ill. Keeping it from Kana... ...the doctor told me he didn't have long to live. So it's going through, eh? Masaharu... ...where are the kids going to swim now? I’m sorry to bring bad news. It’s not your fault. Anyway, about the Album... Yes? I know it's a hell of a thing to ask... ...but I was wondering... ...if we could have Takashi take that last photograph. A doting father's request. As a matter of fact, that's what I thought, too. He's been with you all the way. He's the only one to do it. So I can arrange it with them? Please. I will. Come in. You have a visitor. Go in. Granny Yamamoto... The persimmons are ripe. I brought you some. You came all this way... You came down here alone?! Yes. The picture you took was lovely. I’m very grateful. Thank you very much. Hurry and get well, all right? I will. Well! Don't they look good! They're for you. Thank you. Did you hear? There's a key in that drawer. It’s to my darkroom. You can use it. You don't mind? More care Look everybody in the eye... ...and 'click'. Takashi... ...good luck. What're you doing?! Sorry. Could you all shift a little more right? That's good. You just had us move left. Are you satisfied now? We've still got work to do! Come on, kid. Hurry up. OK. Here we go. OK, ready? Now! Thank you. Thanks. Let's get going. Thank you. -No problem. It’s lousy. Lousy! absolutely not What's wrong? I’m useless Dad's pictures were great. They had so much life you could almost hear people talking. I wished I hadn't seen them. I couldn't take those pictures. Takashi! He's crazy. Working himself half to death like that... That's crazy. Yeah, but he's amazing. I finally see that. I can't do it. I can't. You can't take good pictures? I can't talk about the technical parts of it... ...but Ken won a lot of prizes before you were born. That's news to you? He's like that. I don't really know anything about him. You knew he'd lived in Tokyo, didn't you? Not even that? He was working for a paper when he met your mother. They got married and went to Tokyo. But Tokyo didn't suit Yuriko. She developed lung problems, and after two years they came back. Ken put Tokyo out of his mind. Although I’m sure part of him wished he hadn't. I didn't know. You could have just as easily not been here at all. Yuriko was sickly. The doctors said she shouldn't have kids. But they wouldn't accept that. They had you three and raised you. You should be grateful. He was very much in love with Yuriko. I think he took this photography job... ...even though he was sick... ...to say thanks to the village... ...for the time he spent with her here. I remember once he got drunk... ...which he doesn't often do... ...and he was very happy... ...that you'd gone to Tokyo. 'Takashi's doing what I couldn't,' he said. 'The kid's great!' He was bragging about how he was the one... ...who'd first taught you to take pictures. Got it! I did it! You did it! You did! Dad... These days I’m putting everyone out. Dad... I’ve been telling lies. I’m sorry. I’m still just an apprentice. I’m not getting anywhere. I’ve lied to everyone about the work I’m doing. I’m sorry. Takashi, could you raise this bed a little? Takashi... ...whatever you do from now on, and wherever you go... ...it all starts with Hanatani. Hell of a starting place, huh? Fool that I am... ...I was past 40 before I took anything half-decent. I thought it was pretentious of you... ...to insist on walking everywhere. But there are things you don't see if you don't walk. That much I’ve realized. Dad... ...you're the only one who can do the Village Album. It’s your job. Dad, walk with me... ...for one more shot. Good morning! I’ll go on ahead and wait. You take your time coming. Takashi... Take it easy. Call me if anything happens. Let's go, Dad. 'Bye! My legs've gotten weaker... 'Keep at it,' you always tell me. Dad! Dad! Climb on. Get on! Get on! Here we go! Takashi, I’m OK. I can walk. I’m fine. I can walk! -It’s not far. Masaharu! -Ken! Go! Watch it! Ken! Careful... Watch that rock there! Down you go. You made it, Ken! Sorry to put you all to so much trouble. I’m sorry! No, I’m sorry we were so impatient with you. We're all yours. Our apologies. At your service. Takashi...around the back. Not here? Out back. Everybody, please... Out back! Careful... Dad... Shall we? Tell us when! Make us look good. Ready... Now. One more. Shall we try a smile? Now! Thank you. Thank you. Well done. Thank you! Masaharu... ...I’m grateful. Thank you. Hey... Hang on... Your mother... ...liked that cherry tree there. Saying nothing more... ...Dad gazed out at the scene. Thank you. -Take care. Thanks. Dad! Look! She's beautiful! And here she was always fat as a dumpling! So? She dieted! It’s cold! Someday you'll dress like that. Stop it! Tokyo's cold, too. Send Takashi a sweater. I was going to send this when it's finished. But Lin's there. He'll be OK. Could I have a smoke? No, you may not! No? Hello? Call back on my cell. Dad... Dad... It’s a nice day. Would you like to go outside? Why now? Let's get you up. Here... OK? It doesn't hurt? You're OK? Get well quick, Mr Takahashi. Thanks. Kana -Yep? lf it keeps up like this, we'll have an early spring. Really? Yep. Who's that? I’m home. Don't surprise me like that. What brings you here? There's one village family we forgot to photograph. Who? Us. Dad... Here. What's your name? Satsuki. 'May'. Yeah? A good name. Dad! Mommy? Do you have a tummy-ache? Are you OK? OK Here goes. OK. Now! A month later, Dad developed pneumonia... ...and died. That winter, as he'd predicted, the village had lots of snow. Now Kana is training to become a nurse. lay it down a little Do you feel any uncomfortable? No Noriko has come back to Hanatani, and lives happily there with Satsuki. Take a brake after drying -yes It’s s comfortable Now I’m setting out again. Whatever the future holds... ...I’ll never forget walking with Dad, and us watching the sunset... ...together.
