Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Aishah, I'm heading out. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Haji, where did you come from? From the back. I watched the guys pan for gold. There are so many of them. If we allow them to enter our mosque may just collapse. We seek refuge in Allah. You're late again. Your father has already left. It's about time. Let's go. Muezzin, who's there? It's the Chief. We still haven't seen the Imam. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Allah Almighty. Parman. Muezzin. Muezzin, was Imam awake when you arrived earlier? As always his house was brightly lit. His car was there but I didn't see his bicycle. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Dawn is almost over. Muezzin, you lead the prayer. Let's pray. Muezzin! Muezzin! Muezzin! Muezzin! Muezzin! What's wrong, Amin? It's Imam. Imam Haji Mihad! Imam Haji Mihad? "Leader" "Anggerik Desa Village, 1983" "Anggerik Desa Village Community Centre" We seek refuge in Allah. I know you have returned. How did you know, Pak Ngah? I know you are alive. And I know you will return. Praise be to Allah. It is in Allah's will... we need someone like you... to return... to help the villagers... who for a long time... have lost their faith. What do you mean, Pak Ngah? As if you didn't notice. The villagers once led... an easy and comfortable life. A luxurious lifestyle. Before they forgot their roots. The villagers no longer listen to me. They call me a madman. Look, just look! Take a look! Besides Haji Salih's grave... I have seen with my own eyes... they came in big groups. Asking for... Asking for... May Allah provide refuge from evil. They ask for lottery numbers. We seek refuge in Allah. Allah has willed. Didn't Imam Haji Rahman say anything? He has long been sick. Who listens... to a man long taken ill? But... when I discovered... that you replaced him. I like it. I like you. Stop! Peace be upon you, Imam! Peace be upon you too. Syawal. - Won't you come in, Imam? It's okay. That was a good song. Although a little noisy. That's how it is. It's rock. It's bound to be a little noisy. Imam, is it true that music and singing are forbidden? Music is much like us humans. Humans... were initially created to be pure and good. We decide if we become an angel or a devil later on. Music is just like that. So music isn't forbidden in the religion? Forbidden? If it was forbidden, surely then in the time of Prophet Muhammad... He would have forbidden... His wife from watching the Habsyi people dance... or His wife's friends from singing. But Imam... Haji Abdul Rahman often scolds me. Could it be because you miss your prayers? It's not that I don't pray, I do. But he often tells me... that my prayers won't be heard as long as I play music. So all this while, our ablution is incorrect? What about our prayers then? Invalid? According to Pak Wa... if we aren't aware, our prayers are still valid. Fewer rewards, that's all. How would he know? Bit of a know-it-all coming up with a religious order like that! I've never been told off by anyone. I've performed ablution in front of far greater pious men in Mecca. No one has said anything. Don't listen to him. Don't pray at the mosque anymore. Just pray at home! But dad! - No buts! It's the same as praying at home. You can follow me to the mosque on Friday. I heard noises coming from here earlier. Where's that noise gone to? Gone? I heard loud noises coming from here a while ago. But it doesn't seem to be anyone here now. It's your grandson, Mom. He's being a smarty-pants... learning about ablution from Mihad. Mihad told him he was doing it wrong. I don't get it. What do you mean that he is doing it wrong? What don't you get? It's wudu'. Yes, I know. But what do you mean by that? Zali has been praying for a long time. Mihad said Zali performed his ablution wrong. So his prayers aren't valid. And? If that's the case, our prayers aren't valid then. Don't be nonsense, Mom. What do you mean? You just said Zali performed his ablution wrong. So our prayers likely aren't valid. Where's Rubiah? She's gone out with Ramlah. It's almost Asar and she's still not back. We run out of sugar. On this day today, in this age... are people still living like the Badwi? Today, not only do we make verbal promises... using our words but also written contracts... in the presence of a lawyer and witnesses. Yet we still break the promises. Nowadays, do we still have friends... who are willing to be a guarantor... to a stranger? Isn't it strange, those who are the closest to us... won't take the responsibility? And usually, those who are the closest to us... and we trust the most... are most likely to break a promise... lie... and betray their own flesh and blood. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Had! His sermon seemed to be directed toward us. What do you mean, Haji? Now, everybody is talking... about the meaning of my late grandfather's will. But... Imam is one of the trustees too. Yes, but he doesn't like that... we're using mosque funds to help people. But now he knows. Knows what? Knows what, Haji? People from the council have come to listen to his sermon. That one. That one sitting next to you is from the council. You don't need a ride? It's okay, I'll walk. I want to exercise. Syawal. Quick, come here. How much is this? What's up? I want to give you this. - It's a letter. How long you have been here? - I just arrived. If your dad saw that, you would be in big trouble. Who is that Muslim scholar? Tengku Ayah Daud Beureueh. I heard... his cause is similar to Kahar Muzakkar. Yes. But he led the people in his village in an extraordinary way. He was a scholar who is active and dynamic... in making changes within his community for optimum living. What sort of changes? He didn't like it... when people merely uttered Allah's name repeatedly. Even though he was in fact a Sufi follower. Teacher Haji, in my opinion... is a man of knowledge. Someone like him... will be of great benefit to the Islamic movement... rather than he be left wild on his own. Listen, Dato'. Would you let a tiger... loose inside our stable of cows? What tiger, Haji? Let's take... the story of Abu al-Hasan al Ash'ari... the Mutazilite as an example. That's different, Dato'. He was a well-known scholar... who brought immense benefit to us. But this man is a small fry. He simply does not bring any value. No difference is to be felt with his presence or absence. In my opinion... it is dangerous to let a man like that... become an Imam. That's why I suggest firing him. Much like a tiger, we need to remove its claws and fangs. We cannot only be issuing him a warning... for he will still be able to communicate with the people. We simply cannot allow that. If there is a law that allows us to expel him, we should do it. Expel him from his village, Dato'. Where were you? Rubiah! Did you hear me? I was at Pak Ya's house. Pak Ya's house or somewhere else? Dear! What were you doing there? Mom. - Let's have tea together. She doesn't want to have tea with us. She prefers to have tea with others. Where's Zali? - In his room. I forbade him from going to the mosque. That's enough. Let's have tea. I don't want her to marry Mihad. I don't want my niece to live in misery... with that low-life soldier. But they are already engaged. Let's not break their engagement. Anyway, it was your brother who brought them together. What does he know? His heart is as soft as broth. He wants any religious-looking young man... to immediately become his son-in-law. He's gone now. I'm the sole heir. I want Rubi to marry Syam. I know that Mak Long doesn't like me, Rubiah. It's okay. Let it be. Let her say whatever she wants. It's not her who's getting married. You're not married! You can't sit together unattended! Be careful. You'll cry when you get caught! Has the council reached a decision... about the accusations made against you? Not yet. They still want to see me. I don't understand why only now... people complain about my sermon. Before, you preached from the sermon provided by the council. Now it's your own sermon. Of course, there are going to be people who assume... that you are attempting to manipulate religious teachings. What wrong have I done? I said that by carrying out prayers... we get to appreciate... Islamic principles... like reciting the shahadah... almsgiving and fasting. And the meaning of fasting? Can we eat during prayer? The same with almsgiving. We give alms generously during prayer. Allah has made it such that some things... are donations to ourselves. We may not realise it... but every utterance of "Glory be to Allah"... "Praise be to Allah"... "There is no God but Allah" and "Allah Almighty"... are donations to ourselves. What's this? I heard the mosque has started a band. Not the mosque, Pak Long. But the village. Village or mosque, it's the same. That's the devil's instrument right there. You know that is forbidden... that it will incur Allah's wrath! Hey, Syawal! Do you know what it means by "to incur Allah's wrath"? Not all is forbidden, Pak Long. Perhaps you may have read... Imam Ghazali's writings... that said musical instruments can bring joy to the heart. If the heart is forced, it can become blind. On the contrary, if there is joy... it can help to make people more hardworking. At the very least... something that is mustahabb should be permissible. Hardworking? Permissible? You've crossed the line. I heard that you carried out a meeting... to start that band... in this very mosque. What's all this? From long ago, the issue with music has never been solved. This is only an issue of Islamic jurisprudence... and not a matter of worship. If Allah didn't like music... surely then the sounds of the dove... magpie... and cricket... wouldn't be music to our ears. I'm not referring to the sounds made by birds. I'm referring to music. None of this makes sense. In the name of Allah, this is all forbidden. What I mean is... The music reflects nature's melody. The relationship between the chirping of a magpie... and a dove singing beautifully... atop a lonely mountain. A group of crows... flying in huge flocks. The sound of an eagle... soaring in the sky. The sad hoot of an owl at midnight. Do these all not bring about a deep meaning? They are singing. Much like the voice of Prophet Daud A.S. Prophet Daud A.S was bestowed... a beautiful voice by Allah. And for what? If everything is the work of the devil... what do we have left here on earth? Enough! It's difficult talking to a stubborn man like you. I don't know what witchcraft have you used. But I'm extremely sad and regretful... for trusting you before. Since your return, you have done all sorts of things! I hope the council decides quickly. Haji Mihad needs to realise... that the changes he tries to make... aren't all good. Not all of it is reasonable. I have advised you from the very beginning... to appoint Haji Syamsuri as your replacement. But you insisted that Haji Mihad... was more qualified... more experienced... and more knowledgeable in matters of religion. Laura! He's on our side! Our side! Brother, help him! "Border of Kalimantan Sarawak 1963" Quick! Laura! He's the enemy. We need to hand him over to the Indonesian military. He's on our side! Our side! He's badly injured. Let him stay for a while. He might be a spy. It's dangerous for our family if we harbour a spy. Elizabeth! Let him be! I'll take care of him. You'll leave immediately. No one has to know this! Put that in mind, Elizabeth. But, Father... Father... Mum. Why are there people in this village that dislike dad? Dad returned with big ambitions. Dad's ambition... is to improve the villagers... who pray at the Haji Salih Mosque. Assuming that all was good... dad wanted to make it even better. If the intentions are good, why can't the villagers accept them? Aren't changes necessary? Dad brought on changes too quickly... and the villagers could not catch on. Imam Haji Rahman for example, that old Imam. He looks at Islam from a fundamental viewpoint. But dad is relatable to young people. Islam doesn't belong only to the elderly... and its practices... do not belong only to one race or any particular area. We are quick to punish. We assume that everything we do is right. And we refuse to correct what is normal... or normalize what is right. The other day, I heard Haji Syamsuri say something about you. He said you were the female Dayak beheader. Not only a beheader. She took my heart too. No. Everyone assumes Dayak people look fierce... with war paint on their faces, behead and eat humans. Those are all wrong assumptions. Why? Because these people never learn new knowledge... never read or traveled far. And that's why you have to get close... to a community to discover what they are like. So if that's the case, dad used to... socialize with the Dayak jungle people? I socialize with everyone. And one of the Dayak jungle people... I socialized with gave birth to you. But mum is different. She's not like what the villagers think. Knowledge. Knowledge is what builds character... and what differentiates us from those who stay away from it. We need to solve our problem. For what? We just need to solve our problem. What's your problem? We're bringing a small issue to the Religious Council. No, Zura. We need to discuss this. All I asked was for you to send our kids to school right? Yes, and let's go home after we solve this. I still need to go to the market... Peace be upon you, Haji. Wouldn't it be better if you park your car outside like usual? Forgive me, Haji. My respected brethren. On this holy Friday... I wish to remind everyone... Teacher! - Including myself... to be obedient... Did you notice the people in the first two rows? We have never seen their faces before. I don't know what's happening to our mosque. Even people from Binjai Village and Pinang Village are here today. Don't they have mosques in their own villages? Why is Haji Syamsuri leading the sermon? To make us successful human beings in this world and the afterlife. This means a time will come when a man is no longer concerned... if his treasure comes from... legitimate or illegitimate sources. Hadith Riwayat al-Bukhary. Allah. Haji, we don't have enough congregation today. It's not enough. Ask those outside to come in. I seek forgiveness from God. My fellow brothers... please come in. We are about to begin prayers. Pak Ngah, please ask them to come in and pray. You go ahead and pray. The rest of us will pray later. We can't be having two Friday prayers. Isn't that what you want? Did you hear what he said? You go ahead and lead your man into prayer. We will pray later. But we don't have enough people. Then why did you do this awful thing? Don't display your ill-mannered ways here. Don't fight. Imam. We want you to lead us. Agree. Anyone can be the Imam. Let's go. Our prayer time is almost over. Let's not lose this Friday. We would all like Haji Mihad to lead the prayer. That's true. Imam Mihad! Enough! Allah Almighty. So embarrassing. I didn't think it would fail. We have promised to our people. Our people alone were enough to hold Friday prayers. And why did you fail? There were not enough people. You panicked. We had strategized earlier. Even if all the villagers walked out... we could still carry out prayers. The congregation was enough. I heard three rows are full. Three rows meaning there were almost 40 people... including the others and outsiders. They didn't come. Mihad was so calm... and I obey him when he asked me to take over as Imam. That's what's so embarrassing. He outright insulted me. So, what now? What news is this? What news is that? You haven't read it? I haven't read the newspaper today. When are you going to read it? No newspapers at your house? There is. I haven't had time to read it. Here you go. Read it and quickly write a report for me. "Two Imams lead a prayer at a mosque" What is it? Thank you for the novel. No problem. Do you like it? There are a lot of chapters. I liked it too. I read it a few times. Lots of pages to cover. Let me know if you want to borrow it again. Sister, Dad's back! Syawal! Yes, Haji. Why are you so stubborn? I didn't do anything. Just giving back the Arena Wati novel. How many times do I need to tell you not to befriend Ramlah? Mom! Help, Mom! Come here! I told you not to do it again. You still do it, right? Why did you do it? I've warned you, right? You... I've told you, don't do it. You still do it, right? Allah decrees... - Pak Wa! That we must give alms... and therefore it is compulsory for us to carry it out... What is it, Ali? - Pak Wa! Come home, quick! Why? It's urgent. There he is. Go on first. Peace be upon you, Imam. Imam, my son. I'm not sure if his skull is cracked. Where is he now? He's up there. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. He's alright. Except there's a small tear on the skin of his head. I've cleaned his wound and bandaged it. Let him sleep. How did he fall? He didn't fall. He was beaten by Haji Syamsuri. Be careful. What's going on, Teacher? I'm not sure. I heard something happened. It's probably important. What important matter is there, dear? A catastrophe is about to befall our village. A catastrophe? What catastrophe, Haji Qamar? Haji Daud found gold near his hut. Timah, I heard... some people found gold near the graveyard. Is it true? Right, Timah. - You've got to be kidding me. It's true. You didn't hear anything? The whole village is talking about it. Is Yahaya here? - He's not here, Had. He's gone to town to buy raw goods. He was the mosque's Muezzin... now he's a champion checkers player! I'm rich! I have gold! I have gold! Haji, don't forget me and Yahaya when you're rich. So we're tearing down the mosque? I oppose it! Let the gold remain hidden where it is... as long as this mosque remains. I agree. Before the gold was found... this mosque was sustained by waqf. Haji... we cannot bring sentiment into this matter. The Chief and all of us... have always thought of the future of the mosque... for the next 10 to 20 years. Is the mosque always going to be this way? I agree with what you said earlier... especially when I think about the impending danger. Those who come here to look for gold... aren't only from this area... but from other places too. But Mihad, we can stop them. We can ask the government to issue a restriction order. We deny the discovery of gold. How long are we going to lie? For how long? Human lust. It hungers for worldly treasures. Men simply cannot keep a secret. Thank you. - You're welcome, Teacher. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. This is a restricted area. Please do not gather here. We just want to see if there is gold. Sorry, those were all rumours. Don't believe everything so easily. But this is waqf land. You can't prevent us from coming. The trustees of the Haji Salih Mosque have made a report... calling for no trespassing in this area. They have also denied the existence of gold here. Please disperse! Please disperse! Please disperse! If it really is there, just leave it. Let's not disturb it. Because beneath it is the Haji Salih Mosque... which has a right over the land. As the chairman and trustee of this mosque... I strongly oppose... the demolition of this mosque... its relocation... or even the setting up of a new mosque. A newly built mosque is simply not the same as Haji Salih Mosque. Among the present here today... I have been the longest-serving member of this mosque. This mosque is like my second home. I love this mosque like I love myself. That's why I cannot bear... to see this mosque demolished because of the gold. This mosque has always been taken care of... even when there was no gold. But denying a gift from Allah... is a big sin. Allah is pleased when we use... and harness His blessings. As proclaimed by Imam Maliki... a long time ago... when he was asked why he enjoyed dressing flamboyantly. He replied... "Allah is pleased to see His blessings upon His disciples." The gold which lies in the navel of this Earth... beneath this waqf land is for us to use. We can benefit from it. Catastrophe. Is it true? I hear there's gold near the Haji Salih Mosque area. It's true. I saw it. The villagers saw it. It's known that the area has gold. If we get them, we can become rich! That's true. Allah Almighty. Look, more are coming. More are coming over there. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Chief. Is it true that someone discovered gold here, Haji? I don't know but look at there. The villagers have been pouring in to pan for gold. We aren't letting it this way, right? The police have been informed. Perhaps they are on their way. Right. - We haven't seen the other side. There are a lot of people there. Let me show you. Dad, Pak Wa's car is having trouble. All this time, no one dared to ask about trustee account matters. Because I took good care of it. I helped all sorts of people. Suddenly now Mihad wants to check the accounts. Why? He just wants to make sure that the trustee accounts are in order. So I don't know what I'm doing. You still insist on defending your former fiance. What are you saying? How many times have I forbidden you... from seeing that Dayak woman? But you never listen! Do you think I don't know? Maybe it was the both of you that instigated Mihad... to check the accounts! Mom! We have arrived! Come. Quick. Come. Quick. Go over there. To the right. Run! The police are here. Run! The police are here. Stop! We're not here to catch you. Don't come here anymore. This is a restricted area. Pack up and leave. What do you suggest we do... with the gold found... in the waqf land? The trustees have agreed to the fencing up of the mosque area. Police have begun their patrolling. I don't think we will have any more problems for the time being. This is our only chance. We can use the discovery of gold... to topple Mihad. Thank you. Timah! Timah, is it ready? Elbow him, man! Elbow him! Hey! The false prophet has come. The false prophet knows. Pray. Found anything? Found something? - Yes, a little. Why are you late? Overslept. Dig there. A bit further. It's gold. It's gold! Take a look. - It's gold! This place really has gold! - It's real gold. It's real. - Let's keep panning. This place has gold. Let's look for it. Syamsuri! He's heartless. Because Debok couldn't take the heat... Debok ran away. Where did he go? Before heading to Mecca. Mecca? I managed to see him. He went to Mecca to continue his studies. Grand Teacher Haji Ismail... prepared everything there for him. But after disappearing for so long... Debok was found at a mosque. Then Teacher Haji Ismail... adopted him. Be patience. Be patience. There was a landslide. There may be victims who are buried. Why? They went against the restriction. They continued panning for gold. Haji Daud! There are three people buried in the landslide. Imam! Imam! Have they got all of them? Yes. - All three of them? How did you know it was three? Haji Daud. Where is he? - At my coffee shop. They brought in gold to the restricted area. After that... they claimed that they found the gold there. What for? What else if not to create chaos... so that the villagers would come back to the area? Is Haji Syamsuri involved? You ought to be careful... of that cousin of yours. My husband is deeply saddened... and does not wish to see anyone for the moment. Who took his car? Had borrowed it to drive to town for a while. But Rubi... Syamsuri cannot lock himself away like this. He is a leader. In times like this... we have to be with the victims of the accident. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. "A Soldier Went Missing" Dear. Yes, Rubiah. Forgive me, dear. Rubiah, have you read the newspapers today? Not yet, why? Here, read it. If there's nothing more, I'll be on my way home. Peace be upon you. Pardon me. Can we talk, my brother? What is it? Is it urgent? It is about the landslide yesterday. As a leader, you raised suspicions of guilt... by not being around. Dear, have a drink. Aisyah. Yes, dear. What day is tomorrow? Thursday. You've forgotten what day it is. Let's go to Maahad tomorrow. I haven't met Nurul for a while. Alright. Haji Mihad will lodge a police report. Haji Daud said he knows who planted the gold in the mine. We're in danger. Our names will be exposed. We're going to be in trouble. Haji. I have been coming to this mosque for a long time. I like Haji Mihad's sermons... even though he doesn't use any texts. You have been deceived. You have taken his bait. Since his return... the state of our mosque... even our village has become more vulnerable. Vulnerable how? The congregation is closer than ever. This mosque was built to worship, to gain knowledge. Not a kindergarten. Not a football field. Not a place to sing. Oh, dear God. These are religious innovations. Family ties have loosened. Me for example. My wife has become lax. She is seldom at home. Always out without asking for permission from me, her husband. Lies! Lies! I have never been lax or careless. I have always asked for your permission before leaving. Why do you lie? Why do you fabricate such lies? You dare speak back to me now! Syamsuri! Step aside, Mihad! Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Aishah. I'm heading out. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Haji, where did you come from? From the back. Watching the guys pan for gold. There are so many of them. If we allow them to enter our mosque may just collapse. We seek refuge in Allah. Late again. Your father has left. It's about time. Let's go. Muezzin, who's there? It's the Chief. Imam is still not here. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Allah Almighty. Parman. Muezzin. Muezzin, was Imam awake when you arrived earlier? As always his house was brightly lit. His car was there but I didn't see his bicycle. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Dawn is almost over. Muezzin, you lead the prayer. Let's pray. Muezzin! Muezzin! Muezzin! Muezzin! Muezzin! - What's wrong, Amin? It's Imam. Imam Haji Mihad! Imam Haji Mihad? Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Al-Fatihah. Al-Fatihah. Allah has willed. I have warned. But... by Allah's will... it happened. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. What's going on? - Haji Mihad. Haji Mihad? - Don't you know? Haji Mihad was murdered at dawn. The coffin has arrived. Quickly help. Quickly. Pass it. Pass it forward. Be careful. Pass it, pass it. Be careful at the staircase. Slow and steady. It's tilted. Lower it a little. Go to the back. Enough. Come in. Allah Almighty. Allah Almighty. Allah Almighty. Allah Almighty. Allah Almighty. Allah Almighty. "This film is dedicated to the late Datuk Abdullah Hussain"
