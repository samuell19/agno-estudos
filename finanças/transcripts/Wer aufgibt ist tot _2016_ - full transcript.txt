(Next time I come into the world, then as a bird.) (I can really give a shit to all of them.) (IF I'm born again.) (My name is Paul Lohman.) (I am 47 years old and I am dead.) (As well as.) (I'm going to have a car accident in less than four hours.) (Of course I don't know that yet.) (Edith - my wife.) (Tai chi... She thinks that saves her.) (Wonders from what.) (Of whom?) (This is Sonja, my daughter.) (She hates her life, her body, me.) (Possibly in reverse order.) (My house, paid off in seven years.) (My pigeons - priceless.) (196 hp: my car.) (Special tuning, special rims, limited.) (Good for my job.) (I sell mirrors - for 23 years.) Mirror on the wall, who are the best of them all? We! Friends, this is louder! Who? We! There you go. I am really happy, to be able to present the new collection to you. Janus... 2005! Yes, modern, timeless and simply beautiful. Even if it sounds like it, I'm not talking about myself. Yes, that's it from my side. (Five-time Seller of the Year, '99 through 2004.) (That was my life.) Lohman, Lohman! Everything okay? Yes, everything is ok. I'll never let you go. Ah! What's now? Oh no! Now the amniotic sac has burst. This time it's going to be a mama's child. (That was once.) (I'll be dead soon - in 23 minutes to be exact.) (But can one die when one is no longer alive?) Hello, I'm Paul Lohmann. Glad you met me. Good for you I'm here. My name is Paul Lohmann. You can count yourself lucky that today I... Just don't mess it up again. Pull yourself together! Who gives up is dead. I'll pay that. Uh, extra. Never mind. Here. For safety. For safety. If you need a mirror for the shithouse... I'll give you a good price. ...a wonderful autumn day. The temperatures... Will you take me with you? Yeah. Willingly. I can understand. Hm? With the shield that. My God, it's nice if you still have dreams. Pilot. What? I once wanted to be a pilot. Well, mother dies early, father needs someone to lend a hand. So life is. Now I breed pigeons. Swam over it. I'm on my way to a super shop - Spiegel. Put nothing in, you'll get nothing out. By the way, this is my car. Yes, nothing company car. Makes an impression on customers. That's so. Record sales '99 to 2004, toujours through. The 2000 record still stands today. Yes... You don't need a mirror. How you look. Uh? Yes, what the heck. Life goes on. Lohmann takes off again. I get the curve. Can you hear me? I'll surround you now. Danger. That can not be real. Dream. This must be a dream. M-m. Nothing happened to you? Intermediate world. Between what? Well, this. This is between life and death. Come on, let's go. I'm with you, calm down. Hi! We go! Where? Where to? Serious accident, you lie motionless You're in the in-between world, and that's the end of the tunnel. That will not do! That's how it always works. But not for me! I have the most important appointment in ten years. In half an hour! It's closing time here. Here! I'm not even 50. I'm not sick. I'm in great shape. Besides, life doesn't pass me by at all. There's no bright light or anything. Here, ambulance. He'll get me back. He is unconscious. Intermediate world! Edith likes this kind of nonsense since... Since when? What? Since when is Edith into such a fuss? Between life and death... There's still life in me, it's logical. "Still alive" or "already dead". Not quite dead yet, good guy. Maybe as a spare parts store. What? I would have to inform the relatives. He has a letter with him - Paul Lohmann. His wife wants a divorce. Divorce? Didn't read the letter? But divorce?! Can it be you? If Edith decides they get my organs... Do you trust her? Man, what did you do to her? What? Nothing! We're just married. Long time. Hey, I'm not dead yet! They don't hear or see you. It's over. Now listen to me carefully! Lohmann says when it's over with Lohmann. I've had a lot of shitty years. It's just going up, it's not over there! Who are you anyway? My angel? All your fantasy: blonde, big tits... In the intermediate world you can determine everything - just like in life. Bullshit! Who can control their life? What if I was into red? And on men? Oh God! This is a dream. I drank way too much yesterday. Hey wait a minute! You can't cannibalize me! We want to see that! Hi! No, no, no, it won't work that way. I'm not dead yet It will be fine! Man, man, man. October 9 at 11:43 am. I have to remember. I was almost over the Jordan. (Nothing.) (No hint. Not yesterday, this morning...) Everything quite normal. So what is that? Maybe his lucky charm or something. (Terrible things always happen on normal days.) (Everything was the same as always.) (Except for this stupid letter.) That's the right song for a wonderful autumn day in Heilbronn. What is? Anorexic, as you can see. Crack the Americans and you're back on top. So you're still down. "I have record degrees, '99 to 2004 toujours through." Understood! It's 2015 now. The 2000 record still stands! Morning. Morning. Morning. What happened then? Oh, banged, not bad. Oh, until the boys agree on an annual report. And then it was all about the anniversary - you know it. "What's for dinner? Cold or warm? Grilling? Yes but what? Beef or chicken?" Poultry in the pigeon fanciers association. Crazy, right? Then it was about the race dates for next year. To vet costs, bird flu again. Apparently there's a new vaccination. But what does it cost! Twelve euros per bird! They deserve... Paul, leave it! I was at the clubhouse last night. That is... You never do that otherwise. I came from the cemetery. I'll join the club later. When were you there? I was checking on you. I was still working. I thought you might have the courage for once. I've got a big thing going on right now. Tool Tiger - I wanted to prepare that. Should be a surprise. Thanks. Some fruit. Tool Tiger, these Americans, are completely new on the market. If they take the whole new collection that's easily half a million. It's healthier than your incense sticks. I have a good feeling. Again. Maybe there is something wrong with your feeling. Bye. Do you notice that? What? Sonja, she's changing. I am worried. We need to talk, Paul. About Sonya. No, about us This can not continue like that. Clear. This evening. Tonight we talk. And we celebrate the commission. Tonight, no problem. I gotta go By the way, you're in the newspaper again. With your fuss last night in your bookstore. Bye. Good morning my beauties. Come here. Yeah. Princess, that looks quite passable. See you later! Are you okay? - Yes. Did you sleep well? - Mmm. Look, your father. No stress today. Morning. Morning! Well, everyone there? That's why it smells like that here. Morning, Herrman. Morning. I need the models. I gotta go boil the Americans. By the way, that was my idea, already in '98. All models in miniature. It's much better for the customer than such stupid brochures, right? Right. Sure Paul. Horns shed? Oh yes. A little. Thanks. On to the fight! Why does someone like that get another thing like Tool Tiger? It's only a matter of time. In fact, he was really good. The best. Lohman! Boss! No time, Tool Tiger is waiting. Please come. Morning. Morning. The Autobahnkreuz hardware store is now ordering from the competition. They fall for the junk from China. I've been on the phone with customers. They are often late and sometimes drunk. That's a lie. In Pforzheim you tossed a coin so that they order something. Won. Then you have ordered too much. Something went wrong. In the computer - a clear deterioration. If you mess up today there is still a significant deterioration - for you. Your father... My father is dead. With me you have no bonus. I conquered the wild west for the company in 2001, 2002. And you screwed up our business in the East in 2007 and 2008. It was a difficult time. Her father knew that. You spent the hard times in Warsaw's brothels. Does your wife actually know that? Have a good time. Your ass cheeks will flap that's how much commission you have to deduct. Hurry! Otherwise he'll nip off! Come on! Wake up you idiot! Wake up now! You have to help me. So you. Us. Now you're off, you bastard? I'm not crying for you! I'm crying for me! Do you hear? Because of me! (Edith ...) Good day. - Good day. Excuse me... We heard that my... my... The emergency doctor said that her husband is only an organ donor. It's possible, yes. I don't give you hope. And do I have to decide then? You are the next of kin. Has he ever talked about it? No. Familiarize yourself with this. Thanks. Please. I don't know what to hope for. I'm here and I'm staying. As long as you need me. What a shit dream. No dream. How are you from? Intermediate world. You can move freely in space and time. My successor is already lurking. I would have left you sooner. Then just go. Through time and space. You have to come with me. Your appointment is over anyway, come on. Nope! I will not give up. I conquered the company France and Benelux, because I didn't give up. That is something different. Is not it! Who gives up is dead. And who is dead... Between life and death. I'm not dead. Typical, in life a big mouth but when it comes to dying, a cowardly philosopher. It's over. Over. Finally. Scythe. It's good! Scythe. Intermediate world, so you can go anywhere? No limits. Now comes: "just a minute". Left a minute earlier, and that wouldn't have happened. I just need a second. How does it work? Turn back the clock, or what? I'll tell you. Come! You said I choose. Then I decide now! October 9, 2015 at 7:45 am. Moment! Lohman? Lohman! 9th October... Yes, not a dream. Intermediate world. Shit. This is the right song for the day. A wonderful autumn day in Heilbronn. I'm great, thank you. Spittacular downright. Morning. Morning. Mmm. What happened? Not bad. Until the boys agree on an annual report. And then there was the Christmas party. Eternal. I'll be there later, I still had work to do. You were just gone. You've been to the graveyard, right? Yes. I was alone there. Yes, I'll be there later. Paul, don't lie yet. Paula is your daughter too. What happened? Paula swallowed a marble! I'm following! Egg? I just have to hurry towards the tunnel and then to Tool Tiger, then everything will be fine. See you later my girls. Everything will be fine. Paul! That can not go on like this! I have to go. Read this! Herrmann, do it now! No stupid saying? Give it to me! Will he be tolerated in his old age? Lohman! Boss! Wait, I'm just coming. Morning! Morning. It's about... Hardware store at Autobahnkreuz? Yes. Didn't work out, I know. We won't be blackmailed. 15% discount. What for? They should buy in China. The manager says... The Himmelsbergers, right? She says I'm late, that I'm drinking... She wants to finish me if you don't get special conditions. But we won't let ourselves be blackmailed, not with us! So, I have to, Tool Tiger is waiting! Open up, no! 11.43 a.m. out of the tunnel, you can do it easily, Lohmann. You make the deal and Edith reconsiders. You don't just throw away 18 years. Crap! This will definitely resolve itself again. So, Tool Tiger, dress warmly! Crap! Oh man! All idiots today! Yes... Away, away, away! Once again! Path! OK. Just a second earlier... So much for that. Hey Lohman. Lohman! That's no use, get it. No matter how early you start, no matter where you drive... I have something good with you. Pub crawl with all the bells and whistles. Won the lottery? Nah, Tool Tiger's commission. Holy shit! Once again! Path! Paul. Where have you been so long? Oh, you know the boys. Do not lie to me. We have to talk, this... This can't go on like this. I knew you were saying that now. I've seen it all before. Deja vu after 18 years of marriage, that happens. No, now, today, here. Everything you do, everything you say what will happen, what will happen... The accident, my accident. Please be quiet. Something strange is happening. I thought I dreamed that. Of in-between worlds, but... are you making fun of me? No, I won't! I'm going to have a bad accident, do you understand that? You're hiding like always, I understand that. You lie and hide. Good night! Yes, I get it. His heart had stopped several times. But it strikes again. And what does that mean? We need to investigate if his brain has been damaged. Only in the case of brain death can the patient be considered as a donor. Emergency. They fished a boy out of the river. I'm available anytime. Thanks. If he's brain dead, they want me to release his body. "Release" - what kind of word is that anyway? They mean "cannibalize". And you will allow this? I do not know. I don't know what he wants. Last night he talked about an accident. An accident he will have. He didn't do it on purpose. You've been married for almost 20 years and you're sending him a letter? He doesn't listen to me! I've tried so many times! When would you have talked to me about it? What kind of shit family is this?! I'm sorry Sonya. But you are also part of this family. Oh really? But I'm not even in the cemetery. Yes, go to your lover! He is my colleague and a friend! Understood. What is? I don't think I can take it. Crap. I look like him. She cried. You will not escape me! What is this? Atone for sins? Waiting for Edith's decision? You do not have to wait. Unless you want to atone. Stop it! Your decision. Exactly not! If I could choose my life... Then? Then I would be a pilot. On the go in the world. Then Edith would save me. You don't get it. It's not about saving, it's about your resignation, drop your spoon. How you talk! Are all your words do you love her Edith? Mmm. Yes. Well, it's 18 years now, it's not like it was at the beginning. It is different. Yes, stop less. And at some point... it stopped. That's so! You don't notice that. I didn't notice. Not really. Yes, when Paula died, it started. Oh, finally a culprit! When your own child dies, nobody can put up with it. I know your life. All. I know why you don't share your grief. What went wrong in my life? Nothing! It's just your life. You are you. Come on. If you wait any longer, you'll only make it harder for everyone. Something's going on! Something's going on between them. Hence the divorce! A woman doesn't need a guy to break up! Why didn't I get a nice grandma? If you were an angel. Wouldn't you keep picking on me When it comes to angels, you only ever thought of the outward appearance. The rest is my interpretation. And that's annoying. I want to survive. For what? For whom? For whom? When she's so thoughtful, she's so beautiful. That was here. Nine years ago with Paula. That was right here. Here we sat and hoped. Hoped so much. Yes, she's right. Yes, it was right here. I can't do this again. We never slept together again. Now comes the tour! Sex and then everything is fine again. That I didn't think of it. I mean a child. We could have tried again. Yes, good insight, remember it for the next life. Come on! Wait a moment. Hm? Edith said for talking about the accident last night. So she remembers it. Hallelujah, you told her. No, she remembers the last time, last October 9th. It's like a tape that you can replay, once, twice... But what counts is what happened last. That means... I can erase my old life. Oh, now you think can you start life all over again? But everything goes on in parallel. And when you're over here, then all in all it's finito. No matter where you are in space and time. Lohmann... What do you even want? Just more sex? I want Edith to remember me differently when she hears about the accident. And Sonya too. Yes, so they don't turn off the devices. Leave it, it doesn't work for me. I know you. You always practiced looking in the mirror. Yes, and it worked. Not any longer longer. Departure. You finally have to accept that you're almost... So what! Two more, maybe three rounds, and we're there with you too. Paul! Paulchen! Are you asleep? What day is today? I don't believe that now! 8th October! Half past midnight! What's wrong with you? It wasn't that much champagne either. Your shift begins. Since when do you care? And your husband will be there soon. It's at the butcher's. No, he's coming soon. Where do you want to get that from? Déjà-vu. What is? I... I dreamed it. Just between my legs? Yes. Shit, what do we do now? Did you dream that too? Hello Uwe. Hello Uwe. They fired him. But... that you dreamed that... You're so great. You have to go. Bye. Hello, Ms. Himmelsberger. Slime Kruger. Mrs. Himmelsberger! Lohmann on time. I can not believe it! Yes, very funny. Let's make it short. I saw Kruger was there. So you fall for the cheap junk from China. Too bad, but... Yes, take care. Good luck for the future. Um, you ordered from him, didn't you? As well as. As well as. That means there is still something to be saved. Let's not break up like that. Heads or tails. Head: I'm leaving immediately. Number: You order from me one last time. A little fun in the gray everyday life. You get three percent and real Jannus quality. What have you got to lose but my company? You have changed. I told you so, Herrmann. 20 Excelsior edge grind and 15 Caribbean oval. Yes, of course not huge, but still. The hardware store couldn't resist me - Lohmann is back. Hm? But hello how I pack the Americans tomorrow. Bye! Morning... Edith? "It's night, my heart comes to you. Can't stand it, can't stand it anymore with me. Lies on your chest like a stone. Sink in, into yours. Only there, only there does it come to rest. Lies at the bottom of his eternal you." Very beautiful. Is that the morning star? Yes. Nothing fender damage. Rollover. Unconscious. With all the harassment. 'a bad accident. And you have that tomorrow? 11:43 a.m. I had him yesterday too. And now you're back because today is today. Exactly! Intermediate world. 8th October. Right? But I've already got the 8th of October behind me - yesterday. And now it's October 8th again, because I want it that way. I recreated it. And I'll make October 9th a brand new one. Everything, the whole future. Well, actually I'm then, yes... something like this... God. ...one thing came out of my research: That those who have lived their lives to the full find peace with death. You can go. Just let go and go. Into the light that envelops them at the moment of death. But how terrible it is for those who come back to life. On my whole... Total bullshit! I came back from death And you are all only there because I want it that way. Because I want my wife back. Edith! She's sitting in front! This is my will done here! I am God! Why are you embarrassing your wife? I love edith. And are you doing this to her? What are you doing to her? You fuck her, strife! (You can always do better.) (Until it's perfect - eventually.) Yes, 20 Excelsior edge grind, 15 Caribbean oval. Yes, hardware store Autobahnkreuz. And tomorrow the Americans and the day after tomorrow a new record. Lohmann is back! Exactly. Bye! Is something wrong with Sonya? Nope. Why is that today? I wanted to take you to dinner. We have the reading today. One hour. I thought we should talk. About what? About Paula? Yes. Also. "It's night, my heart comes to you. Can't stand it anymore." I found it. Hello. Morning Star's Poem. "Only there does it come to rest, lies at the bottom of its eternal you." A poem. Very beautiful. Here. Not on the books! Please, Edith. One hour. Where are we going? Surprise. It's been almost exactly 18 years. That was right here. Edith, do you want to be my wife? In good days and in bad. Paul, I don't know. We don't know each other that well yet. Oh, who cares! We know each other well enough, this will be great! We're going to live in a big house and have children, four, five, six, ten! And dogs, cats, an elephant if you want! We go through thick and thin! You said we'll be happy. Always. Yes, we will be happy, Edith, always. I promise you that. Oh, come here you! Yes, you've gotten fatter. Yes, a little. Haven't heard from us for so long. Our song. I'll never let you go. Paul... I want to separate It's too late for all of this. You've spent so much time at the club, in the... job and with the other women. It was only because... It was only because... Paula. Yes, you shagged out of grief. Probably needed a threesome that you share your grief with me. I want to live. Edith! I want to live. If you are asked: I want to live. I love you. Did you say something? You can't stand on one leg says the flamingo. Father? Sonya... Sonja, I love you very, very, very much. Do you know that? You know that, right? And you, tell me, do you have me too... So, not if you hate me, but... Do you love me a little too? Can't you at least just be embarrassed at home? I am the father. Jutta! I love you. Are you crazy? It's still there. I know all that! But I have so much love inside me. Why doesn't anyone want them? I do not get it. Why not? Hello Uwe. We lose him! Get off the bed! Cardiovascular is okay. Breathe again. Prepare Eurotransplant. Pull yourself together, dammit! Ms. Lohmann, the injuries were too severe. And that means? I inform two colleagues who need to confirm my diagnosis. What diagnosis? Your husband's organs are working, but... his brain is dead. Does that mean I have to decide? Yes. But you have to be able to live with it in ten years. I don't even know if I can live with that now. You still have a little time. I have such a funny taste in my mouth. Do you have any chewing gum? I should have left him much sooner. I thought that once he shares his sorrow with me, comes along to Paula's grave, everything will be fine again. Mr. Lohmann, we found that in your daughter's lungs. Yes, and I shall say hello to you from Papa and tell you he loves you You know, he's got this big deal going, and there... he has to prepare. But one day he will come for sure. Is something wrong with Sonya? No. I would like to talk to you. Also because of Paula. This evening? We have the reading. I want to talk to you. Tomorrow will be too late. I already explained that to you. When? Yesterday. Oh no, that's later. So if I tell you this, that's after. Did you drink? No. It's just so complicated. Let's talk tonight. Please. Good, home tonight. Yes. What's going on here? What does it look like? Are you doing this for mom? It must be terrific what you screwed up this time. Your sister died nine years ago today. Not just her. What? Do you want to celebrate? How can she talk like that, my daughter? Not even her dead sister is sacred to her. Mama would have slapped me right now. Oh shit! Oh man! I always thought you didn't let anything burn. Sonya! Hey! You have school tomorrow and are you going away now? You have a deal with the Americans tomorrow and you're getting drunk? No, I won't. 'Good evening. Shall we toss a coin? I take number. Where to go now? - Rose Club. "Stritter Bookstore. You're calling outside our opening hours." Paul? I am not drunk. Here. You never could. I have cooked. What then? Fish. I don't eat fish. Meat. You don't eat meat. I don't eat fish, not for a long time. Well, it's burned anyway. I have... noodles with veggies. I have already eaten. But thanks. Paul, what made you think of something like that? Come back up! We should have had children. That would have been good. Paula? Where's Paula? Where are your pictures? I thought it would be good to start over. By getting rid of the pictures? Why? You forgot her anyway. How many times have you been to her grave? You weren't even there today. That doesn't prove anything. What then? How many times have you cried for her? How many times have you dreamed of her? How often do you think about how she can't breathe anymore because of that fucking crystal ball? If there was anything else between us like love or affection would you share your pain with me You want to start over, get rid of her pictures. When you start over, you have to face your pain. You can't pretend like nothing happened. And then you have to live with your pain. I have an accident tomorrow. Leave it! 11:43 a.m. Leave it! Edith, just you... Paul, that's so small! Edith! Edith! Now listen to me... I was to blame. I am guilty. Because I was so proud. No, I was vain. I just wanted my girls to admire me. That they are proud of their dad. Because of those shitty mirrors I sold by the thousands. I should have known. When I built the mobile. I screwed up, princess. I made it worse. And now it's too late. What kind of stupid, stupid person are we both? You were at the grave. You could have gone to Edith and everything would be fine. Yes, perhaps. But you haven't. 'Cause I just went because I knew that everything would be fine then. You don't decide about life or death. He's already dead. Brain dead. He was so different yesterday. There was such a tenderness in his voice as before. There's a reason I used to love him. Yes, there are also a thousand reasons why you want to leave him. To make her remember you better... See how hard you're making it for her? Yes, but then what remains of me what if it's over now? Brain dead is dead, says the doctor. Then why am I still here? Why? You really have no idea. Don't you get any training there or something? Hm? It's going ok. If he were really dead I wouldn't be either, you said. She's just not right, the doctor. I'm not dead yet. Paul I can do it! Was that intentional in the tunnel? What should I do? Give me any sign. I need you. Mrs. Lohmann? Your husband's things. Paula. I always thought he forgot Paula. She died from the fucking bullet. Everyone I've read about would say that his soul has already left his body. Max, you read a little too many books. That fear back then doesn't just go away. Or the fear now that something could happen to Sonja. I've been with Paul for almost 20 years. It wasn't just bad years. I can not say that. That was half of my life. There is a receiver for his heart. You have to decide. And how long have you known that? - Please? Recipient! Is that why you pronounced my father brain dead? It has to be clear in an hour if you agree, otherwise... ...the other one dies. Yes. Maybe a family man. - He also has a family! How much do you actually earn from it? Believe me, it's no fun to deliver such messages. She fights for you. I know. But I should have been the one fighting for her. For her trust and her love. And their respect. What does that mean? That I can't give up I have one more chance. Because I decide. Bets? That was clear. Little game? If you're what I want, you gamble. Head: I'll come with you. Number: space and time, one more time. Come on, have some fun in the gray in-between world. What have you got to lose but my company? Number. "Lohmann! Where are you? Drank or what? You wanted to pick up your collection for the Americans. Man, Junior's got your ass!" "Lohmann? Nussbaum here. I expect an explanation. And the only thing I accept is earthquake, deluge or death!" Great job. "Father". You are such an ass! I did not want! Sonya! I did not want! Sonya! Open up, come! Come on, let's talk! What is that? Ecstasy? Give me that! Give me that now! Are there any bonuses for faithfully caring fathers? I know I deserve it. But we also understood each other better. That was in another life. Come on! Go to your pigeons, the bastards! What do you want from me? That it's like it used to be. And it can be like that again, I promise you. Paula's death ruined everything. You ruined everything! You and mom! You only used Paula's death to lie to yourself. Everywhere only Paula - pictures, birthdays, anniversaries. Paula, Paula, Paula! No matter how fat I am, you don't notice me! But I'm still here. This is how I feel. Why didn't you ever say anything? Why have I never said anything? You really don't understand anything, do you? Here, these are my drugs. The morning-after pill. To finally get rid of it, that thing inside me. Won. "Good morning, today is October 9th, 2015. The next beep is 11:45 minutes and 30 seconds." Sorry my angel. That's it. Not with me. Not with me. Edith? What's that about? What do you do? Careful please. You didn't say anything at all. It's all in the letter. But now everything is different. I survived. Let's try again. I don't want that, sorry. Someday we would be back where we are now. We are who we are. You can't understand. I was already dead And now I'm back. I am reborn again. It's a tacky joke, Paul! Do you want to change like that? You are afraid of life as it is! Paula's death was also a missed opportunity. Edith, please, I faced death and won. I don't think you know what that means. Lohman! What? What? What is it? That too? What? Uh yeah, uh no, I... Edith! Please listen to me. I understood everything. You're right about all things life and death. Be quiet! Shut up and let me go. Stupid angel! "Everyone can determine their own life." Crap! Holy shit! I never had a chance "Lohmann, that's it. They didn't appear on Tool Tiger. Get your papers and fast!" Disappears! Get away, you stupid critters! What else do you want from me? What is there to stare at?! Or are you deaf? Disappears! Go away! Hey! Hey! Here. Pulling up! Ah! You can't be left alone once. All right, let's go. As? You won. All of a sudden? Now that the shit's hitting the fan. I've tried everything, God knows. He doesn't know. You wanted to turn the corner! I'm just going in circles. Now it's done. Scythe. Nope! Do you know what shit you've done? Come on, I'll show you. Come! Come on! He had an accident in the tunnel. And you drown. I saved the boy. You messed everything up. I'm in the devil's kitchen! You're the stubborn buck I've ever had. That is a compliment. If you're a real guy you get everyone out of the shit I've already tried everything. What else? (How simple is life, is death, is resurrection, even the Ascension.) (When we have explored and accepted our limits, then we know who we are.) (Assuming that interests us.) Morning! Morning. Morning. Breakfast is ready. Do sit down if you like. Thanks. Where's my tobacco? Just with the fruit. Huh? Did I miss something? Is today World Education Day? All or nothing. But I paid for it. Bye! Muesli? Yes, something different. Do you want me to take you into town later? Thanks. These are the documents Baumarkt Autobahnkreuz and Tool Tiger. This is your job now. If you want. Yes. Yes, of course. Uh, thanks. Everything is in there, orders, prices, contact persons. Do better than me. I don't care about your sick children. That's why you have your wife. I'll pay you, so you have to be on time. Roger that? Out! Hush, hush! N / A? Another joke? Oh, boss... you are such a poor pig. What did you say? You are a poor pig. Believe me I know what I'm talking about. You're totally insane. Putting your people down to feel good. You're really going crazy, aren't you? I quit. No, I'm terminating you! Too late, boss. A copy is already in the HR department. Lohman! You just don't have it. So don't go out here! Come back! What is there to stare at? ...really embarrassing. What are you doing here? Do you have a moment? Nope. Please. What is? If you have something to say, you can do that here too. Sonja, your mother and I are going to separate. And I guess I'm not the only one who knows why. Something else? Yes, but yours must... Anything else? I cheated on mom. Yes, I am not interested. This is your beer. No matter what you think of me: I love you. You can do what you want. Oh Jutta... Nine years... Maybe you should tell her the truth about me. And what is the truth? That I'm a coward That I was a coward. All the years. It was just too big for me, too... too powerful her death. That I... didn't find an answer. When she died there... so I gave up. I'm sorry my little one! Forget keys? Why pigeons? Yes? Mmm. Alright, my girls. Here we go. So why pigeons? Because they always find their way back. To where they belong. Nice. Yes. They were the only thing my father left me. I've given up everything I ever wanted to do. I helped him make ends meet. And what does he do? Leave me pigeons. I really cursed him, your grandpa, back then. But now... sometimes I catch myself how to talk to my deaf And this isn't even the worst of times. Are you doing me a favor? Mmm. I'd like to say something. Can you record this? Clear. Yes? My name is Paul Lohmann... Do you have? Everyone back. This is the youngest. Do you want some? Mmm. I didn't want my champion anymore to her mother, it was an accident. You know it? Yes, the nausea every morning... I just do not know what to do. A child? Now? That would ruin everything. Not if you do it better than me. But if you're not looking forward to it at all... It's just too early. OK. Sonja? Does he already know? And mom? Do you want me to talk to her? OK. Morning. Morning. Have you already told me her...? Equal. Morning. Morning. What's the matter with Sonya? She just said "good morning". She is pregnant. And is that what she tells you? It was an accident, she says. And she doesn't want to have the child - it's her right. That's your decision. Bye. Bye. Bye. Yes, Paul, I... It's okay. You're right. We're not happy anymore. You haven't for a long time. And that's my fault. I'm sorry. I didn't realize that when love was gone. But I know one thing. I loved you. I know that for sure. We'll get through the breakup. I promise you that. And this time I hold it too. I still have to go to the pigeons. You already have food. Sonya... This is my daughter. She'll take care of you from now on. Hey! Disappears! No games here! What do you want? Yes nothing. Just pay attention! Father! What about dad? He had an accident. Where is he? Sonya! Where is Dad? The injuries were too bad. I need to inform two colleagues who will verify my diagnosis. What does that mean? His organs are working, but... his brain is dead. That means I have to decide whether his organs are donated? Yes. No. My name is Paul Lohman. I want that in case of my death my organs are donated. Do you have? Far away. Yes. And you? Just a few more kilometers. Aha. Didn't you ever want to go far? But, already. Clear. But I'm who I am now. Paul Lohman. Good to meet you, Paul Lohmann. Yes, this is my life here. As is. That's what it's about, isn't it? Yes. From the beginning. That's what it's about. Get out? Toss your coin. Number: I'm staying. You knew about the fake coin? All? You wouldn't be here otherwise. You're not giving up. Who gives up is dead. You should bury your father's old sayings. It's never too late to cut off old braids. Goodbye. He squeezed my hand. These are muscle contractions. That's not unusual. He squeezed my hand. Ms. Lohmann, believe me. Wait a moment. What is he doing here in my place? What are you doing here? Hey! There's still life.
