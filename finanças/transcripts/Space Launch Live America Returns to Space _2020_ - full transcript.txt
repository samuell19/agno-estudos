From the Kennedy Space Center, America is blasting off into a new age of space exploration. For the first time ever, American astronauts will be launched on a privately owned spacecraft, the thrilling countdown to this historic event begins right now. Counting down. Hello and welcome to what is truly a momentous day* in the history of our space program and in space exploration. This is unprecedented, for the first time in nearly a decade, American astronauts will be launched into orbit from American soil. And for the first time ever, they'll be traveling on a privately owned reusable American space craft, their state of the art transportation, the crew Dragon capsule atop the cutting edge reusable SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will take them to the International Space Station. To get there, they'll orbit the Earth gradually reaching the same altitude as the International Space Station and then rendezvous. Most importantly, this is the first time ever NASA astronauts will travel aboard a spacecraft not made by NASA, but by entrepreneur Elon Musk and his forward thinking team at SpaceX. He's in launch control now and no doubt these are anxious final moments for him after an 18 year journey to get to this day. For the past nine months, we've been granted unrivaled access to this mission. We've got views inside SpaceX that you won't see anywhere else, we've got to know our astronauts, Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken and you'll hear what they have to say and see them training for this historic flight. And we've got the only interview with Elon Musk, plus we've got exclusive access at the legendary Kennedy Space Center where you see the rocket on the pad right now. There in Florida, we're inside firing room four at NASA's launch control. We're also inside SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California. Now, just as our courageous astronauts have been doing for the last several weeks in preparation for today's launch, we are practicing proper social distancing. I'm here in our studios in Burbank, California and giving us his insight from one of our exclusive locations at Kennedy Space Center is my co-host, author of The Space Barons and reporter from the Washington Post, Christian Davenport. Also ion Cape Canaveral, Florida where today's launch will take place, former senior transportation correspondent for ABC News, David Kerley is standing by to bring us all of the action. And we also have an all star line up with guests including celebrity superfans like Katy Perry and Adam Savage who will be joining us throughout the day. Now before David sets the scene for us down in Florida, a bit of background on this historic mission. We are a nation of explorers, we're also a nation that leads. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard. And this time when we leave we're doing it differently than we've ever done it before. Ignition, lift off. Today's monumental launch will usher in a new era of space travel that starts in lower Earth orbit but will eventually take human beings as far as our wildest dreams can carry us. It's just one step on this longer road to creating a mass transit system for people to other planets. This is an experiment to see if a disruptive private company such as SpaceX can fly NASA astronauts and reinvigorate space exploration. We wanna enable a, a base on the moon and ultimately a city on Mars that is self sustaining. This is very important for the future of humanity. SpaceX knew that to revolutionize space exploration they would have to reduce the cost of access to space and the key was the development of reusable rockets. Most people thought it impossible, but SpaceX proved that they were up to the challenge. What SpaceX has done is developed a rocket that can be reused, its first stage booster delivers its payload to orbit. UNSURE OF WORD preparations burnt. Then it flies back and lands on land or at a ship at sea. We need to make sure that we are constantly pushing the envelope, constantly moving forward technology. I've heard it described as you standing on the top of the Empire State Building and you drop a pencil off and you have to land the pencil on its eraser on a postage stamp. When we're able to fly rockets, land them and reuse them, that means we can access space on a weekly basis versus like a monthly or yearly basis. Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken will be the first astronauts aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule. I don't generally get nervous but when I start thinking about this mission I actually get quite nervous about it. But we've done everything we can to ensure their safety and their health and make sure that they come back to their families. So in this very challenging time when we launch to the International Space Station something we haven't done from American soil since 2011, I do think that it gives people an opportunity to dream big and to look up and to know that we can do stunning things and it gives people hope, not just to the United States of America but throughout the entire world. It's a scary thing to be launching people, you know and risk is never zero. Sometimes things do blow up. Space is hard. How do you manage telling your son that you facing that risk as you go forward? The second golden age ... - Three ... - ... of space travel ... - ... two ... - ... begins ... - ... one. - ... now. And this is a proud day for NASA's commercial crew program and a make or break day for SpaceX. Right now let's check in with the man who literally wrote the book on both, Christian Davenport of the Washington Post. Christian, we're witness to a new era of human space flight, talk to me about the specifics of today's mission. Yeah, Chris it's a big day here today, if this launch goes off we're gonna see that Falcon 9 rocket light all nine of its merlin engines, lift off from iconic pad 39A, propel that second stage with the spacecraft with Bob and Doug inside, on their way to the International Space Station. And then we're gonna get a little bit of a treat because SpaceX does things differently, that first stage rocket is gonna reorient itself, fly back down to Earth, land on a ship at sea, meanwhile the second stage is gonna take off, continue on to the Space Station and really that's the main goal here today, to get Bob and Doug out to the Space Station safely and then eventually bring them back. Great insight there Christian and amazing technology of course, stick around we are gonna see you soon. I'd now like to go to David Kerley who is also standing by, David please bring us up to speed on the type of day the astronauts have had so far. I will Chris, let me tell you right now we are talking about the weather, we are under a tornado warning right now, you can look behind me and you can see pad 39 and you see the clouds. Doug and Bob are up in the capsule right now and we're hearing them talking to them doing a comms check right now. But it's an amazing day so far, you know we've seen a lot of rehearsals but today we saw for the first time Doug and Bob in the suit up room actually getting their SpaceX suits on and checking them. You can see the techs that are working with them, they are actually strapped into seats just like the ones in the capsule and they go through making sure that everything's working. There's Doug Hurley giving us a little bit of a wave and then you're gonna see a thumbs up from Behnken as well as they're checking everything out and ready to go. Now there is an iconic shot that after they get this look, they, they actually had a little meeting with Elon Musk there on the right and Jim Bridenstine on the left and then this iconic shot, there it is, they come out of the building and wave and this is their last chance to actually see their families. But they're social distancing, so there's Bob Behnken waving to his wife and six year old boy and Doug Hurley waving to his ten year old boy, those were virtual hugs they were giving them, waving to everybody else, Vice President Pence was there. Once they're in the Tesla Model X's, the kids could get up to the window and say goodbye. Very emotional moment actually to watch them do this, then the two Teslas take Doug and Bob out to the pad, this is them arriving there. There was a shot, there it is, of them looking up, having to lean back in their suits and see the top of that Falcon 9 and the Crew Dragon at the top, they take the elevator all the way to the top, then here they are coming out getting ready to get in. They have gotten into the capsule and they are testing everything right now Chris. David, thank you so much, those are amazing shots and we'll be back with you in just a bit as well. Now today's groundbreaking mission has attracted the attention of the entire world including the eyes of some pretty famous faces like our next guest. She is no stranger to simila ... simulated space flight, check this out, there is Katy Perry as the moon person hosting the MTV video music awards and she is joining us now. Katy, thank you so much for being here, I know you're a super fan of the space program, how excited are you for today's launch? Well I'm very excited, I'm nervous, I was thinking about Elon and all the SpaceX people and Bob and Doug and I was thinking about Elon has just had a child so he's not sleeping but did he sleep at all? I barely slept last night, I tossed and turned because what's about to happen is going to make history and be a great day for America and space travel and NASA and SpaceX. I'm just excited for it to start. Absolutely, now Katy a few years ago you learned all about NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover which has spent more than 2,700 days exploring the red planet. What do you think about Elon Musk's goal to some day colonize Mars? Well, I am, you know, in agreement that we, we definitely need to have a plan B especially after all we've been through lately. But will there be WiFi and will it be too hot? Those are two very, - very cogent considerations. - Those are my main concerns Yeah, definitely. Katy, we're thrilled that you're gonna be - back with us again - I definitely will need some snacks throughout the broadcast. Yeah, definitely bring snacks. Now we're a nation of explorers, it's part of the DNA of our country and to pioneer today's mission, NASA has selected two fearless voyagers who have already paid their dues in space. Their first hand knowledge of what it takes to survive outside of the Earth's atmosphere was instrumental in the creation of the first ever Crew Dragon capsule. That first flight is something you dream about as a test pilot. Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are super experienced pilots and astronauts. I did fly on the space shuttle previously, I flew a couple of missions. I flew on STS-135, the last shuttle flight and then before that STS-127. - Hi Doug. - Hey Doug. Never flown in space together and that's what's really exciting, we kinda know each other's moods and strengths and weaknesses and we try to compliment those. Bob and Doug both served in the military and then were in the same astronaut class at NASA in 2000. Not only that, but they actually met their wives in that same astronaut class. That's Megan McArthur who his our flight engineer. Astronaut, Karen Nyberg blasted off for her mission aboard the International Space Station. Having spouses that are astronauts that have been through what we're going through that kinda recognize that there's long days that are involved and they appreciate that aspect of it. Just make sure the backups are doing their job. They're not all that bad. They understand the ups and the downs, they understand thee risk, it just makes it a lot easier in some respects. We both have young boys that are in elementary school and so I'm really excited to be able to share this with my son. He understands that rockets are dangerous and he first said, "You can't fly on that rocket." And we had to get him over kind of that, you know, the emotion that goes along with riding on a rocket ship and getting him comfortable with that. But we went through the process of taking him to Florida, watching a rocket launch, he was ready for me to go and idea was that I would go on the first one, mommy would go on the second one but he needed a chance too for the third one. As we get ready to fly two humans to space, Bob and Doug, for the first time in our history we often refer to them as these two fathers, right, they were these, these two people who have families. It's something that we take very, very seriously, we wanna make sure that everything we do is right and that we're gonna bring them home safely. You know Bob and I are extremely excited to kind of put Dragon through its paces in space and by the way, this is as excited as Bob gets so, so this is ... it's gonna be fun. Oh that's great stuff there and joining me right now is a man who knows a lot about what Bob and Doug are going through at the moment he is former NASA shuttle astronaut and Columbia University professor, Mike Massimino. Mike thanks for joining us and you are the first man to Tweet from space, that's pretty cool. Now we talk about Doug and Bob as fearless test pilots, veteran shuttle astronauts, but you know them as humans, you know them quite well for the past 20 years actually. What are these guys really like? I've known these guys a long time Chris, thank, thanks for having me here on the broadcast, they're both great guys. Doug Hurley who's nickname is Chunky, that's what I ... we all call him, Chunky's a kind of a fun guy to be around, he's always got something to say, always seems to be high energy, I love flying in a jet with him on our training jet, just a fun guy to be around. Bob's a really good guy, he's kind of on the quiet side but he can sneak up on you 'cause he's also really fun, he's got a great sense of humor, kinda guy you entrust your life with. Now I wrote these guys some notes just like a, a day or two ago to wish them luck, I told them I was gonna be part of this broadcast and they have a message for us. This morning, Doug Hurley sent me a note that he wanted me to share with the audience and what he said was, 'the message from us is to hugely thank the literally thousands of people from SpaceX to NASA, past and present who worked on this vehicle. Their long hours and hard work over the last six years is why we are here today.' And to me that kinda gives you a sense of what these guys are about, they're hard workers, they're very competent in what they're doing, great guys but they're also very appreciative, have a lot of gratitude for the opportunity that they have today. Absolutely, alright let's talk a little bit about today's mission, you know it, what goes through your mind sitting on the pad waiting for lift off? It's, you know, you're finally there, it's, it's game time, they've been waiting for years working hard, helping the SpaceX engineers get the vehicle ready, long hours, time away from home and now all that comes in the past and right in front of them is the adventure of a lifetime. So they're very focused, probably kidding around with each other, maybe telling a couple of jokes, maybe one game of tic tac toe, but they're really focused on getting off the ground and very excited. So Mike you launched on the space shuttle, this is a space capsule, how have things changed since you flew on the shuttle? Yeah it's, it's absolutely amazing Chris, everything looks so much different to me, looks like we are really in the 21st century, you know, the, the shuttle, we had these big bulky orange space suits, they got these sleek looking ones with these cool helmets. They're getting to drive out there in a Tesla, we went like in an old Airstream but it was kinda cool, it was very nostalgic but there, everything about it is the pad, I've been on that launchpad, launched from it twice, 39A, looks completely different, absolutely completely different now. We're ready, we're ready for the 21st century and beyond with this new spacecraft. Mike, thanks for joining us, stick around 'cause we're gonna get back to you a little bit later - in the broadcast. - My pleasure, you bet. Lets check in with David Kerley at Kennedy Space Center, the site of today's launch. David, do you have an update? I wanna show you the astronauts actually getting into the crew capsule, this happened just a few minutes ago and Doug Hurley who's the commander on this mission was the first to go in and you can see him there as Bob Behnken is standing by next to him and there's a four person SpaceX crew wearing those kinda cool looking black uniforms to get them in there. This is called the White Room because it's painted white, that started way back in the early days of NASA but it's also kind of a clean room to a certain extent because they are really worried about the potential of the astronauts carrying something to the Space Station, including Covid which is completely changed everything about the way this mission has put together. There are no people here watching this, there normally would be like hundreds if not thousands of people behind me on the lawn here looking out at pad 39, nobody has been allowed to come onto the base and they have asked Floridians and others to stay away if they can. There are some VIP's here, the Vice President was there as the astronauts got into their Tesla to head out to the launch pad. The President is in Air Force One and on his way down here. Chris. Thanks for that David. And joining us now to talk about the exciting role SpaceX is playing in this historic launch is the original mythbuster the one and only Adam Savage. Now Adam, you're known for your one day builds, let's talk about the speed of innovation at SpaceX, they see it, they build it, they send it into space. It might not be one day, but how impressed are you with the speed at which they build, test and fix? I am super impressed but, like really to be clear, they've spent over a decade and a half on this problem, they have some of the best people in the world thinking in the most innovative ways. I ... everything SpaceX does feels like a science fiction movie to me, watching those, those rockets land themselves, I'm just, I'm really, really excited about what they've, what they've got done and about today. Adam, why is today so important, especially with everything that's going on in the world right now? Yes, well especially because of everything that's going on in the world right now, we need stories about how amazing human beings are when they collaborate and get together to do things that seem impossible. Going to the moon was impossible when Kennedy tasked us with doing it in the early 60's and the Dragon capsule reaching the ISS is a story of human ingenuity, of collaboration and that is actually what's gonna get us out of this terrible pandemic right now. Adam, we will see you soon. Right now let's head back to David Kerley at Kennedy Space Center. David, talk to me about mission safety. Now this of course is space travel and there are a lot of risks involved. If they have a problem there are two ways to get out of there, they can get them out of the capsule if they have time and then they actually transit to what's a zip line of sorts that they get in and actually zip line down away from the launch pad and all that rocket fuel, all that explosive potential and waiting for them on the ground is an MRAP which is a military armored personal carrier that will carry them further away. Now if there's a problem that they don't have time to get out of the capsule there is on this vehicle a launch escape system, seven superdraco engines that are built into that capsule and if they need to go then those will fire. And we saw this in a demonstration earlier this year, it's an amazing picture, you see it getting like an ejection seat, being pulled away. That explosion was the rocket actually exploding because it was no longer aerodynamically feasible. It's an amazing system that can actually pull them away from the rocket from launch to orbit and there weren't a lot of capsules that could have that advantage, that's one thing that Elon Musk is very proud about his Crew Dragoon capsule, they can actually get them some place away from that rocket very quickly. Of course if they do do that, if there is an abort, then they've gotta find them in the Atlantic Ocean, up and down the east coast and that's one of the reasons that the go or no-go will be about the weather, not just here but up and down the east coast. That's a lot of, of considerations to get this thing up into the air. Chris. Thanks David, yeah that escape hatch is really amazing, it is the final, final safety measure in case something goes wrong on the past. David Kerley there at Cape Canaveral, we'll be back with him again soon for another update. Now, two of the key pieces of safety equipment Doug and Bob will be relying on will be their high tech space suits. Today's mission will mark the first time these sleek, futuristic looking suits will be tested in space by humans. The suit's been in development for over five years, we've been integrating on the design with the astronauts as well. One of the unique parts about this suit is that it's a one piece suit, so everything is connected; the boots, the gloves, the helmet, that way the crew isn't looking for different parts of their suit, it's all right there for them to quickly get in. The helmet's 3D printed and it has a visor that can articulate open, so the crew can be in their suit and still open their visors during some parts of the mission. The crew gets into this suit through what we call the in-seam zipper, so it's a zipper that runs from the ankle to the ankle and it runs up along the leg and then there are additional zippers on the sides of the gloves here so that you can be barehanded up until the very last thing you would do putting on this suit is to put your hands in the gloves and zip up those zippers as well. The Dragon spacesuit is not to do space walks, that space suit is really to protect you from a depressurization. Pressure suits are a bit cumbersome, even these suits, albeit are a lot more comfortable and a lot lighter, a lot easier to get in and out of than the ACES suits we wore in shuttle. In the event that something's wrong with the rest of the capsule's atmosphere, that space suit is your little, little capsule that you can go inside and kinda hibernate in to finish out the mission. The outer layer is designed to be flame resistant to protect the crew in the unlikely event of a fire, so the white is a material called PTFE or more commonly known as Teflon and the gray is our different versions of Nomex which is a fire resistant material that's often used in firefighter suits for example. The gloves are also flame resistant but the leather that's used on the fingertips works with the touch displays inside of the capsule. Now there is another super fan with a space suit in her collection who is known not just for her hit music but also for her bold style, of course I am talking about Katy Perry who is joining us once again. Katy, the new, the new suits aren't as flashy as your moon person outfit but what do you think, runway worthy? I think they're absolutely elegant and beautiful and I agree, they are the definition of the future now, but my dog Nugget here has a little space suit of her own that she's wearing, she's participating in this launch as well so she's ready to go. But I'm so excited for these suits, they look absolutely comfortable, they look, like an incredible feat of engineering and know that they're gonna keep these astronauts safe and that is the most important part. I'm such a huge fan of the space program, huge fan of NASA huge fan of SpaceX and huge fan of Elon, I mean I've been a fan of, you know, just the idea of traveling to space for over a decade. I had a ticket to space, I still have a ticket to space with Richard Branson but I am happy to transfer that over to SpaceX when that starts happening. Katy, appreciate you checking back in, stick around 'cause we're gonna come back to you again a little bit later in the broadcast. And an exclusive interview with Elon Musk is on the way, Adam Savage and Mark UNSURE OF WORD return as we take a look inside the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. Plus more from Katy Perry, stick around. We are only an hour and 19 minutes away from witnessing history. The launch of two American astronauts above, aboard a privately owned spacecraft. Christian Davenport of the Washington Post joining me once again, Christina please summarize the mission for us. Yeah Chris, I mean obviously the stars of today are the astronauts, Bob and Doug, but hopefully we're gonna get to see a real performance by that Falcon 9 rocket when it takes off from 39A. Nine merlin engines firing all at once to get that spacecraft and that second stage into space, into orbit so that that spacecraft can ultimately then meet up with the international space station at some point tomorrow. The space station traveling at 17,500 mph, the, the stages will separate, the second stage will keep going, it'll light its engines and then at about T plus 12 minutes the Dragon spacecraft will separate and take Bob and Doug on their way to the space station. That first stage, remember we've been talking a lot about it, will fly its way back and land on the landing pad. Christian, let's talk about what this launch means to SpaceX and what it means to the United States. Yeah you're absolutely right, this is a huge launch for SpaceX, they've never flown people before and now they're gonna be flying NASA's astronauts because right now, NASA cannot fly astronauts anywhere. It relies on Russia to fly American astronauts to the Space Station, that costs us about $85 million a seat, so they're hoping that Elon and the private sector will take over that. Chris. Appreciate that Christian, looking forward to seeing more of your exclusive interview with Elon Musk, that's coming up. Now let's head back down to David Kerley who is also on site there, David what have you got for us. Back behind me there you can see pad 39A, that's where the Crew Dragon capsule, aboard which Doug and Bob will be headed up to the Space Station marking a crucial milestone. Now it's kind of interesting that a look at this groundbreaking spacecraft that probably only Elon Musk and his crew at SpaceX could've designed. The Dragon spacecraft is really a 21st century spaceship. It's beautiful inside, it's incredibly functional and it's very, very safe. The Dragon capsule is 16 ft tall, 13 ft in diameter and can carry up to seven people. The Crew Dragon spacecraft has two types of engines on board, the first are 16 draco thrusters, those are small engines that make about 100 lbs of thrust. And those engines are what we're gonna use to maneuver and dock to the International Space Station. And then there are eight superdraco engines for a launch escape scenario in an emergency situation which make thousands of pounds of thrust. My first impression of the inside of Crew Dragon, I was amazed, it's obviously a modern space vehicle, it's a very sleek design inside, very comfortable, flat screens, the seats are actually heart racing seats so the safety factors go up considerably. SpaceX Dragon successful read, check. Some of the great innovations that we've made, we have wonderful touch screens so you can see everything that's going on in the vehicle, you can get all the data that you need about the vehicle and you can also control the vehicle all from these touch screens. SpaceX Dragon we've got two good LED's. Copy all Dragon. The interior of the Dragon capsule, it does draw a lot from the Tesla, I think maybe some of the display content or at least the display themselves. It's exciting to see, you know, modern components in a spacecraft. The Dragon is almost completely automated so it should be able to fly the entire flight without us intervening at all. I'm pretty excited to have a chance to fly on a brand new spacecraft, proud to be a part of a, a new ship that's gonna bring back that mission of taking crews to the Space Station. Throughout NASA's history, rockets have been extremely expensive and used only once, whereas Christian Davenport has said it's like flying across the country from New York to LA and then throwing away the plane, doesn't make sense. The key to efficiently traveling to space is to reuse and SpaceX thinks they've' figured it out. We have lift off at the UNSURE OF WORD . What SpaceX has done is developed a rocket that can be reused, its first stage booster delivers its payload to orbit. State separation UNSURE OF WORD . Then it flies back and lands on land or at a ship at sea. I've heard it described as you standing on the top of the Empire State Building and you drop a pencil off and you have to land the pencil on its eraser on a postage stamp. Ultimately it's not beyond the realm of physics and if it's not beyond the realm of physics there's an engineering way to get it done. To bring Falcon 9 back to Earth we've got a navigation system in the first stage. Most first stages don't have that. The Falcon 9 rocket is composed of two main parts called the first stage and the second stage. What it does, after letting go of the second stage is flips itself around, starts its engines back up and the whole first stage is re-entering the Earth's atmosphere and slowly making its way back down for a landing. Currently the Falcon 9 is designed to be flown ten times, each time we do a refurbishment, what we call vehcile maintenance. This is launch complex UNSURE OF WORD , this building houses and processes Falcon 9's that have landed at our landing pads or have been landed on the drone ships. To refurbish a rocket they roll into the hanger, we load them into their processing rings and it's a matter of weeks to process them and get ready for launch. Re-usability is incredibly important to space exploration, if every time you had to build a new vehicle we would be waiting and waiting and waiting for a new rocket to be produced. But when we're able to fly rockets, land them and reuse them, that means we can access space on a weekly basis versus like a monthly or yearly basis. The end goal is obviously to have zero refurbishment, to be able to land and then relaunch like airplanes to ensure that we're able to access space on a daily basis. Truly incredible the way that they can do that, now former astronaut Mike Massimino is back to weigh in on the importance of these reusable rockets. Mike, the space shuttles that you flew on were designed to be reused, how does the Falcon 9 take re-usability to the next level? It's a good point Chris, we did have a reusable rocket ship with, space ship with the space shuttle, the space shuttle would come back and land on a runway whereas the SpaceX vehicle can ... will land in the ocean. Part of the problem we thought about weather is that they need good weather for them to be able to recover the spaceship if they have an abort up the coast. Well for us with the shuttle, we needed goo weather to get to a runway, I got delayed in space for two extra days on my second flight because the weather was bad in the Kennedy Space Center and we had to come back at the, at the Edwards Air Force base. So reusable on a runway, the SpaceX vehicle reusable, lands in the ocean, the rockets, the boosters you talked about the different stages of the rockets, with the space shuttle we had solid rocket boosters, kind of like giant sticks of dynamite, they can be packed with solid rocket material. They were recoverable, they would leave the vehicle after about two and a half minutes, splash down in the ocean, a recovery ship would go get 'em, bring 'em back to the Kennedy Space Center, put 'em on a train to go to Utah to get re, re-packed and then the train would bring 'em back to the Kennedy Space C Enter. What SpaceX does is they fly the vehicle, the, the stage which is what you've, you've been explaining, first they had it come back to the Kennedy Space Center, now they have it go back to a ship in the ocean, so it flies its way back, easier to recover, get it very ... much more quickly back to the Kennedy Space Center, refueled right there. So they've taken it to the next level and I'll tell you what Chris, when they came and briefed us about what SpaceX had in mind when I was in the astronaut office, you know, ten, 12 years ago I thought this was crazy, how are they gonna do all this stuff, I wasn't really sure they could get it done. But after seeing them land the upper, the first stage of their vehicle on a platform in the ocean, that was all the credibility I needed. I, I'm a total believer in what they're able to do, an amazing company. Mike, thanks for joining us, stick around, when we come back we'll talk with astronaut Jessica Meir who just got back from the International Space Station. Plus, our exclusive interview with Elon Musk, stick around. Right now we wanna welcome astronaut Jessica Meir, she knows exactly what it's like to experience the excitement, the majesty and the weightlessness of space. In fact she just returned from Doug and Bob's destination, the International Space Station. Jessica, welcome, 205 days in space, 86.9 million frequency flier miles, part of the all female space walk in history, welcome back to Earth, first of all how are you feeling? Thank you so much Chris, I'm feeling really good, I have to say but I'm also pretty jealous of Bob and Doug right now 'cause I'd much rather still be floating. Now logistically you took off on a Russian rocket and then landed in Kazakhstan, why is the return of our ability to fly US astronauts from American soil so important to you and so important to the program? Well first of all more vehicles we have that are capable to get humans to space, the more access we have for everybody on the planet. This will be the second INAUDIBLE , second vehicle which can carry humans to the International Space Station, soon hopefully we'll also have a third. This means that we can continue to support all of the scientific experiments with the Space Station and continue our human presence in space. And of course lastly it is a huge measure of national pride to be launching from Florida space INAUDIBLE again. Jessica, we are glad you are back on Earth safe and sound and so happy that you could be with us on this incredible day, thank you very much. Now once in a generation, a visionary comes along unlike any other; Thomas Edison was one of those, Steve Jobs was, was one of those, we're talking about people who can look across the ocean, see beyond the horizon and know what society needs before society even knows it. One of those people also is Elon Musk, now where do these visionaries get their uncanny ability to know what the people of the world need before they know it? Well author of Space Barons, Washington Post Reporter Christian Davenport who we just heard from, practiced some cross country social distancing for this exclusive interview with Elon Musk in Hawthorne, California. So when you founded the company in 2002 did you imagine this day would, would come, I mean what is it like, you know that it's ... now its here, you know, we're gonna have human space flight? Well we've done everything we can to make sure that the rocket is safe and the spacecraft is safe, you know, where you're going 25 times the speed of sound, you're, you're circling the Earth every 90 minutes. It's just like a speed that's difficult for people to even comprehend, it's, I don't know, it must be close to 30 times faster than a, than a bullet from a handgun. One of the things that I always found so interesting about SpaceX is that your job is not just to create a multiplanetary species and lower the cost of human space flight, but also to inspire people and get people, like really fired up about the future. Yeah, absolutely, I really wanna get the youth excited about the future of space and get us thinking about the future in exciting ways, like that the, that the future is gonna be better than the past, that we'll be out there, a space fairing civilization. You know, having cities on Mars, have cities on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, ultimately going beyond the solar system to other star systems. I think the United States is a nation of explorers. Anyone with a spirit of adventure anywhere in the world, I think this is something that has gotta really appeal to, to people, you know, with a adventurous spirit. You know, UNSURE OF WORD from that is it's like you, you don't wanna truncate hope and so the possibility of being a space ranked civilization out there among the stars, it's very important to keep that, that hope alive. Talking about your design and the SpaceX aesthetic, I mean it, it's kind of like you're designing the future the way you want it to be. Yeah, it's very important that since it is the future that it look and feel like the future. And that seems exciting and appealing and you want kids to look at that space suit and say, I wanna wear that space suit one day. No it's gonna be exciting and I, I should've said earlier congrats on the baby, - that's awesome man. - Oh thanks, yeah sure, absolutely. Mars needs babies, Mars needs people and the moon . Mars needs babies, I love that. Alright, the anticipation for this epic launch is building inside mission control. As closely as the world is watching today's launch, there are two people who have a deeper, more personal reason for its success, they're veterans of the space program that astronauts Bob and Doug come from and we're talking about their wives, Karen Nyberg and Kay Megan McArthur. How do you like the food so far? Well so far all I've had is a peanut butter sandwich and that was tasty. We were all in the same class of astronauts in 2000 and we all started training together, but we also spent a lot of time as a group socializing together as lots of people do when they work for larger companies. We made sure that our boss knew that we were dating before he made his flight assignment so that he wouldn't accidentally assign us to the same flight. Once we had a child, certainly because of the risk we decided we absolutely did not want to be on the same flight. Our son was 18 months old when Doug flew on the last shuttle flight, so now he's ten and I, I anticipate that it really wont hit him until we get down to Florida and start seeing things in action. We did watch the Space Station go over last night which was really special, so Doug talked to him a little bit about the fact he was going to be living there and reminded him when he was three watching me go over. There are a lot of things of course that I love about Bob, his sense of humor I think partly because it's such a stealth sense of humor. Also he's a tremendous dad. I'm really excited to be able to share this with my son, he understands that rockets are dangerous and he first said, "You can't fly on that rocket." And we had to get him over kind of the, you know, the emotion that goes along with riding on a rocket ship and getting him comfortable with that. One of the hardest things to do is watch the person that you love launch into space, it's much harder than actually doing it yourself, it's hard for people like us who are used to being able to, you know, at least contribute if not control the situation. It can occupy your mind with all of the different possibilities that you know are out there. I think for me, when we watched them go through the process of getting on board and leaving crew quarters and all that, there will be a lot of pride for sure. I think there will be a lot of emotions and I don't even know if I could pinpoint what they'll be, they'll be, there will be a lot. I am proud of Doug all the time, I'm, I'm happy for him. This is kind of a dream assignment to fly a brand new vehicle in a test flight configuration. And I'm really looking forward to seeing them get to enjoy that success and that achievement once, once everything is mission complete. I certainly would be lying if I said it wasn't exciting, you know, as that clock counts down towards the launch the anticipation is incredible. I am humbled, honored, lucky to be just one small part of this, this mission. Hey Bob. Hey Doug. Good luck. Have fun. We're proud of you. Don't goon it up. Well Karen and Megan, very cool, calm and collected there, of course they're astronauts too so that's to be expected and I would like to bring in another one of our experts right now, former astronaut and Colombia professor, Mike Massimino. Mike, from your perspective you've been there before, it's almost go time, it's looking like the launch is a go, what is going through the minds of our astronauts, Bob and Doug right now? They're, they're pretty focused on getting off the ground, they're very excited about it I'm sure. I got a note from Bob's wife, Megan McArthur, very close friend of mine, you see this plaque over my shoulder, both Megan's name and my name are on that plaque, we flew together in space, she's, she text me last night and wanted everyone to know that the crew is in great spirits and ready to launch. They are absolutely 100% ready to go, but what's interesting here I think, we're all sharing this feeling of are we gonna go or not and it's a launch attempt. I actually told my guests when they were coming to Florida, plan a trip to Florida and maybe you'll see a launch 'cause you, 'cause you never know if, if, if, if you're gonna go and get off the ground or not and that's what we're experiencing now, whether other systems issues, luckily it's not a systems issue, the crew is feeling great, it's just a weather issue and hopefully that'll, that'll pass. Mike, please stand by, we've got another update from David Kerley, David what have you learned? Unfortunately some very bad news Chris for all of us who have been anticipating this for years, this launch has just been scrubbed, it has been canceled, they are aborting the mission at this point. So they are starting to de-fuel the spacecraft and we just heard from Doug Hurley, I heard him tell the crew, "Good effort by the team, we'll see you back at the NASA headquarters here just off of pad 39." So we will see the fuel come off and then the astronauts will come off, unfortunately they will not be going today, Chris. Like to bring back Mike Massimino for his expert opinion on this scrubbed mission. Mike you said earlier you've been here before, this is routine, that launches get scrubbed, safety is paramount, please give us your take on this unfortunate development. This is very disappointing for those guys, but they're professional about it, they know there's gonna be another day and it's really better to be safe. I always felt with delays was if you, if you get delayed by whatever, how long it is, people might remember, here, remember that was delayed a couple, a couple of months or a year, here we're talking just a couple of days. People might, probably not gonna remember a delay but they're certainly gonna remember an accident tor something bad happening, so we don't want that to happen, that's kind of the difference between launching a satellite and launching a spacecraft with people in it, you wanna make sure that, that it's safe. So I think, I think that the crew, although they're disappointed they know it's the right decision and they'll be ready to go again in a couple of days. Mike, very well said, so many things can go wrong and so you do not wanna take the chance, safety is paramount with this launch. And as Mike very well pointed out, no one's gonna remember a delay but they certainly will remember a disaster so we want to avoid that at all costs. So I have to ask you out there, what are you doing on Saturday? Wanna come back for our next launch attempt? I'll certainly be here, we hope that you will too. If you were with us earlier this week, welcome back for take two from Kennedy Space Center as America blasts off into a new age of space exploration. Today, for the first time ever, American astronauts will be launched on a privately owned spacecraft, the clock for this historic event has been reset, the thrilling countdown beings right now. Bob and Doug were strapped in moments ago starting to do their final check with launch control. Now they've got a long trip ahead, orbiting the Earth several times in order to reach the proper altitude to rendezvous with the International Space Station. Now to understand why we're back today, we had to take a look at the events of Wednesday and the reason the launch was scrubbed just 16 minutes before lift off. It's been an amazing day so far, we saw Doug and Bob in the suit up room getting their SpaceX's suits on, they come out of the building and wave and this is their last chance to see their families. Once they're in the Tesla Model X's the kids could get up to the window and say goodbye, very emotional moment. They have gotten into the capsule, the hatch has been closed. It is raining right now. We are under a tornado warning. The latest is a 50/50 chance of launch, the only thing they're concerned about right now is a cell that is over Orlando headed this way but they think it's actually gonna break up. So they started fueling right on time, even though the weather is iffy we are good to go. We just had a presidential motorcade come by where we are. American astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are going to make history here today we hope. We're all sharing this feeling of are we gonna go or not? Launch has just been scrubbed, it has been canceled. Well that was quite an ending to a dramatic day and bringing in Christian Davenport now, Christian, tell us what we've learned since we went off of the air on Wednesday. Yeah, what we learned Chris is that they're not messing around, safety's gotta be first, I mean they had the President here, they had all these VIP's, they had all this attention on the launch but the conditions were not safe, there was too much electricity in the atmosphere and so they called it and you know what, they may do the same thing today. As Deke Slayton, the famous astronaut and former crew mission manager said, "It's better to have a good scrub than a bad launch." Now I got a chance to talk recently with NASA administrator, Jim Bridenstine, he was in the middle of that decision, let's go have a look and see what he had to say about it. It went right up to almost T minus 17 minutes, looked like you guys were really working the weather, can you walk us through hat happened and the decision making process? Yeah so the, the challenge was, you know, we were in and out all day as it relates to electricity in the atmosphere and so we have a, a limitation, within 15 minutes of launch we have to have, you know, less than a certain threshold of electricity in the atmosphere, otherwise there is a risk that we could trigger lightening by launching and/or the rocket becoming a lightening bolt itself. And so, so we had to make a call 15 minutes ahead of time to, to delay the launch, I know everybody's talking about scrub, I wanna be really clear, we are launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil, that is going to happen, it didn't happen on Wednesday, it might happen this weekend. So that's what Jim had to say about that, about Wednesday's launch, we've got more weather today, it's currently drizzling on us right now. Another thing that's transpired since Wednesday is down at SpaceX's Boca Chica facility they were testing their next generation starship rocket, now let's be clear that rocket and that test had nothing to do with today, it's their next generation rocket they hope to take astronauts to the moon and Mars but it ended up blowing up on the launchpad, a spectacular fireball, that shows how SpaceX always is testing the limits but that's probably not the image that NASA wanted out right before they were gonna launch America's astronauts. We are now just about mmm, an hour or so away from the launch of the SpaceX demo two mission, the first ever launch of American astronauts from a privately owned spacecraft. And joining us again today, space shuttle astronaut and current Colombia University professor, Mike Massimino. Now Mike, you flew on the space shuttle with Bob Benkhen's wife, Megan McArthur and we know you've been in touch with her and of course you're close friends with Bob and Doug, so what did Bob and Doug have to go through to be ready for lift off and then disembark and head back in to quarantine? Well Chris, they, you know, they got to spend a little more time with their families which is always nice, I heard from Megan this morning so they got to do that the last couple of days, but they are ready to go and hope that they're gonna be able to launch. One thing they had to go through is that the tradition was with shuttle program, is that the commander of the spacecraft played a hand of poker with the chief of the office. And they kept playing until the chief of the office won, this way the commander left all of his bad luck on the ground and then he could leave for the launch pad, so that's another thing they had to accomplish today. That's a great story. Now Mike, I know that bringing launches back to the US means a lot to you personally, talk to me about that and what it must mean for the families of Doug and Bob as well. It, it, it's such ... becoming an astronaut is such a dream and then getting a chance to fly in space is another dream come true and you like to share with the people that you love. And that ... I, I'm very happy that we're moving back to the US to, to launch again because you can invite people and lots of people can come. It was more difficult for them to come to Kazakhstan to watch launching into space for the past nine years, so this is something that a lot of people can, can now participate in. We can't do it right now because of the pandemic, I had about 600 guests on my first launch, every, everyone from, like my elementary school teachers came to my neighbors, of course my family was there and so it's very meaningful to people to have this happen on the US again. And I'm sure that all of Bob and Doug's supporters are there with the in spirit, well thank you very much Mike, we'll be bringing you back into our coverage soon so please stand by. Now right now we wanna have a visit with the man who has the right outfit for every occasion, of course I'm talking about original Mythbuster Adam, welcome back I hear that you couldn't resist making a slight upgrade to one of your helmets since we saw you on Wednesday. Totally, I have an intimate relationship to a certain extent with every single one of these suits, they represent a part of my life and just seeing my ACES helmet again, I decided to go back in the inside and make the inside pieces and parts and connectors all way more accurate, I've been doing it for the last three days, I, I just can't stop, it's a sickness. Attention to detail is key. Alright, thanks Adam, we're gonna check back in with you again in just a bit. Hello, this is George W. Bush with a message for the teams at NASA and SpaceX; thank you for your work in bringing about a new era in human space flight. Your space craft and the commercial crew program are testaments to the ingenuity and determination of our great nation. To Bob and Doug, good luck. Lord, I send our best wishes to you and your families as you embark on this far reaching and important journey. May God bless you. Thank you for that sentiment President Bush and welcome back to Space Launch Live, lift off is now just about 49 minutes away and we're awaiting the critical moment when the SpaceX launch director verifies the go to load the fuel, that is a key moment and for more on that let's bring back Christian, David and Mike. Christian I wanna start with you, why is this particular fueling process unique to SpaceX? Yeah you're right Chris, I mean this is SpaceX, this is Elon Musk, they've gotta do everything differently, that's how they disrupted the entire space industry by innovating and iterating and their fueling process actually is a really good example of that. As David was talking about they take that liquid oxygen and super chill it, now that doesn't mean that liquid oxygen is really hip or really cool, it means it's really cold, -340 degrees Fahrenheit and when it's, it's at that temperature it becomes more dense, the more dense it is the more they can pack into that rocket, the more they can pack into the rocket the better performance they get out of it. That's important, not just for lift off because obviously that propellant is helping it get to orbit, but remember they then fly that booster back down to Earth and they need that extra fuel to be able to do that. They're gonna fire the engines twice, once during re-entry and then firing that engine one more time just before it lands on that ship at sea. Chris, back to you. Really interesting animation of the fueling process there, Christian thank you. David Kerley, please take us through the steps that we're about to see leading up to the launch. At T minus 35, they start loading the fuel, now they're gonna load what's called RP1, that's refined petroleum 1, it's rocket fuel, it starts out as diesel, they refine it, becomes jet fuel, they refine it even more and it's rocket fuel. So they'll load that in the first stage and the tank above it, a much bigger tank, is that liquid oxygen that Chris Davenport just told you about, it's super cool and super cold and you will see it, it starts to warm up in the rocket, they just can't keep it cold enough. And it'll start to condensate, you'll see that coming off, it's just oxygen, very normal. They are go for propellant no .. load, I just heard that, that's from the, the flight director, so it came a minute earlier, they are gonna go starting to put the fuel in. Now the next thing we're gonna watch is at about 16.5 minutes they'll have another chance where they will go no-go before they put liquid oxygen in the second stage tank. I just heard them say that they are ready and this is the, kind of the last visual cue that we are gonna see that the crew access arm can be retract now, so you'll see a shot here pretty soon from NASA and SpaceX of that access arm, the really sleek one that they walked down to get into that capsule's going to pull back. That's great, David Kerley and as we can see on our wide shot there, it looks like they have moved the crew access arm away from the rocket which is another good sign that we are going to have a launch today. And joining us again today is astronaut Jessica Meir, Jessica on Wednesday a lot of people were wondering, well why not just wait for a break in the clouds? I mean this mission has what's called an instantaneous launch window, tell us what that means and why it's important, why they just can't go whenever. Right, so of course the first thing to remember is that you're not just launching the spacecraft to get to space, the goal is to get to the International Space Station. So I got my globe here, if you think about the orbit of the Space Station being around the Earth and it is a moving target, Space Station's covering around the entire planet every 90 minutes. Now the Earth is also spinning below, so really to optimize UNSURE OF WORD and your launch capability you wanna be directly underneath the Space Station so you need to time both of those elements, taking into account the spin of the Earth and that the Space Station is a moving target. The second factor is as you were just hearing about the different fuel, the super cooled for the SpaceX vehicle and because as this fuel warms up, as the liquid oxygen warms up it becomes less dense, then it loses thrust capability and so they to reserve some in order to retain that INAUDIBLE as well as be able to easily project it, so those two factors make this an instantaneous launch window. Jessica, thank you so much for that, that was very well explained, appreciate that and let's not forget also that the International Space Station is traveling in orbit at 17,500 mph, it's just simply amazing. Now I wanna get back to Mike Massimino, Mike getting back to the launch itself, you described your shuttle launch as riding a beast, please describe that sensation of lift off. We can all talk about it, you've actually done it, tell me what that's like and how loud does it get? So what's gonna happen is they're gonna go down thorough their countdown, the beast that I referred to, the, the spacecraft, the rocket, will come alive, that beast looks very calm out there now, very peaceful but it's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna come alive pretty soon and when that happens the engines will fire up and they'll move, very quickly. You know you're going somewhere, 100 mph before you clear the tower, 0 - 17,500 mph in 8.5 minutes. On the shuttle we had solid rockets that we ... got shook around a lot, more than they'll get shook around but still, a lot of violence, lot of motion, G forces build up, last couple of minutes, about 3 G's of force hitting you right in the chest, it's kinda like you have three big dudes sitting on you. And then the engines cut and everything is peaceful and quiet and you're in space. Mike, thanks a lot for that information and just a couple of things to point out, I think I heard mission control say that they were gonna begin the fueling process, another great step towards having a go launch today. And also, Air Force One has just touched down at Kennedy Space Center, so the President will be on hand for today's launch as well. Now this is obviously dangerous business, exciting, yes, dangerous, definitely. The risk of an anomaly on the pad during fueling or during launch is very real, but SpaceX has built in some unique safety features to protect Doug and Bob from a catastrophe. We have main engine start, three, two, one and lift off. Lift off of the 25th space shuttle mission and it is clear of the tower. Challenger, go with throttle up. UNSURE OF WORD going to throttle up. January 28, 1986, it was a disaster that shook the foundations of our nation and still haunts NASA to this day. We watched the Space Shuttle Challenger blow up, a loss of the entire crew was a result of the fact that there was no launch abort system. The team at SpaceX is taking every measure possible to ensure that a catastrophic failure like that never happens again. The launch escape system on Dragon is how we save the crew. If there was a emergency on the pad or emergency on the way to orbit, the capsule's able to separate from the Falcon rocket. Think of sort of like an ejection seat on a jet, right, you wanna kinda get away quickly from something that's going wrong. If the computers sense a problem with the rocket, the spacecraft will automatically separate itself and fly through the air with it's superdraco engines, so that it can safely splash down in the ocean with it's parachutes and save the crew from an in-flight anomaly. To demonstrate the full functionality of the system, SpaceX had to destroy one of its own Falcon 9 rockets in the process. Three, two, one, zero. Ignition, lift off. Dragon launch escape initiated. Yeah! Dragon's away. During an escape they will likely pull between four and six G's, it depends on the different variables and the situations. I think it's really important than we retire as much risk as possible ahead of putting human lives at stake, so this is a big moment. Yes it's exciting, but more than anything it is still a first flight. That being said, as much risk as we can retire, space is always gonna be hard, that's something that our astronauts have taught us. Oh say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Who's broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight, o'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming. And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave. O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? Fantastic, thank you so much Kelly, even singing from home she sounds great. Bringing back in Christian Davenport, this is getting exciting man, what is the latest at Kennedy Space Center? You know, if you put a mic on the rocket Chris you could almost hear the rocket grunting and moaning and as it ... it's almost like hissing, it's about to coem alive in these moments leading up to the launch. Now right behind me is the famous firing room four where everyone in launch control center is getting ready to send this puppy on its way. Chris. It sounds like we were getting a little bit of natural sound from that fueling process, really amazing stuff and you can see from the shots there behind Christian that the weather seems to really be cooperating with us today. Thanks Christian, we'll be back to you very, very soon and joining us right now is former NASA engineer Mark Rober, who worked on the Mars Curiosity Rover and before I ask you to break down the science behind rockets, I hear that you actually included a little Easter egg, that is a hidden object on the CAD drawing that you did of the Rover, tell me about that Mark. Yeah so when I was at NASA, you know I'm working on the Rover so I had access to the CAD model, so I made like a photo realistic version of the Rover, complete with like a red laser and red rocks. The press loved it, it's like one of the top search sti ... results still if you search for Curiosity Rover, it's on the Wikipedia page, it was printed in text books. It wasn't until like a couple of months ago that I fessed up, I actually photoshopped Alf, the lovable alien from the TV show into the red rocks and so, you know, people are always looking for evidence of extraterrestrial life, turns out we've had evidence of aliens on Mars for like over a decade. You're bringing me back to my childhood with that Alf reference, now I guess we know where Alf is from. Alright Mark, now for the big one, how do rockets burn without oxygen in the vacuum of space? This is such a great question and an important UNSURE OF WORD question is like why don't we just use propellers in space? And the way to think about that is you know if you have a helicopter hovering, creates all this down wash, all this wind, well it's basically staying in the air by pushing down on all these air molecules. It's kind of like treading water in a pool, problem with space is there's no air molecules to push against so what do you do? Well I'll answer that with a riddle, let's say you're an astronaut, you're working on the Space Station, you look down and your tether is unplugged and you're sort of slowly drifting away from the Space Station, what do you do? You take that hammer, you throw it in the opposite direction you wanna move, Newton's Third Law, conservation of momentum says you're gonna equal opposite force in the other directions, back towards the Space Station. That's all rockets are, they're big metal tubes and they're just throwing hammers out the back, right. Now obviously it's a chemical reaction it's little particles but fundamentally a rocket is just throwing stuff in the opposite direction that you wanna move, that's why it can work in space in a vacuum with no ele ... air molecules even when propellers won't. You know we are so lucky to have guys like you because if it were up to guys like me, we would still be in the dark ages. Mark, really appreciate that information. We are just about ten minutes away from launch time, exciting right? I know you're not going anywhere so I don't have to tell you to stick around. We are now just about five minutes away from lift off, now on Wednesday the launch was scrubbed unfortunately but it's looking like it is gonna happen today, you just saw a picture of the President, he is on site here at Kennedy Space Center. We hear launch control continuing to communicate with Bob and Doug up in the Dragon Crew capsule. Dragon has transitioned to figure of a terminal count. Vehicle tanks pressing for strong bank retract. And of course are talking about the fueling process there that we are listening to also seeing and you can see stage two is being fueled now, that's the rocket that is directly beneath the Crew Dragon capsule and that means that the stage one, the Falcon 9 rocket has been fueled and now the stage two rocket is fueling. As we get down to one minute, we're gonna lay out, we're gonna listen to launch control communicating with Doug and Bob in the Dragon Crew capsule. Good luck gentlemen. Falcon 9 is in start up. Dragon is in countdown. FTS is on for launch. Dragon SpaceX, go for launch. T minus 30 seconds. Stage one, tanks pressing for play. T minus 15 seconds. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. This is lift off of the Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon, go NASA, go SpaceX, God speed Bob and Doug! Vehicle UNSURE OF WORD down range. Stage one propulsion is nominal. Falcon powering UNSURE OF WORD nominal. And 1D, throttle down. That throttle down call is because they are getting ready to the most aerodynamic stressful part of this flight, so they take the power down just slightly. And there is the 1,000 km/h mark, that 621 mph. And 1D throttle up. They're throttling up, there's max Q, the max aerodynamic pressure peak, the most mechanical stress on the rocket as I look up and we can still see the orange glow and I tell you what, it took five seconds for the vibration and sound from that lift off to affect us here. You can still see it just screaming almost straight up, even though they're pointing a little bit down range now. Start of MVAC engine two. Approaching rapidly 3,000 km/h, that is 1864 mph. And Chris, well you see that plume coming out of the back expanding, that's because there's, there's not as much atmospheric pressure on it, so that's why it expands out like that. And we are getting, that first stage engine's gonna fire for about another 20 seconds, 23 seconds or so. And Christian, that is really a step that we wanna pay attention to, that separation of the first stage that will then return back to Earth. Yeah we're gonna get very busy here in about five seconds, you're gonna see MECO, the main engine cut off and then you're going to see the separation and we're standing by for that. MECO. Falcon stage separation confirmed. So the main shut down and you see separation there too, that is the first stage falling away. So you're seeing in the first stage you can see those grid thins that you mentioned Chris Jacobs that will help guide it, but at 8:45, so plus 8:45 coming up in about two minutes you'll see three of those nine engines fire to slow it down. The first stage doesn't have any of that protection when it comes back into the atmosphere, so the, the way they overcome that is by firing the engines and slowing it down enough that when it re-enters the atmosphere it won't burn up and it'll be a 34 second burn of that entry stage of those three engines to bring us in. And seeing some of these pictures of Doug and Bob in the capsule is just remarkable, we haven't seen a lot of American astronauts live. And just to clarify, that picture of the left is the stage two rocket propelling the Crew Dragon capsule, the picture on the right is actually the stage one Falcon 9 rocket returning to Earth, so those are actually moving in opposite directions as we pass the 15,000 km/h mark which is approaching 9,400 mph. You know Chris, SpaceX would love to get this booster back and as we mentioned earlier they learn a lot when they get these rockets back and take a look at 'em. But it is secondary, that's the picture on your left, the second stage as Massimino said, that's what you wanna burn, you want that burn to go exactly as it should on the right trajectory. This was an instantaneous launch, they had to go at the right time, there's your start of the entry burn on the right, you're seeing it. Phase two FTS is saved. Yeah this slows it down, this is going for about 35 seconds as I mentioned, just to slow it down and if you watch those grid thins you can start to see them kind of move and that's what keeps this as we heard earlier in one of the pieces, you know, putting a ... landing a pencil, that's what keeps it north and south or up and down as it's coming down back in, in to land. And it is landing on a drone ship in the Atlantic. So that, that burn is over, the next thing we're gonna see at 9:27. MVEC UNSURE OF WORD . Everything's good they say, that's what ... those are the reports from mission control. So coming up in about a minute we'll see the final burn and as Davenport has told us before, you don't always get to see the landing because you know, got a camera that's getting shaken and, you know, this is a rocket actually that's coming back to there, you lost the pictures, that's, that's kind of what happens. And there's the 25,000 km/h which is 15,534 mph so again, continuing to accelerate as they make their way to orbit. MVEC shut down. There's the second stage engine cut off right there. That's good news Chris, that means that, that means that they've got their ... UNSURE OF WORD nominal orbital insertion. There they go. Launch escape system is disarmed. That's great news. And that's even better news, so they're in the orbit they're supposed to be in, they have just de-armed the escape system, they are where they're supposed to be at the right time and in a couple of minutes we will see separation of the Dragon and loss of that second stage. That's really good news and Chris, you asked a little bit about the atmosphere down here, there were some people here even though they didn't open the gates who were applauding as that Falcon 9 took off and really rattled our chests. And it looks like Falcon 9 has returned successfully to that drone ship, just amazing, amazing technology that that quickly, in under ten minutes, that Falcon 9 rocket has propelled Doug and Bob into orbit and has returned safely to it's drone ship. I mean hats off to SpaceX for developing that technology, truly incredible. Joining me right now is a man who knows a lot about what Bob and Doug are going through at the moment, he is former NASA shuttle astronaut and Colombia University professor, Mike Massimino. Mike just 11.5 minutes into their 19 hour journey, so a lot longer to go before they reach the International Space Station, what do they do now for the next 18 hours and 50 minutes? Yeah they get ready, you know they have to transfer through an orbital stage, we used to call it post insertion, I'm sure you still call it the same thing, there's usually no rest for the weary, there's plenty of things to do. They're gonna have to set up their cockpit so they can get ready to do their rendezvous, they're probably gonna get some rest coming up here I would think before they, before they do rendezvous, the final rendezvous and docking. Dragon separation confirmed. It's been a while since either of these guys have been in space, Doug, it's been almost nine years and, and, and Bob maybe just a little bit longer than that, I was a cab comm for his, his last flight so they've gotta get their space legs back and sometimes you don't feel as well as you'd like when you first unstrap because your, our body's getting used to it, your vestibular system is not working any longer. But I think these guys will probably be just fine. I understand that Bob and Doug have opened their visors inside the Crew Dragon capsule, I believe that gives them a view. Mike Massimino, I wanna bring you in 'cause you're the only one who knows first hand what they must be experiencing. What are they looking out on right now? Well that ... what you've ... what ... the thing you wanna do as soon as you get to orbit is unstrap and take a look, if you need to unstrap or look through the window you wanna take a look and look back at our beautiful planet, it is extraordinary. We can see pictures, we can see some high fidelity video but there's nothing like being there and actually seeing it and when I looked at our planet from space, what I thought to myself was, this must be what heaven looks like, it is an absolute paradise and you can look and see the blackness of, of space in the other direction, we've checked out the neighborhood, you realise we only have this one option, it's very fragile, you see that thin atmosphere. If you think of the Earth as an onion, the, the top layer, the top skinny layer of the, of the onion is the size relationship of the atmosphere of our planet through our planet, you see that, you can see that in these images. And you realise how lucky we are to be here and it changed my view of how I feel about our home, it's home we all share and it is an absolute paradise, so that's what they're looking at. And we're getting a really nice picture of that on our feed right now, I presume from where Bob and Doug are up on the Crew Dragon capsule. David Kerley, please weigh in, give us a sense of what it's like down there at Cape Canaveral, I mean of course relief, major joy, what's the feeling like right now? There's a delay, you know, the speed of sound is, is fast but it's not that fast and it, it took a while for the sound to hit us and then the vibration, that rocket fuel and oxygen when it's, when it's burning, it's just, you can feel it, it's just trying to rip the air apart. It was fantastic to see these guys get to the place they wanted to be at the right time they've done all that. Now it's a 19 hour journey to the Space Station and inside talked about it a little bit, they have specific things they are doing 'cause this, this is a test mission, they're going to make sure it's a habitable environment inside the capsule of Dragon. They're gonna try and eat, drink and as somebody at SpaceX said earlier, do whatever kind of bio work they have to do and then they wanna sleep. NASA wants them to sleep, everybody wants them to sleep, see if you can sleep inside this capsule. Thank you very much David Kerley, you know what, remember this day because you're gonna remember exactly where you were when SpaceX launched their Crew Dragon into space. May 30th, 2020, you're gonna remember this for the rest of your lives. Well today has given hope to every living soul who dreams of traveling throughout our solar system and beyond, I wanna thank all of our guests for sharing this unbelievable day with us, one that none of us will ever forget. Now, here are moments we'll be talking about for weeks and years to come, set to Katy Perry's Daisies. And from all of us, be safe, shoot for the stars. Goodbye everybody.
