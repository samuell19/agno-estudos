Rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub, Not for profit, not for gain, Rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub, Night and day, sunshine and rain! Starch and soap and rinse and wring, We'd make heaven a bright clean thing. Happiness is like a bubble. It simply isn't worth our trouble. Rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub, When the sky is gray above, It really is a work of love. We work for one, we work for all! Everybody, great or small! Policeman, soldier, doctor too! Chemist, barber, even you! Student, merchant, family man. Clean them up as best we can. We wash for all: For poor people, their socks. For the rich, their togs, For a clergyman, his cassock. We wash for a baker, A workman and a dressmaker. And even a noble lord Cleanliness won't hurt. Rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub, Night and day, sunshine and rain. Starch and soap and rinse and wring, We'd make heaven a bright clean thing. When the sky is gray above, It really is a work of love. We work for one, we work for all! Everybody, great or small! Soap and water, The best cure. Not one medicine can do more! Cleanliness and hygiene both. Are more than the Hippocratic oath! So all hail to cleanliness, And to those. Whose clothes. Are neatly pressed! Clean and bright, You're an angel of light. With a neat negligee, You're worth what they pay. Dirty clothes mean misery. When they're clean, a man feels free! But when the soul has got a stain, Washing won't take it out again. Good morning, little butterflies! Good morning! Auntie Vardo, have a seat. What's this strange dance? The Quadrille! Maro watched the rich people dance it, and taught me to. Our mother always said she'd like us to be ballerinas. You're real artists, a spot of makeup and you'll be the real thing. Today the dancing class opens. Papa said he'd pay to send us there if they think we're talented. The Professor's an Italian. His name is lnnocenti. So Maro and I learned this dance, just the way they dance it. Come on, watch us! Look what I've got here. Oh, it's lovely! And whose are they? It's none of your business, whose. All you have to do is try not to tear and spoil them. Wear them when you go to your audition. We're all just visiting here, When we're gone, others will appear. We should bring joy to each other, What else is there to do? Oh, I hate so much. Cunning and hypocritical men! I won't accept bread from such, I'd rather die of starvation. When the table is being laid, My soul feels happy. For a glass of wine, I'd give all worldly treasures. I'll make myselfa plough, In it I'll harness a fish, I'll plough and sow in water, And harvest in the sea. What a man! He can do anything! You bet! Papa. Papa! Come here! Hurry! Papa, have you forgotten that today's our dance examination? And who are these young ladies? So lovely and all dressed up. Auntie Vardo says that we look like the Czar’s daughters. So it's her who dressed you up like this? Where‘re you going, Pavle? Don't leave like that. Have another for the road. All the best! My little butterflies are waiting to take me home. Grazie. Quadrille! Bravo! Bravo! Bravissimo! Beautiful! Beautiful! Now do itjust as I tell you. Point, point, point. Good. Your hand, your hand, there! Alissa! Yes, yes, absolutely charming! - And where‘re your parents? - Yes, yes. Papa. Papa! What are you waiting for? Come in! Quick! I think they liked us! Excuse me, who are you? |‘m the father. So these charming talented creatures are yours? Yes, they grew up without their mother. They really love dancing. Yes, they can dance, that's obvious. Only these classes cost money. How much money? Courses in ballet are... Fifty rubles. That's a minimum. Excuse me. My mistake. You misunderstood us. We would do it with great pleasure, but you must understand... We admired your girls, but... What did they say? The higher you go up the ladder, the farther there is to fall. Good evening, Auntie Vardo. Well, my little grasshoppers, did he like the two of you? He praised us. We danced very nicely and your dresses looked great, but anyway... What do you mean? They won't accept us, it's so expensive. Papa could never pay it. He says he can't make that much in all his life. Wait. How much do they want? As much as 50 rubles, and not a kopeck less. Oh, fifty rubles! So if you don't have any money you're not supposed to dance? Right, Auntie Vardo. And you're not supposed to make your bed, too? And not supposed to wash the dishes? And clean up the house? Catch it! This is for you and this for you. Where's your father? We haven't seen him since he brought us home yesterday. I've wandered everywhere in search of happiness, But found nothing but sorrow. There's so much trouble in the world. That the sky would have turned black. The wheel of fortune is turning... Time flows, time flies, Time turns us to dust. Who will understand us? Who will heal our wounds? The wheel of fortune is turning... Where am I to look for the answer? O Lord, open Your eyes! Take a look at my life, And You will burn with shame. Good evening, Papa dear. What's going on? Why aren't you at the landowneﬂs? |‘m not going back to Aha-Georq again. What are you saying? Don't even think of it! Lam not, I'd rather be dead! All that wood |‘m supposed to carry around is just too heavy! What's that? They make you carry wood? Yesterday night some wood was brought to them, and they unloaded it by the fence. When Aha-Georq saw it, he got mad and said: “Even if you have to work all night, you'll put it all in the shed.“ It was too heavy, I only moved half of it. Was I supposed to overstrain myself? So I gave up, and I ran back here. Yes, Vardo, whatever you tried, it didn't get us anywhere. Every hand is against us, even the hand of God. Don't blame the Almighty, Pavle! He looks down even on poor people like us. And why should a man with two daughters like yours complain? One of these days they may get the better of the Czar’s children. Moon in the sky, are you angry with me? You're cold and serene. What do you know of the state |‘m in? You can't understand my sorrow. You'd better throw light on my way. And protect me from the evil eye. Yes, I have to take a sin upon my soul, In order to do a good deed. Your cold light. Cannot dry up human tears. You better hide behind the clouds. And not betray me. Look the other way. And don't ask why |‘m sinning. And if the Lord calls me to account, I won't be making excuses. Maro, wake up! Look at the huge fire burning in the hearth! Oh, how lovely! It's so warm! Look at all the snow outside! So beautiful! And look at all the logs on Papa's cart! Enough to get through all winter! We'll be so nice and warm! Oh, it's so good! Father brought us wood. No one else has such a father! It's so bright, it's so warm! Oh, it's so good! Papa brought us wood! No cold will get to us, Sitting by the hearth is so nice, Listening to the wood crackle. Papa dear! Papa dear! Who will saw? And who will cut? Oak and elm, And pine and nut? Into quarters, and into sticks, into fives and into six. - Who is it? - It's me, laundress Vardo. Ah, Vardo, is that you? - Good morning. - Come on in. What little breeze blew you in? And what's that? Have you caught a bird? - Where did you get that? - At the butcher's. - You mean it? - Absolutely. I came in, there was no one there. That damned Mikhaka was asleep behind the counter, so I took it. You'd better bite your tongue, or the whole street will soon know it. Oh, Vardo, you're just a jack-of-all-trades! I never realized it before! I thought you only had talent for washing. How much do I owe you? I want a fair price, notjust peanuts. Two rubles. It's the 4th one |‘m buying today. - What are you doing? - |‘m taking it back to the butcher. Take your hands off! I may as well add 20 kopecks, and that's it! - Five rubles. - Where are the police looking?! It's the first time in 20 years that I've been asked that much for a calf. Five rubles! Lfl add five more, I can buy a fur coat I've been dreaming about. I have to go to the mountains today, to drive back the cattle I bought. What kind of coat are you keen on? Some good quality. You can get it for 10 or 20 rubles. Ah, Aha-Georq got a nice one! I would've given 50 for one like his. And you wouldn't even bargain?! No. I swear by my departed father! All right, enough about the coat. Let's get back to the calf. All right, I'll give you 3 rubles, and that's a deal. After all, you didn't have to buy it, so you're losing nothing. I told you 5 rubles or it's no deal! Don't touch it! You're insane! Five rubles! Five rubles! You're cutting my throat! Talking of cutting, hand me that knife there. What knife? What do you want a knife for? You're a religious man, aren't you, Pankes? So you know that when you buy stolen goods, you should give to the poor. Well, a piece of liver or spleen. L‘ll look in at the church on the way, and l‘ll leave it there for the poor. I'll say it's Pankes‘s little contribution to charity. You'll do good by sating them, and save your sinful soul. Thanks, beautiful. What a woman! Who'll believe that Pankes. Doesn't mind his interest! That he's not only wheeling and dealing, But to the poor he's also giving! Don't worry, sweetheart, If |‘m untrue. I buy and sell. As rich men do! Tamro, what a smell! That delicious smell! We'll have a wonderful dinner! Super wonderful! What a father! Isn't he sweet! He's brought us a joint of meat. No one else has such a father! Roast it well and serve it hot! It's better than a rich man's got! Let's lay our table neat. And add some spices to the meat. We'll wake our papa up, And like rich men we'll sup! Silence! I can see you there, Dzibo. So come out! My nose is so frozen that it may fall off. What terrible weather! I wanted to warm up in your house, but I thought you were still asleep. You weasel, been spying around again? Wait, why are you in such a hurry? Pavle, the police chief wants to put me on his payroll. It's my duty now to register everything that may be wrong. And what do you want here? Such a nice smell. So I came to find out what's cooking here. Smells like meat. - It's a hare. - With nice long ears? - How did you come by that? - Easy. I opened the lid, and the hare jumped in! Everything is possible. When dreams come true. If yours is a lucky lot, A hare will jump in your pot. Everything is possible. When dreams come true. That hare’s a treat. Salts himself, Peppers himself, Ready to eat. Stop it, Pavle! Are you out of your mind? Proud of the uniform we wear, Serving with ardor and with zeal! We're the guardians of the law, All for the sake of a decent meal. Innocent and guilty too, Arresting them, arresting you! Equal rights are law's decision, Equal rights to go to prison. Report, then. Chief, during the course of last night with reference to our precinct there's nothing to report! Bon appetite! How about the local workers? What's Dzibo saying? Ls any revolution or mutiny on the way? Don't you worry! Peace and quiet on that sector, and thank heaven it is. Wonderful! Take it away! Go on. Someone stole an entire side of veal at the butcher's. - Has it been found? - No, |‘m afraid it's been eaten. Go on. The landlord Georq was robbed of a large quantity of wood. I can understand pinching meat, but a truckload of wood! What are you talking about? An entire truckload! They couldn't carry it away in a sack, could they? That wood is enough to drive anyone crazy! They take it on their backs, on donkeys, anyhow. How can one tell if it's stolen property or their own? Excuse me, Chief, but Mikhaka the butcher would like to see you. Send him in! Good day, Your Honor! I bought a calf for 5 rubles yesterday. I cleaned it and gutted it and hung it up on a hook. And how was it stolen? Lfl knew that I'd know who it was that stole it. And where did someone steal this calf from you? I already told you, in my shop. And where were you? Right there, sir, sleeping behind the counter. - Sleeping! - Sleeping, eh? Was there anybody with you? The delivery boy perhaps? He'd been there, but I sent him out on an errand. And someone stole my calf! Enough about your calf! - I've paid 5 rubles for it! - 5 rubles are immaterial. Stop talking about the calf! But I keep thinking about it all the time. You have only yourself to blame! You were asleep! - But why... - Please go away. The Chief has more important things to decide than your meat. Have you no fear of God? My meat is important, too. |‘d prepared the calf and gutted it and hung it up on a hook. It's clear! You killed the animal! Gutted the animal! Roasted it! Then you probably ate it, and you run over here and accuse someone of theft! |‘m not an idiot, you know? I know the trick you're trying to play on us. Miscreant bloodsucker! A stain on the name of our quarter! Charge him. Why charge? I insist on my rights. What? Are you questioning my authority?! - Try to stay calm, sir. - Throw him out! Into the sweat hole! One or two days down there will fix him! Where are you dragging me? It's not Christian! |‘m an honest man! I bought a calf, I gutted it, and I hung it up on a hook! Shut up! You locked him up? Yes sir! - How much is he giving? - Five rubles. He doesn't have any more on him. He's nearly screaming the place down! - Take the money and let him go. - I already did. Right here! Yes, Chief! One second, Chief. There you are, Chief. Law and order, Made to order. A gold piece here And the case is clear. That |‘m no saint, you can see. I play cards, I like a drinking revelry. |‘m unfaithful to my wife, I take many a bribe. Remember if you've money to spare. Even a policeman needs his share. And one thing I don't want to see, ls trouble in the quarter run by me. That's all I care about! Bravo! You really have the Midas touch, Chief! My respects to you, gentlemen. May I help you? I came here to bother you about a question of stolen wood. I dropped in to see you yesterday, but you were out celebrating somewhere. What's your name? You don’t know my name? I would hardly have believed it! You don't have to believe it. Please, give your name. We have to put it in a report. Put it down. Georq Georqov. Profession? A workman, as you can see. Stop playing the fool! If you know, why do you ask? He's the owner of a house. Many, not one! So your Wood's been stolen. Where was it stolen? In the garden, close to the fence. Might it not have been on the road, outside? In the garden! On my property! I told my girl-servant to bring it in, and she left it outside. I demand a compensation from her parents! Why do the girl's parents have to pay compensation to you? Do you suspect her? I didn't catch her red-handed, but she is to blame for the theft. Someone has to pay me. All right, we will see to it. I'll have them watched carefully. I'll study the situation and find the perpetrator. Latest news! It's not so good. Somebody‘s been stealing wood! If the thief doesn't get away, There‘|| be an execution day! Latest news I have to tell, A calf has been stolen as well! If the thief doesn't get away, There‘|| be an execution day! Someone’s taken a fur coat, so, That's three crimes now in a row! If the thief doesn't get away, There‘|| be an execution day! The thief is clever in this case. Leaving neither clue nor trace! The Police Chief has no way of knowing whether he's coming or he's going. A coat, a calf and half a tree! Where the devil can they be?! The verdict is brief: Lock up the thief! Shoot up the thief! Yes? What is it? I need to see the man who's in charge here. |‘m in charge here. What do you want? It's about two little girls that auditioned for you. And their father... You know, the one on a cart with a whip. - With a whip? - Yes. Oh. Yes, yes, yes! - We remember now. - Yes. And so? The girls danced beautifully, didn't they? Yes, I've rarely seen better. We said as much to their father, only... Yes, yes, I know. I brought the money. Here are the fifty rubles. Take it. Thank you. And who are you... to those children? Oh, nobody. Just a stranger. I beg you not to tell anyone who's paid for them. Madame Incognito! Bravo! Please. - Katamadze! - Yes sir! That's enough! You shameless man! No tricks of yours in my house! Watch out! Come on, children. Yes! Yes! Katamadze, over there! The ladder. Hold this! Now we shall see. As I explained to you already, Chief Constable, the thief could get into my house only through this main entrance. Even a fly can't get into my house! Wait! We'll have your house watched and we will get to the bottom of this. No one doubts that you'll watch and get to the bottom. Only listen to this. Get your men search through Pav|e‘s house. Because his daughter, Maro, had the keys to my mansion. Lfl understand right, my dear, on account of a fur coat and some wood |‘m to stir up the Veriyski Quarter, search all carters, close all shops, send some to prison and some to exile. Try to recall who came to see you yesterday? - To see me? - Yes. Other than the laundress Vardo, no one else was here. Va rd o? Vardo! It can't be Vardo! Everyone knows that Vardo is the soul of honesty and hard work. Even two men at a washboard couldn't wash faster than Vardo. No! No! Such a version is to be discredited. Pardon me! The local citizens want the bloodhound to be sent. Send it! It's found it! Oh, damn it! Pigs. Good morning! - What is it? - My respects. Anything new on the troublemakers? Everything3 fine with them. |‘m watching them, but about what happened yesterday, that cartload of wood and calf. You have reasons to worry. It's none of your business. One second... One second! |‘m doing it with all my heart. You're my benefactor. |‘m already trying on new epaulettes. If only you see it fit to promote me... I'll do my best to do you a favor. We know your kind. So what have you got to tell us? May I sit down? From what |‘m given to understand, this log here is one of the cartload stolen from Georqov. Yes, that's the one. Where‘d you find it? Where? The Lord is my witness! If someone told me that, or if I hadn’t watched it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it. Well, we all are conceived in sin. If the devil wants it, he can lead even a saint into evil ways. You mean to say you picked that log at the church door? You're right, sir. I swear your Grace I found it at the door. Whose door? You know Pavle, the carter? Have you found the fur coat too? Fur coat? No fur coat. But he's got the wood. And there's a very pleasant odor around there, like cooked veal! My dear. We came to inform you that your charming girls have been accepted to ballet classes. Yes, yes, yes. Thank you, thank you. But I got no money. Please do not worry about money. You see... well... there‘re people in this town... who care for your children. What's this? Tie them all up! What are you taking us for? Leave me alone! It hurts! Give me my hat! Give me my hat! I'll show you! What are you doing, you fool? Let our father go! May I report, sir? The operation has been successfully concluded! The carter Pavle and his band have been safely isolated. I'll be complaining... - Search him! - Yes sir! You have no right! What are you doing, gentlemen? You can't! Oh, my God! Turn around! You sack of hay! What do you need the kerchiefs for? Why? What are you doing? - Eureka! - That's my money. - Fifty rubles. - Put it away. - Wait! - Yes sir. This lady... I had better search her personally. All right, you scallywag! Tell us how you stole that meat and wood etcetera. I've never stolen anything in my life. He's lying, that's obvious. |‘m not lying, |‘m saying the truth. The other day I woke up and I saw it'd been snowing. The fire was burning in the hearth, and a pile of wood on my cart outside. And that's not all - I woke up yesterday, there's another fire under the pot and big pieces of liver and spleen cooking. And today he awakens in a fur coat, I suppose? No, nothing like that, I won't say that. You won't say? Down below! A day or two in there, and you'll be in the mood to talk! Arrest him! Why, Your Honor? What did I do?! Where did you get these 50 rubles? They were presented to us by an incognito woman who refused to give us her name. She gave it to us so that we would teach European dances to the daughters of the man that you have just locked up. The fee for our ballet classes is exactly the sum of 50 rubles. What a terrific story! I shall arrest you, too. And tomorrow you will tell me just how that blackguard sold the coat and gave you the 50 rubles. Arrest him! What? You have no right, gentlemen! |‘m a foreigner, do you understand? A foreigner! And she's my wife! My wife! I already said it. I will attend to your wife personally. How dare you?! Oh, my darling wife! Don't give in, Alissa! Please. Auntie Vardo! Auntie Vardo! - What's the matter? - Papa's been arrested! They took Papa to the police station! No, it can't be. I hope you're satisfied now? |‘m more than satisfied, |‘m greatly impressed! The Lord has endowed you with the gift of foresight. L‘ll never forgive myself for doubting your ability. I'll proclaim from every rooftop that you're a genius of investigation! - Where do you think you're going? - Let me through! Vardo! Ls anything the matter? I don't really know how to reply. You all look so important here. Why would you want to listen to me? On the contrary, to me every your word is worth its weight in gold. Believe me, poor old Pavle never stole anything! You have arrested the wrong man. That's only your innocent mind. If you never steal, you think others are the same. Only you're wrong, Vardo. Except you, all are thieves here. Lam the thief! You don't believe me? I stole a calf from Mikhaka, a coat and wood from Aha-Georq, with my own hands. These are just words. You have no proof. Proof? As you wish. Call Policeman Shanshe here. Ask him when the wood was stolen and whom he saw on the cart that night. Call Mikhaka in here and ask him who came into his shop, Vardo or Pavle? And find out who came to the ballet master and gave him 50 rubles to pay for classes for the girls. Excuse me, Chief, allow me to bring that police... ballet master. Are you out of your mind? If this should be corroborated, I'll have to send you down there. I don't care. All the misery‘s for the ordinary people. And all the pleasures are for fine gentlemen like this one here. They get everything: Dry wood, warm fur coats, and even dancing classes. - Easy! - Take your hands off! Hello! You recognize me? I was wearing a hat, remember? Madame Incognito! I did tell you that it was an unknown lady who brought the money! Did you hear? That's how it was! Arrest me, and release an innocent man whose children are waiting for him. Arrest me. Someone else will help them through life. Do I arrest her, Chief? No other way. She asked for it. Who'd you sell my fur coat to? I'll leave you to find that out by yourself. Look who buys stolen things in this quarter and you'll find your coat. Come out of there! Move it! You may go. What are you doing here, Vardo? Let's not talk about it, Pavle... As the saying goes, “heaven helps those who help themselves“. The fur coat, the meat, and the wood? It was you? I thought I'd help your children. But as they say, thieves never prosper. When you build happiness on a lie, The sand won't hold the water. You have to pay the price. And your dreams die. When you see a young tree die, You can't but help it. When light borders on dark, Good never wins. Don't build your happiness on a lie. See how talented she is? Take care of her. Such a woman loves you! You scarecrow! What fur coat? There‘re only old rags here. What's that? - A bird, Gulnara. - What? - Katamadze! - Yes sir! And how about this pack here? Who gave this money to Vardo? How should I know? I've never seen so much even in a dream. You haven't? Then you won't see it in reality. My dear Chief! A very dear Chief! Now listen. You've got three days to think. After that you'll either return his fur coat or you'll get put down below and you'll pay the coat 5 times over. Why should I be deprived of my coat for 3 more days? What?! I've turned the whole quarter back to front on account of you! To oblige you, I've imprisoned an honest woman - Vardo. And you still have the gall to be complaining? That's enough! I wash my hands off this terrible business! Water! Bloodsucker! Morning, noon and evening too, We've done the dirty clothes for you. We've had just about all we can take, So do your own. Till your backs break! Vardo‘s our friend, a girl of worth, There's not a better one on the earth! Why should she suffer, when all she did. Was think of the happiness of his kids? Goodbye, starch! Goodbye, the tub! Goodbye, Soap! No more rub-a-dub-dub! The laundry’s closed! Mister Police Chief. Thank you. Mister Police Chief, you put and end to stealing. But a new misfortune has fallen upon us now. The whole quarter wears dirty clothes. Shocking! I got so lice-ridden that I can think of only one solution. I suggest that, if it's not too late already, you free Vardo. Even a cinder can burn a house. Today all the washen/vomen refuse to work. And tomorrow they may go out on the street. - Revolt? - It looks like it. Revolt! - It's very probable. - Revolt! Just look what's going on in the world! - Germany. - Germany? - Paris. - Oh my god! Warsaw. The Siberian gold mines. First they go on strike, then they go into the streets and set up barricades! A nightmare! And moreover... If you remember, tomorrow is Christmas. Imagine the situation that our upper classes are going to be in. They'll have to celebrate Christmas in an utterly unholy condition. What will our clergy think? Oh God, what our clergy is going to think! Katamadze! Ready, sir! Just like new! TO hell with all that! Release the laundress Vardo now! The laundress Vardo? This is an order! Go and open Vardo‘s cell! - Yes sir! - Fonlvard! Halt! Come back! Oh, those little girls, I forgot! What little girls? Pav|e‘s daughters. Yes, so what? Take them to the dancing school, or we won't stand a chance! But where do I get the money? They want 50 rubles. Farewell, our rubles. All right, go and do it. Tell that ballet master that the girls are recommended by the police. He'll admit them to dancing classes, or I'll have him drummed out of the Veriyski Quarter! It has been a pleasure. Bravo! Papa! Papa! Look who is here! I wish happiness to your home. May it come here by your prayer. A Merry Christmas! On December 25, Jesus was born. The stars had shone on Eden. The shepherds glorified God, and fed the pigeons. The Magi were feasting, rejoicing at the Mother. On December 25, Jesus was born. I put my hand in the basket, But found nothing in there. If I am not lucky, May the Lord send you. The sun of truth, the column of light. He'll smile upon our sadness, Our hearts are full of gladness. We'll always sing together A merry Christmas song. And may a little shepherd Wake up us at dawn. - Alissa. - Merci. We've come to bring you a Christmas present. We will admit your girls to our dance classes. Yes. Thank you, but... And the money? Money isn't everything. You see, this town is full of people who dream of making your girls happy. - Yes. - Yes. Here. Honored guests, ladies and gentlemen! |‘m happy to say». To all Tiflis people today, That our class in ballet ls now under way. Our class in ballet. It's open to all, To short and to tall, To all who can fall. To the spell of Art's call. Honor and fame both you await. Dancing is life, so don't hesitate. A life of joy ls a life of art. A life-long love. That will never part. Don't be sad, You'll be so proud. When the crowd are cheering loud. To the dazzling heights. They'll dance away. But it's for their daddy. They dance today. Art is life, And dancing‘s joy! So dance now, Every girl and boy! The End
