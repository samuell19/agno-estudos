[ Man On Phone ] Look, it's easy money, even for someone of your talents. Don't mess this up. Stay away from the sauce and the women. ** [ Radio: Rock ] Hey, are you listening to me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, did you borrow your little sister's car? You've gotta be kidding me. - You want to go? - You want to go-- [ Engine Revs ] Let's go. - You ready? You sure? - [ Engine Revs ] All righty. [ Engine Knocking ] Come on, baby. Come on, baby. [ Engine Cranking ] Come on, baby. [ Engine Starts ] Hoo! I'll never do that to you again, I promise. [ Birds Twittering ] [ Hand Brake Ratchets ] Done with that. [ Sighs ] Lance Williams. Ex-football player. Family of four. Slipped disc in lower back. Ouch. Who are you? Who sent you? You're assuming. - Get up outta the ride, man. - What are you doing? Get out of here. Get out of my house! - Hey, get off of me. - What are you doing here? Very nice, mister. [ Panting ] Hey, get back here. [ Muttering ] Get-- [ Tires Squealing ] [ Chattering ] Did I tell you how my brother was shot in the ass by my grandma... for calling her white trash? [ Snickering ] Yes, Jason, you told me that story yesterday and last week, and last month. Well, can I have a shot of sex on the beach? No, you've had enough for the day. [ Whispering ] How about a blow job? Go home and sleep it off. I don't like to sleep alone. What can I get you? Hello, Heather. I won't dare ask you for a blow job-- [ Scoffs ] but I could use a whiskey on the rocks, please. You're not from around here, are you? How you figure? 'Cause I haven't seen you before. I'm from the north. Oh, cow country? No, Pellston. Never heard of it. Must rock. Must be the cultured, cultivated type. Yes, I am. I can play the piano, and I'm a hell of a dancer. Right. And why are you looking at me like that? I'm reading your eyes. The eyes tell you everything about a person. Where I come from, when a woman looks at a man like that, she's interested. This ain't Pellston. Sorry. Uncultured. Uncultivated. You're here on business, and you hate your job. That's it? You could say that to anybody. Who doesn't hate their job? The eyes don't lie. Well, your eyes tell me something. [ Scoffs ] Like? You want my number. Why are you here anyway? What time do you get off? I don't go out with guys I meet in bars. I don't go out with guys I meet in bars either. Men are pigs. Tell me about it. Well, I, Bryan, find your eye readings fascinating, and-- You want me to fascinate you? Wow. You read minds too. Look, Bryan, you're not my type. You don't know what you're missing. Yes, I do. You can see the future? [ Bell Dings ] ** [ Stereo: Rock ] [ Chattering ] ** [ Piano: Nocturne No. 2 By Chopin ] ** [ Continues ] ** [ Ends ] I'm a music student at the University of Michigan. You just played Nocturne-- Number two, in E-flat, by Chopin. Uncultured? Uncultivated? You gonna behave? No. [ Chuckles ] [ Bell Dings ] [ Exhales ] Thought I wasn't your type. Yeah. It's your dancing-- the way you move your shoulders. Shoulders? Yeah. No, don't. Don't-Don't-- Don't move. I have to. [ Moaning ] [ Sighs ] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I can't believe I'm doing this. A little spontaneity is good for you. What would my mother think? Better her than your father. [ Sighs ] I don't know my father. I guess that means he won't come after me. You're beautiful. Don't ruin you. My mother left my father for another man. She moved us away... and I lost contact with him. Sorry. But-- What? You don't have psychological issues, do you? I'm just asking. [ Laughs ] Are you an investigator? [ Bryan ] I guess you could say that. I'm working an insurance fraud case. Yeah? Exciting stuff. You want to work on me a little more? Yes ma'am. [ Giggles ] [ Gate Squeaking ] [ Sniffs ] I think that I have the winning hand. I doubt that. Can you beat four of a kind? Oh, my-- You're cheating. Oh, please. All right, take a breath. Go on. You and your demands. [ Inhales, Exhales ] All right, I was cheating. [ Laughing ] Why do you do that? Warrior scar? Client hired me. His wife was cheating. You slept with her? Are you gonna break my heart? I don't do that anymore. I thought I was the one with psychological issues. You still are. [ Dog Barking ] [ Gate Squeaks ] Ms. Thompson? I mean, ma'am. I was wondering if you could help me change a flat tire. Are you good with your hands? [ Gunshot ] Oh, shit. [ Gunshot ] [ Panting ] Why does everybody hate me? Your favorite, screwdriver. [ Sighs ] Are you okay? What happened? You know how it is at work... when you work really hard... and someone gives you the finger? Well, today I got a big finger. Yeah. And loud too. Ohh. Let Heather fix it, baby. I'll make it good. I'll be off soon. Same place? I got a surprise for you. Look, just pay me for services rendered. I don't understand. I'm tired of people trying to kill me. What? Look at the footage. Bryan, relax. This is what we pay you to do. To get shot at? A drink won't make me stay. [ Chuckles ] Drink up, my friend. What the hell are you doing? Who are you? [ Bryan ] Ho, ho, ho. Who sent you, man, huh? Oh, shit. [ Gunshot ] Oh, shit. [ Gunshot ] [ Bryan ] Nice, huh? Yeah. This'll do. You gonna write me a check? Oh, we're gonna do better than that. You and me, we're going for a ride. [ Chuckles ] Look, don't get me wrong. I love trips, but... not tonight. Oh, no, you didn't. [ Wind Whistling ] - [ Laughing ] - [ Chains Clinking ] [ Man ] Glad you could join us. [ Chuckles ] Seems you've had too much to drink. Look, whoever you are. I know I can hold my liquor. I must say it took some time to find somebody nobody gave a shit about. That's not true. My dog Poochie does. [ Chuckles ] We're gonna throw you off this bridge. You got the wrong guy. No. [ Chuckles ] We got the right guy. You're making a big mistake. I know people. No, you don't. [ Horn Blows ] Hey. Want to go? [ Engine Revs ] All right. Nice, huh? Asshole. [ Woman ] It's summertime. This is the only condo available, so there isn't much to pick from. Does it come with the furniture? Yeah, sure, if you want it. Nice view, huh? [ Man ] Do you take cash? It's 10,000 a month. I said, do you take cash? You betcha. [ Panting ] Hey, there you are. You tricked me. You're welcome. Wait, let me help you with this. No, no, no, no. Why? Because you seem like an ass, and I don't like asses. I like female asses. I noticed. Are you always this angry? Yeah, but today's your lucky day. I'm feeling just great. Oh, cool. So then I should be thankful. Yeah. All right. Do you mind if I-- No. No. [ Sighs ] Just don't drop it. All right. Whoa! [ Laughing ] Just kidding. Wow. This is an awesome crib, especially for somebody with such a crappy car. As if it's any of your business, it was the last rental car available. Okay, I'll put this right here. No, no. Right there is fine. Kidding, kidding. Uh, Tom Lipnity. I know, it's a hilarious name. Just call me Tom. I'm your neighbor. I'm right behind, not that wall, but that wall. If you knock like this, I'll probably hear it 'cause we're that close. And, uh, you are? Alex Forrester. Alex Forrester. Well, I'm very glad that you live here, because the last tenants were jerks, quite frankly. They were always complaining about the lack of privacy... and the other neighbors. Imagine that. I'm just here for the summer, till I finish my book. I hear books are on their way out. You know where the money is? Reality shows. Watching the lives of gold-digging bitches... and enraged alcoholics stimulates you? Oh, yeah. Of course. It's awesome. You seem like a man of intellect, a man of depth. Thank you, Alex. Most people don't get that for some reason. ** [ Cell Phone: Jingle ] It's nice though. Excuse me. Important business. But, uh, you know, Alex, where I come from friendship trumps business, so I'm gonna ignore this and return later, and stay here and help you. So I'll just-- I will, uh-- I will take care of that, thank you. All right, why don't you just go over there and just start writing away, and I'll put the rest of this stuff where I think it should go. No, no, no. I'm good. No, don't worry. I got nothing to do, Seriously, nothing at all. I'd be happy to help you. That's a shocker, but I can handle it. I'm sure you have something. No, I don't have anything, I swear. How about a shower? Shower. Oh, I did that yesterday. I have some story ideas, but they all involved gold-digging bitches. I know you don't like that right now. I'm sure you do. If you hit a, you know, wall with that, you know, call me, 'cause I'm your neighbor, right behind, uh-- You know, we're like this, and we're gonna be like this all summer so-- Anyway, I'm just glad to have you in the hood and, uh, wanted to welcome you. This is how we do it. That's how we roll. Not too gay, is it? Would have been gay if I'd have done that, but I wouldn't do that to you. Anyway, thank you. I'm a knock away. Welcome. Um, thank you. Mm-hmm. And, uh, any help you need buddy, you know, with-- [ Glass Shatters ] with that, uh, I'll be right next door. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. Oh, my God. [ Woman ] Can I help you? [ Alex ] Yeah. Can you direct me to a Lawson's Law Office? The address I have is 15 Main Avenue, number 2. That's the upstairs address. The old owner used to rent it. How long ago was that? About six months ago. Do you happen to know the old owner's name? A doctor-- Michael Pinklady. Pinklady. Mm-hmm. Okay, thank you. Doctor Pinklady? Yeah? I understand you used to practice medicine at 15 Main Avenue? That's correct. Can you tell me where they moved the Lawson's Law Office? Never heard of it. Used to be on the floor above you. I really don't know what you're talking about. Who are you? I must be mistaken. Thank you. [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Typing ] [ Sighs ] ** [ Jukebox: Pop ] [ Chattering, Laughing ] Hey, beautiful. Did I ever tell you... how my brother got shot in the ass by my grandma... for calling her white trash? [ Laughs ] [ Chuckles ] Yes, Jason, many times. Oh. All right, no more drinks for you tonight. Well, I quit. Oh. Am I talking to Jason, or am I talking to someone else? Jason, yeah. No more sex on the beach. No more blow jobs. Good for you, Jason. Good for you. Uh, can I have an orgasm? Good night, Jason. Good night, princess. Watch out for this one. [ Chuckles ] That was entertaining. What can I get you? How about a pomegranate juice, please. Not one I hear every day. Look, maybe you can help me. I'm looking for Lawson's Law Office. Used to be right across the street from here. Ever heard of it? Why, you need a lawyer? No, I'm doing research for a book. What kind of book? True crime story about Bryan Spikes. You ever heard of him? Yeah, made the headlines after what he did. He came in here a few times. This guy right here-- He came in here? Yeah. What can you tell me about him? He didn't say much. [ Tom ] Looking for skinny dippers? Hey-- Take a gander at that baby. Technology, man. Blow your mind. [ Whirs ] Huh? I know my scopes. I was a sharpshooter in the marines. You were in the marines? Yeah. But I took early retirement when my wife passed. Couldn't do anything after that. Still managed to put on a few pounds, which is why I'm on a special six-meal diet plan right now. Keeps the metabolism up. All the pro wrestlers swear by it. In fact, I'm due for my late-night snack. So, you know, if you'd like to join me-- I don't want to be annoying. You are annoying, but I am hungry, so sure. I'm gonna put on some cologne, and I'll be right back. Keep looking. It's fun. All right, thank you. - ** [ Jukebox: Pop ] - [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Chattering ] Yeah, I lost my wife to cancer. You'd have really liked her. I'm sorry, Tom. Yep, 30 years together, then poof. She was an acupuncturist. She used to prick me all the time. You know, one time she looked at me passionately, and she leaned in, said, "Honey, I need to tell you something. You have a huge booger right there. It's making me sick." That's my Ashley. [ Chuckles ] How long were you in the marines? Mmm. Who knows? I bet you have some stories though. Yeah, that's what I'm saying, man. We should partner up. We? Yeah! Iraq, Afghanistan, you name it. I still got sand in my ass from those places. You should write about it. I don't know the difference between a verb and a noun, man, and I'm a sucky speller. I haven't written anything yet, and I suck at spelling too. Well, then, we're a doomed partnership. To sucky spellers. [ Chuckling ] Oh, you know, I was showing my girlfriend... how to put a condom on using her mouth. So there I was-- [ Laughs ] with a banana... and a condom in my mouth, and her mom walks in. You know this guy? No. Get the fuck out of here. Oh. That was cool. This is my first book. [ Sighs ] Job was getting kind of stressful. Midlife crisis I guess. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I had one of those too. It sucks. Especially the soft erections. I haven't reached that stage yet. Oh, but you will, and then all your dreams of being a sexual dynamo... will go right down the tubes. I will keep that in mind. Mm-hmm. You should. What'd you say you used to do for a living? I was an investigator. I guess that's why I decided to write about Bryan Spikes. Well, he is a hell of a story. I worked with him once. He was a drunk womanizer. Couldn't keep a job. But I guess I'm curious to what made him flip, you know? Yeah. Here you go. Uh-huh. Hmm! Thank you. And juice for you, on the house. Hmm. And, say, what time is it, by the way? 8:35. Right. Hey. She does not like me. You got a phone number? Are you kidding me? I wish I could get girls like that. I'd have to lose a lot of weight, start dressing better, work my deltoids. Maybe you should just be yourself. It'd be a hell of a lot easier. You're really great, Alex, you know that? Sure. Awesome, man. [ Children Chattering, Laughing ] Are you the writer? Everybody works for them. What do you mean? You just don't know who's in on it. In on what? I'm not following you. Spikes was set up. How do you know that? Mary Thompson was my sister. She worked at the Youngstown plant. She was on the cleaning staff. Freighters come in nightly off the lakes, supposedly carrying wood. One night, she and a coworker, Lance Williams, stumbled on some men clearing a ship. They weren't carrying wood. Drugs? She called me. I told her to tell the police. Who did she talk to? An Officer Davis. He told her not to say anything because it was under investigation. A week later she was laid off. Police report said she suffered from arthritis. Bullshit. [ Quietly ] She was as strong as an ox. So was Lance for Christ's sake. He was an athlete. How do you know Spikes wasn't involved? [ Exhales ] Mary started getting death threats, so I was staying with her. That's where I saw Spikes snooping around her house. I fired a gun to scare him off. It worked. Spikes wasn't capable of murder, because he never came back. She was 60 years old, my sister. [ Sniffles ] I shouldn't have told you anything. What do you mean? So what made you write a book... about a worthless loser like Spikes? Let's just say that I find psychotic episodes very interesting. Psychotic episodes? Yeah, when somebody totally sane turns murderously violent. Well, let's see. He slept with women that he was hired to watch. Oh, he was an alcoholic. And he stole thousands from his clients. Yeah, but he wasn't a murderer. See, I've been in this department 28 years. People like that, they don't walk around with "killer" written on their forehead. How do you know? Have a seat. Smith, give me that bag. This video was found in Spikes's abandoned car. It was filled with his fingerprints and his victims' DNA. I have to warn you, it's pretty gruesome. [ Williams ] What are you doing? Who are you? [ Bryan ] Ho. Ho. Who sent you? This is Lance Williams. He and his family were killed. As you can see, he's a real angel. That's Ronald Greenberg and his wife. He broke into their house and slashed their throats. This is Mary Thompson. That piece of garbage sexually assaulted her with her gardening tools. Now, this next part's too disgusting to watch. That's some pretty hard evidence to deny, isn't it? Bryan Spikes was a cold-blooded killer. Why don't you put that in your book? Can I see the police reports on this? Yeah. You can get them on the way out. I'd also like to talk to a, uh, Detective Davis. Well, unfortunately, he's in Chicago. Some seminar on drug enforcement. Can you please have him give me a call? Yeah. Glad to be of help. Oh, one more thing. Do you happen to know where a Lawson's Law Office is? No. You need a lawyer? No. Thank you. Row. Stop. [ Thompson ] I beg you. [ Voice Cracking ] I have a granddaughter. [ Silenced Gunshot ] [ Gasping, Gurgling ] [ Brakes Squeak ] Hi. My name is Alex Forrester. I'm a writer. I'd like to ask you some questions about your neighbors. I don't like to talk to strangers. This will only take a few seconds. Oh-- Okay. [ Man On TV ] ...over to Johnstone. Slam dunk! Unbelievable as New England strikes first. Coach Thompson cannot be happy with that quick-shot selection by Denver. That was kind of rude. ...over to Williams. Do you live alone? Sort of. ...the Denver fans get into it. [ Continues, Indistinct ] [ Stammers ] [ Alex ] Are you a surveyor? I don't even know what that is. The police report says that you found the Greenbergs. If I say yes, would it be okay? When did you last see them? That morning. They took the boat out skiing. Did you see them come back? No. And did you see Bryan Spikes there? The day before, snooping around with a camera. You're not gonna-- You're not gonna tell anyone, are you? No. I'll use you as a confidential source. Thank you though. One more question. What did Mr. Greenberg do for a living? He was a lawyer. Worked out of his house. Lance Williams was his client. [ Radio Continues, Indistinct ] Thank you. [ Sighs ] Mr. Youngstown? Not so close. No, it's all right. I got it. I'm a writer. I know who you are, Mr. Forrester. I'm in a hurry. I'd like to ask you some questions... about the employees you lost in that murder spree. No comment. Go. Nothing at all? [ Heather On Phone ] This is Heather. Hey, Heather, it's Alex. I need you to set up a meeting with that guy I met the other day. Hi. Hi. Listen, I-- I can't get ahold of him. He hasn't been into the bar, and his phone just goes to voice mail. What are you not telling me? [ Exhales ] You know, why should I trust you? Have I given you a reason not to? [ Sighs ] I knew Bryan... a lot more than I let on. We had a-- I liked him. A lot. He said that he was following people... involved in insurance fraud. And I saw him the night of the murders. He looked worried. I just can't believe that he killed those people. All the evidence points at him, Heather. He gave me this. [ Laughing ] He found my father for me. Would a crazy killer do something like that? Why did this happen? [ Sniffles ] I'm trying to figure that out. [ Exhales ] [ Crying ] [ Alex Thinking ] The profits soar. Profits go up. The company has record profits. His son John takes over. Son takes over. Profits soar. Profits go up. His son takes over. And the company has record profits. George Youngstown retires. Father retires, his son John takes over... and the company has record profits. [ Ship Horn Blows ] When you grow up, you're gonna have one just like her. Looks like that girl in Accounting. [ Laughing ] [ Clears Throat ] [ Clearing Throat ] We need to get back into the business markets. Ah, we tried that a couple years ago and almost sank the company. The timing was wrong. If you learned nothing from me over the years, you should know... it's all about feeding the right markets. - Sir, if you'll allow me-- - Who the fuck are you? Listen to me, you little snot. You spoiled little brat. You think this is all about you. This is my company. I built it. My hands. Thirty-five years. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit back and watch you run it up on the rocks. Pop, have you seen the numbers lately? We're fine. - Hmm. - Clearly, there's something bothering you. Why don't you go ahead and get that off your chest. I'll tell you what's bothering me. There's a grave being dug, a big grave-- big enough for every single one of you butt-heads. Because there is a man who's writing about the dead employees. Now that sounds bad for business, doesn't it? In fact, that is the kind of publicity that could bury us! So I can't wait to hear how you dickheads are planning to dig us out of this shit pile! Pop, listen to me. Let me handle this, okay? The heat's gonna die down, everything will get back to normal. Normal, you think? You listen to me. The economies of scale may have given us some trouble in the past-- I will be damned if I'm gonna let that happen again! [ Sighs ] [ Engine Grinds, Backfires ] You all right? [ Explodes ] Looks like somebody wants you dead, man. [ Shutter Clicking ] [ Airplane Takes Off ] [ Shutter Clicking ] Here we go. So how do you like your wiener? Not too brown, and not from the ground, please. I like mine burnt, with or without dirt. - You really should try and be more healthy. - I know. I got me one of them yoga tapes, but I can only make it halfway through. Those women are so sexy. You can borrow it sometime if you want to. No, thanks. Whoa! Whoa! Are you all right? Yeah. It's all part of the thing. How's the writing going? Lots of spelling errors. You know what? I heard about this new thing called spell-check. You should try it. I'll look into that. Hey, what do you remember about the Spikes murders? Not much. Just what was in the papers. I mean, that's all everybody talked about for a long time. Until they found the body. Body? Yeah. Spikes's body. That is weird. I mean, uh, his murders made headlines, but his body didn't. It's-- It's crazy. That is interesting. See, that weekend, my girlfriend and I were out. It didn't go very well. The wife didn't like it. Right. So you didn't do the autopsy? No. The police were in a hurry. They had a local doctor do it. This is the file. Can I see the file on Mary Thompson? I digs me a lot of graves, all day long. I-I can't be sure where every single one is. I'll try and find it for you. Gotta be around here. Right here. I'd like to see the body. I don't think I can do that. Sure you can. All right. Why not? It's not normal, for one. And for two, the thought of it, and the smell, creeps me out. I understand. Will this help? I'll get the shovel. [ Shovel Thuds ] I got somethin'. I ain't touchin' that. Be careful. The stench will knock you over. It doesn't smell so bad, now, does it? I really can't talk to you. How can you sign an autopsy report when there's no body for Bryan Spikes? I want a name. Give me a name. I, uh, really don't do house calls anymore. Try this, until you can see a practicing doctor. I hope this helps. It will. Thank you. Tom? [ Exhales ] [ Voice Breaking ] Hey-- Hey, I'm sorry. You know, my wife, Ashley-- After we made love, she'd hum this little tune-- This-- It's the sweetest thing I ever heard, and... she would just keep on humming until she drifted off to sleep. And then in the middle of the night, she'd... press her little body against mine and just hold on to me. It was... the best thing to ever happen to me, Alex. You know, I-- I just ask myself every day-- I mean, who's gonna love me like that? Who's gonna take care of me the way that she did? I understand, Tom. Yeah. Alex, you don't have a box of Kleenex on you, do you? No, not on me. Okay. [ Sighs ] Maybe when I get back, we can go get a drink. Talk about being sexual dynamos. That'd be real nice, Alex. [ Sniffles ] Thank you. Shit. Call the police! - [ Horn Honks ] - Move. [ Grunts ] Hey, watch it! Hey, watch it, dude! Hey, what the hell? - [ Grunts ] - [ Shrieks ] Hey, hey! Get outta my boat. [ Grunts ] [ Grunting ] Get down! Get down! - [ Grunts ] - Get down! - [ Gunshot ] - [ Woman Screams ] [ Grunting ] Get out of the way! [ Grunting ] [ Silenced Gunshot ] [ Groans ] Freeze! Drop the gun. On your knees. You've been asking too many questions. [ Two Silenced Gunshots ] You know, a simple thanks would be nice. Thanks. Yeah. Well, that was simple. I thought you couldn't hit anything. Well-- [ Sighs ] I don't know what happened. I-I panicked. I'm sorry. You didn't call the police? No, I couldn't find my cell phone. But we gotta go down there right now and explain the whole story. No. I know a guy in the F.B.I. He'll help us out. Not yet. The police have no clue you did this. The bullet's a clue. I think those two dead bodies might be a pretty good clue too. - We'll tell them later. - [ Sighs ] Okay. All right. We'll tell them later. But for right now, since our relationship has suddenly got so real, tell me exactly what the hell is going on here! Sure. I was supposed to meet a Dr. Pinklady. Pinklady. Yeah, Pinklady. That-- I miss the days when I was the weird neighbor and you were the smart one. He said people were following him. What people, Alex? Had I known that, Tom, I wouldn't have gone out there, now, would I? Gimme your gun. Why? If the police come looking for it, tell them I stole it from you. Explain that to me. If they trace the gun, I want them to trace it to me, not to you. Okay. Give me the gun. [ Mutters ] I can't do that. When we shared that nongay man-hug in the hall the first day we met, that was my vow of friendship-- an unconditional bond that I will always, no matter what, have your back, which, now that I say it, sounds gayer than the hug. But I think you know what I mean. If you don't give me that gun, I'm gonna tell Heather about your soft erections. Oh, my God! You're going to soft erections? I never thought you'd go there, man. There's no such thing. It's an oxymoron, like "military intelligence." - Those are your words, Tom. - They don't make sense! Remember? I'm crazy! I'm the weird one! But I'll make you this deal. On the one-in-a-million chance that you still are the smart one, I'll give you my "rifle," they're called, by the way. Here. But I want you to know something. If you screw this up and we both end up in prison, we are through. We are broke up. There's no more Alex and Tom! - All right? It's over by then. - Fine! Okay. Now give me a goddamn drink! I don't have alcohol. Then give me my gun back. I'm going down to the liquor store. [ Police Radio Chatter ] [ Siren Approaching ] [ Siren Stops ] [ Heather ] Should I be worried about my life too? [ Alex ] Not as long as I'm alive. Everybody you've met ends up dead. [ Sighs ] Yeah, it's not very promising, is it? I've gotta clean up. [ Siren Chirping In Distance ] [ Sighs ] ** [ Plucks Note ] ** [ Soft ] You into music? Not so much anymore. ** [ Continues ] ** [ Off ] You have a woman back home? I used to. But I left her. To save her from pain and suffering? The sun would rise and set with her, but... there were things I needed to do. There's a dark side to you, isn't there? [ Cell Phone Rings ] [ Man ] Alex Forrester? Yeah. Detective Davis here. Investigator for the Spikes case. I've been waiting for your call. We can work together to blow this case open. Sunflower Road, 232. Got it. Spikes was innocent. Who was that? I have to go. Are you gonna be okay? [ Sighs ] Not sure. [ Sighs ] I'm at the club till close. I'll meet when you get off. [ Scoffs ] To protect me? Don't leave without me. [ Vehicle Approaching ] [ Tires Screeching ] [ Shrieking ] [ Shrieking Continues ] Hello. [ Grunts ] [ Gasping ] Oh, my God! [ Screaming ] - Hey, that's my girl! - Jason, help me! [ Screaming ] Help me! [ Heather ] Jason! Come in. Money must be good in police work. Hmm. Real estate-- It's a hobby of mine. Scotch? I don't drink. That's what they all say. [ Sighs ] It's from Ireland-- real rare stuff. Have a seat. [ Groans ] I know who killed him. I want names. Look. Before I tell you anything, are you working with anyone else? No. You don't know who to trust. You might talk to somebody who works for them, which would lead to me, and that would blow this whole operation. Is this under investigation? Always. At least until we find the leaks. There's no record of an Alex Forrester with the D.M.V. [ Clicks ] Care to explain? Why did you kill Bryan Spikes? It was never about Spikes. We just needed a loser to pin the murders on. There is something I know that you don't. [ Gunshot ] [ Gun Clatters ] A smart detective would have checked me for a gun. [ Groaning ] They'll find you. Who gave the order to kill Spikes? [ Grunts, Coughs ] [ Groaning, Gasping ] Who-- Who are you? I'm a writer. I'm writing a book. [ Grunting ] ** [ Cell Phone: Jingle ] ** [ Stops ] Yeah. [ Man ] We got the girl. She alive? Not for long. The boss wants you to bring the writer's body in. [ Beeps ] [ Grunts ] - [ Gun Cocks ] - Hey, buddy. - Hey, I'm glad you're here. - You looking for that? Yeah. Where'd you find it? - On the guy who just tried to kill me. - What? Someone broke into my apartment a couple days ago, and I think-- - That's convenient. - I swear! - You set me up. - I would never do that to you, Alex. Use it. What? No! Use it! No! Alex, you're my only friend! We're family! I don't know who to trust anymore. You can trust me. Heather's in trouble. What? - I thought I could count on you. - You can. This is what they were looking for. If you're one of them, I guess we're gonna find out. You'll know where to find me. You'll know where to find me. Jesus Christ. Good morning, George. What the hell are you doing in my house? Where's your son? What's taking him so long? I'm not the loquacious type, so I hope you don't find me disconcerting when I say you're about to die. [ Gasps ] Water, please. Women are more fun to kill, aren't they? You can do more with them. [ Singsongy ] I'm gonna be spreading those nice legs of yours. I have been waiting a long time to touch you. [ Glass Shatters In Distance ] What the hell was that? Call Davis now. [ Beeps ] [ Cell Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] Answer it! Hello? That's Davis's phone. Looks like the idiot neighbor's not so dumb after all. Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh. [ Grunts ] [ Grunting ] Untie her. The mania of vendetta. Mr. Forrester, I presume. [ Groans ] You're one rude but dedicated writer. Let's just say that the subject matter's kind of personal to me. You set up Bryan Spikes to cover your murders. You're nothing but a two-bit drug pimp. [ Chuckles ] Come on. You wouldn't want my life? All the power and money? Spare me. What good is all this from a cell block? You deserve to die a slow death like your friend. [ Gun Cocks ] Your silent alarm went off. It certainly did. We have a trespasser. Your gun. [ Gunshot ] Oh! [ Gunshots ] Go. [ Engine Starts ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunting ] [ Grunting Continues ] Say good-bye, asshole. I don't like being called asshole. I could have made you more money than you ever could have spent. This isn't about money. - Than you ever could have spent in your life. - I want my friend back! [ Gunshot ] All right. Come on. Come on. [ Grunts ] Okay. Okay. All right. Look at you. You're pathetic. Come on. Come on! Things I do for love. You're finished. [ Gunshot ] [ Sirens Wailing ] [ Tires Screech ] [ Police Radio Chatter ] This is the second time you've saved my life. Under different circumstances I'd give you a hug. High five. Thanks. You know, that is the third dude I whacked for you this week. Can't wait till next week. Yeah, me neither. - Does it hurt? - A little bit. Yeah, first one always does, but it gets easier. You've been shot? Oh, yeah. Yeah, a few times. Yep. So, I don't know about you, but I'm kind of hungry. I was thinking maybe we'd stop by this burger joint on the way home. And you probably shouldn't stay in your place. It's all messed up. Stay at mine. I'll do the couch. That way I can keep an eye on you. - My place is right next door. - All right, I'll stay there. Whatever. You know, I was thinking about, uh, probably getting away this weekend, renting a camper, going up north, doing some fishing. So, you know, you've been through a lot. If I'm not out of the hospital, maybe. Yeah. I guess we could stay at the hospital too. Whatever. They have pretty good food there too. You know, whatever. Whatever you want, I'm there for you. You know, good times. ** [ Strumming ] Thank you. Mmm. Mmm. It's nice, right? It's good. Really good. Hey, what's up? Hi. ** [ Nocturne #2 ] Bryan? I was hoping you'd still be here. But I thought they killed you. [ Gasping ] Changed my look. Got into shape. Learned how to defend myself. Became focused. Bryan. Oh, Bryan. Near-death experience changes a man. Gave me a purpose. Came back for you. [ Cries ] Alex. I just got to say, man, thank you for helping me get on with my life. Well, you're welcome. Ashley would've wanted it, man. No problem. Yeah. And, Heather, uh, there's a lot of rumors going around about soft erections. Don't believe 'em. Now that I'm back on the market, a catch like me's not gonna last long. So if you want to make your move, now would be the time. All right. All right. You've made your move. Okay. Okay, okay. [ Sighs ] Alex, how could you give all this up? It's starting to grow on me. I think we got ourselves an ending. Yeah, I believe we do. You're not gonna leave me again, are you? The sun will rise and set with you.
