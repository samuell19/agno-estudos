Take these up to grandma, Karl. I'll come later. It'll be alright, chum. Don't worry. The mgp mission Hi, god. You can't seriously want me to move away from this. You'll have to help me. This was Karl from hvide sande, Denmark. Cool. That was megacool. Completely different, right? - Right. Who's next? - Next up is Susan. Susan? - Sawsan, maybe? - Sawsan. Sorry. Come up here. And you brought a guitar. Great. I'm looking forward to hearing your song. Karl... - Karl, would you mind? - What? On. I'm going to miss those, mum. I think you'll miss more than that, my dear. Probably. But it's not my fault the company is moving to Copenhagen. - There are other jobs here. - Yes. At the factory or the grill bar. - So what? - I studied for five years. - I'm not working in a grill bar. - Let's just eat now. It's our last evening together. Karl, dinner's ready. - Would you like some more? - No, thanks. - Sorry, sorry. I know. - If you know, why didn't you come? Because I've been to... it's mad. I'm going to the mgp audition! - The mgp audition? - They took my song at the workshop. - Who stole your song? - They didn't steal it. They chose it. It's the mgp. The junior singing competition. - Maybe I'll be a part of it. - Sawsan is going to be on TV! - Ontv? - Yes, baba. Copenhagen isn't all punks and muslims. Karl belongs here. He was christened here. So was I. Denmark is more than hvide sande. - Let's eat now. - Thanks, mum. It's delicious. - Sawsan, open the door. - Clear off. I hate you! Sawsan, you're 12 years old. 12-year-old girls shouldn't wear makeup and wriggle their bums - - in front of everyone. That's not why I gave you a guitar. - Here you are. - What should I do with it? Burn it or dump it. I don't care! Jamillah... Jimmy says we'll be there around 4 or 4:30. He was going over with a big load anyway - - so he agreed to take my stuff as well. - Hey, god. Are you awake? - See you. Eva, I'm afraid I can't fit it all in. I'm going to Copenhagen in a month or so. I can bring the rest over. - If you can do without it? - Yeah, that's fine. Thanks. Here, son. So you don't forget your roots. See you soon. Copenhagen isn't that far away after all. - Goodbye, Eva. - Bye, dad. - Bye, mum. - Take care, little Karl. Yes. Come on, god. Bad aim. Really bad aim. - Hi, sawsan. - Hi, uncle. Good morning. Welcome to Copenhagen. - It's ugly here. Really ugly. - You're right in the thick of it. Do you know how difficult it is to find a flat here? My word ...! They're crazy. This is a nice place. I feel at home. Excuse me. Your room is bigger than the one in hvide sande. Quite a lot. Or maybe the same size. I know what we have to do. Get you some new furniture. - You've deserved that. - I'd rather have a stereo mixer. Well, if you can do music on the floor... Karl? Come and see the backyard. - It's really big and green. - Wow. It's got trees and everything. There's a barbecue as well. Honestly, god. Can't you see I can't live here? I'm going home. I don't care what you say. Amen. This was Karl from hvide... Good morning, kids. Sit down. Sit down and be quiet. Sit down on your bums. Walid, sit down. This is Karl. He's moved here from jutland. - Say "hi, Karl." - Hi, Karl. Please don't be nasty to him. I know it's hard. - But you said we were all devils. - I've never said such a thing. - Did he say it, or didn't he? - If I did, you must have deserved it. Now that you're standing up anyway, you can show Karl around. - Does it have to be me? - Yes, it does. You go with sawsan. The rest of you, go to page 4 in your Danish book. Girls' gym. Boys' gym. School crossing patrol. Lost items. School yard. - Woodwork. Eat bar. - Eat what? Food... needlework. Office. - Home economics. - Hi. - Music. - Hey, let's go in. - I hate music. - I make my own music. Congratulations. Are you coming? Copenhagen, odense, esbjerg. 418 kroner! What are you doing? - A new mix. Do you want to hear? - A bit later, okay? - Here's 100 kroner. - Mum... Couldn't we raise my pocket money to 150 kroner a month? I think 100 is reasonable. You said yourself that everything's more expensive over here. Yes, that's right. We'll say 150, then. But then the dishwasher has to be empty when I come home. Okay. We'll settle in fine here. We just have to get used to everything. Don't you agree? - Okay, friends. Verbs? - I dance with nadja. - I danced, I have danced. - Really good, jasmina. - Mian? - To shoot. I shoot hussom. I shooted hussom. I have shooted hussom. - You can't hit anything. - I'll smash you. It's "il shot" and "I have shot". Apart from that, really good. But no one here is going to shoot anybody. Agreed? Karl? I run, I ran, I've run. Good, Karl. It's great to have a dialect, but it should be "I have run". Like that. - Sawsan? - To be bored. I'm bored. I've always been bored in sgren's classes. - Ouch! Stop that. - What did you say, you little shit? - The queue starts there. - "The queue starts there." - Not for us, jerk. - We don't have time to queue. - You've got interval. - We don't queue, get it? - Careful! - Stop it, mian. He's new. Shut up and stay out of it, janem. Don't tell me to shut up. And never ever call me "janem". Come on, Karl. - Get a grip, mian. - Shut your mouth. - What does "jamen" mean? - Janem. It means "girlfriend" or "darling". And I'm not his girlfriend. You have to change your dialect, or they'll never leave you alone. - But that's the way I speak. - Maybe at home. Not here. Okay. Or don't you say that either? Well, it's no co-op. But let's see what they've got. They look alright. Excuse me? Can laskyou... What's in the sausages? - Those ones? - Yeah. Not pork, that's for sure. As for the rest, only Allah knows. Well, we'll try them. That's not too bad. - It tastes of pooh. - Yeah. It's an acquired taste. Give it to me. - Let's go to the pizzeria. - Yes! You seem happier. Have you got some friends at school? - No, not really. - You have to open up. I know you've only been there for 3 weeks, but there are danes as well. - They're all danes. - You know what I mean. My name is sawsan. I'm from ngrrebro, Copenhagen, Denmark. - Earth, the solar system... - Fine. Sit down and get going. - What? I was already going. - No, you weren't. - What should we ask? - Use the questionnaire. - Where are you from? Your parents? - It's boring. No, it's not. I'm from Denmark. And you're from... - Iran. - Iran, exactly. And you're from ...? - Somalia. Right. - And some are from jutland. And jutland is part of Denmark, right? Get going. - Where were you born? - Hvide sande. That's what it's called. Between the sea and the inlet. - For sure... - What about you? I was born in Copenhagen, and so were my parents. But my family are from Turkey. "What's a typical dish from your home country?" Fish. Loads of fish. We eat a lot of that. Imagine if we looked with our hearts imagine if we followed our dreams imagine if anything was possible look at me where there's a will there's a way seemeas/I am... - And you say you hate music? - Yes. So what? Who's it by? The song you just played? - Oh. I wrote it myself. - Seriously? It's brilliant. - Thanks. - With a good beat, it would be... Hey... why don't you send it in to the mgp? I did. And they picked me, if you must know. - Just for the audition. - Maybe you'll be in it. No, I won't. - My dad won't let me. - But what if they pick you? Forget it. When my dad says no, there's nothing to do. Want to join me? We're going the same way. - You've become my bodyguard. - Anything to annoy my daft cousin. - Is he your cousin? - Yes. - When is the audition? - Forget it. It's a great song. The mgp people think so as well. - What a drag. - "Drag"? What's that gibberish? - When is the audition? - Drop it. What would happen if you just tried it out and saw what happened? Look, the police! - Never seen a police car before? - It had the sirens on. Jeez, what a hick. They were just going to the baker's. - With the sirens on? - How are we gonna make you fit in? Come on. You're funny, you know. We'll take a shortcut here. - Hi, uncle. - Hi. Say hi to the family. - Can you just take apples? - Who knows? I've never asked. - Hey. - Hi, sawsan. Look. We're almost home. - Are you going to do it? - We'll see. I know, mum. But it's worse than I'd imagined. I went to the school yesterday. I wonder if the parents' evening will be in Farsi or urdu. Karl? He seems happier. What's... what's up, man? Try and be more singsong. What's up, man? - What's up, man? - No... Listen. What's up, man? Come on, Karl. - Whassupman? - It's not an "upman". Come on! - What's up? What's up, man? - Yes! You can do it. - You need to see the loo phone. - Loo phone? - Where's the phone? - Hello? - Where are you? - Look down. - Surprise! - Hal! Is that the loo phone? That's what we call it. You can hear everything in here - - so be careful what you say when you're in the loo. - Are you going to that audition? - Did you say you could make a beat? - Something like this. - Cool. - It's really cool. - Yeah. It just needs some more bass. Do you have other names than Karl? It doesn't roll off the tongue. - That's what I'm called. - Well, maybe you've got a nickname. My mum and my granddad have a nickname for me, but it's stupid. - Let's hear it, let's hear it. - Okay. - Chum. - "Chum"? - It means "buddy". - Chum... we'll take that. Chum, chum, chum... Wait out there. Can't I just come up? We'll tell them you said I could borrow it. It's not so good, chum. - Can't you lend me your guitar? - Yes, of course. It's just... - Never mind. - Can't you bring friends home? Yes. It just has to be arranged beforehand. But why? You're a boy, chum. I can't have boyfriends. - I'm not your boyfriend. - No! But tell that to my grandma. Hi, darling. Is that burek? It looks delicious. Hands off! - It's not for lunch. - Hi, dad. - Are you on evening duty today? - Yes, unfortunately. - How's school? - Alright. We're doing a project in sgren's class about where we're from. - Not for lunch. - The kitchen police... - How big was grandma's village? - About 50 families, I think. - 40. - 30. - What a load of Hicks. - Don't diss your roots. Sawsan? Isn't that the boy from your class? - What's he doing here? - That's Karl. He lives close by. I know he's a boy. Relax! I'm going to do my homework. - Speak nicely to grandma. - I love you too. - Yes, speak nicely... - Kumail, bring it back. Right now! Come on. Hurry up. - See you tomorrow. - No, not that way. Along the hedge. My grandma sees everything. - You're coming in, right? - No, I'll wait out here. You'll be fine. Wait... you need the beat. They probably have a sound engineer. Chum. Okay, god... you haven't been of much help lately. But a wee audition can't be too difficult for you. - Are you finished already? - Yes. Completely finished. - What happened? - You need your parents there. - I didn't think of that. - They said I could get one of them. - I knew this was a bad idea. - What are you going to do? Yeah, what? I can't just conjure up a dad, you know. No, that's... Wait a minute. Maybe I can. Who do you want me to play? Damn it, sawsan. - You're mad. - What is it? - They don't know about me and laerke. - What? Okay. I'll do it. When is it? Right now? Haven't you told them? About me? Yes. Of course I have. They picked it! My song is one of the ten in the competition! - That's so cool! - It's just crazy! They loved your beat. Tarek! Thank you, thank you. You're welcome. You blackmailer. But I wasn't here today. Don't say anything at home. - You're going to be in the mgp! - No way, chum. It's in herning, jutland. No go. - But I can still be proud. - You have to go. - We'll think of something. Or I will. - You're great, chum. That would be lovely, dad. We really need that table. The weekend's perfect. They don't use the Van in the weekends, do they? Okay. No, I won't say anything yet. I don't want him to get disappointed. Hi, sweetheart. Have you had a good day? Whose guitar is that? Herning, herning, herning... Herning, here. From esbjerg to herning and then... - Sawsan... - Go away. Stay away from me! - But why? - Right, I'm here. Come on. Loser! What? - How are things? - Stop it. In the middle ages, people lived together in small villages. Seren? Can I go to the toilet, please? - Yes, okay. - The women stayed at home... - Seren? - Yes? - May I leave the room as well? - Yeah, off you go. - Sgren? I need to go as well. - That's it! Are the middle ages that boring or what? Do you really need to go? Okay, then. Be quick. Someone saw us hugging at the mgp. They think you're my boyfriend. I've been grounded for a month, and I'm not allow to see you. But I just figured out how to get to herning. You're crazy. I'm not allowed to go to school on my own. Let alone jutland. - You have to be in that competition. - Yes, but how? - We'll leave Friday morning. - This Friday? - No, when mgp is on. - Oh, yeah. Of course. No one will notice we're gone until Friday afternoon. - But how are we going to get there? - They do have trains in jutland. - Yes, and they cost money. - Relax. I've got it under control. Who are you talking with? With Allah, you big jerk. Is that forbidden as well? - What are you doing in the girls' loo? - Don't be cheeky. Your dad asked me to keep an eye on you. I'm in charge of you. Come here. "Let's do it." Yes! When you and dad were together, would you do anything for him? I think so. That's the nature of love. - Even if it was something bad? - What do you mean? - If you had to scare or hurt someone? - Hurting people can be unavoidable. But if you do it with a pure heart, I think god will understand. - Why aren't you and dad together? - It's a long story, Karl. It just didn't work out. - But granddad says that the Bible... - Switch off the water. - I always forget. - That's it. He says that what god has joined together, let no man put asunder. That's true. But sometimes you have to do certain things - - even if they're otherwise wrong. I think god will understand. Off to bed. Good night. It's over, chum. There's a full-day rehearsal on Wednesday. - Can't you just cancel? - As if. Wait a minute. Maybe I can, if we put the pressure on them. - I need your mobile. - Where's yours? My dad took it. "Until the danger has passed." - You can have it in the schoolyard. - Are you mad? Mian will see it. What about tonight? - I'm going over to Mathias'. - Who's Mathias? - A boy from my class. - It's late already. Yeah, but we're becoming friends. - Are you going to play ninjas? - Something like that. Have a good time, then. But don't get too silly. - Bye-bye. - Bye. Finally! I'm freezing my butt off. Have you got it? - Got what? - The mobile, you twit. - Fuck... I forgot. - You can't be serious. - Damn it, chum. - Of course not. Here it is. I was ready to slap you. Hello, this is jamillah yilmaz. Sorry for calling so late. My daughter sawsan is in the music competition. We can't come on Wednesday. We have to earn money. If you throw my daughter out, I'll complain to the prime minister. - Yes, we can come on the day. - Sawsan? - Are you talking to yourself? - I can't talk to anyone else. - All my human rights are violated. - It's cold. Come inside. I'm not cold. Can't you let me stay out here, damn it? - Fuck. She was right next to me! - I know. I was there. I got out of the rehearsal. They didn't want to force my mum. - Give me your mobile again. - Why? My dad. In herning, that is... Hi, tarek. I'm going to need you again, on Friday the 22nd. - The 22nd? - Yes, and the 23rd. Sorry, sawsan. I'm in jutland for the whole of that weekend. He's in jutland anyway! Tarek, you're my favourite cousin. You know that? Alright. "Computer". U-t-e-r. We can all spell that. How about a harder word? - Transformator. - Good word. Who can spell that? - Fatima? - Yes. T-r... - Sgren? May I go to the toilet? - You have to pee again? - One minute. - Be quick. - Saren, I have to go as well. - Off you go, then. Hurry up, you two. - No, I can wait. - Good. Go ahead, Fatima. - Could you give this to sawsan? - Come on. We're waiting. - I'm brushing my teeth. - Mum, say something. Relax, girls. There's no stress. The contestants Fuck this. I've told you not to interfere with the girls. - But it's important. - Listen to your mum, kumail. I've listened to her for 40 years. Yeah, yeah, whatever. Honestly... couldn't you just talk to her? She wanted to say something. - Why do you move these cables? - You're changing the subject. Jamillah? I love you. Good night, sweetheart. Whoops... What's this hiding under here? Cinema tickets! Which film are we going to see? That's up to you. We'll do the whole thing tomorrow. Drinks and popcorn. - Tomorrow? - Yes. I'm going to leave early. - Isn't it great? - I can't do it tomorrow. - Why not? - I have a presentation in school. - Sgren says we have to come. - Oh. That's too bad. We'll just do it another day. Good night. Mum? Thanks a lot. Hi, god. It was only a small lie. Sawsan has to sing her song. Okay? Amen. This was Karl from Copenhagen, Denmark. I hope you agree. See you. We've got a meeting, so I have to go. Do you need anything? - Everything's under control. - Is it? My little copenhagener... Remember you have to leave in ten minutes. Bye-bye. Ouch! My stomach. Can I go down for a minute? - You know where it is. - Ouch... Off you go. Come on. Nana... - Come on. - Fuck! - Mian, come on. Quickly! - Wait! There they are! The train's there. Come on. - Shit! - Relax. We'll take the next one. Where is she? This can't be happening. We have to get them. There! - Do you think we'll make it? - We've got plenty of time. - Are you excited? - Yeah. You bet. Platform 7. Hurry. It's leaving in a few moments. There they are! This is it. That's it. We're gone till Sunday. Come on. Hurry! - It's a family thing, Emil. Okay? - Yeah, alright. We've run away from home. It's insane! We're doing it so you can sing your song. That's not wrong. Tell that to my dad. I've broken ten important rules in the koran. - Or twenty. - So have I. - Christian ones, I mean. - Honestly, chum... - Christians can do anything. - That's not true. - There's loads of things we can't do. - Like what? - We can't steal. - Nobody can steal. - Give me a better one. - Okay... - We can't lie. - Wow, great. - And you think we can? - No, of course not. What are you doing? I need to pass. - Come on. - We can't move right now. - That's your problem, not mine. - No, itisn't. Excuse me. Could I get out for a second? Thank you. Out of order There she is! - Sorry. Get up, chum! - Fuck... - What about all our stuff? - Never mind. - Come on, Carl! - Wait. Hurry, Carl! In here. We've got them. Come on. Open up! We know you're in there. What's going on here? - Hey. - Hi, jamillah. What's up? - Have you found her? - Who? - Sawsan. She's been gone for hours. - I thought she was in school? No, she left. I thought you knew. Why haven't you called me? I'll call you. - We can't keep hiding on this train. - No. - We'll get off at the next stop. - When is that? Amne... hey! What's going on with sawsan? Gone? She can't just be gone. Oh ...! Sawsan is also kumail's daughter, and you brought him up. I'll call him. - Where do you think you're going? - That's none of your business! - Let me go! - Mian, come. I've got sawsan. Hold on. I'm coming. Let me go! Get your hands off. There you are. May I see your tickets, please? Thank you. - That's fine. And you? - We don't have time, bitch. Oh, I think you do, buddy. - Well... - Bye. Have a nice trip home! - Where are you going? - Copenhagen. Thanks a lot. You were supposed to guard her, mum! I'm not listening to this. Yeah, yeah... She's right, dad. You always tell her to mind her own business. I'll go and check if she's in school. - Jamillah... it's your daughter. - Don't get started now. Hop on board. Hvide sande smokehouse what are a couple of sticklebacks like yourselves doing out here? - We're on our way to herning. - You're going off course, then. - I'm going to vejle. - That's fine. It's still closer. Chum... you speak gibberish! And I thought the thing you spoke at school was jutlandic. It's weird, but I think I've seen you before. Baba... She hasn't been to school today. Cousin mian hasn't been to school either today. - You think she ran off with him? - Mian? Honestly, mum. Sawsan thinks he's gross and stupid. - Hey! He's not stupid. - Come on. He's thick as a plank. What are we going to do? Where can she be? The Danish boy hasn't been in school either, by the way. I know! You're Magnus' lad, aren't you? That's right. My mum and I moved away three months ago. I knew I'd seen you before. What a coincidence, eh? Picking up a fellow-townsman out here on the road. But what in the blue moon are you going to herning for? - What was that thing with the moon? - He's asking about herning. - I'm going to the mgp in herning. - Mg what? It's a music competition for children. Sawsan is going to sing her own song. - She's in the final! - Well, I'd never... I've got a proper celebrity in my Van. - Could I hear a bit of the song? - No, I'd rather not. You know what? If you sing the song for me, I'll take you all the way to herning. - Hi, dad. - Hi, my dear. Gosh. It looks like Palestine around here. - My god... what a lot! - God's got nothing to do with it. - I'm impressed. Good driving. - I didn't just fall off the Van... - How high up are you? - Second floor. Come on. Karl might be home already. - And remember to lock the door. - Oh... Copenhagen! You know what, sousa? I think you're going to win that x factor thing. - Mgp! - Yes, that as well. I'll vote for you, that's for sure. And get the wife to do it as well. - When is it on? - It's on live tomorrow evening. The dress rehearsal is today, so sawsan has to be there. Live? Oh, boy... And dress rehearsal tonight? Let's put the pedal to the metal. Humans weren't meant to live on top of each other. I'll make some coffee. "A secret mission"? It's from Karl. He says he's gone on a secret mission. It says I shouldn't worry. He'll be home soon. The boy's got a vivid imagination. I can't wait to see him. - Thanks for the help. - You're welcome, my dear. I wanna buy a cow that's mine it should be big and also fine giant udder, long teats and an arse full of treats and then when it goes "moo" I'll take my glass and drink it too. What do you say to that? Maybe I should try signing up - - for that song quiz as well... - She's planned it all. - Yes. Look at this. "Dear mum and dad, I've gone on a mission." "Please forgive me. I had to do it. Don't worry about me. Sawsan." Mum! Now make sure you win that "survivor" thing. Karl? When you come home, say hi to your family from me. Say it's from Kurt "the crazy cleaning cloth". They'll know. - Kurt "the crazy cleaning cloth"? - Yes, it's... it's a long story. Get going. Break a leg. You're here! I was afraid you might have forgotten. Forgotten? Are you mad? Listen... I haven't slept for three nights. Sawsan... I can't do it. What? - But you're here. - The audition was one thing. But this is going to be on TV. Laerke thinks I should do it. But she doesn't understand it. Going up against your dad. It's your dad... - Tell them about us, if you want to. - I'd never do that. Please help us. Just this once. - The trip was really tough. - People were chasing us. - Really tough. - Come on, honey. Sorry. Good luck in there. - I'm sorry about this. - Come on, sawsan. - What do you want us to do? - I don't know. Just come on. You're a bit late, so dump off your bags and go straight to the stage. I just need your parents' signatures. Where are they? They're parking the car. Can't it wait? I can sign it. I'm her brother. - You two are siblings? - Yes... Our mum is Danish, and our dad is turkish. Genes, you know... - They can be pretty unpredictable. - I have to make a phone call. Oh, good. There you are. We had to park the car. Do you need me to sign? Of course. That's great. Two rooms, then. You can have this one. And you can sleep with your brother, right? - Of course. - You'd better go to the stage now. - What are you doing? - I'm sorry. I don't understand it. Why doesn't he answer his mobile? Something is very wrong here. Maybe he's gone home with a friend. Don't they do that over here as well? - Does he have any friends? - Yes, there's a boy called Mathias. - What did you have for breakfast? - I had some yoghurt... Can you hear that, chum? My name is sawsan. I'm 12 years old. One, two, three... You're not allowed in here during rehearsals. Please go out. No, Karl. Yes, from school. He was over at your place the other night. This is Mathias from 6b, isn't it? Sorry, I'm just very confused. Camera 3 is active. Cam 3,4 ..And 7. She says Karl and Mathias have never played together. Mothers don't necessarily know everything. But he told me that... this is crazy. What's happening? There he is. Thank god! - Karl, where have you been ...? - Your son has kidnapped my daughter. - You heard me. - Sorry, but sawsan is gone. - She wrote something about a mission. - And she's not allowed to! Please come in. I don't understand this at all. Karl also left a note. I hope they're alright. They must be tired and hungry. - Look at these. - Oh, yeah! - And here. - Look at the ones over here. I've never seen so much food in my life. - What about tarek and laerke? - They stayed in the room. They don't want to be seen. And they're together, of course. - So they haven't been to school? - No. Well, we know that they haven't been kidnapped or anything. They planned it themselves. Then it's not too bad. "Not too bad"? My daughter has run off with your son! Imagine if they'd been taken by criminals. Why don't we start looking? - Or do you want to keep yapping on? - Dad ...! We need to think. - We need some food to think. - I'll give you a hand. There's some chicken. And... no, that's too sour. - You're assembling a cupboard? - Yes. - Give me that. - No, it goes outwards... - Give me that thing! - Let me have a go first. Food's ready. - Is it food? - That's so sweet. And napkins as well. - Thanks. Come on, honey. - Tarek? - Yes? - Thank you. - What the devil is that mission? - The devil isn't involved. Yes, he is! Where the devil are they? What the devil are they doing? - Where do they normally meet? - In school. If she's lying in there with Karl, I don't know what I'm going to do. In hvide sande we would've got henning. - Don't they have a janitor? - There's only one way, then. - Dad, what are you doing? - Relax. Kumail is a locksmith. Fuck! - Yilmaz, is that with a z7? - Yes, like Zorro. Y-i-l-m-a-z. - It's not going to be cheap. - Never mind. What about the kids? We're employing extra people, and we'll send out a description. - Did you have some pictures? - Yes. This is Karl. And this is sawsan. - How old did you say she was? - She still looks like that. More or less. How cool! Oh no, chum. That's it. It's a nice construction, but I could have just looked away. Chum... don't you get it by now? If my dad finds out that I'm lying here with you... But he doesn't know. I'm not going to tell him. Neither is tarek. I know. It's just the principle. Get under the duvet. I'm going to the bathroom. - All the way. I can see your hair. - Yes, but it can't see you. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. I've talked to the police. There's still no sign of them. - They'll notify the media now. - Oh, no. - It has to be done, kumail. - I'm just thinking of my little girl. The good lord is looking after them. They're asleep somewhere. - Fuck, we overslept! - What is it? - Get under the duvet! - Yeah. Relax. I forgot to say... - Relax. I'm dressed. - Yes, but I'm not. Family briefing in an hour, okay? During the show, you can't leave, so go to the toilet beforehand. We're filming you as well. But just try to look natural and happy. We're filming you in close-up when your child is on stage. - I have to go to the loo. - Okay. Be quick. If your child has reached the final, you're going to the green room. Yesterday before school. The police believe they're still together. What? Yes? Hey... We know where they are. In hvide sande. Are you sure? I've just had firm evidence that they're in jutland. - Hvide sande is in jutland. - Oh, yeah. Two children from narrebro in Copenhagen are missing. Sawsan yilmaz and her classmate Karl hajby Hansen, both 12 years old. Are we going in that one all the way to jutland? Kumail, take it down a notch. She's looked like that for years. She can survive another trip. There's only room for three in the front. Someone has to hide under the blanket in the back, in case we get pulled over. Jamillah. Please. All ready? - My back! - Where did you go? Sawsan... sawsan! Chum... what are you doing? - Come here. Look. - The children were last seen... - Was that the news? - No, the royal theatre. Yes, of course it was the news. Now we're both TV stars. - It doesn't matter. - No? This is mad. It's an old car. You're stretching the gears too much. - I know how to drive it. - I drive a Van every day. - It's the snow. - What's that got to do with it? It wasn't warmed up, and then the thermostate... Is this breakdown assistance? We need some help. How do we explain to the TV crew that your hair is suddenly black? - They already think we're strange. - It's easier to hide from 25 people. Just promise me that we're ready to start in 70 minutes. Than from 25.000 in the audience. You're going on in a few hours. - I'll hide until then. - Okay. I'll go to the makeup room. It's ready to go again. But I can't guarantee for how long. Be careful not to stretch the gears with an old banger like that. Were you going to hvide sande? Then I would suggest - - that you go via herning... - That's a detour. - Well, the road is better. And there's less snow. Of course, you could also choose... - You've got fantastic hair. - Thanks. - Your parents are going to be proud. - Yes... Sawsan, can I see you afterwards? - Where's Karl? - I don't know. He ought to come in here as well. Hello! Haven't I seen you before? - No, I don't think so. - You're from sawsan's family, right? - Oh... yes. - Get to your seat. We're starting. - Standby. - Have a great show. 10secs. 9,8,7,6... 54, 3,21... - Start broadcasting. - Ladies and gentlemen... Welcome to mgp! Welcome to our viewers and to all the children and parents here tonight. Hi, mum. No, not yet. We'll be there in an hour or so. Thank you very much. Now, on with the show. For all the flabbergasted flounders ...! Get in here, natamon. That's the girl I told you about. Yes. Kurt "the crazy cleaning cloth"? What does he know about that? Herning? We've just passed herning. Are they in "bought and sold"? What a load of rubbish. What have you done to it? Now's your last chance to vote for your favourite song. What's so terrible about your daughter singing a song on TV? Little girls shouldn't be made up like lady gaga and look like pornstars. He's got a point. Boys with punk hairdos and girls with no clothes... All that TV nonsense is pure devilry. Stop it, dad. TV is TV. It's not the end of the world. Let me ask... Herning, are you ready? We need to find out which three songs are going to the final round. Isn't that the boy from the news, but with different hair? Right there. - Look, mum. He's leaving. - Karl? Yes. What? - Right now? - What's happening? They said congratulations. Sawsan is singing again. - She's in the final round. - Great. Congratulations. - Sawsan. - Chum... I'm in the final round! It's just fantastic. Thank you so much. - Hurry down to your seat. - See you later. - It's the boy from the news. - Are you sure it's him? - Yes, definitely. - He left. Here's our second finalist... Unless you want me to sue you, put me through now. My daughter is in the competition without my permission. Yes, I'll hold. - Kumail, let's think about this. - Think? I have to protect her! I'm sawsan's dad. My daughter is in your show without my permission. - Standby. - We can't stop now. - We have to. Her dad just called. - Please be quiet. Kim, this is serious. Her dad is furious. - The viewers will go mad. - Please go outside. We're working. Listen to what I'm saying. It's no good ...! She's on after the next song. There's no time to ask anybody. She's already been on once. Can't we say there was no time to stop her? No, that won't work. It's easy to check when her dad called. I don't want to risk it. We might get sued and everything. Tell szhirley not to introduce sawsan at all. No explanations. We'll drop the last song and go straight to the counting. Thorkild? We've found a solution. - Come here, sawsan. - What's happening? We've been found out. You won't be allowed to sing. Do exactly as I tell you. Come on. That was stardust with "dancing on the milky way". - My daughter is in the show. - It's true. Listen to me. You're not coming in without tickets. - She's... she's not coming. - She's left the competition. Sawsan and her song "look at me" is out. Instead, we're going straight to the voting. - Come on. - But he just said I was out. Go in there and sing your song. Now! We're going on to the actual voting. Is that correct? No, here's... Here's sawsan after all! What the hell is happening? What are we going to do? We're producing TV. Camera 2, continue as planned. Live TV... I love jt! Here here it's only me all that you see of me no facade and no pretense look beyond clothes and style at what's inside all the things that the world overlooks imagine if we looked with our hearts imagine if we followed our dreams imagine if anything was possible... It's her. It's our sawsan. Show me who you are together, we'll fly high up in the sky... My son is in there as well. Thank you. See me as I am together we'll fly high up in the sky to the stars and back again now everything's clear to me this is a hew start and I'm not holding anything back imagine if we looked with our hearts imagine if we followed our dreams imagine if anything was possible look at me where there's a will there's a way... Come. Let's go find Karl. High up in the sky to the stars and back again I'm showing you the truth behind me see me as I am together we'll fly Dolly... and go! The girl you see is not who I am there's so much more under the surface behind the facade they'll see me now look at me where there's a will there's a way show me who you are together we'll fly what are you doing, tarek? I'm showing you the truth behind me see me as I am together we'll fly high up in the sky to the stars and back again. That wasn't so bad, kumail. There she is! - Come over here. Well done. - Karl! - Our three finalists... - Mum! Granddad! The atmosphere tonight is just amazing. Mia, what's the atmosphere like up there in the green room? What's the atmosphere like, everybody?
