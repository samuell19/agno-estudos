[siren wailing] How bad is this hit and run? I don't know Billy. I only been down here. Victim in the hospital? The body's up the road a piece. Near the church, they say. Look at that track. Something damaged in the vehicle. Leak or a bent tire rubbing. Take us right to the guy's house. Piece of cake. See ya in a bit. Even though I miss the kids, it's nice to have the house to ourselves sometime, you know? So we can, uh-- No-no-no, huh-uh. R.C., we can't keep God waiting. Woman, I been waiting on you. Come on.

Yes, you can do whatever you want. You a grown woman. Got to go. Official business. See ya at the house later. How you think it happened? First, I thought that when he got hit he got caught up under the vehicle-- Mm-hmm. --that's how come these tracks in the road. His body? May even be worse than that. He had these gouge marks on his ankles. When I come back here where the tracks started and... -Mm-hm. -...then down off onto that logging road there, and looked like a scene of a scuffle. [man groaning] What-what are you saying, Billy? He may have been dragged. [R.C.] Let's see, that's about uh... three miles up to that church. Are you saying that his body was dumped up there? Looks that way to me. Damn. You know who it was? We found a wallet. Checking the fingerprints now. [dramatic music playing] Still no answer. Yeah, that's 'cause he on his way over. Here, put the greens out on the table. Okay. -[Claire] Hi, Daddy. -Hi, baby. Hey. Hey Mama. -Look at you. -Mama. -Have you heard the news? -Where's your brother? Parking just as I walked up. Terrible what we been hearing. You know, Son ain't answering the phone. Probably hung over. Hey Pop. -My boy. -How ya doin'? -Damn good, and you? -I'm alright, I'm alright. -You hungry? -You know that. Hey baby, how ya doin'? -Hey Ma. -[Stella] Hi darling. You hear they beheaded a Black man last night? It passed through your church, too? Mm, stopped the sermon. Now Reverend Lyons told all the young men not to go out alone for now. I think it was revenge. -For that thing last week. -[Thurman] Mm-hm. [Claire] Black man shoots his White boss and somebody's head gets cut off. [James] C'mon it all ain't nothin' but rumor yet. [Stella] Well... y'all wanna eat, or wait for Son? -No, I'm ready to eat now. -No, I ain't waiting. [knocks on door] Oh, wait, there he is. I'm-I'm tired of waiting for him. Can I have the bread, please? [James] Playing his foolishness. Mama, better fix him a plate 'cause you know he's gonna be hungry. Son-- Sheriff Rowles. May-may I come in? Yeah, yeah, come on in. Just eatin' but-- Oh. Afternoon, y'all. You arrest Son again? No, ma'am. I'm afraid I have some bad news. [clears throat] I don't know any easy way to say this. Your son, James Junior, was killed. [James] What- what happened, Sheriff? We don't know all the details. But we have reason to believe he may have been murdered. Oh, daddy. Oh, daddy. Oh, no, God. I give you my solemn promise that I will not sleep until we find out who did this. [dramatic music playing] I think we should all pray together. All right? Let's hold hands. Cigarette butts, baseball cap. Nutdriver. Nutdriver with S.B. engraved in it, and lighter, lighter with Possum on the bottom side and some weird triangle on the top. S.B. think about it now. S.B. S.B. and Possum. Sam Brown. [Billy] Stu Bullock. Son of a bitch must be eighty years old. I doubt it. But good thinking. Listen, we're thinking. -That's the main thing. -[Sgt. Carter] Billy... we got something. Y'all need to hear this. This here's Steven Scott. Go on and tell the sheriff what you told me. Go on now, you can tell him. Steven, is it? Yes, sir. Well, Steven, go 'head tell me. What you got? Around one in the morning I saw James Byrd walking, hitching. Then these men in a truck picked him up. [deputy] And you just happened to be there then, boy Charlie, will you shut your mouth? Steven don't pay n o attention to him. Did you see who it was? They were White. What about the truck, Steven? -What about that truck? -[Sgt Carter] What color was it? It's okay. Light, or white, or tan, or somethin'. Stepside. Mufflers were loud. Well, you done good, Steven, to come here and I wanna thank you for it. Anything else you think about, you get in touch with Sergeant Carter here, okay? You take him in, get a little statement and have him sign it. You got it. Thank you, Steven. That's the first good lead we got. That's a hell of a lead. It's just too easy. I don't trust it. What, you don't think it could be a white man? Okay we got something to go with now. What y'all working on in here? Take a look. S.B. engraved on it. What the heck is this symbol, here? SGT. Shawn Berry. He got hisself a gray primered pickup. That could look light enough. Now here's a man who is thinking on the job. Too bad I promoted you. Yeah, you could do it again. Don't push it. Okay. Shawn Berry lives with Bill King, don't he? That's right. Bill King calls hisself Possum sometimes. -Has them tattoos. -Yeah. This here is a uh, Klu Klux Klan deal. Forget about the triangle. This is three K's with their ends joined together. I think we got us some trouble here. Tell all units to pick up Shawn Berry. This is it now. Here we go. [Mary] Why don't ya go on over and visit the Byrds and... we'll all wait 'til you get back R.C., he'll be here any minute. [R.C.] I know. I know that. You know he probably just stopped to get Mom some flowers. -[R.C.] Right. -[chuckles] [R.C.] You know uh... word is folks are buying guns for their protection and they're gonna patrol this side of town. Lord knows what that's gonna provoke. Go on over to the Byrds'. Boy's gonna be here any minute. It don't help if you keep saying that. You think you the only one worried? Daddy, it's gonna be all right. [Ricky] Something smell good. -What's wrong? -Where you been, boy? -I had me a car trouble. -And did you forget your manners? When you're late, you call. You hear me? -Do you hear me! -I hear ya. I hear ya. [ominous music playing] [James] Now we ain't never gonna figure out why. That's for the police and the courts. And why God chose for this to happen we ain't never gonna know. We just gotta trust and obey him. Now ain't that right? -[Claire] Oh, mama. -Amen, amen. [James] Amen. Amen. Y'all. If ever you need anything, please don't hesitate to-- -Uh, R.C. -[R.C.] Mm? Now sheriff look me in my eye... -Mm-hm. -...told me he was gonna get who did it. But-- Oh, I-- I hear ya. Now, I'm gonna be on top of it. Don't worry about it. Y'hear? Well, it's a lot of talk about guns and revenge. We don't want no more violence, R.C. -Me neither. -We just want you to try to keep the peace no matter what. I'll do it. R.C. Got to make some, uh, some plans for at the funeral. Will you take care of the body, carry him on over to your parlor? You should be the one to do it. He about growed up with your kids. [sobs] Shh. [dramatic music playing] All right. Shh. I'll take care of it. [indistinct chatter] How y'all doin'? [laughter] Need to talk about some things. What things? Why don't y'all come on down to the station? You don't want us to question you here right -in front your friends, now. -[man] We don't care. [man] Yeah, go 'head. [clears throat] Dispatch. Well, we can sit here and wait for this paperwork or you can just come along. [woman] This is Dispatch. Your choice. [woman] Officer, do you need assistance? Come in, Officer? We ain't got no reason not to. Cancel that. [woman] We copy. [man] We'll wait here. Yeah, keep your beer cold for ya. [commentator] Lead down to one, here they come the other way. [Walter] I mean did they know him? Why'd they do it? They're sticking to their story. They were just out driving last night. [Walter] You know, folks are saying they were, uh, they found a note on 'em talkin' about, uh, one down, two to go. Don't know nothin' about that. Billy said when he finds out, he'll let me know. And you're sure there's just the three of 'em. I don't know nothing Walter. Billy just wants me to help reassure the people that suspects are in custody. And are you reassured R.C.? Is Billy up to solving this? And what happens if he isn't? Walter... you're real good on questions. How you fixed for answers tonight? Huh? Mr. Social Activist? Huh? I'm sorry. A'right. Now they're questioning them and they're gonna concentrate on this, uh, boy Berry. He seems to be the weakest link. Now I hate to be rude, but I gotta go to the-- the mortuary. -Oh, you got James' um-- -Oh, yeah. Yeah. [Walter] Oh, that's all right. I got to get home myself. Ruth says she's scared, so... [Billy] Follow my lead. [Guy James] It's your show, Billy. You know who I am? -You're the D.A.? -Well, the sheriff the D.A., they don't come down here in the middle of the night, unless it's awful serious bad trouble. Shawn Berry, look at me straight in the eye. You're so scared you can't even breathe. And you got a good reason, too. You got a damn good reason. You know why? Because we know. We know. We know, man. We know the story, we know-- We know what happened. Now let me share something with you, son. We ain't got a case on them other two. We got no case. But we know they were there. But we got that Black guy's blood on your truck, and we got your tools at the crime scene and right now you are facing a capital murder charge. You got that? Let that just sit with you awhile. Capital murder. And we know son, that you ain't like those other two guys. We know that. I mean look at you. You can't even breathe. But it's gonna be your ass! It's your ass, son. [Guy James] Now if there's any deals to be made, first person to talk usually gets the best treatment. -That right, Billy? -[Billy] That's right. Now you had best think about that. You tell us from the beginning, Shawn. We was driving. [Shawn] Wait. -What deal do I get? -That's all you got to say? That's the only thing you got to say to save your ass? Son, you are up for a capital murder charge. You know what that means? You wanna try this again or not? Now that's a little smarter. Tell me from the beginning, Shawn. [Shawn] We was driving. [sniffs] [car engine revving] [Shawn] We picked up a hitchhiker. -Y'all going into town? -[man] Yeah, man, we're heading into town. -Mind if I hop in? -[man] Sure, why don't you hop -on the back. -Alright. We stopped by ol' Huff Creek. -Want a beer, man? -[James Jr.] Yeah. [man] Alright. King, Brewer. [ominous music playing] [man] Hey man, you want me to open that for you? Yeah. They said they was just gonna whup him and scare him. -[glass shatters] -[man] Fuck, yeah! -[laughing] -[man] Hell yeah! [James Jr. groans] [man] How 'bout that there nigger, huh? [man] Beat the motherfucker up man, hit him. It's the other guys that started it. I tried to leave when they started that other stuff. [James Jr. groans] [Shawn] The other guys had started anyway. [James Jr. screaming] -[man] He looks bout played out. -[man] Yeah, guess he's tired. -[man] Go, get the chain. -[man] Right on. [Shawn] Don't touch me, nigger! Get off! [Shawn] They started chaining him to the truck and I said I didn't think it was such a good idea. [man] Hold that motherfucker still, will ya? [man] Hey boss, we'd all set up here. [man] Alright, alright, let's get going. -[man] Ready? -[man] Yeah, let's go. [James Jr. screaming] [car engine starts] [Shawn] And then we started driving and next thing I knew, I looked back, he was not there. Look we just wanted to fuck with some nigger. Just got outta hand, is all. That's a start. [Billy] One of these days you're gonna wake up in such pain, 'cause of what you done. [door opens] [R.C.] Let us have this room, boy. [man] Yes, sir. -Come to you. -Mm-hm. -Instead of calling ya. -Yeah. -We got us a confession. -Oh, yeah? It was just them three and it was racially motivated. Anything going on between them and James? Just a random victim. I don't know what a hate crime is. I mean, exactly the strict legal wording, but I think that's what we got here. We picked a hell of a time to get elected, didn't we? How many, uh, murders you work on? Just that one last week and now this one. Just two, huh? Right. We don't work no murders in the Highway Patrol. I called the F.B.I. down in Beaumont and I told 'em, I said, "This country boy needs some help." Well, I'm gonna send this body down there, get me some expert autopsy. I'm going down there first thing tomorrow. They're sending agents up here. This ain't gonna fall on us, Mr. Mayor. The Feds is takin' this one over. They damn well better. [dramatic music playing] [camera shutter clicks] [Mike Lout] Good morning Jasper K.J.A.S. Radio bringing you the latest updates. The police have still not released the names of the three white men being held in custody for the death of James Byrd last night. Sources inside the Sheriff's Department refuse to confirm or deny racism as a possible motive for his death. They do confirm however that no charges have been laid, pending further investigation. Sports and weather up next after this classic from 1975. Kathy? I'm almost to the office. Get ready for a surprise. -[Billy] What kind? -Uh-- [Billy] Oh, shit. Sheriff, Sheriff, can you make a comment on what these men are being charged with, sir? Sheriff, Sheriff, are these three men in the Klan, sir? [Billy] I can't make a comment on anything at this time. Sir, do you believe that there are more suspects around, sir? I just gotta get to my office right now. So, uh, Mr. Mayor, is Huff Creek Road, is that in the town or in the county? It's-- It's the county. It sits right on the edge of the city. What that got to do with what happened there down -down the road? -Now, is that maintained using federal funds? I don't rightly know. You're gonna have to ask the City Manager about that. [Bradford] City Manager. And how do I get hold of him? Excuse me? -Kathy, messages? -[Kathy] Whole bunch. -More to come. -Ooh. Sheriff, Don Clark, F.B.I. Houston. Hey, Don. Good to see ya. You're gonna have to hold a press conference. Oh, no, this is your deal now. Not mine. No, we're just up here to help process the evidence. I just come from your office in Beaumont. Until jurisdiction is established, your-- This is a civil rights violation. It's onto you guys. Good to see ya, Don. He's over there at City Hall. That's where all the -all the City Managers are at. -All right, so, uh, -his number will-- -Wait a minute. What does that have to do with what happened -down the road down there? -The Attorney General's Office doesn't think there're enough facts yet for it to fall -under Hate Crime Law. -What kind of facts they need? -Mr. Mayor, Don Clark, F.B.I. -[Billy] I mean the man was killed 'cause of his color, wasn't he? Just 'cause he was Black. It's plain and simple. You heard that son of a bitch. We went to fuck with an N. There's no other reason, and that's why... -it belongs to the F.B.I. -Not necessarily. -Not necessarily? -Still has to be sorted out, Billy. In the meantime you need a press conference. Who's your media person? Look around. I'm just a little bitty outfit. Well, I brought my media guy with me. And based on the facts so far he's drawn up a standard statement. All you have to do is read it. And avoid specific answers. Just say, no comment, that sort of thing. A full spectrum of law enforcement agencies on both the local and federal level are involved in this investigation which will be exhaustive and thorough. But at this juncture it would be premature to speculate beyond the he-inus--heinous nature of the crime as we understand it at this point. Well, you know, given our employment rate, we should be getting, you know, more Section Eight housing funds. Excuse me, Walter. I think you better turn on K.J.A.S. Okay, thank you. Uh, well, I appreciate your sympathy, but I would, uh, prefer housing funds. [Billy] Other than murder-- [Walter] Yeah, well, how long's that gonna take? [Billy] No determination has been made -concerning this issue which-- -Wait. Is that Billy Rowles? --may be brought against the accused pending further investigation of their possible, uh, connection to extremist movements. -That's it. -Sheriff, sheriff, -was this a hate crime? -[camera shutters] -No comment. -[woman] Sheriff, was this racial? We're looking into all this deal. This is a case under investigation. Is there Ku Klux Klan in Jasper? I'm not aware of any Klan... [Thelma] He's not telling the truth. Yeah, well, thank you, Thelma Davis. [reporter] Mayor, what about you? Do you agree with the sheriff? Is there Klan here? [R.C.] Uh, ain't seen any as long as uh, I live here. [Thelma] He always sides with the White man. He ain't nothin' but a Uncle Tom. That's it. That's all we got to say for right now. [all talking at once] [Billy] Don't pay 'em no mind, R.C. [R.C.] Uh, easy to say. Wasn't said to you. [Clark] You did good. [Guy James] Oh, bullshit. That was terrible. [Billy] Are you guys gonna take this thing over or what? [Clark sighs] We can't say yet. [Billy] Sounds like no to me. Then we gotta do this regular folks way. -And that starts with-- -Hey. --talking regular English language. -[Walter] R.C., man. -No one understood -one word of this. Here. -Yeah. [Walter] You okay? Comes with the job. -Hey, Walter. -Billy. -Good to see ya. -[Walter] How ya doin', man? -Was you out there? -No I heard it on the radio. Oh, some shit storm, I'll tell ya. [R.C.] Listen up y'all. This here is Walter Diggles from the Deep East Texas Council of Governments. If we're gonna get stuck with this, we gotta generate some good will. -You bet. -He's a city boy, like some of you all. Used to live in Dallas... 'til he moved back here. R.C., you know what I'm thinkin'? I'm thinkin' that the uh-- we should just give the Affidavit of Probable Cause to all them reporters. What we got to do is get in touch with The Ministers' Alliance. Tell them what we know. Yeah, it's important that we're all united. Uh, and I hope you don't mind Billy but uh, is it okay if, uh-- Agent Clark, is that right? If uh, if he comes along? Oh, hell, I think this thing should be wide open. Why ministers, Mr. Mayor? Well, let me put it this way. Got eight thousand people and forty churches. -That give you a hint? -[chuckles] [Billy] Stick around. Get some religion. -[chuckles] -Real fast. [screaming] Well, you all know, that's the forensics stuff. Now you all know everything that I know. [clears throat] And that's why I believe it's, uh, should be open, wide open between us. Course we ain't gonna go to the press with all this but-- -[whispering] ---shared responsibility. Uh, Sheriff, uh [clears throat] um, excuse me. This is kind of hard to say uh... but before we can uh, uh, do anything you ask and how do we know that those are all the facts? Ain't I always been straight with you? [Clark] Gentlemen, what the sheriff has told you was all anyone knows right now. [Reverend] Look here, if you want us just to go along and say there ain't no problem here, well, there ain't no sense in having this meeting. [Walter] Now there's a time and place for everything now. -Come on. -Hold it now, hold it now. It's time to cool things down now. Everybody gotta stick together. You got to go back to your congregation and tell the folks that the law is on the job. Now don't do nothing foolish. We all have got to stick together here. I uh, I agree with Mayor Horn. [R.C.] All right, now we're in a bind here, y'all. Jasper is in trouble. It could go up just like Los Angeles. You hear me? I need your help. A'right? [Billy] Press time again, R.C.? -You do it, man. -Thank you. Will the men be tried here in Jasper? Actually we don't know that yet. We're gonna do what's best for the case. Are you representing all the people of the town? Y'all need to give these people a chance, now. You know, we know them. They represent us, we live here. It's too early to make a judgment, you know? I mean we got to give time for the system to work. That's all. Or more time to beat around the bush. You know what, you need to be a lot more respectful. -Somebody just died here today. -Walter, how much time? -[reporter] Mayor Horn? -[R.C.] Yeah? [reporter] Is Jasper a racist town? [camera shutter clicks] Now look y'all. And what happened on Sunday, and that was horrible, but that was just three men. That were not the whole town of Jasper. Now we got a lot of Black officials in this town. We got the mayor, we got the City Council Member, we got the School Board Superintendent, Hospital Administrator. Now Blacks and Whites get along here. This is a town about loving each other. Like those men loved Mr. Byrd? [dramatic music playing] [birds chirping] They're looking to crucify us. They come down here looking for rednecks and they damn sure're gonna find them, no matter what. Now that's why we're gonna just keep standing behind ya Billy, -that's all. -You guys know what would've -made this crime federal? -What? If they'd left him right on the church steps, preventing folks their right to worship. But they left him a hundred and seven feet from there. They measured it. Now how close, how close'd it have to be? -Hi Billy. -[R.C.] Hey. -[Billy] Hey buns. -[Jamie] You two-timing me with these fellas? Y'all seeing him more than I do. -[Walter] How ya doin', Jamie? -How's things over in Orange? Whole department's waiting to help y'all. -Appreciate that. -We could use it, I guess. [R.C.] Well, we better leave you two alone. -[Jamie] All right. -Good night y'all. -[Jamie] Good night. -Hey, thanks. -Thanks, guys. -[R.C.] You're welcome. -[sighs] -How you really doing? Can't be worse. [crickets chirping] You gotta be more careful with the reporters, R.C. You don't tell 'em everything's under control if it ain't. If you don't know something, just say, I don't know. But I'm the first to say that I don't know what I'm doing, which could be most of the time, but I'm just a mortuary owner who just got lucky and became mayor. I can't do what you do. Everything we each built here is riding on how this comes out. Everybody's watching to see what we do. [Walter] Yeah. That atrocity shocked the conscience of the country and a strong response is clearly needed. I ask for your thoughts and your prayers to be with the family of Mr. Byrd today, and with the people of that community. [all talking at once] [reporter] Mrs. Byrd, Mr. Byrd, what would you like to see done to them? That they be punished for what they did. Would you like them to get the death penalty? That's up to the law to decide. But they killed your son. Don't you feel hatred towards them? [James] We angry, yes. But we don't hate 'em. What good would it do? No matter what the law decides, this is a test of our faith. We have to keep our faith in God. [reporter] Mr. Byrd, do you uh, do you blame the town-- [Thurman] Hey you know what, we answered enough of your questions. All right, we gotta go. -Come on. -[reporter] Mr. Byrd Jr.... [Thurman] Come on. Excuse me, please. [reporter] Mr. Byrd, one more question? I lived here my whole life. Never feared walking the streets. [reporter] Mrs. Byrd, Mrs. Byrd, would you--would you agree with people who say that things are tough for uh, Blacks here in Jasper? Things are tough for folks all over. [reporter] Mr. Byrd, how do you feel about Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and the others coming to your son's funeral? My son is dead. I don't wanna see his funeral turned into some kind of circus! Move that truck right there, all right, move it! [Walter] Now you know I've been talking to the governor's office and-and all they're concerned about as far as the funeral goes is whether Mr. Gore is gonna show up or not. I don't care if Gore shows up or not. He can stay home. But Mr. Bush cares. And that's the only thing gonna get him down here or anybody out of his office down here. -We got us a little problem. -What's that? You ever met any Black Panthers? Billy, not all Black folks know each other. [clears throat] Well, they're coming in tomorrow from Houston, according to F.B.I. They're planning on patrolling the streets armed. On the day of the funeral? -Cup o' Joe, please. -We gotta figure out what the hell we're gonna do about it. I'll tell ya what, I don't want no Panthers running around here with guns, period. [Guy James] Now we could arrest 'em all, take their guns away, put 'em in jail for this or that. It's a Class A misdemeanor to carry a firearm with intent to cause public alarm. I do not know that that is a good idea. So we just let 'em come in here, armed, walk around town, -protecting the community. -I'm not saying that either. [R.C.] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute. [R.C.] Look. And then now what if, and I'm not saying this is gonna happen, but what if when we go to disarm them and they resist, and one of them rifles goes off and shoots one of us, hm, or worse? Shoots one of the kids in the yard? [Guy James] On the other hand, all it takes is one redneck to go and get his gun and shoot someone 'cause everybody's walking around with their guns, and then we got some serious problems. [Billy] I want a pie, please? [Waitress] It's coming up, baby. R.C., What do you think we oughta do? Can we get some help from the State? -[scoffs] -We already asked them. They're not gonna be behind this if it means taking their guns away. [Billy] Well, all we got left, is to play some poker, hope they don't call our bluff. -Have one of them fries? -Yeah. [grunting] You about as nervous as a cat on a griddle. I thought things would be easier. Say a few speeches, cut a few ribbons, maybe make things a little bit better. I should've listened to y'all. Not let them nominate me. It was a chance to have a Black mayor, Dad. You're the only one folks could agree on. Yeah, right. I beat a town drunk, and a crazy man. If only Mayor Lindsey hadn't retired. Well, he did, and you got it now. What ya gonna do? I don't know. I got to represent the whole town, I know that. Can't speak my own mind. People sayin' old mayor still runs things. Is that what you think, Ricky? -Ricky. -Come on now, Dad. [R.C.] Is that what you think? [Mary] What's wrong with you? [Panther] Move out. Go, go, go, go. Let's go. Go. [upbeat music playing] [Billy] You all can't march in downtown Jasper without a parade permit. And how long is that gonna take? [Billy] About a week. But you're welcome to march once you got one. [Khalid X] We're gonna march today. I know my rights. My constitutional right to assemble, free assembly. This here is just a courtesy visit to let you know what we're going to do. Well, you know he does have a point, about his rights. What if they was to march up here? Would they need a permit? Would they have to have a permit to march up here? In the back streets? No I don't think so. -Be all right with the city. -[R.C.] Yeah-yeah, but uh... you can't go marching by the church. Now you don't wanna upset the family -in their time of grief. -Don't you think that's up to them? They might wanna march with us. Let me just make this one last point, about the guns. You can march with signs if you want to. You can tell us where we can march, but you can't say nothin' about the guns. -[claps] -This here is my N.R.A. membership card.
