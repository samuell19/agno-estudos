You Tube - Video Running Time 02:35:10 You Tube search name - Anarkali - 1953 Blow gently, oh Easterly... for Anarkali rests here With dreams of Salim in her eyes, Anarkali rests here This is the tomb of those martyred for love Blow with respect while you are here, oh breeze Maybe you forget I remember her story I still remember the moment... when she attracted his eye Her beauty stood against the Taj Their love stood up to the regime Salim said, with all his love... to his beloved Anarkali... I shall bring the stars for you, if you so wish I shall abdicate, if you so wish What winds were they that blew then? Salim is no more, nor is Anarkali But this tomb bears testimony to their love Of their labor of love Waiting for the bee... lies here the bud of the pomegranate tree Blow gently, oh Easterly Not every memorial to love is a Taj Mahal. This tomb is a tear from the eyes of lovers... that the world's contempt has not been able to destroy. As someone once said... these ruins have seen Spring earlier. The one who rests here was once the spirit of the Spring. She fell in love with Salim, taking him to be only a soldier. Little did she know that the soldier was the crown prince of Hindustan. True life is his... who gives himself up to someone else... and loses himself in love This Spring, this moment... asks us to fall in love... to make our hearts pine for the beloved Life is unfaithful... so enjoy the pleasures of love, while you can True life is his... who gives himself up to someone else... and loses himself in love My heart is pounding, but that is all right Do not keep a count When again will we have such times for ourselves? When again will we enjoy such lovely nights and days? I implore you... to give yourself up to the pleasure of the moment True life is his... who gives himself up to someone else... and loses himself in love Splendid! Was that a voice or the mesmerizing song of a nightingale? Follow me. I must see who this beautiful girl is... whose voice has enthralled Emperor Akbar. Who are you? Who are you? Who? I beg your pardon for appearing without notice. - How was I to know... - What brings you here? I did not come on my own. It was your voice that drew me here. I'd like you to sing the same song again. Why must I sing it? Sing the song again. Beware, lady! You ask a girl to sing a song and even flex your muscles? - Aren't you ashamed? - I seek forgiveness on his behalf. Indeed! You consider yourself royalty and look down on me! As if you are an Emperor! What can I say to you? - Go away! - What if I refuse to leave? - I'll have to report you. - To whom? To Emperor Akbar. I'll ask him to punish you. Please don't do that. I fear Akbar's sense of justice. - Your Majesty... - What news do you bring? We've looked everywhere for Prince Salim, at your behest. But I wasn't fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of him. Wherever he is, take my orders to him. Mercy, Emperor! Mercy! I've committed a blunder! I've been insolent, Your Majesty I am pleased with you, girl. Very pleased. - You don't mind singing now, do you? - How will I sing? Why not? It's not I who sings. It's my love that sings. It isn't I who dances. It's my heart that dances for someone. And that can happen only when my beloved is with me. Your love is indeed laudable. It is so sacred. Does your beloved love you as much, too? - Much more. - No. - It's true, Your Majesty. He does. - His is a weak love. - He's selfish. - His is a selfless, sacred love. - Do you know why he left? - No, Your Majesty. He was scared of me. So he ran away. If the fear of you can scare him away... my love can bring him back, too. Losers never return. Do not challenge those in love, Emperor. You will lose the bet. May the sanctity of love be preserved Come to me If you do not return... love... might have to hang its head in shame... before the world So, come to me, my love Come to me, oh sweetheart Let's prove to the world the power love wields Let's lay the world at the feet of our love Come to me, oh love. Come to me, sweetheart You'll have to come to indulge me You have loved me. You must keep every promise Let's even stake our lives for the sake of our love Let's lay the world at the feet of our love Come to me, oh love. Come to me, sweetheart Let's face every storm of love together Break every shackle and norm to return to me If you are a true lover, give up everything for your love Let's lay the world at the feet of our love Come to me, oh love. Come to me, sweetheart My beloved is afraid. He waits somewhere Somewhere in the recesses of royalty lies hidden my love Make royalty itself bow to our love Come to me, my love Let's make royalty bow to us Come to me, my love He's here! The lord of my music is here! My love has won! My love has triumphed! - Where is he? - Right before my eyes. Didn't I tell you, Emperor? Do not challenge those in love. You have lost, Emperor! You have lost! I will gladly accept defeat. But can you prove your beloved's presence here? This is the hand that lovingly touches me. These are the feet I kiss. - Do you believe me now, Emperor? - Oh yes, I do. Someone who cowers in such fear can only be your beloved. You must bow before true love, Emperor. Love has triumphed today. And you have been defeated. I bow my head, girl. And the whole of Hindustan... bows to your sacred love. For the first time in my life, I have been humbled today. I realize that there is a power even greater than the throne. The power of love. I shall give you a reward today. As long as the world exists... as long as the name of the Moghuls lives... as long as the names of Babar, Humayun, Akbar and Akbar's courtiers live... your name shall also be remembered by all. Seek! What do you want? The pomegranate flower, Emperor. Bless you! Had you wished, you could have sought Hindustan's treasures... or even my empire from me! But you sought something that is... far more beautiful and immortal than wealth and power! And I shall bestow upon you the wealth, girl. I give you the title of the Pomegranate Flower. You shall be known by this name for as long as the world exists. And people shall admire my tastes for the fine arts. - Long live the Pomegranate Flower. - Long live the Pomegranate Flower. Long live Emperor Akbar. Long live the Moghul kingdom! Do not go away, soldier. Do not go away. Stay right here. I'll be back very soon. - Really? - Oh yes. - You won't be late, will you? - No. I hope I don't keep waiting for you and... Don't you believe me? I do, I do, soldier. Go. - May God protect you. - May God protect you. However, I always dread... you are a soldier and I am a gypsy. If we are separated, it will be difficult for us to meet. No, Nadira. That will never happen. Until you return... my eyes shall be waiting for you. Go on, soldier. Go on. Gulnar? His Majesty is waiting for you. He's angry. That's what I've been waiting here to tell you. I'm grateful to you. To serve you, is my good fortune. - Shekhu hasn't arrived yet, Queen. - He should be here any moment. - Your Majesty... - Where have you been, Shekhu? - What has happened to my child? - I've suffered an injury, Mother It's just a scratch. You must never tell your mother when you're hurt. Mothers have weak hearts. I regret, you could not go out with me today. I happened to see a miracle today. A very strange thing. Have you been to the pomegranate gardens here? Yes. Excuse me, Your Majesty? Your Majesty? - Raja Man Singh... - Yes, Your Majesty? I have just one son. I yearn for him to call me father. But he never seems to forget that I am an Emperor. Brother, is that the son's fault? Or is it the father's? I bring word to His Majesty. The troops are ready. Your Majesty, I await royal orders. Raja Man Singh, I wish to send Prince Salim with you... - on your sojourn through Kabul. - Father! - Your Majesty. - My Lord... you have considered my son worthy... of bearing the burden of the Empire with you. - My son has grown up today. - Our son has grown up today, Queen. It's going to be a very difficult journey, Your Majesty. When there are other daring men, why risk the heir to the throne? However difficult the journey is going to be... to keep one's own son safely protected... while others brave the odds, is an act of selfishness. I can make no concessions to myself. Before winning over nations... Emperors have to first strengthen their hearts. Very well. My son shall go the battlefield and display his valor. - You will, won't you, son? - Mother... He certainly will. Soldier! Soldier! Soldier Where are you, soldier? Where are you? Desires met with disappointment. There was the caravan of Anarkali's shattered joys... and the never-ending search following the separation. The caravan wound its way through the hills, across the deserts... and soon crossed the borders of the empire. If Anarkali pined here... Salim was in agony, tormented by the separation. One night... A golden bird! Grab her! Far away from Hindustan, across the border... watching this sickening sight of perverted men... there rose in Anarkali's heart a cry for her beloved. As they say, a heart reaches out to a heart. Perhaps her agonizing cry would reach Salim's heart. Was I saying anything wrong? Now listen to the mesmerising songs of this nightingale... and watch her tantalizing dance. She is incomparable. She is beyond compare in the whole world! Dance... and show your admirers your beauty. You won't sing? Come to me... come at least now Come to me, save me You who will buy my destiny, come to me Come to me, save me You who will buy my destiny, come to me Love is on auction in the market place Come to me Everyone makes his bid, his eyes filled with lust But I belong to you, although the world does not know The cruel ones who bid for me are naively deceived. Come to me Come to me, save me You who will buy my destiny, come to me My youth is full of desire, beauty and charm Wondrous dreams fill my heart My world is about to be shattered, come to me Come to me, save me You who will buy my destiny, come to me Name the price, gentlemen. - One thousand. - Two thousand. - Three thousand. - Four. - Five. - Six. - Ten thousand. - 15 thousand. - 15 thousand? For this beauty from paradise, just 15,000? Either a king knows the worth of a pearl, or its finder. 15,000, once. 15,000, twice. 50,000! - 60,000! - 70,000! - 80,000! - 100,000! - 110,000! - 200,000! 200,000? Only 200,000 for this beauty from paradise? Where are those who admire beauty? Where are those with large hearts? 200,000! 200,000, going once. 200,000 twice. Sold for 200,000! Welcome, sir. This way, please. Let me go! Leave me alone! My daughter! - Have you seen my daughter? - No, who is she? My daughter, Nadira. The one to whom the Emperor gave the title of Anarkali. - The Emperor? - He gave your daughter a title? She's out of her mind. Feeling shy? All right. Your lovely voice... your eyes that are lowered with modesty... your beauty, your youthfulness... you are incomparable! No, let me go! Mercy! Have mercy on me! Why? Have I inflicted any tyranny on you? I have spent so much money on you. To save you... I've taken on a dozen men. All alone. I didn't even care for my life I won't have you sin. I will marry you. Do you agree? I wish you knew. A woman takes the hand of only one man in her lifetime. He's the one she worships, after God. - Nice excuse you've found to escape. - Please don't think it's an excuse. If you don't believe in my love, you might as well strangle me. You will see that in every cry of agony, I will cry for my beloved. Every word you utter is as beautiful as your body. But it has no effect. If your love is true, why does it not strike my heart? Lord Almighty... you are the protector of those in love. Have mercy on me. Show me the light, Lord. Show me the light. What is love? You shall know when you fall in love When you shed tears, when you smile for love The firefly burns... but for what does he burn? If you must know the secret... you should burn in the fires of love Do not ask me what my love offers me It's a flame that I hide in my heart With love in my heart, with my desires... I have brought the wilderness alive Do not ask me what my love offers me That which the world looks forward to destroying... is a memory I hold to my bosom Do not ask me what my love offers me I swear it on my love, to those that look at me with lustful eyes It is the sweet ache of love for which I've forgotten the world Do not ask me what my love offers me Enough, Anar, enough! My Anar, I'm your soldier! It's me! I'm back! Soldier! - Raja saheb... - Follow me quietly. - Raja saheb... - Your absence... and what I saw here cannot be forgiven. She's the girl upon whom the Emperor bestowed the title of Anarkali. - There's no need to say anything more. - Mercy on our innocent love! Look at her. She's asleep after days of waiting for me. For the sake of my love, she has endured so many atrocities. Have mercy on us, Raja saheb! An empire runs not on mercy. It runs on laws. - The law is your prerogative. - And the Emperor's justice? - You can reason with him. - How about my duties? - And what is your duty? - To take you away from here. - Should I refuse to go? - You will be arrested! And this girl who has driven you to rebel will be killed. In that case, you will take me dead. Not alive! - Prince! This is a rebellion! - This is the justice of love! - Don't compel me to fight back! - You are doing that! Raja Man Singh won't tolerate rebellion! And I can't bear to see my beloved being separated from me! Soldiers! Arrest him! Take him away! Go on. Soldier! Where are you, soldier? Where are you? Nargis! I can't live without him! I can't! Soldier! A strange unconsciousness. This medicine never fails. May God protect him. His face is drained. - His pulse is weakening. - So do something, physician. Find a medicine to bring him to consciousness. All my medicines have failed, Your Highness. No medicine can bring him back to consciousness. That cannot be true! It is not true! There must surely be a medicine? A cure? I am helpless, Your Majesty. To bring the Prince back to consciousness is beyond my capacity. Are you telling me that Shekhu will never regain consciousness? The medicines have all been tried. The patient now needs prayers. - Raja Man Singh... - Your Majesty? Arrange for charity immediately. Give away all the royal treasure to the poor and the orphans. Release all prisoners, also those sentenced to death. Implore everyone to beg for the life of Prince Salim. Ask the Hindus to pray in temples. Ask Muslims to offer prayers. Ask our subjects to beg for the life of their crown prince! True life is his... who gives himself up to someone else... and loses himself in love Lord, my son is regaining consciousness. That very voice... It's the magic of that very voice! Let her in! Come immediately. The Emperor has sent for you. Anarkali! Lord! Thanks to your voice, the Prince has seen a ray of hope. You have perhaps appeared in answer to our prayers. As an errand of mercy, save my son's life! - Delay it no more! Please! - Please come, Anarkali. Having heard your voice, my son has called me Mother after ages. Maybe you will give my son back to me. I am helpless! Give me back the one I live for, Anarkali. Sing, Anarkali. Please sing. Pray, oh sorrowful heart Pray to God Spread your hands in helplessness and despair Pray, oh sorrowful heart Appeal to God Let lightning not strike these palaces Let it instead strike my humble abode Pray, oh sorrowful heart Pray to God May you live forever. May I lose my life Let at least this be the excuse that gives me death What will I do with a few more breaths? Pray, oh sorrowful heart Pray to God What will I give you? Everything I possessed has been snatched away What have I, save for a few prayers? God is the one support the poor have And yet, I beg You... do not break my heart, now that it has found succor Pray, oh sorrowful heart pray to God Spread your hands in helplessness and despair Pray, oh sorrowful heart Appeal to God - Shekhu... - My son... Long live the Prince! Long Live Prince Salim Long live the Crown Prince! Where is she? Anarkali... Your Majesty? The Prince wishes to see you. - What is the matter? - Please grant me your leave. Stop her, Mother. Please stop her. Please come here, my child. Long live the Prince! Long live Prince Salim! Anarkali, what are you grieving? You were in love. You were always so happy. - My beloved was with me then. - And now? Now... he has become a very big man, Your Majesty. - He has become too powerful. - However powerful he has become... I will bestow upon you royal riches and make you even richer. No, Your Majesty. He has gone too far away from me. I'll have the whole of Hindustan searched... and have him brought to you. In the hope of meeting him, I have lived through these days. But he will never return to me ever again, Your Majesty. May God give your prince a long life. - Please grant me your leave now. - How can I do that? Make an announcement. The prince's recovery will be widely celebrated. Don't be afraid, girl. I am Raja Man Singh. Raja saheb? Although this is against royal protocol... helplessness has driven me to come here. I don't understand. I hope you will understand without having to utter a word. I? I don't understand anything. Really? Or do you refuse to understand anything? Don't talk in riddles, Raja saheb. Tell me clearly whatever you have to say. I admire your audacity, girl. But it could even take your life. The emperor might believe it, even the world may believe it... that you're only a tribal girl who wandered into the Capital. But I won't believe it. I know the secret of your love. What do you know? I know you're an ant that tried to climb a mountain. That despite being a gypsy, you dared to ensnare a prince in your trap. To become the Queen of Hindustan, for all its comforts and luxuries! You've been driven by your lust for wealth! Here is the wealth! Go away from here and sate your lust! You may keep your wealth! It's the rich who lust for wealth. Not poor folks like us. I don't want your wealth, nor do I seek the comforts and luxuries of the palace. All I want is my love. Not from the Prince... I want love from the soldier in whose garb your prince feigned love for me. He betrayed me. He played with my feelings and ruined my life to sate his lust! And today, he lives in the palace! I ask, is it a sin for the poor to fall in love with the rich? In that case, isn't it a sin for the rich to deceive the poor... in order to sate their lust? Does your law have a punishment for this crime? Why are you silent, Raja saheb? You're a law-abiding general! Tell me, can you punish your prince for his crime? I am ashamed of myself, girl. But for your own welfare, I'd still advise you to go away. - Or calamity will strike. - Calamity? What bigger calamity can I face than my beloved betraying me? My beloved has betrayed me! You can, however, rest assured. Why leave after the celebration? Why not leave now? I ask, why leave after the celebration? Why don't you leave right now? The Emperor's orders... Go away! The shackles of love have broken. You are ruined. So what are you waiting for? Waiting? No, I wait for nothing. You can deceive yourself, not me. I see a ray of hope in your eyes. - Yes. Maybe he will return. - No, he's not returning. Your world is plundered. He has forgotten you! He's gotten over you, Nadira. - No! He was in love with me! - Love? A prince falling in love with a nomad? That is a cruel joke! You've been subjected to a cruel joke, Nadira! A prince falling in love with a nomad? You've been subjected to a cruel joke, Nadira! What a joke! Anarkali? She suddenly took ill and couldn't attend, Your Majesty. Her absence at an occasion like this would appear to be ominous. Let the celebrations begin. Wonderful! That was splendid! Anarkali! Khan-saheb, please begin. Awaken the sweet ache of love Let my heart pine... with the high notes of your tears It took one gaze from you... to put the world to sleep This world is deep in slumber The skies are deep in slumber In deep sleep is your love Awaken the sweet ache of love Awaken, awaken To whom shall I tell my story? To whom shall I show my broken heart? Where shall I go? Till far away... there is no light leading me The fires have turned into ashes Let my heart pine... with the high notes of your tears Awaken the sweet ache of love Such were the winds of misery that blew They turned my world upside down All joy has turned away from me Serpents of sorrow continue to bite me Awaken the sweet ache of love Let my heart pine... with the high notes of your tears Splendid, Anarkali! In the eyes of the Almighty and the justice of the Emperor... everyone is an equal. But an evaluation is indeed necessary. I must say, Anarkali has stood out in today's contest. I accord Anarkali the status of the royal courtesan. Long live Anarkali Come here, Anarkali. I am convinced that in keeping with the royal edict... Anarkali's beloved is present here in the royal court. Stand up. Stand up without a fear. If his love is true, I want to see him. Deceit. Betrayal. Lies. How long shall I carry on with my life with the support of such lies? Oh, unfortunate Nadira! You shall find no peace and rest in this world. Only despair. And darkness. - What has happened to you? - Mother, let's go away. How can you say such things? Think about it. Why must we suffer again? We have every comfort here. There is peace and happiness. Mother, you will have to pay for this peace and happiness with my life. Do you want me to live, or die? - No, my child. - So let's go away, Mother. You have no idea what might happen. Have faith in your daughter. I'm not deceiving you. I'm not lying to you. Please listen to me, Mother. Take me away from here. As you wish, my child Before we leave, let's at least meet the womenfolk... - and thank them. - No, Mother. You can go and see them. I'm not going. Parvez! Anarkali is leaving! Anarkali is going away! - I'm losing my life! - Oh really. Your heart is sinking. It's a sign of pining, Prince. - You're thinking of jokes? - It's time for jokes, Prince Love, they say, is an affliction of the mind. Don't poke fun at my love. Give me a solution, if you can. There are so many solutions, Prince. But I'm afraid, my head might roll. - Is that why you call yourself a friend? - I'm not scared of losing my life. If you kill me, you'll be very compassionate about it. But the Emperor will be very merciless when he pronounces my death. - To die a merciless death? Not very appealing. The Emperor? All right, you are helpless before the Emperor, too. And I'm helpless because of his terror. Anarkali is going away, so let her go away. Who will stop her? Salim? That disrespectful Salim? The unfortunate crown prince of Hindustan! How I wish I could fall in love like a common man! I could lay down my life for your tears. Well? What message shall I carry? How will you reach her? How will the message be delivered? I have found him! Just give me the message, Prince. - Who'll deliver it? - Just give it to me! Go to the courtesan's chambers... and give this letter to the most beautiful... the most bewitching women of them all. The one who makes the Moon blush, who is the envy of the stars. Go and give her the Prince's heart. What madness is this? What if the letter falls in someone's hands? Rest assured, Prince. It's my deer. It's no less than its master in recognizing a true beauty. Dearest sweetheart... the one you condemn to death with your departure... seeks from you the right to live. If you want to put my love to a test... light a lamp tonight and wait for me. If I arrive, our love is true. Or else, the dawn following the night is not meant for me. - She's not going away. - Why not? Something is wrong. Go and find out. Go on. I wait... I seek to meet him This lamp burns... and I feel distraught Love is a feeling... that is beyond explanation On the lips, the restlessness of the heart... is never brought out Come to me... my eyes yearn to see you A desire like mine... you must not spurn My heart worships the very ground you tread on The state of lovers... is not to be revealed Love is a feeling... that is beyond explanation Silence! It's me. - What have you come here for? - I've come to you, Anar! To me? To seek your forgiveness for the sins I've committed. What sin have you committed, Prince? For you, it's no sin to play with the feelings of a gypsy girl. You have played with my love. You have toyed with my desires. I must thank you for playing this game with me, Prince. - Hear me out... - Don't touch me, Prince! I've had enough of this game! What else do you want now? God and His angels are witness. I have played no games with you. - Did you really love me? - Yes. Do not insult the sacred word, Prince. Call it your lust! - Anar! - You remember my love today? Where was your love when you played with me for a couple of days... and disappeared? I kept suffering in your memory. I was even sold in the marketplace! I bore every tyranny. I ask, where was your love then? Go away, Prince! The word love does not sound nice when you utter it. But you have taught me to love, Anar. I beg for your forgiveness! What a big joke! The crown prince begs a slave for forgiveness! You're not a slave. You're the Queen of my heart. And I'm no crown prince. I'm your slave. Forgive your slave, Anar. It's lust that makes you flatter me. Do not call my love, lust. Look into my eyes. - Aren't my tears proof of my love? - I've been deceived long enough. You even call my tears a deceit? - How can one trust a prince's tears? - I can give up everything for you! - That's a lie! - How will I convince you? I want to go away... away from this world of deceit and betrayal! My love is nothing but lust, my tears are deceit? My intentions are evil? Very well, then. Leave, if that's your wish. But remember, your picture is etched on my heart. - I won't be able to live without you! - That's what you think, Prince. That is the truth! I can lay down my life to prove that my love is true. Those that threaten, do little, Prince. So you want proof, Anar? You want proof? Soldier! What are you doing? In my death, you would have believed my love to be true. Soldier, my dear soldier. You won't go away now, will you? - How can I ever leave you? - Anar! It's dawn, Anar. I must leave now. - Prince... - I'll come again. Every day, every evening. Light a lamp in the moonlight every evening and wait for me. I will return with all my love. Girl! So what I heard is true. You have to decided to stay on in the palace. Why haven't you left? It was the Emperor's order. Didn't you want to leave, despite the Emperor's orders? I've changed my mind. It looks like you've met with Prince Salim already. If I deny that? You can't deceive me. Raja Man Singh can very well see the truth. How dare you disobey my order? Who is the criminal who supports you? Criminal? And what is his crime, Raja saheb? That he deceived you. He showed you fancy dreams, a pack of lies. If what he said is lies, what is the truth, Raja saheb? The truth is you're a slave. And the crown prince of Hindustan can never wed a slave! - Why not? - It's the custom. In that case, he's not the criminal. You're the criminal, Raja saheb. Silence, insolent girl! Don't cross your limits! I beg your pardon, Raja saheb, but you are the criminal... who weighs love in the scales of wealth. God made us all equals. It was people like you who created the classes... and erected barriers between them. The royal laws are as firm as God's rules. I can give you no help in this respect. I have no hopes of you, Raja saheb. I pin my hopes on him... who's a human being, despite living in a palace of gold. He's the one with the heart, who loves me... - and compels me to requite his love. - He is a fool! He is blind. He's ignorant of the consequences despite knowing everything. In the garb of love, he's playing with your life! My life belongs to him. He can very well play with it. - Why must you worry? - I don't! If you want to live in the palace at the risk of your life, you may. But remember, you will be watched. I'll be told of everything you do. So watch your step. One wrong step, and it'll be your last. Even death at my beloved's feet shall be a celebration of life. A life full of love lasts but a few moments Even if it's too little, it lasts a lifetime Thrones and riches of the world... nothing is bigger than love A life full of love lasts but a few moments Even if it's too little, it lasts a lifetime Anarkali goes to meet someone secretly in the night. It'll be dealt with. He has fled. Whatever you do... you cannot escape my clutches. A life full of love lasts but a few moments Even if it's too little, it lasts a lifetime Where two hearts full of love beat together... it's the most beautiful celebration of love A life full of love lasts but a few moments Anar, your love shall await you in the garden tonight. Salim? The prince and Anarkali? No, this is impossible! I'm ruined! Anarkali has robbed me of everything I had! Don't cry, Gulnar. Yes, if there is courage, there is life. Revenge! Vengeance! Something that will be a testimony of Gulnar's love! - What are you going to do, Gulnar? - She will wait for him tonight. - But I will show her the way. - What? The way to death. I'll lead her to the tunnel... where the prince has his man-eating lion. Anarkali will not get to know. She will receive my letter... and go to the tunnel to meet Salim. There she will confront the lion! Anarkali's bloodstained remains will give succor to my heart. It's very late, Parvez. When you're waiting for someone, time does pass slowly, Prince. She has come, Prince! - You may leave now. - God protect you. I shall stand guard so the Prince's fun isn't ruined. Guess who it is. Tell me. Answer me. I'm not the one you think I am. Why don't you speak? Oh yes, it's right too. There's silence everywhere. Why must we speak either? Come, let's sit quietly somewhere. Prince... Anar! Who are you? Gulnar! Yes, it isn't Anar. It's the unfortunate Gulnar! Let me go! Do not separate me from yourself! Even if it was by deceit... your embrace was wonderful! It's so soothing, so peaceful. You dare! If I'm a slave who dares do this, she, too, is. Silence, shameless woman! How can you ever equal Anarkali's sacred love? - You aren't even the dust on her feet! - Why? Because her love is successful? And mine has failed? Prince... - Leave me alone! - Prince! - Stay away! - Prince! Do not humiliate me, Prince. Do not humiliate me like this! There's no telling what a scorned woman might do. - She might do anything! - You're threatening me? No, Prince. No. I'm begging you... for love. For one moment of love. For one moment of love, give yourself unto me. - This moment belongs to me! To me! - Insolent woman! Get out of my sight! You have seen Gulnar's love. You will now see her revenge. With all my love, I lay myself at your feet. But you have spurned me. You have humiliated me! I'm not the one you kicked. You kicked your own destiny! - What can you do to me? - I can expose your secret... - to the whole empire! - What secret? - What proof do you have? - A very big proof, too. There were birds flying in the skies. Your pigeons and my falcons. I have in my possession your letters. And those letters can change destiny. It can restore to me my lost pride... and it can make you a slave to me! But I don't even want you as my slave. I hate you, Prince! I hate you! Hatred seeks revenge and this revenge shall come from Anarkali! You know, it's enough for the letters to reach the Emperor. Anarkali will then be thrust into the dungeons. She'll be subjected to tyranny. She'll be sentenced to death. And I'll stand by and laugh. You'll come to me in tears. You'll fall at my feet. You'll say, Gulnar, take away everything from me... but please save Anarkali's life. And I will kick you, as you kicked me. And I will say, I want death. Only death! Anarkali's death! She has snatched everything from me! My status, my position... my love and my life! Anarkali's death will mean life to me! You want to kill me? No! You can't kill me! It's Emperor Akbar's rule! He's the one who'll pass justice! Don't come any closer! I'll scream! It'll bring the guards here... and you'll be shamed! You will be shamed! Come no further! Before you succeed in your evil designs... I will finish you! No, a death like this one is too easy for a sinner like you. I'll throw you to my lions! They'll calm your fire of revenge with your blood! They'll maul you! They'll wipe out every trace of you! Prince! - Get out of here! - What are you doing, Prince? I'll protect your life by giving her death! If her death gives me life, I don't want to live at all! - What are you saying. Anar? - It's the truth. I wish you knew, my love means the life to me. And that has nothing to do with death. While I live, your enemies cannot be left alive! Beware! If you take another step... it'll be as good as strangling my love. Let her go. I have a request to make of you. If possible, please turn this hatred into love. Forgive me, sister! Forgive me for my sin! Don't say that. You don't know. I'm so ashamed of myself! Lord, if there's anything in my heart other than love for Anarkali... may I burn in the fires of hell! May I not find peace even in my grave! Let's go, Anar. Where's the letter? I swear, it's not with me. All right. It's not with me! So why're you running away? Will you give it to me or must I find it myself? I'm getting it for you! Anar, you don't know what a dangerous woman Gulnar is. - She's a venomous snake. - God protects those in love. - I've made up my mind, Anar. - What? It's time now for the Emperor to get to know about my love. - Really? And how? - The Emperor's birthday approaches. On that day, he forgets the worries of the world... and gives himself up to joy and merriment. Where the Empire goes to sleep, love is awakened. - Will you then? - No. At the celebrations in the Glass Palace... an Anarkali, high on love, will dance and to regale the gathering. Everything in the world will be swaying and dancing. All the courtiers and distinguished elders... even the Emperor himself will come alive to the revelry. At a time like that, I will ask him for your hand. - And he won't be able to refuse you? - No, never! The Glass Palace will bring for us the message of a new life. The Glass Palace will bring for you not the message of life... but the message of death. You're kicking up a storm today. Wait till she gets ready. Then you'll see. The charm, the airs... whom is the lightning going to strike? If I have permission, may I dress her up? She's ready already. See if there's something missing. No one survives this intoxication. Go on. Once the drug takes effect, her feet will falter... her eyes will glaze over and the secret of her love will be out. Where has my destiny... brought me today? Glass everywhere... makes a mockery of me Anarkali, get a hold on yourself. Do not blame me... for passing out It would be an insult... to my helpless love In my love, my feet stagger... and the world thinks I have arrived drunk One who sheds tears all day and night... is ordered to make people laugh The world thinks I have arrived drunk Helplessly in love with someone... I have walked to him, but he does not come to me The world thinks I have arrived drunk The one for whom I have ruined my life... sits there, with the heart he has stolen from me The world thinks I have arrived drunk For how long shall you hide? Look at me in the eye Meet my gaze But you wouldn't even care if I lost my life The world thinks I have walked in, drunk In my love, my feet stagger... and the world thinks I have arrived drunk Anarkali! It's only about love. Take her into custody! Take away everything from me! The throne of Hindustani... the luxuries of the palace and the riches! I want nothing! I want only Anarkali! I will think you have given me everything! - What if your father does not agree? - You can tell him then... that he won't find me alive. He'll find my corpse tomorrow. He can then take out a procession of my funeral and have his way! You want me to give Anarkali to Salim? And make a courtesan the Queen of Hindustan? You know what a queen is? She's a goddess of virtue and sacrifice. She's a mother to her subjects, Like you are, Queen. Not a tramp, a woman who is nothing but a plaything! I wholeheartedly agree with what you say. But if you had any idea of what I am going through. What's the matter? Tell me. I'll rescue you. Then we'll not be so helpless and distraught. Love shall be free again. And there will be only you and me. That's what you always say. You're a prince, after all. - That's your compulsion. - Compulsion? Because I'm a prince? The only son of Jalaluddin Akbar. The only heir to the Moghul throne! The heir to Hindustan's throne! Is that is why you've been tied in chains, Anar? I swear it on you! I will bring about a bloodbath! This regime will exist no more. The Moghuls will cease to be! - There will be no Akbar, no Salim... - Come to your senses, Prince! What are you talking about? Those in love don't talk about bloodshed. Don't say such things, Anar. It's precisely this attitude that has weakened my resolve. Whether the regime exists or not, whether the empire exists or not... whether Salim becomes the emperor or not... you and I will live and die together. That is what I have decided. - This is a rebellion! - No. It's the call of love! - Your Majesty... - You dare! The Prince has declared a rebellion against you. He's leading troops to attack the royal palace. Salim has rebelled? Man Singh! - Hear that, Queen? - Salim is still a child. He doesn't know many youngsters of his age. I'll go and placate him. What have you done, Shekhu? A son brings pride to his mother before his father. And you make me bow my head in shame forever. Defeat! Defeat for Akbar! Defeat for the Moghul empire! From whom? From a trampish slave! For the sake of a slave, he wants to fight against his parents. He wants to wipe out the Moghul empire. - At your service, Sire. - Man Singh... take royal troops to combat Salim. Bring him here, dead or alive. No, brother! You are Salim's uncle! Do not kill my son! - It's the order of the Emperor, sister. - Don't be so cruel, Emperor! How will Salim ever fight the royal forces? - I will brook no rebellion. - It isn't anyone else... who's rebelling. It's our own flesh and blood, Salim! Even if he brings his troops, captures us and kills us... he'll still remain our son. We are his parents. We'll lay down our lives for his happiness. Is that a Rajput woman speaking? A lioness? The Queen of Hindustan? Yes. Because I'm a mother first. Everything else comes afterwards. A mother can give away all she has for the sake of her son's life. I don't want the regime. I don't want these luxuries! All I want is my son! Only my son! You had once yourself told me... that the scales of our justice must never waver, even for our son. Do you want history to say that when the occasion arose... Akbar's life was blotted with the love of his son? You say that because you are only an Emperor. Not a father! Give it a thought. Did we seek favors at temples and mosques? Did we invoke the Gods for a son... so that our own forces would one day turn his enemies? Think of those days when Salim used to fall ill... and we spent days and nights sitting at his bedside. We used to pray for his life. Was it so that our royal forces will claim his life today? Very well, Queen. I will personally go to battle with Salim. All alone, at that. No, Emperor, you cannot go! Salim is a rebel. His blood is boiling. He might raise his hand at you! No, I'm not letting you go! What do you want me to do, Queen? Your decisions are all very strange, Emperor. You want to gift me my son and snatch my husband's life from me. But a Hindu woman has forever sacrificed her son for her husband. Man Singh, the Queen of Hindustan orders you. Take the royal forces to combat the rebellion started by Salim. Bring that worthless boy here, dead or alive. The Emperor of Hindustan wishes to go to battle himself, Queen. If Salim, with Moghul blood in his veins, can get down to a rebellion... he is also the son of a Rajput woman. His eyes will certainly show respect and honor for his father. What father and what son in a battle, Emperor? Whose life will I pray for? Your husband has a request to make of you, Queen. You must pray for Salim's life. It's okay if I die. But if something happens to Salim... the Moghul empire's heir will be wiped out! - To Salim, the Emperor of Hindustan. - Glory be! To the Moghul empire, glory be! Amen. My dear man, you have taken the most important step of your youth today. I want to congratulate you. One who comes alone either comes with a message of peace... or wishes to prove his supremacy. No, Emperor Akbar has come to test the daring of a rebel. You can test my daring only in the battlefield. Salim, to fight the Moghul forces is not an easy task. As a father, I do not want my son to face defeat in the battle. I want to see you succeed, Salim. But Salim will not capture a lone man... and insult his bravery! Insult for a rebel? A successful rebel is not a rebel! True, but success you will have... only when you apply your father's blood on your forehead. Shekhu, your mother wishes to light lamps for your success. Go and light those lamps. Give her the news of your success. Pick up your spear, Shekhu! A father's chest eagerly awaits his son's spear to pierce it! This is the chest on which you once rested your head, Shekhu. Oh soldiers of Emperor Akbar, you have been misled. Your chief is helpless. To Jalaluddin Akbar, the Emperor of Hindustan... Glory be! Present the offenders in court. My child! The accused Nadira, alias Anarkali... is accused of treason, ensnarement and rebellion. The accused Salim. Crown Prince... - son of Jalaluddin Akbar... - Hold it. I have no parents. It is my misfortune that I have no parents. If I had any parents, they would have been here with me. Like that mother there. Sorrowful, grieving... at her daughter's plight, almost going mad. If she could, she would bite open the shackles at her daughter's feet. Else, she'd bang her head on the ground and give up her life. My son! Please enter it in the records. The accused Salim has no father. I'm a rebel! I know a rebel gets a death sentence! So give me a death sentence! No! The confession to a crime is not evidence of the crime. My Lord, what would the accused have gained from a rebellion? Riches, throne? What was it that he did not have... or that he did not have a right to? So why would he rebel? - For the sake of love. - Exactly. For the accused, the rebellion was an act of emotions. He did take up arms, but out of innocence. His rebellion is nothing more than an act of rebellion against a father. Parents do always forgive their children's trespasses, Lord. The accused is indeed at fault, but he's not guilty. I beg the royal court for a pardon to the accused Salim, Lord. What do the other courtiers have to say? Lord, the accused Salim should be released. - He may be forgiven. - He may be spared, Lord. Issue the orders, Lord! Issue the order for his release, Lord. To acquaint the court with the truth, I will now tell you... something that goes against the grain of the Rajputs. But it's a question of Hindustan's future. May God forgive me. It's Anarkali who instigated Salim into a rebellion! That's a lie! A fabrication! Silence. You may carry on. She's the one who committed the crime, who wouldn't relent despite warnings. But she thought a rebellion was a better option. She had strung dreams around the rebellion... and she encouraged Salim to rebel, so that her dreams would be fulfilled. - Anarkali is the offender, not Salim! - Justice, Emperor! I want justice! Everyone saves his own kin. But to be compassionate with others is the hallmark of a emperor. You know what your son has done. But it is my blood that runs in my daughter's veins. I swear it on that blood! She is not guilty! She's the one to whom you gave riches, but she rejected them. If she wished, she could even have asked you for your throne. And you couldn't have refused her. But she wouldn't even take love as charity. If she is guilty, I ask the world... who is innocent? What is law? Where is justice? Before you declare my daughter a criminal, you must... Mother! Before you snatch my daughter from me, you must snatch a son from his mother! No, Mother! Don't say that! No one is the criminal. Not the prince, not I. But if love is a crime, we are indeed criminals. But I ask you, Emperor... why do you hold me guilty of this crime? It's because you don't like the idea of my love. The love of a slave with a prince. The love of the poor with the rich. But I ask you again, Emperor, are the poor not human? Was it God who made differences between the rich and the poor? Do not grief and sorrow affect the rich and the poor alike? Is the blood of the rich, blood? And ours, water? So why these differences between the rich and the poor? Why do we face these consequences when we fall in love? If there is a law that declares such a love to be a crime... it stands on a foundation of injustice. It is the duty of human beings to fight against it. Girl! You will be punished with death for offending the law. I will say it again, at the top of my voice! Ours was not a rebellion! It was the call of love! It was a struggle for justice! It was a war against tyranny! Oh Lord of Justice... before you pass sentence, do remember... that this is not the final court. There is a court far greater than this court. The Court of God. There, you shall be asked to account for your justice. Lord Almighty, grant unto me strength and wisdom. I find myself to be a weak father. It is proved that the accused Salim and Anarkali... showed no faith in royal justice, took the law into their hands... and staged a rebellion against the regime. The accused Salim and Nadira are guilty of treason, disobedience... contempt of court and insult to the Emperor Akbar. Both are sentenced to death. Lord, the courtiers seek an audience with you. Queen, stay with me. The courtiers have assembled here to request Your Majesty... to reconsider your decision. Should it be considered then that the Emperor did not issue the decision... after due consideration? We come only with a petition of mercy, oh Queen. But rebels have always been given a death sentence. There is a difference between the prince and other rebels, Your Majesty. - Why? - He's dear not only to you... he's dear to all of us. He's the heir to the throne of Hindustan. In the eyes of the law, however, he is a criminal. There is no law for kings and emperors, Lord. Is that what the courtiers of Akbar say? Nobody is above the law. Not you, not I, not my son. Undoubtedly. But the laws have to be compromised at times... - to save the situation. - What does that mean? The Prince is the only heir of the Moghul empire. If he does not live, the lineage will cease to exist! - This empire will cease to exist. - It isn't families that run empires. It's principles that run it. To save my family... I cannot ignore the law. I cannot betray my conscience and compromise my integrity. God has given me the power to sit in justice. Will I be able to face God on the Day of Reckoning? My forefathers' souls will heap ridicule on me. They will say that I killed justice for the sake of my son's life. - But... - I don't want to listen to anything! Even if the name of Moghul is wiped out... it's impossible for me to spare Salim's life. That is not possible! As much right as you have to Salim, we Rajputs have a right, too. Salim is a symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity. The Rajputs gave their daughter to marry you... because the son of the Rajputs and the Moghuls would be the ruler of Hindustan. And the Rajputs had put their swords back in their sheaths. You want to wipe out that fact from history. But we Rajputs won't let you do that. The Rajputs might very well draw their swords again to save him... Raja Man Singh! Do not cross your limits. Emperor, Queen, we have erred only out of emotions. Don't get carried away by your emotions. Look at the Emperor's state. At daybreak tomorrow, his only son will be delivered to death. You may leave now. Prince, give me death! I'm the reason for your ruin! I was the one that exposed your secret! I am the one who's responsible for your impending death! Kill me! Please! Deliver me from this life! No! A few moments after our death, Anar and I will be united again. We shall be rid of the world. Forever and forever. Away from the eyes of a filthy woman like you! I don't want to kill you. Else, your soul will follow us even there! Go away, Gulnar. You shall live on. - All alone. - No, Prince! No! I'm in love with you, too. I can't live without you! Exactly! You will live and burn in the fires of hell! - No, Prince. - Soldiers! - Don't separate me from you! - Take her away! I'll go mad, Prince! I'll go mad without you! I'll go insane! Life is rendered helpless All we have is despair Are we the only ones who suffer this fate? Or is God above watching us? Oh Lord, what has life brought us to? Why is life a story of sorrow and helplessness? Even as You watch... the world continues to punish us ls love a crime? Do please tell me Why is our happiness plundered even as we reach our goal? Oh Lord, what has life brought us to? Why is life a story of sorrow and helplessness? I have just this request to make of You... Allah, do keep alive in the world the name of lovers Or else, death is the only consequence for those in love Anar... Prince... It's time for us to travel together. I'm fortunate... that you spared the time for me. A slave isn't worth the price you're paying for me. This is too little, Anar. I'm ashamed... I have nothing more precious than life to give away for you. Soldier! I have been so unlucky for you. Don't say that. Unless love is painted in the hues of blood... it's not worthwhile. - You ought to be happy. - Yes. On the one hand, I'm happy to have your heart. On the other... I can't be happy to take your life. Don't grieve, Anar. Lovers are often star-crossed. It's a matter of pride that I walk with you. You must congratulate me for my loyalty. That's what I'm thankful for. But how I wish you were unfaithful. Are you afraid of the journey ahead? Of death? Not at all. That you are with me... your memories, your thoughts, are all with me. Go away now. Someone might overhear us. May God protect you. May God protect you. To those who are to die... may God be the protector. Has the Queen been widowed even as Emperor Akbar lives? No, Emperor. My husband still lives. - So what makes you wear that attire? - It's my son's wedding. Present the offenders. The mother may bid her son farewell. I give her permission. Shekhu! My son! Look at the mother who comes to bid farewell to her son. But where are you going anyway, my son? From one mother's lap to another. Mother, my son has been brought up with a lot of love and care. Take good care of him. My son, remember your mother's helplessness. It'll make your journey easier. To the lord of riches, and everyone present here... I extend my congratulations on this happy occasion. The Prince, whom everyone in this great land... wished to see some day on the throne of the mighty Moghuls... to keep the justice of the Emperor alive, is being sacrificed today. Perhaps there are some who doubt the Emperor's sense of justice. They are mistaken. Because the Emperor never makes a mistake. Man Singh, this is no time for sermons. Obey my command. Obey! Obey! Obey! What do I see, Man Singh? Silence? A silent rebellion? But that won't happen! Akbar's orders shall not be disregarded! Shahbaz Khan! Jashn Singh! Obey my orders! Man Singh, I entrust this task to you. Emperor, we Rajputs wield the swords only on the battlefields. Please spare us the torture of those that behead. Man Singh! I will blow this conspiracy to smithereens! I will trample this dangerous uprising under my feet! Emperor Akbar shall not see the walls of the mighty Moghuls... crumble, while he lives! My faith shall not crumble before my eyes! Raja Man Singh, I will today write a new chapter in Hindustan's history. I will myself take this sentence of justice to its logical conclusion. Allah, Your humble servant... strives to uphold Your laws on earth. If my voice be Your voice, if my verdict be Your decision... grant strength to my hands and courage to my heart. Amen. Emperor, your prayer has the same effect... that Hazrat lbrahim's prayer had, when he sacrificed his son. History is witness to how the son accepted death with a smile. And history shall bear testimony to the fact... that a son today yearns to fulfill his father's sense of justice. Step forward, Emperor. If it is my face that prevents you... if it is the blood of your son that weakens you... blindfold your eyes and mine. It will make the sacrifice easier. Allah! The pride of Emperor Akbar is reflected in a criminal's eyes. That I face defeat in my endeavor is proof of my wrong decision. My weak admission loses to your resolve. I set you free. Release the poor Anarkali, too. Where is Anarkali? Where have they taken her? - Why don't you speak? - I don't know, sire. Orders were to take her to an isolated place... - to be buried alive. - Allah! Go immediately and look everywhere! Set her free, wherever she is. Those are the royal orders! True life is his... who gives himself up to someone else... and loses himself in love Hearts that could not meet in this world... shall meet in God's world Love shall blossom... in God's paradise Even if life is lost in love, it matters not True life is his... who gives himself up to someone else... and loses himself in love My story shall make them weep So will the lamp that is lit on my tomb Even in the wilderness shall this bud blossom Do not call this a tomb It's a palace of love True life is his... who gives himself up to someone else... and loses himself in love Twilight, I welcome I embrace this evening of my life In you, I shall immerse myself I shall forget the world If only I could see him once I'd say good-bye Good-bye, good-bye Adieu Farewell This grave is a symbol of love Of the poignant saga of love Of the wait for the bee... lies here Anarkali
