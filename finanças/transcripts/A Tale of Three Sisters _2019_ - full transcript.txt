It’s God’s will. May God have mercy on his soul. – Amen. A TALE OF THREE SISTERS My cutie. Cutie pie. Cutie pie. My son. My baby smells so sweet. My dear! Oh God! Forgive me, my God! Forgive me, my God! Oh God, forgive me! Peace be upon you. And... upon you. How many sheep are in your flock? What's it to you? First give the man a proper greeting. Peace be upon you. – And upon you. How many sheep are there? – Why? Just tell us. Fifty. Why do you ask? We're sheep traders. Who owns them? I've never seen you around here. Where are you from? We're from higher up the mountain. What are you doing here at this hour? We got lost. We were going to Taspinar. But we took a wrong turn, and got lost. Are you alone? – No, I have my dog. "Blondie", a vicious sheepdog. Blondie! Blondie, come! Come here. Be careful! It might attack. It's really vicious. Well, who is the owner? Why do you keep asking? Alright then. With your permission, we need to hit the road. I heard you're taking Gokhan to the hospital. The poor thing had diarrhea for days. He doesn't look sick. He's laughing, playing. So now you know better than me? I'm the one changing his diapers. They've been runny for days. Last month I almost died from pneumonia, but you didn't lift a finger. Are you comparing yourself to a tiny baby? Look what I brought! Girl, what is all this? Metin's old clothes. How beautiful they are. Just look at these pyjamas! Oh, what a beautiful shirt! Havva! Who gave these to you? My mother. – Don't call her mother! What's it to you? She can call her whatever she wants. Did Meral really give them to you? Yes, she did. I'll ask her when I go to the town. Go ahead. So what? She just gave her Metin's old clothes. They are really beautiful! I'm not going out to the herd anymore. What's this all of a sudden? I'm not going! Okay, but why? Bandits came near the herd yesterday. Bandits? What are you talking about? Sure, go ahead and laugh. If I didn't have my rifle, me and the herd would both be history. This guy's father was a coward, too. He was afraid of the dark. He signed up to work at the mine when it opened. But he was too afraid to go down. He said he'd rather die. But he still went down, trembling, every single time. Don't tell the same story over and over! His dad said, "There were black-faced jinns down in the mine. These jinns were bashing the beams with stones." He was always saying, "The mine will collapse, I won't go down." Didn't they slit a shepherd's throat and steal his flock last year? Boy, you're same as your father. You're a coward just like him. Don't slam the door. Father, don't bother with that half-wit. She's a good-natured one. Don't give up easily. We'll try again. Father, you're talking to yourself again. I'm not talking to myself, I'm talking to you. Havva is like me. She's the good-natured one. She's also not stupid like you. Father, not this again. – Sure! You didn't like it? After so many years, you've come back home. If only your late mother was here. Then she'd see all the things I did for you. If Mother was still here, she would have never let us go. What else could she have done? They gave all her sisters away as household helps. But they never returned to the village. Your mother used to tell me, "I got stuck in this village and ended up marrying you." She envied her sisters so much. She would always say, "I'll give my daughters away as household helps, so they'll marry to the city folk." I never heard this from my mom. What? You're so ungrateful. Do you think I'm lying? I swear you're ingrates. All you do is feel sorry for yourselves. You'll say "Our father gave us away when Mother died." Won't you? But the day you went to the city you forgot your home. Don't forget how miserable you were when they sent you back to the village. Did I want to come back? What could you do? You didn't let me go to my aunt in Ankara. Your stupid talk is making me angry. I will still go to Ankara to my aunt. Once my Gokhan is a bit older. I'll go to Ankara. Sure, my daughter, you can go. But don't forget your husband here. Otherwise he'll cry after you. Of course I'll go. I will get my son an education. He'll be a doctor, God willing. Havva, come closer. Isn't he sweet? Oh yes, God bless him! Oh, there's a scorpion! – Where? It came out from under the cradle. Girl, are you talking about this tiny little thing? So now you're afraid of these little things? This little thing? – Father, take it away. It's come back to life! I swear! Dad, come on! Dad, it's really moving! – What! You rascals, you! You shouldn't joke around with scorpions. Even a dead scorpion can sting. Is something wrong? So you sleep here? Where else would I sleep? Are we going to sleep in the living room? Where else? Isn't this inappropriate? What's inappropriate? We're married! Are we supposed to lie next to Havva? Let us sleep here, you sleep there with your daughter. Come on, beat it. If you want privacy, go build your own house. Don't! Havva is going to wake up. She won't. Leave me alone! I won't. I said leave me alone! – Sister? It's nothing, sweetheart. You damn... Sister, for God's sake, haven't you seen these sheets? They're completely black. So what? It hasn't even been two months since I washed them. Two months? So that's why they are black. Your highness does not approve? You try hand washing, and we'll see how far you get. What's this, girl? I'm washing the sheets, they're so black. This is not a fancy mansion. They've just been washed. Is firewood free? Put that out, quick. The village chief just told me Mr. Necati is coming tomorrow. Welcome, Mr. Necati. – Thank you. We can't keep going on like this, Sevket. It's the same story over and over. She will get her punishment, don't worry. She is just that way. I don't know who she got it from. I will straighten her out, don't worry. I doubt it will help. She did it before, you know. We wanted to give her another chance, but... Neriman swore not to take her back. I don't know what to say, Mr. Necati. Maybe you'll reconsider? No, not this time. I thought I'd stay for the evening. Good thinking, Mr. Necati. I didn't open my practice today. I also need to talk to the chief about our cypress trees here. Where is the chief, anyway? In the coffeehouse. Shall I call him over? I asked him for a raki table tonight. We can set it up right away. How is it going? – What can I say? It's the same old, same old. I hope you're doing well? I've missed you sweetheart. I've really missed both of you. I could only speak with Havva on the phone. You didn't even come to the funeral. Neriman didn't let me go. Oh, my cutie, look at him. God bless him. How chubby he is! What happened girl? Why are you coughing? I must have caught a cold. Well, don't let the baby catch it. Well, what now? What did you do? Did you beat Ozgur again? No, I just pushed him a little. But that mama's boy told his mama right away. When will you wisen up? I just hit him slightly, they don't know what a real beating is. How could you beat that child? Oh, Ozgur, my dear. I miss him so much. He's like an angel. Sure, a real angel... Pissy angel! Good grief! It's like an illness. He doesn't wet his bed on purpose. If so, have them check it out. Isn't his dad a doctor? He should treat him. Oh God... How heartless you have become! Really! You all make excuses for that pissy kid. Every morning I washed those pee-stained sheets. I got sick washing those sheets. Don't pretend to cough. Pretend? Don't you see my condition? You should've taken good care of yourself. So it's my fault again? What a precious child he is. First his parents, then you. You all spoiled him. Don't talk stupid. You really enjoyed wiping Ozgur's butt, it's obvious. Don't make me get up. Stop fighting. You just met. That child needs discipline. – Bravo! You really disciplined him. Now you stay here. We can marry you off to lame Hamdi any day you want. You marry lame Hamdi, divorce Veysel. Hamdi is just as handsome. You'll get the log! Or better: go back to Mr. Necati. Since you miss your Ozgur, and his pee and poo. I told you to shut up! But I don't know if they'd take back the girl they kicked out with a bastard in her belly! You whore! I'll bash your filthy mouth! Don't do this on the first day. What a damn witch! What's going on here? You're fighting as soon as you meet again? Bravo. Well done all of you. Havva, come find me later. I'll have you make some salad. Reyhan, you two make some ayran. What? At this hour? Mr. Necati will take it with him. His wife ordered some fresh ayran. Do something useful instead of fighting. Chief. What are we going to do about those cypress trees? Well, I think we should wait another year. What? – Waiting one more year would be good. It seems our partners don't take care of them. Why do you say that? They aren't tall enough. But cypresses don't grow any taller than that. That's right. They only grow that much. Is that so? – Yes. Well, fine then. Here's to you. – Dig in. No hard feelings, right, Mr. Necati? What for? Because of Nurhan. I'm embarrassed because of my daughters. Never mind now. You should have slapped her. Didn't you? Would I do such a thing? Whatever, it didn't work out. What can I say? I've given up on Nurhan. She will not change even if you slap her. But you know our Havva, right? Sure. You also know about Mr. Turan's son, what a loss. God, let no one feel the loss of a child. Amen. Well, you know, after that they sent Havva back. Of all my daughters she is very different. She's good-natured, hard-working, knows how to clean. Mrs. Meral said she is very smart. Now, I know it will be hard for you... Maybe we can send Havva to you. I don't know what to say. You know what's best. Havva is really special. Isn't she, chief? Exactly, she is very special. I just don't know. We just got over the last incident. I'd have to ask Neriman. Let's see. What's he doing here? Oh great. Did he leave the flock to Hamdi? Peace be upon you. And also upon you. Welcome, Mr. Necati. Something wrong? You probably don't remember me. Veysel... Reyhan's husband. Oh yeah, Veysel. How are you? Good, thank God. And you? How is Reyhan? Good, thank God. We pray for your health. Have a seat. You didn't go to the herd? Hamdi is with the herd. How about some raki? He doesn't drink Mr. Necati. Sure I do. You can't handle raki, son. One glass won't hurt. Let the young man drink. Just a little, chief. Cheers. Haven't you stopped that habit? What is it? They said you had stopped. Did you start again? What do you mean? Come and help me. Father wants us to make ayran. I'm sorry, sister. About what? What I said. You just can't control your temper. You're right. I got myself fired, I failed. But I will not stay here for long. Oh, Nurhan! It will be harder for you this time. You can win over Mr. Necati. But Neriman... I know. Neriman was against you from the beginning. Because you're my sister. – Really? That's what they said. If so, then she shouldn't have taken me. God forbid! That whole family would die of starvation. You're right. As if she is the master of cooking, she comes and steps in and ruins my beautiful dish. Oh God, how incompetent she is. Was she the one who cut your hair too? Don't even ask. She cut my hair like shearing a sheep. After she left, I took the scissors and messed it up even more. And turned it into Crazy Hatice's hairdo. Then I told everyone, my mother cut it, isn't it nice? You're quite a handful yourself. You did the right thing. Don't listen to what other people are saying. Of course, chief. We're not made for politics. Politicians, they're just bare-faced liars. What can an honest man like you do with politics? Here's to you. Havva, cut the tomatoes really small. Exactly, just like you do at home. Good girl! A real special girl. Mr. Necati. – Yeah? May I ask you something? Well, you're an educated man. You would know. I was wondering, if you pee on a grave by mistake, is that a sin? Boy, did you pee on a grave? Why would you pee on a grave? But it was at night! – Oh lordy! How would Mr. Necati know that? Go ask the imam. Hey, slow down! Easy does it. Eat some meze, or you'll get drunk. Let him drink. You know what, chief? The air here makes me drink. I could handle a big raki myself, with no meze. I'd just get up and go. That's right. Mustafa of the Kurular was here the other day. We finished a big bottle of raki with a watermelon. Does that bastard Mustafa come here? What's wrong with him? During the last recession, that bastard spread rumors about how we were hoarding oil at the gas station. Now every time he sees me, he goes a different way. Mr. Necati. He can't look me in the eye, of course. Mr. Necati. That son-of-a-bitch... What? You were just talking about the gas station... Do you need someone to work there? No, Veysel. Actually, not the gas station. I wanted to ask if you have any jobs in your practice. Who are you asking about work for? For yourself? But do you, Mr. Necati? No, we have a secretary, that's enough. You can't even read. How will you work there? I don't know, as a gopher, or something. Right? Son, we don't have any work like that. You know how the village is. There's nothing left here. We only had the mine, but that's collapsed. There are no men left in the village. The ones who stayed just scrape the old mine for coal to heat in winter. If there's any work in town... If you leave, who is going to tend the flock? What do I care? Find someone else. How much longer will I tend the flock? I'm sick of it! Isn't it funny? You envy the people in town. And I envy you. – Oh please! Definitely. If I could, I'd tell you to give the flock to me. I'd spend a week in the mountains. No one else in sight, the fresh air... But... Our job looks easy from the outside. But it's not. Right, I'm sure your job is hard. There must be some job at the gas station, right? I'd clean the toilets or anything... You know, my brother runs it. We have to ask him. So let's ask him then. Enough! Don't bother him anymore. He said he’d look. If I was on my own, then no problem. But I have Reyhan, I have Gokhan. Is Gokhan supposed to become a shepherd, like me? That's what I'm worried about. Let me raise Gokhan in the town, have him go to school. OK, we'll see. You'll see what? I mean, nothing comes to my mind now, but I’ll ask around. If we move to town, it'll be good for you, too. How so? Reyhan can come to help you every now and then. Since you brought Nurhan back, Reyhan can look after your kids while I’m at the gas station. Don’t stick your nose into business you wouldn't understand. So you think you understand? I'm talking to Mr. Necati anyway. None of your business! Veysel! Don't talk to your father-in-law like that. Well, but Mr. Necati, how can he say that? Is it wrong, what I said? They say the children like Reyhan a lot. She would look after them during the day. But if you say you won't accept Reyhan into your house any longer, then that's a whole other story. Just say so. Fine, Veysel. There's no work I know, but I'll ask my brother. May God bless you. People always said you were such a good man. When will you talk to him? How do I know? When I go there I guess. No offence Mr. Necati, but you city folk, you promise and then you don't keep it. How can you speak like that? – Veysel! I was going to go to town on Sunday. I reckon you could ask by then. What if I stop by your place then? How the hell can I know if there's a job by Sunday, Friday, whenever? Good grief! We're here to enjoy raki, but you keep nagging us. Veysel, come on, you're talking too much. Sorry if I said something wrong. And you know what? You think moving to town is so easy. That everyone is just there waiting for you. But you don’t have a profession, you don’t have any experience. You don’t have any savings. You can't even read or write. You just think, birds will fly into your mouth ready roasted. No, Mr. Necati. I'll borrow some money from Sevket. Borrow what? Do I look like I have money? I don’t want it for myself. I want it for your daughter and your grandson. Are you going to take your money to your grave? What money, you maniac? Everybody knows how stingy you are. Didn’t I tell you to speak properly to your father-in-law? With all due respect, but you always take his side. Why are you always ganging up on me? I have had it! Enough! Stop with it! That's enough! Time to get up! Didn't I say he can't drink? Go walk around for a bit. On your way now! But we're just having a normal talk. Come on! Don't make me pissed off. Why are you pushing me, chief? Don't push. You came here to our table uninvited anyway. Don't ruin it more! Chief, that's enough. Son, go and get some fresh air. I will make myself understood. Beat it! Scram! Chief! I said stop fucking pushing me! Watch your mouth! Move it! Fuck off! What's your problem, motherfucker? What is it? Am I speaking out of turn? You son-of-a-bitch! Fucker! Good lord! What the hell did I do wrong? Did I do something wrong at that fucking table? The other day I saw your guy at the market. My guy? The pharmacist's apprentice, who else? He is back in town, walking around shamelessly. Why should I care? It's all Mr. Necati's fault. He should've behaved like a father, and made that bastard marry you. How could he? The bastard ran off. How far could he go? It's a small town. And everyone knows him. If they wanted, couldn't they've found him? And look, now he's back. But, I can't understand how you did such a thing, and got fooled by him. Who said I got fooled? What do you mean? He didn't promise anything. – How so? He just didn't. Have you gone mad? Don't let anyone hear this. Everyone thinks he fooled you by promising marriage. So what was it then? Nothing. If he didn't promise, then why? You just did it for fun? You can't be serious! Dear God, forgive our sins! Didn't you think about the end of it? I didn't think about it. Was it better to come back and marry that moron Veysel? How could I have known I would end up with Veysel? I figured out I was pregnant when I came to the village. If you didn't look pregnant, why were you kicked out? Neriman caught us once. How did she catch you? It's none of your business. Don't be so nosy. When they found a baby on their doorstep, they were so surprised. I thought, maybe they'd take my Gokhan and look after him. But, why did you go back there again? If you hadn't, maybe they wouldn't have figured it out. I don't know. That bastard Riza is quite handsome, by the way. Do you miss him sometimes? Well, since you did it for fun, was it good at least? Why do you ask? Will you do it, too? – No, never. Why? – I'm afraid. What are you afraid of? I'm just afraid. Don't tell me you're afraid of a little penis! Stop it! – Don't be afraid, it's just a tiny bit of flesh. Ugh! Such language. I can show you Gokhan's, so you get used to it. Sister, just shut up! You know one night, I made Ozgur get up to pee. And? I took the pot, pulled down his underpants. Ugh! Right under my nose, as big as my arm. Oh come on! I swear! I almost dropped the pot. How big can it be at his age? You should've seen it erect. After that night, I didn't wake him up again. Oh, so that's why he wets his bed every night. Let him. I won't wake him up to pee again. It was in my nightmares. It's nothing to be afraid of. It was as big as my arm! Don't worry, it has no bone. So you say it doesn't hurt? Of course it hurts a bit, but only at the beginning. And then? Then it's good. Very good? Good grief! If it weren't good, would so many people do it? I wouldn't. Fine, don't then. Lock it away where you can't see. It's ready. Our kettle is in Hacer's house. I'll go get it. Veysel. Veysel! Reyhan? Reyhan. My Reyhan! My Reyhan! God damn you! Bastard! Reyhan. My Reyhan. What took you so long? I got back as fast as I could. Did he wake up? No, he slept like an angel. My cutie, look at that beauty. As handsome as his father. Nurhan! Welcome. Thank you. So, were you able to impress Mr. Necati? A fight broke out at the table. What fight? They kicked out Veysel. Veysel was there? Yes. He came and sat down without being invited. And? – Then he drank and started talking too much. They got mad at him and kicked him out. So shameless! Don't change the subject. Did you impress Mr. Necati? Did you cut the tomatoes nicely? Will you start a fight with Havva now? Look at me, Miss Havva! Don't get your hopes up. I'm the one going back. What's it to me? Go back if you want! Sure I'll go back! Do you think I'd collect cow dung here, forever? Not so loud, you'll wake the baby. I'll wash these. – At this hour? I'll just dunk them into water while Father is out. Oh, how clean and pure our sister is. Wait a bit, just let me clear out the kettle. Should we write the letter in a bit? – Sure, yes. What letter? I told you, I am writing a letter to our aunt in Ankara. I have a fountain pen, should I write with it? A fountain pen? – Yes. Where did you get it? Mother Meral gave it to me. Don't lie, girl. – I swear. She gave it to me last semester. You can't write a letter with that. We can't erase a mistake. I can write, it will be OK. When the ink runs out, what are you going to do with that pen? I have extra ink. – Did you steal it too? I didn't steal anything. I said, Mother gave it to me! No shouting, you two. She gave it to me because I write nicely. How jealous you are! So she just loved your handwriting! Neriman is not like Meral. She won't let you go to middle school. Don't get on my nerves! Good lord. Instead of worrying about me, look at the one next to you. There are others who wish to replace you. What are you saying, girl? Veysel was nagging Mr. Necati all night. He said they're moving to town. He'll work at the gas station. And Reyhan will look after the kids daytime. Who said that? Veysel? – Veysel, who else? Well, look at that! What did Mr. Necati say? He kicked him away from the table. – Oh, mine! What kinds of plans Veysel and Mrs. Reyhan have been making! What plans, girl? I had no idea. Of course not. ''I look after the kids, you at the gas station." Don't piss me off! Veysel made it up by himself. Veysel couldn't think of something like that. Obviously he got some help to plan this. Everybody wants to take over my spot. Forgive me Havva, I couldn't know that the devious snake was actually over here. What did you say? I'll beat you! You foul-mouthed whore! Sister, stop it, both of you! Mr. Nuri, don't go to that old mine. It's really dangerous. It's still bothering me. What's that? We behaved shamefully. – To whom? To Veysel, of course. Please, Mr. Necati. Not at all. He just wanted a job. Is that a crime? He behaved stupidly and bothered you. I even said that I envied his life here. Forget about Veysel now, Mr. Necati! I won't. Chief, Veysel might be a shepherd. But Veysel is Veysel. Veysel is a human being. Poor guy just wanted a job. You didn't do anything. We kicked him out. Let's call him and make peace with him. It's best we just forget about it. I was really harsh on him. Go fetch him, so we can make things right. All in all, he just wanted a job. Is that a crime? Veysel is also a human being. You have to treat others as you wish to be treated yourself. Peace be upon... – Ah! It's you. You scared me. Dammit, you made me get pee on my pants. I was just talking about you. I was telling Sevket that he should fetch you and we'd make things right. Oh. Why's that? Didn't I treat you unfairly? How so? Don't even mention it. Come, why don't we sit down, share some more raki? No, I should go. And please forgive me if I did something wrong. No. The fault lies with me. Don't mention it. No, I treated both you and Reyhan somewhat unfairly. After all, Reyhan took good care of my children. I should have helped you. But I couldn't. You told Sevket that we'd have a wedding and you would take care of the expenses. And so we waited for it. Neriman did not like that idea. That's why we couldn't do it... Of course, you know best. Now I want to help you out. If you could just arrange a job. The gas station would be very good. I'll see about the gas station. The gas station would be the best. Okay, I'll have a look. Is that a promise? I already said I promised. But don't forget when you go back. Veysel! – I mean it's possible. We are drunk now, tomorrow we may forget. I just don't want this to end up like your wedding promise. Look here, Veysel! First of all, you have to learn to listen. Learn how to talk to your elders. I didn't like how you spoke to your father-in-law either. No, with all due respect, but... Look, you're still not listening. You keep interrupting me. That's not what I'm saying. What I want to say is this: Reyhan counts as your daughter. And there's Gokhan. If you find me a job... Fine! – But if you say, I don't want Reyhan in my house, that's your call. Why do you keep dragging Reyhan into this conversation? Reyhan this, Reyhan that! You misunderstood me. Of course, you thought that I would believe all the gossip. What gossip? You must have heard it too. People say really strange things. What do they say? As I said, I don't believe a word of it. But people talk, you know. They say that the pharmacist's apprentice was just a cover. What the hell is the truth? You'd know it better. What the hell is the truth? What is it? You son-of-a-bitch! What's the truth then? Bastard! What's gotten into you? Why are you hitting me, Mr. Necati? I'm telling you what everyone else is saying. So why are you hitting me? Don't come closer, or I'll shoot. Take it down! Stop there or I'll shoot. It's how others talk. I said it's all just gossip. Why did you hit me? Shut the hell up. Why are you so angry, Mr. Necati? Or is it because it could be true? Is that why you're so angry? I said shut up! Shut the hell up! Bastard, I'm going to kill you! Are you a bandit now? Don't hit me! Bastard! I'm going to kill you! Guys, that's enough. Is that a toy in your hand? Enough. – Fuck you, you son-of-a-bitch. Enough. – He's still swearing at us. It's over. And it's been... So long since... – What? So long since... ...we've seen the children. Havva, would you go out and see what she's doing? You mean Nurhan? Yes. I hope she's not eating the house. I won't go. As if I crave for Mr. Necati's house. You don't? Well, if you don't, tell Father. He's doing all this for you. Well... I miss my own house. I miss my mother. I miss my Metin. Oh, poor Metin. Oh, dear God, you are all-powerful of course. But why did you take such an innocent life? Come now... My sweetheart? Don't start this again. It's my fault, of course. Havva, my dear, don't cry. I had a dream the other day. What was it about? We were in the house after the funeral. I'm distributing sherbet. Then suddenly those in the house start to look at me strangely. I don't know why they look at me so strange. Why were they looking at you? I don't know. Then I go to the kitchen. Mrs. Gulnur, our neighbor, comes into the kitchen. I ask her, "Why is everyone looking at me so strange?" She says, "Oh girl, your belly is up to your nose." So I look at myself and my belly. It's swollen. What could it mean, my dear? I say, "My God, when did I get pregnant?" I immediately go to the back room. I start to push and push. And a head starts to come out between my legs. I look at the baby's face. It's the same face as Metin's. Then I start screaming, "Tell Mother, I gave birth to Metin." Oh, my dear! What kind of dream is that? Havva. Nothing bad happened to you, right? No, nothing. You didn't do anything stupid, right? No, why would I, sister? Sometimes... ...one does stupid things. My dear. Don't be as naive as I was. Why are you saying that, sister? I came to Mr. Necati's house in rags and with a head full of lice. Neriman took me and turned me around. First she gave me a good scrub. Then she dressed me up, made me look like a woman. But I was ungrateful towards Neriman. Mankind is ungrateful. Don't be ungrateful. Sister, I don't get what you're saying. I was going to say this... When I went to the town, I was a poor village girl. In that house, I thought I became a woman. And later on... I began to see myself as the lady of the house. One day I opened my eyes and I was back in the village. I saw my belly growing slowly. I went to the forest secretly. I gave birth to Gokhan, pushing him out on my own. Then... I found my own way to town. My Gokhan in my arms. To Mr. Necati's house. I thought they would look after him there. That's why I took him there, left him on the doorstep. It was raining like crazy. On my way back, I fell somewhere and fainted. Just lying there. That was where I had a dream. An old man came by. He held me by the hand and helped me up. He asked me what I was doing there and told me to go home. I said my house was really far away. "It's not far", he said, "Your house is just around the corner." He said they were waiting for me. And they would take me in. I told him they wouldn't take me. He said, "They will take you. They have to. They have no milk for the kids, but you have. You're going to look after them in that house. So that all the kids grow up together." I got up and walked towards the house. Havva, get over here. Mr. Necati is on his way. Come over and clear the table. I'm sorry, Mr. Necati. But Veysel is a half-wit. No one in the village listens to him. Nobody pays attention to him. Whatever... It's not that important. I also lost it back there, but... It's clear that the man is insane. Right, he's insane. He's a lunatic. His father was like that, too. He was out of his head. In the end, he hung himself from a tree at the entrance of the village. Okay, never mind. So, what shall we do about my mother-in-law? What? My mother-in-law? Oh yeah, what did you say she had? A hernia? No, you said that. I described the pain and you said it's a hernia. Then it's probably a hernia. Bring her to town and I'll have a look. – Will do. Father, I beg of you, forgive me. I don't want to stay here. My girl, how many times have you been told? I'm so sorry, I swear. Didn't we tell you that was your last warning? I love the children so much. Both Emre and Ozgur, I love them. I miss them already. I would never do anything to harm them. I was just a little mad at Ozgur. Oh, my girl. Why didn't you think of that before? I swear I didn't mean any harm. And my mother never reprimands Ozgur. So I thought I would reprimand him. Then maybe he wouldn't wet the bed anymore. My girl, are we supposed to ask you how to raise Ozgur? No, of course not. If you could take me with you now. I swear to God, I won't do it again. There, there, my baby. Shame on you! You just had to go sit with the gentlemen! Ugh, you stink of raki! What do you know about drinking raki? What happened? Did you embarrass yourself there? You're a disgrace, shame on you, in front of Mr. Necati... At the very least, a man should know his place. Who gave you that idea of moving to town? Just what are you trying to do with your half brain, without asking me? If a man has no brain himself, he should ask for advice from someone else. Gokhan! Oh good God! Chief, what happened? Did they find the bastard? No, they didn't. As soon as I get to town, I'll let the gendarmes know. Don't do anything until the forensic doctor comes. Sure thing. Well, there was nothing we could have done. Mr. Necati, our Havva, if you can think about her... Now's not the time for that. Right. Peace be upon you. – And upon you. Welcome, chief. Come on in, Mr. Sevket. There's good news. What is it? – Here, have a seat. Sukru, get the man a tea. Shall I make you another linden tea, darling? No, I don't want any. Havva, I have good news. What happened? You're going to Mr. Necati's house. Mr. Necati sent news with the village chief. Congratulations! Congratulations. I'll pack my bag then. – Don't hurry. Mr. Necati said that he will get you once the road opens. It will take some time. Mr. Necati didn't come? No, my daughter. You said he was going to come. You said the chief was going to bring him. How can he come? There's snow everywhere. The village road is closed. The chief had to walk all the way back. But look, when Mr. Necati heard you were sick, he sent antibiotics. He said, once you take these, you'll be fine in a few days. Havva, bring some water. But what if the pills don't work? He said they'd work immediately. And if they don't, he'll drive over. Sure he will. My dear, don't you worry. If it comes to that, I'll bring you to the hospital on my own back. But first, take this medicine. There now. When Mr. Necati comes, I'm going to leave with Havva. Where to? First to the town, then to Ankara. You can't be serious. Your aunt would never take you in. Do you know her better than I do? So what is this letter? Sure, sure, a letter. You think you can trick me. You know I can't read. You three conspired against me. Have the chief read it to you then. God give me patience. Then do whatever you want. I can't deal with you anymore. You're a grown woman. So take your letter and go to your aunt. We'll see how she reacts. The other day, they shot the shepherd from the village below. They slit his throat, took the flock and ran off. So we heard. – See? Well, yes. Maybe his father also spoke the truth. Maybe there were really black jinns in the mine. Well, it's possible. That mine actually collapsed after a year or two. You know what they say about crazy people, that God has given them a talent we don't have. They see things that we can't. The man has managed to hide in the mountains for months. Stop talking about that bastard. Peace be upon you. And upon you, Mr. Nuri. Mr. Nuri, those don't burn well. Stop doing this. Will you buy it or not? Fine then, put it down here. What's the matter? Father, Nurhan is not well. Did something happen? The pills didn't work. It's been three days since she took them. Come on, let's take her to the hospital ourselves. What shall we do? The roads aren't open. Let me talk to the chief again. We'll think of something. Hang tight, no need to worry. Fine, do that. Reyhan. I came to say goodbye. I'm turning myself in to the gendarmes. I'll take whatever punishment they give me. Reyhan, I'm so sorry for what I did. I can't get Gokhan's screams out of my mind. But it was an accident. I swear to God it was an accident. Please forgive me, Reyhan. You're wasting your time if you came here for this. I thought I would come see you one last time. I heard you're going to Ankara. Where did you hear that? We hear everything, Reyhan. Some people have been hiding me in the mountains. But they aren't good people. They planned to steal the sheep from the village below. So I ran away. I've been alone for so long. I don't have the energy to hide anymore. I'm at the end of my rope. I'm going to turn myself in. I wish it hadn't come to this. If only that evening hadn't turned out like that. If only you didn't despise me. I wanted to move you and Gokhan to town. I would work hard, no matter what kind of job. I thought Gokhan would get an education. If only you all didn't despise me. Forgive me, Reyhan. Please. Veysel! I'm pregnant. With your child. But I'm not going to have it. I will go to town to get an abortion. We're waiting for Mr. Necati. He'll take us soon. I have good news. I talked to the village chief. Mr. Necati is coming tomorrow for sure. The municipality promised him they'd clear the roads. Let's hold tight until tomorrow. Girl, what's with the bag? Didn't I say not to pack too early? So what? Let it be ready. Take it away. Havva, come here. When you get to Mr. Necati's house... Send the kids my love. Give Emre and Ozgur a kiss from me. My sweethearts. I miss both of them very much. Maybe Emre a little more. Tell Ozgur, he shouldn't be mad at me. He should remember me fondly. After all, I took care of them. He should pray for me. Good God, what kind of talk is this? Hang in there until tomorrow. So what if tomorrow comes? Mr. Necati won't come. Then you'll tell the roads will certainly open the following day, that we should wait just a bit longer. Tomorrow I'll take you there myself, don't worry. We three sisters will hit the road. It won't take too long to the town. Reyhan. Havva. You won't go before I get better, right? How can we leave you? Don't worry, my dear. I asked myself how I got like this. I made myself get sick. I said to myself... If I get sick, they would pity me and not let me wash the sheets. Maybe they would have taught their kid a lesson. But they just sent me to this pit. What kind of talk is that? And Mr. Necati keeps asking about you, so don't be ungrateful. He said, Nurhan is just like my own daughter. He told the chief he can drop everything and come over. But the chief said, "No need, I'll take the medicine to her." Mr. Necati said it might be several days for the medicine to work. Anyway, tomorrow he'll come and see for himself. Who's that? Hatice. – She's sick, Nurhan is sick. Be off now! Ah, ah. I told you so. You only have yourselves to blame. Father, not this again. You couldn't stay at the town. I did what I could, I placed all of you in a home in the town. But you didn't manage to stay put. Your mother and I decided to get you out of here a long time ago. She never forgot how all her sisters left and she stayed in the village. She always said, "I stayed and had to marry you, of all people." Alright, father, don't keep telling the same story over and over. Who, me? – No, me! Well, after this I won't ever tell you anything. Fine, don't. No advice, no fairy tale, no parable. Nothing! – Fine. Soon, you'll beg me. I would never beg for that. Then I'll tell it to Havva. Shall I, my girl? Thanks, but I'll pass. Ah, you ingrate! Thankfully I have my Nurhan. Give advice to those who know its worth. Right? No, it's left father. You're ingrates, all of you! You three always gang up on me. As soon as I turn my back, you're up to something. Father, be quiet for a bit, let Nurhan sleep. Let him talk, sister. Otherwise I get bored. Of course, I'll talk. I love to talk. If you ask why, it's because I never talk nonsense. All my family loved to talk. My grandfather also used to talk a lot. Sometimes the villagers would get sick of him. Still, they would come to get his advice. It's because villagers over here aren't so smart. Who does the chief ask for advice? Me, of course. Don't start praising yourself. What can I do? If no one else praises me... What can we praise about you? You're ungrateful, the whole lot of you. I've just thought of a very nice story, that my grandfather used to tell me when I was a boy. The Tale of Three Ungrateful Girls. Should I tell it to you? Sure. – I won't tell it if you just say "Sure." Should I tell my grandfather's Tale of Three Ungrateful Girls? Come on, father. "Come on, father" is not going to work. Should I tell my grandfather's Tale of Three Ungrateful Girls? No, we don't want it. "No, we don't want it" won't work either. Should I tell my grandfather's Tale of Three Ungrateful Girls? Oh lord, now we're in trouble. "We're in trouble" won't work either. Should I tell my grandfather's Tale of Three Ungrateful Girls? Cock-a-doodle-doo! "Cock-a-doodle-doo" is never going to work. Should I tell my grandfather's Tale of Three Ungrateful Girls? Sitting there quietly isn't going to work either.
