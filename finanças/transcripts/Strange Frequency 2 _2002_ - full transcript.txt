You've got the talent, you've got the looks. But you can't quite seem to make it. What you need is a manager. Now, there's good and there's bad, and they'll drive you crazy, but all you really want is for them to live up to their side of the bargain. Hey, Mitch. Hey, Nicole. What I wouldn't give to play the guitar like him. He better be good. Jason spends more time with his guitars than he does with me. That's a mistake I'd never make. Hold it, hold it, hold it! How am I supposed to play if I can't hear myself? Just give me the volume. I'll worry about the feedback. Moron. All right. You guys sound tight. Hey, baby. How's my guitar god? I thought I told you to wait in the dressing room. I like watching you play. Is that a problem? What's this? What's wrong? It's a crack. Oh, that's not... Yeah. It's a freaking crack. Maybe you should stop scamming on my girlfriend and pay attention to what you're doing. Why, it's barely a hairline crack. Purely cosmetic. Won't affect the tonality at all. Great. I think it adds character-- like a battle scar. But if your boss don't agree you bring it back and I'll give you fair market value for it. What's this? This, uh... sheet music. Now that is a real rarity. I've never seen music written like this. Jimi Hendrix's last song. He wrote it the very night he died. Apparently, the police found it laying next to his cold body in that London flat. Come on. Difficult to play, too. Why, I've tried. Just as well, though, because I'm told that if a fella ever were to play the "Hendrix Blues" he'd conjure the devil himself. Give me a break. Okay, okay. I had you going for a while, though, huh? No. The music's a fake, anyway. How do you know it's a fake? Well, Hendrix couldn't even read music let alone write it, and lookie here-- here's the other giveaway. Look at this notation here. See, this is a coda. It means "go back and repeat." Now, there's one at the beginning and there's one at the end. The song's an endless loop. Bad craftsmanship. Sloppy. Not like Jimi at all. I'll give you 50 bucks for it. Whoa, now. 50 bucks and a promise that if you ever do master the "Hendrix Blues" you come back and play it for me sometime. Deal. Good night, San Francisco! Funky tune. Oh, Jason. I'm sorry. Uh, I took the guitar to the repair shop today. I wanted to see how it sounded. It sounds great, Mitch. Uh, they said it was just a battle scar. Yeah, well, let me be the judge of that. Pack up the rest of these guitars before you break something else. Jason Astor? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to give you a start. That's all right. Uh, you just missed Jason. Oh, I heard the guitar, and I thought, uh... You mean to say that was you? Yeah. Wow! That was fantastic playing! Thanks. When are you going to add it to the set list? That song was absolutely fantastic. Well, to tell you the truth I just take care of the guitars, man. I'm not part of the band. You're kidding me. Well, then, you don't have the right management working for you. Yeah, right. I haven't got any management working for me. Well, then, it seems that our meeting is fortuitous. Simon Rathmore. Iscariot Talent. What do you want from me? I'm just a guitar tech who can hack out a few chords. Look I've been off the beaten path before. I went to a cow town in Texas. I found Stevie Ray Vaughn. I saw Kurt Cobain playing to a bunch of loggers in Washington state. Now, they were raw but they had the desire. No, you want Jason. Why do you give him so much credit, Mitch? You should see the way the crowd tenses when he strangles a note on one of his solos. It's like they're spellbound, you know? You should see-- Mitch... that could be you up there. Why are you polishing his boots when he's up there living your dream? Don't fear success. Don't fear your desires. You should see the way his girlfriend looks at him. You like her, don't you? Well, she could be yours. I mean, just visualize that. Well, I'm in a position at Iscariot to help you realize your potential. Now, if you sign with us we would do everything in our power to make things happen for you. Nobody's ever believed in me before. Oh, I have faith in you, Mitch. I just want you to have faith in me. I guess we have a deal, then. Indeed we do. Good lick! Nice. That was really great, Mitch. Well, listen to the boy go. Just warming her up for you. Oh, relax. Let's have a little fun. Show me what you got. That's nice. You've been practicing. Yeah. Uh, is that it? Hey, you don't even want to go there. Hmm. Progressions) Unbelievable. Um, look, man, I'm sorry. I-I just got kind of carried away there. Get these re-strung. Yeah. And then get out. What? Tonight's your last show. You're fired. That is hard core. I'll talk to him. That's too bad. Let's get to work. All right. Yeah. Uppity bastard. I need this job, Simon. This small-time thinking has to stop. You have to believe in your talent. What good is talent when nobody knows who you are? Rome wasn't burned in a day. We just need to get you in front of an audience. Showcase your talent. You'll set the house ablaze. Where is he? He's coming. What a diva. I'm sorry you got fired. Yeah, well, I guess I asked for it. I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. Oh, don't be. I like the way you play. All right, let's rock and roll. Here we go. Gentlemen? Oh! Damn it, damn it. Jason, Jason, are you okay? Damn it, damn it. What the hell's going on? Get the first aid kit. He cut his hand. Somebody better be on that stage in one minute playing some very entertaining rock and roll for the kiddies, or I'm going to sue you all for breach. You need a doctor, man. No, I'll be okay in a minute. You're not gonna play guitar tonight. What about Mitch? He's a roadie. He's a guitar tech. The dude can rock and he knows the songs. Will you do it? Come on, Mitch. You'll set the house ablaze. What did you say? Do it for me. Go home! Go home! Who does this kid think he is? Good night, San Francisco! Well, Mitch, was it everything you expected? More. I'm so buzzed right now. You did it, kid. I couldn't believe my ears. That was unbelievable, Mitch! Hey, later, Mitch. Nicole? Mitch? Nicole... Mitch! Nicole! This is Jason's limo. Not anymore, it isn't. You're a star now. A toast. To realizing your potential. This is amazing. Simon, this is amazing. The affection of the masses. It's a powerful thing, Mitch. Mitch? Nicole. Nicole! Nicole! Holy cow! They love you, Mitch. Can't you just feel the energy? Simon, I want her here. If you say so. Oh, my... God. Let's not bring him into this. Nicole? Get away from the car. Step back. Do something. Stardom is hard on relationships, Mitch. Everybody knows that. Mitch, please...! Who are you? The "Hendrix Blues." You're really him? Why is everyone always surprised that it's me? Did you really think that you were doing this? This is over. I want out. Oh, it doesn't really work like that. I mean, I've fulfilled my side of the contract. I've given you talent, I've given you stardom and for a moment, love. Now you can have all these things for the rest of your natural life or would you prefer that we settle your account now? My soul. You won't get my soul. Open up! What the hell do you want? It's true. The music is cursed. I played the song, and he came. He passes himself off as an A&R guy and I, uh I signed a contract. So what do you want from me? You sold me the cursed music. Sorry. I don't need a refund. I need help. He-he wants my soul. Ooh! Now that is heavy. There is something I picked up. A spiritual. I'm told it was written by Mother Teresa for the Pope. Will playing something holy reverse this? Well, it's worth a try. I got it out back. I'll go and get it. Just who do you think you're dancing with? Some genie you can put back in the bottle? But... you... Oh, you are a fun one. "I'm told it was written by Mother Teresa for the Pope." You should have seen your face Mitch. It was priceless. You set me up from the beginning. You suckered me into buying that music and signing that contract. I'm tearing up over here Mitch. I'm having a great time, and I like you. Let's go double or nothing. What do you mean? You play this music flawlessly till the last note and I'll destroy our contract. You fail... and I take your soul tonight. We have a deal? Okay. Flawlessly now. Son of a bitch! Oh, Mitch, I do like you. You are so much fun. You are so easy. You just fall off a truck? I'll just keep playing. Yeah well, that's what Hendrix said. Hey, Mitch? You want to play with the big boys you've got to pay. I did it. I beat you. You recognize that, Mitch? Return to coda. Go back and start again. Want to buy some sheet music cheap? I know a guy who'll cut you a sweet deal. Ever try writing a song? It's not easy. Inspiration can be elusive and record company deadlines only make things worse. No wonder so many songwriters seek inspiration in an altered state. You're not worth it. Yes, go ahead. With all the bands on tour this season isn't it a bit of a risk to embark on a stadium tour? Maybe. But, uh, we like the stadiums because it doesn't matter how we sound. We just let the fireworks do all the work. The pyrotechnics will be spectacular. We've got the same team that produced the Stones' Bridges to Babylon tour. Yes, next question. Why is the band bringing a second guitarist along for the tour? We feel a second guitarist will help fill out our sound, especially in the larger venues. Isn't he an insurance policy in case you can't finish the tour, Jared? Okay, uh, next question, please? Jared, I understand you've had writer's block since being released from rehab. That's not true. I have been writing and things are coming together, and... you know? The songs will be there. This tour seems like a lot of pressure for a recovering addict. Does anyone have a question not related to past drug use? Okay, that concludes the Q and A. What I've learned is... I have made a commitment... not to let down this band or our fans ever again. What I've learned is that the temptation is with me wherever I go... at home, in rehab, or on stage and I have to deal with it every day. More coffee? Thanks. That's all right. Hey. That was some press conference today. The vultures were circling. I'm used to it. May I? If I say no, you going to uh, write a hatchet job for Spin? That's not my style. Okay. That's pretty tame as far as stimulants go. I don't want to be rude, but, uh... I do need a little quiet. It's nice meeting you. "A little quiet" isn't cutting it. As I recall, you were riding the speedway through Minneapolis off your head. Yet, after three stops you managed to write one of your best songs. What was it again? "Mr. Wednesday." "Mr. Wednesday." How did you know that? Who are you? A fan. I spend a lot of time with musicians, and let's face it, you guys aren't like ordinary people. Really. I've heard you channel heaven through your guitar and create something Hendrix Joplin, Jim Morrison. Well, I don't know that I'm in that company. Oh, you could be. You see, they weren't afraid to throw open the doors of perception and walk in. Have you ever written a song sober? You already know the answer to that, don't you? I think it's time you were honest about who you are and what it takes to get you to that place. Can I get you anything else? Uh... The engine always runs hotter with heavy fuel. Two shots of whiskey, please. All right. Sure thing. Come on, Jared, don't beat yourself up. When I got out of rehab I knew I was blocked. Not a riff in me. But when I'm high, it's like I'm... floating through this tunnel of images. It's all there. Mm-hmm. There you go. Bottoms up. Now... that's living. Miss? Bring the bottle, please. In her purse... she's got an old, yellow photograph of her daughter. The daughter she refuses to talk to. She looks at that picture every day. She can't throw it away. And why don't they talk? She was a teen mom and blames the daughter for taking her youth. The girl forgives her but the old woman won't forgive herself. ♪ It's in the way you make me feel ♪ ♪ Only the pain that keeps me real... ♪ See? You're on a roll now. Five songs. You're my muse, aren't you? No, I don't get hung up on labels. You wrote those songs, Jared. You opened the doors all by yourself. He can be replaced. Look, Jared will be here, all right? I'm not sitting through another one of his flameouts. Hey, guys. You started without me. Hi, Jared. I've been writing, man. I'm out of control. I got the songs. Freakin' great songs. Don't sweat it, Jared. We'll just take it out of your share. All right. That's funny. You got a sense of humor, Pete. That's good. Very progressive, Jared. You know, great chord structure. Hey, a little respect for the man here. Wait... wai... you wouldn't know a good song if it... if it... Look, I told you, Jared, it's the junk or us. This attitude is getting a little thick. I'm the writer and singer. How hard do you think it will be for me to find a new backup band? Harder than staying clean. I doubt that. We've got an entire solo album to create and that calls for some serious inspiration. ♪ Just where we're going... ♪ Which way is it? Hey, man... Upstairs. That works.

Chris. You're lucky you didn't kill anyone. I know. I-I screwed up. Sorry. Yeah. Save it. What, are you on a diet of moldy cheese and baking soda? I've never written anything when I was straight. Ever. Can you believe that? Look, forget about the songs. Forget about the tour. Just get yourself together. I'm all right, Chris. I am. I just got to start over. Today's day one of my sobriety.

You are truly damaged. I'm a recovering alcoholic and drug addict. Oh, who isn't? I have no control of my life. Who does? We're done. You can let yourself out or go poof or do whatever muses do. I'm going to bed. You're such a lightweight. I'm sorry. You know, it's, uh... Here. But it's late and... I get a little cranky without my crank. That's charming.

I'm... This mantra is pissing me off. I am an addict. I have no control over my life. A greater... I found the hidden treasure. Oh, and it looks magically delicious. I don't want this. I want to quit. It's a little late for that. You've got me all hot and bothered. I'm going clean. I don't want you anymore. Come on, Jared, it's me you're talking to. We licked coke off a bus station toilet. This isn't real. The hell it's not. No, that's too much. You're going to kill me! Relax. You're not going to OD. I'd never let that happen. Please don't do this. Please. You know... you're a real drag until you get that first beer in you-- true sign of an antisocial personality. I'll do whatever you want-- anything. All I want is to party with you. Chris! Chris! Help! Jared, are you in there? He has a key. Get rid of him. Jared? Yeah? Hey, I was starting to worry. These are heavy.

Come on, Jared it's time to fly. I'm always with you. No. I can stop. I can quit you. That attitude has caused you endless grief. Let me take you away. No, I don't need you. I don't want to be negative here but you're nothing without me... a creatively bankrupt has-been a sloppy junkie... a murderer. I didn't kill him. A friend-murderer. Now, that's got to be worse. You stay away from me. Oh, cut the drama, Jared. Let's put this friend-murdering business behind us and go play. Then what? Huh? When will you be satisfied? I can't get no satisfaction. I can break you. Take the needle. Without me, you're nothing. I'm clean. Take the needle. I'm clean! Take the needle! I'm clean! I'm finally clean. No! Wow... never saw anyone break this many bones before and live. Course, won't be much of a life. We may have to increase the morphine drip. 164 broken bones. Morphine on the hour.

She won't be any trouble. Sorry. Well, if she can't go, then I don't want to. Suit yourself. Lara, go-- this is a once-in-a-lifetime moment. No, no, not without you. Go on. Go, go. Are you sure?

Good, let's go. I'm Vince. Hi. Hi. I'm Lara. It's pretty crazy, huh? Yeah. Vince, your music means so much to me and I can't even explain to you how much it affects me. Oh, yeah? There's-there's a depth and a personal strength that I can totally relate to. You got that? Very cool. You want to go in the back? It's quieter, we can talk. Yeah, okay. Vince, when... when you looked at me before I felt this... you know, connection. I've never real... Vince, please, can we just talk... Stop! Here's your T-shirt. So, how was it? Lara, oh, my God. Wha...? Are you okay? What happened to you? You have to report this. What am I going to say? That some big rock star invited me on his bus and I went? You did not ask for this. You know that they'll say I did. I can't believe I was so stupid. Nuh-uh, no way. This is not your fault. How could he do this to me? Lar... I mean, how many other women...? Someone has to do something. Yeah, like what? Castration's too good for this guy. Castration may be a place to start. Look, hey... I know that this doesn't mean much now but sooner or later, he will get what he deserves. Karma will bite him on the ass. We should get some sleep. Good night, you.

Listen, I need to talk to her... to, uh, Vince. And I repeat, in your dreams. Look, I'm, uh I'm... I'm Vince's sister. Okay? I'll prove it to you. His wife is supermodel Annie-May But her real name is Annibell Marie Stephens. Get lost. His birthday, January 20, 1976. Yeah, and, um, what time was he born? What time was he born? Uh, I don't... I don't know. In the morning? In the afternoon. 2:37 p.m. at St. Jude's Hospital in Austin, Texas. I'm his, uh, sister, too. Shut up! He's got a dog named Brando after Marlon Brando. The two of you shut up now! You sisters seriously need to get a life. Now, please, step back or I'm calling the cops. No, look, I've got... Just step back. Cops. Hotel operator. Yeah, Vince Brava's room. I'm sorry, there's no guest by that name. I... I mean Vinnie Salami. One moment, please. I want $50,000 to go to the National Organization for Women. I'm not even sure NOW still exists. It does. Write it. And $50,000 to go to a rape crisis center in every city we play. This is a worldwide tour. You'll go broke. Yes? Is Lara Plasky there? No, there's no Lara Plasky here. I'll take that. Give me the phone. Excuse me. Hello? What did you do to me? Oh, it's you. I don't know how this happened, but it did.

Oh, my God, I love you so much! How did you get in here? Oh, your music means everything to me! Who are you? When you looked at me in the concert I felt something, a connection. We are soul mates. Soul mates? Yeah, the way you looked at me, I knew. I just knew it was true. Okay, all right, take a deep breath, okay? Okay. What's your name? Angie. Angie. Angie, sit down. Okay. Okay. Angie, I hate to break this to you but we're not soul mates. Well, you can't say that. I mean, you just met me. I'm not who you think I am. I know all about you, Vince Brava. If you did you wouldn't be here. Why are you saying these things? Because Vince Brava is a pig. There is nothing in here that you want. I... I really thought you'd like me. I don't deserve someone like you. And you know what, Angie? When the truth about me comes out you'll be embarrassed that you ever wanted to know me. I understand. What'll it take to get upstairs? They're nice, huh? Can I help you? Yeah, hey, Randall, I need to see Vince. Vince is in the hospitality suite. No, I mean, I'm Vince and this girl's me. Man, we swapped bodies. How do you think that happened? I don't know how it happened, man. I'm backstage after the concert, she's kissing me and next thing I know I'm getting kicked to the curb. Rock and roll can get a little crazy. Yeah, tell me about it, man. Come on, guys. Please see that she finds a cab and find out how the hell she got up here. Randall, it's me... Randall, I'm Vince! Look, I hired you after... after Hanson canned you! I took you in when Jasmine threw you out! I'm Vince Brava! Get your hands off me! I'm going! Get your hands off! Have a super night.

What about me? You wanted me and you know it. Now give me back my body! How does it feel, huh? How does it feel to be held against your will? Know why you get pushed around, hmm? Because you're weak. You're a nobody. It doesn't matter what body I'm in. If I want you, I can have you. You need to know how it feels. I'm going to make you pay for what you did. What the hell are you doing? You want my body, huh? Stop it! Come on. You know you want it... Get off me or I'll scream! Go ahead, scream. See what good it's going to do. I'm Vince Brava. Help! Help, someone, help! Whoa, now is not a good time. You know you want it. Kiss me, baby. No, no...! Get off her! I said, get off her! No, she switched bodies. She switched bodies! She switched bodies! Make her kiss me again! Randall! Randall, you don't understand. She set me up! Do unto others. What goes around comes around. Don't accept backstage passes from strangers. It's funny how a song can take you back. You hear the first few notes and suddenly you're transported back to your high school prom your wedding night, or the worst day of your life. If only we knew then what we know now. ...and the bad news continues tonight for the Stanton campaign. With 37 % of the precincts reporting the one-time front-runner now trails with just 23 % of the vote. Let's just wait until the other districts check in. We'll finish strong. Ben? Yeah. Will you excuse me for a minute, honey? Sure, darling. Yeah? It's over. You sure? Only a third of the districts... Our exit polls show it's the same across the state. It's over. Well, I guess it's about that time. Yeah. It's about that time. Your wife drafted some remarks. Did she? Usual stuff-- thank the volunteers fought the good fight. Is there anybody downstairs to hear them? I won't lie-- it's pretty bleak. More reporters than supporters. Ross, I want to take the time to tell you that I appreciate all the things you've... Save it. Let's just do this and get it over with. I just wanted to say that if... if I could do things over again... You should have thought about that weeks ago before you got involved with that girl... before you got in that car. Do you realize how much time I have spent... No, I'm not going to do this. I'm not. Ross... Just look over the speech. I'll let the press know we'll be down in ten minutes. We have many more district races to report to you but first we return to Megan and Ken in the studio for more on the Stanton campaign. Megan? We're joined by political reporter Dean Spencer Andrews. Dean, the Stanton campaign has to be one of the biggest meltdowns in political history. No question, Megan. Just two weeks ago Stanton was as upbeat as the famous song that became his anthem. Then, quite literally, his bid for the senate crashed into pieces. Please, no... n-no questions. I came from that direction and then this guy just runs into the road flagging me down. We tried to save the woman, but... it was just too late. That woman, as we all now know was 23-year-old campaign worker Denise Cole, later revealed to be Stanton's lover. Cole, a native of Tacoma, studied political science at the University of Washington. She worked on several statewide races before joining the Stanton campaign ten months ago. For God's sake. Uh... I was just watching the latest... Yeah, the latest is, she's still dead. Maggie, I never wanted... Listen, you were supposed to break it off, buy her silence. That was the deal. I tried. What, by going off for the weekend with her? If I'd known you'd try to keep her on the side I'd have paid her off myself. Sweetheart, we... Don't call me sweetheart. I am not your sweetheart. I am your wife. And for the next 30 minutes I will play the part. I will smile, I will hold your hand. I'll even give you that sympathetic, understanding look I've become so good at the last couple of weeks but after that, we're through. We've been through for years. Let me ask you something, Ben. Did you even for a minute think about what this meant to me? My plans, my dreams? Yeah, I didn't think so. Put on a fresh shirt and pick a different tie. Never mind. I'll do it myself. You know the best thing about losing-- I'll never have to hear that damn song again. Hey, they're playing it again. I thought you'd like to have it. It's the one I burned the night we chose this song. It's great. Thanks. ♪ ...I can see ♪ ♪ It took so long to realize... ♪ It's perfect for the campaign. Retro for the younger voters and nostalgic for the older folks. Not that you're old or anything. You're not falling asleep on me, are you, Senator? No, I'm just tired. I like the sound of that. Senator Ben Stanton. Maybe this will wake you up. Hey, watch the road. Sorry. ♪ I see beyond the road I'm drivin'... ♪ Denise... we have to talk-- about us. You sound serious. These next few weeks are critical. We have to be careful. If word about us were to get out... I don't get it. Are you dumping me? No, I'm not dumping you. We just have to cool it a little. Okay. Okay? You're right. This is dangerous. You've worked too hard on this and you're so close. You sure it's okay? I knew what I was getting into, Ben. Well, I'm relieved. I thought... What? That I'd have a breakdown? It's just a few weeks. Ben... A month, tops. I'm fine. And if you need money... Whoa, you're offering me money? Is that what's in the bag? Hey, careful. So, how much am I worth to you? Are you paying me by the hour? Or maybe you're paying me... Watch the road! ♪ I see beyond the road I'm drivin' ♪ What happened? Denise, are you okay? Uh, I-I can't...

Help! Help! Please stop! We've had an accident! She's trapped! Denise! Did you say something? Um, no, no, nothing. Here, put this on. Wha...? Um... Have you read the remarks? Just stick to what's on the page and no improvising. Can you stop, just for one minute? Can you stop trying to plan... Let go of me. My arm! I only wish it were a sharp, stabbing pain radiating to your chest. If I could have done things differently I would have. Differently? How? Would you never have gotten involved with her? Or would you just have avoided getting caught that day? Yeah, that's what I thought. Now, get dressed.

Better hurry-- don't want to keep the press waiting. Right. My concession. Concession-- very funny. Once again, we predict that Ben Stanton will be the new senator by a margin of two to one. Maggie wrote up some remarks. My arm, I had a... What about your arm? Nothing. Usual stuff-- your admiration and respect for the prick who ran against you thanking the volunteers for a perfect campaign. Get dressed, Senator. Destiny awaits. How do I look? Every inch the senator. Well, I couldn't have done this without you. No, of course you couldn't. Funny how a song can take you back sometimes. Did she really mean that much to you? Maggie... I've been thinking-- about the money the investigators found at the crash. Yes? They haven't been able to trace it back to you, yet and they never will if we say she stole it. I can't... We'll come across as very sympathetic-- how we delayed coming forward out of respect for the dead. Ben... we have to be smart here. We have to play to win. Just like you did when you left the crash site. Can you imagine if they'd caught you with her? So you'd ruin her reputation? Yeah, to save our own. That money is the only thing that could connect you to her. It's the only way. Okay, okay, let's go. Don't forget the speech. Um, why don't you go ahead. I-I still have something to do. Well, you don't have much time, Senator. I can change things. I can save her.

I'm not sure... but I think everything's fine now. : What has gotten into you? Nothing. Everything's perfect. Okay, we're going to have to cool things for a while-- just until after the election-- and then I want you to find a place in DC. Are you serious? Look. I've brought enough money to get you settled. Uh... Ben... Everything's going to work out. I am going to be senator. I know. No, I mean it. Don't ask me how, but I know it's going to happen. And we're going to be together.

Don't go, Ben. You have to let go. For God's sake, let go! Ben... Ben! You have to let go! Ben! No! Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next senator from the great state of Washington! Thank you. Thank you so much. Well, what a night. Two weeks ago, I would never have believed that I would be standing before you as the senator-elect. When I was asked to take Ben's place on the ballot, my first response was... disbelief. My place was at my husband's side. But even as he lay unconscious, I could feel his spirit move me. Ben's dream of a brighter future is a dream I needed to keep for him... Tonight is about the future-- a future of limitless opportunities.
