("Claire de Lune" acapella-female) (chimes) (sexy, bluesy music) - "Gray Is The New Blonde" is a documentary whose time has come. Women all across the world of all ages and ethnicities are choosing on purpose to ditch the hair dye and embrace their gorgeous grays. This is truly a movement. Never before in history have we seen so many women choose on purpose to embrace their gorgeous grays. I am over the moon with excitement to bring this film to you, and I hope you enjoy it. Growing up in the '70s, the only people that I ever recall seeing with gray hair were people who were really old. I'm talking 80s and 90s. I never, ever saw women in their 30s or 40s or 50s with gray hair. And what's interesting is that research shows that most people start to see a sprinkling of gray when they're in their late teens to early to mid-20s. And what you are about to see is that the majority of women that I interviewed in fact also saw their first grays very young. (bubbly music) - By the time I was maybe, like 16, I had a whole streak coming down the side of my hair. One long streak of gray. - I actually didn't see my first gray hair. My girlfriend saw my first gray hair when we were standing at the bus stop when I was 15. We were going downtown to go shopping, and she reached over and she said, "Hey, you've got a gray hair." And then she plucked it from my head. - I saw it when I was in high school. I must have been a junior or senior and I saw one gray hair, it was pretty long. I plucked it and since then, I've been on this journey of coloring my hair. - Well, I had a few rogue gray hairs growing in my 20s. - We did our research and 18, 19 were the ones that really came up the most that started to go silver at that younger of an age. - I started going gray at 17. My mother will swear that she plucked the first white hair from my head at age four. - [Reporter] 35-year-old Andrea Fishkin started to see silver strands peek through when she was just 12 years old. - I felt that maybe there was something wrong with me, like why am I graying so early in my life? - [Reporter] Hair goes gray when color producing cells stop producing pigment. Scientists don't know exactly why some people go gray early, but genes play a large role. - The very first time I knew that I had a gray hair was when I was 27 years old. I was standing in the gym, I guess I was by the front register desk area, and someone that I knew from the gym, I knew this person and I seem to recall it was a male, very casually, not a bestie at all, walks up to me and says, "Oh, you have a gray hair," and proceeds to yank it out of my head. - I was 26 when I saw my first gray hair. - When I saw my first gray hair, I believe I was 20 years old, sophomore in college, and I just thought, "Oh my gosh, I'm getting old." (laughs) That's basically what I thought. - This is such a double standard because I started getting grays when I was 18 and everyone says it looks distinguished, it's great. I love it, I have no problem with the grays, but it's obviously such a different experience for women. - With a man, it can give him a sense of authority. With a woman, however, it can look like she doesn't care about herself. - When Anderson Cooper has gray hair, they call him the silver fox. A woman who has gray hair is like, "Nana, can I help you with your bags?" (audience laughing) - Yes, exactly. It's a double standard. - 'Cause it's such a double standard. For guys with gray hair they're distinguished, but women I think feel such pressure not to allow themselves to have gray hair and I think it looks great. - Yeah, well I thank you for pioneering it. - Well, yes, I, it's right, yeah. - This double standard has been in existence for thousands and thousands of years. It's rooted in the original role that men and women played in life. Looks were important. Women were to attract a mate, they procreate. And then they died before they even saw gray hair not that long ago, 100 years ago. Men on the other hand were about protecting their clan, being powerful and strong. Gray hair actually enhanced that role. They were seen as more senior leaders. - There's a patriarchal world that we live in where our value is measured by men and it has to with procreation, fertility, submission. - [Karen] All men have gray hair. (laughs) - [Victoria] Yes. - So it's just like why is it okay for them and not me, so that's kinda -my attitude, I think, just projecting that to people. - But I do think that there's a double standard when it comes to men, and men are distinguished and women just are old. But we're here, of course, to break that stereotype. (transitional chimes) - Indeed we are, Sandra, indeed we are. And the days of this double standard are clearly numbered. This outdated view that women are no longer attractive and somehow less desirable has begun to fade, pun intended. And my thought has been how did we get here as a society? What has happened in our past to bring us to this point to where we revere men, they're distinguished, they're worldly, they're sophisticated, but for women, oh my goodness, it's quite different. And how did we as a society get here? Well, the research is fascinating and it begins to shed some light on how we did get here. - [Narrator] In 1891, an ad for Imperial Hair Regenerator stated, quote, "No lady who thoroughly "appreciates good appearance would ever dream "of appearing in society with streaky or gray hair. "They are both unbecoming "and when a perfect preparation can be obtained "for overcoming these difficulties, "there is no reasonable justification for the continuance." The message in all such ads was clear: no woman should have gray hair, and these products provided a way to stem that most visible sign of aging. Nevertheless, even with intensive advertising only about 7% of American women dyed their hair by mid-century. The modern hair coloring revolution came through clever, image changing advertising. (inspirational, powerful piano music) - [Woman] Coloring my hair is such a job. Sectioning, dipping, repeated color checks. - [Woman] Dull, streaked with gray. Even with this perfect makeup, she looks faded, unattractive. - [Man] If your hair is dull or faded or streaked with gray, try Miss Clairol Hair Color. - With Miss Clairol, the color looks so natural. Only your hairdresser knows for sure. - [Man] Easy to do, apply like shampoo. - [Woman] In minutes, she looks years younger. - My gray hair makes me feel so old, you know what I'm gonna do? ♪ I'm gonna wash that gray right out of my hair ♪ ♪ I'm gonna wash that gray right out of my hair ♪ - [Man] Loving Care Color Lotion from Clairol washes away your gray and washes in your own natural color. ♪ So I washed that gray right out of my hair ♪ ♪ Oh yes, I washed that gray right out of my hair ♪ - [Man] Wash that gray right out of your hair with Clairol Loving Care. - So many Americans color their hair. It's over 75%. So that now becomes the reality. And so being natural seems to be the oddity as opposed to, like, my hair's blonde. Well, maybe it was but it isn't anymore. - [Reporter] Debbie Lyman is at the salon every two weeks covering her gray, unlike her twin Naomi. - I'm jealous, I admit it. - I just feel liberated and I get so many compliments that I feel like it's my best feature. - There's so many unhappy people out there dying their hair every three weeks and they're not even thinking that there's another way. - What was the turning point that you said I just am not gonna dye my hair anymore? I was thinking the turning point was going to be when you learned about the tumor. So I thought, okay, then that had, but no. - Yeah, I had not even thought about it 'cause it was such a thing that everybody dyed their hair. My mom had pretty gray hair young and she always dyed her hair, so I didn't even think about don't dye your hair, it was just like oh, whatever, this is normal. I'm just gonna keep dying my hair. - I was just willing to go get it colored 'cause that's all that I knew back then. - I just feel like these women are stuck doing, you know, how they have to color their hair every three weeks, two weeks, one week, it's too much. - And then it comes back to money. So you're talking about trying to knock out a system that's been working really well for the people that are in power, and that's, you know, what do you want, a revolution? - A lot of women feel insecure all the time because of how the media makes us feel. - And when we look at the economics, nobody makes money if they tell us we look good the way we are. Money is made by making us feel bad. - Advertisers will never voluntarily change because it is profitable for them when we feel terrible about ourselves. Basically we're told that women are acceptable only if we're young, thin, white, or at least light skinned, perfectly groomed and polished, plucked and shaved. And any deviation from this ideal is met with a lot of contempt and hostility. Women who are considered ugly are ridiculed in advertising campaigns. So these ads are meant to be funny, but the message to girls and women is clear. If you're not conventionally beautiful, you're an object of ridicule and contempt. Your worth depends on how you look. You're going to be graded on a curve. This contempt for women who do not measure up is waiting for all of us, of course, eventually as we age. So no wonder there's such terror of showing any signs of aging. (somber music) - I was horrified. I thought oh, if I grow it out, I'm gonna be so old, I'm gonna look old, it's gonna be horrible. - And I tried to dye my hair and keep up with it to make sure that no one knew I had any gray hair and how horrible it would be if anybody found out that I had gray hair. So I started dyeing it and of course as time went on, the grayer I got, the more I would need to dye it. - And I was embarrassed and I was ashamed that all of the sudden, I had gray hair. That's when I started dying my hair because I didn't want my friends to know about my gray hair and I actually lied. One of my friends asked me, "Oh my gosh Terry, "your hair is so nice and black and so shiny. "Did you dye it?" And I flat-out told her no, and I never felt good about not being honest with her, but I really didn't want her to know that I was having gray hair at a young age. - I was about 18 when I started seeing gray hair. At first I was totally mortified. - By the time I was 19, I had a white Elvira streak... in my right out of the top. My mother and my aunt, they took me to the store where they used to sell For Brunettes Only hair color and helped me pick out the proper shade so that I could color my hair. - [Reporter] No group in Hollywood feels the effects of ageism like women, and many celebrities have been vocal about it. Helen Mirren has critiqued the industry for age discrimination, saying Hollywood is all about youth and beauty. - There is a lot of ageism and I do, I do feel that the gray hair has hurt me. But it has not changed my resolve. I think that it's important to have somebody on television, in movies, in commercials, in magazines. I think it is important that we have silver-haired and gray-haired women represented in all of those places. - Oh yeah, I have a friend who is a hardworking actress. She's very successful, she's won two Emmys, and when I told her, I said, "Next time you see me, you may not recognize me "because I've started going gray," and she has said, "I can't do that." She said, "That would be great, "but I can't do that because of my job." - If I had gray hair, I would not have this job. I'm just saying that right now. (audience applauding) - Really? Yep. - I came to LA three and a half years ago to get into commercials. So I'm told, "Well, if you color your hair, "you might have a better chance." I won't. "If you cut your hair, because women your age "really shouldn't have long hair. "It doesn't look right." And I refused to cut my hair. I've always had long hair and it's gonna stay. - When I first was talking to Chuck about it, I said, He said, "Do you have any idea of how you wanna play her?" And I said, "Well, I think she should be gray." And he was like, "Really?" He said, "I kinda thought she should have "the same color hair that her daughter has." I said, "You know, if I'm gonna play an old woman, I really..." Also, because everybody's having their Me Too plus moment, I think we all need to kind of grab ahold of our authenticity. And it's like, what's wrong with being gray? Just because most actors, actresses, don't go, "You know, I can't wait to be gray." I myself had recently just stopped dying my hair because it was like who am I kidding? It's stupid and I was just over it. So I wanted her to be totally authentic in that way. - Being that I worked in the makeup industry, I was very on-cue to have hair that wasn't gray. - I was a singer for a while, but then when I went to Nashville the A&R guy says, "When are you gonna cover up that gray?" I really didn't like that, I didn't think it was fair. I thought what does this have to do with singing? - The whole point I started my blog was really not about fashion, it was about shifting the paradigm of women feeling invisible in our society, which really does happen. And I know I went to look for a job when I was 58 and I experienced so much ageism, and I talk to women all the time and women say it starts at 40. Not only is it sad, but it's such a disservice 'cause people now are living to be 90, 96, and so does that mean when you hit 40 you've got 50 more years where you can't dress nicely or sexy or whatever your style is? That's crazy, and so that was why I started my blog. It was not just about fashion, it was about women who are experiencing that in the workplace, just in society in general, because I think a lot of younger women dread getting older because they feel they're gonna fall off this cliff at the age of 50 or whatever age it is that they're dreading. And so it's not about dreading your age, it's about embracing every year that you're alive because a lot of us don't get to be old. Transition chimes - Ageism, it is just another summit for us to climb as we attempt to live our lives authentically. More money, more time just to keep up with what has been deemed by society as acceptable and appropriate, and with that how long is too long to dye your hair? 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, how long? - It was decades, decades of doing it, and I stopped, I was 56. I first wanted to do it 2013. I held off letting it go because my dad had Alzheimer's, and dementia, and he knew me with my dark hair down, if I wore my hair down. And if I wore my hair up, even when it was still dark, and then I took it down he'd say, "Hey, when did you get here?" So I felt like he still knows me, he knows who I am. Once he didn't know me, he didn't know I was his daughter anymore, it's a tough disease, and he didn't recognize me, and I thought okay, now I can do this. - I used to color my hair every two weeks to three weeks for years, I did it for years. And then it just got worse and then worse, and then every time I would color my hair, the next day or two I could see just a little bit peeking out from my scalp and it was very frustrating. - I was once again thinking about I had dyed my hair on December 24th and it was like January 7th or something like that, and I was starting to plan my next hair dye and I just was like, "God, this is a pain in the ass." "I've been doing this since I was 28 years old and I'm 51, and why am I putting myself through this?" "Maybe now's the time for me to see what's under there." It just literally was like a bolt of lightning striking me, going, "I think I might be done, I think I wanna try this." - So what was different this time from the first time you tried it that you have stayed the path? That even with the family functions and the family pressures, you have said no, I'm gonna stick with this? - I think I'm just done, I was tired, I was tried of the almost weekly hair dye appointment with myself that I had to do, it was something that I had to plan, it was an expense, and it was just more of a hassle than I guess the personal benefit I felt from getting it done. It wasn't doing it for me anymore and I just had enough. - I don't have the patience to sit at a hairdresser every two weeks. - Because that's what's required, yeah. - To get the roots done, yes. - I dyed it at least 20 years. It was just that I'm tired. I'm tired of coloring it, I'm letting it go. - I really started to have a lot when I was in my early 40s, and that's when I started to color it. - I think that it was in the 40s, in my 40s, that I started dying my hair too. I didn't have as much gray hairs, but I started noticing it and of course my hairdresser noticed it and said, "Oh, maybe you should consider starting to dye your hair." - It got to be where my gray was so white that I was having to go in every three weeks. So by this time, I'm letting her color it and highlight it so it'll look natural and paying a lot of money. - I was more of a rebel. I would hold out until I had two inches outgrowth. I just didn't like sitting in the chair. As I continued on, the gray, I have extremely coarse, curly hair, the gray just wouldn't pick up the color. I never blamed my hairdresser for it. My hair is just hard to color and I'd come home and I'd still see a couple of glints in the mirror and be like, "It's not even dyeing anymore." - I just didn't like going to salons very often. Because of that I said, "This is it, I'm not gonna do this anymore," so I stopped. - I'm tired of doing this, it's goopy, it's nasty, it's messy. (laughs) - I was just tired of seeing my roots and seeing at least four different colors, and I was just tired of getting a massive headache, being nauseous when I would dye my hair. And I just said that's it. - I started to dye it when I was age 40. Well, at 42 I started coloring it. I just kept coloring it every eight weeks, then every six weeks, then it was every four weeks, and it got to the point when I turned 55, I said, "You know what, I just can't do this anymore, "I'm just tired of it." It's every four weeks. You live around the bottle or the hair dye. You can't go to a wedding, you can't go swimming, you can't do anything. You can't even go to the gym because your roots are gonna show. I'm like who cares? Hair color shouldn't define a woman. - [Reporter] Melissa Malbranche isn't bashful about her hair. Silver streaks started at 17, and two years ago at 43, she decided to go au naturale. - It became more of a chore, something that I sort of dreading having to do, and I said enough. (transition chimes) - So aside from the time, the money, the monotony of having to get your roots done every two to three to four weeks depending, there is a hidden danger that some of you are very well aware of and in fact had to stop dyeing your hair because of this. - Recently, someone wrote in saying they were concerned about toxic chemicals in hair dyes and specifically a chemical called paraphenylenediamine, or PPD. PPD is used in permanent hair dyes and other dark colored cosmetics. It is a colorless chemical that becomes pigmented when mixed with an oxidizing agent, usually hydrogen peroxide. Now the Environmental Working Group classifies PPD as an above moderate health hazard mostly for the allergic reactions it can induce. Occasionally PPD causes hives and much more rarely serious anaphylaxis. - [Reporter] Whether you like your hair down or all done up, (women laughing) most of us hope to leave the salon feeling pretty. - I just wanted a cute little stylish haircut. - [Reporter] That was the plan for Patrice Washington, who wanted to look nice for her daughter's birthday. - I wanted to do the jet black 'cause my hair is naturally kind of a light brown. So I just wanted to get the same haircut I've been getting for years. - [Reporter] On the left, the look she was going for. On the right, the one she got. - And I look like a monster, this is... I can't recognize my face, it just looks... Kids are looking at me crazy. I just looked, this is ridiculous, my face is swollen, my scalp is all blistered, my hair is falling out. I just feel like the Elephant Man or something. - [Reporter] Doctors say she had a severe allergic reaction to a common chemical found in hair dye. - PPD. - Paraphenylenediamine is a coloring agent that we can trace back to the Industrial Age when we were using that to color clothing and even furs. - [Reporter] In the last 15 years, Dr. Michael Gross says he has seen between 50 and 60 people with the allergy to PPD. - I had all kind of chemicals in my hair. I'm not sure why this dye, this time. - A person may have had exposure to it once, had no problem, went back and had it again, and had a rip-roaring reaction. - [Reporter] The effects range from an itch to trouble breathing and possibly death. Like many of us, Patrice didn't worry about that when she sat down in the chair, didn't ask to see the fine print. - I had two very severe reactions to hair dye, and it ended up that I ended up in the ER twice. Some women are sensitive... - Yeah, a lot of women are. - To hair dye, but they don't know, so then they all of a sudden have like an autoimmune disease. - Yeah. - Like rheumatoid or lupus and could it be traced back to the fact that they've been dying their hair and they're chemical sensitive? I think it's completely possible because there's a lot of autoimmune diseases that have suddenly arrived in the world, but now all of a sudden they are. So is it our chemicals, is it chemicals we put on our body, is it chemicals that we're eating? As a physician, those are all things that come to my mind. - The thought of putting hair dye on my hair knowing that it would absorb through my scalp, that was not something I was interested in. I wanted to stay away from chemicals, basically. - We were a little concerned because we both had such dark hair, and hearing that dark hair colors were kinda carcinogenic or dangerous for us, we were kinda worried about them sitting on our heads for such long periods of time. - Yeah. - Someone I know personally actually got like a cyst in their scalp from dying their hair all the time. So it can be very dangerous because your skull is right there, so you could get a bone infection, you could get chronic infections that make your hair fall out. - I started having damage to my scalp and peeling and burning and losing hair in certain areas. And I decided that I was done with it. - PPD is one of around 5,000 chemicals found in hair dye products today, and some of these chemicals are reported to be carcinogenic according to the National Cancer Institute. So there are definitely other chemicals to watch out for. - [Reporter] There are a few ways women can embrace their naturally changing shade. You can quit dying your hair cold turkey, start adding highlights or lowlights for a smoother tone transition, begin growing out your color from underneath. - If a client comes to me and they're just starting to think about it, I'm gonna maybe either start putting some lowlights or some highlights to start diffusing the line and start to let the gray grow. I'll just do that on the outer part of the hair while I let the inside grow. So that's one way of doing it. - So I was actually thinking about going gray or going natural. I currently color my hair at home with a all-natural dye from Whole Foods, and at this point I'm just not sure if that's the best look for me. - Well Philomena, it is time to commit. Eva Scrivo and her team are working hard to help. - I now have Philomena in my chair and she wants to grow out her natural gray hair. We're going to add some cool-toned highlights throughout the hair. Her natural emerging gray, we want to integrate into the rest of her hair, and also teach Philomena how to care for her hair. When the hair starts to lose pigment, it can be very coarse. So home care, a beautiful haircut, and a new makeup palette will really do wonders. (audience applauding) - We have Philomena. She was considering embracing her gray but she's a little bit trepidatious about it. This is how she looked before. All right, well Philomena come on down. - So let's bring her out. (upbeat music) (audience applauding) (audience cheering) - Oh, you look so nice, I love it. Here, stand there so we can see you before and after. That looks so, well you're a beautiful woman. - Oh, thank you. (Katie laughs) - She is. - That looks so nice. - Thank you. - And how do you feel about this kind of transitional look? - [Philomena] Liberated. - You do? - Yeah, yeah, it feels good. It feels like I don't have to fuss or worry about how it looks all the time. - And so is her natural gray gonna grow in now? - Yes, and we put just a few... - So does she have to do this a lot more? - No, it's not about doing nothing, it's about doing something different when you have gray hair. So every few months, we'll add a few more gray highlights, start the integration process so that she doesn't have to do her roots every four weeks, we kept her hair long 'cause that's more who she is, and it has lots of layers and shape. But I must warn you, if you're going to go gray, make sure you take really good care of your hair and you learn how to do a blowout, because the smoother, the better. - 'Cause her hair is much coarser. - So we talked about maybe highlighting it or trying to grow it out gradually. She said, "You're just gonna have to cut it off." And I thought fine, I'll cut it off. I've never had short hair before. And it took four months to grow out and my agent said, "We love your hair, keep it short." And that's how I arrived at silver hair. - Listen, I wanted to go cold turkey, which I did go cold turkey for the first part of the book. And then halfway through, I wanted to then understand what it's like to... The underneath stayed really rusty, so I decided to bleach that out and then tone it to match the top. - I just started getting curious. I wonder what my hair looks like. I wonder what my real hair looks like and what would it be like if I didn't have to have that anxiety, oh god, my roots are showing, or it's orange, I have to dye my hair. What would it be like if I just let my hair grow? - I just let the gray come in and then kept cutting it down 'til the gray took over. - So I just let it go. So it grew in and then I had part gray and then part dark, and then I just cut it really short. - [Victoria] Oh, you did the pixie. - I just did the pixie, let it go, cut it short, and let it grow in a little bit. And I've never looked back. - I got tired of fooling with that too, so I just did a buzz cut and let it grow out. - [Anderson] (laughs) Did you really? - Yeah, yeah, I mean I have to have my hair long for the show, but I'd like for it to be short. - [Anderson] You actually did a buzz cut? - Oh, hell yeah. - Actually, at that time when I was letting this stuff come in, my hair was already a short pixie cut. It only took me about two months for my transition because once the short little 1.5 inch hair then grew out and I had a little bit, we just cut it off. So I had this very, very tight, short, maybe inch of gray. - So the grow-out process was awful. At first I thought it was kind of fun because I started wearing so many different hats and so many different styles, but then the gray started growing longer than the hats, so I switched to a wig because in my profession, I just couldn't really have a skunk stripe going down my head. So I switched to a wig and I really had fun with that because I'd never been a redhead, I'd always been a brunette, and the wig was sort of reddish and I really liked it. But then everybody let me know that it just did not look good, and so by the end I was really, 'cause it took me two years. And I'm sick of it, I'm totally done with it. As of today, I'm not doing that anymore. (women cheering) (women applauding) - I'm done with that. - I live! - Don't be telling me what beauty looks like and don't be telling me what pretty looks like. And by the end of it, I was really sick of it and just happy to whip it off my head and be done. - Transition was a challenge at times, 'cause initially you feel like people are looking at you, what is she doing to her hair, why isn't she coloring her roots, and it takes a while for it to look purposeful, and I think that was probably the biggest challenge for me. (spirited music) - I love your hair. - Thank you, I love it too. - So what happened that you decided I'm gonna... - I woke up one day, I turned 75 on April Fool's Day, as you know, and I suddenly thought enough is enough. I mean, there's something very funny, I'm sure there's a million people out there that think I'm crazy, I felt some kind of change, I really did. It was subtle but I think it's all about building up to who are you. My god, about time. And I thought screw it, I'm just gonna see what it looks like. And it looked awful for a while, but now I really love it. (transition cymbals) transition chimes - As if the double standard, the ageism, the chemicals is not enough, a woman has to contend with, quite surprisingly, the negative feedback that she gets from society, and I'm talking about her close friends, her family members, and worst of all complete strangers. - I recently got this comment on my blog. "You look like you are 70 with your gray hairs. "You really should consider dyeing them for TV "so you don't look like such an old hag." "Just a suggestion." I am 31 years old, and I've got a fair amount of gray hair as you can see. Now normally I just share recipes, but today I wanted to take a minute to talk about this comment and address it publicly because this is something I feel strongly about. My husband actually feels very strongly that I shouldn't dye my hair, and his reasoning is that he wants us to grow old together. How cute is that? If you read my About Me page, you'll find that I have a rare autoimmune disease that means that I will most likely never live to be 70 years old. Every sign of aging that I have is a sign that I'm still alive. A lot of people don't get the privilege to ever live to be old, and I probably won't either. Which means that I don't have time to waste criticizing myself, and I don't have time to waste criticizing other people. I care a lot more about what my life is like right now. - Was this up-and-coming salon stylist wonder woman thought it upon herself to come running after me to tell me that she could salvage me and save me from myself, and how she could color my hair and make me less haggard and less old and less wrinkly, and I could be beautiful. Yeah, that's what I thought. It went over really big. For me, personally, I feel if I was to dye my hair, I would have a wrinkly face with dyed hair. Now how is that gonna make me look younger? I sat there and thought you know what Audrey, you're a beautiful person, and if she'd known all the things that I had survived, then she wouldn't be so heartless and cruel. And I said to heck with the little twerp, but it's sad that in today's society, we have to be approached and actually attacked in such a manner. - I had a 10-year relationship that was on again and off again and mostly it was off, but just prior to my going gray, we had decided to really go for it and make more of a relationship, and he told me pretty much every single day that I needed to dye my hair, every day. He was very, very negative and cruelly so, I thought, not kind about it. I don't think a woman needs to hear that she needs to change herself every day in order to be worthy of love. - I have this friend from college that I've kept in contact with for years, and over the years every few times, "If you dyed your hair, you would look- exactly the way you looked when you were in college." One day I told him, I said, "I am not trying to look like I looked in my college days, "I'm trying to look great in the age "and at the years it is at this time." And I said, "I can't go back, I don't wanna go back, "and I'm just embracing myself at this time "with my gray hair, and I love it." - From a previous coworker, female, my age, and she made the comment on Facebook, and she just stated, "I hate that gray hair." - Yeah, someone I knew not really well but she just didn't like it at all. I forget her words but it was something like, "Oh, oh no." - A few years ago I divorced, and a couple of years after my divorce I began dating. And one of the gentlemen that I had gone out with two or three times, he says, "Hey, you have a good look about yourself, "but I think you ought to color your hair. "It makes you look old the way you wear it, "the color of it makes you look old." - You get a lot of flack. I cannot tell you how many people, "Lauren, you're so pretty, you look so great, "you should just cover your gray "'cause it'll make you look younger. - I was humiliated at a hair salon. The hairdresser parted my hair, and so he called everyone over and said, "Look at this hair." He said that he thought it was 50%, and it might have been gray and white, he said, "Look at this," and I was 16, I was very... You wanna not stand out in a negative way, and at that time I didn't have this understanding that I do now about this freedom. - I never dyed my hair. Every single day I would receive negative comments. "You would be so much better, "you'd be so much younger, you'd be so much this," and I just became so rebellious about it it was almost just no way, no way would I do it. - If you see a woman on the street who is growing her hair out and she has four inches of gray on the top of her head and then whatever color down below, you should know that that woman is really fucking strong because it takes a strong woman to do that. That is a lot of pain. Every time she looks in the mirror, she's seeing half of one thing, half of another. She doesn't really feel like she's got much of anything going on. However many inches there are, that's how many months she's been going through that transition and having people in her life say negative things to her. Boy, the grow out is tough and I understand that a lot of women cave during the grow out. - I caved, yes, I caved. My mother does not like it. My son does not like it. My brother does not like it. So it was a lot of negativity and just, I caved to pressure. - I did have one lady in the book who did go back and that was because she was shamed by her regular hairdresser, and he told her that she looked like a battleship gray. And other than that, she really liked it but it was the terminology used around the color she had. And she said she immediately dyed it back. - Many times, I changed my mind because of the people that were around me and were asking me to color my hair because I look younger and I'll feel better. - I remember talking to a male friend and he mentioned that gray hair would make a person look dirty I don't want people to think that I'm dirty, so I guess I'm gonna have to dye my hair again. (laughs) - I was in an interview for an adjunct professor position. The man opposite me said, "Oh, you must be in your mid-30s." And I said, "No, I'm 26." And he said, looking sort of horrified, "Oh, you're 26? "But I can see your roots, "so I assumed you were in your 30s." Okay, this did not sit well with me, so I immediately started dying my hair, and I'd been dying my hair from 26 to 50. - I was with my cousin and we were out and someone asked me was I her mother. And I caved that day. - Gray hair in my culture symbolizes old age. Your youth is gone. Who's going to marry you? Especially in my culture, you have to look young, you have to look beautiful, you have to have jet black hair for your husband-to-be in the future. - When I moved into Laguna Beach, I met a friend and she told me that no one would really wanna date me if I had silver hair, unless they were kind of a granola person and that would be fine if that's what I was okay with. - It brings me back to my family, who think I was gonna just look old and no one was gonna wanna date me because I had gray hair. And I did worry about that. I have gotten divorced, not because of the gray, but when I was with him and prior to stopping the dye, whenever it would grow in, he would call me stripe because I would have a stripe of gray. So that always stuck with me like hmm. But then becoming single and worrying what guys were gonna think about the gray hair, you know you kinda question it, you do gotta wonder, but then again if someone is not gonna accept me for who I am and what color my hair is regardless if it's gray or brown or pink or purple, then he's probably not the one for me anyway. (transition chimes) - So many women think that if they embrace their gorgeous grays, if they allow their natural silver, white, gray hair to come through, that they are going to have a difficult time dating. And while that may sound reasonable, the reality is, and this is based on a comprehensive social experiment which you're about to see, the reality is that it is quite the opposite. (audience clapping) - Well, if you color your hair, you know how costly it can be, especially if you add it up over time. It's like drinking five cappuccinos a day, really. Our guest Anne Kreamer did just that, and can you guess the amount she spent? A staggering $65,000. It's enough to make your hair turn gray even if it isn't gray. And that's just what she did. It's all in her new book, "Going Gray." When you started doing research for the book, it was really more like a social experiment. - It was, I mean, I decided I did a lot of different things. I did surveys where I sort of polled people nationwide, I went out and I talked to women in malls across the country. And trust me, you can talk to them about anything in their lives once you say, "Can we talk about your hair for a few minutes?" And then I interviewed people across the world. - [Martha] Hairdressers? - Hairdressers across the country. I went in to meet with corporate recruiters, image consultants... - Did you go both as dyed hair and as gray hair on Match so you had some sort of way to see... - That's exactly what I did. - You did, okay. - I went on... - [Martha] And where did you get the most response? - With my gray hair. - You did? - Counterintuitively. I went on in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, and in each of those markets, three times as many men were interested in going out with me with my hair gray as they were with my hair brown. - [Martha] Really, three times? - Yeah, three times, it was fabulous. - Most men like it. It shows them that you have a confidence, that you wanna be who you are. That's, I think, the message that men pick up. - Dating or just talking to people in general, I've just never had any problems. I think I do better now than I have years ago, and I think that's a good thing. - I didn't have any problems dating, and I think the reason is because I owned it, I wore it proudly, and I was authentic, and I never had a problem dating, mm-mm girl, mm-mm. Not one bit. (laughs) I had plenty of boyfriends. - Dated a lot of men and nothing ever came of my hair color. I think they liked it, I think they really liked it. And then I met my second husband and he has a full head of white hair now. - Actually, I have a lot of men stop me and tell me how great my hair looks or how much they like my hair. (transition chimes) - So many women become very aware that once they have silver, gray, or white hair that the colors that they used to wear on clothing, jewelry, their makeup, actually has to change. So I had the good fortune of meeting Jill Kirsh. She is a color consultant and she has been featured everywhere. She was named the Best Color Consultant by L.A. Magazine's Best of L.A. issue. She was featured in In Style Magazine, The Los Angeles Times, countless TV programs on NBC, ABC, and I am thrilled that she agreed to be a part of this documentary so that you ladies will know now what colors you should be wearing with your new silver, gray, white hair. - I put together a system for fashion and for beauty that's entirely based on someone's present hair color because what I've learned over the years is that your hair frames your face. It frames your eyes and your smile and you really need to work it to pull everything together. Everyone can wear most every color. It just depends on the shade of that color. And for the gray, for the salt and pepper, for silver, it's very different than for basically any other hair color. You wanna see all your colors? - I would love to see all my colors, yes, yes. - Do you wanna see all her colors? - Okay. - Let's see it. - These are your colors. So I'm gonna take you through this. Every single shade in here is great with salt and pepper hair, silver hair, okay, everything in here works really well. Grays are fabulous, grays, black totally, all of these, yellow, but a really clear, true yellow, orange, these are very stark, clear colors. The red is a true red, it's not too orange-y, it's not too blue. And pink... - Now how am I gonna remember all of these colors that I can wear? - Oh, you don't remember, you just remember. - (laughs) I don't have a photographic memory. - Okay, so this is what I've done to make it so simple. I've put together this swatch book. This is like the keys to the kingdom, this is everything. My clients don't go shopping without this. - It's the perfect size. - Look at this, it's like a wallet size, it takes every single shade of these colors and you take it with you to go shopping and you go up to the item in the store and you go, "Okay, is this this color?" See, she would never buy this color every anymore, right? 'Cause it's not in her swatch book, okay? So the other thing that's really cool about the swatch book is that not only are all of these your colors, but you can mix and match and layer and this and it's awesome and it works all the time. And this goes from... - This is makeup that goes with it as well? - [Jill] It is. - [Victoria] This is gonna tell me what colors I can wear now? - Yes, it's gonna give you every shade. - I knew they had to be different because, yeah, okay, cool, I'm very excited. - Very different, enough said, enough said. (laughs) Yeah, so here's something I wanna share with everyone. Okay, for your base, for your foundation, it's all about the skin tone. You wanna get something fabulous that blends into your jawline, your favorite manufacturer, whatever, okay? But for the eyes, cheeks, and lips, it is all about your hair color. And so what I did was I designed these makeup kits for the eyes, cheeks, and lips. Every shade of every color is gonna work for you. Even if I hold it up to your face, it's fabulous. And they all blend with each other. It's fabulous, it's great, it's really great. There's a lip gloss, there are three different shades of lipstick because it's the same thing with the colors. It's not like you get one blue and one green, you get a bunch of shades, but shades that all complement your hair color, okay? - That's beautiful. - Well, the makeup kit is all derived from the swatches so the seams comes from the swatches, to the makeup, to your hair, you see? - That's a no-brainer. - So everything all works together and what you have works so hard to get to with transitioning and now you have this fabulous head of hair, how do you work it, what do you do to make it soar, make it amazing? And that's what I've done, that's what I've done. - You've saved us so much time and money going to the store, trying out different colors, seeing if they'll work now. This is all in one, it's a godsend, it really is. - Yeah, it's great. - And I love these lipsticks. - It's all mineral-based, parabens-free lipstick. It's a really clean product. - Well, very few women have the beautiful gray hair that you have. I mean, my hair isn't naturally this color and I choose to dye it. - I've had a lot of women say, "Oh, well if my hair looked as good as yours "then I would do it." I said, "But how would you know if you don't grow it out?" You're not gonna know. And anyway, all different shades of gray, it's beautiful. So why not just let it go? - It's like, "Oh, I love your silver hair "but that's not good for me. "Mine would never do that." You're only seeing a tiny bit. Of course it's not gonna look good. You got to give it some time to splay open so we can really see it in its entirety. - Everybody that now, work or church or something, they say to me, "Your hair is beautiful. "If I could go that color, I would." Like, "Oh my god, it's so great you're doing this, "I wish I had the guts to do this." If I had a nickel for every time I heard that from somebody. - A lot of women still come up to me and they're like, "Oh, I love your hair, it's so beautiful, "but I can't do that, it won't look as good on me." - I would like to see my hair grown, and I wanted at first just to see it so that I could look at it in front of me. And when it got this long, then people said, "I think I really like that." So I continued to let it grow and I really enjoyed watching the multiple colors come through, so the race has been how long can I get it? And I can tell you that I have not had this long hair since 1974. - But I think it's also demonstrating that gray is actually color in and of itself. It's not the absence of anything... - It's just a different color. - And I think there's a spectrum, it's just a different color. - So is there a right way to go gray, then? - [Reporter] More and more women are saying goodbye to dye and hello to their natural silver hair color. Celebrities like Jamie Lee Curtis and Helen Mirren were some of the first to go full silver, but young girls like Pink and Lady Gaga have followed suit. (transition rumbles) (chiming music) - The trend, I find it fascinating. I think the young Osbourne girl was one of the ones I remember was wearing it very well. She also had in colors of plum and the way she designed her hair, it was always very attractive. Lady Gaga, I think she's done a great way of showing and sharing with people how that hair will look - I find it quite flattering that they want to look like us, those of us who are naturally gray. But on the other hand, very damaging to their hair and it's a lot of upkeep and expense. - All right Susie, we're ready for you. - [Reporter] Susie Katz can't wait to go gray. In fact, she's "dyeing" to. - [Marie] Okay here we go, there's no turning back now. - [Reporter] The 29-year-old is one of a growing number of young women and men who are asking professionals like Marie Robinson to color their locks various shades of gray. - How often are you doing this in your salon? - I would say that we're averaging probably three to four clients a week, which I think is a lot for something that's such an unusual and unique look. - [Reporter] 24-year-old Jean Salvador has been gray for the past four months. - I come back to do this about once a month. - [Reporter] Colorist Lucille Javier must bleach the hair to a pale yellow then apply the gray tint. - The transformation process is about an eight to nine hour job. - [Reporter] The average cost is about $700, but that can vary depending on your hair and the salon. After an entire day in the chair, Susie loves her new look. - I feel like a super chic older lady. - I think what it actually says is that they have seen enough of us women with natural silver hair that look good and healthy and happy and confident that they think oh wow, I wanna try that. - Some of them look good if they wanna spend the money, but I think they should wait 'til they earn it. - Well, women and men who are naturally going gray, they're embracing it more because of this trend. One of the colorists that I spoke to, Marie Robinson, she said that older people are noticing this trend in younger women and really embracing it 'cause it can be quite beautiful. Because it's a lighter shade, they say that gray is the new blonde. It sort of has a brightening, softening effect on a lot of people. - A lot of people think that I am having it done, and they are very, very surprised when I tell them that it's my hair. And they're like "No, it's not." Yes, it's my hair. And at that point, I think I feel a little bit of pride that I can have someone think that it's professionally done when it's just me. (laughs) - She was complimenting me on my hair and thought I had it done. - I get stopped out on the streets, department stores, coffee houses. They're always asking me, "What color did you put in your hair? "Oh, that's such a great cut." I'm like, okay, do you really wanna know the truth? The truth is there's no color. (laughs) It's my natural. - My hair was up and just the beginning was white and people would ask me, "How did you get that, how did you do that? "Who's your hairdresser? "How do I get that look?" And I said, "Well, nature. "I just let it grow." - I was recently in my cousin's wedding and I got this really wild hairstyle and I got so many compliments 'cause they're like, "Is that real? (Victoria laughs) "Did you do that just for the wedding?" 'Cause the accents to the dresses were all silver. So they were like, "Did you get that done professionally?" I'm like, "Well, the hairstyle yes, "but the hair is au naturel." - I realized this is who I am. I wish I had done it back in my 30s when I first noticed it, quite honestly. - The only regret is I didn't do it sooner. I wish that I had. - But I feel great now and it's something that I wish I had done sooner. - I wanna make this for my granddaughters. I have a three year old and I have a five year old, and also for my grandsons, because they're ten and six and I don't want them to think a woman is defined by the color of her hair, she's not beautiful because she's older and she has gray hair. I want them to realize women are beautiful no matter what age they are, and I want my granddaughters to realize when they see that first strand of silver hair, it's not the end, it's only the beginning of such a beautiful journey. It's what you make of it and you can't let the outside world or society or even Hollywood determine whether you're good enough because you have gray hair. Gray hair is a given and I wear this like a badge of honor. I am so blessed to be here and I'm proud and I've earned the right to walk around and be proud that I have my gray hair. - A 12 or 13-year-old girl, she actually came up to me and told me that she liked my hair, so I was like, "That's really sweet of you." So I always appreciate when a young person likes my hair because it's always nice. - My 13-year-old has gotten her first strand and she's very excited about it. She's looking forward to it. My 16-year-old doesn't have any, and my 28-year-old, she is getting hers come in, and she calls them her little glitter streaks on her hair. (laughs) - Now that I have embraced my natural look, I would love to be able to be part of empowering young women to just accept themselves the way they are, to kind of resist the culture that we must do all these things to create kind of a false sense of who we are. (transition chimes) - Okay my lovelies, now the fun begins. You have gone through the transition and you have weathered the storms, so to speak, and now you are getting more compliments than you have ever received in your entire life about your hair, and it's rather interesting because all of the heartache that we went through to get to the point of being fully transitioned is met with such applause and such adulation and admiration, it's amazing that anyone would have anything negative to say ever about it once you are fully transitioned, as you will see. - When you do embrace it, there's something that feels really good about that. You know... There's something that just feels good, like you're being real, you're being authentic. - This has made me feel very powerful and I can do anything. - I really felt powerful because I was making a choice and kind of going against the grain because people don't really like you to go against the grain, right? - My hair says I'm powerful, original, and independent. - The next day I went to my hairstylist and I told him I want it all chopped off. And when I took my first look in the mirror, for me, it was one of the most freeing experiences to just be me, it was great. - For me, cutting my hair short makes me feel free, and going gray, especially all of the ones we did all day say the keyword is freedom. - Freedom. They're like, "Freedom!" - Don't listen to other people. If it's what you want, just do it. - I wanna be who I am, I wanna be real, I wanna be genuine, I wanna be authentic, and I wanna be free! - It just makes me feel free and freer for something that I don't have to deal with every few weeks. - And I wanted the freedom, and that's what I have now. I feel very free to be myself with my hair as-is. - I went through my phases of purple hair and blonde, brunette, redhead, you name it. But honestly, none of them felt like me the way that this does. - So for me, it's about reinvention, it's about authenticity. - This is not about them, this is about me and I've never been happier. - It is an amazing journey in itself, and it's liberating, that's my word for that. It is so liberating not to have any products or chemicals on my head and I don't know where else they go. - I have loved every minute of not dyeing my hair in the past 14 weeks. I have felt liberated like I can't even begin to tell you. My mind doesn't even think about, oh, maybe I need to dye my hair, or I'm going to this social occasion, how far in will I be in my dye job, will my roots be showing? I mean all of that is... - [Victoria] Which is everything you thought about before. - Yeah, totally, and it's poof, gone. Not having to give that a thought is fan-fucking-tastic. - [Victoria] (laughs) I love it. - It is awesome, and I mean that alone gives me life that I'm like, I can make it through this. - [Victoria] Right. - I've always caved in to the general consensus, what you should do, what you shouldn't do, and I'm feeling a lot freer now. - Like today, I'm coming here today and I have to tell you, I would've thought about, well, when am I gonna color my hair, is it gonna last by the time I get here, is it gonna peek through? Because my hair grows really fast. So I would have to think about all of that stress, but I didn't have to think about any of that, which was awesome and I loved it. - [Reporter] 51-year-old Dana Guerrero wanted to follow the silver movement and came to Massey for help. - It'll definitely take a little while for me to get used to it, I'm anticipating that because I think it'll be a little radical today. But I'm open to the experience. - [Reporter] After a few hours in the chair, Dana is ready to see her transformation. - Dana? - Yes? - Are you ready? - I'm ready. - I'm gonna turn you around. - Okay. - Okay? - Oh holy, oh my gosh. - (laughs) No swearing. - I know! (laughs) Oh my goodness. - Honestly. - I don't even know who this is. I don't know what to think. I mean, it's beautiful, I love it. It's such a change that I can't speak now. I mean, I never am at a loss for words. - [Reporter] Would you do it again if you had to? - Oh, totally. There's something real deep going on here. Yeah. It's like a, I don't know? (empowering music) Gray Is The New Blonde means to me joy, effervescence, power, life, energy, and an upward trajectory 'til we dive off into infinity. - I have an inner confidence right now and I'm not even fully gray yet. I mean, 'cause this takes strength. To walk through life like this right now, you need to be a badass and that's how I feel. - It is a movement, it's a declaration of a stage, not an age. It moves me to be a part of this beautiful, beautiful time of life where women are just standing up for who they are, and who knew that it would start with our hair? - Don't allow anyone to ever make you feel terrible about yourself, ever, ever, ever, because you are enough, it's true, you are enough. - I love the fact that there's this stuff growing right out of your head that just shouts to the world, "I am the only one like this. "There is nobody else like me." And I think that's wonderful. - I remember the first I was in Downtown Houston on the steps, and this particular guy said, "That's God's glory." And I turned around and looked, I said, "Sir, what?" And he said, "You ma'am, that beautiful hair of yours, "that beautiful gray and silver hair of yours, "that's God's glory," and he said, "Just makes you shine." - Gray used to represent giving up or aging, not being interested in anything current, but now it's more of an act of rebellion. - What happens to you while you're going through your transition is you discover really who you are and what you wanna be. - I think that it's about owning our inner power and not letting other people or media tell us who we have to look like or what we have to be like. - Now is the perfect time to be who you are, be gray, just do whatever you wanna do, look the way you wanna look. - The way things are going now where more women are growing their hair out, I think that's quite a statement about our times. I think it's amazing. - I had a young man once tell me I looked like a superhero to him because of my hair. - Every single silver-haired woman is going to have a different color of gray and silver. No two will ever be the same. It is you, your individual you. And the problem with when you color your hair, 50,000 other people are using that product, number 118 or whatever the color you choose, and every single one of you have the same hair color. There is no individuality there. - And I'm happy where I am now, and almost wish it was even grayer than it is. - Silver gray is beautiful, and for all of y'all that are thinking, oh, how are people gonna view me, what's more important is how do you feel? How do you view yourself? And just if you feel good, then yeah, you're gonna project that and that's how everyone is going to see you and you're gonna get positive feedback. - It's a whole new me with a whole new empowered outlook. - Most of the time I would think of my grandparents when I saw gray hair, but the truth was it was just an ideology of most of us thinking only grandparents have gray hair. Many, many young people have gray hair. - Once I got past I guess the challenging part where it was probably halfway grown out, I just embraced it and that's kinda how I feel about it. I was just gonna embrace it and hold my head high. - I think it's amazing, I think it's liberating, I think it's about time there was a focus on the forgotten woman. - 'Cause I need to be the real me, and so now I feel very settled in it. I have been silver for a solid six years now and have no plans of even putting a bit of color in it. - You can go out in the sunlight with a mirror and look at your gray hair, your natural gray hair, and see how shiny it is. But if it's either dyed or bleached or whatever, when you compare that, there's not as much shine. - A lot of young people are dyeing their hair to be gray or silver or some kind of tone of gray, and it's worked out in my benefit because people look at me and they think, oh, she's on trend, right? She's hip, she's fashionable. But really I was born this way. (laughs) (Victoria laughing) I didn't have to pay any extra money for this. - And I dedicate this film to all my gorgeous gray girlfriends around the world. ♪ We're going up straight to the top ♪ ♪ We're gonna work it over to the top ♪ ♪ We're going up straight to the top ♪ ♪ We're going up straight to the top ♪ ♪ We're going up straight to the, to the top ♪ ♪ Going up straight to the top ♪ ♪ We're going up straight to the top ♪ ♪ We're going up straight to the top ♪ ♪ We're going up straight to the top ♪ ♪ We're gonna work our way to the top ♪ ♪ We're going up straight to the top ♪ ♪ We're going up straight to the top ♪ ♪ We're going up straight to the top ♪ ♪ We're gonna work our way to the top ♪ ♪ We're going up straight to the top ♪ ♪ We're going dancing on the top of the world ♪
