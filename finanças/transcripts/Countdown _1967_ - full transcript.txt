'Apollo 3, Houston. Do you read?' Apollo 3, Houston. Do you read? 'Roger, Houston. Apollo 3.' 'Apollo 3, all systems are go down here, gentlemen.' 'Lee, do you read?' We read you, CAPCOM. You talk too much. - We're all go up here, too. - 'Roger.' Third orbit coming up at 0-2-4-5-2-2. I want a short status report, Rick. Take the third orbit. 'Apollo 3, Houston. Lee?' Yeah. Yeah, Apollo 3. 'There's a hold on your next orbit. Stand by to copy.' Hey.. Hey, Houston. Come on, we gotta go up here for the first 17 orbits. 'Gotta hold, sorry.' Ask for another orbit. Then we can-- Making on-board decision on this. We are still go. 'Relay protest. Stand by to copy.' Hell, no! Apollo 3, this is Ross. 'Ross, I've got a good orbit.' 'Why don't you check your lights down there' 'for malfunction?' I know all about your mission, uh, Pilgrim. - Scrub it. - Say again. 'Yes, Chiz. You heard it right. Abort the mission.' U-um, g-give it a chance. I'll make, I'll-I'll make another check. Come on. I mean, that's why they got us up here instead of computers. 'This mission is my responsibility.' Get your helmet on and get back on the couch. - You got a red there. - 'Okay, go ahead.' ...crackin' out and it's a phony. We are aborting now. Roger. Lee's heartbeat jumped 20 beats. - How's Chiz? - Up, too, but not as much. Rick unchanged. What's this all about? Uh, I want you to skip Chiz's medical, Gus. I wanna get to him as quickly as possible. Nine, eight, seven six, five, four 'three, two, one.' 'SPS thrust on.' Roger. Got a firing. 'Good here, Apollo 3.' All out. What the hell is the idea with the sun so bright? You ever take a 1000 watt candle that's what you're gonna get up there. Lee. Uh, Rick. - That couch still isn't right. - Rick. Hell, I'm breaking my back in there. Why did they torpedo this thing? - I don't know I'm just - the doctor. - Hi. - Jose's here, too. Hop in the back seat. Put the towel on you, huh. What went wrong? I don't know what the hell it was. Chiz knows. Come on, break it up. Break it up! Hey, Lee! Stop by at the house after dinner. We have to meet. Will you? Hello, Mickey. How you doing, Stevie? Hi. - What was it all about? - I don't know. Oh, I, I like Terry, you know. Chiz, bring the water! I don't know. She's so...intense. Thank you. It's like, and this is true, you go over there 'and the first thing you know she's got a little niche' 'for your toothbrush, that kind of thing.' 'And I'm thinking, what's happening?' Hello, hello, hello. Mr. Cute Personality. Thank you. Name it. Uh, tequila. Hey, Lee, let's go! Okay. Uh, the secret word was Pilgrim. I, I figured that out. What's the deal, Chiz? We're gonna send a man to the Moon. - You're kidding? - Hey, man. One man all the way. It's called Pilgrim. 'They started it three years ago' 'as an emergency backup to Apollo.' Um, the word that lingers there somewhat is "Emergency." By 4 a.m. tonight, the Russians will have a one-man mission circling the Moon. We expect them to put a three- man Voskhod up there to land 'in the next lunar cycle, three to four weeks.' 'We'll be ready in three.' 'That's, uh, shavin' it kinda thin, isn't it?' 'Keep it quiet long enough, we'll get a jump off.' That's why so few people have been cut in. Thanks, lady. - You want more? - No, thanks, honey. So you're the Moon-man, is that it? 'Yeah, going to the Moon.' That's why they scrubbed us today to get me back and into pre-flight. Do I hear "Congratulations?" Oh, sure. I think that's great, Chiz. I-I'd like to hear how you're gonna do it. On an uprated Saturn, with a new third stage and a new landing stage for one man twice the space, twice the life support. - What gets you back? - 'You do.' I stay up there till you come to ferry me home in Apollo. Ten months, a year ...eight months. A Gemini landing cannot work without an atmosphere and a body of water-- You know what it is? You know what it is? It's a 240,000 mile dive into a dry pool. Oxygen-hydrogen retro system. - 'It'll hover like a cat.' - And then what do you do? You live off the land with a bow and arrow? Hell, Chiz-- 'Once you get up there, you get in a shelter, you're set.' Well, you can quit saying "You" 'cause I'm not going anywhere. Alright, now listen. A week before Pilgrim goes, we send up a shelter stock with food, oxygen, all life-support systems on the same type of bird. Everything's in here. 'There's systems, communications' trajectories and Dunc is my backup. Now, the shelter has a flashing beacon and a radar signal. And Surveyor will probably spot it, too. 'Now, if I don't locate it with all that' I complete a figure-eight around the Moon, swing back and re-enter behind the beefed up heat shield. Now, three days later I'm getting stoned on a kerry while the band plays. You've started up an LSD research team? You haven't even asked the good questions yet and all the answers are in here. You'll wanna read it. The path of the Voskhod as indicated and confirmed by the Jodrell Bank Observatory in England indicates that the original estimates are probably correct that this will be a lunar orbiting mission and not a lunar landing. The Russian government has still made no announcement concerning the Voskhod flight. Our own tracking network is locked on to the Russian space vehicle and reports as to its position are being released. 'However, no official announcement has been made.' 'This is Clete Roberts at the Cape.' Phew! I really feel sorry for Jean. Hmm? I said I really feel sorry for Jean. I just put myself in her position. Phew! One year. What if it were you? Me? Same. I think I'll give her a call tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah, she is a tough babe. Sure. I mean, we're all tough. Ross, good to see you. Dr. Ehrman. Come right this way. Mr. Croyden, I believe you know Ross Duellan. - How are you, sir? - This is Dr. Ehrman. - It's a great pleasure. - Gentlemen. Shall we go right in? The Russian's name is Alexis Plekhanov. - He's a geologist. - That's unproved. He's had no military training.. And no one knows that for sure. Thirty-four, specialist in lunar terrain. He wasn't before, he is now. A civilian, Mr. Duellan, that's the operative word. We expect their three-man shop to be all civilian. All beside the point. There is no time to train a new man and the two men we have trained have military titles. Well, if it's that flat, we oppose it. You're wasting your-- You won't accomplish anything this way. If your men had started consulting State on these projects, we, uh we could have told you just when it was initiated. Have you no civilian somewhere in the-- He has to be in a capsule and ready to go in three weeks. So we chose our best, most experienced Gemini astronaut. Now, he just happens to hold a commission in the Air Force but he is employed by us and we are definitely a civilian-- But he is still in the Air Force. - Now, what are we discussing? - Dr. Ehrman. They have just sent a scientist. They are going to send three scientists. We cannot send a colonel, an Air Force colonel. Nor can we send a man who is inadequately trained. - Must he be inadequate-- - I'd rather take my chances. The State Department can't stop us. Now, Chiz, Colonel Stewart has trained a year and a half he knows the mission and the equipment. He's ready. - 'I chose him.' - Yeah, sit down. I'll put the man up there. You worry about the public relations. The public relations is everybody's problem. What sustained your program? Public relations, public acceptance, public revenue. And your programs, whatever they are. 'We feel very strongly' 'that even a technical military connection' could be used against us. Unfair, yes. But there were two or three men in the Gemini training program who were not in any military status. We prefer that one of them one who could be brought up to qualification. Alright, Mr. Nogrady, I think it's quite clear. 'You're saying, to come up with a civilian' or the program is jeopardized. - Is that correct? - Consider it. The cost is enormous in money. There is risk of life. That should justify that, Mr. Duellan. Let us make more points, accomplish as much as possible. 'Our space program is non-military.' 'We can demonstrate that.' Three weeks. Some civilian.. '...who could be trained.' What are you doing here? - Just checking. - Anything new? They say it's gonna orbit the Earth once before re-entry. Might be visible. I was down here around 3 a.m. just to make sure he swung around the moon. - Afraid he might land? - Yeah. - Did you read the manual? - Excuse me, gentlemen. MSFN says the Russian has re-entered somewhere in Siberia. - Well? - Huh? The manual? Uh, Pilgrim's possible but so is digging at the Grand Canyon with a teaspoon. Hey, you'll be at Gus' party? For a while. My schedule's changed. Lee. I wanna talk to you. I thought you were in Washington. 'Mick.' - Lee? - 'Yeah.' Why are you home so early? Uh, well, I, uh, sprung myself. Oh. Well, you're just in time to help me zip my dress. See, I can't reach it. Uh, where are you going? Oh, Blair thought she'd get something organized today. 'So Jean and Mary and I are gonna drive into Houston' 'just scrounge around.' 'Thought I'd let Stevie have lunch at, uh, Billy Tass's.' Who's Billy Tass? He's just a boy in Stevie's age group at camp. You, uh, speak to Jean? - How does she sound? - 'Fine.' She mention that Pilgrim thing? I knew it. - I just knew it. - What? They, uh.. ...want me to go. Mick? Why did I know that? Well, look, uh, Chiz, Chiz couldn't go. They wouldn't let him. - What did you tell 'em? - I didn't. I know what you told 'em. You told 'em you'd think it over. And I know what you're gonna tell 'em later-- Don't tell me what I told them. Excuse me. What did you tell them? Um, I-I-I listened. I didn't say anything. When you're afraid of something, it happens. The mere fact that you're afraid of it makes it happen. Mick, there are no commitments. I know. Yeah. The Russians are using civilians. 'So the White House felt that for the first one anyway' 'we should use a civilian.' - You're safe? - Um, yes. I'm-I'm safe. Look, I-I've studied this thing and, uh and, uh, they can put that thing up there, that much will work. The rest, I-I don't know. But do you think it's worth a try? Well, I haven't decided yet, Mick! Well, I should be the one to fly it, damn it. - Why didn't you tell 'em? - The reasoning behind-- That's easy, they let the Eskimos and the Moroccans they think I'm up there building a cobalt bomb. Now, a civilian wouldn't do it. He might invent one, but he wouldn't use it. Why not just send the voice of America up there and do it right or send some babe with big beautiful teeth and a stack of pop tunes? I know the machine, I know the mission, I know my skills. I know the bird. Now, who should I talk to? Who really calls the shots, the White House or the Russians? Because they're sending some damn geologist! Uh, Stegler is the only other logical choice. Lee wouldn't do it. He knows it's mine, he knows what it means to me. - And he doesn't like the odds. - Excuse me, Colonel Stewart. - Uh, Mr. Duellan. - As a friend. He thought it over. He's been asked. I just heard from him. Betty, let me get back to you.

The one thing I do understand I understand why you stinking bureaucrats pull that top secret stuff is because you're afraid the doc is gonna say no, right? That's what I mean. That's what I mean. - Gus. - What? You see Chiz around anywhere? Not since Ross pulled him out of his medical. Hey, hey, hey, you called me a stinking bureaucrat. Let me tell you something.

It was either go along with 'em or Pilgrim would be called. - 'They made that very clear.' - 'It's clear.' I told them what my doubts would be. I told them I'd probably chicken out the second things didn't look right. I told them you should do it. Well, that's all the explanation I owe you. - Quit. - No, I won't do that. Quit. They'll give it back to me. Be my...be my backup, Chiz. I need you very badly for that. You're the specialist on Pilgrim, I know that. I kinda want you for my backup. That I can't do. Good luck. I can't be your backup. You'll just have to forgive me about that. Hey, Chiz. Chiz. Let Rick back you up. We don't have any time to recruit. - Rick won't buy it. - Okay, then stay with Dunc. 'It looks like a toy next to Apollo.' - 'What?' - 'A toy.' It's no toy. Strike out last night, Lee. I wanna be backup. You're not gonna make it. You don't have a prayer. You've too much to learn in no time. Yeah, it's been a long time. The pressure suit, it will be clumsy. Now it's easy. Left hand on the hatch, left foot through. Swing your butt and glide in. Ease down. 'You'll have to wear that capsule' 'like you wear your own skin.' 'Your reflexes can't assimilate that fast.' You have to learn the systems well enough to know them when you can't remember your own name. You won't. When you find out how much you don't know we'll see how bad you wanna go. I'll be right on your tail. I'll scrub you. Look, when it comes to the point where I figure I can't make it I'll get out so fast it'll blind you. This'll be hard enough at best, Lee. Stay with Dunc. - Let him pick. - Alright, Chiz. It's up to him. He picks. And when it cracks if you don't scrub him I'll go over your head. Okay, friend. I wanna set up your new training schedule right away. - It's been set up. - It was. We're gonna have to double our efforts now, you understand? Okay, teach, anything you say. 'We're flying to St. Louis in an hour.' 'I wanna get you in that training camp.' Now, our target area is in Oceanus Procellarum the Sea of Storms. We're still receiving signals from our Six Surveyor we'll home in on that. There is evidence the Russians are also using that Surveyor as a navigational beacon. How do you like that, taxpayers? Now, xix days before Pilgrim launch six days and fourteen hours.. ...the shelter capsule will be launched from the Cape. Now, the astronaut will be approaching the moon just before lunar sunrise. That's to give him the best chance of sighting the shelter beacon. If he fails to sight the shelter.. ...he merely orbits the moon comes back into the gravitational influence of the Earth and it brings him back. If he lands.. ...he activates the shelter. It contains micro meteoroid protection. Now, inside the shelter are the life-support systems to maintain the astronaut for two months. Additional supplies will be shot to him periodically using the same type cryogenic landing stage. For how long? Uh, until Apollo's lunar landing is ready perhaps ten months, perhaps a year. You want him to make a manual landing after a three-day trip? - Gus-- - Yes? How you gonna have your man weightless for three days? He'll be soaking wet. He'll have bilateral conjunctivitis from oxygen bathing his eyes and you want him to find this beacon? 'All of a sudden he turns on the brakes' he gets slammed in the chest with twice his Earth weight. Don't you boys check these programs out 'with aeromedical?' Biomedical and aeromedical experts have been in on the planning from the beginning. Why not the flight sergeant? I didn't see it. Who's the astronaut? Chiz? He was. Lee Stegler is the Pilgrim astronaut. No, you'll not, Gus. You'll take it and you'll make no noise. I'll tell you why, you hold the naval commission-- I also happen to have a medical degree. Excuse me, Dr. Scavo. Mr. Nogrady called-- I'm not talking to.. Get these down to Dr. Ehrman right away. - But he's gonna-- - I'll get back to him later. Hey, listen, Ross. Oh, Gus, cut it out, will you? - Betty. - 'Yes, sir.' - 'When did Nogrady call?' - 'He called 20 minutes ago.' Ross, I'd.. Well, if he calls back, hold him off. I've gotta talk to Walter Larson right away. Get him. Will you listen to me for just one minute? Now, I'm a doctor, Ross and you're asking me to help feed this boy into a sausage machine and tell him that it doesn't hurt. - Now, I cannot do that. - Gus, I know it's got risks. I just want the chance to talk to the people in Washington-- No, Gus, no. Now, I've had enough threats-- I-I'm gonna tell you something. I don't give a damn about your problems! I'm thinking about Lee, I just want a chance to talk to these-- Well, no, you won't talk to anyone! And you won't go over my head, by God. And listen carefully, Gus. Now, I've got a job to do here and I'm gonna do that job with or without you. Now, if you want to stay in this program, Gus you'll stop fighting us and do your job. Now, keep your opinions private. Open your mouth to do anything but eat and I'll see to it that you're court-martialed. Yes, what is it? 'Mr. Larson isn't in his office.' Well, damn it, find him! Now, if you feel that you can't work with us then I'll relieve you of the responsibility. You'll relieve me of responsibility? How you go about that, move a pin on your T.O. chart write a special order? 'How you go about it, Ross?' How do you relieve me? Lee's my friend. How do you relieve me of that? Stop making friends. - Hi, Chiz. - Good to see you. - Hi, Gus! - How are you? - Hello, Lee. - Hey, uh.. Chiz, tell him how I did, huh? When you get used to those auugs you can land him on whipped cream and not make a mark. Ha. - Tell him how I did, Chiz. - You did fine. Uh, Ross wanted to give these schedules of the training devices to you. Listen, I-I had an idea. Rather than coming back and forth here all the time I'm just gonna put a trailer out here so that I can stay in there and wait for you and I can cook breakfast and coffee and everything. And everything? You know, that thing is small, but it functions beautifully. You know, I'm getting, getting the feel of it. It, it's very much like a good woman. Just like you. It was a little rough at first but after you get used to it.. I'm-I'm, I'm real happy with it. The, the capsule, real secure. I can tell. I guess you're not too happy, huh? If you're happy, I'm happy. Just don't get too happy, huh? Well, look, we made a bargain, a promise that if anything doesn't look right to me, I'd get out. Right? I love you. I-I mean, that, that was the deal, alright. When it doesn't look right, I, I get out. - Right. - Well.. Look, you say hello to Stevie for me, give him a little kiss. I will. Take care. Gus, you, uh, checked the shelter and the chamber? - What's the matter? Come on, get in. He's hooked up now. Safety's in the primary airlock. Roger. Attention, all stations. This is Pilgrim shelter activation test A9-35. On my mark, begin surveillance cameras. Mark. Okay, Lee. 'Now, Lee, your first big problem' 'when you land up there is to find this thing.' 'Your survival shelter.' 'Now, look up at the top.' 'That's your rotating beacon.' 'That's what you're gonna have to home in on.' 'Remember it good.' How's he doing? Give us a reading, Gus. Temperature about 250 below. Chamber pressure down to ten to the minus eight. He's got two hours of oxygen in the bio-pack. Take it easy, friend, you're gonna have a long time in that shelter. 'What's he doing?' 'Every time he gets that Peter Pan ring on' he thinks he can fly. 'I misjudged..' 'Don't abort this thing yet, I can get back.' This is no game. Stand by, Lee. I can have help in a minute. Alert medical. No, I want him to get out of this fix himself. Get some help in that airlock. Leave him alone. He'll be alone up there. Body heat rate increasing. Heart rate 120. Damn, he must have got it caught on that ladder. Suit's loosing pressure, down to 3.5 PSIA. Fact, he's not making it up. Lee, get on the emergency supplier pack. Drop him off that rig, can somebody do that? Alright, let's [indistinct] and get some help in there. Release the Peter Pan. - He's in bad trouble. - No, he'll make it. Don't screw up the project, damn it. You've got no project if he is dead. He can live about two minutes on the oxygen that's in his suit. He can make it to the shell, they'll let him go. Get the safety man in the primary airlock to put him on emergency air! Ninety seconds of emergency O2 remains. 'Suit pressure 3.3 PSIA.' I'm running this. Let him work it out. - I'm what? - I said you're vetoed! Get in, air safety. Who'll be there to help him on the moon? Not a soul. Full safety. Problem's cleared. I wouldn't advise letting him in there for three days without my checking him over. He's alright now, Gus. Hi, Jean. Hi. Back early. - Who, Lee and Chiz? - Uh-huh. Weren't they supposed to come back today? Well, not till tonight. Hey, Mickey! Come on in, I'll catch ya. Thank you, Jim. - Hi. - Hi. - Is Lee coming? - Yeah, yeah, they-- Oh, I didn't think they were coming until 8 o'clock tonight. No, well, they made it back. Uh, Jean.. So we're, uh, packing.. What's going on, huh? Mickey, look, I don't like to give advice but I'm gonna give you some right now. Shoot. Get Lee out of this project. Oh, Gus. If Lee says we're going to the moon, we're going to the moon until Lee says we're not going to the Moon, okay? I don't care what Lee says. Lee doesn't understand. - Lee. How'd it go? - Hey. Listen, there are a few things I wanna go over with you. So come over when you can, alright? Lee! - How you been? - Fine, fine. I was ready for you tonight. Stevie's gonna be gone. - Hey, how'd it go? - Uh, uh, real good. A little more head room over the couch would help. - I can hardly sit up. - Yeah. Components are okay uh, placement has to be modified a little bit. Did you bring your suit with you? Huh, no. - What did you do to your leg? - Uh, nothing. What do you mean what did you do with your leg? Well, uh, it just twisted a little bit. Listen, there are some things I wanna go over that checklist. Oh, not now, not a chance. See you later. I don't think he has afraid of being ready in time. Don't tell him, tell Ross. What's the matter with him? Oh, you know, he's a doctor. - Hey, Gusso! - Yeah? - Got a minute? - Barely. - I'll buy you drinks. - What for? I don't have a story for you. Talk to Larson. My friend, McDonnell Aircraft just delivered a modified Gemini capsule to the Cape. I hear it's going on a booster. And the next manned shot is scheduled in two months. They're building a press right now. Oh.. They're putting something in the auditorium. We're sending a guy to the Moon in a Gemini. Been very little static about the Russian swing around. Great deal of silence. Look, I can give you the names of those who've, uh suddenly dropped out of Apollo routine. I can tell you the name of the program. It's Pilgrim. Look, doc, I don't have the whole story but I'm gonna print what I have. I told you, talk to Larson. - Knock off cabin thermostat. - Thermostat out. Pilgrim, stand by for injection and report attitude. Three simulations in two days. Crank in cabin pressure failure uh, giving an erroneous signal. Rick, give him oxidizer level red. Level red. 'Coming in to retro position.' 'Uh, you lousy..' Maneuver controller off. Attitude control direct. 'Event timer stopped.' Hey, what's, uh.. What's with the thermostat? 'Thirty-second mark. Five..' Hey, there's something, there's something with the thermostat. - Four, three, two.. - 'It's not.. Just..' - Wait a minute. - 'One.' - Just wait! - 'Mark.' He punched them late, lost a second. Thermostat control has been lowered. Is it too late for a midcourse correction? No, no, it's correctable. Hey, I don't know what you're throwing at me, CAPCOM. Thermostat is out. Cabin pressure is dropping. - 'Ten, nine..' - I have oxidizer red! I have a signal red! Five, four, three, two.. 'Do not inject!' - Mark. - 'Acknowledge, CAPCOM.' Damn it, acknowledge. Relax, Lee, you're just aborted. He threw everything at me but an electrical fire, and a missile attack. It was nothing he couldn't work out in the translunar phase. You gave me five seconds to judge that oxidizer problem. I had control. Who guaranteed you enough time? - He panicked. - No, I had control. You could've taken a trip to the sun, boy. You could've been sucked in, you're out of it. That was a j.. That was a justified abort. - Damn it, I know that. - I'm not gonna do it, Chiz. Is that what these papers are? He'll either panic or dump the mission. I've proved it. I'm the only one who wants it bad enough to make it. You read these training reports, you will make out he can't. Listen to me for a minute. Now if you hand me an evaluation saying Lee can't cut it I'll pass it on disclaimed and disapproved. And even if I scrubbed him, Chiz they wouldn't put you in his place. Now, listen to me, damn it. We just have to shut it down! It’s not a question here of who's the better man? The only question is whether Lee can fight at all with safety. From what I've seen, he can. Now, Lee's bright, he's agile, he's fast and you've run into that. Lee, I want to hear it from you. 'You say you can do it?' Yes. Ross. Walter, please. In my sleep. Well, you should take him back, Chiz. - I want you to reconsider this. - Ross. This is just a reflection of your own ego. Ross. I don't know how it got out, but it leaked. Oh, damn it. Wait a minute, Chiz. Chiz, wait a minute! - Who figured out this story? - Seidel. Seidel? Seidel is here all the time! Didn't you bring him in and brief him? Close the door and wait a minute will you, Chiz? - 'I brought on the services.' - 'No.' 'And you don't know how it leaked' 'how Seidel got the story?' Two days more and we could've had an unbeatable edge. Well, those men should have been brought in and told and sworn to secrecy. You just can't keep a project this size-- Is your buzzer off? Mr. Nogrady is calling from Washington. That's two days of secrecy we lose. Alright. - Uh, does this change anything? - No. Be prepared to leave for the Cape tomorrow as planned, Lee. The day after tomorrow the shelter goes 'five days later you fly.' Alright. - 'Hey, you want me to leave?' - 'I don't want you to leave.' 'Hello. Close the door, will you?' You couldn't make this mission, Chiz. You got the guts, but you haven't got the brains. Hey, aren't you getting a little old for that mouse around your neck? - Who? Jose? - 'Yeah.' But mom won't buy me a real one. Uh-huh. I see. Right in there. 'Good catch.' 'You know where I'm going, son?' - 'No.' - 'To the Moon.' 'Oh, yeah? Apollo?' 'No, no, something else, something right away.' - 'To the Moon?' - 'All the way.' 'And back?' Well, if everything is alright up there, I'll stay for a while. 'Maybe as long as a year.' - 'Where on the Moon?' - 'The Sea of Storms.' Hey...that's not far from Copernicus. Is it? They wouldn't let me go along. Would they? You'll stay here and take care of your mom. I thought that was supposed to be your job. Yeah, well, now I've elected you. I got you. Walter, there's a rumor they're gonna scrub the mission. Oh, Joe, you know better than that. Please. Please, please.. 'Make way.' 'Come on, boys, will you?' Okay. 'This is the launch of Pilgrim Lunar Shelter.' 'Ten, nine, eight, seven' 'six, five' 'four, three' 'two, one.' 'Ignition.' 'Lift off.' 'This is Pilgrim control test 1-5-0-1.' 'Temperature 82 degrees.' 'Wind five knots southwest.' 'Barometric pressure 29.94.' Jean? - Did you seen Lee around here? - Yeah. They're, around here somewhere. ♪ April in Paris ♪ ♪ Chestnuts in blossom ♪ ♪ In blossom ♪ Uh, Mickey, how do you feel about it?

W-wh-when they-- Six-six hours ago. Come on. Hey, Lee, did you see our Lee Stegler Pilgrim special? Ham, turkey and coleslaw. Naturally no chicken. - Hey, good luck, Lee. - Hey, see you tomorrow, Lee! Hey, what did I do, say something wrong? He doesn't like ham, turkey and coleslaw. He likes chicken. ♪ Face to face ♪ ♪ Mm mm mm ♪ ♪ La la lee ♪♪ Well.. They went about six hours ago. We caught her right away this time. What? The Russians, uh, launched. They're gonna get there first. So I guess that's the end of Pilgrim. So what does that mean, Lee? Um, well, nothing. Nothing's been cancelled. That's only a matter of time, isn't it? No. Why should it be? Lee, you know there can only be one first man on the Moon. You don't have a reason now, you wouldn't be a martyr just a possible suicide. Su? Wh-what difference does it make? It's-it's not suicide. Look, as long as the decision to land stays with me it's an acceptable proposition. What do you mean, acceptable proposition? Suppose you get hit by a meteor suppose you get a blast of radiation and you cook.. Well, you could suppose anything. Well, you suppose that you fall on your back and you can't get up because the bio-pack holds you down-- Would you cut it? Cut it. Or how would you like to get hit in the left eyeball by a dust-sized particle or a rock going 70,000 miles an hour? 'Alright, shut up, alright?' Gus? Is that what you were trying to tell me the other day? When? Huh? Look, what I wanna know is did you get into this one step at a time, Lee or did you jump in over your head? - Lee. - Huh? If you knew all these things all along.. ...you were lying like hell to me, weren't you? Honey, it could happen. It could happen. I mean, so-so can a lot of things happen. Accidents.. They're not, they're not.. You talked to her? - I tried, yes. - No, not to me, huh? Well, Ross ordered me not-- Ross ordered you not to talk to me but you could talk to her? Look, I wanted to stop you but you wouldn't listen to me, either. Y-you, you leaked the story, too, then. Oh, come off it! I don't know what you're talking about. You know, Chiz, Chiz at least was honest. I don't give a damn about it. Alright, what are you talking about? Come off it! I want you to survive. I value you. Um...you think I've been lying to you, is that it? 'I mean, you think I lied, huh?' Oh, Lee. - Lee. - Is that all? - Is-is that all? Hmm? - I guess that's all. Yeah, well, then you've got nothing to say, have you? Have you? Uh, you, you said "Oh, Lee" I think. Hmm? Lee, what happened to all the caution you promised me? What do you expect me to do? Smile? Yeah, you smile. You got that? Hmm? If it kills you, you just smile. 'Smile!' Hey, honey. Everything that could go wrong has. Well, the Russians are doing very well. Dr. Ehrman's opinion is that the unqualified radar beacon on our shelter substantially reduces our probability of success. It looks bad. But it's not officially a postponement until we get the definite word from Washington. Everything else is still working. The beacon is still up. Even if we decided, we still got a guidance problem. Look, we have a Surveyor up there, we could get it fixed. - You still got a-- - Russians are halfway there. What do you wanna go for, to congratulate them? They are going to have to land in sunlight. Now, that's gonna be a problem to them. They had a shortcut, uh to-to get the shot off early. Now I say that their chances are lousy and ours are still good. The Surveyor can't find it, we don't have a shelter. We know it's north and east of Hansteen, approximately. The only thing, the only thing that has been added to the risk of survival.. 'The only thing are the odds.' The odds of, of-of me aborting the mission when I get there. Now, we accepted that risk from the start. It's up there, it's warm, it's working. We're ready. I mean, so we're second, better by three days and a year. - Now, you don't see that, huh? - No, I don't. I'll be in Washington all day tomorrow, Lee. I'll back your point of view. We'll just proceed and see. 'The three-man Russian ship' 'is expected to land tomorrow morning.' 'And as usual, Moscow has released no information.' 'Even though the Russians will be the first on the Moon' 'Washington has made the decision' 'to go ahead with project Pilgrim.' 'So Lee Stegler will launch tomorrow morning as scheduled.' 'This the latest news from Washington.' Hey. Uh, where you been? - Just went for a drive. - Oh. - Uh, you left the TV set on. - Oh, stupid. Well, where'd you go? No place to go. I can't even go to the pool. 'Cause I dive off the board with microphones in their hands saying "Do you really think he'll come back, Mrs. Stegler?" Boy, they got neighbors after me, dull ones, too. The, uh, P.I.O. men down here say you've got a great image, honey. Oh, don't you believe it. Oh, the public will never forgive me for having a mother who was divorced and a father who drank too much and, dear, I am a blonde. And believe me, blondes have more fun. You're the, uh, American dream. 'Oh, brother.' Why don't we just play the scene out right here? We could and, you know, be headlines tomorrow because some guy is probably up in the air conditioner and he's, you know, with his creepy, peepy it'll be on network television tomorrow. The headlines will be "Astronaut, uh, takes wife to motel kisses her goodbye and blasts off to the Moon!" - It's--. - Honey. - Come on, honey. - Oh, Lee. Oh, I'm sorry, Lee. You wanted a good girl. They, um... wouldn't let me see you. Yeah, that's right. You'd be surprised what those big shots can do. Move the world, I heard. Can you spend the night? Uh, not-not all night, no. 'If I'm..' 'If I'm honest with myself, Mick..' '...I know I got sucked in.' 'I promised you caution, but uh..' 'Well..' It's easy, it's really easy. I never had to choose. There wasn't a time when I had to weigh the mission on one side, my life with you and Stevie on the other. I knew I'd be back, I never had a thought of not coming back. It's not fair but, uh.. That's the way it's gonna be. Because I, I can't cope with a choice like that one. I'm letting it slide. I don't believe I won't be back. I spent years.. ...thinking of myself taking that trip. I always thought I'm the guy that's gonna do it. That's why, uh.. If I, uh.. 'If I don't make this trip, Mick..' '...then, who the hell am I?' 'Forgive me.' 'Forgive me.' 'Be sure to wake me before you leave.' Okay, let's go. If you take care and don't blow your luck, I'll see you again. God go with you, Lee. - Right this way. - Goodbye, Lee. Hey. You forgot something, here. 'I can see I'm not gonna be alone.' 'Who's idea was this?' Stevie wanted to know if Jose couldn't go to the Moon. Why not? Yeah, why not? Have a good trip. 'Yeah, Chiz.' Now you've been ordered not to land unless you see the shelter and don't get any cute ideas. 'Cold helium and controlled helium..' '...both at flight pressure.' Control voltage on. Control computers on. Control accelerometers on. Q-ball system on. Send switch-11 on. 'Retro sequence selector off. Retro sequence clock read out.' 'Zero, zero.' 'Capsule recorders on.' T minus 13 minutes, 30 seconds and counting. Preliminary calibration command on for five seconds. Give cal start. Verified flight sequence is zero indication. Are you ready? Cannot verify IU at this time. What's the problem, Frank? We got a no go here at pre-check. 'It could have been a noise impulse, a onetime only' 'or it could be an intermittent problem.' 'We're checking all inputs.' 'I'd hate to have to hold the count.' Well, what is it? 'We'd better hold.' We are holding at 13 minutes and 2 seconds. There's a faulty readout, in your guidance computer. We're trying to run it down. At about 50 minutes before they have to postpone launch? 'We are clear.' 'S-C-124..' - '...30 seconds..' - 'Roger.' Count resumes at T minus 14. Going to automatic sequence. We're giving you four seconds to start lifting after commit. 'Otherwise, abort.' 'Roger.' Ten nine 'eight' 'seven' 'six' 'five' 'four' 'three' 'two' 'one.' 'Fire.' Roger, I have lift off. Clock is operating. 'Roger. Clock going.' Little bit of vibration feels good anyway. Roll okay. 'Three, two, one, mark.' Roger. Backup clock started running good. Altimeter up off the peg. Give you a hack in 30 seconds. Coming through the clouds now. 'You look good here.' Mark 30, okay. Fuel, okay. Oxygen, okay. All systems appear to be go. Some noise building now. Clear blue sky. 'Cabin pressure, 14.7 and dropping.' 'A beauty, Lee?' Okay, 25 amps and power looks good. 'Your pitch is 56.' Roger. Pitch is good. Fill the pitch program starting now. Sky is blackening. 'Roger.' 'Pitch 34, lovely.' Roger. She's nosing slow and easy now. Sun coming through the window. Wow, oxygen is go. Cabin pressure sealed at 5.5 and holding. 'Roger.' 'Confirmed, very good.' 'Pitch, minus four.' 'Roger. I agree on pitch.' Houston confirms, all go for orbital coast. Nice, sweet trajectory. Apogee 148 miles. Injection into lunar trajectory in ten minutes. Altitude of spacecraft will be 120 miles over Johannesburg. Almost perfect. Now, all we have to do is thread the needle. Fifteen seconds to injection. Ten nine 'eight' 'seven' 'six, five' 'four' 'three' two one. 'Fire.' Engine start. Eight tenth G. 'Ignition confirmed.' Vibration building. How's, uh, how's my flight path, CAPCOM, huh? How's, how's my, uh, flight path? 'Hold on.' Huh? 'Hold on.' Man, this thing is, uh, shaking badly. I, uh, I don't, I can't tell if she's gonna hold together. 'Hang on.' Speed is over 21,000. Hey, I don't know. 'We're an expected 300 from ignition.' 'Hold it together.' It's a wild horse, CAPCOM. It's bumpy as hell. Still gaining. It's too late for this boost, Chiz. Another minute and she's gonna buckle. 'Be prepared for manual cut off if you get in trouble.' Smoothing out a little. Uh, she's smoothing out. What-what about my path? 'Your path is fine, on the wire.' Coming up to, uh, cut off. Just like advertised. I feel separation. Separation confirmed. Our velocity is 24,515. Houston Fido confirms nominal cut off conditions. 'Right.' Right out of the ball park. Have a good trip. 'Lee, this is Thompson at the Cape.' 'Chiz and his group have left to catch their plane' 'for Houston mission control.' 'They will take over your flight from there' 'in approximately three hours.' 'Until then, we will continue control from here.' Yes, we'll be controlling from Houston mission control for the rest of the flight. I'll set you fellows up a press headquarters once we get there, okay? Hey, say what's this? This is a specially chartered plane. This stuff isn't rationed. Just got a report from Houston control. He's right on the button. We got a body temperature reading yet? No, I didn't get any medical report. Well, I want one. What was that? Nothing, nothing. But this only thing I don't understand Is why we have two drinks maximum on a flight. There's never a time a guy needs.. My dad had a furniture store there. I still, I still go there. I like it. 'All the sunshine..' - Hey. - Hello! Lee's been keeping up a running commentary ever since insertion. They've been trying to get him to nap but he won't. He never was much of a napper. It looks good, it really does. Well, I guess it's best not to talk about it. Chiz. I'm sorry. I really am. I guess I was afraid that if I start to talk then I'd never stop. Just turn inside out. You know, when all this first started I wasn't gonna put any pressure on. I was gonna open my eyes real wide 'and say, "Darling, this is a wonderful thing you're doing.' I'm proud of you." Then when it got down to it, down to the moment of truth I tried to stop him, I really did. I tried to stop him too, you know. I tried to break him every way I could. Well, Chiz, you're the one who'll be in the Apollo to bring him back. No, I don't think it'll be me. I have a feeling you only get one chance in this business. One time out. Lee's doing fine, honey, he really is. Pilgrim, we'll be coming to a short status report in two minutes. Got a mouth full of spaghetti and meat sauce. I want you to fire that chef. Hold on. We've planned you a midcourse correction for the 20th hour. - 'Roger!' - CAPCOM, this is Ehrman. Go ahead, Gus. I'd like another round of isometric exercises. Pilgrim, Ehrman requests another round of isometric exercises. What about my dinner, can I eat my dinner? 'Uh, uh, give in a little, will you, Lee?' Beginning isometrics. Biceps. What do you want me to do with that? - Check these out. - Okay. 'Ahem, see now, where was I?' Oh, the, uh, the midcourse correction has begun the cryogenic fueled landing engine will push the capsule into a slightly changed path. You're, you're blocking us, you're blocking us. This would be to minimize the air 'and get the astronaut the best possible view of the area' where the shelter would be found. Now to abort, he, uh, he just doesn't fire again. And he'll, he'll figure eight. 'If you get any voice command from me' 'punch in and override the automatic.' 'Roger.' Nine, eight seven, six 'five, four' 'three, two' 'one. Mark.' I've got, uh.. Well, that sun is, uh.. I've, I've got no light. 'Well, they should be firing.' I've, I've got no light, uh.. I felt the thrust but my fire.. Engine fire indicator isn't on. 'Should I override?' Systems? Confirmed firing. No, firing's confirmed. 'Rick, come here.' 'Uh, Pilgrim, your trajectory's fine.' 'You're sure no color or light at all?' 'Negative.' 'Lee, check the bulb, check the breaker.' 'If it's a short we'll find it.' 'Roger' - What do you think it is? - 'I don't know yet.' Should this show up on any of the breadboards? It should, let's take a look at it anyway. I'm riding this thermostat down here for the last ten minutes. Trying to keep the temperature constant in here, I'm losing. 'Understand.' What do you mean "Understand?" What's the word down there? 'We're doing it as fast as we can.' Say again. I said, we're doing it as fast as we can. If the solenoids jam, we get a warning indicator. We should. If it jammed in a closed position.. Then he's still draining his batteries and he's in one hell of a spot. Let's try and run through the simulation record and find a comparable problem here. It can't be done.. We have no record of malfunction. That malfunction could be anywhere. Power could be draining here, or here. - He loses heat, he loses radio. - Heat and radio. All the automatic sequencing nowhere-- - 'You've gotta find it.' - Alright. Here, show him the big board. 'Set me up all the electrical sequences' 'in that spacecraft, from A-9, A-16 'through 0250.' I think his thermostat's off. Radio transmission is deteriorating. - Any change? - Radio transmission's faulty. It keeps cutting out. Lee, this is Chiz. Do you read? 'Uh, what's, what's the.. Uh, have you had any sleep since the first break? Negative, we got plenty to do. 'You'll be sleeping a while.' 'Now listen we believe that there's, uh' 'some arc...at the launch.' Repeat, rep.. At the launch there was some arcing and you're losing electrical power. There's no way to repair without a risk of the retros firing and sending you out of trajectory. You'd never get back. - What? - 'You'd never get back.' 'I want you to cut off as many electrical systems' 'as possible.' As possible? 'Right.' 'Attitude control will be normal.' Now go on to suit pressure and heat, and let your cabin-- 'Repeat, repeat.' Go on to suit pressure and heat and let your cabin temperature go down. And turn the thermostat down. 'Thermostat down.' 'Right.' 'Roger. On manual.' Now I want you to cut off your radio transmitter and other RF systems, except Bio-Med. - 'Set your, watch for--' - Uh, what? Repeat. 'Set your stopwatch for four hours' 'and we'll make contact then.' Oh, that's, that's too long I think. 'I-I didn't read. Repeat.' Um.. I-I don't think, uh that I should be cut off that long. Don't fight me now, Lee, you've got other things to worry about, I said I'd get you there. 'I'm, uh, Ahem!' 'I'm worried. I'm afraid, uh..' 'I'm afraid these controls might freak out' 'when the temperature drops.' He's doesn't wanna cut off his radio. That's his only lifeline. Lee, you're instructed to sleep. Now set your timer. we'll take a status report every four hours. Trust me. You got to hell, I don't want to sleep-- 'Cut it off.' Going on suit pressure. Resume radio contact in four hours. We got a couple of hours, you're gonna get some sleep? Um, no, I think I'll stick around. Okay, well, call me if anything. Honey, it's alright. I got some fresh clothes. You'll feel better if you change. Okay. Thank you. Is that his heart beat? That's chest. Left side. What's that? Respiration. 'Breathing.' 'Blood pressure.' Temperature. We take intermittent readings. You see, we're watching him constantly, Mickey. He's doing very well. 'Functioning beautifully.' But everything's all wrong. They'll find a way to fix it. Uh, Pilgrim control now reports that uh, Astronaut Lee Stegler having successfully completed his midcourse maneuver. He's now observing a period of radio silence. Plan for this stage of the mission, he'll be uh, sleeping, exercising. Uh, I know you're all interested in the three-man Russian ship Voskhod. Well, they should have landed on the Moon twelve to fourteen hours ago. But up to now, no word has been received. Now, while Lee Stegler is sleeping we'd like to make perfectly clear to you the plan of Pilgrim project. Now, when Lee Stegler lands on the Moon he'll immediately make his way to this survival shelter. 'Which contains all the necessary life support systems.' 'He'll find it by means of this rotating beacon.' Once inside the shelter he'll remain there until we send up another survival shelter or until the Apollo team goes up to get him. Uh, the telemetry aboard the shelter will notify us immediately the minute he's safely inside. Uh, for those of you, who'd like copies and photographs of this shelter, why, there are some here on the table 'and any other paraphernalia you may think you might need.' 'In one hour, I want you to start raising the thermostat.' 'Raise thermostat.' Raising thermostat. Raise it at 30 degree jumps. Uh, I, I don't think, I can depend on these sequences. - 'Never...sequences..' - Wha-what? Repeat. 'Don't, ne-never mind sequences we'll talk you through.' 'Told you, we'll get you there.' I understand. Roger all instruments. Give visual report. 'Uh, getting...good... read off..' 'but, but, nothing from shelter.' 'Roger.' We have you at 600 miles lunar altitude. Any sighting of the shelter? No, I, uh.. I don't see the beacon. I estimate another six minutes to reach maximum viewing angle. Swing her around and sight from the window. 'How's it handling?' Uh, it's a little sluggish, maybe some freeze up in the attitude jets. 'How's it handling? Say again.' 'Lee, how is it handling? Do you read?' 'How is it handling?' Oh, my God. 'Do you read me? How is it handling, Lee?' Operational, operational. 'Difficulty...here.' - 'Repeat.' - 'Do you read?' 'Uh, it's fantastic, Chiz.' 'No sign of beacon.' 'Tell me if you've sighted.' Do you read? Have you sighted the shelter? 'Uh, negative, negative.' We'll, get into retrofire position. He's right on trajectory. 'Retrofire position.' Repeat. 'Get into retro fi..' - 'Do you read?' - Roger, roger, roger. 'Have you sighted, Pilgrim?' The monitor's giving a great view of the surface. 'I'm covering the entire impact area.' 'I have not.' 'Repeat, I, I have not, sighted..' 'Wait a minute and repeat.' 'Difficulty in reading you is severe.' I want that signal hyped up so we can hear it. The signal to noise is too low he hasn't got the voltage. 'You've got three minutes, friend.' 'Have you sighted the she..' Checking up, uh, towards Hansteen. 'There're some reflections.' No, I, I don't see them now. 'Do you re..' 'Do not land if you..' Repeat. - Huh? - 'Do not land..' 'If you don't see it.' Haven't found it. Uh, look for the blinky, you should be able to see it now. - Don't land unless you see it. - 'Haven't found it.' Under no circumstances attempt to land 'unless you have a confirmed sighting.' Verify, verify before you land. We feel you're getting weaker. 'Cannot read you, Chiz.' 'Is there anything, Lee?' Commit comes in 65 seconds. 'Um..' I, I can't see it, uh.. 'It's within 20 miles. Look!' 'You don't have any more time to play around.' 'Ninety sec, now forget it and' 'put her into lunar orbit, Pilgrim.' 'Do you read?' I, uh, I believe I see it. Uh, give me, give me retro fire count. 'I don't understand. I want a confirmation.' 'Give some verification.' 'I, I, I believe I see it east of Hansteen.' 'Give me a count.' 'Verify..' I said count. 'Fifteen seconds to thirty seconds..' Twenty seconds to fire. 'Fifteen seconds.' Ten nine, eight, seven six, five, four three 'two, one.' 'Fire.' Engine firing. He cut the cord he can't come back. 'Ignition confirm, firing and deceleration.' 'Do you read, Pilgrim?' Pilgrim control. Do you read? One thousand feet. Hovering. Altitude rockets are firing. Still hovering. Is he alright? Fast, hard. I think he's blacking out. Come on, Lee, come on. How long has that thing burned? Five hundred feet. Going very easy. 'Landing gear activated.' 'Rate of descent seven feet per second.' 'Cut off.' Zero altitude. He's down. My God, he's made it. Hold it, hold it just a minute, everybody. 'May I have your attention please?' Mission control reports that Pilgrim has just landed successfully on the Moon. Pilgrim, Pilgrim control. Do you read? Pilgrim? Pilgrim control. Do you read? Pilgrim? Pilgrim control? Do you read? Pilgrim? Pilgrim control? Do you read? Oh, let's see he's got another almost three hours of oxygen left. Two hours and forty minutes. He couldn't have reached the shelter. If he started to activate it we'd have received telemetry on it. He didn't see it, I knew it when he landed. He said, "Believe I've sighted." That's an old fighter pilot phrase. What you say when you fire into the dark and hope you hit a target. "I believe I have sighted." Why would he land without being sure? Yeah, Chiz, you tell him. Why would he land without being sure? I told him not to land unless he was sure. He didn't have anything to prove to me. Gus, knock it off. Look.. The man made his decision that's why he was there in the spacecraft. No matter how it's programmed, but when the time comes the man makes the decision. He sees that lunar surface like clean snow. Nobody's touched it yet. Gravitational pull of the Moon is very strong to the mind with imagination. That's why Stegler is sitting there now waiting for his oxygen to run out. Anybody with the courage to go would have landed. What's the mystery? There's no mystery that's why Stegler is there. Coming in? I don't know where I should be while he is dying. He won't. You had exactly one hour to play that game. Time stopped. Have you talked to Stevie? What would I tell him? Safe landing. Alright. Then what do I say to his next question? You just gonna sit here? New Moon, full Earth. I'm sorry? The phases of the Moon are the opposite of the phases of the Earth 'He sees us big.' You have no right to cheer me up. There are no storms on the Sea of Storms, are there? No storms. Will he come.. Hey, gentlemen. We know Lee Stegler's on the Moon. But radio communication is out, he has approximately forty five minutes of oxygen left in his bio pack in which to find and activate the shelter. I just received word that the shelter had not been activated. Lee Stegler has less than seven minutes of oxygen left. Um.. However since radio communication is out why, we're not exactly sure of his status and uh, it's, it's possible that.. Well, we'll-we'll keep you informed certainly when anything, anything, uh, of any definite, uh, nature..
