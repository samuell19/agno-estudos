Welcome back to the UK., sir. Madam. Enjoy your stay. Sorry. Oh, sorry, if you could just excuse me a moment, guys. Just give me a moment? - Hello? - Hi, Nicole. - Andy, how are you? - Okay, good. I'm busy at the moment. I got your message. What's happening? Pinochet's here. He came in on a commercial flight this time. - Have you found him? - No no no no, not yet, but we will. We'll find him for you, Andy, okay? General, what is it? Oh, my back. You may leave us. Ve te. Que es Pinochet. Lo he visto. Madam Pinochet. Who are you, for God's sake? Where's the chief of staff? This is a diplomatic matter, madam. Not for the army. What's taken you so long? I came on the first flight. I know you're keen for your operation, General, so why not bring your surgeon to Chile, bring your nurses, anyone you need? How nice. Why? Your security, General. I'm not secure? I don't need to remind you that in Spain they're building a case to bring you to trial. So you want me to change my plans for the sake of some Spanish notaries? This makes no sense, Augusto, take the man's advice. Don't let him upset you. I am an honoured guest in this country. If you want to go, I'm sure our friend here can manage some travel arrangements. Nicole? Hi, it's Andy. Andy, we've found Pinochet. We've got him! You'll never believe this. He's checked into a private hospital. What? You're kidding me? - How long for? - He's having an operation. This is our chance to get him. The Spanish investigations into Argentina and Chile, they're just getting underway. If we could get Pinochet over to Juan Garces in Madrid, he could face charges for all the Spanish victims taken in Chile. Are you okay? Okay, sir. Hello, sir. Hi. I'd like to report an international torturer and mass murderer. He's just down the road in the London Clinic. I see, sir. Over 3,000 victims. I thought you might like to arrest him. Just a minute, sir. As I remember, these crimes were committed in Chile, not Marylebone. You want International Crimes Division, Scotland Yard. I've been there, and up as far as the Attorney General. Oh, with little luck it seems. You've been trying since-- since 1991, it says. He's been visiting on and off on arms business. We've tried to push criminal charges but the Met's never moved on them. Conspiracy to murder and torturer just doesn't appear to cut the mustard. So this time I thought that I would try you because he's here, on your beat. And what makes you think it would be any different this time? Because we've now had international arrests for war crimes in Rwanda, in the Balkans. Listen, McEntee... you're on a fascinating crusade here, but without some serious authorizations, I don't see what I can do. What about an extradition order? Beg your pardon? An extradition order from Spain would trump the Met's discretion, wouldn't it? We can get Pinochet for you. He's flat on his back in a hospital. This is a unique opportunity, but it needs your lead, Senor Garces. Okay. We'll send the Spanish charges to you as soon as-- No, Senor Garces, hold on. It has to start with you in Madrid. It can only work as extradition. But if our charges don't work there then everything is lost for us. But nothing is going to happen here. Without an arrest warrant from you, we can just forget it. How long before he can be moved? Just get a plane here fast. British Airways can get him out on the first flight to Chile. Hello, Andy? It's Nicole. I've got to know what's happening. There's people ringing the whole time. It's getting tricky. Steve, shut up! There's no sign of a warrant, not a sausage. No fucking chorizo. You let me know straightaway? Okay. So, Pam, are we going to arrest him? Not as yet, Home Secretary. Before they send the warrant for Pinochet, the Spanish are awfully keen to know whether we intend to collaborate - and detain him here for extradition. - They want to know if we're going to push it through? - That's right. And tell me, Pam, are we going to push it through? Normally, we wouldn't in a case like this, no. Meaning the Tories would have let him go. With a nod and a wink and a limo to the airport. It may not be to the letter of the law perhaps, but extradition is a messy business at the best of times and this is unprecedented. I know, but that's no reason to suspend the rule of law though, is it, Pam? No, I think we should go ahead and offer full support to the Spanish. Yes? All right, let's go. - Listen. - What is this? General Pinochet is now in our custody. You and your men are required to leave the building immediately. No no no no no no. It's General Pinochet. Can you hear me, General? Wh-- what is this? I don't know. It's the police. Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, between the 11th of September 1973 and the 31st of December 1990, you did authorize and conspire with persons unknown to commit hostage taking, to inflict severe pain and suffering, and to commit murder on a wide scale. Included were Spanish citizens in Chile, which alleged conduct constitutes an extradition crime within the jurisdiction of the National Court of Madrid. You-- you cannot kidnap me. General, you're not going anywhere. Good evening. The former Chilean dictator, General Augusto Pinochet, has been arrested by police in London. The general, who was receiving medical treatment here, has been detained over allegations that he murdered Spanish citizens between 1973 and 1990. General Augusto Pinochet was perhaps the most notorious and reviled of Latin American military dictators. He led a military coup in 1973 against the democratically-elected government. For the next 17 years, with the support of the United States, he ruthlessly suppressed all left-wing movements and dissent. His authoritarian rule brutalized Chilean society. Over 3,000 people were executed by his regime and 1200 are still missing. To this day, the families of the disappeared are still trying to find out what became of their loved ones. - You called... - Andy! Come in, come in. Nice paintings. Oh God, I hate them. They're nothing to do with me. I'm sorry it's been full on this morning-- I never even made it out the front door. Thanks for coming over. Oh, its okay, it's okay. Everybody is so... I-- we can't believe it! It's so brilliant! It it's-- well, thanks to the Spanish. You-- you know it's 10 years since Amnesty took on my sister's case and-- and in that time, I-- I never imagined anything like this. Nobody did. You know, thank you, Andy! Well, hold on, let-- let-- let's get him to Spain first. People are beginning to organize already. Which is why we have to talk. However your protest develops, we must keep close links. Are you offering me a job, Andy? No no, I'm not, but I do want you to be the point of contact between us. We will be a self-determining group, non-hierarchical. Yeah yeah, of course you are, yeah. The choice of any new representatives will have to be made through the group as a whole. - This is the big time now. - Of course! And I'll help, Andy. We all will, however we can. Can you believe it, Mr. Caplan? Creeping in, in the middle of the night to my hospital bed, for God's sake! It's an outrage. I didn't come here as a common bandit to be arrested, Mr. Caplan. I was received as an honoured guest. Here, show him my passport. Thank you. Yes, Senator, you're absolutely right. This is all about immunity-- less diplomatic immunity, more State immunity. No head of state has ever been prosecuted abroad. You are beyond our jurisdiction, and I would say in this case, the victim of politics. Yes. It is political. Always I'm hounded by communists. General, really. Do you see how precarious this is legally? You are being detained here in England to face trial in Spain for crimes allegedly committed in Chile. Your prosecutors are trying their luck, frankly. And you'll show all this in court, Mr. Caplan? We shall be arguing this most strongly, I assure you, Senator. Mr. Caplan, friends call me "my general.” It's now up to the courts in Britain to determine whether the decision to arrest Pinochet will be upheld. And then the Home Secretary also has to give his authority for the general's extradition to Spain. Though he has friends in high places over here, the general must be wondering, as he sits under guard in his hospital bed, quite when or if he will be returning home. To what degree can a head of state be held personally responsible for the crimes perpetrated by his regime? Well done, you. Nice one. - What? - This dictator you've got-- Pinochet. - Thank you, Will. - About time we saw some of this ethical foreign policy you all promised us. Where are you going? Out. I've finished working. But I... out where? Just out, all right? See you later, Dad. Well done. - Pinochet! - To pay for your crimes! - Pinochet! - Now is the time... - Pinochet! - ...to pay for your crimes! - Pinochet! - Now is the time... - Pinochet! - ...to pay for your crimes! - Pinochet! - Now is the time... - Pinochet! - ...to pay for your crimes! - Pinochet! - Now is the time... - Pinochet! - ...to pay for your crimes! - Pinochet! - Now is the time... - Pinochet! - ...to pay for your crimes! Pinochet... Well done. Good. This is playing brilliantly with the party! With all the grief we're getting from the backbenchers over the benefits clampdowns, the timing of this couldn't be better, really. This is extraordinary that Pinochet of all people should pop up like this, I mean out of the past. Everything else from the '70s is being revived, why not brutal South American dictators? Talking of which, there's a tirade from Lady Thatcher in "The Times.” There you are then. Not so good from Chile though. Their government really aren't happy with us interfering. I saw. Well, if they won't bring him to justice, - what do they expect? - You're right. Besides, he won't be here long, will he? Can torture and murder be considered as official functions of a head of state and so attract immunity? That's the discussion in there. Let's say that the general gets himself a nice little holiday home over here. And let's say that he takes against his English gardener and one day he kills him. As a former head of state, in England, is he immune from prosecution? Well, is he? If he gets away now after all this, it's worse. Pinochet's in the system. That's what counts. It's like pinball. He'll-- he'll bounce around for a bit and if we're any good, he won't drop out of play. That is shit! How often does the House of Lords overturn cases for appeal? I've been reading. Never. But when did they last have to cope with an international human-rights case on this scale? Never. And for the first time, Amnesty is on the inside as interveners, so it's up to you lot to keep this in people's faces. - Heard you on the radio the other day. - Oh? Bit of variety might be nice, eh? - Pardon? - Well, you know, we don't want people to get bored or to go deaf. Thanks, Andy. Look, I'm just saying, you know, we get a lot of offers of help from P.R. companies and media companies trying to absolve themselves. It's entirely up to you. And-- and we've got to make it tough for him. We have to let people know. We have to let everybody know what this guy's done. Yes. Absolutely. Your passion is really coming across, and in most cases that's great, but I wonder if you're relishing this situation as revenge. Yes. It is revenge. I'm enjoying this like you could never imagine. You don't want to put that across. Anger for justice, sure. Not too much. You've got to be careful-- he's an old man laid up in hospital. So what? Pinochet should suffer here, and we intend to contribute to that as much as we can. But is he responsible for all these crimes? Yes, he is. I mean him personally. Of course he's responsible. What are you talking about? If you want sympathetic media exposure, and that's why you're here-- Who takes responsibility then? We don't know the truth yet about Pinochet's regime-- the facts. We're nowhere close. My sister Jacqueline was taken by Pinochet's secret police in October, 1974. We got no news of her from the authorities, ever. No confirmation even that she ever existed. One of 1,200 vanishing acts, in fact. I have old photos of her, her embroidery, her hairbrush, a bra I wore for years even though it was too small for me and it hurt like crazy. Dull things-- unlike her. My mother even tore up the bed sheet she had taken from Jacqueline's flat that day and divided it between us. I still have my piece, even though I now know my sister was raped repeatedly on that bed before they took her away. I keep it because it's a fact- one of the few knowable facts about what happened to her. Now for that, Pinochet is responsible! - Oh! - Oh. Oh... no. Oh, I'm sorry, General. Let me return when it's more-- No no, come in and meet some of my family. This is Mr. Caplan. In a few days' time, he is going to put an end to all this insanity. Actually, General, the case is extending, which is not unexpected. It's good, madam. My Lords, for the reasons set out in the speech which I have prepared and which is available in print, I would hold that the respondent as a former head of state is immune from arrest and I would dismiss the appeal. My Lords, in my opinion, the State of Chile is entitled to claim immunity on behalf of Senator Pinochet under the terms of the State Immunity Act of 1978 and at Common Law. I would therefore dismiss the appeal. My Lords, I hold that the respondent, Senator Pinochet, is not immune from the criminal process of this country of which extradition forms part. My Lords, I would allow the appeal. The effect of my speech is that in a correct interpretation of the law, General Pinochet has no immunity whatever. My Lords, I've had the advantage of reading in draft the speeches of my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Steyn. I agree with them that Senator Pinochet does not have immunity from prosecution and I, too, would therefore allow the appeal. The dining room is through here. General? General? What is that? It's a camera, General. - They're everywhere, I'm afraid. - Why? Security conditions laid down by the Home Office. Madam... Here's the bedroom. Bathroom is en suite, I believe. Where is my wife's room? The other rooms are assigned, General, - for the police and staff. - None of this is acceptable. We can't change this now, General. You are under house arrest. Let's focus our efforts instead on getting you home. Leave us. Leave us, I said. Get out of my sight! You can't go out, I'm afraid, sir. The garden's out of bounds. I have no escape plan, I assure you. Sorry, sir, it's a precaution for your own safety... against intruders, kidnappers. No, you're mistaken. You are the kidnappers! Now if you don't let me pass, I will see to it that you are removed from your duties. Madam! I said, move away from the door, sir! Back inside. You're never gonna believe this prick. Did you see that? Right. Let's really play this by the book then. The procedure for your toilet visits will be as follows: You will need to be accompanied by an officer-- male officer. Signal to one of the cameras and we'll respond. On what authority do you dare to do this? The Geneva Convention, sir-- --dealing with the treatment of prisoners at risk of self-harm or suicide. Oh, take this shit away. Not mine. Did I say take mine? Here's to Pinochet in an English courtroom next week. It is only to register bail, okay? - Do you think you can get her in? - Yeah, we'll try. What's he like-- up close? I don't know. I've never seen him. Would the respondent please give his name? I am... General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, President of the Republic and now Senator of the Republic of Chile. As authorized by the Home Secretary, you are charged with the following offences to be heard in Spain: torture, conspiracy to commit torture, attempted murder, conspiracy to attempt murder, taking of hostages, conspiracy to take hostages. Is there anything you wish to say? With respect to Your Honour, I do not recognize the jurisdiction of any other court except in my own country to try me against all the lies of Spain. Your objection is entered into the record. Is that all? There's just one more small matter, sir. Joining us, I think, on the telephone is Evelyn Matthei, who is a friend of General Pinochet. What did you think when you heard what the British Law Lords had decided? I think that the justice is never really so independent of the public opinion. And the public opinion has been very much against Senator Pinochet for the last 25 years. Now we have heard that Lord Leonard Hoffman, his wife is very much linked to Amnesty International. If that were to be true, then it would be a scandalous ruling. Well, I don't see what his-- his wife has got to do with it. I mean he is known as a-- as a liberal figure in the judiciary, is he-- is he not? I mean we'd all agree on-- on that. I think we can suggest bias in the lord's ruling. With Lord Hoffman. Well, his wife works for Amnesty and he serves as a director of Amnesty International Charity Limited. It's not enough to suggest his ruling was biased. You don't need to argue actual bias, only potential bias, or even the appearance of potential bias. And look at it-- Hoffman delivers the casting vote against Pinochet, and he's linked up with Amnesty. Which isn't disclosed to the public or to our client, for whatever reasons. And Amnesty are part of the prosecution, for God's sake. How does that appear? This is complete fucking bollocks. Oh, no no no, they're-- they're clutching at straws. Hoffman's involvement with us is no secret. And the idea of bias, that's just a joke! We once asked him to revoke a death sentence in the Bahamas-- he let the bloke go to the gallows. - He never gives us an inch. - The former Chilean dictator, General Augusto Pinochet, has been given another chance to claim that he shouldn't be prosecuted on charges of genocide and torture. General Pinochet's political opponents never miss an appointment with the English legal system. But today they witnessed something quite extraordinary. For the first time, the Law Lords set aside one of their own judgments. The judges accepted that Lord Hoffman should never have sat on General Pinochet's original appeal last month because of his close links with a campaign group that took part in the hearing. For somebody who says he doesn't recognize the jurisdiction of the English courts, General Pinochet has done more than most to expose their weaknesses and strengths. - What is it? - A gift. It's anonymous, there's no card. Oh, well, we must get in a police taster! It may be poisoned. A victory, Mr. Caplan? Is that right? It is, madam, indeed. What sort of victory, Mr. Caplan? Well, it's a piece of legal history, in fact, madam-- the first time in 1,000 years that the Law Lords, the British Supreme Court, have revoked one of their own decisions. Mm, that's nice. - What happens now? - I am free to go? Not quite yet, General. Is the government prepared to let Pinochet go? General Pinochet's extradition is a judicial matter, not a political one. The outcome will be for a new panel of Law Lords to decide. I can't intervene in the legal process. My role here is simply to execute it. We've got to get things moving, Pam. I mean the idea of-- of Pinochet holed up in Surrey for much longer, it's not good. I wanted him off my hands by Christmas. Excuse me. Excuse me. What-- what-- what is all this racket about? The Chilean General Pinochet is under house arrest here. Yes, I'm quite aware of that. He's four doors down from me and across from Russ Abbott. We have to make our protest felt. You should be angry with him, not with us. I'm not angry with you. I just want you to keep it down until lunchtime. Well, protests are noisy things, and it is our right to be here, but I am sure we can come to an agreement. Who is that? Is she your daughter? Uh, no. She's my sister. She was taken by Pinochet's men 24 years ago. We never saw her again. She's so pretty. What happened to her? I know she was moved around, held in detention centers. I know she was tortured and raped. She was in prison? They took over suburban houses just like these, and filled them up with prisoners-- three in the bathroom, two in the closet, one in the cupboard, blindfolded. They chose houses with basements for the interrogations. You don't have to go on. But tell me, what had your sister done? Well, nothing to deserve that, if that's what you mean. Who could deserve that? Corpus Christi. Corpus Christi. Antonio! Were you spying on us? Come on. I'm not saying it will be or won't be. We shouldn't rely on it either. We should think ahead. I thought those lords took forever. Not with the whole world watching them. But it won't just be a rerun. Pinochet's already lost once on his immunity, so it will be risky for his defence to keep pushing that. This time, they're going to attack the extradition case. What are you talking about? Most of the crimes were committed at a time when the British courts had no jurisdiction over torture committed abroad. That could well be their line now. The UN. Torture Convention wasn't signed by the U.K. in Spain until late 1988. So any torture conducted before that date doesn't qualify for extradition? That's crazy. Forget it. Look, this is about interpreting the law, it's not about justice. It's your job to remind people about the justice. The scale of it, the numbers? We need some kind of spectacle to show what Pinochet must answer for. Dada, are you sure about this? You must go with the family. Don't let them feel they've taken two prisoners. Yes, of course. I will see things are done. So much time alone with my wife... the one masterstroke of my enemies. We fill Parliament Square with crosses, one for every victim of the regime, each with a name and photograph. - The idea is this in miniature. - Brilliant. And right there in front of the lords to remind them every day. - But can we do it? - I think I can design it. No. No. No. The cross is an insult to the memory of the atheists and communists amongst them. No! Just the pictures then? Their faces on sticks in the ground. Then they look like fucking lollipops! Crosses are the right image-- line after line of crosses. No! I veto. I will not have communists represented by a Christian symbol. Then tell me, Ernesto, which one of them was not crucified? It can't be. I don't believe it. Is it...? It is. Good afternoon. - Lady Thatcher. - Thank you. I'm ashamed you should see me like this. I am the one ashamed. How are you coping? Like a soldier, madam. That's splendid to hear. But I can get no real sense of when this will end. It's like being on a wheel: promises, verdict, appeal. Well, the wheel is turning our way now, General. Time to apply pressure. Don't leave it to lawyers. You need a campaign. So far the agenda has been set by your enemies; this is what we must change. Let the people see what really happened to Chile under your rule. We need to rally support, show the world what you're enduring here. Thank you, Lady Thatcher. Ah, excellent! I see my supplies made it across enemy lines. Hello? Is that Westminster Parks Department? -Yes. - Is it Mr. Bentham? Oh, it is? Oh, that's wonderful. I have a request, Mr. Bentham, about Parliament Square. Do you have a moment? Where do you live, Officer? Miles away, in a different world. Big bucks round here-- Hollywood on Thames. Who lives here then? Golfers, celebrities... Bruce Forsyth. Russ Abbott. I don't know. Ronnie Corbett. - Sean Connery. - Oh, Sean Connery, yes! Yeah, I don't know about him actually. Are you married, Officer? - Why? - Oh, the ring. Yeah, I'm engaged. Ah, that's good! Later in the year, we hope. And your fiance, I think he too is a police officer? Yes yes. Yes, he is, yeah. How did you know? I understand policemen. I apologize. What for? For my behaviour... when I first came here. You were doing your duty. You said I could call again when you had checked with-- I'm sorry, nothing's changed. Oh, so it's still a no, is it, Mr. Bentham? - I'm afraid so. - Okay. Can I call again tomorrow? If you wish. I was a dictator only in the Roman sense: a leader, someone to take on all power for a while to cope with the grave emergency. You tell me what was totalitarian about my rule-- no indoctrination, no ideology, no cult of Pinochet. Not handsome enough perhaps? Not like Guevara. Oh, please. And in Cuba, Castro still grips hold of absolute power. I yielded to democracy, but it is me here under arrest. All I did was set out to rebuild Chile after the rubble left by Allende. But people were killed and tortured during that rebuilding? There was brutality on both sides. Don't forget that! Terrorist bombs, communist call-to-arms. Human rights, I say. There has to be human rights for both sides. Did you ever give orders that anyone should be tortured? I did not. To say that is gross slander. I didn't have time to control what others were doing, and when I did learn of these things, then it was too late. And always I relayed it to the courts. Well then, who was responsible for torture in Chile? I cannot say, because this is something that has to be investigated by the justice system. Would you arrest your own leaders for what is happening now in Kosovo? Then why are you vilified by so many of your countrymen? Is it really so many? When the coup happened, many went free; they came here to Britain-- to France, Spain, Sweden-- to be feted by socialists. And after 20 years, they're still here, unwilling to accept the defeat of their cause and the boom at home. Instead, they sustain their campaign which claims that I am a monster. But there are many Chileans who take a different view-- those who stayed. The witness, the children who survived, the elderly who stay alive, the houses that have been built, was any of this ever achieved by the socialists? Chile has become the miracle free-market economy of South America. I think Lady Thatcher was watching closely. So... perhaps you owe a tiny bit of your own prosperity to this monster before you. Hey? That is wonderful! Thank you! I promise we will not damage your grass! I-I-- I have a grass expert right here! - Hello? - You're the grass expert? Yes, uh-huh. Yes, I am. The House of Lords has drastically reduced the number of charges that the former Chilean dictator should face. In the light of that, the Home Secretary Jack Straw has said he'll reconsider whether the extradition should proceed. The main charges on which the Law Lords said that General Pinochet could face extradition accused him of responsibility for torture. But the English courts won't send someone for trial in a foreign country unless he's accused of something that would be a crime under English law, and torture outside the UK. Didn't become an offence here until late 1988. So the torture of my own sister means nothing in British law? That is disgusting to me. It's-—- it's like watching your neighbours abusing their child and saying you can do nothing about it because it's not your garden. It's disgusting. If it's true that there's only one Spanish case left in place after this decision, then I'd say: when did it become a requirement that we only pursue serial Killers? I can't see why today's ruling should alter the Home Secretary's course of action in extraditing Pinochet. Do you? No. She hasn't got much luggage. Then perhaps it really is all over. I agree with you. Excuse me. What's he doing here? The lords decimated the extradition case, then ask you to reconsider whether it should proceed. We think it's a pretty strong signal to drop it. But they couldn't throw it out, could they? And they're leaning on us, Jonathan. Yeah, well, Jack, right time to lean! I mean the grief this Pinochet situation is giving us now-- the man's a catastrophe! Half of South America is up in arms, Chile's off the scale, there's trade and arms deals to consider, pressure from the Americans, even the Vatican's requesting his release-- that German cardinal. But I can't see any of that gives us grounds to intervene, no matter how much grief you're getting from Washington, Jonathan. It would lay us right open. We could end up with a judicial review. I'm just saying, don't get out of step. You do need to look into this. Tony feels we might have made our point with this now. It's an honour to be received by the saviour of Chile. It's an honuor to be received by one of the true heroes of the Falklands War. It is my honour to welcome you to my simple house. Will you come inside, Lady Thatcher? Yes, I'd like that, Senator. Good morning. Thank you. Thank you very much. Today is Pinochet's day. Nobody can help us here. We are alone. "Jack Straw faces awkward questions over a visit to Chile 33 years ago. The Home Office admitted that as a radical student activist Mr. Straw met left-wingers in Chile in 1966, but denied suggestions that the man who now holds the general's fate in his hands later joined demonstrations against his dictatorship.” If they want to fit me up like they did Lord Hoffman, they'll have to do - better than that. - You never told me about any of this. Wake up, Will, it's "The Mail" on Sunday. I've got quite enough Pinochet pressure on me at the moment. Send him packing to Spain then, pronto. That's Italian, not Spanish. Did you-- do you honestly think it's as easy as that? Oh, it's the Pinochet chap, isn't it? Oh, you got your man then? No no, Inspector, you got him! Well, he's still here after six months. That's... that's not a bad result, is it? - Is that why you're here? - Uh, yes. Today the Home Secretary is announcing whether the extradition can proceed. - Yes, I heard. - Just in case he decides to go against it, I'm here to issue a challenge to the magistrate. It's our own injunction just to stop him making a quick getaway. But the Home Secretary hasn't actually announced his decision yet, has he? No, but it's due at any moment. It's just better to be safe than sorry, eh? We have just heard that Jack Straw has announced extradition proceedings can go ahead against the former Chilean dictator, General Augusto Pinochet. I signed a second authority to proceed in respect of General Pinochet yesterday evening. I'm satisfied that I took this decision with an open mind. - What? - Nothing. Nicole! It's your sister! Nicole? Michele. You look so tired. Are you okay? Fine. Tired, yes. Come here. I'm sorry, Michele. It's been crazy here for so long. It's good to see you. How long are you staying? I've only just arrived; she's trying to get rid of me. I was hoping to come with you - to see Pinochet in court. - Of course! And... there is something else. But not now. And just what do you intend to do now, Mr. Caplan? We'll lodge an appeal, of course, madam. I don't think there's any need for undue concern. Another of your appeals? You are a cat running out of lives, Mr. Caplan. Me? Look, madam, nothing would give me more pleasure than the sight of you and your husband boarding a plane home, but until that day comes you must bear up and abide by the rule of law, however arduous or novel a prospect that may be. And how convenient for your lawyers' fees, Mr. Caplan. Madam, we have no choice but to try and stall the extradition case. That is unless you want to take it up personally with the Home Secretary, but I don't think you'll twist his arm. You're awake. Shall I make tea? What's the matter? I just met someone in Paris who knew our sister. - Oh, yes? - A good friend. She saw Jacqueline only a few days before she was taken. - Who is this woman? - I said a friend. Had you heard of her before? No, Nicole, but as she told me, I was sure they were close. And? Jacqueline was pregnant... nearly four months. And you believe her, do you? I do. I think I've always known-- Well, I don't. No, it doesn't fit. None of the accounts hint at anything of the kind, and I know every inference. Why would she tell this friend and not her own family? It was early and she'd miscarried before, as we know. And... I recall a look Marcello gave her... a way with her-- I'd never seen it before with him. It makes sense now. That proves nothing. Andy, this is Michele, my sister from Paris. We have five high-ranking military from the junta already facing trial with direct evidence about Pinochet. So you see, we have been working very hard to ensure that Pinochet will face justice on his return home. - His immunity-- - His immunity is written into the constitution. We can't see that being dismantled in the runup to your elections. If Pinochet is not home before the elections there will be a huge right-wing backlash. We know your agenda and we're not unsympathetic, but unless we get an extradition order from you for Pinochet's trial in Chile, I'm afraid you can forget this line of argument. And so, if this thing were to drag on and Senator Pinochet were to die here, the British government has made him a martyr. Bravo. No one wants to see that, I assure you. Well, it's in your hands. You mentioned his health. Now... if the Home Secretary were made aware of any significant change in his condition, then there might be some room for maneuver. There is a way out of this maze. I think now is the time to consider mercy. Mercy? Your medical condition is a matter of record. Confinement has clearly taken its toll. A trampled sovereignty cannot be restored by acts of mercy! - Listen to him, Dada. This is a way to get-- - I will not! Chile has not abandoned us, you see. We will win! Not limp away! General, you are aware the court requires you to attend your extradition proceedings, and a medical examination could determine whether you are in any condition to attend court at this time. A fortnight ago, it was announced that General Pinochet had suffered two minor strokes, so the bench reserved for him at Bow Street Court was empty when the magistrate ruled that all the conditions were still in place for his extradition. The magistrate has ruled that Pinochet can be extradited on 35 new charges of torture, and that the Spanish courts can also consider whether the torment endured by the relatives of the disappeared in Chile should also constitute mental torture. We've had a request from the Chilean government to release Pinochet on health grounds. I've a medical report as long as your arm. Serious deterioration in health? - Fatal? - That's what they're saying, yes. Risk of possible cerebral hemorrhages. Look, Jonathan, I realize there is a-- a deal playing out here, but how do we present this? I can't just issue him with a sick note, can 1? We've established that health is the one and only way to intervene on this. Cheer up, Jack! Chile's giving us the safest way out of this mess. The Home Office is asking whether the general would be willing to submit to an independent medical examination. They are offering complete confidentiality-- But I did your medical tests, and now there's more! - What is all this? - If the British government is going to move on your behalf, General, they need to verify your condition with physical and psychiatric tests. What psychiatric tests? What is this? They need to consider if the general is fit to stand trial, madam, not simply fit to stand up. Are you trying to suggest the general is losing his mind? I suggest nothing, madam. We are merely trying to keep your husband out of a Spanish courtroom. I know exactly what you are doing! You little fucker! From one trap into another, hey? How dare you try to take me down? You see the face of this new Chile? Fuck! With this 1 go home, yes. But as a shell of myself, certified, as good as in a box! Convenient for you all! You little creeping cunts! General, you have been kept in this place for too long. You are a sick man. You take this cocksucker and get out of my sight. The woman who told you about Jacqueline-- I'll need to get a proper account. Of course. She would have lost the baby straightaway. She could have coped with that loss if she'd lived. She could have come through anything. We've come to see Russ Abbott. Shh-shh. Who is Russ Abbott? If I can't get to see Pinochet, he can hear from me at least. I'm taking extended leave, General-- my wedding, if you recall. Oh, my dear, you're getting married? This husband of yours, would I approve? He's a policeman. We talked about it. Oh, well, when you come back, you must bring him. But when I get back you'll be gone, won't you? To Spain. I think, General, this might be it, you know, the end of the-- I just-- I wanted to say good luck. We'll submit to all their tests. The British government has made it clear what they need to obtain your release. You have medical supervision, General, which you must follow at all times. Here. I don't need to remind you whose cameras are watching you. Dada, where have you been? I've been outside, and I found this. Oh, it's Antonio's from Christmas. What a shame. Antonio's? Dada... you will do this thing? My God, perform for them? Perform? Yes, we will give a performance. I'm going to say three words to you and I'd like you to repeat them back at me. Cat. Glove. Rose. Cat. Glove. Rose. Can you tell me where we are? We are... in your office. - Where is my office? - If you don't know that, I... I'm not the one to tell you. And can you tell me which country? Great Britain. I'd like to turn your wrist like that, and the other one like that. I'd like to show you this picture of a family. In this picture, can you tell me which member of the family is missing? Nobody disappeared. And where is the family? At-- at home. Stick out your tongue. As far as you can. I'd like you to take away seven from 100 and keep on taking away seven. 93. 86. 79. 73. Uh... 66. In this picture, can you tell me which of the family is missing? The boy. In the sea. I gave you three words to remember. Can you tell me what they were? Cats, glove, roses. It is our view that Senator Pinochet would not at present be mentally capable of meaningful participation in a trial. He would be unable to follow the process of a trial sufficiently to instruct counsel. He would have difficulty with the content and implications of questions put to him, and would have inadequate insight into this difficulty. His memory of remote events is impaired. "We are satisfied that these impediments are due to brain damage. We consider any significant improvement to be unlikely.” And the psychologist concludes that there is no evidence that the general is attempting to fake disability. So it cannot be disputed. In the circumstances, I am minded to take the view that no purpose would be served by continuing the present extradition proceedings and that I should therefore decide not to extradite Senator Pinochet. We're finished, Nicole. - This is it. - What are you talking about? There's 70,000 signatures here demanding more medical tests. We can challenge until we're blue in the face. It doesn't matter. It doesn't make any difference. They don't have to listen. Straw's now in a position to make a political decision and that's what this is, pure and simple. This is it-- end of the line. Hello, General. So what's he up to then? Is he really ill? The time has finally come, Mr. Caplan. Unless you have any more surprises for us? Let's hope not, madam. Has the general made his holiday plans for next year? I think the southern hemisphere would be wise. Still here, I see. Nothing better to do with their time. Let's go straight to R.A.F. Waddington in Lincolnshire where that Chilean Air Force Boeing 707 with General Pinochet on board is now taxiing slowly to its takeoff point. So it's your impression that takeoff is, if not imminent, in the next little while? Well, I think it actually could be imminent. The airport is... There seems to be a delay. They haven't gone yet. They're waiting for you in the Commons. Well, I can't go now. I'll miss this. No, they're waiting for your announcement to start in the Commons before they take off. Oh, yes, of course you're right. There it is-- not very good weather conditions. They're clearly, and this diplomatic, political and legal tussle, which has involved some half a dozen countries and which has lasted 16 1/2 months, is now coming to an end. At Santiago Airport, Chile's service chiefs waited to embrace the former dictator as returning hero, ignoring the past 10 years of civilian democracy. General Pinochet immediately scorned the wheelchair. The General, considered too ill to stand trial in Europe, walked unaided.
