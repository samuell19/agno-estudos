(COWS MOOING) (BEEP) (EXPLOSION) Good to see you, Billy. -How was your trip? -It was great. I was kind of long though. Yeah, I'll bet. Let's go. BILLY: How's my horse? How's Rascal? And how's Cruza? Can I get a new pair of boots? -And some overalls? -(LAUGHING) You sure can ask questions. Hola! -Sh, he's asleep. -Boys will sleep through anything, you know that. -Hi there, strapping fellow. -I'm awake. -Where's Rascal? I wanna see Rascal. -In the morning. -But I'm not tired. -In the morning. -And you're gonna sleep and see Rascal in the morning. -Mhm. In the morning... -Help me up. -Here we go. Ok, up. -They've been doing something else too. -What's that? -Explosions. -Explosions? Lots of little explosions. Big funny truck. -Close to the Box-V? -Across the road. Close enough so they could talk to me. They had some things to say about the Mexican in me. -Well, I'll put a stop to that. -You don't have to. I had some things to say about the white in them. -I'll bet you did. -Up. -Hi, hombre. -Hi, Cruza. -Cruza, you're the best. -The best what? I don't know, uh... housekeeper. Housekeeper? I quit. -Ranch hand? -Foreman. -Best foremen I've ever had. -Well that's because I'm the only one left you've got. Me and Bill Vogelin-Starr. What more could a man want? Hey! You gonna sleep forever? Get the lead out. -Buenos dias. -Good morning. Good morning, Grandpa. Hm, you gonna eat forever? You going to take forever? (HORSE NEIGHING) Grandpa, wait up! Wait up! Is that a jack rabbit? Is that? -And what's that? -More fence, wire, signs. The army's getting even closer, building their missile sites, soldiers everywhere. They're practically all over New Mexico, Billy. BILLY: Isn't Rascal wonderful? His buckskin color -his broom tail, his... -Even if he is scatter-brained... -Rascal isn't scatter-brained. -Always tryin' to run away. The animals up the mountain would love to feast on his bones. The mountain, we're going up there? Thief's Mountain. I'm not sure your mother ever liked it around here, Billy. Maybe if there had been boys. Your grandmother, she came here and took one look at this mountain and me, and said, "Vogelin, I'm gonna set you straight." And she did. You never brought me up here last summer. -Look at that. -Last summer, you were a tenderfoot. Now you're ready to see the one place they still leave alone. To see the way it should be. Grandpa, Grandpa! -Grandpa, it's a... -An eyesore? No, it's a... No fences, no signs. I loved this old tree. I was gonna save it. Build around it. Now I can't even move it. Show you what I know. -You wanna try? -Yes, sir. BILLY: I give up, I hate this tree. -Need some help? -Who are you? -My name's Lee Mackie. Well my name's Billy Vogelin-Starr, and you're on my grandfather's property. Don't you know this is Thief's Mountain? This is Thief's Mountain, but the government owns this property. -Grandfather... -They've owned it as long as I can remember. Longer. Well, the government claims to own it, but they ignore it. I live on it, and I love it. (EXPLOSION) (HORSES NEIGHING) Don't see be ignoring it any longer. They do up here still. I remember you, Lee Mackie. When you were Billy's age. Your father didn't stay around here long enough to do much. He didn't stay around anywhere long enough to do much. -He wasn't much of a landowner. -He wasn't much of a father. All I ever got was that speck on the far side of the mountain. That was after he died. Thought I better come back here and check it out. You got a predicament. Mind if I borrow this piece of equipment here, boss? -What's that, Grandpa? -Good! Now, here comes the easy part. All we have to do now is shove it off the roof. You ready? Sure. Ready? (STRAINING) Stubborn little devil, isn't he? You know, I got an idea. I figure, if we take the ax and cut right through here, we'll be able to move it. (ALL LAUGHING) (LOW RUMBLE) -Hey Grandpa, what's that? -Billy, go check the horses. (HORSES NEIGHING) Yeah. That's the government. They keep snortin' and -snoopin' around my land... -Grandpa! Lee! -The horses are gone! -That's alright, they can't have gone far. We'll find 'em. -Do you think Rascal will be okay? -Yeah, I think so. We better split up, spread out a little bit. Careful, there's a drop-off about 50 yards down here. Watch your footing. (HORSE NEIGHING) (HORSE GRUNT) (HORSE NEIGHING) Hey! Over here! I found him! Damn. -He's hurt. -It's Rascal. His leg, it's broken. We'll he'll be alright, won't he? -We're gonna have to put him down. -No! That's the only thing to do. Easy. Stand back now. (COCKS GUN) (GUNSHOT) Hey. You gonna sleep all day? Get the lead out. Couldn't we bury him? Six inches down and it would be like we were hittin' concrete. I ain't much with words. Never learned the Bible. Hell, I never understood it. But Rascal here, he was a dumb one. Stupid as they come. And scatter-brained. He was a good horse. Bye, old horse. Rest well. I gotta go. No, you can't just leave my property without some thanks -and little bit of food. -Yeah, it's better if I go. -You gotta eat. -Gotta take off. Where's Rascal? Rascal's...dead. -Aye pobrecito. -My ranch. Bloodied drag strip, that's what it is. Now a fireworks factory, a bombing range. -You think they can scare me? -Their mistake. Lee Mackie, he won't stay and eat your food. His mistake. Lee Mackie, get in here. You're staying. Once you put it that way... Look out, she runs my life. No peace. Drives me crazy. But I couldn't live without her. Take some steak. No beef? You know what happens to cowboys that don't eat? They get so skinny, that one day their boots don't fit, and a big wind comes along, and they're gone with the tumbleweed. Who's gonna wash the dishes? Senor Starr, thanks for volunteering. I'll water the horses. Great, you can water the horses and wash the dishes. I'll wash the dishes in the same water trough as the horses. You'll do no such thing. (LAUGHING) Okay. Us real cowboys always wash our dishes in the sand, anyway. -You lose, Cruza. The boy whopped ya. -I'll wash the dishes. His second mistake. Well since you put it that way, Senorita Cruza , get in there, you're helpin'. Anybody home? (CLEARS THROAT) -Oh, Mr. Vogelin. -That's me. And that's Mr. Starr I am Colonel Everette Stone Desalius. -I suppose you know why I'm here. -Nope. I thought I'd deliver this personally. See, it's uh... It's a Declaration of Taking with an order of immediate entry from the U.S. District Courts. -Judge Fegrerin presiding. The um... -You speak English? The Declaration of Taking authorizes the Attorney General of the United States to proceed at once in taking possession of your property. My ranch is not for sale. It's because you refuse to sell or negotiate that we had to proceed. My ranch is not for sale. But, legally speaking, your ranch has already been sold. See, we deposited a check payable to you for $95,000, an estimated value of your land and improvements. Mr. Vogelin, I have the authority to make one final offer. Mr. Vogelin, $105,000. 105,000 is too much. This place isn't worth... -75,000. -Oh. You know, they told me you were a difficult customer, but (CHUCKLES) I thought you might at least be willing to listen to reason. I haven't heard any reasons yet. Don't you see that you and I are now enjoying our ease on United States government property? This isn't property, Colonel. This is my home. Well, Mr. Vogelin, this is a civilized country. It's not a jungle. Go to courts. I don't think you're gonna do any good, but you can try. I've enjoyed our conversation. It was nice to meet you. Both of you. What do you think, Billy? Pretty nice guy. Wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw a horse. We think the same, Billy. We think the same. Couple of letters here from the government here, Mr. Vogelin. Well that one's from the core of engineers. -And that's the one from the district court. -You read 'em? Mr. Vogelin, how can you say that? Oh somebody might as well, it's not gonna be me. That's better. Now you're beginning to look like a cowboy. How 'bout a beer? I got it at last. The title of my next masterpiece. -The end of the world, full size. -You mean Hell? No, before that. Hell is just opening up. And the holy rollers is rollin'. And there's devils. And yellin' and moanin' and prostration everywhere, and there's -and there's spiders... -Sounds like you got a lot of movement and grandeur in it. Well, I want it to have impact. Make a statement. Tell me, could you paint a picture of the government? -Major subject. -Make sure it's got a lot of signs in it. No trespassing, no hunting, no fishing, no parking. Blow your nose, zip your fly, get lost, drop dead. Lot of signs. Government loves signs. Damn civilization. I hear they want your land. Hayduke not only reads my mail, he also talks about it. -What are you gonna do? -Do? I'm gonna drink my drink, that's what I'm gonna do. How's the root beer? Looks like your painting made some impact. (BUZZER) (EXPLOSION) (MULTIPLE EXPLOSIONS) (EXPLOSION) Where's Colonel Desalius? On his way to Alma Ricardo. He's never around here. Who's in charge around here? I am. I'm Major Parrell, what can I do for you? -My name's Lee Mackie. -Oh yeah, Mackie, how you doin'? I'd be better if you gave John Vogelin some time. We've given him some time, and some more time. Give him ten days. Look, Mackie, in 24 hours, the seismic testing will get to his, I should say our, property line. -When's it get to mine? -You got your ten days. -Give him Christmas. -Oh yeah. I forgot about Christmas. No, see we... We've gotta overcome position uncertainty now. We can't lay any roads for the mobile missile if there's bedrock. The high rattle factor in case of enemy attack would destroy even the even the concrete bunker holding the mobile. I can't do it. You don't give it to him, I won't sell to you either. Yes, sir, you do what you want. It's not in my hands. What do you want anyways? A slice the size of my thumbnail? You keep it. We'll just get Judge Fegrerin to give us a variance, so we can cross it at will. -You forget about the Trapnel property. -What? -Haggard property. -What about them? -I bought 'em both. -Well you can't do that, we're takin' them too. Then you're gonna have to take 'em from me. (MAJ. PARRELL LAUGHS) -No, we offer top dollar, you're gonna lose money. -I'll make money. -You'll raise your price. -Yes, sir, I sure don't understand you you people. This is our national defense. -This is serious business. -This is big business. You know it. I know it. We don't want to keep the "Benited States of America" waiting. You raised his offer. Now raise mine. You get Desalius to do that. You give him Christmas. You do that, I'll get him out of there. Mr. Vogelin? How are things going? It'd be going a lot better if you got out of my way, Marshall. My name's Burr. The judge and the defense department just sent me over here to see how you're getting' along. Well, Mr. Vogelin, this here paper is an extension of your order to vacate. I guess you know you're supposed to be off these premises. Vacate? No such thing. I'm not leavin'. I guess the judge or that Colonel Desalius figured you'd still be around, and this paper gives you ten more days. I don't accept. I never agreed to ten more days. -Well, didn't the Colonel bring some papers? -Papers. Is that all you do? Write, send, deliver papers? I don't want your papers. Oh, another thing, Mr. Vogelin. About your livestock. Now, if you don't want to remove them, we can remove them for you. Take 'em down to El Paso and have the auctioned off. Whatever they bring in, you'll get to keep, of course. Minus the expenses. I'm gonna ask you, and I don't want to ask you again. Get off my land. Yes, sir. I'll leave this with you. (ENGINE REVVING) -Anymore questions before I leave, sir? -Yeah. How many men are you gonna bring with you next time? Well, how many men you think I'm gonna need? Better round up all you can get. Ah Mr. Vogelin, don't threaten an officer of the law. You're trespassing on private property. LEE: When do you really expect to quit your testing? What are you actually gonna build out there? PARRELL: Well, we're just about finished with the seismic testing now. LEE: And you closed all your deals with the other landowners in the area? Just let us worry about that. That's our problem. -The appropriations are in, we're ready to go. -I don't care what appropriations have been made. I don't care how much money you have. You're not gonna build anything until you own all that land. So I don't see why you're pressing Vogelin so hard now. Just a minute, we've done our part. Colonel Desalius has arranged for Vogelin to have an extension. So now I think it's your turn. How'd it go? Well, I gave him the papers and he threw them out the window of his truck. He what? He threw them out his window. Ten days. -You really think you're gonna need his land in ten days? -Yes, sir. Because of the urgency of the matter involved. National security. I'll see what I can do. A horse like a cloud. A woman astride it. Comely limbs, invitin' flesh. No clothes. A smile. Beckoning. The cowboy's dream. Got a lot of impact, the statement there. -Movement and grandeur? -That too. -I love paintin' -You've got a gift alright. You're not in jail yet? Haven't they thrown away the key? -They want a war, they're gonna get one. -Is he ornery? Is he stubborn? Is he wrongheaded? Brain's full of sand. Head's screwed on backwards. -Every man has his faults. -It's just a piece of land. Don't say that. Don't ever say that. They got the papers and the law. The got acts of congress. National emergency. Eminent domain. Right of condemnation. Declaration of Taking. -What have you got? -I got the earth. The soil. The sweat. -My home. -I'll paint it. The battle of Box-V. A single man against a lot of tanks and choppers and jets and and arms and munitions. -All the magnificents of progress. -(SCOFFS) Progress... Your refrigerator, pick-up truck, disposable toothbrush. There's the only progress of modern man. -You're an anachronism. -I don't know about that. I don't know what that means. But I know what it means to be on my land, Thief's Mountain. At Jack Nab cabin. That's as close to heaven as I ever wanna get. -You can bury me up there. -You'd need dynamite to do that. Here lies John Vogelin, born 40 years too late, -died 40 years too soon. -40 years too soon? Yeah, I figure civilization will fall apart in about 40 years, and everything will go back to normal. Wish I could be alive to see that. And then you'd be right back where you started from. Hell, I'd like that. And I'd like my daughter to see, and I'd, uh, like my son, if I had one. I'd like him to see it too. -Didn't you ever want to get ahead? -No, I'd rather stay behind. I already got ahead. I think you already got a behind where your head oughtta be. Every man has his faults. Well, Billy, what'd your mother have to say? -Not that much, just a... -Let me see. Well, well... -Dear sweetikins... -Can I read it? Dear William, I have sent your presents, and they should arrive before Christmas. We will miss you, but we are glad that you'll be with your grandfather. At least there's someone who could put up that ornery, stubborn, wrong-headed jack nab. As for Lee Mackie, he doesn't sound so wonderful. Sounds like his brains are full of sand. Head screwed on backwards. You are a wonderful boy to stand those two diphthongs. Your sister and I send our love to you, you little, I mean, you big, bright, handsome man. Merry Christmas. Billy, you're some jack nab kid. A hat! Who gave me this? That's alright, Billy. You'll grow into it. (CHRISTMAS CHATTER) -You can never have enough handkerchiefs. -You gotta have socks. -What's this? -Whoa! Okay? (LAUGHTER) Alright. CRUZA: Who's gonna say grace? Let's try again. Who's gonna say grace? -John Vogelin? -Oh, Cruza, you know I don't believe in this stuff. Lee Mackie? Grace... Grace who, is she good lookin'? Billy Starr. No, nope. -Thank you for volunteering. -Do I have to? Stop wriggling. Do it. Rubadub dub, thanks for the grub. Yay God. (LAUGHING) Cruza, the boy's whipped you again. (CRUZA LAUGHING) JOHN: Do you like skin? BILLY: Mhm. Here's some white meat and some skin. A little more for a growing boy. Aw, wait a minute. I forgot, I... I got you somethin'. You already gave me the bull horn. A commandant needs the proper equipment. This is just a stocking stuffer. -For me? -That's the one. It's beautiful. I saw you talking to those guys. Colonel Desilly and that Marshall Burrhead. I saw you the other day. I give you the gift and I get attacked. -You probably gave me the gift so you wouldn't get attacked. -Not even thanks. -Well what were you doing with them? -I have the right to talk to anyone. -I have land to sell to... -To sell. I got them to let that old man be here for Christmas. Well what was it, a condition of your sale? Not even thanks. You can keep the present, just give me my sanity back. I love that old man! -And I love that little boy. -I hate them, of course. Well you're the one who was talking to that Colonel Poop Deck. -You're as stubborn and ornery as he is. -Gracias. Thank you. Maybe we should... go...out Me? With you? Where? What do you have in mind? -Uh... -That's what I thought. God, you're a tough article. I first came to Box-V when I was Billy Starr's age to wash and iron shirts. My whole family worked for John and Belle Vogelin. You think I'm tough and he's tough? She was tough. They had a dozen people working for them, and this place then...danced. Now I still iron shirts, and I do the other dozens' work. I took a bus to El Paso and a plane to Dallas once. I was never coming back. I'm glad I went so I could come back. He took care of my family and now I take care of him. This is my home. Not this ground, but this land. That man. Where do you live? I'm a vagabond. Lived in eight different states. Five countries. Every Christmas somewhere else. -But you came back. -I heard what was happening. Saw an opportunity. -This is your home. -I don't have a home. I have an office. A tent. This car. A speck of land. But I never had enough money to buy a home. Buy, sell... -the way you talk. -I'm a speculator. I always wanted to be like my father, a speculator. Only I wanted to succeed at what he failed at so miserably. You came back. May I sit down? (SIGHS) What do you want, Desalius? Well, we're gonna concede your right to retain possession of this house. And access to it. And we're not gonna try to evict you. Technically and legally, the house will remain government property. See, we are ready to sign an agreement. In fact, I have the papers right here. Oh, there's one small condition. That you agree to leave these premises during test periods. I admit it might be a little inconvenient, but it's no small price to pay for the right to live in your own house. Well, you go to town anyway occasionally, huh? Mr. Vogelin, just sign right here down at the bottom. By the X here. We can conclude this... discussion. Son? I'm sure grateful for all you people have done for me. It's a very generous offer, Colonel. Well thank you. -No. -I beg your pardon? No. We're gonna let you stay here. Nobody's gonna "let me stay here." You know, we have been very patient with you. Very generous. This constitutes not only a violation of the law, but a willful and deliberate obstruction of the national defense effort. The government has no recourse but to fall back on the direct instruments of the law. "Direct instruments." You don't talk English. The government will take steps, sir, that you will understand. It's about time. -Did Desalius come to see you? -Desalius? Who's Desalius? That army guy. Well, he will. He'll come. (BEEPING) (EXPLOSION) (EXPLOSION) -I just want to be left alone, get my work done. -There's no choice. Pass the land on to my heirs. Your heirs? What heirs? Your daughters don't live here, John. -They got their own life, somewhere else. -I'll find an heir. BILLY: I'll be an heir. I'm an heir. There's a point where you compromise. Where practicality can have principle. Not right, not wrong, just the way it is. -And to start, where does it end? -You're defying the law. -The way I see it, they're defying the law. BILLY: That's right. -Quiet, boy. -A hundred years from now, when we're all dead and buried and forgotten, this land's still gonna be here. Same worthless parcel, only some other idiot of a thief will be stringin' tents around it, hollerin' that he owns it, that it belongs to him. -Tellin' everybody else to stay out. -Just as long as they're a Vogelin or a Starr. BILLY: Or a Mackie. -Quiet boy. Why don't you give in, Old Horse? Give in gracefully, like a gentleman. Let the generals make the idiots out of themselves. Givin' in is not traditional around here. Sometimes I wonder, Lee Mackie, just whose side you're on. -I'm on my side. -What side is that? I've fought for causes. And I believe. But what happened. What good did it do? Well, that was then, this is now. In the 80's, it's make money. All my father ever left me was that squidgy, midget speck of land. He was just another thief, why should I be any different? You love the mountain. I thought we were talkin' about you. Now we're talking about you, and your wrigglin'. Who's side? You stone-headed old man. Can't you see they're gonna come? -I can't stop 'em. -That's not the question. I'm sellin' my land. Nice to have known you, Lee Mackie. (ARMY MEN TALKING) What are you doing? You can't do this! The...the shed! What did you do with the shed? What did you do with the shed! What the hell do you think you're doing? Soldier, get over here and help me! We are under orders to remove all the cattle and horses from this property. -Can't do that! -You quit? You give up? -I never quit! For any... -You are under arrest! Get off my property. Let go of me! Let go of me! (SPEAKING SPANISH) Let go of me! Get off my property! What the hell is goin' on around here? We're loadin' up the cattle and the horses to take them off the land here... -Who's in charge? -I am. Who is all this? -We have to take all these cattle and horses off... -Where did they take Cruza? She's under arrest, sir. She's down in Meagam Shore. I'm Vogelin, get off my property. Oh hello there, Mr. Vogelin. How are you today, sir? What do you think you're doing here? Oh, we're roundin' up your cattle and horses and takin' 'em off the land. Those cattle are not for sale. -You knew I was gone? -Yes, sir. We were under orders. You know, Marshall Burr was here, but he's gone on ahead, and I've been left in charge. -So damn many of you people. -Yup. Where's Cruza? -Cruza Peralta? -I'm afraid I have to tell you, Mr. Vogelin, she's under arrest. -In fact, we had a little trouble with her. -She alright? -Yes, sir. -How many did it take? -How many? -Sir? Ah, you'd probably lie. I bet it took a number. -Let's go. -Sir, I can't let you by. Son, I'm gonna ride my horse to my stable, walk over to my house, check it out, use my bathroom, and then get into my pickup truck and go down and let an extraordinary woman out of jail. And then I'm coming back here. And I'm gonna stay. -Me too. -Him too. Let's go. Mr. Vogelin, stop. Mr. Vogelin, you are trespassing on United States government property. Let's move it out. Move it out! Come on! One pocketknife... Pretty good one too. One dollar... oh damn... A dollar and 85 cents... Where is she? We got her locked up in back 'till we can move her to El Paso. -One rattlesnake... -Alright, what happened? -One sourball... -What's the charge? Oh? About anything you can name. Assaulting a Marshall, disturbing the peace, resisting arrest. -What's it gonna take to get her out. -Oh, she's not going anywhere. -Let me see her. -I don't think so. Let me see her. One silver bracelet... What do I have to do, break into jail? Well, you're well on your way right now. Why don't you take him back there. For one minute. What's her name? What's her name? Leave us alone, okay? They really like you out there. -They can go. -You alright? -Of course I am. -Of course you are. They took my boots. I'm gonna get 'em back. I'm gonna get you out. How's John Vogelin? -I don't know. -You don't know? No, we uh... We went down the mountain separately. Go to him. Stay with him. It isn't... You see... Forget about me. Can't do that. -You need to be with him. OFFICER: Burr? -Marshall Burr, are you in here? -Yeah. I'll get you out of here. -Mackie, what are you doing here? -You let her go. -You let her go, or you set bail. -Now wait a minute. Marshall, what the hell is going on here? Major, we had some trouble out at the Box-V with that Mexican girl. -We had to arrest her. -How much? Now, wait a minute. That's not the way we wanted to handle this operation... -You didn't wait ten days. -We waited for Christmas. If you give me a couple of days, -I can get him out of there. -We don't have a couple of days. I gave you my land, you gave me your word. You sold your land, you got your price. You've got nothing to say here. Alright. Where's my money? Colonel Desalius authorized me to pay you. I got a check right here. -What's bail? -Well, the judge usually sets bail according to my recommendations. -How much is it likely to be? -25,000. -Oh, come off it. -Now it's 50,000. -What? -Now it's 75,000! Apply this. Okay, Gene, let her go. I want the boots. Listen, I'm sorry. I got the boots. -Let's get out of here. -I'm not going. -What do you mean, "you're not going?" -Not with you. You're horse filth. You mung . You're free to go, you know. My father... worked, fought all his life and died here. My mother died here. My wife died here. And now we're going to settle this. Under the trees. We'll leave this mountain. William Vogelin-Starr. You made a great partner. A great son. -Now you're going home. -I'm not gonna go. -You will take him to Baker... -I won't take him. BILLY: I won't go. -You will go to a house that I found for you, and you will stay there. I am still the jack nab boss around here, damnit. Well, you gonna take forever? Mr. Starr? You know... Get him out of here. Now give me my bag. I love you. Hey, what are you doing? Come back here! Hey you! (KNOCKING) Mackie, are you in there? Come on, wake up! I thought you were in jail. I'm only here because we have to find Billy Starr. Well back out, about 20 paces. John Vogelin kicked us out. He had me take Billy to the and Billy jumped off? -Why? Didn't Desalius come? -Yes, he came. He turned down that offer? -Of course he did, how could you leave him like that? -Me? -You old buzzard. -What is this place? This is what you asked about, as much as there is. No place like it. Home. That's horse filth. This is no home. I've been your real estate magnet. A robber baron. Lots of desks, lots of employees. Lots of money. -I guess we're gonna be a damn boon town. I thought. -What happened? Like father like son. That's horse filth. That's... I could just stand here all night listening to your insults. We have a boy to find. And an old man to look after. -You go to him. -I can't, they have the place guarded. Barricaded. (SIGHS) Okay, the boy first. I'll look on the road toward El Paso. You look between Baker and the ranch. Vamos. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Billy, come over here! You can't stop me! I gotta find my grandpa! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Let me go. If you wanna help him, you'll go with me. Get your hat. Let's go. -Get out of my way. -Look who we've got here. Just where do you think you're goin'? Hey man, just hang tight until we find out what's going on here. Major this ain't gonna work. He's not gonna listen to you. Look, this is a government operation. I wanna do this without any trouble if we can. Just like you been doing? -I'm gonna try, Marshall. -Be my guest. Who are you? -I'm Major Parrell, sir. -Another one? I don't know him. Mr. Vogelin, you're just making trouble for yourself. There's no talkin', Major. Stop right there. Mr. Vogelin, we want to give you a last chance to leave peaceably. We don't want to use force. You know my answer to that. Tell the Marshall, his men, -to start shootin'. -For God's sake, listen to reason. You got my answer. Now get your people off my land. Sir, I can't do that. Come on, then. I told you're gonna have trouble with him. Alright, it's all yours. Dean, bring me the ax. (COCKS GUN) Okay, men, let's take cover here. Come on, get behind those jeeps. (GUN SHOT) (MEN SHOUTING) Get down! Marshall, wait. Gene, go get the tear gas grenades! Get ready! Billy, move out. I want a man right on the shed! Scully, get behind that shed. (RADIO CHATTER) Get a man up on that roof! Okay, let's try and put a couple into one of them shutters. Ready, fire! Billy, just stay in the car. -Can we get through? -As we've been tellin' her, you can't get through. Okay, we gotta smoke him out of there. Put one down the chimney! Ready, fire! (GLASS BREAKING) Mr. Vogelin, don't try to hold out! Mr. Vogelin, don't breathe that stuff. Come on out, we'll hold out fire. This is too much. We got three of 'em. One big cowboy, one little cowboy, and one Mexican jumping bean. Yeah. This it? Is this what you want? You'll lose. Take your hand away real slow. Get in the jeep. Hold it! Billy, get in the truck. Move! Get going. Get to him. (COUGHING) (GUN SHOT) Alright, boys, it's time to put some rounds in there. Blow him out of there. Ready? Open up! What the hell's going on? Grandfather! (YELLING) (GUNSHOTS) (CAR HONKING) (HONKING) Hold your fire! What are you doing? I'm coming in, Old Horse. Don't try and stop me. It's time to quit. I won't have this happen. (GUN COCKS) Stand back, Lee Mackie. Stand back! I'm not stoppin'. Go ahead and shoot. (GUN SHOT) Stop, Lee Mackie! Stop now! Do it, Old Horse. Go ahead, shoot. (GUN SHOT) Next time, Lee. Next time. You touch my house, and I'll kill you. Here I am. Here I am. (SOBBING) You dirty trick. -I'm leaving you, Billy. -I'll come too. No. Not this time. Don't tell anybody. Not Cruza, not Lee. Nobody. -Promise? -I won't I won't ever say anything to Lee Mackie again, ever. He's an ornery, stubborn, son of a jack nab alright. Brain full of sand. Head screwed on backwards. Do you hate Lee Mackie? He did what he thought was right. That's what you do. I'm proud of him. I'm proud of you, Mr. William Vogelin-Starr. Pick up the horses. -How's he doin'? -He's fine. -Where is he? -I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Is he inside? He go to town? What? -Hi. -Where is he? I don't know. What's going on? I think you're the biggest liars who ever hit New Mexico. I think I'm gonna take a ride out to the ranch. -Let him go. -They'll kill him this time. Let him go. I can't. Your third mistake. Lee, can I go with you? You gonna take forever, then? Lee, Billy Starr, you tell that old man... You tell him, (SPEAKING SPANISH) I, uh... I'll be back. Probably my fourth mistake. Your first correct move. -Billy, get the horses. -Okay. -Whoa. -Whoa. John? He got that tree down. -John? -Grandpa? -John, are you alright? -Grandfather? Grandfather? Hey, come on. Wake up, Grandfather. Come on, wake up. What's wrong with him? -He's dead. -He's not dead. 73 years old, climbin' up this mountain... -He's not dead! -Choppin' down trees... -He's not dead! -He's a damn old fool! -He's not dead! -Why'd he have to do this? We gotta take him down. Can't leave him up here. Animals will tear him up. And besides, they, uh, they got funerals and undertakers now. That's the way they do things. He wants to be up here. I know. Alright. Alright, give me a hand. We're gonna launch him to the starts like a Viking. He'd like that. -His name's John Vogelin, isn't it? -Yes. Grandpa. (CRYING) Your grandfather, he didn't believe in much of that other. I'm not sure I do either. But he's where he wanted to be. The mountain. The mountain will take care of us. And you. And me. Rest well. Bye, Old Horse. Rest well.
