Come on boys, let's get to class. - Oh god! - Dillon. You're up next. - Okay. Travis. - Eosinophils are white blood cells that we all have in our bodies. Sometimes people have significantly elevated amounts of these eosinophils, which can lead to... - Travis! That was your second warning. Sorry, Dillon. - Recently, studies have come out that scientists are developing a new medicine that can help reduce the amount of eosinophils in asthma patients, therefore reducing the amount of asthma in a person's body.

Kind of unwind. I like that. - Yeah. - Your parents will be there, right? - Yeah, they're going to be there. - Seriously? - Yes. You want an invitation? I don't mind sending you one. - No, keep me out of this, okay. I don't need a part of that. Just be safe this weekend, all right. - Absolutely. Absolutely. Hey, I've always told people you're cool.

Your father had all the charisma though. All I got were these measly good looks. She chose the right brother though, I'll tell you that. I'm a better in law than I am a husband, just asked my exes.
