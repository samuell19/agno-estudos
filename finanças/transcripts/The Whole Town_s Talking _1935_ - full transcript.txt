SECRETARY 1: JG. Carpenter Corporation. Oh, yes. Yes. SECRETARY 2: Good morning, J.G. Carpenter Corporation. Good morning. Morning. No. No! Positively no. I should say not. - (INTERCOM BUZZING) - Not a ghost of a chance! (no audible dialogue) Oh, uh, yes, sir. Yes, sir, J.G. Now, get this, Seaver. The next one to come in late is to be fired. Why of course, JG.. Now, these time records show that there is only one employee without any marks against him, number 48. How long has he been with us? Eight years and never late. Say, that's the sort of people we want around here. Most decidedly, J.G. Let's raise his salary. Why, certainly, J.G. Most decidedly, of course. - Where's Jones? - He isn't in yet. - Why, it's half to 9:00. - Guess he's late. But that's impossible. Jones is never late. - Have you seen Jones? - Not this morning. - Have you? - No, I haven't. - He must be late. - Yes, he must be late. (LAUGHING) My goodness me, Jones! Of all people, Jones! (ALARM RINGING) (ALARM STOPS) Yeah. Good morning, Cymbaline. (SIGHING) Good morning, Hélo'l'se. (CHIRPING) Oh, I had a wonderful dream last night. And I could tell you about it, but you're much too young. (HUMMING) (WATER RUNNING) Ah, I wish that dream would come true someday. - But it won't, Hélo'l'se, will it? - (CAT MEWING) There, now. Take your time, Abelard. You'll get your breakfast. (HUMMING) (EXHALES) (SINGING INDISTINCTLY) (SPITS) (MUTTERS) - (MEWING) - (CHIRPING) Huh? Oh, yeah. Here you are. Okay, Abelard. Here. (SNAPS FINGERS) - ATTENDANT: Going up. - Excuse me, sir. (DINGS) Jones! Go ahead, Jones. I'm waiting. Well, Mr. Seaver, I... I bought a new alarm clock last week. It carried a five-year guarantee. And this morning, it went back on me. You went back on me, Jones. You've placed me in a very difficult position. This morning, J.G. instructed me to raise your salary. Oh, he did? Oh, thank you, Mr. Seaver. (LAUGHING) Yes. But he also gave me instructions to fire the next employee who came in late. - Oh. - And you're both people, Jones. Now, what am I going to do? I can't raise your salary and then fire you. - That wouldn't make sense, would it? - Uh, no, sir. It wouldn't. Oh, dear. Why do such things have to happen to me? All right, Jones. I'll figure something out. Yes, sir. You better get busy on that McIntyre account. - We're behind already. - Uh, yes, sir. (DINGS) Miss Clark! You're late, Miss Clark. Late? What for? Did something happen? I want to know why you see fit to step in at 9:30 this morning. Well, if you must know, it's because I saw fit to step out at 9:30 last night. Well, it might interest you to know that J.G. gave me orders to fire the first person who came in late, and... - That's me, I guess. - It most certainly is. Well, in that case, I quit. When do I go? Now? We don't fire people in the middle of the week. - You will stay till Saturday. - That's mighty big of you. - Good morning, Miss Clark. - Hiya, Jonesy. I'm not into anybody, Sam. Now, that's my idea of a boyfriend, he-man plus. If I only knew where he was. Sam. Sam, get a load of this. Look. Look, who is this? - Killer Mannion. - I know, but who else? - What do you mean, who else? - Look! Well, what do you know about that! Here, Charlie, come here. Come here, Charlie. (CHUCKLING) Look, look at this. (CHUCKLING) - You get it, huh? (LAUGHING) - Say, that's right. (LAUGHING) Come on, boys and girls. Come on. Stick 'em up! Hello, Killer. Who you figuring on rubbing out today, big boy? - (ALL CLAMORING) - That's why you're late! (ALL CLAMORING) I wish you'd leave me alone. I'm way behind on the... (STAMMERING) McIntyre account. Please. Sorry, Killer. We didn't mean any harm. You're aces with us, chief. Say, there's a couple of guys we'd like snuffed out. (ALL LAUGHING) Hear, hear! What's going on there? Get back to your desks, you people! SEAVER: Jones! Uh, yes, sir. I'll have the vegetable plate, as usual. Hello. Oh, Miss Clark. - Mind if I sit with you? - Oh, I'd be delighted. Well, I've been canned. Feel like celebrating. Oh, I'm fed up with that office anyway. Full of nuts. One of them's been annoying me for weeks. - Oh, yeah? - Sends me verses. "To Cymbaline." They're so sloppy, the guy's afraid to sign them. (STUTTERING) Operator. Police head... (CLEARS THROAT) Police headquarters. Please! Quick! It's an emergency! Yes! There are crooks in that office. - Crooks? - Yes. I brought a picture of myself down to the office to have framed. It cost me two bucks, and somebody swiped it. Well, imagine that. Hey, boy! Rush it. It's Mannion. - Make it snappy, it's Mannion. - Okay. Stand by. Calling all cars. Calling all cars. A girlfriend of mine's an air hostess. I might take a whirl at that. Or else hop a freighter. I've always wanted to go abroad. Yeah, so have I. You know, that's why I started to write. Jonesy! Don't tell me you're a writer. Oh, yeah. I've written a lot of stories. Say, I finished one yesterday about Egypt. - Egypt? - I've always been interested in Egypt. Shanghai, for instance. I've always wanted to go to Shanghai. Say, I've got a stamp from Shanghai. (BLOWING WHISTLE) (SIRENS WAILING) (SHOUTING) Say, what's that? A fire? I hope it's the J.G. Carpenter Company burning down. (CHUCKLING) Stick 'em up, Mannion! Stick 'em up, Mannion, and be quick about it. Wait. You're making a big mistake. Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. This man's name is not... Shut up! My name is not Mannion, it's Jones. I'm a member of the YMCA, gentlemen. I have my card right here. I'll show you. - (OFFICERS YELLING) - He's got a gun! Cuff him. Get him outta here. You two fellas look after that moll! (ALL CLAMORING) You've got the wrong man. - My name isn't Mannion, I tell you all... - Oh, we know your name. Wait a minute. Where is that young lady? - Never mind, she'll be taken care of. - I know, but... Oh! - I tell you, you've got the wrong man. - You're a pretty tough young fella, huh? (ALL CLAMORING) Hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it easy. - (HORNS HONKING) - (SIRENS WAILING) They're bringing Mannion's girl now. I'll get her life story later. Yes. Yes! Mannion's sweetheart! The DA isn't here yet. We'll get to Mannion later. No. No. They won't let us see him till the DA gets here. Don't worry. We'll get a story soon as he gets here. Who do I... (CLEARS THROAT) Who do I have to see about the reward? - What reward? - For the capture of Mannion. I saw him first and I telephoned the police. - You did? Hey, Bill! - Mm-hmm. - Shoot this guy. - No! He put the finger on Mannion. We got the guy who put the finger on Mannion. We got the guy who put the finger on Mannion. - Come on, now. - All right. Smile. Smile. (ALL CLAMORING) It was me that pulled the rod on him. - Detective Sergeant Michael F. Boyle. - And Howe. Detective Sergeant Patrick J. Howe. - Boyle! - And Howe! - The DA's comin'! - What? No, you can't come in. I can't tell anything till the DA gets here. Keep those guys out! All of them! You picked the wrong town, Mannion. You've got the wrong man, I tell you. I may look like Mannion, but I'm not Mannion. Back! My name is Jones. I work for the J.G. Carpenter Corporation. Sure. In Battle Creek you were a book agent. In Superior, Wisconsin, a preacher. Now you work for the JG. Carpenter Corporat'ron. I-I've been working for them for eight years. Gentlemen, I-I'm a member of the YMCA. Check it. Get your cameras ready! Here comes the District Attorney! (ALL CLAMORING) - Well, Mannion! - My name... - Good work, Mack. - Thanks, Chief. Checked out by the YMCA. - Find any Joneses there? - Yeah, 33. - Well, Mannion, we've got... - My name is not Mannion. It's Jones. (ALL LAUGHING) The only way to keep out of jail is to come clean with us. Now, who pulled that Bloomingdale Bank job? Was it your boyfriend? Who was in on it with him? - They just picked up Slugs Martin. - Okay, but that dame won't talk. Take it easy. The DA just got here. They're sweatin' him now. She has beautiful blue eyes, but they have a cold sinister look that mark her at once as a gangster's moll. It's no use playing gaga, Mannion. We've picked up Slugs Martin. Slugs Martin? Who's he? If you think you're going to gain anything by... - Uh, J.G. Carpenter is outside. - Show him in. - Who is it? - Oh, that's my boss. He'll identify me. (REPORTERS CLAMORING) Here he is, Mr. Spencer. What's the idea of dragging me down here without a word of explanation? I'm a very busy man. I'll only take a minute of your time, Mr. Carpenter. I just want you to identify somebody. Take a good look at this man. Do you know him? I never saw him in my life. But Mr. Carpenter, I've been working for you for eight years. - Says he works for you. - Well, maybe he does. We have a large office, employ over 100 clerks, and I... Wait a minute. He does look a bit familiar at that. SPENCER: Certainly. He would, if you read the papers this morning. Papers? Well, what's... Why... Why, it's Mannion. That's right. Killer Mannion. - Oh, but Mr. Carpenter... - Just a minute. What do you wanna stick to a guy like that for? He's got a dame in every town. Look how he ran out on that gal in Des Moines. He'll run out on you, too. Guys like that always do. Where do we change cars? If you wanna keep your nose clean, all you gotta do is open up. Turn state's evidence, and I personally guarantee you can beat the rap. I'll take cheese. Hey, Boyle, come here. (INAUDIBLE) (CHUCKLING) Well, baby, you'll be interested to know Mannion's just confessed. - No. - Right in there, this minute. Well, what do you think of that? Well, I guess the jig's up. Sure, it is. But not for you, kid. Not if you wanna play ball. Imagine that heel squealing. Yeah, and he says you drove the death car. He did? Lieutenant, I'll talk now. I'll tell everything. What do you wanna know? Well, about that Bloomingdale Bank stickup. It was Mannion, wasn't it? Yup. Mannion. What are you wasting Mr. Spencer's time for? Snap out of it. Quit kiddin'. Yes, but you're making a mistake. If you'd only call Mr. Seaver. Where does he live? At the YMCA, too? No, don't make me do it. You don't know Mannion. He broke jail just to get me. If I identify him... It's too late now, Slugs. He knows you ratted on him. You've got nothing to lose. Look, I can identify him through the door, can't I? - I don't want him to see me. - What's the matter? What you scared of? Ah, he can't hurt you. We frisked him. You don't know Mannion! He pulls guns out of his ears! - Don't make me do it! - Oh, we washed his ears! Now, come on! No, fellas! No, don't! OFFICER: Gangway! I tell you, DA, I don't know him. I've hardly... Come on. Come on. Well, go on. Hello, Mannion. My name is Jones. I guess mine is Mickey Mouse. So, you broke out to get me, huh? Well, I'm sorry to disappoint ya, Mannion, but you ain't got a chance. Now, you're sunk. You'll burn for this. And I know a lot of guys that ain't gonna cry. Me in particular. Why, ya dirty, double-crossing, yellow... How about that First National Bank in Harrisburg? That was Mannion. - And that Evanston job. - Mannion. - And that express company job in Peoria. - Mannion. Who do you think we are? What do you wanna do? Keep us here all night? Go on! The warden. - Hello, Warden. - Hello, Inspector. - Hello, Mack. - Hiya, Warden. Oh, there you are. Thought you'd get away, huh? I treat you like a human being, and he runs out on me. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what anybody's talking about. Well, you will before the night's over. You're gonna come clean with me or there won't be enough left of you to put in solitary. Come on now, Mannion. Who did it? Who helped you make that break? My name isn't Mannion, it's Jones. - The Farmers Trust job in Denver. - Mannion. - The mail car robbery in Colorado Springs. - Mannion. - Come on, tell him who did it! - Who helped you make that lam? Lam? What is a lam? - Oh, now, listen... - Wait a minute, Warden. What we want is positive identification. Are you sure he's Mannion? If that's not Mannion, you're not the District Attorney. That's it. That's enough. - Take him a away, boys. - Right. Oh, my goodness. I beg your pardon, sir. Would you please tell me - who I should see about the reward? - What? - Please. - Uptown? No. Hold on to that receiver! Gangway! I gotta see ya! I just got a flash in the office! - What about? - Mannion just robbed a bank uptown. - Huh? - You've been drinking. I know, but it happened. Just a few minutes ago. - You're crazy! - I know that too. But he just stuck up a bank! Must've been somebody else. That's what I told the officer, it couldn't happen. But it did. The cashier and several people identified him as Mannion positively, and the guy told him that he was Mannion. - But we got Mannion here. - Yeah. I can't help it. He just robbed a bank. - Get him! Get Mannion. Send him here. - But if Mannion just... That fellow we had in this room. Whoever it is, bring him back. Right. - The Guaranty Trust Company in Fresno. - Mannion. That Sacramento Steel Company payroll stickup. Mannion. Oh, pardon me. I wonder if you could tell me where to get the reward? I don't know. Where could I find Mr. Spencer? Mr. Spencer, oh. - I don't know. - Oh. I don't care what anybody says. He looks more like Mannion than Mannion does. Oh, my name isn't Jones, it's Mannion. I mean, it isn't "Jannion," it's "Mones." Oh, I don't know... It's Jones! Jones! That's what it is. Gentlemen, please. (REPORTERS CLAMORING) Uh, over here, please. Oh, Mr. Seaver. Please, what's my name? Who am I? - Jones! - ALL: Jones? What are you doing here? Oh, I don't know, Mr. Seaver. I don't know. Just a minute, boys. Let me through here, please. We just tracked down this man's fingerprints, DA. - Well? - There's something wrong. They're not Mannion's. I told you my name was Jones. I'll bet it is at that. Gangway! Look out! Gangway! Gangway! I beg your pardon, sir. Can you tell me where I... It ain't Mannion at all. It was a guy named Jones. What? You men are on 24-hour duty from now on, till we get Mannion! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) - Well, thank you, sir. - Forget it. Say. You haven't got a twin brother, have you? Oh, no, sir. I have no relations of any sort. Except my Aunt Agatha in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Jones. That McIntyre account you were working on... Oh, yes, the McIntyre. Mr. Spencer, I should be getting back to the office, really. Do you mind? That's all right. You're free to go. Get out. Oh, thank you, sir. - Come, Jones. - Yes, Mr. Seaver. Oh, uh, gentlemen, I'm sorry I caused you all this trouble. That's all right. Oh, wait! - He can't leave here. - Why not? He looks too much like Mannion. He'd be back here in 15 minutes. Every cop in the city is looking for him. That's right. What are we going to do? Hmm. Get me the Mannion file. Fingerprints, photographs. Everything they got. Bring 'em in. - Tell me it ain't true. - What ain't? I hear they got the wrong man in there. It ain't Mannion. - That's right. Somebody made a mistake. - Somebody? It was me made a mistake. My life wasn't worth a dollar before, it ain't worth a ruble now. Mannion's sure to get me. Well, what do you want me to do, order some crepes? You dragged me in here to identify him! You gotta protect me! Take care of me! Lock me up! Put me in jail! DA, he ought to leave the state. Oh, that's no good. The police are after Mannion all over the country. Then he's gotta leave the country. Oh, but gentlemen, my work at the office would... He has the McIntyre accounts to get up. DA, Slugs Martin just came in. He's afraid Mannion will get him now. Wants us to put him in jail. How about it? That's it. That's what we do with him, with this guy. - We'll stick him in the can. - On what charge? Drunk and disorderly, vagrancy. Anything as long as he's locked up. SPENCER: That's not a bad idea. Send him up to my place. I have a few spare cells. Oh, gentlemen, I-I hardly think that I could... What are we going to do about the McIntyre account? I can fix one of them up nice and home-like, with flowers and everything. - He can stay there till we get Mannion. - Gentlemen, I don't think that would... - I've got it! - Yeah? I'll give him a letter saying he is not Mannion. Then if he gets in trouble, he can flash it. - Sort of a passport, huh? - Yeah, that's the idea, a passport. I'll dictate it right now. Harry, get busy. Official stationary. "To whom it may concern. This is to testify that the holder of this letter, Mr..." (SNAPPING FINGERS) - Uh, Jones. - Jones. It's Arthur Ferguson Jones. - Yeah. "Mr. Arthur Ferguson Jones... - Yes, that's right. Is not to be molested by the police because of his resemblance to one Killer Mannion." Ah, come on, sister. (REPORTERS CLAMORING) DA, you got nothing to worry about. We got everything sorted... Mr. Jones, we owe you an apology. But anybody could have made the same mistake. This letter will keep you from being annoyed by the police. But you must keep it with you at all times. Yes, sir, I will. Thank you very much, sir. Oh, Miss Clark, are you all right? Never felt better in my life. Why, I've just come back from a cross-country sleigh ride. What is it, Boyle? What's wrong with you? I'm okay, DA. I just swallowed something. OFFICER: Newspaper men are getting impatient, DA. All right. Come along, Jones. We're holding up headlines. REPORTER: Hey, what's your name? Hey! Mr. Jones, the man who looks like Mannion, will now say a few words. Huh? Oh. Uh... (STUTTERING) My name is Jones. Yes, Arthur Ferguson Jones. I, uh... I was sitting in the restaurant having lunch when... Oh, he's fainted! Give him some air! Let's see the passport. Oh, it was terribly embarrassing. - Wasn't it, Miss Clark? - Not to me. Well, there was a person there by the name of Slugs Martin. - Do I... - Slugs Martin! My goodness! He wanted to poke my eyes out as I sat there, handcuffed. And if it weren't for the police, he'd have done it, too. Come, come, folks. The newspapers contain a full account, I believe. This won't help you to get out the McIntyre account, Jones. - How about little work, just for contrast. - Yes, sir, thank you. HG. wants to see you, Jonesy.. - Who? - J.G., the boss, in his office. - His private office? - Yeah, his private office. Oh, J.G. just sent for me. - Well, what are you worrying about? - But in his private office. - I've never been in his private office. - Oh, stop being scared. Oh, I'm responsible for all this fuss, and he might fire me. Just growl at him, Killer. You'll scare him to death. Oh, J.G., uh... Mr. Carpenter wants to see me in his... private office. I'm sorry, Jones. Come in, Jones. Jones, I want you to meet Mr. Healy, a friend of mine from the Record. Put her there, Killer. J.G.'s just been telling me about that marvelous publicity. Oh, Mr. Carpenter, believe me, I had no intention of getting the firm's name into this. I merely told the reporter... That's quite all right, Jones. Here, sit down. - Well, if you don't mind, I... - Come on. Sit down. Sit down. - Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. - Here. - Have a cigar. - Oh, I'm sorry, but I never... Have one. Good for ya. - Smoke it. - Oh, thank you, sir. That's the best cigar you can get. Say, Jones... I want to apologize for not identifying you this afternoon. Oh, Mr. Carpenter, my goodness, that was quite all right. That was a pretty tough ordeal you went through. I understand you fainted. Well, all those questions made me quite dizzy, sir. Well, that's understandable. I'd have been a wreck, myself. (CHUCKLING) Hey, look here. I understand you write. Uh, yes, sir. I do. On my own time, sir. Well, now, Jones, uh... Healy here has got an idea he wants to talk to you about. It's like this, Jonesy. The paper figures this is a good time to pull the life story of Mannion. I've got a hunch. Who's the best man in the world to write that story? Outside of Mannion himself? The man who looks like Mannion. Good idea, I thought. Bring in the name of the firm... - An inspiration! - Swell! But you-you... You mean you want me to write for the papers? Make a great story. Yes, but... Ah, I don't know anything about Mannion. (CHUCKLING) HEALY: Ah, you don't have to write the stuff yourself. All we want is permission to use your name. "Arthur Ferguson Jones. The man who looks like Mannion." Swell! Look, we'll run your picture in the paper every day together with Mannion's. That ought to run another 30 days, maybe longer. - Your moniker, your mug... - The name of the firm. On the front page of every paper, every day. - Think of that, Jonesy. Think of it! - Yeah! Think of it! Yes, sir, I will. I'll... I'll think of it. HEALY: Don't think too long, my boy. We've got to get started right away. The first installment starts tomorrow. The day after at the latest. Now, look... Aflne host you are, JG. Where do you keep W? Oh, I remember, in there. (CHUCKLING) Well, how do you like it? - Oh, smells nice. - (CHUCKLING) Oh. I'm sorry, sir, but I don't drink. Ah, come on! Snap out of it! We've all got our hair down. Come on, a toast! To the man that looks like Mannion. To the man who looks like Mannion. (GASPING) (COUGHING) (GASPING) (CHUCKLING) (CHUCKLING) Yeah. Poor Jonesy. - I hope he don't lose his job. - I hope he does. Best thing in the world for him. Listen to this. "Mr. Jones writes at night, hoping to storm the citadel of literary fame. He's written for years without any encouragement." (CHUCKLING) Can you imagine? Jonesy, an author? - (LAUGHING) - Yes, I can. I've always thought that rabbit had something. All he needs is courage. Say, tell me something, pal-sy. What do you think of this guy, Mannion? I'll tell you something, pal-sy. Mannion is a false alarm. Highly overrated. And that goes for all of those criminals. A criminal is as brave as his gun. You take his gun away and he's a coward, just like anybody else. - That's it! That's our first lead. - What? "Mannion False Alarm, Says Jones." Put it there, pal-sy. It's gonna be a sensation. Let's have another drink. Let's have a couple more drinks. This is an extra special occasion. (HEALY, JONES AND J.G. SINGING) V For it's always fair weather I' I When good fellows get together.” (CHEERING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) So hung, JG.. And so long, Healy, ol' boy, ol' boy, ol' boy, ol' boy, ol' boy! Jones! Hello, Seaver. Hey, you know something? A woman is only a woman. But, a good cigar... is a smoke. (CHUCKLING) Yeah. Hi, Cymbaline. Hey, you know what? You know, we've all misjudged J.G. Oh, he's a great man, Cymbaline. Heart of gold. Proud to work for old J.G. I'd die for J.G. - I'd die for J.G.'s company. - (CHUCKLING) I'd die for you. - Whoopee! - (LAUGHTER) Oh, uh, Seaver... I'm taking the afternoon off. - J.G.'s suggestion. - But, Jones, I don't... Oh, yes, Seaver. I forgot. You put Miss Clark back on the payroll. [3.633 orders]. - What? - You check with him. So long, slaves. I always told you that rabbit had something. Hello, Hélo'l'se. - (CHIRPING) - Attagirl. (CHUCKLES) Sing and the world sings with you. Yes, but only sing with respect, 'cause I'm gonna write the life of Mannion. (CHUCKLING) Yes, sir. I'm gonna show him up for what he is. The four-flusher. Just a moron with a gun in his hand. I'd like to meet that fellow. (SCOFFS) I'd go right up to him, and I'd say, "Why you great, big, yellow, blue..." All right, tough guy. Hand over. Come on, that letter the DA gave you. Come on. (SCOFFS) That's perfect. Now listen, buddy. We're gonna go 50-50 on this pass. You're gonna use it in the daytime and me at night. It's gonna come in mighty handy. That's why I dropped in to see ya. - Can you talk? - Yes, sir. Well, don't. If you know what's good for you, you won't open your trap about my bein' here. To nobody, understand? And don't get careless after I leave here. 'Cause if anything happens to me, one of my mob will take care of you. - You get that? - Yes. Okay. Now, just sit there. And don't let nobody come into this room. I got a little work to do, and... I'll be back in the morning. Come on. Don't worry, Hélo'l'se. Maybe he won't come back after all. Maybe it was all a dream. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) Why aren't you in bed? (STUTTERING) I couldn't sleep last night. Here's your passport. Two cops stopped me last night. Worked like a charm. Oh, uh, thank you. Now, here's the dope. All I wanna do is lay up here for a couple of days. Just long enough to take care of a rat by the name of Slugs Martin. Slugs Martin? You know, he wanted to gouge my eyes out yesterday. He did, huh? Well, he ain't gonna do anymore gouging when I get through with him. - (KNOCK AT DOOR) - What's that? It's the morning paper. - Pick it up. - Yes. Anything about me in it? Come on, now. Read it to me. It, uh... It says here you killed two guards last night. They lie. It was three. Go on, read it to me. "At midnight, yesterday, Public Enemy No. 1, Killer Mannion, cold-bloodedly slew two guards in a raid on the state armory. Accompanied by two of his men, Mannion surprised the guards at the armory." What's the matter? Oh, that's all there is. What? Oh, what are you talking about? Why, the whole front page is full of me. (SCOFFS) Hmm. So you're gonna write about me, huh? Well, I can get in touch with the newspaper office and call the whole thing off, Mr. Mannion. What for? It's okay with me. Only be careful of what you pull, that's all. Yes, sir. Go on, beat it now, will ya? I'm getting sleepy. Yes, sir. (EXHALES) - What time do you knock off? - At 5:00, sir. - Well, be here at 6:00, prompt. - Yes, sir. Bring the afternoon papers. Yes. The afternoon papers? You heard me. And don't you forget it. Yeah, and remember. One word out of you, and you're out like a light. - Yes. - Go on. Now, shove off. - Good morning, Jones. - Good morning, Jonesy. Good morning, Mr. Jones. - Hiya, there, Jonesy. - Hi, Jones. Hiya, Jonesy, how are ya? Good morning, Jonesy. Uh, this is Mr. Jones speaking. Uh, Mr. Arthur Ferguson Jones. Yes. Well, I... I want to talk to Mr. Healy. Yes, I must, immediately. My goodness. He's not? Well, will you have him call me the moment he comes in? Yes, it's very important. - Hiya, Front Page! You busy? - Yes, uh, sort of. What have you got there? Fan mail? Yes, the most extraordinary amount of letters. Well, how do you like that? First sign of success! - Can use a good secretary? - (PHONE RINGING) Oh, excuse me. This is a call I'm expecting. Uh, yes? Photographs? I'm sorry, but I have no photographs. Of all the ridiculous things, can you imagine such... Well, that's your public, Jonesy. You're becoming famous. Three of my girlfriends asked me to get pictures of you. I told them the kind of a caveman you were. I can feel that kiss yet. Why, I... I want to apologize for that, Miss Clark. What for? If it takes a few swigs to bring out that personality of yours, I'll buy you a case of Scotch. Oh, it wasn't the drinks. Something came over me, and I just couldn't help it. I'm glad you couldn't. It isn't every girl gets kissed by the man that looks like Mannion. At least, I hope it isn't. Well, I should say not. Thanks, Jonesy. Well, well, well. Good morning, Jones. I see your boyfriend was quite busy last night up at the armory. Say, I hope you didn't have anything to do with that. (CHUCKLING) No, sir. Hardly. You know, you were the topic of conversation all through dinner last night. Mrs. Carpenter wants to meet you. I promised her I'd have you up for dinner sometime soon. (STAMMERING) I'd love that, Sir. That's fine. I'll let you know when. Oh, say, I almost forgot. You know, that youngest son of mine wanted me to ask you for your autograph. Do you mind? - Sign your name there. - Oh. - You want me to... - Sure! There, that's fine, Jones. Thanks. - Have a smoke. - Thank you. So long, Jones. Jonesy, you sure are going places. Just think of it. An invitation to the boss' shack! Say, when those articles come out, there'll be no stopping you. How much are they paying you for them? Well, I don't know. Healy never said anything about it. Jonesy, you need a caretaker. And I think I'm elected. If you're afraid to talk to Healy, I'm not. Say, you can get enough out of this to take that trip to Shanghai. - Some more mail, Jonesy. And a telegram. - A tele... Telegram. - Oh, my goodness. - What is it? My Aunt Agatha from Bridgeport is coming in for a visit. - Well, what of it? - Yes, but I'm... I'm not in a position to have any visitors just now. Why aren't you? I haven't seen her for five years. Now, why should she want to come here now? I've got trouble enough without her. What's the matter with you? You haven't got a trouble in the world. But I have! The McIntyre account. I'd like to get it cleared up before the end of the year. Yes, sir. I wish you'd struggle through with it without the assistance of, uh, Miss Clark. - I get it. I can take a hint. - Yes. Has, uh, Mr. Healy come to the office yet? But I've simply got to talk to him. It's terribly important. Well, could you give me his home phone? I know, I know, but... but please, please let me have it. Yes, but I've been trying to get Mr. Healy since 9:30 this morning. Well, I must get in touch with him. It's a matter of life and death! Well, never mind, never mind. I'll come down to the office myself. CRIER 1: Extra! Paper! Read all about Mannion! By the man that looks like Mannion! Oi, paper! Extra! Paper! Oi, paper! CRIER 2: Paper! Paper! CRIER 1: Extra! Read all about it! Jonesy! Jonesy, I had to see you. I waited at the office for you to come back. Where were you? Well, I didn't feel well. I've been walking around all afternoon. Say, I went down to the docks. There was a freighter there leaving for Shanghai. Oh, how I wanted to get on that boat. After that story? Say, you'd be a fool to leave here now. I've read it, and it's marvelous. By the way, Healy was in to see you. I made a deal for you. He screamed murder at first, but finally, we got together. Listen to this. 250 bucks a week! I guess that trip to Shanghai is a cinch now, Jonesy. Here's the contract. I told him I'd get you to sign it tonight. - Thank you. - Oh, don't mention it. Always glad to serve a public enemy. Uh, what do you say we go up to your room and read it over? All right. Oh, no, no. - No, not upstairs. - Why not? Well, the... the landlady is very strict about it. Please, Mr. Jones. You can leave the door open. Oh, no, no. I'd rather not, if you don't mind. Here, I-I'll sign this tomorrow. Say, I want to thank you for everything you've done for me. I want you to know how much I appreciate it, no matter what happens to me. (KNOCKING) - Who is it? - It's Jones. - May I come in? - Come in. What the devil kept ya? I told you to be back here by 6:00, didn't I? Well, I-I'm sorry, sir, but I couldn't get here any sooner. When I say 6:00, I mean 6:00. Next time you hold me up, there'll only be one of us that looks like Mannion. There wasn't anyone here to see me? An old lady? No. Is that the afternoon papers? - Yes, sir. - Well, let's have it. Go on now, fix me some coffee. Hmm? Hey, Jonesy! Come here! "False alarm." You shot off a lot of steam, didn't ya? I'm a false alarm, am I? Oh, I didn't write it, sir. A man on the paper did it. I-I tried to stop him from printing it. Yeah, I guess a lot of guys think I'm a false alarm. Oh, no. Who's gonna write the rest of these articles? I'm supposed to, but I'll call the whole thing off. Oh, no, you won't. You're gonna write 'em all right. Only you're gonna write 'em my way. - Sit down. - Yes, sir. (SCOFFS) I'll show you. A false alarm, am I? Well, I'll slip you some dope that'll make their heads dizzy. Something nobody knows. Are you ready? - Yes, sir. - Okay. Now, just put down what I give you. Don't make up nothing from your own head. You say in here I'm as brave as the gun in my hand. All right, you listen to this. When I broke out of stir the other day, I had a gun, yeah. But it was a phony. That's the kind of a false alarm I am. You got that down? Yes, sir. Yeah, I put the turnkey out with my hands. Then when I made the turn to the corridor, it was jammed by a brace of "malokies." It was what? A pair of guards were soft-shoein' around. Don't ask no questions. Just put down what I give you. Yes, sir. Then I pull the phony get on 'em. Told 'em to stick up their mitts, and I grab their rods, and I made 'em step out ahead of me into the yard, like they was taking me to the warden's office. We passed a dozen other guards on our way out. I figured the whole thing out myself. There was only one guard I had in the bag, the one at the gate, but nobody knows... What are you making them things for? Why don't you put down what I give you? Well, this is shorthand writing. Hmm. Yeah, then when I gets out into the yard, one of the guys in front of me squawks and hotfoots it for the gate. Well, I let him have it with one of the heaters. - Heaters? - Shut up! Then I grabs the other guy, and I holds him in front of me. Just as I'm starting for the gate. By this time, the typewriters up on the walls are cutting loose, cranking away, and the air is as thick as dust with machine-gun bullets. Look at that article. This man Jones seems to know a whole lot about Mannion. If he's just a clerk, how did he get the information about the prison break? - He says here one of the guards was fixed. - Yeah. - How do you suppose he found that out? - That's what I'd like to know. I thought you and I were the only ones who knew about that. - You haven't been talking, have you? - Oh, Chief, you don't think that I'd... Of course, of course, but if you ask me, there's something queer about the whole business. Jones is at luncheon with Mr. Carpenter. Why? I don't know. Excuse me. Well, Mr. Chiseler. What do you expect to get for nothing today? Out of you, Miss Shylock, nothing. Where is Arthur Ferguson Jones? He won't be back this afternoon. Half day, Saturday. Is it anything important? - His first paycheck, that's all. - I'll take it. - You expect to see him? - Yeah. - When? - This afternoon. Okay, tell him I wanna see him as soon as possible. - There's something I wanna ask him. - What do you wanna know? Who's been helping him write those stories? What do you mean, who's been helping him? Where does a squirt like Jones get off writing all that juicy underworld lingo? From me, of course. You certainly have horned in yourself properly, haven't you? - What do you get out of him? - Nothing. Well, you can always do business with me. I'm only interested in Jones. One of my men ran into Jones this morning. He nearly plugged him before he could show him that paper. You know, Chief, same thing happened to us last night. Ran plumb into him. I'm telling you, he nearly got a bullet right through that passport. Thought sure we had Mannion. That guy Jones is getting in our hair. I wish he'd stay put. Well, it would make things simpler for us. You know, Washington wants us to shoot on sight. Now, how can we, with this fellow Jones running around? That's right. That's what holdin' us up. Well then, put him away. That's it! Get Jones. Boyle. - Yes, sir. - Get Jones. Yes, sir. Get Jones. Get Jones. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) - Who is it? - It's me. For heaven's sakes, Jonesy, if I'd thought you were gonna keep me waiting out there all night, I'd have brought a cot. Well, mystery of mysteries. I've finally made it. I actually am seeing how the other half lives. And it's just what I expected, Jonesy. Cozy, warm, old world. There's even a canary bird. Expresses your personality completely. - Well, I'm glad you like it. - Oh, it's adorable. And now, Mr. Jones, prepare yourself for the thrill of a lifetime. Your first paycheck. As an author, I mean. The magic carpet which will carry you to Shanghai and eternal ecstasy. Why, you thief, you. So it was you who stole my picture. Oh, Jonesy, you're cute. Why, Jonesy! (CHUCKLING) Well, I... Well... - I... I think I better be going. - Oh, no. - I just came up to bring you the check... - No, wait a minute. Stick around a while. No, I had better. The landlady's awfully strict about this sort of thing. I'll be seeing you at the office. Hmm? Nick! Harry! Get me the police department. Hurry. Hurry. Hello, police department? This is Miss Clark speaking. Listen, I know where Mannion... Mmm! The police are exceptionally trigger-conscious these days, Mr. Jones. But you can't very well blame them for that. That's why we want to place you under protective arrest. Well, yes, but I... I can't afford to lose my job at the office, Mr. Spencer. It's either your job or your life. Well, then there are those articles that I'm writing for the newspapers, you know. - You can write them up there. - Oh, but I can't. Why not? Well, there's, uh... There's my research. Research? - Yes. Well, what better place for research for the sort of stuff you're writing than prison? - Right, Mr. Mayor? - Right, that's true. This isn't a question of choice, Mr. Jones. This is a grave emergency. - That's true. - Quite right. Yes, gentlemen. Well, do you, uh... I-I'd like to go home first, if you don't mind. - What for? - I'd like to pack a bag, sir. Oh, certainly, certainly. Boyle and Howe will take you home. If you don't mind, I'd much rather... There's nothing to worry about, Mr. Jones. It's only for a short while. Mannion is practically in our hands. We've got a pretty good idea where he is. - You have? - Yes, we have. You bet we have. - What? You mean that you... - All right, boys, take Mr. Jones home. Oh, yes, sir. Well, thank you very kindly, gentlemen. Well, thank heavens, that's over. I think I'll go up with you. No, no, no, no, no. Please. - Why not? What's the matter? - Well, I'd rather you didn't. Oh, I get it. A dame, huh? - Yes. - (ALL LAUGHING) - Okay, kid, but make it snappy. - Yes, sir. - Huh? Oh. - (LAUGHING) You know, I got a hunch. I got a hunch that 25 grand is going to be copped by none other than Detective Sergeant Boyle. And Howe. Here's your gun, Mr. Mannion. You shouldn't leave it around like this. What'd you pick up this gun for? Why didn't you plug me when you had the chance? You were asleep. You can't shoot somebody who's sleeping. Why not? I'd have done it if I'd have been in your place. I'll tell you why you didn't do it. You're afraid of me. You're afraid of me, asleep or awake. - Yes, sir. - Yeah. (HORN HONKING) What's that? (HORN HONKING) Who is it? The police. Oh, they don't know you're here. They're waiting for me. For you? What for? They want to send me to prison so I'll be out of the way. Oh, I see. Well, they told me I had no choice in the matter. I had to go whether I wanted to or not. (WHISTLING) - (HORN HONKING) - (WHISTLING) Get over and wave to 'em. Hurry up! Tell 'em you'll be right down. I'll be right down. Hurry up and pack your grip. I don't want them dicks comin' up here. Yes, sir. What's the interest on 25 grand at 6%? Nah. You can't get 6% anymore. You're lucky to get 5%. 5%... 1,250 a year. That's not bad. Hey, what's he doin' up there? Packin' a trunk? Say, you don't suppose he's tryin' any funny business, do you? No, what's the percentage? You know, maybe I should've gone up with him at that, dame or no dame. I think I'll go up there and take a look. What kept you up there? I was just comin' up after ya. - I'm sorry. - Okay, hop in. Jonesy, when we get you safe up there in prison, it'll be a cinch to get Mannion. Yeah, sure. (CHUCKLING) Hey, uh... I'd like to stop on the way and phone if you don't mind. Okay, we'll stop someplace. - Thanks. - (ENGINE STARTING) Yeah. I'm on my way to the prison now. Couple of dicks are taking me up there. What? Well, Slugs Martin is up there, ain't he? That's what I've been waiting for, isn't it? Yeah. (CHUCKLING) Okay. Now you guys get hold of Jones and hold him. We'll take care of him later. Now snap into it. The boss just gave us a ring and told us to come up here. So get into your clothes, buddy. Well, uh... Mr. Mannion took my clothes. Haven't you got another suit? Yes, I... I have a gray two-button... Well, get into that. Yes, sir. I will. Right away, sir. Oh, uh... Could I offer you a cup of tea? Go on. Get dressed, will ya? Step it up. Yes, sir. Washington sent me down here to clean this thing up, and I'm going to do it. I tell you, the key to the whole situation is Jones. - Did you read that article? - Why, yes. It's about Mannion's prison break. Jones says that Mannion had one of the guards fixed. That's right. - Did you know that? - No. - Did you? - No. No one knew it except me and a couple of the men in my department. And we kept it a secret. Now how did Jones know it, is what I want to know. - Might have been a stab in the dark. - Oh, is that so? Read the article. It's written as if Jones had been an eyewitness to the break. Worse than that, as if he took part in it. Now, look here, Mr. Russell. Surely, you don't think... I don't think anything. There's something funny going on here, and I want to talk to Jones. - Get him down here right away. - Certainly. Get the warden up at the prison. (DIALING) There you are. We're having trouble with Slugs Martin. He don't want to wear the prison outfit. Why should he? He's not a prisoner here. He's here on his own volition. Well, he looks kind of funny running around the yard in his own clothes. (CHUCKLING) He'll look funny anywhere. That's tough. (PHONE RINGING) Hello. Yes. Yes, Mr. Spencer. I'll send Jones to town right away. Train leaves at 2:30. Okay. Where's Jones? In the visiting room, talking to a friend of his. A goofy lookin' guy by the name of Seaver. - Get Jones up here right away. - Okay, Chief. And I brought you something myself. - What's that? - The McIntyre account. Oh yeah, yeah. I know. Sure, of course, they... As long as you're on the payroll, you might as well do a little work. Goodness knows, you haven't been doing much work at the office lately, have you? No, I haven't. Well, you see, they've been... Warden wants to see you right away, Mr. Jones. Fine. Well, I'll be back and collect all these things. That's mighty swell of the gang. You give them... I'll be... Don't go away now. Jones has changed. Mr. Jones. There's something hot downtown. I just got a call from the district attorney. - He wants to see you right away. - Yes, sir. You're to take the next train. - That's 2:30. - Mm-hmm. I've arranged for one of the guards to take you to the station in an automobile. Yes, sir. Be at the prison gate at 2:00 sharp. - Yes, sir. Is that all? - That's all. Hey. Wait a minute. I don't know. You look more like Mannion than ever. Oh, get out. Beat it. (WHISTLE BLOWING) (ALL CHATTERING) - Oh, hello, Mr. Martin. - (GASPING) Now, don't make that mistake again. I'm Jones. Arthur Ferguson Jones, you remember me? - Oh, hello. - Hello. Hey, I've been trying to see you ever since I came here. What about? Mannion. Uh... You know, I've been writing articles about him for one of them papers. Oh, yeah? And I understand you're a very good friend of his. Who said I was? I never had any use for that coked-up rat. Oh, it's bad as all that, huh? Boy, say, listen, that guy would double-cross his own mother. Come on, let's take a little stroll where we can be by ourselves, hmm? Come on. You know Mannion don't mean a thing without the mob around him. Get him by himself, and he's as yellow as they make 'em. Is that so? Yeah. He was off of me because I had his number. He know he was slated for the skids. Yeah. (CHUCKLING) Now, he was a dirty, double-crossin' rat. He should've been rubbed out long ago. He was nothing but a skunk. He crossed everybody that ever strung with him. I'd like to meet him face to face. I'd get him. I'd just like to watch the yellow come right up. Why, the louse. Better hurry up, Mr. Jones. So long. So long. Ah, so long. I'll be seein' ya. (CHUCKLES) Oh, Jones! The warden just told me that you were going into town. He said it would be all right if the guard gave me a lift to the station. Oh, it's swell. (SIREN WAILING) What more do you want? You had the guy in your car, didn't ya? But we didn't know it was him, Chief. How could we? - He even had Jones's clothes on. - That's right! Alibi! You had the chance of a lifetime, and Mannion made a sucker out of you. - And Howe. - (PHONE RINGS) Yeah. And you said, if you ever got Mannion back to prison again, he'd rot before he ever got out. Well, you had him, and you let him walk out. - I still don't think it was Mannion. - No? Well then who killed Slugs Martin and the guard? Maybe it was Mannion. But you can't pass the buck to me, Spencer. You sent him up as Jones. - Phone, Mr. Spencer. - Yes? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. I'm the man who identified Mannion in the first place when he was Jones. I've been working on the case ever since, and I have a theory... Who is it? The same guy who's been calling me up all week. I can't get him out of my hair. Mr. Carpenter. Mr. Spencer, where is Seaver? - Who the devil is Seaver? - My office manager. He went to the prison to see Jones, and he hasn't been heard from since. Well, don't ask me, ask the warden. DA, I called to see that Clark girl this morning, see? - She wasn't home last night. - Well, what of it? - She's missing too. - Miss Clark? - Seaver? - (WHISTLING) Where's Jones? (ALL SHOUTING) I tell you, boss, this town's gettin' too hot for us. Let's get going while the going's good. Oh, there ain't a chance. They got every road covered. What are you gonna do? Hang around here until they come and get us. Leave it to me, will ya? I ain't steered you wrong yet, have I? (ALL SPEAKING) Now, just a minute. There's only one chance of our gettin' out of here. That's if they stop looking for Mannion. Yeah? But who says they're gonna stop? Say, if you was a copper, and you found Mannion dead, you'd stop looking for him, wouldn't you? - Yeah. - Yeah. Who's gonna croak you? Hey, you ain't thinkin' of bumping yourself off? Who, me? (CHUCKLING) Hey! Bring that guy Jones in here. Oh. (DOOR OPENING) Come on, Jonesy. Boss wants to see you. Ah! Thank you. Thank you. Oh! Just easy. Ah! Just easy, please. Oh! You mugs better beat it out of here. I'm going in on an act that's liable to break your hearts. I'm very much obliged to you, gentlemen. (GROANS) - Come on. Come on. Come on. - Oh! Ooh. (KNOCK AT DOOR) Come in. Sit down, Jonesy. Jonesy. I got good news for you. I'm letting you go. I'm sorry about dragging you down here, but I had to get into that prison just because Slugs Martin was there. He ain't there anymore. He ain't anywheres. I'm gonna try and lam out of town tonight. They'll probably get me. But not alive. Maybe the next story you'll write about me will be all about how I was croaked. I hope not, sir. - You can help me, Jonesy. - How? It's gonna be the last favor I'm ever gonna ask of you. I want you to take this money down to the First National Bank and put it in the safety deposit vault. And then when I'm croaked, I want you to take the money out and deliver it to my mother. You'll find her name and address in this envelope. I'd do this myself, only... one of the guards up at the prison nicked me in the head when I beat it out of there. You know, this wound would be a dead giveaway. - Will you do it for me, Jonesy? - Well... (CLEARS THROAT) Couldn't you get one of your own men to do this for you? One of my men? Which one? Why, there ain't no one of them in there that I can trust. My mother would never get this dough. And that's the one thing I'm trying to take care of before it's too late. Yes, but... but how could I do it? I'd be recognized as soon as I stepped out on the street. I'd never reach the bank. That's smart of ya. But I figured that out too myself. You can put on a disguise. Say, I've done it lots of times when I pull jobs. Here. Here, stick on this mustache. Go on now, try it. - What do you... Put it? - Put it on. How's it feel? (STUTTERING) Tickles a little. Oh, you'll get used to it. Hey, there's a mirror over there. Go on, have a look at yourself. - Don't be scared. - Yes, sir. My goodness. It does make a difference, doesn't it? (CHUCKLING) Why, certainly. Say, you'd never be known in a million years. - You got a poke? - A poke? - Yeah, a pocket book. - Oh, yes, sir. Well, put this in it. Uh, Mr. Mannion, I-I don't like to refuse you anything, but... You're not going to refuse me. Why, think of the old lady. She's alone and helpless. Have you got a mother? - No, sir. Yes, but I've got an Aunt Agatha in Bridgeport. I'm terribly worried about her. She's disappeared someplace. Oh, well. Aunts ain't the same as mothers. What do you say, buddy? Will you do it for me? - Yes, sir. - Now don't forget. First National Bank. And be sure and get there before it closes. Say, you better hurry up. There isn't much time left. Come on, shove off. Yes, sir. Gee, boss, you were great. You almost fooled me. Oh, never mind that. Never mind. Look here. - Get to a phone. Call up the police. - Me? Tell 'em you're one of Slugs Martin's men, sore about me knocking him off. So you're tipping them off that Mannion is on his way to the First National Bank to pull a stickup single-handed. Tell 'em he's got a mustache on. You know, the same disguise I had on for the Farmers Trust Bank in Denver. - I got it. - Well... That's that. (CHUCKLING) The minute Jones is bumped, the bars are down, and that's all we need. (CHUCKLING) - Hey. - Where're you going now? - Oh, I'm going down to Gert's. - Oh now, but listen... Shut up, will ya? She's only down the street. I'll be back in an hour. I know, boss, but with Jonesy on the spot, we gotta think of lamming out of town. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - You're the manager? - Yes. Killer Mannion's going to stick up this bank just at closing time. - Killer Mannion? - Yeah. We're taking charge. Now, we don't want anybody hurt. Get all your clerks and the people downstairs out of sight. - Hurry up. - Yes, sir. All right. Pay attention, everybody, now. Stop everything and get downstairs as quickly as you can. Hurry up. Get down there. You men, take those coats off and leave 'em here. Boys, get into those coats. Hurry up! Get dressed. Now get down there. Stay down there at the bottom, way back. - Go on, downstairs. - MAN: Yes. On your way, on your way. Get down there. Come on now. Get that hat off there. What's the matter with you? Take all those... Get your hat off there. Oh, McGillicuddy, what are you doin'? Do you think you're trying... Get over to that window. Come on, you fellas. Get down here. Keep those cannons trained on the door. Don't let anybody by. Nobody. Take that hat off, you fat head. First National Bank. Quick! Everything's all set, Mack. Don't you think you better have a couple of men planted outside that door? No. If Mannion spotted any of us outside, he's liable to start shooting. Now, get back to your places. - Doorman. - Yes, sir. - You say you have a night bell outside? - Yes, sir. Fine. - The minute you spot Mannion, ring it. - Yes, sir. And don't be afraid. We're right behind you. (SIREN WAILING) What's the hurry? Where's the fire? What's your name? - My... My name is... - O'Connor. Mike O'Connor. License 2698. Here, never mind. I'll walk. - (TIRES SQUEALING) - (HORNS HONKING) Remember, when he comes through that door, shoot, and shoot to kill. - Have you got your men placed? - All right, Mack. - Down there, out of sight, both of you. - Get your hat down there. The minute he comes through that door, let him have it, boys. He ain't showed up yet. MACK: Fine, get back there. Stay at that door. You want to get killed? No, sir. Hey, you! Where do you think you're going? Get back here! I'm sorry, Officer. I've gotta get across the street. I've gotta get to the First National Bank. Well, you wait for the signal. Hey! Mister, please. You can't go in there. The bank's done closed for the day. - I didn't mean to... - (BLOWS WHISTLE) All right, go on. - (ALARM RINGING) - Watch it! MACK: Shoot to kill! - Say, is the bank still open? - Yes, sir. Oh, thank you. (MUTTERING) That's funny. - That's funny. - (GULPING) I must have forgotten it. I guess I left it on the table. Well, I'll have to go back for it. He done gone! He's gettin' away! Come on, men! - (ALL CLAMORING) - (WHISTLES BLOWING) That's the way we're gonna do it. We're gonna put it up to the boss straight. He don't wanna go with us, we'll take it on the lam without him. - That's right. - He can hang around here all he wants to. - Not me. - Me neither. (DOORBELL BUZZING) There he is now. - Now, remember, fellas. We stand pat. - Okay. (DOORBELL BUZZING) What's the news, boss? Have the cops knocked off Jones yet? It's time you showed up, boss. We was just thinkin' of leaving. - Yeah. We ought to get going. - This is the way we figure it. It's a great idea having the cops knock off Jones. - But now that it's over... - We wanna leave. - This town is getting too hot for us. - Lock it. The boys don't like the idea of hanging around here just on account of Gert. If you gotta have a dame, we can take the Clark girl along. Yeah. That Clark dame's okay. But the other two, they're a pain in the neck. Ah, Seaver's all right. But that Aunt Agatha, she's a holy terror. She almost talked me to death. Jones is comin' back. - Somethin' must have gone wrong. - What's that boob coming here for? - What do we do now, boss? - Should we let him in? - Yeah, let him in. - Should we plug him?
