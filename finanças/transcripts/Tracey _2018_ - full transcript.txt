It's been 25 years Last night... I had the same dream in which I played with Ching and Jun in the lake... ...listening to the same music The music which Ching liked best Ching? Is that Mr. Tung Tai-hung? Speaking Do you speak Mandarin? Yes I understand Thank you Hon? Anything wrong? Ching has passed away How sudden! An accident? Do you want me to stay? I'm okay. You go back to bed Bowie, run, Bowie Go... Are you ill? Hurry up... Morning, mom Howdy? Hello, did you have fun? - Let me - Thanks Do you want omelette or congee, like your dad? Omelette! I'll shower first Towel, Parti ! Mom, Bowie seems not well Thank you, Parti Tell her later her weekly day-off will be changed... ...from Sundays to Tuesdays Why? Aunt May saw her checking into Chungking Mansion with a man last Sunday Well? It's an Indian from her hometown, with a beard Look! Parti is from Indonesia, not India... They're all the same. I'm talking about men I deliberately told her to go to the market yesterday... ...and rummaged her things in her room You know what? I found a full pack of condoms! You rummaged Parti's stuff? You were saying Parti made out with a guy on Sunday, right? Exactly! That's intolerable! What if she's infected with those diseases? Please, mom! Listen! No! All human beings have sexual desires... No! This is not permitted in this house! I didn't expect her to have any sexual desire when I hired her - Eat! You'll be late! - Yup! - Let me call your dad - He's giving me a ride Hon? Vincent... Regarding our plan to go to London in Christmas... I have to double-check my schedule Let's call it off Why? I was thinking of visiting a friend, but he's just passed away I was thinking of visiting some university campuses You must know your mom doesn't want you to study abroad My dorm application has been approved I'll move out later this month This'll save mom from rummaging my room She's just cleaning up for you Do you know she went into Parti's room and search her stuff? You know very well that she has mysophobia She's simply sick in the mind I have yet to mention that she's a racist Good morning, Uncle Dong! - Good morning - Good morning, Chiu Good morning. boss Sorry for being late Uncle Dong, Ann's nephew will come later for a pair of glasses Give him a good discount - Sure - Thank you Uncle, did I hear wrong? The boss was only a few minutes' late, yet he apologised to us! He's very gentle ever since he's a kid You can find no boss like him nowadays Brenda? She's resigned Is Dr. Chi in? Shit! Why did he go to such dangerous places like Syria? What's there to shoot but to be shot? He's a war photographer! D'you expect him to go to some peaceful country? Still... He's a typical Hong Kongese after all Wherever one dies, one always wishes to be buried back home Dr. Chi , I'm off-duty now - Sure. See you tomorrow - Bye! - Bye, Mr. Tung - Bye Isn't she hot? I'll bet she'd be able to attract many patients Make sure you won't be #Me Too-ed Don't worry! I maybe a womanizer, but I'm never a victimizer I always parted with my girlfriends in good friendship - Trust me - You're shameless Go... - Hi , there - Hello - Where did you eat with Jun? - We went to Yuen Long That's far away! Keep on practicing Hon, I'd like to discuss something with you I don't like our maid very much Can we hire another? It's up to you In that case, I'll ask my friends in the troupe for some recommendations The previous agency was no good Okay Are these Ching's photos? Yes Okay, I'll take a stroll with Bowie How's Bowie? Where is he? The doctors are operating on him now How come he passed out? You should have taken him home if he's tired Stop that I tied him up on the sidewalk... When I returned, he was already unconscious You left him on the sidewalk? Jesus! Why on earth did you do that? I met a friend I'll call sis You'll wake her up. She's pregnant I'll WhatsApp her You never listened! Ching, Jun! What? Come over here! What happened with that dog? He's badly injured Gross! Don't touch him! He must have been bitten by other dogs or animals Will he live? Let's bury him - Let's gather some leaves - Why? I once read that some animals, like the elephants... ...will cover up their dying fellow animals with leaves... ...as a gesture of condolence Bowie, Hope you'll find yourself a good master in your next life, Bowie How do you know his name? I don't. The name of David Bowie just popped up Isn't he your favourite? I won't be going to school with you guys for my open exam results Why? Didn't we agree to go together? My aunt recommended a job at the restaurant for me I've been working for 3 days You're already helping your uncle with his street stall... ...until 2 a.m . every night. Do you have enough sleep? You sure you'll give up university? My sis is still in high school. The priority for study should go to her Any news from the police? Have they arrested your dad's murderer? They said the guy might have escaped to the mainland How about Graduation Ball? Are you going? They're inviting the girls from Sacred Heart and St. Paul's Convent I'm still in mourning You're betraying Ching and me! We've always been The Three Musketeers! Tai-hung will never do that. We'll be best friends forever! Right! Till death do us part! How cheesy! Let me drive you home first, Brigitte May I stay with you and mom tonight? Why? Jeffrey has to be in court tomorrow. I don't want to wake him - How about your folate? - I have that with me Sorry for my poor Cantonese, but I understand it well What actually happened at the Customs? I didn't realise Hong Kong is so backward I was going through the Customs... ...and was holding Ching's ashes A couple of Airport Security came up and asked me what it was I told them it's my husband's ashes They immediately said that I wasn't allowed to bring them into Hong Kong Who did you say Ching was? My hubby! We got married in the UK. Didn't you know that? Then someone from the Customs insisted they had to detain the ashes I ended up in a fierce argument with them I have lost Ching once. I cannot afford to lose him twice The guy from the Customs took me into a small room ... ...and searched my luggage thoroughly I showed them our marriage certificate They said same sex marriage is illegal in Hong Kong I told them Ching was a Hong Kongese But they insisted on proof for that All Ching's belongings are in the UK Why would his ashes be denied entrance into his hometown? Ching hasn't got any relative in Hong Kong What kind of proof do they want? Don't worry. We'll find some lawyer to deal with that Isn't your son-in-law a lawyer? Gee, I was so shocked that Ching was gay He was getting all the pretty girls in the world... - ... leaving only the ugly ones for me - Everyone has his own secret Everyone has his own secret - Did he make out with you? - I diot! It's all settled - Shall we have dinner? - I'm too tired for that - I'll see you in the morning, then - Deal. - 9am tomorrow? - OK See you Good Night. - Bye Bye - See you See you Let me call my son-in-law Ok, Let's go. No need to worry, dad I've just contacted a Member of the Legislative Council He said it's just a matter of time. We'll get the ashes back Why the LegCo Member? Because this has been a very hot issue... ...your friend's case can shed some light on it But will this be appropriate? Let's have a meeting with your friend first Did you have a row with Brigitte? She's been a little emotionally unstable since pregnancy Fair enough... Considering this, and Bowie's situation - She loves Bowie very much - What's with Bowie? Hello, Jeffrey... Sit Why are you free? I picked up a friend at the airport He's not free for dinner ...half a century ago, he's known in Guangzhou... ...as "Diva of East China"... - Where's Brigitte? - Let me find out ...Let's welcome Mr. Fa Yim-hung! Brother Darling! Here I cometh... Mr. Cheng, which horse are you betting on tonight? My Fair Lady is a sure win! Good luck to you Take a seat first. I'll change into my uniform Tai-hung, Brother Darling! where have you been? The headwaiter was looking for you . I told him you were in the loo I've brought two classmates with me - Serve them an extra dish - No problem Hello, are you Tai-hung's classmates? Thank you What's your favourite dish? I'll get it for you Cool! I'd like a shrimp rice noodle roll, and chicken bun! How about you? What's your name? - I'm Ching - And I'm Jun Naughty Jun! Want a Coke? I'll get you two bottles Bro Darling, hot water please! Coming! What's the rush? Who's that guy? He's weird He was a famous opera actor in Guangzhou . He played female's role Is he queer? His stage-name is Fa Yim-hung. But the nickname is... - Brother Darling! - Brother Darling? He seems to like that Peeper! Help! I'll take a look Sorry! Please forgive me Softer! Thank you, Tai-hung Are you alright, Tai-hung? Bro Darling, this is Ching, my classmate We've just introduced. What a good-looking boy What happened? Bro Darling went into the ladies' room and got beaten up That's not the case at all The cubicles in the men's room was under repair for two days I've been drinking almost no water, but still... There's no one in the ladies' room. So I thought I'd take a quick leak And this woman just dashed in before I finished... Why didn't you use the urinal? I can't do that while standing! I know what you're thinking You are too young to understand I'm actually a woman Born with a male body... I am actually a female... Bro Darling! Who was that old "qiandan" (drag singer)? Old "qiandan" ? You mean Bro Darling? He's an old friend. I knew him from the restaurant where I was a waiter He's almost like a teacher for me Bro Darling? What kind of name is that? It's a nickname. He's a great guy Ching and Jun knew him, too Is that so? Brigitte has come to our house again It's Gonorrhea! A venereal disease How come? Ask your fucking son-in-law! Vincent! ...Sit down When did that happen? He said he was playing golf with his friends in the Philippines But why? You've been married for less than three years It wasn't the first time for that son-of-a-bitch. Sis just didn't tell you Shut up! Are you sure? You're the only one who's not sure You aren't even sure what kind of person that asshole is - Vincent! - Am I wrong? In the beginning, it was mom who liked him She liked him for his lawyer degree, for the money he made - What are you talking about? - How could my sister marry him? I married Jeffrey out of my own choice What did Dr. Leung say about the baby? Luckily, it's in the early stage. The baby isn't infected But I'm thinking of getting rid of it But you just said the baby's fine I learned about his messing around with women soon after marriage, I exposed his lies. He promised me in tears he'd change Things did get better for a while But lately I've detected some traces again I thought maybe a baby would help. But I was wrong Forget about abortion. It'll ruin your health But I'm not sure if I can raise a child on my own You want to divorce? - Is there any alternative? - Shut up! You must not divorce. I won't allow that - Come on, mom! - I'm not talking to you You're pathetically pedantic! There are only two choices for sis Either divorce after abortion, or give birth to the baby and divorce Are you mad? Why insist on a divorce? You don't just get rid of something when it gets damaged It's your generation that causes all the chaos in nowadays' society - My generation? - Yes - Do you know you're sick? - Am I? You wanna fire the maid - because she made love to men - What has this got to do with the maid? - What has this got to do with the maid? - I want to say... - You're scared of VD, right? - Of course But that one who passed on his VD to sis is your son-in-law not the maid I'm talking about my daughter, not the maid The maid has her human rights, too! The maid has her human rights, too! The truth is: it's the privileged class like you who creates... ...all the injustice of this society. Not my generation - Are you accusing me? - Vincent! That's enough! Enough? I've had enough, too! This is ridiculous! You must never divorce You'll be left with nothing after divorce How would you survive? Aren't you tired after sex? Males and females were created differently Wow, what is this? The theme of tattoo for a customer She's very young and has a son in the primary school Her first husband had abused her for 4 years Her second husband loved her very much but died from melancholia She's heartbroken and decided to tattoo this in memory of the latter What are you doing? Take a shower and go home You're disturbing my work I'm homeless now. Can you give me a shelter? You're my girlfriend after all I must finish this tonight. Stop nagging Why do you like tattoo? There's no reason... My body belongs to me I'd like it to be a canvas, on which I can draw pictures... ...to denote the different periods in my life What will you draw to denote our relationship? Where will you draw? I think we've barely known each other for a year But we've made love for god-knows how many times? - Come on. - What are you doing? Answer me, have you ever made love on a tattoo couch? - Many many times! - Don't tell me! - Many many times! - Let's do it now! I haven't been sleeping well since Ching died Insomnia. I'd always wake up in two or three hours You were rarely in touch with each other, right? Yes We were at different ends of the world all these years How did you know each other? Five years ago. In Myanmar Myanmar? Yes. That was the year in which... ...Aung San Suu Kyi was released and elected as a MP I was thinking of a novel with Myanmar as background So I went to Rangoon for research Ching was there for a magazine. We stayed in the same hotel You're a writer? I published my first collection of prose at 1 5 in Singapore Then studied in Taiwan I met Ching after my graduation and went to the UK with him Two years later, they passed the bill for same-sex marriage and we got married - Ching was very lucky - I was the lucky one You know... Ching loved telling me stories of his younger days Is that true? Did he say anything about me? He said he had a crush on you He said it was reciprocal Nothing happened between us He said you were avoiding him Is fear the reason why you didn't come out? I understand it was different 30 years ago Is that why you used marriage as a cover-up? It's nothing like that... did you finish your book? I had sent it to the publisher before I left London If things are smooth, it'll be published at the year-end It's a pity Ching won't be able to read it Excuse me It's my son-in-law Jeffrey Hi , dad Please sit. Sorry. Didn't see you - This is Bond... Jeffrey - Nice to meet you Nice to meet you I talked to a Legislative Council Member about your story last night He's the first LegCo Member to come out in Asia He's preparing a bill for "Cremation Arrangements for Same-sex Partners" He's very interested in your story This sounds great Indeed we should raise more public awareness in this issue Perfect. How about this? Can you recount what happened in detail? - Excuse me. Bathroom first - Sure dad Did Brigitte say anything? She wanted a divorce I still love her very much... - Don't tell me this - Can you help me You must restore her trust in you Can you still walk? Exhausted? How many floors to go, Bro Darling? Easy! I have to climb these stairs a few times each day Certain things require perseverance Help yourself I don't understand. That year after I returned from Sichuan... ...why on earth did you disappear? My uncle won a lottery and opened an optical shop I became his assistant... ...and quit the restaurant Please forgive me for not saying goodbye properly Don't be silly. After all, this reunion is proof... ...that we're destined to cross paths again And you? When did you stop working at the restaurant? More than 1 0 years ago. I'm too old and slow But no worries. I'll survive Luckily there're people who still remember me as an actor It gives me so much pleasure to perform What a surprise that your wife's also an actress! She sings very well She's called Anne. She's an amateur Any kids? A son and a daughter With a family and a career, you must be a happy man now I'm not sure One's destiny is not for one to decide How time flies! We're now almost at the end of our lives Tai-hung! I got this Guanyin pendant from a high monk in Sichuan I had intended to give to you as a gift But you left Guanyin is formless and asexual, sometimes male and sometimes, female This is a female. Suits you Thank you very much How have you been, mother? How's your appetite? I'm fine. It's nice of you to come I missed you. Just wanna see you Too bad I can't see... Is Vincent going to the UK soon? He can never make up his mind Is it expensive? It's affordable Excuse me. It's a little messy... Don't feel too bad You know? We were talking about adopting a kid... ...after he returned from Syria We'd take him to places... We had even thought of his name Who'd have known... ...he'd come back in such a way...? These people said ... One of them said , "I've never seen the ashes of a homo," ...and ordered me to open the urn for him to take a look Why must we have to call for lawyers and senators and journalists... ...to reclaim the dignity that's been denied from us? You're very brave No, I'm not... I'm very tired! Ching hasn't left us He's still here. I can feel it What's that? - What can I do for you, sir? - I'd like an examination Look at the brightest spot. What do you see? A road A deserted road , long and endless How about you? What do you see in my eyes? What exactly are you running from? Well, Mr. Tung, thank you Wait! This is where Jun, Ching and me... ...often played when we were young You swam in nude? They did . I didn't Very youthful Ching is the first man I fell in love with And most probably the man I loved most in my life He loved you, too. I know But I cannot see... ...where the problems lied when both of you loved each other See? You're like that everyday? Almost You intend to spend the rest of your life like that? My life is coming to an end How old are you? I've seen queers coming out at 50... ...and gang-bang everyday till they're 70 or 80 I'm not gay Fine. So you're not gay Tell me. Do you love your wife? Have you ever realised you're hurting your wife and kids everyday? Have you ever realised you're just being selfish Stop thinking yourself a tragic hero! You're just a masochist... ...who sees himself as a victim I am a woman What's this shit? Not on the outside... ...but deep inside Are you a transsexual? I sensed that I was different from other boys at an early age At first I also thought I was gay Until there was this time... I realised at that moment... ...the least thing I ever wanted Ching to be... ...was him being gay I loved him . But in my fantasy... ...if we're together, I was always the girl, and he, the boy I detested my body But there's no way to get rid of it I had to look at it and touch it everyday It's so repulsive I didn't know how to tell others Even if I did, no one would understand Ching would He's passionate about life He would have accepted you. He loved you It's too late now Nothing is too late There are many things you can still change I'm destined to be a man The day before my matriculation results were announced... ...my father was killed by a thief on the street It was a big blow for my mother My sister was very small I became the only man in the family I had to quit school and work. I was left with no other choices Even my wife was picked by my mother When my kids were born, I actually felt grateful I was convinced that this is my destiny That's not true. You're just deceiving yourself If there's nothing you can do about it... ...why wear female underwears? When there are things you cannot obtain... ...you'll start looking for a substitute Like whenever I take a leak... I'll use the cubicle, sitting down Ever since I had my own shop and private office... ... I started to secretly change into women's panties, and at times, corsets... ...during the day, and change back before home That's that! You can opt for an operation Your kids are grown-ups now I'm already 51 . Why should I do that? Why not? If you can live to 80, there're 30 more years to go I'm serious Each of us is responsible for his own life What? Parti took your suit to the laundry. They found this in your pocket They're presents for mother Those are women's panties I paid a visit to Bro Darling, the old actor Seeing that he's kind of deprived, I bought some cloths for him Turns out he's a transvestite So I ended up buying these for him, to cheer him up I was so embarrassed upon payment Really? I know what you have in mind . I never did Did what? You should know better. I never had another woman since we married I wish you had Don't be silly - Did you read the news? - What? Ching, your buddy, liked men I've just learned that How about you? You don't like women, do you? Elaine's husband told her a couple of days ago... ...that he had been living with a man for years - Elaine who? - The one who plays old men's roles in our troupe I'd look for a guy if I were her husband Relax. I'm not gay. I'm alright If you are alright... ...does it mean it's me who isn't alright all these years? No. We are both alright I promise. I'll take good care of you and the kids Hubby, you're finally home We have to part now. Thank you Thank you for everything Do you have anything to say to Ching? Ching, you're the pride of The Three Musketeers Please forgive me Come on, cheer up Let's have a toast For Ching! - Thank you - Don't mention it Now that I can finally speak my mind... Honestly, the first time you said Ching was your husband ... ... I was really shocked Being gay is no big deal! There's really no need for Ching to be so secretive Indeed! Although you were buddies... ...you don't seem to be very honest to each other What do you mean? I always recounted my amorous adventures to my two buddies... ...in every single detail Tai-hung is the most candid of us three I know everything about him Babbler! Oh, shit! Did you really make it with Ching? Moron! Tai-hung! Go ahead Go ahead what? I simply couldn't find the words to tell you Sorry, Jun I'm fine Comparing to you guys, I just feel... ...fucking shallow I was supposed to be the most open-minded... ...but I turned out to be the dumbest! What a fucking dumb ass! Let me take you to see someone, Jun - Who is it? - Bro Darling? Bro Darling? - Tai-hung? The door is unlocked - I see Bro Darling! Recognise him? Jun! Naughty Jun! This naughty boy has grown into a hamshop man now Bro Darling! Long time no see Easy... Sit down first... Sit down... Don't rock him so hard - I'm so thrilled - Sit down ... Let me introduce. This is Bond Hi , Bro Darling.

You mustn't laugh at me Wow, very precious photos! Autographed, too Do you know who she is? Dunno This is Hung Sin-nui . She's like the Hong Kong Barbara Streisand He's too young to know that She came to watch our performance and took this photo with me I was in heaven! There's more... Bro Darling, you're such a beauty! You're simply stunning What a sweet talker at your age! Where is the suitcase with all those beautiful costumes? You mean my dress container? I've sold most of my costumes This is my favourite role, Huo Xiaoyu in The Purple Hairpin Bro Darling is a real character! Agreed. Such a nice person, too Life is being unfair to him Is he the same as you? A trans I bet he'd never heard of the word I've got an idea What? What's that? What is it? What is this? I hope you're not making fun of me Bro Darling, we're going to make you into a real darling Presenting the modern version of Huo Xiaoyu! Isn't this fucking great? - Watch your tongue! - My tongue is fine Bro Darling! Close your eyes I guarantee you'll be a true beauty in 30 minutes' time How about you? Wanna try? Come on!

I shouldn't propose to do this I'm too capricious It's not your fault There's no denial that Bro Darling really enjoyed himself tonight I hope I can be like him , die with a big grin Reply his messages. You're making him suffer He's the one who's making me suffer I don't even know how to face him What's the fuss? He's just in drag What if he's gay? What should I do? Being gay and in drag are two entirely different matters And besides being gay, there are other possibilities Please don't further complicate things Straight people can be transvestites Some may be transgender. There's nothing wrong about it If my mom finds out any of those things you've mentioned... ...is true of my dad, she'll go nuts My family will fall into pieces So you don't even let him tell his story? I don't want to know anything about it Didn't you use the rainbow icon as your Facebook profile? So it's alright for others to be gay, transvestites or transgender Yet if any of these is true of your family members, it's prohibitive Please stop pressuring me! - I'm very disappointed in you - Come on! Go away! Come on, go home and take a rest I'll deal with the hospital formalities tomorrow Let's go, Tai-hung Be sensible. Move I can't go home Why? Of course, the way you look...

Thank you Miss Tung, we have to close this place now Thank you - Hungry? - Yes I'll take you to a nice restaurant Help yourself High-heel shoes are awful! Sorry, no comment Do you know, I always twisted my "chai" (ankles) when I first learned to wear high-heels - You don't know the meaning of "twisted chai"? - No idea Cantonese are very naughty "Chai" refers to the dick So "dark chai" means the dick of a black man ... ...and "wasted chai" means an impotent person It really hurts Why do you keep two pieces of "chai" here? - Give them back to me - Okay Bad boy! Alright, I'll tell you The doc told me I have to keep exercising the vagina Otherwise it'll grow back together - Does it hurt? - A little It's a lot better than after the operations Why two pieces? The doc asked me what size do I prefer I told him, "All sizes!" - What are you laughing at? - Why hit me with that? To tell the truth, I do have the feeling of a hard-on at times But when I feel it down there... ... I know very well I'm a woman Do you find it disturbing to have that hard-on feeling? Nope It was very embarrassing in the past But it feels pretty amazing now The doc said I should learn how to communicate and love my body It's feels nice Is was a wonderful. What are you doing? Do you feel like a man or a woman? A woman Are you sure? I'm sure. I'm also sure Ching will do the same And you? Mother, watch my make-up Let me touch you once more Male or female, you're always my child Don't cry Mother knows you have had a difficult life No one can blame you It's just like what your father said... One must learn how to find one's peace of mind I understand, mother mother I'm no longer called Tai-hung What your new name? I've adopted yours, Chui-see (Tracey) Mother, let's take a stroll Tell me, where did you pick up the name of Chui-see? Your grandpa had two wives My mother was called Chui-ting. My step-mother, Pui-see I'm the eldest daughter. Grandpa didn't like daughters So he just picked a word from each wife's name... ...to be my name. Hence, Chui-see, What a misunderstanding! I thought you're a progressive gal!
