(SRC) In this development center The universal transport mission Cosmos Noan is to be launched soon The monsters protected in Kapuya Island are ready to move out Under the SRC plan they are going to create a new world in the broad universe Human beings will try to avoid interfering with its ecological system in a hope of finding a way of co-existing with them This is a great plan come up with by a young man who doesn't give up his dream of making the miracle possible Cosmos Because of you This is possible What the hell are you doing? Hi Fubuki I am the captain of the newborn Team EYES You are awesome Fubuki A new utopia plan.. Your dream will be realized The planet has been made into a place suitable for monsters They can move out next week As long as we believe we can make dreams come true I can say it out loud nowadays Fubuki What are you planning to do? It's a holiday today I'd like to go to Kapuya Island Lidorias will be the first to be delivered If I don't see it we can't meet for a long time Just Lidorias? Ah? Don't be stupid You wanna see someone else Fubuki..you are mistaken Don't be shy There aren't many opportunities for you to meet it You have to be kind to it Yes Haruno Musashi Why Cosmos has been isolated with you? Kashima.. what's up? Captain. we've intercepted a strange signal Signal? Yes (Newborn Team EYES Control Room) Vice Captain We're trying to translate it We see words like "re-start" and "destroy" Destroy? An unidentified object is approaching in the air Enter the status of emergency alert Enter the status of emergency alert An unidentified object That is.. A robot? Its target is.. Is it our rocket? Musashi..don't go Ultraman Cosmos.. Ultraman Cosmos vs Ultraman Justice The Final Battle Alright Why does Ultraman Cosmos have to protect human beings? You.. Who are you? Justice Ah? Cosmos Cosmos..I have to fight with you In order to protect.. You told me The great dream Cosmos Dream? Musashi Cosmos You pay more attention to the ambiguous dream.. than Ultraman Justice? That is.. The other one Ultraman How come? Justice..why? Wait a moment! Why do we attack each other? Musashi Musashi..Cosmos.. Stand up now Stand up..Cosmos.. Musashi Don't! Why? Why? Impossible! Musashi Cosmos And Musashi won't.. SRC was attacked by an unidentified huge robot this morning The transport rocket, ''Noan Cosmos'' was completely destroyed The huge robot appeared above the SRC suddenly They say Ultraman Cosmos has died Come on..how is that possible? So we will be dead too? The government will figure it out since they've levied so much tax But even Ultraman is dead? If so..we can't win Vice Captain We've lost the contact with Germina Station We can't establish any connection with any of the stations The underground base on the moon is not responding We've lost all the channels of information The earth is isolated? What is that spaceships intention? Captain You'd better take a rest I will be fine I have to attend the high-peak meeting later But.. I'll report on the current situation Captain The signal is decoded But.. But? The content is.. They want to "restart" all the lives on earth That means.. They want to destroy everything This is to say.. Their intention is.. How do you get here? I want to attend the meeting I can express Delasion's order more correctly Delasion's order? What does that mean? It's time.. I have never heard of him? She is Justice The one who defeated Ultraman Cosmos I am the representative of SRC Oowada What is your intention? I am here to tell the earthlings It's a waste of time and effort to resist Waste of time and effort? What do you mean? 35 hours from now All the creative on the earth will be restarted Restarted? What does that mean? Literally speaking. All the lives will be destroyed This is the final decision of Ultraman Justice Ultraman Justice? Delasion, like the Ultramans is responsible for universal order This is.. Giga Endora.. It's used to destroy human beings and all the other creatures No Why does Delasion want to destroy the earth? Because we can foresee the future Future? 2000 years later The earth will become a dangerous planet So we have to destroy everything and renew all the lives You are too dictatorial Why are you so certain it will be dangerous? It's just like people kill white ants before they eat up the building? You are too dictatorial You think this will happen? From the perspective of the universe That is not important What about communications? Is any negotiation possible? (We want to fight back) (I don't care about Ultraman Justice) (We have to fight back) (This is justice of the earth) Good job All the military satellites are moving towards the appointed position and calculating the distance from the US and USSR missiles to the target US nuclear submarine SSU-78 is moving directly towards the target How about the destructive weapon of invading the solar system? It will be within the satellite laser range in 16 hours What about the spaceship afterwards? It stays put above the Pacific Ocean According to the analysis There's no living sign on the spaceship That means..there's no one on it Whatever I'll crush it with space jets No rush Team EYES is not responsible for attacks What should we do? Delasion We have to respond to Delasion's message If we return that unique signal maybe we can make it But we don't have enough time And they don't show any interest in communicating with us Be confident Even if our odds are low If he were here He would say the same thing Musashi We will meet again Ayano Ayano Captain Hiura, Shinobu, and Doigaki are here too Don't worry We share the same idea Musashi won't be defeated so easily He must be alive That's right Ayano Let's work together and find Musashi out Yes.. Listen Cosmos is dead The earth will be destroyed Cosmos is destroyed We will see the end of the world Cosmos can't handle it All of us will be dead The world will doom Everything will be gone The toughest Ultraman Justice.. Justice Laugh Everything will be gone I won't repeat the same mistake Cosmos Great. Cosmos just slipped away This is Cosmos? I don't think so It is cowardly It barks all the time It didn't bark Because you are a good guy This is for you from Cosmos and I Goodbye Cosmos.. where did you go? You can't do it again Cosmos. let's go It is because you're a good guy I am a girl A girl The end of the world is coming Let's play together Chick..don't go Plague is always plague What..you What are you doing there? Let's go.. Alright Go now Don't come closer This is called human nature Help There's no value of protection (24 hours from human destruction) All the guided missiles and satellite lasers are in position Fine Our target is Giga Endora And the enemy spaceships above the Pacific Ocean Concentrate our force What's up now? Is there any response? Yes.. It's dim Cosmos' life sign is detected in this area But the range of search is still too big We can't minimize it A new city? That is the place Musashi and Cosmos met Are you sure? I heard Musashi talk about it He met Cosmos for the first time at this outdoor forest park For the first time.. he met Cosmos He's still alive Musashi is alive Musashi Musashi Cosmos Justice You used to be with Cosmos Protecting the earth from the threat of Sandloss I didn't fight for human Sandloss destroyed many planets So I killed it For the justice in the universe? Right When I met Ultraman Justice for the first time I felt it.. You were not just strong You were kind.. just like Cosmos Sandloss was like human beings What? Having dreams.. and affections It was an incomplete organism Musashi It's my fault Never mind I made the decision myself A strong power incurs another stronger one It's an endless war In fact.. we should take other measures But.. no matter what fray it is There must be a way Launch all the laser cannons US guided missiles..launched USSR missiles are passing the China's sky British guided missiles are passing the Canada's sky Human beings will be like Sandloss sooner or later They will become a dangerous people Even if that is true We still 2000 years of time for making changes Making changes? I gave Sandloss a chance like that 200 years ago But I was wrong After meeting Musashi I finally found.. Human beings possess possibilities And hopes.. This is a perfect sentence Cosmos I hope Justice can understand I won't repeat the same mistake You just choose an easier path An easier path? Whether it be Musashi or Cosmos They still cling to their hopes of miracles Miracles? But in fact Miracles don't happen (Right below the target) (Stop the cruise) (8000 feet away from the enemy ship) (All the guided missiles are in position) (5 minutes from the launch) (Missile 1..ready) (Missile 2..ready) Captain. what's up now? It's one minute away from the missile's arrival What about our communication with Delasion? It doesn't work out They just don't respond (10 seconds from the launch) 9876543210) (Fire) The missile will hit the target in 10 seconds Go How is the effect? They are not wounded We've fired so many missiles I can't believe it How about the attack in the universe? We made it? The enemy's moving speed is not changed Even a small planet of S00km diameter can be crushed.. The force is still not enough Captain..the huge spaceship has dropped many objects Are they the huge robots? Even the military satellites are totally destroyed Because of the attack Gloker has made a decision Our will of resistance will be cleared I fear..human beings will be put out Natsuki..don't give up If you give up your dreams and hope Everything will be gone Our partners are still looking for Musashi and Cosmos This way They don't give up even to the last minute Musashi Hang on to the last minute Captain Team EYES Move out Yes sir Captain I..what should I do? Keep trying to make contacts Yes sir Delasion's judgment is right And.. So is mine Mini Mini Are you Mini? How are you? Why is it here? Ikeyma It wants me to look for Musashi We are not good helpers but let us give you a hand Shinobu Shinobu Mari Even Musashi's mom is here Why are you here? This is the only place Because this place is full of his memory Musashi.. Where are you? Where on earth are you? Ayano Target is 3000 away There's no life sign It doesn't work The miracle doesn't exist Even so We don't give up That is.. Lidorias What is.. Golmede Captain..look It's Don Lon And Bolgils is here too The monsters that have been helped by Cosmos have showed up for the crisis It's time now Yes sir Fire Why do the monsters work with human beings? Cosmos Help.. Cosmos Help.. Help Cosmos What's wrong? Cosmos is buried under here Cosmos.. Cosmos Please save it Get out of here now Your life is more valuable than that dog No Cosmos Cosmos is my friend Please help it Cosmos My friend Gloker Type 2 Now the monsters do not have any odds Are you alright? Release me If you don't save Cosmos it will die Value that dog more than your life Destroy all the rebels Why? Why are they like this? Cosmos It's great..Cosmos Thank you Cosmos This is the reason why you safeguard this planet? Stop now Is this the reason why you believe in humans? Damn.. the engine is damaged Captain.. get out now No..I can't Vice captain..look Ultraman Justice Destroy all the rebels Musashi Do we have to give up our hopes? Ayano Musashi?
