GOD: Gene Kelly. I could tell you stories about Gene Kelly. [CHUCKLES] [PEOPLE CHEERING IN BACKGROUND] Well, I'm out of time. Don't wanna miss the show. Christ, what... What is this?

[SWORD SCRAPES] Knoxville, Tennessee. Waitressing, substitute teaching. Whatever. My real job was rum and Cokes and making bad choices. [SNIFFS AND CHUCKLES] Sleeping with cops, dealing weed to eighth graders. I was lost. Until I met Klaus. Saw his strength, his humorless cruelty, and I... I was lost all over again. TULIP: Oh, yeah. Nothing like humorless cruelty to get you going. Shut up! I am so sick and tired of you nonbelievers. Smoking and smirking. And just thinking of themselves and what they're gonna get. Well, you don't have to think anymore 'cause when the righteous lays down with the wicked, this is what they get. [CLICKING] [SCREAMS IN FRUSTRATION] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Damn it, Sarah. You can't do anything right. Uh... May I? [SNIFFLES] [CRYING] Sometimes, with the SIG Sauer, when the firing pin gets hot... [BLOWS] It jams, I know. True what you say about selfishness in the world. Sometimes, doing what's right for you, and just you, no cause, no religion, no man, it ain't selfish at all. Sometimes, it's just righteous. Now, this is fixed. But I'm gonna keep it. I got tons of them. Aah! [CHIRPING] STARR: Still not working. [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PHONE] No, there's no time for an in-house service call. The world is ending today.

It's just such a pleasure. The pleasure is mine. Hey, while I have you, let me bend your ear a minute 'cause I got a lot of questions. ANNOUNCER: Now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment we've been waiting for, for 2,000 years. [LOUD CHEERING] The Messiah! [CHEERING CONTINUES] Showtime. Uh... Look, I don't like it either, but this is the deal. So come on. Uh... Don't give me that. They were gonna kill you. Uh, no. Come on. Don't hide in the clothes. No. Get out! [WHIMPERING] Now. They're all gonna die anyway. Come on. [GRUNTING] What are you doing, Cass? [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] Die! [GRUNTS] [YELLS] Come on! Hippie wimp! Fascist pig. [YELLS] [COCKS GUN] [STEADY BEEPING] WOMAN: [ON PA] Dr. Rodell to the burn unit. Dr. Rodell to the burn unit. MAN: Okay, he's waking up. Let's remove the bandages. Hello there, mate. You've had an accident. The bad news is, you've suffered some facial trauma. But the good news is, you're gonna be fine. Nurse, could you, uh, could you get the mirror? Plastic surgeons here have been working day and night. Called you their passion project. So we're all just a little bit curious to see what... Oh, my God. [NURSE GASPS AND SCREAMS] Have some respect, people. It's still a human being! [WOMAN SCREAMS] [SIGHS HEAVILY] [THUDS] Aah! [CHRISTINA YELLS] [GROANS] Oh, he got me. Right in the pancreas. But you'll come back to life, right? [GROANS] I shat myself. [GROANS] I haven't done that since... He can't kill you. I think that boy... He can kill anything. Our baby. Our baby. You do the right thing. Yeah. And what is that? [CHRISTINA SCREAMS] Sweetheart! Genesis... [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GUNSHOTS] [GRUNTING] Oh. All right. [GRUNTS] You win. Goodbye, Preacher. [COCKS GUN] You hear that? Peace and quiet. Family picnics, planting a garden. That's what he's offering. And that's what you want. So go on. One last kill, if that's really what you want. [BOTH GRUNTING] If he lives, everyone dies. You get that, right? It's not my problem. [HUMPERDOO WHIMPERS] Hump, go and wait in the clothes. TULIP: What the hell is wrong with you? Hmm? Jesse? I love him. Ever since I was a little kid. I never stopped. He came back and... [SIGHS] I get that that sucks a little bit for you. I get it. But you wanna blow up the whole world 'cause of it? Wise up, quit acting like a baby, and move! Move! What do you want me to say, huh? You're my best friend. No one, and I mean no one, makes me laugh like you do. And you know I love you, but... Only when I'm sad. And I need a little shag. You've hit me a lot. And, honestly, I let it go because I love you. So I just let you hurt me. But I am so done. And if you hit me like that again, honestly, I'm gonna fucking kill you. I'm sorry. MAN: First I'm hearing it, you know? You're my best friend. You think it's okay to try and grab-ass my wife? Henry, he didn't grab-ass. He just sent me a text. That's not even the worst of it. Next, he tries to tell me... You're disappointed in me. You're just another unbeliever. Stand up and get on the tarp. And you believe what, exactly? Duty. Service. Righteousness. Toiling in a harsh and hateful life to be rewarded in Paradise. Life is not a thing to pass through. Life is the thing itself. Look there. The particulates of dust dancing in the window light. Nothing very hateful about that, is there? I just got off the phone with a submarine commander in the Egyptian Navy. While the world turns to ash, we'll make our escape. No. You're getting on the tarp. "We"? We're going to live under the sea, you and I. Eating, yoga, talking about books we like, pleasuring you repeatedly with my anus. I don't think you'll get that kind of offer from Paradise. You are of great value to me, Flufferman. And you always have been. Sorry, sir, but my name is Featherstone. [GUNSHOT] [THUDS] [TULIP GRUNTING] [WHIMPERS] [PEPPY PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] The clock says zero. He has to dance. That's the signal. ALL: Kill us all! Kill us all! Kill us all! Kill us all! MAN: At the end of the day, how many beers you've had is no excuse. I wonder where the Holy Child is? WOMAN: It's been a while. You know these performer types. Want us to beg for it. Maybe somebody should check on him. I'm in the middle of my story. Or not. It's your apocalypse. You can die some other day. I wanna die today. Let's go. ALL: Kill us all! Kill us all! I'd bring help, in case he has stage fright. ALL: Kill us all! Kill us all! [GLASS SHATTERS] [GRUNTING] MAN: Messiah? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Messiah? Messiah? [THUDS] MAN: Messiah? Messiah?

So much for second chances. To the moon. [GUNSHOT] [YELPS] CASSIDY: He was the best person I ever met. No bullshit, no agendas. He liked everyone, even assholes. It was the way I'd feel when I was with him, you know? [SNIFFLES] It just felt like... Like he changed you. [TEARFULLY] He was really special. [BOTH GRUNTING] Jew! Jew! you're goddamn right. [YELLS] Dad? It's time, son. Finally. It's time for what? To... To be the Messiah. ALL: [CHANTING] Messiah! Messiah! Messiah! Messiah! Messiah! [BOOING] I got some bad news for you people. [BOOING CONTINUES] [IN ALTERED VOICE] So listen up. [AUDIENCE FALLS SILENT] You're saying no? I used to want it. To be the Savior for everyone, like you promised. I'm just a person, you know? No better, no worse than anybody. You know I don't need you, right? The "Messiah" thing, it's just... It's... It's showbiz. I can blow the whole thing up myself at any time for any reason. Or you could be merciful. Mer... Patient, tolerant, and loving. [SHOUTS] Loving? Yeah. And these three things remain. Faith, hope, and love. The greatest of the... [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Run. [ENGINE STARTS] [IN NORMAL VOICE] The world is not coming to an end. Not today anyway. We're not getting away with it that easy. So for all of you watching this unhappy horseshit talent show, [IN ALTERED VOICE] turn your TVs off. WOMAN: That's disappointing. [DOOR OPENS] [MONITORS BEEPING STEADILY] Is everything okay, Doc? DOCTOR: I was at home lying in bed, and I couldn't stop thinking about you. Okay. Thinking about what you've endured. It's been so hard, hasn't it? Yeah. Hasn't been easy... that's for sure. I'm here to help make it easy for you. I can't do everything because of ethical concerns, but I can switch this heart monitor off. What? Take the safety off this morphine drip. What? It is time to lay your burden down, son. It's time to sleep with the angels. When I leave, you just press that button again and again and again. And then, you are free. Okay? You know, life has been hard. Eighteen years. Laughed at. Teased. Puked on. The worst part is... The worst part is assholes like you... feeling sorry for me. 'Cause I'm fine. Actually no. I'm better than fine. Okay I... I am Eugene... Edward Root! So screw you. And screw your angels... and get the hell out! [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] JESSE: [IN NORMAL VOICE] God's gone, again. He's on the run, again. And I say "Good, go run." I've been searching for Him a long time now. So long I can't remember not. What do I have to show for it? What good has it done me? Other than make me see the worst in myself. Miss the best in others that I care about. So I'm gonna stop looking. And that's where you fascist assholes come in 'cause I'm not done with God. Make no mistake. No matter where He runs, no matter how long it takes, I want Him found! So... [IN ALTERED VOICE] Go find Him. [TUNING GUITAR] [SINGING] Closing time Open all the... Closing time... Open all the doors and... [TUNING GUITAR] Closing time... Open all the doors...

It's so quiet. CASSIDY: Christ. The three of us saved the world. In, like, an actual sense. Not many people can say that, huh? Churchill. Lincoln. Who else? Frodo Baggins. [LAUGHS] He's fictional. Hmm? He's a fictional character. If you say so. The little guy with the furry feet, lives with a wizard. It's not real. All right, firstly, the wizard was a guest, man. He never actually lived with him. And B... [ECHOING] Till the end of the world! All right. Now what? Shit. Do you think they gave up? [TIRES SQUEALING] The Rodriguez Brothers? All this for that thing? [GUNS COCKING] [MEN SHOUTING] TULIP: t's a distributor from a 1936 Cord 810. They don't even make them anymore. Ammo?

[GUNSHOTS] [SPEAKING ENGLISH] I can make them blow each other. TULIP: Okay, there's eight of them. They got shotguns and pistols. Juan and his nephew, they got Kalashnikovs. What have we got? Bullet. Rolling papers. And, uh... Power lines. You got your lighter? Do not tell me you lost it again. [LAUGHING] No, I got it. So what? Huh? I'm just happy. MAN: Good. Mrs. MacDougall will be very pleased with the transmission now. Any problems? You? We had an accident. Actually three. But she's fine. Sleeping. Cassidy called. And? He's at a peyote conference in Oaxaca. I thought he was coming back. I guess not yet. How'd he sound? Sounded okay. Apparently, he threw up with Woody Harrelson. [CHUCKLES] Sounds about right. She looks just like you. [TELEPHONE RINGING] I know I keep saying that. I don't mind. Uh, phone for Jesse. Hello? TULIP: ♪ And I will drink clear clean water ♪ For to quench my thirst ♪ I shall watch the ferry-boats And they'll get high ♪ On a blue ocean against tomorrow's sky ♪ And we'll never grow so old again ♪ What? They found Him. I have to go. I wanna go. Where is He? San Antonio. Welcome. Come, my child. Sit with me. JESSE: [IN ALTERED VOICE] Go about your lives. Go ahead. Make it day. Make it night. Well, now that we have that out of the way. Beer? Soda pop? Diet Dr. Pepper? [BOTH SIGH] JESSE: I have so many questions. [GOD CHUCKLES] Ask. Uh... I mean, kids with cancer. Oh. Yeah. Suffering is a great teacher. It gives a person strength. Or it kills you. And teaches strength to those left behind. All right. All the other religions, now, they're wrong? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. There's a lot that, uh, that is right, that I, uh, admire about the other faiths. But they're going to Hell? No, no, no. Not, uh... Not necessarily. Right. [CHUCKLES] What about life on other planets? [LAUGHS] No. What? Organic gases, water deposits, sure. Oh, come on. I mean, all the planets? Even the ones we don't know about? What, you want aliens with bug eyes and laser guns coming to get you? Sorry. [CHUCKLES] Wow. Yeah, that's surprising. Out of bean dip. Something from Piggly Wiggly? No. No, babe. Thank you. Anything? Uh, no. No. Thank you. Well, what else? Uh... Stonehenge? The Holocaust? What are the key components of consciousness? Is my dad in Heaven? Your original sin. [SIGHS] Your father is, uh, a man who dedicated his life to helping others. He never drank or cursed or so much as cracked a Playboy. And you prayed to me so hard that he might burn in the fires of Hell. [SIGHS] I denied your prayer. He's in Heaven. Of course. [EXHALES] Here's what I want you to know, and it might be difficult to understand, but the moment that I let your father die, and each and every single moment of your life that followed, was an expression of my love. I love you, Jesse Custer. Do you believe me? Good. Now, it's your turn. To say it back. Say you love me. Your great design is being loved. Right? That's it. That... That's the why. I gave you pain. I gave you joy. Your family? That happiness that you feel? That was my idea. You know, whenever I imagined this moment, it was just like this. We'd talk, you'd answer my questions. I'd hear about my dad, and you'd help me understand. What will be is what has always been. I will go back to Heaven. And all you need to do is say it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I understand. Good. I understand that we would all be better off without a needy little bitch like you around. [IN DISTORTED VOICE] There. [GRUNTS] There. Aah! Up. Down. [GRUNTS] JESSE: [IN NORMAL VOICE] You keep driving around, doing whatever it is you're doing down here. But I'm warning you, stay out of Heaven, and leave us alone. You dare... Only because of your perverse power. Be free. Why? I don't fucking need it. [GRUNTS] [IN DISTORTED VOICE] I will rip you apart. I will gorge on your innards and pick my teeth with your bones! Still won't make me love you. [VOICE FALTERS] I am a loving God, Jesse, but my patience with you, my patience with all humanity, is nearing its end. You will return my affection, or your replacement awaits. Man, you're tough. I get it. We got flaws, thousands of them. Millions. Of course. But on the most part, I think humanity's a goddamn miracle. And for that, in my opinion, you should be proud. But if you got something better cooking up in there, by all means, go for it. Meantime, I'm gonna go see a movie. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [CREATURE CAWING] [CREATURE CONTINUES CAWING] Please, not now. [GRUNTS] Daddy, I love you. Shut up! All of you. I love you, Daddy [GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION] I love you, Daddy What do you want? [GRUNTING] [CREATURE SCREECHING] Daddy- Daddy- Dad- Dad... I love you I love you Daddy We love you Shut up! Shut up! Buddy, I'm telling you, it doesn't match. So give me my goddamn money back. Sir, keep in mind, this is a semi-gloss finish, so I suggest, take it on home, and see how you like it before you make a decision. And if you don't like it, you can always bring it back. We'll give you a full refund. Uh-huh. And how long is that good for? Ninety days. Great. Sorry I raised my voice. Believe me, I understand. See you. All right. Take care. Dick. Who's next? STARR: Think I may have to marry this nine iron. Left elbow in, that's the key. [TIRES SCREECH] Pensacola PD, Starr. We've been looking a long time for you.

He did me wrong, so I shot him and killed him. Split him wide open with a dull blade. And after, I had my way with his wife, while his children were crying on me. God forgive me. I dearly loved him. Amen. Preacher. He figured you'd come back here sometime. Figured that you and I had some unfinished business. He figured right. You dare? It is given unto none to judge me! Stand aside! Uh... Can you not understand, William? Can you know what it was like to be the creator in the time before creation? I was alone. Infinite loneliness. And so, out of nothing, I created love. My greatest gift, William. Allow me to take my throne and give it to you. Your family, your little girl. I love them so. [CRYING] [VOICE BREAKS] I know. What was taken shall now be returned. Stand aside, and let me give you an eternity of love. What if [IN DISTORTED VOICE] I choose hate? [GOD YELLS] [THUNDER RUMBLING] JOHN WAYNE: [ON SCREEN] That's what's important. To feel useful in this old world. To hit a lick against what's wrong, or to say a word for what's right, even though you get walloped for saying that word. Now, I may sound like a Bible-beater yelling up a revival at a river-crossing camp meeting, but that don't change the truth none. There's right, and there's wrong. You got to do one or the other. You do the one, and you're living. You do the other, and you may be walking around, but you're dead as a beaver hat. So I hear you're a banker now. Is that right? Well, I run an asset management fund. We advise small businesses on charitable giving, titling of assets, and income replacement strategies. I've been praying. Yeah? Don't really know why, but... Just have. Hmm. No, I get it. I think your daddy would, too. You think? Oh, yeah. He said you, uh, used to drink gasoline... [CASSIDY CHUCKLES] ...and killed 20 angels with a chainsaw. Is that true? No, that's not bloody true. He's exaggerating. It was engine coolant. [LAUGHS] He says you were the toughest guy he ever met. Really? Yeah. That means a lot coming from him. Mom, too. She talked about you a lot. All the time, actually. Guess she wondered why you never came back to see them. I always meant to. I just... I always... I run out of time. You know? I get it. She loved you. Very much. Over 150 years, and I've been stabbed, bloody chopped up, blown up, dropped out of airplanes, and I just, I just kept going. Because that's what you do. You just... You got to pick yourself up, you know? Just forget the pain, try and carry on. But your bloody mom, did you know she shot me twice in the chest? Right in the heart. Two times. [CHILDREN YELLING] That was years ago. It still hurts. Guys, quit your messing, and be respectful! I'm sorry. Oh, it's all right. [SNIFFLES] I think I'll get going. Where to now? Bangkok? Tijuana?
