Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Everything's okay. - What's going on? - It's a riot! Somebody jumped out that window! Gangway! Get back! Come on! Come on, gangway! Gangway! And if you make another move, I'll let you have the third volume! - Miss Winton, stop, this is outrageous! - Yes, he is! When a girl can't make an honest living just because a nasty old man... - Please, Miss Winton... - Don't please me! In fact you couldn't! Mr. Mason, Miss Winton! What on earth, what's going on? Oh, just the usual office routine. Mr. Mason was giving me dictation. But he was a little too fast. Miss Winton chose to misunderstand purely a friendly gesture. Miss Winton, this is disgraceful! I'm sure Mr. Mason meant no harm. Oh, yeah? Mr. Mason, the cops is here. Oh, don't worry, I'm not going to turn you in. All I want to do is to get out of this firetrap. Peace and Purity League, humph! Just a moment, young lady. - What do you know about all this? - Not a thing, officer. Annie doesn't work here anymore. - Hiya, kid. - Hello, Sadie. You beat me home. You must have quit earlier than usual today. No, I just got fired earlier than usual. What? Marge, do you mean to say that you've been fired again? Hm-hmm. Why, I thought this Mr. Mason liked you so much that he... So much that I had to throw two five-pound books at him to keep him away. Five pound... What did he do? Oh, he started to show me a few new handies. But after the first, I told him to stop. I could guess the rest. Oh, ain't men terrible? Though I must confess that my boss certainly behaved like a gentleman to me. Darn it. Well, what are you going to now, Marge? Say, there's an ad here that sounds pretty good. Only it's in the same building I just got fired from. Stenographer wanted by Henderson, Barton and Lowell. - What's their business? - It says they're importers of spices, seeds, oils and sardines. Sardines? That sure sounds romantic. I don't want romance. All I want is a job. Pardon me. - Good night, Marge. - Good night. - Oh, Miss Winton. - Yes, Mr. Lowell? I wonder if you'd mind staying on for an hour or so. I'd like to go over the Driscoll Sardine statement. Why, you okayed it this morning. I mailed it out with the banana oil contracts. Oh, did I? Hm, must have slipped my mind. Well, um... anyway, I'd like you to stay on. There are a few things I'd like to go over with you. Well, I was planning to go out to dinner. There's no reason why we can't have dinner up here. - Oh, but I... - I'll give you a buzz in a few minutes. Yes, Mr. Lowell. - Yes, Mr. Barton? - I have a few letters I want to get out. Do you mind staying on for an hour or so? I'm awfully sorry, but Mr. Lowell asked me to do some work for him. Mr. Lowell happens to be the second vice-president. I come first. Yes, Mr. Barton. Oh, Miss Winton... Marge. You look like a nice understanding girl. I know, your wife's out of town for a few days and you're lonesome. - How did you know? - Oh, just because I'm so understanding. Well, um... I have a couple of very important contracts... ...I'd like to get off to New York in the midnight plane. Will you bring your book in, please? Yes. Oh... I'll just sharpen my pencil. Miss Winton. Ready now, Miss Winton. If you'll just bring your pad in, Miss Winton. Miss Winton? - Where's Miss Winton? - She quit. She say I stay here. You want night work, I do it. - Something to drink, madam? - Certainly not! - I never drink! - You didn't make a mistake, did you? Why, no, I've never regretted it. No, I mean... this is a cocktail bar. - You know. - Why sure! I'm meeting my girlfriend here. Oh, bring me another bowl of popcorn, will you? This one is almost finished. Thank you. How's the new book coming, Freddy? Why did you have to remind me of that just when I was having such a good time? But you must finish it, darling. Don't you realize the whole world is waiting for your next masterpiece? Yes, yes, I'll bet. What's more important, the publisher is waiting for it. I needed that advance royalty too. Somehow or other, I don't seem to be able to get around to it. - Too many pleasant distractions. - Silly. What's it all about anyway? Well, it's about a beautiful girl by the name of Camille... ...who falls in love with a young, um... ...wastrel. Named Freddy? How did you guess? Howdy, pal! - Well how's the new job? - It was fine. Was fine? What happened this time? Oh, you know the old proverb. Too many bosses spoil a stenographer. So, when she refused to marry him, why, he... ...got a job on a ukelele ranch down in Honolulu. You know, breaking in wild ukeleles. And then one day he fell in love with the... ...overseer's... daughter. A blonde? Hm? The overseer's daughter, was she a blonde? Oh, yes, yes... Yes, she was... She's a... Yes, um... You know, I think I know that girl. You mean you'd like to meet her, don't you? No, no, seriously, I think I've met her somewhere before. - Have some popcorn. - Thanks. Oh, um... Quite an accident, I... Here. Oh, it's nothing at all. Please, don't bother. - That's quite alright. - Oh, say, thanks. He's very nice, isn't he, Marge? - Oh, how could you? - Oh, I'm very sorry, I... That's quite alright. I... like popcorn. Oh, I'm a fool for it too. This isn't quite salty enough, though. There you are... That's, um... Oh, that's mine. Um... - Haven't I met you somewhere before? - I don't think so. I don't wish to intrude, Freddy, but I'm the girl you brought here, remember? Oh, yes, I... I was just picking up... Yes, so I noticed. But if you're through with your picking up, we'll leave. Uh... have some popcorn. Uh... thank you... thank you. Thank you. You know something? I don't think she likes popcorn. And that's not all. Johnson's Employment Agency. Oh, yes. Yes, I think I have just the girl for you. I'll send her down first thing in the morning. You! Come here. Not you. You with the lampshade on your head. The Belldon Publishing Company at 283, Market St. wants a girl. They'll see you tomorrow morning about nine o'clock. I was just fired from there. Oh. Is there anything else? Sit down, I'll take a look. Say, how about me? - You're not the type. - What do you mean I'm not the type? I have lots of experience. I know office routine upside down. Your face is against you. - What's wrong with? - Nothing, that's just the point. The Belldon Publishing Company never hires good-looking girls. This is one job where looks don't count. - Oh, hello, Marge. - Hello. Well, any luck? Say, what's in those packages? Oh, just some new clothes and things. Now, Marge, you have some lovely clothes already. You don't have to buy any more stuff, especially now... ...when you're a little short of money. Well, I've got a hunch that these are going to be good investment. - Wait until you see me. - I can't wait. Try them on now. Alright. Oh, good night! Who's that? Probably some college boy who's working his way through a reform school. - Hello, sweetie pie. - Oh, it's you again. How's the little butter ball? - Jake, have you been drinking? - Why? That's the first time you've kissed me since the night... ...I held your hand while you were getting tattooed. Oh, nix, nix. We got a guest. This is Al McCoy, my boss. Al, shake hands... ...with the best little dame that ever washed your neck. - Pleased to meet you. - How do you do, I'm sure. I brought Al for Marge. After we eat, we can all sit down and hear me play the piano. We're in for a big evening, I can see that. Sit down over there, Al. There'll be a furniture elbow in case you wanna smoke. - Where's Marge? - Getting dressed. - Too bad Mr. McCoy already had dinner. - Think nothing of it, Miss. I can put out a nosebag eight times a day, can't I, Jake? Yeah! Al had a tough afternoon, see, Sadie? Yeah, stuffed grain over at the Acme can works. It was a honey, wasn't it, Jake? Uh-huh. Al's the best doggone plumber in the business. Boy, can he wipe a sweet joint. Yeah, did you ever try a eight-inch elbow connected with a wide joint? Well, not lately, see. I've been a little busy. Oh, I'll go and tell Marge what a treat she's in for. Oh, wait a minute, let me do it. Wait until you get an eyeful of her. She's beautiful! Ain't she beautiful, Sadie? Tell Al how beautiful she is. I think Jake means that Marge is beautiful, Mr. McCoy. Oh, you mean she's pretty, uh? See. he caught on right away. I'll bring her right out. Hey, Marge, hurry up and get dressed, will ya? I got a swell guy out here that's dying to meet you. Alright. Listen, I used to think you were a nitwit, and that wasn't flattery. - Well, it wasn't. - It was a tribute. Say, what's the matter? Don't you like Al? What's the matter with you? Shhh! If his ears were shorter, he'd look like a horse. - Ah! - Ah! What are you looking for? That wine that went sour on you. I wanna... Oh, now, wait a minute, wait a minute. Plumber or no plumber, he can't drink that. I'll put a little piece of lemon with it... ...and with some ginger ale on the side, he'll think it's a boilermaker. Boilermaker is right. - Hey, Jake, you got a pencil? - Coming right up, pal. You mean that big goof can write? I don't believe it. Here you are, pal. What are you gonna do, make an estimate? No, draw. Ain't he a card? A card? He's the whole deck. There you are. Hey, Marge! Hurry up, will ya? - Coming. - Come on, Al, on your feet. Now wait until you get a load of this. Hello, everybody. Hello, Ma... Why, Jake, aren't you going to introduce me? This is my boss, Mr. McCoy. Marge. Marge... - Mr. McCoy. - Oh, how do you do, Mr. McCoy? Did I hear Jake say that you were taking us all down to the beach? Say, won't that be marvelous? I just was dying for one of those nice shore dinners. And then afterwards, we can go in the old mill. You know, the place where you ride around in the little boats... - ...in the dark, you know? - Yeah, sure. Jake, I... I forgot to turn the lights out in the car. Well, if you really want them on, I'll do it for you. No, I'll do it myself. Why, Mr. McCoy! What are you hiding in the broom closet for? Well, for Pete's sake, how do you get out of this place? This way, Mr. McCoy, and don't be long, will you, dear? Don't forget! Marge, will you kindly explain? Yeah, what's the idea, Marge? Here I've been billing you up to my boss... telling him what a swell-looking dame you are... - and out you come looking like a... - A passport picture. Where do you think you're going, to a fancy-dress ball? No, my pets, I'm going to get a job. I hope. As what, posing for the funny papers? Uh-uh. The Belldon Publishing Company need a girl. - But they want a homely one. - The boss's wife must run that office. It's a screwy idea, if you ask me. Marge, I hate to admit this, but for the first time in his life Jake is right. Maybe so. But I've tried every other way of holding a job... ...and if this one doesn't work, I don't know what I'm going to do. Hey Al! Marge! Sadie! - What is it? - What's the matter, what's happening? He's took a runout on us. Now see what you went and done? You scared him away. Why, Jake, I was trying to be very nice to him. - Nice? - I know... she was just trying out some of her new scenery on the dog. I'll thank you not to call Al a dog. Oh, Sadie, it works. I'm as good as working for that publishing house right now. Belldon Publishing Company. Oh... yes. That'll be alright, thank you. I'm from the Johnson Employment Agency. In regard to a secretarial position. There's a girl here about the job. Send her in and get Freddy Matthews for me. - Right away. - Is Mabel DeCraven here yet? No, she hasn't come in yet. As soon as she gets here I'll send her in. - You may go in. - Thank you. Right in that door. Oh, excuse me. - Well, come in. - I wanted to see Mr. Belldon. You're talking to him, sit down. I'm Miss Winton. I understand you want a girl. - I want a good secretary. - I'm that, madam. I graduated from college and business school. Well, you'll probably do. - Mabel DeCraven. - Mabel DeCraven? Show her in. - Well! - Now don't you scold me. - Mabel? - Yes, Mabel. It's about time you showed up! It's getting so I have to stand over you writers... ...like a policeman to make you get your stuff out on time! You're cheating on the little girls of America. Where are the last chapters of the Motorcycle Girls in the Everglades? Oh, it's wonderful. I got them all, every one of them on their motorcycles in the middle of the swamp. This is chapter twelve. And I got them up to there... in water. But I don't know how to get them out. Have them swim out. Yeah, but what about the motorcycles? They can't swim. Leave them in the swamp. Your next series will be, um... The Aeroplane Girls in Africa. And pick a new name for yourself. Mabel DeCraven! Well, it was a toss up between that and Rosabel Hart. I kinda thought Rosabel Hart was a little too effeminate. Why can't I use my own name, Mike McGillicutty? The Aeroplane Girls in Africa by Mike McGillicutty? McGillicutty is a fine old name. Yes, but for the next series pick a new pseudonym. Prudence Parker? No, not Prudence. Let me see... Priscilla! Excellent! How does it sound to you, Mabel? That's fine! Prisci... They might call me Prissy for short. They won't. I'll make it a house rule. Yes... yes! Freddy Matthews at last. That's fine. Now you can ball him out. Well, it's about time I heard from you, you lazy good-for-nothing. Now look here, honeybunch, don't you talk to me like that. You don't know how hard I've been working. Working? Ha, I don't believe it. Really I have. I have been going ahead with it. I've been held up. For one thing, I haven't got a good secretary. Oh, no secretary, eh? Well, by a very strange coincidence I think I have one for you right here. Just a minute. One of my authors needs a new secretary right away. Do you want the job? - Why, yes! I'm sure I can do it. - Good. Yes, Freddy, I've got just the girl for you, I'm bringing her right over. Oh, now, look here, Abbie, wait a minute. I'll be there in twenty minutes. I'll meet you in the outer office in a minute. You join Miss Winter. For the love of Mike, Abbie, that's a dirty trick to play on Freddy! - What are talking about? - That girl. - What's the matter with her? - Everything! Sex takes a holiday! Freddy will throw a fit. Imagine working all day in front of a face like that. Exactly. That's just why I picked her out for Freddy. She won't take his mind off his work. In fact it's gonna be her job to keep his mind on it. I'd give anything to get a look at Freddy's face when he sees that comic valentine. Ah, good morning, Miss Belldon. Good morning, Alonzo. And if Mr. Matthews told you to tell me he wasn't in, don't bother. He's in, Miss. He's concentrating. Please enter. Concentrating, eh? Well that's something new. Concentrating? Doggone it, Abbie, you spoiled my aim. Miss Belldon, sir, and a young woman. Yes, so I gathered. Freddy, this is your new secretary. Miss Winton, Mr. Matthews. How dou you... do... Miss... Winton? Why, it's you! You... - Oh... - Do you two know each other? No, I... I don't think we've ever had the pleasure. Oh, no, it isn't that but, um... Mr. Matthews reminds me of... somebody I... met once. Oh. Won't you all sit down? Certainly not, no time for that. I must get back to the office. I just wanted to get Miss Winton started. You mean to tell me that she's going to start right now? Perhaps Mr. Matthews would rather that I begin tomorrow. Certainly not, he doesn't want to waste a minute, do you, Freddy? I'll bet you'll want Miss Winton to work in the study. Right in here, Miss Winton. You'll find a typewriter... The typewriter is broken, I... Mr. Matthews will be with you in a moment. I have a little business to discuss with him before I go. Goodbye and good luck. And drop in at the office after five to report. Y-Yes, Miss Belldon. Oh, blah! Well! Doggone it, Abbie Belldon, you can't do this to me. - Do what? - Well, running my affairs for me, ...hiring secretaries. You said you wanted a secretary. I thought I was doing you a favor. - You call that a favor? - You'll find her very efficient. But her looks. That face wouldn't stop a clock, it would start it running backwards. You're supposed to be writing a book, not running a beauty contest. No doubt she's a very efficient secretary, she must have some redeeming qualities, but... - But what? - I haven't got any work for her to do. - Not until tomorrow anyway. - Tomorrow nothing. You're going to have to work for her to do today, and right now. - Oh, Abbie! - You listen to me, Freddy Matthews! On the strength of a ten page synopsis of what your story would be like... ...I sold the picture rights to Superfine Pictures for $30,000. Have you overlooked that? I haven't overlooked it, I've overdrawn it. Exactly. Unless your book is finished by the first of May... They can't get blood out of a turnip. Then stop being a turnip and get to work! That's one date you've got to keep. Now get to it! Alright, Simon Legree, but listen. - What? She's got to wear a diving helmet during working hours! Oh, get to work! I'm all ready, Mr. Matthews. What shall I do first? Well, um... let me think. I wouldn't want to tell you the first thing that comes into my head. Miss Belldon tells me that you're very eager to get started on your new book. Yes, frantic I believe is the word. - Have you got a title yet? - I'm thinking of calling it... - David Copperfield. - Oh. - That ought to make a good movie. - Yes, I... What are you doing to your face? Why... nothing. What do you want me to do with it? Well, there's no point in making it any... You know, you wouldn't be a bad-looking girl... - ...if you'd give yourself half a chance. - Oh, Mr. Matthews. You know, frizz up that hair a little bit. Take off those... Do you have to wear those glasses? - Well, I always have. - You weren't born with them, were you? I can't remember that far back. Well, take them off. - What's that? - A picket fence. Put them on again. Why, it's almost one o'clock. Yes, just think of that. And in Siam it's only eight o'clock. Lucky people those Siamese. I've been up for hours and they're still sleeping. Well, I think it's time to knock off work and have a little lunch. - Knock off work? - Yes, all work and no play, you know. You wouldn't mind lunching with me, would you? Well, um... alright. If you promise to tell me about your new book. Must we talk shop? - I'm not at home to anyone who calls. - Yes. Yes... That's a telephone. - A telephone! - Oh, yes... I'm sorry. Hello? No, no, no, that's not the telephone. You hid the telephone underneath there. Oh, yes. Don't be frightened if you hear a voice when you pick it up. Hello? This is Mr. Matthews' secretary. I'm sorry, but he's not in. Will you please tell him Miss Lansing called. And I expect him to meet me for cocktails at the usual hour. - Yes, he knows where. - Alright. Who was it? That was Miss Lansing. I told her that you weren't in. Miss Lansing? Why did you tell her that for? Well, you told me to say that you weren't at home to anybody. Yes, but Miss Lansing is always an exception. What did she want? Well, she told me to tell you that she expected you for cocktails... ...at the usual time and place. Good. Well, we'll have some lunch. Alonzo! - Yes, sir? - We'll have lunch out on the terrace. I want a table for two right on the dance floor. Yes, sir. She decided that she would rather have marriage than a career... ...so she went back to him. Oh, that's a beautiful story, Mr. Matthews. I'm sure it will be a great success. It always has been. Oh, goodness, it's almost three o'clock. Miss Winton, you are a clock watcher. You will never succeed with that attitude. Mr. Matthews, don't you think we ought to try to get a little work done? Don't you think you're taking a little bit too much on yourself? - I, um... - I know Abbie Belldon, I know her tricks and I know what she's put you up to... ...and I won't stand for it. I'm the boss around here and I will work when and... and if I please. Miss Winton, what on earth is the matter? Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Matthews. I didn't mean to be so silly but... You see, I needed this job so much. Well, you got the job, I'm perfectly satisfied. - But what shall I tell Miss Belldon? - Why do you have to tell her anything? Well, I told her that I'd report back tonight... and when she finds out that we haven't done any work... she'll fire me! Alright, alright, alright, I'll work. I'll work. Women. Sylvia watched Charles as he stood before the open window... Stop that noise! What have I said? Sylvia watched Charles as he stood before the open window... - Stop that noise. - No, no, no, no! Stop that noise! I can't work out here. Peace and quiet of a boiler factory. We'll work here. Now, where were we? Sylvia watched Charles as he stood before the open window... - Stop that... - No, no, no, no, no. Sylvia watched Charles as he stood before the open window... - Alonzo, stop that row! - Yes, sir. Sylvia watched Charles as he stood before the open window... Sylvia watched Charles as he... Oh, yes... I... Come on! - Come on, get out of here. - Where are we going? - We're going for a ride. - Going for a ride? For a ride! Sylvia secretly watched Charles as he undressed before the open window. As he removed his shirt revealing his bronze biceps, the wind ruffled his golden hair. What do you think? I think Charles should put his shirt back on before he catches cold. Well, isn't this better than that stuffy apartment? Better but not so effective. You've written exactly two paragraphs. Oh, I have, have I? Well, I don't want to overdo this thing. - Let's call it a day and go home. - Please, Mr. Matthews. - Let's finish this chapter. - Nothing doing, I'm going to take you home. But I told Miss Belldon... Miss Belldon, who cares about Miss Belldon? You can tell her first thing in the morning that I've done my homework. - I think it's raining. - Ignore it. Well, wouldn't it be more sensible to put up the top? It would be a lot more sensible if I had a top. I took it off, it rattled. Here. I am prepared for any emergency. Thank goodness. Moths. - Marge! - For the love of Pete! What happened? Did you swim home? Don't you know enough to come out of the rain? As a matter of fact, my boss brought me home. What, did the canoe tip over? Marge don't know enough to come in out of the rain. Oh, shut up, both of you. I'll get out of these wet clothes and I'll explain later. Her boss must run around in an open bathtub. Speaking of cars... Were we? That reminds me, you know, I'm worried. Did you know gasoline has gone up three cents a gallon? No, but what difference does that make to you? You haven't got a car. I know. But I took a chance on one in the raffle. And I may win it. Hey! Hey, buddy! See, there's somebody that appreciates music. - Ten bucks it's a request. - Yeah. Can you play Harvest Moon? I don't know, but I'll try. - Give us a load of that. - I'll sing the tenor. # Shine on # # Shine on harvest moon # # Up in the sky # # I ain't had no lovin' since... # - Hey, you! Whoever's playing that piano. Are you the nice man who's playing that piano? Yeah, any request? What's the matter, Jake, don't you know enough to come in out of the rain? He's gone out. A luncheon engagement? Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Lansing. He must have forgotten about it. At the St. George Hotel? Alright, I'll tell him. Goodbye. That typewriter's taking plenty punishment. - Typewriter and me both. - Been making you work? Well, I don't mind. The sooner I finish this book the sooner I'll get rid of her. Not so good between paragraphs, huh? It has never occurred to me to try. She'll make somebody an awfully good wife. Probably a blind man. Maybe she could be induced to take those glasses off. It wouldn't do any good, I've tried that. She's so nearsighted she can't see the end of her nose on a clear day. Why, Mr. Matthews, I didn't know you were out here. Miss Lansing just called and I told her you were out. Good night! I had a luncheon engagement with her. Where did she say she'd be? The, um... the Bayview. - The Bayview. Well, if she calls again, tell her I'm on my way. - Do you want to come along, Mabel? - No, I'm gonna loaf around here for a while. Okay, see you later. Do you think it's nice for secretaries to tell fibs? Why, Mr. DeCraven, I didn't! I told her that Mr. Matthews was out, and so he was. Out there. Well, he got away from the chain gang today. And you may rest assured... Miss Lansing will see that he's charmingly entertained at the Bayview The Bayview? Oh, goodness! Did I tell Mr. Matthews the Bayview? - You certainly did. - Oh, isn't that awful, I... I meant to tell him the St. George. I'm afraid you'll think I'm awfully stupid. Yes, I do. Stupid like a fox. Must be a fascinating book you're reading, Miss Winton. It's your first novel, Mr. Matthews. Well, they've always told me that sleep was one form of criticism. Oh, no, it's a delightful book, but... Well, I went out to lunch with Mr. DeCraven and... I'm afraid I ate too much. Lunch, eh? You know what I had for lunch? - Why, no. - Nothing. A large portion of nothing. I'd been sitting in the lobby of the Bayview Hotel for three hours... ...waiting for Miss Lansing. - Oh, she didn't turn up? - She didn't turn up. She hasn't phoned me here, has she? - Why, um... no. - Miss Lansing, sir. - Well! - Hello... darling. Don't you darling me! How dare you keep me waiting in that miserable hotel lobby... ...for over two hours, being stared at, humiliated! You've stood me up for the last time, Freddy Matthews! I was there at one o'clock. I just got back, didn't I? What do you mean, stood you up? I've been sitting in the lobby of the Bayview Hotel for three hours for you! The Bayview? But I said the St. George. Didn't I? You told me the Bayview, didn't you? Well, I... I must have misunderstood, I'm terribly sorry. In my opinion, you misunderstood deliberately! Oh, that's ridiculous, why would she misunderstand deliberately... Why, why, why did she tell me you were out when I telephoned yesterday? Your butler tells me you were in all day. Did Miss Lansing call me yesterday? Why, um... yes, she did, three times. Now look here, Miss Winton, I... - What's the idea? - Why, the girl's jealous, of course. Just another little stenographer in love with her boss. You'd better quit reading those cheap magazine stories, Miss whatever your name is. His book has to be finished by a definite time, which means that a certain amount of writing has to be done every day. And if I didn't protect him from all unnecessary interruptions... Are you calling me an unnecessary interruption? Frankly, yes. - Oh, of all the impudent, impertinent... - Now, wait a minute... No, shhh. Keep still! If you think I'm going to stand here and be insulted by... I'm not insulting anybody, I'm simply telling the truth. Every time you call Mr. Matthews... ...it means that he drops everything and he's gone for the rest of the day. And now that I've gone that far, I'd like to have my say. It seems to me you've had it. Not quite. Whatever I did was for Mr. Matthews' best interests. If I took a little bit too much upon myself, I'm sorry. I... I guess I'd better be going. Now, look here, Miss Winton, you mustn't go like this. Oh, I don't mind a bit. In fact, Miss Lansing's jealousy is quite flattering. Goodbye, Mr. Matthews. If you decide that you still want me to work for you, you know my address. Wire me. Goodbye, Miss, Miss whatever your name is! There goes the best secretary I ever had. Oh, so that's all you have to say... ...after standing there and allowing me to be insulted by that cheap, common... - Now, Camille! - Shut up! First of all you keep me waiting for three hours. - Camille, will you be reasonable? - Reasonable! Didn't you have sense enough to telephone the St. George? You know I always go there! But Miss Winton told me the Bayview. Miss Winton, Miss Winton! Don't mention that woman's name to me! But she's very capable, I need her. That's right, defend her! Get her back, see if I give a hoot, if you dare! And I'm warning you, Freddy Mathews, if I ever lay eyes on that woman again, I'll make a scene you'll never forget! - I can... - Next time I'll lose my temper. Come, come, Alonzo, it's just an ordinary, common... ...stenographer's notebook with a lot of dictation in it. Are there repeated lines, sir? - Yeah, have you found it? - Would this by any chance be it, sir? That's the lubrication book for the car. Women, women, women. Let this be a lesson to you, Alonzo. Once you rely on them, sooner or later they'll drive you crazy. Yes, sir. It's a reflection I've often anticipated, sir. What's that you're sitting on, sir? - What do you think I ordinarily sit... - I beg your pardon. Miss Winton's notebook. Alright, come on, now. Let's get down to business Here, read me the last two paragraphs I dictated to her. Go on, go on, read it! It's all in shorthand, sir. Nobody but Miss Winton can understand it. That's great, isn't it? That's great! My own novel and I can't even read it. Get my hat and coat. I'm gonna find that girl. Hi, Sadie. Hi... - Here's the want ads section. - Thank you, dear. Fired again, I suppose. No, this time I left under my own power. What happened? I thought you were all set. You liked the boss, the boss liked you. You told me the work was getting along so swell. Yes, but the boss has a girl. Oh, I see. Marge, have you got a case on this guy? Oh, don't be ridiculous. I never thought about him twice in that way, er... ...very much. - Say, what have you got for supper? - Oh, canned soup, canned corn beaf hash, canned string beans and... this bag has bananas. What's the matter, can't you find any canned bananas? Okay, I'll start getting things ready while you wash up. I'm washed up already. Oh, Marge, answer that, will you? It's probably Jake. He would come in while I'm making my toilette. Alright. If you've come for supper, I hope you brought your own canned... Oh! Oh... No. No, I'm afraid I didn't. Does Miss Marjorie Winton live here? I'm Mr. Matthews. Uh, yes... she does. - Why, I know you. - You do? Of course, you're the girl who dropped her bag that day... ...in the cocktail bar and I picked up all those things. Oh, was that you? Yes, I guess I didn't make much of an impression, did I? Well, you see, you weren't at the table most of the time. Oh, um, do you want to see Miss Winton? - Yes, is she in? - Well, uh... Not exactly. - Not exactly? - Well, what I mean is... I'm expecting her. She went out. I think she's looking for another position. Oh, she shouldn't do that. Do you mind if I come in and wait? Oh, of course not. But I don't know how long it will be before she gets back. Oh, that's all right. I don't mind waiting. - Not a bit. - Um, won't you... won't you sit down? Thank you. Oh... You must be the young lady who lives with Miss Winton, aren't you? Yes, that's right. I'm Marge's roommate. I see... I've heard her mention you, I think. - Isn't your name Miss... Day? - Yes, um, Sadie Day. Well, hello, dumbbell... Oh... I'm sorry... I thought that, uh... Oh... excuse me! - Does she live here too? - Oh, no, no... She just dropped in to... brush her teeth. Doesn't she ever brush her teeth at home? I've often wondered that too, Mr. Matthews. Oh, I'm terribly sorry, you see... I thought you were somebody else. Mr. Matthews, this is, uh... Miss... Wilson. - How do you do, Miss Wilson? - How do you do... Mr. Matthews is Marge's boss, you know... ...er, Suzie. Suzie? Um, he just dropped in to see Marge and... I told him she was out, so he said he didn't mind waiting a little while... so we were just having a visit while he was waiting. - You know. - Yes, I know... - Uh... nice girl Miss Winton. - Oh, yes, yes. But she's an awful liar. - Oh... - Why, Suzie! - That's Jake! - Now, come on, Suzie, You know how Jake hates to be kept waiting. - Goodbye. - Don't keep him waiting, come on. You got to go... Get out! Well, alright. Goodbye, Mr. Matthews, I hope you don't have too long a wait. But you know how Marge is when she's out on one of her benders. Alright... goodbye! - Come on! - Hey, wait a minute. What's the idea? Never mind, come along. I've come to spend the evening. I gotta practice. Well, you can start practicing taking me out to dinner. - Marge has company. - Oh, I see. I ain't good enough for her swell friends, huh? It's not that, Jake. Marge's boss is in there waiting for Marge. - Ain't Marge home yet? - Yes, she's home, but he doesn't know that she's Marge. That is, he doesn't know that Marge is his secretary. She's been working for him, where's she been hiding, under the typewriter? No, stupid, he knows that Marge is his secretary, but what he doesn't know is that Marge is Marge. Holy cats, who does he think she is? - Me. - I'm going crazy! - Is that news? Come on! - Oh... She was just kidding about Marge, you know. I'm sure of it. Miss Winton is the last person in the world I can imagine going on a bender. Oh, really? Why? Well, she is, you know... sort of stiff and proper. - Oh, just a regular old maid, in fact. - Yes. But she's a marvelous secretary and I need her badly. I can imagine. We had a little unpleasantness this afternoon. That's why I dropped in. Now I'm glad I did. Oh, Mr. Matthews, I just happen to remember. Marge told me that she was going to the theater. It will be late before she gets back. That's marvelous. I haven't got a thing to do all evening. We can sit here and have a nice visit. And you seem to take it for granted that I haven't either. I beg your pardon. I didn't know I was keeping you from an engagement. Well, as a matter of fact you're not. But I haven't had supper yet. Do you mind if I start getting things ready? No, no, you go right ahead. Oh, um... perhaps you'd like to join me. Do you like canned corn beaf hash? Uh, frankly, no. However, I have a very good idea. Why don't you come out and have dinner with me? - Oh, but I couldn't do that. - Why not? Well, I hardly know you. You'll know me better after dinner, come on. Well, alright. But give me a minute to change my clothes, will you? - Go right ahead. - Oh, uh... There's one thing you've got to promise me. Not to tell Marge a thing about this. Well, I won't. But why not? Well, she wouldn't approve. Can you imagine Marge going out to dinner with a strange young man? If I was a strange young man, she wouldn't have a chance. Oh... you never can tell. - Will madam have a demitasse? - Why, yes, if you please. - What's that? - Coffee, you lug, coffee. There! I knew it! Coffee, ten cents. A clip joint! Jake, sometimes it appalls me the way you throw away money. But that's six bucks short already. You know what that means? Six piano lessons. Well, that'll help. For the love of Pete, look! Well, if that ain't a coordination. Let's join them. I'll play dumb and maybe the boyfriend will pay the check. - Come on. - Wait up. Boy, you certainly have to give a swell performance. Oh, don't be such a crab. Hey, yoohoo! Hey, sit where you are... dumbbell! You know, there are times when you remind me of your roommate. - Marge? - Yes, Marge. - Why, don't be offended. - Why should I be offended? I think Marge is an extremely fine-looking young girl. Oh, no, Miss Day. Fun is fun. - But compared to you... - Uh, don't you think we ought to dance? Yes, I'd love to. # When I tell you I adore you # # I'll admit it sounds naive # # But love's a repetition # # Of the same old story # # Ever since Eve # # If I cross my heart before you # # Could I ask you to believe # # I feel the way that Adam # # Must have felt # # Before he told it to Eve # # The moon that shines above you # # Once heard old Adam say # # The simple words I love you # # And that's what I'm saying today # Hey! Hey! How do you like that? Snubbed. And without even finesse. Do you mind if we stop dancing? - Of course not. - I'd much rather talk. - Oh, come on, let's dance. - Dance? - Yes. - I beg... oh... I know this isn't much of a place, but I thought you might like to see... ...where I got the idea for The Motorcycle Girls in Panama. I hope I didn't do wrong. Freddy Matthews broke a dinner date with me tonight... ...because he said he had to work and there he is out there dancing with that blonde. I did wrong. - Say, who does she think he is anyway? - I told you! He's her boss and she doesn't want him to know who she is! Then why does she wear the wig and the trick scenery when she's working for him? Because then she's supposed to be Marge. - Who is she now? - Me. Wait a minute, wait a minute! Take it slow. If she's you, who do you think I'm out with right now? Suzie. You go out there right this minute and cut in on them! I don't even know that lady. Wouldn't that be, um... uncouth? And furthermore, you tell him to come over here... ...and talk to me while you dance with that girl. And if he doesn't come... tell him I'm going to start throwing things! I'll go, I'll go, I'll go. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Are you nervous? No, but don't you think it's a little warm in here? - Would you like to leave? - Yes, I'd love to. I'm gonna cut in on them and find what this is all about. If you do, I warn you I'll be calling on you in the morgue. That'll be plenty of time for me to be sorry. Jake! Jake! - May I have this dance? - Why, uh... Certainly. Why... who are you? - Who are you? - I am Mabel Decraven. Oh... excuse me. Mike McGillicutty. - You know, it's strange. - What? I have a funny feeling that I am not I and you are not you. - Who do you think I am then? - We're two totally different people... ...in a world of our own. A world that started a few hours ago. Oh. A world just for the two of us and nobody else. - Not even Miss Lansing? - You know I dislike brunettes? I dislike them. They make me moody. I like girls who are blond, about five-feet three, and weigh about... 112 pounds? When I get my diet back. I weigh 118. Six more pounds to have and to hold. Oh, Freddy, what delightful nonsense. I was never more serious in my life. - Really? - Just to show you how serious I am, I'll tell you why I like you. I like your sincerity, I like your honesty. You're the kind of a girl who can be depended on. Oh, I wouldn't be too sure about that. I'm sorry, folks, I've run out of gas and the meter stopped. From now on you'll have to hire me by the hour. Well, that's splendid. Here. There's three hours in advance, and under no circumstances buy any gas. - No gas? - No gas. Don't you think we ought to go home? We can't go home. Didn't you hear him say he's run out of gas? If you help me push the cab over the rise there, I'm sure we can coast down to the filling station. - Perfectly splendid idea. - Freddy! - Thank you, Miss. - Come on, let's go. - You two shove, I'll get in and steer. - Good idea. Let's go! - May I help you? - Oh, hello, officer, yes. Thank you very much, we just ran out of gas. Thank you, that's fine. Here we go. Ah, that's wonderful. Just over the rise, that's all. Wait, will you, please? Don't forget to tell Marge to come to work in the morning, I'd say about ten o'clock. I'll tell her. But will you be there? I'll be there. I may be walking in my sleep, but I'll be there. When am I going to see you again? I don't know. I was planning to go away for a few days. Go away, just when I've met you? That's impossible. Let's discuss it. Do you mind if we discuss it some other time? It's really awfully late, you know. Oh, don't be silly. It's just the shank of the morning. Well, perhaps you're right. But before I go, Yes? There's something that I want to say to you, something that's going to be very difficult... - ...for me to say. - What's that? - Good night. - Oh, you idiot. Good night, and thank you for a very pleasant evening. - Good night. - Good night. - Is that you, Marge? - It certainly is. Say, what's the idea of trying to scare me to death? - Is that your idea of a good joke? - No, I just wanted to be sure to wake up... ...when you came home. Tell me, what happened? Oh, nothing particular. We had a very pleasant evening. - Yeah? - We went for dinner, and then we danced. - And? - Then we went for a ride in the park. And you say nothing happened? Don't tell me. There's only one thing that'll keep people out riding in the park... ...until four o'clock in the morning You're right, Sadie. He's fallen in love with me. Well, he didn't lose any time, did he? And you? Oh, I guess I'm that way about him too. - Did he propose? - No. I didn't let him get that far. Well, what's going to happen now? That's what I'm wondering. Hasn't he any idea that you are you? - You know what I mean? - Not the slightest. Well, you'll have to tell him. But I can't, don't you see? He'd be furious. Why, he just told me tonight. That if there was one thing he hated in a woman, it was deceit. I've got myself in a fine mess, haven't I? Well, there's just one thing for you to do. - Commit suicide. - What? Don't get excited. Just get rid of the real Marge for a while... - ...until after the book is finished. - But how? What shall I tell him? Oh, that's easy, just say that Sadie went away for a few weeks, then, when the book is finished, let your conscience be your guide. Why, what are you bawling about? Sadie, I... I'm so happy. Well, I'm happy that you're happy. Now let me see, where was I? - Where was I? - Oh, um... Charles went to bed, but he knew that after the violent quarrel with Sylvia... he would be unable to sleep. He lay down on the bed and closed his eyes... Oh... the lucky stiff. Uh... and, er... but sleep was impossible. He tried counting sheep. One, two, three, four... Five, six, seven, eight... - Nine, ten, eleven... - Hey, cut that out, will you? Do you realize I only had about four hours' sleep last night? I know. It must have been almost five o'clock before you got home. Five o'... How do you know what time I got in? - Why, I... - Oh, I suppose Sadie told you. She made me promise not to tell you she'd been out with me. Well, it was so terribly late... ...by the time she got in that I made her tell me where she'd been. Why didn't you tell me that your roommate... ...was the most beautiful girl in San Francisco? Do you realize I'd never met her unless I'd come to call on you last night? Oh, that's too horrible to even think about. Yes. Did she say, um... anything that I, um... ...to you... about me? I hope you'll excuse me, but I wish that you'd never met me, er... I mean, Sadie, at least not until after the novel is finished. There's an idea. Get your notebook ready. Now you're talking. I want you to phone and get some theater tickets for me. - And make a table reservation at, um... - Now look, Mr. Matthews. If you have any intention of devoting any time and thought to Sadie, you'd better get it out of your head right now. - Why? - Well, uh... she left town this morning. - She'll be gone for about two weeks. - She wouldn't do that. - Well, she did. - Where did she go? - She went to, er... Monterey. - To Monterey? Oh, no, I don't believe it. Why, she didn't say anything to me about it. She... Miss Belldon seems to be present, sir. I don't want to see her! I don't want to see her! Listen, will you keep her busy while I dress? I don't want to see her. Alright. Well, where is he? Mr. Matthews is, uh... dressing. Humph! Does he have to put on a dinner coat to dictate? Well, he didn't want to recieve you in a... in a dressing robe. If he isn't careful, he'll be recieving me in a straightjacket. - How's the novel coming? - Well, to be frank, Miss Belldon, it was progressing quite nicely until last night. Come on, tell me, women or liquor? Oh, I'm sure it wasn't drinking. Do you see that? It's a wire from the Superfine Film Corporation... ...reminding me that they've got to have the finished novel by the first. Today is the 28th! That's what I've been trying to tell him. If he doesn't have it finished in two days, he'll face the sweetest lawsuit he ever saw in his life and so will I. Now bring him out here! Yes, Miss Belldon, yes... Alonzo! - Yes, Miss? - Will you tell Mr. Matthews... ...that Miss Belldon insists upon seeing him. I'm afraid that would be rather impossible. Why, where is he? I should say by now he is precisely approaching south San Francisco. You dumb nitwit! What is he doing in south San Francisco? Mr. Matthews is on his way to Monterey. Monterey! With a person who seems to be known as, uh... Sadie. - Who on earth is Sadie? - It's me, um... I mean, my roommate. He went out with her last night. And in order to get his mind off her, I told him that she went to Monterey for two weeks. Two weeks? He's only got two days to finish the book. - I'll try to phone him. - You'll do nothing of the sort. You grab a bag and go right down there! Don't you lie to me! It seems very strange that every time I call Mr. Matthews is out. I never prevaricate, Miss Camille. Only this time he is out. Mr. Matthews just left for Monterey. - Monterey, for how long? - I couldn't say, Miss. But he took along two suitcases, his golf clubs and tennis racket... ...and said to forward his mail to Monterey Tavern. Is that so? Well, I'll show him something! I assure you, Miss Camille, that Mr. Matthews has gone away to work. Yes... what's her name? Hello, Marie, pack my overnight bag right away. And call the garage and tell them to have my roadster ready immediately. That's right. Yes, I'm going away. Right now, to Monterey! If you're not on your way to Monterey in one hour, you're fired! Yes, Miss Belldon. Won't madame wait for luncheon to be poured? Bah! Will you please tell me what the heck all the excitement's about? I don't wanna be wasting none of my time on my Saturday afternoon off. Don't bother me! Marge has to catch the 1:30 train to Monterey... ...and we've barely got time to get her packed. - What's she going to Monterey for? - I just told you. Her boss is there and she has to follow him down. You mean to say that guy ran out on her? - I knew he was a skunk! - Oh, don't be a fool! Why didn't you tell me before? Do you think I'm gonna let that Matthews take advantage of our Marge? - What are you talking about? - Look! You and me are engaged, ain't we? And you and her are roommates, ain't you? Don't that practically make her my sister? Do you think I'm gonna stand by and see a member of my family disgraced? You better stand by and get out of my way or Marge is gonna miss her train. Have you got those things ready, Sadie? - Coming. - Listen, I have half a mind... Here, don't do that again. You have half a mind alright. Keep the change. Room and bath, please. I'm afraid we have only a few rather expensive ones left. - Price is no object. - Oh... certainly, madam. I can give you a very nice room with bath. - Number 321. - Thank you. Will you please tell the boy to take my bags up to my room. And will you look and see if Mr. Frederic Matthews is registered here. He is, madam. He's been to the desk several times today... ...inquiring after a certain young lady he's expecting. - Perhaps you are the... - No, I hardly think he's expecting me. - Fred... - Where is Mr. Matthews now? I believe he's in the rear, madam. He's checking some incoming baggage. - Out there? - Yes. Thank you. Let me ask you something, Mike. If you knew there was a beautiful girl around here some place... ...and you wanted to find her, where would you look first? Right in back of me to make sure my wife wasn't following me. Mr. Matthews! - What are you doing here? - I came down here to be with Sadie. Where is she, I've been looking all over for her. Well, she won't be here until at least 5 o'clock. She's driving. And in the meantime, don't you think this is a good chance to get some work done? Are you going to start that again? But, Mr. Matthews, your book is due tomorrow. If you'll can only spend a couple of hours, we can finish it... Nothing doing, I'm not going to do a lick of work until Sadie arrives. Mr. Matthews, won't you please listen to me for a moment? Alright, what is it? Marge, I mean, Sadie won't be here for several hours. I'll go and get my notebook and pencil right now. No, I've got a lot of things to do. I gotta get a shave... ...and a haircut, otherwise I won't look decent for tonight. - Tonight? - They're having a big fiesta tonight. Then that's all the more reason why you should work right now. Okay, you win. Go get your notebook. I'll dictate to you while they work on me. Alright. Chapter 31. Sylvia, alone in the room of her boarding house, stood gazing out the window... ...at the bleak winter day. You like her gazing out the window with a bleak winter day, don't you? Certainly not. Well, stood gazing out the window... at a sunny July afternoon. How's that? Warmer. Excuse me. Hello? Yes, this is Mr. Matthews speaking. Yes, er... Camille? In the lobby? No, no, no, no! You stay there, I'll come down. - That'll be all for... - Mr. Matthews, please! No, that's all. Miss Lansing is downstairs. - But when are we going to finish this? - A year from Wednesday, goodbye, please. Well, well, well. This is a surprise. I can imagine! Yes... Darling, it's a long story, I... It's very silly of you to say that you're going to punch the clerk in the nose... ...and burn the hotel down just because I happen to choose this place to do some work. That's beside the point. Who are you down here with? Well, there are 150 women in the hotel. You don't think I'm making love to all of them, do you? - I wouldn't put it past you. - I give up. And if it wasn't for the fiesta tonight, I'd scratch your eyes out. Are you g... The, er... are you going to the fiesta? I most certainly am, and you're going to take me. You know, they tell me that it's an awful bore. People rent costumes and go there and... it's, um... I can promise you you won't have a good time. Have you got a single room with a bath? Oh, yes indeed. Oh, yes, Miss Day, we've been expecting you. Mr. Matthews, one of the guests, has been looking all over for you. - Really? - Shall I have him paged? Mr. Matthews is over in the corner of the lobby, sir. - Shall I get him? - Yes, will you please? You see, this book means a great deal to me and I've got to get at it. - Mr. Matthews. - Yes. That party you've been expecting is at the desk. Oh, is sh... is it...? Uh... when did they arrive? - Just this moment, sir. - Oh. Uh... a friend of mine arrived for the fiesta. A friend of the family's, as a matter of fact. Man or woman? Well, it's a... lady. Most embarrassing, I uh... I promised to take them to the... - To the fiesta. - Yes. I understand. I'll meet you both here in the lobby at 8:30. Both... um, 8:30. - Sadie, I thought you'd never get here. - Freddy, how did you know I was coming? Marge told me. Oh, darling, I don't think we can talk here. Yes, I know the spot. Did I ever tell you about your eyes? They're blue. They always have been. And if you don't finish your book on time, Marge will be held responsible. She'll lose her job. Yeah, kind of a Mediterranean blue. She's my best friend. And I can't sit by and see anything like that happen to her. Mediterranean blue with a reflexion of a June sky in them. Will you stop it and listen to what I'm trying to tell you about Marge? I don't think you appreciate her. And what do you want me to do, marry the girl? - Well, you could do worse. - I know how I can do a lot better. - Do you? - They're having a big fiesta here tonight. Let's turn it into a celebration. - Of what? - Of our engagement. - Oh, Freddy, I... - Now that's settled. But you won't have time to go to the fiesta. - Why not? - Well, you'll be working on your book. - Oh, hang the book. - We can't let Marge down like that. Alright, if it means so much to you, I'll make a bargain with you. You go out and get yourself a costume for the fiesta... ...and I'll go upstairs and dictate to Marge. Oh no, you can't, you see... Marge, well... She went out... for just a few hours, to get a little fresh air. - Maybe I can get her for you. - No, no, don't you bother. I'll go upstairs and write the outline of the last two chapters of this book myself. - Are you serious? - I certainly am. And if you'll promise me that you'll meet me in the patio tonight at, um... Eight-thirty. It's a bargain. A table for the ladies? Thank you, Mr. Matthews is expecting me to join him. Mr. Matthews is expecting me! Mr. Matthews? Certainly, ladies, right this way. It's, uh... very pleasant. Do you mind introducing me to your friend, Freddy? Oh, I beg your pardon. Miss Lansing, Miss Day. Yes, um... I guess I'm a pretty lucky fellow having... ...the two most beautiful girls in the room at my table. Oh, don't be ridiculous, Freddy. He's only partly ridiculous, Miss Lansing. I don't believe I know what you mean, Miss... Only that you are really lovely. I've always admired you... ...from a distance. Really? I don't remember ever having seen you before, dear. Oh, I'm sure we must have bumped into each other some time, dear. Here is the outline for the rest of the story. - Oh, how nice! - Let me look, Freddy! - I didn't think you could do it. - I beg your pardon. Oh, not at all. I think you'd better take it and give it to Marge. - Her friend is my secretary. - How interesting. Where is she tonight, by the way? Don't you think I ought to ask her to join us? Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. Marge went to bed. Tired with the exertion of trying to get you to go to work. Isn't it marvelous how many women take an interest in Freddy's work? But Freddy, when are you going to develop the outline? Looks to me as though you have a lot of ground to cover. Well, later tonight, or first thing in the morning. However, let's forget about the book tonight. Give me the fanfare. I want to make an announcement for the manager. Certainly. Toque de atenci?n. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I want to make an announcement here for the management. If you'll all just move in closer so you can hear me. That's right, get right down here. Now, there's nothing to get excited about... ...and if you behave yourselves, nobody's gonna get hurt. This is a stickup. Get up! Hurry up, come on, get up! Come on, get up! You too, haven't got all night, make it snappy! Go on, get down there! Hurry up, come on, get going. Make it fast. Come on! - Get the police! There's a robbery... - Put down that phone! Hands up! Get going. Come on, boys, start moving! - Where is she, where did she go? - How do I know? Did you see a blond lady in a Spanish costume? Yes, sir, she just got into a car with those crooks. - Are you positive? - I'm positive. They all run right by me. She must have been kidnapped. When was Miss Day last seen? She was with those bandits when they ran off here. She disappeared when the lights went out. There's been a lot of crimes around the beaches lately. - We'll go up and search her room. - We've already searched 223, Mr. Cuddleton. - Her baggage is still there. - Where is the police station? Right down in the town. Tim, get the chief out of bed. Tell him he'd better come over here right away. Get out a radio call right away. Advise all cars to be on the lookout for a missing woman in a car with four men. Name, Sadie Day. Calling all cars. A woman, blond, blue eyes, height five-feet five, identified as Sadie Day is missing. Possible kidnapping. What do you want... - What's the matter? - Baby! Tell me you're safe and I ain't dreaming! What's the matter with you, have you gone cuckoo? All the way over here all I could think of... ...was about time I put the gum drops in your hiking boots. Gum drops? Now, Jake, what is this all about? You're supposed to be missing. Look, the papers are full of it. What are you talking about? Sadie Day, San Francisco beauty disappears... The mere fact that it says beauty ought to have told you it wasn't me, you dumb cluck. Somebody must have incognitoed under your name. Incognitoed... Jake, do you know who this is? - Who? - It's Marge! I've been trying to tell you for the past two weeks. She's been posing under my name to her boss. That's why she followed him to Monterey. Followed nothing. She was lured! Who can that be? I'm Miss Belldon. Now just what is this all about and where is Miss Winton? Er, kidnapped, so we hear. Well, I'm going to get to the bottom of this. Mabel, you call a cab right away. I don't think I could find a cab in this neighborhood. Why worry about a cab at a time like this? My car's standing right downstairs in the gutter. - Where are we going? - To Monterey! Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! - Come on, let's hurry! - Wait a minute! - Get dressed! - Oh, I forgot. I'll be down in a minute. Is this your car? It ain't no trailer, lady. - What did we stop for? - We seem to be here. Try to get out, Abbie. Where's that plumber? I want him to straighten out my elbow. Here, you can't leave that thing here. Well, you know where to put it, I don't. - Is Marge with you? - Yes. Well, I talked to her over the telephone about an hour ago... ...she's upstairs in her room, I think. You... Well then what's all this talk about her disappearing? No, no, it was Sadie who disappeared. - Hey, you ain't disappeared, have you? - Oh, shut up, uh... Of course, I meant Sadie. That is, um... Where is she? Uh, has Marge heard from her? What happened to her? I've been looking for her all night, the police have been notified, there have been radio broadcasts, the, uh... Freddy Matthews! Abbie. Freddy Matthews, what about that book? Book? What chance do you think I've had to think about a book? Do you realize what a terrible thing has happened? The girl has been kidnapped. I realize we are both going to face a $30,000 lawsuit. - I don't care. - What's that girl got to do with you? I happen to be in love with her, that's all. Why, there's Marge now! Oh, Marge darling! We were so afraid you were kidnapped. Nonsense. Who'd try to kidnap a homely girl like me? I've been working all night on this story and it's finished. - You finished the book? - Yes. Thank goodness it's all here! Ah, the little working girl. I suppose now that the blond has disappeared, she's rushed in to fill the vacancy in the ranks. Now, Camille, I... You might as well get this straight, Miss Lansing. My only interest in Mr. Matthews was in getting him to finish his book. I promised Miss Belldon that I'd see him through. And I did, in spite of everything you tried to do to prevent it. And now that the book is finished, you can have him! - I don't want him. - May I have a vote? As soon as my bag is in the car, I'm leaving. Oh, are you? Yes, certainly. You showed very plainly what you think of me. You've acted like a crazy man ever since that girl disappeared. Well, I'm in love with her, you may as well know about it. Well, then I guess we'd better say goodbye, hadn't we? - Yes, I suppose so. - Goodbye. Goodbye! She seems to be disturbed about something. Yes, I, uh... - Marge, you've just about saved my life. - Oh, that's all right, Miss Belldon. Just a minute. I don't quite understand how you did this. Why, I simply followed your outline. It was very complete. - Yes, but Sadie had the outline. - Yes... She, uh... she gave it to me. Then you've seen her. Where is she, is she safe? I know where she is and she's perfectly safe. - And I'm going home. - Wait a minute. You've got to take me to Sadie immediately. Oh no, I don't. I finished the book and I'm through. I'm sick of the whole business. Wait just a moment, either you take me to Sadie at once... - ...or this goes in the fireplace. - Freddy! Mr. Matthews, please, don't! - Freddy, you're insane! - Mr. Matthews, You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you? He'll do it, Marge, he'll do anything once he gets a fool idea in his head. After all my work? Freddy, that's hardly the sporting thing to do. Now will you take me to Sadie? Marge, please, where is this woman? Take him to her. - Immediately! - For his sake, for my sake, for everybody's sake. Alright, just hold everything. I'll be right back. Wait a minute. I'm going to go upstairs and pack. I have an idea it won't be long before all of us go back to San Francisco. - Miss Winton. - Yes? This is Mr. Matthews, I've got to see you for a minute. Oh, uh... Oh, just a minute. Oh... Mr. Matthews, have you gone crazy? On the contrary, the light is just beginning to dawn. You shouldn't come in here like this. - Have you forgotten about Sadie? - I don't care about Sadie, she doesn't mean a thing to me. I know what's the matter with me, I've been dazzled by Sadie's beauty, dazzled, and I've just come to in time. It isn't Sadie I love, it's you. - Me? - Yes, you, the kind of a girl... ...who doesn't get herself kidnapped. The kind of a girl who finishes my book for me. The kind of a girl I can trust out of my sight. Oh, thank you. Marriage is one thing, infatuation is another. I don't think she would have made a very good wife anyway. - Is that so? - I never want to see her again... ...as long as I live. Well, I must say, you're not very reliable. - Let's forget about Sadie. - Oh, please, my glasses... Here, you don't need your glasses, take them off. - Freddie, my glasses... - And while you're at it, - ...you don't need that either. - Freddie, you fool! - What is this? - Well, really. - Where's Marge? - Marge is gone forever. This is Sadie. Now, wait a minute, let's get this straight. - Who are you? - Sadie. - Who is Sadie? - Marge. - Why? - Oh, I get it. She's Sadie that's really Marge. Just like I'm Mabel when I'm not Mike. Well, who am I? - You're Jake. - Now we're getting somewhere. If she ain't Marge anymore, and she's Sadie, who have I been keeping company with? - Me. - Who are you? - Suzie. - Then I never met you before? That's right. - Alright now... - I wish you'd get your names straight. So do I. I've got to tell it to a marriage license clerk in about three minutes. Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
