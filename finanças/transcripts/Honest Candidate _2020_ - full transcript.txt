HONEST CANDIDATE She has been the compass of my life. My grandmother. She said to me when my parents passed away in my youth, “Help those less fortunate, and live honestly.” She made a huge fortune when her small plot of land was bought up for development, but she donated everything for society and went to work in the market with her ailing body. At the time, I was fighting alone against a massive insurance company. Due to a fine print in the contract, grandma’s cancer wasn’t covered by the insurance. Upon winning the unwinnable fight against all expectations, I went to the congress with my grandmother's support. She may have passed away, but I will continue to carry her torch and fight to create a better world. An honest politician who keeps her promise. Candidate number one, Joo-- JOO SANG-SUK Lower it. Rewind it a bit. Over there. Can you emphasize that cross more? Where's the cross? We’ve been losing Christian votes lately. That’s because you attended a Buddhist ceremony recently. -Exactly. -We should’ve tightened the schedule then. So that you could leave as soon as possible. Sorry about that. Also, isn’t that shot of kissing my husband a bit weird? Weird. Not weird. It’s beautiful. Married couples don’t kiss, especially when they're sober. Your image is leaning towards the masculine side lately, so... Remove it. Okay, we’ll remove it. Remove the kiss. -Shall we call it a day? -Yes, sir. -Great work, everyone. -Thank you. Let’s do this. -Candidate number one. -Hooray. Okay. I'll get going. -Mr. Park. -Yes? Let's keep it together. I must maintain my dignity as a fourth term incumbent. Of course. -No scratches, please. -Sorry about that. Careful, ma’am. -Are you okay? -Yeah, let’s go. Ms. Joo, one moment. What was that for? It didn’t look worn out enough. This side too. Okay. Ms. Joo is heading out. Hello there. I’m candidate number one Joo Sang-suk. Candidate number one, Joo Sang-suk. Hello, I’m candidate number one, Joo Sang-suk. Hello madame. What do we get if we pick you? I’ll do anything you ask. Should I swap your hubby first? Hello, I’m Joo Sang-suk. I’m Joo Sang-suk and my baptismal name is Maria. Behind you. May you attain nirvana. CHURCH It’s been so long, deaconess. Gosh. I know, presbyter. Have you been well? CANDIDATE NUMBER 1 JOO SANG-SUK HONEST CANDIDATE You’re up against Candidate Nam, whom you defeated by 12 votes 8 years ago. Please make a comment on this please. This is a Catch-22 question. I should hold it in. Every word leads to votes. We’re debating over Hyuntan City’s transformation into a city of science. Candidates Shin and Candidate Nam will get to question Candidate Joo. You have a two-minute limit. I have another question. Who will maintain the facility after the exposition? With whose money? Don’t you think you’re ignoring the opinions of the taxpayers who are worried that their hard-earned money might be wasted? Not at all, I’m listening very carefully. Since you're my biggest detractor, I’ll convince you by the end of today. When I was a mayor, I approved the takeover of Hyuntan University. Thank you for that. You helped revitalize it with your Ok-hui Foundation. Won’t you comment on its shady financial dealings? They say it’s used for money laundering. Do you have any legal grounds for that accusation? -I’m giving you a chance-- -The word on the street is that you made hundreds of thousands on stocks. -Camera three, cut in. -That's a groundless rumor... Close-up on Nam’s annoyed face. When will you respond to your son’s dual citizenship issue? Candidate Nam, please stay on the topic. I still have time. Please wait. Could you respond? No, drag it out. There’s nothing I’m ashamed of. My entire fortune is a 700 square feet apartment. Ma’am, I’m talking about your son right now. The science department created in my grandmother’s name has taken in so many students from very difficult backgrounds... Gosh. -Why... -Candidate Joo, should we take a break? Sorry, I became too emotional. So many students have built their dreams with Ok-hui scholarships. How dare you use their dreams for your own political gain? -Me? -I’m extremely disappointed in you. -That’s not what I mean-- -About the science city-- Candidates, your time has run out. -You okay? -The next topic of this first debate is regional economic revitalization. Great work today. No one here works harder than you. It was a great debate. Let’s work together for a long time. A long, long time. Why isn’t anyone digging into Ok-hui Foundation accusations? It's been six years. Easy, she’ll get elected only if she doesn’t commit murder. Let it go. Sorry, I’m late. Welcome. Come in. Sit. It was a fun debate, Candidate Nam. For you, maybe. Stressed husband, scolding wife. What a chemistry. I’m the one doing tricks, but she gets all the votes. Come on now. After she wins her fourth term, we’ll then go with whatever you’re planning. -No, I-- -However, stop biting into the foundation. You could get hurt. I’m fond of that foundation. I only did that because she asked about my stocks. You’re the stock market expert. Did I hurt your feelings? I’ll give you a gift. It's a good scoop. Buy Wy Logitech. Get a loan if you have to. Not ‘Y’, it’s ‘Wy’. It’s not ‘Why’ either. I know. 'Wy'. Right, Wy. I just bought you a house each. Okay. We still have to have a fair fight like this. So I can help you down the line. All right, we’re now all in this together. Cheers. Buy me a building next time. Gosh, you're so greedy. What’s the point, love passes by Like a shot arrow Those memories were dazzling And filled with sorrow -Age is just a number -Age is just a number -But the heart is real -But the heart is real Go with your heart By the way, how could you sing your own campaign song? Say good bye to sorrow You live only once -Love is a necessity -Necessity -Marriage is a choice -Choice Just follow your heart Tears are bubbles of breaking up Don’t be afraid of new love Let's go! Amor fati He won’t let me have lunch to hand out business cards. Gwangjin district candidate is giving out Hot 6 energy drinks. I developed a tolerance for Hot 6, it doesn’t work for me. Hot 6 won't do. You need something stronger. The old fart runs marathons every weekend. My knees are all busted. That’s it? My wife left me. -Really? -I haven't been home for over a month. My wife went to her parent's house. Excuse me. Wait. Hold on. Just a moment! Wait! Just a moment! Dang it, it’s in selfie mode. It was 45N 8217, 45N 8217. Hold on, hold on. Please. I’ll pretend I didn’t see you, so just be honest with me. -Did he shoot with hidden cams? -No. Eight, two one... Wait! Do any footages show faces? It's 45N 8217, right? Do any footages contain Assemblywoman Joo's face? Mr. Park, what's going on? What's happening? Please forgive me. What company does he work for? -He doesn’t know. -Come on. But I got the plate number. It was 45N 8217. If this blows up, are we all going down? Mr. Kim, could you take care of this? Hyuntan candidate number one Joo Sang-suk Trusted candidate number one, Joo Sang-suk Loyal candidate Always thinking of Hyuntan City Have faith in candidate number one Joo Sang-suk Candidate number one Joo Sang-suk ANY ARTICLES? NOTHING, DON'T WORRY. I'M SCARED SHITLESS. DANCE. Where were you looking? Look what you did. Gosh. That looks bad. I’ll have to get you a new car. How about a German car? A BMW? What? Give me the footage you shot yesterday along with this car. Who are you? I had to run for congress. Do you all remember? When I was representing Hyuntan in the congress and as a mayor... Candidate number three Shin Ji-seon. People’s Future Party, candidate number three Shin Ji-seon. Hello there. -Welcome, Mr. Kim. -I'm here. -Kim Sang-pyo. -This way, please. -Kim Sang-pyo. -Kim Sang-pyo. Great work everyone. I traded the hidden camera for the BMW. -Kim Sang-pyo. -Kim Sang-pyo. Ms. Yoon, thank you so much. I’ll treat you to some alcohol later. Call me. Candidate Joo Sang-suk. I care deeply for her. Vote for her once more. -Kim Sang-pyo. -Kim Sang-pyo. Knee. Hello, sir. How’s your knee? You remembered that? I wish I could buy you some meds, but it’s against the election law. It’s all right. Kindergarten waitlist. So adorable. How's your kindergarten problem... Not her. Are you still on the waitlist? Yes. When you get elected, please take care of this. Trust me and have a second child. She is my second child. Good evening. Honey. -Hello. -Honey. It’s a great night, how about a round? Sure, I will get my snickers. Oh my, I forgot to get your shoes. You fool. Everyone, always be healthy. I’m always like this. -Good night. -Yes, ma’am. Have a good night. Can I stop doing this? I don’t even play badminton, this is so annoying. So many votes come from the badminton club. Every single damn day... Only I can do this. Sang-suk. Do you not have a nose? Yeah, Mom. What? Sang-suk? -Why? -Have you gone mad? Take it. Yes, Mother. I’m sorry for not picking up the phone earlier. I was too busy to pick up. The passcode? When I fired the housekeeper, I changed... I should’ve told you earlier. What? Soy sauce beef? We’ll eat it right away. I love you. Holy crap. I got solicited so many times, it was hard rejecting them. You poor thing. But we’ll have to do something for my friend. His daughter is having a flight attendant test. But she can’t speak English. I told him we’ll help. Let's help her. We’re capable of that, right? Okay. And that golf instructor, he’s sick of the utility pole in front of his house. When he opens the windows, the utility pole is right there... -We’ll pull it out for him. -Just pull it out. Remember Yong-man? My college senior? Just write me a list. I've already written it down. He wants to set up a gym in the Blue House, -and he wants our help. -This girl... She works well, so give her a 500,000 won raise. A 500,000 won raise? If you got money, give it to me. Or get someone who can speak Korean. It drives me nuts. Forget it, we can raise it later. And this is from my grandma’s younger sibling. Is there a plan for a Hoengseong subway station? What was that? Candidate number one Joo Sang-suk. My gosh. I’m here. Are you sick? Are you so giddy to lie that I’m dead? Don’t lie that you’re sick and fetch me, I’m busy. That’s why I called you at night. To avoid traffic. Where are you going? You’re an accomplice. I was going to shut the door. Asshole, this isn’t Burger King. You said to come quickly. I’m done hiding out. -That again? -Why? They’re building a ski resort here. I need to move out. I will find another secluded spot. Somewhere warm with a good view. You rotting pieces of shit. Grandma, please. You’re the one who ran off a day before the election with a note. You said you would ‘return to nature’, so we all thought you went off to die. You should’ve corrected everyone. You maintained the lie for sympathy votes. I should’ve come out then. Fine. Let’s come out and confess. And I'll get arrested for spreading false information. That’s seven years of imprisonment, ten years of license suspension, and a fifty million won penalty. Do we have to keep lying until we die? I saw a bit of kindness in you when you were young, but not now. There is, there really is, but you can’t see it since your eyes are bad. I checked up on you, so I’ll leave now. You’re not in contact with your old friends, right? That’s what you worry about? -Sang-suk. -Yeah? You came so far. Take this and eat. What is it? Grandma. Joo Sang-suk, candidate number one. Take this and suck on it. Gosh! Why did you even call me? Are you okay? My shoe. It’s ruined. Are you okay? Ms. Joo, hop on. I’ll just walk. Let me just put away my phone. Ms. Joo... I didn’t get much exercise. -Ms. Joo. -Forget it. No, no, there. Stay here for a bit. I’ll head down and bring back an umbrella and shoes. Put this on. I’ll be right back. Get me elected for the fourth time. I didn’t donate my whole fortune to get anything in return, but you know that, right? And I want to become a famous politician... Forget about my ticket to heaven. Use all my deeds on Sang-suk. ...known to people all over the country. Make her grow up and be kind. Please make her stop lying. Please. What is this? Hui-cheol! Mom just called. She wants us to visit her for a meal. That hag. Huh? Yeah? What did you just say? Did you just call my mom a hag? Sorry, I get irritated whenever your family is mentioned. I hate that hag. What? What’s with me? Still, don’t talk about her first thing in the morning. Hey. Don’t you "hey" me. I’m older than you. Are you nuts? You always wanted to sound younger than I am. Gosh... What’s wrong with me? Sir, could I reposition the camera a little bit? Sure. The camera's at the perfect angle to make her double chin a meme online. It goes up quite high. Could you make the lights a bit brighter? This lighting will accentuate her crow's feet. -Sure. -I brought drinks for all. Purple is our party color. Right here. Great work everyone. Is this it? -Good morning. -Hello there. I’m a big fan, Mr. Jang. Ms. Joo had always wanted to be a guest on Forest of News. Really? I thought she didn't do current affairs? Right. I got a peek at the script. You don’t go off script, right? Well, that depends on how the interview goes. Right. This part here, I think we should remove it. -I understand. -Okay. And you don’t do R-rated jokes and such, right? -We don't have time for that. -Yes, I know. And could I trouble you not to bring up the mayoral and presidential elections? You're being quite excessive. Please have a good interview. -Hello. -Hello. You must be a little nervous since we're live on the air. Yes. I guess it will feel similar if I was on TV for a presidential election. You've mentioned the presidential election from the very start of the interview. That was quite an honest answer. Since it’s on the table, may I ask some hard questions? Like how many times we do it a week? How many times do we do it? Do what, Candidate Joo? What’s with her? I think you’re the first candidate to make R-rated jokes here. Only adults can vote, after all. As you see, she can be quite feisty at times. What's the use when we've been platonic for years? Our home is the friend zone national headquarters. And I'm the director there! Candidate Joo, have some cold water. -Yes. -Okay. Am I hearing things? Lots of comments are being posted in real-time. “Is Assemblywoamn Joo drunk or high?” “Is this a hidden camera prank?” and so forth. Do you usually read the comments made about you online? Not at all. I don’t read a word of anything ever since I won my third term. I even have my aides read the menu for me. Come on now. Cut to the music. We will return after some music. This is Jang Deok-jun’s Forest of News. What did she just say? Is this a strategy? So, are you planning to run for president? Yes, I should be a president at least once. What is this? Is she on Saturday Night Live? You said you’ll make it happen. You told me it's possible because it's me. Did I say that? I don’t think I can go home today. CANDIDATE NUMBER 1 JOO SANG-SUK I’m absolutely certain. I can’t talk the way I want to. Words usually come from the brain, but it feels like they're coming out of my ass. It’s not like your words are shit. No, they totally are. I can’t control my sphincter. Stop being so vulgar. And put your shoes on. We are in an enclosed space. Do you not have a nose? Why are you ignoring it? I have rhinitis, so it’s fine. Says the guy who farts in bed all the time. Do I not have a nose? Is your gut rotting? What’s with you? I’m sorry. I can’t lie for some reason. It's probably because she's been under a lot of stress lately. -And for you, sir-- -He’s unemployed. Don’t call him that. What? Unemployed? You have to attend a kimchi-making event. Isn’t that for wives of the candidates? What do you take me for? Useless unemployed good-for-nothing! What? Is that how you see me? -Yes. -What? Don’t cry. I’m not. I’m not crying. You are, you cry baby. You’re old enough. Stop whining. Ma’am, you should save your words until you calm down. I’m getting out of here. -Honey. -Let go. You should still go make some kimchi while I ask nicely. Sir! Don't call me that! I’m unemployed! I caused an uproar online, haven't I? Yes, you’ve made the top trending topic. It was so frigging goddamn hard getting on that list before. Ma’am, please filter your words. Remember the fourth term dignity? Filter. Assemblywoman Joo! Go away, you freak. Get away from me, I’m sorry. We will see you again soon. Thank you for coming. Ma’am, you made some strong comments earlier. Would you like to follow-up? We will send out a separate press release. For the presidential election... Candidate Joo’s autobiography is on the store’s main stage. My Grandmother’s Dream. Here. Hello, Ms. Joo. I had a great time reading it. Could I get an autograph? You did? Even I haven’t read it yet. Ms. Joo, please autograph the inside page. -Name? -Pardon? Your name. Oh, it’s Lee Ae-rin. "Honesty and sweat will never betray you". That line really touched me. Yes, honesty and sweat indeed doesn't betray you. Never ever. Thank you for coming. Is that good? We’ll see you over there. My head’s itchy. AE-RIN, WILL HONESTY AND SWEAT REALLY NEVER BETRAY YOU? JOO SANG-SUK It’s over here. I came to support a mega bookstore opening in our district. I should probably say that it'll be a wave of fresh air in the publishing world. But when people get smarter, that’s bad news for us politicians. Sorry, that was so funny. That was a joke. Your autobiography is ranked first place on the politics bestseller list. Why do you think it’s a hit with the public? We hired part-timers to buy everything up. Ms. Joo, stop joking. It’s too much. Gosh. I'm sorry. It's just too funny... Ms. Kim. Next question, please? Yes. I’m sure you were very busy. How long did it take you to write the book? KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT NO TALKING Skip the question. That’s... GET IT TOGETHER THIS IS A WAR ZONE. STOP IT I didn’t write it. My ghostwriter wrote it. PLEASE Ten million won for three months. SHOCKING REVELATION BY HYUNTAN CANDIDATE JOO Honey, it’s done. It’s all over. We’ll have to go back to our hometown. What’s wrong with you? Why can’t you do it? Entertaining fluff. This mouth isn’t mine. Then whose mouth is it? Say “I’m actually a man.” I wish I was a man. I would get less shit then. I’m a servant for the people. People are my servants. Thirst-quencher for the people, a servant for the people, Joo Sang-suk! You know I’m not a people’s servant. You have really become brazen. Sang-suk. Is it true that you’ll buy me a car after the election? A used car. Why did she suddenly change her character? I know, Nam Yong-seong is the crass one. She was closely with the commissioner of the financial committee back then, and that’s when she became rich. It’s still only the cost of a house. More than meets the eye. -Where you going? -I miss her so much. Are you going to dig into her? Wouldn’t it be fun? Give Unanswered Questions a scoop. My friend’s a producer there. No, it’s mine. She’s using utilities. So she really lives here? It’s been a long day. I know. I canceled all upcoming events. That’s good. Not campaigning will be more beneficial to win. What should I tell Mr. Kim? I don’t know. Make something up. When shit hits the fan, I’ll assign it to my underlings, and I’ll just go off somewhere, get drunk, sleep and wait until you clean it all up. Maybe I should kill myself. That’s what I’m thinking right now. CANDIDATE NUMBER 1 JOO SANG-SUK Not coming? Coming. She took off the wig, and it became the top trending search word. "Ten million won for three months." Please don’t say anything. Ms. Joo, your hair looks great. Right? Honey, how about a game? We always play-- -She doesn’t want to play. -I see. Sir. Her bag. Please play, I mean, get some rest. I got you. They’re all shaky. Dammit. The dashcam... RECORDED FILES The first one. Pass, pass. What is this? You think I’m a joke? Like I’m worth less than dog shit. Embarrassing me in front of the neighbors. Wash your hands before bitching. You smell nasty. It's because I’ve been making kimchi all day. I can’t get the hot pepper smell out of my hands. Stop your moaning. You do one thing for the campaign and you keep moaning. So this is the new you? Hey mom. Welcome. Your fridge’s empty. Why didn’t you call ahead? Can I not drop in? An intruder... What... Did I hear that right? -No, you heard me-- -Oh, she meant strudel. I had a craving for a strudel. I came to drop off some side dishes. You were all over the news. I was a bit worried. You should worry on your own. What? Wait, Mom. She’s really sick right now. Do you not have any respect for your mother-in-law anymore? You’re still my daughter-in-law. -What are you doing? -Mom. Wait. Please. Don’t you walk away from me when I'm talking to you. Goddamn hag. No way, is she pregnant-- Hag-in-law. -Hag-in-law. -You’re pregnant? You have to impregnate me to get pregnant. Your semen isn’t micro dust, I can’t get pregnant over the air. I’ve had it. Come sit down. We need to talk. Wait. -Let’s talk. -Hold on, Mom. You will regret it. Spill your guts if you got something to say. I’m not a stubborn person. Let’s have a frank conversation. A frank conversation? I should just go die. Even so, don’t you think that was too much? Should I just sever ties with her? Don’t say anything. What did you say? Did you badmouth her again? No. I said she won’t come around for a while. I’m so happy. So happy. I’m so happy. So, so happy. You’re nuts. You’ve gone insane. -Candidate number one Joo Sang-suk. -Candidate number one, please vote. -Please drink this. -Thank you. Your approval ratings dropped by seven points. I know, you old fart. What? Mr... Fart... Mr. Kim? Old Mr. Fart! Whatever, you old fart. To have this kind of constant pattern is to have a logical mechanism. NEUROPSYCHIATRY DOCTOR JEON GI-PPEUM It could be caused by something non-medical-- So what does she have to do? I’ll prescribe some meds, so take the meds and get plenty of rest. Eat properly and don’t get stressed, right? -Yes. -Seriously? Say you can’t fix it and save me the time. Honey. You're the one who should be hospitalized. Your hat. Thank you. So annoying. Speak faster. Two, two. One. Nurse Kim, get cupping ready, and bring the extra-large needles. -Something much bigger. -Nurse Kim, please hurry. Bring them over quickly. Don’t move. -I'll make sure it won't hurt. -Use acupuncture to paralyze her. My poor Sang-suk. Who... You got a tongue paralysis. Mom? How could you not recognize me? Dad? Dad. Dad. My baby. It’s me, your grandma Ok-hui who's in heaven. I raised you so preciously. -Grandma? -Yes. Let’s go. Where are you going? -Should we look for another shaman? -Send your payment please. I told you to get the payment first, dammit. That shaman said I could become the president. Can we get through this storm? Bring in a captain who can steer us through this. When everyone shunned Mr. Han during his presidential run, he stayed by him until the end. A loyal kingmaker. He’s a Harvard graduate and a strategist, who focuses on election campaigns. He's too good to just fade away. He’s waiting. Could we hurry a little? I’m not sorry for being late. I’ll be absolutely direct. I can’t lie at all. That’s a good girl. If you can help me get through this election, consider your retirement fully secured. I have enough money to last until I die. -Bull. -What? Ball. Cheese balls? Are you hungry? -Bring her some snacks. -Right, cheese balls. I’ll go to the store and... But why does my comeback have to be through your mess? We brought some puer tea from China. Please have some. Oh no. It must be hot. -I’m sorry. -It’s not hot. It cooled off. Why does it have to be you? I’m the only one who asked for your service. Right? That’s what you said. Attention. Our consultant, Mr. Lee Un-hak is here. CANDIDATE NUMBER 1 JOO SANG-SUK Campaign strategies, press kits, pledge and support base analysis, just the essentials. Smells good. I love the scent of election more than anything. We would like to minimize her appearances. That’s not good. An election is a show. Its star must be seen. How’s Candidate Nam doing? He’s catching up, but he won’t play dirty. We have an agreement. He probably went with the alternative since he knows he can’t win dirty. If there’s a possibility for him to win, he’ll do anything. Start the vacuum. We need to suck up every vote we can get. Korea is one blood. It means we all know each other. LEE CHUN-GEOL Have you been well, Chairman? It’s been so long. Look who it is. Are you back in politics? It seems so. Who are you backing this time? Joo Sang-suk of Hyuntan, sir. Our clansmen support Joo Sang-suk. Hooray, Joo Sang-suk. FC HYUNTAN MORNING SOCCER CLUB -Candidate number one, salute. -Salute. We got the photo. 2. USE THE NEGATIVE When was this taken? Joo Sang-suk, you bitch. Hey. I told you not to take this road. Did Mrs. Ok-hui sacrifice her life for the campaign? Why did she die during the campaign period? I look really bad in this. And why does she look like a saint here? 3. CHANGE THE FRAME The related search terms have changed like this. From ‘Candidate Joo divorce’ to ‘Candidate Joo friendzone.’ He came here too? How diligent. Who will you choose? I don’t know, you? That funny lady who took off her wig. What was her name? CANDIDATE NUMBER 1 JOO SANG-SUK Remember my wig? This is my hair. -Please vote for me. -Thank you. Hello. Ten million won for three months. It's Joo Sang-suk. -Please vote for me. -Thank you. To help her son avoid military service, Candidate Joo gave birth to him abroad. Now, her son can’t be located even by the prosecutors and the cops. Nam Yong-seong, that bastard. He didn’t even go halves on the BMW. Did he screw us over? -Hello. -Hello. I told him not to drag Eun-ho into this, dammit. Mr. Bong, we need your help. I was told to hole up somewhere until my mom got elected. Since you’ll get photographed, it’s good to get a trim. Natural’s good, and so is wild. You got all that good looks thanks to me. Am I right? Say something. Gosh... You’re being too careful. It’ll be summer soon. Go breezy. Say what? Go breezy. Let’s shave it. -Shave it? -Shave it. -It’s nice. -Gosh. -Hey. -Damn. No. You need to go to the military. Clipper. The clipper. Hurry. Eun-ho. Wait, come on now. Why do I need to be drafted? I’m going to live as an American citizen. You’re not an American, you’re totally a Korean. My soul will be crushed if I get drafted. So leave your soul here. And take the body there. Don’t say ‘fuck’ to your dad. What in the world? What am I doing? I got you. Be a good son, just once. Hold still, your ear may get cut. Resent your mom. How amazing. You live such complicated lives. So be an amazing son. Other guys get exempted so easily. You can’t even do that for me? My son, you’ve really turned out to be such a jackass. Which do you prefer? The special force or the marine corps? I’ll make it happen. Gosh. If you send me off to the military, I’ll quit college. How can I make music when you've crushed my soul? I’ll end up useless like dad. Your mom’s going places because I support her. It's either the Korean military or the Berklee College of Music. I’ll give you 100 million won after military service. Yes, mother. There's 540 days in 18 months, so it’s 200,000 won per day. Think of it as a part-time job. Give me more. Hazard pay. I’ll be risking my life to protect this country. He knows how to negotiate. If he works for foreign affairs, he’ll get us more territory. Let’s say, 300 million won. -Deal. -Deal. Me too. I want 300 million won, too. It’s so hard being a caring husband. No, I want three billion won. His service is only two years, but I have to do this for life. Mother. Come to think of it, I think 500 million won would do-- Stop it. Forget it. I’ve had it. -Screw you both. -Wait, what are you doing? Did you think you could exploit me? I’ve had it. -Today is your funeral. Come here. -Oh, jeez. Stop. I should’ve died last time. Mom. Why did I bother bringing this? You got my hubby to cut my son’s hair. From now on, don’t make decisions without consulting me. It will be a voluntary enlistment. Just read what’s written there. PRESS CONFERENCE STATEMENT ON JOO SANG-SUK'S MATERNITY TRIP I can’t. Why not? Some of it isn't true. How could you not know that this would come back to haunt you? It’s just military service. You were dumb to avoid it. You live off taxpayer’s money. Why take a maternity trip? It wasn’t a maternity trip. I didn’t even give birth. Eun-ho’s birth mother gave birth to him in the States. Do you really have to do this? I made a big deal out of it, and I can’t refuse to have a press conference right now. What if I say I didn’t give birth to Eun-ho? He’ll get hurt. That’s what you’re worried about? I may not have... I may not have given birth to him, but he’s my child. What was that? Where you going? I’ll get some more ice. She’s a good woman. He’s going to kill me. I would like to respond to accusations of my son’s dual citizenship and... -Camera. The camera. -Ms. Joo, are you okay? Ms. Joo. Please call 911. Hold on. So it’s all settled with voluntary enlistment? Yes, ma’am. Candidate Joo’s son who is in the midst of a controversy isn’t her biological son? Right. His biological mother gave birth to him in USA, and Candidate Joo’s camp is yet to give an official statement. Lee Un-hak, that backstabbing bastard. Where is that bastard? People say weird things when they’re sick. Doctor. Please help. She needs help. There she is. Candidate Joo. She’s being discharged early for the election. She stated that she won’t use her family for her campaign. It’s a thoughtful statement, not as a politician but as a mother. People are praising her for raising her stepson as her own son. Ma’am, I’ll take you to your apartment. Skip it, my boy must be in shock. But there’s a protocol-- Just go. Yes, ma’am. Why are they splitting up? HBS PRESS Eun-ho. It’s still cold in April. Why are you in the pool? Are you in shock? I’m really sorry. I’m the sinner. Mom. I didn’t want you to find out like this. Son. Eun-ho, you know how much I love you, right? I knew you didn’t give birth to me. -What? -What? You knew? Why didn’t you say anything? You’re doing important work. I didn’t want you to worry. He’s so thoughtful. It’s okay. Why you little... Since when did you know? -When I was eight? -Eight? How? You told me when you were drunk. -Me? -Yeah. I did? “Your mom is someone else. She’s my first love. So beautiful, unlike someone.” You told me when you were drunk. Did I say anything else? Honey, are you okay? You’re fine, right? I was so worried. What is it, baby? My darling Sang-suk, I-- Go kill yourself. Honey. Baby. Baby, listen to me. You’re my everything. Help! Mom! Can you take care of my visa and find me a better job? What? You should do that at the very least. I’m sabotaging my job. You speak Korean so well. But you didn’t learn to speak respectfully? Everyone speaks so rudely, so I didn’t get to that. Let me apologize on everyone’s behalf. It’s fine, everyone’s older than me. The lady of the house... She said she’d give me a 500,000 won raise, but she didn't. That bitch. Bitch? Who built the Mangmi pedestrian overpass? Joo Sang-suk did. Who built the Black Hole Park in Sumi District? Joo Sang-suk? Thank you so much. I have a question. Is it true that Taewon Life subsidiary built the overpass and the park? It’s Candidate Shin. Where did you hear about such a juicy scoop... Didn’t you fight against them over insurance claim? I can’t say that’s not true. Cue. Cue. Since you’re here, sing a song for us. Right, a song. Why are you bursting into a song? Hyuntan candidate number one Joo Sang-suk Excuse me. Trusted candidate, Joo Sang-suk HYUNTAN HOUSEWIFE SINGING CLASS Did you partner up with Taewon? Gosh... You said our city’s economy and reputation will improve after the exposition. -That’s -The microphone... all bullshit. Then why did you push for it? Because Taewon bought a ton of Wy shares. There’s a bomb. What? Wy? I put most of my stuff here. -This is my last batch. -Why didn’t I eat this earlier? What a waste. Gosh. Why are you taking that back? This isn’t from Taewon. What about kimchi that they gifted? Isn’t it a gift of love? Reject the love. If it’s from Taewon, everything must go back. Where are the golf clubs? How could I return used goods? That’s not the problem here. Even an undie could lock you up. Not my undies... Is it washed? This house is rented to you by Taewon. I know. We’ll move out. Why are you lashing out at me? Like Mr. Lee said, return these and donate the rest. You were good at this back then. I had it washed. It’s a clean pair. You got any undies? If you got some, bring them out. I was going to flip out, but it’s good to see that I’ve gained points. Since it turned out this way, let’s go double on your honesty. What do you think people will expect from you now? Something stronger? Or something more potent? Or something more insane? A gentle image can't be used now, and trying to recover from it is pointless. Do what people want to see. CANDIDATE NUMBER 1 JOO SANG-SUK Attention, please. We’ll be adjusting our catchphrase. NATION’S MOST HONEST POLITICIAN HONEST CANDIDATE HONEST CANDIDATE CANDIDATE NUMBER 1 JOO SANG-SUK CANDIDATE NUMBER 1 JOO SANG-SUK That’s what elections are like We all wonder, ‘Will my vote make a difference?’ We all doubt ourselves But don’t give up It’s for the good of all For a better tomorrow Be thorough Candidate number one Joo Sang-suk Honest candidate Candidate number one Joo Sang-suk Honest candidate What’s there to say? Everyone. Isn’t my son a cutie? -Yes. -Yes. He’s going to serve in the military. I really didn’t want to send him away. If one says senior welfare is populism, he’s one of two things. A self-centered wealthy person or a politician-- Yes, wealthy people and politicians are the same breed. Aren’t you scared of the growing life expectancy? Will you just trust the uncertain national pension? There’s something fishy if the government tells you to relax, no? Candidate Joo, it’s not your time to respond. Candidate Joo, are you joking? No, I’m not. I’m saying what you said is correct... I need a bathroom break. I’ve been holding for a while, and I’m wearing white. -What? Really? -My apologies. Go with archival footage. Seniors' welfare or whatever. Get the camera running. Camera two! I need baby wipes. I need to poop. Candidate Nam, what’s your opinion on the aging generation? Next topic is about Hyuntan’s... The wealthy and politicians are the same breed. -This is how we joke. -Friendzone. It’s nuts. Isn’t she refreshing being so honest? Please support her. We’re riding high. KIMCHI When will I get a role in Surprise? I’m looking into it. I’ll kill you if you backstab me. CANDIDATE NUMBER 1 JOO SANG-SUK BETTER THAN MOST POLITICIANS. HER FACTS ARE SO DIGESTIBLE. Candidate number one Joo Sang-suk. -It’s really important -Very important Candidate number one Joo Sang-suk Citizens of Hyuntan. Being rich doesn’t buy you happiness. But it’s so cool to toss a Chanel bag in your Ferrari and cry in your Ferrari. I’ll make you live in a rich neighborhood. Why? Can’t a politician speak with conviction? Is it a crime to be honest? HONEST CANDIDATE Who is that? Her son attempted suicide for getting low grades. What? Could you look into it? Well, Mr. Kim ordered us not to look into it. I’m really sorry to say this, but... You have a month to live. Are you okay? Stupid micro dust. I’m not going to die. He’s been saying that for eight years now. Indeed. I think I’m getting used to hearing that. Do you have any prescriptions? Why? Want me to quit them and die as soon as possible? No, how could you say that? Here. Stop coming by. You’re not even my grandson. I’m your legal grandson. Laws are thicker than blood nowadays. I’m Kim Hye-rin, not Kim Ok-hui. Sorry for making you change your name. It’s okay, Hye-rin is a stylish name. Hello. I’m HBS’ Kim Jun-yeong. They claimed that it’ll be the new MIT and drove up the admissions. Look, the son of defense minister. He paid one billion won to get in. Hyuntan’s push for science city started with Ok-hui Science College. It’s rotten from the core. You’re really not going to send this up? I’m going to report it myself. You crazy attention seeker. If you’re going to go big, do it properly. I know. How do I blow this up? -By eating. -What? To put it simply, ‘S’ inherited grandma Ok-hui’s image as the good Samaritan, and started the Ok-hui Foundation. Claiming to do good work, she took bread left and right. With that, she bought a college for dirt cheap. 100 MILLION WON Then, she put a new name to it and reorganized it. Why? Korea’s got a ton of smart but poor students. The college gathered them, saying they’ll give a hundred million breads, like this and this. Like this. They increased the value of the school like that, and then accepted children of VIP families. Taking a billion bread each from them. A billion. What? My school? But the problem is, those who paid to get in gets higher grades. Then what about the smart kids? So as soon as the smart students reported this problem, they got F's! They got scholarships to get in, but because of the punitive scholarship system, they'd get in trouble. Like this, so much bread was coming in, -with so little going out. -The college must be loaded. As a result, they’re sitting on 150 billion bread. One hundred and fifty billion? Are they insane? Son of a... ADJUSTING THE SCREEN ‘S’, I mean ‘SS’. What’ll you do with all these bread? Or have you stashed them already? Can a small time local reporter make such accusations? As the station chief, you can’t control him? You really had an interesting life. Arrange a press conference and respond to this. That’ll only fan the fire. She can’t lie at all. Please send a statement on our behalf. That’s why we brought you in. A fact assaulter can’t explain herself when she’s accused? I don’t care if you cry, kneel, or beg. You have to do it yourself. Will you go down known as a scammer? Mr. Lee... Kim Sang-pyo, answer me. Hurry up. Want me to stop paying your salary? Sir, Assemblywoman Joo’s calling, what should we do? If a tail gets stepped on, cut off the tail, not the foot. Is crashing into cars the only thing you know how to do? My apologies. Hey. Take out all of the Ok-hui Foundation documents. I’m sorry. Do you have noodles for a brain? If this is true, it’s an amazing exclusive. Jeez, 150 billion won? Ok-hui went all out. Ok-hui’s reputation is over now. The door is closing. -Ma’am? -Yes? Where are you going? What? Which floor? You haven’t pushed it. Fourth... I mean, fifth floor. Fifth floor. JAMAICA HEALTH CLUB THE ONE WHO KEEPS HER PROMISE Are you nuts? How could you come here? You’re the crazy one. You used my name to eat up 150 billion won? Tell me I’m wrong. Shoot me with your red lies. Say it out loud. Who knew my prayers would be so effective? Why did you have to make that stupid wish? Why should I get your permission to make a wish? Ask me first next time. My heart breaks whenever I see this. Why did the lightning strike here? I built this for eight years. Did you build this because of me? Of course, I did. For you to grow up. Do we need to bow every time? If you weren’t my grandchild... Kim Ok-hui? Since you caused this, you should return things back to normal. DAEHAN PARTY LEADER KIM SANG-PYO It’s all my fault. People of Hyuntan, you all know that I cannot turn Hyuntan into the best city in Korea. Please take back my wish. Please let her stop saying weird things. I’m begging you, please help. Just let her live like a normal person. What do we do now? You should go home first. Hui-cheol will take you home. I’m sorry for giving you the idea to become a politician. Right, I said I didn’t want to at first. I thought you’d do good, not rot like this. I didn’t rot. You did. You smell so moldy. Go. I should. My legs. My baby, I feel so bad for you. She started the foundation with good intentions. She saw herself in those poor students. We should get you a new house soon. How’s your room, ma’am? I can write tons of apology letters. Just get over here. Did you sell me out? Why should I have a good time with her? Why can’t we have a good time, Mr. Kim Jun-yeong? I’ll be absolutely direct. Could you stop digging into the Ok-hui Foundation? No, I can’t. I asked too much upfront. I simply wanted to help the poor students by taking a wealthy corporation’s money. Is that a crime? Robin Hood did the same. You really think you helped them? Okay, let’s say you didn’t know. Then who took all that money? I’m not confident about that. Drink, I make the best cocktail in Yeouido. I have something to give you. Hold on, let’s see. Eat this too. Do you know what happened to the scholarship students? Sang-suk. Why didn’t you want to know? Are you really rotten? Are you? CANDIDATE NUMBER 1 JOO SANG-SUK There he comes. Why did you decide to split with Candidate Joo? Please say a word on this. We’re splitting up due to the difference in strategies. When will you send out a proper statement? Do you really have to do this? I love to make pancakes. Flipping them always puts a smile on my face. You screwed me over eight years ago thanks to your grandmother. Now it’s your turn. Which hospital was it? I saw that she has a stylish new name. It's unforgivable to lie about the death of your parents in Korea. Your political career is over. Why didn’t you tell me? You can't be seen here. It will be better for you to blame me for not letting you know about it. Doesn’t matter. Nam Yong-seong knows everything. So what? Why is he threatening us instead of going to the media? It's because he hasn’t found any evidence yet. Legally, she’s my grandmother, and they can’t check her face because she’s in the ICU. No one will believe that. Why do you think I'm still on your side? Could it be that you have feelings for me? No! I knew that. You didn't have to deny it so strongly. When you said that even the poor deserve to receive an apology, you looked like Joan of Arc. “Wow, so this is what she's made of. She makes it possible for poor people like us to make a difference.” Since then, I kept supporting you without question through this shit hole that is politics. I wasn’t ashamed or scared of becoming shit stained. I got this far just for you alone. Stop being so honest. It’s getting on my nerves. Everyone in our campaign has bet their lives on you. So do your best. I’ll protect grandma. RESTRICTED AREA Grandma. Candidate number one, Joo Sang-suk. Good luck. Okay. Grandma, I’m sorry. Please give me one more chance. I became a politician 12 years ago while fighting an insurance company who made the poor cry with deceptive fine prints. I earned the nickname ‘thirst-quencher’ and my grandmother was very proud of me. Ma’am. Could you tell me your name? Can you say your name? Check her vitals. But I've become rotten to the core. If you give me one more chance, I’ll go back to how I was back then, and I'll try my best. I’ll right the wrong. My dear Sang-suk. Help her grow up, please. Please. CANDIDATE NUMBER 1 JOO SANG-SUK Why are you doing this? We’re almost there. When you go down, you’ll take all of us down with you. Are you going to be backing Nam Yong-seong instead? Let’s not waste our breaths. Mr. Kim. I can’t quit. I just did what you ordered me to do. The foundation and the college too. I lent you my grandmother’s name because you needed that. But 150 billion won? Your grandmother's not even dead. If that gets out, your candidacy will be voided. Who says? My grandmother is dead. You know how much I respect you. I... I get it. Honey. Honey, I think I’m back. I’m a man, it’s raining. If I’m reborn, I’ll marry you again. My grandmother died a long time ago. We did it. I’m finally back. What’s wrong? HONEST CANDIDATE It’s here. You’re not in contact with your old friends, right? Honey, let’s go. No politician ever stays this long at the funeral of their aide’s relative. I’ll get the car. What are you doing at a funeral? That’s enough. Mr. Park, you’re doing great work. You found a great funeral photo. Did you Google that? Get rid of him. What are you doing? -Stop. Don’t do this. -Step back. Must you do this to the deceased? We want to ID her ourselves before she’s cremated. This is a destruction of evidence. If it’s really Mr. Park’s grandmother, why are you hiding it? Open the door. -Yes. -No, no... -Don’t touch. -Step back! Get out of here. She’s so strong. If you step all over me like this, I won’t just stay put. Get ready to write an apology to the entire nation. Should I get the media? All of you, please! Just stop it. I’ll drop out. Ms. Joo. Really? You know that I can’t lie. Mr. Kim, who I love and respect... I’ll take full responsibility, so please head back. Can we really just leave? Can you trust her? You love and respect them? Hui-cheol. She’s not someone to give up so easily. Why did you come here? You’ve part ways with her. This is my reputation. Right, loyalty. Do you have something that she could use against you? No, nothing like that. Mr. Kim took care of the last hidden camera. Hidden camera? Well, it’s nothing. No way, she was in it too... Joo Sang-suk. Since you’re a pro, I thought you may have kept an original copy. It’s right here. Here. Fifty million won, please. Holy... That’s worth a hundred million won. Could I get fifty million won in change? Who keeps fifty million won around? Forget it, take it back. No, wait a minute. I’m flustered. You don’t have fifty million won? -Okay, deal. -No, I can’t. -No. -Why? -Okay. Let’s go with 100 million won. -What? -Seriously? -Yes. This is the original, right? Yes, thank you. Thank you too. Thank you. She said she’ll get me a used car. I could’ve died if I hadn't taken the change. Don’t follow me. You're like a bumper car! I saw Mr. Kim go through here once. Mr. Kim? Where? It’s here. Huh? What? There was a secret room here? They’ll never look for you in their own hideout. Come out when the voting is over. This is worth fifty million won. We won’t ever use it, but it’s our final piece of leverage, so keep it well. You need to be elected to expose the truth. I’m off. Mr. Park. I know I’m working hard. Leave the car. Did you get a new car? It’s the used car you got me. SCHOLARSHIP REFUND PROTOCOL I would want to die too if they ask for the scholarship back like this. 114TH DAY OF OK-HUI COLLEGE STUDENT CHOI SEUL-GI IN COMA MY SON TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE WHEN COLLEGE WANTED THE SCHOLARSHIP BACK I’m so sorry. Mrs. Choi. I’m really sorry. Joo Sang-suk. Shit. I’m in a hurry, I’ll be back. I promise. Where are you going? Park, where’s the car? You got the flash drive, right? That will ruin you too. Hey! HUSBAND -Honey. Are you okay? -Yeah, hey. Where are you? I’m with Mr. Park. It’s been so long since I last drove. I'm sorry. Uploading a video of her driving would lose her thousands of votes. Pull up. Joo Sang-suk. Stop the car. Hey! Lee Un-hak! You're such a traitor! Joo Sang-suk. You okay? Are you hurt? I don't know, I’m okay. There’s a car coming at me. Oh my gosh. A car is coming at me. Crazy bastard, he was driving straight at me. Swallow it? -Sang-suk. -Assemblywoman Joo. I don’t believe this. -Joo Sang-suk. -Gosh. Come on, get out. You conniving bastard. What did you call me? -Fuck you, asshole. -Open this door. What the hell, man. -Assemblywoman Joo, are you hurt? -Go stop them. Honey, where are you? Over here. I came quickly, right? Only I can be this quick. Hey. Sir, you take that side. Will you be okay? Of course. It's me. I was an athletics major. What’s with the mood? -Is it just the three of you? -Go away, you can’t come here. You’ll get hurt. You really don’t listen, huh? I haven’t done this in a while. -It’s in the car. -It’s not here. -Where... -No, there. There’s no way out. Get back here. Are you okay? Piggybacking? Stay right there. Hold on. You might not believe me, but I fight really well. I said I fight well. Sang-suk, what’s with you? Give me the flash drive. -I don’t have it. -Where is it? -Honey. -Assemblywoman Joo. What are you doing? Don’t tense up, you’ll hurt your shoulder. It makes me mad as hell, when you talk like that to my wife. It makes it seem like you two are close friends! Honey, hit somewhere that’s not noticeable. -Not noticeable? -What do you think you’re doing? Careful, I’m closing the door. You son of a bitch. Honey, get going. Grab her. Be careful, Assemblywoman Joo. Hey, Joo Sang-suk. I’m so sorry. I’ll break your spine. Taxi. Just drive. I’m in a hurry. Wait a minute. Ma’am, where to? What? Where are you heading to? You said you’re in a hurry. I don’t know. CANDIDATE NUMBER 1 JOO SANG-SUK I thought you’d do good, not rot like this. I didn’t rot. You really think you helped them? I’m so sorry. Mrs. Choi. Do it right. Take it. -What is it? -A gift. A big scoop. Joo as in Joo Sang-suk? You’re giving yourself up? Why? I don’t know, maybe I’ve grown up. Don’t fall for me. YEOUIDO JOO Hold on. Where are you going? What’s with him? My gosh. No way. Something unbelievable happened to me a few days ago. CANDIDATE JOO SANG-SUK DECLARATION OF RESIGNATION It was a short time, but it was an important time that I got to reflect on myself. I’ll come clean and confess everything. I-- -Candidate Joo. -Ma’am. -Since when were you... -Candidate Joo. How did you obtain the videos? Are you ready to face legal retributions? How did you come to this conclusion? -What's this? -No idea. Why did you expose everyone? Everyone? We have a shocking news. People are up in arms, seeing politicians -behaving badly. -Corruption, assault, sexual favors, videos of all these accusations... We’ve finally uncovered the identity of the infamous public urination perp. He’s none other than Congressman Hong Bang-sik, he was never identified or captured for a long... This is a footage from Yeouido Joo. Known as the people's father, Assemblyman Choi Young-seok... Investigation petition has reached over a million signatures in a day. Assemblyman Choi Young-tae, who charged a woman for assault was caught taking an upskirt photo prior to the assault. Daehan’s Party Leader Kim Sang-pyo was seen gambling at the party HQ. Mr. Kim thought of the public as moronic pigs. When the reporters tracked down Mr. Kim for an interview, he fled the scene immediately. ‘Yeouido Joo’ was essentially ‘Yeouido Zoo.’ How did I confuse J with Z? Zoo was the most expensive drive. I worked so hard to collect that set. THE LATE KIM OK-HUI Good bye, grandma. Candidate Shin Ji-seon won the election after beating Candidate Joo, who dropped out before ballot counting. Although Mr. Kim was found to be behind Ok-hui Foundation, Candidate Joo has decided to voluntarily get investigated by the prosecution JOO SANG-SUK’S SENSIBLE JAIL DIARY 2 YEARS LATER Breakfast is ready. Are you uncomfortable with Candidate Nam running for mayor, who lost to you by just eight votes? Not at all. If he wins, I’ll gladly buy him a drink to congratulate him. We have to help each other for Hyuntan to grow, right? Your hairstyle sure looks nice. I wish Hyuntan would go under. How could you say that? If you hate the president, will you want the country to go under? How many racquets do you have? Are you aiming for the nationals? Well, it's not like you’re employed. How was my show yesterday? Wasn’t it awesome? I could be the lead soon. -Why don’t you give it up? -What? You look like a show-off, and your acting is bad. I'm just glad that I didn't have to pay for the ticket. No way. Everyone’s saying they love it. Probably just the 32 people in your fan club. Then give me money for acting classes. Me too. I need to buy lunch for my badminton club because I've become president. I don't have any. What about the royalties from the book? I used it to pay Seul-gi’s hospital bill. Wasn't he discharged? I gave him a lifetime scholarship. -What? What about us then? -What? What about us then? Like father, like son. You two are so alike. Able-bodied men like you should be contributing to our society. What if I die first? You’ll resort to getting loans and be under a ton of debt. You’ll be sold off to a shrimp boat and your organs will be sold off. You'll eat shit, and you'll be locked up like a slave. If you don’t want to live like that, get your act together starting today. I’m off. Enjoy the rest of your meal. The stew’s overcooked. It’s Candidate Joo. How do you feel about entering the race for the Seoul mayoral election? They agreed not to mention your prison sentence. So if you can go easy on certain topics... You’ve changed. Will people forget I was in prison if I go easy on them? I’m just saying that we should go easy since it’s your first debate. Trust me. I am "the people's grenade". She should have bought herself a new pair of shoes. Did you see my column? I gave you a push. Mr. Kim. Your job as the media is to maintain a neutral position. Now that you’re a star journalist and only care about TV shows like this, your articles have lost their bite. I liked her more when she lied. CANDIDATE NUMBER 7 JOO SANG-SUK Good afternoon. I’m Kim Jun-yeong, and this is the 38th Seoul mayoral election debate. With the election only ten days away, the campaigning is heating up. But independent candidates had little chance to disclose their policies. Please let her make a ton of money. We’re so poor that we sew our undies when they rip. Please help her refrain from going on a truth tirade. My ears are about to bleed. My mom suffered a heart failure because of Sang-suk. Do something about her tongue, I’m sick of it. She didn’t give me the 300 million won after my military service. She promised me 3 billion won. Change her back to how she was before. Please. -Please. -Please. Hello, I’m a Seoul mayoral candidate Joo Sang-suk. Subtitle translation by Tae-hui Cho Ripped and synced by TTEOKBOKKIsubs
