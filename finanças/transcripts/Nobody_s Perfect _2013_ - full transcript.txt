MATSUURA WEST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GRADE 5, CLASS 3 Quiet down! Quiet! Wait up. Well, come on. Get back inside. Sorry we're late. Starting today, I am your new teacher. Shinnosuke Akao. As you can see... I was born without arms or legs. That leaves a lot I can't do. So at times if you think, "Oh, Teacher's trouble." I'd appreciate your help. I will be assisting Mr. Akao. I'm Yusaku Shiraishi. Let's take roll. Misaki Tanaka. Here. Eiyu Tajima. Haruhito Yamazaki. Yui Urakawa. Taichi Nakayama. Aika Hashimoto. When Shinnosuke was hired as a schoolteacher... it was under the condition that I serve as his aide. And while I had recommended him, I admit that I had some reservations. But I knew he had something that only he could offer. And I... I wanted another chance to connect with children. Momoka Kurata. Yumi Maezono. I'm looking forward to a great year. Afternoon. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Excuse us. It's unheard of. A teacher late on his first day. I hear you were a teacher prior to being a school board member. How could you let this happen? My apologies. And you asked the children to help you when in trouble? Yes. We're their teachers. We are supposed to be helping them. You would do well to be more cognizant of your role. There's a great yakitori place nearby. We should go sometime. - That'd be great. - Thanks. Let's go, Ayano. I'll go on ahead. Ayano? I'm worried. About what? I would've preferred a regular teacher. Really? It doesn't bother me. Satoko? Here's that book. Thanks. Okay, let's try another one. If one person needs 2.4 metres of fabric how much total fabric would 10 people require? Don't throw that. How much would 10 people need? Anyone? 2.4 metres per person. Who knows the answer? Good, hands are up. Okay, Satoko. 24 metres. I can't hear! - 24 metres. - Correct! No throwing! Curry! Curry! Curry! Curry! Milk! Milk! Milk! Milk! All right, time to eat! Lunch monitor, do the honours. Let us now eat. Yes, let us eat. You want to know how I eat? Here, I'll show you. First, I wedge it in there. Then... I push down and like a lever, it rises. Then I just bring my mouth to the food. That's awesome. No way! Now eat before your precious curry gets cold. Yeah, eat up! - Dig in! - Sit down! Stop it. Eat normally. Don't try to copy him. I can't! Shh! Quietly. Take it slow and easy. And keep it quiet. Careful. Gently, gently. Bad idea. It's fun, you chicken. We should've got permission. Don't worry. Let's go. Teacher, is it okay to be out here? What could be better? Then, let's do it every day. All right. Let's begin. Okay. Homeroom activity. Okay. To decide our class theme. Okay. Takuto. Lots of comic books! No homework! Get serious. A class full of clowns! One clown is enough. What about you, Kohei? I don't care what it is. And you, Boo? No fighting. We'd all like that, right Kohei? Shut up. A cooperative class! A neat and tidy class. That's impossible. A cheerful class! Everyone's cheerful but you. That's mean. Any other ideas? How about you, Ayano? I'm not interested. But you're one of us. You don't have to speak. Just close your book. Got any more ideas? Professor. Here it comes. How about a class of all smiles? A "class of all smiles?" Yes, to make this class fun for everyone. That's be a good class. Leave it to the Professor. Everyone agreed on a class of all smiles? Agreed! Let's move to choosing class officers. Any volunteers? NOBODY'S PERFECT You can't just do what you want. He's the type who acts on inspiration. Special hire doesn't mean he has carte blanche. He just thought class would be more fun under the cherry blossoms. More fun? This isn't summer camp. And you're a former teacher, too. I'm sorry. I did try to discourage him. Homeroom under the cherry blossoms certainly does sound like fun. It is. But I'm afraid I can't sanction that kind of activity. What if the other classes start asking for it? We'd have our hands full. We'll let it go this one time. Thank you. Sounds fun, though. Right? It leads to bigger problems. Like? Like parents calling the school with questions. How come my kid's class doesn't get to do that? Are parents that much of a pain? There's always the parent from hell. Remember that crazy parent from your last school? How crazy? They blamed us for their kid's dropping grades. They'd call to complain from morning till night. Just ignore them. I tried that. But then they'd show up at school screaming at us. We try calling 30 times, but nobody answers. That's irrational! Unbelievable. They're the irrational one. I admit I was relieved when the school board hired me. I was losing my wits. You're kidding. I thought the board hand-picked you due to talent. Perhaps. But as a teacher, I failed. Yet you're not giving up. I suppose not. Teachers used to have more authority. Like Mr. Iwatani? Who's that? My grade school teacher. He ordered nobody to help Shinnosuke. What? During PE class I was always left out and had to return to class alone. You climbed the stairs by yourself. That's terrible! But he called my parents after school every night. He gave them a daily report on my progress. I didn't find out till later. I'm home. Welcome back. - What did you eat? - Okonomiyaki. - Again? - At Miyuki's. You sure like it. What movie shall we see tomorrow? I don't think I can go. Why not? Class prep. Telephone tree and student roster. Also the grade and class newsletter. There's a lot for a new teacher. Isn't that Shinnosuke's job? Yes, it is. Then why do you need to do all that for him? It's not for him. It's for me. Before I was obsessed with the parents. It kept me from doing my job. Now, I want to focus on the kids. Whatever that takes, I'll do it. I see. Hey. Morning! Morning, Teacher. - It's Boo. - What's up? A problem with his indoor shoes. Let's go see. Morning, kids. What's up? Boo's school shoes are missing. Did you look well? Yes, but they're nowhere. That is a problem. For now, go on up to class. I'll be up shortly. But my shoes. Yes. I know. Just wear your street shoes today. You can wipe them on that mat. Thanks Hiroto. Is anyone wearing the wrong shoes? Boo's feet are too big for anyone to wear his by mistake. Exactly. They'll turn up. Yeah. I'm sure they will. Let's all look for Boo's shoes after school. Now let's get ready for first period. Found them! What? Really? These yours? Nope. Found 'em? Not yet. Why don't you help? Waste of time. How so? What's lost is lost. Yeah. Maybe you hid them, Kohei. Why suspect me? You're always teasing Boo. What? We just kid around. Right? Stop it! Screw you! Just keep looking. No luck at the other entrance. Did you look hard? Yes! - Try the gym. - Okay. Oh no! Mine are gone, too! Oh, thanks. Could it be a classmate? 80 percent of the time it is. Your first response is critical. The more it drags on, the more trouble. It can even lead to class breakdown. Are you trying to scare me? Here you are. I'll get it. - Thanks. - No sweat. - Your mixed yakitori. - Thanks. Hard times for teachers. They're quitting in droves after being driven neurotic by students. But who would do such a thing, and why? Could be an SOS. SOS? A student who's struggling. What do I do? I don't want to sound cold, but that's for their teacher, Mr. Akao, to work out. It's his class after all. A person's shoes don't walk off by themselves. I think someone must've taken them. Who's the jerk that took them!? As for me, I'm less interested in who than why someone would take them. That person might've had their own reason for doing it. As a reaction to some pain they're feeling. If that's the case I'd like that person to come to me about it. You don't care to know who did it, then? We just let them get away with it? Hey, everybody you can do whatever you want in this class. Awesome. It doesn't mean that. Sure it does. You're wrong. How so? The person who took the shoes... is probably feeling really bad about it. Yeah, I'm sure they'll confess when they're ready to. Likely story. What's your problem? Knock it off! Sit down! Now! Why take someone's shoes? Maybe out of frustration, like Mr. Akao said. What frustration? I don't know. But maybe this was the only thing they could think of to do. You sure it's frustration? Maybe it's just to be mean. Bye bye! See you Monday! - Later! - Bye! Thanks for the book. How'd you like it? It was a little difficult. I'll lend you an easier one next. Ayano. - Hi, Mum. - Classmate? Satoko. - Hello. - Hello. Care to come in for a snack? Better not. We've got to study, right? Sorry. See you later. I'm sorry. Come visit again. - Okay, goodbye. - Goodbye. Let your teacher play. Let me play, guys. I'm out of here. Me, too. Me too, then. I've got cram school. I'll go too, then. Sorry, Teacher. Next time. - Me, too. - And me. Me three. Wait up. I'll be going, too. Teacher, let's call it a day. Hey. Looks like we'll be going head-to-head at Field Day again. Probably. I plan on beating you again. I'm not expecting to beat you. What was that? Don't let him say that. So what? Tell him off. Tell him you'll win. Why? I can't beat him. How do you know? What's it to you? Hey, what's going on? Cut it out! Break it up! Enough! What's the problem here? What happened? Tell me, Kohei. Yosuke, what is it? Good Bye. Bye. Kohei was the fastest runner in his grade. Until last year when Masaya Noda transferred in. Kohei's been dethroned. And kids these days don't mind losing? You kidding? Some schools make all the kids cross the finish line holding hands. Kohei doesn't care about winning. I doubt that's true. He wants to win but has lost the courage. If he says he'll win and doesn't, it looks bad. Okay kids, listen up while you're eating! About the 100-metre dash at our upcoming Field Day. There are 14 races of 2 students from each class. 6 per race. I've got an idea. What if our class tried to win all 14 races? That's never going to happen. Teacher. Just the odds alone are staggering. Yes, I understand the difficulty. But if somehow you manage to win every race I'll let you do anything you want. Really? Anything? Within reason. Don't ask me to buy you something. What if you shaved your head? That's an idea! Our teacher bald? I like it. What do you say? All right, all right. I'll promise. If you win every 100-metre dash at our upcoming Field Day event... I, your teacher will shave my head. How about the Professor. With Yuto... Check. 2nd race girls. You're a boy, Boo. 2nd race is Honoka and... Hey Shingo, Wasshi. We're out of here. Kohei. What about practice? I'll pass. Why? Even Teacher's going to be there. You guys go have fun. Leave me out of it. Don't be a pussy. Say what? Kohei. Stop it. Kohei. Suit yourself. Shingo and Wasshi are coming, right? Go if you want. - Kohei! - Wait! One, two! One, two! Last spurt! Last spurt! Lift those knees! Swing those arms! Let's go! Last push! Bear down! Grind it out! Go, go, go! You're almost there! Fight, fight, fight! Last spurt, last spurt! What is it? I'm pooped. Just a little more. But they're stairs. Race me, then. Loser does 50 squats. - No way! - Ready? Set, go! Go, go, go! You can do it! Little more! Almost there. That a boy! Swing your arms! Last push, come on! Go, go, go! Okay, once more! Go back, go back! Hinako. Where's Kohei? Don't know. This way! Hurry! Ready, go! Go Shingo! Go! Nice choice. This is a much better place to practice. Question. What team did Mr. Akao play on in high school? I don't know. American football. - Really? - Really. How? Yeah. There's no way with his body that he could play that sport. But he wanted his buddies to win more than anything. So he crunched stats, studied formations, did odd jobs. He thought about football from morning to night. So when his school won regionals he cried like a baby. Everyone's giving their all to try and win! The class is united. I want you to... try your best. Just show them... that you're with them. On your mark... Too soon. Ready? You won't win if you wait till after you hear the gun fire. Anticipate it and go. Okay. On your mark, set... Slow. Good, good. MATSUURA WEST ELEMENTARY: SPRING FIELD DAY Good morning! My favourite day of the year. Field Day, has at last arrived. How heartwarming it is to see so many parents and guests turning out today in support. You have our most heartfelt gratitude. The teachers and I have watched you prepare for this day. We've seen how hard you've worked. And today, at last, you will all shine with the fruits of your labour. This is what Field Day is all about. This is why it's my favourite day. Give it your best effort and enjoy yourself. Next is the 5th grade inter-class 100-metre dash. Thanks. Here we are. Go kick butt. Give it everything you've got, all right? Let's win this! Let's do it! Good luck. Hey! Good luck. First runners, take your mark. Get set... Yes! Get set... Go, go, go, go! You can do it! Takuto's flying! Go Boo! Hang in there! Get set... Get set... Listen up. Get a good start. Don't worry about jumping the gun. Win this and Class 3 sweeps the event. Got it? Let's make Mr. Akao shave his head. We'll win, I promise. Good! Go do it! Group 14, take your mark. Get set... Kohei. You did good. Yeah, but not good enough. You did good. Great effort. Right? Don't cry. You did your best? Right? I let everyone down. No, you didn't. You did great. We came so close. Kohei was gaining, too. But Noda proved faster. Don't say that, Teacher. Yeah. Kohei and Yosuke ran their hardest. Yeah, that's more important, right? Yes. As a matter of fact look at the empty box on the board. "[ ] over results." What word goes here? Eiyu. Guts. Guts, good. Haruhito. Practice. Any others? Kimihiko. Growth? Exactly. Growth? GROWTH OVER RESULTS Unfortunately, we failed to produce the desired result. But this past month you put in a huge amount of effort. That result was growth. What's more important than the result is that through effort, you grew stronger. Do you remember Mr. Akao's promise? Sure we do. If we won all 14 races, he'd shave his head. Right. You guys did great. Your effort led to 13 victories. How about we shave 13/14ths of Mr. Akao's head? Ta-dah! We'll all take turns! Kohei leads off! Come on! Yes! Hold it, hold it! Wait a second! The deal was I'd shave if we won all 14 races. Yes, but if you're recognizing everyone's effort then you've got to show it. Shave it! Shave it! Shave it! Okay, okay, okay! Yes, you all worked really hard this past month. Therefore in recognition of that effort, and your growth... I'll shave my head. Glasses! Here goes! Reverse mohawk! Go Kimihiko! More in the middle. The front. The last stroke! Right here. Tatsuya. Honoka. Shingo. Kimihiko. Ayano. Absent again. Faito. Aika. Shota. Yosuke. Satoko. Koji. Ayano, your teachers are here! Come on down. Excuse her. She refuses to leave her room. Thank you. Ayano's big sister. I'm Yoshimi. Hello. Hello. I made these. Please try some. Yoshimi's quite a baker. You don't say. Thank you. Looks great. Thanks. Delicious. Fabulous. Thanks, Yoshimi. Our family went to the zoo over summer vacation. Yoshimi stood in front of the elephant cage and wouldn't leave. She seemed fascinated. She kept moving her hands, mimicking the elephant. She thought everyone would find it funny. So she kept on doing it. Since that day she's locked herself up in her room. You believe that's the reason? I think so. Ma'am. Yes? May I? Uh, sure. Excuse him. Ayano. Your teacher really wants to help you. But he doesn't know how yet. So please... let me think it over. And I'll return. But Ayano? It'll be all right. I promise you. It's all right. GRADE 4, CLASS 3 ALL WORKING TOGETHER Here. Thank you. Staring at it's not going to make it move. Quiet. At any rate... Action! Dear Ayano, Since you stopped coming to school every day's been a sad one for me. Even the absence of one student saddens me. I'm sure you have a good reason for not coming. Maybe, I'm the cause of it. If that's the case, I'm really sorry. But even so I still wish you would come to school. There are 27 of your friends there waiting for you. I've changed the schedule for 5th period today. To Ethics class. Will you give me another chance? I really hope you'll come. Give her this. Mr. Akao! Thank you. What's this? A blank? What word do you think goes in this box? - Akimasa! - Why? Anything else? "I think [ ]'s body is weird." Kimihiko. Mr. Akao. Correct. Ayano! How've you been? Class is in session. Back to your seats. You okay? Welcome back, Ayano. Okay, let's continue. As you can see your teacher's body is considerably different from yours. So would you call it "weird?" Yosuke. Not exactly weird, but with no arms or legs, I'd say "surprising." I got used to it. Yumi. Do you think of yourself as strange? Well, I'm definitely not ordinary. I can't do a lot. Like open a milk bottle. Or peel an orange. Or go to the bathroom by yourself. Nope. But there's a lot you can do. Like eat! Obviously. Your handwriting's better than ours. Better than yours, for sure. You can climb stairs. Do the computer. You're smart. You went to a top school. But you still can't call no arms or legs "ordinary." You don't have to be ordinary. Yeah. I don't even know what "ordinary" is. Okay then, what is "ordinary?" Hinako? Having a name? Haruhito. Just common sense. Common sense? Wasshi. It means in most cases. Honoka. When we say "everyone." Kimihiko. Isn't an overwhelming majority what we call "ordinary?" So, my not having arms and legs puts me in an overwhelming minority. So this body is "strange" after all. Yeah. But it's not just people with disabilities like your teacher. There are lots of disabilities, such as being blind or deaf. And it's not just disabilities. Your skin colour, the way you speak. Or your religion. People have various differences. We have a tendency to label minorities as strange. We make fun of them for not being ordinary. They're strange 'cause they're different. Bad for being unique. Isn't that how it works? But strange is strange. You're stranger than anyone, fool. About time someone told him. A minority might be considered strange, but that doesn't mean bad. That's right. Being different is fine. You are you. Strange but not bad. So a body like mine may be "strange," but not necessarily "no good." You are who you are. Exactly. You can be normal and still no good. You mean him? No, you! For sure. How was school? You're going back, right? None of your business. Ayano. Is it my fault you're not going? No, it's not! Now leave me alone! I'm sorry. Is it good? It's good. Your cookies are the best in the world. I added cinnamon the way you like. I'm glad. Come from behind! No, the score's tied! Special rule! Teacher's goals are double, remember? Take your seats. I have an announcement. Okay, ready? Turn around Kohei. About your field trip... I can't take part in the hike. What? I'll stay here. Mr. Shiraishi will be in charge. Do as he says, please. Sorry. You're late. Sorry. I don't want to go on a field trip without our teacher. Yeah, it'll be boring. I was looking forward to eating lunch with him. Any ideas, Professor? Climbing a mountain in that wheelchair's impossible. We shouldn't force him, though. You don't want him along, Ayano? What a drag. I wish it didn't have to be hiking. That's it. I've got it! See ya! See ya. See you tomorrow. Bye, Boo. I'm back! Bye Professor. See you. Later. See you tomorrow. Koji. Thanks. Welcome! Thank you. "Petition to request change in field trip destination. Grade 5, Class 3." Yosuke. It's finished. Thanks. Morning. Mr. Shiraishi will serve as field trip leader for your class. With pleasure. Excuse us. We're Class 3, Grade 5. Excuse me. What's all this? We want Mr. Akao on our field trip. These are our petitions. We tried to think of a way we could all go together. We discussed it. If hiking is out of the question, then let's change plans. Matsuura Botanical Gardens? Can we change to an orienteering trip in groups? The park is barrier free for wheelchairs. Please consider it, Ms. Principal. Please, Ms. Principal. Hold on. We can't change plans for one teacher. But it wouldn't be a class field trip without him. It was decided long ago that Mr. Akao would not be taking part in the autumn field trip. He himself agreed to it. Thanks, everybody. I appreciate the gesture. But climbing a mountain in a wheelchair just isn't practical. Please go with Mr. Shiraishi. That's not right! You're always telling us not to say "can't," but to make an effort. Yeah. It's the effort that's important, right? - That's right! - Come on! Come with us, Teacher! Quiet everyone! Just be quiet! You would force your teacher to endure such hardship? Ms. Aoyagi. Let's say one class had a child in a wheelchair, then what? Would you leave him out of the trip? Could you make that decision? Of course not. We would most certainly take him. What about you, Mr. Konno? We'd think of a way I suppose. To make it work. Ms. Principal? I agree with all of you completely. I want Mr. Akao to go on the field trip, too. But we can't have one class of three changing plans for the entire 5th grade. Let's keep hiking as this year's field trip. We may not be able to get a wheelchair to the summit. But take part as far as is reasonably possible, Mr. Akao. That way, everybody will be happy. Okay. Is that okay, kids? Yeah! Yes! We did it! Teacher! Thank you, everyone. Look, Mt. Fuji! It's a bit tricky here. Lift up. Ready? Go! Okay? It gets steep now. - Watch your footing, it's slippery. - Help him out. You all right, Haruhito? You can do it. We're falling behind. Keep going. Can you get through? Good, good. Go Haruhito, pull! Let's rest a bit. If you don't hurry, you won't make the return time. Hold this for me. I'll carry him. Grab the chair. Ready and up! Everything's fine. Let's go. A little further. Keep hustling. - Yusaku. - What? Enough. This is enough. Understood. Listen up! We'll wait here. You kids go to the summit and eat lunch. What's wrong? Go ahead. I'm staying with Mr. Akao. What? Me, too. Not fair. I'm staying, too. - So am I! - Me too! All right, all right. We'll break for lunch here. Don't wander off. What're you reading, Ayano? Kenji Miyazawa. Ayano. Want to skip rope? Come on. Tireless energy. I have a recurring nightmare. The schools' on fire. I'm supposed to get the kids to safety, but I'm helpless. Meanwhile, the flames spread. Just when I think we're finished... I wake up. Why the downer? You're lucky. You can run and play with the kids. I envy that. I'm the envious one. I wish I knew the secret to your strength. I'm not strong. I'm weak so I act strong. My physical handicap, perhaps. Some walls just can't be scaled. I don't believe that. Right now... the other classes are at the summit taking in a breathtaking view as they eat. But because of me, Class 3 is... Take a look around. Look at the smiles. I couldn't create a class like that. So I ran from the classroom. Whereas you have always had the incredible power to change things. It's awesome. So he says... The field trip was supposed to be a group activity. But Class 3 threw everyone off schedule by falling behind. - What a jerk. - Yeah. Then the principal chimes in and says "Of all the classes..." Class 3 came back looking the proudest. She praised Shinnosuke. I like your principal. You should've seen the look on the vice-principal's face. Priceless. What a pathetic little man. Ultimately, Class 3 had a richer experience than the others. So there's really nothing the vice-principal can say. How's that beer taste? Fantastic. "A Bell, A Bird and Me" by Misuzu Kaneko Though I spread my arms wide I cannot fly but even a little But the little bird who flies Cannot run fast on the ground like me Though I shake my body I cannot produce a beautiful sound But the bell that rings sonorously Does not know as many songs as me The bell, the little bird and, finally, me We're all different, but we're all good. We're all different, but we're all good. The poem's last line. What is it that's different, but good? Kyoko. Everyone's good points. Certainly. But that's not all. Kimihiko. Our limitations, weaknesses. Exactly. What limitations are mentioned? Can't fly. Can't run fast. Can't make a pretty sound. Don't know many songs. That's right. A lot of limitations are listed there. Everyone has things they can and cannot do. But that's only natural. Everyone has... their good points. And everyone without exception has things they just cannot do. But here's the thing. Since everyone has things they can't do it does little good to envy others or be too hard on yourself. Okay, turn over your papers. "I can't [ ], but I can [ ]." I want you to write something you can't do in the first blank. And in the second blank... Something we can. A good point. Exactly. This will give us a glimpse into the individuality of each of us. Class 3 couldn't climb to the summit. But we had the best field trip. This is Class 3's personality. I want you to try writing about yourselves. Okay, let's give it a shot. I've got lots of "cants," but nothing worth praising. Not true. You've got strengths unique to you. What could it be? Anyone ready? I want you to read them to the class. Kimihiko. I can't do a single chin-up. But I'm confident in my test scores. That's very you. Anyone else? Momoka? I don't talk much but I've been learning English since kindergarten. Wow. Great. Others? Ayano. I... What's wrong? My sister is a bit different from everyone. But she's really good at making cookies. I'm sorry. But I took Boo and Satoko's shoes. I have a sister with Down's syndrome. Last summer, we went to the zoo. My sister started imitating an elephant in front of everyone. I could see people looking at her and snickering. Seeing people laugh at her made me really angry. I couldn't get that out of my head. I started thinking of my sister as not normal. I stopped wanting to be around her. Must've been hard. Ayano. Seeing me every day was also a constant reminder of your sister. I felt really bad about feeling bad. I know that my sister and Mr. Akao didn't deserve it. I mean, I love my sister. And I love my teacher. Thank you. Every time I felt annoyed at my sister I wondered why because I love her so much. I didn't understand it. So I began to hate myself. When I was skipping school, you came to my house. You said to me, "It's all right." That made me happy. I have bad feelings sometimes but I still love my sister. So I shouldn't keep punishing myself over it. I realized that it was all right. I felt so relieved. Thank you. Teacher. I'm short-tempered and quickly get into fights. But no one beats me at soccer. I can't express myself very clearly most of the time. But I won a prize in a piano competition. I suck at sports. But I can do a reverse flip on the exercise bar. I can be a little careless, but I see things through. I'm terrible at maths, but I bake a pretty mean cake. I don't have an aggressive nature. But I can beat anyone at computer games. Basically, I'm short. But I'm the best cartoonist in this class. I can't do maths at all, but at judo I can beat teenagers. I've got no brains, but I've got looks. Who says? Boo, Satoko... I'm so sorry. I don't know what got into me. You can stop apologizing. It's clear from this that everyone has forgiven you. Don't cry. Sit. It's okay. Hinako. I'm a bit spacey, but I take good care of my stuffed animals. Faito. I'm not good at listening to the teacher. But I do better on tests than Shingo. No comparing! Okay, Yumi. I'm bad at Language Arts. But I'm great at long-distance running. I don't have a handsome face. But it can make you laugh. Show us, then. Nanami. I do things at my own pace, but when I move, I really move. I tend to think the worst of things. But I'm a good listener. I make a lot of silly mistakes. But I'm pretty good at making people smile. I'm kind of a klutz, but I'm very good at origami. Taichi. I can be a little proud and stuck up. But I can hang with anybody. Stuck up? Really? Haruhito. I'm bad at learning kanji characters. But I know tons about Space. It's true. You're waiting outside? Sure, why not? School's ending soon. Any verdict yet? On what? On Shinnosuke. No. You mean I waste a year waiting? Waiting? For you. I wanted to talk to you, but you were always so busy with school. I had a lot to say. Really? Like what? I forgot. Tell me. About home. It was tough sometimes dealing with things by myself. But you were usually occupied with Shinnosuke that I couldn't say anything. It's frustrating... I learned I couldn't survive on my own. Neither can I. I'm helpless by myself. But... that's a minor problem. Just ask for a little help. Nobody can live alone, you know. Shinnosuke showed me that. Please... lean on me a bit. Really? Uh-oh. Tricked. Why? You said to lean on you. Yeah, I meant a little. Okay. I want to travel. Fine, we can travel during spring break. To Italy. Wait, not domestic? - And France. - Hold it! The year has passed so quickly. But your minds and bodies have all definitely grown a size or two. Field Day, the autumn field trip, choral concert and craft exhibit. You poured heart and soul into all of these. Today, when you return home, look at your report cards. For there you'll find the personalised words of your teachers who carefully monitored you, guided you, and watched you grow. Read it and reflect on the year gone by. And when next year comes around picture how you want to be, your new goals. For those who will just be starting elementary school as 1st graders prepare yourselves to be mature and worthy mentors capable of strong guidance and friendship. Thanks for everything. I am indebted to you. You had me wrapped around your finger all year. I apologize. None needed. You're a good teacher. Thanks to you, Class 3 became very self-reliant. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. You, too. You coming? How about one last look at the class? You're on. Mr. Akao didn't have arms or legs but he was the best teacher for us. Yusaku. Thank you. I didn't do a thing. You met the kids honestly and head on. And they responded. That's all it took.
