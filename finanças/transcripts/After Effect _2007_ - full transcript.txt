Maybe I'll just cancel everything don't pretend a budget like this is nothing special animals the longer I think about it, animals just don't interest me I'm scared they're just gonna ignore us I just talked to max marshall. they're not impressed with the animal + logo idea why wouldn't they be interested all of a sudden? Yea, I don't know. rena yazka seemed extremely pissed off that was kind of embarrassing. didn't you notice, mayer of generali was pretty annoyed don't overrate rena yazka somehow she has a strong influence you think that because you've made her 0 important. just talk with her she's not the only one whose unhappy. max marshall is too he's just copying her that's what I'm saying - yazka's controlling them it was all too do-it-yourself picking up models from the street doesn't mean we have to roam the streets too we should have hired an agent finally, my brother kai, the >model made it to generali there were only some of us left and they were asking him if he's the >animal-model why >animal-model They interpreted your speech yesterday that way, ... logos .. animals .. 2 models... no, I've got nothing against generali or anybody else my last project was done with the help of a big spanish investor, you know that I just said, I don't know how much time I've got left in berlin and that I don't know yet, if I am interested in your ideas about logos + animals tomorrow we'll make a new start with the models and then hire an agent to find new ones that's not the point. we don't have to talk about it. For me, your idea is an offer, that's all rainer halbwachs has already prepared something we're extremely glad we got him for the project. last year he finished at king's college yes? Rena, have you met halbwachs? I love jessie jessie is my cat I love jessie .80 far... carl celler asked me to come up with a little introduction without being too explicit. Yeah, hello, this is celler again. I'll be with you in 10 minutes yeah, hello, this is celler again. I'll be with you in 10 minutes ok. mr. hantler hasn't arrived yet. then I'll wait maybe, no no problem everybody's arrived, the scholarship-holders are all there, highly motivated a network of activities is starting to spread. It's incredible that's marvelous yea and? The municipality has to react, too animals + logos, for me, that's really interesting there are so many companies that use animals jagermeister for example, the us 1-dollar-bill yea since 9-11 the dollar-bill doesn't have an eagle anymore yea, we'll see, I find it interesting animality? you're interested in animality? The dollar-bill uses mickey mouse mickey mouse. max, could you go and get the two? The models? What are your plans, rena? I don't know yet depends on how long I will be able to stay here but I would love to be here in berlin for a while I read an article on your weird company, oop. Is it still around? Weird? I don't think I really understood it yea, sure are you going to use it for the project? Oop? Maybe, yes so let's go can anybody tell me what's going to happen? Isn't that a question for your brother? You think he'd know? Tony, you're so fond of the subject tell me what comes to mind — animal + logo when you look at our two models? Imagine what would be needed to transform two .. ...2 people ... into animals, where would that start for example ... ...their gaze... even when you stand in front of them, animals can't look at you butterfly comes home little bear comes home kangaroo comes home lights are shining, the day is over codfish swims home elephant runs home ant dashes home lights are shining, the day is over fox and goose come home it's good we're still here so that I can explain everything myself all apartments have their peculiarities good night I won't be here much anyway everything is sleeping and everything is awake everything is weeping and everything is laughing everything keeps silent and everything speaks I thought I'm going to make a work with animals etc, I'll have a go, at least this week after that I have to leave for a couple of days anyway I wanted to understand the animal as a room a room like this one here and therefore the room vibrates, the walls are soft and react to touch + the walls, which are like leather, have tattoos or logo-tattoos, maybe for my corporate-concept oop yes +originally I wanted to do something about power, political power, in berlin. So I planned to interview all the secretaries of state and portray them as I did in the context of my project in madrid well, it stirred up quite a lot of eh? —In spain, in the press, I think no? Yes I am not into unmasking power, I add masks therefore I would need no studios, no models, simply help to contact the state departments no problem, karsten will you do that? + the whole model thing can just be canceled ok, why not, I could have used the money, but 400 euros isn't 50 much I'm pretty pissed off, if the job had really lasted a few days what? how many days? every day? great! shit. that's really shit, fuck you just destroyed 2 jobs. bravo just because you think you don't need anybody, 2 people get dumped and this is about quite a bit of money something you don't care about because people like you always have money, but are you sick? shut up, now what's going on? Take him away kai, what did you say to her? I was just joking it's not up to rena whether people work with you, is it? Mrs. yazka, please wait a moment you can call me rena I have no idea what kai was saying .. Why do 2 people get fired, just because I'm not working with them I don't know, but if nobody needs them... what do I have to do with it? Nothing, of course, I'm really sorry, and it is a bit embarrassing for me, kai is my brother I don't want to seem like a monster that doesn't care about anything, but really, christoph karsten karsten, you know, I've just arrived and all of a sudden I have to worry who is whose brother sure >...alive like a puma in PUMA. shall we wait? or do you have to look at the paper? I've also just had another appointment take a seat do you still come here often? Actually no. too bad you weren't at the generali opening I wouldn't have expected it so relaxed in their main-office it was really great, pure energy an earthquake you're being sarcastic sorry, it wasn't intended I asked flor walter to come, for I don't know how to help you further with PUMA people from PUMA's marketing department think CC is interesting + you, too but PUMA do not want anybody messing around with their logos. but you know that you'll find a solution no, I won't. you're too ambitious 13, but less is not enough, no? Maybe PUMA is not investing in berlin but they have to, where else, nuremberg? No, but maybe prague, or lituania, I don't know but this art-content we're producing is totally international. they can make use of it anywhere maybe in london, but not in riga here is flor flor? is there something between you both? Don't be silly. Hello, flor human and animal meet in the slave. In the beautiful slave +it is only the slave what? loves his master, or who hates him is somebody questioning the basic principles of democratic freedom? That's quite good are you an animal rights activist? No, funny, not at all. I like it though but why do you like it? Why do you? I asked first I'm still studying it normally I think it's stupid when humans play animals bit here it is kind of >small maybe I don't like it. or do I? What is max marshall doing over there? Is he is trying to impress us? I once saw a piece of him in a stockholm exhibition. Actually, I hated it don't be nasty sorry for yesterday that's 0.k., now you're getting your money don't be mean how are the young animals? photogenic? Everything ok., rena yazka? Fine, max marshall. but tell me, what are you up to ? That's what I'm trying to figure out moira, that's not bad, is it? That's enough for today are we going out together? Yes, don't we - you have plans? I've got an invitation for tonight, I guess. But I don't care, I can pretend I got lost. I am not familiar with berlin, right? Where are you staying in berlin? Me? Am I talking to my computer? I'm staying with an old friend of mine, not of mine, but of a good friend of mine actually that friend is my mother but you're living with your brother, I hear. What's wrong with your brother? I don't have a brother — which might not be such a disadvantage, right? Why not asta, wait, it's so crowded here, I can't hear you you always call me from the metro - gone... wha's that? Ah, you're back you spit on him? That has happened to me once, too your girlfirend? Ieave me alone ok. are you bored sometimes? Why do you want to know? Do you think animals don't experience boredom? And boredom is something you don't experience $0 you think I could have something that you don't? And? And? Are you sometimes bored? perhaps often sure. everybody knows boredom don't tell me it's something you've never experienced? Karsten, go home, leave us the key don't worry, I can wait give the key to your brother, you can trust him I wouldn't even trust him with himself where is he? Come on, kai, I'll just undress you. ok? This is stupid martine, do you want to join us? Is it about sex? Kai, is it about sex? How should I know? No, I don't think so am I supposed to help ? From now on I'll bite come here I didn't get anything out of you did I annoy you last night? Were you very drunk? I was. well, about average shall we get up? O.k., sure everybody's up already? May I introduce myself, I'm hylia caro kai, kai starel wasn't it a bit tight for you 2 in the tiny room? Rena, I'm so sorry we're still here are you still ok in the small room? Not too bad, but at CC they're busy finding a guest apartment no rena, the day after tomorrow we'll be off I've got to go, what about you? Are you rena yazka? Why? My name is anja noll, I work over there in the hajo nussbaum gallery people told me you're in town may I introduce you? this is thorsten rihrtal he's in town and I am showing him around have we met? I guess in barcelona, 6 weeks ago thorsten participated in the group show at the barcelona museum... yea I've got to go, are you leaving, too? We are leaving, 100 you've just arrived from barcelona? No, bochum, but it's nice here I have to go universal animal we have to go for the ultimate extreme advertising, money, that's all part of the story your bodies will be dismembered arms and legs are going on to live like earthworms or snakes all of a sudden the stomach bursts, a baby zombie appears, vomiting money then it creeps sideways like a crab there are techno-fascists claiming a baby zombie is just as dull as a crab the money is then used by fundamentalists to buy arms for terror attacks the whole thing is edited sharp-edged in a continuous loop just like some nigerian zombie films are you all that sick here? Hey karsten, everything with jork and me is cancelled why didn't you tell me? Kai, your cell phone was dead yea, shit, right. It should have been switched on yea, but not by me, by you can I touch some of the money already? Well, it has to be transferred. but I'll talk to monika wagner let's work together. I'll have this sculpture built on a ship, that's going to be great let's work together. I'll have this sculpture built on a ship, that's going to be great plastic animals, cut into pieces and wrongly put together a ship, floating in front of the universal building the whole universal claim as baby poo I'll make them do it, they like it it is still a little bit too much for them, half a million,but we'll manage we'll join up with your company, oop and add a campaign the sculpture of the universal beat, clips of universal and oop on all channels, which universal own anyway and at the same time for a product that doesn't exist blah blah and then use your thing with melancholy no, marting, don't get me wrong, but it's not really my style that has to be printed just like that if possible was is that extreme? No, it was great, and clear are you going to write I think berlin is stupid? I didn't say that kai, yea, hi, yea, I have an idea. I will work with you a kind of portrait, as animal wait a moment, rather beautiful. it's about a present, a gift to the animal you love am I the present? no? $0 you are not in love with me no, wouldn't have matched. can we meet? Wait a moment. so, don't fool around and don't use me to get at generali, right? Maybe see you tonight? They say, there is something smoking f.e. marlboro, camel peter stuyvesant, ernte 23, kim that's what I wanted to say when we met for the first time I don't even know anymore when it was I am not that old aha somebody to explain the world which world longs for explanation? Rena, wait a second. flor, may I introduce you to rena yazka? we were talking about her nice to meet you I just talked to kai... stachel (thorn) Got it kai starel - you'll transform him into an animal, I'm curious, really curious he doesn't look like like an animal? Curious me? You don't like carl? Do you live far away from here? I'm fine, I can walk. I can give you a ride, no problem. 0.k. Actually I find you very handsome ah really? I have to go to disseldorf on thursday, you could drive me I'm not your driver money doesn't sleep roy, little roy, you're not going to be a werewolf what's rena doing in the hallway in that strange position? I asked her, but she didn't answer maybe it's her time of the month maybe what's going on in here? Yoga? Rena, why didn't you inform me? I talked to the secretary of state a couple of times and suddenly you are not going to work with them? I'm sick $0 sorry no, I am asking you. at CC they say you'll finance it you don't have to comment on it I am just informing you, we have an well written article here and it says you have decided to engage in CC in order to add to the energy in your logo, the animal that you expect a better public communication "by use of the different synergic effects of international art works" our journalist wonders if you are aware that CC's background... that Carl Celler worked in the meat industry before he was thrown out, alleged for doping chemics found in meat that makes you laugh? o.k., as you like what crap! But you didn't believe a word, no? Yes, thanks for calling us that was the 3rd call adrian saller, PR at PUMA, called, he also received one of those idiotic calls florian task of generali was talking to that guy for nearly an hour, what an idiot! He nearly put him through to mayer, then it dawned on him that something was wrong what was it about? I've forgotten now it has to be me who can't come up with anything. Now it has to be me who can't come up with anything. Finally, maybe I don't like animals I could have been warned fucking animals am I interrupting a conversation? Yeah may I ask a question? No anybody still need jork or me? I would prefer to leave tony just found out, she always wanted to do something about dogs do-a-dog, that's something you are capable of, right? Did you have pets when you were small? I still have a cat at home. I could go and get her the poor cat, I haven't thought of her for ages how does it work, and in which context an us president, hijacked by animals, sending videomessages, that has many layers but that's too inverse-stereotyped - no meaning, stop making sense, that's been around for 30 years we have to deal with a completely different situation, meaning is exactly our material you misunderstand me. of course you work on meaning you show the iraqi flag, and there's some meaning but how you make use of this flag as tablecloth or as rag then you won't ask if that is going to sully the nation's honor or >criticize< those who do so how will these elements be implicated in a campaign, what type of commodity? And don't get me wrong, it doesn't have to be a soup, or a film it could also be art, the product is then the art to have a piece of art be advertising for itself that would be the difference between so-called art and so-called city-marketing we have to get rid of the idea of using animals based on their characteristics fox for smartness, tiger strength, panther speed + therefore the car, that is morphing into a panther, is fast I thought I would like to film you tonight tonight? When it's quieter. maybe around 9. Around 9 ok? Just us? I told another friend, a camerawoman, about it, she'll be there too you're alright, rena? Yea. and you? All animals are equal I've got enough now, thanks let's have a look slowly, slowly, watch out for the camera once this was franz but now, franz' eyes are used by a turtle if franz — or what used to be franz - says I can see you we do not know what he means but franz, or what used to be franz, is still into style he still cares what he wears that's as far as we've got but we're working on it I have a different idea for the cast: peaches, but she's not ready to do it for nothing the whole budget is already spent and lacoste, that's not working rena? What kind of shit got into your head doing that interview in the berliner zeitung? It's already out? What did you think, they wouldn't print it? What >it Well, what should I call it? puke maybe are you angry nobody interviewed you? No, rena, really, at least you could have talked to us what's so terrible about it? Did you read it? No, but I said it, I hope so, at least il get it rena is here. she has no idea what she's supposed to have said that was so bad one question you're interrupting kai, what's up? I have to discuss this with can celler not now is it true what tony just told me, that I'm not supposed to come anymore? Ah, I wasn't aware of it. but kai, don't be like that we can discuss it later did you make all the calls? What calls? Don't pretend to be dumb, you're not as dumb as that telephone calls, just calls ok, that's enough, but I think everybody's had enough of you. this was just your last day you think it was kai, who made all the calls, that's interesting but if he's not needed here anymore, then he could work as my driver can I have a look at the berliner zeitung? Here $0, did you say it or didn't you? Yes and no, I didn't say >berlin is nothing but provincial but? Maybe that there is something provincial very funny, rena, but of course you can say what you want thanks, I do but I was afraid they would use me as an excuse for their own - puke it was agreed that I would get to read the article before, but that didn't happen but we can't sue them for misrepresenting you, can we? Right rena, wait a moment, they fired me kai's been fired? No, but everybody is simply through with him is that true? I don't know then we'll get back on him let's just start, do you need something to take with you? I mean, you're back tomorrow or the day after. I've got everything with me no, right? Yes, hmm, that's ok with me. I have enough material but the day after tomorrow, can I shoot some more? No, but I definitely need some sound from you some sound? Only one sentence, the animal talks at the end. so we have to go to my place we have to go, we can do the sound recording somewhere here oh, no could you speak the sentence I will, won't I? The sentence is: I can talk I can talk? what kind of joke is that? Could you wait outside. I just need one second money isn't like flowers, or have you ever found money on the street? But do flowers grow on the street? I'll give you something. not that I have much. and you'll have your driver's fee, don't forget and the return trip? By train. I'll buy you a first class ticket, if you want I want to fly fly? You do want something from me? I just started to think you want something from me your mating-dance every time I see you I don't court boys you're not so prissy with girls? What's up? I thought you were offering something what, now I'm totally confused you're gay, right? Well, I should probably know something about that? So let's go for the great liberation. let's have sex ah, little boy, that's something you have to learn karsten, are you asleep? sorry. but I need somebody for postproduction, tomorrow could you call generali? I want to make a small presentation tomorrow huh? sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about tomorrow I'm off. I'm pretty much finished you're leaving? Yea, didn't think I would be through so soon could you tell celler that I want 10 talk 10 him. min the studio did you hear something about kai? Should I have? Would be nice if he came before I leave you wanted to talk to me? Kai! kai, I can hear you did I wake you up? yes, I'm not in disseldorf flor walter suddenly wanted to go alone. no idea. no, you don't know him I won't come back. now I'm visiting father chichi is still there isn't she? no, by train. You're not watching? I'll be back in in a minute something wrong? No, no. — have you heard anything about kai. the police were here this morning why! what did they want? are they still there? No, they left. kai's done something stupid. flor walter reported him shit hi rena, at CC they were saying you're leaving. I borrowed flor walter's cell phone I brought my cat, chichi, I stole it from my father, she's really cute. you'll see are you there? no, that's not possible GIVE YOUR PET SOMETHING PRECIOUS I'll go straight to generali, that's today, right? did you use our material? how am I? see you later 15 SECONDS HUMAN this is flor walter consulting. please leave a message. Kai, I just tried to call you as flor walter. It didn't work. I'll try again as me what did you do? the police was here but not for me? Flor walter reported you. what did you do to him? The film has started are you mrs. yazka? No, why? I have to go will we meet? Well, now's not the best moment could you say something concerning the whereabouts of kai starel?
